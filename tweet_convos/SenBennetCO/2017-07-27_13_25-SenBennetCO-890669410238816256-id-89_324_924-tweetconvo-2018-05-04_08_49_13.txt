Please fight for Colorado Senator Bennet!
Thank you for your impassioned remarks.
Keep up the good work in support of what's right for the people of Colorado and the USA !!!
Thank you!

Another reason WE are proud to be Coloradans!!!  Thank you & ALL of your staff, aides & interns working tirelessly for US!
Absolutely! Thank you all! We need you to speak and protect us in Colorado!
Magnificent! Well spoken @SenBennetCO Thank you for showing us there are still some Statesmen in this country.
Why don't we ask @SenCoryGardner wasn't he on the #deathpanel #boysclub #copolitics #SaveMedicaid #SaveACA #HealthCareVote #HealthcareBill
Thank you for fighting for your constituents, Senator.
He's fighting for the nation! My Arizona Senators went limp, so thank you!
Michael Bennett and John McCain are traitors to the American people.
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/890669410238816256 … (Ranked 1st for Jul 27.)
Excellent speech!!!
Cyber hugs from Colorado. Keep fighting!
Thank You @SenBennetCO !
A lot of people who rely on Medicaid programs may not be at all what you expect. early intervention is everything!
Thank you @SenBennetCO for hard work. Now we need our friend @SenCoryGardner to step up and listen to HIS constituents as well.
Michael Bennett: We want a full repeal of the ACA (obamacare), no replacement and refund the IRS fines.
Give en hell Senator Bennet!
Thanks for standing up for our best interests Sen Bennet. The GOP wants to say they repealed at expense of healthcare.
Your disappointing sir. Hypercritical obstructionist
Grateful we have one senator who has our backs. Thanks from @LaPlataCountyCO
thank u senator for your passion. u r truly a man of the people #rockstar #colorado #healthcare #cometogether
Go get em! The hypocrisy of the @GOP is unbelievable and the idiocy of @SpeakerRyan and his master @realDonaldTrump is now legendary

Proud of my senator. Keep fighting!
Watch “The Bill of Rights for Persons with Developmental Disabilities &ndash; Arc Industries” on #Vimeo
It never has to be this way again! know the hard to watch history https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xPvQpWEdxoY … and do what's right to fund community living
Thank you Senator Bennet!

People need people. It's a beautiful truth. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PD04yP4n-A&sns=tw … via @youtube
I have to admit, it's nice to see @SenBennetCO finally stand up to Trump a little bit. Better late than never.
Who were you taking to? I didn't see anyone in seats.
ditto
@SenCoryGardner GOP only cares about passing a bill, any bill so they can claim a win.  #Sad #CountryBeforeParty
We cannot move backwards on services for adults with developmental disabilities. Colorado will be limited by TABOR and HCBS services damaged
Can't accept backsliding on Medicaid funding for adults with developmental disabilities. Not really what I want our country to be known for
Vote No on the skinny.
Thank you @SenBennetCO for fighting for us. Please don't stop fighting. Resist!!!
Really? Seems like no one had time to read the ACA before it was passed. Tax payers should not be required to subsidize anyone's healthcare
Watching- 8:20 and where's the Bill
You are doing a great job!
Mike, Mike, Mike. They've only had 7 years. These things take *time.*
Thank you @SenBennetCO! Unlike @SenCoryGardner, you actually listen to your constituents.
That is my Senator.  At least we have one in Colorado who is firmly in touch with reality. Thanks, Senator Bennet!
You have to pass the bill to see what's in the bill. Sound familiar?
except there was a bill then. Now, nothing
One GOP to another: What bill?

Another:  Bill who?

3rd: Clinton?
Proud to call you my Senator!
Thank you #SenatorBennet for speaking out for #America and for #Colorado! Keep the fight up! Call them out when they are out of order!
Thank you so much for fighting for us. Xo
@SenCoryGardner this is what it looks like to care about Colorado. 11/3/20
Did the #GOP really want you to sign something you hadn't read. Didn't your mama teach you guys better?
Great speech. Please advocate for universal healthcare.

Thank you thank you senator for fighting for us. It's not about states or party but what's good for all Americans

@SenCoryGardner Be a leader, cross the aisle and help figure this out! That could be your legacy! Not this awful, secret, bipartisan crap.

Clown.
Thank you for working for Coloradans. 
Keep fighting, @SenBennetCO. I'm impressed.
Why are you even commenting on this it is clear that your party has no interest in solutions. Just can't get rid of the legacy.
@engbobplott you make good sense.  Obviously our Senators should vote for the bill they have never seen and have had no role in creating.
You should have voted yes on the first repeal and replace bill.
Thank you, Sir for fighting!! We're flooding calls & emails. This is insanity!
Keep fighting, Sen Bennet! My family is with you & thanks you for fighting for healthcare! #ProtectOurCare
Thank you, Senator!!
So much fun debating amorphous objects. Like discussing which ghost is loudest and biggest.
Thanks for this, Senator.
Thank you Senator! Appreciate that you are listening and fighting for CO and US. #SaveACA
That's was dupe senator.
Keep speaking truth to power. You are our only voice in that room
#NoRepeal #FixACA
Please, please, please try to get through to your Republican colleagues. They don't care what the voters have to say, clearly.
Thanks so much, Senator Bennet.  I'm grateful for your hard work against this travesty.

you'll need to lose your 100% paid ins. for life and pay 100% of your on then they might care abought the rest of us
Thank you for really stepping up and taking on the concerns of Coloradans! 
So, so, embarrassing it is disgusting.
Looks like there's no quorum either
Thank you Mr. Bennett for having our backs!
Thank you Senator! @SenCoryGardner he's talking to YOU.
GOP health care bill == emperor's new clothes?  
Colorado thanks you!! Keep pushing!!
