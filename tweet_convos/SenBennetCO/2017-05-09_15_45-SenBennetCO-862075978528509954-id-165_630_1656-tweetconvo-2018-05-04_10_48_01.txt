Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/862075978528509954 … (Ranked 1st for May 9.)
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
You must work to find at least two Rs who will support you. Unfortunately, I believe the future of this country is at stake.
Make this happen! What about @SenCoryGardner? Still choosing party over country?
I suggest finding a good safe space.
Thank you, please keep demanding this!
Indeed!!
Yes
Please stand up for this immediately. Allegiance to country (& constitution) above party. #SpecialProsecutor
We need one big independent investigation on both Russia influences and US Government leaks. Once complete, maybe we can reunite again?
Please demand it! CO and our democracy are counting on you!! Don't back down.
Thank you. I will keep calling, as well. WE MUST REMAIN DILIGENT! 
What's downside of a special prosecutor? Will it set the FBI investigation back will it continue alongside the special investigation?
I think that was clear from the beginning.  But now it is crucial. You need to fight!
When the Senate going to do something about this president who has a total disregard for the law?
@potus Their is no Russian connection and you thought Comey cost Hillary the election you should be happy hypocrite.
Why is Dems answer to everything more gov, special panels, committees....just pissing tax money away.
thank you senator Bennett!!
It will never happen, the cover up continues to grow exponentially.
Yes Sir.
What Russian connections?
It must be done now! 
BS, no evidence of Russian connections.  Try doing something productive.
How long does it take you geniuses. The double standard makes me vomit.
Please follow up your words with swift action to see that a special prosecutor is appointed!
I believe more is needed. Executive and judicial branches compromised. Use us to help you Senator
Please continue to push for this. Thank you.
Yup. I just called y'all and was told this exactly! Ty to @CoryGardner @RepPerlmutter
and could you please address this handmaids tale shit going on with the health care committee in the Senate?
And the a new FBI dir David Clark to lock Hillary up
I absolutely agree. Please push for this on behalf of your constituents and all Americans.
Thank you, Senator!
Amen!
What it raises is a way for the Democrats to cry foul that's it there is no evidence linking the president to Russia. Angry Democrats is all
Thank u for saying we need a special prosecutor @SenCoryGardner care to make a statement & put country over party? #whereiscory
Thank you!
Yes, that's exactly what needs to happen ASAP - No Delays! #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #independentinvestigation #Collusion #SaveUS
Sooooo... when Bill Clinton fired the FBI that was ok and no prosecutors needed?
Mr. Bennet, we've asked you daily to represent Coloradans and our values. We need you to stand up to obvious treasonous activity #represent
Thank you.    We need to hear from @SenCoryGardner with the same message.
Thank you for representing us on this one.  Keep fighting.  @indivisiblefrr #IndependentInvestigation
I've called daily to ask for an investigation. Please tell us what you have done so far.
We've been asking you and the senate to act on this for months. I have also called our office of homeland security. No excuses. Get to work.
Yes, please!
Thank you, Senator Bennet!
You're right, we need a #SpecialProsecutor, to ensure our
#ChecksAndBalances are protected.
CC: @SenCoryGardner
Care to comment @SenCoryGardner?? Your silence is deafening. #independentProsecutor #investigate #Putinspuppet
@CoryGardner can we as a state agree on this?  We need a unified front on this now, more than ever.
Thank you from Colorado!
Thank you Sen Bennett! Only hope that Sen Gardner recognizes his duties to his country on this matter! #CoryGardner #independentProsecutor
Thank you Senator.
Thank you Senator Bennet. Our democracy demands that we get to the truth.
Please demand a special prosecutor!!! Don't allow POTUS to hide behind distractions!
Please make it happen, now!
Pls. use all of your power and influence as a representative of CO to demand a sp.  prosecutor to continue and extend the investigation.
Push for special prosecutor. This administration is definition of corruption.
When will Congress say enough is enough? #impeach #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
And please don't delay. Our country is being compromised, we are vulnerable for attack, have very little experience in critical roles. #Coup
This guy needs to be impeached. But, a special prosecutor is a good start. Make it happen, sir!
How about Kenneth Starr?  Because he worked so well on the last major President special investigative case?
Yes Comy is crooked and covering up the corrupt people glad hes gone
Yes PLEASE!! I'm afraid to think this may lead to something, please stay firm! 80122 and NOT paid
Yates would be a good investigator. I heard she's free for the position.
Hilarious! You were calling for his head in October 2016 & now he's your best friend. #zerocredibility
So you don't agree with the letter by Dep AG Ron Rosenstein? Typical hypo - HRC would of fired day 1 and Dems would praise her leadership
As a constituent of yours I say please make this happen.  Whether they find anything or not this is he only way to trust it.
I have called your DC office and sent an email requesting you support and advocate for a special prosecutor
Please investigate Trump. None of this is ok or normal!
Please help get this done. The world is rejecting Trump's ilk. He is not a legitimate President.
Not really.  Comey lost credibility long time ago.
@watchyourSen Yes Senator Bennet, we need one now. We are counting on you.
Yes! Are  you going to suggest it?
Thank you, @SenBennetCO! Surprised to see this, but I should've checked sooner. I'll stop calling you out about a #SpecialProsecutor.
Thank you for your common sense. How many GOP senators/congressmen are with you? We need Gardner/Coffman to get some balls too plz.
Yes, @SenCoryGardner, @RepMikeCoffman, @RepKenBuck - CO Demands That You Speak Up For #IndependentCommission #IndependentInvestigation
Please get this done for us.
Thank you for this! We absolutely have to have a special prosecutor at this point, and an independent commission. I appreciate your stance!
It's time for the GOP to put our country over their party. #SpecialProsecutor
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR NOW! We have to stop this
of coarse they don't need him anymore he threw the election towards them he's excess baggage and can go collect his Swiss  bank account now
Best to get him to testify before he flees the country
Please do everything that you can to get that done.  My husband is available and was the best and longest serving Criminal Chief at USDOJ.
James R Allison, Retired USDOJ District of Colorado...You might have heard of him. Give him a call!
Yes Senator, all other biz needs to stop until a prosecutor is appointed & we have answers! This is outrageous & an assault on our democracy
This - and many reactions on the Hill to firing - is a shocking understatement. US just slipped into dictatorship and people are like "meh"?
please please please fight the @GOP and do NOT allow them to close the investigation.  this is an authoritarian coup, pure and simple.
and we in Co. expect you to do your job! do not vote on anything from this admin. Get these questions answered, fight for this country!
Yes please organize this
Well then,  quit tweeting about it and get it done.  Represent your constituency.
Questions such as, “What are you going to do about this?”
You are correct sir! Please whip people up and get an independent independent investigation going. This is a clear violation of & 
#ComeyAndYatesForSpecialProsecutor
yes please make it happen @MaxineWaters @SenCoryGardner
Thank you Senator Bennet. Please stay on top of this.
Are you having one-on-one conversations about this with your Republican colleagues? They MUST begin putting country over party. #COMEY
Thank you, sir! Our country is under attack from the inside. We need courageous patriots now! Thank you for fighting for us.
@realDonaldTrump fires FBI Dir Comey, and Sally Yates, investigating Trump Russia collusion, Sessions Involved, Trump is Guilty, COVER UP!!
Trump needs to be impeached ASAP.
A combination stench of authoritarian & fascism is drifting out of DC this evening @SenCoryGardner @RepMikeCoffman
As in RIGHT NOW-SPECIAL PROSECUTOR-INDEPENDENT COMMISSION demanded!!! This is NOT a dictatorship!!!!!!!
One thing is clear: you need to investigate Obama's admin. spying on everyone, especially presidential candidates!
Investigate, please!!
Thank you @SenBennetCO  we are counting on you.  Our democracy is at stake.
@RepMikeCoffman and @SenCoryGardner Do the right thing and call for independent counsel immediately.  #CountryOverParty
That's the America I knew when I was kid - Dallas soap opera (Well while waiting for my mother to finish watching it so I could watch Lupin)
@SenCoryGardner Just wondering what Coward Cory is thinking? Some Trump group will give him $$$ to stay quiet.
Thank you for standing up for your constituents and democracy! Demand it loudly and don't back down! 
I sure hope someone is watching to make sure Trump doesnt have his minions destroying evidence over at the FBI
Justice will not be served without a special prosecutor.
Thank you for saying so.  We will keep calling. #resist.
Thank you. This needs to be top priority
@SenateDems should refuse to cooperate in Government until a special independent investigator is appointed.
We Must have an Independent investigation !!!!!
Get Hillary to investigate, she is honest just like Bill.
We Coloradans would like you to take the lead.  #comeyfired
Thank you from an engaged constituent.
My choice for FBI director is SALLY YATES
Well Trump would have to nominate her and that's not happening.
Of course not
Thank you Senator, from a constituent in Denver.
Duh  A lot of us have been asking Congress to push for a special prosecutor for months. #TrumpRussia
please make sure this happens
Lmao!!!  Ya killin me puppet bennet!
Who can make that happen? 
Would Congress need to approve it?
Thank you. To your colleagues, Anything less than calling for a full independent investigation is complicity and history will judge harshly
Your GOP colleagues won't hear of it!
I agree with you, Senator. To the phones, everyone!
This needs to happen immediately!
Absolutely! @SenCoryGardner Where is your statement demanding an independent special prosecutor?!
Go fish @SenBennetCO
@SenateDems @SenateGOP #IndependentProsecutor
Just called your ofc and Gardner's office to request independent investigation. No more delays. This needs to happen.
18 months is as long as trump has. Nov 2018 the Dems get the house and impeachment will begin
ICYMI @SenFeinstein said "no evidence of #russian interference."
Sen Feinstein should retire immediately.
Thank you for being a voice of sanity in the Senate! This is the only way we will find the truth!
Yeah like, "what took so long".
Absolutely so when is this going to happen?
not going to happen in this Brave New World.
Senator, you need to fight for this with everything you've got. Our democracy depends on it. Thank you.
Yes please
An independent special prosecutor is more important now than ever! Thank you and keep fighting for one!
Please keep pushing for this. Thank you.
Can you convince @SenCoryGardner of that? He seems to vote with the Pres on everything regardless of how bad it is for #Colorado #USA
Just called @SenCoryGardner and @RepTipton  to say the same.
