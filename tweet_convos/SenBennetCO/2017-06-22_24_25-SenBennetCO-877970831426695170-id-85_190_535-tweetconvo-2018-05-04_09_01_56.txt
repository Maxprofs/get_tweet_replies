Pls fix healthcare. We can hardly afford $1200/mo w $13k deductible. Cheapest plan w Kaiser. Don't mind high deductible but premium too high
We are Colorado residents who own our own business
What would the DEMS healthcare bill be like if senators had to rely on it like American citizens do? Must be nice to be elite.
Can you help me understand why the GOP rather have people like me die, then to help us? I'm a person, not a profit.
completely unrelated to the shit storm.. thank you Senator Bennet. We appreciate you.
Please enlighten the others who are undecided, on why this is passive genocide of sick Americans. Survival of the richest is just obscene.
Thank you for your understanding! So proud to have you as our senator.
Withhold consent. Filibuster by amendment.
Agreed. It's time to fight this with every tool you've got. This bill is cruel & inhumane! Thank you @SenBennetCO lives are at stake
Speaker said he is considering limiting debate on each amendment to 2 min. Time for Dems to get feisty & creative in fighting this debacle
Will you support single payer health care?
Now please tell @SenCoryGardner to join you in voting NO for this disastrous #HealthcareBill !  Time to put People over Party!
Humanity tainted the Earth, air, water. Profiters ignore reality & Hcare. We suffer w/high rates of illness/disability. #autismisevolution
Bipartisan & transparent, kind of like 8 years of Obama? #hypocrite
Work for single payer in Colorado if you're truly concerned about Coloradans.
What are you going to do about @SenCoryGardner ?  Can you convince home to vote against the bill?
can you get @SenCoryGardner to listen to his constituents?
@SenBennetCO Thank you for opposing it! Please do all you can to help us keep ACA. CO can't afford to lose our healthcare protections.
I love how your statement is exactly what republicans asked foe before the last healthcare bill passed.  Thank you for the double standard.
And where is your bill fixing the ACA?
You will do anything you can against this new administration @SenBennetCO . I have no respect for you! Learn to serve the ppl of CO.
Cause thats worked out great so far...
PLEASE do everything you can to stop this!!! We can't let people die. We need a plan and those poor people outside @SenateMajLdr office 
@SenBennetCO Thank you for standing up for the rights of Coloradans to get healthcare.  My life depends on #ACA and 10 essential benefits
We deserve single payer, which you and @TheDemocrats opposed. Now we are stuck with 2 bad options. #SinglePayerNow
Talk to good friend @SenCoryGardner and tell him not to kill people
Please vote NO on this bill.
Have you called @CoryGardner ?? Let him know you thoughts?
Well senator get off your duff and put forward some ideas try to help don't be a chronic bellyacher
@SenateGOP @SenSchumer  yea!! Keep #aca for 2 more years #carriers  avail? Premiums? @TheDemocrats say #aca is the best!!
Agree! Elderly and poor suffer under Senate Trumpcare. Wealthy (like me) get $$. Senate bill is greedy and immoral. Vote Colorado not Party!
Agree! .@SenCoryGardner Agree Senator Bennett! Bad job Senator Gardner
You spend the whole day with @SenCoryGardner and that's the only post you can make?!
Trying to save the Titanic and it has already sunk.
Obamacare is unaffordable on all levels. 5 k deductibles 1 k per mo premiums are a joke. Subsidies come from our tax dollars. Nothing free!
The Dems said vote for it, then you can read it.  Not much more secret than that!!
Thank you. This bill is a shameful travesty & we need people of moral courage to stand up & fight it. Hear us @SenCoryGardner?#notpaid 80304
Yes, we do! Talk with @SenCoryGardner -- he was in the GOP group of 12.
You're going to fight this with everything you've got, aren't you, senator?
you sir do not represent me and I will proudly vote against you next time around.

Work with Dem/Ind colleagues to offer a fix. Go on offensive! We all agree it's the worst. Okay ...... next?
Thank you, Senator fo hearing us in Colorado!!
Stop resisting Bennet! You're a disgrace to Colorado and America! Obozo care is dead and far worse than anything on the table today.
Then sit down all of you government SERVANTS and come up with something like you all enjoy for the American people. Work together please!
Like there was 'full & open debate' re Obamacare? #hypocrit
There were committee hearings, bum
Why did you not call for a "full and open debate" when you voted for Obamacare?  My premiums and deductibles have increased.
We Coloradans rejected the liberal single payer system, we want choices not a mandate. We don't want to pay fir coverage we don't need.
Speak for yourself! I'm all for it! Anything is better than obozo care.
Stop politicizing our healthcare GOP AND Dems. DC is failing us. Bi-partisan solutions is answer. Work togethet
US citizens want the same health care options provided to the US Congress.  Please make that happen.  Inferior coverage for citizens?
Shut up democraps, you guys blew it with obumer care now get out of the way.
Thank You
Will you benefit from the healthcare tax cut?  â€“ if so your blood is on it too. Fight harder, fight smarter, for all Americans not only CO!
Thank you for standing up for us and I hope you do everything in your power to be sure this horrible bill fails. #HealthcareBill
What are you telling your colleague and co-author Sen Gardner? Speak the truth the bill is a death sentence for millions of Americans and me
Please do everything you can to stop this travesty. GOP is has lost sight of who they represent-US!
Thank you
Please, please stop all senate activity until this happens
Thank you for supporting your constituents and making sure our voices are heard.
We may end up approving our own single payer after all.
I've read that Democrats can add an infinite number of amendments to this bill, and tie this thing up for a looong time. True?
We need single payer now for everyone, and these old white republicans put to pasture.
You are absolutely correct Senator. We can not allow death panels and putting old defensless and ill children on the street. Let start there
How about a bipartisan backbone that stands up to ins companies & big pharma to decrease healthcare costs?
they'd have to turn away from all that $$
They could apply it to subsiding healthcare and CEOs could slash their salaries to a paltry few $mil/yr as cost of doing business.
I agree. Now convince @SenCoryGardner. He helped craft it but he doesn't want to own it.
Thanks for everything you do for CO, @SenBennetCO. I just called your office to urge you to fight this terrible bill in any way you can.
.@SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner I'd propose 1 week of debate for every 1 million people who might lose coverage. This is 1/6th of the economy.
Thank you for sticking up for Coloradoans and all Americans in this fight for life
Tell that to your colleague @SenCoryGardner !
Look who heads up House and Senate.  What do you expect?
Then please prevail on Sen.Gardner not to vote on this travesty. Senate must unite on non-partisan basis against bill & McConnell PLEASE!
BTW, I AM ONE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS.
Yes we do. Also, can you corner @SenCoryGardner and remind him that even poor ppl are his constituents and that we deserve representation?
Please talk some sense into Cory Gardner!
Thank you. I encourage you to withhold consent until  we get transparency and regular order. Demand bipartisan work on solving problems
So you read all 142 pages THAT fast? Hey at least it's better than the Obamacare bill that started at 2300 pages..
Did u read it that fast that makes u *sure* it's better than #ACA?
Reading it today. Never said it was better. Said at least it's not 2300 pages
Ahhh punctuation makes a difference . Twitter can make that challenging.
Any chance you can get @SenCoryGardner to see the light? This is terrible.
