Ok.  What do you call what the Democrats did to the middle class when they passed the ACA?  That was shameful.
#Shameful is the democrat obstruction to #Everything that #POTUS, who was legally elected, is attempting to achieve #law&order
Shameful is a citizen who doesn't know how his own government works.
The democrats passed the affordable care act without knowing what it would do did you cry then?
You are very confused or ill informed
Jim is a GOP bot.
And a very obvious one at that.
Fight for #MedicareForAll or stop pretending to be fighting for Coloradans and Americans.
Let's be more specific and remember how your CO colleague @SenCoryGardner voted. #oneterm
No your step in line Dem program is hurting Colorado and you have done nothing to fix it. You only represent donut hole of state
Thank you for your "no" vote.
What are you prepared to do about it? Filibuster with unlimited amendments? We expect ACTION, not just concern, from Senate Democrats.
Your voters are lunatics!
Have you addressed the millions harmed now by ACA? Premiums higher than house payments. Insurance but zero care at add'l $6K deductible.
I think you meant "trillions harmed". It'd be just as inaccurate.
Millions works. But they don't matter, right? More fun to pretend only the recipients of subsidized plans matter, I guess. Good luck to you.
OK, I'll bite. You have a reference for "millions harmed"?  What harm? Let's start there.
Write to or call Cory Gardner's office:
United States Senate 354 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington, DC, 20510
(202) 224-5941
I have called Senator Gardner so many times & always go to voice mail.  I leave a message but have doubts that he listens to Coloradans.
@SenCoryGardner Colo exchange doing good. Your excuse that you voted to start discussion on Repeal of ACA because it is failing is LAME.
This from the senator who supported & lied about the disastrous NObamacare law. #zerocredibility
Please share this story of this disabled 4 year old, this is why this repeal can NOT happen https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2020276408204390&id=1601121686786533 …
Thank you for standing strong, Senator Bennet.
Thank you for fighting for us and protecting Coloradans from the heartless @SenCoryGardner trying to strip our access to healthcare!
Why don't you focus more on #Colorado and less on party politics. If you think that @SenCoryGardner vote will hurt our state say so and why
@SenateMajLdr must have some dirt on every one of those guys.  Why else would they vote yes for a bill they haven't even seen?
Even more shameful that the @SenateDems are just as clueless and out of touch with Americans!
Cory Gardner needs to be voted out!  He doesn't care about any of us
Thank you, Senator, on behalf of my children especially.
Thank you for your no vote. Cory Gardner is an embarrassment to CO as is every Republican who voted yes today. Any chance you could slap CG?
Yeah and @SenCoryGardner is the shame of Colorado right now.
Thank you for your no vote, Sen.

Now *please* amend this killer bill to death. My family and all Coloradans desperately need a strong ACA.
It saved my brother.  He had a pre existing condition and lost his job related ins.  I don't know what he would have done without ACA.
Stand firm, please.
Load up on coffee and amend the living hell out of this garbage bill. And if you run into @SenCoryGardner tell him to answer his phones.
"could harm" Mikey did you really need a qualifier in your statement?not really sure yet?make sure you can cut&run
There's a real shocker, you voted no,  Coward, you're such a weak follower.
Please do everything you can to filibuster by amendment! We need you to amplify our voices. Thank you.
@SenBennetCO Thank you for your no vote
@SenCoryGardner pls start representing the people of CO instead of towing the party line
If the new HC bill still includes the same HC & Insurance racket, start over and focus on costs! @AAPSonline, @AtlasMD, @SurgeryCenterOK
Thank you for voting no, and for providing @SenCoryGardner a common sense approach to an alternative outcome. Too bad he didn't take it.
Offer millions of amendments. Do everything you can. We want to live. Show what the republicans are; evil radical conservative terrorists
Are you talking about the bill that will expand fracking in the US that you support?
Thank you for voting NO!!
Thanks for voting no. Another cowardly act by @SenateGOP.
Thank you Senator Bennet. I’m disgusted. @SenCoryGardner has betrayed his constituents
It's a shame that our junior senator @SenCoryGardner won't represent us!

Keep fighting for us please, @SenBennetCO!
Hypocrite! I'm being forced to buy health ins. or be penalized by the IRS even though I'm unemployed, thanks to YOU!
Just to say they did something,even though they don't know what they did-spiteful legislation and a damning vote for you @SenCoryGardner
The un-ACA is unusable for millions of us. It's a racket and just taxes way too much to pay for others. Address lowering costs! @AAPSonline
Yes it is.  Shameful.

Shameful @SenCoryGardner #Unseat2018
Thank you for your "no" vote. Continue fighting for us as if it's a matter of life and death, because it is.
Thank you for voting no on this sham legislation, @SenBennetCO
Thank U SenBennetCO & @SenateDems for the pile of crap #Obamacare. #Libertards prefer #DemocratLies & #FakeNews over facts. Obamcare is dead
Dems should just continually put forth "amendments" for Universal Healthcare and Single Payer.
Require congress to have same healthcare as everybody else
You should publicly challenge @SenCoryGardner on this. Make him face you in a televised debate. Your constituents deserve accountability.
killing us softly with their votes
You're no vote was the right vote.  Senator Cory Gardner shame shame shame shame shame. #coloradocorycare  pay more get less.
And Senator Gardner ? No special scorn for him ? You guys work for us. The residents of Colorado. Thank you for your no vote I heard it.
I really hope this means you're going to make Gardner's life as difficult as you possibly can until he helps protect this state.
.@SenBennetCO Thanks for your vote!  Let's get you an appropriate Senate colleague and #DumpCory2020.
Thank you for looking out for your constituents, unlike @SenCoryGardner.
Now time for you to fight! Protect #Medicare, protect #preexxistingconditions, protect #subsidies - Find a way to compromise @SenCoryGardner
Thank you Sen. Bennett. I wish Gardner loved our state so now he must be voted out.
Not nearly as shameful as the root cause of this colossal mess, which is Obamacare.
Thank you for voting no. This sickens me.
You had better have a long chat with your colleague @SenCoryGardner about how irresponsible he is to his constituents! Call him out!
Thank you for representing Coloradans in this vote, thank you for being our voice
Thank you for your "NO" vote.
Thank you for your NO vote!!
Have the guts to call out @SenCoryGardner BY NAME. He is part and parcel of this farce.
