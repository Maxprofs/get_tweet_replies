What's next? 
President Trump says he's now "moving on" to tax reforms http://bbc.in/2nltnQ4  
Now Sanders on @chrislhayes pushing his health care plan. He is Independent & should stay out of Democrat business.
HHS Tom Price is already planning to gut ACA sadly please hold him accountable
how about an aggressive democratic ground offensive to reach voters & remind them what's at stake
love it count me I have already started tell me where else to go to get it out please help
will start making calls on Monday although Pat Toomey only has voice message
i think= Your way of telling them "THANK YOU!" :)
Why are you not supporting HR676?  WTF
not to worry Senator, ACA will get repealed and replaced. How about u working for us and help make it better!!! B your own man!
please vote no on scotus!
#noongorsuch
I voted for you, & when I call DC to see where you stand on things, I'm ALWAYS told "he hasn't said."
vote YES for Judge Gorsuch! Outstanding Coloradan and best qualified for S.C.!
Maybe Trump and GOP should go for a moon shot next...
It's a DISGRACE when your offices won't give public statements on your planned cabinet or other votes.
Feel better?  What did you do in those seven years to fix the mess you created?
Support @BernieSanders Medicare for all plan or look to lose your job.  Coloradans overwhelmingly support this. Do your job.
Let's talk about Gorsuch, arch conservative seeking lifetime position. The fact that he's a home town boy should not be in a consideration.
Why are you concerned about "giving up"?  We have your government-run #ObamaCare for our healthcare.  #UOwnIt #COWontForget2022
Trump will not let us suffer long.  He will be on it again soon.
It isnt healthcare that needs fixed. it is insurance companies.
Bannon told him to. End of story.
it's the Democrats time to shine! Work together to fix it so we don't have to call it Trump care! #fixtheACA
I can live with that!
Pushed thru w/o bipartisan support in 2008. You now own #ObamaCare. #COWontForget2020
They haven't given up, they're just shifting the destruction elsewhere.
Now, please commit to #StopGorsuch !
LET THEM GIVE UP. #MedicareForAll
Yes, bc it would take democratic measures to deliver on promises.  Dems should propose their plan to expand coverage and lower costs.
I sure wish my rep @RepMikeCoffman would have listened to his constituents and not supported trumpcare. trump is not a leader.
never stop saying R's sat on hands 7yrs trying to repeal,not fix.And Prez WANTS this to fail.Point out how unAmerican that is
Dems need to fill leadership void.Point out lack of coop for 7yrs,inability to vote with all power and be the adults.U got this
sure...now he can blame Dems for not fulfilling his promise...he's a low intellect liar, carnival barker
tytyty.
please vot FOR Gorsuch for Supreme Court Justice.
@SpeakerRyan @RepDLamborn this is embarrassing.
you're better than this kind of partisan politics. Makes you no better than be other party.
Thank you for opposing that cash grab of a proposal.
Remember all those plans they offered over those 7 years? Oh yeah. Me neither.
y not work on repair of ACA?
Our new president has a very short attention span.
Have you seen what Trump is saying now? @realDonaldTrump  is twisted. You Donald lost!  Accept it
Its good that he's giving up, isn't it?
he doesn't play well with others. He DEMANDS.
But, but, but healthcare is, like, SO complicated.
please run for president. You've got my vote if you do.
Nobody knew governing could be so complicated!
Good. Now block any SCOTUS nominee not named Merrick Garland.
Thank you for ur support.  We cannot give up Senator! Time to look at single-payer options so everyone has HC! #MedicareForAll
Now it's time to FIX the ACA ..Universal health care in 2018.
Thank you for work in saving healthcare for Coloradans and other Americans who would not have it except for ACA!
only sensible health plan is medicare for all. would eliminate millions of overhead costs by insurance companies.
Honestly, awesome, but now work on fixes so costs come down & more get covered-please!
We are going to fight this short term President every step of the way we will not be bullied @indivisibleco6
Not surprised with spoiled Trump's impatience. Time to find Republicans now who are willing to work on bipartisan legislation?
if only your party would have fixed Obamacare like you outlined in your letter to Ryan.  You couldn't get it done Bennet.
of course they are, they have the attention span,and intelligence of a gnat
Shameless repubs steal Garland's seat and all you can say is "two wrongs don't make a right?" Are you giving up? #weobject
The unwillingness of both parties to work together is terrible!  It is time to put the countries needs first over party.
they've never been prepared. keep pushing for investigations! @SenCoryGardner @RepDianaDeGette @RepKenBuck
Gotta give it to you-that's pretty good.
How do we replace your red partner @SenCoryGardner with someone wanting to work for people not corps?  oh and @RepKenBuck too
Dont forget .@RepMikeCoffman He thought it was great to abandon 60k+ in his district too!
you've got to include @RepDLamborn too.
kind of hope they do. I like the ACA
Hopefully they recognize when they are outmatched. In this case by the American people!  Thank you Senator Bennet!

a good thing. Were trying to rush proposal through that left out vulnerable folks. Citizens spoke out.#democracyworks
afraid we'll see your plan fail? Time to work together Senator.
Thank you from Colorado!!
I'm still in shock that their grandstanding was *actually* so shallow. How are these people so unprepared to govern?
and he thought healthcare was "complicated"... 
the epitome of a party unready to govern in any degree. Keep holding them accountable.
He is such a joke @POTUS @IvankaTrump @oliviawilde @HillaryClinton @PerezHilton @ChelseaClinton @chelseahandler @CNNPolitics
So busy opposing they forgot they were there to govern.
