Thank you.
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/890323011668246532 â€¦ (Ranked 1st for Jul 26.)
What the heck is the matter with @SenCoryGardner ? Can you talk some sense into him? He is shaming the people of #Colorado
Keep fighting! We have your back!
Then be part of the solution. Step up!  Easy to obstruct and criticize!
JFC, what do you think the @GOP have been doing for the past 8 years? Could've worked on a real plan but just obstructed & obstructed.
Thank you! I wish our other Senator @SenCoryGardner had the same level of integrity as you!
and what health care plan do you have? ever been on Obamacare? thought not, even leaders in the democratic party admit it needs tweaking
Thank you!
Thank you @SenBennetCO for representing #Coloradans with ethics and morals
Thank you Senator!
Our representatives need to come up with a healthcare plan that insures affordable and reasonably priced coverage for all Americans
Happy one of our senators has some sense.  Thank you!
#ThankYou
Thank you @SenBennetCO for standing up for Colorado! #copolitics
You say they have insurance, but can they really afford to use it with outrageous deductibles and copay a.

Keep fighting! Thank you, Senator!
You keep fighting with all you've got & we'll keep calling, emailing, faxing & tweeting! Lives are at stake!! 
Now, vote YES to #MedicareForAll. Private insurance continues to fail in keeping Americans healthy.
Thank you Senator.
Thank you for continuing to fight, Senator.
Thank you for all you do for the people of Colorado and the US.
Thank you @SenBennetCO !
Thank You Senator Bennet!!  Keep Fighting for Bipartisan solutions...Would be good to form Healthcare Coalition to assist Congress.

Thanks!
Thank You for working tirelessly for CO.
Thank you for listening to us.
TY Job Well Done...

You voted no because republicans voted yes
Do you believe your open Drabble?
Thank you so much, sir! Wish @SenCoryGardner would also vote no.
Thank you senator. Too bad your colleague @SenCoryGardner is working for Mitch instead of his constituents.
Bennett worked for obama now schumer
And @CoryGardner voted for it! What a disgrace to Colorado he is. Thank you for you NO vote!
Thank for keeping our most vulnerable citizens in mind. #SaveMedicaid #Save #NoCutsNoCaps
Easy vote. Strange some other members actually voted for dumpster legislative language.
Thank you.  You apparently are our smart Senator!
Thank you for your commitment to the well-being of Coloradans. You are one of the candles in this dark time #hope
Thank you for your vote. @SenCoryGardner we will remember how you voted.
Can you maybe talk to Cory? See if HE can also vote no?
Thank you! @SenCoryGardner this is what representation looks like. 12/3/20
*11/3/20
Please do something about Cory. He's hiding from us. HELP !

Terrorizing Americans. Do Senators know human behavior well enough to predict backlash from this?
Thank you. Keep up the good fight.
Proud to be your constituent! Thank you !
Thank you, Senator. If you see @SenCoryGardner today will you call him a coward and kick him in the balls?

Thank you for working for all of us in Colorado!
It's so relieving to have a senator who actually cares about Coloradans, since that neanderthal @SenCoryGardner sure doesn't.
Gardner absolutely does NOT care about anything other than his $$$$.
Thank you, Senator B.
Are you no longer quoting your #FakeNews 22M?  More like 5M!  Less than 2% of all #Legal Americans!
Thank you @SenBennetCO! We are lucky to have one Senator in #CO who cares about real people
Thank you Michael for standing up for everyone. Stay strong
Thank you, Senator Bennet!
Thank you, Senator Bennet!! We appreciate your efforts to protect those of us w/ pre-existing conditions, Medicaid, & other #health needs!
Thank you Senator. We are with you.
Keep fighting!! We need you!!
