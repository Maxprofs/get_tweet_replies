Gardner is not gonna change his vote. He's an dedicated misanthrope.
Keep fighting for us !!!
Dems AND GOP-you owe us voters a bi-partisan bill. Less Cost. Many choices. Fix it for citizens-no political football!
Sen Bennet- you get this!  Dem colleagues & Most constituents get this. Greedy don't WANT TO- all but them- not deserve
You are a fool Senator. You willingly mislead by saying healthcare. This isn't healthcare, this is for access to insurance. No single payer
well if @GovofCO would work on healthcare then we wouldn't need to worry about the whims of the self serving senate
Listen WH (45) listen.
Where's Cory Gardner? He refused to state his stand on healthcare vote. Then, we found out he voted to repeal ACA.
@IndivisibleNOCO @greeleyindivis got ur back @SenBennetCO. Taking to the streets today to make our voices heard. Won't go down w/o a fight.
So Very Proud of you Senator Bennet!  Keep Swinging because you are spot on!  Thank You for putting #PeopleFirst
The look on your face sort of breaks my heart. I can see your care & worry. You are doing a great job Senator. TY for sticking up for my son
Actually they are repealing the leftist, failing #healthcare bill you passed 7 years ago.
Thanks MFB.Please do what you can to thwart the efforts of those who would cut Medicare. After that, support single-payer!
With all due respect, sir, everyone keeps telling me that, but @SenCoryGardner is completely unavailable to constituents.
Apparently his office doesn't even track constituent concerns. Do I have that right @kejtia?
Unfortunately, I wish I could say I was shocked to read that...
Thank you @SenBennetCO keep up the fervor and keep strong.
So. Very. True.
#ProtectOurcare
Thanks4standing up for people like my son and myself. We are both on SSI..NEED HOME Can't afford1. Any info on HOPEprogram? We live by you.
Thanks for bringing me HC policy that costs me $30k a year before I even see a Dr...priceless...thanks dip wad!
Don't people understand recipients are medical providers. Only used when individual has a claim. Not a monthly benefit.
Get rid of the ACA! Affordable is far from a proper description!
you @SenBennetCO !
I love our Colorado Democratic Senator @SenBennetCO 
Proud to have shook your hand and voted for you, Sen. Bennet. Give the GOP hell!
ThankYou4Caring about people like my son,Noah B4 11y.o, He had 2,2hip, gallbladder, 8+G.I. EyeSurg Lots ofinGr8ful4MedicaidThank You
We need Universal Health Care! No man, woman or child left behind! No one should have to choose between bankruptcy or life saving treatment.
Give them Hell Senator!
Relentless... indeed. Gonna fix the mess you all created. #MAGA
Bennet, carpet bagger set up in Colorado by way of Washington helped pass the outrageous failure that is Obamacare & needs to stop preaching
Jimmy Stewart left you a message; said you're not pointing enough and need to look sweatier & more pained. #YoureNoMrSmithSir
You voted for th current mess. We should listen to you why?
Did your mother teach you to lie like that?
LIAR & Democrats are waking up to DNC frauds like you
Proud to have Sen.Bennet represent CO. Thank you for raising your voice on healthcare.
Thank you, @SenBennetCO. I'm calling @SenCoryGardner daily.
Thank you Senator!
Thank you for standing up for Coloradans who need Medicaid.
Thank you for fighting for us @SenCoryGardner could learn how to be a human from you.
@SenCoryGardner Keep fighting Michael!  We're behind & support you! GOP will go down in 2018, but we must block them every day until then!
Thank you @SenBennetCO for your powerful statements, your visible support, and your personal commitment to this fight. #motivation
Keep fighting Sen. Thank you We need you Has @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP forgotten #2018MidTerms? #ProtectOurCare We are watching every vote
Thank you senator Bennet. Let's not forget adults with developmental disabilities who rely on Medicaid in order to live in communities.
They hear. They just don't care.
Thx @SenBennetCO. @realdonaldtrump, @SenCoryGardner & @SenateGOP don't have alternative. They're just playing politics with people's lives
#Coloradocorycare  7years in the making, where's Cory?
So proud of one of my Senators. Doing what right for Colorado. Small biz owners need access to exchanges 4 insurance.
Thank you Senator Bennet, but unfortunately it seems like our junior senator has rather selective hearing.
I'm always tweeting @SenCoryGardner and demanding a no vote.

This is my other senator that I rarely mention. He's fighting for Coloradans!
It will make little difference when the government shuts down in 1 month
Promote yourself much? 
Please remember people living with disabilities as a vulnerable group in need of Medicaid. #SaveMedicaid #NoCutsNoCaps
Thank you Senator. Adding my voice daily too bad @SenCoryGardner and his staff won't pick up the phone. Glad we can't count on you to fight
See, if it wasn't for the Trump diasaster, I wouldn't even know that I have an awesome Senator
Thank you, Sir for standing up for Coloradans & our healthcare! Please keep fighting the GOP members who want to kill us for tax cuts!
Love your voice,  but as a leader, what do you want us to do?
#Activate Phone calls, emails, petitions, req town halls. Get @SenCoryGardner to listen to constituents rather than bending to @GOP party.
Thank you Sen Bennet! Don't know where you get the energy.
Thank you sir. It's nice to have 1 senator working for Colorado. Where is @SenCoryGardner ??? Meeting with the Koch bros, no doubt.
Thank w
If you can influence @corygardner, that would be great. He is lost.
Thank you @senbennetCO for your leadership & support of Americans. @SenateGOP : You people are just wrong. NO NO NO to your fake bill. Shame
oh Mikey I have told you to go away countless times and its like you don't listen to me.
Tell them, Mike!  And ask them how many jobs my brittle diabetic dil should work to be able to afford her insulin and insurance!  Five? Ten?
If you take away Medicare and increase premiums, it will be a total disaster for the people who need it most.
Thanks for standing up for CO. Good to see you find your voice.
As a new resident (1 year) of Colorado, I'm proud to have you as my senator.  Thank you for fighting for ALL of us.
Thank You!  It would be nice if @SenCoryGardner cared as much as you do.
Thank you senator Bennet.

Please tell @sencorygardner to answer his damn phone for once or hold a town hall so he can hear us!
Gardner's not answering his phone for the rabble in 2017. Only the Kochs.
Put our needs above the insurance/pharma lobbyists- push single payer!
Thank @SenBennetCO
Thank you senator. Good to know that Colorado has at least one senator looking out for Coloradans
I'll be voting for you as soon as i can mr bennet.
Now's the time for Dems to counter inane, brutal GOP plans with the only plan that makes sense: Single Payer. #SinglePayer NOW
God doesn't like ugly. This dude should be careful.
Thanks!  Fight on!
Since when did you care about our voices?
Can you pass a message on to @SenCoryGardner for me since he doesn't answer his phone? Tell him VOTE NO for me, would ya?
Blah....blah.....blah........
Can you talk to .@SenCoryGardner and ask why he won't hold town hall meetings? When will YOU have another one, btw?
