thank you for standing up for our kids and refusing to confirm DeVos. @SenCoryGardner, please reconsider - she's unqualified.
Thank you for fighting for us! It's a shame your co-senator sold our children out for $50k.#GardnerForSale
200 mil she paid to get her hands on our kids. #justsayno #noDevos
Devos fined $5.3 million dollar for violating election law in Ohio and has NEVER paid it? WHY is she allowed to be nominee?
