Thank you!! Can you try and convince @SenCoryGardner to vote against her too?!
thank you! As an educator of 30 years, I appreciate that your decisions are informed by your constituents!

of course you are, you guys are going to oppose the whole way through-regardless. You'll hate POTUS SCOTUS pick too coming soon

Thank you for using common sense in this era!!!!  Your constituents will be relieved to know this!
Thank you, Senator.
thank you!

Can you loan @SenCoryGardner the $50,000 he took so he can also vote NO on #devos? #notpaid #independent #taxpayer #80113
Thank you, Senator! Please also vote against Sessions! We need your voice!
I'm less worried about Bennet on these votes. It's Gardner that we need to pressure.
Careful, that's bullying language. Speaking of elementary school, aren't we above that?
The people in Durango appreciate your vote against DeVos.
Thank you Senator Bennet!
Thank you for standing up for CO schools. We appreciate you! #copolitics
doing what his party wants, not what Colorado wants. Expected. #Notmysenator
thank you. Sad that Gardner does not think for himself
I disagree, system is broke, hire someone to fix it!
Thank you for this! Please talk to @SenCoryGardner - he needs to do the same. #Education is not a partisan issue.
why can't @SenCoryGardner  make wise decisions too? Please remind him to side with the residents of Colorado.
thank you
I'm on of your constituents. Thank you for standing up for our children,  and in turn our future leaders. You are appreciated.

Thank you for putting the best interests of Colorado children first!

Thank you. Please work to get other senators to join you.
and I've seen nothing that inspires any confidence from you.  Bought and paid for cheap suit
YEs! Thank u
PLEASE CONVINCE SEN GARDNER TO DO THE SAME. impossible to reach his office. I'm originally from MI. De Vos is a HORRIBLE choice
THANK YOU!
Glad to hear it, otherwise you'd be getting a call from me just like Senator Gardner is!
thank you!
thank you for making an educated,  thoughtful decision.
thank you for your opposition
Good job Senator! She is completely unqualified and destructive to Public Education. Thank you!
And the NEA and ED have done such a great job for 30 years.  Dept of Ed costs $2K per child every yr.  For what?
Been calling to ask you to do this, but have only been able to leave messages. Will continue for future issues. Thank you.
THANK YOU on behalf of our children
Stand strong in your opposition to DeVos. She is not good for all our children.  continue to talk with your fellow senators
we need school vouchers.Approve Devos.
You owe us your constituents  to be cooperative  with the POTUS! Stop boycotting & discipline the rioters! Annoying!
Do not vote for DeVos. She is grossly unqualified for the position. Thank you!
so you are going to show up and vote no? You must of not got the memo from the union and your twits in charge to stay away.
you make me proud to be a new CO resident #NoonDeVos
@Dave02658272 thanks for the retweet.  Senator Bennett is a warrior for CO!

Thank you!
NO on DeVos.  Please encourage your Republican colleagues to prevent her from destroying public education.

This is good.  Continue to stand up and resist this Fascist regime.
Thank you again Sen Bennet. I'm sure you are in a difficult environment. #DeVosvote

As one of your constituents, I am grateful that you are keeping our children in your thoughts when you vote.  Thank you!
I agree.
please vote against Sessions! And the restructuring of the NSC and Bannon's place on it!
thank you Senator! @SenCoryGardner, can we count on you too?? She would be terrible for Colorado's children!
Was glad to see the "no" vote on Tillerson as well.
Thank you, Senator!
But, but, @BetsyDeVos will have her first job after 40 years of being lazy. Lazy isn't good on resume.
Thank you! @SenBennetCO
Good for you! Hope you can persuade at least one more senator to vote no.

Thank You!

thank you!
thank you.
Thank you for voting against Betsy DeVos.
Thank you Senator for opposing this completely unqualified candidate.
I just wanted to say thank you for standing up for the children in CO and the US. Keep fighting for us!
We are so glad you recognize her utter lack of qualifications and also her experience in Michigan was a total failure.
We appreciat having a Senator who actually looks at the truth not Alternative Facts and will oppose a pay for play nominee
Thank You for voting to make America smart again.  The rampant ignorance and willingness to listen to LIES has created a crisis
Thank You so much it is time to dig in.  The majority supports you.
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/826470807274668034 â€¦ (Ranked 1st for Jan 31.)
thank you Senator.
Thank you!
what are you plans for Scott Pruitt, Jeff Sessions, Rex Tillerson, and Niel Gorsuch?
why was she the only one you voted against? You have failed any supporters of this party and 3rd party will be the future vote
THANK YOU SENATOR!!  BOYCOTT ALL TRUMP NOMINEE!!
I agree
thank you.  At least Colorado has one senator we can count on.  #downwithgardner
Thanks!  Will you please talk @SenCoryGardner into doing the same?
.@SenBennetCO And please please vote against Sessions and Tillerson!
Thank you, Senator Bennet! Our students deserve better. -a Denver constituent/parent
Thank you for this!  And the boycott of the Finance Committee. It means everything in the long term.
Thank you for standing up for The public education system.
please reconsider we must stop the Common Core mess and need new eyes on our children.
Thankyou thankyou thankyou!!! With decisions like that, CO's got your back! Keep fighting!
Thank you for opposing the confirmation of Betsy DeVos. SHe is not an advocate for public education, essential to a democracy
Like always, we disagree! You do not represent the people of Colorado or of our nation. You are like a thorn in my foot!
thank you for the no on DeVos & your good vetting. Can you get any Rs to cross aisle?
.@SenBennetCO Thank you for committing to a "no" vote on DeVos.  She's truly a bad choice  for Colorado.
As a Colorado voter I did not vote for you to be the resistance party., but to work together to solve problems.
And will you provide Gorsuch the same courtesies that Republicans provided Garland?
My Grandson has autism & relies on Spec.Ed to progress in life. DeVos is extremely under qualified, & our kids deserve the best
Thank you for standing up against this incompetent nominee!
Now vote against nominee #noGorsuchscotus
excellent!
thank you. As a non paid protesting Coloradan I'm looking for integrity from my senators. (Hint hint @CoryGardner hint hint)
move education back to the states!
Thank you, from a constituent.
what do you think is the right decision on school choice?  CO has a lot of charter schools for you to be against.
thank you Senator Bennet!  Proud you are representing Colorado in DC!  Keep up the good fight!  #leadresponsibly
Thank you, Sen. Bennet!
Again, thank you Senator!
Thank you for looking out for our kids.
Thank you! Please also vote no on Sessions!
 Thank you for fighting for us!
I voted against you too.  You gave me less confidence after your first term and not much into 2nd term.
Thank you @SenBennetCO & I hope you convince other senators to stand with you against a bad candidate
Thank you.
drain the swamp...  next election
Hello, understatement much! And that's for voting for real education.
thank you!
thank you so much
Thank you, Senator! Please vote against Sessions! He does not belong anywhere near the White House!
Thank you! Happy to have you as my senator.
As you should. She's proved not to be in clear understanding of the position nor does she have a clear direction. Bravo!
Thank you!
can you convince that jerk Gardner to do the same?
Thank you Senator. Your willingness to seek the best qualified candidate is appreciated. Politics aside get the best person
.@SenBennetCO thank you. You gave it your best. Keep fighting the good fight.

- thanks for listening to your constituents on Betsy DeVos
.@SenBennetCO thank you for voting #NoOnDeVos! You have my support!
As a Colorado citizen this disappoints me. I think that she is terrific and will help our childrenâ€™s education system well.
thanks for knowing where to take a stand, wise decision!
Queen of buy down chits. In Colorado, Ad Valor High stipends.
as one of your CO constituents, I thank you for standing up for our best interests.
