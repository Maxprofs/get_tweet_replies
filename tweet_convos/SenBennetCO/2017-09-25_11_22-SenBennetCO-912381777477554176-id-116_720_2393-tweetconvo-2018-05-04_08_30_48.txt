Was that before the Republicans had them removed?
Those are the same domestic terrorists who disrupt town halls, occupy wall street occupy Gardner's office...and you celebrate them? #SAD
Domestic terrorists?? Did you miss seeing the many obviously disabled people and their caregivers standing in line? What's wrong with you!?
.....and that gives them a license to disrupt the process.....and to occupy, illegally, Gardners office in Denver?They are not above the law
Nobody should be above the law. But to label fellow Americans as terrorists is truly closed-minded and cold-hearted.
I'll concede your point that my label was extreme.That said I believe that those who disrupted the hearing were there only to obstruct
Thank you. As a disabled woman, I appreciate that there were others who did attend because I couldn't. We usually have no voice.
Nice to see an elected official take the time to show that people matter. Thanks Senator Bennet
Thank U so much 4 your hard work &dedication 2your constituents, especially non wealthy ones, by keeping with fight 4Obamacare! I voted 4U

The plan needs to cost less cover everyone and expand the primary care workforce. All other OECD countries do it with a universal system
@SenateMajLdr had these good people arrested - time for Mitch to be repealed & replaced
Keep listening, but also act, sponsor and propose Democratic ideals. Return to Roosevelt...
Thank you Senator Bennet for speaking out against this horrible bill.
@SenBennetCO so glad you are a compassionate tune in representative for our state. Plz @SenCoryGardner we hope you will vote NO on G-C.
You are listening but apparently 49 Republicans don't give a damn about the rest of us
And so many more of us would be there in line, in person if possible.  Thank you for recognizing all of us voicing our opinions to keep ACA.
That took courage most of our representatives can't muster. People are scared & angry,  rightfully so. Thank you, Senator Bennet.
Thank you!!
Thank you for all you are doing.  80123
Pres Chump why don't you just disappear
THANK YOU SENATOR BENNET
Thank you senator your man. Remember  you work for us not Chump
You listen but what about the GOP Senators...
Disgusting Bennet that you honor these domestic terrorists!They don't want to participate in the process! They want #STOP the process #USUCK
Disgusting that you legitimize these domestic terrorists who shortly after your high 5's were disrupting your committee meeting #ScrewUMike
Thank you!!! I think the @GOP is scared of their constituents.
Thank you @SenBennetCO for steadfastly opposing attempts to strip healthcare from the citizens of Colorado!
Great point about @realDonaldTrump promising no cuts to Medicaid - Medicare and now trying to pass this Assidy - Grabham bill.
Thank you.  Raised in CO, living in SC. 
Do what's right for our country. No to Graham-Cassidy.
Thank you Senator Bennet! Things like this make me proud you're my Senator! Please speak with your colleague @SenCoryGardner!
You are listening to lefty LOONS. Why not listen to me. Repeal and Replace
Thank you Senator for not ignoring people .
Gonna help pay the bail of @NationalADAPT protestors that were arrested or nah?

@SenCoryGardner This is what a real Senator does don't you wish you could be like Senator Bennet
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you Senator Bennet.
So happy to see all the people!
Unfortunately, their voices will fall on the deaf ears of Republicans looking to line their pockets with Koch money.
 thanks! I appreciate you @SenBennetCO & believe that you're governing with the people of CO in mind & the  
What will @SenateDems do to prevent a vote on #GCHJ? Rolling dice by allowing @SenateGOP to bribe, vote, only need to stop business 5 days.
I hope that @SenateDems leadership @SenSchumer @SenKamalaHarris @ChrisMurphyCT @SenBernie are ready to use rules to delay vote past 9/30
But they're getting removedby Cap police.
To bad many are being escorted out or blocked.
Maybe you and they will learn something about the free market.
Thank you for going and talking to the American people..too bad there are some who cannot be arsed  Now got kill the bill
Thank you Senator.
Often we despair, feel we are not heard or seen.
Being real to people who are not direct constituents, means the world.
Thank YOU for your caring, listening, and being an instrument for change in Colorado and the US. Bravo, Senator Bennet, Bravo!
Thank you Senator @SenBennetCO.  Too bad @SenCoryGardner is so blindly loyal to party that he simply does not care about CO.  You are a hero
thank you for your passionate questioning! we need a bipartisan bill to improve healthcare, not #GrahamCassidy
Thank you for calling it right.
And then Orrin Hatch had them arrested. The right are nothing but fascists. Can't stand the people speaking out against an atrocious bill.
Vote no! Expose the bill as the shit tag it is for when Trump poop tweets.
#RegularOrder is NEEDED
Looks like they’ll get arrested, too
Thank you Senator Bennet!!!
Your "I object" to @PatRoberts had me ROFL.  He was so pissed off. Hilarious. #GrahamCassidy #WaysToPissOffRepublicans
@Al_Drago This doesn't look like the same line...hmmmm.
Well @SenBennetCO is listening the GOP seem unable to
It's not that the GOP is unable to listen, it's that they don't care about anyone but themselves and their cult on administration. 
What a great  Senator Colorado has. Thank you Senator Bennet for fighting for our healthcare.
Please please stay strong and help @SenCoryGardner do the right thing for US in CO...
Thank u sen Bennett. You have long supported the ppl of co and we appreciate it. Co stands to lose billions. Sen Gardner doesn't care
You always treat people well and work with us in mind. I met you and you were kind and civic minded. Keep working hard, and thank you!
Where r the rest of d congress? Get out there and stand with the peopl
Thank you @SenBennetCO!  @SenCoryGardner this is What Colorado wants.
Screw you mike aka @SenBennetCO You are not listening to everyone! Only the libs who want more free stuff! You Dems screwed up healthcare!
Thanks for fighting @SenBennetCO and all the @NationalADAPT heroes!!!
Thank you senator—I wish your colleague @SenCoryGardner would find some moral courage and #saveACA and Medicaid expansion

Bill Cassidy is literally yawning as protestors are carried away. 
Thank you for fighting for families like mine and for Coloradans. For us protections for preexisting conditions is personal. Keep fighting.
And this?
You can see pain & confusion on faces of many of the Capitol police officers dragging screaming/crying ppl in wheelchairs against their will
Thank you Senator Bennet!
Every single one in line should have to explain the bill they oppose. Fully.
OMG!!! Goosebumps!!!
Please make sure ALL Americans can have healthcare!
Are ya! Who's being removed then?
You are listening, and thank you. Not sure about some of your colleagues.
Thank you for caring, Senator Bennett.

Thank you, Senator, for fighting for Colorado. I'm so thankful that you're my senator

Relative deprivation - if GOP Takes affordable healthcare away - (?)
