the left is the one making the unsubstantiated claims. Maybe you need to get educated
What about Clinton secret meeting with AG? This is all party politics not supporting me your voter. Do your job now
Could you please forward this to @SenCoryGardner - he hasn't heard the news yet. I would but he won't answer my calls.
We are tired of T#45's Fake Claims. This is not a reality show! It is cold reality for America!
Thank You sir for your leadership. Tenacity & fight are required to get to the truth. Coloradans are behind you!
Thank you for standing up for the people of Colorado and America.
Thank you Senator Bennet!
Thank you @SenBennetCO for taking a hard stance. You are more presidential for it.
Time to stop party politics and support the president I and millions of others voted for. Lets vote you and dems out now
Continue to insist on a thorough investigation into the Russian ties with Trump and the sycophants surrounding him!
I know two people who don't want that to happen.
thank you. I hope @SenCoryGardner & @RepTipton will join you in standing up for our country
Senator Bennet will stand up for Colorado!
Thank you. I think it's important to note that this is no longer left vs right, it's heading toward national crisis. In 80129
.@SenBennetCO How about a statement on @POTUS gutting CO-based space research & aerospace industries by huge funding cut to @NOAASatellites?
Yes please Sir.
past wrongs are going to get people burned in this issue!
Thank you Senator, appreciate your leadership. Keep the fight up & know we have your back.
@ReSister2016 please know 45 has reached delusional state of authoritarianship. Nation must have protection agst true 45 danger
Thank you for representing CO with this rational statement. What about you @SenCoryGardner?
He is missing in action and won't face Coloradans!
Where is your 'clear evidence' ?
Thank You
Right on go for it have my support
Thank you for this!
@kaydubj @POTUS lol. You said integrity and democratic institutions in the same sentence.
Hey, criticize your own senators. ;) (BTW, @CoryGardner is a tool.) @SenBennetCO @POTUS
too easy
IMHO, @realDonaldTrump owes @POTUS44 a public apology
we need to know the truth, please push for special prosecutor and full investigation.  Thank you.
Oh - by the way.  We won't forget that you voted to confirm John Kelly and thus tacitly supported ICE raids.
Hell yes!
Thank you, Sen. Bennet!
Thank you once again. Please continue to challenge him.
Thank you for your support of a special prosecutor and listening to your constituents on the Trump-Russia issue.
Thank you senator Bennet! We are counting on you! aren't there any patriots on the other side you can bring along?
Unsubstantiated claims? Sounds like you & the Dems on Russia. Where's the evidence & smoking gun? #desperate
I agree with you on potus but you sold us out for campaign cash when you voted down Canadian rx drugs. that was bribery
Thank you Senator Bennett.  Continue to push for a special prosecutor.  80209
@POTUSBumblephuq @POTUS Ty Senator, I am truly afraid of where we are headed, like a train wreck we can only watch and cringe.
I'm with you, Sen. Bennet.  Well said, sir.
Thank you for this. Please continue to fight back against the insanity coming from #POTUS45UNHINGED
you are so right! Keep fighting for us.
@SenCoryGardner We see who stands up and tries to save the US and world.  Thank you Sen Bennet!
@SenCoryGardner Sen Bennet rocks!
just like Chuckie Schumer told you to write it mike!
@indivisibleden @POTUS Special prosecutor! Not a paid tweeter. 80227
well said. Thank you!
Thank you, I support your actions.
Should investigate Trump as Dems did Teddy K when he asked Russians to interfere w/1984 elections. Hypocrisy's finest.
Thank you, thank you! @SenCoryGardner THIS is how it's done!!
Sen Bennet keep the pressure on for a special prosecutor to fully investigate Russian connections,no distractions.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
keep up the good work Representing your state, Senator. Gardner-recall you represent a blue state now. Adjust!
intel committees say they'll look into it. What other ravings of potus will they chase after next?
@All100Senators @POTUS thank you. We need to get to the bottom of this
Thank you, Senator! We need more representatives like you, on both sides of the aisle.
get to it! Pronto! Chop chop!
I must have missed your statements calling for investigations of HRC private server, Benghazi, IRS targeting, etc #Get2Work
Thank you for inserting logic and sanity into this latest insane claim of Mr. Trump.
thank you senator Bennet.
Mr. Bennet, I asked b4. Now I am begging. Get rid of this idiot This might be how 3rd world countries do it, but NOT USA
Do we maintain the moral high ground or is it time to start yelling "LOCK HIM UP? #25thAmendment
I'm grateful you continue to respond rationally to the insanity that is coming from the White House. @SenBennetCO @POTUS
Very glad to have you representing us! Thank you. @POTUS is making the case for a #25th Amendment action with every tweet.
TY What @realDonaldTrump said about @BarackObama showed he will do/say anything regardless consequence. Even to @GOP
Thank you, Senator. I agree 100%
Thank you Senator Bennet, Russia is the real issue, distractions like this should be ignored.
Make it happen. Dig in. DJT acts and says things that suggests deeper involvement. Shameful governance. Unfit POTUS!
thank you for your voice!!!
Thank you Senator. We need the truth, one way or the other.
Thank you Senator!
Thank you Senator Bennet! Keep up the fight to get to the truth and we got your back!
Wow, the MoveOn mailing list all showed up to say thanks for the #Fake investigation
you should probably keep this around as a form letter
Michael,u no this Russia BS is BS.Trump is just doing the same 2 the Dems with his tongue in cheek.Dems started FakeNews
thank you! Keep up the fight.
Thank you! Stand tough on this, please. Coloradans are with you.
Thank you! I'm so glad I voted for you.
Trash comes out of DT's mouth!! When are steps going to be made to get rid of this clown??
thank you!  @SenCoryGardner,get on the integrity train, please.  81201
Thank you.  At this point, it feels like we are on a rudderless ship and we need to resolve this and move forward.
Thank you for continuing to focus on th Russian connection w/ our elections. Time to convince Gardner to do same.
thank you for representing the people of CO
meanwhile @SenCoryGardner continues to pretend like all the things the President is doing are normal.
You. You are Colorado. Thank you. We support you.
Thank you, Sen Bennet, from 80304. #persist
Have you talked to @SenCoryGardner ? 
Is he believing @realDonaldTrump Tweets?
Appreciate and fully support this. When are you going to have a town hall (in person please!)?
Ted Wells on line 1...
well said!
Thank you so much for vigilantly protecting our American institutions.
Thank you Senator for standing up for America! @SenateGOP @HouseGOP #indivisible #resist
Thank you @SenBennetCO
FBI Said to Have ‘Granted FISA Warrant’ To Wiretap TRUMP Tower.  That is pretty substantial isn't it liar..
Yet you still are a shill for the False Russia narrative against AG Sessions all this time and still nothing.
thank you, Senator. Please do everything in your power to move forward an independent investigation.
.@SenBennetCO Thank you! Please urge your fellow Colorado Senators, @SenCoryGardner to follow suit!
don't forget about the 26th amendment.
Thank you Senator Bennet
Thank you! @SenCoryGardner Where is your rep of CO?? This so-called Pres doesn't rep CO values!
Thank you, Senator. This constituent fully backs your stance. 
And 'bizarre' was the perfect word choice!
Thank you Senator Bennett! Colorado is a great state.
Sen Bennet, I hope you can convince those that are in charge of this.Americans are just full of dread & anxiety. #russia
thank you, well said!
Thank you Senator Bennet! @SenateDems and please continue to push for a special prosecutor to investigate Russian ties
absolutely!  How unpresidential to make these unfounded allegations. Let's get to the bottom of the Russian connections.
Potus is clearly unfit, possibly deranged. GOP seems willing to let him flail while they ram their agenda through. Stop them.
thanks Mr Bennet. I wish @SenCoryGardner would do the right thing as well. Country before party, please.
Gardner is a one term Senator!
2nd
thank you senator Bennet for taking a stand for facts and against lies
and tying to an investigation of something we KNOW happened.Insult to Americans.He isn't serious-please con't doing this
thank you!
keep it up Senator.This is beyond concerning.Calling for taxpayer $ to be spent based on conspiracy/partisan news??
thank you for this strong statement. Will @SenCoryGardner work with you on this? I hope so
as always on matters related to 45, phone town hall Cory quiet til told how to not respond
Will you support a mental health evaluation for the @POTUS? His repeated bizarre and paranoid claims are terrifying.
thank you, Senator Bennet for standing up for sanity!
thank you!!!!! Thank you so much for having a backbone and standing up to this nonsense
.@SenBennetCO @POTUS the most disturbing in this case is the likely counterpart requested by #Russia in exchange for its "good" services
Thank you. We need truth and sincere leaders at present - glad CO has at least one senator dedicated to America.
Thank you! As a fellow American I'm sure @SenCoryGardner joins you in this regard.
Yes Senator those are the words we need to hear. Bravo!
This president needs a psych evaluation from a reputed doctor. We are seriously concerned about his mental stability.
I FULLY support this!!!!!
thank you
