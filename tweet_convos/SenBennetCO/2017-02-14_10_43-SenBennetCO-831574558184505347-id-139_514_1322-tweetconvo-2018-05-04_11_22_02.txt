Paging @SenCoryGardner. This is what it looks like. Take note. @SenBennetCO. #copolitics
.@iansilverii @SenCoryGardner @SenBennetCO Careful with your glass houses there, Ian. Where's Bennet's statement on Shulkin? #copolitics
.@COpeakpolitics...that he was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate? #copolitics
THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO TRUMP. NOW LET's GET HIM OUT! For PUTIN/TREASON or using Ammendment 25. TRUMP IS MENTALLY ILL.
Need 9/11 type commission, bipartisan known, experienced respected, members with gravitas. Must be serious, beyond reproach.
See previous tweet.  Intel leaks is the elephant in the room that you won't mention.  It also puts us at risk. Must stop!
Thank You Sir!! We need an independent special counsel as well. Sessions can't be trusted.
Session said he won't recuse himself. Deserves a 9-11 type commission, bipartisan, experience with gravitas.
drive for an inquiry!
Yes! Please!
.@SenBennetCO Thank you for your leadership! .@SenCoryGardner where is your statement? #FlynnInvestigation
vote no on guns bill
this is why Dems say NO to anything this group wants to do. Stand up for the people that need you.
Thanks Senator Bennet.  I agree!  A #FlynnInvestigation needs to be bi-partisan, and it needs to be now!
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/831574558184505347 â€¦ (Ranked 1st for Feb 14.)
Thank you, Senator Bennet! Glad I voted and canvassed for you.
totally agree. Do you think you might be able to get that other senator from Colorado to actually do something?
Absolutely!!! This is too flagrant to sweep under the rug. #Resist
I agree we must get to the bottom of whether or not sanctions were discussed with Russia.  But Intel leaks must also stop!
*tap tap tap* Is this thing on, are you seeing this @SenCoryGardner? This is what leadership looks like.
Please make this happen
thank you
Thank you! GOP who won't investigate should be under suspicion themselves.  Russia has data on the GOP #TreasonousTrump #russia
yes!! Please keep advocating for this! THANK YOU!
Absolutely -- thank you for your leadership. It's time to convene a bipartisan Senate select committee on Trump-Russia ties.
Thank you for your courage, sir!
They're going to find that Trump is up to his gonads in this! It's not about leaks! It's about who did the crimes that leaked!
@mswettwalker @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner 
What did Obama know about Hillary's illegal and unsecured server?
I prefer not to dwell on the past!
I disagree.  Only 32% of the public trust the press to be unbiased.  Not functional
Thanks, agreed re: bipartisan #Investigatetrump needed immediately.
Persist. Please do not let this go. Thanks Senator Bennet!
Thank you! I fully support this action. @CoryGardner this issue is above party politics. Please do the right thing - 80026.
I agree. Please continue to push
Thankful that one of our Colorado senators believes in doing the right thing.
#ThankYou!!  Please guide @CoryGardner to #dotherightthing
let's do that when you ask for an investigation of Hillary and her emails that were stolen and shared.
Thank you! Keep pushing until we get it!
yea you!
and no comment from @SenCoryGardner... not holding my breath... Gardner shames all Coloradans. #onetermandout
Thank u! Keep pushing, keep fighting. Our democracy truly hangs in the balance!
PUSH THIS SEN , THE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THIS LYING PILE OF CRIMINALS , CALLED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY .
Great! I'm pleased to read this today. Thank you?
thank you! Our security is more at risk now than every, not just because of Flynn.
tytyty
Thank you Senator! We appreciate you.
thank you for your support. Maybe you can talk some sense into @SenCoryGardner
you didnt care when Hillary facilitated 20% uranium sale to Russia
#lockhimup
thank you for standing up for what's right!
THANK YOU! 80304
yes! And the American people demand it! #Investigate
Thank you for pursuing the truth so that we can restore our faith in the American value of truth.
yes! Thank you senator. Get some answers. #FlynnResignation
Senator Bennet you've always had my support, including volunteering on campaigns.  Please keep fighting for us
need full investigation of when Trump knew about the hacking
Agreed.  Please push on this.  Most critical issue now.
why?
Well, get it done Dems. It sounds like GOP has you all on a short leash and muzzled. All I hear is bark, bark!
Are you paying attention @SenCoryGardner? This is how the whole "representing your constituents" thing works.
Thank you, Senator!
Yes, thank you, Senator Bennet!
Thank you
Thank You
hey @senrobportman your colleague is right. 3 resignations from Trump's team due to issues w Russia+no tax returns. Smoke=fire
agree I'll keep tweeting this: remember Nixon and his administration, I do, I regret voting for him, vowed never accept lies
How can we make that happen? Zip 80127
I am fully behind your efforts for a full investigation.  What did POTUS know and how long?  Is this another cover-up?
Just like you did on the @HillaryClinton email server scandal? #hypocrite
Please push for this. I know Republicans are fighting it tooth & nail.They fear Trump's involvement & don't want him out.#Flynn
@HappyFeminist yes please!!!
thank you, senator. I can't wait to vote for you again and help you with reelection. @CoryGardner, not so much.
this is why I voted for you!!!!
thank you Senator Bennet for holding these clowns accountable!
wonderful! Care to follow suit @SenCoryGardner?
yes!!!
Thank you, Senator. We're counting on you to stand strong!
@mswettwalker @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner 
What did Obama know about Hillary's illegal and unsecured server?
Thank you!
When are you going to address our $20 trillion dollar debt and protect US citizens from criminal illegal immigration?
You wouldn't know bipartisan if it fell to earth and landed at your feet.
Senator,
Where is your balance?  You represent a purple state not a blue state.  Why didn't you call to investigate the IRS?
Thank You.
what say you @SenCoryGardner ?? Do you want to protect Colorado citizens & fellow Americans??
Thank. Please keep the pressure up.
Agreed!  Keep fighting that corruption!
finally!! And @SenCoryGardner too busy getting 'paid' by the @GOP  - you'll need it 2020 - represent CO for a change!!!
thank you
Thank you for putting our country's security first. This shouldn't be a partisan issue--I'm looking at you @SenCoryGardner.
Thank you, @SenBennetCO !!!!
thank you.
You mean like they did for things like Fast and Furious, IRS targeting, DoS illegal email servers? Just shut up.
Thank you for this. Question: will you start speaking out in person when you hear 45 malign fellow senators? #LetHerSpeak
Thank you, @SenBennetCO. Please remind the Junior Senator @SenCoryGardner of his obligations.
How do we get the Republicans to investigate? I think we all need to know if the WH is for us or Russia, seems reasonable to me
@mswettwalker @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner 
What did Obama know about Hillary's illegal and unsecured server?
Not even close to relevant,  I'd say nice try but it wasn't even that.
It definitely is relevant.  Natioanl security was put at risk.
Keep pushing on, Senator. @SenBennetCO
This is only week 4 and the fun is just starting! Let the good time roll! Should prepare for a new presidential innauguration
yes
I'm so glad I voted for you! Go get them before they do any more damage.
thank you. Hopefully @SenCoryGardner will join you in standing up for our National security
What did Obama know about Hillary's illegal and unsecured server?
thank you for your work. Keep pressing. Never give up.
thank you! Keep up the good work. @SenCoryGardner take note.
thank you,  @SenCoryGardner needs to put country before party and join you. #onetermgardner
Please assist @SenCoryGardner in recognizing the same. A foreign government was involved in the election! Who is getting paid??
Thank you for doing the RIGHT THING!!! Too bad @SenCoryGardner is lost in the woods with the @GOP
Thank-you @SenBennetCO. Keep up the good work!
Thank you for asking for an investigation! #resist
@AllLeftNews but I really wish they would fight and not run 
thank you again for showing the world that true Coloradans know how to stand up for what is right.
keep it up!  We all need you. Rely on you and @RepPerlmutter to represent CO!  Need to get @SenCoryGardner on board!
Thank you, Sen. Bennet! I campaigned for you in 2010 and I won't forget your courage!
Be careful what you wish for.
Bullsh*t
Where were you for Benghazi, Clinton Foundation Scandals, Hillary Brokering Selling Uranium to Russia?  Hypocrite!
Exactly!
That would be at the least a sign of being responsible...
KEEP PUSHING SEN , THE PEOPLE ARE BEHIND YOU .
Exactly. @JohnMcCain meets with #ISIS Prison is gaping.
I'm wondering if your investigation will include why the conversation was taped before his appt. and leaked to the press.
Thank you Senator for you statement and your service on behalf of ALL americans.  Faith in government must be restored.
yep more gotcha busy work so each @DemSenators get 15 more min air time.i already tune out @SenSchumerWhine over exposed
I see @SenBennetCO has sent us a Valentine. 
The #FlynnResignation is not enough. Congress must start a full, in-depth, bipartisan investigation immediately. 
I wish he was my Senator.  I liked his campaign ads.
Thank you! See @SenCoryGardner, doing the right thing isn't that hard. Give it a try.
Thank you @SenBennetCO! Keep demanding this - 80210 here.
you are such a tool. Where was this sudden "backbone" during the Terrorist-in-Chief's (0bama) years???
Have you and CO colleague, @SenCoryGardner, been able to talk about this issue? What can you do together?  80866 #WhereIsCory
thanks for all you hard work! Can you get our junior senator @SenCoryGardner on board as well!
thank you Senator Bennett! We're counting on you to keep the safety and best interest of the American people front & center
into the leaks from the Obama admin.
keep it up!!
thank you!
