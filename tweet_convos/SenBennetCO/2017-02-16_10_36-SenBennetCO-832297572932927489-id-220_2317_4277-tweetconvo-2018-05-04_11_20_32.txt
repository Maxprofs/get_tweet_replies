How would you know Michael?The last time your office called me, they thought South Fork, CO was on the eastern plains.
Tuned to the key of b-flat minor.
"Well oiled machine"... Fake 'news' from FOX & Friends? INDEPENDENT FACT CHECKERS: FOX 'news' = 60% FAKE NEWS
Mike: this was the one item that made me laugh during the whole horrid presser.
Way too funny
@RepDianaDeGette stop virtue signaling and help @POTUS get to work bringing jobs back and #MAGA3X
@sarahyankovich lol, how true! I can't stop laughing...

It's a feature, not a bug.
you are sooo right Sen Bennet!
that administration is full of crap!! 
wouldn't you really like to know
Frankly some levity in this bizarro world in which we live is welcome. DJT's blatant lying is unprofessional.
Really. So this is what my reps in DC are up to. Middle school slanders? You embarrass me
@Michael23921465 @POTUS that's funny!
this is something a 16 year old boy would post. Thought you were a professional adult...that why I voted for you..whoops
haha
maybe you should help instead of making negative comments

Here's another "fine-tuned machine."  @Hererathnot143 @POTUS https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F76%2Fab%2Fd9%2F76abd9aa85d89cd53c5297129ea57cee.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Ftigergrrl14%2Ftitanic%2F&docid=3Tler12YDuHR7M&tbnid=JFLPnPtUqxy6hM%3A&vet=1&w=600&h=322&client=safari&bih=672&biw=1024&q=titanic&ved=0ahUKEwje-u7y_JXSAhUGMSYKHd0qCwoQMwh2KAwwDA&iact=mrc&uact=8 …
The most we have heard from the senator since he called Peter Boyles show,or an  intern has taken over his acct.MNL...
Cory Gardner hasn't shown his face in years
Like one of those Samsung washers.
@MicaylaAMilne @POTUS Yeah, right, said the jackass.
- I think Phil Dunphy repaired it.
@SenateDems you mean like an endless Rube Goldberg machine?
Sen Bennett, please post this video and your statement on Facebook; it will be circulated more widely.
Your gif reminds me of Obamacare.
I'm happy to call you my senator today. 
Riiiight...
@SenateDems @POTUS u should know ran one for 8 yrs.lmao
@deejay90192 @POTUS well said! Ty! CO voter from 80022
@joanse @POTUS Yep.
@SenateDems @POTUS love it
@EconCharlie @POTUS  Funny!!!!
@SenateDems #shutdown DC till all the dirty laundry is aired out!!! ;)
even the most fine-tuned machines will break down and malfunction if you throw something that doesn't belong in there.
@tbooker1 Yesssss
@SenateDems @POTUS your racist. You used a white washing machine. HOW DARE U?
@SenateDems @POTUS @VP @PressSec Wrong!! Because I see Rants/Protests by Liberals...BUT WITH NO CHANGE at All like Pres Trump!!
@serenityatsea @POTUS thank you for that laugh
'Get em J-5'
Did you learn anything from the election? Making fun of Trump and his supporters will not help heal the Country.
@RoguePOTUSStaff Is this what fine-tuned looks like? Guess you would know.
Thanks, Senator!
sounds like the hamsters in #45's head are working overtime again
i don't he knows what his statement means.
@SenateDems @POTUS that's funny!!
And my fave "Blowing up and leaking radiation in all directions." :-D
I like the analogies found in science fiction. "Leaking like a machine-gunned water tank."
@djbratpack @POTUS Bawhahahaha
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump yup smooth! @Impeach_D_Trump
@SenateDems @POTUS Best tweet ever!
I laughed with fear that this its true
You know we can all see and read fine tuned machine like the one above
"Welcome to... the machine..."
@SenBennetCO @antonnewcombe @POTUS
THAT LOOKS  ABOUT RIGHT!!!
LOL
Why do you hate the American people in middle America?
@SenateDems @POTUS Obviously a Trump-brand washer. Like other Trump products, made in a sweatshop overseas #FakePresident
@samantharonson the wheels are falling off of the short bus.
@SenateDems @POTUS at least it still has power.
love your sense of humor! @POTUS this is what your admin looks like from this side of the podium.
@SenateDems @POTUS  
@SenateDems @POTUS rube Goldberg machine?
.@SenBennetCO @SenateDems I'm a tinkerer & love restoring old machines; this one looks like a prime candidate! DON'T INSULT OLD MACHINES!
@SenateDems @POTUS   And to make things worse the laundry comes out dirtier than when it went in!
Sounds like the Dems R just a little green w/envy! Try as U may 2 screw up this Pres. - it just wont work!
@SenateDems @POTUS Couldn't have described it any better.
thanks so much for that! best laugh I've had all day
this is the #Democrat idea of a fine run machine? Explains quite a bit
@SenateDems or like this beauty I spotted outside the WH on Wed. Customary gold &  mileage.
I saw one of those & other junk lining the road in a nature area in OK. Please vote no on Pruitt.  Don’t let him trash CO
that looks more like the senate! have a nice vacation obstructionists azzhats.
@SenateDems @POTUS lmaooo
"I'm not ranting and raving!"
 -@POTUS, while ranting and raving
@SenateDems @POTUS WAY to pull our country together big guy. Very mature!
It is like you ignored the long list of things accomplished so far. Read the transcript of the presser.
LOLOL Too funny! Thank you Senator.
@SenateDems @POTUS ok this really made me LOL!! 
so that means the storm will be nuclear???

NAILED IT #RESIST
the SHADE.
@GCMYoungDems @POTUS  
Good one, Senator! :) Aurora, Co.
my favorite tweet. Ever.
. @SenBennetCO @POTUS so true. Please call for impeachment. I'm a Colorado native, I voted for you Michael Bennet (not 45). #ImpeachTrump
Love this picture!
Sen Bennet wins the day.  
Here's an idea: stop mocking, be a statesman and help solve problems Sen Bennet.
 this is amazing
Good one!
good one!!
@CitizenKayS @POTUS 
It was a bizarre spectacle.  He is unhinged!
CO did not elect you to be a comedian. Get to work for Coloradoans #MAGA #repealandreplace #taxreform
Lighten up. Republican.
@Omundson @POTUS that's an insult to the appliance that, I might add, has some sweet moves!
this is incredible
Sen. Bennett wins the Internet for today. #TrumpPressConference
How many representatives will demand a proper independent investigation into #putingate #russianhacking #russiagate ?
My only regret is that I have but one retweet to give.
good one,  Senator! Thank you for your leadership.
PLEASE take action. This cannot continue.
 this!!!!!!! Way to go Senator

It's a mess. He didn't inherit it he made it.
Great depiction of the "fine-tuned machine"!
Looks more like the Dems 2016 campaign. Can't wait until 2018.
The fact you are trolling him is enough to earn my vote again for you.  NOW, make sure you keep the pressure on--NO SCOTUS appt
. @SenBennetCO @POTUS how do we make this finely tuned machine stop?
pointing out flaws does no one any good; let's be part of a solution not watch it fall apart
There is a man with a great sense of humor!!!
Bahahahahaha!! #PresidentLoco
Thank you Senator! This CO constituent is grateful to have you represent us!
That's about right.

Oh I like you! Someone actually made me laugh after that, that "mess". Thank you!


Please keep up the good work, Senator.  We all need you and your wisdom to push back against this insanity.
Thanks for this.
love  from Colorado !!!
Why not work with this administration to do something positive for your constituents here in Colorado? What a shame.
@SenCoryGardner We've lost our little buddy Cory. You haven't seen the little spudling have you?
Hahaaahah you rock, Senator!
Awesome!!!
Lay off the hash, chief.
That's the funniest thing I've seen in a long time!
That is some grade A shade right there!
Dang, Senator - you've just tweeted my favorite tweet of all tweets!
Till the wheels come off.
 Thanks for representing CO
The shade is 
LOVE.
nicely done!
@mbeezy514 Just watching 45 confess his campaign officials conferred with Russian intelligence while "not ranting and raving"
Dead. #YesMySenator
@AltUSPressSec "Fine Tuned machine"

He is delusional!!Chaos is unacceptable - but expected - with unqualified, inexperienced lack of leadership
BOOM
lol CO is laughing every day at @POTUS
This performance art is unbelievable.

Trump is finally cracking because he's lost his mind along time ago!!!
So True. He is so unfit to be President, I wish more people would have listen to Hillary.
@InSpiteOfTrump @POTUS lol
