@brendagaylern It actually marks a recurrence of refugee treatment during the late 30's We cannot let this stand. #NeverAgain
And during the Carter, Clinton, and Obama years......
Do you want to provide proof or are you just talking out your Ass?

So you are neglecting to acknowledge key differences. It's not that hard to do, try.
What a bitter person.  Nothing is exactly the same.
Bitter. How about honest ? How about fact driven? It's not hard. Try it.
Why you Dems lost.  Blame and divide.  Not discuss differences without name calling.
Thank you for speaking out against the #MuslimBan Senator!
You DO realize not every Muslim is a terrorist, right, Melissa? How do you have so much hate in your heart?
Orlando was carried out by a US citizen. Enjoy your alternative facts.
And a ban on Muslims entering the US is going to stop that how? Be gone with your racist rhetoric.
thank you.  Please keep fighting this xenophobic nationalist.
Any time you want to belong to another nation go for it.
no thanks! Disagreements and diversity are the point of this nation. I'm not going anywhere.
Strange. You mention the points of the nation but you don't like a nationalist. You only like nationalists that agree with you?
nope I'm not a nationalist at all. Look up the actual definition. I believe in the Nation that is the US. I'm no xenophobe.
Please withhold consent on Senate business until the ban has been lifted and filibuster any bill that comes to the floor.
strange how u didn't mention that the violence throughout the Middle East was the result of Obama's support for terrorists.

Can you explain to me why taking in refugees make my family safer? Why don't you get us some jobs like @realDonaldTrump does?

Are there any congressional republicans who will stand up against this?
saddened this is happening in our country
