The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?
Yes, I agree. Thank you. @SenCoryGardner please join in this effort as well. We are not trusting our leadership right now.
Agreed! This situation is not good!
where were you when Clinton had secret meetings with the AG???? Who is investigating the leaks in the WH? Voting you out soon.
sir, it's time to stop doing the nations work until we, the people,re assured that our country and our security are not at risk
Good job.  Hold their feet to the fire!  Colorado proud of you for standing up for what is right.
Thank you Senator Bennet!
@realDonaldTrump The patriots leaking information on TRAITORS in the WH isn't the problem, the executive branch TRAITORS are.
-(2/2) of the United States of America. This is TREASON!! Do something to protect citizens in Colorado for a change.
thank you!
I appreciate this statement, but statements alone don't count for much - we want actions! #TrumpKnew #fightgop #russians
I
The time has come to began the impeachment process before the country is harmed any further.
Never heard you calling for a bipartisan investigation for Loretta Lynch secret meeting with Bill Clinton a little hypocritical
Here is bi-partisan investigation: investigate why Hillary/Obama sold 20% OUR uranium to Russia. @POTUS
Agreed, don't let Trump deflect and try to change the subject.
Don't let this go, we're paying attention.
Now you are worried about national security???? Where have you been the last 8 years?  This happened on your watch.
AGREE!! Distraction is a TOOL of Trump et al.  PLEASE do ALL YOU CAN to PUSH for an IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION into Russian Intel.
Yes! This is needed ASAP and we are counting on all of you to PUSH for it. - from 80129
time for you to lead the way back to normalcy, Senator Bennet!
@CowardCoffman Questions growing how deep GOP is in Russian interference in election with their silence.
Thank-you!  Please push hard for a full investigation of Flynn and Russian connection.
Yes. Keep aiming for truth.
I am SO RELIEVED to read your Tweet.  Our NAT'L SECURITY IS AT RISK due to Trump's meetings w/Russian Intelligence! PLEASE PUSH
@realDonaldTrump Imagine if this stuff had happened under Obama. Impeachment hearings would already be underway.
(1/2) I agree.An investigation into the purposeful leak of classified info for the overthrow of the President and government
To protect our country, we need an independent, bipartisan & transparent investigation into Trump Admin & campaign - NOW!!!
agreed!!!
thank you! @SenCoryGardner come on dude!
The story is what is a Russian ship doing on CT shores and why the silence about it?
An independent 9-11 commission with power to indict is required. There is no trust in partisan politicians right now.
You do not represent my values as a CO res or American. I am ashamed I voted for you. you R part of the hypocritical minority
thank you. Please do everything in your power to investigate and remove DJT's entire administration ASAP!
And yet Trump felt fine about openly discussing Korea with the Japanese Prime Minister in his Mir-a-Logo restaurant.
dude holds security meetings at restaurant tables, so I'm guessing leaks will continue.
I agree.  Thank you for your vigilance. We must hold our POTUS responsible also
maybe you should ask Mike Flynn what the real deal is 
Thank You
THANK YOU for standing up for us. Please be relentless.
How about a debate between you and Gardner on this and a couple of other issues.  Have it here in CO.  This is an opportunity.
Thank you Senator Bennet.  I'm a constituent (80513) and I trust you will keep pushing for this.  We need answers!
Thank you for your rep. Please push for select bipartisan investigative committee on Russsian involvement in admin & election.
Thank you Senator. Please let @SenCoryGardner know Colorado is behind you in investigating #SCROTUS and his administration.
THIS IS THE ISSUE NOW:  "What did the President know & when did he know it?"  National Security over Politics  
@RoyBlunt  #GOP
these "leaks" Trump is TWEETING about are diversions. They are part of the strategy!
thank you for backing the people of CO and doing what's right. @SenCoryGardner should take notice.
well said!
You are a coward and hypocrite part of the establishment representing the press and rich elite not representing working class
Thank you for your hard work, I am proud I voted for you to represent Colorado.
thank you!
Yes, Sen Bennet! Glad you said it. Starting to see US in very dangerous waters.  National security should be top priority now!
get em' Mike. Don't let these clowns sink our country in the name of kissing the Trump ring #resist #noquarter
Thank you for your leadership on this!!
We totally agree: GOP Leadership needs to step up & start a bipartisan, in-depth investigation now. Listen Up @SenCoryGardner
Thank you Senator
Thank you for focusing on this.
you have my support 100%. Thank you for your leadership.  Keep it up.
any chance of getting @CoryGardner to stop playing party politics and do his job based on constituency.
- Absolutely!  It's way past time for the GOP to be the check!
Don't let up! We appreciate you!
thank you, Senator Bennet. @katsudonburi
it will never happen. Only thing they have to offer is, voter fraud and paid protester comments. And, repeal ACA.
Flynn, Campaign Staff, Trump's taxes, all before select committee, UNDER OATH!
the ties to Russia is what needs to be investigated and acted on. 3 advisors step down in a month for Russia ties! WTF?
@SenCoryGardner  Absolutely!! We're behind you Sen Bennet! Sen Gardner needs to step up.
thank you for speaking up. @SenCoryGardner what do you have to say? Or are you just blindly party loyal?
Stop complaining and lead the investigation!  Real heroes put it on the line.  Are you a hero or a zero?
Thank You
You just need to convince folks like @SenCoryGardner of that. I've already called and done my part.
I agree, investigate Trump, Pense, Putin and the fake election! It all stinks.
What do you want to investigate? Change has many enemies and change is coming to DC. Dems stop obstructing. @POTUS
Thank you for your integrity. Our nation is at risk.Please keep fighting.
@realDonaldTrump senator your silence was deafening's on there Iran deal so you have no standing
Thank you for representing Colorado. Don't back down from this blatant attempt from the other side to cover up wrong doings.
Please take action yourself instead of calling on GOP leadership to do it.
Where were when a senior adviser to Obama could not get a security clearance? Partisan hack you are
Agreed. Love how @POTUS is trying to change the subject. Stay on him. We have your back Senator.
thank you for pushing this point. Flynn would not have acted alone on such a serious matter.
Plz continue to be vigilant and diligent in following this very real threat. Follow the trail back to origin. Flynn not alone
@NancyPelosi @SenSchumer I find Democrats opposing Trump on everything more of security risk than the Russians.  @POTUS
Much like Republicans opposing Obama on EVERYTHING FOR 8 YEARS?  Hypocritical
Yes Partially, at least Obama had his cabinet in place at this time.
Seems like they are just using his bizarre behavior to deflect from their destroying America with detrimental bills. #congress
Exactly, let's put on our big boy pants and start working with President Trump. Pick the right battles.
do not rest until ALL is known!
clearly people do not trust this administration. Hold them accountable!
of the current administrations continued Russian dealings.
Republicans are demanding we "Move on". It falls to Democrats to protect the Republic. Please do not fail us now.
Thank you,  @SenBennetCO please organize your colleagues to take action on this issue
Why is the president watching so much Fox and then tweeting?  Doesn't he have more important things to do?
@realDonaldTrump the question is did trump have Russia help him win in exchange for no sanctions?How much $trump get from them?
Thank you!  Keep the pressure on!  Russian connection is far deeper than will ever be known.
Thank you Senator Bennet! You just saved me a call to your office asking you to push for an investigation.
Yes. Every day that @GOP chooses their agenda over the country, their hypocrisy looks more like corruption.
there is no way Flynn acted in a vacuum on this.  This must be investigated!
Please make this happen Senator Bennet.  Young David Farenthold is after Goliath all by himself
@SenCoryGardner -- please join @SenBennetCO because our nation's security supersedes partisan politics and Americans deserve the truth.
Glad at least ONE of our CO senators cares about the citizens of his state and country.  Where are you @SenCoryGardner ?
@realDonaldTrump Please be sure to hold them accountable to be sure this investigation happens Senator Bennet!
thank you Senator. Please keep after this.
Thanks. If  @SenateGOP @HouseGOP had balls to stand for America instead of for #Trumprussia we'd be safe from @realDonaldTrump
thank you
thanks for standing up and not going full @SenCoryGardner on us! Keep up the good work!
Please lead a charge!
I am CO native...where are you on the news demanding this? We are at risk and we must #impeachtrump
Chaffetz just declined to do so. McCain's statement makes no mention of further investigation.
