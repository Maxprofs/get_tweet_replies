Thank You Senator Bennet. zip 81233
Thank you from Colorado!
...agreed. They've waited 16 yrs already.  #Devos  YES
thank you for listening to your constituents
YOU are WRONG and a disgrace to Colorado. Children first, NOT teachers unions. Glad you lost. Now REAL education will prevail.
Thank you!
Thanks for standing up for education policy unlike @SenCoryGardner who sold out children for #GOP politics. #PeopleOverParties
did you and your kids not attend private schools?
Seems you are voting against all Trump nominees. Not fair or right!!
get better nominees then?
when all are rejected, then Bennet not giving any the benefit of the doubt???  Not truly representing all CO!!
thank you! Can't wait to vote out @SenCoryGardner  so after 2020 we have two Senators actually representing CO voters
We will see now that Marijuana is legal in CA
Thank you Senator.  Appreciate your thoroughness and vote.
thank you
Changes need to happen, for the better, NOW. Our children are failing, our good teachers are leaving. Our Future is at Stake.
Thank you for standing up for Coloradans
Thanks for voting against her and listening to your constituents.
Well done, Sen. Bennet. I will remember this when I re-elect you!
I emigrated in 2002 from the U.K. and Detroit public schools have been bad since i arrived. You have done nothing to help yet!!
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you for trying so hard for us Senator. We appreciate you.
thank you from your constituents in Denver
thank you!
You and your daughter both attended elite private schools. Why weren't public schools good enough? @SenBennetCO
I'm #NoOnDeVos because our young people cannot afford to wait four years for their chance at the American Dream. 
@KevinNR @SenBennetCO I don't get it...you mean you think it's wrong that he attended a private school?
Thank you, Senator! See if you can get @SenCoryGardner to see the light as well, please! :)
LOL!  This guy's kids attended private school!  This is such hypocrisy.
Thank you for the NO vote.
@SenCoryGardner it's easy to do the right thing. Thank you.
Considering you and your daughter both attended public school, it’s pretty bigoted working so hard to keep the poor out.
.@SenBennetCO Thank you for voting no on DeVos. #NoonDeVos #imnotpaid #notmypresident
I am fed up with manipulation, lies, fascist, dictatorship perpetrated by Trump, Bannon, Flynn and corrupt team/cabinet - stop!
I'm NO on Bennet. I'll be voting against you. I'm anti Democrat.  Shame inn You!
Bravo! Thank you for standing with the people of Colorado.
Thank you for your vote against DeVos. Please oppose Sessions, too, and any attempt to sell Colorado's wildlands. @SenBennetCO
Know: "never attended public school..and Colorado’s Sen. Michael Bennet." http://dailysignal.com/2017/01/09/senate-dems-set-to-scrutinize-trumps-ed-secretary-pick-attended-private-schools/ … @SenBennetCO PolElites aim: keep ppl dumb!
Thank you for voting NO on Devos and speaking against her. We won't forget
If you see Cory Gardiner, tell him I am not paid by anyone to oppose De Voss. She is unqualified. Thank you for seeing that.
Where did you and your daughter go?  It rhymes with livate.
thank you for voting against DeVos. Please step up & read Coretta Scott King, since McConnell won't #letlizspeak . Please.
Thank you. Please keep on keeping on; we need you in CO. @SenCoryGardner has abandoned us for bribes. #Resist #HearUsCory
@CoryGardner What happened to our other Colorado Senator? Oh wait, he got thousands of dollars from DeVoss.
Thank you Senator Bennet for taking a stand on the right candidate to protect our younger generations!
Thank you for standing up for what's right. Unlike @SenCoryGardner, you actually represent Coloradans & our values.
thx for voting against one of T's billionaire nominees. I agree that she is not qualified.
thank you for voting no
Thank you for supporting our children, Senator! I wish Senator Gardner would've had the courage to have done the same.
Thank you for standing up for Colorado. If our other senator had your conviction, we'd have sent her packing.
Well done, Senator.  80223
someone worse up because it's irrelevant. We have seen the types of nominees he puts up. Now the DNC needs to show spine!!!
even if you lose the filibuster it doesn't matter. Stop thinking that you have to vote on a Biff nominee because he could put
the democratic party loses it's about principle. You must show that theft will not be rewarded and that you are fighting for us
Vote no on all Trump nominees! Don't think about trying to negotiate because he nor his party care to and never did! Even if
thank you for voting for education! I'm proud you are my senator
thank you senator bennet for fighting for my son... and every Colorado kid.

Please do the same on the rest of his horrible nominees...and not I am not a paid protestor
Thank you for all you are doing to fight for us and our children. Please keep up the hard work!

thank you for standing tall!
thank you for voting #noOnDeVos.
thank you!!
great job, I expected nothing less. I will vote for you again.
Marco Rubio what is it only $100,000 you got bought we will remember money talks right
kind of proves the point it's money talks you have no convictions for anything else except money shame on you Rubio
Pure demogauary.  You say you are pro choice?  Let the single mom in chicago have the same choice the Obama's have in schools!
thank you for being the one CO senator who listened!!
.@SenBennetCO The right vote for the right cause. Sadly, GOP lacked the integrity to find even one more vote. Pence and his rubber stamp.
THANK YOU Senator. We need more people like you in our Congress. Sad to see that @SenCoryGardner is exactly the OPPOSITE of you
Get serious and work with others to accomplish something.
Thank you for doing what's right!
thank you for voting #NoonDeVos -please don't quit doing what's right.
Thank you for your work on DeVos nomination. Apparently $200million buys you a Cabinet nomination. Even if you're unqualified
Thank you for voicing our concerns!  The right to an excellent education is what makes America great!
you did your job but the other tool box decided how much his vote was worth
thank you for making the right choice.
thank you Senator Bennet.
Thank you for voting no. It is a sad day for education.

Thank you senator! @SenCoryGardner needs to follow your example.

you need to get Cory on board- or his time in Washington will be limited.
Thank you.

You talking about Taxpayers being forced to provide an education for people here illegally? Not surprised you're Pro-criminal.
