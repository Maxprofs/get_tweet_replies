Big diff between legal immigration and uncontrolled borders. 1st obligation of Federal Government is to protect US citizens.

Thanks 4 saying this. Go to DIA & make a stand. Sincerely, a voter from Highlands Ranch #NoBanNoWall #RefugeesWelcome
that's a nice sentiment, but a weak response to a bigoted, authoritarian & "unAmerican" action by our federal administration.
Thank you @SenBennetCO!
Post-WW2, mother/grandparents came to US, the 1 country they thought could rebuild their shattered lives. And they did. #immigrantexcellence

THANK YOU
Please follow with immediate legislation on Monday to block this absurd executive order. #standwithrefugees
