If only Darryl Glenn had been elected, Colorado would have a proper voice in Washington. This is embarrassing.
Yeah, how dare @SenBennetCO stand up for gun victims, clean air, POC. 
What a terrible person.....
No one said he was a terrible person. He’s not “standing up for gun victims.” He’s pandering to his party’s base. Darryl Glenn IS a POC.
Didnt DG support Trump?
Yes. How is that relevant? Not everyone in Colorado wanted another Clinton presidency.
No one who helped install America's Sun King gets my support. 
And at least Clinton was literate. 
Flawed, sure - dictator, no.
If you believe President Trump is a dictator, I feel sorry for you. I want everyone to be comfortable and happy so that we can do better.
Appreciate your sentiment, but DJT is clearly dictatorial in thought, word, and deed. He admires and emulates them, and rails at constraint.
I am sure all you #LiberaTards #BLM #AntifaTerrorists @DNC out there will argue with this.
Senator, thank you. Sound gun control legislation is the most desperately important issue, out of so many, we are facing. Pls keep leading.
What would you consider “Sound gun control legislation?” More restriction of “assault” weapons or more background checks? Interested.
Mass shootings are not the price of freedom.  They are the price for politicians bought by the NRA who do not care about public safety.
2nd amendment. It’s by definition a right and a part of freedom
#subtledifference
XD now the left wants to get rid of rights. Authoritarians show their true colors
Highlighting the subtle distinction between 'a right' and 'right'. Eg, in the US police have a right to stop and search.
But is it right that Blacks, Native Americans and Hispanics had higher stop/arrest rates per head than whites, non-Hispanics and Asians.
You can join the group of morons, how about all the gun deaths on Chicago,  with all the gun laws
Bennett also has a answer but does nothing.   Obama and now schumers sheep
.@SenBennetCO powerfully expresses the sadness & shame so many of us feel at the failure of Congress to address gun violence. #copolitics
Heard someone say mass shootings are “price of freedom.” What a shame—what a surrender that represents to our kids & victims of these crimes 
Hypocrite Bennet voted multiple times with Republicans to expand gun access;
Including on Amtrak; Banned after 9/11.

What moron said that. No murder justifies freedom.
We voted for you to go pass laws. Do your job, please.
O'Reilly of course.
You hang around with some pretty screwed up people  What say you start promoting mental health instead of bitching. Do your job!!!!!
Would you feel that way if it was your loved ones taking cover and crying on the pavement? No. No you wouldn't. No one should.
No mass shooting has a price it brings debt and refusal to aknowlege the problem and suffering is always hard time to stand and fight@bereal
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/916044874901868544 … (Ranked 1st for Oct 5.)
It’s time. The unwillingness of our congressional leaders to take action on gun control is a dark stain on our nation.
You heard who say??? Please....
Freedom IS NOT FREE !  GUNS Insure Anericans Freedom from Socialist Communists like you from Destroying America!  Read History!
Hypocrite Bennet has voted w/ Republicans multiple times expanding gun access
Including loaded carry in Nat'l Parks.

Bill O'Reilly said it - the man has no moral compass.
It's heartbreaking to see what our nation has become.
In it, not of it! 
Part and parcel of living with guns I guess #TwistingATweet
It was bill "starved for attention" o'reilly
Wasting time working on a problem that no law will ever solve. Bad people do bad things. #sad
It's appalling
If people want guns, do as the founding fathers intended: give them muskets.
All you haters of the NRA #2a & the Constitution. The shooter was one of you. A liberal Democrat. Not a Republican, not an NRA Member.

Great speech about why you get to say what type guns Americans can have. This is why we have 2nd. Amendment. We are citizens not subjects.
Thank goodness for you Senator Bennet!
That is unacceptable. Nobody should have the right to cause that much harm. What about my rights to simply live without fear of being shot?
Never happen if you get rid of our guns, buy one and learn how to use it to protect all Americans
Senator, what if I told you that government employees were behind the shootings? They are using psyops & narcisisstic abuse in Colorado.
The shooters are like Charles Manson's puppets or flying monkeys from the wizard of OZ. They don't know why afterward.??

DEEP STATE LIBERAL!!!

"SHOOTER" IN VEGAS WORKED FOR GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN 1993 at Goddard Space Flight Center in…

Well said sir.
Thank you
Dems cry DO SOMETHING, but what?  Enhanced back ground checks which the the LV shooting would have likely passed. Registration? Ban? What?
Stop demonizing people who disagree w you politically on subject of "gun control."  We already have a lot, some of which is NOT enforced.
Says the man who voted against cheaper medicine and is the pocket of big pharma.
Thank you, Senator Bennet. Well said.
Keep fighting Senator Bennet. Fight for gun control, healthcare, environment and other concerns many of us share.
Thank you Senator for giving voice to what so many of us feel & for being a voice of morality, clarity, leadership and reason #GunContolNow

Thank you for speaking out and fighting for common sense, decency, and an America where we feel safe to pursue life, liberty, happiness. 
You can say that it was Bill O'Reilly who said L.V. killings were "price of freedom". Warped logic.
Colorado is proud to have you as our Senator
Don't we have the freedom to go about our business without getting shot?  #perversion of 2nd amendment
We should NEVER settle for that excuse. All of us who support common sense gun control shouldn't be forced to live like this to please NRA!
AGREE. How does no longer feeling safe to attend concerts, clubs, movies, or school contribute to "freedom"?
So gross to defend a mass-murderer's freedom, but not the freedom of innocent people to assemble and express themselves without being shot.
No one is defending a mass murderer.  But you all want the innocent to be mass punished.  Touché
"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
So desecrating the rights of hundreds of millions based on the actions of a handful of lunatics is a good idea?
Thank you Senator Bennett!!! Bravo!!! 
You can't legislate evil away.Dems&Libs NEVER pass an opportunity to sale gun control. Even if it has been definitively proven not to work.
Why don't you consider becoming a law enforcement officer, that way you can do something about it?
If we enforce the laws we have, and make the penalties  harsher, crime will drop. Stop coddling the bad people. Capitol punishment works.
Laws have never stopped or slowed crime.
Thank you for working for the freedom to not be shot. We shouldn't be beholden to a lunatic fringe with a "red dawn" fantasy
No such thing, unless you want to move to North Korea.
#livesoverNRA
#GunControlNow!!
Gun control means using both hands
1 &2A supporter, but no prob getting rid of devices that create illegal machine guns, but with internet & hardware store, most could make.
How are they wrong?
If you don't want the freedom , go try and be a Senator in another country .. Just to let you know , You will not take away our 2nd amendment, if you try American will come forth and stop you .. that's what a free country !
Benjamin Franklin:: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
1/2 Benjamin Franklin also said upon being asked what form govt had been chosen, "a republic if you can keep it."
Thank you
Liberals opinions worth more than others INALIENABLE RIGHTS? Chicago Proves Gun Control don't work. Automatic weapons are illegal already.
Then why are Conservative's opinions worth more than other's inalienable rights?
What part of Inalienable don't you understand? Or is it the whole Constitution you don't understand?Opinion has nothing to do with it.
We're supposed to care about your gun rights, but you want to tell others what bathrooms they can use?  Or workplace right not to get fired?
??? What are you talking about??? Bathrooms???
I'm referring to transgender rights.
I thought we were talking about the 2nd amendment?
Yeh.   Republicans traditionally want their gun rights but they're happy to pass legislation that takes away the rights of Others.
Thank you Senator for your reason on this issue.
Automatic weapons did not exist when these rights were conceived. No citizen needs an automatic weapon, or a silencer.
They did want the people to have the most updated firearms availible.  That is what they needed. They wanted it as a right 4ever!
Funny how many other nations have freedom and do not have gun massacres, how do they do that?? We need to emulate their winning strategy!!
i saw a post mention people in Chicago still become victims because they cannot legally obtain firearms because of the cost, regs, etc..
Gang members fighting it out with other gang members, how do more guns for unaffiliated parties help that situation? It wouldn't.
Honest law abiding people get caught in the crossfire, can't defend their own turf.
Give me a meaningful statistic where multiple law abiding citizens made a difference in gun blazing 2 faction fight.
Thank you for continually representing the people of CO! As for @SenCoryGardner vote him out!!
I agree, vote Bennett OUT!
Thank you 
apparently our government & liberals & demorats have no clue what 'ghost guns' are!!..look into it!criminals will always have guns!always!
Thank you!
i like how our government went strait from the guy to attacking 2A & guns!...how about we stay on point where the guy is the focus & why??
australia's asault weapons ban was very effective
i think blaming the gun for decades has proven its not the gun.it is the idiots who want to make guns look bad.& that is where the focus at!
these idiots think they can get their nut job people to do these attacks then use it as their reason to steal a countries rights & guns!nope
mass shooting are price of freedom!taking people's guns in no way makes them safer!why you think countries have armies!morons!!
That somebody was Bill "The sexual harasser" O'Reilly.
so islam not a problem?...blacks & all the crime they do not a problem?...white guy radicalized now there is a problem!?but blame gun tho!!?
Choices are to accept this risk or lose a "right". I dont believe this risk is acceptable. There are limits to other rights, why not 2nd?
No, We the People do not lose a God-Given Right.
God given?
These "rights" are, at their core, a contract btwn ppl and their govt. Govt made by and for its ppl. This is all about ppl.
It was a contract with God
Many other free countries that do not have our rate of gun violence.
Suck one
Thank you Senator.

Meet A Generation That Has Grown Up Free From Mass Shootings
How do you fix it? 83 dead and 400 wouldned in France from a truck.  Are they banning drivers licenses? I agree though, no full auto.
That was the moron @billoreilly  Entirely irresponsible response. People can have guns, just not guns that do this kind of harm.
SD Senator John Thune made very similar comments. In fact, seemed to blame victims for not "getting small."
Wow. Didn’t see that. Its worse from a member of Congress.
Improper use by a few is the price for anything. Hate speech is the price for freedom of speech.
Improper use of a vegamite doesn't results in thousand of death a year.
Thank you for speaking up Senator.
Thank you! #2A people: if you think our most important right in this country is to own a gun, you need your head examined. #gunsafety NOW
What if we think all rights are important and shouldn’t govern ourselves by fear and emotion?
Agree they're all important though personally would rate #1A far above #2a. But who are you saying is governing by fear and emotion?
The 1st Amendment is protected by the 2nd. There is a reason why the right to bear arms is so high on the list.
So #1A only if I have a gun or someone w/ a gun protects it 4 me? Maybe in the late 18thc but in today's civil society not a 1-1correlation.
People with guns have been protecting it for 200 years. You’re welcome.
If you mean the military, OK. But this does not apply in the least to common citizens in civil society in the 21st century.
Quite the shame. Thank you for speaking out eloquently. Hoping Congress can act effectively.
If you want to talk healtchcare and gun controls let's talk, but just control count me out
Senator, that someone was the careless, callous and empathy void @billoreilly . Shame on him.
