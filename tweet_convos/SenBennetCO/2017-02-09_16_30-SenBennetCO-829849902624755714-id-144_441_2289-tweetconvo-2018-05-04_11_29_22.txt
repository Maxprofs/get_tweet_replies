Indeed. Trump's acting like the ban is the only thing that can work. Shows he's in it for division & fear mongering.
What other options are there? I haven't heard any.
maybe you were asleep during 9/11. You have no credibility
are u referring to my Q of jbpscooter?
yes he posted something crazy about lightning strikes kill more than terrorists
I had a nice exchange with him. I think civility goes further than name calling. And I've been called some names.
no substance from him. Yes factual but stuck in ideological high horse he was not truly open. But his other posts were bad. Thanks
what values do you have?  You're representing a state you're not from.  Not our Senator!
more than half of Colorado citizens weren’t born in Colorado. We fuel CO’s economic growth & we vote, neighbor
He represents the interests that placed him in power, not the people of Colorado.
He represents me, my neighbors, my coworkers & my family. If he stops representing me he'll lose my support.
open ur eyes, he was brought here by the globalists and represents their interests.Mayb thats u & ur banker buds?
That’s funny, you typed “the globalists” but I feel like you meant meant to type ((((the globalists))))
9th Circuit is overturned 80% of the time.  Very bad, political court.   Be aware your values are rarely my values.
Thank you for standing up Senator. We need more of our congress to represent our ethics and values. #Indivisible
He is consistent with OUR values.  He won.  Get a clue.  You are the one out of touch!
@CoryBooker @POTUS 9th circuit court is an alt-left joke.  80% of their decisions reviewed by SCOTUS have been overturned.
He's doing what has been done many times. Who went ape shit when Obama banned Cubans?
the same people who lost it over the tragic loss of life in the Bowling Green massacre.
and now Russia has invaded Korea. 
I am pleased too.  Checks and balances.  I don't think the so-called president understands "values," he's bereft of them
wtf are you talking about?  As usual, a trumpet that speaks without clarity or sense.
you are such a dork.
Yes. As there's no justification for his actions, & as he ignored the laws in his ban, he deserved to have it reviewed.
Way to Stand up!
nothing wrong with putting the security of the country first. Those country's are like the MIT's of terrorist training!
He should also stop lying about voter fraud. You know it's a lie & you must call him out on it. #TheTimeIsNow
The poorly drawn EO using Obama's law and chosen countries, THAT ONE?!!
curious what your values are Sen Bennet.
Battle lost but victory will be sweet.
Thank you for finally speaking out. More please!
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/829849902624755714 … (Ranked 1st for Feb 9.)
@CoryBooker you really don't think you will be elected president ever do you? The silent majority will never let that happen!!
Thank you for representing Coloradans.  We know you hear our voices.
OR Judges should start judging the Constitution instead of making Policy.  Which makes you and elections obsolete.
@CoryBooker @POTUS Cory Booker is a low-life black muslime just like Odumbo
@CoryBooker @POTUS #travelban "makes us less safe 2 #ISIS" so 28,000+ bombs dropd by @POTUS44 WS OK? #9thCircuit
#MAGA #LNYHBT
You would. Sorry to call you a Colorado senator. Follow the Constitution and not your ideology.
Our values?  You don't speak for everyone.  Have you ever travelled to the EU? I value my safety & safety of my family.
@CoryBooker @POTUS some polls have more Americans favoring the ban. So isn't he supporting our values. They r what we make them
@corybooker what a china run court system . as use consititution as ass wipe and flush
@CoryBooker @POTUS Here we go again liberal bull crap  ninth circuit court 90% is overturned what a joke will be laughing next
@POTUSWhat do you mean by "our" values? Democrats values? Your values are to give our country, sovereignty, and away to muslims
let's see how pleased you are if just one single of the ones coming in (which increased significantly) will kill just 1.
@CoryBooker @POTUS
@CoryBooker @POTUS
.Our #values? @realDonaldTrump was elected by #WeThePeople not by #ProgressiveLiberalNazi. #Democrats not values of us
9th Circuit ruling not consistent w/ American values, just Lib values.  Get your values in line with American values.
He should but he isn't a politician ALL politicians need to stand up to this guy, ahem @SenCoryGardner repubs AND dems
so Proud, don't back down.  Keep up the fantastic work unlike @SenCoryGardner
@CoryBooker @POTUS thank you Senator
So that's what our values are? Lawlessness, criminality, no rule of law? 
U can keep UR values..America doesn't want 'em @SenBennetCO @POTUS
- The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals just betrayed the American people, tore up the Constitution, spat on it, and laughed.
@CoryBooker @POTUS whose values?  The U.S. is very diverse.
Judges need to stop politicizing from the bench.
thanks for fighting the good fight and sticking up for your constituents.
Well here is a thing. Our US Constitution doesn't apply to other countries or Non-US Citizens
How people can forget so easily to about how Iran had 7 hostages for several years and some had duel citizenship
Another thing is if anyone travels to those terrorist hot spots it is a fly at your own risk
Terrorist can take any person and assume their identity
They're done and you're done. So short sighted!
@CoryBooker @POTUS my father's generation had sat around and allowed courts to run WW2 we would have lost. Middle US remembers
@CoryBooker @POTUS
@CoryBooker @POTUS   Pleased with the ruling of unelected judges who place their political beliefs over matter of law..pathetic
I dont think "our" is appropriate. There is huge division on this. We clearly dont have the same values, majority wins
You are correct.  Everyone can be voted out but 4 yrs seems like a long time
@CoryBooker @POTUS SO Ninth Clown Circuit disregard the Constitution and that is ok? Learn the law Senators you are disgraceful
@pooPU$$ @therealunpre$idented @therealcomradepimp @reCONpottie
@CoryBooker @POTUS nah, he should just quit
@CoryBooker @POTUS "Our" values? Just who do you think you are? You're not me,  you're not even "us". You're an elitist, not me
@CoryBooker @POTUS so the 9th district knows of the security threats to the USA so they know more then POTUS?
@CoryBooker Even crappy GWB would back off if wrong apologize for an error, redraw plan, instead of bucking all the way to end.
YES!  Thanks!
@CoryBooker @POTUS the big Cheeto should just resign.  He's incapable to accomplish the job
he needs to be removed from office. Get all those grifters out of our Whitehouse. You work for us. #DOYOURJOB
Agreed! Thank you. So happy you are our Senator.
@CoryBooker @SenBennetCO @POTUS well said
@CoryBooker @POTUS yes!!!!!
Yeah! Dream On.......
@CoryBooker @POTUS  What's that saying: When Pigs Fly?
you obviously mean your values because our values elected Trump to do just what he's  doing.
@CoryBooker @POTUS you're a sheeple, simple, ignorant, and uninformed
@CoryBooker @POTUS me and @realDonaldTrump know how to attack. Know how to win. Anyone against us are losers.
@CoryBooker @POTUS republican administration needs to rethink order because judges keep striking it down. With cause.
@CoryBooker @POTUS Senator, what is ur plan to keep us safe?
@CoryBooker @POTUS Time to #investigate Russian ties to this administration and the 2016 election #benghazistyle
@CoryBooker @POTUS try more funding for immigration courts clean up the backlog use deportation wisely humanly judiciously
@CoryBooker a real plan would be to educate grateful immigrants and refugees on american values and gain perfect residents
@CoryBooker @POTUS and Gorsuch needs to go on the public record about judicial independence.
@CoryBooker @POTUS funny how no one complained when Obama had a 6 month ban on refugees from Iraq. #hypocriticaldemocracts
lol “poorly drawn”:
pickel 
let me guess; what Dems are in for $600 please?
@CoryBooker @POTUS and stop his tweeting.
Unfortunately Michael, you're part of the problem, along with your fellow anti American politicians. Shame on you!
@CoryBooker @POTUS Values? Greed is all @realDonaldTrump values.  And power, to soothe his #snowflake ego #SnowFlakeInChief
Is he capable of doing so @SenBennetCO @CoryBooker @POTUS
With all his money, you'd think he could hire a 3rd year law student to proofread ...
@CoryBooker @POTUS yes!! This.
this is not a policy ? But rather s constitutional? Of #POTUS authority to set immigration policy! You object 2 policy
separation of powers. Read up on it. We have checks on the executive branch for a reason.
He could work on improving vetting right now, if it was necessary.
I just heard there are threats being made against these justices! Outrageous. I, a CO voter, will stand in front 4 them
Thank you!  If you are outnumbered in DC, keep trying and we'll work through the courts! #winning
please continue to fight for us!
I tweeted basically the same to trump hours ago.
Are current laws on the books consistent with our values? Legislative makes laws, don't push it off to POTUS.The task is yours.
Thank you @SenBennetCO. @POTUS I hope you get a lesson on checks and balances over the weekend.
BEST DAY since the election!  Love our Federal Judges!
.@SenBennetCO @POTUS Trump has no interest "our values".  He's looking to be master of 3 branches of government. Can't go easy on him.
the POTUS was stonewalled for 18 months. He still won in Middle USA. He is only gaining support now! Keep it up!
keep up the great work.  We have your back.
45 won't do that so I will vote and back Dem. because I believe you all will help be our voice.
As usual, the 9th Circuit doesn't follow the constitution, and as usual, it will be overturned again.
Hope he will do so!
for sure!! But he has no obvious values outside of his own self-serving BS. He is the worst. He is the 1%.
Agreed,  thank you!   And please push strongly to investigate Russia ties and tax returns!
wow another snowflake who lives in the abyss of ignorance...hopefully you don't reproduce
Thank you for supporting and representing the people of CO! We appreciate you!!!!
The people of CO are with you @SenBennetCO  Be tough! Fight the WH bully
Couldn't agree more. So wonderful to see Judicial System work. #appealscourt
hear hear!
Thank you so much for standing up to the demagogue who occupies the WH! DJT has no respect for US Constitution/ &.
Stay on it Senator Bennet. Make Colorado proud!
Thank you for your support on this.
Thank you- good suggestion. We are behind you.
. @SenBennetCO don't back down, don't give up. Don't be @SenCoryGardner.
ridiculous when you account for the number of immigrants living in Colorado attempted to join ISIS and thwarted threats.
Thank you for speaking up to the @POTUS  to demand civility.   I wish @SenCoryGardner & @RepTipton would do the same.
the orange guy should be doing many things to be more presidential. Nice to see our government keep him in check.
Proud to call you my Senator
Keep fighting the good fight.  We are behind you 100%.  #filibusterthatshit #resist
what a joke, remember, all the lives are on your shoulders. The people of America will rise and oppose you
If national security is at risk, they should be running to do this, rather than battling in court.
What is it going to take for @GOP to finally make serious inquiry into @POTUS capacity and fitness for the job?
When snowflakes like u come back to earth..was hrc fit for office? Your sophomoric arguments r fun
AGREED!
Afraid that might be asking too much from #cheetolini
Keep finding ways around him!
Failing that, please keep up the good fight.
Colorado is lucky to have you with us, keep it up!
You want him? Would gladly give him to you.
