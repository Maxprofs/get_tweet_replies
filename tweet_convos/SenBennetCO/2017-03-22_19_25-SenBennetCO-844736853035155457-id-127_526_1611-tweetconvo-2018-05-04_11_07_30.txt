Yes please!  As soon as possible.  Majority of America agrees.
And we want to see Trump's taxes.
most definitely. This investigation must go on. Scarey times.
the senate mended to drop the stupid Russia thing and do your job for the people and not your politics.
@CoryGardner Every single action taken by Trump is tainted unless and until there is a full and fair independent investigation.
If there is nothing there then the cloud will be lifted from the Trump administration.  Country before party.
Also more obvious than ever, we cannot allow a #SCOTUS nom from a White House under FBI invest to proceed! #filibustergorusch
Keep fighting for the truth. Keep fighting for Colorado.
Cory Gardner when are you going to confront the truth???  @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner
Yes#Gorsuch No#Trumpcare
thank you
Really?  What to report the obvious at great expense?  Move on, nothing new here!
This "Politics as usual" stuffi is a waste of time and focus,  Confirm Gordash and get on to fixing the tax & immigration plans
start with john podesta
no gorsuch confirmation until then.
Yes AND hold on SCOTUS until resolved. Lifetime appointment by possible illegitimate POTUS. Hold all action
Is Prett Bharara still available? I think he should be the prosecutor.
Sorry, Preet.
conspiracy! what a joke
and we need to say no to Gorsuch. What year is it that we still need to protect basic rights for women.
He should not be allowed to fill the SCOTUS seat, while this is an open issue!
does not represent Colorado,  Bennet is a political hack.
It is now obvious that we need a special prosecutor to investigate you.
Thank you for standing up for us! Gorsuch confirmation should also be held until this is resolved!
what's wrong with @GorsuchNeil?  Is he not qualified?  Or just because he's trumps pick?  Pretty petty.
wait until we know the truth about that situation. Surely you can see that?
No votes on Gorsuch until investigation complete. Please listen to your constituents.
what's wrong with @GorsuchNeil?  Is he not qualified?  Or just because he's trumps pick?  Pretty petty.
And no Gorsuch vote until after inquiry is complete
what's wrong with @GorsuchNeil?  Is he not qualified?  Or just because he's trumps pick?  Pretty petty.
oh should i write again here? AGREE~! NEED IT 100%. Thank You Again~Sir~!
Wonderful! Also -consider mental health evaluation for our erratic problem - trump.This will take generations to heal.
@mikosc4 you'll never get one in DC. Even our judges are biased
Yes
AND NO VOTE ON GORSUCH UNTIL COMPLETE.
spell correction: the senate needs to drop the stupid Russia idea, quit playing politics, and support fixing our country.
YES! Thank you!
you tweets are so cringe worthy. You should really stop this Russia narrative,  you sound like a conspiracy theorist.
ROFLMBO...Yet you let a traitor run WH for eight years without a word. Get stuffed. Satan better th obama.
And u need 2 vote NO for gorsuch!
well Libtard that's the straw. Always thought you were middle ground I see that's changed. No more votes for you!
Yes
.@SenBennetCO we need you to vote against Gorsuch that's what CO want. What you need to know abt Bennet & Gorsuch
name one reason why @GorsuchNeil is not a good judge? He used to be a judge for CO. Our state.
Speaking of the law, vote no on the Gorsuch confirmation.
The Senator is absolutely right. We need a special prosecutor and commission. Nothing else can be trusted.
Sure why not- all the facts are in-why not drag it out until 2020
Never in doubt to me. WH too closed, secretive, untrustworthy, untruthful, &totalitarian. It is their way or highway.
@SenCoryGardner please put everything else on hold until we know the facts.
yes push for ind prosecutor. No vote on Gorsuch or anything else until investigation completed & we know if Trump legitimate!
Where was all this urgency on Bengazi?
finally a brain capable of independent thought! Have a great day Kate!
Thank you for being such a great person and protecting our state and our people
how do we make that happen? !
It's the same FBI that cleared Hilary with her email scandal. Can't pick and chose when it works and when it doesn't.
another rational thinker! Have a great day Victor!
.@SenBennetCO thank you for representing us. #fightthegoodfight
I'm glad ur saying this welcome aboard the sane ship it sailed about 2 months ago, keep in step with @RepAdamSchiff ethical man
thank you. And NO on Gorsuch until investigation complete.
Not the actual crime of the leaks? Just the imaginary made up crime in your heads? @SenBennetCO @JeffreyGoldberg
Who leaked Flynn's private calls?
yes please!
yes indeed and lifetime appointment should be blocked until truth is found out.
So what about hard evidence of Hillary as opposed to hearsay no evidence with Trump, it wouldn't be political, its criminal!
- No votes on #45s nominees, policies - illegitimate Admin shld not get lifetime appt on #SCOTUS! Postpone #Gorsuch #Resist!
Yes! Please keep representing CO
Bravo! Now STOP Gorusch vetting until investigation concludes. DO NOT let them wipe their feet on R Constitution! Protect the USA.
GOP doing all it can to collapse America! Plz stand up to #Trumpcare #russiagate and #POTUS and his personal thugs
yes
agreed. Now make it happen.
and so postpone any #Gorsuch vote or don't confirm illegitimate Trump nominee.
Yes we do.  We ALSO need you to say NO to Gorsuch's confirmation. Do the right thing, please. Thank you!.
Yes, absolutely. This is imperative. Congressional committees are clearly not enough. Thank you, Sen. Bennet.
what will you do? How can we help?
No Gorsuch vote while Trumo is under FBI Investigation!
yes!  Thank you
Thank You, please fight hard not just for us in CO, but for the US and Democracy.
Sure we do. Lunatic left continues to double down on the fake Russian conspiracy theories.
Thank you. Please stand up strong for Colorado and America. Not a partisan issue. Republicans are calling for the same.
Thank You, Sir. Please, please push hard for this. We need the truth & accountability for our democracy. We're with you.
thank you. Now will you vote no gorsuch? #COProud #80220 #Trumprussia
What can we do to make that happen?
Yes, we do, and until we get to the bottom of this, no vote on Gorsuch.
YAWN...get on with doing the job we pay you to do. You didn't investigate Teddy Kennedy when HE ASKED Russia to interfere!
@deejay90192 Absolutely, we cannot trust Nunes, who is reluctant to seriously question wittinesses and now running  to trump
ABSOLUTELY!  Fully independent special prosecutor!  What's the way to make this happen???
Thank you @SenBennetCO I couldn't agree more with your assessment. So, let's do this.
True. While I have your attention, please vote against Gorsuch!
Stand up and yell, Senator. @Rep_DevinNunes must go. We must have a special prosecutor.
Yes please.
thank you. Keep demanding. No business as usual! #ThisIsNotNormal
thank you for hearing me in Grand Junction on Friday!
just ask for the surveillance reports on Trump!
but only after you help him fill a seat on SCOTUS? #StopGorsuch
@DevinNunes must also recuse himself from the current Investigation. He is misleading the public and protecting Trump. #bias
@SenCoryGardner @RepDLamborn Absolutely!  Please take action Colorado Reps.
Agreed. Especially because the Chairman of the House Intel Committee is clearly in Trump's pocket!
Thank you Senator
yes! Thank you! This must be investigated fully and without bias.
agree, thank you Senator Bennet!
Agreed. @ThunderHawk33 @SenBennetCO
Yes! How can we help get that going??
let's start with the Clinton Foundation?
So whatcha gonna do about it? Don't just Tweet. Act! Filibuster. Delay. Do not show up for the Gorsich vote.
what's wrong with @GorsuchNeil?  Is he not qualified?  Or just because he's trumps pick?  Pretty petty.
Thank you for your leadership
POSTPONE THE GORSUCH VOTE UNTIL THIS IS SETTLED!!!!
Thank you! This needs to happen
Yes and pls stop all administrative action until this investigation is complete
Yes! The R's are getting trapped in their tangled web of lies. It becomes more obvious everyday. D's need to stand up, save us.
completely agree. Dems need to put their grownup underwear on and FINALLY do something. At least make it difficult
why yes it is very obvious. Republican Party has out politicked us for years. Shameful
.@SenBennetCO Thank you! @SenCoryGardner What are your thoughts?
Yes! This is a nonpartisan issue @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan @SenCoryGardner @RepAdamSchiff Do the right thing
what a hack!I am looking forward to voting against you!
#adiosIN18 #adiosIN20
Thank you. No #Trumpcare no Gorsuch confirmation
We sent you there to make that happen!
Thank you! And please, NO DEALS of any kind. 

#StopGorsuch #Trumpcare #Trumprussia
Expect to hear you on KOA talking about how you will get this done tomorrow...Stand up for our country!!!
Thank you for representing CO and ensuring that we get to the bottom of this!
I thought we didn't approve Supreme Court Justices in the last year of a President's term.
And Gorsuch must go on hold until the matter's resolved. Can't make a lifetime appointment if he's not legitimately elected.
yes! And the man who needs investigation should not get any SCOTUS picks confirmed until we know the truth!
If Russian collusion is proven, and House impeaches- as Senator, will you vote to remove?
agree!
And you should think twice before confirming Trump's illegitimate SCOTUS pick.
Amen dude!
yes!  Please work to make this happen!
yes!!!
