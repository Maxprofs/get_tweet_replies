Please vote NO when it's your turn.
As a CO, I don't want to go back to the Dark Ages of insur denying coverage & jacking up premiums! Thank you!
Amy, premiums went up 10-20% a year with Obama Care, as did higher deductibles.  Exchanges collapsed and ins co  pulled out of markets.
preACA my prem went up 11-22% every year young & healthy & I paid $12k for each birth WITH insur! @SenBennetCO
My premium & deductible less w/ACA & MORE coverage & no denial of services. I LOVE ACA! @SenBennetCO
Thank you for speaking the truth. Please keep standing up for your constituents with pre-existing conditions. #ACA saved my life.
Sen Bennet doesn't seem to mind throwing public tax dollars to corporate education reformers who are dismantling public ed.
The truth, but it probably just hardens Trump's base: racists against Obama, rich people with no morals, and plain old idiots.
I'm certain no one really expected the Republicans to "fix" O-care. If they had any real desire or intent, they've had 7 yrs to try.

Thank you for fighting for Colorado Senator
It's a travesty that it passed the House.
So relieved to hear you say that sir. Why is it so easy to pass tax breaks for the wealthy and so hard to protect the poor and vulnerable?
Health care is out of control because we consume tons of healthcare. Ask better questions. The bill is not good  but Obamacare was terrible
Thank you for representing us! We're behind you!
Congratulations on writing a great Colorado Government Tweet: http://cogovtweets.measuredvoice.com/SenBennetCO/status/859896314213138432 â€¦ (Ranked 2nd for May 3.)
Please vote no on TrumpCare 2.0 if it comes to the Senate! It's too expensive and high risk pools don't work.
Republicans should be looking for another job come 2018. Congress is supposed to be working for the American people. Shame on you all.
"A tax cut for the wealthiest Americans masquerading as a health care bill." Thank you, @SenBennetCO, for speaking the truth.
The bill in the House is not a real health care fix. It's a tax cut for the wealthy that would throw 24 million people off health insurance.

Glad you mention Trump's talking point of the "forgotten man." If they didn't blindly follow him they would know this bill forgets them.
Don't support this unfair bill. Thank you.
Since when has the government demonstrated it can run anything?
Please keep standing up for all your constituents Senator. Thank you!
When is the last time you visited West Colo and asked workers about our current health care plans
Thank you for voting against this bill.
so should we stay with obamacare which you supported? Please work together instead of constant bashing .
@RepMikeCoffman @SenCoryGardner The proposed AHCA is bad for Coloradans - do not support it.
How can The Republican voter who has healthcare problems or anybody that calls themselves a Christian defend this? This has to be the Worse
Thank you Bennet! We need you to continue to truly represent us. We appreciate your efforts. Keep up the right fight.
Thank you for speaking out! @SenBennetCO
Thank you Senator Bennet!
Thank you!
Stop with the DMS for the poor shit you all proven lies and greed above all 
Thank you Senator Bennet, please vote no on repealing ACA.
Thank you Senator Bennet for standing up for Coloradans! We appreciate you!
You voted for the original ACA.    How can you criticize this bill.  You are one of the ones who broke it in the first place.
LIES, because in the US you can get treatment at any hospital even if you can't afford it.
Thank you, @SenBennetCO!
Keep fighting I'm behind you
Thank you for speaking the truth and for representing the majority of CO's voice. Sad that republicans are shady, #SuperDuperShady
Can you talk to @RepMikeCoffman @RepKenBuck @DougLambornCD5 @RepTipton for all of us on Colorado please. THEY need to vote NO on ACHA.
Give me a break. You voted for a bill that threw hundred of thousands off their plans & is in a death spiral.
Since when is our government mandated to be responsible for peoples medical insurance. Insurance is not in the constitution! This is insane!
thank you
can you please explain that to @RepMikeCoffman as he doesn't understand that thousands in CO6 lose insurance if he votes yes
If that hype is true, the GOP will certainly be viewed nationwide as the party of loons.
Personally, I would rather not foot the bill for insurance for others than my family. Bill sucks just as bad as Obamacare.
As a resident of Colorado, thank you!
This is disgusting. Please keep fighting.
Thank you for your principled opposition to a horrible bill!
I am so glad that you get it. Now, about today's attack on separation of church and state....
Thank you Sir for fighting for all Americans. Proud that you are my Senator! 
Thank you, Senator.
#Trumpcare   Claim the name now!
@SenateDems LYING FAKE NEWS BABY KILLER

No matter what the #GOP puts out there, 4 million more lose coverage in addition 2 the 20 million that got it under the ACA. #MedicareForAll
Will you donate your tax cut?
What 24 million are you talking about?

thank you @SenBennetCO for pointing out what this really is - we can improve on healthcare, not this.
Thank You Senator ! You make Colorado proud ...
Source? You realize that is 4M more that what Obamacare is estimated to have enrolled? 20 mil still uninsured, but I'm sure you knew that
Thank you for listening to those whom you represent
Please make sure all Senate Dems are on board to oppose
So things are going according to #GOP plan. #cowards

Keep up the great work on behalf of all of us. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you for staying strong & sticking up for all people! Stop the nonsense and offer REAL healthcare for all. We need to do better
I prefer the one page bill that simply repeals the whole damn thing and puts nothing in its place.
Fight
Thank you for standing up for us.
Sounds about right.

Thank you!
It is not a health care fix. All members of congress should be required to enroll in any #healthcare bill they pass.

#fakenews
Thank you for speaking the truth @SenBennetCO
Sick of your resistance Bennet. You can and will be replaced! Stop resisting and work with the republicans. Tired of your self service 
How can anyone support a bill that you don't even know what's in it and how it's gonna affect you ?
Those who say it's gonna be better I feel sorry for you all because until it affects you, that's when u gon wake up & by then it'll b 2late
If it gets to the senate I would hope that you vote against it.  The bill is a complete sham and @HouseGOP is lying about it.
Powered by Pure hatred for Americans.
Que the violin.
This bill is a disgrace and disgusting! A slap to the faces of the people who voted for him and more poverty for the poor,Sad!
