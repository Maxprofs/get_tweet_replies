Celebrating repeal of the #JonesAct! #resist #enlist #persist #impeachment #notmypresident #mangomussolini #maga #magats #PuertoRico #GOP – at Lake Orion High School
When are we going to identify the anti-McCain accounts that are Russian?
I'm sure Trump would collaborate w Putin to hurt Sen. McCain.  Check this out>> http://bit.ly/2fn0SNa 
They are out in full force today. Bots/trolls and real accounts from left and right attacking mccain. Putin/trump are so scared of him.
McCain’s a jerk!
Before you have the right to criticize McCain, you must endure what he endured as a prisoner of war. Are you down for that?
Careful, Judy. I reported that account and replied to it with an #opbot meme. Lots of auto posts. We don't want to attract trolls/bots.
Am I attracting trolls/bots. Is Mrs. Grundy a troll/bot? This is too much!
If it is a troll, there is a person behind it. If you see one that has left a comment a few hours ago, don't reply back. It restarts them.
Just for PR or will it include HI and AK?
More political theater that will take jobs from Americans or American companies.
You should be President of our great country.... much admiration for you sir. 
How about just repeal it?
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
Traitor McCain
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator McCain.
Thank u, thank u, thank u!!!  Please make it happen.
Thanks Senators. It's the right thing to do.
Senator John McCain, you just keep on being a hero!!!!
Trump will visit, sell his hats and say everything is fine. Can a high ranking military official tell ppl and show what is being done?
We know from reporters that the situation is bad, but it's hard when ppl believe 45 doesnt care and lies. Can someone in Senate visit?
Your a good person John
 Watch your back. Trump is dangerous to America!
What have you done for the people of Arizona that you lied to to get reelected?  Waiting
Not needed. Must keep control of ships entering ports. Go do something about repealing Obamacare.
Thank you senators
UR the reason Trump changed his mind about PR.  U brought the Jones Act to our attention.  W/O U PR would still not get help. Thank you!
 Thanks
McCain is an American and Republican traitor. Would not be surprised if McCain and Putin are best buds. McCain ... stop f_ _ _king America

Thank you for your hard work
Please keep fighting for us, Senator McCain!
THANK YOU Senator McCain. Your long public service is of great value; 10 day waiver is insufficient. Please continue support for #PuertoRico
This is good. Anything to relieve their suffering & let them know their lives are important & we care abt them. God bless you John McCain.
Please retire.  #liar
No doubt you’ll vote against it at some point in your pathetic career!
From your hands @SenJohnMcCain to those with clear heads & moral hearts
Why wasn't this done 50 years ago, or even 10 yrs? Not doing your jobs I think.
Thank you for this!! Hopefully, it passes unanimously!!
Thank you for doing what's right.
Good move! The #JonesAct is silly and outdated at the best of times, and archaic constipated bureaucracy at the worst. #PuertoRicoStrong
Wish you well, time to support the POTUS!  U in office too long, drain the swamp
@MarkWarner and @timkaine I am a Virginia constituent originally from PR. I urge you to back @SenJohnMcCain on this bill.
@SenJohnMcCain, you have been a hero to many! Agree 100% with this! Thank you again and again and again :)
Yeeeeeeessss!!!! thank you thank you thank you!!!! 
Need the bill amended to forgive the $74billion debt, if we can forgive Mexico's debt from 30 plus years ago, we surely can do it for PR.
.THIS...if you read nothing else today...THIS! Yet again, the Senator from AZ proves he is an AMERICAN hero , believes in bipartisanship (and knows it is how America works best) helps to save #PuertoRico and specifically calls @realDonaldTrump bluff!! #Genius 
My family and me have you in our prayers that God may bless and place His healing hands over you.
From our hearts thank you thank you
Thank you, @SenJohnMcCain.As always, you save the day.

You are a life saver in cesspool of greedy incompetents.Thank you, Sir! God Bless You! 
How to make Donald look at Puerto Rico
Globalist move.

In the same way protectionism has been hindering long-term recovery for #PuertoRico , it also hinders growth for US. Please repeal entirely.
Good to see real work being done. Thanks
Thank you Senator McCain, I pray for you& family.My father was shot down in http://Vietnam.You  are a true American Hero
We don’t want the #JonesAct rescinded!!!
That’s another way for you to give away American jobs!!!
Thank you, Senator! I hope my NJ Senators @SenatorMenendez  and @SenBooker will consider lending their support as well!
Try to be the conscious of the President. He is flawed, crippled by a lack of moral backbone. You have an abundance. Do your best. Please.
Thank you and Sen Lee for doing this. Puerto Rico should have been permanently exempt years ago.
Include USVI and Guam too.
Pretend the military industrial complex bombed    the island nation, now we can rebuild it like Iraq.  Oops for got no one makes money here!
Wish you cared at all about Arizona and keeping your promises.
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
Thank you, again! Sen. McCain! And thank you for changing many expectations. We do all have to work together - that is true patriotism.
Way to go Team McCain!!! Your Legacy will carry on for years to come. God Speed stay blessed
Thank you for acting, because we have a president who is not acting.
Way to go!
i tellya john is batting a 1000
Thank you for your continued service.
Need to add HI, Guam and USVI to that as well.  Not for relief but for sensible regs sake.
THANK YOU. IT'S ABOUT TIME. TOOK A DEVASTATING HURRICANE TO GET U.S. CONGRESS TO FOCUS ON THIS, BUT PLEASE PASS BILL ASAP!
Thanks a lot. Jones Act a relic of world war I needs immediate repeal for Puerto Rico welfare and growth
I wish you nothing less than good health & happiness
Capt John as one of Americas true heroes I am appalled at your treatment for political advantages.May I apologize to you this mistreatment
A republican with a heart of gold.   Thank you Senator.
Thank you sir!!!
Well done @SenJohnMcCain
Thank u This shd have been done yrs ago. Keep pushing to help ALL Americans. Save us from republican greed, waste & corruption!!!
Thank you for your persistance!
Well done... #JohnMcCain #HeServedHisCounty
Thank you Senator. The humanitarian need is desperate.
THANK YOU!
Thank you for your decency.  Such a need elixir for the toxic brew of our current politics. God bless.
ANOTHER "right thing to do move" by McCain gotta  him!
well played
How about term limits?  Any movement there? HaHaHaHaHa - just kidding.
Thanks for doing something right, for a change. 
Completely agree. Jones Act is obsolete!
Thank you for advocating for the US Citizens of Puerto Rico!  #JonesAct @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @marcorubio @MarkWarner @timkaine
If PR wants to be a territory and get tax money, they obey the Jones Act...period. If not let them be a sovereign nation w/o US support.
Thank you Brother McCain for recognizing this outdated law was strangling Puerto Rico's economy.  We are with you all the way.
I LOVE IT A VETERAN, POW, VERY RESPECTABLE MAN/OFFICER AT WORK FOR THE PEOPLE AND COUNTRY!!
Thank you
My hope is you both win this one. PR would not be in the bad shape it's in if it weren't for the Jones Act.
Go kick some butt Senator McCain. The time is now to repair PR the fort of the Caribbean!

McCain just torpedoed what is keft of our merchant marine & US shipping. Now foreign owned shipping will get the business & US will the bill
We love and appreciate you! Thank you! 
Now we need and "invasion" force of us military with trucks,, etc to distribute food, medicine, water and set up communication systems.
Thank you!
A clean repeal is in order Senator. This is no time for #HalfMeasures.
Someone worthy of the presidency. Thnk u Mr. McCain. U continue 2be a hero for our country. Can we impeach @realDonaldTrump and put u in? 
@SenJohnMcCain  you should be the #POTUS
Looser, help Trump repeal Obamacare.
That's how things should work when citizens are here n trouble unlike bone head trump he has so much on his plate w/ football and russiagate
Bless you!!!  More lives saved!! Those people need long term help, it could take years!!! I can't believe it was only lifted for 10 days!!
Why not repeal obamacare like you promised...
How about pushing to exempt people from the punishment of Obamacare??
How about giving 'em a vote? Hell,call them a state & make honest citizens of 'em. Conservative values? @SenateFloor @NancyPelosi @tedlieu
If you going to make PR exempt, you need to make Guam Hawaii and other far flung islands exempt as well.
Something he votes yes on? Wow.
Hope it passes quickly!

A day late and a dollar short.  POTUS has already exempted Puerto Rico from #JonesAct.  These two should focus on healthcare & tax reform
It was about time. 
May the Lord bless you and help you conquer in your efforts sir!
Great job Senator!
The president should veto any bill you introduced. He should allow someone else to introduce this important bill
At least someone in congress cares about Puerto Rico! Trump obviously does not. He's too busy watchng tv & tweeting about minor stuff.
yea!
thanks once again for loving and serving our Country!
Once again, you have earned respect and admiration across the aisle.(I still don’t get the Sarah Palin thing)
Thanks Senator. You're the master of original thought. #bandwagon #RINO #GrandStanding
Retire you traitor to the republicans. Something is definitely wrong with you!!! Stupidity
Great work!!
I think Trump beat you to it
What do I tell my father? When can he get these supplies#runningoutoftime
Permanently remove Ocare exemption for you and swamp buddies. Hypocrite.
Thank you to you both true American heroes
#lovingthemaverick
Thank you Senator McCain and Senator Lee.
You ROCK!!!
Sick family on the island. Want to evac them at persona expense but can't. Allegedly the 51st state of the union. HELP!!!
Royal Caribbean is evac. Family of employees not/others. Legal?
Thank you sir! God bless you and your family
Did you also permanently exempt the "McCain Act"? You know the one where you Always Vote against America.
How about permanent removal of Ocare exemption for congress
Great news!
Thank you  @SenJohnMcCain
@SenateGOP @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr please #BeLikeJohnMcCain
Berlin airlift.  Use planes, helicopters to get supplies to people when not able to use roads
It's ridiculous that Puerto Rico wasn't already exempt permanently, being that they are a US territory.

God bless you. Thank you for your kindness and for always helping those in need.
Thank you for wanting to do what I've been asking for that last two days! All PRicans need to get behind u on this! We need change!!!!
Puerto Rico needs our help,do away with #JonesAct @repjimcooper @TheDemCoalition @Alyssa_Milano @WhitfordBradley @DemNational @MattMurph24
Thank You Senator!
Thank you!
SENATOR WHY DO YOU WANT IT PERMANENTLY !WHAT ARE THEIR GOALS ?WHAT PRICE DID YOU PAY?
Thank you Senator-I believe this is correct step to help our Island citizens recover strongly in cost effective manner. I support this step.
The Joes act has done nothing to prevent US Aid from entering PR. You should be held accountable for your treasonous actions.
Excellent!  Glad you're back in the fight.
@SenatorCantwell @PattyMurray I, as your constituent, urge you to support Senator McCain on this bill. Jones Act is un-American.
Senator McCain, Thank you for being a guiding light and a man of integrity.
John you are a trader and me to think you would put American sailors out of work you are a real ass and you deserve to get voted out
You guys need to do a lot more than that. Puerto Rico has been neglected for too long
I get that I'm an empath but fiscally, it never made sense 2 leave countrymen in squalor w/ an economy tax based, u can't tax them. Thank u
Thank you for standing up for American citizens once again when other republicans shamefully fail America to promote corporate interests
GOD BLESS YOU

Fighting for those without a voice & for fairness to @PuertoRicoPUR 
That's what AMERICAN HEROES DO 

I STILL BELIEVE 
You should introduce healthcare reform
The only bill you need to be focusing on is a OBAMACARE REPEAL BILL!! #KeepthePromise
How about just repealing it?
Thank You..Very Much On Behalf Of All My Family Who Are Still Unaccounted For..In Ponce
You go Mr. McCain!!!
I’ve never voted for you, & I’ve rarely agreed with you, but this I agree & thank you for! Thank you for your service & I wish you well!
Thank you 
Strong support from Senators! Thanks for your work!
Thank you 
Just move to help our fellow Americans now and forget politics please.
Thank you for your humbleness and courage! May God bless you!
How fast can this happen to save American lives now?
Those who don't vote "yea" will NOT get reelected. Pass it on....
Because Puerto Rico  is  an  Island permanently except in this humanitarian Crisis is what Puerto Rico Needs God Bless United States and PR
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 100% are Christians, God  bless  you, I voted  for  you in 2008 make  it into a law, Jones act is archaic,
Thanks you@SenJohn McCain and@SenMikeLee ,for your help to Puerto Rico.
Great idea.  Puerto Rico deserves to be treated the same as any other American territory.
Puerto Rico died and  defend the US Constitution, love and voted for statehood with 96% of the votes . It is time to eliminate that old law.
Puerto Rico needs  that I am a veteran,  250k died defending the  constitution and the current puertorican americans we are Christians in PR
Why didn't you fight this hard for ACA
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for fighting for #PuertoRico. 10 day waiver of #JonesAct is not a long term solution for recovery. #RepealJonesAct
I continue to thank God for you and your service every day Senator! 
Thank you, Senator McCain! I agree that this is needed for the long-term economic recovery
@realDonaldTrump 
AIRHEAD legislation, Senator, but why should we expect anything else from you. Your always out of touch. Maybe OBAMACARE or VA can help you.
Doing what needs to be done. There's no better time to do away with the Jones Act. Thank you for your efforts!
There you go Senator McCain always doing the best thing for all Americans. We all love you so much!! Thanks
You should include Hawaii as well.
Well, you picked a loser with Lee. He has not passed a meaningful piece of legislation that has actually done average Americans any good.
Please proceed with total repeal of the Jones Act.
