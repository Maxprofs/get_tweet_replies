The GOP seems hellbent on destroying everything beautiful. Prove me wrong Senator.
Here's a tweet u can send out to the Sheep. The GOP like Ted Roosevelt is all about protecting our Nat'l Parks, so we can Hunt! Let's Drill!
Protect our national parks, our environment our earth. Or go find another planet to live on and take your GOP friends with you STAT.
Yes, it's truly beautiful. Gods gift to America. But how will it look when trump starts drilling there?  Get rid of that lunatic.
FUN FACT:
Trump has well knownbties to Russian mob and you know it.
#TrumpRussiaCoverUp Check this out John

I find it hard to believe you are tweeting anything about @NatlParkService while your party destroys them.  #Outoftouch

Yet, it can not hold all of Trumps lied
All due respect; you can get your tax cuts/AHCA/etc with a President Pence, and still save our democracy. IMPEACH.
how about making Comey the special prosecutor
Please not Cornyn for FBI. Based on Senate hearings etc, 100% concern re leaks/unmasking, 0% re cover up of ties to foreign adversary.

#Trumprussia
I have another fun fact. Our president is mentally unstable. Forget the politics for a moment--eventually he's going to do permanent damage.
Fun recommendation: U & @SenSchumer should both stand on the rim of the Grand Canyon & cry fake tears together b/c well its what you do now.
Fun fact: GOP including @SenJohnMcCain needs to find the courage to step up and defy DJT and deflect his insanity. So apparent! Scary
Sorry not in the mood for fun facts today, sir. Where is your loyalty after all these years, your party or your country?
Beautiful, isn't it?  Until the EPA allowing drilling and fracking & other crap.
It's almost as vast as Trump's lies and the GOP conspiracy to keep him in power at all costs.
It's time to start the articles of #impeachment. Otherwise this atrocity of a President will be your legacy.

So when are you going to let Agent Orange take the GC for mining or oil exploration?
Time to find a way to investigate investigate independently of fear, of accusations. #TruthtrumpsTrump.
The time is shy midnight, if you choose otherwise, you choose the wrong side of history. I live in a blue state, we need GOP help. 1 United
America wants someone like you, like Graham to, Sass, to take an actual stand for the sake of all. Patriotism is bipartisan. United We Stand
John, now is the time for you to once again stand up for the country you love. Now is the time for patriots of all sides to protect. #stand
You care about nature?  So what are you doing to protect monuments and national parks against Pruitt and the EPA climate deniers?
Fun fact. You will go down in history as a traitor unless you stand up and investigate #TrumpRussianInvestigation
Sounds like Mt Denali but the opposite direction!
I wanted to do a Fun Fact too but others have it covered so I'll just say Mr. McCain  do your fucking job and protect our country from 45.
FOR GOD SAKE,what does it take for you and your colleagues to ACT. Are you all truly this BLIND? This is beyond insanity now! TAPES, OMG

How much are drilling rights to our national parks going for these days and what's your cut?
Know what else changes weather patterns? Global warming! Its not a Chinese conspiracy after all! To have a president from @GOP u sold US out
@SenJohnMcCain let me know when it's no longer a Nat'l Park.  I'll sigh and mumble to myself....just like I'm doing now.
You said there needs to be action taken on the comey firing and then don't do anything. Nice work.
So let me ask you McCain "what does the president need to do for you to show urgency if corruption is not enough?"
