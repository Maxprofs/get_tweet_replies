INTERACTIVE: Under #BRCA, older & low-income people would see largest premium increases compared to #ACA http://kaiserf.am/2tErJhl  

@SenJeffFake enjoy your last days in the Senate #Traitor
Pork barrel spending is as old as the country itself. Please go on 2 other, more pressing matters.
I wish America would have supported you in the same manner that you support the President while you were a POW. Absolutely shameful.
Yet you continue to vote for corp welfare and tax cuts for the #oligarchy
I'm angry about what you did today! You're shameful.
Country before politics. trump got elected because people were tired of partisan, gridlock and fearmongering. Ban,wall,campaign polorized us
I have never done anything but vote. I'm 55 and I plan on donating, traveling to get people elected the next election. Terrified of policies
If we cut defense spending and pork we can join the club of wealthy nations that have healthcare for everyone. Healthcare should be a right
No pork. Use pork to help people with ACA, education for nontech people. APPRENTICESHIPS need funding now NOT studies. Real solutions
Priorities-Fix ACA-No tax cut to rich or loopholes- Campain reform transparency, no elect.coll.-Education, expand apprenticeships nation wd
wimpy duelists aren't in congress for idealism.
PS VOTE NO TODAY
If only someone in government forever did some work other than Hillary bashing and stripping away healthcare!
And yet republicans govern. Everything.
Then what the heck have you and protege' Flake been doing all these years? Just flappin your gums resulting more spending!!! #DrainTheSwamp
You're part of the pork producer on bills. You're a Dem in reality
We know your recovering but are you going to Washington to vote tomorrow on a healthcare bill no one has seen?
And are you for it?  Or agin it...?
No one in swamp cares not one of 535 swampers
Swamp stinch starting to really get bad under @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Take your medicine, five joints a day, peace to your body 2nd favorite vet, behind my grandpa Alan Thurman who did in WWII, army man
And who's leading the cause - your Party Mr McCain.

Yes sir.  The big problem in the White House right now is pork.  Our president's praising Putin and trashing our allies but hey, Pork! 
What do you think is happening with the wealth care bill? Billions being thrown at, so Senators can vote on a bill they know nothing about.
GET THE HORSES BEFORE THE CART'S !
I WANT MY PENALTY'MONEY'BACK !
REPEAL AND REPLACE!!!!!

Isn't McConnels's entire plan to pass his (horrible) healthcare bill, pork barrel pay offs?  I hope you kill this bill sir, for Ted!

You could start with your travel.  During the last recess you & a few of your colleagues headed to Afghanistan on the government dime.
The smirk of Flake's face says it all.  He could care less.
How long have you and the @GOP controlled Congress and all pork barrel spending?
So let's fix that and put it toward health care! #ProtectOurCare #FixACA #NoOnMTP

$6.8 million new pork Congress put in budget,33.3 % rise from last year, this is the peoples money your wasting @SenateMajLdr  @SenateFloor
My Prayers are with You Mr. Senator. Stay tough. Thank You for ALL Your Service 
That averages out to roughly $13 billion / year.
US military spending / year exceeds China's (next biggest) by
$400 billion / year.
Chasing pennies while dollars fly away.
Hope you're not ok with hurting our most vulnerable communities? #NoCutsToMedicaid #SaveOurCare #BCRAp #SinglePayer
These graphs make pretty clear that BCRA does NOT provide access to health care for those with low incomes: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/07/20/how-bcra-2-0-would-impact-enrollee-costs-according-to-your-age-and-income/ …

Of course it continues to grow. This isn't new, but politicians have excelled recently in lining their pockets v running our country.
