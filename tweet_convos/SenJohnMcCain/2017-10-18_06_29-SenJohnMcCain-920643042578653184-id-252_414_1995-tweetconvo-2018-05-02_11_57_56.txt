You are a treasure.
I don't agree with your politics but you have really shown that you care about what happens in America & by extension the rest of the world
I'm not a Republican but I think him for saving millions of Americans from certain harm and death by voting down Trump care.
****thank (dang...I'm not the best phone typer )
Being British and growing up with the NHS I literally cannot process the thinking that healthcare is not a right but a privilege.
I honestly feel that those who feel healthcare isn't a right but a privilege have no humanity and are cruel human beings.
Thank you for your service, now please resign
Come now, let us not wish the man Ill will, Resigning will be sufficient.
God Bless you John McCain you are truly an American Hero and a superb human being!
You ended telling lies to the voters. This is how you will get in the history , as a liar senator.
Thank you for saving millions of Americans from certain harm or death by voting down Trumpcare.
Hard to hear you speak in such a way after 8 years of Obama condemning the US as the source of all problems in the world. Respect is gone!
Trump is leading down the path of shame he speaks of. It's embarrassing to be an American under this administration. Hope, trust gone
And I’m embarrassed that you live here. Norway wants you.
 Nah. Even though I'm embarrassed to live here I'll stay and fight the good fight to restore what's now lost. #Resistance #25thAmmendment
Thank you for honoring our country sir. You are an American hero! #JohnMcCain
the other day I was reminded of the tragedy onboard the USS Forestall that you caused. Have you ever apologized for it John! Daddy swept it
ANYONE who disrespects this, MAN is a coward! Hes a war hero, n does what's right not jus follows along like his party
I'm an Independent but I have always admired and respected you. Thank you for your life long service to this country.
Lost that admiration after finding out he's a liar, like #45. I thought he was above that & Dotard dragged him right in.
Sorry...thought this was about Kelly.  Will always respect and admire Senator McCain.  He doesn't lie.
We will never forget that you cast your vote/s on healthcare to save millions in USA from terrible suffering and/or death.Thank you Senator!
He will always be my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE republican. I pray for u n your beautiful family daily. Keep fighting sir WE u
Does your wife ever call you "sugar cane"?

DJT #MAGA
Thank you Senator McCain! You are a true American hero! Keeping you in my prayers!
Retire! You're not making good decisions anymore for Americans. Thinking you're a liberal.
He saved Thousands of American people from trump. that what a hero does.
1/Senator, you honor us all with your service and by the eloquence of your words, which will remain in the hearts of each American...
THANK U for standing up and saying what NEEDS to be said!!!!
Thank you, @SenJohnMcCain for your insights and honesty.

Senile John McCain gets angry at reporter who asks why he’s blocking President Trump on every issue. 
Check out all these speeches by the liar!
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
A courageous speech from a corageous hero. Never needed a hero more than we need today. Our country is calling upon you once again Sir.
He is no hero.  He's a demented old man that is a globalist traitor.
Not a troll - just aware of the evil that lurks behind that poor excuse for a man.
Sorry should have translated for you... тролль!
You make me proud to be from Arizona!
Stealing money from the taxpayers, selling out Veterans, screwing over our nation for money from  your lobbyist buddies.
Sen. McCain just like to say that was a great speech and thanks for everything you have done and continue to do for our country.
Nancy Pelosi write that for you?
Sen. McCain is a patriot and hero.
Ur Amerika. No good jobs, no economic growth, shrinking military, inner city killings, no borders, Sanctuary Cities. Ur Amerika is not r's
Swamp Inc
Thank you sir for your incredible service to this country.  We need more Republicans like you.  Keep up the fight.
I just come here to see the pathetic Liberals drool over a Republican you  Pres. Bush You failed Pres. McCain. Soon you'll Pres. Trump
Please somebody get a wheel chair and take McCain home so he quits talking
What is senate Rs had 49 more John McCains!
I admire you as do many  .But trump and sessions are leading us to a dictatorship, we need to get him out now before it is too late

John McCain should be in jail! He should have been tried 4 treason & war crimes after Vietnam!! Bailed out by Nixon w/a Presidential pardon!
Sounded Angry, Bitter and disconnected from the purpose of his role representing the American people. Ignoring corruption must #fanniegate
Where is the Tax Reform and Tax Cuts for the Americans Mr Senator?
Dear Senator, Our warmest congratulation & admiration  for your #LibertyMedal Award. #Iranians appreciate your stand for a #FreeIran!
So why are you trying to destroy it? Why are you selling out to Soros New World Order. Shame on you, once a traitor always a traitor.
Sen. McCain you are deplorable and un-redeemable
@SenJohnMcCain when will you start being a republican again and remember why you were elected BY THE PEOPLE. #needtoretire


The spurious person himself
The McCain legacy... sabotaging own party's agenda, extreme military waste, unnecessary wars,and saving Obamacare.Shameful political career.
The one he gave the reporter after he asked if he tries to stop Trump at every turn. You act like that when you know he was correct. Truth
I have seen snippets.  Excited to read.  You are a treasure.
#ELD_OR_ME  this will cripple the transportation industry look for yourself ATA is leading you like sheep to slaughter look at @OOIDA
Thank you, Senator McCain!
Again. Thank you for representing what a true American should strive to be like
It wasn't even a good speech.  Simple propaganda of te globalist agenda type.
You have betrayed the American voters. We voted to support a new better America and you are fighting to keep control over American choice
Love you Sen. McCain! and I consider myself a Democrat! You are a Hero!
You spent 60 years costing American lives and money you are a sorry excuse for a public servant you should be tried and jailed you POS
McCain, You are pathetic. Step bk and look at yourself. You cannot talk about anthing you have done in DC..because you do zero..except talk
Sen. McCain makes me very proud to be from AZ  as well as an American. He is the epitome of integrity, grace, patriotism and humanity.
Congratulations Senator. You deserve this medal more than anyone else!
Patting yourself on the back is childish. Self serving, elite, lying politician. We should investigate the money trail of your wealth. #MAGA
Congratulations on your great achievement
Wow McCain your response to Peter Doocy was spot on for a narcissistic traitor like you
Another memento for your love me wall.
You truly are an America hero and Senator, I laud you for your service to our country.  Damn those who call into question!
and have hate in your heart
Washington would be a better place if McCain would go home.
#retire
You are a RINO join the Dems. 7/31/1967 YOU KILLED 137 AMERICANS  YOU ARE A FRAUD
Your words and actions in this difficult time for our Country mean more than you will ever know.  Thank you.
You have disappointed me not that it should matter to you. Thought you were a true patriot
McCain's lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country is equal to Bowe Bergdahl's serving the United States with honor and distinction.
AND AMERICA IS SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT JOHN MCCAIN.  THANK YOU!
No one but swsmp dwellers care what you say or think. Hypocrisy speaks too loud
Dear Sir, I am afraid, the USA is no longer the most wondrous land, no longer either Leader of the free world. Very Sad. Change must come
McCain I voted for you when you runned for president but you are a complete different person now! Your cognitive deterioration is public!
McCain had his speech written by the Democrats and he should resign! Have a family intervention re his cognitive public deterioration!
Do you think you walk on water too? Are you just the greatest person to walk the earth since Jesus or what?
Did you have any illegal dealings with the Clintons McCain? What are you hiding? Support the POTUS
Bla, bla, bla, I hate Trump Bla, bla, bla America Sucks, bla, bla, bla, you all suck, Bla, bla, Bla.. is that about it??
That's why you're trying to ruin it?
Thank you for having the courage to say what 70% of Americans are thinking. Unfortunate that most GOP leadership are cowards.
good now leave after your 60 years so we can make our Wonderous Land better
tears in my eyes
Next I can see you sitting for the national anthem
What I heard you say was all Republicans are wrong for wanting closed borders and protect the American people.
That's what I heard
Congrats Sen. McCain u Great War hero
As well it should be!
Thank u for trying to save us
Should be the part where you call out Nazis and White suprematism.  Ty for your service!
Now please do the right thing and vote against tax plan.
As you line your pockets with tax payers money. Your just another Dem screwing the tax payers.
Who lines your pockets hater
You are a great man
You're not done yet, Maverick. Glad to see the you've returned to your old form. Call out this administration every chance you get.
God Bless you Sen McCain. You are a true American Hero, and defender of our democracy & our Constitution. History will remember you proudly!
It's because of honorable men like you that it is a wondrous land. Thank you, Sir!
Nothing like constantly patting yourself on the back!  Very humble person..
Patting himself on the back for not supporting any Trump legislation. He's letting down his party- and MSM sings his praises. Disgusting.
laughing at the adulations from people who never served or know the REAL Songbird McCain. Pig meet lipstick.
We all know now that you're just an angry Career Politician. If you really respected being a congressman, you wouldn't have made it a career
"Why would you say something that dumb?"

 You never change Songbird. Treason is your legacy
Hi traitor McCain democrat in sheep clothing p.o.s
We like it when ppl are up front & honest. Quit acting like a politician. It wasn't a stupid question, it was an honest question.
Thanks for your effort, you have become a true hero...
A hero to who? Isis? McCain is a pos, wish he’d spend his final months with his family
You gave a heart felt speech. audacity of hope message. Thank you for your years of service, contribution and speaking your mind.Blessings.
Well said
You are off the rails. Time to resign or SWITCH PARTIES.
Ya know what, having brain cancer is NO EXCUSE for treating Peter Doocy the way you did. He was just asking you what EVERYBODY thinks. Jerk.
Sooo this country is not allowed to become powerful and wealthy I guess everybody is supposed to take advantage of us too...
Wonder if tax cuts for himself and his "kids" is more or less than what campaign donors offers for... more ways than one to be corrupt
You are a hypocrite and a closet Dem.
Stop promoting your leftist fake Rhino beliefs
WHY ARE BUMP FIRE STOCKS STILL LEGAL? THEY ALLOW SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO FIRE LIKE MACHINE GUNS LIKE THE VEGAS SHOOTER USED! WTF?
Sir nobody can dispute your patriotism but you've become obstructionist. No good..get things done and help #MAGA
Yes, MAGA by staying steadfast to the truth that trump is dividing us through his spurious nationalism and needs to be removed from office.
Why Trump is not registered as a sex offender!!!
Thank you for that service, Senator McCain. As lifelong Dem I often disagree w/your policies, but sure admire you, your integrity, courage.
That was the best speech that I have ever heard from a true American hero & servant of the people!God bless you!Your legacy will live on
don't forget what daddy did john mctrump

Thank you Senator McCain...
Excellent speech.  Glad I got the opportunity to read in its entirety. You are a good man!
Yes. Without DJT it is.
Thank you for your speech, Senator.  I'm a lefty, but  do appreciate you as hero and  patriot.  We share a love of country & sense of duty.
If you are serious, please help other republicans pass the new tax law and get rid of this stupid, America killing ACA.
#RetireNow
#McCainIsALiar
Thank you! Keep up the great work! You are the hero
You are a disgraceful senator of America. Resign now to save Americans
No thanks. Your left wing obstructionist will probably listen to your crap.
Greatest service u can now give this country is to either push for #25thAmendment or #Impeachment for the obviously unfit @realDonaldTrump
Good Luck!
United States is supposed to be the shinning city on the hill.     People are trying to make us an exclusive manhattan high rise.
Correction: 60 years of feeding at the gov trough to enrich yourself and your globalist friends. Shame on you. Tell the truth.
How's that lockjaw?
How's Kate's Law, tax cuts a healthcare coming?  The President, whom you have a DUTY to support, is waiting to sign the legislation.
My hero Senator John McCain.
You are a disgrace to the nation and that will be your legacy. Sadly when/if you read this, your senility and jealousy will laugh it off.
Thank you for love of, and service to our nation.  Thank you for speaking truth, when so many in Congress remain silent.
Great, now when will POTUS DICKHEAD start the sanctions on Russia. Trump is trying to play Congress and your allowing it.DO SOMETING NO TALK
On point as usual, Senator.
A great American.  Trump should be careful about attacking him.
A great speech Sir. Thank you

Team photo 
except...
I wonder how much money he "donated" to Trump? Starts and ends with a 0, I'll give you a minute to look it up.
Again, so what! You nuts keep posting PICS of him with Democrats like that means anything. NO ONE KNEW about his crazy when he donated.
Wrong...they all knew
You’re a bitter old traitor.
Couldn't agree more with your idea of America! Thank you for your service. Praying for you daily
Tax cuts

Remind me of how trump has served the country.
Oh, right, he hasn't. He's only served himself through fraud & greed. He's a daily disgrace.
You're "Speech" proves what a HATEFUL, BITTER OLD MAN you really are! A LIFETIME TRAITOR to AMERICANS! Jealous of Trump SUCCESS!
It will be in the history books!
You are a true patriot. your service proof it. Donald Trump is a fake a phony a draft Dodger with five deferments, he is not  patriotic.

John McCain we are two different individuals, with two different ideologies, but I respect your service and your commitment to our country
I don't always agree with you, but I respect you as a stand up guy. Thank you for your service to this country.
Way to long, and honestly your not serving the people well right now, pass tax reform, build the wall, replace Obamacare hurts workers.
