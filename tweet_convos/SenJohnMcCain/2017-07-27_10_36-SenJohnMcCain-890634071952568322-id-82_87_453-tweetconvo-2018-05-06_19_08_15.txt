U lied
Ask McCain how the fire got started & who started it.
She doesn't care. She's a politician now.
At least there ARE some vets out there that KNOW FOR SURE!  I just found out he was convicted & sentenced to death by the firing squad!
He got a pardon from Nixon.
Yea, that's SOME real Bull Shit there!
Well stated. That tragic event should b remembered.
You missed your call to die for our country
Johnny "Wet Start" McCain started the fire and his daddy bailed his ass out.
Too bad you cut and ran like a coward and took that first Helo off!
John McCain CAUSED these deaths. This is obscene, to rub salt in the wounds like this. Shame on you.
Takes a lot of balls
R u nuts? John McCain is the one who blew up tbe Carrier by showing off doing a wet start and then he got out of there helping no one. Ck it
Didn't @SenJohnMcCain start all that? And his daddy protected him?
Isn't that the fire that MCCain started

Why didn't you help with firefighting efforts? Why did you abandon your shipmates? #COWARD
Why was your cowardly ass the first person evacuated from the ship even though you weren't injured? #COWARD
And how do you honor them? You send America closer to socialism and a single payer system. The legacy you had is up in flames traitor #rhino
I, too, would like to applaud John McCain for this example of his incredible talent for shirking personal sacrifice http://rol.st/2uc7PaF 
This is BS!!!!! MUST B McCains version. HE BLEW IT UP DOING A WET START. DAD ADMIRAL SEALED HIS RECORDS. HE IS A LEGEND IN HIS OWN MIND
Ain't that the truth! He's 1 small POS!
Critical work here McCain.
Yet @SenJohnMcCain couldn't vote to REPEAL Obamacare
#McCainLIED


You have to visit our areas Rojava Kurdistan syrian Mr John McCain.
Sure why not act like you care about the military. If you truly care & act as if u r like us, why r you not going to the VA for care???
If John McCain weren't there this disaster would have never happened.
Great job, Senator!!!!
You caused it
If my ass is going to pay 700 a month for insurance your ass should help pay for it Mccain.
TRAITOR!!!!!
Please be the hero I know you are! Vote your conscience!
Do not vote for a bill you know is terrible and depend on Ryan!  Horrifying you think like this!   Cot no, please!
Please do not sell out the American people so that trump can claim a win. America deserves better healthcare legislation!
My uncle Thomas Bilyeu served & survived the #USSForrestal tragedy. Thank you for your service & sacrifice.
yet he lived on to later betray the citizens of this country... Shameful

But to vote "yes" under these circumstances - dead of night vote for a bill with no scrutiny that nobody wants - is just disgraceful.
This video was played for us in the USN.  To see how situations escalate and to show bravery under fire.  I still remember the event.
EVERYONE NEEDS TO RESEARCH JOHN MCCAIN AND SEE THE TRUTH ABOUT HIM. HE'S A FRAUD HERO AND A TRAITOR TO OUR COUNTRY! CHECK IT OUT. BIG FRAUD
The 50th anniversary of the USS Liberty attack by Israel that killed 34 sailors was on June 8th of this year. Why no resolution for them?
Reach across the aisle and do what most Americans want you to do.......FIX ACA
Stop with the cowardice trying to defer to Ducey on your vote on skinny repeal. It's disgusting. You should honor your commitment to vote no
How can u possibly vote for a bill that effects 1/6 of our economy, and throw millions off healthcare and u don't even know what's in it?!?
￼American Cancer Society said to vote NO! Call 844-432-0883 to vote NO!
You still have the opportunity to vote no on skinny repeal. Country over party! #LetUsLive
Senator McCain please put people lives above political party
#SkinnyRepeal is a new slogan for the same old trash heap of a healthcare plan from the anti-veteran @GOP.
The one you swore was set by Mexicans as a signal fire?!!? Crazy old man
Imagined if they had lived.  How much medical care would they have needed?  For life? #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid
And which direction were you running as the crew were running to save fellow shipmates? Hope you didn't get slowed down running to safety.
@senjohnmccain it's still not too late to do the right thing.  Dont like skinny bill? You can back up your words when vote NO.

Thank you to everyone at today's rally at @SenJohnMcCain's to say we WON'T go back to a pre-ACA world. If you couldn't come, CALL. 
I can not believe it has been 50 years. Many of the survivors were transferred to our ship the John F. Kennedy CVA-67.
As young sailors we learned the skills we would need from them. I remember ABH Krause & Rizzuto leading us in endless firefighting drills.
Is @SenJohnMcCain mentally stable? We deserve senator w/full brain capacity.
Batshit crazy seems to be a theme in AZ politics.
Yalanini skim orrrosbunun evladi
Wow. Even when diagnosed with brain cancer John McCain finds the time to issue a statement calling for regime change in Syria. Obama's hero! https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/888077917007339520 …
McCain gave weapons to ISIS, Was the Songbird of Vietnam, blew up the U.S.S. Forestal. Research the Traitor. Don't take his word for it.
Work with Democrats on healthcare.
Honor the American people and vote NO on this BS sham
That must be a bit awkward around McCain
Let's also take a moment to honor the 22 Million Americans about to lose their healthcare.
