Something @realDonaldTrump will never get Lol
He Sucks
What is unpatriotic? You and the Progressive Marxist Democrats who disrespect our Constitution and the American People. You have been outed.
Establishment award for establishment politicians.  What is a "Maverick"  doing there?   Ah well,  things are always what they seem to be.
Fake Democrat
It should be called the liars medal for traitors and scumbags.
Congratulations Senator. Good to see you looking healthy and great.


Narcissism at its best.
