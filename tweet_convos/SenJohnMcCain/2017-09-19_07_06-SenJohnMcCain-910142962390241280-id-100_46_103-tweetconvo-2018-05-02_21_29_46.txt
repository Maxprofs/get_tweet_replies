Attention Serial Killers.

Here is a chance to be really popular.
Back off Mccain, he has already declared he will vote against it
Nope
Why keep kicking someone thats on your side, Go after the rest of these nutcases
My post is not meant to condemn; but coax. McCain is on McCain's side. It's legacy time and he wants to mitigate his past political damage.
Dear Senator , what is Trump trying to say .. that he wants a war.   HELP . GET RID OF HIM . All he wants is death and destruction ...
What about these Navy incidents?
.... what I'm hearing is BIG GOVERNMENT
The only thing I want to see you do is repeal Obamacare. You promised, now you are betraying the trust of those who voted for you.
Thank you for the link. Please vote no on the health care bill. You saved so many with your last vote, so please vote no again. 
Healthcare? How are you voting? Will you &  @JeffFlake ignore your constituents again? Vote no.
#noGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyNO #SaveACA #SaveOurCare #ProtectOurCare Millions will DIEw/o HEALTCARE slowly, horribly. #FBR #TheResistance
Please Senator, I'm begging you, vote no on the healthcare bill.  I just finished radiation for breast cancer. This bill could kill me.
Regular order! Your only concern should be your word, not deadlines!
Do not let these corrupt politicians steal our healthcare.Do the right thing.
Please please vote no on the health bill. I am a fellow GBM survivor and I would be dead without healthcare. Please.
Please vote no on the Graham - Cassidy bill !
Watch you? Hell no. Go away.
Please help return the Senate to regular order - health care legislation needs to go through committee and not rushed through!
Please do not let this horrible health bill pass. You will be taking away health care from the neediest.  Please, let's work together .
INCIDENTS AT SEA? THEY ARE SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED AT YOUR HANDS ON THE FORRESTALL? YOU KILLED 137 SAILORS YOU DRUNK SONGBIRD!
They're reviewing you hot dog plane crash on the aircraft carrier. Hope you have to pay for that one! #rino
Please vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. Your constituents are counting on you
Son of Cain
You should be willing to extend the same privilege of healthcare to Americans that you enjoy yourself
U people r deplorable allowing the idiot threaten nuclear war on a Korea at UN meeting! Do something about him & stop trying to take HC away
Start tweeting about how you are going to PROTECT people from losing their healthcare, how you are going to stand up and do the RIGHT thing!
Senator McCain vote against this new attempt.  You knoe people with prexisting condition should not be put to death
Please don't vote for ACA repeal. This one's worse than the one you went to great lengths to vote against. Defend health care for millions.
Senator McCain we're counting on you once again to save the lives of millions by voting no on this pathetic bill.
Leave your position you've shown your not worthy of the it.
Respectfully,
FSF
From what I hear you need to take a hard look at the PACFLEET crew and vessel certification process.
In order to address the financial situation of the navy's needs, an audit will be necessary to do it objectively.
Bla bla bla
This tweet goes to show only thing that matters to John McCain is John McCain! He is your President start acting like it!
@SenJohnMcCain thank you for doing the right thing, even when it means going against your party.
Pls vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Continue to be mavericky!
https://amp.azcentral.com/amp/678704001  - you should read this!  Please don't kill millions of people!
Nope watching our President, not you!
Shut up McCain @potus is speaking to U.N. General assembly!
Also live Trump just threatened to annihilate NK. I hope both Navy and McCain are watching this
In the name of the people and Constitution of the US, the military deserves our full support, but damn it kill the Graham bill first. Need U
Hows your insurance working for you?
I remember a Navy safety stand down when they lost aircraft. They went out & played golf.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Please vote NO on that heartless disastrous health bill!

JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
Hey John, we could sure use your help on this Graham/Cassidy bill. I know he's a friend of yours, but this bill doesn't help America.
Thank you for your service to our country, you are a true hero, please do not vote to end ACA.
Sir we need your help again. Please vote no again for repeal ACA
All well and good but don't forget Americans need and deserve good healthcare covering pre exsisting conditions
Vote NO on Trumpcare!  Do the right thing!
Nope more important things to watch at the moment like the POTUS.  Not something you should have been dealing with the last 8 years.

Thanks for this link.  Also, please do not vote for or support Graham-Cassidy. You know it's wrong.
Why are you ok with a bill that would deny vets w/pre-existing conditions like PTSD ongoing healthcare? VOTE NO on #GrahamCassidy

Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions. 
Did you know that the FDA IS knowingly killing us . Ex: Cancer, Obesity Sugar diabetes and heart disease.
