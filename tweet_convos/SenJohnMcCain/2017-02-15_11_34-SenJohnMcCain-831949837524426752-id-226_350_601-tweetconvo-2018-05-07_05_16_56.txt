I wonder if @SenJohnMcCain has any position of authority where he could help stem Russian encroachment?
YOU SAID-RISING POWERS OF RUSSIA&CHINA?SHOULD WE NOT BUILD UP OUR MILITARY BACK TO IT'S STANDARD?????
Unforgettable
Thank you sir for your service!#RealHero
he is NOT a war hero! Pardoned for treason. Pow's called him "Songbird" SOROS Puppet
Removing Trump would be the first step in addressing Russian aggression.
All you want is to go to war with Russia 
Start with Flynn investigation.
Thanks for setting the stage Obama! He was a lousy President!
please sir, looking to you to hold POTUS accountable for treasonous acts w/Russia. Don't let our country down! We need you.
Another must read- Trump is taking your party down.. (is this ok with you?) https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/these-23-republicans-passed-on-a-chance-to-get-trumps-tax-returns/516768/?utm_source=atlfb …
Stop Obstructing Trump, instead assist him.
You did nothing to stop Obama.
you're trying to start ww3 you GEORGE SOROS SATANIST PUPPET! SATANIST NewWorldOrder traitor!
will probably get hit all at once by russia, north korea and china. thanks to the DC swamp Viva Trump
go take a nap John, stop trying to start a fight with Russia.
@VP @SenSchumer @SenWarren @SenSasse  and now we have Russian influence in the executive branch
#russiagate #Trump #Pence
The country expects Trump to get us into some kind of major war. Why?Because Putin controls him
WWIII will happen and i blame it on all of you in Washington that weakened our country
With the demise of the US on the world stage over the past several years, WWIII is on the way.
quit pushing it we will loose.
Impeach Trump before he gets us into World War III - please!!
So first trump is a russian agent working for russia now he wants to start world war 3
help us !
I respect Sen. McCain so much.  Q: Will our troops in S.China sea now be defending Trump's new hotel in China?
You sir are the one who is wanting a war, everyone knows it, stop blaming your President,
Your Chinese BFF and your Russian scapegoat, can we impeach a failed quasi war hero? Death to ISIS, #MAGA
- Good points in article, but it didn't address stress on volunteer Army and cost?
Yeah, china give trump a gift, he makes great deals, for HIMSELF. Now it's one china??
The McCain legacy ????
Please, sir, you seem to be the only Republican willing to recognize the risk of Russia's influence on our government. Help!
impeach him before he can distroy this country.
I have faith in you and your courage to do all you can to Investigate Trump ties to Russia.
What is that old saying "keep your friends close & your enemies closer" - we need to create less tension...
WRONG ON ALL COUNTS
<— GO AWAY!
that's a scary article. Thank you for standing up to @POTUS, he's a #traitor and stole the party's nomination.
How about you vote against Trump sometime? Hypocrite.
I have always believed in your integrity.But I cannot understand why you are not doing everything in your power to stop this.
not backing ... going straight forward with Russia as an ally. Wakeup. McCain
How on earth can we "check" Russia's rising power when they now run our country?  Independent inquiry now!
A vet who will be in his late 80s when this term is up risks nothing fighting--not just talking--for what is right. Do so.
.@SenJohnMcCain @RealGDT @BrookingsInst @ForeignPolicy Your party rules. Unless you investigate, things will get worse. Trump sold US out!
MUST READ! He's a traitor. You can stop this! You want to win this way?You know,WE know!
Neocon lackey @SenJohnMcCain still pushing Jewish Zionist PNAC Neocon agenda of Bob Kagan for #WW3: http://america-hijacked.com/2014/02/24/us-has-neocon-agenda-in-ukraine-russia-analyst/ …
US debt vs GDP 110%. Russia debt vs GDP 11%.@SenJohnMcCain 801/805 West Point.
.@SenJohnMcCain @BrookingsInst @ForeignPolicy What's ur game? Is it a long 1? B/c it's not working, it's making you look weak, sir. #Impeach
you need to investigate just what the hell is going on @ WH
I see it everyday in chat rooms, people do not understand what NATO is.
#China and #Russia are the dangerous countries that destroy world peace.
Senator McCain, the future of our country rests largely on your shoulders. Please don't let Donald Trump destroy America.
INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS TO WHITEHOUSE..FOLLOW THE MONEY..GET TAX RETURNS.
.@SenJohnMcCain ICYMI: We want an independent investigation into WH/#Russia, incl taxes. @artemis1954 @BrookingsInst @ForeignPolicy
You had your free lunch. Time is now up for your Empire.
Kagan is one of the craziest pro-war neocons out there. No thanks!
 @SenJohnMcCain @BrookingsInst @ForeignPolicy
My GOD!
Could you be MORE of a DRAMA QUEEN?
Possibly send them to their fathers?
What are you doing to immediately bring to justice Obama WH Intel operatives for criminal leaks to press!!!
Thank you Sen. McCain.  Don't want WWIII.  America deserves better.
The greatest check to China is our manufacturing capacity.  If we move it overseas, then what?
OK...SO WHY DON'T YOU BE A STAND UP GUY, AND CALL FOR TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION?
#invesigateTrump #revealtaxreturns #impeachtrump!!
We call our senators and representatives (sometimes daily). We need your help to get to the truth.
I am a Democrat. I am proud to have you looking out for our cherished and kind country, resources & freedoms
But you just said you have to back POTUS.  Confused.
@LindseyGrahamSC must insist on an independent investigation.Russian interference must be made public. Right to know
Thank you for backing a bipartisan investigation into the Flynn controversy.#withgreatrespect
do your job! Stand up to trump over Russian involvement!America needs you!
We don't have to read "Backing into World War III" We are watching it firsthand! #ImpeachTrump
yes, an important read. Thank you for your intelligent discourse on the threat trump poses
As opposed to you leading us into it?
GLOBALIST you want war with Russia to further the globalist agenda.  WARMONGER.
We know you would love WWIII that's obvious as every good attempt Trump makes you fight him on!
Incredible article, @SenJohnMcCain. Thanks! Are you breaking it down into 9 bulletpoints for you know who? He could use the help.
Is the rising assertativeness real or a matter of perception?
We the People need to see DJT Taxes. We need Free Press. Independent Investigation.  Remember Nixon.
Do your job! Insist on an investigation of Trump. #treason
why isn't anything being said about the Russian spy ship off the coast of Connecticut?
Yes! PLEASE put country before party! Stop the insanity of Trump & co.  AMERICA is NOT about his EGO!!!!!!!
-The battle is here in America, the battle is now. Wake up John. We are under attack. Take a Viagra and see if you can get up
I'm one AZ that is praying  you out of the senate! Drain the swamp
http://abcnews.go.com/International/russian-spy-ship-30-miles-us-navy-base/story?id=45507034 … LOOKS LIKE IT ALREADY STARTED! THIS IS WHY TRUMP STAYS IN FLORIDA
SO he can let Putin SPY. I CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE! #PUTINGATE
All the more reason for an independent investigation of Trump's connections to Russia.  Now.

"For the moment, he seems not to have thought much about the future ramifications of his rhetoric and his actions." How true.
Very interesting read.  Now...what do you aim to do to get us out of this mess?
probably not the best way to handle NATO.
we the people want term limits and voter ID.
if this happens it's not about Trump, it's because of both parties that r in it for themselves
#Russia & #Trump tainting highest office Republicans must investigate #Trump & vet prior to noms in future.
then protect us and do what's right
pretty obvious that Russia's sphere extends to @WhiteHouse and @realDonaldTrump . What will u do about it?
no time to read impeach Frump
another must read & your state should consider is http://koin.com/2017/02/15/oregon-bill-candidates-must-disclose-tax-returns/?utm_campaign=Contact+Quiboat+For+More+Referrer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=quiboat … <also,OR votes by mail should also be in place 4 US
is a George Soros puppet. Disgrace for all veterans.
Do you think the American people are in agreement on what we will are willing to got to war for?
This induces the embedded fear with everything going on today with Russia. Please investigate
Uh yeah WE SAID THAT ALREADY. NOW DO SOMETHING.

Cnn: Trump considering sending combat troops into Syria.
Excellent article. Helped me to understand the situation. We are doomed with Trump at the helm.
you voted for him. You saw the reports and you still voted yes. Why did you put us in this position?
wow you said something that I agree with amazing
What choice do we have? The republicans are giving carte blanche to Russia to take over our government.
Gosh.  May our so called president will take this recommendation!
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @BrookingsInst @JeffFlake  Crimea was taken over under Obama; Pres Trump NO appeasement of this takeover!!
Remember when FP wrote that well thought out piece on just how bad Trump would be as POTUS?
300 MILLION AMERICANS-NOT SUFFICIENT AMERICAN TERRITORY!
OLD HAWKS SOLD TO MILITARY INDUSTRY
Longest democracy in history Rome 300yr ours 240. We're counting you to get to bottom of this
Luckily it looks like China can stop Trump from going to war with some cheap bribes -- trademark approvals.
Do your job/investigate Trump .. he is neck deep in w/ Russia what is wrong you all
So weird how no one is interested in Russia violating a treaty
still waiting for town hall schedule sir....any updates..recess starts soon
@realDonaldTrump picture you and Lindseed riding a bomb down like Major Kong in Dr Strangelove!
@realDonaldTrump Yeah Senator Potter McCain,let's not back into it!Lets do 1st strike...woohoo!
You are the one in government. You need to do your part to keep POTUS from downgrading USA in world!!!!
And our foreign policy is in chaos/disarray. trump is unstable. WH admin is unstable. CORRUPT.
Asking the most corrupt senator to help is sad.He is a globalist and traitor
Don't be fooled.  McCain has been working against us!
Oh, he will definitely do it. He does what Soros tells him. He is a stinking globalist.  TRAITOR MCCAIN
traitors are people like you. Idiots who are party over country.
probably don't know the full reasoning as to why you all claim globalism is bad.
Why does everyone think that RU/JA casino etc will deflect from the real RU/CH agenda to destabilize dem co's
Achieving peace through strength means legally asserting American power and influence globally
Shame on you for posting such nonsense. You are unfit for duty Senator.
you want WWlll. No one but you and Graham and all the Neocons. Let other countries defend themselves, worry about Americans!
Great article. Thanks for recommending it.
comment WH being disfunctional Flynn resignation, you never stated the same about the resignations in Obama Whitehouse. Thnx
well you and Obama stated the Cold War , finish it , congress running government ,  you fix it
how about you goin all "maverick" instead of going with the flow. Country first, not party!
SenJohnMcCain- looking forward to you getting off the Trumpkin bus and voting your voice!
Who will read & explain this to the puerile, inept #POTUSApprentice occupying the WH?
I think you should keep a low profile and it will help you settle your heated imagination
He's not backing into it - he is driving full speed forward into it
Then why are you enabling this insane criminal and agreeing with his criminal appointees?
Oh, please.  You are preaching to a choir. Me must --> YOU must
dinasours please exit stage left.
Anyone can post articles. You have power and influence. Please use it.
save us @SenJohnMcCain
we definitely don't align on all things politics but I respect you so much as a true patriot.
we elected trump to fix things, he's trying help him
If you would join the #resist movement and help us oust #fakepotus WW3 wouldn't be such a possibility. MAN UP
who r u trying 2 fool?  You r a warmonger!This is exactly what u want!!
Congress must act Senator, including investigating ties between Trump administration and Russia.
U aren't doing anything to stop him. U should have crossed the aisle on DeVos+Sessions.
please stand firm and act on your tough retoric. Stop putting party before nation.
All talk, zero action.  McCain is not calling for independent investigation of Flynn.  Toady, panderer.
retire
History will remember the GOP for undermining our democracy and causing this
it would help if you would demand investigation to Trump's Russian ties.
please Please PLEASE stop Trump from destroying world
Senator, you are maybe the last patriotic and honest #GOP leaders in Senate. Please start full investigation on #Trumprussia
so Mr McCain you will be spearheading a bipartisan congressional investigation on trump admin?
Posting this stuff does not erase the fact that you do not stand up to Trump. He is the Russian threat.
Was Sally Yates fired because she wouldn't enforce ban,or because Trump wanted Sessions in ASAP to head off investigations?
This is frightening! 45 either doesn't know or care what his rhetoric is inciting! #impeach45
Senator, you are 80 and your legacy hangs in the balance. At what point will #WeThePeople see u take a stand?
please stand up and call for a non-partisan independent investigation into the Russian fiasco
what are you doing to stop this?
Well senator we are waiting for your plan rather then your words. Plans work way better.
on some level I think you find that exciting John McCain
When are you going to come out as the Democrat  you are?
YOU have been grabbed! Was it good? You liked it I bet.TRAITOR!
Read "Saul Slinsky's rules for radicals" & fight that - it's your immediate issue!! @POTUS
Who's side are you on?
he is on his financial side. Give weapons to foreign countries and expect it to go well#stupid
Yes! Sen. McCain,and I'm reading everything else ,except what I should be reading now.Being my CATHOLIC Bible!
TRUTH; Catechism of the Catholic Faith also; excuse me but I know Meghan has attended a girls Catholic School.
Senator with your guidance we will walk through front door. Oh I forgot your'e not @POTUS
you are our last hope in the Senate. Hope @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr can put #countryfirst
brilliant article, to many words for @realDonaldTrump. Lack of discipline places US at risk
There you go again - on the wrong page.. @realDonaldTrump is president, not you!! Get it??
I'm sure that would make you happy, McCain. You seem hell bent on war with Russia? How well will you profit?
.@SenJohnMcCain @BrookingsInst @ForeignPolicy  Please replace Trump with Pence.
That's great senator. How about you impeach him for AZ? All his colluding comrades too?
aren't we fighting the real war now- immigration. While you apologize to Australia about Trump.
How will the GOP destroy planet: war or unchecked climate chg? Either way we're screwed with you.
Yea and the world isn't going to fare very well with @POTUS (AKA Putin) Running things.
