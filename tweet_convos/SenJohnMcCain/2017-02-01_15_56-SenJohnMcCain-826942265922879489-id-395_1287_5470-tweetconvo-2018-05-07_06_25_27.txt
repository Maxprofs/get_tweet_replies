Because of you I can say that I do not hate ALL republicans. 
Our very democracy has a hull breach, but this made me smile. :-)

So are you jumping on the Trump train that CNN is fake news . you have lost the moral authority that being a POW earned you
Childish 894/899.

Revenge belongs to God, not you

@daveweigel @LaurieUreCNN @mkraju @CNN hey but good for you making a show about Tillerson then voting for him anyway.
@daveweigel vote no on DeVos
@daveweigel this would be charming if there wasn't a fascist takeover of our republic currently happening
that was funny! You and  @JoeBiden's should make a funny video!
Would you do that to Fox News?
Do not allow phoenix to be a sanctuary city. You will NEVER win another election here in Arizona again! #DTS! #MAGA! #BTW!
@BetsyDeVos We support Betsy 100%.Stay strong! There are FB messages on all the lib sites telling them to tweet and call you.
@am_larry @LaurieUreCNN @mkraju @CNN Well John, we can agree on something. Now get your butt to work and support the POTUS!
Haha! Sir, thank you for still having your sense of humor!  And... #noDevos #ResistTrump
@LaurieUreCNN @mkraju @CNN With all what's going on you do have to maintain a good sense of humor.
Love this. We need more humor. Here's a great idea - please don't vote for DeVos
that was funny now help reign in trump
No DeVos, but thx for a reason to smile in scary times.
DeVos: yes
vote yes for Davos!
Speaking of revenge... Trump was awfully mean to you. Vote no on DeVos and be the deciding vote!
Now you are acting like tRump.
still a coward still the opposite of a maverick.
so awesome Senator McCain!
you have the opportunity to become a true American hero once again. And it for our children.
Wonderful! Big NO to DeVos, please. Ask Cornyn for TX. Think we gave up on Cruz. :)
be a true maverick vote no on Devos! You know what should be done. #NoOnDeVos
smooth
I have respect for you and nothing to gain. NO for De Vos. I was 1989 school district volunteer of the year.
Glad to see you can be so glib when we just signed away the US to Russia today with Tillerson
that was funny Senator McCain.
Talk of war with China, Iran and Mexico. Major diplomatic damage in 1 week!
Trump is mentally ill.
Love it! Well done Senator!
that... was... hilarious.
Glad to see mobility in your arm!  Need more in your politics. Stop Trump! Save Rule of Law.
Turns out you may be human instead of just a person wanting more war.
Mr McCain, please support the US in not confirming the obviously unqualified Devos confirmation
In his 1st week he has alienated the world because of his insane agenda. Psychiatric evaluation needed.
You have my respect. Please vote against Devos. It's up to you McCain. The education of our children is the FUTURE of the USA
Is insanity not a reason to be rid of Trump? Not fit to lead is the consensus among many psychiatrist.
So, McCain does have a sense of humor. You don't see it when Vetrans are arrested at his office.
My favorite political event of the day.
Thank you for this moment of levity!  Much needed and appreciated.
@Ami_Marisol was that a "no" vote on Devos? Hope so!
Nice photo bomb. Long shot but vote no to Devos. unqualified. ruined MI schools, doesn't know education law, (IDEA). No Devos
Is this how you behave while about the people's business? Revenge? Just what I want to hear from the head warmonger in DC.
-I'm from Arizona- Do not accept DeVos as a Trump appointment. Do NOT accept Pruitt as a Trump appointment. Get out too.
please say no to DeVos!
Please vote against #BetsyDeVos . She lacks the qualifications, experience, knowledge of pedagogy,& compassion for the job.
that's great! Now, how will you remove #dangerous #crazy Trump from power?
liking you a lot more lately. But please vote no on Devos!
PLEASE vote NO to Betsy Devos, she is unqualified and risking the future of public education
funny
I  it!!
@mkraju 
May not agree w all ur positions, but have a feeling ur a great human being,I would buy an used car from you
So you're happy your party is violating the Constitution and making up its own rules? Revenge at the price of America,wow...
I am a Democrat, but this one example of why you are popular outside of your party. Hahahahaha!
@LaurieUreCNN @mkraju @CNN 
That's funny lol
you go Senator
stand up or retire. No on devos
Well Done!
