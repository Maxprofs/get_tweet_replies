Drones and border patrol and no wall. Take border wall $ and give to military to replace old equip and for training. We need best military!
IT'S THE MINIMUM, BASICS --- ADEQUATE TRAINING, ADEQUATE REST AND SLEEP. ADEQUATE TOP AND MIDDLE MANAGEMENT.
EMP shutting down Navy and Tanker remote control being hacked! Direct T-Bone to a STALLED McCain! Direct in then direct out no other damage!

What a Complete LOAD of Shit ! Whom ever wrote this has NO Clue about the Military what so Ever. Progressive McCain Please Retire . 
How U could Post such Dribble as Must Read is utterly Amazing . Computers were Hacked & You Know it Senator . Don't Blame the Volunteer Mil.
Judge for yourself read the story :
We need a new Commander in Cheif, one who cares about his troops.
Liar, SHILL! 1st
No disrespect Sir, but we didn't hear you complain when the previous administration made the defense budget their lowest priority.
1st
Not reading that 6th grade level rag, neither should you. Saw plot of Alnic http://gcaptain.com . Made 270 turn in shpg lane to hit USS.
U of all people speaking bout out Military. U stay awake thinking about how cowardly u was or the men that was still there? No probably not



#drivetheboats properly and #stophiringdrunks to #drivenacyboats and #blowupiran instead of letting them grab sailors
Yes they are! Under the last administration our military was underfunded and undermanned! Why weren't you so loud then? RINO #MAGA
They are sleeping behind the wheel!!
Seems to me that our ships are being rammed intentionally.
It seems each accident Navy ship gets hit in the same place on each ship. Sleeping quarters.  Seems deliberate.  
What's Amiss is Your Diligence
Just because You're a senator doesn't  exclude You from Blame
Anyone check out the failure rate of the sonic equipment on board ? Who actually signed off on those contracts ? Ask Yourself a question . Are You to Blame Sir ?



Please see you are
Rookies compared to @SenJohnMcCain 's July 29, 1967 WET START, 134 Killed, 161 Seriously Injured!
So say the Senator who has over sight. McCain gets all his assessments from NYT  or other publications never once has he referenced US. GOV.
WOULDN'T rule out Kim Jon or any foreign country who hates the US or Trump more...if Putin...reason..distract..Russia probe
I think the defense is hacked along with all electronic systems! The Chinese sent a satellite outside our global system believe it's hacked!
Thank you for sharing this Senator.
Everyone is nervous & thus mistakes as long as we have the menace in the WH masquerading as @POTUS. Pray for you & USA
pretty obvious
You had that tumor removed on the tax payers money but voted down healthcare, shame. You are a complete traitor to the USA.
Traitor because he didn't support a bill that was a disaster? You are ridiculous.
Health care bill Thst was a start and better than ocare.However more of a traitor for giving the viets secrets when captured and for working
With radical Islam
Maybe the Navy should stop advancing stupid people for their skin color and taking away from the smart ones.
Not quite a Forrestal fire eh?
Obama did all he could to make this shit happen, and no one did a thing about it.  You have the majority, and you can't do a damn thing
Send that boat to mothball now the tax payer will save money.
Almost as much damage as you caused on ur ship huh John!
Joe Arpaio is a patriot but you're a traitor
Impeach him!!!  Find something!!!
John you lave be politically correct ,
That is a sad state
What is your culpability for allowing the military Purge over the last 8 years.
Our Navy needs rebuilding & more support. We cannot put sailors under such strain & risk. Even if we reuse mothballed ships, numbers matter.
Dead man walking - whose side are you on... America? Or Russia?
McCain needs to call for a senate investigation into the POW's that were left behind in Viet Nam
# it time for warning?
# limit approximation to our war ships?
# hit two ship two months time is not acceptable?
# Protect  our marine, & F.
Career complete; crashed 3 planes, a destroyer, and healthcare
Russia? Might explain why WH hasn't said a word.
That is my guess or Japan.
Second guess or at large
We have left over problems from Obama. They stopped following wise decisions of the past.
We need to determine if American systems are hacked Especially the defense systems! Especially that!
Retire

SM break down too. S.66 should be included in raising the debt ceiling. Disabled Veterans deserve the it retirement.
Our brave men and women in uniform need someone guiding this American vessel known as democracy, who isn't an embarrassing traitor!
It's no coincidence that the so called Commander In Chief is at the helm while this is happening. Order and success comes from the top...
I agree with your point. However, don't underestimate the impact of leadership instability transcending through the chain of command.
so stop the "wars", quit using servicemen as profit generators.  Surely you saw enough of that in Vietnam.
It can't be a fluke that 134 sailors died and you run to save your own ads after you cause the explosion. TRAITOR, murderer coward liar
I believe these incidents are staged by Russia. How convenient we just had two each apart from one another #cripleamerica
Yeah!!! What he said!!! #WayToPressOn #GoodSoldier #MyHero
@realDonaldTrump
... and we're going to waste  $40 billion on a stupid wall?
Well-said.
@RepDanDonovan clearly trans in military not the real issue that needs to be addressed, unnecessary drama and distraction
We wasted so much money on the LCS & DDG-1000 that could have been spent on simple frigates or Arleigh-Burkes.
Services are not ready.  Operational readiness reports are a sham.  Show me one cmdr who will put himself on report for not being ready.
Bring back the draft!  All citizens should serve. Society would benefit hugely! Not all have combat but basic training would dampen outrage.
As long as we can get enough volunteers we are better off with a force with people who want to serve.
less regulation from Trump is my guess.

We can't trust any republican in word or deed
Yes focus on safety / taking care of people vs out of control spending such as the F-35 program. $1.5 Trillion dollar program.
Contact military and tell them they need to also investigate close-calls In their search for root cause
This is going to be expensive but US foreign policy has decided this path. Diplomacy is cheaper & costs fewer lives. But can u change course
In the upcoming budget company tax will be slashed. A big military spend is a very slow if potentially nonreturnable spend. You'll be broke
By mid 2019. The expected infrastructure investment windfalls have not been sold cause weak leadership. soon will be facing a budget crater
And people will look at that wall and  they will be angry as hell so why waste the money?
8 years of operational budget cuts. Its not that hard to understand-when the navy does not maintain at-sea proficiency, bad shit happens.
McCain you were in office when Obama gutted our military. You are shameless snake to be backing & posting this now.
@usatodayDC  He downsized our military to its lowest since before WWII. Google articles
I read it, senator.  This ugly road to shipwreck started with the so called "Peace Dividend"  Dems used to funnel mil $ to social programs!
Yes. A must-read. Thank you, Sen McCain.
I wouldn't serve on anything bearing anyone from that traitor's families name.  Go back to bed @SenJohnMcCain we will take it from here.

McCain you are snake w/nothing to lose. A traitor-it is impossible to become a rich politician unless you do favors
Thoughts and prayers to our military men & women...great Americans...true heroes...as are you.
RETIRE!
Rumor has it these ships play chicken with other ships.  Any truth?
Yeah, I'm sure that's it. Playing chicken with multi million dollar ships and hundreds of lives. Your a genius.
Russian or Japanese
THIS IS FUCKING TERRORISM. WHAT IS TRUMP NOT TELLING US?
Thanks for your service but now your letting you personal hattered for Trump impair what's is best for Americans! Retire!
@SenJohnMcCain Hello John how are you today ? I hope to be very healthy and happy. I have questions for you..
Good article, thank you for sharing
Sounds like what Trump said last year
Maybe lowering corporate taxes would help?
John McCain, the weasel who has made a career lying to his constituents (healthcare and immigration) then selling out to special interests
LoL
hope u r ok after accident, but u r not boat. navy probly shud use boat 2 avoid fewtyur crash. how u get thos guys in u btw? #maga #trump
Great read!
When you say "dangerous shoals" is that code word for "@realDonaldTrump is out of his mind?
Those ships were hacked.
