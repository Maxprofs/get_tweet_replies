Appreciate our service men, not to sure about John and his motives
When you shook their hands did you say, "son, thank you for your service and your sacrifice, especially your reduced medical benefits." ?
No he doesn't . Repunks encourage wars, but donf't know how to take care vets.

And when they struggle when they get out, at least they'll have an inadequate tax credit 4 health insurance.  #SaveMedicaidSaveLives
Agree we can't thank them enough.  Question is why did you put them in this position?  You should worry about Arizona and let Mad Dog handle
He didn't do it. It was a couple of Presidents back.
We can thank them by making American SANE again. Oppose Trump's arrogant, ignorant administration. Don't be an enabler.
Trump is anti war anti US opium trafficking. Ur a sic person supporting thieving US tax $ 2make bankers corps military Indus complex richer
Good Job! That's what you should do with our outstanding troops!  Stay away from the leaders unless you're delivering a message from  @potus
Thank you for watching over & carrying for our troops.
Now if U would support your Pres, the man who is finally putting service people up front. He's better than your Dem friends.
Do you realize who you're criticizing?#always a hero# unafraid to do the right thing
NOTHING can make up for being "the Canary" #Traitor

Senator McCain is very thankful he would run out of opium otherwise.
But a good start might be by making sure troops and their families have access to health care.
PROUD TO BE AMERICAN, I AM
however, do not consider Subversives as Americans too. I would never go to War for the Democrats agin>AWOL McCAIN
Thank you for going Sir. On the way back please talk to Senator Warren about healthcare and the economy. She is kinda smart
Remember that nasty evil Obama and what he used to do this time of year for service men...
President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama always had a picnic for military families every year on July 4th. 
What is that green flag represent?
are they ready to die in North Korea Trump is on the move
As an Arizona Native, I recall you visiting my ship, when you discovered I wasn't in your district you snubbed me.
Proud of our men and women in the service.  I wonder though...did we we have to be there?
well done sir!
Get out
yes.
Get them out of there!
Waaaay too long, waste of $$ and life
@SenJohnMcCain is very good buddies with a ...well, @georgesoros
Thank you for your service!!
Thank you for your service.
They have sacrificed lives for your opium trafficking operation. Opium production has increased 800% w/ us illegal invasion using US tax$.
Yes,it is a right thought  - we can't thank them enough for their sacrifice.
Nothing more telling than this photo of Sen. McCain thanking our troops while @realDonaldTrump hides on the golf course. Again. #truepatriot
Let's thank them further by bringing them home for good.
More pandering. People look behind curtain. @SenJohnMcCain has been bought off by Trump- who daily puts ur lives in danger w madman antics.
Yes we can, by giving them the medical/mental care they deserve without cost to them or delay.

#MAGA #25thAmendment
We could thank them by bringing them home!Good paying jobs,decent place 2 live & good healthcare 4 them & fam .Now that's 1 damn good way!
Please honor that sacrifice by assuring that their Commandor in Chief is fit to serve. #DeclarationOfIndependence #Constitution
And #potus45 is playing golf again! Priorities!#all in for the military!
Thank you for representing America you are doing a professional job with leadership and role modeling
Sen. McCain:  You're an American Hero, but are silent as FRAUDPOTUS wrecks our country.  You should have been president in 2000.  Help now!
Please stop everything you are doing. The POTUS is unstable and has the nuclear codes. Nothing more imprt than stopping him
Nice to see you making slightly more sense than when you came to Senate Intel hearing to question Comey hammered!
Only a psycho like McCain would call seeing troops in harm's way "wonderful." What would really be wonderful is to bring them all home alive
You should be on the ranch.  Retired.
Fixing the VA after years of substandard treatment is a start; you could have done more a lot sooner.......just saying
God bless our troops everywhere, and god bless John McCain
shame on you!   your sence of freedom is as pale as your face.
#HappyBirthdayAmerica Dad & I in his F-4. Proud of ALL who continue 2 keep OUR beautiful country FREE in ALL ways#FreePress #FreeSpeech
30 years of dishonorable & failed wars.  The Military overwhelmingly supports the no-war guys like Ron Paul & @realDonaldTrump
Yes U could begin #impeachment NOW!  If U want to thank them out Country B4 Party Traitor!
Shut up and stand down. Old fart!
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 Thank you to ALL of the men & women serving in the U.S. Armed Services! #THANKYOU b/c of you we have #Freedom <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
It would be much better seeing you at home answering the tuff questions about healthcare.
A man with no balls
Thanks to them and thank you for being there Senator McCain.
Served with better ending than you
Why deny them?

Amen !
