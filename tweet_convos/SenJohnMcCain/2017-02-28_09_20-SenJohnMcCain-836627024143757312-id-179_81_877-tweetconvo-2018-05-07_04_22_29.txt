So Sad that you work for Military Industrial complex, take money from Saudi Royalty and other foreigners. We see you
Didn't know the American Legion rewarded treason.  Tricky Dick Nixon screwed Amerika when he pardoned your POW sellouts.
You Are Now Coming Close To Becoming Traitor 4 Way You Treat Our Potus We The People R Going Vote U Guys Out of Office next
.@SenJohnMcCain As a vet, I know you know Trump was wrong to pass the buck for his botched Yemen raid. Do your job.
leftists love @SenJohnMcCain
you deceived us, senator. You work for Soros, if not, return his money and make public @SenTedCruz @GOP @POTUS
I just finished your book "Faith......." all your awards are well deserved!
you fooled him McCain. No surprise u have been fooling Arizonans for decades. Sorry I ever voted for you
nice now step up and get Trump's Taxes and the independent prosecutor for the Russian issue. This is not going away!!!!
we are honored by your service!
do they know about your Saudi ties and your treasonous leaks to the press to further Hillary Clinton agenda?
McCain is a decorated vet. Have some respect.
He needs to work with his party. Instead stands on his war hero laurels. Yawn.
Great point, Deb!
what a joke! 

Seriously @AmericanLegion? Awarding the #CanaryofHanoi? For what? Arming terrorists in Syria?
I've been  American Legion member for 48 years. I'm now resigning since they honored someone that won't support his President
songbird sang, Nixon did a blanket pardon!
very well deserved sir. You are a hero & will always be a hero. #American are lucky to have you. Thanks a lot.
you are no hero using Navy SEAL Ryan loss of life to forward your political agenda. He was a hero God bless him & his family
But YOU were called out in front of all America for claiming raid that killed Ryan Owens in Yemen was NOT a failure.
You deserve it...just wish you would step up and lead again.
hope u received PresTrumps message today!If u r goin2continue being a warmonger Its time2retire.
CONGRATULATIONS
even though you sold put your friends in Vietnam?
Who'd you pay to get that?
Congratulations Senator McCain, it was truly an honor meeting and chatting with you.
Why, after you insulted a fallen warrior hero's death and his family?
Just collect you awards and your paycheck. That's all you're good for anymore. You sir have proven to be a disappointment.
Stop congratulating yourself and start supporting OUR president. Your are a shameful backstabber from what I can tell. stop
I hope my husband withdraw his membership, you don't deserve it!
Congratulations! You deserve it.
Not on my watch.  McCain's mission failed.
time to earn a lifetime award. Speak out against Trump, few can and carry weight. Speak out...please.
You deserve something alright... Fake Republican.
You laugh. Will you vote against the President's budget to keep the military from being strengthened. No joke - support Trump
Senator, it is great, you deserved it !
bashing a sitting president isn't very distinguishable neither is begging for Russian donations then claiming collusion
. Congrats!
Congrats. Now time to fight the Russian in the White House. #MakeAmericaAmericaAgain 
Congratulations
Take the award because soon you'll have the "honor" of shame & prosecution for UR coverup of WH corruption. What R U hiding?
You have earned this award and others many times over for your service to our country.  Thank you Senator McCain.
John McCain, you are awesome.
oh Horseshit

In it for the rewards I see. #TimeToRetire
Please support President Trump!!!!
To bad it wasn't your retirement paperwork.

Remember Ike warned about the military industrial complex you are promoting.

I'm sorry you've been so disrespected by #45 for your wartime service.  This granny appreciates you!

Congratulations

Senator, please tell the American Legion that Trump claimed he had a heel spur to stay out of the military in 1968
