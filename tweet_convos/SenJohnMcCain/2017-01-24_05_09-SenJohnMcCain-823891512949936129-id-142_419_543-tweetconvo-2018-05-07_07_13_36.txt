- WHY don't any of you #GovOfficials stand up for what IS good for our Nation for a change.
I wholeheartedly agree
we lose more jobs by leaving TPP.
Trump is mad he really needs stopped before we are at war
China will also get into Mexico. That's to close to the US.
McCain added, "but I must remain true to my president coz that's what's most important. I won't oppose a vote
You have overstayed your welcome in Congress. Time to retire. America needs that from you now.
You really don't get it. Your friends the NWO globalists are destroying this country. Cease and desist.
Isolationism supported by POTUS weakens America.  Stop his harmful words and actions.  Good job Sen. McCain
Has POTUS making bad decisions affecting America!!!
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain McCain would gladly ship more of our jobs away just like past trade deals...
time to man up Sir, Arizona Native, glad my dad is dead he voted for you over and over!
Many trump followers say this is good. We'll see as time goes on. We r isolating rselves from the world
you just want to take all american jobs away what do you gain from it.
We will survive and prosper without TPP.
Perhaps sharing more details w/ the People instead of keeping the TPP behind doors would've been wise.
From the workers' perspective, a trade deal like this means jobs going bye bye overseas.
But it's good for Trump. Mark my words: he has business there that will benefit. #RESIST
can u retire please??
@POTUS will end up tanking US economy
Check McCains bank Account @FBI I bet you'll find Chinese payments.
Easy to predict this - Long live isolationism  #didntworkoutwelllasttime
Maybe you should switch not just to MSNBC but to the Democratic caucus if you can't support our President.
TPP is a top 2% goldmine supported by establishment GOP like McCain Middle class revolt = Pres Trump GOP changed forever All on board McCain
McCain is a JOKE
Its all about POWER!
YOu know what else is not good for US? TRAITORS WHO LET RUSSIANS STEAL OUR DEMOCRACY. McCain is that traitor.
Let the Chinese do what they want. The TPP was bad for Americans. Face reality.
But the same pig who denied your war effort got all his cabinet approved and screwed us on TPP. 2 DUMB 2 RULE
step up you know what's right regardless of you party affiliation do the right thing
U know  when the chips r down U will fold to POTUS just like on Tillerson. Please b the man we know U can b
@denisedurakpsyd
but stood with Rex. Scared of Trump tweets about him votes for Russia not for America. Disgraceful
Let them negotiate, its not bad to stir up a bit of healthy fear to bring parties to the table.
what billion dollar companies have u run
LOSER, good luck staying in 
office.
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain I have always been leery of them
Mr. McCain you are a senator for many years You are not a businessman Get over yourself DJT is POTUS!
Stop interfering with our President, u are irrelevant, we did not elected you what part of that u don't get?
Corp America will soon understand "America First" = "America only", impacting their global market & profits.
7 yrs to put deal together @realDonaldTrump what do you thinkwill buy from  that we can't get from  
#JUSTSHUTUP!
John why r you hell bent on handing over USA 2 Globalism ? #Globalist Say no to #Globalization #MAGA
would u please quit grandstanding ur ideas have been rebuked by the American ppl..ur time is over
@LizMair @SenJohnMcCain Trump is God's most terrific deal maker. Who needs APAC trade if you can build casinos in Russia?
is that why the "great" Trump declared bankruptcy 6 TIMES?????? 
You still can trade in South China Sea, John!

Here's the map:
@nandrews90
Absolutely 100% correct. US has shot itself in the foot on this one.
Trump is as shortsighted as he is stupid!
if you live in AZ like I do an know John he is wrong again
he knows nothing about trade
thank you Senator McCain for having a spine and not thinking in black and white terms on this complex issue!
@LizMair @SenJohnMcCain  the "Art of the Deal" is quitting
It may not sound economically HEALTHY at dis stage. But Chinese cheap use n thro need 2 b replacd by US goods
well with the US killing trade deals and china taking them
In due course US biz community will b forced 2 b innovative and cum up wit ways to flourish.
Serious question, why don't we see more Democratic Party members being interviewed?
because they actually support Trump's policy on TPP.
More like they don't get the right information. http://mediamatters.org/research/2017/01/10/study-major-wisconsin-newspapers-failed-contextualize-impact-aca-repeal/214954 …
there's people now that don't have ins. and would rather pay tax fine because it would still be cheaper
There's millions more of us who will lose with pre-existing conditions gone, lifetime cap gone, kids on to 26
Senator McCain was also in favor of NAFTA and the Dreamer Act, he puts Americans last. We're suffering!
TPP, nor other behind closed doors agreements, isn't a trade deal.
TPP, TISA & such agreements eliminate citizens' rights, kill off SMEs & siphon off national funds.
Does Trump even know the content of TPP?
He blasted it way way before he had access to it.
Chinese has been negotiating RCEP & other such foreign investor protections for a few years now
Firmly believe,Trump is right, we were headed 4 a third world country, where the top 1% thrive & no middle.
the only why to read the TPP was to go to a special reading room in the Senate basement! Open govt not!
However, jobs leaving the US via NAFTA leave this nation w/o the means of earning a living to support buying.
if the TPP was so good for the US why was not the complete text (5,000) pages not released to the public?
Americans R retail whores.  We are the largest market in the world.  That should be enough trade incentive.
@lhmist @SenJohnMcCain The TPP wld have destroyed US sovereignty w/ an Intl org surpassing the authority our Constitution!
Problem is, everything in my house is made in China.  China is not in TPP?  Missing the problem.
Med Mod Act gave drug mfgrs a monopoly against Medicare, and half of congress was against.  Criminal!
Y don't we use a 2/3 vote to pass laws & acts?  Med Mod Act pass 213-218, it was a crime against seniors!
I guess you are never to old to switch sides.  Congress seems to choose money over duty & country.
I know U R  a war hero, but the deals U make 4 America, make U look like a sell out! TPP, NAFTA & Dream Act.
We already have trade deals w TPP countries,@SenJohnMcCain
TPP mainly added corp-overrule-govs court @CBSThisMorning
"The Chinese are now negotiating their own version of TPP… not good for the US." -- @SenJohnMcCain on Trump’s withdrawal from TPP 
China did not join the TPP.  So what's your point? They would go their own way anyhow.  TPP not good for US!
You just want your war!
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain If it was such a good deal Johnny Boy, why didn't you insist that Obama send it to Congress?
https://twitter.com/ChriStylezz/status/823635384672382976?s=09 …
Proof Trump is abusive to his wife!
Can y'all please look at Melania face when Trump turns around  
http://www.globalresearch.ca/washington-accuses-russians-of-bombing-five-hospitals-in-syria-state-department-refuses-to-provide-evidence/5557475 …
McCain just lost many of his lobbyist. He is part of the SWAMP and is crying as he is going down the drain!!
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain it'll be the best trade deal in the history of trade deals! Wait, how will we benefit?
YUP China will be selling Weapons to TPP countries! YOUR #WarProfiteer clients Lose. I could not be happier!
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain Go away.
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain McCain go take your meds and zip-it!!!
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain 
The #globalist #agenda seems really important to a global elite senator
Do America a favor, join the Democratic Party. Your RINO policies is why America is in such terrible shape
I'm all for this, along with enough members to tip control of the senate to the Democratic Party.
Democratic party? seriously? The racist Democratic Party that hates Whites?
Walter is full of shit and a liar.
That doesn't change the fact that you're full of shit and a liar.
#GOP#killing ourcountry
@katiecouric Norah, "But what about Baden getting his precious bowtie?" @joebiden
thanks for continuing to serve our country... we need #TPP without all the bad junk that was in the original.
should ask @SenJohnMcCain if Flynn has the same views as his? What about Flynn pushing #FakeNews 
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain 
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain enough of the old regime, this was and is great news for the American worker, not some old regime
DON'T say yes to Trumps cabinet. Can't "drain the swamp" inviting Goldman Sachs & oil to rule the nation.
Corrupt conniving liar McCain is totally out of touch. Park him on the sidelines. Put a cork in him
if yu know so much about the TTP do tell please
Sean Spicer said it best yesterday. Maybe you can get someone to read transcript to you.
no i am not into alternate facts   the TTP was a trade deal that left out china
I don't accept your facts. Left lib progressive climate 'facts' are fake facts. 'Facts r stubborn things'
are you telling me you dont know what TTP was  well shit read it
Hey shmuck, Obama locked it away so nobody could read it. Even you.
LOLOLOL would you like to read it
To be fair..the US version was quite shoddy and rife with allowances for copyright trolling.
@LizMair @SenJohnMcCain "who cares? At least trump is doing what he said he was gonna do"

- idiot trump supporters
Pretty sure this is how Trump and his administration operate act first - think later. 
#MakeAmericaLast
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain Wow... the United States really does want to go back in time. How were the 1930's? Oh... depressing
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain McCain no longer has a perty to align with. Hes proven to both sides hes corrupted
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain @realDonaldTrump @POTUS will destroy our economy on purpose
@odeedee
I am afraid McCain has become a leftist while posing as a Republican.
no just because he's a Republican don't mean he has to agree with this idiot
I would hope he would agree with managing our own trade.  Name calling:  Lack of ??
What he can do is no action but being afraid of.
The TPP prevented the US from properly managing our trade, and gave the US little control.
@CBSNews @SenJohnMcCain of vourse they are.  China will be the economic power in the pacific.  Why would they not ?
Recall #Obama s pivot to the Pacific that essentially gave it to china?
@realDonaldTrump America last
So your solution is to do a deal that is bad for the USA just so that China doesn't do it?  WOW...great strat
Sad to see this from you: complain about DJT, but not actually oppose him. That's called whining. It's weak.
was shocked that McCain betrayed US and MOSTLY HIMSELF. "Did he ever know he WAS a hero"
Seems like we just ceded control to China.  How is this in America's interest?  Improve it!
Here's a clue- it's great for transglobalists and the elites but catastrophic 4 U
thanks for the clue. But if we sit on the sidelines we cede control to China.  MCGA!
we should have improved it, not walked away
I am so over mcCain Angry guy who is against anything POTUS will do Retire.
Blindly following is not a democracy, that's a dictatorship.
P.O. Because he can't push think tank lobbyists pocket filling policies and RINO's with this Administration
we know congress didn't write 1 word but their lobbyists did .
@realDonaldTrump assumes the world will just end without US but the rest of the world will go on
@PaulaEbbenWBZ @SenJohnMcCain If @POTUS doesn't figure out a better pacific trade plan quickly, hello recession ~2019.
Do you really believe that?  Why is it Obama hadn't sent it to Congress?
I cant speak for Obama/Congress. I understand there were flaws w/in PTT...
but theres flaws in all negot'd deals. IMO we need an A-Pac
deal or #screwed
You can make deals one on one, each country has its own uniqueness/needs.
one-on-one deals should they fail leave you or US with little or nothing.
You make a deal with one then build on it, like a brick house
Ill respectfully disagree. IMO success frm partnerships is a better strategy.
Without global economy America will be left behind. China and Russia are going to lead.
agree with u economists do.trump's supporters r against globalism. We'll see how that works 4 them.
Yea for Trump
Embarrassing. Condemns Russian atrocities while deflecting Flynns and Tillys ties with them. #retire
the main stream media fails to understand that old-and-busted RINO McCain does not speak for today's GOP
, so that's automatically a bad thing?
Who said he spoke for entire GOP? Nobody.
Nothing about him is good for the US
