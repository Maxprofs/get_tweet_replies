The pic reminds me of the USS Cole.
@USNavy @WSJ Reminds me of #USSLiberty too where the Israeli torpedo hit!: http://www.ussliberty.org/gifs.htm  #USSJohnSMcCain

Or? Are the Russians spoofing Allies GPS systems?
Maybe it has something to do with this

Sir, will you repent for making the hanoi Tapes and throwing america under the bus during NAM? you are no war hero - but a coward - Repent
Answers for the families!
These sailors are still missing
 We need information. #PrayForThe10 
End the sequester, fund repairs, maintenance, spares and training.
We need to stop being the world's police & leave areas to force local govs to step up their investment! @US7thFleet @thejointstaff
YES !!
TY Our POTUS has Axis: Personality Disorders They can't be tx'd only get Worse! We are all in Harm's Way. I know how in mil unfit how POTUS?
Could it be RUSSIA HACKING our radar? I can't believe that the navy is responsible for these collisions.
As far as I know the Russians can't hack the MK-1 Eyeball navigation and proximity alert system. "Watches" are called that for a reason.
Well,  please explain to me how the proximity alert didn't work? Did they ignore it? I think not
That's for the investigation to examine and find out. Could be lack of training. Could be bad leadership. Could be something else.
One aft watch and two forward watches sleeping on post. A conning officer whom is blind and everyone else on the bridge. Even with a radar.
If that's true... it would point to a complete meltdown of basic discipline. That would be a true crisis of leadership.
I served in the navy on a ship. To me thus incident looks like it was orchestrated. You can't have 15 blind eyes at the same time.
I think right the current rumor is that McCain lost steering power. She apparently was able to sound collision with two minutes warning.
This is a message that Judgement of God has come to your house. REPENT and cumble yourself and call on Jesus Christ to forgive you
yes.
President should've mentioned sailors.Chant about you was awful.TY for saving my self emp husbands health care.we him. you are hero.bewell
Sounds like our past administration didn't properly train our Navy personnel. Glad Trump is here to change this! MAGA!
Congress (and the American people) need to make a fundamental decision- fund the force adequately or cut back global commitments.
Actually of comments read ur make most sense-cant have it both ways. USA always wants tax cuts but scream/cry bumpy roads & Bridges fall.
They've been trained but most of them are advancing on the coat tails of a smarter sailor. The system is flawed.
Looks like something you did .
Be ashamed to bring up the navy, you are a no vote. U will get a "no" vote.  Gone gone
You Little Johnny committed Treason
What is going on here? Don't we have technology to prevent these things from happening? Do we need to make better maps? What's up?
The Navy's 2nd McCain moment
This is very serious !!
Doesn't cost a extra penny to stand a watch. Where was the night watch?
RINO!!!  U aren't going to Rally cause u would have been booooooooed so loud yo great great great grandparents would hear it!
Excellent points from the author.

I don't think so.

McCain wrecked many fighter planes and killed 133 Americans in Vietnam on the USS Forrestal.
@WSJopinion good read, it makes sense,we'll see.
May I offer some very low tech advice? Could we have someone on board look out at the sea once in awhile to see if anything is in the way?
As a retired naval officer, I reject McCain for his lack of substantial support for Navy! He's likes the limelight far more than serving us!
Hope you're feeling better Senator, and giving that cancer hell
Thank God we have a President who sets Our military First. To many years without.
You may remember our lab then based in AZ. R&D now mature--our HumCat offering directly applied to these events: http://www.kyield.com/technology/humcat.html …
My theory we care too much about PC not hurting feelings and accepting everyone and are losing focus on the mission.
hackers jamming computer guidance system & navy not training sailors to operate the ships without computers?Basic operating skills needed
Sobering.
Remove Arlington cememtary .. plantation of Robert E Lee ..
Its so sad.. we vote all you politicians in & you do nothing.  You allowed our military to be stripped down to nothing. Even now.. Nothing!
I count back 10 incidents.  Fleet has shrunk, the "best" have been concentrated? Not enough money to support so many "fronts"?
the amount of $$ US spends on defense,multiples of any1 else, points to incompetence at the top & corruption by elected
Dear John, 
The pres. (small P) found your vulnerability. Go compare notes w/ Cruz, Christie, Sessions, Gingrich...
Thanks for your service.
Is this just an accident  or this is related to the China-india conflict? To much coincidence,simply cargo ship can't approach this warship
Great article!Full funding needs to be restored so full refit and training can happen!
Interesting article.  Well worth following.
You are a liar.
Would not Obama have taken 100% of the blame for this? Trump just gets panned for a tone deaf response
pushed into the sea of political obfuscation, dying for The State, brainwashed to sacrifice their lives for false gods of material excess.
Obviously we are having a problem with SIRI on the high seas.
Time to retire traitor
RINO
On them ships now there's two of them if they were the enemy ships you wouldn't know it before you would blow them out ofthe water it's test
Roulette chips get too close to ours we let ships get too close to the United States we let Subs get to close and may are dangerous to us

Sir, Congress needs to end sequester... and properly fund our military. This makes the Pres Carter year cut look planned
Nobody wants to hear fromyou songbird.  According to wikileaks you was bought and paid for by the clinton foundation.  #Worthless
No, they are not......they receive all of the sensitivity training they need....I am 37 years Navy retired.
Lets talk about your Nazi...is it Moment or Long History?
Leadership in DC is junk.
Have you looked at ketogenic diets yet with doc?  Please like this so I know you've seen & can quit bugging you!  
Your so vain... it's not all about you
The USN has had a few McCain disasters. Retire.
If you're not calling for mass resignations at the top of the @USNavy you are protecting incompetent old cronies.
God is awesome, and he Loves us so much! Walk in God's Love always!
Y were u pardoned
Yes John. Highly possible.
Karma for what you did out of SPITE!
