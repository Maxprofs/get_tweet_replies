You are the oldest sitting Senator & u know what Bill Clinton did with NOKO & what Obama did with Iran!! The same !!
Just wait Senator till Iran gets the N-Bomb , those mullahs will nuke the Jews & Palestinians like the German Holocaust ..
Jews have nuke too and a long time
And they don't have rallies promoting daily that they're going to bomb and destroyed and annihilate Iran off the map
Yes, but it doesn't mean they haven't plans to bomb, destroy and annihilate Iran, who talk much, do less-rus proverb)))))
If Iran lunches a nuclear warhead into Israel; I assume they would send one right back & maybe quite a few more more-
Martha, you forget, iraniens are muslims and have to reflect braveness and "to be more holy then Rome Pope",president Rauhani is not idiot..
If #McCain hadn't created this @POTUS #Russia nonsense by turning over the #Fake #Dossier we could be paying attention to business 
For the 10000000th time PLEASE RETIRE
So what else should we do? Bomb them? We don't need another war
Exactly some of these people on here R freaking me out;they want2bomb theout of NK! WH admin got entire security council 2approve sanctions
Mccain="I love war and bombs"
A little bit from me : war, bombs and money))))))
Isn't it time to retire now??U talk about Pres.Trumps language!! Bomb,bomb,bomb,bomb,bomb Iran!The warmonger era is OVER!
@SenJohnMcCain needs to be replaced with a republican, he is obviously a Liberal
McCain...I don't really care for you. You betrayed the GOP and sided with the Democrats.  We have the ACA because of you.
He sides with his conscience, which is fairly bipartisan. I respect him for that even if I don't agree with everything.
His ad when running for Senate was to repeal. He lied. Never liked him...research S&L scandal
Repeal even if it means the American people would be worse off under the new plan? We want things to get better, not worse.
Of course we want a better plan. The plan they laid out was not better! Who's the dope? Try using some punctuation next time, Ace.
No, @SenJohnMcCain - WaPo is garbage. We are SICK of republicans eating republicans. We look like IDIOTS. HEALTHCARE - N KOREA - GROW UP!
#washingtonpostfakenews
Again, war mongers like John McCain and Lindsay Graham made a real mess of Iraq and Syria.  Did u see how Syria has improved under Trump?
What do you suggest?
It's never enough war for you.
So when the Nazi where mass killing just walk away. Don't get involved? Some men should not have nukes and Kim jun Un is one.
I trust the President's judgement. I don't think N.Korea will result in war.
Sir, WHAT (if anything) to do-to STOP potus from "fire & fury"  nuke attack?

Didn't find post-nuke info on AZ emergency FB page; resources?
U need to QUIT second guessing @realDonaldTrump & team's handling of the portly NoKo runt. Admiration once felt is rapidly dying.
McCain, traitors don't support their President, they get on the media to push their liberal views.
Is it really alright that Trump gets his intel from Fox. Must likely leaked by Jared, Ivanka or another staff trying to protect him
Have you seen anyone congratulating POTUS on the NK outcome? Apparently his rhetoric was what situation called for, far from escalating it.
Volunteer your family members to be on the front line
How DARE you say the US isn't ready for n.k. threats! Resign, and do it now, before you enrage the base who elected the pres. you hate!
"Not enough," then you criticize the President's threat of "fire & fury" as too much. You're a bitter fool.  GO AWAY already...

You've in Senate for years. Never said a word about previous admins poor handling of NOKO. Suddenly you have answers to NOKO. Doubt it.
We need to be taking the "fire and fury" rhetoric down many notches. We do not need another endless Asian war, esp not one involving nukes.
UN continues to fail miserably. What will you & other representatives do to correct this situation?
Really that's more 15-0 vote than you and your advise to 4 presidents have ever done. But keep speaking like you have all answers! Lmaooo
When is Congress going to impeach this lunatic?We know this is a distraction tactic to divert attn from Russia; he's going to get us killed.
Yeah I'm sure you love the post, lairs just like you. You cant even back up our President and want to still use the sissy method on NK.
U voted 4 Dem bills 32% of time, to keep Obamacare, 100+ no votes. voted 4 nafta & many Obama bills.  U love the media camera. Showboater.
Not enuf? But when @POTUS backs it with tough talk, you balk! What gives John? Stop being phony, and just have @senchuckschumer over for tea
Well, you're a liar so no one cares what you think.
May be nuclear weapon in N.Corea from Russia. And China simply help to them
Your attitude towards trump is very questionable behavior when he is the leader of the GOP .i think you illness is affecting your decisions
McCain you need to shut your mouth if you are not going to back this president. He will bomb NK when it is time . He is not obama
Just go to sleep now, John.  You had your chances.
I've heard a lot of talk today, about this standoff. No one seems to be asking... What will China do if we attack North Korea?
Why not try supporting our President and actually standing up for the conservative values you were elected to inact?!
Bla bla bla bla!!!!!!!
Why do Republicans refuse to protect their own Quarterback? It's shameful! The voters deserve more. Do the right thing for our Country!
bomb bomb bomb NoKo... kinda has a good ring, right johnny ??
Instead of scaring everyone, what's the solution?
Mr. McCain. We didn't elect you to be the president.Please shut up or disappear.  We have had enough with your remarks
TRAITOROUS SCUMBAGS: McCain & Graham tried to gut 9/11 bill and immunize foreign governments funding terrorists https://www.jihadwatch.org/2016/12/mccain-and-graham-seek-to-gut-911-bill-to-immunize-foreign-governments-funding-terrorists …
Detailed Account Of John ‘SONGBIRD’ McCain’s Vietnam POW Cover-Up
SOROS FUNDED Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, John McCain, John Kasich, Lindsey Graham in 2016!
Oh, you wish.
He saw countries denuclearize and be overthrown. How will he EVER agree to it? Must take a different approach.
No, it isn't
You still here?
Sen. McCain, you know #45 can't handle this, it's time. #25amendment
How about nuking them? Is that enough? I say again: if anyone is hurt b/c of this "prez," that is blood on the hands of the @gop. PERIOD.
Invade them & take out the lunatic now.More casualties the longer we wait.Soon NKwill be launching from submarines:
Naturally your never happy with the  any Trump Team Victory. 15-0 vote?Your a War Monger
CHINA needs to stop playing games with the rest of the WORLD!
Damn I thought that since we did not hear from u yesterday that Chemo & radia  may have shut u up Oh well we will have 2 wait a few m months
Why should anyone trust you. You sold out your own country in Vietnam. Hanoi John Songbird!


So what's enough???
#McCain is tough on the bad guys...
Sanctions will fail until we understand that reunification, not nukes per se,  is DPRK's goal.  #longgame
seems simple, KILL THEM ALL and problem solved
China Japan and US could be pulled into a war by NK
WPO Fake News...Just like u McCain FAKE
Don't we have weapons to destroy any bomb launched? Would take an hour or more to get over to U.S. Isn't that time enough to blow up in air?
What's the traitor answer? 
Why would a setting Senator rely on a OPED from a newspaper. First President to actually take on NK as well as China And Russian leaders.
No acknowledgment from WaPo or McCain that Sec of State has offered to sit down with DPRK and negotiate. Should US just drop the bomb now?
John it's about time that you quit reading all the FAKE rags!! It is definitely affecting your judgement!!!
Down with you and the establishment. We will win in the end.
Ousting you from Senate would be enough
Oh sure thing Johnny boy
You read that rag paper. That's really sick
Somehow I knew you would say that. Can't bang your way out of every conflict, Senator. The VN war is over.
So critical but you don't do anything positive. Look at your actions on health care
But... War? We can't do that. And a whole lot of us are AFRAID of Trump-afraid he will cause a war ON PURPOSE to distract from Russia probe.
Enough would be full proof nuclear shields.
I HOPE YOUR TREATM  IS GOING WELL !I AM ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU! IN THIS GOD WILL HELP YOU ;A GREAT MAN DESERVE GOD'S GRACE; IN TIME OF NEED
Maybe if you weren't distracted by the savings n loan scandal u were involved in back in the 90's u could have helped Clinton with NK.
And of course you know more. Stop playing President.
#WeThePeople + #World have no choice! #war or extreme #sanctions They're going to make a mistake and blast someone. @FoxNews @foxandfriends
China is standing in the way of tougher sanctions on North Korea.  We need China onboard.  They supply N. Korea at a high percentage.
In the UN, still, we play a supporting role. You ask us all to support Trump.
It's a hard sell...
Your buddy Obama set this stage for Trump. Give him a big hug @SenJohnMcCain .
We should hit North Korea where it hurts - give them @SenJohnMcCain !
How about you vote the right way and help the American people and fix that stupid obama care
If course not You aren't happy till a war begins of course ????   You let us down last month with your no vote Tou should be ashamed
WaPo? No thanks. Please stop trying to start a war. You're no longer in Vietnam. Get some help. We don't want a war!
Please go there with Dennis rodman.
Such a disgrace   Michael Jordan didn't know when it was over either
And what is your answer McCain .... how about TERM LIMITS
It was too late to persuade North Korea. Only 'the action' exists against #NorthKorea.
Different john McCain if he was running for reelection what sad old fart
Shut up John .... you traitor!
Let's put John McCain on a icbm and let him screw up North Korea like he did the healthcare vote. Traitor.
Senator McCain . . . historically speaking, when have sanctions worked?
I wish you cared about healthcare for the middle class as much as Afghanistan and N Korea.
Holy sh!t @SenJohnMcCain all these must reads regarding Afghanistan & North Korea what about Russia I thought we were focusing on Russia
Pres Trump achieved the seemingly impossible with full security council. McCain is a war mongering @potus hater. USA won't advertise plans

McCain wants war with North Korea.. or Russia.. Iran.. he just wants a war!
What do you suggest we do?
Your no hero, your a bum..
Go away
What have u been doing to solve the problem w/ NOKO???   HUH???   Its ez to point fingers, right?
Time to retire...
Please focus on your health and recovery and let @realDonaldTrump , the man we elected as POTUS, run the country.
Sea Blockade and constant air monitoring. Any missile takes of, shoot it down in N.Korea territory!!!
@PostOpinions what do you propose John? A war?!?! You are Soros republican now. You are no longer a hero.
He's an Obstructionist!!
McCain truly wants war.  Where have u been Senator for the last 15 YEARS. THE PROBLEM IS ON U. Trump will address this issue
It's amazing that you are all over North Korea, but you couldn't keep your mouth shut in Vietnam.........
When was the last time @SenJohnMcCain ever solved a problem or accomplished anything?
Why should we do anything you suggest? I don't believe you have America's best interest in mind.
Says the warmonger rhino who sees all the $$ signs from American blood
We don't read the #fakenewsWashingtonpost why did you vote no on Americans HEALTH?, WHY?? WHY?? WHY?? we know u r a hater, Trump hater!!
So now you are taking tips from WAPO? OMG.
Kind of like VOTERS elected @GOP to get rid of Obamacare, but that didn't work-same thing! DUH! Establishment needs to go!World needs CHANGE

You should be focused on repealing Obamacare like you said when you ran for office not war liar
Retire
More than you were able to accomplish under Obama.
So, John McCain re-tweets a @washingtonpost article, WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU?
The American people have put a sanction on you Senator...RETIRE you RINO!!!
Your days are numbered why do you want your country day's to be numbered that's all you do is want to start War
Did you just wake up? You and your cronies let this happen and now it looks like you want war? Please retire before you do more damage to US
How much more can we do? We need China to put all her weight behind the scenes to help stop NPRK!
JOHN, THE FAKE WAR HERO, WANTS TO GO TO WAR.  SO THANKFUL HE WAS NOT ELECTED PRES.
We should drop you out of a plane over Korea so you can destroy that country just like you destroyed ours, cancerous leach #TuesdayThoughts
This would be more impressive if you hadn't been camped out in the senate for decades shouting for war w/a different part of the globe.
Thats right McCain wants War!
Thanks Mr John McCain  work hard every day  for country god bless you be safe
Same ol......where is Trumps criticism of Obama. He is doing exactly the same.
Ok John let's bomb the shit out of them start world war three and lose millions of lives.  Would that make you happy?
Quit being vague! What is it you want, a Sundae or banana split?
Сбитый лётчик, ты напрашиваешься на румяный хуй - Россия может раскрыть подробности твоей работы на Советы в плену
Traitor
Pay attention to the Sinclair Broadcasting Co, they are trying to buy huge chunk of local stations! They're a propaganda arm of Trump!
That's a good thing... WTF is wrong with you?... Everything Trump has done so far it's been good for the USA. @realDonaldTrump is for 
You are a expert on doing not enough, kim jon mccain. You pile!
I'd like you to pay a visit in North Korea, it'd be more enough.
Retire old man please
Quit trying to legitimize The Washington Post.
The Washington post is fake news and you're a traitor that killed 133 Sailors while showing off got away with it cause of who your dad was
strange we are willing to wage war with North Korea to stifle what Russia has done to our voting system and our unhinged President..
Thank you for one of the dumbest tweets of the day
I fear this unhinged POTUS has no knowledge of geopolitical dynamics to make that happen except to put our servicemen & women in harms way
He thinks Russia is in Europe
About 75% of the Russian population lives in the European continent.
Repeal Obamacare
Can't. tRump is teaching us to forego reading (well - anything more than 140 characters) and to just watch Fox News and his own propaganda.
Get on your horse  and ride over there! 
A little late to this McCain
Go away John McCain!!!
Your opinion or your word no longer count. You are irrelevant and no close to you will even tell you. You should resign. You're a liar.
Please retire! With dignity.
Sorry WaPo is fake news! Try again traitor!
The Washington Post and you are a lot alike neither one is worth a. Damn.
John let's nuke them.  Retire already
You need to retire and spend time with your family.
You and past officials created this mess. Had you not try to bribe them we would be in a better position. Bribe money has paid for this!
Please go home Senator!! Spend some quality time with your Family and retire from politics!  There was a good reason u were not POTUS
POTUS45  is tweeting about classified intel from a anonymous source. What is Congress doing? This man is a threat to our nation's safety
John always wants 1 more war.
Apparently he doesn't think 8 is enough.
