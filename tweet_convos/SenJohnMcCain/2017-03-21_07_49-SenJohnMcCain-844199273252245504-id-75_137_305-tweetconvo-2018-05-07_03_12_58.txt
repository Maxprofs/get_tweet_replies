In the old days he would have been suspended from his post while under investigation ! But now they allow a traitor to carry on and lead !
The US should not get involved in the civil wars of other countries but then you are a neocon war monger
Recall McCain, he is a fraud! he will get us killed by the Russians!

Sir, send tanks and boots. Every action against US interest and allies should be challenged.
you are a war hawk! the American people want peace with Russia! You have no business being in your position
We haven't finish our last war, & McCain is already trying to get us into another one!!
Not interested in ANYTHING coming from the UN!! We should be out of it and them gone from American soil!
McCain- let's take care of ISIS first OK. Europe can help Ukraine for now. It is NATO- right? RETIRE
America first.
Focus on our Vets our Starving Children
then we can help other countries.
stop supporting fascism!
McCain doesn't support Russia = #1 state sponsor of fascism.
Sir, I expect you'll be part of a bipartisan effort to find the truth about Russia. The system must work.
No, he's a patriot at least. What has Trump for our country? Draft dodger & liar.
Hate to break the news but you not President ...
Trump spending millions of taxpayer money on his weekly vacations is inexcusable.
WHY isn't #RexTillerson attending the #NATOMinConference, going to Moscow instead? #russiatrump #NATOAlliance
do it through nato
How much will Klimkin kick back to you and your NGO buddies?  #MAGA #TermLimits #DrainTheSwamp #MEGA #Russia
Yes, lethal assistance to Ukraine is long overdue. Senator McCain, plz make this happen.
Not going to happen under Manchurian Candidate Trump. We have been invaded! Impeach!
we need to show Russia that every nation has to be respected. Please do not let the Russians keep braking democracy. Dutytime
Senator who will give us protection from DISHONEST POTUS and  RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE??
Do you mean defend themselves from the White House?
Acknowledged, Sen. John McCain
Not you or @CarnegieEndow have any say in what is good for USA, @realDonaldTrump will decide that.
You are madmen. And full of BS.
I don't think we should get into, let them work it out themselves. We've meddled enough already,focus on USA
What about the agresssion in Arizona with drugs N crimes? Senator, lets take care of AZ
#Trumpcare is a gift  to the rich while our country needs the funds
But how? Your Prez is in bed w the Russians & Gop doesn't seem to care based on yesterday's hearing
Did u let Trump and Tillerson know? Putin may not let them do it.
change parties with @LindseyGrahamSC and @SenatorCollins . investigate and remove #russian puppets
Where was this concern when Obama was President? Silence
Trader you were 90 miles off course how many planes crashed,launched a missile on flight deck killed over 100
Please help our country! We're counting on you for a voice of reason!!!
yes mr McCain go in front of the cameras you love and say "I resign" then go retire
@CarnegieEndowWhat does Trump think? Why isn't Trump supporting NATO? Trump voters, is this what you wanted? You were conned!
Resign
Always looking for a war @SenJohnMcCain how many defense company stocks you own @CarnegieEndow
but Russia had the trump campaign take it out the RNC platform!
Putin doesn't need any special reason to escalate the situation. He kills our soldiers whatever you decide to do with lethal weapon supply
It is easy to tell other people to do something.
Why isn't Tillerson going to NATO? This is terrible!
But Putin is our friend now.
I think the country has grown tired of your shadow foreign policy.
We've grown tired of him!
Ukraine just released docs showing $750,000 funneled secretly to Manafort--Trump's campaign manager.
why are the US NOT PART OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE UN BUT READY TO ARM. FOR UKRAINE AND HUMAN Rights
Why din't your buddy Obama do it?????
Yeah, but @realDonaldTrump's buddies #PresidentBannon and Putin won't like that.
it seems Tillerson is more concerned with Russia than NATO
Yes!! Please do it.
