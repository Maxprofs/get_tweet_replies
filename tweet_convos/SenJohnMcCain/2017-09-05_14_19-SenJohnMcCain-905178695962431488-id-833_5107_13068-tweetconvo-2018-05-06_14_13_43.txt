Thank you.
We need one for Citizens United as well.
What is sooooo funny if if you look at all of your comments they are all liberals
John MCain please look into hackable voting machines.  Paper ballots needed for 2018.
I could not be happier to have @SenJohnMcCain as my senator. He continues to stand up to the partisanship that threatens our democracy
Disguisting.
Heading off the soon to be democratic majority.
Senator, we need 2 stop allowing either party 2 control election boards, rules etc. no matter who has majority, equal control&representation
thank you Sen McCain!
Thank you, Sen. McCain! #SCOTUS heard youTues. Oct. 3, 2017"Justices Split on Voting Maps Warped by Politics"

Thank you Senator!This is called being honorable! JohnMcCain will go down in history as being 1 of very few GOP willing to do theRightThing
Also please overturn Citizens United. We know alot of campaigns unlimited funds from Corps.It needs to be capped.Not campaign all year long.
Proud to see legislators standing up for representative democracy not dishonest @GOP electoral manipulation
Bless you @SenJohnMcCain
Sir I would vote for you if you ran for press and I'm a dem
Scotus has hearing on gerrymandering on October calendar
That's great now when do we get to.bomb Russia
Only after N Korea and Iran. There's a queue...
Russia first
Nor do we like voter suppression & legislators who serve funders rather than People. Sponsor a free market choice, http://www.thefairelectionsfund.com .
You two are my favorite <3
A TRUE American HERO. Thank you Senator McCain. Your voice is loud & clear and we need it! God bless.
Too bad you didn't do this during the past decade. Guess you were alright with it benefiting your party then. Day late, dollar short.
GOD BLESS YOU Sen McCain !!! Gerrymandering is the biggest political evil in America today !!!
What about the ACA? Why are you flipping? 
Thank you!!!
Senator, once again, as a constituent on the other side, I find myself saluting you and thanking you!  Thx for insisting on Am Values
What can Americans file to get rid of your traitorous representation
http://fjl2018.org/downloads/docket-117-cv-00793-lavergne-v-us-house-representatives/ … Good luck John
You are an outstanding Americans for a grateful nation!!!
Retire!!
This country desperately needs #ElectionReform Thank U Sen McCain #PaperBallotsNationwide #OpenPrimaries #OpenDebates #EqualMediaCoverage
Thank you Senators!!!! 
Thank you Senator for a non-partisan stand for principles of democracy and fair elections, serving citizens and country over party and self.
Ending gerrymandering should be something we can all agree on
Absolutely! That's why I volunteered to help collect signatures to non-partisan action in Ohio to end it for Congressional districting.
THANK YOU!
Thank you!
Gerrymandering is an assault on democracy & undermines the will of the people. It must end or the U.S. is finished as a democracy.
I live in VA-1 and my gerrymandered vote makes my democratic selection 100% impossible.  a tiny blue pocket in a sea of red.  JMC Thank you!
Sen John has seen the light and perhaps his own illness has made him act with a new sense of bravery and courage. This is an honorable man.
I don't see this SCOTUS doing anything about this.  Except make it worse.  The country's democratic processes are on life support.
Thank you Sirs.
Thanks from a NYC lib. 
It is nice to see you back instead of the unable to think for yourself lockstep GOP puppet you were during the Obama years. I like you again
Thank you Senators @SenWhitehouse and @SenJohnMcCain!
If we can address gerrymandering and voter suppression we'll have laid the groundwork to right the ship.
Thank you, Senators McCain and Whitehouse!
#SaveACA
But you'll vote to take healthcare from the elderly and disabled? Good to know.
Thank you!
John McCain is lucid again. He has his moments.
Once again, thank you for doing the right thing.
Of course, there goes Gunga Din Mc Cain carrying The Dems water for them, again.
Rare agreement
Thank you, Senator. We need this, as well as the return of the VRA & an end to voter suppression tactics, to ensure our democracy.
John McCain you stand for what matters!  Thank you!  #honor #Gerrymandering
TRAITOR
Gerrymandering must end, once and for all. It allows unqualified politicians to represent us. #NonPartisan #Legacy
Thank you Senator McCain. May God bless you.
Welcome to the Democratic Party Senator.  Next step...make it official.  You're going to love it!
#RESIST
Thank you Senator. Many of us Dems stand together & support the sacrifices u have made4 country. Plz GET WELL!
Tht's a good thng 2 do,don't trust Scotus'2 do a fair, legal or honorable job.May not have agreed w/Scalia, but trsted him.Not Gorsitch
Please tell your fellow GOP members to STOP trying to interfer w/ or derail investigation in2 trump & Russia.We need 2 know the full truth.
If GOP details this serious investigation, what little trust is left in the GOP 2 do the right & honorable things 4 r country will be GONE.
Thank you so much. I hope he reads it carefully and acts quickly.
It's a start but will it go anywhere???
You and Kasich.  A couple of progressive capitulators betraying the voters that put you in office.  Self serving hypocrites.
Good for you. But are you seriously co-sponsoring another bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act? If you are, shame on you.
Thank you Sir. 
thank you my brother
Always grandstanding and  presenting a false sense of fairness, but  will make  promises that were never intended to be fulfilled. Hypocrite
People before party. I salute you sir.
Good, now keep your hands off my sister's insurance stability.
Maverick's gonna Maverick
I love it. Voting is a fundamental right for all of us. Gerrymandering on either side should end.
I don't know who this "Gerry" fella is, but he has got to go!  Apparently he has been mandering all over the place.  Stop Gerry's mandering!
Lol!
Are you still on the side of ACA? Heard you were going back to repeal. Please say that's not true.
Do you disavow the campaign promises you made?
