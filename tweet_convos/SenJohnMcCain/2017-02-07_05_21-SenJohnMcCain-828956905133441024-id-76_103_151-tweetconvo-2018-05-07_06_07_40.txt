Assad is another Putin worshipper. We can't let this happen here.
@johnabooth @WSJ ref to Russia/Putin relationship with POTUS and election manipulation. Remove POTUS, senator.
Let's send the 9th Circuit over there. Sure they can handle the problem. 894/899
So when are you and the @GOP going to grow a spine and deal with @realDonaldTrump so this can be addressed?
Please don't flip on Devos. All what you're hearing is media and Democrat lies and rhetoric.
.@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ #russianhacking and #MinistryOfTruth indicate that this is all fake news. So please just move on.
