John should get his 99 coworkers to convene over nine days a month and pass some laws. Senate just a rest home
Don't let CHIP expire...those children need ur help. #savetheirlives&health
We all do!
Do something for PR. The gov should help instead of sleep during imp mtgs. Very disappointed in our gov. And a moron of a prez.
When the Gov asked for the Jones Act to be waived, Trump waived it following morning. Get your facts straight.
For 10 days 'baby'
Governor makes the request he wants, 'baby.'
Surely, the gov knelt and begged, please masser, give us ten days baby
AMEN!

Who the hell is PJ media? Is that like RT?
It's like PJ Media.
Isn't that why you supported Obamacare because it is cronyism? Be consistent Senator.
I admire you so much.  Thanks for standing up to Trump.
Tell that to the obstructionist corrupt Mayor of San Juan Carmen Yulín Cruz, and have her work for the people and get supplies out!
#RepealTheJonesAct
Why didn't we fix #PR years ago. Now we'll pay for the ingrates. Another $200B w/o accountability. Where are inhabitants? Look to #Miami and #NYC. Remember this avoiding of civic duty.
The McCain institute has some pretty big special interest groups listed as donors John.
You supported the Jones Act for years John- as did your buddy Hillary. Quit trying to spit on American workers
Hillary would be looking out for Americans, the ones living on island called Puerto Rico right now.
Sure-
Hillary left the Benghazi guys to be tortured and funded terrorists. She never cared about anyone
She should be in prison for life
Most of the Obama admins does
Exactly #LockThemUp
#LockTrumpUp

Especially since it was lifted for Texas and Florida...this is infuriating & inhumane. PS Thank You for ur years of service for the country
We are sending ships with cargo every day.
they are being held at bay.
A big problem is that the ports have been damaged. Ships that would chance docking would have to wave their right to sue for damages.
oh geez!! that's just awful 
It really is an awful situation.
are there other ways to help? 
Make some noise...call ur reps tell them to make noise in congress about lack of timely response for US citizens is inhumane
You're right. I=DEM.  U R one of few GOP senators I respect because of you're trying to be bipartisan. We desperately need that back.  T You
@SenJohnMcCain What are YOU'RE SPECIAL INTERESTS!? There was good reason to do what's been done. Do you even KNOW what you're talking about.
You would know!  Isn’t that what you are driven by?  Or is it just your interests? YouTube don’t give a rats ass about the American people!
Yeah John put those Panamanian ships to work, support your home country
Waiver Only for 10 days, @realDonaldTrump They will need materials to rebuild & it will cost 20% more! Repeal the #JonesAct NOW
NFL is a smokescreen for Trump not lifting Jones Act for Puerto Rico. Thanks for caring about the people of PR, Senator McCain...
Well said! PS.. I love your Meg on the view. Watching her right now. I already see growth and it's been three days. Be so very proud Daddy.
overthrow USA government? With help from Putin?  Shame on us all.   /end
Save the US people from the corrupt US government. And we'll need help from where ever we can get it. #DrainTheSwamp
US Corp greed at its finest. Time to smell the coffee and stop treating PR as the step child. Send in the US Military before FEMA.
Agree.  Time for Jones Act to go.  Otherwise, PR will never overcome debt.
Your never Trump snarkiness is really getting boring. Pretending your thoughts come from a place of honor fools no one anymore.
Of course they do but the great Cheeto just has so little insight regarding right and wrong that sometimes he just needs it explained!
Me-very liberal female-grateful4your leadership. You're brave @SenJohnMcCain #thankyou4 doing what you believe in.
Our whole country does, too. (#DrainTheSwamp for real)
What have you old-timers been doing in the Fed Gov for the past 30 years? Making it easier for Designers to build in Carib? NOT! #PuertoRico
. @SenJohnMcCain   Please do something to save PR. Form a committee, send bulldozers. Surely Congress can do that much without the pres.
It's only temporary to get people & supplies to Puerto Rico 
Thk you Senator! God bless.
Why haven't you done something about it.
You tell them!
Retire! You are no longer respected..Go with some of your career intact! Just Go
This isn't the time for political b.s. just get the stuff to the people in need it's not ok that people are suffering just do it
When did you find religion?
Thank You @SenJohnMcCain
@GOP have been trying to get rid of #JonesAct forever! So cruise industry (paying no US income  tax) can exploit crew!
This Jones act should be dropped all together or we will pay to rebuild and maintain #PuertoRico  it has left the Island bankrupt
Thank you, Senator McCain, for telling it like it is.
Yes, thank you. Can you do anything to change that?
Everyone deserves to be free of special interests. Culture of Special Interests ever present
you need to be institutionalized, and quick
"Policy decisions driven by special interests" is the way you Congress governs, unfortunately!
We know why he is doing as little as possible!!! Puerto Rican’s are illegals if he could take away our citizenship believe me he would!! POS
I see someone told you what the Jones Act was. Your staff is slacking.
Boy nothing but shit talking from mush brain
We have hundreds of ppl dying in hospitals in Puerto Rico due to delayed response. Senator, the delayed response killed people.
Was Jones Act passed by Congress?  People like you?
Maybe your great political skills can get it done you have been trying for years so much for Parliamentary processes! Drain the swamp
#PuertoRico   #JonesAct   
Yes, we know where Trump's loyalties are at >
Senator McCain, I have concern for the infastructure support and proper inspection. Invasive species could seriously hamper PRs Ag recovery.
Flatworms and insects can do such damage in a short time, especially if the area is already stressed.
Great leader great man all the wishes & the health you can get.
Seems like someone was more concerned about #AmericaFirst and #MAGA than actually trying to help the Puerto Rican Americans...
https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912487929783754755 …
You're a traitor to your constituents and the American people!
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
Thank you for speaking your heart, following your conscience, and doing the right thing. You are an exemplary Republican. Love trumps Hate
Nobody more driven by special interests than you!!!
What's your special interest John McCain. You have quite a few special interests in Washington. One of them forced you to vote no on the healthcare bill. Do you always get slapped around to force a vote?
How many of the 3 million PR American Citizens are registered voters who will remember this 3rd-rate-status treatment at the next election?
Thank you, Sen. McCain. Now, can you please get the HHS secutary to return our STOLEN tax $$$! What has become of the once honorable party?
You should keep this off twitter and in the senate where that type of talk belongs #statehood
You need to retire and shut your mouth
Why aren't there more senators like you? 
So does Guam which is hurt more by the shipping
We all deserve decisions not driven by special interest.
Special interest. Hmmm guess you would no nothing about that
President Trump wants to get rid of the "special interest" groups because it makes for more Swampers! I agree! Glad you do too!
He is taking the GOP down. this was about his 2015 PR Trump golf course bankruptcy . This was /is payback
Special interests = the Secy of Transportations family. They own a huge shipping co. Is also Mitch McConnell's wife. More payola.
Where are you going to put all of the ships with only one (day time only) port open?

Jones act is inconsequential
Special interest? Coming from you? Get ready yo meet your maker wet start.
Ask Mitch and Elaine all about it
Why doesn't @POTUS repeal the #JonesAct like he repels everything else? This country is ripping off the Puerto Rican people with no shame!
Senator thank you for speaking truth to the establishment
CNN: 9,500 containers stuck in port b/c truckers aren’t working and roads impassable. Trump waived JA-it doesn’t apply.
You speak from both sides of your mouth...GO TO BED!  @realDonaldTrump  is President ..deal with it..
Senator don't lump in whole shipping industry. I am sure that foreign flag carriers would support repeal of Jones Act
THIS IS WHAT IT EILL LOOK LIKE IN #PuetoRico WHEN THE GENERATORS SHUT OFF..
Well, it was lifted. Shut up McCain.
Top priority is protecting Puerto Rico an American territory with American citizens.
So does everyone else.  Try applying that logic elsewhere.
Hey John....thanks for fucking over Americans that depend on the ACA and who are experiencing huge premium increases.  But you don't care.
Merchant Marine part of the act needs a complete repeal immediately if Puerto Rico is to recover quickly #JonesAct #PuertoRico
@realDonaldTrump abandoning American workers again ... #JonesAct ... is only 3% of shipping... another greedy CEO...NOTHING NEW
Still killing it. 
Send the Navy Seabees to Puerto Rico! #VivaPuertoRico
Thank you Senator.
No matter what I do ee I eeeew I
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain
How many, if any, policy decisions are not driven by special interests?
So does America, Senator. When it comes to the laws that prop up and protect the health insurance industry...it's easy: #DontStopRepealin
Won't lift Jones Act because shippers will lose money? Maybe he won't send food or medicine because funeral parlors need the business!!!
McCain lies about everything....including his "cancer"!!
To who? Isis? Yep. A hero to them! Heros don't need presidential pardons. He's a murdering traitor!
Who are you talking about?
It's American jobs- WE KNOW you don't care about Americans John-and a disaster is a great reason to suspend -BUT IT'S THERE BC U DON'T CARE!
You complaining about special interests?  Your only interest is being an obstructionist. SAD
It's almost as if you could have done something about it.....but decided to be a party hack instead
Senator McCain, thanks for fighting for what is right. The law may have made sense in 1920 but in 2017 it's simply wrong.
Do something or shut up.
lead, McCain, lead...
Again you prove to be an American hero
Lead McCain, lead..
Traitor
USSOUTHCOM, XVIII ABC, & more launched to Haiti - what's up now? Was this type of disaster not anticipated by mil/other planners? Surprise?
This is the McCain I remember pre-2008.
Keep it up Senator. 
THANK YOU SIR!
You are a true Patriot

Unfortunately Trump is controlled by Special Interest.   I wished you were the President. .
So what other "State" or US Protectorate is blockaded from the outside world & completely dependent on the continental US?
And he's not? Did he forget about Navy CBs?
And we deserve relief from O'Care. Go figure.
Thank you for sticking with this until it happened!!
Let me see, who has the authority to change the law?
John when or if u run again will it be as a @TheDemocrats

Mr. Mccain please tell us the truth on how many sentors were out while the voting was taking place regarding the ACA (Obamacare) #openeyes
What took so long to help the people?  Our main concern should have been for the well being of the people.  What took so long!
Who made those shipping rules ?
Well done!!
That's great, but they need people to distribute from port, no contact wit drivers w/o power. Send in Nat'l Guard to drive.
Tell it 2 #Elaine
For 10 days only. In case you didn't knew. And I hope you're complimenting the senator, not me. #classy
The Jones Act is not a problem. This is a republican ploy to hurt American Workers & Industry who have benefited from it for a century.
For once you are saying something rational!
Use the wall money! I'm from Louisiana and poor Puerto Rico! Trump's Katrina!  It was a shame then and it's a shame now!
America deserves better than policy decisions driven by personal dislike of our President
Heard on @NPR that Puerto Rican's don't like the 1920 because it makes goods more expensive.  US gets paid as "middle man"
stand up for the people #hero #John McCain
Better check with Schumer it's a union thing.
Please continue to #HelpPuertoRicoNow
#SenJohnMcCain (D) you need to get off your but and fly to #PuertoRico so you can better understand what you write about!!

@FEMA_Brock @fema @uscg Please use helicopters to drop supplies in the areas you can't reach b4 more people die

…
John, how long have you been in office, now? You're trying to pretend like you cared before today??  Retire.  You're lies are catching up.
GOP motto "Money first, people maybe second?"

Amen to that Senator McCain
What some people refer to as a “special interest,” others call a vital strategic industry.
Mountains of food stuck in San Juan. 10000 containers. No trucks or roads. Why not use helicopters and drop supplies around Puerto Rico?
You're the voice of reason in DC Senator! Thank you!!
We wish his best friend @LindseyGrahamSC would follow his lead!
Once again yours is a voice of reason.  Unacceptable that it took POTUS so long to waive this law which puts people before policy.
The #jonesact was suspended 1 day prior Irma hit Florida-after supplies are already shipped to PR on US ships Trump suspends #jonesact
The US Anti Trust laws are a joke, supported by congressmen on the take from the companies who profit most. This precedes @realDonaldTrump.
Why stop with shipping? Why not offshore Congress as well? I'm sure a little foreign competition can drive down your wages as well. Instead we choose to gut our Fourth Arm of Defense in the name of $$$. #shameful
#protectJonesAct #protectAmericanJobs
Why would anyone including T care what the shipping industry had to say?
That's BS. This is about Trump and DHS. Who let it end on Sept. 22. Stupid. Don't blame the shipping industry.
You are from a land locked state. What the hell do you know about the benefits of the Jones act. It keeps me working, RINO
Senator, I'm from Texas, but I've always respected you.  I served when you did, but didn't sacrifice as much.  Why can't we send in a forward military detachment to Puerto Rico to set up comm., food and shelter?  These folks are in dire straits.  Thanks for listening.
Remember when you were a republican?  Yeah, me either. Traitor.
No to mention the Jones act costs 225K per job saved...that's expensive as hell
First Thank You for your service of this country, Pls Senator PR needs help fast, my family down there are going to Walgreens to eat if any
John McCain you de man. Run again and you might get my vote to bring sanity to corridors of govt
Way to go John. He has been against it for years. Ask the unions...
John MvCain a TRUE American Hero!
Many Thanks Sen. McCain "For Continuing" To Speak Out" (Positively ) on Major issues  Be Well"
Thread: “Special interests” include union merchant marine seamen like ME! We deliver goods and services to ports across the USA every day!
2/ The #JonesAct also prevents foreign navigators from becoming too familiar with our waterways-an often overlooked intention of the law.
3/ You wouldn’t want Iranian navigators becoming familiar with our coasts and rivers, or in charge of explosive cargo vessels on NY harbor..
We love you.
Thank you!!
Temporarily suspended until crisis is over , not difficult to do.  Give common sense a chance
Thanks @SenJohnMcCain
War Hero, my Senator.
The people don't listen to you anymore Senator.  It's time you cut ties and let someone else work for the people. You don't listen anymore.
GOOD FOR YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT
Thank you, not the time to be protectionist! Save Puerto Rico dump the trump STAT they are bleeding to death!
As a diabled Veteran who has disagreed with many of your votes I am appauled at the disrespect shown you under Trump's COUP ATTEMPT. TYFYS
TYFYS = THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.  I'm glad you had no Heel Spurs.
ah, puerto rico
the last colonial slave island...
Keep up the fight against cancer Senator. Thanks for all you have done! #trueamericanhero
Regardless since @realDonaldTrump took charge customs stop drugs etc entering.
Why did Obama allow lawlessness?
https://youtu.be/Elw-PQywZxU 
I'm so sad and ashamed.
@realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @SpeakerRyan: What r u & Congress going to do about it? ACTION, not words.
is the petrochem industry exempt/as i sit on the dock of the bay in corpus, i see all sorts of shotty, foreign ships go in/out of the port.
You are a true RINO.
Term limits now!
Thank you Sen McCain!!!!
Can't congress act here?!
God bless this great American Hero, good friend of Puerto Rico.
Go away, McCain.
Jones act.Tom Bosset lying over it.late responses.lack of true care.no air http://drop.red  tape.people dyingBS
An honorable man! Wishing you were our President Senator McCain. You make me willing to remain a Republican 15th hope we get our party back
