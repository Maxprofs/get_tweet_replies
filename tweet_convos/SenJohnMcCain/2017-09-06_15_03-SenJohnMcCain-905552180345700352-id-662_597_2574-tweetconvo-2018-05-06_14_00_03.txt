Stand strong John McCain!
And you have obombacare for your brain surgeries,right? Because I read where you said you were getting the very best care there is.
You support Democratic platform, which is only to resist Trump
& you fucked it up!
Since that is NOT happening with this "rushed through the Senate, non- partisan bill," we should expect a "No" vote!
# why should we the people be paying for your cancer treatments when you've done nothing for the American people???
U R the problem w/Congress. Go away -- U have screwed America for decades. Senators were never supposed to serve this long #tcot
Don't believe @SenJohnMcCain - He had his chance to Repeal ACA and gave it a Thumbs-Down. #RetireMcCain #TermLimits
Senator, you stated you have the best care available, yet you would deny coverage for millions of Americans? FIX ACA. No repeal.
Thank you for standing firm on regular order and bipartisan legislation for health care reform!
# why should the American people be paying for your cancer treatments you've done nothing for this nation !!
#you don't care about We the people!! If you did you would be working to fix this country  instead of blaming Trump ####
Regular order my,,,,,,,retire
# I think all senators and congressmen needs to be put on Obama care immediately !!! #and minimum wage !!
# and especially for you Mr. McCain, I would say senator but that would be showing you respect #you don't care !!
Just like the Dems did with OCare?   You blew it on that vote.  OCare sucks!  We can't afford premiums and deductibles- can you????
One more excuse for your lack of DOING SOMETHING! Now #Arizonans are paying 2+ times in premiums & 3+ times the deductible. Thanks Senator!
I can't even use this promise to wipe my butt, that is all this promise would be worth!  You and @JeffFlake are #Liars
Please vote no. Thank you
Please be America's hero once again. Thank you.
Hey McCain you pissed cause your weapons arsenal in Bulgaria was closed down?  Just think you cannot kill millions of Iraqis and Syrians.
Thank you Senator Mccain to your commitment to returning to regular order! The citizens of this country deserve a deliberative congress!!
If you refer to it correctly, ACA, that would be the first step to improving it.
.@SenJohnMcCain says legislate through regular order (and not more of that sneaky @SenateGOP treachery).
Really ? Just like Obama care was ??? Middle of the night.  Ur the swamp John.
I think you're becoming part of the problem not part of the solution
Absolutely Not it won't be a repeal it will be a bandaid to ruined healthcare (D) destroyed it they want Single Payer John PLEASE RETIRE
You are a liar and a traitor. We see you for who you really are. You should be ashamed.
like you members of congress.  You cannot tell me that this for profit health care system is just fine.  
Medicare for all.  That is it.
Please oppose this healthcare bill.  Legislation must be considered under regular order.
Sounds like more double-speak. How about supporting health care as a right, not a privilege? Commit to finding a way to make it happen.
#D T S TRAITOR!
You could have taken care of this. It's time to step down and take care of yourself! I blame you for healthcare not done
As you have done with former Republican presidents, do you have undermined President Trump every step of the way. What  do you represent?
It's only been 4 years. What is your deductible.
#getitdone or get voted out.  We don't care how it's done #MAGA
As you have said all along ??? Do you not remember your campaign ads ??
What are @SenJohnMcCain 's suggestions? Hope he opens up. I am sure his staff can put up a proposal.
Patting yourself on the back?  Please!  You had 8 years to come up with a plan. GOP is WEAK. That's why a non-politician is POTUS. #MAGA
.@SenateGOP Give up on your hateful vendetta against #ACA. You have much more important stuff to do: #DreamAct should be top priority.
Please Senator McCain for the love of God step down as a senator you have become worthless to our president and a traitor to our country
If you eliminate the mandates, the insurance companies leave the market - don't want to insure only sick, and premiums go up by 20%.
How do block grants help the working poor afford healthcare? You all are hellbent on having a group of rock kickers you can enjoyably kill.
Did DEMS put it in with regular order?   Do whatever it takes to repeal it.  DEMS DID.  WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP IN THE SENATE. YOU DIDN'T
You should just reitre and get out of the way.  Let @realDonaldTrump do his job without interference from unpatriotic people like you.
@516carmelo please hurry!!!  All this uncertainty everybody has bailed in #VA on ind hlthcare do to the UNCERTAINTY!!! 
Go away--just go away
What the HELL!!!!!!
Time for you to the same ACA ins. As ppl have.
thank U 4 UR rational thought. My SS & Medicare are all I have after my disability. Before anyone cuts either 1 of them. .  I pray 4 empathy
This moron, through hate, voted f #obamacare, putting the screws to millions of middle-class Americans. "Hero?" No! "Hell is for TRAITORS"
Single payer health care system.

3 weeks off.....not  enough to read the bill .LOL
Pleas help the Dreamers too!!
A bad bill is a bad bill, regular order or not. This bill is just as bad as the last. Forget Obama and think of the people it hurts
Go away john.  You are turning out to be pitiful.
@SenJohnMcCain left us with one expensive plan in Maricopa County AZ-Sad!  @dougducey @JeffFlake @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP
I find myself in the unique position of actually agreeing with John McCain for the first time ever
cc:  @LouiseMensch as always you were right #whitehat  cc:  @MelissaJPeltier
In other words, business as usual.  Nothing gets done.


1: Ok, time for some truth about "Graham-Cassidy"—the ACA repeal that MCCAIN just backed in a historic flip flop.
Dude, go away.
All along?  You voted straight repeal when you knew it didn't matter.  Coward
We need repeal, sir, and you blocked that. I hope @potus will do what he did with the debt ceiling and cut a deal with @TheDemocrats
So.  Thanks for nothing as you fold like a deck chair.
My guess it will take years like the 8 so far you have been dragging your feet for us Arizonans. Glad you have affordable healthcare.We dont
Then don't vote for it.  We used to think you were an honorable man. Now it is clear you are a partisan PUPPET. You are horrible.
The ACA or Obamacare needs to fixed not repealed.

Then do it quickly
So you and your DummyCrap partners can keep it! #MAGA #draintheswamp #mccainmustgo
Thank U @SenJohnMcCain SOS  @SenateGOP @SenateDems  stop to 'scapegoat-boycott' each other. Best to 'IMPROVE" what already has n SAVE TIME
That's not what you said 8 months ago.
Sen. a bill that a majority of Dems & Rep.agreed on before Trump was elected is now needed 2 have more conversation? 7,7 yrs. no excuse. Sad
Please retire. Every day you flip flop and I believe your brain cancer is adversely impacting your ability to rationalize. My sister had ...
glioblastoma and I fully understand the rational/irrational moments.  Your cancer is very aggressive and I don't think you can make ...
sensible decisions that impact millions of people any longer.  No shame, life is tough and tragic. I feel badly saying this to you, but ...
I implore you to take care of yourself and your family now and the US will try to recover from this draconian unAmerican administration.
what in this statement do you object to?   Working together is the way to bring America back together.  His statement is very much American
I object to his daily flip flopping. It is distressful to Americans, but also as someone w/experience w/Glio its indicative of big problems.
I object to him shaping policy bcuz I no longer trust that he has the appropriate mental faculties to do so. Being truthful, not derogatory
What he suggests in the statement is following procedure used forever.  Secret bills, pushing votes at 1 am is unamerican
MCSHAME you had eight years to plan  the end this abomination you are a fake phoney fraud
You flipped. Back to hell for you.
 ALERT: McCain has flipped on ACA repeal. All hands on deck. We need to pummel them for the next 24 days. 
http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/349462-mccain-backs-graham-cassidy-obamacare-repeal-effort …
You lied to your constituents to get reelected now they are stuck with high premiums and deductibles. TRADER McShame
Please work this and all important legislation out in a bi-partisan and transparent manner... Get well soon!
Sorry, sir. First explain the $9 million
I don't want it replaced, I want it improved!
A story you must read.:)

McCain & Flake too busy virtue signaling to meet with a constituent/mom of slain cop when she makes the trip to DC. http://trib.al/TpWlKaq 
This is fine,Senator! Just, please, after making , perhaps one of the most important legislative votes in our history, don't sell us out!
Turning on your buddy Graham now? Wow wow wow
You don't want it repealed or replaced, because you don't have to use Obamacare like the rest of AZ.

Lying hypocrite
So, this isn't something @JeffFlake can get behind? We all know you gave him cover with with the RWNJs in AZ with your NO vote.
Agree fully. Can the republican so called leadership align to this approach? I pray so.
That's all you do is talk. Less talk more action. All you do is obstruct and talk
@GOP @TheDemocrats STOP WASTINGG OUR MONEY AND TINE TRUING TO GET RID OF OUR HEALTHCARE JUST BECAUSE TRUMPS WANTS IT
It needs to be fixed, not repealed. But that doesn't make super pac funders happy, does it John. Those are the GOPs employers, your (1/2)
seat is just how you do their work, not ours. (2/2)
Hey Johnny boy, what do you have to say about this letter. You've can only dodge this for so long.
Never mind your campaign promise.
Hypocrite
Just get it done, and stop talking about it
GO BACK TO VIETNAM  SONGBIRD !!!!
You are nothing but a lying, unAmerican weasel. Just another example of telling your constituents one thing and doing something else.
Are you feeling better? Has the chemo kicked in? My wife will be on it forever. If you vote to kill EHB's, you stand with cancer John.
Please just don't vote for this. It is terrible.
McCain you've had 7 yrs to know everything there is to know about healthcare ideas. Remember you campaigned on repeal n replace. #RETIRELIAR
Your obstructionist buddies on the left didn't get this memo. The next time your out to dinner with Nancy and Chuck let them know.
