I'm still concerned with training in the USN and other branches. We need to stop losing good people to collisions and accidents.
I Hope We Can Get More Funding for NSA, HOMELAND SECURITY, CIA, FBI, and ALL OF OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES and PROGRAMS & HIRE BACK...
OUR HIGHLY TRAINED OFFICIALS THAT TRUMP FIRED FOR IN MY OPINION IS A DETRIMENT TO OUR COUNTRY! HIGHLY TRAINED OFFICIALS, OFFICERS& AGENTS...
ARE NOT LIKE TRUMP's DIME A DOZEN ATTORNEYS MAY BE. THESE HIGHLY TRAINED & EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEINGS THAT SERVE OUR COUNTRY ARE
MORE THAN I DO!  I THINK WHAT WE ARE FACING WITH THIS HEALTHCARE REPEAL VOTE IS COMMON SENSE, CARING OF HUMANITY & OF WHAT IS RIGHT FOR USA
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE and FOR THE FAMILIES AND FOR OUR COUNTRY! I DON'T THINK YOU, YOUR LOGIC & THIS MANY AMERICANS CAN BE WRONG ON THIS!
I agree with You on Our National Defense Funding. We have to do this to Stay Prepared to Defend Our Country. I don't like some of the things
We have to do but 99% of What We do I know We have to to Protect Our Country. I want our Military Members to have Life Saving Equipment.
Required to have to Pay for Defective Protective Gear that is an insult to Our Military Service Members and Our Country too. We have You in
What a boon to the economy if the masses could spend $3,000/year on consumer demand rather than pay the Obamacare Tax. Repeal please.
Authorizing #warprofits while taking away coverage for #veterans is NOT working for our nations military.
@SenJohnMcCain Graham-Cassidy bill will remove close to 2 million vets off of Medicaid. I don't think that was your intention. Couldn't be!
Imagine $8.5 billion spent on diplomacy instead of preparations for war.
Only one  1 uno  vote
We will need defenses with the way Trump is alienating us and having no ability to work diplomatically with anyone.

Good job SenJohnMcCain
Please vote against the Cassidy Graham healthcare bill, Senator. We are counting on you to help us keep our insurance. We beg you.

Vote no on NDAA and Graham Cassidy.
By re-electing you to a 6th term, our Senate works to counter everything the middle class & small business needs
AZ.  Why doesn't the GOP want you to have the type of good ins coverage John McCain had during his health crisis?
Under this bill, people with metastatic cancer will pay $142,650 more a year to get coverage.

That is not reform. That is a death sentence. https://twitter.com/CAP_Health/status/909838219809820672 â€¦
Please don't take my healthcare!!!!!!! It saved my life. Do I not deserve the same as you???
How about funding NASA more

White House officials fear their colleagues are wearing a wire for Mueller: report http://hill.cm/65tkWhb  
plenty of $$$ for bombs, but not for #bipartisan ACA fixes? #SaveACA
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC you all should be ashamed.
8.5 billion and you cant find it in your heart to give the America people healthcare. what is wrong with this picture? @LindseyGrahamSC
im sorry senator but all due respect, you're talking about funding missiles but you'all cant fund HEALTHCARE? IM SORRY BUT THIS IS DISEASE.
#VoteNo on #GrahamCassidy bill!
USA needs to work with many other countries dealing with asteroids, robotic space colonies, human space colonies
Congress took most Sky Marshalls off planes, refused harden cockpits.  Cargo security, fed building security very bad joke years after 9/11
High probability planes blown up by surface to air missiles takeoffs and landings in many cities.  John - do you think Congress cares?
2000 CDC Biological and Chemical Terrorism Strategic Plan.  John - do you think Congress cares?
Spanish Flu killed millions.  Stanford Influenza Pandemic 1918
VOTE NO ON GRAHAM CARE
I thought your first priority was transexuals & illegal aliens. You don't see this issue as high level. Perhaps your own ego.
I have a better idea. Let's get out of the war business.
8.5 billion to keep the folks who died because they couldn't afford medical treatment safe. John, you're a pip.
Retire
Both you & my daughter are being treated for cancer at Mayo. Which one of you has to worry about coverage for pre-existing conditions???
Please vote no on #CassidyGraham wealthcare bill. Charging more for or denying coverage for pre-existing conditions is a death sentence.
Vote no for Graham Cassidy proposal. Prove your words matter. Getting a win for GOP should never be the reason.
@SenJohnMcCain ***please stand up against the health bill again. DISASTER! We need your support. Fix the ACA. Problems are already known.




Retire already!
Traitor traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor
Please vote NO on #GrahamCassidy. Be remembered for caring about people more than party. #makemaverickinggreatagain
Please vote no- thank you
We need the defense bill but what about the Vets the VA hospitals and homeless Vets
Healthcare for all would be nice. NK isn't launching shit. They know they'll lose that fight. Let's stop the bullshit.
No thanks John...enough building the war machine...let's spend money on education not proliferation...
Missile defense is an illusion. No effective solutions are foreseeable.
Missile defense is a fraud. It would be nice if otherwise. This is just corporate welfare.
Yes, North Korea is a threat, but the #GOP is a clear & present danger to the American People. #KillTheBill #MedicareForAll
Remember the great healthcare you get for free and the healthcare you are taking away from millions.
We haven't heard your position on Graham Cassidy. You said we need to return to the regular order? What's changed?
Vote NO #GrahamCassidyBill  Work w/Dems to fix ACA
Shut up John. Go take a nap geezer.
Rolled back protections for ppl with preexisting conditions,PP defunded means millions will not have health care. VOTE NO! #noGrahamCassidy
Sir:do not let your legacy include support of this disastrous and cruel healthcare bill. You're smarter than that. You're Gov is wrong.
Az. Gov. said "yes" to Graham-Cassidy but it NOT the answer to throw millions off insurance. NEW name, SAME bill. VOTE NO!
Sen McCain you know deep down what needs to be done with that country
How about reinforcing health care for millions of Americans! Ramming through an UN-SCORED bill is not order - it's chaos.
ACA, while imperfect, is vastly superior to this bill. R's and D's need to come together and fix what is broken, and keep what is not.

My father fought in WW11 and Korean conflict he must be rolling in his grave knowing our great country is still dicking around with n Korea
I guess this means you are voting with GOP on bad healthcare bill. Nothing to say about it? Screw poor cancer patients.
How about if we reinforce prison sentences for traitors like you?
Wow thought you would be retired by now. Please do it sooner than later our country needs you out.

I agree with my friend @SenJohnMcCain: a sustainable solution to healthcare requires a bipartisan solution & regular order. 
How are you paying for this? Your party wants to cut taxes ie reduce income.
If you turn your back on the American people, your legacy will be tarnished forever. Don't let a bad bill determine how you are remembered.
You are a good man, search your heart. This hurts all Americans, including veterans. Why would you support such a thing?
Retire. You are another embarrassing elitist who has virtually done nothing in 3 decades
If you really cared, you would have fought harder against Obama's cuts. I'm not buying your patriotism now.
Fed. military spending is already 60% of my tax $. Please reduce by just 10% and we could end hunger, offer #healthcare, fix roads in #USA.
Where would you be right now, if you didn't have healthcare. Think about that for a minute. How in good conscience, can you let this fly?
Every ounce of respect I gained towards you after your skinny repeal vote will turn into hatred if you vote yes on #GrahamCasiddy
Graham Cassidy bill will take healthcare from millions and not cover pre existing conditions. You of all people should understand this
Respectfully asking you to PLEASE Save the ACA!
I can get behind this. But we need you now to get behind the overwhelming majority of folks who do not want to repeal the ACA.
This bill is NOT the answer. You know it. Your friendship with Graham should have ZERO bearing on your decision.This is about people's lives
John, let's talk.... the American people need you to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy bill. You know it's wrong and will be damaging to millions!!!
How will you defend the poor? Will you take away their HC? You're better than that Senator.
Nothing you say will make up for your stabbing the American people in the back with Obamacare & other betrayalsTRAITOR
RETIRE JOHN...
Mr. McCain, please vote No on #GrahamCassidy. #GOP had 7 years to write a good bill. 50% of all opioid treatment is paid for by Medicaid.
He can afford it,because we are paying for it
Please don't take ACA away. Many families depend on it.
Save our health insurance. Leave ACA intact. #GOPGreed Not you too, John?
Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
@GOP PASS THING THING & GOD HELP YOU ALL & WE WILL MAKE YOUR JOBS A LIVING HELL. YOU ARE THREATENING LIVES! STOP THIS NOW! VOTE NO! SHAME!
Missiles before healthcare, from a cancer sufferer, amazing. Protecting a country from missiles but removing it's citizens health cover ?
@GOP CONSIDER THIS: EVEN IF YOU ARE MONSTROUS ENOUGH TO PASS G-C, WE WILL SUE, OUR AGs WILL SUE, WE WILL MARCH, WE *WILL NOT* ACCEPT THIS!
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
Wow.. you're putting a lot of effort in to distracting from your support for #CassidyGraham aren't you. You're taking away my healthcare.
Why not just cull the heard of all the elderly, disabled and mentally ill? Seems more efficient. Perhaps a gas chamber? Nah. Too Nazi.
Stop the madness and leave #Obamacare alone. Americans paychecks and LIVES are at stake! God said do no harm to the poor and sickly.

Be a hero one more time. Save our healthcare. This bill has not gone through normal process. No hearings. Millions are counting on you.
PLEASE SENATOR MCCAIN DON'T TAKE OUR HEALTH INSURANCE AWAY.  WE ARE BEGGING YOU.
Are you still going to argue that we, as a nation, can't afford to let sick people have basic healthcare? #MedicareForAll
#GrahamCassidy & #RepealAndReplace = No.
#MedicareForAll = Winner, winner:  dinner.
#NorthKorea #FY18NDAA
 history notes your diversion.
THIS instead of saving healthcare for MILLIONS??? What are you thinking????
John, let's talk.... the American people need you to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy bill. You know it's wrong and will be damaging to millions!!!
Still with the distraction tactics?? #VoteNo on #GrahamCassidy!
Any good you want to do for the military will be tainted by a yes vote on #GrahamCasiddy
GOP Governors DO NOT SUPPORT the latest #Trumpcare bill. We don't either.  #ProtectOurCare
Would it not be more cost effective to bomb NoKo with bags of rice, cell phones and free Internet, perhaps even two ton money bombs.
@SenJohnMcCain aka songbird just shut it buddy no one cares what you have to say traitor
Seconded!
Seems like money better spent than a barrier with Mexico that already exists...
What will work to counter your assaults on POTUS. You have become one of your whacko birds. Just RETIRE and fade away.
"Voting for something that touches 1/6 of the economy and affects every American without knowing the cost is antithetical to conservatism."
