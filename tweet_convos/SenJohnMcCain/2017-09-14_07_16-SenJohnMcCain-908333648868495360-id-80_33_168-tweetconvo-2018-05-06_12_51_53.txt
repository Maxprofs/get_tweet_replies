Why waste the money when you stand for Socialism by refusing to repeal Obamacare.
I think there should be a 1% fuel surcharge and that money go directly to the DOD. They put their lives on the line in oil countries
Healthcare access is my #1 worry
In other words, the $600 billion+ that we already spend every year (3x the next-biggest military budget in the world) STILL isn't enough!
1/2 the budget to kill people, but "can't afford" universal health-care.
I call BS.
John McCain what have you done in the Senate since you've been in office accept drink from the swamp
Cha Ching $$$ more taking Americans money for military industrial complex elite & GOP RINO campaigns! Kevin Shipp exposing u slime.
Mr. McCain you and everybody in the Senate and Congress cut your pay and half take two week vacation and buy your own insurance

POTUS is seeing to it John, rest easy
So why did you let the funding get cut when Obama was in charge?  It's a little late to be speaking up.
And #Harvard makes a fellow of an American traitor. Pardoned by a traitor. Talk about that John.
False!!!!!
Where were you during the Obama years. You act like a democrat. Did those millions from Soros influence you more.
Who exactly financially benefits the most from these world-wide deployments?
Hmm.. your best friends hanio jane https://goo.gl/images/lc68Ve  and beneganzi hillary https://goo.gl/images/GTrxuF  you are nothing but a cull
Bwaaaahahaha! Omfg. BENGHAZI EMAIL OBAMA KENYA DEATH PANEL!  MUSLIM SHARIA DEEP STATE ANTIFA! 

Jesus Christ...
the defense department can not audit its books......they need to reprioritize the funds they have.  take care of operations first

Yay!
How about not putting them in the threat in the first place.
Your president will take care of it john
If any DACA member swears to the military oath, and serves to defend this Country, should automatically become a citizen. Can you fix that ?

POTUS is pro Military. Sure glad he is in office.
Let's curb the waste fraud and abuse in the military before we send them any more money.
Go home Johnnyee . You are a joke.
You don't speak for the Armed Forces, coward -
You mean govt contractors are well funded. Soldiers should get same raise as Congress. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @maddow @billmaher @FoxNews
Cyber - defend, retaliate. We're at war.
MCCAIN: A GLOBALIST: NOT AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST: GLOBALISM VS AMERICANISM.
MCCAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REBUILDING THE MILITARY! IT'S YOUR DUTY TO CARRY OUT THE WILL OF '16 ELECTORATE: TRUMP'S AMERICA 1ST AGENDA !
It is a shame we had to wait 8 years to get a well funded and equipped military.
Retire
$580,000,000,000 (yes NINE zeros) a year isn't "well-funded"?  Can we please stop the "REBUILD" rhetoric? It's over half our entire budget.
MCCAIN: SOLD OUT TO GLOBAL BUSINESS/POLITICAL ENTITIES : A GLOBALIST NOT AN AMERICAN NATIONALIST.
How about our children. We have DNA evidence and they still have no right to be in the country we served. We want our families. HR 1520
How about well paid also? They can barely survive & if they have a family forget it. They are important to our country.
Explain again how $84 million for viagra in 2016 helped perverted generals face complex issues in their marriages by raping cadets?
MCCAIN: REFUSES TO STAND UP FOR THE WILL OF AMERICAN VOTERS & SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMERICA 1ST AGENDA.

MCCAIN! QUIT USING THE ' MILITARY' AS PRETENSE FOR PATRIOTISM! A PATRIOTIC GOP SENATOR MUST SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC RULE & PUT AMERICA 1ST!
You & Obama took away from our military you traitor now you act like a big shot giving it back to them. You're a bad joke. Go home  forever
Can't work unless the military in mentally fit. W over half claiming PTSD at discharge WITHOUT a stessor we have a problem
MCCAIN! A TRUE PATRIOT & GOP SENATOR WOULD SUPPORT THE WILL OF '16 ELECTORATE & PUSH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMERICA 1ST AGENDA!
But Senator, your failed foreign policy is still running like a wild American Bison and doesn't know where to go from preditors .
Just look at what the Russians and the Iranians are doing in the ME and not mentioning NOKO and its H-Bomb ..
20 years of failed foreign policies are not so easy 2 rehabilitate and you know that Senator ..
try getting into the peace game, i hear it's very REwarding. why not make peace profitable so we all benefit from peace not war.
I don't trust McCain at all. I haven't been wrong yet. He is no man, HE IS EVIL IN MY OPINION. He will be made to answer 4 his actions.
Where was he when Obama was stripp'g our military?Sitting back laughing right along w O & C?GREED IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL, lavish lifestyles
Please explain how Obama "stripped our military". The budget is over 500 BILLION A YEAR.  Stop getting your news from Facebook Shirley.
Well this comes from a man who graduated 4th from the bottom at the academy
Let's cut the defense budget by about a third and use the savings on helping Americans.
Americans, NOT Illegals! #BuildTheWall  #EndDACA
"Threats around the world"?  No, regime change around the world
This was your all day message yesterday Brutus. Health care, taxes, immigration, hurricane relief. Flapping trap, no results. RETIRE
MCCAIN! SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMERICA 1ST AGENDA NOT YOUR GLOBAL SUPERPAC DONORS & CHAMBER OF COMMERCE!
BUT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING SO MUCH WINNING!
One of the saddest days in America was when you become a Bottom Feeder!
Soon we can downsize as robots take over combat duties
No it's about turning America into a COMPLETE police state for your one world government corporate masters...just like the NAZI dream
What about those of us that are LEOs that can't afford our healthcare that you turned your back on?
I would love to see respect and real medical for all who serve and their families.  I am not sure what Sen McCain has to do with it.
