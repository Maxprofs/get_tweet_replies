Could you tell @realDonaldTrump to pay the $33 Million in taxes he owes them from "Defaulting" on his property !

What is Wrong with you
Wrong with me ?
Not you.  The person giving double fingers to @SenJohnMcCain
It's a bot account....block it !
May God bless you Senator We are praying for you & won’t give up until your full recovery.
This is #VeryFakeNews. He was a traitor & pardoned by Nixon. Responsible for the deaths of sailors as well as injurying another 100
Here we have donald trump a 5x draft dodger & we have John McCain.Thanks, but no thanks. I, a military mother pick McCain with utmost pride.
He's a traitor to the USA and should have been in prison for treason. Sold out his comrades to the enemy. I grew up military .Trump respects
What does that have to do with showing support to Puerto Rico at their time of need? Think they are worried about that right now? 
My reply that you saw, was to someone who brought out an irrelevant subject about Sen. McCain’s service. I was responding to his tweet.
Yea I noticed that. It wasnt directed at you 
Thanks for clearing that & you are so right, it should be about our own folks in Puerto Rico right now, not irrelevant political revenge.
To resume your anti-human activities?

Exactly! Sen John McCain makes me proud to be an American. God bless him and his family. 
This is #VeryFakeNews. He was a traitor & pardoned by Nixon. Responsible for the deaths of sailors as well as injurying another 100
supplies are there on the port, The purto ricans have to work distribute goods to the people. Floridians&Texans worked hard on their own
We the people have urged you to support the @POTUS agenda but you have failed the people. We don't take you seriously on any issue.
Can u tell Trump to get off his golf course n help save puertoRicans
chuck don't care American families and democratic care about them self only
Thank you Senator McCain for continuing to be an American #hero
Thank you, Senator.
McCain go back under your rock in AZ YOU are such a waste of taxpayers $$ Term limits poster child JOHN MCCAIN
Amen brother 
You are always a hero and put the country first! You're in my prayers
You did hear the president say ships were on the way right why don't you have regular airlines fly and supplies to if you're so concerned
Thank you very much. God bless you in your journey!
10 day waiver is ridiculous. Need at least a year to help rebuild #puertorico
Can you just move into the White House for a bit?  Send the fraudster on a permanent golfing vacation (please). 
He lost to Obama- remember???
Thank you Senator McCain for efforts to waive The #JonesAct for #PuertoRico. So sad that it took a Hurricane for Congress to focus on PR.
Please make this happen!
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your help & voice in Puerto Rico #MayorCarmenCruz
You McCain are a big BUFFON YOU HAVE NO POWER TO DO THAT. Remember u will be meeting God soon stop lying
Another thing that should have been done right away. Thanks John.
Politicians in PR & the US need to get together in order for the Jones Act to be Waived.
What would we do without your wonderful leadership!!THANK YOU!
My mother who is 68 and disabled and needs me to shop was throw and escorted out of #Target like s convict all for asking aquestion #justice
Every time I read one of your tweets, it reminds me how proud I am to have a brave and compassionate senator representing us. Thank you!
And Trump admin. said no. That's because you urged it. Immature Donnie is getting revenge any way he can.
Could you tell @realDonaldTrump to pay the $33 Million in taxes he owes them from "Defaulting" on his property there !
why aren't the other GOP senators like McCain?

I thank you for the heroic service AGAIN.
So Why can't you do that for American people in healthcare I don't get it. What would you do without your healthcare
He is doing his best for health care.
Not buying that.
@SenJohnMcCain thank you for taking the steps needed @DHSgov to waive the #JonesAct so that the people of #Puerto Rico could get help!
Great job At least there's someone who cares more about PR than about the NFL Keep fighting for us Senator
Go away traitor.
Thanks, once again, for being the adult in the room. #Hero
Too bad they waived it for such a short time.  But thanks.
#TooLittleTooLate, as usual  
I agree. The Jones Act is an outdated law anyway. Get rid of it and go help Puerto Rico.
Stop using my #PuertoRican ppl for your personal political agenda! Repeal #Obamacare or get out of the way!
You "urged"? You love the spotlight!
Only temporarily, we need this repealed permanently if the island will ever get a chance to get back on to its feet again. #PuertoRico
#JonesAct waved for only 10 days while #PuertoRico remains in humanitarian crisis for months!
This is real leadership
Love you, John, you are a stand up guy.
Love you.  You stand up against the hypocrites.
This is a part of the U.S. the lack of funding to help our citizens is nauseating from out leaders! #HelpPRNOW
I have to ask myself what's in it for John McCain?
Did he happen to explain why it took him a week?
Hang in there John, fight & win against this, your most difficult battle yet....
Now congress needs to repeal the Jones Act for good. Maybe PR wouldn't be so far in debt if the Jones Act didn't exist.
Thank you Sen McCain that is good news!!!
Thank you, Senator McCain. 
Aid is at the docks in Puerto Rico and not being distributed. FEMA - is not moving fast enough! How prepared are we as a country? #mariapr
He is killing with us with his greed! The world is watching!!! He is not fit to lead as a country. Americans are in danger!
McCain is pandering to the Heritage Foundation. This is the real story-
According to live reports this morning, it won't do a thing to hurry delivering supplies and food stuff.  The logjam is at the port of S J.
Thank you!!! Please keep pressuring federal government!
Makes no sense that usvi has a permanent exemption.
Go back to bed McCain. You are a lying coward against the true Americans who put you in office.  You just spout off.

What is the problem w GOP letting this maniac kill our country? Come on!
~Thank You American Hero Maverick Sen. John McCain!  You are The Best!
Waived??? Repeal the Jones Act for Puerto Rico  that's one thing that was killing the island to begin with!!!
Thank you for Sir! #JonesAct hurts Americans; seems like it needs an overhaul or sent to the scarp heap
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/repeal-outdated-jones-act-allow-puerto-rico-usvi-heal-more-quickly-and-efficiently …
I'm sorry, Senator. No KUDOS from me to you or anybody else for doing this NOW, when it should have been done in anticipation of IRMA.
Discrimination against Latino US citizens is the only explanation. Shame on Trump. People that didn't have to die, will, and he's to blame!
God Bless You @SenJohnMcCain we pray for your recovery and humbly thank you for being @PuertoRicoPUR people's champion on this fight
Thank you for your leadership.  This is your legacy.
You're still alive?~
Thanks Mr. McCain!!!
And again, John McCain is the clearest most rational voice in the GOP. (Non partisan) support for Americans is what Puerto Rico needs. NOW.
Thank you! God bless you!
Thank you! Please organize a PR congressional delegation asap. We need Congressional leadership for PR Relief @JetBlue into SJU or BQN.
Since @realDonaldTrump won't allow you to use military . Please go anyway if you are well enough. If not send other Senators.
Please retire
Thank you.
Thank You
I love you, John McCain.
Repeal the Jones Act Senator.
McConnell's father in law is supposed to be a shipping magnate. Things that make you go hmm
maybe if all 3.5 million citizens in PR would take the knee at the same time, maybe Washington would help them, we will not forget
Thank you Sir!!!
Thank you
... says the more liberal leaning person since "someone" has been in office...
As always, you are the strong leader we need to balance all of our needs for the United States.
Thank you Senator, you are a voice of reason, a treasure.
Is any other @GOP going to speak out about this? Its always party over humanity with the rest of the republicans
Thank you!!!
Thank you, Senator! Thank you! #TheRightMove @tperran
Thank you . Please keep pushing for waiver
Because you are a good honest man. Was honored to meet you.

Thank you for your service to this country! I'm a democrat who wishes we could have you in the White House! #Respect
You are a true hero!!
This is the #maverick I remember in 2000!!!
thank you Sir for trying to help our fellow Americans!
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for true #leadership AGAIN. Waiting for @realDonaldTrump to step up and do the right thing.

What can we do locally to help #PuertoRico?
Thank you, Sir. This is something that could have been taken care of prior to the hurricane hitting Puerto Rico.Trump can wave the Jones Act
Yes we do,    good luck with your health my hero
Should be completely removed. Don't do things half assed.
Given this POTUS makes use of Exec Order, this shouldn't be an issue, then again, these are POC who probably wouldn't have voted for DJT.
Thank you, Sir. Wish there were many more like you. But one will have to do for now.
Ok.  I am finally starting to like you.  Will be awhile before I forgive Sarah Palin tho
Thank you Mr McCain for caring.
Appreciated. They are Americans. They are without water, power or medicine. What have we become?
Mega bright idea Senator - lets push it forward 
You are a good senator!
Please keep fighting to #HelpPUERTORICOnow I got word that my uncle died today wait for help. Waive #JonesAct Americans lives depend on it!
Trump only cares about @POTUS and GOP only cares about the rich people who bought their loyalty. SAD!
#helppuertoriconow #WaiveTheJonesAct #helppuertoriconow #WaiveTheJonesAct #helppuertoriconow #WaiveTheJonesAct
Thank God for John McCain
Thank you!
Support impeachment for dereliction of duty .... do better...
Yes and today Agent Orange said "no" because many shipping companies don't want it. Waiting for the Death By Trump numbers to come in
Thank you.
Thank you!! It's been too long...people are suffering...
declare Marshall Law in Puerto Rico NOW!!!
My hero for another day
You shouldn't have to ask! They should have responded & been prepared to respond to the projected needs by now. Life in tRumps 'merica
Muchas Gracias!
The Trump administration is claiming that the problem is damage to the ports. But then was the the industry is against it -- wonder why? $$$
Thank you Senator. Trump doesn’t seem to care.
Thank you, I love you, I always said it on my Facebook page
I don't think DHS is listening & @realDonaldTrump says the shipping magnates don't want waiver to happen. #TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Good, because CUBA said they will send in their doctors and help..they have incredible doctors highly skilled! Please waive the #JonesAct
Again a hero in the Senate
thank-you Mr. McCain, I'm not American and still donated to Harvey relief. God bless you and your family!!
typical evil McCain lying to get his agenda accross.
Keep pressure on this issue. People will die without this help.
#StopTheHammering #endMSM #fakenews
Oh, here’s another reason Trump won’t allow his. His grudge against McCain. @realDonaldTrump is unfit for the office he holds.
Seems like this is Congress' responsibility
Yeah but u got no moral authority on account you still get vote wrong on Obamacare you scarecrow!
Great, sir!
Prayers.
DJT will keep everyone in suspense, announce it just before or during PR trip. Never let a good crises go to waste. Then he will want cheers
Why not amend the #JonesAct so automatically waived in these instances? Not familiar w/ act to know if it's EVER necessary or more BS any1?
Thank you, sir. You are truly the only decent GOP Senator left.
TY Senator McCain. I don't agree with yur political opinions, but I appreciate u & the extremely hard 2 match service u have provided 2 U.S.
So, Senator, since Team Trump won't do it, Congress should repeal it and override the veto.
and of course you got no attention thanks to your white trash supporters who're deserting you bc of your late earned integrity , God bless u
I'm a hard core Democrat, but if I was Republican you would be my idle.
Thank you for your humanity here and w healthcare.
My man
The fact that they even have to think about this is pitiful
Thank you!!  You are a TRUE HERO!!
Thank you for showing us what true leadership looks like. If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything
Thank you, #SenatorMcCain for demonstrating once again, your love for this country that's great!
@SenatorMenendez @SenBooker we want support for a waive on #JonesAct
Trump allowed it quickly for TX and LA in recent hurricanes - what's his problem with Puerto Rico?
Dont count on it, brown people r not on trumps list to be saved.
Thank you, Senator
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you so much! God Bless You and your family Sir! <3
Agreed. Why is it taking so long? US citizens are suffering.
Even though I supported Hillary I would have been happy to have you as President. The Sundowner Kid is not capable of governing. Amend 25.
Maybe you also should protect Mueller?
Very good idea
Better idea
A littlle humor I hope

There are three thousand containers that cannot be moved we need more military in there to move this Aid we need airplanes and helicopters
Thank you Senator McCain. Now the people responsible for this response need to be brought before Congress and held accountable
Get well soon my hero
This would help us greatly, if the military takes charge of distribution of goods here in PR that would help us too
Good to see integrity that's missing from Trump and others in Congress!
Yes please! If the concern is natsec through immigration have PR use US passport to cross into the mainland. Just like Hong Kong to China
I never thought I'd be this thankful, this often, for John McCain.
Thank you, Senator McCain! You are a true American hero.
Keep fighting the good fight, Senator.
Right on a John
Thank you from our hearts to yours.
agree! Sir thanks for your kindness. We are devastated but fellow Americans like you make us stronger.
Thank you Sir for your support to #Puerto Rico
Thank you Sir. #SavePuertoRico
Gracias!
Thank you Senator for being a true leader and Hero this Nation needs, for all Americans not just the ones on the mainland.
Shut up TRAITOR & THIEF
Thank you for your service, Senator McCain.
And Trump said no. Said the poor shipping industry doesn't want it. Wonder how much they paid him....
This will do little to help while their ports are in this state of disrepair. McCain is just pushing this because of one of his failed bills
Now with all the backlash Trump says he is considering it. A little late for Puerto Rico.
