CLINCHED. 

#OurSeason just got wild! 
Totally boycotting anything related to @SenJohnMcCain
Except his Twitter account, apparently.

Why do you hate veterans, and thus freedom, and thus America?
It's sarcasm, dickhead.
Repeal or resign

A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
Do your job or resign! Watching baseball while healthcare is failing? Thank God you were never elected President! Never will now! Karma
It's Sunday. Are you at work? Do you get time off? Hopefully he votes no for the ones counting on him, but the man has a life
I work when shit needs to be done no matter what day it is
Lucky you! @JDMartinez14 put you over the top.  Best of luck @Dbacks

@SenJohnMcCain rooting Dbacks all the way ! I love  your state and baseball  and my  over your diagnosis #Fight #StayPositive
Well done D-Backs! If you win, please DO NOT visit the Whitehouse.  The sane must all stand together! Go get em D Backs!
Thank you Senator you stand for America.
Your courage and ethics complement your vision for America
Return to US to constituents end tribal
McCain is no republican and he has no ethics.
I do not know about AZ, but McCain stands for the United States. His actions as a naval aviator, POW, and public figure. Stands my review
He has not been a naval aviator for a long time, since then he has done nothing for Americans only himself.
Reconciliation is what McCain is standing against, it prostitutes the Constitution
McCain votes on healthcare not Republican tribal aligence
McCain is a Democrat, he is no Republican, never was.
Great observation John, McCain is voting for constituents in AS and in the United States, his vote shows understanding of Constitution...
Be a hero again and not a man who holds a grudge. Fix healthcare and don't cowardly sit in the shadows
Who told you heros don't hold grudges? McCain stands by what he believes.  And like the rest of us, he knows trump is a thug
McCain is the thug.
Are you jealous? McCain is not a thug, silly. He's a Veteran, a Hero and an intelligent person..which explains alothehe
Read a little, Dana.
Drop off, Ed.
Public domain, Dana. Feel free to block me.
Thank for your service. I'm not with the GOP. But I respect you and you loyality to the Democratic process of negotiations with both sides.
It would be great if he actually did something.
Only 3% are abortion related.most services include mammograms,std testing and other women reproductive care.
3% not funded through federal funds. Hyde amendment.
Show me data where planned parenthood buys baby parts.the people who made and edited that video were the ones charged with a crime.
*video not following
But. But. But. We need to respect our vets and flag. I assume u against kneeling to anthem but shit on a war hero. The irony
Source?
We miss @JDMartinez14 here in Detroit.  Good luck in the playoffs.
The Diamondbacks hate you... just like the rest of the Americans you lied to.
Congrats @gregorblanco7 !!!!!
Thank you for the service that you did for our country! Much appreciated!
Trust Jesus with your whole heart even when you see nothing happening! Praying for you!
Hi Mr. John McCain, just want to say that Cancer is not what defines you. Jesus has you in the palms of his hands. He is not done with you!
That is great!  How about an affordable HC Plan for Arizona.  John, I'm waiting to review your HC Plan, since u don't like those available.
RESIGN NOW FRAUD!!!
Congrats @Cancer!  #OurCountry

You finally admitted you're a liar and never intended to repeal Obamacare. LIAR! I bet you're lying about having cancer too.
Remember what's important this week: nation’s doctors, hospitals, and health plans urge rejection #GrahamCassidyBill
Sure they are doing what is best for Arizona.  Now it is your turn.  Vote for the Graham bill!
You've been an obstructionist you're entire life. Shame on you. https://youtu.be/dzVxbUOn4EI

Congrats to your team
Dear Sen. McCain, Please don't forget: the promise was repeal & replace with something better.  Where's the better?
Why did you hide the fact that POW'S we're left behind?
And congrats for the great healthcare you can get. Only people in Arizona that have good healthcare are the Diamondbacks & the snake McCain!

you know what happened right after Arlen Specter screwed Americans by voting for Obamacare, right??? Karma is a bitch, John
Maybe John McCain can be a sports announcer when he retires. I'm sure he supports the NFL taking a knee. Stick to healthcare in meantime.
You're a phony liar.
@realDonaldTrump is right,you're no war hero,its more like you're a sellout bum,you'll go down in history as a top 'Rino', not a good legacy
Pathetic and disgusted. Want to go out as a celebrity ...no good media grabbing liar and traitor!
Your legacy is written ....TRAITOR AND LIAR! You are the swamp!
You are nothing but a media attention... no good traitor and liar. You are the swamp and won’t be missed
John how about you quit trying to kiss everyone’s ass and do your job you traitor!!
As we expected, your "no" vote was personal. Time for a recall election. #MAGA #RecallMcCain
John. You are embarrassing yourself and the people of Arizona. It's time to step down with dignity.
you are a back stabbing rhino! Retire and go away already. Let the big boys take care of things!
John McCain please raise the issue of genocide Buhari government is committing in biafra LAND IGBO now. It is ethnic cleansing. Please help
Where is your true heart? For the people who believed in you when you promised to repeal & replace Obamacare vs your self love?
Who cares
Care about why your in Office. Not baseball. They all get free healthcare as yourself. DO YOUR JOB.
John McCain is the best reason for term limits. This old out of date, bitter, Trump hater is the best reason to vote for term limits.
Gooooo Dbacks!  Also senator, please do not cave under pressure. I will hold you up. I believe in you. Please help us all. My patients and I
So now you admit you're screwing Arizonians as well as all Americans by not voting to repeal Obamacare because of  your hatred for Trump.
GO DBacks!
While you celebrate D'backs, you gamble with peoples lives by entertaining bribes from your bff Lindsey Graham? Do NOT change your NO vote!
John, retire please. Just because Trump said bad thing about you, you take your personal revenge against the us public. shame on you!
The entire Trump election is a cyber war started by Russia,based on white suprematism and neo-nazis in America. In case you didn’t know.
Please read this @SenJohnMcCain. I know you are going through so much already but we need your patriotism once again
(THREAD) This is a thread about Donald Trump. If what it says conforms with how you feel, I hope you'll consider sharing it with others. 
What has happen is death of NFL,,NBA,, and baseball. Causing prejudice on brand new level. Worst kind
Never Once Were You Actually Serious About Getting Rid Of Obamacare #FUJohnMcCain
YOU ARE 1000 TIMES BETTER THAN TRUMPLER，
YOU ARE A GREAT MAN， THANKS。。。
YES I VOTED FOR YOU THEN。。。I WAS RIGHT。。。

Actual audio footage of John McCain - making radio broadcasts for the N Vietnamese. He had to get a PARDON from Pres Nixon when he returned! https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/912156053999112192 …
You go mccain
Boycott McCain, he is a RINO.
Do something for your state, healthcare costs are through the roof, no thanks to you.
Shut up McCain...We have all had a belly full of you.
Hi Senator! Glad you’re feeling well.
yet you have rebuked him & US. Why?
afflicted cares not for US but for them who do not. Sir, God has given you a chance & the power to do something great ...
#johnmccain still butt hurt over Trump remarks so bitter little man mccain says FYou to middle class!!Add BitterJohn to titles
One that could cost me all I have worked for & the lubs you allied with are my enemies..by proxy of their own creation..yet you a man ..
My only crime is that I obeyed the laws & now II am working hard to return to work but a new inident has me concerned. ...
I worked & paid taxes & am an American citizen. I joined the service but encountered health issues & was discharged..worked for years after.
And you unite with them.
which is useless to me & may not save my life? Why is my life less significant than yours? The libs you unite with have determined my fate.
You haven't kept your campaign promise to repeal Obama Care. Impeach McCAin.
America DEMANDS paper ballets and at least 2 registered party monitors. NO MORE MACHINES THAT REQUIRE SOFTWARE AND INTERNET HOOK UP #GRAYHAT
So please convince me that for me & others that you who receives outstanding medical benefits insist that I must pay for that...
if I as you am diagnosed with cancer...I will die because I can't afford the treatment. If I lived in Ma. I would be eligible for Medicaid..
Please Senator do not let the GOP bribe your vote w $$$$. They are trying to pay your state more money to kill the rest of us
You leave the American people to suffer with a broken healthcare system
On the contrary, he is urging the senate to fix Ocare through regular order in a bipartisan fashion.
Senator McCain, with all due respect, I've supported you through two presidential campaigns, but now when we need you the most to step up
My income is low but I am not eligible. I am tonight suffering a new issue that.concerns me. If it is significant ...let me be clear..
I am a physically disabled women with pre-existing conds. RI is a blue state & accepted.Medicaid grants under O'Care. ...
You need to understand that the libs are not one of US. They care not about Americans. ...
Thank you for standing with Arizonans against Graham-Cassidy! Go Dbacks! See you at the ballpark, Senator!
Don’t be bought off with this revised bill. You are better than that.
How does Jared still have a security clearance?
He lied on job application 
He now may have worked for POTUS on private server
Lock him up

Liar!!!
Lucifer is waiting for you
@LindseyGrahamSC must think highly of you, @lisamurkowski and @SenatorCollins if he thinks he can bribe you. Sounds like a great friend.
Try worrying about Az health care problems! You do everything but your job! Songbird is a tough thing to live down #WASTRUMPRIGHTYESHEWAS
Glad you are enjoying the game, while you screw Arizona voters. RETIRE Brutus
Take a knee johnny
Jared:
Met with Russians 
Gathered opposition research on canidate
Lied about contact  to America
Lied on job application 
Sold BM 5 Visias
Nice piece on 60 minutes! Best wishes and a speedy recovery!
One Vote Johnie step down so you can watch your f d backs.  Step down traitor
Turncoat Traitor!!
Thank you for your service.  Keep fighting for the people.  #OurSeason

McCain is a liar. Eveytime he's up for re-election  he says he's a conservative. Last election he ran on repeal & replace. All lies! Loser!
Good team John & also like seeing your Arizona Cardinals play as well!! I believe they play Dallas tomorrow!!
STFU traitor. Already back stabbed your constituents. Zero credibility. Thank goodness your time soon will b up in Senate #GrahamCassidyBill
Thank you for your service sir.
this is what makes you happy John McCain I'm right there by your side go Diamondbacks
Thank you for voting no on Cassidy healthcare bill and Go DBACKS! Hope you can make it to the wildcard home game!
Retire John, it is time!!
wild card is it!
About the only thing @SenJohnMcCain an I can agree on.  He's still a self centered angry old man who is beyond his expiration date.
Hope they don't pull a "McCain" - you know - get your hopes up with promise - then stab you in the back - exposing themselves as losers.
Now if you could come through with a NO vote against repealing the ACA we'd really hear something wild.
Thanking you in advance sir.
You punked we the people of Arizona AGAIN, as well as our governor, just because your hatred for our President!
Good thing thanks to you they will still have Obamacare!
I hope you all know that he's a stooge for George Soros what Georgie tells him Johnny does
Another Leach probably hasn't worked a day in his life
As opposed to Trump?
Poor Allen leech are you Tweeting off your Obama phone cuz that's going to be gone soon too
Whatever you say Allen leech. Typical liberal soon as he hears something he doesn't like he starts using typical snowflake language
Awesome! And thank you JM for voting your conscience and No on ACA repeal. We need healthcare!
Please retire John
McCain instead of celebrating baseball celebrate repeal Obamacare
I wish u would keep the promise u campaigned on & the promise I voted for u on. Repeal & replace Obamacare. Vote yes on GCHealthcare bill.
Thank you for protecting health care for thousands of Arizonans. Let’s go to the World Series!
Retire John...you are senile...for once put "Country First"
Liar!

Gonna make it this year!!! 
MacCain has become an obstructionist. He is worse tham Democrats whom at least we know are opposition party. he is traitor from within.
Good luck John and God bless your my favorite Republican honorable honest keep up the good fight and best wishes for you and your family 
The poor people in Arizona absolutely fell for your b******* they have one of the highest Healthcare premiums in the country
A TRUE HERO that stands  out against bully racist, dotard bigot President. You got my respect now.
Dbacks play to win.  Your moves are based on hate.  Do what you ran on.
Screw you McCain I hope they have term limits soon
@SenJohnMcCain I am happy about Dbacks ! But Please vote Yes on repealing ObamaCare ! The tax was so hard on my daughter help AZ vote Yes
Resign now!
You're just as cold-bloodied as Trump. McCain's brain is being attacked, but his heart is as good as gold.
His decision making is obviously faulty. He needs to do what's best for the country now.
Since I'm in FL I probably won't get to see many of their games but keep us posted on their way to victory!
John McCain go put your head in a hole in the ground make the world a better place
Very proud of you and your convictions ! Stay strong sir and please get well! America needs you!
That's just what America needs another traitor
Anyone who disagrees with Trump is a traitor? Sounds like someone with some common sense.
Love me some baseball! #GoCubs see we can disagree and still have respect for the other.
Take a hike McCain. You are a sell out
Please don't send me tweets anymore! Voted for you but your emotions are WAY over the top Will have to contact DNC if you keep it up @POTUS
Go to the top of his profile, click unfollow, no more tweets. It's simple.b
I don't even know who the Diamondbacks are but I'm happy because you're happy. I'm assuming they are a sports team and not the snake.
I'm like Indie and the whole snake thing, lol.
Go @Cubs 
I'll be rooting for the @Dbacks with you!
Got to face Dodgers then my beloved World Champions Da Cubs
RESIGN You BUM !!!
.@SenJohnMcCain, @Dbacks? #JohnMcCain you're our hero in #Arizona! We're, #Democrats & #Rupublicans, proud of your handling of  #Healthcare
Need #FULLREPEAL
Unbelievable.
TRAITOR!!!!
What about the needed YES vote on the Graham bill next week? You have betrayed the people who voted for you in Nov.; we deserve better!
We all deserve better. Unfortunately, we got trump.
You suck!
