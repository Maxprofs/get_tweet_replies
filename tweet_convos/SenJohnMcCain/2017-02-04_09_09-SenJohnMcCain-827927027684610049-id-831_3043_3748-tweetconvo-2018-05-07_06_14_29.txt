Thank you! Keep reminding America who Trump wants to befriend - a man who kills journalists and anyone who opposes him.

@JeffersonObama @WSJ be very afraid of Trump the sitting president assumption that the USA are killers too.
Senator - pls pursue investigation of Russia in a speedy & thorough manner. Thank you.
Can you please retire?  Your a shining example 4 very strict term limits, the MSM can bend you over at will @benshapiro @WSJ

Sponsored by George Soros!
That we know of,,,
@benshapiro Hillary sold OUR uranium to Putin to make herself wealthy. Nuke fuel! And your upset Trump won't say he's bad?

I see many are begging you to #VoteNoDevos That's important but it's CRUCIAL to vote NO #Pruitt. We've nothing w/o  to live.
@SenJohnMcCain
@MeghanMcCain @WSJ John, please get over whatever is eating at you, bud!  We know this has been around forever.
Well said. Unfortunately @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr have shown no backbone in standing up 2 @realDonaldTrump.
.@SenJohnMcCain .@JoeNBC .@WSJ .@nytimes IRAG kills 4x Russia - Syria, Pakistan, Not Word from u 3 Irag kills crAZY
This is what we can expect from Trump in the future when someone disagrees with him.
With all respect when are you going to act on our @POTUS Russia problem?! We can't wait! @LindseyGrahamSC @MaxineWaters
Putin will stop at nothing to silence dissent. At least trump doesn't have that kind of power
thank you for mentioning this! It's not getting enough attention Pleasebring him home b/c ther hospital is not safe 4him
@JoeNBC @WSJ  Putin former KGB trained to understand his opponents, he chose Trump because he is predictable, No surprises!
@JoeNBC @WSJ  Trump won't look stronger than Putin on world stage, he praised him over USA. Putin makes POTUS look weak
And yet you confirmed Tillerson & gave our State Department as a gift to Russian cronies! The irony, and sheer hypocrisy...
Thank you. Will you vote No on DeVos? She avoided answers & omitted payments on ethics docs. Unqualified. Bad for kids.
I'm grateful for your courage. Please continue to stand up for our democracy.
Thank you, Sen. McCain for standing up for the people. You are an honorable man.
@JGSaxon @WSJ Saw it on Rachel last week
yet you voted yes on #RexTillerson
And to think that President Trump helped your campaign. Slithering Snake. A disgrace to America. Does Arizona know?
and yet you confirmed Tillerson, pal to Putin. Put your money where your mouth is. #CountryOverParty
please investigate the connection between trump and Russian government. the american people deserve to know
And yet you endorsed for POTUS a man who constantly praises the gangster Putin
as a veteran,you know how shocking are the actions of Trump. He doesn't seem to have America interests in mind.#noDevos
There is no question regarding this action.
well for god's sake, take action before we end up like Russia.Defend our country! #PresidentBannon
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for amplifying this travesty.  Protect our democracy from @POTUS.
You hold more bi-partisan respect in this country than any other Senator. Please lead the fight for Trump transparency!
Thank you Senator McCain for telling the truth about butcher Putin and murderous Russian kleptocracy!
Putin struck again. You support Trump, Putin's puppet. Put truth & integrity over party. Vote NO on Sessions & DeVos.
Protect our kids!
Stop him from putting unqualified people in important positions NO DEVOS!
He dares to comp the US to Russia "We're not so innocent."  Must be the most disrespectful thing a Pres has ever said!
when do the rest of the GOP show some profiles in courage
Thank you Sen. McCain for revealing the danger in befriending Putin.   I wish our POTUS felt the same way.  Help us 
so what are you doing to stop Russia from running our country through Trump? Where's the investigation?
please vote no.
please vote no on Devos based on her incompetence
@JoeNBC @WSJ John McCain is a fool
I seem to remember something similar happening a few years ago only that man is dead.Thank you for talking about this!
why are we letting this continue with DT. He needs censure
a perfectly times example of how insulting @potus statements on @oreillyfactor were
looks like our media is allowed to report in Russia! What about Iran and China! Never mind all those dissidents vanish!
I'm appealing to you as a decent person you have got to stop Trump putting us all in danger
Kara-Mursa is known as druggie not opp activist.Few ppl know of him.Last time almost died of overdose.Looks lk another1 @wsj
@suepeac @WSJ This would be much more meaningful if we could count on you standing by your critiques. Alas, you never do.
dear sir, please don't let that woman ruin our educational system. Please vote no. Find us someone who has background
@JoeNBC @WSJ Senator, please don't go down this lane.
@JoeNBC @WSJ Putin has something he's holding over trump! Russian blackmail! Nothing w trump would be a shocker. Drama addict
Interested to see what the Russian dirty money through Deutsche Bank uncover.
Please halt his evil. No DeVos No Price.
Thisis what Russia is like! We are NOT like Russia!
And our "president" defends this man. Please bring some honor back to Washington. No unqualified DeVos or corrupt Price
we are not just like Putin!!!Show him- vote against Devos so our children won't be as stupid as our leader.
The Hill agrees with #StopDeVos #draintheswamp Do you?
Trump had a conversation w Putin 're.Ukraine' in Jan. Then Putin upped the military attack there. Where is the GOP?
stop Devos! Do something.
Mccain violated Logan law by calling Australia after Trump to interfere
@JoeNBC @WSJ ... We know u and ur panel are worried and ur criticism of POTUS45 is supposed 2 ... what? I don't get it.
https://twitter.com/PaulaChertok/status/828729435490643968 … any of ya'll getting CONCERNED YET???!! Remember? America? We're the GOOD guys!
Listen to Trump's menacing lies abt "dishonest media" & terrorism. His extremism & propaganda are dangers to America 
Show us how you care about your country by voting against his cabinet appointees. Less talk, more action.
@JoeNBC @WSJ senator me Cain please do something quickly
can't you talk some sense into Donald Trump
@JoeNBC we need you to speak LOUDER. Some of your peers seem to be looking the other way on this, and many other things.
@JoeNBC @WSJ How is that Trump Russian campaign contact/payments/hacking investigation going.
If McCain is involved expect Soros holding the strings. Time to step down, years of failed politics.
@JoeNBC @WSJ want to fight back in a quick way to show that you are against  vote no on DeVos. Start taking back from trump
need I bring back all the DEAD PEOPLE who were around KILLARY AND SLICK WILLIE?
@JoeNBC @WSJ Just another day in Russia apparently.
Speaking of poison...please vote against Betsy DeVos.  She is not qualified, she is bad for our children's future. 
Call me crazy, but I really think that some group in our gvt killed Justice Scalia. So don't act like it we r innocent.
John this is for Russia to deal with OK. Poisoning happens a lot there nothing new. None of our business.
Trump is poisoning America and you are helping him do it. Vote no on #DeVos.
Senator, you're now the liberals champion.  Congratulations.
pot calling the kettle black if i ever was to see it
@RichardGrenell @WSJ Give up your Russian agenda already... paid Soros shill
@Kasparov63 @WSJ SenMcCain Vote no on Devos and all appointments I did see your name on her contribution list$ or countryUSA
Trump's allegiance over the domestic and international interests of The U.S. is reprehensible beyond all measure!
Thank you for being a beacon of hope!! Continue to stand up;we are behind you.
Thank you for bringing this to light.
Senator McCain pls we need your leadership 2 get 2 bottom of Russ hacking of our election&if&how Tr& Tr camp was involv
do you think this is a coincidence? Take away his power.
.@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ #DeVos will poison our education! Do what is right. Put children ahead of campaign contributions #OpposeDeVos #twwnaz
Please do something  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-speaker-address-parliament-a7565651.html …
cheers for them! He doesn't deserve to speak. They listened to their people's protests!
need trump impeached u have the reasons time to act he's not being the president we need all Americans need!
Please tell me you are doing something about Trump before this starts happening to American reporters and activists.
and Trump is best friends it seems with the man who ultimately is responsible. Where the hell is our GOP?
Awareness Trump/Putin threat matters but when a crisis comes will you act against your party and for your country?
Thank you for bringing this out to the public. We need to remember who Putin is.
.@SenJohnMcCain @Kasparov63 @WSJ Senator McCain, your party and Trump's followers seem thrilled to support Putin, Trump and Le Pen.
--- our thoughts are with @vkaramurza and his family. A true Russian patriot!
VOTE NO ON DEVOS!!! SHE IS NOT FIT TO LEAD OUR CHILDREN. OTHERS WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD.
Trump is envious of Putin's power. He wants to bark an order and have a reporter vanish or kill anyone who disagrees.
Please keep investigating the Trump/Moscow connection. 4 Russian IT people and spies dead or missing so far.
Trump adm. tells our journalists to keep their mouths shut. Is poisoning the opposition here in  going to be next?@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ
Pres.doesn't care. not a time for the Rt. to play politics'.We have a disrupted leader/military @ risk,ony money
@MitchMcConell @SpeakerRyan We need to investigate the Russian involvement in our election!!
What on earth does Putin have on POTUS? How can he continue to defend a murdering thug?
Trump respects Putin?!?!?  When is the GOP going to do something about him. He's not KING of the US.
I think.its time you retired Ties with Russia and China might be a good thing
When Trump says that there are a "lot of killers" & he respects Putin, is he telling us how he'll handle his "enemies?"

Trump's praise of Putin (O'Reilly) is clear evidence that he's been bought or compromised. Lift/changes any sanctions=proof!
What are you going to do about this suspicious relationship our president has with Putin? This is an outrage.
send trump for a nice long visit with putin. And vote NO to Devoss
so what about Trump saying we are killers too as he defends Putin? Yet again.
Leninist Steve Bannon is working out for you I guess
Putin is out of your league, stop wasting your time.
you keep complaining about Putin, but do you have a suitable replacement for him ?
what do you think, we are innocent.  Great answer pres.
Pre-Nov were told don't take Trump literally. Should have. Now, US not so different from them? So expect this from him.

#ComradeTrump's lack of Foreign Policy (experience or knowledge) will quickly lead us to war
be carful John, trump is learning from Putin.  I like having you around Navy
We all know better,this man owes the Russian mafia..?? Theres way to much Russian connection with Trump
The American people deserve to know what's going on with this fraud of a president! Wake up Senators!
Another example of Putin being worse than ANY American - POTUS is WRONG comparing us to that monster - pls stand 4 us!
@Artis_Elemental @WSJ And Trump protects murderous Putin , but talks down out a Federal court judge. Wake up senators!!!
@dcjohnson @WSJ we need a secret op to get that poor guy out of Russia
@bejaha @WSJ @realDonaldTrump equated us w/that murderer.Maybe he has a guilty conscience,but former preshaven'tkilledany.
so does that mean we're not killers like Russia? Have you release statement on that, yet?
Dave us, Obi-Wan, you're our only hope. @ChuckGrassley is a shill for @POTUS
Please save us from Trump - you know he is in bed with Putin!!! I am afraid what is happening to this country!
Thank you Sen John McCain our  American hero for bringing this. I couldn't agree with youm more!
please continue to be the voice of honor and honesty. Go Goats!
Has Trump read that his BFF, Putin whom he respects, poisons people? Trump like Bannon thinks it's cool to be a Commie.
Senator McCain, thank you for standing up to our so-called leader. I'm a liberal but I wish you were POTUS right now.
why are u taking money from George Soros?
An much better must-read would be the article about you opposing Trump's nutty nominees
Senator McCain: Be the one. CIA knows. You know. Must call for impeachment before it's too late!
I have followed your career since you were in The House. I am truly happy to have #TheMaverick back Thank you.
@LibbyBlog @WSJ @maddow Rachel had a great segment on this several days ago. Trump and gang need to be terrified of Putin
Putin is a thug/murderer but Castro killed thousands and yet you did nothing, ALEPPO, hmmm what were you sightseeing
I would never vote for you ever
are you really a member of George Soros payroll
@JoyLapine @WSJ yep someone was murdered doing the same thing your doing. Covering for a con. So you wanna fix that John?
Senator: You may be emerging as a hero, for at least the second time in your life. Can we get this guy back to America?
everything that is happening is on GOP heads. You, Sen McCain share responsibility for your friend being on life support.
my was a career military man ... he respected and loved you pls step up now once again for ur country! We need u
