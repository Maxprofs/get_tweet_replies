@MsKadyClark @CBSEveningNews I told y'all this dude wasn't fit to be dawg catcher I was right!
@PressSec @Reince @marcorubio just another Trump ban inconvenience.
@LindseyGrahamSC @timkaine @SenSchumer For Europe, There’s a New Threat in Town: The U.S.
this is tragic!!
@FonzoBoyz @CBSEveningNews Perhaps if we hadn't created Al Queda and launched wars of aggression #ISIL wouldn't exist.
.@ShelbyKentStewa @CBSEveningNews @SenJohnMcCain,it's obvious DT/Bannon r leading us down path of destruction. Can't you stop this madness?
we need more moderate GOPers like you to curb a hubristic executive putting us on a dangerous security & ethical trajectory
Thank you for your service and sacrifice during the Vietnam war.  The U.S. has voted. Step aside, new sheriff in town. TRUMP!
the Iraqi army leaves a lot to be desired.
what develops a terrorist is usually their liveing conditions.upon their desperations religion is a badge of their propaganda
Senator McCain, where is the outrage from your fellow GOP senators. Pathetic.
@Lora4justice @CBSEveningNews 
Thank you Sir, but you need to stand up more.
Yes @Brooklynwatch More, please @SenJohnMcCain And get busy building a coalition to resist.
why don't you guys stop Trump from all his ridiculous policies!!
.@SenJohnMcCain @AaronMehta @CBSEveningNews  DO SOMETHING. 25th Amendment. #ImpeachTrump
ur such an Obama lackey. Its Friggen ISIS, not ISIL. Don't u have another meeting with Soros to get to, RHINO
Wrong on Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt & claim to intimately know ISIS Can we trust your judgement on terror NO
thank you for standing up for real American values! #StopPresidentBannon

Then u should HELP POTUS & quit acting like his ENEMY sir! I respect you but I don't like how u treat PDT.
just like you want to treat russia like an enemy when we need them as partner against #ISIL @SenJohnMcCain
hope you and others don't wait too long
The first sensible thing you have said in years.
can we cry a tear?
You got it. Trump creating international havoc! Impeach!. Unqualified and dangerous!
#AllTalk So you'll be leaving the GOP then?
he already has!!!!
Are you going to take responsibility if ISIS terrorists infiltrate the refugee program due to lacks vetting?
Embarrassing. Meanwhile, POTUS on twitter rant about fake news (over and over) DO SOMETHING. Downward spiral!
@sjferg1252 @CBSEveningNews Correct, sir. Now what action will you take?
@AaronMehta @CBSEveningNews Your Guy you made him . Now we all have to deal Thanks GOP
We need all countries,including Russia, to help us take down ISIS.May not agree with them but we need them. Ban is good start
since when is Iraq an ally? That would be my 2nd nuke target
Help...we're frightened, we need some sanity in the Oval Office!
Hey LIBTURD McCAIN... IT ISIS not ISIL... #draintheswamp
Another bad tweet John!  Stick to the ones that help our President. He is in a fire-fight, cover his back!!
ISIL or ISIS?  You are using Obama's term for this.
quit being instant critic, lend support and stop grandstanding. Enough already!
Headlines are Trump eases sanctions against country attacking US ally. What part of corrupt are U missing?
.@CBSEveningNews Mr. @SenJohnMcCain I hope you realize that Trump is trying to radicalize more Muslims, to justify his beliefs and his war.
Obama and Hilary created them, funded them armed them and trained ISIL, Trump will destroy them!
why don't you and the rest of Congress do something about it. Stand up to DJT.
you are right Senator.
So horrible and unfair. DJT thinks it's ok to treat allies like enemies. He cannot keep us safe this way. #Resist
Please do something. #Trump needs to be impeached. #RussianTies #Unfit #reckless #impeachment
c'mon mccain! Vlad is not happy with you! get with the pogrom or your new boss will be ANGRY!
WHY are you supporting Trump? You know he is dangerous to the USA and the world!
I respect you for this,  but you guys need some balls when it comes to Trump. Is the party more important than the country?
so, we had these allies for 8 years. When did we defeat ISIS? And, youre using ISIL? These day? Interesting..

if puppet masters are really planning a cue aka CNN opinion the Senate is the heart of the Republic.
thank you hero John McCain for standing up for America
When we have an immature, everything is black or white, no gray, then Yes we are making even more enemies!
Senator, please help us! The President & Bannon are dangerous, provocative, and incompetent! Fear is their tool. Pls step up!
Don't worry, in a few weeks we won't have any allies.
twitter talk doesn't help unless you're going to DO something about it. We need a voice of reason.
The United states need to start somewhere to get control back. Good place as any
I'm glad to see your response. The ethical  members of  the Republican party need to call Trump on this!
@a_picazo @CBSEveningNews VOTE AGAINST IT THEN.
Its just ridiculous. I understand standing up to missile tests.But to just outright ban a religion? Its Crazy
@pastor_bd @CBSEveningNews What will you DO about it, Senator?
this president is treating our enemies like allies and allies like enemies. He's going to bring us into war
@ZahedMod @CBSEveningNews #thanksorangefuckstick
Please impeach TRUMP! Supreme Court judges won't matter if we lose our democracy!!!!!
You knew that @realDonaldTrump was unfit but it was #PartyOverPeople
@LogisticsDTNET @CBSEveningNews @johnmccain talks alot but when he votes does absolutely nothing to oppose Trump.
What are you doing? Giving the WH carte blanche. Yes votes at every turn.The people deserve better
Senator, it's ISS NOT ISIL. Makes you sound like Obama.
are you kidding it's called respect Mr. Trump
Come on John McCain, Lindsey Graham.
Lead the way to impeachment while you still can. Make history now !
.@SenJohnMcCain @CBSEveningNews cool so will you block Trump's nominees until the ban is rescinded and Bannon steps down?
doesn't what's happening with the trump administration scare the nickers off you?  I know I'm really worried
. Agreed. So stop supporting the president's henchmen.
You could, y'know, propose legislation or something. I hear Senators can do things like that!
#AllTalk #PartyBeforeCountry
@LauraVanVleet There is no "I" in Democracy! You can not be a leader if people do not follow you.

And why go to the families of officials Hola America?
@alexbojalil @CBSEveningNews now millions of new enemies to the #USA
One of the most stupid decision I ever seen. The first front against DAESH are muslims allies
exactly!!
your best friend who buys lots of weapon from you! Rats.
dear sir can get your email to send you urgent thing plz
The ultimate real estate development project - rebuild the world. #DrEvil
It's part of 45's reboot plan. #DrEvil
Thank you for speaking standing up to the insanity.
also your tweet shows top politicos are no different than Person in street. So how about less bullying us & swaggering about.
why then do you support @realDonaldTrump You must have been at table when his border junk was cooked up.
Do something.
30September2011-15 May2013 with OSCI, and 16May2013 as Internet provider,I became the best of the providers
tell they decide to red flag me and kick me off base
you a a traitor to the republican party. take off the mask & call what you are - a democRAT
I support American troops in Taji Iraq as a Training interpreter since 2004-30 September 2011
what has happened to being moral and ethical? That is what should guide your decisions. Do something!
That's an audacious statement, sad to learn that it came from you, Mr. McCain. Just an off the wall statement
Muslims fighting other Muslims is common for followers of Mohammed's political imperialistic ideology.
Mr. McCain, he was delayed, not denied. Please don't act like a politician. Help the President, please.
You are either part of the problem or part of the solution. It looks like you are on the problem side. Change
exceptions to this order are pursued for interpreters and others.  Why whine and tweet?  Get it done!
COME ON NOW. YOU ARE AIDING AND ABETTING. STOP THE BS NOW AND GIVE THE NATION YOUR SUPPORT FOR A CHANGE
@donmoyn @CBSEveningNews This is outrageous.
What a sad statement about American values. "Innocent until proven guilty" when did we lose that belief?
- give EM what for SENATOR Mc Cain at least I know there's one man of bravery in Washington, D.C. !!!!!!!!!!!
Why not be a part of the solution rather than create more division? Stand with USA
Current WH is mean as hell but at same time seems like amateur night. That really bothers me, makes me feel unsafe.
How do you differentiate between enemies and allies when your enemies are your allies too? ....
@txmetroasdfw Mccain why dont you let the refugees live with you. Heros dont get captured! liberal neo con
Sour grapes. Lost respect for you & @LindseyGrahamSC in your relentless criticism of Pres Trump.
thx for saying the truth always! McCain is a true Maverick!
@wtf_imtooold @CBSEveningNews McCain! This is your party committing hostile coup! Do something! History & God will judge you!
Impeach.  Convict.  Imprison.  Investigation into Russian influence/Trump ties?  Tax returns?
The Special Ops Medical Assoc invited 2 Peshmerga general officer docs in May. Now they'll have to cancel!!!
Maybe time for a sequel to the EO that may serve as lessons learned....win-win can emerge with add'l fidelity
@SamanthaJPower @CBSEveningNews Hey, Republicans! If you don't start to control this regime, you're gonna be judged harshly!
@SamanthaJPower @CBSEveningNews So don't cooperate with the dangerous agenda. Stand up. Please.
Have you asked Jeff Sessions about this?
You voted for him, he’s your problem. @SamanthaJPower
@SamanthaJPower @CBSEveningNews #Impeachment
THEN YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR SESSIONS.
You voted for this guy knowing he was mentally unfit! You, too, put party over country.
yup
@MikeMedavoy @CBSEveningNews ok folks what a wacky world when we are rt'ing McCain.
I am so saddened by what you have become: a liberal 
thank you sir! #Stevebannon has taken over policy & thought.  I'm so grateful you are here !
thank you senator McCain!  Many Arizonans are with you #twwnaz
Something strange. if General vetted, he would be allowed to travel - 852 allowed in from "banned countries"
Please help stop this lunacy, Senator. Compromise is key to good democracy. This isn't that. Stand strong.
Thank you @JohnMcCain for standing with the American majority. #StraightTalk #NoBanNoWall
Thank you, Senator McCain.  I am 61 year old life-long hard core Democrat.  I appreciate you greatly.
Stay with your wingman or you'll get in trouble.
thank you for being THE ONLY VOiCE of REASON in the Republican Party presently.
@John_Scotus @CBSEveningNews with all due respect senator one phone call noting the mistake and it will be corrected #GETREAL
tell me John 20 yrs of war with Iraq and we're still there, how helpful can he be or any of  them.
can't defeat them when you meet with this guy
I see you call them Idol like Obama did, really why don't u just say you're a democratic.
John play nice.
#fightthefear
our current POTUS is dangerous. We need your wisdom and help.
I served 2 tours several Iraqis of all ranks turned on us over there VET them all extremely
John McCain, you got my respect, and I'm a liberal. Keep fighting to keep America great 
your one of the few republicans with sense lately John
@alwaysfreevoice 
John, stop tweeting and do something about it.
Please fight for America,Senator. @POTUS is not a good man nor worthy to be our leader
Fact is sir, @SenJohnMcCain for 8 yrs this has been happening under your watch ...shameful.. Shameful. 

@CBSEveningNews
and the blood will be on the GOP hands because everyone of yous have failed to stop him!
Senator-we republicans are pulling together to move this country forward. Show proper leadership as senior member to unite
More BS from McCain & media. Exemptions can and have been granted. Make America safe again.
Not true at all, could arrive here under many protocols, either visiting or officially as General
Bush league administration.  I hope it's just rookie mistakes.
I really hope the GOP stands up and supports what's right over ideology.Bipartisanship has NEVER been more important than now
#draintheswamp I think the @POTUS includes you in that swamp Senator. Time to say bye bye.
this is serious business. Reality show stunts endanger our troops.
Iraq is not an ally, your lies are pitiful.
I prefer my senators "not captured."
thank you for this.   Don't take eyes off Russia. Eyes on Dons circle. I'm just some guy, plz do you. Don making us weaker
I have almost nothing in common w/you politically but I want to thank you for taking country over party against Muslim ban
@joshrogin @CBSEveningNews omg!
senator McCain thank u for standing up for the American people & fighting against fascism. Please keep it up.
haven't they proven to be at times?  better safe than sorry.
So do something about it. Country over party! Be a leader for EVERYONE.
well U helped this!
@SpeakerRyan @SenMajorityLdr other than the few who have spoken out when will party leaders put country first?
OK WARMONGER. Shouldn't u B picking on Putin, trying to start WWIII so u can protect ur precious petrodollar?
Please Sen.McCain help our country ! Put America before Politics! Trump keeps humiliating you , not right!
yep. I'm a kiwi and I've voluntarily cancelled my trip to Disneyland with kids. Too much crap in the US now.
Trump also banned all the Friends of J McCain whom he armed asTerrorists in Iraq, Syria, Libya
Don't worry, he should understand and will get over it. Send him a gift basket.
You are so AWESOME Mr. McCain!
Just retire Mr.McCain. We thank you for your services military and all, but you need rest now. Go to bed.
And just how long was he detained. Why don't you get on the Republican agenda and support the President.
If Iraqis are too dangerous to be in the US, why does US allow 5000 US troops in Iraq? Are they safein the midst of Iraqis?
Thank you for standing up to the Muslim ban. It would make us less safe and insults those who helped us.
get out of Soros wallet and do the job the people hired you to do please
Sen McCain, when Obama made u his bitch back when, you're ok. With POTUS you need a safe pin?
You are a traitor against our President. Your nothing but a prisoner of war not a Hero
Where ur outrage of Sen DEMS boycotting @realDonaldTrump nominees. Your alliance is sad. U are sad. Retire now we hate u.
Take a stand against this dangerous administration. Build a bipartisan coalition.
please do the right thing and stand up to Trump/Bannon.

thank you for all your speaking out! Now,please I beg u walk your talk and vote no to #muslimban & bad cab.picks.Stay strong!
