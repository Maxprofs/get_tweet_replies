Again, many thanks to the wonderful Iranian-American community in #Arizona for the birthday wishes!
NOT American-Iranian, but Iranian-Americans! Are they US Citizens? NO!
Dear Sir,
I feel very confident on your 100% recovery.
You are recovered from your illness that's the next hit news.
I am praying for you.
Happy Birthday Mr, McCain...  A true American hero!  I hope you're feeling well.
Lol not on healthcare!
To many many people....  he is a hero on healthcare as well as defending our country in war and threats to our dignity.  Show some respect.
To Democrats and Obama supporters! He campaigned on repeal and replace! One big lie lime Obama!
Many many many people are benefited by the ACA and want to keep most of it...  and nothing you say is going to change that.
Happy birthday to dear senator McCain one of the great supporters of freedom for Iranian people. God bless you and your family.
You are my favorite Republican. You always do what you think is right, not rightwing. Thank you for your long career and being brave. A Dem.
