Please continue to support NATO. Republicans can have different points of view. Don't be sheep following blindly along.
You two deserve each other.
@JohnKasich is it true U and Kasich were on Clintons payroll to stop Trump?
When will any Politician truly stand up for veterans instead of writing unless letters every 2 months https://www.facebook.com/pretty.ricky.75/videos/1068569686588461/ …
won't stand up for you he could care less about VETS it's proven with failure he's a fat rich white guy #Loser
@JohnKasich Two men of integrity. Thank you for speaking the truth even though there may be a price for doing so.

Stand strong. Protect NATO. Protect the CIA. Look into the Russian connection. Don't let Putin have the last laugh.
@JohnKasich thank you!  i'm Dem but great fuel for McCain!
He should have been the nominee.  A normal person who doesn't throw 5tantrums and doesn't tweet about every little slight.
@JohnKasich
Really like Kasich
I once had respect for u&even voted for u,but I lost all respect for u last wk when u sent the fake Dossier to CNN! Disgrace!
@JohnKasich if you want to support NATO you can't possibly support Tillerson cc @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC
#media #jornalismo say
#TrumpPresidente is a consequence of 8 years lies by #obama 

& #socilaist support for #islamist jiha
:Please help POTUS grasp the importance of ethical standards in our http://Democracy.You  have always had courage&principles

look at these two washed up old men you have become irrelevant now you can go join the Democratic Party effing losers
please consider security threat of trump having access to secure info and then tweeting it on impulse or or vengeance
@JohnKasich two irrelevant pals
@JohnKasich keep supporting NATO!  Preserve our crucial relationships globally.
@JohnKasich Please don't let Trump destroy our allies relationships; he doesn't understand American values.
@JohnKasich Johns we can't count on you guys! Can't keep you word!!
Are you going to boycott today with the Liberals or are you going to put on your 2nd face and go?
Mr. MasSeyn, the world is waiting for when you will leave American politics! Such as you are able to destroy our whole world.
Mr.McCain, the world is waiting for when you will leave American politics! Such as you are able to destroy our whole world.
@realdonaldtrump MEXICANS ARE BOASTING THAT THEY ARE TAKING BACK THEIR BORDERS!  UNACCEPTABLE!!!!  THEY MUST BE WATCHED!
@realdonaldtrump AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING INVADED BY THIRD WORLD, WE WANT OUT COUNTRY BACK NOW!!!!!
@realdonaldtrump @SenJohnMcCain NO ONE BLOCKS TRUMP!  NO ONE!  HE IS THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!

@JohnKasich One of these men is staying true to his vision, other is intimidated by Trump into doing what he knows is wrong.
@JohnKasich Beautiful! Two very decent, and respectable GOPs. Thank you for your class, dignity, and dedications.
horrible job having vets arrested for protesting Tillerson! U will get burned for this & supporting the horrid DJT #impeach
@JohnKasich two awesome Americans!!

Do your job John quit sounding like obama I Me  I Me
I see you are learning your lesson McCain.  Support Trump or you are gone.  Tilerson is a good start. Bow before your leader.
John Kasich should be taking the oath tomorrow instead of Donald! And I  am a Democrat!
@JohnKasich  then please stand up for them no matter the administration @StJohnsCtyREC @DuvalGOP @DuvalDEC
@JohnKasich why did you have these veterans arrested? They are right. Vote NO on Rex Tillerson. http://www.alternet.org/john-mccains-office-sics-police-veterans-demanding-he-reject-rex-tillersons-confirmation …
@JohnKasich 

Two losers holding each other up

@JohnKasich im@not a republican.And sometimes disagree with you both.But I love and commend you both for being patriotic men
Two Great Patriots!
please be diligent, Trump doesn't even have enough staff in place to react, scary.
@JohnKasich Neither of you show country unity and support.Actions speak louder then words.
@JohnKasich Seriously Democrats are throwing tantrums? After 8 yrs  of Repub  obstruction you have no room to criticize!!
concern about tillerson?? Where was that concern when u handed over info to vietcong that got people killed?? Give me a break
here are two reasons why we have mr trump, there are others. U can bet this mtg is not for good purposes. Be warned Donald
I believe the best person for the job as secretary of state is Mr. Romney.
@JohnKasich Good luck, gentlemen. We are counting on principled conservatives like yourselves to keep us all safe.
@JohnKasich The white RINO isn't going extinct. Dems hate you but will use you for the next 4 years.  #Trump will #MAGA
what a president he would have been!
@JohnKasich   The man who SHOULD be taking the oath of office tomorrow.  #MangoMoussillini
War!  What is it good for?  Filling @SenJohnMcCain pockets!  Keep the bombs coming you war mongering pos
I expected more from you
@JohnKasich Looking for a job John
@JohnKasich Trump took Arizona and Ohio without the help of either one of these chumps!
Do you know the House is giving away the land around the Grand Canyon? Do something!
@JohnKasich please step up on other issues tha majority care about also.
@JohnKasich two good decent guys meeting!
@JTTiene @JohnKasich  Honorable men who put country before party. We need more like you!  Thank you so much for your courage!
@JohnKasich for the love of God, stay strong and fight the evil that is about to be our president!
PLEASE don't vote for Rex Tillerson. His ties to Putin are too strong.
Two RINO Trump haters. Shut up and go away! Zero credibility.
Gov.John Kasch of Ohio

@JohnKasich John McCaun how dare you have war veterans arrested today. You work for the people. You should be ashamed.
@JohnKasich I support and admire you both. Stand for what is right!!!
@JohnKasich here's 2 American traitors together. Wish they'd both go away.
@JohnKasich you are my favorite 2! Please do not vote for the questionable & unqualified tillerson, duvos, or price
5 trillion over 5 years? You sir are killing America and when it happens it will be your bad
