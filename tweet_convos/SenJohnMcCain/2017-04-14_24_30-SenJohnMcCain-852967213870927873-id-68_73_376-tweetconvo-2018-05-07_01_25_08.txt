Can you stop Trump now, please!  He's going to get us all killed.  Congratulations on the medal and thank you!
President Trump is not the problem. The bullies in Syria, North Korea and other people killing their own people.
Hang it next to Obama one.  Time to retire
I don't care for parties but I admire you standing by your principles and confronting #Trump
Yeah where has he actually voted against trump?  Name one?
Congrats Mr. McCain!
Help us! That madman has pissed off No. Korea who are saying they will launch a pre-emptive strike. We don't even have a real Secy of State!
Well, I'll give you this;  McCain is NOT SOS
Traitor.
A country w/ many reported human rights violations, whose leader has some really sketchy criminal ties, is okay bcuz it is a US ally, right?
Oh, Ha! I thought you were talking about the U.S.
That's fantastic! I think you should move there! Americans tired of RINO's. #traitor #songbird
NAILED IT
The most boring action figure in the world is "Integrity John McCain" No skills. No powers. Breaks into pieces the second the press leaves
You should get one from saudi arabia next warmonger.  Since you want to send us to fight their wars.
Thanks for saying that!
Congratulations. Please support an independent investigation. Please put country before party. Please have your actions support your words.
This is well said. Thanks.




Dear #Senator, #recent action in dealing with #MEK firmly #condemn and call for #support of #opposition #leader #RezaPahlavi 's #Iran Rials.
yes!
How did you keep a straight face when you received that medal, warmonger? Get all the medals you can, you are still a TRAITOR and not SOS
Do you support the American Spring?
Dear Vlad, The #ArabSpring is coming to a neighborhood near you:  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204770404577077711550134028.html?mod=WSJ_World_LeadStory â€¦
Can you please stop voting against the American people's freedoms?
How about fighting 4 freedom in our own country by opposing the derelict of a president we have? Where has your honor gone?
Congratulations Senator.
such a joke.
well deserved Senator!
Senator McCain, For Service to our Great Nation, and your Military sacriface to maintain our Freedom , You will always be an American Hero.
Is that for abetting foreign espionage against the US?
congratulations!
if you hadnt claimed torture after failed heli jump, give up military secrets, you might have one that actually matters. You know from U.S
#partyovercountry sellout

Wow! Another medal! For what!
Hey don't forget to buy 100 of @McCainJack new book and hand it around Congress 
Did you tell them you are a senile old man that speaks for no one?
you are the personification of the devil in my eyes
Congratulations Sen. McCain... thank you for your previous and current service to our country
Senator, do you think you could do us all a big favor and stay over there? Pretty, pretty please!
They have Maker's Mark? (I've given up on McCain.)
That makes you a Kosovo spy and you should be made to be suspect in everything you do from now on... oh wait ... I thought I was a Liberal
And remember when our current POTUS said you were not a hero? Because he likes guys that were not captured. Impeach the illegitimate potus
@SenJohnMcCain Apparently doesn't care Trump bashed his commitment to country, which gives me pause to wonder what kind of man accepts that?
Trump's taxes now.
LOL. Now do that medal some justice and put country over party
