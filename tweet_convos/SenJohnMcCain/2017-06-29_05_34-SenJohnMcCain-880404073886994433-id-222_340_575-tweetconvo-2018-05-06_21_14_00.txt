Thanks for bringing #montenegro front & center.  USA needs to reveal all about last election. Stone/Manaforte/Russians, something serious.
Your words mean nothing if you fail to act every time. Help stop Trump. Help us end his reign of terror.
How's your wife like her bribe? Er. I mean job
MAKE NO MISTAKE
IT HAS ALREADY STARTED!
TRUMP,SESSIONS AND OTHER PATRIOTS ARE TRUE PATRIOTS& THEY KNOW HOW TO WIN THIS USA BACK,!
The only place you get attention anymore is the LMSM. Ever wonder why that is You like Kerry have BS the public for too long & You know it.
All you do is feign outrage after every controversy and then fall right back into line w/Trump. Susan Collins is a Maverick, not you.
That's great. 

Now DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR 
ACTIONS& INACTIONS!
SPENDING FED $$ WILDLY 
ON 
CORRUPTED,WASTEFUL,UNECESSARY PROJECTS 
NOW!
I am so confused by this article. You and your party deny and obstruct An investigation of Russia Collision.  Please explain
IT IS A GLOBAL WAR,
BUTaREVOLUTIONwthinTHAT HASbeenSTARTED BY THE; LEFT,DEMS, CROOKED POLITICIANS,OPPOSITION,ORGZD CRIME,&THE RUSSIAN AGENTS
Have you considered impeachment? You do that and we'll clean up the House & Senate.
After all you've done Senator, it's sad to see your legacy reduced to that of a supporter of treason  and the fraud who gave  to enemy
I agree   Why won't some Republicans acknowledge this?
And again I ask: WHEN WILL YOU DO SOMETHING. We have a crook and liar in the WH and all you do is talk.
He must have something to hide too, maybe Putin blackmailed him too,
and 
I used to really admire him 
u back an American territory, American's running there government in south Syria and Iraq since Assad using chemical weapons
You care Graham and Grassley and doing everything they can to cover up
And what are you doing about it?
You talk the talk but you tow the party line. #thisisnotokay
@SenJohnMcCain You, sir, are all talk and no nothing...you are a shell of the great man you used to be.  I am ashamed of you.
BUT WE NEED TOTAL 
UNWAVERING
SUPPORT
FOR THEM

WE NEED TO RID/VOTE OUT
THESE COMPROMISED OFFs
THE,ALTERNATIVE IS THATourUSA IS THE
ONLY COUNTRY GREAT ENOUGH 2 OVERCOME OUR FOREIGN ENEMIES SO WE R LEFT WITHtheONLY CHOICE
2 STAND&FIGHT
If you truly believe that, then you need to do something about the collaborators in the WH.  You have power, USE IT.
@SenJohnMcCain lost his will when his wife went to work for DT. Sad to see an honorable man lose it. Sad indeed
I'm not sure whether that's actually happened yet.  But I am still hopeful he was take a stand.
Doesn't help that #Trump shoved the Montenegro leader out of his way during the #NATO summit. #Viral
As he should!
You support Trump and his agenda.  You knew what you were getting.
Ben Arnold was a hero once, but how do we remember him? You're acting awful treasony...
When the USA bombed innocent Serbs to protect mujahedin in the Balkans who was the threat then?
Now go investigate the people who have died around the Clintons!
And McCain is doing what about it? Writing op-ed pieces is ok but if he only had the power of being a senator ...
Get ur act 2gether senator, u r validating and enabling this manchild evil havoc on this country every second you do not call 4 impeachment
YES,

And yet inexplicably the president @realDonaldTrump seems to want to pivot toward a unified policy with them & GOP house is antisanction
You should publicly state that Trump wants to ignore this because he could not have won without their help, and needs their help in 2020.
If you believe this, stop support of Trump and his agenda NOW. He is dragging you and GOP down. What would Reagan think of this vulgar man?
Yet the @GoP voted the Friend of Russia recipient as Sec of State. #complicit much?
Then why is @ChuckGrassley & @LindseyGrahamSC attacking FBI instead of letting them do investigation. #complicit #partyovercountry #traitors
We know.  Who will protect us from Russia?  Certainly not his puppet Trump or his puppets corrupt cronies...
Russia is no threat unless you believe Americans are too stupid to seek out truth.  Okay, I'm discounting Democrats.
I have lost all confidence in you. I thank you for your military service, but it's time for you to go home.
You're always the best!
Thank you, Mr Senator, for your important oped article.
I think we get it. How long will you be in office? Might it be best to allow a younger individual to have a chance to do your job? Let us in
Your more of a threat than Russia!
Why have you let DDT/Putin take over our democracy?? Why? Why?
Article 25
Yeah YOU are full of it!
Lead the charge Sir. The president is a guppy in a sea of sharks
Or maybe Georgia, Ukraine, Crimea, Syria, US/French election meddling. NO SHIT RUSSIA IS A THREAT! Tell the GOP. Americans already know.
AND YET U PROTECT THIS PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT CARE AT ALL AND FOR WHAT REASON??? I WOULD THINK U WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHY! U PROTECTED HIM!!!
Stand up for America. Put #CountryOverParty and get rid of Trump who if he has his way will make the USA a suburb of Russia. #ImpeachTrump
Sessions met the Russians then lied to Congress about it.  Trump had been doing business with the Russians for years.  @RepAndyBiggsAZ
Mike Flynn, Kushner, Manafort.  So many ties between Trump and Russia.  What is going on, Mr McCain ?
Thanks for speaking up Mr McCain. Many republicans are covering for Trump.  I believe it's a republican coverup. They deny Trumps ties.
The Trump/Russia collusion story is based on a lie.  The effort to undermine the Trump presidency is a bigger threat
there will be a coup here in September while trump shuts down government, putin will send troops, trump will stand down armed forces
Can you read it out loud to that nitwit in the Oval Office?  He can't read, but needs to know.  He thinks they are our ally.
Your brain is apparently still working, Senator, but your backbone seems to have atrophied.  Put up or shut up.
Okay, John. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT TRUMP & PUTIN'S COLLUSION. THE DEMOCRACY YOU FOUGHT FOR IS IN JEOPARDY!
How's Cindys new job?  Does the peotus say she has a nice smile?
I think you need to get "Your People" the GOP to reduce this president and his cozy Putin connections.
Why don't you stop flapping your yap and DO something McCain?
then call for impeachment, Senator!!!
Then do SOMETHING and really stand up to the bully! Your constituents need you to stand up to Trump! Show you still have a backbone
He IS doing something! He's being "concerned"!!!
No one reads USAToday, they just look at the pretty color pictures... how are you supposed to get your point across through that pub?
Too bad Trump doesn't think they are a threat. He's trying to do away with sanctions already. They deserve more sanctions. Will you stand up
So what steps are you taking to force the Trump administration to recognize the Russia threat?
Then do something about it Senator!
We and our allies have been cyber-attacked by Russia. We continue to do nothing!!
#TrumpRussia
What are you doing about It? Why is GOP complicit? Why are you complicit with the enemy. The enemy. Why?
Are you doing whatever needs done, TODAY, to get the Senate Sanctions through the House process to protect us? @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader
We have a Putin tool sitting in the Oval http://Office.you  are a powerful senator.when are you going to do something? O right,never.
Little too late. GOP allowed trump to spew hoax for so long nothing will change their mind.
25thAmendment
You or any of your staff follow Trump on twitter??  If so, good... That's where following this ape must end. He is retarded. Period.
Uregant move by Trump
What a hypocrisy senator. You did nothing during Obama, nothing! Now you act if you had won the presidency. Respect my president @POTUS
Then blame Hillary and Obama for mocking Mitt Romney when he told America what real threats were. Where were you in supporting narrative?
Put your money where your mouth is, Senator. Hasn't your wife accepted a position in this crooked cabinet?
Then sir, do something. Start at the top.
If you want to stop putins march against our country, you will have to get rid of trump, his friends & family. Otherwise, he will continue
What are YOU doing abt protecting IS from RU again?! Pressure the House to move the bill
And Trump pushed the guy. When are you going to do something and stop your expressed "concern," followed by "reluctant" acceptance
You all have got to do something about him - as I've said for 2 years he is unstable not fit. The man needs help - extensive therapy
Sen. McCain...When are we going to deal with this awful President who tweets like a 4 yo?   Our country is suffering and losing respect!
Great article but you and BFF @LindseyGrahamSC have not been putting pressure on. As a matter of fact this is worrisome! Show us protect us!
Better make the @gop get a hold of your boy donnie!
If you believe this then stop Trump agenda until investigation is concluded.If DT had any collusion everything,everyone appointed is invalid
Yep! So is removing access to healthcare!
Threat? They already attacked and continue to do so but you're too busy voting how their Russian puppet tells you2. Shame you wasted career
Man ... I'm glad your fighting for American.... and all its peoples
IDK what u have 2 do but stop that orange from meeting w/Putin. He'll sell the rest of our democracy 4 magic beans.
Do your job Senator or get out of the way.
Get off your Russia bandwagon and leave it to the professionals to handle.
Then be the independent voice for our democracy
Too bad your compatriots don't see this. When will they wake Up?!
Trump doesn't care. Russia is profiting and Trump admires a good deal no matter the consequences.
Would rather read "From Russia with Love".  Better fiction.  John, refocus on your job.
Mr McCain, thank you for citing seriousness of Russian meddling. Please stop supporting 45's WH, which clearly supports Russia more than US.
At least a Russian agent isn't in the WH though right? That'd be a disaster.
Putin must go away or must die.I prefer the second.
You just need to persuade your own leader of that.
I'm sorry no thanks. IF you loved this country you would retire. You are not all there for this job
Thank you! How could 50 years of Cold & Hot Wars not be a lesson?
ok AND? What are you going to do about it besides shake your fist and interrupt Senator Harris?
What are you going to do about it @SenJohnMcCain
Maybe you should focus on Trump, who could give a shit, and BTW is president.
Thank you again for your past and continuing service to our country. We are all Americans first.
Why not put some pressure on the House sir?
We get it Senator. We are looking to you and your colleagues to take care of it. You have disappointed so far.
Then do something about it and choose country over party.
You continue to back POTUS who not only supports  but pushed that man out of the way like he was a sack of rotten potatoes @ NATO summit.
Are you organizing the @gop for impeachment? Yes or no.
John get over it already !
Please don't let him meet with Putin!!!!
Dereliction of presidential duties.      Start applying pressure.  Vote on nothing til sanctions commensurate with interference.
Great. Now what? What's the next step??
Where's your oped on #SinglePayer  healthcare?  If you vote FOR #Trumpcare #BCRA  your legacy will be destroyed.
It's the economy stupid.
Would someone PLEASE explain that to @realDonaldTrump .... again!
Is McCain taking his meds?
I want ALL Russians expelled from my country.
I want RT and their fringe fake news sites blocked.
Remove traitor Trump from office NOW! 
Senator, use your power and influence to stand up to the "president" who is ignoring his duty to preserve, protect & defend us from Russia
Thank you for this compelling op ed.
Thank you, @SenJohnMcCain  Now what are we doing to get the House Republicans to move the sanctions bill forward?
I hear sanctions against Russia has been stalled. That concerns us.
Thank you, sir, for at least saying that Russia is a big deal.
@SenJohnMcCain then DO something about it.  Talk is cheap.
He's worthless when standing up to his party when he knows they are wrong. Pathetic.
Then impeach the orange one
Vote no on TrumpCare @SenJohnMcCain @USATODAY
THIS. This. He's bringing up every talking point to not talk about the deathcare bill.
Lovely NOW STOP DIVERTING AND GET BACK TO HEALTHCARE! I know what you're doing. 1st immigrants, 2nd Defense Budget, now Russia. HEALTHCARE!!
Then do something about it against potus
Great article, all the more reason to get to the truth about who owes Putin favors within our administration and clean house! We must resist
Why won't you release your top donors list. #songbird
Thanks John. Maybe next time you can ask some legit questions during the hearings instead of protecting 45.
Stumbling over Hillary comments with Comey. This is what we get from McCain.
Sir , how do you get through the heads of trump and company ? Are they oblivious or devious ? I believe the later
Yes it is. But you continue to support and enable a WH ( @potus and @VP ) that does not agree with you.  Why enable those opposed to you?
Sir, please stand strong for the good of our country. trump is a horrible president. But, actions speak louder than words. #LiarInChief
I believe Russia is a threat to the US but I wonder if you aren't also a threat to our country. I'm sorry but you need to retire. Please!!

.@RandPaul: "I've said since the very beginning, I think the whole Russia thing about Trump and Russia is a witch hunt." 
Tell TRUMP THAT,NOT US.HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE US WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS HACKED US. DERELICTION OF DUTY NOT TO PROTECT US.
u should go on Fox & Friends so @POTUS @realDonaldTrump learn about this plot. U know he doesn't read! Trumpsters wont believe u either
LET IT GO
If only u could convince your good buddy Trump of this. Why waste your time tweeting about it & go over to the WH and tell him man-to-baby?
Because he's diverting the conversation away from deathcare.
Yet your C in C is buddies with Putin and as long as this the case your treading water. Have guts to stop Trump. USA,USA
Please do stop trying to start WWIII!
He won't be the one to start it.  That will be Russia and NK's job.
Gooo away John. Maybe YOU should be Investigated with your Soros ties!!
You keep talking, Senator. When will you actually DO something? Or is that not how it’s done?
Montenegro. Didn't Trump shove aside the Prime Minister at the Nato Summit?  Just sayin
yep. Same one.
John, PLEASE HELP to free Americans from Trump's destructive behaviors!
Is that rhetorical? And what are the government's "wings"?
