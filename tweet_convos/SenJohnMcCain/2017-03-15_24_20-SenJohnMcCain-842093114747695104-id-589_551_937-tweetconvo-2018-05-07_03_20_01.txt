I see this shit everywhere. That photo is John meeting with FSA. The FSA are one of the groups fighting ISIS
He is not right there is nothing like FSA in Syria . Those are Al Nura Fighters, if you don't mind I can give you their names.
Imagine MSM was quick to condemn "sarin" attack which was orchestrated by the terrorists themselves. But you know the attack was all lies.
McCain?Your on @HouseIntelComm Wheres Benghazi case,HRCSOS case,you as Intel meeting with&fake dossier 2Steal 2016 American Election STOP!
Why?
That's how the war industry survives
Humanitarian concern? How about Chechnyan concentration camps?
Flush Syria down the toilet.
Maybe we should be taking in refugees. Oh, that's right, they're not white christians so the GOP wants them kept out.
maybe you can take in a family and support them.
I would. Gladly. And once on their feet, studies show the refugees we help have positive impacts on our economy.
@PartiesUnited @SenJohnMcCain spent years being tortured in Viet Cong prison camp. Trump had 5 deferments - a coward.
I have never been tortured and cannot judge others. I was a teenager during the war but never served.
I posted link McCain met w/Syrian rebels fighting against ISIS. @FoxNews @BreitbartNews aren't accurate.
I was a reporter and editor for @AP. What do you read?
How about if US stop arming terrorist and allow for political solution by having Syrians chose what they think is best for their country?
Not my problem. My tax dollars should be used inside the borders of the United States, not fighting someone else's war.
Would you rather they come here to fight us? You do know how that works, right? There are countries out there that want us GONE!
I think you are the savior of our fragile democracy right now. Thank you for your leadership, Senator McCain.
no @SenJohnMcCain is not, it was the million of voters that rejected the enSLAVement of Globalism and Bush's New World Order
@loudobbs Insane McCain, perhaps you shouldn't support sanctions against Syria & they could fight the enemy better. #DOBBS
Great job, Senator. By that I mean, you did bad. Stop making wars. Stop trying to cause a war with Russia.
And he has the audacity to post this as if he didn't directly vote for these things, indeed, is trying 4 more!
Die a miserable death. Fast!!
Don't pay attention to RINOs.
watched Cries From Syria on HBO. Syrian ppl slaughtered by Assad & Russia-targeting schools & hospitals. What can US do?
We can stop arming the "rebels" who are more sectarian than Assad, and attack our true allies the SDF.
IMO the civil war is lost cause. The FSA has lost. Whatever US has been doing for FSA or SDF, it failed.
Wasting resources. Rojava/SDF will actually come out stronger than before. FSA imaginary moderates will lose.
Please stand up to Trump.  You have to be our TBD.  Help America help Syria help our  World.
Trump is helping Syria. He cut off CIA military aid to al Qaeda (aka modertes rebels).
No troll zone. Constructive suggestions only.
Canadian Conservatives still Screaming "Murder All of Them !"
Get off the damn fence if you want any credibility.
4-7-2017  post Trump's Syria bombing without congressional approval.  McCain is better than Trump any day!  He is a war hero!
remember the #SyrianSpring?
6 yrs into Syrian civil war: 400K dead, 1/2 pop. forced to flee, 9.3M ppl desperate for aid - strategy needed now more than ever #SaveSyria 
plenty of blood on your hands. Aiding, abetting, arming & funding known terrorists. @realDonaldTrump hang him for treason
Are you admitting guilt or gloating about your accomplishments?
I appreciate what you are doing to keep dictator from destroying our countryI voted for you&will again if #mccainforpresident
We could maybe keep vetting them and letting them in, send Trump to Syria, instead. Just a suggestion.
@BeckyLouOutdoor sorry but I rather save our veterans. Homeless . That pp in Syria
do you have nightmares at night for what you did...arming ISIS ...was the 30 pieces of silver worth it...you are a traitor.
yeah let's wait a decade ...at least you can blame trump now
How many AMERICANS,  American Citizens NEED HELP? AMERICANS FIRST, MUCH WORK TO BE DONE HERE FIRST!!!!
So @realDonaldTrump sides with Russia to help Assad & Putin to inflict more death, then  block all refugees to US. Great. @SenJohnMcCain
and he plans to cut foreign aid programs. IYO why arent we doing more to protect civilians caught in the war? @senjohnmccain
Because fraud @realDonaldTrump is in this to enrich himself at the expense of the entire human race. @nomadicvision1 @SenJohnMcCain
IMO humanity should be whats emphasized. Personal agenda get in the way of saving human lives @senjohnmccain If our gov 1/2
YOU Obama, Hillary, are the creators of this disaster in Syria. You should be tried for treason with those two rats. #YEYEEGF
Thanks to yours and Obama support for terrorist, this war goes forever !!!
Please get Congress to send large aid pkg food, water & things to help the millions starving & send Red Cross, medical aid
USA has created refugee crisis and chaos by our interference in Syria and Libya Our actions violate Int'l Law + UN Charter
If only Syria & the world at large could be saved from bloody warmongers like you, @SenJohnMcCain, & that other sore loser Lindsey Graham
Why don't you run this by your buddies at Hezbollah. Didn't they have any ideas 3 weeks ago when you met with them?
You, Obaman et. al, caused this war by supporting terrorists. I support #Assad and the Syrian people.
face of the earth
You are a terrorist supporter. This was your handy work along with Obama and Clinton. You yourself need to perish from the

Go ask your liberal butt buddy Lindsay to help you. What do you 2 do all day anyway?

Save the U S first! We have decades of issues that have never been addressed.
Thanks Mr. Obvious.  Now what are you going to do to make a positive difference? Talk is cheap.
Nice job McCain. How many hundreds of thousands more have to die......until you get your Oil Pipeline route secured????
Trump's solution to the oppressed refugees? Deny them basic human rights.
a complete pull out. All this shit was for oil-gas lines in golan heights and energy away from russia to eu
@charjoe2000 and what have u done the last 6 years....we the people need less talk and more action
this is why we need term limits
A problem you and your fellow Nation Building NeoCon Politicians helped create
well, what have YOU done or said last 6 years to help. Pres. Trump just got there.
.@SenJohnMcCain This is what happens when you have a #RogueGovernment that creates and enables terrorists by arming them. #Traitor
Save Syria by funding Al-Qaeda to take over their country under the name of ISIS with our tax dollar What hypocrisy
start by not supplying weapons! The weapons provided are part of the "slaughter"
I think you're working for Russia
No thanks to you!  Blood of many Christians, Yazidis, Awalites and moderate Muslims are on your hands!
dude, it's US started civil war there, what else do u wanna do to this country?
you're the only republican with a brain. Don't let them bully u!! Stand for what u believe in even when they throw rocks Sen
I'm more concerned with saving OUR TROOOS lives!
You evil spawns did this! Why the hell would we rely on you to fix this problem? #StPatricksDay #MAGA #draintheswamp

RINO
McCain and co. instigated the Syrian war in the 1st place...
U have been photographed consorting w/ ISIS terrorists...
you have been largely responsible for the disastrous foreign policy that lead to their war. Strategy is needed, but not yours
you and George Soros need to stop arming terrorists!
why don't some of the Syrian men stay and fight for their land?
the middle eastern countries should save syria not the US.
#McCain is one of the Founders & Funders of #ISIS which was used to topple #Christian friendly #Syria!
syrian war started when USA armed moderate rebels in this country.
You cannot be serious. You probably voted for Hillary considering your lack of concern for legal American citizen vs refugee
how about saving our country first deeply in debt and millions of poor people
& n part your fault for supporting your #globalist bros #Obama & #Soros. Stop your war mongering. Support @potus. #maga
I Blane you for Syrian deaths. We had no reason to send our military to Syria. We are still fighting Afghan. StandfotTruth

Why you met with ISIS? Provided ISIS+Al Nusra with $million of weapons-to "save Syria"? Google: ISIS Photo With John McCain'

Syria situation is dire w/suffering. How about a strategic peace plan? We can't afford war. #hardchoices #ceasefire
Are we pretending that it isn't all of your making, @SenJohnMcCain?Has there ever been a war you didn't like, for everyone's kids but yours?
If you were President what exactly would you do with the Syrian mess.
disgraceful old fool.
You are so right. We will all be judged for not doing more. #RussiasTrumpCard
Clinton Foundation   sb sending aide since Hillary & Obama started this over gas reserves.
 WOW, plenty of feedback here Senator... Well, a little more; we don't need to clean up YOUR mess over there. Fuck Syria & U
Why did you arm the extremists? How much were you paid by your masters Mr. Lobbier?
Yes, ther strategy is they return to their country and fight for it!
how come there wasn't this concern when Obama was President & after 1, 2, 3 years? Hmmm oil
Didn't you and Lindsay go over to Syria and arm ppl that ended up being IS sympathizers and committed atrocities?
Sen, can you explain why upwards of a million people left East Aleppo for West Aleppo? I guess they did not want to die.
You’ve done a fine job as an ISIS General. Time for you to move into the old folk’s home.
all 6 years you've been a senator. You've done ZIP! So shut the fuck up!
Where are the refugees supposed to go? With what aid money are we helping them under the @GOP budget? #Budget2017
should be investigated
Russia did it Russia did it
you and Hillary destabilized and know acting like a hero ur cookoo
we need term limits for traitors like you funding radical Islamic terrorism to support your agenda
