#IStandWithRand
Please don't forget us widows of the fallen, SSIA $310 . We are having a rough time, if this stops, more poverty for us..
While you're at it do us a favor and resign
Who the hell wants to listen to you? You speak out of both sides of your mouth. #RINO #Songbird #Traitor
How bout a 10k a year raise?
The Military will only be used to oppress US in a Socialist State. Repeal Obamacare or defund our Military. They will be the people's enemy.
And don't forget the body bags...
Shut up and go home. You aren't needed in DC.
No one wants to listen to you
Get them out a there that's what they need. Traitor McCain
Hope you stay awake, can't take another incoherent session of your babbling. RETIRE Brutus
We sent you there to do tax reform
Go home John, you're drunk...permanently
We will do everything for our troops but what about the rest of us .
All you want is WAR!!! Why McCain! Retire already!
I hope the words u use r "I resign".
I appreciate your service and what you have done for the country, but I think you have let bitterness get in the way of progress. Godspeed!
Ok OneVoteMcCain....
Repeal the AUMFs and create new ones if you can figure out what the mission is.
Please don't speak. Just shut up and stay home. That would be best for REAL Americans.
Working on the Tax Reform Mr Senator? The American people and small businesses are expecting for you to vote "YES".
Good luck on that one. He is in Soros pocket
Please retire you make me sick
"Oy"  (to McCain speaking). No negative intention towards veterans
Sen McCain - pls support Medicare 4 All - that is the right thing 4 our nation. Not everyone today is as lucky as u r 2 get care from Mayo!
With you Senator McCain. God Bless your strength and love of our country!  Thank you!
In contentious times .... absolutely Senator....its a smart move.
Nobody cares about what you have to say lying traitor. Can't wait for the President makes you use Obamacare
The sad thing is what u say and what u do is not to be trusted. You need to retire. U have fooled Americans too many times.
There is a much greater threat to our nation, John. We both know which trump it is. And its stealing priority from our armed-forces
I admire your service and sacrifice. You are a hero. Your vote on OC was a betrayal of your party, colleagues, and those who voted for you.
Support Sen Rands bill.
Please don't
Resources? As in coming home out of foreign shitholes? I agree.
Yawn.... Retire; because you do not represent the people, your state; only your own personal leftist Agenda.
He's dying and trying to atone
DEAR SIR, LETS GET OUR TROOPS HOME ALREADY.THEY CAN HELP BUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY CAN HELP BUILD BACK HOUSTON AND FLORIDA. NO MORE WAR
WE ARE OCCUPYING THESE COUNTRIES NOW. 16 PLUS YEARS??? AND WE STILL CAN'T GET IT RIGHT. LEAVE THEM BE. BRING TROOPS HOME TO JOBS.
Really! Enough of our young men have died !
John McCain: loves the troops- always wants to send them in harms way.  Honorable man- always wants to kill people.  Please retire
Are you going to screw over our military as well? Please fade away or declare the truth, you're a democrat disguised as a republican.
Let's vote against everything you favor to show you how it feels
Don't ban LGBT sir.
You've been in the senate for how many years? And troops still don't have all they need? I respect your military service but time 4 u to go
LET THE TROOPS GOVERN THE WARZONES
NOT DONALD THE COWARD TRUMP! 
KEEP THE FUNDS FOR TROOPS OUT OF HIS PERSONAL POCKETS. IS MILITARY DEFENSE
Let's get hurricane survivors the resources they need!
John never misses a chance to be a boon to his military contractor donor$.
GFY.
The force be with you John.
Why didn't you stand up to Obama when he took away from the troops. No balls? You caused this with Obama.
Please don't !
Mr. McCain sir, how do you feel about bernie's chances about his soon-to-debut healthcare plan?
Looking forward to hearing what you have to say!
Where's all this money coming from John? Tax cuts?
BIG Tax cuts to billionaires? 
Or me?
Or from healthcare?
