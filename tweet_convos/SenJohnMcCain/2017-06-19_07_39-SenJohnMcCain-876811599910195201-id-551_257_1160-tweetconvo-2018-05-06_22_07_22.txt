You are all talk and no action! Why was the 22 year old killed over there alone w/no US soldiers around him? Why is his body still held up?
@POTUS was VERY clear on this subject, he wants us out of all foreign issues..protectionist agenda...get over it or pick a side already!
I wonder how much you could have gotten done in 6 months Senator McCain? Oh that's right you were not elected!
HA! can you imagine this man running the country? Now that's scary.
of course not, they are only concerned about messing over Americans on healthcare to get a tax cut for themselves.
And how many years YOU have been in office and not completed ONE thing we Arizonians need and want. #securetheboarder
Why do ya'll keep voting him into office over and over.
I have been voting against @SenJohnMcCain for years now....guy is a clown
in France youth says ancient politicians who resolve nothing but war, chaos hate etc. must stay at home let youth be peacefull creative
Our leaders are the worst. Really bad hombres with bad plans and no ideas!
you are useful for nothing but hate death devil with all militia & plan like EIIL al qaeda etc. you must be judged by IPT you're #criminal
Senile "Songbird McCain" is always willing to flap his lips, yet offers no assistance or credible ideas. U are in the swamp we are draining.
you write your foundation isn't for private project it's the opposite, private project for world war with drug rapes etc. #CIA #NATO #GLADIO
Message paid for by George Soros
Success doesn't come when it is not defined. Old fools may masturbate.
Blah blah blah That is what we hear from u once upon a time u had a pair grow them back 1 Sen Standing up will be a great man in history
He lost those in Vietnam. Song like a canary.
Old John would have us Marching In to Madness already ?
Our military is a special resource that we do not wish to jeopardizeâ˜†
Chaos Trump is too busy obsessing with his grandiosity on Twitter to care. Congress better do it.
We still don't have a lot except slice and dice the people land, health, security oh too many to list! DO SOMETHING
We owe it to Americans not to take away their health care in private
@POTUS strategy on everything seems to be to simply undo anything that @BarackObama did, payback for WHC dinner.  Revenge is not a strategy.
Hell. We have a half assed government right now. Only worried about taking away healthcare, military childcare, meals on wheels, etc.......
taking away these things are directed at the non-citizens. Are you a citizen or just too young to actually understand
If the President came up with a plan you wouldn't support it. Hey, why don't you come up with one?
The Pres could go 100% with McCain and McCain would scream foul just as he and Dem do now.
And you owe it to our President to show him respect by implementing his vision w/o whining! Get w the program!
Thank you for supporting my vision if an America without healthcare or integrity!
Why are you more critical of Trump than you were of Obama on this point?  Getting paid by Soros?
Senator McCain the POTUS is bat-shit crazy. He has no plan other than filling his pockets with the people's money. #ImpeachTrump
Oh yeah that $1.00 pay check he gets is really filling his pockets. Turning his business over to the kids is really filling his pockets.
did not hear you complaining and whining the last 8 years when there was no plan except remove troops and you allowed it to happen
If U would stop running UR mouth like a democrat & actually do UR job to help the Admin it might we might be able to move forward.
So let's spend billions "protecting" US citizens but we don't care about US citizens healthcare, right good plan.Cancer is bigger terrorist.
And what kind of the strategy did the last administration leave us to work with ????
Ummm. It's time u came OUT of closet
the least of your problems - you're about to strip millions of gop voters of healthcare. how about taking a stand for your supporters?
Seems that Ocare has already done that my friend
Thank you for stating the obvious..apparently necessary
Coalition govt to counter Taliban future u. s.  bases, standing army, strategic alliance, economic ties
Or healthcare or taxes or education so why do u keep approving people who do nothing and hate listening. Stand up already
John where have you been?????
Spoken like a true Democrat!!!!
Oh no it's a really big great secret plan that ppl will really love it's big and great big. He'll tell everyone right after he shows taxes
You are as responsible as Dems for this & now it appears you're bragging.
Drudge report this morning says MCCain Institute is funding by George Soros. Is this true???
It's not easy ... history is a tough judge
It's time for u and other repubs to stop backing this madman . Impeach him and let's get back to being a great respected country .
It has always been a heist of the American ppls resources.What r u talking about?
I'm sure Sec Mattis is advising the president properly. You've been a senator since day 1 in this war. You distaste for our CINC is apparent
Secret mean Trumpcare. Withstood torture, but lost your soul on this.So sad. I respected you.
Can tRump make money off a strategy for #Afghanistan? Well there you go, that's ur answer, besides he's too busy looking for illegal votes
Or anything really...
All talk McCain. We see right thru you. Your wife is on the trump administration which means no action on your part.
Who got your vote for POTUS?
. John please retire i think u took to wacks to the head at the Hanoi Hilton.  U did what u could just retire its ok god bless
It's not just Afghanistan.
Strategy was 30 days .... how is that going again ??
Sad when frustrated soldiers like my husband spent yrs sacrificing/trying 2 make Obama's disastrous exit plan work. How 2 clean up his mess?
How long have you been there? 0 accomplishments and you're losing your mind. Russia should be our Partner and not our foe.
You're just an old look now John, retire.
whatever it is, no question you will do what you can to stymie Trump.
Still waiting on the secret plan that will end ISIS and the wall and great healthcare at fraction of cost and new NAFTA deal and his taxes.
@StevenMWolfe3 please please just shut up there is a plan you just forgot.
Do something!  Quit stonewalling our President!
Nor one for Syria, or replacing Obamacare, or to build his wall, or to create 10M jobs in 4 years, etc. #LordyIHopeThereAreTapesToo!
Please DO NOT fore sake Americans by approving a healthcare bill that is WRONG.
Fair enough. We'd also like to know what's in the health care bill. Affects more people than Afghanistan.
Ask Mattis.
Look who learned to speak again! I guess the only time you can't is when you're questioning Comey on his Russia connections. #McCainPutin
Owe it to the troops to come up with a plan . umn are u ok the plan is 5000 more go in and kill as many slimeballs as possible
Let's work on America first
6 months in and there's no strategy for anything. Not. A. Single. Solitary. Thing. Governing by reactionary tweet and secret legislation.
If you all including democrats would leave him alone he might be able to do his job!!!
Maybe they do have a strategy but do not feel the need to share with the American ppl.
Here's a strategy.  Get Donny to quit.
To old John go home before we have another USS Forrestal
John McCain is useless. He spends all his time turning on the VOTERS and goes on liberal @CNN @MSNBC spewing against @POTUS
What have you done John but obstruct and hinder this Administration?
Dump Trump
and yet you will still go sucking up to Trump and his cohorts
All elected leaders need to work together.  How can we bring the world together if we can work with one another here
Get all your buddies. Off there high horse and go to work !
Get out now.
From the Do Nothing senator
You been in Senate years.  Get off your ass and do something for America.  No more free rides Sir!
Instead of going on ur bash @realDonaldTrump tour U could have stayed in US & helped get thing done. Complaints are easier than solutions
Excuse me, Senator, how have you helped @POTUS the past 6 months?  You haven't!  U owe it 2 our troops to deliver support not talking crap
You've been on the Armed Servs. Committee for years and have done nothing for our vets or our shoulders. So shut the F up! Please retire!
The WH is shutting out the free press. I think we have issues on many fronts.
Shut your lips traitor!
6 mos in & we still don't have a plan for ANYTHING.  Get busy.  Work w prez.  Tax & healthcare reform. Debt reduction. Jobs. Infrastructure.
GOP doesn't appear to have a strategy for anything except destruction of health care
Over 30 yrs in office, still no plan to fix the VA for Vets
Amendment 25 of the US Constitution a POTUS can be removed from office temporarily or pernamently if he/she is mentally or physically unfit.
there hasn't been a strategy from the previous administrations either so you only have yourself to blame
Listen to McCain! Trump knows nothing about foreign policy. APPRENTICE PRESIDENT!
You are in the position of Senator to lead, not just complain!!  Please be the leader we voted for...
"I have observed [presidential candidates] who take the loss and become angry, bitter, look around for somebody to blame for the failures"
Please retire

Agrer 100%.
@POTUS is doing remarkable things despite fact pole like you harass and wont get behind him! Obama did nothing but damage for 8 years!
@SenJohnMcCain  30 years in the senate, you owe it to all to get out !
How many yrs. have u been in Senate?!we have been in Afghanistan ; 16 yrs. u want to blame Trump. Why don't u come up with a plan & present.
Where were you the last 12 years? Support DONALD Trump and Pence wholeheartedly and quit whining.
Support TRUMP OR ELSE LOSE 2018 Congress Senate
if all US military spending was used for humanity probably a cancer cure already would have been found, Mars colonised by now
more criticism from you John McCain?  Why don't u do something other than whine about it?  Time to retire?
Then why don't you show some leadership and help instead of trashing him?? Senator McCain, we're tired of the bureaucracy! Help our Pres!
Impeach! Incompentent, an embarrassment regardless of party.
Plus WH Foreign policy continues to fail. WH outmaneuvered by China who is negotiating creation of military base in Pakistan. We are losing
the stategy was to pull troops outi thought. But your massive military has to keep being involved to justify cost.
Talk, talk, talk. How about some action Mr. McCain?
"Only I can fix" Thanks a lot @realDonaldTrump
Who voted these bozos into office.  Oh Americans.
Last time i checked we send 5000 troops. Sounds good to me. The only way to change is stay in there like Germany after WW2.
You owe it to us to stand up against fascism, hypocrite.
Why now? There wasn't one in the last 8 years.
So do you have one John, how about working with POTUS instead of criticizing or just retire, you think things were better under Obama
Well it's hard for @realDonaldTrump to do everything when the rhinos are not supporting him #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Bring the troops home heck with others countries
No press allowed in press conferences. Not normal. Not ok
That's not the only thing missing.......
I've lost respect for my country, just so disgusted. It's ok to lie, cheat & steal
Oh dirty old man, go to your bed
They're too busy trying to put out your fires. Try being helpful.
We also do not have a fair, open process for crafting a healthcare bill! #Get out of Afg.  #ShowUsTheBill  #HealthcareforAll
you guys are in charge...why not??
I like ur words, but they mean nothing when u don't follow up w/ action. Especially when u turn around and vote for people like Betsy Devos.
The senate needs to get off its ass and replace healthcare and tax cuts. Leave the presidents job to the president .
A strategy seems to be missing on everything
quit siding with the Dem-wits and their stupid distractions and help a guy out.
Because you guys are not standing up against Dems with all their destructions !! Support @POTUS!!
So if you help president by uniting party maybe more can be done.  You disappoint in your lack of support
John? You're kidding right? This guy ain't getting nothing done, because he spends too much damn time looking in the mirror. #Trumpisanidiot
IMPEACH trump for Gods sake. He has done so much damage already and you do nothing!!!
We don't have a plan for anything except arguing about crowd size.
What have we accomplished in Afghan?  16 years of war, thousands of dead Americans, billions of dollars wasted ?  We need to get out.
You all just decided to send 4000 more. Do your job and pay attention or retire.
Amen senator, if we don't have a plan then we plan to fail.
Your PRESIDENT is a liar
Your no help to the president John
Does Nancy Polisi smell like pee to you too?
Time to RETIRE!
6 months into new admin & have nothing at all of substance from the @POTUS. When will the GOP put our country ahead of their party?
You are a sell out McCain
Stop the hate, support your president and his agenda or retire.
6 months 2 long, and no plan 4 anything as it pertains 2 foreign policy. There is a secret, Gop-only rich tax break, I mean healthcare bill
That would be refreshing.
Shut up Liberal @SenJohnMcCain .
Didn't Wonder Boy say he knew how to end it, mimicing a certain senator who made similar claims in 2008?
u cannot win in Afghanistan, all you want to do is sacrifice more American blood and Treasure Resign
Where is you strategy for Obama care?
But you keep saying you support the President.  Your actions are enabling the destruction of 100 years of American leadership
Sec. Mattis just said Tuesday he was crafting a strategy to be available mid July. Are you having another senior moment?
We deserve better than this stupid administration!!CORRUPT GOP TRAITORS!!
Please retire for the good of the country
Senator McCain are you crazy or you just getting alzheimers? Obama 8 years with no strategy Trump's generals say they'll have one by July
Aren't you tired of constantly bashing this administration? We the people sure are tired of you! Retire! @SenJohnMcCain
But hey, he gave your wifey a job. We know she needs the $$.
Have you proposed a strategy to your Commander in Chief? Or anyone for that matter? Thought all you cared about is Russia...
