What a nice and honorable man. Hopefully he will continue serving this country for many more years. We need more politicians like him.
Are you kidding ?    He must go now.  He is senile and bitter only wanting to disrupt Pres Trump
Senator McCain left it much much better than he found it - and America is and will always be better, as a result of his integrity.
Educate yourself he is a traitor Google his Tokyo rose broadcast. He's hanging onto congress in his dying days to get even with Pres Trump
Good man-honor/duty & country. Bigger fan after seeing @SenJohnMcCain humanity. More @SenateGOP should put country above party/donors @cnni
Google his Tokyo rose broadcast.  He's a phony and hanging onto congress in his dying days to get even with Pres Trump
Senator McCain, you're a true stand up guy and American. Praying for you sir. Much love and respect!

Great USNA tee shirt from the Mid Store. Time for you to MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE and vote yes on Sen Graham's bill!! #USNA74
You are ot serving my family by keeping obamacare. You are breaking my back, I work and my son is uninsured.  Glad you have great healthcare
John McCain is no war hero.

Republicans display #TakeAKneeHipocrisy. Draftdodger Trump slams @SenJohnMcCain for being a POW, yet those "bad feet" didn't hurt his swing. 
American Hero!
No thanks I think will be taking a knee

A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
@SenJohnMcCain, thank you for all you've done & are still doing to serve our country. You're a true hero. May God be with you & your family.

A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
Senator McCain, you were, are, and always will be an American Hero.
...I don't always agree with your positions on policy, but you are a good man.
if you have to ask people to do that, some thing is wrong or it would take place on own merit - good morning
You side w/NFL players your getting repaid by the Left.Communist West Point Grad Called Mattis An ‘Evil, Vile F***’ http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/27/communist-west-point-graduate-called-mattis-an-evil-vile-f/?utm_source=site …-
They will.
And serve he has. Want him to know he is a True American hero and I sincerely thank him.
You can win the fight again!
Your honor and respect transcends party lines, Senator.  This is from a liberal page (look at the comments): https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155028810111275&id=177486166274 …
Well Johnny, your fellow USNA alums are embarrassed by what you have become of late. Nobody in Bancroft Hall will be bragging about you.
I give you an example of Angela Merkel with Russia.
how about he tell sports players to STAND UP?
How about The 1st Ammendment? Freedom of speech and EXPRESSION!?
How about if they take a knee to honor you.   Seems to be the fashionable thing to do in the nfl.
Yes, sir, Senator McCain. You have, and are still serving our country with great honor, dignity, and direction for those who will follow you
Traitor
I am humbled by your integrity& how you hv stood truth to power. Your choices hv brought growth to each of us, as well as shaping who U R.
I want to know how much money you received for this interview! And WHY U CALL URSELF A REPUBLICAN!
Can't understand wacko comments about McCain being a POW  hero . They probably r from Russia Iran or belong there
I love John McCain. He's a hero to all. Even a Canadian Liberal like me
Google his Tokyo rose broadcast.  He's a phony and hanging onto congress in his dying days to get even with Pres Trump
OMG. You have to be kidding
Very good interview. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your service. We need more like you to bring our country together!
I may not agree with your politics on many things, but one thing is clear, you have served this country to the best of your ability.
Thank you for not having us all die because of #Trumpcare
Weight in on NFL and don't be spineless
Great episode — at least he isn’t a wussy Senator incapable of independent thought. Most Senators could just email their vote.
He is a traitor just educate yourself and read his history   He's also a phony and of course he voted he's anti-President Trump
@SenJohnMcCain 1515 Mccain has failed our country. Hia behavior is appalling
How is his behavior appalling?  Was it when he was a POW & wouldn't leave the other men?
Mcain is a coward and a liar. He betrayed the people. Never to repeal
Ya think? Could or would u have gone thru what he did at Hanoi Hilton & then not leave without  others? He didn’t betray he stoped 
Sham
Senator McCain, you will always be a true American hero!!  Thank you for setting an example for the rest of us to put America first!
trump will never be able to say that.  He has done nothing but take and destroy.  His legacy is already written and it is a bad read.
Google his Tokyo rose broadcast.  He's a phony and traitor
I did not prosper because they did not guarantee self- defense.
Senator McCain, You have ALWAYS served ALL Americans. Absolute respect for all you have done. Thank you, Sir! #Dems4McCain #McCainRocks
Not anymore. I used to believe.
And let down and robbed from the pockets of voters who employed and trusted him! Obama Care has robbed more family income than any program!
My son is now a 2C at USNA. At parents weekend, They had a presentation with you as one of their alums. You do us proud- and I am a dem
Instead they will say: "That guy, he betrayed our country"!
Except they already said that he's a filthy traitor who sold out Americans to save his own ass.
Would've gotten the death penalty if Nixon hadn't pardoned him.
Standing and saying 'This guy serves humanity and future generations to come.'
I'm sorry to hear of your prognosis. You've done a lot for your country and I shamelessly ask 1 more thing. Stop Trump. a scared American
U think the N Academy doesn't hate you at this point? Covering up the deaths of all those sailors and pinning it on THEM is an abomination!
Or take a knee.
I came for Oprah & was pleasantly surprised by McCain... What an inspiring man. His attitude of gratitude is a testament to his strength.
Instead they'll say, "this is the guy who let his hatred of Trump get in the way of a reasonable replacement of Obamacare". U serve only U.
His CHEMO brain meant to say This guy really knew how to screw his country
Hero.
Total timed PR piece interview to combat your poor approval ratings over resistance of healthcare.! Shame on you John!
If we could only get the NFL to stand and keep their political opinions out of our sports.
He's almost 80 years old, he should've outgrown petty childish BS almost 60 years ago. Obviously hasn't.
Seriously #SongBird!

Senator, i pray for your cancer to be healed, but when your time on earth is over, i know your  is truly Red, White & Blue.
NO!! #Traitor #Songbird and now #Karma is full force on you! You're getting exactly what you deserve!! #MAGA #LoveMyPresident 
You promised when you ran for senator that you were leading the fight to repeal and replace Obama care. You lied.

If you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen. McCain insulted 63 million people and is upset that one attacked him.
and they will, proudly.
NARCICIST! Being a POW does NOT rubber stamp all your opinions for the rest of your life!!  @SenJohnMcCain.
stand up and say" he turned his back on Americans and cast a decisive vote not to REPEAL OBAMACARE because the POTUS said he wasn't a hero 
If the US give up its traditional policy in the world,the relationship with the Russian-Chinesse alliance is served on a platter,lord.
they WILL because he DID...his big mistake was Sarah @SarahPalinUSA; he could have won the presidency; he is a man of honor
What kind of service you guys left a mess( for Pre. Trump to fix ) 20T in debt,open borders,higher taxes, depleted military,world conflicts
You are a true hero who continues to serve our country w/ impeccable honor. An outstanding role model for all, especially our youth.
How mccain became a traitor serving his country. Vietnam taught him to be a communist traitor.
Dream on.
Served his country great in the armed services, but let this country DOWN as a lying, no good Senator. #retireMcCain.
McCain is a hack paid for by Soros
Will forever be known as #JohnThumbsdownMcCain #TheWorstRepublicanEver
I want people to celebrate you NOW while you are here to enjoy it!!!
He's no hero. Google his Tokyo rose broadcast.  He's a phony and hanging onto congress in his dying days to get even with Pres Trump
Omg!! They made him record that. He got beat for not saying enough about that to the French interviewer (see PBS special) YOU endure torture
when @SenJohnMcCain dropped the live ordinance on the deck of the carrier, causing explosions & fires, he went under deck 2 watch television
@SenJohnMcCain, while in the Navy flying in Vietnam, dropped live munitions on the deck of an aircraft carrier, killing naval officers.....
@SenJohnMcCain says he wants to destroy @realDonaldTrump because @SenJohnMcCain is jealous and was never @POTUS

#Liberal #Swamp #Creature
How about if they just take a knee, John? Would that be alright? Your old buddy @BarackObama the "patriot"? Anyway, you served, thanks.
For real, John! Your the biggest joke ever. The modern day "Benedict Arnold" who has lied his way through life. Judgement day will shock you
Since all you're known in this country for is a liar, I doubt that happens.
So you are punishing Americans with high health premiums because Trump owes u an apology? Thought u were a bigger man!
A few people, he said. I think there'll be more than a few. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain. We are grateful for you. #gratitude
Also said he wants only a few people.  My guess Trump is not on the list

#MyLyrics          Please retweet 
Yes. Duty, honor and country. He promised his constituents he would vote to repeal and replace Obamacare. Lied to get reelected. Pathetic.
Thank you for all you have done!!
Wow a guy that brags about graduating 894 of 899. Retire Brutus
I continue to be amazed by your strength and humanity! I wish you the very best! Stay strong!
I would like you to know watching you on 60 minutes, makes me and others with cancer want to fight harder thank you agin!
Leaving an alot of info.out on his military history. Lets hear the whole truth. Aircraft carrier incidents.. remember?
Close - "This guy, he screwed his country."
This is truth. Even through our disagreements, no one can say @SenJohnMcCain isn't a hero and a patriot.
You failed the American.  You probably don't even use Obamacare.
@POTUS rename USS John McCain as Senator McCain has ruined his family legacy & suggest Logan Palmer, a true American hero unlike him
Being a Vietnam vet, I'll say John McCain served his Country with honor!
I would have said that, but lately he is hurting all with no access to Healthcare. To bad all the bad is all that will be remembered
Last of his class. Deadly hazardous (USS Forrestal CV-59), over 130 killed. Vindictive and hateful displayed all over his face and demeanor
#puffpiecepuffpiecepass
They will, Senator, they will 
served or screwed?
They should take the knee. How would he like that?
waiting for the story on Songbird McCain fraternizing with Vietnam was going to be court martialed until his daddy's Admiral got him off
But he could in "good conscience" give the Viet Cong In the Vietnam war sensitive information regarding US troops. Was a traiter then is now
@SenJohnMcCain lies is a traitor to his State and Party. It is not hurting @POTUS as much as it hurts ppl bc Repubs said they wld Repeal
They should say “Old Soldiers (Sailors) never die they just fade away” ..General Douglas MacArthur  for whom I have more respect.
@SenJohnMcCain They WILL say that because You HAVE!! God Bless you.
Please Father in Heaven he has served long enough.
Sounds like he wants his ass kissed. All while he screws the American citizens over.
Fat chance of that. USNA 79 and I think rather poorly of you John.
Thank you 
Daddy's Little boy
There are plenty of sailors who still remember the "song bird" pardoned by Nixon, you can't paint over shit.
Nice disrespect of a war hero, psycho.
McCain's legacy is hate and homophobia. He destroyed the lives of many gay soldiers with #DOMA and #DADT!
I salute you Sen. McCain. Duty, Honor, & Country. A true Hero!
Useful IDDIOT for press and democrats. Go away
Also sang like a traitor and damaged a ship. Some legacy.
OMFG, GOOGLE MCCAIN'S TOKYO ROSE BROADCASTS if you think he's a hero.
Ill say that for you sir! Hope not for a very long time!
Watching @FoxNews. Won't waste my time watching a #PettyOldMan who hates @POTUS more than loves America.
That can be said of EVERY person who served in the Armed Service.
Yes it should.. But not about draft dodging President's who make deals with foreign COUNTRIES! #TrumpNoHonor
Silly old fool. He doesn't realize that the only time the media talks to him is when a republican president is in office cuz he is a sellout
Have you been screaming about how kneeling disrespects the people in the military today by chance? And now you're disrespecting a war hero?
Feel sorry for me boo hoo hoo! Try ACA then let's hear you soob!

Oprah Oprah gave millions of dollars to the Obama campaign what about the Black Panthers they are racist
John McCain is a patriot and a true hero. He's an extraordinary man who serves his country well.
My dad never wanted anyone to stand for him after coming home from Vietnam.....he just wanted someone in DC...to stand up for his family
@SenJohnMcCain is our very own American Hero.  We all love him.
Not LGBTs. We hate him for all the damage he did!
Why didn't you ask about campaigning on repealing obamacare? #puffpiece
Was he talking about himself? He was a songbird committed treason & is an arrogant narcissist who needs to retire before his legqcy is GONE

He's truly an honorable man ! Thank you for your service sir ! I appreciate it & you & your fellow servicemen & women! #60Mins
Now you can retire. We need someone we can count on to be working for us.
A true American hero. How Leslie Stahl kept it together w/o breaking down is amazing.
A true American homophobic bigot!
I have a lot of respect for Senator McCain!
I have ZERO!
Great segment, tonight @60Minutes. We needed this.
