This is the USNHS Comfort. A mercy hospital ship. You need to push to send her to Puerto Rico where she is badly needed
Here she is, please, send her where she is needed
It's been deployed, but it won't get there for like 6 days
As long as it get's there, that's what matters the need is great and won't go away for a long time
I'm just afraid it will be too late for some :(
Let's hope not
It’s on its way but there are no open ports deep enough to bring her in. They have to coordinate airlifts to and from.
Actually the last time they were grilled on it they said "no one asked"
There are NO PORTS! You can bring all the ships you want, no place to receive them and would probably create a bigger mess.
Let's all believe Karen & her partisan online sources rather than McCain, gov of PR, FEMA & our own eyes!
Maybe you'll listen to the FEMA spokesperson himself: FEMA offers update on latest in Puerto Rico response efforts
Why r u the only person to not have seen or heard updates from any other source than Fox News?
Lol that update was from 5 or 6 hours ago. Same guy was on CNN but couldn't find link. Happy now?
We will be happy when the people of Puerto Rico are no longer facing imminent death. That’s kinda the point here.
No shit. 
????
Glad to see you stopped being a blind party man. Good for you
The World is watching how Puerto Rican families and soldiers have been left starved to death.
It takes 45 days with absolutely no food to die of starvation
How long is it been 5 days?
That's nice, but why did you need to announce it. The president does much of his charity unannounced. Not all men need a pat on the back for their deeds of compassion. I guess you do. You always seem to need an audience.
Great job sir.
Thank you senator. Why is trump giving Puerto Rico the back of his hand.
Do tell, what is Trump doing?
It's one more way we screw PR. Corp greed always wins over the people. And in a week it'll be on the backburner again, safe from scrutiny
Don't think you're in the clear, entire #GOP has done Russia's bidding via cabinet confirmations
The cabotage provisions contained within the #JonesAct deserve a more thoughtful and informed debate. The impact is broad and cannot be fairly evaluated as a binary issue.
Than you John McCain!
why is the impeachment taking our party so long?
There has to be grounds first. Clinton was impeached didn't go anywhere.
obstruction of justice will begin to unravel and reveal what really happened!
And what would that be?
Nonsense, the man is showboating, President Trump signed that waiver WITHOUT any input from McCain.  SHOWBOAT!!
I hope this general kicks butt. Should be AF though. C-17, C-130 pallet drops. Helos lots and lots.
You are the only Repub. with a brain!
Can you stay on topic? How can you participate in a discussion when you refuse to stay on topic? You contribute NOTHING.
Speaking of changing course...
Lies
You are truly the last true republican, the rest have sold their souls ! Thank you for your support Puerto Rico 
When are you going to change course with your obstruction to the president agenda, you need to get off the never Trump horse.
U really need to retire while ur still young.
See trump 4 what he is Cruel Dysfunctional Bum who wont Lift a finger 2 HELP DIEING Hispanic AMERICANS who dont carry a VOTE.tell the TRUTH
#POTUS plays power games wth people's lives to stroke his ego.1st "no" then "yes" on Jones Act waiver.He stll thinks he is on a reality show
Set 'me straight, senator.
Mr. Trump simply DOES NOT CARE about those Americans who don't happen to look or sound like his base.
Yes Sir!
Why is John McCain so dishonest?  He needs to stop sabotaging Trump and GOP.  Retire!!!!!!
Thank you for serving America for most of your life. We are truly grateful.
Love my Senator, God Speed!
Bless you Senator.
Please Sen McCain, do what you can. Our fellow Americans in PR are in desperate need. There is no reason for such cruelty from the Prez
What cruelty is that? Do tell!? Before you talk about cruelty, maybe research what has been done first.
Keep patting yourself on the back
Too bad it was done. Can you do anything other than complain?  Retire and do us all a favor!

It's unacceptable that Trump wasn't 1st to call for #JonesAct waiver for #PuertoRico.
John McCain. You just need to retire from politics or change your affiliation to suit your contributions. Become a liberal.
#10days
This administration is unacceptable! Thanks for being a human god speed!
Senator John McCain, A true American hero
Thank you, John McCain, for truly caring!
God, people, your hatred blinds you. Repeatedly told, ships and supplies there. Problem is distribution,destruction so severe
Guess you'll try and claim credit, but as soon as PUERTO RICO requested,  it was done
Pitiful #PuertoRico
Thank you 
that doesn't make up for making a complete hypocritiical fool of yourself when you killed repeal and replace!!
Keep up the good work senator.
Lack of Diesel, communications failure crippling relief efforts in PR. 9,500 containers of critical supplies STUCK at PORT. SEND IN MILITARY
No one trusts you since you Forestal'd Repeal of Obamacare. Get over losing your feeble bid for presidency.
#PRisTrumpsKatrina
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for showing what used to be called common decency when  you & I were youngsters; but it's passing rare these days.
No one trusts McCain after he Forestal'd repealing Obamacare
It has been taped/filmed/pictures/audio/visual can't deny it
Thank you once again for being the one who cares and actually does something @SenJohnMcCain
Nothing should matter more than the lives of human beings. Nothing.

McCain you are a Stinker !!!!!!
Would like to know if Elaine Chao's family's shipping businesses have/had anything to do with Pres T's ridiculous delay on this.
But, of course you did.  Ho-Hum.
President Trump has this handled.
So @POTUS waived the #JonesAct ...
thank you for doing the RIGHT thing.....
also unacceptable for Gorsuch to give a speech at Trump's hotel. This admin is disgusting.
You are wrong sir President Trump is working hard helping PR why do you hate our President enough to lie about him. He wants the best for us
Thank you, Senator, for helping #PuertoRico. Our fellow Americans in PR and the USVI need life-saving support asap.
Unacceptable that a brain damaged senator is allowed to make major decisions for the country
More lies Cmon John stop with the propaganda and get out of the way of congress. Your career is ravaged w/poison
Like your unacceptable vote denying Americans from ending obama care! You Care only of yourself!
you were quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
John Mc Cain putting people first.
You do too many unacceptable things.
Omg,u ppl on here just spread propaganda. Ships have been sent, waiver given, etc...smh
That's a lie. They were given the waiver.
Thank you, Senator. Blessings to you.
Please retire and get better
good you brought attention to it..
The Jones Act is just an excuse!PR's r non-voting brown people.DT is a white supremacist.He keeps telling us when will we accept his truth?
Ok, so who really cares what this traitor says? Try Obamacare
My open letter to the McCain family. 
@MeghanMcCain - I sincerely hope you see this.
My open letter to the McCain family.
Sorry for typos. It's very late. Too important to wait. 
Your late, it was done.
It's very sad.  Our Prez can tweet all day and do Nothing for PR.
McCain the biggest Idiot.
TRAITOR TO AMERICANS ON HEALTH CARE & MANY OTHERS.  Your true colors have come through shameful ! Whinner loser  since  President Trump won!
Thank you
It's unacceptable that I'm getting screwed on ACA but you don't care!
Any Trump or key special-interest shipping outfits  benefiting from the Jones Act in this disaster?
Thank you for your service! The idiot draft dodger is useless and dangerous to mankind. Needs to be disappeared from the U.S. somehow, ASAP.
@FLOTUS Tell your husband to have a heart. Puerto Ricans deserve the same help as folks from TX and FL!!!
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain Please don't allow Congress to forget about Americans in Puerto Rico & USVI. People will DIE soon.
I'm a U.S. Customs Broker (lic 27766), historically the problems of P.R. is the P.R. goverment itself, not the jones act!!
Here are the facts:
American Maritime Industry Fights Back Against False Claims Regarding Jones Act and Relief Efforts in Puerto Rico http://gcaptain.com/american-maritime-industry-fights-back-false-claims-regarding-jones-act-relief-efforts-puerto-rico/ …
@SenJohnMcCain please contact CBP team called "JADE", their office is in Louisiana and they will explain so you can save some stress!
Senator, why is this happening? Who are the "shipping people" who don't want it suspended? Do they even exist? This is horrible.
@realDonaldTrump Spare Puerto Rico of your insulting visit. You are a criminal for not letting international help get there. #endjonesact
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain Your work is appreciated now more than ever.
This is the McCain I would have elected president. Sadly, when you were the nominee you went too far right.
Now thats a presidential.....thank you for working for the People!
This is not the time for more of trumps BS. These are our citizens in real need of adult leadership. Trump is a festering pile of filth.
TX & FL received #jonesact waivers. Guess PR is not ACTUALLY part of America?
One way to fuel support for anti-immigrant/refugee policies is to ensure 3.4M citizens have no choice but to come to US mainland asap.
You should retire John from GOP & join the DNC or hang out with your buddy George Soros
Yes send water, food, diesel fuel, etc.. just don't send money because the leaders corrupted. Help people & pets, that island is a money pit
Please never give up! We need you!!!
lying about repealing healthcare, your petty hatred of president trump and your need to turn your back on your party is whats unacceptable
This needs to be read, digested & shared:

Dear @AFLCIO r u really opposing a temporary waiver to urgently ship food & water to bros & sis of PR ? This is huge USA catastrophe. Shame
John. I just wanted to say thank you. I've grown to admire you. You are the definition of American. 

Much love and healing energy.
I have been asking other leaders to bring more attention to this. YOU are the person to LEAD now.  We are looking to you. Please !
The USNS Comfort needs five days to travel from Norfolk to #PuertoRico. 
At the moment she is still in Norfolk.
Sir, once again, Thank You. Ideas & Ideals May differ. But right & wrong does not. This issue must be fixed! #freePRfromJonesAct
Thank you, senator. You ARE on the right side of history. Once a hero, always a hero.
Sorry Sen MCCain thank you! But you can't teach the Unteachable #45 is unteachableTrue Americans do carestay strong we will get there
This is just crazy! People are dying!
I think your brain is deteriorating.  Time to retire and enjoy your last days with your wife and family. Put ur ego in your pocket
If ya ever get fed up with those morally challenged psychos you can hang with us on the left, #JohnMcCain.
It's unacceptable you campaigned Repealing Obamacare, then stabbed your voters in the back you Coward!!!

@thorexec
#JonesAct thank you Senator , HELP !!!! For #Puerto Rico
Keep fighting! You really will be remembered as a hero!
More lies for the Traitor @SenJohnMcCain   #fakepatriot  #betrayedhiscountry #letVetsDie  #KarmaSucks
My family is probably hungry and thirsty. Puerto Rico need help! @SenJohnMcCain Thank you for trying.
Good for you sir!   Also and foremost, I'm sure heaven is smiling on your vote against the Cassidy-Lindsey HC bill. You saved countless folk
Thank you John McCain for standing uo for Puerto Rico #PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow
He bombed Syria for killing own yet @Potus is allowing millions of our own to die. Got a body tally before you impeach? #Resist #PuertoRico
Please get #PuertoRico Help
What donor you got lined up for recovery contract 
I love you, Senator McCain. You are principled and noble. I am praying for you. Thank you for helping PR.
Thank you, Senator McCain.  @DHSgov must immediately reverse this terrible decision
You probably didn't mean it thought right?
#RepealAndReplace
Mr. McCain I don't know what got into you all the sudden you are listeningtothe American people and fighting for us again.    thank you sir
you are so right
Try to keep up Senator my gosh you just knee jerk every minute of every day!
Senator McCain you need to retire & stopping standing in the way of the working-class Americans.
#RecallMcCain or #firemccain either or.
Send a letter to yourself as well encouraging retirement if you can't quit voting  like a Democrat.
Thank you
Big thanks to @SenJohnMcCain  
Lead GOP TO IMPEACH TRUMP
Thank you! I love President Obama so much, but also everyday now  I see that you would have been a good one too. God bless you.
Waiving the act does nothing to help Puerto Rico. The docks aren't able to accept the cargo.
Your party is in charge John. Your tone indicates bewilderment. The POTUS is one of your own. Why isn't he telling the DHS to move on this?
Thank You Senator.
Thanks Senator for putting Party above country in the last election.
You wouldn't have this problem under @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @BillClinton or @JoeBiden
@jacieminniepep @DHSgov People will die in Puerto Rico because there government spends more time talking about the NFL
This stuff is cool and all, but when might you take a step back and realize you're against everything the GOP stands for?
Sir, trump's gov't is composed of #bigOil & #evangelicalFRAUDS who R textbook #SOCIOPATHS.

Americans are in GRAVE PERIL & our gov't FAILED
John I didn't vote for you, but I do admire you tremendously 4 ur service, 4 admitting Obama is a US citizen but mostly 4 ur true concern!
You need to retire @SenJohnMcCain . Bitter, sick, crazy old man.
Thank you for doing that, Sir. Please don't let up. Thank you.
Could you possibly challenge trump to a dual, combat, intelligence test to incapacitate him? Please. Take him down
Hey maybe call on the GOP to impeach, thanks!
Maybe if you have voted the other way on healthcare???  Just saying!!!  #MAGA
Thank you for your service to our country. Godspeed.
Let’s try using the Baker act on @realDonaldTrump   God knows he’s out of his mind. A danger to himself and the #USA
Thank you! You are a true hero.
Thank you Senator, you continue to fight for America and Americans.
'Deplorable' was the term I was thinking.
Thank you Senator McCain for all of your work and not going along with some of your fellow Senators during these trying times
@SenJohnMcCain I don't align w/ u politically but u have my respect for standing up 2 do the right thing the last few weeks. #KeepFighting
Thank you Senator McCain, you're about the only person that cares about their American citizens. God bless you
From the bottom of our hearts, we will never be able to thank you enough for your service, continued service. 
You have been trying to kill the jones act for years. #PR is just a convenient excuse.
I feel like our own government's trying to hurt us John.. and I don't mean just hurt I mean possibly destroy America
The DHS is an out of control, irresponsible, unconstitutional fascist agency. It should never have existed. Abolish it, undo the PATRIOT ACT
They need trucks not more fuel follow fema!
It's trump. He doesn't care about anyone who isn't white.
Senator, can't you guys just repeal the damn Jones Act?
With all due respect sir, your president hates Latinos & wants to please his shipping magnate friends! #racisttrump
It's inhumane not 2do every possible 2help the Americans of PuertoRico; @realDonaldTrump outsources but refuses #jonesAct bc it's brown ppl

I’m so ready for bi-partisan situations in my country for the #PuertoRicoStrong  & other situations! 
How can we help?
Maybe because Puerto Rico doesn't give any votes fir #realDonaldTrump  ? Just wondering why the  slow response
It's unacceptable that you go against the president on every turn
Keep the hammer down @SenJohnMcCain Give em’ Hell! #JonesAct #HurricaneMaria #PuertoRico
OMG where is the humanity?
McCain is a traitor to the US and my state of AZ... he just likes to run his mouth and be showy....
the problems are the roads+ mud slides. They have the food and water there, they just cant deliver it because of the mud slides
Mr McCain..it's unacceptable @YOU denied #GrahanCassidy act. I sent you a Tweet urging you to support it. How does it feel buddy?
Dang Sen McCain,Why do you you always have to carry everyone else on your back?  So glad you do!  a MN Dem
