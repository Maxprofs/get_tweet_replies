.@GenDavidGoldfein testified today that it will take @USAirForce approximately 8 years to get to full spectrum readiness w/ stable budgets
I went thru Tucson recently and HUNDREDS of aircraft sit and rot in the sun- we spend but not wisely
Big military needs more $$$$ for imperialism.  Need to increase their shareholder wealth @SenJohnMcCain
Sounds like another @POTUS is delusional again.
It would if the pentagon would stop wasting money on BS.
While it is advisable to have a strong military..our system is corrupt, we overspend tax dollars for what we get...political pork driven
how can military be 5x larger than anyone else's and yet it need rebuilding? Help me understand
More war and destruction. Air Force has squandered money on F-35B and other black box ops. Meanwhile you will cut social services to needy?
SAVE THIS AIRMAN HE DESERVES JUSTICE! SEE YOUR INBOX!!!
We all ready @55% that goes to defense its way to much. No is inventing us, no more WAR'S. #ImpeachTrump
As Trump insults our Allies, they may kick our troops out of their countries. 3% increase may be adequate when we are forced to downsize.
GOP "starving the beast" 4decades 2save tax $ for 1% donors.If 1% taxed fairly, treasury would b full+svcs/SS/Gov funded #TaxRich #FairTax
Yes, and if they stopped wasting money on benefits to illegals and foreign aid to countries that hate us, welfare and Medicare fraud, etc.
Because they have found no proof of it for almost a year now!
PROOF?
Just a thought... maybe if we cut back on the number of wars we're in we wouldn't need to rebuild our military.
Just a thought if we also stop letting in terrorists to our country. People want to kill us we need to be prepared.
Most terrorism is homegrown here in the states. The only option would be to start kicking people out. Trump- "Hold my beer"
Retire!
Agree
The military was not deconstructed.
For a #GOP senator Mr. McCain, I like you a lot, but we already spend too much on military. Less military spending, more education and aid!
I hope your joking! Are you watching the news! ???????
Wait, you're not gone yet! Please retire rhino
Coward.
Careful there Senator, Trump may fire you.
Stop complaining and do something.
Our military has been decimated by inept morons like john McCain. His father would be so ashamed of his incompetent country destroying life!
That's right it don't. Fire McCain what an idiot. We need much more. How about 25 percent and keep it coming. We have no military. Think man
We never stopped building. Why the hell would we need to rebuild?
Russia gets better ROII with investments in Computer interference in USA, Germany, Netherlands, France, & now Qatar. More $ for IT needed.
Need more spending for military.  Cut out the fat in Obama created govt
It's time to be rid of traitor trump!
We won't have a country if that crazy person isn't removed from the presidency.
You're full of crap
More prudent projects, stricter deadlines, fewer cost overruns and harder bargains will give us more bang for our buck and more security
You wouldn't be happy with the budget no matter what. You are nothing but a Trump basher on every level. #termlimits
Stop with the trump hate and do what WE sent you to do
At what point is our taxpayer paid military going to go to war with Putin's enlisted US White House military?
There are other solutions besides war. Take your blinders off and get out of your tunnel vision.
Please do some ty hi.g Senator McCain.
Perhaps not, but did you complain this loudly when Obama made those cuts?
No it won't but better than last President quit complaining and come up with some legislation or are you really a Dimm in disguise
Meanwhile you let trump and his family bankrupt this country
We don't need to give military more money. If Trump keeps this crap  up we will all be blown to hits
How about stop pissing off other nations so need defense increases. Spend the money on healthcare, education and infrastructure #impeachGOP
You don't mention Trump much. Ashamed?
Well and good, Senator. But please address the grave danger from within: the corrupt, incompetent, and Russia-tainted White House
No proof of this!
Troll
why did you let obama deplete our military?
Good lord! How much money are you trying to get. Most tax payers are broke!
At least this guy keeps it real
That Uranium could build the shield. Aliean ship's from INDEPENDANCE Day
You and oblah blah have pansified our military. Time to rebuild.  Go away Hanoi john..
I want a super strong military but we need an outside looking in approach. We spend more on military spending than anyone, by a lot!
If you were concerned about defense, you would be defending US against collusion with a foreign power to disintegrate our democracy. #RUSSIA
Is he ever happy about anythin g??????????????????
LESS WARS = NO INCREASE

America NEEDS housing, food and health care, not war mongering. Live by war, die by war. America does NOT WANT wars
Pentagon cant account for trillions of dollars spent. Lets address that before crying poverty and giving them increased amounts.
yes and thank you
Please share with us what needs rebuilding. I don't want to spend more on equipment. We are already 5X stronger than our nearest competitor.
Sounds like the Air Force general needs to do a bake sale.
I choose butter over guns.
I don't care. You get enough money. No reason you can't be ready with the amount of money you get
John Mccain needs to be removed from office asap.   He is as bad as any Democrat and worse because he holds rep party hostage
At this stage we can assume that NO Trump promises will be fulfilled. Any promises kept will be astonishing.
Sen Mccain you have been exposed.  You have gotten rich making money from all sides with your power selling the American People out!
Rebuild? At what point did we have a larger military? At what point did we spend more on defense? Who's military are we chasing in size?
Go on CNN and say it.... oh wait! You only go on @CNN to bash President Trump. McCain is a RINO and a sore loser
You're still here? Go away. Seriously. Forever #pieceofshit #McCain

Yea, let's build the military up, and then cut $800 billion from medicaid. Makes no fu_ken sense, unless you're a deplorable
So @realDonaldTrump is lying to the whole country. What a surprise
Rebuild america and let other countries rebuild their own to green and we give back to those we harmed via the murdering gas oil companies
We don't need any increase in DoD, it is bigger than the next 10 countries defense spending combined.

Send money to education!!

#Resist
Why not just give the military all 100% of our budget FFS?  Talk about out of control spending! Welfare for military contractors #CORRUPTION
WE WIN THE BATTLES!!
WE PROTECT YOU
BY BUILDING WEAPONS WHICH 
WILL SAVE YOU FROM BEING  A SLAVE TO CHINARUSSIANKORIRAN,,NEXT
американцы,кому выгоден этот клоун,или вы правда такие тупые?
More money for contractors and defense but no money for PBS and healthcare.
REMEMBER 
USS SCORPION
ALL HANDS DOWN
1968!!
Save money by not building things like theMOAB
Or the stupid useless wall.
Hi John McCain tough day.
Do we need our military to be as large? Then again, if Trump is torpedoing all our alliances.......
The alliances where we pay for everything and they don't? Fuck the alliances until they pay up. Tired of that bs. Just like the Paris thing.
THIS MONEY COULD GO TO VETS,,MILITARY SPENDING NEEDED,
VAs,MEDICAL,,VETS  FAMILIES,,
NAVY JET SERIOUS PRESENT PROBLEMS! WAR EFFORTS!!!
Being an anti Trump liberal Cuck won't rebuild it either. 
IT IS NOT
TOO LATE TO STOP THIS FED SPENDING

PROJECTS,,,WASTE,,
Hey John, start backing POTUS or start packing your bags. I used to like you but your recent actions have changed my mind .

STOP, FREEZEsmallTOWNS WASTING, UNESCESSARY PROJECTS FROM FED MONEY NOW!! NOW!
Duh!
Maybe if Congress would get to work on clearing the decks on Healthcare and taxes we would have more funds to fund the military, Senator.
Stop blaming the Messengers and get your act together and do YOUR JOB, SENATOR.
Sir...can't this be done in secret so enemies don't hear such things ???..
covfefe #ownHim #theGOPpresident
If we have an "America First" policy, why do we need a military that is geared towards intervention?
We don't need more military we just need to stay out of the Middle East and stop stealing their OIL and Resources. Any Questions?
If 3% is not enough then to start with why did you let it get so low that it's this bad
Obama cut the military he cut everything we needed but yet he ran or bills up y'all let this happen now y'all fix it
Everything that's going on in France we don't want it here and if it starts here we need the military to help stop it
Does every GOP statement have to include Obama?
Seriously.  I think the #GOP has a little bit of jealousy over the previous @POTUS.  You remember?  The one who could speak intelligently??
YOU MEAN THE ONE WHO COULD STEAL MONEY FROM THE GOVT & NOT BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE!! INTELLIGENTLY LIE SO SMOOTHLY!! THAT HE EVEN FOOLED YOU!
Why so shouty?
Why don't we just disclose how to destroy the USA.Do we not have ANY SECRETS pertaining to our security. SHUT UP!!!!!!!
However, defunding Medicaid will hasten the death of thousands. You'll just be killing your own constituents. So, there's that.
Senator, I've asked you this question before; what is it going to take to satisfy the military's insatiable appetite for more money?
With all due respect, how many F-35s do you need? Latest possible terror attack was with a hammer on a cop.
WAKE UP GUYS!!
WASTEFUL SPENDING OF FED MONEY
ON UNNECESSARY PROJECTS, STOP-FREEZE NOW IN SMALL TOWNS!! COULD  GET YOU THIS NEEDED MONEY!ACT
Yea because we really need to spend more to keep the gravy flowing for your MIC buddies.
Yea...and having a Russian agent as our Prez is not helping either.  Impeach him already PUHLEEZE!
Where is your proof? Stop watching CNN.
Hello Putinbot!  Waiting for your orders from the Kremlin?
just to be clear- "Obama" levels were due to sequestration , not Obama. because the Rs were and are the party of No.
Shouldn't be guns vs. butter (healthcare in this case) when we are the richest nation on earth. We just need discipline & better tax policy!
And yet we hear of hundreds of billions in waste by Def. Dept.  please reconcile.
