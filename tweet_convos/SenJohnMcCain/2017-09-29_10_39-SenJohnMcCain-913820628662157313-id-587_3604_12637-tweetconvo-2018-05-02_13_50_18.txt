"If you can't treat someone with dignity and respect--then you need to get out."-Lt. Gen. Jay B. Silveria, Superintendent @AF_Academy 
Silveria is a political grandstander who doesn't belong in the USAF clearly.  Racism is based in statistical fact.  Repudiate the 1960's.
Bravo
Y g
Or, if someone kills 134 fellow military personnel on a U.S. Carrier! No room for incompetence of this degree! #Shameful
Agreed?
@FoxNews
Well sis sir! Jay Silveria for POTUS!
@robert_follett
...or in the White House.
Salute you sir
Imagine that response from POTUS at Charlottesville...leadership.
Hope your feeling better shipmate
It was a hoax
I concur with you
I am praying for you, as a good man you deserve to be in good health don't give up Mr . McCain we need your wisdom God bless you
@TheEllenShow please have this inspirational man on your show.such an impressive speech against racists.so important esp now
And the sexism need to end. Sexism is a harbinger of other problems. If they'll attack women, next it is weak men, then it is strong men.
There should be no place for racism but it is in our soil and unfortunately always will be.
I'm a NavyVet—Give back to our Country that gave to you as your Served our Nation…Reach out across Chamber & instill Impeachment of this SOB
THANK YOU DIANE!
BTW my youngest Son is currently Serving in the USAF
so is mine! he's in reserve and was looking forward to being deployed to FL, but no orders came. now he's hoping to go to PR. love my baby!
This has existed around the world for thousands of yrs, why? We R not born w-hate or discrimination minds.
He should run to become President.
Shut up half brain RINO McCain
Lt. Gen Silveria was right on the money with his statement. After 8 yrs of service in our armed forces I can't understand how any service person can be a racist.
Haha and it was a hoax
Then you need to impeach @POTUS.  If not, the racism and bigotry problem will only get worse!
LOL and it was a hoax, impeach this! 
If you truly believe that than do something about it and remove @POTUS but good on ya @AF_Academy and Lt. Gen. Silveria!
Impeach the president.  You can do it @SenJohnMcCain
You cannot impeach a President for the manner of his speech LBJ used to cuss like a sailor & used the "N" word a lot https://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=mcafee&type=B211US0D20140220&p=requirements+for+impeachment …
I want him gone because he's incompetent, in violation of the Constitution, dividing our country, is a white supremacist, wastes our $$, ..
Except prison, probably.
Least were not deluded cunts and we don't hate democracy and equality for all.
Well duh. There's no place for traitors either.
1960's has no place in our military, and military is weaker because of it.  The vast majority of soldiers remain white.
Your kind is why we elected trump
A MAN OF INTEGRITY
Problem is "dignity and respect" translate into ignoring blatant, willful dereliction of duty, failure to perform, and malingering.  Wake up senator.
Yes...thank you sir!
Wow, powerful well spoken!! #Leaders come from all places - thank you @Kaepernick7 @SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama @AF_Academy #AmericaLovesYou
OUT! STANDING! Not in my Air Force! NOT IN MY COUNTRY! Exactly what needs to be said from every mountain top to every mountainside! Oooorah!
Would be nice if Twitler said it too
Awkward!
Then how did @jeffsessions get confirmed?
You all need to move on, and here's an idea how about we all work together and make our country a better place?
There is no way anyone should move on when the #MORANGE continues 2 appoint bigots like Sessions to positions that affect millions of lives.
Thanks for responding my quality filter blocked MB's response. Mine, STOP APPOINTING INCOMPETENT RACISTS AND BIGOTS! So no I won't "move on"
I felt the same way with Obama and his Marxist appointments 
My choice for president taught constitutional law. Your choice for president couldn't teach English.
1st grade English 
We all bleed red. All are precious in His sight.
Hey lying loser @SenJohnMcCain thanks for being a traitor a second time in your life and lying about repealing Obamacare LOSER
I just love listening to this speech ...
Great words from a great  person ..
Thank you for sharing this videos.
John, Thank you for always standing up for what you believe in. I am ashamed to admit it, but you inspire me to be a #GoodPOTUS. Keep strong
No one listens to anything you say now @SenJohnMcCain so save your energy up for your cancer treatments & pray for your soul
Sen.McCain, you have lied to the people of Arizona, I can't believe your statement! The Arm Forces treat all the same! Stop lying.
It's a shame we haven't gotten a speech like this from the president.
Shut up u fraud, AZ suffers and u fill ur Pockets from chuck & Nancy. Give your pay Chk back. U don't deserve it
When we will see the same standards the military has against membership in hate groups for police forces???????? It is urgently needed!!!!
Is Trump included?
Unfortunately racism is why @POTUS & @GOP has not put the military on the ground in PR. Hispanics are throw away people to him & Republicans
THIS IS THE GREATEST AND I'M SHARING IT WITH SO MANY FRIENDS SO THEY CAN SHARE.  BRAVO TO THIS MAN!
My oldest grandson is Army.
God Bless you Sen.McCain. ALWAYS the Hero. We are praying for you daily.
Traitor!
Inappropriate for this kind of in your face abusive talk.  You have a Private discussion with ur cadets and nicely discuss topics #abuse
I agree
@SenJohnMcCain I have the outmost respect for you, sir. And I'm a Democrat.
@AF_Academy I have the outmost respect for you. Thank you!
Then how about telling that to the president??????
Sending many blessings your way Mr. McCain and thank you for your integrity
@SenJohnMcCain - Now what about your peacekeeping army called #ISIS? Still getting #DeepState narco trillions to fund your illegal wars?
This is so E.Z for me and should be for all 2 say.  There's no place for racism or bigotry in our military and this great nation. I Agree.
Too bad @SenMcCain doesn't show how he stands for his State, his Party and truly his beliefs. #Fiction
No place in our military and great nation but definitely a place in our White House right?!?!
Agree John, please impeach lazy racist bum Pres.
Two great men!
You're right, Songbird!  Iran must be held accountable for US military racism.

You're a GEM!
What about in the @WhiteHouse? Is there room for racism AND bigotry in the People's House? Cause it's there. If not YOU need to #Impeach
Powerful statement!
Wow!  That's a powerful!  This is the kind of man that should be leading the country. He shouldn't have to make this statement, but thank u!
I wish the leader take notes with pen and paper because he is failing seriously.
Where are you in regards to the disaster in Puerto Rico? We have not heard from any Repub except Rubio
Dang right!
Amen
What does it say about our country when we have to turn to our generals for lessons on civility & social guidance?  Thank you Gen Silveria.
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for supporting the USAFA commander's statements & please accept my sincere respect & admiration for all you do!

Cobb County police Lt. Greg Abbott: "we only shoot black people"! It is official indeed! https://plus.google.com/107835312295887565713/posts/8mtjmHu9xPA … & https://plus.google.com/107835312295887565713/posts/75EqHmRwfHu …
Finally...........something you agree upon.
If thats true then PLEASE help the citizens of Puerto Rico who have been abandoned by President Trump for racists reasons. Act Now!
...and yet, here we are
Where's Trumps outrage for this disrespect?  He has so much to say about the NFL and respect for those that serve. He's the fuel to this 
Do you think POTUS will understand??
I thank God for people like you! You sir are an inspiration! Praying for you and your family.
None Sir, agreed

Can someone pass lt. Gen msg to trump !!
You need to retire John.
Nail on the head!
Impeach POTUS, Senator. Everything he's done since he started shows he's all about racism, bigotry. Stand up for the US. The time is NOW.
Senator it's time for Congress to restore integrity in the WH. Talk to your friends in the House. Time to act is quickly running out.
Remember your fellow prisoners who called you Songbird McCain?
Thank you for standing with us and equality for all Sen!  You are a true hero!
Perhaps @realDonaldTrump missed this video....
Get rid of that POS in the White House Please.

Need to purge bad cops across the nation. Top down.
And in our White House. Rock in.  #impeachTrumpnow
This is true moral leadership.  I live in AZ; I hope McCain and military leaders help to hold the line until @GOP finds their moral compass!
Hey cheezMo, what if this is a #FalseFlag...like 99% are to get Attention & Drive the #Fake #Racism BS
Thank you Senator!
Wish our president was this passionate about racism @realDonaldTrump
Seem that @realDonaldTrump should heed these words as well
So what happened to get the general all shrill?
SPEEECH OF THE DECADE
He seems cut from the same cloth as you Senator. Let's find more women and men with this morality.
Will someone please tell Trump this
My. Gen. Silveria could teach the predator a thing or 2 about respect and then he could tell the predator if you can't do this then GET OUT
Amen!
Thanks John, a Korean AF Disable Vet for your stance.
@SenJohnMcCain What are we supposed to do with the president and his racist, bigot entourage?

Trump can’t demand that everyone stand for the flag if he colluded with a foreign Gov't to subvert the very democracy that flag represents. 
This is a real leader.
Please help remove the #RacistInChief
Only in the US congress.....
This what our President should be saying - loud clear and unambiguous!  Thank you Senator and Lt. Gen. Silveria
Thank you, Sir.
keeping racism & bigotry out out the military will be hard when the comander in chief is a racist and a bigot...  just saying
I especially like John MCCain's decency and guts.
John McCain for President now, Gen Silveria for Vice
A true leader!
Thank you Sen. McCain
This is what leadership looks like. Maybe the General can do a power point with graphs for trump.
Thank you sir. There is no place 4 bigot & racism in the Whitehouse
Was he speaking to Donald Trump?
Agreed, but shouldn't this also apply to the Commander in Chief?
how about @realDonaldTrump then?  #ImpeachTrumpNow
Blame the president? What is wrong with u people. McCain done nothing for 30 yrs.
Calm down 100k+ military men and women serve. Always have a very few idiots. Catch them and do something about it teach an old school lesson
My prayers are with and your family right now my friend get well soon
Nor is there a place in our White House for racism.
No there is not, but we now live in TrumpLand. Where the Constitution we vets swore to uphold, the values we shared, mean nothing to CiC
you sure about that John
Agreed. Haha. Si on m'avait dit qu'un jour je retweeterais un tweet de John McCain 
Thank you sir.....
And so who now must GET OUT? Hint: the one who does not treat others with dignity and respect.
Who asked You Songbird
And you, Sir, are the one they all look up to for moral leadership.
I think that is very, very sad. That a General - a man of honor - must do this speech. Poor amarica . We have this Problems in 1939 
How about Integrity?
I will never forget how you Defended Obama when that woman said he was a Muslim. I wish that our current leader  could take  notes from u.
Thank you sir. U are in my thoughts. I must confess, it is somewhat for selfish reasons. The country needs ur stability.
DEAR CURRENT GOP MEMBERS... SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO BECOME A POPULAR HERO? JUST DENOUNCE THIS SHIT, THAT’S LITERALLY ALL
Use the #25thamendment senator. Don’t leave us with this bigot in the White House. It’s time.
Thank you, Senator!  You are creating you legacy through your words and deeds!
Thanks John, I agree with you & I'm proud of you & you've seen the light.I don't agree with Rs. But your the exception, I pray for you daily
You are uniquely strong and intelligent thank you for looking out for our country.
The call is coming from inside the White House...
John, just zip it please!
Truth.  There's no place for cowards & traitors like McCain
And yet your party, for 40 yrs, have employed the politics of hate/fear/division complete w/racist dog whistles.
Powerful!! That folks is what a leader is!!! I’d hit those Normandy beaches again with that General any day any time!!!
I nominate Gen. Silveira as next Dem.4 Pres. Serious!Thisguy is kick-ass! Exactly what I havebeen looking4! No more playnice f--ks! RealDeal
第三次世界大戦が回避された、ということでしょうか。
Moment I'll never forget, Sen., is when you didn't allow woman at campaign stop to lie about Obama. You defended him. Honorable. Thank you.

Sir, you & he portray the quintessential values of leadership. Wonderful to watch it in action.
I  your responses to racism!! Thank you John McCain!!!
