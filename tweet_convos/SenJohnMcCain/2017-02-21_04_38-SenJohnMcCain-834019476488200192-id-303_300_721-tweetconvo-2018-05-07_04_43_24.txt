@kimguilfoyle McCain  needs to be pulled it out of politics he's too old and has a mushy brain

John McCain is still a traitor. The New Benedict Arnold.
@kimguilfoyle McCain U R a traitor to America, never a good soldier, foolishly taking Globalist koolaide. Islam is the enemy!
Senator: I implore you. You are honorable man. Do the right thing. Unleash the good GOP and get rid of Trump. Only hope....
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes the Songbird rode the POW wave as far as it will take him!  He is only POW to benefit!
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes Didn't know the Senator could still read? Past "Best Before" date. Illuminati Retirement Home calling.
Why don't you send a copy of this to Trump and the military men to read?  Trump wants to do the best.
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes anything from McCain is ignored in this house. Time to drain the swamp and vote these traitors out
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes of course he's the leak, the songbird of "Hanoi Hilton".Can not keep a secret...
quit hiding behind the title of Republican....I'm ashamed you were the only choice I had in voting for President.
McCain needs to ride off into the sunset.
And take Graham with him!

@kimguilfoyle The lack of understanding about Muslim goals as stated in the Quran and Sharia Law is disturbing. All in denial
@POTUS as smart as the new NSA may be, he thinks terrorism is un-Islamic?  He needs to study Islam and Mohammed
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes not a fan of McCain. Thanks for your service, now resign.
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes RETIRE ALREADY
@kimguilfoyle Immigrants intent on following Sharia law & or the Quran can never assimilate to western law & culture.
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes   people do not want war, governments want war
McMasters learned the wrong lesson from Afghanistan.
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes What's up your craw, McCain? How can you call yourself a conservative. Washington brain washed
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes
Hey McCain! How about commenting on your soliticing Campaign Contribution from Russia? You SOAB!
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes he needs to go! He needs to be fired! Retire!
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes John McCain I've never seen a republican who thought like a Democrat in my life
sorry john can not trust you anymore. Time to retire.
@kimguilfoyle @nytimes the only bad dream is John McCain.
How about the pipe dream of a Republican Senator who thought and acted like one?
No one but you reads the NYT, but that's only because you use them to leak information to the media
not reading "fake news"..nothing wrong with freedom of the press, but Americans are sick of fakeness of the press
"The hard-learned lesson: (we) must consider social economic & historical factors that constitute the human dimension of war"
You love to keep America at war. "CABAL"
John when will you stand up for all Americans?  We need you now to stop the Trump madness! Please John. Save this country!
- you & @hillaryclinton @georgesoros need to run to an undisclosed private island while you still can. Dumbasses!
John McCain keeps getting the USA into war.
US neglected Afghanistan's Tribal http://Culture.One  cannot build a house on imaginary walls. Tribes are walls
US concentrated on creating government, forgetting the Tribes. Backbone of Afghanistan are the Tribes. Thus failure.
Historicaly Afghan leaders had National Power, Family History, Hospitality. US selected leaders have and had none.
Invaded a country with no weapons of mass destruction? People died and you
re doing what exactly?

the NYT IS FAKE NEWS
If only 45 will listen to his advisors, get out of bed with Russia, and forget about his intern'l business interests
The mere fact pro-WW3 warmonger @SenJohnMcCain endorsed McMaster says he's the wrong person for the job. @nytimes
that was good. And insightful. Keep watch and inform. Thank you.
First the fictitious Dossier, now the leaker. You've shown American who you are
Go home war monger.Were tired of your same old Bull.
Zip it, Traitor! Hopefully we'll see an indictment coming your way.
McCain likes any kind of war; he doesn't care if it's easy or not.
You're a loser pal. What party are you in?
retire ur an embarrassment you went from a hero to a zero you lost get over
Ordinary People can now see how Medias, Corporations,Lobbying controlled past presidents,they steered US,not now
Don't read NY times. Fake news
John, it is time to put aside your personal dislike of POTUS and support his outstanding agenda.
McMaster is nobody's "yes man!"
you are so sick and dangerous, a criminal. Your place is behind bars.
#impeachTrump #now. Please. @gop
you have lost your mind
YOU are the traitor and warmonger.
excellent, thanks for sharing!
Thank you for protecting the 1st amendment!
I have a dream that someday backstabbing losers will leave the Republican party

McCain be the voice of reason in the asylum call for investigation that will get rid of Chump
The kind of real intellect you aren't.

by - Agent of Intolerance
Nothing in the NYSlime is a must read. Very disappointed in the leftist swing you are taking lately Senator.
Did dreaming of war catch your eye, Warmonger?
@DCofStaff @nytimes Hey McCain, what about the Russian mole Trump knew about & allowed inside the Situation Room? #Flynnghazi
COUNTRY YOU DO WORK FOR HILLARY
Actually THIS  is a MUST READ #TRAITORS in OFFICE  @nytimes  https://genemcvay.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/is-fox-news-clueless-or-wittingly-fallacious/ â€¦

RaT
BHO WENT on a bash America apology tour, looks like you're going on a bash President Trump tour.
Trump has You folks on this thread hating Sen McCain and he's your parties leading statesman-his hate knows no limit
no is lifetime politicians like Hillary and McCain that have destroyed this country! Trump will correct
yea trump is the Messiah-to hell with his lies and collusion with Russia assoc. with mob-trump lies
Hard to trust McCain's judgement on McMaster given that he said the Flynn was "great".
must translate!opaque gobbledygook for more US interventionism!just what we don't need!no more #HillarysWars #DTS
We shouldn't go to war unless it's a war we are willing to have our kids die in...they do exist, not very often

is it possible to get Trump to read this???thank you John McCain for posting this article!
Flynn and the republican administration's ties with Russia need to be investigated. #DoYourJob #FlynnResignation #Russia
Weasel McCain busted.  #fired
It's time 2 connect your rhetoric 2 your actions in the senate where U voted 4 Trump 94% of the time!
#ImpeachTrump
Thank you for standing up for integrity and the ideals of America. Thank you for exploring the Russia connection!
Warmongers !
@nytime apologize to injured warriors and the families of fallen soldiers for the war in Iraq.
By far, Senator John McCain will be remembered as one of the very best, this nation had!!!
FREE CYPRUS!!!
is it not just very fake news?
Thank you for a voice of reason in this mess!
Any thought to Domestic matters, #townhall There is alot going on here in AZ we should talk- Cruz killing CFPB for 1
CFPB NEEDS TO BE KILLED  @SenJohnMcCain @nytimes
Feel free to explain 
The CFPB prevents lenders allowing bad loans which the taxpayers later cover
Feel free to explain WHY I need another gov agency to protect me! I DON'T @SenJohnMcCain @nytimes
Fake news! Oh wait. Is it fake if it's from a Trump appointment? I'm so confused. 
I am hopeful that your integrity keeps up !! You could be the man who saves the world !!!!!!
Songbird McCain, u traitor, globalist, liberal, daddy's girl! I hope they vote your sold out ass out of the senate!
This is a man among men! Someone with honor rarely seen in politics. His views on Trump show the same honor. A true HERO
I'm a dem but when McCain stood up for Obama at a campaign rally when a supporter called him an Arab I became a lifelong fan.
time to stand up for Americas choice and do what this country needs..predicting a WWIII was a poor choice of words
I once had a coach that was NOT well liked, but when my # was called to run with the ball, I still gave him my best
excellent recommendation thank you
you are not fooling Americans with YOUR "credit deserved" tweets. Congrats to @mike_pence for a job well done!!!
I would rather have a leader who demands good performance than one who pretends he is a good leader..make amends now
yes, Trump gave you and many others some offending remarks..and AMERICANS responded by agreeing with him. accept it
either get on the team or resign. America has been divided long enough by DC attitudes..get off your high horse
Did #GeorgeSoros tell u to tweet this and denounce your Commander & Chief on foreign soil? Shame on you. #TermLimits
Agree! Pathetic!
you should be using your political strength to help our president and our country wrong the way you r nonsupportive
much disappointed in a man I voted for and recent behavior. Have lost respect for you and your American Spirit.
I think it is time @gopleader & @potus repeal and replace you. Traitor to Party, @potus & nation. #TermLimits #MAGA

I read that you think the NSC team is great, so you approve of Bannon now?
there is hope because of patriots like yourself. Thank you for putting our country first!
McCain is a traitor and collaborated with the enemy while in captivity .
You attack a war hero because he disagrees with the president? This is slander and it doesn't help.
john stop hating our country and stop calling OUR President a dictator.
They need to recall you
your favorite liberal rag huh liberal?
traitor
Thanks for the tip. Will do .
Respect your military service. Sir, please forgive President Trump, your debasing yourself, overseas. Shameful.
mclame u complain bout DT but who r u= a womanizer,wrecked 3 jets,POW's who don't think much of u,Iraq yellow caker
it's time for you to go home to Arizona song bird

.  Hey it is time for you to get your ensure and take your delusional pills
Why are you trying to destroy everything President Trump is trying to do for us??!
DEAR  Senator, A picture is worth a THOUSAND words.
good article. Show it to president Bannon!
Everybody hates you..... Literally
I do not give any credence to McCain's recommendation because I have lost all respect in him.
me too brother ...He us an idiot and a traitor to our president . He is the reason Obama won.
