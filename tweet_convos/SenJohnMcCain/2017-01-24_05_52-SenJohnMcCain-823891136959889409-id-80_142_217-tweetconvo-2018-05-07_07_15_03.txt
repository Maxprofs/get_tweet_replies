@LindseyGrahamSC and the world, swiftly. 21.
I hope you are going to be a watchdog for the America people in this post fact/alternate reality time.
@LindseyGrahamSC asking you to make its conclusion fittingly unprecedented as well by impeaching this threat to the US & 20/
@LindseyGrahamSC begin impeachment proceedings in short order, for our own interests and safety, and those of the 6/
#trump is strategic failure of the US
Favoring election of Trump, someone obviously wanted to weaken the US.The Q is: what is z resp of the congress.
@askjillian @WSJ I love it. McCain is an idiot. Time for this old coot to retire.
@LindseyGrahamSC election has been a terrible national trauma and he makes it worse every day with the irrational, 16/
Do something about this guy, Senator. He's your party's man. It's your party's action. It's on you.
@LindseyGrahamSC embarrassing, ignorant, reckless conduct. It's already taken a terrible toll on people and continues 17/
@LindseyGrahamSC international community. dt is not going to change. Things will only get worse.That's been borne out over 7/
Who'd have guessed, China is where Trumps merch is made.
@askjillian @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ How do we know that wasn't photoshopped?
viva Trump
NEW TRADE agreements MUST be done IN REPLACEMENT of TPP etc. Current BENEFIT ONLY foreign interests-NOT American!
Outsourcing is over All aboard McCain Stop being an obstructionist You lost presidency because you had nothing to offer american people

I'll be sure top read it right away Songbird. @WSJ
Actual, real news! 
@LindseyGrahamSC and so does the rest of the world. Everything else about this election has been unprecedented, so, I'm 19/
@LindseyGrahamSC to do so. I think, an unprecedented global protest is very telling. Americans need an end to this mess 18/
@LindseyGrahamSC likely it becomes that he will do serious damage, in one way or another. This entire campaign and 15/
@LindseyGrahamSC on many fronts as long as he stays and the longer he stays, the more that danger grows and the more 14/
@LindseyGrahamSC still, we need to gather the fortitude to remove him from office as soon as possible. We are in danger 13/
@LindseyGrahamSC apparent nature that suggests he would do so. I suppose it's worth a shot - albeit a brief one - but, 12/
@LindseyGrahamSC the sooner we act, the better. Many have spoken of pressing dt to resign - I don't see anything in his 11/
@LindseyGrahamSC right now, it has fallen to you both to be the compass of the gop.I know the whole situation stinks, but 10/
@LindseyGrahamSC and quite without hyperbole a threat to the US and the world. For whatever reasons that don't matter much 9/
@LindseyGrahamSC many months. It's not a partisan issue. He is unstable, dangerous, incredibly divisive and antagonistic, 8/
@LindseyGrahamSC we're going to need folks of real integrity like yourselves b/c we are, unfortunately, going to need to 5/
@LindseyGrahamSC lacking in sufficient knowledge and judgment for the job - and that's just off the top of my head. So, 4/
@LindseyGrahamSC surrounded by a team of low integrity, not terribly loyal to American principles and people, seriously 3/
@LindseyGrahamSC that dt is unstable, unfit, corrupt, not in touch with reality, dictatorial, possibly compromised, 2/
@LindseyGrahamSC I take no pleasure in saying so in that it makes me sad for my country, but it is fast becoming clear 1/
You lost to Hussein, it's your fault we are in this mess
if this is the wrong direction, man up and fight it on behalf of America and your constituents
.@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ & @cnni @andrewcnn thank you for calling attention to this.
And, for the benefit of all, could you re-iterate your position on this action?
Songbird of Nam, your followers are braindead.
China won't bite!
Don't worry nudity of Dongfeng!

McCain, get over it and start working with President Trump.
Talk about leading from behind.

The Global Elites are done.
Will you save us from Devos please????? And Tillerson??? And RUSSIA????
he did it for China whom he owes hundreds of millions of dollars. China is the beneficiary. Don't you get it??? Wake up!
@askjillian @WSJ What are you going to do about it, Senator? Not SAY about it, DO about it?
America's most compelling leaverage is the size of our consumer markets and the productivity of our work force.
REPUBLICANS ALWAYS BACK NAFTA, TPP, DEMS AND UNIIONS NEVER, ALWAYS RIPS OFF THE WORKING/MIDDLE CLASS, STOP FEARMONGERING
not a surprise. The GOP legislature made their bed by being such a 8+ year "make Obama failed presidency!"
Nope.  WSJ is biased.
Well ur party put him in power.
damn John, just swith sides to a Democrat. You align more and more with them every day. Sad
He is aligning with what he thinks is best
"Trade Deficit" is CODE for "You Got Screwed sucker!"
You stand alone on this! We cant all be winners,now can we?You cant expect him to own a bad deal, when he can get better
Yes!! The same,Sen. John McCain
must read? How about ''must do something" you ineffectual mutt. SMDH
I worry Potus doesn't fully understand anything he is signing/suggesting.Whoever he is listening to is running things
maybe you should've been more vocal when Obama wanted it
SELL OUT. HOW CAN YOU FACE AMERICAN PEOPLE.Conflicts yet bet your bank account is bigger. So sad.I once respected you.
Give up John....it's over.
If a trade war happens it could be a boom for manufacturing in the US
Trump is creating tensions..rumblings in Japan.  Japan is an important player in the Pacific. He has lots to learn.
I voted for Trump.  I did not vote for you.  We are on a new journey.
The point is that if it doesn't benefit the US then we should not agree to it, America First !!!
Trump didn't retreat !! It was never ratified !!!! what was the benefit to the American people again ?
really? Prove that. I'll wait for you, loser, to verify your own statement, which is impossible, Commie.
Weeeammp!! the BS buzzer goes off when you talk.
it's so great tri see you working hard to make this #POTUS successful #MAGA
