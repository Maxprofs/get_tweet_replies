Thank you for your service and speaking up against dishonor. Be well.
RETWEET if you support John McCain
@Northvike you have always been a bully and for liberal ideology. Why do you call yourself a Republican? Americans who voted for U disagree
Are u calling McCain a bully? Trump is the picture of what a bully is, lies & unfulfilled promises to get elected & loyal only 2 family.
@Northvike you don't have a clue what all POTUS has accomplished thus far. It's divided GOP and McCain causing failure of ACA NOT PASS IT.
No healthcare bill since 1 up for vote sucked.Trump promised healthcare but didn't take time 2 find out Repubs had no plan & he has 0 ideas.
@Northvike TROLL
Back at ya
Support what ? The fact you just voted to screw the president and your state . Oh yes be proud
our tax dollars are paying for elected politicians to make media appearances & interviews instead of working to help American ppl. Disgrace
Some maybe! This is 1 of the very few Senators with the guts to stand up for right! I'm a Rep & McCain is the best! Remember, this man is>>
U clearly haven't researched his military history. I was Mccain guy too until he started going back on promises and i looked into his past

Interesting Expose on John McCain by Vietnam Vets & POW's. True? You Decide. https://www.pscp.tv/w/bFBfzzUwMDgwNTJ8MXpxS1ZSbllZZHdLQgiCAJTpvzJukEoP9P2woondKaJQXAglTs3hmOW5RueV …

I am sick of Mcain.
I wish you health Sir. Thank you for sticking up for us who will forever be fighting an illness, hopefully with healthcare. Keep fighting!
Insurance premiums are going up 30% next year. I'm sure the residents of Arizona are excited about that.


your nothing but a burden to your state - how glad they will be when you are gone
McCain gave you Obamacare with higher premiums and illegal immigration. Are you fools?
He knows he is dying.  Wtf.  Why is he still so power hungry?
Thanks John for rising up, a true patriot, this 71 year old Vet salutes, God guide you and comfort you in your current battle
Hey, John did you get your medical procedure done at a VA Hospital?
Give yourself Obamacare. We The People voted it out. You won't leave office soon enough, traitor. We EMPLOY you. You don't employ us.
Traitor?  What have u done for our glorious nation?  Sit on your ass and use Twitter? Shut up, sit down and never call a vet/pow a traitor
No more McCain. If election was today, you lose.
Says someone who probably doesn't live in Az.  Think I'll ignore your uneducated opinion
Actually it is very educated. McCain knows there are over 500 open Uranium Mines ln N AZ, leaking into Navajo water. He is doing nothing.
How anyone can support this traitor is beyond to me McCain karma is a b**** and it's coming to get you soon I pray
You cool dude,John! Health to you!
Вы крутой чувак Джон!Здоровья вам!
#Resign and go spend time with your buddy #Soros
Comrade McCain are these companies where u get some of your kick backs seeing how u side with the demo-liars on repeal of #Ocrapacare
You are only in AZ because you are sick. You never showed up for the voters
U blew the vote and the fled.  Retire..
TRUMP SIGNED THE #RussiaSanctions Bill...KEEP YOU PROMISE MCCAIN
Trump was forced to sign because a veto would have been overruled by greater than 2/3 vote per constitution. That would have hurt his ego
Did you tell Mesa that because of you, my family will be skipping fall league baseball?

We support you as well Retire then expire!!!!!!
We love you, @SenJohnMcCain and appreciate all YOU do for #Arizona #MIDC @MesaChamber
@Northvike McCain turn his back on us. If not him best Affordable Care Act would have passed. All them's are determined to impeach Trump
Wow. You egotistically screw the country with a purely vengeance vote, yet get excited holding a banner with two people. #rino
vote all republicans out you can see they do not know how to govern tax replacement in a week come on like Repal and replace in 5 days?
Retire
WHAT WAS HIS VOTE HERE?
What memes of Trump would you like to ignore?  You can't scream about things like this and turn a blind eye to his hypocrisy
Please, who in their right mind supports anybody on either side in this corrupt Congress. Especially Mr. Corrupt himself, @SenJohnMcCain.
Too bad you just doubled ness insurance rates with you ego centered no vote breaking your word and promise to repeal and replace revengeful
While your recuperating would you please take the time and explain this doc.
Woopdy doo! You need to change to DemonRat!
John I'm sorry to hear about your health, however should retire. Your not representing conservatives and ur hatred for Trump is nauseating.
Traitor
No they don't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHILL!
Bill was drafted by your GOP in the senate not the president
Then how come no democrats and many GOP never saw it or had inputs in the drafting of it?
U can't have everyone drafting a bill. Everyone had an opportunity to view it once it was ready. Dems are obstructionist they won't make
They had no Dems providing input!  Total BS since it affects everyone. GOP was not elected by 100% of pop&ignoring other inputs is childish
DEMS ignored republicans input when drafting and passing OCare. Why the double standard?
I didn't say it wast wrong then.  I don't support Obamacare but I also don't blindly trust GOP. I want consensus debate and cooperation
"On the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. MT 28 specifically for JM
President and then say that the senators are independent of president. Do what's right regardless of what president wants. This healthcare
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for again, being brave enough to stand up for the people you work for.
Who is he working for?  Not the people in AZ who had a 116% increase in their O'care premiums.
Ok hope you're doing well but please don't come back to vote thumbs down on conservative issues for no other reason than to be against

Donald Trump's approval rating just hit a new low http://ti.me/2vpImwR
