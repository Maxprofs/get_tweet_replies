add Trump spending taxpayer $$$$$ to play golf and globe trot.  Where's the inauguration money/entertainment money?
What patient advocacy group or health professional group has expressed support for #GrahamCassidy? Many have condemned. Vets will be hurt
Propaganda Kim, simply not true. New bill much like present bill, but shifts financial responsibility to the states, which SHOULD share load
The Graham-Cassidy health bill is incredibly unpopular... for good reason... don't go along with it just because of your friendship...
My dad died in Vietnam but not for you or any of Congress to take away my healthcare or diminish it
Don't support #GrahamCassidy
Army pilot
I pay 100% of my premiums
Since #Obamacare began
Have been to MD once every year
Healthy American 
Hope my premiums help another w care
MCCAIN IS A DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY.  BREAKING NEWS:
Hudson Report - Naming Names: John McCain: http://youtu.be/27BuVXz3Y-I?a  via @YouTube
Get a clue sir, Obamacare is wasting citizens money!!!

So you rein in wasteful spending by giving more money to the people that waste that money.  Makes total sense.
POTUS doing everything right. Americans would have a HealthCare Bill if it wasn't for you McCain
With all due respect, what makes you confident giving the Pentagon that much $$$ will lead them to identify and eliminate wasteful spending?
Make certain that happens. Then you could divert money and really do not need more. It can to to education and healthcare.
And it took your own many years to do this. Oh yea, when Trump took office...
1.7 million veterans have Medicaid. Please don’t vote to threaten this.
Vote no to #GrahamCassidy: you want to be remembered for your service, consider it a service to the 52% of adults w/ preexisting conditions.
agreed! counting on @SenJohnMcCain to do the right thing supporting the health of our nation. vote no, on Graham-Cassidy.
Trumps salary =wasteful spending
How about pay raises to active duty and retiree service members.  Stop abusing our warriors who serve or who spent their lives serving.
Does that mean you will be " eliminated "  you are most definitely "troubled "
Even facing death you still like war. #sad
Start with having all of Congress pay for their own medical coverage!End the free ride.Americans all pay for health care and so should they!
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy
For-profit sick care is broken. @SenSanders #MedicareForAll is better value & outcomes. Also good for #startups & business investment #jobs.
Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy plan. Where is your heart? Don't vote to leave millions w/o care.
PLEASE VOTE NO AGAINST #TRUMPCARE BE THE VOICE FOR US ALL DO NOT LET IT PASS HOLD YOUR GROUND DO NOT GIVE IN PLEASE!!!!!!! #Impeach45 
VOTE YES ON CASSIDY GRAHAM BILL DON'T FORGET YOUR CONSTITUENTS
unnecessary defense spending?but invest in warfighters?Oy vey, this is up your alley,not healthcare.
Great. Now kill Graham Cassidy so you can fix Heath Care.
VOTE NO on replace and repeal.You work for the peoples of the United States Of America and AZ., not for Donald Trump. VOTE NO Thank you

@SenJohnMcCain Graham-Cassidy bill will remove close to 2 million vets off of Medicaid. I don't think that was your intention. Couldn't be!
Lol - you must have no scruples to pretend that you care about waste and abuse
By What? We have the smallest military since the cold war ended, yet we pay 300% as much. Quit buying super weapons that don't work.
Hey John  R u just now figuring it out?  Why are you sooo slooooow?
Like Republicans give a fuck about waste. How about a bipartisan bill to impeach Trump. He's spending a lot ya know+Several biss conflicts
In other words, take from service members and give to military industrial complex
All we care about Senator is that you put your money where your mouth is and vote against the new HC bill that will cause loss of insured.
If you "reluctantly" vote yes on #GrahamCassidyِ it's about money, not human lives. People will die for a tax break.
Vote no on ACA repeal bill! You said regular order. Are you a man of your word?
Do you intend to vote for any healthcare bill that hasn't had a CBO score or appropriate public hearings?
I am ashamed of you McCain. Voting to take away healthcare is wrong.
What's the point of having worlds most powerful military to protect its LAND if its people are unprotected by Heath CARE?
You were courageous in standing up to cruel Trumpcare bill before; please continue to vote conscience over party re: cruel Graham-Cassidy!
Don't take insurance away from millions. Don't late cruelty be your legacy.
You on tv recommending new ocare repeal should goto committee to discuss n amend U had 7 yrs to do it! cut the crap we're out of patience!!
is thsi what they are giving you in exchange of your vote for #GrahamCassidy ???? come on man!
Took 30 years in Congress to get this done? Explains the fine fix you got us into Ollie. RETIRE Brutus, fade away
Lying deep state MONSTER, it's about controlling American citizens and has been since day 1

I agree with my friend @SenJohnMcCain: a sustainable solution to healthcare requires a bipartisan solution & regular order. 
Graham-Cassidy isn't a healthcare insurance solution for MILLIONS. Sir, you know that. Full CBO before you vote.
. Traitor john, trying to change ones sex is a waste of money, just look at yourself.
What did u do the past 8 yrs for our Military Equipment. You r shameful! So darn disappointing
Biggest wasteful spending, DWEEB's salary and "the family", plus payments to HIS PROPERTIES! DISGUSTING!!
Please don't vote to take away our healthcare. Do what is right. Please.
Be a humanitarian & vote no on health(non)care bill. Have mercy on us. Fix Obamacare w bipartisanship so all benefit.
#SaveACA
Have you seen a chart that shows how much premiums will go up for folks with preexisting conditions? It's criminal. Vote NO.  #GrahamCassidy
Cut all @SecretService protection for traitor @DonaldJTrumpJr and that psychopath @EricTrump as a start. #TrumpColluded #RussiaGate #Impeach
John caused this shortfall: https://www.cato.org/blog/john-mccain-americas-foreign-policy-loose-cannon … Stop your gold mining a problem you created. @foxnation
Americans need you to make another stand against the GOP killing millions of Americans with healthcare bill!  Plz don't let us down!!

#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
Like you know anything about reducing spending.

People like me, fighting #cancer will 1st go broke, then die, & leave families in crippling debt. Anyone who supports this is Un-American
Please vote NO on Graham/Cassidy repeal bill. Let the Senate return to normal order and get CBO score. Thank you for your service, Senator.
McCain, we are losing our democracy.  Please stand firm and insist on full CBO score and real hearings.
Great start John! We also need to control borders if only to stop drug traffic. And invest in private healthcare payment alternatives. MAGA!
vote NO on this BAD health bill
Please remember the ill!  I believe in you and your life experience will guide you to keep ACA.
Reinvest in Healthcare Senator McCain too!  We love our military but also love our elderly, disabled and kids.
Graham-Cassidy to get 2 minutes of debate?  That isn't regular order that is a sham government.
Please help American people Mr McCain! Save our health care! Please!
funny,the programs weren't troubled before...You republicans have a knack for screwing things up...
Are you prepared to take HC from children/elderly/disabled without Regular Order?
I own businesses in AZ
I have stopped donating 2GOP

Congress 
Don't hurt us sick or disabled like Mike! Please VOTE NO #GrahamCassidy!Rich don't need tax cuts!These people need care!
If you are really for veterans, you CAN'T vote for #GrahamCassidy. It would kill many of them.
#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
Let's discuss wasteful defense spending, shall we
All talk. 'Maverick' @SenJohnMcCain likes center stage theatrics but while he has full health benefits he'll gut the healthcare Vets rely on

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
Vote no to #GrahamCassidyBill 
You know it's not ok. Harmful for millions. Keep your word on process.
You talk like republican when running, but vote like a progressive in Washington. You cannot be trusted, you need to retire.
Douchey Ducey!
Please vote no on #CassidyGraham wealthcare bill. Charging more for or denying coverage for pre-existing conditions is a death sentence.
I know you'll not gonna vote for this THANK YOU! #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacist #NaziBucketChallenge  #TheDouchebagChallenge #GOPisComplicit
But what about health care?
Go for it! Vote YES for FY18NDAA and NO forGraham-Cassidy. We need a lean, strong, military AND we need COMMITTEE REVIEW and CBO ANALYSIS.
Reinvest in American health. Vote NO on #Graham-Cassidy. Work together to fix what's wrong now. Bipartisan solution is possible.
Under #GrahamCassidyBill , people with metastatic cancer will pay $142,650 more a year to get coverage. That is a death sentence. NOT REFORM
Elimitate unnecessary spending, fire the swamp, you included!
I trust U on this issue & I eagerly await U defending ACA from gutting like GrahamCassidy. No way this bill is good 4 AZ. Ducey is sell out
Sounds like a Trump lie to me...You gotta come straight with us from now on Senator...Trump has exposed you all. Time for some honesty sir.
We need to all work together to improve health care.  Please vote no to repeal.
No to GrahamCassidy. An improvement is an improvement. GrahamCassidy is not an improvement.
Good stuff!
Please vote no on new Graham plan to repeal ACA.  I look to you as a courageous person.  Do not do this to millions of people.
Stop Paying for Trump's weekend trips. If he wants to go somewhere special tell him to pay for it. We can't afford a billionaire president.
Vote NO on the healthcare bill your party is trying to push
Please don't take our healthcare vote no Aca has saved my life and continues to. Don't I deserve the same as you?
Please just stay in AZ we don't need anymore of your so called help in DC Thank you in advance.
Yeah I think we're done listening to you about defense spending
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
I asked people to share what it's like to live in a country with universal health care. The responses that came in were incredible. 
40% of #warfighters are racial & ethnic minorities
People TARGETED FOR MURDER by armed white supremacists EXEMPTED FROM DUTY as #unfit.
It's time for African-Americans & Latinos to #BoycottTheMilitary.

@DeptofDefense
PLEASE DON'T VOTE TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S HEALTHCARE
Latest GOP healthcare repeal lets ins. co's charge sick ppl more! So those w/ pre-existing conditions may lose coverage. Do the right thing.
NO on the Graham. REGULAR ORDER!!!!!
Vote no on the cruel Graham Cassidy bill that will take coverage from millions.
Who cares we'll all be dying or dead from your yes vote on healthcare. You can defend the 1% I guess
Vote no on Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill it will only hurt the people that support, including vets!
Retire, John.
I do not consider healthcare to be wasteful spending.

But I love Americans.
I'm all in. Are you all in protecting healthcare?
Agreed. Early $$ info on Graham Cassidy looks bad & it's irresponsible to vote on legislation w/o full info on deficit impact/lost coverage.
Resign.  You are an embarrassment.
Shut up..you're a FSB Bot.
