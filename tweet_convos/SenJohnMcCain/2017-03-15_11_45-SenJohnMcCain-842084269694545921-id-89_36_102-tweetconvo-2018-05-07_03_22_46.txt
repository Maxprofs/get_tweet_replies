Disgracing yourself and family every day.  SAD

ELECTIONS ARE COMING UP. REMEMBER THAT, JOHN MCCAIN
fake news for fake Americans you sick Soros sellout watch your back patriots abound
#songbird Why just Marchmadnes? You're crazy the other 11 months too #KeK #MAGA #MAGAXXL
Another waste of taxpayer dollars. Thank you Senator for all of your hard work, retire.
STOP Giving This EVIL #SaudiArabia Puppet McCain TV Time! @espn @realDonaldTrump @greta
keep doing things like this, Senator. It makes us all safer.
you are an old crazy and you belong in a nursing home
Instead of playing march madness work for a living like the rest of us,
you are a joke are you enjoying working with the fake news
Surprised you know what month it is!
instead of NCAA - how about confirm a Supreme Court justice #DoYourJob
"Hey look! I'm goofing off on the job people who are paying me!"
oh SO important
March Madness is Trump as President.
Why don't you get off @CNN and your ass and start working for conservative America?
hey look another senator doing something other than work. Shocker!!!!
Insane Mccain needs to be takin out of his + OUR misery. He funds terrorism. DIE Mccain!

Go Xavier! 
After impugning the dignity & reputation of a fellow senator, John McCain likes to spend his time dicking around w/the fellas
McCain traitor and sedition. Resign or be recalled.
Vote for Trump to release his tax returns.  More important than sports.
Seriously, if the West’s survival depends on Montenegro’s inclusion in NATO, we should all be heading for the bunkers!
All you do is talk!
and that's what it's screwed up control needs. NOT
BS we all know pos #traitor #globalist #liar #AntiAmerican #McCain #bracket looks like 
@Potus @jeffsessions #ArrestMcCain, #Soros funded #traitor #liar #globalist #treasonous 
The only March Madness is 'WE the PEOPLE" are MAD in March that you are still here!
Retire already. Go golfing, take up painting - something. Leave us alone.
Do you really have time for this BS when @POTUS doesn't have a full cabinet?
Are you picking University of Russia to win it all? You should retire already! Enough
how about you focus on doing what WE are paying you for and get back to work!
Wow, maybe in your next life you can be a sports announcer with your pal Obama.
NOBODY CARES ARE YOU TRYING TO BE OBAMA?  #RetireMcCain #McCainisabackstabber
That's so important while the country and the government are in chaos.
Frankly wouldn't u rather hve #McCain occupied w #bracket thn undrmnin @POTUS?
PROUD Sen McCain not afraid 2stand up 4COUNTRY B4 PARTY 
Which country? Cuz #McCain certainly isnt standin up 4 USA #DTS
Just needs that face time. Work time??   JOKING BIG TIME
I've got Arizona going deep.

March Madness is the central tenet of the Republican party.
I bet he picks the @DNC to win it all!

@POTUS @ESPNAndyKatz @ABC @UofA as important as march madness bracket. We know where your heart is
Let's talk Trump/Putin connection, ok? That's the real March Madness.
very desperate Democrats. John Mc can't decide what party he belongs to.
Why don't you just do your fn job and not B.B. Bracket
We have Russia in the WH! Get them out!
#russiagate
let's see health insurance military.bugets and preparedness and working for America not
I wish you were our President sir!! #respect
Please talk March madness AFTER you investigate Russia. Thank you.
Are you sure that Putin will not influence the outcome??
Bear Down Arizona!
This is the bullshit we elect and pay you for?
UofA chokes like you impeaching the crook in chief.
You meant Obama right as the crook in chief?
Trump would have gotten 100% right if he did this. No one knows more about NCAA. Believe me.
Keep talking basketball.  You sure dont know how to be a conservative  RINO
you have already talked way too much. Such a disappointment. 2 bad I can't "not" vote 4u
Really? Glad your focused on important matters.
where is @realDonaldTrump? Usually @POTUS44 did it with charm and class
he does not like basketball- too many black guys.
RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA @CIA @FBI
