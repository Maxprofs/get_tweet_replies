Are you suggesting that it's not McCain with the leaders of ISIS? Arming/ training ISIS is looney. Wake up- along with your 197 followers
Who do you think these "moderate rebels" were, simpleton?
ISIS aren't the only rebels in Syria. There are moderate ones too.
The moderate rebels beheaded small children.
Americans have killed many children in Iraq. Should they be classified as terrorists?
the definition of hypocrisy when McCain gifts Israel $$$Billions in weapons to support Israel's insanely brutal apartheid oppression.

The Rohingya hack American Heads off. Why help  them, they won't ever appreciate it. But we would appreciate it if Obamacare is repealed.
Mr McCain F—k u; ur a traitor from Vietnam with daddy’s help
I am sitting military action against you
You should try in Syria at first.Our #Myanmar is struggling against #illegal #Migrant #Bengali #Terrorists now
This Year's World Top Hypocrite Award goes to you Mr Senator,
supporting Terrorist #Pakistan & #Saudi Armies & talking abt Human Rights
Get well soon, beat cancer, you are warrior, you would do this
Great.  We can't fund the military there, so they can kill their own people!
McCain's tweets are written by one of his liberal-leaning staffers who are motivated to polish McCain's anti-Trump legacy.

Humanity does not end with borders. Great move by John! This is the reason why he's so highly respected. A true Maverick with moral justice!

You mean now that you've been connected to the atrocities you are going to disconnect! Do you really believe ppl are that stupid,seriously!

Please do more Sir. If we are to be a Nation that stands for certain values, how can we look away again.
Sir you being a man of compassion understand that the systematic ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya are unacceptable.  Military action maybe?

How about doing your job at home quit worrying about other countries
I'd say he's done his job very well
Human right abuse? So we have to sit and watch those bengali terrorist killing Myanmar civilians for no reason ? SMDH
Exactly no human rights for indian terrorism
Revealing fake photos used by  Ro lobbyists n Islamic world  
#myanmar Burma
Legendary john McCain
Says a war criminal
What about you doing something to end human rights abuses in Yemen funded by U.S. tax dollars & perpetrated by our Saudi & Israeli "allies"?
Do you have courage Mr. McCain. I guarantee, you cannot even repatriate 1 refugees back to berma.
Good 1st step, Senator; but, what about the responsibility to protect?  Does it not apply when the population being cleansed is brown? #R2P
Thank you.
So why don't you take them into your country. Problem solved.
How much do we have to say that No ROHINGYA NOROHINGYA. They all invalid Bengāladish people. Don,t be stupid.
Do you mean , Human Rights” is only for Bingalis, not for Myanmar ethnic groups. You are also an extremist.
Senator McCain do you actually read these tweets or someone reads them for you? We're just the people that voted for you#
Senator McCain let's focus on repealing Obamacare and replacing and text cuts for the middle class in tax reform #It'sTime





Thanks for your bold statement
So it is very obious that you have only one ear, not a piars , coz u only listen to one side and neglect the others
Is it human right? Rohingya terrorists with refugee men and adult boys have attacked Burmese's police posts and burning houses in Rakhine st
What about Yemen?
Learn from that McCain. Dont trust media.
Migrant Crisis - The Real Story behind Migrants being portrayed as "Victims" - The footage Main Stream Media refuses to broadcast 
Thanks Senator! Will love to share the digital footprints of Genocide.
Go retire, your getting tiring
only symbolic at this point
US is now officially racist & bigots so you won't get coop from Rs or .@realDonaldTrump  - Rohingya are Muslims
McFrankenstain & some of his friends:
Given human rights abuses against Palestinians, I will also seek to reward #Israel with even more tax $$ to slaughter kids
#BDS
#ICC4Israel
Praise Allah
Well done.
For those looking for a way to practically support the victims of genocide in #rohingya go to http://www.burmamuslims.org   & start making calls!
Thank you for ur solidarity for #RohingyaMuslims It is important to understand that all lives matter & we should stand up for the oppressed
Where's #Burma? I don't think that country exists.
Burma?
(What decade does this idiot live in?)
Trying to get close to China's borders
McCain your medical condition deems you not fit to serve. Just resign. Get your rest.


Myanmar is not land for terrorist !!!
Your american troops did more human rights abuses in Vietnam and middle east . Now you are pointing out on small country . What a shame?
Is human right only for Bengalis(so called Rohingyas)? Isn't it for other,native Rakhine ethnics who are in http://trouble.You 're not.
If you like them, Bangali, pls bring them to your country. We thank you ever and ever.
Pls explore the real world rather than refer the nonsense news. Bangali terrorists attacked 30 police forces and killed many innocents.
Bravo...Senator have courage and take a note of human rights violations committed by India in Jammu & Kashmir.
Didnt mccain leave a wife who waited for him for a new wife that got him into politics
And didn't our State DEPT signal that our Great Country is no longer interested in leading on human rights?
all those Vietnamese children killed by bombs from bombers you escorted: got any news for them or their parents ?
@dwolfe70
@dwolfe70
@dwolfe70
@dwolfe70
I fully expect Al Qaeda to become 'rebels' in #Burma, and for the U.S to call them 'moderate'. They never change the script.
ASSAD REGIME STILL MURDERING . INNOCENT SYRIANS
@albd1971 
Now, where are Super Nation??
Please stay away, everywhere you go you leave a bigger mess behind.
Just before Islamic religious holiday many Muslim civilians killed or suffered, recpect holy Pls
Do it please.  Genocide
Genocider just yesterday threatened to annihilate one Asian country but today weeping over his Muslim fellows. What a travesty
YES
There's your tax cut
Thank you sir.
You should seek to bomb Burma....no? Regime change, no? You bombed Saddam for something he NEVER had yet here you have a holocaust.

An important step. The US needs to also consider unilateral sanctions against the Burmese military and leadership.
Who cares? US need Burma but burma do
Bold move, bravo sir

Nope, he knows what you are and

OMG! ISIS-lover has spoken! We are so relieved now!

Thank you, Senator. Ethnic cleansing must be stopped immediately and perpetrators held accountable. #SaveRohingya @DarrenF52613413
Glad you found something constructive to do.
Excellent! Now work more incisively at home to stop trend of kleptocratic autocracy. You've got knowledge/ clout. Can u summon the will?
Thank you. Now, please turn your attention to human rights abuses in US being perpetrated/encouraged/enabled by current administration.
Why don't you stay out of Burma's business, you have no clue do you?   Start doing your job at home before interfering.
At the same time you continue to support those who are killing and raping #Yazidi ppl . #Burma
Why not ask ur friends in Saudi Arabia to take all those Rohingyas.who are you tell a sovereign country what to do. #Burma
Human rights are abused here... support Medicare For All!
Thank you.

Thank you!
Good idea

Mr.Mccain,
Why do  say so like that?When US had attacked to world trade center,even your US had war to  Afghanistan !Was that Human Right?
@SamanthaJPower + @SenJohnMcCain = #hypocrisy 
#Compassion is something different.
Thanks Dear.
@austinramzy It is essential to draw a distinction between the armed forces and the fragile proto-democratic government
Please worry about the American health care, American jobs, American economy, American veterans, not about Rohingya.
