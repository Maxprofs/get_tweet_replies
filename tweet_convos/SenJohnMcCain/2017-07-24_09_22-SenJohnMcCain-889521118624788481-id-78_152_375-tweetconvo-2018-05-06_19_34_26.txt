Hey what do we have to do to get FOREIGN MILITARY BASES in the US? I mean, how many do we have in other countries?
John McCain the president end support for the Syria rebels you need to call the president
John yours and Hillarys covert war is ending. Your ending. #drainthesewer one at a time.
Trump condemned many more thousands of Syrians to death & millions more to oppression by abandoning Syrians fighting for freedom, Senator.
Stop watching CNN & Vice no Sarin was ever used. TOUCH SARIN GAS WITH BARE SKIN & YOU'RE DEAD. McCains ISIS rebel false flag Chlorine gas
BBC News - Syria war: 2016 deadliest year yet for children, says Unicef
If you trust anything the @BBCWorld @CNN or any other mainstream war propaganda media says you are the problem.
Affordable Care is working for millions. Repubs. can change the name, fix it, quit sabotaging. What about mental care for young adults, NoR?
Trump's muddle? He inherited the Syrian problem.
"McCain's Muddle" :
You are voting on party lines with a party run by this monster
@realDonaldTrump is going to create more terrorists by pulling the support for arming the rebels. That's how this crap got started anyway
Another dysfunctional action from a malfunctioning cabinet.....
Retire McCain
Negotiations in Astana, Kazakhstan started Peace process. They will be successful and include all opposition. Afterwards-President elections
I don't think so John.  It is you Neocons and Dems who have murder the Syrians and destabilized the region. Trump trying to bring peace
Please make a swift recovery so you can continue to embarrass yourself in front of our nation. Traitor.
You want a failed state like Libya & gave arms to ISIS for years who cut kids heads off. We want you investigated for Syria not your advice
Remember Trump is the Great Negotiator, right? Perhaps he wont be able to negotiate himself out of the Russian links.Time to face the truth!
Ever notice the pattern that when USA gets involved in Middle East, millions die.  Most by our hand and we end up spending into oblivion?
You are not the President of the USA. You had your chance in 2008 and blew it.
Do you have anything positive to say?  Your party is in charge but can't get anything done. Why? Blame yourself and Lindsey . Jeb lost
No muddle by POTUS. Muddle was by those who did nothing under Obama Senator McCain. Next time, be honest, Run on the Democratic ticket.
Your a good man Sen McCain. Your genuine love and service for America will always be your legacy. Prayers of healing and recovery. Thanks
Senator McCain, Sir. Get better. The country needs you. Please help us install a President with American values soon.
That's true for Great America too. It won't come to the negotiating table until it has to. What a novel concept!
R E T I R E
obvious that russia is in control of trump who was likely compromised during campaign and blackmailed. Putin does what he does, very well.
Are you mourning the demise of your terrorist fanboys, puppet mccain?  Too bad.

First of all, I wish you well. Second, US has been supporting AQ / NUSRA groups.
VERY SIGNIFICANT!
Former Free Syrian Army leader (friend of US ex-ambassador @fordrs58 ) admits US directly aided AlQaeda with its program 
Sir you are one of the good Republicans
March 2015 & combat mission in Syria, the Harper government pushed through the House, is the biggest blunder ever
Putin, 2
Trump
IC nowayout

How many exit ramps have the GOP passed up?
Hey, Johnny, why didn't you went to Idlib for a little brain surgery by your precious rebels, like beheading?
Still have that twitchy trigger finger like you did on the deck of the USS Forrestal?  Retire "Songbird".  No one cares what you think.
Please go away with dignity and grace.
Don't forget his health care muddle, if approved will cost many Americans their lives.
Total lies most people kicked off will leave on their own accord since they won't have to pay the penalty anymore. Get your facts straight
Total nonsense. Anyone can walk into an emergency room and get care. Even illegals. The taxpayers pay the bill
Amazing how you always try to upstage and belittle our president. Swsmper and leaker u should look st yourself sir. He didn't sllow veterans
To die in AZ under his watch.
Thinking Russian president Trump cares or will ever do whats right for America is not going to happen. Only what Putin wants
Another ignorant response because they can't communicate with intelligent words, SMH
McCain, you're not a "hero." You're a hateful bigot who ruined the lives and careers of many LGBT soldiers. Your legacy is hate and shame!
Fcuk Usa fcuk YPG.idiot us army isis = YPG...turkish otannato soldiers killed by ypg
Fakenews of AlQaeda backer #Mccain
Nut Job! 
@SenJohnMcCain will always be remembered for hateful anti LGBT rhetoric, support for DOMA, and harm to LGBT soldiers and their families!

Thanks, Senator. I hope that you're not in pain and that you know how much love is being sent your way.

Wow. Even when diagnosed with brain cancer John McCain finds the time to issue a statement calling for regime change in Syria. Obama's hero! https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/888077917007339520 …
Senator McCain, ignore the vitriol from the Russian bots and alt right. Real Americans thank you for your service and wish you well.
Wishing you a speedy recover, sir. You are in my prayers.
Must watch #NotARevoloution @KevorkAlmassian
You need to speak out forcefully against POTUS

John, as a raging hateful homophobe, who supports DADT and DOMA, you have no credibility. HATE is your legacy!

How will you explain to someone in Phoenix that they will play 4x, 50% more, or 2x what hey pay under ACA @JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain? 
hope you're not ok with hurting our most vulnerable communities? #NoCutsToMedicaid #SaveOurCare #BCRAp #SinglePayer
These graphs make pretty clear that BCRA does NOT provide access to health care for those with low incomes: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/07/20/how-bcra-2-0-would-impact-enrollee-costs-according-to-your-age-and-income/ …
