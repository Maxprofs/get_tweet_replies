@SenJohnMcCain Please Vote NO on the #GrahamCassidyBill. It will be disastrous for all Americans. It's cruel.
And now from the world who cares this message..
Do the right thing. Vote No! on this horrible healthcare ill bill. Vote NO. Please.
McCain just lost MY support.  Morning joe sucks.  Pmsnbc is a wing of the demoncrat party.
Of course all your "friends" wanting to defeat the new REP bill are Democrats.  You know that of course?   DEMS are now swarming around you.

Sen. John McCain Backed Into a Corner, Refuses to Tell Authorities Where He Got 9 Million Dollars From… http://statefort.com/sen-john-mccain-backed-corner-refuses-tell-authorities-got-9-million-dollars/ …
  TRAITOR
Hope you stand strong about wanting normal order for health bill. There has been no CBO scores, no meetings, no hearings no public input
Vote No on Cassidy/Graham bill. Be brave & insist on normal order. We must find solutions together.  (Stay well too! Beat the cancer!)
I only want to hear you repealing Obamacare.
Please say no sen.
Here's another: You suck.
Vote no on Cassidy-Graham bill!
Senator McCain please vote NO on the Cass/Grahm bill. Be a hero for the people again.
Yes John, please torpedo your friends, comrades and the American people again.  Great to have that power!
Your last vote will mean nothing unless you vote no on this bill as well. It is just as bad as the last! Make it better not worse!
Please vote no!
Traitor
Here we go again...  No effort for bi-partisan healthcare bill.  We look to continued leadership from Senator McCain to do what's best.
Senator u must stay the course & defend healthcare 4 all!!! Do not vote with ur cruel & heartless crew. Please don't let this bill pass!!!
Save your pleasure because he'll be voting FOR Graham/Cassidy and we'll all get screwed on that one.
25 self congratulatory tweets about a mediocre program lasting 10 years consistently behind your competitors. You should be proud.
Yeah. Trump was right! He WAS wiretapped!!!!!
He needs to give his no vote message to the Senate and NOW!!!!!!
Hilarious.. but so true
RINO McCain attracts so many fawning liberals to his twitter feed.Do AZ GOP voters support this ancient relic because of his medical issues?
Did you call morning Joe fake but you won't  call out fox disappointed  I'm a dem but I had respect for you not now
Just like you today will deceive the American people along with the rest of the GOP if you vote yes to the Graham/Cassidy Bill. VOTE NO!


McCain sucks. He is going to be on the VIEW with those lame ass morons.
Please vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy Bill which will destroy healthcare for millions.  Don't let your legacy be one of moral cowardice.
How about the despicable attempt to remove our healthcare?
How can you support the substance of Graham-Cassidy? Have you even read it? Or did aides hand you an iPhone with a message from Lindsey?
Not impressed!!!
Maybe John should join your network. He fits in since he is a Never Trumper
He had brain surgery dam.
And they put a liberal brain in there yet small still liberal
Rino
Did it include a gift of committing to a NO vote on Graham Cassidy Trump bill?
Why are you, who are fighting cancer yourself, "ok" w/a bill denying other cancer patients ongoing treatment. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
We so appreciate your no vote on Trumpcare. Please follow up by opposing #GrahamCassidy .
Will my daughter be told that she has no healthcare soon? She has severe cerebral palsy and will die without her medicaid!
Hopefully @SenJohnMcCain will be our hero again. #VoteNo on #rushjob #killthebill. No CBO score no vote
Morning Woe*
Always willing to give interviews to your whacko bird friends. Afraid the conservative hosts would ask real questions? Just RETIRE Brutus
Pls vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill. If it passes, newborn babies w/ health issues will use up their benefits right away. They want to live.
President my ass. Go learn a trade and get a job
while you're getting treatment for your illness John, think about those who won't have that opportunity if you vote w/ your buddy Graham


@SenJohnMcCain  B4 U VOTE.. Pls ask Trump about 'Oscar'.. Kushner's private insurance project that will earn Trumpster's millions.. ASK..

Why no tweets about your support for the Graham-Cassidy bill?
Your vote on G-C will be your legacy. After 40 years of public service, do you want to be remembered for destroying so many lives? SAVE ACA.
He is not the one & only. We have other such RINOs equally bad as McCain. No wonder democrats like this traitor. He's a democrat.
Please tell us you are not now denigrating a reputable member of our free press the same way as @Potus does.
And why would you base your vote on the new HC bill on a Governor rather than the majority of the people that have told you what they want?
The first step in destroying our Democratic Republic is to destroy our Free Press, by attempting to discredit them. Like @POTUS is doing!
Don't be a #TrumpToady.  Save your legacy by standing up to him!  Remember when you were a hero?
Many believe you are a coward for not appearing on the show and debating Joe. Instead, you post insulting quips! Apologize 4 your remarks!
John is sometimes a hero and sometimes just a political hack.  Depending on which way the wind blows.  Or what the Governor says!
Really John McCain, Really? You must vote NO!
Sixteen Patient and Provider Groups Oppose Graham/Cassidy Bill http://www.lung.org/about-us/media/press-releases/sixteen-patient-and-provider-groups-oppose-graham-cassidy-bill.html …

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans.

Hey morning joke, are you going to cover the wire taps this morning?  You know the ones you spent countless hours on calling Trump a liar.
Mc Cain the traitorous ROMP. How appropriate he's on PMSLSD
McCain should be a paid consultant for the wacko group..God knows the flaky senator from AZ fits in the circle jerk like hand in glove..
I am assuming this was mostly tongue in cheek?
