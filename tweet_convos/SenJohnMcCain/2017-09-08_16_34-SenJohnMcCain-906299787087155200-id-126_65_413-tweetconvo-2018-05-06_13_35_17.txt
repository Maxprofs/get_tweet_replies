But not proud enough to help Arizona with health care, so sad. Guess you don't care about us!
John you are all talk and do not support our @POTUS. U've betrayed your constitruents in AZ when they needed u most to resolve ACA high cost
not so proud of your contributions to national security.
@MDHelicopters can you just stay there.  We really need you out of our way.  You've done enough for yourself.
Mexico will pay for the impeachment. Bye @realDonaldTrump
yes we Arizonans do contribute. Too bad both our senators are against our potus and are worthless.
don't forget to thank POTUS for bringing jobs back to USA!!
Traitor you must retire!
Besides term limits, need to put age limits also. His old ass should retire already. Enjoy the few years he has left without being a puppet.
This is how the state of Arizona feels about you #RINO
Please resign! You are no hero! #MAGA
Of course you are, you love some NWO shit.
Retire now traitor!
As a man I have great respect for you, but.....go lions
Shame ur not concerned about AZ border security. But hey ur locked in u will be a Senator 4 ever. No matter how shitty u r at ur job.

We need the wall built to keep drugs and aliens out. Oh that's right your the no vote for Soros and democrats. A true veteran would vote GOP
How's that Russian dossier coming along, John? 
Coming up with anything that will stick yet?

At least Arizona has that to be proud of - certainly can't crow about their Senators.
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMERICA 1ST AGENDA!
Come on John.
I am so glad that you never gave up.




commiserations on the loss of your comrade
ISIS ‘Deir ez-Zor emir’ killed by Russian airstrike in #Syria was linked to 2015 Paris attacks https://on.rt.com/8min  
How much did you get in kick-backs????
McCain ...what a sad end for this sick man! He should step down immediately...his family should have an intervention!He has become senile!

If only their confused Senator, you, would just retire. Your work as a democrat won't be forgotten
Привет Джон! Как твой рак? Поддал ему пинков??? Hi John! How's your cancer? Struck him and kicks?
Hope they aren't counting on ObamaCare
You announced your retirement! #MAGA #draintheswamp #mcainmustgo

@MDHelicopters
The crap that comes out of your mouth, @ChuckGrassley @SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC @SenateMajLdr to name a few is shameful. Pathetic. UN
Why are we doing this?
JUST IN: US stops surveillance of ISIS convoy at request of Russia http://hill.cm/0z1BWL6  
You haven't resigned yet? What are you waiting for?
Your delusional to say the least
RETIRE 
Thanks Cindy
Are you now procuring helicopters for your Nazi allies or your radical islamic monster friends?
Nice job McCain voting against Hurricane Harvey relief funding. Shame on you!
Term limits
How about a border wall?
Go to sleep and think  who gave you the nine million and tell the American people what a crook you really are

JOHN MCCAIN SHOULD RETIRE AND RELAX. WE DONT NEED YOU JOHN.MAKE WAY FOR TODAY'S YOUTH.WE'LL MANAGE. GO FISHING.
I'm sure you're getting a piece of the action. Everyone knows you wouldn't support it unless you were getting money for it
I was hoping the great news was you retiring. AZ deserves better representation than a liar traitor
I'm proud of our state too with the exception of two things:
POTUS providing jobs.

But not relief for hurricane victims.

@MDHelicopters go away
Where's your border wall?
You sound like Schumer, Pelosi, Durbin, Waters, Sanders...oh that's right, ur a Democrat.
But you're allowing our major cities, one by one, to declare themselves sanctuary. How can you proclaim anything national security?
How did they vote u in then ? Ur a criminal admit it
WHO PADS YOUR POCKETS?  GEORGE SOROS, YOU DIRTY POS!
Too bad you're the biggest detriment to our security @SenJohnMcCain Decades of inaction on strengthening borders...#retiremccain
Please be an American hero, patriot – remove treasonous lying racist putin puppets now
You're a Lib wussy

Really, that's your priority right now?
Great news would be you and Frosted Flake are no longer senators.
You didn't do any thing how much do you get
So you voted against relief for hurricane victims
Voting against hurricane relief. Everytime I think you can get no lower you prove me wrong. RETIRE Brutus
