Now would be a good time to desert GOP.
He is a Democrat ... as so many other establishment republicans. What are they - statists, fascists ... more accurately, I suppose, cronies.
He is a Democrat in Republican clothing. Yet; I will pray for this man who bravely served his Country during Vietnam.
And I'll pray for you for being so naive/ignorant. #FakeAccount
Thank you for your prayers.  @VP

What a beautiful family. God bless you all.
My family and I are praying for you McCain!
Residents of AZ have the highest healthcare premiums, @SenJohnMcCain should be ashamed of himself! His vote was costly to the folks of AZ!!!
He is no hero, real hero's support their home state ! AZ and USA  is suffering from @SenJohnMcCain's healthcare vote 2 weeks ago! Very sad
Have fun
Great pic!
#CindyMcCain is a Gorgeous #GMILF
Like @SenJohnMcCain wrote any of "his" Afghan plan. How about some think tank supported by the military  industial complex. AND OF COURSE
Tell @SenJohnMcCain to save us from Trump!
Enjoy your day Senator.  Thank you again for your no vote
Meghan tell your father to rally the #GOP and kick the madman out of the White House before he gets us all killed. #TrumpSoStupid
I too am fighting cancer so keep up the good work we need you.
Go Dodgers...sorry, I could not help it. God bless John McCain!
Love John mccain..good man. True patriot
Hoping the family is resting and John heals soon..
Hope John is eating right and getting some rest too *)
Love you, @SenJohnMcCain. Praying for you. Thank you for your service.
Enjoying a ballgame while we're stuck paying for Obamacare? NICE!
Looking good
Yaa
Our prayers are with you and your family, we need John now more than evet....
IDEA.... spend more time with your family and get well in retirement.
Boy isn't that the truth. But he won't.He's too evil and sick with hate. Hate and power and money is what drives him and a lot of the others
Wish you well. Glad to see you out and about.  Go Blue.
Does you family have #ObamaCare?
Beautiful picture!
Looking good Senator, happy to see you out & about. #AmericanHero
How many times did you have to remind him that he was at a ball game and that, no, he can't eat his hat.
That American hero has brain cancer.  Are you just testing to see if Karma is real?
My gut feeling is that John is fine and serves another 8 years then retires & you get some time to spend with him.
It is humbling to see life from a different lens. You helped many more families enjoy such moments together by voting no on healthcare bill

Tell your husband he must retire! He's detrimental to our country!  He is a traitor
Senator McCain's thank you video makes me sad. He's loved and appreciated.
Do your job and repeal Obamacare. This is what the country needs and you know it.
I've never had a reason to go to Arizona. I thought it was the kidnapping capital of the US. #Medium cc. @PattyArquette
those Navy guys are always around beautiful women......
Senator John McCain is a great man
I am proud of John recognizing that cancer patients need insurance that covers preexisting and no lifetime cap. Thank you John.
So glad to see you all together. Keep up the fight Sen McCain. But...sorry...GO Rockies! 
Great pic Senator.
God Bless you and God Bless America

Good looking family in a great state.
Hope your Dad gets well soon DEMS need him back.
Hang in there senator wishing you many many healthy days. You are a true hero. Thank you sir.
Bullshit. Do your research. He has lied and been a traitor most of his life.
Yeah yeah we saw you with your traitor father yesterday. I wouldn't hang out with my dad if he dumped my crippled mom
Thanks for the fun photo Cindy. Can you please ask @SenJohnMcCain to step down from the Senate?Arizona is hurting by insurance prices.
"@SenJohnMcCain: RT @cindymccain: Fun with @SenJohnMcCain @MeghanMcCain @Dbacks "
Take your husband shopping, forever!
He's a dinosaur and needs to retire. Take this opportunity to get out with his remaining dignity.
#MAGA
Sending love from Tempe

Well wishes to the McCains!
@LouiseMensch @SenJohnMcCain @MeghanMcCain @Dbacks God bless senator MCCain  for voting no on that healthcare bill
Nice picture
John is a piece of 
You all look so good! Thank you for sharing this
You uh...you know HC costs were rising faster /before/ ACA, right?
You are a fraud. You lied to the American people. You should be ashamed.
You all can have fun spending money to go to a game. I have to figure how I am going to pay for obamacare. Thanks John.
So good to see you, @SenJohnMcCain ! Very best wishes to you and your family
Your husband is a traitor. Selling weapons to Isis and walking from Obamacare discussion. Despicable!
He looks great!!!
Much love and respect. I'm not of the same political party, but I know of a dear life the senator touched in his strong way. Never forget.
Perfect
I wish & pray, Senator gets well soon. Every instance is a message, you take it or not :-)

@LouiseMensch @SenJohnMcCain @MeghanMcCain  Senator, thanks for saving my healthcare and sticking it to Trump at the same time.
God bless you John!
Hey well soon John 
Hey there @SenJohnMcCain  TY again for #ProtectOurCare #ProtectOurDemocracy @Shareblue @maddow @dailykos @womensmarch @UniteWomenOrg
Sending healing best wishes your way @SenJohnMcCain !! Glad you're enjoying some summer fun!! 
That bastard lied to every American when he campaigned on repealing obamacare. He can burn in hell. I have to live with it, he doesn't.
Go Dodgers!
Have fun!
Wishing you all the best ! You're a HERO Sen McCain. Although disagree on policy at times, you have my utmost respect & TY for your service
Perfectly said
I still have found memories of spend a part of an afternoon with you and the Senator in Seattle back in 99. My prayers are with the family
#PrayersUp for you all!! Thank you Senator for your service . #TruePatriot
Beat LA!!
Good to see you out and enjoying some time with your family.  Hope all is well.  Godspeed.
I support the Senator's efforts to bring back a more formal dress code to our national pastime  
Why did you condemn us to ACA?  $1648/month for lousy bronze plan with $13,000 deductible!  You can afford it.  Not us!
Get better fast Sir. Democracy and diplomacy need you  ps. So happy to see you enjoying yourself your family 
John, I love you and pray for yr quick recovery...May God you enjoy the joy of yr family! Amen.
How is yr mother, sir?
I'll save any political statements for another day. Here we just see a #hero, an #antisextrafficinghero and a #daughteroftwoheros.
A liar and fraud who campaigned on repealing obamacare and then refused when he had the chance. He can burn as far as I'm concerned.
Three horrible people.
Great family pic!
This looks awesome. this is a true hero right there not like you know who.
True hero? Try liar and a fraud.
Praying daily for the family and the Captain's health. Warm Regards, Retired Navy Chief
Woo hoo! Love that pic. Shows sprit, love and bravery.
God Bless the McCains'
Thank you again for your vote recently. You might not realize what a great thing it was that you did... Well maybe you do.I will not 4 get
God bless... wishing you all the best...
