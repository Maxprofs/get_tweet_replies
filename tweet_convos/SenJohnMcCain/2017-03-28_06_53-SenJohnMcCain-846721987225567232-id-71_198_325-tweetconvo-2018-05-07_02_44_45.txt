can you by bass a congressional hearing and have a senate hearing?
please vote for an independent committee to investigate the White House espionage
Nunes must resign
you watch to much CNN! Didnt Hillary Clinton and John pedosta write their own emails? Or was it Russia?
#compromised #sociopath #McCain
This is why an Independent Commission is needed. PLEASE call for one!  We are begging you!
It's YOUR PARTY supporting Putin here in the US. Where do you stand?
u talk about Nunez ? Bipartisan? U certainly aren't! U clearly have an agenda.U r the poster child for term limits
when are you going to stand up and lead the resistance to obtain trumps tax returns
find the truth.
Do you want another color revolution? Do you support a color revolution against your Saudi Arabian sponsors?
putin has a puppet in WH and you are not doing anything? Everything else means nothing. We demand action..
why do you interfere in Russia' internal affairs? You seem to want a war with Russia. Off politics ;you are senile.
#isREALY more #terroristJewsAndTheirFakeNews. #proxy #HeadLines @netanyahu #ChickenShit @WarrenBuffett @HarveyWeinstein
I like the backfiring and acid humour. Why is this not classified as hate speech?? OH its only Dems and they can kill
Pls Senator w prob Russian infltration in Exec & Legis branches-call for total stop of nominatons except Intel hearings.
@trumpworldnews @WSJ That's NOT GOOD That's NO GOOD
yet our government continues to protect PUTIN in anyway. NUNES & what's in it for @SpeakerRyan ? This is  embarrassment 2 USA
And has the "president" commented?
Trump's not the "president". He's the President. You can't deny reality
The only way to investigate Russian interference properly is to quit the GOP with 2 others and organize with Dems.
The GOP is incapable of investigating their Dear Leader. You must join Dems for the sake of America.
This stuff is all small potatoes compared to Russia's installation of a sympathetic fool in the White House.
Has Navalny been released yet? #WhereIsAlexeiNavalny
#InsaneMcCain loves to defend #GeorgeSoros NGOs. Do you support them in the USA against our Present? #MAGA #MEGA #EndEU
In 1974, the GOP lost 49 House and 8 Senate seats.

They were branded as defended a corrupt, criminal Presidency
DO YOUR JOB. How is it legal/ethical for @IvankaTrump to get security clearance and serve as advisor to @POTUS?
senator as a fello combat veteran what is being done by the senate to stop this traitor in the whitehouse?
Where is the WH on this blasting Putin & his oppressive regime!  Time to get him off the "buddy" list!
lie, steal and have sex with minors and babies and think they are not going to be held accountable. I have news for you
Hey John.. tell us more about Saudi contributions to McCain Institute .. and the quid pro quo sale of AZ land to Saudis
This is terrible. Putin is again showing he is more dictator than Pre.
Nunes must resign
How about taking care of business at home, you're not the secretary of state.
My father did not fight in WWII so we could witness an asymmetrical takeover of the USA by Russia.
- Do you think Russia protests will influence Putin's aggressiveness in Ukraine or other areas?

This is America John, remember?
Navalny is one brave, crazy man. You should urge people 2 watch his full video re Medvedev&Corruption. It has subtitles!
Hahaha. Navalny IS the Putin's man...
Most likely not see the light of day again
We must fight for his freedom. Thank you Sen McCain
@navalny he will overcome, he will rise. Why doesn't our president comment? Does he seek the same here?
The man #putin hates most:
#AlexeiNavalny 
The man russian people loves most:
#AlexeiNavalny
So brave! I pray he stays in the public eye. May be the one thing that keeps him alive.
convert to globalist dem already you old nut
What about the 1000 foot crater 7000 ft deep you approved in arizona for copper mining on native land!!
maybe soon we'll have that kind of leadership, where dissent = jail. We're right on schedule, with Putin's guidance.
my question to you sir.do you want us at war with Russia?? Because..we all live on this rock called  earth! Our only home
we should look into how McCain would profit from war with Russia.
Господин сенатор, заберите его к себе!Пожалуйста!
Moderate rebels anyone... :(
.@SenJohnMcCain @ClaraJeffery @WSJ 

He's still alive.
Ergo, he is not the man Putin hates most.
Must-read @WSJ: "The Man #Putin Hates Most: #AlexeiNavalny gets another jail term amid opposition protests" https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-putin-hates-most-1490656418 …
Putin knows a dead Navalny would be worse for him because he has such a large following.
When will we really investigate the White House and ALL the Putin ties
Putin is NOT who we want to do business with... he's evil
