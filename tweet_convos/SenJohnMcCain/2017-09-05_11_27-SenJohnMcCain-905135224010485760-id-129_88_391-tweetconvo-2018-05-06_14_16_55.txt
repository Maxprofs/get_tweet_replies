Why is the fed paying for an obvious local issue. Phoenix should be paying for this not everyone in the US. @SenJohnMcCain
Read.   The.   Bill.
Read. The. Constitution.
Again, READ.   THE.  BILL.  I have pictures of you NEED THEM
Obviously, reading, spelling and grammar are not your strengths.
I have to know, why do you feel it necessary to criticize someone who is just trying to inform and have a discussion? #unnecessary
It was bc the way I interpreted the "READ. THE. BILL."  It came across as like a parent talking to a child. Didn't appreciate the tone.
So you countered it with the same Behaviour? I see.
Why would it cost over $5 million to hire 32 firefighters?!
You're kidding me right? This isn't even a years worth of operating costs for 32 firefighters...#facts
Same with teachers and police officers.
Three completely different comp structures - can't compare. Possibly compare police to fire, but still different structures
Then support our president @realDonaldTrump & ending Obama's unconstitutional  DACA order restores Congress' authority on immigration
So important especially for this desert region of the US.
Have congressman work part time as firefighters, then at least we'd be getting some value for our tax dollars
Are you kidding...5.3 million is all the great McCain can up with...your losing it John.  Thought you were the great master. Lol NOT
How much of the lobbyists money made it to your pockets ???
WTH?  $165,625 per fire fighter?  That's an awful lot of federal money for firefighters in Arizona.  Shouldn't AZ being paying firemen?
$5.3 million divided by 32 = $165,625 per firemen. What kind of government waste is this!!!! No wonder the nation runs massive deficits!!!
Looks like pork to me and growing government. McCain never met a dollar in your pocket that he didn't want to spend
as I know, you are a great political person, why do not you raise sound of justice to innocent people of Burma that being killed cruelly
Will they have HealthCare? We know you don't want Healthcare for Americans.
Shouldn't the people of Phoenix pay for them? Seems pretty fair to me.
How about you showing same enthusiasm to repeal and replace Obamacare
must my ass#johnthumbsdownmccain 
Is it borrowed money from establishment or foreign countries against children's future
How about you just retire already?
Virginia has massive vacancy rates for state police. We need immigrants. They are doctors, nurses, police, scientists, and soldiers.
Congress should pass a bill to bring all to book that started the wars in the MIDDLE EAST and those that created ISIS…
Why in God's name if federal government paying local government employees' salaries? Pay for your own damned firefighters Phoenix.

What's attached to it!




Sounds like Phoenix needs to increase revenue and get rid of wasteful spending. Can Dems actually balance a budget?
I agree!
Why should Congress do anything for you. You been around to long. You did not support the POTUS or Congress when it came time.
When the grant runs out? The tax payers will be on the hook for the benefits, retirement ect.. short term solution to make you look good.
Hey dummy. Big Govt is what Dems do. Change party and spew this crap.
Ask senators you betrayed to help you
VOTE AGAINST JOHN MCCAIN. HE SCREWED AMERICANS BY VOTING AGAINST MOVING FOWARD ON HEALTHCARE. FIRST VOTE ON HEALTHCARE JOHN.
How much is a firefighters salary? I'm seeing this is 165k per fighter
You sir are a traitor to this country and now everyone knows it. @realDonaldTrump will have my vote again in 2020
Your math is wrong that will only hire two!
OBAMACARE REPEAL BILL which you personally tanked was bill that would given relief to middle class Americans!
IMPEACH TRUMP
WHY does congress have to pass "Your" bill when you personally made it impossible for congress to pass Repeal bill?
Oink oink oink!! I smell pork!!!
Cruelty to Cruelty. DACA or no hurricane relief spending. Looks fair to me. DACA AMERICANS ARE NOT PAWNS FOR WALL FUNDING!
Jeez, I hope this wasn't a bribe! We are correct in having become suspicious. This is from Dept. of Homeland Security. IMMIGRATION/BORDER.
Sure that's fu_king trump country!
Saw more of your BS on TV this past week with your buddies the guy from SC does he still sleep with his sister?
More Federal money that we can't afford this is a state and a city issue
Is Phoenix a sanctuary city? Hope not. Would you lose future grants if they are?
Traitor
Pass the ex-lax, get them all on regular order, you'll be a centurion instead of a contrarian octarian. RETIRE Brutus.
We've had enough, sir, with all due respect.
How about talking to friends in state house. The new tier 3 firefighters are going to be in 70's when they retire. Think about that rescue.
You sure do have a big mouth to bad your words mean crap anymore . Step down John
Miss your state ( coming in soon UN Beef Certified not the 1st 50 cent lol global bit money email( Vbhc money to post) btw
Nothing for you @SenJohnMcCain aka songbird
Since 2010, rich Arizona has received $43,504,713 from Homeland Security (tax dollars) to pay for Phoenix firefighters? GOP tax cuts my ass.
Arizona should get nothing until you resign
Tick Tock John...
How is it the fed's job to pay for firefighters in Phx??  How about you just let Phx keep their tax money and hire them themselves?!  PORK!
MOCs have a lot of work to do... bipartisan healthcare @saveDACA @DebtCeiling @savePuertoRico @Impeach_D_Trump
Is this sustainable for Phoenix after the grant?
@SenJohnMcCain YOU are our HERO! Thank U 4 all you do for us Dems & GOPS. You have a huge heart. You are courageous. We love & appreciate U!
Sounds like a state or a city problem.
Unless of course you use it as blackmail 4 votes

Sounds like a local issue. Just more pork for the nation to carry.
When are you going to be questioned by mueller about dossier ??
You should be President! We need more firefighter's everywhere, they don't hire new firefighters in CA.
We would be more encouraged if you would just retire
Has everyone ever seen a politician like mccain .. corrupt as they come !!!
is it really the federal govt's job to hire firefighters for az?
wow, really? who do you think pays for the services of the police, firefighters?
Senator Congress has alot of things that need to be done but with Trump leading your party you are so screwed. Congress should stay on vacat
well it appears that Ms. Sarah & @realDonaldTrump think you have more important thing to do. he says,  you have 6months on this one.
What did you do to try to prevent the destruction of DACA?
Great news. Now McCain Do Your Job Save DACA or resign.
Okay sounds great. Am all for the Fire Fighters! But....The must pass a Bill to Keep DACA also. Thank you Senator McCain. ;) Be Well.
Probably hid it in the #HarveyRelief bill along with Debt ceiling and Cont. Resolution
Why don't u pass our bill? Repeal replace
Oh now YOU want something from us!?
North Idaho that's not clouds that smoke
There is no word about rohingyas human
 Look familiar? @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN @SenJohnMcCain @BreitbartNews
Costsso no tax cuts if you want services right @VP & @SenateMajLdr No tax revenue = nofor services @SenJohnMcCain @KTAR923 @SenateFinance
You have been an Obstructionist to Trump at every turn! Please step aside!
5.3 million split up 32 ways?
It's a very simple question big mouth who gave you the nine million you can answer  George Soros gave you the 9 million
Sorry.  Congress is too busy supporting a President who wants to kick people out of the country because of the color of their skin.
You need to retire.
. Traitor johnny, there is a place for you, they just haven't dug it yet.
I want vote for a damn thing you want mr. McCain
Maybe you could give them some of them 9 million that you don't want to talk about where you got it
Amazing. How an 81 year old man with brain cancer who hates computers can be so proficient utilizing Twitter all of a sudden. Megan? That U?
Megan is a scumbag as well, we need to vote these Rhinos out before we dont have a country anymore
Please be our hero – save our democracy. Kenya nullified Election Cambridge Analytica -remove racist, lying, treasonous putin puppets now
I believe we need affordable healthcare you Democrat
Maybe you should also come up your to North Idaho
Stop the racist policies. U are the only true hero left there.
You better worry what happens in London and keep your mouth shut to you Europeans he's a hero but to us he's a traitor
I was going to offer a trade McCain for somebody over there but there's nobody over there worth anything
At least he has the b***ls to stand up to racism and unfair policies. More than can be said about POTUS.
Still better than being in a racist bigoted country. And I have lived in London and I have lived in US. CHOOSE LONDON ANYDAY.
, thank God for that probably couldn't make it in the US please stay there
I truly won't be. Always had a dislike for racist idiots. Was born and brought up the right way.
Start the impeachment. Now. Sir. While we still have a bit of America left... Hurry

Blindsided? You turned on Trump & disrespected your voters-what do you think will happen?
