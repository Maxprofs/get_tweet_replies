Your Pa is not around forever - Thats all I will say, Respects, Luv

I am giving up my GOP card...thanks to McCain who sided with the Democrats. Going independent. Trump should take away the exemption.
He didn't side w/ Dems. He chose the American people. ALL of us. This is the problem. U prefer sides, Reps vs Dems, over what's best 4 all.
When you campaign for 7 years on repealing ObamaCare and you are elected on that issue, you are not working for the people.
Semator U need to cross party lines and get support to stop the idiocy of this administration to continue.  I pray for you health 2 improve
@SenJohnMcCain is such a flip flop politician his agenda is to line his pocket and fill his wallet from the insurance companies
Shame. No evidence r/t your statement. It takes courage to follow your heart
Why?
NO LIAR

I'd rather listen to nails on a chalkboard, so no.
@MeghanMcCain you look so amazing and great and so do you Mr. Maverick McCain :)!
Hope u get better but please do do us all a favor retire and not return to Washington DC ...u r a part of the swamp we need to drain sir
With McCain it should be called the Bonehead show.

Even Meghan thinks you're a senile, self-serving jacka$$

You look great Senator!! Another thank you for your No healthcare vote!
Personally and politically, keep fighting. You are the 'elder statesman' and you're badly needed.
You are Unfit - Resign
I wish you all the best @SenJohnMcCain.  I'm glad you don't have my crappy insurance.  You should be glad too.
Meghan! You look... fantastic!
Nope. You dont listen to me. Im not listening to you. Talk ti the hand 


Can u just give us a nice little khux and take over the WH pleeeeeeze??
Yeah! Nuclear war would be fun! Let's do it!
"On the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."  For JM and MM--athiests.
THANKS FOR STOPING OBAMACARE...PROMISE KEEPER.
Thinking of you, Senator. Sending prayers and good wishes as you undergo your treatments. Meghan, take care of yourself too.

Thanks for sharing, Sen McCain.
I wonder, if McCein will turn to 81?
beautiful..  Meghan.. not you.. 
You two are beginning to look like the Goldmans. Go no where without each other.
Sen. McCain, thank you...know you and your family are in our daily prayers! Get strong again and get back to D.C!
Retire before you are shamefully recalled
You did the right thing, McCain. Seeing you in a whole new light. Much love

our tax dollars are paying for elected politicians to make media appearances & interviews instead of working to help American ppl. Disgrace
STROKE, STROKE, STROKE!
