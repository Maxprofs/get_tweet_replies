I watched while you were blowing the democrats
My back door was so amazing. I have seen 1 other in 1979. Pure blessing. Ty for a your Photo

@SenJohnMcCain is a democratic puppet, sellout, fraud, RINO, phony, fake!
From inside

We watched eckipse at Lake Louise in Toccoa, Georgia, with daughter Lenea  Martel she is elem. sch. teacher there.  Hershel Lewellyn, Jr.
From our patio in Yucaipa, CA.  So glad to have this memory.
Watched in bullhead city. By the way call jimmy carter he will give you great health advice
Fantastic!
I was busy working....and your staff that taxpayers pay for should have been doing the same
Seriously? Something that will not happen in our life again, would be aweful to not be part. Jealousy sucks don't it wow will pray for you.
York Nebraska - a bit overcast but still well worth the 590 mile drive from Dallas TX.
Nice shot man!
Senator McCain, do you think God will open the gates for you after all you've done to take him out of our country? You still have time
.@realDonaldTrump Gee John, We could not watch, we were working over time to pay for Obama Care that YOU VOTED TO KEEP. RESIGN JOHN RESIGN
That's a terrible phone photo, like you're a terrible RINO senator.
I was looking at how much the ACA was costing me.
from Houston, TX!   I used two paper plates with a pinhole in the top plate.   I observed 2/3 eclipse from my location, so cool!
Thank you for standing up for our healthcare!

U think the propaganda media supports you? They want the Rep Traitor  to say negitives. They don't like u, you are their Benedict Arnold!
You still have a staff?
Watched from a 80 yr old bridge over the Rancocas Creek in NJ with my son Tommy, a Boy Scout. Bridge to be demolished soon
Most Cool!
Can't pass health care bill, but plenty of time to watch an Eclipse. Tax money well spent
Maybe if they had a decent bill to pass they would have.
Well if they spent more time helping instead of political posturing. They would have one. They are supposed to be working together.
In Congress .....they were all sleeping ?!
In Mass so we didn't see much but it was great to just be outside watching and I followed the @NASA coverage. How are you ?
This is a GREAT pic of yesterday's eclipse
We watched from Conn, not as good!
Mt. Lassen State Park, 88% but very cool
Bless u John McCain 
CT - 75 percent. It was another one of the daily miracles of science!  We are praying for you and counting on ANOTHER win for the sciences!
That's it there in the lens flare next to The Statue of Freedom. That's about how I saw it here in TN with two pairs of sunglasses.
I forgot my welding helmet at the barn. Very unfortunate.

I watched from my backyard in Walnut Creek Ca. 20 miles east of San Francisco Bay. Heavy fog it just got really dark for about 1.5 hours.
I didn't. Some of us have jobs where have to actually, you know, do work.
It was actually Trumps ego blacking out the sky- "that to bad" political rivalry over sailors lives!  He is not worthy of his office! U R!
My driveway in PA!
America  is great in faith of God
I watched Trump staring into the sun w/out glasses #SolarEclispe2017 #DumpTrump #trumpisblind
I watched w/my neighbors at the pool at my apartment bldg. We could stand in the shade under the terrace roof-but it was still HOT!
