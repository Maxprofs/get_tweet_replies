Senator McCain we need boots on ground to lift Puerto Rico displaced up as they try to rebuild. TRUMP failed. You represent decent republicans so I implore you to help locals like @Vanessa1971 whose nephew died of bacteria from Maria? Allow them to VOTE!
THANKU Senator, please take corner under your wing and kick some ass for america
It was passed in WW1 to defend against foreign vessels coming to port.  Situation no longer applies.
Why? You, McCain are voting against even such things that you previously published ads about. You need to ho.
Or explain how improper it is for McConnell to work to keep the Jones Act a conflict due to James Chao. Or explain to Wilbur Ross or or or
Basspro Tell McConnell himself @SenMajLdr
Well @gmp_01 I would tell all those things and so much more to McConnell @SenMajLdr but he's Republican Trash; aka  Thieves.....
So? Stand up for your rights & still tell them.  Call 202-224-3121 or use this handy littke gadget
I do tell them and anyone else that will listen, sadly most don't care.
Don't give up! Psyches have proven repeated comments eventually embed in subconscious.  Why do u think Trump repeats stuff 100 times?
He's 71 and bigly Illiterate 
Does this mean neighbors & friends like Mexico can no longer deliver supplies & halts all international aide to #PuertoRico
You have done enough damage. You are a bitter, disappointed man who did not keep his word or support his party.
Annette/russian bot, I'm not even Republican but S. T. F. U.  Show some respect....
Just join the democratic party and be done with it McCain. You're such a liberal and a childish, jealous old fool.
McCain, keep fighting...your country needs you, desperately.  Hold the line.  Thank you for your service.
Yes!!!  Jones Act must be waived until the people suffering in Puerto Rico have everything they need!!!
16 people died........ the media fed a load of BS.......AS USUAL.
Nope. Many more are dead now and the number keeps rising. Check out this Vet on FB
He’s on the ground and saving lives with a few of his friends.
I thank him for his service.... the zero mccain needs to go.
"MAVERICK"
Yes
The temp lift of #JonesAct did nothing, no other carriers req to dock, no change in traffic, prob is inside PR
Exactly right. Plus PR gets 60% of cargo from foreign Flag vessels anyway.
Correct
We don’t need your input John. You’ve done enough damage.
Bit say what
Congress must pass nothing that you have proposed
Every tool available to aid in the recovery in a timely manner needs to be used.  There is no good reason to continue this outdated law.
Thank you for all you do to save our country by putting it above your political party. You will always be a hero for it.
Thank you for looking out for Puerto Rico!! God bless you @SenJohnMcCain !!!!
Thank You For All that you Do!!!!
I hope ELITIST @DNC  =on board with this vital+urgent bill 2 save AMERICAN LIVES! PLEASE do something ABOVE the demands of your DONOR OWNERS
Yes please. What a grand achievment would be to free my people of this 97 years injustice. Gospeed
Please & Thank you
PLZ GET WELL SOON!
WE NEED YOU TO SAVE OUR COUNTRY FROM HIM AND HIS CORRUPT ADMIN. I AGREE WITH CORKER WE HAVE A TODDLER WITH OUR NUKE CODES
Or you could vote for a better healthcare system our country
Please retire John
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4qcK88zcX0 …  please watch Sir
congress should never do anything you say traitor.......you are satan....glioblastomas take about 2 yrs..
You want people to support and pass your bill but you don't support anyone but Schummer but yes it needs passing.
You just love attention don't you? If not for you would Congress already have in conference (aka regular order) an #Obamacare repeal. #ego
Sure, and most Americans did not support Trumpcare. The Senator represented his constituents well with that vote.
No he did not. Premiums in AZ through the roof. McCain put personal pettiness over sending bill to conference. while he has platinum care
Premiums are up bc of Republican sabotage of the ACA. Insurance execs, health pros, & the CBO agree that the Rep tax cut bill was a disaster
Thank you Adam
You're quite welcome, and thank you.
the only thing Mccain needs to pass in his place in our goverenment to someone who is capable. step down John
Co-sponsor a bill, & get it on the floor!
It’s mind boggling how representatives of the GOP grow a conscience when they are no longer dependent on GOP$$$!!!
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain !
You should have passed the health bill dumb a#*
Really, now you want Congress to back you? Get lost
Senator, any chance you'll change parties? The GOP is hell bent on destroying itself. I believe that you are putting country over party now.
John retire. U r not a true American
Love you guys!! God bless you and keep helping my island!!
Senator, Thank you for helping the people of Puerto Rico. .@realDonaldTrump & .@FEMA_Brock 's behavior has been inhumane.  #PuertoRicoRelief
Puerto Rican diaspora is with you, Sen. McCain.
Let’s get this done!! Let’s get this do-nothing administration to accomplish something positive for the citizens!!!
Considering #Trumps recent meeting with Kissinger, I'd say the people are F'd
rather see pallets of supplies dropped by air force 24 7 till no one in america is starving
Pleaaaaaaseeeee Senator keep up the fight!
Don’t forget about Hawaii.
Why not include Hawaii and all territories as well?
Thanks John McCain.
I work in a transportation Co, and we were not able to use the waive of the Jones Act. Without communication there is nothing we can do!
Yes please Senator McCain lead the charge !
Congress is doing nothing, just like @realdonaldtrump.
Worry about your illness enjoy your family while you can we really don't need your opinion.
Thank you, Sen. McCain. I don't always agree with you, but I strongly agree on this.
Was thinking maybe someone could get PR some food, water, and electricity, like TODAY!!!!
This is from a seasoned disaster military coordinator Get help to #PuertoRico before malaria, etc
The Jones Act has killed the economy of Puerto Rico it's an outdated law from the 1900's. #PuertoRico  #JonesAct
Thank you Senator.
Thank you, Senator. This is personal for me and I appreciate your help. Puerto Rico deserves better than this president. We all do. 
God Bless You Sir for your courage & conviction, as you stand in the gap for Th American people, during this tyranical terror we are facing!
Repeal and replace
How 'bout Congress starts Impeachment proceedings against the "moron" who let it expire? #ImpeachTrumpPenceNOW #ImpeachThemALL #Resist
Why is this a battle!!??
Please keep fighting for the right things !!

HERO.
Congress can’t even send aid to save more American lives in Puerto Rico & USVI! Genocide is on our governments hands!
@realDonaldTrump #Cult45 is giving you credit for waiving #JonesAct but you only did that temporarily. Do you support this Bill?
God bless you.
You NEED to speak out a lot more. You NEED to speak out like Corker. You suffered torture & now going to die so why be so afraid of trump???
If it doesn't pass I will be furious
John,
 Desolez. That my mother's uncle fought on normandie.  Not me.
Oh yeah...what's the weasels name? Graham? golfed with him yesterday!! I'm German and  I'm talking oohh.. well kinda like the 1930s Germany
Senator!! I am thinkin all reason is lost on him!!!
Please also do something about #CHIP & #DreamAct !  Oh, and tell the House of Reps to impeach Trump before he starts war with North Korea.
@HomefrontHugs Yes
Where do we sign up?
And also get real help to Puerto Rico. They're dying.  Food, water, medical supplies.
Can you put #CHIP on there, too, pal?
I hear the train a coming . Its coming around the bin .
Way to go Sen. McCain!!
Get it done!
Yes, thank you @SenJohnMcCain for caring and doing the right thing (and trying to get @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats to follow through)
Trump's too busy tweeting, playing golf, crying about the NFL & goading N. Korea to pretend to care about all those not white people of PR.
Senator, we have many differences of opinions, but I respect and applaud your persistence with PR.
Thank you SIR 
Sir,I don't like republicans,but you have gone up in my estimation 10 fold,you challenged trump,he tried to humiliate you,but U are strong
Thank you
I hope that bill pass, thx @SenJohnMcCain for that effort. :D
Now that #JonesAct waiver for #PuertoRico has expired Congress must pass my bill providing PR w/ permanent exemption https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=press-releases&id=CD122385-39AE-4DD3-A8FD-B8D66FE3E31E …
Please make this be your lasting legacy, Senator!
Yes!
That's the right thing to do!  These are American citizens!  It should never have gotten this bad!
I like the idea but the good ole boys in the house are pissed off after ACA repeal and replace. Give ‘em Hell senator McCain!
PEOPLE BEFORE PARTY OR NO PARTY WILL EXIST
Please!!! Thank you.

Remember when dem senators attacked Obama?
Me either.
Bob Corker-John McCain have betrayed their voters & disgrace America.
…
I hope so
Thank you Senator
Thank you! Hope you are feeling better. 
Twitter needs the angry button
#PuertoRico should be exempt from #JonesAct just as some territories are. Apart from that not all ships are American owned though fly flag
I'm a Democrat ... and I'd like to kiss you right now.  Keep shining on, Mr. McCain, in every facet of your life. 
John, moral is low among Navy, Marines, at PR. They arrv'd hrs after Maria, gave their blood & sweat to save lives yet no recognition.
You're on a roll Senator. Keep it up 'k.
Stop tweeting about it & get it done.
If it was another tax loophole for rich white dudes, it would already be done. 
People in Puerto Rico are dying. They need helicopter drops of food in the mountains. Roads are washed out. Please help #PuertoRico
Trump Paper Towels:  "Now even more self-absorbent!"  "The Quicker Fucker Upper"
Doing the right thing is never wrong! These Americans need help!
It's nice that you guys can piddle-paddle around with this shit while poor people are dying. Sleep well, old man.
THANK YOU
We know RNC owns most Republicans.  We’re not going to allow this situation to continue. We’re taking back our country!
They are a state, after all. Taxes, votes, moms, dads, cousins, you get it. Seems like the least we could do. #HelpPuertoRico
Yes, please
Thxs sen mccain
why was it allowed to expire?
How do you say "mensch" in Spanish?
You're still alive?
#WeThePeople want to dignify the  lets help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico still suffering the effects of #mariapr @realDonaldTrump
Thank you for speaking out for our voiceless fellow Americans in #PuertoRico 

Most of your party disgraces the country by staying silent.
I'm so very sorry for your illness Sen McCain.  YOU would have made a better President than Trump!!
YES!
Thank you!
Thank you Sir. America looks for true patriots during these times.
Yeah
But they're republicans.  It'll never happen!
Thank you for caring for others during your own recovery. Speaks volumes of your dedication to our country. Thank you.
Thank you Senator for doing the right thing.
Must pass !! R u a dictator
Thank you
Keep it up, John!  Now focus on the real work: Impeaching Trump/Pence. The world depends on it.
What's the holdup?!
Yes please stop cabotage laws(Jones) it's important for Puero Rico  to breath
#ThatsLeadership #PuertoRicoRelief #Illegitimate45 and #DoNothingGOP take action at least pretend that you took oath of office
Thank you Senator for your big heart and good sense! Unlike our WH occupier!
Retire already!!
Bcz it is you McCain, it will never pass. Step down, and resign while there is still a chance u may get a state farewell from the ignorants
Dragging me into your Twitter timeline? How Sad. Go Away Or I Shall Taunt You Again.
Trump makes stupid diversions out of his ego while people are dying he is deplorable !
Yes, and add Hawaii to the bill please!
Just wished you knew what you were talking about, ssd little man
I need your help. I was arrested for trespassing were I lived caring for my parents. This is way people don't trust cops.
You are absolutely correct
Thank you.
Tell FEMA to help these Americans!
Here is another video from Jason Maddy from 10 hours ago. Don't believe anything the MSM, FEMA or POTUS says about Puerto Rico. NEED HELP! 
You have a Bill?  Really?  What about a bill on the promi sea yo u ran on
Thank you Senstor McCain for serving the people! Proud patriot!
Get it done!

Hoping in Unity, Puerto Rico + @Tesla can help Innovation rise, with  renewable energy, making PR the first Solar Island in the world. #news
I agree
How about just killing the Act, period. It hurts ALL countries in need, holding starving and desperate people hostage to special interests
U didn't repeal & replace as u promised! Wonder how u would feel if u had to pay thousands a month for ins for 2 healthy people & huge ded??
@CherokeeNative3 
Who should we call sir?
Go away
Dear @SenJohnMcCain you should come straight out and say you dislike the President and will nver vote for any of his agenda. You have let the citizens of your state down.
Why don’t you & @SenatorLankford use position on FR Committee to demand that Turkey release wrongly imprisoned Rev Andrew Brunson from jail?
Как ваше здоровье?Переживаем за вас.
To everyone in #PuertoRico please look into bio sand filters they are easy to build #DIY might save lives <3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosand_filter …
Most republicans in congress don't care about anyone but the NRA, corporations, and donors.
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for continuing to do the right thing for all Americans!
#Healthcare #Puerto Rico
Yes!! Thank you hero @SenJohnMcCain !
He is a TRUE HERO.....and I'm not republican or democrat. 
@SenJohnMcCain a permanent exemption is what our island had needed for yearrrrrrrrrrrrrrs! Better late than ever! #JonesAct #PuertoRico
Thank you Senator a McCain now protect us from the man in the Oval Office whi is unfit to lead.
Yes!
Senator, I urge your colleagues on both sides of the isle to support this!
Thank you 
@SenToomey @SenCasey  Let's get some movement on this bill. Jones Act is an unreasonable burden that must be eliminated. Vote YES. 19060
And with All the hard work @Bethenny is doing, they need to step it up!!
Senator McCain, isn't it time to speak up about the disaster in the White House, as Sen Corker has?
Just repeal it. It is a legal artifact we no longer need.
Must do practical bill waiving the Jones Act critical to rebuilding Puerto Rico. Rebuilding must be done in light of climate change impacts
Why have you not joined Bob Corker in plainly and directly stating the Predident's unfitness for duty?

@SenateGOP @SenateDems R U listening to your colleague. Do what's right join Senator McCain pass this bill for the people of PR
Sure you have some ult left votes in your pocket after your sinking ACA non vote stranding millions with ins their families can't afford!
You Trump supporters are evil things,  not human beings. You actually don't care about PR because Trump told you not to.
Thanks for doing this sir. This really needed here. In my eyes you will always be a hero. This is further proof of it.
About time you did something constructive!
@liberalgoddess.@CarmenYulinCruz  No.  They need to extend the waiver UNTIL a bill addressing PR's needs is passed.
Not signing anything you draw up. You screwed Arizona. Now you get screwed.
where is the McCain/Collins healthcare LAN to pass through committee or is it just a lie from a bitter old man?
Why would we impose these restrictions on our own citizens in the first place? That alone is a sad stmt #PuertoRicoRelief TU @SenJohnMcCain
Go back to sleep John.
How about passing one of the 300 bills on your desk. Your a NEVER TRUMP Right
Why did Congress not just pass the 1st time? This is why your support is so low and our government is #dysfunctional
Thank you once again for stepping up!
Gather and recruit your troops in Congress, patriotic Dems and Reps, that is the only way to reestablish democracy and order in our country.
Voice of reason again. Please stick around for a really long time.
A voice of sanity!
Join Corker in invoking the 25th Amendment.
