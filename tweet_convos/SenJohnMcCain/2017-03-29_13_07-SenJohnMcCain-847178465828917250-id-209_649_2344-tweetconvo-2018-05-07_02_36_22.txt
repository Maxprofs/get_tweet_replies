And in two more days, March 31st, please honor another great America, born in Yuma, Arizona, César Estrada Chávez.
= Genuine American hero.
Very moving..especially The part abt Mike sewing the flag into his shirt & all of you using it to say pledge.TY Mike, TY Vets
@jaketapper Thank you for your service...you are one tough cookie Mr. McCain. Can't imagine your endurance
Neither can he...why he talked to his captives and is a traitor
Thank you Sir! Now please make sure that draft-dodger-in-chief answers to ALL questions regarding his Russian connections!
You mean the Comrade that you sold out, when you began making PROPAGANDA FILMS for the ENEMY in violation of the UCMJ, SONGBIRD MCCAIN?

.@gaywithajob @SenJohnMcCain how this wasn't a deal breaker with the country is beyond me.
I'm not going to act like I agree much with McCain politically, but that was just disgusting.
I guess Trump is horrified at the sight of patriots who didn't dodge the draft.
Yavol.
Don't try to change conversation...
thank you very much for sharing this story. My faith in politics is restored when I see you & Senator Linsey Graham. 
Thank you for your courageous service and for efforts to bring to justice those in WH w/financial entanglements with criminal adversaries.
thank you for your service!
thank you for your service, sir, then and now. It's a disgrace that our president thinks so little of what you and Mike did.
@arthur_usmcart @SenJohnMcCain Still can't believe what tRump said about "liking ones who don't get caught"
@jaketapper and our President doesn't recognize a true American hero.
Thank you for your service to our country, then and now, Senator. 
Respect, 
from a Democrat
#vietnamveteransday
While Trump was getting four! Yes 4! Deferments and a Trumped up medical excuse- ( "his heel hurt")

Traitor
you're a hero! Not a loser like Trump says. F Trump. You're the man John.
We honor all broken men from this war, whether they broke on their first day, or last day, we remember you and love you.
Being captured in a war doesn't make you a hero, just another prisoner of war. Thanks for your service though..
The man who should have been @POTUS. 

You and all your comrades in arms have my family's gratitude.

@SenJohnMcCain
