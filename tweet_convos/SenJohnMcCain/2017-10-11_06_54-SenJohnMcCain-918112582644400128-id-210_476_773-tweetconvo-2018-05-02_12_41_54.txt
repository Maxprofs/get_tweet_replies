Trump has intentionally CHOSEN to let Puerto Rico & its American citizens there - DIE.  Senator McCain take action!
Sell Puerto Rico as is to Spain. Or maybe Mexico will pay for it.
Shut up half brain RINO McCain

And here's a reminder of #Trump's sickening praise of Turkey's Erdogan AND video of Erdogan's thugs in D.C. 
 https://youtu.be/M8YjxbzGlzw 
https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/918432809282342912 … Mr. McCain can you please do something?
...We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!
stay away from middle east ! Take away your blody paw!!
The Russian, Syrian & Iranian Middle-East Alliance formed through Putin's influences on Trump, gave Turkey permission to go after the Kurds!
And here's a reminder of #Trump's sickening praise of Turkey's Erdogan AND video of Erdogan's thugs in D.C. 


At some point an adult needs to Stop this insanity.
Before it’s too late!
When are we (US) going to realize what a truly evil despot Erdogan is? Or, will we continue winking at his murderous regime?
Now this is a country that is becoming completely isolated.
Your a corrupt man John
Your political terrorism you and your buddies have been stealing our wealth for to long. Bannon is vetting the replacements no more corrupt

Trump is wrecking us!! He's unfit and unhinged. Why the hell aren't you and the @GOP doing anything about it?
We have a threat to American democracy and free speech sitting in the White House. #25thAmendmentNow
Just a reminder that the the man in charge of surrendering will lie about everything.
McCain lying to #American People about Repealing & Replacing #Obamacare. He should resign! #MAGA .@realDonaldTrump  
How much more are We The People Going to Take? Are we going to allow him to kill Puerto Rico now? He’s threatening to pull FEMA! Sick!
@realdonaldtrump What’s more Outrageous is when Sen McCain recovered He choose to go to Rio while his fellow pilots went back to MiddleEast
@ realdonaldtrump What is more outrageous is Sen McCain graduating fifth from the bottom 894th out of a class of 899 In his Air Force class
Hahaha we are not like you 
in my country anybody should know to whether unpenalized of treachery
Or how is it going in your country?
If Trump refuses to protect & defend the Constitution, Congress must do their duty, honoring their own oath of office, and impeach POTUS.
Can we now speak out about Armenian Genocide without fear of hurting Erdogan's feelings?
#America should be afraid bc our @POTUS is questioning #FreePress
The big question is how long until this happens in the US.
 help the president is really scaring me now please save us 
When innocent people charged w/crimes— ruled by criminals. EXACTLY where we're headed with #TrumpRegime. SAVE US!
Thank you for speaking up about this dictator! He needs tobe stopped!
DJT would do the same if he could.  Thank you for all you’ve done but please help remove that man.
Time to retire.
Do you have any idea how STUPID trump is? He is scaring me. Somebody has to do something about this chaos. Where are the voices speaking out
As chairman of the Armed services committee could you please explain why we are not sending federal troops to PR to help American citizens
God bless you Senator McCain now we see what a great American Hero looks like  !
I wish you were our President  !
And they arrested 2 Americans from our embassy.
You don't have to look at Turkey for serious issues for the press. Impeach Trump please
@pen_int anything we (the people) can help with?
Authoritarianism: coming soon to a republic near you.
Senator McCain: please STOP Trump From Nuclear Warfare? Do you Hate Humanity so Much that You don't care anymore for Americans & Humankind ?

Please Sir, call for invoking the 25th immediately...America is not in good hands
attend to your own president - he is going down the same road, and you can still do something about it.

A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
This is what Trump (the clown that is sitting in our president's seat) wants to do to our press!
It'll be happening here next, if you & your cohorts don't stop Trump & his thirst for complete authority. #SeparationOfPowers #Constitution
Maybe you should offer to take his place.
We need to support an independent Kurdistan as a buffer between the ambitions of this 2 bit dictator and the Iranians. Besides, we owe them.
We’re not far behind Turkey at this point.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, a free & independent press is a protected cornerstone of our Republic. 
And Trump will say nothing
Why you should be terrified about Trump and nukes http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/10/why-you-should-be-scared-about-trump-and-nuclear-weapons/ … via @MotherJones
Just wondering how are you going to screw over the American people ( again ) over tax relief? #traitor
Why has the @POTUS Or you mention the 4 fallen heros in Niger? What is Washington hiding?
TURKEY?  HMM.. who was involved with Turkey.. tht was FLYNN.. wht a surprise since Turkey is so upstanding..
This is what our president wants to do. Stay tuned.
And trump continues to praise erdogan.
This is horrific and it is coearly the path our president is currently taking, with his rhetoric re:NBC. This is a slippery slope
Gulag for Erdoğan 
Sounds like something Trump would do. Please speak out. Thank you.

Erdogan has almost established an islamo-fascist rejim in Turkey;
how does this match with the @NATO Charter Preamble / Article 2 ?! 

#Turkey's culture minister Numan Kurtulmus revealed that 169,141 critical books & publications were removed from state-run 1,142 libraries. 
Erdogan is an EVIL dictator.  Turkey should be kicked out of NATO until he is REMOVED.
Shame 
YOU & REST of GOP Proctect a Pervert who WANTs to Disable OUR Freedom of Speech,You cant Critize this ManWhen U Protect TRump&Do NOTHING
@realDonaldTrump seems to be more and more like Erdogan. Make the press the enemy so there is no one to keep tabs on him
Same thing happening in Egypt, China, Russia (oops, sorry, they're just killed in Russia).  #GoldPlatedIgnoramus @25thTHE45th
i agree but i wouldn't expect any outrage from this administration.  He admires dictators.  Reminder @GOP he represents your party.
"...cracking down on anyone his government doesn't like" similar to Trump's outrageous proposition: NBC is fake news & remove licenses!
SALUTE SENATOR.
Don't forget this outrageous facts!
Erdogan & Trump vs. the Free Press. Wonder if they also call each other every morning to coordinate their outfits?
#DictatorInTheWhiteHouse
@realDonaldTrump is almost there, next to the Turkish Dictator and his Fake News.
Trump is trying to do the same here. Be careful.
Hey John, let's worry about Healthcare and taxes.
#25thAmendmentNow
..acted like yesterday didn't happen. Something is off with Trump.  Why do good men do nothing and allow him to march to war unopposed?
How can u sit there & call for order allowing @RepAlGreen  to call for impeachment Bc they don’t like the @POTUS. Don’t be silent now 
Didn't Trump/Rex have lunch yesterday? When asked about it, he referred to his lunch last week, told reporter he was behind on his reporting
some journalists work for the terrorist organization PKK. What would you do if a journalist supported the terrorist in your country?
Get out journalist back now. Period.
Turkey needs to be cut out of NATO because they do not share our values.
Sounds like the same that your orange butt plug buddy wants to be able to do Johnny.
Senator, focus on doing your job we voted for. Put your petty jealousies aside, and don’t block our last opportunity to fix the U.S.
This guy orders protesters in front of their embassy in the US to be beaten. Imagine what they do to anyone who questions them in prisons!
erdogan is a dictateur
Thank you senator @SenJohnMcCain for speaking out for this reporter with finnish citizenship. #Finland
Trump threatened free press again. Please Sen McCain, form alliance and 25th Trump before we become Turkey and/or WWIII
Vote for tax reform. You were an American before you morphed into a Socialist.
So theoretically we are expended our national treasure to get democracy in Iraq and Afghan....and these guys are our allies?  Hold your nose
He is CONSIDERED to be done with
Erdogan (praised by Trump) is a flawless dictator. More than 20.000 in prison without indictment.
You may be the only one who can stop McConnell from destroying our democracy.
McConnell is destroying the norms of the Senate as surely as Trump’s destroying the norms of the presidency. Now: ends home-state judge veto https://twitter.com/phil_mattingly/status/918103475321524224 …
@SenJohnMcCain we need you to speak out and save our country from Trump. Please help us
 You represent the best things in USA.
Trump adores him. One of Trump's besty.
Speaking of freedom of the press, Trump is threatening NBC in OUR country, what are you going to do?
Sounds like ABC
what Erdogan can't do Trump can?
John, Turkey is outrageous, but look at what Donald is doing. He is scaring people. @realDonaldTrump @Secy_State_US @SpeakerRyan #MAGA @GOP
I don’t think the White House is going to say anything. https://trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/istanbul/trump-towers/ …
Just another day for Turkey's dictator
Hand over Gulen.
She promoted terrorism so?
Stalin and Hitler put their heads together and came up with the blitzkrieg
you're choosing 2 B even more degenerate so stop preaching
Hey, didn't you promote the idea of letting Turkey into NATO? RETIRE Brutus
It’s time to realize Turkey is not a reliable @NATO ally anymore
This is a NATO ally??????
Well said   !
Trump will be doing this if the senate doesn't stop him.
and then Trump calls for removal of various news outlets' broadcasting licenses
This is not Russian and wake up
John, read all of the comments below. I hope you hear the real message. Focus on America first  and the needs of your own state.
John should be in the newspaper referral business.
John when will we start the process of impeaching this President of US. He is out of control, need to stop him now.
Please focus on the lack of reasonably priced healthcare options in Arizona. You seem to have lost your purpose. Arizona 1stStop #fanniegate
Retire already
are you bringing attention to this to address #fakenews issues and the #trump battle? Or are you wasting US tax dollars to get involved?
Remember your speech in july and that everything needs go to in regular and we need bipartisan for tax reform and budget please oppose it.
If this reporter can be convicted with no evidence and put in danger of extradition, Turkey has become an authoritarian state.
middle class american's need the medicaid and medicare. Your hero to everyone in us and please oppose the budget and get a bipartisan one.
It sounds to me like another trump or putin?
mcain please oppose trumps budget and its not good for america and i know u want money in budget. But this budget is wrong,  oppose it ok
Turkey is already lost, such things can be expected under a dictatorship.
Senator where do you think America is heading with that Orange Idiot in charge.  It probably could be the next step from his fake news rants.
Our current administration is on the road of doing the same thing.The president's desire to repress free speech is the desire of a dictator.
The president's desire to corrupt the rights of the Constitution is insidious. Americans need to stay awake and not fall under his spell.
Maybe if he gave them US intel like you did in Vietnam, they woukd be kissing his ass and giving him grapes & wine.
The DPRK, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and, now Turkey. Precursory to WWIII? Strong military = deterrence.
Terror content is illegal in any country. How can you justify defending a terror propaganda video, an open door 4 youth self radicalization
US should realise #Kurdistan can be a key player in stabilising the region, #Iran #Turkey r in a quest 4 expansion & continue 2 entice havoc
Do every American a solid and resign
You have been an advocate of counter terrorism Senator. Releasing video of PKK terrorists setting up rockets & weapons is journalism 
Go to help Isis families that half of them have Turkish identities and Stop your silly propaganda
Is this where we are headed? As potus tries to dismantle free press.
You mean lying press?
Crazy! Let's hope it doesn't start happening here!
It is happening here.  Trump is calling for a licensing check of anyone who says something he doesn't like.

No word from the fake pres
http://bit.ly/2wpybpT 
I have friends in Turkey that just packed up and left
But Senator McCain, we have a POTUS who calls Erdogan a friend? And allows Erdogans thugs to beat up American protesters. And ...
Because Mussolini isn't around anymore, I'm pretty sure Erdogan is Trump's role model.
More like Putin, Kim, and Erdogan. In that order.
Somebody should speak out against this. But it won't be Trump. He will support this. Because they are "friends".
Your irrelevant now , u should've put Americans before ur EGO
get tax reform done l.
Hmmmmm. There's something eerily alarming about this as it relates to Trump's war on free press........
Please speak out against Mitch McConnell's war against long standing Senate norms. He's #MakingThingsWorse
McConnell is destroying the norms of the Senate as surely as Trump’s destroying the norms of the presidency. Now: ends home-state judge veto https://twitter.com/phil_mattingly/status/918103475321524224 …
45 is like the leader of Turkey. Trump is unfit and mentally ill. Time for @GOP to remove this madman #NuclearWar
You support Gulen, Turkish billionaire hiding in PA who quietly infiltrates US schools w radical Islam? You traitor. Heard you lawyered up.
Erdogan has become the new dictator of The ME. 
His regime is full of oppression and corruption
Potus loves Turkeys leader. You think he cares about a reporter? He doesn't care about PR. All u guys sit on the Hill watching. U know.
Your healthcare vote to save Obamacare care is outrageous
It’s a real embarrassment that Turkey under the current leadership continues to be part of NATO and an US ally.
Just like you
She's a reporter & a woman. She didn't stand a chance in Turkey.
Their probably right look what their doing here all but patting Antifa on the back in public!
2...this outrageous “conviction” is lifted.
1/We should expel all but a skeleton staff at #TurkishEmbassy, and close our U.S. Embassy at #Ankara completely until...
Please use the power of the US Senate to bring him home. BTW. What is wrong with your friend Lyndsey ? Golfing with Trump? Ugh
We knew this was coming.
Trying to start a war with Turkey now?
Maybe we could focus on our OWN human rights violations.
What about the Turkish guards starting riots over here during diplomatic visits? Jail those assholes.
Maybe the President tried to discredit journalism calling it #FakeNews when that didn't work escalated things. We don't have that in USA...
Bad hombre.  He doesn’t have any powerful agents on our soil, does he?
Yep, this is EXACTLY what @realDonaldTrump is TRYING to move toward and get away with ... per putin's instructions 
Fight on John!!
@lauferlaw @WSJ curious any statement or back up for Senator Corker? you are doing well
This man ruling #Turkey is becoming increasingly like the #Iran mullahs & #Putin
And Trump seems to be tagging along, far back, but approaching their heels close enough in his desire to almost lick their boots.
Dictator 
John: We are aware trump is leading us to war. We know he tries to weaken our government and allow oil companies to spoil our land.
We would appreciate it if you would say so, too.
Sir, let’s focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare and Tax cuts! Please support the american workers/taxpayers.
America is trying to follow these fascist steps as well. When will govt do the right thing and dump trump?
Why does Trump support this dictator
