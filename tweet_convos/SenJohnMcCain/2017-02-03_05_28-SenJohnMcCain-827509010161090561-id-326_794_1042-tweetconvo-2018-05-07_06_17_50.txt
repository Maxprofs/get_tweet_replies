DO SOMETHING.
the American people already did something they voted for Trump.
Nearly 3 million more American people voted for his opponent.
yeah but he's president.
Seems like the American people are sending a message about his performance in the job.
is that right look at the stock market today people are making money today.
Because that is a more reliable indication of how happy people are? Talk about out-of-touch....
Senator McCain, is it true you met with George Soros late last year?
John McCain even met the Rothschilds
You don't say!
people are going to have to get it through their head John McCain is a one-world order Man by George Soros.
I'm beginning to think that way!
Thank you for keeping our attention on the extremely urgent issues around Russia. You will go down in history as a hero.
he's going to go down but it won't be as a hero,, he will always be known as a traitor.
How is Trump getting away with this? He obviously belongs to Putin.
: DJT is unfit. Media should stop acting like he's anything except a clear and present danger. No mystery!
that is what the media is doing.... fortunately they have zero credibility by this time. Got caught lying far too many times.
we need you. PUTIN is out of control!
the pilots in Vietnam needed him to, but he turned his back on them. McCain is a traitor.
Stop working for Soros.
@jlrye52 Can't STAND THIS MAN #Pray4DJT
Neocon lackey @SenJohnMcCain still pushing Zionist #PNAC Neocon agenda vs #Russia to include in #Ukraine: http://america-hijacked.com/2014/02/24/us-has-neocon-agenda-in-ukraine-russia-analyst/ …
@POTUS Meet the war makers https://richardedmondson.net/2014/03/01/ned-jewish-neocons-provoke-crisis-in-ukraine/ … who putsched #Ukraine for PNAC globalism
POTUS says it's fine
What's about this " deal "?
if you don't question Trump publicly, you tacitly approve his actions or lack thereof
How about publicly chastising the rioters...or are you with them?
arrest people who vandalized &/or assaulted others. Praise peaceful protestors.
Investigate Trump and Russia. Bad smell.
don't let trump get away w collaborating w Putin. Also please dump DeVos. She's not qualified

#JustSaying
/ a disgrace to veterans
The Russians are not in our corner.  We must never fall for their deception.  Also, Putin should never be trusted.
voted for the funding of terrorist with Tilllerson. Traitorous acts in the Republican Party. Impeach Trump now
.@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ We need the  pre-2000 SC Primary #Maverick back ...this #Flynn and @realdonaldtrump #Putin issue is deep. #KeepDigging
Please ask Trump to read about this. I know he rarely reads, but he needs to know what he is dealing with in Russia.
why weren't u this Loud when Obama was in office. Since 2014. It's 2017
Senator, if you want Trump to learn anything you have to start tagging him. Ask an intern. @POTUS
Of course if you want the one making the actual decisions you have to tag @StephenBannon
aren't you concerned @POTUS turned off tapes with convo with #Putin? #NOFASCISTUSA
why did you vote for DeVos?
Someone must speak out against POTUS comparing the USA to Putin! It's obscene, he is a killer of his own people! #comeon
you John put a photo of Ukr nazi army in the area where this army is not supposed to be as per Minsk agreement
https://twitter.com/moekamerow/status/826969027381596161 …
Thanks John. Keep holding the line. I know this is awful for you.

He isnt a Hero anymore hard to be a hero when your a traitor like half you on here. FAKE Americans
you have to stop him!
we should stay out of the Ukrainian civil war! NO War!
Senator McCain, do you have ties to George Soros?
I am really totally pissed u keep on stepping on Trump and the momentum the party has.  Knock it off!
DJT is unfit. Media should stop acting like he's anything except a clear and present danger. There is no mystery!
Thank you Senator McCain for standing up for America.
where is America and where is Ukraine?
Why no statement from POTUS?
Now that should not happen. JFK made a deal with Russia on the Cuban crises maybe DJT can do the same with Ukraine.
Please reel Donald in! We are not a country of killers as 45 would have us believe! We need to keep that psycho n chk
voted for you but your really an obstructionist now Senator. Retirement is calling
Thank you for your courage and integrity.  Could you find a few like-minded  republicans to help you out?
he has at least one Lindsey Graham two of a kind the best money can buy.
True  I'm hoping they can find more that aren't interested merely in personal gain.
Don't preach to the choir. Tell Trump to read it.
WHY DIDNT YOU VOTE AGAINST TILLERSON?  Shame on you EMPTY TALK!!!  Put your vote where your mouth and the cameras are !!
Is this because a Russian missile shot you down?
thank you for being the Adult in the room. The Juveniles, including @POTUS love the chaos.
The Ukrainian army is hiding tanks in civilian buildings!
.@SenJohnMcCain @AndreaChalupa @WSJ McCain's deteriorating character is the reason why there must be term limits on politicians
Умники присмотрись Внимательно это Укропы в Авдеевке в нарушении Минских соглашениях
#impeachTrumpnow #trumprussia #bigoilbigmoney #trillions #trumpPutinsockpuppetspy
@owenbernard @WSJ Where is invest into Russia in election, collusion w Trump?
Your bad. Liar and fraud. You have taken dirty money from Soros who has openly said he helped fund the overthrow of Ukraine
You wonder what deal he negotiated with Orban."Little Putin" has been critical of US and EU sanctions imposed on Russia
Please help Ukraine!
Ваше фото подтверждает нарушение Украиной договора эти украинские танки по минскому договору должны быть отведены.
Trump Defends Putin, Puts Down USA When Bill O'Reilly Labels Russian 'A Killer' (Video)
We know you are representing Soros in his fight with Russia and trying to bring the US into war with Russia. #warmonger
Push for an independent commission to investigate Trump's ties to Russia and the interference in our election.  Thank you!
@lizmcq @WSJ do not let TRUMP kill the US. Impeachment TRUMP needs to go. No respect of military. Or your service SB is evil
First Putin said no Russian troops were involved. Now he calls it territorial gains. A rat to the core.
please vote against Bad Betsy DeVos. You know it's the right thing to do.
Hahaha, regime change in #Ukraine is unraveling just like #Syria. Poor #warmonger McCain. Just hurry up & die already.
Get ALT_FACTers on hacking, treason, tax subpoenas & emol. Anything to get rid of Drumpf! Or still all kiss Bannon ass?
.@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Were it not for #warmongers like yourself, jihad would not be being waged across the globe.  You need to resign.
McCain is upset because Putin is taking out the terrorists he armed and aided to overthrow Assad
.@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ I am more concerned about the atrocities that the US government have heaped onto the people of #Libya, Syria, Yemen..
Warmongers like McCain loved Obama's endless drone war on the region.
I agree he wants the US. AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE AN OPEN CABINET IN LOVE WITH RUSSIA PUTIN WILL GET WHAT HE WANTS- TRUMP!
Must Read.. American War Criminals That Are Still Trying To Divide America To Hide Their Crimes  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8JppJyVxYU …
clearly you are obsessed with Putin.  Romney warned back in 2012, did you stand with him?
please don't let up on Russian ties. Our democracy depends on it.
Stop Putin - put in middle defense system that Obama prevented
Truth John McCaine   Putin gave Trump Power - Trump gives Putin Ukraine???  Tell us truth.  Truth to Power!
Mr. Trump's rhetoric regarding protesters as anarchists are warning sign, precedents  in totalitarian societies.
still thinking of the lives that were lost on the MH17. Scary world we live in now.
joke
I'd like to know why Treasury is allowing business with FSB? Very unusual and highly suspicious.
Only success in your life McCain is survive shot down in Vietnam, everything after that you did  is DISASTER
Hey, warmonger Jonny. Your attempts at propping up corrupt Poroshenko regime & his shelling of residential areas is sad. @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ
Thank you for working to get javelins in the hands of Ukrainian troops. Please keep up the effort!
@PatRoberts @JerryMoran @LindseyGrahamSC - Ukraine needs our support @Ukraine #Ukraine
If @PutinRF_Eng  wanted to "ratify his territorial gains" he would pay the Soviet pensions he owes and shoot Yanukovych
Why are you voting for the people that will let this happen. Vote no on sessions devos Pruitt
@potus Soros funded Neo-Nazi's in the Ukraine escalate guerrilla warfare attempting to sour Russian/US relations. #MAGA
Good to see, like Cyndi Lauper song, your True Colors.  You must've missed news your friend Putin poisoned another opposition leader.
plz trumpvovchenko is with Putin and you still supporting him.white house is control by Russia now,wtf with this country
please stand up to Putin.  @POTUS will not
DOES PUTIN SAY WHAT HE MEAN N MEAN WHAT HE SAY? IS PRES BUSH MAKING AN "INFORM DECISION"?!
get off it. The Ukrainian gov is brutal
Sir, this is what slime are putting out there (found on Hannity feed). Caption "friend of ISIS". Alt rt slugs.
You make me proud.
If US & UK won't keep guarantees given to Ukraine, then it will set a precedent that their word/signatures means nothing
What ya gonna do about it?
we must never forget that at the center of everything is Russia. @realDonaldTrump is beholden to Russia.
DJT is working hard to give Putin what he wants. DJT to pick a fight w/Iran ... Russia will jump in & sanctions lifted.
Is it time for NATO & U.S. to join Ukraine's    fight? Russia must be stopped before Ukraine becomes anotherSyria.
Military Intelligence Strategists must weigh all odds & take a strong stand against Putin before it's too late.
I don't give a damn about Ukraine. We are not the policemen of the world. Putin can help fight Isis. That's good for us.
Thank you, you are a true hero, not only a war hero but a true patriot. I wish my sen. would follow suit @tedcruz @JohnCornyn
John McCain, I wish you were my senator. Sad Texan.
File Articles of Impeachment.  America needs you to be a HERO again
@BanjoHfuhruhur @WSJ Hmm. The Maverick speaks his mind...and a well-informed one at that. A bit of refreshment in the milieu
why didn't u vote against Tillerson? He's as corrupt as Trump. U sold the US out to Putin. Your words mean nothing.
Ooh-ooh! I know, we could vote to confirm Putin's best buddy as Secretary of State. Time to go rogue. #theresistance
Agree though WSJ is not trutworthy
AGREE!
-One idea: We're asking two GOP senators to become independent for awhile to save America. #2Revolutionaries @SenateGOP
@LouiseMensch @WSJ -John, Russia - what can be done to invalidate a stolen election?  Otherwise, stop tweeting #WeAreTheStorm
.. Hate to say so ..You're the bad deal !! Remember your place in life. A senator (senior) #not President Trump.
Unfortunately the strong oppress the weak such as the Turks oppress CYPRUS!!!
but has a chance to save people in Ukraine - just provide weapons to Ukraine and ban all russian vip accounts
Dear Mr McCain, US failed to meet obligations under Budapest memorandum, but has a chance to save people in Ukraine
say the #antiTRUST #terrorist #Jews. @Newportbeachpd @FBI @CIA @NSAGov @USArmy @usairforce @USNavy @realDonaldTrump @vp
We know you are moving Soros' agenda against Russia. DOJ needs to investigate your ties to the Dossier, Soros and Russia
It is NOT your say.DO YOUR OWN inside America job &approve the cabinet.Do your job&work for the people who voted you in
Then why does the Trump administration want to get so buddy buddy with these murders?
Trump is Russians Trojan Horse. Prove me wrong!
You are such a hateful war monger always looking for enemies so you can sell arms to them
It looks like Trump IS compromised by Russia and willing to let them do anything-when will YOU call him out on it?
MUST WATCH  https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=dCDJ43uliZ8 …
Thank you so much for doing your part to stand up to Russian hegemony. Too bad the president is so complicit.

Can you see on her a good $200 million secretary of Education thing about all the kids tha
Sir I know that we need to be very carefully and vigilant about Tump/Putin relations but is important for American kids
Trump appears to allow Putin's Russia leeway to interfere in many territories- no surprise that Ukraine ramps up- next?
We need continued investigation into @POTUS and his relationship with Russia.








must-read: #stolenseat #noDevos
You're a GREAT man Senator.  Please do all you can to stop Trump's agenda, he's destroying democracy.
and #POTUS is in bed with this guy. Our democracy is being sold to the highest bidder
Where is your outrage over anarchists and leftist shutting down free speech in our country, and burning college campuses
You and your.  'MUST READ' GET ON BOARD WITH YOUR PARTY OR STEP DOWN #TERMLIMTES
@VanJones68 @DavidYankovich @SenWarren So when are YOU going to stand up and have your brethren impeach Trump?
Can we send help?
keep focus because ther has to be a few sane Republicans in DC
Ever hear of NATO? Don't see our allies rushing in. Let them supply some soldiers for a change.
I agree but most Republicans don't care and especially your great leader Trump.
