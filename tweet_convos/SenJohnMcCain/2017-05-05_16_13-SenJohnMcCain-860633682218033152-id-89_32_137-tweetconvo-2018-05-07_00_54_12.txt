The only thing I want to hear from u is that we are repealing ObamaCare. #KeepYourPromise. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom.
Government should never be involved in healthcare, give to free markets. Trash Trumpcare. #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
#FULLREPEAL #UNITEDFORFREEDOM  The Government has no Constitutional Authority to legislate healthcare.
House tweaks to Ocare not close to #FullRepeal. Stop this outrageous government overreach! Government is not daddy. #UnitedForFreedom
Federal gov't has no power in #Constitution for healthcare involvement. Let free enterprise work! #Liberty #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Remember the promise the GOP ran on and vote no to AHCA. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom 2018 isn't that far off...
What has happened to you... you were edging towards bipartisanship... now you're a sell out.  #SMH

His legacy will not be that of a war hero but a trump puppet.

#TheResistance

Get us out of Russia before Trump finds a way to fire the Senate and House and Judiciary!!!
Please!!!  Stop AHCA!  We want a full repeal.  We want our Government out of our healthcare.
Thank you John McCain for the outstanding article in the NYT's. It was uplifting in this hateful and self focused Trump administration.
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED!  #UnitedforFreedom!
No thanks. You are just somehow going to work in why we need to go to war.
Please save Obamacare
Watch out as not all in the current Administration agree with  how the  Senate  works?
Your legacy is toast. You were once a hero, now you are just another GOP puppet to a tyrant. John, kiss your legacy goodbye.
Hmm I hope you stand up for the poor weak huddled masses as u do for the vets.

Women are a majority of population. There are a number of female Republican Senators, so WHY is 13-member Healthcare Committee ALL MEN?

Please stop extolling our "great nat sec team". Regardless of McMaster and Mattis' strengths, team is a mess.
Nikki Haley, Tillerson, McMaster, Trump/Bannon, & Kushner. USA foreign policy is going in 5 directions at once. https://twitter.com/blakehounshell/status/861034397629374464 …

Trump Russia scandal ?? Why are Trump people meeting Russians then lying about it. Sessions, Flynn, Manafort, others are dirty. @bluedognot
When will you leave the senate and give us a senator from Arizona that actually cares about our country.
What you are not over at Syria doing a pep rally for their pipeline. Isis is missing your advise, Soros is crying as youre not promoting war
Institution of the Senate... 100 somali warlords pretty much describes it
& Devi mishandle of class docs & Drumpf public unmask. Big Bang: all (R) Fascist Toad sympathizers w/Poot banging western democ in ass.

Nancy, did Russia force Hillary to use unsecured servers, destroy emails, kill people at benghazi, use pay for play with CGI, destroy Sander
lefties love you lately. Why is that?
Who gives a f*** what Jim Parsons has to say about anything, or you too for that matter
Senate is corrupt and owned by the 1% who enough is NEVER enough.  You Sir are part of he problem since you choose Party over Country #noGOP
He choose globalism over country and gets paid lots of $$$$ to support their agenda
Trump has Alzheimer's, check it out
I have a feeling that you being anti-trump the way you are, had something to do with his new horrible Sheriff you guys have there in Arizona
Horrible sheriff!? No, we voted him out in November. Unless you live here, you have no idea! He was corrupt and bankrupting us!
In the narcoregimen buses transported Cuban militia to launch them wings streets as "dogs of war" against the Venezuelan young people.
@SenJohnMcCain I won't nor will any of my friends vacation in a country that violates human rights in religion and health and women's rights
Make sure you don't go to the Middle East then
I don't think the Middle East depends on billions in Canadian tourism
IMPEACH. Russia. Save your country.
Really you want to see proof. Obamacare is failing.  You are a republican. Get with the program.   You should not be in office any more
John, do you think @realDonaldTrump should condemn Russian interference in France's election?
Shouldn't we condemn Obama for his interference in France's election?
Nope. Done listening to you
Who the hell is giving you these directives John? They're frivolous.
Disappointing that Jim Parsons would talk to a phony old man like yourself.
Time to go home.   Cows r back   RETIRE
I vaguely remember a guy who shared your name, but he had a spine, morals, a conscience and allegiance to country over party. Wasn't you.
No
You're a hypocritical sell out. Thought you had some integrity John McCain. Getting your wife a job in this POS administration. SAD
Sheldon Sheldon Sheldon...
Tell them you disagree with Trump
Don't worry, he bashes Trump every chance he gets
No thanks. You need to start reporting to work, and spend less time as a talking head. Or, we can pay you hourly for your pt time hours.
institution cause you are all crazy. If there wasn't so much hateful policy that would even be funny.
You keep disappointing me!!!
That's because he does whatever he has to do to win favor of GOP and doesn't give a damn about what the people he actually represents, want
