Why wasn't "having a full compliment of Justices on Supreme Court" a priority for you last year? #HYPOCRITE #MerrickGarland
I'm disappointed in the Senate today. One more string pulled from the fabric of our democracy.
... and because you consistently choose party over country. Embarrassing.
Put your votes where your mouth is.
You knew it was the wrong thing to do but you did it anyway. Shame on you for turning your back on what is right for the US citizens
Your one of the most corrupt politicians and yet you want to past judgement!!! Democrat = Double Standards!
You can blame #Mconnell for gross abuse of Senate traditions #1 priority was to obstruct Obama at all costs. #MerrickGarland
Seems a senate "where the rights of the minority are protected regardless of who is in power at the time" only applies to GOP
Bad idea, sir. Disappointed in you and the rest. Shame.
I think you mean you'll vote to change the rules just to win
This was never about Gorsuch, and you know it. Now you're complicit in all that follows.
I hope you live a long life, to an ancient and bitter age; long enough to hear your children's children's children denounce you as you pass.
You above all should demonstrate the courage of your convictions.  Towing the party line renders you little more than a Republican shill.
You could have #DelayedGorsuchVote until after #investigation.  Your President in under criminal Investigation.  What was your hurry?
Don't seem to remember you standing up to Mconnell to protect glorious "Senate traditions" for #MerrickGarland #HYPOCRITE
You just said you respect the tradition of the filibuster to represent the minority, and yet you voted to end it? #HYPOCRITE
It is unpatriotic to change the rules if you don't like game.This is SCOTUS on first nom, not US Attys on 79th vote; not same as Reid!Shame!
Very disappointed in you.
if Republicans hadn't blocked everything Obama tried to do, everyone he tried to appoint  Sen Reid wouldn't have had to do it
You already brought irreparable damage to senate when you supported GOP block of Merrick Garland's nomination hearings.
REPUBLICANS DIDNT CAUSE THIS, LEFTEST CRYBABY MILK DRINKING DEMS DID CAUSE THEYRE STILL MAD THEY LOST!
@MikeMedavoy "Left with no choice"? Wrong! You had the choice to allow for a nominee amenable to both parties! #Garland
Seems only tradition you are good for is hurling 59 tomahawks to provoke military confrontation. #congressionalauthority ????
Change the candidate
You gave in. Disappointing. We were counting on you.
Voting to change rules that will irreparably damage the Senate is insane. Saying one thing, then doing another destroys your credibility.
Coward.
Then why did you do it? You can't play both sides of the fence McCain. Typical Republican move, change the rules if they don't get their way
; How did you respond when  "Senate change in 2013 by then-Majority Leader Reid"?
200 year tradition? Come on. Thomas was voted in 1991 52-48. That wasn't 200 years ago. Did do damage but no choice. Libs are ridiculous
in other words:

"Excuse me while I shoot myself in the foot."
seems YOU said anyone who would vote for the nuclear option was a stupid idiot.  Yep you are.
You're sadly, all talk.
I see you decided to commit the "irreparable damage" anyway. #MaverickNoMore
You should be ashamed to do the nuke option.
All the respect I gained when you decided to make a stand against Trump and Russia, is now gone. You are a self serving puppet like the rest
If you knew the nuclear option would destroy the Senate and you called those that support it stupid why would you vote for it?
There's an easy way to prevent "irreparable damage": vote against it! You talk big talk but always toe the line in the end. You're a coward.
Marshmallow
all you had to do was vote the right way
and you didn't
You're a sad, old coward who's betrayed his country. And you knew it. Traitor.
"I will cram this shit in my mouth, not because I doubt it will taste awful, but because I'm a moron" There. That makes more sense.
Then walk the talk, Senator. #coward #justoneofthesheep
Just once I would like to see a republican vote for what is right, and not for the party.
Hypocrite as always old as fuck white man
Yet you voted for the change anyway. What happened to you?
The Dems leave you no choice.
You can not possibly do any more damage to the Senate.   The Dumbocrats have already damaged it all the way to hell.
This is a black eye for the USA. On the bright side, this action may be a deadly move that destroys the GOP for putting party first.
Terrible decision. That makes you just another partisan hack. Congratulations on debasing yourself.
Mr. McCain, I am very disappointed in your vote today. You sold out America even though you know it was bad for this country. Shame on you!
you're now the Nazi party, congrats
Agree with everything u said, except for the part about changing the rules, 2 wrongs don't make it right my friend.
However, I appreciate you laying out your principles so clearly so that your constituents know exactly how badly you betrayed them for party
Was the Democrats filibustering Gorsuch more or less unprecedented than you refusing to even have hearings on Garland? #blameyourself
One Major Reason POTUS was Voted IN was to Make a HUGE difference w/ SCOTUS..This IS LIFETIME DECISION!
Disappointed in you, sir. You spoke out against it, you know it's wrong, but did it anyway. I thought you were braver than that.
The Senate has been irreperably damaged for years. Draw swords and fight to the death! Go nuclear!
Very disappointed in you. Would not have thought you would become a party-first America- second senator.
Damn, so disappointed. I thought you would be one of the few voices of reason in the @GOP. Disappointed, and will not forget. #TheResistance
"I'm voting for this IRREPARABLE HARM TO THE SENATE with great reluctance..."

You Sniveling Sycophant

#PartyBeforeCountry
@adarshp then why did you vote yes? Time to show leadership & you failed.
Party above country vote invalidates your rhetoric. Crocodile tears.for an institution you value less than partisan power. Time to retire.
"This action will cause irreparable damage to the Senate"
#PartyBeforeCountry lickspittle votes for it anyway
"BUT LOOK HOW RELUCTANT I WAS"
I had great respect for you until this day. Stand for your principles.
Wow, it appears that 95% of your followers are liberals. I guess that says it all. Your time in office is over with. RETIRE!
Then why do it? Party before country, thought you was better than this. Bad decision, but just as long as McConnell gets his way...right?
These times are so scary - we need a principled conservative to stand up and help protect our democracy. Please be brave again.
The Maverick is now known as The Spineless Jellyfish.
So much for being a maverick with a conscience. So disappointed in you. 
The GOP has shown it's true face as the party with no ethics and no morals. You will literally do anything to win. I would be ashamed.
So you are telling your constituents, "This does irreparable damage to Senate, but I'm OK with that." You've been there too long.
Reluctance means nothing. What counts is your vote, and now you have to live with your vote to intentionally cause harm to the country.
<= traitor, globalist, closet Democrat, says it all about MCCain!
If you believed this vote would cause "irreparable damage," then you wouldn't have voted for it.
This is very disappointing Senator McCain. If you know the nuclear option will do "irreparable damage" - vote AGAINST it!
Then why do it?!? #hypocrite. So you intentionally voted to don"irreparable damage".
Where's the #Maverick Ldr I have always believed you to be,whether we agree or no? Deeply disappointed in you.
#FakeMaverick
You went against even your low principles again for what?  It's like smacking your kid & saying it hurts you more than them.
You and I do not always agree on policy, but I recognize and appreciate your integrity, sir.
Then the prudent thing to do would be to vote against rule changes, right? Asking for a friend.
I cannot wait for the day YOU are not my Senator (fr AZ) anymore. #Shameful
I see the Republicans couldn't do the right thing today. Shame on all of you. I've lost all faith
You are a coward. If you're against it, don't vote in favor of it. #countryoverparty
And you did it anyway. You sir, are all talk. Eventually you always choose party over country. #shameful
So the small number of Americans in Republican states get to outvote the majority of Americans in Democratic states.Flaw in our democracy
You are knowing and willing voting to change rules that you know will cause irreparable damage? Don't do this wrong just to appease party.
So why the hell did you do it?!
To knowingly cause irreparable damage to the Senate -  Is that the oath you took when you were sworn into office?
Well, this sure sends a message. trump was right, mccain is no hero.
You are such a #gutless bs artist. #treasonous GOP
"I fought it back when it was a Republican attempt (to dismantle the filibuster) and I fought it back when it was a Democratic attempt.”Liar
Shameful that ALL of you in this deplorable SENATE are just worried about being re-elected, and not with the integrity of Senate or COUNTRY!
man up. Stop this dictatorship. You are being held hostage because you know better.
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
It is choice if changing the rules is bad for America then fight for your country
"This is a really bad idea. But I'm going to do it anyway because I actually don't care."
McCain just does s better job of pretending to care
Coward.
@JudgeNGorsuch should be ashamed: nominated w/<60 by @POTUS under FBI criminal investigation and w/ 10M PAC black money ads behind!SHAME!
Shame on ALL GOP Senators 4 placing partisan  politics ahead of COUNTRY! YOu  have voted Justice to join a court that NEVER had a <60votes!
You know you are causing permanent damage but you're going to do it anyway? Where are your principles?
Not exactly a profile in courage, Senator.
RELUCTANCE does not make it right! I thought you had more courage than this...Shame on GOP, placing a judge that has PAC ads pushing agenda!
If you thought those who would  vote to change the rules are stupid, why did you vote to do it? I have no faith in you. Nobody should.
a lion on camera, sheep behind the scenes. Shame on you!!
You speak with integrity and patriotism...but vote the opposite. Sad day for Democracy.
You hypocrite! The Dems r respecting the Senate rules that you claim to love yet you vote to destroy. Spare us your crocodile tears.
Actually, this is worse. Stand your ground! They have enough votes without you
Here we go again making rash decisions, you ALL are out of control. Except you know the consequences. Please Abstain
So you were fine with blocking all HRC picks and will now ruin the Senate b/c the GOP are petty childish thugs now. Also u blame the victim?
funny, thought the point of being an elected leader was NOT to do irreparable damage - have I had it wrong this whole time??
I thought you might be one of the few to put country before party. But apparently those were just words. You're no better than the others.
All those nasty words & you caved anyway. SMH I had hope.
How can you burn the house down twice? McConnell already torched it last year with his banana republican "leadership."
Why are you voting to do irreparable damage to the Senate? I thought you valued your country above your party. Am I wrong?
COWARD!!!
Shame on you. Love of country doesn't seem to equal love of party or power.
Coward
I am disappointed in you sir as I have stood by you through many turbulent times. This will further polarize our country and you support.
With great reluctance? Ha! You are all bark & no bite. Why say things you have no intention of following through on?
@DianeLustig PLEASE vote no on Judge Gorsuch if he really plagiarized decisions and parts of his book.
Stop it.  Your complaints are hollow
Right.  After what the Republicans pulled with Obama nominee, they are crying foul for a filibuster?  The circus continues.  ps your fired.
You have a choice. Gorsuch and your party are obviously more important than any tradition you hold dear.
So very saddened and sickened that you have gone along with this. This is what is wrong with our government. Expected more from u. But no.
Americans want compromise. After Merrick Garland, the ball is in your court. Vote no on nuclear option.
Please say no to the #NuclearOption this will cause irreparable damage to the senate and the US government. You are an honorable man.
honorable? Lmao ok
He has his moments. But yeah. You're right 
where all getting palyed at the end of the day. Just gotta pray that it will be ok
Then don't do it!  You know it's wrong.
I served under this man in 1975, he is honorable, although a war hound. I did not vote for him but he is right on this one! True courage! 
Or don't fucking do it and help maintain checks and balances.
Don't do it!
if you vote to change the rules then I hope you can sleep at night
so we wont be a republic? We"ll be a parlimentary democracy? May as well change the whole constituion you swore to uphold
Then don't vote for it. Your "reluctance" means nothing. Your actions say "it makes the senate better", despite your derision yesterday.
You had a chance to be an American hero again. You blew it. As one of the Arizonans you supposedly represent, I am disgusted by you.
Senator, Democrats were voted in, they answer to their constituents, they have a right to vote their mind, this is democracy, God bless USA
So many Dems on this page wow we will have Justice Gorsuch he's an amazing judge and man !!!
when good men do NOthing and voting for something bad that you know is. is doing nothing . Talk is cheap. a vote is precious
i feel like i will lose hope forever in our government if this happens . and if you do so despite knowing its Bad.. geesh. there is..no hope
ble men and women to Do the right thing. not just because any Party demands it.  if you say Idiot . then Please do Not vote to change.
Then do the very thing you know to be idiotic? then who is the idiot dear Sir This is Wrong Stand up and do the right thing. We need honora
no...if you vote 2 change rules you Know will be harmful ,i will never believe you stand for Right again. NO good to call others idiots and
We don't believe you change the rules get Gorsuch on the Supreme Court stop acting like a traitor and a Dem !!!
"Glory belongs to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself, ... to your PRINCIPLES, to people ... who rely on YOU" JM
Shame on you!!!
Please Senator.  You made huge sacrifices for this country in the past.  Stand up again for what is right. Step back and rethink this.
You can work to set things right.
Your words are so often hollow; ie, you seldom vote against your party, which ironically now has become Breitbart and extremists.
Funny you see the Senate as not already "irreparably damaged".  A true insiders point of view.
Do the right thing for once. One. Damn. Time.
Since you know changing the Cloture Rule will damage the Senate, why do you want the Senate to be damaged?
Then don't vote to do it, if you think it's wrong.
The irreparable harm is to our Constitution and the millions who will feel this man's bigotry in the name of his faith.
You don't have to play a part in damaging our democracy.  If you do this will be your legacy along with McConnell
Hogwash, Hypocrite.  Your talk is cheap.  Your vote is an insult to all.  No integrity from you or any GOP leadership.  Shame on you.
Very disappointing.Your loyalty to party and  admitting you know it is wrong for country is shameful.
Sir thank you for standing now w/your party and the president. This is our one time in 8 years and we need to take advantage of it!
So you'll vote w/ your PARTY over the "irreparable damage" it does to the COUNTRY?  What a fucking joke! #ImpeachTrump #ITMFA #TheResistance
DO NOT VOTE TO CONFIRM GORSUCH. Your constituents
NO NO NO NO NO. Republicans created this mess with MG. I expect you to show more integrity.
What a hypocritical windbag.
then you are no maverick sir .. you're all talk and no action.
Please DO NOT vote to change the rules! #CountryOverParty #NoNuclearOption Please stand up, do the right thing and vote NO!
So don't vote for it if you believe it's a bad idea. You do somethings right but always manage to drop the ball in the end.
A SCOTUS nominated by a POTUS that is under investigation for treason SHOULD NOT be confirmed.

Dear @SenJohnMcCain - please, this is a time when we need you to be #TheMaverick we've come to love. Do NOT go nuclear. Pls do NOT.
@SenJohnMcCain What Video are they blackmailing you with? #TimeWoundsAllHeels You will be held to account for your betrayals.
Same guy who blocked a basic meeting, not even a vote, on Judge Garland.  Discredit to the Senate.
#TimeWoundsAllHeels We are witnessing your behavior, Jesus is, too. You will be held to account for your betrayals.
Please don't! As one of the last sane members of the Senate you understand the irreparable damage this will do, DON'T VOTE FOR IT!
lol, someone get poopy pants a fresh diaper, 'I am voting to do irreparable damage to the senate'
When are you ever going to realize the real war is with the left? You just can't see the Forrest because the trees are in the way
more useful to go sign up 2 GOP colleagues and you 3 vote no and those votes set McConnell back. For America.
It's shocking that you would let Judge Gorsuch be confirmed.  I thought you were a man who does what you think is right.
Gorsuch favors corporations over individuals. But so does the Republican party, so I guess he's perfect for you. No nuclear option!
As long as you feel bad about it then I guess irreparable damage is OK.
Are you a wimp?
remember any rule you change will be used against us in the future as our voters realize these actions will set us up to lose to Democrats
I thought you were a stand up guy,on the side of what's right !This smells like(if I can't win, I'll take my marbles & go home)or(chg rules)
You, sir, are simply no maverick. How did you ever identify yourself as such?
