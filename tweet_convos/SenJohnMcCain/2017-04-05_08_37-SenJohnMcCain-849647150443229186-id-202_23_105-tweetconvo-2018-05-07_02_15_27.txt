You are right. That is why Garland did not get it and Gorsuch will.
Plagiarist?!? You truly must JUST read headlines. He was speaking about the facts of a case. He can't change facts. Do some research
You should ask the person who wrote the original piece. They stated NO plaugerism took place. He described facts that is why theyre similar
You Republicans shouldn't be stretching your muscles to change the rules! That's crap and I will truly be done with all of you!
You can thank Harry Reid for the nuclear option
Thanks Harry!!  Now lets confirm Gorsuch.
We should not be putting someone on a lifetime appt in which the President is under criminal investigation

Don't think that what's happening in Syria can't happen here you foolish blind person #rabbitholeisdeep
A nomination to the Supreme Court has no connection to national security. We have many different agencies to handle that.
Yes! It does! This Supreme Court judge was a major right leaning judge and should not be appt'ed during a time when admin is under invest.
Here's your chance to actually be a maverick. Country before party. You will be responsible for nuclear option.
Yep country before party; that is why Gorsuch  needs to be confirmed
Confirming Gorsuch would mean that the Garland strategy is appropriate. This changes everything
It was the dems idea for a President NOT to appoint in his last year. So according to them, yes it was appropriate.
Source? If you say Biden, please read entirety of his statement in the context of the statement. Spoiler: that's not what Biden said
Did you forget that it was the dems idea not to appoint a nominee in the last year. Did you forget that?
Tell your friend McConnell the GOP is on its way out. He started it when he refused to even have a hearing for Merrick Garland.
2/ This is the end of the rule of the Republicans. You want to feed the rich and starve the poor.
4/ I did not vote for Trump, but of those who did, there are many who are expressing "buyer's remorse". This is bad. Bad!
5/ What do you think the world thinks of America now? Are we still viewed w/ respect, as world leader, as "greatest country in the world"?
7/  I doubt seriously that any of them or people who are influenced by them are voting for GOP candidates ever again. Why?
8/ Between Trump the pussy grabber pathological liar obviously being helped by the Russians - i.e. invited by Trump on TV to find emails...
10/ You've had your chance. Complained like hell for 8 years. Dragged your heels. FILIBUSTERED!! SHUT DOWN the GOVERNMENT! Remember that?
Do not support gorsuch. Stolen nomination. This is the beginning of very bad times, to blatantly subvert our govts working for narrow agenda
Just like Obama's far left/socialist agenda? That"narrow" agenda? Finally we have a chance to restore America's place in the world
Here's where John should lead the charge & rein in Trump & McConnell. That would be guts and putting country before your Party. Won't happen
Rein in what? More of the Obama days? Sorry, that nightmare is OVER!!! Time for things to be corrected
So you are in support of the corruption? I had hope. No to everything trump untill #trumprussia investigation is done
I'm sorry that the THUG POTUS has done this. You know this should have been President Obama's SCOTUS nomination.
This should not be happening with Trump under investigation....
Trump shouldnt be under investagation,obama should
How can you support Gorsuch? Actually, how can any of you? Changing rules bc it doesn't fit your agenda is not ok.
If you voted to go nuclear then SHAME ON YOU, SIR.
I expected you to vote with people---not party!  Extremely disappointed!
This is exactly why nobody cares about your criticisms of @POTUS, you are just as guilty of toeing the party line
Changing the rules because you don't like the result is not what your constituents want. When will you start listening to your constituents?
His constituents want Gorsuch confirmed!!
As one of his constituents, I can tell you your blanket statement is untrue. You must live in some rural area...
If Phoenix is rural, then ok.
Was referencing Miss Rodriguez.
Reading his social feeds his constituents do not want Gorsuch confirmed. Or the rules changed.
What about the consequences of a lifetime appointment of dark money? Gorsuch was selected off list special interest approved of..
Please tell us where you got you exclusive inside information, we would all like to know
Are you and your colleagues proud?
One of my proudest moments would be punching senator McConnell right in the face.
Aww, now, violence is never an answer.  
Hit him by working to make him lose next election!
Already on that one  Mitch is going to have to live among the very people who's life he is ruining.
@SenJohnMcCain country first! Party line votes are not what your constituents want!
Please do not change the rules.  Please.
Did you say that when the dems did it dozens of times to appoint federal judges? Why not? Do tell....
Didn't hear you say that @SenateGOP filibustered SEVENTY NINE Obama noms. OK for @GOP to filibuster 79, but @SenateDems can't filibuster 1?
No one said they can't. Let them do it and then simply use the nuclear option.
You're being intentionally obtuse... @SenJohnMcCain is saying how "bad" nuclear option is, yet was complicit in unprescedented obstruction
I don't know how I missed this: We here in AZ don't care what Mclame has to say. he has truly lost it. We can't wait until the election.
Sen. McCain, pls think twice before giving a lifetime term to a guy appointed by a possibly treasonous, compromised president.
Please. please give us facts on the treason he committed. If you somehow have evidence the Justice Department doesn't why not give it
I have secret evidence
If you did you would trip over yourself to get it to the Justice Department. Stop speaking in headlines and produce facts please.
On obama and rice
CNN talking points. Rice its jail time
Obama worst pres ever.
Fight for the high ground. We  heroes who were captured. Supreme Ct Justices need 60% for a reason. Vote no on nuke option!
Dems would win in the long run, and I'm a Dem, but I know bipartisanship is still best for the country. Take nuclear option off the table.
Just get 2 or 3 conservative scouts picks and screw the liberals. Harry Reid started this fight, you finish it!
"I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton...would put up" - @SenJohnMcCain 10/17/16
I was thrilled when he said that, but now he appears to be against a publican nominee as well.
NO TO GORSUCH!
You called anyone that would advocate a #NuclearOption is an idiot.  Mr. McCain, meet Mitch McConnell.
you are betraying us, John
Yep; betraying the Republicans.
No!!! betraying the american people.  the GOP betray us long ago.  They put party before country.
How is confirming a HIGHLY qualified justice to the Court betraying the American people? Please tell us.
Once again not listening to your constituents and putting Party above country. It is official. You are pathetic.
McCain: What we are poised to do will have tremendous consequences and I'm confident we will regret it ---> will vote to end filibuster.
Tremendous consequences for the loony left.
Do not support Gorsuch until the status of 45 is complete.
Country before party.  The alternative is treason.
You're ok with stealing this seat from Garland to hand over to Trump's man? You would have been the first to cry FOUL if Demos pulled this
Why would you support this guy?  He is not right for America?  Stop waiving the gop flag and be what America needs
unconstitutional, whereas the filibuster is a foundational right to be protected
I repeat Mr McCain, U are an awesome patriot. But going nuclear is unpatriotic   YOU HAVE A CHOICE!  New nominee.
Do you have any integrity left, McCain?  If so, use it tmrrow! Tell the sack of shit McConnel what you really think of him.
And in the end you caved and did something as hypocritical as it gets.  Bummer.
You do remember declaring you'd oppose ANY #SCOTUSnominee Clinton nominated if she was elected President, right?
so disappointed in you
NO on Gorsuch.
Shame on you all. That is not the way to elect Scotus for a lifetime appointment
Look McCain- if Dems were in power and needed to they would do it. So stop rambling about it. All will get bit sooner or later.
I used to respect you before you chose Palin as running mate.  My confidence in you has recently restored.  Be a patriot not a puppet.
You trust the crooks in the WH to do the right thing?  Were all dead if 45 has his way EPA gone! won't need it..none of us will be breathing
You are rushing thru this nomination B4 Trump admin further implodes. Disgraceful!
I wish you had 1/4 the balls of Harry Reid when he pulled the NUCLEAR OPTION.  Are you so old you forgot!!!!
Change. The. Nominee.  I can't state this any clearer.
No. No. No. I can't state this any clearer.
Again, change the nominee!!
Senator, please reconsider. This nominee would have been a perfect fit for the Court - in 1920.
Hey Mike; the Constitution is just as valid as it was 90 years ago.
Why go on Tv and call people that want nuclear options knuckle heads, when you are one and the same.
I know you will work hard to get the 60 necessary votes.  Grateful you represent Arizona proudly.
#sellout
Do not change the rules to place Gorsuch on the court. please @SenJohnMcCain. PS your voice mailbox is full . 
The dems did it dozens of times when they appointed federal judges. Did you miss that?
Do not change rules because of outcome not ok with you. Wrong wrong.
has he every said where his 10 million dollar"gift" came from?
#VoteNo on nuclear option. You are supporting a treasonist president. You DO have a choice! Listen to your AZ constituents
As an Arizona resident, I implore you to vote NO on Gorsuch.
As an Arizona resident and I impore him to vote YES Gorsuch.
#WeNeedRealLeaders in the US Senate. #thanks
Find a consensus nominee. If he can't get 60 shouldn't be SCOTUS
Gorsuch is corrupt in every way
Please state the details on his corruption. We would ALL like to hear the evidence.
Please by all means, change the rules.  Someday the shoe will be on the other foot.
How about the consequences of plagiarism?
If you help steal this seat you lose all credibility. The Republicans have little left as you allow trump and company to rape America.
Of course you are. As usual, you are on the wrong side of history. If it's not war related you don't hav a clue.
History does not have sides, just facts
34% approval. Being investigated by FBI. Everything is in shambles. We sure could use a Maverick, instead of a rubber stamp John
Have great respect for you. Think Reid did go Nuc because MitchMcC filibuster more of Obama's judges then happened to ALL prior presidents
Seriously John, it's not a profile in courage to issue a statement 'we will regret ending the filibuster' and then vote to end it.
What John should do is enable McConnell and Trump just a little bit more. It's not like they're already dead drunk with power. Maverick!
Instead of McCain leading charge to rein in this power grab he issues tough talk that's hollow and will do his duty for McConnell. Maverick?
John, could we please just clean out the White House before we go appointing judges for life chosen by Trump and his Russian compatriots?
Please, please present your evidence of @realDonaldTrump's Russian involvement to the Justice Department, they dont have any; neither do you
Get him confirmed!!
NO CONFIRMATIONS UNTIL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING CONCERNING RUSSIA. IT IS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.
The ONLY hero is @SenJeffMerkley U can't #holdthefloor for even 1/4 of time he did 2 speak truth. He put country b4 party. Heart over evil.
John.The Senate is broken.Denied  President right to nominate  Supreme Court justice. Coup d gras. Now, country not far behind thks to Rebls
Who cares. You love dark money as does #gorsuch How does a senator get as rich as you? By breaking laws and selling out our country.
Please report any facts you have on law breaking to the Justice Department; or are you just spouting off without substantiation?
"I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up" Oct2016
If u confirm Gorsuch, u r lying when u say u support your country...unless u mean ur country is Russia. #StopGorsuch be a true hero.
Gorsuch wll be confirmed to support out country and right the wrongs Obama did to our country
Gorsuch stands 4all that is wrong w/the world. He uses "religion" 2commit injustice,corruption,inhumane, & his factual history proves so.
A judge following the LAW is NOT doing any injustice. The law is the law whether people "feel" good about it or not
Confirming a SCOTUS judge while POTUS is under FBI investigation is wrong. History will not look kindly on you.
U can't vote for this man!
Gorsuch, like Trump, plans 2take US back 2medieval times: no human rights, dark money/greed, animal torture, no health care. #holdthefloor
Have you lost your mid?!? Judges FOLLOW the law, they do not make law. Tell us one time that he or any judge took away rights, hurt animals
Thank you for supporting #JudgeGorsuch - Kent from AZ
Merkley whines his pick didn't get a vote when everyone knows if the shoe were on the other foot they would be doing exactly the same thing
You cannot invoke nuclear option!  Our democracy needs a stable system of replacing Supreme Court judges.   Where will it end
Did you say that when the dems used it dozens of times to appoint federal judges? Waiting........
disappointed in his decision.
you and the @GOP thugs stole this seat. You should be ashamed of yourself. Maverick? You're a fool. All words nothing else.
That "seat" belongs to the people. It was not anyone's to be stolen It was the dems idea for a President not to pick a nominee the last year
you have no honor nor shame
If the nuclear option is needed, use it!!
The filibuster is a gross waste of time. It is NOT productive and makes the Senate look like it isn't serious. GO NUCLEAR!
No probe no robe
Dems like probes
#JudgeGorsuch #fakehuman. #JohnMcCain #fakehuman.
Gorsuch is an extreme nominee who puts fundamental rights at risk. Please #NoGorsuch. Don't break senate tradition for Trump.
Traitor @SenJohnMcCain definitely on Team #TrumpRussia.
#NoGorsuch #StopGorsuch NO SCOTUS for @POTUS Under FBI Investigation. #holdthefloor
It would have been for you to have been this concerned when Garland was nominated.
Actions speak louder than words!
Gorsuch NO, Nuclear option NO, better nominee.
The only better nominee would be even MORE conservative and even more of a original Constitutionalist.
No! He should not be confirmed when we have a president being investigated! I disagree with you here. Focus on the corruption not add to it
The nuclear option is not the only option! Listen to the people. At least give Garland a fair chance.
Garland IS NOT what the people want. WE want a conservative Constitutionalist.
By approving Gorsuch u r choosing to destroy US and give Putin power. ICYMI that's what's going on in the govnt - #TrumpRussia #holdthefloor
Are you truly that starnge? What does Gorsuch have to do with Russia? . that is out of left field.
Go work for CNN oh wait you do
“This issue is not about any single nominee – it’s about the integrity of the Court.." - @SenJohnMcCain on Obama nominating #MerrickGarland
Yep, Gorsuch will put integrity BACK in the court.
No
Disappointed
how the fuck can a war hero support the nomination from a Russian president?    I'm ashamed.  You should be too.
Your constituents want you to vote #NoGorsuch
Respectfully Senator, calling someone a stupid idiot for being casual re nuclear option, then voting for the nuclear option doesn't compute.
Why don't you and Lindsey try to be a bridge instead of instigating partisanship?
I just watched you speaking on the Senate floor.  I want to thank you for speaking to both sides and from the heart.
I am a registered Democrat and I feel as though both sides need to work together to truly make this country great again.
Also, it starts by investigating Russia to the fullest and if Trump has ties to Russia he needs to be Impeached.
Don't allow #Nuclear Option
Did you say that when the dems used it dozens of time to appoint federal judges? Why not?
If U believe  nuclear is bad then put words into action. U know Garland should have had vote, not Gorsuch. Vote NO on principal. SAD NATION.
Fine give garland a vote. Simply vote the loony lefty down and THEN confirm Gorsuch.
@JeffFlake  I & many other citizens have called, written, emailed, & (gawd help us) tweeted to Senate that #gorsuch is unfit for #SCOTUS
#MerrickGarland should have 9th seat on #SCOTUS  The only reason he wasn't given the seat is that he was nominated by @BarackObama
it was the dems idea that no President should appoint in his last years. Did you forget that?
You Rs are such hypocrites.
Time for you to retire you dont know which way you are going but seems to be up trumps a$$. 2018!!!!!!!!
How about facts not nasty homosexual innuendo . Try again
All your words mean nothing if you nuke the filibuster. Republicans escalated with Garland blockade. You can stop destruction of Senate.
Who needs the filibuster? Your Democrat pals saw no use for it when it served their needs.
YES
If you want Judge Gorsuch so badly, nominate him for the next spot after seating Garland.
Not every nominee is confirmed. Garland would have never gotten enough votes. Go ahead and vote, he will be denied the seat anyway
Nothing like approving and trusting a nominee offered by a POTUS under FBI investigation -are you serious?
You mean the investigation with 2 FISA wiretaps, an FBI investigation and still NOTHING. Keep trying loony left there is nothing there
Thanks for your service Sir McCain.
Sorry to hear you support Gorsuch, Senator.  But then again you did vote for all? Trump's horrid cabinet picks so not a surprise.
This is historic, how often has the current SCOTUS ever ruled unanimously? Gorsuch made some grossly heinous decisions.
#NewCandidate
I hope you are lecturing your own party
On not listening to the losing for 8 years  dems
#Don'tGoNuclear #NoGorsuch We the People not we the Corporations, we are tired of cheaters being put in office, how can a cheater make laws
Reid and chucky sais nuke is good
Nope; Nope
Obama and hillary putins love puppets
Go back to bed John, you get cranky when you're old... #ItsTimeToRetire
shame on you for supporting Gorsuch.
Thk u for opposing the nuclear option, which will destroy the Senate and our country.
#HesNoMwrrickGarland @SenJohnMcCain
You left out that Obama requested consent from Congress to intervene in Syria. That omission is, at best, disingenuous.
#TheWholeTruth

Ha!
the nuclear option took place when you denied Garland a hearing and FOREVER changed how SCOTUS picks r made Hypocrites all
Go get 'em, cowboy!  #TheOriginalMaverick
Disappointed. Disappointed. Disappointed.
So sad, John. Every time you start to win people over and gain genuine broad based admiration and support, you thrown it down a toilet.
No you didn't. I had given up but if you mean it vote NO on Gorsuch based on principal...Garland should have had vote except obstinate GOP
Principal? Since when did any of them have any principals?
Right Dems dont
Vote on Garland nomination first.
Waste more time
Good for you!
You'll be supporting a corporatist.
Seriously @SenJohnMcCain ? Where's your moral compass?
Sold it to special interest. He no longer has a direction.   #sad
Ah, the all talk, no action 'maverick ' is talking some more.
Then don't pursue the nuclear option, find another nominee!
Why? To satisfy the dems? I do't think so. The Repubs are in power. The party in power gets to make the choices. Are you new to this?
supporting a man who supports corporations over people. How Republican of you.
Military industry and Soros own him.
Don't support him.  Get some balls and use your damn brain, McCain.  You have more integrity than this
Vote him in
Democrats are tired of Republican obstruction. I am a moderate but asked my rep for this because of McConnell's actions. GOP hypocrites!
Good for McConnell. Keep those leftist Socialist judges out of the SC. Bravo! A win!
Do you think that a dishonest, treasonous president will put forward an honest candidate?
You must be talking about Obama

Maybe u should b concentrating on the traitor in the WH instead of fighting the dems and changing the rules to fit your own agenda! Bullshit
Talk about b*******
your one of my "contra-indicators"...so, i'll check my compass against yours when your done.
Urge your colleagues to vote no on the #NuclearOption.
