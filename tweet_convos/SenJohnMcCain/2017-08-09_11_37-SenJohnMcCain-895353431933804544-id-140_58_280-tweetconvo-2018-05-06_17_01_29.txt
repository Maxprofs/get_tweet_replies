You lost when you ran for president. You had to get a pardon from Nixon. Trump and Mad Dod definitely do not need your Afghan plan.
A real war hero would support President Trump!
Says who?  Another coward who avoided military service?
.... stay off that ship Johnny !!!
R y'all finally going 2pick up 600 POWs u left behindWander how many still r alive
#WeStandWithTrump #MAGA
Judas




Read up on McCain ..... his whole life is filled with TREASON ....and his Treason has not stopped !! 
Why did Nixon have to pardon him ??
@SenJohnMcCain Please explain to the American people why your fellow soldiers called you "Songbird" & why you needed a Presidential Pardon 
He didn't. But don't let facts get in the way.

@SenJohnMcCain would rather see America fail than @POTUS Trump succeed!!
Support President Trump where are you principals?
McCain chastised Trump: "You gotta do what you say you're gonna do." Yet HE DIDN'T DO WHAT HE PROMISED ON OBAMACARE!
Good comrade McCain does mean you'll be resigning and returning back home to Vietnam I mean u betrayed & lied to we the people here Songbird

That is good news.  Great news would be your resignation.
While you are listening, was your criticism of the President on NK warranted considering you call Kim Jong-un a little fat man?
Better News: John McCain shuts up finally quits grand standing as a democrat.  @POTUS @TrumpGirlStrong
That's good news how, 116%, NK, with nukes and can reach USA,  your a sad little man
You are a hero
Go with them , maybe they will keep you this time
CLASSLESS....just like your trashy president.
.how is this good news? just shut up!
Good thing #McCain won't be around to start a fire on it #Resign
Resign
DRAIN THE SWAMP
Wow John if you read your tweeter feeds  the game is over you have been outed for the progressive you are
You killed far more soldiers than any Vietnamese did during the war you sorry POS!
I'm a POW, I'm a POW .... More like a POS! Your POW records will become unsealed eventually traitor!
nothing about you or anything you say is good news! You're a traitor to this country!
visiting your original country of betrayal! You are a traitor and you need to get out of Trumps way NOW!
Really, go back and get health care done and tax reform. As a Vietnam vet, I could care less.

Oh hey that just peachy! N KOREA RUSSIANS HEALTH CARE ......
Maybe they can find your'S
Luv mattis, and praying 4 u!
who do you think you are, McCain?  You no more represent the military than your constituents.   Neither group is proud to have you.
At least Hitler, who you seem to admire, fought in a war. Trump didn't do shit except stay and learn howvto bilk people from his daddy
You should go with and visit your old butties... 
If drump don't get us nuked before then
You're old friends huh @SenJohnMcCain?
May I suggest a long cruise for trump and blumenthal to visit and discuss their issues?
You gave them the info they wanted. Traitor!
Maybe @SenBlumenthal & @realDonaldTrump should ride along and show all the places that they were never at
Mad Dog backs Trump  BUT Keating 5 Juan doesn't  #traitor re North Korea  Nuke risk
As long as there is a next year!
Traitor
Hopefully, if Trump doesn't loose this one too!
Why are we investing billions on these sitting ducks.
How does that feel? Respects, Luv 2/2 + 1

Remember the disaster you caused on Forrestal? How many men did you kill that day with your incompetence?
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP #wednesdaymotivation #WednesdayWisdom @realDonaldTrump Would you please ask John, why are all his re-tweeters liberals?
That's a waste of money... unless they're taking you back and leaving you there
Oh good maybe your buddy @SenBlumenthal can tag along and make it to Vietnam finally 
No wet starts ok senator!
Aren't you suppose to be taking care of yourself...time to let go and retire a hero...
Why is it that Congress is exempt from Obamacare? It's so great wouldn't you want to be a part of it? Try Obamacare with cancer.

As long as you're not on it to start a fire by dropping the arsenal of a plane on deck. U R pathetic. Go away.
You have attracted the mean nasty wing of the Trumpets. Keep voting for the interest of the majority. Can't go wrong.

So you're going too? Thk it might be a bit risky with all the lies you told on their state radio? If you still had any sense maybe AVOID?
@FBI i see you have just started - are you doing anything illegal? being paid by Soros? SuperPacs?
US must not only maintain military position in Asia, its necessary to increase it to counter China/NK. Should do the same with trade.
Your grossly irresponsible in the way you speak against Pres Trump! The last 20 years of nice diplomacy has armed NK with nukes!
He knows exactly what he's doing. Idk how anyone can side w/ the establishment scum. Oh yeah, that's right they r all corrupt. Esp. U McCain
Go away when you can still walk away with some dignity. You are not to be trusted and I acknowledge it's probably not your fault.
#WednesdayWidsom #wednesdaymotivation look, one liberal after another retweeting for Lib-Johnny
Your shameful in the way you always stand against President Trump and the Republican Party! It's like you always need the attention!
Maybe you should hitch a one-way ride.
It would be nice to have americans go there. My fear is that since it's a communist country, they won't be the smartest. Similar to China
#WednesdayWisdom #wednesdaymotivation here is another liberal that retweets for McCain - are you being paid by Soros @FBI would like to know
Here's one Vietnam Vet who thinks this is a bad decision.
Trying to give them a carrier are you? Can't wait for the next AZ Senator to take office.
This is the problem with oversimplification- no one wants to be a client state, including to China.  Why persist in 20th century mythology?
You need to read this SEN McCain...you really really despicable:
In followup to statements from Pres Trump & Secy Tillerson, DefSec Mattis issues stark warning to North Korea: 
#trairorMcCain  evil globalist
Take John McCain with you.
There's an A4 Skyhawk ready for you Mister War so you can finish your "unfinished business" over there.
you mentioned great leaders you have known in previous tweets, are you including Ho Chi Minh?
Um, it's about 45 years too late, no?
please stop comparing Trump to any other president!!! We didnt want any other president who is all talk and no action.
This makes me very troubled and concerned...
Take the Pres...about time he went
Sen McCain,you're jealous that POTUS won the Presidency and you did not.Why don't you just become a Democrat as you resist him at every turn
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @rushlimbaugh @seanhannity @washingtonpost @NewYorker The Soros clan loves war. He makes money from the boss
Please we beg of you retire
Your own party member claims your brain tumor made you vote no  please explain to them that they are not looking out for Americans
you want to start a war one day the next day you don't you're just a bunch of blah blah blah blah blah

Also John McCain is a traitor to his constituents. 
SEN McCain
In followup to statements from Pres Trump & Secy Tillerson, DefSec Mattis issues stark warning to North Korea: 
Hopefully you will be out of office by then.
Talking is the only way forward. A good news story.
Great. But I am afraid one of your best friends is in trouble.

#Vietnam war criminal #AbuMcccain
"Lost" 1969 #Vietname

#JohnMcCain is war criminal and #AlQaeda backer @SenMikeLee @RoyBlunt 
â€¦
What the hell man? You know he made that recording after years of being a POW and torture? Every man has his breaking point.

When will you retire, Senator? You aren't working for us now.
Country over party buddy
Senator McCain certainly isn't working for the good of the country.
You are a danger to our country and need to step down.  #termlimits
I've been there in 2008!
Can we go war on Vietnam?
