@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for tweeting this out. One of the reasons my hubby and I,both Dems voted for you in 2008. Hubby's Viet Nam Disabled
Sad but #JohnMcCain doesn't support military or vets.
He works for Soros. http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/06/records-soros-fund-execs-funded-paul-ryan-marco-rubio-jeb-bush-john-mccain-john-kasich-lindsey-graham-in-2016/amp/ …

Plz understand ur article is what #McCain Said. But his true voting record is what I showed u. https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2015/05/14/senate-panel-pairs-military-retirement-reform-with-benefits-trim/ …
Many instances,the bills gets packed with "pet" legislation that becomes a stumbling block for lawmaker's.Noticed lots of Dems voted no,too
Last minute amendment was how #GMO scan got approved in a protect grass bill.

It's their damn country so they should defend it. What is so unique about defending you're own interest @SenJohnMcCain ?
Sen McCain, this president has put himself over everything this country stands for! Courts, congress, department of justice,
And the constitution... he has shown that he is a bigot and his rallies remind me of kkk rallies! We need strong leadership from our
Representatives.. especially from republicans who mostly are putting party over country!
I have been a republican all my life..
Agreed but proper vetting is essential.
I truly want to give them a big "thank you" for all they have done to help U.S. and allied troops, we will never forget the sacrifices made
I'm not going to read it because you suggested I do.
Save yourself for the Pussy Grabber Beth
What is wrong with you? Have you never said anything in private you regretted? Save the little humanity left in you.
Beth's an apologist for Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women. Only hope Beth never has daughters or daughters in law to explain to
At least I am not a parody of truth. No God blessed me with sons some of the finest humans I know. Nick take your fake outrage elsewhere.
Hope you raised your sons not to behave like your Dear Leader. What a role model you've introduced to them, a deviate lowlife BRAVO 
Let them move into your home John.
Time for you to give them one since you're responsible for this war in the first place. You should have thanked these people LONG AGO JOHNNY
Trumps doing a lot for vets. He's working to make the VA better. What did you do all those years? Go home in peace. You are blind to Reps.
So Johnny, where have you been all these years on this subject? I have never heard YOU say anything and YOU HELPED START this WAR! TWO FACED
Why are you aligned w the Post? They are extreme leftist media reporting fake news! Are you a devil in sheeps clothing? Hmmm...
He can't thank the people of Afghanistan. That would rub his racist heart the wrong way.
He wants to send troops to Afghanistan ... that doesn't sound racist to me ... the people of Afghanistan should be thanking us
That is such an elitist and entitled statement.  Are you expecting personalized thank yous too?
How's that elitist? I'm not in favor of going to Afghanistan but if Afghan want us and we go I don't think a "thank you" is out of line.
Wish you were President. God bless you.
#McCain & Hillary are owned by the same globalist that's why he didn't win. He tells u what u want 2 hear but votes the other way.

Sooo ... do they cheat off of each other #onevote #2018GOP #VoteThemOut2018 #VoteThemOut @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @GOP 

Yes sir. And they deserve a lot more than a thank you.

Mind boggling
Every Afghan vet I know (including 3tour soninlaw),thinks you are a #Traitor #Liar #DisgraceToAZ  don't pretend you give 2 $#¡+$ about them!
McCain proclaims himself  a “war hero” despite eyewitness testimony to the contrary. Very sad, even for a RINO!
@MeghanMcCain @ChrisSalcedoTX McCain like all RINOs, throws in a little bit of patriotic emotion 2 obscure his frequent irrational thinking.
You and Bo left the Dr that helped get bin laden rot in jail. Boy u really help wapo spread fake news don't you? Shame

#afghans worked for us and it was #covert and that is why #nothanks but #youneedtogetwellinthehead #mayoclinic not available #toall
Several Obama pardoned felons went right back to life of crime – But you RINOs r Worried about an 85 yr old patriot? Are u f'n kidding??!!
Are you working for the Wash Post?  Americans shed blood & fought this mans country.  He appears to be rewarded w/visa.  Thanks enough!
https://twitter.com/moekamerow/status/901534433424977922 …
Thanks for WHAT>>>>???  It's their damn country they're working for.
Not a word from U on Manning, or the Puerto Rico Nationalist terrorist pardoned......or the thousands of drug dealers pardoned by Obama.
Says the Songbird! Bet Japan thanked you! Traitor!
You're a RINO. Go back home and disappear. Bad for our party Jim
Thx to obama and the rest of you that spit in there face and tied their hands while doing their job. Blood is on you guys
Why aren't you thanking them?
It's the Washington Post same people who brought you Weapons of Mass Destruction-Stop making up stories Reason why
Well you have been a Senator for at least 3 decades , you think you could of did something to acknowledge them for the war YOU pushed for
Sir, I respect you immensely for your service to our nation. You blew it with Sarah Palin, but now you need to help get us out of this mess.
Shame on you, traitor! #Keating5 #InsaneMcCain
Stay home McCain!  Don't embarrass AZ any more!
Shut up Pat
Nothing from the Washington compost is must read. BTW why don't you just go ahead & become a democrat and get it over with? #Trump2020
Christy supports the pussy grabber
Agreed.
sure will read
John McCain is a Democrat! He hates our President! Thank my Son for his Marine Service..He was a Pilot. Is a empty person now.
Anyone of sound mind hates Trump
Hey let's talk about you blocking mia/pow searches in Vietnam. #SongbirdMcCain
WaPo and McCain...John you don't deserve the right to judge our President.  Your history proves you to be a coward.
John please go away
SPIN Fishing expedition @SenJohnMcCain ? Do something about it yourself. Put your actions ahead of your mouth. Failure 2 perform lies on U.
Hey, that was me tweeting that! Try to not suck ass your jobs in the future.
I outspied the entire planet...
Very sad.. We couldn't operate without them. Loyal country nationals have saved many lives in Iraq and Afghanistan......

McCAIN YOU MAKE US SICK ! TO DO OUR PRESIDENT THIS WAY !! UNDERMINING HIM
FAKE NEWS' SLANDERING'!
YOUR SLANDERING AMERICANS! VOTER'S
Traitor! Karma is coming for you VERY SOON

IT'S SO INSANE TO EQUATE MANNING TO SHERIFF ARPAIO,  it's only proof the  time for @SenJohnMcCain  to go home and stay there has come!
My nephew, Brandon, went into the USArmy straight out of hs.He went2Iraq &then to Afghanistan.The kid gave his life for this countryRIP
You are blood thirsty for loosing election of old. Your time to leave the Senate is past due.
probably the one thing we agree with.  Still, you fucked the US by lying.  Your personal feud with Pres is clouding your judgment.
I'm sorry you are so bitter. 
Give praise where it is do bravo .. But the other 85% of the country think its ok to cut ur head off for leaving islam
They certainly deserve our respect & appreciation - genuine heroes. Unlike you - superficial, scam artist, hypocritical zero
Wish you would feel the same way about American heroes, I notice you always bring up Afghanistan, maybe you should move there
Trumptard comment, shows depth of thought 
STICK THE WASHINGTON POST YOU KNOW WERE FAKE NEWS
Did u get your thank you from Japanese giving them 6 mo's of US flight plans during War?
Long Overdue 4 ALL. TRUMP Wall? Build a China Wall In Afgan & Train Their Army 2 Defend in a 2 State Country & GET OUT. War Tired, Cost Less
Unlike .@SenJohnMcCain #traitor SongBird & Soros puppet, @RealSheriffJoe is true hero https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/901276851561222144 … #MAGA #Arizona #Phoenix #DACA
.@POTUS's pardon of Joe Arpaio, who illegally profiled Latinos, undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=3B0E692D-FFEB-4F6C-ADF9-C3F598E94D2A …
You are correct, just as hx has forgotten those who served in VN another forgotten war
Quiet Please
Mr. McCain 
For reference, here is Trump railing on you in 2000 for not calling out Buchanan on Face the Nation.
TRUMP
2000 -blasts McCain & Dole for silence on Buchanan's 'repugnant' pro-Hitler views 
2017 -silent on #cville…
I think he's outnumbered by the American veterans down at the Vets hospital, yo know, you drive past it all the time -try stopping
And u won't. HC is his Nazi sibling Soros puppet.
McCain needs to go!!! 
Capt John is a true American hero. One doesn't have to s
hare political ideologies to respect the voicing of alternative positions
How can we help? Ready to serve you, Senator!
Wow president TRUMP just got 10 million more votes for 2020 hahahaha harharhar sink the Forestal
#draintheswamp #mccainmustgo
I thank them for their service in aiding our service men and women in war against evil and non-democracy. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
You are a traitor to this country, and should be behind bars! 
we agree it would b wrong if our country ignores w/these heroes sacrificed 4 our country when they put their lives on line 4 all even racist
And why should I thank an Afghani for protecting his own country? Get your senile shell of a man into retirement.
Thank you from the Tschopp family from the bottom of our hearts 
Wow you voted against so many veteran bills!
shameful
God bless u sir. I'm praying for your recovery. We need you. Signed, A Massachusetts liberal snowflake
If there weren't War Hawks like you would need to thank them Adolph
#ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #NeverthelessShePersisted #GuantanamoforTrump #EVIL  @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski  @nytimes @WSJ
Senator McCain, we already know how you despise OUR PRESIDENT ... we know what your agenda is the American people are watching your actions
Then help lead your party to the water trough on this Sen McCain...lead the way to making sure we live up to our promises & say thank you.
Trump must go he is ripping our country apart
This needs to end
Unfortunately this so called President does not have the brain to think something like that!!! So sad!!!
Yet more than u think.
Thank you to all that serve and have served our country!!
The Afghans, in general, are no different than the majority of people who currently run high tech industries in the Silicon Valley in U.S.
We have had a decade and a half of hero making in Afghanistan, and we are not even  close to winning. When will it be enough?
We have had some amazing students at Harvard Medical School who served in the Gulf, some of whom I had the privilege to mentor.
You mean we just used and abandoned them?

What a surprise.
Governments enact wars people fight them. Politicians should be forced to face the enemies they make. Unrealistic but a thought to vote on
They certainly aren't getting a thank you from @realDonaldTrump! He uses our military and soldiers as props. You know he could care less..
No one thanked me for my service, didn't serve for recognition, and didn't serve to chase hookers at tailhook parties.
You better start circling the wagons for the impeachment of 45 and table tax reform until the nazi is out of our WH
Sell out! Who cares about Afghanistan, you are irrelevant, what about the American people! SELL - OUT
No one reads the Washington Compost other than you and all your liberal cronies!!
Why haven't you apologized to Americans suffering under Yobamacare! You sir have failed America! Ur retiring so u don't even care.
WaPo is not an ethical news source, and neither are you.
Well I am sending them a great big
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND SACRIFICE AND SACRIFICE
For Heaven's Sake, Yes! Talk about "in harm's way." Gosh. And we could not do without them.
Are you saying you don't think WaPo is "Fake News"?
Senator, YOU have to power to push back against trump. You are respected in the Senate. Your words hold authority mine never will. #Impeach
Uhg
Awe! #Happy Saturday @washingtonpost I salute My Hero @SenJohnMcCain w/ The #Afghanistan #Heroes my life #inspiration #inspired me everyday
Fake News!!! POTUS thanks VETs everyday in some form. McCain is crying for attention after his Liberal decisions. POTUS don't need McCain.
Thank you for your bravery, sacrifice and Agree you all need to be given the reward of coming to U.S.
Never read that paper they screw with reality and always have. They did a story on my family in the 70s and screwed it up big time
We should Thank these Afganistan workers who risked their lives to help our troops, & deserve timely Visa's
When I see something that you want us to read I know not to. RETIRE enjoy the life you have left with family leave us patriots alone.
Change your party! You work for Dems

Good luck and best wishes with your current personal battle. Love from texas
When read anything recommended by this man he's a traitor to our country and a shame.
I was just reading somewhere that the reason the Afghanistan war hasn't been won is because of the opium trade.
Thank you for your service. You are a real American hero. Not always right haha, but none the less acting with integrity.
That's what they get for colluding with the enemy. History has shown tima and again the perils of doing such.
Sen. McCain's recent betrayal of what he campaigned for has nullified his political opinions. We no longer care what he thinks! Goodbye Sen.
Senator, please work with others in Senate and House to curtail
The wall
Threats of govt shutdown
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @CNN @nytimes @TheFive @rushlimbaugh @seanhannity the criminal code. The pardon power would provide for
Well go and thank them do your part
Bla bla
#ItWasTeleprompterTrump #thankyouSir #honestyneeded #keepgoing #DemocracyInPlay
We are beyond the D v R paradigm, the lib v conservative, we are facing an existential threat to our nation.
But John, the Afgans are Muslim so Trump would not like that idea. In any event, he is way too busy with things like pardoning Sheriff Joe!!
After the lousy way America has treated these translators I can't imagine why anyone would want to work with and help Amerucan soldiers.
Senator, @realDonaldTrump will be irritated with you reading REAL news.
Sir, do not forget the Iraqi terps that also helped us when we were there.
The man just pardoned a racist LEO whose contempt for the Bill of Rights matches his own. His contempt for constitution knows no bounds.
You KNOW he is the worst thing to happen to the country and your party. What are you waiting for?

#ImpeachTrumpNow #TrumpResign
Senator, my fervent hope is that you and other colleagues in Senate will continue to oppose #POTUS as he leads our nation into madness

Unless YOU work to get rid of trump these people will never be thank.He's not cold hearted.He's heartless. Will let them die in the streets.
Thank you!
Just wondering if that's your main news source? Maybe switch to the #WSJ for more "consistent" actual 'news'! Just a thought!
So why aren't you pressing your colleagues in Congress to begin impeachment proceedings?
So why aren't you pressing your colleagues in Congress to begin impeachment proceedings?

The man is a threat to EVERYTHING USA stands for
When will you stand with the constitution & American people & take ACTION? Your words are EMPTY unless you DO SOMETHING NOW

#ImpeachNow
Lord we ask that you heal John, Amen.  We also ask for him to have peace with Trump even if not reciprocated. Amen
We won't be able to do anything to help the world if you don't help save our country from Trump. I wish you well. Now help your country.
Please help this country's leadership. At this stage one would think you would. All else is drivel. #what really matters#disappointed
For all his bluster & impolitic comm., this pres. cares more about the U.S. then career politicians who refuse to step out of the box(swamp)
Retire John!
@SenJohnMcCain I am more and more impressed with you by the day.
Obviously your young and don't know McCain very well. He has two faces. Ask those he served with.
Are you referring to when he served in the House, or in the Senate? Which of the 7 terms? Or did you mean his time served in Vietnam?
You're the best! Please use your powers to get Trump impeached!
Your trump phobia needs treatment
He was railroaded big time!  He deserves the pardon granted by Pres. Trump.  Obama commuted sentences for felons.  Gitmo guys released, etc.
Thanking our military. 
Best @Potus.
#Obama legacy.
When are you going to open the POW files. Do you ever think about the people you killed in Vietnam ?
What about smericsns who lost life not getting thank you from Afghanistan or our govt.  war monger hypocrite
Are they doing for free?Once again Ur EXPOSING your TRUE colors FAVORING foreigners over American citizens.Your support for ILLEGAL is SICK!
"@SenJohnMcCain: Must-read  "The #Afghanistan heroes who haven’t even gotten a thank-you"
http://wapo.st/2gc00ik  @realDonaldTrump
I'm sorry did you think your opinion mattered. It doesn't , so shut up YOU are not the President.
@SenJohnMcCain Just think of the great Obama health care system you have given the families of our real heroes John you failed us
Pardon by Nixon for treason against America never speak about military again! History hidden from America
Thank you Sen. McCain 
#RiseUp 
Campaign platform - Repeal and Replace ...keeps promises just like Obama....keep your doctor & hospital, reduce premiums by $2500
You were just on TV claiming we were losing the war in Afghanistan. Way to show your thanks John.
One vote McCain... shame on you
Very thankful for his one vote. Were you rooting for taking healthcare away for millions and waking it for everyone else?
Poor Deb CNN is not good  4 you. I'm for healthcare for all Americans. There are so many states without health care because of failing ACA.
How did CNN even come into the discussion? I'm guessing you're a Trump supporter that has nightmares about it?
ACA isn't failing. It's doing just fine. It's not a magic bullet and will have its upside and downs. It needs to be improved, not repealed
ACA has given millions of people healthcare - through Medicaid expansion and exchanges. Why not see how that can be made better?
Why do you want to take away healthcare from people? Some big insurance companies pulled out of ACA bcos they were denied mergers.
Any other issues apart from that?
How shameful can a president be allowed to be???
Did you ever thank Sheriff Joe for doing the lords work in Arizona? I hope you live forever John
YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT AMERICANS OR PPL OF ARIZONA ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS FOREIGN PEOPLE NOT AMERICANS JUST LOOK AT THAT HEALTHCARE VOTE CREEP
Spoken like a coward with bone spurs on his foot.
@PostOpinions thank you for your leadership and service Sir.
2019 it will be possible for americans born after the war in Afghanistan started.. to actually participate in the war in Afghanistan
Very good read.
Get out of my Senate you lying, treasonous, despicable weasel

Lame
