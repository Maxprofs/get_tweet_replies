The multimillionaire public servant
Does he even know his state, AZ, is one state with no choice of healthcare providers and doubling insurance rates?
You and @JohnKerry are both fuckin Traitors! #GTFO
Sir I hope you watched it before you endorse it.
Well at least you don't hide anymore hanging out with Obama's inner circle. Guitar guy was there singing You Got a Friend in Me?
Would have been nice to watch you better healthcare

I love Ken Burns' Civil War and Prohibition docs, this one will be great and I'm glad you were there.
Traitor then, traitor now...
Odd reps for Vietnam doc.  Two guys who didn't exactly follow protocol. Oh well, it's not who your ARE, it's who you KNOW.
Why was Kerry there considering the fact about this subject??
Are you serious?
Ken burns is he only good guy in the photo. The two John's are not good people as they have enriched themselves not only by squandering our nations wealth but by fiscal fraud and deceit

You should stand up to those swift boaters & tell this country how sick the GOP is. That's when the "deplorables" went in the gutter first.
You could have had billions for the military if the ACA was repealed and mandates gone...
Beats working, huh?
