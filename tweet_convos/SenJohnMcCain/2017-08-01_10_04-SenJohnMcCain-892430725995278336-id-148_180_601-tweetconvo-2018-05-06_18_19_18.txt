No hero
Russia Russia Russia all lies smoking mirror by The Establishment rhinos and liberals we are not stupid traitor McCain
Actually it is the Dems that put together the false documents
This is Trumps agenda!
You are a traitor not only to the Vietnam veterans but America. You are a Obama sympathizer & will be a sad day when you stand before Christ
Nobody backs McCain.
Who is the greater hero to the American people?
My God Who Art in Heaven his name is Jesus Christ he said if my children would repent & turn from their ways he would make #MAGA thanks DJT
You won't live to see another term in the Senate and neither will your clone Jeff Flake. AZ people have had enough of your lies, Soros lover
I'm sure he's thrilled to get your approval. 
Lying conman phony crook just like @POTUS Impeach both asap @DRUDGE_REPORT @SenDeanHeller @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain #spinelesscrooks
... John McCain is a stooge for globalist bankers.
You're my favs
US loves to eat from its generous hand beggars and panhandlers all over the world.
That's because congress is in a world by themselves. They think they're better than everyone else. They're a joke.
Ye they are joke. But because their joke our countries can be turned on to crematorian dust, and it will be sad
Where is POTUS sign on sanctions? Why is he delaying?!
Pipe down Benedict McCain, we are not interested in what you have say!
#KeepYourPromise or #resign
Americans talk about Russians as if they are devils
I think America is the real Demons
Just go to hospice now. You suck at life
The battered and cowardly pilot is indignant?
Oooohhh sooo now your a little cheerleader for the real republicans.
Sneaky sneaky American undermining EU plans .... sneaky scheming . So far for "allies" ... I hope I'm wrong.
what
@SenJohnMcCain @VP Both Georgia and Ukraine must be in NATO. Both nations want it. US is a superpower! Why should you listen to Russia?!
To be panhandler and beggar country its a destiny of ukraine


No one care what you think McCain
Democractic celebrities are glad to see McCain is back...that should tell you everything you need to know...
...acknowledging the new administration…
#ImpeachTrumpNow
#25thAmendmentNow

You were certainly a War Hero, and I as a veteran,applaud You. But you have turned out to be a traitor to the citizens of the USA
Just a traitor to the middle class, basically the Republican base
Frack off back stabbing traitor!
What about South Carolina
Pence was involved in the Russian collusion. Why do you openly support Russian agents?
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! We love you Georgia!
Unfortunately Trump still thinks it is a US State trying to get into NATO.
He's not the president, just a stuffed shirt that spews the lies this admin instructs him to.  Why u still believe anything this admin says?
Many Mafia figures in Georgia.  Criminals right and left.   Not box Russia in a corner
  Didn't Georgia throw out our back Pres there?
Stop .......you have lost the right to say anything concerning this administration . You made your bed now lay in it and shut up
But what does the president say?
He's already acting "presidential". It's cute to keep pretending that he's keeping the "vice" on his job title

Now Trump needs actions not words. Show me don't tell me.
And Trump says...nothing.
Shame you can't back your own party and base like you support every tin horn country on your private list.
And a Shout of of Thanks to you @SenJohnMcCain on your thumbs down on repeal and replace Otrauma Care, TRAITOR
Thank you for your vote against the Trumpcare/RepubliCare bill
Сон я видел. Помреш ты скоро старая калоша...
Yes, pence is practicing his Presidential posture. It is only a matter of time before trump is de-throned
McCain gnashes his teeth. Yells in a voice that resembles Nixon: "War! War!!! WAAAAR!!!!"
Seem weird to have GREAT JOB and PENCE in the same sentence. Highly unlikely.
When will @potus sign the sanctions bill ??
We dont care what you think traitor
Quit, retire, fade away...you have started more wars than anyone in US history. Disgusting.
We're voting you out!  We want Trumps agenda, not yours.  Not a team player.  How much of the Medicaid extension does your state benefit?
hear, hear!
McCain You will not live to see this day......
Thank you senator McCain being responsible for the many many instabilities/conflicts around the . Keep it up "maverick"
Sneaky POLITICIAN doublespeak. Complement to VP Pence ok but notice , passing over @POTUS who backs his trip. McCain smallish in a big seat.
mccain 0.0%
Why hasn't Trump signed the sanction bill yet
Thank you for your friendship and undeterred support for Georgia.
The gentleman мсcain from your mouth pours the bile, soon you'd be choking
45 and Pencw know that's the country right; not the southern state?  Just checking
Amazing reading these replies 2 u Senator McCain. Almost all are Libs or Dems praising you or saying they still don't trust you. #DemsHCHero
That's good because DJT thinks it's downsouth...

Yoir opinion doesn't matter. Use the VA for healthcare
Umm job where he read words but reality is POTUS cowardly does putin bidding
Vote for a repeal and replace . Do your job!
Who should believe that ?
The president dont even know, what the NATO is.
Eww ... your on my TL bcz "you're somebody I used to know" buh bye @SenJohnMcCain
cannot say the same of you doing what's right in DC. 
damn closet democrat & never Trumper .  very sad.
Dear Senator McCain your courageous vote against "skinny" Trumpcare will save many lives, possibly my own. I will always be grateful.
Obummercare will implode on its own anyway so there really is no winners.
Nothing @VP does will rectify his willing collusion with Trump and every despicable thing he stood for. #NoIntegrity
So, maybe this should be addressed to Trump, who has done nothing of the kind, instead of Pence, who CANNOT do anything of the kind!
When are you going to keep your promise and repeal Obamacare? You lied
Did he ask @realDonaldTrump before he said all that?. He seems to have different message or more like not one at all. He's a bit silent.
Seems like @SenJohnMcCain is confusing stubborn & difficult for brave & maverick. 
I don't ever hear him called intelligent or wise.
@VP DOES NOT SPEAK FOR THE PRESIDENT!!!!!!
Shutup traitor McCain
Yes great job to the VP regarding Georgia joining NATO. Now Senator McCain if he could only convince you to rejoin the GOP...
US в своей русофобской маниакальной шизофренической доктриной закрывают себе продуктивную дорогу в будущее,искусственно создавая себе врагов
Repubs blowing the opportunity of a lifetime to turn back the leftisr influence on edu,  govt, news, arts, & You're preaching ignore radio.
If your boss has his way in 7 years we'll be arguing about the Russian occupation of another Georgia. 
#PutinOutOfAtlanta!
Just words. 
YOUR VOTE AGAINST CONFERENCE ON HEALTH CARE WAS WRONG!  YOU ARE A TRAITOR TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @krauthammer
Waiting for the tweet from @realDonaldTrump announcing @IvankaTrump as new @VP
You'd love another war wouldn't you John?
Russia drives former republics to NATO with interference and invasions..they need to chill and support free trade and cooperation
RETIRE! MCVAIN! CORRUPT OLD BAT!
Fair enough, but what EXACTLY is the policy?  Refer to @Heritage  conference in Fall where NATO-like guarantees would be provided.
McCain to resign immidietey to take care brain #startupday #MenTellAll #NationalGirlfriendDay #Emily #NationalNightOut2017 #Trump #edtech
I don't know a lot here, but have some concerns about crowding Russia.
John, why're you so oblivious to children in Yemen? He's just like anyone's grandson. Why's he suffering for political reasons?
Would you illuminate why Merkel/EU want EU alignment vs Nato alignment?
Why isn't John McCain using the VA for his health care?
Maybe the VA doesn't like hero's that were captured. 
That's what you say now. If it comes up for any vote, I know you will vote thumbs down.
Ya...but what does trump say and will he back up what he says? Oh...and when will he sign those Russia sanctions?
Go back to getting better!!
Chemo sucks and radiation makes me tired, get better!
That's an order!
Russia is trying to occupy South Ossetia and Abkhazia by attaching it to itself
HOW about letting the American people know what is going on its our country too.
Pence lies like trump he is no good guy
Obama didn't
Wow! I didn't realize that the Russians are in Georgia! I hope Atlanta will be OK they all voted for me.  Sherman or Putin through Atlanta?
Come on, Dude! This is the country of Georgia! Surely you knew that. Right?
Why hasn't @POTUS signed as sanctions bill yet!!!????
#SignSanctionsBill I am praying for you, Senator
Please stop @SenJohnMcCain.  Your only job is to REPEAL ACA.
Since Senator McCain is head of the Senate Armed Services Committee I am pretty sure that this is a lot more important to him than the ACA.
But, POTUS hasn't yet signed the Sanctions bill. Should we be concerned that there is something he can do to avoid signing it?
Does @realDonaldTrump know? I hope so or hes going to have alot of explaining to do next time the @RusEmbUSA visits the @WhiteHouse
He too cannot be trusted. When Pence takes over, he will be reined in & will be watched like a hawk by the people of America. #TheResistance

Pence is just polishing his own topedo to take over from crazy tRump.
Senator...could you check in with WH and ask why Russian sanctions bill has not been signed?
..which should be a normal thing and not even worth a mention.
Looks loke Pence is prepping for 25th Amendment.
#IPreferPence
Where is Tillerson?

Still waiting on those Russian sanctions to be signed...
The following is a joke. 

Why would a state want to join NATO?
Are you kidding doing or do you not know Georgia is a country?
I did put "the following is a joke" before writing that, lady.
And most likely, over trump's objection as well.  Seriously we need trump removed now!
Not if he is removed legally  Back with your speaking for a group as if they all agree with, I see
