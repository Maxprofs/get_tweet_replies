Let me know the law to negotiate extremist terrorists in your country.
good job MR. SENATOR, Respect from Pakistan for doing this step for sake of humanity.
In case you forgot, you are not the President.
Trump 2020.
Sen McCain, Your compassion is what America is about! We love you.
TN, you might want to begin to disassociate from Trump about now.
I was sure Obama would be mentioned in that description.

Lame stream media.
I recommend a book by @TimothySnyder, YALE  prof called "On Tyranny."
Yes. We know Yale produces free thinkers unburdened by socialist indoctrination. Right.
Sir, take some time to read it; let's have a real debate with knowledge. These parroted opinions provide no facts. Educate me.
What about our healthcare john?
Never let terrorist into your country
Human rights are for those who act humanly towards others.
A pakistani islamist group is sponsering the torture and killing of buddist in Myanmar. You noticed?
you are among few world politicians of int. repute who listens to his conscience than being politically correct by following party line.
I'll bet you'd like to start a war there, wouldn't you?
BOOM, you know it's true. 
Same thing will happen there https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/asia_pacific/a-disaster-in-the-making-pakistans-population-has-more-than-doubled-in-20-years/2017/09/08/4f434c58-926b-11e7-8482-8dc9a7af29f9_story.html …
Thank you so much
Sent aa letter to your master Muslim manipulators and fake Rohingers to stop robbing , rapping and harassing Burmese-Rakhaine people.
Yes. We hope you will have inquiry about our #Rakhine people and ARSA terrorist group’s attacks.

Urging Suu Kyi is pointless. Stronger measure is required .
Yeah, kill Suu Kyi and all Burmese-Buddhists, then elect all Rohingas as US congratpersons and Senators so that guys like you could sleep.
That's great, but no one cares right now because you, the dems and the globalist are trying to tear down America.
You mean the rest of the world but the 30% of trump supporters. I think you are delusional as most in the GOP.
Including you.
do not be a terrorist supporter by oppressing good people.
Thank you Senator
Very important and much needed for leaders across the World to speak out on these atrocities
Little knowledge and zero empathy toward real Burmese people creates a big hippocret loike you who acts on bubbles not depth of othe ocean.

Pls kindly view that, how Myanmar Military Medical team treat Bengali,Muslim people who want to stay peacefully together with local people. 
#RakhineState is being attacked by extremist terrorists (illegal occupied). They insult our country very badly.
U don't need to urge ASSK to adhere human right.What she is doing now is taking the terrorist into justice b4 they put their root in Myanmar
Thank you.
Thanks @SenJohnMcCain
Thanks sen McCain

Thank you
she's a disgrace & you shouldn't have 2 send her a letter if she was the person she pretends to http://be.now  unmasked as a fraud
SONGBIRD TRASH
Thank you!
You are just wasting your time.   These people don't respect anything.
Wish you would write a letter to Australia, have you heard of our refugee gulags?
My question is, Is it fair to be attacked or killed for what he or she believe ???
Mr McCain Sir, 95/5 Bangalies to our ethnic Arakan Sir.At the fence of Bangaladash
The US has lost the right to criticize human rights violations
You could also threaten military intervention as you always do in the Middle East.
Did she send one back urging US to do the same?
Sad that world have turned blind eye
What about the atrocities you committed?  Singing like a bird in the Hanoi Hilton, aiding ISIS, Keating 5, Gang 8, and Obamacare.  Treason!!
Figured you'd write a letter whining about Trump. That seems to be all you're good for these days. #EconomicGlobalistIdiots
How about imposing sanctions on her and the military junta
#MAGA #draintheswamp #mccainmustgo
Crazy how many Dems follow him.
With all of your letter writing and appearances on liberal media, it's no wonder you don't listen to the majority who don't share your views
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain. Letter calls for violations in Rakhine to stop and for Suu Kyi to find her voice and cooperate w UN fact finders.
Why don't you retire and go there to see they are adhering to your request.
Sir you are taking the right steps stop state terror which will attract terrorist and that is what modi want to show muslims are terrorist .
And you're supporting repeal of ACA
urgent save Rohingya
What about one to Saudi Arabia for the atrocities committed against innocent people in Yemen?! Oh wait, that doesn't serve US interests...
a principled voice in an unprincipled world.

they burn their houses and claims the world that Myanmar army is doing so that they can get help.
Thank you Senator McCain
We were not robot don't try to put the program.the cool is enough already for all of our people.we got our right for our Nation.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. #Rohingya
John McCain 
You should urge all Muslim not to belive in Alha and follow the teaching of Mohermat which make them to do gross atrocities.
So glad, but how about here at home. Please defend DACA!
He'll defend anything for a price. Even the sacking of America.  How do you defend something that is immoral, illogical, and illegal?
Instead, please urge Trump to adhere to human rights! Healthcare, dreamers....
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain #RohingyaGenocide #RohingyaMuslims Murdered by #Burmese Military
Bangalis burnt their own houses and fled back to their native place.
Does your country accept the illegal invaders ?Most Rohingyas come from Bangaladesh.They create crisis.They fought police stations n killed.
Her Nobel Prize should be revoked for her inaction & silence over the massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Burma.
Maybe they shouldn't try and implement Sharia on people who don't want it.  That doesn't matter to people in a death cult though.
Thank you!!
We miss you.
We myanmar are not genociding them.last five years ago bangali so called rohingya are 70% of population in that reagion.but now they are 92%
So glad that someone is acting like a President. @realDonaldTrump wouldn't know what to do. Thank you for your service from this Democrat.

You organized terrorist cells within Syria to combat supposed HR violations against Assad & send a F-ing letter to Aung Kyi?!
Please support our President, sir. He's not a real Rep. or Dem. , so both can take the credit! Present it to Pelosi.
Her reply: Start at home.
Hey, got one or two ISSUES of our own that could lead to massive death, fix THOSE & we can assist others
Can't even utter the word "Muslim" in fear of your Zionist masters. FYI Israel is arming the Myanmar military and refuses to stop. #disgrace
Good, but what about human rights violations in US? #SaveDACA #Dreamers
thank you Senator. I'm glad someone in Congress is paying attention. This situation is heartbreaking.
Let's start in the USA first! Every single day "45" is stripping away Americans rights and dignity. USA's monster Potus!
Writing a letter won't do jack..... You need president Trumpestein to take action.. Oh wait he won't because Muslims r being murdered.
Thank you!
Does Nobel committee have award for hypocrisy?
sir, Thank You so much for your concern. #AungSanSuuKyi hailed as a #HumanRights fighter, she is now letting the same happen to #Rohingyas 
If u can send armies to Iraq/Afghanistan/etc, where there were no similar atrocities, u can very well send those same men 2 save Rohingya.
Well said

When will you start working for Veterans of America? You disappointed us by being a democrat. Did Soros pad your pockets to vote no? U hide.
Oh, you are so brave, NOT
Letters , because there is no oil there

Bengali so called #Rohingya their plan #Terrorist #Burma #Arakhan #Rakhine #Myanmar https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156096947091490&id=713831489 … 
Im sure that will fix everything
Did you ever send such a letter to @BarackObama the "Nobel Peace Prize" winner?
Senator McCain: a true American! God bless. 
You should have been president!
Try sending the same letter to Washington. Address it to tRump.
why? she is constitutional barred form presidency...wasted a stamp
Thank you senator!
A letter? Hard work after your (vacation) work trip to Italy. #lazyCongress do something for America.
We probably shouldn't lecture anyone on 'human rights', right now.  Line the busses up!
You'd be more credible if your party & @POTUS were actual leaders on human rights: transgender ban, refugee ban, voting rights, #DACA, etc





Mr.McCain,No one wants to live together with Terrorist.Come to http://myanmar.You  can see real world.real world is different from media
I'm reporting you for posting propaganda that is also "death porn". Despicable.
Thank you for addressing the horrific situation in Burma. It's sad that the US's moral authority is being eroded by the current US president
You know nothing of moral authority!!  If you want a welfare state go to Sweden!
Open your eyes wide and look for the truth.
you may want to try the same thing with your boss. try not to use too many big words
@jaketapper :
Thank you, Senator McCain, for stepping into our nation's leadership void.
Good.  Can you do a little more here and abroad.  Firm tweets and letters are a good start
Retire, please!!!!
Thank you for speaking out against #RohingyaGenocide in #Burma. We need more world leaders to put pressure on @OfficialSuuKyi & Burmese gov!
If you know real truth information what is happening in rakhine state in myanmar,i hope you will never say #Rohinger Genocide cuase nowadayi
Send a letter to Donald Trump, while you're at it.
