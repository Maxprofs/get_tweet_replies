The #JonesAct is a form of embargo against Americans by the US government. Why are we keeping it 70yrs later?
*97 years later.
I stand corrected.
It has its purpose, though. It provides national security from US Port to US Port for US trade. Needs an update, not a repeal. #JonesAct
Yeah, when there was a danger of uboats 97yrs ago. When was the last time ships got attacked by submarines in the Caribbean?

Haha, lets not fix the "exploitation of maritime practices", but instead make sure goods in Puerto Rico cost double. That will teach em.
Yes, if they want it!
What do you think the delay is about?  Leverage the local holdouts on statehood more likely.
Don’t be so cynical. Trump just hasn’t a clue....
Tongue in cheek...... How could one be more cynical than to say Trump hasn’t a clue!

It's more like 10,000 now, roads are impassable at this point
don't care about any act..These r ppl.stop being rich try Benevolence,charity.this could b ur Family
Can we please do something for PR? It's heartbreaking watching them beg for help. Please help them I know you care
False narrative, over 8,000 containers at port. 5mill Ltrs water, 4Mill MRE. Gasoline all ready. Not a supply problem
Follow the money' somehow it ties back to Trump or one of his big $$ donors.

as ppl r helping plz also install small solar panels by stop lights.,just start solar
No it's not. They need truck drivers and cleared roads. The stuff is on the dock.
Please have Congress fix the ports.  Foreign ships may come but they can't berth. Massive port damage.
Time to eliminate the permanent damage, eliminating shipping dispositions in Jones Act. @chrislhayes @HispanicCaucus @thehill @repjohnlewis
Stop to kissing the MSM and start to serving the American people. You and graham out of the congress in 2018. I stand for  people
If you hadn't had little miss "I can see Russia from my house" ,you would have been president
This was dishonest. We, the American people, are tired of yoru personal feud with Trump on our time and money. Retire, then feud all you want.
In survival situations rules get set aside. These people are at risk of dying from dehydration. We treat prisoners better people!
Agreed Senator #PuertoRicans are paying for a law that takes money out of their empty pockets and gifts it to mariners & union officials
Oh no there's a real smart person2listen too,McTraitor McCain! You2belong together
@POTUS WAIVED this #JonesAct for #PuertoRico.  @SenJohnMcCain stop spreading LIES!!
No offense but appears you can't make reasonable decisions for the people so PLEASE do us a favor. Stand down as Senator. You let us down!
Does McCain even realize how badly he's allowed out military to become?  Robbing parts from old planes to fix others!  And you claim to be
A Veteran?
10 days not enough revoqué this for good to help PR economy and survival
AllUScitizens must Pressure all levels of PublicServants:President&CongressEtc: OurServants 2 b 4 CareOfPlanetLifePeople:2StopUnjustJonesAct
Out of the senate 
This old bastard should have died!
Abolish the Jones Act!
From now on presidents should be forced to live in these disaster areas until aid reaches them.
@POTUS RESCIND THE JONES ACT NOW
Waiving it is not enough, USA should repeal the #JonesAct for Puerto Rico &USVI. The islands needs all the help they can get to stabilize
Thanks Senator,4getting that http://waiver.Now  work on getting choppers 2deliver that Cargo.It's just sitting not being distributed
Jones Act aside (for the moment), what is happening to get the thousands of containers already there off the pier & to the ppl?
#Trump took so long to lift the Jones Act, because he wasn't sure if Obama inacted it or not. Lol

#PuertoRico #PuertoRicoRelief #JonesAct Thank You 
Thank you Sen. McCain. It appears the president read your tweet & may have acted to help Puerto Rico
DJT passed it.. I think, in part, due to this tidbit being found out
Why does trump seem to have a problem w/ Puerto Rico's debt? $33M of that debt came from his failed PR golf course.
While you were sleeping John, @POTUS has been working!! Jones Act has been waived!!! Maybe now you will stop your constant negative tone!
Fake senile news
Will you start impeachment hearings on that SOB? What are you waiting for?
Because a bunch of money grubbing idiots are in White House, and brown people live there which trump gives zero f**** about
It's because Trump hates Puerto Rican's & wants them to die. Is that what you're saying you bitter old petulant creep?
Sheesh, can't it be bypassed in this instance?
It was for Houston  Puerto Rico is full of brown people... bad optics for white house - looks like race IS an issue. #NotMyPresident 
The jones act is crime against basic humanity!
Isn't that amazing, our immigration act hasn't slowed congess one bit about not enforcing those laws. #partyb4country
Hey gotta take care of the shipping owners before human lives, esp ones that can't vote 4 Pres. 
@realDonaldTrump Your actions against Puerto Rico are preposterous!Get a dictionary and look up the meaning #Idiot #Karma #youwillbegonesoon
McCain is out of touch! There are 3000 containers full of supplies in PR"s port, no drivers to distribute! #JonesAct is not the delay.
No, sir. It is being delayed by the deranged #Dotard in the WH. #JonesAct was waived for Houston & Florida. But not for Puerto Rico. Why?
Life the #JonesAct, it’s been lifted for other disaster struck areas, in Florida up to a week before! Use your influence sir!
It's time to REPEAL the JONES ACT
Good idea Senator McCain!
Thank you. I hope you can talk some other GOP Into helping you. .@marcorubio .@LindseyGrahamSC .@DeanHeller  ???
Good health care for Americans is being delayed by you! John Mc Caine!
Ridiculous!
Help for teachers and students your home state are being delayed!
How about taking care of your constituents first and then branch out?
Can Congress do something about it?
What happened to common sense to help others in need?  People that greedy that they have to make $ first before help like a lot of doctors?
Senator I applaud your efforts to push @realDonaldTrump along, but I honestly don't think he even knows Puerto Rico is part of the US.
Why does it always take people dying for other people to realize they needed to do something then repeat same mistake later again & again?
Help for #PuertoRico is being delayed by @POTUS
please help the Puerto Rican people. #TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Are they taking instructions from Mitch McConnell's shipping magnate father-in-law? Is he in charge of policy now?
Russia will be there before Trump
..
Can we help persuade people that wish to #TakeAKnee to send aid to PR to be patriotic and simultaneously fight racism?
Tell me now John,
Is Trump a racist?

Seriously.....
Thank you Sen. JM---- stay in the fight--- and shoulders back and clear eyes!
I simply cannot wrap my mind around this. People in need, people who are our people.... and once again, a circus. 

#impeachment
Thank you for all your help Senator John McCain.
Really John? Do they have enough dock space in their ports, or are you again taking swipes of jealousy at Trump?
You are an active government employee, I nominate you to take over as potus for the remainder of this term. No trump no pence no ryan etc
That is pathetic! If it was Alabama it wouldn't be excuses or delays! PR don't welcome Trump!He is not God!!! NFL or PR?  DJT is an idiot!
Disgusted with this president...he's THINKING ABOUT IT??? #DEPLORABLE
I honestly love @SenJohnMcCain. Thank you for fighting for basic rights and not just for PR.
Dont forgetn incompetent Top Dog who tweets all weekend about his brand of patriotism attacks the 1st Amendment ignores Puerto Rico.
Shameful...
Waived for Texas & Florida... difference between mainland and Puerto Rico?? Can only imagine personal petty vendetta Bankruptcy of golf club
What the...
For gods sakes America is better than this! We've always been better than this, until Trump! This is disgusting & a disgrace to our country!

Trump needs to be brought up on criminal charges. This is reckless endangerment against americans citizens. He has no humanity
We see you, Sir. #JohnMcCain #HeServedHisCountry #JonesAct
POTUS didn't even know PuertoRico was American had to tell everyone it was surrounded by water. If these ppl were white they'd get help fast
I highly suggest u stop watching extra innings baseball... might screw up ur thought process #FindingMYself
Who can waive it? Trumpy... does he want too ...
I wish trump would defer.to your judgement
which trumpinfuher could get past if he wanted to.which he doesnt
I respect you Senator and I hate to correct you but help for PR is being delayed because of #Trump
I hope the people of Puerto Rico know how hard some of us are trying to get help to them.
I will help PR- but not cuz u asked!! U traitor!!
All branches of the military can be activated to rescue my people of Puerto Rico. Many supplies got there but the resources are lacking.
@realDonaldTrump Please lift the Jones Act, at least for now!! Let's get these supplies to Puerto Rico ASAP!! Please?!!
You've been working on this repeal a long time. Hope it finally gains some ground!
Get this ass of a @POTUS to Send help
over 350k + people agree with you, help keep the momentum up
Where is your project derogating this ancient colonial law? If you don't push a project, you are just pandering. Prove me wrong, I dare you.
Thank you Sen McCain for your unwavering good sense & loyalty to the true values of this country.  I'm a Democrat, grateful for your service
#Ethics: Trump OK #JonesAct waiver: FlL-Marlago, LA-Trump Int. Hotel, TX-Oil?Tillerson - #PuertoRico waiver NO. Lost lives accountability?
I can't thank you enough for your voice and awareness to this and all us crisis .Thank you sir you are the better man
Sign the petition https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/thank-you/2591581 …
Thanks Senator time is of the essence--all hands on deck#unidosporpuertorico

don't let him keep congress out of PR!!!!! he will not authorize travel until after he goes on tuesday. help those Americans John!
Could PR be his Road to Damascus or is this dictator/devil just sunk forever?
this is not true.  we have the ships and planes to get supplies to P.R. choosing not to-to use a disaster to further a political goal. shame
Do away with the Jones Act permanently. Hampers competition and raises costs.
3of 3 helicopter rescues like we saw in Harvey? Why no repair teams disbursed? This inadequate response would never be acceptable in Con. US

Why can't we airlift supplies and MREs bottled water. Planes are faster than ships
@timkaine & @SenJohnMcCain  lets get this done! No reason to have #JonesAct, save PR.
Screwed PR over for centuries now.
This is what occupation looks like.
Tax us, make us fight in your eenseless wars then fuck us!
Talk so much shit claiming we matter.
Claiming people matter.
The only thing rhat matter is money.
Set PR free! Shit deald are for the dead
La gente de utuado estan el olvido help!! https://www.facebook.com/angelrolorios/videos/10155070904071909/ …
So what are we doing about it?
2 of 3 @SenJohnMcCain-When things were really bad during Katrina it didn't get better until the military showed up.  Why aren't we seeing...
Thank you McCain for putting pressure on #JonesAct  
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for caring and standing w/ PR in their time of die need.  Pls fight for the military & logistic experts to go to PR
What a dumb ass statement. McCain is spreading fake news to increase his standing in the Heritage Foundation...what a heroic act!
Jones Act fact & why its not the prob. Goods have been shipped & more can be, there is no infrastructure to deliver
Our government does not care about brown Americans.
Time to suspend Jones Act until PR residents are safe!
Thank you Senator McCain for all you do. Please get help for our fellow citizens in PuertoRico
It must be people must die act Senator. It is terrible people have to go through this. Change this and call it disaster relief act simple
3,000 full shipping containers sitting on docks in Puerto Rico right now and not moving! No trucks, no drivers. More ships won't fix this!
ENOUGH TRUMP
BLAMING THE VICTIM MONSTROUS!
AS PRES. YOUR JOB IS TO RESPOND
TO ALL VICTIMS NOT JUST WHITE
AMERICANS
HIS HATE,RACISM'S SHOWING
What about the supplies sitting in containers at Puerto Rican ports? Why don't you do anything about that Senator?
Gee, if only you knew somebody in a government institution that could change that archaic law, like maybe, you know, THE SENATE???
Well, mostly being delayed by Trump .
AIR DROP WITH HELICOPTERS AND SMALL PLANES. HOW SMART DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO FIGURE THAT OUT. YOU PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSE TO BE SMART! THINK A PIT.
But jackass said everything was going great? What gives?
If McCain knew the facts, he is a fool, it's not about quantity it's about distribution on the ground, McCain needs to retire, HEADLINE JOHN
“The limitation is going to be port capacity to offload and transit, not vessel availability.”
Hey John tell us about your involvement in the fraudulent KEATING 5 SCANDAL how you skateed, a HERO would of done the time for the crime
Thank you Senator McCain.
#KillJonesAct
There are 3000 shipping containers sitting I. Port with no trucks or manpower to unload them. You should "follow" David Bregnaud, reporter.
First off the shipping industry does not want it lifted so PR Governor And Mayor of San Juan has a lot to do with this and the decision
Why cant the army air drop food and water to people until roads are cleared.
@realDonaldTrump This is crazy. How can Trump do this ? They have no water, food or medical supplies. 
Not according to the Govenor.
Please pass an energency aid package with temporary Jones Act waivers RIGHT AWAY! LIVES ARE ON THE LINE!
Do something about it,  people are dying
what about the millions of americans' healthcare.  u do nothing but divide and obstruct.  what r u doing about the jones act, john?  crying.
FUCK THE #JONESACT .
Impeach this man who continues to attack Americans everyday. He attacks Americans.
Its Time 
#PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow
Support the Jones Act now!
What’s really sad is these American soldiers while in despair still helping their own. Oh, their Puerto Rican’s.
This is why the US mainland has a responsibility to help.
But yet we have to go to war at the strike of a pen huh...#PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoReliefNOW #PuertoRicoStrong
Answer the question, is there a shortage of vessels to get aid to PR? If not, non-issue, if so POTUS & Congress get it out of the way to PR!
Impeachment is also being delayed. This is for no reason. So gotta conclude its from malice and discrimination. Its time to impeach #Trump
Does this stupidity surprise anyone ?
How much are u being paid by democrats
Maritime officials are disputing
Cancel the Jones act ,that was created during a different era. It has been hurting Puerto Rico for ever
Duh
he lifted it to help Texas & Florida should have for Puerto Rico too! potus45 putting shipping before American lives
How can we help, Senator?
People die while Jones Act lives?  Sen McCain, you are one of the very few senators who can say they are pro-life.  Bless you
Your new cause John? Didn’t do shit for PR entire time in office, but now you open your dead heart
And what can you do about that. You seem to fix everything else
Repeal means U.S. wouldn't have a strangle hold on Puerto Rico. 1 percent couldn't fleece them.
Senator McCain should know better than to spread BAD & wrong information. Governor's comments for accurate info.
Go back to sleep SongBird
Actually, it more complicated than that. There is infrastructure damage & they are not getting Drivers reporting to work to deliver supplies
Not like younHave delayed anything right song bird
This is so stupid that there’s no words. Sadly the administration is unfit for the job. Should be an easy temporary fix.
Why don't you donate some of your millions Senator??
Resign You pick and choose what you want to be concerned about...Help is coming.  Unlike help and relieve from Obamacare! 


More racism from 
This is just plain idiotic.
Sen Vote for statehood for PR that will be better. Your commentary is unlawful
You have read the Dem playbook and are in sync with their attacks on pres Trump. Just switch parties or retire.
Sen. McCain you're a hero. Be heroic again and help the people of PR. Force Trump to rescind #JonesAct for PR NOW!
Probably also has something to do with Trump trying to negotiate down the amount of taxes he owes PR
Those who are complicit w/delay are complicit w/murder. You've earned the right to thwart obstruction to save lives. Hell w/JonesAct. Rebel!
Well, if they didn't have so much Wall St. debt...
Hell w/JonesAct. Ignore it. Court later. Prez obstructing. Ppl dying. Plead w/states, nations, individuals, companies to act unilaterally.
If Puerto Rico was predominantly white we'd have already rebuilt the island.
Bonny Wright  @miamivandynyu
And half the population has no drinkable water. Meanwhile Trump tweets about the NFL.
To hell with the Jones act! Get the military deployed to distribute 3k containers to PR today. The deaths are at the feet of us ALL!
Get Real
Pls be specific as to why this is problem. Another senator said it was not a problem
Why the fck are you wasting your time with carrot top? Break loose while you still can.
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for bringing attention to this.
