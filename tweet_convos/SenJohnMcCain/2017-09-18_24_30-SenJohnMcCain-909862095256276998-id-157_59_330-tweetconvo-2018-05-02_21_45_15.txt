Please vote no on #GrahamCassidy if you truly care about a return to regular order.
Claiming we he can't repeal Obamacare because "restoring order" is BS. You leftists are pushing for ridiculous socialist healthcare
It's not BS. The bill has had no hearings, no CBO score and no Democratic involvement. It's a garbage process and Sen. McCain knows it.
The bill isn't garbage. That being said, there should be debate and it shouldn't be voted on until it is throughout amended and debated.
Yes, exactly! But the @GOP isn't doing that because they know their bill wouldn't stand up to the scrutiny. That's why I'm pissed.
No it's because they want to get it passed by the deadline for this year (9/30 I think). Still, there should be debate
Yes, the deadline is motivation but they know they can only pass this junk if people don't know the details. It is a truly awful bill.
Much better than Obamacare and a million times better than single payer nightmare
They deserve more. I'm glad you fought and won something. 
Now, how about letting us all stay alive? Please vote no on graham/Cassidy. Thx
Yes! Give our service men and women a raise. And then help to keep the rest of us alive and vote no on #GrahamCassidyBill
How can you justify voting to take healthcare away from millions of people? You of all people should know the importance of affordable care.
Got to get ready for that war in North Korea the GOP is pushing
That must not be allowed to happen. Trump must be removed from office as he isna clear and present danger to the world.
Who going to stop Trump No one in the GOP cares what he does
We will. We the people even if we have to take to streets, block every major highway around the nation. Total civil disobedience. A 
Block someone's right to freedom of movement (road/highway), and enjoy being ran over
I have two sons in the Military. Their moral is low because when they get out they will have to pay the Obamacare fine. Do what you promised
2.1% is not enough!! You people in Congress would laugh at that if it was yours. 2.1% = spit in the eye.
Maybe a bomb double loaded jet wet start would improve their morale?
.@SenJohnMcCain a 2% raise won't cover the increase in healthcare costs your #GrahamCasiddy bill would cause.
@SenJohnMcCain Graham-Cassidy bill will remove close to 2 million vets off of Medicaid. I don't think that was your intention. Couldn't be!
Please do not pass Cassidy/Graham Bill. It is the worst ideas rolled into one. Make a moral humane decision not a political one.
Senator. Vote no on Graham Cassidy. PROTECT OUR VETS
Great, Sen McCain...Now demand the the Republican healthcare bill go through regular order in the Senate and a CBO score before a vote.
The healthcare bill you support would strip care for thousands of veterans,however, reluctantly you embrace it.
Note: he still hasn't decided. The part about the vets is true, per @votevets
He needs to say not just "No," but "Hell, no,"
Great as long as you're excluded you Deserve NOTHING!
Please protect the health care of our troops and vote NO on Cassidy-Graham.
Also raises the Tricare costs for Retirees on fixed incomes
Obamacare provides a 100% increase in Americans health care costs ruining lives & businesses.
We need you to vote no on #GrahamCassidy  ,no CBO score until after Sept 30
NOT if you take health care away from 32 million Americans including veterans. VOTE NO! #TrumpNaziCare 
#TrumpDontCare 
#Resist
SENATOR IT'S THE CHURCH TODAY THE POPE TWEETED ME HE THEN ERASED TWEET! THE PREVIOUS POPE HAD MY MOTHER KILLED IN 2005 THEY COULDNT KILL ME!
Stop the never ending war, stop the repeated deployments..that will greatly improved thier quality of life
Maybe one vote Johnny to give the 9 million that he won't say where he got it from to the Troops that would be a nice gesture
No way
Retire
how come everyone with you in the Hanoi Hilton was almost starved to death but not you? just asking

Thank you for taking care of those who honorably served. Stay honorable & strong for America as well, vote NO on Graham-Cassidy. Please Sir.
Impeach trump and that would definitely improve morale.
Traitor traitor Traitor
2.1% is a joke.
Please do not support Cassidy graham bill devastating to pre existing conditions medical coverage caps so scared for our family and all
2.1% isn't shit compared to what you senators congress makes.
You can do better.  2.1% for troops while defense contractors get billions?  C'mon Senator!
They deserve a lot more than 2.1%
Increasing troop morale goes far beyond money. We are throwing money at pilots that are still fleeing the toxicity of our service.

Please vote NO on #GrahamCassidy!  It's the same lousy bill you heroically voted no on last time. Don't mess up your legacy!
Vote repeal ACA NOW!
Vote NO on #CassidyGraham

I agree with my friend @SenJohnMcCain: a sustainable solution to healthcare requires a bipartisan solution & regular order. 
Under gop healthcare midfle class cancer patients cannot afford treatments. The poor will just die from it.  Please stop this
NO to the ACA repeal!
Senator McCain, please don't let us down. Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy bill, please!
I went in, I got $37 every 2 weeks
I never had so much money in my life
As an E5 I think I was paid $8800 for a full year incountry Viet Nam
Not near enough....look at how much that shitbird in the Oval Office spends on golf and rallies. The priorities are wrong.
Why not give the military the money that you give to the illegals and ISIS congress is traitors to America vote them out as soon as possible
The troops and citizens should all have the same insurance as you and Congress. Everyone should get the cancer cure like you Mr Traitor
What about our quality of life Johnny boy?  When ur at the pearly white gates, will u look back and say u helped improve lives of millions?
But now I see the GOP is planning to try to push through another shameful Act
I was beginning to believe after your speech that you could get both parties to come up with a new Affordable Health Care Act
And what about the 30+ million you're about to throw off their health insurance plans?
Dear Senator please vote no on the Graham Cassidy healthcare bill. It is even worse than the one you couragiously voted no on. Please vote
no on Graham Cassidy. Test on respectfully 
Richard Punko, 1SG, UNITED STATES ARMY, (RET.) Thank you for your service and sacrifices.
That's not what we're interested in hearing about from you.
That 2.1% might get a sailor a cup of coffee somewhere, eh?
Vote NO. It will kill vets and kids. The CBO will NOT provide a full, complete score of Graham-Cassidy. NO ANALYSIS OF COVERAGE OR PREMIUMS.
Their quality of life will be adversely affected if #GrahamCassidy bill passes & eliminates provisions of ACA, incl $0 fed $ by 2026. VoteNo
More concerned with several million people losing healthcare right now. Feel you should help since WE pay for YOUR healthcare.
John, plz don't betray the American people say NO to this healthcare bill it's worst than the last time. Keep standing for us the people
Knowing you wouldn't face medical bankruptcy due to PED/PTSD would certainly improve troop morale. Vote NO on Graham-Cassidy @SenToddYoung
2.1%?  Yeah, that'll make a big difference. BS
...yet you will vote yes to rip healthcare away from those who need it most? Stop being a sheep & be the brave man we know you are. Vote NO!
Are you talking away our healthcare or not. Your pipeline contaminated my water My my quality of life declined. Kill me now or can I live?
NOT Communist News! It's truth! Trump doesn't know what Truth is, He warps the truth! I'm watching him at the UN Meeting! He's embarrassing
Retire Mcstain
2.1%? They can take their families to Taco Bell for dinner on that! How bout the $ for the Wall & Trump travel go to military raises, too.
What about when we are forced to leave under chapter 61. Don t we deserve quality of life? SA639 must be part of NDAA 2018
PLEASE Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
This is the man we need today, the one that promised regular order, that promised open hearings & working w/ Dem #VoteNOGrahamCassidy

This is great, please vote #NoToGrahamCassidy  #ProtectOurCare #FixACA .@SenJohnMcCain     .@lisamurkowski  .@SenatorCollins .@RoyBlunt
Im hoping that your eloquent words are still true We can not vote on an empty bill w/o open hearing CBO score & working both sides of aisle
I wouldn't hold my breath.Or bet any money on it.  @SenJohnMcCain is such a disappointment.Especially considering his situation. #SaveACA
Sir, morale - and life and health - of millions of Americans will be harmed by this health bill. Please give it the thumbs down
They should have the same medical coverage you have (dental etc.) as well...2.1% sounds somewhat low....
You all deserve it!
Thank you John McCain for Serving I the Vietnam  War for America !
That's great, but aren't our vets worth more than 2.1%?
Graham-Cassidy hurts mil families & we won't even know how deeply, because there will be no CBO score. MUST VOTE NO.
 BREAKING: CBO will NOT provide a full, complete score of Graham-Cassidy. NO ANALYSIS OF COVERAGE OR PREMIUMS  
2.1% pay raise? That's really not that much at all I mean our military needs at least a 5% pay raise Seriously? I hope I am misunderstanding
surefire way to improve morale: quit sending troops off to fight in propaganda & lies, and fulfill obligations to disabled vets afterwards.
Please keep in mind protecting both the military and all Americans healthcare. Vote no on this! Continue to be an American hero.  Thank You
Your continued back stabbing of America is what caused a quality drop.  http://www.cltampa.com/news-views/article/20751961/john-mccain-and-the-politics-of-sequestration â€¦ You voted for sequester! #MAGA #repealACA
What about veterans!

Say no John , this is a worse bill than the last , No cbo !!!
In my opinion, morale would be significantly raised if we got a new commander-in-chief.
Vote NO #GrahamCassidyBill
vote no on #GrahamCassidy
It's a start, but...I wonder how that compares to pay raises that Congress gives to themselves--I mean--our military actually HELPS America.
@SenJohnMcCain You know what would improve troop morale, having access to HC upon discharge. @SenToddYoung @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins
My husband is a veteran. We both applaud your urging the Senate to return to regular order.Please vote no on #GrahamCassidy
thank you for not voting something good down,AH
No Obamacare repeal!!
The ACA provides coverage for millions of Americans (vets) why are you destroying it VOTE NO @votevets
#GrahamCassidy cuts #Medicaid. 1,750,000 veterans covered by Medicaid. A vote for #GrahamCassidy is a vote to take healthcare from veterans.
That's good but you better think about the Graham/Cassidy\Heller healthcare bill that will hurt millions of Americans.
Liar.

Also, only a 2.1% pay raise, includes the dirtiest health care in America because of you.
If your supporting #FY18NDAA, IM AGAINST IT
Vote no on #GrahamCassidy
Dems have no choice but to play games with this if you threaten to kill Americans with Trumpcare.
We are depending on you to vote down this horrible HC Bill as you did before. All people deserve life.
Your friends on your aisle are trying to stick it to Americans again on healthcare.
vote no on #GrahamCassidy we need another one of these moments
I'll remember that for the rest of my life !!! Let's hope he feels the same
You must not have much of a life
Oh but veterans forum
Said ACA repeal will hurt them, maybe empathy for them!
Man, that is ripe coming from you!  Troop Morale??? 2.1 % after all these years and TBI patient still can't get the help they need!  #Resign
Support the ACA if you care about troop morale.
That is shameful anyone who votes against the out of control spying will be said to not care about the vets raises.this is why DC is broken.
This is great, now protect us by voting NO on #GrahamCassidy it will take away insurance for too many. What happened to your "procedure"?

Senator McCain, I am young and have many preexisting conditions. Please pledge to continue with bipartisan hearings. Worried sick
Ð˜Ð´Ð¸Ð¾Ñ‚......
I hope it is 2.1% on $55,000 as base pay for private
Vote no on graham/Cassidy. Please.
Good, they'll need the extra money to pay for healthcare if #GrahamCassidy passes.
Save healthcare for America
No regular order if there is no debate. You said you wanted regular order. Please say NO to your friend Graham. This is the worst bill yet!
Regular order on the health care bill please. Your words should be bond.
How about improving the quality of life of those with preexisting conditions? People who need essential health benefits?  #VoteNo
That's good, because if you vote for #GrahamCassidy a lot of veterans will be losing a lot of Medicaid support, so they'll need the money.
NAZIS cannot serve in the military.. so I ask you
#WHY would Black or Latino Americans fight & possibly die for white supremacist #REJECTS?
The people are counting on you john to vote against the healthcare bill .. it's totally against preexisting conditions .. I have cancer ..
