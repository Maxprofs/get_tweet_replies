You are a crazy too McCain
Your daily negative comments are not beneficial to the country. Trump is your leader and you need to be respectful.
how about you stand up to @realDonaldTrump and take him down?  #Impeach45
because he's too old and should be gone by now #TermLimits
These people are all nutbags Cristy. They just believe everything on TV.
funny how each one of us can't figure out how the other one thinks and why.
They're too busy calling us names to really care about anyone w/ an opposing view
Says the person generalizing everyone with an opposing view.
fire the leak
You have become a Traitor. It's time to retire! You and Graham are doing everything to destroy Trump and the US.

Big Man, Have You rode with the Rolling Thunder to D.C. ?

Democrats are a bunch of crazy people and they need mental health help
It's too bad you don't! To speak against our President as you did was TREASONOUS! Your no Gop.@POTUS
You've embarrassed your fellow naval aviators by not supporting your president.
Do you seriously think your comments are helpful?  The real dictator just left the White House in January!!  SO
WRONG!
Only wish we could say the same about you! Your poor decision making and disparaging POTUS has ruined your reputation!
@realDonaldTrump Let's not forget McCain, you crashed a plane. Did you skip classes at flight school?
He was humble and was a peacemaker. All the things I am not nor will I ever be. There goes a camera hey over here over here
you can honor him by standing up for our democracy and call out Trump.
perhaps you could show a bit of courtesy and civility yourself instead of undermining your president and country.
Please stop bashing U.S by
defacto sir.
Hate you McCain.   Can't decide what is worse you or the Democrats.
political hack
‚ÄîOne could wish that our present @POTUS embodied those same qualities, but alas...
He would never be a traitor like you are. So ashamed of you. Mentally ill-you need care. 
Please advise to the world,  what would you say if you were under duress - to those of whom are not your allies?
McCain MUST GO
I hear he was a "deal maker" just like you. And probably just as effective.
please put energy in getting the presidents cabinet  in place.  The Senate isn't doing its gob...
God bless President Trump, USA USA USA USA USA USA
will you please retire, you can go out with your head held high, seen enough of you thanks for your service and goodbye

Unlike you who continuously backstabs a sitting President. #timetoretire
something about McCain I never liked now I see why.He's  a  phony.
How about the soldiers in Vietnam that you got killed, when you sang like a canary to save your own ass? NO WAR HERO TRAITOR
Tell me you're not joining the Left's coup d'√©tat.
please continue to check the madman in the White House Senator.  Our great nation is in severe peril. #TheResistance
once a traitor always a traitor
Bob Michael hated you.
Quit / RETIRE / get out while some clueless peeps still actually like you. Take Lindsey Graham with you. Benedict Arnold's 
Trump needs to count McCain out, then find another guy in GOP for Lyndsey to hook up with or we'll lose 2 senators.
You are in disarray Johnny boy, you need to stop  attacking Trump.
'The POW Songbird.'- @SenJohnMcCain 
#JohnMcCain  #Vietnam
& Lindsay Graham R determined 2 undermine the Trump White House-demand term limits-they R part of what's wrong in DC!
what is fake mccain doing in Germany? Vets are dying everyday in his state at V.A. hospital.
fake mccain is in disarray with the V.A. hospital in his home state. He does nothing for the dying vets.
JM is a RINO
Senator - America needs you now - lead us out of this nightmare - country over Party.  I believe in you!

I care about America and Russia and this great planet I care about humanity I care about all life's in the galaxies and in
the solar system I care enough to say stop your war mongering against Russia a nuclear power we matter and they matter
You embody a bitter old man...Get over yourself.  Term Limits are the answer!  Be Bitter, Old, & Entitled somewhere else...
You should quit crying about Trump doing his job. Do yours for once. Try fixing the worst V.A. hospital in YOUR STATE
The worst V.A. hospital is in your state. Why doesn't the great war hero do something about it. Fake media - fake mccain
You are a fake! You never complained about Obama in the White House!
you are overseas complaining about our President and vets are dying in your state's worse V.A. hospital
you should be fired!
You are a embarrassment to the party, retire while you can
Honor him by putting COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY.  We need you.
Get behind the USA, get behind Trump now!
he was a much better man than you'll ever be!
For the sake of our nation please retire.

Your actions today were traitorous.

Being a Hero I'm wondering why you won't support a investigation. Russia important issue?

You are also a great man, great leader. Thanks for protecting US.

the pentagon thinks climate change is real, caused by us and a major national security concern. What do you think?
yo I bet this dude still uses flip phones
You're a coward, McCain.  Keep your mouth shut about tour Commander in Chief.
God Bless!!!
Congress consists of one-third, more or less, scoundrels; two-thirds, more or less, idiots; and three-thirds, more or less,
Your MSC speech to the world against President Trump shows you have neither "duty to Country" nor "honor." RESIGN IMMEDIATELY
We have people who have been in the congress for 50 years. We need term limits!
RIP. Did he know you were pardoned by Nixon
