please investigate cyberhacking as you said you would!
for all that is good, stop this DT train wreck.
Like Trump was mysteriously given "loans"from Deutsche Bank.On  which side of justice will you be standing??
as a #vet I'm asking 4 the love of God & country PLEASE #ImpeachHim ! Be the brace hero America needs! 
that was 1 of my most emotional tweets & I spell Brave wrong! See this Trump thing has made me stupid!
The emotion was there! You made way more sense than Trump, Spicer, or KellyAnne!!!
thank u! & that's coming from a TEACHER! 
Trump doesn't care. He probably wishes he could get rid of people he disagrees with...Traitor Trump.
@SamrichSamuel @washingtonpost fake news from WP
Sen McCain. History and the American people are watching. #Impeach @realDonaldTrump
And yet you still endorsed Trump, @SenJohnMcCain, even after knowing of his Russian ties.
A president in America is seriously corrupt and #GOP #Congress needs to speak up.
Didn't one of the sources for the Russian Dossier just die mysteriously? Interesting.
Yes!  WE need to hear from the POTUS!  But, he is busy tweeting about Nordstoms!
HEY MCCAIN WHAT IS UR DRUG OF CHOICE, CRACK
But it's ok for DJT to say compare the US with Putin/Russia? Republican leaders need to speak up #noexcuses
why aren't you speaking up for America?  Please investigate Trump's ties to putin.
Wonder who murdered the creator of RT in DC Hotel? How about young DNC guy shot in DC?  Other US murders
to bad not you
that will never happen when DJT is in bed with Putin. How can you stomach that fact?
Putin owns Trump via Deutsche Bank. We need heroes in DC to represent citizens. Sir, I pick YOU. Please.
we do need to speak up!!! Grow some balls McCain and speak up for the American people
That's a pretty weird statement to use on someone who landed on flight decks and was POW
well according to Donny & I quote "he is not a war hero because he was captured".  I like McCain. But he need 2 stand up to Donny
I don't think your automatically a hero for being captured.  When you act with courage as a prisoner, you are heroic.
Thank you for posting this, Sen. McCain. But please please please investigate the Trump-Putin bromance.
I DONT READ WAPO = FAKE NEWS
Quisling
You want War with Russia or do you want their help defeating ISIS?  OOP you know ISIS Intimately don't you
@DavidDark @washingtonpost did he read a letter from Coretta Scott King? Can't have that.
#ForShame #BetsyDeVos = unqualified. Payback for all the $ she's given #GOP. U put party before country again
@PatHeibBrock @washingtonpost #CrookedTrump can't say anything bec it might affect his bromance w/Pootin. #PutinPuppet #p2
Senator McCain: you and your colleagues need to DO MORE. This is our country, Democrat or Republican!
put your money where your mouth is and #rejectSessions
Wonder how that happened. Maybe Trump's buddy was involved?  They both like repression of the press.
@realDonaldTrump won't speak up for Ukraine... will you call him to speak up for this?  or #alternativefacts
have you? What is your opinion regarding trumps response to putin is a killer remark?
Yep what's new John it seems that would be their problems. What happens in Russia is not our business.
we are yelling loud and clear: #DumpDevos Country before party, always!
- please BE the CHANGE.  #WeThePeopleoftheUSA are looking for leaders that use their powers for good.
Oh what the heck, Trump kewl with Putin. U voted for him so enjoy.can't have your cake and eat it too, McCain
lies again John.Ex Ukr president Yushchenko was "poisoned",elected,then it was found that poisoning was a lie
You are fully aware of what is going on, as is anyone with IQ of 90+. he must b stopped! US being destroyed!!
GOP must do more than read. Time to act
Had enough yet, Senator? We're looking for heroes, you got any heroism left? A real hero would stand up to Trump. Forcefully.
psssh
Thank you Senator for fighting injustice. It's important for more Republicans to be bold like you've been!
Love what you're doing to corral a renegade executive. Keep up the good work, our country's survival depends on it. Thank you
POTUS loves Putin!
How about worry about the probs we are in all over the place? NO MORE WAR !!!!! @SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost
better reading is how you helped arm, train and deploy terrorists and how the Post helped cover it up.
Biggest shock of late, finding out how few Republicans are American!
@CAO916 @washingtonpost This is what happens when you remain silent & support someone like #Trump.
speak up senator mccain. we believe in you.
Trump is the Manchurian Candidate
you are sick man. This  "activist" taking mental meds  for years
it would be great if you would stand up for American's labor rights and vote against Andrew puzder.
https://twitter.com/moekamerow/status/826969027381596161 â€¦
How much longer before elected officials know what Americans already know. trump is compromised.
I implore you to do something fast! Speak up before we start a war!!
@realDonaldTrump we're waiting for a response from Washington. What will it be?
You started this when you agreed to run with Sarah Palin. Waco Palin, Demagogue Donald... who's next? Fix it
You're a Patriot from a family of Patriotic leaders. US needs strong Congressional leadership URGENTLY!
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost Agreed!  But I think Trump needs to get a grip...why is your republican president so supportive of Putin?
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost  Trump asks for DNC to be hacked, bashes CIA, is negative on NATO, and goes out of way to support Putin
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost Perhaps the "dossier" has more truth than not.  It does not take political genuis to see something is wrong.
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost It is up to the Republicans to fix this and deal with the Kremlin Puppet.
#impeachtrump first then people and media can speak up without fear of our own president's abuse of executive power.
We need you to lead the resistance. I am so afraid for our country right now! #resist
Someone please expose TRUMPs REAL tie with Putin so we can remove him as president
thank you for the integrity to speak up. Republicans need to think & act independently now more than ever
This is dishonarable & despicable behavior.  Also how do you feel about "1st Woman" Trumps disgraceful nudes.
Senate Republicans fight back !  Don't just roll over!
you're more important than ever! GOP has lost integrity/respect over Trump. Show them the way!  Partisanship killing USA!
maybe it's my paranoia speaking something just isn't right here
.@SenJohnMcCain @ElleDeeTweets @washingtonpost While I disagree w/ @GOP you at times are voice of reason. We need you in fight w/ #45
Is America far behind? A Republican Party official in northern Michigan wants another Kent State.  Stopthis!

can u McCain speak up against DEVOS??? Do you really expect others to do so if u just turn blind eye on kids?
Please continue raising awareness and concern of our new president making a bedfellow of a dangerous leader
Please stand up against Trump!
Speak up against you promoting your own personal agenda. Support Trump and MAGA. You're the problem with GOP
so when does the Senate begin investigation into @realDonaldTrump camp 4collusion w/Russians? #TheResistance
Senator, you know this and it continues to show up again & again. What will you do? DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION!
our potus says that the U.S. has plenty of killers. Pls comment on this on Sunday.
take a stand and save our democracy.  This is a political coup. Country over party sir, always.
please stop him.  For the love of country and generations to come.
I am a democrat but grateful there are  sane Republicans. This has to stop before it's to late.
Please investigate! We're counting on you.
@owenbernard @washingtonpost Where is that Russia collusion invest coming? Still loyal to Bannon/Russia over nation?
@owenbernard @washingtonpost speak out against trump love of putin!
Russia! Russia! Russia!
and why does @POTUS @realDonaldTrump continue to PRAISE PUTIN when we know he is behind these many deaths ?
@shyduroff @washingtonpost    And you must vote against DeVos
But Trump just said Americans aren't really any better than a killer like Putin. #TrumpOnOReilly
NOT OUR BUSINESS...AMERICA FIRST WE HAVE OUR OWN PROBLEMS TO SOLVE!  YOU ARE A BUSYBODY SENATOR
. So obsessed with war with Russia that you overlook all the hacks and China military build up. #SorosPuppet
@funder
What about the Navy SEAL that was killed SENATOR McCain?!?!?
Going to start a hearing in to that?!
Trump not even on the job 2 weeks and he killed 1 and injured 3. smh
Please Impeach him before we are all in prison for speaking out. What is wrong with @SpeakerRyan ?
@POTUS : 'Putin murders rivals/journalists? You think our country is so innocent?' Terrible universe Putin/Trump offer
Thank you Senator McCain.
Senator stop tweeting and get him out of there. He's a traitor. You know it. For Gods sake do your job!
Thanks for speaking out against trump.  We are counting on you and your persuasion of other senators!
... tks - pls let public know what US is doing to help our young journalist friend. is he still in Russia?
so please speak up! I'm with you Sen. McCain!
- keep on the Russia connection.
stop trying to start wars.
Don't worry John, Sarah is keeping look out. @SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost
Excellent!! Keep standing up, Senator McCain!
How can you support Trump? This is not the country you suffered for. Our country's values should come before political party.
yeah so you gonna speak up Maverick?
Delete your account.
are you really surprised with Tillerson running state department? Why did you vote for him?
@CHSommers @washingtonpost where were you as the bodies were falling by the wayside in the Clinton wake
@karolcummins @washingtonpost talk to your boy in the Whitehouse. The reporter probably had the goods on trump
@ActDontReact @washingtonpost We worked to save this guy once before what's the problem?
@CHSommers @washingtonpost you old bribe taking turkey.
you have the mic... use it!
@CHSommers @washingtonpost Hey McCain! Y don't u speak up 4 the1000's of raped/dead ppl, killed by refugees u helped create!?
You still have yet to call and apologize to @netanyahu and the Cuban refugees for Obama's actions.
You're a Senator, your role in foreign affair is, oh wait, you don't have one.
Sounds like maybe you ddn't get your check from him John.  John McCain; selling out his country since 1967
McCain has been  in a War mode against Putin after  Trump won the presidency.  For What?
One more warmonger blames Putin for everything. Clean up your on ass before blaming someone.
TY @SenJohnMcCain, but what else can/will you do to save our democracy from @realDonaldTrump ?
Or Speak Out Like This ?? You Wonder Why Obama Hillary Wanted To Gag Social Media..   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsZg_maF0ow â€¦
Or Like This ?? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8JppJyVxYU â€¦
Speak Up Like This??  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVprm69pzrA â€¦
Hate to say it, but I wouldn't put POTUS beyond this kind of repression. Why does he support Russia?
Putin has the same troubles as America the only difference of their gov is conventions.
Don't read that piece of shit paper.  McCain the Media whore can't stand POTUS is in media more than him.
- you are so out of control spewing BS this is exactly how you will be remembered. Get over it
Putin likes to poison his enemies. Better watch what YOU eat, Vladimir.
Hey Senator if you want to stop Putin you need to stop Trump. Clearly. But you seem to value GOP party more.
Not the first time they've used poison to assassinate.
we know that. We have someone mentally ill in the WH. Do something abt that! U can't. Scared of a Trump tweet
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost You are a warmonger, and you are attempting to create a narrative to further your own agenda.  Won't work.
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost Ludicrous!  Russia didn't interfere when Justice Scalia was pronounced dead, and no autopsy.
America First!? Not with McCain, who prefers war to peace.
.@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost So it is your contention that #USA  needs to interfere in the health of a citizen in another country?
Respect ur war service, but unary now COMPROMISED...Under Soros. Hang em up old man
Cut the crap...u didn't say SHIT when Hillary Clinton opponents committed suicide. Now u worry about Russia?
You have enabled Trump. This is what you get.
He doesn't get off that easy.  He needs to fix this mess.  Investigations in progress
How about all the people who died along the Clinton political journey? Did you speak up?"
why are you not joining the sane reps? Your history is being written! #resist
Yes! We need to remove Putin from the White House.
yet your buddy @realDonaldTrump thinks Putin's a nice guy. End this madness now, please.
@realRogueLeader @washingtonpost We have been speaking up about Russia sir. Where is the outrage from the GOP sir?
hey Senator, why don't you and your elite club lackies quit trying to pick a war with Russia? We see thru BS
I don't respect him caus he's like uncle Alzheimer. Doesn't no if he's Arthur or Martha
weird? policy on Cuba will be reviewed but need to be the best friends with Putin.
I tweeted 2 prez about this, doubt I'll see any results considering his admiration for Putin
#McCainHadHimPoisoned
everyone gets sick I guess. Without clearly establishing the link with kremlin, why pointing fingers?
Then go the president Senator, and speak up. Can't you help? He does have a lot on his plate....
stop war mongering against Russia mr McCain no intelligent person wants a war against a nuclear super power
a nuclear war against any nation effects this beautiful planet,humanity,all life in the solar system,others
lives in the galaxies and effects timelines.
I speak up for other lives in the galaxies when I say John McCain stop your war mongering
Please press Trump and Dept. of State to get him back here for treatment! Trump/Putin romance stops NOW!
so McCain, are we going to rescue him again, or let Putin kill him? Your call!  Time is of the essence!
Yes, this is the second time he has become mysteriously ill.  This is extremely worrying.
@CynNarwahl @washingtonpost Putin's USA Coup d'etat won't stop by activists. Manchurian puppet President Trump doing fine job
I'm a Tx Democrat.  I appreciate you!
Read Time's article on Bannon's obsession with "The 4th Turn" and you'll understand. Dangerous dooms-dayer
i have enormous respect for you, but you need to be more forthcoming with your opposition to president trump.
I'm a democrat citizen. Nonetheless, I do admire your sense of high ethics as R senator. TY 4 what u r doing!
Dear Mr McCain. Please remove this fascist president.
I salute veterans, war heroes, including POW's. You serve our country proudly, then and now. Do the rt thing.
2/needed is "stunning courage" by Congressional mbrs to stand up, speak up against the rouge Administration!

#PaulRyanIn4Words 
so appreciate your bipartisn voice at this time.  I am a dem, my fam are rep who did not vote 4 Trump - we r counting on you
There is no mystery here. Putin kills his enemies.
@PuestoLoco @washingtonpost Then press for thorough investgation into trump/friends ties w/Russia! Don't allow suppression!
hypocrite much
Stop voting for his nominees.
Well @SenJohnMcCain you voted for Tillerson, oil co's to hide foreign payments & to allow US banks to fund FSB/KGB spying. Duplicitous much?
This backing of Tillerson boggles me. John could have so easily opposed him. Phony.
@sheenA_8886 @washingtonpost Need a result from investigation on hacking and Trumps involvement with Putin.
Thank you, Senator!
This is treason people,  Trump has committed treason anyone else would be arrested
#resist #standingunited #TrumpRussia #generalstrike #NationalStrike #NOWARWITHIRAN #Traitor Trump
We know all about this.  What can be done?
@Unite2020 @washingtonpost thank you John.
so obvious....
thank you for paying attention. Az resident 85260.
Senator, you & @GOP need to salvage what's left of our democracy before its 2 L8
Why don't you talk about the Oak Flat deal that you screwed the Apaches over? How much did Res Copper pay you
