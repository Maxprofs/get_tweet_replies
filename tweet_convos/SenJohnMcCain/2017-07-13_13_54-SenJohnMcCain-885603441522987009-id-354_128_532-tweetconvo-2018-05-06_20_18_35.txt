You are the obstruction and leaker Hanoi John
That's nice..Your career is almost over. How about actually helping the poor and middle class.Something different.History won't be kind.
Republicans need to stop the protecting this despotic president destroying the America. After the last decade of obstruction of GOP . .
that puts party, agenda, inaction and the disregard of the future I am a never GOP. I expected much more from you.
If McCain likes him that is a huge RED FLAG. Is he neocon warmonger like you @SenJohnMcCain?
Mc
Wasn't just Merrick Garland. It was 82 Obama nominees blocked by GOP. 82! Some just routine appointments. Worst behavior in history.
#resist
I agree, we should handle this just like y'all did with Garland. And right after the Trump Administration is booted out for treason
Dems are minority. We literally cannot obstruct! Stop playing blame game. Be an adult.
I don't see how we can move forward, the American people are very concerned that the President is under investigation.  And Merrick Garland.
You are a hypocrite.  You are part of the obstruction.
Dear KNUCKLEHEADS IN CONGRESS,
NO MORE TASK FORCE SMITHS! Enough of this political BS!
It's clear that @SenJohnMcCain had a spine at 1 time and credibility...But, heck, that was a looonnng time ago.  #SellOut #GetOut #PinkSlip
Fix health care then, instead of denying it.
Repubes are getting what they showed Dems to do by Obama years of obstruction at the hands of McConnell. Turnabout fair play.
How about we not approve any nominations from a president that may not be legitimate?
So my vote & millions of others shouldn't count? He won, Tony. His message was better for working class Americans.
His message was not better for working class Americans. What was his message? The entire campaign was a wish list not a plan.
After an 8yr attack on mnfg and working Americans surely you understand what the appeal to Trump is, right?
What 8 year attack? You mean the job growth under Obama? The millions of jobs added in 8 years?
You don't think it's good to require NATO members to meet their $ commitment?
This tweet shows you don't know what you're talking about. Stop listening to trump. He is a proven liar.
This shouldn't be a problem since you're so sure.
You arent tapping dancing in joy as Schumers butt buddy, this way you stay on obamas good side if that even exist, unless youre muslim
How about you not support the nominations from and admin so obviously in league with one of our enemies, mr war hero?
Explain to POTUS that Dems aren't obstructing anything. Reps have the majority & still can't get these ppl confirmed.
God Bless you sir. You should be POTUS
Did you feel the same way when republicans were obstructing Obama for 8 years?
... Tell that to M. Garland... hypocrite.
We the people must shut this down call in and let your voice be heard. Stand up be American Proud
VA Hospital isn't good enough for you JOHNNY BOY??????  Hmmmmm notice you didn't have to wait MONTHS for TREATMENT!!!!!
OBSTRUCTION.what a joke..you gutless Reps feed into DEMS RUSSIA BS & WASTE TAX dollars instead of doing your JOBS and SUPPORTING OUR PREZ!!!
Merrick Garland, Merrick Garland, Merrick Garland!!!
Way to stand up to the Trump/Russia administration.

com·pla·cent
Retire already
Wow, you've said something intelligent for once, RINO
You guys are awfully busy lately trying to make the treason peg fit in the patriotism hole. It doesn't fit.
Maybe it's time to act with honor and stop allowing this Whitehouse to lie cheat and steal our way out of democracy John. Standup already
Hey mccain. U are the biggest obstructionists in dc! Ever heard of glenn simpson and fusion gps? U should be strung up and horsewhipped!
How can you keep supporting Trump? He's a traitor and a danger to this country! IMPEACH!
If obstruction has 2 stop, then start by getting #kushner security clearance revoked! #Sessions needs to step down also! Whats wrong w/GOP
This rino also gets funding from George soros
This rino is involved with fake Russian news against trump
McCain has got to STOP taking and start working on supporting our President or else get out of the business once and for all.
Get it stopped!!!
obstruction this as this appointment will equal #obstructionofjustice
First order of business: remove Kushner, Ivanka and impeach Trump. The obstruction and crime has to stop. I can't believe this is America.
I really use to admire u Mr. McCain. I still do appreciate all ur sacrifices for the US. Please just go ahead & join the Dems.
Remember Merrick Garland? That was obstruction. Trump is under criminal investigation for treason. Good reason to thoroughly vet everyone.
Impeach the traitor, then we can start talking about filling nomination in the Pence administration.
When are you going to support S.66 and let disabled veterans and chapter61 retiree's collect their retirement?
What obstruction, GOP has control of what and when everthing is done
"Obstruction has to stop." The irony.
Maybe it's time for repubs ti stop understanding trumps appointees until we have an answer on collusion
That's rubberstamping
Talk is cheap what are you all going to do about it you can't even get the health care plan done fighting amongst yourselves so much
Giddy up Mustang.  Trump hugger
You're misleading the American people-did you forget the "Gang of 6"? Rs & Ds working in the AHA, but then betrayal:
Oh Senator. You were once our great hero. What's happened to you?
If your dad likes Shanahan then maybe TRUMP should change his pick. Your dad is a closet anti-TRUMP Democract in Rep clothing.
GOP is in control.   do your job.  make it happen.
There should be no votes on anything until we know if @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is a Russian agent.
???WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
IS ANYBODY LISTENING ?
HOW CAN THEY LISTEN IF THEYr NOT THERE???.
LET'S HAVE EVERYONE ATTEND EVERYONEofTHESE SPEECHES
Like you obstruction of Obama's SC nomination senator hypocrite.
You should be more worried about WH obstruction. What happened to your backbone?
NOT POLITICS!!!!
CORRUPTION!!!!!!!!!!!
REGULAR ORDER
WHERE IS IT?
IS THERE NO SANITY 
JUST KEEP FIGHTING AND WE WILL HAVE NOTHING
MORE OF EVERYTHING!!!!!
Stop the obstruction!
Don't be a #hypocrite. You refused Obama's SC nominee for a year.
We are talking about allowing the SecDef to do his job serving and protecting the men and women of our armed forces. Get over it and vote!
Wow you finally said something intelligent...
Tell #Trump to bring more middle of the road nominations
Obstruction by whom? The Democrats - whose votes you shouldn't need for a qualified, non-criminal, non-Russia-loving candidate?
Merrick Garland, you two-faced lying grifter. Take some of your bribe money and go buy some integrity.
Pot meet kettle.
Dems have their agenda.  Obstruct, focus on Russia, & get liberals to harass GOP leadership on social media.  Deploy the 'nuclear option.'
Funny, that's what America said when a Supreme Court seat sat vacant for 422 days.......hypocrite.
You're not stupid enough to believe what Trump says is truthful so what your doing is obstructive. Hypocritical to call Dems obstructive.
aside from Garland and the GOP obstruction for 6 years- the AMERICAN people have trust issues with the WH, #swamp45 #potus Flake and the GOP
Then stop @SenJohnMcCain because ur part of it
Correct!!!
do something mccain
you have a very good salary that is why you don't care for VETERANS struggling for benefits at Dept of labor
McCain that is what you have to do at dept labor FECA dept stop the obstruction dishonesty in handling claims
Hey McCain 
So your using the word obstruction now. You Republicans control both houses.
Maybe you should come out LOUD and STRONGLY in opposition to new healthcare proposal NOW.  That might speed things up.
Agree, however, where were you on Merrick Garland?  The ultimate obstruction.
You need to work with the GOP and Donald Trump. Stop fighting with the administration and work to make America great again
John, isn't it amazing how obstruction under one party is do diligence under the other. What goes around also comes around. # forget
can I believe my ears did McCain wake up an figure out he's an American

THIS is what you're spending your time on? Focus!
tell it to Garland
Says the pot to the kettle 
The problem is that if the left rarely put America before there self interests. They hate Trump and hate rarely shows much reason.
We all know you don't have the brain to write what you read on the floor.  We all know you're a in the closet democrat
No, it doesn't. How's it feel?
McCain is the swamp Get his ass out of Washington DC
Your the disinformation agent we are at war against traders like you our war will be won when we vote u out
That's right @SenJohnMcCain. Repub obstruction with regard to Russian election interference must stop. Repubs must stop protecting Trump.
Garland!!
You guys obstructed for 8 years.
Senator McCain. You stood by while GOP Senate obstructed Obama for 6 yrs, including 11 months for SCOTUS nominee. Stop with your hypocrisy.
The obstruction has to... who are you?
Then get moving on Russia.  Jared K.  should not have a security clearance.  Sessions should be fired for his lies.  Move
#retire
Then impeach that idiot occupant in the WH
No, the bullshit has to stop first.  Senator, you used to have a little sway with your party,  but now you're just another old guy. Impeach.
Sorry that we are a little concerned about how things are going so far.
Well, for the past eight years, you have allowed obstructionist to work in the government Drain the Swamp.
Time to retire you old treasonous Democrat
Explain that to @SenMajLdr #MerrickGarland.
Hannity just played a clip  of you and obviously he made you look like the fool that you are
Lies!!
Illegal election requires a new election so no new appointees.
Full repeal of obozoCare Stupid bankrupt medical
Interesting how your pro-McCain teeets are from Dems who would never vote for you or any R.
You do not get it. This is not a legitimate government. You are on the wrong side of history Senator. Happy I did not vote for you.
John, your keen judgement is so intermittent. Obstruction should have stopped with Merrick Garland. It should continue now.
Rethinking the decision to have a secret meeting to block 44's presidency and undermine democracy...
Too bad you're part of the Dem obstruction.
You weren't saying that for the last 8 years,Maverick.
Go nuclear !!!!!!
Well said!  Impressive.  Yes it must stop, this is insanity itself, holding up our country.
Ayeeeeeee remember how you and yours obstructed the last President at literally every step for the last eight years champ?
Cut the BS dude. Garland derserved a vote and now you're trying to act like Dems are obstructing. Maybe there's a good reason to be careful
Mccain begging fir russian dollars
too bad y'all didn't feel this way about obstructing a year ago. y'all are the biggest obstructionists ever. now you cry obstruction?
The only obstruction going on is you & your friend Graham, who spew abt Trump & sit & do nothing about him-u know he's corrupt-do something!
we want Kelli Ward, not this traitor. we know your dad commited voter fraud & stole the election! she had a huge lead. another Soros puppet
#MerrickGarland
Well, maybe John will take some of his own advice.
John.  We dealt with rabid, unparalleled obstruction for eight years.  Please.  I don't think this qualifies.
Finally should've been doing this all along. Can't stand these egos any longer.
How about your obstruction Mr. Senator?! You haven't done anything but stonewall this @POTUS's agenda. You're to blame. Term limits please!
Everything that comes out of John McCain mouth is FAKE !!!
Merrick Garland. #SCOTUSstolenseat
What in God's name is taking so long for the presidents nominees to get thru SHAME ON U & THE REST OF THE REPUBLICANS U NEED TO GET IT DONE
Its about time u r doing something other then speaking out against the president for now u r still a Republican how about doing to HELP
You mean all that obstruction like you and the others did because of that BLACK MAN in the White House? Yet NOW you want to do your jobs?
the obstruction created by you and your cronies against the American people HAS TO STOP. Trump building new jail to hold all you crooks
Bring the GOP to the center. Country before party. Stop the madness!
Well get your buddy McConnell to get rid of "tradition" and courtesy nonsense and call for votes.
Wow! You want the obstruction to stop.... you helped it with that fake dossier
MERRICK GARLAND
GOP stops WH obstruction & you'll see noms pushed through pretty quick, I'd say
So your finally standing up for something? Your a leech on the public dole
Mr. McCain were dismissive during the Sessions nomination hearings and now worried about obstruction.  Step up like we know you can.
Here here
I thought you were the obstacle John...
Like you obstructed President Obama? Hypocrite.
Isn't it time for you to retire!!! RINO!
Aren't you obstructing daily? Failure is all yours, while America suffers
Remember when 44 couldn't get a hearing on a SCOTUS nominee? Please represent us and demand the president get a mental health evaluation
New Healthcare plan still sucks! Vote NO!
Thanks for doing your job
I'm a fan of yours Senator, but any mention by the GOP of obstruction is beyond pathetic. The party never gets to use that word again.
This guy is more important then the obstruction on the supreme court nomination??? Get over it John
John McCain 
Stop playing both sides of the table.
Stand with the people, do some good.some still trust you .
Most don't
Hope you take your own advice.
What about the GOP obstruction of Kushner having his clearance revoked. You should be ashamed of yourself. How much money did you take?
Sir, there can be no obstruction from the Dems!!! Seriously, how hard is this for your side to figure out? Did you all flunk basic math?
You want to push thru noms of a POTUS who is compromised by a foreign enemy and thinks collusion is ok. Do you think colluding w/ Russia ok?
Don't call it obstruction! If he is not fit for the job, I expect opposition. Country b4 party
If having a year left in his term was good reason to obstruct Obama, being under investigation for impeachable offenses is surely enough now
The new FBI director needs to investigate your ties with George Soros! YOU are corrupt and the definition of a  poitics hack.
Funny you are, spewing silly Republican talking points. Move along, America; no maverick here!
Sounds familiar oh yes when McConnell said his only job was to deny president Obama everything his administration tried to do. Sucks huh?
Merrick. Garland.
Well his meds are working first god thing he has said in a while
Glad to see you finally woke up. Where were you months ago on Dem obstruction? I think you secretly loved it.
Ok, McCain you know the obstruction won't stop so what are you going to do about it. You're part of the problem -- shut up and do something
Congress is a disgrace in their Liberal Obstruction. Vengeful losers. Not the party of JFK. Glad their not in the White House.
Two words: Merrick Garland. You've no right to complain. Also the legitimacy of this presidency is in question. No business as usual.
I was in the gallery & witnessed his confirmation vote this AM. You posted this 3 hrs AFTER he was confirmed.Why? Thats purposely misleading
Maybe you should read this Meghan-
Stop obstructing the health of the PEOPLE, stop obstructing the security of our elections, stop obstructing our democracy DO SOMETHING!
You are more of a democrat than Republican, tell them to stop the obstruction.
