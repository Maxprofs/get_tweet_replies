Please listen. Stories of children who are alive today because #ACA allowed them a chance to fight like John McCain.
LIVESTREAM ➝ I'm joining fellow @SenateDems & Americans who are speaking out against unacceptable health care plan. https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1443949325690945 …

we can fight like McCain if we have health insurance like McCain.
Impeach lying conman phony crook @POTUS if you have an ounce of dignity @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenDeanHeller @DRUDGE_REPORT @MSNBC
You are a true patriot and hero. Please remove Putin regime from the White House. Get well soon
So happy to see you back in the Senate Senator McCain. Keep fighting like you always do.
God bless you, Senator McCain. Sending love and healing prayers. 
Sen.John McCain, u are a hero to me. I am not a Republican but I appreciate speaking truth to power. U show ur bravery.
Who run from danger, and is protected by Democrats, Commy traitor
ya mean mean sneaky and deceitful?????
Right up until you cave
Remember, @realDonaldTrump called it #DisgraceTheNation now's the time to show #Trump what a real #maverick is made of! #VoteNo
Blessings to you, sir. Thank you for for all the days of your service to our Country. I look forward to your return to the Senate.
Get well soon John MCain. Your name of all names is the name I remember in the senate who does not necessarily vote for his party.
Enough is enough.
Tell that to the pilots that died when you gave up their flight plans to the enemy, songbird McCain
John your a Fighter, let God guide your path
you are a monster
It’s a better fight when you have resources, the tools needed. Like #healthcare to combat illness.
This was a thoughtful, beautiful tribute to your integrity.  Not sure anyone could have said it better!
any weapons we give FSA wind up in Al Nusra/Al Queda's hands.  Assad is no angel.  Neiher is Saudi leaders. better than Al Queda/Al Nusra.
A REAL hero. Hopefully DJT saw this. Not that it will matter, but deep down he'll know what true patriotism looks like.
I think we missed a chance to have a great president in 2000. He'd have been fine w me in 2008 as well.
As horrible as the treatments will be...nothing like what he has already survived and conquered with courage and dignity.We're with you.
Amen to that sentiment!
But please fight for the right things - unlike @SenJohnMcCain

How will you explain to someone in Phoenix that they will play 4x, 50% more, or 2x what hey pay under ACA @JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain? 
I have a question, Since you are a Vet Hero. Why didnt you use the VA hospital?
To bad he fights against the people!
#FightLikeMcCain: Drop Agent Orange on Vietnamese farmers & be considered a hero
Johnny has been a bad boy forever.
You are a real HERO--someone I've always admired!  Thank you for all that you've done and continue to do! Praying for your recovery!
Not sure if this a good time to say this but @SenJohnMcCain now you should know the real value of having good healthcare, help others like u
Best wishes, Senator. Now please stop your party from taking away our health insurance.
Lovely words for a very lovely man. Thinking of you. 
Sending you my prayers for His healing touch
Retire

How ironic that over the last few election cycles McCain has had his Conservative purity questioned. Now fighting cancer he is a Saint?




Yes, I really liked it. Decency has no political party.

Godspeed @SenJohnMcCain
Have you looked at clinical trials?  Try here: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Glioblastoma&term=&cntry1=&state1=&recrs=a …
God bless you Senator!
True! @SenJohnMcCain has lead and fought by example his whole life & he still is ! Fight on Senator!
You've been wishing death to other people that death decided to come for you.

I worked w/ Pres Obama to roll back part of Obamacare that was harming vets & now I hope Dems will to the same. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3oKgKEAIDw&feature=youtu.be …

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 
Hi

When GOP rejects false choice of repeal only or #Trumpcare on steroids, we are ready to work on bipartisan solutions that help all Americans
Hope you're not ok with hurting our most vulnerable communities? #NoCutsToMedicaid #SaveOurCare #BCRAp #SinglePayer
These graphs make pretty clear that BCRA does NOT provide access to health care for those with low incomes: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/07/20/how-bcra-2-0-would-impact-enrollee-costs-according-to-your-age-and-income/ …

*Tell your reps to #FixACA…
Wishing you the best for a complete recovery, Senator!  Thanks for continuing to be an inspiration to us all!
Thank You, Honorable Mr. McCain, for always supporting my freedom and my way of life.

Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do. 
You mean all talk and no action?
Please do something for Syria...
Even the Left knows what a fighter you are!  Never give up!!
You can't keep Satan down
