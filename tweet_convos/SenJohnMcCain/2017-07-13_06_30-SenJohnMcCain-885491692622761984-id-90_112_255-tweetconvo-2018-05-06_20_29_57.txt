#TrumpRussia
OBAMA DOJ LET THE RUSSIAN IN
 MYSTERY SURROUNDS VESELNITSKAYA 
 MCCAIN WANTED DIRT ON TRUMP FROM FOREIGN SPY
trump asked putin about this, twice. said he wasnt involved.  time to move on, John.
What makes you trust Putin so much....?
Is it senescence or does one become a more accomplished lunatic as the years roll on? I ask out of concern, you don't seem well old man
Montenegro fought him off, but he got the USA so there's that. Smdh.
Wait America government under obama overthrow a few countries government! Your a disgrace
Yawn

Forget about other countries and wonder about ours and this traitor president.. smh..
then why do you try to undermine the President at every turn?
but we just elected a Russian president! Shouldn't we get the Russians out of our country first?
So what do we call it when we are busy doing the same in the MIDDLE EAST? 
John McCain: This man is a traitor. His fellow prisoners provided statements that have been sealed that he was a traitor. Unseal now
Hold Trump accountable!  Wake up @senategop you are going to go down with him
Hey songbird ...time for u to retire...
We used to be pretty good at that. Remember radio free Europe. Then we started electing the kumbaya crowd.
... stop trying to divert, stand up to the Fascist or retire & take your corrupt, unpatriotic cronies with you ... corrupt since Keating 5.
Any plans to take Kushner's security clearance or will you be letting the treason continue?
Wait, what? THIS is your problem with Russia? They colluded WITH THE GOP CANDIDATE 4PRESIDENT?!THAT seems like something u should focus on.
You want our country to go to war and to screw Russia because an old vendetta...they did not give you money for your failed campaign
need push to update our power grid. We're so vulnerable and R knows this. Potus has put R in our pocket. What in th world??
Are you still taking money from George Soros ?@seanhannity
Interesting hearing. Thanks for sharing the link.
Please could you talk to my senator @JohnCornyn about this? I am not sure he understands the big picture & it truly scares me
Putin's plan to undermine democracy was the theft of our presidential election&installing his PUPPET in the White House. All w @GOP support
Will Soros let you talk about Democrats colluding with Russians?

...Don't you think you have a CASE STUDY A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME that you should be looking into some more????
John, I love Montenegro, my best friends are from Montenegro, I got married in Montenegro, I placed in an F1 race in Montenegro, but...
What's with all these lame posts about #Russia and other countries? How about being outraged about the interference at home?
So please bust those who conspired with Putin to mess with our election, even if you must oppose Trump and your party's enablers of him!
And Republicans are just screwing around while he does it to the US.
From one Vet to another.... YOU weren't a POW for this crap. Your better than this!
Time to move on
Anything a man in your position of power can do to convince the executive branch that Russia is not our friend? If so, do it.
Your attempt to recreate the Cold War is an example of delusional insanity.
Let's move past Twitter Senator and make a public statement on the #25thAmendment. It's time. You know it. Country before party.
Maybe Trump "pushing" their President out of the way was an early warning....
need to look under your own blanket before sticking nose in other places.
Russia-trump succeeded in the USA and you ignored it. GOP COMPLICIT. Business as usual. #retire
I hope you have the evidence. If you don't then stop making up this lie
Russia gives a fuck about Montenegro
Do something about Trump then!
It's a case study of your lies and misinformation
What are you doing to rid us of this man?
exactly maureen. we need 8 more years of never having 3% growth, like obama. liberals. hahaha.
And that was the leader Mr Trump pushed out of his way.
Now live. Our President arrives in France to take part in Bastille Day
Old fart is unwaveringly protected to democracy and different values
Yes, but you continue to support #TreasonousTrump who works for Putin!! BE A MAN, John!! Be an AMERICAN HERO! NOW!!
YOUR DELUSIONAL AND HAVE KNOW IDEA OF WHAT IS HAPPENING- GET INFORMED INSTEAD OF JUST OPINIONATED #WAKE UP

Absolutely ! Russia enemy of each and every democratic system. Interference in our election not atypical.. it is an intrusion and invasion
Meanwhile in the WH... "there is nothing to see here." #sad
#GET INFORMED INSTEAD OF JUST OPINIONATED
Now get his dog out of our house
What about Russia's work to install a Republican President and Congress. Not just Trump, @SpeakerRyan had a PAC working with Russian hackers
Step 1: Give role of commander in chief of the most powerful military on earth to Mike Pence instead of Russian puppet.
#PeoplePreferPence
Putin plan!
Sen McCain - Actually now the US is the prime case example of Putin takeover of a govt. UNLESS YOU FRIGGING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!  SMH!!!
Yet you have done nothing with your checks and balances to reign in trump
Join the club!
How about Russia's attempt to undermine OUR democracy? Do you care about that? Inaction=Complicity
How about proof?
Tell that to our President
R you just trying to agitate the snowflakes B/c @POTUS is just as concerned about Russia and the cullusion withObama and his administration
Trump knows all about this... he is involved in an ongoing criminal conspiracy to help Russia destabilize America.
FALSE. GET INFORMED INSTEAD OF JUST OPINIONATED
The real case study is watching you vote in favor of Russia after giving "strong words" against them.
When did he vote in favor of Russia?!
He undermined ours. Just look how divide we are.
Your wife's boss literally SHOVED their leader.
True, & the fact that Trump & co are still in the WH prove that no one cares that Putin tried this in the U.S.
FACT IS NOTHING FUCKIN HAPPENED & THIS IS WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STILL HERE. GO AFTER CREDIBLE EVIDENCE,  LIKE BARACK HUSSEIN O & HILLARY CL
How does that make you feel about supporting a puppet in our white house so your wife could get a job?

The push for a bipartisan repair of the ACA grew over July recess. This week, we must fight to hold onto it.
