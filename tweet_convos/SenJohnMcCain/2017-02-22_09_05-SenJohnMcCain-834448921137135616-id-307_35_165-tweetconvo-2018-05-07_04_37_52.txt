TRUTH about Rs plans to INCREASE all our costs for healthcare!> http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-healthcare-republican-dilemma-20170228-story.html … #SaveACA #HandsOffMedicare
ACA added 15million to job mkt! "Arizona’s health care and construction industries led employment growth in 2016,"
DJT has NOTHING to do w our progress! Stats today are same as Oct. His plans will hurt AZ economy!
The hatred of McCain on this thread by BOTH R&D baffles me bc he won in 2016! Opposing reasons re:support of DJT. Hmm
lots of good things happening in the country thanks to Potus Trump.much more positive if ppl like you helped Potus
DJT has nothing to do with our progress since the recession. His plans will hurt us tho for sure.
Repealing ACA would impact jobs severely. 42,000 jobs will be lost in Arizona alone and 3.4BIL in fed $. #SaveACA
It ignorance on this thread baffles me. DJT has nothing to do w our progress. His plans will hurt us!
the article even says that healthcare & construction contributed to lower unemployment rate.
Yes, because of Trump. Give credit where it's due.
DJT has nothing to do w progress! Stats now same as Oct. He will hurt our economy.
Sure, record confidence in the economy is purely coincidence 
Post is in relation to AZ. If you read the article it explains the upswing we've been having.  @SenJohnMcCain @azcentral
.@SenJohnMcCain @azcentral You can expect some drop in tourism due to the actions of President Trump.
We shld expect a decrease in Tourism, Healthcare, Trade, & Commerce in AZ bc of DJT plans.
ACA added 15million to job mkt! "Arizona’s health care and construction industries led employment growth in 2016,"
Why don't you get on CNN and other and brag about this. This is only place I have seen you say anything
Thank you, President Obama! @POTUS44
DJT has nothing to do w our progress. Stats now same as Oct. His plans will hurt our economy!
Thanks to our new @POTUS, you know the one you bash at home and abroad

BASHES our @POTUS who's creating jobs & prosperity & then wants to take credit. It sounds just like him. #traitors @azcentral
DJT has nothing to do with our progress since the recession! Smh.

No thanks to you! Please RESIGN! Badmouthing our @POTUS while abroad was obamian
@realDonaldTrump  John, what was your contribution? Did you work with President Trump?
until @potus mass deportations hurt border economy and break up families.
I hope you're not suggesting YOU had anything to do with it. Some lies are too disgusting; even for politicians!
Because of @realDonaldTrump not you U old Globalist #tcot
greater news would be if you would keep your promise and step down. We need a republican senator. A real one
#CNNLeaks hope McCain, Lindsay, @JohnKasich are exposed tmrw for the duplicitous shills they really are. @JamesOKeefeIII @VP
why were you hitting up Russia for campaign donations but being town cryer for #Fakenews trying to link trump??!
Who get credit for AZ economy? 8 yrs of Obama or a few weeks for Trump? #obama
Where are the investigations into Flynn and this administration's ties to Russia? #DoYourJob #russiagate #russianhacking
you only like Russia when seeking campaign donations (2008)? Leave the Party, you're a divider.
Sen. Mc Cain with all due respect for fighting for our country, please realize that Pres. Trump KNOWS what Americans want!!!
RINO!! EXPEL MCCAIN!
when and where is your next town hall?  #TownHall #stophiding
when and where is your next town hall?
.@SenJohnMcCain @azcentral I miss the days when AZ was the best kept secret in the USA!
u are a piece of work.
Have you ever read constitution? Specifically the Emoluments Clause? What are you waiting for? Impeach NOW.
You do realize this is most likely in part at least from renewed #market enthusiasm led by the #Prez you've been badmouthing?
Is this solicitation of money by your campaign from Russians authentic?
Will you call for an @FBI investigation?
Wow what a traitor you are to America - you were 50 years ago and still are today.  Shame on you!
Thank you Trump for easing regulations. Oh John, what this about you asking for donations from Russia?!? Hmmm
Is it true that you sought financial support in 2008 from Russia?
thank Trump, don't thank McCain.
Take a ride on your AZ highways. There are parts of I40 from Kingman to Flagstaff that are teeth rattling. HORRIBLE!!!!!
you don't return calls
RECALL @SenJohnMcCain  YOU ARE THE SWAMP
--- you need to give some  credit to @realDonaldTrump
maybe you should think your president
Please show your president the respect he deserves.  If you cannot support him then do the honorable thing and resign.
The whole country's economy will boom again. Why? POTUS  Please jump on the Trump Train
Thanks for standing up for the press and against POTUS!
Kind of the opposite of w #trump saying abt effects of immigrants
well with all the ICE raids and planned deportations I'm not sure this stat will last long.
Russia turned down your request for a donation when u were running for president in 2008.Songbird liar
We all appreciate your sevice to our country and respect that. I don't believe your Service as a Senator is uniting or wanted
can you support this?
Why do you act like you care about AZ?When is the last time you really did?Support our President and work with him

Hey John, so why did you ask the Russian Ambassador in 2008 for money to fund your president campaign?
your hated by your own party... sellout
Congratulations...
how about some tax revenues for education, mental health, and roads???
Sir you can thank Pres. Obama
no thanks to you, trait9.
http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/02/wow-wikileaks-document-shows-john-mccain-requested-donations-russians/ … Explain yourself John!
Why did John McCain go to Syria? Probably to plot the destruction of America. Republicans are terrorists.
Thank You Trump, Good Bye McCain. Enjoy a well deserved retirement.
It best not include jobs for some damn WALL. Please consider #25Amendment, & let Pence lead. Save your party.
suddenly u libs concern yourselves w/the constitution??? GO AWAY!! OBAMA & Hillary SHOULD BE IN Prison!!
it is great  news & U have nothing to do w/it. U R a fake leader the PPL wisely rejected in 2008. #imwithher
. @senjohnmccain @azcentral Vote to get Bannon off NSC.
get on board with ryan and trump  you have been there 2 long
hmm yes but you did nothing to get this going so stop acting like you did why didn't you help the vets
AZ would have have been the best if John McCain was a democrat . How did you stay in power for 40 years . BAD
This is due to President Trump' economic policy; don't enjoy the glory; what you did was just boycotting Pre.Trump
So why was everyone so angry they lost their senses and elected Trump? Crazy!!
Traitor. Resign now with some dignity before you are recalled and forced out
. Is it true you asked for campaign donations from Russia 2008? & rec'd donations from Soros! A Hipocrat Puppet.
OK- so why shut down Lockheed Goodyear? Why no UAS/UAV/UUV R&D here?

Nothing to do with you McCain
Strong vetting and immigration  wall a necessity
