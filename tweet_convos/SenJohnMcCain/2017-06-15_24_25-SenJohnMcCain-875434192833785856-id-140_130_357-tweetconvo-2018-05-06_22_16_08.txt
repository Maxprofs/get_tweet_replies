Two of the GOP’s most powerful figures gave a PR boost to violent Neo-Nazis rampaging across Ukraine.

John McCain and Paul Ryan Hold 'Good Meeting' With Veteran Ukrainian Nazi Demagogue Andriy Parubiy
Cute 

John McCain went to Ukraine and stood on stage with a man accused of being an anti-Semitic neo-Nazi
“Those brave men&women shuld know that they r not alone.Their friends acros the world stand in solidarity with them”
McCain with the co-founder of a neo-nazis party ! Great America.
Stop projecting, Putinbot.
Not even 1/10 for effort. Parubiy is without any doubt a self proclaimed Neonazi. Regardless of politicos idiotic libshit about Putin
That's your ignorant opinion based on Kremlin propaganda. Putin by contrast is a real Neo-Nazi. Just look at his behavior.
Oh, Is it already a month again? Rejoice! The asylum lets you have your computer day!
Do they give you antipsychotics at the St Pete troll factory?
Wow. Almost a comeback. If you buy a couple more standard text blocks your random assembly could be fun.
I've no time and patience to trade quips with you. Russia is fascist. Fascists love Russia, Russia loves fascists. Ukraine isn't and doesn't
To bad our president will not
The look says it all
Full Nazi. author of a commentary on Hitler's Mein Kampf entitled "Views from the Right". Andriy himself on cover, in Nazi dress.  Allies.
You mean Putler? Yes.
This has nothing to do with Russia, only long standing support for actual, literal Nazis in Ukraine.
Russians illegally in Ukraine then.
Maybe? That is still quite aside from and no justification of openly embracing literal neo-nazis in Ukraine. Discredits Ukranian rev.
Only "literal neo-nazis in Ukraine" are the Russian illegally invading Ukraine. Run along now, Kremlin propagandist.
Yes, Russia has neo Nazis. So does US and UK. However, Andriy is Speaker and a LITERAL card-carrying Nazi. Ukraine honors Nazis. Difference
Russia is run by Neo-Nazis. Putin himself is a Neo-Nazi as are Zhirinovsky and the other Duma criminals.
Yeah by standing wits nazis and fascists !
How about a free and prosperous USA?
Vote NO on trumpcare and fix ACA!!
This guy is a neo-Nazi. Why didn't you check him out before you met with him? Eugene Robinson in the Washington Post first wrote about this.
How does the "freedom" part of that sentiment square with your new Nazi pals?
Jihadis and Nazis, your judgment is poor...
His judgement in this case is pretty spectacular.





usin schmolitico & spiegel "articles" as evidence for fascism in russkiland, schmitty88?
That guy is literally a Nazi.
From Parubiy's great work https://awfulavalanche.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/ukrainian-parliament-leader-criticizes-american-culture/ …
Lest we forget their struggle included the Confederate flag and similar white racist symbols  https://www.democraticunderground.com/10024629886 
They are literally wearing Nazi regalia. Almost got their funding cut for it

Good to see, Senator.
Ukraine should be getting greater military aid to help in their defense against Russian territorial expansionism too.
Only fools like you believe the US and the likes of McCain care about democracy and freedom
But will your President
I hope McCain was alert and wide awake for this meeting
Get on the stick McCain !!
# Hoezo gratis en vrij, idioot, wij de Nederlanders , Europa betalen de rekening , grote smiecht rot op NAVO
# Looser you are a Looser MC Cain
Mc.Cain looking after the White House terrorists interests in #Ukraine #GulfCrisis #ISIS
With #Nazi?
Blahblahblah
Unfortunately Germany and France don't have the same vision
The present Ukraine gov't was put into place by a coup d'Etat by the US gov't, as I understand it. Sen. McCain was in favor of the coup.
With Nazi, tell the truth
Old white people talking to other old white people. It's not politics, it's a retirement home.
Yep...paling up to Neo-Nazis is about your style...along with those Islamic Jihadi Terrorist leaders in both Libya & Syria.
дебил и маразматик - как они вообще разговаривают??)
Belongs in a nursing home, not in the senate.
Always nice to catch up with your Ukrainian Neo-Nazi buddies !!
Heil Hitler!
Nothing changes. Nazis have a long history of engagement with the US.
Senator John McCain is crazy for meetings with #Nazi's #NeoNazi's, #Isil / #Isis bosses,as long he can sell weapons. He don't care.
Work with us call us now God bless America call us now God bless America
More needs to be done about the brutality in Chechnya!
- McCain, Why are you meeting with literally Neo-Nazis in Ukraine? Just like the terrorists in Libya/Syria ...
You do know the guy is a hardcore Nazi? I thought US is against fascism..
The traitor and his puppets
Wow,McCain is looking like more of a president then trump is,I thought I would never say that coming from a former leftist 2 an independent
Meeting with Nazis again
You were very rude to Kamala Harris! Shame on you
How about working for a prosperous USA! Stop hindering the President and get on board. This division is rediculouse!
No on wealthcare
Nice talk.  Now push to investigate Trump's collusion with Putin.
Except when you let Russia waltz in to Crimea
You are a fraud.
Back away from CrowdStrike and the Ukraine and get back to work. We saw you at that hearing. Have a milkshake and a nap.
Senator, you were NOT elected by the people of Ukraine (I hope)
John McCain is....
paruby is a known neonazi.
you should be ashamed and resign.
Suprised you aren't meeting with your benefactor Soros.
Make a deal with Syrian rebels. Help them beat regime & rid of foreign forces. In return they need to go to Ukraine & help Ukrainian Army..
McCain has already made a dirty deal with al Qaeda to overthrow Assad. They failed.
Hey, you are not well informed and not accurate at all. He is trying to support the military defectors rebels: "THE FSA" FREEDOM fighters!!
annexation of crimea is important for US due to geopolitical reason and nothing more .Why don't u support Yemen from #saudi occupation ?!!
Mr Senator, many thanks for your unwavering support to #Ukraine! God bless you.
Are you in town or is this old?
You stand with everyone exceept @POTUS   Something wrong
How you stand , again!
So secret he is smiling for pictures!
They would make a lovely NATO ally. To bad Russia uses their oil control to prevent this.
More "talk". Why aren't you pressing about stealth R platform change re Ukraine? Who did it? Why? You are an armchair senator
U only care about Ukraine cause of Russian. Once their role is over you'll dump them, like Afghanistan. U armed the jihadees and left them
SO, WAS THIS A SECRET MEETING??? DOES THE @FBI KNOW ABOUT IT??  DOES @POTUS KNOW??  DID YOU RECORD YOUR MEETINGS?? @CLewandowski_ @FoxNews
Ukraine will always reliable ally to U.S.  
F-the Nazi loving, terrorist supporting, traitorous McCain and you .
Damn it's a good thing you never got elected President
Hey nit wit how about you pay attention to the good ole USA and start sticking up for @realDonaldTrump
This Country is being torn apart by left wing Dems and MSM hate. Why don' you stay and fix this
Till it comes to a vote. Then you vote whatever Trump/Mitch wants. Maybe they sedate you on the days you vote.
WTF, McCain?  Your WIFE is now being offered a position w/ the Trump WH? In exchange for WHAT??  I thought you couldn't be bought. Just sad.
You are a champion and true friend of Ukraine.
Respect! @SenJohnMcCain
Mmmm
Guile #eurobet
Thank you Senator McCain. My grandparents came from Ukraine.
You need to retire.
Great meanwhile you go along with taking healthcare away from millions of Americans. Get your priorities straight or go back to sleep.
Really? Is that why ur wife went to work for Putin's puppy?
Then make sure there are no agents of or anyone compromised by Russia in the White House.
Did you interrupt them too??? Oh wait, they were WHITE MEN!
Then why don't you stand for your own POTUS?
Sure you will, unless Russia takes over
U seem to be sitting though.... 
They have no idea what U R talking about but then neither do U. An  embarrassment. U need to be shut down. @realDonaldTrump
After how you treated Senator Harris at a hearing you were not required to attend, it's obvious that you're senile & must retire!
How about you and your colleagues toning down the rhetoric. People are getting hurt by the whacko birds you incite. #WitchHunt
hi left hand, meet your right hand

Trump campaign guts GOP’s anti-Russia stance on Ukraine
Neonazi scum
Putin? Totally.
Pookraine it's a failed state and should be annexed by Russia
U R  making Trump and Putin mad, Senator. But we are with you.
Did you let them talk?
-It'll be closed..mini theng. Just like Greece..goodbye to navyman. Rt102,18.
But Trump wants to give Ukraine to Russia and your wife will be serving in HIS state department appointed by HIM. So whats going on?
That wasn't a meeting Senator, those 2 men were there to wash you and clean up the house.  There's a railing in the shower now.  Gonna be ok
You hate Russia to much dude!
How're you feeling today, Senator?
- while my wife takes a job working for this Admin that is tied to Russia.  I talk a good game though.
But you throw softball questions when it comes to investigations of trump/russia? 

Ya. Sure.
No problem with Ukraine, but still interested in the Manafort-connection.
Thanks for meeting with Ukraine Speaker, Sen. McCain!!
What! Ukraine used to be a soviet satellite.  investegate investegate investigate
Ukraine and Russia are enemies since Russia invaded and annexed Crimea
he he, well that is the american version of events, coup never happened
Russians changed Republican's stance on Ukraine on their platform during the convention if you are not aware !
Where does Trump stand on a free and prosperous Ukraine?
NOTE TO FILE: Russia collusion story so "phony" that 98 Senators just voted not to trust Trump to deal with Russia sanctions
-it'll be worked around..
Thanks for your service Senator, now please step down.  You've become a joke.
And healthcare for all Americans?
