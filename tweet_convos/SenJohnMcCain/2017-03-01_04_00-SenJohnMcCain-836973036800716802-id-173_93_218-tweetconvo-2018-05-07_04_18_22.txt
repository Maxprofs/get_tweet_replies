Nope, I won't be watching, but perhaps people in a airport restrooms where #CNN's audience is might watch.
I have the utmost respect for #johnMccain and #LindseyGraham. Thank you for a great town hall. That's coming from a DEM.
disappointed in both of you.
Thank You Senator McCain

@SenJohnMcCain @DanaBashCNN It's only fitting that they go on a #veryphonyfake news network. Two emasculated senators who couldn't win.
@SenJohnMcCain @DanaBashCNN I'd rather watch paint dry.
@SenJohnMcCain @DanaBashCNN @FoxNews both r out dated senators. Time to retire
@SenJohnMcCain @DanaBashCNN Will not get me to watch promoting these two has been Trump bashers.
@SenJohnMcCain @DanaBashCNN why won't CNN bring in Republicans other than team #savetheswamp? Sen Graham was 17th out of 17!
@LindseyGrahamSC what is wrong with you fellas?  Looking to be laughing stock of Rep Party?  You win.
Exactly where you two liberals belong.
@SenJohnMcCain @DanaBashCNN Williams be expecting something significant from @LindseyGrahamSC and McCain #russianhack #Emoluments NOW!

Renegade Republicans. They might as well be Democrats. One is senile and one nuts.  Do not think they will be re-elected.

#CNNTownHall  Ready. Set. CNN talks to Bizarro repubs Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham
Let the warmongering begin.
nice to see #fakenewsCNN with 2 guys who care more about media attention than their voters @SenJohnMcCain @GrahamBlog
Don't they make a cute couple. #gaylove
Not bin a million years would I waste my time listening to these neocon haters.  McCain belongs in straight jacket!
2 worthless pols.  Congrats.
It figures these two would appear like this.
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN oh yea bash Trump. They wanted him, now you got him.so th least they can do is realize the mistake.
Losers who wanted crooked Hilary, and have shown no loyalty.
how do these two keep getting elected???
Maybe Dana should respond to America and ask herself " Why am I doing this town hall; and for whom? " #obviousbias
WHO CARES WHAT U 2 HAVE TO SAY. TOTALLY OUT OF THINGS. NEED TO QUIT
monumental irrelevance - time to admit senility has arrived and let these old timers quietly retire. A new generation here
2 Aholes belong on CNN
No thanks, I rather eat my own organs...good luck with those two clogging the swamp!
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN John and Lindsey why can't you see that CNN is using you. Do not bash President Trump!!
I think these two might've won their last election
I will be watching! I respect these guys and know they have military and foreign policy knowledge that Potus doesn't have.
The ambiguously gay duo strikes again!
PLEASE address Russian hacks.
Dem's=McCain warmongering nutjobs.  "the Russians are coming" !  The world has gone mad.
Oh you mean Broke back Mountain!    The Dynamic DUAL.   Whose on FIRST
@NewDay @DanaBashCNN Israel Lobby lackeys @SenJohnMcCain & @LindseyGrahamSC push Israel Lobby (neocon) line vs #Russia and #Mideast!
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN sadly, both fast becoming yesterday and irrelevant
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN Who & why?
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN is CNN easing its democratiac biased position?

rename: the Misfits Ball
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC and CNN: PERFECT TOGETHER
So now - on the heels of a great address by @POTUS - neocon warmongers McCain & Graham (in concert with @CNN) will try to crap all over him.
#traitortownhall
CNN only cover de news of those who pay them money as bribe. If not true, wht happen when it come to Biafra issues?
: of course these 2 radical fruitcakes will be on. No wonder McCain ran in 08. Big part of the problem
GUESS WHO'S BACK!
Oh no!  Here comes Heckle and Jeckle. @CNN @DanaBashCNN
@CNNPolitics @DanaBashCNN I have to say they're some of the slightly cooler senators out there.
For the GOP anyway. Susan Collins is probably the coolest of that group though.
spoiler alert: Trump bashing session on CNN
Meanwhile I will be interviewing my neighbors dog at that time. I expect the pup to be more American and draw more people.
Tell me where I can see this amazing event.
Are these two Trump bashers joined at the hip now?
Justvrealistic.
What is your plan for when they start making sweet, passionate love to each other on camera?
Dear John McCain:  Surely you know, we can have Twice the Military at Less than Half the current Cost.   Be Honest.
That is a 30 year plan.  How can one president negotiate a 30 year plan? Forgive me, I am new at this.
swamp critters got to go
I like John McCain, but he's Dead Wrong on Military Spending.
drain these swamp critters they have to go Graham needs to stay out of the bard if he works the next day
No thanks
Not interested.
