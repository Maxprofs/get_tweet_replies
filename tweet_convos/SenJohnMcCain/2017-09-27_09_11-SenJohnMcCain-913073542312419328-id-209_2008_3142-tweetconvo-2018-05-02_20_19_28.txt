Oh my u need to stop  they have no ports to port at building the ports is FIRST
Two out of three main ports are open, plus navy bases. Bad excuse. One port is open since Saturday. Also ppl waiting in #PuertoRico from TSA to open a second AirPort. This is inaction. Thanks @SenJohnMcCain for his efforts. Only decent person in GOP
Just sitting there waiting like I said u have to build ports first then roads more ships is not needed yet
Roads need to be cleaned not built, ports need to be cleaned not built, that's the need ppl is asking for, for the federal government to send the army machinery to clean up. Don't be an idiot and do research of both sides. Why is that hard to accept they did more for TX and FL?
So I was right we don't need the ships fake news
@POTUS RESCIND THE JONES ACT NOW......oh if you don't know what rescind means....it's reverse, repeal, 
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for urging the Trump admin to lift the Jones Act for #PuertoRicoRelief. Now, do it!
Thanks for standing up for right
#JonesAct #Repeal @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan #DoTheRightThing #HelpPuertoRico
PR or its infrastructure is not going to be rebuilt in 10 days.
Which one law they r talking abt...
FDA bans Kinder Eggs, original, because non food inside,though law paid by US candy co./Cracker Jacks? Nuts with desiccant, etc. ridiculous
We are allowing Americans to drown and die of thirst. This is not who we are, but this IS who Trump is.

#impeachTrumpnow
In order to prevent another 45, We first have to realize that this IS who many of "us" are. He couldn't have been elected otherwise
Maybe 'us' will realize after America has fully crashed & burned: bullshit artist/big mouth bigots make poor 'presidents'.
Don't be so judgemental, but didn't the people of PR voted to be independent from US!
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain. Congress must act now to help PR! No excuses! Many of us live in the US and VOTE!!
It's not just worsening the current crisis, sir. It has hamstrung economic growth for decades. Repeal could wipe out PR debt completely.
@SenJohnMcCain #RealAmericanHero @realDonaldTrump #Fake45 https://twitter.com/2shaester/status/912631668401246208 … #ImpeachTrump RT
@SenJohnMcCain endured 5 1/2yrs as prisoner of war, including torture. 1968 refused early release, because it meant leaving others behind RT 
Sen McCain you truly make a difference in the lives of those in need.
Hey Sen. McCain: Tell us you support Chinese and Russian ships supplying US ports. Should they make our bullets for us, too? #retireMcCain
Sir. Are we keeping it out for ever though?
The Jones Act promotes maritime security. Only mainstream media would get maritime info from an AZ senator.
My opinion only-
Maintain the Jones Act but allow this temp waiver
PR build a small fleet of transport ships and get fabulously wealthy
Nice job Senator McCain!
We have ridiculous, outdated laws. Jones Act is one. Instead of cruise ships traveling Seattle-Alaska, they must stop in Canada. $$ lost
"its trump act"  not caring for other nationality..!
 Thank you @SenJohnMcCain .#PuertoRicoReliefNOW .
At the very least, waive the regulations. Get help to these people. I thought there was a navel base on the island?
People should read first. Jones Act granted PRicans to be American citizens. Suspended this act will mean that PRicans are not Americans ?
Trump is worsening it. Get your act together and get rid of this Moron In Chief
.As usual follow the money, who's getting rich over the implementation of the Jones Act v-a-v the dire situation in Puerto Rico? 
Unfortunately Trump doesn't have enough nads to do the right thing for PR.
When are we going to served aid there? This is unheard of tragedy and a repulsive back-turning on our people in trouble! What's going in?
Do you ever get tired of being a hero sir? @SecElaineChao fam profits from this. Can congress move for waiver? More conflicts of interests
He’s an evil man whose only agenda is to do us harm. How many more people have to suffer under this fascist dictator traitor? Remove now.
Hon McCain all the #JonesAct does is force aid to US ships which only raises prices on a bankrupt #PeurtoRico. This is wrong America.
Hon McCain, the #JonesAct was lifted a week before the hurricane hit Florida, it was lifted for Texas, we got a humanitarian crisis looming
I read the article. I could not believe what I was reading. The Act should be dumped in light of what Puerto Rico is going through.
You are a Marverick! You're in my prayers! God is a miracle working God! Thanks for making a difference in the lives of the voiceless!
Beautiful shade.
Is there really any doubt? @POTUS WON'T help Americans in #PuertoRico; #JonesAct means other nations CAN'T. Why waive for TX, FL not PR?
Thank you Senator McCain for speaking up while rest of your party looks silently on as people are dying
Funny he doesn't follow any other laws!
Fight!
Correct me if I am wrong. The Jones act has been suspended in the past to help victims of disasters. Why is it diff now? rumps friends? #USA
Mr McCain, it's nice to have you on the side of kindness and empathy. Isn't it sad that that there are sides to this?
PR devastation #Irma #Maria, common sense urgency vs. Trump/cabinet abuse of taxpayers for golf, Mara Lago, private jet trips, sound booth!
"]many say"? Really? Not obvious enough how it results in humanitarian crisis?
Because it is! It's unconscionable that Congress is doing nothing!
The Jones Act is a BS excuse!  The items being shipped aren't for consumer goods...it's for vital life saving items for US citizens!
Trump lifted in for Texas & Florida, not Puerto Rico. Why he went bankruptcy on his golf course there & left tax payor & investors with nada
Worry about the Jones act later these desperate ppl need help now.fuck the rules ppl ar dying there no act should hold this up.only trump is
WTH is wrong with your party??
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain you keep serving up big for this world & country.  Be the President that Trump can't be sir. #Leadership
The crazies are out again
Is this worse than Graham Cassidy? The Republican Party has become an empty shell of humanity. McConnell still wants to kill Obama care.
It's those humans trusted with implementing Jones Act that are the problem. Everything has a "work-around".
Shut up Mccain and just go away!
It was waved for Harvey and Irma
This is ridiculous 
#TrumpsKatrina
In a military theme school Trump got a medal for neatness.....
Thank you, @SenJohnMcCain for your diligence, your compassion, your determination, and your heroic service to this country.  Sincerely, Don

Can you nudge Trump and tell him to repay 33 million to Puerto Rico's economy?
Buried in debt. Drought in recession. Can't file chapter 9 legally. Trump you understand that one. Pay more for food has to be shipped twice
PR is attacked by 2 hurricanes, forecasted several days in advance. Why wasn't the relief air bridge & ship armada ready to role a week ago?
He waived it for Texas and Florida. What does that tell you?
Why aren't relief supplies & resources being shipped in US Navy ships? Where is US military? This is Trump's Katrina. Both on GOP watch!
Yes...but the shipping industry...
Puerto Rican's pay taxes & have no voice...sounds familiar. The monarchy didn't care If the colonies starved. Is that USA today #EndJonesAct
Time to show your mettle, @SenJohnMcCain  -intro emergency legislation to repeal the Jones Act. The nation rallied for you, pay it forward.
Hawaii, Alaska & US island territories are forced to pay domestic tariffs on all goods coming from a US port to protect maritime industry!
If it was waived for Texas and Florida it needs to be waived for Puerto Rico.
Please lead an override resolution on the Jones Act.  This is despicable- and Trump's reason that shipping won't like it is irrelevant.
GET RID OF THE JONES ACT.
Thank you sir. Bless you. #Patriot
is Jones Act something President could suspend via ExOrder until Hurricane crisis averted? Or can LegislativeBr do it alone?
Keep fighting the good fight!
@SenJohnMcCain you have to get the @HouseGOP to impeach. How much more must we endure?
Repeal it.  Protecting shippers while citizens die?  WTF?
Fix it Senator, there's American citizens dying!
It is sir, but disorganization is crippling too. They could use some SeaBees, logisticians, CA and traffic control units. And right soon!
Lift the JonesAct! How ridiculous can potus be?
Political bosses abuse their power to choose economic winners and losers

Economic planners create more unintended consequences
I support your call for waiver of Jones Act Flag requirement, but don't attempt to repeal it because it provides remedy for injured seamen.
He is no deal maker. He is a failure.
4get all red tape & bureaucracy, just get the problem fixed first, deal with the paperwork & policies afterward
@SenJohnMcCain i have been a democrat all my life. I respect you most as the person across the aisle. Thank you for your service
What is the asshole act?  Oh thats the new on formed by john mccain.  #termlimits
The law ought to be abolished.
Suspend the Jones Act for Puerto Rico the way it was suspended for Texas and Florida!
@elizabetm1 @NBCNews Please give Trump a wake up! This is beyond cruel. What's wrong with Trump?
Sir: Next time you are in South Bend, IN, I would love you to have dinner at my home.  It's a modest home, but your courage awes me.
Who cares about the stupid act?! TRUTH - Trump has the authority to waive it, he HAS the power to help, but he doesn't want to
You mean this was quickly waived for fuel after Harvey/Irma, but hasn't been for food and water? Por favor!
Thank you for helping!  My family in Levittown, Toa Baja is struggling and family in Rincon has no gas or diesel to get help to them.
There is loads of food sitting at the port just sitting there ...why isn't anyone getting it to the people
It's time to alter the Jones Act and allow other countries' ships help us help Puerto Rico!
It.  Should be revoked permanently. Ridiculous for them to pay 2-3 x the cost of what it is in the US.  They are Americans.
Jones Act should not impede humanitarian aid. No.
LIFT ALL THE BULLSHIT & SEND IN THE AIRCRAFTS, HELICOPTERS, SHIPS - 3.5 MILLION AMERICANS IN PUERTO RICO / NO WATER, FOOD, GAS, ELECTRICITY
Some more history of the Jones Act from @planetmoney http://goo.gl/a5UTbZ 
tRump tweets about #DallasCowboys and Jerry Jones instead of #JonesAct?
Thank you for fighting for our citizens in Puerto Rico!
@eye2winner @NBCNews So I see #McCain is still channeling #TedKennedy.. #RinoCoward
The Jones act is so much more than stated in the article. It can be temporarily lifted but not repealed
What a shame. You have been trying to kill US maritime jobs and shipyards for decades. RETIRE do the nation a favor
Why do we have Puerto Rico anyway?
at up to $9.8b/yr in created debt it pretty much caused the PR economic crisis. ask Hawaii and Alaska, they also suffer, altho not as much
One of my favorite @planetmoney podcast episodes was actually much more informative about #JonesAct http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/03/12/289116345/episode-524-me-and-mr-jones …

What makes you want to Chang it now?
Urgent:
Colombian freighter with fuel and supplies not allowed to dock!!!
This is absurd !!!
Why the waiver of Jones act to Sept 22 only?. Must waive for PR now.
#TrumpsKatrina
Hillary will be right beside them!
So you let this 1920 law stay on the books after your decades in office?
Sen McCain, USAF C-17s (built in America) can provide immediate humanitarian & medical relief. Where are they? @AirMobilityCmd
Look:
Trump lost confidence in his penis as a child and we've been paying for it ever since. https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/913103281672658944 …
Heehee! Think you're right cuz some thing's very wrong!
What is Obamacare?  The single largest entitlement placed on taxpayers backs in the history of our great nation. AND it too is worsening.
GO HOME!!!!!
A great read for those of us who didn't understand the complexities of the Jones Act.
#AmericanGenocide #AmericanGenocide #AmericanGenocide #AmericanGenocide #AmericanGenocide #GetWoke #StayWoke #TheResistence
Disgraceful to enforce in critical situation existing in Puerto Rico!
George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have touted it as crucial to national security as it reduces America's dependency on foreign-owned vessels.
McCain is a second guessing back stabbing rhino. Ain't got a clue about what is going on.
Thank you for bringing this to everyone's attention. We appreciate your leadership and your compassion. You are a man of true honor.
Aside from the fact that US Navy & Coast Guard meet the requirements- Texas has 1 flagged Vessel, too. So- who ferries workers to oil rigs?
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for pushing this issue to get help for #PuertoRico. Next: repeal antiquated #JonesAct that hurts PR econ!
@SenJohnMcCain  THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for what you have done for #ACA and now #PuertoRico. You are one of the good ones GBY

The Jones Act is Trumps excuse to not pay Puerto Rico $33 Million! He bankrupted that island & is walking away AGAIN!!!
Hey, the little people are only there to make the mean little man richer.
THEY SHOULD HAVE EVACUATED...THEY SHOULD HAVE INSURANCE...AFFORDABLE OR NOT, BUY IT ANYWAY...JUST LIKE ACA
Make it go away!!! Puerto Ricans are Americans. Not foreigners.
Ridiculous that our so called government has to argue while people die! These deaths are on our governments hands!!!
Really, the JonesAct?  What about illegals, you know the people here against the law?
If Arizona had shipyards would @SenJohnMcCain be opposing the Jones Act ? #AmericanMade
PR wants all the US benefits without contributing. They receive federal funding and do not pay taxes. Either be a state or on your own.
This is not a conversation to be had at the moment. #PuertoRico *is* part of the U.S., help was promised by Trump far ahead of the storm!
Btw, the U.S. sends humanitarian aid to all '4 corners of the world'...places who don't pay U.S. taxes! How 'bout that? #helppuertoriconow
Lies McCain tells to get Paid. https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10155613073773886&id=27223368885 …
The fact that the govt pissed away a lot of money and were irresponsible has a lot to do with it... you been there in the last 5 Years?
But the article you linked basically says it should be waived for reasons other than relief efforts.
@AnaSolitaria7 @NBCNews I wish you were the GOP president right now! Not happy you voted for DeVos, but really I respect you.
Lol
So my question is...Are we in danger of German ships attacking our ships if we try to sail over and help our territory? Can you answer?
Why would the CONGRESS keep these things from them? Can you answer?
in to their ports of supplies of what they desperately need to rebuild and supply their peoples with food, water, medical and so on.
what change your mind ?
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing & Replacing O'Care. My oh my has he changed-complete turn from years of talk! 
Senator John McCain, Mayor of San Juan needs immediate marching orders for our troops that are already their.
#bringillegaldrugstoPRafterhurricanemakePRgreatagain
#senJohnMcCainOurHeroAgain
#PuertoRico Pleasesign & share
We read the Jones Act. The Senate and or the CONGRESS can go over the POTUS "head" and allow ships to pass so that Puerto Rico can get ships
We here in Hawaii would like to see it gone for good. Old law, doesn't fit anymore.
Waiver, yes.  Repeal, no.  Attempt to repeal and it will look like you are using humanitarian crisis to further an agenda.  You're not, are you?
He is no hero just a scumbag
Thank you for your work to at least waive the Jones Act in this emergency.
Write up a rescind and get it in front of 45 and everyone take it to him...no countryman left behind, sir
Puerto Rico is kidnapped by the US government @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump
WTF?!?! Did they doctors accidentally remove your testicles and give them to Obama? Why have you turned into a traitor of America?
Healthcare delayed due to you
Shouldn't stop a flotilla of American Yachts from loading up emgcy supplies and delivering
Exactly!
it is not helping them at all and Trump can do something about that so why won't he?!!!  

Thank you Senator!!
Songbird McCain. Why do vets hate him?
Time to draft legislation to get rid of this awful law.
How helping US Citizens is a political event, I'll never comprehend. All patriots must call for the removal DT, he is destroying the USA.
Donald Trump saved you and your I'll from a bloody revolution where you urine throwing children would have certainly lost
thank you for setting politics aside in times of life and death.  A true leader you are sir.
Trump left PR 33 million in debt. This is all about TRUMP. Get it yet?
Clue less
Where is your HEALTH PLAN REPEAL LIAR!!!!  DRAIN THE SWAMP
Keep pushing for the Jones Act repeal, sir.
One Vote Johnie step down.  Talking trash again. Pick up phone call POTUS. No balls just talk Bozo  typical RINO in place step down
#TrumpsPuertoRicanGenocide
I looked up this act which was instated after WW1. Hear me WW1. Don't understand why no one is addressing Archaic act. Maybe it needs update
Like the outdated electoral college that got us this bozo in the White House
Better than having a long stealing Clinton Who sold plutonium to our enemies
Send Medical Ships and evacuate Puerto Rico! Hospitals and chronically ill people and children need brought to the mainland!
Thank you for caring.. decent Republicans like yourself are far and few between..
Lol they are a DIEING breed

Why won't your GOP colleagues step in Senator? How is this a partisan issue? People are dying!
McCain is a shameful man
The reality is that the US would have zero domestic operators without it. Preserves critical infrastructure exactly for times like these.

John, @fema disagrees with you. Says this would not help at all.

interesting... I'm beginning to understand what's going on here. Thanks 
Stay with it. You have support on this issue. No US state or territory should be limited to thrive in a tough world economy. Let's Roll!!
It's tough because of McCain and hilliary and obama
 what?
Nevermind - bot
Thank you Senator! Many Americans are unaware of PR's economic plight. 50% do not even know that they are US BORN citizens. Maybe DJT too?
Drugs! Idiota
The government assessment that determined the island’s ports are too damaged to handle an increased import capacity.
So fly them to a ship to get them out. We have done it before. That's why we have military. Foreign and domestic. Trump is refusing the help
You are a traitor step down
What is wrong with your fellow Rs?? Why are they continuing to enable an unfit, harmful decisive maniac?
: #SenMcCain... It's not about the #JonesAct... Just as #POTUS mentioned #PuertoRico was hit by #Irma first...
Instead of complaining about it. Do something. Isn't that your job?
It is part of the United States of Americathis law is goi g against the people of Puerto Rico.
You're going to have to convince Trump. He's the one who's punishing Puerto Rico bc of a grudge over a failed property on the island.
Plus, he’s shown how much he cares about brown people.  

Retire please
Delete your account please
Thank you sir.
