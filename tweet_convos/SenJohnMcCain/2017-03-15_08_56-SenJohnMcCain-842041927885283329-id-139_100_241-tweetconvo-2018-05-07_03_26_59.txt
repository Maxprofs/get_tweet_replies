.@SenJohnMcCain you're the one who let @realDonaldTrump sell out US sov to Russia! #GOParetraitorsall
as a bleeding heart liberal I have to admit I admire a Republican with integrity. It's rare today Thank you Senator McCain
"Bleeding heart liberals" for WWIII???  Get some common sense!
Everyone should endeavor to find a spouse that looks at them the way you look at unnecessary wars.

Putin drove me to the polls.
Then you need to #ImpeachTrump because @realDonaldTrump is #PutinsPuppet

Only McCain supporters I see here are far Leftists.Called U a Dem in Repub seat for years. Obviously TRUE!
most syrians support Assad and thank russia & despise US killing their people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNTgL82D4Xo … @SenJohnMcCain @walid970721 @HKX07
and that it was a strategic decision to ignore the genocide in Syria. It appears Trump is continuing that policy.
Thank you!
How about you handing out anti tank missles to extremists? You are the one who should be condemned for your dangerous action.
there would be no civil war to begin with if u didn't supply rebels aka terrorists with weapons
armless ppl were shot at by the regime before armed groups were formed & the West "armed" them
Thank you for your service to our country and our democracy. Thank you for standing up to Russia!
Thank you for being a gullible schmuck.
Israeli F16s/F35a able to strike Assad positions throughout Syria,suggesting Obama's pretext of Assad air defenses was bogus

Senator, why would you wait 6 years. All of our politicians must respond to issues in a timely manner...
#Syrian mess result of Israel Lobby agenda vs #Syria pushed by Israel Lobby lackey @SenJohnMcCain: http://america-hijacked.com/2012/02/12/israel-lobby-pushes-for-us-action-against-the-syrian-government/ …
Deals that created support and assistance to the "rebels" helped funnel weapons into those you thought you knew, but didn't.

#FullRepeal
This grandpap is senile
Vietcong must bury alive and world will be grateful
Are you going to support @TulsiGabbard #StopArmingTerrorists bill or nah?
you are so not in touch with reality anymore! take some pills or read some objective news.
We'll McCain did ask Russians for political contributions but alas McCain is  Soros puppet.
Worry about the US!!
why don't you put some effort into immigration reform, tax reform, improving infrastructure, improving education.
Day late and a dollar short, just like your stand against our narcissistic president!
If McCain the media whore was aware how much people hate every thing he stands for on the right and left he would be afraid
Slaughter in Syria is a high price to pay for a gas pipeline from Qatar to Turkey.
Have you lost your marbles @SenJohnMcCain ? 

Assad, Russia, and Iran are the only forces keeping #ISIL from spreading further. #Syria
How much did the #Saudis pay you John?
Exclusive video after McCain's meeting with the Saudis:
#establishment McCain sold out long ago... and couldn't even win in 2008
You have a hellava nerve, since you are one of the architects of this fiasco. NOTHING remains hidden, you foolish man.
You will be exposed for the depraved TRAITOR to humanity that you are. Watch & weep! #GameOver #TuckItAndRun #Fool #Glutton
You supported bombing montenegro in the 90s...did putin make you do it?
so Assad won't play the NOW so you want to ruin their country? AMERICANS will not help your buddies destroy anymore
Paul Ryan is turning on your criminal club. He is turning on you because like you, he can't be trusted.same character as you
everyone knows it's not a civil war. It's a war against terrorist and you're arming and funding the terrorists.
No legislation banning support ISIL/Al Qaeda? Banning weapons for ISIL/ISIS? Banning money for CIA training for ISIL / ISIS?
US responded by arming al-Qaeda and Isis along with your partners turkey and Saudi Arabia
Could you just go ahead and stop trying to start every war you can imagine? Kthx
Who's responsible for Aug 21, 2013 Ghouta sarin gas attacks? MSM does not report the #falseflag story. Blame #Assad more war
The propaganda created by the west is sickening. Still playing the same narratives to drive support for US intervention.
Wow, @SenJohnMcCain This is weird seeing that you meet with ISIS in secret. But @RandPaul works for Russia? You're ISIS's leader...
thanks a lot. U.S. less safe now
how long will this take for you to get this done.  Another year.What about #SomaliaDrought How do you sleep at night.  WTF
.@SenJohnMcCain Don't bother. We no longer listen to u. America is  done w/ur twisted war games. Retire now & pray u don't end up in prison.
Thank you all for telling the truth about Russia & the displacement of millions of people. We need to ban the Ban.
When will YOU realize too many Americans have DIED for Muslims..Enough with your shit Johnny
you lost the presidency, so shut up and go away
A resolution is nothing more than a political statement. Get busy and join the Republican party.
While I hate to see the children suffer, I'm not sure we're improving things.
.@SenJohnMcCain @TulsiGabbard @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Peace Group ; NATO & U.S. Spreading 'Disinformation on Syria'
so you want my marine son and his brothers to go and die in the midst of a civil war? Retire you old fool.
.@SenJohnMcCain @TulsiGabbard @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Syrian man confronts BBC reporter for Lying
Is anyone more deserving of a massive spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage than @SenJohnMcCain ??
It must really chap your ass that your precious jihadis are being defeated. You are a warmongering lunatic @SenJohnMcCain
What is your relationship with Moderate Syr Rebels? What is UR relationship with Oleg Deripaska? RICO, Russian MOB?
thank you to each of the Senators supporting this resolution. More must be done to help innocent Syrians
pathetic and clueless come to mind
Thank you. My prayers are for your success.
You're itching to start a war with Russia ...but you have your bunker in Wash. for you and your family ...we have nothing.
Go fly another jet into the ground McCain. You never met a war you didn't want to get the US into.
#candyass
GOPers speculated on SYRIA-massacre theme, blaming OBAMA&called to add sanctions agnst RUS over SYRIA. 
BEFORE election. Now?
What happens if RUSSIAN ANYTHING is responsible for the death of our brave sons? And if we kill RUSSIANS?
thank you senator but I think potus is in Putin's booty .
Off target again John. ISIS is where the focus should be. Maybe Russia and Assad can help out but your globalist agenda...
if u hadn't given arms and money to ISIS none of this would be happening. They lived in peace before that!
Novel thought, if the Syrians truly want freedom let them fight for themselves.
lol.following Twitter footsteps of trump?U r 1 grouchy individual who does everything to go against trump as per soros wishes
Senator there is no war in Syria,it is popular uprising the mass want liberty but the Global Elite Want to keep the dictator
Try condemning Russia's puppet while you're at it.
The error is for not have very clarete who is our World.JFK.Lady Oscar.Steve
Back off @POTUS, McCain!  Your position is not that secure. Don't force us to really come against you politically. We WILL.
no offense, good sir, but resolutions do nothing as our troops put their lives on the line where we should not be.
Still having sex with Kids John? Your involvement with #PizzaGate is disgusting!
Senator, I'm genuinely curious, reports last week said US Marines were deployed in Syria - who have they been sent to fight?
stand up to @realDonaldTrump and be the hero we need you to be. Enough of this
Haven't we already condemned them?What other countries have written resolutions to condemn them? How does this change things?
Sen. John McCain
My previous Tweets,
S.66
didn't Trump respond with a, "Huh? Who?"
warmonger.
Condemning Russia?  Trump wants a rewrite.
Our commander-In-Chief is leveraged by Russia. What kind of response do you expect?
Thank you sir.
