Hang with him he will come around and make us proud.Better than any democrat.
Your fellow soldiers who died in your stead are rolling in their graves. You betray them with every breath you take.

you suck and have for a long time. Get behind the president
but you sold out on Betsey DeVos. Eas it worth 53,000 to screw public ed?
Let their be peace on earth and let it begin with me...
Why does Trump think walls and bans keep us safe while undermining intel community?
6 years captive in Vietnam? And u r hero? Cuold be the reason of Vietnam fail

isn't there a problem with Bannon & Miller on the National Security Council? #TheResistance
"POTUS supports me, and millions of Americans support him & his agenda," Conway tweets. #conjobway PATHOLO LIAR
McCain is the UN stooge. Manipulated by Obama from the shadows. American Traitor.
Speaking of top security, why isn't Russia and our election being discussed?  Why??
The greatest danger is in the white house #StopPresidentBannon
are you going to address the president's dangerous retoric and policies regarding our security?
Oh you mean the Islamization of America is in danger? YOU BET. Alahu Akbar!
I mean his talk about taking oil. And his talk about war with allies.

OFM. "Own Force Monitoring" is a  tool to catch American spies communicating w/our enemies. Seems we caught one. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/flynn-is-said-to-have-talked-to-russians-about-sanctions-before-trump-took-office.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0&referer=https://t.co/3XZej9UgqA …
@eu_eeas @SenateFloor @Kostarakos @CEUMCSpokespers @EU_Commission
Hey John why don't you do something about all these dam illegals protesting, blocking roads in Phx?
What about the security of our children's education? Should have voted no on DeVos. That's courage.
Top security issue may be sitting in the WH. We may disagree on a lot but I believe you to be an honorable man. Russia!
sorry to hear you took money from the DeVos family, too-you could have voted against her :  (
ThankYou Secretary Mattis for defending the honor of a soldier whos been slain,when folks disrespect his work behind his back
The only way to regain our standing in the world is to impeach the dangerous fool in the White House.
How about having your president's back instead of pandering to the DC political/media establishment.
I feel less secure when the president baits Iran on Twitter. In fact, I lose sleep over it.
I would think #1 would be the president's phone, #2 his twitter #3 unsecured server #4 his big mouth
can we start the impeachment process now due to insanity please or r u all crazy
wow-true statesman doing serious work, imagine that.Sure you don't want to demean anyone via twitter?
Good to see someone is doing some work. John those young guy's and their twitter tantrums..sad.
@AtlanticCouncil @EUintheUS @FedericaMog is it @POTUS ?
The top security challenge is you and the liberal courts trying to import terrorists!
I'm starting to think you won't remember tomorrow.
Why do you pretend to work for America?
I'm waiting for you to be the true hero. Don't roll with this wretched tide. Do something. Do MORE.
America needs @SenJohnMcCain to take on  noron  @realDonaldTrump. The next 4yrs is a disaster!
see if you can pass any of that intel on to POTUS.
The "top security challenge" is @POTUS.  Impeach him!
John McCainさん

Excellent meeting w/◯◯ today discussing top security challenges

Thank you very much

@SenJohnMcCain @EUintheUS @FedericaMog
hold firm on Russia, the country need you now more than ever.
McCain is another chicken shit. He lets Trump bully him and the rest of the GOPigs.
What of Trump's misuse of phones/computers re cybersecurity? When will we see a hearing similar to Hillary's grillings by GOP
John we love you I voted for you . Buddy it's time to retire .
screw the EU Britain in front of line now @realDonaldTrump @TheresaMayPM @Nigel_Farage
Unfortunately, Trump will sign executive orders attempting to bypass anything you came up with. @SenJohnMcCain @EUintheUS @FedericaMog
more (((neocon))) conservatism ... F...OFF John
Look at all the barking moon bats you attract!!
refreshing to see a politician who is dignified while focusing on issues rather than insulting, irrelevant, baseless Tweets.
all of these liberal tweets who are applauding you should tell you that you're on the wrong side. Time to support
McCain thank you for your continued service
We believe in you. Please save us from this unstable administration.
it's no go...

Did you discuss our biggest security threat? Donald Trump. #impeachtrump #notmypresident
what are you guys going to do about our “President”?  I mean, seriously? This can’t go on.
@POTUS Why old man Senator Potter from Arizona and Linseed are planning their elitist coup!
Can't let our game of global thermonuclear war with the Rooskies be delayed anymore!
Because a country with 1/5 the population of Europe and US and a crappy economy is...
an extestential threat to truth, justice & the American way (of MIC endless war)...
I'm 55 yo Reagan republican that hated Soviet Union which actually was a threat...
Hate to tell you they were defeated and are gone and Russia today is a rump ghost...
So stop trying to back them in a corner and risking a war with a NUCLEAR state!Dopes!
#1 on the list:  Donald J. Trump!
