News reporting Lockheed cut cost on f35 jet. Thank you President Trump.
Export/import ratio is key.  Mexico buys > than China, Japan & Germany combined.
Need to get China, Japan & Germany to 44/56 like Mexico, our amigo.
thank you Matthew, import ratio shows trade with Mx is good deal
Mexico purchases more from US than China, Japan & Germany combined.
teachers rank last in US in  pay. Our state is 47 in funding for ed. Facts are facts

Well if we left it up to you & flake AMERICANS will get screwed again.
each & ever1 of these miscreants support wide open borders. On cartel payroll
YOU ARE A TRAITOR
You both disgust me .. you are all talk .. your votes keep supporting President Bannon
you're very calm for someone whose House is on fire  #ImpeachTrump

I read your article. You have an obligation to resist Trump and his "whacko birds" now who will jettison the state of AZ.
vote NO for Sec of State and NO Betsy DeVos!!!!!
just do your job sir support the President
Then @SenJohnMcCain should join in the discussion, renegotiation and stop bashing the decision.
Does careful mean lets drag our feet?
#Please vote no on Devos she is bad for education .
I remember we were doing just fine w/o NAFTA. "Giant Sucking Sound", Ross Perot.
its about America as a whole not just one state @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @GlennHamer @AZChamber @azcentral
well at least @ForTrump is doing something.  What have you done for Americans?
Too easy ! Build a wall on Canada border too then you're all corralled!!
yeah, lets not settle for a 60 billion a year trading deficit this time
multilateral trade agreements are good for USA and businesses. We also need TPP
Do more, Senator.
. Stand aside John & watch .@POTUS show U how it's done.
Careful?  Talk to your @POTUS who running his mouth and twitter.
=ALWAYS LYIN'! @JeffFlake @GlennHamer @AZChamber @azcentral @wsj @barronsonline @ft @msnbc @greta @ap @loudobbs @RT_com @CNNI
why the jobs not in ur state
So we get screwed more
yes sir! But we do need to re-negotiate  NAFTA
-No Trumps making America Great again.
McCain for DNC chair!
Yes John God forbid we stand up for ourselves, gee we might offend someone.
20% tariff means 20% on US consumers....
What are you DOING?
McCain are you in on the "Obstruct" plan? Sure starting to look that way.
America I hope you watching this Senator McCain he truly is an AMERICAN HERO.
a 20% stmt WAS a negotiating tactic. What is wrong with U all that you can't see
What's wrong 894/899? No cheap labor for your favorite resorts?
Mexicans are more used to deprivation than Americans to high prices. Who'll win?
I'm so sick of you Republicans and your Reich.
Mr McCain why don't you help potus instead of the dems so 
agreed, this will affect so many especially farmers!
yes next time keep America in mind first! Ever hear if win win! Biz term boys!
History will remember your collaboration.
Always good to proceed with caution but it does need to be renegotiated 
This assumes Trump knows/cares what #NAFTA is/does. Your prudent advice will fall on deaf ears I'm afraid.
Put American workers and  businesses first in our country.  Nafta last! Vets
Will you please retire @SenJohnMcCain ? We are  tired of your liberal views
Oh please Bannon is going to do some horrific shit you're not even going to *try* to stop
You'll do everything and print about how it's bad and you're worried and/or afraid and then
In the end you'll get in line and do exactly what Bannon tells you to do.
Then I expect my elected officials to actively shape the changes & not in press
right. elected officials should not work in the press - just twitter
Do you ever get tired of being a RINO putting your petty jealousy over country?
Nah, figure out how to PAY FOR THAT WALL, Mr McConnellechev! Break govt get Don.
u have been wrong on just about everything and u know nothing about business.
I HOPE YOU KNOW MORE THEN WHEN YOU RUN FOR PREZ.
please protect Ukraine, our allies, & our country from Putin! @POTUS is asset!
Who you talking, we? Call #StephenMiller or #Bannon or the President to help!
keep speaking up. One of the few with guts
If he had guts he would do more than speak and write.
How about an Op-Ed on Russia shelling Ukraine right after Trump's call to Putin?
I really hope that the GOP stands up for what is good for America, not for Trump
Trump is good 4 America,the Left showing that they r the problem
