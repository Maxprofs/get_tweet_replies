Hey @SenJohnMcCain, YOU voted to confirm Tillerson; YOU knew this was coming; what's your next brilliant move?
Are they crazy? @WSJ: "Exxon Seeks U.S. Waiver to Resume #Russia Oil Venture" https://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-seeks-u-s-waiver-to-work-in-russia-despite-sanctions-1492620677 …
Well, at least Exxon's Russia-Rosneft waiver move confirms Trump's motive behind picking Tillerson as SoS… @Rosie
adam - he was tortured for years - slack is earned 

i believe in his soul 
everyone voted for EXXON/PUTIN
When you own the Govt. you get more done.
It's always about that dirty oil money, when will people learn we don't need fossil fuel's or their oil spills, we need to evolve to survive
And we are approaching that point, which is why they are so desperate.
I am convinced it's been on life-support for sometime now time to let the dinosaur go... Time for evolution
Well yes but they have been fairly delusional in their ability to keep it going.
I wonder if u and McCain thought it was crazy to Hillary and Obama to give away 20% of U.S. uranium supply to the Russians?   Hmmm....

Are they fucking serious??? 
#EnoughIsEnough
#ImpeachTrump
Did @SenJohnMcCain sell America out for Exxon oil? Appears to be when McCain turned on America, no longer seeing Russia interference  prob
Who's crazy? You are & 90% of America knows it.
They are drunk with power, and Putin called his debt due. Shockingly treasonous.
Image That .... @realDonaldTrump #Tillerson cashing in his stock options !!!
And moving on .....
Who is? McCain?
Who would have thought? Everyone who opposes Trump as President, that's who #RESISTANCE
This seems to be the whole reason Tillerson is there and the State Dept was gutted. I hope Congress will step up.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi cannot let this happen
#TheResistance vital to Democracy!
your credibility is showing, senator
No not crazy. Greedy and corrupt. If you do nothing, so are you. You talk the talk. Let's see you walk the walk.
Save the outrage John.  I didn't see you object to any of his cabinet appointments or denounce candidate DRUMPF.
Then why did you vote for Tillerson? You knew this was the agenda! Ask your question of yourself.

What did you expect?  You voted for POTUS & voted to confirm this fool
Senator...with all due respect, have you not seen this coming? What else did you expect? THIS is what the GOP has been cosigning all along!!
Exxon, Russia and the Executive Branch still think they can get away with this @SenJohnMcCain. Please make sure they cannot. #TrumpRussia
Thanks for sharing this.  Have fun always!
PLEASE Sen McCain, do something! You know most Amr dont realize this is end around to lifting sanctions & was their end game.  Fight it pls!
Yes. And greedy.
The word is TRAITOR! Selling America for their personal profits. Collision with dictators. Dictators whom kill their citizens #maga #trump
At what point will the @GOP pull its head out of @realDonaldTrump ass and see what is going on?
Are YOU crazy? What did YOU think Tillerson had in mind when YOU voted to confirm him as Secretary of State? YOU have no right to complain.
What did you think Trump had in mind when he said he wouldn't release his tax returns, would not divest himself of his business interests?
What did you think Trump had in mind when he used his office to profit -- for himself and his family? He's a crook.
Trump's already the worst president ever, & YOU had a hand in validating & enabling him. OWN IT! It's not too late to do something about it.
Is this a rhetorical? If not...then yes.
Senator, now is the time to be a Senator for the people, not Exxon or any other corporation.  Stand for us.  @AmFem101 @MillenPolitics
they are not crazy. It is abvious. This US Foreign Affairs! 
You wait and see.  Your party is going to roll over and let it happen. It is how you are emboldening Trump.
You are saying the right thing, Sen. McCain, but how will you act? We are watching, not just listening.
Oh the light just came on? Smh
This is what you get when you support Trump. You can't be that naive to think this wouldn't happen.  Q is, what's congress going to do?
Remind me. What was your vote on confirming Tillerson? You total hack.
no John we think you're crazy
Yea yea they are. And you obviously are ok with this. I listened to your interview on 550 the other day
Yes - watch this for us.  Thanks Senator
Talk is cheap, what are you going to do about this @SenJohnMcCain
Yes. They are crazy.
Gee didn't see this coming. Senator it's time to back up your tough talk with actions. It's been a long wait. Time to walk the walk.
Please stop them. You're one of our only hopes. Americans stand by and can only watch the corruption.
Apparently they are crazy. Thanks for alerting people about this. Makes a mockery of the investigation.
Yes.
What did you think would happen when you voted yes for Tillerson???
This proves SteeleDossier was correct... Has there been anything at all in it at this point that's been disproved? Nope
Well, we haven't seen the pee pee tape, yet...
buttttt it hasn't been disproved yet though & ewwww
I'm sure exists (and my eyes all never recover from seeing it).
Personally  I think it's  probably  worse than a golden shower
Me too which is sad and disgusting.
Very much so
Wow, shocking. Who could've seen this coming?
Maybe they feel like they need to strike while the iron is hot. Like they've succeeded in assembling the necessary cast to make it happen.
Don't act like this isn't on your head, too.
@CathyanneFerree @WSJ @WSJSolomon Yes, begin impeachment.
As you ask this... take a deep, meaningful look in the mirror to realize & embrace that YOU helped create, elevate & promote exactly THIS!
You & your pals in Congress better put a stop to this pronto. Cuz of y'all we need a whole new govt. #TrumpRussia #TheResistance
Senator McCain, PLEASE fight this hard.
Do you need any more reason to investigate this administration and candidate? Add #IvankaTrump for latest trademarks approved by China.
It's clear this family is creating an American oligarchy under your nose & using the highest office to achieve personal wealth/biz goals.
It's also clear from the EOs & # of trips to MaraLago @POTUS #TRUMP doesn't care about the people. #cleanair #cleanwater #NomoreMaraLago
Please stop this blatant crime.
Then do something abt it for pete's sake.
Unfortunate the regs for oil/gas transparency law were repealed by Senate. Now @exxonmobil payments to Russia remain in the dark. #CRA #1504
Tillerson actively lobbied against anticorruption reg saying it would hurt Exxon's biz with Russia. Now we know why it was 1st to go. #1504
Excellent @POLITICOMag article by Michael Grunwald sums it up nicely: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/rex-tillerson-tried-to-get-this-rule-killed-now-congress-is-about-to-do-it-for-him-214725 … @politico
Still unclear who purchased the 19.5% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft, partner in the Exxon deal in question
We knew Tillerson was picked for Putin's Oil & to get around sanctions. They had plenty of time to plan at last weeks press-less meeting.
yep!  i knew something was fishy about that no press thing  more shady bs!
Remember when you voted to approve Tillerson to Sec of State? Were you crazy?
Especially since he saw the damn dossier. He knows what Putin is after...#Rosneft
yes senator they are - and you must do something about it - ASAP 
#STOPtrump #resist #impeach #repealTRUMP
It's all about Big Business Joe we knew this was going to happen and this is just the start. Anything trump does will be for the 5% right on
Then that makes YOU crazy because you voted for Tillerson! What did you think was going to happen voting for "Friend of Russia" as SecState?
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ  John please look into the NRA cleaning Putin's Oligarchs money & sending 100s of Millions o year to the GOP.. The Tax bill is designed to weaken America, Me & my please have read some of it.. looks really bad. it attacks infrastructure, heath insurance,
It's all adding up :
#Flynn’s Turkish lobbying linked to Russia 

#FlynnRussia #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump #TheResistance #RussiaGate
http://politi.co/2q0ZV44 
Medicare, welfare, affordable housing, MILITARY. this is a Putin/Trump. Trumps are colluding with Putin they are collaborating with Putin & China.
Why is our Gov.allowing trump 2blatantly promote his properties at our expense?Conflict of interest no longer applies? Illegal, illegal!!!!!
Is GOP going to let the Oligarchy sell out to Russian Oil via Exxon??
Bet you do zero about it. You talk a lot but never really do anything.
Senator McCain, this could be you: https://youtu.be/aXzjxVYPjys   #TBD #Snl #SNLRepublicanMovie #BeTheHero
Congress needs to move on this mess.  Trump thks he is king and the Rep party is kissing his ass.  Up to you Graham to help us.
So is this when they bribed you @SenJohnMcCain? Did you sell your soul for oil money? McCain no longer upholding the Constitution of the USA
Yes John they are crazy funny thing though they probably get a waiver if Trump has anything to do with it
My circle is guys and gals with IQs of 157 and above.. We don't like what is coming..
All of you dirty politicians are in it for the $$$$..we are not sleep out here!! How low can you go!!
Well do something about it! You've the power to make a difference & you're not using it. You can declare for his taxes.
I'll tell you what McCain. A second chance. No matter what vote no for country or we will label you a traitor.
John great job on nominating Tillerson, now your concerned, please........
Isn't that why @realDonaldTrump is in office? To insure payment all around? #Russia #exxon #goldmansachs
Trump never met Tillerson but yanked him out of thin air for SOS?? Trump/Putin et al are laughing their f@cking rich asses off at us! HATE!.
So, everyone that voted for T. How r those new high paying jobs working out? Cause it sure looks like Wall St. & Big Oil r doin' just fine.
Yes they are and you keep voting with them. So until your voting reflects your outrage we are no longer interested in your thought.
No crazier than the clowns that voted to confirm Tillerson.
You're late to the New Republican Party. Why do you think Tillerson came out of nowhere to get this job?
you were quoted by @washingtonpost
yes
You think they aren't going to get it? You think it wasn't about this all along? If you do then you're  crazy! Do something!
@SenJohnMcCain @MeghanMcCain @JeffFlake You confirmed him! What did you think would happen? You don't get to act surprised by this!
This is as much YOUR FAULT as it is @realDonaldTrump You and the entire corrupt @GOP enabled this Russian collusion. @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ
Beware of big oil. They'll enrich Russia at the expense of the American people.Exxon is on the verge of funding Putin's wars@realDonaldTrump
You don't get to vote to confirm Tillerson and them feign outrage at his previously telegraphed actions. YOU are crazy.
In law enforcement, that's what's called "motive" for Russian interference in Tillerson appointment. #shocked #tillerson #collusion #cahoots
then do something!! #countryoverparty #TrumpRussiaCollusion #trumprussia #IndependentInvestigation #TrumpRussia
You going to do anything formal to oppose this, Senator McCain? Or are you just going to be "troubled" by it?
Bet they get it. With Tillerson and all... Most corrupt Administration ever. Lock him up!
SENATOR MCCAIN, YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.
You must stop this Senator!!!The only reason Tillerson is there is to get this deal back on track. #TrumpRussia #trumpcolluded #Impeachment
Not crazy.  They just see the GOP controlled govt as being corrupt & compromised as does anyone paying attention.
You  fell in line and like the others and bowed to this demagogue who is ruining this great country
Then do something about it! U guys just sit back & let Trump destroy the Republic, make huge amounts of money for his businesses. STOP THEM!
This is your chance @SenJohnMcCain to be the adult in the room and fix this.
Are they crazy? Were u crazy when u voted for him to be #SecState, knowing about his & #Trumps ties to Russia? What did u think would happen
Yes they are, and you're complicit by doing nothing to hold @realDonaldTrump administration accountable
Yes they are crazy and they are CROOKS..  what are you going to do about it McCain?  Geeze! Use your power and get these people locked up!
Come on @SenJohnMcCain. I know, in your heart, you know what is right. I'm counting on you to put country before party. Don't let us down.
I hoped you & @SenLyndseyGraham would stand up to #Trump but you didn't. 100% Trump rating & you haven't mentioned  #Russia
Man! Kind of makes the idea of making him SOS look stupid. Say, how did you vote on his confirmation? Just asking as your constituent.
@neeratanden If the GOP doesn't do its job & get him out, he'll take the country down.
Just another shoe dropping from that Trump/Russia centipede. Please follow this space.
YES! They are crazy! What are you and the rest of Congress doing about it?
This was the sole purpose that Tillerson was hired and all he has energy for.
.Is there any doubt as to what your party actually stands for? Do you really believe they are for #AmericaFirst? wake up& smell the oil!
I would say they are taking off their masks now, but they never put them on in the first place, didn't we know this would happen?
Tillerson-Trump-Putin = Ménage à trois #RussianCollusion
So WTF, John? You are enabling this. You are supporting this. So what does this say about you?
Watch them get it
Whitehouse just said no!!!!
...the ability for American corporations to make MONEY off of Russia!  
Time for the independent commission and special prosecutor!!! If not now then when...after trump provokes war?
lol, you won't do anything about it
Gee, somebody should of warned y'all that the (ex) CEO of Exxon was GOING to do this..and now its dark since all the regs are gone...
Well, you are in more than us sir.   Still think Jim Webb would have been a good choice
WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU???

YOU CONFIRMED CEO SOS!!

YOU OWN THIS
So how about you stand up for Country over Party for once? you vote,
Party over Country every time no matter what you say beforehand
You guys haven't stopped him yet, why start now?
MENTAL ILLNESS HIT ALL!
Crazy~YES.
I see President Obama has more BALLS than all of you so called senators and Puppet 45 he stopped this deal!!!!
In answer to yoke question: yes!  And this is partly your fault. You gave them an inch, now they want hundreds of miles
Boy, if only some members of the Senate had asked actual questions at the confirmation hearing and voted against him....
You can't possibly be surprised
You voted for and supported putin's friend, Tillerson. You put party over country. Why are you surprised? Time to go man... sad.
uhm, you voted to confirm him knowing his past.  #MAGA
I think it is odd that you have to ask the question. Sanity does not abound in this administration or in corporate America.Time to act, Sir.
No, not crazy... just unpatriotic and greedy.
They? Your actions make you a vital member of THEM. What you tell the camera depends on the studio your in. A hero~ POW...tap in & help US.
Senator, you know what's going on & the question is whether you'll do more than tweet abt it. If ever there was a time for country first...
You started all this, Senator.  If you hadn't nominated Sarah Palin, there would be no "President" Trump.
Really Congress? Why did we elect you if not to step up and prevent this shit?
If trump ask you to sign the waiver you'd say yes sir,  drop to your knees and kiss his Russian ass. How does trump ass taste? Respect gone
If you're referring to Exxon, you shouldn't have voted to confirm cabinet members that you knew (and sometimes said) were unsuitable
Not crazy at all. Just ridiculously greedy.
Words are great, but you aren't exactly doing much to stop all this nonsense.
@SenJohnMcCain @SenBlumenthal @SenateMajLdr #tillerson #exxon #russian sanctions lifted for #exxon oil exploration WTF? #SAD!
YES.....

So what are you going to do about it?
If they get this waiver It will be proof Trump and his oligarchs are greedy pigs. Especially with the campaign donations from oil companies.
How much Exxon stock does POTUS own?
Too bad you rubber-stamped every cabinet pick including Tillerson. Similarly crazy things happening in every sector.
Just greedy is all. Unethical and greedy.
But ethics don't apply! And if they do they're only voluntary, as Ivanka might say
Well she would know, right? With her vast experience in politics and government....  oh.
At least the people voted for her they must want her in the administration, right?   Oh.
#iseewhatyoudidthere
You have the majority. You're in Congress. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS KLEPTOCRACY.
There is a half a trillion dollars up for grabs. There is a reason Putin wanted Tillerson and you enabled it! You are all talk & no action!
Why do you think Russia got Trump elected and Putin selected the SOS-both I assume u voted for? When did u stop being a patriot? @votevets
And you will do absolutely nothing about it as usual. Stop with the mock outrage already. No one with half a brain believes you anymore.
 Money does NOT need to rule the world.  Working together to achieve independence FROM oil is what we need.  Not oligarchs.
Interesting...it's the same question many of us ask daily of the entire @GOP congress! Demand his tax returns & discover why!
#taxes
Please stop them Senator.
U voted for REX TILLERSON What did u expect?  @realDonaldTrump & his administration of Oligarchs r out 2 only enrich themselves. WAKEUP!
You voted for him. Are you crazy? Please be brave again and protect us!
Put an end to this madness and DO something instead of tweeting about it! Thanks!
No Senator, this was the plan all along, it's why Tillerson was nominated and why all top State Dept officials were fired, was obvious then-
- super duper obvious now
No, they just figure you'll roll over and vote yes under protest.
Yes Senator, they are crazy, because they know they will get it with the crazies currently in the WH. Ur party has gone off the deep end.
What did u expect when u voted for him to be Sec of state?  Seriously...not rocket science, it's $500 BILLION
Not crazy. Corrupt. Please, please move your fellow Republicans to action B4 all American decency is lost. Perhaps before America is lost.
Senator, maybe you shouldn't have blindly followed your party when you voted to confirm a completely inappropriate person for Sec of State.
If (when) they get waiver McCain will do nothing.
Too bad you have no spine and won't do anything to stop this.  #GrowAPair #ShameOnYou #Resist #ImpeachTrump
Senator McCain thanks for not backing down.  To Donald Chump, you have surrounded yourself with people about as bad (bad guys) as upi
Yeah their crazy, they'll sell their first born to make a dollar, shit... The country doesn't mean anything to these traitors. #Democrats
What did you think was going to happen when you voted to confirm Tillerson, @SenJohnMcCain? You bought it, you own it.
We has been asking  you to be the Hero this country needs. Do something.
You'll vote for it anyway. Stop pretending
Quid pro quo, they want payback for the election
Do something, please! Put your country before your party.
then do something  @SenJohnMcCain , forgot GOP in office, control all , everything is fine
Are you just getting this?
No.  You are crazy, to let it happen.
It's why Vlad is our boyfriend.
Not crazy, just Machiavellian. #climatechange
202-225-5021 - #HouseForeignRelationsCommittee  call and tell them the #Swamp stinks!
Didn't you vote for him? Shame on you, @SenJohnMcCain.
Where's our investigation?
Seriously, Senator?  #Capitalists focus on money, not country or religion or ethics.  These #Republicans are doing just that.  To hell w/USA
We are under a covert attack. You of all people know that, right?
Then do something about it! You are all talk
King Donald the first and his royal family now rule America!
Yes, John, that’s the man you voted to confirm whose dealings you knew all about. Remember?
Oh please you feign offense. In the end you will vote for it like u always do. You said DeVos was the most unqualified and then u voted yes.
