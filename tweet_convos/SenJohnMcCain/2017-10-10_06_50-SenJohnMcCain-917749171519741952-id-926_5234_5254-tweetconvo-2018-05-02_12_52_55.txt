Goodbye Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska. The Jones Act is unsustainable for them..
Whaddya say Canada  let’s adopt these orphans! #PuertoRico
PLEASE
Americans coming to Canada , to flee the tyranny of Komrade Trump, should be seen as refuges. #justsayin
And I'm Puerto Rican.. he is killing us NO WATER
It’s private enterprise & the good will of neighbours to try & rebuild. It seems thro tweets from @CarmenYulinCruz there’s little govt aid
The diaspora is helping,many ppl are donating. Obama had 40k troops in Haiti after earthquake and aid there w/in 4 days
What is congress going to do about this?
Indeed.  I wish they would start naming names of the Congress members who are slowing things down or outright voting against aid.
There's in house fighting & they'll never be united because of their egos.
It's just very frustrating to see Senators come on here and whine about 45.  Until Mueller acts, THEY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP @GOP
True! It’s like .@tedlieu. I like him, but he keeps asking US to fix it. I am hoarse from making calls. Should I come to vote in Congress?
Congress is silent because they don't want to be fixed.
There must be a veritable shitload of dirt on many of them for there to be zero resistance to trump.
But, the way these Republicans are acting, they seem to be dirtier
This is absurd! A country that is suppose to have compassion for others and support the weak has turned into tyranny and chaos by our gov!
and all this is going on- Bannon, Mercers, cruz hit #replay2016  to replace all GOP with BANGOP & 45s’ white nationalist agenda!  #Impeach45
I am not the least bit concerned about crazy alcoholic Steve Bannon and his felon candidates. The @TheDemocrats must take back the seats.
Your exactly right! 2018 must change for the better and not stay the way it is. The turtle, Ryan, Graham, all of the supposed GOP must go!
Only, if Dems take over the Senate & house 2018 & 2020 incl these special elections!
Well please do something about it then!!
That is not american
Senator, what has happened to the GOP? Where's the decency? Dignity? Gravitas? Basic competence? Work ethic? Integrity?...
Letting waiver of Jones Act expire shows DJT does NOT care about PR. Those poor people. 3 wks in, still barest of minimum of help. PLEASE
Waiver of Jones Act still expired. If you don't know who president of VI &PR is, easy to leave twisting in the wind. Congress, HELP THEM.
DT threatening to remove aid from PR. Citizens dying from contaminated water. You need to stop him from this genocide
@FEMA_Brock @fema DO SOMETHING!
That fema guy is just another trump patsy, looking for daddy trump’s approval for his cutting remarks against a Puerto Rican female mayor
"Good job, Brocky."
CRIMINAL DISCRIMINATION
If only you had some kind of position of power that would enable you to do something more than retweet @HuffPost
exactly what is the Jones act good for? Americans have to pay double shipping because? tell me it does something important at least? Right
@workclassjane @HuffPost @jbendery  Why isn't your party  doing something. These are Americans
At least one Republican in congress has some sense...
Why can't you fix?
Love you John but tell your buddies to FIX IT and stop hiding from your voters cause Trump will talk bad about them
And this is making America better?  Last time I looked, PR is part of America. What am I missing?
I don't recognize my country anymore.
A Senator wields no power to help??!!
Not when standing alone.
And what are YOU doing to help them, Sen. McCain?
He looks like the crypt keeper
He is unfit to be POTUS. It is time for the GOP to step up and act like they care.

 ...#Trump #TrumpsKatrina

          #PuertoRicansAreAmericans 

…
Thank you for your years of service to our country. Thank you for looking out for our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. God bless you
And Trump doesn't give a damn, nor do, seemingly, most republicans.
Please keep the Pressure on to roll back JONES ACT!!!
Where's the "president" in all of this?
It's their choice to be an American territory. Don't hurt American shipping jobs for the sake of Puerto Rico.
It was never our choice you ignorant, don't  you read and know HISTORY!!  We are Americans as well we have the same effing rights you do
If enough Puerto Ricans want independence it would happen. U haven't signed the Constitution. Don't see the US sending in troops to stop it.
They want STATEHOOD, guy. They want to continue to be part of the US but with all the rights AND responsibilities the rest of us have.
History repeats itself: San Ciriaco 1899. https://www.facebook.com/diasporaresiste/posts/157790004809134?pnref=story …
Oh my God those poor people!!

Awesome... you mean you can't steal my money and give it to them as a subsidy? Finally, we are getting back to fair and moral.
Unfair!
No people extend it!!!
if people died in #PuertoRico because of this, or children died because #CHIP expired, that is legally called negligent homicide

Perhaps Congress can bill @realDonaldTrump for the difference 
#PuertoRicoRelief is a farce and @POTUS is mentally out of touch with reality
That JonesAct should be thrown out. It's old and totally outdated and should be thrown out. Pray for PR. Those people are dying daily.So sad
Please help out the PR people @SenJohnMcCain! This is inhumane and unamerican!
Shocking...nothing like hitting them when they're down...God Bless those poor souls in PR
Bring it back up! We want them to get help!!!
Thus is so wrong
This   is INSANE please call WH #JonesAct #PuertoRico
Check out the lefty loons on this joker's  twitter feed! He is nothing but a RINO! TIME TO GO!
Do something RINO! RETIRE!
THEY ARE AMERICANS FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE
So After The Nuclear WAR. ...No one Is Coming America. ...Republicans Don't Care About Their Fellow Americans only Rich People
How can a Patriot of your stature allow the disgrace that 45 is inflicting on this country @SenJohnMcCain?
Interesting pic advocating aid to PR. Any pics of starving children to motivate response?
In all your years of politics could you have ever imagined that a President would behave so divisively as Trump has?
If only there was something you could do...if only you were in the Senate or something.....
@bellablue01 @HuffPost @jbendery JUST WHAT   "liddle trump" "liddle moron" "liddle madman" WANTS! HURTASMANY PEOPLEASPOSSIBLE
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! These ppl are dying!
DO SOMETHING! These Americans must be helped! This congress and admin will have blood on their hands of you do not act now
but that's the gop's favorite american way: fuck over the poor, the weak and vulnerable... besides - it's only brown people anyway - right?
That’s pretty damn cruel !
This is ridiculous
@SenSanders @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @marcorubio @tedcruz can you help us? 
It is a disgrace to treat American Citizens in this manner. This man is despicable.
Shame on USA!  Greed before humanity.
Shut up half brain RINO McCain
WTF people
Despicable, deplorable, inhumane and animalistic! 1/20/17=dictatorship. @CarmenYulinCruz make a plea to Canada to align. Run for the border!
McCain and the HuffPost just wants to give these good paying jobs to non-American. Remember Puerto Ricans are Americans.
Allot of Puerto Rican working on those ships. Keep American employed. Yes to Jones Act!!! I’m always 100% against anything McCain says.
I’m a Puerto Rican for the Jones Act. It keeps our shore safe and we don’t need foreign ships transportings good between states.
So they are further being punished as a result of the hurricane ! That’s the gop American way! Profit before people
~ Trump is in "Grievous Violation" .........                                                Please Read: http://tl.gd/n_1sq888t 
@SenJohnMcCain you have the power. You will have the votes. Bring this to the senate floor before more people die
Do something!
Senator,   Please SAVE US from the MADNESS!!!
Trump calls them Spics. He'll never help them. Why can't we do anything about this horrible Bigot?
This is just WRONG. I don't understand it. 
That's fucked up
Please, @SenJohnMcCain. Those of us w/ loved ones in PR are begging for more help!!
Please do something about this president. Rally your fellow R's. It's not worth democracy and American lives to support this monster
Trump is Heartless, a scrooge without a Xmas ghost to set him straight.  God help the Tiny Tims in America.
This is on believable!!
Trump is now punishing PR!
That's so wrong. Trump doesn't care about POC.
That's insane
The a dam crying shame , so USA rich shipping companies make mega profits the is a old WWII law that make rich richer  and kills PR @AC360
Wonder if your friend @LindseyGrahamSC brought this up while golfing with Trump.
Then do something about the economic rape of American citizens
This is the real tragedy! Slow suffering under dumpy trumpy 
Can you and your GOP majority led congress and senate do something?
But it's an Island...Surrounded by Water. Big Water, Ocean Water. .https://youtu.be/iVzey3LReUU 
#25thAmendmentNow
They need it reinstated fast. Thank you for your years of service Senator McCain. I pray you get well & can take some time to relax.
Hey John, isn’t it your job to make sure Americans get what they need in a time of CRISIS? Stop tweeting & do your job. What up w/Congress?
None of this makes any sense. Am I to understand disaster victims must pay to receive humanitarian aid?
Sad 
Sad. This president (small p) simply doesn't care.
Deliberate genocide of the PR people. Congress trying to force mass exodus or deaths so that they can annihilate our race. @Lin_Manuel
Are u F#%^G kidding me? That's politically incorrect TrumpThe Chump! HELP THESE PPL
Trump's blindness on this glaring issue is going to end up costing the taxpayers unnecessary millions to assist Puerto Rico in rebuilding
This is trump getting revenge on a smart strong woman who dared to SPH up to him - trump couldn't care less about the policy issues involved
That is idiotic, oh I forgot, that is congress who can fix this.  Silly me
Our country is in chaos. PLEASE DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR POSITION AND INFLUENCE TO HELP
So, what happens when foreign registry shippers ignore this law & send products to PR? Will the USCG in PR step in? Asking for a friend.
Heartless!
WTF!
#onewordreplies
Senator, this is so http://Wrong.How  can you Possibly ALLOW Trump to treat the people of Puerto Rico this way? It's Inhumane.They were Hit with 2 back to back Major Hurricanes.Wake the F*!K Up.
What can we do?Just cause brown, they don't deserve same help as TX & FL? @realDonaldTrump You are ruining this country. #ImpeachTrumpNow
So much for “United” States
Please, Senator, PLEASE, do something to stop this madness.  We as a nation are swirling around a dark abyss and it gets worse everyday.
thank you sir for speaking out about this. We appreciate you and your service
Puerto Rico will become independent as soon as it recovers enough to hold a referendum. There is clearly no reason to remain American.
Glad to see you step up for #PuertoRico don't forget to do something for the 8.9 mil children in #CHIP
Thanks, John. You are right on!
45 people now confirmed dead. Diseased water spreading throughout. This is a humanitarian crisis. Congress Must ACT!

The Jones Act requires the US & its territories to use US flagged vessels.Meaning ships crewed with American Merchant Mariners.American Jobs
Dear Sen.McCain, 
Please act to remove the menace(s) in our WH. 
Our children are watching. 
Sincerely,
America
#ImpeachMoronTrump
Hilary would have been a better president. Do you agree now?
Do something! You can. Congress can. #puertorico #actnow #newwaiverforJonesAct
How much longer are you willing to let this go on?
So far @SenJohnMcCain is only legislator in DC who even seems aware and concerned. Thank you Senator
But he needs to do better. The longer Trump stays in office, the graver the consequences to the country.
Zero argument. DT must go. @SenJohnMcCain is a frontline soldier in this battle and on our side despite his GOP affiliation.
I sure hope so.
Please continue to speak out. PR does not need more of a burden they already http://have.Help  them
Trump is to busy fighting eith his own party and NFL.
Treatment of Americans in Puerto Rico is not just appalling.  It's criminal.  https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FDonnaNoble10th%2Fstatus%2F917930127039836160&h=ATMUICJpQI0OoV4beLDUMN3ztpbiyakH9Vazu2RjK5_v766ZgIo_uKwv3-DuvnXJ1B-bpLFIby6K0db7XTChxKkMk1BwAdPCWRJQRNvVlvzhUtvisBKPDcpJGhamZgtwGDwcSPV3vcm4_qELjZ1v_qFTiHdf9zC9JZ9rWAlcdsVsJWTwE4DrS4dASIbXo8KS1uh2N7fqEIjxMVuO_Xz6DZz-WfVakvzlFDus1mTNQdlQAqfdoZEptGBzcvoNAaqX9vwc6nzOr_UJ6CWqqUoWa9jZqmPyLT4l848 …
The poser in chief is a racist Nazi. @realDonaldTrump #notpresidential
Sadly your party not just Trump hates Hispanic's. Hates them.Cant stand them in our country.
Senator McCain - We NEED YOU. 
DON'T STOP resisting our incompetent, vulgar, deplorable POTUS. 
GOP must #ImpeachTrumpNow
DO SOMETHING Congress !!
People are dying 
Over 30% still without safe drinking water - it’s been 3 weeks
Trump is #Unfit
#NationAtRisk
Great work Republicans!!! Once again you all show your bigotry against Latins.#shameshame #Republincansshame
Hey but #maga, eh? Y’all (@gop) supporter this incompetent man, u rip what u sow.
Sen. McCain this man has harassed you ad nauseum and his Puert Rico policies are nothing short of genocide. START IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS!!!
What is wrong with your party? #BoughtAndPaidFor
not true. 1) the waiver was not used- we had enough American businesses to transport cargo 2) there is no evidence JA means higher prices
One thing we DO know is that the Virgin Islands, which are exempt from the JA, pay around 40% more for goods than PR. McCain=misinformation
Your bunny in mid-battlecry, is straight up ferocious!
Thanks! There's a lot to battle these days.
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
@HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
Your party has abandoned your country to an oligarch and an intellectual ogre. If the GOP won't stop him who will?
Didn't the deadline for Russian sanctions expire as well? What is Congress doing on this?
Your party is a failure
Revolution's have started for less. Time for Puerto Rico to say "adios" to their colonial oppressors.
Well, that was quick
This might be a good time to repeal the Jones act, if it is such an impediment.
Thanks for pointing this out. It was a rotten, but typical, move by #DonaldTheBitch. #statehood4pr
Perfect example of the Christian-Right.  What are their new MORALS.?
Sir,
Time to step up
Please Save your Republic and it's Constitution 
Please 25ththe45th
Lift it please!
@realDonaldTrump =GENOCIDE OF AMERICANS in PR! Trump gets a "F" for leadership & execution.  @thehill @HuffPost @SenWarren @CBSNews @VP
Um. That's BS.
Trump governs as a racist/bigot against minorities/blue states. Tragedy struck PR(hurricanes)/CA(fires) and he gives minimum help to recover
Trump has to go
Trump is no leader. These are citizens! Theyre starving, sick,and dieing! Get help there, and hold him accountable!
This should be the headline, not whether HRC should criticize Weinstein.
Well, if only one of us were in a position of power to do something about this . Oh, wait. . .

Stop twitting abt this & do something now!
Lil Butt Hurt #JohnMcCain... The Gift That Just Keeps On Giving.
a jonesAct they keep, but no gun control - the true face of white capitalism.
He needs to be Impeached NOW! He will end America if he is not gone soon. He is a shameful pitiful little minded man.
where are the pirates who give fck about the jonesAct - this colonialism and pure white supremacy fascism.
So come on John.  You and Corker should be able to rustle up enough support to impeach this Faux-TUS.
Somehow, it's even worse...
But that take is borne out by fact that 800 staff on Comfort are treating just 7 patients while Puerto Ricans die in faltering hospitals. 6/ 
He'll get right on it after he's done golfing
What a shame 
And the President's reaction is to ask for a f***ing loan for PR.
& the moron in charge don’t realize these people r dying. They need help but that man doesn’t care. Thank you senator for sharing this.
Because no one wants your input or help Johnboy
So unfair. Bring private sector help in asap! #RESIST
The president can grant waivers, but you could repeal the Jones Act.
What is holding you up on that?
Traitor McCain I See Your At It Again! 
Didn't Learn From Vietnam!Tsk!Tsk!
You Changed Party To Run For Pres.&
Stayed To Be A Traitor.Sick!!
Where might I find more info about Jones Act costs and impact?
Then pass a bill Senator. Checks and balances.
@senategop should do something about this!
What is wrong with our country - why can't we take care of our own? This is ridiculous!
ALL @SenateGOP need to muster up the courage to speak out! Shut down the #AdultDayCare. Trump is #UnfitToLead. #TrumpIsAMoron
Do something. Please.
This needs to STOP and STOP NOW
Wouldn't it be great if there were leaders, say in the President's party who could do something about this travesty?
This is insane. We need to help these people.
Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for standing up for what is right.  God bless you
Please help #PuertoRico. Push for a #JonesAct waiver in the #Senate.
They had 3 votes to become a state and they refused.  They are $118 billion in debt and want a handout.  Sorry, time to pay up.
So do something about this!!  What is wrong with you people?  You have power, Use IT!!!  American people are dying!
Ridiculous  what is congress going to do about it
Please extend the waiver until the island recovers.  They’re  still in ruins!
But remember, all their debt and infrastructure issues are their fault. Talk about having the deck stacked against you...
@ananavarro @CNN @donlemon @andersoncooper @DanRather  Hey @GOP do your job and reinstate the waiver immediately !!!!
@SenJohnMcCain why is the US Virgin Islands exempt and not Puerto Rico?
Please DO something about the #JonesAct waiver instead of just writing about it!  SHAME on the @GOP & Trump RE: the welfare of #PuertoRico
We should do a Dunkirk and move 300,000 Puerto Rican’s to Florida. Private boats!
Thousands on the island are on the brink of starvation. Congress needs to step up to the plate NOW!
Too bad you're completely powerless to do anything about it, @SenJohnMcCain Action now! #SavePuertoRico
Remove a president who is trying to kill Americans. They are AMERICANS, but this president doesn't think so!
Congress must act. People in Puerto Rico are starving. FEMA is failing it’s mandate - watch Maddow & read their mandate again.
Wasn’t even on hold long enough to allow for shipping time.
Sir, with & Respect, please DO SOMETHING about this moronic lunitic TRAITOR!
