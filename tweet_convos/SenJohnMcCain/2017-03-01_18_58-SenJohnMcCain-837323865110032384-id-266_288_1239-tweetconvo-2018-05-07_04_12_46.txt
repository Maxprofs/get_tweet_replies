Who let this child abducter out of his hole . I pray the Putin puts him back there.
Why do U keep repeating the same nonsense w/ host Dana "Gash" & the Geritol wonder boys? The Depends discussion is long over.
You should try working with the Republicans. From where I stand, you are fighting against the administration.
Yes!  But I have grave doubts that will ever happen!
You know it's rich that you guys are astonished Dems don't want to work with you when you refused to work with President Obama.
Visa versa... Obama was not known to be the great compromiser
I see you never go to @FoxNews. Only your #FakenewsCNN buddies. SHAME ON YOU!   #MAGA
@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS  Not with Trump. He's rude, incompetent and not fit to be president of US. He needs to go... with his pawns
it is time to stop this insane behavior and start working together!
and @SenJohnMcCain need to move on down the road #TermLimits
@SenJohnMcCain Yes. So why don't you do it?
@SenJohnMcCain yes we wanted the Rep to wk with the Dems during Obama yrs too! The Rep should proffer the olive branch...
the DEms makeep America look stupid
damn I wish that old bastard would retire and same gramhamsty
yes they do, but where was that question and respect when Obama was president!?
@SenJohnMcCain No one is buying your b.s. You are only working against the President. It's shameful.
So why do you keep fighting the President? U R constantly under minding him.
Yeah, and sometimes the Dems agreed with him and stabbed him in the back and reneged on their promises. Cannot trust.
@SenJohnMcCain - Traitor John the RINO.
Yes. Why don't you try working with the Trump Administration?
where what's this "work together " attitude the last 8 years ?
Yeah let's work with the DNC otherwise called as follows:
-Liars
-Hypocrites
-Manipulators
-Communists
-Deceivers
-Lunatics
I think most of the American people would like for John McCain and Lindsey Graham to go off into the sunset
@SenJohnMcCain You Are A Strong Senator please bring the Country back 
@SenJohnMcCain Get it done this Country is so divided make it Great again 
and what happened during the previous 8 years ?  You all were not the best of examples !!  Yes, we want you together
The Republicans gangs and the Democrats gangs need to stop feuding. The only thing they are doing is shooting each other.
I want u 2 explain why its ok 4 u 2 ask the Russians 4 campaign donations 4 ur election but it's not ok 4 POTUS 2 just speak to them
@SenJohnMcCain YES. Feel like treating GOP and Dems like sibs who fight; handcuff them together until they can cooperate
@SenJohnMcCain Then why did we have 8 years of GOP stonewalling?  Tell the whole truth...
@SenJohnMcCain. Only in a government that truly represents and protects ALL CITIZENS EQUALLY!!!
Work together to investigate Russian influence on elections and remove the pretender from the Oval Office.
we should be working together to resolve likely russian collusion to influence presidential election and Trump's complicity
They aren't working with Dems...They are voting party lines repealing regs that protect workers, environment and public
& McCain would help by not pushing your NWO agenda for depopulation via WW3. See GeorgiaGuideStonesRussia are not the enemy YOU are !
@SenJohnMcCain Neither Reagan nor the dems were Russian agents.
Yes I for one would like for U to stop being a traitor to this nation and people. Stop bad mouthing, be part of solution
ALTHOUGH DEMS & REP ARE ALWAY POLARIZED - THERE ARE THINGS YOU SHOULD GET DONE TOGETHER - IT IS GOOD TO WORK TOGETHER
@SenJohnMcCain 
Now Jeff Sessions lied under oath, I'm thinking your all liars.
@SenJohnMcCain.    We do want you all to work together.  And we want Trump and his den of thieves out of our govt. They have no honor
you are incapable of that!! Why do you think TRUMP was elected....Pull the drain plug
Difference is...Sen. McCain is NO REAGAN Conservative...he IS a man working hard to undermine the Trump Administration...
.@CNN @SenJohnMcCain Trying to reverse Trump's #JoinSession momentum?
Epic fail. 
#Sessions is going to take down your corrupt #DeepState
I agree, you all should work together for the common good of all
ya but they used every ounce of energy they had to not work with Obama!
@SenJohnMcCain whenever I hear Reagan- my mind goes to
Iran Hostages, weapons, Contras and a whole bunch of I can't remembers
notmyhero
@SenJohnMcCain he speaks with forked tongue
Depends on what you're working on. Work together on policies to help folks? Sure. Fall in line behind bigotry? No chance
I would be reluctant to believe anything any republican says at this point as, members of congress have been harboring their fuehrer.
@SenJohnMcCain @tempteststorm2 Pres T said  in his speech. Why r u in lock step CNN. Respect ur service but not you anymore. Follow 
@SenJohnMcCain Working together starts with you being N ambassador to your party, not an antagonist. 894/899
To McCain: Yes we wanted you to work together for the past 8 years.
@SenJohnMcCain yes we do! It's all upto the decent folks on both sides of the aisle to accomplish that! Like you Mr. McCain!
@SenJohnMcCain Work together when reasonable, but stand w/integrity vs. lies, corruption, & abuse of power. The world is watching.
@SenJohnMcCain why are you saying this now? Why did Republicans NOT work with Obama. Shut down his SC nomination for 10 months!
@SenJohnMcCain Try working with @POTUS . You are not giving @realDonaldTrump a chance. Perhaps a bit of envy on the part of a loser?
like how they worked together so well during the previous administration. Do tell me a story.
time for a visit for him to mental ward! dems want to break this country not improve it. Obstructionist only! their DNA!
@SenJohnMcCain Please work with and support President Trump
@SenJohnMcCain I am an AZ voter. I realize that you spoke against some of Trump's nominees. Am disappointed that you always voted party
@SenJohnMcCain Yes. I'd love to see two opposing centrists run together next race. #blasphemy
Why couldn't you make this assertion 4 years ago?  3 years ago?  2 years ago? Timing is everything.  @twwnaz
@SenJohnMcCain YES WORK TOGETHER JOHN STOP WITH THE STUPID RUSSIAN BS YOU SHOULD HAVE DEFENDED FLYNN AND TRUMP GET IN LINE!
@SenJohnMcCain Absolutely!  The same cooperation Republicans demonstrated the past 8 years.  What hypocritical nonsense.
@SenJohnMcCain your party should have thought about that for the last 8 years
Неплохо, говорите по-русски.
@SenJohnMcCain American people wanted GOP and DEMs to work together last 8 years. GOP couldn't do it. Don't blame DEMs for division.
@SenJohnMcCain It depends.  Work together for dismantling of our administrative agencies? NO.  HELL NO.
@SenJohnMcCain Don't agree with all his ideas, but nevertheless,I love the guy!Sir,I would buy an used car from you, w/my eyes closed!
@SenJohnMcCain Yeah, we wanted the Republicans to work with Obama for 8 yrs, too! All we saw was stubborn obstruction.
oh boy, Mr McCain. You sure lead the battle to "work together" for 8 years, didn't you?  NOT!   #hypocrite
Am I the only one who noticed Graham shaking his head no when asked if #45 would work with democrats? Started yes then went to no.
@SenJohnMcCain Biggest threat to our democracy is rabid partisanship
no kidding? Lol haha
McCain is a tool of the media. He needs to retire.
@SenJohnMcCain too bad this was not the attitude for the last 8 years #thanksobama
Problem is, Reps refused to work w/ Obama for 8 years. Now you all look like hypocrites.
@SenJohnMcCain 
With you until now, no working with 45 & administration, nominees. His agenda is non-negotiable & nefarious.StandStrong
@SenJohnMcCain  the American people want that almost as much as we want McCain to retire and zip his Yap.
Not anymore..elected Republicans have proved to be traitors to the American people #trumprussia
@SenJohnMcCain Yea we thought that the last eight years...where were you and every other Republican??
@SenJohnMcCain 

Country before party! But let's not look away from Russian ties.... let's clean that up quick.
@SenJohnMcCain , Reagan days are over!!!
republicans NEVER worked with Obama, did all they could to bring him down.  KARMA.
no
Yes, we do, Sir.
fuck no !
Senator, I hope you realize the President feels no obligation to do that.He won with a loud minority.He will govern to please the same.
@CNNPolitics @FoxNews you must work together, you are being paid for that, and you must be effective,efficient to materialize citizrder
Would have loved it the past 8 years. But instead GOP led an  obstructionist Legislature.  Why the surprise we don't want trust you?
.@CNN @CNNPolitics @SenJohnMcCain stop pretending 45/GOP wants to work with or care about anyone. #traitorsall #climatedeniers #bullies
bipartisan usually means a larger-than-usual deception is being carried out. ~GC
What is your point? Reagan worked as circumstances in his times. Trump will work as current circumstances require for.
yes, Sen. McCain, we do. We've wanted it for at least 8 years. Why do you call for it only now?
McCain takes the blue pill twice a day. If he had a store tag it would read: 
Jackass Clothing Co. 
designed by G. Soros
Made in China
when obama was pres, none of you rep were willing to work with him or the dems
it is obvious that there is no togetherness in Congress
SESSION DID NOTHING WRONG, KEEP FISHING, BRAIN WILLIAMS REPORTING THE TRUTH? READ SESSION STATEMENT ENOUGH SAID. DEMS LOST AGAIN
THE DEMS DON'T WORK WELL WITH OTHERS, CAN YOU SAY DINGY REED, MOONBAT PELOSI,SHIFTY SHUMMER,GOOFY WARREN,. THEY STARTED IT.
wierd that this is being said after he fought tooth and nail against Obama, did he forget the bill he co-created and voted against.
@SenJohnMcCain you fail to mention Obama counting on you all to work together like grown ups &your gang all SUCKED at it.#notjustreagan
yes we want you to work together PLEASE
Senator mccain a real war hero !!!!
@79topper Not with Trump in office.  Impeach him and we will all sing kumbaya
yes we do
@JohnMcCain With all due respect Senator (and as a Dem I have far more for you than most of my Rep equivalents would for a Democratic..
..Senator), where was this ethos that you are now promoting when a truly intelligent & positive leader held the Presidency?
I think you should have thought about that 8 years ago. Right now you can kiss my ***
There's no compromise with the Dems, it's a waste of time to even try.
TERM LIMITS!!!!!
Absolutely, Sen. McCain!
d That's why the Democrats are in the position their in. Completely out of touch and don't give a crap. It's a slow death to them.
both of you #McCain and #Graham need to be honest your Really Democrats but as Turn Coats against #Trump Don't expect PRIVILEGE
Dismantle the Federal Gov.& keep only the defense department.All other bureaucratical functions can be handled on the state level.
Sen McCain correct in respect POTUS Trump asked for all political factions to work together - but Dems mantra is "resist"- must change.
yes and for 8 years you refused to work with Obama.
@SenJohnMcCain why yes, yes, we do want you to work together but if the @GOP cont to blind eye 45.  Then, no, can't happen. #lostGOP
@SenJohnMcCain we do . BTW so did @POTUS44 Pres @billclinton and @SenateDems
you should not have any saying, lost all respect for you
American people wants a healthcare insurance like the one we pay to McCain. Not more, not less.
yes we wanted you to work with Obama too. Funny how that didn't take place but it's expected now
hmmm...politicians working together for us? Wow! What a novel idea #votethemallout #youworkforus #compromise #MAGA #Trump
Is Dana wearing white for the same reason the Dem women wore white last night?
@johnmccain2016 Yes! Just like we waited 8 long years for the Repubs to work with Obama. Now you expect compromise? Jerks!
Not if giving in means not supporting President Trump!
your job requires you to work together for the betterment of the country!  Not for the benefit of a party or a state or to keep a job!
uh yes
so why haven't you ever before worked for the American people?
GOP refused work w/Democrats & especially Pres. Obama but now Demos are supposed to work with Trump. What would Joe Biden's response be
yes "We do people do"
Right, like the way the GOP so willing to work with Obama.
#songbirdmccain
so how is calling someone a fascist solving anything...how great could America be if we would come together?
You damn right we do. Do something congress
....lil hint #CNN....not a single person with a brain CARES what McCain OR Graham say/think.
@SenJohnMcCain like the Reps sought to work with the other side the last 8 yrs???
Funny how the GOP didn't give the same consideration to President Obama for the 8 years the majority of voters  voted for him
@SenJohnMcCain, we have no problem w/you working together when you're working FOR us instead of 100% against us! #RepairNotReplace!
yes we want them to work together but the Democrats won't do it they're the ones that are going to be in trouble come next voting
maybe that would work if we did not have a fascist in the WH
Please stop calling Obama a fascist. He's out of office now.
- McCain lost to Obama in 2008.  Why is what he thinks important?
the hypcrisy here is astounding. He says that after 8 years of NO!!! To anything Obama
Please just go away
who is the anchor..She even don't know how to question to a person ... Biased media..
We are not really into working with the Russians right now.
when the dems boo and hiss at his joint speech & dont have decency to stand and applaude they don't want to work with him
Reagan was a plastic paddy please don't insult Irish people by saying Reagan was Irish .him and thatcher prolonged the situation in NI
why wouldn't the GOP work with Obama?
you go Senator McCain! You embody American Sacrifice in Conflict! You should have been our President in '08! #johnmccain #CNNTownHall
It is clear that Trump has shown that he can only work with the Russians. Look at his history.
@SenJohnMcCain oh  but U did that which is why we're here.
Yes that would be great if both would work together the reps would not work with Obama for 8 years Did nothing still want work with dem
GOP didn't work with President Obama
No
Stop with the speeches, egos & all the pretty words & do your jobs! I'm tired of hearing the bs! Get together & work it out! Geez!!
@SenJohnMcCain @mccathe American people wants answers. #RUSSIA who are involved .  The list is growing.
Where was this desire to work together when Obama was president?
@TomArnold no @SenJohnMcCain not if you're out to destroy US followTrump/Bannon plan. Prefer not destroy environment, ACA or Education
while blaming obama,McCain has forgotten that the GOP under the direction of Paul manafort added the defunding of Ukraine in platform
love to see senators that show morality over party. #CNNTownHall
Since they are covering up this Russia thing, most likely we don't want them working together. Might have been relevant in 8y obstruct.
the only idea the GOP brings to the table is "...no..."  Look at the ACA, 6 fucking years & they don't have a replacement plan! WTF!?
Why didn't the GOP work with President Obama?
Because their guys (McCain/Romney) lost to Obama twice.
