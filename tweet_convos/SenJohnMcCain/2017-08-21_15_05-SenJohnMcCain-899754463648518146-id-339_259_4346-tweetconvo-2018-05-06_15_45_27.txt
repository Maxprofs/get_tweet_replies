You hide behind an anonymous name like a coward too
Keep hiding behind an anonymous identity posting lies about Senator McCain. Did you also graduate from tier 1 undergrad & law school?
"Dude" ; that says it all.   Lol.
Why did you scream repeal Obamacare and the turn your back on your constituents
He is two faced
You're right!
Burma is awesome.
Go straight to hell, Grady.
thats a very sweet video of ur Burma,#prayers are with u ur taking care of yourself
Why did you vote No on healthcare?
To help those who couldn't get healthcare without the ACA.
Excuse me, but there IS coverage for those in bill. U choose not see it.I assure u if u were in my situation you'd feel VERY different
My family member went bankrupt b/c of pre-e siting condition before ACA. Could not get insurance. Now has it, like 30 mil others.
I've never been your biggest supporter but it's time you enjoy life to the fullest. Be happy and thanks for your vote against ending ACA.
Awesome!
Sad thing to say but it's true
Cute dog. Helps for a speedy recovery.
Chessie?
Good dog!!
God bless you! 
What a beautiful and lucky girl she is to be part of your family, Senator. <3 <3
Love the name!
Chesapeake Bay Retriever? Repeal Obamacare WTF
she is gorgeous thanks for sharing sooo cute! Amazing how much love a dog has we can all learn something from our dogs! #TWDResists
Obama n Trump care focus on their supporters. Need neutral health care system.
We need a unified Rep, party. Please entire
We can learn a lot about enjoying life from dogs and children!
Be well Mr. McCain!
The love and companionship of a dog (or even 3 dogs ) brings us joy and hope in our darkest moments! Burma is gorgeous! 
Thank you, Sen. McCain, for taking the high road in every decision made for our country. Well-done. Get well soon. The country needs you!
Is she a Chesapeake Bay retriever? They're high energy and require a strong master. 
She's wonderful!
Hope you are doing good, God be with you
You need to retire and keep playing with your dog you are not much good as a Republican
Burma does for that stick what John McCain would do for our country: go get it and bring it back!  Love you Senator McCain.
Yeah, right. He had the opportunity, and he failed.
Just curious. Why are you following him. if you don't mind my asking?
I wasn't until last week. I'm just curious as to how many people disrespect him after what he did.
I'm guessing you mean the thumbs down vote? If you think he did it out of spite, sure. But what if he did it out of sense of responsibility?
Meanwhile, Trump is destroying this country
Thank you John McCain. God bless you
Chessies rule! Beautiful dog. Glad to see you enjoying life's little pleasures.
Good girl Burma! Java and Clipper send their best.
That is one happy and lucky dog!!! <3

We had a lab for years. Couldn't keep him out of the water. 
Please retire.

No better comfort than a furry best friend when you're ill.  Peace & prayers to you, Sen. McCain.
Nothing like a good water dog.  Now clean heruo 
Nothing like a good dog to cure all your ills!
Good girl! 
My dog Murphy also loves the water and will jump in for whatever goes in...including frogs who are just trying to get out of his way...
You are both the best America has
U'v been in D.C. To long!  Our expectations were immediate repeal & replace.  U touted a plan in place and waiting for the chance. Well?
when we respond to your tweets with Facts that make you look bad . You push out useless tweets of rainbows and  nature to bury our comments
How nice for you.  Doesn't matter we are suffering with bad healthcare as long as your happy. Too bad CNN is not around for u to run to.
You should retire and spend more time with her.
Good boy
Beautiful!!!
And You McCain always at your traitor worst 
It would be good if politicians come back from yet another vacation and do the people's business!
You Mean You're Not Dead Yet? Well, Make it Snappy Old Boy bc We want to put a Loyal American in Your Seat. You Soros Ads Kisser
Love it!
Soros says to send email.
Soros says to meet him in Switzerland again.....

I'm sick I supported Romney and McCain, even Rubio as a Senator. Who would've known they'd deliberately try to hurt a Republican president.
Your damn dogs probably a traitor too!!!
this is a freudian slip video

you subconsciously want to call the dogs off of @POTUS cuz you know you can sell weapons and wars go on!
Hi Burma! I was in a tidal river today!
The dog looks satanic like your family.
What a cutie!
You have a Chesapeake!!!! Loved ours  -so much !!
At least I like your dog...

Burma need investor by Int'l investors n Burma citizen's money. if Burma leaders choose dictate's. Burma must meet China n China way.
Burma leaders do as before leaders from military power. It's fit to Global Companies n Investors...This kind of policies will meet limits.
You voted against american people over a grudge against our President

It's getting close. Maybe this is a further sign. We can only hope this ISIS enabling demon burns in hell soon.

Hey Senator, care to explain this? Didnt think so hypocrite.
Dogs soothe the soul

John McCain was a failed presidential candidate, a terrible pilot who spilled the beans to the Vietnamese and a useless senator! Soros bitch
Do us all a favor and stay with your dog the country and party don't need you anymore we think you've done enough damage in 30yrs
Sweet dog!
