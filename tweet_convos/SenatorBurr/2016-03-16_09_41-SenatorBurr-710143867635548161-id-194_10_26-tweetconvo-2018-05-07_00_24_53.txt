@SenatorBurr The American people spoke already. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Do your job or be considered a traitor to the U.S. Constitution. #CongressionalTraitors
@SenatorBurr DO YOUR JOB!
@SenatorBurr the American people have made their voice clear in two terms for our President. Consider the nominee and accept him.
@SenatorBurr and if you want to get re elected, NC voters agree. This nominee will NOT support the 2nd amendment. Don't fall for BHO's trap.
@SenatorBurr I am one of "the American people" and from your state! #DoYourJob and move forward NOW on Supreme Court nomination.
@SenatorBurr Do your job, or we will replace you with someone who will.
@SenatorBurr This is why people hate the GOP #doyourjob or lose it.
@SenatorBurr Americans also deserve representatives who will work for them. #DoYourJob and vote for #SCOTUSnominee. Don't care how you vote.
@SenatorBurr For obstructing the SC appt, you should go to jail for committing fraud on the American public #CongressionalFraud
@SenatorBurr Do you think we don't see through your nonsense?  We HAVE a president now. Respect him and us and #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr the American people has a voice. In 2012. You don't get to ignore elections because you don't like the results.
@SenatorBurr So it's ok to discount "my say" when I voted for Barack Obama!! Do you your job and hold a hearing & vote for Merrick Garland
@SenatorBurr So how does it feel to admit that you are a political hack and party lackey instead of a statesman? #doyourjob #youembarrassNC
@SenatorBurr Also the way the odds are looking, wouldn't you much rather have a moderate in the SC than a liberal? #Trumpaintgoingtowin
@SenatorBurr More North Carolinians voted for @Potus in 2 elections than voted for you in either of yours.  #DoYourJob!
@SenatorBurr  I am a voter with a voice & you are disrespecting me & others like me by stifling it. #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@SenatorBurr As a North Carolinian & American who votes, I say #DoYourJob #OneVotersVoice
@SenatorBurr lets make sure the party sticks to that and doesn't cave yet once again!
@SenatorBurr Yes, Sen., ur right, & they have a voice in Pres. Obama, who was reelected in a landslide. He's done his job, now you do yours.
@SenatorBurr President Obama is carrying out his duty in picking #SCOTUSnominee. Do your job. Voters are watching and waiting.
@SenatorBurr What about the 2012 election result giving Barack Obama the Presidency?!
@SenatorBurr DISAGREE! Three branches of gov't execute their respective roles. Meet the nominee, conduct a hearing #doyourjob
.@SenatorBurr They already made their voice clear when they elected President Obama!  Did you forget?
@SenatorBurr You should be ashamed of yourself. Stop stealing from the American taxpayer and just DO YOUR JOB! #CongressionalThieves
@SenatorBurr We The People deserve our pick for Rep candidate. STOP HELPING LIBERAL LEFT DESTROY THE CONSTITUTION & OUR COUNTRY! TRUMP!
@SenatorBurr Please do not vote to allow President Obama's Supreme Court choice become a member! He has a terrible record against gun rights
@SenatorBurr The people chose President Obama. Now grab a copy of the Constitution, and do your job. Or resign if you don't want to.
@SenatorBurr Since you're up for reelection, please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Are you suggesting we change the constitution and vote for SCOTUS?
I like the idea of voting for SCOTUS!
@SenatorBurr, @POTUS is the voice of the American People like it or not. That is the constitution #respectthepeoplesvoice
@SenatorBurr vote no and wait on the next pres to nominate.
@SenatorBurr American people telling you:  do your work! President Obama's duty to nominate Supreme Court Justice. Stop obstructing Justice!
@SenatorBurr, @POTUS did his job in nominating a justice. Do yours. After @HillaryClinton or @SenSanders win, you'll long for Obama days.
@SenatorBurr hold hearing and vote up or down or I'll vote you out of office.
@SenatorBurr SIR. The gamesmanship in Amer. politics is appalling.  do you job.  You don't have to vote for him, but tell us why/not.
@SenatorBurr I am a North Carolinian and my voice says #DoYourJob, Convene and decide on Mr. Garland.
@SenatorBurr The people do have voice..POTUS elected for 4 years...you were elected for 6..not 5..so DO YOUR JOB! #scotusnom #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorBurr The American People Spoke 4 years ago!  Do your job!  Fill the vacancy now!
@maryjchris @randyprine @SenatorBurr Actually, not quite "4 years ago" so the opposition should STILL remember unless they have Alzheimers
@SenatorBurr They made their voice clear when Obama was elected to a 2nd term.
@SenatorBurr The American people have a voice. They elected President Obama to two FULL terms. Vote on the Supreme Court nominee!
@SenatorBurr   The Amercian people have a voice.  The senate and POTUS.  Body your constitutional duty Mr. Burr.
@SenatorBurr we had a voice in 2012. You just don't get the message of Trump. Do your job
@SenatorBurr we made our voice known in 2008 and 2012.  DO YOUR JOB.
@SenatorBurr American People spoke -- twice.  Your failure to do your Constitutional duty is a disservice to the American people.
@SenatorBurr The American people's voice says: do yer job.
@SenatorBurr Senator, the American said Barack Obama should appoint justices for the next four years. Not 3 years. Do your duty.
@SenatorBurr The American people have their voice in our duly elected President. #DoYourJob and consider #SCOTUS nomination NOW. Up or down.
.@SenatorBurr The american people used their voice for @POTUS twice for 4 year terms. Not 3 & a partial #partypolitics #SCOTUS #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr The American people had their say four years ago. The overwhelming majority said they wanted @BarackObama to lead this country.
@SenatorBurr That's not how the Constitution works. Obama is still president. Reagan got Kennedy on the bench in his last year. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Like the voice that elected Obama twice to fulfill his Constitutional duties? #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Yes, we deserve a voice. And our voice elected @BarackObama in 2008 and 2012. Your obstructionist nonsense needs to stop.
@SenatorBurr Agreed. You should also let our other soon to be 1 term Senator know. @SenThomTillis
@SenatorBurr We already did. In 2012. When @POTUS @BarackObama defeated your guy by +5 million votes. #DoYourJob! #SCOTUS
@SenatorBurr  We The People are telling you "DO YOUR JOB!"  Give Garland a vote #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Have you and your fellow republicans even given consideration to the fact that the American People spoke Obama was elected.
@SenatorBurr My voice was heard.  Twice.  #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr The American people had a voice in the next #SCOTUS appointment when they elected @BarackObama to a second term. Do your job.
@SenatorBurr yes @POTUS is the American voice of choice. Do your job and interview the candidate #NCVoter
@SenatorBurr let's not pretend the people vote on the court.  The people voted for the POTUS, all you need to do is have a fair hearing.
@SenatorBurr this is a code word for you not doing your constitutionally required job.  You have lost my vote.
@SenatorBurr The American People had a voice when we elected @POTUS ! TWICE!!! Now do you job and hold the Confirmation hearings!
@SenatorBurr We made our voice heard when we elected @BarackObama. Do your job and confirm his nominee for #SCOTUS #doyourjob
.@SenatorBurr Count on them using their voice come November when you seek re-election and people wonder why when you won't #DoYourJob.
@SenatorBurr In a representative democracy, we elect members of Congress to be our voice.
@SenatorBurr How do you think the 2014 election would have turned out if more people had voted?  Like when we elected Obama.  #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr We had a voice when @POTUS was voted into office twice. Take action. #Obstructionism does not bode well for you or your party.
@SenatorBurr American people who voted for Obama for this current term deserve to be heard.
Stop this partisan obstruction. DO YOUR JOB!
.@SenatorBurr you should at least #doyourjob and give the man a hearing. You and your fellow Rs are acting like children. #SCOTUS
@SenatorBurr The people of NC deserve a Senator who will rise above. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr #doyourjob or lose the election in November. Merrick Garland is an outstanding jurist and is well respected by all sides.
@SenatorBurr  Obama is stirring the pot     He can't stay out of the fight  he thinks the republicans will fold like the they usually do.
.@SenatorBurr when we vote u out of office. #DoYourJob #NoMorePayDay
@SenatorBurr look at the polls and tell us how you're giving Americans a voice when we just want you to actually #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr I thought I made my voice pretty clear in the last election in North Carolina? Are you saying it doesn't matter in year 4?
the American people spoke when we re-elected President Obama and we expect you to work with him. @SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr I think I speak for a lot of North Carolinians who want you to be more beholden to us than a party line.
@SenatorBurr They HAD 1 Sir, they VOTED 4 @BarackObama TWICE
& its HIS JOB 2 fulfill the seat of the #SCOTUS & We expect U 2DO UR JOB NOW
@SenatorBurr  sigh, I had hoped you would above this nonsense. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr We're watching. We did our job in 2012. Kiss your Cush job goodbye. You have Zero integrity
keep singing that tune, and my vote will go against you, @SenatorBurr. Love, 27713
@SenatorBurr The American people spoke by electing  Pres Obama TWICE. #DoYourJob and respect our voice. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorBurr please re-read the constitution and get back to me.

@SenatorBurr That election you cite had 37% voter turnout by the way.
@SenatorBurr We have a voice Senator! We chose @BarackObama with it. Time to #DoYourJob
.@SenatorBurr Please give Mr. Garland a fair hearing. The People's voice was heard in 2012 & Pres Obama's pick is reasonable #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorBurr #doyourjob maybe you should look to the constitution for guidance on this??
@SenatorBurr All due respect: as you are well aware, the public elected Obama twice. We did our job and exercised our voice. #doyourjob
@SenatorBurr you have 35k followers and this tweet got 15 likes
@SenatorBurr, we HAVE had our voice..we chose President Obama.  He has done HIS job.  Do YOUR job, sir. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr We have had our voice in electing Obama.  Support the Constitution and consider the nominee. It's YOUR job.
@SenatorBurr We gave voice/Majority of voters & majority of NC voters want #SCOTUS seat filled this year.#FlipaSenateseat #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorBurr We have a voice. We voted the President and Congress into office. Why do you say we don't have a voice?
@SenatorBurr #DoYourJob and reflect the will of your constituents! Serve your people!
@SenatorBurr  We voted in 2012. He's still the president.
@SenatorBurr please have the hearing the immaturity of Congress is scaring me
@SenatorBurr I contemplated not doing my professional duties but patients need care. This swing voter will recall your position. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Yes they do, and they have spoken #DoYourJob
.@SenatorBurr the American people reelected @BarackObama. He has 300 days left in office. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Although I voted for you yesterday in the primary, I disagree with your logic. Hold a hearing and vote no if unacceptable.
@SenatorBurr do your job and fulfill the obligations required by the constitution and hold the hearings and vote yes or no.
@SenatorBurr nearly 66 million people had their say when they voted for Obama. Twice. #DYFJ
@SenatorBurr Did they shorten the presidential term and I missed it?
@SenatorBurr they have #DoYourJob #orresign
@SenatorBurr is a Marco "I only show up for work on Payday" Rubio Republican, a LAZY coward who steals his $170,000 paycheck
@SenatorBurr the American people have a voice, they elected President Obama. Do your job Senator. Hold hearings and a vote.
@SenatorBurr Yes we do! We elected a president (twice!) who has 307 days left in term. It's disrespectful to us not to vote. #doyourjob
@SenatorBurr Yes, and that voice was when they elected a president to serve four years in 2012
@SenatorBurr I seem to remember the American people voiced their opinion when they elected this President. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Senator Burr, I think you're going to hear the voices in NC loud and clear this November.
@SenatorBurr You're apparently unfamiliar w/ the actual text & mandates of our U.S. Constitution. Shameful. #SCOTUS #ncsen @DeborahRossNC
@SenatorBurr The American people deserve representatives who are not oathbreakers. Yours was to uphold the Constitution not the GOP.
@SenatorBurr do your job. If not, I'll take that as your resignation. #SCOTUS
@SenatorBurr we did have our voice now #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr We have a voice Sir, you.The nominee deserves a hearing, and if the nomination moves to the full Senate, an up or down vote.
@SenatorBurr How about you park The Thing and follow the Constitution that you love only when convenient and Do Your Job! We have spoken.
.@SenatorBurr Certainly the people deserve a voice, and they spoke very clearly Nov. 6, 2012.   #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Thank you, I have never been this excited to vote someone out of office.
@SenatorBurr Please do your job according to the Constitution.  We voted Obama in twice.  His Supreme Court nominee deserves a hearing.
@SenatorBurr In what way do we, the American people, not have (nor already had) a voice in the nomination of the next Supreme Court justice?
@SenatorBurr   The American people had a say...President Obama was elected (twice) He is doing his job, now do yours!!! Stop obstructing!
.@SenatorBurr cant wait to see who Madam President Clinton nominates! #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Do your job.
@SenatorBurr that is an idiotic position. Just resign. You don't want to do your job. Don't take the money.
@SenatorBurr The American people have a say. We elected the president. He did his job, you should do yours.
@SenatorBurr The American people had the voice. You have the Senate and the House to #DoYourJob, not to obstruct the democratic process.
.@SenatorBurr The people deserve knowledge of what's in their food. Why aren't you on this list? #DARKact http://act.foodpolicyaction.com/page/s/sign-the-card-thank-senators-for-blocking-the-dark-act …
.@SenatorBurr right...when we elected Obama twice. Scalia died under this President. Sorry dude I hate it for ya.
@SenatorBurr The American people spoke in 2012 giving @BarackObama a 2nd term, including a very large number of NCians.
@SenatorBurr here's my voice #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Congress REPRESENTS the voice of American people.  Is that not correct?  Are you suggesting a popular referendum?
.@SenatorBurr And as one of those people, I want you to #DoYourJob and not leave a seat empty for an entire year. #obstructionofjustice
@SenatorBurr so right, thank god for executive orders.
@SenatorBurr I appreciate many of your stances, but hope Senators put aside politics & give the judge a fair hearing. SC needs to function.
@SenatorBurr Are you going to refrain from all voting for the rest of the year, to "let the people have a voice?" #MindlessPartisanship
@SenatorBurr The entire point of the Supreme Court is that they're not beholden to the will of the people. Checks and balances.
@SenatorBurr  THIS just cost you my vote. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenatorBurr We, the voters, had our voice when we elected the President to another 4-year term in 2012. #DoYourJob and give Garland a vote.
@SenatorBurr We got one, in 2012. You just don't like what our voice told you. #DoYourjob
We elected the President twice. We've used our voice. Stop using us as a reason to be a child and #DoYourJob, @SenatorBurr
@KristineWyllys
@SenatorBurr You are expected to #DoYourJob and let @POTUS do his.
@SenatorBurr #DoYourJob - you took an oath to uphold the Constitution. Flaunting this for partisan politics is disgusting.
@TAW3343 @SenatorBurr is it not true that this exact same predicament took place in 2008- Obama voted and lobbied to wait? #doublestandard
@SenatorBurr as an angry #NCVoter I urge you to reconsider this.  do the job the citizens of NC hired you to do!!   #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr  #doyourjob  since your party can't seem to create any jobs it would be nice to see you actually DO YOURS. Obama won twice
. @SenatorBurr #doyourjob listen to us, don’t politicize this, hold the hearings. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Exactly.  So listen to the people and #doyourjobcongress.  Aren't you current Senators competent enough to hold hearings?
@SenatorBurr the american people's voice was heard when electing @POTUS who nominated #scotus. your turn.  #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Are you suggesting Founding Fathers were wrong when they gave the Pres authority to nominate SCOTUS replacements? #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr we did speak...put republican majority in senate to stop the country lurching to the left #stricconstitutionalistonly
@SenatorBurr I'm from Winston too, but won't vote for you if you deny a modest, moderate, qualified man a Constitutionally mandated hearing.
@SenatorBurr our voice was heard in 2012. We will be louder this year and vote Deborah Ross #rossisboss
@SenatorBurr The American people have a voice, twice elected til Jan 2017, who just nominated Judge Garland.
@SenatorBurr we did in 2012.  Will think of this in November when deciding to vote for you or not.  #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr A majority of Americans spoke with a loud voice on 6 November, 2012. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr You'll lose votes if obstruct as citizens are overwhelmingly in favor of #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Our voice was heard when we elected Obama twice. #doyourjob and consider his nomination. The American people deserve that.
@SenatorBurr The people have made their voice heard, 2008, 2012. Stop being childish & intentionally obstructive. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
.@SenatorBurr We *did* have a voice. In 2012 we re-elected @BarackObama. He’s President until Jan 20, 2017. Grow up and #doyourjob.
@SenatorBurr Playing politics with our Constitution. You're up for reelection ya know. Why are you taking a year off? #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr Will you stand by this under President Clinton? Asking as a person who voted for you yesterday #DoYourJob #SCOTUS
@SenatorBurr I'm a Republican but what you guys are doing is childish payback. ..be the adults here and do the right thing!
@SenatorBurr  The American people voted for the #POTUS who did his job... #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr They had a voice in 2012. By your logic, presidents shouldn't nominate anyone, for anything, for half their terms.
@SenatorBurr Please stand your ground. You won the Primary...so dont stop fighting now.
@SenatorBurr The constitution gives us that voice through our Senators.  As mine, I expect you to #DoYourJob and put this to a vote.
