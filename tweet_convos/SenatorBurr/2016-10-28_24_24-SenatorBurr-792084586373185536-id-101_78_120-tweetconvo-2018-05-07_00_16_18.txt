What's "high treason"? She didn't have anything to do w/them. She didn't send or receive them
@NCGOP It's a good thing this wasn't announced in a committee meeting or you would most likely missed it.
GOP-led Congress has already spent more time on their Clinton witch hunt than anything else. You guys are a total joke.

Deflecting from the fact that you're poised to lose? I think so. Look at early voting. Dems taking the Senate! Bye Burr!
@StuPolitics where are Trump's taxes? We deserve to see them.
@kimoli07 Who knows when Wikileaks would release all emails of GOP electives ?
Delete your account. You are an embarrassment to North Carolina.

@StuPolitics how about shut the hell up until I have the facts.
@StuPolitics her campaign just called on the FBI to release all the information about her so I guess you agree with clinton?
@StuPolitics burr your a loser with no good ideas . Go away.  #gopcult.
.@SenatorBurr So you MUST be in favor of @realDonaldTrump releasing his tax returns, right? Otherwise you're a #hypocrite
@twright55 there have been many notable presidents that deleted their emails! I will have some examples for you later.
So what were the 9 republican led congressional investigations that found nothing and wasted our tax dollars?
@BrentWoodcox WE have giving the republicans a chance to prove all the rumors and theories. Still hasnt happen.
Emails not sent by her, related to Anthony Weiner sexting scandal. Take a breath.
@twright55 and Javis too now we know why he changed his tune. Investigate him now.
