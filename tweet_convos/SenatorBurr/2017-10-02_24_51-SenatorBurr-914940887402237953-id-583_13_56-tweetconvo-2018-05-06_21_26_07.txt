My understanding on the Second Amendment to our constitution, it was intended for the organized militia to own guns not by all individual.
Please stop taking $ from the NRA & pass gun regulation.
How about the $6,986,620 you've taken from the N.R.A.?
yeah but you taking $9,900 from the NRA makes you part of the problem and part of the reason this sort of thing happens.
How do we take you seriously when you've been bought and paid for by the NRA?
How's about you donate the $6.9M you've received from the NRA to the victims? They'd appreciate that far more than your hollow words.
Hollow, meaningless rhetoric! You are 100% #complicit in murder, preacher's son! You should be ashamed! #Deplorable
Prayers?  Why don't you give back the $8M that the NRA gave you and outlaw assault weapons?
this guy is a democrat in actions
You accept money from the NRA. You have the victims' blood on your hands.
R u going to return NRA’s donation?
How'd ya' spend the $6,986,620 you got from NRA to sell out North Carolinians you swore an oath to serve? Your prayers mean nothing. #NRA
Your statement should be an apology for allowing this assault-rifle carnage to continue just so you can collect your checks from the NRA.
@SenatorBurr you should pray for your soul. That &6,986,620 you got from the @NRA is blood money and your soul is bought with it. Soldusall


Calling the Las Vegas mass shooting the deadliest ever whitewashes U.S. history. 

Give the money you got from the NRA to the shooting victims.
Why not you give the $4,000,000.00 you received from the NRA to the victims?
enforce the laws on crimminals and leave the guns alone because guns alone dont kill , it is the wicked people with guns that kill
You have received almost $7 million from the NRA. You are #2 in the nation. Thoughts and prayers are no longer enough.
Now is the time to talk about Gun Control.  It could easily have been my children in Las Vegas.  @Everytown  @resp_solutions  #assaultweaponban
Try introducing a LAW to prohibit bump-stocks or save your empty words. Stop letting NRA dictate ur agenda and save Americans
Berkeley troll farms are real and are apparent in this thread. I support the NRA. Criminals don't obey laws.  Stop politicizing death, left
Will you be returning the  you received from the NRA & vote 4 stricter laws? Or will they continue to own you? $6,986,620 FROM THE N.R.A.


Senator- phrase u r looking for is "blood on your hands". 
"no place in America"... thats rich.  "made in America"?
You have of nerve saying UR "praying" for the victims when you've taken $6,986,620 from the NRA. DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN LINE YOUR POCKETS!!
Senator Burr, please stop these senseless acts from happening. Listen to your constituents and ban assault weapons.
You are a poser...and posers often pick the wrong side. America is behind @POTUS Burr is Warner's little lackey boy.
take your prayers with you to the gates of hell #NRA
our statement to you #NRA shill how can you sleep at night #VoteThemOut
@SenatorBurr But why have you taken almost $7 million from the NRA?



Look! These Senators send "thoughts & prayers" check out how much $ they get from @NRA @ThomTillis @SenatorBurr https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-nra-funding-senators.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur …
Maybe you should stop taking NRA money.... hypocrite
Instead of praying what about passing sensible gun laws or you don’t want to lose the NRA $$? #GunContolNow #ThisIsCorruption
Burr received $6,986,620 from the NRA. Please show you're not beholden to the lobby and support common sense regs.
S H A M E  O N  Y O U

$6,986,620 worth of #ThoughtsandPrayers funded by the @NRA #GunContolNow

Sending your 'thoughts and prayers' while having your hand out stretched for NRA money.  This shooting is on you & ur NRA buddies.
No words, please. DO something right for a change!
Any words on on how you are to blame for the shooting?
Here's a statement. You took $8 million from the gun lobby to make sure people have access to unnecessary weapons. Disingenuous sir #NoNRA
You’ve accepted nearly $7M from @NRA  Your words mean nothing. Make change happen today #EndGunViolence

Your words ring hollow and your actions lack integrity. Stop accepting NRA bribes and start protecting your constituents.
You've taken nearly $7 million from the NRA. Your prayers are meaningless.
How do you square your "thoughts and prayers" with the $6,986,620 you've recieved over the span of your career from the NRA? Hypocrite much?
So how does God answer a man who takes money in exchange for letting people get slaughtered every day? Do you think he takes your calls?
Here's mine: how's your 6.3 million in blood money helping u sleep at night? how many have 2 die 2 make u change ur mind? #nofreedom4thedead
Pray 6,986,620 minutes for the Las Vegas victims, one for every NRA $ you took. Will take over 13 yrs & make no difference
Are you going to do anything about it? Thoughts and prayers are not enough.
Universal background chks, ban bump stocks or anything changing a semi into a de facto automatic, ban silencers. We could all agree on these
You accepted blood money from NRA. #EndGunViolence
$6,986,620 FROM THE N.R.A    HYPOCRITE!!!
You bear responsibility for all of these mass shootings with all the NRA finding you've received- $7mil! Do something!
SenBurr:The NRA paid you just under $6 MILLION dollars. You support the NRA and making Machine Guns accessible to all people.#LV on U&NRA
http://wurdsfromtheburbs.blogspot.com/2015/10/another-mass-shooting-ho-hum.html …
The USA needs to heal and move forward. The #witchhunt holds back unity. @potus has #vagasshooting and #hurricanerelief . Stop #RussiaGate
Seems your constituents overwhelmingly support gun control. Guessing we won't get your support. NRA to Burr 2016: $124,550
I don't understand, you are also to blame for the shooting, mass murder, you took $9,900 from the NRA, you are part of the problem!
Keeping mentally ill from guns is against 2ndA but a video on how to change a semi into an auto is free speech?
Are you going to support Sen. Feinstein’s bill to ban “bump stocks”? This needs to pass right now. #URGENT
My statement on YOU:  You crooked m'fers have to GO!  #DrainTheSewer (YOU!) #LockYOUUp #WeKnow #MAGA
So you recd over 40K from the NRA in 2016. Don’t you think that influences his judgement?
You took money from the NRA so your prayers are hypocritical. DO something - vote AGAINST S. 446 #VegasShooting #SandyHook #LasVegas
Why did you accept $124,550 from gun lobbyists in the 2016 election cycle? What will you do about gun violence?
It wasn't too early for 59 people in Las Vegas Sunday night, Richard...
If not now, when?
You call yourself a Christian yet promote evil....I guess God doesn’t donate to any Republican PACs that pay you&your colleagues to vote.
I hold you and every member of the senate and congress responsible for allowing this man to continue to destroy and divide this nation.
You keep praying and the NRA keeps paying you-Hows that working for the American people?
#ThoughtsandPrayers r NOT ENUFF, you hypocrite. U took $10k from #NRA in 2016. This domestic terrorist's actions ARE ON U. #GunControlNow!!
Not much of a statement. How are you going to help end gun violence and enact common sense gun regulations? #republicanswillletithappenagain
I hope the $9900 from the NRA in 2016 was worth the price of your soul. You have blood on your hands that can never be wiped clean.
2/2 Mass shootings on an almost daily basis has become part of America thanks to lawmakers in NRA pockets. 8M in blood money, sick.
Same as Orlando. You are an #NRAtool and have no business voting on anything having to do with guns, called conflict of interest. 1/2
NRA 2016 contributions:
Burr, Richard (R-NC)Senate$9,900
$9,900 from the @NRA
Agreed. Now please do something about it! You are one of a few folks in this country that can make a change.
@SenatorBurr Gun Control Laws are needed now.  #SandyHook, #Orlando, #LV doesn’t need prayers, they need gun laws.  #Vegas won’t be the last
NRA lapdog. Blood of innocents on your hands. Since you aren't going to do anything but pray, go ahead and resign.
@SenatorBurr Are you still praying or are you busy doing? NC and the country need you.
Thank you Senator
We see that you’re in bed with @NRA @SenatorBurr.  We don’t want your prayers. We want a functioning government. The blood is on your hands.

i believe n the 2nd amendment, but there has to be an improvement. common sense changes that can keep firearms out of the hands of criminals
Prayers are not enough, change the gun laws. You accepted donations from the NRA.  You have blood on your hands.
I'd say you're a person of interest in the tragic deaths of those people. #complicit #NRAPayroll
but yet you received $9,900 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle #BeThere #SenatorRichardBurr @SenatorBurr
Oh no Dick, the $6.2M ad contribution from the NRA & gun lobby render your thoughts & prayers meaningless.
How many need to die senselessly, do the Republicans have a set number? Annual quota? Please tell us what that number is.
I bet some of those shooting victims could use some of that $9,900 NRA money you received. Too bad all you have is thoughts and prayers.
Every time we have a tragedy like this the R's say this is not the time to talk about sensible gun control. Then when?
NRA blood money!
Your prayers mean nothing actions do. Until you say no to the NRA blood money these victim's blood is on your hands to.
8 million from the NRA Senator??? How do you sleep at night?
As a resident of Charlotte I can confidently say that nothing you have done represents me or my views. #GunControlNow #NoPrayers
#GiveBacktheBloodMoney #ImpeachTrump #RepresentMe
Ru ready to give up NRA donations and come out against HEAR & SHARE, and support #NoGunControl @senatorburr
Please stop taking money from the @NRA, Mr. Burr. This can't continue. We need MORE gun control, not more politicians taking money for less.
Hollow words if you don't take any action. We need sensible, common sense gun control already, my God.
Your "thoughts and prayers" do nothing. Stop taking money from NRA and pass sensible #GunControlNow
Prayers are good, but we need common sense gun regulation.  No one needs a semiautomatic gun or silencer for sport or protection.
You can keep praying. But taking all that money from the NRA shows you don’t really care about the people that die at the hands of guns.
Make political contributions illegal. Money and greed are running the country; not common sense and goodwill to all.
Matthew 5:9 Jesus "Blessed are the peacemakers." Do you want to leave a positive legacy? Do the right thing. BE A HERO. STAND UP TO THE NRA.
#GunControlNow
You are a domestic terrorist! NRATHE LOSS OF INOCENT LIVES IS A RESULT OF YOUR INACTION! SHAME SHAME SHAME ON YOU!
Kushner private emails! Lock her up! VOTE FOR SILENCERS SO INSANE PEOPLE CAN SET UP CLANDESTINE SNIPER NESTS! NRA SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!
Didn't you receive over 6 million form the NRA? Many politicians take too much $ from rich greedy fools + ignore safety + our common good.
And preventing future victims with gun reform? Save your prayers for yourself. God knows how much blood you have on your hands, for $9,900
No place?
You took $40,650 from #NRA to ensure lax gun laws.
You are #Complicit in #LasVegasMassacre
My statement on the tragic events in Las Vegas: https://www.burr.senate.gov/press/releases/senator-burrs-statement-on-las-vegas-shooting …
Your work in the Senate can only be called pathetic, spineless, and unworthy. What a do nothing, know nothing congress.
You are part of the problem, sad that you could have been part of he solution. Shame on you. Waste of space.
And you also won't vote to legalize SILENCERS
If you mean this, you'll return the NRA donations to you back to the NRA and refuse to accept any future $$$
While I am glad you say you are a believer, We do not pay you to pray.  We pay you to do something. so DO SOMETHING. #tiredofinaction
You are in a unique position to help stop this. Please do SOMETHING about gun violence. Surely we can do better. Sincerely, your constituent
Thoughts and prayers are meaningless, insulting and hypocritical without ACTION. You have blood on your hands. #GunContolNow
I think you have a file on your computer marked “NRA approved” you just call up after each mass shooting. #GunControlNow
You accepted $9,900 from the NRA last year. Each dollar is smeared with the blood of a victim of gun violence. Congrats.
Said the guy who is owned by the NRA.  The only thing you care about are the corporations who own you.  You're disgusting.
You allow these killing sprees to happen in America by being an #NRA puppet. Their blood is on your hands  #NRATerrorism #notmassshooting
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Save your useless words and just #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Your elected responsibility is to vote for change, not just pray for victims.
#GunControlNow
You took over $6 million from #NRA and voted against the last restriction bill. A republican in Dem clothing. Shame on you.


This makes me sick:
How much money have you received from the gun lobby?
If you think these events have no place in America then use your position to enact common sense gun laws NOW. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
The Constitution wasn’t talking about automatic & semi-automatic weapons, Senator. It’s time for more than thoughts & prayers. #guncontrol
Your my senator. I don't want to hear about prayers. I want real federal laws regulating guns.
But you've taken $6.2 million dollars from the NRA? 
Could CARE LESS about your statement. 59 lives were lost. The American people need your VOTE not your weak condolences #SensibleGunLaws
My statement? You should pray that you will #GrowASpine and tell the NRA to keep their blood money. Do something! Or #ResignNow!
Dont just send prayers, do something. Or does the NRA's $$ matter more to you than human lives?
@NRA and stop taking money from these guys?
You are a sham; representing no one but those who have bought your soul. It sold cheap, didn't it?
Just curious Senator, what would you be doing if Brooke was one of the victims? Praying or doing something to address gun violence?
Your condolences mean nothing when you receive almost $10k from the NRA last election. Get out of bed with NRA and do your job. #guncontrol
Praying for your own soul since you are employed by the gun lobby? Remember, you are actively part of the problem. Keep your prayers, sir.
Your prayers are pointless if you continue to take money from the NRA. We don't believe your sentiment.
That didn't stop you from taking millions from the .@NRA
Your statement will say it is not the time to discuss gun control.  Let us know whe n.
You received huge donations from the NRA. That's more important to you than keeping Americans alive.
Then give back the $40k you took from the NRA.
You're right. There's no place for violence like this in America. Maybe you should have thought of that before you took $35K from the NRA
OH dear god no. Let me guess your 'thoughts and prayers"  You're the 3rd top recipient of NRA dirty blood money
Please vote NO on Senate Bill 446 (conceal & carry) and support common sense gun control. We need you to step up and protect us in NC.
Hey North Carolina, the NRA owns your Senator! Vote him out of office! You deserve better!
You'll be praying for victims & their families? While taking NRA $$, refusing to pass common sense gun laws & enabling future mass murders?
Respectfully Senator, that is not enough. Do something! One man shot almost 600 people at an outdoor concert. Stop voting with the NRA!
$6.2 million from NRA. Shame on you.
Save your prayers for yourself. You'll need them when you meet your maker. #bloodonyourhands
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Then do something and pass sensible gun control of auto weapons, and stop being in pocket of NRA!
Clearly (from all the other mass shootings) your prayers don't work. Stop taking money from NRA and pass gun control legislation!

Screw your prayers. You are a United States Senator. DO SOMETHING! Or does $9900 from the NRA make that impossible?
I'm a constituent from Winston. You voted against banning assault weapons. You voted against banning high capacity magazines. Be ashamed.
stop waiting and start acting. Give the @NRA their campaign contribution back and enact some true gun control #PrayForLasVegas
Yet you have excepted nearly $10,000 from the NRA this year. Thoughts and prayers only go so far. Gun regulation NOW.
Sadly owning weapons of mass destruction is considered a right, but #healthcare a privilege, by many @GOP! @NRA +other rich greedy jerks FU!
Show some leadership. Stop taking @nra money and support responsibile gun legislation.
Urge you to take intimidate action on gun control. All we're asking for are sensible regulations which comply w/US Constitution and reason.
