@SenatorBurr our current president still has almost a year in office. Quit making up the constitution! #SupremeCourt
@SenatorBurr I'm sure you'd say the same w/ GOP president :/ At least this means President Hillary Clinton can appoint Pres Obama to SCOTUS
@SenatorBurr read constitution the  President should nominate  a supreme  court nomination and your job is to consider the nomination
@SenatorBurr The people DID have a say! Elected a pres in 2012 and chose Pres Obama 2 nominate vacancies for 4 years. That's how it works
@clayaiken @SenatorBurr they had another say in 2014...when you lost
.@SenatorBurr As one of the American people and a voting North Carolinian, my will is to have a fully functional court. Fill the vacancy.
@SenatorBurr  Also President Obama is working under a 4 year contract. You and your party do not have the right to change it to a three year
@SenatorBurr idiot
@SenatorBurr funny how you only support the constitution when it supports your political agenda. #POTUS #ItsObamasChoice
@SenatorBurr The people had their say when the President was elected twice. Stop obstructing the process and #doyourjob
@SenatorBurr the American people do have a say...hold hearings and confirm a new justice...NOW.
@SenatorBurr You can't budge on this, our liberties hang in the balance. We can't afford another activist jurist to sit on the High Court
@SenatorBurr we will have our say when we vote you out of office.
@SenatorBurr The American did have a say, they spoke loud and clear by reelecting Pres. Obama in 2012.
.@SenatorBurr You should say WON'T be filled until we get new prez.  #NoHearingsNoVotes #SCOTUS #NoScotus4Potus
@SenatorBurr we had a say in 2012. now let our @potus put forth his nominee. the gop does not own the seat in question
@SenatorBurr If the United States was attacked, would you Sen Burr expect President Obama to do his job then. I hope we vote you out.
@SenatorBurr then shouldn't NC citizens have had a say in the creation and voting of HB2?
@SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr We had our say - remember how we re-elected President Obama three years ago?
@SenatorBurr Shame on you. NC deserves a Senator who respects the Constitution.
@LeahPetersen @SenatorBurr. Senate doesn't have to confirm...where in the constitution does it say they have to agree with appointees?
@SenatorBurr Richard, I hope and pray that you won't relent on this issue.This is too important.
.@SenatorBurr NO-If you refuse to vote JUST because Obama nominated, wave goodbye to your seat. NC voter with a big mouth here. #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr We elected Pres. Obama TWICE to do his job & make a nomination. Why don't you do yours? #SCOTUS
@theechriswhite @SenatorBurr NC only voted for him once..he didn't win NC..Burr represents NC not Obama
.@SenatorBurr The American people by a majority had their say and said they want President Obama making these decisions.
@sweetbay @SenatorBurr same goes for house and senate...conservatives will choose to confirm or not ..co equal branches of Govt
@SenatorBurr I can't wait to see you voted out Mr Burr.
@SenatorBurr should be uninstalled 100% from public
@SenatorBurr The American people do deserve a say.  And that say was the last election - or do those votes not count because the GOP lost?
@SenatorBurr “I think we fall into the trap if just simply say sight unseen, we fall into the trap of being obstructionists” ~Thom Tillis
@SenatorBurr Also Obama hasn't managed an approval rating over 50% since 2009....Don't let his sheep scare you they don't represent America
@SenatorBurr You must do everything in your power to stop a politicized appointee, no matter what that no-talent clown @clayaiken says.
@SenatorBurr The people had their say in 2008 and 2012!! We said we wanted Obama to fill any vacancy on the Supreme Court!
@SenatorBurr We did in 2012 when we elected our current POTUS. It is not complicated.
@SenatorBurr We had our say by electing @BarackObama  and his #SCOTUS nomination is his constitutional duty.Now I expect you to do your job
@SenatorBurr We had our say by electing @BarackObama to perform his constitutional duties.Now I expect you to do your job  #SCOTUS  #NCVoter
@SenatorBurr Using your logic in your election year, please refrain from voting for the rest of this year.  You can't have it both ways!
@SenatorBurr The American people DID have a say. When they elected Obama. Obama is still the fairly elected president. Stop the obstruction.
@SenatorBurr you just lost my vote for reelection. You can't support the constitution when it's convenient. #donothingcongress
@SenatorBurr How have the American people /not/ already had a say here?
@SenatorBurr U think people should work to pay our way. U should do that 2. Stalling means your successor may have 2 vote for a liberal.
@SenatorBurr do your job!
.@SenatorBurr We did, in November of 2012. Pres. Obama is still the president until Jan.2017. He'll do his job. Please do yours, sir.
@SenatorBurr We had a say & want the Pres. to do his job. Just as we in NC want YOU to do your job;not act the petulant child! #shameBurr
@SenatorBurr No precedence for the ridiculous idea that a President should neglect his duties to please the opposing party. Poor form Sen.
@SenatorBurr we did have a say we voted for him to be our President. Time for you to do your job. If you can't resign
The American people spoke in 2012. @SenatorBurr did not listen.
@SenatorBurr We have already had a say in 2012. You have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. I live in NC and I vote.
@SenatorBurr @MSNBC @FoxNews @CNN 
Will you ever break from your party's obstruction and full fill your responsibility as a NC Senator?
@SenatorBurr WHY ARE YOU THE WORST SENATOR EVER? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?
@SenatorBurr we had a say when we elected Pres Obama...twice.  Stop obstructing  the government you work for.
@SenatorBurr amen!
@SenatorBurr Yes we do. You're up for reelection inNov so stop voting til next year. Oh wait, you haven't worked since 1st elected to office
@SenatorBurr why on earth would we wait for nearly a year?
@SenatorBurr how long do you think it will be till the Repubs betray again. A little pretend opposition then submit. That's way the R's roll
.@SenatorBurr U r up for re-election? Do your job or lose your job. #WorstCongressEver
@SenatorBurr Since 1789, there have been 112 U.S. Supreme Court justices. And the American people have had a say in exactly zero of them.
@SenatorBurr Our President is @BarackObama and he should fill the current vacancy.
@SenatorBurr As one of your constituents, I demand you do YOUR constitutional duty and confirm the President's nominee.
@SenatorBurr do your job or step aside.
@SenatorBurr the "people" decided they elected the president #GOP must stop their childish tantrums & do their jobs & let president do his
@SenatorBurr the American people want our president to do his job. North Carolinians want YOU to do yours, too!
.@SenatorBurr thinks the 2016 election should count but 2008 & 2012 elections shouldn't. What a #hypocrite. He violated his oath of office.
@SenatorBurr wrong. Maybe u should read the Constitution
@SenatorBurr The American people HAD a say. Obama is President. Do your job.
@SenatorBurr This sort of argument is silly. Didn't the American people have a say when Obama was elected to a second term?
@SenatorBurr Your seething hatred of Obama doesn't change how government works, or what constitutional law is. It just doesn't.
@SenatorBurr Do you guys not even know how government works? Why are you in it? We the People chose Obama. TWICE.
@SenatorBurr The American People had a say. They elected, then RE-elected President Obama. YOUR dislike doesn't change that.
@SenatorBurr I had a say, I voted for the current president.
@SenatorBurr => Absolutely ridiculous comment.
@SenatorBurr we have had our say. We elected a President TWICE. You're despicable.
@SenatorBurr is that what your national spying apparatus tells you?
@SenatorBurr There is no basis for your refusing to consider proper nominations submitted by President Obama. Refusing to do so is unethical
@SenatorBurr the American people had a say. Now do your job.
I love how politicians love to talk about giving people a say and then gerrymander districts to eliminate that voice @NCLeg @SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr Fill it.
@SenatorBurr we had our say, in 2012. Make government work, the Senate needs to do its job and vet and appove a nominee.
@SenatorBurr The people had a say. They elected Obama twice!! It's his job. Do yours!
@SenatorBurr Sir,the American people have had a say, they voted for Obama. If you don't remember that, please seek medical attention.
The American people had a say in 2012. #SCOTUS is too important for a seat to stay empty for over a year. @senatorburr
As a constituent of his who is fond of the Constitution, I think @senatorburr should be ashamed of that inappropriate assertion.
Or did Reagan act improperly in nominating Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court? He was confirmed in '88. @senatorburr
.@SenatorBurr We did! POTUS term is 4 years, not 3. I might agree if it were November instead of February, but come on. This is ridiculous.
@SenatorBurr I guess you feel Mr Obama should only have 3/5 of a pesidential term
@SenatorBurr- I, along with over 61 million people had our say. Twice. He's President Obama and it's his duty to nominate someone. Do yours.
@SenatorBurr How dumb do you think the people of NC are? If it was a Repub prez, you would wait?! #SCOTUS #pathetic
@SenatorBurr I guess we know who is a leader and who is a follower https://mobile.twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/698666807167549440?s=04 … #DoYourJob
The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. #Scalia https://www.facebook.com/mitchmcconnell/posts/1021148581257166 …
@SenatorBurr Why do you hate the Constitution, Dick?
@SenatorBurr you have sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of these United States, which holds no provision for delay
@SenatorBurr Why R U so eager to undermine the U.S. Constitution? U seem quite self-serving.
@SenatorBurr The people had their say when they overwhelmingly elected President Obama. Now you are trying to deny them their say. #partisan
@SenatorBurr The only way this makes sense is you and rest of GOP see Obama as only 3/5 of a president, so think his term is already up?
@SenatorBurr The American people had their say in 2012.
@SenatorBurr we already had our say when 5 MILLION more of us voted for Obama than Romney... #DoYourJob
@SenatorBurr As a constituent, I'm extremely disappointed in this statement. You should be ashamed. Change your opinion & do your job.
@SenatorBurr I live in NC and vote. You sir are not representing me well. That is too long of a time to leave that seat vacant!
@SenatorBurr They already had their say and, as a result, we have a sitting president whose job it is to nominate Supreme Court justices.
@SenatorBurr cite legal precedence please.Americans will see for what it is, both obstructive and disingenuous.Will only hasten GOPs fall.
@SenatorBurr American people had say when they elected current president in 2012.That's  system. But let's teach kids sore losing AGAIN!
@SenatorBurr we had our say in '12. Do Your job!  #scotus
@SenatorBurr We had our say in 2012. Presidential terms are 4 years. This President is still President. Do your research & your job!
@SenatorBurr We DID say. And we're perfectly willing for @POTUS to fulfill his Constitutional duty. You might want to do the same.
@SenatorBurr All of the above!
. @SenatorBurr what about the millions of Americans who cast their ballots for President Obama?
@SenatorBurr this is the dumbest reason to neglect your senatorial duties. The people had their say in 2012 when they voted in POTUS again.
.@SenatorBurr The People had their say when they re-elected Barack Obama to serve another FOUR year term. Not three. You're out of line.
@SenatorBurr This current was elected, twice, therefore the American have had a say. Be better than this. Think for yourself.
.@SenatorBurr, if you will deny @POTUS a #SCOTUS vote, do you disagree with the guy who said this? #NCSen #NCPol
@SenatorBurr are you fully prepared to vote "NO" on any candidate, if it comes to that?
@SenatorBurr Please read Article II of the Constitution then put the needs of the people ahead of politics.
@SenatorBurr You just lost my 2016 vote.   You are an embarrassment by saying this before you even know who Obama will nominate.
.@SenatorBurr the American people voted in Obama+he still has 11 months of a presidency-he has every right 2 appoint a new #SCOTUS justice
@SenatorBurr so you're saying that congress shouldn't uphold the constitution?
@SenatorBurr Thought you were a smart, reasonable man until this! This is absolutely not in the letter or spirit of the constitution.
@SenatorBurr Well then I hope you stick up for that. Don't cave in.
@SenatorBurr wrong would you say that if a republican person was in the office now.#hypocrite #remove you from office.
@SenatorBurr Would you be saying the same if the White House was currently occupied by a Republican?
@SenatorBurr the American people do have a say and the POTUS they chose is obligated by the constitution to nominate a new justice
@SenatorBurr the American people chose the current president-twice. We expect the constitution to be upheld and a Justice to be put in place
.@SenatorBurr Can Mitch McConnell drink a glass of water while you say that?
@SenatorBurr As a democracy we voted in @BarackObama for 8 years, not 7- As a registered independent, I'm sorely disappointed in your post.
@SenatorBurr You're disgraceful, we elected Obama handily twice. Get over it, do your job just as he will do his.
@SenatorBurr seems like we had our say. Twice. Does your copy of the constitution read differently about nominations? Sick of all of you
@SenatorBurr your sense of entitlement and privilege is really showing. You only run to the constitution when it benefits your agenda.
@SenatorBurr we do have a say, as it is written in the Constitution. The current president shall continue his duties. Stop being a hater
@SenatorBurr we already had our say dick https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012 …
@SenatorBurr if it happened during W's term, you'd say 100% the opposite. Without hesitation.
@SenatorBurr bull. We had our say - twice - when we elected @POTUS, he should be the one to fill #SCOTUS seat.
@SenatorBurr Obama is so passive/aggressive disrespectful! Announcing something like that to the nation with no tie!
ummm. How about the 08 & '12 elections? Reminder to @SenatorBurr, the Constitution sets an EIGHT-year term. H/t @BlueDuPage
@SenatorBurr Did they not have their say when they elected the current President? Why should they wait for nearly a year?
@SenatorBurr Shut up.
@SenatorBurr where is this in the Constitution?
@SenatorBurr This NC Independent voter says your job & replace the late justice ASAP.  Otherwise, there is no way I will vote for you.
@SenatorBurr 1) thats crassly political 2) no precedent exists to keep a SC seat vacate because theres just one year left in a Prez term
@SenatorBurr that's almost a year. Doubtful you would ask the same if Pres was a republican.
@SenatorBurr I Agree!!!
.@senatorburr didn’t they have a say when they elected the, um, the current president?
@philgoodstory @SenatorBurr president chooses Senate confirms, nothing says they have to confirm anything
@SenatorBurr I'm sure you would say the same if a Republican held the White House - NOT
You'll oppose any nominee? Is it a question of if, @SenatorBurr, or which one? #NCSen
The American people deserve a say. The Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled until there is a new President.
@choosesam well done with the Ham reference
@SenatorBurr  Do you prefer Hillary or Bernie to choose the new SC Judge?
.@SenatorBurr 17 Supreme Court Justices confirmed by Senate during presidential election year. Do your job. #SCOTUS
@JustinConley @SenatorBurr don't listen to these liberals, they didn't vote you into office
.@SenatorBurr with all due respect, I think you're forgetting that they already have had their say. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2012 …
@SenatorBurr They had a say. The sitting president is not frozen in his last year - constitution- 101
@knightofgood @SenatorBurr .... exactly right, Wilhelm! ... :-)
