say "no" on Graham-Cassidy, this bill is horrific!
Deplorable Dick Spurr gets his ass handed to him by canadian drs. Uniformed, uneducated.
You should work on a bipartisan fix for the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Otherwise you're an empty suit.
Graham / Cassidy is a death sentence for many people in NC who are already struggling. Vote no.
$100,000 of Facebook ads versus the $1 billion Hilary spent on misinformation?
There's an awful rumor going around you want to take #healthcare away from millions of AMERICANS! Please don't harm + kill US for greed.

Hi, @SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis. This is Ted. He has something he'd like to say to you. Please watch. Please listen.

@SenatorBurr only cares about an Promise...doesn't matter the bill itself...it's only so @realDonaldTrump can say " I win"
Why do people bother telling you how much they don't like this stupid bill, that even top Republicans said is bad!
Trump Care is so bad, a top Republican admitted that the "only" reason y'all want this sick plan is a campaign promise!   Not the bill!
Great for NC! Now we need you to vote NO on Graham Cassidy bill and save the ppl w/preexisting conditions! #ReformACA

Any progress of getting rid of the ethanol mandate? 
So many Americans would benefit from the resulting drop in food prices.
Why bother speeding the FDA process if you're going to destroy healthcare so we can't get needed drugs anyway?
Yes, reforming the FDA while voting to repeal Obamacare. Come on Senator, just vote no.
Why won't you have hearings for Graham-Cassidy? Why take health insurance away from millions without so much as a single HEARING????
