These are the 54 senators who blocked the bill to prevent terrorists from buying guns http://on.nowth.is/1aw7

I would believe the CIA director over RadicalObamaism any day of the week.
If I refused to do my job, I would be fired. Stop acting like a bunch of whiny little brats & approve a Supreme Court justice
Stop worrying about who people love & marry & stop pandering to religious extremists! There, you have been chastised, get to work
Really Senators ???   God WILL make you pay.
@superlioness1 OBAMA sleeping while PUTIN takes control of Middle East & China S China sea.
 this is a wrong statement. But I'll play. This effects you how?
anything that effects the security of this nation, affects everyone in the USA
agreed, which is why we should have common sense gun reform. Forget guns getting out. Its the guns in.
You see my point. WH has open border. DRUGS, ILLEGALS & YES, WEAPONS CAN BE CARRIED ACROSS
immigration is vital to a strong economy. People worry about the wrong things. The media incites fear
proper immigration is great thing. I used to watch hundreds of illegals cross over border easily
Of course you lie and manipulate the reporting
THESE PEOPLE ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS

@SenateGOP
Do NOT betray US & cave post terror attack(s) & allow any barriers to citizens basic rights to carry to protect family & self.
If we put the guns in a Target bathroom would you actually then address the issue? #donothingcongress #enough
Sorry, I fear getting shot by violent men who feel sad and irrelevant more than fearing any religion. You are #donothingcongress
.@1CHOICE I will call out everyone up for reelection if they don't respect the people's votes I will SUPPORT anyone that respects

@SenateGOP
Two teens killed in Pine Hills shooting, deputies say
Obama can't stop from misleading Americans. Thank you Dir. Brennan for speaking up.
Obama is a pacifist who is living in a dream world of his own making.  We Americans will continue to suffer unnecessarily.
BO underplays threat of JV team ISIS and over sells his progress against ISIL. They!re heeere! Is there a CIA Op to reduce BO HRC
and the republican senate and house has given Barack Hussein Obama everything he's ever wanted.
@jsrroger This CLOWN is as bad as Baghdad Bob!
@SenateMajLdr You say the right things, but then you give Obama everything he wants. Why???? You speak with forked tongue.
.@SenateGOP ..a reprise..and so soon!..
@SenatorBurr working as hard as can to make sure are defeated you are stupid TRUMP and guns.
@MstoryMichelle 
obama lying always
@pspoole I'm with Director Brennan's assessment on this.
Looks like apples and oranges to me.
@SenatorBurr And now you want to comply with proposed gun control brought on by Democrats? Better vote "no".
He has no interest in foreign affairs.  All he wants to do is campaign to relive his glory days.
@twright55 when you endorsed a criminal tobeour president  nobody wants why are you shoving her down our throat
#guccifer2.0
@twright55 Get that son of a butch out of office then you will see that change in a hurry
@SenateMajLdr Next sentence> Even heavier losses. Terrorism capability is a laptop and intnet connection
Obama is a deceiver. And he endorsed killary
what another lie
@SenateMajLdr   Obama has been and is clueless
. @SenateGOP this is our sad #kneepadPOTUS psy-ops, pro-ISIS stance. #ImpeachObama
We now have open borders, and are being invaded & resettled. Your inaction is why Trump was elected.  WTF is wrong with you guys?
you realize "ranks and morale" and "capability and reach" are different words that mean different things, right?
@SenateMajLdr Obama LIES RIGHT TO OUR FACE. This proves hell say anything to protect his legacy. Generals confirm this is false!
Is Obama living in an alternate universe or is he truly just oblivious? Most houseplants are better informed than him!
And how much money do you collect in sum from the NRA? #Enough #gunreform #filibuster #Orlando #SandyHook #Aurora
Are u sorry u created ISIS yet? U built it, U own it!
@SenateMajLdr Is the IRS spying on tax return of ISIS mambers?
@SenateMajLdr They only needed a couple of guns to inflict great harm on US citizens. WH policies failed!
@SenateMajLdr Comparing apples and potatoes today, Senator. One does not exclude the other.
@SenateMajLdr . ISIS NAMES 3 US CITIES IN THREAT VIDEO. 
Obama’s success would contain the roots of his failure
 HE'S A WIPE OUT
is this president on drugs? Is he completely ignorant of the problem! No... He's just a blatant lier.
@SenateMajLdr I'm sure they got a morale boost after Orlando.
He lies so much if he told the truth, it would be a lie...
The best thing the Democrats have going for them now is dynamic duo of Trump and the GOP leadership. GOP - Get your head out!
Your party has done NOTHING to help, so...just STOP! #MakeItStop #Enough #OrlandoUnited
hahahahahhaa.... Good (Y) joke
HE ALSO SAID THEY WERE A JV TEAM AND THEY HAD BEEN CONTAINED AS THEIR NUMBERS GREW. WHAT A CLOWN OBAMA AND HILLARY MAKE.
Bullshit. GOP is comparing Obamas comments about ISIS' core in Syria/Iraq to CIA's coments about terrorism. 2 different topics.
oh really, POTUS?...Have you chit chatted with them recently?
Ash Carter says the same thing - that we aren't getting anywhere.
Obama is delusional & telling what he "believes" to be true about ISIS--but objective reality shows a much different set of facts
Are you rooting for ISIS? Or are you just rooting against the President? #fairweatherpatriotism
@FoxNews So, now I am convinced that Obama does not read the morning NSA reports....
Why is @BarackObama lying to America? @SenateGOP
blah blah blah
It's all smoke and mirrors.
sure thing you keep arming them!!
Intel meds!!
yea it's shrinking cause there bringing them over here
