Bad picture.. you look like a unicorn. BTW.... vote NO on #Trumpcare
"The People's house"? You are not representing the people. You are representing Trump and his family and friends. You are supporting lies.
Why won't you speak to your constituents in NC Burr?
Did you receive money from NRA and how does the money benefit North Carolina?
The "people's house"...how ironic, you will soon be voting to remove healthcare from millions of those "people".
Stop #trumpcare. It will kill millions of children elderly & disabled
Want to comment on @DonaldJTrumpJr Russian meeting?
The "people" 45 referred to who think it's ok to meet with a Russian spy?
@ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorLankford @realDonaldTrump @TGowdySC @DevinNunes @GOPoversight
Good idea to take some fresh air. See you had no comment re Jr. Soon there will be two camps- those acted and those that did not.
Hey, when are you gonna catch up with your constituents in your home state of North Carolina? #avoidancetactic
GOP you better do what the people hired you to do!! You have it all and you're blowing it! No excuses! Get rid of O'care now!!

The entire Republican Party is engaged in a massive coverup operation of a President engaged in Treason.

Pass it on.
Stand for your country first not #Trump/Russia
There is a unicorn horn coming out of your head. This is what you get for trying to strip health care from thousands of North Carolinians.
Not one word about Trump Jr? Not one word about a Town hall meeting?  We will not forget.
Vote NO on new Sentate GOP repeal of ACA health bill. Don't take health care away from millions of people. Over a million in NC.
Call today - Let your voice be heard. #VoteNo #Trumpcare

Great view of #treasonweasel why no results from YOUR committee? Every other INVESTIGATION is on 
Is that your ideal of a town hall you worthless Doucette.
You cannot align yourself with @RealDonad_Trump & win!
Keep the @WhiteHouse honest!
You need to put your COUNTRY Before Your PARTY Mr.Burr - You will NOT get reelected by supporting a TRAITOR 

@newsobserver @NBCNews @AP
We Care about Russian interference with Trump!
When will you investigate trump jr?  #LockHimUp
Who cares?  You won't even hold a town hall for crying out loud.
WHY don't you hold town hall meetings @SenatorBurr ??

Support usa and trump who corrupt politicians/news has been trying to overthrow like cnn. Or comey. Letting usa think trumps a russian agent

Wish that was a light bulb over your head instead of the Washington Mon. You're disgracing this country every min you let this BS continue.

So about healthcare, you know Trumpcare is bad for the people in this country and I know you'll do the right thing and vote no one Trumpcare
You support this? How much longer are you going to protect that poor, sick old man? Who is destroying my country, btw.
We cannot let this conman ruin our country! #Resistance
Still complicit. You are willing to trade lives for a tax cut for a few.

how about learning what constituents think of the awful Senate healthcare bill? #KillTheBill
Trump and Tillerson are meeting Putin alone.  They come bearing a list of "deliverables."  What are we going to do?
So when is your town hall meeting? Can't find it listed anywhere. Are you not having them because you're a lily-livered chickenshit?
Or is it because you want to do as you please and not represent your constituents?
He has been ignoring our needs, instead voting in lockstep w/trump. Party over country...
Are you releasing NCs personal data to proven election fraud strategist @KrisKobach1787?
Wondering when NC voters can talk to you at a Town Hall meeting? You have some time off right now.
Remember these constituents, too!!
U must vote against #trumpcare. 53% of NC is against! vote for people of NC n not 4 GOP Party. #Trumpcarekills
Ashamed of your support of a bill that could kick  a million plus NC residents off of healthcare. #HealthcareBill
Did you tell them how you'll vote on #TrumpCare ? I know you plan on voting NO!
Trump is delusional. Enough.
How about a #TownHall For constituents that can't travel to DC? Do you represent party or people?
Vote against AHCA please! Also, please acknowledge how unfit our POTUS is and do something about it. Don't be complicit. #25thAmendmentNow

BIGGEST NEWS!
Repeal Obamacare!!!!!!
Just curious....where do you purchase your health insurance?
@potus + @putinrf shouldn't meet. @gop @housegop @senateGOP @HouseDemocrats @senategop Don't let this happen! #impeach #trumprussia #treason
Agree with Sen Sasse. Repeal and Replace. Let's get it right!
Why is the US Senate and Congress allowing POTUS to meet with Putin while under investigation for collusion with him?
We sure could use some town hall meetings from you and Mr. Tillis.
Did u manage to stop by the White House & reprimand POTUS 4 his unmanly attempt at distracting us from email scandal.
You need to deny Trumps BS Voter info request and that redic health care bill. I no longer trust you.
Everybody's wearing white
Same. I sure would love to do some catching up at a town hall meeting where real people can be heard on real concerns.
Repeal and replace NOW! No more career politicians with broken campaign promises, term limits needed to clean out the swamp!
-you were transition team. GOP working to unde mine investigation, the abnormal vile Trump is still getting cover while we r attacked
Any word about trump's sexist comments? You need to speak and call him out, for all the woman in NC
Your silence is deafening, Sir. Every woman in NC is waiting for you to take action.

This was the view that greeted the rest of us this morning, @SenatorBurr. 
This is unpresidential behavior, and it spiraled downhill from there.
Come to North Carolina and talk to us.  You represent us, right...?
Did they ask you about Trumo's rude tweets  I"m sure you're "troubled " by them.  As Always. I'm more interested in what your wife thinks
You are judged by the company you keep.
I wonder how many of those constituents will lose health care thanks to you?
If only it was really the people's house . . .
You're going to VOTE NO on AHCA right? That's what they asked wasn't it?  Or were they chosen rich republicans who would get the best deal ?
Kill the Bill. Full repeal!
@ChuckGrassley @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorLankford  LIE! NOT 17 but ONLY 4.
Trump is trying to distract his base but the restciff know his tweets will not keep Trumpcare from failing.
NO Medicaid cuts. NO increased premiums. NO out-of-pocket max increases. NO tax reductions for the wealthy Vote NO on BCRA and FIX the ACA.
How about a town hall meeting?  Catch up with some constituents back home.
Great idea. Or a town hall on FB.
Senator Burr, please vote no on the healthcare bill.
How's that view of the way your boss talks about women? How is Mrs. Sessions today?
Please do not let your people in NC go without health insurance. They hurt enough already
Would be great if you had the guts to hold a town hall. Why are you still covering for Trump and Russia. Why do you want to harm so many
The GOP killed off Obamacare so the only option left would be the Tax Cut for the Super-Rich known as TrumpCare.  Heartless.
What do you think of Trump's unseemly behavior?  After this morning, if you don't condemn it, you are encouraging it.  Condemn it publicly!
Did you tell them how they're all going to lose their healthcare and that Russia owns us now?
Diverse group
Correct. The PEOPLE's house. Which it is only if you do what the people want. Vote NO on AHCA & fix the ACA & impeach Trump instead.
Richard Burr needs to Put Country First, get to the bottom of the Trump/Russia investigation.
When & where will you have an in-person town hall? Don’t be afraid, we don’t bite.
I'm a life long NC Republican who has lost faith the party.  I still hold a glimmer of hope in you. Don't let me down. #TrumpRussia
So ashamed of your continued support for GOP wealthcare bill and this fake president.
So Senator, how abut “catching up” with a few open town hall meetings during break & BEFORE Senate health care bill gets voted on?


You know what else is nice? Meeting with constituents at town halls in the beautiful state of NC.
Did you give them the 'Comey wink'?
I understand you're having problems with The Thing today. No, not your Volkswagen, I was referring to your buddy Trump. #CountryOverParty
How is the UNMASKING of AMERICANS investigation going?????? RICE? BRENNAN? McCabe???
Dummy it wouldn't be unmasked if the wasn't have many conversations with the USA adversaries!. Unmasking can happen everyday if need to be!.
Sen Burr, obviously ur not Senate Intel Chair by mistake: you've got what it takes. Continued  you "heard" concerns expressed yesterday. TY
Senator, do you condone what Trump said on twitter today regarding Mika?
The People's House is the @WhiteHouse and it's currently occupied by a mentally unstable person.

reminder: #Gorka is still a Nazi. #VichyGOP
We see you.
#shame for picking and choosing constituents to care about. #Unamerican
Protesters with disabilities stage a "die-in" over cuts to Medicaid outside of Sen. Mitch McConnell's office. 
vote no. vote NO
Not anymore
Time to demand this disgusting president resign. Please don't shrug this off..it is unacceptable
#shame

#AHCA WILL BE A KILLER.
#PUTIN IS A KILLER AS WELL...
This is how you treat the people, #shame on you @senatorBurr
Ten protesters outside of Sen. Toomey's office, several arrested: "Kill the bill, don't kill me." 
Aren't you going to speak out about the horrible example your party's POTUS is setting for our children? What happened to family values?
Trying to explain your upcoming YES vote on Trumpcare?
