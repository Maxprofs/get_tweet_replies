thank you for giving me another reason to get out a vote. Just casted my vote for @DeborahRossNC
why? You have already made your judgement and you want to put a bullseye on her. You are wats wrong with America not her.
You should be ashamed of yourself!! Shame on you!
Delete your account, step down & retire from public service. Jokes about assassination+promises for 4yrs of 8 on SCOTUS=unfit.
, it's ok to put a bullseye on your forehead Richard burr?
Shame on you. You can apologize all you want, but the fact you could even joke like that is disgraceful.
How did you even GET  on the Senate Intelligence committee?
someone thought it's a committee to gain intelligence. This guy certainly can't be part of any intelligent discussion
And let's see all yours. How many KKK letters fawning over you? How much money from white supremacists?
You should be investigate for threats to commit a crime. #FBI & Secret service
how's that #target audience? #campaignofhate #partyofhate #youreanasshat
You are unfit for public office. Resign.
and there should be a full investigation into your criminal threat against Clinton. You should be fired & charged. Disgusting.
undecided no more - you are unfit for office and don't deserve my vote https://www.google.com/amp/s/charlotteobserver.relaymedia.com/amp/opinion/editorials/article111886312.html?client=safari …
Amazing 1st Amendment protects even UR hateful speech. Ironic U head Senate INTELLIGENCE committee. Smart move GOP 
You want Secretary Clinton to be assassination by your "Second Amendment" people. How is this OK?
your hurting your own campaign by bringing up this email stuff.  I was a republican until the party nominated Trump.
Hey, why don't you get something done instead of trying to get rid of Clinton?  What have you actually done to benefit anyone?
shame on you
you should have also performed the job you were elected to do - 4000 days blocking a judicial appointment- made up my mind
And THEN shoot her? Or, as we say in Montana, was that just little-boy bluster?
yes and will you be standing with Trump at his trial for RAPE in December?
I see that the Apple hasn't fallen far from the tree. The disgrace of the name Burr well represented and perpetuated by you. 
do you have a bullseye on that?
you should resign
what process should be complete? SCOTUS nom?
you also asking for @realDonaldTrump 's tax returns??!! Shame on you!
Put a target on the server and shoot it!  Aren't you behind in the polls?
dude, get a life. You know these emails are irrelevant

& the @FBI AND @SecretService needs to look into your encouraging violence against a candidate 4 POTUS
Shameful a United States Senator tarnishes the office you are privileged to serve with references to violence.
you advocate shooting a Presidential Candidate. Shame on you a senior citizen with no moral compass.
Burr says "Trump ERASED thousands of Company Emails  but Trump is Trump"
of children. Karl Rove DESTROYED 22,000,000 BUSH White House emails, Bush/Cheney could not be tried for Crimes Against HUMANITY
VP Cheney admitted to GOP Fed Chairman Greenspan, BUSH invaded IRAQ to STEAL OIL. 1,200,000 DEAD(UK), including 100,000's
@GOP @Reince when is enough too much? Senator Suggests Shooting Clinton https://politicalwire.com/2016/10/31/gop-senator-suggests-shooting-clinton/ … via @politicalwire
The American people deserve a full SCOTUS, but you've said you'll block nominees because of your partisanship. #unamerican
we just found trump's russian server
will you promise to hold your breath for the duration of the "investigation"? #ImWithHer
Or else let's shoot her eh Senator Burr? Hope you lose. #ImWithHer
Just that Huma's husband is not in prison for under age Sex is Ridiculous. Now we know why California is Flooded W child sex Of
