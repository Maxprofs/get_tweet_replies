@SenatorBurr That would be nice, but the GOP doesn't seem to know how to do it! Even after all those video clips of the "stupid" Gruber!
@SenatorBurr @eagles1feather What Democrats say it's a train-wreck? It certainly wasn't the 11-million newly insured people.
@East_TN_News those numbers are pure BS and the majority who have it No Job or Poverty Level Taxpayers Paying @SenatorBurr @eagles1feather
Most common rebuttal is GOP has no plan to replace. They do & should pass bills even tho' O's veto is assured. @SenatorBurr @wildefyre116

@SenatorBurr @jimcc66 Sadly, it's #Boehner & #McConnell who r the problems. Big business likes #Obamacare, so Repub leadership keeps it.

@SenatorBurr @BettinaVLA Saving employer-based health insurance is vital and should be a GOP platform issue.
@SenatorBurr @3Quarters2Day ..Yet Sen Burr made no effort to stop Obama and his policies. It is disgusting to see these gutless Republicans.
@SenatorBurr @pc_backup1 Damn.  Give#nit a rest.  Repeating the same tired talking points is ur idea of leading!
@SenatorBurr people need t stop liking to government for help. People are in charge.
@SenatorBurr @PatriotPlaceATX #FullRepeal  let system fix itself.
@SenatorBurr @se_george I've been hard on our Senator, but I do agree completely that Obamacare has to be completely repealed!
@DixieHIGHHORSE @SenatorBurr @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee If they won't get rid of Obamacare, we need to get rid of them.  #ObamaDisaster
@SenatorBurr So good to have my Senator speak for the people. For every 1 signed up 2 have lost own insurance. @PattieCurran
@sunbeltgirl @SenatorBurr Burr doesn't give a crap about the people. his staffer walked out on a meeting in DC over Obamacare.

@SenatorBurr I am tired of my property tax being jacked up to pay public hospital bills of the uninsured. Show me a fix for that Senator.
@SenatorBurr You childish people have wasted $82-million dollars of tax-payer money trying to repeal Obamacare. zzzzzzzzzzzzz u lost 54X!
@SenatorBurr Obamacare passed 6 years ago and you're stilling running a campaign on stopping it. Utterly pathetic.
@SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr What was a train-wreck was your continuously gouging insurance buddies dumping people the minute they were diagnosed w/cancer.
@SenatorBurr - Stop with the rhetoric and let's work on 2.0. Build on good and adjust bad. Repeal=zero value.

@SenatorBurr What would full repeal do to those who have purchased insurance on the exchange?
@SenatorBurr #PJNET thanks you for supporting the grassroots as we work together for #FullRepeal
@SenatorBurr I try to remind folks about the coding and complex IT systems w/Heatlhcare.Gov-so with changes we have more code involved
@SenatorBurr With #SCOTUS decision too, it's more than just verbiage-there's algorithms attached-that we react wtih http://bit.ly/10IHtMV 
@SenatorBurr It's hard right now-both parties to make changes w/#Obamacare-reality: "the machines" run the #ACA http://bit.ly/1qGTaun 
@SenatorBurr And then what? How are you going to address the 30%+ administrative waste in healthcare? The high costs? What's the solution?
@SenatorBurr not unless you have a better plan! #AffordableCareAct works!
@SenatorBurr please!We pay over $700/mnth for a piece of Crap policy we can barely use.its awful.1st product ever bought that i cn't return
@SenatorBurr full repeal? Seriously? Turn Americans over to the mercy of insurance companies?
@SenatorBurr  How does the party plan to balance repeal vs already enrolled? Is the mgs repeal at the cost of the people already covered ?
@SenatorBurr.... Defund, repeal, and replace already!
@SenatorBurr I get that this is social media, but it's partisan, pandering, trash.  I hoped for better from my representative.
