Cool. Hey, by the way, could you maybe stop trying to make it easier for insurance companies to kick my daughter off our policy? Thanks!
I know this kid! She rocks, let me tell you. The world would be an infinitely worse place without her.
I'm a big fan of her. Did you catch her segment this summer on @npratc?
No! But I will... you know about my action writing, right?
Do tell!
When will you open an investigation into Samantha Powers 260+ unmasking? Obama admin politicized intelligence agencies. Unlawful. @LouDobbs
Please DO NOT vote for the Graham Cassidy fiasco.   Remember Gov McCrory. The Koch Bros. money might not get you reelected.
@ChuckGrassley @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @TGowdySC @DevinNunes 

Clapper, Brennan & Comey are GUILTY.

Obama, Lynch, Hillary are too
This is what we will remember about the Eastern District of NC seat:
@ChuckGrassley @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @TGowdySC @DevinNunes 

Why is it that the DEMS keep getting away with crimes?

Enough
The MSM doesn't report their wrongdoings just what republicans do.
This is  the best  for NC?  I guess so if you're hell bent on vote supression. #ProtectOurVotes #VoterID  http://www.charlotteobserver.com/article174539786.html …
Agreed. Just as his racist record disqualified Sessions from the bench then (and shd have dq'd him from AG now) it disqualifies Farr.
1- WHY aren't we having hearings about Graham-Cassidy? Are trying to hide the FACT that you are voting away health insurance from
2- millions of people. Especially those who have pre-existing conditions? Is this what we have come to expect from the GOP?
3- Too afraid to face your constituents? How can you vote for something that we don't know anything about?
4-Is the GOP the Party of secrecy while they take away our ability to be insured? We will remember this.

Grassley admitted it's a bad bill that's being considered just to give GOP a "win." Ya think the Framers thought Congress was in that biz?
@ChuckGrassley @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @TGowdySC @DevinNunes 

CLAPPER is a LIAR! Get him indicted!
Please vote NO to the Graham Cassidy healthcare bill. We must move forward on universal coverage. Get the insurance lobbies out of the way.
NOOOO HE's RACIST “@SenatorBurr: Thomas Farr for U.S. District Judge Eastern District of North Carolina in the… https://twitter.com/i/web/status/910524256148164609 …”
Nice!
.@NCGOP proud 2 support @realDonaldTrump nomination of Tom Farr to the Federal Bench. Also was nominated by @GeorgeWBush__ Farr-= great man
The fact you are endorsing him tells me all I need to know. Horrible choice for NC. With a losing record in court to boot.
“The most important thing is:Tom Farr is a good man,” Burr said.Not true! His history with voting rights&intimidation are. Disappointed!
What a sale out you are
why?
Please vote no on the healthcare bill. We need insurance for everyone. Every modern civilized nation has healthcare. The US is behind here.
Vote No to the repeal of the ACA.
This man defends racist gerrymandering.  Unfit. Shame on you.
Are you also voting to kill millions of Americans?
Answer the question!

Homeland Security says Russian hackers targeted Wisconsin's voter registration system http://bit.ly/2ffRsD9  
I hope you are met w the same response w which you treated President Obama's appointments 
Not interested in ANYTHING nor ANYONE you introduce. Can't wait until you're out of office. #disgracetoNC
Now introduce an IG for Mueller and 16 Clinton Obama attorneys. Overreach gone wild. Shows @TheJusticeDept @FBI is beyond DEEP STATE
You vote TrumpCare2 = No Mental Health Care = No Hope. Karma's Kitchen only serve what you put on menu. #NoGrahamCassidy #BloodOnYourHands
How long have you been holding this position open?
Hopefully he is a republican
So your office tells me you're supporting Graham-Cassidy. Thanks for attempting to destroy the lives of your constituents for a payout.
Senator... counting on you  If Sept 30th comes and goes and you don't put in a healthcare plan; it's toast! You'll never get 60 votes.
Senator .... you need to get McCain, Murkowski to VOTE yes on healthcare bill! Those two in cahoots. Just get it through and then makeChange
Oh so a brazenly political nomination? Like you falsely accused Obama of doing?
U have just shown world what a truly terrible man u really r by nominating Farr. Farr is a despicable man & u r his twin! Cc @SenateDems
Why do you support a racist?  This person should be no where near a federal bench.
KILL the #GrahamCassidyBill  Senator BURR.  My LIFE depends upon it!  #KillTheBill #MAGA by killing #GrahamCassidyBill . #WednesdayWisdom
KILL the #GrahamCassidyBill  Senator Tillis.  My LIFE depends upon it!  #KillTheBill #MAGA by killing #GrahamCassidyBill . #WednesdayWisdom
Get it done!
He supports racial discrimination and voter suppression in our state. Completely unacceptable.
Trump judicial nominee defended NC voter suppression law that targeted black voters "with almost surgical precision" https://medium.com/@vanitaguptaCR/farrs-nomination-is-trump-s-newest-attack-on-the-right-to-vote-54849aea7f6d …
Today your constituents live in fear of a life without healthcare. Do your job and represent North Carolinians & vote no on #GrahamCassidy
You introduce him before or after you tried again to ruin healthcare for needy Americans? Shame on you tea bagging hypocrites
Vote no on GOP deathcare.

Save ACA!
