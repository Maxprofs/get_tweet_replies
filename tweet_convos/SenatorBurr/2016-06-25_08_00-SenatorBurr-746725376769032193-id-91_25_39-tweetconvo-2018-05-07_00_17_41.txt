maybe no fly no buy? Oh it's the NRA always gets it way with blood to pay.
U realize even ACLU and CAIR say no to No Fly No Buy?
since when does the GOP care what they say? Fix the fly list problems at he same time. Oh right doing nothing is much better
how do you fix a list which is Secret & public is unable 2B told anything about why a name is on it?
it's called changing the law, we send people to Washington to do it.
yeah so how do you fix the list? What law do U think would do that as Dems have certainly not put one forth.
like the dems can pass anything in congress right now. NRA owns the GOP
they have not presented a bill. I asked what law would U suggest? How R U going ot change secret list?
@SpeakerRyan Okay Mitch! Then, lead the charge to kill ISIS over there! 
Our biggest threat is Obamas Ruthless regard for our Constitution. Next our GOP leaders who refuse to stop Him
@YouTube countries in that region must take the lead. They live there we don't!!
Known fact this government is funding & arming #ISIS to come after Americans rights http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/15/memo-received-by-clinton-obama-admin-aided-group-that-became-isis-to-control-area-where-isis-formed-caliphate/ â€¦
Support and join President Donald Trump 100% now TO TAKE BACK AMERICA AND CHANGE EVERYTHING. NO MOREDELAYS&WasteofTime. VDT
Since you still don't understand the reason for the rise of Trump, let me enlighten you: The GOP voters HATE you!
There is no other option. Defeat & destroy.
you are the embodiment of everything that is bad about obstructionist politics as usual.
.My constituents are more concerned with domestic rather than foreign.terrorism. Follow me www.@.cohd19.org.
why won't you answer whether you think Trump is qualified?
FAIR WARNING: If you & the GOP cause Donald Trump to lose the election, the Republican Party will cease to exist.
How do you plan to stop #91LivesTakenDaily by gun violence May have to break from @NRA #DisarmHate #Orlando
@YouTube otherwise the terrorists will bleed into their  countries and continue the fight
THE WAY TO HELP DEFEAT ISIS IS TO PROMOTE WE THE PEOPLES CHOICE TRUMP. A VOTE AGAINST HIM IS A VOTE FOR ISIS
Show us the way ! I served in 69 to 72 and you guys deny me my right to benefits ! Yet give countries Billions , WTF
The first thing is to call what it is. Radical Islamic terrorism. Come to my town I can show where it starts.
@YouTube big talk but no action.
And gun laws that keep assault weapons off the market. Mass killings USA not NRA.
@YouTube or maybe to form a better relationship with American Muslims.
@YouTube #ISIS TRUMPSUPPORTER
then do your job and quit stalling. #NoBillNoBreak
Useless as usual. Thanks for the useless advice. We need to monitor our mosques here. Ferret out the Islamists.
im more interested in et alien ufo disclosure are the politicians going to continue to deceive the public
regarding their presence?
you know Trump is not qualified.  Refusing to say anything shows you value party over country, and are nothing but a pimp
@YouTube agree so very much with that statement.
@YouTube ....what a great plan
is to wipe them off the face of the earth-
@YouTube another way to prevent attacks would be to have #backgroundcheks  #NRAPUPPET
#worthlessmcconnell
AMEN. WHY DOESNT THE SENATE TAKE SOME ACTION INSTEAD OF WATCHING AND DOING NOTHING
And CLOSE the border and visa loopholes. Dumb, just plain dumb not to do so.
NO you are wrong. Resign!
Mitchie, you just have blood lust in your heart, don't you?
@shirlmercy @SenatorBurr Then stop the refugees!  You're allowing refugees to be placed throughout this country STOP IT!
I think that was the GOP mantra 10 years ago. #NoNewIdeas
Are you 2 drunk now ISIS can buy a gun
You can't kill hateful ideas by killing a bunch of people in another country. Lack of logic astounds me.
As long as there are no boots on the ground. No troops in the Middle East ever again!
@YouTube Good God Burr won't even be in office come November,  not even you pushing his drivel!
or get rid of safe zones and allow Americans the ability to fight back retard
no. It is to prevent them from getting guns here. You're thinking of how to kill US service men and women.
Might help but our problem is lone wolfs & US citizens hate groups!
Yeah, kill even MORE innocent people.  That will make everyone love US.  #DUMBASSES
@YouTube ISIS must be defeated wherever it is identified. Especially on our soil at our borders. Build the wall.
where can I read your plan on how to handle isis?
or leave the terrorists in Syria - temporary ban on Muslim immigration into our country!!!!
Or maybe Bush and Cheney shouldn't have gotten us into a protracted ground war that helped create ISIS.
.YOU GO FIRST #GOPSCUM! & NONE OF US WILL FOLLOW CAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE! KILLS 2 BIRDS!
How does bombing people in foreign countries stop radicalization of US citizens? Let's stop with Islamaphobia.
thank you Captain Obvious! It's good to know someone says out loud as an announcement what everyone already knows
Nope. That has little to do with US citizens being inspired. We could kill em all in Iraq and Syria w no effect
NRA whore sees ISIS as big problem in US.  Blind t Orlando, Newton, etc etc.  #DoYourJob #NRAwhore
How to defeat ISIS?  Start by fully supporting Donald Trump.
Then why is @GOP e determined to import them? Your words mean nothing.  @SpeakerRyan
The best way to prevent #ISIS inspired attacks is to elect Democrats who are capable of actually governing
ISIS is the current name, but Muslim theology has been in the Dark Ages since its inception. Immigration control.
Dah! You smmmart  Did you just get up from your nap? Where U been for the last 7 years
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
Do u stand with 70+% of Americans who support bg checks Or do you stand with NRA & terrorist? #RememberInNovember
N. Korea is threatening the US with nuclear weapons. Isn't this a bigger threat?
Prayers for Democrats to take over in Nov and the US to be rid of GOP maj
That is some very poor logic.  Start with #CommonSenseGunLaws #NoFlyNoBuy
And Keep and Bare Arms!
YOU ARE UNCONSCIONABLE! SHAME ON YOU!
- stop suspected terrorists from getting GUNS!  #DisarmHate
Let's see the senate do its part. Thanks to your hate-filled leadership the Senate has lost its ability to govern
Say the do-nothing wholly-owned NRA lap dogs. #DisarmHate #DoYourJob
no kissing leave $$ on dresser @NRA  
Then stop talking declare war on Isis,all American's here is political parties talking no action. We are watching
The principal way to prevent attacks in America is to defeat the GOP and NRA @SenatorBurr
It's going to take a long time to defeat ISIS. But the American Taliban is backed by the #NRAownedGOP.
or to defeat the Republican Party
One way to prevent #ISIS inspired attacks in America is to not let terrorists/suspected terrorists buy guns
- we've been fighting that war since 2001-
- same war- u guys just keep changing the name for it-
And perhaps a Universal background check in guns? What are you so afraid of? #NRAownedGOP #makeitstop
