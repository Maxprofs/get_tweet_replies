not much of a turn out(to be expected)but great to see @SenatorBurr leading conservatives in recognizing the importance of #savelwcf .
If this was important to you, tell me, did you vote for Pruitt to head the EPA?
Hey Burr, why you lying about Christopher Steele?  Got something to hide from the Trump Transition Team?
#TrumpRussia #WhatsBurrHiding

The sources dispute characterization Burr gave on Wednesday about committee's contact with Steele. 
41 paid for the damn thing so quit trying to throw shade on it.
Too bad its just #Photoshoot , U don't care what #dukeenergy did to NC why the hell would you care about anyone else. #GreedWillKillU
Great now do your job and save your reputation by finding the obstruction to justice and collusion w Russia that Trump Fuhrer has engaged in
The British agent Steele is not going to answer your request to fly to USA! Why should he? So he could be killed by Trumps Russian mafioso?
Why would Steele do your bidding senator? Especially when he knows how incompetent and inept your leadership of senate Intel has been so far
Senator Burr, please support our  President. Investigate Clinton. I voted for you only because of him.
Thank you, sir, for your support of this cause! I hope this means that if needed you will vote to protect the #AntiquitiesAct and the #ANWR!
Thank you @senatorburr for your continued support of #lwcf and #conservation in #nc.
Planned @PPact does Cancer screenings + is the only care many women have! GOP cuts $500mil from #Medicare $1.5 trillion from #Medicaid SICK!
A good start.
Good, now advocate for American lives and help with sensible gun regulation.

How about advocating for common sense gun control? Do your constituents know you've been bought and paid for by the NRA? They should!

BREAKING: Associate of Steele tells #Maddow that Steele said yes to Senate Intel meeting request. 
You can fool some of the people some of the time...
We're not relying on politicians for anything. All of you are a mess. That's why we have Mueller
So, are you going to advocate for #actualscientists to advise on how to best conserve our environment?
@SenatorBurr it's obvious to the American ppl that you don't want it to come out about Trump/Russia collusion! Shame on you! #ShadyCoward
Steele said he'd be happy to meet... so why are you lying???????
@senateGOP budget document=cuts Medicaid -$1 trillion, Medicare -$473 billion #heathcare is a human right! REAL live children matter #CHIP
Does this mean you will ask @EPAScottPruitt to resign?
So you got caught lying ?
Burr  Receiving $$$$ from gun lobbists....Richard Burr$124,550 Republican North Carolina,
Apparently, burr, so eager to drop the investigation, lied yesterday
More on that @maddow scoop: Trump dossier author Christopher Steele is in talks with the Senate Intel Committee. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-dossier-author-talks-senate-intel-committee-n808401 …
@potus furious-Tillerson #TrumpisaMORON http://nbcnews.to/2xYyRUB   WE're furious @GOP cuts #Medicare $487 BILLION + $1.5 TRILLION to Mediciad
U better fire Ron Zinke then!
Oh you are also getting paid by democrats to push climate change crap..Disgrace

BREAKING: Associate of Steele tells #Maddow that Steele said yes to Senate Intel meeting request. 
You're not trying to find the truth of the Steele Dossier, you don't want to know the truth, the truth will convict your buddy, Trump.
C.Steel is ready to talk to you.. why are you lying?who do you cover?
And yet pretty sure you confirmed Pruitt, who is out to destroy water and exploit land
We (us the little folks) follow your tweets and none of us even know what you're talking about? Sounds like another kickback to the donors!
Hope you got permission from Warner.
budget document shows Senate R's are voting to cut Medicaid by 1 trillion, Medicare by 473 billion #heathcare is a human right!
There should be no time spent excoriating the Press until Trump is held accountable for his lies since his campaign started
Two quick questions: 1. Why are you threatening the press over Russia reporting? 2. Who in the hell do you think you are?
Thank you!
This is great @SenatorBurr now please explain your position on oil exploration in Arctic Wildlf Refuge and steps in NC to protect our water.
I'm surprised you found the time! Your fake Russia investigation seems to be taking up all your time.
Burr is obviously getting close! Russian bots are out in force.
Ur a Russian bot? I'm not
It's hard to tell based on your behavior. Putin sends his thanks & best regards. He thx u for promoting his agenda. 
Sounds like you and Putin are close! Everyone knows Dems are the ones with the real Russia ties. Isn't that right @MarkWarner?
Theres a reason the poorly educated are revered. Be careful you aren't conned. You'll likely regret it sooner than later. Be careful!
Did that make sense in your poorly educated brain?! 
Good luck to you. Be careful. The Russians are preying on you. Don't fall for it & unknowingly become a traitor.
Advocate for clean water , against Trump's EO allowing coal waste into our fresh water streams & rivers .
.
STOP ACTING LIKE A WUSS SENATOR!

ACT LIKE A MAN WHO CHAIRS HIS COMMITTEE, NOT A PANSY TO THE DEMOCRATS & WARNER.  YOU ARE TOO WEAK !
Stop taking money  from NRA
Why?
You're pandering to Trump's tantrums again Why Not make at least a "half-assed" attempt to appear impartial Mr. Investigator #FakeMyASS #POS
Yet you have said nothing about Trump ending environmental protections.  Hypocrite much?  #VoteBurrOut
And p.s., this post is a joke. Please clean up your own backyard first and take on @DukeEnergy - your constituents deserve clean water too
Can you AT LEAST join other Republican members of Congress in efforts to ban the sale of bump-fire stocks? #CommonSense
Too bad the man you support doesn't believe in climate change
So does this mean you're taking on Duke for passing on their cleanup costs to customers? #Hypocrite
Hypocrisy.
How about advocating for private property rights and abolishing EPA?
How about ADVOCATING  for LOWER HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS??!!!!
Still nausious from the pointless presser about russia probe! We know they interfere in elections. Still no reason for harassing Potus!
The hypocrisy continues in the corrupt GOP https://www.emptywheel.net/2017/10/05/richard-burr-accuses-the-obama-administration-of-running-out-the-clock-on-election-interference/ …
Sen. Burr, you're 2nd on this list. What do you have to say about #guncontrol?
Is this a joke? Do you think we're stupid?
Didn't you vote "yes" for Rick Perry's nomination? 
You are a hypocrite. (Look the word up.)
How about advocating for those who elected you? Say your oath of office out loud until you understand the concept.
Russian Dossier is a fake creative fictional document created by a known smear firm FusionGPS sir with all due respect how can u not C this?
I wonder who Burr thinks support his RINOISM. A Senator that has no support get primaried by real conservatives
Would really appreciate your work on DuPont/Chemours. Wilmington still does not have safe drinking water!
Great. Now advocate for fair elections and INVESTIGATE Trump and the Russian connection. Now. Advocate for humans while you're at it.
Burr's pandering to Trump's accusation of Fake News without a SHRED of evidence Just Trump's word which is WORTHLESS #TrumpsWordsNotGOSPEL
Love when big oil conservatives pretend to care about the environment.
I see you're colluding with the Russians. The Russians want to secretly take over our National Parks. The @SenateGOP is stuck on stupid.
Your one sick Senator allowing this hoax of a investigation to go on. Yet you revise the obvious lawless HRC, Comey, FBI, IRS to slide, SICK
North Carolinians still need clean drinking water, thanks to Duke Energy’s coal ash. Wanna advicate for them, maybe?
are you advocating as hard for clean drinking water in your own state or is this just a PR ploy?
That would be a huge "no" - this is a photo op. Burr is a party before constituents/ethics kinda guy.
Use all that money being wasted on the ignorant Russia collusion investigation
Rational Gun Laws Now
How about you worry about people in your state that doesn't have decent drinking water due to Duke Energy
