@AuberHirsch @SenatorBurr @USATODAY Nope. You unfortunately don’t understand technology or privacy. The FBI’s request is an outrageous joke.
@AuberHirsch @USATODAY Laws like this make us less safe, and help usher in an Orwellian dystopia ruled by the NSA & FBI. Cf. Patriot Act.
@AuberHirsch @USATODAY No, Apple would have to create new software to circumvent the erase feature, and that tool would inevitably leak out.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY  there is no precedent of a company being forced to design and create things as an arm of law enforcement.
@SenatorBurr You should not be threatening Apple.  I am a conservative republican that votes for you but disagree with your stance on this.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY 
A suggested read: http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment4.html 
.@SenatorBurr The government is pretty bad at protecting its data. Hence the OPM hack. A backdoor for the FBI is a global backdoor. 2/2
@shayfrendt @jfk117 @SenatorBurr Apple will hold technology, just open ONE phone as locksmith does one safe. Gov't won't have access.
@CHURCHLADY320 @shayfrendt @SenatorBurr Not under the FBI proposal. That's what happened in the past. FBI wants a back door in all iOS
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY The FBI has the phone, so they can do the work themselves.  Do not compromise product security.  I strongly oppose.
@senatorburr You may want to go read your constitution.
@SenatorBurr Scalia, applicable to Apple: "the Constitution insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all."
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY This is a shame to hear you say, companies should only be forced to hand information in their possession
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY the burden of proof, breaking into a safe, or hacking a computer should be on law enforcement. Not private companies
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Senators should stand for limited government and never expense liberties for the sake of safety.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY That's now how it works, Senator. That's not how any of this works. You're poorly staffed.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Sorry, not at the expense of our privacy.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY The  #Constitution should be above all! Not the oppressive fed that causes violence against us in the first place.
If you're an NC citizen that cares about privacy and national security you should write and let @SenatorBurr know you disagree.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY This is merely a way for the FBI to get a free tool to use elsewhere.  The slippery slope here is very slick.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY We will not be scared into losing our privacy rights again. The American people will not fall for this anymore.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Are you also going to criminalize companies that make paper shredders? That's what you're advocating here.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY You say that the government isn't asking Apple to create a backdoor, but that is exactly what they're asking for.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY It would behoove you to understand technology before you take such a stand #PoliticalIgnoranceIsNotBliss
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Constituent here. Thanks for protecting my privacy! I hope no one takes your phone and steals all your info!
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Hammers and screwdrivers are used to kill people. Senator, please introduce legislation to outlaw these weapons ASAP!
@SenatorBurr Your idiotic concept of liberty is damning. Police can easily bust in people's doors any time but CAN'T BECAUSE BILL OF RIGHTS.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY If Apple's encryption is a problem, are you also holding accountable the gun manufacturers and gun sellers?
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY  Let us knw whn you lrn the absolute basics of encryption. Until then you can stop your blatantly obvious propaganda.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY The problem is terrorists' access to GUNS, not access to PHONES. Isn't the 1st more important than 2nd amendment?
@SenatorBurr "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." Ben F.
@SenatorBurr May the deepest degree of shame rest upon your shoulders for calling on a company to undermine our privacy. Shame on you sir.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY The law should not be above the law-Law enforcement & FBI/CIA should be required to use iOS if they force back door.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY  You are DEAD wrong on this and Apple should fight it. Where is the outrage from the GOP with mass shootings?
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY YOU should be respecting the law. They are not obligated to help the FBI do their jobs. This is Un-American of you.
@SenatorBurr You are clearly suffering from cognitive dissonance when you say this and also talk about the limited scope of Govt.
@SenatorBurr If you truly believed in a limited Govt, rights of the people, due process & the BOR you'd be applauding Apple.
@SenatorBurr So you better unfuck yourself real quick before this bites your ass, which it will and rightly so. Do the right thing Senator.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY @Apple is providing security vs @FBI demanding holes.  Haven't enough cyberattacks shown how vulnerable US are?
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Your ignorance is shameful. The FBI's ask is harmful for national security, and you don't even realize why.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY There are startling and dangerous inaccuracies in your understanding of this case.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Govt Hacks! Having a private company create a backdoor into the phone will only help the hacker of the world!
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Wrong, Apple tried to provide the data from this fone. FBI turned them down cause FBI wants to access ALL Apple fones
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY
@SenatorBurr You sir are an idiot! Once the OS is cracked it could be applied to any iOS phone.I look forward to seeing what's on your phone
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY congrats on learning how to lose your next election
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Truly sad that an elected official would damage what America stands for and a great American company just to showboat
.@senatorburr .@usatoday Senator Burr, you have no idea how encryption works. You have no business making demands on how it should.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY if we hadn't let the woman into the country we wouldn't have the phone issue and the loss of freedoms
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Remind me again why a county gov is giving iphones to employees?  Or why *it* didn't escrow keys?  MDM?
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY So you want to strengthen your power to compel private co's and ppl's work to cover gov extravagance and ineptitude?
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY you are wrong in your stance on this issue & Apple is, in this case, doing the right thing for all of us,,,
@SenatorBurr and the government shouldn't be listening to everything it's people say. Fuck you. You ignorant asshole.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY  you are a piece of shit
Admit the real truth behind your motives. 
http://time.com/4229601/real-reason-apple-is-fighting-the-fbi/ …
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY 
.@SenatorBurr Just tweeting nonsense without actually understanding what the people want. We are all on Apple's side, not yours. Sad...
@SenatorBurr Are you sure someone has not been messy with your meds in the old folks home.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Neither should the Senate asking Apple to put a back door in their products is asking for trouble. @Apple @tim_cook
@SenatorBurr This Republican does not trust you or the government to strike the right balance. (2/2)
Apparently, @SenatorBurr hasn't heard of the Constitution. You know, that document which bans the creation of ex post facto laws? Google it.
@SenatorBurr Government-mandated vulnerabilities are not a solution to anything; and they would become a problem for everyone. (1/2)
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY You have an insufficient knowledge of computing to comment on such matters, not to mention legislate them
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY  Giving authorities tools such as software and back-doors is way beyond the scope of the order. SCOTUS will agree
@SenatorBurr I would expect a Wake Forest grad would have more intelligent thought than this.
.@SenatorBurr Enabling the FBI to brute force iOS password protection is creating a backdoor. 1/2
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Shame on you. Just another big-government thug.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY 'compliance of a lawful order' does not mean the ends justify the means. You're ordering blatant privacy violation.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY Sen Burr is completely incorrect. Civil rights are worth far more than terrorists. Ruin encryption=terrorists win.
@SenatorBurr You are wrong about this.  Please read the opinions of technology and privacy experts before you proceed.
@SenatorBurr Maybe you should educate yourself before speaking about a subject you obviously know nothing about. Great way to loose votes!
@senatorburr @usatoday Neither should you be above the law. Its obvious you don’t understand whats at stake.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY it's opinions like this which are why you will have a primary challenge-Constitutionalists unite for Brannon
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY ay bro, i thought you conservative types were for smaller government? this seems like uhhh... the opposite of that.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY You cannot be serious. This is the opposite of conservatism.
@SenateMajLdr, @SenatorBurr should be removed from chairmanship for political tone-deafness, stupidity, and assaulting the constitution.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY they are not above the law and have been working with law enforcement. do your homework
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY I firmly disagree with your op-ed and proposal forcing companies like Apple to break secure encryption. #AppleVsFBI
@SenatorBurr Big government and big brother ... what a great campaign slogan. I hope your constituents reward your treachery.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY You realize criminal will then use secure phones right ? Only regular citizens will be hackable. So what's the point?
@SenatorBurr Senator,we are America.We have a constitution to live by.As much as I dislike it, I agree with Apple. Live by our Constitution!
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY  Then PASS a law that applies! Don't use some outdated BS from the 1700's Also this wouldn't stop criminals #getaclue
.@SenatorBurr Also, that Constitution you supposedly love? I recommend reading it again soon. And yes, the Bill of Rights is part of it.
.@SenatorBurr I do wish you would understand the issues instead of reacting to headlines. There's no fucking way backdoors boost security.
@SenatorBurr to say I am disappointed in you would be an understatement.
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY- I whole heartedly believe you are way off base, Senator. A private company hs a duty to provide info sec to its cust
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY- private citizens shld be afforded as much privacy as the law states as well as Sec Clinton gets. U shld b hnting her
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY youve had info on him for 2-3-4years and we are just know watching his records I think we should already have been
@SenatorBurr @USATODAY what about the coastline of NC senator Burr?? We are in the ocean! 42 yrs of nothing..
