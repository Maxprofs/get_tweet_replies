Reconsider vote for DeVos. Her stance on privatizing public schools & pushing charters won't help kids that CAN'T AFFORD EITHER
BetsyDeVos is wholly unqualified for any position related to education. Our children deserve better.
Remember U won by < 6% of the vote. If U approve @BetsyDeVos U will lose by morenext time around. U work 4 us, not ur wallet
SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED!!!
She is unqualified.  Aren't our children more important than partisan politics? #StopDeVos
the people of North Carolina have respectfully asked that you vote no for Betsy DeVos.
I urge you to oppose DeVos as Secy ofEd. Her proposed changes to curricula would set US  behind other countries.
Of course you are.  Because  @BetsyDeVos bought your vote.
Shame on you. Pathetic
how you can possibly believe this to be the case? Vote NO Don't sell your soul to this administration
Recuse yourself from any vote. U have received donations from her and family. Doesn't look good & we are watching.
She is supremely unqualified for the job.  Wise up.  We deserve better.
#StopSessions #StopDeVos
you should be ashamed of yourself, confirming an OBVIOUSLY unqualified candidate just because she contributed to your campaign #NoShame
Reconsider! She couldn't answer simple questions about basic education tenants!
She bought you admit it. $$ we know everything @SenatorBurr @GOPHELP @BetsyDeVos
Sad that a US Senator can be bought
@GOPHELP @BetsyDeVos Shame on you...
As an NC native and one who works in education, I am appalled at your support of a woman who is clearly unfit
NC you had a chance to get rid of >>>@SenatorBurr who received campaign $$ from BetsyDeVos to gain his favor.
Vote NO on @BetsyDeVos. She's clearly unqualified. Our kids and teachers deserve better. Our country deserves better!
She will not protect public education,teachers,or students w/special needs. Vote NO, not party line!
You should listen your constituents>they are smart/Why the sell out over DeVos? We'll see I guess, alarming
DeVos wants to put educators out of jobs. Vote NO tomorrow!
Sir, why don't you listen to your constituents? You are failing them, and their children.
Please vote no on this lunatic
absolutely not, you are wrong on her, we will remember your vote
She is not qualified, nor does she hold the best interest of all children in mind. PLEASE VOTE NO. We are watching.
As a former public school teacher in CMS and Vance Counties, I urge you to reconsider. She is unfit and unqualified
Keep em poor,keep em sick & keep em stupid eh Dickie?NC will remember you,those of us in your district remember you
PLEASE do not vote for DeVos! We really need someone who has previous experience with public education.
Please do not support DeVos. She knows nothing about education and what is best for our children, our future!
She is completely unqualified.  You should recuse yourself from vote as you've taken money from her/her family.
@GOPHELP @BetsyDeVos You should be ashamed. Just proved political contributions are more important than our kids.
Shame on you. She is unqualified! The NEA does not support her. Please listen to the experts!
Thank you for ABLE act! Disabled students' education can't be left to states. NO @BetsyDeVos
donated $43,000+ to your campaign. If kids were the billionaires in your pocket then I bet you would be reject her.
Nooooooooo 
she is inexperienced, promotes a specific personal agenda and does not have the balance needed for this position
Are you out of your mind?  She has NO experience and is unqualified!  We count on you to vote #noDevos!!
is not the person we need for this job and as one of your constituents I ask that you vote against her tomorrow.
how can you vote for someone doesn't know what the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act is?
so disappointed to see you support devos who is singularly UNQUALIFIED and an outright threat to US education. Please vote NO.
I am a NC taxpayer and do not support Devos for Sec of Ed. Please take a second look. Our children's future @ stake.
Betsy is not qualified.  She actually said we need guns in schools to fight off grizzlies. she has no experience.
DeVoss knows nothing about public education; dedicated to destroying it. Nominated because of @GOP donations.
I'm in NC & can't get through on any # for Burr.  Doesn't care about his constituents--countdown to 2020 has begun
I just called your office.  Voting for this lady is insanity.  Unqualified, unfit. Your constituents are watching.
She will destroy our education system. Have you looked at her track record? Utterly unqualified.
@GOPHELP  How much money did her family give you? you should recuse yourself if you did.
.@SenatorBurr @BetsyDeVos this is the dumbest thing I have read all day, and I can read because @BetsyDeVos was not incharge of my education
You're bought and paid for by @BetsyDeVos and her family.
Who's "we"? Certainly not the children of the US
.@SenatorBurr So it looks like .@BetsyDeVos paid you about $286k for this seat. Is that correct?
Our data shows a number of donations from DeVos, family, & connected companies going to Burr's campaigns #DeVosFacts https://www.opensecrets.org/trump/nominee-giving … https://twitter.com/SenatorBurr/status/821795164117209088 …
$40,000 reasons - great work you hack
Shame on you, how much has she paid to get your vote?
Please explain how the $2.25M @BetsyDeVos indirectly donated to your campaign didn't influence your vote? Moral flexibility?$$$
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Just remember, plenty of seats up for grabs in 2018! Listen to the ALL the people who put you there!
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos once again, a politician more concerned with their job than their Voters! VOTE NO!
You obviously know nothing about education either. How many schools have you spent time in lately? All varieties?
RIchard not everything should be for profit Charter Schools steal money from the public stand 4 the people and PS
I am a retired PS teacher in NC.  Not surprised by ur endorsement.  U don't value public schools.
how much did her family pay you, senator traitor?
Career ending decision for you. Death knell for students. 

http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?type=C&cid=N00002221&newMem=N&cycle=2016 …
i guess you don't want to get another term in the senate? Vote NO on the highly UNQUALIFIED Devos!
Sen Burr your time is limited. Proud mom to a NC public school student who will fight against you and Betsy DeVos
She's god damned awful. #MakeAmericaStupidAgain
Why? She is wholly unqualified and is wrong for this position. Vote NO! Your constituents are watching.
Please reconsider, she has made it very clear that she is not the person for this job, very clear.
Please say no to DeVos #dotherightthing
She is the worst possible person for this position. NC schools are already terrible. Why do you want them to be worse? Support our kids!
Betsy is a poster child for why we need public education.  Michigan schools suffered greatly. She is ignorant
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos vote NO.
I'm a NC voter. I want you to vote to  #DenyDevos. Her policies take funds away from public schools
Please improve the neighborhood schools.Please don't divert money from neighborhood schools to private schools. No to DeVos.
@SenAlexander It's unconscionable you support DeVos. She is unsuited & cannot even discuss public school policy intelligently
Your Sec.of Ed. nominee is the first in U.S. history to be hostile to public education. #NotMySOE
Horrible conclusion. You don't actually believe this?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos where is that spread sheet showing how much her family has donated to the party and these senators?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos like a hole in the head..we DO NOT want her!
@SenAlexander  SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED #payforplay #moneytalks Our kids deserve better than ridiculous show of partisan politics
Why would you possibly support her? She is absolutely unqualified and absolutely unfit! Make America THINK Again!
NO! Do any of your constituents actually support this? No exp, and for all her "work" in MI, they rank 35th in USA
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos sad!
I vote in NC & do NOT support unqualified @BetsyDeVos for Sec. of Educ. When you do not represent me I do not vote for you.
no to DeVos.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos this is what happens when we don't have a strong DOE and OCR http://nebula.wsimg.com/189b65ab1287dbacd96df46a1ea335bd?AccessKeyId=D285A48BD88AE45BD415&disposition=0&alloworigin=1 …
Does not have the qualifications. She will kill our special needs population and the ones who care for them.
This is very disappointing. DeVos is astonishingly unqualified for this position. Put students first, vote no.

When the APTA Pediatric Section is also troubled over DeVos' lack of understanding of the federal law IDEA, you know it's time:  #DumpDeVos. 
.@SenatorBurr @BetsyDeVos TY for your service, Senator. Please reconsider this vote. We need a public school champion repping stakeholders.
plz vote NO to DeVos as Education Secy. Unqualified and will destroy our schools.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos  If you have ever been a public school administrator or teacher, you would not support her.
disappointing that you will vote for someone with so little experience in public education. Shame on you.
Think of rural children.Think of the most vulnerable children. Improve public schools for ALL the children. Vote NO on DeVos.
Dont be surprised when you dont get reelected for your support for DeVos against the American public
She's only proficient in money.  She has no idea what that even means.
This is so sad.  DeVos's goal seems to be to destroy the public education system.   How can you do this to the children of NC?
@GOPHELP @BetsyDeVos gave U $$ that's Y U sppt her!
Please do not do this, she is wildly unqualified. The people of NC do not want this, please listen to us.
You're all delusional.
has zero public education exp & no org or admin exp. She is NOT qualified to run the Dept of Education. #voteno
@SenAlexanders you are shameful in your continued support of @BetsyDeVos.  She is not remotely qualified.  #noDevos
@GOPHELP @BetsyDeVos  I don't understand this. You serve the people and their voice is crystal clear. Do your job and vote NO.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos absolutely not.
.@SenatorBurr @SenAlexander is it wise to support a nominee who doesn't understand or support public ED? Why not improve our public schools?
@SenAlexander please consider how parents of kids w special needs feel. She didn't even know it was law for their equal ed
How you can say that? She's barely put a foot in a public school. $$$$$$$ speak! #ilovepublicschools
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos no no no nobody in tn want her but you will push her down our throat
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos #notqualified #noIDEA #DumpDevos
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos No! She is completely off-base with what is needed! Not a single teacher I know wants her in office!
Are you capable of articulating why she's good for the job, other than the $43,200 her family has donated to you?
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos no no no she doesnt even know proficiency vs growth
U r kidding, right? She is not qualified! Why don't u guys stand up to Trump, and think of the people
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Sounds like "y'all" have no I.D.E.A. about what an ed sec qualifications should be.
it will be a sad sad day for America if she is confirmed.  The people of NC and of America implore you to vote NO
So it doesn't bother you that she said states shouldn't be required to educate disabled children? That's fucked up.
by all means, tell us what else makes you a disgusting person.
@SenAlexander @BetsyDeVos Comptence isn't a big deal to you, Sen. Burr?
I notice how you did not say the "most qualified person." The person you "need" is one who will obey.
She is not what we need!  Come on do your homework.  Say NO for DeVos!
vote no for her. She is not qualified. Remember those who can vote you out.
North Carolina disagrees! 40k is not worth the damage to our kids' futures! #Doyourjob !
I am so glad you are confirming Betsy DeVos.  Thank you.
NO! She is not qualified. Our children mean more than this. Our children deserve better.
Have fun explaining that decision to young Americans and the people who elected you
I'm done with school but when education takes a plunge under @BetsyDeVos you will be accountable too.
DO NOT support Betsy DeVos.She is totally unqualified.We expected you to keep Trump in check, not fall in line on every choice.
We're talking about education - the future of this nation. But you'd let @BetsyDeVos turn education into a joke? #unfit
You can't be serious. There is nothing that qualifies this woman to do anything in education
oh so you're NOT on the fence about her confirmation... unfortunate. She is utterly wrong for the role!!
as a teacher in Union Co, PLEASE STOP supporting this nomination. She is unqualified to make decisions for our public schools.
wrong
I sincerely hope you reevaluate your thoughts on her and I hope you speak out against Trump
Please reconsider. She is not qualified. Classroom mentor is whole of her pub ed experience. Not enough.
please reconsider your support of Betsy DeVos. She was only nominated because of her Republican campaign donations.
no exp w pub schools, as a student, teacher, admin or parent. doesn't kno policy- proficien vs growth,or Disab.Act.
.@SenatorBurr @BetsyDeVos Thank you for your leadership and for choosing what's best for all children over what's best for the "system".
- I think your constituents feel very differently Senator. Are you still committed to ignoring us? #NoOnDeVos
No. just no. No experience. No heart for public education at all. No knowledge of basic regulations.
Please reconsider. She is NOT prepared. You must NOT confirm this appointment. I stood with you and voted in hopes you would listen
.@SenatorBurr @BetsyDeVos is unqualified for the job. Vote No. you owe NC your best and she is NOT it!
I am your constituent.  Tried to leave msg. I do not support this nom. apparently you're not checking vmails? Vmail box is full
Shame on you, Richard.
I hope the collective voice of NC Educators has been heard and you've reconsidered your stance #voteNO @ncae
vote No. She is not qualified.
will you at least respond since you happily tweeted your support??!! Heartless and selfish!!
you both know she's not a good choice. You support you're own position not that of North Carolinians. SAD!!
PLEASE do not support her. You & I went to RJR in W-S & know the value of public education. She has NO experience.
Your kidding right? North Carolinians call Sen. Burr at 202-224-3154 and tell him to #StopDevos
#BetsyDeVos will hurt children, especially the weakest and poorest of them. Please reconsider your vote.
.@SenatorBurr please reconsider this statement. @BetsyDeVos isn't qualified for a teaching job, much less this position.
The woman is totally unqualified for the job.  Are you only supporting her because President Trump nominated her?
ty for rethinking. This is a nope from NC citizens
is not qualified. She has no experience as an educator. #saynotodevos
incompetence should not be confirmed no matter the 100s of millions in contributions. The 1%  is NOT the children of the US
against the wishes of a (steadily increasing) portion of your constituents. Thanks for not doing your job.
Seriously?! Please preserve our public schools by putting someone over the DOE who KNOWS about public schools!
I wonder if you'd feel that way if she didn't contribute to your political campaign. Shame on you. #bought&paidfor
Senator Burr, I beg of you to reconsider or recuse yourself. Her campaign $ isn't worth it. #paytoplayNOTok
let's get someone with relevant experience thanks
but not at the cost of our kids, I am a mom and I am so worried about my kids future!!
why dont we fix public education instead of destroying it?? We can have alternatives ok
No we dont need special interest she is unqualified you should vote your duty not your interest
She is the most unqualified and I am. NC citizen you are my senator, and you should reject this non sense
I disagree.  What are her qualifications?  I'm a Craven County voter.
Please oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos.  She will hijack the future. We cannot afford 4 years with her at the helm.
Can you explain her lack of knowledge about IDEA or proficiency v. growth?  As a NC educator I am very concerned.
@womensmarch this is a joke DeVos is no more qualified than my cat. Time to get you out of office. RECALL time.
betsy is not the right person to oversee education. Cutting funds to public education vouchers to the rich, wrong
is completely unqualified. How can you not see that? Pull your head out....of where ever
Betsy DeVos will destroy our wonderful UNC system here in North Carolina. She has minimal knowledge about education! VOTE NO!!!
Please reconsider your support for BetsyDeVos. She is definitely not the person for this job.
Listen to your constituents!  She is unqialify.
oh so rhe pwrson least qualified?  Like most of the nominees?  Sad!
#DeVos hearing showed she has no place leading the Dept of Ed. Understand the issues if you are leading the nation's #youth.
then you can count on losing my vote sir. She is absolutely not the person.
I didn't know we had grizzly bears in our public schools!!!  Actually, this isn't funny at all. She's an idiot. 
please do not confirm Deavos. Unqualified. Alienates. Untrustworthy.
#NotoDeVos
sir. NO. @BetsyDeVos
Respectfully, @SenatorBurr, @BetsyDeVos is not qualified for Sec of #Education. Opponent of #publiced--she proved this in MI! #NoToDeVos
As a life-long North Carolinian, I'm extremely disappointed you are supporting @BetsyDeVos.  She is extremely unqualified.
Your constituents do not agree w/ your support of B. DeVos. Check your email, phone calls, Facebook, tweets.
as an educator, I disagree. Please vote no.
