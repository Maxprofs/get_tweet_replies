You are not doing your part to keep our country safe. Foot dragging on Russian cyberattacks is outrageous. Are you reading the intel?
Help ensure they are kept safe by not allowing WWIII to be started by this poor half-staffed administration. Truly protect the troops.
@CNN @RepAdamSchiff @MSNBC @maddow @IndivisibleTeam @IndivisibleCA28 #WeThePeople demand Burr recuse from #TrumpRussia probe! DO YOUR JOB!
You thank them, then betray our country by not investigating #TrumpRussiaCollusion
If you want to do something for our Military & their FAMILIES - START THE TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. We all deserve ANSWERS. NOW.
Cyber war, spy wars, do not require the profit producing hardware. If we do not put humans in the mix at balance points of the grid, we lose
You're disgusting, Burr. Investigate Russia while these great women and men place their lives in the line for country. Do your job.
Seems you should sacrifice something,  too: 73% of (CBS&WSJ poll) demand independent commission because #YOUREFAILING #presidentgrabapussy
BURR is blocking a MILITARY investigation into Russian cyberwarfare.  Why?
If you really appreciate their sacrifices, do your job and investigate Trump.
You do know your voting record is public right?
Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Traitor Failure
Those men & women deserve better than your obstruction of the investigation to determine if Commander in Chief is compromised, you phony.
Did u tell them how u were one of the many GOP who either blocked or took BILLIONS from the budget 4 veterans of EVERY bill obama proposed
You have some nerve praising our vets when you yourself are s traitor #PutinWeb
If Burr cared about US security he would not sabotage Russian investigation. RECUSE. We
Home of the BRAVE ! TY for your service gentleman., @SenatorBurr  when are you going to defend us from this Russian  attack ? Traitor too?
A big thank you to our active duty and vets! Now it is time for you to step up and do your job on the Intel Comm Country 1st, not donors!
they should have arrested you for #Treason to the United States..you pollute our soldiers with your presence traitor #CommiesAndConfederates
Richard Burr served as a national security adviser to Trump’s campaign, is too close to Trump to lead an impartial investigation.
Traitors like you have no business touring any military base or talking to the real heroes.
Safe from Russians and domestic traitors?
Richard Burr is using his position as chairman to conceal Trump campaign docs that likely shed even more light on #TrumpRussia. Despicable.
Why are you planing to tax the GI BILL THAT OUR SERVICE MAN AND WOMEN EARN?
Recuse yourself from #TrumpRussia investigation Senator. #BurrMustRecuse

Please take a look at the numerous times he's voted Nay regarding VA funding.
doing your job to investigate #Trumprussia would also help keep America safe #BurrMustRecuse #russiagate
Did you also tell them you are covering for a traitorous CiC?
Unlike you who allows Russian interference to run rampant in the white house. Recuse yourself from Russia investigation. U R not impartial!
#Trumprussia
Want to keep our nation safe? How about a full #TrumpRussia investigation?
Then have them jail T$$$p!...
Thank them by investigating the treason that occurred on our soil and do your damn job!!! No more hold ups, do it!
Did you make jokes about putting a bullseye on their photos? Why not? You only joke about killing women? HRC your fav 
Burr caims to honor American servicepeople but is undermining investigation into the traitors behind the #TrumpRussia scandal. Disgusting.
Call 202-224-3154 and ask @SenatorBurr to recuse himself from the #TrumpRussiaProbe
Your self-serving, anti-American actions in NOT investigating Russian connections to our democratic process will be remembered in 2018!
What did they say about you protecting a traitor? #TrumpRussia
Help them do their job by doing your job and moving the #TrumpRussia investigation along. Atone for conspiring to smother story and #recuse.
Thank them BEFORE the screwing of them??!
How are you keeping us safe from Russia by dragging your feet? Investigate trump Russia now #TrumpRussia
Did our military folks mind that you are protecting Trump/Putin connection? Do they care about treason and your enabling of Trump?
Do your part and investigate #Trumprussia. That would keep our country safe. #doyourjob
Look at the officer to the left, you can tell he is trying to figure out how in the future to spot traitors like Sen. ScumBurr
#trumpgang 
LIARS. http://EVERY.SINGLE.ONE .
INDICT @USAGSessions @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @Cabinet @POTUS 
4 GRAFT TREASON #trumprussia
#TrumpRussia - Richard Burr is hiding evidence to protect Trump
Anybody who thinks Senate intel Russia probe will get to the bottom of things should read this... https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-russia-probe-flounders-amid-partisan-bickering-130323166.html …
What about the Trump/Russia investigation? Are you a patriot or a traitor ? #resist #Impeach45 #2018iscoming
Great way to avoid town hall meetings by appearing to appear to support our service people, yet you support trump in starting a war!
Then protect them by preventing WWIII. Your constituents are watching and waiting for results. You can maintain no power w/o a country.
Have you stopped by North Carolina's own recently? The NC Guard needs your help MORE than the Active Duty does Senator...
Please consider a town hall, Sen. Burr.
I pray that they stay safe with all the irresponsible saber rattling by the commander in chief. Nuclear war is not the answer.
About time you did something! And you said you are finished after this year?
Town hall meeting.    Try to show some bravery around the soldiers.
All credit due to the men & women of Ft. Bragg. No credit to you, since you don't even have the guts to hold a #TownHall for #NCvoters
Pretty sad you ride the veteran's coat tails rather than stand on your own merits. Have you retired yet?
When is your next town hall meeting?
Repeal and replace obamacare now!
Read @SpeakerRyan recorded talking with Kislyak, wonder if he discussed #trumpRussia or money laundering if so #complicit in #treason YIKES!
if only you would DO something to help vets instead of just using them for photo ops #OutofTouch #RubberStamp
I'm glad you're supporting our soldiers and @FtBraggNC but we want Town Halls
Amen!
They protect us during wars caused by people like @realDonaldTrump & you. They gather intell too, watch how close you stand for the photo op
Pls hurry up with your committee's #Russiagate investigation before our country is destroyed. Lotta #GOP gonna go down, draggin their feet
Excellent people.  However, lets make sure even the less fortunate have Health Insurance coverage, not just access.
Nice photo op/propaganda.Glad you met with them but not the people who pay your salary in your district.
i am happy that you stopped by and thanked them  how about a town hall to talk to your voters.
Please have a town hall meeting in NC. I'm backing Trump 100% Obama destroyed America. Rebuilding
Town Hall?  Grow a pair and have one.
Why don't you stop by a town hall and meet with your constituents, Senator? We have questions and concerns.
Then, fix ' theirs & ours! Healthcare! And, yes your 'stonewalling', D.C. Investigations is a great way to support their service...
