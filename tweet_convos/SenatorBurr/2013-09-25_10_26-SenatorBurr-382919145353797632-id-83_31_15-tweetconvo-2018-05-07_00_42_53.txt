@SenatorBurr Senate Must Act to #DefundObamacare: @JimDeMint Says Stop Government Takeover of Health Care http://heritageaction.com/2013/09/senate-must-act-to-defund-obamacare-jim-demint-says-stop-government-takeover-of-health-care/ … …
@SenatorBurr @PAC43 What kinda BS is this, Vote to Consider, Vote to Defund it Period. political double Talk!!
@SenatorBurr @PAC43 but will y'all keep it in it's current form?  Think re-election Senator!!
@SenatorBurr How do intend to vote on closure for the CR? Disappointed not seeing you #StandWithCruz It will be hard to support you in 2016.
@SenatorBurr & you're still a giant asshole. You'd be lucky to have 1oz. of courage Ted Cruz has. NC is ashamed of u.  #StandWithCruz
@SenatorBurr @PAC43 WE ARE SPEAKING. ARE THEY LISTENING? #DefundObamacare  BECAUSE WE REALIZE OBAMA DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE.
@SenatorBurr You used to be proud to be assoc with Jesse Helms (photos in your office). Don't disgrace his legacy. Stabd against Obamacare
@SenatorBurr Not great news cause 'considering' it doesn't mean you'e going to pass it. Please do what you can to stop ACA by defunding it!
@SenatorBurr so if it's a straight majority vote, we know the outcome.  Then what?  Now is the time to lead on principle.  (See Sen. Cruz).
@SenatorBurr 
Learn from Sen Cruz:

@SenatorBurr Obamacare needs to be defunded. Too expensive and too much gov't intrusion
@SenatorBurr Glad to hear it!  Anyone who votes for Obamacare should be required to have to use it!
@SenatorBurr or, as news outlets are reporting," Senate votes to advance bill to keep government open". #nopropagandazone

@SenatorBurr @TonyShirley1611: As a citizen of NC & the USA I am graciously asking you and your peers to defund Obamacare.
@SenatorBurr Senator, please vote on agreeing with the house vote.  Art, NC
@SenatorBurr He'll, I am 66 and will think about running against you.  I AM CONSERVATIVE.  A majority on NC citizens may agree with me.
@SenatorBurr Please get with it, Senator.  You do work for us.  You are NOT an elite citizen.......as many of you in DC power circles think.
@SenatorBurr This Obambacare is a failure in the making! Defund this now!!! North Carolinians are taking notes and will vote accordingly.
.@SenatorBurr Wow, it's so nice of you to come out of hiding to address the serfs.The question is how will you vote on Friday? #MakeDCListen
@SenatorBurr anything but a NO vote for cloture is blatant ignoring if your constituents.Vote #NoCloture or you're signing your pink slip
@SenatorBurr I hope with no parliament tricks Sir.
@SenatorBurr do you still think it is "The dumbest Idea I've ever Heard of" ? The Unaffordable NoCare Act is a train wreck.
@SenatorBurr Stop Obamacare you coward or you will be unelected.
@SenatorBurr when are you people gonna start doing something productive? You are stealing your paycheck.
@SenatorBurr will you say NO to cloture vote on fri? If NO yur other votes r meaningless and u will own O'care. We r watching.@HeritageActNC
@GinnyQuaglia @SenatorBurr @HeritageActNC Just be sure not to do anything productive. It'll mess up your streak.
