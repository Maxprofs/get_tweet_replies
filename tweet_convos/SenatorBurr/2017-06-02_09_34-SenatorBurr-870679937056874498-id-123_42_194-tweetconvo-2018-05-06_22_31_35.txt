What a man!!!
Since your soul is sold why not add socks? Stop working for yourself and start working for the people.
Nobody cares. 
Country over party AND socks. And take care of your constituents by not destroying healthcare.
Stuff a few in your cakehole and let the senator demand an answer to her question, you sexist tool.
Maybe sometime you could post a rare picture if you treating female senators with respect
You should of put one of those socks in your mouth today, Burr. You are an embarrassment to NC!!!!!!!
Nice collection! Also, umm... Senator, you seem to have forgotten your bank card the other day. No, really.
Glad you have time for this while abetting and covering up for a treasonous president. Must be hard work.
Why are we supporting RINOS in the Republican party?  WHY!
those socks have more integrity than you do.
your permanent smirk just screams "dipshit"
Socks are the new ties
YOU WERE ON TRUMP'S TRANSITION TEAM.  HOW HAVE YOU NOT RECUSED YOURSELF ALREADY???????????
I can't take you seriously! Buy some damn socks! With your misuse of our tax dollars,  you can afford a few pairs
Ugh, how old are you?
Too bad they couldn't have knitted you a pair of big boy pants for yesterday's hearing. Your Treatment of Sen Harris was pathetic. #Sad
How about a picture of you treating female senators as equals?
Do your JOB and quit trying to be funny!!!!!
Shame u can't spend more time to get Helathcare bill passed by Senate. Get off ur A$$ and do ur job. Do u even care about the ramifications?
Ok, but I've left a lot of voicemails about our state that you've never responded to.
I've written/faxed him 43 times!!! No response!
I had same problem with my Rep. what worked was trying all the local ph#'s till I got a person who cared. I hope this helps! Pretty state
Not interested in your frivolous sock collection.  Just hope you "sock it to" the President.  (to coin a phrase from Laugh-in).
Richard Burr continues to protect the interest of Putin and the Russian state.
Very troubling. Burr says he sees no Trump "wrongdoing" in Comey statement. 
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/06/comey-statement-trump-defenders-absurd-spin/ ‚Ä¶ 
Don't take away our health care! You look like a decent man!
Ask #Comey about the lawsuit Montgomery filed about the 47, etc computers!
stuff a sock in your biased mouth . quit interrupting Senator Harris just because she's female & raising legitimate questions and concerns.
Like the socks, but where is the OCare repeal? By the way, we all know how to buy insurance, we want this horrible law gone!
Sen. Burr,  
WRT admonishment of Sen. Harris,
Do you think ùò∫ùò∞ùò∂ ought to „èäve acted ùò¢ùòØùò∫ less demure than you expected ùò©ùò¶ùò≥ to?
@SenKamalaHarris
And no    either
I believe they make those in prison where people go when they sell out their country.  Something to think know about. Country over party.
That about sums up your personality.
Going against the conservative voters (that put u in office)& siding w/ libs, sets u up nicely to b a paid lobbyist n 6 years! No more RINOs
Cute, but why are you obstructing the Trump agenda? Why are you against the will of the US people?
We are worried about Russia. Be honest. Protect our democracy. Don't protect Trump. Then we'll send you all the socks you want. OK?
#DoYourJob!
I am a North Carolinian and I suggest to you forget the damn socks and get on board with POTUS agenda. Do something!
Who cares? Go give Politco another bs story & live in ur delusion. @GOP establishment is in for a rude awakening. We support Trump. Not you!
Instead of socks, please direct your attention to repealing and replacing the ACA! No single payer gov healthcare...road to poor quality!
R u a RINO?REPEAL OBAMACARE OR U WILL BE VOTED OUT!! U CAN BELIEVE PHONEY POLLS OR KEEP A GOP PROMISE. SO FAR UVE FAILED AND R WITH Amash!!
how about an even rarer photo of you doing your job
,Do your shoes get sweaty

You do realize that @GOP will be to blame for not stopping this insanity, right?
What an odious little man you are. Corrupt as the summer day is long. Putz.
yo spank , shame on you - blah blah blah , followed by another day of nothing
Take your socks and stuff them with a new Healthcare Law by end of July or NC will send you to Monre and offer you job at Tysons.
Where are the bulls eye socks?
Most definitely not a Monday...
Please do right by North Carolina folk who voted for you. Repeal Obamacare and build the wall. We are counting on you

So you took campaign money from DeVos and then voted to confirm her? You know what a conflict of interest is??
Give me a break Burr! Quit taking so many breaks & get done what you were elected to do. Get bills passed & support & work with Trump!
 thanks for supporting NC biz. Pls support Ocare, keep pre-existing conditions covered, and keep healthcare = price for women & men.
Senator you are fair/just and kind do not be blindsided by White House! The truth is not inconceivable neither is treason find out both#

Here @Buzzfeed reports on GOP voter anger at Congress--demanding they pass @potus agenda. https://www.buzzfeed.com/lissandravilla/iowans-think-donald-trump-needs-more-support-from-congress ‚Ä¶

The Senate would be a lot more effective if they had to run for re-election every 2 years...

The tragedy is that Democrats aren't even our problem at this point - the Congressional Leadership of our own party is.
http://Great.Now  get to work & do something for the American http://people.Healthcare ,budget & tax reform this year is a basic minimum

It's tragic that the Republican Congress could bury the Democrats for a generation just by enacting the Trump agenda, but they won't.
Thank you for being a grown up in the investigation. You're one of a few heroes doing the right thing and putting country first.
You are a criminal. Americans have a right to know what is in those reports.
Don't be a pushover. Show Russia we aren't afraid. Stand up for the People of the US; for our Law Enforcement. This is America.
How many more politicians must be blackmailed by Putin to destroy our country? Stop it once & for all. Make Russia pay for it!
Anyways, here to talk about Trump. Please don't let him cancel #ComeyHearing You have the power to make a difference Senator.
He's not blocking anything because he has nothing to hide. Do u really think after a yr of spying we wouldn't know? No evidence. Nothing.
Oooh I love those! I want! Especially the orange, grey, baby blue sets.
Will you speak with us, will you support a health care bill which will deny care to people with disabilities?
Who cares! Get to work! Loser
Not funny! America now knows how corrupt our gov't. is. If you want GOP voter support you better start cleaning it up! Start with Comey.
Let's get on with a new health care law. Can the Senate get anything done?
GET OCARE BILL REPLACED!!!!!

Get a grip.   The rarest sighting is you at a town hall.  date time and place, please. I will be there.
At least there are still adults left in the room. Time to put politics aside and pass legislation that actually help the people!
https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-06-02/republican-tax-cut-dreams-on-hold-as-lawmakers-await-trump-plan ‚Ä¶ Shame on Republican senators
You Senator Burr are an example why every day Republicans want to Drain The Swamp

Burr: Come on, we‚Äôre not going to get health care done this year http://hotair.com/archives/2017/06/02/burr-come-not-going-get-health-care-done-year/ ‚Ä¶
Stop Comey's plan to attack POTUS, but allege confidentiality when testimony could support POTUS, or reveals Obama spying or phony Collusion
Glad to see you working hard heading up that Russia investigation. No let's see you "sock" it to 45.
Good to see the investigation is moving forward!
No Healthcare this year........
We are done with DO NOTHING Senators like you  and the Repub DO NOTHING Senate
Awesome photo. Come visit us in Asheville to see some tents and backpacks being made! @diamondbrand #MadeInNC
So you don't think we can get rid of Obamacare this year like the @GOP promised? That make the GOP liars, including you. Keep your NC socks.
NO EXCUSES ON REPEALING OBAMACARE!  Get it DONE!
GET HEALTHCARE AND TAXCUT DONE.  NO VACATION UNTIL DONE.
Not as rare as spotting you talking with constituents! #townhall #DoYourJob
@totalfratmove

Wyden on torture rept coverup: "Attempts to erase history are the tactics of the insecure & the power hungry & have no place in a democracy"
@cleatuscups made here too. Veteran owned also. Come see us!
Great we still have some made in USA products
Adorable. As long as you're here in state, why not have a Town Hall?
Speaking of socks, stop dragging your goddamn feet on Russia inquiry and defend our country.
Not as rare as actually seeing you working
