Where are we on the treason investigations? A statement, please?
please pursue investigation re Russia and its election interference.
The health of those living in the US or even traveling as citizens is a Defensive responsibility of the government or any government.
Why is the federal government involved in healthcare?   Can't the communities fund it themselves?
Federal gov't has no legitimate power to provide healthcare - will fail like VA
#Constitution #FreeEnterprise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
^^ is a traitor to America.  Your misdeeds are coming to light. Ask for immunity, or off yourself.  Which will it be?
are you going to spray poison all over everywhere to cause us all brain, nerve damage? can't we protect ourselves + dump standing water?
Seriously? Ya'll had to pass a bill to fund mosquito prevention? Smoke Screen!! We aren't stupid!
Dick Burr the real #russianpuppet.
Why even pretend to care about something? You are a terrible man. Your family must be so ashamed to share your name.
Shame on you for protecting ZpOTUS
Why aren't you investigating the Trump/Russian connection?  Why are you dragging your feet on this?
Why are you colluding with Russia against Americans?
Nice, but please do your job and investigate the Russian scandal.
That's nice, especially since Trump plans massive cuts to CDC and NIH.
Wow, now you surely have time to schedule the 14 people directly involved in #RussiaGate & actually do something worthwhile.

so about that investigation your supposed to be doing?

Most under-reported story: Number of Koch pawns–Nunes, Burr, Cotton, Rubio, Blunt, MConnell interfering/stalling Trump-Russia investigation 
Thank you but you are obstructing justice with your Russian ties!
Thank you Senator Burr. Several yrs ago Democrats wouldn't pass bill to help Fla because they wanted to add waste in bill.
It's a  shame tht u all tacked on lots of pork on @POTUS44 orig'l Ziki crisis act! USA wouldnt b n this posit'n if #GOP  of the ppl 1st!
Great news!  NOW, what about the RUSSIANS???
That's great. Now do your damn job on Trump/Russia or recuse
If the Feds didn't tax so much local governments could handle these issues on their own.
Great! But zika won't be high on our concerns if democracy crumbles. Investigate Trump! And Flynn! And other possible treasonous people!
Are you joking?  Worried about Zika while impeding Russia investigation?  YOU should be investigated for treason!!!
Who is going to help us fight the law braking president and his staff we have now?
How do we stop the spread of Russian government infiltration into our democracy?
We vote! You work for us! Inaction on #Trump #Russia and #POTUS tax returns, abuse of ethics/office for personal financial gain unacceptable
vote no on #acha and listen to your constituents. this is SO weird you pretend to care about the zika virus. almost laughable at this point
NC residents: Check out this thread on Alevo battery co. Are you ok with Russian oligarchs hijacking the power grid?
Burr's obstruction: remember when Ryblovlev went to NC supposedly to see Alevo? https://twitter.com/McClatchyDC/status/847133759052922882 …
2. The real menace we face is when those we elect to Congress act first 2 protect their Party instead of Americans! #DoYourJob #TaxReturns
What about the support Trump needs to "Make America Great Again"
1. You do realize the most dangerous menace we face across US is NOT Zika. It's members of Congress who fail 2 act 2 protect our democracy!
Show us you actually care about our health: vote no on #AHCA
If we only had a SMASH act to swat all of the Republicans in house and senate who obstruct the Trump/Russia investigation...
But you're also trying to cut access to healthcare so if anyone contracts Zika they won't be able to access care 
Zika?  How about RUSSIA?  Stop sandbagging, and DO YOUR JOB Senator!!!!
Have you seen this?
Burr's obstruction: remember when Ryblovlev went to NC supposedly to see Alevo? https://twitter.com/McClatchyDC/status/847133759052922882 …
Don't act like you care. We already know better senator #russiagate #trumpRussia #TheResistance #Ω #isupportanindependenttrumprussiaprobe
So would expanding funding for public health initiatives.
