@robsaxan @N7HWW @SenatorBurr a coward who never served either.
@SenatorBurr Where did you go while the veterans testified before your contemporaries? Did you skip out for lunch? Bathroom break?
@SenatorBurr your leaving the hearing was so disrespect of men and women who have served so unselfishly. NC needs a better Senator.
. @SenatorBurr is not a friend to vets.
@SenatorBurr the people who are Veterans have a clear understanding of what could improve the VA When will your party stand up for the Vets
@SenatorBurr @maddow LOL Rachel Maddow raking Sen Burr over the coals now for being such a jerk to veterans.  He's the lead story. LOLOLOL!

@SenatorBurr This is another example of you playing politics instead of trying to make things better. You're an embarrassment. Shame on you!
@SenatorBurr Vote this man out of office.  He did not even have the respect to stay and listen to the veteran groups that testified. Traitor
@SenatorBurr the VA does not have to be for profit it needs to be made easier to access good safe and timely health care!
@SenatorBurr hey asshole,  very disrespectful to walk on the hearing then bitch about what was said..you need to resign
@SenatorBurr I hope all the Vets in NC make sure you never win office again.
@SenatorBurr the VA needs more money, more staff, more resources, more infrastructure shame on you for blaming those Vets who work for Vets
@SenatorBurr How are you able to reference the testimony of veterans' groups when you, in fact, did not bother to witness said testimony?
@SenatorBurr The hearing where you walked out?
@SenatorBurr I love the way you represent veterans issues in Washington D.C.... said no one ever! #fail #senatorlawnmower #jerk
Do U have a PR pro 2 tell U not 2 do this? RT @SenatorBurr: My open letter to America’s veterans: http://1.usa.gov/1kby2N3  #VAaccountability
@SenatorBurr You LEFT the hearings & DIDN'T LISTEN to ONE WORD: how the HELL do you DARE lie about our Vets' motives? You FILTH.
@SenatorBurr You walked out of the hearing during Vet groups testimony. You refused to listen but claim the right to criticize? Resign now.
@SenatorBurr this letter is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen.  Shame on you.  I have no words.   Our Vets deserve so much better.
@SenatorBurr Sir, you dishonor the service and sacrifices of all veterans by questioning their integrity. Focus on solving the problem.

@SenatorBurr And yoou are proud of this garbage...kick rocks senator

@SenatorBurr Does this "open letter" mention that you were one of those who BLOCKED THE VETERANS' BILL? 

Didn't think so.

You phony.
@SenatorBurr ALL NCans must truly b DISGUSTED & APPALLED at a nonvet crackpot like u dressing down Am's vets on Memorial Day wkend! DOA11/4!
@SenatorBurr "You clearly represent the worst of politics in this country." - Paralyzed Veterans of America
@SenatorBurr the VA accountability is that we sent to fight and defend us we promised to care for them just stand up and honor our promise
@SenatorBurr why is everything about making it a private operation? Why does everything be about making someone money
@SenatorBurr maybe if you give resources to the VA jobs would be created oh I forgot the GOP do not want that.
@SenatorBurr I will pay more taxes to take care of all men and women who let me live in this fantastic country give them the resources
@SenatorBurr I find your actions disgraceful and upsetting. The problem with our country is Senators like you who refuse to be respectful
@SenatorBurr Shame on you. An apology is in order. You dishonor your office & disrespect veterans. Shame.
@SenatorBurr stop blaming #veterans & @VFWHQ! You're on #VeteransAffairs & you voted no to expand Vet care (S.1982)! http://www.vfw.org/News-and-Events/Articles/2014-Articles/VFW-Comment-on-Senator-Burr%E2%80%99s-Open-Letter-to-Veterans/#.U4TUHWwvXSQ.facebook …
@SenatorBurr Media flack over your letter to VHOs chiding them on faults YOU perceive,  gives ammo to the enemy. Send publc apology #FoxNews
@SenatorBurr You are a disgrace to this fine State. Not since Helms have I been more ashamed of NC politicians. You really should resign.
@SenatorBurr You sir are a damn fool. Never served one day and you're questioning the motives of groups dedicated to helping veterans? #FU
@SenatorBurr is not a vet. Shut up with u r BS about vets.
.@SenatorBurr You filibustered the Veteran's Bill then have the temerity to whine that not enough is being done? YOU are part of the problem
@SenatorBurr Pretty clear Phx US Atty office should convene Grand Jury to hear evidence on falsified records to get bonuses Not good record
@SenatorBurr You starve the VA of resources and then blame it for shortcomings. Standard GOP M.O.
@SenatorBurr I &100's of thous like me defend your right to say what you want but don't think for a sec we agree. Restore VA funding.
@SenatorBurr and they rightfully handed your ass back to you: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/25/richard-burr-veterans_n_5389296.html … . It is truly shameful all the legislation you opposed
@SenatorBurr Cries & Screams About Vet Health Care Scandal, But @SenatorBurr Voted Against Expanding Health Care for Vets Back in Feb 2014
.@SenatorBurr have you read the VFWs letter to you? How about DAVs? Or maybe the Paralyzed Vets? They're not happy with you, you ass.
@SenatorBurr If you cared about vets, you'd quit blocking legislation that funds their care instead of issuing cheap shots @VFW on Mem. day.
@SenatorBurr How'd that work out for you, idiot?
@SenatorBurr It is offensive and shows disrespect. I live in NC! U have lost my respect. I once supported and voted for U!
@SenatorBurr spoken like frat boy who's never served a day for his nation.Sitting on your ass in #Congress doesn't count for shit. #Veterans
@SenatorBurr I hope every VSO that you cowardly threw under the bus supports every challenger to your Senate seat. You are an embarrassment.
@SenatorBurr Wow, that open letter to #Vets was a horrible idea. For once I'm glad I'm no longer a #northcarolina resident. #VA Scandal
@SenatorBurr after 19 years in office maybe it's time you accept some responsibility instead blaming everyone else, eh? Enough deception.
@SenatorBurr SHAME! #VAaccountability indeed. Look at your voting record and grovel out an apology, You are unfit to serve us. Vets matter!
@SenatorBurr And the response to it from several veterans' groups: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/25/richard-burr-veterans_n_5389296.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013 … Doesn't sound like they're too impressed with it.
@SenatorBurr You insult Vets & that makes u dishonorable. Move 2 Russia where ur hate, intolerance,& ideological purity would be accepted
@SenatorBurr your letter was despicable, and very offensive to our veterans perhaps you should have even came to hear the VSO's testified.
@SenatorBurr Guess U got schooled by VFW two faced politician
@SenatorBurr Stop blaming others. People go to prison or your words are meaningless and you lose all honor and respect.
@SenatorBurr Negligent homicided & medical malpractice are felonies, Senator. It happened on your watch. Fix it. Send people to prison.
.@SenatorBurr You suck. http://blogs.rollcall.com/wgdb/vfw-torches-burr-in-spat-over-va-leadership/?SD …
