@SenatorBurr w/a/due respect Senator you are wrong.  I saw an empty chamber whilst both Sens. Lee and Cruz filibustered.  Where were you?

@FL_Chelle @HarrietBaldwin @SenatorBurr @DanzGeorge @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee Pls send Constitutionalists to NC. We are in short supply
@SenatorBurr The man was full of passion and conviction.  More than I can say for the rest of you.
@SenatorBurr Your inability to stand in this crisis and not support your base. VETERANS DON'T SUPPORT HIM!
.@SenatorBurr Admit you're lazy & you don't care about America. I'd have more respect for you if you'd just come out of the commie closet.
@SenatorBurr  So its better to bend over to Reid . Its time to get rid of all you RINOS
@SenatorBurr  You don't represent my view and you will not get another vote from me.
@SenatorBurr enjoy ur lay few mins in Washington cause ur on ur way out. Traitor! !
@SenatorBurr enjoy ur time there cause its gonna be short.  Ur a liar and a traitor and ur a low life democRAT!
.@SenatorBurr So you are going against the will of your constituents. Duly noted. You are part of the problem: #MakeDCListen
@SenatorBurr   We The People DO NOT want ObozoCare, start LISTENING. If it's not good enough for YOU why are you shoving it down MY throat?
@SenatorBurr  hypocrisy is you.
.@SenatorBurr so essentially, Senator, you're just telling people to "lie back and enjoy it?"
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin Hot air, bluster, bombast; substance? No, not so much.
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin  FUCK YOU!
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin I ask again, what is your strategy Sen? To come on Twitter, type 24 words of crap and disappear? We are waiting
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin Then step up Senator, let us know your plan, your strategy. We are waiting Sir
@SenatorBurr NC didn't want ACA now our local Hosp is in distress due 2 Medicare& medicaid $$ decreased under #Obamacare #DefundTheGOP
@SenatorBurr your constituents should NEVER FORGET...#pushback2014
@SenatorBurr 
You won't think so in your next primary, get ready for it because you are done.
@SenatorBurr what a low life. It didn't take u long to fall in w/ all the other crooks
@HarrietBaldwin seems another Senator doesn't understand the Constitution or its majesty. Do you think we should test Sens?
@SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr  no Dem or Rep. had any input in this Law! Only O's Communist advisors put it together. I not going  to support unless u Defund
@SenatorBurr you are a statist and a hypocrit! Just another RINO
@SenatorBurr #heresyourspine
.@SenatorBurr When did standing up for the Constitution of the United States, Liberty & #WeThePpl become hypocrisy? Plz find a new career.
@SenatorBurr.  U are the height of hypicrisy. claiming to represent ur state but not listening to voters. U will listen in nxt election
@SenatorBurr Should have supported @sentedcruz. Now have to hold the line: DELAY ACA. Repeal med device tax, All FED workers incl in ACA
@SenatorBurr - people will remember how you sold them down the river and I for one will make sure they remember come your next election
@SenatorBurr your lucky NC don't have a recall vote because your arse would be up for recall bright and early monday morning.
@SenatorBurr Look, Both NC Senators want a repeat of Colorado Recall - When a majority of constituents are ignored they tend to act that way
@SenatorBurr  U Repubs give up the fight before the fight begins. Fight against Obamacare and fight to win.
@SenatorBurr  Quit being afraid of a gov shutdown.  Polls show almost as many people will blame Obama as the Repubs.
@SenatorBurr  Cruz/Lee spent a lot of time convincing people of how bad the law was.  That was worth something to me. U voted for cloture.
@SenatorBurr  U should have stood with Cruz/Lee.  At least they were doing what they could to stop Obamacare. Even if it was educating peopl
@SenatorBurr Don't shut down Government!! But Please VOTE with 90% of us Americans and defund Obamacare! Don't be Spineless!
@SenatorBurr It's no sweat off your back, Senator, since you and your staff have that nice little exemption. No pain for you, plenty for us.
@SenatorBurr So you are going against the will of your constituents. Duly noted. You are part of the problem: I voted 4 U NEVER AGAIN
@SenatorBurr NC HAD A VOICE IN DC VIA @SenTedCruz,NOT BY YOU. TO THINK A SENATOR FROM TX SUPPORTS NC MORE THAN YOU AND @SenatorHagan #ORPUW

@SenatorBurr  YOU are the height of hypocrasy ! I am ashamed of you. Next election I will ACTIVELY campaign for your opponent .
@SenatorBurr last time I voted for you cause I thought you were conservative and not a rino - won't happen next time we need a true conserv

@SenatorBurr I am ashamed to have you for a Senator now. #RedNationRising
@SenatorBurr You wish you had the strength to stand against the corruption. You are a RINO. #RedNationRising
@SenatorBurr You, sir, are the hypocrite. Take some lessons from @SenTedCruz. At least he has a backbone and doing the job he was sent to do
@SenatorBurr enjoy your last term traitor, we intend on voting your RINO butt out.
@SenatorBurr Your arrogance & idiocy are stunning. You just voted to destroy the country. You're a coward & a fraud.
@SenatorBurr Your vote today made a huge statement for supporting term limits and repealing the 17th Amendment.
@SenatorBurr And what is your strategy? Hide behind McCain and watch the country burn? You did nothing. @SenTedCruz ' conscious is clear.
@SenatorBurr YOURE GOING TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE SENATOR.
@SenatorBurr You just lost my vote.  I think you'd be more comfortable seated on the other side of the aisle. #Rino
@SenatorBurr You don't get it!  Senator Cruz speaks for the PEOPLE!  Wow... how disconnected you have become!
@SenatorBurr u couldn't be more wrong & totally in the dark & out-of-touch with #WeThePeople.  This will be remembered, & not in ur favor.
@SenatorBurr I don't care if you are the only one running I will never vote for you again!!
@SenatorBurr but it stands up for us the american people!!!!
@SenatorBurr Someone above said "I hope they send you home."  I live in NC & CAN send you home.  Take a cue from Mr.Cruz & #MakeDCListen .
@SenatorBurr unlike the morons on here, I'd rather take the Senate in '14 good job for not causing another '96 election
@SenatorBurr so its better to not fight at all & side with Reid & Dems?...N. Carolinians r fighters..thats how we got the name Tar Heels smh
@SenatorBurr You are a hypocrite!
@SenatorBurr I got three words for you: Pri. Ma. Ry.
@SenatorBurr you and yur mentor Reid, Obama and hagan r the the height of hypocrisy. Hiding behind yur own cushy O'care subsidies.
@SenatorBurr criticism is hypocritical. Do you think Senator Cruz was sent to represent the Govt., the Party and it's leaders or the people.
@SenatorBurr What's hollow is the same old GOP whine.Y'all lie down and whimper like a beat dog. Give up your place to someone with spunk.
@SenatorBurr -- no campaign contrib. 2 u from us thru RNC.  We will contribute directly to #teaparty candidates & vote in primaries.
@SenatorBurr And just what is/was your strategy sir? #noleadership
.@SenatorBurr Hypocrisy=You voting with Reid & not standing with your constituents. You own this #BurrCare #NCGOP #haction
@SenatorBurr You have had since 2010 to do something about this trainwreck and you do jack-shit. Politics over populace.
@SenatorBurr No hypocracy is Forcing a Bill that Congress and Staff are Exempt From. #WeThePeasants
@SenatorBurr Repubs who voted with the dems today; not appreciated by conservatives and political accountability shall be a reality.
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin You WILL be voted out next election.
@SenatorBurr I will find a true conservative to run in primary against you.
@SenatorBurr I am now sorry I worked so hard to help get you elected. You have hurt job prospects in NC.
@SenatorBurr Repubs that create ultra-conservative nutjobs reap what they sow. A small minority of primary voters holds your party hostage.
@SenatorBurr "All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing" - Edmund Burke #CourageIsHard
@SenatorBurr Appreciate your standing with Obama on this one Mr. Burr.  2014 elections just around the corner!  I'll be focused on YOU.
@SenatorBurr way to throw TC under the bus #GOPEatsTheirOwn.
@SenatorBurr Sen. Burr your colleague brings light to the situation. You sir are a do nothing appeaser/conservative-light. Signed easternNC.
What happens when your job is to obfuscate & lay false premise foundations? Your base can't keep up. Good job @SenatorBurr
“@SenatorBurr: Filibustering such a bill is not only the height of hypocrisy..." Enjoy your final term, Burr.
@SenatorBurr It is hypocritical of you to say you oppose #Obamacare, yet not take advantage of every opportunity to end it. #MakeDCListen
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin We shall see what the true Conservative voters have to say about that. #MakeDCListen #CruzOn
@SenatorBurr Senator, get out of the beltway every once in a while.  Your constituents are tired of Washington games and want you to fight!!
What is crystal clear is your pompous attitude towards the American people and their wishes. Who are you really working for? @SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr senator, we do not need go along to get along types. We need people on the right who will stand up and fight like the left does
@SenatorBurr Oppose cloture and defund #Obamacare
@SenatorBurr Hypocrite! FLASHBACK: McCain&Corker were FOR TedCruz's strategy against Obamacare b4 he was against it
@SenatorBurr Thanks for showing North Carolinian's you're true colors. #rhino  #DeadToMe
.@SenatorBurr I suppose conversely, rolling over as Harry Reid's putz is great strategy? We'll retire you to #MakeDCListen @HarrietBaldwin
@SenatorBurr It's also the height of hyprocrisy not to change your affiliation to PROGRESSIVE Republican. Goodness knows, you're not alone.
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin nope, the height of hypocrisy is a Senator, knowing the reality, voting to bankrupt our nation
@SenatorBurr hasta la vista.  you are finished
@SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin I hope they send you home
@travelinchick @SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin I hope we send him to Californication. Don't need his whiny butt here in NC.
@SenatorBurr jobs for disabled vets from your state
@SenatorBurr STFU..TIME TO FIND NEW SENATOR FROM N.C.  WE CAN AND DESERVE BETTER
@SenatorBurr is living in the real world unlike ANYBODY who would rather shut down govt or thinks a defund has .000001% chance of happening.
@SenatorBurr @RagCon I hope the Tea Party runs you out along with your House member who made a fool out of herself today.
@RDSUK @RagCon @SenatorBurr We will take care of Mr. Burr, he will never be re-elected again
@Crossbearer1956 @RagCon @SenatorBurr Good. Also go after your 2nd district Rep. She is awful
@SenatorBurr When is your term up?
@SenatorBurr You took your phone off the hook & IGNORED what your constituents wanted. No matter how you spin it,you voted to FUND OBAMACARE
@SenatorBurr U REALLY DON'T GET IT DO U? WE THE PEOPLE SUPPORT SEN. CRUZ BECAUSE HE LISTENS 2 US I WISH HE WAS MY SENATOR INSTEAD OF U!!
@SenatorBurr rino
@SenatorBurr No sir, it lays bare your yes votes for the world to see who will be to blame when the middle class falls apart.
@SenatorBurr @EricAmey2 how is it hypocrisy? Maybe u don't keep your promises but @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee &too few others do. #MakeDCListen
BOOM MT @SenatorBurr: Filibustering such a bill not only the height of hypocrisy, but also lays bare hollowness of this so-called strategy.
@SenatorBurr WHY THANK YOU SENATOR, NOW I AM NOT ONLY AN ANARCHIST, WOW, NOW A HYPOCRITE?
Hey @SenatorBurr thanks talking big, then for doing nothing. Calling your next campaign "The Lip Service Express"
@SenatorBurr thinks fighting ObamaCare is "hollow"
@SenatorBurr if you voted for cloture ill never vote for you again, in fact I may run against you #rhino
@SenatorBurr So now we know!  #BurrNeedsToGo.  You are a RINO who isn't really interested in stopping ObamaCare!
@SenatorBurr Thanks for siding with Obama and Reid, Senator. #epicfail #forward @HarrietBaldwin
@talkradio200 @EricAmey2 @SenatorBurr @HarrietBaldwin @RoyBluntMO Roy will vote for cloture: http://exm.nr/1h8LkEo
