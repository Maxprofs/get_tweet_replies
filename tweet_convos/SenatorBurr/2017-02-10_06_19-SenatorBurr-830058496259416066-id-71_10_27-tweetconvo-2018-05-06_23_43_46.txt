No block grants no reduction in coverage. All need to be covered
Statement, eh? Does it mention #PartybeforeCountry or $$$$?
need to tweak it, not repeal it. My sister has insurance now because of Obamacare! Burr & othrs can't stand the name
Note 80,000 NC citizens showed up today to fight against the Republicans.  You going down.
Did @RepTomPrice pay you off too? Or do you genuinely think the guy is right for HHS? Asking for voters in NC
Pretty sure he will be getting stock tips from price! Crooks!
Would like a Town Hall meeting soon, so we  can all express our joy at this news!
Lemme save you some time on future tweets: “I support whatever GOP/Trump has done b/c I am a rubber-stamping butt snorkeler.”
trump is an ignorant ,orange buffoon who is absolutely morally bankrupt. What does that say about his deplorables?
I've called everyday for the last 3 weeks and have not once spoken to a staffer.Again, why won't you listen to yr constituents?
So is Congress just going to look the other way while Trump is in Florida showing off his golf course??!!
80,000 NC Citizens showed up in Raleigh to fight the Republicans hate agenda. We are not going away.  100,000 next
how much money did you get for that vote?  I know Betsy's vote was $45,000 more or less
So disappointed in your confirmation of T Price.  Please provide us with replacement ACA plan!  Don't repeal;fix!
Ditto
About the #ACA - where is your viable alternative? Don't repeal if you can't replace and improve!
Trump took funding away from ACA  his first day. They are waiting til that causes premiums to go up
This guy is a crook. Voting on legislation that will increase the value of medical stock he just purchased?
Oldest Republican trick in the book, defund something and wait til doesn't work correctly then get rid of it!!
I'm a physician against Price buying stock in health care companies and then promoting legislation for his profit
Ditto! What in the world are our congressman thinking? ; getting richer? Oh I get it now!

@Step_Walk_run Campaign, march, vote! They r shills 4 NC real estate developers & track house builders. #NoGoodForThePeople.
Reps are just stalling til premiums go up, then they can say Obamacare doesn't work! Trump stopped funds first day
Trump took funding from ACA first day in office. They are waiting for premiums to go up to do anything!!
you are an embarrassment to NC; your cowardly partner in crime is just as bad; Can't wait to get you two voted out
I am very disappointed that you supported Price who should be going to jail for inside trading.  Will not forget
Ditto
If you were holding town halls, you would know that your constituents want fixes to the ACA, not repeal. -Carrboro resident
Yess.,but he doesn't care. It's all about defaming Pres. Obama which never happen. He has more moral fiber in
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
You know it!
hey senator, when is the next town hall scheduled? Oh, I forgot you don't care what we lowly NC residents think.
Ditto
. @SenatorBurr @RepTomPrice Your constituents rely on the #ACA. Improve it, don't repeal it.
Reps waiting til premiums go up cause they took funds away Trump's first day. Then say doesnt work
Try representing US, your constituents? Have a town hall meeting to see what we think. Many would attend.
he doesn't have the courage to have several town halls
nope because it's all about how much he can line his pockets. trump is probably paying them
Surely you are not unaware of his corruption/abuse of power. We'll remember that you turned a blind eye.
please quit hiding behind tweets. Are you decent enough to meet your constituents?
You have already made the next NC GOP Senator lose his/her race.  SAD!  DISGRACE!

You get money from DeVos & Insurance, him from special medical stock, 1 corrupt politician to another #corruption
thanks for addressing constituents' concerns about Price's self-dealings while in the House. Now we feel better
How much did price pay for your endorsement? We will #rememberinnovember
Our eyes are locked on you.
Don't repeal what you are not prepared to replace. Let's talk. We will be around as long as you. We are watching.
when will you have a town hall?
No,being an Ortho surgeon doesn't put U intouch w/ health needs of American families. See a Social Wrkr for that.
@SenThomTillis   We demand a town hall meeting.
Pls consider signing a petition asking for @SenThomTillis townhalls- Sign & retweet! #TheResistance
Price's insider stock trades & legislation benefiting companies he owns stock in = #unethical
#SHAME sir, on all of you for taking healthcare away. You have no replacement plan, the repeal of ACA is spiteful
How's your hlth care plan working out for you Senator?Oh that's right you're all set as 'Senator' -my bad.
I am not surprised that you voted for this guy because your just a republican puppet.
- How much did you get paid for that vote? 
As a physician and constituent I know many patients who need the ACA for their health care. #ProtectOurCare
I am your constituent. You again ignored your voters' wishes and chose another ethically challenged cabinet member #doyourjob
Congressional stock tip.  Purchase in the industry.  Legislation in favor of industry (purchase).  Thanks Burr.
now if only he believed in affirmative government policies to improve public health.
Once again you have betrayed the people of NC by ignoring our voluminous requests for you to vote NO for Price.  #Currupt
- Ues but.... He needs the money to support his lifestyle. What's a few lives lost in order to sustain that? 
great
You and the GOP own it all and will not be forgotten
How do u plan to lower costs and allow for pre-existing conditions without requiring healthy people to sign up?
Proud of that are ya?  #ACA #resist #ResistTrump #Corruption #driantheswamp
Listen to your constituents. Do not repeal ACA. Fix it, don't nix it.
Face us. Hear us. Hold a Twon Hall. Coward. You'll hide in DC And we will vote you out
.@SenatorBurr @RepTomPrice doesn't think women ever have a hard time paying for birth control. He's wrong, ignorant, & prejudiced, like you
Women can go to PP for birth control - oh wait mmm how's that going to work?
Price wants to destroy ACA & Medicare. You have no regard for constituents' health care. VOTERS will remember.
and you will not win reelection next time.
.@tjcpigpen I believe @SenatorBurr has decided not to run again, because he is a coward.
where/when is our town hall?
Investigation of the Russian connections is of paramount importance. We demand the truth! #impeachTrump
Just another cabinet member who has no regard for Americans. Worst cabinet ever! 2018! #impeach
you still don't care about your constituents who depend on ACA, do you? #GOPdoesntcareaboutyou
