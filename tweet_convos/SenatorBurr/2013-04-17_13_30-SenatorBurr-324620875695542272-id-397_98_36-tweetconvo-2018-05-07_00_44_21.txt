@aishlingmara @SenatorBurr I am SO sorry for your loss!

@SenatorBurr You should be ashamed of yourself. 90% of your constituents want common sense background checks. #momsdemand
@SenatorBurr How much blood must be spilled so you can get over your insecurities and stop replying on steel to make yourself feel like man?

@SenatorBurr Read this ... and be ashamed: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html …
“@SenatorBurr: The Manchin-Toomey Amendment has failed -- proud to defend  2ndAmdt rights.” /ashamed this is  my Senator. SHAME, Sen Burr
@SenatorBurr you were elected by a democratic process, yet you failed to support that process in allowing a vote. You are a disgrace
@SenatorBurr But how does background checking encroach upon 2nd amendment rights?
@SenatorBurr You should be ashamed of yourself. The blood of children is on your hands #criminalvoter #criminalcongressman
@SenatorBurr 2nd Amendment Rights include "well regulated" which obviously the purchase of firearms clearly are not. Shame on you.

Shame on you!
@SenatorBurr you should be ashamed of yourself! #disgusting
@SenatorBurr Shame on you!

@SenatorBurr 55-45 is not a very close vote - we need filibuster reform NOW, and we need to dump these tools of the NRA.
@SenatorBurr if 20 dead 6 year olds doesn't make you do the right thing, then I have no use for you. SHAME ON YOU.
@SenatorBurr Your joy will be undone by all the many who will vote NO come your next election. No one likes a gutless sycophant.

@SenatorBurr why is it ok for the 2nd amendment to impede on americans right to life? #COWARD #SADDAYINNC #SHAMEONYOU
@SenatorBurr 94% of American want more strict gun laws!
@SenatorBurr if legislation that 90% of Americans support can't be voted on and passed by simple majority, we do not live in a democracy!
“@SenatorBurr: The Manchin-Toomey Amendment has failed -- proud to defend law-abiding Americans' #2ndAmdt rights.” How about dead kids?

@SenatorBurr - you're proud of voting against 92% of your constiuents in favor of vocal minority who lied about what this amendment does
@SenatorBurr Thx for supporting the 2nd Amend and not falling victim to the repulsive use of #Newtown to push political agenda.

@SenatorBurr you didn't defend anybody's rights with this vote - you spat on any number of graves. Glad to hear you're proud of that man
@SenatorBurr What is YOUR plan to reduce gun violence?  M-T amendment did NOT infringe on 2nd amend rights.
@SenatorBurr so what you're saying is you're proud to have voted against what the majority of Americans want. You are a coward.
@SenatorBurr SHAME ON YOU! We will have your seat for this vote! May the faces of those innocent children haunt your dreams forever.
@TomDangora we all need to remember 2014
@SenatorBurr Thank you for using facts over emotions with your #guncontrol vote and for protecting our Constitution #2a
@SenatorBurr Weird, I thought it was a CRIMINAL background check.  So are you going to work to repeal all criminal background checks?
@SenatorBurr You are gutless.
@SenatorBurr thanks for supporting the @NRA and NOT the people of my state!! Shame on you!!!
@SenatorBurr what a disgrace.
@SenatorBurr Without background checks how do you know they are law-abiding? http://nyti.ms/17215tM   You voted against the American people.
@SenatorBurr this guy is a disgrace @ckuznezov @CurtBurnette
.@SenatorBurr My neighbor's ex used the gunshow loophole to buy gun & shoot her dead in front of our kids' school. She was your constituent

@SenatorBurr Thank you!
@SenatorBurr shame on you, you NRA whore!
@SenatorBurr everyone should carry a Gun  if everyone has a Gun  then the criminals would have something to worry about ???
@SenatorBurr Washington has no clue. Any criminal can buy a gun on the streets   "Criminals don't need or do back ground checks"
@SenatorBurr thank you Mr.Burr. Don't let them punish law respecting Americans
@SenatorBurr  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@SenatorBurr #ShameOnYou
@SenatorBurr We will replace you -To do nothing while others are in danger is not the American way.
@SenatorBurr  National Rifle Association, which in the last election cycle spent  $25 million on contributions, lobbying outside spending.
@SenatorBurr  blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for  criminals  get hold of  deadly firearms. Great.
@SenatorBurr blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for  criminals to get hold of  deadly firearms.WayToGo.
@SenatorBurr in a country with lax  gun control laws.  30,000 people are killed  each year due to guns...  and we just shrug
@SenatorBurr We  feel we will not be safe until the Boston Marathon terrorist is caught -  and yet we let our children go to school each day
@SenatorBurr Coward.

@SenatorBurr U are a vile, @NRA lover with zero compassion. Way to help the downward spiral of ur country.
@SenatorBurr  I live in NC and thought the gun control legislation should have been approved.  You get an "F" and no vote next election.
@SenatorBurr as a victim of violent crime, I am shocked by your vote today which said my family's lives are worth less than your NRA money
@SenatorBurr "proud to defend law-abiding Americans' #2ndAmdt rights" and those of convicted felons. #goodjob

@SenatorBurr so sad I'm represented by someone who could care less about the population. You're a disgrace to this state. #votethemout
@SenatorBurr I'm thankful you do not represent me. Nor do you represent 90% of Americans. disgraceful.
@SenatorBurr You voted against background checks for gun buyers?  I'm embarrassed by you and your backwards, obsolete, gang of criminals.
@SenatorBurr You will have to live with that, being on the wrong side of history. Coward. Quisling. Dick.
@SenatorBurr - Shame on you. Those that require background checks and don't get them should be on your conscience!
@SenatorBurr You are a total disgrace to America. May your "vote" haunt you forever
@SenatorBurr you proud of what??? I will enjoy NOT voting for you in next elections.
@SenatorBurr Says he is proud to protect NRA profits at the cost of American lives. Betrayed 90% ppl in favor of background checks #stoprush
@SenatorBurr  Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? Coward 4 hire. #DemandAction
#NRA threatened @SenatorBurr w election backlash.But NRA's #GOP candidates R losing.He betrayed dead 1st graders for nothing. #DemandAction
@SenatorBurr You are a coward, Senator Burr. Best, Dylan Foley, New York City.
@SenatorBurr #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #Demandaction
Hey @SenatorBurr, thanks for valuing campaign contributions over people!

@SenatorBurr Shameful
@SenatorBurr you are a disgrace.
I pray for your soul @SenatorBurr for putting politics & NRA money above the lives of children. You enable crime & violence. We won't forget
Representing NRA, not NC.
“@SenatorBurr: The Manchin-Toomey Amendment has failed -- proud to defend law-abiding Americans' #2ndAmdt rights.”

@SenatorBurr cannot wait to vote you out of office. This bill did nothing to curtail the rights of gun owners.
@SenatorBurr You seem proud to vote against the will of the constituents you are supposed to represent. As a NC voter, I will remember this.
@SenatorBurr is a coward.
...but not victims of gun violence. RT @SenatorBurr Amendment has failed -- proud to defend law-abiding Americans' #2ndAmdt rights.
@pjsykes at least Tim Kaine and Mark Warner voted for this bill.
@shutupdude yea, I'm happy that VA is not partly to blame.
