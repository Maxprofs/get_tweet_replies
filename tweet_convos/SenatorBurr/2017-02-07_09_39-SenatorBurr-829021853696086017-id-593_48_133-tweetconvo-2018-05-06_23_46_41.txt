We want #'s!!! How many called in support? We're wide awake now sir, at full attention. We spoke & you didn't listen. UR Fired!
partisan bs ... how much money you need?
Have you looked at the damage DeVos did to MI schools? Of course not, blinded by the lovely $$ she was handing out. @BetsyDevos
This is a joke.  You're choosing party over the education of our children.  Be honest.
this is what 100k get you
Betsy DeVos wants to destroy public education. SHAME!
While making a personal monetary profit from the education of America's youth!
Unfortunately she cannot answer basic questions about education; you are just towing the party line. Think about the NC people.
Her family donated 200m USD to the GOP. This is what is important.
do you ever get tired of the endless stream of bullshit that comes out of your corrupt mouth?
NO she has NOT, she is NOT the candidate good for MY kids, Sir. NO 
She doesn't believe in public education. And she can't spell. She's very rich.But are you for sale? Would you sell your country
I typically support you but still can't believe you said this.
you don't have to kiss ass here I doubt Betsy DeVos can read
I think what you meant to say was ...dedicated her life to dismantling public education. Also she gave you $$$ #priorities
DeVos's has only one qualification for SOE. She gives thousands of $ to Repub candidates and causes. #She'sNotGoodEnoughForNC
NOOO!  As a teacher in public and private schools, a woman not familiar with basic legislation isn't ready to lead.
another Trump pick to reverse any progress we could have made in education. Right choice for wrong policy.
SHAME ON YOU. Hold a town hall if you have the guts. Counting the days until you are voted out of office. SHAME.
Here is some math that even Betsy Devos could do:  Trump + Russia = Treason.  What are YOU going to do about it?
your head is so far in the sand - all about the money you got
You know that she is horrible.  Why do you follow the party line with zero principles? @POTUS is a Russian plant. #LOCKHIMUP
Thank you, sir.  Your constituents in NC ask that you ignore the bullies &remember your NCGOP voters. We want 2 support U100%
she didn't even know the difference between growth and proficiency. We'll remember this at the next election.
Disgusting Insulting...it is your job to listen to your constituants....are you deaf?
She is horrible. She got the job through big donations and her brother slandering Hillary.  Disgusting.  Have you a spine?
really?
BULL! You are CORRUPT and an embarrassment to North Carolina
She has much to prove.  During hearing did not know the basic laws a first year ed. student would know.  Senate saw $$$$
lol, best crap ever
how has she improved education?  This is what we can expect from you last term?  Shameful.
Really?  She knows NOTHING  about public education.  Is that the best you can do?  You and Republican senate are a DISGRACE!
Really, Money Talks doesn't it .That's why you gave DeVos your vote,it's not about the children !
shame on you for supporting Sessions & DeVos in a disregard of NC/USA values & the will of your constituents. #no2burr
She is not qualified. If teachers need to be qualified, she should be qualified. Shame on you and your colleagues!
No, she bought your vote. We're very disappointed in you.
.@SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis You have failed us all. We, your constituency, will remember your deceit.
and put guns in classrooms in case a grizzly bear gets in.  Really? That's not normal thinking.
and #DeVos dedicated $$$$$ to your campaign---we get it Richard. North Carolina needs Senators that work for the people
congratulations on making a couple thousand for that vote
$43,000 isn't a lot of money to sell out the education system.
She obviously didn't know her job.  Don't tweet lies, please.
You know that she wants to destroy public education, even you know this.  How can you look yourself in the mirror each day?
How do you sleep at night, knowing you've hurt thousands of kids and their futures? #SHAME @SenatorBurr
why are you doing this to us.
not recusing yourself from voting on a candidate that directly financed your campaign...shame on you.  You are the swamp
I will take great pleasure in voting against you.  Boo u sold out hack


What a failure when we need per capita pupil spending for top flight teacher to student & peer to peer systems. 2022 is to long
You are a very bad person.
Ross' commercials were correct - you've made a lot of $ at the expense of NC citizens.
Choke on DeVos $. You're not about education. It's all about you and your donors.
how much did she pay you to tweet that?
The voters of NC don't agree. You're bought.
We will remember your active role in destroying our education system when you come up for re-election!
A life long registered Republican here who does not share your optimism that Ms. DeVos will be effective.  $$$$ wins bigly.
No she has not! That is an out right lie!
DeVos? FOR SHAME! A vote 4 unqualified hack, AGAINST 90% of kids. REPUBS=nonpatriots! Voters=watching. GOP=OVER. Nice legacy
Hope your grandchildren can afford private school....wait of course they can.
you are a joke.
contributions = her campaign donations. Her contributions to education are not worthy of comment.
.@SenatorBurr whoa whoa whoa she paid you $40k, she deserves more than 140 characters!!!! P.S. you will be removed from NC government.
nooooooooooo!!!!! She has no experience with the public school system.
Wait until you see what happens to the public school children in NC. Shes SO unqualified its amazing.
She is the most deplorable person to take on public education. She will dismantle a key US strength. And you are to blame
.@SenatorBurr Respectfully, I call BS. She has had ZERO exp with public education. She's a billionaire & you took her $. #Sad
why you lyin!!
Great Job Sen. Burr - We will continue to support your efforts in making our Country GREAT once again! Thank you!
How stupid do you think we are?
You have hurt my child, you will pay for this!!!
Don't listen to the people. Big mistake.
I am not. Public education is one of the cornerstones of America. You just took a whack at it w/ a sledgehammer. Shame on you !
do us all a favor and resign now.  You aren't going to run again anyway #dumpburr
You sold your soul! It's obvious Money talks. Shame on you. You don't deserve your title. #reapwhatyousew
shame on you for putting contributions above our children.
already stated '16 was his last campaign. Feels immune to his constituents. But @SenThomTillis shld be worried. Focus & #resist
We will see about that, Senator. We will see.
Help! NC @SenatorBurr is MIA! #resist
and I am glad to support anyone running against you... Your time is over  #TermLimits
DeVos knows nothing about public education. Private enterprise does not serve the people. Government serves the people, Sir. @SenatorBurr
So disappointed in you. #Soldout
She improved your bank account. Not sure about education though. Do you have evidence that she improved anything?
You took $43,200 from DeVos. Your vote is bought for the most incompetent candidate imaginable. Get ready for ADA lawsuits
Please help me understand why http://idea.ed.gov  will not load today. Surely all children includes special needs kids?
parents can make education better. It starts at home. Not as much a government issue as it is a family issue.
She has ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE WORKING IN EDUCATION! Stop gas lighting your constituents!
I will not let 1 penny of my tax dollars go to a private/religious school.  Our public schools should be the best in the world
but unfortunately the two schools she attempted to reform have failed miserably #horriblechoice
You let us down with your vote. My children desearve better than Betsy DeVos and you know it. #democracynotforsale
we won't forget this and you'll be gone next election.  So long Sold-Out Senator Burr
how did she improve the education in Detroit? Oh that's right SHE DIDNT. #senatorsforsale

I am glad my son graduates this year.  She will not work for the children only corporations
But you have not dedicated your life to improving education and the lives of children in NC. This choice is a reminder
She bought you and now we will resist. #impeachTrumpnow
She also gave you money. I sleep well and night knowing you'll burn in hell some day. Deep down you know it's true Burr. #greed
devos has dedicated her life to attacking public education and her weirdo Christian values
No sir! Betsy DeVos bought your vote. You make me sick!!
She's dedicated her life to buying influence. And she just cashed out at our children's expense. #burrisasellout
Liar.
Most embarrassing nomination ever. Zero credentials. You're embarrassing yourself and compromising my child's education.
- DeVos not qualified; as NC resident you did NOT rep. me; will do all I can to see you are not reelected!

.@SenatorBurr Fight for ALL children? R U sure about that? How about our minority, poor, & special needs children.  #DeVos
Nope. She dedicated herself to buying her way into federal govt but paying Senators like you. Shame on you Burr.
Seems money can by anything.
guess it didn't matter to you as you aren't running again.
my understanding was elected officials did the work of the people - money talks louder.
CONFIRM GORSUCH
You're delusional or a hypocrite, or both! And you have a big conflict of interest with $$$ from Betsy for your campaign.
improving for whom? The rich? She's never been near a public school. She pay you off too?
Do you even read these comments? Do you even care? Thank God my children are grown. My heart bleeds for all the others.
when? Show us the receipts!!! Sounds like another alternative fact. How bout that $43,200 receipt? #NoOnDeVos
only looking out for #1- your damn sorry self. You our GOP buds live it up now-your on borrowed time.
all about the cash  value! Nothing to do about the integrity of being a patriot and doing what your constituents wanted.
you are a sell out and a coward. DeVos has zero qualifications to lead the DOE You zero credibility of hold your seat. #resist
Very disappointing Senator. Your vote & support shows you know nothing about education & frankly don’t care about our children.
she also dedicated 43k of her money to you, I'm sure that impacted your vote. Motivated by children's needs or money? #crook
Betsy DeVos knows nothing of education, we all know your endorsement was bought. $ over children or will of constituents
GOP just submitted legislation that entirely dismantles the board of education by 2018. Fucking liar!
the resurgence of segregation will be on your head. *smh* I'm extremely disappointed
when u are up for     re-election this constituent will NOT be voting for u. #devos #sellout 
you just lost my vote. DeVos shockingly unqualified. dedicated her life to lining pockets of politicians for personal gain.
You don't have a spine and history will show that you were nothing but a coward scared of @realDonaldTrump
really? Show your work. I bet you $44k you don't have any valid data!
No.  She has dedicated her life to bribing republicans to support her,  though she doesn't understand or  support public ed
BS! She will be as terrible for schools as Trump is for America. The whole thing is a ticking time bomb.
When public schools in NC are hurt by this White House, we will remember your stand with DeVos.
as a constituent I am deeply disappointed in your vote
You are the worst, Burr. DeVos is a steaming pile of crap that has no business near public education.
I am sure the stocks of any for fee education just went up
Except children with disabilities. Their fate should be left to the states 
not the vote your constituency wanted #shame #townhall
She's the least qualified candidate in history & purchased your vote for $43,200. Don't pretend like you care about the kids
@mcaced looks like you will not have a job next ELECTION we we the people will REMEMBER. TRUMP LOVER
Dedication doesn't make up for lack of knowledge and experience.  Bad choice.
I see right through your rhetoric. DeVos is a horrible choice and you know it.
should be ashamed for allowing his vote to be purchased instead of voting to protect public schools. #CowardlyCongress
You should have recused yourself from voting due to her financial contributions to your campaign.
http://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/02/devos-burr-confirmation-vote-0207 …
so have I but I didn't have $43,200 to sway your vote.
DeVos family donated $43,200.00 to Burr's campaign.  Do not re elect this traitor. Remember this on Nov 06 17
never mind I found it $43, 200.00. She bought your vote. Shame on you.
how much did she donate to your campaign?
voting against you will be a great pleasure. Constituents won't allow a sellout to remain in office. Hope the $ was worth it
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF! Republican senators sold out a generation of children. The nation's doomed. Truly disgusted
are you high?
Richard Burr has dedicated his life to how much he can capitalize on his cozy relationship with special interests.
that is ridiculous.
You have voted against outcry from your constituents-We are supposed to be a democracy-Why aren't you listening to your people?
https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=hm-f3jab87U&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DM4CVZnGJIzQ%26feature%3Dshare …
you and @SenThomTillis have sold our children out. Last term. You're both out.
Here's a helpful chart explaining how Senator Burr decided a woman with no education experience should be Sec of Education.
You'll find the Senator up there in the top left.  Looks like he cost DeVos a pretty penny!
But hey, you're not up for re-election until 2022, so I guess you're just hoping we all forget but then right?
I continue to have no intention of voting for you when your time is up. You continue to let the people of North Carolina down.
She certainly improved your bank account #DrainTheSwamp #RESIST
- Funny that a guy who lied about where he went to college doesn't see the value of education. #hypocrite
I will never cast my vote for you again. You hose party over what's best for our country!
no, and start listening to your constituents, sir.
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
she had to offer was $2.5million to the Repub SUPA PAC. No experience, and our children and teachers suffer. YOU ARE A COWARD!
what a disappointment you are.
How DARE you vote against the best interests of our teachers. I'll be watching you the next 1,790 days of your political career
Congratulations you sold your vote. We said NO and YOU did not listen. Can't wait for your reelection bid.
that is a bold faced lie.
and she's done it so WELL!! 
wrong. All you care about is lining your pockets not our nation's children.
I fear for the future of our children... thanks to you and your horrible decision today. #VoteNoDevos
DeVos: “My family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party...we are buying influence,”
Shame on you. She's the worst candidate for the job; you've sold NC out & I hope that $$$ helps you sleep at night.
Well clearly you did not represent NC citizens wishes. Only your political agenda.
It would be so refreshing if you just owned up to your corruption. "She bought us. So what?" would be so much better to hear than this bs.
$43,200. #SpecialInterest #ShameYourSenator  #SELLOUT #GoodOlBoy
shame on you. It's not what you want. It's what you constituents want.
we see you, Burr. How do you sleep at night running such a corrupt game? How in the hell did this guy get re elected twice?!
You voted to confirm a person with NO qualifications for the job. Clearly, you are equally unqualified. This is your last term!
Agree
maybe she will give you a job after we vote you out for choosing politics and money over our children.
: Poor choice Senator!!! There are 100's of people that have dedicated their lives to education that are FAR MORE PREPARED!!!!
