A staffer (I think from gallery) grabbed it for safe keeping. So @SenatorBurr come get your bank card!
That damned awful press! They saved your card. But all you can think of is they didn't steal your pin.They should have left it there
Should probably have the bank check the key.log file data.
God, I love block.
Senator,Thank you for your service today excellent job. I'm a democrat from California and I feel you are serving the whole nation.
@LoopEmma Agree, Sessions should resign. If any one of us were caught with perjury, we'd be hit with 10 years in prison.
Lead by example. We are watching & learning.
So let me get this straight Comey breaks law by leaking memo. Clinton breaks law with server and u r still investigating @POTUS   Wake up!!
Material was not classified. Not a leak. Belonged to Comey, not FBI or DOJ. So not a leak.
Actually conversations with @POTUS r protected. Also memos done on @fbi laptop thus official govt documents. And he said he"leaked" them.
No. No executive privilege claimed by DJT. NOT confidential info as determined by executive level FBI and FBI attorneys.
Conversations between FBI and @POTUS r confidential. Guess u have never work for govt or n military. But hey we can't all b brainwashed Dems
R U & ur committee ACTUALLY debating whether or not the American people will hear Jeff Sessions testimony? Really?! Huge mistake 2 block us.
Sir, is Sen. McCain ok? He seemed very confused, suggesting perhaps he suffered a stroke. Hope he's alright.
Senality has set in. This is a perfect example why there must be Term Limits on all the crooks in Washington. Looks like a nursing home.
Which is worse? McCain substituting the word "Comey" for the word "Trump" two times -or- Burr losing his bank card?
You knew POTUS was not under investigation, yet you didn't speak up. I am SO disappointed in you! We elected him. Please have his back!

Reminder: Sen. Burr, who is leading the Senate intel cmte's #TrumpRussia probe, was also a Trump campaign adviser.

Public hearing. Otherwise no one will trust thus investigation. If anyone does now. Which I doubt.
Covering for Sessions? How much is Russia paying you?

Grandma left her purse Upon my vehicle trunk &. we drove off from a dark alley. 10 minutes later I got a call -- decent folks care.
Serve the country not the party. Shame on you for allowing these Trump shenanigans.
The American people have a right to hear Sessions questioned in an open hearing. Our democracy is at stake.
Shouldn't you subpoena Comey's friend to ask him if this is the first time he's leaked for Comey????
U leave your twitter unattended? so your kid got it?.. or POTUS LOL... SAD!
wow! Your tweets remind me of your twit ringleader's tweets!
Dick Burr?
Anybody seen Dick Burr's card?
#BurrMustRecuse #PartyOverCountry #SessionsMustResign
It is completely inappropriate for AG to appear before your committee to blow smoke at Comey's testimony. He is supposed to be recused!
You might need it to post bail soon
Here is something more important than that. Drop special council now and save taxpayers money after wasting so much time &$ wild goose chase
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/top-intelligence-official-told-associates-trump-asked-him-if-he-could-intervene-with-comey-to-get-fbi-to-back-off-flynn/2017/06/06/cc879f14-4ace-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.95b31ab5137a … have you read this? #obstructionofjustice! Plus he told Russians that he fired "nut job" to relieve..
He supports putkin/trump he's a traitor to the US why would he apologize? He's a republican the dying party can't wait for the defeat
burr remember has ruined his reputation by doing trumps bidding(nunes)Now he attacks smart dem women afraid of a Presid candidate voteHimOut
We don't have your pin but we do have your number. You owe @SenKamalaHarris an apology. #contempt #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #AMJOY
Now give @KamalaHarris back her due respect. How dare you bark at her like a dog? She was asking a "yes" or "no" question. #contempt #amjoy
Is the Senate IC pursuing an obstruction of justice investigation on trump?
Vote no on the AHCA.
Why did @SenatorBurr @MarkWarner not call @AmbassadorRice to testify?
Why is the Senate GOP crafting a healthcare bill, that will affect all of us, in secret & shoving it thru w/zero hearings? This is wrong!
REAL? Intel community>tape exists @SpeakerRyan discussing how Russian $ could be funneled without detection into @GOP campaigns? Yes or NO?
.@POTUS says he is 100% willing to testify under oath to try & defend himself against James Comey's accusations. Schedule this ASAP. 
Republicans get investigated. Democrats get Matter. Enough is enough. It's over.  We don't need any more investigation. Dump Muller
Lordy senator why did Comey  come to you any senator. Why did he go to @nytimes does he think American people are stupid. should be arrest
Could u find some time in your day to eek out some work for the taxpayer??
This is how Americans view the so called "intelligence services". Lots of looseness w private info of America. You retrieved your card tho
Sen.Burr , Thank you again for setting a tone for these hearings that everyone can respect. Sincerely, @Michael36776349
Was it 1-2-3-4-5-6?
That's how you thank someone for returning your card? Next time try a simple thank you.
burr is an ass
Fake burr
please stop embarrassing us - north carolinians are ashamed of you #getlostloser
Will u support trump testifying under oath? We deserve to hear his side under oath, especially since Trumps lawyer accused comey of perjury
Watched you censure K Harris while protecting Rosenstein's filibuster:Did ya dream as a kid of 1 day of betraying U$A to defend RUS puppet?
Just remember you owe @LoopEmma Senator. She may have a question or two she'd like answered soon. 

Well managed hearing today, Senator.
Stop kissing Comey ass, he disgraced himself today! We in NC are getting sick of your lack of loyalty to POTUS
Got his bank card back; but his buddy, buddy attitude toward Trumpanzee bleeds him of any integrity whatsoever. #ImpeachTrump
Having managed Visa card division, you may still want to get a new card issued.  Removes all doubt!
Will you be asking trump to answer questions under oath?
1 2 3 4. I have that same combination on my luggage.

Figure out what's important! You have waisted so much or our time and the US tax payers money!!!
From a bleeding heart liberal in California,  you're doing a great job with Sen Warner on the hearings.  It's refreshing.   Thank you both.
Senator from what I can discern so far, you seem to be a fair Republican on this committee. I as an American appreciate your efforts.
Politics aside (maybe they should be more often?), I enjoyed this little slice-of-life story about @SenatorBurr and his ATM card today.
I got my card back. Thanks for the help. Glad I made sure y’all didn’t see my PIN. https://twitter.com/LoopEmma/status/872888043937648641 …
@SenatorBurr thank you for the professional leadership today at the Comey hearing.
Good job today sir. We had our doubts about you but we know in the end you will be on the side of justice.
.@SenatorBurr & .@SenThomTillis VOTE NO on #Trumpcare #ProtectOurCare  Your constituents will suffer worse if this passes!
Russian VEB Bank card. Don't leave home without it.
Bosco?
Do you know where the Trump tapes are?  #TrumpTapes @DavidCornDC @ananavarro
Please Vote No on the Choice Act
Good thing Trump wasn't there, you may never have seen that card again.
