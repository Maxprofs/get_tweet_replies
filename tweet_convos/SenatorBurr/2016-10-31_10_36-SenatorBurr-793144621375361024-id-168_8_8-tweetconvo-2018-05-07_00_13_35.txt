The 87M+ Taxpayer's dollars wasted, should have been invested into fixing ACA. Smarter, less expensive.
Republicans wasted millions of Taxpayer's dollars Repealing ACA, instead of fixing ACA.
Let's not forget that Richard voted against this!
Thanks for showing how absolutely classless the GOP has become. Perhaps one of your family members should be threatened as such
Shame on you for promoting violence toward a candidate for president! Has no one in the GOP got a moral compass? Thugs!
How can you call yourself a leader of the people while wishing some one would shoot at one of the candidates for office? PIG.
I'm sorry but it was disgusting your language aimed @HRC. You should b ashamed of yourself.
too bad the GOP has done NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING to change/fix healthcare. 8 yrs reagan, 8 yrs bush, NOTHING
Oh, YOUR bottom line about cancer care is how to protect big pharma's profits. Who do you think you're kidding?

what you have said about sec. clinton is utterly disgraceful. I hope you are roundly defeated. You do not belong in public life
If you don't do your job on SCOTUS from a President elected by the American people it's time to elect someone that will. URDone

Should you be shot for apologizing about shooting Hillary Clinton? Discuss.
History will shine the same light on you as your cousin. Clueless and classless.
The Secret Service is coming for YOU for suggesting that Hillary be assassinated! #LockBurrUp #VoteRoss

"Someone has cancer, guess we better shoot them too."
I'm ashamed that you and @PatMcCroryNC represent my state in 2016 both of you belong in the 60's. Despicable men.Low character
http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/richard-burr-hillary-clinton-gun-owners/index.html … You can't "unsay" this. This is abhorrent and represents u & GOP well. Hateful, shameful, misled men.
This is how you resolve "problems"; the problem is that if things don't go your way you can't come to common ground. Unamerican
YOU "Sir" are cancer. Public servant?  Far from it. Shame

you are #pathetic
when I read the headline I thought it was comedian Bill Burr. Turns out it's senator shit-head. You're a failure as a human.
VOTE HIM OUT http://www.jackischechner.com/about-the-aca/ 
Burr what would your response be if you were spoken about in the same terms as you spoke about hillary. You lost my vote
And who censured this Burr fool. With your wealth, U don't care about coverage. Let Obamacare help the rest of us.
There you go again @SenatorBurr misleading your constituents w/parsed quotes. Deplorable, you! ;)
did you really suggest a shooting target be placed on our next President?  Hope you apologized to Hillary Clinton!
Put a target in Hillary's face and have target practice, that will help, mouth breather!
unpatriotic and disgusting. Shameful your comments on A presidential candidate. You should resign now!
I stand with those condemning your comments. Lacking in professionalism, integrity and any sense of actual humor or wit.

You know what else is a 'dangerous experiment' - inciting deadly violence against a Presidential candidate. Clean up your act.
@DeborahRossNC You are a stiff! GOP Burr Pledges To Block Clinton's SCOTUS Noms...Forever
Delete your account & resign! You're not a leader.
An apology for threatening @HillaryClinton isn't cutting it. You should lose your job. You are not ethical.
shameful & disturbing http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/31/politics/richard-burr-hillary-clinton-gun-owners/index.html …
Not nearly as dangerous as your funny gun jokes. If our state is fortunate enough, you're outta here come November 8
shame on you sen Burr... talking about shooting Hillary clinton. You watch people of NC burrrrr you to a big loss.
Targeting - what goes around comes around
Will you ever tweet something about what good you're doing in office? It's all whining about the ACA.
is it true u threatened Hillary Clinton today?
Yet you and your caucus leader, Senator McConnell, have done absolutely nothing about ObamaCare, well, but fund it.
@SecretService should pay visit to this Sen joking about Sec Hillary Clinton assassination
No....Republicans would put our HC back in the hands of insurance companies. Yes improve ACA but never ever gut.
You should be ashamed of yourself, what kind of person jokes about killing Hillary when you know someone in that crowd just might!!!
Burr says "PAY 4 MY GOVT healthcare and other Americans should die in the ER"
Your leaked conversation is disgusting!
you make a joke about assination, typical republican. You're despicable.
The fine people of North Carolina deserve better than your brand of representation #Bullseye #DemsTakeSenateBack 
Shame you didn't try to help wih Fixes for Obamacare like Medicare part B when ypu had the chance #Bullseye #Adios

You should be censured by the Senate for you outrageous comments on HRC and Targets. You are a man with Low Character-Shame!
What parent would even allow their child to joke about murder? This man is an embarrassment to the US Senate & UNFIT TO REPRESENT ANYONE.
