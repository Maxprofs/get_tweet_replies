You'll invest time and energy in a dog but not the education of children in NC? Phenomenal priorities there, Senator. #noDevos
They're good dogs, Kong
I bet they bring him his slippers *and* the newspaper!
I try to have a sense of humor just like you do
#failtroll #hack
Well, like @SenatorBurr once said...

You weren't in the room when it happened... 
may God have mercy on your soul for abandoning the children of NC #noDevos
maybe we should get him to do your fucking job since you don't know how.
why don't you root for your constituents? It's clear you don't. Agree to meet us at a town hall and hear us out. #BeBraveBurr
I am a NC voter. Please vote against the nominations of Sessions and DeVos.
*ahem* You are out of order, the business before this body concerns good dogs
pupper Burr gets 11/10 good dog but I can't get through human Burr's phone line :(
h*ckin frustrating
He'd bite your constituents if he was your dog.
You did not root for North Carolina when you voted for DeVos. We already raising money to oppose you in the next election
This tweet paid for by Betsy DeVos. #NoOnDeVos
too bad you're not rooting for us anymore. #NoDeVos #NoonDeVos
I'll be rooting for our children and for you to vote no on DeVos.
@SenThomTillis bought and paid for by #devos 43,200 and 70,200.@WomensMarchNC @ScienceMarchDC time to work against these two!
If you really love dogs, you will help release the #USDA #animalwelfare records held hostage by 45. #censorship #hsus #darkages
please vote NO on the Illprepared DeVos. This is America--  we can do so much better than her!
this dog is as qualified as DeVos! #JustSayNOtoDeVos
I see DeVos bought your vote for $43,200. Disgraceful! WE employ you not her! YOU will be held accountable for her perf!
With all of our issues and you're suddenly into puppies??!!
should have not aligned yourself to @realDonaldTrump if animal welfare is any concern to you.
Do not confirm Betsy Devos. You WILL NOT be a senator again if you do.
She is woefully Unqualified to lead education for our nation,
"You only get one chance to do the right thing"
$$$$$$$
Did he give you 100K to back him like DeVos???
how much were u paid to say this
I will be rooting for your opponent when the next election happens here in NC.  Shame on you for voting for DeVos
Please vote no on DeVos. R children's dreams & our tax$ should not be squandered

Please put the best interests of your constituents ahead of the forces blinding you to DeVos's incompetence. #StopDeVos
No to DeVos, for blatantly obvious reasons...
Vote for our children NO on DeVos, she is unqualified for the position!
Please vote NO on Devos! Put our N.C. children above party and money! #noDevos
This puppy will have a better education than our children. Save women from sexual assault too VOTE NO DEVOS
Orr, my dog was named for the bomber pilot in Catch 22. Waged tail for approaching friends, barked for strangers.
Often these dogs are blessed with the best qualities of the shepards & beagles. Worked in Human Society. Salukis & Inuit dogs?
please don't confirm Betsy DeVos. This is a really BAD idea. Better think cause your political career depends on it!
How about we root for public education and say No to DeVos?
vote NO on DeVos!
how about you listen to your constituents and vote NO on DeVos!
vote NO on DeVos
@ThomTillis @SenateGOP Please vote no on DeVos. #unqualified #SOS #SaveOurSchools #noDeVos #NCvoter
your office line stays busy
please do not vote for DeVos.
Sir, I beg you to put your partisan politics aside and do something about Trump's insane fear mongering and stupidity.
Does that mean anything to you? That I am fearful of living in my own country? That my president sounds like a Russian spy?
I really hope there are some secret meeting going on in DC right now to contain this lunatic. I am starting to get scared.
I'm rooting for democracy. I'm rooting that you listen to the people you represent instead of saying we were paid protesters.
That's cute, but could you please not vote for an unqualified person to lead the nation's education?
No on Devos.
Media blackout.
Vote Yes for DeVos
 Vote Yes ALL CHILDREN'S EDUCATION!
 NOT JUST THE WHITE ONES   #DeVos #FNS
Our Constitution is being systematically dismantled, I would hope you have more urgent matters to attend to.
, Betsy DeVos has bought you like a cheap suit, you are a disgrace to your country to support someone so unqualified.
this is what you think is important? I am a NC Voter and want you to vote NO!  #nodevos #nosessions *This is not a paid post!
NC - Is that a "NONSENSE CITIZEN" I seem to run into many of those
That is the face of a dog who just learned that you refused to vote no on DeVos. He's not sad; he just expected better of you.
Looking at perritos while we worry about the vote on DeVos. #VoteNoDevos
Please OPPOSE DeVos! She's the WORST choice for our schools. UNQUALIFIED, MISGUIDED, UNETHICAL. Please VOTE NO on DeVos!
if you vote YES 4 DeVos I will vote against U next election & donate to UR opponent.  I #TaketheDeVosPledge #DumpDeVos
I would like to know WHEN we are going to be told how much the trump admin worked with the Russians. National Security issue!
I am not paid to contact u. Taxes pay u to read this. Publish that u fulfill that obligation. Will accept invite to DC
DeVos --> Burr: $43,200
I live and vote in NC. Please vote NO on DeVos. I/we are watching, and will remember #PuppyBowl come reelection time.
I wish your u were rooting for North Carolina.
Also looks like a better candidate for Ed sec. Vote NO on DeVos.
Instead of focusing on football and puppies, how about focusing on the children of NC? Vote NO on DeVos.
. @SenatorBurr I am so disappointed in your lack of professionalism and concern for your constituents. You don't represent me. #NotoDeVos
of course you can cheers for puppy bowl instead of answering your constituents calls and emails
you do seem to like pedigree... vote no one DeVos and Sessions and do your JOB
Grrrrrrrrr. Vote NO for DeVos and get your mind off of the pups!
you call people using their voice a strategy?We saw the hearings! @BetsyDeVos is just as unfit for her job as trump. U know it.
An educator for 30 years, I've never been so insulted by your "Party First" mentality as I have been by the Devos nom.
I'll be rooting for you to vote no for DeVos. She is a D rated appt. Vote No. from your NC constituent. Seriously. Vote USA
, dogs?! When there are real issues like, Betsy DeVos, Muslim bans, conflicts of interest? Represent us 4 real.
I was rooting for you to listen to your constituents about DeVos. Hopefully that puppy sits in the corner chewing it's balls.
@SenBobCorker Please do the right thing for America's schools-vote no on Betsy DeVos#StopDeVos
But, I guess @SenatorBurr prefers to listen to $43,000 from DeVos family rather than the voices of the people he works for
okay- for real- that tweet made you the ONLY senator I like right now.  A+++++++++  I'll root for him too.
Vote NO to Betsy DeVos. America deserves a sec of education who understands public ed system and has no experience.
#PuppyBowl this dog would rather chew your a** than he would a dog biscuit. Good luck
I tried calling and got a busy signal. You don't want to talk with me? Whhhy? Please fix the phones so I can call yoooouuu!
Iâ€™ll be rooting for this Senator named Burr in the #VoteNoDevos nomination.
Burr thinks dissenting constituents are merely a cynical "strategy". Sen. Burr is a Trump lapdog.
When courts judge on extreme gerrymandering, bye, bye
If the dog faced the other direction, uncanny likeness to you.
CHILDREN BEFORE PARTY - if you listened to her confirmation as we did then you KNOW she is unqualified VOTE NO ON BETSY DEVOS!
how about you root for us America, stop the madness coming out of the Oval Office @POTUS @StevenBrannon VOTE NO deVos
This extremely adorable puppy wants you to vote no on DeVos.
you aren't seriously posting this when SILENT to your constituency regarding DeVos. Sad. NOT winning.
please don't vote for bad dogs Price and DeVos
vote NO on DeVos!!!!!
I'll NEVER vote for you again!!!
will you be needing a cry pillow as I don't think the government issues out those.
Prove to your constituents that you have integrity. Vote No on DeVos.
how about liking people!  You are making horrible decisions following president Bannon!
. @SenatorBurr is he also corporate sponsored by DeVos?
.@SenatorBurr I'm rooting against Betsy DeVos for Sec of Education. If you vote against her, I'll root for Burr. Deal? #noDevos
Also, altho dog= best friend, Russia is not our friend. Please fully investigate Russian hacking and any connection to Trump.
Cute puppy. Now please advocate for children of NC and vote no on Devos. She's highly unqualified despite being a big donor.
Dude, focus. We want you to vote NO on DeVos. You can watch puppy videos later (if our democracy doesn't collapse)
is this dog a loser too? Vote no on DeVos!
I have not seen one positive thing about DeVos! We in NC have tried to tell you to vote no. Please reconsider!
I'll be rooting for your opponent come election time.    Shame.
Seriously?!? Now is the time to be thinking about what's best for schools in NC. #NotoDeVos
hope it pissed on your shoe
Cute puppy. Looks like a better pick for education secretary than DeVos. #breadandcircuses #StopDeVos
looks can be deceiving. I know, you looked like a good guy but nah, sold your soul to the devil. Really, you did. #hellishot
no one cares about your puppy bowl pick but we WOULD like to hear you defend your horrible decision to vote for DeVos. Comment?
Vote no on DeVos! You were elected to represent your constituents, not take bribes for cabinet positions
several years ago Al Franken told me to hate this vapid tweet, regretfully #yourconstituent
meanwhile you show your lack of concern about US kids by voting for @BetsyDeVos to be Sec of Ed. You're spineless #RubberStamp
There is a white supremacist dictating international policy to your #GOP president.
@byrdinator how much did that puppy pay you? #PayForPlay #BetsyDeVos #GOP
@JoePerticone
Looks energetic.
He could be more qualified to be Secretary of Education, too! That would be my higher concern.
one highly paid pet supporting another #devosisunqualified
He looks like a dog who would vote NO on #BetsyDeVos. Don't let him down.
What a waste you are of taxpayer dollars.
#noDeVos
Even he knows to #VoteNoDevos
taking a break from your rubber stamp work?
this dog is more qualified than @BetsyDeVos. But you won't vote for the dog because it didn't give you any money.
In this political climate this is what you choose to post? Please talk to YOUR constituents about your DeVos vote. #noDevos
So glad you support this dog but not the thousands of constituents who want you to vote no on DeVos.
How about you root for the children of NC for voting no on @BetsyDeVos? I understand she contributed to your campaign. #bought
boughtandpaidfor #lapdog
And our children will suffer for it. @SenatorBurr @BetsyDeVos
Sir, glad you can worry about dogs and not KIDS! Vote NO on #DeVos and overturn the #MuslimBan. Rep & Dem, Americans demand it.
good 4 you.heads up.eur. thinks the USA is a threat.Russia is r friend! u r clueless.  thankfully @SenJohnMcCain  has r backs
cool. Now actually do something for your country. Get bannon off the nsc! He is a blatant threat to our country!
well that is important.
He's cute and all, but please more investigating of #trumprussia.  Less bashing your concerned constituents= also good.
Dude, enough of this nonsense and DO YOUR JOB. Listen to your constituents. They're telling you to #DumpDevos.
go do your job and vote against Trump's cronies.
How about you focus on stopping Devos from becoming Sec of Education?
I'll be rooting for you to vote against Betsy DeVos on Monday and do right by the people of NC.
please also root for the students of NC. They deserve a resounding NO on DeVos.
Sir, we don't care about the puppy bowl. We care about what DeVos would do to our schools. Please vote against her.
This is NC's tone-deaf senator who will shill anything and anyone for the right price, obviously. No VETTING required. #jerk
so this is the importance of you job with all that's going on in DC the #puppybowl  do some good vote no on DeVos do NC proud
Glad you took the time to tweet this, but don't have the time to listen to your constituents.  
nice you have time for this as our Democracy crumbles around us! #Indivisible #resisttrump #NotoDeVos @RISETogether_NC
Also? He's a better pick for Secretary of Education than Betsy DeVos, but alas, puppy Burr's family hasn't given you >$40,000.
Hey you should answer my email asking you to justify repealing healthcare for millions.

Signed, 

a concerned constituent
this is what you post?  You are getting calls daily and you can't even address the countless voicemails and tweets?  #pathetic
That would require accountability to the constituents he doesn't care to represent.  also #shameless #soulless
That dog is probably smart enough to not be Trump's dog. #impeachalready
Well, he's a lucky dog to make it safely to the end of Obama's term.

Without getting eaten, I mean. #ObamaAteADog
and I'll be rooting for you to  investigate #TrumpRussia #DworkinReport and #DumpDevos. Do the right thing!
are you going to bet your $43,200 on Burr?  How much did Pedigree pay you for this ad?
Will you also be rooting for Trump to nominate someone qualified for ed sec? Vote no on DeVos!
