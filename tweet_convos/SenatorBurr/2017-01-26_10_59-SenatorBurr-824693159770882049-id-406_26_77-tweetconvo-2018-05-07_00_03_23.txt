Vote for DeVos and you'll lose my vote next election. #StopDeVos
I hope you follow through with that promise @MELnc. @SenatorBurr is in bed with DeVos and has been for a while.
I will. Same crap caused our schools to use a crappy math vendor years ago - saleswoman was screwing the superintendent. 
Which year was this?! It would explain SO MUCH. @MELnc
It was in the early 2000's - before Barry Shepherd
fuck you. You threw our children under a bus today.
Yes he did. You knew she's one of his campaign contributors right? http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2017/01/30/devos-nomination-sen-richard-burr-cast-confirmation-vote-one-key-contributers/#sthash.7nsxj66c.dpbs … @ReallyTrish @SenatorBurr
I only have curse words. 
We have two years to get ready to vote @SenatorBurr out. I think McCrory needs some company.  @ReallyTrish
Yes he did. She basically bought his vote. http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2017/01/30/devos-nomination-sen-richard-burr-cast-confirmation-vote-one-key-contributers/#sthash.7nsxj66c.dpbs … @dawngeary @SenatorBurr
Your partisan support of Devos will be a lasting smear on your record.
You voted yes on DeVos? How can you sleep at night?! I guess $40,000 she gave your campaign helps huh? http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2017/01/30/devos-nomination-sen-richard-burr-cast-confirmation-vote-one-key-contributers/#sthash.7nsxj66c.dpbs … @SenatorBurr
DeVos is not qualified vote NO!
Protect & enhance SS & Medicare for 57M Seniors, who will not forget what you do! Meet with your constituents!
& DeVos bought your vote. She doesn't know IDEA & will hurt children
it's sad to see you celebrating advancement for kids like mine here but supporting harm for them today
Children with disabilities will be poorly served under DeVos.
Please vote not to Devos in Senate! She will take our community (#PWD) backwards not forward.
please don't vote for DeVos! Please speak up!
NC will remember you put party before our Children. @NCPolicyWatch @UniteWomenNC @ncnaacp
does NOT CARE about the THOUSANDS OF VOICES, whom he represents, tallied on record #VOTENODEVOS #BURRNOTFORCOMMONMAN
great job on voting yes on Devos!!! It's obvious you don't care about the education of students in North Carolina!!!
by approving Betsy DeVos you proved you don't care about any children You're a #worthless #TrumpPuppet & history will remember
Then you cannot support DeVos.
clearly you DO NOT GIVE A RAT'S ASS about ANY CHILDREN #DeVosconfirmation #PATHETIC
show us you truly stand with children with disabilities and vote against DeVos! #NotoDeVos
roday is also an important day for parents of children w disabilities. You sold them & your state out for @BetsyDeVos @TWW_NC
oh Sure - like you care whatsoever about children with disabilities. Your vote today shows that.
DO YOU EVEN LISTEN? Why would you run for office if you don't listen to your constituents
as is today! Betts Devis will NOT advocate for them! Shame on you, sir!
. @SenatorBurr you mean wealthy families of children with disabilities.
Yes, I bet it is. @BetsyDeVos really proved that during her conf hearings! #swampswampswamp
Not if Betsy DeVoss is education secretary! How could you pass her out of committee??
This tweet is interesting, seeing as you just voted to approve a Sec. of Education that doesn't understand IDEA.
Vote NO on Betsy DeVos!! PLEASE!
Don't act like you give a darn about those of us with disabled children. Your vote today gave our children the shaft!
You got to be kidding? You just let Betsy Devos clear Senate. Don't dare say you are for children with disabilities! @ncwu
please respect this important day with a rejection of DeVos!
too bad DeVos didn't even know what it was.
@SenatorBurr you don't care about kids with disabilities or otherwise. You just let NC down! #shameonyouforvotingfordevos
If my son with autism loses ONE THING in his education, I will blame you. Because YOU KNOW BETTER
You KNOW DeVos is horrifying and yet you lemur-ed right along because standing up for what is right doesn't compute.  SHAME
And so you sold ours down the river with the DeVos confirmation?  SHAMEFUL and YOU KNOW IT.  I could see it on your face.
you cared more about a donation from Devos than my kid with a disability and his need for quality public educ. Shame on you.
.@SenatorBurr You are a liar. Your phone rang off the hook. But Devos bought you through her superpac. You're disgusting. False witness.
if you support children with disabilities vote no on DeVos! #VoteNoDevos
Because profits are more important than children. https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/devos-questionnaire-appears-to-include-passages-from-uncited-sources/2017/01/31/50577dec-e7be-11e6-b82f-687d6e6a3e7c_story.html?utm_term=.806c24412067 …
you are selling America to the highest bidder. #ImpeachTrump
How much were you paid to say that? About $43k. #DumpDevos
vote no on DeVos, please, if you care about children with disabilities! #StopDeVos
Coward. Please do not pretend to care about U.S. children or education. We will not forget this.  #DeVosFacts
WHAT?! you just voted in a secretary of education THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS CAUSE!!!!!! #youletusdown
.@SenatorBurr if so then vote #NoOnDeVos! She is unqualified an many fronts and didn't even know about #IDEA
Thank you!  Now let's talk about IDEA and all of America's children
please vote against DeVos #StopDeVos
vote NO on DeVos!
Didn't Betsy's family give you a "credit" of $43K?
You can put a half-wit in charge of a lot of government agencies and get by,  but education is not one of them.
If you really cared about children with disabilities you wouldn't support Devos.
#BetsyDeVos is dangerous for our children and our future. Please vote NO! #StandUpToTrump
wouldn't it be a good Idea to have a sec of ed that knew what IDEA was #DumpDevos
She is not qualified.
Trump’s nominee for Education Secretary can’t answer basic questions about education policy. This is troubling. 
Are you paid for, senator?
Here's a fun list of those on today's Senate Education Committee who took $$ from Betsy DeVos 
@funder Yes -- he's bought & paid for by The DeVos family & others.

So the talk is nice but NC knows when your $$$ is on the line where your 'heart' really lies

#BetsyDeVos owns Amway-in 2016 their Russian offices were raided by FSB (KGB) #trumpleaks #DeVosHearing #rt #devosfacts #resist #resistoften 

#BetsyDeVos insured 800 Russian employees via Alfa Bank

TRUMP TOWER SERVER?

…
I ask because she will not defend the federally mandated rights of children with disabilities
Devos is a billionaire that doesn't care about students. Only rich PRIVATE schools. We know this on Mich.why we shot her down
religious schools, she can do so with private funds, not with our tax dollars.
did you abstain from voting Betsy DeVos thru HELP this morning? She did donate $5400 to advance your political career
We will not allow her to fail our nation's students the same we she failed students in Michigan. If she wants to support
You ignore constituents and do what you want to do, good luck getting re-elected.
No, Senator, the opposition is not due to "democrat strategy," it's about protecting our government from unqualified zealots.
You can spin it any way you'd like, but she has refused to answer key questions. Her ethics are questionable.
Your vote will destroy public education.
Yes, Dem Senators decided a week+ ago when Devos showed she was unprepared for the job. You can't believe your own words.
Vote NO on DeVos - she's unqualified.  If you care about kids with disabilities - she's a nightmare. Protect our public schools. Stop lying.
is a hypocrite and a liar. #shameonyou #VoteNoDevos #StopDeVos
puts donation $$$ over children's education #disgusted #StopDeVos #VoteNoDevos #ShameOnYou
@BetsyDeVos - this is not about her character.  This is about her lack of qualifications and huge conflict of interest.
We don't oppose Betsy DeVos because she is a Trump appointee. We oppose her because she is not qualified.
Vote no on Devos, nearly all of us in your district know she is a destroying of education. You represent us and need to vote "NO"
You are a failure and voters will remember that.
