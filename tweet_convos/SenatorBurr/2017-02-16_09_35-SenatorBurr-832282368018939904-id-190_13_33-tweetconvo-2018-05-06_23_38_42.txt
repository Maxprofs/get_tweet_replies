Greedy GOP! U stole our election-It looks like a repeat of the Coolidge/Hoover '29 Market crash. Power is a an addictive drug!!
#DoYourJob
Burr and Spicer pushed back on CIA intelligence. Remember NC!
Independent investigation of Russian connections to the President! Sessions must recuse himself! Do your job!
Even George W. Bush wants an independent prosecutor. Do the right thing and make this an independent investigation.
What do you know about doing what's right Congressman?

Burr don't worry we'll prosecute you alongside your best friend #Trump & Co just like Nazis at Nuremberg
Chairman of the Investigative Committee can do something when the cause is right. Be an example yourself. Do the right thing.


You're making a big mistake trying 2 quash Russia/Trump scandal. When transcripts start coming you'll B left holding the stick.
Senator Burr is it right to ignore the MANY conflicts of Interest this president has?  You ALL have ignored them
You have a "right" cause now to look into Trump/Russia, but instead you compromise yourself by asking IC to deny stories.  SAD!
your collusion will neither be overlooked nor forgotten! INVESTIGATE!

RESIGN
Your need to step down after trying to protect Trump/Russia/Republican party.  Your a disgrace!!!
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION! You, sir, are tainted.
Hey, are you #ABLE to show up to that town hall meeting the state you represent wants?
Resign!
Reply to @SenatorBurr Mr. Burr is a disgrace to United States Senate.

http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article134969844.html …
The cause to protect USA frm Trump/Russia isnt being done. Colluding to try and derail investigation is treason.
Party politics before country is absolutely unforgivable.
you were supposed to represent the American people not put out fires for Donald Trump! I think you should resign!
Trump's @gop is infested with crouching hand-lickers. Stand against tyranny, @SenatorBurr, or assume your role in it. History is watching.
Burr "reimbursed" himself $10,000 on 11/10/16
Round number for travel? Investigate #trumprussia @dailytarheel @OfficeGovEthics
It all comes back to North Carolina...just ask Louise Mensch.
.@SenatorBurr @dailytarheel You tried to help cover up Trump's Russian collusion? And you are on intel committee?You deserve to be in prison
I demand an independent, transparent Russia/Trump investigation. Nothing less is acceptable.
The cause is right: contacts with WH, leave the investigation. New one investigation needed. Sessions needs to step away.
Sir, did you say Clinton should be shot?  I know you will do right thing= recuse self from investigation
You are clearly incapable of being unbiased & leading a fair investigation of this corrupt Pres. I hope it's worth your job .
You're going to at the very least remove yourself from the committee I hope. You should lose your job!
you have been compromised, recuse yourself from the trump/Russia investigation or call for a special prosecutor
underpaid workers can't afford to buy healthcare. Either increase min wage or expand medicaid or both.
do you want to help disabled people? Pls inform @NCGOP to expand medicaid. Their ability to work is limited.
Bought and delivered by #45.
You have NO conscience so don't pretend to have one!!!! The cause is honesty which you  can't even identify with!!!!!
hey, you're acting as a pawn for the #Kremlin and we know it now. Yikes... Not looking so good for your future here bud.
this bum needs to be heckled and protested everywhere he goes. From candy store to office. He's a traitor!!!
Resign
You put party over country, Sir
Scrape together some of integrity & resign
#CountryOverParty 
#Indivisible
@MonsterMarcia @SenatorBurr @dailytarheel   Why don't u guys do ur job!  We have half a cabinet!!  Leaks,  Mr Burr, u there?
collusion w/ Orange Joke=collusion w/ Russia=treason. I don't hear you speak out against WH press ban-unpatriotic how much?
You're the opposite of integrity. You're obviously biased. Does Russia have dirt on you too?
Sooo trying to cover up #russiatrump Looks like you are being paid by Russia too
How does it feel to sell your soul to the devil in the name of politics? Covering up Trump/Russia. Shame on you
@MSNBC your name came up tonite...not good..RESIGN
This is criminal!#Shame on you!
We need an #IndependentInvestigation! #GOPFAIL
YOU need to do what's right!

You obviously have zero objectivity when it comes to Trump. Step down from the Intelligence Committee. Now.
Commission coming Senator.

Remember 

2018  2020

Reply to @SenatorBurr Senator your job is to investigate Trump and defend our democracy, NOT cover up his crimes!!! You're CORRUPT!!!
Resign
.Hey team GOP.guess team America isn't a priority.Any1 can see a mentally unstable president is piloting the plane
"The decision to involve those officials could be perceived as undercutting the credibility of ongoing congressional probes."
As per Rachel Maddow - why did you tell the press that there was nothing to the Russian connection with Trump? Not good.
u should be ashamed.  Resign now for your inappropriate behavior! U r going down too!!  #CORRUPTION
So u got suckered into telling the press that there was nothing to reports of 45 & Russia? How's it feel to be a liar/traitor?
Burr, resign now as you were a part of attempts on "obstruction of justice" in the Russia affair. You no longer have any creds.
Burr was enlisted by Trump admin to counter russia stories w/news organization ! In washpost
care to comment on the WH contacting you to keep quiet about Russia??

The man answering your Wilmington line was very rude when asking about Town Halls. (800) 685-8916.
Ready for a Town hall meeting. Stop hiding
When are you holding your town hall? Your constituents would like to speak with you.
Town Hall? This week was designed for Congress to come home and see your constituent. Are you fund raising instead?
When is your next Town Hall? Cabarrus county wants to attend.
You work for us! Protect ACA!
senator Burr works for himself and does not care what his constitutes want. He gets money from insurance co
When is your town hall?
You want to take away our medical insurance while we pay for yours? Unfair!

Protect and improve ACA!
Great cause for sure but there's so much to talk about back in NC.  When is your next #TownHall ?

Meeting directly with your constituents is an example of what you MUST do when all of your causes have been wrong
why are you hiding from us? You need to meet with your CONSTITUENTS BURR.
Proud of the work your doing on the Intel Committee regarding Russian interference  with our elections.
Didn't you take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution? Then why is the Russian coup still in the WH?
the cause of kids with disabilities getting education under IDEA was not right enough to you to say no to DeVos?
No, but $43,200 was enough for him to vote yes.
Wow! Sold USA cheap! Should have asked for more $$$  #Trumprussia AND you say UR Patriotic?
I appreciate this bipartisan effort-I would like to see more of this!
What about IDEA? In regard to education, what will NC be doing for children with disabilities in our state?
A cursory look sounds like a good thing; but, I've never doubted you probably had a heart commingled with good sense.
Thanks! This tool helps many w/Autism and ASD.  Now NC colleges must catch up on ASD support programs
Stop everything until Trump, Comey, Russia investigated. Be a hero.
Mr. Burr i voted for you on Nov 8th and you work for ME in NC we of NC wants a town hall please make time Thks
I hope it's true what we hear, ur going to keep pressure on finding out how Russia interfered in our election process& w whom!

I called your office for when and where a town hall would be next week. Told you have nothing scheduled to meet with people.

it's all "right" or "wrong"? This statement reveals a lot about how you think.
when is the townhall sir?
I just sent a letter to Mr. Burr concerning our new president. It's time to look into this administration!
Attach letter, 100$ and rock. Throw through his office window. Repeat until he answers.
We DEMAND immediate an INDEPENDENT Commission on Russian Espionage & Collusion ("committee" investigation = bury)
ANYONE who blocks an INDEPENDENT Investigation into Russian espionage/collusion is accesory & co-conspirator to the cover up
Great when is your next town hall meeting?
Please tell me you watched that press conference. For Gods sake, put politics aside and save us from this madman!
There needs to be an independent & transparent investigation into Gen Flynn's actions & the Trump admin's knowledge of them.
Thats great! When is your next town hall so we constituents can discuss other issues that affect NC. #TownHall
you right we need a town hall@SenatorBurr @dailytarheel
