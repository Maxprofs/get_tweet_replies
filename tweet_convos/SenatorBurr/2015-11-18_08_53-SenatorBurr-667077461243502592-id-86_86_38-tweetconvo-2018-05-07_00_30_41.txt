@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse if potus closes guantanimo...these criminals will be in high security prisons
@souzi54 @SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse Why burden tax payers? These scumbags are war criminals and dems/obama want to reward them.
@TheMagusX @SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse i wonder how much taxpayer $  are being spent on guantanimo
@souzi54 Point is they should NOT be on US soil period. Obama has already released far too many back to Middle East-joining terrorists.
@TheMagusX guantanamo costing taxpayers 2.7 million per prisoner a year...too expensive
@souzi54 We've exhausted this banter. You for some reason favor closing Gitmo. I am strongly against it. Ill wager you voted twice for Obama
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse koch driven rep agenda is the new fascism...you mitch are the biggest fascist of all
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse you're like a junkie ...addicted to dirty koch money
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse hey mc connell why are you wasting taxpayer $...2.7 million per prisoner per yr keeping that hellhole open
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse mcconnell you have shown your loyalty to the koch bros...w/ your 51 votes to block all legislation
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse @crimsontide0610 @lindseygrahamsc is a terrorist,expel him from the Senate
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse hey mcconnell did the koch bros ...your masters fund this ad
@SenateMajLdr, You cite Lynch asserting @POTUS will sign a law blocking this activity. Stop fearmongering and do your job. #WorstResponders
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse wrong to say terrorism of the ISIS kind has 'nothing to do with religion':
@SenateMajLdr @bluedevildavey @WhiteHouse [What is it you intend to do about that @SenateMajLdr? #ImpeachObama or just talk _ _It?]
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse Impeach Barack, have him arrested. Stop this craziness.

@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse Also, the first guy, you guys told us, was Saddam Hussein when you captured him. So, where is Saddam Hussein?
@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse So, what are you doing about it?  Congress, not the president, has the authority to deal with these.

@SenateMajLdr @WhiteHouse Ill donate the rope
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse Why is the #SpinelessGOP allowing this?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs They should be relocated to @WhiteHouse South Lawn to work on the @Flotus garden.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse Those prisoners are our responsibility even if they are bad they are still common people manageable
@SenateMajLdr @elitecretemw @WhiteHouse let them live in the WH with Barry, Michelle and their kids...its OK then.

@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse If only 0.19% of Syrian refugees are terrorists, that is how many people carried out 9/11 attacks.
@SenateMajLdr doesn't believe that American Military is capable of keeping these guys in a cell.  What a dick!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse Also wants to play #RefugeeRoulette. It has been proven they can't be vetted.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse Why is Congress letting us be exposed to this? What are your plans?
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs @WhiteHouse 

And/or military police?
