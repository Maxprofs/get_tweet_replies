@SenatorBurr Saw that you collected $800,000+ from the NRA.  Was that your sudden privacy epiphany?
@SenatorBurr, Thank you!
@PoppaWillie @senatorburr the DEMOCRAT senator who wrote the bill admitted that it wouldn't have stopped sandy hook
@PoppaWillie https://www.theinnoplex.com/news/newssub/manchin-gun-control-bill-wouldnt-have-stopped-newtown …

And there are more than that. Btw, @SenatorBurr gets my vote for re election. Hagan will not.
@SenatorBurr thank you for standing up for americans rights. Keep us free
@SenatorBurr Thank you, Senator. But you voted to bring the bill to the floor and are responsible for anything that passes. #Protect2A
@SCF @SenatorBurr  That's right Senator...
@SenatorBurr stands against the will of the People & sides with @nra to protect terrorists & criminals to have unfettered access to guns
@SenatorBurr name one.
@SenatorBurr I would like to hear 5 of them. I only heard that vet's w/mental issues should keep theirs.
@SenatorBurr You have just supported the rights of killers to buy guns as easily as candy bars by not supporting background checks. #NC
@SenatorBurr Were paying attention and holding you accountable. No matter what changes they make VOTE NO. http://youtu.be/zuTCb-HDQYM  #haction
@SenatorBurr You have your head/brain in the mud.  Man/Toomy do not attack the 2nd adm. How can you vote against what 90% of Americans want
@SenatorBurr, very disappointed and won't be voting for you.
@SenatorBurr If your college child was murdered by an unstable person allowed to buy a gun would your love of the 2nd comfort you? #VPI
You're an idiot "@SenatorBurr I have numerous #2ndAmdt, due process & privacy concerns abt Manchin-Toomey & will vote against it."
@SenatorBurr Thank U 4 protecting law abiding citizens of NC &4 voting against gun registration . #P2 #tcot  @NCTeaParty @NCHouseGOP
@SenatorBurr and I have many concerns about you being in office
@SenatorBurr Shame on you sir, you have misrepresented 90% of the country by refusing to support background checks.
@SenatorBurr SHAME ON YOU !
@SenatorBurr Shameful. Will NOT vote for re-election. Tremendously disappointed.
@SenatorBurr you towed the party line and satisfied those who line your pockets while failing to consider the overall safety of Americans.
Very disappointed in Burr RT @SenatorBurr I have numerous #2ndAmdt, due process & privacy concerns abt Manchin-Toomey & will vote against it
@SenatorBurr Your actions speak volumes. You have blood on your hands and gun money in your pockets, Richard Burr.
@SenatorBurr Your concerns should be about people who are being slaughtered, not your re-election & NRA backers. Shame on you.
@SenatorBurr BE strong! We cannot depend on the police to arrive on time. We need to protect ourselves!
@SenatorBurr Thank you senator, it took courage to stand up to the media and the president.
.@SenatorBurr Your position is shameful. #ncgov #NowIsTheTime
Thanks Senator MT“@SenatorBurr: I have numerous #2ndAmdt, due process & privacy concerns abt Manchin-Toomey & will vote against it. "
@SenatorBurr Thank You and GOD BLESS :)
@SenatorBurr Thank you Sir.  Please work towards sensible solutions that actually protect the people and #Protect2A
@SenatorBurr YOU ARE DEAD WRONG.  Vote for gun control and represent the will of the people of the United States. #YESguncontrolbackground
@SenatorBurr As a constituent, I strongly disagree with your position. 92% of Americans support background checks. Please reconsider.
@SenatorBurr not cool, not safe, and against human policy. Gunsense is human issue, not Dem or Rep. Human. #Newtown
@SenatorBurr This vote protects terrorist from background checks, as a Vet i underwent background checks b4 issued a weapon. U R afraid NRA
@SenatorBurr even though the majority of your constituents support some form of gun control. I guess you don't care about that/reelection.
@SenatorBurr PLEASE GET YOUR COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME!!! #tcot #tgdn @GOP @SenKirk @DickDurbin
@SenatorBurr Manchin is well liked in W Va, but won't be if he passes his bill.  want to talk about people who have guns. serious in Wv
@SenatorBurr Good Senator.  Convince your friends to do likewise, and say HELL NO to this.  Stop the Legislation now.
@SenatorBurr Thank you.
@SenatorBurr Sorry your ideology is blinding you to the ever-increasing nmbr of human tragedies enabled by easy access to WMD's in the U.S.
@SenatorBurr thus you should have not voted for the motion to move forward.
@SenatorBurr Thank you very much! Many of us share those concerns.
@SenatorBurr Thank-you so much

@SenatorBurr Thank You!  So tell me please, why did you, Alexander (TN) and Corker (TN) vote to bring it to the floor?
@SenatorBurr elaborate.
@SenatorBurr So disappointed you will not support universal background checks, which do not infringe 2nd amend rts. Pls. reconsider.
@BigSheepBiz @senatorburr people kill people not guns! Bombs are outlawed and still people kill with them!  Plse reconsider your opinion!
