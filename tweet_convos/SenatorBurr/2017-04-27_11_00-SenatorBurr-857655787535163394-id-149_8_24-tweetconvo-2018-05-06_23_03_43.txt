Never Forget 

Burr and Nunes called reporters to STOP stories about Trumps Russian Ties.

What are they hiding?
I solemnly swear  to uphold the laws and NEVER say a negative word against Mother Russia.
#TraitorInChief 
We havent forgotten. We know he's a trump flunky.
Ur doing what to help their education re: funding?
Russian history?http://www.bluedotdaily.com/richard-burr-protects-trump-from-scandal-probe-then-his-russian-financial-ties-surface/ …
How do you explain the President's disdain for US constitution?
Did you share the part about how senators are bought and paid for by special interest groups? Yeah, guess you didn't.
Now that you've gutted education spending along with everything else these kids need- are you going to be teaching them school as well ?
Flat tax of 10% of all income with no more deductions.  Equal tax rate for all citizens to avoid discrimination and economic slavery.
Vote NO on Trump Care -  20 Million Americans Lose Health Coverage - Preexisting Conditions Penalized - More of Comrade Trump's Lies
Where are we on the treason investigations? A statement, please?
"Kids, in this building we Senators accept giant campaign contributions that preempt your current and future needs. Y'all go back home now."
I cannot wait for midterms lololololololol
Do your job, special prosecutor for what really happened with our current POTUS and Russia. This is not a partisan issue.
Did you tell them how you're getting paid off to shut out your constituents? #Trumprussia #TrumpTaxes Vote NO #AHCA
#OBSTRUTION - throw away the key on the #GOP ! The People are coming.. #Revolt #MarchForTruth #traitors #treason #Complicit
You should let them know 80% of them will not have healthcare. Vote Down Trumpcare! Medicare for all.
Did you tell them about your collusion with Russia? Every student in the future will tie your name to Benedict Arnold.
"And in 2017, Congress had the chance to INVESTIGATE the president's corruption, but there were complicit Cmte chairs that protected him..."

Tell one about "git my gunz" & join armed revolution (re-hash Civil War), hillbilly boy! Drumpf/Burr, did Davis bumfuck Calhoun, too?
You will go down in history as an obstructor of justice and a destroyer of our democratic system
Did you read the AHCA? I was not aware "Draining the Swamp" involved the  elimination of the elderly and genetically undesirables. VOTE NO!
Awww. Russian to see the little ones.
Like maybe the Trail of TEARS + Civil WAR? GOOD because #trumPIGnorance is dangerous! Can't wait for an arrests indictments impeachment or?

The world has changed & if instructions for your work can be written, the job is insecure. Sports & entertainments become the most secure.
Here's something they will be learning about in the future: how you obstructed investigation into the biggest scandal in US history.
more sense now, tax & bank recs prove collusion & RICO on Drumpfs & Cyprus Wilbur, you & Devi guilty as Pence of aiding & abetting treason!
Current history: Drumpf starts denying Putin hack on Re-Face the Nation, "I know how to TWIT can't prove hacks" again. No subpoenas making..
Are you teaching them Russian?
Senator Burr, you shld recuse yourself from Trump/Russia invest. You have no intention of doing a proper & complete invest!!
The MOST IMPORTANT JOB YOU HAVE IS THE TRUMP/RUSSIA INVEST. What are you HIDING??
Lead !!!!! Or GET OUT OF THE WAY !!!!

Here's some history of ur #russiagate of ur own does @FBI know?
Time to provide information about trump's illegal activities to intelligence agencies. We must clean house. Traitors among us. #trumpRussia

There's no arguing this. My fellow conservatives would be psychotic with rage if this were any Dem, not just Hillary. https://twitter.com/funder/status/858078248256798721 …
You have more important things to do. Investigate trump/Russia. You know, the one that has 2 grand juries convening. Not long for trump OR U
Recuse yourself. This will be a career ender if you don't stop choosing party over country. You're a traitor!
Did you tell the kids how we defend America, not Russia?
Only a traitor would try to block or slow down investigation of Trump's ties to Russia.
Enjoy it while you can, Burr, you are on your way out with the rest of the Russian cabal!  Obstruction, collusion, treason.
Could you share a little with your 'boss'?
The money you too from devos is more than the average teacher assistant yearly salary
There should not be teachers who have to I've paycheck to paycheck or teachers on welfare and food stamps
Talking to kids knowing damn well what's about to happen to our schools.
History will not be kind to you.. nor will a lot of people in North Carolina.. you sir should go down as well
Did you tell them how you took 43k from devos for your vote when we rank near the top of states who have the lowest paid teachers?
Did you share your history of taking $ from Squire Patton: lobbying firm of Russian bank Gazprombank #BurrMustRecuse
And one day someone will tell students about #TrumpRussia and how justice was obstructed by those w/financial interests in Russia.
We would have liked to see you at a town hall
More info is coming out about Burr's own ties to Russia. That's why he is blocking any Senate investigation. #russianpuppet
Traitor
Please do your job - and seek the facts and go wherever they lead.
@MarkWarner 
#TrumpRussia #Trump #SenateIntelligenceCommittee
You are obstructing justice, making yourself complicit in #TrumpRussia.  How deep is your involvement?  Recuse/resign.  #DoYourJob
sharing history with kiddos is great but make history and a future for them and NC We need to BUILD THAT WALL ...do not wait
Poor kids
Sen Richard Burr got $8.1M from McConnell's Super PAC in September 2016. Same PAC that got millions from pro-Putin Ukrainian #BurrMustRecuse
Sen Burr, please know that future US History books will not be kind to u if u continue obstructing #TrumpRussia investigation. Put  first.
How about an update on the Trump/Russia investigation?  Witness list?  When are you going to ask Flynn for testimony?
and now we know why you refuse to investigate..
Docs: Senator Richard Burr has $20K+ invested in oil drilling co—that partners w/Russian oil co in the #TrumpRussia Dossier #BurrMustRecuse 
We MUST HAVE an Independent, Non Partisan Investigation into Donald Trump's emoluments and links or collusion with Putin!
How much longer do u think u can keep the shenanigans up? Get on it so Trump gets distracted from playing with N Korea before we get nuked!
Will Burr's history now include his willingness to cover-up  Flynn, Russia, and all the other criminal activity as he seemingly suggested?
It's high time for @SenatorBurr to call for an independent #TrumpRussia investigation.
You must either greatly accelerate the Russia investigation or recuse yourself from it ASAP.
You should be working 24/7 investigating #TrumpRussia.  Many Americans don't feel protected by this mess.
Like the time you took RUSSIAN OIL MONEY to obstruct Trump's treason investigation?
Biblical or historical?
History is not going to be kind to you, Senator. 
Recuse or Resign
#TrumpRussia is not going away (and neither is #TheResistance).
And what Mr. Burr will you be remembered for in history? Will you choose your oath?
Do your job as chairman of Senate Intel and investigate Trump/Russia. If you cannot/will not--resign immediately. No more BS.
Burr should not be teaching anyone. He should go hide. Trump take care of him. After all he is Trump's whore. Stalling investigation? Why?
Are you telling them about your very own kompromat & how you are single-handedly sabotaging the Senate Intel investigation of #TrumpRussia?
And what will history say about you regarding the Trump collusion investigation?
What is Burr not scared of? Kids. What is he scared of? Constituents and investigating Trump #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #Burrmustrecuse
You need to RECUSE yourself from trump/Russia investigation now!!!!!!!!!
How about meeting with constituents to discuss health care, environmental protection and the Trump/Russia connection?  Work for us!
you should be ashamed of yourself - #doyourjob -or better yet just quit
the history that's left behind after your gone will be Treasonous
Why are you colluding with Russia against Americans?
Nice but how is your senate committee investigation going?  Or is it still stalled?
How's that Trump/Russia investigation going?
#RussiaGate includes @SenatorBurr @POTUS and ALL the GOP! Robbing thieves and #traitors #EveryDamnOne!!!
The People of NC should tar and feather @SenatorBurr before running his ass OUT OF THE STATE!! #GetHim! #LockHimUp! #JailForRichardBurr!!!
I warn you that if you choose to voice support for the FCC repealing net neutrality, you will certainly lose your seat.
Nice photo op. Not impressed. That's only a part of the job. Listening to the ones who voted is the other. #doyourjob #moralresistance
It used to be that you had to nominate reasonable people to get the votes needed.  But we got rid of that.

Too bad you are going to be on the wrong side of the history books eventually Senator.  Obstruction of justice it's called. heard of it?
WE DEMAND An #IndependentInvestigation  #BurrMustRecuse-he was on team Trump  IT'S OUR RIGHT TO KNOW...tell them about your russian hx!
we need that investigation ASAP you poor excuse of a fungal infection
TREASON
After months of internet speculation, we finally found out why that Russian billionaire was in North Carolina http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article141308758.html#storylink=cpy … 

Stop obstructing the Russian Treason Investigation-you get money from the RUSKIES, don't you??????????????????????????????????


burr burr burr burr burr burr burr


Most under-reported story: Number of Koch pawns–Nunes, Burr, Cotton, Rubio, Blunt, MConnell interfering/stalling Trump-Russia investigation 
@OfficeGovEthics @SpeakerRyan @jasoninthehouse 
Sessions committed felony perjury & Kushner lied on his security forms.  PROSECUTE THEM!
Thats great however perhaps explaining why you aren't  responsibly doing your job in investigating Russia/Flynn/Kushner. Please explain that
Is it the history of how conservative positions have been historically overturned on almost every issue except Prohibition?
did you tell them how you respect veterans but refuse to do your job and that you're nothing more than a #RubberStamp
Did you tell them about the time you stalled an investigation into a foreign power meddling with our elections? #BurrMustRecuse
Be nice if you could do your job and do the #TrumpRussiaInvestigation 

#DoYourJob
That is really cool, now would you get back to DC and investigate #TrumpRussia?
We need to see movement  on the Russia investigation. If you can't get it done because of your own ties with Russia then Recuse or Resign!
Do you job with Trump/Russia or YOU might be history!
How's the investigation into treason going? Did you say anything about "country over party" to the students?
Real history?  Or propaganda?
You can tell them all about the time you obstructed  justice while you were running investigations 
I, like most Americans trusted you about seriously investigating #trumprussia   Have you no shame sir? Do your job   Country over party

I wonder how many of those kids are on Medicaid and will be kicked off in 2020? Vote no on #AHCA
Do your job, quit with the partisan BS. Put Country  over Trump
@SenatorBurr is bought and paid for by the Koch brothers.

They are all #complicit in #TrumpRussia coverup.
Most under-reported story: Number of Koch pawns–Nunes, Burr, Cotton, Rubio, Blunt, MConnell interfering/stalling Trump-Russia investigation 
And when you're a politician you can break all the rules and not be punished for your actions?
Did you tell them only rich people get represented in Washington?
NC residents:important thread on Alevo battery co in Concord, Russian oligarchs looking to hijack eastern power grid
Burr's obstruction: remember when Ryblovlev went to NC supposedly to see Alevo? https://twitter.com/McClatchyDC/status/847133759052922882 …
W was reading  a story 2 2nd graders as 911 happened.  Well Russia is happening right now, and you are doing the same shit.

#DoYourJob
That's great!  Now how about meeting with people in NC who are old enough to vote?  When's the town hall?
Will you be discussing how you are obstructing the biggest investigation in American history to shield Trump?
