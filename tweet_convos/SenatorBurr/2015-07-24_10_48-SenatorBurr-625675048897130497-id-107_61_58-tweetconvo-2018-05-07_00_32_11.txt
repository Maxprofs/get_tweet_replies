Waiting lists are even longer now than they were during last year’s waiting list scandal. http://j.mp/1LtJEJr  #VA #veterans
Only 3 lower level employees were successfully fired for wait time manipulation at heart of last year’s #VA scandal.
While our #veterans suffer, #VA bureaucrats are keeping their jobs and their bonuses.
Many #veterans have already died while waiting for care, but the #VA can’t tell you exactly how many.
Meanwhile, deceased patients were still being taken care of for years by the #VA. http://j.mp/1LtJEJr  #veterans
The #VA can’t account for how the cost of a single construction project ballooned by $1.1 billion.
The #VA has been spending $6 billion a year illegally and has no intention of changing its practices.
The president has left the #VA without a permanent inspector general for more than 18 months. http://j.mp/1LtJEJr  #veterans
This isn’t just about problems that persist – it’s about a culture that won’t commit to solving the problems at all.
@SpeakerBoehner as I watch a decorated vet who is going to be homeless with pregnant wife N 3 kids all U do is tweet Good job?
@SpeakerBoehner will someone start a solutions center so we can fix Obamas Fup's. Oh wait it's #GOP #TrumpForPresident
@SpeakerBoehner I'm a vet using VA Reg CTR in Montgomery Alabama. I have seen and I'm witness to improvements. There is long road to travel.
@SpeakerBoehner Mr. Speaker you have my complete support + prayers. I wouldn't want anyone else. One day I hope to see you + shake you hand.
@SpeakerBoehner How do you explain giving away millions of jobs with TPP for big biz profits cheap foreign labor and a huge ck for you
@Benito35ddDavis @SpeakerBoehner He made 5.3 Million to give our jobs away! #tpa That explains it! #treason
@libertylady44 That's why Boner worked so hard for Obama. All about money. Does anyone in Washington work for the working people of America
@Benito35ddDavis very few. Massive immigration disenfranchises citizens and allows ruling class to stay in power. #enslavement
@SpeakerBoehner figures does not want it fixed
@SpeakerBoehner there must be a method to terminate VA employees without so much red tape. government employees should never be unionized!!
@SpeakerBoehner the same way you pass the buck...
@SpeakerBoehner Question: Why do we borrow money to run government and then give away money in foreign aide. Duh!
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorBurr How do you explain voting over and over again against our veterans?
“@SpeakerBoehner: How does the #VA Secretary explain this? http://j.mp/1LtJEJr  #veterans” what abt #IranDeal

Just SHUT UP!
@SpeakerBoehner I THINK TIS is wrong but since you haven't done anything hoe about
 PP DO SOMETHING
@SpeakerBoehner Quit acting like you care.. You gave up power of the purse. OHIOANS are idiots for re electing you.
@SpeakerBoehner and where have you been? passing out tobacco checks ?
@SpeakerBoehner maybe everyone in charge at the VA should be veterans themselves.  Vet's taking care of Vet's.
@SpeakerBoehner He doesn't, they just keep spending money without really helping vets. One #madvet
@SpeakerBoehner @txgbnr Reuters http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/27/us-usa-veterans-congress-idUSBREA1Q26O20140227 … says Repubs add The issue of Iran sanctions..has nothing to do with the needs of vets
@SpeakerBoehner How do you explain giving away millions of jobs with TPP for big biz profits and cheap foreign labor and a huge check 4U
@SpeakerBoehner With more #VA revelations, I trust you'll lead efforts to solve this problem instead of childishly pointing at #Obama
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorBurr I suppose you and Boehner will do something about this just like you have with Obama Care, Immigration etc. etc
@SpeakerBoehner I want to know why it takes so long for the appeals process?
@SpeakerBoehner How about you explain why you and McConnell won't allow a vote to defund planned butcherhood instead?
@SpeakerBoehner Just do something just one think
@SpeakerBoehner Oh I see you agree with @realDonaldTrump
@SpeakerBoehner Just play a round of golf & have a wine. We're knocking our heads together with you & McConnell inaction on anything!
@SpeakerBoehner It is time for younger, wiser, and more courageous Republican leadership. Stop giving O victories, it's not good for USA
@SpeakerBoehner How do you explain not defunding Planned Parenthood?  For God's sake lead.
@SpeakerBoehner How does Congress and Senate explain it? You have ignored VETS and cut our pay and then act like oh well. Trade places
@SpeakerBoehner and people want gov healthcare supporters can use the VA
@SpeakerBoehner you are a Traitor to USA citizens. Get a backbone and do what you were nominated for.
@SpeakerBoehner hire all veterans to work @ VA hospitals.. 80% of VA employees are civilians.. Veterans earned their jobs there..Right?
@SpeakerBoehner then quit talking about it and DO SOMETHING!
@SpeakerBoehner John Boehner u are full of crap just like rest of your progressive comrades-changing  topic's does not stop the conversation
@SpeakerBoehner - The VA secretary can't explain it because he really doesn't know and really doesn't care. It's all about checking the box.
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorBurr You 2 r good ones 2 chastise abt "more of the same instead of commitment 2 real change". #Hypocrisy #TimeToGo
@SpeakerBoehner all I know is I am waiting over six months to process a claim to be paid for dependents; one form, one page.
.@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorBurr Perhaps VA Secy will explain this by noting Congress won't appropriate enough $$$ and tries to thwart @POTUS
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorBurr wish you folks would do ur job instead of taking another vacation in August. Sad state of Congress. #burrshames
@SpeakerBoehner how do you explain that you only talk about it but have no action?
@SpeakerBoehner we know your tweets are political &attempting to down play VA Sec improvements for pres campaign prove with data& not spins
@SpeakerBoehner Well do something! That's your job
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorBurr Only proves that the problem is endemic and will require a top to bottom change in mindset and mgt style!
@SpeakerBoehner Well John use the POWER of Congress. The other two branches are making all the legislation, take back the POWER of CONGRESS.
@SpeakerBoehner protect the public service Union and screw the Vets!  Nothing changes Congress impotent
@SpeakerBoehner same way POTUS does==stall,spin,say nothing, change subject. NOT open and transparent.
@SpeakerBoehner You have more to explain that the VA Secretary ever does.
@SpeakerBoehner What are you actually going to do about it besides complain on Twitter? You vote in their budget- like obamacare, defense...
@SpeakerBoehner How do you explain being a Democrat supporter?
@SpeakerBoehner so fix it. Aren't you the guy we hired to handle this stiff. And approve the Iran deal while you're at it. Earn hour keep.
@SpeakerBoehner your "CHOICE" program delays care. Politics and healthcare for veterans KILLS.
@SpeakerBoehner have you even SEEN the diagram of the process?!!! If a vet says no to your CHOICE program - they go on EWL forever!!
@SpeakerBoehner He doesent have to!  You hold no one accountable!
@SpeakerBoehner TriWest has increased the wait time for care by TRIPLE!!! Back and forth with them is ridiculous!!!!!
@SpeakerBoehner 

Reducing budgets while increasing both, workload and expectation.

You seem not to remember doing that to them.
@SpeakerBoehner why arnt you on the va oversite commitee? Why is it considered a punishment?
@SpeakerBoehner #Veterans deserve better than a businessman who knows nothing about #healthcare
@SpeakerBoehner You are the Obama supporting, lying, do nothing, illegal funding, Spineless, cash for votes, Speaker of the House
@SpeakerBoehner from all the hearings, #IG investigations, independent investigations for ALL Gov't scandals #Not1 person accountable
@SpeakerBoehner it would be more beneficial to the veterans if we come together and solve the problems instead of complaining about them.
@SpeakerBoehner How do you explain the republicans not doing anything about it.
@SpeakerBoehner  Have you ever known such a scandal laden administration? A new scandal every day, it seems.
@SpeakerBoehner  How do you explain BHO doing what he wants and you do nothing to stop him
@SpeakerBoehner how can you explain the many years you have watched it happen
@SpeakerBoehner no, the question is: When are YOU going to DO something about it.
@SpeakerBoehner You spent more time working on TPA than the VA. But all you care about is big biz and big money donors
@SpeakerBoehner why don't you help -not just criticize? More vets came home, more getting old! @DeptVetAffairs
@SpeakerBoehner I suspect the problem is that congressmen get too many $ from VA execs, employees & their labor unions to make changes.
@SpeakerBoehner amazes me that this country treats prisoners better than it treats its veterans. Ive Never seen a starving prisoner in USA
@SpeakerBoehner I can't explain how you are still the Speaker of the House...#Feckless
@SpeakerBoehner Simple, you guys let this shit happen. BIG GOVERNMENT simply isn't effective at managing anything! You are all worthless!
@SpeakerBoehner If you were for Vets, you would make legislation to fire many in the VA! How about switching Congress to the VA system?
@SpeakerBoehner congress funds VA and has oversight over spending!  Balls in your court! #GOPClownCar #Boehner #congressmurdersdemocracy
@SpeakerBoehner how do you explain all the work you haven't done for the American people???
@SpeakerBoehner You really don't have any answers or solutions for anything, do you? Serve yourself another drink and step aside.

#ProfoundlyDisappointed
