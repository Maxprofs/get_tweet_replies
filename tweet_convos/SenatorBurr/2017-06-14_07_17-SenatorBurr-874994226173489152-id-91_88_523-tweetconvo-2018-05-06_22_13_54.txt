Senator Burr you need to be a leader & get behind our president we voted for. America got together and voted for him. Now you represent us
We want you to lead unite the party behind our president if you don't we will not vote for you. Trust me I won't forget.
praying for the mental health of all senators and congress folk. ADHERE TO THE US CONSTITUTION - Do your Job
No vacations our country is in trouble you need to work to get behind our president so the people will unite too. We got together
Hey maybe you will think about this the next time you take a big check from the NRA or vote to take health care away from 23 million people.
Thank you Senator Burr; God Bless you and all of our leaders...
Horrible.  Thank goodness they were there.  Prayers for all involved.
Pray BUT BAN assault weapons now
And to think it wasn't long ago when you thought the bullseye of Hillary was funny and joked about it!
You politicians wonder why there is a resistance?  That kind of behavior is why!
You and Trump set the tone for the rest of the country.
You repulse me.  I can't believe anyone would vote for you!
And we got Trump elected don't under estimate us. We will not vote for you. Do your job and represent those who put you there or resign
Happy to hear #GOP Brats had a little chat with one another. Repubs are coercive avoidance bunch whom relish divisions. #ImpeachTrump
Isn't it time for some common sense gun control? 154 mass shootings so far in 2017. Protect us, it's your job.
Prayers are with all of them.
How about sensible gun laws? I guess meaningless empty words are easier.
No one needs your prayers. We need better gun control laws!
Prayer isn't going to stop this kind of thing. Use your power to DO something.
Are you still 'joking' about Hillary's picture needing a target? See where hateful rhetoric gets you . . . Do better. Perhaps apologize.
-Stop praying and do something about it! Sensible gun control laws!
AGREE
Do you endorse the NRA's call for violence against liberals?
Vote NO on the AHCA so that all Americans will be able to afford good healthcare.
Where is the republican OUTRAGE over Mueller ? Why are you not standing up for our President?  If Trump goes.... you go!
Keep silencer restrictions. #GunViolence is an epidemic in America. Stop praying - Start making changes - see which one makes a difference.
Praying is literally the least you can do. Start legislating. Gun control NOW.
The hateful comments tweeted out of Washington promote this behavior. People are frustrated with politics and politicians.
Ditto
They were lucky; not so much for Sandy Hook children.  BAN ASSAULT & MILITARY WEAPONS NOW
Sensible, sane gun legislation. Is that too much to ask? Why does the NRA have more clout than the 15,000 dead Americans killed by guns 2016
Get rid of Mueller. We all know the Russia thing is fake & it's only going to fuel more hate. You will be responsible for continuing this.
We must return to civility and respect for all of our citizens, not only those who agree with us. Our leadership must model the behavior.
I guess that "bullseye" remark about Hillary Clinton isn't so funny now, huh?
Blood on your hands today from pushing a false Russian narrative. Pray you will be held accountable.
Dear Sir, yesterday we heard the committee isn't past the Fake Times story. We heard Dem members of committee say no crimes Today is the end
So can we do something about guns now?
Don't EVER post a pic of a bullseye on HILLARY's face again, if u did so before the election this year.  EVER!  IMO

@SenatorBurr I'm thankful they've healthcare to heal them today & cover any future sequelae that may develop from injuries sustained today!
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio  PLEASE STAND UP FOR our President! ALL GOP must stick together; all targets
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio  I don't want any of you in DC hurt.  I don't want OUR President shot.
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio  I know enough of you have enough sense to know there is NO RUSSIA, right?
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio  So what are ALL OF YOU going to do about this? The insanity must stop!
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio Shooter belonged to "Terminate Republicans" grp
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio  Shooter hated Trump and GOP
@TGowdySC @DevinNunes @ConawayTX11 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio  ENOUGH with this FAKE RUSSIA Story!
#BannedWeaponizedMindCotrolByUN #ForeignCountriesOutsideInterests ...
#BannedMindControlByUNFalseFlag warning shot?

Perfect time, #SenateIntelligenceCommitteeHearing #FalseFlags & #GunControlMontra

How many shootings have to occur before we realize "Thoughts and Prayers" don't do anything?
I agree !!! this is nonsense.
Time to shut down the Fake Russia Investigation. You are bringing violence that occurs in this country.
Wasn't this what you said last year?????
Nuts! Another #FalseFlag. When is this stuff going to stop!? #TrumpIsntCausingThis #SenateIntelligenceCommittee #KamalaHarris
Remembering your sentence that included "Hillary" and "target" and very sad that American politics is this inflamed and dysfunctional.
Hill cops are the best!
Start controlling the vitriol being spewed daily by MSM and leftists. This is caused by them
Would Burr have responded the same way if it were a women shot? Misogynist!
Simple solution GUN CONTROL and stop the NRA!!!!!!
Probably lost his health insurance sad sad day
I also commend the brave law enforcement officers who risked it all to save others and pray for the quick recovery of victims.
But faith without works is dead. Pop of NC 10 million. NRA Burr donations $805,000. That's 8 cents/NC life. Is that your price?
Or are we worth more? We need common sense gun reform. Now that one of your own is a target I hope your eyes will be opened.
Don't know why this happened but suspect it's systemic of all the political hate coming out of DC. PPL are traumatized & stressed by it all.
Did you pray for Gabby Giffords, too? Did you pass reasonable legislation as a result? Nope. More hollow sentiments & prayers from the GOP.
Gun laws, PLEASE!
Gun Control???
DO YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO CUT OUT YOUR INVESTIGATION AND STOP THE BS DEMOCRAPS LYING AND INCITING LIKE @MarkWarner
Thank you. You're one of the few that is even mentioning those officers. They deserve better.
Just a shame you have such ass-hat gun laws. The rifle probably came free with a loaf of bread.
If u did BC on everyone they wouldn't have to endanger their own lives to save people who pocketed $8M.

How do you think Hitler got to murder 6 million Jews. He spewed HATE!  Dems are now using the SAME tactic against the President and REPUBS!
Praying for all of you! #Unity #Love
Funny how you have prayers for this, but not the thousands who die from gun violence every year.
YOU bare some responsibility for giving hatred Dems spew @President & cabinet a forum. Repub twnhalls to congress, no platform for DEM Hate!
This is all the GOP & Trumps GREED filled, vacuous, unethical, immoral fault. Your illegal actions & taxation without representation is why.
How about you do something in addition to praying like passing better gun laws or closing loopholes. You know, like your job.
maybe you guys should listen to gabby Giffords views on gun control again! You can google it
NO one needs an automatic gun.
now time for gun control? Prob not. Shame
There is always time to discuss gun control. All lives matter! Better to save one today, than wait until tomorrow!
