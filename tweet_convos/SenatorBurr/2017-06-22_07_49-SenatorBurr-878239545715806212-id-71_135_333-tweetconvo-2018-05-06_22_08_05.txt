Too bad these kids have pre-existing conditions - if you pass Trump(Not)Care.
and @SenatorBurr wants to cut Medicaid severely so future children with disabilities will lack medical care & won't live to be adults
Oh and since you don't actually care about people with disabilities since you will be voting yes, you should take this down. #NoTrumpcare
Senator, these children are covered by Medicaid, still onboard for voting "yes" for these horrible bill?
Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy
Proverbs 31:9
Sen Burr, do the right thing: vote no on Sen. health plan.
Not the way @realDonaldTrump  treats people with challenges...
.@SenatorBurr, you can't retweet this if you'll vote to kill their healthcare.
Really!!! Out of touch perhaps?..."Bigly" out of touch.
Interesting retweet since you support a bill that will remove their healthcare.
Thank you @TODAYshow for promoting this amazing company and when given the opportunity people with disabilities do extraordinary things!
People need to know that with the right support and a little help, anything can happen!
I genuinely believe this!
People with disabilities are able to participate fully in society with a reasonable amount of help...a major source of that help is MEDICAID
Yea. Tell them your going to get rid of healthcare that often helps fund support for these amazing people!
This is just beautiful. God bless you guys.
Hey twit @SenatorBurr is going to rip healthcare away from these children. May god damn burr and the GOP straight to hell!

Voting yes to BCRA will hurt this very population.  You can't have it both way Senator Burr.  You either care or you don't.  #VoteNoBCRA
That's heartwarming! Now you plan to make sure they never get insurance, due to preexisting conditions?
How many of the workers at the coffee shop rely on medicaid for their insurance and disability related services such as OT/PT and Speech?
Your @GOP #TrumpCare treats people w/ disabilities . #Medicaid recipients, ready for #DeathByAThousandTaxCuts ? #SHAME #SaveOurMedicaid
and you're taking their healthcare away
These kids need America's support with Medicaid!  NO TO #HealthcareBill
Shame on you!
dont abuse those kids burr dont take money away from disable people voter no on AHCA a vote yes you might as well be sent to jail for abuse
We saw the Senate's horrific treatment of the disabled!
 A woman was ripped from her wheelchair!! 
#StopTrumpcare
Not ripped, lifted with care. I'm a disabled woman who hates these proposed cuts as much as *anyone* - & mis-statements like this only hurt.
And yet, @SenatorBurr , THIS:
A staffer with Senator Burr just told the protesters here that there is no bill for them to protest 
If you really care about this you will actually pass legislation to support people like this! #VoteNoAHCA
$300 tax credit = corporate buyout! #WhiteCollarCrime. A 5% off coupon ain't enough $ for 70,000 plan (#TrumpCare). #DeathByAThousandTaxCuts
Presumably everyone in this video relies on Medicaid for health care and therapeutic services. The bill up for debate would remove that.
Too bad the disabled will no longer have medical care because Medicaid will be gone if you help pass this bill. Just fix the ACA.
What a wonderful idea
Seriously?  If you care about these people then you will stand against the inhuman Bill!
If you see the value in this story, how can you support this healthcare bill?  Puts these folks at risk of institutionalize because of cuts
beautiful.
What will you do about healthcare for people with disabilities?
Pssst, most of these angels have Medicare.

Isn't this heart warming senator? These are capital police dragging protestors fighting for their lives because of your shitty health bill.
Do you mean before or after they are dragged from their wheelchairs out of McConnnells office for protesting your shitty health care bill?
I don't know how you can tweet this while advocating an immoral healthcare bill that will destroy Medicaid. Have you no shame whatsoever?
.@SenatorBurr this is great - you DO know that #Trumpcare will completely destroy benefits that most of the people in this video get, right?
Love this
@realDonaldTrump @potus needs to spend time here learning empathy
#trumPIGnorance is dangerous @potus LIES! #trumprussia #treason was a hateful vicious attack on US! @PutinRF plans
How ironic that any of these people who's care and education was helped by #Medicaid would not have fared so well. #trumpcare will harm+kill
Hey Senator. A lot of these people with disabilities are covered by Medicaid. You know, the program the GOP "Health Bill" would cut?
So what will happen to these people with disabilities on your horrid Trumpcare??? Most rely on Medicaid. My uncle with Down Syndrome did.
Trumpcare will gut Medicaid which these people depend on.  Please vote to keep the ACA.
LOVE
Beautiful!!! No other words!!!
This is so sweet! Would love to join and have some #coffee at #BittyAndBeau May even join your cute little dance parties!
This is the most beautiful place! #bittyandbeau #coffee
The people GOP believes have no right to live and take up space.
This is beautiful.
Different people need diffrent ways to learn.
Extremely moving video!
absolutely.  thanks so much for this.
God   bless  you   and   thank  you
