Bible says, "What good is it...if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds?" Don't just pray, take action! From NC citizen
why in the world would you vote in favor of allowing someone on the FBI watch list to obtain an assault rifle?????
thoughts and prayers aren't enough. You as a senator owe us safety, now buckle down and ensure our safety.
take your prayers to the bank if they are so meaningful and get out of bed with the NRA!  #DisgracefulDisloyalUnAmerican
let go of wanting NRA $
please VOTE to keep MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS out of the hands of all citizens, your "thoughts and prayers" mean NOTHING
there is no reason someone needs to possess such a deadly weapon
instead of your thoughts & prayers for Orlando, how about working with D-Senators & take real action? #filibuster #enough
your words are empty without action.
Take your "thoughts & prayers" and shove 'em. 

If you really care about victims, do something to stop creating more of them.
think and pray on common sense gun law please
You take $40k from NRA & work tirelessly against LGBT civil rights. Your actions have consequences. You are to blame for this.
@ChantaBSN @SenatorBurr is there a site that list all the politicians that are in the NRA pockets.
This is late but http://whoismyvoice.com/  will tell you if they took NRA money &  http://goo.gl/1CRqWS  will say how they voted
@Everytown thanks Jackie
if your heart really hurt you would stop taking $ from NRA and policing bathrooms. #hypocrite #liar
Prayers can't do much til you start voting to protect your constituents and require background checks in NC
#Enough is enough. No more hate, no more blood money from @NRA, vote for common sense gun laws, NOW.
you have blood money on your hands
I would be honored if you would listen to this perspective on the need for action.
Please vote to prevent another Orlando!
those victim's blood is on your hands along with @SenThomTillis and anybody else that voted in favor
You mean the LGBTQ victims? And what, other than thinking and praying, have you done?
Make a change. Your prayers are great and needed, but change in your place of power is more important.
If you really cared abt victims you would'nt have voted against treating anti-LBGT attacks hate crimes #meaninglesswords
You can also pray for politicians who have no balls to vote for a legislation that would prevent selling automatic weapons.
your thoughts and prayers could've meant something if you'd use your power to prevent stuff like this from happening
.@SenatorBurr Your #ThoughtsAndPrayers are meaningless. It’s time to start doing what's RIGHT, not what the @NRA pays you to do!
...and we are praying that you will finally take a stand in Congress to prevent this from happening again. What will it take?
You also voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act—against protecting these victims.
.@SenatorBurr r u praying that no one sees the blood on your hands or that no one finds the $40K from the NRA? #EndGunViolence
be the person you wanted to be when you started your political career. Find your conscience #policychangeforOrlando
Enough of your hypocritical "thoughts and prayers."  You have blood on your hands.
We assume that all those thousands of NRA bucks are also in your thankful thoughts and grateful prayers.
Prayers aren't fixing the problem. The shootings keep happening. Reagan & Ford wanted assault weapons banned. Why don't you?
.@SenatorBurr remember when you voted against legislation to keep people on the watch list from buying guns?
What's his position on gun legislation?
he voted against background checks after sandy hook. He has blood on his hands
Thank you!
What are you thanking him for?
Was thanking Laurie from Miami not Senator Burr.
I am a silly person. My apologies.
LOL! We straight!
.@SenatorBurr but your votes say otherwise 
Stop legislating hate against gays and give back NRA money and work to keep citizens safe.
do something about it.
The money you get from the NRA suggest you contribute to unchecked gun laws that allowed this to happen.
James 2:14-26
I am a constituent and I've had ENOUGH! #gunreform #gunviolence #Orlando #Sandyhook #
How much NRA money did it take for you to decide that murder is OK? That elementary school kids are expendable? ProLife my ass.
Who needs assault rifles? Answer that?  @NRA How about a prayer to get ride of assault rifles? Unless your prayer is hollow.
then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! We don't need platitudes or prayers. Stop taking blood money. Stop being a coward.
I'm sure they appreciate the prayers from the same man who accepted funds from the @NRA and made their deaths possible.
your vote allowed this to happen. #Orlando @MomsDemand
CVS now stock new AnuPlat®. So you can shove your thoughts & prayers up your...
Your inaction led to these deaths.  #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
stop praying and start doing something to #EndGunViolence #Orlando #loveislove you voted "nay" on background checks.
Ban assault weapons.  Thoughts and prayers aren't working any more.  Time to take steps to make a real difference
As someone who does bidding of @NRA, you're an accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Actions speak louder than prayers.
They don't want your thoughts and prayers, they want some action on gun laws. How much do you take from the NRA.
, why aren't your votes with them? You voted against gun-control reform in December 2015. Time to reconsider. #Orlando
No one wants your prayers! We want action! You want to do God's work? Here: #BradyLaw2Now!
Your sympathy means nothing if you won't ACT and #VoteForGunControl #InnocentLivesMatter #OrlandoNightclubShooting
I hope to see you lose your seat in the Senate and replaced by someone who will be voting for we the people.
Too bad you voted against Bill to put this kind of guy on the no buy list. You failed to protect us!
instead of praying do something. And stop taking money from NRA. Your hands are bathed in blood.
"Thoughts and prayers" are the standard response from politicians taking money from the gun lobby. Delete you account, RESIGN
trying to pray the gay away,  even in death?  Hypocrisy offers no comfort,  now or ever.  #Orlando #PulseShooting
.@SenatorBurr you're part of the problem
Your "thoughts & prayers" are useless.  Your actions & votes are what matter.  YOU, @GOP & @NRA brought us this massacre.
you are an embarrassment to NC. Stop representing the NRA and start representing us #stoptheviolence
Yet another legislator who built a career on breeding hate. Do not use the deaths of my people to attempt to keep some votes.
Your thoughts and prayers are meaningless, @SenatorBurr ; you voted to let terrorists buy guns
 #Orlando
.@SenatorBurr Your thoughts and prayers are meaningless. 
#DoYourJob instead of caving to the @NRA
And your vote will be staying with the @nra who purchased it #lawsnotprayers #DoYourJob
If you really want to make a difference, do something.  #Orlando
So please do not send your prayers and condolences when they're not heartfelt in the first place.
Between you and @PatMcCroryNC, you've caused more harm than good. Policing LGBTQ individuals and voting against gun control
Thanks for your thoughts and prayers, they mean nothing. These folks' blood is on your hands. #Orlando
You offend God with your hypocrisy. You offend America. You offend the victims and their families. You should offend yourself.
You're a straight liar. Else you'd do something about it. But you won't. Liar. Spend your NRA cash, Senator Liar.
then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! We don't need platitudes or prayers. Stop taking blood money. Stop being a coward.
you're still with the NRA. I hope we vote you out of office.
the GUN did not drive itself to Pulse! Nor was the gun driving to LA for the gay pride parade. We need a no Muslim Zone!
Stick your thoughts and prayers up your ass. Your vote allowed this terrorist to buy his AR-15.Hope you're proud.
You supported hate, and inequality for LGBT people, You didn't consider violence toward LGBT people a hate crime. Now you care?
instead of praying, you could push policy change on guns. Praying hasn't stop gun massacres.
Only 45 people like this tweet, Senator. Do you wonder why?
God's heard enough "thoughts & prayers" - it's time to ban assault rifles & hi-capacity clips! Stand up to the #NRA!
.@SenatorBurr $35k from the @NRA. If I wasn't so disgusted I would be impressed!
.@SenatorBurr Your prayers should be that Congress enacts sensible gun control & bans assault weapons #GunSense #VoteCongressBlue
ooh wait this is North Carolina! the land of restriction and vulnerability
your prayers are useless. Try some action for a change, you bigot #gunsense #gunviolence #PaidPoliticians #Useless #VoteThemOut
@SenatorBurr
keep your thoughts and prayers. You'll need them in November. Love, your constituen
.@SenatorBurr How DARE you take @NRA $ and vote against keeping assault weapons away from terrorists then tweet "thoughts & prayers". #sick
.@SenatorBurr as your constituent, I urge you to donate the $4950 you received from the NRA to @equalitync
You support anti-gay/anti-trans legislation; keep your false prayers. You can LITERALLY do something about it but you don't.
Almost $34,000 from the NRA. How much money would it take to buy your vote for common sense gun laws?
thoughts and prayers don't mean shit. Ban assault weapons--duh!
.@SenatorBurr your thoughts and prayers are with the money the @NRA gives you to vote against common sense #guncontrol
What more do you have to offer? http://whatever.scalzi.com/2016/06/12/thoughts-and-prayers/ …
is just another politician taking gun lobby money.  Blood on your hands
I guess with more than $32K of NRA money, thoughts and prayers are all we're going to get.
.@SenatorBurr No one cares about your thoughts and prayers. They aren't working. Try taking action like you should have done last December.
Thanks for looking out for the ones who want to massacre people with guns!  I can't wait to vote you out of office in November.
Sir, w/your record on gun control, I hope u are wearing a Kevlar helmet when your prayers hit the ceiling & ricochet back.
@SenatorBurr
Your words mean nothing- your actions show a greater concern for assault rifles than the civil rights of the LGBT community.
Thoughts and prayers don't keep assault riffles out of the hands of killers.
.@SenatorBurr America is SICK of thoughts and prayers! Take action to #stopgunviolence of get voted out. #NotOneMore #NoMoreExcuses #Enough
Maybe you could stop taking $$$ from NRA as a start. Do something about terrorist access to assault rifles and other guns.
The blood money you take from the NRA and your "A" voting record for them say more about you than your disingenuous bullshit
I think you're praying to the wrong $god$. My God tells me to do what I can to STOP this evil, not protect it.
Please explain your $32,792 in expenditures from @NRA. Thoughts & prayers are not enough.
Fuck you.
You know that you can both pray AND act so this doesn't happen again, right? You can start by refusing NRA money from now on.
Yet, you voted against the Hate Crimes Prevention Act to help protect the lgbt+ community???? Nice try.
Since you voted to allow him to pic has guns, what soap will you use to get the blood off your hands?
Your prayers don't mean crap when you have blood on your hands for being hostage to the NRA. http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-blocks-bill-stop-terrorists-buying-guns …
your job isnt to send out empty thoughts and prayers; if you actually did your job you wouldnt have to be doing this
so do something about it besides thinking & praying. Gun control can start with assault rifles. Or are you afraid of the @NRA?
Give the NRA its bribe money back and resign the Senate. Looking forward to #Ross2016
Why is your right to own an assault rifle greater than my right to live without fear, or simply to live?
Well after receiving over $32K from the #NRA why do you bother? YOUR THOUGHTS & PRAYERS are MOOT.
.@SenatorBurr $32,000 from the NRA makes you complicit in this and the other 997 mass shootings this year
Your thoughts and prayers are 100% worthless.
Orlando doesn't need your hypocritic prays it needs you senators to pass decent GUN CONTROL no assault weapons needed!!
Not helpful.  Ban assault weapons on any kind.  And I'm a gun owner.
You don't get to use this tragedy for political gain, you bigot!
Here are the GOP senators who voted AGAINST treating anti-LGBT attacks as hate crimes. (via @jeisrael) 
@HappyOldSoul @SenatorBurr @igorvolsky @jeisrael
will you be accepting NRA BLOOD MONEY for your next election? Or prior to next vote against #Gunsense ? Asking for a friend
We want action.  Expressions of sympathy from those in power means nothing without action. Please help us.
.@SenatorBurr 
Your vote could have stopped this. But who could resist that sweet, sweet $32,792 of NRA bribe money.  DO YOUR JOB, YOU CROOK.
.@SenatorBurr Your #thoughtsandprayers mean nothing. By taking NRA money & voting against gun control, you're complicit in #Orlando massacre
@HappyOldSoul @SenatorBurr
how can you say you have thoughts and prayers for the victims if you did what you should have there would be no victims.
fuck you Richard, you are responsible blood on your hands.
Screw your thoughts and prayers. An intelligent, moral vote to ban assault weapons would've prevented this. You are #complicit
your thoughts and prayers are worthless, mealy mouthed platitudes. Stop taking NRA bribes and help advocate for gun safety.
That's all well and good but are you actually going to DO something this time? #enoughalready

Prayers w/out Action is worthless. You have done NOTHING to curve gun violence. You don't get to pander. Vote out proNRA hacks!
Loved ones? PLEASE. You vote against love every fuckin time
this is YOUR FAULT. You take money from the NRA and do nothing to limit access to insane weapons. YOUR FAULT.
Instead of "thoughts and prayers", don't take 121k from the NRA this election cycle. #corrupt.
https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/recips.php?cmte=National+Rifle+Assn&cycle=2016 …
I hope God answers your prayers with a call to action for gun safety and LGBT respect #DoYourJob
seriously? http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Richard_Burr_Gun_Control.htm …
You've never done anything for LGBT civil rights or gun control so you can keep your thoughts & prayers, you hypocrite.
Yes, because thoughts and prayers will help undo the hate you and the other idiots have legalized with #hb2
We don't need prayers. We need senators with some courage to enact common sense legislation.
Your thoughts and prayers are also with the NRA's direct link to your banking account.  Hope you're proud of your record
NRA paid you more money than I make in a year teaching in public school. Maybe more money spent on education and less on guns
You probably mistakenly believe your a Christian.
If you think we're appeased by thoughts and prayers then you're missing the # 1 requirement to be on an intelligence committee
the only thoughts we want from you are ones on better gun control, okay?
Did you say a prayer when you got that $32k from the NRA. Your thoughts & prayers now don't mean crap...
YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM, time for you to take responsibility
Your thoughts and prayers! You offer nothing but platitudes. Coward. Do you job, pass effective gun control.
time to support proper gun control
hypocrite.
You're a coward Sen. Burr. If you were a man you'd use your office to stop the killing not offer platitudes to the dead.
