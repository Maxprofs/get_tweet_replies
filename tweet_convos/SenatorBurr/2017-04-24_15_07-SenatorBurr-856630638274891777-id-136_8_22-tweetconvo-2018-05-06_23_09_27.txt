See you'd think they'd want to deal with now and to try and clear names but the longer they waffle the more guilty they all look.
My gut is telling me you're not looking out for Americans but you're own pocket?  Can you confirm or deny?
Have you recieved any money from Russia or any Russian businessman? Who in our governement not involved with Russia? Can you answer this??

So are Women. Vote against #TrumpCare!
I agree. But, colluding with foreign agencies to elect your own is also in NC's economic interest?

If you care about ag. then don't let Plastic Bag return to Dare County. Nothing but trash- destroy the environment #ocean #agriculture
Yeah, it's a vital part of the Midwest too. Trump is choosing cheap energy (coal) & corporate farms over climate control & small farmers.
What would Reagan think of your treasonous inaction?

Call 202-224-3154 and ask @SenatorBurr to recuse himself from the #TrumpRussiaProbe
Recusing yourself is a vital part of America's national security.
You will see a lot of farmers go under if we don't get higher prices or government help. Take food stamps out of farm bill.

Call for an independent commission to investigate Russian Interference in the Election.
We know you're part of the cover up Burr. You will be dealt with just like Chaffetz and Nunes. This isn't going away.
You don't say?  Instead of wasting time with stating the obvious, why don't you tell us how you intend to expedite the Trump/Russia
investigation?

Sen. Burr lied about being capable of executing a bipartisan investigation. He should not only recuse himself, but also resign in shame. https://twitter.com/Isikoff/status/856495690809311232 …
Russia investigation???
Investigate Trump Russia!
Ok we know, but that means nothing when our democracy is threatened by Russia. So, Comrade, please do your job or step aside for patriots.
#russia #trumputin #russia #trumputin #russia #trumputin #russia #trumputin #russia #trumputin #russia #trumputin #russia #trumputin #russia

Fair elections are vital to democracy, Senator.

TELL @SenatorBurr TO DO HIS JOB AND STOP BLOCKING THE TRUMP/RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION NOW!!
WE WANT ANWERS AND NOT YOUR LIES WE C U
A vital part of our democracy is Congress serving as a check on the exec branch.  Investigate, or recuse yourself.
Men and women have died in defense of our democracy and YOU won't even pick up a pen. Shame on you. #TrumpRussia
DO YOUR JOB AND INVESTIGATE TRUMP AND RUSSIA NOW, WE WILL NOT BE FOOLED BY YOUR LIES AND AMERICANS WANT ANSWERS NOW!!
Please, just let Russia's interference matter.  Is that asking too much?
Treason is a vital part of Trump's campaign. DO YOUR JOB! Investigate #trumprussia or resign!
...And a democracy void of election tampering is vital to our country's health. #DoYourJob
So your Russian paycheck is enough to prevent you from doing your job. #Putinspuppet
And that's why we should support anti-climate change policies.
So is your doing your job on the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate. NC is watching.
Are you a traitor sir? This veteran wants to know. #RussiaGate
Do your job!  Investigate Russia. #complicit
What the heck?  Why are you blocking the Russia investigation?  First Nunes, then you?  Do you not believe in law and order?
SO is democracy.  Not RUSSIAN interference!  #wewontforgetyourDEEDS

Most Americans want an independent investigation. Just take politics out of it.  #TrumpRussia
How about proving election was legit and GOP isn't fully aware it was stolen by Russian influence.Make America look in charge again
Treason will affect Carolina's economy a helluva lot more
We need an independent investigation into Trump/Russia, NOW. #countryoverparty #doyourjob
you must RECUSE!
Checks and balances in government are so important. Please prove there is no corruption from this admin.  Stop apparent GOP cover-up,
Yeah that's exactly what we want to hear about. #TRUMPRUSSIA
Get to work INVESTIGATING your President & his many ties to RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA
Burrs to busy to investigate #RUSSIAGATE selling our ISP's our private info
DO YOUR JOB OR RESIGN. #TheResistance
openly interferes with investigations to protect a pathological liar. Dick shows Americans who @gop work for & #Putin is smiling. #inners
Congratulations on selling out your constituents and disgracing the title of public servants everywhere!
So is freedom. Look it up, as it is apparent you haven't a clue what it means.

just sign.
Do your job. Investigate #Trumprussia
@SenatorBurr is now defending the interest of Russia and Putin - #TrumpRussia
Senate Russia probe flounders amid partisan bickering: Burr won't sign letters requesting docs from Trump campaign https://www.yahoo.com/news/senate-russia-probe-flounders-amid-partisan-bickering-130323166.html …
And having a backbone and ethics is vital to our democracy.
Trust that the White House does not "owe" Russia is vital to the country.  If you wont investigate, you accept Russian interference, always.
U are not in the best interest of the USA if u block the ussr investigation. Look for me asa repub doing what I can to get u to loose. Yes.
Russia was a vital part of the DJT campaign.
But what about obstruction of justice? #Trumprussia
How about Russian interference?  How does that rank?
The Russian Investigation is a vital part of our nation's future. Get on it.
Hey Burr. Sign the fucking requests for all needed data, docs, Intel, WHATEVER THE FUCK IS NEEDED to get the Russian Investigation going.
Knowing if @potus is a #traitor is important to NC-Since you can't seem to #investigatetrump how about you appoint an #independentcommission
Burr was in tight election.he mut have got help from Russians to win his election.That certainly would explain his hesitance to investigate
And we need the hard labor of immigrants, whether or not they are documented. Otherwise NC farmers and the State's economy will suffer
No shit? Hey, let's talk about #Trumprussia and how and why you obstruct the investigation.
Do your job or pay the consequences!
Wonder if he'll help clean up hog farms in Eastern NC where resident's can't breathe because of odor and run-off pollutes rivers. U haven't!
Russia is a vital part of the Republican Party.

And autonomy from foreign influence is a vital part of our nation's democracy.
That's interesting! Quick question: what's up that Russia Trump investigation though? Why are you holding it up?
@SenatorBurr Because you lack what it takes to investigate one of your own. That is called being a traitor the character of a man is honesty
Stop thinking about money. They will make it. Worry about country and stop being a Jason Chaffetz  #trumpRussia #TheResistance #Ω
Devin Nunes 2.0
