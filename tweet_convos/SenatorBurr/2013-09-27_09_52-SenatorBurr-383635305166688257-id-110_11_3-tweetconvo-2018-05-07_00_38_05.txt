@SenatorBurr Most Americans oppose Obamacare.Plzsuprt House CRdelay ACA1 yr,rpeal medvice tax, fund military in case Obama shut gov down.
@SenatorBurr LAST WEEK AFTER MANY OF YOUR PARTY WERE CALLED EVERYTHING BUT CHILDREN OF GOD...I WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED WITH THEM ON ANYTHING!
@SenatorBurr Your "Twitter Dump" is too little too late. You lack the courage and principles NC Voters need in Washington. #MakeDCListen
@SenatorBurr Sen.Cruz is Patriot, U & mccain R Backstabbers,
we were totally lied to about Obamcare! Check the POLLS
VOTE TO DELAY/ DEFUND
@SenatorBurr so does this mean you will not take the subsidies for you and your staff?
@SenatorBurr very disappointed with your vote today!  You did not represent your constituents in NC.
@SenatorBurr Here's a better idea: Stop obsessing over killing #Obamacare and focus on fixing what needs fixing. Then move forward!
@SenatorBurr NO Obamacare!!! Shut it down and DON'T reopen it!!! Come home and lets work on our state.
@SenatorBurr Obamacare shuts down American Ecomony! Drastic laws require drastic measures! Shut down Government until Obamacare repealed!
@SenatorBurr Do you ever put yourself in the peoples shoes? If so, how can you hold the citizens livelihood hostage as a political strategy.
@SenatorBurr GREAT LIP SERVICE TONIGHT SENATOR. I WILL WORK WITH OTHERS TO UNSEAT YOU IN THE NEXT ELECTION. NOT FORGET VOTING WITH DEMS...
.@SenatorBurr A vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare. Please lead by example, not by fear. #DefundObamacare #HarryReidsShutdown #tcot

@SenatorBurr Border fence had mandatory spending and yet no fence. Explain that to the American people and use same tactic to DEFUND!
@SenatorBurr Eiither get in sync with the will of your people or look for another job when you are up for reelection. Very disappointed.
@SenatorBurr read your letter in Observer today yet you still voted along party lines to defund the ACA. are you that afraid of t-party?

@SenatorBurr what a load of bull. You bailed!
@SenatorBurr your merely a spineless Rino, nothing patriotic or honorable about you. you have shown your true colors to all N Carolinians
@SenatorBurr There would have been any need of any filibustering if you had an ounce of starch in your suit, you R wishy washy Sir.
@SenatorBurr You gave Harry Reid a simply majority. You lie to your constituents.
@SenatorBurr Are you one of those who voted to fund Obamacare and now claim that you didn't? Stand up for the people who don't want it!
@SenatorBurr blah blah blah you make me sick to my stomach!
@SenatorBurr This "statement" is as clear as mud.
@SenatorBurr The Real News team examines scary, little known aspects of #Obamacare. @BuckSexton http://bit.ly/1eNPoxc  

#DefundObamacare
@SenatorBurr Talk about hollow! U have no plan & just stopped the only one. Ur vote 4 cloture proves you're 4 Obamacare, not against. #Fraud
@SenatorBurr On Obama care! IF IT IS NOT GOOD FOR ALL IT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANY ONE
@SenatorBurr By voting 4 cloture today, u advanced Harry Reid's ablty to strip the defunding provision from the CR, thus funding #ObamaCare.
@SenatorBurr Lipservice won't cut it. We are not stupid. We will vote all RINO's out of office next time. We are disappointed in you.
@SenatorBurr I am disgusted with You .You need to take  lessons in having a backbone from Cruz . Why should you care Your exempt anyway !
@SenatorBurr You have no balls. You are Harry Reid's lap dog. Can't wait to vote you out. I hope you know how to flip burgers.#MakeDCListen
@SenatorBurr Have always supported you, but no more
@SenatorBurr 
TRAITOR BRUTUS TRAITOR
It's easy to fund Obamacare so it can "implode" one day when we're paying for 75% of your premiums. You've lost my support. @SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr GET A SPINE ! STAND UP TO THE MARXIST BEFORE WE R ALL DOWN THE DRAIN. I WAS THINKING OF MOVING 2 NC, NOT NOW.
@SenatorBurr come primary time let's hope the Republicans finally vote the best candidate instead if who they think can win in Nov. U R OUT
@SenatorBurr The case is already made.  We The People do not want Obamacare at the expense of destroying the future for our children.
@SenatorBurr With all due respect, Sir, Obamacare is governance on the fly and very irresponsible.  Any attempts to repair are appreciated.
@SenatorBurr We are not fooled. Your actions show you are are  a Dem  trying to deceive voters. Symbolic votes don't mean CRAP.  #TeaParty
@SenatorBurr you are a coward in the first degree! Retire & go to the lobbyist firm who is probably already paying you. U represent nothing
@SenatorBurr You did NOT #MakeDCListen You did NOT fight for NC or OUR #COUNTRY. #Vets #Military #NRA #RedNationRising
@SenatorBurr YOU VOTED YES ON CLOTURE WITH HARRY REID, AND THAT'S A VOTE TO FUND OBAMACARE.  EPIC FAIL, BURR.  RECALL AND REPLACE.
“@SenatorBurr: Read rest of my statement on today's vote here: http://1.usa.gov/1bMn8K1 ” don't need to read it, focused on cloture vote
@SenatorBurr The height of hypocrisy: "Patient Protection and Affordable Care" Act and all who do not do all to dismantle are participants.
@SenatorBurr If all Republicans in the Senate could present a united front, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could be undone.
@SenatorBurr we are not lib sheeples. We follow voting records. You failed your constituents!

Burr (D)

#RecallSenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr Dick, whatcha gonna do about Vetters Amendment to pull you back into ObamaCare?
@SenatorBurr The ONLY vote that mattered today was Cloture...you voted YES. Against your constituents, with @SenatorReid 
 
#EpicFail
@SenatorBurr Its easier for a squishy republican to put out a statement then to respond to the American people directly via twitter or phone
@SenatorBurr Your statement is full of lame excuses, Grow a backbone and be a true leader like @tedcruz and @SenMikeLee #MakeDCListen
@SenatorBurr Thank the GOP for #GOPCare Republicans that voted for Cloture are full of hot air vote them out 2014
@SenatorBurr

@SenatorBurr Your statement is false and you voted FOR cloture which HELPS Obamacare, why would you lie?  Voting you out.  #defundobamacare
@SenatorBurr I am glad for your vote today and I encourage you to end your fight against the #ACA. NoCarolinians need access to health care.
@SenatorBurr You will not have to worry anymore about being a senator because next election for you,you will be out!!
@SenatorBurr We're tired of your tired old arguments. You should have taken a stand and supported Ted Cruz. Thanks for more of nothing :(
@SenatorBurr you voted to continue the purposeful destruction of America #shameful
@SenatorBurr your done..go home....
@SenatorBurr You where NOT one of the Senators that voted against cloture so congratulations! You funded Obamacare #rinoalert #MakeDCListen

@SenatorBurr #dickweed   I'm ashamed to live in a state where we have an ass like you representing us.
@SenatorBurr @EricAmey2 What are you worried about Senator? Have you faithfully represented the people?
@SenatorBurr You don't listen very well, do you? Fear of GOP being blamed for shutdown=fear for your job. You place yourself over us.
@SenatorBurr So like other rinos you only voted against it when you knew nothing would come of it?
@SenatorBurr You failed to stand up and be counted... perhaps someday you can get that spine fixed.
@SenatorBurr You represent the ppl you are a failure
@SenatorBurr you and your statement are weak
@SenatorBurr Get ready for a shellacking!!
@SenatorBurr Progressive Sell Out!
@SenatorBurr how about help for disabled veterans from you state with jobs
“@SenatorBurr: Read rest of my statement on today's vote here: http://1.usa.gov/1bMn8K1 ” I am still disappointed!
@SenatorBurr You aren't a representative.....you are a tyrant
@SenatorBurr So you care more about what your "colleagues" think than what your constituents think? I can't wait for election season!
