Siguiente parada! Mexico 
Yo.... Translate That.
Next date: Mexico.
Ohhhkehhh
INDIA NEXT TOUR PLZ
I went to the Bangkok show only Coz she didn‚Äôt come to India  but I still remember the Indians and these ‚Äúwhite‚Äù ppl made some shit about her performance back in 2012 in India so maybe that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs not coming here
'Protectors of culture ' and hypocritical a******s in our country won't let female pop stars here.Damn shame
IKR.... I still remember the crowd was legit so bad and at that time I didn‚Äôt even stab katy I feel bad that it happened to her! This iconic pic came from that performance
And some Idiot filed a complaint saying that Katy was the reason students couldn't study for the exam .Like WTF? Did anyone force them to watch her.These crazy ppl are the reason why female pop stars avoid our place 
Oooo I didn‚Äôt know that!!! I just knew that when she took the stage with that costume people said ‚Äúshe showed too much skin‚Äù like wtf????
A bunch of rats is what they are
QUEEN ILY
LEGEND OF POP WE STAN
do justice to my poster that unfortunately does not exist anymore because when I went put it for you on stage it ripped :(

Media doesn't wait for verdict from court, it run trials on INNOCENTS & project them as guilty even if they later acquitted by court!
Same thing media has been doing with Innocent Bapuji!
