You got the one Katy! It's Ada Vox!

Can we just say no to the judges?!?! Because y’all are terrible for eliminating Thaddeus!!!
You sent home magic when you sent Thaddeus home! Can’t believe you pulled the rug out from under him after he sang your song so beautifully.  I would buy that record and I don’t even buy records!!
American Artist
I love you morta linda 
I don't envy you guys
F*** the singing you got to pick that dude who rescued his sister's child.
you are the owner! change it

do it mom
I agree Katy ... each performer has different attributes fans love ...
what sunglasses are you wearing rn
Haha...!!
Oh year!There you have been Magnificent!......
You all made some huge mistakes.. just saying... but l love you guys.
Ouch hardest part girl
the idols are completely amazing, and I know it's hard for you guys @katyperry @LukeBryanOnline @LionelRichie
Good nice
Many seasons ago, didn’t they have one female and one male winners? Or did they end up with one female an a male then only one person would win? Wish there could be 5 winners at least. We need more great  artists!
Lol, I believe it is a 'singular' due to naming the winner as a singular entity.
More heartbreak to come, unfortunately only One Will Be Crowned. #TalentWillSurvive
Thats why your paid the big bucks girl.
.. Really ..gudluck
I think the judges made a horrible mistake because Thaddeus doesn’t look like the usual contestant! He sang his ass off! He sang your song better than u! I think u type cast contestants! How do u pick Michelle Sussett who really is a bad karaoke singer at best! Bring Thaddeus bk!
que onda con trevor ahre
HAHAHA. Te extraño btw :( mañana hablamos si?
ayyy yo tambien, dalee mañana hablamos
I say YES! A male and a female @TrevorMcBane and @MaraJustine1 #americanidol
Trevor McBane showed up to my auditorium the last hour of school today. He was really nice to the kids!
Best singer

The decision is always never easy.

Especially reminds me of when you have so many talented people, but can only choose one in the pool.

I took a few courses in Human Resources and that was one of the processes involved.
Is this actually you or your team
vai dormir
Katy you didn't wait my idol
Layla is a star
YOU SAID YESTERDAY THAT YOU COULDN'T RE-NAME IT BECAUSE ONLY ONE PERSON COULD WIN
How are you Katy?
Yas
Preach girl.

There’s a lot of room for everyone in the music industry
They are all great!

How long does it take you to draft these tweets and then tweet them later?
I use the term pre-scheduling.

I guess it takes a bit of time to get it right. Especially the timing and wanting to get the details right too.
#BuyRiseOniTunes
