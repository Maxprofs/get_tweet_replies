Probably your worst decision you’ve ever made! Don’t know what you were thinking. You keep Garrett, Johnny, Marcio , Dennis, Ron ? Thaddeus’s voice blew all of them out of the water! WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR! 
#bringbackthaddeus
Yay Katy
Bad decision judges!! Makes me sick! Makes me not wanna watch anymore! He blew so many people you kept out of the water! The whole thing is gross.
hey Katy this guy wants be in your staff

Bad choice letting Thaddeus go!!!
where is #KP5?
I think it’s in the works, allergy she got a song out next month. May 17
Oh shut up Katy! I'm still mad y'all sent him home!
Give him a BS excuse like this isnt your time. His mistake was he should have gon to @NBCTheVoice
#BringBackThaddeus Or are you scared he'll sing other songs better than you? smh What other reason was there to cut such a talented guy? Name me ONE!
Can’t believe you sent Thaddeus home!! He literally sang your song better than you ya dingus!!!!!!!
Not sure what the thinking is behind it, but #ThaddeusJohnson was better than several that made it through.  Smh
@katyperry PLEASE BRING BACK THADDEUS!!!
The comp needs that big voice
V
कोण ही,,,
#thaddeusjohnson was MORE than “enough” he had Idol status written all over him. Travesty y’all sent him home
Don't understand that one at all
Sound like some socialist #snowflake bullshit
So sad he should still be there
I. Am. Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
Angry. With. You. Right. Now.   @LionelRichie @LukeBryanOnline #IStandWithThaddeus #americanidol
Bad decision
BRING HIM BACK HOW ON EARTH COULD U CUT THE BEST VOCALIST THERE.
you're such a great motivator! #AmericanIdol
You guys totally did wrong with #ThaddeusJohnson you've got to know
I love you and this show so much but like you should not have sent him home! Bout to burn tires over here
Katy, you robbed #ThaddeusJohnson of his spot... fucking show is rigged!
by the grace of God, sure 
I have one word for you guys: WILDCARD. It's the only way to take book this terrible decision!
Bring THADDEUS back! You all got that one wrong.
This was the worst cut I’ve ever seen on idol. Makes me want to stop watching.
How do you live with yourself after this decision? Obviously, it was your influence to let go of Thaddeus. The thing is Katy, he's a better singer than you are, and your decision sucked! You need to check yourself when you are judging.
Other than your PRODIGIOUS mistake with #ThaddeusJohnson, I think you guys are doing phenomenal!
#IStandWithThaddeus #americanidol
You guys made a humongous mistake with #ThaddeusJohnson! 
#IStandWithThaddeus #americanidol
Y’all didn’t choose wisely. He is a class act.
Big mistake — bring him back!!!
Really stupid decision!!  #americanidol. Bring him back. #bestvoice
"...put one foot in front of the other.. #BytheGraceofGod
This was a huge mistake. #ThaddeusJohnson absolutely belongs on #AmericanIdol
Look in the mirror!
finally!!! im so happy trevor holmes is out!! and also that b**ch gf of him!!! #americanidol #trevorholmes 
Booo!! WTF? Thaddeus should have stayed!
Bring him back!!! What were you thinking?!?!?
are u real
by the grace of god tease ily
That’s what you do when a contestant sings your song better than you. Cut him. #ThaddeusJohnson #americanidiot
Ouch!
So why cut the best singer on the show?
WHYDIDYOUBOOTHIMOFFTHEN?
#clapbackindeed
How could they let him go? 
Letting that first girl go thru is an absolute insult to Thaddeus. You judges should be ashamed.
This one decision tonight made me delete my series recording for AI. Shitty judging.
My whole family adores #ThaddeusJohnson So much more engaging + heartfelt + cute-to-look at than others. Cheering him on to wild + unexpected success!

This was a wrong choice. I noticed many people who got through afterwards that weren't as good.
Katy, seriously WTF were you thinking NOT letting THE most talented singer ( #ThaddeusJohnson) go thru. SHAME ON YOU!  Literally, THE DUMBEST decision by ANY judges in THE HISTORY of Idol...and I've seen EVERY Idol season. No more. #BoycottIdol
#bringthaddeusback
@bringthaddeusback


Your words are  on the bottom of people’s shoes!!! But you were right about one thing...HE WILL RISE...terrible decision!!! You guys should just fire your damn selves!!

Tell me why I'm literally watching American Idol just because Katy Perry is live tweeting? The focus is the contestants but all I'm thinking is she is .
where is #KP5
Man I almost feel like you're talking to me! Since high school I've always felt the exact opposite - Like I wasn't enough. I never believed in myself and I sure as hell didn't have any self-confidence (still don't). I hope one day you notice me! Would honestly make my life!
I was sad for him. And I really thought he would go thru.
Thank you for your existence!
You're special for me! Isso love you! 
Miga sua loka!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
