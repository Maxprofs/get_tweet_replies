Good, afterall some people pay for their own time somewhere before doing or ciommunicating out or either publishing any perspective article so whatever u want to do with your time on your understanding please do,All is your choice
I really want to hear you sing amazing grace
Proud of your dental hygiene 
U brush your teeth like 10 times a day so ofc no cavities
So you are purposely trying to join the negativity bandwagon?  It’s online 

잘자요 
Nice
It's cool that there are still people out there that read the paper! So many get their news online now.

Melbourne
Ur da best
The @WSJ will deliver same day...
Why did #Alexa randomly start playing last Friday night and reference this tweet when I asked her about it? @amazon
Wait, YOU READ?
You need more sources of news than NYT and WP
the post is WEAK...i delivered papers in the 60s...a buck a month per subscriber if you could collect...most of them would avoid you...usa what a joke..PAY UP YOU CRONIES
@katyperry  Happy to know you are seeing your dentist on a regular.  And having 0 cavities made our hygienist smile.  Here's to good overall health!  When in town and you want to catch up on the news stop by our office - Capitol Hill is always buzzing with the latest news.
I'm a subscriber. You can come to my house to read it.
We hear ya. There's nothing like reading an actual newspaper.

California is outside our delivery zone, but with a digital subscription you can at least access an e-replica and flip through the pages.

Try it out with this code, and feel free to share: http://wapo.st/roar 
Oh also, check your mail in 2-3 days.
Well done 
Katie, as a former newspaperman and longtime lover of the printed product, I'm so glad you prefer the printed version as well. But I subscribe to WaPo digital, and you're going to love it. So handy! Take it with you anywhere.
Pretty sure @NewYorker delivers to your zip code! 12 weeks for $12 promo here: https://subscribe.newyorker.com/subscribe/newyorker/112944?source=google_sem_dom_12f6TOTE_mobile_control&mbid=google_sem_dom_12f6TOTE_mobile_control&gclid=CjwKCAjw2dvWBRBvEiwADllhn6apctxsuJ1CtG5Li2xEfL85xOeBYZULfDLvZX5q3-wH5rb9uiHogBoCqJIQAvD_BwE …
Guys.
No love for the @latimes ?
Be yourself and you can be anything! I LOVE YOU MOM @katyperry
Hi Katy,
Would like to offer u a friends & family discount to some of the best CA journalism you'll find at the Pulitzer prize-winning @EastBayTimes: https://checkout.eastbaytimes.com/subscriptionpanel/?presentation=Basic4 …
and @mercnews: https://checkout.mercurynews.com/subscriptionpanel/?presentation=Basic4 …
Thx for supporting newspapers!
#supportlocaljournalism #newsmatters
Yes, @EastBayTimes is also great if you have a hankering for ads about hearing aids & reverse mortages along with about 15 pages of obituaries every Sunday. They also love listing "late" as the result for West Coast MLB games.
Notice this mom
Be yourself and you can be anything mom! ILY @katyperry 
Calm down jeeez
There ‘s this thing called “The Internet!” You can get the WAPO on it! I do, and I have done so for several years. Think of all the trees you’ll save!
With @NPR Ms. Perry all you have to do is listen. Great music, too, including you!
Wow! "others" have "problems" like getting shot using a cell phone. I'm so glad you have spoken out on the newspaper delivery crisis. @katyperry You're really something #GTFOH
#FakeNews anyways.
They probably dont deliver newspaper to blonde women!
Or sign up for @jameshohmann's email @PowerPost and get a nice roundup that also comes with a PODCAST (!!!!!!! )
Same!!! I wish they delivered to NJ!! 
Do people even read newspapers still?! 
Physical newspapers? Is that like a thing?
Meanwhile million of POC are unable to find food or water in America. But at least a millionaire gets her morning paper.
Hi Katy You are a cutie! Hope you don’t think it’s too forward. Love your tweets!
Well if you’ve seen THE POST, u know that the Times breaks the story and then the nPost runs the same thing a few weeks later and acts like they broke it.
Can I share my first essay I had published in the Washington Post with you?
buy
an

subscription
:)
I feel your pain? I can’t get @nytimes delivered to my new zip code. Heartbreaking and very sad!
AHHHHHH HEEMMMMMMM. I BELIEVE there is a certain little LOCAL PAPER You may have heard name of: @latimes . I will personally deliver the first copy of your subscription . #roar
Katy Perry needs an iPad.
I had the @WSJ tell me the same thing. You just have to have them send it using the @USPS
News junkie!! 
Go green Katy, read it online! Reduce your carbon 
I read WaPo online. Works fine for me, and less expensive than NYT.
Have your reps get and deliver to you.
Have it mailed to you
My God You are so well Spoken perfect in looks and Smarts <3
you know how to read...?
Good dental health for the ultimate win!
It's OK Katy, your drug dealer delivers so maybe he can quell your desperate thirst for attention during these hard times #priorities
Got to have that daily propaganda fix from the Commissars of fake news.
TFW someone thinks they are getting diversity of thought by reading both the Washington Post AND the New York Times.

"Oh we have both kinds -- country AND western!"
I can mail you my copy. Lmk
I thought that physical newspapers were bad for the environment.
Yeah for dental hygiene tweets #floss
Don’t think of us as a singular perspective, Ms. Perry. We’re hundreds of journalists in New York and New Delhi, Los Angeles and London, covering the country and world for curious readers like you.

This was precious.
Ok I need a dentist real fast
@washingtonpost online is fabulous.  You don’t need a hard copy.  I get @NYTimes too but end up reading WaPo first every morning.
LA Times? Not enough celebrities engage with the community they live in. It’s as important we engage in our local community as we do on the national level. @latimes
@Katyperry, I’m a fan, but how much have you been paid by Democrats to promote their message? Have you ever considered their intentions may be less than what you consider morally acceptable? If you haven’t, you should, they’re evil.

Get their app on a tablet & read it anywhere.  All the newspapers have this
You are amaxing
Wow! This thread is everything!
Wah wah
Same thing happened to my son - and he lives in DC!
I do digital subscription. 
WaPo online is a very decent app worth the cost of subscription, and no trees die for the dissemination of news...!  Thanks for all you do!
Not sure the lithium iodide batteries are that environmentally friendly.
mom your address is that for sure?
quando eu crescer quero reclamar igual você que em menos de um dia consegue o que quer te amo

You don't read, Katy. Stop.
Hey, Katy, we'd be happy to hook you up with home delivery of @USATODAY!
I love you katy
You're rich and famous. I'm sure you'll figure something out.
I’ll send you something through the air straight to your nostrils 
Sooooo, you can’t just send your assistant to get you one every day?! #delegate
I am sure a local youth would happily bring you your paper... though very few newsprint worthy of ones time.

The Female Orgasm.

Or…
BOO EFFING HOO

BUT NOT ONE WORD ABOUT SISTER KATHERINE ROSE HOLZMAN, NUN THAT DIED AT A HEARING
FIGHTING KATY PERRY'S PURCHASE OF CONVENT.
Or maybe WaPo could give you print but charge you 5 times as much, just like it costs 5 times as much to buy your music on vinyl.  
why don't you read the digital copy....
Wapo far superior newspaper (imo)
How is the world going to rectify this injustice  also, internet
How I imagine folks @washingtonpost right now
Just move to Washington! Problem solved! I'm sure you'd love it here.
Jonathan is a thot
Whatever it takes.
#privilege
Don’t you live in LA, soon to be in Los Feliz?? Subscribe to @latimes
Love u 
Katy @ WP
Hey, while you're subscribing, @SLOTribune covers news for the entire Central Coast of California, from Big Sur to Santa Barbara! https://account.sanluisobispo.com/static/subscribe …
@Gannett get on a shared route with @washingtonpost

WaPo should at least have recommended the Print Edition app that mimics reading the paper
Whatever
They don’t deliver to my zip code, either.  
The e-version on their app is pretty good.  
(Ditto the NYT.   )
Hi
@washingtonpost help her!!!
whats your secret?
you can get the @WSJ anywhere. And @latimes in California. Both excellent newspapers!
.@WSJ is available for $1 a week for the next 12 weeks: https://store.wsj.com/v2/shop/US/US/wsjusspring18?trackingCode=aaqrkql2&cid=WSJ_SCH_GOO_ACQ_NA&n2IKsaD9=n2IKsaD9&Pg9aWOPT=Pg9aWOPT&Cp5dKJWb=Cp5dKJWb&APCc9OU1=APCc9OU1&ef_id=Ws5SQwAAAGPdFzsD:20180418174617:s …
Consider the environment
I recommend @WSJ. They have a great wine column
Save a tree and get a digital subscription 
Queen of Dental hygiene
Why not get the online addition.... worth the cost

Get an iPad and save a tree! ;)
You could also subscribe to other news papers, LA Times, SF Chronicle, ect.
save paper girl 
Go digital!
The digital subscription is great. That’s what I use.
If you had the WP, NYT, LA Times and either Chicago newspaper delivered to your door everyday, you would still have a singular perspective, liberal fake news BS. Thanks for letting us know, explains a lot.
I'M NOT SHOULDER AND I DO NOT WANT A WOMAN AT MY FOOT. I HAVE A HIGHER MISSION HERE ON EARTH, MY MISSION IS NOT YOURS. AND NOT YOU WHO WILL DO THIS MISSION. It's just me, my love. ENGOLE AND ACCEPT THAT AT LEAST I GUARANTEE YOU. WANT MORE CLASSROOM? I WILL REPEAT I WILL REPEAT
Why do not you assume as soon as you die of love for John fia, and admits that you can not get another man and get stuck in him because only he likes you. And do me a favor, FORGIVE ME AND CARE FOR YOUR LIFE. YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR LIFE AND NOT MINE. I KNOW YOU LOVE ME BUT
Good luck with that. I had a recent run in with @washingtonpost ‘s “customer service” people and it was less than pleasant and less than satisfactory.
Thanks Katy Perry. It would be nice if they had newspapers nation in stores like the NYTimes does
Digital! Get a Kindle or read it on your iPad.
Hi Katy, the electronic WP works great!
the digital version is awesome plus you can save a tree by doing so
I've tried to get it delivered in San Diego as well.
#1stworldproblems
I read WaPo on iPad. Love it. Beautifully designed digital paper.
Got you beat: last week I went in and my hygienist said: Teeth look great, whatever you're doing brushing and flossing keep it up. #PeakDentalHygiene
oi hoje faz um mes saudade
Do you need fish wrap that badly?
I always suspected you lived on Mars.
And I cannot unread this Katy. I’ll never get those seconds back. Or the seconds it took me to respond. Ps. You are sadly disappointing on American idol. Highest paid but you seem to be making a joke out of it. Please watch jlo when she did it. Way better.
ah garota me poupe
Katy, do what I do, read it online. No muss, no fuss, You're there anyway.
San Francisco. Same. @washingtonpost is not even in my local library. Thanks. #newspapers
Or, subscribe to the @WSJ for coverage that isn’t #FakeNews
ur single perspective? please dont wonder why ur not seen as informed.
We have a great app for tablets though!
and mobile:
And Snapchat Discover!! 
@katyperry You’d also love what @thelilynews is doing. So many great digital wapo products to check out! 
In summary
@washingotnpost @nytimes
Answer her
stroll down to Starlight Books - I think they carry them there? It’s a nice walk in the neighborhood. 
It’s ok honey, here’s the plan if you want...I can personally go pick them up for you, clean your pool (if you have one), clean your house and take Nugget for walks. Sound good. Hit me up! 
A physical newspaper, how quaint.
Who confuses "#WP" for....
You suddenly can’t read online?

Ilysm
Love you mom
I get the digital of @washingtonpost and physical and digital for the @nytimes
You've heard of electronic subscriptions right?
Good luck with that. WP, while being a great newspaper with a great editor and writers, is seriously lacking in other areas.
Didn't know you knew how to read.
Get The New York Times from $15.99 $9.99 a month.

Choose between our Digital or Home Delivery options. You may cancel anytime.
caralho eu te amo tanto
I tried to get home delivery in California too but no luck
Same problem here. I subscribed to the digital version.
You should get Ratio’d for this

what a long tweet
have you tried
You are insanely rich. I'm sure you can have someone courier you a copy of @washingtonpost ... or yeah, read online like the little people. 
The hotel I stayed in this past weekend had newspapers in the lobby. I haven’t read comics since I was a kid. Here’s Ziggy in 2018! 
It would be funny except for the fact it is a scene we continue to overlook.
So, basically asking for favors because of your stature..great, got it.
Digital is in every area!
After I read a newspaper nobody who wants real news is reading, I’ll. Watch a Music TV show nobody else is watching.

Literally the same problem, which is why I shell out the $9.95 a month for online.  The @NYDailyNews looks interesting, but a bridge too far! ( The Guardian is free, but I kick in a few $ sometimes)
They should be able to deliver through Amazon. 
Save a tree and go digital.
First world problems. You do know both are online & you can even save some trees. 
Get an online subscription
I subscribed online for @washingtonpost 
More content that way too.
Do you live in the woods?
Your old soul still reading physical newspapers  jk ily
Singular you got that right; so open minded of you
I Love You!Come to Curitiba
Use my address katy
NYTimes and WaPost aren’t what I’d call competing perspectives.  “Open your mind Quaid”
Love that you read paper paper! Go all digital, and I highly recommend you read many sources of news. Including the outlets that are from “the other side”.  That’s the healthiest way to be informed.
The Post has never delivered out of the DC area. You can mail order though, but it gets there a week late. Try it online!
Queen of healthy teeth
Online.. save the trees :-)
i love a woke queen
