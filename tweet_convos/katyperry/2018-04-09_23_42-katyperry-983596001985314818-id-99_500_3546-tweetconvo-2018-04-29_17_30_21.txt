@MichelleSussett is my idol!! 

Only three of these have a real chance at winning. Why cut the ones that could actually win like Layla to let ones go thru that are not as good and will soon be voted out????
Layla is too young for the music industry
I disagree. Layla was a better singer and had a better chance at winning Idol had she not been cut than some of the others who went thru.
American Idol So Good We Are Loving It 
Layla shouldhave stayed 
we are going to shine like fireworks tonight they are all very good, successes, I already have my favorites from the beginning and they are shining every day more to have fun 
nice
So when do we get that Gaga collab? 
We love typos
Good
Pls change your profile picture mam

It was so good I got confused, thinking Dennis was part of the band. First time watching a clip from American Idol.

Nicely put Katy.. and I should add: you were a great judge
they all have amazing talent
they have such beautiful voices just loved ti
@Kaykaydyna deserves to be in the Top 14
She gives good hugs but doesn't sing better than some of the others... imho, but I am not a judge, yet....
Great performance.
