Who is the racist?
Springsteen is full of it. So are you.
I'm curious as to your take on Bono's thoughts regarding this:
Longfellow -> MLK ->Springstein. Time off, catch up on those George Will columns.
Justice is blind. And her will be done for the good of all Americans. SuperMax in Colorado is for super criminals like you. Treason and fixing presidential elections is a treasonous crime.
The Russian regime was behind the HRC email leaks and provided them to WkiLeaks. Apparently Trump and his senior members of his campaign team had full knowledge and supported the activities.

That’s deep!  Not as deep as the deep state but deep.
Can’t wait for the book 
It's the only thing Martin ever said that i disagreed with. I don't see that arc, and I've been watching for almost 70 years.
Doug Jones closed his victory speech with this analogy as well, and attributed to MLK
Thank you. When are you going to be free to speak about the damage he is doing? We need people like yourself to call him out in a highly visible forum.
You happen to be far from that arc. Justice will be served and you will go down as an enemy of the State.
Also, Lordy, are there tapes of that Springsteen show?
hahaahahaa
Corrupt, lying, DBAG
I guess it's going to start bending after humanity goes extinct
Hey #comey you should've remembered that before you fucked #Hillary and the  American public and destroyed democracy 11 days before the 2016 presidential election.
I’d forgive him if he plays a part in helping bring trump to justice
I agree and would join you.

I am so happily amused that you are quoting Bruce Springsteen, in a tweet I assume is live from his concert.
Freaking weird that all you tweet is quotes.  Don’t you have THOUGHTS of your own?
And then credits the wrong person. I think he’s cracking up.
You give us hope Mr. Comey. Thank you.
Never before has a President shown more disdain & disrespect to an intelligence agency that is coincidentally investigating him. He lashes out like a 5 year old throwing a temper tantrum because he's been getting away with that his whole life. #ImpeachTrumpNow
I will be laughing my butt off when its @HillaryClinton hillarin cuffs!
Lock her up!

Awesome I love y’all even more now that I know you’re a Bruce fan 
You've lost it, Jimmy
I am praying for justice.
I’m ready for moral universe start bending towards a better justice.
Quoting Bruce quoting MLK. Doesn’t get much better than that!
I'm not so sure that Mueller will be able to bring justice, but Schneiderman will. The fate of the GOP. In OUR hands.  When we vote every last one of them out of office.
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-15/fbi-edits-clinton-exoneration-go-far-beyond-what-was-previously-known-comey-mccabe-s … Justice will come soon!
I remember when the Democrats hated your guts and said the #FBI was a criminal org, now they love you almost as much as they do 
#CommunistDictators. Funny that.
Thank you Sir.
My all-time favorite quote
Get lots of entertainment in while you can. Prison will be pretty boring.
It sure does. And in this case the facts are clear why you are the one out of a job.

Where's the justice for the people who died in Hillary and Bill's wake?  Others?
Comey, you liberals got it wrong again! Justice does not bend at all! Justice demands the sacrifice of God's only Son for our sin in a public and sickening and abusive way for the sins of Christians! You wouldn't know anything about that!
That means it bends away from you.

Justice is about to bend itself up your a**.
You know, I've always suspected that those who spend their days quoting the words of other men do so because they themselves have nothing to say of worth on their own.
Just not for corrupt FBI directors like James Comey.
U to bad u didn’t heed those words!! OINB
WHAT did you do with those text message... did you call Hillary and ask to use her bleach bit.
Seriously: a high school senior composes these tweets.
In other words, the karma collection agency gonna get you.

Uh oh, James is drinking again. Don't do it, James. There's always a shot at redemption (I mean, after prison)

Who has hacked you?
Are you actually this clueless?
Do you seriously not realize how much trouble you're in right now?
You truly have gone off the edge. Wow. 

NICE
Run Comey, Run! You and @SallyQYates. 
Please run. Is it a Matter or an Investigation?
You seem to have mastered Twitter, good sir.
James @Comey destroyed the reputation and credibility of the @FBI, and judging by his tweets he's obviously mentally ill.

You know all about "bending justice"
Right? That arch didn’t bend in the Hillary case..
Life is too short to be little.

I don't know much about him, I just like the quote. Is that so wrong?...
Sorry, I still like the quote. Obviously, that doesn't mean I have to study and agree with everything he ever said or did. In fact, several of my favorite quotes are from Machiavelli, who begat the term "Machiavellian."
NEWSFLASH: Obama is no longer President of the United States.
GOOD QUOTE....LET'S HOPE YOUR RIGHT...MUELLER IS IN A FREAKIN MINEFIELD & DEALING WITH AN ENTIRE GOVT APPARATUS. SO IS THE CIA FRONT LINERS!
Mr. Comey: How was the Springsteen broadway show? We are going in a couple of weeks. Thank you for your service to our country.
You are fishing for support. You are such a political hack.

You know nothing about justice. Your investigation into the Clinton crime foundation and other Clinton  crimes was a joke. We know who you are...
So long some of us never see it for ourselves.
must be nice when you get free tickets? or rubbing elbows with liberal bruce? or with all the big shot libs? who just loved you,then hated you? i mean you riuned hillery!
I will have to remember that as a birthday wish to me.
The arc of your moral universe was bent by the will of the people that don’t believe you and your crew are ethical or lawful.

Coming from you it means nothing 
It's sickening that you play stupid when you know! Tell the truth!
The “Boss” is a Clinton fan. Not persuasive.
Springsteen has not been relevant in decades.  Piss off, boss.  LOL
Yep, you will go to prison
Springsteen was anti-military and is a punk
Millions of us will keep climbing up until it bends under our weight.
I don’t know why this doesn’t have more RTs...it’s awesome! Thanks!
 .. Thank you! 
11 days before the election, you interfered. That's how history will remember you, if we are still here.
But that was due to circumstances and information he had then. Yes he did a blunder, but that wasn't partisan... In hindsight that was an honest mistake... Anyone true to his duty would have done the same
He was damned if he did & damned if he didn't. Tough 2 b between a rock & a hard place. Not thrilled about the 11 days b4 the election but knowing what we know now, it wouldn't have mattered. Russia's interference was responsible 4 the stolen election. Only way he could have won.
@Comey ur worse then J Hoover u sold this country out u protect criminals like HRC&U thought where untouchable yet now ur fired&soon will be in jail u destroyed the @FBI by selling ur soul to the dems! Thank god their r still good ppl at FBI who will take U&real bad guys down!
He's running
He won't get far with the leg chains.

How long is the arc of impeachment?

Oh hell, if it were just THAT SIMPLE, I'd take a freaking bank loan!!!
My god ur stupid u let real criminals go who actually do the shit they blame Trump for! Yet he is fixing USA! Giving us jobs money &soon tax cuts! While dems love to keep u dumb & in chains as slaves! They are the evil u say Trump is! Proof of this comes out every day dems R evil
Trump is in up to his eyeballs with Russia. His son in law will go to prison, Along with Manafort and the others that were indicted.
thank you for that subtweet—we can only all hope 
And the bending of justice leads to corrupt "warriors"
Only when you become a truth
Teller..
Hey Comey, what you did at the FBI tarnish the FBI for years to come. You’re not a patriot to allow your speech and words to be changed in order to help Hillary Clinton. How do you go out in public?  You should be ashamed. these ridiculous tweets just shows what ID 10 T UR

Thankyou for standing up. Patriots are scarce these days and sorely needed.
Preparing for you broad-striped suit?
and justice is coming for you .
i’m sure it is and no matter how solid they think  they’ve got it (mueller and the team has it). even w putin kgb this is the United State of America 
"sad. glad. MAD. maga. SAD. MAD. VLAD....mad. SADMADGLAD."
-trump, just now
You are so full of yourself, I don’t know how you can even stand you!
Except when it's snapped in two by THE COMEY LETTER... unleashing all manner of hell. You broke it. And now your full honesty is needed to put America back together! WHO and WHAT made you do it? #ComeyLetter
Didn’t the FBI call MLK a “dangerous subversive,” illegally spy on him, and send him a letter telling him to kill himself? And now you have the gall to quote him? That’s “gross negligence,” Jim. @Cernovich @AnnCoulter @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson
I rely on your wisdom tweets. Hate is strong but love lasts. Please stay in the fight 

Can I party with you?
He's a singer, you had real power, his dumb ideas are not of the same consequence as yours.
Was that a moral decision when you waved the wand of ‘no charges’ or no obvious wrong-doing over Hillary’s butt?? Really?? You speak w/ fork tongue!!
Justice is certainly what's needed. You're goal is to play "get back" which is a game of revenge against Trump that you'll no doubt eventually loose. "Crooked Cop" is a term which has become synonymous with your name.
He wasn't talking about you, sweetie

"Be not afraid"--- when you stand for the TRUTH.   When you sell your soul with allegiance to Mammon-----you are----"A WORM AND NO MAN."
True. More and more info is coming to light that looks bad for FBI and Clinton/ DNC. FBI stonewalling congress and Judicial Watch for over a year on public doc. requests. As they come out ( slowly) looks bad. Some they simply are not releasing. There can only be one reason for it
No truer words could be spoken by a person that uses the law for subornation of the truth! Right Jimmy? U don’t determine INTENT! The grand jury does or a jury of HRC peers! But u forgot that didn’t u Jimmy?
Sounds about right tat u would get your history lesson from the old sage BS!! WTG CORRUPT JIMMY!
#NeverTrumpHillary Record Low Voter TurnOut Reflects #NotMeUs Want of Policies #ForTheMany Not What Passes For “Normal” Esteemed “Best and Brighest” Presidencies; (Obama DOJ Clinton) Comey Testimony Suggests Bill Clinton May Have Cost Hillary the Election
I sure hope so. Justice still hasn't been served re: #ServerGate though.
#WeinerGate
Thanks to @JudicialWatch, we know classified info from Hillary Clinton’s email server was on Anthony Weiner's laptop. There is an urgent need for a criminal investigation by the @RealDonaldTrump Justice  Department. 



I love this saying. Majestic
Despair is the ultimate sin. Abuse of power, the root of all evil.
Springsteen may be the most talented beekeeper in New Jersey.
Did you go see #SpringsteenOnBroadway and if so what did you think of the show? And you, Mr. Springsteen, and Martin Luther King are correct.
No matter what is found, it will still be seen as a tainted investigation...
Here's another Parker quote. *If you're going use them, please at least credit the appropriate party. (The others 'borrowed' it too.)
Jimbo - are you hinting at a Hillary Clinton indictment?
Does it bend towards justice? I don’t see it yet.
Have you ever gotten professional help . Psychiatric help.

another really bad week for the bureau. people losing trust.
No he only takes direction for his boss Hillary. U disgraced your department, and lost the confidence of American people. We think the FBI is corrupt. U should have stood up like McCullough
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OUT THERE ROCKING TO SPRINGSTEEN, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT HOME  SELECTING POINTED QUOTES TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY
You and Evan McNuthin can go away anytime now.
You give me the creeps, Comey. Go do something to redeem yourself. Ps. The Boss is too good for you.
Can't you come up with something on your own?  You have to quote other people all the time.
ez to say when you’re worth 300 million&still charge over $100 a ticket-I don’t know about BRUCE but I still live check2check&since I paid $80 to see #OscarPeterson 3rd row orchestra hall seats&I KNOW he ain’t no OP, I refuse2pay over$80 for any1 that isn’t at least on parr w/OP
@Comey As people have probably pointed out Martin Luther King, Jr, was quoting Parker. Gosh, you just don't like telling the truth at all, do you?
Me quoting Michael Scott quoting Wayne Gretzky.
I'm dreaming of a #MuellerChristmas 
Just like the ones I used to know
Where treetops glisten & FBI listens,To hear traitors on the phone

W/ every Indictment Mueller writes
May your days be merry & bright
& may all your Indictments be right

Yes can’t wait until you are fully exposed
Responses -bots or sock puppets or really twisted people.  Deeply concerned w/state of nation.  Like Deja Vu w/what happened in my business.   Headed toward where what happened 2me, &even you, happens 2 any American citizen anytime.  Can't buy that reality.  Must fight. But how
When you sell your soul, you become "A WORM AND NO MAN.  God Bless President Trump.

If I read the article correctly, Baker leaked info.  He also fed the Dossier to Mjones.  It's as if he believes agents can't do wrong. BS!
Quoting Barack Obama
Is this like a rule? Every Progressive fascist apparatchik has to be a Bruce Springsteen fan?
Inspiring words by a great man. However, the person rt’ing this MLK quote is the kind of person we need leading us. -US can only be great again with great people that engender great ideals leading this great county for the greater good
Too bad you can't discern crime & injustice from honesty & equal justice for ALL !
I hope so.
I'll be going May 30, 2018!
You are both hacks stealing thoughts not appropriate to your immoral agenda.
Does it bends toward justice when people like you are corrupt?
Always greed
Yessir
I have never been so afraid for my children’s future than I am now.  I pray- but I’m up against an utterly immoral administration.  Please god.  Not in their lifetime.  #MuellerTime
This is weird.
He is trying to justify an end towards a means.
Comey was in the Arc but Justice is a straight line.
("Me-2017")

Uh..this "moral universe" ?
You ever been there ?
& if there are cops there, do they do anything about politicians who delete e-mails?
If they fire Mueller you should be the first one on the street , you owe America that much.
Oh sweet Jesus! This man is a criminal. He better not poke his little head up. There's a sealed indictment that has his name allllll over it.
For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and brought to light.  (Luke 8:17)
Do you still have hope for this country?
Hope you understand this whole mighty mess is your fault tho @Comey
I'm believing with you
Freak show going to the freak show
Is this part of that arc you speak of @Comey
You should know. You're a pro at bending justice. #GrosslyNegligent
You really didn't think the Guardians were going to let you get away with a coup against our Republic....did you?
You can preach as much as you want. You gave Clinton a pass and you will both pay. And if somehow you don't, you will always have that label attached to you. Best to just give it up the show some class
It is getting very ugly, sir.  We knew it would. We will not back down.  America will not back down.
I hope it starts bending soon, before he does more harm than any following administration can repair.  I should say they as the majority of Republicans are complicit!
Enjoy jail time obscurity shot bag
You claim morality?
Actions speak louder than words and your actions are not measuring up
Lay off the acid .
Yep i am all about Justice for you and your crooked friends
Justice and truth will win!
I wouldnt take moral advice from you or Bruce, you're both morally inept fools
AL Senate-Elect Jones quoted that also during his victory speech. The Rev. King is and will remain a paragon of inspiration.
I'm thoroughly not impressed can't you come up with anything original. I want to hear the bend under your thinking cap. Oh by the way, Trump's coming for you. And then you're going to have to answer to Jesus just like the rest of us... Happy trails;
Perfect words to describe how you & your partners in crime can't run from justice for ever @Comey
Thank you Mr Comey.
Off your "meds" AGAIN?
DEPLORABLE TRUMP degrades OUR BRILLIANT FBI,IF ONLY TRUMP HAD 1/10000000 OF CHARACTER, HONESTY,BRAINS OF OUR FBI,I SUPPORT YOU FBI& I'M SORRY TREASONIST TRUMP IS UNAPPRECIATIVE OF YOU
I love this quote, there is no scientific basis to it at all, who knows what will happen, but it makes people feel hopeful in dark times like this.
wow... so what's up with your pals?? 
are those the same people you were referring to in your famous "The FBI is honest, the FBI is.. whatever. Between the new info that has been disclosed and you posing for pics like an asshole for some silly cryptic tweet??

You on Meds??
Reading this it's like someone telling us the arc of the story of what's happening now to its possible resolution & conclusion. Clues, people, clues!
