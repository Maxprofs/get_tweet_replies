Comey it’s ODD how concerned you are about the act of REVELATION but you’re not the least bit concerned about the CORRUPTION that’s been revealed 

Where are your LOYALTIES?
You mean because he’s corrupt?
Recent events - found in google - describe a less respectable Comey
Trump is attacking the very men & women who put their lives on the line to keep us safe. 
Trump supporters, please consider this: if Trump is innocent, then he should feel comfortable with the investigation. One would expect this kind of behavior only from someone who is guilty.
First and foremost, thank you for your service to our country, from a grateful nation.
Pls consider: there is more information that hasn't been included in the memo. We can't make a conclusion until all the facts are known.
In the meantime, Trump's words are endangering the lives of the very people he claims to support.
Good riddance.  Be ashamed of your fiends Comey , MacAbe and all the others in that memo.  If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen !
You may need to get ready to explain why you did what you did.

Another one  
I am glad someone from the FBI is standing up to a political witch hunt on all of you.
Comet you should be in chains
“Now they're planning the crime of the century
Well what will it be?
Read all about their schemes and adventuring
Yes, It's well worth the fee
So roll up and see
How they've raped the universe
How they've gone from bad to worse
Who are these men of lust, greed and glory?”
says the man who allows this.....
Comey, your such an embarrassment to this great country.
#OBAMAGATE  is official.  Mueller is now forced to disappoint all the liberals and end the biggest most Corrupt top fake investigation in American History. And turn it to the real collusion,  DOJ, FBI Loretta Lynch and Obama. Include the democratic party.
NOW that's  worthy CNN
He's leaving the FBI for a big money contract at Fake News CNN so he's giving fake reasons for leaving.

The only reason he's leaving the FBI:
I know FBI agents that think you’re a disgrace to the badge and the agency. That you and your little band of crooks maligned the FBI. So go ahead and take comfort in the few that liked you because there are a bunch of others that don’t. #dirtycop #FBImWithHer
I Don't like Comey.. I LOVE HIM 

I trust Comey. 
Because I trust Obama. 
And Obama trusted Comey.

Good men. 

#resist
Our Constitutional Republic is recovering strength
The mob mentality Democracy is crumbling

George Washington predicted Trump would "𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐰 𝐚 𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐮𝐩𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬" 
Comey why are you so weird dude


majority of people , see through Trump/ his minions finger pointing..I have never heard of anyone who complimented,law enforcement for bringing them to justice, unless it was an old Colombo show , they attack cause they hve no defense, want to taint juries ,afraid.
Ok people, this is a problem & anyone that thinks it’s normal to taunt & harass these brave men & woman are just as evil as the one doing it. If it weren’t for them, we would still have 747’s blowing up buildings but after 9/11 they fought tooth & nail 4 us
NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW MR. COMEY
Hahaha, Brian, wake up!
Thank you for your service Mr. Campbell and Mr. Comey. Now America needs your voices. What's happening puts ALL Americans in danger, even the deluded trump people. Fortunately the majority of Americans stand with you and the FBI.
...ssssssssstrrrrrrraight to @CNN? ...Weird.
Your legacy is him leaving, a tarnished organization.  Franklin said A society that would trade liberty for security deserves neither.
I don't think you even understand the quote.
No it's pretty clear.  If ur willing to give up some liberty for some security then you deserve neither
Tell me, do you think Donald is doing that?
No
So taking land from land owners for a wall is what?
Taking grazing land from ranchers is worse
So I think that's where your quote fits. Private land.
Thank you for this article.  Thank you for your service.  I respect the FBI and the role it plays to keep our citizens and country safe.  It is sad House and Senate has failed to protect this vital institution from attacks by Trump.
Comey under oath March 2017: 

"In regards to the President's tweets about him being wiretapped I have no information that supports those tweets as we have looked carefully inside the FBI"

This would be called perjury. 

Comey knew about the wiretapping, and denied it.
Trump is starting a war with the intelligence community. That won’t end well for trump. Those IC guys are really smart. It’s almost like they’re paid to be that way......
Was he an understudy of yours? Corruption 101 taught by the master.
Good catch!! Special Assistant to James Comey...
He’s being paid well to bash Trump at CNN
He's using code for "turn up the heat, Josh" 
Guilty people tend to get chatty Jimmy.
@ThomasWictor put this bug in my ear about Comey intentionally trolling for a reason and now I can't unsee it.
Exactly. He’s trying to build public support from the left. It’s his only play
Comey and Mueller BFF.  Can't get a read here.  Comey copped a deal, maybe? Because bff Mueller going to take down Hillary state Dept and Obama doj? Potus needs the public in love with Mueller so that they can't deny his findings, whatever they end up being.
Right, ignore the facts and follow blindly - the democratic motto.
Please, cast your  light upon us and learn us what these alleged facts are.
No I was talking to the other guy.
Dv652
Thank you for your service. Americans love and support the FBI for keeping us safe.
Today, we learned for a fact that the @Comey FBI & DOJ conspired, with a British SPY, to manipulate the FISA court, help Clinton win the election & spy on @realDonaldTrump campaign. 

Comey & the rest should be charged for Treason. Hang your head in shame!
#ObamaGate 
#MemoDay
Please do.
Oh look another criminal. Get a lawyer Jim, you know where this leads.
Your post just proves your ignorance..
I spent 18 years at DOJ. Here’s the truth about the men and women there.
And your twitter bio says “Born out of Hillary with a hat tip to Obama” and you really expect people to think you were non partisan in your job?
I left DOJ to enter political world. Before that, my thoughts were my own.
Uh huh...seems like a lot of folks like you that were “non-partison” at DOJ/FBI....are suddenly hyper partisan.
GOP leaders are absolutely terrified of the growing obstruction of justice case Robert Mueller is building against Donald Trump. They know that if you pull one thread, the entire administration -- and their extreme agenda -- could quickly come unraveled.
Proof of obstruction please.
Trump told Russians on camera he fired Comey to stop the investigation. There’s your proof.
That’s proof of what exactly. Comey told Trump he wasn’t under investigation. Not to mention all of the dems called for his firing 2 months prior.
Trump did NOT ask Comey to end the investigation- he asked Mueller if he could go easy on Flynn (who was set up).
You are seriously the weirdest, most creepy, most gross, most narcissistic, unaware person on Twitter. I can't believe you were allowed to be in charge of the FBI. No wonder it's screwed up.
Another great pick, Obama. Nice work. 
Comey was assistant director under George W Bush.
A denial of what exactly? That nothing of a memo?
You got me. The people against the idiot con man are definitely the Kool Aid drinkers.
Why did you sign three fisa warrants to spy on American citizens when you knew they were based on a fake dossier?
They weren’t based on the dossier! Educate yourself!
Understand this America: @realDonaldTrump @GOP @DevinNunes @freedomcaucus @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends cost us a good @FBI agent...so far!
Special Agent Josh Campbell has left the @FBI BECAUSE of these people!

IT IS A DISGRACE & THEY ALL SHOULD BE ASHAMED!
he was james comey's assistant. he just happened to leave that off of his bio. Whatever. he's another crazy ass leftist. Good riddance.
Yes Mr Comey you will certainly be missed. Especially when you're sitting in federal prison I will be sure and come and visit you and even put money on your commissary book
Missed your call me is not even a good liar. For one he stated he was going to reopen the Clinton case prior to the election, days before the election. He got one ass chewing for that by Hillary LOL why do you think she was let go she put a bounty on his head
Oh wow, you're a real crazy person. Who gave you the internet? You should quit.
Whatever you say James. You're going to prison. Don't worry it's not that bad I've been there at the federal prison camp before you'll enjoy it
Josh off to CNN to report fake news. Bet Comey is close behind. Both may be in jail soon.
JAMES, what a crock! CNN job, biased and your former rank and file FBI agents should be so ashamed of you and your behavior! Rule of law above politics, you reversed those!
Isn't this the truth:
It's interesting how the media are obsessed who screwed Trump, but they have no interest in finding out who screwed America. #StormyDaniels 
Thanks for sharing.  Both of you continue to do what you do best.  @comey we sure miss you at Hoover High 
tRump is the one to go to jail.... Along with his ALLIGATORS!!!!
Tell me, James. Was it Gritz that sent the top brass in the FBI to go full on seething against Gen Flynn? Did he just mess with the wrong people? Did u and McCabe have to show him who's boss? Everything will be revealed. Every. Single Thing. I think it all goes back to Robin.
His voice is being taken to @cnn where he is now a contributor.  Funny how that works.
National conversation or the FALSE NARRATIVE you are mind controlling the American people with?
Im waiting for the rats to start eating each other. You will be a popular subject in the Grand Jury hearings. You need so jail time. Take Josh Campbell with you. #LockThemUp #DrainTheSwamp
Ya who's going to wipe your boots or tell you how awesome you are..now that he's gone? Oh I Kno  -- Muller
I'm disappointed he didn't stay to work to clean up the culture of corruption in the highest levels of the organization.
how do you know hell be missed?? You are ceratinly not missed at the @fbi #comeywhole

Josh Campbell was your special assistant, oh he agrees with you, lack of transparency and accountability in the face of wrongdoing doesn't erode public faith in the institution, more lack of transparency and accountability is needed to restore that faith.
#Transparency
"Unfair"? I don't think so. No one is attacking the FBI, just the morons running it.
You mean his new post as contributing propagandist @CNN?
It is a very sad time when good people feel they can no longer protect the country and it's citizens because of political greed. Unfortunately tyrants like to replace these good honorable ppl with loyalists to 1 and one person only. We seem to be sluding down the rabbit hole.
You won’t be grinning in prison
Please SHOW PROOF of OBSTRUCTION!!! Stop spreading propaganda.
Thank you for your service Special Agent Josh S Campbell! Thank you for speaking out, as we need your voice for such a time as this! United we will prevail - real Americans support you all!!
Since he's a Democrat donor, we're not surprised he's joining CNN. Non-partisan, upstanding agents won't miss those who abused their positions of power. Sincerely hoping that Director Wray cleans up that problem. We can't have the wrongdoing continue. #RestoreIntegrity
'insurance policy'

plus your own self-appointed role as 'investigator of matters, judge, jury and exonerator' after Lynch compromised herself? 

You are not credible - either of you.
Lawyer up
Welme thankyou for your service and walking with us
What’s insane to me is that the president wouldn’t even be able to pass a simple police background check, yet presumably good, honest cops are quitting their jobs because of him. It’s preposterous!
It would be nice to hear of one of their accounts.
I think we will.
EVERY single one FBI feels like they have been VICTIMIZED Humiliated in front of the ENTIRE  so that B KKK white Republican Apartheid Regime can COVER their Asz. THIS MUCH CORRUPTION entire WORLD  and her Husband KNOW EVERY single EVIDENCE available then WTF KKK Republican??
1 FEARLESS Woman SHAME on you IF you are NOT PART of TREASON a crime punishable by DEATH in MANY countries till TODAY STAND UP if you are MEN . Done 
We are ready to stand against these horrible attacks. We can't let these monsters take their hate and kill the FBI, the very institution that protects US ALL!!!
Comey under oath March 2017

"In regards to the President's tweets about him being wiretapped I have no information that supports those tweets as we have looked carefully inside the FBI"

YOU KNEW ABOUT THE WIRE TAPPING! Can only hope Trump bans you from ever serving again.#MAGA

If the dossier was not “essential” and other evidence was substantial, how did Carter Page become so inconsequential in the investigation?
It was just another small piece in the Russia puzzle. So far the four others charged are also a part of the Russia puzzle.  It really all comes down to that!!!
The unclassified memo shows Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein misled the FISA court. Andrew McCabe testified that a FISA warrant would never have been issued to spy on Trump without Hillary’s phony Russia dossier. WITHOUT IT no Russian collusion story & no Mueller investigation.
Bahahahahahaha
Swallow that truth menny penny.
We all know what you swallow Roger.......
Assistant to Comey.
To make you smile Mr. Comey:
Nunes also breaking several crack commandments 

Never let them know your next move…
FYI arrogance is an ugly trait.
How could Bush-CIA pay millions in cash to Sunni then Shiites in Iraq to
Fight each other to discredit Islam by
Feeding on old bad habits?
Comey you destroyed the FBI by obstructing justice on Hillary and taking it out on Trump. You should have grown a pair and outed Obama and Lynch for their crimes
Msg 4 so-called “resisters:”. Essentially, ur hoping r country fails.  If u objectively examine Trump agenda & economic successes, what exactly r u resisting?
Sadly appears they are resisting creating a strong America in favor of doing favors for global gain and kickbacks of all kinds from those who will benefit if America is weakened and destroyed. The resisters only do what the media tells them to because they don't know any better.
Very sad that this agent felt he had to do that...People in all walks of life face challenges; They don’t walk away.
Look at the challenges the President has had to deal with.
What is happening in judge Contreras’ courtroom? Motions to dismiss etc. by Defendants John Podesta, Huma Abedin and Debbie wasserman Schultz?
2 #dirtycop s
Your going to PRISON for a long long time Mr Comey
Another swamp creature slithering out of the muck
Someone new to leak to, JimBob?
This will be your only defense
hmmmm

https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1888663267824923&id=1308229519201637 …
he was your assistant, this is more honest..
Another consequence of President @RealDonaldTrump ongoing efforts to shutdown the Russian investigation by maligning the FBI and the DOJ, the American people r watching these IDIOTS!
Looks like another swamp member gone. Mr. President keep up the good work!

No. He's going to do media cover up to save your butt. #corruption #deepstate
You started this #Trumpism 
America will remember you. 
Now he wants US to pay for his Big Military Parade. 
#StateofOurUnion is - incompetent men are ruining US.
Unfair.  Maybe you, Mueller, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Rosenstein and that other dude shouldn't have politicized it. Maybe once the swamp is drained the .@fbi can get the reputation back.
Calm down, back up & look at the facts!

Fact: 6 FBI agents have been reassigned due investigating @realDonaldTrump 

That's troubling!

@Comey , please keep tweeting it has revealed your true character!
What's the #SecretSociety Comey?
Says the dirty cop...
2/
cautious of sending information to the US. We have no power to stop this decline into autocracy. You, Americans, have. Trump is as dangerous as any dictator, alive or deceased. His government is high on power an will do anything to keep it. They have deep seeded frustrations
3/ 
that they're acting out. The limit to what they're capable of moves a little further each day. Time is running out. Trump feels invincible. Republicans and far-right groups feel redeemed. Mr. Campbell acted. My heart breaks for him. Act now. Honor the honorable. 
Wait wait wait!?!?! You want US to treat you blindly, trust you blindly, but you're as bias as the left would want you to be. You've created a den of liars and currpt practices. We will not blindly believe the @FBI anymore
Why didn't Campbell decide to resign when you leaked your govt memos to the news media? Why didn't he protest your "do as I say and not as I do" attitude that you threatened the rank and file over? Campbell is a whiner! See ya...
just wondering but @Comey, you do realize you are no longer with or associated with the FBI?  Find a hobby or another job.......PLEASE!
Of Course CNN
He won't be missed at the #FBI .
Our #Patriots within the Bureau are disgusted and are cleaning house. They'll bring the Bureau back to respectability and trustworthiness. 
With help from #WeThePeople they will make the FBI great again after you tarnished it's great name.
#MAGA
@joshscampbell is running scared because of his connection to you! Nobody walks away from a career with the FBI after working there for 10 years to become an activist! Lordy Comey what’s happened to you?
@Comey There is little worse than a dirty cop. You've betrayed your family, your peers and your country. This time, there will be consequences.

You forgot to mention that is person was formerly your assistant at the FBI.  So I am assuming he will be doing your bidding from here on out.  Too bad it wont keep you out of trouble.
Drain the swamp!!!!!
You , Mr Comey,  tarnished the FBI.... Now you're going to blame it on politics from the right,not a chance my friend...you are better off moving to a country that doesn't have extradition to the USA. #AndrewMcCabe
You won’t be missed.
I don’t recall anyone accusing rank and file agents of political colusion and abuse of powers. They are usually outside of politics. The management however should be prepared to withstand the pressures of bias for selfish (career building) reasons.
Actually, it is time the American Citizens speak out against the partisan FBI and DOJ criminals that attempted to interfere in the election of a president and the attempt to unseat a president after his election. FBI & DOJ are not targets, you & a few others are.  #DrainTheSwamp
How about Thomas Martens?
How much cut $$$ is  @JoshCampbell going to receive after you release your #Fake book? Nice try SCUMBAG AND @Cnn #FakeNews is #Rigged
don't worry James, I'm sure their aim will get better! Lmao!!
Did you actually know this individual or are you just trying to use your post as corruption and conflict of interest-shrouded ex-FBI Director as a position from which to exert political power?

Wow, you really are an #ObamaAppointee aren't you?
Read the article. So sad that decent people have to leave so that they can rail against the destruction of our Democracy by a wannabe banana republic dictator.
Wrong , We the public doesn't trust the corrupted individuals that are in the FBI
He left because of the corruption being found out.  Gor out while the getting was good.  Leaker

Wow Very powerful article , disheartened by the direction our Country is in under the leadership  of our new administration...

If Special Agent Josh Campbell is so concerned about maintaining our national security, and the integrity of the FBI, then he lost his capability to do so by defiantly resigning. With special agents being fired and resigning, it appears more like they are fleeing a sinking ship.

Radcliffe said "both sides should be heard" #ReleaseDEMmemo. He also said that he has only seen a small percent of the documents he needed to see. He's in a place where he will see them. Calstrum is completely out of the loop... retired. And its Fox News playing to their watchers
Thank you for service Mr Campbell!  I hope that the agents of FBI can stay strong and weather the storm.  You remind us how important the FBI is to our country
Does any other Terrain notice a pattern of "resignations" of almost any and all who were apart of this FISA warrant plot to throw a hail mary pass for hrc campaign ? This odd Comey creature thinks Terrains are idiots, interesting species the comey...
our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men – not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate, and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular
Again , my hero , E.R.M
#IStandWithFBI and @joshscampbell God's Blessings.
What about those in the FBI who think you are a disgrace? Will you give them a voice? Do their voices matter to you?
I would’ve hoped you would have said it was because your bosses are Biased as hell. Now we know you are biased as hell. Glad you’re quitting

Seriously, stop talking. Lawyer up.  Karma
Comey's special assistant is mad that Comey has been outed as a political hack.
Also, the NYT is not disclosing that the author is Comey's former special assistant.

Corruption gone wild! I hope karma is coming for you!  Go ahead and keep pretending you are decent.
Gee, this is what this country has become in just one year of lunacy!  I feel for the FBI personnel.  I once had an interest in joint the FBI 15 years ago but things got in the way.  So sad what is going on.  Losing good people because of one moronic lunatic!
Go ahead treat this like a game of words , this is against everything these people swore to protect. Nothing less than a coup attempt by the people involved. The Oath of Service means something betraying it and attempting this warrants extreme measures in gitmo.
Obama said Watergate ?
Watch my this hold my Beer ! and sh*t on this country to install a candidate that stole her own parties nomination by corruption and back channel deals. Alot of people need to be getting dragged out of their houses by tactical teams.
The promise of a fair election of privacy in any situation is out. The people we are supposed to believe in and trust to keep us safe crooked and compromised. The faith in the 
"System" gone and it is scary. The political games went too far and killed any trust and for what.
Things like this breed long standing hatreds. It's already hard enough to get anything done in this country and the fact that the Democrats even just a select few did this is being compounded by the fact the rest of the Party and MSM defend them which makes them a part of it.
Such a sad day in our Nation and fear ominous future lies ahead! How sad such a dedicated employee had to make this choice!
Jail COMEY 
LYING TO CONGRESS IS A CRIME
#ReleaseDEMmemo #ReplaceNunes @JanzforCongress
more lying weasels leaving is a welcomed 
Why do you still act like you are part of the FBI? don’t you understand what being fired means? SMH
Perhaps he should wait to see if Mueller actually finds that some in  FBI were tainted and did wrong.Then commit to rebuilding confidence in the FBI. By quitting  it appears he doesn’t want to caught doing something wrong.Shame on you for using him to further your agenda
His voice is like one cymbal pounding hot air. There are two sides to this story, but only one Truth.  Let the Truth be known.
When did certain people in the intelligence community and @FBI become so all powerful that they feel they can threaten their commander and chief @realDonaldTrump and step on the constitution believing that their end justifies any means?
You have the right to remain silent.  Tick tock

@joshcampbell Thank you, for having the courage and understanding to share important information with the Civilian population. You will come under scrutiny, harassment, and possibly even threats from those who feel either threatened or angered. A shame..
He had a job lined up with CNN.  That's why he left
They bully  you  hope you  fight back hard  this time

Good riddance.  He was a crook and a hack
NEW: " @SaysSimonson and I take a long look at former Comey assistant and new @CNN analyst @joshscampbell. A source with close ties to @FBI tells us "Comey had a direct hand in securing his new CNN position in return for an exclusive interview."
If U would have been Upfront & Honest from the start this would have never happened. U & the DNC along with a few others TARNISHED THE TRUST. 
In my heart & mind I respect those in uniform but every once in awhile U have to weed out the Bad APPLES SUCH AS YOU

Your vote of approval is all I need to know that he’s a partisan hack like you.
What conversation- The lies of the #FakeNews ?
Why wasn’t she charged?
Yeah like we miss cancer. You are cancerous rot and you were cut out more to follow and healing to begin MAGA

Trump as a Russian asset time to shut it down
Okay keep us updated on who your friends are. 
Ouch.
My FBI sources tell me the real reason the writer of this piece, Josh Campbell, one of @comey and #McCabe's allies, is leaving the Bureau is because he was offered and accepted a VERY lucrative gig with @CNN to throw shade on the scandal.

…
That explains the tweet and the umbrellas. Thanks.
This explains why they’re pink.
He is very likely a “dirty cow” like yourself running for the door.
Throwing shade on the corruption of the FBI under your command is gonna be a full time  job for him!
#ReleaseTheComeyMemo
You are a CRIMINAL! Can't wait for your Prison sentence. Like ANYONE would want advise from you!
We don’t feel sorry for your buddy leaving. That’s his choice if he wants to throw his career away to support criminals and liars like you. If he was anything like you we don’t need him in there anyway! #DrainTheSwamp
WEASEL!!
Josh, the men/women of the FBI r not under investigation, just a few bad apples at the top. If that's why ur leaving...that's a cop out....
@POTUS was sheer genius in firing you. And his voice is an important addition to the national conversation.

Plus your corrupt & 100% verified leaker.

PS U were FIRED & thank GOD
Josh Campbell is reported to be leaving for a lucrative gig appearing on CNN - then he will write a book. If he truly cared for the FBI he would welcome transparency because that is the only thing that will restore confidence in the institution.
The sacrifice of Josh Campbell to leave a job he loves because it restricts his voice to protect that agency, is more then commendable. Country before self! Teaching: Ones actions can give amplification & support to words being spoken. His voice will be heard!

FBI Official: FBI Agents Threatened Physical Harm to President Trump In Missing FBI Texts & Other “Frightening” Communications http://ow.ly/TX0830j0Cx6 
I will stand by the @FBI

My FBI sources tell me the real reason the writer of this piece, Josh Campbell, one of @comey and #McCabe's allies, is leaving the Bureau is because he was offered and accepted a VERY lucrative gig with @CNN to throw shade on the scandal.

…
Josh Campbell penned a New York Times Op-Ed on Friday, claiming he was leaving the FBI because of “relentless attacks on the bureau,” but on Monday he proved his column was disingenuous by quickly signing with CNN. He had a deal already in the works! More fake news from CNN
an important addition to the propaganda arm of the deep state
I'm praying for all Our FBI Agents. May God Protect and look over those who serve and those who have served.
"What this issue is all about: whether the Department of Justice and FBI, under President Obama, abused their surveillance authority against American citizens and political opponents. Put another way: was the Obama DOJ weaponized to spy on the Trump campaign?"

--CnsrvtvTreehouse
Pillar #1
I'm so surprised at how cocky you are when you actually started the trouble for FBI our government,  the people of America and our president. You even went to president-elect Trump and told him about the fake dossier in Trump Tower and then kept notes. And you knew it was fake.
And why did you keep notes? Because you knew you were working on a insurance plan to get @realDonaldTrump out of office it wasn't because you didn't trust him it's because you were trying to hang him. No one's going to buy your book because no one trusts you
YOU were fired for being CORRUPT!  If you have nothing to hide, release the documents- your discussions with Obama!  you won't! you'll just further lie to the American people! YOU are CORRUPT! you sold your soul!
