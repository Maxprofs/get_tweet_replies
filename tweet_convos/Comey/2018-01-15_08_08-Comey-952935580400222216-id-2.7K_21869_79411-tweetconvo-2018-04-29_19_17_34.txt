The FBI plotted to "neutralize" Martin Luther King Jr, attacking him as a "filthy, abnormal animal."

The FBI blackmailed and threatened MLK. The FBI surveilled him. The FBI did everything it could to stop him.
https://www.alternet.org/fbi-honors-martin-luther-king-jr-50-years-after-plotting-neutralize-him … #MLKDay
The real Martin Luther King Jr. was a revolutionary who was arrested 30 times for standing up against white supremacy, capitalism, and imperialism.

The US government made MLK's life hell when he was alive. In his death, it has tried to whitewash and exploit him.

#MLKDay
The late 60's were a very unstable time in this country.
I can't convey the angst of the time. I'm sure there are dozens of books in the library about those times. Read one.
We are living in a time filled with angst. Times change but people don't.
Yes, but we did survive that and then Watergate. And we will survive this. It will.take a looong time to get the country  back in order. But we will survive.
Hope you’re right!  Rome-Egypt-others fell. We’re not immune. We’ve really screwed up allowing T (the snake ) in, but, as he says we knew he was a  when we bought him. Pray daily we do survive. #OurRevolution #TheResistanceVOTES #BernieSanders #ResistTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
Um, no one "allowed" Trump in. He was elected, for better or worse. That's our system. Get over it already.
Putin put him in office, not the American voters. The only way Trump could win is to cheat. One year from now once the Blue Wave has swept through the country, we can start the Impeachment!
Yes, sure, I (and prob most others) am familiar with the Birmingham Jail Letter. But why doesn't @Comey quote the really relevant passage: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." For example, why didn't @Comey respond to the complaints I sent him/DOJ/FBI?
Comey: On MLK Day I thank the Lord Jesus that we have a President who is HONEST and who loves WE THE PEOPLE regardless of the color of our skin.
"we have a president who is Honest and who loves WE THE PEOPLE" man this is one funny troll account! lol
Yes indeed we do Sheppard and it’s glorious. Thank God for President Trump.
Jesus would think that you are brain washed by CIA Operation Mockingbird.
Yes, I believe you are brainwashed.  Give my regards to Comey.
Wow! How did that feel? Did that feel good? Insulting him like that? did you feel like a big boy? Wow! What a tough guy you are Lauri! #Sad
Wow! We are literally reliving those darkest moments and Martin Luther. King is inspiring us to fight for racial EQUALITY AGAIN..but AGAINST TRUMP!
how come you’re not reading the letter the FBI wrote to him to convince him to kill himself?
#ReleaseTheMemo 
I find this more appropriate
What about the anonymous letter from the FBI, which tried to blackmail him into suicide? #ReleaseTheMemo
The DC corruption will have sunlight soon! Everybody will then know Comey is a crooked cop!
James Comey: you are so full of !! You quote scripture and famous people who gave their lives for what they believed in... while you've done nothing but lie and subvert this nation for personal gain. Sierra-Tango-Foxtrot-Union!
Watching old speeches of MLK and JFK talk about a future of brotherhood (and sisterhood) amongst Americans. Will we ever have leaders like that again?
But #Comey made up the #Fergusoneffect to discredit protests against killer police. You also started the next stage of surveillance against black people with #BlackIdentityExtremist designation. STFU about King. 
.@BenjaminNorton
If MLK were alive he would be opposed to the injustice #kendrickJohnson received from YOUR FBI! Don’t play sympathetic take action!
Uhm he's out of office.  What action would you like him to take?  #kendrickjohnson
Wow that’s ridiculous. He needs to read the news #kendrickjohnson is a Race Hoax
Nope I rarely watch TV. I read a lot. I think the #kendrickjohnson case file over 600 pages. It’s a Race Hoax
@SamEllison11 you are talking to a person that is ten deep in factual misstatements.  #2stupid2engage  Move on she's terminally stupid. #kendrickjohnson
I have no idea why you would say that about Comey.  I don't know what your obsession with him stems from but help is out there. #kendrickjohnson
#ReleaseTheMemo 

Tick Tock........

Keep trying to stir the pot of racial division. 

It wont divert our attention to IG Horowitz's prelim report or the 323 sealed indictments between Little Rock, NY, D.C, Florida, California and Philly.
Speaking about Jail, you must be feeling pretty Queasy right about now being you're heading for one. My guesstimate is a nice 40 to Life Stretch. Unless you Sing like a Canary. Then you'll only get 25. Gotta love them Fed Guidelines, hey Jimmy boy? But the sad part (p1)
(2) Is you'll most likely get sent to that cushy Fed Camp in Fairton, NJ where All High Profiles go in stead of a Federal Pen where some of the guys you put away will be. Now that would be True Justice, wouldn't it Jimmy?
 You dirty, dirty cop. Tick Tock

Did you ever read the almost 300 EEOC complaints filed against the agency you used to lead? Racial & sexual discrimination, harrassment & abuse? Settlements over $150million. Quite a culture of corruption & systematic abuse, huh Jim?
Since you were FIRED the hope is that the DARK CLOUDS AROUND YOUR CRIMINAL CORRUPTION ARE EXPOSED& THE LIGHT OF THE SUN SHINES ON IT!
PATHETIC ALERT:
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a TARGET of your @FBI!
He would have DESPISED YOU.
You have such a history of deep racial divide, that is still so relevant today. I don't remember so much importance being placed on it in recent memory. Until Trump, I believed that real progress had been made. Unfortunately, it seems to come back with a vengeance.
Please send to Trump and his treason troop for their jail time @Comey  #TrumpRussia
Let’s hope the jail you end up in has no internet kiosk. 
Shut up. The only thing we want read is your indictment.
did you read the rest of it or just that one part
On MLK day, i would like to read your description of the hillary clinton emails investigation but  #PeterStrzok changed the wording

You're embarrassing yourself please stop.
Expect more of this if Dr. King's dream continues to be only a dream.

 “#InconvenientMLK / #ReclaimMLK”
Grt Wrk Mr Comey.Much appreciation and respect.
Shld do a talk show Comey's Coner" politics,biz, sports n music etc.
I think it is more how you turned the @FBI into the Federal Bureau of Insurrection. Your days of freedom are numbered.  3, 2, 1, ...

It's evident to me, Comey did not want to die on Clinton Hill, but was willing to die on Trump Hill. WHY?

Because on Clinton Hill, you really die! #MAGA #ClintonCrimeFamily #ClintonBodyCount
It’s nice to see the FBI still reads Dr. King’s mail.
@realDonaldTrump Said.. #YoureFired #HowdyDoody  @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer @timkaine @RepTimWalz
Earth to spaceships. Comey not responsible for Hoover's administration but he is personally responsible for dicking up America's chance to have its first Madam President who is overqualify compared the goon we have in the WH today.
You're a flunkie. Know so many agents who used to respect you. Looser. I'll take it back if you working with #Qanon but I doubt it.... but I'll give you benefit of the doubt. Disinformation is necessary
Put a sock in it. Thx.
This might be touching, Mr. Comey, if anyone on the planet could believe a word you say.
 Comey 
Still appropriate but applies to a dark sinister #USA fuelled by a #toxic #mentallyill #POTUS. Denounce #racism; build thru #inclusiveness!
You were the face of institutional opposition to MLK and his legacy.
Nice read Mr Comey. TY for sharing.
Please, oh wise one, tell us again about dark clouds. Like the dark cloud you left over the corrupt #FBI But never fear, Justice ALWAYS prevails and your time is coming. #LockHimUp
In 1987 Trump was denied a casino permit in Australia for money-laundering & mafia ties. The FBI KNEW he was a criminal, you belong behind bars.
Dear Mr Comey,
"Let us all hope that the dark clouds of FBI corruption will soon pass away... and in some not too distant tomorrow the iron bars of justice and confinement will slam down over you and your swamp of criminals!"
#DrainTheSwamp #LockHimUp
#GrossNegligence
1968-Hate killed Rev. King, Jr. and it is killing our nation, one slur & one unkind thought at a time. 2018-Shift in Consciousness: "I'm not greater or less than you are, and you are not greater or less than I am." Live these words-WE ARE ONE. #TimesUp for hate; #Time2Heal !
On MLK day I like 2 remember #CoIntelPro & the letter to King from J. Edgar Hoover admonishing King 2 kill himself.
You kept quiet about Trump’s http://treason.You  elected the worst racist in modern history.Keep Dr King’s name out of your complicit mouth.
I like to call out your immeasurable hypocrisy
#ReleaseTheDamnMemoNOW #FireComey #FireMueller
Corruption is the ultimate reason for harsh disciplinary action!!!!
Here’s hoping people will someday read your letters that you wrote while in prison.  I’d also like to read Hillary’s and Barry’s.
Maybe Hillary will become a prison artist like John Wayne Gacy. I'd say they have a lot in common. Oh sorry, they're all "suicides."
Screw you. Because of you we have to live the worst human being leading The United States of America
Comey sent the letter classified to Jason Chaffetz who declassified letter and released it with the assistance of Rudy Giuliani who talked to msm about the October surprise...
I hope the radiant glow of arrests and indictments shines over everyone in the @donaldtrump adminstration and all of its enablers in the @GOP.
Thank you for your service Mr. Comey and for not backing down before a lying, corrupt, undemocratic, tyranical, crooked, Russian owned, disgeaceful and pathetic Donald Trump.
HEAR! HEAR!
Please don’t ever quote MLK. You couldn’t shine his shoes. He’d roll over in his grave if he knew what you did..
Tell em Mr Parker!!
Thank you for this sir. We see what you are doing. You are brave. You are one step closer and when you are ready know you have a community that will support you.

We couldnt trust the government then & we still cant today. Racist, White, wealth hoarders present more of a threat to us now than at any other time in history
Amen!
Tick tock!
I think the next letter you read will be from your cell in Gitmo.
This will only happen if people, of all races, are willing to stand up to racism and bigotry. Even if it means standing up to men of great power. America is starving for a leadership.
it wasnt written to you, fash
Shut up @Comey. You helped Trump win.
"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death. Martin Luther King Jr. The real #mlk with the FBI file. #ReclaimMLK
Please spare me. You damaged the one thing we the people of any race and color have in common: the right to vote freely to elect with no outside influeces. So don't insult us by quoting #MLKDay2018. Shame on you.
I miss you
Can you please come back?
No worries. #TheStormIsHere
Let us all hope that the corruption will soon pass away and in some not too distant tomorrow all the corruption will be held accountable to this great nation. Tic Tock Comey.....
Stop with the evolved platitudes - you helped get a racist elected
It’s too bad the field officers in western NY didn’t read this before piling persecution onto the candidate who better embodies MLKs words. Too bad a set of mostly duplicate emails weren’t better vetted b4  submitting letter to partisan congress as 11th hour fodder. All too bad.
Dr. King was part of the problem not the solution!!!!! I see some of my people still sleeping huh
I make my students read this. It is an important letter. 

Why is MLK in jail for marching when the Sheriff broke the law by not issuing a permit to the marchers.
#MartinLutherKingJrDay #MartinLutherKing #MLKDay2018 #MLKDay #MLKJrDay #MLK #Peace #UNITY  #IHaveADream
Thank you for all you’ve done and all you continue to do.
You are in the Birmingham jail? Are they the holding you there before they take you to Gitmo for you treason tribunal?
Hey remember that time that the FBI tried to blackmail MLK? What about that time the FBI wrote him a letter saying that he should kill himself?
COINTELPRO
You're going down, bad cop, weasel, Comey

#ReleaseTheMemo
.@mattgaetz: "The allegations contained in this important intelligence document go to the very foundations of our democracy and they require an immediate release to the public in my opinion." 
FBI spied on MLK because they thought he was colluding with the Soviets!   Sounds familiar
Amazing how Comey gets on twitter like he’s some relevant iconic source of integrity and character.  Good gawd, stop humiliating yourself. #SitDown.
As a woman of color, an immigrant who came here at age 4 (almost 50 years ago) and a lawyer, I am afraid of the nazis and white supremacists in the White House and the Congress. This is where we are. I’m thinking of fleeing if Trump isn’t removed soon. Tell #Mueller to hurry.
“My grandmother was a typical white person.”

—Your former boss
That's Wright Mr.Comey hit the talk show circuit and spill the true talk on President Pee Pee and that family of his as well as the whole Trump administration including Sara Huckleby.
And in 2018 we are still hoping - still dreaming. #MLK

How does Strzok still have a job in the US Govt?  This comment referencing 'ignorant hillbillies in Loundoun county' VA refers to the campaign of Jill McCabe wife of FBI agent Kevin McCabe @repcomstock …
Donald Trump and his administration’s “Trumpist” Resorts gusting how did this happen to us how did this Idiocracy happened to us?
Oh great! Are you an inmate @BirminghamJail
Sad fact is, MSM and Dems don’t want the fact that MOST conservatives ARE NOT RACIST! Unless u ask divisive politicians who rely on and exploit minorities FOR VOTES ONLY!!  Dems r evil purveyors of Biased & Deceitful Misinformation re: minorities/women/LGBTQ...
Interesting that MLK wrote the letter from JAIL: after being targeted for years by the FBI...and you left out th best part!
"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."

Did you chose Birmingham jail to read the letter from, because you're currently touring the country's jails to get an idea of what your retirement home is going to look like?

Nice!
I hope you like wearing the color orange.
One day you are reading a letter from jail & the next you will be writing letters from jail.
#ReleaseTheMemo
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you? Bad boy
Tic....toc....tic.....toc....
Hi there leaky Comey, have anything to say before D-day? “With great power, comes great responsibility” you failed miserably!#Disgraceful #ReleasetheMemo
Such a deep thinker.  Deep state thinker.
#releasethedocuments
Maybe soon, Jim, you will be able to pen your own letter from jail? #ReleaseTheMemo
The public will soon be reading current documents. Won't that be great, Jimmy? The other leg on your stool just collapsed.
Maybe you can request to be sent to Birmingham Jail when they nail your ass for treason.
Dont you love the smell of #TRUTH & #JUSTICE in the morning?

Looks like the @BarackObama DOJ & @Comey FBI  will be burned shortly.

Ron @RepDeSantis has something to say along with ( so far ) 7 others...
Every day I think of how you sold your soul to the Devil and broke countless laws to protect the most corrupt politician of all time. You may fool some people, but you can’t fool everyone.
What resonated with you, jail as the location? Thinking to the future?

Meanwhile in the real world millions of insignificant American citizens have had their lives ruined by a corrupt, narcisstic, elitist, government who flagrantly broke the law for their own greed and power. 
That's socialism for you.
So Comey used Fake Dossier to get a FISA warrant and colluded with DNC?Isn't that a felony?
Jim Jim Jim, if I've told you once I've told you a hundred times - NEVER BEND OVER TO PICK UP THE SOAP.
WHAT IS THE STEELE DOSSIER?

The Steele Dossier was a hastily cobbled together justification for two things:…
You’re a Crook Comey!!
Thank you Sir.
Maybe next year you can read his letter from jail, in jail.
Personally, I'm looking forward to reading the letter that YOU will write to us from jail.
Maybe someday YOU will be writing letters from jail??  Why don’t YOU take the path your FBI suggested to Dr. King?  Save us the expense of a sh*tshow trial for ya???  Do you even realize how sanctimonious you sound???

Now how did we make it happen in the current environment
But. Her. Emails.
Mr. Comey, with all due respect, your actions helped put a monster into the White House.
The only time we’ve had problems with racism and more pronounced when Obama was in office for eight years

You’re going to jail you disgrace
It resonates super hard right now because James Comey kneecapped Clinton and now we have a racist in the White House.
Good thing you are reading a letter that was written in a jail.  Get used to reading your own from a jail.
Can't help yourself, can you?
Have you gobe down to Birmingham Jail and seen if there is any unjustly condemned? Or the likes ?...
Doesn't matter, standing on MLKs grave wont help you. 
Go to the foot of the cross. You're a crim.
You would have thrown him in jail you pig.
Let us all hope for the dark clouds of the Clinton regime to be drained & locked away in a shithole!! That means you too Comey!
When you go to prison with your fellow Obama, Hillary and family
You kne everything @Comey   EVERY SINGLE THING. And still, you persecuted Clinton w/o good faith!  Can you sleep at night that you were a significant factor in inflicting #ShitholePresident on ???
Great quote. I still haven't forgiven you. Everyday I wake up to a nightmare and feel sick for my children and grandchildren.

Beautiful, still to this day. Absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately, we're still waiting for the clear night sky. RIP MLK
Comey the  stain on the integrity of the.@FBI. 

Dirty cop.
Love those letters.
DID YOU LIKE FUNCTIONS ADDED TO TWITTER BY ME
Im very eager to see what @realDonaldTrump, Mueller and @jeffsessions have in store. I do believe @JulianAssange is going to help bring down the cabal. #qanon #thestorm
Eat shit you smug cumstain.
On MLK DAY IN YEARS TO COME YOU YOURSELF WILL BE READING FROM PRISON.
Don't worry when you're in prison for treason you can work on your own humanitarian quote.  Tick tock
We are not free. We do not care enough yet. We have no right to hurt or kill for the color of skin. I am an American. I care. I do no harm. #RacismMustFall 2018. Not waiting for others to NOT do something to rid Racism 
The Letter from Birmingham Jail is worth reading start to finish, one of the most elegant pieces of persuasive language ever.
I hope in the not to distant future that you will be writing letters from Birmingham jail.
You're one to preach to us?!  Isn't it strange that after being found to be a liar, no one listens to you anymore?
Such beautiful words I pray... Come true 
Watch Selma. That FBI dir destroyed his life!
Every tweet Mr. C you eloquently BUST PresiDONT UN @realdonaldtrump!!! Thankyou sir, thankyou very much on behalf of all of SANE Americans.
Our Nation Will Never Have Brotherhood
Unless We Come Together Aganist the Gang
That Seperates Us.
This is What The Great Segregation @hellzkichin 
is About. Listen To It.
Mr. Comey. You are an American hero and I have much respect for you and those in FBI and CIA who put justice and patriotism over party. If we lose truth and justice, we lose all that this country stands for and those that have died protecting ford for.
I heard this letter earlier today. An amazing testament to Kings life and beliefs, hard to believe he’s writing that from jail. No self pity, only the belief in a better place to raise his family. He was taken far too soon.
@Comey

On this day we are reminded how the FBI targeted and attempted to blackmail and silence MLK.

You Mr hypocritical FBIman, have no moral authority to quote or speak for MLK.

http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_federal_bureau_of_investigation_fbi/ …
So many years later, and still but a hope.
Why did you send that GD letter
We are shining his dream of brotherhood and love;
The power of a few casts illusions of small and passing shadows that disappear in the sunny and compassionate citizenry of America!
Comey is the worst kind of Criminal, what he did was harmful to ALL Americans of every color.
He is a member of the Satanic Globalists/Elitist working to Destroy what America Stands for!
He has Blood on his hands and it will all come out, so buckel up & get ready, Mind Blowing!
Too bad Hoover and his FBI hated MLK. Maybe if you guys didn't attack everyone like evil communists back then we'd have a better world now. Now thanks to you guys we have traitor trump.
And the #ShitholePresident will fade to Black...
