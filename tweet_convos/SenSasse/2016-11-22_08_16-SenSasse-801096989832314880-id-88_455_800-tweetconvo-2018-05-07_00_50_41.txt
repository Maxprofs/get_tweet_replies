I'm glad to hear you say this. Last time we had the keys to everything, we spent like drunken sailors.
Who gave you that power Senator? Who was wrong about President Trump. That would be you, you MORON.
we'll have 2 restrain trump
If you don't make it non functional!!!.as it tends to do.
I wish @SenSasse was my Senator. I could move to Nebraska but it  boring (sorry @BenSasse). @baker_linda1 @FedSoc
We've spoken of limited gov't while out of power. We now have the opportunity to model that restraint when we're the ones in power. @FedSoc 
Republicans Have NEVER EVER followed through in power. Better a deficit building U.S than bombing 3rd world countries.
Now we have to get it right.
#DennyHastertWrestlingBuddies
And the ones who will stand in your way are the "moderate" REPUBLICANS who aren't conservative or Republicans at all.
so quit bashing Trump and push him in the right direction!
Thank you, I hope this is true. Seems many R's may be willing to deepen the deficit with unpaid tax cuts though.
Just for the sake of it? I'm guessing you don't mean limiting Trump's power?
no. I mean if he believes what he says get rid of hastert rule in house. Gop abused power in defeating dem amend.
@petefrt @FedSoc
Good luck with that.
the clock is ticking on you Ben you will be out next. Listen to the people. Go TRUMP
I agree with Senator but also hope that He had moxy to have met w/#PresidentElectTrump to give him congrats + full support
@DrZuhdiJasser @FedSoc I'd like to see Ben back in the private sector ASAP #GOPSabotage He was willing to lose #SCOTUS instead!
@TimothySandefur @FedSoc I'm not holding my breath, but I'm thankful for men like Sasse who believe the above.
damn right! Now you have the power to limit your power and influence.  Limit or lose power.   #bringbacktheWhigs
@jaketapper @FedSoc Nebraska: Get a new Senator.
@jaketapper @FedSoc 
Cut IRS.
Cut EPA.
Cut Agencies across board.
Cut all government.
Cut Federal Regulations.
Govern
We will see.
+ cut taxes, reduce the budget & trade inbalances, fix the tax code, get tough on crime & replace ObamaCare @SenSasse @SpencerJCox @FedSoc
@jaketapper @FedSoc if you think Rare going to limit gov'twhen they have the keys, you prob believe Trumps campaign promises too
Stop it. Everybody knows that Rs don't really want limited gov't when they're in charge
what about the house yesterday holding up time to change 5gop votes to defeat fed lgbt contract amend. to fail after pass
does that mean house and senate dem compromise amendments? Ill believe it when i see it.
dream on.
So right Senator.
Aren't Federalists more inclined to want a strong centralized government, as opposed to Anti-Federalists?
@jaketapper @FedSoc U all will do what u always do. Trash the economy, start wars, tax breaks to the rich. Cut help to the poor
impossible. Restraint isn't part of their vocabulary.
@jaketapper @FedSoc  The ones that voted for Trump received more from the government than any other group in US. Rich getting rich
yeah, good luck with that
@jaketapper @FedSoc unless of course you are talking abt women, LGBT, POC, immigrants etc
I've just closed my eyes again, climbed aboard the dream weaver train...
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I needed that..
@jaketapper @FedSoc No thanks to you Ben.
If you cared about your country you would use your power to get rid of the disgrace thats going to lead.
@jaketapper @FedSoc And all that crying past 8 years all BS you guys will not do a thing
Restraint isn't a word I'd associate with Trump, and the GOP only cares about limited Government when a Democrat is POTUS.
@JohnJHarwood @FedSoc - Spin how you want but there is a mandate for the democrats.
You guys say that all the time.
REAGAN BALLOONED 'BIG GOVERNMENT'
We should just do the right things: cut gov. waste and hubris, but uphold our honor and assets...  Simple, could work
How did that virtue-signalling #NeverTrump thing work out for you? He won without you. Don't need to hear from you yet.
@jaketapper @FedSoc Are the powers that be still speaking with you? Good luck with that!
@jaketapper @FedSoc hahahahha
@BenSasse Over/under on number of days it takes post-inauguration to completely disregard all of this?
That's not the way this works.
:all you do is give lectures.Go back to Midland.
@JohnJHarwood @FedSoc just as soon as I tell you what to do with your vagina
@BobsFunGirl @FedSoc funny when you're out of power, you talk about limited government. Let's see what you do and say now.
@JohnJHarwood @FedSoc This is the genius who fell for the fake paid protester story.
@JohnJHarwood @FedSoc With fuzzy math.
Don't count on it. The top of your ticket has much different ideas.
you would earn a great deal of respect from potential crossovers, but I’m skeptical of the party’s ability to take the high road

@JohnJHarwood @FedSoc Does that mean you'll leave women alone?
Senator, Will you oppose Trump's plans to add $7 trillion to the national debt?
$1trillion spending blows your premise out of water right way.
So can we assume you won't vote to confirm any nominees who don't complete disavow voter suppression?
- Didn't his colleagues just vote to allow federal contractors to fire gay employees?  Small government?
@KhurramDara @FedSoc uh, have you heard what sessions has in mind? Delusional. Civil forfeiture. Aggressive marijuana enforcement
: Might this be the playbook for modeling restraint: http://www.theamericancapitalistparty.com/ ? Looking forward to your substantive comments.
One can hope. That ship sailed over 100 years ago.
“What’s glorious…” Great turn of phrase, Senator.
chances of this happening:  zero.
Those of us who value small government  are counting on you Senator to ensure @realDonaldTrump doesn't abuse power.
or anyone else for that matter...
impressive, i didn't anyone other than @realDonaldTrump could jam that much crapola into 140 characters.
