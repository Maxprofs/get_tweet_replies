You are all loony. There is nothing wrong w/ meeting with the Russian ambassador, especially if it's to promote positive relations
You are loony, he committed perjury. He met with him in private after there was allegations of interference.
As a senator, not as a campaign surrogate, so technically no. Interference? You mean exposing gov. corruption?
You do realize that IF the Russians did hack at all, the only actual example of it given so far is Wikileaks...
which exposed corruption at a time when it was relevant for us, the people. Oh, SO malicious. Where's the justice
for all the crimes revealed through the leaks? Seems like "justice" to you is merely a political tool. Pathetic.
Way beyond recusal. After he resigns, there's only 1 Question. IS HE JUST A WITNESS, OR IS HE A TARGET OF THE INVESTIGATION?
going to tweet next while you @GOP Senators roll your eyes at him and laugh up your sleeves at his supporters? MOVE THE BALL.
the dems would love nothing more than for u to listen to conspiracy theorists & let GOP go down w/ this scandal.
As a Republican, it's refreshing to see that not every prominent GOPer is rushing to defend another @realDonaldTrump tantrum.
You voted for this guy. You are responsible. Period.
#CaineMutiny lesson #1: post Trump's weekend rant re missing #strawberries - compassion & rule of law before relieving him of duty
presumably specious and should be treated as such until the intelligence community claims otherwise. You @SenateGOP are like cats
The allegation is they hacked the idiot @johnpodesta ? What else?
Recusal not enough #SessionsMustResign.#SessionsLied he disqualified himself during hearing under OATH.#SpecialProsecutor #Russia
Demand special prosecutor-Flynn, Page,Sessions,Ross,Kushner ,Trump Inc Duetche Bank connections clear. FISA WT will prove it!!
chasing a laser pointer. The American people have finally given you the ENTIRE GOVERNMENT. Give the @POTUS a cabinet and get busy
Sessions has committed perjury.  Stand up and require his resignation.
Of course not liberal hypocrisy.
@BenSasse It's imperative that your probe take this wherever it leads. NO obstruction by @DevinNunes
#Trumprussia
#russiagate
thanks for speaking for American citizens, not solely RNP
Thank you sir!
Thank you, now let's get to work!
monitors tried to find it, before the election, and they came up with a goose egg. It follows that the entire Russia narrative is
Warrant or no warrant: The point is that if there had been any impropriety between Trump's campaign and Russia, these clandestine
No pal it is the WRONG decision and @real_sessions w support of @realDonaldTrump should retract immediately.
He perjured himself and should resign, but I'm relieved you are putting country before party. Please urge fellow Repubs to do same
He did not. Listen to the vomplete5 question that was ask. He didn't  lie.
gang members and thugs always hate rats.
Have you no decency, sir?
AG Jeff Sessions should NOT have recused himself nor did he have anything to apologize for.  You sound like a damned liberal.
When will we see a statement on who authorized surveillance of Trump associates and why or who leaked them to #HRC campaign?
Right! But only through Independent Investigation. #independentlisteningtorepublican
enacting a conservative slate of ideas. Do you think we don't notice you're sitting around eating popcorn wondering what Trump's
@CHSommers It's people like Saase/Obama working to undermine USA for self-pres. Q 4 Ben: Have u @ pedophile arrests? More coming.
Thank you for your stand Senator Sasse. We need to ensure our country is safe and it does not feel that way at this time..
Back out President. You are as bad as the Democratics.  Some of you are  going to cause us to lose seat and them back in power.
please continue your watch; history will look on you kindly for standing up to trump--know it's not easy to buck your party
nice to know your still sabotaging the republicans for your future!
you never went to law school. Nor did your intern.
''''''Sasse! Whose side are you own! You don't sound like your on President Trump's side!
Just in case you're open to actually looking at malfeasance by Obama Admin:
why don't you express outrage that private citizens who were working for a presidential candidate were systematically spied upon?
Please elaborate why are you not supporting President Trump?!
Shame u didn't put same effort in uncovering ALL the HRC issues as u do pursuing everything anti #POTUS #MAGA #TRUMP
Thank you, Sir, for standing up for our democracy. God is watching our so-called leaders now, and will separate wheat from chaff.
#Sessions like you must resign to protect America.  #FireSessions #SessionsLied
A sitting president wire tapped a political opponent in a presidential campaign #ObamaGate
And will there be an investigation of US meddling in foreign governments?    https://williamblum.org 
Thank you, Senator, for putting country first.
you had best stand by Sessions and Trump or out you go!
@MargaretHoover Martha Stewart did less and went to jail.
Once respected you,now I loathe you.  Where is your statement demanding a full investigation into the leaks? An actual crime
loss of conservative support&guaranteed opposition to your reelection!enjoy your time on networks& its regurgitation! U r Toast !
No it's not. He has done nothing wrong. The line of questioning was SPECIFICALLY about Trump Campaign NOT Senatorial duties @SenSasse
DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT or change parties. Traitor.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #DrainTheSwamp
Agree that we deserve investigation into Russia interference in US government, including WH ties & financial conflicts of interest
Agree that we have a public trust crisis. We can't trust AG to fulfill his role. He compromised his credibility. Must resign.
Who needs enemies...
Country > Party , UNITED (not Divided) State of America is on your side!
Thank you, Senator Sasse.
@GOP loses more & more credibility every day the buffoon is in office. Country over party- investigate #RussiaTies for ALL of us!
This goes here .. not on your personal twitter .. I fixed it for you.
my statement on wiretapping... 
Thank you, for putting the interests of your entire country first.
We don't trust Congress, Senator. Appoint an independent, bipartisan committee with subpoena power. NOW, Senator.
Sessions lied under oath. He's the Attorney General. This is unacceptable & you know it. Stand up for once. Action. Not empty rhetoric.
Lynch met Bill on s tarmac, Holder fast and furious. You- silent freaking hypocrite!
We need to purge ourselves of the compromised #Trump administration. #Russia wants to hurt us. I don't want #Putin in my life!
Session was prepared and knew what he was answering and needs to Resign or #Impeachsessions
Thank You Sir! This is not partisan for us innocent Americans. We just want to know that no foreign Gov Is interfering in our Gov.
if it is revealed thru tax returns that Trump had large business deals w Russian oligarchs, is this enough to demand resignation?
it's imperative we know what's happening. Maybe it was Russia?
Dear @SenSasse, I am losing faith that a Republican-led investigation will be impartial. We need an independent special prosecutor, please!
Yes, thank you for putting country before party.
YES!
That's how easy it's supposed to be.
There is a concern, a recusal, an investigation, and we move on.
No bickering needed.
Agreed on recusal @SenSasse but no AG can serve if found guilty of perjury, per ABA. When 42 was, GOP had him disbarred, began impeachment.
Sessions must RESIGN. Recusal is not enough. Trump must be IMPEACHED.
Just wanted to thank you for your intelligent statement today on the wire tapping. I'm an Iowan independent voter. Thank you!!!
Totally agree; however Sessions has only recused himself from campaign probe. We need independent investigation into whole matter.
Also requires Whacko partisan dem Libs to get real and serve people instead of advancing nonsense
Thanks!  one of the few rational  Rs now.  PLz Demand independent investigation to get to the bottom of this!! Country First!!
KUDOS for courage.  The the truth come out, whatever it is. Most Americans are with you. NOT partisan
rebuild public trust?? Are you kidding? Blow hards like you is the reason there is no trust!! Until we remove the likes of U none
Are you concerned at all about illegal wiretapping or can you overcome your bias towards DT?
He's your man, the head of your party.  Be a patriot and save us from this madness.
Thank you, Senator. I hope your colleagues will follow your lead.
I have been waiting for you to speak up. Thanks.
why don't we just start with his taxes
Thank you. An independent investigation would be better.
Horsefeathers.
Senator, when will we have open hearings? @SenSasse
good start. Next steps: resignation and full independent investigation. Do the right thing.
Putin is now interfering in the French election.His efforts to undermine Western democracy should shock us all.
House & Senate panel chairs called reporters to undermine story about contacts with Russians? Not OK! Independent investigation!
Recusal not enough! What are the chances a prosecutor didn't know he was lying through omission? And lying outright.
He broke the law by lying to the Senate and the American people under oath. He needs to be investigated.
You must do the right thing.
you must admit that is not enough. That is the bare minimum. We will still have a political appointee who reports in charge
Thank you sir!
You didn't do your job during the vetting process of confirmation asking the right questions,instead  just rubber stamped a friend
The only trust crisis the American people have is with you and your colleagues.
Recusal is not enough. This investigation requires an independent prosecutor with no ties to the Trump administration. Make it so.
@MomCLW Even when they win, republicans always snatch agony of defeat instead of joy of victory! Looks like leftist plan working!
@mindyfinn did you know he was meeting with him and the purpose? We're you invited?
And you will be investigating this when?
which can only be done by independent group give confidence to citizens. Also, sessions LIED under oath. Top lawman ! He must go
@Jamomom93 DJT may have another firing on his hands.
Recusal better be the end of it. The Dems are playing the only card they have - accusations with NO proof. Don't play their games.
Trump can't flush the toilet without our own #IC putting him on blast. You've got no problem with that. HACK.
which your own office would fall into dysfunction. Which, If you and #Marco want to be RINO hacks: great, but no more civics, OK?
this open collusion between our own #IC and the media to embarrass, deprive Trump of the minimal level of confidentiality without
mine public confidence in the legitimacy of the 2016 presidential election. Big champion of the Constitution and you're dignifying
You have neither evidence that Russian "spooks" are at work here. On the contrary, our own "spooks" are actively working to under-
Good move. Thank you.
this is a good example of why Ben Sasse is NOT conservative.  Moderates bend over backwards to lose.
Since the DEMS will fight until Session leaves gov or Trump is impeached...I don't see accepting DEMS premise,we lose
Recusal is not the appropriate response to perjury. Sessions must resign. Restore confidence - we need independent investigation.
THE PROBLEM IS YOU PPL HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY MEDDLING IN THIS ELECTION,EXCEPT FAKE NEWS COMING FROM THE DEMS & MSM,GROW SPINS
As a constituent from @SpeakerRyan district want to thank you for putting our country first.This has to be Congress #1 priority.
how is this good or the right decision?  There is no proof and only a fake news story from CNN that was questions by Al Franken?
where's the #IndependentInvestigation ?
@mindyfinn it's not enough. Mr. Sessions lied to the Senate. How can we trust him@to@impartialy enforce the law. Credibility shot.

please move to Oklahoma and become my Senator.
thank you sir.
You mean except for the complete lack of any evidence that Putin is doing any such thing?
lead from behind much? This was clear weeks ago.
I'm a democrat and like and respect you. Don't screw it up.
thank you! As lifelong GOP, asking for AG resignation as well. He talked abt Ukraine. Need AG prepared to stand up to manipulator.
recusal isn’t enough. You know this. Must step down.
thank you Senator
time for #Toughlove for the GOP the longer they dismiss this the worse it looks. Sessions, Page, Flynn, and now Kushner?
"Treasonous Trump" and "Racist Lying Sessions" going down Lock em up, or better yet public hanging in the town square
Don't we need a special prosecutor? These leaks show that we don't know how deep this goes, and DAG is also a Trump appointee.
I'm more concerned with the Americans in elected & appointed office who are colluding w/Russia. @SenSasse
Glad you are on board @SenSasse but only tip of the iceberg of meddling. Read up on the web of ties @Khanoisseur
quit trying to get media time with the #FakeNewsMedia and do the job Nebraska tax payers sent you to do
Unfortunately, "Putin's oligarchy of crooks and spooks" already includes Trump admin. That's the whole point here. They're in bed.
@mindyfinn WE NEED A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR!
Can you please clarify if you support AG Sessions recusal from ALL Trump/Russia investigations - not just limited "campaign" ones
you know this is bull put out by Trump haters you need to get to work on repealing ACA and tax cuts time to quit this foolishness
Talk is cheap, Senator. What are YOU prepared to do to protect our country?
well said sir
@ReaganBattalion Are you going to investigate US /Obama interference with Israeli election? Or is this just a witch hunt?
@ReaganBattalion Trump's entire staff met with Russians...Not normal on any day.
thank you. It shouldn't have taken this level of dishonesty for you to make this statement, but nonetheless thank you.
you're on the right track but stopped short of calling for an independent investigation.
You establishment POC!
good statement.  Is there also the issue of the standards for truthfulness under oath?
"Putin's oligarchy of crooks and spooks" Good choice of words. 
Good job Senator. Perception unfortunately is reality in DC.
@mindyfinn Sasse-y!
@mindyfinn
If necessary, when the time comes, pls defect (temporarily) to I (Independent) to ensure that impeachment of @POTUS is possible
@james_ka_smith as christians we better find a better place than Repub or dem or we will be the prob not solution
What do liberals want?  More!  Good luck appeasing them.
Thank you.
woulda been kinda nice to know this before people voted for the guy, eh?
@weRtroydavis @SenSasse If the nominee hadn't lied during rushed confirmation hearings, we would have...
Thank you Sen..
Bill Clinton was de-barred for perjury, and much less serious issues.   Do you guys want Sessions deputy to take over Russian inv.
The lies continue to snowball. Please, get to the bottom of this administration's saga of dishonesty!
WH lied about Flynn/Kushner contact  with Russians. https://twitter.com/pgourevitch/status/837418128325869568 …
It's about time u stood up to the Democrat's.BACK SESSIONS!
what in god's name are you talking about?? He's greenlighted every one of trump's cabiney picks so far
Well done.  Now please support an independent commission.  It's clearly warranted.
WHEN will congress stand for integrity? U will never get approval ratings up until common sense&integrity return. Crooks&liars!
Well said. However, we the American people demand Benghazi level investigations.
from 0 to Democrat lap poodle in 3.6 seconds. Sit Jeff, stay, lay down..Good boy...
Sessions lied to congress. Must resign. #SessionsMustResign
He should resign, not just recuse himself.
I am a big Sasse supporter, but I am disappointed in the lack of support for Sessions.  Time to stand up to obstructionist dems
You think Sessions needs support for lying?

so is Obamacare repealed yet?
Recusal is not enough. This is why we don't trust ANY of you. Time for an entire new  house....2018!
Amen! Too many career politicians out of touch with the realities of american life. Time to actually drain the swamp
