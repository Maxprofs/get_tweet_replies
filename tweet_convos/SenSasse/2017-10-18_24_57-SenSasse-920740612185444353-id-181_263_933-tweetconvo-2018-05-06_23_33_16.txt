Primary this clown. GOP Sen. Ben Sasse Blasts Roy Moore, Condemns ‘White Backlash Grievance’ on the Right
TRUTH hurts huh???  #Guilt

Republicans say they don't want to hurt Medicare. Then why does their budget cut Medicare by hundreds of billions of dollars? 
Congress is not doing enough to prevent the Trump administration from turning the United States into an authoritarian nation. #Gaslighting

Eric Schmidt's offer to create and sell dossiers on every Google user for the benefit of a political campaign must not be ignored, please.
Well @RT_com is a bit slow on the uptake on the Google/DNC connection, but whatever. #QAnon.
Commercial? What about election hacking? What about collision?
the Clinton Russia uranium collusion? Oh it's true it's damn true.

@SenSasse @SenatorFischer @RepDonBacon 
Anyone in Nebraska get to bid on this? https://twitter.com/NPR/status/922942800252907520 …

I have a great idea. Dont change a thing about the system that allows  americans to bribe congress on behalf of foreign govts!!!
Congress has forgotten their place They ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS we have given jobs to. STOP the WARS & FALSE FLAGS. VOTE INCUMBENTS OUT in 2018
You lament endless growth of unchecked executive branch powers. 

Will you therefore support @ChrisMurphyCT’s bill?
Senator follow the courage of Sen Flake! Have the courage to speak up to Trump.  Stop being silent in the face of the decline of civility!
Wish U had the guts of Canadian @ItsRyanClayton

@AmericansAction doing something while U drink @drpepper @BenSasse
Video: Protester posing as journalist throws papers at Trump as he arrives for Senate GOP lunch yelling "Trump is treason!" 
Please press Sessions & Co on what they ARE doing to protect us from Russia - when his boss still says its all fake news!!!
I think we need protection from the uranium the Clintons and Obama administration sold to the Russians. Get informed
How did the vanishing adult Senator from Nebraska vote on Sessions confirmation?
What did the vanishing adult Senator from Nebraska say about the AG with amnesia?
Ben Sasse is a jerk STOP CALLING AMERICANS WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP RACISTS. Sick of it. Nothing to do with race. JOBS, NT’L SECURITY, CORRUPTION

You attack the President while protecting the real criminals. You will see the hand of God continue to move and expose corruption.
Hearing was a joke Repubs spent more time on Clinton emails then

“We are $20 trillion in debt and the GOP solution is to Make Tax Cuts For The Rich Great Again!” is a good message for Dems in 2018. https://twitter.com/althomelandsec/status/923667914799988737 …

New congressional analysis finds Senate tax bill would add $1 trillion to the budget deficit, rather than the $1.4 trillion earlier estimate. http://apne.ws/GpyIIG7 
Jeff Sessions seems oddly excited by "commercial penetration"

Could someone translate “Fuck the Poor” into Latin so we can replace “in pluribus unum”? 
Because it’s gettin to be a theme these days. https://twitter.com/ap/status/923009327270576128 …
That's because you are yellow bellied clown! Clinton has been doing more with Russia, than Trump ever had. Cant wait to primary you.

How many more decisions like this will we stand for before it means all out war against those paying for policy? Our own wealthy are enemies
Bye Bye Azz-HULE  have a nice life outside congress #loser
Didn’t stand for Flake speech but you’ll give us a brilliant quote on bravery, right?  Coward.

 
THIS is substance which u ignored!
@Potus @seanhannity @Lou Dobbs  Where are you hiding Ben? Come out come out wherever you are! Hannity exposed you tonight #nevertrumper

But some economists say the White House's math rests upon a shaky foundation. http://n.pr/2yJ2GZK 
Nice Ben - Now I know why your friends with Bill Maher
Todd Starnes: Never Trump mob led by Ben Sasse attacks Trump spiritual adviser http://fxn.ws/2yKCaAP 
Watched your exchange with AG Sessions, so much confusion between info ops, election integrity, & cyber. Info Ops & Cyber are not the same!
Great question on Info Ops preparedness, but the answer given was about IP theft and DoD cyber defense capabilities. Apples and oranges!
Info Ops is partially about understanding behavioral analytics, micro-targeting, and requires traceability of social media content & ads.

If u refuse to believe Dems who say this tax bill will destroy middle class, how ab Bloomberg?  He’s REP & says is BAD unless u make $900k+.
You put him on the spot!  Now could you please stop @realdonaldtrump from killing @billbrowder?  Trump revoked his visa.  Putin can get him!
If Sessions isn’t able to fully grasp the complexity he should move aside and let someone who does understand take over
Great questions for Sessions! Obvious DOJ not even thinking about future Russian interference in our elections-what can be done about that?
