Ben, you need to fix the #ACA, not repeal it. And stop calling it "Obamacare", you need to say "Affordable Care Act" in your statements. 1/
To do otherwise is to potentially mislead your constituents, who may not be aware they are the same thing. You must know that there was 2/
deliberate deception about this. 3/e
The Obama admin deliberately asked networks to call it OCare b/c they thought the power of his personality helped it. Can't have both ways.
I don't want it both ways: for that reason as well as mine, I would prefer that *everyone* call it the Affordable Care Act. Let's debate 1/
the merits/demerits of the act itself, rather than debating the man associated with it. 2/e
URAMORON LIKE TRUMP. Moving Jobs is not why Ins Premiums and RX bills are rising. GREED is the reason why medical costs are rising.
Main reason we gave GOP all 3 branches of Govt over the last 7 yrs is due to the promise of #Fullrepeal. Not a replacement or amendment!!!
Just saying..careful what u wish 4. And....honestly.... gl w/ those babies.
standing promise bc some are cowards and others are progressives like the Dems.
That's sad..sorry u went thru that & still r!  I just think we should have protections from insurers. Gov't shouldn't run healthcare.
On this I absolutely agree!!!
I think govt should negotiate 4 better pricing 4 all, hospitals still private, doctors their own boss but we need protection from "free" mkt
Nah I want govt out completely! Competition and transferability will give us lower prices. They can go after Big Pharma to help lower costs
Pre-ACA? Ur kids will never have covrg.Never w/o ins but stuck w/$18k surg bc claimed pre-ex.Lawyers wouldn't help, state either. Need regs
BTW I AM A REPUBLICAN IN NV AND I AM TELLING HELLER PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. I AM WATCHING CSPAN NOT CNN. U MAKE ME SICK
U, Trump, and McConnel stand for GREED. #SHOWTHATGREEDISTHEPROBLEMWITHEVERYTHING
You people work for us not the other way around. 83% of America don't want statues removed. Your to scared of blacks hiding behind racism!
You've had 7 years to come up with a replacement.  How much more time do you think you need?
Right & it's Trump's promises that the American people want Sasse.... definitely not yours!
How do you plan on doing that without filling the your pockets and the rest of your crony buddies.?
Just a thought, are you up for re-election in 2018?
Let's hope so.
So no bill that causes people to lose their health insurance, right? That how I read you? I live in Nebraska too, Ben, and I say NO Repeal.
and he's eyeing the WH. Over. my. Dead. Body. U R no patriot, ben
Just want to reiterate how happy we all are you're voting blindly for a bill no one has read or understands. Give 'em hell, Senator!
U probably won't get as big of a Koch check next month but thank God that insane amendment failed.
#Nebraska voters got what they voted for:Medicaid cuts from state & federal government+addl entitlement cuts from @RepDonBacon for military.
Very disappointed in how you voted yesterday. Healthcare for Nebraskans is major issue for Nebraska voters and we won't forget
You care nothing about your constituents. You represent yourself and not us. I will work tirelessly to make sure you're a 1 term senator!!!
Disappointed in NE representation. When will you finally listen to your constituents? Show us the call logs. Your care should be taken away.
Except you & your Republican cronies have no plan, your repeal slogan is nothing more than political retribution
The motion you voted on today for a bill that does none of these things. You are a liar.
I can't wait to not vote for you in 2018.
Yes.
I think people like McCain, Sasse, Flake believe (many) right things. I know they say the right things. But they don't do the right things.
Another cowardly day from the man who's referred to as "the Cowardly Lion of the Senate"  #Boo #Hiss
So you went and voted YES to BCRA today. You are a terrible representative
Too bad the bill the Senate has proposed neither drives down the cost OR protect the most vulnerable. Why did you vote for this to proceed??
Is it true that DJT can appoint anyone  previously confirmed for a different post & they can remain as AG until 2019. No add'l confirmation?
Shame on you for your vote today!!!!!!
HAVE YOU READ THE REVISED H/C BILL?  Answer your constituents please.  I want to know if you'll give a yes to something you haven't read.
Helllo Senator Sasse,
I'm from Norfolk NE and I urge you to vote against repeal and replace of the ACA in the senate vote today.
Such bull!Honey stop running for POTUS for 3damn http://minutes.Vote  No today! ACA needs to stay,GOP WANTS30 million dead.DO AS NE WANTS
We voted you spineless worms in for repeal NO REPLACE!
Nothing less than #FullRepeal #RootAndBranch.
Vote no on aca repeal! Don't blindly follow an   #countrybeforeparty
Vote no on aca repeal! Work on fixing aca! Don't let millions of people lose their healthcare. #historyhasitseyesonyou

Vote NO MTP.  ACA can b fixed w/bipart participation. Pre-ex cond shouldn't destroy people's financial security like b4 ACA.Ppl over party!
Nor much talk of healthcare recently. There is NO way to justify voting 4 ANY bill when neither you nor your constituents know what's in it

I have covered every health bill in Congress since 1986. There has NEVER been anything this nuts before in terms of process. Never. https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/889591081884635136 …
Kushner lied on his forms. Y is law not being followed w/fines/prison?  Y does he still have security clearance?  This admin is bad for U.S.
vote NO this week on the plan to do a straight repeal of ACA. A repeal without quality replacement is ascinine
and vote NO this week on the plan to do a straight repeal of ACA. A repeal without quality replacement is ascinine
Vote NO on BCRA this week
I think the #ACA was a compromise bill between single payer advocates & Insurance advocates. #GOP can't get their factions together. Vote NO
What more does this administration need 2 do b4 congress says enuf?!  Nixon is rolling over in his grave saying 'seriously?'
Please vote no on Health Care Bill.
Putin and Trump are back working on cyber security together.
Administration thinks they r rulers. Ur PUBLIC SERVANTS. Listen to us. Medicare4All is only solution.
Trump thinks infomercials w/$12-15 p/mo life insurance is what we pay 4 healthcare. Live on <$100k p/yr w/$13k p/yr 4 fam of 3 w/$6k deduc
For the love of God, please educate this man! He thinks adults ages 21-70 pay $12 a year for insurance!?!?
#MakeMuellerNotFireableByTrump
Please do not give into Trump pressure on ACA. Fix it where needed; don't repeal it. All Trump cares about is HIM being seen as a "winner."
If elected reps voted according to constituent sentiment we wdnt be worrying about 2 votes. It shudnt have even been close.no representation
Anxious to hear your ideas for path forward on healthcare legislation.
Don't recall promise to let internet usage be monitored, manipulated & sold. Guess that's what GOP calls "working for the people" these days
I wonder if @BenSasse wants to repeal ACA so the Koch Brothers can have a huge tax cut? Think about the ppl Ben not the money u will make.
Why did you write a parenting book instead of a healthcare bill? #adulting
Drudge Front Page 
Oh yeah. It's because "culture is upstream from politics." A great case for @BenSasse to become a sociologist / talk show host / blogger !
Ok, now pass anything on HEALTHCARE. Do your real job.

Are you voting for or against BCRA? Make an official statement on where you stand coward
Please oppose RINOCare.   We know they won't put in the Cruz Amendment.  Mitch's a snake.  #NoDealFullRepeal
Now that Trumpcare is dead, you can be brave and say you never supported that awful bill anyway! 
Add @SenatorFischer too. 
Want to pass a bill and keep your promise? TWO WORDS:  SINGLE PAYER.
If you feel this way, then better work w/ ENTIRE CONGRESS to forge a bill, NOT shove a hated bill written by ins. co.'s down our throats.
It's not about YOU and your fellow senators, Sasse or your "promises" about repealing anything. It's ABOUT ALL AMERICANS having healthcare.
Please stand w SenCollins, so that a bipartisan bill will be worked on,
&even our neediest can have care.
Ppl I know cannot work wo medicaid
#No Trumpcare! #REPEALObamacare completely as PROMISED! #UnitedforFreedom!
U & Fischer voted YES 2 monitor r internet activities 4 others' financial gain. How about legislating 4 ppl, not corporations?
You ran on repealing the ACA, yet you are supporting the Republican HCB which does not repeal. You are a big disappointment.
After seeing u on Real Time I had hope in some GOP members. Then I saw your voting record. 
#FullRepealaspromised
#StandWithRand 
#UnitedForFreedom
Everything social about this senator is automated.
Full repeal
Vote no.  Don't tow party line. 95% of time.
@BenSasse Sen Sasse please vote against trumpcare. When govt gets involved in anything it is ruined. You all promised 2 REPEAL. #fullrepeal
Appreciate your tenacity in working to repeal/replace ACA. Understand logic of Cruz proposal but don't like ins "mkt stabilization" bailout.
You KNOW the BHRA bill is garbage but yet you won't stand up and fight it. Practice what you preach, or step down.
Please stand for full repeal Senator. Your legacy depends on it. Our future rests on it
@GOP=gov't of Putin. Save our Democracy and put country before party or confess and resign as treasonous traitors. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
2nd request..will Congress exempt themselves from Trumpcare limitations?  Reports r conflicting. Serious inquiry.
Please vote NO on the BCRA. It is no better than Obamacare. We want what you promised - FULL REPEAL, then FREE MARKET SOLUTIONS!
BCRA doesn't offer the ONLY real solution - FREE MARKET! #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
You are useless on the very issue you ran on. Great parenting book though.
Wow: watch Susan Collins absolutely rebuke Trumpcare, and admonish GOP colleagues for not holding a single hearing. 
If adding the amendment is the best we can do, PLEASE make sure the full amend is included in the bill and stays there. #UnitedForFreedom
Stand your ground! We The People will not accept anything less than what was promised! #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
Immoral Bill. Elderly and others in greatest need deprived. Junk insurance will result in HIGH premiums for preexisting conditions. Shame!
Dear @SenSasse, are you really going to vote to take away my health insurance?
Thank you for fightin & tryin to do what best for us & our country.Its very much appreciated!!God bless you! #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom

Cruz/Lee amendment was the ONLY tolerable aspect of BCRA. Without it, just Ocare II. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Americans let DC know, loud and clear: #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom #NoSocializedHealthcare
Hatch will retire w/6 fig pension. Congress should have 2 pay 4 their retirement like the rest of us. Would help w/fiscal probs too.
Please stand up for US to #keepyourpromise with a #Fullrepeal!!
Stand strong!  No surrender.  Full repeal. #FullRepeal  #UnitedForFreedom! Nothing less is acceptable. You do NOT compromise  on principle.
#FullRepeal waspromised to the people keep your promises

Get 2 work & get that #FullRepeal! USA isn't meant 4 Marxism! Address price gouging & abuse of the system. Common sense! #UnitedForFreedom!
@SenSasse please keep hard working single moms who depend on Medicade for their kids on your mind when you vote. they depend on it and you.
Ben, #FULLREPEALONLY as PROMISED! NO compromise leading to more socialism! Hold the line! #UnitedforFreedom!
We, the People were promised #FullRepeal! #KeepYourPromise #CongressDoYourJob Get the gov't. out of healthcare!#UnitedForFreedom
#UnitedForFreedom #FullRepeal #KeepYourPromise - return healthcare to the free market!
Dissent is what America is all about. Standing for what's right in the face of all opposition is our heritage. Stand true. #FullRepeal. #UFF
Stand on that promise Senator.  Those who will blame or shame you have already surrendered their honor!  America needs a #FullRepeal of ACA!
#NoMoreFreebies to the Ablebodied! We're broke! #REPEALObamacare completely! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
STOP the insanity Ben! #REPEALObamacare completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
Please fight against socialism and for the liberty of future generations. Fight for #FullRepeal!
#FullRepeal. Vote NO. McConnell and the RINOs are going to pull another fast one and mandate socialism. Please. Vote NO.#UnitedForFreedom.
Surely you don't see the current bill with its Medicaid cuts as protecting our poorest and weakest. Certainly pray you are a NO.
Hey,@SenSasse, would a responsible adult vote for a law that specifically exempts he & his colleagues? NO WAY, right?
vote NO on motion to proceed with Senate consideration of revised BCRA


It's obvious the ACA is better than this AHCA pretends to be. Vote for people, vote NO on this bill.
What is your position on the current Senate Bill? Do you think it will protect the poorest and weakest among us? How will you vote?
Why are you voting for Trumpcare?
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.

Great job with the "fact-checking" there, guy.  Do you measure your IQ in potatoes?  Just curious.
TOTALLY #REPEALOBAMACARE Ben! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom! Keep YOUR PROMISE!
Every healthy person pays for their and their families' healthcare! Personal responsibility! #UnitedforFreedom!
I'm with you, man. So why aren't y'all starting with a bold plan like Wyden-Bennett instead of this? CC: @RonWyden @JohnCornyn
Totally like you, but the Health Care Changes you are supporting hurt Your Constituents
Instead of hawking your book or stripping healthcare from needy Americans, how about the Russian/Trump stuff? #CollusionorTreason #ShowUCare
Thank you for getting  the people's  needs  done and  after  u do that - have a great summer !!!
I am sickened by the fact that would continue to support this bill purely on a partisan basis. This bill will *literally* kill people.
The revised Better Care Reconciliation Act put forth by Senator Ted Cruz is still worthless. Vote against it or I will vote against you
@BenSasse Senator, this is not the right approach.  Repealing with no replacement is a political gamble.  It's really a stunt.  No support.
It's time for a bipartisan approach. This closed door, ramming something through approach is ridiculous!
Not a single official tweet on the Trump - Russia issue. The silence is deafening. #NotAProfileinCourage #PartyOverCountry
.@SenSasse The AHCA won't do it. Back to the drawing board! #Trumpland

What has America come to when GOP lawmakers see nothing wrong in meeting w/ Kremlin emissaries promising interference in our politics?
Ur such a horrible excuse for a @GOP republican. I can't wait for you to be replaced. Rino traitor & it's very obvious. Btw learn the law.
ditto on that! Unreal he doesn't know the constitution after listening to his idiocy today.
Protect the poorest/weakest? MealsOnWheels funding slashed for seniors, and IA Rep King thinks poor people need to get off SNAP & go diet.

Would love to think that statement true. I doubt it without single payer at this point.
Only 17% of Americans want to repeal ACA! People are terrified as well they should be.  When will you stand up and do what's right?  Ever?
The break doesn't need postponed it needs cancelled, Obama care doesn't need replace it needs repealed. No socialist healthcare
If you think freedom is relying on government for healthcare you are mistaken. Give me a better economy where we can buy our own insurance.
Is @realDonaldTrump a perpetual adolescent?  I will keep tweeting at you until I get a response :)
I have no faith that the @GOP will "protect the poorest and weakest among us" if ACA is repealed w/o immediate replacement or fix. #7years
Lol boots with heels ???
For 7 years, Republicans in congress promised they would repeal Obamacare, without ever asking if that is what their constituents want.
Goofy questions today !!  Sharing conspiracy pills with @LindseyGrahamSC ?
so how about you work with @POTUS instead of doing everything u can 2 obstruct and defeat him.  Do you like being the new @SenJohnMcCain ?
Why were you so rude to @JackPosobiec ? He is nice guy. All he did was say hello. Are Republicans having a breakdown?
Then deal with the illness not the symptoms - go after big pharma & bloated insurance companies to bring health costs down.
Lol senator Sasse! Triggered much?
The Intel agencies report on Russia is not irrefutable they can put fingerprints of others on hacks and Obama politicized them
Good questions
