I'm an atheist in Nebraska, do I get rights? Are you going to tell me I'm misguided but god loves me? @NebraskaAtheist @g1rad
Yes, you have rights, if you want to see a place that Atheists don't have rights it's called Saudi Arabia, you're termed terrorists there.
3| Im regularly pitied because people think Im misguided in my fact based beliefs and my Senator is encouraging it @Noah_Lugeons
Facts are not synonymous with the belief Atheism, neither do you become more intelligent from being an Atheist compared to other beliefs
I never said they were. I reviewed the facts and I see no evidence for god. At what point did I say I was more intelligent?
And your post can be taken as an indirect implication that Atheism =/= Intelligence the way you phrased that sentence.
You may want to state what you mean by atheist != intelligence because either your not making sense or your tweets are out of order
But at least I do have the memory to remember the order of what my comments was replying to and what they were not replying to.
Proof please?????
You're one of our weaknesses

Are you talking about Congress? Never seen so many people get rich on your salaries?
I'm going all in with you Senator Basse, I'm a Bos/Dem soon to be a new Ind.I think. A democracy needs balanced government so I'm  in with U
#russsophobia There is this underlying assumption that Russia is the enemy. Are you sure this is a true narrative?
Like our weak, incompetent #POTUS? #Trump lies #TraitorTrump #theworst
Andrei Sivak could lose his life if Russian Supreme Court orders ban on Jehovah's Witnesses on Wednesday 12 April 2017 in Moscow
, is Jehovah’s Witnesses,a denomination committed to belief that the Bible be taken literally,its injunction “Thou shalt not kill.”
& other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence
  The only group the 43-year-old father of three has ever belonged to
His name had popped up on the exchange bureau’s computer system, along with those of members of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State,
when he tried to change some money and the teller “suddenly looked up at me with a face full of fear.”
A dedicated pacifist who has never even held a gun, Andrei Sivak discovered that his government considered him a dangerous extremist,
And also put one of Putins Supreme Court nominees in the bench. The @Gop is fucking America. Looks like some GOP senators better except god
Kind of like Mexico does with our "border."
Great article, BTW
stupid chipmonk. Get braces on those nut huller bicuspids. Next , threesome with mrs.lindsay mccain and mr. Gy mccai
Such as the extremely weak and ineffective @realDonaldTrump ?
Need to start with independent bipartisan investigation of Russian influence on campaign and in WH. Get Russia out.  Foresake partisanship
Ok But worthless without ALL leaders denouncing real fake news and promoting fact-based journalism and critical thinking. WSJ, NYT, WaPo,CBS
Wish you wpuld put your time and effort into advancing the Presidents agenda instead of chasing Russian Ghosts.
Like in the White House?
You are a weak man. You are not a statesman. Lindsay Graham without the wrist flip. GO GET A JOB FLAKE.
Only way to strengthen is for the people to have faith....none at the moment...
such as internet privacy! I can't believe @GOP congress allowed this happen. It makes us less safe. Not smart. I am 68845.
Talk is cheap.
We don't have a civilization, we have an economy.

Our civilization died in WWI. Since then; there is tyranny of numbers.
Agreed - right now they are attacking trust in the media and with Trumps help people don't know what to believe.
@BVTNH Finally some one with common sense.
@LouiseMensch Like our stupid electoral system.
This man has one of the key pieces of the evil among us. Putin.The greedy,the gluttonous,the self serving among us are his tools.
@FreddyRoo2

"Where we are already weak".....that wld be @realDonaldTrump, his camp, @DevinNunes & @PRyan

Country first b4 party!
@ReaganBattalion Like the WH and the GOP Congress? Is that what your saying?
@ReaganBattalion remember how Reagan actually stood up against Russia? Now Republicans just bend over.
I thought he showed promise, I was wrong, such a disappointment.
No kidding, Trump is living proof the GOP sold America for an undisclosed sum of Rubles.
amusing in a way as the GOP began this by becoming the party of liars years ago. Fix your party call for independent investigation
@Marengel4 the WH now that is some weakness in our country
@LouiseMensch That would be the White House and Senate
@wendy161966 when will you call for an independent investigation?
: @SenSasse please live up to the words you speak! Where is the action? We need you to act ASAP
@ReaganBattalion you may want to have a talk to Rep. Nunes
.@SenSasse .@LouiseMensch Weaknesses like hyper-partisanship promulgated by incompetence and refusal to actually GOVERN #SenMajLdrNero
@LouiseMensch nice to talk about it, but U never step forward for action when needed by your country. Choose your side of history
@LouiseMensch Then call for an independent investigation!
So you mean our divisiveness? Like partisanship? Like how your party acts in corrupt fashion to protect Trump? Too late for that.
@LouiseMensch so where are the rest of our senators and congress on this? Nowhere. They believe in politics over country. Traitors
@LouiseMensch  Fissures like politicians who are self serving and don't care a bit about country or public service.
@LouiseMensch hmm, as they're doing!
@LouiseMensch like in the Oval office
@LouiseMensch Thank you, Sir. Spoken like a true patriot.
then why don't you call for an independent investigation?  Stop towing the party line and do the right thing!
please put country first!
If NE1  can make them listen u can Thanks 4 standing w/ NATO & us humble citizens aka the electorate #CIVILdisagreement #keyword
@JordanSchachtel In that case we are in a lot of trouble as we are weak in many ways.
Please demand that Rep. Nunes step aside. It is time for a legitimate thorough investigation.  Nunes has no credibility. thx
So basically our weakest link is the Republican Party!
All countries work at the black PR game. We do as well. Russia  has a dislike of Hillary. Trump is incidental to game.
Like our Government? Step it up man!
Thank you for this stellar perspective. A must watch for all.
KUDOS.  Great job.
There can be no trust when the President continues to lie to our country & hide his tax returns. Demand full disclosure NOW!
@JordanSchachtel without @HillaryClinton who are they gonna target?
.@SenSasse @BenSasse Good words, but meaningless without calling for an independent Trump/Russia commission.  Can't restore trust otherwise.
Please, what is the collusion? Well? We are waiting,,,,,,.....
.@SenSasse @BenSasse You don't need this job, but it needs you to put country first and call for an independent commission on Trump/Russia.
.@SenSasse @BenSasse There is SO MUCH smoke around Trump/Russia, you must call for an independent commission to see if there's also fire.
you're mostly correct. And they are exploiting a big, gaping, compromised hole with the current @POTUS.
Thank you for speaking out for the American people and the good Congressmen who share our values. We are watching. We are united.
He said Putin is exploiting the 2 parties, making them focus on each other, not core American values, making Congress weak
Like allowing our ISPs to sell our info to the highest bidder, including other countries? We are so fucked.
Country before Party!
Senator with all due respect Russia is a declining country with economic base the size of Italy. They can boast but that's it!
DC def doesnt need russias help to do that! more nope
like the fact that we won't independently investigate Trump admin ties to Russia?
i agree, we need to impeach trump
Why did you vote to allow internet providers to sell our browsing history?
why??????
And we are weakest in the Whitehouse. Trumpublicans involved in the collusion are now obstructing the investigation.
So, that makes it okay?
#Wolverine
the President?
the White House?
Exactly what I was going to say !  Yes, the WH & Pres & family.
