Wondering if you can tell me why you’re okay moving forward with hearings on Gorsuch when you wouldn’t have hearings for Garland.
that's how the system works. No nominee is guaranteed a hearing, especially w/less than a year to go in presidency.
seems obvious at this point that the Orange Cretin will be out in less than a year. Stop Gorsuch!
even if he is his replacement has already endorsed Gorsuch.
Trump illegitimate, therefore Pence too. Probably need new election. 8 justices ok until then.
based on what law would such a scenario actually play out?
I don't think there's law regarding election being won through treasonous actions. Interesting times!
I am watching, and I am Nebraskan, I understand what a big deal these hearings are, why do you seem not too?
Are you objecting to his humor? It was incredibly helpful to tense & hostile hearings & I'm sure appreciated by Gorsuch.
several time, Sasse said, no one is watching and Nebraskans don't care. And asking Gorsuch so many questions is a waste of time
Nebraskan's don't care needs context; he said they don't care about what?
The reason it was a waste to ask so many questions is because the questions were entirely inappropriate or redundant.
Once Sasse said how much we all need a lesson in civics but most people were not watching, so it was a regret.
Ben Sasse is especially gifted in saying hard things in a gentle way; I was glad he spoke up & others said similar things.
There were also other efforts at humor but Ben's were the best & the only one's to get belly laughter WHICH WAS NEEDED!
@ReformedBroker Here's another side of Sasse. Hoping to buy him a beer soon to discuss cancer research. #bigdreamer
How modest of you but you and Gorsuch are cut from the same cloth. Covering up and deflecting with folksy humor doesn't cut it.
.@SenSasse you rock! I hope to meet you one day. Keep up the great work! #PenceSasse2020
@tshep42 He was nominated by someone who colluded with a foreign power to get elected and then use the presidency to make money.
I didn't know politics could be funny.
thanks for the smile :)
it's funny because the President uses made up words! LOL  #doyourjob
such handsome bullshitters.
are you seriously my Senator? Or an annoying class clown middle school boy who tries to make jokes to gain popularity?
@tshep42 He is a so-called judge who is willing to accept a stolen seat. #resist #NOTNORMAL
I think you should wait till the next president selects his nominee 
So you think @mike_pence will make good choices in 8 years? I agree but no need to wait.
much better question than Kamala Harris asking CIA director about AGW.
Gross. Your credibility falters when you use the phrase "won bigly." Lie down with the dogs (DJT & pals), wake up with fleas.
Classic! Nice job!
= Grandstander. Self-promoter.  Stunning hubris. Sad #GorsuchHearing
Yeah, it was super cute. Now vote NO on confirmation. #NoProbeNoRobe
AMAZING!!
unlike a clean repeal we've been promised I do hope you get this man confirmed Ryan care don't work for me
Couldn't have rehearsed that better, eh? You nitwits are a complete and utter sham. Sad.
Ha! Good one!
@AngieManning7 
Glad to see some humor on Capitol Hill
Thank you Senator for conducting your questioning of the Judge in a respectful manner. Unlike Stewart Smalley did.
You're funny, now get ready to tell the Fascist Trump, to take his tRumpcare bill, and move to Russia &, Make America Great Again
@BruceAshford this is great!
@BenSasse you absolutely made the hearing worth watching #Bigly #GorsuchHearing
hahahaha oh my gosh subverting the constitution for a year is sooooo funny!
I've always thought @realDonaldTrump was saying "big league" not "bigly". Could we get a clarification on this? #criticalinfo
@BenSasse Loved this!! Even made the Fallon show!
@BenSasse still laughing! Nicely done!  
fantastic exchange! I will forever like you.
you look positively enamored in this vid. Fawning bigly.
a bigly winner is what we need
Except that he shouldn't have been nominated because there should not have been a vacancy. #GOPobstruction.
John Hancock.... More like Herbie Hancock.
like a boss!
that was pretty good.
Bigly!
Your nephew's the one paying me $5. 
You have great timing..Perhaps someday when u have a minute, U could give @govmikehuckabee some pointers.
@LisaMarieBoothe Smart Sen. Ben.
Absolutely hillarious exchange. A rare thing on Capital Hill. @gagetaylor
Huuuge!
Just saw your question played on Trevor Noah, you embarrassed Nebraska
seems like a genuinely nice guy. He's also a huge hypocrite.
......
Good to see not all politicans have the personality of fly paper and can actually laugh.
My FAV tweet of the day! Ty for sharing!
This is awesome! I missed it. Ty so much for sharing. Priceless!!!!!
love your sense of humor!
Did you know Sasse was #NeverTrump?
@BenSasse that was awesome!
great American humor!  thank you, sir.
@LisaMarieBoothe he deserves a medal
@LisaMarieBoothe Laughed so hard when I saw this.  Mr Gorsuch had a great week.
@LisaMarieBoothe Be wonderful if the entire hearing was this friendly and respectful!
@LisaMarieBoothe Re: Gorsuch hearing is taking 4-days. I would like to think the tax payers are getting something out of this?
@LisaMarieBoothe for cryin out loud It IS BIG LEAGUE
Hilarious 
are you starting to drink Trumpian Kool-Aid?  Bigly?
That was GOOD!  
@JosephIrato the dumbing down of America all the way to the Supreme Court nominee.  What have you done @GOP
the democrats voting block is highly intelligent.
@calebecarma If you ever get bored as a Senator from Nebraska, we would love to have you as one in PA. Oh, and Neb. Will beat Iowa
Bigly?  Seriously, Republicans primary this fool.
This is why you're one of the best Senators in American history 
"Do you like puppies and sunshine and rainbows as much as me?" #softball #weak #293days #shameful
Mr. Sasse:  You are embarassing yourself and Nebraska
Can you please teach the rest of Congress about sense of humor and not taking yourself too seriously?
@beck_ann4
How about some questions of policy with substance? It seems like you're just trying to sound clever and get laughs. #DoYourJob
Loved all the questions you have presented thus far - you are in tune with what's important let's #confirmgorsuch
win
Consent by jocularity?  Ask a substantive question! @SenSasse
Ben doesn't ask substantive questions of Republicans, he just fawns over them in the hope they will reciprocate.
two days in a row you were able to show respect and also bring humor to the room to help Judge Gorsuch relax. Great example.
THAT'S funny !  Nice to see the human side of people.  Some in Washington really have a cob up their....
@BenSasse You're the GOAT 
YUGE win Senator
Yes!!!!!!!!!  Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ba dum dum de dum
Nice clean up of & after #StuartSmalley. What hateful, small man. Wish you were my Senator.
I was listening live and had to stop and look at screen when i heard it then the Sen. said "You said bigly" Me:
@BenSasse Asked my 13yo son why a signature is referred to as John Hancock and he answered because he signed so #bigly #ironic
@BenSasse I still don't agree with most of your positions but this made me laugh.
so he was given the courtesy of a hearing? That sounds nice.
this Californian thinks you're a national treasure!
@BenSasse Ben Sasse is my favorite person I am LOVING THIS
nice comic relif but answer is wrong to say "no one remembers who he was! Thats @bigly wrong. funny exchange
We'll never know how Merrick Garland would've answered these questions because you refused to meet or give him hearing.
Uh oh, watch out Senator, the fun police are rushing to this thread!

Maybe the only high point of the day.
you sir are a savage and the only hope for the future of the GOP.   Please take the helm in four years.
@BenSasse I simply CANNOT hate you. It's infuriating! 
It's easy if you look at his voting record.
I find using Trump speech pathetic. Do you lie every 5 minutes like he does too? #NoGorsuch
Don't be so sour. I'm totally anti-Trump (but pro-Gorsuch), but you're missing the humor because of your discontent.
Sir , watched that exchange on C-Span , ( obviously I need a life ,lol) your a breath of fresh air , you give us hope 
@BenSasse 
Do not confirm until this Russia investigation is over.
I love your Humor Senator Sasse !!!
Best part is @SenSasse's attention to comedic tone and timing on both "five bucks" cc:@jonlovett
On your way to rock stardom!
The answer was perfect given this WH isn't known for being intellectual, just for grabbing the mood of the country!
Appreciate your efforts to demonstrate how a knowledge of our history & civics is bigly relevant in those we choose to govern us.
hilarious, Gorsuch is great! @realDonaldTrump on the other hand should be impeached as does most of his cabinet over Russia.
At least there are some sane people left. Thank you.
cool!
So theft counts as winning to you? Who taught you ethics, Donald Trump? #StolenSeat
The signers of the Declaration didn't steal anything. @paulfesta @SenSasse
That was most worthless question & answer I can imagine. It tells nothing about him or his qualifications to sit on highest court.
You're biased against Trump supporters, so what do you care? Clearly you merely want an answer you can complain about.
you continue to be the best
NOT HIS SEAT. IT SHOULD BE GARLAND! #yourdaysarenumbered #sad #voteno
you're making YUGE assumption that Garland would have made it out of committee.
HAHAHA WE STOLE A SCOTUS SEAT.
@byrdinator you had me at #bigly
Also, this isn’t a fucking joke. You’re interviewing an SC nominee put forth by a president that may have colluded with Russia.
You are the man @SenSasse keep bluring the party lines
@byrdinator wow. Amazingly tough question that helps to vet a candidate and understand his thinking. How do you do it?
The humor was tremendously helpful to long, tense, sometimes hostile hearings.
Quick responses provided huge comic relief. Hugely.
1st time i've seen a response from sasse that i liked ...gives me hope
Did you ever get him to actually answer the question?
You make politics fun! "You just said 'Bigly' and I just won $5..I think my work here is done." #SenatorBenSasse  #ConfirmGorsuch
You trapped him.  Also, for you personally, is it bigly or big league?
did you learn Bigly in your English books at Harvard?  How about Russia?
Awesome exchange... :-)
