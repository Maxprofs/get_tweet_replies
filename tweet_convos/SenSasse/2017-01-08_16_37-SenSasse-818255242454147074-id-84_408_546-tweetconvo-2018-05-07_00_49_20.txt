And how many billions (if not trillions) does govt spend or waste on poor quality "education"? Shame on all who tolerates this.
Total education expenditures, including training programs, constistute less than 3% of the Federal budget.  @SenSasse
Our education spending is WAY out of control & we get a very mediocre product. I'll fight this. https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/253977/ …
Bullshit article. In 1975, education was 3.8% of Fed budget. Now down to 3%.Check source data yrself, don't trust partisans.
Honestly IDGAF if spending is local, state or fed. It's too high.

And anyway 3% of our vastly oversize Fed budget is enormous.
Honestly, you can't judge whether it is too high or too low when you don't even GAF what it actually is or does.
Governing a nation is complicated. Here, educate yourself about the current education budget: https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/president-obamas-2017-budget-seeks-expand-educational-opportunity-all-students …
Heh - you're putting much effort into speaking to an internet nobody. I'm honored! Here's my citation.
Our government schools are the problem.
"Conservative" pressure from the Right eliminated civics education as a requirement in all but three States. @SenSasse
@bleumoon @kleegrubaugh @SenSasse 

That's nuts. Maybe ur revisionist civics. I home schooled my because of public ed nonsense.
Well, that explains everything. @bleumoon @kleegrubaugh @SenSasse
On a brighter note, a whole bunch of Americans know the second clause of the Second Amendment by heart.
evidently education should be a priority if not we get white guys in suits without any critical thinking skills
@MattMackowiak 

Trump believes there are 12 articles in the US Constitution
let's see the sample size and who was polled What the hell does a "recent survey" indicate other than just talking points
>@SenSasse @MeosoFunny In a Longitudinal Study of People Born after 1991, only 17.8193826% could Name All Four Beatles.
Since education became a federal bureaucracy
That survey must have been of only Trump supporters.
If this is a priority of yours, please explain this 
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/media/journalists-arrested-trump-inauguration.html …
@MeosoFunny I believe it.
@auburn_mike That's because the Democrats took it out of the schools.
We have a President who doesn't know the 1st Amendment. Who threatens religion and the press. Please stand up.
It's not bad schools, it's bad parenting. People expecting gov to raise their kids for them b/c they can't be bothered
@jarkesy MLK was the single most important figure in American history who made REAL change, not Lewis who just pooped in his nest.
not surprising; ignorance explains why trump was voted. We need 2 educate our principles & more
57% just happens to be the percentage of white Americans. Thanks for pointing out that blacks and hispanics lack basic civic knowledge.
Ben hopefully that includes freedom of the press which Trump and the GOP seem to have forgotten.
Libs in general, & HRC in particular, want an "uninformed" and "compliant" citizenry. Civics will be taught again under DJT! 
can we also talk about the establishment clause? ya know, not just the free exercise.
@MattMackowiak
@blackrepublican Something Education Sec should rectify
People see no reason to teach the 1st Amendment when the GOP plans to get rid of it anyhow.
I call bullshit.
And that's why such a large minority voted for Trump, who attacks press freedoms, freedom to criticize him, & freedom of religion
Seriously Senator, don't you think Civics should be a Senior level course with a test before graduation? We are paying for the ed.
Well, you hate and oppose all five, so I guess you should be happy with that. How's Hitler Pol Pot Sessions going to protect me?
this is how the GOP wins elections, bud. Ignorance, hate, and bigotry. Oh, and Russian interference, of course.
and none of that 57% voted for Trump.
Agreed!  Social studies & civics being taught by coaches which is more important in Nebraska than quality teaching.
Blaming Obama you not only bear false witness, you repeat the ignorance given Obama has used fewer executive orders than most.
U can send that thanks to the public school system who has us listed 23 in the world Is the goal to 49 or 50 in the future?
Go pick corn. Why didn't the judge set the bail higher for the driver who killed the woman. Don't blame POTUS. GROW UP.
Education is mess including university.
1.) Freedom of religion and free exercise thereof #1stAmendment
2.) Freedom of speech #1stAmendment
3.) Freedom of the press #1stAmendment
4.) The right of the people peaceably to assemble #1stAmendment
And 5.) the right of the people to petition the Government for a redress of grievances #1stAmendment
That's because the only amendment that seems to matter to them is the Second. Which, no surprise, is also distorted.
That's one more than Trump knows....
If you believe in the First Amendment, why are you censoring http://Backpage.com ?
thank a teacher. If you want our children to know these things ban syllabus teaching & have non union teachers
Thank you fofr who you are and what you stand for Senator. http://grandmathunder.com/2016/06/understanding-the-trump-phenomenon/@SenSasse …
Trump and the GOP want it this way The Simple Minded Uniformed "Keep the Government out of my Medicare" Crowd that vote for them
too many are just hung up on the 2nd, which they don't really know or begin to understand, just that it's GUNS!
Trump can't name them either. He'd fail a citizenship test.
Curious, is this true even in NE (where I grew up)? If so, why? Can't really blame feds for this, can we? What's the disconnect?
UR on short list of those I trust, maybe 2024. VP?  Hoosier/Husker ticket? If not U, Gov Abbot, Sen Cotton. NE 22 cold 4 bvllshit
@MaxBoot SENATOR YOU GET WHAT IS AT STAKE
It's Your Fault! Who Runs The Department of Education @usedgov? YOU Do! The Curriculum? YOU Do! #DELETE Your Twitter Account!
I'm not American or conservative but I kinda love you… The state of civics knowledge is as bad here
Evidence of our excellent public schools and patriotic teachers.
maybe the GOP should stop trying to cut funding for public schools.
@lcpinco Freedom of the press. This is laughable.
@husainhaqqani  A maligned establishment has managed to lead the US & the world despite absent or uninformed voters. What's next?
@realDonaldTrump knows none of them. Maybe we should familiarize him with the 25th Amendment, Section 4 - he is clearly unable ...
You said it!
we need dramatically increased emphasis on history and civics education.
As someone who is a teacher, I blame the k-12 system along with parents. People do not learn this anymore.
Now let's talk about the federalist society's role in blocking @BarackObama SCOTUS pick.
http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/federalist-society-vp-says-senate-could-ignore-scotus-nominees-indefinitely/ …
@ErgoOne I'll bet it's 7% for the Third Amendment...
<chuckle> And probably as few or fewer for the 10th. :/ @SenSasse
@RadioFreeTom Why do they never call me in these surveys? I would fucking CRUSH that question. Man, I never get survey calls... 
@EliotACohen what's the poll? Breitbart?
Congress shall make NO law respecting an establishment of religion. 
We are free from religion and free to practice religion.
@RadioFreeTom We are becoming a "Mediocrity" where average is slowly slowly lowering.  However, I cannot speak to why this occurs.
Freedom of religion
Freedom of the press
Freedom of speech
Right of peaceful assembly & to petition government

December 15, 1791
I appreciate what you're but, why not, also, add the resources to change it:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution …
Do an amendment a day and we can learn together.
But really we should start at the beginning: https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/preamble …
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, and....so much for that
do you or do you not want a Russian spy in the White House?
!
@EliotACohen This is why public education for all is important.
Frightening.
Good speech. Sadly, the First Amendment is currently under relentless attack.
truly most only care about the 2nd amendment especially when told repeatedly someone's coming to get them when no one is
I suspect the results would have been same 50 yrs ago. Diff: we used to have strong polit. parties to keep the Trump types out.
the knowledge and character, at that
Doesnt help that most schools focus on science and math and abandon social studies/history. My town replaced SS with Span. culture
.  half the GOP in America thought Hillary would have the power to repeal the 2nd Amendment, blow a dogwhistle long enough...
this is important. You should repeat this tweet when the Packer game is not on.
