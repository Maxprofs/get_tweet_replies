Yuck 
BE CLEAR.  The nuclear option is YOUR failure.  It is bc YOU've become so partisan and uncompromising.
I'm ashamed that you are my Senator. I'll be voting against you at my first opportunity.
Primary him! He sucks. No matter what side your on
@BenSasse "The team owners who make up Major League Baseball @MLB had spent more than 2 years & more than $1 million lobbying Congress & the @WhiteHouse to exempt themselves from having to pay minor league players minimum wage & overtime." @sharblock

On #OpeningDay, let’s remember that many minor leaguers can’t afford to attend @MLB games. A provision in the tax law allows minor leaguers to be paid $1,160 a month for a 40-hour week - with no overtime pay. @sharblock explains this injustice https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/03/29/minor-league-baseball-donald-trump-budget/463394002/ …
Well, one out of two, anyway. Gorsuch should not be confirmed until the Trump-Russia investigation is completed.
Gorsuch
How dare you say this crap against Our @POTUS   I will say ONE thing about Dems; they stick together no matter whay! Shame ON YOU!
GBR!!
Shame on you. The man avoided questions, he is ultra right And lastly, you FAILED to give the previous candidate a honest consideration.
A good day for dark money you mean?
Yes its more broken now than ever before thief!!!!
Sad day that you support Nuclear Option to get Gorsuch confirmed.
Garland was qualified.  Quit pretending Republicans have any moral high ground.  Admit your failings and try to bring this country together.
Gross and flagrant hypocrisy after the GOP blocked the nomination of Merrick Garland http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-supreme-court-nomination-20170131-story.html … #shameful
It is senators like you that make citizens hate &/ their government!
Considering the Senate changed the strike rule in the 9th w/ a full count & bases loaded to walk Gotsuch in, I'd say it's rather pathetic.
Well lookit that! Mr. "Adult" supported the childish stalling game for a year w/ #Obama, but unprecedented rush-thru of unfit idealogue.
Outraged but mostly ashamed for lack of integrity shown by @SenSasse in choosing #partyovercountry #diminishedsentate #darkmoney #stolenseat
Why does the @Gop want the face of treason represented on the SC? Thats not a good day for America, and GOP hearts might stop beating soon.
Gorsuch is a right wing extremist. If he weren't, those extremist right wing groups wouldn't have spent tens of millions on this.

A seat stolen by you and your party. A shameful day for America when President under FBI investigation for treason is permitted this.
Breaking the Senate is not a good day for America
Vote no on Gorsuch!
#DriveAllNightForNeil
Um does Neil Gorsuch get to keep being on the Court for the next 40 years if it turns out everyone who put him there committed treason?
So @GayleKing, u still promoting this charlatan? Yes, #MSM owners trying to salvage @GOP brand w/ "reasonable" ones, but u don't have to...
Thank you president trump! And not Hillary Clinton who ben sasse voted for!
Biden would've nominated a political hack elena kagan clone.
...it might have been a better day for America if Judge Garland had been treated fairly...but alas, that didn't happen...
Gorsuch is probably qualified despite dodging questions.  He should be given a vote right after Merrick Garland.
#Gorsuch is horrendous. Extreme ideologue. Clearly doesn't follow precedent. 1 of all-time shortest hearings, yet whined 1 day was SOO long
Only 1310 days until the 2020 election. I don't think it's fair that Trump got to choose Gorsuch. We should let the American people decide.
I've never liked you and now I know I am right! You're a TRAITOR! You say this CRAP to NYT? @realDonaldTrump
ANOTHER DEPLORABLE CAN NOT WAIT TILL YOU ARE REPLACED
No more Trump appointees shld be considered for govt office till after full pvt investigation of Trump Admin ties w/Russia & all r cleared.
Huh? You must support Citizen's United, then, huh? Big business over workers. Is that what got you elected? Pay offs?
Gorsuch IS NOT good for the country
Baseball is American. 45 is Russian.  Illegitimate legacy appt by minority pres, torpedo Garland, and you are unAmerican too. Change!
where were you for baseball playoffs and #MerrickGarland vote?
Stop with chummy tweets and go after "unmasking gate" so the American people can have justice.  They committed a crime!
Put away your party loyalty and listen to what some of your COLLEAGUES are saying about Judge Gorsuch. Lifetime appts require tough scrutiny
Senator Sasse:  I very much appreciate the work you are doing in support of our nation.  Thank you.  ~  L
Did the Daily Kos put out a fatwa on your twitter? Sheesh. Confirming Gorsuch despite the democrat temper tantrum is the right thing to do.
And Merrick Garland? What about him?
Of course you approve a right wing extremist. I had higher hopes for you Ben. #ashamed
why do you all lie so much. Gorsuch is the wrong judge for the people of America. Everyone can see that
All of you libs who are butt-hurt over Garland know darn well that the Dems would have done the same thing. Get over it.
If it were up to Anti-Trumpers like you, Crooked Hillary would be packing SCOTUS right now. MAGA @realDonaldTrump! @ChuckGrassley @joniernst
Play the game the way the Dems do.  It's the only way to beat them.
But a terrible day for #women w #sexist #misogynist #backward #JudgeGorsuch & @GOP #WarOnWomen!  #notgoingback #womensrightsarehumanrights!
Yasse, it is.
In South Florida seeing lots of commercials for Gorsuch confirmation.What do the Dark Money folks expect in return? The 0.1% don't waste $$$
Gorsuch says a fetus is not a person. His taking a SCOTUS seat is not good for American babies. 
When you blocked Garland that was the nuclear option, the rest is fall out
PUKE
By my count you don't have the filibuster threshold covered. He is anti people, pro corporations, and just generally mean spirited. Vote no.
Maybe you are figuring out that the dems and media will not let up and our great President needs some allays.  Team up and MAGA!
How do you justify not giving Garland a hearing? I know you love Garland, but you're missing the big picture.
Can you honestly say President Obama in his second term was somehow less legitimate than this embarrassment of a "president" we have now?
#WhatAboutGarland
U and the other GOP's will own this don't forget.  With investigations going on, low ratings, failed health care.  U are making bad decision
Not so much a good day, though, for your constituent's internet privacy.
Why did you refuse to even hold a hearing for Garland? #Obstructionist
2700 OPINIONS!?!? My mother in law, on her best day of judging me and others, does not have 2,700 opinions. Tho' must admit, she comes close
Thank you @SenSasse
Well you're half right.
Completely agree.
@BenSasse Agreed! It would be even better if you turned that 5 o'clock shadow into a full beard. #OpeningDay #DriveForGorsuch
I ask you WJD?
Not a good day for America.  Garland was robbed, and I am shocked by your highly partisan response.
Do not waste the nuclear option on #Gorsuch. @SenateDems will filibuster every nominee, so make it count & give us Judge Bill Pryor instead.
Nice to see that you are willing to get rid of the filibuster on SCOTUS nominees. What comes around goes around.
It could be better...
#NeverTrump
@BenSasse what do you think of going nuclear for Gorsuch?
Senator you can call foul all you want. This is a stolen seat! Nominated by a president that will not serve an entire term.
No Ben.  It is not.
Let us hope we don't have another freedom caucus fiasco like @tedcruz
Garland. Have integrity.
Well, baseball is back anyway
Why so serious?
@senjudiciary guilty until proven guilty - that is exactly what is wrong w/the dems mindset. Its destroying our society #gorsuch
What kind of day is it for Merrick Garland?
Unemployment day.
Would've been a good day a year ago if Merrick Garland had been confirmed.  You people are shameless.
If you're a corporation not if you're a person
Hmm. Mixing baseball with today's version of the GOP produces something more like the Black Sox Scandal.
No, this just takes us one step closer to being even more in the grips of dark money. He evaded those ? U r complicit

GOP kill filibuster during 1-term POTUS, hand over SCOTUS to DEMS next election, with only simple majority to clear for confirmation. Thanks
I respect YOUR choice. I wish you could have respected mine who was Judge Garland. Now YOU are going to vote to Destroy Democracy
Only thing I learned from the hearing today was how awesome @SenSasse is. Nebraska is lucky to have you! #confirmgorsuch
It's a good day for America? Our @POTUS is under investigation and Russia meddled in our election. 1/
A good day for America is when you stand up for ALL Americans, not just republicans. 2/
You're one step closer to the devil. Hope being a minion pays well.
BTW 30% of MLB players would be banned from competing with "real" Americans if your boss's agenda was implemented. Jerk.
Hey look, it's @bensasse in front of ANOTHER TV camera. Becoming clear that you're in this for the fame, not to help Americans.
Unless you're a black guy who is freezing to death in his truck.
Unctuous
It's a bad day for the majority of Americans who didn't vote Trump. You and you're colleagues only car about the ruling minority. #shameful
Gahead; do what ya gotta do and do it quickly, but you will be hurting workers, hurting minorities and hurting the environment
And one more thing; I don't owe the Koch brothers for his mother; nada
What does Ted Cruz smell like?
Perfectly said.
Vote should be postponed until Senate, House and FBI investigation of Trump & Co. is complete.
nope
why would you vote for a guy who is being put up by a POTUS under investigation?? This makes no sense whatsoever.  NONE.
Lyin Ted?
I respect you're a fan of Gorsuch. I'm not. But baseball has been back since February ... college baseball. GEAUX TIGAHS. @LSUbaseball
What solution do you support if D's propose a filibuster? Are you willing to use the so called "nuclear option"?
baseball was back yesterday, and ***MERRICK*** ***FUCKING*** ***GARLAND*** never even got a hearing.
No day with trump as president is a good day for this country.
Does Ted Cruz smell like yellow, black, or brown baby poop?
Arrest Susan Rice and make it a trifecta.
