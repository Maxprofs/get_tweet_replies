The Emperor has no clothes! Wake up GOP!
We don't want to believe there's moral equivalency between US & Russia but Trump is that equivalency
The thing is, he's not a *legitimate* POTUS, so he's more of a sign that we need vigilance.
he sure settle out of records with his electorial vote win
He's near the bottom in terms of the electoral vote. Stop believing his lies.
bill kristol is the reason I don't buy his magazine anymore
#Agree #POTUS appears #compromised #appoint #SpecialProsecutor #TrumpRussia #save #democracy #resist

unless it's the Clinton mafia and their murderous thugs.   Never forget benghazi
.@ThisWeekABC you're wrong @SenSasse @realDonaldTrump does not "celebrate" a free press. @GStephanopoulos
Republicans never help the people only themselves enough with this party they should be dismantle
@SenatorFischer I'm getting really tired of calling your offices. #letlizspeak VOTE NO ON SESSIONS.
how can you say "The U.S. celebrates freedom of religion" when there is a clear Muslim ban in place?
go SenSasse. Right on
Do you know how many ppl US killed since the end of WW2? You have no moral superiority!
Right on, Finally I heard what I believe.  have to stand up and stop Bannon & Trump from destruction
the republican party's unwillingness to stand up for what's right puts you in the same boat

Russian spy ship traveled through international waters off Delaware coastline, now 30 miles south of Connecticut. http://buff.ly/2kKa7s3  
Ben Sasse can 't  speak of morals when he voted for Trumps corrupt cabinet. Shame! Chicken Little?
Sasse says A, but acts B. Religious freedom? Are u awake?
Senator, you make these statements, then, when voting, support Trump. What are you angling for?
Why are you a rubber stamp to his insanity
.@ThisWeekABC @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos consider agreeing with the President to admit the moral indignation of USA might be suspect.
then do something about it. Write sanctions into law so he can't roll them back Sir
Saw you on MSNBC just now talking all about the 1st amend.  Looks like you weren't worried about
That in schools.  You sounded great but I know you sold kids out today.
I don't know you. But I like you (I think ? ). You sound reasonable.
Isn't Shakil Afridi still in jail in Pakistan??? You are a liar.
Since you voted YES for @BetsyDeVos we'll vote NO for you in 2018. Enjoy your first and last term.
You are a terrible representative of Nebraska. Shame on you. #DeVosvote
all talk while he votes 4 unqualified racist nominees & nothing about racist bannon. Talk is cheap sen sasse
Approval/applauding of Putin's methods is TREASONOUS to American form of government and way of life.
Putin = murder of free thinkers/speakers. NO SUCH THING should be approved of/tolerated by USA.EVER.
good word: thuggery
oh geez rubio is such a piece of dope
please stand tall- vote no on DeVos!
Statements that Trump "allegedly" made?.Is this guy for real? Nothing alleged about it.Its on tape
DO SOMETHING, vote No on DeVos!
Quotes are alleged now. Was the video doctored? This is typical political hedging. No courage!
Thank youfor standing tall!
I am not GOP conservative but week done. I like principled people. Stand up 4 ur beliefs
The Hill agrees with #StopDeVos  Do you?
Putin, Putin, Putin, Putin, Putin, Putin! Russia better than US! Trump your daddy! #MAGA #RIPReagan
open ur eyes Ben -even Lib icon A Dershowitz says theres no diversity of thought anymore-all Liberal
Thank you, Senator Sasse, for speaking up and standing up to the outrageous bully. Truth, not lies.
thank you, Senator. Now, decide if this man is capable of change. Look at his history...
@POTUS  disadvantaged w/negotiations if he stood up & called Putin a murderous thug. Wait for it…
but there is similarity between Ben, George and sphincter!
Seek attention @SenSasse by unraveling the horrors the past admin did w/ weapons around the world!!
U must keep speaking out on Trump, he is crazy and has to go, Putin has the goods on him-prostitutes
Thank you for speaking out, Putin murders opponents/journalists with dioxin, radioactive polonium!!
Thank you Senator for speaking the truth & stating the morals in our country. #CountryOverParty
This is why education is SO important! Words matter. Truth matters. Please, vote NO on DeVos!
Please do not vote for Devos! I admire you, but Ne. Doesn't need her to be sec. Education. Please!
Thank You for ur honesty & Country Before Party @Impeach_D_Trump @ResistanceParty @funder
I respect your courage to speak truth. Denial and lying only hurts USA.
@marcorubio Let's be clear, Trump never said we r same as Russia,  u r making a mockery by twisting
You said kids need better civics education. And, yet, you support devos. Unacceptable.
We can't wait to VOTE you out of office @SenSasse. Expound on a 2 sec clip taken out of context. Shameful.
We don't agree on anything else Ben, but amen to your beautiful takedown. Do not normalize this crap
Republicans-listen to the small voice telling you something is wrong. You can still affect change.
Senator Sasse, speaking out is step one. Thank you. Step two is DOING SOMETHING. We need action now.
Ben is all talk- where the heck is any actions? Wants the good PR but goes along with all policy.
@GOP 
BIG TALK BY THE GOP, BUT THEY DO NOTHING.
damn you Ben everytime I'm out you go and suck me back in. I agree with Little Ben
Awesome. Can't wait for Sen Sasse to lead inquiry into @realDonaldTrump sketchy Russian biz deals.
thank you #myamericandemocracy
at least a modicum of common sense displayed
er um,... Abu Ghraib prison https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_prison … https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/world/cia-torture-guantanamo-bay.html?_r=0 …
unfortunately true and a bad stain on US reputation
Everything Sasse said about Putin describes radical liberal movement from Inauguration to Berkeley.
Well said, Senator Sasse. Thanks for your patriotism.
Then why vote for Tillerson?
Thank you @SenSasse. You are one of the very few GOP members of congress who can be viewed with great respect.
thanks
Whom do you call murderous thugs? Names and when and how many p[people
 were killed/
@John_Scotus @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos Obama's drone attacks killed no civilians ?
@John_Scotus @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos #Chicago #mexicanCartel pretty bad
Prove it @jasoninthehouse @GOPoversight by investigating! What will History say about u
@allanbrauer @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos John McCains son tweeted ( later deleted )
Sir, will you do more than talk?
The concept of moral equivalency is consistent with the persons referenced, but not the two Nations.
The difference between these two systems of government are of Galactic proportions and similarities?
@CNN Ben supports Trump that says it all #trumpputin
thank you Senator.I applaud your words.
that was the best explanation ever. Trump listen. Stop disparaging ever American and body of govt
Thanks 4 speaking out. Pls VOTE accordingly&impress upon Rs 2 look in2 odd affinity bet Russ& Trump.
Everything he described America stands for Trump is against.  Trump WANTS to be like Putin.
all that you stated is under attack by #45; he has degraded the first amendment; are you watching? @GStephanopoulos
Thank you Senator Sasse.
I have never seen putin opponents or journalist that criticism him.
the #FalsePatriots @GOP will defend Trump and Putin in a heartbeat! Flag huggers #Traitors
we "Have To" Remember his name 2018
thank you Senator Sasse. An intelligent comment
Thank you @SenSasse for standing up for America
Neither has any moral authority. Both are soaked in the blood of their victims.
And yet I suspect we don’t see Ben do much to actually push back on Trump.
I like this dude. Who  is he? 
Well spoken... Greets from 
Sane R Senators make me dang giddy.
can you image the righteous indignation from the right had Obama made that statement?! #TRUMP
THANKYOU, Sen.! What I just heard from trump's mouth on Fox interview was SICKENING.#armywife #repub
You made this Nebraskan proud @SenSasse #speakingthetruth
nice to hear the Sen speak up how about some actual no votes as actions? @MSNBC @FoxNews @CNN @KFILE
Thank you, Senator, for standing up to speak truth.
truth?ahahahahahaha!
thank you so much from zip 68521! Ty for answering your office phone too! Proud Nebraskan
@CoryBooker @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos  Then @SenSasse DO something more than just talk. GOP's ALL talk NO action.
the Dems killed SCJ Scalia for late SC appt byBO.  US PoliAssass' norm: JFK,RFK MLK,X,ABE, Oswald
we're no better than anyone else when it comes to poli assassinations #timetogetoffourhighhorse
For this to continue to be true GOP must hold Trump accountable to constitution. Not doing that now.
those examples make it appear #America IS heading toward a moral equivalency with #Russia #TRUMP
excellent arguments why #USA and #Putin thug-state are not equivalent. #Russia is authoritarianism!
Thank you from this US voter for speaking out  re Putin.  You are correct.
#Sasse2020
THANK YOU SENATOR!!!  Regardless of party, WE ARE NOT LIKE RUSSIA, nor are shall we b
You might be surprised.
Everything @SenSasse said about Russia is representative of how Trump thinks & believes America should intact
@GStephanopoulos
I guess he doesn't remember when Obama assassinated by drone an US citizen in Yemen w/o due process
You are right. There can't be equivalency between Russia and the mud at the bottom of the barrel.
. Thank you Sen. Sasse! You're on your way to being the first Republican in decades to get my vote.
So now we have experts on  "moral equivalencies" who judge such
Then how can he possibly support the evil DT agenda when the Prez is Putin's puppet?
"freedom of press" where every single news outlet says the same things?
Immoral U$A, morals are with Russia
a (o)
Trump owes Russia money big money
@JoeTrippi @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos I guess this idiot missed the riots at Berkeley 2 nights ago
there's a mural equivalency between the president and his administration and Putin's thugs
The country needs the President like you, Sen Sasse!
Putin and Trump both have similar goals Made their countries great again.
The democRATS AT IT NON STOP.
Never heard even a good word about 1.6 bil people from our "free press" on the mission
Your so-called president thinks so.
Most BS I ever hear No one in Russia incl. Putin bashing Muslims like in the US, if meant religion
maybe on your birthday moralistic naughtiness in the name of WE the people as whole
@Eminem "total killed it" #wicked #thankyou
@ABCPolitics @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos "Opposition" is not media, nor liberals...it's truth and human decency. Words & actions
America is more universally hated than Russia? What is that?
- is there a moral equivalency between Castro's Cuba, Iran and Putin's Russia? We did business w/ 2
Stop playing Tweets We got it
yes.
@POTUS so called senator sasse more interested in placating the left than protecting USA.
Maybe we should do something.
Trump was asked about killing and he answered that the US also kills, even more than any nation
you are just diverting by talking about freedom/ rights. Talk about the killing
trump blames America first. Republicans should not be OK with this. Thanks Sen.
@MarieTitus9 @ThisWeekABC @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos well Duh....THAT'S what he meant by America First! !!
I guess you haven't met @HillaryClinton
speechless,huh? Now dig in ur bag and pull out a name 2 hide behind!
I have a life, I don't live on TWITTER like you!
u Trump supporters act the same.Throw out insults to detract from issues!
I could say the same about Hillary supporters!
I am a freedom and truth supporter and will call it out regardless of who prez is!
you say that now because Trump won but I know you would not call out Hillary!
except that they wear matching ties and open the door for a woman.
No, we just arm terrorists who massacre millions in our desire to overthrow a govt.
@foxnews
Sasse voters shld vote him out ASAP.
#RINO
.@ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos There's also no moral equivalency of this POTUS to American values @SenSasse just falling in line.
Yeah, Obama drones strikes! Remember! Massacre in Libya!
No they kill their own. Vince Foster
@laprofe63 @SenSasse @GStephanopoulos   

Wink wink nudge nudge - and still supports autocracy
Ben Sasse Social Security & Medicare not enumerated functions of gov in Madison's Constitution. D's & R's = the same
#ThisWeeek
Nor do WE want there to be any chance for equivalence. This is what WE r trying to block w/ tRump!
The @POTUS's point was not to equate the two but to open eyes to the corruption here.
An assumption that I don't believe to be true
If you believe it than you probably need to look in the mirror
Let's now all sit back & look at the content of Republican trump bashing America to @FoxNews BO
Like Putin, @realdonaldtrump trashes FREE PRESS. Time to INVESTIGATE @POTUS's Russian ties.
Sasse Constitution? Socialized retirement is not an enumerated function of the federal government. #ThisWeeek #ABCNews #tcot
We the people voted for 70 yrs for we the people to have a safety net.
You the privilege won't take it away.
Socialized aging not in USA founding docs, but 'HAPPINESS' is. Need Happiness Tax to fund fed agents to distribute Happiness
Ok
Uh Oh!
Is Congress waiting for Trump&co to start poisoning any opponents?
