@SenSasse a typical politician! You're one that needs to get OUT! I changed from Dem to Rep for @realDonaldTrump! Out @SenJohnMcCain too!!
@SenSasse Grateful to have principled Sen with courage to Stand 4 believes The Rep party has compromised betraying the values we stand for.
@SenSasse @joannesmoot Such a climber...Did you endorse CRUZ? NO! You are a phony conservative RINO. SHAMEFUL!
@SenSasse we are out here as conservative or more than you and will vote for Trump. The disaster of Clinton is what the country can't take.
