how often do your kids swim in Nebraska lakes?

.Clean water will be recommended where it can conform to "economically & technologically achievable standards". http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/epa-science-mission-statement-disappearance-donald-trump-white-house-environmental-protection-agency-a7618131.html … #EPA
.Apparently clean water simply isn't economically & technologically achievable in Flint, Michigan
The people of Flint are being threatened with water shutoffs for refusing to pay for poison. My story from there: https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/03/31/flint-residents-were-poisoned-now-theyre-being-billed-for-it.html …

...and no funding for clean water in rural America
good piece from @FrankNewsman and @NPR about #rural in trump budget. these proposed cuts are a big deal. .@cfra http://www.npr.org/2017/03/30/521779563/rural-trump-voters-embrace-the-sacrifices-that-come-with-support …
More "great" news. The @EPA to decrease state funding for monitoring public water systems for lead & ag contaminants
Here's something: EPA is looking to decrease grants that help states monitor public water systems by almost a third. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/climate/trump-epa-budget-cuts.html …
Because who needs clean water? We'll just drink money instead.
Isn't this great reason to go #vegan? Does it sound like ranchers don't want to be accountable for what they put into the water?
Want to go swimming?

The next step is to defund & close all those local environmental organizations that work to ensure #cleanwater

@BenSasse  Congratulations? https://www.google.com/amp/journalstar.com/news/local/report-nebraska-s-waterways-are-th-worst-in-nation-for/article_b52146f6-a1e1-5c97-983c-93eadbf9e03d.amp.html … 
Republicans don't care about the future, only how much $$ they can suck out of the present
but Trump knows what's best for Nebraska's waters? You gotta be f'ing kidding me. At least Obama had conservation in mind.......
...but Trump only sees dollar signs. I wont be voting for you for re-election.
Good. Why would you ever vote for him? Can you name one thing the right has done in last 50 yrs for the people?
JESUS would NOT have supported Civil protections!! He cried out against the many regulations oppressing the poor money lenders!
no Town Hall?! For shame. You have hope that the Republican party still had members with a conscience...a ruse.
Sasse! Whose side are you own! You don't sound like your on President Trump's side!
wow so take out the entire water protection? Wow. Disagree
will you give Nebraska tap water to your children? Ask Flint how bad water turns out. This is not something to cheer about.
.Science? We don't need no stinking science. #EPA #CleanWater #WaterIsLife http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/epa-science-mission-statement-disappearance-donald-trump-white-house-environmental-protection-agency-a7618131.html … #Nebraska
You're applauding environmental decline. For America, for your children, for your great grandchildren. Interesting choice.
So Sasse hates clean water and consumer protection.  Does he also hate puppies?  I guess if Club for Growth does, then he does.
Gees, you'd think you were still on the Ag Committee 
For how much you CLAIM to be "against" the Trump admin, you have ONCE AGAIN marched side-by-side with them and their horrendous...
...propaganda of the day. How do you sleep at night? I'll answer that...you wont when the environment has gone to shit. SHAME ON U
there's exceptions for some wetlands and water areas on private farmland even if it's dry most of the year.
that's why the WOTUS provisions were made in 2015. You wanna go back to that?!?
so putting it in the state's hands isnt such a good idea, eh?
Hope you finish with all your "deregulating" so you can get to stripping my healthcare! Looking forward to all the red tape during paps!
What about the people that need clean drinking water?
thank you for supporting dirty water for Americans.  It is great you want to destroy the environment to appease your Corp masters
forgot-no fricking salmon in Nebraska- so no wonder yu're so stupid re:clean water, wetlands.
. @SenSasse Will you go to a ditch next to a Nebraska farm field, dip in a cup & drink that water in front of news cameras?
Then sponsor a bill that would protect water that you can't waterski in but is nevertheless important & connected to other water.
You're a thoughtful guy & understand complexities of CWA and Rapanos. What replaces WOTUS rule? It's not an easy task.
You are actively working to ruin the world you should be saving for your children. Shame on you and your ignorance.
until they run-out of drinking water for their families
ಠ_ಠ There's nothing more important than clean water and farmers of all people should know that!
Yes but the rest of us will die from polluted drinking water, thanks ... jerk.
But future generations will cry when the water is spoiled for them and their children.
Why didn't you stay on the Ag Committee then?
why does the federalist society even entertain this fool?
i get it. it's not the environment that is the point here. it's using common sense instead of govt nonsense.  good work @BenSasse
what will you do, then, to protect our waterways? What will your response be when they become polluted and undrinkable?
we closed hundreds of unlicensed dumps in Nebraska because of unelected written regs. Most draining into rivers. Was that bad?
I have seen how those Nebraska farmers and industry care about environment. Go to the back corners of their sections and check
funny guy aren't you. Is that pivot chemigating? So no one can write regs to protect our water unless elected? Thanks for nothing,
so they and industry can dump at will in ditches that lead to streams & rivers and if caught delay cleanup with lawsuits for years
How will we protect our aquifer? This is so very important!  How can we keep our waters pristine?
Please listen to scientific facts - help save lives. Farm Bureau lobbyists & others stretch truth. WOTUS good for all NE
clean water, clean air...who needs that shit! #yourkillingtheworld
I can't eat fish out of small lakes & stock dams anymore courtesy of pesticide/herbicide runoff. Nothing like hives w/ fish dinner
Great! polluting and dumping literally shit in our H2O supply is what makes Neb NICE
Can't find one person on this thread who thinks you did a good thing .. not one.  You really are just a rotten Republican apple
the people drinking pesticide laced water might.
They will when our streams rivers and lakes become flow ways for oil
but farmers and ranchers do.   I talk to farmers and ranchers everyday for my job, they are right when they
clearly these folks posting negatively about your tweet don't have a clue what you're talking about
We have always known that republicans want to distroy our water and enviorment. Greed is a sin.
but all of us who like clean water will!
who needs clean water!
Make jokes but If f you live in Kansas you might care about dry streams  water flows down hill ask flint
Now that the EPA has done the right thing let's hope there will be a national recovery of critical thinking skills.
A theologian whose dissertation was on the Moral Majority in the 60's and 70's defining what's constitutional or not? Lol.
Nebraskans do not want polluted water.
Republicans can not be trusted with water. They poison people.
Do you not care about  water purity? Nebraska's farmers & ranchers do. Don't assume they're willing 2 drink and bathe in poison.
can't squeeze water from money!
and dirty runoff water will contaminate the drinking water of 100M people.
Yeah, clean safe water is the last thing Nebraskans want.  Get real, Bennie.
hopefully they shed tears so they can drink them. Because they won't be able to drink the water.
this should be discussed more...with your constituents...at a town hall... #stophiding
WOTUS factcheck: its good for farmers as well as everyone else. Town hall please. Listen to scientists not lobbyists.
written poorly no doubt but pesticides shldnt run into streams so how do u prevent that? Whats r solution?
I doubt it was unconstitutional, at least not as applied to agriculture. But please work to replace. Rapanos is not better.
.@SenSasse You have no idea how a watershed ecosystem works, or what makes something consitutional, or not. Smarter Farming & conservation.
And the rest of us will die from contaminated water.
Cool choice of the word "die" when you're talking about letting people dump crap into America's waters.
right by Stolley Park, well within the city limits. We had a well for our water, and discovered a year after moving in that (2)
Just hope they won't die from drinking toxic water 
THIS ONE ABSOLUTELY PISSES ME OFF SENATOR. AND NOW INC'S CAN DUMP THEIR TOXIC WASTES IN OUR WATERWAYS TOO.
On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being none and 10 being massive...you're an 11 on the clueless scale. #NOMORESASSE
I sure will.
The rest of us won't shed a tear either, mainly because the remaining unpolluted water must be preserved
the people don't need clean water; eff them as long as we have enough to make our profits

Top 10 
Oh look. Such a burden to have to keep water clean. 
thank you for your work on this issue. The EPA is so far out of its lane these days.
why is protecting waters unconstitutional?
because in some cases it isn't good for everyone 
, hey! hey! Pay attention ro my left hand not the right.
How many things left on wish list before trump taxes and ties to Russia are taken seriously? What did you know? And when ? Sad
Nobody cares more? Then why is state gov't, controlled by your party, failing to keep NE waterways clean?
Exactly, thank you Mr. Taggart.
Great news for who?
not cool man.
thank goodness because who wants clean water!!!
Yup. We need to suck it up and just drink what's handed us.
Sounds great.  Now about that pipeline...
You and Scott Pruitt want to repeal the clean water act?  We the people are going to vote you out!
u understand water upstream ends up downstream, right? The rule specifically DOESNT cover ditches. Contrary to ur statement.
wow, just made my day with that great news, think I'll go pollute some intermittent streams later, well done
excellent !
disgusting.
yeah lets get rid of the EPA entirely. Lets get NE rivers to burn like the Cuyahoga!!!!
i, too, hate clean water.
