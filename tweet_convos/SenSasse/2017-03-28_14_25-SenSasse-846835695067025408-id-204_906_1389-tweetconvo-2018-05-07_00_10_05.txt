#RussianSanctions #McCabe #Russia
I want Republicans to remember this day. Releasing a memo they made up to discredit Mueller's probe. Not enforcing Russian sanctions. Trashing the FBI & DoJ, etc. Because when Democrats take control we will have absolutely no mercy when it comes to prosecuting all of them-Period.
"Russian intransigence has elicited no push-back from the White House. Indeed, as the conversation in South Korea shows, President Obama appears determined to ingratiate himself w/ the Kremlin."

#RussianCollusion #Putin #TrumpRussia #NATO
Reluctantly I have concluded that President Trump is a serious threat to US national security. He is refusing to protect vital US interests from active Russian attacks. It is apparent that he is for some unknown reason under the sway of Mr Putin.
Reality
@BenSasse The President of the United States had this to say about Russian interference in American democracy.
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
Proof please???
All true. 

But there are now, on both sides, too many creatures like Devin Nunes, whose antics today make me ashamed that for decades I had been an active member of The GOP until May 2016.

Donald Trump has debased our politics, perhaps irretrievably.
What facts do you have to substantiate this? Any????

It's time to draw the line: any attempt by President Trump to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation would provoke a constitutional crisis.

@MelissaAmour72 

The American government is corrupt. I and many others ARE losing faith in our politicians. Republicans own that.
But the fact is that the Russians did pick a side. And it seems they had good reasons to do so.
would've been much more powerful w/o that swipe at "the democrats" in the circumstances, but still a very important & much needed message
Nebraskans suspect forces within @WhiteHouse conspire w/ Russia to pull at the threads of our public & civic life

Sally Yates…
When Le Pen’s National Front Party could not secure any loans from French banks, she turned to Russia @annanemtsova
You & @BillKristol need to walk hand in hand and take a leap into the #Potomac
You continue to impress me. Please keep reminding us of Putin's objective to destroy our freedom. Many have lost their life protecting it.
Why do you keep acting like such a frat boy w/asinine comments about #Biden would have won a landslide.Grow up election is past.Grow up!
This holier-than-thou Senator is laughing at us. What a fraud.
Psst Ben. I didn't need Russia to convince me Hillary was taking $ from countries worse than Russia & that Congress is corrupt. Known 4 yrs.
No, a really big deal is you selling out your constituent's privacy for a few dollars.
Nothing about Rice. Complete & utter fraud. @SenJohnMcCain & @LindseyGrahamSC boot licker it appears. Disgraceful.
@blackrepublican still waiting for evidence. Which there is still none.
beautiful!
One reason the Trump/Russia story won't stop. Remember that Sen Sasse was attacked by what appeared Russian hacks.
Perfect read!
Interesting rhetoric since you and your party leadership seem to be doing all you can to help them.Please . Nobody's buying it!
You could actually replace Putin's name with Trump when talking about undermining America. Who are you trying to fool here Sasse?
@BenSasse Yep...independent voter fast becoming a Ben Sasse fan!
The overthrow of the USG by the @gop is now complete.
is becoming one of my favorite politicians.
"Whether or not the Trump campaign or its staff were complicit in Moscow’s meddling is missing the broader point" Um, not really.
Please publicly call for Nunes's recusal. We need brave leaders and patriots. Please. This is too important.
Trump is promoting Putin agenda by denigrating NATO, free press, judicial system, and IC. #russiagate
Very informative. I think this relates in some way to the bill to allow cable companies to sell information.
Are you calling for a Special Counsel? If not, why not? As a civilization bending issue, it requires more than partisanship.
@PrincessBravato I applaud you Senstit Sasse you said it all. United we stand divided we fall.
And we are at risk because our public education system grinds out political morons. Defund the Dept of Education
Talk is Cheap. Need Action. #IndependentInvestigation of #TrumpRussia  #Nunes to step down. Then this speech will mean something!
I find it hard to believe that if @HillaryClinton won we would be having this conversation let alone investigations.
Yes we've got trouble, and that starts with T, and that rhymes with P, and that stands for Putin. @SenSasse
Russia's influence campaign is a really big deal. Watch below, then read this: https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-is-ill-prepared-to-counter-russias-information-warfare-1490655558 …

You should stand and demand a new chair in the intel comt. in the House.The more R's that stand up, the more will keep their seats
@Toddkron Is it bigger than or own government and media continually lying to the American people?
TY Senator for sharing the truth about Russia's reasons for interference in our electiom process causing distrust.

Somehow it hasn't occurred to western leaders that the way to stymie Putin's agenda isn't to whine about it but to do a good job
Words, so many words just so much noise. Actions-Deeds. They speak. What now? Remove @DevinNunes-request independent investigation
@Tshetaar2017 BROVO ! BRAVISSIMO! Well done Sen.Sasse ! He is a Republican.
The minute you allow leftist to spew their hate & anti is the moment death destroys the living ...typical resistance Babel 
@ericgarland This is a very powerful speech. Much respect to you Senator.
You make 4 accusations of "doubt casting". All have been an op by @SenateDems, the press and #NeverTrump Republicans. #Projection
Meanwhile: Am I the only one who notices that the gist of your criticism is without factual support?
It is good to see someone (who is not geriatric) talking some sense. Stay Strong. America is Great.
what an Clinton uranium to Russia?  Leaks by NSA!!
THIS MAKES SENSE CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH
We don't need Russia's help in eroding confidence in our government.  Our institutions are doing a fine job destroying themselves.
@ericgarland Congressional Dems are screaming for a legit investigation. Your party is functioning as a crime syndicate. Please.
#NunesMustResign
TY! You nailed it, this is not a partisan matter, it's about our democracy and sovereignty as a nation at risk!  .
End the corruption and treason. Independent investigation NOW.
The GOP's do nothing approach has further harmed us.  The tax reform agenda is a higher priority to the GOPs than the people.
Sasse votes with Trump on Senate floor.
I hope Sasse puts country before party because this will stain GOP in ways they can't even imagine for a LONG time.
shocked that people hacked were so careless but, the hacks brought out true&damaging statements from emails hacked not fake news
@PoliticusSarah we must have a bipartisan approach or we are going to lose this fight. He is right please listen!
@ericgarland all of it could end if 45&Republicans tell the truth&let the truth come out!This is what is giving Russia power! End!
Why is CONGRESS so inept at getting the facts? Why were you elected to office if we cannot trust the process in Congress??

@SenSasse is the one guy I have hoped would not disappoint us. He seems like he has genuine integrity and trusted by serious conservatives.
@ericgarland can someone explain why Nunes seems to have unilateral decision making authority? He cancels testimony at will, etc.
@ericgarland If you don't have any confidence in "our self-government" to begin with, you're immune to Russian influence.
@ericgarland Then stand up for Country not party!
Foreign influence undermined my confidence in our government long before the 2016 election. #AIPAC2017 #America2nd
What you described about undermining values - that is what ttrump is doing - he is working on PutIn's agenda.
Then @SenSasse needs to be front and center pushing for an independent investigation, and out of the hands of Trump puppets @ericgarland
why don't you deal with DNC corruption?
You are a good man
@ericgarland Aren't you a Republican? Props man, props. This wouldn't be happening even if Ted Cruz was president.
Wow! Thank you, Senator, for speaking truth to power. You are a courageous man and worthy of respect and honor.
tired of the authoritarian leadership in this country! since when does the government have the right to tell us what we can do?
we live in a republic, you guys say democracy, even when we do things by democracy if you guys disagree you say no
a republic means individual rights! stop the oppression! even when the majority votes to legalize marijuana you guys say no!
No victim no crime! Consenting adults should have the liberty to smoke weed if they want to! millions have voted for it!
I retweeted your thoughtful speech on Russia & our institutions. Now I call on u2 press for deep bipartisan investig'n.  No Nunes.
it's our god given right to do what we have to to feed ourselves! you guys have no right to tell us what we can and cant do!
we are tired of oppressive laws! we have families to feed and need to put clothes on their backs! legalize marijuana!
@JohnJHarwood #Project2020
The way I read this is Russia was and is trying to undermine Trump and everyone else. So now what?
Russia did not influence our election! the corruption and Obama's NWO agenda influenced the peoples vote! Trump says what we think
@JohnJHarwood - no one would know it, given the Ringling Bros show in the chamber next door ...
Please Buddy, I like some of the things you say if you really mean them hence supporting the constitution! but lay off Russia!

sir, why do you support confirming a Supreme Court nominee from Trump when he's under investigation?
@JohnJHarwood And TRUMP is the victim?
@JohnJHarwood so...independent commission?
@JohnJHarwood impeachment needs to be on the table.
Perhaps what amazes & disgusts me most is the Trumpets who are ok with this. Their ignorance is a badge. Un-American
This should matter to all Americans. Putin has an agenda and he is using it against the United States
@HotlineJosh Thank you Sir. We need more @GOP Patriots. Please support the investigation. We demand the truth.

Putin as a threat to American values and institutions?  Senator, if you had only listened to  Dems you would know his1/2
his real sin was to make Hillary look bad! 2/2
country over party, honor and duty over self, interest.  Stand for what you know is right.  We will not forget you. #Trumprussia
Thank you! As as American I paid little attention to Congress in the past decades. I am paying attention now. We need unity.
Thanks Senator 4 your comments & the article. Q: Other than being informed & voting--can citizens do anything?
@BenSasse Ben Sasse really really likes affirmations from the far left that believe in wild conspiracy theories.
~ conspiracy theorist pats Ben on head and asks 'who's a good boy, huh? Who's a good boy? You Ben, yes you are!"
wish I could, but the article is behind the paywall 
.@BenSasse, @SenSasse is starting to grow on me too.
That needs to be understood by your fellow Repubs.
Thank you for speaking up & for sharing that informative article. We have no choice but to fight this war. Fight we must.
@BenSasse Where can I find your full speech?
If you were serious about this sir, you would be publicly admonishing your house colleagues and calling for Nunes' recusal.
@BenSasse Appreciate the call to be self-critical in how we respond to foreign trolls.
@BenSasse no need to thank me just an angry citizen doing my job. Be great if you did yours.
@BenSasse Speaking of influence, I'm dumbstruck in love with your feed since I sent this. No trolling from me thru tax day! 
Oh! Did you find the details in Hillary's emails ??
should have equally criticized #GOP 4 fact-finding obstruction & #Trump direct & reckless praise & alignment w #Putin
THIS is the only thing we should be talking about until we come to grips w it; #China & #Russia could team up;
Thank you sir, I disagree w/ your politics, but we need each other to function as a nation, and we are equal as citizens @SenSasse @BenSasse
Thank you for speaking out with humility and true patriotism. I hope your advice is heeded by colleagues on both sides.
I would sooner trust Russia over trusting Iran
@BenSasse then put your country before your party and call for an #IndependentInvestigation of #Trumprussia
we cannot continue to allow Putin to push his agenda and president on us! #NunesRecusal #IndependentInvestigation
keep it up senator
Thank you for speaking out; but, if the Trump campaign was complicit it's not "missing the broader point." It's treason.
Actions speak louder than words. Independent investigation required. Where's your speech for that?
@BenSasse bla bla bla
this WSJ article says Russia's electoral interference victimized TRUMP. @SenSasse, this is not the plainspokenness people credit you with
If Russia threat 1st A, China dictating shut down Internet freedom not? Witch hunt w Russia. Not word China/NK. Ur agenda is NATO!
@BenSasse Muh Russia!!!!! 
@BenSasse Watch these remarks by Putin from 2013
Putin: Western Civilization "going extinct" - low birth rates & political correctness https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzJMmtxgPPs …
@BenSasse I think Europe will soon need US and Russia to work together to rescue it from Holy Wars (see Erdogan remarks)
U pontificate NATO, but not on Intel Committees? Ur agenda clearly backs NATO & threats U can't tell? Trust U about NATO? Right.
well said

@BenSasse  it's nothing like America's influence campaign.....but I digress
@BenSasse so DO something about it!!!!
@BenSasse agreed! But the average American can't do anything about it. Where is the outrage in Congress particularly the @GOP?!?
You only moved the needle to 1 on the sincerity meter. Try harder
Remember, you can't spell Trump or Nunes without Putin. (Ancient Russian proverb.)
@BenSasse thank you for this!
Please act to protect US! I don't care which party you belong to, now is the time to be in the American party, not Putin's USsrofA
@BenSasse well, it's up to u guys in Senate cuz @DevinNunes & @jasoninthehouse look like tools.
We are all Americans, and we all need to work together. There are true patriots in both parties. Sasse is one. God bless
More concerned about Democrats "using" Russia to"pull at the treads of our public and civic life"
@BenSasse thx for speaking out. You get it, why don't your colleagues? Saw you in the hearing on Russia. Well done. Keep pushing.
Should Nunez recuse?
@BenSasse was it a big deal when Madame Clinton was influence peddling? Or should foundation donations  be overlooked?
Sasse for President!  I'm in...
Yes but what are you personally going to do about it @SenSasse? Will you demand a truly indep. investigation or are you just checking a box?
Please call for Nunes to recuse. Country over party.
I think there are better things to do like REPEAL OBAMACARE!!! It would take 5min and one page to do. Pretty sure that's your job
@BenSasse I"ll watch yours; I hope you"ll read mine ; the ongoing coup attempt is a bigger deal http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446148/russian-farce-trump-collusion-hysteria-diverts-attention-surveillance-scandal …
"Putin wants us to believe that our own institutions are as corrupt as his 'thugocracy'". That's what our Pres says too.
How can that be Pres. Obama said there was no problem with Russia back in Oct. Wow this came up so suddenly (sarcastic remark)
Look at what the GOP has passed with this administration. Why would you vote for citizens' info to be sold to highest bidder?
So you do or you don't back an independent investigation into Trump Russia? And you do want Nunes to step down? #TrumpRussia #Jail
I want you to be our president!
cut the crap, you for this investigation or not? Stand up for the truth if you want to wear the big pants.
thank you.
That one can substitute 'Trump' for 'Putin', Senator; that's what YOU have to deal with first and foremost.
all good words we can agree on. And still no action... WHAT WILL YOU DO TO ENSURE OUR DEMOCRACY IS SOUND? #SpecialProsecutor
...it's about the orange dude @ 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. And every second that passes w/0 u saying it is, is a blow to democracy.
I smell a Primary looming.... having tweeted that, kudos to the Senator.
