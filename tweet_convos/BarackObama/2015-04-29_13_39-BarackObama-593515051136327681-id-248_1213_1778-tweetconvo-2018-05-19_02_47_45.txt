@BarackObama your Ed policies are garbage
@BarackObama pay those bills in cash? um no. Now we pay more to the insurance company than we used to be able to save for the future.

@BarackObama sorry, but I'm always going to remember you as someone who charmed us all with hope and change but we saw none of it.
@BarackObama Many find you evil & difficult, stuff I went through.  WHY? Who knows why? Just that being strong is what's needed. Be strong.
@BarackObama at any rate, the education our children get is pathetic unless your child is behind.For those ahead they're just stuck.

@BarackObama Only a complete imbecile or ignorant Obama voter would believe Republicans caused these issues in a Democrat state Maryland
@BarackObama I believe US curriculums don't benefit most. Money management is not required but Algebra is? Why?
@BarackObama THEN GIVE PARENTS A CHOICE, AND STOP TRYING TO BREED IGNORANT VOTERS LIKE YOU DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE THE 60's
@BarackObama need to get rid of Common Core so teachers can actually teach again. And love doing it!
