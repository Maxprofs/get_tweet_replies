@BarackObama are you in Kenya Mr. President?
@BarackObama He sounds so pathetic when he is off prompter. You almost feel sorry for him. It's because of him and Sharpton that they riot
@BarackObama  
Obama you are a symbolism and a piece of history- in reference to 1st black president. But you have yet to make history with
@BarackObama 
With a direct constitutional uncompromising decision to at least put forth the effort. Stop being a buffer for a falling power
@BarackObama 
Ok you may end up like Martin, Malcolm. ...
But Yolo. ... might as well go out fighting. Stop being a coward and call it like
@BarackObama 
It is. History is only elapsed time with stories attached to it. But history makers (Marcus, Malcolm, Martin, Che, Elijah, )
@BarackObama 
Are forever etched in time.
@BarackObama love you for this law
