@BarackObama You are a fricking idiot for attacking coal fired energy plants and causing more economic problems for US CITIZENS and business
@dbrad4d @BarackObama oh dear another ill-informed(byChoice)Not only US citizens R being affectd by GloblWarming.FossilFuels destroyngFuture
@bensab3 @dbrad4d @BarackObama  Climate change is a hoax. You don't have to change the name of a cause multiple times if it's not a sham.
@stp00 @bensab3 @dbrad4d @BarackObama Nope,and neither is Al Goreleoni or Barry. The dipshit thinks a hoax is more dangerous than ISIS.
@Knight1510 @stp00 @dbrad4d @BarackObama Y do U think polluting r atmosphere w GHGases a 'hoax'?Is t that U don't want to be inconvenienced?
@bensab3 Many of the scientist that agree with the hoax aren't the kind that would know anything about it.  Tell Gore to sell his mansion.
@Knight1510 Pardon cld U elaborate on preposterous statm't,preferably wth som solid proof. All th scientists R ClimateScientists,peerReviewd
@BarackObama hey President Pussy, solar and wind aren't producing enough power for US CITIZENS and Business needs! Coal does!
@dbrad4d @BarackObama well the economy is doing very well under his policies so I don't see what you think the issue is.
@the_daveeed wait until you grow up, go to college (have lots of student loan debt), try to get a job and pay your own way before you talk.
@dbrad4d I am going to college, and because of scholarships and financial aid I'm not going to leave college with overwhelming debt. :-)
@20bo20bo @the_daveeed who are you posing your question to?
@20bo20bo @dbrad4d an educated country is a good one. European countries have realized this and pay for their peoples education
