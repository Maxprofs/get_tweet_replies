This is another legacy of the @POTUS You deserve the third term.

It is obvious you are part of them. You lack the right statistics. Who started the war? Who inherited bad economy? @POTUS44 fixed to things
obviously you dont & wont accept realty as a result the American people have voted you out of Congress, House & WH. live in denial its fine.
Let us wait for next election. Turntable politics. We will soon have our dance. As for you Mike...you may consider contesting for a seat.
No thanks I love my country Israel more than you do. You may want to rethink what you guys are doing to your country
Mike, I see where you are coming from. Your PM Net. has got a lot of fraud allegations to answer. By the way, let us grant Palestine state.
Like I've said, refusing to accept realty is a problem but hopefully something you can overcome soon, I'm sure cheering from the side lines
@techgif2 not for long I hear! Isn't trump to stop all with basic income.  It won't cover costs!
At whose expense...
He did... it's called F U.
Folks, make the ACA better by putting Democrats in the WH, Senate, House. A billionaire GOPer isn't going to help you one bit!
HAHAHAHA... are you serious? Who do you think's paying?
I am.
And the rest of the average joe American...
 What are you getting at? And let's leave the President's twitter feed out of this.
Good morning
Riiiiight. . . and unemployment is under 5%, too.
 Go fuck yourself, you lying sack of shit
Lie Lie Lie
but the price is going up if you were serious it would be a one payer system for all and you control costs but it all about u
freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. After freezing the account, remitted back to the United States,
Three more months.
ten why is 58% of America want to repeal and replace @obamacare ?? Your head is in the sand
you mean they are forced to over pay
That is a false claim. More and more are losing coverage for high premiums.
fake number!
@techgif2 Another whopping lie coming from THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER!
thank you...may God bless and be with you and yours... I have a piece of stainglass art I would like to give to you, but how?
Thanks to you, Baby Barack!!!

YOU'RE A JOKE MR PRESIDENT!
October07
91% of people o know still can't afford it. That number is false
crap healthcare with rising premiums and costs. Insurance across 50 states  competition drives costs down not rocket science
what a freaking Lie
its collapsing you smuck
at a outrageous cost, this has done well
and most of them are on public aid thanks Barry

because if we don't, we get punished.
good job Mr. Obama. We love you.
unaffordable health care, big government needs to stay out of this, the proof is in the pudding, Big Deal=you out of Wh House
no they don't it was proven yall didn't even meet last months goal and goal before that
thank you! My daughter and I are grateful for our health coverage, Mr. President. Thank you again and again. God bless you.
(2/2) In 4/11 she was able to get PCIP coverage. Because of this she lived 3.5 years longer. If she had coverage earlier - ??!
My sister couldn't get major med -pre-existing conditions. In Jan 2011 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. (1/2)
and all your health data belongs to the NSA

Just got email today at work. "rates will increase about 10.5% versus current year with no change to the benefits. not working
Who's paying for it?
it should be 100% you greedy corporate led corrupted politicians!
@ChelseaClinton and thanks for making my insurance unaffordable.
because your forcing people to pay money for health. Single payer is the answer
that they can not afford and was forced upon them. Taxed for having a heart beat.....Calling BS
I now pay more than 20% of my salary in premiums-I make less than $65k. My plan is worse now too. I wish I was exempt like you.
Grande Obama
THANK YOU POTUS....YOU WILL BE THE BEST ON SCOTUS TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is a really big joke you mean, I want my own doctor not one the government picks. Thanks pal.. #trumppence
yes, due to the DOUBLING of welfare.
Obamacare was supposed to lower health care costs. What happened? Were you just making that up to get it passed?
You are an awesome president.
6 years later, 33 mill still don't have health insurance, and premiums have skyrocketed. http://spkrryan.us/2cyrc8w  #ObamaLegacy
you're kidding right lol god you're such a shitty president
maybe because you are forcing them to have it?
meanwhile I have to fight the VA to not have a two month wait time for mental health while thieves are allowed to run the place
and we pay dearly for pure & others , that's not good by any measure
yeah because you threaten to find us if we didn't have health insurance
I would not be tweeting this had you not stepped up the the plate for me and millions of others! #ThanksObama
the bigger deal is most middle class Americans can't afford it and can't afford 6500$ deductible
*Tells people to get his healthcare or they have to pay thousands* ... *Acts like it's an accomplishment when they sign up*
Proof? Oh I forgot liberals don't use that
your Obama care made our rates go up 200%. Now what do you have to say
"Health care is the key to implementing socialism" Saul Alinsky
Saul Alinsky said If you implement social health care socialism will naturally work its way into the fabric of the country.
which will go up 2000% in November Thank you Obama for bankrupting us
Thank you for the Healthcare, and more importantly the Hope!
It's not sustainable w/ Health ins Co's. leaving program. Single payer must b an option. I feel like I wasted my vote on you
@NegronDoc Shitty health coverage. We need single payer! You are a failure, Obama. Plus, Hillary hates you!
that sir is just plain bullshit
@HillaryClinton @politico @realDonaldTrump @GovPenceIN

#NnamdiKanu Killed no one, granted 2 times unconditional bail but #Buhari still keep him in prison. #FreeNnamdiKanu
Obamacare was not number one on our list most of us already have medical insurance in some cases better then Obamacare
icymi most people can't afford your pathetic healthcare
And my premiums and co pays gas sky rocketed, thanks for nothing 
GREAT JOB... Still a lot work to get our homeless into health care
#No$40MillionBookDeal Obama will have concierge service the elite 1%er hypocrite.
most you haters lying you didn't have health insurance no way before obamacare stop lying!
this is 1 of the largest mistakes ever signed into law and you destroyed the middle class by signing it. Forgive me if I don't
.@BarackObama Thank you, Mr President.
yeah, except were paying out the ass for insurance that doesn't cover shit, my doctor had to close an office b/c of you!
bull. i do not believe the #s and the ones who do have coverage are using my money to pay 4 it!
inadequate health coverage isn't better than none fix the system

coverage?
Wrong again! Over 50% of those have insurance which have dropped Obama-careless. SO, how can you call them "insured"? #ObamaLie
Hospitals are cutting staff to stay open because of Obamacare. Decreased reimbursement=cut staff+increased volume. Smart move.
*Some* Americans now have {lousey ass Obamacare} health coverage b/c they were *forced* into taking it or pay a penalty.
This is a fantastic achievement!
That's a lie

Obama care is awful! You lied about the whole thing!
@dscc 
where does the Obama health care money go? And what good is health care coverage if it doesn't cover "health care?"
so why can't people use it? And where?????
Great job President Obama!   The state of Georgia leaders will learn one day to appreciate your leadership!
...our goverment also catch the achievement
no boy..
@RyanVitera Truth.
I have friends that can't afford it and my premium and deductibles more than doubled.
obamacare also fines people and is bullshit, it raised my health insurance.  Go all the way and give free health care.
great man, wish you could be our prime minister in the UK. 

You got my vote if you do lol
good news for the normal citizens about health care. Good luck!
wow that must be a good feeling to know Obama care is working despite all the republican opposition. You made a difference!
BULLSHIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a really big deal.
wish I wasn't unconstitutionally forced to have health care now when I wasn't before you. Obama you're a hack.
very best events.
oh yeah!
@ChelseaClinton
!!

ey amerika benim nefretimi katmerleştiriyorsun bilki bu dünyanın nefretidir
great news
For the first time ever doctors are spending over 75% of their revenues to cover operating expenses.
Have you seen the homeless tent camps piping up all over the USA?
We'll miss you, Mr. President! 
@WhiteHouse @SgyYogarajah IN EVERY FIELDS YOURS HAVE DONE MORE THAN ENOUGH .MADE MANY FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE UNITY AS IN PARIS +
Next can we get healthcare that doesn't arbitrarily decide not to cover things? #UnitedHealthcare
now just requires a reduction of the 91% of ads on American TV being about health care medication

Our renewal shows premiums 3X those of 2009 for a family of 4.  "Working" depends on who is paying the bill.
