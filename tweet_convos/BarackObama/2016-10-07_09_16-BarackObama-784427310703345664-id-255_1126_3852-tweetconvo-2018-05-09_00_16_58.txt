Cottage industry for clean environment, maximum employment & decentralised economy;  Technological revolution to kill all these
94 mill out of work, and those 15 million "jobs" we're mostly part time to avoid Obamacare. Record poverty & foodstamps.U lie.
#Ronaldgod
@HillaryClinton @billclinton good job
Obama / Hillary total GDP growth in 8 years < 10%. Reagan total GDP growth in 8 years > 36%. Vote Trump for jobs & econ growth.
You want fries with those 15.3 million jobs?
This must be illuminated   for their are those amongst us who want believe that nothing has been done more them.
There have been 6 million less jobs created than working age population growth & Hillary / Obama still push open borders.
I'm going to miss you mate, let's hope that there still will be an America this December.
95 mil working age Americans out of labor force b/c no jobs. They are no longer counted & are not in the unemployment rate
how many has it lost and how may people are no longer looking for work? Those are more important questions.
and you have absolutely NOTHING to do with it!!
sure
all low paying too. No more high pay jobs in America.
Why don't you tell the #truth about unemployment numbers? Oh, yeah, truth is not in your vocabulary #lyingliar
smoke & mirrors.
yep low paying i can bearly pay my bill an live a decent life jobs #HonorLabor @unions4workers @Labor411
That is not the "net" jobs. A deceptive claim to say the least.
20 trillion in the hole. Multiple wars screwed up..and 2 new ones coming.. let's worry about the weather? Give me a break
Respected Sir
