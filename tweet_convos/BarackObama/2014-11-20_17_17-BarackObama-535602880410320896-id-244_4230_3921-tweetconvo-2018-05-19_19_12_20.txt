.@barackobama Yes, but I got 2degrees,yrs of experience and I cannot come & work in the US!!! Should I be an illegal?!?#ImmigrationAction
@Mr_Mbb @BarackObama What a hate filled man you are ...
@cletisstump 1) who are you?; 2) why?
@Mr_Mbb Your most recent tweets are indicative of a man who thinks only of himself irrespective of the importance of the broader issue ...
@cletisstump Not at all: I must refuse jobs because companies don't sponsor me and the system is discriminates me. Quality must be rewarded
@Mr_Mbb Quality? A field hand who embodies dignity exhibits quality. It isn't just about a *technical * skill.
@cletisstump I give up. Goodbye. #myfault
@Mr_Mbb You have to admit that your first reflex to this speech was about yourself ...
.@BarackObama LEGAL immigrants - like my grandparents, and the millions you just pushed out of the line, you low life pos.
@YerboutiSheik He had Gruber do a cost benefit analysis on that, so its gotta be true. @BarackObama

@BarackObama @britjfrain This is correct, but it also depends on them becoming citizens & paying taxes, rather than just "taxing the system"
@BarackObama We are a history of Legal Immigration
@BarackObama @riotta facile chi ha un lavoro, non delinque, non è terrorista........gli altri vengano da noi ...."ce lo dice l'Europa".....
@BarackObama still struggling to be accepted as president. Everything you do is for popularity. Nothing for the people
@BarackObama But other sides are at net loss

@BarackObama A net plus in taking our jobs.  Over 70% of all new jobs went to immigrants.  That number too low for you?
@BarackObama You mean that part of history where immigrants came in legally and were eager to become Americans? That history?
Finally, that change @BarackObama: "Our history shows that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society." #ImmigrationAction”

@BarackObama Our history is about law. Lawful immigration is good, lawlessness is bad. A nation that supports lawlessness can't remain free.
