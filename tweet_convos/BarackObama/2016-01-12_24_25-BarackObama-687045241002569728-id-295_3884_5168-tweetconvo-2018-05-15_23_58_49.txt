@WhiteHouse Good job! He would deserve four more years if it was possible!
@Bart_VDV @WhiteHouse he loves making up laws all on his own so don't give up hope. Maybe he can use executive actions to give him 4 more.
@KeensHeather @mikechampion40 @WhiteHouse In my opinion, He did well compared to its predecessor, ma'am.
@Bart_VDV @KeensHeather @WhiteHouse if you think that, then you are indeed delusional. Hes caused irreparable harm to the country.
@mikechampion40 @KeensHeather @WhiteHouse Who do you think is the best choice to become the next president, sir?
@Bart_VDV @KeensHeather @WhiteHouse someone who will not attempt to divide the country along racial, gender, and economic lines.
@mikechampion40 @Bart_VDV @KeensHeather @WhiteHouse On day one the Repugs decided not to coooperate!
@WhiteHouse Lies and nonsense. Real Unemployment is over 16% & more people underinsured than ever in history.
@Larry_CliffrdSr @WhiteHouse Source?
@SJMLsl @WhiteHouse Pre-Common Core Math my dear.
@Larry_CliffrdSr Don't be condescending what is your source?
@SJMLsl Mathematics pure& simple. Over 27,000,000 able bodied workers no longer counted because not on Unemployment rolls. Still Unemployed
@Larry_CliffrdSr 27M able bodied workers doesn't mean they are unemployed.  It's called choice.
@SJMLsl Dirty Rotten Obama tactics
@Larry_CliffrdSr Obama changed the method gov't uses to track UE is what you are saying? Prior to 2009 it was done differently? Really???
@WhiteHouse Too bad tornadoes, hurricanes, ISIL, floods, ice storms, earthquakes aren't paying attention! @POTUS
@DubeRandy @WhiteHouse @POTUS Yeah because gouvernement can really change the weather.
@Scarbir @WhiteHouse @POTUS Not the weather, nimrod, the Buildings, infrastructure, power & transportation grids. That is what's failing.
@DubeRandy @Scarbir  Talk to Congress.
@SJMLsl @Scarbir I have, they just pass new ideas around or back to local jurisdictions. I won't spend a dime lobbying, so they not hearing.
@DubeRandy @Scarbir gNop hates regulations.  They believe the "free" market will take care.  Clearly Flint Mi is paying for that
@WhiteHouse Bravo

@KeensHeather @WhiteHouse must be in a resist ACA state and your state gov is making you suffer to spite the ACA
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama NICE.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I LOVE YOU
@WhiteHouse If unemployment is so much better, and more are insured, why the uproar indicating the need for a raise of minimum wage?
@WhiteHouse You forgot oil price plunge to pre Bush war,911 levels.

@WhiteHouse @daveyk317 Almost all of that economic recovery post GFC has gone to the parasite 1% which owns the GOP & Dems, & caused crisis.
@WhiteHouse This proves that Obama is a good president and that the Democratic party has improved the nation!
@WhiteHouse @Alasscan_ I like it when the Republican Party gets to give #SOTU responses; keep it up 4 the for next 50 years #Hope
.@WhiteHouse @Cowry_Limousine 

Pissing on America & telling the country it's positive change is BS!
@WhiteHouse the unemployment rate is well above 5%, the debt is $18T, we're at war again but nah you did a great job O.
@WhiteHouse @donnabrazile Those Republican Governors, state legislatures, and frackers sure saved Obama's bacon.
@WhiteHouse @Pinonica bahahaha
