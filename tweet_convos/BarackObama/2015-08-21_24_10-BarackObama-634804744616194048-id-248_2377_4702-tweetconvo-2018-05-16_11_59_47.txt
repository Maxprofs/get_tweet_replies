@BarackObama @USArmy #respect
Be wary of the person reluctant to assume blame, but eager to accept credit. @BarackObama
@YahiaLababidi More applicable to the Bush family than @BarackObama I think.
@MiraKarell @YahiaLababidi @BarackObama -It's obvious that you don't pay attention.
Sorry not pro gun. Freedom is precisely to do away with them & end senseless, innocent deaths... @MichaelShifflet
@YahiaLababidi -and freedom is the right to keep and bear arm's in the United states to protect the innocent.
@BarackObama @USArmy This is the TERRORIST IN CHIEF LEGACY

@BarackObama @USArmy they're not Rangers. Ranger school is a leadership course taught by the 75th Ranger Regiment
@BarackObama @USArmy graduating from Ranger school makes you "ranger qualified" but you're still a member of your orig unit

@BarackObama @USArmy I think it is the right thing to allow women to become rangers if they complete the same training the men have to.

“@BarackObama: Today, two women are making history—becoming the first to graduate from the @USArmy's Ranger School: http://ofa.bo/d53L ”
@BarackObama @USArmy par contre les cheveux elles auraient pu les gardées!
