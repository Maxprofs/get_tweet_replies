@GinoPlaysDrums @WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why not? Your here talking trash when you probably don't know what you are talking about.
@GinoPlaysDrums I would but then it would just be garbage like you turning the whole world into a landfill.
@WhiteHouse ~The inception of the #ACA, through the #judicialprocesses involved,most certaintly is the #ScamoftheCentury!
#Grubergate
@WhiteHouse Shame on you, Southern and Plains states! I'm ashamed as a citizen of Florida... Health Insurance is a RIGHT, not a PRIVILEGE...
@WhiteHouse Obamacare eliminates preexisting conditions.  It saved our family!
@WhiteHouse In a free country refusing shouldn't be a problem, the government makes it a problem. So point to yourself and solve it.
@GIC_Controle @WhiteHouse if what you say is true, then it should be up to the individual to refuse free healthcare and not the state 
@VeeVee @WhiteHouse Thus, the USA isn't "the land of the free" anymore. Time to act.
@WhiteHouse Eliminate Medicaid/care. Adjust ACA. Actively address health costs. It's possible: #PSYCHplan #ACAfail #nocopay
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Need more tweets like this to educate those states of what they are missing by opting out
@chiapet14 @WhiteHouse thanks for the  retweet
@cwillie9961 @WhiteHouse Are you there or RTing them? Thank You for telling me!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what's good for the whole? Expansion is.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama States can not refuse - It's higher government - >S< OFA LEADER

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama GOOD  STATISTICAL. ( Young  Manager  ANA CLÁUDIA  BRASIL -Brasília-DF ).
@WhiteHouse in your pic it says they are already uninsured, so they are leaving them uninsured.
@WhiteHouse you know, that number would drop to 3.2 if we just let Texas go... #foodforthought #justanidea
@WhiteHouse the vision always not cost, but on  its mission and implementation cost is high.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yet Florida Legislators have no problem with FL taxpayers subsidizing THEIR health care then vote NO again 2 needy!

@WhiteHouse @CABird6  FACT:  Those supporting #TPP help to raise prices of medicines here and abroad.
@WhiteHouse Yes, because nothing says Liberty & Freedom quite like Force & Coercion.  What f'ed up reality do you want to live in?
@WhiteHouse Fact: it is not the states responsibility.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse The conservative proposals for health care ... wait, ACA looks just like Bob Dole's plan & Mitt Romney's plan! Oh, the issue is?
@WhiteHouse Lets really put their panties in a knot & adopt a single payer system! Then they can be "free" 2 find a nation w/out health care
@WhiteHouse For some reason that eludes me conservatives are proud of US being for sick children & poor elderly. Hmmm, deplete the surplus?
@WhiteHouse There's convoluted reasoning for you; you are free 2 not pay 4 insurance but ER is not free 2 turn the sick away. ACA is cheaper

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I'm 62, had cancer and chemo, no insurance, and fit into that donut hole, Fl. governor/people just don't get it!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama A lot of ppl can't afford medical and they're being forced to buy it or they get penalized! That's WRONG!
@WhiteHouse I live in one of those states, (VA). It's a travesty. I would like to see the federal government overrule those states.
@WhiteHouse Glad to live in WA State
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama To all beautiful girls loyal to God, escape from U.S.A. come to Mexico, the new bridge between Arab and the fworld

@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama every person deserves healthcare! Especially children! MEDICAL MATTERS!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama For those reasons the ACA should consider a window of additional enrollments to allow demand to catch up new hires
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama This factors into ACA enrollment by slowing the process people can file due to graded rate requirements. (2)
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Right to Work States are very stingy with labor stats to employees. many do not provide paycheck stubs(1)
@WhiteHouse some of us have difficulty believing healthcare financial access benefits the wellbeing of us all
@whitehouse yes, unfortunately our Governor's dislike of the democrats won out over the underserved
@WhiteHouse https://www.linkedin.com/company/brokerville …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama   tnx
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What about with holding federal funding when states don't comply with federal programs like affordable health care.
@WhiteHouse It figures that #Florida would be one of them.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Think about how many people you leave uninsured with obamacare. That doesn't bother you we see.
@WhiteHouse @HHSGov CRIMINAL SHHHTUPIDITY IN THE NAME OF POLITICS
@WhiteHouse @HHSGov ongoing twitter and fb movement, #expandmedicaidnow
@WhiteHouse @HHSGov @RickScottUpdate Get with the program Gov Scott! #expandmedicaidnow
@WhiteHouse Don't worry about me being uninsured. I have faith in God not your exploitation of desperation and  fear.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @FardigJudith And in most of those states the uninsured vote #GOP. #dumb
@WhiteHouse @vj44 @POTUS don't you folks know anything other than blatant propaganda & vicious lies. PLS STOP! SMH

@WhiteHouse  If I didn't live in Michigan I would have not been able to go to the doctor and get the antibiotics I needed
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama the people need this medicaid program. I'm from Texas. This the worst state for help!
@WhiteHouse Why aren't healthcare providers, Churches, etc standing up and speaking out about this? It's absolutely shameful!
@WhiteHouse everyone might have a different idea if they didn't have any healthcare
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama RT FAV R.T.E
@WhiteHouse -Fact ...the Government can not force a free nation to buy something we don't want.
@WhiteHouse @terri_georgia They don't care. They want them to die so they don't have to spend any money on them.
@WhiteHouse I hear Republicans are planning on replacing Obamacare. It's called We Don't Care.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama let's be clear about that map. Those grey states are really red states,  but I guess most were in the confederacy.
@WhiteHouse the waiting can suck #letsnottakethingsforgranted where health is concerned
@WhiteHouse I wouldn't be here today w/o the cdn health system being free in Manitoba but I can understand y ud want better too
@WhiteHouse We need those people in the system so that when costs shoot up next year, it is that much more money for govt. or whoever.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what is wrong with the leaders of these state who are hurting Americancitizens.
@whitehouse @barackobama  actually ADM should stay OUT of state's business even with ACA
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama the state should not be able to speak for the individuals, that's not freedom.
@WhiteHouse @FlaDems
FACT: could've been avoided if @POTUS had NOT imposed fraudulent #Obamacare scheme on unwilling nation.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama come up with better and figure it out instead of bickering and whining. Try doing a better job! Don't dictate!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Surprise Surprise Texas is refusing to expand medicaid coverage
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Funny how it's all the dumb parts of the country.
@WhiteHouse: "FACT: States refusing to expand Medicaid through the ACA are leaving 4.3 million…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=606473679682203649 …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why is it that America, has more problem with a free health care system, than EU countries. Lobbyists maybe hmm.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama isn't that ridiculous
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I put my premiums on credit cards. Now I owe $3k plus interest and late charges. Ain't exactly working as designed.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Can Congress expect 4 millions with STANDING to sue the US govt this year? Or do you open Medicare to us? We need.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama My minimum wage granddaughter was refused coverage. Reality check?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Because they don't want to be left on the hook to spend anymore when the additional government funding ends
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama oh I have also heard that the coverage of madicad is limited and useless too

@WhiteHouse FACT: #SinglePayer was best option; impossible to accomplish w/#GOP. FACT: #ACA rates w/no subsidies better than what I had
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Good job to all those states for standing up to big, oppressive government and those sorts of bullying tactics!
@tedalspach and yet their citizens are left to suffer because of their irrational fears.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Healthcare: people, when born physically, all citizens should be on medicare. That's it. Universal healthcare,
@WhiteHouse Fact: the ACA is a federal mandate, not a state mandate. if there is fault, it lies with you.
@WhiteHouse Fact:  Iran's nuclear stockpile has increased 20% while you said it was frozen.  explain!
