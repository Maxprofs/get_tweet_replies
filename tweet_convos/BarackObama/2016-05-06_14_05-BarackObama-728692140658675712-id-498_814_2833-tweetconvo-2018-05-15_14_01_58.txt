@BarackObama Trump. Still correct. At least it make sense while Republican Senate not doing their work electing Judge Merrick Garland
@PelhamYard_Suny it's not their job to elect him but to vet him, and when it was opposite democrats argued Senate shouldn't do it
@chirho1981 When Republican control the Senate, house of Congress. When Senate, Congress are dysfunctional.
@PelhamYard_Suny that tweet gave me cancer
@OFA  Jab tell them
@BarackObama so basically it's fair NOW but not when a republican is in office #liberallogic
@POTUS It is so sad that we even have to ask for a fair hearing. This should be given. USA was founded as a democratic country.
