@BarackObama Not true.  There are 92 million out of workforce.  So who is working?  Record poverty too. Incomes down. Debt record.
@GBigsAngle poverty/income/debt have been increasing since before we even knew who @BarackObama was. Your blame is misguided.
@Magdalena0113 @BarackObama Also, incomes have fallen under Obama due to his loss of full time jobs.  Obamacare is a self evident disaster.
@GBigsAngle recovery is a slow process that could be expedited if Republicans would stop killing every job/vet/wage bill @BarackObama
@Magdalena0113 @BarackObama You are repeating DNC talking points. 100m out of workforce and record poverty and homeless are not a recovery
@BarackObama @docrocktex26 And they have the nerve to say he doesn't do anything... he is trying to do some good.
@KimaKonfections @BarackObama Succeeding too.
@docrocktex26 @BarackObama Most of their attempts to derails his presidency are failing. I would have been told them to suck it if I was him
.@BarackObama Thank you President Obama. I appreciate and respect your leadership.
.@sherrijames @Magdalena0113 @BarackObama Does any1 consider what life would b like now had McCain/Palin won? We would be like Russia now.
@SouthernRock3 watch your mouth! that's not even allowed to mention hypothetically! @sherrijames @BarackObama
@BarackObama / Good for sure,  but wages are the worst in years. We are working harder making less than ever.
@KljKocer if you're concerned about wages, contact your Congressmen. @BarackObama
@Magdalena0113/ I have. Thank you.

@BarackObama and ZERO wage growth
“@yonimweiss: @BarackObama and ZERO wage growth” Contact your local Congressmen

@BarackObama with oil prices in free fall us will go into recession next yearwith big companies cut and layoff people
@BarackObama very nice. Now if we can address wage stagnation...?
“@Jelani64: @BarackObama very nice. Now if we can address wage stagnation...?” This Qvwould be more appropriate for Congress & Corporations
@Magdalena0113 @BarackObama I know but since they blame everything else on the Magical President I was hoping he could wave his sceptor &...
@BarackObama Democrats should have  campaigned on that during midterm election.
@BarackObama not because of you, but despite of you. 
You are the worst president since Carter and you know his legacy is.
