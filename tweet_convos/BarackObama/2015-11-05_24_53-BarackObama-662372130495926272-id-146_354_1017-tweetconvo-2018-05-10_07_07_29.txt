@RobinDotNet @BarackObama Yes they are moving, think most to Mexico where wages are cheaper
@ffajaz2 @BarackObama They act like they're streamlining their factories in the press releases. Not surprised they're offshoring more jobs.
@RobinDotNet Being forced out of US as cost very high with Unions and Fed Taxes cant keep it up and make money so go to cheap labor markets

@BarackObama @AktionDemograph ...was ein BULLSHIT.
@BarackObama lets add shower curtains and sheets to the list? 2 things NOT made in USA anymore. Imagine the jobs.
@BarackObama Why do foreigners get extended visas, not have to pay federal income tax, and the employers get to pay reduced payroll taxes?
@BarackObama If you want more Americans to have jobs, why are there so many incentives for companies to hire foreign workers?
@BarackObama You literally disgust me.
@barackobama Indeed!It's universal economics' truth!More American-made exports means more higher-paying jobs in the US!
