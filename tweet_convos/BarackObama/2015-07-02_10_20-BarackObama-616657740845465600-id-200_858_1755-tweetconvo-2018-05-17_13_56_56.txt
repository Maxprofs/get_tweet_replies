@BarackObama @FLGovScott @AGPamBondi
I was falsely accused of battering Deputy Coan & Geoghagan & resisting arrest w/violence after bn tased
@BarackObama @FLGovScott @AGPamBondi
I was tased seconds after drying my hands while using my own bathroom so clearly I had no intent2 harm.
@BarackObama @FLGovScott @AGPamBondi
Though Deputies Coan & Geoghagan were indeed impeached who knew an ALL WHITE jury could ignore evidence
@BarackObama @FLGovScott @AGPamBondi
In fact who knew public defendrs could refuse 2present substantial evidence showing an abuse of process
@BarackObama @FLGovScott @AGPamBondi
