@JohnnyTodd @BarackObama They are doing the job!  They are doing what they think is best for the country. Remember two sides to every story
@oclatham @BarackObama No, they're not. They won't even hold hearings.
@shotknockr The Constitution....
@shotknockr It says they are supposed to work with POTUS to appoint new Justice. Refusing to at all is the exact opposite
@shotknockr It says with the advise and consent.  The entire point is to get a new SCJ. This is literally against the Constitution.
@rbaker2136 @BarackObama nope
@BarackObama Mitch McConnell, willing to take fall for GOP obstruction of justice.   Don't let him. Vote the silent GOP senate out.
