@Everytown We can end much of the gun violence by tackling the severe mental issues plaguing this country.
unfortunately that is not true. Gun violence can be controlled only by getting Reid of guns
Good, someone with sense here. M.I. treatment is an issue, but it doesn't explain the rate of US shooting deaths.
People concentrate on mass shootings, when 99% of victims are domestic, neighbors, rage incidents, accidents.
Successful suicide attempts are much more frequent and likely with a firearm than almost any other method.
If someone wants to kill themselves, they'll find a way to do it. Gun or no gun. Guns aren't the problem.
Guns may not be THE problem, but they are A problem
The USA is a nation of uneducated, TV addicted, alcoholic, prescription pill poppers. Wuddya expect?
we going to put Hillary and maybe you in orange permanently.
69 ppl shot in Chicago over memorial weekend. Gun control capital of world. Any new ideas?
هلا
like our Muslim president do you?
yes
I thought so. I admire your honesty and confirmation.
@MatthewLeber @Iixxu11 @BarackObama
don't trust leftist BC in your heart u wish u could have Australian style confiscation. Who cares NRA says
As gun owners prefer Switzerland gun laws! Google it and educate yourself! #stillwaiting
I am gun owner and prefer no gun laws except 2nd amendment.
@Everytown we all Indians are with you to fight against this
@Everytown this is Obama's start to taking our 2nd Amendment
@Ez4u2say_Janis @Everytown Unfortunately U can't have it both ways. Eliminating gun violence at home while waging endless war.
@BitcoinBuddhist @BarackObama @Ez4u2say_Janis @Everytown
@cbdlaw u
@Everytown I am in agreement with back ground checks.
Stop bringing  TERRORIST!!  It is your will to feed the American people to TERRORIST!  YOU WELCOME KILLERS INTO OUR COUNTRY!
: I'm a Democrat like you, but growing up in Mexico, I do not believe in repealing the 2A will make us "safe".
@kyclarkejo @Everytown oh, boy. It just broke my heart to see the date on this RT. I love you for your light. 
I remind myself to breathe cuz this issue makes me so angry.I want open dialog w/ those that disagree,but I'm too mad for words
@BarackObama
@MiaGregerson33 @Everytown We should do Background Checks on Gun Manufacturers who schlep up to CapitalHill & bribe Politicians
Stop bringing  TERRORIST!!  It is your will to feed the American people to TERRORIST!  YOU WELCOME KILLERS INTO OUR COUNTRY!
@Everytown can tell Obama to do his job and send men  Into Chicago to take away those gangsters guns
@Everytown why should we stand with you. You're nothing but a liar. Now getting Obamacare to illegal immigrants.
Thanks for the reminder Barry all my AR15s will #WearOrange tomorrow @BarackObama @Radomysisky #2A @NRA
@M0L0NL4BE @BarackObama @Radomysisky @NRA

@Lg4Lg @BarackObama
#WearOrange
I think you should  give a medal to Miss and Mr Steven A Cohn for giving our military $275,000,000.00 . This is a big story
@Everytown just  say i love u
@Everytown 
yeah, take away our guns, so it will be easier to for you to become dictator Obozo the 1st of America...
@Everytown 
Orange is the color of the prison jumpsuits....you preparing them to wear it, huh?
@Everytown #CommonSenseGunLaws
#United States #PresidentObama
I dont think a color is louder than a shotgun. Arrest the criminals killing people instead of making videos. Simple
@Everytown
@denisohare way to go people try reading http://www.facebook.com/thefirstblackpresidentblues … Dave
@Everytown somebody better remind those gangs in Chicago to wear orange.
powerful video.  Thank you for being a great leader and standing up against gun violence.  #WearOrange #StopGunViolence #ucla
UNTIL we put religion and common sense back in our whole lives the madness will continue
#WakeUpAmerica gun violence is a deep issue #WearOrange is just the tip of the growing iceberg
Hilter approves this message.
@Everytown #WearOrange #PalmSprings
hope more leaders and people show their support to #WearOrange and help in ending this stigma
Singapore doesn't have gun violence. We ban gun ownership. The security needs of the many override individual wants.
as I #WearOrange I'm thinking a lot about all the toddlers and young kids who have lost their lives due to guns. Please help!
@Everytown. Would #HONOR them more by getting rid of the #KILLING-ZONES (oops I meant #GUN_FREE_ZONES).
 You stupid Lib-A-Tards
@Everytown @Bhupi3920
@Everytown For everyone trying to discredit gun control. Australia after Port Authur -> results speak for themselves.
@Everytown How bout wear Orange against Gangs? Or Bettet Mental Health Care programs? Tougher sentences for violent ppl?
Keep 100 million cars a year “OFF THE STREET” campaign http://exactcolors.com 
@Everytown Mr. President, you offer no solutions, just appologies.  Defend the Constitution and citizens.
@.@BarackObama @TheAmyBrenneman here I am in my orange shirt today! Stop gun violence!
@Everytown Let's start with your secret service shall we. If it's good enough for WeThe People, it's good enough for your fam
@Everytown https://www.vmbvoom.com/pitches/stop-co2-the-movie …
How about you ask to put pressure on congress to take care of our veterans?
@brendagaylern so it's fine is she got knifed to death in poverty? Or killed by drunk driver? Ban alcohol 74% of crimes related
Not as loud, but representative of your CRIMINAL, LAWLESS PRESIDENCY! @POTUS for Prison Orange! #never2late2impeach @gop
@brendagaylern violence happens before gun enters equations. Persons who will Suffer gun rights restrictions are #NRAGoodpeople
.@BarackObama What is the opposite of Orange? I'm wearing that, you soulless despot. #2A #GunRights @NRA @GunOwners @Guntalk
criminals do not follow laws.
@Everytown stop talking and do something. Your rhetoric won't save one life. Repair "broken windows."
@BarackObama
"If I had a son, he'd be wearing orange." Yeah, an orange jumpsuit. LMAO #WearOrange

What's the opposite of orange?
Oh wait, got it.  I'll be wearing black Tenifer.
@Donkey_Feed Obama has changed us a lot so get him out and don't replace him with another one!
Dear, Mr. President, please ban these tools of destruction from our community.
What color should we wear to show support for personal accountability?
<ochre>
@BarackObama

@Everytown Quit blaming guns dumba$$!

@Everytown fuck your communist propaganda
@Everytown cringe
@Everytown Chicago Hyde Park were Orange!!!
I wear Orange at least once a month
@Everytown there is no such thing as gun violence. Guns can't be violent if they are inanimate . Humans are violent
The problem is with how easy it is to get a gun. #WearOrange supporters should realize that.
Yeah, because there were no rampant murders until guns were invented in 13th century. #facepalm #smh
Done. MT @BarackObama Speak out against gun violence—#WearOrange tomorrow.
@DrSueDVM @BarackObama 
I will wear what I wish. Refuse to look like a pumpkin.
its called gang violence
Whataburger employees are ready af then
@IsaIbnOfficial Newsflash: wearing orange doesn't stop street thugs and lunatics from shooting people dead for no reason. 
@Everytown No thanks.  If I wear orange people won't think I'm against gun violence but just have bad fashion sense.
Go to work and focus on important issues Hussein.
really .. What the hell does wearing orange do? How abt sending national grd to Chicago? They can wear orange.

How many dead in gun free Chicago?  #replaceobama or  #keepupthefail
how do u condemn gun violence one week and lift a lethal weapons ban in a state with gun violence issues the other week? #ELI5

Sorry, @BarackObama, but #WearOrange clashes with the 2nd Amendment. cc; @POTUS @WhiteHouse
Speaking out against you helpng the rise of ISIS. Murdering Islamics committing genocide against Christians and you do nothing.
