@BarackObama infanticide and fetalcide are not private decisions but criminal activity.  #PlannedParenthood + #DNC = blood-money

@BarackObama 
Great thought Mr President!!
@BarackObama the government should also see that abortion is a form of murder, murderers are supposed to be thrown in jail or executed.
@BarackObama The government should not intrude on any decision made by law abiding citizens...firearm purchase, healthcare etc...
