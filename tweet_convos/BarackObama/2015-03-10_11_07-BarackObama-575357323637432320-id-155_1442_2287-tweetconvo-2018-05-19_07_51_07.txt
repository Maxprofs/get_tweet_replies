@BarackObama Offering "free" community college (aka tax-payer funded) would significantly decrease the value of education.

@BarackObama @AbdrhmanElkordy L'Amérique perd de la réputation académique face à la Chine, le Canada, l'Allemagne et la Corée du Sud
@maroc2013 @BarackObama I don't agree with you in this point
@AbdrhmanElkordy @BarackObama Les américains eux mêmes ont reconnu que leur système éducatif perd de poids et de valeur face à ces pays
@maroc2013 @BarackObama may be I don't know

@AbdrhmanElkordy @BarackObama il faut suivre ce qui se passe à l'intérieur de l'Amérique.
@maroc2013 @BarackObama ok
@BarackObama @AbdrhmanElkordy Les USA devraient  se consacrer davantage à ses affaires strictement internes comme l'éducation.
@maroc2013 @BarackObama sure
@BarackObama Mr.Yes help for future leaders.
@BarackObama higher ed without crippling debt is, sadly, reserved for the few. #realitycheck

@BarackObama presidente obama venezuela es un pays de paz y le presidente maduro lo a demotrado aqui no queremo guerra queremo paz para ven
@BarackObama Thats right. So lets build more schools & shut down the racist privatized prison system.
@BarackObama but it surely gives a President who Offends a friendly Nation but Refuses to declare ISIS/BokoHaram/LeT/HizB as Islamic Terror.
@BarackObama You're right, there are countries in America where higher education is free (Argentina) or considerably cheaper (Canada)
@BarackObama you believe wrong
Amen!"@BarackObama: "I believe America is not a place where higher education is a privilege reserved for the few." —President Obama
@BarackObama it's free here in Scotland, I wouldn't have my degree otherwise
@BarackObama please talk AZ joke of a Governor!!
@BarackObama I really wish education and student loans had been your focus earlier before the upper and lower houses of "no" came in place.
@BarackObama no college dreams are Dreams Deferred due to a lack of funding. We post scholarship opportunities daily. B-Forc! Nation shares

@BarackObama not true. AZ governor cut millions of dollars to universities. How does that help?? Soon only rich people can go to college.
@BarackObama then for the love of God figure out how to make them lower the price. Even state schools are nearly $20k a year!
@BarackObama but what have you done in two terms to change this especially in the projects??
@BarackObama So does this make the hard working manual labor folks less important? The ones that keep the lights on and country running????
@BarackObama But whose job is it to pay for their college? Not the American taxpayer. #LifeLibertyandthePURSUITofHappiness

@BarackObama Congratulations  Mr . president  Barack Obama

@BarackObama Yeah. Anyone can accumulate mounds of student loan debt, America doesn't discriminate!
@BarackObama The internal structure of many universities are still geared that way...
.@BarackObama if only the actual system reflected that belief.
@BarackObama In Venezuela It does...
@BarackObama 
But we spend the next 30 year's struggling to pay off student loans.
@_karma_is_real_ @BarackObama Its weird but TRUE!! Same here in India!!
@BarackObama President Obama. America goes from Canada to Argentina. It's not only your country
.@BarackObama y'all got anymore of them fafsa deals?
@BarackObama how many truck drivers' sons are in Harvard?
@BarackObama that's because under your administration any student can build up as much unforgivable debt as is humanly possible to get one
