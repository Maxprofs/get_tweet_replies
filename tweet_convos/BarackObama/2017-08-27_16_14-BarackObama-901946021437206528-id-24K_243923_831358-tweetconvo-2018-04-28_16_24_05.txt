You have half the world fooled, Barry ... but then charisma and charm are Lucifer's tools. Shame on you. Soon you and your minions will pray for mountains to fall on you. Thinking you are above reproach is a major mistake.
ظممنممنمن
your nimble leadership lives on
Why keep giving to Red Cross they make so much money n keep it.

Hey, can i ask you a question, that your name in your childhood is Barry Obama?
Im a victim of my human rights, civils, politics, authority property, my children's kidnapping victims are, my family its victim of your privacy, space, toughs and movements, we need freedom and be Rescued, I'm the Commander in Chief, but I don't care. I'm right. I'm death now.

Reklamı bırak kendini adam yerine koymayıda bırak... Kürtler yem yapıyordunuz yaptın halada yapıyorsunuz! Dont thank ...THİNK
Good Lord, you are so missed.
Really?
Thank You President Obama for your kind words 
Appreciate how you tweet ways to be helpful, rather than claim credit for the Best Disaster! Let's help those hardworking first responders.
Presidential.
Thanks Mr. President.  YOU truly are the epitome of an American President.

@realDonaldTrump this is how you responded to a crisis as a leader! #Eclipse

Thank you MR. PRESIDENT, you're sorely missed!! God Bless you!!!
Thank you for continuing to be a leader for the American people.
Come back
Thank you so much President Obama for continuing to lead this nation and help out while the real president disappoints on many levels
You will go down in history as not only a great president but a great human being, father and husband
Eccl. 10:2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. HOLY BIBLE  NIV
No need to quote the Bible Trump doesn't even read it so your point is pretty much mute
#TrumpResign we need many prayers!
That is what a president tweets like, thank you Mr. President

Thank you for your continued support for our nation when the current president is disappointing
Thank you President Obama you are truly the best President ever.  America is headed for an iceberg we need you to right the ship.
Thank you Mr. President.
Thank you President Obama. Your voice is a comfort in this troubled time. Love.
I miss youplease come back they didn't know what they were talking about HELP
@BarackObama you sir are a great man and were the best president our country has ever had. Thank you.
We miss you Mr. President.
@RedCross Thank You, Mr. President
Thank you Mr. President!!!! 
Now this is what a President tweets.  Not the other guy
And that's what a president does. Calm and authoritative. Please call @realDonaldTrump to help him. @realDonaldTrump please accept help.
Oh Good Lord people stop bowing....I WILL NEVER VOTE DEMOCRAT AGAIN! The hate is sickening.
We miss you, sir.

Thanks Obama! You can say it...you put some things in place for situations like this and going down a checklist to undo u only hurts the ppl
Thank you President Obama for your selfless words. We miss you leading our country.
WE LOVE YOU MR PRESIDENT
Pathetic
I don't think calling yourself pathetic is healthy
Thank you Mr.President
Thank you for focusing on people's needs and how we all can help our neighbors snd fellow citizens.
Will you please get lost.  Where were you when Katrina hit, oh right, playing golf. Now you want to play president. NEVER again
He was in Illinois. Doing his job as State SENATOR. George W. Bush was #POTUS at the time. Please go read a history book.
Obama was not a State Senator in 2005. He was a U.S. Senator. If you're going to troll a Trumpster, please do it accurately.
Fair point. Thank you for the correction.

What was Obama doing during Katrina? He was actually at the Astrodome helping out and wasn't even goddamn president yet. 
What was Obama doing during the Baton rouge flood, oh wait, playing golf I forgot... while Trump rushed right over to help.

Oh, look at that! He is looking at the actual damage, not visiting a town away from the damage. What a concept!
@RedCrossBayArea how r u doing
How much did you donate? How much did HRC donate? @realDonaldTrump donated.

@RedCross Thank you sirji
thanks u sir
What an ignorant, tasteless tweet.
the hell is wrong with you, Thomas?
So you go after the FORMER President while he's trying to help people in need? Jesus man, get a grip.
The current President tweeted out a book rec while Texas was getting torn up. Did you tweet at him?
You could tell Hill to give the money she took from Haiti and you could ask Iran for the Money you took from us, that would fix everything
Hello
go away. We have a President.
You're NO American!

Obama thanks for your love and compassion through it all. WE  you Obama! 
There are many of us that still love you and do MISS you as POTUS.
your like a hemroid always up my Presidents ass.
Thank you for sharing the link!
I am granting access for Hillary to access to my "guest" wifi, show her the way, so we can finally have our 1st female president... -star
Will you be providing $65,000 of pizza/dogs for the evacuees? Same channels is fine.

We miss you and Michelle more than words can say.
Don't pretend to care now, u could care less about police officers getting killed, or about US Amercans, those $150 billion+ your sorry....
DO NOT DONATE to the @RedCross. Got billions for Haiti relief and built just 6 homes. Corrupt organization. Probably why Obama endorses it.
Still waiting....how much money have you given to Texas?  Answer please.....$______________________out of your wallet?
Man that guy stinks
Red cross is a sham.
Gay man married to a tranny! 
Maybe you could donate part of that $60 million dollar book deal to victims of hurricane Harvey? That's what privileged Americans do!
Yes, please get lost
Best President ever.
Really
Xin chào ngài obama
You want us to believe DACA is about dreamers.These people burn our flag, spit on us citizens. They don't  USA but to u they're voters.
go away
You sir are a great man!  Thanks for giving your life to civic endeavors!  You are sorely missed!  You and your entire family!  
1 way to help is to stand out of the way of our president Another is to submit new budget that doesnt support you as the only American alive
Are you watching this President,  he's really interacting with all the people.
Hahahah what about people in burma...you can only help those people who are profitable to you.
I wish you were still in office. We miss you, Michelle & the girls terribly.
did you pledge $1M of your own money to any relief effort?
But the fact in all this is that u @BarackObama can never b a true American U r the only Presi in hist2have had such Anti-American policies
Good morning
And that ladies & gents is CLASS
Thank you  Mr President
Or they could just go play golf like you did.
Houston could sure use that 1 billion dollars you sent to Iran
so how much have you donated to relief efforts in Texas. pony up some of the money your fines provided that you sent to pals. POTUS stopped.
You were a divider, not a President! You hate this country, quit pretending! #MAGA
So how long did the oligarchs groom you? Your a cruel hoax! Who preyed on the hearts of millions of people. And by the way, America wins!
so... the world is scared. can you like, become president of europe or something?
DACA. Bye bye
I love the most selfless such as Mr Obama
#FirstResponders are who #SaveLives. #Support #Lead #Mentor #OneGlobalEmergencyResponseNetwork 2 provide #EmergencyResponse 2 #SaveLives
You also showed us patience and CLASS. I'm so proud to be from Hawaii where you were born.
You are grate leader sir
Pero es muy lamentable lo que esta ocurriendo en mexico
Hi
@RedCross      Sorry for the hurricane Harvey.
Tell your friends in Palestine we want back that $221MM you secretly gave them before leaving office.  Flood victims can use it now!
Thank you....
That money you gave to Iran would have come in handy, huh??
 Missing you all the way form Norway!
come back to be our president
President Barack Obama.
And thank YOU for stepping up where your "successor" has failed so miserably.
You are the biggest insult America has had to endure.
All those American haters following Obama
Thank you so much President, for spreading the word....these dear people need all the help they can get..
Coe barack, paaaarca, segue eu ai brodi

He rolls his sleeves up ,nails the issues and encompasses all without a hint of ego.He transcends political divide-arguably a true statesman
We want you back. Trump is really messing things up.
Nope. The Red Cross did nothing to help my sister and her disabled husband.  You would support them. So glad your gone. Bye Felisha


Ur great sir
.
Red Cross is a corrupted organization and needs to be investigated.


you are the best.
Thank you & Michelle's for a pure heart.
Thanks
Obama was a prejudiced,Muslim inclination , economically ignorant, a disgrace to American excellence. Hurt the USA many ways Horrible,danger
Praying for DACA! While they advocate to pray for one group of people while activity kicking another group out of the country!Heartbreaking!
АБАМКА АБИЗЯНКА
Thank u
No sé qué actualizar la dirección información hy xn
We wish you were back, your so better than Donald Trump 
Do your research on who you donate to first. Red Cross is hardly giving anything to help. Even what they are they're making it difficult
I think you need to put a stop to all this negativity and tell your followers to give our President chance to do his job..America Unite!
Do your kids know you're not an American?
thank u president Obama

Anyway to get that 150 billion back from iran
...Luv U but I Don't Do #RedCross 
What a complete looser. Why weren't you down there if you care so much. You sicken me
BRO no no no redcross doesn't do shit TELL PEOPLE TO DONATE TO LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. PET SHELTERS ETC
Why is President still in your bio?
