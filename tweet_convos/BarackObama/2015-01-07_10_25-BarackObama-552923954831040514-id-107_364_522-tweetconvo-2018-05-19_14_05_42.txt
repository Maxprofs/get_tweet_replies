@WhiteHouse I like how you environmentalists buy the crap. Look up charles manson. He runs a website devoted to environmental issues.

@WhiteHouse
After Obama took over Chrysler in dictator fashion, it's now completely foreign-owned.
@RufusKings1776 @WhiteHouse That happening is a matter of business not Obama's fault. Blame GOP ATTACKING S.S., unemployment ins., unions!!!
@AD1stro @WhiteHouse What does Social Security and GOP have to do with Obama taking Chrysler and it being owned by Italy? You feeling okay?
