“@BarackObama: Investing in renewable energy helps fight climate change—and creates jobs. #ActOnClimate ”
@BarackObama sounds like a good plan to me!!!
@BarackObama it will cost a fortune, cause rates to skyrocket, inefficient and undependable when there's no wind or sun but you continue....
@BarackObama You can't fight climate change when it's not man made. Only solar intensity is responsible. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama True sir
@BarackObama why can't we adopt this system ?
@BarackObama thank you!
@BarackObama we also need more money in NASA to get those "innovations" that were mentioned. Suggestions for who comes next?

@BarackObama Great issue President Obama, it's time for the bipartisum to come to an end, YOU ARE STILL HERE we know right from wrong
@BarackObama Investing in renewable energy means also give the planet endangered by the use of fossil sources a chance for the future.
@BarackObama how about you make it mandatory to include solar paneling n all new construction.Building permits must be changed to include it
@BarackObama speaking of inappropriate timing. Shouldn't you be addressing issues around stock market/ economy today?#wakeupamerica
@BarackObama Claro que si así pensaran todos nuestro mundo cambiaria
@BarackObama  oil and coal at record production levels in USA. It takes a shit load of coal to make these useless wind mills.
@BarackObama thank you
@BarackObama We also need more nuclear energy. It is the lowest carbon way to generate electricity, and creates lots of jobs.
@BarackObama Bird murderer.
@BarackObama not in Sweden who were leaders in this area. They shifting their focus to other renewables. This old news. Who is advising you?
@BarackObama Leave this task to someone more trustworthy, before you botch this up too.
@BarackObama repairs of wind equipment getting too expensive. Sweden not support wind as renewable energy. Too costly repairs
@BarackObama For all that's available, I wish nothing won't be fake! Just negative in streets doesn't stop all energy or employments!
@BarackObama
 Duma's last 24 doctors
