@BarackObama That's true, but the dialogue needs to change to include everyone, not just women.
@rdube @BarackObama no it doesn't, because that is not what the convorsation is about
@Sophiechick14 @BarackObama Therein lies the problem.
@rdube no, because not all conversations have to include men
@Sophiechick14 Ones about gender equality probably should, unless you prefer just preaching to the choir. That's your prerogative.
