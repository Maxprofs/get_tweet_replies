@BarackObama I never doubted @BarackObama @POTUS 4 a moment. Once again, I will DEFEAT the #GOP, who SHUT-DOWN R USA
@BarackObama Then why have insurance premiums gone up and benefits been reduced? Why are less employers able to offer family coverage?!?!
@BarackObama I'm so excited about the verdict! Thank you Mr. President for standing up for the people.#ACAWorks
@BarackObama It works for me!  When I lost my coverage at work, I was then denied due to pre-existing conditions. ACA provided a lifeline.
@BarackObama #educate #america #reschedule #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis patients deserve more than just suffering
@BarackObama As with nearly everything else, it depends on whose perspective you see things through. Insurance is definitely worse for me.
@BarackObama For whom? Certainly not the hard working middle class FAMILIES!!!! Higher premiums, less coverage and high co-pays.
@BarackObama you are living in a fantasy world.
@BarackObama  $2500-$5000 deductibles are unusable policies! It is cheaper to pay out of pocket!
@BarackObama
