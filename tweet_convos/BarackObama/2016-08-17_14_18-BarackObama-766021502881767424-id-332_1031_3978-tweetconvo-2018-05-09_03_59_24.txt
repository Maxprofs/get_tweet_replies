@nytimes too bad this will put many truckers out of business.
your a stain that America needs to be rid of #truth
Chris is so messed up.  What's wrong with you.  America is in good shape, it is the republicans who messed it up
you believe what you want, I've seen first hand Obama admin cost this country thousands of jobs
Where we live, we have tons of jobs available, from entry level to college level jobs.  Guess California is gold
where we live we got to stand together, make sure the fed gv don't take things away, we never will let em take..
Haahaa, now you're making me laugh.
We miss you so much.  Michele could run for POTUS and you could be First Gentleman.  I would vote for you two again.
THATS GOOD1 SIR, THIS WILL DRASTICALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF C EMISSION
@nytimes the world scarface I didn't wrote galigula movie enjoy
@Ram24793354  jdjjdjdjsjjssjsjd
@nytimes That will just increase the truck prices an up food prices. Regulations for cars have sharply increased prices.
thank you for another attempt to destroy our business with more regulations.
Hillary will say anything to get elected. both are incapable of the truth.  Liars.
too bad the manufactures can't keep up costing trucking companies millions and costs passed to Americans on all goods
Add to that huge subsidies for those companies that switch 100% of their trucks to greener ones. Even more for electric trucks
@nytimes @DeanLeh
@APPropst Will these new standards for emissions be the first of many to help lead the US to a more efficient society?
Many cars now cost what you would pay for a singlewide mibile home and even a double wide one. Do I want the car or the home?
@nytimes and he's going to destroy the trucking industry as well. Great job, says nobody!!!!
@nytimes and run thousands of businesses in the toilet !
wow very nice rood https://goo.gl/MlPgN2

all of my grandparents were life long democrats and working class people. Now in the election of 2016 they will be voting TRUMP
my grandpa started driving semis at 21 in 1960. Drove until he was 74. If he was still alive he would never vote for Hillary.
should know that most major cities in the USA have only 3 days worth of food in the stores and gas at the pumps. Like Chicago.
You don't want a carbon pollution, but where's the humanity of this!!!!!
as someone who has been part of the trucking industry for a long time these new laws will cause small companies to go under.
putting more regulation on the trucking industry you will/are losing the working class democrats that are truckers.
you should understand that more regulation on the trucking industry will cause the price of goods in the stores to go up.
Thank you, President Obama. #GOAT
