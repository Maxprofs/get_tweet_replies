@GartonJc 
Ta Jules. After my dad´s heart attack, he had to pay $25 dollars a pill for 3x a day. His insurance didn´t cover it. x

@BarackObama your smoking something, that health care system is a mess
@BarackObama  Mr. president the insurance cost is to high for working families, it hunt over 120%
@BarackObama We are delighted except for the outrageous cost of it in MA, especialy for retired teachers like myself!!!
@BarackObama Well done Mr President. A milestone to be proud of Indeed. Thumbs up
@BarackObama Was the killing of more than a million people necessary for a failed regime change in Syria??
@BarackObama GOOD! I hope the ACA won't be banned!
@BarackObama. Right like ISIS is a JV team and you can keep your Doctor. BS
@BarackObama Bullshit. Go back to Cuba.
@BarackObama sure there are less people uninsured BUT at what cost #URAFUCKINGDUMBASS
@BarackObama what about the people struggling below 150% poverty line in states with pre-obamacare Medicaid rules still in place
@BarackObama I believe 41 %...
@jshughes199 @BarackObama Trump will make these illegal Mexicans go to work and stop exploring the Americans who work hard!
@BarackObama 
How about the insanely high deductibles?  No comment?  #shocked
@BarackObama affordable for who because I can't afford Healthcare
@BarackObama Barack Obama is best president of US and  the worlds leader indeed, and his personality is very unique between politicians
@BarackObama I'm sure the health insurance industry loves it.  #unaffordablecareact.  #risingpremiums.
@BarackObama My premium raised 33% over 2015  1/3 of my ss.
@BarackObama http://www.tbc.co.kr/tbc_news/n14_newsview.html?p_no=160229020 …
@BarackObama No it isn't, it just means that now my health is now gambled upon by the lowest bidder instead of the highest. Truthfully....
@BarackObama ..my health is not a for profit commodity. There was a time when doctors became doctors to help people, now its to get rich....
@BarackObama No President Obama. We are not stonger. I am paying higher prices and for less choices and coverage under your ACT. Disgraceful
@BarackObama Naatuma( Good work done)
@BarackObama Yeah if you are rich enough to actually buy health care. But for those who are unable to buy gets a nasty tax hit.
@BarackObama you're knowingly taking steps to socialize the country it's a joke you were elected twice
@BarackObama Those who disagree haven't visited ALL their constituencies. Please keep supporting us, American President Obama!
@BarackObama most expensive insurance..... Ever
@BarackObama you'd be missed president Barack Obama
@BarackObama well done mr. President
@BarackObama insurance they can't use because to expensive-not sure anyone is better off
@BarackObama Thank you so much Prez
@BarackObama Mr. President America daase!
@BarackObama THANKS MR PRESIDENT#
@BarackObama
@BarackObama you what you can for the sake of your people but what about the mankind brothers and sisters do they have that insurance
@BarackObama Well Done Mr. Obama
@BarackObama When we are about each other we wish each one of us health.
@BarackObama  .   Mr. President what you did to eliminate the head of Isis in Syria was amazing.   Thank you.@JollesPatricia
@BarackObama fabulious
@BarackObama thanks Obama
@BarackObama Too bad the price of insurance is so high can't afford drs/meds. Thanks, now I pay taxes on insurance.
@BarackObama might be covered but the deductible is outrageous. Might as well not have insurance
@BarackObama #ignorancemakesmeangry just because you publish something repeatedly does not make it true.
@BarackObama you forgot to include highest premiums ever for my family and cancellation of my old, much cheaper policy.
@BarackObama great job
@BarackObama is it affordable when you are 27 pay $227 per month $6000 deductible no drug card and make $29000 with $500 month student loan?
@paxsons I'm not a fan of @POTUS You're bitter because you're shitty life didn't turn out how you'd hoped! #paybackthemoney
@BarackObama u provide a terrible service for an unreasonable price. Thats why u had to have a law to fore ppl to buy or be finedChickenshit
@BarackObama 1/20/17 can't wait
@BarackObama Sure they're covered. With a shitty plan, at outrageous premiums. Well on our way to one payer Healthcare. Worst president ever
@BarackObama with high ass co pays
@BarackObama Obama is ridiculous
@BarackObama thank you my autistic kids are now covered otherwise they would be rejected for pre existing conditions.
@BarackObama great job of you
@BarackObama i dont need health Insurance, im healthy why do i have to get penalized on my tax return? Thats illegal
@BarackObama The affordable care act is just more tax for those of us that work.  you are robbing the working class
@BarackObama my health care costs doubled... pl send me a CHECK!
@BarackObama what about the skyrocketing rates? It's easy to say more are insured because most are after freebies, nice job
@BarackObama ozn yaxwsan bele?
@BarackObama Evidence is clear, American do want health insurance. Time for Republicans to accept the situation & support all aspects of act
@BarackObama most of people's are covered under aca great changes....
@BarackObama because you forced people to buy even if they can't afford it. If not you get a fine. Thank Adolf
@BarackObama If only I didn't make $10,000 less than 10 years ago because of it, I would say . A teacher with 4 jobs=no time for my family
@BarackObama Team, adjust your image size for your tweet posts. #digitalmarketing #marketing
@BarackObama fuck trump!
@BarackObama after President Johnson in 60s this is the next game changer

@BarackObama largest premiums ever, check; less coverage, check; you can't keep your doctor, check; less money on my check, check!
@BarackObama Awesome!!!!
@BarackObama 20 MillionAmericans Covers with Health Insurance That'sjust so Wonderful it's soHardtomake iit withoutHealthInsurance!@rihanna
@BarackObama It's an "act" alright & anything but AFFORDABLE!!
@BarackObama I personally know of  a single mom making less than $27k a year with a teen son...no insurance help and no Medicaid..how awful!
@BarackObama thanks for your hard work!
@BarackObama liar. Premiums are skyrocketing. People are cheating on what their adjusted gross income is to get the subsidies.
@BarackObama  $1000 for a handicapped child for MediCal is horrible.  Thanks for NOTHING!
@BarackObama There's a possibility Donald Trump might take over after this man. How? Why America, why? #Election2016
@BarackObama I'm so proud of you I could burst. You have been an excellent president. Thank you and God bless you and the family.
@BarackObama yet some of us are still not covered as the state we live in did not accept or expand Medicaid. Paying the penalty is cheaper
@BarackObama admiro lo impecable y caballero tiene ese toque casi perfecto lo admiro y es muy atractivo éxitos Dios lo bendiga y my family
@BarackObama More Bunk from the Traitor in chief!
@BarackObama Very good President!
@BarackObama

@BarackObama
I can't afford the healthcare's rising premiums on my 2 part-time salaries so IRS says I need to pay them.
Stronger USA?
@BarackObama how much longer can it be sustained with the current Tax rates?
@BarackObama At what price and who is gonna pay for it????????????
@BarackObama You've done incredible work while in office despite the resistance. Fantastic job, Mr. President. Cheers!

@BarackObama 
Average employee increase $700 month.

@BarackObama h
@BarackObama I'm a physician in an underserved community within LA county and 50% are uninsured.
@BarackObama How many are still uninsured?  How many lost their insurance first, then regained an exchange plan?
@BarackObama Neat moves on the TANGO Mr. President, shows them that America is human after all
@BarackObama Still healthcare got more expensive for the middle class.  Obamacare also not affordable for small businesses.
@BarackObama this is great stuff but I wish it were affordable. 
@BarackObama Americans were killed in Brussels...wanna catch a ball game? #WorstPresidentEver
@BarackObama only problem is, hardly anyone accepts the insurance. Oh, and the insurance doesn't cover everything. I get huge bills. #fail
@BarackObama If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor LIE. Your premiums will not go up LIE.
@BarackObama Bravooooooo Mr President
