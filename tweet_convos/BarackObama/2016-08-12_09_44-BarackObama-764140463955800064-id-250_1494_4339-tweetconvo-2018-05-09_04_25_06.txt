want equality? you should eliminate advantages to female &minority businesses, affirmative action, &minority majority districts
If we're all equal, why do you vacation and golf more than the rest of us and on OUR dime?!

'All More Free!!
Sorry Mr. President, I disagree. In N.A. 21st century feminism isn't bout equality but bout replacing 1 boss w. another boss.
yes as w any group there is a handful of people who distort our goal to the public but please do not get caught on them
But equality is the last thing democrats actually want.
everyone has a right to live free from abuse and torture and a right over his/her own life.
I need my life. I have plans for it. I need to be afforded the opportunity to live it just like everyone else.
no idiot that's what 20th century feminism was about today it's about female supremacy.

Equality & capitalism are the same. Neither takes anything away from anyone else. Doesn't impinge on freedom or right of others

that's the public face of feminism. As with any "ism" the people that run it now have drastically diverged from that goal.
@FarnellMusic amusing, since you, the Clintons, and the elite 1% are obviously MORE equal than the rest of us. #AboveTheLaw
sure it mean destroying what folks built to give to looser takers
and dear sir, even world does not run on queueing theory
I fully support your words....
انما  حمق الزعماء نتاجه صفر من الأخلاق والأفلاس من الإنسانية
Thanks for all you have done with integrity and thoughtfulness measured out equally to all. Appreciate the man U have shown us.
I want my life. I have invested a lot in it. It is very meaningful to me. I am no less than Michelle, Malia and Sasha.
OBMはいっ！OBMはいっ！BMIじゃないよ？オ！バ！マ！

Absolutely 
@realDonaldTrump Everybody IS equal, it's just that some, like Hillary are more equal than others. You're as corrupt as she.
Equality!
A great way to put it, Mr. President!
Mr. President do some things for Haiti!
you clearly haven't been paying attention to the 21st century feminist movement, Mr. President.
True! Equality is to know the esteem that each person should have.
So true!  We have two female physicians in our family and working on our third!
and terorrist gulen 
Neither is the people of our country having zero say while you bigs control it all. It's ridiculous, Sir. Constitution.
We literally have nobody to vote for. The candidates that are honest and have good vision have no chance. Wtf, Mr. President.

The problem is too many don't want equal they want preferential. Equality means the same, not anyone getting more than another.
How about applying this to the People of All nations?
Amen

Right on, perhaps GMO foods will give the guys a GMO womb :)
Just keep the labels off so guys who don't care to have one get it too. The gals will get the requisite GMO apparatus :) LOL
Don't take this the wrong way but most people won't know the meaning of "zero-sum game".
the way white boys carry on you'd think we were condemning them to live like PoC in the 50s
you don't even look after your own people and you talk about equality.
im not american citizen. but GOD gives you a discernment  to choose a Good leader.Jesus love us and bless this country.
