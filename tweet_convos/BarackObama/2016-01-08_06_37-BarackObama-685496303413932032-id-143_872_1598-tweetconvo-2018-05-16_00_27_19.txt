@WhiteHouse All the more reason to elect a Democrat back into the White House this year so the recovery can continue.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama For long time unemployed, those 40+ yrs old will have great challenge securing employment even if they have skills.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama It seems that those on long term entitlements deliberately refused to work bec they're enslaved by them@ least on
@WhiteHouse the numbers don't lie. @POTUS is one of the most successful presidents of Modern Day history. Period.

@POTUS #Barackonomics @WhiteHouse
@whitehouse we all biafra youth are jobless In nigeria free-biafra
@WhiteHouse why didn't you mention that it's the lowest % of Americans working in 40 years!
@WhiteHouse Medicaid and welfare numbers go up. The more programs you start to get people out of the "unemployed" column-the better you look
@WhiteHouse Can you put a chart like this for the murderer GW Bush for comparison?
@WhiteHouse very good M.Barack
@WhiteHouse This when those assholes say it is a lie
@whitehouse
@WhiteHouse Most are min wage jobs and less than 40 hours weeks, that is not what we want and is a total failure of the White House

@WhiteHouse @intlspectator 
BREAKING: US economy has added 292,000 jobs as unemployment rate remains at 5%
Congrats...
@WhiteHouse Then why a record number unemployed?
@WhiteHouse that's a drop in the bucket with 350 million people in the USA and almost a quarter of them not working
@WhiteHouse Part time jobs flipping burgers and cleaning offices is the great recovery?
@WhiteHouse Ever notice GOP voters no longer have "fiscal conservative" on their profiles or in their dialogue anymore? They know.  #tcot
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Actually, if it's by the numbers.  Full-time jobs have decreased. People having to get multiple part-time jobs instead.
@WhiteHouse yes since Bill Clinton.  America is Great!
@whitehouse DRUDGE_REPORT: 94,103,000 Not in Labor Force...

@ITTRP @POTUS don't know what la la land you live. You seem to have forgotten the 8% unemployment that POTUS inherited. Bamboozled, really??
@hasina_6 When Obama and his @TheDemocrats peers took majority control of D.C. on 1/3/2007,
Unemployment was 4.4%
