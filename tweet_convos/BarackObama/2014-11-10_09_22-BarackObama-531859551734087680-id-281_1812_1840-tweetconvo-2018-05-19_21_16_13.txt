@BarackObama @FCC people are tired of the over regulations,  prices will go up quality will go down.
@rosesindew @BarackObama @FCC Prices gone up yet, since inception? Has technology suffered w an open internet? RESOUNDING NO.#NetNeurality
@BarackObama @FCC. #NetNeutrality should be protected, because who doesn't want the internet to be free for everyone.
@atalyssaneace25 Can't imagine the repercussions among the public if we had to pay for Internet. It's taking away an invaluable info source.
“@BarackObama: President Obama is urging the @FCC to keep the internet open and free. http://ofa.bo/i1U0  #NetNeutrality” #important
Why can @BarackObama decree what the DOJ will do but only urge the FCC? Can we get some consistency in our temporary despotism?
@davidcnswanson @BarackObama Because the FCC is an independent government organisation. The DOJ is not.
@psycho_202 @BarackObama Do you have a list of which agencies are independent and why?
@davidcnswanson @BarackObama A quick Google search gives me this list: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_agencies_of_the_United_States_government …
As to "why", I am unable to give an answer.
@BarackObama @FCC This is important.. Not touching our free market, advancing in Technology.. KEEP OUT OBAMA..
.@BarackObama @FCC Placing the internet under gov't control the same time the Dems are trying to decimate the first amendment. Great idea.
@BarackObama @FCC Agreed. Lets not just keep the internet open but the country as well for oil pumped from our Canada through YOUR land?
Gasp! Trying to shove net neutrality down our throats! RT @BarackObama President Obama is urging the @FCC to keep the internet open and free

@BarackObama @FCC If the FCC and obama make internet policy decisions (just like our healthcare) then how exactly will it be open and free?
