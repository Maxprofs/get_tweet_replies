Vote on a judge nominated by a man who's repeatedly crapped on the very Constitution he'd sworn to protect? I think not.
You will indeed be sent to the back of the queue - 8 years and so little results.

What we have here, is a failure to communicate. What is need is one language everyone understands and a Constitution read well.
