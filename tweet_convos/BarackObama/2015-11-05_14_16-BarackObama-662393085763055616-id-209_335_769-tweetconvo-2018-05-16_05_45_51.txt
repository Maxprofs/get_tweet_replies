@BarackObama it also threatens national sovereignty, giving more power to international corporations, #TPP says they are above the law.
@BarackObama How about higher costs, layoffs in America, and higher pharmo prices?
#RejectheDeal

Traitor 

@BarackObama
@barackobama Just like the ACA would bring insurance to everyone.  It has been a boost to the insurance industry.
@BarackObama what about the ability for multinational corporations to sue the govt for hurting their bottom line-esp. enviro regs? #StopTPP
@barackobama Nonsense.  It opens the door for more American jobs to be sent over to southwest Asia that will only pay pennies per hour.
@BarackObama so basically  'Merica is ripping all countries off giving nothing in return...?  'Merica is a true "Obama-Nation! "
@BarackObama @BernieSanders knows this. @SenWarren knows this and any who has lost a job since the 1990's knows this.
@BarackObama you're a good man but you are wrong on trade
@BarackObama we can't even afford American made products that's we we have to use the cheap labor elsewhere.
@BarackObama and it will cost millions of jobs just like nafta. When we make products they can't afford then we lose.
. @BarackObama how many manufacturing jobs do we have compared to them? Less then 10% i bet
@BarackObama Başkan, Manhattan' da boş arazi varsa, arel bi kampüs açsın oralarda. Otoban manzarası seyretmeye bıktım yemin ediyorum. Öptüm.

@BarackObama TPP - Good for the USA, but screw the rest of the world.
@BarackObama Any 1way "Trade" W #CheapLabor Countries that can't afford US Goods Is BAD for #USManufacturing #UnionJobs .. IS #1% #USselloff
