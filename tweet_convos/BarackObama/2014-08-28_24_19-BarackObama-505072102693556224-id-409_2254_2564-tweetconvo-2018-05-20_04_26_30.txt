@BarackObama perhaps it IS time to close the pay gap, but the right way to do so is to encourage more women to study STEM in college.

@BarackObama yes men and women are the same. No one have any Advantage with another
@BarackObama It is justified if women work less than men or they work in less responsible position than men, I hope it is not otherwise.
@BarackObama  vai super obama
@barackobama Just can't help creating divisive, distracting issues while he weakens the USA and the world burns.
@BarackObama if women expect the same pay I expect the same work out of them no more of this I'm a woman and can't pick this up its to heavy
“@BarackObama: It's time to close the pay gap between men and women.” in a way #jeroenpauw is right about women.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama It is time to close the gap between educating our minds and educating our brains. We educate our minds & miseducate our brains.

@BarackObama porfavor se?or presidente ayudeme con ese prestamo para poder conprarme una casa para estar junto con mifamilia se leahradese
@BarackObama What about the pay gap in your own administration?   Oh yeah, that's right, we're not supposed to question Der Fuerher!
@BarackObama @LUpthegrove Unless you stand up and join a Union, (preferably the Teamsters), even Democrats are loath to say this.
@BarackObama  Where's the parity of pay Barack?  Has Michelle been on to you about it?
@BarackObama women should be work harder
@BarackObama The reason to the result may be much more complicated than discrimination. To close it, can anyone tell us what is the reason?

@BarackObama Is that why he wore that suit?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Is the gender gap in prisons caused by the same thing causing the gender gap in wages? Where else is there a gender gap?
@BarackObama, commonsense just does'nt get around to most folks today's why not like Black
Officers police black people.God be with you.
@BarackObama  and let it begin in your house The Whitehouse that is!
@BarackObama How exactly? Is there any idea of what's really causing this? Maybe then we can fix it.
@BarackObama What would this graph look like if the population was divided into those who do and those who don't have children? Not gender.
@BarackObama Maybe women need to get better paying jobs and work the same number of days and hours as men then they would be making more
@BarackObama let the real Barack talk. Cause we all know he doesn't give a shit about the pay gap.
@BarackObama ouais

@BarackObama @blueocean5454 so start paying the women on your staff the same as the men....
@BarackObama really the time is now...there's no other better time.
@BarackObama @shreesters The gender pay gap is a myth that has been debunked time and time again, even by the OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ITSELF
@_wapaa_ @BarackObama you're wrongggg...check your facts sir. Literally just type it in
@shreesters WSJ: http://on.wsj.com/1vTxj6v 
Washington Post:http://wapo.st/1wKvPzH 
CBS News: http://cbsn.ws/1sLlXPO 

Facts were checked.
@_wapaa_ please note the word "opinion" at the top of your source :-) go away Tobe I'm not arguing with you on twitter :,)
@shreesters Please note the other 4 sources, and the complete fallacy in your logic
@BarackObama Salaries are private therefore most of us have no idea we are being unfairly paid.
@BarackObama As the President of the United States, I feel you're the one to do something about that.
@BarackObama :Long past time!!
@BarackObama when do..our bestrue wishes towards America & Nations being becoming best canbe in all topics in goodways
@BarackObama Hi Bo The charity can certainly be instrumental in alleviating gaps & sweats.'preciate you & mo's etc $gift to the charity
@BarackObama true for the men who have jobs.
@BarackObama Es hora de cerrar la brecha salarial entre hombres y mujeres.
@BarackObama nice thinking
@BarackObama Sir, WIDENING of gap in income of men & women in OLD AGE is not disparity. It is for sharing of more time by women with family.
@BarackObama @out2escape
@BarackObama story of my life. single mom- working for neuro in RI- can barely pay rent yet see my pt's abuse the system every day. it's sad
@BarackObama 50/50 culture still lives
@BarackObama how about we end the pay gap between the whole middle class and the elite execs? Bring the women with us!
@BarackObama this chart is vague and is not illustrative of any real trend. Stop jumping on mythical bandwagons and focus on the real issue.
@BarackObama let's start in the #WhiteHouse! It's one thing to talk the talk. Now walk the walk.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Needs to be done here in Sweden too!
@BarackObama 
How about starting with the White House
@BarackObama ur right. ..
@BarackObama count the wifes vacations as income and the problem is resolved
YES!!! “@BarackObama: It's time to close the pay gap between men and women. #OpportunityForAll ”
@BarackObama they say mishell is a man ??? What u gonna do next!!!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama takes time to change things. you can see it on the graph.
@BarackObama It's time to recognize the right of peoples to live
@BarackObama How about we increase local economies so people can afford to pay everyone more and stop out-sourcing our jerbs.
@BarackObama Please begin by looking at your own staff. Then you eliminate the "hypocrite" label.
@BarackObama I hope your increasing woman's wage and not decreasing men's to close that gap!!
“@BarackObama: It's time to close the pay gap between men and women. #OpportunityForAll ” about time
@BarackObama The gap shouldn't matter, equal pay for equal work. If a high paying field happens to be dominated by men, it skews the numbers
@BarackObama The fact the graph shows no/little gap until 29 suggests this may be the case. What can the gov do about lifestyle choices?
@BarackObama Could the widening pay gap be due to women having children at 29-30 then staying at home or going into part time employment?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama FOR THE LOVE OF GOD FOCUS ON REAL ISSUES!!!!! U r the worst.
@BarackObama Especially for your staff!
