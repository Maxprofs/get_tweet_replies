@BarackObama hahahaha!!!!!!
@BarackObama thanks for lowering prices. Credit is all yours?
@BarackObama Is that before or after you left wingers up the gas tax?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama when the price was up it was Obama's fault but now they are down he has nothing to do with it. "Really"
@BarackObama You mean some of the money that your policies have cost them on gas
@BarackObama gee you fought all the ways which oil was drilled and now you take credit? what a douche bag.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Only for a few months! Stop! Those families were loosing money for yrs, few months of orchestrated low gas will do squat #Lies
@BarackObama you had nothing to do with gas prices and never will have anything to do with them!
@BarackObama Sayın başkan hayranlıkla sizi takip ediyorum mükemmelsiniZ
@BarackObama  sizi seviyorum
@BarackObama And we can watch the train bombs blow up all over the country. Pass the Koolaid please.
@BarackObama You have nothing to do with falling gas prices & if it were up to you we would be paying 20.00 a gallon.
@BarackObama Yes, gas is down, despite your attempts at trying to keep it up or raise them so don't pretend you deserve credit. #Truth
@BarackObama Also oil was one of the only well paying growing jobs in the US so you should not be happy about it.
@BarackObama That is bad for me. I HAVE OIL STOCKS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Why Haliburton, why?
@BarackObama AFTER SPENDING A 1000.00 DOLLARS AT THE PUMP THE PAST SIX YEARS!!!! #HELPTHEMIDDLECLASS!!!!
@BarackObama oh so it's your doing that gas prices are down… but when they go up it's Bush's fault?
.@BarackObama lol if that's true, I'm spending it all on green tips, just because you want to ban them. #RKBA #2A #GoGreen
@BarackObama and you actually did more to prevent the price drop than help it
@BarackObama if oil prices were too high it would be bush's fault.
@BarackObama it sounds like your taking credit for something you have no control over.
.@BarackObama Whoa, with that and the $2500 you saved me on Obamacare you saved me -$6000 dollars! #NewMath
@BarackObama Just the opposite for us here in Europe,where Mr. Schauble is expressing the most NEGATIVE opinions on theEconomy of the others
MT: The typical family this year should save more than $700 at the pump, 100% in spite of me. @BarackObama
@BarackObama Yes but your policies had nothing to do with that yet you're here taking credit for it.
@BarackObama No thanks to Obama as he fights to stop US oil production, saving $ at the pump is all due to private business,
@barackobama Thank you South Texas. .
@BarackObama Not because of you, windbag.
@BarackObama if I didn't know better, I'd swear you were actually taking credit for this, despite opposing shale drilling, you cad.
@BarackObama please explain how this $700 helps the thousands who have lost jobs in the Oil and Gas industry.
@BarackObama Stop lying!!!!
