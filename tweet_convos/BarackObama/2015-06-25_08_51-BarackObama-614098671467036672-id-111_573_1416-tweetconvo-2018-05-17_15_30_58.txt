Hello @BarackObama you are the best president ever!
@BarackObama I'm sorry Mr president but my health insurance is the cost of my rent I don't understand how that's a benefit?
@BarackObama Mr President, please work to remove employer mandate. Adjunct faculty have had their loads decreased.
@BarackObama @bspence5 Of course we are: from the creation of nu jobs, to the coverage of 8.6mn to the controlling of prem increases.
@BarackObama  I would love to believe what you are saying sir
@BarackObama humiliation of poor countries is the International proven law

@BarackObama did you really say that?  Wow, you have sunk to a new low.  Shame on you.
