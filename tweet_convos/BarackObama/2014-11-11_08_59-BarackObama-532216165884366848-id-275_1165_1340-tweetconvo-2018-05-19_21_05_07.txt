@BarackObama I support high speed for all. What about you @domjoly ?
@tedreally @BarackObama @domjoly can't anyone buy a higher speed if they wish? #libcrib
@JosephStanley82 @BarackObama @domjoly in Europe we get between 30mb/s and 100mb/s for €35/month unlimited data with TV. What about USA?
@tedreally @BarackObama @domjoly package of TV data phone 100 + 40 in taxes
@JosephStanley82 @BarackObama @domjoly wow that's expensive, corporations must be rich. Do they reinvest in improving the network speed?
@tedreally @BarackObama @domjoly you can pay more for higher speeds it's known as customer choice
@JosephStanley82 @BarackObama @domjoly what if they behave as a cartel? Instead of reinvesting and lowering prices, they don't?
@tedreally @BarackObama @domjoly they are not on business to lower prices just to provide a service
