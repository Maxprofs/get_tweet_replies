@BarackObama As a Brit, who rather admires the US - YES!! It makes the nation look stupid, backward and frankly, dangerous..
@jasonpa81916386 @BarackObama have you people researched gun laws in the United states. Felons, mentally ill, and in bigger cities licensed.
@adamb7969 @BarackObama Guns should be banned... Sorry.
@jasonpa81916386 @BarackObama  well you will always be a victim them until you learn to protect yourself you can't count on other people to.
@adamb7969 @BarackObama ...we have some HUGE issues, but one of them largely is not the fear we're gonna be shot at.
@jasonpa81916386 @BarackObama I'm not scared of being shot I live in Oregon
@adamb7969 @BarackObama oh well, thats ok then hahahaha seriously, Im alright jack...
@jasonpa81916386 @BarackObama they don't seem to care when poor people get shot in America and that happens all day long by the hundreds.
@BarackObama @Padmasree it's time to address root causes and stop punishing innocent law-abiding gun owners for the actions of psychos
@wirednot @BarackObama @Padmasree Innocent law-abiding gun owners would not be affected by sensible changes.
@OfficialCK2013 @BarackObama @Padmasree travel to states with the most restrictive "sensible" changes that do ZIP to deter crime.
@wirednot Do you think it is sensible to allow mentally ill citizens to buy firearms?
@OfficialCK2013 Here's the part where you put words into other people's mouths and then take issue with them.
@wirednot It's a question, not an argument. Do you think the mentally ill should be allowed to purchase firearms?
@OfficialCK2013 have a pleasant day.
@wirednot Why won't you answer the question? It's the question that Democrats are asking. Don't believe all the NRA says.
@BarackObama challenging the freedom to bear arms to defend against oppressive governments. Land of the free, forget saying that.
@BarackObama RT's don't get laws passed Barack..
@Hawkins2fly @BarackObama but maybe public opinion can.....
@BarackObama bonjour Obama
@BarackObama @jjbenz19 This will not happen until all the Republicans are gone!
@ReisaMiller @jjbenz19 @BarackObama If all Democratic voters had voted in every election, gun control would have been taken care of yrs ago.
.@_Carja @jjbenz19 @ReisaMiller @BarackObama 
This is so true!
@BarackObama No you want to do something about gun control like confiscate our gun you need to tell the people the truth for a cange.
@BarackObama @Smudgeon Got your back, President, 'cause you got ours!! Thanks!
@BarackObama @jjbenz19 Like STOP sending arms to jihadi FSA terrorists in Syria!!
@BarackObama thank you Mr.President
@BarackObama think of all the times guns have saved people. the news only covers when "guns" kill
saw this on POTUS page. Guns can be helpful. Military (defending your freedom) and hunting (giving you food)
@BarackObama @jjbenz19 Of course, it's not about politics.
It's about money.
@ReverantRevan @jjbenz19 @BarackObama  Most gun sales are by  people who already own a gun. fewer and fewer new gun owing  households
@Jackson_Co_Dems @jjbenz19 @BarackObama The more guns you own, the higher the chance somebody who isn't you finds one.
Usually a child.

@BarackObama Everybody I know is totally sick of you and just waiting for the end of this Twilight Zone episode
Tax #guns & ammo to high heaven. Register & track ammo at point of sale. #DoSomething NOW! Where's my rights? @BarackObama @hardknoxfirst
@BarackObama @adriennefj Ok, give me an example of a new law that will curb gun violence?

I'll wait.
@BarackObama @AlisonSpalding2 Barack Obama should endorse Bernie Sanders for President #StandWithBernie #AllLivesMatter #VetsforBernie.org
@BarackObama @david_latham worked in Australia. America should wake up & realise guns kill innocent people.
@BarackObama If you start to treat guns the same way cars are registered & licensed, you could even create jobs.
@Graypets @BarackObama 
Like cars... And drivers: tested, registered, insured before being licensed!
@HighFiv49807762 @McConnellPress I TOTALLY AGREE.  IT IS PASS TIME TO ACT. SO ACT NOW.@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan @repjohnlewis
we love you
@BarackObama. The only thing that can be done about gun violence is to stop trying to take guns from those sane noncriminal.
#opencarry
@BeeksD that’s the *only* thing?
@r00k. No, there are others, but too many to name here.
@NicholasStix @RichardDawkins Hmmm...if more guns=greater safety,why doesn't the NRA want to be safe? Don't they believe there own BS?
@MichelleObama WE NEED YOU BOTH!PLEASE COME BACK!NO,REALLY!What are we to do Mr.Constitutional Attorney?Bring Joe w/you please?
@BarackObama @slsdem 
Ban criminals, for they will always have guns whether you ban guns or not.
@BarackObama @CathyTX Reasonable Gun Control~make guns "titled Property" like cars and require gun owners to be bonded for accountability!
@BarackObama The white right believes it will lose it entitlement; they know they usurped "Equality"!  They'll never partisan on Gun Safety.
@barackobama @favthngs Most Favorite Thing About Rewetting @Barackobama Is He's Always On Message & On Target; Truth @GOP Ignorance/Lies!
@BarackObama Gun culture must be curbed and a ban be imposed to stop violence and killing of innocent people
@BarackObama Control Laws, of any sort, are useless. History as shown this. Prohibition, Drug Control, and others. All yielded same results.
@BarackObama Yes

@BarackObama how many mass shootings will that take before you impose stricter laws? How many more lives will be ruined or taken?
@BarackObama only way to get America to give up the guns is for everyone else to do the same,that include nukes. Can you do that?

You could order the army to round up the republicans & put them in FEMA reeducation camps, and do it yourself.

@BarackObama The govt should make it easier to acquire small firearms so that the people can protect themselves from criminals.
@BarackObama Too much gun control only helps the criminals who don't get them legally in the first place.
@BarackObama Like make them similar to Chicago gun laws, where gun crime is high? We need to empower our people, not make them defenseless.
@JonBanquer @SupaReaper can you please explain? What are they imposing on Bernie? #Bernie2016
@JonBanquer @SupaReaper ah, got ya. I thought they were going to limit what he could discuss.

@BarackObama violent people do violent things. You should be focusing on our borders. Isn't that our biggest illegal import of drugs. GUNS
@BarackObama Do Something For INDIA Sir..
@BarackObama needs to remember that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

Talk to @seanhannity & @GlennBeck
@BarackObama Idiot take away the SS guns first then maybe somebody will listen to you.  In the meantime just keep screwing the Americans
@BarackObama register the serial number both the gun and the load.
@BarackObama it's not the guns. We need to focus on why people are in pain. The pain causes the person to shoot the gun.
@BarackObama
The federal government needs 2stay out of the second amendment! Every increase of federal control is 1 step closer 2 communism!
@BarackObama ya,i think it's high time to think about gun violence.
@BarackObama Good
@BarackObama @AlfredMcDougle Do what exactly? What do you propose that would have stopped ORegon shooting?
@PKfromCentralPA @BarackObama #GunControl is a very good start. But sounds like u want to pointlessly argue about that, which I wont do.
@AlfredMcDougle @BarackObama just sayin I haven't heard one proposal that would have stopped Oregon from happening.
@BarackObama that is a good news to speak against gun violence it is not a political issue Mr. President.
