@BarackObama just be president forever
@PrinceApocolysp @BarackObama that was just all kinds of stupid... would you have said that to a white guy not shredding the constitution?
@yazzle79 who said im looking at race? Oh that's you because that's the first thing you look at you dumb shit don't @ me again
@PrinceApocolysp you're the dumb one who has to say that you voted for him
@yazzle79 And I also support Bernie Sanders What's you're point? I'm not supporting anyone threw skin color because that doesn't effect me
@PrinceApocolysp @yazzle79 Under Socialism, you loose your income, your property rights, your freedom of religion and speech...dah!
@JordanCole48 @PrinceApocolysp don't be too upset at the socialist...
@yazzle79 @JordanCole48 don't label me because I can easily call you a bigot
@BarackObama You are not dictator. I love it when democracy works and radical politicians don't get to advance distortion of values
@OliverbeauSmith @BarackObama I heartily agree. Obamanation merely wants to run in a shill who will vote to remove our rights 2nd Ammendment
@JordanCole48 @BarackObama and to erode the family like they did with abortion, same sex marriage, and rest of the ongoing assault on Jesus
@Riley_L9 @OliverbeauSmith; How truly pathetic to think that there are people like you who blindly support evil and wicked men/women to rule
@JordanCole48 @Riley_L9 he isn't blind, he openly hates the biblical restraints that produced the very freedoms to express his hate.
@Riley_L9 @JordanCole48 Matthew 7:7 "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
“@BarackObama: Judge Merrick Garland deserves a fair hearing and a timely vote. #SCOTUSnominee ”#wellplayed
@chrise_ec @BarackObama You claim it, but it is not true. Merrick is an antagonist to the 2nd Amendment. Bye bye personal gun ownership.
@JordanCole48 @chrise_ec Conservatives liked Garland until @BarackObama nominated him.
GOP Sen Orrin Hatch: Merrick Garland "not only a fine nominee, but as good as Republicans can expect [from Clinton]"
Merrick Garland never undermined 2nd Amendment or Heller; firearms rulings conformed exactly to SCOTUS precedent.

"The selection of Garland, 63, could disappoint avid liberals" with his record of GOP support.

So if the Senate doesn't confirm Merrick Garland, let POTUS retaliate with a recess appointment of Jacqueline Nguyen 

@BarackObama @NPR
@nicolesherburne @BarackObama @NPR That's touchy to POTUS. USSC said Obama's recess appointments were unconstitutional. No recess since 2011
@dreamwriter9 @BarackObama @NPR Fair point. But he could threaten it, maybe?? What stick can he use to back up this carrot?
@nicolesherburne @BarackObama @NPR Publicly apologize for tweeting his push for a petition demanding the Senate "do your job".
Oops..open mike..Here's ur collusion
I REALLY DO HAVE A CRUSHED ON YOU BARACK OBAMA?
@BarackObama f
@BarackObama its politics so don't take it personal. Didn't you say you wouldn't vote for any nominee from Bush?
@SonnySondog7 @BarackObama 
At least the nominees were given a vote and not just ignored. Even politicians have to do their job.
@MC_OG @SonnySondog7 @BarackObama The Senate has no legal mandate to consider Merrick. Read Article 1 and 2 of the U S Constitution.
@BarackObama right after the election. Sure thing. #2A
@AhrensJedi @BarackObama "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state"= Switzerland model, no standing military
@nicolesherburne @AhrensJedi @BarackObama Switzerland is a small landlocked country surrounded by mountains. We're not!Thank a vet your here
@Halo9x @AhrensJedi @BarackObama Just saying the original Constitution intent was no standing army. How does interpretation of 2A fit that?
@nicolesherburne taught the country a valuable lesson, weakness invites attack? We have disarmed after every war, to our regret.
.@Halo9x ?

@DynCorpIntl @northropgrumman @LockheedMartin @Raytheon @ColtFirearms @BoeingDefense won't let us disarm
@nicolesherburne I think it's rather the world that won't let us disarm. Time to wake up and smell the coffee!
I wouldn't RETWEET him if I were you & I wanted 2 win,way 2 MUCH BAD luggage here,watch Hillary's America and Obama's America on DVD and books.true facts very scary,did you all plantation owners & KKK WERE DEMS,TALK ABOUT RACISTS,FACISTS
@BarackObama Im so not ready for you to go. As a mother, and disabled i fear a republican getting in office.
@gm_shana @BarackObama When you money is worthless and you want to blame someone, look in the mirror.
Here's what DEMOCRATS do...
I agree! ALL deserve a fair hearing & trial before guilt or punishment is assigned. The problem is you & your administration set in motion a “progressive” reform where trial by media is the norm. It’s your own attitudes you now rally against! Your “chickens have come to roost.”
@BarackObama Of course he does!  It's Obama's job to appoint a Superior Court replacement. Garland seems like a Perfect Fit!
Garlands stance on gun rights and ownership negates ANY chance of him being accepted as a USSC Justice.
@BarackObama I believe he is a good choice, I don't believe the GOP should  block or refuse to meet and seriously consider this appointee.
@mrroy_e @BarackObama I believe they should refuse to, and that is democracy
@OliverbeauSmith Hold the court hostage, the people that R waiting for decissions disagree. The GOP is loosing it. So all Hail TRUMP.
@mrroy_e his the reprobate mind is in the court already, ex. Humans babies are not human and have no rights. Homosexuality is not sin etc
GFY Obama!
HE IS GOING TO BE MY BOYFRIEND AND MY HUSBAND AND MY EVERYTHING EVERYONE'S.
MY BF IS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA?
@BarackObama 100% Agree & I am sure I lean more to the right than you do. ;-)
@BarackObama Merrick is a proven antogonist against the 2nd Amendment. You seek a SCOTUS who will disarm the American people.
@BarackObama MARRY ME (?)
o.O
@BarackObama Wish POTUS took Benghazi,IRS,Hillary's email scandals seriously.The country deserves to know the truth @HillaryClinton HilLIARy
@BarackObama and we need a timely indictment of Hillary Clinton.  Thank you.
@johnpalomino @BarackObama Obamanation and his DOJ bootlickers will not indict Hillary "Jezebel" Clinton. Never happen. She is above the law
@BarackObama I'm actually impressed.  Not a far leftist and an extremely decent resume.  But don't expect support from most conservatives.
@juggalo_six @BarackObama stay classy, but with a name like juggalo, betting that's going to be a stretch for you.
@BarackObama and Americans need a fair vote and timely hearings on voter fraud and suppression
@BarackObama I support you
@BarackObama u need Cubana Chant by Art Blakey and my dad Pat Patterson sing HusainHusainBrack Obama

@BarackObama @DarrellIssa Darrell Issa. Do your job please, and hold confirmation hearings for this man.
@BarackObama absolutely
@BarackObama absolutely
@BarackObama he deserves what you say he deserves but you can't be fair or a good president for us? You are delusional like your followers.

@BarackObama So he has "philosophy, ideology, and record" that the GOP Senate will approve? Or they can't use the rules you used for Alito?
@BarackObama So did Alito.  Shut up liar.
@BarackObama That's not what Harry Reid said.
@BarackObama try going on vacation on YOUR dime, 10%er! And keep your feet off the desk in the Oval Office. It belongs to US not you!
@BarackObama You're sure the one to tell others to do their job! How much have your vacations added to the national debt???
@BarackObama #whats wrong with those Republicans
@BarackObama @SgyYogarajah IT IS HOPED BY MEN OF RIGHT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RETROSPECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SENATE WILL SHOW RIGHT PATH YES
@BarackObama Have a hearing and vote. If not, then, Congress is not doing their job.
@BarackObama Thank you. We have to stand up to the Dark side, not patronize them.
@BarackObama - NO!  NEVER!
@BarackObama do your job senate and house give this guy a fair hearinh
