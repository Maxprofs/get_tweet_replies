@BarackObama @chriscmooney then why can't Americans live off the grid without being punished?
@karolynsmithMP @9975Ts @BarackObama @chriscmooney Hell, we've got 12+ Million illegals living in the shadows. Why not go off the grid?
@BarackObama Put work release prisoners to work installing solar panels and inmates building them! Solar for Seniors/poor who own homes!
@terrisoucek @9975Ts @BarackObama Sounds practical... Where's that guy installing my solar panels? What? He's in my bedroom?
@IvoryDove @9975Ts @BarackObama Under supervision, of course!
@terrisoucek @9975Ts @BarackObama A government supervisor? Like the prison guard guys who deal drugs to prisoners?
@BarackObama. Sir, how are you going to help Ugandans according to the hard situation of killings?
@BarackObama Why does http://N.V.Energy  try everything they can to control wind and solar energy. ????
@BarackObama is madman-in-chief 2 NOT understand Climate change is a HOAX & Ponzi Scheme. RU incapable of telling the truth?
@BarackObama your #green energy math is #unsustainable.  How much more coal is burned to make solar and wind power reality? Audittheauditors
@BarackObama Not cheaper here. If you use solar you utility rates go up!
@BarackObama I don't comprehend how some people are incredibly rude when they offer opinions!
@BarackObama 最近のお気に入りのツイート欄がいつの間にかオバマさんのスピーチの一説になっていた。「電力システム改革」に向けての思し召しか。

@BarackObama what about the billions of taxpayer money you wasted on this years ago?  Haven't forgotten!!
@BarackObama yeah.you showed us well with Solyndra
@BarackObama I prefer to call it cost effective. Cheap was always used to define poor quality growing up.
@BarackObama  That is good news, Mr Obama.
@BarackObama @roseofthesealee He's got a lot of space! But still. . . . . .
@BarackObama Conglatulations!

Wind/solar are the future. GOP cling to fossil fuel, saying green energy hurts US$. Only $ green energy hurts is GOP's pockets

@BarackObama @chriscmooney It should become the WAY!
@BarackObama He is really a great man
@BarackObama she's kinda hot tho
@BarackObama when you regulate coal and gas to death, it becomes more expensive. Solar hasn't become cheaper, other methods priced up. Dick!
@BarackObama actually, the cost is still out of reach for middle class families and it's only cheaper because you made gas & coal expensive.
@BarackObama make a stand with force if need be get our point across we look like a joke on the world stage plus our allies will leave us
@BarackObama we have to do what we say period talk is cheap putin as he really is lies and laughs at us honestly we do nothing it gets worse

@BarackObama what if it fails in 2020 What if the sun goes down never came up. What if the government is hiding stuff. Tell us the truth
@BarackObama http://news.yahoo.co.jp/pickup/6176987 オバマは自分で自分が恥ずかしくはないのか？IS対策成果なく見直しとか。オバマの無能さによって、アサド温存で和平工作するしか選択肢がなくなってしまった。早期から自由シリア軍にロシアみたいに武器や供与してれば。
@BarackObama http://news.yahoo.co.jp/pickup/6176987 早期に自由シリア軍に武器など供与してアサド政権倒していれば、ISが生まれることもなく、シリアは今頃平和になっていた。それを放置した挙げ句今の混沌たる状況で、ロシアが台頭して、もう米国の出る幕はない。失せろ
@BarackObama http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20151010-00000003-jij-n_ame …今更武器供与って、穏健な反政府派なんてもう残っていないだろが、アホか？3年は遅いんだよ！！！自由シリア軍がそれこそ元気でアサド軍と対峙していた頃に武器供与しろよ！今は過激派とISぐらいしか残っていないぞ！カス
@BarackObama We could save billions of $$$ and fossil fuels with proper Mechanical Insulation installed on our piping systems @isaveteam
@BarackObama every time Congress passes something obama says he will Veto it! 
Then calls Congress do nothing! 
He's the do nothing
@BarackObama They may be cheaper but they are regulated to the point a citizen cannot put one on their property.
@BarackObama yes sir
@BarackObama But the cost of freedom remains the same: unachievable . #TPP
@BarackObama Propaganda. Too much space for so little return. Don't choke-hold fossil fuel industries til wind/solar are further developed.
@BarackObama RT : #EsViernesY  Nos sumamos a la búsqueda de @ElTunante2 . Difundir. Gracias
@BarackObama @chriscmooney
@BarackObama wind and solar are great supplements but if the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining you are in the dark
@BarackObama  Thatt's good news, we also need cleaner fossil fuels to protect environment; save jobs;&keep energy costs down.
@BarackObama  Wind and piss cost nothing at all and the world is full of it.
