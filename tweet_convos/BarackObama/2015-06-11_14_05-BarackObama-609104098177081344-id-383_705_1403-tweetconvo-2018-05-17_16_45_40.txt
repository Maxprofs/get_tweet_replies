@BarackObama There was a measurable drop in ocean levels in 2011. The missing water was being dumped on Australia.
@BarackObama Is this also caused by CO2 gas?
@BarackObama Yes , but the rains in Spain, fall mainly on the plain.

@BarackObama Aren't we supposed to be in a drought because of so much hot air?
@BarackObama no climate change.ignorant you are.Nature has a way of balance and reset.By the GOD of Jacob.JESUS is lord and maker of all..
@BarackObama So pretty much what you are saying is that weather is evil? #WarOnWeather Too hot bad. Too cold bad. Too dry bad. Too wet bad.
@BarackObama We can't stop a rain (top-down), but we can reduce pollution (bottom-up). Massive adaptation.
@BarackObama Ridiculous statistic! How can you measure 211 trillion gallons of rainfall unless you capture all of it in one place?
@BarackObama I remember when I was a child they had on the news don't walk on the snowbanks on the side of the road.from MASS

@BarackObama This has to be one of the stupidest things ever tweeted. And that's saying a lot.
@BarackObama #ActOnClimate The same happened in Lagos nigeria last night...
@BarackObama who cares!!  How about we worry about our national security or maybe our growing national debt.
@BarackObama Great now build a big aqua duct all the way to California and other draught areas ; )
@BarackObama And not a drop  here in Vegas
@BarackObama but since we don't have data BEFORE records were kept, isn't it plausible that this has happened MANY times over the eons?
@BarackObama sadly, none of it was in California.
