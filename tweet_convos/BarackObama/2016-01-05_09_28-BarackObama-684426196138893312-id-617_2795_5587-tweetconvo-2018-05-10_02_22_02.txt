@BarackObama Thank you for making a stand, however small.  Our whole family is Republican, we voted for you, and believe you care, a lot.
@BarackObama It's way too easy for someone like the man who shot the college girl in Texas in her car driving home,because someone disagreed
@BarackObama I grew up with guns, and we never would have thought to use one pointed at a person for whatever reason, except protection.
@BarackObama  There are far too many guns, too many in the wrong hands where shooting someone is just a way to deal with anger or an insult
@BarackObama  Great job today sir!  Why is there such an uproar over registration,  well checked out, selling and buying of deadly weapons?
