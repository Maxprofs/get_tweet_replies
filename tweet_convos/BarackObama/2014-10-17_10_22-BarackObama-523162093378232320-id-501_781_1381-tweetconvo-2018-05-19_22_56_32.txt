@BarackObama worry less about minimum wage and more about #Ebola #ISIS YOU ARE A DISGRACE AND A PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A PRESIDENT! #tcot
@GTMAC21 It'd be important to point out that the person who tends to oversee medical crises, the Surgeon Gen, you won't vote on. #ShareBlame
@edwood_not who controls air travel in and out of the country? Who can ban flights from  #Ebola countries? #Obola #Obama
@GTMAC21 @edwood_not Greg it's in the USA already. Too late
@kurdycat00 @edwood_not if there's a hole in your roof and it starts to rain do you stop trying to fix it because your floor is wet?
@GTMAC21 @kurdycat00 Unlike rain though, viruses like this one require direct contact between people. Something a SG is supposed to explain.
@edwood_not @kurdycat00 my point is you don't stop trying to keep it out. 10 to 15 flights from West Africa land here daily #insanity
@GTMAC21 IE: "You can't fly to the U.S. but you can fly to Mexico/Canada/etc" kind of thing
That's completely flawed logic @BarackObama. If you want a stronger economy, abolish the min. wage altogether. #RaiseTheWage .... not
@belcher_jr @BarackObama so are you going to be the first to work for $1 per hour?
Did that, then got an ed & took personal responsibility. I don't live off others. Min wage jobs not careers morons @matmounce @BarackObama
@belcher_jr @BarackObama  back in the stone ages when you wked 4 $1 maybe not but since your GOP pals off shored mil of jobs they R careers.
Dem regs to blame for offshore jobs. Quit crying the victim, get an ed & take some responsibility @matmounce @BarackObama
@belcher_jr @BarackObama Nice try. So you want no regs because industries have proven desire to put safety B4 profit? That's responsibility?
Less reg's & FAR less taxes. Gov't doesn't belong in social services biz wasting my money  @matmounce @BarackObama
@belcher_jr @BarackObama what do regs have to do with soc services? Can use my money for the needy & they can use your money for war. Happy?
@BarackObama  yes I agree ..
@HafedAlGhwell ... Moron!!!
@JasonS1969 @HafedAlGhwell such intellect on display with that one word. Not
@matmounce @HafedAlGhwell ... sorry, but its the only word that truly describes Morons like you and all the other sheep that depend on Gov.
@JasonS1969 @HafedAlGhwell OK Einstein.
@barackobama  A minimum wage boost will normally depress an economy,but in current conditions, I believe that it could stimulate demand &...
@BarackObama Strong Yes!
“@BarackObama: Add your name if you agree: Higher wages are key to a stronger economy—and that starts with a higher minimum wage." No.

@BarackObama I'm with ya.
@BarackObama Patricia kiernan
@BarackObama Whats the point of raising minimum wage when everything else is going to go up ?
@BarackObama Higher wages only allow one thing.. the government can milk even more cash out of the cash cows (citizens) to spend poorly.
@BarackObama no. it means less jobs and more people getting fired because businesses can't afford to pay and still make a profit
@BarackObama more full time jobs would lift more people out of poverty. Just sayin.
@BarackObama actually with a higher minimum wage, prices will inflate and the cost of living will be even higher
@BarackObama  현재의 국민은 높는 질의 삶을과 이상이 있어 더나은 질과 높은 임금을 바라는 것이 자연적인 추세에서 낮은 임금의 추구는 아시아의 영향과 모델로 하는 것인데.새로운 생산적 경제를 만드는 시초::사이버 대통령김인태 ITKIM:
@BarackObama 오바마정책은 미국 국민의 임금의 문제가 아니라 미국인의 사고 방식의 전환으로 사회의 일원으로 하여 기업의 성공과 각개인의 성공이 같이 하는 정책으로 그것이 국가 경제의 성공으로 이어지는 정책으로!!:사이버 대통령김인태itkim:
@BarackObama Agree!
@BarackObama yes I agree
@CherylGrasso ... moron!!!
@BarackObama yes but that would make everything more expensive and wouldn't taxes go up then???
@priyankamaslow @BarackObama yes, thats the goal. More income tax collection.
@65_sandalwood @BarackObama which is why things should just stay the way they are. He's telling us the pros of the plan leaving out the cons
@priyankamaslow @65_sandalwood @BarackObama there are no cons. It's been proven many times over.
@matmounce @priyankamaslow @BarackObama what's San Fran's minimum wage and unemployment rate?
@BarackObama I totally agree! Empower the impoverished, raise living standards for all and you'll do far more than improve the economy.
Jon

@BarackObama this is why I love US equality for all.
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama Democracy is an American ! All of them were killed by the USA!
@BarackObama 그래요 낮은 임금으로 계속 진행된다면 그 효율로 강한 경제가 이루어 지지요. 당연한 결과로 이루어 질것입니다. 오바마도 세계의 평균보다도 조금 높은 차원의 임금으로 미국을 깨울려고 하는군요!!::사이버 대통령김인태ITKIM::
@BarackObama Hey wonderful president!...what if one was making 10 $ an hour already?
@BarackObama that starts w/ppl who provide quality work, not ppl who provide shit work with no skills who want high pay. Wake up u traitor
@BarackObama john paul

@BarackObama china rusia ..empieza la decadencia de e e u u
@BarackObama yes I agree
@BarackObama But this will only work if inflation remains steady- History says it won't- so what else can we do?
@BarackObama.      I back my president all the way he is to smart for the other party.  Al Jones
@BarackObama debasing the currency is what weakens the economy. Inflation robs the value of work by decreasing the value of wages.
@BarackObama anyone who thinks raising the min wage will help is a idiot. Employers will make up the lost profits In other places. No help.
@BarackObama *Not only a higher minimum wage, but...*
@BarackObama yes raising minimum wage would bring alot of people out of poverty.

@BarackObama of course trickle down economics are a fools notion. They rely on big business not being greedy which is rare.
@barackobama
@BarackObama I Agree
@BarackObama Hailie mathers
@BarackObama Only way that will work to grow the economy is to stop raising taxes on businesses so they can offset the difference.

@BarackObama yes sir its the most important factor of motivation.
@BarackObama

@BarackObama

@BarackObama how about we use some of that money to donate to this charity I'm raising money for with some friends? http://www.gofundme.com/fnc2jw 
@BarackObama Let's make sure all hospitals are equipped and trained to handle Ebola.
@BarackObama agree. ..though cost of living will increase.   Food cost will definitely increase.
@BarackObama The minimum wage debate takes away air time from the real problem i.e. a failure of our political leaders to work together.
@BarackObama  example:starbucks billion dollar company-salary $9.40/hr! is this a joke?
@BarackObama example:starbucks billion dollar company-salary $9.40/hr! is this a joke?
@BarackObama I do support higher minimum wage.
@BarackObama  It goes like this. Profitable company Lower cooperate Tax- less taxes+ higher more people =  higher pay & more tax revenue
@BarackObama  I agree
@BarackObama agree
@BarackObama how about raising the pay of the armed force that fight for freedom
@BarackObama Lower taxes are key to a stronger economy.
@BarackObama yeah that's very nice
@BarackObama
@BarackObama olopplo ni e jooo baba dudu
@BarackObama is there enough capitol to support the wage increase? I feel that it's important to avoid like the DOT.COMS trading on nothing.

@BarackObama fred
@BarackObama Maurice Marria.I agree Mr prez.make it happen through Congress.
@BarackObama dankie obama
@BarackObama fine jesus....
@BarackObama Minimum wage is not a LIVING WAGE! You are weakening the economy and causing inflation while you're at it.
@BarackObama less expense by the govt means better econmy and low cost. better econmy means better jobs and probably better wages.
@BarackObama Of course!! We Can Agree!  Sir.
@BarackObama That's great, until the price of everything else also starts to go up and we're back to the same place we're at now...
@BarackObama i agree
@BarackObama i agrree
@BarackObama We will NEVER have across the board prosperity as long as #Fed thinks wage growth is inflationary. http://www.putgrowthfirst.com/is_income_growth_for_the_bottom_90_prosperity_or_inflation …
@BarackObama Why did you nominate a #Fed chair who thinks wage growth is inflation? #MakesNoSense http://www.putgrowthfirst.com/is_income_growth_for_the_bottom_90_prosperity_or_inflation … @PutGrowth1st
@BarackObama WHY accept stagnation & raise minimum wage, lets raise all market wages, here's how http://www.putgrowthfirst.com/is_income_growth_for_the_bottom_90_prosperity_or_inflation … @PutGrowth1st
@BarackObama Stronger Economy,  RESCHEDULE MARIJUANA!  Please

@BarackObama
 no doubt in it, very true
@BarackObama what happens to the people who worked hard the last 5-10 years to get from minimum wage to where they are now? #bettergetaraise
@BarackObama My Hon Leader.. I reluctantly agree to this statement. The question is what is HIGHER and how does it  affect inflation?
@barackobama I think its cutting down debt dependancy. A higher minimum wage doesnt mean i will have more to spare.
@BarackObama nyc president
@BarackObama  minimum wages, human dignity is not compatible

@BarackObama I agree satisfied workers are the basis of a strong economy
@BarackObama 
 Agreed that when you pay liveable salaries then people's work hard to grow the economy. This the way to uplift the economy.
@BarackObama but what's the impact on businesses who are already struggling to deliver profit vital to their survival?
@BarackObama  hello Barack , why u don't help kurdistan ?! To clean ( da'ash) in Kurdistan.
