@BarackObama where was all this during the midterms? Instead all I heard was gloom and doom. @DarkMission1
@twohomos @DarkMission1 U listen 2 too much MSM media. AKA Corporate republican talking points&some cong-dems got chicken #ODS @BarackObama
@professorx10 the voting public listens to MSM and it's proven to be an abject failure at reporting real news. @DarkMission1 @BarackObama
@twohomos @DarkMission1 Yes MSM (Main Stream Media) with Repub talking points & cowardly Dems who ran away from Pres @BarackObama achievmnts
@professorx10 the deck was stacked against D's but they didn't even fight, they ran. that's not who we are. @DarkMission1 @BarackObama
Interesting Chart: +2.65 mill jobs in the US so far in 2014 = more than any full year since late 90s  via @BarackObama
@othertwice @BarackObama Guess in Europe all employees work that amount more instead of creating Jobs for unemployed youth.
@ThomasATgourmet therefore: employee contentment in free fall http://www.kellyocg.com/Workforce_Trends/Employee_Contentment_Infographic/#.VIQiBIrGLCQ … such we don't just burn out individuals but companies
@othertwice did not get the Point between grafics and your Arguments - brain still on party?
@ThomasATgourmet growing % of staff dissatisfied with their jobs. Too much dump on the best & not enough opportunity created for the young.
@othertwice well, got your Point, but the grafics is about volatility of employees??
@ThomasATgourmet those surveys are done yearly, e.g. actively disengaged employees from 15% (2001) to 24% (2012) [Gallup] in Germany
@othertwice ok, see what you mean, guess These insights are not for mobile studies :-)
@BarackObama  If the minimum wage is raised  we could start to see the return of the middle class, got to get GOP and money out.
@Leefellerguy @BarackObama Ppl need a living wage! Give it to them. At least price at pump, is giving some relief to all.
@TrulyVivvy @BarackObama  What is with diesel being so much higher?
@Leefellerguy @BarackObama Write /tweet your Congressman

@BarackObama  since all those low paying jobs won't pay the bills.. why don't you split your pay with us so we have level playing field?
@BarackObama blame your state if they hired the illegals... big corps are the ones who pushed temp work permits.... one word "BUSH" ...
@BarackObama and they all went to illegals!
@BarackObama @VicenxuPalauet the problem is in the type of work and the destruction of the middle class
