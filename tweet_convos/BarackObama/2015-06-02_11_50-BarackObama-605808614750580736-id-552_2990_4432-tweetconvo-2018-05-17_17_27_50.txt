@BarackObama our taxes are being wasted on this gun control agenda which will never happen. I want a refund.
@BarackObama your gun control efforts only affect law abiding citizens, not criminals. That is why your efforts are defeated.
@BarackObamaة

@BarackObama this is good. But please remember that 95 percent of gun related crimes are committed using non-registered or illegal guns.
@BarackObama We should be against all violence, not just the weapon of choice. Getting stabbed or beaten doesn't make it any less violent.

@BarackObama Voilence at any form is harmful to society too
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Orange is the new black after all!
@BarackObama What amazes me is the lack of respect shown for you and your office, Mr. President. Stand for decency and non-violence.

@BarackObama Hello Mr. President, thanks for all you've done! Praying for you!
@BarackObama Another twitter-cool sanctimonious load of $#!+. #wearingorange
@BarackObama  thank you for standing up!
@BarackObama I had you today Mr. President or my I call you "O" like Sam Wickwicky? (Not sure on spelling)
@BarackObama help stop the violence. We're behind  you.
@BarackObama @Smith83K Is that why your Attorney General, Eric Holder, sold guns to Mexican Drug Cartels? #cdnpoli
@BarackObama:  The more guns there are available the more violence and deaths there will be.  The same for drugs.
@BarackObama wouldn't this just make me an easier target?
@BarackObama @Ryan_Eggold Just remember this is about violence not control
@BarackObama Hope people will start changing laws and not be talked into not doing anything because of their "rights".
@BarackObama what's up with Congress not voting about our war issues? Mr. President, I am sorry you having to deal with this.
@BarackObama @MXMCXD nuestros polos de PJ! :P
@valerie1018 Tomorrow when you're wearing blue or green or brown go here http://momsdemandaction.org/   Oh and @BarackObama WTF w/#TPP? Please RT
@BarackObama Hey Mr.President
@BarackObama -not merely an object that creates a sub-category of the real issue.
@BarackObama That is how we should stand up to gun violence. By targeting the root of the problem,
@BarackObama gun violence? Wtf happened to criminal violence! You can stab,rape,beat,burn alls good with ya tards. As long as its not a gun?
@BarackObama -Of using guns only for defense, don't deserve to have them.
@BarackObama Guns, as with most things in life, require responsibility. People who cannot handle the responsibility-
@BarackObama Thank you President Obama for standing up for life!  #WearingOrange for my son and all the Americans affected by gun violence!
@BarackObama The losses to "Gun Violence" fall on the shoulders of violent people who had no right to have guns.
@BarackObama How can you stand up against gun violence, short of becoming a martyr, without another gun?
@BarackObama The real problem with gun violence is essentially the latter part of the phrase, violence.
@BarackObama @Ryan_Eggold GUNS ARE NOT VIOLENT! PEOPLE ARE..
@BarackObama Education is the must powerful weapon which you can used to change the world
@BarackObama It really should be called National Illegal Gun violence awareness day #NinjaWisdom
@BarackObama Thank you for #WearingOrange on this 1st National Awareness Day to End Gun Violence! ONE LOVE
@BarackObama not me
@BarackObama @Ryan_Eggold Weird. I've never seen a gun be violent.
@BarackObama It's not the cold piece of metal that is 'violent', it's the one holding it that is. Enforce the laws. CLOSE U.S. BORDERS
@BarackObama  Rohingya Muslims too are human beings like us and have every right to live.please do something for them
@BarackObama I'm wearing for you my POTUS.  God protect you and First Lady.
@BarackObama #VICTIMOFVIOLENTCRIMES
@BarackObama go to hell. You'll have to kill me first
@BarackObama How's that #GunControl in Chicago doing? I thought #BlackLivesMatter When the narrative doesn't fit? You don't say shit?
@BarackObama  Standing against gun violence? OR STANDING AGAINST THE MURDER OF CHRISTIANS BY ISIS?
@BarackObama As you hide behind armed guards.
@BarackObama More gun control is not the solution. Think of it like this. Don't push people on this.
@BarackObama   Orange is a prison color.  Of course criminals want us disarmed.
@BarackObama So What Color Are You Progressives Gonna Wear About The
"BLACK VIOLENCE"?...
@barackobama / Good Morning Night Sir. God Bless U All Sir
@BarackObama #Please wear Orange today.
