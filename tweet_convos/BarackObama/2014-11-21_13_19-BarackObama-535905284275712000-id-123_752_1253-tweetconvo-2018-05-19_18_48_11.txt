@BarackObama  good point. to get papers w/ this plan people have to jump through hoops, and are not yet citizens https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWQdxGayx4 …
@BarackObama Everything this idiot does in office is NULL & VOID, he is NOT AN AMERICAN, do your LEGAL jobs IDIOTS and REMOVE THIS FOOL!
@BarackObama Amnesty is an official pardon..which is what you just provided to those who came to America illegally.
@BarackObama Now we know why you've sealed all your school records; it's because you really ARE that stupid; amnesty is what you just did!
@BarackObama how big of an idiot do you think we are???
“@BarackObama: “critics call this action amnesty. It's not. Amnesty is what we have now"Thing's you've not read: 1.Constitution 2.Dictionary
@BarackObama Thank you sir. God will bless you and everything associated with you.

@BarackObama
@BarackObama And stop playing with the peoples life for a fist of vote ...!!
@BarackObama What the fuck is wrong with the Amnest..Amnesty  for All..that's  the answer of this problem..
@BarackObama OK, now that's a stretch for even me.  Where did you get THAT one from?
@BarackObama the President should represent the lawful people of the United States not illegal immigrants!!!! Don't you think?
@BarackObama #If you want to get technical, nobody here is a real American. The real Americans are the Native Americans # truth.
@BarackObama i dont know wht the hell is wrong with stupid congress they cant do anything right this country doesnt even belong to any of us

@BarackObama you really dug yourself a hole on this one Barry. #ImmigrationAction #TheFive
@BarackObama Preach it Prez
@BarackObama Hey ofa, BIOYA.
@BarackObama LIAR!!
@BarackObama No. What we have now is a bunch of lazy, greedy politicians that have lost their way. Listen to the people. #legalizemarijuana
@BarackObama I support your position but not your misuse of "amnesty": an official pardon for those convicted of political offenses.
“@BarackObama: “I know some critics call this action 'amnesty.' It's not amnesty. Amnesty is what we have now.” —President Obama
@BarackObama You can spin it anyway you want  IT'S still AMNESY to the American Citizens and thats all that matters SECURE THE BORDER NOW
@BarackObama Is President Obama forgetting that he is not a man of the cloth but a leader of a system ?
@BarackObama Bout dat action boss
@BarackObama  4Mr president.
@BarackObama To favor illegal over legal makes one as a President, a questionable potential fraud in book keeping, management of the purse.
@BarackObama Allowing people to stay who have broken the law to get here is amnesty Mr. President.
@BarackObama I call this emancipation. You are King and Ruler. You are god and savior!
@BarackObama Anyone who hires illegal people should be charged the cost's of managing illegal immigrants after caught committing the fraud.
@BarackObama I agree it is not amnesty, it's lawlessness on your part!  How does it feel to be a law breaker and liar at the same time?
@BarackObama Thank u for inforning the R's that have NO IDEA about facts on 99% of issues but as long as their 1,2% is good who cares

@BarackObama Who in the hell would you think I am if you could not kick me out of you're very large house having entered it illegally ? Laws
@BarackObama from the @billclinton English class. The definition of "is"
@BarackObama GREAT SPEECH
@BarackObama Mr President, could u explain to @matteorenzi that #immigrationsituation in usa is a little different from other states?
@BarackObama You sir are a Race Baiting Bigot and should be In JAIL
@BarackObama True. Amnesty is having a Consular Officer deny you a tourist visa to spend Christmas with your US family 'cause he is God.
@BarackObama  theres a lot of need.. but it cant get fixed all at once.. happy that at least your trying to work something up.
@BarackObama i know what that means lol
@BarackObama Thanks
@BarackObama  very happy that your taking an action.. happy that you know is not only Latino who are immigrants. One step at the time. 
@BarackObama Can I be illegal too ? To force you to have me ? It's extortion ! It's disrespectful of the law. It's a scam upon all legal 1's
@BarackObama what we have now is lawlessness now because you don't chose to enforce the laws we have now.
@BarackObama Lack of enforcement is what we have now
@BarackObama This is the KALERGI PLAN. Equal for the Europe.
@BarackObama necesitamos papeles para vivir mejor y darle mejor Vida a mis hijos

@BarackObama Amnesty is the forgiveness of a past offense especially to groups.

@BarackObama Keep going Sir!
@BarackObama no what we have now is a lack of obedience to the law!
@BarackObama The illegal immigrants no matter the good invention in the valey, would likely amount to nothing without the US market or help.
@BarackObama we also have a LEGAL system for tyrannts
@barackobama keep spinning but we are not stupid
@BarackObama هلا اوباما ياخي تعال اسعوديه تقهو
@BarackObama I think you should take a Constitution & Bill of Rights Class. Obviously you have little regard of the voters opinions.
LIBERAL LOGIC 101 “@BarackObama: “I know some critics call this action 'amnesty.' It's not amnesty. Amnesty is what we have now.” — Obama
@BarackObama  THE best
.@BarackObama So, why did you toss the Constitution out window?
@BarackObama America needs to look deep within, and stop closing your eyes to problems of the original people of the country!
