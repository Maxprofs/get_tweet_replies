@BarackObama Wiggleword-a-rama.  Meaningful and long-term are in the eye of the socialist beholder.  #KeystoneXL
@psennett When we & other developed nations want to reduce carbon, Keystone would increase the dirtiest, most inefficient oil there is.
@ACslater017 "We" don't want to reduce carbon. YOU want to reduce carbon. Sane people understand CO2 is required for life on earth.
@psennett Please take high school science
@BarackObama in all reality what does he really care he is just going to pass it on to the next guy...#savetheenvironment
@BarackObama But, would it have made a meaningful and long-term impact on Canada's economy?
@BarackObama Hi barack, it's me.
@BarackObama is not mincing lobbyists bank books and politics in rejecting #KeystoneXL pipeline. Environment first.
@BarackObama I'm so gald you rejected the pipeline.
@BarackObama No longer the Antichrist we thought you were. Now we must convince those who had you convinced in 2012. #NoKXL #Exxonknew
@BarackObama Neither to our own. I am Canadian. I believe in climate change. You are a great leader. You have chosen health over wealth.
@BarackObama good job Mr president
@BarackObama Your really ana--!
@BarackObama another bad decision. You confuse your wants and needs with America's
@BarackObama #KeystoneXL your legacy,Iran gets nuke, expensive health care, renewed race issues,Russian aggression wow nice work dude
@BarackObama thank-you
@BarackObama disagree
@BarackObama or the environment
@BarackObama
@BarackObama #WrongForAmerica
@BarackObama OK I'm sure we will get the pipeline as soon as it's calculated on who's pockets we need to run it through.
@BarackObama I just think in General it would not be good for environment.
@BarackObama i hate you get out of office trump for the win
@BarackObama I think it would I disagree with President
@BarackObama the #KeystoneXL pipeline was never about jobs or economy. But rather big oil companies lobbying the @GOP to build their dream$
@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama  I guess you think getting gas from our enemy's is a good thing and yes Islam is an enemy!. Just like you are to America!
@BarackObama You just keep tearing this country apart! GOD HELP US! Why do you hate America so? @realDonaldTrump
He thought he wasGod's gifttoAmerica! The strut is over.We dont want you anymore
@BarackObama Please elaborate
@BarackObama people need work now.  The Hoover Dam wasn't long-term work, yet contributed to the economy then just as the pipeline will now.
@BarackObama Only under a tyrant is such a conclusion relevant. In a free society, citizens invest in projects on their own criteria.
@BarackObama You have destroyed our country
@BarackObama Thank you!!
@BarackObama 
@Humbertom842H

@BarackObama thank you for making the right choice in rejecting the #KeystoneXL pipeline
@BarackObama Are you talking about the pipeline or your presidency????
@BarackObama lies
@BarackObama great
@BarackObama - Why do you hate the Nation's economy so much? #socialism
Like the Dickens RT @bhoblows: @BarackObama - Why do you hate the Nation's economy so much? #socialism
@BarackObama 
We just need to get back to drilling thats all that matters some lower class ppl or bless to work in the oil field
@BarackObama @BernieBrigade Neither would ISDS part of TPP
@BarackObama penis i know non of this
@BarackObama   14 more months. That's all I'm saying. #NotSoonEnough
@BarackObama 
Yeah butucould make a contributionby taking on China's assault on US Aluminum instead of doing nothing
@BarackObama oh by the way do your homework. Cattle is 51% of the emissions put off in this world. Conspiracy i smell.
@BarackObama people need to do your research on Barack Obama let's see your birth certificate Barack
@BarackObama Big mistake
@BarackObama , the Obama administration acts like they don't even have to go through the government to get anything done I call that a tyran
@BarackObama knows that #KeystoneXL  isn't a distraction, but it is an insue of safety that the American people are concerned about.
@BarackObama In other words: "There would likely be a GOP pres when completed, and I wouldn't want them to get credit."
@BarackObama Yeah, after 7 years of Obamanomics this country is in real good shape. WHATEVER!!!!!!
@BarackObama only wish your administration would have positive meaningful & long lasting impact on our US economy. #sigh #economicgrowth
@BarackObama are you insane your Digging us into a hole the keystone pipeline could have the potential to boost our economy.
@BarackObama neither do you but here you are
@BarackObama Dont be scared of our enemy. The enemy are not gods, we can kill them quicker and faster.
@BarackObama That's asinine. Every drop that we don't have to import from SW Asia and/or pull from our reserves contributes meaningfully
@BarackObama No, your right, but torus generators would change the world over night. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lEV5AFFcZ-s …
@BarackObama thank God you're out of our house next year! Congrats on being the worst POTUS ever !
@BarackObama l never thought I would long for the days of Jimmy Carter.
@BarackObama Thank you!!!!!!!
@BarackObama HOBAMA IS REAL #HOBAMA

@BarackObama Thank You from Nebraska!!!!
@BarackObama ok.
@BarackObama thank u ! not just 4  #keystonepipeline decision -opportunity to look authentically at the world and lead on #climatechange
Well, I'm shocked - it appears @BarackObama doesn't write his own tweets!
@BarackObama , Dear Mr.President.. You promised  America change. Still you talk about what you can do rather than what you have done.
@BarackObama Keep in mind that the oil still continue to be delivered into the US through our waterways, instead of a pipe.
@BarackObama Explain "meaningful"  and "longterm" to workers that are out of jobs and could benefit now, from it. YK
@YULANDAJONES 32 jobs listed? Explained.
@BarackObama u r right
@BarackObama #correct
@BarackObama As opposed to "Cash For Clunkers"???
@BarackObama he's absolutely right. It would cost jobs. In the shipping industry. And if there was an hole in it. And no one knew about it.
@BarackObama they'd end up paying the bill for years. Like in cancer deaths and mutant people and healthcare costs.
@BarackObama ýyyyyyyyoooooouuuu
@BarackObama okay
@BarackObama I love you as a president
@BarackObama nothing you have done in your time in the White House has helped the economy and I am an independent voter.
@BarackObama self made thunder canalize it simple same technik diagram of clouds . 
@BarackObama Not according to people living in the Northern States that were looking forward to the jobs!
@barackobama FETULLAH GÜLEN ABD NİN GİZLİ SIRLARINI DEAŞLA PAYLAŞIYOR.
@barackobama SAYIN OBAMA SİZDEN TEK BİR RİCAM VAR FETULLAH GÜLENİ BİZE TESLİM EDİN. BU ADAMA ASLA GÜVENMEYİN. SİZLERİN TELEFONUNUZU DİNLİYOR
@BarackObama But using hydrogen to fuel our cars will!
@BarackObama no but it  will certainly stuff the pockets of a few rich old white dudes. And isn't that what America's all about anyway?
@BarackObama Those communities that have been involved in the pipeline are losing jobs that were projected to provide 30 years of work.
@BarackObama  You are not for this country WHY you have gained from this country.
@BarackObama ola boa tarde.
@BarackObama General comments by Obama on keystone like to hear hard facts why he is against line but that's like waiting on Christmas !!
@BarackObama This Native American/NDN & Goldwater Republican says THANK YOU Answered today Job well doneBless youBless Us All
@BarackObama  so many blind ppl. You still use oil, just instead of local jobs, give payment to obamas cousins overseas
@BarackObama finally we agree on something... that's a start
@BarackObama Pipelines are simply a delivery method and a superior one to rail in cost and safety. #KeystoneXL would be more efficient.
@BarackObama Wrong again. Would provide quite a few jobs and not just fast food type like you have helped on. Again Gov. cannot creat jobs
@BarackObama Thank you for rejecting #KeystoneXL! Now NJ needs to be protected from @ChrisChristie 's Pinelands pipeline!
@BarackObama I think America stolen enough Petrol from Iraq..it will be enough for next 40 years for America...
@BarackObama Thank you, Mr. President!
@BarackObama @SenTedCruz @POTUS Did anyone else notice @POTUS stumbled every time he said the words "climate change"...
@BarackObama Neither does a family opening up a small bakery. But it's business and keeps people active and happy. You made a mistake today
@BarackObama great decision, mr. President!
@BarackObama Aye bruh, you're gonna have to run again. If I have to pick out of these candidates, I'm just gonna write you in. #Obama2016

@BarackObama Mr President, give it the weekend. Sit back, kick ur feet up, and watch some ball. In my opinion, u deserve it. #BestPrezEver
@BarackObama How wrong. It would create many jobs for our citizens and lessen our overseas dependency.
@BarackObama やっぱりはっきりしろと言うことですね！
