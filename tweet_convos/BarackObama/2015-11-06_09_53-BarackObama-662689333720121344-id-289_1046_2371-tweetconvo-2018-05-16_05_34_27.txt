@BarackObama we won't mention all the other pipeline projects that apparently were okay while he and his buddy Warren fought climate change
@BarackObama more potential for accidents transporting fuel over roads, rails & sea than #KeystoneXL
@BarackObama your use of dirty oil from Alberta is a joke when Californian oil is much dirtier. As a Canadian and Albertan its goodbye USA.
@BarackObama keep using diesel fuel to transport oil instead of #KeystoneXL , makes sense for #ActOnClimate
@BarackObama wow, part of your #CriminalJusticeReform was to employ criminals. They could've worked on #KeystoneXL
@BarackObama the president just rejected jobs for Americans and energy independence. Way to go @POTUS worst president ever!

@BarackObama this president doesn't want to do anything to help Americans
@BarackObama -Enemy-in-Chief is wrong.  We need president who's FOR the people, NOT AGAINST. We have incompetent IDIOTS running our Country.
@BarackObama Good job Mr. President! And great job on prison reform!!! Now we need to figure out a solution to the violence here in Chicago
@dagaldemsugar @BarackObama - The solution is to vote in local elections. Hold your mayor and governor accountable. Vote them out of office.
