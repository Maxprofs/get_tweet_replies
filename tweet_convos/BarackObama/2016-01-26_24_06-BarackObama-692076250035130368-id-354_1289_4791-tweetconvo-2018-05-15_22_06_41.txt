@BarackObama http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/26/big-pharmas-worst-nightmare?CMP=twt_gu …
@BarackObama thx President Obama, I luv my health care.
@BarackObama they only gained that healthcare because you didn't give them a choice.
@BarackObama Yep my premiums more than doubled before you cancelled me for not being a United States citizen! Thanks for your new program!!
@BarackObama I'm fighting with you Mr President!
@BarackObama should be happy that many people are beginning to think this is the new "normal".
@BarackObama can't stop We need socialized government provided medicine! Next president needs to pick this back up!
@BarackObama someone should remind him that there is almost 400 million people in the U.S.
@BarackObama I'd love to help but can't do much until either $$ assist guidelines change.Was on Medicaid & lost it when Obamacare started.

@BarackObama @vcadenilla
@BarackObama it has also increased my premiums by 28% in the last 3 years...prior to your help it was only increasing by an average of 2%
@BarackObama and screwed multi millions more
@BarackObama I bet this doesn't net out the millions that LOST healthcare because of Obamacare.
@BarackObama Trump wins presidency #wtf
@BarackObama at exorbitant prices.
@BarackObama It has hurt millions more. Who do YOU think paid for it.  Not you, because we pay your health  insurance too
Marge Robison@MargeRobison @BarackObama I make $1100 a month on disability and my Medicaid spend down each month is $600 how is that fair?
@BarackObama none of those people can get oral surgery, MS medicine without drama , and a host of other BASIC health necessities.
@BarackObama Obamacare forced millions out of health insurance plans & made treatment impossible b/c of costs. Obama is making millions ill.
@BarackObama you have done the US citizens an immense favor by granting then the healthcare security they deserved.
@BarackObama it's helped my family
@BarackObama Wow, the fantasy life continues!  Barry will probably even use these fake statistics on his tombstone! @GOP @tedcruz
@BarackObama And my middle class butt is now paying over 17.6% more for insurance than i was when this non sense started! #ThanksObama #ugh

@BarackObama  It only helped your non-contributing, free loading, voter base.
@BarackObama I wonder how accurate this is
@BarackObama Only because they were forced to purchase this crappy insurance
@BarackObama yeah because you forced everyone to buy a plan or else pay tax penalties. Explain freedom again please?
@BarackObama haha. What a fraud...people in Sweden laughs at u!!
@BarackObama Dear President Obama. Please continue to make health care more affordable to individuals and employers!!!
