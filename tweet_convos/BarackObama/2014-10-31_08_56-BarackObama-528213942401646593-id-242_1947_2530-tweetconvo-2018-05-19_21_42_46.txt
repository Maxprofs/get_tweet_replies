@BarackObama first will give independence to them.
@BarackObama @PaulNemitz Great idea! How about ensuring equal pay for those women who do pursue those career paths? #WomenSucceed
@LuxeChronicles @BarackObama @PaulNemitz we have had an equal pay act since the 1960's, it is illegal to pay a woman less for the same work,
@BarackObama I think the problem is equal pay and better treatment/opportunities not so much lack of motivation.

.@BarackObama @curtrice  for those who choose to stay home & raise their children themselves as hands-on parents.
@TheOtherRosie But as a working parent, I can assure you that having a career does not = "hands-off" parenting.
.@BarackObama @curtrice Mr.Obama seems to think that raising children & taking care of a home is not #REAL #WORK, #NECESSARY, or #REWARDING
@TheOtherRosie That seems to read a lot into this. Encouraging "A" says nothing about "B," as far as I can see.
@barackobama very good gesture obama spread the message
.@BarackObama Yes let's do more than encourage.  Let's talk strategies, mechanisms, plans, etc.  @susanmvickers #WomenSucceed
@BarackObama As a HS STEM teacher & a scientist, I see encouragement as less a problem than retention; women & girls are leaving b/c sexism.
@BarackObama you have had a bully pulpit to help inner city youth for 6 years and have done jack this is all crap
