@BarackObama Unfortunately the economy of the Black Community hasn't felt that impact. It's never a good economy unless it impacts all!!
@RibConnection @BarackObama Unfortunately the blacks want you to GIVE them everything. I notice when they loot, it isn't the welfare office
@verydarkeyes45 @RibConnection that's a generalisation. Imagine if blacks perpetuated the myth that white people all wear Crocs! #scary
@ScottyDotCom @RibConnection Hardly in the same context, I am white and never wore crocs in my life. Point was no welfare office burns down
@verydarkeyes45 @RibConnection lies all white people wear Crocs, they are trashy & we all know white people can't dress/no fashion
@ScottyDotCom @RibConnection Horsefeathers!! If I SAID I have never wore crocs, then I haven't.  Who is saying whites differ from black? Boo
@BarackObama where are these jobs and why am I having a hard time getting one? I'm a veteran and Army spouse with education and still no job
