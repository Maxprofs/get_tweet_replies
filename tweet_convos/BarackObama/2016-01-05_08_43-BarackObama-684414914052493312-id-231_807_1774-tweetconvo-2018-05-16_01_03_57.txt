@BarackObama Give up your armed guards for you, your wife and and your girls. Then, maybe, I will listen to you. But you won't, right?
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse   Here's one!  Try enforcing existing laws that cover the problems!!
@BarackObama End gun violence by ending the cause of people becoming angry, poor and deprived. End capitalism.
@OfficialSPGB @BarackObama I'm trying to think of a socialist nation that worked and then......there are none
@helpingtheigno1 There’s reason for that.
@OfficialSPGB because it can't be don't because the ambition of each individual varies from person to person making no socialism broken
@helpingtheigno1 @OfficialSPGB ok
@BarackObama Limiting law abiding citizens from obtaining guns doesn't make us safer. Criminals don't obey gun laws

@BarackObama
The Apathy of American public is biggest obstacle to change @BarackObama not gun lobby! People could bring about change if they cared enough

@BarackObama go O--you da man
@BarackObama # And all the Executive orders Obama is good at can be stopped as soon as a Republican is Elected.
@BarackObama You demanded that governors do what they need to do to keep the public safe, yet YOU force them to take in possible terrorist?
@BarackObama great discourse
@BarackObama Just curious but why are you crying talking about Chicago and they have more unregistered guns?
@BarackObama Your not getting a ban on assault rifles and your executive order won't eliminate gun violence.
@BarackObama # And Obama does not have time to work with Congress to pass laws it would take away from Golf time.
@BarackObama Thank You for doing something

@BarackObama congrats Mr.president
@BarackObama está diciendo verdades como puños así se forja el futuro de EEUU
@BarackObama i agree
@BarackObama translation: you lack enough skill and cred to pass laws Constitutionally so you'll just play Queen for next 360 days. Creep.
@BarackObama Pakistan always use USA aid for terrorism in India. For Pakistan  aid should be close for peaceful community in South Asia.
Time for the annual control grab. Congrats on being the best gun salesman of all time. @BarackObama @WhiteHouse
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse if I was selling guns I wouldn't want to be the blame for some retard shooting up people! It simple to me!
@BarackObama Thank you Mr. President.
@BarackObama free mental health care? Raising minimum wage to reduce poverty? Holding the media accountable for glorifying gun violence?
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse why don't you help those in need. . . None of what you suggest is going to work
