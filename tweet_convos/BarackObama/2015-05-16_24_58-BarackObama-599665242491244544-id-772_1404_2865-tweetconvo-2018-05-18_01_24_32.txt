@BarackObama That place will exist only after we raise taxes. Again. And again and ...
@robmtaub @BarackObama Wow, let us allow the poor to become poorer; no matter how hard the families try to stay above water.
@trmmosher @BarackObama If tax dollars actually went to those families I'd be all for it.
@robmtaub @BarackObama Thing is, there are families who have to choose to pay bills or put food on the table.The system has many flaws.
@trmmosher @robmtaub @BarackObama that choice is due to: not living within their means, and making babies when they can't afford it.
@TylersVoice2You @SMknightSM @robmtaub @BarackObama Our son is a bilateral amputee and has 2-5surgeries a yr.The only help we get is for him
