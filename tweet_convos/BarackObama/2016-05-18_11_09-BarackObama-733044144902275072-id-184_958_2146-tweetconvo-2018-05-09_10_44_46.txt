Re: Washroom issue. Did Obama do this to please his wife?
@USDOL that would be a great idea, when ever it happens. Cost of living is rising but pay is lowering.

Another reason to send jobs to China
@BarackObama
@USDOL 8 years after you take office you decide that the overtime pay is not correct that's a bunch of bullshit

@BarackObama before republicans put them in the soup line like 2008!
what about the single moms that have been working for a company for years and r over the 47,000 mark???
Great idea!
Great idea.
@USDOL 
So there's a law for overtime but social security recipient's don't get cost of living adjustment

Overtime? Most people can't get 40 hours thanks to Obamascare. We need good jobs. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
..."After 5 yers I now understand what the Republicans had been trying to tell me all those years."
...After he was "retired" from Congress he opened a Bed and Breakfast....cont'd
George McGovern admitted that he and the Democrats were clueless about how businesses really work....cont'd
The unintended conseuences will be that corps will let full timers go and hire part timers OR h2b workers you genius!
@SenSanders great job fighting for this Senator Sanders!!!

This is going to have HUGE implications!  $$$$$$. #cripplehighereducation
@USDOL What about Student Loans???????
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse Yay!!
@BarackObama you mean millions of people will be laid off or earn less due to schedule reductions. You're so clueless.
@USDOL lol, so i have worked this job for 18 years just to make $49,000. With no ot pay. Now you make the max 47,???.  Thanks!!
@USDOL wish you'd find this before I was fired. Forced into that situation by policies that favour corps.

@BarackObama @USDOL I see hours cut for workers and people being replaced by part timers...not good!
@BarackObama @USDOL ever hear the phrase "you don't have permission to work overtime?"  yeah.  Let's expand that....idiots.
@BarackObama @USDOL Reagan's trickle down economics was a piss pour idea
@USDOL what about Social Security?
Here's exactly how this will play out and end up penalizing workers.. https://www.allthink.com/1268306 
 In Boston, we're trying to talk Big Papi into staying 1 more year w/the Red Sox. Can we talk you into staying, too?
@BarackObama how does it work with the food and beverage industry. On record I only make $2.30 an hour and dont make overtime
@BarackObama no tengo trabajo yo
great but it really should be higher than $47,000. It isn't right to give someone 60 hours of work and demand it be done in 40!
this law does nothing except cut hours and salaries
There was another Black Death in police custody. Do we matter? You went against a bathroom law but not against police brutality
today's goal must be to ruin small business. Obama proves his ignorance again.
False promises and promotion of another expansion of the government instead of expanded the liberty of the people.
@USDOL And this will do what to keep jobs in the U.S.?
you are exceeding your authority again and Congress should act to stop you!
@USDOL Ridiculous claim
@USDOL what a ridiculous PR stunt.  More and more Americans working 2 and 3 part-time jobs.  Where's the OT in that? DIVERSION.
; The talking points have been released. Biden, Warren and now the WH. Force companies and mass layoffs will follow. Zero plans
but @POTUS ..... @UncleBlazer
nothing fair about this govt. everything is by force can't wait till Obama is gone and Hillary is in jail
Problematic for intern programs at big professional firms whose corporate culture supports extended hours at the same pay.
what about the military pay as well ???? The military member & the families struggle & suffer to get by
@FlaDems We've favored corporations over workers & consumers for a long time & it hasn't helped Americans or the economy.
@USDOL
How about we cut Congress, HOR, and Senators pay.  Make them survive on 36k a year, and pay their own benefits! #useless
Shouldn't this be done by Congress?  You are not our king.
congress does not do crap stinky or not.
Yes, that's a problem, too.
what's the executive branch of the constitutionally based federal govt got to do with this.  Ridiculous.

違法憲法の糞日本の国家権力には、何を言っても無駄です。国民は人間扱いされていません。大統領の方から直に日本の国家権力に雷を落として下さい。もはや、私は確実に殺される方に向かっています。
Can;t wait to see how many more "part time" employees this will create. #jobkiller
@pathos408 @USDOL..overreach of presidential power.
You are not a King. We had a revolutionary war to depose our last King.
How many jobs do u think people can reasonably have at one time?  BO how many jobs did u ever juggle? People already have 2-3
good way to incentivize employers to cut more manpower and hours. What else can you do to 'encourage' recession?
Im Sure you make good money and Work 50-60 hours a week just like people that make 30K
Link is not opening up
wish this woulda happened when I was working 60 hrs for 40 hrs pay
SAM loses hours and pay = screwed, but he has more time to job, but can't afford to pay rent.
Video highlights 2 choices for Mattie. WRONG! Realistic choice #3 is Mattie is let go because business A can't afford new rule!
.@WhiteHouse your economics are a joke
@ParkerMolloy I'm going to forward this to our President & HR just to make them squirm.
@USDOL This will greatly impact the nursing profession.It will also impact the quality of care for pts.
Saudi Arabia intend to buy weapons identical to those used by the Syrian Arab Army to fabricate false dirty stories.
@WhiteHouse
Many workers are working part time and some do not have work at all. Congress is out of step with what's happening to workers.
@USDOL this is huge!!!
@USDOL You people should remember that you don't make the "rules" or "laws". Obama is not the " King". There are 3 gov branches.
And the giant #sucking sound...
@USDOL 99% of your Workforce is part time how are they going to get overtime. This President is so darn dumb.
not true.
