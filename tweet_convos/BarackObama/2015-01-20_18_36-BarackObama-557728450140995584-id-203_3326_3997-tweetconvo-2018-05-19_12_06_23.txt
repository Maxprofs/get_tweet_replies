@BarackObama yeah while us tax payers have to pay for their education you are pathetic
@BarackObama if implemented, what stops employers from raising the bar to requiring a graduate degree for the jobs of the future?
@BarackObama I love the idea of giving more people a shot. I just worry that it could cost more on the long run. Graduate credits cost more.

@BarackObama WTG!!! Mr.President #IAmPOTUS
@BarackObama How about a plan to stop the financial bleeding of our poor Children that will go broke with your spending?
@BarackObama @MiaFarrow The cost is not "zero" for the taxpayers. If high schools did their jobs, we wouldn't need subsidized comm. college.
@BigKahuna919191 @BarackObama What are you even talking about?
@BigKahuna919191 @BarackObama Bush fucked up public school - not Obama
@okenquist @BigKahuna919191 @BarackObama agreed @BigKahuna919191 Americans don't need free CCs. No one appreciates free things It won't help
@BigKahuna919191 @okenquist @BarackObama also it's also not the American way. Here you earn your share and not have it given to you.
@BarackObama I am NOT paying for other people's community college.  I need to save money to send my only daughter to a 4 year #SingleParent
@BarackObama
@BarackObama wow.  Suck it founding fathers, schooled!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Great idea but how will this be funded?  This will have to be an additional burden of $50 billion a year or more.
@BarackObama Yes please
@BarackObama Bravo, Mr. President!
@BarackObama shame of u
@BarackObama yes for Americans interest not for next election.that it's
@BarackObama @Dr_fawazAljidie

@BarackObama: "That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college—to zero." —President Obama #SOTU

@BarackObama @sanzotopia so does that mean my community college debt will be voided?
@BarackObama American college and university may be established in Telangana ,India
@BarackObama @AngelRiamirez does it start next year because i graduate this year lol
@BarackObama I get the idea behind this, but people need to have the motivation to actually attend your free college. #stophandouts
“@BarackObama: "That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college—to zero." #SOTU” AMEN!!!
@BarackObama great idea we are just scarred congress will not do the right thing
@BarackObama What about us parents 80,000 in debt for loans we have already helped our children with for 4 year university? Break?
@BarackObama That would be great if I could go for free, it'd really help out, it would help out many others too I'm sure.
@BarackObama @TheBabicki cant wait

@BarackObama
“@BarackObama: "That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college—to zero.” @g2thelove
@BarackObama and that's why community colleges are changing their names to state colleges.  Loop hole
@BarackObama @JanelleMonae Do it before Spring!!!!!
@BarackObama @Beaniee410 How is this Community College going to pay your step father for teaching at it? Better yet WHO will pay?
“@BarackObama: "That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college—to zero." —Obama” YAAASS
@BarackObama @JanelleMonae to bad he wants to tax 529 plans.
@BarackObama since it's being discussed can you make college in general cody $0 that'd be clutch
@BarackObama Sooo...who is going to pay for the influx of students trying to get an education and the repercussions of that influx?

Uh oh! Looks like President @BarackObama’s at it again, trying to help people afford education, healthcare and life. He’s worse than Hitler!
@GoGetMyCoffee tweeting AND presenting the #SOTU. Damn... The guys can multi-task! That should be discussed.
@BarackObama hey bud whos gonna pay for that?
@jake_randle1 oh tru free education suxxxxx #KeepTheLowerClassLOW #LadiesAmIRight
@lizsaenz23 we already get free education (high school) and if you work hard enough you can get free college education through scholarships
@jake_randle1 hahahah scholarships are limited and a lot of people can't afford tuition and it's not about not working hard
@lizsaenz23 you just reinforced my point. People cant afford tuition...so they should work hard, get good grades, then they can
@lizsaenz23 get scholarships so they don't have to pay tuition
.@BarackObama what about already suffering CC adjuncts who can't afford childcare...or food? #CommunityCollege #SOTU

Right, but are we allowed to get in on the free college also? We all want the chance at a better paying job.  RT @Sirachee @BarackObama

@BarackObama that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of
@BarackObama I know many people can use the break to get ahead.
The most impressive thing about this #SOTU is the fact that @BarackObama is apparently live-tweeting it under the podium.
@iamchrisbarlow you're not serious right? If you're not being sarcastic then he has a team to so that for him. If you are I'm dumb :P
@BarackObama "Let's get it done".
