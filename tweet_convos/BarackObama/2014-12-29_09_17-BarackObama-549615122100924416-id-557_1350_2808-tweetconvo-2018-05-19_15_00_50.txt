And then? MT @BarackObama "I won't stop fighting for the American people until the day I leave this office."
@pastordan @BarackObama then he is gonna rest. He has endured sustained bullying the likes of which no other pres has EVER faced
@nika7k @pastordan @BarackObama it's sad how people blame him for everything when congress, state, and Senate has WAY more power than him.
@JessYoMama @pastordan @BarackObama yep. Its plain old pedestrian racism
@nika7k @pastordan @BarackObama to do what he wants to do because he's not a republican
@JessYoMama @pastordan @BarackObama i dont think so. They ARE obstreperous in the extreme but this is worst ive seen
