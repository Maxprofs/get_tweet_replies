@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I'm one of them. Thank you.
@8katelove Why didn't you have health insurance before?
@UriBlago Why do you ask?
@8katelove Because I'm curious to know if you could've purchased a plan before Obamacare. 

Also, do you qualify for a subsidy?
@WhiteHouse @TheRevAl Obamacare is a tax.Period. only the big pharmaceutical co. And rich benefit. Once again, the people get screwed.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  AMEN! CONGRATS OBAMA!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama A thank you gift for all you do

@kbaileyphoto @WhiteHouse  I agree. The Obama health insure help Americans wallets and also give peace of mind to working classes Americans.
@lizaizzy1924 @WhiteHouse when I was working full time as an intern it was the only way to get health insurance affordable and good coverage

@WhiteHouse Bravo
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama wonderful!
@WhiteHouse @RiskyLiberal Could have spent the last four years making ACA work better than trying to sabotaging it at every turn.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @jessica_tillson 
@colsontrace trace your an idiot. Who do you think is paying for all that insurance? Companies sure as hell aren't giving it for free
@jessica_tillson @colsontrace previous president George W. Bush (republican) so instead of helping you just don't a shit and could care less
@KRob7818 @colsontrace why should I give my hard earned tax money to pay for a lazy piece of crap that sits on their butt?
@jessica_tillson @colsontrace YOLO
@KRob7818 @colsontrace hey krob, speaking of debt, your precious jewel of a pres has collected more debt than every other president combined

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yeah and ppl who pay for it their deductables and Co pays increased dramatically to pay for ur greeloaders.
@WhiteHouse because you canceled they're coverage. Then forced 6-8 million of them to buy your expensive, shitty coverage.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton everyone should be covered for healthcare. Civilised society should be compassionate. Makes economic sense too.
@WhiteHouse @VOTE_HILLARY can't believe anyone would not want this to happen! #Obamacare
@WhiteHouse Tried but it was worse than the sliding scale in the public hospital here called HHC Options. No premium, just pay when u r sick

@WhiteHouse More Americans are paying premiums but can't afford the deductibles required to see their physician #SOTU2015 #Obamacare
@WhiteHouse Excellent! If only SCOTUS hadnt allowed states to opt out of medicaid expansion there'd be millions more. Shame on them
@WhiteHouse Thank you, President Obama!
@WhiteHouse  still took our taxes even after saying it was a different type of tax credit still took our taxes after we got health care
@WhiteHouse We gained health care coverage through lies and deceit and fear of what would happen to us if we didn't get it
@WhiteHouse @InSouthFlorida Yeah they can't afford the high deductibles...but they've got Health Insurance.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that's amazing and we're here to make a difference!
@WhiteHouse let us now work on getting costs down
@WhiteHouse @MathisDeneise This is a great part of this president's legacy.

@WhiteHouse @ryansmith0212 my insurance costs doubled thanks to this crazy president
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama

@WhiteHouse Mat wat child is being withheld by an Australian family lknown to the the Bush's as a threat to peodifile soldier child
@WhiteHouse @Yahoo it sucks! Costs way more than before, higher deductible so freaking insurance doesn't even pay! You call that coverage?!?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama society focuses on the negatives

@WhiteHouse liars
