@Everytown @BarackObama this is so ridiculous. A complete joke. Get your celebrity idiot pals to make a video to stop ISIS
@Everytown @BarackObama For whats it worth, nice but does not help. stop buying guns that will help, for safety use tasers.
@Everytown @BarackObama END GUN VIOLENCE BY CHARGING TEN DOLLARS PER BULLETT
@Everytown @BarackObama ye we can
@Everytown funny...many of those Hollywood hypocrites get paid for their violent movies...hmm
@Everytown it isn't right that representatives of a free people insist on disarming their masters. That is the foundation of #2A #tyranny
@Everytown Libtard "sheeple" will get us all killed. #StandUpAmerica against gun grabbers! #2ndAmendment protects us FROM Government! #tcot
@Everytown Did I miss the part where they promised never to use armed bodyguards again?
.@Everytown Hollywood nitwit pod people.  Freaking hypocrites with armed security and I'm not allowed to protect myself?  Fuck you.
Wow @Everytown. I am persuaded by your reasoned arguments and grasp of the constitutional nuances associated with your positions.
@Everytown @BarackObama  do not stray from Do! Always bad things happen! Always!
@Everytown @JuddApatow Since when was Hollywood a moral guide for human behaviour.

#EndDroneViolence

#EndGovernmentViolence

#EndHyprocracyViolence
@Everytown @BarackObama Gun violence will end when you get people off of poverty and drugs and bring jobs back to this country!
@Everytown @BarackObama @3zarmom
@Everytown @SofiaVergara Not any of the #gunlaws in CA or proposed new ones would have stopped #SanBernadinoShooting #Not1
@Everytown Stop the gun lobby funding politicians
@Everytown @SofiaVergara So dissapointed in you.  That you would join this.
@Everytown @BarackObama making a video will not end anything. You need to ban and buy back guns, simple, we did it in Australia.
@Everytown Naive idiots.
@Everytown @JuddApatow Best movie I have seen in ages Should be on every big screen in every town. I nominate this for an EMMY Great job e1
@Everytown @AmySchumerBoobs If you really want ant to end gun violence in America, you need to get rid of illegal drugs first
@Everytown So, what's ur plan to remove ILLEGAL gun owners? None? Huh!
@Everytown @BarackObama that sucks
@Everytown Trust me, 100M+ angry Americans who respect tradition and self reliance stand between you and your dystopian bullshit
@Everytown @JuddApatow Regardless of sides I wonder how many folks debating gun issues have been involved in actual gun violence? Curiosity?
@Everytown let's drop the guns and love one another instead
@Everytown So does this mean they're going to give up their armed security & stop making movies that promote violence? #Hypocrisy #tcot #2A
@Everytown @BarackObama bacon can't produce a movie without guns killing all the actors notice all the people in vid all nobodies!!
@Everytown @BarackObama. Sofia is in! It was a good experience. How about a Compromise? Only pass gun control laws with a 365 day sunsetPls
@Everytown I thought movies & video games were what CAUSED the violence, now you're asking them to be on your side? See anything odd there?
@Everytown @BarackObama.  Yeah get the thugs off the streets. That will end gun violence.
@Everytown @BarackObama 
But in India more then America.
@Everytown ...yeah, because everyone listens to arrogant, self-absorbed celebs & all their experience on the subject. Not.
@Everytown Forward this to Hollywood to do not produce violent movies.... Anyway nice move
@Everytown If you really want to reduce gun violence ask dear leader to resign.
@Everytown @BarackObama http://theyouthjob.com/?ref=173571 
@Everytown @BarackObama we can stop actors and actresses from making millions . They talk about gun valance but are in movies  with guns.
@Everytown Well then... that should do it...

Who knew it was so simple... let's start by disarming ALL of your body guards...
@Everytown @BarackObama I see paid actors whose sole job is to brainwash us into giving up gun rights. Is this Nazi Germany?

@ReeFungorio @Everytown, those People, especially AK47 and AR 15 which seem so popular with both domestic and international terrorists.
@Everytown @BarackObama there's no way to stop somebody from getting a gun. Arms sales are up I have the right to protect myself
@Everytown @BarackObama we have so many problems when is Obama going to deal with the real issues you spend billions overseas but we have
@Everytown @BarackObama take the guns out of movies and off TV, if you are so passionate about it.
@Everytown @BarackObama Pretty Sure this is the dumbest #unamerican #liberal #movement in History #Infidel #Problems
@Everytown @amyschumer "we can end" the slow dissolution of our Constitution and inalienable given birth rights!
