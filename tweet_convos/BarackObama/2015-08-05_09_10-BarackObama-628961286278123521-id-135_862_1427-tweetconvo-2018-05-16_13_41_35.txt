@BarackObama SORRY, YOURE NOT CONVINCING ANYBODY THAT YOUR HORRIBLE DEAL IS GOOD. JUST RESIGN AND LET AN ADULT RENEGOTIATE A DEAL WITH IRAN.
@BarackObama This i do understand
@BarackObama and the decision not to intervene with the civil war in Syria.
@BarackObama More than a decade later, we still live w/ the consequences of the decision to invade Normandy, France.

@barackobama God bless u.. #IranDeal
@BarackObama And the consequences of pulling out way way too soon.  Let the blame lie where it should #POTUS.
@stormnnorm @BarackObama Wrong, Bush signed the agreement on pull out and Obama just stuck with the agreement.
@LRAraiza Wrong.  He could have and was asked to extend by the military and Iraq leadership. @BarackObama
@stormnnorm @LRAraiza @BarackObama Iraqi government turned down his request & advice to leave troops there. Typical GOP revisionist history
@WaltMerritt27 Not the case.  He was given an opportunity to come up with a plan that works for both.  He didn't. @LRAraiza @BarackObama
@BarackObama We also still live with the cause. Capitalism.
