It'll be funny when Trump gets his know-nothing ass kicked in Nov & then refuses to give a concession speech like a big baby
PUT DOWN THE PIPE AND BACK AWAY FROM IT! YOU and the "Damocrats" really need see what "We the People" are gonna do
Whoa! Oh shit! Damocrats? Oh dammmmnnn. I have to admit, that really stung.
The "Truth" only hurts those it has to! Would "Dumbocrats" be less insulting to you and more fitting?
Wow. Too harsh. I feel wounded.
SORRY, time wounds all heals. LOL
you are blessed Sir
@OFA -WORST president!
@OFA I wish they would hold hearings and vote no so you'd shut up about it
Write your congress people, Mike.
@OFA Well said, Mr. President.
@OFA The "People" won't stand for a "rushed thru" appointee! An appointment will be delayed until the Republicans take over.
Happy birthday to my inspiration
seems a vote is not necessary I think their actions scream NO. Give it up Barack
“YES, WE NEED ACTION” http://easycolorexpress.com

Quit crying, get you junk packed up and get ready to get your fanny out of our White House! You will NOT be missed!
@OFA ....president trump already stated he will take care of this issue barry...
they won't fund Zika research, they won't give Garland a hearing -- anyone else would lose his/her job for non-performance.
@OFA Thakur manish rana
.@BarackObama @potus @joelgrey @joebiden why hasnt JudgeGarland spoken for himself, asking for some friends

@OFA Judge Bork!!!!!
every american should have their individual liberty respected. #EndTheDrugWar. speak out #Liberty #Justice #BodilyAutonomy
@OFA 
No chance fool
Judge Garland and all the other appointments should be appointed by @BarackObama since the Senate has abrogated its Constitutional duty.
@OFA no way
You are the head on a very corrupt snake Mr. Obama. The truth will find you out. The Light will always prevail over you.

he will when you leave office, then he will get a fair hearing.
Then give him a down vote just to shut you the HELL up!!!
If Hillary wins the presidency the GOP will likely put Garland thru as he is a better choice than what she would nominate.
@OFA
@OFA @JohnCornyn  hold the vote for Garland, now.
just send him over to the court as a "voting intern."
@OFA
@OFA Yes I know he should
Fair? @BarackObama? Is it FAIR what ur buddy #Satanyahu does in #Palestine? Is it fair #US taxpayers pay 4 genocide?
@OFA No, Bo.
We don't need another politically correct, left wing extremist on the bench. Trump will get us a better choice.
@BarackObama
NO TO GARLAND!!!  Garland is Anti-2nd Amendment who will take away MORE that your gun RIGHTS!
While I do not agree with many of your positions, I do agree with this one; Garland should be afforded a vote.
.@BarackObama Quack.
november bro
Barack Obamaさん

◯◯ should get a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote from .

Thank you very much

@BarackObama #DoYourJob #Senate
No.  He shouldn't.
He should not get a hearing, he sucks as bad as you do. @SenateGOP #DoYourJob & wait until 2017!
@Nikluk @OFA. Nah. Wait for Hillary to appoint a more liberal judge. Remove Merrick from consideration ASAP.
@OFA 
http://Facebook.com/veteransforpoliticalreform …
can you not issue an Executive Order and get it down. This is dreadful.
@OFA La paz es necesaria, una propuesta respetuosa ayudaría mucho. Veremos el progreso y opinaré nuevamente.
Senate needs to remember who put them in and who can take them out of the Senate.
@OFA So why R Senators above any Law? Who disciplines the Senators Not doing their Job?
REPUBLICANS EVEN BACK TRUMP & Putin. I believe both trump GOP & Putin all in bed 
Together, that's borders on communism
@OFA He visto mejoría,  debe involucrarse en proceso de paz, usando su talento por el bien común, tengo fe en su progreso.!
The Senate needs to get off their butts and do their duty just as I always do...living up to my oath

America deserved a fair hearing against @HillaryClinton but the fix was in. Now your campaigning on our tax $'s Unacceptable.
@OFA yes he should
Why dont you shame the coup of Gulen in Turkey? Let me guess, you are one of the big part of this game.
@OFA Tifferny said Always Love. My Arms powered by Honda Toyota.Like A mothers Touch.
Thank you Mr. President..!! Mr. 4th Quarter.!! @JEDBLACKCORP
Republicans should make this deal for Garland before Hillary is elected.
Judge Garland should get a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote from the Senate. Speak out. http://ofa.bo/2aDY78a  #DoYourJob
@OFA you don't get to request fairness when u are supporting a Dem nominee & party that rigged election. #DNCLeaks
this is not reddit. u are el presidente. You are allowed to draw attention to things that are Pissing you off, directly. Speak.
Joe told us not to during an election year.
the Senate should be fired for not doing their jobs, at every other job this would happen. So why not in the Senate?
…says HYPOCRITE @BarackObama, who along with Biden, Clinton, +,

Recalling times when @realDonaldTrump used to tweet me about @BarackObama not being transparent. Tax returns Donald?
He was obviously trying to piggyback on your fame to get more Twitter followers
Anybody else rather have four more years of Obama than having Clinton or Trump as our president?
