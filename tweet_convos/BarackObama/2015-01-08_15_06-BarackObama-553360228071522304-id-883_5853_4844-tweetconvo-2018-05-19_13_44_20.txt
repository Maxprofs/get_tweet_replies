@EvilEsq 
1. Tax increases by EO
2. student loan forgiveness
3. Free Comm College
4. restrictions on IRA and 401K's
Our glorious future.
@EvilEsq My fav on the 401k and IRAs scheme he's gonna spring.... HE has determined how much money is needed for the avg Joe's retirement!
Yeah, Barack had the actuaries on the Death Panel at HHS compute the amount average Joe's will need for retirement @bayareahausfrau.
@EvilEsq Naturally, it will exclude himself, as he is no average Joe. His Royal Arrogance will have all the luxuries money can buy.
Barack's deal with Iran is that they won't build ICBM with enough range to hit Hawaii @bayareahausfrau.
@EvilEsq That's some deal. Very nuanced, right?
Nothing would surprise me Frau @bayareahausfrau.
Holy shit, midterms for everybody!"@WhiteHouse: BREAKING: Obama announces his #FreeCommunityCollege proposal → https://vine.co/v/Op6YEKWLOXP ”
@kalpenn - @GOP will block this because ignorant ppl are their base & they are only concerned with tax cuts for the wealthy.
@Barack_McBush @kalpenn @GOP cool you gonna pay for that free college out your hard earned money?
@bbbrianmartin Sure,I'll pay my fair share = educated population. Be nice if ppl like Mitt paid > than 14% tax of tens of Million$ in income
@Barack_McBush I don't want to pay another 50% out my already taxed to death paycheck for some yahoo to get free college.
@bbbrianmartin *Nobody is taxed to death in the U.S
