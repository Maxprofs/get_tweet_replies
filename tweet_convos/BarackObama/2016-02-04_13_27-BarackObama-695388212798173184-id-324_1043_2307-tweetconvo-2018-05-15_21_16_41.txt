@WhiteHouse @BarackObama HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR OBAMA CARE
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR OBAMA CARE
@WhiteHouse #biggovernmentpreventsfreedom
@WhiteHouse you don't have a choice not to sign up! Perhaps should say 'forced to sign up' as that would be more accurate
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Glad to see America finally catching up with the rest of the world.  We shouldn't profit off illness and death.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Now we must be able to cap the profit margins available to hospitals and meds, otherwise the taxpayer still loses!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes they did but 95% of them can't afford the deductible.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama wants to destroy America as we know it.  Hopefully its not too late
@WhiteHouse hahaha, because if they don't they get fined... How is that beneficial? How about going after the insurance companies.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I know people are wrong about you, Sir I know about the Council On Foreign Relations, Sir. All presidents since JFK
@WhiteHouse Not much of an accomplishment when people are forced to sign up or pay a price. I'm not against free health care.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @BarackObama @YouTube Stop helping pyd and pkk they working with Russia the kill syrian people.

@WhiteHouse @RussJohnsonIII
@WhiteHouse I am one of the Americans who are now covered thanks to the #ACA #Obamacare Thanks @POTUS @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse and what about the millions of americans who lost the health plans they had an the millions who now have to pay higher premiums?
@WhiteHouse and yet more than ever without care. price gouging. 2000%on meds that companies have monopolies on. 13 mil, joke by comparison
@WhiteHouse and thanks for the premium increases too
@WhiteHouse  and how much did that cost? Oh right, that doesn't matter
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You have a long way to go my daughter is a full  college student PT Server 22 no insurance
@WhiteHouse #healthcare #Obama's historical achievement since he was elected to office, but rejected by #republicans based on greed.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  What happened to Vision and Dental Care?
@WhiteHouse What a joke.  That's down from the 50,000,000 estimated.
@WhiteHouse and 15 million still can't afford it
@WhiteHouse Thanks to ACA I lost my coverage once, and my plan twice. Stellar law.
@bloginistawrite @WhiteHouse 钓鱼岛及其附属岛屿自古以来就是中国的固有领土,中国对此拥有充分的历史和法律依据
@shampoodan @WhiteHouse that's a popular argument, the rate of those uninsured has undeniably fallen though.
@shampoodan @WhiteHouse still waiting on that data
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama CHEAP AT TWICE THE COST, OH YEAH IT IS! TWICE THE PRICE
@WhiteHouse Am I right in thinking this approximately 4% of the population? Makes me wonder about the rest.
@WhiteHouse what happened to 30 million??
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That is wonderful
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obamacare is just that, Obama rob Peter to save his Muslim buds.
@WhiteHouse taxman cometh
@WhiteHouse it's amazing what can be done when you make something mandatory
@WhiteHouse Most are signing up because they are being FORCED to have it, or pay fines and possibly go to jail..
@WhiteHouse are the prices cheaper now or has it gotten higher.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama But the cost of health care has gone up not down and employer coverage has become worse.
@WhiteHouse amazing what you can do when you legally mandate signing up...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama at what cost?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Plz sign up for Bill Mahr!!
@WhiteHouse But how many have lost coverage or now pay more than they did and with higher deductibles?   Useless...
@WhiteHouse  without the #ACA and my diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, I would be in constant pain. Thank you Pres. Obama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama we live in Louisiana and have been denied health care by Bobby for years. 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama no, thanks to the other 100M that are paying for it through increased healthcare costs
@WhiteHouse do you think that's because if they don't sign up and buy it you guys are going to fine them anyways?
@WhiteHouse #AmericasPandemicIgnorance We're so done for. Great OL Government, NOT!
@WhiteHouse STOP touting the wrong numbers and information. Besides that, 13 Million is nothing.
@WhiteHouse 30 million still don't have healthcare and premiums and deductibles have tripled!! Fail!!!
@WhiteHouse Mr Obama you're my favourite 
@WhiteHouse amazing what the government can get done when they use the treat of fines!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama BECAUSE YOU FORCED THEM!!!! ACA is garbage.
@WhiteHouse yeah because they are FORCED TO not because it is affordable
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Oh my. LMXO. You're "good".
@WhiteHouse Thank you for helping folks see the doctor and receive medicine#Thanks
@WhiteHouse how many have paid a premium?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama We pray that the wisdom of God the Holy Ghost will bless and protect all who work in health care in all America.
@WhiteHouse how many refuse

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama good news
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Under threat of penalty. It's crap. You should put your family on it if it's so great. #Hypocrite #ImpeachObama
@WhiteHouse Stupid is what stupid does. This is unaffordable crony sick care. That fascist US and it's sheeple patriots.
@WhiteHouse good for them... But I can't afford it as a full time student working part time
@WhiteHouse @RRuby44 wow. Amazing how much you can accomplish when you force people to fall in line or pay a fine.
@NJZychowicz I'm cool forcing people to have health insurance so my tax dollars don't have to pay for their even more expensive ER trips!
@WhiteHouse  Wonderful.  Now how do they pay the deductible?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama There's just 1 word that has no place in the sentence...AFFORDABLE.
@WhiteHouse thanks? or because they'll receive a tax penalty if they don't?
@WhiteHouse and they say it should last....
@WhiteHouse family member going to have to cough up ~$700 monthly... That's affordable? Politicians maybe POTUS definitely! Dems help?sure!
@WhiteHouse shocked every day. I have never seen in my life and in my home town so many homeless people. U R gone soon!

@WhiteHouse well the numbers are a little misleading since most had to get it to avoid a penalty.  Not really my idea of freedom of choice.
@WhiteHouse : what will happen to the 13 million people who have enrolled in Affordable Care Act if Republicans can generate repeal support?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that's a lie!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama https://youtu.be/rZyqsDGCt3k 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Is that enough to sustain the program?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama WHAT IF IT WAS YOUR WIFE AND DAUGHTERS?  OR DONT YOU CARE ABOUT THEM EITHER?
@WhiteHouse the tax man cometh!
@WhiteHouse - what do you expect? People that don't signup get fined. Not much of a choice.
@WhiteHouse MY niece worked her entire career as a nurse and had to give up ACA,she could not afford it.!!!!
@WhiteHouse once again, thank you Potus
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Bless the nations O God we pray and bring them to unity and stability and peace. Our Father. ...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama propaganda
@WhiteHouse This makes it sound like we had a Choice. Take away the penalty threat and let's see what happens .
@WhiteHouse :American people are raising the question to cure disease but Oromo people are asking a right to live!! http://www.thedailyvox.co.za/bloody-repression-in-ethiopia-and-why-feesmustfall-should-take-notice/ …
@WhiteHouse Love the wording. I notice you didn't state that 13 million NEW (previously uninsured) Americans signed up. #CommonCoreMath
@WhiteHouse How many of the 13 million were forced to sign up because you deemed their current health insurance "inadequate"?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 13 million is a huge failure

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama can't wait for them to repeal every word your pen struck.
@WhiteHouse awesome news !
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Commercials of individuals being able to get low monthly premiums are 'all lies.'
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hogwash! ACA is in no way affordable. The http://healthcare.gov  website is a total rip off.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Dinero para pos conflicto es dinero para la corrupción y la impunidad de las FARC que horror
@WhiteHouse well Mohamed likes it.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama privet ,serega petelin gdet !
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama A great accomplishment. Cover California is up notably, amongst young individuals, 37%. Thanks to President Obama!!
@WhiteHouse I'm a nurse still many have no insurance. Can't afford it
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama those who can't afford healthcare are fined for it. #Unconstitutional
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That's one of the reasons American people cannot stand you anymore. Republicans will prevail this time.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Millions of Christians have been murdered by radical islamic terrorists. Still, you just go to a mosque.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Question: why, instead of going to a mosque, you don't go to a Christian church?
@WhiteHouse only 13 million that's like the total pop of New York  WHAT!  are you nuts! That's a joke
@WhiteHouse what choice do they have???
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama This goes to show how much affordable health care is needed in this country.
@WhiteHouse The only up side I can find is that I got a new insurance card.
@WhiteHouse Since the insurance doesn't help for pay office visits, tests, and help with meds, what good is it?
@WhiteHouse Well thanks to these mandates my premiums have gone up! Thanks a pant load!
@WhiteHouse Good Medical Insurance, When &Patient &Doctor Are Happy With Service With Money, 14 millions insured, &When Doctors Are Paid...
@WhiteHouse And when Doctors Are Paid Doctor is happy. And this is Good, When Doctor's Happy. Cause we all are there Patients.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Nearly 90 million Egyptians are sick. 
@WhiteHouse Just because people signed up does not mean the program is working.
@WhiteHouse @PMOIndia Mr Modi plz do for us also
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Última hora:Gracias a la ley de atención asequible casi 13millones d americanos firmaron para la cobertura de salud
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how many lost insurance because it's now unaffordable? Or do you just not care about us?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What about the millions who lost their coverage and whose costs have skyrocketed?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and 2500 dlls deductible should i thank Obama for that too??? Plus doubled up national debt well done mr BHO
@WhiteHouse yay!! Glad the 97% have to pay double what we paid 3 years ago so the 3% can get coverage!! Yay, celebrate!!! #sarcasm.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama before OBAMACARE i was paying 146 dlls weekly and a deductible of 1000 dlls after  OBAMACARE im paying $392 weekly
@WhiteHouse     Thats really a small # and with deductables so high, its really crap anyway. Just another government hold on citizens.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama MT resident. Insurance I can barely afford and coverage I can't afford to use. $5000 deductible. Can't afford that
@WhiteHouse   otherwise they get a fine
@WhiteHouse - in real numbers, how many were forced into PPACA after being cancelled?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama とってもいいね！
@WhiteHouse Forced into submission would be the most accurate verbiage here, would it not be? My costs have skyrocketed due to this! Thx?
@WhiteHouse LOL , that is because you forced them. It isn't affordable and cannot be used. Typical for a gov't program.
@WhiteHouse @stefsstuff 
without taxpayers having to pay for a superbowl stadium
@WhiteHouse @stefsstuff And this is one great reason to support Hillary, she fought for Health Care as First Lady and will keep ACA strong.
@WhiteHouse @DonQuixote1950 According to the @GOP this would put millions of people out of work & destroy our economy what happened?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  its not that affordable. Universal Heathcare is all I am saying. Get the insurance companies out of here. Period
@WhiteHouse Out of 350 Million plus citizens that is really impressive LMAO
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  because it was forced upon us through taxation #unfoundedmandate towards the people. Keep it up #FreedomDoomed
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama tres bien, bonne journée.
@WhiteHouse and over 20 million have lost it thanks to obamacare
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama didn't you post something a week ago saying it was 14 million Americans? Yeah. Cuz I responded to it. Lying ass.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I didn't/don't want to. I shouldn't have to. #freedom

@WhiteHouse Obamacare is garbage.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama meanwhile hard working people can no longer afford to see dr because of outrageous premiums and large deductible
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama you mean were forced to, or pay the tax/penalty. Don't cry when your coverage is shitty.
@WhiteHouse

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama thank God for Obama despite the right wing and lobbists.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  That 4.3% of the population. #Obamacare = huge failure
@WhiteHouse did the 13 million have a choice, either sign up or be fined? Some choice.
@WhiteHouse how many still living in poverty?  Enough with the victory laps.  Do your job
@WhiteHouse ....Obama speech..do u really think we are stupid Americans?  Ugh!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama for making me work 70 hrs to pay for this crap what you call health care

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Well done
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama interesting use of super bowl reference to plug forced insurance amidst concussion & brain damage issues w/ nfl
