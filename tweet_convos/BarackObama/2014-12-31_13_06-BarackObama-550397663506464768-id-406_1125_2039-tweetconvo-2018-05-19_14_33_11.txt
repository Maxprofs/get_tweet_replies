@BarackObama instead of fighting back why not work together as our government should be for the people instead of fighting like children.

@BarackObama Time will tell
@BarackObama - Yeah... Now you will really have to work for your salary - You can't stand that can you ?
@BarackObama u r d man
@BarackObama Maybe we should define progress first
@BarackObama You resigning would be the greatest contribution to real progress! Amnesty for illegals is not progress!
@BarackObama let's fight for your arrest ...
@BarackObama Very good Progress God Blues you
@BarackObama @txstarkeeper And Dem candidates need to run WITH the President...not FROM him. Sick of that crap!

@BarackObama 
I don't even care about partisans anymore. That's a secondary issue. I'd much rather SEPARATE WEALTH from STATE/POLITICS.
@BarackObama CLASS WARFARE BASED ON GENDER AND RACE AND ETHNICITY AND INCOME...WELL SAID MR. PRESIDENT
@BarackObama good job! Keep moving
@BarackObama #FreeTheWeed
@BarackObama
@BarackObama meanwhile the rest of America will wait for true leadership not a dem or rep super majority.
@BarackObama  what do you mean you fat black fucken pig I will behead you
@BarackObama These turds will be devastating for the USA. Just shows how bad the education of our population is.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama  Progress would be your arrest and trial for election fraud and usurpation,treason and being a spy.
@BarackObama  Technically, Boehner is POTUS and you ain't.
@RobertCLaity You are one of only about 20 people that believe this. It isn't true and never will be.
@NedSparks  It is true. Obama and Biden obtained their respective offices by fraudulent means (Usurpation).
@RobertCLaity The actual people with the final word disagree with you.
@NedSparks  I would expect they do. They are corrupt members of the Obama RICO cabal.
@BarackObama good thoughts
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Thank you for fighting climate change. We all need you, and thank you for caring about the planet as much as anything else. 
@BarackObama  mi presidente, feliz año nuevo!!!

@BarackObama Honestly man,  I don't know how you going to deal with Boehner and Mitch(ignorant clowns)the next two years.  Sorry dude.
@BarackObama @mikedodson1956 Let's fight for progress towards smaller government
@BarackObama Sounds like you're planning on being the "President of NO"!
.@BarackObama you're the president of The United States, how about we not subtweet lawmakers?

@BarackObama h n y 2015 & waiting how TO develop  INDIA
@BarackObama Your tag line needs more worj. All I saw was the GOP wanting to fight.
@BarackObama this is petty and elementary. You need to be better than this, for everyone.
@BarackObama Wow that's really infantile Obama, even for you.
@BarackObama Are going tobet my county de mercusuar dunia
@BarackObama Fight back? Against what? Progress? The best economy that we have seen in 6yrs? Lowest gas prices in 6yrs?

@BarackObama /Happy new year
@BarackObama Posts like this reveal what we already know.  You never have intended to reach across the isle.
@BarackObama Who are those guys? Don't recognize them....theyr not doing anything, but sitting there...smh
Someone's been following @TonyLeonSA... “@BarackObama: Let's fight for progress next year: http://ofa.bo/t2By  ”
“@BarackObama: Let's fight for progress next year: http://ofa.bo/t2By  ” great attitude
@BarackObama Thought you had your veto pen sitting on go?  Doesn't sound like you're willing to work with anyone.  Make up your damn mind!
@BarackObama Honey, are preparing to eat New Year's Dinner, and then are you preparing your theme café to grand openning
@BarackObama I would rather have these guys than Reid and Pelosi!
@BarackObama I'm gonna fight to get you IMPEACHED for lying to us and Congress. Or why don't you just disappear?
@BarackObama McConnell will at least allow bills to reach the senate floor. Can't say that about Reid. #politics
@BarackObama But U are the KING so U don't need congress anyway from what U do & say. So just go screw yourself & up to Sharpton
@BarackObama omg

@BarackObama Hopefully the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future visited these two Scrooges over the holidays
@BarackObama we will fight for progress ,thank you presdant Obama
@BarackObama big supporter of yours, but this is distasteful
“@BarackObama: Let's fight for progress next year: http://ofa.bo/t2By  ” @Chip4Pres that's a scary couple
@DippinDoddsss @BarackObama I saw this tweet and cringed a bit. Nothing's going to be accomplished in the next 2 years
@Chip4Pres @BarackObama the next two years will be arguing and more arguing and then some more arguing, with absolutely no progress
@BarackObama I'm exasperated already! Lawd! Give me strength!
@BarackObama Wow. Can we get a veneer of willingness to compromise? If this is what working together looks like no wonder nothing gets done.
@BarackObama progress with fight next year
@BarackObama sorrye
@BarackObama Bully
@BarackObama
@BarackObama happy new year
@BarackObama the lack of leadership displayed here is appalling. Telling us that one branch of government is "fighting"another is damaging.
@BarackObama May I wish you and your family a happy and prosperous new year Mr President.
@BarackObama good to see them
@BarackObama not your best tweet.  better to take the #highroad
“@BarackObama: Let's fight for progress next year: http://ofa.bo/t2By  ” way to support bi-partisanship el jefe?
@BarackObama Disappointed in this post. I'm a huge fan, but this is no way to start off when you just lost control of congress!
@BarackObama why do you make enemies of those you want to work with? This raises money, not discourse.
@BarackObama lol you're petty and don't understand that other ideas might be worth a shot.   Be thankful you got 8 years to try yours.
@JesseRinggold @BarackObama #TeamRepublican
@BarackObama instead of "fighting back" how about trying to work together?
@BarackObama Happy new year!
@BarackObama too bigger idiots would be hard to find    it is like going back 100 years   protecting bigots  ruining the envirnment
@BarackObama Proactive only works if those involved are in agreement. The rest is concession.
@BarackObama Indeed let us all fight for progress this year.
@BarackObama your type of progress sent us back to the 60's you racist!
@BarackObama I love you
