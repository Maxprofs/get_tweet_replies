@BarackObama In this question, i am agree with President Obama.
@BarackObama now that the president supports Education for girls, republicans will dissaprove of women's empowerment, watch you'll see.
@BarackObama why don't we encourage our girls in the U.S. And provide more funds to education. The U.S. gives money away,look after our own.
@BarackObama what #LetGirlsLearn is truly striving for is cultural revolution, needing more than friendly reminders and threats of sanctions
