@BarackObama I very much doubt 97% is the truth.
@_HighPlaces proof?
@SpillaneMj I am doubting his figure not proving he's wrong. The onus would be on him to prove it as he's made the claim.
@_HighPlaces you do realise he is quoting a refereed paper?
@SpillaneMj And I would know that how?
@_HighPlaces do you often question people on topics you are happy to claim ignorance of?
Read the abstract.

@SpillaneMj @_HighPlaces
@jeffersonianguy you should read the paper.
This is false. Read the abstract that footnote 1 on NASAs page references. Not even close to 97%. It's~30%.
@BarackObama @BearWithABeard_
@jeffersonianguy @BarackObama A reference in an article that uses a 2011 consensus. It's been half a decade since then. And < 1% reject it.
Source your less than 1% reject man made climate change, please.

@BearWithABeard_ @BarackObama
@jeffersonianguy "...32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain..."

From the J. Cook abstract.
How does 32.6% endorse become 97% endorse? Genuinely curious.

@BearWithABeard_
@jeffersonianguy You proved your point. But now you're dodging my original statement that less than 1% reject it.
Less than 1% of the 33% in the study. Did they arbitrarily assign a position to the other 67%?

@BearWithABeard_
@jeffersonianguy The other 67% are more than likely awaiting more data to be shown before taking a stance. And they're getting it.
@BarackObama same scientists that just found a new planet?http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/20/us/possible-ninth-planet/ …
Science is evolving. Nothing is definitive until proven.
@tombaugh what do you think scientific proof is?
@SpillaneMj Controlling variables so that you can isolate the cause. They cant predict the WX tomorrow. I guarantee there's climate change.
@tombaugh not sure what point you are making.
@BarackObama That's a lie. Btw, just how much snow is "enough"?
@Mark_Brooks Are you?
@Mark_Brooks Ur prob is you don't think 4 urself. I'm not "listening 2oil shills". Any1 with 1/2abrain knows there is no global temperature.
@BarackObama @TelfordCC So true and in the future it is going to effect us in the long run:(
@TelfordCC thank you for writing me back really appreciated it, thanks for the feed back, I never thought someone like u would write back!!
@TelfordCC Hey can you give me a shout out, I would gladly appreciated it :) Thanks again!!!
@TelfordCC @mrhighlights1 but sometimes you have to SO Andy. Unless you're in it for the follows and RT's only?
@BarackObama yes they will be very lonely, and ignorant as well! All the pollution that man has made is a big factor!
@BarackObama OMG CLIMATE CHANGE, r u kidding, you mean wealth redistribution don't you? this is what this is about! tell the truth.
@BarackObama Mr. President: Why don´t you declassify all Nikola Tesla life work seized by Gvmt? New free energy will make a better world!
@BarackObama 97% Of Scientists and 200 World Leaders Along With The Pope & President Obama Agree About Ending Climate Change From CARBON!
@BarackObama are we still debating that? Wow! It's Real.
@TheLeeWilliams education sux!!Type "what's the hottest the earth has ever been" http://climate.gov 
We have NO effect on global climate
@BarackObama we've had 5 ICE AGES!!1/2 of US was glacial.Most of GA where I live used to be under H2O.Stop believing the climate change lies
@BarackObama smaller but yet more powerful could be the radiation
@RobertBCrim @BarackObama personal value judgments?
@RobertBCrim @BarackObama I understand. I'd say, I do not want GCC, but not for more than to not lose the ecological balance we have
@BarackObama something I don't like also if move the time forward, it's not necessary
The other 3% are the real specialist  ?  :-)
@BarackObama i say bullshit
@BarackObama cooo

@BarackObama  You say too right, as all are man-made climate change
@BarackObama ...they are so right.
@BarackObama that's a lie. More propagandized statement from you that is chronically false.
Way past the hypothesis phase. It's a thoroughly vetted scientific theory which requires immediate action. @RobertBCrim @barackobama
@baughman_brad @BarackObama global warming and the ice age REAL dangers!! we must take them seriously!! Obama needs to take action
@baughman_brad @BarackObama and yes you can have both... Scientists have proven this... get with the program...
@baughman_brad @BarackObama I can't... thats for the scientists to know and only for them to know. And keep it confidential for our safety.
@BarackObama bullshit. ..
@BarackObama Why not support genzal hufter personally and talk to him and make fighting terrorism without interfering in Affairs of Libya
@BarackObama amigo in our town it's been 4 years with no plastic bags of any kind, 6 years of beach clean ups and more activism, aloha.

@BarackObama يمعود استاذ ممكن تراعي ظروفنه الاجئين
@BarackObama There is proof that earth goes through climate change on its own. Kinda like a period for women.
@BarackObama I doubt you'll have time for me since I'm just a nobody, but are your resources biased? On the whole climate change.
@BarackObama you song like  boring already go home retired
@BarackObama you don't think that we have Mr. President and I'll problem to be worry about the Global warming
@BarackObama I agree with you about climate change, as I recently moved to #Chicago from #Arizona and have actually handled this winter!
@BarackObama 100% of Monetary Scientists agree: NAT-DEBT caused by too many folks demanding "Safety from uncertainty" with no cost to them!

@BarackObama This is the current tilt degree. We still have 14 degrees to go. That's what's causing #climatechange
@BarackObama Only idiots think that climate change is 100% man made.
