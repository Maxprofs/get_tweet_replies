@BarackObama that's why we elected you.
@BarackObama Very true. Solar is way more affordable and efficient than it used to be. Which was the only counter argument for solar.
@BarackObama @Reuters Been waiting 4 this. AC very old. Want to replace w/ solar but too expensive. Great idea! Whom to contract in my area?
@BarackObama other countrys also need to give boost to solar energy and house tax can adjusted as an incentive
@BarackObama ThankuMr.BarackObamaweneedEnergybillscuthalf√√√√√\\∆∆××--%#Energy
@BarackObama it's about time we do that.
.@BarackObama $1 billion in loan guarantees? Yeah, this sounds like another payoff for cronies, same as Solyndra and First Solar.
@BarackObama @Reuters cool!
@BarackObama ;)
@BarackObama @Reuters Cheaper? No because someone else still has to pick up the tab, just not them
@BarackObama Why is it ok for you to take money from my family to give to your green energy campaign contributors?

@BarackObama I thought this was Pres. Obama. The problem with eliminating coal made energy is that we still need it to run major plants.
@BarackObama /Why no one ask Obama if he is going to pay all the cost for the change this home owners have to pay to make there houses solar
@BarackObama @Reuters Go on with incentives to switch to green energy:this could be a best practice transferable to all developed countries.
@BarackObama That's great!
