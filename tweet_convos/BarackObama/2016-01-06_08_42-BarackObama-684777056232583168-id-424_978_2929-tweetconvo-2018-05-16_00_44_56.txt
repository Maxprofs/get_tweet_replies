@BarackObama @OFA
@BarackObama you are going about it the wrong way. Guns don't kill people, criminals do, and most don't have permits
@BarackObama guns should be allowed only for army. Neither a robber could get a gun nor a common man.
@BarackObama @OFA Jim
@BarackObama Well, Congress SHOULD. But they are bought and paid for by the NRA. They seem to forget who they work for. #StopGunViolence

@BarackObama I disagree. Stop PPH. Killing babies is a sin.
@BarackObama @OFA the #2Amendment #newamendment #therighttoarmbears. Change it to the right to arm bears  #StopGunViolence  from Ireland

@BarackObama You have had years to control gun violence in the USA & have done nothing. You are to blame for current situation. @PaulNiland
@BarackObama it's easier to ignore gun violence if I bury my head in the sand. And it also makes it harder for someone to shoot my head off.
