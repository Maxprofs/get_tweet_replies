@BarackObama @latimes Wait...did I just hear Obama actually use the word constitution?
@BarackObama @latimes Tell it to your VP, #JoeBiden & also #ChuckSchumer...
They disagree w/ you.."No Election Year SCOTUS appointments."
@BarackObama @latimes the Presidents has the rights to appoint Political Parties, like President Lincoln did with the Negro Republican Party
@BarackObama @latimes Repub's used to leaving things undone. Won't pass 
Bills on budget then blame President for debt. ARE VOTERS BLIND?
@BarackObama @latimes 
no....the Senate does NOT have a constitutional duty to expedite judicial nominees.
properly vetted yes.
@BarackObama @latimes ...Dear Mr. President 
Barack Obama I would like to see you on that seat. You would be perfect. – at Kahwa
@BarackObama @latimes , not in an election year. Just ask your VP
@BarackObama @latimes  What's good for the Goose is good for the Gander...Forget about it...Not gonna happen.. #SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
@BarackObama @latimes since when do you care about the constitution???
@BarackObama @latimes funny joe Biden didn't feel that way he claims an appointee shouldn't be made in election yr any thoughts?
@BarackObama @areyou0 @latimes Yea, but that was the way the founders designed it 2B, Not the way it has been degenerated in2b'ing today.
@BarackObama @latimes Give me a break. Since WHEN does obama follow the Constitution?
@BarackObama @latimes I hope the White House staff are preparing for #Trump I've heard he loves steak! ;) just say'in
@laurastapleton4 @BarackObama @latimes Will Americans elect & trust a Republican this time around? http://youtu.be/40p0yjTIIGY?a 
@BarackObama @latimes Gee, Barack, I don't think the Constitution says that at all.
@BobGriggs @BarackObama @latimes Will Americans elect & trust a Republican this time around? http://youtu.be/40p0yjTIIGY?a

@BarackObama @latimes #Impeach them!
@BarackObama @latimes you're party done the same thing
@BarackObama @latimes   Says who?
@BarackObama They had a constitutional duty to govern as well, but decided at their treasonous 1/20/09 meeting not to.
@BarackObama IF the name is "leaked" & it is someone who is a Constitutionalist, a fair judge, the Rep. would reconsider. @latimes
@BarackObama @latimes  I plan on making it my civic duty to inform my fellow North Carolinans that @SenatorBurr is refusing to do his job
@BarackObama @latimes

@BarackObama @latimes ...doesn't this mean anyone seeing this as your "lame-duck" year would themselves take their last year in office as...
@BarackObama @latimes ...a lame-duck year? Pretty much telling the American people that they would only b electing them to 3 solid years and
@BarackObama @latimes ...a lame-duck year; which I'm guessing means that they wouldn't aim for getting anything accomplished for the people?
@BarackObama @latimes ...its an insane thought to logic. You must have seriously dealt w/ some insanity :-/
@BarackObama @latimes ...of course 4 since assumptions cannot be made...but still offering 7 solid years and a lame-duck year is insane too.
@BarackObama @latimes ... I got a feeling you are going to do your job to the fullest until the day you hand it off ... @BarackObama might b
@BarackObama @latimes ... leaving office but @POTUS is a forever thing; a top job no slacking reality? Some thoughts to politics are insane.

@BarackObama @latimes Does government have any responsibilities when it comes to the Controlled Substances Act? Don't be a hypocrite.
@BarackObama @latimes Fire for fire
@BarackObama @latimes the people should vote too. Obama will be gone not soon enough. Why should he have any say in this?

@BarackObama @latimes I guess Barry hasn't consulted with @SenSchumer
@BarackObama they have to honor the process no matter the outcome.
@BarackObama @latimes The Senate has the responsibility to review and confirm or deny any Supreme Court Nominee in due time. No clock.
Adjunct lecturer is wrong. RT @BarackObama: “The Senate also has a constitutional duty: to consider presidential nominees expeditiously.”
@BarackObama @latimes 
Obama says: http://abcn.ws/1mALb65 
Shumer: http://bit.ly/1QgffeL 
@BarackObama @latimes They ignore their duties completely as #McConnelsFools have done from the beginning of your presidency.
@BarackObama @latimes perhaps the responsibility what to include the word objectively. They should judge the candidate by merit not politics
