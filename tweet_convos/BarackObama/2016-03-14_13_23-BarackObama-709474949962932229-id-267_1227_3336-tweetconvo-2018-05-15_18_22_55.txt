@BarackObama Also, it doesn't matter what polls say, the constitution says hearings should be held!
@PauljGarth @BarackObama Point of order: Article
 2 Section 2 says nothing about "hearings".  Only "advice and consent". Sen advises "no".
@TConservativeA @PauljGarth @BarackObama Go look up what "consent" means
@jerkass27 @PauljGarth @BarackObama The burden is on the President to convince the Senate. Not the other way around.
@TConservativeA @jerkass27 @BarackObama and I'm sure they can do that without hearings... Oh, wait.
@PauljGarth @jerkass27 @BarackObama Decisions, rulings, & written opinions are public rec. Can tell if nom is worth a hearing at all by past
@TConservativeA I like how you're rewriting 200 years of history.
@PauljGarth No mention of hearings in Const. & no need to rewrite, Madison kept great notes http://tws.io/1PWZJZG 
@BarackObama @DamaVenenosa @byamberphillips But the sitting VP doesn't.
@BarackObama wish you could run again.  This election is a mess!!
@deblynbode @barackobama Please sign White House petition and forward. Thanks. https://wh.gov/iGXui 
@BarackObama @washingtonpost you sir and @HillaryClinton belong to prison #Benghazi @CNN @FoxNews @seanhannity
@AlandichoMy @BarackObama @washingtonpost @HillaryClinton @CNN @FoxNews @seanhannity Belong TO prison? Why can't  haters use proper English?
@Cressett  @HillaryClinton @CNN @FoxNews  you probably are one of the beneficiaries from the taxes I pay. By the way, I speak 5 languages.
@AlandichoMy @HillaryClinton @CNN @FoxNews We all benefit from the taxes we pay. Perhaps you would like Swift's "modest proposal."
@BarackObama @byamberphillips تبي تسوي مثل جورج بوش في نهايتهم
@BarackObama @washingtonpost yes, this us the worst senate ever. The people voted for him let him do his job.
@BarackObama @byamberphillips and nearly a 1/3 of Americans think your Muslim. Source CNN. So what's your point?
@BarackObama @washingtonpost  when has it ever been about what the people want with republicans?
@BarackObama @hirschmk Nope.
@BarackObama So Not True! Get your Facts Straight!
@BarackObama I agree; they should hold hearings. And they should vote "down" every nominee you offer up.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost @ThomTillis @SenatorBurr

@BarackObama @washingtonpost majority of Americans are also against amnesty for illegals, that doesn't seem to bother you though.

@BarackObama @washingtonpost don't let trump to be your Erdoğan named as (president of Turkish Republic)hahaha what a Republic after Atatürk
@BarackObama @washingtonpost 爷思！！！

@BarackObama @byamberphillips the 1 of the 3 are not that bright...
@BarackObama We don't believe Trump or Hillary! We believe Buddha and Bernie! 
#Trump2016 #Hillary2016 #Bernie2016 #mindfulness #meditation
@BarackObama HA HA HA , TOO BAD American citizens can't hold hearings !!
@BarackObama Nominate someone and watch how the People get the person confirmed!
@BarackObama The Senate claims to represent the people, let THE PEOPLE speak! Show the poll, advertise the poll, bring it to the PEOPLE.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost And anyone who reads the Constitution knows that there is no such requirement.
@BarackObama by a margin of 2-1, there are more people not working so they can take @washingtonpost polls on #SCOTUS. Get a job!
@BarackObama @byamberphillips Yet they will continue to ignore the Constitution and the will of the people.
@BarackObama The majority is not wrong on this matter. President Obama should call the bluff of the Republicans.
@BarackObama @Dijokatmom It doesn't matter what people want.  The Constitution says Congress needs to do their f*ing job #DoYourJob
@BarackObama Americanos creen que el Senado debe celebrar audiencias sobre un candidato de #SCOTUS: http://ofa.bo/d5mM 
Of course we believe it @BarackObama ! YOU are the president and YOU have the RIGHT to nominate! And I'd flood them with wonderful nominees!
@BarackObama @byamberphillips #GOP #senate GOP senate, abating justice, protecting criminals.
@BarackObama @byamberphillips They should not only hold hearings, they should approve.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost @POTUS @WhiteHouse 
 yes Senate should
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Its possible in a fantasy world where democracy is a true reflection of voters wishes by public representatives
@BarackObama @byamberphillips Elections have consequences.  No vote .... From the Pres himself.
@BarackObama all the sudden you want to follow the constitution.  #gtfo
@BarackObama it's almost like Americans understand it's their f$!?ing job no matter how much they dislike it #ElectionsHaveConsequences

@BarackObama @byamberphillips Gotta laugh at these lefties who have suddenly found religion and want to follow the Constitution. #hypocrisy
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama @byamberphillips America voted in Republicans to run the Senate. That trumps your poll.
@BarackObama So since the Senate is SUPPOSED to represent the American people - 2/3 of the Senate support it also!!  Right?!?  
@BarackObama    By a 100,000,000 to 1 margin, citizens think u have ruined this country, which was your objective from day one.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost I love you
@BarackObama Yet, GOP Obstructionist; by their own admission, launching biggest negative campaign AGAINST the results of the Poll above.
@BarackObama how are they still employed after this blatant disrespect for not only you but us, the American people?
@BarackObama @byamberphillips why do you believe that the sentiments of the country have evolved since the time Dems held the opposite view?
@BarackObama @byamberphillips lol....you still here?
@BarackObama @washingtonpost No we don't. By the way...I smell B.O.
@BarackObama always keep a open mind.Instead of a candidate that will chisel away at Constitution get one who will protect it!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost focos on terrorismo sivernetico now
@BarackObama Do you have a nominee picked out yet? If not stop running the chops, and pick one. Then will see what happens!
@BarackObama @byamberphillips to bad so sad
@BarackObama @byamberphillips #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @byamberphillips of course they should! But the Senate leaders have difficulty doing their job!
@BarackObama @byamberphillips LIES! I Don't know a soul who believes this!! 2:1 my foot!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost nesesitamos  respaldo de UD para muestro proceso de estén di miento y si Jehová con nosotros batallas ganadas
@BarackObama cherrypicking polls i see
@BarackObama who did you poll? Your OFA minions? The Senate is taking your example and how you treated Bush.
@BarackObama You have to nominate someone first, buttfucker.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost the polls ive seen say the opposite. U idiots wouldn't be lying again would you. We will elect someone someday
@BarackObama Thanks for stopping the foreign mining company digging up scared Apache Land. I'm not a " native-american", from Australia
@BarackObama and by the climate of obstructionism the odds are also 2 to 1 that the haterz will be elected out of Congress 
@BarackObama @byamberphillips Barack and Biden both suggested no votes on SCOTUS at past presidential elections #hypocrite
@BarackObama By a margin of bout a 10,000,000:1,Americans believe u should've had the Cojones to introduce legislation for lower drug prices
@BarackObama who cares!! UR #muslim shitbags: http://www.blazingcatfur.ca/2016/03/14/like-a-scene-from-planet-of-the-apes/ … & b'hood filth: http://www.brotherhoodunmasked.net/  @WhiteHouse #stopislam #cair
@BarackObama You didn't care about public opinion when passing Obamacare.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost 138 #murdered thanks to #POTUS #nancypelosi #harryreid #DNC release of #illegals
@BarackObama I agree - it is disgraceful that some people don't think you should choose the Supreme Court nominee!!
@BarackObama  let me guess.  You dont count votes from people who "left the workforce".  Nobody believes you.
@BarackObama Well Obama's  figures over the last 7 years R ALWAYS KIND OF WRONG! So ur figures can't be used. MAYBE 2 FOR U-TO-2000, NO'S.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost does anyone actually think these republicans care about what the people want?
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Nominate who is qualified for the position. As my President you have made some great decision!!!!!!! GO
@BarackObama @washingtonpost please endorse BERNIE

@BarackObama @washingtonpost the problem is that Congress doesn't acknowledge the will of the people.
@BarackObama Lets see the stats.  No one asked me so your stats are fake just like the rest of your stats and speech
@BarackObama   Yes!
@BarackObama @byamberphillips if you say it, I KNOW it is a lie!
@BarackObama @byamberphillips Yah, Mr. President, but your own VP doesn't think it's appropriate.
@BarackObama @byamberphillips of course they should. It's their job to do so.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost all you Nobama supporters are traitors!
@BarackObama I will miss you come November.
@BarackObama please Mr President do not give in to the idiot republicans anymore. You only have 8 months to exercise your power.
@BarackObama I believe Donald Trump can make this country what it once was. A large Arctic region covered with ice. #SteveMartin
@BarackObama Wow!...you believed the opposite just a few years back!
And you have to ask all the citizens, not just Liberals.
@BarackObama @POTUS, @SenatorReid silenced us by taking away our voices once. You won't do it now. #NuclearOption #ElectionsHaveConsequences
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Vote out the pure partisan obstructionists from the Senate and House!  There must be compromise
@BarackObama @VP Biden: 'Action On Supreme Court Nomination Must Be Put Off Until After Election Campaign Is Over'
@BarackObama @chuckschumer Called For Blocking All Bush SCOTUS Nominations, and did.
@BarackObama @SenatorReid on Constitutional Duty. The Constitution hasn't changed since 2005. Same rules apply.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost did you put forward a nomination yet? What's the holdup?
@BarackObama @POTUS First President in US History to Have Voted to Filibuster a Supreme Court Nominee

@BarackObama What are those children afraid of? ?

@BarackObama @byamberphillips slackers must be fired. Fire Mitch McConnell

@BarackObama @byamberphillips Who's going to accept a nomination just to be voted down in this charade and forever be damaged goods #Stupid
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Is there a way to make Donald Trump SCOTUS so he won't become POTUS
@BarackObama OH thank you so much.！
@BarackObama Ball's in your court. Nominate.
