THE WOMEN ARE VERY GOOD, TRY ALWAYS TO THINK THAT ALL ARE A FLOWER, and that needs to be watered ALL DAY WITH MUCH LOVE.
I Agree Sir But we need to educate them specially in Pakistan and South Asia
one way, vote Trump #neverhillary
#being president of USA you can make a difference
Obama and allies have turned the clock back for women in parts of Sunni Islamist controlled areas, Libya, and so forth...
I will be most happy if coloured people will also be treated equally in U.S.A.
treating equally does not count unless the mindset changes. #fact
the worl will be amazing bro no worry..
yes , to vote for the first woman president
Thank you so much for allowing women to have the freedom of speech, not only in reality but online as well! #freedom
just can't help yourself, huh? Here's hoping America can dig herself out from the abyss after 8 years of your occupation..
How fortunate are we to have leaders like this?!?! VERY!!!
women is half sky
You suck
haven't come along way it's 2016 and leaders still feel the need to hide our galactic family from the people announce et alien
disclosure to the masses - their homes and galaxies matter as well
hi sir its a very best idea for your country.
Gender equality is a good idea which should be keenly observed.
How about we ratify the ERA? Seems like a good start to me.
treat Hillary equally. Anyone else would have been charged/held accountable.
I truly hope the next American President is a woman, it is about time for our gender to break the glass ceiling
really great.
YES
don't lecture us direct your comments to Muslims who oppress women.
so true
I love you
True talk. Anything that has to be do fo women to be treated equally, its no problen

You are correct! There is still more to do for women to be truly treated like Arabs treat them, keep up the good work Sir!!!
yes I agree with President Obama, it's time for women  to close the equality for women and elect Secretary Hillary
equality is a myth, men and women are not equal. One is not better than the other, but we are not equal.

They will not like it once they have it. Or it will not be true equality.

@BarackObama
I wish more men thought like you. You give us hope.
hi president i'll encourage to realize this ambition it's long run elboo thanks
If women loved their bodies, a lot of industries would go out of business. See why many don't want them to take control?

Obama is a liar and hypocrite. Women working in the White House are paid less than the men working there.Obama Worst POTUS EVER
like make them sign up for selective service?

@joannagoing1 What does it say about commitment to equality when @BarackObama strives to appease a faction that opposes women's equality?
That's true..There should b equality in terms of respect...  We should respect both the genders equally!
Nice call Obama.

Almost over! Can't wait
 C
Who ever is is charge of passing information to the President pass this tweets to him. I m waiting and I'll never stop fighting
Martin and Shoemaker should in prison for taking upon them incriminating information to cover their assess. Someone must act
I am asking you for a second chance to prove that SPC is innocent. He will never admitted that he is culpable of the crime.
You are a lawyer Mr President. GOV broke all the protocol and amendments of the constitution when he was charge with the crime.
Shonk presented as a hero. A real hero is a person with character Who will give his or her life to defends the other lives.
Judge let that go DNA proves that my brother Is innocent and court denied as prove of innocent. Martin a lier and ex convict.
No gun powder residue no witness only the testimony of a corrupt soldier who admitted lying in front of everyone in court.
I m asking for help.Just investigate I m not asking to set him free without proving his innocent but I want the Gov to prove it
I am fighting for my brother who is serving life in prison for a crime he didn't commit. If you have so much respect for woman.
what did u do for black america, not a dam thing. You are the worse president ever. Never make that mistake again.
Hopefully, a big step forward will be taken in the upcoming Election.  Hillary promises to bring 100's of Women into Government
why isnt there a mens equality day?
@Ksenias7
and you have done so little for this movement over the last 8 years in years
#Ronaldgod
even here, men get offered opportunities before women who are in many cases more qualified-#stillHoping
@DevimenonDevi
then tell HRC to pay the women at the clinton foundation the same as men for the senior positions in the foundation
- when will workers be treated equally with management.
yes..u r correct .mr president ..sarathliyanage1234 @gmail.Srilanka
What's the status of the violence against women act?
Noticing difference is one thing , we need to equalize as per the creation of the nature. Respect for equal partner of life.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for honoring women.
love you and my goodness I am going to miss you being our president
o.k. my mother is wonderfulle, I love¡

hilary presidenta

@shaukat_as We want same for our sister Dr Afia Siddique. No justice.
# THEBESTPRESIDENTAMERICAEVERHAD
let's stop taking donations from countries whom disgrace women. Like hilary. . It's a solid start
Happy Women's Equality Day
indeed
Es el ideal. Todo ayuda, tahnk you very much and best regards :)
what right does men have that women don't, it would seem men are lower on this scale. #equality #nationalwomensday
by bombing women and children indiscriminately, you have shown your equality.
@HillaryClintonAm a proud Dem born in #Wyoming #EqualityState, but I agree, Mr.(and Madam) President, still much to do.
And to think it's the women who have the children & not the men, I think women are the more superior & men lucky to be alive...
it will surely be better, with a woman as President of America. God bless America
thanks
they are treated better then men, you must have your eyes closed
"All animals are equal / But some animals / Are more equal than others"
In 1920, women were granted equal suffrage in the US. Today, women - even manifestly corrupt ones - can stand for presidency.
مساء الخير سيدي الرئيس
قال لي أحد الرجال الصالحين هل متأكد أن الناس أحبوك أو أحبو عملك ولماذا تخلو عن مساعدتك أذا أحبو عملك
, That is very true, Honorable President.
cant wait for you to leave..just a terrible president you never treated black people fair..look at Chicago since you are in.
.@BarackObama Darn tootin'! Women should not be awarded beads in New Orleans or Lake Havasu for merely exposing their chest area!
you are biased Sir
sooooo....how about ratifying the #UN #CEDAW?
Yeah, we can start by requiring females to register for Selective Service, as males now are.
When will you get around to men's reproductive rights, male genital mutilation, legal bias against men, male homelessness, etc?
You have done nothing.  It is only due to the efforts of woman than have improved their status in life. The credit is not yours
.A mothers voice is the first voice heard by every human. To disregard the voice of a Woman, is an injustice 2 humanity!
Next step is ours. We can take it of leave it for someone else and complain that there is still a problem. Lets move forward.
Yes but when will attention turn to the inequalities faced by dark skins in education, housing, work opportunities, 4 starters?
@MagesaSamuel nini hiki obama
Sir,I still don't understand John Kerry's visit to only nothern Nigeria and their govs Very suspicious to the  christian south
.@BarackObama Straight up! Let's re-shoot the new Ghostbusters film with half male co-stars!
.@BarackObama Nailed it, my friend! We need to offer Mens Study degrees alongside Womens Study!
who really has it harder in the USA...average man or average woman?
.@BarackObama Not sure how to deal with the suicide disparity between men and women. Do we encourage more women to kill themselves?
Better to take them so close,,than to make them equal with men.its impossible Sir.they have many lapses in life{prgncy,menstrtn
