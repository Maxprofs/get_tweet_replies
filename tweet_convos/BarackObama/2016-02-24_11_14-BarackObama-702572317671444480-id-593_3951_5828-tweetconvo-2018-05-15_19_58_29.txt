@BarackObama This kind of obstruction was your VP's idea.
@samluce @thankGo7 How So?
@theAuthoritah @thankGo7 Biden said several years ago that if Bush 41 picked a supreme Court nominee in an election year they would fight it
@samluce @thankGo7 What source?
@theAuthoritah @thankGo7
@samluce @thankGo7 I really don't understand why people that claim to be Christ like, can't discern the truth, & constantly spread lies.
@theAuthoritah @thankGo7 Every news report I read says nothing about what you are saying. Not trying to be devicive. What's your source
@samluce @thankGo7 I'm saying A. Taken out of context. B. Irrelevant. I need to learn more. At worst its hypocrisy which is a GOP virtue.
@BarackObama Mr. President @POTUS I'm sorry people have treated you with disdain. I thank you for many reasons.Proud to call you President
@msugrl33 @BarackObama @POTUS ...boohoo poor Obama, we all feel so sorry for him and his executive orders. all hail emperor Obama! @FoxNews
@FuchsKim moron. Read the constitution. it's all about their hatred of him. They don't give a shit about doing the right thing.
@mariesuzy executive order, that will be reversed next election is not doing the right thing.  I guess u think name calling is right thing
@FuchsKim name calling=emperor Obama..LOL. Yup. he's ONLY president who's issued EOs.
@mariesuzy Eos that courts have struck down or halted.  And I don't think I called u a name, but u did. I think Obama can defend himself
@FuchsKim Ur picking/choosing what is constitutionally right thing to do. Strike down BOs EOs, but NOT pick SC justice. How conservo of u.
@mariesuzy very presumptuous of u.  I voted for Obama, not in GOP, and I have posted potus should nom next scotus.  Think first then post
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@samluce That's bullshit Sam. As always propaganda. I looked into it. You didn't. And u spread misinformation. Like a good Christian I guess
@IrishinNOLA It is unconscionable and reprehensible! Kick out the GOP in November!

@Jmpm48Philip @msugrl33 @BarackObama @POTUS ANYONE out there ever heard of a place named "Watergate"? I do remember every POTUS since 1963.
Again, I beg to differ...
JW Prez @TomFitton: "Key Obama spying scandal docs are over at the Obama Presidential Library. We’re considering legal options to get them."

@CharlesMcCool @twitter @BarackObama
@fireguy_bulldog @CharlesMcCool @twitter @BarackObama BarackObama Doesn't matter, vowing to obstruct process, waiting 4 new POTUS is WRONG!
@GreenPeaches2 @CharlesMcCool where does the constitution stipulate a time period for the senate to act?
http://youtu.be/73tGe3JE5IU 
@fireguy_bulldog @CharlesMcCool    average time in past less than three months
@GreenPeaches2 @CharlesMcCool I didn't ask the avg time. I asked time reqd by constitution. Hint - there's none
@BarackObama @juanrea421 Is MMCc finally doing his job? Thanks M.!

@BarackObama but yet it's OK for you to obstruct justice and not do what's right for the American people. How about you resign immediately?
@BarackObama @Senate_GOPs Stop the obstruction!
@BarackObama @DanielAFee1 REMEMBER WHEN @VP wanted to do the same thing in 1992? What's the difference? HE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT NOW!!!

@BarackObama completely!
@BarackObama leave it open Senator McConnell
 Americans have your back.
@BarackObama there are a lot of people who would say the opposite. Just because it's the presidents opinion doesn't make it true.
@BarackObama Actually, Joe Biden set a precedent a while back.
@BarackObama had to share this on my site. Thank you! http://rbl.ms/1Ag1rup 
@BarackObama Your vice prez did the same thing back in 72  but that was different right  BLAHHHHHHHHHH

@BarackObama 
this sounds familiar; I think it's what Republicans said when Dems wanted to block both GHW & Gw Bush appointments! Hypocrite!
@BarackObama Mitch McConnell #DoYourJob
Barack Obamaさん

This kind of obstruction is unprecedented. 

Thank you very much

@BarackObama #DoYourJob

@BarackObama you don't elect Supreme Court judges on election year!!!!
@BarackObama Mr President,you are doing what is right,the others are too angry to see the light. Truth and decency is required M. McAngry
@BarackObama   IF YOU HAD DONE YOUR JOB WE WOULD BE IN A FAR BETTER PLACE THAN WE ARE NOW!!!
@BarackObama @ThosChamberlain As soon as we're through telling McConnell he's irresponsible, let's tell Trump he's rude.
@BarackObama @Bvweir you know regular ppl that don't do their job suffer consequences from a write up or termination.
@MikhaelCarrigan @BarackObama @Bvweir too bad thats not an option with McConnell at least for another 4 years
@DavidC78514 @BarackObama @Bvweir term limits for congress!!
@MikhaelCarrigan @BarackObama @Bvweir tried that and they were ruled unconstitutional and good luck trying to get an ammendment for it
@BarackObama What's difference, Presidency has been virtually unoccupied for past seven years!
@BarackObama Yes! Congress needs to do their jobs. Republicans, in a word can be immature!
@BarackObama That is why you filibustered Alito, your VP advocated for exactly the same thing, you hypocrite
@BarackObama I am disgusted by the way Republicans in Congress are behaving.  There is no logical excuse.
@BarackObama Mitch McConnell is a nerd, twerp who should be recalled...He's UGLY, too.
@BarackObama Tell Chuck Schumer too pls
@BarackObama So proud of my Senate. #DoYourJob
@tonydunn Also a credible option.
@BarackObama Haven't seen this kind of obstruction since a pigeon ate a brick of govt cheese. I hope the results aren't as messy.
@BarackObama @SenateMajLdr Must be nice to have taxpayers pay you to not do your job, Mitch.  We elected Obama twice.  We've already spoken.
@BarackObama some people have a deep darkest in them that can't be purge with reason and logic...my generation will hopefully remedy this.
