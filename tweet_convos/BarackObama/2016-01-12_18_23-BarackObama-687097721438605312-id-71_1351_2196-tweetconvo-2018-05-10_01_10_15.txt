@BarackObama To all the tweeples "worried" about the under-counted unemployed, its time those gop governors acct for those big biz taxcuts

@BarackObama YOU'RE AN AMAZING MAN! You've done good things for this country! Don't let anyone take that away from you or your name! #SOTU
@BarackObama   Too many are part-time low wage jobs
@BarackObama @white_21 this is a lie. So many people have fallen out of unemployment and are no longer counted.
@Lantz_16 I suppose I may have jumped the gun in retweeting, I should do some research first.
@white_21 I want to know are you really going to vote for Hillary given her email and Benghazi history?
@Lantz_16 I feel like this is just kinda a "meh" election, there's really no on candidate on either side that I'm overly wild about
@white_21 I think this is THE election of our generation. We need a strong presence in the office. I don't see that from a Dem. candidate
@Lantz_16 the next months are gonna be interesting that's for sure, and you could very be right.
@white_21 I honestly wish the @GOP would cut the field to 4. We need more information from our top candidates. No one cares about Kasich lol
