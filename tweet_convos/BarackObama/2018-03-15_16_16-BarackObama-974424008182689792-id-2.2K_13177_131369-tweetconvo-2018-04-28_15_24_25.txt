Congrats for being the best President ever!
Omg, right? I miss having a smart, articulate, capable, President. The disparity between @BarackObama, and Trump cannot be expressed.
We are talking about a tournament bracket... a pick that many experts said would be an upset. Not our country or economy lmao.
Do you really think it's not obvious to us that you're talking about basketball. Lol I have 3 brothers.
Lol idk. You’re telling him how smart and brilliant of a president he through a reply, to his tweet regarding the NCAA tournament. 

I feel you tho. No worries!
I’d love to see his bracket lol!! #releasethebracket
He tweeted it yesterday
Barrack or Donald? I was talking about DT releasing a bracket. I’ll check it out regardless. We already know Barrack makes a big deal of his tourney pickings.
Please come back!!!
Well it must feel like a group hug with 1000 likes a minute.

You are as good a March madness picker as President. Good job!!
Can't wait for your Supreme Court nomination

Have you heard “He's My President” by DJ Burn, The song Trump don't like #NowPlaying #np #hiphop #cardib #dj
Anytime you Tweet about anything, I am in love! Miss you so, so much!
Yes, anytime he tweets he makes us happy and updating his life.
Right?
Yup! You know it!
Me too 
Me too. And I’m from Germany! is it weird?
Maybe?
Please, sir. Come back!! Have you no mercy?
I see that -:) although he struggled slightly with gun violence he managed to write something thoughtful.
Well done Obama
We miss your intelligent leadership President Obama! Even a dead skunk could run the USA better than that orange lunatic currently in the White House.
Ok, I’m asking you because you’re the first post I noticed on this thread. How are people such as yourself able to post such a long reply within seconds of the tweet going out? Or—am I talking to a bot?
Makes no sense. I’m asking how he and others are able to post significantly long replies within seconds of the tweet. By the time I even see the tweet, they have already posted 280 character responses.
You need to meet my daughter. 280 in three seconds flat.
That’s impossible. You’re clearly exaggerating—by a lot.
By a little. But not as much as you think.
Trust me, I have a 16 year old daughter myself. I know how fast they can text, but I highly doubt she could type out a full 280 character tweet in under a minute. If you say she can, I’d love to see it. Just video her doing it. Don’t have to show her face, just hands & phone/pc.
Miss you as President..
We all do. 2004 was a year he ran for Senator in Illinois, 2008 was elected in the midst of a awful recession and then reelected with an energetic yes we can.
Yeah 
It's a promise he holds. Ten years ago this November we witnessed history.
True 
Yet here we are stuck in 2018, with mass shootings happening. He was nice to offer a heart to Parkland. That is caring. Thoughts and prayers do not help
We love you!
We all do!
Omg Barack just tweeted Loyola and I am right near Loyola so it’s like he tweeted me 
me too!! edgewater athletic club.
Yes we are pretty much now BFFs with him 

 That is very very funny.
Sir,  I admire and respect you.  You showed the greatest dignity, poise and competence of any President in my lifetime.
I miss the days when ye were President. God bless
It’s actually illegal. If Obama was VP, and something happened to Biden, Obama would then have to become President. But, he can’t, due to 22nd Amendment stating only 2 terms.
I believe the law is actually about consecutive terms? Meaning Obama could absolutley be president again because Biden's presidency would make 3 consecutive terms impossible?
He wouldn't be president for a full term and there would be time between Biden's presidency and Obama's.
Or am I just super wrong about this? I'm looking at some other comments and I'm beginning to think I am 
Not to mention Michelle would murder the poor guy 
O! But the joy I felt when I saw this tweet... the hope! I just so wanted it to be true.
I remember driving one day and having the thought that this might be possible... I pulled over to google it and was crushed  but #Biden2020
And @MichelleObama as VP!
Miss you
I don’t
Great contribution.
Had your bracket saved in the queue ready to fire away. Saved by that shot!
Barack... how could you?
Congratulation!
Very few people I know had Miami winning that game, and the last four minutes highlighted why.
I miss u being the president
We all do. Many of our current supporters of the "other President" are either clueless and doesn't actually know how much he did to our great United States.
I don't ever call Trump President he's not worthy
Smh...
?
I often look at this picture of you. It gives me comfort. Ty
Love that pic of him too.  I know it’s corny, but I almost didn’t want to add another ‘like’ to your post to avoid ruining your perfect #44 likes.
glad you did 
we miss you Mr. President. I wish you could come back
Miss you, B!
We do too!
Come to loyola
GOATbama Confirmed!
This made me smile. I miss the carefree days of March Madness and football season when you were President. You are so sorely missed. I will always see you as a great father, husband, Christian, and President. Thank you. P.S. I hope they win!!
THE G. O. A. T. !!!!!!
I miss you please come back and be our president
YESSSSSS!!!! MY PRESIDENT

Finally a Presidential tweet thats uplifting in some fasion!

I've forgotten normalcy.....
You are appreciated!
I don’t understand, I tweeted congrats to Loyola and Sister Jean as well, but got zero likes. I guess I’ve got to up my Twitter game, Mr. President.    PS  We miss you.

Love and miss you so much, Mr. President. Your tweets help keep us determined and upbeat. Geez, we’ve got so much to do, so we need lots of Barack-Hugs too. Love to the whole beautiful family. 
Congratulations for being the best president ever.
We love you and miss you more we every passing day. You are a true leader and you lead with caring and compassion  
We in Bharat had a high regard for your vision. But it seems that in the present context the things are so inter mingled that it becomes a web and it takes a lot more perseverance to solve the things. But time is ticking and one gets under pressure.
This is literally the only thing i have ever disagreed with you on. #gocanes #thanksobama
Could ye pick us a few winners for the last day of Cheltenham Barack
Welcome to the bandwagon Barack!
You are still my president. I miss your leadership and kindness.
Ditto

I have them winning in my bracket! I wonder what percentage of the country missed that one?
So awesome!!
Pretty please!
Just as good at judging on the basketball court as he will be on the Supreme Court.

I have no idea what this is about but I just love you President Obama!!
The NCAA Men’s College Basketball tournament. He picked a lower seeded team in his bracket and they won.
No one cares
Guess you’re dead wrong on this one. Read the comments. We are all ecstatic just to hear from him!  I don’t know from March Madness, but I love he’s  into it.
This has me so hype
Go duo with @Ninja #GodsPlan

Sure thing Barry!
barry
Save us @BarackObama. Our country is in serious trouble. Glad you are enjoying March Madness but we need a voice of reason. 
We need it more than ever!
You were an amazing president please follow
Please follow me
pay my tuition pls ;/
@SNEricThomas
Humble brag your bracket isn’t busted
A house divided - we enjoyed a great game #MarchMadness
How do we arrange a phone called between @BarackObama and Sister Jean to talk hoops? Interested CBS producer asking 

Your bracket was busted after the first game tho!

I made the same pick, maybe I can be president someday.
get off twitter and investigate benghazi
Not enough for the sweet 16? Come on, man.
IM SORRY WHAT!
Did y’all’s President tweet about your school, I dont think so
You and my 7 year old son.  You are more scientific, he just picks on colors and the way the team name sounds to him.  He is the only one in the house to make this pick, he is acting like a cool cucumber.
This stung Mr. President...because I’m a ride-and-die Miami fan  #CaneGang
Just go away please.
@firejlp #FireJLP
@realDonaldTrump and KANSAS are going to #upsetcity this #MarchMadness

We MISS you, Mr. President.
The world misses you. More than you know
It hurts to see my Canes go down like this, but the game was exciting and a true reminder of how much fun March Madness can be.
Haha I picked Loyola too, for absolutely no reason at all.

With Oregon being aggressively mediocre this year I didn't pay any attention and filled my bracket out in about 10 minutes.
I need to see your board @BarackObama post it

We miss you best President WWE ever had

Sorry, UM fans, but I'm cheering for one of my favorite schools! Go LC!
Hi, sir you are a very good and kindly man, I am impressed you

Barry, how does it feel to retire early?  Putin just got six more years!
Saudades de você, meu caro Presidente. Nos tempos de Trump, cabelo pintado retira o requinte que a White House já possuiu. Não sei.
Way to go Loyola
Love you obama...
Mr. President, did you have Syracuse over Michigan St?  How about that #SU zone that is more than a zone? Brilliance. #JimBoeheim is a local hero in my hometown area in #CentralNY. #GoOrange & blessings to you & your family.
