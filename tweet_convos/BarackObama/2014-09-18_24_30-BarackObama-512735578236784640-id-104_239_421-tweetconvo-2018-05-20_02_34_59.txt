@WhiteHouse and what are they@ paying for?  Most cover nothing
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Even with insurance who can afford the high deductibles That's why insurance costs so much. dr's overcharge
Health care should be free to all Americans. You can't pay taxes if your dead.
@WhiteHouse: "Almost all Obamacare enrollees are paying for coverage." http://huff.to/1r2Mdao  #ACAWorks #GetCovered
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama the hell with Obamacare, repeal it along with Obama the traitor. #impeachobama #MarineHeldInMexico
@WhiteHouse I suppose you could consider subsidized premiums as being paid by the insured. If no payment is req. you can not be delinquent
@WhiteHouse His this a good thing for the people?Why would any one in their right mind be against healthcare for all people ? Please !!
@WhiteHouse One more GOP talking point bites the dust!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yeah but 90% can't afford our coverage and we are going to have to drop it!!!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Good day Sir

@WhiteHouse glad to hear it. should be more. anything more can be done to increase coverage?
@WhiteHouse I'm also working on my insurance
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse and we pay for your services every time you go to the emergency room! !!!!
@WhiteHouse also I pay 700+ and it's still cheaper than I can find  elsewhere. I assume you naysayers don't have insurance at all.
@WhiteHouse I have never had any doctor deny my coverage through Obama care. It's BCBS and I doubt they even know where I bought it.
@WhiteHouse You still don't answer how many of those were forced off their health plans by Obamacare? Sad really sad
@WhiteHouse This is just another lie. No numbers. No reliable sources.No transparency. = No credibility.
@WhiteHouse good.  Job....D

@WhiteHouse How much carbon does your jet spew wen you go on vacations?
@WhiteHouse  That 7.3 million number is incorrect. Does not take into account how many didn't pay or quit paying after the first payment..
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@whitehouse @barackobama Im paying for coverage,  and I feel protected by The affordable care act, #Obamacare,#works, thank you President.
@WhiteHouse OK, there's a big difference between paying a premium, and having your premium subsidized. Also, collection to payout ratio?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama An even the ones not enrolled in it. and costing taxpayers way more than you said. N cant keep crap thanks liar
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama but we have to pay the prescription more expensive than over the counter and paying every month and co pay
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What will the GOP frighten people with now.  Perhaps a well oiled death panel?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I want single payer!  Or that private insurance pays 100% with no deductible or out of pocket payments
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @obamacare  See who #ObamaCare is failing  Michèle and Maris http://goo.gl/HKW5Dj

@WhiteHouse even the #medicaid recipients? How so?
@WhiteHouse Does that include the people that lied about their income and the ones who can't verify citizenship and the ones we subsidize?
@WhiteHouse So? They're not paying the true cost for that insurance.
@WhiteHouse it's a good thing!
@WhiteHouse Are they paying the full tab because I'm not in an exchange and my cost has more than doubled you #Socialist thief.

@WhiteHouse with welfare checks
.@WhiteHouse Everyon'es paying for coverage, whether or not they're actually--you know--covered.
"@WhiteHouse:"Almost all Obamacare enrollees are paying for coverage." http://huff.to/1r2Mdao   #ACAWorks #GetCovered"
@WhiteHouse Single-payer is coming. The insurance "industry" makes nothing but profit for themselves, and misery for everyone else.
.@WhiteHouse Let's move on 2 "people before profits" #singlepayer universal health care. Healthcare not health insurance company domination!
@WhiteHouse hahahaha.....not me
@WhiteHouse and those of us who opposed it are now paying the subsidies.
@WhiteHouse I understand it's hard to find a doctor that will accept "Obamacare insurance". Let me guess, you have never heard this before.
@enoems @WhiteHouse Tv there has been in the fritz...
Weird, @WhiteHouse Twitter account links to story that says #Obamacare info is lacking and a computer still isn't operational.
@WhiteHouse For the first time in my life, I've had my insurance cover all my dental costs (with x-rays!) I am so thankful. #ThanksACA
