@WhiteHouse that's not what the GOP (American Isis) believes Mr. President! Keep up your great work! Hope congress stays in vacation 4ever!!
@heredia4027 @WhiteHouse When you see John Boehner beheading someone on Youtube, then make the ISIS comparison.
@MrSugarButt @WhiteHouse you mean like the way they are trying to behead woman by treating us like the Taliban does their woman? Stfu
@heredia4027 @WhiteHouse You win the Internet today for the most stupidest fucking tweet I'll read all day.  You obviously don't know shit.
@MrSugarButt @WhiteHouse really? Please point out the "most stupidest" tweets I said please miss Boehner
@heredia4027 the one about treating women like the Taliban. US women today have more rights & progress than at any other time in our history
@MrSugarButt and why do you think that is ignorant??? Obama!  hahaha!!! If it was for Bonner lol we wouldn't have a say about our own body!
@heredia4027 what legislation has Boener proposed that would limit women's rights? You do know what the word "legislation" means, right?
@WhiteHouse This isn't the 50's anymore. I wish someone would tell me what rights men have that women don't.  I'm waiting....
@MrSugarButt @WhiteHouse Women are being raped at universities and not protected. The *have* the right, but it's being violated and ignored.
@UnkelFred @WhiteHouse there are already laws against rape. Maybe current laws should be enforced, eh?
@MrSugarButt @WhiteHouse Yes, Yet the police and courts seem 2 be reluctant 2 prosecute in many instances.  Difficult 'cuz few witnesses.
@UnkelFred @WhiteHouse it'd usually liberal judges whose concern is more for the rapist and what happens to them in prison than the victim..
@MrSugarButt @UnkelFred @WhiteHouse Who cares whether it's Lib or Con? It's a fact that it happens either way.
@1untamedbrain @UnkelFred @WhiteHouse feel free to give me an example of how women are losing rights.
@MrSugarButt @UnkelFred @WhiteHouse Not losing anything, they're discriminated against. Here's a list.
@WhiteHouse Fox News hosts w/big smiles because of the rise of economy. But... Benghazi lol
And I can still see Russia from my house haha
@WhiteHouse @alliewienerr says what study
@MattLang4L @WhiteHouse common sense
@alliewienerr @WhiteHouse noooooo... Gender isn't relevant to politics. It depends on the individual, not the genitalia.
@MattLang4L @alliewienerr @WhiteHouse just poppin in to remind u gender =\= genitalia ok carry on love u
@oliviadesanfoot @alliewienerr @WhiteHouse I know I'm just being a dick bc I agree with her but blatantly agreeing isn't my cup of tea
@MattLang4L @oliviadesanfoot I think we all figured that last part out long before today hahaha
@alliewienerr @MattLang4L you're a fuckin goofball
@oliviadesanfoot @alliewienerr I'm VERY feminist.
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson think it won't
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson that's why it's messed when people say we need a good leader.  if the person was good they wouldn't be involved.
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson #goodkarma

don't pretend it's not that simple (black and white)
“I need to succeed, so she can succeed, so WEEE!” “I get it, Bob...” “Can succeed!!!” #IncrediblesTwo #JuneIsMyBirthdayAndImStoked
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson  really if women succeed than only we all can succeed.
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson important point. if they weren't good before, then they aren't now.
 
im not fooling anybody

on my way to #greatkarma
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson the moment you stand there, you are a failure.
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson in the end any government run society will fail.  period.  it can't possibly not fail.  the key is they make people...
@WhiteHouse @BridgetOFlynn Now that would be falling on Abbott's dead ears!
#Women of #Syria, their freedoms, their opportunities, their equality - all ignored for war! @WhiteHouse @EmWatson
@SusanDirgham @AliasHere @WhiteHouse @EmWatson My interpretation of Syrians was they were Secular, the women were professionally educated.
In Syria, women enjoy freedoms +equalities comparable to women in west @Dingie4366 @AliasHere @WhiteHouse @EmWatson

@WhiteHouse Very true. Women have a lot of potentials put in them by God. So they must be considered  in all areas.
@WhiteHouse @EmWatson But there's one thing, 'he for she' is actually mutual understanding concept not power accessing authority.

In order 4 women 2 truly succeed, Equal Rights Amendment MUST be ratified. Mr. President, how long must women wait? @WhiteHouse @ERAAction
@Katrinas_Dream @WhiteHouse @ERAAction A constitutional law professor might say you need to wait until 43 states vote in the affirmative
@fauxODPChairman @Katrinas_Dream @WhiteHouse we have 35 ratified. Need 3 additional states.

@WhiteHouse We know this because of the success of first world countries, so stop saying this ABOUT those first world countries.
@WhiteHouse 4 those not understanding the difference: #EqualRights 4 women may be the law but it's NOT a cultural #FaitAccompli or #Mindset!
