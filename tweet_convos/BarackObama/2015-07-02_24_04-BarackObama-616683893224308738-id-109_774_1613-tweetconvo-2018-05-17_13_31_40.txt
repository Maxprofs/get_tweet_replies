@BarackObama bull shit! Trickle down explains the economic boom of the 90's, your liberal shit explains the false bubble we're in now #Pop
@GrahamInglish I suggest you read up on economics. Trickle down had been proved to fail over and over and over again.
@greecebaII so now I have a Canadian teaching me econ LOL "read up on economics" lol bet you didn't even go to community college #GetFucked
@GrahamInglish you are correct. But that's because we don't bother with community colleges. We do have university's that teach Economics.
@PuppyaGuineaPig @BarackObama Not that I disagree, and I assume you exaggerating to make a point. But you studied economic theory at 10?
@PuppyaGuineaPig interesting childhood indeed. Well, I commented on a few misguided GOP lovers  who hail trickle down. I'll point then to u.
@BarackObama bottom line is that you do not have a clue bho

@BarackObama Keynsian economics doesn't work, Barry
@BarackObama raising lower class grows the middle; preventing rampant greed at the top creates mobility.
@BarackObama you should get a bald eagle as a pet , and let it rest on your shoulder all the time.

@BarackObama it worked for Reagan! I guess you have to have experience in the executive office to make it work.
@mddixon87 @BarackObama do you do research or do you just spit random pea brain arguments?
@WhatsYourThesis @BarackObama I have a degree in global business my friend. One of my instructors worked for Reagan.
@WhatsYourThesis because of NAFTA (1994) sent US businesses over seas. Call centers and manufacturing.  Those $'s are used overseas.
@EF517_V2 @BarackObama I also second that opinion.  @POTUS
@BarackObama It makes sense
