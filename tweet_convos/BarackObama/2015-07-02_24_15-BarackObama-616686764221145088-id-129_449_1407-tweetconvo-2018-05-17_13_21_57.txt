@BarackObama The playing field will be made level when MINIMUM WAGE goes up to $15.00 per hour!
@BarackObama The playing field is not level, the workers always lose. Your corporate overlords have made sure of that...

@BarackObama This post alone, clearly shows you don't want "level" fields, and equality. (cont) http://tl.gd/nk6p8d 
@BarackObama Absolutely !!
@BarackObama 
Yes ! And that's why We need another President Reagan !
@BarackObama This country is founded upon Equal Opportunity, not equal Outcome! That's up to the individual not the government!
@BarackObama Let every American live the life of an African or an Indian for a day and then decide if the playing field is level for them.
@BarackObama it is credit worthy only when you win on a bumpy field loaded against you...anybody can win on level playing field.
@BarackObama good
@BarackObama Just be honest and say "workers of the world, unite ." Vladimir Putin is a true Christian; you're a phony Christian for Sodomy.
@BarackObama yeah? Well when is that? Playing field hasn't been equal since you took office
@mknoetgentaylor @BarackObama That's crap! It hasn't been fair in ages!
@BarackObama It's not level! Companies don't want to pay people their true worth of the level of work worth. Middle class needs better wages
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama please dont talk about american workers winning after what has happened with the TPP, but otherwise good job on everthing else!
@BarackObama don.t forget the Dutch mr.President
@BarackObama What hell kind of level are you using? #Truth
@BarackObama I would like someone to define that ambiguous phrase 'level playing field'. I think it needs untangling.
@BarackObama well once America has destroyed every country it touches there be no field at all.. Congratulations

@BarackObama HELP  x Venezuela  SOS  bacii my Presi
@BarackObama no we don't because taxes go up and everything else goes up, and the gas companies start price gouging
@BarackObama But the playing field isn't level. That's the problem
@BarackObama so this means that countrys that sign #TPP agreement their workers will LOSE. Then its not a level playing field is it ? #NoTPP
@BarackObama we should just have the govt control all the wealth. And divide it up evenly. History shows that's a great idea!!
@BarackObama and the clock is ticking
