@BarackObama We could spend that money on making preschool & higher edn free for all! Good pre-K edn would probably reduce incarceration!
@SpeechTherapist @BarackObama and you get like sweden. The system protect the criminals. If you do 100 crimes you get discount on 94.
@thundergutsu @BarackObama There is plenty of research showing that punishment does not lead to learning even in children.
@SpeechTherapist  they still sit in a prison. They cause more resources out on the streets. Our justice system is a joke.
@thundergutsu If it’s not working, it needs to be changed.
@SpeechTherapist well the majority does think so too. But it takes time. We have to light crime punishment. You can get 1,5 year for a rape
@thundergutsu Does Sweden have capital punishment?
@SpeechTherapist no we dont, we have life but that can change to a time-scentence
@BarackObama Mr. President, I have a suggestion
@BarackObama Blk cop pull me over and let me go cause I'm lagit. White cop 2min later pull me over a give a ticket w/o asking questions....
@BarackObama I lay on the ground 4 a traffic stop, searched, jail for a traffic ticket, framed, and more. We know the truth!
@BarackObama If we spent $80 billion improving their labor union induced shoddy education think of what a difference that could make.
@BarackObama Mr president you still keep quiet on all this killings in Biafra land by president Muhammad Buhari of Nigeria.this is hate
@BarackObama You should free the murderers. No logical reason to keep them in prison since murder is already legal at Planned Parenthood
Please change this system, so my son can have a chance to work, instead of returning to the streets to make a living.@BarackObama
@BarackObama @YouTube thank you for protecting us from the criminsls
@BarackObama good job Mr. @POTUS
@BarackObama Wonderful! :-)
@BarackObama is this really the  preasident
Mr. President how can I get you documents.
I need some help .
@BarackObama There are three Black Men from my community doing life in prison for having a thimble of cocaine. #ghostdope
@BarackObama You are an egotist. You think you are very intelligent, but World leaders mock you. The racial unrest is encouraged by you.
@BarackObama yes and they come out worse, and every year you push our nation trillions of dollars closer to collapse.
@BarackObama  We need you to visit the prisons in Phoenix, where there is a revolving door policy to keep Afro-American & Hispanic lockedup.
@BarackObama  I'm all for that Barack Obama I'm  a person who change his life around for the better I got charity for the youth no help
@BarackObama #How did you like Newark I'm from there my dream is to help the youth in my city but no help
@BarackObama Do it already then.
@nico_w1992 @BarackObama true that
@BarackObama @YouTube our country definitely  needs to reform our judicial system
@BarackObama I am so disappointed with our government.  you're not supposed to put our people in prison for money. We should not be for sale
@BarackObama Black budget drains more money than inmates. We don't need self-flying fighter jets.
@BarackObama California's AB 109 Public Safety Realignment Act of 2011 released 50K "non-violent" parolees and was an unmitigated disaster!!
non-partisan fact-in California, the early release of non-violent, non-sexual, non-serious criminal offenders is NONSENSICAL!
@BarackObama 
Perplexed who are not a danger should  be given work for community service.
@BarackObama 
That's a waste of money.
People should not want to return to prison.
People should try hard to avoid prison.
@BarackObama don't you just hate the world and long for Jesus kingdom
@BarackObama you don't seem to mind spending hundreds of trillions of dollars on other things!
@BarackObama But what about the state of Ma. We have the same issues. Do you care about My state.
@BarackObama  We need to bring back the death penalty on verified DNA tested prisoners to eliminate the taxes paid to take care of them!
@BarackObama  Black men in America receive harsher sentences than any other race, and come out to rejection.  There is no hope!
@BarackObama College courses in prison could help, in addition to agreements with outside business to hire these people. There is disparity!
@BarackObama Should add your name to the list.
@BarackObama And Your the President of the Untied States of America. That means You should proctect Every State not few
@BarackObama they could abide by our laws as could you and they wouldn't be locked up. You? You are privileged.
@BarackObama And every year we spend thousands of lives taken by ex-convicts. Women, erderly and the most vulnerable Stop easy parole system
.@BarackObama ... in order to profit massively from slave labour. It's a brilliant scam https://youtu.be/dS9Vxt3yQdk  
#prisonindustrialcomplex
@BarackObama Good point, Mr President. Why have laws? You don't worry much about following them. Why should we? Waste tax payer $ on police?
@BarackObama Y'all just wait until Donald trump becomes president. Y'all goin be on your knees begging Obama to run for a third term.
@BarackObama It is absurd. Real criminals belong in jail. Minor offenses can be handled in ways that help society.... Legalize Marijuana
@BarackObama that's because one of the few jobs  entrusted to gov is to protect the populace from criminals not set them free upon us
@BarackObama remember it's politicions who make the laws that these people breakalso the penaltys,, think about it
@BarackObama apaan mksdny cant u speak in indonesian? Im soft-tack from indonesia
@BarackObama Can't wait til your term is up. The worst President in the history of this great nation.  Should be ashamed but you won't be.
@BarackObama you took an oath to defend the constitution should be charged with  perjury changing laws at will.
@BarackObama 500 billion on your 5 soldiers in the middle east.  Such a hypocrite. Your legacy will be the worst in American history
@BarackObama shut up
@BarackObama Out of 1.7 million prisoners 1/3 R illegals immigrants. Let Mexico pay for this . SEND THEM BACK ASAP & pay off our debt.
@BarackObama you spend more than that on your golf outings
@BarackObama Afgan people can't afford to even use $43M gas station cuz wld have to convert their car! Cost $800 Annual income is $700! wow!
@BarackObama Talk about stupid spending! YOU SPENT $43 MILLION ON A GAS STATION IN AFGHANISTAN!! One that shld have cost $500 thousand WHY?!
@BarackObama how much to put u in jail where u belong
@BarackObama We could put an end to money once and for all, alleviating crime and poverty, here is how.
http://socialrebirth.org/money-to-resource-based-economics-step-by-step/ …
@BarackObama maybe they should lock u up for ur crimes against the USA
@BarackObama maybe they commit more of the crimes maya. Check ur facts dummy
@BarackObama poor criminals have to be in jail . Boo hoo stupid
@BarackObama Once again concerned with addressing the heart of the problem. The best President of all time.
@BarackObama Maybe they could work in the federal government.  Wait, many of them do!
@BarackObama Maybe we should find another way to get rid of murderers, sex traffickers, rapists, & drug dealers. How about execution?
@BarackObama I can't say anything......
@BarackObama California is one of the worst!  Visit our prisons and look at the countless inmates with sentences that are way too harsh!
@BarackObama Sometimes a peace officer's transition to a lawyer, disdains Maplewood, turns state, skipping speech class. That's got his own.
@BarackObama how much do we spend on the war on drugs? We have a lot of rethinking to do!
@BarackObama Im on board
@BarackObama legalize marijuana and that number would drop but privately owned prisons would lose money so you won't.
@BarackObama parents spend on drugs using food stamps as money, could care less about their kids.
@BarackObama please visit Mississippi
@BarackObama money well spent compared to the money you waste on stupid things
@BarackObama  I am sure there are 1000's of better ways to spend tax payers $$$
@barackobama @ChuaJuiMeng.. dont b 'afraid' of change.. it is part of being versatile in an ever challenging, rapidly mobile world.. wlcm..
@BarackObama Didn't you mean to say we "invest" $80 billion.
@BarackObama The problem is a direct result from the anti-religion crowd. People who regularly attend Sunday School tend not to go to jail.
@BarackObama let's set them free.
@BarackObama More community interaction, decriminalization of many substances, no private prisons. That money could make real change.
@BarackObama WHY AREN'T YOU DOING NOTHING TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THIS 21 yrs THAT IS GOING TO BE EXECUTED BY SAUDI?
@BarackObama It all starts at home. The first five years are so important.
@barackobama: i feel happy for everything you do and god bless you 4 every point.
@BarackObama A common sense based criminal justice system.  What a novel idea.  Addiction is an illness not a crime.
@BarackObama. Huge monet which would better help poor people in the Developing countries.  .
@BarackObama can u help me ? I want to come America i have no mony and no visa i belong o a poor family i sale daily newspaper lahore thanks
@BarackObama so do something about it before you leave office!
@BarackObama start eliminating them from the gene pool fool.
@BarackObama ya were that belong..
@BarackObama 
What does it cost to keep all politicians in office?
@BarackObama can we look @ the # of tax $s spent on marijuana crimes nationwide and how that translates to lowering Ed loan 4givness? Etc?
@BarackObama Do the time for the Crime not for time they already done you don't get Six years because you got 3 years before .
@BarackObama Jail "business" owners/investors need profitable incentive to reduce their inventory. Only way to derail a grass root system
@BarackObama #Governments #WarOnDrugs.  How about a #WarOnJobs Oh wait #EPA is doing it #DOJ has a #WarOnPatriots #IRS #WarOnConservatives
@BarackObama Use the stroke of your pen and make open carry a federal law and let them all out and the public will take care of the problem
@BarackObama gudaguda man
@BarackObama  Keep up the good work and GOD will look down on us.
@BarackObama incarceration practices must change.
@BarackObama you're good at profligate spending. Maybe if you spent more crime would go down.
@BarackObama I love you Mr Ptesident with all my heart you are the best !!!
@BarackObama hope you had a nice Halloween also sir
@BarackObama well it is hard to tell what the money could be used for but there are certain points that could be brought up to discuss about
@BarackObama  Since 2007 Mr Aamer, who claims he was tortured, has been cleared for release twice, by US presidents. Shame on your nation.
@BarackObama try reforming the accountability of our past secretaries of state.
@BarackObama The role of gov should be to protect my life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness and not to punish how I exercise that right.
@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama any hope of restarting the Superconducting Super Collider project?
@BarackObama How many life we save with these people incarcerated - PRICELESS! How much Tax $$ we doled out for Free Obama phone & Welfare?
@BarackObama Let's put the $ into education/vocational job training!
@BarackObama or you can skip a vacation and save $50 billion..
@BarackObama So do it
@BarackObama I hear you're starting a program to hire criminals to work in the White House? Of course not! Just turn em loose on others!
@BarackObama Letting criminals out to go on to commit more crimes isn't the answer. Big country, so we need bigger prisons, death penalty.
@BarackObama I wish they can use 80billion to lock up all my country's corrupt politicians..
@BarackObama It'll change b/c Koch's went too far w/ALEC laws & they want to look great as the leaders on reform; not b/c of POTUS' position
@BarackObama POTUS did nothing to stop Corporate Fascists from implementing those Corporate ALEC laws that did this to us & never will.
@BarackObama Maybe they belong there. Keep the drug pushers/druggies off the corners trying to recruit the little kids to sell their wares.
@BarackObama I love it!
@BarackObama #stupid President
@BarackObama Why not spend it on regeneration of neighborhood? Or is that too socialist for American taste?
@BarackObama benim is bitti mi?ben büyüdüm mü
@BarackObama so we need to use our politicians money to keep them there.  They don't know how to handle money anyway
@BarackObama, great job so far I am proud of you and very happy with your work so far.
@BarackObama, Mr.President:
Why do we always support the wrong side in Middle East?
I expected that from republicans not you.
@BarackObama Non U.S. citizens should be sent back to country of origin, do we revoke residence permit for crimes???? If so what kind
@BarackObama The only reform we need in the justice system is to stop the  incarceration of  our African Americans and Latinos citizens.
@BarackObama what the hell is your point? They broke the law andthat is where they should be
@BarackObama And you waste our money on your vacations and handouts for terrorists that want us all dead. Your point?
@BarackObama @NoGOPNo It costs about $40K a year for ea person in jail we should pardon anyone in jail for smoking pot
@MouseBarbara @NoGOPNo @BarackObama and nearly all NON-violent crimes..just use community service... lots would get done.
@BarackObama 
Stop putting people in jail for petty stuff
@BarackObama we need to know why people commit crimes in the first place. Find out the root cause & tackle that.
@BarackObama They nèed to earn their keep
@BarackObama As an art therapist and teacher, working with PTSD youth from dysfunctional families we need to teach resilience.
@BarackObama 
Some minor non-violent criminals might be let loose, but most of them convicts deserve to be where they are.
@BarackObama I admire and respect your initiatives for criminal justice reform. I believe it is the compassionate approach.
@BarackObama The money should be spent upgrading VA hospitals. My daughter who is a veteran had a stroke, had to be moved away from family.
@BarackObama if u execute the death row prisoners should save you 60 bill  then 60billcould be used to house homeless vets!!
@BarackObama all I see and have seen from you is a stack of "Bills of Sale". #MostIncompetentPOTUSEver
@BarackObama Raise your hand for Libya
@barackobama Your a great President, keep our bases and fleet in the Middle East but get everyone out of there.  We simple can't win.
@BarackObama It's way past time,just like our education system.Be a man.Make cannabis legal.Let the innocent free.there's a start.
@BarackObama You need reform on justice how does cops get away with things that get other people fired from their jobs
@BarackObama #Overdue I am sure all of America can agree that the time is now!
@BarackObama perhaps...how much cost have you put on the lives they destroy for their drug? How much for their second victim when released?
@BarackObama If this truly concerns you then end the war on drugs. No more playing games with futures. Mandatory minimum is wrong.
@BarackObama what you want to do?turn em loose and tell them to not do it again
@BarackObama   I like  you.
@BarackObama   Yes bet we spend 1.7 trillion on the cost of crime!  Why don't you focus on rebuilding the family and respect for the police!
@BarackObama 
80 billion spend on good education..would do a lot better for the country
@BarackObama It is a National Shame that our Congress has not put YOU there.
@BarackObama and safe from them
@BarackObama @BarackObama how much will it cost the tax payers to reprosecute
@BarackObama legalize marijuana, especially medical marijuana. Would cut down on these insane sentences.
@BarackObama that's a lot of money if drug related simple only hard core should stay I agree with you on this
@BarackObama legalize marijuana and let ppl go with marijuana charges.
@BarackObama https://youtu.be/3pxkN269XLg 
@BarackObama in jail because of a crime committed that is justice to the families their crimes affected. Alive they cost $ dead the cost 0
@BarackObama oh ur solution just leagalize them and release them.  Way to go u idiot.  Ur last statement is justice for all. They are
@BarackObama 
What about the injustice and brutality by police. How bout start there. Instead of revictimizing people. Open mental hospitals
@BarackObama 800 billion is spent because we give them all free healthcare and give them to many rights. Plus how many illegals in jail.
@BarackObama that is a great thing to do, keep up with the good job.... God bless you
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Thank God. Some people need to be kept out of society.

@BarackObama Crime does pay

@BarackObama let's clog the prison to pipeline save Richard's life.ccps is killing his educational dream
