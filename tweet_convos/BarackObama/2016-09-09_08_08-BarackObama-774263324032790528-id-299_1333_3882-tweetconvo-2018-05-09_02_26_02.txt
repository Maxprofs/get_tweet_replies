Mr. President, "affecting" is preferred over "impacting." Sorry for the edit. @RealiTeeChick @MaryNorrisTNY
LOL! Now you're on his list!
That's fine. If @BarackObama were to hire me as a freelance editor (I need more work), I would take the gig in a second!
Unfortunately the job would only be temporary.
This is true. But he is a terrific writer and I would love to be involved with his forthcoming memoir on his years in the WH.
Apply for the job!
@barackobama, @RealiTeeChick has suggested I apply for a job as an editor for your forthcoming memoir. I like the way she thinks: hire me.
I'll even vouch for him!
I'm really going to miss you.
okay
,I really miss you.
@nytimes You had 8 years to address this issue. Al Gore warned you 16 years ago. What?

@nytimes Sir, Awesome place and looking great
Mr. President, science issues theories and what if's. Yet politicians who understand little want to forward solutions.
kindly visit our website http://www.nitrompg.net . Call country this formula in all fuel distribution
Remember: God is in control of climate, air, nature. The human being has its limits.
nitro mpg is a registered formula with the EPA that has been tested by Compliance and Research Services, it eliminates carbon
@nytimes Your Efforts n Contribution in dealing with Climate change is remarkable.May others too follow you to save r planet.
dont do me any favors
“@BarackObama: We must take bold steps now—climate change is already impacting millions of people. http://ofa.bo/2czxiBK  #ActOnClimate”
Assume climate change is Muslim  ,now you go fast to take that bold steps and no one will stop you Mr @BarackObama .
bullshit aliens are terra forming our planets atmosphere to thiers he's using it as an excuse  wake up stupid humans have
@nytimes well first take some humane steps to save the Muslims of syeria and iraq then think about climate change
Of course! Climate change has always been impacting people on the planet. Nothing new. It's called: "Nature"
then PLEASE Mr President - #StandWithStandingRock and say #NoDAPL

Capitalists need climate change or their business will be subdued!

You are nice, thank you very much!
@nytimes 因为贝爷的越野千里吗？没让你吃虫子好可惜。

@nytimes @SgyYogarajah Hon Sir !WHAT IS PATHETIC IS MANY OF US DO NOT KNOW THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS YOURS KNOW & FEEL

ya Sir you are right

@nytimes what about #standingrockrez ? They are fighting for the environment and climate. Please step in and help! #NoDAPL
@nytimes yeah they are terrifying, science has been screaming that fact for 15 yrs!!
@nytimes Really? I'd say the $20T debt is having a way bigger impact. Why don't work on that first.
@nytimes climate change .. So when do animal ag supporting subsidies end and animal ag producer through consumer taxes begin?
@nytimes not affecting unwanted babies. # scalpelsandvacuumcleaners
Agreed.

And wow on that photo. Isn't unspoiled beauty in nature an incredible spectacle!?!  Idyllic.  Amazing. Peaceful.
to me TERRORISM IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
@nytimes well it has nothing to do with terrorism
meanwhile #NoDAPL I'm sure pumping a bunch of oil that we can burn for fossil fuel is great for the environment.
So is the US REALLY interested in solutions or is this just another misdirect ?
I offered this to DARPA and they won't even grant a meeting, 15 years worth of work and not even 1 serious inquiry
I make trees grow on 1% of normal water needs in drought zone 4. Shrubs, hedges. And organic food on 2% at 95% less cost.
Give me 15 minutes Mr. President I will show you how to grow food in drought on 2% of water at 95% less cost and make it simple
#ActOnBenghazi #ActuallyJustActOnAPoliticalPersonLikeWeActedOnWikiLeaksAndOtherMilitaryPersonnelWhoLeakedDocuments
There are solutions (real Adaptations) but no one in government is ready or willing to even look at them, unless they are M.I.C
Then ban fracking across America & stop the pipelines as your one last good deed , talk is cheap #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife
@BrianDrummondVO I'm thinking of doing that, change to a different climate. This one here sucks.
@nytimes Müslüman müminler seni hiç affetmeyecek.ölene kadar ortadoğuda öldürtdüğün çocukların ruhuseni bırakmasın.Lanetle anıl
