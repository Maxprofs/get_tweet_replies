If you appreciate Obama for helping the people of Puerto Rico in this desperate time, like & retweet!
This is my President until further notice...
Over 50% of Americans don't know that Puerto Ricans are also Americans!

#HelpPuertoRico get the help they desperately need! Like & RT!
If you want @ElonMusk to set up solar hubs all over #PuertoRico to help them recover from this catastrophe, like & RT!

#PuertoRicoSolar
Please!!!
Thank you for knowing that Puerto Ricans are Americans too & suffering, unlike Donald Trump.
Thank you for working to bring us together to help, rather than tweeting about the NFL while Puerto Rico is without power.
Thank you for being presidential while our current president tramples on the Constitution and ignores those in need.
Trump is SO callous that even when he did talk about Puerto Rico struggling, he made sure to mention that they OWED MONEY to Wall Street!
Thank you for not being a Grade A jerk while our fellow Americans suffer.

Thanks, Obama.
You have to add that Puerto Ricans are Americans too, otherwise the Trumpers will have no idea what you’re talking about
ALL DUE RESPECT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE, & THAT THEY MAY NOT KNOW IS EXACTLY 1 OF THE TRILLIONS OF REASONS WHY HE SHOULD NOT BE IN PRESIDENT 
#ImpeachTrump ... he is a danger to America.
#LockHimUp worst President.
Do you follow people just to troll them on Twitter? Surely you and your fellow baby boomers are above that.

I love seeing these 4  men together. They've formed a bond on the side of Humanity. Horrible decisions made by one guy; people Can Change!
They all seem rather good now compared to #tRump but 1 man stands alone and will always be the best of the bunch ... we're lucky to have em
That Man is such a Humble, Genuine, Intelligent Human Being. Those are Real Smiles; Obama's smile is infectious 
@HMiglino is on a roll with the #awesomeposts 
When the going gets tough you call on a President not a washed up bankrupted ex Reality TV stunt man
Who essentially tried to Contact out Disaster Relief to his Rich Buddies. The FEMA just outright Lies about Puerto Rico while he talks NFL..
On top of all that he's charging those poor people who have lost everything .. Charging them to be rescued by signing a promissory note.
I love how you all never invite Trump to these things… keepin’ it presidential 
Dotard insults Puerto Rico while people are there dying. He still hasn’t figured out that it’s a U.S. territory…
I wouldn't put it past Trump to add Puerto Rico to his travel ban once he discovers more brown refugees will flood into his WHITE AMERICA.
he cannot justify that...it is PART OF U.S. forever
Trump doesn't know that tho… he just learned what an island & ocean is
I read his trump golf course got denied...so this is personal vendetta--he is making the island pay for the slight  #PuertoRicoRelief
This....
I love Lainie right now...strong ovaries of steel...
Thank for doing the right thing and doing things right..!
The REAL presidents 
Thank you, sir, for still leading and helping in this abysmal vacuum.
Thank god! Some torsidente that have a clue! We are with you PR! #PuertoRicansAreAmericans #PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicoStrong
*Presidents
You are sooooo missed. As a Puerto Rican, I am so grateful that you and other past Presidents still care.  Thank you.
Thank you for your continued service to our Country. We miss you and your family
I miss you
Not even our President anymore and yet he still leads better than our current one.
Yes, Mr. President.  I hear you are donating a large piece of that $400K speaking check.
We? You and the globalists? Thanks but dont keep the funds this time. #BPOilSpillFiasco
I need proof that you are doing anything but vacationing and playing golf. If your lips are moving you are lying.
Barbarabot, why are you talking about Trump's golfing on an Obama tweet?
Bravo, Mr Presidents!
They should let U go bk 2being Prez instead of the Trash we hv now
Please come back!
Thank you Mr. President!
Thank you Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. President 
I so love seeing the ONLY living REAL presidents unite!!!
Thanks to all real presidents for getting involved in saving Americans. Our fake president is too busy to care. @POTUS
...he’s playing golf!
And meanwhile, it's 3pm & people in PR is in dire need of help, so we ask, where is the sitting president & what is he up to?
Endangering America.
How much of your own money have you donated to any hurricane victim, Obama?
All the best.
Come back!!!!!
Wow. Obama has a much better tweet than Trump "PR has much debt that needs to be paid back, bad infrastructure"... pathetic. Thanks Obama!
Thank you. We love you.
Thank you President Obama! We love and miss you and Michelle 
POTUS
Thx past Presidents !!!!!!
Thank you Mr Presidents. When the US had actual presidents.
Appreciate your leadership!! 
Sorely needed!!
Thank you Mr President

Ex-Presidents are doing more than our current President for ALL natural disasters. One People.
These past Presidents, whether we agree with their politics or not, are our heroes. They are more presedential than @POTUS will ever be
Boy I so agree .. I just shared to my FB so I'll see who crawls all over me .. 1st time I've ever thought a president was inept & evil
Let 'em crawl. We must continue to speak up!
My momma taught me people was basically good & ive been doubting that lately ..
'Were' oops
Help Puerto Rico,  share now
when you're being a better president than our actual president
Thank you 44, for doing what 45 is OBVIOUSLY too busy for, while he panders to lowest common denominator. 

Miss you a bunch. Come back! 
Thank you Mr. President! I love and miss you!

Not an American Citizen.  Should be jailed for treason against the citizens of the USA.
Mr President. The San Juan Mayor was on TV begging ANY COUNTRY to please help #PuertoRico ppl are dying. Can you please help with that? Other countries could help can't they? I am now begging you to please ask others to help.

Just finished the English/Spanish 10 am broadcast on the #MariaSOS Zello channel w/@CrowdRescueHQ . Anyone with hands, they're needed.
It's worse than anyone is saying on regular news. Entire communities without water. Advice on handling of the dead/animal dead. Very real.
Thank you.
Thank you & @BillClinton, Bushes, & Carter for showing the leadership to save lives while #Trump is busy tweeting.
We know you could find Puerto Rico on a map. Not sure ‘45’ can do the same.
"it's an island surrounded by big water" ...
Love you, Mr President Obama. 
Thank you to the Real Leaders in the world for stepping up to help save lives! This is what humanity looks like! 
PR's Mayor is being TARGETED by AltRight-NAZIs. ASTONISHING to watch FANATICS radicalize & RECRUIT Americans under the GUISE of free speech.
&has SuperHuman capabilities2transcend all the fake news shit that was/is slung at him by the current Cheeto Turd Nero @realDonaldTrump
who is lurking about the White House after shamefully selling out the Country to Putin @realDonaldTrump
You allowed Puerto Rico to remain corrupt under your watch Barry stop the BS your not a nice guy Mr con man
I just gotta say, can you imagine 45 in the same room with these Presidents? #oneamericaappeal
It’ll never happen. trump dies in prison if he’s lucky enough to not be executed for treason.

Love. Stealing.
Yes! Get it out there!
Thank you for always being classy & a PRESIDENT for the people - ALL people! You are sorely missed. #PuertoRicanRelief #PuertoRicoIsAmerica
WTF...why r former presidents (citizens) doing more for PR than this orange mofo!! Why r citizens making more moves this trump's admin!  WTF
I don't know the answer to that but I'm sure they are in capable hands with the former vs the current.
I agree!!!
I SENT $200 3 DAYS AGO 
I have donated to help Americans in Texas, Florida, and PR as well as our friend Mexico  I will continue but I wish I could do more
You should just run for president again, the one that replaced you is dangerous and very orange

Lol trump is a horrible little man. It was sad to see Obama and michelle leave
Tell me about it Obama is articulate compassionate intelligent everything that twat isn’t
Yep exactly that. Now u got trump n his wife n she can't stand to even look at him. I feel sorry for her
I don’t feel sorry for her she knew what she was getting and she remains complicit in all the fucked up things he’s doing
Deffo but now he's president I think she can see how much he doesn't care. She looks so ashamed of him
It’s called divorce no excuses if it’s toxic to be around him then do stg about it. I have no sympathy lol
Thank you for continuing to be a Leader of The Free World and a Beacon of Hope for America.
S/o one of the best president America had to offer

Thank I
Your not expanding your efforts. Why don't you call on eliminating the Jones Act then? This is what the people of Puerto Rico actually want!
Obama was the leader of Al Qaeda and ISIS. Asking Him for something is like asking fire to stop.
It is amazing how you can overcome an ocean. A really big ocean. Thank you President!
Thank you Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President and Mr. President.
Blows my mind Jimmy Carter's still kickin. He also hasn't aged in about twenty years
Thank you President Obama for showing us what a real leader looks like. America mourns you. There will never be a greater role model. 
I miss you
Thank you!!
Please save this country ...
Thank you for your leadership & humanity, Mr. President.
I claim my generals. -OO
Well I it’s good that a few ex-Presidents are still around to provide some leadership and support to the country while Trump golfs... 
Thank you

Love it! Thx! 
God damnit. There's not one president from the past who I can say anything negative about now. Trump is just the absolute worst
Thank you,  gentlemen - your leadership and empathy exemplify American values.
@liberallisa Thank You President Obama!
@WtfAmerica4 i cry knowing what we had a real President.What we have now is a Orange clown.We sure do miss u President Obama!
The same people in this country love you and miss you and your wonderful family!
Now that's a true leader stepping up and stepping in to take action while the Divider in Chief talks more shit and golfs' the weekend away!
thank you!!
HILLARY CLINTON would've been there already, dropping supplies into remote areas from a PRIVATE HELICOPTER, if she had one. #TrumpsGenocide
It's not Trump's fault that Puerto Rico is corrupt & as badly run as it is.  

TRUTH BOMB

Thank you all Mr. Presidents we miss you all so much!
Thank you!
Thank you mr.president for not forgetting about the USVI. We r americans too.
Made a contribution today to support PR & USVI. T/you for your leadership in this humanitarian effort.
If I was a millionaire I would do more and still complain that it was not enough.
Unlike trump!
Can you pls just be president again? 45 is barely in the Oval Office anyway. Just... come back and save us?
WE MISS YOU!!!! 
Newsflash: You are no longer President. Your opinion is invalid. Go live your less than glory days with your "wife"... Or, just GO away.
We miss you. A real man. A real leader. A real president. For all people.
A!! True!! Leader!!! 
Go to bed Obama

The PR governor debunked your efforts to paint Trump as not helping. You & HRC are piggy backing
Hey Barry..
Hes the most fit & most reliable & most sought after potus in history. Stop listening to brainwashing #FakeNews. https://twitter.com/Md_Renegade/status/888559755387654145 …
Mr.  President I commend you and the other past presidents for stepping up to the plate and doing something for PR......
I have one ask not that any of you have not already given up enough for our country because you have.  This country is now in serious......
Pls manage ur $ hands on. Zenkie's buddy got a $300M contract some will b in Z's pocket FEMA in Houston gave $74M to a co that disappeared
You all are scared of JUSTICE BIAFRA?
#Support_Kurdistan
#ادعموا_كُردستان
Not the President anymore but still doing the work of one.
Thank you. America needs your leadership.
Yes sir
Trump is a sorry excuse for a #POTUS!
Thank you President Obama. You are stepping into the void the odious excuse for a president, Trump®, has exposed.


San Juan mayor: "I am asking the President of the United States to make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives"
Sir, please. There's no more time. Please help.
Jerks!
Thank you, Messrs Presidents, for showing true leadership and caring about suffering Americans.
Funny, trump doesn't know he's the pres of PR & USVI.
Still my president.

I LOVE YOU OBAMA
How much did you all donate? What efforts? I don't see anything you all have done.
Pls refuse division but embrace the anger on the middle, their looting must be stopped. They are the backbone of peaceful democracies. 
PS thank you for being an great person 
You really should listen to your kids dad because S'S were polishing Dunkin Donuts Baskin Robbins Critters based on veese beat Dunbar 32-0
Aren't S'S supposed to protect the President so why protects HW and cops woke me up two hours get out fuel truck and geese sounded CA 1:14am
The way the Clintons helped the people of Haiti?
Hey everybody, a legitimate POTUS sent out a very presidential tweet! 

Hey @realDonaldTrump He’s legitimate & you’re illegitimate!
Glad that someone recognizes that they are Americans
Thank you sir. My heart hurts for the citizens of PR.  Oh how I miss having a real leader for our country.
Thank your for including ISVI - they need some attention, support and  too.
Why didnt you do anything in your 8 years to prepare your island territories for tragedy like this? Not just you but all previous govs.
It's a shame the current president isn't doing anything
I vote we all just pretend  you are still in charge. 

If we let Trump keep Kushner and Ivanka and Twitter he may never notice.

Nothing but respect for my president!!
We miss you so very much. Pres Obama, I know you're looking back & thinking 'I shld've told America regardless of that treasonweasel Mitch'
I miss each n everyone one of you. God bless
Our current "@POTUS" is playing catch up, though.
Thank you President @BarackObama. 
Thank you, Sirs, for your joint leadership! YOU represent the BEST and TRUEST of American values! We can be proud of you!
We must  care 4 those in need especially bc the 1 in charge" is incapable! One self absorbed is unable to comfort and support those in need.
Wish you could call the guy in the White House and tell him what he needs to do before alot of people die. God we miss you!!!!
@rzrbladecupcake @arjitdewan THANKS FOR CARING
You're the best president. So much class. #YouAreStillMyPresident
Dear President Obama - Can you clear your schedule and make it out to PR and stand next to this beautiful mayor ( @CarmenYulinCruz ) & give the good people of PR HOPE.
Here’s an idea , every citizen in america hand in their guns to local law enforcement, for every weapon handed in, they receive $100 ,donate

5 decent men work around a dog turd on a golf course
My mistake. The fabulous 5!
Oh look, the two worst president's ever and a crook, Puerto Rico should worry!
Miss you
