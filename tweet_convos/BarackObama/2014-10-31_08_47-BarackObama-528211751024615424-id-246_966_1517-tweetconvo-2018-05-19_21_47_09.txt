@BarackObama @southerntalker Of course anything that benefits Americans will HIGHLY offend the Christ-less Repubs who vote against humanity.
@BarackObama Ha, prove it! Go get real jobs for adults NOW THAT IS THE ANSWER!

I learned something a long time ago a goat head once a day is better than a cow head once a year
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage"damn right
@BarackObama damn right so get that shit poppin
@BarackObama All Americans would benefit if you cut spending and taxes. Let's look at that instead.
.@Cary_Cheshire @BarackObama Have to agree cutting spending & taxes is the better option Mr. President. Please consider all options.
@Cynlorrine23 @Cary_Cheshire @BarackObama A proposition beautiful in its simplicity.
. @BarackObama yes indeed - and what about the people in Iraq & Afghanistan Sir?
@dcbrasiel06 Indeed and that should be the priority . Which was my point exactly- Who cares about those Idiots in Iraq & AF  @BarackObama
@BarackObama Ok I finally agree with u on one thing. Now fess up to any of your criminal activities

“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." But people who work for money, suffer.
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage” Haha no.
@BarackObama Its about time one of our presidents took action on poverty wages. I believe n socializm.
@BarackObama they would benefit but the companies won't. Can't have a minimum wage that companies can't support.

@BarackObama So do it! You have the power to. But if you raise minimum wage, then everything else is going to go up.
Yah, probably RT: @BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10."
@BarackObama
Truu “@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”
@BarackObama Have you ever sat through and economics class?  Do you own a calculator? You don't raise wages by legislation.  #workharder

@BarackObama in the short run... @SterlingShogun ... Inflation will follow. #simpleeconomics
@BarackObama It sounds interesting. But let's focus not only in the benefits but also in how this could affect some of the Americans.

@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage
@BarackObama , it's about time
@barackobama
@BarackObama  It is in bad taste to raise it to $10.10 for metaphysical reasons and it's not a good joke even though they get an extra buck.
@BarackObama 
Is it on hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis ?
@BarackObama:"About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage
@BarackObama Why not $1000/hr.? The net effect will be the same, overall costs increase for everyone and nothing accomplished, good work.
@BarackObama president Obama thank you
@BarackObama yeah right. You would never...

@BarackObama hi obama
@BarackObama The minimum wage should be indexed to inflation. It hasn't been adjusted for over twenty years...
@BarackObama  wao
@BarackObama .....Because that's what every body dreams of is there child making  $10.00 an hour . Quit crippling our economy .
@BarackObama I would ask you to rethink this and focus on raising the wait staff to min. wage. >S< OFA
@BarackObama So what happens to those of us in middleclass when prices go up bc you recklessly raise wages for the uneducated & lazy bums?
@BarackObama great decision.....
@BarackObama  hello
@BarackObama  por favor me llamo andres argentina no es cristina busca a ella sola los argentinos somos inocentes y damnificados

@BarackObama Minimum wage blocked by John Boehner. He who relies on people for his existence has not right to continue in this country.
@BarackObama I would be nice if raised minimum wage go head  obama
@BarackObama or we could lower the pay for people at the top
@BarackObama Your have a care in the Russian ...
@BarackObama Mr. President, have You heard of prof. Ravi Batra and his theory of wage gap ?
Yes Obama “@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”
@BarackObama shut the fuck up
@BarackObama yes president Obama
@BarackObama no, people need to not settle.
@BarackObama no that is a lie will only increase there taxes, and raise cost of goods, just like it has thru history
@BarackObama okay but that will also indirectly affect every one else (200m +) in a negative way... #StopThisNonsense
@BarackObama you're a dumbass
@BarackObama Same numbers, professed for #Obamacare, same result - helps a few, hurts 300 million - Democrats are TERRIBLE FOR AMERICANS!!!
@BarackObama question, if the minimum wage is raised that means all goods and services would also raise to cover the new increase.
How bout raising pay of our military first? RT @BarackObama: "About 28 million would benefit if we raised the min wage $10.10" #RaiseTheWage
@BarackObama 
Roughly 316,148,990 people would benefit if you would go hide in a closet for the next 2+years. CAN'T EVEN
@BarackObama Why are so many keeping people from having. A more equitable wage. Greed surrounding profit margins
@BarackObama and what about all the illegals u let thru or borders. Dropping the diseased off randomly. U fkn moron!
@BarackObama only people happy are people that make less than 10.10$

@BarackObama so what's the point in working hard for a good job if you get 10 bucks an hour at mcdonalds?
@BarackObama  I hope all americans would benefit
@BarackObama
@BarackObama people can't make ends meet on min wage even @ $10.10 hr. Keystone pipeline would create jobs
@BarackObama Will companies just raise the price of their goods and services to off set the increase?
@BarackObama where are they all going to work after 30% of their companies go bankrupt trying to pay them?
@jklemak @BarackObama That may be true, but people can't live off of minimum wage. Fruits, veggies, milk, eggs and meat prices are too high.
@BarackObama no.
@BarackObama !hai
“@BarackObama:"About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10."—President Obama #RaiseTheWage”  I'll Pass
@smokbluntz lol not so much, because if goes up that high young people won't get those jobs anymore…think about it as if you own a business
@BarackObama If you EO a wage increase please consider that 10.10 means nothing if gas milk and rent all take a 90% price increase to offset
@BarackObama Visit http://www.people1st.co.za  let's test true existence of democratic state in South Africa, #Citizens to Action
@BarackObama that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. That's  what to do raise minimum wage and prices on everything else goes up with it.
RT"@BarackObama Yes,Sir; #1010Means,Isn't so-much high (v/s Germany',fr ex.!)-,& DOES-Counts,in these #TksGiving #Xmas Periodes !
@barackobama Mr President what stops you from raising #MinimumWage
My nigga!“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”
@BarackObama This would actually hurt way more people than it would help, because everybody would raise prices to cover it.
@BarackObama still a bellend
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”
@BarackObama even that is not enough to live on, but it's a start. here's to starting with $10 and moving towards $17-$20!!
@BarackObama force it through. It's not like you get a third term anyway.
@BarackObama that's a fair increase. Although employers will start making cuts to employees hours.
@BarackObama @yankee7kid And up goes the price of my Big Mac
@jason_kaleta @BarackObama Because McDonalds couldn't afford it.
But the cost of living would also go up. RT @BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10
@BarackObama but that would create inflation! As inflation was at all time high between 97-07 when it was stuck at $5.15... #republicanlogic
@BarackObama Let's go to 11.11?  15.15 would be better... that would create a lot of jobs.  Disposable income.
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama”
@BarackObama  Thats what a responsible president should advocate for.
@BarackObama The evil Republicans can't give a raise of $3.00 for us but we're paying them six figures for not doing anything. Not democracy
@Ashlybsmith @BarackObama That's a 29% raise to a minimum wage caljber employee.  You're insane. #College
@BarackObama that's about 7%-9% of the United States of America.  And it wouldn't benefit them enough to fix their problems for money.
@barackobama C'est pas la grande forme dans les sondages.
@BarackObama @stphil @elizabethforma & how many Americans would benefit if we #RaiseTheWage to $22/hr?
@BarackObama No it would kill millions upon millions of jobs. Minimum wagers do not deserve more... I would know I am one of them.
@BarackObama raising minimum wage 30% will raise prices 30%....there will always be poverty and wealth.  No policy will change this!
@BarackObama stimulate the economy and give tax incentives to businesses that willingly raise the wage. Just saying do won't work as well.
@BarackObama  raising min wage to $10.10 may sound good in theory but practicality is different Mr.president
@BarackObama when the cost of goods goes up as well, their dollar won't go as far...
@BarackObama It would hurt small businesses & put people out of jobs.
@BarackObama hey the president of the universe I really buy,support and use political, social and economic ideas but am Avery poor Ugandan
@BarackObama NO way!! Really? pay one who works @McDonalds over $10? Do you realize a RN w/a BSN starts out a little over $20. @gretawire
@BarackObama but how many companies would suffer?! #justsayno
@BarackObama just round it off sir and raise it to $11.00
@BarackObama how? It would cause local businesses to have to lay off workers, not gain them...
@BarackObama If there is no jobs, what difference does it make? nothing from nothing = nothing if with common core!
@burketg @BarackObama the last time they raised it the country didn't fall right?
@BarackObama so for everyone who worked their asses off to go from 7.50 to 11.50 the past 6 years... Do we get a raise?
@BarackObama but because of inflation...everything will become more expensive which means the extra money won't matter. Just saying.
@BarackObama but what if the price of a Big Mac goes up a nickel because everyone knows companies only raise prices because of wages.
@BarackObama how many small businesses will be forced to close their doors if we increase minimum wage?
@BarackObama: Maybe Pelosi should start since she said people should work part-time!
@BarackObama can't cut taxes, he fixing the hellish debt former president put him in
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama /it will hurt so many
@BarackObama it would hurt so much more people. CUZ you would be taxing the fuck out of the checks. Horrible ass idea.
@BarackObama how does $10.10 bring people over the poverty line again. What can you buy with that? #StillPoor
@BarackObama More than 300 million would benefit if you left office
@BarackObama it would only hurt the rich! And not even hurt, they'd feel sour for a day or two. Then more people be buying shit theyrichagin
@BarackObama WE GOTTA HAVE JOBS FIRST !! ECONOMY SUCKS N SO DO YOU !
@BarackObama oh yes please inflation good thinking dude
@BarackObama he is clueless on job creation
@BarackObama i would love to see it raised but wouldn't that make the stores raise prices?  shame on congress what do they care,
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage. Then watch businesses #RaiseTheirPrices and #ReplaceYouWithARobot
@BarackObama what so they can take our kids away and be missbrle
@BarackObama liar
@BarackObama Inflation
@BarackObama Even then, I just don't see how folks making min wage are making it, even with both working. But for a single person, tough.
@BarackObama if politicians did not receive ungodly salaries for life i think americans would benefit more.
@BarackObama maybe if college wasn't so expensive they could get educated
@cdendler A college education shouldn’t have to break the bank! Check out these 9 tips for college financing:
@BarackObama oh, they say, that wud hurt business. so then we cud hav a max  wage & help business.
@BarackObama like a socialist?
@BarackObama america's red states minions know that just as the government does not have a money problem but spending problem so do they!!
@BarackObama Seems lime a fair monthly income to me Mr. President #POTUS
@BarackObama the other 272 million of us get hurt by rising inflation #RaiseTheWage #basiceconomics
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”Great
@BarackObama  that's big nope Mr.
@BarackObama why not raise it to $50 and help even more than.... Don't you want to help ALL Americans?
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would b... RaiseTheWage” it would be great but I guarantee the cost of living will sky rocket !!
RT@BarackObama this makes perfect sense
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”#takenotes
@BarackObama inflation!!! If prices go up wages should go up. So why don't you raise it. Inflation made it impossible to live on min. Wage
@BarackObama I could've created the ACA site at 1/80th the cost.  At $600mil cost I could've employed 28 people at $1mil/yr for 21 yrs.
the price of a Big Mac meal has doubled in 15 years so it makes sense that minimum wage double as well. @BarackObama
"@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage" @epn
@BarackObama That is what will create jobs!  15.15 would be better.  Disposible income is needed.  Don't creep up on it, go big or go home.
“@BarackObama: "About 28 million Americans would benefit if we raised the minimum wage to $10.10." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”THE TRUTH

@BarackObama the problem is areas where minimum wage is higher than that.
@BarackObama what about the other billion people. Did you forget about them. What about job layoffs because some can't afford that wage?
@BarackObama how many would benefit if it were raised to $15?
@BarackObama plus the ripple effect on the economy (and savings on social services?)
@BarackObama the price of living will go up as well
@BarackObama Agreed
@BarackObama I love you
@BarackObama lol good one
@BarackObama If the minimum wage goes up but the cost to buy things also go up won't make a big difference... Hopefully I'm wrong!
@BarackObama You have to create upward opportunity to higher pay.  Not create entry level jobs for life.  You will ruin our country overtime
@BarackObama YOU HAD BETTER GET A NEW ECONOMIC ADVISOR FOR THE WHITE HOUSE! TRY SOMETHING NEW: GET SOMEONE WITH BUSINESS EXPERIENCE!
@BarackObama follow me please!!:D
