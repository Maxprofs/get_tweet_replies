@bin21o i ll definetly be there

possibly an artifact of reporting, but 2 me it seems random mayhem is also increased. Maybe subliminal effect of environment?
global warming threat is a hoax, another lie from the democratic party
See how that line shoots straight up in the 1900s? That means the average temp is much higher. #firstgrade
lisa, please understand the correlation between co2 emissions and warming
Mr Obama how can you sleep?

ShoUrite!
@ClimateReality so are you even aware of what's going on in your town today #NoDAPL #StandingRockReservation #WaterIsLife

Go viisit Yemen and see what your friends the Saudi's do the with billion dollars of weapons you gave them.

They don't see truth they listen for it they r blind following your lead leaders that is where we r looking 4 1 message truth
@BarackObama

That's all you have Mr. President ? I believe there are far more urgent matters to attend to.
go back to vacation
- what are you doing to help the people of Louisiana?  We've heard nothing from you.  Sad and infuriating.
then please stop filling up airforce one and traveling to exotic places for vacation &wasting my SSN
@lheinkel @BarackObama your stupidity and lack of the subject matter can't be denied!#Democrats #GlobalWarming #COSProject #PJNET #MAGA
Can you help me get my driver's license back, please?
it's called weather
you, your allies #bombing>fire>heat>ozone disturbed>high temperatures
God should have fired Hillary long ago And saved some of your own legacy
..we need to treat climate change issues with urgency.
Not just #ActOnClimate, @BarackObama - it's time to mobilize America like in World War II. http://Theclimatemobilization.org 
Fifteen months in a row of record-breaking heat is a signal that can't be denied: We need to #ActOnClimate. 
To name an enemy is to become someone's enemy. Please emphasize frugality. Thank you.  http://www.meganhollingsworth.com/waildance/war-climate-not-optional …
number are so subjective
@UltraSolar doing our part to help
We need ppl 2 take their heads out of the sand & realize Climate Change is real! How can we prove 2 these ppl it's a reality??
Shh, don't tell anyone that it's actually getting colder ...
What can the Pres do?  It's not our fault they insist on living in historic flood zones! At the very least build on stilts!
just about any graph, paid for by whoever, will show the earth cooling and heating much more than 0.8 degrees, without high co2
the world is slowly switching to cleaner technologies but it can't happen over night and you can't cut 100 thousand jobs for it
Due to the lack of an appropriate response to climate change years ago we must now deal with the results
i would even advocate green house farming on massive  scale as well as fish farming due
all the graphs tell the same thing in last few thousand years. You think earth warming up from the ice age was because of co2?
The changes that have occurred will not go away for a long time even if we put out zero carbon today
Home owners must develop their own gardens and depend more on solar systems for power
I agree!
Farmers will need to develop irrigation systems where there was no need previously We need a bill for this
Farming methods must change if we are to avoid food shortages here and even around the world
We need to fire proof homes as in the structure and as well as the surrounding acreage
We need new guidelines for Home building to support structures that must withstand high winds and flooding
Dear Sir We need to implement plans now to confront the changes that have already occurred.
Remember the News Conf where u were smiling & laughing & U talked about the 400 mil payment to Iran, Mr President U lied again!
Good concept I like
We have a beauty planet 
Climate change
Do something, most powerful dude in the world. Hint: Republican denial is criminal negligence.
Climate change is a thing, the idea that we can stop it is the JOKE
please consider making rounds sir. Your nation is in distress. Treaty infringement, flooding in delta, fire in Ca., etc...
we're working against powers not within our control. Scientist playing part in war against humanity & the decline of r planet
one thing is Sure Nature  can implement  the truth. No matter  who is in charge  Democrats  or Republicans.
@BarackObama
no shit. Wow
thanks you President for all the good you have done for Louisiana God bless you
everyone should just move to SF, it's freezing here. Oh wait they kinda did...
so is terrorism. Baton Rouge is underwater while you  play golf. Not running again. Don't need the photo op #worstpresidentever
this is it, we can't ignore human created climate change any more
@BarackObama
:I have the solution, remove A/C form all gov. Offices.
yes, please sell-me some solar panels too ...
Bullshit
I'm sorry this even has to be a discussion. #scienceoverfiction
#ActonClimate
You are fucking right.
Things gotta change.
What about a consitent worldorder supportable by everyone?
#Humanity
Good day Sir as you choose Hillary Clinton as a candidate of President. Africa are ready to support her. Let her put her mind
How does adding Ken Salazar to the Hillary team help us move forward?
mhmm mlmc w/o1
Civil unrest, record breaking floods, and out of control wildfires.   You're golfing 
Same statistical method as used for unemployment and GDP! Leave out data to show that climate change happens regardless of us!
what can't be denied, Obama administration paid ransom to help a State sponsor of terrorism.
15months of heat proof of global warming? then 15 months of premium increases proof #Obamacare is bad for US.
has ZERO TO DO WITH YOUR SO CALLED GLOBAL WARMING
it's a lie!  Using erroneous data. Rigged to fit your false narrative. NASA admits it's wrong.
Act on climate the way we acted on healthcare? Not thanks. Keep the "change," you corporate stooge. We need real change.
better stop #TPP and #DakotaAccessPipeline. We know US = Olicharchy = Bananarepublic not fighting Climatechange
several days into a major disaster into the #LouisianaFlood and we have not heard from you. #GotGolf #ObamaVacation2016 #OOT
Melbourne, Australia, last night, had hottest August night on record. In 2016 since January-every month hottest ever.
global warming n current climate change is a concern. Developing nations need support from countries like USA
.@BarackObama @Sustainable2050 that's why Obama spent more time directing drone strikes than using influence to coordinate the #climate war
@BarackObama
so go to Louisiana maybe?
i might have the solution,i just lack resources
@boatzilla Then act. You're the president.
Mr Obama how can you sleep?
WE NEED TO GET U OUT OF OFFICE YOU ARE BY FAR THE WORST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO AMERICA ELECT A BISEXUAL 2 OFFICE MISTAKE
Get awake, the Sun is ruling, #Climate as the actual topic is just business... @HenriBontenbal
@AnnPettifor maybe stop flying around in a massive jet and 20 car motorcades to go golfing might help for starters...
yea we'll act on climate as soon as our politicians yield to the people instead of corporations @BarackObama
unreal, your blaming the President for the weather too.  Learn how to spell ya'll.
Maybe people need to read the news and know your team and you're actually doing their job!
http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/latest-evacuation-urged-louisiana-community-41478191 …
go barak
hopefully you can make a difference if you haven't already
Oh yeah, do more bombing to get stable climate.
True, but these long years to transition towards sustainable energy need to be shorten. Global  #ClimateEducation is key.
This coming from a man who can't even recognize that there has also been 15 mo of increased ISIS attacks. Little more urgent
http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/donald-trump-heads-louisiana-tomorrow-wile-obama-vacations-hillary-rests/ …
Agreed Mr. President! Please, lead and carry along the weaker ones too...
please stage a coup and declare yourself King. It's what is best for America. Thanks.
Then stop flying around in your giant airplane hypocrite! #TrumpTrain #MAGA #FeelTheBern #Obamalies #IAmWithHer #IamWithYou
@Ay_Lin83 Trump says 13 high-ranking CIA officers helped in Turkey’s “Failed Coup
true. Pls recognise the role of developed countries in having had contributed colossally to the problems of environment.
then implement swacha bharath 
yes! Help me out in this bro. I suppose you are as indian as I am.
no fracking
@Greg_Ingleright let's not ignore the warning
Cali drought can't be denied pretty soon we will be a desert like AZ
After freezing the account, the account you request the money remitted back to the United States, because I do not get a dime.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
freeze the account as soon as possible. I swear the witness.Request you have to do. remitted back to the United States tobefast
& what exactly triggered the end of the Ice age? Let's be good stewards of our planet, but don't use pretexts to fleece people.
suck it deniers!
not effective but just hang out with others
@BarackObama
Oh crap here we go again with the sky is falling! we have better things to worry about http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/cnsnewscom-staff/foreign-affairs-chairman-it-was-ransom?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cnsnews&utm_term=facebook&utm_content=facebook&utm_campaign=n-obama-ransom …
So why push more drilling, pipelines and fracking?
Please go to Louisiana.  Show your concern and support for the people.  Then use it as a talking point for climate change.
Yup. Thank that 1 per center or Republican politician for the LA. Flooding. Non believers.
huh?
@SillyWeil Seen this @TurnbullMalcolm ? #climatechange #auspol
He'd say: "Huh ....... uummm ...... nobody told me!"
Hey Scotty check with Dutto & let me know if there's anything to worry about will ya...@BarackObama @TurnbullMalcolm
Just calm down, winter is coming. It`s OK. Just go play some golf.
It's very easy to deny it. Just take a look at the actual evidence from actual scientist who are not payed by the government
Louisiana was wondering, how's your golf game.
Shame on you!
15 months? Are you shitting me? Just finish your vacation ( your welcome) and get out of office
everytime you bring this bs up i assume you either sent money or weapons to terrorists or mexico.
how about working on lowering the National Debt
still denying the "settled" science.
https://Instagram.com/p/BJRRf1hBwS6/  not with your own permtion
Good swing at golf how about the USA oh down the drain with pepsodent
no more denial!
You are right!
Yet U approved 10000 heavy polluting #fracking sites off Calif coast, East Coast & GulfofMexico??! #LipService #ClimateChange 
You're absolutely right. It's time for magnetic engine compulsion and NO MORE internal combustion. This world can't sustain it!
( so very true go Hilary )
