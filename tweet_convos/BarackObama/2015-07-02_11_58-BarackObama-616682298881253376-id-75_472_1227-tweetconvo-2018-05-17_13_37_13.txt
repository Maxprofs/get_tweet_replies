@BarackObama Thanks to you and DEMS for OBAMACARE
@BarackObama because people are forced to sign up!
@BarackObama anyone can do that by mandarory IT!
@barackobama  I agree with you Mr President Barack! !
@BarackObama I'm "Still" 1 of the "Uninsured",and it is not by choice but by "Lack"!
@BarackObama Mr. President, that's not because the working class can afford it, it's because we're being bullied with tax penalties!
@BarackObama The poor DO NOT pay insurance companies. PERIOD.
@BarackObama It doesn't work and your the worst President ever!!!! #obamasucks
@PackMan88 http://j.mp/goeos  Annoying that some phone companies take $ from bills paid to fund liberals. Help us reverse this!
>@BarackObama @maritxa_diaz71 In Great Britian Everyone is "Insured" and Medical Delivery has become a Hell Hole #ACAWorks to Drag Down USA
@BarackObama Got the five-star review, "It's even dedicated to the uninsured people of the US."http://amzn.to/164Aevr 
@BarackObama Commander in Chief--African Americans Need A Flag in the UN ASAP--We are being Executed by the Courts, Prisons, Police etc...
@BarackObama The flip side, we now have fewer doctors and individuals going into medicine than ever! Nice work "mangling healthcare" bo.zo
@BarackObama premiums have skyrocketed
@BarackObama yet were still blind as to whats in our food
@BarackObama I don't think so .My
Son is not one of the lucky. Why
President Obama? I need an answer 
Please.
@BarackObama you should had forced a ceiling on the insurance company's.  NOT force Americans to buy your healthcare.
@BarackObama it really depends what you consider insured.
@BarackObama What is the 'rate' for those cant afford to go to their doctors even though they technically have coverage?  #Premiums2High
@BarackObama I'm sure forcing people helps that
@BarackObama oh come.on. quit lying
@BarackObama funny what happens when you extort your own people.
@BarackObama High deductible plans should not be considered "insurance". Current ACA policies are hurting the families that voted for you.
@BarackObama These policies are hurting the very families that voted you into office, who trusted in your word....TWICE.
@BarackObama Who is paying bill? food stamps,welfare,disability,health insurance,OBAMAPHONE?Japan,Greece,USA worst debt 2 tax ratings in red
@BarackObama If you followed Australia's Medicare, you would have found the doctors & hospitals bulk bill the government so poor get it FREE
@BarackObama where do you get these numbers?
@BarackObama and at the same time prices go up for those who work and those who choose not to are getting health care free.
@BarackObama What is crazy is this sounds a lot like #HouseOfCards wanting American to Sacrifice. I like my truck and House at 69 degrees
@BarackObama In other words, the Affordable Care Act insurance is MUCH TOO EXPENSIVE for the POOR, which is why they are still uninsured.
@WestgarthEnt @BarackObama No there are red state hypocrites like you that refuse to expand Medicaid because you hate the poor.
@BarackObama ارجو ان تقف مع غزة بفك الحصار
@BarackObama that's because they've been forced to get insurance at insane rates.. Smh
@BarackObama @JC_Varela #cumbre @leo2gs # bestcase #spokesperson #supporter

@BarackObama Thanks to the Republicans trying to protect insurance company's profits, the uninsured poor CANNOT AFFORD to pay the insurance
@BarackObama big medicine loves you for sure now!!
@BarackObama I wonder how people will remember you 20, 40 years from now, Mr.President. Will all your efforts really benefit our country?
@BarackObama  BENDICIONES Y SABIDURÍA EN SU IMPORTANTE LABOR.
@BarackObama Good job!  Thank you Mr. President!

@BarackObama It has its own merits Mr. President. No insurance company can indirectly influence policies like how they do here.
