It's baby murder. Why don't you call it what it is? @BarackObama @OFA
ur just probirth, not prolife. If the kid's gonna grow up in a bad home, mom shud have the right to termin8
i grew up in a bad home should i off myself? What about 3rd world?
Did your parents despise and regret your existence?
to really despise your own offspring is a mental HEALTH issue and i touched on that..i am against frivolousness
if u travel the world as a translator or journalist u probably shudn't have a kid. No1 should ever b forced to give birth.
well put but should the pain of abortion substitute b control? in this advanced medical state abortion is stone age
why not both? We have a huge overpopulation problem. Any way to mitigate the "in the way" people is fine by me.
@OFA lets see just how stupid the reasons r to abort money, bad mood, someone other than mom will be mad, scared
some reasonable reasons: real health issues. Rape incest thats about it for me
@OFA A woman should not make the choice to reproduce if she's not ready for the responsibility. A life is too high a price.
Yes, that's what it's all about: that she should have choice, not be forced into giving birth. Very good.
What I'm saying is she should not engage in the act that could get her pregnant in the first place.
No! No sex for you! Bad female!
Not everyone is ready for abstinence, but not to do so means to deal with the consequences.
Best Prez ever!
gotta sacrifice babies somehow! If not with artificial rituals, then why not with abortions right? Q. Is who pulls ur stings?
@OFA Everyone should fight to protect woman's right. I am also ready to do so in every moment.
@OFA Will always fight to protect women rights and men lives!! Women reproductive choices are theirs, only!!
I don't mean to take anything away from this post but please grant me a full pardon to receive my drivers license back in Iowa
@OFA Will always fight to protect women rights and men lives!! Women reproductive choices are theirs, only!!
@OFA Woman's right to commit murder.
@OFA Abortion is murder.
@OFA After we take the nation back, Barry & family will live abroad for safety.
I am pro life and pro choice
Obama & Hillary approve Long term abortion. Heartless Pigs. No Morals. No Heart! Here's a Miracle Baby.
@OFA Will always fight to protect women rights and men lives!! Women reproductive choices are theirs, only!!
@OFA @realDonaldTrump then take birth control u barbarians! Or I suppose u can murder your offspring that's what it is
@OFA I'll keep fighting to stop you and your kind from murdering the unborn! #unbornlivesmatter
It is wonderful to know someone else is fighting to defend my healthcare decision rights!!!
thanks
@OFA I will stand in solidarity for the unborn children killed by irresponsible mothers
@OFA ITS MURDER DUMFUK
More dead Americans w/out a single shot fired! Barry "mourns" the children lost to terror but celebrates this brand of murder.
Absolutely... It's a hard decision to make but some times it's necessary. Don't judge!
it's a tough choice but some times it needs to be made. Until you are able to live their lives, don't judge!
@OFA The feeling of danger is inside them!specially the genius one ruling!!!!!
your not reproducing if you're aborting
@OFA I will
Dear president Obama,Erdogan thanked you yesterday about peace with Israel.Please dont believe him, he is big unreliable liar
well said !!
@OFA we should fight for the given protect & given right to which are under the carpet timely, more choices creates automatc
in afghanistan and pakistan many women killed in dron attack first protect him
your a sick man
Women should have the right to make their own choices.  Not up to others to decide. She will make peace with her higher power
i can't put my zip code on that form?? whats the problem?
"स्त्रिदाक्षिण्य" in Hindi. Her right.
@OFA maybe we need to start thinking about what God wants oh wait separation of church and state never mind
@OFA abortion is the largest cause of death among Black Americans
yeah...every lady has her rights
@OFA Silly people. U say don't kill the child, then say we don't want to support unwed mothers w/multiple babies & babydaddies!
@OFA Yes I will!
@OFA Youre a pro-murder pos! Women apparently have more rights then men.  They can kill children legally.  Men can't do that...
@OFA 
YES YES!!
@OFA Born free live free .. this is how we learned from tiny
@OFA Am highly interested in supporting you.
@OFA what not mine is never mine! I want my life not a farmer's market of humans! Furthermore I am a human being and I need it!
it's not a choice the reproduction already happened! You want elimination of life. I thought Obama was a Christian?
Yes! A woman can choose what stays in or goes out of her body despite what others may feel about it.
@OFA Every day Mr. President!
who many abortions have you paid for
@OFA I can't sign if im from Canada.  Can't believe this is still an issue 2016 wake up !
@OFA this is a good thing. All opposing are pro birth not life.
I sure would like to know what is wrong with birth control rather than baby killing
@OFA No
@OFA 
@OFA Terri Graham
@OFA she can make her choices before repoducing and involving another life
@OFA Hillary must be getting desperate if the dems are digging up that old non issue.
Please stop the war on women. A woman should have the same rights as a man, in choices pertaining to her body.
thank you for making me proud I voted for you.
@OFA muy bien
@OFA bb
I shall support and protect the women's rights
@OFA it is my body i choose not pro life nor gov should tell you so our will not be ours... good grief people things happens
@OFA we should have the right to choose from the get go/gov. church should tell a woman what she should do with her body.
@OFA toniasmith
@OFA I will not stand for killing a child that can not defend them self you are killing the next generation.
@OFA tenaz!
don't care if it's safe. as long it becomes  a issue.
if women think the world resolve around abortion think safety
@OFA ...yellow rivers..ou Yellow stones. ..like  Rollig stones...
-yeah its called use fkn birth control or not have sex. So glad you condone murder on children . fkn muslim terrorist traitor
If @POTUS gets his way, a mom can have her 1 week old baby euthanized for convenience. @SenateGOP @SCOTUSnom @realDonaldTrump
thanks for supporting womanhood...
@OFA WOW
@OFA hgffitaroby
@OFA Why are men even responding to this tweet? Do they have a uterus? No? I didn't think so...
too bad some of these women's mom's didn't have the same choice?
@OFA  
there goes the myth about a mother's love an instinct to protect her children still no 50/50 child custody split unequal !!!!!!
#killAtWill
@OFA all except right to kill off her own offspring
Man why r you worrying so much I'll stand with millions of women just ask me I'm by their side all the time.
I'll keep fighting for a child's right to be born, thank you very much. #LetThemLive
thank you for your leadership! I will miss you!
Excuse me "Butt Wipe", but a woman's right to make her own reproductive choices are made before sex. . .  Not after.
@OFA Sir, it is no way.Reproductive choice is a criminal offence.
@OFA well get equality on everything than court child support and all other sexists laws and limitations
@OFA True.
@OFA I don't  believe in  legalized murder.
@OFA Isn't next 4th of July to celebrate USA a nation created under GOD! Was there a changed on the 10 Commandments?
with you in office, the devil doesn't need to get his hands dirty. Keep up the good work.
SCOTUS decision was appalling! Sure don't want cleaner are or access to hospital. Makes too much sense!
@OFA Do you mean woman "Humanity" has the right to kill another human being? How come?
@OFA good night from pakistan 
I think You're not talking only to theAmericanPeople cause Your advise is about woman's right I must support thanks MrPresident
@OFA I not Want  to Suffer
Can men have reproductive options too besides "Keep it in your pants." Saying that to women is misogyny.
@OFA more sodomite beliefs pushed by our president
.@BarackObama it really is childish so we'll just have too keep falling before we even think about running again. #theyouthreallyiswasted
Sir @BarackObama women have enough rights beyond that's to give #polygamy & #gaymarriage rights to women that's also #Inhuman.  @OFA
@OFA For  my  if someone  is  raped  me  I Not  Want  The  kid or  disease no
.@BarackObama why, when "the freedom of movement" is simply construed a "immigration" & those in charge of. The economy wont do their job..
We R 4 Women' rights, but not for Lumbergini to your corrupt followers
@OFA you might as well abandon all illusions of being a Christian nation what don't fit is legalised 
Thank You Mr. President..

@OFA Dr.  Will  know  is
@OFA Many problems.  If  Someone  didn't  Want  a Kid or  Canbe  born  With  a  disease. Just  protection  all of right.
