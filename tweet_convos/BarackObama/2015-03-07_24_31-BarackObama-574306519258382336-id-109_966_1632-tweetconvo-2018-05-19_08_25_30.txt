@Novirix @BarackObama bullshit white men signed it not black learn read your history book 1776year stupid
@BarackObama President Bush warned us what happen if we left Iraq early and your foolish arrogance has cost us lives and maybe millions more
@BarackObama And now it is time to become aware of the origin. (twelve yellow stars on blue ground)
@BarackObama You mention God now. ( when it's convenient ) most times its Islam ( when it's convenient ) #ConfusedPotus
@BarackObama  hi
@BarackObama I too have that faith...despite some irrational Senators (47)~!  I have faith in my country and decisions that truly serve!
@BarackObama How to faith in America while America is always and blindly against the Arabs and support Israel??!!!!
@BarackObama FAITH MUST LIE WITHIN YOUR OWN SOUL
@BarackObama Do what is right.  You feel it.  You know it.  Do it.
@BarackObama get real
@BarackObama Feline Barack Hussein Obama
Do not talk about faith
You son of villain
You are the first terrorist in the world
@BarackObama Huh,, something you lack..why r you speaking there? #NinjaCalledYouOut
@BarackObama care to support @JailbreakHQ @SVP_Ireland @AmnestyIreland since your family were at Trinity and we'ee organising it :) #JB15
@BarackObama sometimes is scary to watch all news America. Love your peers skin colour/creed etc is irrelevant. Beautiful country be proud
@BarackObama So, effective actions were not it, but faith, in the same invisible god that racists had faith in, did the trick? SMH...
@BarackObama sorry no faith in America due to countless illegal wars and its foreign policies. And its love for the murdering zionist state

@BarackObama Need that from Obama now, stop the lies, & blame all except Obama
@BarackObama at least they got more faith in God then you do you got more faith in The Islamic faith
@BarackObama we will be quoting this speech for years to come.  You remind us to look outward as well as inward
@BarackObama Amen! Now how to convince voters that their vote does count?They are covinced by ones that dont want them to. #nogerrymandering
@AndyAnderson30 Convince me my vote count and is not cancelled out by illegal double voting.
@towncartaxi Only illegal gerrymandering cancels votes. Only. @RockTheVote #VotingRightsAct
@AndyAnderson30 @RockTheVote "Only" gerrymandering cancels my vote. What a ridiculous argument. Get real
@towncartaxi @RockTheVote Research it.
@AndyAnderson30 @RockTheVote So double and multiple votes by one person does nothing? Are you a fool. Nothing to research.
@towncartaxi @RockTheVote If you believe that is even possible, you are the fool. Research #gerrymandering state by state. Maps are public.
@AndyAnderson30 @RockTheVote Gerrymandering individual  districts has been done by both parties for years Vote ID makes no difference
@BarackObama Faith in God is right. Some Americans you can never have faith in
@BarackObama @southerntalker truer believers in the dream of America than even most of the founders & framers of the country. God speed.
@BarackObama it just proves that people power and determination is the true strength of nations
