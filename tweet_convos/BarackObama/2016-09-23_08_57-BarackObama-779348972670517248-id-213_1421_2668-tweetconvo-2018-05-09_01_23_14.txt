@washingtonpost like in the 90's when scientists wanted more grant money to raise the temp that sat burn barrels to fudge tests
@washingtonpost Yep and just how far were the burn barrels sat or were they sat 100 yards from the thermometer this time too.

16 months...? Whatever you're doing is "not" working.
We're not falling for the "urgency of now" crap again.
@washingtonpost Boa tarde
"16 months in a row of undeniable, record-breaking heat."
Do we go back to calling it "global warming" now? #ActOnClimate
"16 months in a row of undeniable, record-breaking heat." perhaps it is time you admit that human beings cannot control weather
@washingtonpost  BarackObama  HVAC industry pushing CO2 systems that produce over 5x the heat released in to the aatmosphere
If we've had "16 months in a row of undeniable, record-breaking heat." it means your efforts have been ineffective.
"16 months in a row of undeniable, record-breaking heat." despite your efforts and claims of "progress. Why @ActOnClimate
one whole degree, Obama world is in trouble NY underwater, moon is falling to earth, sun is going to blowup. FAKE FAKE fake

@washingtonpost Hotter than 8 years ago? Thanks OBAMA.
@washingtonpost you could put fluoride thorium nuclear power any place you need it it's walk away safe
Caused by all your hot air
@washingtonpost with fluoride thorium nuclear power you're not wasting the land like you are with wind and solar
for sake of argument, climate change, real or not, shouldn't We take care of the Earth, I mean, its all we got.
@washingtonpost when there's no wind when there's no sun what's fluoride thorium nuclear power you still have power
moscow burrrrn!
@washingtonpost a few fluoride thorium nuclear plants would probably produce more energy then all of the solar and wind power
@washingtonpost why don't you get serious instead of complaining and use fluoride thorium nuclear power
... And your point is?
@washingtonpost lol its been the most mild summer here in my end of California
@washingtonpost yep it's like your idea of fixing it
Is wind and solar and you have no way of storing it and you waste of land
yeah maybe like by not approving any more pipe lines?  Hypocrite #NoDAPL
The true and living God controls the universe. Stop beating your head on things you can't control.
anyone living knows that's garbage and people aren't buying it. Good luck  #melbrooks @SenatorMRoberts
@washingtonpost yep keep on complaining doing little to nothing instead of using fluoride thorium nuclear power
