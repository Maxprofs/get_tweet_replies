@BarackObama I already had free preventative care and mammograms! What I didn't have was screaming high deductables and restrictions on PCPs
@BarackObama ACA will work but there are to many chefs in the kitchen.
@BarackObama free? Cost me a hundred bucks a month I can't afford...
@BarackObama I believe it is a right in USA to have health care. I suppose the alternative is a haulecaust. ;)  A bit extreme of me...
@BarackObama It's really a shame that there is such a fight for this in the USA. I know there are many good people helping people
@BarackObama It's not free! It's taxpayer funded. #ObamaLies
