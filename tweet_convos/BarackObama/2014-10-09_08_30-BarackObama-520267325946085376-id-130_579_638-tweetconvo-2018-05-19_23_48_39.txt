@WhiteHouse FACT: WalMart is dumping 30,000 employees from healthcare coverage
FACT: You are liars of epic proportion
@PragueArtist @WhiteHouse Fact - Walmart is enjoying record profits while treating employees like crap. Not the ACA's fault - just greed.
Only Big Corps have $ to influence Big Gov to their benefit. Therefore Big Gov = Big Corp domination. @ofthestardust @pragueartist
.@WhiteHouse My family continues to be deeply grateful to no longer fear losing coverage for preexisting conditions. Thank you x10000!
@WhiteHouse @ChrisMurphyCT 90% are negative yet they keep telling us people love it! Wait til Election Day!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Please,  Mr. PRESIDENT,  Please RESCHEDULE Marijuana?
@whitehouse  John 3:16
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse impressive
@WhiteHouse Because you confiscate our money if we don't. That's coercion, not effectiveness.
@WhiteHouse At the expense of people who don't use much.  Unfair.
@WhiteHouse and Republicans want total repeal of ACA

@WhiteHouse A friend just received an increase on their insurance. Three times the original amount.
@WhiteHouse#uninsured decreasing. If true, at what price?  Unfortunately, White House rhetoric requires the willing suspension of disbelief.
@WhiteHouse Yes. We are all paying dearly for your reforms. Monetarily and with our health. Working and retired.
@WhiteHouse Idulazha Mubarak U & your Famaly. Molana Umar Qasmi M.P. co-ordinator (OBC) National Commission for SC  Govt. of India
@WhiteHouse According to this same White House 25 is a child who should be covered by their parents.  More working aged adults with no jobs.
@WhiteHouse @truevisualpoet  It's a fact #ACAWorks more young Americans are insured, thanks to Affordable Care Act!
@WhiteHouse Now, these illegal immigrants that flock to ER's for free treatment purposely after hours has got to stop. Just not fair.
@WhiteHouse How many are here in the USA illegally. Separate that number, so we know the true subsidy to Americans and Illegals
@WhiteHouse Even though this may put a burden on businesses,   it is helping those locked out by the insurance industry & that's great..
@WhiteHouse I'm a single Mom who doesn't get support. The increase in premiums & deductibles have caused me HUGE financial struggles!

@WhiteHouse FACT: The # of Americans no longer participating in the workforce under @BarackObama has increased by over 23 million.
@WhiteHouse because your making their parents pay for them well into their 20's. Big Flippin accomplishment.
@bklyncook @WhiteHouse I'd rather have their parents pay for them instead of me when they go to the ER uninusred.
@WhiteHouse Bravo, President Obama for making this possible.
@WhiteHouse WRONG! All of the states which have seen a drop in the number of uninsured are states which have expanded Medicaid.
When you kill the economy and young adults can't find jobs & are forced to live at home, staying on parents plan is ONLY option  @WhiteHouse
