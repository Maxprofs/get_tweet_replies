@BarackObama why? The McDonald's peeps shouldn't get $15 bucks when they can never get my order right
@BarackObama nations also need to think out of bubble nations like China who're providing cheaper labour are actually exploiting rights.
@BarackObama @BoTruBlu Compare this to Jeb's statement. How could anyone be a Republican??!!
@BarackObama Get rid of 175,000 pages of regs and Rules costing businesses over $ 2 trillion each year to comply - lots of job there.
@MangusColorado @BarackObama #fucking dumbass worthless president!!!!
@BarackObama how about lowering taxes and abolishing obamacare tax mandate. Raising min wage will raise prices of stuff, doing no help.
@BarackObama I support my president and I think he has done wonderful things for our country.
@BarackObama Yes this video is a perfect example of why a #smallbusiness owner should have to #RaiseTheWage
@BarackObama Agree Mr. President
@BarackObama Give corporate execs a pay-cut, first. Otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time...
@BarackObama I hope that's truth .
@BarackObama I find people who work lower class and lower paying jobs tend to smoke more. Raising pay=less smoking?
@BarackObama After 2016 ilection of I miss u bro

@BarackObama and more taxes, very shrewd indeed. Still 18triil. in debt. Any other plans yet come to mind?
@BarackObama I totally agree President Obama! However, You are doing a fantastic job
@BarackObama we sure do its about time
@BarackObama Hi
@BarackObama Sure..and when all you have borrowed money from..18 trillion worth call in the debt..we are in Greece's shoes.
@BarackObama not when these people that get minimum wage don't want to work they deserve less until they actually want to work
@BarackObama we need to boost our economy, that's true, so #LegalizeMarijuana across the board and you'll boost the economy, I promise you!

@BarackObama Giving America a raise would only raise the cost of living. Cut the CEOs pay and increase the pay for the workers
@BarackObama Are you planning on cutting taxes? If so , I've got some great ideas.
@BarackObama thetsgood

@BarackObama Great, then the dollar  menu at Macdonalds becomes the 3 dollar menu hurting the same people you say you're helping!
@BarackObama I agree. If the government can give "Themselves" a raise,"Then"..."Why" can't we who work hard get one?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama tell them also how boosting wage also boosts inflation. Also why not foster empowerment and say get SKILLS for wage hike!
@BarackObama and drop the value of the American dollar to theoretically dissolve the middle class? I don't think so.
@BarackObama not minimum wage but also a house rent
@BarackObama aight well then you better boost my wage,cuz i swear if a fucking bag boy makes more than me I'll snap
@BarackObama No not a raise, give us a tax break.
@BarackObama no people need to work for there money,no one  should start off making anymore than $9 a hour
@BarackObama Because flipping burgers & making tacos takes a skilled savant
“@BarackObama: "We need to boost the minimum wage. Give America a raise." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage” ty bc i need more $ to go shopping
@BarackObama sir what is the minimum wage right now?
@MartinOMalley is ready to do that “@BarackObama: "We need to boost the minimum wage. Give America a raise." —President Obama #RaiseTheWage”
@BarackObama Obamacare and now this. You talk about jobs out of 1 side of your mouth, then you knock businesses down.  #OBAMAtheSOCIALIST
@BarackObama NEW MEXICO NEEDS IT. THANK YOU

.@BarackObama Where do businesses get the money to pay those wages?
@BarackObama please no I fear inflation 󾠵
@BarackObama do you speak for companies barely above water ?
@BarackObama We certainly do. But consider how business will pay for it before you leap. Don't kill the golden geese; they ARE the workers.
@BarackObama also the reason why it takes years to fix a few mile stretch of road in PA. #takealap
@BarackObama what America needs is a plague to weed out the weak
@BarackObama won't do any good it'll raise prices
@BarackObama nah
@BarackObama thanks Obama
@BarackObama We need to decrease the price of consumer goods, prices have risen but jobs have decreased. It becomes a viscous cycle.
@BarackObama #educate #america #congress #reschedule #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis #cbd

@BarackObama Very well put, Mr. President, accurate plan in the pipeline. I am positively sure you will implement these issues.
@BarackObama You need to repeal that offensive same-sex Act too
@BarackObama okay then why stop at $10/hr? If it's as easy as all that why not $20? $50? $100?
@BarackObama I think my cell frequency is being intercepted so I never get called in for an interview.
@BarackObama nigga please..... You're causing inflation, it may sounds good to everyones ears, but its not worth it. Everything is going up$
@BarackObama ai eu já discordei um pouco
