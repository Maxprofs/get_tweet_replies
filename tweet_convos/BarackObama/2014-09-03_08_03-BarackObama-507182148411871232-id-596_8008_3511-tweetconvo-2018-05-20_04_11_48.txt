#FACT: No 1 gonna reduce/forgive ur #studentdebt. Its a #democrat #lie designed 2 sway votes. R u #stupid? #tcot @BarackObama @eric_sitton
@Truthseer1961 @BarackObama Keep regurgitating your cynical right wing narratives based in non-fact & bias. It suits you well.
@eric_sitton U sayin #KingObama & th #democrats r gonna #delete everyone's student #debt ifen ya vote 4 em? #LOL I missed u man! #tcot #DUH
@Truthseer1961 Wow, not only did I or anyone else not say that but congrats on building a strawman big enough to host a burning man festival
@eric_sitton But #KingObama & the #democrats r implying that. Its what they want people 2 think they're gonna do. #StudentDebt relief? Bait.
@Truthseer1961 No actually. They're implying that comprehensive federal student loan REFORM is possible, but not if congress doesn't act.
@eric_sitton Most voters r not as informed. They use vague terms. #assistance #relief etc 2 imply more than they will really give. #tcot
@Truthseer1961 Thats different from railing against the effort entirely + Its more about making higher edu more affordable 4 future students
@BarackObama follow me i love America
