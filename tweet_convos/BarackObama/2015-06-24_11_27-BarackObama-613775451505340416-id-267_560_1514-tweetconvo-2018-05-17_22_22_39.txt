@sebroche @BarackObama Obamacare is medicaid. If you qualify it pays 80% of your medical bills. it doesn't pay for an ambulance.
@rjladya @sebroche Obamacare is not Medicaid or any insurance, it's a set of laws. That's it.
@hotandhumid @sebroche then you've never applied for Obama care. Try  8665504355. That is the east coast number before the deadline ranout.
@rjladya @sebroche Yes, my DH got his thru there. It's NOT insurance. It's the Affordable Care Act, laws changing how insurers work.
@hotandhumid @sebroche yes but if you called before the deadline you qualified fir welfare. Now it's a free for all with insurance companies
@rjladya @sebroche No, you must meet income guidelines. In TX if you get >$300/mth you don't qualify. The regular insurance is not free.
@hotandhumid @sebroche right in pa you have to make 1900 or less year to qualify if you have a dependent.
@rjladya @sebroche Yes and if you make more you get regular insurance which you PAY for.
@BarackObama great job love my POTUS he rocks

@BarackObama I totally agree- thank you for being a forth right visionary and leader
@graemenrodgers @EF517_V2 @BarackObama The 'last 12 months' is the time period surveyed. (Part of the question asked)
@graemenrodgers @EF517_V2 @BarackObama Census asks the same question(s) every survey period.
@graemenrodgers American generosity is unmatched in human history. What's sad is that so many are on the dole.  @EF517_V2 @BarackObama

@BarackObama if you think your premiums are high with ACA, image the old plans when you encounter a major health problem
@BarackObama the problem isn't those who can afford healthcare the problem is those who refuse to get it

@BarackObama that is a real blessing mr.president, thanks to you my dear!
@BarackObama That is because you have to pay way more just so you can use insurance, monthly cost plus pay deductible first up to $10,000
@BarackObama shieeeeet
