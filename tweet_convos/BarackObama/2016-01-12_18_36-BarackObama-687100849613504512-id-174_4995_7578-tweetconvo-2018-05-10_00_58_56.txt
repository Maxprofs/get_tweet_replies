@BarackObama @Greeenguy111 These are important informational points that should be expounded on to the extreme, to counteract misinformation
@BarackObama Hi
@BarackObama then why not one go to jail? Food stamps frauders go to jail...
@BarackObama #fanniegate and #Freddie did #USgovernment
@BarackObama Yes this is true. One of few things I agree with you on. Wall street greed caused financial crisis.
@BarackObama people wanna continue to try to oppress the poor and needy. Smh
@BarackObama @liberwattr I am going to miss him (a lot of people will).
@BarackObama I personally feel that you have done all you can do as President. We should give you credit for what has been accomplished
@BarackObama @Vonton_Soup he ain't giving out no food stamps 
@BarackObama stamp. They want to be like my mother who has food stamp & guess what's her PIN# 0911, want to do 9/11 here? It's your last
@BarackObama #job well done thank you
@BarackObama @emily_stousland indeed, no increase in wages, Walmart biggest recipient, they get rebates, that's insane. Raise the wages!!
@BarackObama I believe the Clinton's had a huge hand in it. The Community Reinvestment Act.
@BarackObama who made their money from people on food stamps, obama care is the food stamps of the insurance world
@BarackObama 
No recklessness in government and wall street which was allowed because of countries failure to obey GODS LAWS
@BarackObama la g sZ3w53

@BarackObama the housing crisis caused by Dems policies was a large part of this

@BarackObama Tell em Prez! Folks love to blame you for this country falling apart, I guess they slept through the whole Bush administration
@BarackObama Republicans can't handle that bit of truth!
@BarackObama bravo
@BarackObama Now that you passed that buck, will you please fix this ––> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAoXgZLRee0 …
@BarackObama letter. Daily briefing, face to face at Anderson!
@BarackObama & reasonable. Get Anderson Air Force Base & I'll clean up this plc. quickly, you ain't backing down, are you! You read my
@BarackObama actions. History, tells you that that works, bec one rebuilds, new fresh blood is in power, perhaps less corrupt, more balance
@BarackObama months of your term bec there are those who can do whatever they want w/o taking into consideration the consequences of their
@BarackObama the Wall St big wigs than those ordinary Main Streeters. You can tear 'em apart, can't you not?! Have some fun for the remainin
@BarackObama themselves to move up. Sure, the recklessness on Wall St caused the financial crisis & the QE that you did greatly benefitted
@BarackObama must be reformed as well as insurance practices, & many others to ensure there is equality for those who are trying to apply
@BarackObama my condo there was no mortgage, but their failure to enforce the by laws caused much greater prblms. Banking sys on the island
@BarackObama that you please get any un paid common area fr GU's share of WIC, foodstamps, sect8, Medicaid in all fairness. When I bought
@BarackObama for sect 8 housing. I don't have a ticket to food stamps & sect8 & they're attempting to possess my condo, so I may request
@BarackObama er reason why high teenage pregnancy occurs so that one can use the child as a ticket to augment for benefits and/or to qualify
@BarackObama then can they apply themselves to their fullest potential if they know that they can always depend on food stamps. That's anoth
@BarackObama that there is much needed reform in this area, esp when over 90% of public sch students are on one form of entitlements, how
@BarackObama they poor & chronic food stampas eaters & worst they do wrong sometimes to good citizens like me. Am sure you can only agree
@BarackObama can they move up? Granted that they did not cause the financial target, but they are so easy to frame & wrongfully accuse bec
@BarackObama ble skills. Can't you a food stamps recipient, sect 8 has air condition 24/7, stay home, use to fleece compact-impact. So how
@BarackObama 2 or 3 generations & employers use that as an excuse to hire fr overseas bec apparently those on food stamps have no demonstra
@BarackObama Here on the island of GU, @ times they're emboldened to do wrong & thought that's an American dream. There are those in it for
@BarackObama But there should be a reform or change bec there are those enslaved by food stamps and it is used to ctrl ppl to some extent.
@BarackObama @jake_haley I'd argue that government policy was to blame.
@Jack_son_tailor @BarackObama I'd definitely agree there.
@BarackObama Preach
@BarackObama I would have to see the numbers to verify that statement.
@BarackObama yea they did. They are taking a toll on the system. Create some real jobs douche bag.
Which party warned of crisis & tried to prevent?
Which party claimed no safety & soundness issues?
