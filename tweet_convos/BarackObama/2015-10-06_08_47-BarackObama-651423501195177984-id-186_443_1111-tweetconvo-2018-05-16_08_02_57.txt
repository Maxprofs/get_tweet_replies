@BarackObama sounds good
@BarackObama this is uncomfortable for people with disability to have their babies taken away for no reason
@BarackObama When you were elected you promised no corporate ties. This is the worst - NAFTA on Steroids.  You betrayed us.
@BarackObama Why is the actual TPP hidden from the public? What don't you want us to see?
@BarackObama Agree, but we still need more jobs in America and better paying jobs as well as. Training programs.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Then why are you cloaking it in secrecy? Where's you commitment to transparency?
@BarackObama El mejor presidente
@BarackObama the more US goods sold abroad the richer multinationals become.higher-paying jobs is a utopy everywhere...let's hope I'm wrong!
@BarackObama yes it is.can our country meet even a half of it?
@BarackObama and the more screwed over the rest of us become
@BarackObama:let the good work start with all President and vice world wide.
@BarackObama good
@BarackObama Let us think4 all who contribute in world prosperity without worrying4 single country being a one great leader hav broad ideas
@BarackObama good job, Mr. President!
@BarackObama needed a laugh.... Exactly why this country is running so smooth barracks aid?!? #outoftouch #15moremonths
@BarackObama So misleading! Provisions still secret except to your corporate cronies & funders. Judas
@BarackObama it's brilliant!!

Easy to explain the #TPP 

It's 2 combat the #BRICS from gaining world market share against the U.S. dollar
@BarackObama is Obama going to get Trump to fix it for him?
@BarackObama  The great Traitor. You do nothing while Putin attacks the Rebels whom we support, You wrecked our Country = Traitor!
@BarackObama ..create more get more..
@BarackObama Then why are so many jobs going to Mexico and China???? We're not exporting anything.You're a liar.
@BarackObama what about foreign goods sold here.  GATT, NAFTA and your new deal are destroying the country.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama we need such growth in Africa too; more investments towards social developments
@BarackObama Did you look out of the windows of the Whitehouse Sun and see the thousands of people who lost children with prescriptions?
@BarackObama check ur dm bro
@BarackObama ...So where are all the great jobs created by the present trade agreements??
@BarackObama it's more about us opening factories and exploring labor abroad, you fail to mention, Mr Obama. :'(
@BarackObama true. But maybe people in other countries have a different way to think about it? #selfish
@BarackObama #FeelTheBern
@BarackObama. Need more regulations of those who wrote the TPP. Otherwise American jobs will fly to China and their profits to the Caymans.
@BarackObama Ok
@BarackObama  
Yes!!
@BarackObama thats jobs for them, WHAT ABOUT US!!
@BarackObama Mr. President, I look up to you, but I feel that this is a mistake. We shouldn't let corporations run rampant w/o regulation
@BarackObama Shipping from the US to Kenya for example is way too expensive compared to China. Re-think direct flights to US from Africa.
@BarackObama More good American jobs lost while Big Business profits. No TPP.
@BarackObama yeah that's what you want the world to think. But what is really going on?
@BarackObama  The TPP is a scam. How will the economy expand with a workforce of automated robots? that's what's happening now!
@BarackObama what about student loans
@BarackObama But, can u explain to us what is so good abt this deal? Since its been mired in secrecy, we know nothing of its terms.

@BarackObama IF OBAMA SAYS THIS TPP AGREEMENT IS GOOD, YOU KNOW IT`S BAD FOR THE U.S. HE HASN`T MADE RIGHT CALL YET.
@BarackObama true but free trade allows big business to set up inverse Corp HQ's for taxes & they can set up shop for cheapest slave labor

@BarackObama Just watch out for inflation. Global networks are more healthy when connected in a diverse fashion. Science transcends nation.
@BarackObama if companies are allowed to just up and walk out of the country, how does that create jobs?
@BarackObama i think it is good idea but it also havesome siadvantage but it is good one carry you
@BarackObama for sure.. I agree .
@BarackObama And yet it never works out this way...
@BarackObama Only trouble is we don't sell more goods abroad. They dump excess goods on our markets causing lower wages and loss of jobs.
@BarackObama TTP we know what your doing and why your doing it hmu if you need help
@BarackObama Thanks President Obama we need more jobs 2

@BarackObama How i wish that my County will have a president like you.
@BarackObama <3 <3 <3
@BarackObama Mr President , Fords made in China do not help US workers. Great for Ford but not much for us. Are we giving house away again?
@BarackObama That's not what this deal actually is about. The Republicans were TOO eager to sign on just like NAFTA.
@BarackObama transpacifi partnership is only restricted to job/goods sector. abt refuge crises.? Reportdly US allowed 50 out of 1.5 refugees
@BarackObama

@BarackObama by sale & supplying weapons who gains who loses needs to be elaborated to world as well
@BarackObama In theory, you'd think this works but it doesn't. Keep jobs in America and keep people working.
@BarackObama salut monsieur le Président, je ne sais si je peux devenir votre ami dans ce site?
@BarackObama the more jobs we loose to overseas relocation the less money we have TRUMP 2016
@BarackObama  اه ماشي ..قديش كيلو البندورة عندكو

@BarackObama the excuse of higher exports has been used for Nafta and Cafta and not born out in the data, Mr. President

@BarackObama  That b a good if the corps shared their increase in Profits with their workers
@BarackObama Why are you trying to push us into supporting something we haven't even got a chance to read yet?
@BarackObama Don't ruin your presidency by pushing the TPP. It does nothing to create jobs for Americans.
@BarackObama But it never works out for the Anerican people, only the wealthy.
@BarackObama thats IT.
@BarackObama 没翻译吗⊙﹏⊙
@BarackObama TPP exploits and deprives the majority to benefit an asset-owning super-rich minority. #AbolishCapitalism
@BarackObama Lie! If you sell your good abroad other countries have to be able to afford them.Lose high wage jobs and create low wage jobs.
@barackobama lol
@BarackObama the only ones agreeing are the terrorist Muslims
@BarackObama TPP sounds like you are just trying to expand the global dictatorship of capital and undermine national sovereignty.
@BarackObama Stop importing from slave labour countries you numpty !! Choose Government as you would a Jury. Dump career Politicians.
@BarackObama O Dólar tá muito alto ;-;
@BarackObama That's a lovely concept, but could we maybe do it in a way that doesn't allow for corporate censorship of the Internet?
@Jezi_Belle @BarackObama or in such a way that corporations can sue for laws that effect their profits (I.e. labor laws)
@BarackObama @ArianaGrande http://www.ketto.org/capturethepast  please support my campaign! And save the dying forms of folk arts in India!
@BarackObama We have heard this before and American salaries have gone in only one direction so far, and that is downwards. We say no to TPP
