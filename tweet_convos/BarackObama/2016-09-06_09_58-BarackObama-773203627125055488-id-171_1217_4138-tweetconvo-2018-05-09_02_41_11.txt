People suffering abuse&violation of human,sovereign&constitutional rights to protect WATER in N.Dakota..WHERE R U? WHY SILENCE?
how many people has climate change killed this year? I'm sorry I feel there are more pressing matters at hand right now.
@NPR # go to North Dakota
all my energy cames from this view..
way to go!
The Missouri River is a beautiful site too. But it won't be when that pipeline leaks
what about the conservation of rivers that run through this country. #NoDAPL
thank you by blood of jesus christ healing andsalvation and delievance of our sins and protection  to staff of own televison
Can you help Flint, MI please?
@NPR Very true

congratulations on the Chicago Cubs win!!
I'm from china, do you like me,no ,I not love you!
@NPR 
Dear Obama do u have time ? I need talk to you about important thing in us so plz if you have time billing me.
@NPR good job
@NPR To stop phony climate change, loud mouth politicians should stop flying around one private jets! And confiscating money!
Protecting our environment is not a conservative or progressive issue, it is a basic American value.
Tell the @TheDemocrats to remove #fracking from the national platform.
@NPR 
Counting the days till your sorry ass is gone...
@NPR 
If only you were there to stop the ice age!
If CIA and FBI HQs were attacked by helicopters and agents were killed #WhatWouldYouDo? TR
where is the protection for the Sioux Reservation being bulldozed right now?  Ancient burial grounds have been butchered.
@ClimateGuy1973 @Julia_Isabel84 @rileytess

@NPR 保护地球人人有责！
So, where is the budget for conservation? How about that U.S. 1.7BILLION money transfer to Iran AFTER the $400MIL for ransom ?
Empty words in light of pipeline construction
My home town, son!
no such thing.
LT is gorgeous. I remember many Summer's their. Fallen Leaf!!!
Yep!
That is where
one of my #art teacher
Ning Yeh
lives
@NPR help save the Willamette National Forest!  Reagan slashed the budget.
@NPR Then why aren't you talking about the Dakota Pipeline?
@NPR 
maybe some more thought toward 'zika' spraying that's killing all insects incl all bees.
best story on conservation is Yokohama bay, Japan starting in the 60's. Not shutting down industry (lead smelters).
I know that in the future historians will be very kind to POTUS Obama unlike the racist Republican Party.
I sure WISH you would QUIT with all this BULLSHIT! Once a BULLSHITTER always a BULLSHITTER!!!!!!!!!!
As me an environmental scientist climate change is every way and according to Darwin natural selection will favor the fittest
@NPR 

Hi
Thank you, Mr. President for your good deeds.  They don't go unnoticed.

co readings are the same now as they were in the year 1920.
@NPR was this pic taken from your boat while polluting the air? Or maybe your private jet blowing fumes all over?? #greenmyass
@NPR Absolutely

@NPR reducing greed in the name human development will automatically have climate that's doesn't change insanely
"No child shld ever die fr hunger, or a mosquito bite, or the poison of dirty water. This is the justice we seek in the world."
We should all stand up for the environment.
@Kris_Sacrebleu If you haben't, you REALLY need to check the #NoDAPL hashtag. It involves ALL of this
so is #SacredStoneCamp check into it #NoDAPL
@NPR it limits use by humans. You continue to.take more and more of our freedom
muy acertado como siempre mi Obama. Lastima que ya nadie te pela, pero yo te voy a dar retweet

@NPR BO! This is The Lords World! It will NEVER be destroyed! Soon gonna be New!

please take down the 4 Snake River Dams or the Southern Resident Killer Whales will starve to death!! PLEASE. It's URGENT
The liar in chief is clueless. The science doesn't support your narrative. It's nothing but a hoax
it's called following the wrong direction 
Aka. Footsteps,  barking tree, etc 
No go 4 retirement in millennium
@NPR
than why are you letting them put that pipe line at standing rock? Again braking a treaty with American Indians. Horrible!
strange isn't it? Liberals embrace conservation, conservatives embrace waste and destruction of the earth....
@NPR Selamlar REİS
Please #NoDAPL put your money where your mouth is; actions towards progress speaks volumes louder than vague promises. Ok?
@NPR Selamlar REİS
@NPR Please we need internacional help! #StopCoupInBrazil
@NPR thats great man, you should go shut down DAPL. Seriously, take your jet over there right now. You would be a hero.

salut le premier président le plus doué !
Lake Tahoe is the "should have been" National Park. Glad other places were set aside for all of US.
@NPR 
Conservation works when people have access to protected area do they gain respect & empathy.
