@BarackObama its stupid to.argue about.something that is inevitably going to be repealed. Make free education your mission until you.leave.
You mean the millions getting it for free?!RT@BarackObama -"The Republican budget would strip health insurance for millions of Americans."
@BarackObama Translation, this budget could grow the economy and produce benefits for hundreds of millions of Americans
@BarackObama everyone deserves health insurance but the middle class cant keep paying for problems we are sinking. Jobs are going overseas
@BarackObama yeah but ACA has caused 90 hospitals to.close and over 200 announced they likely will follow. ACA failed and will be repealed.

@BarackObama Well can Americans strip their health insurance from them? GOP give us what we give you. We pay it's not free for us.
“@BarackObama: "The Republican budget would strip health insurance for millions of Americans." —President Obama”

Either them or SCOTUS.
