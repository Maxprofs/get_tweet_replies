@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  fact: there were WMD'S in Iraq.  That's how your boys in ISIS got them. Wrong again.  You are a traitor
@ronin7us @WhiteHouse @BarackObama Well why didn't we find any then?
@steve_sawyervt @WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Good question.  ISIS found the WMD'S in Mosul.  Both chemical weapons and radioactive material
@ronin7us @WhiteHouse @BarackObama would that be the terrorist group that formed after the bush imposed departure from Iraq?
@steve_sawyervt @WhiteHouse @BarackObama  trained them in Jordan. Under CIA directions.  Under orders from Obama
@ronin7us @WhiteHouse @BarackObama interesting perspective
@steve_sawyervt @WhiteHouse @BarackObama the truth is ALWAYS more interesting than listening to Obama's lies
@ronin7us @WhiteHouse @BarackObama more interesting than Bush/Cheney lies? They got 8,000 people killed
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama . If he was wrong, how did Sadam kill a million Kurds. I don't think it was with love.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama, you have weakened our country and done a terrible job. We believed in you and you disappointed us.
@dguajardo @WhiteHouse @BarackObama Rather go to war in Iran? That's the alternative.
@warcrimesbush @WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes wake up
@warcrimesbush @WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes it's going to happen. If you want to be scared and wait for the war to come to us?
@WhiteHouse @LindaCollins11 Can't believe that!
@WhiteHouse so this means it's ok to make a deal with Iran?? LOL we can't trust them.
@SterleneMarie @WhiteHouse Not about trust it's to avoid another stupid war.
@warcrimesbush @WhiteHouse glad to know you trust terrorists.  You probably trust North Korea.
@WhiteHouse @drhug Dear WH. Why not prosecute Cheney for war crimes.?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ok for barakobama
@WhiteHouse Don't you have the votes to pass the deal. Why now demonize people who disagree. This is beneath the dignity of the office.
@EzraDrissman @WhiteHouse ummm....try to keep up..the #IranDeal WILL pass. #POTUS has enough votes to sustain then veto. Try again, please
@whovian15 @WhiteHouse That was my point.
@EzraDrissman @WhiteHouse it's not demonizing, it's that Dick Cheney was very wrong? So the White House is not allowed to tell the truth?
@whovian15 @WhiteHouse If they were still vying for votes. It just seems slightly petty. Kind of sick of petty politicians.
@EzraDrissman @WhiteHouse this man has been wrong on nearly EVERYTHING  he has no regrets about sending soldiers to their deaths
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama https://www.facebook.com/arkcheri/videos/1141056512576025/?hc_location=ufi … #SaveSamFisher  help these persecuted Christians or do you care?  Real name Syed help him..

@warcrimesbush @WhiteHouse you're crazy if you believe we're not involved in M.E. Healthcare is still a joke. Gay marriage wasnt a priority
