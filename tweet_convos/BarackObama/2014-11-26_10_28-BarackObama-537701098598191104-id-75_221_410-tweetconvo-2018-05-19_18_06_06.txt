@EnvAm @BarackObama O'Dumbass isn't qualified to change his own underwear; much less to talk or take action on Climate Issues.
@LaffenLarry @EnvAm @BarackObama At least he's qualified to not be a jackass on Twitter.
@snaazzysauce @EnvAm @BarackObama I see you have an opinion - I suppose I'll take the high road and let you have it. Unlike you.

@snaazzysauce I'm sorry to see you have such a delicate constitution. Perhaps you shouldn'd be using Twitter.
