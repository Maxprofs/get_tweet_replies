@BarackObama how is that when you have to pay 600 a month for  health ins? Do explain?
@yesisaidit4u @BarackObama that's only cause your state won't play ball and wants to oppress you. I pay 100/ a month for me, wife and child
@DaddioJoe @BarackObama really? Wow. Obama care?
@yesisaidit4u @BarackObama yeah. I live in CA. Other states that refuse to adopt it are fucking their citizens over and blaming Obama. Sad.
@DaddioJoe @BarackObama I don't get Obama care because I work and my employer offers it.
@BarackObama How about: no one in America should experience poverty. Period.
@aliveoccupation explain how that one will work
@URinOilKountry The nuts and bolts are easy. You'd get a check just like social security. Except for everyone. And no deduction if you work.
@aliveoccupation where is the money coming from if working Americans pay no deductions
@URinOilKountry I don't know. But Blankfein, Dimon, etc have unlimited govt charge accts and no one ever asks where that money comes from!
@aliveoccupation money for nothing is hardly a solution. Those cheques you speak of need to be funded by taxation.
@URinOilKountry Money for nothing is exactly what banks get from the Fed everyday. Why would the sky fall if we gave it to people instead?
@URinOilKountry In fact, giving money directly to the people (rather than banks) was even within the Fed's legal mandate UNTIL Dodd-Frank!

@BarackObama 
First world should be the first not a joke
@BarackObama What about the companies that don't even give people full time because of that reason? -.- it's not helping.
@BarackObama I worked three jobs at once, at times and still was in poverty.  I was a nurse for twenty seven years.  Now below poverty.
@BarackObama @Peacepox That statement epitomizes the liberal philosophy. Conservatives despise the statement and those needing help. #p2
@BarackObama well said..so WHY are there 6,900 homeless in your home state living with BEDBUGS?

@BarackObama then why are all of you destroying what our forefathers and our fore bearers created for us?
@BarackObama it's not an equal playing field if you think it is, what part of your pension will YOU donate to those in need? want it-earn it
@BarackObama Would, should, could. Life isn't fair and it can't be legislated into being so.
@BarackObama :)
@BarackObama @maritzasolito #RT I am with him! #FixTheHouse so he can help us!!!!!

@BarackObama .........Thank you
@BarackObama and what about the rest of the world Mr Pt!
@BarackObama my dear sir,fllow me please
@BarackObama It's very correct. American people know how to run a family economically what I think.
@BarackObama The simple truth is.. #People in #Poverty Cannot Afford To Be #Poor...
@BarackObama "This is the work that God wants from you, to believe in the one he has sent.."
@BarackObama @Nutzwert They say the same in Germany and look what happens - a national poverty emergency
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama well done, long life and prosperity
@BarackObama good
@BarackObama why did you sign that climate change bill

@BarackObama You are not supposed to raise a family on minimum wage numbnuts.  Get a decent job BEFORE you have a family!
@BarackObama PRESIDENTE POR FAVOR NÃO M PODEMOS ABANDONAR OS QUE ESTÃO SENDO CRUCIFICADOS
@BarackObama well if that “full time” contains “low skills” and “little motivation”, then…
@BarackObama Then why do you allow foreign trade agreements to continue like NAFTA & TPP, that have & will send millions of jobs over seas?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama 我就想知道什么时候签证能好签些……我还准备去看黄石公园和加州呢
@BarackObama agree however very sad about your policy re. isis and russia
@BarackObama
@BarackObama A government that spends over 500 billion dollars a year on defense should NEVER have people live in poverty.
@BarackObama GREAT WORDS WHERES THE PLAN!!!!!
@BarackObama It is you, Obama, that has created poverty.  We were doing just fine until you became president.  What a mistake that was!
@BarackObama @pinkbunny70 Amen to that!  #CongressBBoldAndCourageousNow
We will punish you in Nov if you don't.
@BarackObama Guess what....  Businesses now only give people 8-15 hrs a week thanks to YOU'RE changes & their greed.  People are suffering.
Hope soon in India! "@BarackObama: "no one who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty." http://ofa.bo/i0mY "
@BarackObama I love ur speech
@BarackObama I would say: in the whole world.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama So, did America also have poverty?
@BarackObama then back off the economy and let the free market rule. U have no idea what you are doing. It's time for you to quit. Take joe2
@BarackObama  yep it's really awful when someone my age have to live off  seven hundred dollars a month on social security
@BarackObama

@BarackObama you should hmu with a follow
“@BarackObama: "In America, no one who works full-time should ever have to raise a family in poverty."  http://ofa.bo/i0mY ”
@BarackObama Poverty actually makes some people physically and mentally ill. It's so stressful. There's no relief for the working poor.
@BarackObama Then help them improve skills/education for a higher wage rather than forcing sm. businesses to fire people due to wage hike
@BarackObama Its the type of life that makes you resent the world. Its hard to be successful when you grow up the hard way. Trust me.
@BarackObama that's a disgrace and a mock of humanity. Everyone should be able to survive on a full-time salary. We live to live.
@BarackObama your doing agood job
@BarackObama yes true. To raise a family with a mortgage you need to earn 150,000 a year.
@BarackObama What about state owned oil ? We should be making billions on oil for the American people. Enough to pay for Social Security
@BarackObama Radical change is needed - more per hr doesn't help when basics cost so much. You raise the rate they'll raise the rent & heat.
@BarackObama The working class has excellent uses for money...It invests directly in human life...food, clothing, shelter, and recreation
@BarackObama you got nothing lies coming from your mouth go sale that shit somewhere else!!!!
@BarackObama  well then stop taxing and regulating the shit out of them!!!
@BarackObama then why is the cost of goods going up? Stop with the politics already!!
@BarackObama but plenty are.
