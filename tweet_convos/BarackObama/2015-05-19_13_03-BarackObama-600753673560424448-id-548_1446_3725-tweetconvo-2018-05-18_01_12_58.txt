@BarackObama yes obamacare is here to break Americans not help. My monthly payments for health went from $0.00 to about $650.00 how is this?
@a2d9ddb7041a4ba @BarackObama It just means you chose your health plan unwisely.
@loriar7346 @BarackObama it was a company benefit paid for. After the new laws they couldnt offer it. Do you have no idea what you are sayin
@a2d9ddb7041a4ba @BarackObama If they cdn't offer it, was poor coverage. If was gd coverage, ur employer lied to get out of it. Logic.
@loriar7346 @BarackObama how.di you know? How many businesses do you own? #Liberalsaredumb
@a2d9ddb7041a4ba @BarackObama What I know frm experience is the plans r good, & some emplyrs r against it on princpl so make up lies abt it.
@loriar7346 we know all the upper management they aren't lying, but nice try. My brother owns his iwn business too and its messed them up 2!
@JPrikasky @BarackObama That's nonsense. If you chose a plan with a high deductible that's your own fault. #thanksobamacare
@JPrikasky @BarackObama $123 a month is not expensive. Get a grip.
@BarackObama if it's so important pay for it your damn self! Sick of paying for leeches!!

@BarackObama Good Job Mr. President , Gracias desde republica dominicana
@BarackObama  You should with hold federal funding when these states don't comply with federal programs like affordable health care.
@BarackObama really????? I can't find a primary care doctor to save my life!!!  The ACA has driven them into retirement!

“@BarackObama: This is why health care reform matters :Free?) Tax payer? . ”
@BarackObama nice job!
@BarackObama Good job Mr. President. You have secured a true legacy that will inspire many generations to come.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama thank you for keeping Americans healthy!
@BarackObama My son + friends are musicians. When they come to Philly, they stay with me. They love the ACA! They can tour with less worry.
@BarackObama It's NOT free. MY tax dollars are paying for it for people who won't work.
@BarackObama nothing in this world is free someone pays for it and its us, the hard working american tax payers.
@Magicmatt1004 @BarackObama hurts literally everybody within that society, even those "hardworking taxpaying muricans" youre jingo-ing about
“@BarackObama: This is why health care reform matters. ”
OBAMACARE
@BarackObama an unconstitutional fee to charge American citizens a tax penalty to put money in the pockets of bankers. This isn't freedom
@BarackObama I am so proud of you that you stuck up for all of us because how ludicrous is it to deny Americans basic healthcare?!
@BarackObama President Barack Obama Thank You meeting the needs of our daily lives struggling day by day
@BarackObama donne moi un visa pour moi un belle homme nord afriquain or a little job please
@BarackObama
@BarackObama that is great
@BarackObama and the cost of mine has skyrocketed. Thanks for letting us subsidize the uninsured.
@BarackObama congrats,finally
@BarackObama Now tell us of the 31 million that's are under insured.
@BarackObama no there not, everyone I know has health care cut and cannot afford co pays or prescriptions, what kind of drugs are you on!!
@BarackObama Sir, you're simply the best! GOD bless you and your beautiful family It's been a honor to have you as my President.
@BarackObama your health care system is a joke
@BarackObama always forgetting about the middle class
@BarackObama This is why getting Obama and his constant lies out of office matters.
@BarackObama No wonder the norm ofpeople R paying high premiums, we have 2
make up the slack for those YOU said can have free care! WRONG!!!
@BarackObama  I been learning about Cuba
@BarackObama This is why Obama needing to get fired asap matters even more. The left wing coon is a political castastrophe
“@BarackObama: This is why health care reform matters. ”
@BarackObama  I think that this is a way to control us and make us spend more of our money on something some of us don't want or need.
@barackobama health care has failed to save people from pollution,  food adulteration,  obesity & degenerative diseases
@BarackObama I want it repealed and gone forever! It has made more lives miserable than even you hoped would happen
@BarackObama but who's paying for it?
@BarackObama still struggling with medical bills here in Idaho.
@BarackObama 
Dear sir mr BarakObama
as a humanpen I need your help..
@BarackObama Yes. Thank you Mr. Obama. I, and millions of others thank you too!

@BarackObama who pays?
@BarackObama #educate #america #MedicalMarijuana #medicalcannabis
@BarackObama thanks to some of us being forced to psy the way for others that can't or worse won't!
@BarackObama I'M ONE OF THEM #ThanksObamacare

@BarackObama so a question, at my job we are all limited to be part time to avert providing health care, does this sound like it is working?
@BarackObama 安倍首相がポツダム宣言の内容を知らないと国会で答弁しました。米国大統領としての、旧連合国の主軸である米国の見解を発表願いたい。
This, from @BarackObama



This means that the richest country in the world takes care of less than 50% of its people
@BarackObama True wealth is health. People need to realise that true health reform starts in the home. Stand up and take action!

@BarackObama nothing's free. Someone's paying for it. That's false advertising.
@BarackObama good morning Really u r so much worried for all world health care
@BarackObama i do agree with u.long live to Obama. Health as now is not human. care reform matters.
@BarackObama thank you from our family ,for the health care that saved my daughter
@BarackObama Unless you have a health insurance that is grandfathered in and they don't follow this... Just got screwed over $1,000 for BC!
@BarackObama best place to start health care reform would be dissolving the doughnut hole that forces seniors into bankruptcy.
@BarackObama nice thought
