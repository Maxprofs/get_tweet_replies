I think this is one of the few quotes you've made I agree with. Each parent should care about their youngs future
HE WAS THE FORTY-FOURTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA EVERYONE
..how do we stop trump from destroying the earth? How do we deal with the ignorance he has for the environment. It's not fair
certainly not from a Muslim, global population dominated world led by satanists
That is why we voted Trump & not Clinton!!

@WhiteHouse I care @POTUS
Then why don't you care about the world you are passing on. You have spent more money than all presidents combined #false Pres

@WhiteHouse says the guy who passed on trillions in debt to the same grandchildren
@WhiteHouse jai Meher baba Obama jee. This is called God's shadow illusion. NO RESPECT FOR PARENTS BUT LOVE CHILD/GR CHILDREN.
@WhiteHouse  @Number10gov   who cares about these kids ? NO ONE, government's around the world be ashamed
So WHY have you FUCKED up this country for the LAST * YEARS!
@WhiteHouse if you really cared about kids Mr. Obama, you would have not run up your federal debt.
then why did you leave them with the largest debt ever?
@WhiteHouse as long as Killary does what she says she going to do???
@WhiteHouse Apparently Obama didn't care enough!! Passing on a shithole of a presidency he has held! Disgustingly disgraceful!!
@WhiteHouse We're not inspired by politicians that earn money by selling influence. Clinton Foundation?
/ GOOD MORNING / NIGHT SIR.  GOD BLESS U ALL SIR.
@WhiteHouse then why did you leave us in such a mess since you became president.


@WhiteHouse Your correct, that's why we don't want them living in a nation full of illegals that don't respect the USA.
i just wish the next president to do what Obama failed which is to make me U.S leader by law and invite me to the white house
- Great work President #BarackObama on #ActOnClimate. Thanks @LeoDiCaprio for your sincere concerns on #ClimateChange

@WhiteHouse "Everybody cares about their kids, their grandkids... forget the massive debt we pass on to them." —President Obama
@WhiteHouse Save the planet but kill the children in the womb.  #UtterHypocrisy #EvenSoComeLordJesus.
YOU raise financially physically&emotionally unwanted children. I decide YOUR health. Will do.
Dear President, you have been one of the amazing President USA had in last couple of decades..
@WhiteHouse really. You seem to not care about any kids future
@WhiteHouse Ah, not really Barack.  In fact, we PRETEND to care about kids in this country but guns, violence, poverty say no.
@WhiteHouse Everyone except you! #ShamefulLegacy
In my opinion, you are the best President the USA had ever before. You have done more good for the world than all before you!
@WhiteHouse as long as the government keeps there freaking paws off them, they will be fine.
Dear Mr @POTUS Barack @POTUS
What you where talking about is perfectly normal need fo a father. I have the same wishes as you.
@WhiteHouse -Just words...always, just words!
Well said. You always say the gracious thing. Your heart is always in the right place. You’ve been a wonderful president.
is this why you're trying to destroy our country and divide the races?
Amazing, sounds good to help in any way we can.
@WhiteHouse not my right wing family They still think it's all about them Not me tho Difficult to deal with BBoomer relatives
