Why won't Congress just do their jobs?
when you have a bunch of manchildren who oppose anything Obama proposes, not doing their jobs is what they want
unfortunate but so true...
every day the republicans prove that party over country is their policy

@SoniaChopra28 This might dispel the doubts Americans have on Judge Garland.
Congress has to do its job and agree
Congress will do nothing as long as President Obama is in the White House.

Liberal
Anti 2A
Elitist

Palabras utilizadas por las principales mentes legales para describir al JuezGarland:Fenomenal excepcionalmente brillante justo
A good man no doubt but he will not be serving on The Supreme Court anytime soon.
a few words to describe Barry: arrogant, traitor, corrupt. The U.K. shoved their collective boot up your ass.
You r wasting our tax dollars your salary is paid with on this. Do something constructive like stop ISIS.
I think this is called 'Flogging a dead horse'! Not going to happen Mr. President.
