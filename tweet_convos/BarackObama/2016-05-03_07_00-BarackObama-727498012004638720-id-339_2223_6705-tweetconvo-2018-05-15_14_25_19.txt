@bhakti_dvn1d @BarackObama    hello bhakti
@BarackObama thanks for all you do and still doing 
@Aakashmaheshw17 congratulations USA
except in Nevada - your hypocritical buddy Warren Buffett saw to that #shameonwarren
@BarackObama hope for more solar power plant in india
@BarackObama Great news...now it's time to cut government subsidies and let them stand on their own
@gino_peters @BarackObama after we cut oil subsidies.
@TassajaraRd @BarackObama I don't disagree with that either.  And cut subsidies to GE, Apple and others
@BarackObama I just had my solar installed yesterday!  Maybe I was number 1 million!   I'd love to tell you about it
@BarackObama I just went Solar!   I pray I will meet you someday...I support you and worked hard on your campaigns.   Please reach out to me
a solar company is going broke, you need to check your facts,  how many birds have you killed with the panels???
This is awesome, but the State of NV PUC is shafting solar companies AND solar Citizens by changing the rules after the fact
and headed towards 20 trillion in debt! Mission accomplished huh Millhouse
Problem is that we renters cannot take advantage of these programs.  Why not give us some portability options??
Keep it coming. We need more alternative energy R&D.
@BarackObama how can the poor people be part of the investments? The 1% are finding ways of leading their solar products @solarcity  #BCorp
@BarackObama que dieu bénisse l’Amérique
@BarackObama That's weird! I don't know one person with solar panels.
@BarackObama we would have 3x that if you didn't piss away all of our money to the Middle East
@BarackObama proud to be one of the million. #ActOnClimate #solarhome
@BarackObama how much govt $$ did it take?!? Such disgraceful, wasteful spending.
@BarackObama how much will that cost us
@BarackObama 
Now is the time to plan for SOLAR WASTE. Anticipation engenders good planning.
@BarackObama @Rev4NY Since solar is ineffective >18hrs/day, need a tech like ours so all NYers can go 100% RE 24/7.
@BarackObama Great effort Mr president.The entire world should utlize the solar renewable energy effectively to produce electricity
@BarackObama thats a drop in the ocean!  Get real!
.@BarackObama, You should see what's going on in Nevada. @solarcity and others leaving. @NVEnergy increased hook up fees for solar only.
@BarackObama @OFA @SgyYogarajah RIGHT PATH& UNDERSTANDING OF YOURS TO REDUCE C C & REQUIREMENTS OF ELECTRICITY. GOOD FOLLOWED BY ALL COUNTRY

Take away those taxpayer subsidies and let's see how many get installed.

@BarackObama hi

@BarackObama Hey what happened to the asshats that used to whine about Solyndra all the time? Their silence is deafening....and amusing.
@BarackObama fantastic Sir. A noble idea to safe mother nature and reduce global warming. Salute to you.
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama @tavleen_singh good but will surpass u in numbers & capacity with @narendramodi @ helm of affairs.

@BarackObama Love it.
@BarackObama Awesome!
@BarackObama I'm thrilled with that news but how does that fix your deficit?
@BarackObama Almost as bad as bragging about all the newly insured people under Obamacare.  How excited about subsidies can one get?
@BarackObama what a wonderful initiative to all
Marking a milestone! The U.S. just hit 1 million #solar installations—enough to power 5.5 million homes. #MillionSolarStrong @BarackObama
Thanks @BarackObama - and as one of the hundreds of thousands working in the industry, happy to be part of it. #greenjobs #solarjobs #solar

@BarackObama Excellent. Next step, I'd like to see the @POTUS driving around in a Tesla or a bolt
@BarackObama But Trump will take it all from us and use it for his own gain if he moves frw in this.
@BarackObama Remember when the Chinese flooded the market with cheap solar panels to stave off US production and then every blamed you?
@BarackObama @IjeomaOgud if only our Nigerian Federal Govt. Can install solar panels in Borno and Sokoto,it can power d whole of west Africa
@BarackObama @Suni_Anand01 we need this!
@BarackObama we never start for #NIGERIA

@BarackObama 
Great achievement. Prompt action towards greener tomorrow.
@BarackObama I always thought a national goal of solar on every roof would have been an excellent national goal
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I love solar energy. To bad that it's really expensive in the most need it countries like South America!!!
@BarackObama At what cost to the tax payer in sudsidies ? How much have the solar producers had in grants ?
@BarackObama Ghana needs help
@BarackObama Wow this is splendid... I wish Africa, particularly Nigeria could half as much within the decade!!!
@BarackObama Mr. Pres, my home is one of them and I would not invest in Solar again. Renewables will not survive without incentives.
@BarackObama 
Great news indeed. Kindly push for high emission countries to do so and more. The Paris agreement needs action than words.
