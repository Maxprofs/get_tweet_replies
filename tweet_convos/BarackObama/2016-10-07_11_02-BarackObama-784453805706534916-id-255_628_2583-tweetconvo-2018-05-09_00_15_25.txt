Funny.Are you trying to convince yourself or your people?tell them who is going to pay the national debt $ 19 trillion.
We're going to continue paying for it, the same way we've been doing it for generations: crediting bank accounts.
@politico minimum wage jobs are the new.middle class
what a joke. That's where Hillary gets those strange beliefs.
your either a reptilian shapeshifter..coward. Robot ..Or your unaware of the extra terrestrial presence on and off earth
this is a historical moment,a chinese college boy is commenting the  Presendent of the United States of Amarica's twitter.
@politico ELECTRONIC HARASSMENT IS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL THEREFORE OBAMA IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT! THE GOVERNMENT IS HERE BY CLOSED!
@politico you didn't create shit!!
you are obviously living in la-la land or something because out here in the real world the economy SUCKS!! Thanks for that.
I wonder if @POTUS @BarackObama really gave up his college cocaine habit. No lucid individual says his nonsense. He might even believe it.
@politico WE DEMAND THAT YOU OBAMA TO SURRENDER YOUR AUTHORITY IMMEDIATELY END ELECTRONIC TORTURE! YOU ARE NO LONGER PRESIDENT!
/ GOOD MORNING / NIGHT SIR. HAVE A NICE SUNDAY WITH A PRAYER SIR. GOD BLESS U ALL.

@politico 8 years too late.
@politico who told you that???????
becoming

stranger 

Scourer

I like the numbers showing the economy continues to grow.  Great! Meanwhile, floundering Trump will dismiss the good news.
@politico nice job lifting the sanctions on Iran regarding their nuclear weapons program!
@politico ummm WRONG!
@politico Well my news station is showing three Anarchy's so how exactly is our economy on the rise? Better rise money my way!
@HillaryClinton will continue the growth,expand ops for all. GOP? Cut tax for rich, repeal regs,cause next recession

@politico Thanks all you waiters and part timers thanks OBama
/ Good Morning / Night . Have A Nice Week Ending Day  Sir. God Hanuman  Bless U All.
How is our military?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs … has collapsed.  Stop so and so of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation ….
Obama is a liar and should be impeached for interfering with the current election.
@politico interesting
My retire $$ a third to half of 5 yrs.ago,better?Can't work 40-60 hrs NOW, OR get job per experi: "over qualified/dont say old"
Sure it is! Debt has doubled since ur tenure! Hitting the kool aid again?
Jobs aren't going to fix the economy.   The government needs to put their money in the bank and take it out to help people.
@politico Bet you thought in '04&06 the economy was better, stronger too! Couldn't see a bubble then. Bet you can't see it now
I know it's hard for people to see because every community is different, but I've benefited. Also plz repeal ACA
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @HilaryClinton strong vibrant economy. Not doomsday Trump & hatchet man "Mad Dog" RuffRudf Giuliani claim
@politico https://twitter.com/neilturner_/status/784493198970421249 …
@politico I hope the next president continues this trend in job numbers
@politico Manufacturing makes for better economy
If you keep repeating this, will it make it true??  Maybe if you are comparing today to the early 90's! 
@politico keep acting like the economy is great. It hurts Hillary.
@politico 
Really? It is? Because pretty sure I am still struggling to find anyone who will hire full time.
@politico   Only if food stamps=pay check, welfare=job. That's where the real increases are.
@politico you Barack amazing
drug dealers are up seen 3 deals yesterday what jobs are talking   What jobs are you talking
¡SEÑOR OBAMAAAAA!
@politico right
@politico Teach Black Leaders how to grow an economy not just siphoning of public funds especially Nigeria
@politico more lies
HE SHOULD ASK THE MID-CLASS AND LOW INCOME PPL. WHAT THEY THINK. MOST CAN`T WAIT TILL YOUR OUT OF OFFICE.
Right.  Let's see you attempt to survive with one of these so-called new jobs and support your family. Too little, too late.
@politico NOPE. 

AND, still waiting for your apology for Obamacare...my family is suffering because of you.  #neverhillary
@politico
@politico
-Thank You POTUS OBAMA, Maconnell words are worthless and make the republican party shameful, the end of their party
@politico Hey Obama , COPEESH!??
@politico keep going Mr President you are still doing a very good job?
@politico You keep telling yourself that big fat lie!!!!!!!!
is so marginal.  I regret voting for him twice.  Thanks for all the war and Wallstreet Fraud that you've done nothing to stop.
Is that why the unemployment rate is going back up now?
Yeh by solding all your weapons to ISIS & slaughtring innocent Muslims in syria,iraq,afghanistan,yemen etc..
Right!  Cumulative figures say every American now has 4 jobs, including kids!
I agree
@politico 
Thanx O
@politico  Somehow @realDonaldTrump will blame you that it wasn't 300K or take credit for it... You rock Mr. President!  Thank!

Our commitment to support jobs creation and address skills gap @BarackObama @politico @AdeccoGroup @GAN4Youth
@politico You're not funny. Stop trying to make jokes.
@politico 
its sad to think all the good work you've done is mostly unnoticed & will be undone by the moron that will take your place.
@politico if you for one second think that you have improved this country, your blind to how divided we have become.
@politico THERE IS ALWAYS JOBS DURING ELECTION YRS EVER NOTICE THAT STOP LYING OBAMA AMERICA HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR LEADERSHIP
@politico you should not be paid if your going to campaign with Hillary
$1.4T deficit for 2016, $19.5T debt, records for # on snap program, disability, house ownership down, low GDP growth...
@politico The U-6 is nearly 10%. Probably higher since many govt departments hide facts to prop you up.
