@WhiteHouse @Chisportsnut How about tuition waived at CC rates wherever you go? CCs not best choice for grad and prof school bound.
@nymelb86 @WhiteHouse yes but this being what it is baby steps...
@Chisportsnut @WhiteHouse I would rather have it than not. But faculty at CCs not offering research exp kids need to be competitive for..
@Chisportsnut @WhiteHouse for Ph.D programs, end up in MA programs to get competitive, adding 2 more years on later. Give em a waiver ...
@nymelb86 @WhiteHouse that might work ...
@Chisportsnut @WhiteHouse you could make it competitive...for 4 years.
@WhiteHouse @thepoliticalcat Great IDEA!
but sadly i found, that most teenagers do NOT want to really WORK any harder than it takes to text!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
great step
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hello Mr president  I just wanted to know if you are making anything for immigrants before your time in office
@WhiteHouse Nothing free who paying.Basically Pell eligible go free already w/state grants books paid. Low graduation rates no skin in game.
@WhiteHouse fabulous!!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama cheapest place 2 build an educational institution is Detroit. also, Y pay 4 tutors when collectively it's cheaper
@WhiteHouse put more burdens on the taxpayer and more government control nothing like having marxism!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama try to be president for greatest country on the world and take decision against ISIS ......forget to catch banana ?
@WhiteHouse yeah, cause why should anyone have to work for their own education and success.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
 thank you
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama How creative it would be if your such a good message is followed by the whole World,
@WhiteHouse This is beautiful, and very encouraging to the many students who face financial difficulties in order to go to college.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama "work for it"? Please. Enabler.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Just say "no" to free college and raising our taxes...
@WhiteHouse You command an education to get a career,succumbing to corporations. Working b/c the noose around our poverty stricken necks.
@WhiteHouse with all respect Mr. President, America is a Continent not a country. You as an educated person should know the difference...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama There is nothing free in this world. Someone is always paying for anything that is produced #Communism
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Would this be for midlife career changers as well?
@WhiteHouse What a great idea. Of course naysayers will go for it after U r out of office. Christians I guess.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 安全対策は、大事である。
@WhiteHouse help ZUMA tell him that a white guy is not the end of the world or there freedom just a better life ZUMA suck ZUMA suck!!!

@WhiteHouse Great idea, overdue, better now than never! Truly like Community Colleges, super!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama SIR NEED A RESPECTABLE JOB FROM YOU NO 1 PERSON IN THE WORLD. STAYING CALCUTTA. INDIA.AGE 62 AND SCIENCE GRADUATE.
@WhiteHouse @Greeenguy111 Before that, the community colleges need better oversight & increased accreditation scrutiny.
@TovarRasputin @WhiteHouse I think that is much more needed by for-profit colleges.
@WhiteHouse STOP TALKING ABOUT TRUMP! THIS IS IMPORTANT & VALUABLE! People please, support this & thank Obama for getting it together
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Thank you!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama call me I'll provide my story on how not to incur college debt and get a college education, I'm in the book
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama no more freebies because someone has to pay
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama No such thing as a free ride. You mean raise taxes to give more freebees. Someone must pay for it.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama http://dailycurrant.com/2015/09/07/sarah-palin-native-americans-should-go-back-to-nativia-3/ … HELP HER?!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yeah right!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I think this is a great idea!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama let's be thinking about 4-year undergraduate universities too.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Hey d.a.n, no such thing as free! Someone is paying for the freebies! It's the middle class
@WhiteHouse the only way I afforded college was GI Bill help...you are so right...again!!!!!
@WhiteHouse Obama said work for it. Now that's funny
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That'd be massive ! Keep up the good work!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What do students attending 4year colleges receive for their hard work...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama please stop the war in Siria!! Kill the terrorists. It is not fair for the refugees!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Tropez wanted to blow up the white house. Your friends isis
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how are we funding this when schools are struggling? What about the Americans who struggle to pay school loans?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama many colleges provide amenities 4 students that need $$ 4 upkeep. Colleges rethink plan. Cut amenities lower cost.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that isn't a link to the actual proposed bill. Come on Boss man.
@WhiteHouse So, whats the difference in working for community college and paying for it in advance?  Makes no sense
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Hello Mr. President
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama http://tw.gofund.me/p92wyyx4 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That would change a lot of things A lot of idle minds off streets in classroom earning wage.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama free if you're willing to work for it? Soo it's not free now is it. No wonder this country is so fucked up.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama wish you would do more to curb the murdering of unarmed people of color by corrupt cops. #blacklivesmatter
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama thanks Obama now I can actually pay for college #4moreyears ?
@whitehouse lets make community college free for everyone in america together we can
@whitehouse @barackobama @POTUS has pass the touch of confidence to @kanyewest to run for president
@WhiteHouse let's lower the value of a degree by making everyone get one. Brilliant idea, and make American taxpayers foot the bill. Stupid
@WhiteHouse My son is currently taking college classes in High School.He is able to graduate HS with an associates.Why not help offset costs
@WhiteHouse Why not work with 4 year colleges to help reduce costs of the 4 year college.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Sounds good!  maybe than young kids would be more encourage to be something, because they will have a chance!
@WhiteHouse Why not work with colleges to have more credits, if not all credits transfer from community to 4 year degree.
@WhiteHouse Community College is NOT a lifetime of debt.It has a reasonable cost vs that of a 4 yr college."Free" is not always the answer.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
God with us
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 7 years in still no ideas.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama thank you sir!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama http://Itorres.myitworks.com

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama - on the right track Mr. President, but Books and Parking are expensive!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yeah!  Free college for those who want to change their lives
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Настоящий президент своей страны и своего народа.
@WhiteHouse How stupid does he think we are? It's like I take your iPhone away & give it to someone else & say here ya go, it's free.
@WhiteHouse  Powerful action that will open up the doors to thousands of students and allow students to save grants and loans for later.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that's pretty mainstream again. #freehandouts
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 無料はいいですね。
@WhiteHouse What about study loan relief? #studentdebt
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
I will be so happy to get my degree so I can qualify to work with NASA ..hopefully within the next 10 years.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  It should be free as a quality of being an American Citizen. Join the movement to make each Human's Life Better.

@WhiteHouse one of the better ideas you've had. As a single mother going to school to get my degree and working a full time job.
@WhiteHouse join the marxist movement to destroy citizens by putting more burdens on them!
@WhiteHouse Yeah I agree with Obama
@WhiteHouse REMEMBER BENGHAZI THE 4 AMERICANS YOU DID NOT HELP!
@WhiteHouse I agree.  Community college should be free. 
@WhiteHouse a degree doesn't equal wisdom,  morals or success. Many professors denounce faith in God and lead people astray!  Enough!
@WhiteHouse what should be addressed is the cost of college and the absurd amount professors are paid. Stop enslaving people.
@WhiteHouse What will admission standards be? Far to many HS "graduates" can't even use proper grammar.
@WhiteHouse 
Way to go Mr President less than 600 days fills two yrs of historical performance one in a million Mr President.
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS #spoileralert Community college profs are already overworked and underpaid. How do we fix that first? #HeadsUpAmerica
@WhiteHouse W/ last. That, seeing how they handle Life, and choices, including college or not, (cont) http://tl.gd/nkqtsr 
@WhiteHouse why the transfer requirement? Community college educators are often suboptimal, so we are propagating a problem.
@WhiteHouse the community agitator at it again. Exploiting the naive and desperate
@WhiteHouse Aren't we, the people, actually "working" for it? & the entitlement recipients really not having to work for much? YAY FREEBIES
@WhiteHouse Not economically right, nor right per developing the character of these new adults and/or seeing their choices, & how they plan.
@WhiteHouse NOTHING if FREE!
@WhiteHouse -already done in state of tennessee - lottery footing bill...who will pay for this across US? Taxpayers?
@WhiteHouse I like you
@WhiteHouse Translation: As president of Latin America & Lunatic America I intend to educate the illegal immigrants I let into the country
@WhiteHouse No more "free" stuff. If an education is worth it, it is worth paying 4. Work hard & EARN your way in the world.
@WhiteHouse Forgive #studentdebt!!!
@WhiteHouse You are out of money. Stop spending. Stop borrowing. Cut up the cards. Talk to @DaveRamsey. No, *listen* to Dave Ramsey.
@WhiteHouse Yep, it's free and as our economy continues to implode with programs like this, we can expect little hope of employment.
@jmgraceland @WhiteHouse Community college is already an inexpensive alternative to higher education. "Free" just means someone else pays.
@curticemang @WhiteHouse Someone else being you and I...
@jmgraceland @WhiteHouse To which Obama would ask, "Yeah, so what's your point?"
@WhiteHouse this is a good idea ....what can we do to support this effort?
@WhiteHouse Nothing is free!!! Hardworking middle class taxpayers will pay for it.
@WhiteHouse @CFKArgentina  @CasaRosadaAR  con respeto señora aprenda a mirar a otros países.. No sólo criticarlos. Argentina esta hundida
@WhiteHouse so will the staff/faculty of CCs work 4 free? How do they get paid?
@WhiteHouse Thanks for adding more debt for MY generation to pay off, much appreciated
@WhiteHouse listen morons it already is in Jefferson County Ohio. Why? Because voters wanted it. You want it? Move there.
@WhiteHouse so you're willing to tax the middle class kids out of college to pay for others to go?

Why do you hate America?
@WhiteHouse Soooooo, ur gonna make Comm College free for conservatives? POTUS is channeling dead crazy people, again.
@WhiteHouse Anything "free" isn't worth having. @POTUS Sometimes? I feel as if I am raising man-children. Geez! Barry.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Work earns value. Struggle begets worth.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS On the basics of the Protestant Ethical System. America's foundation of value.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS The Community College System we have in place serves a great purpose at fair prices. If it ain't broke...
@WhiteHouse every past Gov program to reduce cost of higher Ex has increased cost in long run stilly
@WhiteHouse Great American President,God Bless Him!
@WhiteHouse I'm in. Love president Obama.
@whitehouse So it's not enough that I work and save to one day send three kids to school?
@WhiteHouse um, NO. Most people getting degrees today are better off. without them.  This will increase debt and cost of high Ed in long run
@WhiteHouse yet you and your wife are supposed to being honest about everyone thinking together.
@WhiteHouse END THE WAR ON DRUGS SIR !!!
@WhiteHouse 
@BarackObama, once we taught Latin/Greek in HS, now teach remedial English in college. Social Justice destroyed education
@WhiteHouse  it's not free.
No it shouldn’t. Life isn’t fair or 'free'. RT @WhiteHouse

@WhiteHouse Sorry tired of paying someone else way. Got my own bills no ones helping me with.
@WhiteHouse yes please! This would help my partner & I so much. We could finally be a fully independent couple.
.@whitehouse Does "work for it" mean "getting in people's faces" about it?
Yes. @anthropocon @WhiteHouse What else would it mean? Cleaning a grease trap? Please.
@dicentra33 I've cleaned a few grease traps in my day. Learned it's best to do w/ a stuffy nose @anthropocon @WhiteHouse
No joke. @SumErgoMonstro @anthropocon But it's not as gross as the garbage produced by the dishwashers. At least grilled stuff is burnt dead

@D1N49GEE @WhiteHouse Excuse me but I DO have a job. I want to get my Bach. so I can have a better position. Also: Learn to use punctuation.
Is it just me, @WhiteHouse, or is something missing here? http://headsupamerica.us/  #headsiwintailsyoulose
@JerylBier @WhiteHouse NO, AND THINKING ABOUT NO, GET THE PICTURE FREE, REALLY FREE COST SOMEONE FREE NOT TO TAXPAYERS!

@WhiteHouse sorry.  as a tax-paying, hard-working, law-abiding American citizen, I can't afford to send everyone ELSE to school.
.@WhiteHouse there's no such thing as free, and it's not free if you're earning it. Who writes these tweets?
@AmeliaHammy @WhiteHouse My God, the Marxist is so strong in this one.
@Gregory__Adams @AmeliaHammy @WhiteHouse Apparently someone doesn't know that the "government" that pays for this stuff is the taxpayers.
