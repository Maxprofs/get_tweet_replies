@BarackObama So let's sign a trade deal that will outsource the jobs that your administration worked so hard to add. This makes no sense.
@jacob_b_shaver If "it makes no sense," maybe Liz has it wrong this time.
@swilli0521 Democrats are so split on this issue. President Obama finds himself on the side that panders to corporate America. Hmmm. . .
@BarackObama Ok you said the economy added a record of jobs in april but yet the black unemployment rate is still high
@BarackObama  And HOW MANY of those jobs paid a LIVING WAGE. Top 1% controls 43% of the wealth in Am. Sir #TakeCareOfMainStreetNotJustWallSt
@BarackObama @milkdud41 but people are still gonna say you're our worst president in history smh
@RoryOConnor63 Honestly, if they looked at the damn statistical facts... it's really upsetting that people can't read numbers.
@milkdud41 it's just a bunch of people that can't find a whole to blame so they pick a single figure to blame: like the president
@RoryOConnor63 99% of those who criticize Obama don't understand his policies or that they've created progressive socio-economic growth.
@milkdud41 99% are kids in high school who think they're so informed because they took a government class for a year
@BarackObama The economy added 223,000 jobs in April-1/3 of the jobs lost in the prior years of your being king.
@BarackObama the whole society also consists of poor people who just want to be part of  the society
@BarackObama And what exactly did the gov't do for PRIVATE sector jobs? Not a damn thing idiot. PRIVATE sector dude, learn what it means.
@Truth_Does_Hurt @BarackObama Are you an idiotic comment generator? I honestly laughed for 5 minutes by the irony of your name.
@TariroJakachira You obviously don't understand the difference between PRIVATE and PUBLIC sector. Obama has nothing to do with PRIVATE.
@AnonClassWar @TariroJakachira Dude, stop hitting thw bong bc you obviously have no fucking clue what you're talking about.
@AnonClassWar Do you realize Dems vote AGAINST anti slavery laws many times and against multiple amendments abolishing slavery. See, blame.
@BarackObama Glad America's getting back on its feet again.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Lets PLEASE close our borders and let the AMERICANS get jobs ;) I am for LEGAL immigration ;)
@BarackObama # great job!
@BarackObama yeah but most of them are part-time jobs at minimum wage with no insurance. Small companies can't afford it,
@BarackObama Greetings Mr Obama i need a job can you please help me .
@TheJob98329 i trued it and dieant work
@BarackObama your going to have to get busy and figure a way to stop that. America's doing ok in spite of you
@BarackObama  Remember that the investors and the private-sector is also part of the society. The society consisting of human beeings.
