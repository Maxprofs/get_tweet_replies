.@BarackObama #SecureTheBorder 1st! You ILLEGALY granted #Amnesty to 5M Illegals! It's a slap in the face to LEGAL immigrants! #NoAmnesty!
@angelacarwile @barackobama Last night #Obama openly #Grubered this Nation !
My words exactly..."We just got #Grubered " His motives are purely political. He doesn't care about reform.@DefendersMC_USA @BarackObama
@angelacarwile @DefendersMC_USA @BarackObama it's to take down America. It's his own personal grudge.
His fundamental transformation of America is nearly complete! @MarciaCrocker01 @DefendersMC_USA @BarackObama pissed off >1/2 the country!
@angelacarwile @DefendersMC_USA @BarackObama We have to fight..we are the bosses...The usurper works for us..time to let him know.
Amen Marcia! I'm sick of this lawless pResident acting as if he's above the law! @MarciaCrocker01 @DefendersMC_USA @BarackObama Yeah YOU!
@angelacarwile @DefendersMC_USA @BarackObama I am fixing to take a chance.no more paying taxes.If we all did this in April..would cripple DC
@BarackObama That was my favorite part... challenge congress and make them actually do something to benefit this country for once
you do know the fuck didn't do shit on immigration when Dems controlled Congress? Time to impeach the SOB @Jeremy_Lynn @BarackObama
@Crunched4time no, he was kinda busy stopping a recession, bailing out the auto industry and passing health care reform... get a clue, moron
@Crunched4time also, not doing it in the first 2 years.... NOT AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE!!!
@BarackObama It's you grow a goatee, sir.  Grow a goatee, and go full on bad ass on these people. Who barely represent 23% of the country.
@JSPartisan @BarackObama LOL- 23% yet hold a majority in both houses of Congress?... REALLY, how's that work
@FullArmorCloth It's called MATH and MID-TERMS.  Look it up.  They hardly represent anyone.  The President still has more of a mandate.
@JSPartisan LOOK IT UP MAN! Thru history Congress's who do the People's will remain in power through Mid-Terms. Get real!
@LynnPolit @JSPartisan I'd say the results actually have VERY much validated this mid-term election.
@LynnPolit @FullArmorCloth He's the President.  You disrespectful...

@BarackObama No Executive order is legal #legislationwithoutrepresentation
@BarackObama They did that decades ago.  They set legal path to citizenship and they financed a border patrol. Executive's job to enforce.
 “@BarackObama: "those of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better … Pass a bill." —President Obama”

@BarackObama That's right, be the leader we elected!!!!!!
“@BarackObama: To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better… Pass a bill.” @SenatorReid
@BarackObama they're not even in session, give them tine before you act, or just sign an eo to get rid of congress.
@BarackObama   Thank you, Congress please do your job. This is a peaceful start to a troublesome problem that has existed for years.
@BarackObama You are the only one that can help the people that follow the law, Why legalice "the ilegal" instead of help all legal resident
“@BarackObama: "To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better … Pass a bill." Damnnn
@BarackObama What happen with residents/citizens that pay taxes/inmigration FEES following the law and have to wait 15 year for familyreunif
@BarackObama question your authority?! If they never approved the bill you can't pass it!!!!
@BarackObama When are we going to realize that immigration has already been address and resolved just follow the policy not hard at all.>S<O
@BarackObama @roryuphold Spoken by the king of "passing the bill".
@BarackObama you suck
@BarackObama Taxpayers don't want to pay for these illegals. We need the jobs that ur giving away. Why do u hate America so much???????
@BarackObama tell that tea Mr president
Obama -YOU question the authority to take the action YOU just questioned Congress on! @BarackObama #copolitics
“@BarackObama: "To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better … Pass a bill." That sass"
@BarackObama .l.
@BarackObama I agree. Also, THANK YOU for continuing to do the best that you can with the mess you INHERITED, despite all the haters.
@BarackObama But, that's exactly the point.  You can't just do what you want when they don't act like you want.
@BarackObama pai hk
@BarackObama @GottliebShow fuckin told em
@BarackObama Presidents Reagan and GHW Bush also went around Congress on immigration. http://bit.ly/1vwa46j 
@BarackObama KIIIINNNNNKKKKAAAAAAAANNNNNNNN!!!!!
@BarackObama Article II, Section 3, enforce the current law!
@BarackObama yes you did, and we have your back...OFA Minnesota
To @BarackObama kiss my ass, you are not a dictator so stop acting like a spoiled child prince.
@BarackObama You don't want a bill that protects citizens & our jobs. U R ANRI-AMETICAN WORKER!
“@BarackObama: "To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better … Pass a bill."" 
@BarackObama @GottliebShow Hey, genius. Rules are already there via Constitution. Congress wrote rules of naturalization. States enforce.
@BarackObama @GottliebShow If you don't apply the current laws on the books, why should they?
@BarackObama. REPUBLICAN`TS can't deliver. Immigrants aren't humans for them.
We thank you mr President.Our full support to you.#TNTweeters
@BarackObama @GottliebShow they'll pass a bill that's best for the USA.The question is, will you sign it?
@BarackObama Seconded!!! Tell it to their face.
@BarackObama ; Well done Mr President @BarackObama
@BarackObama Pass a bill just so Obama can veto it!?!? Good idea prez.....like we didn't see that coming!! #ImpeachObama
@BarackObama @GottliebShow Well you did have control of congress for many years????
@BarackObama GET THE BILLS OFF OLD HARRYS DESK!
@BarackObama @Momiitz: Congress "pass a bill"? Wont't happen because they can't get their sh#* together and do what's best for the people!
@BarackObama if you think the prez is wrong on this #Pass the Bill and stop the mumering
@BarackObama  terrorist
@BarackObama So, thats meant for Harry right?  The bills are sitting on his desk.
@BarackObama @GottliebShow you are by far the worst president ever!!! Shut up and finish your term out you piece of shit
@BarackObama @GottliebShow Barry had 2 years with control of congress. If so urgent a matter why not 'pass a bill' then? Pure politics.
@BarackObama so if I do not get what I want, I can go out and break the law? Between your putt and tee shot please reply.
@BarackObama @GottliebShow   sorry sir, you have no power without the Congress it is designed that way on purpose.
@BarackObama @GottliebShow just because a bill is passed doesn't guarantee you'll pass it.
@BarackObama @GottliebShow Pass a bill? Mid-terms will make that happen. How about you do your job and don't open terrorists avenues.
@BarackObama @GottliebShow Give them a chance. You and Reid had years and did nothing. Time to grow up and lead.
@BarackObama if illegals cant follow the rules of our country then they can have a free pass out of here.
@BarackObama exec order is NOT the answer. Make immigrants become legal the way our country has done forever.
.@BarackObama 25x YOU said you didn't have Constitutional authority to grant #Amnesty! You are NOT Emperor! #NoAmnesty for Illegals! Period!
@BarackObama p325 yeah , here's the deal Congress passed the laws and then the president acts, not the other way around.
@BarackObama you struck a chord...
@BarackObama If Congress doesn't do their job, then President Obama had no choice but to work by himself!
@BarackObama lying POS
@BarackObama Job well done !! I admired you & respected you before this,now even more.Rain of blessings to you all.
@barackobama @jobfoxonline Idúlizandro Bredy

@BarackObama Awe snap, real talk BO!
@BarackObama Congress has to do a Govt. Shutdown because you Can NOT do this!
@BarackObama Exactly! Its about the lack if meaningful legislation and willingness of Congress to work together
@BarackObama The immigration system is the system of wild capitalism which uses human to run as slaves under minimum wage in discrimination.
@BarackObama You and Reed blocked the republicans every way you could so they couldn't pass bills.  Americans can see through your lies.
@BarackObama thank you president. God bless  immigrants. God bless you.
@BarackObama you are a cynical, ruthless lying opportunist whose insincerity offends & endangers our constitution our liberty & way of life
