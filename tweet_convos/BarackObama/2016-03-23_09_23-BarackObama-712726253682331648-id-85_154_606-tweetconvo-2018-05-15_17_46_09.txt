@joshdoyle888 @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV Everyone should have healthcare. Single-payer saves money and covers all.
@joshdoyle888 @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV Not if it is run right. Why would there be death panels if there is adequate funding?
@joshdoyle888 @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV But people bitch about higher taxes. You can't have it both ways.
@joshdoyle888 @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV We're not going to a dictatorship. But medical bills shouldn't cause bankruptcy.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama maybe you don't understand the definition of "everyone". I guess I am NOT an everyone?
@1MrsOpinionated @SecBurwell @BarackObama That's why we need Bernie's single-payer plan. Everyone covered.
@Fix_Today @SecBurwell @BarackObama oh yes can't wait to see how screwed up healthcare will be when THE CORUPT, INEPT GOVERNMENT controls it
@1MrsOpinionated @SecBurwell @BarackObama You talk about Government like it's a static thing, but it isn't. It can be powerfully effective.
@Fix_Today we compare it to... VA (veterans coverage) because that is not exactly a beacon of success. Name a successful govt. agency?
@1MrsOpinionated Medicare has an 8% overhead. Most efficient in the country. With proper funding, single-payer will be more efficient.
@Fix_Today it's bluntly obvious, me & u don't have remotely similar views, so I am not going to waste further time. Our views won't change.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV DEDPITE THE ABSURD RRPU B KICSN RHETORIC YOU ARE A GREAT MAN AND GREAT PRESIDENT
@buracu123 @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV But he did screw up. Without the public option, healthcare is still our #1 source of bankruptcy.
@SecBurwell Maybe so, but it's getting unaffordable. Insurance companies are feasting off of ACA. We need #singlepayer.
@katbyrd41 @SecBurwell You're damn right we do. Get profit out of the healthcare insurance system.
.@SecBurwell @BarackObama Ive been priced out of the market by rising premiums. It isnt better for me.
@HanaFiveO @SecBurwell @BarackObama When Bernie instills single-payer, you will have affordable healthcare. I'm sorry you don't now.
@Fix_Today @SecBurwell @BarackObama Riiiiiight. No.
@HanaFiveO @SecBurwell @BarackObama No? You think we should have private insurance gouging their customers?
@SecBurwell @BarackObama  thank you for your tweet with the hyperlink to your article. Very enlightening-and encouraging!
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV You're confused. Nothing better, high premiums, deductibles, copays. Dr's refuse to accept, taxpayers screwed
@SrCorlett @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV Time for Bernie's Single-payer to get profit out of healthcare.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama ACA reporting is a nightmare and cost business thousands of dollars on top of insurance. BAD.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama Peds care with no access and 90% care directed to the ER's. $$ not well spent we can do more hand it back to us
@SecBurwell @BarackObama please give the pediatric docs the way to provide far superior care then ER's.  High cost centers will drain us!
@SecBurwell @BarackObama make Peds a priority or we lose prime opportunity to educate generations/prevent dz. Don't miss the chance! Think!
@SecBurwell @BarackObama  Except in Oklahoma where our infamous governor turned her nose up at the help and penalized the whole state.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV unless you're like millions whose premium quadrupled you lost your Dr and your $750 deductible is now $10K FK-O
@JRandall_000 @SecBurwell Once Bernie instances Single-payer, everyone will be covered and save thousands a year.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama Conforms to victory for Hillary, we're supporting, I hope the American people are eligible to vote for the person
@SecBurwell @BarackObama m
@SecBurwell @BarackObama #AsshatInChief @NancyPelosi #Grubered #ACA Thanks for higher premiums, copays & deductibles! Yay!
@SecBurwell @BarackObama mayb that's the feeling that Iv been feeling
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV its getting to the point where people can't afford it! Repeal and start again
@SecBurwell @BarackObama But what about the skyrocketing premiums & deductibles Obamacare has caused?
@SecBurwell @BarackObama R U nuts?
@SecBurwell @BarackObama My healthcare costs have doubled as a young healthy male. Please help poor people Mr. President
@SecBurwell @BarackObama #ACA #ACAanniversary except me, my family, and everyone else we know. Our coverage got much worse. #ThanksObama
@SecBurwell @BarackObama every person in my family is worse off because of this nonsense. Premiums 3 n 4 times higher, copays astronomical
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV we still have a lot more to do!
@SecBurwell @BarackObama Hard math voodoo public $s' going to for profit(ins.Inc./big pharma)- Med+Law+Education-4 profit=BANKRUPTED USA
@SecBurwell not for EVERYONE. We are paying more and getting less. How is that better?

@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV $1600/month as self employed with high deductible and just OK coverage. Up about 35% thanks to our dictator.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama The ACA has been a Godsend to our family.  At 61 my wife lost her coverage and ACA saved us.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama   Yes- yes!
@SecBurwell I'm glad yours is better mine has a 4k deductible I tell my fam they have to be close to death to go to doctor. I still luv O
@SecBurwell @BarackObama could you get me some of that stuff you're smoking? it's the GOOD stuff! @rabuliz
@SecBurwell @BarackObama how nice for those who can afford it or is provided it for free. Me, I'll just take your word for it.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV  TY @POTUS wasn't easy to get ACA, people always dissatisfied, can't pls every1,mass is better than none at all
@BarackObama @SecBurwell My premium has went up at 20% every yr for the past 3 yrs and a 5 digit deductible. Not affordable
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV                                       I NEED DENTAL COVERAGE PLEASE HELP!
@AguayoRosario @SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV Then you love most of his work. But, we do need Bernie's single-payer to help everyone.
@BarackObama @SecBurwell Sayın Başkan geldin gidiyon akan bunca kana bir dur diyemedim Allah katında sorumlusun
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV Unfortunately, insurance companies are not quite on board. Deductibles are 2 high & actual coverage is 2 low.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @BV is thia chick for real?
@SecBurwell @BarackObama
