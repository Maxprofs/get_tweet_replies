@SalesPacer @POTUS @noxyplanet @WhiteHouse If it is, then why is Obama taking ALL the credit for it??
@terrimore1 @SalesPacer @POTUS @noxyplanet @WhiteHouse Because he won't be denied; he wants ALL the power & not sharing with anyone else!
@diane4CommonSen @terrimore1 @SalesPacer @POTUS @WhiteHouse Obama is one of the best president America ever had
@noxyplanet @diane4CommonSen @SalesPacer @POTUS @WhiteHouse You say that bc He is half white. But I think hes the worst & Ive seen many.

@whitehouse @potus @andrewzimmern and plenty of the american auto industry now gets to enjoy lead in their drinking water. rescued!
IT is not making cars, which produces lead in drinking water, @mikestable @WhiteHouse @POTUS @andrewzimmern . Its the WAY they do it.

@JHWillson @WhiteHouse @POTUS WRONG - JUST REPUBLICAN SMOKE SCREEN BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY TO KEEP HIM FROM ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING.
@criticality2285 do your homework pal. 20,000 RETIREES would disagree with you! https://www.delphisalariedretirees.org/delphi/  @WhiteHouse @POTUS
Mr. @JHWillson - A countrys development = currency exchange rate development. Just Check USD! @POTUS has done #WELL! (I'm European)

@WhiteHouse @POTUS por favor, que significa exactamente @POTUS? (intuyo que se refiere al actual Gobierno,..)
@WhiteHouse @POTUS so how much did taxpayers and bond holders lose in the GM bailout?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
Results are outstanding and honestly speak for themselves to every thinking intelligent citizen except the "deniers" .
@WhiteHouse @POTUS didn't they get a bail out? To bad us commoners couldn't get a bail out! But the refugees get a big hand out?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS lol reliable source #propagandistInCheif
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  So I hope. That you''re paying for this purely political trip out of your own picket and not mine!
@WhiteHouse @andrewzimmern @POTUS #madeinamerica is a bit of a stretch, considering how much of the manufacturing is actually done here.

@judiekstein @WhiteHouse @POTUS  but screw those evil banks and all their employees right.  You only care cause it affected you! #simplemind
@DustinCartee @WhiteHouse @POTUS 
Dustin, I worked for Citibank in mid 80s when they were REAL. Want ALL employees treated fairly
@DustinCartee 
My job eventually got "outsourced". Who knew a Philippine would do 1/8 my job for a banana leaf? We ALL lost
@DustinCartee Saddest part is they settled for 1/8 of the job being done. That opened doors to lackadaisical standards becoming norm.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS definently
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Anyone can cherry pick numbers from the bottom of the market. You spent the taxpayers money on failing companies.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Thank you Mr. President!
