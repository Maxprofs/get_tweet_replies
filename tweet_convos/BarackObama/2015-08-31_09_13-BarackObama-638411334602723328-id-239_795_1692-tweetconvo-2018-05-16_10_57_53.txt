@skorpyos @WhiteHouse @POTUS nick @skorpyos loves to get his free government handouts and free medical care via the tax payer
@HerringDonald don't hate on my success.
@skorpyos sorry I gotta get back to work . Some has to pay for all the illegal aliens like nick @skorpyos.  They like freebies.
@HerringDonald you get paid by the hour I'm sure.
@skorpyos with out rednecks Like me, you wouldn't have this beautiful country to flee when your country man fuck you in the ass.
@skorpyos it's clear to me that you have an inferiority complex when it comes white Americans.
@HerringDonald my success proves otherwise.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS let's keep the Arctic oil and tar sands in the ground as a start to curb climate change!
@andybrwn @WhiteHouse @POTUS GIVE IRAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO THREATEN US WITH LIKE N. KOREA  NOTHING WILL DESTROY THE PLANET FASTER SO SHUT-UP
@glassman_keith might want to check your meds. You're yelling again
@andybrwn  A REASON TO YELL. WHY ARE YOU SO INTERESTED IN CURBING OUR USE OF OIL AND ENERGY AND YET FIND LETTING IRAN ENRICH URANIUM IS OK??
@glassman_keith UN security counsel backs and countries negotiated. Non weapon grade isotopes only, and quantities tracked.
@andybrwn They are only doing it for $$$  UK economy in the tank they need Iran  They are hurting by the sanctions too...THIS IS A BAD DEAL
@glassman_keith deal in hand is better than none. Anti-proliferation community (an some in Israeli defense) agree on that point.
@andybrwn I do not trust Obama nor do I trust Iran...Bring better people to the table and maybe consider it but NO WAY NOT THE WAY IT IS NOW
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  Mr.President you Lead we as a generation will follow... Forever.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 1) We r way behind on climate change, if man made is major cause. Put a lot of funding into CO2 recapture...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 2) This is the kind of thing we should be looking at. http://www.gizmag.com/c02-atmosphere-carbon-nanofibers/39015/ …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 3) capitalism is a colossus and it will take too long to steer it on course to reduce at sufficient rate!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 4) Eventually methane is the time bomb. Once we hit that tipping point, shalom Planet Earth.
