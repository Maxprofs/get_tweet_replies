@missambear @sanfranpk @Defective14 STRIKE THREE
@robynkanner friends who block together stay together
@missambear look at this jerk tryin' to slide in. HE'S OUT.
@BarackObama you didn't give anyone a choice. derp.
@alwaysonoffense you do have a choice.  Don't get insurance.  Pay the penalty. BarackObama
@Joe35357 "do this or i will break your leg" is not a choice.
@alwaysonoffense do you even know what the penalty is?
@Joe35357 @alwaysonoffense 2% of your income is quite a bit.
@am_moose @alwaysonoffense "Freedom" does not include freedom to make everyone else pay for your health care.
@Joe35357 @alwaysonoffense you're to far left to realize to think on your own. Keep following the brainless uber liberal agenda.
@am_moose @alwaysonoffense I'm a doctor with a health policy degree. I don't get my news from Drudge.
