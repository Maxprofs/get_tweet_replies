@BarackObama @CultOfGood We need help.Who will help us? Anybody? #targetedindividuals #organizedstalking #communitywatchgroups #fusioncenter
@IGotYourNumber2 @BarackObama I honestly believe in todays time we can skip the bull and help ourselves,  we can trace signals to towers,
@CultOfGood @BarackObama Some of these towers are not even registered. How can that be @FCC ? We need to know who owns these #EMF #RF towers
@IGotYourNumber2 @BarackObama @FCC -- @FCC are morons, & the key isn't the towers, it's in the uplink and down link codes, if we cover
@IGotYourNumber2 @BarackObama @FCC everything and make a gird to catch these perps im sure we will, the earth is 80% water, and im sure the
@IGotYourNumber2 @BarackObama @FCC perps are just sitting inside somewhere in the 10% of the earth that is housed, it's no big deal, it be
@IGotYourNumber2 @BarackObama @FCC sweet if we can get some space drones, so I can follow the downlink straight to the satellite disturbin
@IGotYourNumber2 @BarackObama @FCC us & EMP it, 8) but before i'll tell my perps, 8) THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HELP WITH ELECTRONIC HARASSMENT~
@BarackObama 
JFK was irresponsibly foolish and dangerous to "National Security" in his Nuclear weapons talks with Russia.
@BigTimeFootball @BarackObama Oh really? He just saved the world from a nuclear conflict. No one knows history these days...
@LotonC @BarackObama 
With respect - 
there is History and the Real History
You only know high school history
@BigTimeFootball @BarackObama Apparently you only know football. My facts are straight here. Kennedy kept the missiles out of Cuba and war-
@BigTimeFootball @BarackObama from taking place with Russia. There is a transcript of the famous meeting. There is no debate.
@LotonC @BarackObama 
At what cost?
he lost the confidence of the Joint Chiefs and the Intel community.
He was moving too fast
@BigTimeFootball @BarackObama In the long term there was no cost. I guess you would have preferred Nuclear misses aimed at us from Cuba.
@LotonC @BarackObama 
JFK stumbled from crisis to crisis 
His assassination made his reputation what it is with people like you.
@BarackObama @CultOfGood President Kennedy also warned us about secret societies in our communities. #gangstalkers working behind the scenes
@BarackObama Thank you Mr. PRESIDENT! Words of wisdom!
@BarackObama  Republicans want another war, next will be WWIII Nuclear if there is another Republican President..
@BarackObama hello
@BarackObama stop tukish support for ISIS
@BarackObama Barak Obama Make His First Ad TV Watch It
@BarackObama Mr President, we live in a 21st Century World now. We need to adopt a 21st Century way of thinking.
@BarackObama Kennedy also in span of what six months allowed Russia to close off half of Berlin, backed away and that lead to cuban crisis.
@BarackObama conflict is inevitable but it doesn't have to be between humans. only working together can conflict with nature be resolved too
@BarackObama I don't see how people can bash you. You've done a great job as president. You haven't done anything to be disrespected.
@BarackObama exactly. My parents think war and hatred of this world is inevitable. It's not as long as you keep fighting for the peace.
@BarackObama See embarrassing situation faced by Barack Obama in Greece >>>
@BarackObama WISDOM LIKE  PRESIDENT
@BarackObama HONORED   KENNEDY VERY VERY  GRATE  WITH  VERY  SOFT HEART , PEOPLE  CAN  NOT  FORGET  HIM   BY NO MEANS,
@BarackObama how can u say that when ur the only country ever to use a nuclear weapon #hitlerquotingghandi
@BarackObama YOU HAVE FAILED MISERABLY http://beforeitsnews.com/politics/2015/08/seven-devastating-facts-about-obamas-iranian-deal-2732090.html …
@BarackObama #educate #america #Congress #reschedule #medicalmarijuana #cannabis patients in ALL states demand to have access to #cannabis
@BarackObama perhaps we should turn up diplomatic pressures until they cry Uncle. We gave a life life to foul regime. Jimmy Carter did too.
@BarackObama we are already in a conflict. We have an immediate beef as long as they have American hostages and Imams calling for throats.
@BarackObama anyone wonder Y Mrs. Obama left France and didn't join her husband in the Arab countries as other 1st ladies have...? #muslim
@BarackObama this is also what he said. He warned us of you!
@BarackObama #endtimes #irandeal
You are no Jack Kennedy, Obama.
@BarackObama. Yep !
@BarackObama mr obama ur  one of  wise president that I no
@BarackObama my sentiments exactly if more presidential candidates thought like PK America would be a better place!
@BarackObama savaş son gezegene sahip çıkma zamanı
@BarackObama JFK would be disgusted that u use his name & u try to associate with him!
#pimp
#UniteBlue
@BarackObama I'm still praying for you, believing the best! May God reward your service to this obstinate people!
@BarackObama @bannerite Thank you, president Obama.
@BarackObama But you are the one who says that conflict is inevitable if the #IranDeal is not signed. #twistthefacts #tomatchyourrhetoric
@BarackObama the difference is that Kennedy was willing to stand up. Study the Cuban missile crisis dumbass!!
@BarackObama wonderful
@BarackObama But you don't fully understand what that looks like and acting like the traitor you are only shows us that.
@BarackObama Don't quote Kennedy this is your deal. Worst president ever
@BarackObama :yes!
@BarackObama RIGHT YOU ARE SIR!!
@BarackObama PRESIDENT  KENNEDY  IS VERY  MEMORABLE  FOR EVER , TREMENDOUS  GOOD MORAL  VALUES  &  HIGHEST  GOOD QUALITIES  SEEN INSIDE HIM
@BarackObama @Th2shay oh oh that kind of thinking got Kennedy into deep trouble. With luck maybe Obama is trending towards US printing own $
@BarackObama #IranDeal is a poor deal not only for the #USA but also the world. We can't give Iran, a terrorist state, that type of control.
@BarackObama  president Kennedy was foolish. Rode in an open limousine now he is dead.  Wreck less  just like your Iran policy.
@BarackObama Kennedy put advisors into Vietnam....
@BarackObama @BarackObama mais le conflit il existe déjà et la fatalité aussi 
@BarackObama Wise words that I hope @IsraeliPM will learn sometimes !
@BarackObama an empty barrel makes more noise
@BarackObama  you are one of the best president
Seems it took 7 years for @BarackObama to understand that he too had a dream and not just a drone. #IranDeal
"President Kennedy warned Americans not to see conflict as inevitable. It is time to apply such wisdom.” —President Obama #IranDeal
@BarackObama you suck!
@BarackObama A natural harmony among states is simply not realistic. Conflict is inevitable when the national interest is in jeopardy. 2/2
@BarackObama presidente, domani è il 6_ agosto. Una data nefasta per il mondo, a cui dovreste chiedere scusa
@BarackObama but such wisdom is dangerous and consequential because it renders Americans naive to say the least. 1/2
@BarackObama President Kennedy was a moral man, you have no right to use his words.
@BarackObama Words of wisdom that Canadians should embrace #Timely #elxn42 #cdnpoli
What is inevitable is peace. All the rest is avoidable.  the war. The war E1 uncomfortable world. Seek peace. Barack Obama @BarackObama
@BarackObama we Americans are tired of war.
@BarackObama #educate #America #Congress #reschedule #medicalmarijuana #medicalcannabis ALL states deserve access not just a few@ky4mm
@BarackObama Ούτος εδίδαξεν της ειρήνης οδόν και καθάπερ αχλύν ή νέφος αποσκεδάσας την άνοιαν,λαμπράν ημίν της ειρήνης την γνώσιν απέφηνεν.
@BarackObama Sabias palabras! 
@BarackObama Democrats are wise statesmen who always stood for Peace; Woodrow Wilson to Barak Obama
@BarackObama What conflict was inevitable!? Sometimes the best action is no action. No "deal" HAD to be made!!!! #IranDeal
@BarackObama ....but it's my deal or war...
@BarackObama There is only one side of this relationship that wants war and it has sought it since 1979.  Sanctions are diplomatic relations
@BarackObama LOL, now u quote Kennedy, a Dem that U & your evil radical leftist gnomes would be castigating if he were on the scene today.
@BarackObama You have my blessings and if you must , go ahead and use your executive authority. God Bless America.
@BarackObama What color is the grass and sky in your make believe world? I've never seen such artful lieing by a so called "leader". Ur not!
@BarackObama Controlling nuclear power activities seems an huge and carefully long-lasting agenda for US and Iran's neighbourhood countries
@BarackObama I would agree — but with one exception. Russia.
Putin is a man of military muscle. You must show overpowering brawn to cow him.
@BarackObama Don't confuse cowardice and pacifism for wisdom! A nation who rules out force will be forced to defend themselves sooner.
@BarackObama #appliedONLY2HUMAN not #applicable4gOAtHAM ... #ToL ...
@BarackObama "If you are awaiting a finding of “clear and present danger,” then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear"
@BarackObama Obama to Israelis,trust me to defend Israel better then your Prime Minister,.Average Iranians just say Death to Israel for fun
@BarackObama Mr president. You are nice,loving, caring Father and husband. And has a smiling face. May God bless you, your family members
@BarackObama good deal,you open the doors for a big business with Iran and secondly you are going to sale a lot of wheapons to Saoudia Araby
@BarackObama and in the same time you have killed a competitor: France with Mistral boats. Well done
@BarackObama President Washington said to not get Involved in others conflicts
@BarackObama  yes
Peace
For humanity
Achievements
@barackobama that so verry good
This statement conflicts, @BarackObama with "Alternative to this deal is some form of war." no? #DoubleSpeak
@BarackObama  nice ...
@BarackObama he hasn't even signed for chelsea yet
When the debt industry has a monopoly on the currency, conflict entrepreneurialism will always tip the balance in favor of war @BarackObama
