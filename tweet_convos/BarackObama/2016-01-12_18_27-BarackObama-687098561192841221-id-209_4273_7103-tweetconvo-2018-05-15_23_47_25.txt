@BarackObama well maybe professors should work for less
@BarackObama why can't you have another term man.
@zustinsxo @BarackObama because that would be dangerous and against the law!
@sandynicoll1046 @BarackObama did i ask u
@zustinsxo @BarackObama your on twitter. I dont have to ask!
@sandynicoll1046 @BarackObama ...
@BarackObama Agreed....but what about the people that have graduated and are struggling to pay off their loans?
@BarackObama love you pressy
@loverir4eva @BarackObama he is a self absorbed socialist with a soft spot for radical islam
@sandynicoll1046 @loverir4eva @BarackObama yea, & you are a cunt !
@parvezakhtarbd @loverir4eva @BarackObama that is harsh. You are An immature brat
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama apparently @SpeakerRyan disagrees with everything you said.  He also hates freedom,  babies & puppies too.
@Jillymoe @BarackObama @SpeakerRyan true
@BarackObama thank you
@BarackObama how about doctors getting free college to lower healthcare cost
@BarackObama Republicans say we are nation of haves and soon to have, but the most reliable way to make a good living is to go to college!!!
@BarackObama so true. When i get through with Nursing school i will owe a ton of money lol
@BarackObama 挺好的。
@BarackObama  you got that right @BarackObama  preach
@BarackObama I totally agree, I see universities spending huge amounts on sports and other things. If these spending needs cutdown
@BarackObama
@BarackObama keep making student money cheap and you see tuition rates rise- basic economics
@BarackObama Most students can't afford to pay college loans and cost of living. http://wsbankruptcylaw.com/college-graduate-estimator/ …
@BarackObama Amen!
@BarackObama I agree, students should not pile up a mountain of debt.
@BarackObama Amen to that!
@BarackObama yes my daughter is in college I need help with money. I need to pay $5000 by 1/25 for her to register for new semester. HELP
@BarackObama My 4 yr BSME total cost tuition books fees board $10000. CPI change from 70 is 6X. Todays cost should be $60000 not $120000. ??
@BarackObama Student loans are the cause of high college cost. It's inflationary. Too much money chasing too few goods.
@BarackObama ok......you've been mentioning this FOREVER.... Now please please make something happen. I have an estimate of $200,000 loans
Snap your fingers I think that helps the loans go away
@BarackObama I thank God I lived to see The Dream begin to manifest. Youth is the future. It is bleek. It will take lots of love n comitment
@BarackObama مدينة حسي بحبح
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama ...Like.....USA.....EU EVROPA.....Prague....2016...
@BarackObama Maybe you can remind Aus PM Turnbull of that while he's in Washington.
@BarackObama Amen
@BarackObama INTERST RATES TOO HIGH..WE NEED PROGRAM FOR FREE HIGHER EDUCATION IF YOU MAKE THE GRADE #feelthebern
@BarackObama and for 7 years, again, you've done nothing about it. #Shocking. We do have overpriced shitty forced healthcare though! Yay!
@BarackObama Sir, universally education should be made free, merit based; I mean money & education is the most ridiculous of juxtapositions.
@BarackObama that's real ture

@BarackObama 新的教育法案？
@BarackObama Oscar López Rivera deserves Freedom. It would be an unforgettable lesson of mercy and rights, above all, for freedom fighters.
@BarackObama Thank you.
@BarackObama I support the idea for low and don't forget middle income students.
@BarackObama Its true Sir
@BarackObama what can we do about it
@BarackObama Yep. Hey students don't go where you can't afford or take your time and work to earn it. #problemsolved

@BarackObama  you are correct, but how do we pay for it Bernie?
@BarackObama Thank you Mr President.
@ewalsh517 @BarackObama this right here is why I never completed my degree!
@BarackObama Thank You and @SenWarren for reiterating this. Now let's actually change it! #POTUS #ElizabethWarren
@BarackObama  maybe professors make to much money
@BarackObama at the same time work manship with practically work. In addition, that education means not job but for self development field.
@BarackObama @MarquesGax graduates should be able to find a job too. Use govt magic and legislate us all rich. #Derp
@BarackObama Sir, thank you, continue your campaign on higher education!
@BarackObama I attended a 4 year institute, had over half of my educations paid for in scholarships and still came out with $86,000 in loans
@BarackObama vous au moin vous travailler dur pour l'avenir professionnelle des étudiants américains
@BarackObama vous du moin vous comprener les souhaits de votre peuple et travailler pour qu,il puisse atteindre leur aspiration
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama so why is it that 53% of college grads are out of work?  Do we really need more grads?
@BarackObama Or without their parents doing the same. #14moretuitionpayments
@BarackObama so tell your buddies in the union & admin's to take pay cuts and lower costs
@BarackObama sir, thanks for your dedication and your words of inspiration
@BarackObama obama is a honest brave wise sympathetic president of use we love you due to your good working for the world thanks
@BarackObama I agree... Scam that it should work that way; to raise a nation of great wisdom intellect must be upheld.
@BarackObama My husband and I, first generation college grads, want nothing more than to get rid of our #studentloandebt
@BarackObama We are PRAYING and PREPARING for our children so they can experience a better life post higher education... #studentloandebt
@BarackObama I can't afford to even pay my student loan every month...a choice between eating & paying this loan!!
@BarackObama 
Who is going to pay for it? I can't afford to support anymore people u give handouts to.
@BarackObama soooo do something about it....?
@BarackObama Yea. This should be given to graduate students who also want to further their career. We should be rewarding them.
@BarackObama Better than a 100 nice words is one good action for instance closing #Gitmo
@BarackObama Four more years...please!
@BarackObama Atta boy, Mr. President!  A gentlement and hero. @POTUS
@BarackObama Amen
@BarackObama VIVA MY PRESIDENT
@BarackObama Not 1 GOP member stood up. Do they believe that only their spoiled, entitled kids should have that opportunity?
@BarackObama @francislblackg2 and good for the poor, you know what that means there is no way for anything positive
@BarackObama Amen! When are we going to start taxing these billion dollar "not for profit"univ endowments that charge $180k per 4 yr degree?
@BarackObama That's the dream...
@BarackObama Like STALIN did in Russia - then when u graduate u make the same as the street cleaners
"@BarackObama: Students should be able to get an education without taking on decades' worth of student loan debt. #SOTU SA too #feesmustfall
@BarackObama true true education should not be valued by money
@BarackObama True that.
@BarackObama Very good, happy too you. I like you mister président.
@BarackObama who is paying for the tuition then? Where is the money coming from? #UNDPSPA
@BarackObama Mr President we need your help. I graduated w/ a nursing degree 5 yes ago & still paying for my school loans
.@BarackObama is that Y fed loan int rates 4 grad school R astronomical? Y SecEd is "closing loophole" by making married couples pay more?
@BarackObama#EraseStudentDebt
@BarackObama yes we (America) is strong. !!!!
@BarackObama How is that going to help when #TPP destroys American jobs? #collegeopportunity
@BarackObama  I need a help for my study.
@BarackObama so make colleges stop overcharging
@BarackObama To have jobs available that match what a student. is studying for. And take funds away if they are not able to do so.
@BarackObama I wasnt able to even get that far in college. Never could get financial aid, and no one in school could help.
@BarackObama President Obama should reexam the financial aid system and put rules in place to hold more colleges and Universities.
@BarackObama @brookeyerger6 the one thing he has said that I might agree with
@BarackObama college was cheap before the government got involved, why would we want the government more involved?
@BarackObama what about existing student loan debt?  #help #studentloans #forgive
@BarackObama also why you should reform K-12 to be useful for something other than going to college, so colleges have to compete
@BarackObama which is why the government shouldn't drive up tuition cost by creating artificial demand.
@BarackObama #socialism is not US
@BarackObama so why, in your 8 years of presidency have you NOT developed a plan to make tuition affordable?!?!?! 
@BarackObama story of my life!
@BarackObama so what can we do to get rid of all the debt encompassed during our time in school so we don't have to get off to a false start
@BarackObama make student loan interest fully tax deductible w/o income limitations. Let students pay their way w/o making a profit
@BarackObama Who pays for this?
@BarackObama And the parents too. Parent Plus Loans suck too. @POTUS @FLOTUS
@The2boysmom @BarackObama @POTUS @FLOTUS maybe liberal college professors get paid to much
@BarackObama Your speech is very engaging!  That Ryan guy looks so stoic! Unbelievable! Potus u did a great job as my President!
@BarackObama Am impressed I like the bottom up approach
@BarackObama Singing Handel's Messiah, "Hallelujah". Text book companies get over 2. students on Financial Aid & work study cannot afford!
@BarackObama @Hardeyaddra #good thesis but no solution
@MaryShults @BarackObama Republican are unhappy ppl. If Jesus was @ #SOTU, betcha, GOP will nailed him down with criticism. #GOPUnhappy
@BarackObama @EugeneResnick but we also want to incentivize high quality professors and institutions.  Everyone wants their cake & to eat it

@BarackObama my life. The loans are ridiculous because the wage hasn't been updated for us law librarians!
@BarackObama awesome!! Your speech is great. U are the greatest president ever
@BarackObama They can -- by going into #trades. Please don't perpetuate the idea that #college is the only/best road to an #education. :(

@BarackObama HOW ARE U TWEETIN
@BarackObama THANKS FOR BEING A AWESOME PRESIDENT
@BarackObama: Students should be able to get an education without taking on decades' worth of student loan debt. THIS THIS THIS
@gjohnson1989 @BarackObama so who pays for college again?
@politicaltruth8 @barackobama The country that is relying on the newest generation to make strides. Me, you, everyone.
@politicaltruth8 @barackobama also, affordable education doesn't mean free. No education should cost 250k.
@gjohnson1989 @BarackObama how much should it cost? The amount of a car loan???
@politicaltruth8 @barackobama i can't speak to prices, but do you think any education is worth 200k+? I don't. But education is necessary.
@gjohnson1989 @BarackObama financial aid pays for those who can't. Loans pay for those who don't meet aid.
@politicaltruth8 @barackobama got to pay back those loans, how long will it take to pay back over 200k in loans? Forever.
