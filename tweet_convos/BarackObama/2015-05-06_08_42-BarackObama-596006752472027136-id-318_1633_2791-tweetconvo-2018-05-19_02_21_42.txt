@Truth_Does_Hurt The truth is that WE all pay if our citizens are under-educated.
@_CJMinOREGON Most are under-educated now and have been for years. Free CC would just extend high school laziness and increase taxes.
@_CJMinOREGON $$ needed to pay for this 'free' CC wouldn't come from unicorn farts, pixie dust or leprechauns... TAXPAYERS will pay it.
@VP @BarackObama 4 whom is it free? Tax payers must pay for everything?  How about the senators Can u spell Pelosi? http://www.rollcall.com/.../the-50-richest-members-of-congress-112th-2012.html …
@VP No. It shouldnt. Your reasoning could be a case for any and all things being free. YK
@YULANDAJONES @VP No it doesn't!!! The GI Bill (free education) following WWII lead to the greatest boom in US history.
@_CJMinOREGON @YULANDAJONES @VP 
You think the G.I. Bill was free!?!
Do U know how many soldiers(while on active duty)are on food stamps?
@_CJMinOREGON @YULANDAJONES @VP 
college, goes to work,-what they would pay in taxes ea year-pays school debt-until school debt is paid off.
@Faithgirlee @_CJMinOREGON @VP The problem with that is then, all the other things taxes are (cont) http://tl.gd/njmf41 
@VP Yea! Everything should be free! #collegein5words

@VP God bless America. God bless you. Keep doing Gods work.
@VP @BarackObama nothing is free. Why can't those going to college pay for their own indoctrination? I do not want to pay for it.
@VP @BarackObama I know why. It is because they can not pay their student loan when there are few jobs in your Crappy economy you ass.

@VP @BarackObama Vice President Biden
Since taking office I have not heard him
Well it's okay HahhahahahaHahhahahaha
@VP I disagree. Comm college is cheap already (I made it free via scholarships/job). We'd be charging extra taxes to who go to 4 yr colleges
@VP @BarackObama 
training has always been a part of our peace.
@VP ALL EDUCATION TO EVERY HUMAN MUST BE FREE . YOU ARE DOING A GREAT WORK FOR THE HUMAN RACE .
@VP well. I had to pay for it., myself. So.

@VP @BarackObama everything should be free but it doesn't work that way
@VP Also, with hard work & good grades in school there are scholarships. College is free for those who work for it. @BarackObama
@VP Nothing is free, someone pays for it. I assume since you feel it should be, you are volunteering to pick up the bill? @BarackObama

@VP @BarackObama They also need general ed classes: astronomy, painting, accounting…community colleges shouldn't just be technical schools.
@VP @HolleSharon Who's going to pay the teachers?
@VP I agree #freeCC!!! God Bless America

@VP @BarackObama It is free. In Finland i mean  ;)
@VP @BarackObama it is burdensome when you yearn to do more but lack the funds to improve your resume with a college degree. You stay stuck.
@VP @BarackObama free community college would make it so much easier 4 those of us who are capable/able workers w/ little expendable income.
@VP @BarackObama Should be and ever happening in this life-time are two different things...
@VP #Absolutely Right On Mr. Vice President Joe Biden.

@BarackObama @VP college students should get bailout from student loans like the BIG 3 and Wall Street
@VP just saying "make it free" doesn't make it senseable. 4 more years of highschool if the discussion ends at finance
@VP @BarackObama "Free" community college? TANSTAAFL, idiots.
@VP @BarackObama indeed! That would be awesome!
@VP @BarackObama Is Educational Education important
