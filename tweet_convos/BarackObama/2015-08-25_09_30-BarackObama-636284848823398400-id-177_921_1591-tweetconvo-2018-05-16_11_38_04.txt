The Obama Administration made "Clean Energy" dirty. Also pushed down coal companies, Soros is buying them up cheap @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@81I2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Coal is poison. Dirty air. Must move away from coal and oil. If you like to breathe.
Switching ownership of coal to help Obama's string pullers isn't stopping the use of coal at all. @LotonC @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@81I2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Of course not. Big business doesn't care about the planet or people's health. We need to ban coal and oil.
Obama, more his backers do not want to phase out fossil fuels, they use it as a political football for leverage. @LotonC @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@81I2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Rich people shit on the planet and destroy it because they do not care about future generations, pure evil.
Some people do shitty things and look the other way for quick gain. People like Obama & his group fuck society purposely @LotonC @WhiteHouse
@81I2 @WhiteHouse Nixon, Reagan, Both Bushes were what u say about Obama. You are wrong about everything. Tiny IQ.
"Clean Energy" was used as pretext. To pay back contributors through scams, for no benefit to us, as well as GE & China. @WhiteHouse @POTUS
Obama Administration could care less about clean energy, it's about a big buiz $ grab & gov power grab @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@GreenLiberation @WhiteHouse @POTUS Obama's 2nd inaugural speech was all about climate change!

@GrndLkNatv @WhiteHouse @braintwat @POTUS No. The sun does not burn gas. It splits hydrogen releasing energy and creating helium and expand
@ya_mclaughlin @GrndLkNatv @WhiteHouse @POTUS ~Gravitational compressive ignition of hydrogen, then converts to helium? Is my understanding
@GrndLkNatv @ya_mclaughlin @WhiteHouse @POTUS ~Yes,a state.I question,what state in the extreme core environment before conversion to helium
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS VERY EXCELLENT THINKING.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS arctic shell drilling, Monsanto, franking.. If u really care, stop talking & start doing. Pure rhetoric. 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Right..You can do anything and nothing sometimes.. Like İn Syria.Anything to stop ISIS, nothing to stop ASAD
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hope will become reality if P&P investments will go along together and new rules will be quickly adopted
