@FactsOnClimate clean energy is unpredictably variable power energy, very exposed to natural disasters. Won't do for industry. @WhiteHouse
@snbbloopers @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse And you think our other power sources aren't just as exposed?
@boogercatch when source is the nature you're even more exposed than if you were IN the nature. Need base power @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse
@snbbloopers @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse lol what?
@boogercatch can't do that within the tw limit, friend. Try some published papers on demand stats. @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse
@snbbloopers @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse I'm still trying to grasp how that's relevant in regards to your first comment.
@boogercatch unreliability of a base power provision level. @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse
@snbbloopers @FactsOnClimate @WhiteHouse but how?  Unless there's a nuclear holocaust on the rise, solar power isn't going anywhere soon.
