@BarackObama , the increase is good for Incarceration, Inc. These is too much privatization of custodial facilities. More folks, more money.
@BarackObama the system incarcerates people and punish twice after served time they mark for life meaning bleak employment future .
@BarackObama employees should not discriminate against those with a f or m charge yet that's what they do.
@BarackObama Well but all you criminals in government in prison and have someone honest get back to us on those numbers.
@BarackObama That's not the only thing suffering from liberal stupidity and political correctness.  Don't worry we don't expect u to fix it.
@BarackObama it's the freaking failed drug war and huge problem of pols and police corruption.
@BarackObama  your nice

@BarackObama while you were president moron . Our country is worse than ever . by the way we are still Christian nation
@BarackObama This is what happens when we privatize prisons.  Social services should never be subject to capitalism.
@BarackObama think about it...
@BarackObama because the country has more African Americans and Latinos
@BarackObama does these numbers show you how much you have failed the people with your lies ?
@BarackObama  until the prison industrial complex is shut down and no longer on the NYSE expect gov. to continue creating the product needed
@BarackObama It's a profitable industry. We can stop it, but it goes against our national religion, capitalism.
@BarackObama ;)))
@BarackObama 
Mr. plenty of public freedoms and interest money generates crime
.@BarackObama why you gotta plagiarize quotes from @systemofadown 

@jjph4412
@BarackObama Lets turn the "for profit" prisons into mental health facilities with decent services for this under-served population.
@BarackObama And THANK YOU for the great work during your presidency!
@BarackObama @blvarga the fact that prison business sold/traded on stock market hurts.Sadly more time for drug dealers than child molesters
@BarackObama Minor crimes would be study in programs.force by a judge to take a degree. Like a punishment.
@BarackObama @tanyaj6777 this should not be our focus. #Educate cause #rehabilate is no longer a part of the #prison process.
@BarackObama really
@BarackObama  Donald Trump needs a wheelbarrow to get around his balls are so big. You go man, just what this Country needs!

@BarackObama yes, #prison industrial complex lobbies #Congress hard for those results #MoneyInPolitics #BlackLivesMatter
@BarackObama le pido el favor de no dejar libre a Simón trinidad .
@BarackObama policing for profit court system for profit =prison's for profit
@BarackObama spend the money that goes to lock up non-violent drug offenders on mental health & rehab #Fairness #logic
@BarackObama it's what happens will you remove morals from a country
@godlyencounter @BarackObama it's what happens when you make minor drug offenses worth prison time and criminalize addicts (sick people)
@godlyencounter @BarackObama if that's what you meant by immoral then yeah it IS immoral to criminalize the sick, or the recreational user
@SuperSpacedad @godlyencounter @BarackObama Well, where wld you like those violent people with MH issues to go? Walking the streets?
@barbszoo22 @godlyencounter @BarackObama people with mental illness are more likely to be victims of crime & less likely to be perps
@barbszoo22 @godlyencounter @BarackObama the fact that you think mental health issues means people need prison time is part of the problem
@barbszoo22 @godlyencounter @BarackObama we *do* force many mentally ill to become vagrants in this country. So they criminalize vagrancy
@barbszoo22 @godlyencounter @BarackObama just more beating up on and scapegoating sick people as criminals. Welcome to America.
@BarackObama women in American support you Obama! You go!
@BarackObama #LegalizeMarijuana and it will drop by at least 30%
@BarackObama Look to Norway! See how they treat their prisoners. Focus on building up - not breaking down.

@BarackObama @SenToomey @SenBobCasey #BantheBox
@BarackObama A  justice system is for punishment or  social rehabilitation !
all those non violent criminals in there 

RT @BarackObama "Our prison population has doubled in the last two decades alone"—President Obama
@BarackObama that statement is correct.Its crazy how media has an individual hated,he has never did anything but help his country.
@BarackObama there's a need for mentorship in the category of helping people coming out of prison with guidance and insight upon release.

@BarackObama Honestly, do you ONLY care about black people and no other Americans? Have a heart and say a single word about Kate Steinle!
