Hello @conniebritton @WhiteHouse @HealthCareGov How much were you paid for this endorsement?
@conniebritton Because only 37% approve, the other 63% are, of course, stupid Americans, right? http://www.gallup.com/poll/179426/new-enrollment-period-starts-aca-approval.aspx …
@conniebritton @liztigelaar @HealthCareGov yup I have 2 health cares,  they've now made it illegal for me to be treated outside the state :(
@conniebritton @HealthCareGov hell no the ACA is crap like your failed presidency @BarackObama
@conniebritton @HealthCareGov just another shift of wealth from the rich corporations that use to pay the bill and now YOU do dumb ass
@conniebritton @HealthCareGov they just can't get away from the heavy hands of greed!
