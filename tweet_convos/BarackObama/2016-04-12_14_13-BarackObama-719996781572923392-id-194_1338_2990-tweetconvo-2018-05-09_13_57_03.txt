@BarackObama @business This is doable by removing tax breaks, and increasing income tax rates on the wealthy.
@BarackObama @business How does a myth increase GDP?
@BarackObama BS! Corps will just lower mens salaries! How can you prove salary difference when there are so many factors involved?!
@BarackObama guess it's not women and children first anymore.
@BarackObama Obama is @@$$!! CRAZY !
@BarackObama Gender equality already exists. Only the foolish have been brainwashed to think otherwise
@BarackObama Yeah and I suppose that more government spending would increase GDP too, huh. 
Sorry pal. 
Both defy logic.
@BarackObama respecting women, not deliberately insulting them is vry imp for progress n peace
