.@BarackObama I beg your pardon. In the USA, every child has the RIGHT to access a world class education. Every. single. child. Regardless.
If every child has a right, then who is to provide for said right? @ellastractia @BarackObama
@Katrina_Lexxa @BarackObama Exactly. As a teacher, my power to do so was stripped away bit by bit year by year until hope became futile.
But who will provide for said right? The child? The parent(s)? 
@ellastractia @BarackObama
@Katrina_Lexxa @BarackObama In the US Constitution, it is the responsibility of the state, the government to provide. A right. All children.
Please cite the section and article within the US Constitution which defines education as a right. @ellastractia @BarackObama
@Katrina_Lexxa @BarackObama No Child Left Behind gave more power to the Federal Government in terms of Education - George Bush was pres then
That is legislation, statute, public law, CFR...NOT the US Constitution. @ellastractia @BarackObama
.@BarackObama Not "a shot at" a world class education, "the right" to access a world class education. Unless you plan to do some rewriting.
@ellastractia @BarackObama. Hi nick today tipy I am your name  ellastractia okay easily tjank

@BarackObama True the Department of Education should be scrapped. That would be a good place to start.  Private education is the way to go.
