@BarackObama @Alasscan_ And it's still barely $20,000 a year.  Enough to feed and cloth a family?  Pay rent?  Who are we kidding?
@Alasscan_ @BarackObama And yet, in many states it's the middle class and the poor that support the Republicans.  Baffling.
@Alasscan_ @BarackObama Republican motto: Keeping them undereducated and poor and they'll believe anything.  See: Orwell's Animal Farm
