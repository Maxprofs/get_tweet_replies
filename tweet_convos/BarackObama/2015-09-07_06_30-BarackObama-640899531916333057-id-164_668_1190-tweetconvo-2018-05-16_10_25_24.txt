@The2boysmom @WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS He can't make private employers give you sick leave.
@MzBlackMamba @WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Sad, people go to work sick, get others sick just to make ends meet..vicious circle...

@WhiteHouse @POTUS While he fires US workers and replaces them with temporary visa holders
@wallybeaver2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS presidents can do that? I mean POTUS and not presidents of companies? Can you refer to an article of this?
@mwilliams4555 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Glad u asked. Southren caledison replaced its wrkrs. With H1B1visa holders. The US GOVT issues those visas
@wallybeaver2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS but it was the company that replaced the workers. you're saying that's the govt fault when it was the co.?
@mwilliams4555 @WhiteHouse @POTUS understand who authorized the visas
@wallybeaver2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS that is literally like saying it is the gun seller's fault for selling a gun to someone. Seriously
@mwilliams4555 @wallybeaver2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Yup! Bang bang govt allows non citizens to replace US born workers....treason!
@razw @wallybeaver2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS then you should boycott the company that did that I'm not sure how the govt is at fault here

@WhiteHouse @POTUS paying people to fake sickness how very liberal of you.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Work needs sacrifices
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama its a good plan
@WhiteHouse @POTUS With all that's  needed, I could accept anything our President of the United  States offers.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  it's really
@WhiteHouse thanks so much for sharing. Just added it here: https://www.rebelmouse.com/ozaetagroup/  http://rbl.ms/1knli8o 
@WhiteHouse @POTUS: is he paying for it too. Tax cuts to the rich? Who defines the rich? 400,000 in NYC or DC is diff. Then Nebraska.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Is it one help me financially I am a refugee in a camp in Jordan! ??
@WhiteHouse @SEIU @POTUS None of that will endure as long as the 2011 worst SCOTUS decision that corporations have more $, so more rights.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Another over reach and abuse of the office. Congress did not Clear it @HCimprimis
@WhiteHouse @POTUS why don't you work on getting 300,000 ppl off welfare instead of more spending on government employees who don't work??
@WhiteHouse @POTUS G.O.P WILL SAY TOO BIG GOV. AS USUAL SAME THINK SOCIAL'S ACTIONS ARE < COMMUNISM >
@WhiteHouse @vj44 why should Federal workers have better benefits than American workers? Balance your budget first
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Why are we in 2015 and celebrating this? It's something that should be a given for ALL Americans! Thank you, POTUS!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @cnnbrk @foxnewspolitics @SpeakerBoehner

@WhiteHouse @POTUS Why are some Americans so hostile towards workers rights?
@MikeBarrow3 @WhiteHouse @POTUS because brainwashing and making things up from elected officials :(
