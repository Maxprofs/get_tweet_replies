@vidallerenas @BarackObama He visto como el matrimonio gay pasó de ser un tema utilizado para separarnos a una historia de la libertad."
@valvirgen @BarackObama es verdad lo traduje rápido y mal
@vidallerenas @BarackObama Ojalá en todo #mexico se apliquen leyes progresistas de igualdad de género y de paso legalicen la #marihuana ;)
@valvirgen es interesante como en USA tanto legalización de mariguana como matrimonio igualitario son apoyados p la mayoría
@vidallerenas Y más interesante es ver lo que ha pasado después de la legalización y aplicación de esas leyes!
