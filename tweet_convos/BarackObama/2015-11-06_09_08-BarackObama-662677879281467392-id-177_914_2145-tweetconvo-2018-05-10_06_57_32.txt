@BarackObama so why haven't the prices of petroleum products and petroleum driven products gone down proportionally? Such as airlines,
@BarackObama @lynrouse1 I thought low gas prices were bad because it enables more people to pollute.  What did I miss?
@BarackObama https://wikipedisrael.org/wiki/Vague_de_terrorisme_palestinien_de_2015 …
@BarackObama in Greenville SC we paid 1.89 per gas.
@GOP: "It's President Obama's fault that gas prices have plummeted to all-time low since he took office." @POTUS @BarackObama
@BarackObama I wish African leaders can also demonstrate astute leadership in power
@BarackObama why can't that be all gas stations though all across America @divasantamonica

@BarackObama united nation is silent for biafrans killing everyday
@BarackObama this isn't about now. It was just a short time ago this wasn't the case and it will be again. Iran is a good deal? This isn't?
@barackobama @wessmith123 At least you still measure in gallons.In the UK Gasoline is around $9.00 a gallon..imagine that in US
@BarackObama Let's get it under $1, and not by invading Iraq, Libya, & Syria under false pretenses, please!

@BarackObama not thanks to you! Other forces are at play , but an impostor always glorify himself!!
@BarackObama yes I should drive all over looking for $2/gal fuel. About as smart as denying the XL pipeline. #shameonyou
@BarackObama while surrounding towns maintain low prices. 2/2
@BarackObama We occasionally get it at that price, but one man in town controls prices here and it'll jump 40 cents in a matter of hrs 1/2
@BarackObama  it's called drill baby drill
@BarackObama Because your "slow"...  IT'S ABOUT JOOOBBBSSS...... I guess a great divider really doesn't care. Doesn't involve race!!
@BarackObama So your saying the sky is blue and therefore, OJ is innocent.  That's what your explanation sounds like.......
@BarackObama And all residents of the state should drive to this gas station to fill. Great mathematical insight.
@BarackObama  can we make that possible in California as well

@BarackObama Also, ALL states can easily find illegals looking for work at those same gas stations. #HablaThat

@BarackObama sorry mr presadant gas would'nt be lnestad of petrol
@BarackObama NO thanks to you, but to the ingenuity of US co's who figured how to extract more crude from shales which brought prices down!

@BarackObama that would be great if i lived in one of those states. Get all 50 states to that point then pat yourself on the back.
@BarackObama Those post Katrina prices were bs! This price is in line with what it would cost now sans the event

@BarackObama @POTUS  Mr President is the MAN! Keeping the money in our country! My hat is off to Mr President!
@BarackObama and that has nothing to do with you, or the rejection of a pipeline that is already flowing with oil. Get real skippy!
@BarackObama Not NY
@BarackObama we still need wage reform or mandatory profit sharing; especially factory jobs who require mandatory overtime
@BarackObama Thanks Boss.
@BarackObama and it would be even cheaper if you would not be an idiot and drill into the pipeline
@BarackObama why not all 50 states.#onecountryoneprice
