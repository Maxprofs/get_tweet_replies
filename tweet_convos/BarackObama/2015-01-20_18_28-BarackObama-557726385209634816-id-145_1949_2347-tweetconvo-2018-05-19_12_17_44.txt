@BarackObama want to marry with me,and must seperate me and him.which is your thought,I want the truth.please tell me your true thought from
“@BarackObama: "This country does best when everyone gets their fair shot." —President Obama #SOTU” debateable
@lydiebird98 @BarackObama there are people that shouldn't get a "fair shot"?
@sofsofsofsofsof what's debatable is not that everyone should get a fair shot but rather if everyone truly is more successful in the end
@lydiebird98 I don't see how that means we shouldn't foster equality of opportunity
@sofsofsofsofsof = opportunity doesn't mean = outcome; although we give everyone fair chances, the nation isn't guaranteed success
@lydiebird98 I agree, but we should at least try. What bad can come from equal opportunity?
@lydiebird98 he's saying that this country will be the best place for all its citizens when they aren't restricted by factors they can't
@lydiebird98 control
“@BarackObama: "This country does best when everyone gets their fair shot." —President Obama #SOTU” so do a lot of things
@BarackObama Noted.  Looking for that opportunity. Attained M.A. in educatoon. No job to date.  Please help. Thanks!
