@BarackObama  Patients, you don't know it  what s Doctors, Insurens and Pharmaindustries make
@BarackObama Minister Daniel Bahr is not a good advisor. A health insurance company must be transparent patients data for all peoples.
@BarackObama I do. But Massachusetts is ruined now. It had Romney Care before and is in debt now because of the money spent on computer mess
@BarackObama seriously? You're a mental case
@BarackObama Medicare Advantage programs pay less than the seniors co-pay for many drugs. Is the legal?
@BarackObama Medicare Advantage programs restrict seniors to a tight network. Is that legal?
@BarackObama 
Sir u r the architect of health insurance for all usa citizens. Really great
@BarackObama The way Ebola cases are handled we are going to need it, whether we want it or not, no choice when lives are at stake, right?
@BarackObama no
@BarackObama Medicare Advantage policies are not meeting the criteria of the law i.e. provide as a minimum what Original Medicare does.
@BarackObama Medicare is failing seniors by being too cozy with insurance companies.and helping to confuse them with too many choices.
@BarackObama while your spread #Ebola @BarackObama refusal to stop travel into USA by citizens of plague nations is an assault on US citizen
