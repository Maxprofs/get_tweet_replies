@BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl what's wrong with u 2 and that "my people" shit. We are all people.. we are all "our people". Sad.
@Piensing @BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl I agree to a certain extent.. We are all people but not the same people.
@CrownOfThorns6 @BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl of course we are not the same. That would be boring ;). Differences should unite us.
@Piensing @BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl That should unite us but this is a society that judges you if you're different.
@CrownOfThorns6 @BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl guess being so focused on urselves, USA ppl lose perspective.migrating opens ur mind
@Piensing @BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl I don't think I'm focusing on myself. I am, however, focused on problems many face here.
@CrownOfThorns6 @BarackObama @Naco_Nation @62jerseygirl nt denying that.but u would give it a better focus if u spent some time abroad.
@BarackObama I think you're a great president and mean well.. But isn't this post a little irresponsible and insensitive.. 400YearsFreeLabor

@BarackObama agreed
.@BarackObama @madgelagoy Great point President Obama. We do forget our earliest history on this continent. Huge sacrifices by nonwhites.
.@BarackObama @madgelagoy As teen I focused on reading history of slavery, its historical & legal antecedents & its psychology in conflicts.
@BarackObama 니거
No, @BarackObama. It's the Constitution & rule of law that made the USA special. Many immigrants fled corrupt governments & tinpot dictators
@BarackObama You left out "Legal". Legal immigrants, sir. Like you. Well, I mean, like Michelle, maybe. Or that one aunt of yours. Anyone?
@BarackObama Legal immigrants pre-Teddy Kennedy's move to ensure all future immigrants are third world goat herders, beholden to dims.
@BarackObama they did not break the law to get here
@BarackObama  WHO is using you to tear down America? Cuz I rly don't believe u r talented or ambitious enuff to think YOU can do it yourself
@BarackObama  yes, and those that count toward that contribution came here thru LEGAL avenues! WTH is your deal,anyway?!?Whose patsy ARE u??

@BarackObama Something your not!
@BarackObama decades of immigrants also have brought drugs, weapons, and gang violence in our country too.
@BarackObama I doff my hat to you sir, a bold decision. For those immigrants there is light at the end of the tunnel!
@BarackObama yes sir. we are the greatest nation. USA
@BarackObama You're absolutely right - LEGAL immigration, not sneaking over the border.
@BarackObama Its time to stop the flow of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, SOMETHING must be DONE ABOUT OUR BORDERS BEING OPEN!  TERRORISM IS REAL.
@BarackObama we have laws for immigrants to LEGALLY become citizens!  You would think the president would know the law... O wait ...
@BarackObama wow
@BarackObama Yes but you left me out of DACA.  I came here at 16 and have paid taxes for 19 years.
@BarackObama At long last, someone in the High Office has the guts to spell it out! Good Luck, Mr Obama.
@BarackObama That is America lead the pack.
