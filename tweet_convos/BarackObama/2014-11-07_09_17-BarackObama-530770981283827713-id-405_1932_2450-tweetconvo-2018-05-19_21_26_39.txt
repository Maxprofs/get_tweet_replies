@Charles_S_Viar @BarackObama @srjones66 Unemployment rate falling only because govt not counting people whose benefits have run out.
@BarackObama If you add back in the tens of millions that have given up and stopped looking for work, what does that bring the rate too?
@YEEHAWDIST @BarackObama 
Democrats do not want Americans 2 consider those people. Of course Dems will count them when we have a Rep. pres

@BarackObama Its virtually impossible for welfare to be a record highs and unemployment to drop. Thats It its physically impossible
@BarackObama Is this perhaps because people have been unemployed for so long they are now ineligible to receive unemployment? No new jobs.

Wat RT: “@BarackObama: The unemployment rate is falling as fast as any point in the last 30 years. Let's keep building that momentum.”
This is easily one of the top 10 hilariously stupid yet dead serious tweets I've seen.
Normally he'd probably fire who ever is in charge of his economic tweet ideas, but he probably doesn't want to slow this "record" momentum.
@BarackObama
.@BarackObama need I remind you...
@BarackObama Yo Barack dude ,invest in creating entrepreneurs from small to medium and watch them create Millions of jobs no shit dude
@BarackObama: The president has spoken love it..
@BarackObama @kharyp The irony is the TP/GOP is, and will continue, claiming credit for it, when we went into a Great Depression under them.
