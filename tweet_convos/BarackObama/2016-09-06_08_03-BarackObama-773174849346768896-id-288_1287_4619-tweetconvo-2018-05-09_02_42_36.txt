Climate change has been a natural earth process for billions of years without the help of humans or CO2. #StopScammingAmerica
EPA shills of the administration scammed America with their CO2 endangerment findings. #StopScammingAmerica
CO2 impact on climate is radical political and environmental activism, not science. #StopScammingAmerica
