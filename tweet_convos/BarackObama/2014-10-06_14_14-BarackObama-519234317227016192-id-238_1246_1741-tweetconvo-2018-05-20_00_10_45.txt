@BarackObama @SenatorReid Democrats need ignorant voters n the 2 to 3 percentage points from voter fraud. Thats why they fight voter ID laws
@BarackObama We want our Country back, what the fuck you going to do about that asshole
@BarackObama When a party depends on the "ignorant" voter to win. That shows you what that party thinks of its supporters.
@BarackObama We need to have voters pass an aptitude test before they vote so that a president like Obama will never happen again.
@BarackObama This abysmal failure we call president has spent 805 hours golfing and 600 hours in intelligence briefings. Pathetic.
@BarackObama You know your in trouble when Obama is talking about the economy and the lowest job participation rate, $4 gas, high utilities
@BarackObama save kobani!! stop ISIS!!!!!
@BarackObama I am one hundred percent with them fair is only fair
“@BarackObama: These businesses wanted their employees to be fairly compensated.. #RaiseTheWage ” company endorsement
@BarackObama #savekobane
@BarackObama While other companies are choking the economic goose, these companies are wisely leading, thus win-win for them & employees.
@BarackObama now we need more businesses to try to do it as well
@BarackObama not waiting for congress... Sad just do it!
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama fair compensation is important in any business,actions is necessary/implementation should be considered.
@BarackObama Bull, you threatened them.
@BarackObama dont forget to add Aldis grocery store to that list.$12-13 hour to start.

"@BarackObama: These businesses wanted their employees to be fairly compensated. So they took action. #RaiseTheWage "
@BarackObama follow me
@BarackObama and that is why a shake shack hamburger costs $4.95 and a "DOUBLE" costs $7.65...The cost gets passed to the consumer.
@BarackObama All overprices stores to never shop in
@BarackObama So @Gap is paying those kids in Singapore making clothes more than the minimum wage?!  Or just the pale kids at the mall?
@BarackObama By the way Mr. pres. If anyone is waiting on #congress to do ANYTHING they have wasted that time.

@BarackObama they probably get better talent than their competition, and thus pay more for it
@BarackObama Good for them, they did so without statist intervention. This proves capitalism works.
@BarackObama what about all the small businesses that won't be able to afford the minimum wage increase?
@BarackObama @YouGiveMeFever7 
And then on the other hand, there's Papa John's...
@BarackObama we have more important issues facing America today
@BarackObama :-)
@BarackObama Here's the deal on fair wages, give tax breaks to businesses that give a fair deal!
@BarackObama maybe you should worry about paying our men and women in the military more first
“@BarackObama: These businesses wanted their employees to be fairly compensated. So they took action. #RaiseTheWage"no small businesses...
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage not nearly as effective as #RaiseTaxesOnTheWealthiest. But you already know this. #ClassWarfare #Inequality #p2
@BarackObama We need more companies like this to help repair the damage you have done to this country. We are better off with you at golf co

“@BarackObama: These businesses wanted their employees to be fairly compensated. So they took action. #RaiseTheWage ”
@BarackObama Companies in the good old days, when middle class was growing, paid a good wage, provided pensions, healthcare, etc. #vote
@BarackObama IBM and Endicott-Johnson treated employees fairly, avoided unions, grew market, prospered, stocks excelled.
@BarackObama What about garment workers in #Cambodia who make clothes for likes GAP and are paid 180 a month. US Corp needs consciousness
@BarackObama Very interesting, but what are you going to do about the #IS slaughtering of #Kurdish fighters in #Kobani ?
@BarackObama we shouldn't wait if we know its correct. waitin on congress?? that's all we ever do.
@BarackObama Awesome. Hopefully we all start seeing the bigger picture as a United Nation. I'll be voting for the first time in my life :)
