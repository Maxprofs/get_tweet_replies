@BarackObama 
Shit's hitting the fan and your tweeting about Fox News?
@borforall @jimcc66 @BarackObama What if anything would BO know about the "real world." You do know doctors are refusing to take Obamacare.
@dblozik @borforall You obviously don't know that Obamacare is not actually insurance. No dr would be asked to accept Obamacare! Geesh!
@BevDiane @borforall No of course what would I know about health care and insurance. I have only been a BSN for 30 years.
@dblozik @borforall Then it seems you would know that Obamacare is not insurance in and of itself but an exchange!
@BevDiane @borforall Your semantics don't matter. Whatever you want to call it, it is useless because doctors are refusing to accept it!
@dblozik @borforall You are such a good example if today's right wing. Angry ignorance. I'm glad there are more of us than there are of you!
@BevDiane What is untrue about my statement that doctors are refusing Medicaid and Medicare? It is a fact that I see personally every day.
@BarackObama big diff between real world& Obama ImaginaryWorld Obamacare not working but UR always golfing how can UB in touch w/real world?
@PlainUnamerican  Please show where it's not working bc all the studies show it is. RW hates that ppl can see a dr when they are sick! Why?
@BevDiane People could see doctor b4 regardless of insurance or ability 2pay. U explain Y my premiumsR going up 24% Jan +$1000 added 2deduct
@PlainUnamerican Easy. You have lousy insurance. Get better.
@BevDiane I do wish it was that easy. Its thru my employer. Remember OCare forces company 2provide this I looked in2 the healthmarket &worse
@PlainUnamerican Companies should offer healthcare to their workers. You have a problem with that?
@BarackObama YEA  MY I INSURANCE WENT UP $174.00 A MONTH BUT DEDUCTIBLE WENT FROM $1500 TO 6500. THANKS ASSHOLE
@Dymodon @BarackObama Get a better policy. Easy.
@BarackObama @ZachIsHere Affordable? Who's paying for this? Wasn't the gov about to default on debts? Where'd the $$ come from?
@The_Zimmer_Man @BarackObama @ZachIsHere Maybe they used some money from all the GOP wars!
@BarackObama my ex-wife insurance for her and our son just doubled - thank you!!!!
@ThelvenMichael @BarackObama Get better insurance. Easy now!
@BarackObama You are a petty little man  #Shameful
Complete failure like everything else you touch.  Failed lawyer and failed politician. You excelled only at being a racist criminal
@barackObama I think your Twitter account got hacked cuz this is a MAJOR JOKE....
Still drinking your own cool aid
.@BarackObama DAAAAAYUM
@BasedSexyPonder @BarackObama TWEET HAS ME SO HYPED
@BarackObama 
Oh my God.  No.  This is a joke.
President Obama: While affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well in the real world.
@misskathrynhyde The leader of the free world taking a(nother) dig at a (the same) cable news channel. What a complete & utter embarrassment
Hi Suze! Just wanted to share that I have mad respect for your lack of hypocrisy on this issue despite party affiliation. You go girl! 
Thank you 
This didn't age well.
Lol, only 3k RTs what a scrub, that Obamer.
Too funny! Who will people buy the insurance from? Who can afford $6,000 -$10,000 deductibles?
As someone speaking from your "real world" Ocare is NOT AFFORDABLE and will soon be NOT AVAILABLE 
as a muslim traitor this must thrill you
Was that an April fool?
Did go back in the home from which you came from
Please go back into the hole from which you came
Have a Heart Growing Up With Child Abuser's & Angry Marxist influences, will screw up anyone! God Bless America?
DL Club? imagine the hell..
You said it, man. 100+ attacks, no question. Trump's the king cry baby.
How does he know? HE NEVER NEEDS TO PAY FOR IT!
Lying pos.
Not in my world you short sighted,  narrow thinking neo-creatin,
Just wanted to remind u of ur previous outrage. You must be losing ur mind these days over our "ridiculously inappropriate" @POTUS.
@BarackObama You know you've got nothing going for you when you start trolling @FoxNews on Twitter.
I see you for what you are. #Hypocrite
Only if the taxpayer is paying your share
Thank the Lord you are no longer president.
So glad to see all your agenda be rolled back, piece by piece. Finally America is America again.
 yah unhuh keep quoting yourself This is better than any @POTUS tweet.Sorry #PresidentTrump this is super funny! O gets this round #MAGA
.@BarackObama By what possible metric, dingleberry?
@BarackObama I thought Obama stopped watching Fox News and put his head back in the sand ?
@BaronMatrix @BarackObama Chris Howell at @autosoft (213) 261-1716 he be stupid like an Obama... call and discuss.
@BaronMatrix Sorry my mistake you be the "Woman"...
@BaronMatrix What are you saying "Twinkie", can I call you "Twinkie" ??? You know I think I will call you "Twinkie".... "Twinkie" !!!
@BarackObama speak the truth Mr. President.
@powwowasu @BarackObama if only he knew how too
@kirstyns @BarackObama  he does and is.
@powwowasu @BarackObama hahahaha funniest thing I've read all day
They've got a nice room with a view just for you...at gitmo.
Good God, Almighty. The jig has been up on that narrative for years now. Have some shame for crying out loud.
President Obama: While affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well in the real world.
You Sir are clearly not having to. It insurance and pay for it. YOU are wrong
How in the hell can you still lie to the American People? Rates are going up and in Arizona as high as 160%
That's unaffordable to us.
If ACA was so good for the American people why did Congress exempt themselves. It's working so well, they're missing out.
I'm in the real world, it's no where's near pretty well for me and mine
Sir,do u do drugs,honestly,I'm not being sarcastic,if u do please stop n if u don't,please start,your grasp on reality is seriously lacking
Barack, you should be able to afford a better joke writers for ur tweets when ya pull down 400K from Wall Street. this 1 bombed
Oh Look Obama is having a go at comedy.
He's good, I laughed.
Did you learn your comedy routines in Kenya when a baby.
That's just sad 
Obama. That's pure bullshit. You've never been in the real world for starters!!!
You were a terrible failure as a president bcos u failed to live in reality.
This tweet has not aged well
Hey can I keep my plan yet? How about my doctor? Where's that$2500 savings? Actually it should be at least $7500' cuz my ins went up $5000.
Crawl under a rock, Barry. You've done enough damage to this country. Time for a real leader to clean up your blunders. Ya know?!?
Those trips 2 fairyland aren't doing u any good stop taking them
Your bigotry knows no bounds
So how you like us now? Your people of USA, thrown under the bus so your illegals/refugees/"POOR" live better than working class. Rookie
Wake up! He thinks you are stupid enough to think #Obamacare isn't DEAD!
thanks Obama!
delusional
And that world is where?
how are you paying for it?  You are not, just running up debt.  Not all get book deals like yours. UR always spending others $
With all respect, what part of high monthly cost and 10k Ded don't you understand? Hardly affordable to the majority
 my annual deductible per family member could buy a car a year! My premium is higher than ever. U looted 300 BIL from Fannie/Freddie, thief
What planet are from again?
go away #WorstPresidentEver
Please make the correction he is the Former president please.. we have a legitimate current president, and that is @POTUS.
I couldn't keep my plan. I have not seen my $2500. Many hospitals/doctors don't take my insurance now. Explain how it working pretty well.
If you have $5000 for the deductible Obamacare can be used providing your HC didn't drop you. Why can't we have HC we give you?
and look at it now...falling apart..everyone is jumping ship..You ruined the system even more if possible..good going. Job well done
Thank God you are no longer viable to true Americans who lost their Healthcare under your presidency.
And what world are you referring To? Go back to your real world vacation.
@Barb4TRUMP lost my doctor and my plan as soon as Dems blew HC up. Maybe OC works for lazy ppl, but not for WORKING class
no its not, you're not fooling anyone.
ha!As usual you are only referring to your half fan base.U spent your presidency shoving your will upon the other half.ACA $$$$
are you sure because it just went UP
You don't live in the real world, u live on ur fantasy bubble which is gonna burst cause u will screw up and get snagged!
It is that alternate universe you live in.
.@BarackObama whatever happened to previous president's not commenting let alone attacking sitting president?!?
No respect for office
uh.... I'm in the real world and can't afford health insurance. Not working 4 me genius.
Except 4 the 50% or higher premiums & higher deductibles & 3 large Ins Co's bailing & Aetna's CEO say's it's in a death spiral
more example of BHO graciousness... s/
- could you retweet this everyday so we don't forget how bad your legacy is?
That is another in a long list of lies. AFA was poorly designed, written and executed. Very expensive and its failing!
No sir, it's not affordable.  Costs are skyrocketing
The left ignores that Barry had an obsession with Fox News...
It's NOT working! I have $8000 deductible had to choose not to by my daughter $350 meds. You are out of touch with reality
This comment didn't age well.....

 “While affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well in the real world.“ ~@BarackObama
yea, but no.
Great Fucking Job guy.
go away and stay gone.
You don't know a damn thing about "The Real World". Play golf and go away.
- Not for my family….
Hahahaha, not! Time to change your bong water.
@toreilly Affordable for who....
Wrong.
providing slackers with subsidized health benefits while the working people pay.. working well huh
You don't live in the real world, most of us that do can't afford your health care. #worstpresidentever #wontbemissed
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA surely you jest, right?
Delusional as when you were in the White House. Just go golfing...
@ItsJustJill @GOP  should ignore repeal and just allow ACA to die on its own accord. It will, soon -- and @TheDemocrats fail.
@ItsJustJill yea it's great , three insurance providers in three years, rates doubled , and coverage worse . Just play golf !
Where might that be?
Is this a joke?
Spoken like a person who doesn't have to buy his/her own insurance Marie (Antoinette).
i cannoffivially call u a private citizen ass. Your "law" is a disastet
For the poor it's better than nothing - but many of them are truly disappointed.  Sorry.  You didn't create a hot product.
You took away access by millions by making our policy deductibles unaffordable.
Bahahaha!! My premiums are up 69%. It has been a coloosal failure in every aspect. I hope Trump lets it blow up!
except all those people who lost their coverage, saw premiums skyrocket &  are forced to buy a service they can't afford to use
would that be Obamalamd where you get your healthcare for free?
Headline from the Onion?
you are still clueless
Just what fucking world is that? The fantasy world in your liberal/socialist dreams? #traitor
You are full of soooooo much shi*!  Just go away.
lol more than two years later and nobody likes this. You know why? Because it's #fakenews
@WillKremer welcome 2 being a democrat here are some donkey cookies

@BarackObama  A real threat to Freedom is when you need health care to avoid death.  That's when you thank God for Obamacare.
@BarackObama: While affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well.
Ebola RT@BarackObama While affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well in the real world
@BarackObama it was with high sprit of fellow feeling that you fought for this #bill. I think the fight continues.
“@BarackObama While affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it’s working pretty well.." US "Prensa Corrupta"
@BarackObama They fairly report downsides of AFA, you cover it up. You can't stand media outlets who aren't obedient lapdogs. Mr. Obama.
@BarackObama Just tryinig to get by.  Paying MORE and getting LESS like every other average citizen I know.  What world are you living in?
@BarackObama not working for me....premiums went up for less insurance!
Watch Fox you might learn something about our America that we like!
@BarackObama no access to doctors on Medicaid for the disabled because now the small amount of providers cant cover the amount on it
@BarackObama No Mr President your health plan is not working...it has made it so bad that being on Disability have no access to any docs

@barackobama
Thank U, Pres .@BarackObama for calling out .@Foxnews. 10mill gained access to HC thanks to ACA.That's a BFD. #p2 #tcot #ccot #teaparty #gop
@BarackObama   If it is working so well, why aren't you and Congress required to participate in your "affordable health care"?
@BarackObama Hopefully, one day we'll have affordable healthcare for everyone...
