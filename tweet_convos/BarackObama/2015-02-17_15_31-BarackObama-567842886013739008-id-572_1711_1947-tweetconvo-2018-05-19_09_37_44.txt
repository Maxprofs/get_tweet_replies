@Lindajoyable @WhiteHouse Agree but we do need nation health coverage! ALL 1st world nations have it! Fix the ACA but don't repeal!
@Lindajoyable @WhiteHouse The system needed reform! My premiums went up like crazy from 2000-2009 yet now under the ACA they are steady.
@Lindajoyable You realize the ACA is from the Heritage foundation? Newt Gingrich even admitted that! This is a CONSERVATIVE idea!
@Lindajoyable The British NHS is socialized medicine but the ACA is not! I have PRIVATE insurance and my costs have gone down thanks to ACA
@Lindajoyable @WhiteHouse If having the good sense to not rail against the future interests of this country is being a plant, then sure.
@Lindajoyable your rhetoric limits intelligent thought and galvanizes the enemy.
@Lindajoyable Your rhetoric and attitude will destroy our species before the end of this century. And you can take it easy with the "!!!'
@WhiteHouse @DemFromCT Can't wait for the numbers on those who 1) didn't really sign up and 2) haven't made any arrangements to actually pay
@RefDemo pretend to themselves that millions aren’t really signing up, or feel obligated to belittle and diminish the actual numbers. Fail.
@DemFromCT Even NYT/WashPost have recognized OCare bogus but some are too personally invested in believing. Was no HC crisis; now there is.
@RefDemo add this: Most Americans Remain Satisfied With Healthcare System  http://www.gallup.com/poll/171680/americans-remain-satisfied-healthcare-system.aspx … so, tbh, dunno what you’re talking about.
@DemFromCT If you're a person who supports single payer I can understand, but this plan is designed to fail, and it is.
@RefDemo I give you national data and you keep talking about me ;-) that’s a disconnect, you know.
@DemFromCT Millions losing their insurance and then rep-signing up for their only option is not a great success.
@RefDemo meanwhile millions are signing up. Wouldn’t happen if you were right.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Is that counting all those that had their coverage dropped?

@WhiteHouse Most of the ACA accounts are heavily subsidized or free gov't dependency.It is welfare paid by taxpayers,both rich&middle class
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That's because you threatened them to do so! We reserve the right to be uninsured. But you don't care about freedom
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse And at least 70% are getting public assistance for their plans.  Only a #Democrat would call this a #Success.
@gatewaypundit @WhiteHouse Funny thing about "mandates."
@WhiteHouse Why don't you tell America how almost a million have to wait to file taxes due to another IRS mess up? And more have to refile?
@WhiteHouse Why don't you tell them how many uninsured don't know they will be hit wth a fine for not having insurance?
@WhiteHouse Yeah, Thanks for doubling my premiums. Hope the lazy people enjoy their free stuff.
