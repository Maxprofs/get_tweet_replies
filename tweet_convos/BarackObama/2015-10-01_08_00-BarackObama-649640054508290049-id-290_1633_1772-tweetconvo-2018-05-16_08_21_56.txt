@WhiteHouse Millionaires pitching free shit.  Unbelievably gullible sheeples you liberals/socialists are.
@anniebeans59 @WhiteHouse btw, very interesting that your profile picture is of the POTUS and the YouTube stars that asled him questions.
@anniebeans59 @WhiteHouse well excuse me. Didn't look like a mockery to me. If my profile picture was of Charles Manson would that be a mock
@DaZookah @WhiteHouse Great analogy....you would just look crazy if your pro pic was Manson.  Geesh.
@anniebeans59 @WhiteHouse if it was Manson with make up like Marilyn Manson then it'd be a mockery.
@DaZookah @WhiteHouse Except that you said Charles Manson.  Why would you mock Marilyn Manson?  I guess you have your reasons....
@timeforgravy @WhiteHouse Any degree can be worthless.  It's up to the individual to use the knowledge gained to move ahead.
@WhiteHouse Will @POTUS be donating any of his salary to these "responsible" students? I have 2 kids of my own I need to put thru school
@cparizo @WhiteHouse @POTUS he only makes like, 100k a year. He's not some millionaire from being the POTUS
@DaZookah @WhiteHouse @POTUS not counting all the money he'll make speaking and from his socialist manifestos, er, books
@cparizo @WhiteHouse @POTUS still by no means a millionaire. You're free to do the same thing and make as much money.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama taxpayers footing the bill does not equate to free
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Let's talk Retroactive ...What about those of us who are still paying? Our loans should all be forgiven.
@WhiteHouse It's not free, we the people would pay for it. Please tell the full truth so people realize there is a cost.
@WhiteHouse *
@WhiteHouse it's time to make college for a bachelors free but this is a start.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Instead your beloved #GunFreeZones make community colleges a free-for-all for mass shooters.
@WhiteHouse @mikisetlur who is going to pay for that?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yet those of us saddled down with loans for jobs we can't get because of schools who lied to us get no help
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama free? Somebody is paying for it. Hard working Americans
@WhiteHouse Define "responsible students."
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Who will pay? We have 20T in debt.
@WhiteHouse College graduates r not capable of getting a job w their parents This is what u get w govt involvement https://hbr.org/2013/12/parents-may-be-your-secret-weapon-for-recruiting-and-retaining-millennials/ …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama y
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yes, but by giving community college to Pearson testing monopoly, you have made comm, college impossible for most.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama your the best President ever!!!
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Wise words from media in Oregon
@WhiteHouse @chrisrock Sorry Chris but Tussin wont solve this issue WE r broke & as YOUR MOMMA taught u-nothing is free Stop being a puppet!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Pls stop making everything free. I WANT 2 work hard for what I have. #pride #accomplishment #wussificationofamerica
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama free? Nope. NOTHING is free.somebody has to pay for it. My bro worked his way through college. End of story.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it is useful
@WhiteHouse WOW, when GADDAFI gave people free education in Libya you killed him.. #MiddleFingerToYou
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You've turned Comm. College over to Pearson, which spells FAILURE for all. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alan-singer/pearson-education-new-york-testing-_b_1850169.html …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama is an enemy of public education and the darling of Wall Street. He lied to us; he betrayed us
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama well what's your definition of a responsible student.. Go back to Kenya, Barry.
@WhiteHouse Maybe Ovomit can pay for his #Free_Community_College plan by increasing the tax-rate on highly-paid Hollywood celebrities?
@WhiteHouse YES It's time to invest in college-level education for ALL. WE ALL KNOW that high school is not enough in this modern economy.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what about people that already went...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama FREE COLLEGE FUNDED BY TAX DOLLARS ! WHERE WILL ALL THESE GRADUATES FIND THESE JOBS ?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I agree free college for all ages. Everybody deserves a chance.
Communists!! RT @tonjabell: @WhiteHouse @BarackObama Get a job, save money.....No Socialism!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @WhiteHouse Where's the love for THIS young lady
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama De acuerdo: Colegio gratis para los estudiantes responsables → http://HeadsUpAmerica.us/Act   https://amp.twimg.com/v/bba215dd-672b-4d30-95e5-7a61cdd28045 … …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama define "responsible students"
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama From where will this $ come? If we could afford it, it'd be a nice idea. What about our current nat'l debt/deficit?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and how do you decide who is or who is not responsible...
@WhiteHouse Absolutely! Nobody should have to forego a college education because they can't afford it.
@WhiteHouse @ClaudiaLennhoff  Eww! The timing could have been better
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I'd like to add that a college education in general is something that should be available to all citizens.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Nothing is free and you guys know it! The money comes from hard working Americans..so stop the lies!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama - not free BUT a tuition reimbursement plan via a tax deduction based on grade. Similar to Corp plans. No free ride
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Such a differ attitude i like this ..... i am ayyanperumal from South India. Working in a News Media In Chennai.
@WhiteHouse How about doing it like the rest. Get a loan, get a job and pay off the loan. No bumming from the tax payer that way.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama when Gov't pays, it's not free! Get with capitalism not socialism
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama no and no. Do you want to pay for my truck, it's my wage earner. Same as college is an investment in theirs.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama don't you get tired of being wrong about everything? There is no free lunch!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Responsible? How about we do like other modern countries and make it free for anyone who wants it?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Nothing is free, somebody pays. In this case it is those of us who pay taxes. Want to see quality go down? Do this.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Cap how many students are admitted to each school each year. Kids with D-grades in HS don't need college but skills
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Frankly, I DISAGREE with making community college free. Lower cost-ok-- but - some skin in the game is CRITICAL.
@WhiteHouse No such thing as "free".
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Chris Rock is an idiot.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Let's protect our community colleges first. Thats a call to action. Stop fooling around and do what must be done.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Great! Who is going to pay for it?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama free for who?  Obama planning to rob 525 accts
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The leader is to blame catch and executed them
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  good idea,
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 19 trillion in debt but more freebies. Dems are completely out of touch. I know, force teachers&profs pay cuts.
@WhiteHouse Can you at least be honest? Nothing is free, it's all funded by tax payers and not all tax money is used responsibly.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #free is the most expensive word in the dictionary.
. @WhiteHouse No. I can't afford to pay for others.Nobody should.Personal responsubility & choices.Celebs&Obama can pay for it personally.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama when you get something for free you get what you paid for.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What do you define a "responsible student" as, though?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Nothing is truly free when it comes from the government. Who will employ the grads? Have you seen unemployment figs
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ... and those jobs and skills that our kids will be training for exist... where? Does it include airfare to there?
@WhiteHouse I guess it's worth the gamble?? They can't shoot everyone!!!
@WhiteHouse Yes!!!!!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #stand with ucc

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama if they get it for free they won't appreciate what they have been given. Work / pay for it then u will appreciated.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama freedom for biafra Obama
@WhiteHouse There is no such thing as free college! Somebody has to pay for it! My recommendation is the student should pay for it!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You pay
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Get the govt out do colleges stop hiking prices. You have tripped debt
@WhiteHouse  I paid for my Community College. May I be compensated? I deserve to be compensated. Isn't that the phrase these days? TIC
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ... Yes they need to be able to carry legal guns ..!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama our country is great because we have the best colleges and universities in the world.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama やっぱりアメリカ合衆国に行ってみたい！
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  ok I'm trying it let me get the follow back
@WhiteHouse You do realize you don't have a magical money tree; universities and teachers will expect to be paid... how is this "free"?
@WhiteHouse It's free, we'll pay for it with our massive surplus! Oh, we have a deficit? So We'll steal Trillions from people to cover this.
@WhiteHouse <<< they talked about colleges just prior to college shooting in oregon btw
@WhiteHouse well if Chris rock is paying for it. Oh he isn't?  Oh I see. A-hole
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Nothing is free, taxpaying citizens foot the bill.
@Fisheswithfeet @WhiteHouse @BarackObama Can we please call Green Lantern to fix this idiocy now!?!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama creative students like me :) Need royalty free audio for pro works? 2418 new music, https://secure.istockphoto.com/portfolio/chadoland#1c90f30a …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama so you going to convince colleges to teach for free or milk the taxpayer for even more tax hikes to pay for it?
@WhiteHouse HELL NO....  MANDATORY 3YRS MILITARY.THEN MAYBE...
BUILD A STRONG COUNTRY FIRST... JUST SAYING., I SERVED US ARMY!!!
#FreeGunFreeZones Come one, come all. @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Anyone wanting and having the desire to develop higher learning at an accredited institution should go.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 'free' would be great, but can we start with 'safe'? 10 people died today because nothing is being done.
@WhiteHouse pls define 'responsible' and repercussions if they do poorly on their grades
@WhiteHouse stop saying free, nothing is free! Someone is paying for it.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama awesome. #students #education #america
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Thanks 4 wasting our hard earned $$ 4 this video. Wht not do UR damn job & Fix the mess you've caused, worthless.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Who the hell is gonna pay for it???
@WhiteHouse And nobody pays attention to what a celeb thinks, unless it's the average uninformed Obama voter who is not present with reality
@WhiteHouse By "free" you mean with money confiscated from people who have no obligation to pay for other people's free ride.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama free huh? So we will pay for the slackers that go to class for one day then sell their books and withdraw? #joke
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I have a college degree but I would so love to do this I would so love to do this
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Roseburg  Oregon . This has to stop. What do we do?
@WhiteHouse Kinda cool!  Like free is a very good price!  But k-12 is free right?  Maybe a better k-12 should be the focus!
@WhiteHouse How will we defeat our $18+ trillion debt? Prepare for unfunded liabilities? #Responsible
@WhiteHouse When a politician says "free" it actually means taxpayer funded. #WakeUpAmerica #ObamaLies
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse  yes, it should be for those who would like to go.
@WhiteHouse @JonathanJossef For ALL students.An error at 16 shouldn't keep you out of college.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama   I love this idea!  It's a good idea.  It will help bring innovation back the the States.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes if ill use our funds in good way
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What a joke! Is Barry hiding in WH transgender bathroom while Putin runs all over Syria & brings Iran in ?
.@WhiteHouse @BarackObama RESPONSIBLE is the operative word, not just students but an incentive for parents too, to PUSH their kids #rewards

@BarackObama @WhiteHouse Are you kidding? Community Colleges used to be free in this country. Our elected officials voted it away.
.@WhiteHouse @BarackObama "if you dont teach your son a trade, then you are teaching him to be a thief" (Im paraphrasing) old german proverb
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Lets make 2 years free for community college students!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #federalizeallgunlaws
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I think education should be free for everyone in the world. Governments should pay teachers and schools.
@WhiteHouse   And who decides who's a 'responsible' student? 
RT this instead if you have a working brain:
If the Democrats are successful in making college free for students, then who pays for it?
@WhiteHouse Taught my kids young nothing is ever free. Someone somewhere will pay.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama This would and will be the best thing ever.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Like the Chinese ‘a two-man comic show’.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes. I. thank. that. need. to. be. done
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama How stupid are you?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What a great opportunity it would be for so many. There would have to be stringent standards to follow.
@WhiteHouse You have to be the (D)umbest man to hold the office. Staggering.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Just like it should be "free" for every kid to do
2 yrs of national service/military.
@WhiteHouse it's a move in a modern direction..  Haters are just going to hate
