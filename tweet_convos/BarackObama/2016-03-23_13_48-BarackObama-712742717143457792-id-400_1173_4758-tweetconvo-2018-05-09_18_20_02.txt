. @BarackObama Why did all the things you promised turn out to be lies? It may be here to stay but it is hurting my small business. #tcot
@moshek258 Google "Obama promises" and you will see he hit many of them...even in the face of GOP obstruction
@Dark_Maturus What about the biggest lie of all? To support & defend the constitution when he has done everything in his power to weaken it.
@moshek258 I think he's done a great job at bringing us toward "a more perfect Union." Plus, his actions have passed Supreme Court muster 
@Dark_Maturus We will have to agree to disagree. The loss of personal and economic liberty is not what the founders had in mind.
@moshek258 we're at full employment, record high stock markets & people can marry regardless of sexual orientation. What else do you want?
@Dark_Maturus called the ACA. I am FORCED to pay for services i/we do not need and would choose not to pay for. That is NOT liberty. 2/2
@moshek258 blame the baby boomers that are retiring lol, not Obama. Also, as full time students my gf & I receive Medicaid. Thanks, truly
@BarackObama how many can afford it bow that they have to moat fornit is a different story.
@BarackObama #AsshatInChief @NancyPelosi #Grubered God I hope not. My coverage is HIGHER because of you jagoffs.
@BarackObama How many can UNH CEOs salary cover rather than deny coverage in 34 states?Highest paid CEO in the country! #Obamacare#GREED
@BarackObama I'm Glad I have coverage, now that I pay $300+ monthly for insurance how am I suppose to pay deductibles?

@BarackObama I love Obama care as a NP and a patient!
@BarackObama ya & my friend makes too much to get it but not enuf for private coverage bs & she's fined for it.Obama is a big disappointment
@BarackObama There is only one person that knows that, and honey - it ain't you

@BarackObama @0045Modou
@BarackObama ...and more than that have lost coverage
@BarackObama you're almost gone.  So is bamacare.
@BarackObama if #ACAWorks so well, then eliminate the tax mandate to see if people stay on it.
@BarackObama pres I like have a sit with you if there's time .
@BarackObama you meant to say "have been forced to purchase something or pay a penalty"...
@BarackObama Yeah Mitch McConnell.....Obamacare is strong
@BarackObama Now we need to work on streamlining the system. Medicare has become a quagmire of chaos and confusion since Part D came in.
@BarackObama 
I hope so, it would be a huge step backwards to change back.
@BarackObama to the @realDonaldTrump leave it alone and rest of the #GOPDebate B/c loss of #jobs will result in repealing it
@BarackObama Equal # have lost coverage - enjoy your spring break
@BarackObama Also establish Obama foundation that benchmark globally - each country racism particularly to Africans!
@BarackObama I bet you it's dead under water if @realDonaldTrump has his way. 

@BernieSanders is the only hope disappointed Hillary
@BarackObama yeah like after 50 million lost their coverage. #ThanksObama
@BarackObama good job Mr.President!!
@BarackObama yeah but I can't afford my premium and my deductible is $6000 so I'm just paying out of pocket anyway. It's the worst.
@BarackObama your healthcare plan is costing average Americans huge premiums u r hurting USA --smoke and mirrors #Trump2016
@BarackObama not much Sir, US have over 250mill citizens i guess, but a beginning, greating from Germany.
@BarackObama Not likely Asshat,and your grandchildren's children will never see gun control.

@BarackObama Nope!! Bye Bye to Obama, Obamacare and the Obamanation of our country!!!

@BarackObama thank you Mr President but we still pay a bill. What can we do to change?
@BarackObama  20 million people also lost their jobs smart ass
@BarackObama nope.  Will be repealed in January, 2017
@BarackObama Americans deserve to have single payer healthcare. ACA is a great step forward, but not the finish line. #BernieSanders
@BarackObama It's working in states that took the expansion.  places like #Florida where the governor didn't. it is outrageously expensive.
@BarackObama thank you Obamacare.
@BarackObama get rid of the damn fine!  This is a blatant tax on the poor and is hurting a lot of already struggling Americans!
@BarackObama 
#NotThatSimple
@BarackObama It is NOT because they wanted to!
