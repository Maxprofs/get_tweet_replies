@BarbofPA @BarackObama hello hater,how are you?eating beans yet..
@BarbofPA @BarackObama no because the ass keeps speaking an its your mouth,and it appears all that comes out is shit..
@BarackObama really, after five years of you foolish obamacare, companies are selling and adding to jobless rate?
@websquaw @BarackObama @RobertBluey Too bad; you took the easy way out; invest your money elsewhere
@GerryLaures @BarackObama @RobertBluey I wouldn't put my $$ on obamacare, to be sure
@websquaw @BarackObama @RobertBluey Not an easy decision; more lower income people are covered medically; don't assume everyone is like you
@GerryLaures @BarackObama 'more' in comparison to? know how many had ins b4 obamacare & how many real 'low income' covered? No u don't.
@BarackObama my dog has created more shovel ready jobs than you
@BarackObama good job,you go pres.
@BarackObama I'm sure you can secure mine.
@BarackObama OMG, HILARIOUS!! YOU TALKING ABOUT P/T JOBS AT MAC'S OR WALMART? YEAH, PROBABLY...NOTHING WORTHWHILE, THAT'S FOR SURE. YOU FAIL
@BarackObama thank u for supporting Greece at this difficult time.we need to put a stop to austerity that has destroyed so many people
@BarackObama We're hiring!
@therealcliffyb I'm always looking to better myself. Hire me.
@BarackObama I like that retailers are upping  the minimum wage; good for the economy; the right thing to do; the free market speaks
@BarackObama #unemployment
@BarackObama Your job is to secure this Nation's freedom Not give our enemies Nukes. Shame on you.
@BarackObama Mr. P. You have millions of exfelons who children are suffering because their families can't work because of a two decade felon
@BarackObama Lie. Its a job sharing economy. We fire and then hire contractors at lower cost because your healthcare is so messed up.
@BarackObama @jhunjhunwalalok is Obama stepping down or what
@BarackObama I'm glad your'e doing the best you can @BarackObama.  Future is looking bright.
@BarackObama Low quality jobs! #Lies #Conceit #GetOutOfAmericansWay
@barackobama
@BarackObama Thats because the F T jobs are gone  due to obamacare and they are all part time! THX!!!!
@BarackObama at Burger King
@BarackObama again you are a lier
@BarackObama Then why are so many on welfare programs?
@BarackObama Also for people my age and single & no other source of income, minimum wage isn't going to cut it.
@BarackObama Only if you are a college graduate or a young person, but for people my age 52 and not a college graduate, good luck.
@BarackObama another lie nobody is looking for jobs, that's why there's more openings. Stop lying .. It's all you do
@BarackObama STAGNET WAGES FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS!!!!!! THE RICHER GET RICHER!!!!!!#HELPFORTHEMIDDLECLASS!!!!!!! WE PAY FOR EVERYTHING!!!!!!
@BarackObama yep, at 7 bucks an hour, 15 hours a week, as most employers can't afford to insure their employees.  #thanksobama
@BarackObama coming out of one of the worst recessions ever I'm not surprised
@BarackObama i need a well paying job
@BarackObama Just the opposite here, where there are job closings every day, But Leaders insist applying very wrong and bad policies.
@BarackObama wishing I could get one..
@BarackObama That is crap, where are these jobs? only in Obama  tweets
@BarackObama to be filled with illegals.
@BarackObama How can we be proud when there are children who can't get the mental health care they need and kids are going hungry everyday
@BarackObama is someone tracking the quality of the job openings?
@BarackObama A good thing - but one problem: there are probably 2-3x as many applications, and too often are filled internally.
“@BarackObama: "Today there are more job openings in the United States than any time since 2001." —President Obama”
@BarackObama again with the lies.
@BarackObama Part time jobs sure, that isn't helping us Mr. President.
