@BarackObama It is only about more redistribution of wealth and has nothing to do with climate change! It's a HOAX!
@BarackObama 
I swear no one makes me laugh like you do.
you must have stopped laughing now that coal is being shutdown for a more environmental friendly power source.
@BarackObama Tripled in price!  Or maybe 3 people are using it instead of one.
@BarackObama @chriscmooney I love the wind in my face when I go for a ride in the car.
@BarackObama  COOL
@BarackObama wind and solar will never be able to supply our energy needs in your children's lifetime.    Maintenance is costly.
@BarackObama so has taxes
@BarackObama
Keep up with your good deeds Mr. President.

@BarackObama @chriscmooney can't wait till Shell and Exxon lose their shit and desperately try to maintain the status quo.
@BarackObama Please do not listen to the biofuel industry. The history will expose their lies.
@BarackObama If you invest in biofuel, farmers will destroy forests to gain larger farmland. And It urges the other countries to follow.
@BarackObama And eventually it will lead to soil degradation due to the lack of biomass.
@BarackObama Taking away biomass from forests starve animals to death, cz those animals eat bugs that eat fallen woods and leaves.
@BarackObama Please see how parm oil is expanding and destroying forests. Biofuel is not carbon neutral, it takes away large carbon sink.
@BarackObama Great news! But please ban the use of biofuel. It will destroy forests and biodiversity on this planet. Please see how parm oil

@BarackObama  I understand you are the President of the United States but it is okay for you to be passionate in the open too about Jesus.
@BarackObama Mr.President as a Christian why don't you speak more openly about your faith? I think Christians need to hear and see it.
@BarackObama maybe, but it was incredibly low in 2008, so it's not such a huge achievement....
