@BarackObama Detroit?
@DanielGStone wasn't it Bush who bankrupted that?
@HannaMarieP ...the city of Detroit? Negative. Swing and a miss.
@DanielGStone Detroit is historically a metaphor for the auto industry. So excuse me for inferring something obvious. Don't be an ass.
@HannaMarieP I didn't catch the connection! Sorry, wasnt trying to be an ass!
@DanielGStone The decline of Detroit started over 50 years ago. So what he's saying is true in the city of Detroit.Look at the 1943 riots.
@HannaMarieP Good point bud. Was literally making a joke but certainly Bush caused a lot of Detroit probz. Get that hur done!
