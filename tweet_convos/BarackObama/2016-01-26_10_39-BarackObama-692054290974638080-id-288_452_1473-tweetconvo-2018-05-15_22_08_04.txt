@BarackObama @JAPITTER the same claims were made concerning NAFTA and KORUS. It didn't pan out.
.@liberalboxer @BarackObama @JAPITTER it's a lie. The people who did the study are all corporate bankers. I looked up the Peterson Institute
@1031ent whatever...I trust PBO 100%... we can agree to disagree on this. @liberalboxer @BarackObama
.@JAPITTER @liberalboxer @BarackObama
@1031ent again lets agree to disagree on this...nothing will change my mind...I'm sure the same goes for u 2. @liberalboxer @BarackObama
.@JAPITTER @liberalboxer @BarackObama .... It is called facts. You should consider looking at facts instead of just blind support.
@1031ent @JAPITTER @BarackObama there has never been a trade agreement negotiated by this Country that didn't hemorrhage jobs.
@BarackObama lies.
@BarackObama This is a major disappointment. .I thought you had the PLANETS welfare in mind.I voted for you twice.You support this.BAD IDEA
@BarackObama Easier fracking rules ..I take my votes back.You are a major blunderer
.@BarackObama  WE DON'T WANT THE #TPP. Free Trade Agreements = Lost Jobs. We can't compete w/ Child Labor and no minimum wage.
@1031ent @BarackObama No worries, as child labor ( or human as a whole) can't compete with this:
@BarackObama follow me please BOSS!
@BarackObama

@BarackObama there is a great job that you are doing with the tool that you was handed with .
@BarackObama can you please listen to the little people. We will be worse off if you sign this. Please don't I beg of you. 
@BarackObama A link to the #TPP study would be nice, Mr. President.
@BarackObama TPP will profit countries like Malaysia and Indonesia who have the most human trafficking and slave labor in the world. No TPP.
@BarackObama TPP, raise wages in the USA? By competing with Communist Vietnam whose wages are less than $1 per hour? Your nose is growing.
@BarackObama and if they don't.  R u personally pull that cash out of ur pocket? I doubt it, but u keep talking ur bull $/#t. Ur CORRUPT too
@BarackObama love u Mr Obama
@BarackObama the American worker no longer has faith in agreements it has awful
the only reason why I want to believe is because of you
@BarackObama did The Onion do the study ?
@BarackObama 1) which americans, Mr Pres? 2) thats what NAFTA said. 3) At what price to the people's sovereignty? 4) $15 bill TransCan suit.
@BarackObama unions are as greedy as the politicians they serve. Unions are worse than the corporations they are in bed with.
@BarackObama either support the fight for the preservation of the enviro or come out against it, you can't do both. #downwithTPP
@BarackObama I have agreed with you on most things, but on this Mr. President, you are wrong
. @BarackObama ... :/ seriously ?
@BarackObama   The TPP is BAD for Americans, and just because you say it isn't DOESN'T MAKE IT TRUE.
@BarackObama Is that really the only way? Why not share all the negatives? #informthepeople
@BarackObama I'm making plenty of dough importing goods from China. How does this help American workers who AREN'T in the import business?
@BarackObama I seen lots of so called reports.More jobs,better living conditions,higher wages only followed by news of layoffs,closings,etc,
@BarackObama - sure it will Obama.  That is why there are 95 million Americans out of work, more people coming to this country than ever b4.
@BarackObama Idk, seems to me, all these forgeign trade deals have shipped american jobs overseas. Not a good look, Mr. President.
@BarackObama , how will i get back the $300,000 i lost due to nafta shafta and the chinese nixon trade deals?
@BarackObama idiot
@BarackObama The only thing that will grow our economy is for you to no longer be president.  Till then we shall remain in this hell.
@BarackObama The #TTP will also be bad for the environment, open ways for illegal wildlife transport. There is a better way we can do this
@BarackObama #16MillonesDeCriaturitas  OBAMA SABES LO QUE ES ESTO SKENWNISKS
@BarackObama Who did the study @vj44 ? Sounds like another of your puppets said this
@BarackObama Do you know what else would help boost our economy? Allowing bankruptcy protection on student debt.
@BarackObama @Richzeoli Stop citing studies liar.  Show us proof.
@BarackObama A "Study" is only determined by the questions you ask and the data you control.
.@BarackObama you can manipulate a "study" to your desired outcome. The TPP is NOT good!
@BarackObama Sure it will. Just like NAFTA , Was to create jobs , And it did. But we lost over 3 million . For the few we gain..
@BarackObama  A top official involved in negotiating the TPP + bribes.Shadowy, corrupt, agreements.
@BarackObama And, it's shown that that will be just 1/2% GDP, at cost of 50K jobs and likely with more income inequality.
@BarackObama Japan's economic and fiscal policy minister has been accused of taking major bribes from a Japanese construction company.
@BarackObama You;re such a tool...you're killing American business...and America itself for that matter!
@BarackObama oromoprotests in Ethiopia
. @BarackObama That makes #TPP the biggest corporate giveaway with the power to overrule law and bankrupt countries with reparations!
@barackobama pray for good decision making and finish the sentence each day @mygod247 free ios app. http://Godapp.net 
. @BarackObama What about the part that lets corporate judges invalidate any regulations of any country that harms profits and get damages?
@BarackObama As the best is needed for American workers, #TPP should rage wages. More than the cash amount $2.63 rage will increase workers!
