@ohheyhayl @BarackObama Still can't believe that, what kind of president would put something like this ahead of his people.
@CosmicOdyssey @BarackObama He cant even order flags to be flown at1/2staff?But he can tweet for their holiday,just hours after the massacre
@ohheyhayl @BarackObama Honestly haven't been that angry at a politician in 10 years
@BarackObama A leader would never negotiate with countries that hold hostages or American criminals!
But we know that you're NO leader
@Lg4Lg @BarackObama Yes
