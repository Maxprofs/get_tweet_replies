That is a #BigLie!
@BarackObama inherited a continuing resolution which funded the first few months of FY 2009 at FY 2008 spending levels.
1 week before inauguration, @BarackObama ASKED George W. Bush to request 2nd $350 Billion of TARP money.
Obama got the $$$ but blames Bush!
ALL of the following FY 2009 spending was:
passed by the @NancyPelosi House,
passed by the @SenatorReid Senate, and
signed by @BarackObama…
@BarackObama, not Bush, signed these in FY2009:
2/17/09: $831B AARA
3/11/09: $410B OAA
6/24/09: multi-$B SAA, including “Cash For Clunkers”
The OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of FY 2009 spending was passed by @NancyPelosi @SenatorReid & @BarackObama!
See http://itooktheredpill.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/democrats-deficit-deception/ … for details
It's a 4 Pinocchios #BigLie for @BarackObama to claim:
"When I took office, the deficit was nearly 10 percent of our economy."
George W. Bush didn't build that [FY 2009 deficit = 9.8% of GDP]…
somebody else [@NancyPelosi @SenatorReid & @BarackObama] made that happen!
@BarackObama You know rhe RWNJ's will just scream Benghazi!
@rochshelly @BarackObama it's all they have
.@BarackObama Not entirely true. Approx 8 trillion in nat debt in less than 7 yrs is something to add to the resume.
@BarackObama And National Debt was 5 trillion. Today, its approaching 18 trillion.  Good job, NoBama!
@BarackObama Hang on a second while I hide that 20 trillion under a shell and move it around...
@labratones @BarackObama http://www.treasurydirect.gov/news/pressroom/pressroom_bpd08052004.htm … and http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/feb/27/debt-vs-deficit-whats-difference/ … debt = accumulated deficits
@BarackObama But you have been in office for five years and you are counting part time workers and temp to hire workers
@BarackObama It's not the DEFICIT that's killing us, it's the DEBT!!!!!!  THE DEBT.  D.E.B.T.   DEBT
@BarackObama THANKS TO INCREASED TAXES AND HUGE DEFENSE CUTS. 17 TRILLION IN DEBT NOT COUNTING UNFUNDED LIABILITIES.
