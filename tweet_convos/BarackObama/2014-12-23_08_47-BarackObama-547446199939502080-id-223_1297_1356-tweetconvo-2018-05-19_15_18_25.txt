@WhiteHouse On that note has King Obama taken credit for these things he has no control over?
@librab103 @WhiteHouse  on that note, hasn't he taken a lot of blame for things he has no control over? Can't have it both ways.
@Dok_Kang @WhiteHouse  So for the things that are listed on this tweet, let's give the country as a whole for making it happen!
@librab103 @WhiteHouse Agreed. However some of the decisions he has made set the ball in motion, when there wasn't a lot of buy in.
@Dok_Kang @WhiteHouse What do you mean buy in?
@librab103 @WhiteHouse 1st thing that comes to mind is the bailouts. Ppl said it wouldn't work, Ford stock had dropped to $1 and now trades
@Dok_Kang @WhiteHouse How many automotive companies the US govt gave money to moved overseas?
@librab103 @WhiteHouse Good question.
@WhiteHouse YAY Liberal cities like SFO and Seattle will become the next Detroit!
@librab103 @WhiteHouse The RedStates are poorer than the Blue. The Gulf has good wages from the oil business but southern people have low
@67dfm @WhiteHouse A good rundown on why some red states are poorer than blue ones
@librab103 @67dfm @WhiteHouse  more interesting is several  of those states have low black populations and minorities in general.
@WhiteHouse Business investments are only a good thing if the money stays where the company is not spent overseas!
@WhiteHouse Doesn't the GDP already include consumer spending?
RT @WhiteHouse: 

Debt:↑
Welfare recipients:↑
Median household income: ↓

GOP took Congress!
@instapundit @WhiteHouse ...Yeah, it's amazing how quickly the rot stopped spreading the moment Scott Brown took away the Dem supermajority.
@moelane @instapundit @WhiteHouse Financial ruin began when Dems took over Congress in 01/07. Thought GOP missed pointing that out.
