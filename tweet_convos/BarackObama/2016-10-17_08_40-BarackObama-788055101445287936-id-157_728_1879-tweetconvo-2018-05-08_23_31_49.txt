@BarackObama @POTUS Can you please show me how? I have a Son in college about to have to withdraw. 

Thanking you in advance
The white house is filled with a lot of college graduates who can't even figure out how to balance a budget. Basic math.
@ToksDuro

That is good, but what about the student loans for older graduates that still pay 30+ yrs. later?
@BarackObama @POTUS no one should be priced out if health insurance either but that's what is fucking happening.
@BarackObama @POTUS thanks
@BarackObama @POTUS And all we get are a bunch of triggered little snowflakes
@BarackObama @POTUS More free ice cream...never ends with Dems. #Paydowndebt #Freemarketapproach!
@BarackObama @POTUS all lies YOUR CORRUPT
@BarackObama @POTUS The hard working middle class pays back for the rest of their lives ..terrible
Why then offer FREE education 2 foreign students & illegal immigrants 1st, after overcharging us for 8 yrs?
@BarackObama @POTUS You have done zero
Obama administration also doubled the national debt.
Doesn't that suggest a race to lower US GDP per capita to global levels? Boost value, increase demand.

@BarackObama @POTUS
degree w/o job in your field=debt slave.Get a clue.
@BarackObama @POTUS how did you come out with another bright idea? How much will this cost us
Not everyone needs a college degree.  We need skilled craftsmen more than highly educated clerks.
@WHLive @POTUS nothing is free - tax payers pay for your fucking brain storms
why do you have to pay for public universities then? Why do we have to pay for books?
@BarackObama @POTUS how about gvng some of tht $ to thse on Soc. Sec. Edctn in the US is a failure. Our rnkng is trrble.
I am aBernie-Crat I am for free College!

CORRECTION: The administration has TAKEN $50Billion from taxpayers to do this!

@BarackObama @POTUS no one should be paid to incite violence starting at minute 7:30. I'm in disbelief.
what progress would that be?
I joined the military to get my DEGREES (Bach,Post-Bacc, Masters (Dec 16)). Missed out on 1st words/steps, but worth it!
why, why should money be no object for the next generation? #equality
I love Obama investing in education. Teabaggers would only dream.
@BarackObama @POTUS por estos lugares la educacion superior es privilegio de pocos. Muy caro
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS no TEXTBOOK should cost a student 3 to 4 hundred dollars apiece either. Help push #Opensource textbook initiatives !
the government should hold local governments accountable for poor grades and if possibly not by budget cuts
you have to turn on Sean Hannity on the radio broadcast...it is unbelievable. James o'keef...WOW.
more parody? It's not about cost, it's about indoctrination with liberal BS.
there it is black and white. Tax tax tax I work hard & pay for my kids college, Y  should we pay for everyone else's.

YOU have inflated America to the POOR HOUSE. Bush 2 and Obama, 2 nut jobs . Sadly, you are proud of it.

@BarackObama @POTUS What a great president we have!! My 4 daughters want to see you and Michelle before you leave!!
@BarackObama @POTUS

Straight out of the tax payer pockets, Obama does not care as is not him money

@BarackObama @POTUS How much did we give the big banks with no arrests?

@BarackObama @POTUS um, that's OUR money you're spending, thank you very much!
@BarackObama @POTUS of course. Banks should be free to give everyine 100k of debt!

@OTCJenCHM @POTUS Cutting year round Pell was counterproductive to the goal. Bring it back to make progress in attainment!

@BarackObama @WhiteHouse @POTUS That will result in college becoming as worthless as a public school education. Gov can't provide quality.
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse @POTUS same in England my daughter has just started her 2nd year at University and to date is over £30k in debt.
@BarackObama @POTUS yes do
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse @POTUS  lobing u my Angel
@JamesOKeefeIII and @Project_Veritas have just exposed @HFA as violent criminals:
Mr POTUS we in this COUNTRY don't hold CHILDREN responsible for PARENTS DEBTS! Please REMOVE  UNFAIR POLICY against KIDS
and added 17 Trillion dollars to the National debt.
please LIFT the policy of letting the US DEPT of EDU DENYING BLACK LOW INCOME CHILDREN their CHILD CREDIT TAX REFUNDS1/2
so stop STEALING from  BLACK LOW INCOME CHILDREN!  by DENYING them CHILD CREDIT TAX REFUNDS! For PARENTS DEBT
:@TrevorNoah:@Stephenathome:@JimmyKimmel:@ConanObrien:@LateNightSeth:@IamJonOliver:@BillMaher:Let Americans know please!
all the money obama gave in cash to country's that want to kill us all would have paid for collage for a lot of people
What a crock! Pell Grants are in fact loans. Now it’s: “You can keep your student loan”!
uh no they're not.
HAHAHAHA 
Cool
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
Please ask all rich and powerful families to attend community colleges Mr President; give them the Kudos.

#EducationMafia
#EducationCartel
Free C. C. programs? If it is in fact free then who is paying for it??
NOTHING is free...but U wouldn't know that.
Same could be said for healthcare
who's money are you investing? Incurring debt for the student alone or future generations of students? 20 trillion?
0
how much has the cost of college increased in the last 8 years?
wow we're blessed Americans immigrants teachers lords Army. College expensive parenting. Hugs
makes sense why illegals get free education & hard working Americans need to get a loan.
Don't improve it,just do it the LIBERAL way. Throw money at it and hope something chages.
yes am desirous home education feeding children. Hugs Lake sti
Yeah I can't afford to go to school - I'm still paying thousands for my kids education
If  you're voting for Trump, you should definitely invest in education for yourself.
See? Left needs to be EDUCATED who to vote for (liberals) The RIGHT just KNOWS a scam (killary)
