@VP The ACA has been a first step, and imperfect.  Many in our country now have health coverage because of it.
@VP @BarackObama No...it means I have a higher premium with less coverage.But you wouldn't know, you've been living off Americans for years.

@VP Forest insurance just makes your friends in the insurance companies rich it takes money and food from the citizens mouths
@VP this is just getting so disgusting.
@VP where the government helps pay for medical school in return for a six years of government work by that doctor and anybody can be seen
@VP but it has to be the right kind of healthcare. I want to be able to choose my team and prescription coverage. Will obamacare do that?
@VP Biden/Warren 2016
@VP instead of force insurance you should have used the same system as the military
@VP @WhiteHouse Since my policy was CANCELED I guess I'll have to wade into that sespool of a billion $ website. Thanks for nothing! #Gruber
@VP @WhiteHouse What's more important, a job or Healthcare?

@VP Dude, how would know anything that pertains to the mind, since you are totally devoid?
@VP @WhiteHouse Having healthcare actually makes some folks feel uneasy.  Just ask your colleagues across the aisle (psst - republicans)
@VP @WhiteHouse Are you implying that people are too stupid to get enrolled before that?  They have to wait for you to do it for them?
@VP @WhiteHouse Gruber has a fifth video out. Have you lying liars seen it yet? More mocking of voters.
@VP @HealthCareGov my work health ins dropped %30 for the 1st time. It had been rising the last 10 yrs. #justsaying
@VP @HealthCareGov *correction. 40%
@VP @WhiteHouse We've been Grubered once before, not falling for same lies. You people are why Americans hate politics.
@VP @WhiteHouse Not to those who had lost their insurance and had to buy into this farce.
@VP @WhiteHouse and for those in the dark http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2014/11/14/did-jonathan-gruber-earn-almost-400000-from-the-obama-administration/ …
@VP @WhiteHouse Says your pal Gruber!!  Is he Hans brother btw?  You can run from him but you cannot hide - just ask Hans.
@VP @WhiteHouse can't believe your walking lock step on illegal immigration in the USA just like your boss (lover) Barry
@VP @WhiteHouse Deceived! The Ugly Face of Modern Progressivism – http://bit.ly/1v7mKAu  #ObamaCare: #GetCovered, #GetScrewed. #TeaParty
@VP @WhiteHouse not if you can't afford the deductible
@VP @WhiteHouse GIVE AMERICAN WORKERS,  RETIREES AN IRS TAX BREAK-WE ARE IN TROUBLE!!!!!
@VP @WhiteHouse  May b good 4 some but the middle class cannot afford it. Health care rates have doubled many lost their doctors.  peace  ?
@VP @WhiteHouse Did you check with #Gruber? He thinkd #wethepeople are stupid.
@VP @WhiteHouse simply rational and highly human quote
@VP @WhiteHouse The program was a Godsend.  However, the insurance companies took advantage of recipients!
@Keisfree Think you’re a politics expert, Keisha? Test your knowledge of current affairs, and maybe win big! http://bit.ly/PredictItNow 
@VP @WhiteHouse The people are not "stupid", I declare that my Arrogant Congresswoman thought she knew better than I and voted for it.
@VP @WhiteHouse Peace of mind comes when you know what you're getting into. #GruberGate
@vp @whitehouse Can you translate that to Gruber (stupid) terms please?
@VP @WhiteHouse #WeAreNotStupid!
@VP @WhiteHouse  I are too stoopid what is this
@VP
@VP Unless you have Medicare which forces you to get the cheaper drugs that DON'T work and no longer pays for some medical devices! REPEAL!
@VP @jesseclee44 #GruberGate is a big "F"ing deal!!!
@VP @HealthCareGov how many people lost their coverage before the ACA they act like the insurance companies were just angels
@VP @HealthCareGov Sure even if it's shitcare. Why can't I have the same healthcare you have?
@VP they will undo the aca; but let's make it a success so it can return when the American people come to their senses
@VP Having a government that lies and deceives the people hurts my peace of mind. #ACA #Gruber #IRS #Benghazi #fastandfurious #Holder #you
@VP @HealthCareGov Who can afford or want to pay those insurance premiums? Less subscribers this year. Only a single payer system can work.
@gtv053y3 @_NewJobNow_ I have a better job for you go here
@VP @HealthCareGov I had coverage but it is cancelled eff 12/1... Thx dipshit!
@KeepUrDoctor @VP @HealthCareGov Maybe if you paid your premium payment you would not have been cancel, STOP BEEN DUMB
@kirkcs3 @VP @HealthCareGov Learn to spell before u call someone dumb. I pay my bills.
@KeepUrDoctor @VP @HealthCareGov So you are just a big FAT LIAR,FACT CHECK AHOLE no Insurance company can just cancel you without a reason
@kirkcs3 @VP @HealthCareGov Douchebag, my plan was cancelled by my carrier. Don't talk abt shit that u know nothing about.
@KeepUrDoctor @VP @HealthCareGov WELL SUE YOUR CARRIER, What happens when you don't pay your car insurance
@kirkcs3 @VP @HealthCareGov Johnathan Gruber was right... You are Exhibit A!
.@VP .@jesseclee44 Be smarter than UR friends. See what is trending in Congress in real time http://4pia.com 
@VP Cold comfort for millions who lost coverage due to Obamacare.
@JWBritten @VP Because insurance options never change for people before ACA? This is tired rhetoric.
@VP "This is a big fucking deal."
@YaGurlKB @VP Only to people like you lacking a vocabulary.
@VP 
I'll have all the peace of mind I need when you and the other numb nuts are finally out of office!
@jhasstn @vp http://goo.gl/SiGBVE 
@VP Let's hope Republicans' TEE don't repeal ACA AKA Obama Care!
