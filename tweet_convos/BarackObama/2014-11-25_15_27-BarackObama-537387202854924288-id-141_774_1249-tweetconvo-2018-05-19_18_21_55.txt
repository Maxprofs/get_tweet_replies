@MediocreDave ive moved on to being angry as hell about ferguson instead
@BarackObama #Ferguson  this is bullshit get the people off the streets. Show the people the facts so there's no more excuses.
@BarackObama It is not the immigrant that gives the advantage, sir. It's the liberty provided by the values & traditions of our society.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama we are a nation of legal immagrants,
@BarackObama America should include Mexico and Canada

@BarackObama #ImmigrationAction #immigration BHO admits exec order changes the immigration law.
“@BarackObama: "Being a nation of immigrants gives us this huge entrepreneurial advantage over other nations." #ImmigrationAction” Act now!
@BarackObama in a way, we are all immigrants.
@BarackObama @IAMmp94 but they were all done legally.
@BarackObama this is true. of how Mitt Romney took industry oversea's in order not to pay lower wages in other country's
@BarackObama  hi people love to that do some for him
@BarackObama Brasil live with all people of the planet in peace , why not?
@BarackObama A nation of LEGAL immigrants, sir!
@BarackObama you talk out your just think about the billions in medical aid we will pay out
@BarackObama Sure and lets their scum come in along with all other kinds of criminals and drugs.
@BarackObama how do you provide jobs for immigrants when your own people feel its their right first?
@BarackObama flip, then South Africa is so ahead we're at the end again...
@BarackObama Tbh immigrants from other countries willingly came here for a better life, it boosted our diversity and economy
@BarackObama  thats insane (-_-)
@BarackObama how about telling companies to stop taking advantage of the immigrants workers and pay attention to those in poverty
@BarackObama I thought you had an #Indigenous population but are they all gone?
@BarackObama as long as they don't have a Walmart in their community... but hell yes.
“@BarackObama: "Being a nation of immigrants gives us this huge entrepreneurial advantage over other nations." —President Obama #SIKE
@BarackObama This is what we got to hear after the verdict huh?
@BarackObama forget it Prez, there are too many lazy white racists that think immigrants are here to "steal what's theirs" to be heard.
@BarackObama Let's call it a latent advantage.  It CAN provide an entrepreneurial advantage, but that's not a given.  #ImmigrationAction
@BarackObama Legal immigration means best brain from around the world come to US. 
UR IMMIGRATION means TWISTED BRAIN COME over to ruin  US
@BarackObama امريكا بلاد عنصري
@BarackObama "Jim Crow" and his poseterity must move away from the USA. 
Some of us Americans were here BEFORE Jim and his family.
@BarackObama That's right...and YOU'RE destroying that entrepreneurial advantage!
@BarackObama groom the entreprenuers that are legal before we add to the bucket this one I can't go with you on
@BarackObama The majority of Americans are immigrants.  Some of us are "up from Slavery" Perhaps the truth of that fact will do much to help
@BarackObama unfortunately, being a nation of illiterate, narcissistic racists, doesn’t help much.
@BarackObama there's 12 million illegal immigrants that means there's 24 million lazy Americans that don't want to work
@BarackObama barack, today you can learn some from #presidentMas25N , don't copy us, #this_is_catalonia ! ||*||
@BarackObama but immigrants with a 2nd grade education are of no entrepreneurial advantage
@BarackObama Many people forget the US is a country built on the backs of immigrants. #GOP #Democrats
We are not a nation of immigrants, Mr. President. My Queen was overthrown to make room for your "entrepreneurial advantage".  @BarackObama
@runningnekkid I'm sorry you are erased. I see you.

Every time I hear that "Nation of Immigrants" bullshit, I hear this country does not want me, its indigenous daughter. @BarackObama
@BarackObama In Your opinion. You need to start asking people! I voted for you & now ashamed that I did.
@BarackObama Your immigration didn't help us much.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Mr. President, you know you respect the judiciary

@BarackObama That's the way. Yet not only a nation of immigrants gives entrepreneurship.
@BarackObama #PANTSUPDONTLOOT
