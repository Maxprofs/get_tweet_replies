@BarackObama Maybe you should read the GAO report that says it is costing US 1% of it's jobs.  You failed.
@BarackObama its far from perfect! BUT. More Americans insured than ever in our history! Congress:Build on it. Improve it!
@Skippsudduth @BarackObama Being insured is one thing but being covered is another.
@Alxandro @BarackObama Lordy I know! Me too! But till we can get Congress to pass single payer and get us what they've got gotta work w/this
@Skippsudduth @BarackObama Why blame Congress? Obama has a pen and a phone. I guess he only issues Executive Orders when it's convenient.
@Alxandro @Skippsudduth @BarackObama It's actually the SCOTUS's fault, & Obama for not allowing opinions to help improve. Typical-petulant O

@BarackObama  a candidate that mocks infirmity of a journalist or any fellow human being is unfit for a big job of US presidency.
@BarackObama Instead of looking for a rational and civilized candidate with wisdom, Republican chose money over wisdom and got DJ Trump.

@BarackObama millions don't want that coverage because it sucks
@BarackObama Families should not work at McDonals and call that a family supporting/living wage. Families should stay in school and get jobs
@BarackObama Dear president: Is this like the Medicare in US? Your country must  reform the social security system¡¡¡¡
@BarackObama Humm, kinda like introducing a new law that made millions lose theirs? Why reinvent the wheel?
@BarackObama DJ Trump has extremely low tolerance and emotional maturity to lead a great nation like US; better off as a bizman.
@BarackObama and insurance companies would lose billions
@BarackObama 2 million jobs . CBO. Lost because ego perches high and mighty
Thanks for all you´ve done. Really Donald Trump  there´s an bad candidate for  to address the destiny  of  country American.

@BarackObama
@BarackObama my daughter lost their health care, the state lowered the max income so now they don't qualify, scares me as a mom
@BarackObama  it's helping my family
@BarackObama stop blaming congress, defeat ISIS, close borders, pay off 18 TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT
@BarackObama if it wasn't for #Obamacare ..I would have no health insurance. I feel I'm on the verge of losing it, esp. if #TronaldDump wins
@BarackObama and what about the higher % of Americans that it's hurting? I have a friend paying more for Obamacare than her mortgage...
@BarackObama it's been a huge weight off my shoulder to find affordable, quality care after losing my job! Thanks. ”
@BarackObama Really Great and hopefully creates continuity! :) <3
@BarackObama I am an Obama supporter but not true cause I can't afford it and also can't afford the penalty I will receive soon. I am stuck
@BarackObama agreed.
@BarackObama yeah families who don't work!!! Your Healthcare is only good for lazy people!!! Welfare/Obamacare.
@BarackObama fact: not everyone needs government enforcement of insurance
@BarackObama when you write "Fact" and then the word "could" in a sentence you disprove "fact".
@BarackObama HAHAHA
You're so full of crap!
@BarackObama we already can't afford to go to the doctor under your plan. We were fine before obamacare. How can it get worse?
@BarackObama No, it means America has a fighting chance to get out of debt. Nobody can afford Obamacare. Sorry bro.
@BarackObama  can we make so the cost quit going sky high
@BarackObama millions of people who are taking advantage to get rx drugs to resale on the black market won't be able to either. For shame
@BarackObama thanks to Obamacare premiums are through the roof. Who'd have thought an ins. co. would take advantage bc they could. Duh!
@BarackObama heaven forbid the American people have the freedom to choose. Because they're too stupid to know what's more beneficial
@BarackObama nice having insurance, but not when monthly payments keep rising so high.
@BarackObama Mr Obama! Why dont you have Obamacare for health insurance?
@BarackObama

@BarackObama more BS
@BarackObama no it isn't. It is too expensive.
@BarackObama Keeping it many more will lose coverage.
@BarackObama U really helped   12K deductibles &60 co-pays double premiums
@BarackObama GOP says it's not the guns, it's the mental illness. But then they wanna take healthcare away, too? so crazy guns it is! Wheee!
@BarackObama millions are losing coverage because of your reform
@BarackObama my premiums doubled along with my deductible so thanks great work you liar
@BarackObama  They've lost coverage anyway if the deductibles and premiums are to high.  I say, let's repeal Obamacare and start over.
@BarackObama REPEAL IT NOW !!
@BarackObama It may be helping millions but it's also hurting millions. It's also hurting the Doctors. It just wasn't well thought out.
@BarackObama who gives a shit, they don't pay for it anyways WE DO! SCUMBAG!
@BarackObama Devastating?  Oh yeah, its devastating to the folks that have to pay for it.
@BarackObama It may be helping millions but on who's dollar is it helping?
@BarackObama Repealing the Affordable Health Care may now make it truly affordable...
@BarackObama So, we find out as we expected we would that your plan was a crapper, let others make offers now.
@BarackObama Hey! Now, maybe you will listen to OTHERS that may have better ideas concerning health care.
@BarackObama Obama president muhammad buhari is a bako haram terrorist beware
@BarackObama @JonathanJewel DOWN WITH OBAMACARE: SCOURGE OF THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS.
@BarackObama. Losing my insurance because of the aca. Can't afford your so called affordable health care. Thanks for lying.
@BarackObama In a country of 350+ million, that were already paying for everything else utilized by the Extortion Class, this is the end.
@BarackObama  , no worries my man, democratic party landslide is coming next November
@BarackObama Didn't help me. Working hard to get a good job got my insurance
@BarackObama Well that is okay because you took mine away and now have nothing go figure
@BarackObama millions already have had cancelled policies under it...
@BarackObama Odumbocare is costing us millions in higher deductibles and costs and insurance companies going out of Odumbocare
@BarackObama As someone who works at a pharmacy, Obamacare has really high deductibles, and it's not always helping people enough..
@BarackObama Obamacare is itself on life support.  Let it die and good riddance. The road to health is to keep YOU out of the people's purse
@BarackObama as we have always said, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, so we all want the same thing: health!
@BarackObama SALAM UN ALAIKUM. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE WORLD NOT ONLY FOR USA. ALLAH HAFIZ.
@BarackObama your presidency is devastating to the country
@BarackObama And it's costing us millions! IDIOT.
@BarackObama And thank you for ACA!
@BarackObama My husband who is diabetic is picking his plan today, first time in three years he'll have health care. Protect ACA!

@BarackObama They can't afford obamaso-called-care coverage, nitwit.
@BarackObama hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaqhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahqahahgahahahgahahhaqhjahjaq
@BarackObama If Repealed Fight Back !
@BarackObama I just can't understand why the lowest plan available to me is $183/Month. It's not affordable for a lot of people my age.
@BarackObama I love paying other people's way in life
@BarackObama thanks for obamacare.  Every year since its started my out of pocket maximums have doubled to help pay for the bloodsuckers
@BarackObama Proud of you Mr President!!!
@BarackObama you should not penalized those that can't afford it!!
@BarackObama Obamacare shouldn't be repealed. It should be defunded!
@BarackObama Obama's ego will not allow him to admit his ACA is falling apart & it was poorly executed costing millions to taxpayers!!
@BarackObama Not like you'd be reading this but wish the reporting aspect of it was easier for employers. It's a burden for HR people.
@BarackObama signing up this week I need coverage 
@BarackObama Wrong.  I will vote for ANYBODY that promises to repeal it.  It sucks.
@BarackObama lol this is like the refinance for veterans that still require good credit no late payments it's garbage
@BarackObama Obamacare is broke... but you knew that when you went into this.  The providers are pulling out because it doesn't work.
@BarackObama the republicans has long abandoned parliamentary politics. They are a bunch of sociopaths who cares only about their interest !
.@BarackObama think of the votes democrats would lose. It would be devastating.
@BarackObama it's to expensive
@BarackObama Keep the restrictions on predatory practices by insurance companies, scrap the rest. You rushed &  failed the American people.
@BarackObama Don't worry, their ACA network is so small they essentially have no coverage anyway. Or high deductible. Or shoddy coverage.
@BarackObama it needs to be fixed
@BarackObama Rocks as President.
@BarackObama well why r u and congress exempt from this disaster insurance ? U can keep ur doctor and wait save money .
@BarackObama ...?
@BarackObama It's a total train wreck.  #FullRepeal
@BarackObama hell no.obummercare is less coverage, more costly than what was before you and your attempt to control Americans, that you hate
@BarackObama you're right, elimination will be devastating to most families.
@BarackObama - it has helped me so much, I can't thank you enough.  My premiums have doubled, so now I drop life insurance to cover it!
@BarackObama Now-AttentionWorldLeaders;I'm back...@WhiteHouse @washingtonpost @NHSEnglandLDN @KremlinRussia_E @FRANCE24 @SethMacF @guardian
@BarackObama enacting it is a violation of every American's individual rights.
@BarackObama thank you for your excellence in everything you do. I so admire you and your family!

@BarackObama cuanto anhelo tener alas y llevando a mi familia en  mi regazo volar a  donde hay esperanzas. A su país de oportunidades :(
@BarackObama just stop. Stop. It DOES NOT WORK.
@BarackObama   We know indeed Mr. President. Get your pen ready.  We got you...
@BarackObama How do you fell that your a puppet by your donators!
@BarackObama bah humbug Obamacare is a failure and costs are rising every day
@BarackObama Merry Christmas!
@BarackObama Not true. Everyone had healthcare in the past. UnitedHealthcare backing out -- can't afford Obamacare.
@BarackObama   GOT IT?
@BarackObama Obama hung out with radical Communist student groups while in college and liked radicals who hate this country all his life!
@BarackObama his real name is Barry L soetoro, and his father was a radical communist from Kenya! One of the many reasons he hates America!
@BarackObama hey Barry!! That is your real name isn't it!? Why don't you tell everybody when you changed it to barrack! After you converted
@BarackObama
@BarackObama it also means I don't have to pay for everyone else. #Obamacaresucks #killsocialism
@BarackObama I'd rather pay the fine, it will be more affordable. #Obama Care sucks
@BarackObama it's not,  people can't afford it's rise.  Don't imposed it ,you have forgotten that America is a democratic country.
@BarackObama another Syrian child mistakes a photographers camera for a weapon and raises her hands to surrender
@BarackObama Surely.
@BarackObama Just because someone has signed up doesn't mean they are being cared for.
@BarackObama it is a nonsense It is like going back to prehistory
@BarackObama I want to be President.

@BarackObama that what happen when we elect republican to congress. wake up people!!!!!
@BarackObama This is #Bullshit! Who can afford $600p/mo+$4000 deductible OOP. If you have a job, u have no idea what u're talking abt
@BarackObama  Why the Republicans do not want this for the people is a disgrace, everyone deserves to have medical coverage !!!
@BarackObama If it hadn't been for the affordable care act I may not be alive today. Thank you President Obama!!
@BarackObama  I totally agree, allowing people to have medical coverage is the best thing you could have done for the American people.
