@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Stop Supporting Murders Generals in Egypt
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Equal Pay day was back in 1963. Why can't your administration EVER enforce the laws on the books? Lazy? Incompetent?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS we don't need a monument we need a better paycheck
@WhiteHouse @SenSchumer @POTUS How will that look inside? What is the point of a building monument?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS plss click this page http://GoPaidbiWeekly.com/index.php?ref=18734 … thanks :D
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Monuments are nice, but a monument won't feed nor clothe any woman, especially one that's head of household. Pay them!!!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS yes. There have to be equally between  us.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Now if more money could be placed in our salaries! # equality in the workplace.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS What's this costing us, the taxpayers? How much territory are the Feds actually taking over, the entire neighborhood?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS   Very simple...equal pay for equal work....$15hr for everyone...BHO socialism policy
@WhiteHouse @POTUS kiss my monument
@WhiteHouse @POTUS

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS نبي اجازة
@WhiteHouse @terri_georgia @POTUS Men will be charged 33% more for entry than women. GOP registers a complaint for free trade admission.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS A new monument! Oh boy! As a women I'm so thrilled that you're doing this instead of focusing on the actual problem!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I see your national monument and raise you reparations. #EqualPayDay
@WhiteHouse @POTUS #NYPrimary #NY

This is the year of the woman! @HillaryClinton will be elected President to finalize the #RealRevolution!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS a monument?? Really?? Ugh...political masturbation. Just close the damn pay gap.
@PateVicky @WhiteHouse @POTUS They cannot, sadly, because there is no such thing.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS USA seriously needs #EqualCrimeEqualPunishment. 98% of female criminals get lesser punishment than men for same crimes.
@WhiteHouse@POTUS 
Cleaning continues. ! Thx..
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Hope the new national monument is a new national prison where women are given same punishment as men for same crimes.
.@WhiteHouse How about a monument to the brutality of Islam on women? Here's a model for the statue. @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS سلام...
@WhiteHouse @POTUS That's wonderful - now please close the pay gap
@_michaelhughes1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS it exists due to job choice the only way to close it is to take away choice of job
@sneakyblackhat @WhiteHouse @POTUS I call bullshit. No excuse for paying women .78 for every dollar a man makes regardless of job
@WhiteHouse @POTUS How much is that going to cost tax payers?  As a woman I would rather not pay for one. Get it donated or ditch it.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS let women pay for that bs
@TutuMahasin @WhiteHouse @POTUS summer road trip?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS rich women need to make more money this cannot be denied
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS Yeah, designate a monument instead of doing what you say ppl should do
http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/04/14/war-women-obama-democrats-equal-pay-column/7670105/ …
On #EqualPayDay, @POTUS will designate a new national monument honoring women’s equality: http://go.wh.gov/Belmont-Paul
