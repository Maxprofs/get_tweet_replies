No thanks to BHO, thanks to the oil private sector that brought oil down. 

@nikbardoni @BarackObama
The world is definitely not a safer place, unless you live in a peaceful  imaginary liberal world. 

@nikbardoni
@Antoun_AA so @BarackObama is responsible for the entire world safety? Oil comp. and private sec are to be thanked? Didn't get policy help?
Oh yeah I saved the best for last. 

Obamacare, 
welfare 
unemployment 

Now scram with your liberal uninformed bad self 

@nikbardoni
@Antoun_AA unemployment is down to 5.8% last check from 12% #movingintherightdirection
Check the real unemployment num. It's down because people stopped looking for work and they are not factored in. Get informed
