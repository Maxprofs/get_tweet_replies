LOL, from HIS poor decisions? It was the gov shutdown brought to you by the GOP that lowered the rating
The shutdown falls under "broken political system". Bail out was under the Bush admin!
then why do we owe $19 trillion dollars does the president think we are stupid or is he just stupid? R/T
jerry the uninformed believe his bullshit
yea i see what your problem is
@BarackObama @POTUS please be sure to explain the difference between the deficit and national debt.
@kevincorke @POTUS Then why has the national debt more than doubled in your eight years
D.J.,  learn the difference between debt and deficit!
Yeah deficit leads to more debt, which has more than doubled in the last 7.5 years.
Would have nearly tripled on the previous path!
What kind of sick joke is this. Reduced our debt??? Did I miss something??
You sure did. It's deficit not debt!
Thanks.
how about jobs that star at more than $9 an hour and have benefits Mr. President
Fact check! @BarackObama proposed numerous jobs bills all rejected by the GOP!
Of course they shrank.  After they were inflated to record levels due to bailout programs
No! Two wars that we are still paying for inflated the deficit!
we still owe 18 trillion
economists worry about a country's ability to pay, so % of GDP is used as a measure.
@BarackObama @POTUS which means our government is still spending more than they take in. Debt is still climbing just slower.
@HeyIrish @POTUS Ignorant Trump voters
@BarackObama @POTUS deficit cut in half???? How about the $9 Trillion Dropped On The National Debt?
@BarackObama @POTUS lol
@BarackObama @POTUS But what about the *cough* debt?
@BarackObama @POTUS ha ha ha ha ha ha are you kidding me. You're really going to try and pass this off. ha ha ha ha ha
@BarackObama @POTUS hahahahahahahahahahahahaha  ha.
@BarackObama  I guess that's why our National debt has GROWN by an ADDITIONAL 8 TRILLION in that same time period. Explain that
then why do we still have 19 trillion in debt. Pols need to stop printing money and treat it like we treat our household
People,take some advanced Econ.We can easily cut the debt & deficits, in parallel the $ skyrockets, exports dump and jobs vanish
@BarackObama @POTUS life a piece of cake when you pay all your bills with a credit card
@BarackObama @POTUS where'd it go ?  Oh  the debt is 20 trillion   there it is
@BarackObama @POTUS we are 20 trillion in debt and there are zero jobs in my industry. Worst economic president ever. Period.
lol
#delusional #smokeandmirrors #fallicy Probably too late for@POTUS to start telling the truth #betteroffbashingtrump
@LeaKThompson @POTUS uhhh BS Obama blows.  Vacationed for 8 yrs and hasn't fulfilled half his promises
if GDP increases the percentage of our deficit decreases, but the actual deficit be the same.  #BoycottTarget
@erikwill @POTUS  I guess when you remove shelter and food from inflation stats, you get FAKE numbers!
I've been proud of my Commander in Chief! Nice to see real data
@BarackObama @POTUS 
I'm sure all your lefty friends believe that.
Ask U.S. AND THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS. 
U IGNENT !
@BarackObama @POTUS #MoreLies
@BarackObama @POTUS Dear MR Obama, Thank you for your service,inspiration and intelligence. I know the plan was for you to fail.
@deg2 @POTUS actually the GEO office records show exact opposite. Also states heading for second recession.
@BarackObama @POTUS -you are to blame nobody else. @HillaryClinton would do same. @realDonaldTrump
@BarackObama @POTUS Percent of GDP? doesn't matter as idiots who voted for you have zero clue about how deficits are calculated.
@BarackObama @POTUS Are you f'ing kidding us??  The national debt is DOUBLE what it was when you were elected.  #idiot
@BarackObama @POTUS That's an outright lie about deficits cut under Obama. Good thing those people don't believe in Heaven/Hell!
@BarackObama @POTUS So.full.of.crap. #POSPOTUS
divert divid & destroy. Thanks Obama.
@BarackObama @POTUS I think your solar calculator is broken! Must have been made by Solyndra! 
Which means jack squat given how much they rose shortly before he was elected, it also doesn't change the fact the
national debt under Obama is worse than under Bush
Fuzzy math. 
Just because private industry made more money doesn't mean you get credit. Percent per shment 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@BarackObama @POTUS bull tiki!
: @GOP : smell the coffee
We still owe 19.3 Trillion. What's up with that? It isn't money we owe ourselves anymore. We can end up like Brazil did.
Dont use GDP. Use #'s Americans understand. Tell us how much you all budgeted vs. how much you all went over budget.
@kevincorke @POTUS and I didn't get to keep my doctor, plan or health insurance.
I hope people don't believe this
@gmukunda @POTUS WELL, why don't you @Harvard elites put Jan 20, 2009 in that first little box http://treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current  and CLICK
Well the budget for 2009 was the one passed by the previous President...
Where do u see "BUDGET" in any of that an this old man heard you teach...Lord, @Harvard is n deep sh!!
You do understand that the amount of any given deficit is a product of the budget? That's what budget means.
U do understand the total US TOTAL DEBT from Jan 8, 1835 till the end of 1975 went from $0.00 to less than $550 billion.
and there has never been a balance "budget" in the 90's because the DEBT on Americans by its GOV has gone UP every year since 1930
@LeaKThompson @POTUS GREAT!!!!!!!!!
@kevincorke @POTUS Debt has grown by 81% during same period
@BarackObama @POTUS there's another great billboard,  tv ad, Internet ad for @BarackObama and @TheDemocrats
@BarackObama @POTUS 
http://tozenews247.blogspot.nl/2016/06/jay-z-finally-respond-to-pundit-who.html?m=1 …
@BarackObama  Oh what BS this is. It's just the opposite
@BarackObama @POTUS INCREASED THE DEFICIT MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT IN HISTORY!
Liars. How do you explain $19 trillion deficit that exploded under YOUR leadership?
thank you with all of my heart sad its almost over...
laughable ... $19.3 TRILLION in debt ... $500 BILLION annual deficits ... and POTUS is proud?
@LeaKThompson @POTUS ah as a percentage of GDP not in actual cash terms. This is how most dodgy accountants cook the books.
economy grew by 1.4% in 2015 & borrowing as a % of GDP came down by 0.3% which suggests borrowing increased
many prefer data in cash terms for a more realistic picture.
u can borrow $10t every year for a decade & the deficit will fall as a % of GDP as long as u have growth.
you're still borrowing/spending not earned leaving the country exposed when the next crash comes & it will.
"In God we trust" Deficit Cut 75% OK-What About"TRUST Deficit" in Global Village Due2 Drones Attacks-Refugees Increasing?
80% of the time I'm right every time.
what's the actual dollar value of the deficit? Add that to your tax payer funded info-graph.
If President Clinton's policies had been continued, we would now be debt free.
@BarackObama @POTUS 
Posterity will celebrate you...if politics n other variables blind the current generation from appreciating
@BarackObama @POTUS    Too bad you have not touched the debt.
@BarackObama @POTUS You triple spending your first year in office then take credit for cutting it? #GTFO
Isn't reducing the deficit the first priority for reducing the national debt, like in triage stopping the bleeding is #1?
yea, there almost down to where the were when you took office.  Cant say that for the Debt though!!
It will get better if we stay on course. Great job Mr. President, and all those that believed in you.
@BarackObama @POTUS bullshit fake asf numbers. You stopped growing and lost tons of it
you are a liar!!! DBN lier
@BarackObama @POTUS bogus numbers like a bogus president God I can't wait for you to leave
Not the entire picture.  Look at the over all credit card balance since you came into office and now.  Not a good pic.
@BarackObama @POTUS  then why are we 20 trillion in debt? More than every prior president combined? Let's see you spin this!
LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO INCREASE OUR NATIONAL DEBT SINCE YOU TOOK OFFICE! YOU MUST BE DELUSIONAL OR INCOMPETENT! 
@DumpTrump7 @POTUS I love our president. F the haters!
Huh, the debt has increased by $10 trillion during that same period.  Funny how you can skew a cart to you favor
@BarackObama @POTUS We reduced new debt each year. But the total debt is still accumulating as we speak.
A % of a % may not be ideal. Here's the whole story. Partisans, destroy each other in 3-2-1...
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE DEBT!!!
common core math?
@BarackObama @POTUS Problem is you're still upside down even without a war.
@BarackObama @POTUS  Good job indeed....that's what i'm talking about...
@BarackObama @POTUS that's the way to spin it. Forget our 'debt' has increased I patriotically by 10 trillion all by ur lonesome
@LeaKThompson @POTUS if you believe that I have some swamp land I can sell you lol
@BarackObama @POTUS   18 billion $ is not lowering of the debt
Thank you Mr. President!
@BarackObama @POTUS רק דונלד טרמאפ לנשיאות ארה"ב אובמה הנשיא לך הביתה
@BarackObama @POTUS what the heck how can this be
So deceitful!!!
well we still have a deficit! #realdonaldtrump
@BarackObama @POTUS Do you truly believe your own bullshit? Really!
it's a fact, do the math yourself. What the gov is spending vs borrowing, and u have the number.
It is about time that POTUS has showed what he has done to improve the country - in many area. Now is the time to do so
deficit and debt are different . The deficit is the relationship of the dollars worth of exports vs imports
@BarackObama @POTUS how about that 19 trillion national debt?
@BarackObama  thank you !
Ya thanks for giving away our hard earned  to Wall Street!Trillions more debt than other POTUS!
@BarackObama @POTUS that's ridiculous. The national debt has doubled
@BarackObama @POTUS thank you @POTUS
Deficit reduction, not debt reduction. Budget has to get balanced (0 deficit), to stop adding to accumulated debt.
@BarackObama @POTUS The deficit is different than the national debt. Obama is using language to fool the uneducated masses.
@BarackObama @POTUS a bullshit stat, tax revenue is at an all time high, next!
ya like unemployment is under 5% Obama is a joke!
@BarackObama @POTUS not to mention this is result of #Congress taking action with sequestration! Way to take credit #Losers
@BarackObama @POTUS what the hell? The national debt is almost at 20 trillion! Are you all smoking crack at the White House?
@BarackObama @POTUS ...so?
I guess when you start at over $1 TRILLION you can me this look good.
oh well then. Time to put a Republican back in the White House to increase the debt again.
This is a misleading chart. You can't solve a problem by pretending there isn't one. Annual expenses exceed revenues.
@BarackObama @POTUS Obama tho 
@BarackObama @POTUS you still DOUBLED the debt incurred by 43 previous presidents in less than 8 years.
what about reducing the entire balance, Iaccoca...
@BarackObama 
Delusional, deceitful, lies, manipulated data... whatever. But truthful, not on your lives!
@BarackObama @POTUS all this for just casting 2 votes.  Life is good.
@BarackObama @POTUS
@BarackObama @POTUS if only we could have 4 more years, but alas election laws and stuff
