@BarackObama WOW, I'm not American, but you had me in tears, I would put my life in your hands anytime anywhere, you unite sir, bravo! #SOTU
@Bjamin1776 oh please, tell me one thing he's done to make you feel divided? I suppose you would choose the bigot Trump? lol
@Bjamin1776 race batting?Come on, it certainly doesn't come from him altho I think a large part of the country are racist towards him.
@Bjamin1776 and this is exactly what he has been trying to do for years now, too bad the senate playing politics vetos all his efforts.
@BarackObama Huh I thought it depended on the Constitution you swore an oath to uphold and defend.  We don't work for you,  you work for us
@wobble0351 The constitution was written based on a representative democracy. In order for ANY president 2 uphold it, WE HAVE TO PARTICIPATE
@Arielle_Cee they no longer represent us
@wobble0351 well then who's fault is that? OURS. there's an election every two years you know. So again, like Obama said, participate.
@BarackObama @JovanniTricerri yes! I knew our President would win you over eventually!

@BarackObama the problem is I think with the money and the power make them forget that they are citizens like us.
@theCitizenx88 @BarackObama This is why ALL politicians (including House, Senate AND Supreme Court) should have term limits...corruption!
@FreeSpiritInKS @BarackObama no I definitely believe @POTUS should be able to go another term.
@theCitizenx88 @BarackObama @POTUS We have presidential term limits to avoid dictatorship. It's built in for a valid reason.
@FreeSpiritInKS @BarackObama @POTUS I understand that,  but if it's what people want why not?
@theCitizenx88 @BarackObama @POTUS Because in truth, not all of the people want it, and we should make no exceptions for any party's leader.
@BarackObama Wait a minute... You're not really tweeting this yourself, are you?
