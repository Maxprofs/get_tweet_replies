@BarbraStreisand What % of that 97% (a disproven number anyway) are funded by government grants? 95? 98? 99?
@rshackelford14 Government grants are irrelevant. FACTS ARE FACTS. Incorrect information cannot pass peer review.
@niallcpc Please see the University of East Anglia re: peer reviews and how honest this science has been. Standing by..
@rshackelford14 What about climate change do you dispute?
@niallcpc Still haven't had anyone explain to me how the same people warning of imminent global cooling in the 70's have credibility today.
@rshackelford14 Your ignorance/arrogance is laughable. I'll leave you to your conspiracies. http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/now-just-001-percent-of-climate-scientists-reject-global-warming …
@niallcpc You say conspiracies, I say actual, factual quotes from the first Earth Day in the 70's.. but whatevs..
@rshackelford14 If you want to take 'facts' 45 years old versus present day 99% concensus, I am happy to leave you be 
@SpeedyVarmint @BarbraStreisand @BarackObama We are changing the climate already.The arrogance is in ignoring evidence and failing to act.
@SpeedyVarmint @BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Reduce carbon emissions, switch us much as possible to renewable energy, take more.....
@SpeedyVarmint @BarbraStreisand @BarackObama ....personal responsibility about the energy we use.
@SpeedyVarmint @BarbraStreisand @BarackObama The alternative being what?Shrug,admit we fucked up, and let the next generation deal with it?
@BarbraStreisand @RBJRON Really? Funny how the National Atmospheric BS Board just announced THIS WEEK that they had cooked the numbers!
@jkaccinni @BarbraStreisand Oh! I see, so it's OK to keep trashing the planet and pumping out pollution into that atmosphere?
@RBJRON @BarbraStreisand I didn't say that. Just reporting news. But allow some more truth. http://www.thefederalistpapers.org/world/disgrace-more-countries-caught-lying-about-global-warming …
@jkaccinni @BarbraStreisand Granted sum changes may not B attributable to man but there is a need to clean up our own mess& do things better
@RBJRON @BarbraStreisand Agreed. I wish they would start with deforestation and the destruction it causes 2 wildlife & R atmosphere.
@jkaccinni @BarbraStreisand Whole heartedly agree about deforestation & especially killing animals 2 have as some trophy hanging on the wall
@RBJRON @BarbraStreisand U & I are on the same page, there!! Ppl seem to have lost respect for our planet & other life of all kind.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama
@BarbraStreisand the scientific method requires evidence Barbra. What are the  sources for the 97% figure?
@BarbraStreisand @juancanavarro never let facts get in the way of a narrative http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136 …
@BarbraStreisand help them get in the White House! Trump made a fool out of himself. Disrespectful to all women who interview him.
@BarbraStreisand sick planned parenthood issue made me sick. A man who is on a mission to take away women's rights! Angering!

@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama when all or that many scientists agree on something, be worried. 100% at one time agreed the earth was flat.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama and I believe that Climate Change is real btw.
@andrewmugoya @BarbraStreisand @BarackObama it IS real!! Common sense should tell everyone what's happening.. Dems 2016!!!!!

@BarbraStreisand its also time people stop manipulating the climate by using chemicals blasted out of airplane wings causing #chemtrails
@BarbraStreisand @ZimmermanRob then tell Hollywood to park jets,sell mansions. Maybe Moochelle could park her jet
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama stick to singing. Its an act of deception to tax citizens for a fraudulant study. Even talented ppl get fooled
@BarbraStreisand From the WSJ saying the "97% Scientist Agree on climate change is a MYTH."  Good to do research. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136 …
@BarbraStreisand Better check a bunch of other sites Barb. That one study has been refuted. Raw satellite data shows cooling for past 18yrs!
@BarbraStreisand truth about his lies. He's not even worth $10bill..he's got about $1bill.. Even Fox declared that!
@BarbraStreisand they'll wake up..this will be a shoe in for the Democrats! Can't wait to volunteer my time & add money & raise money to

@BarbraStreisand too bad 100% of the "T"errorist Party in Congress believe they know better and are the ones who make the decisions.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Only because they silence any scientists who disagree.

@BarbraStreisand Google "owning the weather by 2025" and see what you find
@BarbraStreisand climate change is a pack of lies to push agenda 21 which is an evil, corporate plan to reduce industry and population.
@BarbraStreisand ask the criminal government about metal particulate spraying from commercial and other jets.
@barbrastreisand we can feel n see it.
@BarbraStreisand but most politicians listen to the crowd and dummys. Even scientists need inspiration from abroad. So I did lecture at MIT.
@BarbraStreisand quiet barbs, nobody cares what u think #washedup #knowyourrole

Well, let's talk about the main causers of the last 25 years @BarbraStreisand @BarackObama. Hypocritical #ActOnClimate #US
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama climate change has occurred since the world began.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Weird facade going on here. Mr. Obama retweets but still allows Shell to drill in the arctic
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama if climate change didn't happen North America would still be covered with ice
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama I agree, but big money
doesn't .
@BarbraStreisand .i love you from north africa.

@BarbraStreisand Did You know that animal agriculture / meat industry is climate cause No.1 ?
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Notice they don't say 97% of all scientists. It's a select 97% and plenty of others disagree.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama  Google what scientists were "sure" about back when they started "Earth Day" the % of error is astounding
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Her suggestion may be of little value, but you should discuss it all the same.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama this must be a 10-year old tweet that resurfaced. Do something,people with power,we already act where "we can"
I trust scientists who actually practice the Scientific Method,
not change data to fit their pre-conceived beliefs!

@BarbraStreisand I helped a man who recently passed away. he remembered you fondly, before you were who you are today. He was Gino Giglio.

@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama creo que de todos modos ya es tarde,aun así  no paran de dañar a la naturaleza.Que pena.......
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama science fiction
@BarbraStreisand what do you use to get such beathiful hair?
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama 97%? Do you even know where you got that number from? If you want to help the climate, get your numbers right.

@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Problem is, too many morons in this stupid country.
@BarbraStreisand climate change is bs
Please educate yourself @BarbraStreisand before spouting off #Hoax #ActOnClimate @BarackObama
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Yet the media focusses on the other 3%. Wonder why. Love to the greatest living pop singer.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama as the science is "settled" I presume you can withdraw all research grants from the climate scientists....

.@BarbraStreisand U R such a great actor, so, how can we tell U R not acting, now, about acting on #Climate? @BarackObama #CdnPoli #Science
@BarbraStreisand those numbers are fake. People contribute 0 % to any climate change. It just goes on and on.
@BarbraStreisand #ActOnClimate the time to act was 40 years ago!!!
@djohara @BarbraStreisand Oh no 40 years ago they were warning of an ice age
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Please help us stop the British government from using bee killing pesticides on farms. This is urgent. Thanks.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama Its air traffic, notice it got hotter when air traffic increased. The next ice age will correct all.
@BarbraStreisand we are the only contributor.. animals are going instinct.
“@BarbraStreisand: 97% of scientists agree, climate change is real and humans are a significant contributor. It’s time to #ActOnClimate”
@barbrastreisand @barackobama It is changing due to the contribution of developed countries.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama what will be will be according to the bible
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama The remaining 3% of scientists are brought to you by Koch Industries.
@BarbraStreisand @BarackObama I think you'll find that the USA is the biggest contributor
