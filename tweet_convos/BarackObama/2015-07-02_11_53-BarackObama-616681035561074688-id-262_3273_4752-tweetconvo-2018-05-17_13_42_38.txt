@BarackObama Honorable president thank you very much for your support with gangs in Denver....much love
@BarackObama @RCatatumb Happy 4 of july and save venezuela of comunist
@BarackObama And inner-city public schools are underfunded.
@troyisMAJOR @BarackObama visit rural area schools.  Inner city schools have way better facilities and funds than many of ours in TN!
@ohheyhayl Why are you shaping this into a competition of the worst? All students deserve better facilities.
@troyisMAJOR Innercity schools around here have the latest technology, state of the art schools, my school has neither of the two.
@BarackObama WAY underdpaid!!!
@BarackObama agree with you mister president but what can we do to make it right?
@BarackObama @DessyDimanova Nunca tanto como en Chile!
@BarackObama this is pam amos i want to talk to you about my irs tax refund i have been put thur the ringer with not getting my tax refund
@barackobama Subs don't get extra coverage for covering other classes either.  Now subs have to pay for their own insurance, out of pocket.
@BarackObama Thanks for the support!
@BarackObama cut funding to our enemies and illegals and pay teachers more.
@BarackObama I truly wish the teachers would get more pay. I see their love for work declining. It's horrible for teaching our children.
@barackobama Totally agree.  Substitute teachers are underpaid as well. Substitutes in Milwaukee Public Schools don't get sick leave anymore
@BarackObama hi Mr. President, how are you?
@BarackObama Yes, yes I am. We all are. Not that you actually care.
@BarackObama @MiaFarrow Not to mention under-respected. Maybe you should check with one or two of us the next time you want a new curriculum
@BarackObama @stephengpeters thank you, Mr. President!   I knew I liked you.
@BarackObama @stephengpeters Amen
@BarackObama well half r in uneducated to even teach !!
@BarackObama By the way, your state teachers can always join the private posh religious system for vocational happiness if they r underused
@BarackObama The best president of dz world
@BarackObama Uganda is even worse
@BarackObama and now the SCOTUS is going to take away their collective bargaining rights. That'll be a bad day for USA workers.

Yes. Yes we are. "@BarackObama: "And by the way, our teachers are underpaid." —President Obama”
@BarackObama @Eykis AND BTW, YOU HELP REPUBLICANS GUT TEACHER'S UNIONS... HYPOCRITE!
@BarackObama @Eykis If you cared you & Arne Duncan wouldn't have helped Republicans privatize & gut public edu & destroy teacher's unions!
@BarackObama @Marmel Its because Republicans don't like to invest in the future, and democrats do not hammer them for it.
@BarackObama @Freefree0Bobbie R U going to get overtime
“@BarackObama: "And by the way, our teachers are underpaid." —President Obama”
@BarackObama amen to that.
@BarackObama @rcarr57 Anytime somebody says it's not about money, you can bet it's about money.
@tomerous @BarackObama Our teachers are seriously underpaid. Our public schools have been robbed by charter schools which are worse.
@BarackObama Please stop the war on our public education system. Union busting & standardized tests are not helping students or teachers.
@BarackObama preach! Teachers in the US are woefully underpaid!
@BarackObama Amen!
@BarackObama @_DrewSchroeder lol
@BarackObama You have done a great job
@BarackObama that seems to be the case in more countries...
@BarackObama @DavidHollister2 that's about the smartest thing he's said since being in office!! 
@BarackObama As an Australian teacher, it was sad to meet US teachers having to hold down second job to survive. We must value education.
@BarackObama If their  Students have sense of Gratitude They Will Not Hold back from Helping Their Revered Teachers.
@BarackObama Aren't most teachers in most countries underpaid sir?
@BarackObama h
@BarackObama YES THEYARE!!!
@BarackObama the same problem in germany. Great job Mister President
@BarackObama @FourthGrStudio  finally some one recognizes that teachers deserve better!
@BarackObama right again
@BarackObama Sure, teachers deserve better pay. And if you want to improve educational outcomes, give them more time to collaborate.
@BarackObama yes we are underpaid  (teachers)
@BarackObama Teachers should never b overpaid.People should choose teaching 4 the love of it rather than as a money making opportunity(MMO).
@BarackObama @JanetSchultz4 @beckysteele AMEN AM I RIGHT FOLKS
@_bbrandonnn @BarackObama @JanetSchultz4 AMEN!
@BarackObama yes we are
@BarackObama yes they should be making six figures
@BarackObama TY sir. We teachers are also compensated with satisfaction of doing what matters & doing it well & that means the world to me.
@BarackObama AMEM!!
@BarackObama You can't just state the obvious  and have it be true. It's like saying "free thousand dollar bills (just print em') for all"!
@BarackObama Will print some more money and pay them that's exactly how the economy works. Sure it is.
@BarackObama If you remind teachers how great you are they will certainly pass it on to all of the students good one king!
@BarackObama no shit, stating the obvious certainly rallies the  the troops. This president tweets too much!
“@BarackObama: "And by the way, our teachers are underpaid." —President Obama”. I won't disagree...
@BarackObama inner city schools receive nearly twice the amount of suburban schools! Problem is parent involvement
@BarackObama @12stepmama Why is this an after thought? #theproblemwithourcountry
Say this a LOT LOUDER!  RT @BarackObama: "And by the way, our teachers are underpaid." —President Obama
@BarackObama by the way, you're overpaid
@BarackObama yes they are
@BarackObama I hope this means you'll do something about it. Teachers should be some off the highest paid workers out there.
@BarackObama I sing this song, too.
@BarackObama Underpaid teacher buried by student loan debt needs relief from one end or the other! Still love teaching!
@BarackObama sure are! & their 401k investments perpetuate their underpayment!  
@BarackObama um you think?  Teachers are grossly underpaid.  Such a shame.
@BarackObama high increments in the salaries for teachers could be limited by the multiplier effect. There're many teachers.
@BarackObama 
Pretty sure when they go to collage they are aware of the wages they will make,just as Nurses,Dr.s,Massage Therapists,Hairdsgn
