@BarackObama Do you even Economics, bro?
@JTGilgo @BarackObama  Tens of Millions of our min. wage citizens literally go hungry. If you're against raising wages, you're FOR poverty
@KnaubBilly @JTGilgo @BarackObama You sir do not live on Planet Reality. I've worked for min. wages ALL my life. Your solutions unrealistic!
@KnaubBilly @JTGilgo @BarackObama  Not sure what your point was here? What do animals have to do with lifting Americans out of poverty?
@KnaubBilly @JTGilgo @BarackObama   1st step: voting on 4th Nov. Getting rid of EVERYTHING? That's a child's answer. U can do better.
@BarackObama @mrdavidj The only Americans against raising are rich employers & republicans who think they're too good to work for min. wage
@BarackObama Worked 7 days a week, no vacations. Had to choose between food & antibiotics, almost died. Minimum wages cause REAL SUFFERING
@barackobama That's Economy 101 by the way, and not the collection of stupidities known as Reaganomics that brought this mess. @steegvan
@MacJuanma Such a shame that Basic economics was so perverted by such obvious propaganda! We may have been innundated but wedidnthav2believe
@steegvan We've all been somehow hypnotized by those idiots. In Europe too, through Reagan's pal: Margaret Thatcher.
@MacJuanma Amazing just havin some1 in Auth. say something stupid & no1 checks the facts!?Unless it doesnt help corporations!
@steegvan The script, speech & propaganda from Corporate America & Friedman folks was very well prepared. Reagan just performed as an actor.
@MacJuanma What kills me is he was a Lousy actor!, but paid media had their scripts too, & rest is unfortunate history.
@steegvan Of course, corporate owned media was complice of all the lies and swindles.
@BarackObama and the goverment will make more in taxes
@BarackObama They'll *have* to, in order to buy things after companies inflate prices to keep their bottom line intact.
@BarackObama @moderate2severe Thereby stimulating the economy.
@BarackObama POLICE REFORM! More Americans are killed by police then terroists! PLEASE HELP US!
@BarackObama @oldtimer1968 it's pretty pathetic that he has to speak like he's talking to a two year old, and they still don't get it SMH
@veggie64_leslie @BarackObama Their leaders get it. Their followers conditioned to assume 'Socialism' so by default bad w/o further thought.
@oldtimer1968 @BarackObama 
He can't be any more basic than that. People are really uneducated and ignorant
@veggie64_leslie @BarackObama Not quite right: They are educated (at their mental levels) to misunderstand reality to pundit's advantage.
@oldtimer1968 
How can you ignore your own well being?
@veggie64_leslie Easy: You misunderstand what your well being requires because Dr/Politician/Preacher/. gave you deliberate false diagnoses!
@oldtimer1968 
A doctor could lose his license and be sued for that
Although thats not true of the other two
@veggie64_leslie Part of problem is 'group concept association' That's 'socialism' -> bad. 'Welfare' ->  bad. Not 'name: religion' -> bad
@BarackObama @BrianJWrites Good paying jod so I cant get Gov AssisTance

@BarackObama  Nice
@BarackObama And milk will cost $10/a gallon. Tell the truth. Or don't you understand economics or what the truth is?
@BarackObama Spend More than they have too
@BarackObama  Hello President Obama
@BarackObama president obama we need your help   syria
@BarackObama @jr_perdue if you raise the minimum wage then you will loose money for The Ebola cure
@BarackObama Let's not forget equal pay for WOMEN, many of whom are raising kids solo because their "men" (who are paid more) deserted them.
@BarackObama and your point IS?
@BarackObama @MagicMike1142  small businesses that cant afford to pay the higher amount of minimum-wage will be forced to lay people off
@BarackObama but we all will have to pay more for everything.  Middle class lowers again
@BarackObama The way for people to have money is lowering price on things$take a lot less money out of check& the cost of health care& bills
@BarackObama Mr. President by all means, wouldn't raising minimum wage just lead to higher prices overall? -Average High Schooler
@BarackObama @MhansenMark It's time to treat #basicincome as a truly viable solution to both economy, societal & infrastructural impediments
@MhansenMark @BarackObama It's truly a step in the right direction :)
@BarackObama In some ways US is a monarchy. Recently G Bush snr&jnr, Mr Clinton&Hilliary (possibly)?
@BarackObama No they won't.  They will send it back to their families in Mexico.
@BarackObama Yeah they'll spend that money on more taxes and other items and still be where they are except the government gets more taxes.
@BarackObama 130.
@BarackObama @bobbyelesky The only problem is that most of them will not have a job anymore.
@BarackObama You are right about that. But that increase has to be supported by increase in production. Otherwise there will be inflation.
@BarackObama between higher minimum wage and Healthcare and taxes how do you expect the small business to compete.
@BarackObama by strengthening the corporate businesses we make it harder for small businesses to grow and succeed in today's market
@BarackObama from corporate chains and inevitably supporting corporate growth and and higher earnings for the corporate management
@BarackObama if we raise minimum wage what will that do to your small businesses besides drive them to close then we are forced to buy
@BarackObama what happens when company's have to close because they can't afford it less jobs=more unemployment=weaker economy
@BarackObama if you raise minimum wage make sure the stores keep the prices the same as they were.
@BarackObama raising minimum wage wouldn't matter because then stores will raise their prices to compensate for the money they are losing.
@BarackObama they're spending now which is why they need more
@BarackObama #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama very true
@BarackObama up the min wage- this could define your legacy goobama!!!
@BarackObama spend it on drugs you muppet loser
@BarackObama  disagree wid this.if workers wages r incrsed they wil spnd more time in ledger instd of working.u cn provide them wid bonus..
@BarackObama True
@BarackObama  It'll just put people in a higher tax bracket so they'll end up giving most of their 'raise' to government. That's your goal.
@BarackObama I totally agree, raise the minimum wage and help economy!!!
@BarackObama why can't you leave us alone like just WHY!!!
@BarackObama and many will loser their jobs
@BarackObama - Yes they will spend it, as the cost of goods and services will rise.
“@BarackObama: "If we raise the minimum wage..." -President Obama #AmericaLeads” then I will want more money and the whole thing cancels out
@BarackObama if we raise minimum wage then prices go up for everyone else. It doesn't help, it hurts. They want more money, go to school.
@BarackObama felicitaciones por el logro laboral de la clase media!!
@BarackObama @North_Korea1234 That's not even close to the effect raising the minimum wage would actually have. You are so dumb Obama!
@BarackObama The equitable distribution of the national income.
@BarackObama The prices will be able to/have to go up as well, and businesses can't afford to pay more, so they will hire less.
@BarackObama Y'see? They just can't be trusted looking after stuff like that!
(and, sadly, #irony tag needed)
@BarackObama no shit
@BarackObama what good will that do.  Businesses will have to raise their prices for everything to make up for the pay raises.
@BarackObama that also means the cost of living will go up. No thanks
@BarackObama Mr President please respond to me it would really help a young black Democrat
@BarackObama yeah but for those of us who went to college, never got into trouble, and abide by the rules are paying the price.   :(
@BarackObama if we made the world play by our rules then we would be able to pay them 15 dollars an hour. Force regulations on the Chinese!
@BarackObama #flawedlogic
@BarackObama and everything will cost more too
@BarackObama yes, they will spend it on health care because they will no longer qualify for State Aid.
@BarackObama You think we should start paying fast food workers more than  privates in the military? Some commander-in-chief you are
@BarackObama @juliaunwin@CBI John Cridland @lcf @jrf_uk @localgovweb @MayorforLondon remember business cannot thrive without workers.
@BarackObama they will spend that money on the higher-priced items because inflation will grow and measured #wakeupmrpresident
@BarackObama if we lower tax on middle class they'd spend that money too!!!
@BarackObama @ExtinctDragonOG Hey Barry-O, how's the Ebola going mate?
@BarackObama This would help the Economy! Lets catch up to 2014 People!
@BarackObama #AmericaLeads I fully agree with that statement #CanadaFollows
@BarackObama I love you big guy but 11 consecutive texts all at once? Almost like a obsessive girlfriend. :)
@BarackObama No skills, no wage increase, they can be replaced just as easily by computers, like in supermarkets
@BarackObama: "If we raise the minimumwage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend that money." للحق،تطبيق ده من٢٠٠٨
@BarackObama may I ask where this money money is going to come from?
@BarackObama well then, no shit
@BarackObama why don't you start showing up to daily briefings. Then we'll talk. American's pay your wage.
@BarackObama yes raise the minimum wage because 9.50 a hour is not a enough to live on buy time i pay bills i hardly have money for food
@BarackObama Need My Dough:
@BarackObama a form of QE without increasing the money supply which means cost push inflation needs to happen now!
@BarackObama and the cost of everything will go up. Have you never heard of economics 101? #EpicFailure
@BarackObama they'll spend more money due to the increase on product prices.
@BarackObama just another lie he wants us to believe.
@BarackObama workers spent money, Economy will move.
@BarackObama more money equals more taxes taken off the paycheck
@barackobama u think an another way for this problem
@BarackObama They'll have to because prices for everything will rocket !
@BarackObama  Suspend all non- humanitarian flights to and from West Africa. What the hell are you thinking? Protect our nation dumbass.
the speech by @BarackObama today proves he is an economic cretin.
"If we raise the minimum wage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend that money." —President Obama #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama on the new iPhone?
@BarackObama People seem to think that everyone hoards their money rather than spend it and keep the economy going. Idiots.
Well what the hell do people do with money?  @BarackObama
"If we raise the minimum wage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend that money." —President Obama #AmericaLeads

@BarackObama wage freezes, week unions no cost of living wage for years. Yes to minimum wage raise.
@BarackObama Wise Mr. President continue to lead with wisdom and commonsense which seems not so common nowadays
@BarackObama Lovely message - similar to President Micheal Sata's campaign message
Thanks Einstein MT @BarackObama: "If we raise the minimum wage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend that money."
@BarackObama A master of economics you are not.
@BarackObama While others have look for other ways to feed their families after they are laid from you raising the wages.
“@BarackObama: "If we raise the minimum wage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend that money."”

@David_Cameron
@BarackObama they'll be able to spend money if you extend the unemployment benefits to Mr President
@BarackObama @anniepixeykeys 
Well said @Ed_Miliband @tpearce003 @nigerianwatch @mtpennycook @dami_dayo @danfrancis02
@BarackObama Its not economics, it's common sense.  If wages are higher, cost of products go up. Same problems, just more cost involved.
@BarackObama And who's pocket do you think it come from?  #BrainSurgeon
@BarackObama It's not often someone speaks out in support of trickle UP economy! Thanks.
@BarackObama if you don't like the minimum wage, don't have minimum skills #HeresYourSign 
@BarackObama if we raise the mionimum wage we will also raise prices and raise unemployment
@owenessedi @BarackObama 
The labor market is not as simple as you obviously think it is.
@BarackObama nope
@BarackObama Jokowi diminta tdk menaikan harga BBM krn KMPdi DPRRI  menolaknya krn sangat menyengsarakan rakyat
@BarackObama That will have to as all costs will go up and we are right back where we were before raising it. So nothing changes
.@BarackObama Someone really does NOT understand basic economics.
@BarackObama TRUE,TRUE, TRUE. When people have money they spend, so why not raise the mininum wage.
@BarackObama to school while working and raising 2 kids...finishing school and paying almost $160k under ch 13 still no relief in sight....
«@BarackObama "If we raise the minimum wage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ ... http://tmi.me/1eMkzB

@BarackObama Mr President we really need some help on these student loans....they r killing my family....after my wife and both went back
@BarackObama of course they will, because inflation will rise
@BarackObama 
YES. BEST WAY NOW TO, DEAL  WITH ECONOMICS ISSUES.
@BarackObama so raise minimum wage.
@BarackObama I'm not an economic expert, but if the minimum wage is raised, won't companies raise prices to compensate? #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama Inflationary which will cause rates to rise which will stop alleged gains in deficit which will stall alleged growing economy
@BarackObama exactly! Supply side econ does not work without any demand. More spendable income 2 middle/lower class= booming economy.
@BarackObama aren't you supposed to be smart?
@BarackObama An we'll be right back where we are.
@BarackObama It will also cause inflation - they may get $15 an hour, but that $15 will be worth $8. No such thing as a magic money machine.
@Bear2theRight @BarackObama In his Alice and Wonderland there is
@BarackObama 
Yeah, fuck savings!!

@BarackObama you want higher minimum wage for the new taxes.
@BarackObama Yes! Rich people don't create jobs; consumer demand creates jobs. Trickle-up economics makes more sense than trickle-down.

@BarackObama @mikesmith8026 Nothing like a clueless Lib that never ran a biz or made a payroll pushing out his wishful thinking as solution
@BarackObama  Dats a nice one
@BarackObama But won't that just raise the prices of everything to balance everything out?
@BarackObama darn right I will 
@BarackObama what impact will it have on the cost of goods & services?
@BarackObama Except prices will rise and the value of the dollar will drop
@BarackObama That's great thought but some people think for future and save the money for future please think in this prospective also.
.@BarackObama But if they didn't spend money they so would deserve to live in poverty.
@lucasisnotsure you're really going for the gold this time
@Felixixix666 
@BarackObama please raise min wage please!!!!! Im still suffering from unaffordable bills
. @BarackObama he really thinks the 'defining issue' of our time is freaking income inequality. Unbelievable.
And everything gets more expensive. Math is hard. https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/517750693147312129 … @BarackObama
"If we raise the minimum wage, we won’t just put more money in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend that money." —President Obama #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama better yet, how about we stop taking money from those that work so we can give it to those who don't & don't wan to.
@BarackObama A lot more carefully, watching labels, and buying products made in America, who's Corporations pay their fair share of taxes.
@BarackObama and when everyone raises their prices, well all have less to spend.
@BarackObama how about we just not tax the fuck out of the middle class cause that's really what fucks us. Not minimum wage.
@BarackObama more lies
@BarackObama except when employers cut those employees because they can't afford the cost of rising minimum wage... #SupportSmallBiz
@BarackObama Good idea, let's raise it to some unrealistic number like $2,000.95 per hour; then we will ALL be RICH #AmericaLeads #OFA
@skyflyer291 @BarackObama Why not lower it to $2.10 an hour since Republicans think employers need that money to build their business.
@BarackObama Meanwhile most of the south draws government assistance & workers compensation when there's absolutely nothing wrong with them!

Inflation 101 RT @BarackObama: "If we raise minimum wage, we won’t just put more $ in workers’ pockets—they’ll spend $." #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama I hope this also means raising the federal minimum wage for tipped workers as well
@BarackObama And then inflation will come in place
@BarackObama Minimum wage jobs are according to Democrats, the job for a lifetime !
@BarackObama They will have to in order to compensate for the raise in prices.
