@WhiteHouse @BarackObama lead by example have child care paid for by Executive budget for your employees. Child centers paid by TAXES-No
@WhiteHouse You can't lose w/ parents who would be more productive knowing their kids are secure & children who will get support they need
@WhiteHouse  Still waiting for you to mention #caregivers who needed to quit their jobs to take care of their parents. We need help.
@WhiteHouse @letat_lechat Indeed, this is an idea whose time has come #childcare
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama So make your economy as single income is sufficient for a family.
@WhiteHouse promote being independent people, not dependent people.
@WhiteHouse @FoxNews Why not set a printing press on Pennsylvania Ave, crank out $100.00 bills 'till freeloaders are millionaires. Idiots!
@WhiteHouse This is our household right now. Its not easy! #musthave
@WhiteHouse and single family unirt deserve just as much respect and help
@WhiteHouse we refuse to be left out single families of any blessing because we work hard in our home America to
@WhiteHouse . Not just with family with kids
@WhiteHouse America is made up of our grandfathers and grandmothers and our children and our uncles are aunts our are cousins
@WhiteHouse the elderly are afraid and scared because their benefits are being cut all that was left out
@WhiteHouse there are families that are just single and it's like he just left them all the way out

@WhiteHouse MY RESPECT TO MR. PRESIDENT...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it's just like water and electricity, a utility. Let's treat it that way!

@WhiteHouse AMEN!!
@WhiteHouse What about the children? The better solution is to provide opportunity for a parent to stay home! #childcareisnttheanswer#cuttax
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama fantastic state of union address. Honored to be an American!
@WhiteHouse childcare is a must-have and childcare workers feel the brunt of choices parents make every day
@JohnBobIV @WhiteHouse we don't believe in coitous interruptous or contraception¡
@WhiteHouse 100% agree! Child care, health care and education cost are out of control & killing middle class #SOTU
@WhiteHouse The day I'm ready to produce children, my child care plan while I'm at work = my mom. Kids are expensive & loud  #SOTU

@WhiteHouse thank you! Spent over $14,000 in 2014 in #childcare and before/after school care for 2 children
@WhiteHouse Licensed #childcare providers make so little money it's pathetic. Our major commodity, our children and we don't pay for it.
@WhiteHouse   Thank  you  President  Obama
“@WhiteHouse: "It’s not a nice-to-have it’s must-have. Time we stop treating child care as side issue" #Obama #SOTU ”
@WhiteHouse Lower taxes, cut regulations so businesses can pay more and a parent could stay home.
@WhiteHouse #SOTU this is a global issue #destroythejoint @JaneCaro
@WhiteHouse great for federal workers who already have good benefits but what about private sector? #SOTU
@WhiteHouse @WHLive
@WhiteHouse And some people have a SAHP as the only option, cutting income in half bc they can't afford day care. #thestruggleisreal #SOTU
@WhiteHouse what's wrong with stay at home moms?
@FoghornBLeghorn @WhiteHouse Nothing. It's about Freedom, right?
@WhiteHouse Amen!
@WhiteHouse Does this work the same way as my Healthcare was too?
@WhiteHouse your child is not my problem, if you cannot afford to have kids, don't
@snakeofcharm @WhiteHouse It's WE. Not me. Get it right!
@WhiteHouse Child Care is a goal standard for this country!!
@WhiteHouse So very true! Child care costs are real... #SOTU
@WhiteHouse Gov't, are you my daddy?
