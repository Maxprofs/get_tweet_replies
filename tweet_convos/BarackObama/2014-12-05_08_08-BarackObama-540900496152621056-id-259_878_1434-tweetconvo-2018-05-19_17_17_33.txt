@BarackObama @DopeySpaff And we also reached $18 trillion in debt recently
@DopeySpaff We can run for the time being. Soon, thanks to Keynesian economics, we're gonna have a crash worse than the Great Depression
@DopeySpaff Keynesianism fuels insane economic success. For a while. Then it crashes horribly
@DopeySpaff I'd be happy if the government kept out. The Federal Reserve alone will cause the nation's downfall if left unchecked.
@DopeySpaff If the government had kept out in the first place, there would be no Recession for us to recover from
@BarackObama....Thank for that Sir...The Lord is your strength

@liberalgirl4 @HHooversGhost @BarackObama I do. Bet you could ask any regular Fox viewer and they'd swear it was during Obamas 1st term
@liberalgirl4 @HHooversGhost @BarackObama I probably should've said they'd swear on a stack of unread bibles that it's Obamas fault.
@BarackObama hi

@BarackObama Thank you Jesus,GOD IS GOOD.GOD BLESS.
@BarackObama It's about time!
FACT:
The WORST month of http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000 … under G.W.Bush
was better than the BEST month under @BarackObama!
When @SenateDems (including @BarackObama) took Majority on 1/3/2007,
http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000 … was 63.4%
Now 59.2%
If we had 63.4% employment now,
11 MILLION more people would be employed!
