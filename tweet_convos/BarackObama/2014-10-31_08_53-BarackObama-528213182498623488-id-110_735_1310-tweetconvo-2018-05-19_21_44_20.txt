@BarackObama SO DO IT ALREADY!
@mirabarhillel @BarackObama Yeah because it's so easy for a president to have congress and the house accept any kind of policy right?
@LBL_ @BarackObama You can start by proposing it?
@mirabarhillel @BarackObama http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_Wage_Fairness_Act_(S._1737;_113th_Congress) … took me 3 mins to find that it was proposed a year ago
@LBL_ @BarackObama So why is he tweeting it now?
@mirabarhillel Because it's in the party agenda and letting voters know this is important for them would maybe change the deadlock in house?
@mirabarhillel You know, with the elections next week?
@BarackObama  yes indeed.
@BarackObama increase inflation. that's a WONDERFUL idea.

@BarackObama with a majority congress and senate you know that will never happen. Now let's talk about vaginas
@BarackObama good
@BarackObama You didn't care about the LGBT community and I am sure only an election makes you all care about women. Sad.
@BarackObama #WomenSucceed
@BarackObama yes everyone deserves a fair pay bracket no matter from what gender you came from. :-)
@BarackObama We must get paid fair before we can test the system that we are wanting to change. >S< OFA

@BarackObama our prime Minister should follow Obama and have such law in India to benefit all women in India irrespective of religion

@BarackObama as the saying goes "behind every successful man there's a women". So they need to be paid equally.

@BarackObama Fair is a child's notion, grow up and leave us alone. We don't want you deciding what is "fair"
@BarackObama We had to Improve Infrastructure for 21st Century but you and Larry Summers Fucked that up but good POTUS, w/Tax Cuts, not Jobs
@BarackObama We already have it. You should have studied more.
@BarackObama why didn't you just do an executive order? I feel women have a right to fair pay. Sadly your pushing it before the election.
@BarackObama We already have laws that say that! Passing more laws won't increase the enforcement of current law. Why not you enforce.

@BarackObama To see what a lie this is, take 2 minutes and read this:
@BarackObama How about catching up to the amount of #debt we owe.  Start with paying off the #NationalDebt before we start adding to it.
