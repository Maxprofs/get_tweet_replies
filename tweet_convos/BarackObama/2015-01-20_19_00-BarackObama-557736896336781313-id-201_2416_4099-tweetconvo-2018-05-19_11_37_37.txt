@NewMexicoRoni @WhiteHouse if you don't like Obama then don't comment, just unfollow and close your mouth. You're being extremely rude.
@pygmycorn @WhiteHouse I work for a living, pay high taxes, paid my way thru college. What do you do you troll
@NewMexicoRoni @WhiteHouse also the fact that you need to personally insult me for a personal victory is pretty low too

@NewMexicoRoni @WhiteHouse then don't personally insult me that's really petty clap clap you clearly won that aye
