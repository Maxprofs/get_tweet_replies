i hate that ppl make it seem any president has made a change in urban areas.not one has so dont put all blame on him
so was Obama supposed to call martial law in his state. What happened to the senators and governor?
what state? DC isnt a state
Illinois....u knw the whwre Chicago is located
trying to throw shade, really. I guess u are the only one that didn't understand
not u nasreen.... i was saying that to the person who mentioned dc

Unemployment went 'down', because big business only hired PART TIME once you forced them to give Obamacare to full time workers! Don't brag about this being good! All an evil illusion. No one can survive on under 25 hours a week!
Add the ones out of the job hunt? You have more people out of work than you took over tell the truth https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000 …
No thanks to obama!
Yes,thanks to Donald Trump!

Then how did millions of jobs get created and unemployment is done below 5%?
95 million jobless is not 5%
That leaves 15 million. 
Seven million are stay at home parents - a CHOICE
There are 8 million unemployed
its ok though. your 8 million stat ignores all the other relevant stats assuming they are correct from politifact. showin bias
Bush (who I voted for) used the same statistical formula for employment, so did Bush Sr & Reagan!
Fact: Economy was strong
.@BarackObama @MinnieBellW @NancyPelosi @SenatorReid @bannerite It is said that the FBI & WilkiLeaks made sure that @HillaryClinton lost.

Great tweet, read it while watching 4 homeless guys fist fight over a can of cat food outside my office.
maybe you should help and stop complaining

labor participation rate?
That's a BS number. You should know better than to harp on that same inaccurate garbage. How about the U-6? Go #trump!
bad loser..that's all foks......
I really wish you could stay, but I wanna thank you for all you've done for this country. Love you!!! ~Kia~
You're the best!
that is a padded # not everyone buys this lie.
Give us the real figure.  We're wise to your math.
Umm. 7,000 more people signed up for unemployment just last week.
There are TONS of jobs out there. Most of those 7K may have worked just enough to get credits for unemployment.
And? I don't care about irrelevant hypothetical excuses. @BarackObama
yep everyone fell off the unemployment payroll, that's how you think you done a good job your the WORST PRESIDENT EVER!!

inner circle
Liar, the economy sucks
The workforce participation rate rate is down more, making the unemployment rate you're advertising completely misleading. @BarackObama

i work HR in Cali 9 out of 10 new employees is from somewhere else. Visas + Hispanics been getting all those good state jobs!
Phony 
-Thank you for your service, leadership, and presidential example, Mr. POTUS.
Around Chrsitmas season, unemployment has always been lower.Another  example of Obama manipulating the figures. Good bye!
did you count that based off how many black people were shoot by police?
that's because they stopped looking for Jobs..there are none thanks to you. Thank God Trump.won
Bush era did send us into the hell of greed! A fine example of unregulated corporate greed. Obama saved us.
Tu veux un bucket ?
Labor participation rate is
The lowest in 80 Years.
Could you please stay four more years?

NOT! They are the worst people to live in the White House. He did nothing but destroy the U.S. Both suck!
We love you, Sir!! Please keep fighting for us!!
Bogus.  The unemployed is much higher

#slavedescendants
Thanks to Trump! #obamaworstpresident
After deporting nearly two thousand Columbians and the rest, after the threats, went home on their own with a variety of nationalities, of course, the statistics reflect less because the people are relocated.Workers between the ages of 18 and 65 are told to apply but prepare die
Thanks to Trump
According to whose honest records disclose unemployment information from entire USA /America?
Even better since your out of office.  Trump was correct when he said you will go down as the worst president in history.  He won by the way!
Was going up in wages. Not now.
Little reminder @realDonaldTrump


Everytime I cross over into the US, I see help wanted signs posted on businesses.

You made a lot of promises you didn't keep.
Its down to 4.9% yet we have the largest ever of people not in the work for than ever before????  How's that work
It’s now 4.0% under trump
It's not a math problem it's a truth problem.Same problem the Obama administration has had since 08

@alliejane If the unemployment rate is down,does that mean all the "new workers" get so little they're all on Foodstamps??
No. I believe many like me try to make it with 2 low pay jobs., no benefits.
on Twitter
We are.  We elected@realDonaldTrump thanks!  PS - That number is so phony (lots out of work force, not counted as unemployed).
Work for work sake and service to self and humanity at large and not merely earn and spend money and enjoy.
AMEN
uh-huh
The economy has been horrible for Americans except for the White House! Billions, Trillions wasted & taken from America Stopped

many sad you're leaving I remind all how young you are and we can count on many more great things, that you won't leave us.TY
question...unemployment is at 4.9% but the EMPLOYMENT rate is around 59%. Why is the unemployment rate more impressive?
More LIES!
let's keep working? Over half the country isn't working that's the problem Trump will fix this. stay in Hawaii. U were schooled
When @BarackObama has more followers than @POTUS

Killer! 
Barack @BarackObama
you need to stop your racial divide that you keep spilling out of your mouth on a daily basis, it is shameful !!
noted by the same polls that said Hillary would B our next president.
Becuz nobody can find FULL TIME Working 2 part time jobs to support family. Health ins skyrocket; lost job when co left US
WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID (NSA)
Your economy sucks
raise the minimum wage to $10an hour, people will keep their jobs have a little more money and will be on the road to 15 bucks
ya because you put them all on welfare lol most deceptive stat of all time

jobs like, janitors?  Mall security guards?  Fast food workers at minimum wage?  These aren't full time careers!
Zechariah 12:3
 All the nations will gather against Israel to try to move her, but they will only hurt themselves.
not counting the millions that have given up and stopped trying to find work. Useless garbage statistics.
thats great..
Try the real number of 30%
so happy you only have 12 days left the you were a very useless person on earth
Numbers due to the sack of wet potatoes we have sitting in the highest office..Nothing to do with the 8 yrs of hard work Mr.Obama put in...
Let's hope we can recover from what you have done to our company.
we can't tell like you and your Administration are cooking the books thank God you're almost out
If you don't count long-term unemployed, who really do need jobs.
Like the other 95 million Americans, I have quit looking for work and no longer have any unemployment available.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Obama Build your  Library & stop further screwing up the US and Intl. Policy. U R BEING VINDICTIVE##

That is a non partisan government oversight agaency.
where are you looking ? Not in rural middle class America
https://www.gofundme.com/open-a-community-24-hr-daycare … offering up to 15 jobs as soon as I open.
and everyone else is just given up. That's why your numbers are so damn low. You're a failure.
First act of office "Lower Missile Defense Funding" so who's Missile Offensive did you fund? (not us, gave land to Russia.)
Because so many people just gave up looking for a job.Barry you have nothing to brag about but how poorly you did your job.

hola señor me han faltado él respeto,kieren ensuciar mi record,perdón,
@POTUS  In November 2016, the U.S. underemployment rate was at 13.2 percent. Better, but still horrible!
/  GOOD MORNING / NIGHT  SIR. GOD BLESS U ALL SIR.
you're sure your guys have combed through the constitution and not found any loopholes for a 3rd term?
love January 20th
hello president Obama and family we miss you and will support whatever you do 
There's a few more days left before your presidency ends. For 8 yrs. that you're the President, I failed to experience the prom
I call bullshit, more polling errors. Our country is not in a good fiscal way, esp for the common man. So what is unemployment
The ten's of millions of UNEMPLOYED Americans who fell OFF your stats know the REAL story.Unemployment in USA is at least 9%.
We need you to stand up to Putin and Trump, please!! Ask our electors to vote Clinton!
fake numbers and you know it
Copy cat. Tweets are not created equal. While Trump's tweets are manly demanding, Obama's tweets seem desperately amateur. Weak
Before you leave office, double digit the minimum wage by using an Executive Order. Legalizing MJ is not an bad idea as well.
