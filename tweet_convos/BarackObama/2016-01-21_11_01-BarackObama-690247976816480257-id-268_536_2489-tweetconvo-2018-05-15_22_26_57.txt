@BarackObama my coverage went from $350 to over $450 this year for worse coverage. Ugh. Last company went under.  Had to switch.
@TotesMcGotes and mine went down for better coverage but then, we did our research before choosing @BarackObama
@DesertSmokeBBQ @BarackObama I got screwed. Nevada Health Co-Op went under and would cover my prescriptions near end of year. Bad deal.

@BarackObama sorry, still much too expensive for people who have no health problems whatsoever. Who has an extra $360 a month? Not me.
@BarackObama the insurance prices for coverage are outrageous as well as the deductibles, so what's affordable about it?

@BarackObama , working in healthcare , the plans in California hare high deductible with high premium payments. They suck!

@BarackObama
@BarackObama SURE!!
@BarackObama they'll be serenity when you leave office
@BarackObama follow me
@BarackObama Even if just to say no. Will people begging for help ever get it? Or will they just give up trying to reach you for help
@BarackObama my daughter and her husband's premium doubled #Obamacare reeks
@BarackObama Love to.Can't afford it + Kansas threw me off Medicaid because of the HCA (term."Obamacare" is disrespectful & annoys me) Help?
@BarackObama Why did I lose my tax credit? I work three jobs to support myself and this is ridiculous. Gulf Shores, Al. 
@BarackObama Thank you so much 
Mr President Barack Obama
@BarackObama ...or even better...become a politician and get it for free for life !!
@BarackObama, It's a TaxScamBuisness NOT a HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY! Also UNAFFORDABLE.
@BarackObama Mr. President I wanted to say, although I didnt agree with you on some things. I highly respect you!
@BarackObama  hi
@BarackObama Hope I helped, @katyperry wants me i'm sure she'll get me covered, if not my time is short without her anyway. be well Barack.
@BarackObama my insurance premiums and deductibles have increased 30% since the Affordable Care Act. Boooooo
@BarackObama Peace of mind will happen when you are no longer president.
@BarackObama Keep defending it, instead of working with congress to make it better. Has Pelosi read it yet now that it passed?
@BarackObama GET THE PEACE OF MIND THAT COMES FROM HAVING GOD!
@BarackObama your health care is a scam. Good thing I have a good job.
@BarackObama your entire presidency is a farce, just like Obamacare
@BarackObama Hello  mr President  i hope u know  someone was piping at ur window
@BarackObama @Ps139Donna . Absolutely Mr. President, I am grateful to have private insurance  from my employer.
@BarackObama 40% premium increase, sky rocking co-pays? That kind of serenity ?
@BarackObama How can BO be proud of Expensive Health care act (ACA)? Because he is a friction Socialist LIBERAL!  My PREMIUMS just went UP!!
@BarackObama blah blah blah
@BarackObama I seen on news we may lose the insurance I hope not I worked since 15 yes old without it I'm glad we have Obama care
@BarackObama Thank You Mr. President for your response
@BarackObama just because you have insurance doesn't make it quality insurance. My premium increased while my coverage decreased!
@BarackObama I envy you because you rule the world
@BarackObama why penalize people who don't get insurance before the cutoff date?
@BarackObama Just think you can get insured for around $20,000 a year with premium and deductible then you get to use it, sound good?
@BarackObama peace of mind? I applied Dec 7th still haven't gotten approved for insurance for med or my children yet. No peace of mind here.
@BarackObama sweet
@BarackObama 
 I got screwed. Nevada Health Co-Op went under and would cover my prescriptions near end of year. Bad deal.
@BarackObama lose your mind knowing you could have bought a vacation home for the cost of the premium. Not to mention $5000 deductible.
@BarackObama There is no piece of mind with Obamacare - not with a $7000 deductible!  Who can afford that?  That is not insurance!
@BarackObama retiring President, new Metlife agent.
@BarackObama helo
@BarackObama We will have peace when you buy your own and retire to make Africa great. They need lots of help.

@BarackObama Get health Insurance so Pharma corporations can keep their profits rising, and keep politici on their payrole.
@BarackObama My premium went up $138. Why? Because of where I live. I work three jobs, thank you for making it harder to pay my Health Ins.
