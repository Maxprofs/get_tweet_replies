If you look at the map correctly those are the states that are living the most off of other people's money it's called welfare thank goodness for the government to take care of those who don't want to take care of themselves

Is that why our premiums have doubled and next year Alabama will not have any companies to pick from! Your a Liar!
The Affordable Health Care Act is unaffordable! The premiums & high deductibles should be regulated!
Took poor peoples tax money they pay bills with due to lost of jobs.  Many I know was hurt because they didn't know it would happen to them.  #AfricanAmerican #SlaveDescendants #NotImmigrants #ForcedToComeHere
Deductible 2500 mnthly pymnt of 250 I am on SSI &cant affrd it What a joke. But if i wrked it would b cheaper plus only 1 cmpany to pick frm
But don't forget you can keep your health care and you can keep your plan and you can keep your doctor haha
Positive impact for who?
What holds states back is that it sucks!
Oh yes King Obama! Look at all that red ink in our bank accounts!
Amen
Good
People wake up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he destroyed health care in the whole country  He didn't mean any good he new what he was doing ! Why is it you all have your head under a rock wake up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FAKE MAPS ! All you did was kill me with raising my health insurance ten times what i was paying ? So soon i will have to sell my house just to pay my insurance ! How long will that last before i end up in the streets and freeze to death ? Good move on destroying Health care !
Obamacare is a disaster
How does it feel to be - most likely - indicted in @HillaryClinton's email scandal via your @gmail pseudonym? #ouch #USElection

High co$t of 'private Insurance'...propose plan to regulate NOW! Introduce an alternative plan, STOP GOP's wrath of anguish and death to US
The reason uninsured rates went down is because you are penalizing people for not having health insurance!
it caused my premiums to double you fool.
Hi mr Barack Obama how is the  wife  and young the children  i love y'all 
All lies!! 5-18-17. Thanks liar
Hello Mr
Doesn't look like too many people agree with you on this
So you like the new plan from the clown that's so bad the republicans who voted it in exempted themselves from it?
Are you on drugs???

Can't afford the "Affordable" Care Act, can't afford employer offered insurance, am uninsured and have to pay a fine... make sense???
Trump, the Repubs keep "trying" to push through a "healthcare" bill; we need to keep your bill, even if R's need to tweak it.
Is that why obamacare is not affordable for so many people and premium doubled in 2017?
Slt
The only ppl who want to repeal the ACA are ppl who already HAVE insurance. THEY shouldn't have a voice in the matter.
Hello, my name is Timur. I am writing to you from Uzbekistan. Can I ask a question if you do not mind?
i believe microsoft was the main cause of OBC problems, not the hc plan!!
You are delusional about this act. Bankrupting the USA and falling apart. More people can't afford copays...some positives!
. Says the guy which does not understand economics.
. go on god bless you
How are you doing my name shy
It has utterly sucked for me. W/deductibles so high, it hasn't paid a dime in three years. Plus, I had to find a new doctor!!
You it's going to come out that you were aware of the Trump wire tap.
What is the one big factor holding the states back?
KEEP YOUR PLAN ! KEEP YOUR DOCTOR!  ALL LIES!!!
obamacare cost me an extra $ 145 a month  please stop saying i good was obamacare  you took food from my kids I'm paying over $1500
You and your people are truly delusional! You actually think it was a great plan.  Ha ha. You are a legend in your own mind!
That's why United Healthcare is joining almost every other major Health insurance co. in no longer offering obamacare policies?

covered.  Don't tell my family how good the ACA is.  Please
and the cheapest ACA coverage was multiple times more expensive than his previous coverage, with fewer procedures...
in my family.  ACA is a train wreck.  One physician relative had to turn to alternative coverage when he lost his partner...
more people covered, but less coverage.  Focusing more on the money than the patient.  I know this, I have several physicians
issues instead of spending time with patients.  Definitely higher costs, higher out of pocket for patients.  Oh, yes, and ...
What!? Conveniently ignoring facts. It's killing the healthcare industry.  Dr's having to focus more on administrative ...
it's gone now
Obamacare... talk about cult of personality!
FLORIDA with all its retirees and money pouring in...I can get no help and I am terrified
right like unaffordable premiums for my husband
are you still smoking something Obamacare sucks check with the patients, doctors and surgeons
Obama Care was a big failure.  Hard working Americans paid for the poor while they couldn't afford it. The Un-affordable ins.
#obamacare
Segue ele @JhenyDasGalaxia
caraca sua down
KKKKKKKKKKKK
medo de você

Yes, IT DOESN'T WORK.
.obamacare is self destructing it is really obamacrap
you are my president idc if the Orange skin racist reality star is the president you are the best president out there always 
But that ain't all every race, religion, ethnicity, sex, height and girth 2. Alright  love all yall.
I should cry or laugh?  Your comments are pitiful. No wonder Dems lost seats and continue to do so
why does @realDonaldTrump think otherwise Mr Obama, he called #Obamacarw a disaster and I wanted to cry, he said scrap it!
#Wrong companies are richer but ppl can't afford their deductibles. Deal w it everyday #FalseInfo
Thank you for your integrity and hard work. I can't imagine how hard it must have been working with children for 8 years.
ACA was a disaster too many mandates. Hurt more people then it did any good!
yes like premiums doubling and tripling.
wow! truth finally. Impact=I'm broke from 1100.00 per month bill
sorry u still in LaLa Land Obamacare is going and i thank Trump for that redo your Legacy
thank you for being the most gracious representative of this country,  and the implementation of the health are act.  Saved me
wisconsin's " badgercare" is ok but income limits extreme. also, why can't we have eye, ear and dental coverage?
DELUSIONAL
how many americans will die
Miss You and Your Wife May God Bless and keep you Both
called good sense that's what's holding them back
you're right, the impact is undeniable... the positive part is what's up for debate.
how could they just get rid of it...I can't stop crying!
I call bullshit on that
I know working families that are paying $700 per month more than they were before Obamacare.   You fucked over working America!
so what plan do u have on Obama care?
No, there isn't. Stop lying. All you do is lie. I guess thats why your followers are mostly idiots and derelicts.
I can certainly deny it.  I can't believe how blind you still are after all this time.

yea.  Money. No one can afford it
Let me explain. In California we have mandatory auto liability ins. and that is so the insurance companies have more payees.
https://www.facebook.com/Save-ACA-202801086854844/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel … Please Save The ACA and May God Bless my Beloved Obama Family and all they Care for
your respectful regard for the law, your understanding of the Constitution, your inclusion of all...
yes everyone got some welfare insurance w/same care they get at VA centers! U have to cut the population somehow right?
positive my ass! Are you going to pay my premiums? Who's going to do my surgery now ? Some shit doctor?
$600 per month 6k deduct equals 0$insurance except catastrophic. Pathetic
Would that be its negative impact?
My friends are BROKE because of the ACA.
All major Health Insurer's bailing out. Deductions at such high level insurance can't be used.
Cost cost cost
No positive side to it. A govt controlling money maker.
Yeah,big factor is that it destroyed middle class businesses and was FORCED on ppl.
I see no positive impact in AZ I lost all my doctors and need to find new ones my surgery got canceled! Have to start over!
Aren't the rate of insured and their affordability and satisfaction two completely different things?
.
Obamacare is a major fail. If you cared about the people and this country you would admit it. But you care more about your ego
This is my daughter. She has cancer-10 yrs fighting! ACA helped save her life! Thank you! Now what for her?
one person's gain is a million people's loss...The healthcare system aims at the most benefit for most people
your Healthcare backfired taxation without representation!
Sure is!  No insurance companies!
false to rip ppl off u hate America pay back all the money you stole from us
The Presdent tells us how great he is, even gave himself a medal.  He is wrong as usual.
