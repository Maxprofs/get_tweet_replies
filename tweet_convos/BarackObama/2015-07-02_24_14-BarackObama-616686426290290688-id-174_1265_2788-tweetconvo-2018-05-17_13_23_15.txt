@BarackObama No Middle-Class family should be TAXED out of the education that they need. -- Hard working Taxpayer.
@BarackObama also education is a privilege NOT a right. Different social class should receive different Gov.  supports pending to incomes.
@BarackObama education must be free for all. My education in India was free and that is why i am what I am in America .
@BarackObama pay my tuition mr president? Please? I'm an Eagle Scout if that helps 
@BarackObama Absolutely! Education is critical for all of us.

“@BarackObama: "No middle-class family should be priced out of the education that they need." —President Obama”
@BarackObama true, this is wonderful!!
@BarackObama No family, regardless of income, should have to struggle for education.
@BarackObama What does that mean? Are they priced out, or made different choices? YK
@BarackObama..If you really mean this comment,then why are you supporting Britain/Nigeria in its evil aim of en slaving #BIAFRANS?
@BarackObama Not just middle class, lower class too!
@BarackObama correction: no family*
@BarackObama a nice sentiment although wouldn't it be nice if the lower class families could also raise themselves up through education?
@barackobama so long as you don to go making it a legislated right and instead look into the explosive price growth way beyond inflation.
@BarackObama Yes! Everything to everybody, for FREEEEEEEE!!!

@BarackObama @The_Dream99 uggggh. Maybe he shouldn't be hamstringing tge economy then #PoliticiansAreScumbags
@BarackObama ...not only the middle class but all Americans who are ready for education
@BarackObama I hope this is the beginning of the end to the 'rip-off' culture of American corps.
@BarackObama  so it's ok for children of other classes to be priced out of an education?
@BarackObama Education is not used for the valuation level of the family - family is the school of life
@BarackObama except for when they are anyway because of the way financial aid brackets work and are evaluated
@BarackObama this explains why I can't even afford to go to college. LOL

@BarackObama Then why in almost two terms has nothing changed? Why should both me and my children be in debt forever to get educated?
@BarackObama Most degrees are junk! When are you going to put a dent in the national debt? #Truth
@BarackObama And what about people not in the middle class?  People who look like you mostly?  Education is their way out of poverty.
@BarackObama Nobody should be priced out of education that they need... Education is priceless or should be...
