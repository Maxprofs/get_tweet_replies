@BarackObama 8 yrs to fix George w. mess and you sold out. so sad
@BarackObama ben yanındayım sen camdan bakarken NO TİME.
@BarackObama prosecutors and cops need to be held accountable if they hold back evidence/discovery like you see in so many cases . SCJ!
@BarackObama Legalized Marijuana. its no worse than beer. Then execute all those murderers on death row. Problem solved.

@BarackObama MR.PRESIDENT YOU ARE SO RIGHT! BLESS YOU!
@BarackObama I vote change the messages the media and the film industry promote, as this is where the majority adopts their morality.
@BarackObama Yes, it's called "teach character to children in our schools" #pscep
@BarackObama Australian in China.I agree with you on medicare,no guns and an equal go.It seems US system is deeply unfair or lacks humanity.
@BarackObama do something
@BarackObama
@BarackObama we will fix the system once we get rid of you!
@BarackObama okay then let's get everyone out of jail.  problem solved
@BarackObama Reserve jail space for those heartless repeat offenders.
@BarackObama Strict laws and extreme prison time for dangerous and repeat offenders could deter many crimes.
@BarackObama My major concerns are dangerous repetitive criminals that have no regards for life, the murderers, home invaders and robbers.
@BarackObama holle
@BarackObama :) :) :)
@BarackObama And about 10%, maybe more, are innocent! #FixTheSystem
@BarackObama you are sooooo right. I wish you could lead us for another term sir
@BarackObama Fixing the system will require a constitutional amendment that disallows corrupt people from being In Law Enforcement.
@BarackObama ..... And the next guy will put them back in!
@BarackObama This is not a new concept..BUT fixing it is a long term commitment to  the realization of what the problems are and changing.

@BarackObama #endsolitary
@BarackObama you made it worse , no doubt
@BarackObama I think you've done an amazing job over there!! Move to New Zealand we need someone like you!!!! XXX
@BarackObama Poor folks don't have a chance. Legal is too expensive. Stop keeping drug users in jail 5-30 yrs expensive and unnecessary.
@BarackObama You keep letting in drug dealers/criminals with your open borders/stand down Border Patrol.
@BarackObama Need 3X and death penalty for drug dealers. No repeat offenders after the third time and end to overcrowded prisons.
@BarackObama why does @onetoughnerd  still have a job? U do kno he poisoned a City right
@BarackObama because the strets of Chicago would be safer
@BarackObama Well Mr. President you have your chance.
@BarackObama No, We're better off with a president that actually respects our heritage, unlike you.
@BarackObama # OromoProtest How about Ethiopian Tigre gangs mass killings, mass detention of Oromo people and others in Ethiopia right now?

@BarackObama veni chapame negrito lindo. Ahr
@BarackObama Lovely rhetoric, now stop persecuting @JulianAssange_ you bully.
.@BarackObama the 1st thing u can do is stop putting your thumb on the scale for a candidate who has made MILLIONS off of for profit prisons
@BarackObama The ship over lake Merritt to my knowledge, fit with a Kim Jon Young attack on our shores, my kobudo defense was at Japan level
@BarackObama It may have even been in Oakland that Day to attack our president in S.F. couldn't do it, swung back around and nailed me. 
@BarackObama the reason I used that Imoge was because it felt like that inside the way the images depict.
@BarackObama the force needed and the consequent "rottweiler effect" that day was for the defense of this ship, approach. Me in place;Sensei
@BarackObama the "rottweiler effect" This really big dog once charged at me, in a dead heat rampaging and all at once, a side ways stumble.
@BarackObama so after 7 years all you have come up with is "we need to do something"?
Barack Obamaさん

@BarackObama hello
@BarackObama Mr. President, please forgive me, Barbara Boxer may know I fight Death Penalties. Standing firmly against it, a skull's enough
@BarackObama Get rid of the private for-profit prison system. Is it constitutional to incarcerate publicly-convicted people privately?
@WayneASchneider @BarackObama True!!!
@BarackObama You have so many priorities that are nearly as mundane as your time wasted in the White House.
@BarackObama Turn them all loose so they can do it all over again and we can keep lawyers busy or start executing them.
@BarackObama excelent Mr. President.
@BarackObama agree Mr. President!
@BarackObama Decriminalize marijuana, the perfect executive order. What are you waiting for?
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama what?  Grow up!  We need MORE prison space, not less!
@BarackObama quit replacing the role of fathers with welfare state. Boys raised by single mothers 70% more likely to be in prison.
@BarackObama sir pls tel Buhari to release the leader of IPOB,because the court has oderd for his release...but buhari said No to that...
