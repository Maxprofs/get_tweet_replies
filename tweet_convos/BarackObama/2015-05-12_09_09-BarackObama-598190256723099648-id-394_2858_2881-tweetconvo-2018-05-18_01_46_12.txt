@WhiteHouse @BarackObama2Day nice OBAMA,
@WhiteHouse will get positive results if you allow freedom of choice for parents. Why do u refuse a parents choice?
@dianekyle @WhiteHouse What do you mean by CHOICE? Think of all that entails & costs if I CHOOSE to send my kids to schools 2-3 towns over.
@patsyhaggerty @WhiteHouse every parent should have freedom of choosing where they send their kids. I car pooled with other parents.
@patsyhaggerty @WhiteHouse car pool no additional cost. As they say if there is a will there is a way. Up to parents to make happen.
@dianekyle @WhiteHouse  4 kids in 4 different schools miles away from home depending on Car Pools (w/o school bus)  What could go wrong????
@patsyhaggerty @WhiteHouse car pools have historically worked. I networked with other moms. we all had same goal to help our kids
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Agreed
@WhiteHouse Edu is one of many reasons we are taxed to death. Find another source if investment.
@butchg12 Without education and taxes there would be more people like you in the world.
@nakad_buck that is about what I would expect out of a democrat. You and Barack make a fine team.
@butchg12 I really admire Barack. I wish he could be elected for another 4 years.
@nakad_buck   Dear Buck, You have just proven that a fence post has more intelligence.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama child needs help
@whitehouse  we will always appreciate the effort that u are applying in restoring peace across the globe.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Education is so important for our current and future.  Time to invest in our youth.  K to 12 need help!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama My son has been bullied m-f from students and teachers.  Nochildleftbehind & 2 pass him.  Pls HELP!!!
@WhiteHouse it's time you stop expanding govt and giving illegals more benefits
@thedataleech @WhiteHouse A lot of those "illegals" contribute more to American society than many  natural born Americans themselves.
@RoweRohan @thedataleech @WhiteHouse they pay sales taxes like all us, too.
@IgnatzMuskrat3k @thedataleech @WhiteHouse Many file taxes 4/15 voluntarily. 100% of the 1% elite only file what and when they're forced to.

@WhiteHouse @yodaquoter How about police reform? Let's 'invest' in civil rights..end militarized police departments, save kids @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @kathleenelias0

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama Gave Amnesty to Child Molester “Papa Bear”
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse support education  for kids but remember the greatest result for good education is a parents freedom of choice.
@WhiteHouse What these kids need is a 2-parent home. That's where childhood education begins-NOT more gov "investment."
@DebsFriends @WhiteHouse oh, you figured that out. You must be a Democrat.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama A NEW KIND OF EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE FORMED FOR THE FUTURE. ONE THAT UNITES ALL PEOPLE.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama you sure have niggers up the place, and oddly everyone of those agencies are in deep shit. Dig them out.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  nice
@WhiteHouse ABSOLUTELY! But Early Childhood Care is also essential for children #NotJustSchoolReadiness @heckmanequation
@WhiteHouse @PreschoolToday We do!
@WhiteHouse @rivernewstc No govt studies show any gains in early childhood schools are gone by Jr. High.
@WhiteHouse @Pyotr__Stolypin not a institutional environment
@WhiteHouse @Pyotr__Stolypin they need time before school be with a individual who cares about them
