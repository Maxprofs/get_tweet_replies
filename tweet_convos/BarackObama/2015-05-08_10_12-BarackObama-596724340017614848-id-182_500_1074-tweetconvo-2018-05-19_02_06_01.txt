@BarackObama Socialism never worked & you and your comrades keep pushing it
@plkarter @BarackObama works pretty well in Canada
@NathanMcFadden7 @BarackObama Does it? Or the gullibility level is so high that compliancy is orgasmic? I just prefer Individuality & choice
@plkarter @BarackObama k
@BarackObama I expect more from you than zero-sum + spurious logic. By opposing this change, we don't therefore support what exists.
@perredicarlo @barackobama
@BarackObama. COMO SE SIENTE SER PRESIDENTE DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS DE NORTE AMÉRICA
@BarackObama everyone is but communist?
@BarackObama concordo com o sr.agree
@BarackObama i am opposed to trade deals, period. we don't need a trade deal, we need a trade policy that brings back jobs
@BarackObama we wouldn't be opposed if legislators could debate and amend trade deals. That's what we elected them to do!#NoFastTrack
@BarackObama selling America
@BarackObama Le regole economiche esistenti sono abusi sugli aumento dei prezzi fermando la vendita e la produzione farzata è inutile
@BarackObama the quo has long since lost it's status with me
and U2
IC.
The status quo is America rocks.  You fundamentally disagree. @BarackObama
@BarackObama No, it means I want a deal which isn't unfair.
@BarackObama. Well you traded the illegals for our jobs is that what you mean
@BarackObama Aferin
@BarackObama I'm not satisfied with the status quo that's why I helped put you in office! However I want transparency in all proposed bills!
.@BarackObama So, are you gonna have an on-the-record sit-down with @SenWarren?  How 'bout @SenSanders?  You've got some questions to answer
@BarackObama  you want a trade deal at the expense of the AMERICAN WORKERS NO DEAL you are a job killer the American citizens are not stupid
@BarackObama Really?
@BarackObama show the public what it is then. And we might not b so opposed. We have the right to know.
@BarackObama CON GRAN RESPETO ME DIRIJO A USTED. ...NECESITO COMUNICARLE  UNA SITUACIÓN FAMILIAR COMO PUEDO ENVIAR CORRESPONDENCIA. .A USTED
@BarackObama good
@BarackObama The only things preventing trade now are protective worker/environmental/union laws & companies can’t sue gov’ts 4 free money!
@BarackObama Seriously? How much longer till you are the lame duck POTUS?
@BarackObama 根据你之前的推文，你的意思是中国不思进取，为什么你会认为自己的制度无懈可击，仅仅是因为盲目的自信?
@BarackObama Smart as in they will send more  American industrial jobs overseas to lower wage workers?
@BarackObama every move you've made for this country has been very wrong. I mean very wrong. You should've been impeached a long time ago.
@BarackObama You're losing it man. That argument is weak. #FAIL

@BarackObama If you are opposed to these trade deals, then you must be Barack Obama. #NAFTA http://citizen.typepad.com/eyesontrade/2015/01/obama-vs-obama-the-state-of-the-unions-self-defeating-trade-pitch.html …
@BarackObama No. If you are opposed to these trade deals, you might be opposed to more of the same. #NaftaOnSteroids #StopTPP #NoFastTrack
@BarackObama A lot of people are worried about the Trans-Pacific Trade Pact. So many people are in bad financial situations already.
@BarackObama Mr: precedent see your video in facebook.you are great precedent in these words......
@BarackObama This promotion is against your nature.Why?Is it the  Bilderberg group?Trilateral commission?Be honest.I can't believe you!
@BarackObama hey do u read all these?
@BarackObama Bad logic. There are alternatives.
@BarackObama Even a good trade bill is bad if lobbyists get to tack on their bosses' wish lists #50-plus-year-copyright
@BarackObama We are opposed to *secret* trade deals written by lobbyists.If you're opposed to transparency, you must have something to hide.
@BarackObama I am very much against TTIP.  It is in the interest of companies,   not the common man nor our wonderful mother earth.
.@BarackObama Your logical fallacy is: black-or-white / false choice. https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white 
@BarackObama not satisfied w/status quo. Just these policies historically have never worked long term. You twist the facts to legitimize.
@BarackObama i am sure not satisfied with the leadership, or lack of, in Washington, SIR.
@BarackObama Or that we want an honest, transparent process that benefits everyone. #NoFastTrack

@BarackObama Nope - America still wants you gone, #Obama.
Sorry, @BarackObama. Consulting congress and the will of the American people is what Americans AREN'T opposed to #LESSthan2yearsandbacktoCHI
@BarackObama Mr. President, you're smart enough to know that's a false dichotomy.
@BarackObama Mr. President, you are Republican-lite.
@BarackObama nonsense.. That's what it's an "agreement" instead of a treaty.. Fast track nonsense. The DOW has doubled,what about the 99%?
@BarackObama Obama's been doing a lot of subtweeting lately
@BarackObama oh come on. This is the same logic as Bush's "you're with us or you're with the terrorists" comment.
@BarackObama An individual's steps should be in tune with the steps of progress of any nature.
@BarackObama No. It could mean some just disagree with you; how you see things and ways to tackle the problem. YK
@BarackObama How about, for change you are pleading for, you guys bring jobs BACK HOME?
@BarackObama You had two damn terms to get it right.
@BarackObama Dont hate Mr. Pres. We don't like your policies just like your #Solyndra #obamacare Prove it first by reducing taxes!
@BarackObama Just BullSh*t. Hey you can't win them all. Stop giving corporations unnneded handouts! Just making Rich richer helps No 1 else!
@BarackObama NO SIR MR PRESIDENT I JUST REMEMBER HOW BAD NAFTA WAS AND WHAT IT DID TO OUR ECONOMY.FACT!
@BarackObama  Stop insulting our intelligence. If it's smart and progressive then open it to public review. Let's see what's really in it.
@BarackObama aveses debemos reconocer que nos equivocamos.
@BarackObama my granddaughter Ava would like to meet you. But we live in California and I am on a fixed income..
@BarackObama the only people relatively satisfied is upper class. Lower class is still very dissatisfied that we cannot find good employment
@BarackObama just want to know what's actually on it.
@BarackObama 
I respect you.
Since you are likely better schooled in econ than I, I'm trusting you on this and will support it.
@coldwomaninmn @BarackObama   Sure worked great last time   http://www.manufacturingnews.com/news/10/0615/WTO.html …
@BarackObama No, Mr. President, we add neither satisfied with the status quo or the TPP. That is a false choice. Make the details public!
@BarackObama Please be more specific Mr. President !
@BarackObama TPP and TTIP are the status quo - corporations suing governments, an end to sovereignty, no net neutrality.
@BarackObama like it well done
@BarackObama are those our only choices, either things stay the same or we make them worse?
@BarackObama TPP moves us towards more corporate power over people. More corporate leverage over sovereign states.
@BarackObama Then make the trade agreement public.
@BarackObama or not want to pay 100% more for a product. It's immoral yes- but let's fix things on the Homefront first, yeah?
@BarackObama it could mean that you don't want something that is even worse than the status quo.
.@BarackObama Or it means you know TPP could make things worse.  I'm going with Warren, Krugman, and Reich. Go ahead, call them ignorant.
@BarackObama I am satisfied with the status quo, yes, when compared to you making it EVEN WORSE. Just counting the days til you leave.
@BarackObama post the document on Tpp  on the internet Mr President we will go ahead for our self's and decide. Please respond Thanks
@BarackObama Балаболка чёрная,марионетка.от которой ничего не зависит...!!!(((
@BarackObama 
I am sure majority of public will say big NO to status quo
@BarackObama and if does come to it, we can do better. Much better. #nodeal
@BarackObama Your naive view of China is ludicrous. They're orchestrating #WWIII and will take Asia to India when you invite them into NK.
@BarackObama quite the opposite, this will benefit corporations, not American workers. It's not "its this or nothing"
@BarackObama sir want to meet you with Mr family may i......... Kindly  respond
@BarackObama the only social force  that can  carry out  such a deal is working class  the terms of the deal are satisfying :))) G.job:))
@barackobama pak di amerika jam berapa sekarang ???
@BarackObama Not entirely Mr. President. I just can't agree with something I haven't read. Release the whole bill for public viewing Please?
.@BarackObama If we knew what the deal is we might understand what tha hell 'ure talkin' about.
@BarackObama @edshow We don't trust #Corporate Democrats especially @GOP & Lukewarm Media #TPP
@BarackObama When policy is supported by corporations & politicians its never good 4 the working ppl. Climb out of the corporate bed u r in.
@BarackObama Sir, I am very happy with you as our President.  Please don't back Hilary.
@BarackObama Your use of "progress" places it in direct opposition to "smart."
@BarackObama really sir, every person check our working and pre plan and take advice advance so also achieve the goal.
. @BarackObama sadly, propaganda worthy of the #GOP . Why are you selling out America to the corporations!????
@BarackObama fo real though, how much $$$ are you getting for #TPP
@BarackObama If it's so great how come it has to be fast-tracked? The status-quo is what it is BECAUSE OF trade deals EXACTLY like this.
@BarackObama  No, we're opposed because we can open a history text. Stop selling our workforce out; you're better than that. #NoToTPP
@BarackObama I understand your confusion, personally, I have no problem with smart or progress. My problem is with #MoreOfTheUsualIgnorance
@BarackObama you're a republican in democrats clothes.
“@BarackObama~"If you are opposed to these smart, progress trade deals,that means you must be satisfied with the status quo.—President Obama
@barackobama It's  better to be status quoist than to follow ur irrational path. Shut up Yankees!
@BarackObama

@BarackObama that's a false dichotomy bruh

progress trade deals, that means you
must be satisfied with the status

@BarackObama that's not true, this deal kills American jobs

@BarackObama The people aren't buying it. http://www.thestand.org/?p=40172 
@BarackObama @alexandretta_ That has to be a mis-quote, right?  I don't think "progress" can be used as an adjective.
@BarackObama: nobody even knows what these "smart" trade deals look like except high level CEO's. #ShowUstheDeal #NOTPP #NoFastTrack
@BarackObama https://twitter.com/GREATGAETANO/status/595865517656768512 … many people are fed up with the ways of the goverment, we need to bring you politics together !!!

@BarackObama And, what is the status quo?.
@BarackObama well its smart and progressive to you Sir. Am I stupid that I think otherwise. That wasn't a presidential statement in short.
@BarackObama ok ok
@BarackObama @littleMegna what's up
@BarackObama we would be more satisfied if the administration was forthcoming with allowing the citizens to read the document FIRST.

If u r opposed to apples, you have to eat oranges all day would be the same logic.

@BarackObama Trade with anybody is a great thing
