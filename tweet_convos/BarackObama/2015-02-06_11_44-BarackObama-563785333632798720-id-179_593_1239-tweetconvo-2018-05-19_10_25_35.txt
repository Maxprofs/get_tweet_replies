@marklangford When can I be optimistic Mark? When can I be happy again. You tell me.
.@MlicariEsq When our government no longer compels us to purchase a product or service.
@marklangford like car insurance, car seats, fishing licenses, passports ect.
.@MlicariEsq Dude, you get this, right?
@marklangford everyone goes to the doctor at some point.

@BarackObama @mawdzi  And 69c in every tax $ goes towards the war?
@MargaretMeddow - Reminds me of Bob Marley 'war in the east, war in the west' everywhere there's a war
@mawdzi So very true; Although the present system pays lip service to peace, it waters the seeds of war.
@BarackObama @LaCina52 and yet, over the past 59 months, the rich got richer, and the poor got poorer.
@bobtesta @BarackObama I'll assume your point is NOTHING Obama dose is good enough. When in American history has the rich not gotten richer?
@LaCina52 @BarackObama I don't have a problem with riche getting richer, but with wage gap getting wider and wider. Nice assumption tho
@bobtesta @BarackObama agreed.

@BarackObama I love you so much
Sadly for working #women,
@BarackObama's @WhiteHouse has the 
WORST record of CHANGE in women's LFPR:
http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300002 …
@ITTRP what is the optimal LFPR rate for women, Keanu?
@MattCCurtis The Jan 2001 - Jun2009 median, mode & last values were all 59.5
↓ to 56.6 in Dec 2014.
Do you think that is optimal for women?
@ITTRP much of that is aging, school etc. but no one knows what's  optimal.
@MattCCurtis Don't blame ↓ LFPR on the only age group which had ↑ LFPR (age 55+).
@ITTRP I'm not saying aging & school enrollment explain the whole LFPR decline, but they're a big factor. Most ppl not in LF don't want jobs
@MattCCurtis In last 8 years, LFPR & EPR for age 55+ ↑, while 25-54 ↓
Those aging INTO 25-54 less likely to be employed than those aging OUT
@ITTRP Yep. Right. But also: 65+ population has greatly increased while the prime age population has shrunk; unquestionably bad for LFPR
@BarackObama 12 million made up jobs & 9 trillion dollars added to our debt to date! YOU'RE HILARIOUS! +2.38 billion spent a day since 2012!
@BarackObama 凄いねー
