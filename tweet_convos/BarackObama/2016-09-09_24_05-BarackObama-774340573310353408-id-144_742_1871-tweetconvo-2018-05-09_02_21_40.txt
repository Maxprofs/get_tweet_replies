Except for the calm days.
but it will kill our birds. Not
it's simple! It all comes down meat/cows!!
that could be an alternative to working in a coal mine - and healthier
: Liberals must stop using oil & coal. Use wind powered by @BarackObama speeches. @seanhannity @rushlimbaugh @KevinJacksonTBS
@BarackObama Wind and solar are more costly to the consumer.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama why is unemployment so high with all these new jobs

@BarackObama liar

@barackobama energy is the chief reason for destruction, not the kind of energy
Wow, I have been wrong about sunshine my entire life. That evil sunshine.

@FactsOnClimate
@BarackObama Let's put a tidal turbine at the base of every offshore wind tower
sure go ahead and piss away more of our money
You had 8 yrs and NOW you come out with this?. Seriously
Obama
@BarackObama ...and you come from a Basket of Corrupts ! The Pot Calling the Kettle Black ?
yea whatever
@BarackObama 160000 more jobs that it stop lying about climate change there is no proof besides uneducated scientists no
I agree and I hope so
hello good moning how are you very happy
wise decisions to make the environment conducive it is possible
.m.kol
this is great
ocean waves could be better /tidal energy needs  lot of capital in investing but its trusted and always pays off milionX
those who don't believe in climate change like some republicans don't see the benefits of wind farms.
I think this is a great way to to create jobs and do a little good for the environment, that's y we voted u 4 president
@BarackObama @TheRealStanLee @AntoineMichon1 King of the Castle, Honorable Mr. Lee figured it out a while back. Bless Them ♡
which will probably go bankrupt in a few years.
very nice..
hail renewable energy sources...
@WhiteHouse
@BarackObama and skyrocketing energy bills.. more taxes. How have they paid you and hilary?  Just between us...
Great Idea
why not scrap oil wind and solar for a clean and reusable fuel, Hydrogen? We have the means and resources to do this now!
@BarackObama charge ALOT for water consumption!
@BarackObama If these are so great, why do we see less than half running. The only thing they're good for is tax right off
Solar doesn't kill flocks of birds. Why must you lie to the people Obama?
Ask Germany how all their offshore wind turbines are working out for them.They are re-commissioning coal plants.
@BarackObama The wind of change.
the magnetic energy is clean and never ends. Try that energy and we all human will not depends from the oil and rockechilds.
watch everyone this documentary named "thrive " and you will understand what I said,  and also know about Tesla invections .
yes this is good to do , but why don't we applied free energy to everyone in the planet . I know you government can make it
wanted to try wind power was told by electric company to use solar power. That it is more reliable
Liar
@BarackObama
ههههههههه
that's what I want to wait for a job in 53 years
@BarackObama
@BarackObama good ideas
@BarackObama 
Sn başkan Savaş sonrası yıkılan yok olan evler şehirlerden kalan kirlilik kaç yılda temizlenir... saygılar
I am not sure this is best either wind
@WhiteHouse I don't see any of these windmill Farms popping up near politicians gated communities where they live
@WhiteHouse facts on climate change it's a hoax they are climate hustling wind energy & solar can never power Americas grids
have you not drive through California? Wind power has been around for many years not new technology Barry
why not just skip the turbines and burn enormous flicks of birds for energy?
support climate change
@BarackObama Mr. President please check Mr. Nikola Tesla (late) too, you might find something extra.
@BarackObama fantastic idea
@BarackObama
Colorado is windy as F. Try riding a bicycle up a big hill again strong winds.  Lol
@BarackObama ok
@WhiteHouse you forgot the billions of dollars lost on them going bankrupt.
.01% Climate change...............................
better then .00%
@WhiteHouse 
How many jobs will it cause the termination of in the other areas of power production?
@WhiteHouse 
Shredded birds, including bald eagles.
turbine bearings fail early not sustainable not #Responsible energy Wind production 1am-5am when power isnt needed
