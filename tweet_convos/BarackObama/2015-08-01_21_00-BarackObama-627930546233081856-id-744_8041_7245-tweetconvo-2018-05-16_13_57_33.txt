@WhiteHouse @POTUS It's not another Solyndra is it?
@ZDAuburn60 @WhiteHouse @POTUS 
You mean like the useless Iraq war that cost billions, took lives and caused a deficit @ZDAuburn60
@BlueKnight2016 what's real sad is Obama hasn't even gone to war and has still spent more than any other US President.
@ZDAuburn60 
Wrong,  the wars cost around 2 trillion and the deficit was reduced under Obama
@BlueKnight2016 next you're going to tell me Clinton balanced the budget while in office aren't you?
@ZDAuburn60 
He did or do you allow passion to overtake reality? If so, this discussion is mute. I prefer fact over fiction.
@BlueKnight2016 if you did some research you would find facts. Instead of believing everything the libs tell you.
@ZDAuburn60 
I'm a scientist, all I deal with are facts not FOX

@WhiteHouse We should probably #ActOnIsis or #ActOnPlannedParenthood you know, stuff that matters a bit more.
@whelms21 planned parenthood matters more than the safety of our life on earth? You idiot
@mattieokane If you can give me scientific proof of global warming and its harmful effects, we'll talk...
@whelms21 "this isn't opinion, it's fact, backed up by years of collected data" did you ever take a science class?
@mattieokane And most scientists now agree global warming is a farce, continue to trust your state mandated texts over independent findings
@whelms21 you sound so dumb haha
@mattieokane How so? You told me to "trust middle school" science, I cite modern-day science and I'm dumb? Not until you give facts
@mattieokane The most doomsday estimates say hat maybe in 300 years the world might be warmer. The U.S. won't be around then.
@WhiteHouse @MoresSchindler @POTUS Espérons que la marque OBAMA sera déterminante;qu'elle pourra continuer à agir après la fin de son mandat
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS it's called weather. Our earth goes through heating and cooling cycles frequently, don't make a bigger deal.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS More #socialism and more #failedpolicies. Your legacy will be that you were worse than Carter. #GIVEUP
@MRVvoort @WhiteHouse @POTUS you mean Bush don't you
@BlueKnight2016 Have never heard Bush called worse than Carter. Did he raise debt to $18 TRILLION? #FOODSTAMPS to 46M? @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@MRVvoort @WhiteHouse @POTUS 
The wars account for most of that.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS Why is the GOP threatening higher electric bills when our planet is at stake?
@WhiteHouse @SciencePorn @POTUS "Lowering energy bills." Yeah right. Read "Energy poverty." Don't do anything your successors can't correct.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I guess climate change is more of a danger to us than ISIS Stunt Boy !
@WhiteHouse @SciencePorn @POTUS If wind turbines & solar panels are the answer, this administration is about to blight your landscape.
@WhiteHouse @SciencePorn @POTUS Affix your jockstrap and place a hand on your wallet.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS More egotistical moves by the President. It will cost those who can least afford it with higher energy costs.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS take more time about Iran and God will deal with climate change
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  4 years of a drought in Southern California is a wake up call to me of climate change.  We need to respect our planet.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS  The #CleanPowerPlan is not worth the paper it is printed if it doesn't promote nuclear fusion energy as solution to CO2.

@WhiteHouse @helgavanleur @POTUS go #republicans. Save the world.
I'm a big fan of @POTUS but appalled to hear him contrasting "fact" and "opinion". There's terrible conceptual confusion there. @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @POTUS PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY USE MORE NUCLEAR ENERGY. please. It's cleaner and more effective than wind and solar
@WhiteHouse @SciencePorn @POTUS i wonder if it will be a law that everyone despite ability to pay mist use and slave for it
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  @POTUS How about the whole world and not just america or the U.S.? Good step but it probably won´t do much.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS How do you expect us to get more energy out to people when you keep cutting the source. Electric prices will skyrocket

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS We know how the POTUS and clean energy initiatives go...Solyndra? Where's our money?
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS So, really? If you like your electricity, you can keep you electricity? Regulating USA back to candlelight & horses.
@WhiteHouse @creativeness @POTUS so we act on a lie vs the real threats to humanity and especially America.
@IsbillPhoto More info, which is the lie and what are the real threats, in your opinion?
@creativeness climate change is the lie and Islamic Terrorism, lack of a domestic energy production plan, illegal immigration and more.
@IsbillPhoto I can't prove anything either way, but I do see #people #destroying the #ecosystem every day.
@creativeness I believe we need conservation but we don't need such abusive and damaging legislation to do so.
