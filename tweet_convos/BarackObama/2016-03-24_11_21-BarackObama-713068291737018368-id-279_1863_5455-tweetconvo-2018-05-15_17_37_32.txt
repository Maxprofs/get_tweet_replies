@BarackObama that's a Damn lie.
@BG_NOLA have some respect. You are addressing your Commander in Chief
@DrEdWild @BG_NOLA when will @POTUS  show some respect for us? To gain respect you must give it.
@rjollman by which logic, you have to show him respect if you expect to get it in return
@DrEdWild he works for me, that's where the respect has to start.
@rjollman what proportion of his salary do you pay?
@DrEdWild I do well, and I pay MORE then my "fair share". So what are you saying, He doesn't work for We The People?
@rjollman if you earn twice the national average, you contribute 1 cent to his salary. You don't own him nearly enough to disrespect him

The Senate should give a fair hearing for Judge Garland. 
Americans are sick and tired of Republicans' intimidating maneuvers.

@BarackObama - Anything new with the Republicans in Congress? They have overstepped their congressional responsibilities. Obstinate.
@BarackObama I get it but it's not realistic. Don't worry, Hillary will just nominate someone more liberal. Ah, politics.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I recognize this is America, but someone needs to have the power to FIRE Republicans who block the democratic process!!!
@BarackObama I trust the American Senate is independent. It should thus be fair and firm to the nominee, irrespective of party interests.
