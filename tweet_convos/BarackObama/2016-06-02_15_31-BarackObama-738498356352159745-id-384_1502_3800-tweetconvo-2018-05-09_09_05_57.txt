civilians should ban guns. different perceptions will have different behavior. something bad is forbidden, consult the people.

If these teachers and employers are taught the art of disarming the perpetrators when the warning signs are visible.
How does a person defuse a irrational person? Our schools and workplace need training in dealing with people.
people everywhere are ignoring the signs or do not have training in recognizing the red flags that these people are waving
@OFA totally agree. 100%
