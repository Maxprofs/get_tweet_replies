Joyous Kawanzaa, President Obama. I used to say Merry Christmas until Trump used it as a political tool to brainwash #Cult45 and "fine" Evangelicals decided to thrust a lunatic upon us. NOPE. No more Christmas until Christ returns to Christians. Happy Chanukah. 
Thank you Mr President
Merry Christmas to you and your family, as well as George W. Bush and his wife, Bill Clinton and Hillary  George H. W. Bush and Barbara, Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter.
 It's often thankless and never perfect, but in each attempt, you showed your own grace and passion. God Bless Trump!
 Merry Christmas to you & your family Obama Sir
