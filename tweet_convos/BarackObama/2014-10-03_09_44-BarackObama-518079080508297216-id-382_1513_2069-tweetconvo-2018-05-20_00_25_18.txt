@McInnesWithNoG Hey Juan, do you understand how unemployment rate is calculated?
I don't feel like explaining it to him “@twentee7: @McInnesWithNoG Hey Juan, do you understand how unemployment rate is calculated?”
@McInnesWithNoG Just asking because the unemployment number is far from the whole story... not that it justifies the other guy's hostility
@twentee7 very hostile! For no reason though. You would think Obama killed his mom or something lol #blesshisheart
@McInnesWithNoG well he's a Boston sports fan...

What's the participation rate? How many have given up looking @BarackObama? How many r living off your handouts? #ActOnJobs cc: @WhiteHouse
@BarackObama I don't think that this number covers the underemployed or housewives, only people receiving unemployment benefits.
@BarackObama Counting LONG term unemployed who's benefits stopped so you stopped counting them, it's 12.6% per Forbes
http://www.forbes.com/sites/louisefron/2014/08/20/tackling-the-real-unemployment-rate-12-6/ …
@BarackObama RT @PDXOnTheMove Despite good jobs report, it's not all about the unemployment rate. Overall economic outlook is less promising
@BarackObama Because how many LONG TERM unemployed maxed out benefits & fell off the count, thus lowering the %? SMOKE & MIRRORS

@BarackObama #Dem policies FAILED to reduce total unemployment. You're not fooling anyone this economy is not so good http://portalseven.com/employment/unemployment_rate_u6.jsp?fromYear=2000&toYear=2014 …
@BarackObama what is the participation rate?  Data can say almost whatever you would like.  If both are consistent, were good.........  Not.
@BarackObama How are these stats calculated? I ran out of unemployment benefits and am still unemployed 3 years later-not by choice
@BarackObama. Uste. Abla. En. Espanol
@BarackObama #ActOnJobs
@BarackObama I don’t think you’re in any position to take credit for that.
@BarackObama Sur when you no longer count those who have run out of benefits or no longer look for work, everything looks rosy
“@BarackObama: Progress: The unemployment rate just fell to 5.9%, the lowest rate since July 2008. #ActOnJobs” Let's keep this up America
@BarackObama 看不懂
.@BarackObama You own this statistic: Smallest percentage of Americans working in 40 years.
“@BarackObama: Progress: The unemployment rate just fell to 5.9%, the lowest rate since July 2008. #ActOnJobs” THANKS, OBAMA
@BarackObama However just because you finally found a job doesn't mean it will be enough to live on; thank God for Food Stamps & Heat Assist
@BarackObama thanks to hardworking overpaying tax business people, not your worthless cumbersome policies, #phony
@BarackObama get the rest of your cabinet and congressional Dems to help you spread the word.
