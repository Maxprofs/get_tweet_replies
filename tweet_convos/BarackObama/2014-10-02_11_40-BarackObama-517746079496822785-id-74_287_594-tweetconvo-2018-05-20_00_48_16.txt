@BarackObama Why not force congress to approve Unemployment Extensions.  Many many people including myself were really hurt.
@BarackObama Where?
@BarackObama Our policy rose 5% a year before ACA. It's now risen 200% in 7 months & will rise again in 2015. Do people believe this stuff?
@BarackObama but what about Ebola?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama healthcare where u go to doctor and they let u leave in pain from kidney stone
@BarackObama hello
@BarackObama  That is a LIE!!!
@BarackObama congratulations
@BarackObama. Nigeria is growing faster than america in health care
@StevieCbaby LOL
@BarackObama 123.
@barackobama
“@BarackObama: "Today, we have seen a dramatic slowdown in the rising cost of health care." —President Obama #AmericaLeads” that's not true?
@BarackObama what great dill,you have done in the health sector,reform is the only change needed,in most sectors of government.
@BarackObama They are already high! You are delaying another increase until after the midterm elections
@BarackObama *Im a #type1diabetic ,since obamacare started my prescriptions cost so much more now. Having a job &...*
@BarackObama leads? You're waaaayyyy behind.
@BarackObama Amen. Thanks
@BarackObama *Maybe for some. But ever since the new health thingy u got started. My insurance increased each script $20 more to compensate.
@BarackObama no we haven't
@BarackObama lol who exactly is America leading in healthcare costs http://www.forbes.com/fdc/welcome_mjx_mobile.html …
@BarackObama Are you kidding me Barack? You eat with that mouth!
Dramatic like in the sense of an NBA foul flop? MT @BarackObama"We have seen a dramatic slowdown in the rising cost of health care."
@BarackObama Hard work equals excellent results! #Rockstar
@BarackObama That is simply false!
@BarackObama what happened Mr President?
hey sir @barackobama you know indonesia,
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Thank you Sir. I am proud to call you President. Stay Safe and God Bless. —TheFutureOfFilms
@BarackObama Because , low cost healthcare most often leads to over medication and forceful improper diagnosis :-)
@BarackObama #America will always lead
@BarackObama Bullshit.
.@BarackObama is being selective with facts. I had to cancel my family's @MetroPlusHealth because it's too expensive, and going up in '15.
@BarackObama @MetroPlusHealth By the way, I love the idea of the ACA, but the options out there -- at least for New Yorkers -- are woeful.
@BarackObama Американцы слишком много бегают, а надо книги читать и мозгами работать.
@BarackObama  Sir it is more important to see appropriate medication than cost reduction in health care:-)
Due to the recession and no other reason. @BarackObama
@BarackObama ...give it time, its gonna fail
@BarackObama Thank you Mr. President! Your record speaks for itself while Republican record of shameless obstructionism speaks for itself.
@BarackObama hahaha. Maybe you have, but surely not on this end. It's higher. And insurance pays less.
@BarackObama all my God that's a nice one mr president!
@BarackObama Translation: "Things still getting worse, just not as fast."
@BarackObama This is true if everyone switches from Gold and Silver to the Bronze plans and if Ebola can kill off the elderly all the better
@BarackObama Maybe thats because were marrying gays. AIDS
@BarackObama #AmericaLeads:  it is great...but what is of concern is that such milestones are not being reflected in the polls :-(
@BarackObama That's because Doctors and hospitals have done away with thousands of nursing JOBS!
@BarackObama Health should not be a problem of money, drugs too much, care too, even at home
.@BarackObama why did my deductible go up 30% this year?
@BarackObama well done mr president,i salute u and ur policies
go nawaz go. @barackobama
