Joe Biden, awesome person. He actually went to Ukraine to check it out&knows to stand up to the Russians
@attn "Not to let the constitution function"? You know very little about our Constitution. Or, you do,and don't give a shit

@ney_gallegos  what I was trying to explain the last time

SCOTUS decisions should not be political but sadly are because we put too many politicians on the court playing judges
YEAH FINALLY SOME COMMON SENSE. which u all lack a lot of!
we need to unify as a nation. After all is the great USA we are talking about!
@BarackObama @VP
More Proof of a Rebuke of Your Dictatorial Executive Actions Like None Other of Any President #Fail #OpenBorders #Amnesty
excellent 
@attn 
Hope it means we send them back to their own country. They don't fight for their own country don't want them in ours
Thank sweet baby Jesus we can block your nominations. The country would be a complete shithole if you got your way 
Absolutely #Asinine
A 4/4 split is NOT absolute chaos, and we already have different laws in different parts of the county.
your pathetic. you got turned down because you dont respect the office of @POTUS we are a democracy not dictatorship
Hello! Obama! Do you know the Pokemon that Gaburiasu ? I would love !
how come you never  mention the situation in South Africa? 800000 people living in squatter camps.
Baloney propaganda
you leftist seem to pick and choose what works for you instead of being honest and consistent
what a lying hypocrite you don't care about the Constitution and you don't uphold laws it's currently on the books
They are not justices they are a bunch of outdated in for life leaches on our society who sway with the prevailing wind.
It means Republicans should get the hell outta the way & approve your Supreme Court nominee, NOW!

Congress should #DoTheirDamnJob Or resign!  We're paying them.
Just have Sotomayer sit this one out. Maybe she can answer phones or get coffee for the other justices while they decide.
Joe Biden what an embarrassment! https://youtu.be/OIT3jUrNTX0 
ABSOLUTE CHAOS because you democrats are IN THE WHITE HOUSE !!
YOU and BARACK had the MAJORITY in the HOUSE .... WHY DIDNT YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN ?!!
You Greedy SOB's Dont's get it. We the People come First. This is why  Donald J.Trump Will Be Our Next President.
@attn Here what the truth is. The court ruled against your illegal actions for the criminal illegals you meant to help
Means Supreme Court Justices are more likely to vote politics  than correctly interpret law.
God longs for mankind welfare, with  balance.
hey snap out of it Obummer can't make law

@attn No one except liberal pussies gives two fucks about you Obama or your circle jerk buddy, Biden. #Useless
The US Supreme Court is insulting in some ways by even agreeing to hear cases with only 8 Justices.
@BarackObama @VP
I hope it means that it will keep the dangerous ones out.

@attn It means personally to me that as a nation we are still stalled as the people get more angry. Where's the compromise?
the questions not have answers hear
you like to talk bigotry let's talk about the poor officer in Ferguson who's life you ruined because of your bigotry
all lives do matter not just minorities so a thug is a thug regardless of color. You only see one color and creating hate!

@attn An even-numbered Supreme Court might as well be no Supreme Court.
the US is a Republic of States, not a Federal Democracy ran by bureaucrats.

of course they will fuss, You got them spoil
before you leave office. Could you change on job application and whatever else, to Native American instead of American Indian?
help the congolese people(DRC)for democratie,and organisation election for 2016.THX
Immigrants help grow the economy and they are just seeking a better in life in America.
@attn I hope the Senate will reconsider
I think the Supreme Court made a huge mistake on immigration. I hope they change their minds and revote on this issue.
Justice Sir! Hilary should invite you take the SC vacancy,an appropriate answer to Trumpism.
@BarackObama @VP
God bless you sir i appreciate so much my regards to your family.
@BarackObama @VP
what about the #secondamendment your trying to abolish. Last time I checked that was still protected by the constitution 
I'm not American but Pres Obama is the best leader I've listened to

@BaileyHussung not that I disagree - the Senate should vote on Merrick. This is just factually stupid
@BaileyHussung so many things wrong with this but all I'll say is that at numerous times SCOTUS has had an even # of Justices

@attn i like to mdm Hilary as ur next and not Trump
@attn congratulations fr ur kind efforts ..sarat1234pussewala srilanka
when supreme court started there were only 6 judges on SC, and an even # of judges prevents close reactionary rulings
Ghana, your thoughts?
@attn it means we need to enforce the laws on the books and ship ILLEGALS back to their country of origin!
If only the court would quit ruling on party ideology and rather do as it was supposed to do and rule based purely on law.
