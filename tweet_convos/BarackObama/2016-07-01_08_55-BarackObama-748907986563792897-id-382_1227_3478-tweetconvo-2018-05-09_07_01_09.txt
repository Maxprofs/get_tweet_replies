funny I can't even afford it! Affordable care act my ass
If #Obamacare is such a huge success as you claim, why must you tell us about it repeatedly?
Why did I lose my plan? Why did my deductible go from $1500 to $6300 for less coverage?
U lack understanding. Obama shoved #ACA down our throats causing added expense to ins co who pass it to consumer.
@voxdotcom Yes! Thank you Sir for your leadership. The best. #Salute
Thank you best President ever.
@voxdotcom even 4rd t I don't tt tt
the healthcare has got to where I can't get my diabetic meds that's wrong Obama if I can't get my meds I'm done for
yet a mandate is still necessary? Try removing the tax mandate. I'd love to see how many people elect to stay insured.

@voxdotcom crock of bullshit.
@voxdotcom your kidding right?
bullshit!! I can't get decent care & every one I know is nickel and dimed with healthcare.
@voxdotcom up chief what I retain it is that in priority even one us cared it is applause meter thanks excellence
My premium has gone up 500% times and my coverge has fallen by 1/3.
@voxdotcom but still going up uncontrollably.  We NEED single payer health insurance.  #Greens16 #JillStein #JillNotHill
what is single payer health insurance?
We should have universal healthcare.  The richest country in the world is one of the worst to the majority of its citizens.
@voxdotcom and insurance rates for people who work went up 40%.

Great job Resident Obama, another pustule on America.
@voxdotcom when your mouth opens i could smell the crap Obama
I call bullshit. I had great insurance before, now I can't afford it.
insurance companies are paying less putting more cost on the payer and less uninsured = more Medicaid. Deductible up over %100
it seems this is an obfuscation, heathcare spending and healthcare insurance spending isnt the same thing. Thats my impression
You are a failure & worst Prez in history. Obamacare is largest disaster & a joke. You will be known as a failed "do nothing"
no bitch, it's killing us...No one will hire full time...I'm denied insurance...obamacare doesn't pay claims &collects premiums

@realDonaldTrump @TheDonaldNews Really? Mr President : I would have to be hit by a Truck before I can go to ER! Thanks
#international_investigation_karada
@voxdotcom Guess you don't realize just HOW MANY young people cannot begin to afford "Obamacare". Step out of your ivory tower.
/U.S. needs a strong health-care system/study Ontario Canada's system/

LYING crock of horse manure Obama talking obamacare worst economic disaster American history
read the last few sentences of the health care article.
May “Our Force Be With You!”,  http://diycolours.com 
@PamLRodman @voxdotcom Of course if you enforce mandatory health insurance with punishment the uninsured rate drops. Fascism.
That is because less people are using the emergency room as a doctors visit  http://www.examiner.com/article/expanding-medicaid-for-a-healthier-louisiana …
@voxdotcom yeah because the government is paying for it.
@voxdotcom Could it be because people quit going to Drs. because good medical  treatment is non-existent? Now I am very ill!
Obamacare in collapsing under it own weight.  Its a giant failure, your failure.
BUT, THE PREMIUMS ARE UP, UP, AND AWAY !!!!!!!!!!!!
WE GOTT GAME  here at http://easycolorexpress.com 
Please stay away from Hillary or I just can't respect you.
Yea if its so great why R all the insurance companies leaving U? All that's left is shitty HMO & they're charging double 4 it.
My health insurance truly has increase 500%. No joke.
R U seriously this freaking delusional??  I am paying more than I ever have and guess what?  I lost my damn doctor

@voxdotcom wish you would mandate insurance companies to cover all autism treatment etc.In Utah the cost 4 autism is killing us
IF healthcare spending's slowed @BarackObama @WhiteHouse it's only bc premiums have risen so dramatically thanks to O'care #repealobamacare
thank you
What a crock of shit Barry.
@voxdotcom yea he gave insurance to illegal immigrants and the American ppl paid for it.
Before obamacare 3500 now 8000
Thanks
Great start to rising medical costs but still so much more to do!
my son still can't afford his premium. Just praying he doesn't get sick .
CHIP-IN WITH US! http://easycolorexpress.com 
Congrats!  
Also, the removal of excluding pre-existing conditions has saved so many lives <3
I still wish we could've gotten the taxpayer setup, but thankful nonetheless that you've helped make it easy!
nice
Thank you for being the Best President ever!!
@voxdotcom what a joke. High deductibles and premiums and the smarter younger generation opting for penalty. Failed legacy
You use Medicare money to support this BS. SS didn't even get a raise this yr. (What do you care?) My insr premiums go up, up,
my conpay went from 1500 to 5000. Monthly premium for myself and husband is 900 month. Nuts.
Your full of BS. 5 grandchildren and they can't find jobs. U need to Stop all illegal immigrants. Where are the jobs Mr. Pres??
@voxdotcom yes it is sir
@voxdotcom great job. Think of what could have been accomplished if congess worked WITH you
@voxdotcom I heard ridiculous comment and since VA refused to do proper film like burbs watching in the burbs, decided go civ.
Sure, enough all clear by VA mammogram which denied film needed, turned out bad civilian like in burbs
@voxdotcom I'm spending more out of pocket with 5 types of insurance but receive actual health care.  Sometimes,one has feeling
but major carriers are dropping Obama care and the deductibles are much much too high
thank god, well done you brilliant human being xx
OUR deductible sky rocketed ass hat
Obamacare equals the Needs of the Many Outweigh the needs of the Few.
The reason spending has gone down is because deductibles are so high, no one can afford to access the ACA.
And the deductibles & premiums have skyrocketed! Stop lying!
@voxdotcom your the best
Thank you Mr. President for your love for, and service to this great country. Good bless you and the United States of America
@voxdotcom obamacare is a complete failure. Copays have skyrocketed premiums have skyrocketed. Government waste
And my health insurance premiums have gone up astronomically
@voxdotcom so not true, nobody asked me!! I cant afford!!! With MS!!!!
not ture That's how out of touch Obama is w/the working class. He's  made it very difficult for the average person 2 b
Insured
I don't like being forced to pay for medical insurance that I cannot afford and get penalized come IRS time! #Obamacare
“@BarackObama:  #Obamacare passed, health care spending  slowed—and the uninsured rate is down 2an all-time low.OOP bills r killing me#help
Now to hold companies responsible for taking advantage of the ACA & price gouging! ACA; Great! Costs after? Shameful moneygrab!
@voxdotcom Yes. Yes
@voxdotcom Awesome!
this is such a lie. Just because you make a statement doesn't make it truth. All you hear  in the real world is how awful it is
@voxdotcom All those immoral avaricious corrupt healthcare cartel goons are haaaating this. Barack=Best President Ever.
@voxdotcom more lies a habitual lier habitually lying
"less than expected" So Obamacare wasn't quite as bad was we thought it would be? Not as much of a price increase as expected??
@voxdotcom and no one is gethin halthcare on Obama care
@APRN1119 Wish we could have single-payer. Some of my friends r still uninsured, underinsured, or going broke.
بومب
Great work, Mr. President!!
Tea so is hours on the clock at work, companies dont want to pay for insurance so they keep as many as can with 25 h or less
yea not tea sorry
saved my wife's  life as we couldn't get insurance because of a pre-existing condition, I get my healthcare from the VA
thank you
@voxdotcom it's true, i can keep more money in my pocket, great H/C, great job,great life and I'm happy, since you became PRES
@voxdotcom you're so delusional..u actually think you've done such a great job.
@voxdotcom I need President Obama to get me VA disability for exacerbated PTSD. I have tried every Avenue with no luck :-(
I am sorry sir but since the ACA was put in place my health care costs have sky rocketed going from a 1K to a 5K deductible.
I don't know about anyone else but my middle class family is spending $6k/year more than 8 years ago smh
@voxdotcom no one should ever blame Obama
@realDonaldTrump $21,500 for a family of 4. Yes, obama care is a wonderful thing. Nice graph though.
thank you for your leadership forget the negative comments Sir and take a bow or pat yourself on the back!! Great Prez & family
So that's why my health insurance cost almost tripled!
@voxdotcom amen you are a great president i don't care what anyone says.
Obamacare has saved my health, my financial security and my sanity! :-) Thank you!!

@voxdotcom spending is down because most of us can't afford even basic care due to the ridiculously high deductibles!
what about that executive order signed on my bday? Of march 16 2012 it was order 60613 I beleive. Y?
@voxdotcom @my1voice56 It's not perfect but it's so much better than b4. Thank you Mr. President
stop lying to yourself with these deceitful statistics
@voxdotcom Before the law it was cheaper to buy insurance on one's own.
@voxdotcom excellent job sir.full
 Marks
demographics tell us The Eyes see more than The Nose majority who are forced to watch any given projection Sir
@voxdotcom when I tried to get insurance on my own I couldn't afford it. My wife is slave to her job cuz of the insurance.
more good news!  Keep it comin'
@voxdotcom Yay!!  So proud to have you as our leader.  One step closer!  I love you, President Obama!
spending less than an imaginary "expert" forecasted number.  My insurance immediately went up $700/mo.  I am not alone.
you mean they expect to pay less? this is only medicaide/Medicare spending - ACA shifted the burden to the private insurance!
@voxdotcom Thank you Mr. President.  You are a blessing to the nations.
well done
I pay more now than I did before Obamacare and it continues to increase every year. In fact now I can barely afford it at all.
@voxdotcom My daughter can't afford her insurance. Can't get help since she lives with me. Choosing between health or shelter.
yeah that's because me and everyone is afraid to go to the doctor because of what it costs
Um, nice graph. Too bad reality doesn't match that. Go Google high deductible insurance plans. I'm a victim of that.
and I am spending a ton to pay for this mess.
