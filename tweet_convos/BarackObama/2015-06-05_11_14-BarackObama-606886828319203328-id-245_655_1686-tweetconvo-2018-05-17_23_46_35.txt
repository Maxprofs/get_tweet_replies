@BarackObama Where? People doesn't see,we're feeling economy goes bad,and then?
@BarackObama Any time horizon much farther out than that, though, and things look a LOT shakier.
@BarackObama And as long as we keep people focused on evaluating economic health 1 month at a time, we're in golden shape.
@BarackObama  as long as the cost of everything doesn't go up.  Which it will.
