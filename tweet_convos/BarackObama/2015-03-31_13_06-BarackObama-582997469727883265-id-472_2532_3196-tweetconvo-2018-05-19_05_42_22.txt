@BarackObama “There is no such thing as consensus science. If it’s consensus it isn’t science. If it’s science, it isn’t consensus. Period.”
@BarackObama "the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics." Michael Crichton

@BarackObama "the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels" Michael Crichton
@BarackObama @SarahLudford More importantly, 100% of scientists who are right agree with this.
@BarackObama You make no sense. You believe the fictitious 97% but think that nature's 96% contribution to CO2 is irrelevant?
@BarackObama then talk to China about that you dumb bastard
.Hi @BarackObama why did you allow #Shell to go for oil in the arctic, pretty inconsistent, isnt it? http://fuelfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/shells-arctic-drilling-plans-on-track-as-obama-administration-oks-lease-sale/ …

Quit using that tired old 97% number, proven to be erroneous, like #ActOnClimate, numerous times @BarackObama. It's all a hoax caused by $
@BarackObama Should we de-emphasize use of hydrocarbons? My 5th period science class just sent you letters urging you to ban #fracking
@BarackObama Actual debate centers on how much carbon dioxide does an extra 3 billion people make? #stopmakingpeople
@barackobama due to recent happening scientist are skeptical to what really causes climate change. u know polar vortex.
