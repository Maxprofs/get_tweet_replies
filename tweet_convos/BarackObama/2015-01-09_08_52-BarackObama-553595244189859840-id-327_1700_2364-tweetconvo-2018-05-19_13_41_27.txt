@BarackObama Look at the labor force numbers
@partiallypro @BarackObama why is that a government issue?
@rufflanguage @BarackObama it's not, but if you tout unemployment you should look at why the rate has fallen, which is labor force shrinkage
@partiallypro @BarackObama the rate at one point was 10%. Now its 5.8%. That type of drop doesn't happen because people stop looking.
@rufflanguage @BarackObama the labor participation rate is as low as it was in the 1970s. It's a big chunk of the fall.
@partiallypro @BarackObama that labor rate argument is dead. There's no 4.2% drop because people aren't looking for work. #Irrational
@rufflanguage @BarackObama I don't think you understand what you're saying, it's not an "argument" it's a real problem. Ask an economist.
@partiallypro @BarackObama I know what I'm saying. People not wanting to work is an issue, but that is not hindering job creation.
@BarackObama how many was full time jobs !!
@BarackObama you truly suck
@BarackObama yassssss throw them facts OBAMA
@Harajuku__Lala @BarackObama Fact: The rate is dropping because people gave up looking. Counting those, TRUE rate is still over 8%. #wakeup
.@BarackObama You never talk about the millions who've left the workforce. Real unemployment keeps getting worse & worse. #Shameless.
@BarackObama  wat! U r joking mr president wake up and do someting for ur country or else......

@LunaticLabs @BarackObama Um, dvd has been replaced by blu-ray and digital download. Petro isn't. Going anywhere soon.
@Rntng_Scssnst @BarackObama That's my point, we need to move away from oil if we want to corner the next market and create well paying jobs.
@LunaticLabs @BarackObama agreed. Nothing lasts forever.
@Rntng_Scssnst @BarackObama glad we agree, that's how foreign cars outsold domestic they saw a high mpg emerging market and cornered it.
