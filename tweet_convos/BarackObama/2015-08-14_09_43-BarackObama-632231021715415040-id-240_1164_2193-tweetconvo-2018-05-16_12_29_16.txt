@BarackObama please don't talk about the U.S. Marines. You are trash and don't respect the military. U are a joke as a commander in chief.
@MarinePhillyTom @BarackObama I wouldn't call any human being 'trash', let alone POTUS. Foul language.

@MarinePhillyTom @BarackObama I see you're struggling to understand 'social media'.
@arembooks @BarackObama I see you are still writing when no one asked u.
@MarinePhillyTom @BarackObama I see you still don't understand social media.

@BarackObama so sad that #Obama has no problem doing business with persecutors,thugs and murderers in #Cuba. #tcot #tlot #ycot #ccot
