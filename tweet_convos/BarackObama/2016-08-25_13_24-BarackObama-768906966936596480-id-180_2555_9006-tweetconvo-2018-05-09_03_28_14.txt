Protect Bears Ears in Utah, please.

He is also the first president in history to act as God making unnatural acts a norm & a right !!!??
One can't or shouldn't change the order of nature. One can choose. But making such a law. Very questionable!!
These statements aren't about hate. It's about continuing life in the only way possible. Man and woman.
