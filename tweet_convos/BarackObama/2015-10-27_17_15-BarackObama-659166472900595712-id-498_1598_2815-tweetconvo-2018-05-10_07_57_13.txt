@WhiteHouse @POTUS Grubering again...compare Chicago to Houston nimrod!
@MRVvoort @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@AlphaRomeo223 No... Just... No.
@AlphaRomeo223 More like you're full of weapons-grade BS. It is facepalm inducing.
@AlphaRomeo223 So universal background checks would disarm you? Gee, wonder why that may be? Are you not a law abiding citizen?
@whitehouse @potus I would disagree.  I have my rights.  Back off.
@StevenDiMartino @WhiteHouse @POTUS Well then you'd be wrong, because if more guns = safer the US would be the safest country on Earth.
@iybraesil1987 @whitehouse @potus Well actually, statistically we are in terms of violent crime.
@StevenDiMartino So you're happy that more Americans have died from guns since Sandy Hook than died in Vietnam?
@iybraesil1987 Another foreigner that doesn't live here.  WOHO.
@StevenDiMartino Answer the question: So you're happy that more Americans have died from guns since Sandy Hook than died in Vietnam?
@Iybraesil1987 oh and the data you are using is wrong. When you get older learn how to read.
@StevenDiMartino http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/04/15/1377947/-82-033-Gun-Deaths-Since-Sandy-Hook-Infographic …

82,033 Gun Deaths Since Sandy Hook 

58,307 dead in Vietnam.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS thank u for speaking the truth. 89 Americans die daily from gunshot injuries. #enough. #gunsense
@commongunsense @WhiteHouse @POTUS You & Whitehouse do know that most of those are suicides where are voluntary, LEGAL & state authorized?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS so true time to attack the industry making money from it & citizens lives
@Jackerouac64  Second amendment protects the first amendment. You ready to attack that as well,,,,
@butforthe why not?
@Jackerouac64  How about it would inhibit the very thing that you're  doing now.  Be real,,,,
@butforthe I'm not from the U.S. & I read your bio & thought I'd go sarcasm as well it's a complex issue but you guys need 2 start
@Jackerouac64  What's complex issue, first and second amendments or sarcasm?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS usa understand it very late but no action.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  I'm pretty sure that the first thing hitler did was to make citizens defenseless...
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Thank you!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS WE THE PEOPLE SAY more guns in the homes of good people will be safer crime rate way down your lying
@WhiteHouse @POTUS either do you cannot wait till your time is up
@WhiteHouse  When law-abiding citizens surrender their guns, they'll be ruled by crooks,criminals, thugs and gang bangers. Not so utopian,,,
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS oulad  coure  souf  ki sa
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I suppose you think more government does make us safer right mr president? Your a demagogue to the very core
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS That's a big lie guns do make it safer for law abiding citizens you need to quit lying about gun control.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS disagree
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS YOUR LYING IT DOSE MAKE IT SAFER LEAVE OUR GUNS ALONE!!! YOUR TRYING CONFISCATE OUR GUN. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS if you don't take the gun off the street your not going to stop anything.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS now maybe u better understand how vegans feel about your own disconnect Mr. President. Enjoy your steak.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS So true Mr. President!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS WE THE PEOPLE SAY your lying taking gun form innocent people will open doors for more violence
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Un like you the sheriffs all over the us uphold the constitution and they will stand there ground.
Guns in the proper hands do. @WhiteHouse @CAPgunsandcrime @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS That is ture.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama no, but more guns in law abiding citizens homes do.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS states with low gun ownership exs.. NY Illinois, have the worst crime rates
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  it's not the case that having guns in a community makes the community  unsafe, it's who has the guns.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Americans are killing America.America is not SAFE to travel .Be Alert.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS less thugs and muslims hell bent on jihad makes us safer
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS then why do you have the secret service, dumb ass?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 1:07 citation needed

@WhiteHouse @POTUS you're wrong again but no one is surprised.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS if guns dont make things
Safer how come all security around
The whitehouse has guns hmmmm?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
I beg to differ with our President...More gun laws will not prevent tragedy. Criminals/crazy people do not follow laws.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  What are you going to do, have a war on guns, like a war on drugs? doesn't work! #getreal
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS You scared the hell out of the Police...Who's  left to Protect Citizens? I'll keep my guns ...screw you!
@WhiteHouse @fight4women @POTUS more cannabis arrests than any other president. 90% of drone strikes kill the innocent.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@WhiteHouse you were quoted in an article by @newscomauHQ
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Guns are huge problem. But guns + mental illness = tragedies. Focus on mental illness too. www  http://CaitlynJennerForPresident.com 
@WhiteHouse no law will stop a criminal, that's why we call them criminal !! Duh
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  yes Mr. Pres. It does if it's easier for a good guy to get a gun.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS true.  in my town you can legally carry a gun on your hip and many do.  yet we have tons of crime.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I AGREE. Thanks america to follow european rules, for once.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS @Peppelopes2014: a beautiful song from Dean Martin http://youtu.be/8Oogs984Qlw 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 
Teach our adults the importance of family in bringing up kids as valuable future citizens and no more jails
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 
Criminals are people not animals, so we need to start basics from the value of a strong disciplined family
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Very correct Mr.President.
More guns are in the hands of the police & army in Nigeria: terror against civilians. @MB free Nnamdi Kanu @whitehouse @potus  @barackobama
@WhiteHouse @POTUS No but more
CCW's issued surely does. Take the guns off the streets and give them to responsible citizens. @NRA #GUNS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama more guns (specifically if they cost 550 mio per gun) in the air make our planet not safer!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Hypocrite
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Then Why Do You Have So Many Guns Protecting You Mr. President? #2A #GunRights #GunControl
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Gun Sales Surge Amid Refugee Crisis http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/10/28/gun-sales-surge-in-austria-amid-refugee-crisis/ … #Guns #Refugeecrisis
@WhiteHouse @POTUS More guns bring less crime everywhere. Armed citizens save 98% more Cops then Criminals kill!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Read the "ArmedCitizen" in #NRA magazines;Guns Daily save innocents/elderly!
@WhiteHouse Guns are easy to make, you cant disarm criminals, that's why having more armed citizens stops more armed crimes!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS о хуй.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @BarackObama  You spread a false reality.. y don't you start making decisions based on facts instead of for ur own agenda
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @BarackObama Look at what's happening in Chicago, obviously you communist don't go off of fact or statistics.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS neither does releasing thousands of prisoners into our neighborhoods U stupid stupid man U r killing us.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  I disagree we have rights for a reason
@whitehouse @potus if USA is not safe like Burundi, why European Union won't to send peace keepers in US for such deal?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS make them illegal and theyll go away,  like drugs.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I should have said alien life dammit! Amazing that the smartest american president for some time might b from heaven ;-)
@WhiteHouse @POTUS you can't stop people from developing mental illness but you can stop them from getting an assault rifle.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS don't listen to the arguments driven by fear ignorance and downright stupidity.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS well done potus you're acting like one would expect of a leader who cares about human life.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I have a patentable idea that'll reduce gun violence + keep gun owners happy! Did I mention-Rookie Tweeter!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I have a patentable idea that will reduce gun violence AND keep gun owners and hunters happy!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS the hypocrisy is so thick.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS #guncontrol #gunviolence this issue is exasperated by the fact that we are a violent society. #iraqwar #policestate
@POTUS #gamergate exasperating that minorities, women and children are at risk of serious harm due to lack of responsible law making. #GOP
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Keep telling yourself that. I'm safe & so is my family, just ask my Springfield & S&W
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
CRIMINALS DON'T CARE, AND BY PASS, ANY CONTROL...
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
GUNS IN HANDS OF CITIZENS IS NOT A THREAT FOR ANYONE, GUNS IN THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS THAT'S THE PROBLEM!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  i agree with your words,great Obama!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Its true i agree
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS But that's not what you do. You support the ones committing the crimes, support thugs and berate the police
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS So do something about the thug trash that is committing these crimes and support law enforcement in doing it
@WhiteHouse @MomsDemand @POTUS I think you'd be hard pressed to find an American that disagrees. guns on the streets are bad
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS In fact see what happens to crime after all the thugs you are letting out of jail start all over again.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS But fact is the minorities are causing most of the violence and crime and they get no serious repurcussions
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Why don't we put these drug dealing and violent thugs away then. Too bad they are minorities.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Finally i found you
 Mr. President, please help this Engineer

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS let's arm everyone from age seven. Everyone should be armed in schools, hospitals, churches, homes  be safe
@WhiteHouse @POTUS bullshit
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I'm sure your secret service is strapped. Get rid of them. Our lives matter just like yours
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS guns in law abiding citizens hands will so we can defend ourselves!!! You should practice what you preach
@WhiteHouse @POTUS go and teach that to the dictator @MBuhari of your Western zoo in Africa #nigeria
You've never let facts stop you from lying to the public. @WhiteHouse @POTUS  Must have no conscience. Isn't that a sign of psychopathy?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @markrowanau
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS That is truth a great truth, this big truth should be apply for Syria or for Libia!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Y don't you concern yourself with the violent police officers that are carrying guns? start regulating them
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS are you having my girl raped and photographed to control her?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS with this Speed Every one in life time Will have a schools shoting in each comunity.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama no it makes you Chicago only the criminals will have guns
@WhiteHouse @POTUS actually this should be framed "more criminals on the streets do not make you or your community safer". I can buy that.
Tell you what: You'll have more credibility for that statement when you dismiss your Secret Service detail: @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Nor do fewer guns
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I agree!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  I also think so.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it doesvfrom you
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Yes, they do - if those civilized have concealed carry permits.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS It is depend on who's hand is the gun in. If the person is responsible it is fine.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @BarackObama we all know badguys go thru checks for guns. The 2ND is there for a reason unarm folks and watch them go

@WhiteHouse @MomsDemand @POTUS Lets start by disarming the police, since they miss 80% of the time when they use their guns.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 2 things: a) Gun control b) Psychiatric observation for all police officers. Now!  #violence #PoliceBrutality #guncontrol
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Then why do you have so many following you around everyday? Take them away from us and only the bad guys will have them!
. @WhiteHouse @POTUS #gunsense relies on cherry picked data and its listeners to not do their own research
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I have been to shooting ranges but I never owned a gun. I've rented guns at the range & shoot shoot shoot
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS like the speech why not tax bullets $50 per I'm lucky to live in Scotland
@WhiteHouse @POTUS If people are mentally unstable enough to want to shoot people, they will find a way to get a gun.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  you most tell that to esraeli given...mr gons

@WhiteHouse @POTUS sooo if all guns are taken off the streets,will the police force still need to have them.their guns should be taken too!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Criminals can get guns from the Philippines via CA and your open borders.So tell us why we don't need guns?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I thought you had a high IQ for attending Harvard but you are releasing criminals/drug dealers on us!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS there are way more instances where a private citizen with a gun saved lives than took them. #StopGunViolence
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS wrong! It doesnt make the govt safer to impose freedom restrictions on the people! Be real. #StopGunViolence
