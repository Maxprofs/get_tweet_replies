@BarackObama @areyou0 TPP is a corporate con job and will mark the nadir of your legacy.
Wrong! @unStunned @BarackObama
@areyou0 @BarackObama #TPP will dampen American wages and surrender sovereignty to multinationals. What's not to like?
You're only speculating! Do you have the facts in front of you? No you don't! Wait until everything comes out! @unStunned @BarackObama
@areyou0 @BarackObama Once-sovereign nations negotiating "treaties" with multinational corporations! The secretiveness is because of shame.
Because of Obama we've had over 60 months of straight job growth you think he would destroy his legacy over the TPP @unStunned @BarackObama
@areyou0 @BarackObama It's a mystery to me why Obama would champion TPP. My last beef with him was not prosecuting wall street.  Related?
Both are two entirely separate issues!  @unStunned @BarackObama
@BarackObama @areyou0 If my representative or either senator backs #TPP their primary opponents start on 2nd base.
@BarackObama But their self employed, they earned a little more and now have to pay $1100/month. So they lose their incentive to earn more??
@BarackObama I know nothing's perfect, but their has to be something better. Maybe a transitional decrease in subsidies as income increases
@BarackObama STOP TRADING OUR LIVES AWAY!! NO TPP.  NAFTA killed our jobs, this deal will turn the US into a 3rd world impoverished country.
@Melmar11 @BarackObama so we should pay extra for inadequate & uncompetitive steel companies? FTA allows US to attain competitive advantage
@djred678 @BarackObama that's when they said about NAFTA. Where's the competitive edge?
@Melmar11 we're not spending $ on inadequate industries. Layed off workers need to get better skills & get a job. We must revamp our ed sys.
@djred678 "laid off workers" have skills. when the jobs are sent overseas it makes no difference what your qualifications are.

@BarackObama is screwing American businesses over. Taking away jobs and sending them overseas. 1.5 years left. Can't wait.
@BarackObama TPP = bad idea just like NAFTA was.
@BarackObama it's about other countries selling their products in our country with products being taxed less American products.
@BarackObama @robin182zz But wi INVERSION they evade US income taxes and deprive US economy of needed rev to secure infrastructure.
@BarackObama yeah does that mean we can export farm production.

@BarackObama This needs to be a matter of strategy
@BarackObama  Yes, it belongs to U.S. to write the trade rules of the current Global Value Chains Revolution and Trade and Prosperity age.
@BarackObama " America can't stand by and let other countries Lead on Trade. We have to step up and write free and fair trade rules".

True @BarackObama Lead2Succeed #LeadOnTrade.
