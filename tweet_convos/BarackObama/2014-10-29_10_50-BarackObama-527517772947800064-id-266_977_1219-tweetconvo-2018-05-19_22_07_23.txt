@BarackObama You must be kidding, it's weather! Nothing unusual about it.
Dear @BarackObama 
In the 16th century people became hysterical about extreme weather and started burning witches. You would have done well.
@SteveSGoddard @PMgeezer @BarackObama Yup he would have fit right in...
Dear @BarackObama 
US wildfire count is at a 30 year low. Your claim is nonsense, as always.

@BarackObama "This is climate change"? No, that is combustion. You can stop combustion with CO2. Stop oxygen now before we all burn!
@BarackObama hard to believe. Nature takes care of herself.
@BarackObama communities should be empowered in managing their own community forest and be supported in tree planting exercises
@BarackObama ...2 years after Sandy people are still homeless, good work ebola barry...
@BarackObama Soooo Sandy was a wildfire, huh?  Lol
@BarackObama 21,187 gun homicides since Sandy Hook. Post Sandy Hook gun legislation has made no difference.
@BarackObama Republicans refuse to recognize climate change because many of them are obligated to coal & oil for campaign money. Hired hands

@BarackObama        I saw you in my dreams what means that
@BarackObama Europe aims for -40% CO2. Will the US do better?
@BarackObama Yes Al Gore and the melting ice caps!  From the same guy who traded energy credits so he could fly around the world!
@BarackObama true!
@BarackObama while I am cautious to blame extreme weather on climate change. Climate change is real and needs to be addressed. Thank you!
@barackobama wawa i really feel like if even africa is the same like that mr.Honourable
@BarackObama I'm confused is this acting on protecting from harsh weather or moving towards being greener in an effort to stop this weather?
@BarackObama  در حال حاضر الان باید چی کار کنیم که دلمون نشکنه
@BarackObama,,yes sir.some climates are a menace,btw definately You are well conversant on the way to hundle it..
@BarackObama  Actually wildfires are at a very low point, maybe you should research before you tweet something else that's way wrong
@BarackObama  we need a different kind of leadership!

@BarackObama Weather can be heartbreaking and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.
@BarackObama that is a smart thought a little late but still smart!
@BarackObama maybe you should stop spending money on war then.
.@BarackObama then why the fuck didn't you OR Romney mention A SINGLE THING about it in ANY of your "productive" presidential debates? 
@BarackObama too bad Al Gore was defeated by (Florida) Bush. Maybe the world would be quite different right now
@jmavella @BarackObama YouAreA ObamaRobot
@BarackObama Not only Americans die though...
@BarackObama actually mandates won't help. Freeing up business will actually allow for innovations that reduce emmisions. Not statism.

#ActOnClimate had nothing to do w/Sandy. Maj. of wildfires are caused by direct human action. There are no "extremes" w/weather @BarackObama
@BarackObama If you would do your job or leave so some one can we might be more interested in your lies.
@BarackObama 哦
@BarackObama most part of the coastal region in Kenya are under the extreme weather until the streams are drying up.
@BarackObama sounds like a fear mongering notion to promote clean air measures by trumpeting global warming conjecture. Mythology.
