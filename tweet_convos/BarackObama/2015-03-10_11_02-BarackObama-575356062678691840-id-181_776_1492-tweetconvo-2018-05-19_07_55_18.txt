@BarackObama you may want to look at that again. Keeping raising minimum wage an it will not mean crap.
@BarackObama but the lower class doesn't want to work for a degree
“@BarackObama: "Today a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class." It won't be if everyone has the opp. to get one.
@BarackObama Not when wages are too low and student loan lenders act w/ mafia mentality but protected. Ridiculous! Middle class burden.

@BarackObama this isn't true at all. I have a degree and work 2 jobs just to pay back that tuition. #wasteofmoney
@BarackObama Got my degree this past December n I'm struggling trying to find a job to just make my bills...keeping hope though on the dream
“@BarackObama: Today a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class.” You spelled "a lifetime of crippling debt" wrong.
“@BarackObama: "Today a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class." —President Obama #CollegeOpportunity” maybe
@BarackObama if it costs a premium then it should guarantee more than just the "surest ticket".
@BarackObama I'm more broke with a college degree. $80k in loans and can't get better than a $36k job. That's not middle class. Sorry.
@BarackObama Mr. Yes good deed is the best concrete for future plans.
@BarackObama That's exactly true
@BarackObama Yet the cost of my degree has been punitive, throwing me head first into insurmountable private and federal loan debt. #FixThis
@BarackObama bullshit. Education is a money pit created by big business to sell toyotas for Enron.

@mikkygeee @BarackObama then why am I still poor and in mounds of debt ?!?!?!?! riddle me that riddler
@BarackObama would rather be 80k in the hole knowing I have a BA/ Masters. That way I can get a good job and pay that debt off.

@BarackObama mmm yo no entiendo mucho pero lo q los jovenes que estudiamos!!!!!solo queremos un titulo profecional
@BarackObama after paying back 65k in debt, the middle class has already been exported.
@BarackObama It uses to be, but now it seems to be a target, since we elected you now the insecure Pilgrims are lashing out like it's 1935.
@BarackObama there is no middle class here anymore , only very rich and extremely poor. Bring the middle class back.
@BarackObama Ten months of unemployment after four years making $1200/month after graduation says otherwise.
“@BarackObama: "Today a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class." or to being 80k in debt before you can have a legal beer
@noraaagarcia @BarackObama Yeah if there still is a job by the time get that degree
@BarackObama It's the ticket to being poor. It saddles you with a debt for the rest of your life in a job market that can't support you.
