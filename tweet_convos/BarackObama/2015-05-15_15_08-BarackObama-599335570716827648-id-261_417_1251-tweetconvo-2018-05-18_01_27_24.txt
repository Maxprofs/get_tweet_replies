.@BarackObama Had you not been so snide to Sen. Warren and her fellow (D)'s you might have gotten some support for the TPP.
@BarackObama A race to the bottom is not "leveling the playing field", it's screwing the middle class more.

@BarackObama @thehill @WhiteHouse @Senate_GOPs @JohnKerry  EnterSEA,FTA,BIA withIndia or Create TTIP&TPP LikeWith India (16%ofWorld)
@BarackObama I support many of your ideas. This is NOT one of them. Please reconsider this. These trade deals only hurt our jobs/economy.
@BarackObama US workers got "leveled" by previous trade deals. Why do you want  wages here to stagnate further while others (might) rise?
@BarackObama abajame el labio arretranco... Que te llevas un alpargatazo.
@BarackObama You're a good president for the working class DESPITE your trade policies, not because of them. ACA good, #TPP bad.
