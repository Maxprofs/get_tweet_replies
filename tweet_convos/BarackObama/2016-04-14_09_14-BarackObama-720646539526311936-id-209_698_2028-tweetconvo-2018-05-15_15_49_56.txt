@BarackObama So, why aren't you working to make CO2 free Nuclear power more prevalent in this country?
@pilotbob @BarackObama I think this will be the future. When private space becomes more developed, send radioactive waste to sun.
@CTPatsSuperFan @BarackObama also, lifting stuff even to orbit is hugely expensive and creates tons of CO2.
@pilotbob @BarackObama right but recycled waste will still have unusable elements. Shipping it to the sun eliminates environmental/security
@CTPatsSuperFan @BarackObama Too risky. what happens if one of those launches blows up?
@pilotbob @BarackObama think there are many hurdles. They first need to just get up there. Thinking of it as the main source of energy in
@pilotbob @BarackObama the future & with the increase demand from more developing nations, I think storing it would be a long term risk
@pilotbob @BarackObama should also note that Tesla innovations w their batteries could shed a lot of family energy demands to solar panels
@BarackObama No shut Sherlock!
@BarackObama Looked into this... ALL of the fires were started by human error. Most burnt less than a acre. For Obama, Lie to get results
@BarackObama especially in SoCal. It's officially fire season over here.
@BarackObama Have they ever *not* been?
@BarackObama Turn off the HARRP and stop the chemtrails and you might find natures been taking care of the planet for billions yrs still can
@BarackObama @nytimes hola señor mucho gusto en saludarlo

@BarackObama Would the wildfires be so threatening if ranchers & farmers were allowed controlled burns on rented federal land?
@BarackObama Lamentablemente es una realidad que se vive en todos los países del mundo. Necesitamos un cambio #opinomundo2016
@BarackObama @nytimes what if northern states aren't getting their fair share of forest fires?
@BarackObama Fossil Fuels and Gas Guzzling Cars are Creating this not Climate Change Burning Coal and burning Amazon,Indonesia Rain Forest.
@BarackObama @nytimes When changing the Senate and his way of thinking will not burn forests
@BarackObama  who are you Obama
@BarackObama @nytimes #climate changes
@BarackObama The sky is falling, the sky is falling!
@BarackObama Air Force predicted weather as a force multiplier in their 1996 docs. Geo Engineering is here,now, has been in China too
@BarackObama @nytimes  please run for a 3rd term
@BarackObama Climate change is normal on a rock thats flying around a burning star at god knows what speed, stop trying to blame us for it.
@BarackObama It's Mother Nature's way of telling us we're in this together.
@BarackObama   I am pretty sure we can blame all our troubles on "climate change." What a bunch of dorks. LOL
@BarackObama @nytimes 奥黑，好好干。不要怂。
@BarackObama @nytimes  then do something to make CO2 free nuclear power...
@BarackObama @nytimes hi sir
@BarackObama Why can't U pass a law, forbidding tourists 2 enter into forest areas, whose negligence is said 2 b the cause for these fires?.
@BarackObama the world changes. The dust bowl comes to mind.
@BarackObama @nytimes hey I say thank u 4 time fr temperament can ruin an funny drink
@BarackObama I do believe in climate change once you are out of the white house! Just Bout time to put out the fire you caused in the USA :/
@BarackObama Will fires have been going on for millions of years with no help from any man
@BarackObama 'The issue, environment is very important' I think so 
                 But the developing country' domestic economy lay down
@BarackObama and increasing at that. Let us bring forth helpful knowledge, and let us put advanced detection/prevention systems to action
@BarackObama @nytimes If climate change is important. Why do you dig up coal, and sell it to the Chinese?
@BarackObama communist plant
@BarackObama @nytimes  AND THAT'S NOT
ALL, CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES THE JET
STREAM TO CHANGE ITS COURSE, FLOODING

@BarackObama because we never had wild fires in the last 50 years in America have we? #ObamaStupidestPresidentEver
@BarackObama . climate change is a big hoax and science backs it up
@BarackObama @nytimes yeah. Set by members of nwo
@BarackObama Wildfires and droughts...nothing new here, move along. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama Total solar irradiance is the ONLY thing responsible for climate change, not CO2. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama $29 Billion per year of gov’t climate change grants has corrupted science beyond comprehension. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama The farce of anthropogenic global warming is speculative at best and is economically destructive at worst. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama CO2 impact on climate is radical political and environmental activism, not science. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama Climate change has been a natural earth process for billions of years without the help of humans or CO2. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama No scientific empirical causal evidence CO2 directly impacts climate in any way. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama No evidence that extreme weather events have increased in frequency or severity in the past 100 years. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama From http://NIFC.gov ... #StopScammingAmerica

@BarackObama perhaps we should consider more logging so there isn't so much of an overgrowth that creates more severe wild land fires.
@BarackObama @nytimes no such thing its called 4 seasons Einstein
