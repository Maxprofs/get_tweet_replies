@BarackObama to exspensive for the middle class working people
@BarackObama And, I'm a 48year old travel nurse without any insurance because deductible rates range from $5000-$8000.
@BarackObama At what cost to other single insured?
@BarackObama 
Ít cute !!!>~<
@BarackObama I'm bothered most still call it Obama Care and not Affordable Care Act.As if our elected senate/house & lobbyists had no part.
@BarackObama thank you it has help our family tremendously
@BarackObama  gg
@BarackObama this mess was paid for by doubling or tripling the deductible of hard working Americans ...
@BarackObama Thank You President Obama..Bill and Hillary as well
@BarackObama people ages 26-65 are paying for it!
@BarackObama ... Very unamerican. Where has our freedom gone? I weep for my country.
@BarackObama you promised it and you did it
@BarackObama before #Obamacare  3000 a year after #Obamacare 8500 a year. Instead of Gov paying for uninsured we the people pay. #Thanks
@BarackObama Awesome!
@BarackObama   AT ENORMOUS ENORMOUS EXPENSE AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE DEDUCTIBLES
@BarackObama Obama has been turning America Up side down since he went into office Jan20,2009.He could even say the Oath right #BillOReilly
@BarackObama We celebrate true leadership in your empathy for American youth vis-a-vis the Obamacare
@BarackObama  #coffee #maker best sell ever I seen top10 coffee maker save 50% discount product http://goo.gl/A3tEWl 
@BarackObama - At what price??? I am out of work due to illnesses and cannot afford ins. yet you will take my tax return because of it. Scam
@BarackObama hi sir
@BarackObama I don't see how 300 a month and a deductible of $5000 is anything close to peace of mind. Good to know you use obamacare obama
@BarackObama But you are not giving peace and mind to the families with regular health insurance
@BarackObama because they are still on their parents plans!!!
@BarackObama it should be called "Obamadon'tcare"!!!
@BarackObama thank you so much
@BarackObama http://friendsclub.altervista.org/agree-agree-share-guideness/ …
@BarackObama not really working. People close to me have been declined, when they needed it the most....
@BarackObama after 8 years of no Heath coverage,  I now have insurance again thank you Mr Obama!!
@BarackObama That's cute... 'peace of mind'... Is that what you think fining people for not buying something they don't want gives them?
@BarackObama I pay 22$ a month for my insurance that covers the first $500, then I pay $1k, then am covered 90%.  Your insurance is EVIL
@BarackObama horrible.  The one person who I know that qualifies, refused it because his premium was $300 a month with high copays.
@BarackObama -BY WELFARE & FOOD STAMPS!!  Thought I'd finish your PROPAGANDA!!!
@BarackObama Mary Fallin was a fool for penalizing Oklahomans by refusing federal funding.  How does she get to speak for all of us here?
@BarackObama no I am sorry it is not.  Not enough money coming in to cover the cost.  Please tell us the truth.
@BarackObama obamacare: also charging people way more than they could afford for not having health insurance since 2010
@BarackObama thank you my man! God bless you, we are going to miss you next year Mr. President.
@BarackObama awesome,  the ones who need it least! I'm an obama supporter but your Healthcare plans STINKS!
@BarackObama Thank you so much for forcing people to buy a product they don't want, so that other people can have it without paying for it!
@BarackObama 
Yea, and if you like your Doctor you can keep him.
Lower cost by $2500.00 yr.?  For who??  YOU LIE!
@BarackObama gets reset in January. Lame duck
@BarackObama Now let's make ObamaCare affordable for the middle class. thx
@BarackObama Please let it be January 20, 2017!
@BarackObama Meanwhile, my wife's employer won't let her work enough hours for insurance to kick in, and the OCare deductible is $7,000+.
@BarackObama yes, but with a very high price increase that makes most of our high deductibles to high to manage.
@BarackObama oh shoot, I'm gonna lose it when I'm 26? Even if I'm a student?
@BarackObama  Yikes!
@BarackObama thank you Mr. President.
@BarackObama Correction-> Obamacare: Mandating young adults (and their parents) forfeit larger pieces of their pay since 2010. #fixedit
@BarackObama Hillary says we need insurance reform, thought that's what you did
@BarackObama except for me, I've been on the streets in san Diego drug free for 2 years. and I'm can't pass for sect. 8 or even cash aid.
@BarackObama 
It's a huge achievement. Greater Equality makes societies stronger, improving American's health and working capacity.
@BarackObama orrrr emptying my bank account but whatever you say boss
@BarackObama yeah everybody is paying for a Cadillac and getting a Prius
@BarackObama less than 5% of US population is a good start i guess
@BarackObama there are still methods within the southern governments that make it a most impossible to receive the coverage that is needed.
@BarackObama That is wonderful.  We still have a long way to go till  all Americans are covered.
@BarackObama Time to wake up boy. Obamacare is killing healthcare. IT DOESN'T WORK! STOP THE INJUSTICE OF IT!
@BarackObama You are living in denial in la-la land
@BarackObama.      Penalizing people who cant afford to buy medicare is like stealing their food money to feed their family. Think about it.
@BarackObama yes
@BarackObama explain this ...http://youtu.be/rhI6bMbhsDE 
@BarackObama 'Coverage' for all is good. But not enough. Cost of care/services still way too high. Fix that - problem solved.
@BarackObama the only thing that obamacare has done is given me a hard time with my  health insurance one more worry to the heap of the pile
@BarackObama # cannot pay the deductibles # only on paper
@BarackObama and millions more have lost their insurance and are seeing premiums double, and millions now can't afford insurance. ignorance.
@BarackObama, Wish if the whole world had President like him, world would become a better place
@BarackObama Dealing with that worthless Sh*thead's O-care crap since 2010!
@BarackObama That's a bunch of BS...
@BarackObama congratulations!!!!! Viviana
@BarackObama @0045Modou
@BarackObama my working 19-25 Y/Os because they have jobs, they can't afford your insurance. They would get more if they did less. So Wrong!
@BarackObama lol
@BarackObama your tweet is misleading - does not tell the real story
@BarackObama 61 people may be covered but after sky high deductibles they are still paying cash for the local Dr - how does that help?
@BarackObama yes but how many have actually paid
@BarackObama ...who didn't want coverage
@BarackObama failed
@BarackObama I am in my 30s and cannot afford it. As punishment for choosing to feed my family, i am forced to pay an extra tax. Thanks dick
@TSalommy @BarackObama Why should get a free ride ,the rest of us subsidize your family's health care?

@BarackObama "Giving" = "Forcing others to do as commanded by law or face penalties"?  Can I get a Liberal-English translator?
@barackobama 发中文啊，发中文啊，总统先生！！！
@barackobama  奥巴马总统，请以后发推附上中文翻译，谢谢！
@BarackObama Nothing is EVER perfect coming out of DC! Stop party lines & IMPROVE for "the people"! Don't cripple "the people"!
@BarackObama @claar_roy SMB also! Lifesaving measures vs pre-existing conditions! You choice?! Me?Nonnegotiable!
@BarackObama Funny we had 14 million uninsured when u started. Hm. Obama math
@BarackObama ha!!  As you tax them for not having insurance!
@BarackObama You've never had a relationship where someone needed the lifesaving measures it provided! I did!
@BarackObama more like fear of the IRS.  Obamacare is a joke.
@BarackObama well done mate. Great achievement
@BarackObama Starting to wish you could stay three terms in office. I don't like this year's candidates.
@BarackObama LOL! Where in the heck do they get this Bologna!? Does @POTUS actually believe #Obamacare is benefiting anyone? Doubt it.

@BarackObama I thought it was 26 yrs of age. My daughter's are attending Rutgers university in Camden NJ. Their GPA is 4.0 and they hv ADHD.
@BarackObama 6.1 million young adults are on mommy and daddy's plan until age 26. It's all about being fined shortly afterwards.
@BarackObama While the rest of us are threatened with a penalty if we choose to refuse insurance. #healthcarereformnotinsurancereform
@BarackObama Obamacare: bankrupting families and forcing them to change doctors they've had for 20 years since 2010. Quite a legacy.
@BarackObama Yeah, but they are not paying for it.
@BarackObama Rich people like yourself think the ACA is good & all are happy. Good intentions are ruining people's lives.
@BarackObama Except the poor from Florida. No coverage, no help.
@BarackObama Obamacare just cost me on my taxes $2,500. !
@BarackObama honestly im not with it Mr President. I can't afford it with the cost of living in San Diego and the minimum wage
