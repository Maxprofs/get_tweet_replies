@WhiteHouse @BarackObama WISE UP AMERICA THAT WAS A MESSAGES TO YOU ABOUT YOUR MONEYS PAY ATTENTIONS PLEASE,2008 caught us SleepingEYES OPEN
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Pass law to force news media to show TRUE STAISTICS ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES and not the ridiculous criticisms
@WhiteHouse without sharing Equal Voting Rights in US/UK democratic election,how can they help these terrorists in India,threatening us?
@WhiteHouse if US-UK like them, why don't they take these infiltrators to their own countries,as compare to destroy our homes in India?
@WhiteHouse i always favor to support Bangladesh in Bangladesh,and Pakistan in Pakistan,as compare to help these rogue nations in India
@WhiteHouse their survival only depends to the extent US/UK helping them on quake-Tsunami threats,hiding themselves from common public
@WhiteHouse these infiltrators might be hardly upto 50,000 on different government positions, as compare to 1.2 billion+ Indian people
@WhiteHouse this is Strength of a Civilian Vs Strength of False ID Bangladeshi+Pakistani infiltrators hiding themselves,and threatening
@WhiteHouse "his all friends were killed and Azmal Kasab caught,then hanged till death.just disclosure of their information is required"
@WhiteHouse "your fate is similar to Azmal Kasab, came here from Pakistan as 'Indian' Muzahidin, with Hindu type red stings on hands"
@WhiteHouse its my message for these infiltrators from my home.a bottom line difference between me and them,only thing behind all drama
@WhiteHouse  and this is outcome when the so called God of world, only lie/cheat/organized bluffs... all wrong is justified on gun point
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and then wrong information to common people about me,hardly a civilian?what the US president doesn't know about me?
@WhiteHouse here, how does this make the US proud, almost a God of world? how helping these things in India or any other country right?
@WhiteHouse Earth quake-Tsunami threats is always put on the common Indian civilians to keep helping these infiltrators survived somehow
@WhiteHouse and then false ID people of Bangladesh+Pakistan are put on high positions in India, who want to attack on me,and CIA quiet?
@WhiteHouse many from US/UK helped me survived, a civilian, but always a wrong information was delivered about me, to keep me like this
@WhiteHouse and my main problem is because of US's president, who come here but doesn't disclose things going on with me.a shameful act
@WhiteHouse those who are hiding themselves, have limited life, based on hiding themselves, "only", and i walk on road as a civilian
@WhiteHouse false ID infiltrators of Bangladesh and Pakistan only have pig-dog deaths overnight,if they dont surrender,news of tomorrow
@WhiteHouse when i come out of my home, false ID people threaten me. can they guarantee their survival once they disclose themselves?
@WhiteHouse Im a civilian, living in the flat my father gifted me in Lucknow,my Indian passport was issued from this address itself in 2003
@WhiteHouse many look like film stars,many in politics of India,and hiding themselves after an Indian Identity,false Hindu names,mainly
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama i mean, before threatening me,first introduce yourself, if you have strength to do so, with a civilian like me
@WhiteHouse can they threaten me after by disclosing their Identity? all hiding themselves on Indian-Hindu names, false ID people, mainly
@WhiteHouse sir, today i was thinking,"those from Pakistan-Bangladesh, who always threaten me in India for a long,as i don't favor them
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Sir, This is what every citizen of any country dreams of,

@WhiteHouse  petty america I fought for my country and went to foreign lands but we never get a break. Wake up
@WhiteHouse loss and everyone hates the black man.

@WhiteHouse s/b " after a lifetime of hard work, good decisions, and investing wisely - you should be able to retire with dignity.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that would be fantastic especially if the fed govt was not making it impossible
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hard work? You mean giving almost all of your earnings back to the government ? That's slavery.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama tell that to the vile people who run the UK Mr President.
@WhiteHouse well hard work plus cancer equals no savings at all. Wish radiation didn't cost $9,000 bucks.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Oh yeah does that mean you're going to keep cheatng on Wall Street & not let it crash like the last two Presidents.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama the problem is, what is the definition of "hard work".
@WhiteHouse - Then why did the government bail out wall street instead of jailing them?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama A man of wise words.
@WhiteHouse Not with you at the helm. Can not trust anything you do or say. We are no longer a leader in the world and we will pay for it.
