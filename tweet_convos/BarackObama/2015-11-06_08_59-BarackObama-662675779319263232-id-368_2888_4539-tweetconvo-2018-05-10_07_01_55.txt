@BarackObama Another attack on middle class jobs! #WakeUpAmerica
@swhiscpa @BarackObama 
Yeah, all 12 of them just so Canada can sell oil to China....
@frankonfranky @BarackObama clearly you don't understand economics or the impact of job creation.
@swhiscpa @BarackObama 
A REAL jobs plan would involve getting ppl working on OUR infrastructure,something GOP ignored for over a decade now
@frankonfranky @swhiscpa @BarackObama what's the point of creating jobs at the expense of the environment?
@black_rhino @frankonfranky @BarackObama Not what the studies show.  One could argue that most jobs are at the expense of the environment.
@markinzeroland: @BarackObama -- Limiting our energy resources does not limit our energy needs.
@markinzeroland @BarackObama do u know resources r depleting & alt energy is increasing, even if pipeline is built it wont be as idealised
@NovEmma -- What? Canada couldn't use the profits to expands its alternate energy development? That's shortsighted itself. ~ @BarackObama
@markinzeroland @BarackObama there are many other ways to do that with less financial risk / environmental risk.
@NovEmma -- Such as? Can they be used to offset oil imports from unstable regions too? ~ @BarackObama
@BarackObama you sir are an idiot! The pipeline would create thousands of jobs, get us closer to energy independence. You hate America.
@HMartin1985 We've moved closer to energy independence under @BarackObama due to more domestic oil & gas production,supporting #CleanEnergy.
@PoliticalAnt @BarackObama negative we are more dependant on foreign imports under Obama than any other president in history....
@ceciliatan @BarackObama not good a lot of people just lost jobs.
@duckee70 @BarackObama I'd rather not lose the environment.
@ceciliatan @BarackObama I live in part of the pipeline. All its done is bring us jobs.
@duckee70 there are too many things wrong with the pipeline plan, too many risks were glossed over.
@ceciliatan it explains all our earthquakes in OK.
@duckee70 yeah, scary: friends in the oil business moved out of Texas when earthquakes started happening -- from fracking, they said.
@ceciliatan I have a friend That's a geologist. He's tried to explain it to me many times. We have fault lines...
@BarackObama ZsaZsa
@BarackObama the USA has built 10,000 miles of pipelines while delaying #KeystoneXL
@BarackObama the president is doing a great job
@BarackObama That's the way it should be
@BarackObama fix the health care 9.5% of my income is outrages do 1 correct
@BarackObama You still need oil delivery and pipelines are safer then rail.
3 in 8 months?
@BarackObama حتى اوباما يعرف يتكلم إنجليزي هههههه
@BarackObama #KeystoneXL #climatechange  FUN STUFF! Watch what #groupthink leads 2 from Pres (!!) of Sierra Club : https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=Sl9-tY1oZNw …
@BarackObama You said the pipeline was not a climate change disaster waiting to happen so why use it as a "huge step" proclamation?
@BarackObama It was murder
@BarackObama the oil will be moved by other means, I'm guessing there are two 1) by semi truck over the road 2) trains powered both desiel
@BarackObama now I know why obamas head is up his a.. I finally watched the "kings man".
@BarackObama "From all of us here at the White House..."
@BarackObama thank you Mr President for making something I protested for happen!
@bonomoam @BarackObama
@stanward1093 @BarackObama #cleanenergynow
@BarackObama @mnaqiu7654 #KTO3.0
@BarackObama. So glad you voted against. The pipeline.  Mother earth thanks you
@BarackObama this is why I moved out of my own country. Saying no to 100 thousands of jobs like the keystone Now we wait for four more years
@BarackObama

Excellent news: @BarackObama just took another huge step to #ActOnClimate by rejecting the #KeystoneXL pipeline @NoFrackingMx @NoFrackingNL

Oh, FYI Obama: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10153276320022076&substory_index=0&id=268108602075 …
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama Who would ever imagine that Obama would become one of the best President all times for this great nation. Imagine a Republican
@raybae689
@BarackObama I appreciate this
@BarackObama create thousands of jobs with the #KeystoneXL pipeline! Loads of BS from our president!
@BarackObama  I know how laal bhadur shatri died
@BarackObama #BarackObama is #chickenlittle hard headed bully too pig headed do the right thing meanwhile thousands are murdered in #Chirac
@BarackObama fighting climate change happens one decision at a time. Bravo.
@BarackObama @WarrenBuffett did #Keystone just get 'railroaded'? Isn't railroaded oil 'dirty' too or does it depends who benefits? 
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @paladinette It's about time! Thank you to all the #NoKXL activists and protestors for fighting the good fight! Cheers to you!
@BarackObama clearly it isn't good for Obama & company if it HELPS AMERICA and AMERICAN workers.......SO SAD!!!!
@BarackObama wants us to be funding Arab terrorists by buying their oil. Carter Clinton and Obama fumble alternative energy ball. $$$$
@BarackObama PERHAPS YOU HAVEN`T  SEEN NASA`S REPORT OR CHOOSE TO IGNORE...https://www.therealstrategy.com/nasa-debunked-global-warming-hoax-in-study/ …
@BarackObama thank you for taking this step
@BarackObama I don't mind you pulling the plug on a project, but please have a plan B ready to go???
@BarackObama really how is stopping climate changes from happening by rejecting the #KeystoneXL #keystonepipeline hahaha that is to funny ha
@BarackObama The Earth thanks you, sir. #KeystoneXL
@BarackObama Please BO! Hope you GOOD!  Keep your smile!
@BarackObama Hey BO! All we need is Jesus to come SAVE the world!  Let OUR FATHER be sang in the mountain!
@BarackObama President Obama is awesome
@BarackObama :Mr.Barack i personally think that you are a very good presidente.
@BarackObama meilleur président du monde entiers,un exemple suivre.
@BarackObama A letter should have been written for a great president from the beginning. Because you think certainly.
@BarackObama Thank you for rejecting the Keystone Pipeline!!!!
@BarackObama you have done a great job your nearly 7 years in office!
@BarackObama thank you President Obama. Your daughters must be proud
@BarackObama thank you for rejecting #KeystoneXL!!
You @BarackObama are quite the politician, I admit. Oil production elsewhere, like Mid East & Argentina, ADDS to pollution. #EPA not there
@BarackObama http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/america-has-built-the-equivalent-of-10-keystone-pipelines-since-2010-and-no-one-said-anything …
Huge step to #actonclimate ???
@BarackObama thank you Mr. President
@BarackObama thank you for blocking the Keystone XL!
@BarackObama :The destruction of land, pollution potential wasn't worth a few jobs and bucks.
@BarackObama THANK YOU,  and thanks in advance from your grandchildrens grandchildren. #letsnotpoisonearth #PopeFrancis truth has been heard
@BarackObama Thank you! This wouldn't be good for Canada either. (We have a new PM. You two are going to get along just fine!)
@Alli7on @BarackObama if you have an alternative to oil bring it to the table put up or shut up stop driving wearing polyester & eat grass
@BarackObama why did u wait 2 days after the swearing in of new PM ?
U had 7 yrs
@BarackObama How does moving oil  by a sealed pipeline cause any climate change?
@BarackObama thank you President Obama!!
@BarackObama I support you.
@BarackObama Thank you Mr. President. My understanding as far as the jobs are concerned, is that they are only temporary anyway.
@BarackObama This took so long because you were studying it? Ha! Inevitable political decision made for reasons outside statutory authority.
.@BarackObama Big win for head chopping Saudi oil Shieks and ISIS terrorists, unemployed Canadian and American workers SOL
.@BarackObama  Zero net gain #ActOnClimate, the US will use the exact same amount of oil, now more funds for terrorists via Saudi Arabia
Translation:  @BarackObama just protected his buddies who transport oil ia rail.  @RBeisert
In other words Warren Buffett @idaho_expatriot @BarackObama @RBeisert
Ayup.  And we all know it.  @steveatmguy @BarackObama @RBeisert
@BarackObama You are a moron for rejecting #KeystoneXL #SHAMEonYOU

@BarackObama worst president in the history of the US. #KeystoneXL #bringontherepublicans
@dthomas1976 @BarackObama Thank God I've lived long enough that losing Iran doesn't matter anymore, to Americans. Regards, Jimmy Carter.
@BarackObama Thank you.  Can you also assist Iowa to stop the Bakken pipeline?  Our governor has chosen to not represent us.  #nobakken
@BarackObama huge step against America.
@BarackObama Does Warren Buffet tuck you k to bed at night?
@BarackObama So continuing to enable the terrorists you have allowed to flourish in the Middle East ... Is what... A better idea?
@BarackObama Thank You Mr. President!
@BarackObama: Obama just took another huge step to #ActOnClimate by rejecting the #KeystoneXL pipeline. George Soros should be so proud!
@BarackObama How is it an #ActOnClimate change?? We are STILL importing from across the world using fossil fuel powered means!
@BarackObama Politics Over People (Jobs). Climate Over Common Sense. #keystonepipeline Another Obama Fail.
Can I just sum up No #KeystoneXL with a yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! @BarackObama

@BarackObama thumbs up for the president!
@BarackObama how was this going to affect the climate how and when?
@BarackObama Thank YOUuuuuuuu...!
@BarackObama nice
@BarackObama thank you for representing this generation and future generations.
GREAT JOB, @BARACKOBAMA & @POTUS!!! :D
@BarackObama @ctconline getting a Democrat elected is more important to you than American jobs. USA becoming more isolated every day.
We are born into a climate. It changes. Earth will survive every citizen @BarackObama?
@BarackObama Based on the average girth of your populous have you gone for the XXXXL pipeline instead?
@BarackObama what an idiot
@BarackObama another mark for a lobbyist!! Another idiotic move for the greatest sin known to man=money. Smh I'm DONE being dissapointed!!
@BarackObama nope, we all need oil. Stopping a pipeline doesn't change that fact whatsoever. Rather your oil from Middle East or Venezuela?
@BarackObama Обама навел бардак как у себя в стране, так и на Ближнем Востоке, а еще на Украине. Беженцы в ЕС это на его совести. Нет совест
@BarackObama Thank you.
@BarackObama Don't understand everything that you've done, but your on it! I support it. Lead.
@BarackObama so freaking naive to think that the oil I Canada won't be used. And shipped to China
@BarackObama we had great respect for u but ur pak policy will prove the dangerous and costilest expenditure a waste

@BarackObama Thank you. Qe'ci yew'yew' (Thank you)
@BarackObama How is breaking?  Keystone asked for plan to be rejected so can revise plans in Nebraska?  Nugget will get pipeline.
@BarackObama one man has done more damage to this world than all global warming since the beginning of time !!!!
@BarackObama YAS you are the best
@BarackObama - My kind of POTUS!
@BarackObama Doofus in Chief
@BarackObama another huge step in JOB KILLING work for already broken jobless middle-class America. How much money did Warren Buffet give ya

@BarackObama when a smarter person starts running the company the pipeline will go through
@BarackObama thank you mr. President!!
@BarackObama Thank you for your courage and leadership, Mr. President. We are so lucky to have you in office at this critical time.
@BarackObama  YES! STICK TO IT! Don't let these companies run right over you. They only want the profits.
@BarackObama All you did was delay the process by about a year. You're never going to stop this industry.
@BarackObama   Goody goody! Can he get another term??  NOT!
@BarackObama Bogus reasons exposed by Treasonous GOP.  Tell them to pay back their graft.

@BarackObama thank you for making the right decision! #KeystoneXL
@BarackObama THANK YOU!!!
@BarackObama Just one more GIANT step backwards. We need to be closer to self sufficient not further away.
@BarackObama a very good decision
@BarackObama Did U #ActOnClimate when U LIED 2 #USA about a idiot #Video for slaughtered #Americans in #Benghazi like #HillaryClinton? #tcot
@BarackObama

@BarackObama 
@BarackObama THANK YOU, PBO! My arrest in front of the White House 9/3/11 and encircling the WH on 11/6/11 were NOT in vain!
@BarackObama Don't you mean you acted to support the railroad that moves the oil today instead of using more efficient pipeline? #KeystoneXL
@BarackObama congrats on taking this bold step of leadership
@BarackObama Anti domestic jobs. Pro foreign oil dependence. #AmericaLoses
@BarackObama Still not enough to combat all the hot air you blow from your narcissistic feeble minded brain every day
@BarackObama thank you for your decision on the keystone pipeline!
@BarackObama Thank you President Obama for saving our environment and people's health!
@BarackObama Can someone explain to me if the oil still comes in via rail (which it will and has been) how this saves our climate?
@BarackObama But President Obama....are we going to dig up existing pipelines....we have to...it's unsafe!
@BarackObama I thought you said it was because it did not increase our energy security? Now you admit to pandering to the climate alarmists.
@BarackObama a huge step backwards for the independence of America
@BarackObama Massive failure as president
@BarackObama Jackass
@BarackObama another American president protecting Saudi oil interests.
@BarackObama Just one more reason to love you! Thank you, from me,  my kids, and planet Earth!
@tneverready @BarackObama can confirm, am @tneverready's kid, thank you :)
@BarackObama you’re gonna regret this, bub.
