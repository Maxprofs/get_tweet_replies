@BarackObama @TheeRobMac Sounds great but will break the bank that is the middle class that has to pay for it, not him or government.
@MTpointguard Nah. We pay for it with our premium. Now what we was paying for in the past was the uninsured going into emergency room.
@TheeRobMac ACA should have been thrown out from the start for including escalating tax/fine for choosing not to enroll. #SCOTUSfail.
@MTpointguard so I can pick up the tab for not having insurance when they walk in emergency room?  Nah son! No thank you. Get insured
@TheeRobMac Im insured with high deductible HSA. Good thing about it is that I only pay for what I use, when I use it. Low monthly premium
@MTpointguard @mdcolliM @TheeRobMac I went the same route. Works better than an 80/20 plan for us.
@BarackObama @POTUS Agreed / #Lyme pts suffer OOP expenses, misdx, poor tests/treatment guidelines. We need help.
@lymestats @BarackObama @POTUS #AskPOTUS
@ksqrrl_karen @lymestats @BarackObama @POTUS  u
@BarackObama That's great. Maintain it & spread that message to African leaders.
@BarackObama ...here in India we cannot even dream about it....
@BarackObama @iesavage For the moment. The right to pay a tax to a private corp, is not a right. I can't buy food AND health ins.
@DavidWLocke Not buying it.  My Daughter was able in a very red state to secure HC reasonably. @BarackObama @iesavage
@mdcolliM @BarackObama @iesavage I'm not selling anything. I'm telling you my situation. I can't pay the insurance and the co-pay.
@BarackObama great
@BarackObama @tkdmike I live in one of the most brokeass states around & I've never heard of a legit problem with ACA. #luckynewmexicans
@BarackObama @ComedienneMsPat then why dont you do that instead of tripling my healthcare costs so i can pay for people that dont #think
@Scared_2_Fart #Troll @BarackObama @ComedienneMsPat
@BarackObama @DaHomieK single payer now!!'
@BarackObama follow me mr.president please,

@BarackObama Yes. But we should let the "all" decide, not you!
Dear @barackobama India : Healthcare is Privilege of Rich. @vsikka @ckforcleanindia @ap @unesco
Justice is Privilege of Rich & Influential Indians under @narendramodi. @barackobama @rntata2000 @undpgeneva
@BarackObama are you gay tn.obama?
@BarackObama great!
@BarackObama @tkdmike I thought republicans were pro subsidies.
@BarackObama precisely what the British Government is take away from us #march4nhs
@BarackObama #educate #america #reschedule #MedicalMarijuana #medicalcannabis paralyzed people should not live with ungodly muscle spasms
@BarackObama One should look out for an added amount of hypocondrics with a public heathcare
@BarackObama Mando bem

@BarackObama I am a big fan of you and I hope that we will one day meet and we will be great friends. Please follow me back. I love you! Bye
@BarackObama Can I have the same plan as you or congress?
@BarackObama the insurance companies will have a war for customers to continuously win like cell phone company's now !
@BarackObama privatizing healthcare with regulations Is inevitable let State Farm ,Gieco ect. Battle for customers
@BarackObama @hardiedavis healthcare is not a right. Never has been, never will
@BarackObama health care is not a God given right nor a right for all Americans to be enforced with penalty and fines smh
@BarackObama but It is hard to do than speak.
@BarackObama dam right Mr. PRESIDENT!! AMEN
@nelaknight Because @mcconnellpress on election night "09 #1 goal to make PBO one term Pres. #Racism
@BarackObama you are right.  Healthcare is a right.  But why so expensive?
@BarackObama hahaha
@BarackObama Amen.
@BarackObama too bad so many other countries did this before us haha. Can't really say America is unique in this regard
@BarackObama ok thank you
@BarackObama you are so smart, the greatest President ever
@BarackObama Congratulations Mr. President!
@BarackObama 

Like us then. 
@BarackObama But rest  of the  world  what  will  be?
@BarackObama @FOX5Vegas They don't tell the whole story. I would have had to pay 350 a month with a 6000 deductible such who can afford that
@BarackObama yes care must be for everybody not for online the rich people
@BarackObama @jptrib1 Agreed, the right to healthcare has been established. The fight for its provision continues. #singlepayer
@BarackObama how is it a right for all when there's a price on it ?  Not everyone can afford healthcare
@BarackObama One has no right to the goods and services others provide.
@BarackObama "You Go boy!!!!"
@BarackObama If only that were true. I can't afford healthcare, and I REALLY can't afford insurance. #SCOTUScare #Obamacare #Fail
@BarackObama you got that right, thanks Mr. President!
@BarackObama ALLAmerican?or ALL people in the  USA
@BarackObama Like going out to dinner & finding out you are the one paying for the steak & lobsters for all!  POTUS.you are bankrupting us
So Arizona isnt part of this America he speaks of. 
@BarackObama @KTAR923
@BarackObama I strongly disagree. I do not feel privileged to pay for my own healthcare. Don't screw this up like the gov messed up SS money
@BarackObama finally in USA, too
@BarackObama keep going!!!
@BarackObama  Please help Nepal for health.
“@BarackObama: "In America, health care is not a privilege for the few but a right for all." —President Obama”
@BarackObama @iesavage I'm sure I have the right to pay for "nothing."
@BarackObama @iesavage I'm sure that once funeral industry pays enough bribes, it'll be a right as well. What corp wouldn't want subsidy.
@BarackObama @iesavage Worse, I can't pay the Co-pay AND the insurance bill. I used to get care. Now, I do not.
@BarackObama thats crap, my son in PA has been denied, affordable care act, he is disabled, liar!
@BarackObama Job well done!!!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Thank You @POTUS
“@BarackObama: "In America, health care is not a privilege for the few but a right for all." —President Obama” but in Indonesia, .... ???
@BarackObama eh not really
@BarackObama its not a right. You should know as an educated lawyer. Please stop making things up...
@BarackObama but I still can't afford it...
@BarackObama  thank u soo much Mr President!
@BarackObama Universal healthcare for all is his ultimate goal, putting private insurance companies out of business.
@BarackObama hi sir
@BarackObama I agree...in Indonesia too
@BarackObama
@BarackObama unbelievable for USA to be in this position. Healthcare should be a constitutional right more important than bearing arms.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama you did great Mr Obama. Here in Nigeria people die for little sickness due to high medical bills.
@BarackObama health care has always been a right. Just hasn't been affordable for all. For some it now costs more.
@BarackObama maybe not healthcare, but health services still dont work
@BarackObama accept jesus
“@BarackObama: "In America, health care is not a privilege for the few but a right for all." —President Obama”
@BarackObama Absolutely, with no doubt!!!
@BarackObama @FOX5Vegas except it hasn't covered all, now has it?
@BarackObama 
"You're in my house"
Mr president ,
You make us
Laughing & farting
@BarackObama bc you socialized my healthcare system...
@BarackObama As long as other people will work to provide it for them _ someone has to pay
@BarackObama you have created Tyranny.  That's your legacy, the transformation of life liberty p.o.h. to 3 tyrannical branches of govt.
@BarackObama 
That's how it is supposed to be! Bravo!!
@BarackObama Sir imagine how ghos will happen when u r not able to implement it in 8 yrs that too in power...
@BarackObama that would be true, if we had nationalized healthcare. Which we don't.
@_whits_  you have no idea what you are talking about, i would do more research into the pros and cons before making a stupid decision
@BarackObama Quality healthcare with value to our patients is the objective. Access to care is just the first critical step.
@BarackObama @POTUS #Lyme patients need your help. https://www.change.org/p/barack-obama-legalize-lyme-disease … @IDSAInfo @CDCgov
@BarackObama indeed it is...people should use this as an opportunity to lead a quality life: physical as well  as mental n spiritual health!
@BarackObama Thanks thanks thanks.
@BarackObama you said it well MR PRESIDENT thank you from a guy that could not get insurance before. Could not afford an had preexisting
@BarackObama Then I better get a refund on all my premiums. Free speech is a right, but we don't charge premiums for that...
@BarackObama @gabino_58 does that mean there's plans to expand ACA coverage to ensure ALL Americans can access their right to #Healthcare?
@BarackObama. Obamacare has helped those w/had no hope or help. Its a good thing
@BarackObama follow me plese
@BarackObama what about the HUGE PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES????
@BarackObama those governing who have an issue with all of us having healthcare should fix what they don't like, ty for some help!
@BarackObama We would be a communist nation if you had your total way.
@BarackObama that's how it's meant to be for every citizen of any country.
@BarackObama @POTUS thousands #Lyme pts suffer yrs b4 diagnosis, treatment >= lifesavings https://www.change.org/p/barack-obama-legalize-lyme-disease …
@BarackObama A right to healthcare yes, but not a right to get it free.
@BarackObama then socialize it.
@BarackObama. Halo Mr PRESIDEN How are you to day, I'm from Indonesia,
@BarackObama No crap, Sherlock. Health care is also the responsibility of the person, quit poisoning your body and expecting us to fix it.
@BarackObama @ComedienneMsPat so long as corporations make a large profit off of it.
@BarackObama in törkey, fitil is the ultimate solution for your eni problem
ACA is not universal HC RT“@BarackObama: "In America, health care is not a privilege for the few but a right for all." —President Obama”
RT @BarackObama "In America, health care is not a privilege for the few but a right for all." —President Obama
@BarackObama In the UK with have the national health service and it is the difference between life and death when you can't afford treatment
@BarackObama except for those who work hard. You price is out of the market
@BarackObama The same in Africa,
@BarackObama If healthcare is a right for all than it should be free like in Canada or the UK. Just sayin
#itsnotlikemyopinionmattersanyways
@BarackObama @POTUS the @IDSAInfo needs a re-org to write correct #Lyme guidelines https://www.change.org/p/barack-obama-legalize-lyme-disease … Pls help.
@BarackObama Wow wish my country South Africa could hv the same mentallity Thank you Mr President
@BarackObama in Uganda.....still a mystery......
@BarackObama #SinglePayer only answer
@BarackObama the Us is a shithole Mr president I wanna move 
@BarackObama #thisishealthcare
@BarackObama very sweet GodBlessU Mr.President
@BarackObama So, health care is not money care. It sounds really, ideally America Dream. (^_^)
@BarackObama: "In America, health care is not a privilege for the few but a right for all." —President Obama
@BarackObama Rights are free, why can't Health Care be free if its a right?
@BarackObama kinda funny when you indirectly caused wars in Syria...don't their people need healthcare too?
@BarackObama  right Mr. President.
@BarackObama can you point to me where our founding fathers said health care is a right...i can't seem to find it anywhere
@barackobama asi se habla en SOCIALISMO presidente. eso es HUMANISMO la misma doctrina de CRISTO. felicitaciones!!!
@BarackObama it not a right... a law mayb but not a right.
@BarackObama sorry,but I'm still wondering why it's called the affordable care act? My premiums, co pays and ded are higher than before
@BarackObama As growing up in Unitedstate's Of America from going to public school to applying for job Medical Insurance is always the main!
@BarackObama thank you Mr President
@BarackObama @POTUS Indeed - but it is not a right for patients with #LymeDisease? We need help urgently.
@BarackObama kkkk yo kidding
@BarackObama so ussesso
@BarackObama Youbama
@barackobama that is something marvelous. I wish to see it in Tanzania.
.@BarackObama Doctors who quit their jobs violate human rights then.
@BarackObama thank you, Mr. President. I'm a widowed mom and am thankful for ObamaCare!
@BarackObama @JarredTLong
@cjmccleary26 @BarackObama I think the same but the ACA isn't the way to go
@JarredTLong @BarackObama well it's here to stay so get used to it
@cjmccleary26 @BarackObama a repub gets elected in 2016 it's gonna be gone. Which isn't necessarily good cuz they don't have a replacement
@JarredTLong it won't be gone if they don't have a replacement
@cjmccleary26 not if it's Ted Cruz. He has no worries
@JarredTLong haha your right about that I'm glad it's most likely jeb vs Hilary
@cjmccleary26 if it is I'm not gonna vote
@BarackObama are you sure?
@BarackObama USA is not America. USA is a country, America a continent.
@BarackObama can we make working a right and a duty as well and take some of this pressure off the middle class.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama о свободной продаже оружия? Сколько должно еще погибнуть американцев, чтобы конгресс сможет принять нужное решение?

@BarackObama great concept! im assuming all your haters will skip out on those services?
@BarackObama Indeed for the entire world healthcare aught to be quite subsidised if not free. Affirmative action is indeed a good calling...

@barackobama one baby step closer to single payer, then you'll join the rest of us in the developed world.
@BarackObama Not when the few that actually pay for it pays for those who can work but the system lets them choose not to.  $14K a yr for us
