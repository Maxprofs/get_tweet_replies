@Slate and guess what traitor in chief? Everybody is sick of you, your lies, your pandering and your weakness.

@Slate Let's get Hillary Clinton in the White house the only thing Trump can do is lie and let are great nation be destroyed
its a great idea in theory but this will not work to application. what do you think employers are going to do?
employers will be forced to really penalize big time for using over the given 7 day sick leave.
in essence any days missed over 7, you could jeopardize your job. action, reaction.  leave it alone Obama.
