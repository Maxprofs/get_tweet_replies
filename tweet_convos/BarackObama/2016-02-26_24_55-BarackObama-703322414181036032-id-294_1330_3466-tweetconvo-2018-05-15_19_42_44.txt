@BarackObama vous éte celui dont Martin Luther king a vu en rêve merci
@BarackObama A long way in shredding millions more jobs.
@BarackObama Numbers are way off.  800,000 a day x 365 days a year = 292 million.  That's more than the working population.  Maybe 8,000?
.@BarackObama really, "a day?" Check yo math
.@BarackObama That means the entire country would be unemployed in 1.1 years (assuming linear rate which of course isn't right)
@BarackObama can you please arrest #DonaldTrump as I think he is probably going to set the US back 500 yrs if elected
@BarackObama 800,000 jobs a day? Did @realDonaldTrump write that post for you?
@BarackObama Typical republicans dispute your numbers and say it wasn't that bad; so what do you say to the inbred republicans?
@BarackObama what are you doing about the 42mil people without Heath care living in USA?
@BarackObama Umm,  do you mean 800,000 jobs a year?

@BarackObama  the longest growth in history.without help from the Republicans.
@BarackObama 800,000 job losses a day? At that rate the whole workforce would have been gone in a year.
@BarackObama Execuse me Sir,how to learn America for the world through your lens .Sincerely yours ,Sirs .
I think the White House Twitter typist was excited - that's 800,000 per month in Nov 2008, not per day. @BarackObama
@BarackObama Quite an accomplishment one of many from you Mr. President.
@BarackObama Right on. Start flooding Twitter with your accomplishments to offset the BS being spewed by GOP candidates.
@BarackObama thanks Obama. No really!
@BarackObama Well done!! You're too young to retire. We hope to see you in other leadership roles on the world's stage next year
@BarackObama yea but now most of them gave up 93 million without jobs
@BarackObama i know u think theres plenty of stupid people who would believe that and unfortunately its idiots  one thing you did get right
@BarackObama Thank you Mr.President a job well done you did the best you could while in office.
