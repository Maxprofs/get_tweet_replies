@BarackObama People stupid enough to have kids when they make min wage deserve to be poor. That’s their choice.
@RedGalBlueState @BarackObama do you not understand that things happen that we cannot control? If they had the choice to take on a job w/ hi
@Steffany_Kim @RedGalBlueState @BarackObama anyone who says someone deserves to be poor deserves to be ignored
@_WonderRoy @RedGalBlueState @BarackObama what even is humanity if we think this ignorantly
@Steffany_Kim Wait, I thought the ACA covered all birth control. Minimum wagers should try using it. @_WonderRoy @BarackObama
@RedGalBlueState I thought the government paid for primary education also maybe u should try that too
@Steffany_Kim Thanks for the offer, but I already have a master’s degree that my parents sacrificed mightily to pay for in full.
@RedGalBlueState You are literally saying just bc a family's life isn't privileged as yours then they deserve to be poor. What education did
@BarackObama If you think fast food workers should get $15/hr, open a taco stand and pay them $15/hr. Go try it. @donnabrazile

@dina51814 @BarackObama it's not about my success it's about corporate business
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage, #RaiseThePovertyLevel. Go ahead and destroy business. You will be the one who pays for it in the end.
@BarackObama @JosephBrandon8  We could put 300 Million on here and Boehner and McConnell wouldn't give it a nod ! There only for the Rich !
@BarackObama but Sir, raising the wage will raise the price of everything, couldn't we just go down on prices & salaries & government money?
@BarackObama god put you in that position to help all people..when they say no to everything..they said no to god and we know what happen

@BarackObama @beagrant those jobs are not for raising a family dip
@BarackObama this for the millionaires and billionaires. ..I want to feel your pain in paying more taxes..I want to feel that pain
@BarackObama One should think of this before having a family, its irresponsible to have kids you know you cannot support.
@BarackObama @now7grandkids Tell this to President @EPN @BarackObama please
@BarackObama.. your a billionaire ..pick one..pay higher wages or pay more taxes...
@BarackObama Yeah min wage needs to go up nation wide how do they expect ppl to survive on 9 bucks an hr in NY state?

@BarackObama Min wage jobs are all that's available in my area and the factories only pay ten an hr

@BarackObama @davonmagwood that's not the point, you have to earn it, shouldn't be handed to you.  Responsibility is key

@BarackObama @donnabrazile minimum wage was never intended to be a wage that supports a family...it was intended to entry level
@BarackObama And then you introduced.... #BasicIncome ......
@BarackObama @Chrissy_NC  I envy you guys in America.

@BarackObama when you have a shit head as president
@BarackObama or go to college, get a degree, find a real job and support your family. But you made it to easy to leach off of the system
@BarackObama well dumbass, thats because no one should be working at McDonalds trying to raise a family. Don't have them if you can't afford
@BarackObama -Saeed Abedini's wife and children desperately want their dad to be released from prison in Iran. Will you stand up for them?
Shade! RT @BarackObama "If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it." #SOTU
@BarackObama but that is not the point of a $15,000/yr job.. it is a starter, a 2ndary, a spouse or partner's supplement. Wrong on this, sir
@BarackObama or maybe just get an education and a decent job instead of trying to support your family as a fast food worker

@BarackObama Thank you! A lot of us do live on this a year. This made my day Mr. President.
@BarackObama minimum wage jobs aren't meant to raise a family...for the thousandth time.
@BarackObama @gregrikaart at this point why does Boehner look like he is either withdrawling or getting an enema?  #layofftheboozeBoehner
@BarackObama preach.
@BarackObama @skinsballr I can barely support myself on 15K a year and that's with some help.
@CoutureWriter i totally agree w/ you there, Cecily #RaiseTheWage #SOTU
@BarackObama this would solve nothing as it would decrease the value of the dollar, and cause prices to rise. Therefore we would be the same
@BarackObama I make that a yr doing nails :(
@BarackObama    Maybe 50 yrs ago a family could survive on that small amount, but after the year 1980... No Way!
@BarackObama shame of middle and lower class republicans they are still supporting the republican  of their cynicism.
@BarackObama did you just hit the most sensitive of republican congress? They will never do a work or make less what they're doing.
@BarackObama one of the BEST lines!! #shutitdown

Wow..what a concept! MT @Randall_Seth: @BarackObama I don't have to cuz I plan on graduating high school #SOTU
@BarackObama I work full time at my own business and have a hard time raising a family on 60K a year. No one working deserves 15K, obscene.
@BarackObama I would love to see how many republicans are to going to respond to this one.
@BarackObama @RowenaMonde Question is: how to create more wealth...US produces only 75% of what it consumes. Rest is credit. Will crash soon
@SamDMule The worst thing is GOP solution is to change policies, not raise minimum wage or pay people more...
@BarackObama @100Concerned which one will take the challenge?
@BarackObama  costs will rise more than revenues and Businesses may lay off workers. help CREATE jobs so there is more demand for employment
@BarackObama if you raise the wage, companies raise prices to cover the labor costs. Cost of living goes up, nothing changes. #OpenYourEyes
@BarackObama @susanbrandon96 2 mimic Ed McMahon on the Tonight Show "U R correct sir"
@BarackObama you aren't supposed to live off of min. wage. That's why people get educated.
@BarackObama or simply don't gave kids if you can't support them! Wow! I came up with a solution all on my own!
@BarackObama the sad thing is that there are people who unfortunately have to face this struggle
@BarackObama lower your crazy payroll taxes and a small business owner could afford to pay their employees more. #obamacare
@BarackObama thankfully this statement doesn't apply to New Jersey
@BarackObama ¿Será que el Congreso mexicano sí cree que una familia mexicana puede vivir con $5 dls. al día?
@BarackObama then don't have minimum skills
@BarackObama FUCK IT UP BARACK OH SHJT
@BarackObama YES FATHER
@BarackObama I don't have to I worked hard to not suffer like that; if you want it enough you'll go and get it!! isn't that what u did???
@BarackObama You realize other costs increase with the wage increase, right?

@BarackObama @JordanGoins ur wage is based on demand, skill & responsibility not because you want it to.
#AmericaTheBratty
@BarackObama then why is that guy getting paid minimum wage in the first place? It's that guy doing something wrong, not the government/ppl
@BarackObama if you raise minimum wage will you then cap profit margins to minimize price hikes that will destroy entire sectors of commerce
@BarackObama."well said Mr president.
@BarackObama @stiffy_staffy "why try harder when you can live off the system?" -President Obama
@FATMANski lol you're a fool if you think republicans are passing policies that benefit you (the middle class)
@stiffy_staffy they are in Michigan. Raising the minimum wage damages everyone. If you work at McDonald's, you have opportunities 4 advance.
@FATMANski oh, then why does the McDonald's CEO agree with raising it? And look at other states that have raised it, it's worked!
@stiffy_staffy which state? And I read that the founder of McD is against the idea but maybe the current CEO is?
@FATMANski man you gotta research issues before you argue them. Republican pundits aren't going to tell you the facts http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf …
@stiffy_staffy uhh I work for a living so I understand the issue. Please don't assume I listen to pundits; I don't watch tv. #historyrepeats
@FATMANski well there are simple facts. Min wage is an easy discussion bc you can look at states that have raised it vs those who have not
@BarackObama working at McDonald's, and ect isn't supposed to support a family.
@BarackObama @JordanGoins news flash! You're not supposed to. Thoes jobs are for kids & retried people not grown ass adults with no ambition
@BarackObama its easy to do without government interference and Human Service Agencies cramming their two cents down the throats of parents
@BarackObama or you could challenge America to go to college instead, and then try supporting a family on a functional salary ..
@BarackObama this is sooo awesome buahaha! those who say "poor people are poor because they sit on their ass all day" could try this
@BarackObama @maxoday please do not rt Obama on my timeline MAX
@BarackObama come to India n live ..thats the barrier of 80%Indians 
@BarackObama Better messaging: If you want to support your family on more than $15000/yr, work hard, study hard, and get better paying job.
@BarackObama Thank You Mr President for getting it !! And fighting for us ! God Bless
@BarackObama Great point Thank You Mr President God Bless
@BarackObama @bannerite @MzDivah67 @littleredblog @nadiepatah Rt this great tweet by @BarackObama please

@BarackObama  Mr Obama  what you think of the President Italian Republic ? Do you like Mr @Imposimato ?
“@BarackObama: "If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it.#RaiseTheWage dumb
@BarackObama that's why you don't  work at McDonald's and try to raise a family boi.
@BarackObama why don't you just get educated and find another job instead of working for minimum wage? Uneducated people
@BarackObama God bless you! Preach it! Realistic! Open their eyes!
@BarackObama God bless you sir mr president! You DELIVERDT! Very good speech! I'm very optimistic for the future! #youarelove
@BarackObama raise the wage=raise to the cost of goods.their situation stays the same and you gain more in taxes, and everyone else pays 
@BarackObama you're honestly so stupid
“@BarackObama: "If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it."President Obama
@BarackObama You have to earn your income. The people making 15k are making that because they don't deserve more than that. Increasing the
@BarackObama minimum wage increase the price of everything else because you are forcing employers to pay their employees more rise the cost
@BarackObama of production. So either they pay the employee more and raise the price of their product or they terminate them. Neither of
@BarackObama these scenario help with our economy. It also makes it harder on us "middle class" people that don't get higher pay when this
@BarackObama inflation increases due to you think you need to pay someone that flips burgers because he dropped out of high school $10/hour
@BarackObama They wouldn't survive.
@BarackObama did you just quote yourself
@BarackObama
@gregrikaart @BarackObama or try my 8 thousand a year and eat ramen noodles night and day
When @BarackObama said "If you believe you could work full-time/support a family on less than $15k a year, go try it"
@BarackObama min wage jobs R 4 college students. Create high paying jobs by educating workforce not by hurting consumers. It will cost jobs
@BarackObama @chefboimanny
@BarackObama @DoctorGoodleg guarantee more money for the lower class nothing for the middle class so I have to work harder pay more taxes
@MedicSBK not necessarily. I think we can find common ground in some of these issues and get something done for a change.
@DoctorGoodleg I don't. Only way is to push the private industry to pay everyone more. Good luck w that
@MedicSBK it's not a new idea. Henry Ford had it first. It sparked 2+ generations of brand loyalty and corporate stability.
@NikoWavy @BarackObama been there done that.....made 51,700$ this year and still stuggling....we always gonna struggle living average lifes.
“@BarackObama: "If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it."”
@BarackObama @Amber17Dawn but if you can only manage $15,000 a year. Why would try to start and/ or maintain a family?
@Chanlerclarke That's the worst argument I've ever heard for this.
@BarackObama @MegRaeB raising minimum wage will increase the cost of everything. #econ101
@BarackObama try it in CA with 30k

@BarackObama
@BarackObama @srego76 how about better price controls and not charging an arm & a leg for healthcare? Then you can live on $15000 a yr!
@BarackObama then you just raise the cost of living all products are based off minimum wage  god society is dumb.  I hate America sometimes
@BarackObama
@BarackObama oke dehhh
@BarackObama maybe the assholes shouldn't reproduce if they can't support them . #coathanger #Morningafterpill #birthcontrol
@BarackObama limit all legal income for senators, congressmen to USD15K a year, and no govt subsidies or donations allowed to let them try.
,@BarackObama I won't because I actually have ambition.
@AZcutieee @BarackObama that is an unfair statement, just because somebody makes that a year doesn't mean they don't have ambition.
@SweetMelody06 it also means they have no skills that are applicable in today's job market. Want better wages? Have better skills.
@AZcutieee Again, there are so many factors that ambition sometimes had nothing to do with it.  While they are trying to get better skills
@BarackObama Qué bueno que desafíe a los senadores y representantes a que traten de vivir con menos de 15 mil $ al año
@BarackObama  #RaiseTheWage  now!
@BarackObama well maybe if 30 year olds who didn't finish high school didn't have 5 kids to support we wouldn't have an issue.
@BarackObama it is amazing that people buy this stuff.  Curious is u ever worked for minimum wage and had to make choices & budget yourself

@BarackObama Impossible!!! I can barely support myself.  I can't imagine a family.
@BarackObama Stop tweeting, ur giving a speech
seriously a well thought-out, practical speech. in general too. with und\ fundamental themes of putting the usa proper first @BarackObama
@BarackObama All the people replying to this saying its their choice... Like do you really think they want this. Shut the hell up
@BarackObama supporting a family is not what minimum wage is for. Why don't you encourage people to do more for themselves than the minimum?
@BarackObama PREACH
@BarackObama you tell 'em obama
@BarackObama Itee Obama lol
@BarackObama why would you start a family if you were earning less that $15,000 a year? and why encourage that we should "go try it"?!
“@BarackObama: "If u truly believe you could work full-time & support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it." #RaiseTheWage” what
@BarackObama done it. it's not pretty
