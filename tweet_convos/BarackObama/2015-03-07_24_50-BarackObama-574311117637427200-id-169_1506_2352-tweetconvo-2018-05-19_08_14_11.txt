@HotNostrilsrFun Only Natives are not "illegals" Rest of country is made up of "illegals". Remember 1st settlers were kicked out of England.
@HotNostrilsrFun We are all a product of our descendants, so live it one way or another, consciously or unconsciously. Wealth is inherited.
@HotNostrilsrFun It's far easier to succeed when you are blessed w/ wealthy educated parents. I never let myself forget that.  #blessed
@tgatp @HotNostrilsrFun Easier yes! But not impossible.

@BarackObama I agree with you, but if u become disabled while you work, and u get to draw disability is great, but least $ mo. Is unreal.
