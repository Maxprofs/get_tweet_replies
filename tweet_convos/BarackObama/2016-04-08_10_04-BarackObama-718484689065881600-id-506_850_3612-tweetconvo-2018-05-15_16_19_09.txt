@BarackObama We've had paid sick leave for quite a while here in Germany. It works, our economy hasn't crashed yet ;) So get it done!
@BarackObama Americans. Not just  American workers. Productivity of a society is dependent on optimal health and skills of all members.
@kltblom @BarackObama You could throw moral in there too.  Remind me why I should give a shit about worthless people sapping of the gov?
@Taintersniff @BarackObama No
@Taintersniff @BarackObama Few ppl seem to understand why being born to neglectful parents should not = no health, education or opportunity.

@BarackObama Great!
@BarackObama @OFA needs limits and rules. This can lead to lower salary offering. Health appearance may weigh more in hiring decision
@BarackObama We shouldn't have to choose between a paycheck and paying your health care subsidies.
@BarackObama @OFA paid sick leave would increase quality of life for everyone. Less time sick, less coworkers getting ill, good for business
@BarackObama @OFA I'm not american but I agree.
@BarackObama Amazes me: The people who complain about benefits for We the People never complain about the cost of stupid wars. WTF?
@BarackObama @OFA  I couldn't agree more. I see it everyday.
@BarackObama @OFA you're giving illegals social security and Medicare!!
#donald #trump #amarican #workers #usa
@BarackObama @OFA Health is important as well as paypacket,it is the later that sustains and compliments the former,money answers all things
@BarackObama @OFA I agree, my life is a daily battle, and growing up in poverty is no help. A I couldn't help what happened to me.
@BarackObama The ACA is falling apart & costs are skyrocketing. The exchanges are a mess, healthcare companies & doctors quitting.
@BarackObama @OFA Sick pay is a basic right for workers.
@BarackObama @OFA absolutely without question
@BarackObama @OFA 5 days a year,  no more no less
@BarackObama Only if the PRIVATE company pays for sick leave. Isn't the govt paying for too much as it is??!!!??!!!!!!!
Agree!
@BarackObama @OFA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
@BarackObama @OFA we do....
@BarackObama @OFA yes President You Are the Best In the world
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama sure
@BarackObama @OFA We the American people are voting for Donald trump because you didn't do the job we elected you for.
@BarackObama @OFA well Obama if your so call  Obama care wasn't so expensive than we wouldn't had to choose between are paycheck,
@BarackObama @OFA but not having a choice to have health care or not due to federal imposed HEALTHCARE is something many peopke don't want.
@BarackObama Mr President, check us out on YouTube, Fab5 Reggae band,, what agwaan Mr President?
@BarackObama @OFA i agree! fyi: half my #studentloan went to health insurance
@BarackObama @OFA A healthy and globally competitively educated American citizenry is a #nationalsecurity must.
@BarackObama for?
@BarackObama Yeah but we also dont want to have to pay if we dont have health insurance. so therefore we have to anyway
@BarackObama @OFA  I agree
@BarackObama @OFA I bet you wouldn't last long and you would be mumbling and grumbling
@BarackObama @OFA I'd like to see some of you get jobs at minimum wage and see how long you last with your own rules
@BarackObama @OFA no one out here in the working world is happy
@BarackObama @OFA you guys in office failed the working people and continue to fail.Obama is a puppetThe people behind him are running show
@BarackObama @OFA not to mention the enormous penalty each year if you decide to go without healthcare because it's costs are astronomical
@BarackObama @OFA didyouknow with Obama care you need to get maternity coverage even if u are elderly, have hysterectomy, or don't want kids
@BarackObama @OFA this Obama care needs to get amended asap. Not right how much they charge and punishes women and working class people.
@BarackObama but thanks to you, they do now!
@BarackObama listen to your heart Mister president ,endorse Bernie Sanders!!!
@BarackObama @OFA Hardworking people give so much  of themselves to their jobs - paid sick leave is the decent thing to do
,,
@BarackObama @OFA
@BarackObama @OFA forever loving Barack really the president risen me we could in Illinois after but I am LA California ty chief up
@BarackObama Americans should be free to pursue their economic interests w/o govt. interference. Central command not as efficient as freedom
@BarackObama @OFA Let's talk about serious shortcomings of Obamacare first! Don't get me wrong. I'm a serious democrat and have a story to..
@BarackObama @OFA consequently, we need a single-payer health system! #HealthyAmerica!
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama no but they should be able to get the insurance they want without the gov. being involved . Also it is unconstitutional
@BarackObama @OFA why are American citizens even paying for healthcare? Greatest nation in the world! Tax payer funded profits for all!
@BarackObama Yes, but your gal #Hillary takes huge donations from big pharma and health insurance companies.
@BarackObama Doctors are over prescribing certain drugs because there is money in it for them. God is the only healer.
@BarackObama I agrée because i am ill a hospital for being sick all week.
@BarackObama @OFA srs.no investigate the corrupt police of miami federal prison ? who steals money from deportees
@BarackObama Coverage and care are 2 different things.
@BarackObama @OFA FREE SYRIA ARMY IS WARRING WITH DAEŞ. WHY ARE YOU NOT HELPING FOR THEY.
@BarackObama Think this is a false choice, you're just pitting.
@BarackObama @OFA is that why managed care plans are pulling out of exchanges?  It doesn't work
@BarackObama To what extent is the doctor offering his medicines as fraudulent currency? God is the only healer.
@BarackObama I agree with you.But I knew you were going to kill our economy.Covering up that wrong turn doesn't mean no one saw.
@BarackObama @OFA  absolutely agree. Your an amazing one of a kind, mr. President.
@BarackObama @OFA. No
@BarackObama @OFA what if you don't agree?  Can I still add a comment?
@BarackObama please money you send dosent make it to our school/students its stopped by administrators who work the system let me explain
@BarackObama please our kids education is under attack, not more money, laws that govern superintendents and districts need to be changed
@BarackObama @OFA ALL companies should pay for sick leave.  NOT JUST GOV. EMPLOYEES! !!
@BarackObama Agree but for many these become merely vacation days when they call in sick & they are not sick. Not sure of how 2 solve that.
@BarackObama @OFA didn't you already kind of take that away forcing us to buy health insurance? Pot this is kettle calling. Guess what?
@BarackObama I do very much agree. The next Flu virus that almost kills me I want the option of health care when I need it most.
@BarackObama  The next Flu Virus that almost kills me I want to have the option for health care when I need it most
@BarackObama  I very much agree :)
@BarackObama Husband lost job recently; just signed up for insurance through Affordable Health Care.  Thank you!
@BarackObama @OFA your damn right
@BarackObama needs to fix it now!!! Use your Executive Order! Put it in motion at least. Stop playing golf Barry!
@BarackObama DUH!!! WHO created Obamacare? I think U DID! people cant afford the health care NOW, thanks for nothing...
@BarackObama You & the US Gov have absolutely no right to tell private businesses what they should provide.Exactly why your a dictator.
@BarackObama In all Creation God is the only author of life and the only healer. All the restoration of us are only sinners.
@BarackObama I agree because from a fact that I really believe in is that our health is our pensions.
@BarackObama  I agree 100%
@BarackObama @OFA every company should be mandated to provide sick paid leave. No matter the size of the company.
@BarackObama @OFA 1/3 of a teacher's salary (with 3 dependents)!  But worse: $3k deductible. HMO=doctors w/speed not quality in mind.
@BarackObama These should by synonymous.
@BarackObama Bankruptcy courts are filled with American workers who couldn't "afford" to get sick.
@BarackObama @OFA We deserve 2 be allowed sick days because prevention is clearly not important. 
@BarackObama @OFA But we obviously do. I have 2 pay out-of-pocket 4 a Nutritionist because it's not a covered expense.  What is that about?
@BarackObama Si les soins de santé sont trop chers, les entreprises et l'état devront avoir leurs propres services de soin de santé.
@BarackObama Si les travailleurs ne peuvent payer leur soin de santé, les entreprises devront le faire pour avoir leur travail de qualité.
@BarackObama @OFA will this result in another tax for not being able to afford healthcare insurance???????????????
@BarackObama tarih sizleri yargılacak ben kürdüm türküm bunu hesabı vereceksiniz pyd pkk ya destek veriyorsunuz dünya fanidir ülüm var
@BarackObama My comment? Politicians! Stop spending $ that is not yours! That we can't afford!!!!
@BarackObama @OFA ..that should be applicable to all the workers world over..not just America
@BarackObama @OFA  I agree. If you don't have health, you can't make your own money!
@BarackObama stop giving to the refugees and the illegals and ww wouldnt have this problem,take care of our vets and the american citizens.
@BarackObama @OFA We already do!! We can't afford health care if we want to put food on our tables!!
@BarackObama Keep all hallucinatory drugs out of all the world's hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons by the power of Your word O God.
@BarackObama @OFA like the mo: do your job or you get extra sugar in your coffee
@BarackObama @OFA I am not USA employee but agree with this step. All shud think like you for their employees @PMOIndia
@BarackObama that is why we need another Democrat in the Whitehouse - and for all Dems to unite behind whomever wins the nomination
@BarackObama I differ sir there has to be a balance.keep your self in the same question shoes even you prefer to have both.
@BarackObama @OFA https://www.gofundme.com/UrbanLounge 
@BarackObama Yes, Completely Agree!
@BarackObama American workers need to rise above the working poor. Let that be the mission.

@BarackObama @OFA I'm glad I live in the UK. If I'm sick I don't go to work and still get paid
@BarackObama @OFAo.       Obama has fuck us with bullshit Heath care plain it suck ask anyone
@BarackObama affordable healthcare is an epic & noble aim to achieve what most cynics say is unattainable: the common good
@BarackObama @OFA payed chack bcz @USA is runing behind money money 
@BarackObama If the sickness is genuine and natural it must be paid.
@BarackObama @OFA you are Right!!
@BarackObama Agreed. I will miss you Mr. Obama
@BarackObama I agree but You gave The People No Choice. Middle Class is Shrinking!
@BarackObama @OFA 哦
@BarackObama @OFA I agree with you and thank you for that. You are a good president.
@BarackObama @OFA it should be spread out in 3rd world countries.
@BarackObama I do not agree, it should be co-ordinated
@BarackObama WTF Obamacare is NOT working! ACA takes a bigger bite out of your paycheck and getting BIGGER!
@fredypizza @StikNtheMud @BarackObama Wait till next year...when all the "hidden little nuances" of the bill go into effect!
@BarackObama @OFA this is a stupid question. Of course they should have to choose. Life is about choices. It's called freedom
@BarackObama @OFA I agree.
@BarackObama @OFA it's true
@BarackObama @OFA  I do. I agree sir
@BarackObama @Yeah，I have the same sense！Every one is equal！The world -so wide，we should be friendly to everybody！
@BarackObama @OFA That is so true Job over health insurance; should come together.
@BarackObama @OFA Agree, also the healthcare system needs to be completely overhauled and regulated. No one should lose their due illness
@BarackObama @OFA 
Should not give paid leave its

@BarackObama @OFA you take our pay checks. Then tell us our insurance is free. #president of lies
@BarackObama @OFA not just American but any one and everyone in world.
@BarackObama @OFA Sir BO,The best and best President of USA, time has come to make a ammendment & extend the period of the president.
@BarackObama @OFA Health doesn't cost money!
@barackobama  sure, they should be able to get medical treatments and checkups without fearing the fees involve.
@BarackObama Obmamcare was a disaster at the expense of the taxpayer
@BarackObama @OFA Yes we Believe!
@BarackObama @OFA I'm lucky to live in NY, one of few states offering short-term disability. Rest of the country needs to get up to speed!
@BarackObama Add a vote if you agree, Obama is in Cali attending fundraisers on your dime wasting our money.
@BarackObama @OFA Yes. My health insurance Premiums went up 300% in 7 years. My wages a lot less. From $400 to $1300 monthly. End Obamacare!
@BarackObama I have a nasty scar that proves I've done this (couldn't afford stitches).
@BarackObama I'm waiting for that $2500.00 you promised. LIE!
@BarackObama @OFA it just makes sense. Which is exactly why the GOP is against it. #cantfixstupid
@BarackObama @OFA  My health is shot, I can't work. If my work wears me down & pays too little I eventually get sick. How's that working?
@BarackObama @OFA no they shouldn't have to choose.  And we as the world's "super power" should lead this not bring up the rear!
@BarackObama @OFA you promised you'd stop outsourcing
@BarackObama me adota nunca te pedi nada
