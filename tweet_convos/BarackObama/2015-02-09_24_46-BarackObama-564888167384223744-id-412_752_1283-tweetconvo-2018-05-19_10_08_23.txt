@BarackObama thank god. I was really tired of paying for all of that.
@jackjack9215 @BarackObama "Paying for all that" WHAT exactly?!
@LunaMoon137  oh you must not know much about Obamacare. Do some research and get back to me.
@jackjack9215 I KNOW everything about it! I use it and love it! Your answer demonstrates YOU know not a single fact about it. Typical BS
@LunaMoon137 Im sure you have a nice iphone 6 that your welfare check bought you though. #yourwelcome
@jackjack9215 NO jerk. I'm a high school English teacher. And by the way it's "you're" NOT "your." #you'rewelcome
@LunaMoon137 thanks for the english lesson. I'm an engineering major so spelling isn't all that important to me, bit thank you anyway.
@jackjack9215 @LunaMoon137 if you are a high school English teacher doesn't that make you exempt from Obamacare? Your Union negotiated for U
@BarackObama And Millions lost it when you put the ACA in place.
@Josamey44 More millions have it now.
@theAuthoritah Because they were forced to get it. I was forced. I don't want\need ins to go to doctor once a year. $125 vs 1000`s. #bs
@Josamey44 So if u get involved in accident or come down w/ critical disease u just want to be irresponsible.
@theAuthoritah Not your business but I was uninsured for many years and always paid my own way. The ACA is not affordable.
@Josamey44 @theAuthoritah Then go buy your own. No one is stopping you!
@CharlieHackett8 @theAuthoritah And no one asked you.  I have insurance, thanks!!!
@Josamey44 @theAuthoritah If you don't want public opinion then don't use a Social Network to voice your views! Don't knock what we all need
@BarackObama Don't worry CA has your back. They even played an hour long informercial geared at illegals.
@mrzmazz @BarackObama not everyone that speaks Spanish is undocumented
@ambernoelleb What does this mean? immigration? @BarackObama
@BarackObama and millions won't be fined by your socialist Health Care you buffoon. NOBODY believes a word u say. Mr press except blacks
@bisignano912704 @BarackObama All my white friends plus me would all gladly vote #TwoMoreTerms for #Obama if we could! You're just racist.
@CharlieHackett8 @BarackObama let me guess your white friends are Democrats?
@BarackObama I am losing more medical treatment thanks to Obama care
@BarackObama and millions of americans premiums won't go up to pay for it liberal liar!!!! nice try with scare tactic boy
@bisignano912704 @BarackObama Millions Americans would go back to their better, cheaper plans & IRS would lose millions of tax dollars......
@BarackObama. http://How.Fuck.do  you.think.you are.you an)t the rill president http://bitch.I.am .not scared of.ypu
They'd go back to their crappy plans. MT @BarackObama: Repealing the ACA would mean millions of Americans could lose their health insurance.
@BarackObama Insurance that doesn't cover anything except salaries and overhead, right? Wow! What a great deal!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Ignore these people cause they know not what they do..
@BarackObama would mean i wouldnt have to pay for some thing i cant afford
@BarackObama millions lost it because of it.
@BarackObama It would mean millions would have to pay penalties. The Hill won't ever let that fine (hidden tax on the poor) slide!
.@BarackObama Many have already lost them because of the so called affordable healthcare act.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama are u serious?
@BarackObama This lady got into an accident and wanted to come to hopkins after screaming how she hate the A CA now she happy she got it...
@BarackObama
@BarackObama your not in charge. Republicans are, so be a good community organizer and just do what your told
@BarackObama Maybe MILLIONS wouldn't have lost it because of the ACA #President9Iron
@BarackObama then do it
@BarackObama
@BarackObama that's our right to choose what we want or don't want. Not to be penalized!!!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama It's tragic the #GOP spends all it's time worrying about taking away our #Obamacare than defending our country. #MisguidedGOP
@BarackObama @_elizbieber President #Obama was elected by #AMERICA. We LOVE him & are safer & better off with him! @UnitedBLUE
@BarackObama @jptrib1 I trust you can stop them Mr.President You are our HERO
@BarackObama Do you have any idea how many part-time jobs there are because of Obamacare? You are a clueless asshole.
@BarackObama millions already have. Thanks.
@BarackObama Millions more already have
@BarackObama you mean the millions that you forced to be on government care?  By passing the affordable care act through as a huge tax.
@BarackObama: Yeah, 'cuz millions of OTHER Americans PAY for it!
@BarackObama so the gop shouldnt repeal obama care the gop sucks
@BarackObama I wonder why they dont have an insurance to go to... blame yourself.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama NO. It means Millions of lazy people on welfare will have to actually WORK to pay for things.
@BarackObama. if this repealed will all people get a repeal of payments ?
@BarackObama Путин рулит а обама дерьмо
@BarackObama @areyou0 THEY DON'T CARE!!!!!!!!
@BarackObama hello
@BarackObama like the millions of people who were able to keep their health insurance like u promised...
@BarackObama  kind of like the millions that lost it b/c of the illegal  passing of the ACA. Taxes  start on the House Floor not Senate.
@BarackObama President Obama's ... Is reform of the health care system? Do you think the firm medical spreads to all citizens?
@BarackObama do you mean millions more?  http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/millions-expected-lose-their-current-coverage-under-obamacare …
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama thanks sir
@BarackObama All u have done is lie thur ur whole term can't wait until u are out office
@BarackObama I lost my healthcare plan with ACA. Had to buy a more expensive new plan.
@BarackObama ur wrong. It means that insurance companies would have to actually lower their prices back down 2 compete for our business
@BarackObama Their is no way that the GOP can deny/repeal Americans health insurance if the Affordable Health act is already established!
.@BarackObama Millions lost their health insurance when you imposed "your" and "grubers" idea on Americans
@BarackObama millions lost their insurance b/c of Ocrapcare
@BarackObama they already have. #WorstPresidentEver
@BarackObama Keeping it means most middle class can barely afford it. Oh wait, you want the world to rely on you. Just resign already.
@BarackObama they have now because of obamacare.a lot lost full-time jobs over it.
@BarackObama millions lost their health insurace when it was passed
@BarackObama we would replace it with an affordable H/C and that the government should stay out of our business
@BarackObama why you don't listen to the American people.
@BarackObama Brake the law get all medical and needs met Work hard become disable and you have to bag for help for all your needs met
@BarackObama Обама, ты придурок!
@BarackObama follow
@BarackObama try our deicing #salt
@BarackObama or a job in general so you can stop giving them money for no reason
@BarackObama then why don't they find a job with health insurance
@BarackObama My son (22)!! I am a single mom teacher and can't afford h/c for him otherwise! Can't afford taking his dad to court either!
@BarackObama passing obamacare has already cost people their policies. #repealobamacare #lyingleaders
@BarackObama Correction: repealing the ACA would free up millions from penalties and prevent their life saving meds costs skyrocketing.

@BarackObama Russia needs to know your serious not a pushover like it looks to the world
.@BarackObama I was all for your #aca  plan and defended it to others. But now that we applied and see its NOT #affordable and no #subsidy 
@BarackObama I guess. then that mean Watch you step down fakl break you're leg cause its going to cost for the cast. A your Doc..
@BarackObama 世界経済は、ふつう、混沌としている。
@BarackObama Mr.B. Obama you and your previous colleagues are the reason of many millions peoples bad health systems through capitalism.why?
@BarackObama that not good, I love my health insurance
@BarackObama https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wqPg2vNVUM …     ======][.=[;.
@BarackObama this discussion sounds bizar to me. If you're healthy and can work; you pay for the sick. It's called 'a caring society'.
@BarackObama that wil be big case sir if people lose their health insurance in your country
@BarackObama I'm not even gonna comment.  #CantFoolNinja
@BarackObama yes
@BarackObama 
Help India 
Than India Will help India America
@BarackObama It would also mean my mother wouldn't be paying nearly 20,000 in premiums a year with no subsidy despite only making 42k a year
@BarackObama Mr. President, we want to you please fight for those who can't fight for health care # leadership #
Dear @barackobama Console @narendramodi for losing Delhi. @sushmaswaraj @leehsienloong @tsheringtobgay @johnkeypm @foreignhina @mrkrudd
@BarackObama @sevenbowie But from the GOP'rs perspective...fewer Democratic voters.
@the_devik @BarackObama Sadly, I wouldn't put it past them to think of it that way. #GOP is sorely lacking a moral conscience.
@BarackObama OMG idol  love you  ....
@BarackObama nedopustit ubližovat NEVINNÉMU lidu všude na tomto světu.
@BarackObama would also mean that TENS of MILLIONS of Americans would pay LOWER premiums & have LOWER deductibles #FullRepealNow
@BarackObama non va bene. Barack lei è il boss ed è obbligato a fare molto
Ciao ciao è  il bene di tanti americani
@BarackObama too bad I already lost mine because my job could no longer afford to pay the higher premiums #RepealObamaCare
.@BarackObama 
The SOLE reason it's "Affordable" ....for a few - 
Are the $100s of Millions in taxes redirected from hardworking Americans.
@BarackObama if toy want your crappy overpriced insurance, you can keep it. Just like my doctor...
Screw your Fraud & lies-Criminal Scum! This is a new way to extort money & milk Americans like cows-go to hell- TRAITOR SCUM! @BarackObama
@BarackObama Do you know that your comment on religious intolerance in India encouraged Indian Church to issue dictate to vote against BJP?
@BarackObama   Do I have to work harder to pay for the free stuff you give to buy votes?  Just need to know.
Passing it cost millions their insurance. You didn't seem to care then. @BarackObama
@BarackObama  Yes, then they can get real health insurance and not your bullshit obama care!!!!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Also means less debt, less govt, less socialism.
Not you, too? RT @paberk: @BarackObama Also means less debt, less govt, less socialism.
@BarackObama how would that be any different from the millions that lost theirs as a result of your spurious legislation
@BarackObama well I believe starting with you it'll make the world go around at no expense keep up the good work :)
The Audacity of Lies.
How many millions of Americans lost their health plans after @BarackObama promised: http://www.youtuberepeater.com/watch?v=gdj5bEXZ_0E&s=4368&e=4405 …?
Like when it passed? "@BarackObama: Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean millions of Americans could lose their health insurance:
“@BarackObama: Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean millions of Americans could lose their health insurance" - like when it passed??
@BarackObama - That's being paid for by the other millions. I say repeal it
“@BarackObama: Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean millions of Americans could lose their health insurance: http://ofa.bo/e2iW ”
@BarackObama Necesito urgemente    aprender   ingles
@BarackObama I lost my health insurance and my job because of the Affordable Care Act.
@BarackObama @PlantFlowes it's the GOP version of the purge
@BarackObama - oh because no one has lost their health insurance and have been kicked off their plans already? @AFPhq
@BarackObama And not have to pay a fine for not having insurance? I'll take a repeal
Hi @BarackObama 

Jordan killed more ISIS militants in FIVE DAYS than the US has in SIX MONTHS 

STOP BLOWING OUR TAX DOLLARS #ThanksObama
@Bloviate_Barbie @BarackObama JAWD
@BarackObama #GiveHealthCareAChance
@BarackObama
@BarackObama just like millions of people lost their doctors & plans
@BarackObama #repealObamacare
@BarackObama and a big relief for TENS OF MILLIONS who LOST their AFFORDABLE health insurance
@BarackObama  It would also mean lots of Christians would be able to have the freedom to get health insurance.
@BarackObama http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_bank …
@BarackObama If you care about America- listen, compromise & work with congress. Remember you are suppose to represent all the people 
@BarackObama That sounds like what happened to millions and millions of Americans when Obamacare took effect... more #ObamaLies !!
@BarackObama @QuantumHumanity One way 2 solve the RW whining..
Privatized 4 RW who choose 2 pay Insurers
Public Option for the rest.
Easy ;)
@BarackObama
Health Care Matters;
Caring 4 your Health Matters More;
Any chance we could Focus some Energy here too?
@BarackObama I will laugh when Obamacare is repealed through reconciliation, the same way it was passed.
@BarackObama you mean like the millions who lost it or are paying higher prices because of O care? Repeal!
@BarackObama I'm saddened by the bigotry & greed shown here. One's health SHOULD NOT be placed at the mercy of corporations & profits.
@BarackObama And that would be a good thing but it will be replaced with real affordable H.C. not controlled by the government
@BarackObama  She has to have more major surgery in April. Over $200,000.00 in med bills!!!
@BarackObama  My Mom almost died due to misdiagnoses in October. Her insurance saved her big time with her med bills.
@BarackObama Families need health in the life. Obmacare is solution.
@BarackObama we can't let this happen never
@BarackObama It will also result in financial ruin for many people. Currently, most hospital admissions and treatments are extremely costly.
@BarackObama @braintwat I can't stop laughing!
@R_del_Mar @BarackObama~I would love to see a #fullrepeal of #ACA, after #SCOTUS  shreads this #illegalact. #Gruber&#TheImpostor #shareacell
> #repealObamacare < A worthless POS law that was un-necessary and overly intrusive from the jump @BarackObama
@BarackObama ~#Millionslosttheirpolicies already because of this #hoaxperpetratedagainst #WethePeople. I hope #gruber shares a #cellwithyou
@BarackObama How many of u jackass libs have a $6.000 deductible who paying that?#oblamea
@BarackObama And we can afford your obama care? Lies, Lies! millions  lost insurance #repealObamacare
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Then they should get jobs and buy their own.
@BarackObama I remember being rejected for insurance numerous times before the affordable care act came into being.
@BarackObama if it means the cost of my insurance going down then I'm ok with that!
@BarackObama something does smell fishy though if majority of Congress dem/repub  do not want aca why would the president keep vetoing  it?
@BarackObama keep it" or if ur over 55 u will not pay more then what you have already been paying.
@BarackObama I do not necessarily hate the aca, I just hate all the read the fine print BS. What ever happened to "if u like ur old ins
@BarackObama When anyone is uninsured, we pay in the end anyway. Hey 'Publicans ... Preventative Health Care is essential.
@BarackObama We need more PSA's explaining how the ACA works & all of the wonderful benefits it covers.  Everyone gets sick, Republicans to.
@BarackObama
@SpeakerBoehner why wld u meet w/Netanyahu w/o clearing the Mtg w/the 114
Congress come on I'd give u more common sense than that?
@BarackObama a lot of working people have already lost insurance thanks to ACA, Mr Obama stated that wouldn't happen
@BarackObama AND BILLIONS COULD BE SAVED
@BarackObama Stop lying to everyone Obama
@BarackObama more government = higher costs
@BarackObama oh no that's terrible!!
Is that the only way millions would lose coverage #KingvBurwell RT @BarackObama: Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean millions...
@BarackObama
@BarackObama

#StopTheExecutionOfSamanNaseem
@BarackObama ok not sure why everyone is mad about health care. Even 3 world countries have it.
@BarackObama  how many times are they going to try to repeal. Take the money and help the citizens without medical  coverage.
@BarackObama ты долбоеб
@BarackObama Boehner & 239 others in Republican-Controlled House voted for the 56th time to kill uninsured & send the rest back to the ER.
@BarackObama Tell Potus: The Eagle has Landed. https://www.facebook.com/kairoshetonvermijdelijke …? will reveal the future. Translate this for info.
@BarackObama Obama care is a lie.  You lied to all of us.  I stood up for you & you let me down, big time.
