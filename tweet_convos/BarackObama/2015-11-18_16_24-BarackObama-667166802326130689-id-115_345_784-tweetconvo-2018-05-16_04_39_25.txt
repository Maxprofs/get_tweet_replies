@SecBurwell @BarackObama @HealthCareGov because they are being forced to choose a plan in the first place
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @HealthCareGov I'm a ACA supporter but, come on, it's not like they had a choice
@SecBurwell  @HealthCareGov 
Cuz they were forced by high prices and gvmt regulation. Yay. You made a law and people had to follow it.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @HealthCareGov They should be good Americans and not have insurance.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @HealthCareGov tell me again why health insurance exists, why this isn't a right.  Or just pat yourself on the back
@SecBurwell @BarackObama @HealthCareGov that is a sad low number...
