.@BarackObama Sweet. Now do workforce participation.
@CoFemale  that makes no sense. So unemployment went down because there are no jobs?
@CoFemale well it's at a forty year low. So he has produced more jobs than any president in forty years. People are just never satisfied.
@CoFemale truth? Because all you say is vague  statements of opinion not fact. You sound like Fox News. Blindly following ideology
@BarackObama Part time work. No raises. Those still looking depletion. Yeah, ask anyone how great it is on welfare.
@Larry_Kelly  most of the wealth disparity is a result of corporate greed not the president fault. Companies give raised not president
@princeplus1 The local franchise holder of my KFC, the IGA grocery store barely making a go of it, our public library... Corporate greedy?
@Larry_Kelly this tweet made no sense. If your public library is funded poorly that is a local political problem. Are republicans in charge?
@princeplus1 All these places are struggling to pay wages, dummy. Our library funded by endowments and fund raisers.
@Larry_Kelly also more money in people pocket should trickle down to places that need t right?  It did you already forget about Reagan?
@BarackObama THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER
