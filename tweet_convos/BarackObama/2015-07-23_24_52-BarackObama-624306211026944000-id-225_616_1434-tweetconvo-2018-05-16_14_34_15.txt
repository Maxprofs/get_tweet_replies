@BarackObama Minimum wage is a starting point. Not a lifetime aspiration. Based on inflation. Shouldn't minimum wage already be $22 an hour?
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage Because ideology trumps math. So what if Minimum wage hikes increase unemployment. We have to stick it to the 1%!
@BarackObama have a drink together, toningt?
@BarackObama You gonna give SS fixed income folks a 22 percent increase to keep pace with the resulting inflation, or we just starve?
