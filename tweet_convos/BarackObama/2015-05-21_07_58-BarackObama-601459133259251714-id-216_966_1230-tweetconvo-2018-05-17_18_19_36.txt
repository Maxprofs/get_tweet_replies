@WhiteHouse I don't believe the numbers. How exactly will a 1ft increase in sea level cost the American people $200 billion?
@WhiteHouse Syria's climate change problems are the reason ISIS happened, according to Prez O. He actually said that. #SMH
@WhiteHouse $200 billion is a sneeze for the wasteful spending of our government.
@WhiteHouse this is important? GO AFTER ISIS. & FEED OUR HUNGRY FAMILIES IN AMERICA!
@WhiteHouse 
How does this compare to a Wall Street bail-out?
@U_Megabyte
@WhiteHouse If 1ft of water could cost the U.S. $200 billion, then consider the Obama administration a 100ft tidal wave.
@WhiteHouse Gore said it was already supposed to happen?????
@WhiteHouse so let's spend the 200 on something that will change the way we do things. In fact let's spend 400B and make sure it works.

@WhiteHouse What's your public vehicle driving  policy?  You can help end traffic jams & reduce pollution by million of gallons a year.
@WhiteHouse @sierraclub $200 billion is but a small price to pay for the rewards of Arctic and Atlantic drilling and worldwide fracking.
