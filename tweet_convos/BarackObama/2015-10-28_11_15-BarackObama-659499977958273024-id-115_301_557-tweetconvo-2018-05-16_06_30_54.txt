@WhiteHouse 
日本の借金が10兆円位あるのに、国会議員(自民党公明党)は、贅沢し放題。給料と支持率下げずに税金を上乗せする事しか考えていないです。国民貧乏で、総理贅沢しまくり。総理が贅沢する金で借金返せると思いますが。
@WhiteHouse 
日本の大阪都構想って赤字のはずなのに、税金を上乗せして他人の金で、変な計画を立てる橋下市長にごー喝お願いいたします。
@WhiteHouse The government creates enabling environment that facilitates the private sector and business owners to create jobs!!!
@WhiteHouse stop spewing your lies....
@WhiteHouse I'd like to see some government cutting jobs in Congress since they are STILL THE DO NOTHING CONGRESS..
@WhiteHouse My favorite part is hearing Mark Levin's squeaky little voice quiver with poutrage. Do it again!
@WhiteHouse what I like to see is some government wage cuts n sorry don't believe government creates jobs but I support president Obama
@WhiteHouse @PhilDeCarolis Bullshit. The government doesn't create jobs, business owners do.
@WhiteHouse Government jobs or private sector jobs?
@WhiteHouse Maybe it will in your Wolkenkuckucksheim Weltanschuuang, but not in reality
@WhiteHouse this deal steals from our children.
@WhiteHouse The magic @POTUS wins again...
@WhiteHouse Meanwhile real unemployment is up over 20% and steadily rising. Bottom line is our JV team in the WH has failed. So they lie.
@WhiteHouse bullshit
