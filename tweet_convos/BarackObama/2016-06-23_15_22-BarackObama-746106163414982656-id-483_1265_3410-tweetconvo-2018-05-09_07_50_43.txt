@OFA come on America! End all this violence #gunviolence #guncontrol
Then BOOM & start over?????
but we cant use nothing of that for war for the project
When Dems kept guns away from freed slaves in the 1800s, it helped the Dems build the KKK. 

Learning from history isn't fun.
we can do that with water of the beach and the car with 5 propulsor are bigs and of air
we need patents and that for get more benefit
no.  2nd amendment stands.
@OFA nothing is working for me, but you got my voice, mud200
when the secret service give up theirs, then maybe just maybe we will give up ours...but you go first.
@OFA. I may disagree wth u on a fewww issues bt at least ur nt a demagogue moron hu cnt play nice wth othr kids in th sandbox !
Mr Obama, I agree with you. But if Trump becomes a president it is not going to be possible.
don't you get that criminals will get guns, bombs, dirty bombs etc...wherever they can regardless?
@OFA the "laws" you already have set in place don't work, only a maniac would add more laws to laws to keep ppl safe .......
@OFA Taking away our guns only makes us easier targets!
@OFA That said, Congress please do focus your attentions on solving gun violence, just focus on strategies that actually work!
@OFA You know the answer isn't gun control but you continue to force it down America's throats.
@OFA Why when the wolves start killing your focus is on disarming the sheep?
Hate guns BUT u are letting our enemies in who hate gays, Jews,Sunni and Shia don't get along. How will they get along with us.
@OFA . yea... Congress that's on the top of my list of demands.  Smh
@OFA the laws are already there, gun shop warned FBI and did nothing in Orlando.
The Fall of the Obama regime being filled with desperate acts of open hostility towards the American People & Constitution
@OFA where there's a will there's a way. You can't eradicate the way you must eradicate the will
guns are the way Islam creates the will
Islam and the mindset created by 40+years of leftist control of education & mass culture
The route out of the gun violence is to stop gun production and destory existing ones.
#Stopandfrisk is unconstitutional and is still taking place n places like NYC imma need u 2 go head n add this issue b4 u dip

so when I want to vote I need to pay? I don't make it. please explanation
@OFA We will not be disarmed by you. We will not let your Radical Islamic Terrorists come in. Step down, or be impeached.
In Australia we had a terrible mass killing (MURDERS). PM John Howard changed the gun laws. It's never, NEVER happened again.
@OFA Give up your armed guards first you hypocritical POS
@OFA
Weapons are not the problem Mr.President ideologies are." I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery" Thomas Jefferson.
@OFA #hillary4prison she has killed more with GAS and BOMBS #HILLARY4PRISON
Allow us to defend ourselves rather than have to wait 3 hours for law enforcement to do anything! #Orlandoshooting
we will fight until we get it done Mr. president no assault weapons on the streets of America
@jaisandp @OFA --politics as usual-even starting to spread amongst Catholicism
say it with me RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST, but you can't because you're a muslim...
homocide rate at 51 year low and personal gun ownership highest ever. Coincidence?  Think not. U care about control not safety
Just enforce the laws already in place! Give harsher sentences for illegal gun ownership and for gun violence. No new laws!
Mr. Trump's fans like me, thank you Obama for ditectly influencing the UK to leave the EU by threatening them not to leave. lol
Congress needs to act but, they never do
Speak up and Demand that Obama  act & do more to fight RADICAL Islami Terrorism! Latinos4Trump
@OFalafel @SgyYogarajah @mcvivek @narendramodi GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT NON VIOLENCE, SO WHY THESE OPPORTUNISTIC DENYING

I just own a shrink wrap gun :#)
yes yes yes 
@OFA England left the EU. Pretty soon you will be gone on January 20. A good day for America
Maybe when you take action on private prisons and mandatory minimum sentences. But, since you probably won't....
“SPEAK-UP FOR” http://easycolorexpress.com 
@OFA Nothing said about the threats by the Islamofascists.  Amazingly ignorant or appeasing
@OFA yes we can still remain a large focus on our mind,handle this gun voilence even if it will take veto power
@OFA 世纪笑话美国禁枪
what may seem "common sense" to a @POTUS who probably cries when he gets a paper cut does not work for every day Americans.
gun bans instead of attacking real issues that cause violence only proves that @POTUS wants to strengthen govt power over us.
It's interesting how @POTUS refuses to protect us from terrorists & criminals but keeps pushing gun bans for everyone.
I am speaking up to @POTUS to act on VIOLENCE whether it's gun, knife, car or baseball bat. #DisarmHate stop gun bans.
Disappointed that the Supreme Court didn't vote to fix immigration by giving work visas.
hello
indefatigable logic shows that no guns mean less people die at the end of one.Wake up America -the constitution needs to change
@bagai mana pendapat pak obama .penemuan saya ok kan,
@OFA UK GOT IT RIGHT
zhangxingguo said he would pay more attention to this incident
Voice?  What about action?  Talk is sooooo cheap.  But where is the leadership that turns the tide?  Where?
@POTUS You are the only one that can persuade the British people who approve BREXIT. http://bloom.bg/28Um0KE 
The stance of democratic members have changed the playing field and ordinary men and women must now demand changes gun laws.
@OFA regrettable un pays comme les états -unis convoitent encore des armes à feux librement au xxième siècle
why
@OFA Lol Trump 2016. England just told obama to suck a dick.
you'ed better stop this law from hacking my #Dogs . thats real BO
Please here all can yes, does you also? Is easy: add your voice and the name also, Is better that all to blame, was *USA!
@OFA yes he is right. Congress need to change the guns laws (a little at least) the Australian experience proves Barack correct
@OFA NOO!
@OFA Hey Obama, thank you for sticking your nose in and helping Vote Leave ! We are at the FRONT of the queue now !
we defintely need to enforce strick background checks for sure i think it's ridiclous that we don't
HAaaaVE at it  LOL
or follow the nj law you cannot transport a gun unless it's locked and unloaded in the truck, and if it's not 20 years jail
i think we should eliminate all violent first person shoot video games and all video games in general biden is right
and the problem is you can even print a physical gun out of these to be soon sold 3-D printers  to the general public
here's the issue 3-dimensional printers are going to be sold retail soon, one stock that makes these printers is  $XOne
@OFA ok
@OFA I appreciate "gun violence prevention" and "gun safety" measures, not "gun control." Yes to common sense change.
A true lame duck with two big loses today. Time for you to move to the "back of the queue". Totally incompetent leftist.
@OFA enforce current laws, why make new laws if you aren't even using the laws you have. Seems to me you just want to disarm us
@OFA you should shut down
@OFA very good
So happy this would stop gang members from buying a gun lol.
@OFA
I agree, we need to rebuild our inner cities and actually do something about the MOTIVE for violence, not just take the weapons
Control Radical Islamists and Terrorists/Lunatics, NOT our firearms and Constitutional Rights that I served to protect!
this decision is ok
@OFA elakan panggunaan senjata kepada orang awam
@OFA YES absolutely
@OFA Says the sleazeball who gave arms to Mexican drug cartels. Up yours.
Change 18 USC § 922 such that the only prohibitions are: people who are adjudicated to be a threat to themselves and/or others
Allow bar and restaurant concealed carry where the person carrying is prohibited from consuming alcohol
yes this is a major problm in u.s.a. But how can lives safe nd secure without gun.
Pass a National law to eliminate all Gun Free Zones that do not have metal detectors and personnel/package screening for ALL
Amend the Federal Gun Free School Zone act to exclude ALL concealed weapons permit holders
Pass a National Concealed Carry Reciprocity bill.
Gun in the hand is American way of life but not the Violence. People should be proactive for noticing who can misuse this.
@OFA We the people demand that Congress act to end illegal immigration and to enact Islam Control
Trump build an an Empire. What did you build?
Let me b clear! Wake up & smell the coffee! Strict gun laws have killed people!
@BarackObama
Why don't you grow a backbone and stop blaming a piece of metal for our problems.
@OFA please It helps the Latino community
It helps the Latino community!!
@OFA Remember the study you had the CDC do on guns in January 2013?
http://www.qbitbux.com/images/728.gif 
@OFA  Yes, now stop the killing,gun that is made for killing, so we should be united and proper way.
