@BarackObama Should regulate the maximum student loan. Some poor folks colleges become a privilege , they can not make it even with loan
@BarackObama I think it is great that you take on all type of issues from the average to top political Well balance.

@BarackObama Dont dare ask my kid to make payments that are not affordable based on their income. Problems will arise! #SupportStudents
@BarackObama
@BarackObama The way the pay back on those school loans needs to be supervised by a third party because students are being scammed.
@BarackObama  is that all you can do? 6 percent or more which is compounded if loan repayment is not started immediately.
@BarackObama o recado que estar para nao acreditar es historia de popper es mentira
@BarackObama Students should take Economics 101. Don't take out a loan you can't pay back. #WakeUpAmeirca
@BarackObama passing the cost off on the over taxed middle class is not the answer! #StopobamasSpinDoctoring

@BarackObama I have been paying back my Student Loans since b4 Hurricane Katrina (12 plus years) & I still owe the exact same amount!
@BarackObama there is no such thing as 'fair' in life, it's a perspective, it's relative, there is no absolute.
@BarackObama I literally don't give a single flying fuck.
