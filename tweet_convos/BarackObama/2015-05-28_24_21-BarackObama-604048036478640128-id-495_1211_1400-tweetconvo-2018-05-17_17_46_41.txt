@jahjahrights @DobbaDobba @WhiteHouse yeah..when  hits the fan
@WhiteHouse Sooo, you know fracking worsens #climatechange, right?
@anatinsly @WhiteHouse Fracking methane emissions! @POTUS keeps tweeting about clean water act but Fracking is exempt from any pollution
@Wiskyeye @WhiteHouse @POTUS Fracking leaks methane, which is more potent than CO2. Supporting #fracking is a form of #climatedenial.
@savingrace2 @anatinsly @WhiteHouse @POTUS Just the fact the you used Rush Limbaugh to argue your case proves your ignorance!
@savingrace2 @anatinsly @WhiteHouse @POTUS head in sand mentality will leave our children with contempt for our inept action to try and fix
@WhiteHouse They told us we'd be out of oil and living in an ICE AGE by the year 2000 back in the 70's #AllLies
@LeoRules1 @WhiteHouse And I thought I'd never see America have a @POTUS who had no balls. I was wrong too. No balls NOR brains now.
@Shadowboxer50 @WhiteHouse @POTUS still waiting on them to bring back "Waste not, want not" LOL
@LeoRules1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS If they'd do that, we could lower the debt AND the deficit would shrink, we KNOW where the waste is, right?
@WhiteHouse it's time for you to shitcan the trade deal
@rougebaisers @WhiteHouse don't hold your breath- no tweets about it either. Just global warming, gay issues & open borders (immigration)
@dave_on_Cape @WhiteHouse of course not it's back room dirty deal it's bad for America and bad for the American worker
@rougebaisers @WhiteHouse Both parties have stopped giving a shit about the people they are supposed to represent.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama a working man who votes republican is like a chicken voting for colonel Sanders
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama did quran told you so? cause there is no climate change .....

#ActOnClimate
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Another lie from the dictatorship.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  You in reality don't care a bit, you murder the people with the solutions to keep wall street profits going
@WhiteHouse @VOTE_HILLARY include in any projections the cost of shoreline beach houses, apts complex land properties
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how much ice on land would have to melt to cause a sea level rise one foot?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Mr president, may I ask you if you can advise  me becuz I need help.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it cost over $9 billion n tax dollars just to clean the ballast tanks of ships. WHY TAX DOLLARS? Wal*Mart polluting
@whitehouse @barackobama #ACTONCLIMATE, thanks you Outstanding Sr President Barack Obama,  for this Information
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama e
@WhiteHouse @BlueNationUntd We are so deep in the river called Denial.
@WhiteHouse @bjs5555 Do you have young children or grandchildren = not make a difference to you ? Don't kid ourselves=already affects us.
@WhiteHouse best regards
@WhiteHouse which would come with a pool of police, security personnel, government officials with human rights watch dogs of US+UN as whole
@WhiteHouse 7th; a 'Formal Government' under United Nations, with UN forces led by US, is the only solution at present. regardless its price
@WhiteHouse in behalf of people of India, i favor to fight with this imposed Dictatorship, no matter how many will have to sacrifice lives
@WhiteHouse sir, we can't lose against terrorism-dictatorship, no matter how much causality will be caused. we want democracy at any price
@WhiteHouse 6th; as any type of sanctions may be avoided this way,we are always ready to pay any price for the sake of our coming generation
@WhiteHouse 5th; hence, it may take upto 10 years to build the "Human Resource Infrastructure" of different government departments of India
@WhiteHouse 4th; it may take upto 5 years for Indian civilian to come out of Depression as a through killing of civilians/officials was done
@WhiteHouse im threatened to think that a big number of military-security personnel have been killed by taking out soul from bodies, Quietly
@WhiteHouse & bodies of those Indian military-security personnel are now occupied by soul of enemy background countries, Bangladesh+Pakistan
@WhiteHouse 3rd; this way India will not face any sanctions, hence expanses of United Nations forces may be paid by Indian Tax Payers easily
@WhiteHouse 2nd; it may take upto 10 years to build military,police/security infrastructure from start again, UN+US forces have to stay here
@WhiteHouse it would be similar to how Hamid Karzai government was working in Afghan under UN, while UN forces struggling in rest of Afghan
@WhiteHouse 1st; we want a 'formal' government of India, under control of UNSC & US, until a fair democratic election is held.
@WhiteHouse sir, i would propose Solution to this ongoing Crisis in India as below:-
@WhiteHouse yo me apunto
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse except NASA-US, none can handle mind of people, take out soul of bodies, control quake-flood-Tsunami, UK is hardly an ally of US
@WhiteHouse Bangladesh as a member of Least Developed countries, can't bear its expanses without foreign aid, they dont have Space Research
@WhiteHouse Foreign nationals helping Dictatorship, while being among common civilians in open too, must be put in Wanted List of Interpol
@WhiteHouse #reward of up to $250.000
http://nyc311reward.blogspot.com 
@WhiteHouse if few things goes wrong, it would be fixed up, thats it. few people might be doing wrong,not hard, who gotto be found, thats it
@WhiteHouse and the hope is maintained in people till last breath. US-UN forces must always be ready for India, must not be delayed anymore
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN
@WhiteHouse there can't be any diplomatic/economic/trade recognition for a country under dictatorship, it has no legal status in world
@WhiteHouse no matter how much causalities is made, we can't say that we can't defend ourselves/our country,every day starts with a new hope
@WhiteHouse and if we may ensure these key things, there will always be enough space to face the challenges imposed on this country as whole
@WhiteHouse i have many doubts which have strong ground.and im always worried for quake-Tsunami-flood threats, along with handling of people
@WhiteHouse India may need UN forces, led by US, for at least upto 10 years, even a fair democratic election may take 2 years from now
@WhiteHouse we can't win this war until we capture those who prepared the "platform" to help form Dictatorship, ... regards
@WhiteHouse and its hard to believe that US-NASA wasn't informed about it. even Japan-Germany can't handle people's mind, quake-Tsunami....
@WhiteHouse the Dictatorship on India was mainly "handled" by those, who were controlling people's mind, quake-Tsunami threats on civilians
@WhiteHouse we must capture those first who had handicapped Indian government agencies to help form dictatorship,while threatening civilians
@WhiteHouse Indian government agencies were,in fact, made "handicapped" so that no resistance is left against the Dictatorship, confirm it
@WhiteHouse we can't win against terrorism-dictatorship targeting a democratic country,until we first capture those who help these offenders
@WhiteHouse and then Dictatorship over India as the Final Step. first conspiracy was plotted to help these offenders supporting Dictatorship
@WhiteHouse its openly done,first civilians of India were terrorized by quake-Tsunami with putting a control over India during last 6 months
@WhiteHouse there is no difference between terrorists targeting civilians, than those who who target civilians by Earth Quake- Flood-Tsunami
@WhiteHouse Offenders occupying government positions of India were first helped by threatening civilians by quake-Tsunami, are they caught?
@WhiteHouse also, first Independence of India was bargained by threatening common civilians by earth quake-Tsunami,has US got guilty behind?
@WhiteHouse we would need over 200,000 military personnel of US+UN, to have a control over India, how long will it take?
@WhiteHouse foreigners helping Dictatorship in a democratic country are regarded as terrorists,who must be killed to help UN forces in India
@WhiteHouse US must kill those foreign nationals occupying govt positions of India, by controlling their bodies,until we get help from US+UN
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals helping dictatorship in another country, while being on soil of India, become part of this terrorism on India
@WhiteHouse the False ID foreign nationals helping Dictatorship, whether on government or in common, must be put in Wanted List of Interpol
@WhiteHouse US+UN forces on alert to enter India,along with whatever immediate government officials may be sent from US+EU to help civilians
@WhiteHouse it first includes Pakistan+Bangladesh whose spies are occupying government positions of India from back door, helped by Britain
@WhiteHouse The Countries guilty in dictatorship-terrorism against Democratic India, must first face sanctions to stop aggression from there
@WhiteHouse with a US aircraft carrier in Arabic Sea also, to seal Indian water borders from the foreign fighters who may sneak into India
@WhiteHouse as they are found guilty in this ongoing terrorism against Largest Democratic Country of world, terrorized with Dictatorship now
@WhiteHouse regardless what happens in India, Saudi A.+UAE must first be imposed with all sanctions, diplomatic/trade all, as the first step
@WhiteHouse and you are responsible to clean your shiits. like how you go to toilet and clear your shiit by yourself, without help of others
@WhiteHouse under a conspiracy, these things were kept secret from common public during last 20+ years. hence you do know what you was doing
@WhiteHouse this process of occupying government positions of India from back door was continued for last 20+ years, which was allowed by US
@WhiteHouse also, Britain placed these foreigners on government positions under False Indian IDs, who first report to British government
@WhiteHouse we can't do serious crimes in another country by 50%+ voting in parliaments of US/UK/Aus, where will we head in future this way?
@WhiteHouse like how my body is controlled from top to bottom from, what measures are adopted to kill these False ID foreigners fighters?
@WhiteHouse hence, it would be easy to kill these offenders/terrorists helping dictatorship in India, by controlling their bodies itself
@WhiteHouse UK/Commonwealth Recruitment know who are they, where they came from, with controlling their bodies too? similar to me?
@WhiteHouse and it would be easy as these people entered into India by "Commonwealth Recruitment", hence you know them, obviously?
@WhiteHouse we want US+UN forces to occupy the key defence areas and government buildings, mainly the nuclear reactors, sooner is possible
@WhiteHouse hence we want direct sealing of Pakistan+Bangladesh border considering mainly spies of these 2 nations are on the govt positions
@WhiteHouse as its now open that False ID spies on government positions helping foreigner nationals,mainly Pakistani+Bangladeshi enter India
@WhiteHouse and we first need to put those foreigners in Wanted List of Interpol,who occupying Indian IDs from back door during dictatorship
@WhiteHouse as common Indian civilians are unarmed,Foreign Nationals entered India since dictatorship,must be put in Wanted List of Interpol
@WhiteHouse Nations helped form dictatorship against the largest democratic country of world, are well qualified for all type of sanctions
@WhiteHouse hence, Saudi A.+UAE must be recognized as rogue nations, involved in this ongoing Terrorism against Largest Democratic Country
@WhiteHouse I'm told, foreign nations like UAE-Saudi Arabia are guiding these False ID offenders occupying key government positions in India
@WhiteHouse the Terrorized India under Dictatorship by foreign nationals with False Indian IDs, placed here under "Commonwealth Recruitment"
@WhiteHouse  the Terrorized India under Dictatorship by False ID foreigners, placed here under "Commonwealth Recruitment"
@WhiteHouse thanks and regards
@WhiteHouse i remember BP oil spill, and this is what British government has done, impacting world's environment now
@WhiteHouse will Britain support these offenders, placed on key positions by themselves under a conspiracy for years,or, help civilians?
@WhiteHouse how other democratic countries of world will respond to this certain scenario of India on the world platform?
@WhiteHouse we want a fair democratic election in India. we can't be ruled by a Dictator and his follower terrorists,entered India illegally
@WhiteHouse we would now need Human Rights watch dogs-journalists in every small town of India
@WhiteHouse mass protests while moving towards government buildings, will they be attacked or killed if they demand a democratic election?
@WhiteHouse i may see from here that common people may start doing protests on road, block roads, shut down of daily businesses activities
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN.
@WhiteHouse a government under Dictatorship has no recognition in world, no diplomatic/trade relation, their sports teams aren't invited too
@WhiteHouse similar to how they denied ISIL threats to enter into Iraq to get key information from there
@WhiteHouse as a world citizen,I now hope brave journalists of world to come to India and have a close watch on the human rights abuses here
@WhiteHouse we can't discuss democracy in our home country, if we don't do its practice on the world platform also
@WhiteHouse India as the largest democratic country of world, and hence it is also part of democratic values of US-UK on the world platform
@WhiteHouse none of above examples of dictator was regarded as less than terrorists.this is main definition of dictators and their followers
@WhiteHouse Dictator like Saddam was hanged as the penalty,Gaddafi of Libya was killed on road while running,but Hitler could be able to run
@WhiteHouse I want India to be declared as a war-zone, on the verge of internal conflicts by foreign infiltrators, occupying govt positions
@WhiteHouse until US-UN bring India under control for a fair democratic election, US must put these offenders under Wanted list of Interpol
@WhiteHouse first Independence of citizens was 'bargained' by quake-Tsunami threats, and the next step dictatorship? both are interlinked...
@WhiteHouse and its impossible to believe that God or US dont know them? what measures were adopted to stop those attacks on the civilians?
@WhiteHouse and its impossible to believe that God or US dont know them? what measures were adopted to stop those acts?
@WhiteHouse its a serious case as controlling minds of people, quake-Tsunami etc can't be done by even Japan-Germany, who are behind this?
@WhiteHouse this is a terrorist attack on Indian citizens, as they were first threatened by earth quake-Tsunami etc to help these offenders
@WhiteHouse there can't be a legal status to the government under dictatorship until a fair democratic election is held under watch by US-UN
@WhiteHouse what measures the US government adopting, until we may have US's soldiers on the soil of India? and how long will it take?
@WhiteHouse Foreign nationals on Government-political positions are making statements to fuel religious riots, purposefully/ intentionally
@WhiteHouse foreign fighters-spies pretend to be similar to Indian Muslims citizens,which is a threat to religious riots among the civilians
@WhiteHouse we want new US embassies in different cities of India to help those civilians who are put under threat by foreign fighters/spies
@WhiteHouse are the victims and their dependents of fatal attacks provided with enough supports, until we have a fair democratic election?
@WhiteHouse does US know fatal attacks on the civilians of India doing usual political talks, as involved? what measures were adopted by US?
@WhiteHouse as per International laws since WW2, no diplomats-civilians talking usual politics can be fatally attacked during any war too
@WhiteHouse my demands are too fair as per international laws, we have even since during WW2, and the International laws must be maintained
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN
@WhiteHouse we demand offenders against "Republic of India", to be put among 'Wanted Terrorists" of world,until they are capture or killed
@WhiteHouse No legal status can be granted to India under dictatorship, until fair democratic election is held, under watch by US and UN
@WhiteHouse the Infiltrators,who infiltrated Indian international border while hiding their identity,by occupying local Indian IDs illegally
@WhiteHouse no foreign government has any right to destroy our country, our families/homes are based on, to rob our wealth of India this way
@WhiteHouse India is a non-religious country, hence no favor can be made for foreign nationals for their religious background, for any visa
@WhiteHouse Indian tax payers pay hefty subsidy for people below poverty,pay salaries to government,invest in infrastructure to build nation
@WhiteHouse and it means, no foreigner can be regarded as an Indian citizen,since the dictatorship is established in India by the foreigners
@WhiteHouse only those kids of an illegal immigrant,took birth on soil of India with at least one parent Indian citizen,can have citizenship
@WhiteHouse what measures US has adopted to help the Indian citizens,if foreign governments handling these foreign fighters may offend here?
@WhiteHouse im myself looks like trapped here, along with local civilians. so i need my US passport and ticket to Indiana soon. thanks
@WhiteHouse US must offer short stay visas for those Indian civilians, who are kept under threats by these infiltrators,the foreign fighters
@WhiteHouse as,how unarmed Indian civilians will face those spies/goon/fighters, who may come to support these spies of Pakistan+Bangladesh?
@WhiteHouse no further people movement or trade be allowed to the Indian international borders, until we may have a fair democratic election
@WhiteHouse seeing the serious threats these people have imposed, we want Indian borders,including water border, to be in full control of US
@WhiteHouse in behalf of people of India, i demand at least 200,000 US-UN military personnel for India, to the period of time we need
@WhiteHouse and im threatened that it may result in collapse of rupees, high inflation, per capita income may be halve within a year
@WhiteHouse we may have trade for only food products during dictatorship on a country, but will it be enough to help civilians of India?
@WhiteHouse has US prepared trade/economic/military/diplomatic sanctions on India, nation, until these people are put in custody or killed?
@WhiteHouse i always advise to help Pakistan in Pakistan, help Bangladesh in Bangladesh, as compare to keeping them under hope in India....
@WhiteHouse bodies of a big number of Indian government security-military personnel are occupied by foreign souls, under a conspiracy
@WhiteHouse US-UK might be knowing, what's going on in India for last 20-25 years and how will this all end up? you know what you doing?
@WhiteHouse there might be strategies to put control over these foreign nationals,occupying govt-political positions of India from back door
@WhiteHouse it's foolish to think that CIA wasn't informed about these foreign born President-Prime Minister of India. you allowed them...
@WhiteHouse all those who are in power, got these key positions under "commonwealth recruitment",while hiding their true identity for years
@WhiteHouse and as they all were put on these key government positions by US/UK itself, what strategy you have to kill them in tough times?
@WhiteHouse has US/UN put enough military personnel to defend the common Indian civilians, if we are offended by these foreign spies?
@WhiteHouse as they now know all the key Internal Security Information, while threatening common civilians, hence having terrorizing we all
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals occupying government-political positions after deceiving "security checks" are well qualified as terrorists
@WhiteHouse they deceived common people every time they went to ask for vote. foreigners having police/govt jobs while hiding true identity
@WhiteHouse this "target killing" casualties might be in a big number as these things continued under a conspiracy for many years
@WhiteHouse i know im kept safe for many years and i also know that many like me participating on these political talks couldn't be defended
@WhiteHouse mainly women are trapped/kidnapped/raped and then quitely murdered too,by taking out soul of their bodies by using foreign souls
@WhiteHouse common civilians doing political talks are being 'quietly' killed in a "target killing" way, a mass killing was done for years
@WhiteHouse US+UK are responsible to state the measures they adopted to stop attacks on those civilians,who just participated in these talks
@WhiteHouse Fatal attacks on Indian civilians were done in Hitler's Nazi way,by taking out soul of their bodies 'quietly',under a conspiracy
@WhiteHouse False ID terrorists of Bangladesh+Pak on government-political positions have also killed many civilians, who could resist them
@WhiteHouse US/UK must be responsible for any acts of these False ID terrorists on government-political positions,hence threats to civilians
@WhiteHouse US/UK must always be ready to straight kill those, who can't be put in custody easily, having occupied enough strengths to date
@WhiteHouse & death penalty for those who occupied government-political positions of India while deceiving "security checks" for these jobs
@WhiteHouse i favor upto 5 years of refugee visas for illegal migrants doing usual jobs, if their embassy issue passport and criminal checks
@WhiteHouse and Yes, refugee visas are generally regarded as the "Pathway" to citizenship, as we see in US/UK/Australia
@WhiteHouse i would like to see little shame on UK/Aus and take these illegals to their own country, during the period their men were active
@WhiteHouse why would India,largest democratic country, allow these people,if it doesn't have any open immigration?already overly populated?
@WhiteHouse even for local usual jobs, whoever enter into India, take a job of local Indians,with a pool of high qualified professionals too
@WhiteHouse as helped by their spies occupying on government positions of India, to finally de-establish India, a conspiracy of many years
@WhiteHouse Nationals of enemy background countries, Pakistan+Bangladesh, have entered here in a big number under a False Indian IDs,
@WhiteHouse these nationals of Pakistan+Bangladesh bully and represent minority Muslim community of India also, to fuel Sectarian War here
@WhiteHouse the religious unity of India, which these foreign spies are actively destroying, their open statements confirms the same
@WhiteHouse religious background of local civilians is an internal issue, which require 'religious unity' within the country
@WhiteHouse with having a control over defense of India, a nuclear power??? do we have any action plan to take nukes of India under control?
@WhiteHouse these foreign spies, having terrorized the civilians of India, aren't qualified as honest or dishonest person, as they are spies
@WhiteHouse as they know key internal security information, while working for foreign governments, which is a serious threats to civilians
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals on government-political positions, while hiding true identity, are well compared to him http://images.indiatvnews.com/mainnational/IndiaTve44a19_kasab.jpg …
@WhiteHouse no one come from these 2 rogue nations as Pakistani Muzahidin or Bangladeshi Muzahidin, with Hindu Type red stings on hands also
@WhiteHouse and similarly Pakistani+Bangladeshi nationals are brought here by Commonwealth Recruitment,to fight in India as "Indian" Muslims
@WhiteHouse and with Hindu type red stings on hands too, he was part of a conspiracy, as discussed in this news
@WhiteHouse Kasab, as an "Indian" Muzahidin,killed 100s on a local station just to fuel religious riots in India,even if they had key hotels
@WhiteHouse we have experience of "Indian" Muzahidin like Azmal Kasab coming from Pakistan+Bangladesh. its the same case for their spies too
@WhiteHouse nationals of Bangladesh+Pakistan are hiding among Indian Muslims under False IDs,under a conspiracy, by Commonwealth Recruitment
@WhiteHouse & after crossing international border of India with a False Indian ID, while hiding their true identity, they are "infiltrators"
@WhiteHouse we need only 'passport', issued by a country, to enter into another country, where a person is identified by his/her nationality
@WhiteHouse no passport of world is issued for Christians/Hindus/Muslims, hence no-one can enter India because of their religious background
