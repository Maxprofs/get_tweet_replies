@BarackObama I signed it, but it's a little slimey to kick me straight over to the donation page after. I shouldn't need to pay to support.
@AngieDrue can't imagine how you could say that net neutrality will lead to losing free speech...
@AngieDrue smart women
@AngieDrue @septembercindy
@BarackObama another lie! This is for him to control our internet. No free speech. Google! And wake the beep up!
@BarackObama @ddc0660 @AngieDrue If the internet goes free, it will have to be tax payer funded.If tax payer funded,regulation will increase
@turn_informed @BarackObama @AngieDrue As opposed 2 how net neutrality rules cost biz (ie Netflix) more $ which gets passed on to taxpayers?
