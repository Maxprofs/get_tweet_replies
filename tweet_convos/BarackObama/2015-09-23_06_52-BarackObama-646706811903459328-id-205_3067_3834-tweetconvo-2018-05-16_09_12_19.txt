Yes.  Immigrants who came here legally.  Remember Ellis Island Father? @WhiteHouse @pontifex 
#LearnOurHistory please
@noprezzie2012 wouldn't all illegal immigrants be here legally if there was an Ellis Island today? Don't just LEARN history, understand it.
No. Some would be sent home...like they were then.  At the very least they would be screened for contagious diseases. @JaxStoccatto
@noprezzie2012 my point was that immigrants had at least a fighting chance of getting in then.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex A man of Peace will find it difficult to be welcomed by the Republican war mongers and their minions.
@WhiteHouse @Pontifex The President welcomes a man who seeks a better world for all, and Republicans invited the warmonger Bibi.

@mymolly01 So you joined twitter just to say some racist, ignorant shit? Fuck out of here. Learn history, fool.
@mymolly01 You and I wouldn't be sitting in the same America right now, and capitalism wouldn't exist as it does...
I have no idea what you are talking about. I love America. I believe someone abused my twitter so I am changing it.
