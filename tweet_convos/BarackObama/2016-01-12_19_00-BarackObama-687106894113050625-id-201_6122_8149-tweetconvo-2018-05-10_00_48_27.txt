@Elftacular @BarackObama don't be a jerk
@BarackObama but you race bait all the time Bro. . . Something about a pot calling a kettle something
@BarackObama ,
Thank you.
@BarackObama we need to reject people that want to come here and kill US citizens.
@cainfam22 @BarackObama I agree with that but, if America is doing the same to her people, then what's the differnce?
@bosio88 @BarackObama the difference is we don't have to have them here. Americans are already here
@BarackObama. I wonder if the GOP presidential candidates are living in a different world in this regard

@BarackObama Thank you Mr. President. I haven't put a picture of a politician in my home since, Pres. Kennedy. History will tell...Blessings
@BarackObama U forgot to mention muslim Islamic Terrorists targeting US citizens, Boston, San Beradino, Ft Hood etc tell them to stop
@nunyabus1 @BarackObama that's like telling america to stop.
@BarackObama Not all religions are created equal. If Buddha preach to kill the infidels or apostates, Buddhism would be far more violent.
@BarackObama I must admit,I am so honored and I feel so blessed to have lived in a time & a great place  where @BarackObama is a President
@anamaria_peru @AmineAyara @BarackObama should ask WTF is wrong with you
@BarackObama Mr. President sir, why were you silent when the Nigerian Army brutally killed 1000+ Shia Muslims in Zaria, #Nigerian?
@ELBINAWI @BarackObama no disrespect but, you guys need to defend yourselves it's your country, obama or america owes you nothing,
@BarackObama that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights @POTUS
even in the Holy Scriptures (KJV 1611) states the same, but America has excluded a certain race of people to have been give the same (even if God rightfully gave them).
“@BarackObama: "We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion." —President Obama #SOTU”
@BarackObama I'm sorry to say but racial discrimination is far from gone from the American culture. As a Mexican I experience it everyday.
We miss you sir! Thank you
@BarackObama true
@BarackObama @mell_olivia ...just one small issue, the same must be said of gender.
@BarackObama Mr . president deeply touched by your speech. You have spoken for the people of this world, today and tommorow.
@BarackObama amen, "Don't Believe Hype America" Trump is trouble maker
@BarackObama your State of the Union speech was needed to show the younger generations a hopeful future. Thank you!
@BarackObama mr. President your former Muslim correct? Why don't we talk about the prophet Muhammad and the things he did while on earth?
