@WhiteHouse The bunch of dunces think that carbon dioxide is a pollutant.
@Carbongate @WhiteHouse deforestation + oversaturated ocean + increased production of CO2 emissions = bad news
@Irishrock724 @WhiteHouse No = your bullshit!
@Carbongate @WhiteHouse 98% of scientists are on my side. You're with nut jobs.
@Irishrock724 @WhiteHouse Oh no they are not! and I'm with the scientific logic. Temperature increases CO2 and the Sun drives climate.
@Carbongate @WhiteHouse Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
@Irishrock724 @WhiteHouse More bullshit!
@Carbongate @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
