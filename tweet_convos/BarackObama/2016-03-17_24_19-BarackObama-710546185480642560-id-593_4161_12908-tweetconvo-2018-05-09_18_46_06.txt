@BarackObama So the Constitutional Professor and attorney actually knows the Constitution, Imagine that Republicans.. DO YOUR JOBS!!!
@diamondofblack @BarackObama He wa not a Const. Prof. That's a lie. And they are doing their job. There is no timeline. Dems advocated same
@KiloMick @BarackObama He wa? Doing there Job like trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act 50+ times and nothing to replace it..Great Job
@diamondofblack @BarackObama Not a Constitutional Professor. They are doing their job. Opposing him. That's why they elected in landslide.
@KiloMick @BarackObama their job is to pass laws and work with the President on behalf of the people not obstruct, He did win by 9 million
@diamondofblack @BarackObama if you think the opposition party is there to "work with" the President,you severely misunderstand our founding
@KiloMick @BarackObama you Sir have a misunderstanding of how a government should work you're stuck in that time l have no sympathy for you
@diamondofblack @BarackObama No. Sorry, but you're wrong. So incredibly wrong it's laughable. Try reading on the subject a bit. Later
@BarackObama With all due respect Mr. President, I would have expected a more ethnic nominee, perhaps a black female, never appointed before
@BarackObama However, I hope you veto a bill Congress has in committee if passed, that would make magic an art form, eligible for fed grants
@BarackObama Such a bill as that, would spend too much money & would spur inflation harmful to the nation. What a waste of taxpayer money!
@BarackObama Racial minorities in Los Angeles & elsewhere are treated unfairly by the criminal justice system.
@BarackObama With any upcoming battles with Congress over gun control, etc., will criminal justice reform be another of your key decisions?
@BarackObama Or was it an unconscious effort on those acronym agencies part to control writers with an effect that mirrored intimidation.
@BarackObama The acronym agencies (alphabet) that you can't mention, monitored the activities of hundreds of U.S. writers, including me.
@BarackObama I'm a decorated former federal employee & have done nothing but good for this country?  Intellectual properties anybody?
@BarackObama Fire all they asses and re hire !!
@Kim__Barbie @BarackObama That's not how this works.
@KiloMick @BarackObama That's how it should work
@Kim__Barbie @BarackObama Yay totalitarianism!!! You didn't do well in history class, did you?
@KiloMick @BarackObama I thought the President was in control along with the people .hmm I guess not
@Kim__Barbie @BarackObama He's not a King. People voted in a landslide for R senate and House.They confirm. Checks and balances. Open a book
@BarackObama What are your thoughts on QPR's chances of making the play offs??
no. He's so rude
Heaven forbid!
@BarackObama @vden2  Amen
@BarackObama However, it is difficult to predict how an individual will rule on sensitive issues once he/she becomes a member of the Court.
@BarackObama To be honest Mr. President, the system of checks & balances results in the "President vs Congress." It is designed for inaction
@BarackObama اوباما لابد من الاعتذار لأسيادك
@o__22 @BarackObama  العكس كذالك
@ffbvcxxx @o__22 @BarackObama ?
@BarackObama you have to be one of the smartest presidents we ever have. Keep pushing to the end. No lame duck here
after all you put up with. At every turn the GOP blocked you. Now this. I'm sorry for you and your legacy. Anyone else but him
@BarackObama his idea of qualified is his opinion. The Senate decides, not him.
@mbcampbell111 @barackobama Actually, according to the constitution, the President decides, the Senate just agrees or disagrees.
@BalazsVagvolgyi @BarackObama and he can't do anything until they agree (my point, or do you need to be technically correct?)
@mbcampbell111 @barackobama That means they both decide then as they need to agree. (Except in case of a recess appointment.)
@BarackObama Its not their duty.
@AndersByttner huh? It is the Senate's duty to vote yes or no on a nominee.
@BarackObama you are an exceptional leader, the world needs someone like you.. you'll be missed!!
@Krazy_iDeas @BarackObama yes, he is, he was and he always been. I love Barack Obama

@BarackObama Except you don't follow the constitution.
@BarackObama 然而沒什麼用處，黑人種族歧視一樣日益嚴重

@BarackObama I want to thank our President for putting the rights of women and the rights of LGBT couples first w/ his SCOTUS nomination.
@BarackObama  You do YOUR job instead of Golf and vacays for your family. What are you teaching your children? Live off the govt?
@BarackObama YES, he did, I would have preferred him to nominate a well qualified black woman.
@BarackObama now he wants to follow the constitution
@BarackObama there is a first time for everything.
@BarackObama THE SOLUTION: Disagree with Obama but Respect judge Garland. Hear what the judge has to say then say no if you want to. Peace
@BarackObama Whatever.
@BarackObama goot
@BarackObama President Obama took his constitutional duty seriously and nominated a well qualified  white man in attempt to show Congress

@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton @SenTedCruz I can't believe that President Obama complimented himself on SCOTUS. So pompous!
@BarackObama yep. ignore you like youve done to them the whole second term.
@BarackObama They are doing their job.  Apparently you have not read the constitution. #check #balanceofpower #fail #yournotking #wetheppl
@BarackObama ...great
@BarackObama ... Let's hope... Tell them my taxes are paying for them to work and not stall
@BarackObama Now you want us to believe you have some sense of constitutional duty because it serves your personal agenda? #DoYourJob
@BarackObama You were derelict in your constitutional duties when you shielded so called "dreamers" from immigration laws. #DoYourJob
@BarackObama Offers good fun day. Hope you're happy about. <3 <3 (y) (y)
@BarackObama You were derelict in your constitutional duties when you refused to protect Kim Davis from judicial persecution. #DoYourJob
@BarackObama You were derelict in your constitutional duty when you refused to defend valid law; i.e., DOMA.
@BarackObama Ha!!! That's the first time he has 'invoked' the constitution ... but, of course, for his benefit.
@BarackObama idiot GOP favored this nominee years ago, as well-qualified and a good choice at that time, keep your hypocrisy straight boys
@BarackObama  I have been self employed for 15 years and I have never had it so bad since you took office
@BarackObama don't talk in 3rd person on social media.
@BarackObama way to nominate the most conservative judge ever nominated by a democrat that'll really show the republicans good job
@BarackObama way to go Mr. President
@BarackObama 
Typical lefty. Not exactly the peoples' choice. Your priorities ---March madness and pop culture--say it all.
@BarackObama Should we puke now or later Constitution destroyer?! Quit ur BULLYING! At least some of them know their job unlike you. GO GOLF
@BarackObama seriously the nomination is made as a political pawn in the heated election !!! Just chill
@BarackObama I doubt that. If you want to see a man that stands up for the constitution take a good long hard look at @tedcruz
@BarackObama And now the Senate can follow his lead from Alito; and filibuster and vote against cloture. Or is that bad NOW, but not then?
@BarackObama Well qualified for you to try and stop the 2nd Amendment. Not fooling anyone.
@BarackObama That's a flat out lie - there is no constitutional duty for the Congress to vet your candidate. Most hypocritical of you.
@BarackObama They did....they told you to take a hike.
