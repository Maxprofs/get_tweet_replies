@BarackObama Mr.President I pray the court will uphold the Medical Care Act for the benefit of so many of our citizens.
@BarackObama thanks Obama psh
@BarackObama
@gjjcsjkfd @BarackObama hi
@BarackObama, so in other words, it's not about ensuring people have affordable healthcare. It's about your bottom line. Good to know.
@BarackObama  barak o boma
@BarackObama it will rise by more than $137 billion if it is not repealed. Tell both sides of the story!
@BarackObama Talk of removing Obamacare is just GOP hyperbole.  We want to keep the ACA wholly intact.
@BarackObama Lies!
@BarackObama and my cholesterol will go back to like 500 without the meds.
@Donnavox @BarackObama No kidding! 
@Rosatigal @BarackObama I  am genetically blessed with stupidly high cholesterol, even when skinny. Yay me.
@Donnavox @BarackObama You & me, both. Fine right now but they repeal my BP #'s will go through the roof from anxiety over premiums!
@BarackObama 
The affordable care great for the country- it is health care inclusive. It should &must stay for more inclusiveness.

@BarackObama now more jobs will leave USA w/new trade agreement. Enough is enough
A drop in the $8 TRILLION bucket you're saddling our kids and grand-kids with. But hey, "It's the GOP's fault!" Right? Putz. @BarackObama
@BarackObama    I think I know why people want to bang u.
@BarackObama help me 03443900821

@king_abbott @BarackObama You are going to sell us out. Inverted Totalitarianism wins.
@BarackObama This coming from the same guy who said "if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor".  A little bit of a credibility gap.
@BarackObama more lies, or scare tactics?
@BarackObama Debt is now 18 trillion under you.
@BarackObama  Buhari killing @biafra land  Calaber
@BarackObama Bold words from the jackass that accumulated more debt than ALL PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM. How do they let u get away w/these lies?
@BarackObama this sounds like a threat
@BarackObama It will go up 3X as much if it isn't.
@BarackObama hey intern. It's worth it. Stop it from growing to 25 trillion in 10 yrs. you do know it's 18 trillion now right? #clueless
@BarackObama Healthcare at my job went up last year (after O-care made health insurance a must) and this year too-what about MY debt?
@BarackObama Didn't you waste nearly a trillion on obamacare?
@BarackObama https://youtu.be/DRz_99McMts  Mhoni have fantastic predictions of the next president of incredible USA @mhonividente @NBCNews @nypost
@BarackObama lmao..Didn't you hold back some #taxpayer money somewhere? #Gruber told you too! #RepealObamaCare #SCOTUS #WakeUpAmerica #tcot
.@BarackObama because RINOs like Boehner/McConnell will fund Obamacare
@BarackObama: CHUMP CHANGE, compared with what YOU'VE done the nat'l debt.
@BarackObama and if we lower tax rates federal revenues would increase
@BarackObama I don't believe you - AT ALL - but just for grins I'll admit ditching O'care would be cheap at twice that price!
@BarackObama Hmmmmm....
I suspect you're lying again.
@BarackObama dumbass
@BarackObama coming from you? So what?
@BarackObama get medical costs under control = #problemsolved
@BarackObama Brought to you by the people that claimed that passing Obamacare would reduce your insurance rates. Notice weasel word 'could'
@BarackObama After what SCOTUS did to the American people's right to vote the scales of justice do not balance, government for sale, tyranny
@BarackObama New small business owners, empowered with new insurance, would get hurt most. This law freed them to try
@BarackObama You worried a bout billions $$$ now brah? You are the trillions $$$ Prez. congrats!
@BarackObama no one believes a liar that makes up fake numbers.
@BarackObama @seanhannity @greggutfeld @TomiLahren Another factless Lie pulled out his rear. Show us Calculations.
@BarackObama  I think you need lots of math lessons because you can't add 2+2 and believe it, or, not, the feds can't keep printing money 4U
@BarackObama and Healthcare would be better. Obama care is a sham
@BarackObama #educate yourself and #WhiteHouse #reschedule #medicalcannabis #Medicalmarijuana  stop the suffering of Americans
@BarackObama That's another lie. Please stop.
@BarackObama Please stop. It's questionable data, and we don't know what will happen. Stop scaremongering.
@BarackObama AvMed customer for many years, In last year it suddenly is a hard time about any test doc orders. They want Obamacare to fail.
@BarackObama That's why GOP wants to kill it: so debt cld increase & they can say the ACA increased the debt. 'Cause that makes sense. NOT.
@BarackObama $137 billion won't even register next to your debt additions in the TRILLIONS. #StopScammingAmerica
@BarackObama You must do well!!
@BarackObama u are one of the worst presidents we have ever had!!!!!
@BarackObama you know a lot about increasing the debt. Obama are is a farce!!!!!

@BarackObama : BUHARI has started killing Biafrans again as he did in1967-1970
@BarackObama It will be very expensive to clean up the mess that has been created since 2008,The fault of both sides
@BarackObama  You're not really trying to convince us that you care about the national debt, are you?  Because that would be … ridiculous.
@BarackObama @ComedyCentral @ComedyFeatured. This guy is a comedian. Hilarious #POTUS
@BarackObama A BARGAIN if it gets rid of that pathetic law! Meanwhile, what did your #Obamacare website cost?  And is it finished yet?!?
