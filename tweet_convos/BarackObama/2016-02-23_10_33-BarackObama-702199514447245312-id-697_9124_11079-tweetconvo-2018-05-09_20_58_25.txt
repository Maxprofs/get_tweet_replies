@BarackObama Not gonna happen. Go on vacation.
@LibertyNews Obviously Senate already has. McConnell will cave. Abrogation of constitutional duty.
@Conservative4MI @LibertyNews It says they are to advise and consent. There is no timetable but to ask POTUS not to nom is ridiculous.
@Conservative4MI @LA_Denizen @LibertyNews Actually they did ask him not to nominate. It was pretty big news when they did.
@Conservative4MI @KevinAnsel @LA_Denizen @LibertyNews
@BarackObama @Conservative4MI ya win an election until then gop runs the senate
@Conservative4MI But at least there were actual hearings and Alito got voted on. Current GOP statement is no hearing even.
@BarackObama @GreatDismal I'm pretty sure they can't delay if you haven't nominated anyone yet. They are all talk right now.
@Conservative4MI @BarackObama @GreatDismal No idea what you're referring to.
@Conservative4MI no worries
@BarackObama Says the #POTUS who #filibustered #Alito.  #Hypocrisy much #OBama ?
@johnberg @BarackObama Filibusters are part of the process. Refusing to do your constitutional duty is destructive. You should know this.
@zionford @BarackObama No, the Senate is allowed to set it's own rules under the Constitution.
@johnberg @BarackObama The Senate is supposed to work for the people for the benefit of the people. government for the people not in reverse
@zionford Right, and the people don't want an Obama nominee on Supreme Court.  If Dems want different then elect more Dem senators.
@johnberg I am one of those people The last time I looked. I want him to do his job. Only the Republicans don't want him to do it. Thats Sad
@BarackObama @Eivanoff1 fuck Obama he belongs in jail
@BarackObama: YES!
@BarackObama They have refused to do their job for 7 years of your presidency! Enough is enough! #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @cwaltershausen And everyone thinks Hillary will be able to get things done with the same assholes I don't think so.
@BarackObama no let them stall i dont want your pick in the scotus! so much for being a liberal or progressive! all theater of the absurd
@BarackObama you are the epitome of all that is right with this country. Thank you...
@BarackObama #
@BarackObama u r a king, love ya
@BarackObama 
#people Mr.Obama is still our president wake up , or grow up!!!
@BarackObama All Lives Matter
@BarackObama well, what are you waiting for?
. You. Are. And always. Be our best president. We ever. Had.....besides Lincoln
@BarackObama Yes, Congress, #DoYourJob ! Obama has 4 terms, not 3!
@BarackObama The people who say Obama "Failed" are either stupid or have some self interest. It's easier to say than to do the Job.
@BarackObama you claimed otherwise when you were a Senator in 08
@BarackObama Agreed, but that clock doesn't start ticking until you name a Nominee. What's the hold up?
@BarackObama YES! Please don't do anything nothing for the next 300 days you fucked up enough shit
@MccRwt1 @BarackObama just remember the shit that Bush left...
@BarackObama do your  job  like  the  rest  of  us or be FIRED
@BarackObama Dig a hole and crow in it ,I don't want ever see you again !!!
@BarackObama Disappear
@BarackObama I am so worried that Donald Trump may become President, aren't you?
@BarackObama I can't agree with that more! WE Elected you!
@BarackObama bro you're one president the world won't forget for the great things you done you're my hero.
@BarackObama Mr President, you do your job! Represent ALL of the people!
@BarackObama the other's were submitted by a real President! Counting the days untill you're gone!
@BarackObama @bells110 You have right to nominate. They have right to reject. Longest vacancy in SC 363 days (1970) #AcceptYourJob
@Gdsblssd1 @BarackObama As the poet says: Yes I have reasons for shame but I have not committed treason and sullied my good name #hamiltunes
@BarackObama do your Job...Nominate a Justice,  The people voted you in TWICE to do just that! Do your Job President Obama!!!
@BarackObama good  jib.
@BarackObama @Mark_Sheppard
The King of Hell always keep his terms of the contract. 
AAPES
@BarackObama Let's see 125 days..NO.  250 days.... NO ...No vote for another 125 days... OK THat works out! #Trump2016
@BarackObama I don't like you but the fact they vowed to block anyone you nominated before you nominated is pretty stupid.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself Damn Skippy! Give 'em hell, Sir!!
@BarackObama senate is repres of rebulican candidates! We need u Ob don't let their hate stop wats right.
@BarackObama I'm republican but I have to agree with Barack here. Do your job and don't wait for a new president
@BarackObama 
Hypocrite.
@BarackObama  they do stuff but you just veto it and make all the executive orders you want
@BarackObama ,  damn freakin Republicans stop hating and start doing your job.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself Senate isn't obligated to approve a nom. that will change the balance of the Court, esp. w/liberal lower courts.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself by that logic, obama would have never been elected president.
@BarackObama Of course it has an excuse. Each party's principals are at stake here. I would be amazed if there WASN'T a fight!
@BarackObama I don't like Obama, but he can nominate anyone. It's not fair and the Republicans don't have to accept who he picks. #DoYourJob
@HamillHimself I'm a conservative and I agree with this - even if @BarackObama tried to pull the same thing himself in his Senate days. LOL
@BarackObama @HamillHimself Totally agree with this #insulting
@BarackObama @HamillHimself as long as you're somewhat willing to compromise on his left-wingedness
@BarackObama Happy to support this if you can reduce the  National deficit by 1.9 trillion.in the same time period. Surely 1% is a cakewalk.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself about time people put their differences aside & get something done. it's called "public service" for a reason
@BarackObama @HamillHimself #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @HamillHimself Yes. Please tell them. We're ready! #EPVIII
@BarackObama @HamillHimself should've been a better Prez. Then he'd have his majority still. People voted checks and balances...deal
@BarackObama @HamillHimself if you put up a viable nominee..then there is no sane reason they shouldn't do their job.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself Biden in 1992: Wait until after election to nominate a Supreme Court justice http://wapo.st/1PTfRdm 
@BarackObama no way! You have to be stopped at every turn.
@BarackObama no excuse for this country being in the shape its in.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself You didn't when you were in the senate.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself NO congress should not vote.  Next President should decide.
@BarackObama @HamillHimself 
Still 300days with all the campaigning that has been done
I'm exhausted hearing about it & I'm in #Aust. 
@BarackObama @HamillHimself the Democrats delayed George Bush when it was even earlier in his term. But double standard, I guess?
@BarackObama @SensiblySecular #DoYourJob
@BarackObama you're right. No time to play games means to counter your every action.
@BarackObama it's disgraceful the behavior of GOP senators.they need a beginner's history lesson
@BarackObama @HIGH_GREEN_44 Need to Know!
@BarackObama  dnell1955@ I do believe you have done a wonderful job.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama you tell them, sir. Don't let them off the hook.
@BarackObama @BerniesHomie Nothing but obstructionism!
@BarackObama,
@BarackObama Last time I checked we were a republic with freedom of religion and speech AND separate powers If america loses that I'll leave
@BarackObama bascily what they're saying is @POTUS is only in charge of the executive branch, any overlap results in dictatorships #Congress
@BarackObama 
Senate you need to #doyourjob atleast once #realthugsinSenate
@BarackObama they've had no excuse for any number of questionable crap they've pulled during your administration, but they changed zip
@BarackObama @ElizabethBanks They will be mocking the very constitution they swore to up hold if they don't confirm #dotheirjobs
@BarackObama @dsfpspacefl1ght One can only hope such idiotic antics will sour the people on the "GOP" and turn the toward sanity (Democrats)
@BarackObama @ElizabethBanks POTUS has failed to nominate anybody, so why the countdown? Tell me again, who's not doing their job? BS charge
@BarackObama @kerrywashington I think we should suspend their pay until the #Senate does their job. #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @motherunit420 "We don't like you" is apparently the only excuse those pinheads need. (I know--not nice.)
@BarackObama @ElizabethBanks Exactly, voters should really take plenty of time, since several have already turned coats!
@BarackObama Several Supremes have turned coats!
@BarackObama every president has attended supreme Court funerals,  Barack changed that,  so let's  change how long it takes,  400+days.
@BarackObama @ElizabethBanks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVvxGa0zhWo …
@BarackObama the #GOP that WILL be coming in to replace you doesn't want one of your picks. Can't blame them.
@BarackObama @kerrywashington Mr President you can do it! I have faith in you or else I wouldn't have voted for in for 2 terms
@BarackObama God bless you sir! Put these obstructionists in their place! We've got your back!!!
@BarackObama Talk to your veep, he can explain.
@BarackObama @kerrywashington I have never seen so much hate spewing out of that senate room like I've seen during past 7 or so yrs.
@BarackObama @ElizabethBanks ISIS do YOUR job !
@BarackObama Support at @berniesanders for me seeing I supported you 8 years unconditionally. Got in fist fights over you. Cheers. 
@BarackObama @kerrywashington thank god
@barackobama If only there was a way for you to be able to run for a third term let's hope Mrs.Hillary wins
@BarackObama got to love the irony of you telling anyone to do their job. Enforcing immigration law is your job. Do it.
@BarackObama Your VP --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVvxGa0zhWo …
@BarackObama if your criteria  for a justice wasn't so Bogus
@BarackObama They should all go to prison for obstructionism #DoYourJob
@BarackObama go to sleep
@BarackObama @Knit_n_scribble https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPAzVNmOYgM …
@LisaCinFL decades ago, after many, many years of SCOTUS controlling our lives and our politics, time for a change
@Knit_n_scribble I agree completely. Just disgusted with hypocrisy on both sides when a position suddenly benefits them politically.
@LisaCinFL I know, why can't they just make our government work like it's supposed to.

@BarackObama vv
@BarackObama good night all to you in Twitter .Pray to all health day n you family.Thanks so much to all my friends
@BarackObama Congress has been delaying important legislation for years. We the people need this to stop.
@BarackObama 
The PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF TREASONOUS ACTS. EVERY
APPOINTMENT OBAMA HAS MADE HAS BEEN AN ENEMY OF THE STATES.
DAMAGE CONTROL
@BarackObama @BerniesHomie Be prepared to make this stand w/our president. Once he announces - we constantly FLOOD our state reps w/demands!
@BarackObama  #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @TN4BERNIE Our fault for electing a majority of Republican congress people, right? Gotta give a Pres a decent congress!
@BarackObama @TN4BERNIE Maybe Bernie will get to have 8 years within which to appoint his Supreme Court nominees.That would serve them right
@BarackObama @TN4BERNIE You can bring a horse to water, but can't make them drink!
@BarackObama you do your job instead of blaming other people
@BarackObama better hurry! Only 300 more days for tax payer vacations! The country is actually better off when you are on the links
@BarackObama Senate, Grow a spine & BLOCK ALL nominees!
@BarackObama and if the senate wants to shut down; they shouldn't get paid. #DoYourJob
@BarackObama Such grace under pressure. God help you in these next few months.
@BarackObama WTF?  Why are you kissing Republican ass on @Scotus
@BarackObama @DaleRominger not true. In the 1890's there were nominee's that were held up for over 300 days
@BarackObama I really ask the #senate to do your job, because I believe so much obstruction is treason.
@BarackObama keep pushing sir!
@BarackObama  You tell them #DoYourJob
@BarackObama A SCOTUS recess appointment NOW is a proportional counter to a schizophrenic GOP and Trump nomination. Seal your legacy NOW Sir
@BarackObama Presidents get to pick.  He's the president. I voted for his choice. Best.President.You.Never.Appreciated.
@barackobama @sweetangelface They better get this done before summer!
@BarackObama We are behind you all the way!
@BarackObama Glad to see you are willing to earn your paycheck and benefits.
@BarackObama I agree Mr. President!
@BarackObama @darth #DoYourJob Why is Robert Bork missing?
@BarackObama since when do the republicans hold you back from doing what you want?
@BarackObama if the play political games they lose my vote come November
@BarackObama how about you #DoYourJob and not avoid the constitution
@BarackObama -Mr. President, make sure they do their jobs!!
@BarackObama  It is always a first time for disruption... Present the nominee and watch the political system at work. Maybe is not that bad.
@BarackObama you do your job honor the constitution
@BarackObama @Noland_nyc Nominate someone.
So you nominated somebody? MT "@BarackObama: W/ > 300 days left in President Obama's term, the Senate has no excuse to delay. #DoYourJob
@BarackObama We are with you!
@BarackObama @KellyAyotte #DoYourJob #KellyAyotte
@BarackObama @TomCinmidlife Dear Mr President, people of humble ambitions need to be taught the principles that are violated by RW Senators.
@BarackObama @PatToomey #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @TheAgentPro @ERIKA_N_TONY I'd would miss this president 
@BarackObama keep up the great work you do and you are doing a fine job

@BarackObama THANK YOU!
@BarackObama NM&MLK-MTRIP. A WORD TO WISE POTUSes: Future SCOTUS selections, to include a realistic weight estimate, of NMT 180 lbs @ age 70
@BarackObama the senate n republicans r disgusting  would u please run 4 3 rd term!
@BarackObama Thank You, you are the Best President Ever.
@BarackObama #doyourjob #heckyeah
@BarackObama  Thank you
@BarackObama Nominating a Republican? How pathetic! A Republican would never even consider this. Such learned helplessness. So disappointing
#LameDucks shouldn't quack.  @BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama do your job
@BarackObama Clearly, you know NOTHING of the history of SCOTUS nominations and the process. Put on your big boy pants & suck it up.
@BarackObama Amen Mr. President!
@BarackObama Obama brought our greatest heart and hope...Bernie sanders will continue that fight without fear...@BernieSanders
@BarackObama what are you asking us to do?
