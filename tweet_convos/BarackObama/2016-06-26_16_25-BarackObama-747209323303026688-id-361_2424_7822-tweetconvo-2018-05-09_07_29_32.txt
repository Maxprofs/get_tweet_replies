how will you tackle the biggest threat to LGBT community: Islam? Their views range from believing it's a sin to death penalty.
So does Christianity.
Yes Christianity is very bad re LGBT but  few are throwing them off buildings. Death is the penalty in 10 muslim  countries.
Indonesia.  Turkey.  Albania.  All Muslim countries.  Homosexuality is legal.
Indonesia's  province of Aceh has a sharia-based anti-homosexuality law that punishes gay sex with 100 lashes.
A state in my own country still has a law that allows murders to escape jail time if they feel threatened by gay people.
that states laws need to be challenged.
Indeed they do!  Point is that LGBTI discrimination isn't an Islamic phenomenon.

Nonsense! Obama didn't "repeal""don't ask, don't tell". It was never a law, merely a decree by President Clinton, so it couldn't be "repealed"It was merely one unconstitutional decree by a President reversing another unconstitutional decree by a Previous President!
