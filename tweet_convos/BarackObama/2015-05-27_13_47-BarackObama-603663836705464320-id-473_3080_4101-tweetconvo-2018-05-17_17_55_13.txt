@BarackObama the 97% agreement is a myth that's been debunked 1,000 times. Please stop lying.. if you can.
@goptraci Please cite reputable sources to bsck your claims... if you can
@admkbldwn And finally, 97 Articles debunking 97% claim:
@goptraci All of those are politically spun commentary articles questioning the *one* study that the 97% number came from
@admkbldwn You are a sheep. Got it.
@goptraci A mindless ad hominem attack. Brilliant.
@admkbldwn obviously she's frustrated. She's absolutely right, this 97% consensus has been debunked, you don't like it.  @goptraci
@ClintDougherty She is frustrated. That's the problem with you right-wingers - 97% emotion, 3% logic.
@BarackObama 97 percent of climate scientists do not, I repeat, DO NOT agree.
@rekenk4mer @BarackObama statistics you have? r u a scientist? whether man produced or not change is inevitable!

@BarackObama @TimBrellow Now lets discuss Obama’s legally binding Oath to protect Constitution, TPP, and Section 3 of the 14th Amendment!!
@BarackObama Most republicans aren't going to believe it until their socks are wet while on the D.C. streets.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama The Tea Party won't believe it until they are treading water.
@BarackObama 97% agree the climate is changing and at least partially caused by man, but there is NO consensus that it is dangerous.
@BarackObama 
#ActOnClimate
@BarackObama Idiot

@BarackObama There is no proof. It is a lie.
@BarackObama Politic is politics! Nothing can be accomplished without positive attitude.

@BarackObama Yawn

@BarackObama thanks for sharing! I've highlighted you on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1M2a2Hw

When 97 percent of climate scientists agree, it's time for the deniers to put politics aside and #ActOnClimate. 
@BarackObama LOL! Agree on what? Govt grant$? Or that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west? 97% of globe laughs at  fake science
@BarackObama if you are stupid enough to think we believe the #anthrax crap was a mistake, you are stupider than you look.

@BarackObama Without Congress can you get the NRC to fast-track licensing of new nuclear plant technology that uses waste as fuel?
@BarackObama The rest of the scientists can make it incorrect. >S< OFA LEADER
@BarackObama Oo.. dekhi kite pani vich na laga jawin 
@BarackObama Definitely--but should include protection of arctic from drilling for oil!
@BarackObama African pride
@BarackObama @LollyParis

@BarackObama "97 percent of climate scientists" is that come from the us or all over the word of the climate scientist?

@BarackObama
@BarackObama @lauramerge and what do you think 97% of climate scientists would say about drilling in the Arctic for oil?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama So now it's "CLIMATE CHANGE". What happened to "GLOBAL WARMING"? Next it'll be "WORLD COOLING". Do U & Gore think we're idiots?
@BarackObama The sir
.@BarackObama #ActOnClimate = don't drill the Arctic or Atlantic; stop all of the above energy policy. Renewables now. Stop #climatechaos
@BarackObama then why are you pushing #TPP that will have detrimental effects on climate? Maybe you should #actonclimate #nofasttrack
#ActOnClimate @BarackObama http://www.oism.org/pproject/  31,000 scientists reject Climate Change http://www.stephankinsella.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/HaydenToJackson.pdf …

@BarackObama @socallks 97 percent of climate scientists bought by government.
@BarackObama How does it feel to keep lying to the American People?
@barackobama @climatedepot unless those 'scientists' are no more relevant than the ones that said Columbus would sail over the world's edge.
@BarackObama @ClimateDepot Soooooo deep. The BS, not the quote.
@BarackObama why did yall quit calling it global warming? Wasn't quite working out for ya was it
@BarackObama @tan123 The man is doing everything he can to line the pockets of the bundlers. Either that or he really is stupid.
@BarackObama 97% of Americans agree you lie!  Please concentrate on something you can control-like ISIS and genocide at their hands!

@BarackObama @tan123 So we can have a nice new shiny carbon tax and live happily ever after
@BarackObama Time for science deniers like yourself to quit pushing a hidden agenda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nbz6966mLc … #StopTheLies
@BarackObama @tan123  When the @POTUS bases policy on fake statistics, the public should be concerned.
@BarackObama @tan123 Climate change happens. No-one on earth says it does not happen. What they are talking about is the UNFCC cefinition.
@BarackObama @tan123 PS, if you are using the Cook et al 97% figure, you are very, very horribly wrong. 64 out of 69 papers ≠ 97% of 11k.
@BarackObama It's time for deniers like yourself to put aside politics and quit lying to people: http://www.climaterealists.org.nz/sites/climaterealists.org.nz/files/Legatesetal13-Aug30-Agnotology%5B1%5D.pdf …

@BarackObama Resilience & pre-deployment of assets.  It's what WE do at our firm. How do private firms get noticed by @fema, USAID etc?
@BarackObama @ThisIsRhiannon I'd call him a moron, but he doesn't really believe in climate change either. Just a tool to screw us with.
@BarackObama so sir plz stop wasting valuable resource on war nd use it for welfare of world

@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Is that the same rhetoric you used when you told Shell to go ahead and drill away in the #Arctic? #keepitintheground
@BarackObama All your tweets are about climate change, and nothing about ISIS. Pathetic excuse of a president I'd say.
@BarackObama the scientist that doctored the findings.that punch numbers in a flawed program those scientist that push the lib agenda
@BarackObama Because its not happening.
@BarackObama where is the oil of tunisia #وينو_البترول
Refusing to admit that climate has changed for 4.5 billion years without human intervention doesn't make it true. @BarackObama @BarryJWoods
@BarackObama so why doesn't the fed stop subsidizing industrial agri w tax $ and leave the economy open for the real stewards, small farmers
@BarackObama As animal agriculture is the largest contribution to climate change (and third world diseases) are you going to do anything?
@BarackObama Also, because you pulled out our forces prematurely with out a residual guard the balance of power in the region was upset!!
@BarackObama seriously? Citing  the bogus 97% study, which has been thoroughly discredited? What is wrong with you? Lying=you're desperate.
@BarackObama Stop flying to fundraisers, golf games, & fancy vacations on Air Force One - MASSIVE Carbon Footprint! #ActOnClimate #hypocrite
@BarackObama time for YOU to put politics aside and stop the rhetoric on this nonsense.
@BarackObama @ScienceguideNL  Then let's act on the advise of these scientists
@BarackObama and if you think fracking is safe, you should live next to a fracking rig. Deniers gonna deny
@BarackObama the earth is not only for human. make some strong act for pollution by human
@BarackObama can't agree more.
@BarackObama @SouBundanga With all respect, sir, allowing Arctic drilling is not going to help fight climate change.
@BarackObama checking
@BarackObama So? 97% percent of scientists used to agree that the Sun revolved around the Earth.

@BarackObama hasn't climate change always existed?  Why is this different?  Things change, always have
@BarackObama Stay strong Mr. President. The "Real People" are behind you! 100%.
@BarackObama 97% is a manufactured number. Good try at shutting down debate though.
@BarackObama it's a good idea but i thing that could be one of your main preoccupation Mr president #Obama not as an option
@BarackObama Never mind having to use 4 billion years of imputation to arrive at an anthropogenic conclusion. Correlation is not causation.
“@BarackObama: When 97 percent of climate scientists agree, it's time for the deniers to put politics aside
@BarackObama RESPECTED  PRESIDENT
WORLD SHOULD UNITE UNDER YOU FOR THESE WORTHY CAUSES WHICH WILL REALLY SAVE THE  WORLD  THE MOTHER EARTH
@BarackObama Good luck with that.
@BarackObama @Karmic_Mishap as if Republicans deny climate change because of science. It's always been about corporate bottom lines, period.
.@BarackObama Ain't a damn thing you can do about universal forces, & earth's climate cycles, save for #Fearmonger for more taxes.
@BarackObama @CarbonMarketIns Who does this cretin think he is? God? The climate is SUPPOSED TO CHANGE! Control Freaks are the real danger!
@BarackObama yes we can \m/
@BarackObama And to stop sending our jobs overseas w/ trade agreements where such laws do not exist or are enforced if they do #ActOnClimate
@BarackObama your 97% has been debunked
@BarackObama Баран обама ,займись своим делом,прекрати войны во всём мире,перестань спонсировать террористов,а климат сам отрегулируется.!!!
@BarackObama My God, Climate Change should NOT be a political issue!! How did that happen?! It's a HUMAN/ENVIRONMENTAL/HEALTH issue!!
@BarackObama don't forget 99 percent of scientists disagreed with Einstein. And were all wrong #TerrorAndErrorByConsensus
@BarackObama SPIRITUALLY
CRUELTY,IMMORTAL CHARACTER
ARE TWO BIGGEST REASON FOR NATURAL CALAMITIES,SO CHANGE NEED TO COME FROM WITHIN
.@BarackObama Please cancel Arctic oil drilling!!! Has our planet not suffered enough?!
It would be easy to put the politics of climate science aside if all the deniers weren't Tea Party Republicans. @barackobama @dana1981
