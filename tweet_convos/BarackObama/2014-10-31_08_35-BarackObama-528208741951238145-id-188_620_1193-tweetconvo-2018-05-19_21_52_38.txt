@BarackObama And I am on the edge of bankruptcy pay for their insurance.
@ZevHadash @BarackObama That's likely not health insurance that's driving you near bankruptcy.
@HarryUnderwood3 @BarackObama it was a good idea, but poorly executed. Change Healthcare cost, not Insurance.
@ZevHadash @BarackObama What about single-payer?
@HarryUnderwood3 @BarackObama also, plans discriminate against LGBT health concerns while forcing unwanted coverage.
@ZevHadash @BarackObama Which plans and who authored these plans?
@HarryUnderwood3 @BarackObama skewed so high they are unreachable. Yet other, more expensive drugs are low tiered.
@ZevHadash @BarackObama Makes sense. But unfortunately, this is the most that we can get due 2 mass ignorance/collusion w/ capitalist health
@ghibid @BarackObama ISIS is occupying Iraq and You should be more concerned about that. Shut up and do something about it.
@ghibid @BarackObama This is a result of the failure of Islam. Islam and free people are incompatible.
@ghibid @BarackObama Mohammed is full of blood. Islam can not govern freedom and liberty.
@ghibid @BarackObama
@BarackObama Sad that fellow Americans getting health insurance is SO distressing to the faux Christian Rs. Jesus is THRILLED though :-)
@MacBethSpeaks @BarackObama it's about how people get insurance. Jesus would not want the Romans to force people to buy insurance.
@dannylasvegas @MacBethSpeaks so Jesus would have wanted the Romans to tax people so they could be forced to buy health insurance?
@dannylasvegas @MacBethSpeaks ACA is about insurance. Jesus loves you Danny.
@BarackObama Peace of mind? you failed at every kind of peace. 
I am LOSING my healthcare thanx to you!
@STOPTHIS @ObamasMentors @BarackObama Get a hold of limp-wrested McConnell. Tell him to get his ass in gear and turn this bucket around.
@BarackObama ..Until after the election when those poor people notice an increase in their premiums and lose their doctors! Liar! #tcot
@BarackObama but what good does it do them when the deductibles are in the thousands
@BarackObama is that really true
@BarackObama except now, trying to get affordable dental for those on Medicare is nearly impossible :-( dental care affects the entire body
@dannylasvegas @BarackObama M plans change every year. This year dental was dropped from many plans. Trying to cover the gap is expensive.
@dannylasvegas no one likes the dentist LOL! But it's essential for complete body wellness.
@dannylasvegas I'm not exactly sure. But those on Medicare are usually on fixed incomes so many outside costs aren't feasible.
@BarackObama And how many  dont have it now?4-5 million because of ridiculously high rates they pay, to pay for the freeloaders. great job
@BarackObama Sir, thanks for getting it done, but now the Supremes might take it away am saddened by this I thought they were impartial
@BarackObama
@BarackObama And Dr. are dropping ALL Medicare and Medicaid patients.I know this, I lost my Dr because of it.
@BarackObama its phony piece of mind when rates are climbing too high to afford it you ignoramus
@BarackObama Sv
@BarackObama I um need the healthcare please can I have a slice
@BarackObama Yes have insurance I was denied for years, but many doctors will not accept my PPO or out of net.  We need to fix this in net!
“@BarackObama: "Ten million Americans have now gained the peace of mind of having health insurance." — President Obama” @reubyp00p

@BarackObama   can you increase the numbers
@BarackObama @NickTheAlexis87 A crock of bull pucky. Those who had it now don't, or have been raised to pay for others. Redistribution.
“@BarackObama: "Ten million Americans have now gained the peace of mind of having health insurance." — President Obama” not true.
@BarackObama paid for by Americans who work, and now have to loose more $ out of our checks because our policies ace doubled
@jklemak @BarackObama This is true. Our insurance policy has doubled and we're getting less coverage. Thanks Obama! 
@BarackObama Ty pres Obama health ins at 40 finally!
