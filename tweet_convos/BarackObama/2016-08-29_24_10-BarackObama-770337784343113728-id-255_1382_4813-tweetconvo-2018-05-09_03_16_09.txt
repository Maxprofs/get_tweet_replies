Judge Garland is not getting in, period, start packing your well off family and go, you did nothing for all of us
@OFA When @HillaryClinton wins, she should go super left with her choice. And she should go ahead and say who now to scare GOP.
Why do those on the Right think HRC is a leftist? Those of us on the Left know she's on the Right. #NEVER
gawd...Jill is the left version of Trump.

she makes Trump look sane, which is not easy for a yam with a toupee.
@OFA no
:Agree. Tankx for respecting the Senate and expecting them to work, write, right ? - wright
it's time to get back to work and leave politics in your home states. Do what's right for America.

@OFA its not too late to charge Hillary
Mr. President why r not taking stringent action against Pakistan for murdering baloch people & supporting terrorism...
End the Republican infestation of Congress! Ride the Blue Wave!
Why? GOP & Dems both serve the 1%.
It might pass for journalism on MTP, but I don't buy the "both-sides-do-it" argument.  There's a difference.
Not enough of a difference to save our environment or our lives
Hii...Obama..
buoy should not appoint any one should the next President,
Hi, Mr President, you are very right, you make a right choice. Mr Gerland, is correct for that post.

he #OBE this is the #Internetage! to get #judyGarland -:) in the supreme court this is the way a #GE and #naturalIlluminati c
would do it; organize a public #internetVote and 1 week later a normal #publicVote in a weeks time you know who has voted by c
internet if correctly done so these dudes can put their printed version of what they voted in the box at the #publicVote c
the publicvote is mainly for persons who don't have internet or PC's and as you are promoting #environmentalism #internetvotes
save about 2 forrests at each election on paper alone. Normally i would be stuff mentioned at a #Dmeeting so high time to do it

pull him.. let gop gamble on a hillary choice.
It is the President's perogative to nominate or not, and the Senate's to approve or not.
j'ai visité votre pays ,,l'amour est présent,,,,,,,
NO
when I look at that quickly it looks like "Judy Garland"... Thanks for the follow Sheri.
@OFA just keep using that executive pen til it runs out of ink, your approval rating always been higher than laziest  Congress
@OFA YOU HAVE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE
@OFA por favor necesitamos con urgencia frenarlo. No merecemos tanto daño.
@OFA I think that they should Ll 

The Senate should all be dismissed
 We would be if we didn't do our job.
@OFA  OBAMA?
ABD  NO FRANCE NO ALMANYA NO 
İNGİLİZ NO Danimarka No İSRAİL NO
 ***** MADEİN TURKEY *****

Nah. Let Hillary nominate @billmaher next year instead.
@OFA Agree but they won't. It will come back full circle in November
@OFA NOW
"I dunno. Seems like a good idea to hold the seat open for a populist trainwreck that none of us wants to be pres."~ Senate GOP
@OFA agree  #CongressNeedToVoteNow
@OFA terrorist pkk terrorist pyd...
Agree. GOP should vote. Even if it's to unanimously vote no, they should atleast vote. That is the democratic, the American way
this one http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/atarius/images/6/6e/Judges6kp.jpg …
or we could wait a few months to see what the people want. #newideas #reasonswe vote
It is too late.
Only if dine before the election, otherwise, if HRC wins, she should ask Obama to withdraw nomination and teach GOP lesson
@OFA I agree with that decision.. stop playing Senate!!!!
@OFA hi this is shamaria McClellan your personal trainer grandorth his name is Cornell McClellan
@OFA Yes or No, should be heard.
DISAGREE. Senate is exercising its Constitutional rights and responsibility to not turn SCOTUS into socialist rubber stamp.
@OFA they are not going to do nothing#vote themout
@OFA it's not too late to #EndTheDrugWar say you agree #Liberty #EndAssetForfeiture #EndGovtProfiteering the drug war is wrong.
Senate do your job 
no more obstruction
#VoteGOPOut
let hillary nominate a more progressive judge now. The Repubs had their chance for a conservative
I agree! Something they don't want to do. 
Go back to your golf game, Barry. President Trump will be picking the next SCOTUS nominee. Tee off! TRUMP 2016!
@OFA Absolutely. But soon, they will be pondering your nominee or Hilary's. That might light the fire under their, er, feet
@OFA I AGREE
@OFA  Move on bro, shit ain't happening.
What's the hurry?
@OFA مساء الخير سيدي الرئيس أعتقد مع شعبي نريد أن يكون لبلدنا رئيس امرأة وليس رجل وهيا موجودة ولانريد من النظام أمتلاك السلطة
@OFA
Dont agree, Obama did the same thing. He said he does not need congress and that GOP is garbage to him, so screw him
Obviously they don't consent to this nomination.  Nominate a Constitutional conservative.
The Senate has done its job.  They need to advise and consent.
@OFA Why?.Did the rules change? You were behind this same thing in 2008...I guess it's hard for you to remember those days. Lol
the same people that nominated trump? Fair hearing is not possible
why... it is never late
@OFA ... Ya
@OFA l agree Mr. President
@OFA when are you going to fight terrorism in Iran and North Korea  instead of this nonsense that will be taking care of in Jan
.@BarackObama Thoughts on Kamoli?

@OFA i agree too  that.
i don't agree with you hussein on anything
@OFA i dooooooo.
After #FailedObamaCare, you have the guts to share your stupid ideas again? Just go back to #marthasvineyard until 2017...
@OFA agreed
No.
