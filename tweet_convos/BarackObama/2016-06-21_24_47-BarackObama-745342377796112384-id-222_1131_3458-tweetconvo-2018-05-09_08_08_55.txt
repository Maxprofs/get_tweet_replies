Build 10,000 nuclear plants

@mashable es la única solución para salvar al planeta
@mashable 
Once upon a time I believed Barack Hussein Osama and his talks about HOPE & CHANGE

> @BarackObama Why Centralised Solar Power by the Govt?
Why Every House Not Independently & Fully Solar Powered?
kkk
Cleanly produced part sin china and not in america cutting out jobs.
@mashable lots to things need to be xplored but fossil fuel love still exists is reason for delay...
@BarackObama
in 20 years when the solar panels need to be replaced the solar era will be over
we should make it possible for consumers to go off grid. Axe laws preventing citizens the choice not to hook up to utilities
@mashable out of reach for a lot of us

@mashable @dalishaofyork@I love the USA and England @
"Clean energy" (Not really clean) is here to stay only because tax payers are being forced to fund it. #ActOnClimate
@BarackObama

We passed #pointofnoreturn already. Waterworld is coming. What's the point?
I wanted to make a @Korn reference but that'll Make Me look Bad
@mashable are you aware you exhale CO2? 

seriously, are you aware of this?
So are fossil fuels, unless you want the end of plant life as well.
@mashable And take control out of the hands of the oil companies.
@mashable   Everyone i
@Barksyfan  Your the man who started it all , the solar roll out ..

@mashable cant we create some poles in typically stormy areas of the planet and store the energy from lightening?
@mashable back in the '60's in ND we had a lot of houses with solar panels and every farm had working windmills....progress!!
we also had gasahol (spelling) made from corn...
Can be done and econimically if big business keeps out of it....ND 
@mashable Obviously so is #Global #climateengineering #SRM & #Haarp as well How about putting a BAN on #GeoEngineering Please ♡
RT"@BarackObama, #CleanEnergy.And It's not,"only",One-Sole-Person's Opinion. More-&-More people/Firms see this as The Future !
@mashable clean up your landfill mess of materials that could be recycled how bout you start there
Hi Sir. What about the push back from our local energy companies? 
Keep your seat for 4 more years. Let's really make em nuts!
is science working with #populationdynamics ? What is industrial production aim for earths welfare ?
@DoYouScience hydrogen fuel cells and Fusion power
Fusion power is still out of our reach today unfortunately
then we won't have clean power. Not every one hasa navada to use as solar fields
There are far more ways to generate clean power. Here in my country we mainly huse hudro electric
this is true. However, it can't be counted on during the dry years. It needs to be diverse
the Netherlands is below sea level, so this source is trusthworthy here. Might be difficult in other
@mashable taco
Clean energy is getting pushed out, forced to close. PG&E agrees to close Diablo Canyon in 2025
yeah! Nuclear power is the more clean possible.
ht
@mashable good news for America
@mashable let's go... let's get it......funding= transformation of our communities one house at a time.
curious to  know if the increase of  solar power will increase the radiation levels especially in cities.
困ったら愛　しかし愛でも困ってしまったらやはり自然に還そう
