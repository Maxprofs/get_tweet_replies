@BarackObama Right On
@BarackObama best president ever!!!!!!
@RunFaster500 @BarackObama He's not even the best democratic president.
@patriot_first @BarackObama so what is he proposing since we he wants stricter gun laws?  Sounds like it's already in place so why complain
@RunFaster500 @BarackObama Liberals make-up reasons for more laws. They think government should control every phase and facet of our lives.
@patriot_first @BarackObama so it should be the Wild Wild West? Lol. Or maybe back to cavemen
@RunFaster500 @BarackObama Did you grow up in a liberal family which didn't own guns?
@patriot_first @BarackObama we can own guns buddy. Just don't let domestic abusers and mentally ill get them.
@RunFaster500 @BarackObama First I'm not your buddy, sonny. Secondly I have doubts you're an NCO. Third, u didn't answer my family question.
@BarackObama Senate do your damn job!
@BarackObama Please for the love of God....make a recess appointment! Just get it done. There's more to do this year.

@BarackObama Why should they start now?
@BarackObama @thumppooh like you did in prev. Rep. nominees?
@BarackObama Barak, you have done the impossible which the USA invented. but they- the american people denied morality- yes it sucks
@BarackObama you tell them Mr president.
@BarackObama wow , people are talking shit
@BarackObama true
@BarackObama Nominate Ben Carson, then you'll get America behind you.
@BarackObama Congress' job is not to do as POTUS wishes but to do what Congress is mandated to do by our Constitution: confirm or deny.
@BarackObama republubicans are still trying to do what they can to stop him. They are terrified that he may go down as a great president.
@BarackObama @DavidWalenski But they blocked u up to over 100 days on other job selections you suggested just to obstruct,unethical work.
@BarackObama 了不起的总统
@BarackObama Tell Congress to #DoYourJob no excuses,
@BarackObama _Setiap ada yg klik/buka link anda, maka anda akan dibayar USD $ 5. 
maka anda sdh menerima USD $ 300.

@BarackObama Maybe you should nominate one before accusing Congress of not doing their job.  How about you do you job first and lead??
@BarackObama well what would one expect from the Republican Party, they are the party of irresponsible, the party of no.
@BarackObama So true.
@BarackObama American PEOPLE were the employer, if YOUR employee doesn't work, FIRE THEM.. Whats the process Mr. President ? petitions?
@BarackObama Maybe they don't need their job; whats the process of elimination? Were TIRED of paying for nothing!#getthemoutofhere#yourfired
@BarackObama DO URBAN JOB
@BarackObama @DiMurphyMN Weird how things change... http://www.redstate.com/absentee/2016/02/17/obama-regrets-filibuster-supreme-court-appointment-now-turn-appoint/ …
@BarackObama You are dead wrong your motive is to fill the post so you can tip the scale toward the kind. It has nothing to do with duty.
@BarackObama @Made0fHonor You'd think it would be unconstitutional! Job descriptions usually have meaning.
@BarackObama @Senate Senate Do Your Job! OUR Forefathers Are Watching!
@BarackObama The republican party is so pitiful it should end . Imagine what more you could have accomplished if they did their jobs !
@BarackObama as long as  you do not nominate a socialist disaster who does not believe in the Constitution, I agree.
@BarackObama Please don't nominate, on average most President do what is right for our country, you are not exactly batting 100%
@BarackObama I am surprised we use social media to #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @Peacepox Thank you for standing strong , Mr President ! You're the best.. For them to obstruct your work makes them the worst
@BarackObama #getout

@BarackObama #DoYourJob @Senators!
@BarackObama take this issue head on and show some strong leadership #makeithappen
@BarackObama @MoveOn if you would just uphold the laws of the land it would be a start!
@BarackObama @MoveOn Not with your shitty liberal track record! Leave now!
@BarackObama @MoveOn nominating any republican 4 scotus wen u r a democrat pres=THE MOST IRRESPONSIBLE THING EVER DO YOUR U R A DEMOCRAT JOB
@BarackObama   the job of the senate,  as I see it,  is to stifle you at every turn for the rest of your term
@BarackObama @panegron
@BarackObama @MoveOn It is responsible to prevent the court from getting more liberal than it already is.
@BarackObama I am confused.Biden said none should even be considered before there was even an opening.
@BarackObama lol
@BarackObama THIS begs the question: why should THIS nomination be any different from Dubya's, Clinton's et. al? Other tweeters pls respond.
@BarackObama You first!! Everything u do is for YOU, not America. You are the definition of irresponsibility!
@BarackObama 
History is your judge between you and the senate.
@BarackObama straight talk...#DoYourJob
@BarackObama @petethorn now the petulant man-child wants compromise?  Forget it.  The Community Agitator in Chief should stick to bad golf.
@BarackObama The PEOPLE have elected a balance on your power. Don't talk tradition, you'd break any tradition you could to suit your will.
@BarackObama Republicans obfuscation is futile & on its last leg.They wil have to deal with another democrat in the WH comes the election.
@BarackObama Presumably anyone you nominate will also think that "case law" is law; even though it is not; we do not need them on the court.
@BarackObama DOMA is valid law unless & until repealed by congress; not the court. You did not defend the law so you're unfit to nominate.
@BarackObama A savvy senator would introduce legislation to reduce the number of justices to eight and preempt your nomination.
@BarackObama 67 days or 670 days there is no constitutional time constraint or mandate for nine members. It can be changed to eight.
@BarackObama To the contrary, refusing to consider your nominee is prudent and responsible; your submitting a nomination is irresponsible.
@BarackObama Voters make it clear we want this done, now.  Or else find another job.,
@BarackObama Please go ahead an nominate who you think is best  for the job, full speed ahead. Concentrate on this, main objective.
@BarackObama @WiscChief worried you win the election #wiunion
@BarackObama fun watching the GOP and radical right wing go down in their own flames...
@BarackObama do your job also!
@BarackObama leave it for the new president.
@BarackObama damn right.
@BarackObama i humbly wish to visit America before the end of your administration really appreciate your contribution u are great leader
@BarackObama #KarmaTrain
@BarackObama respect for you sir.
@BarackObama For people who SAY they believe in the Constitution, these representatives seem to go against it a LOT!
@BarackObama VETS BEFORE ILLEGALS.
@BarackObama #DoYourJob Its silly to pay people to not do what they are paid to do!!!

@BarackObama How about you just leave the white house then? The American people are tired of you.
@BarackObama This isn't a bipartisan issue, but the #Republicans made it one. It is ridiculous to expect you to wait. Now if it was Nov....

@BarackObama And the Obama Sucks goes to..
.the Supreme Court. Congratulations ladies and gentleman Senates. The Sirs. are so hurry.
@BarackObama Mr. President do what you think is right and good. Lord knows someone has too. Let the HATERS HATE and criticize.
@BarackObama It's a shame that the Senate refuses their job because of bigotry / racism.  So wonder Trump will be the GOP nominee.
@BarackObama the GOP's only interested in themselves!!
@BarackObama Boo hoo...

@BarackObama Deralect in duty and disrespectful to the enth degree. The word Shall is compelling. Steel your resolve!

@BarackObama I can't imagine ever going to work and refusing to do your job
@BarackObama
@BarackObama good luck to u. hahaha
@BarackObama Saying you will veto a bill before the Senate passes it is irresponsible, too.
@BarackObama lol, do you have 300 work days scheduled before you leave office XD
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @livegreenordie black smoke at the Scotus conclave
@BarackObama, whoever the president is at the time is required by the constitution to nominate the next Supreme Court justice.
@BarackObama listen to your Vice President and do not nominate as a lame duck.
"@BarackObama: Refusing to consider a #SCOTUS nominee before one is even announced is irresponsible. #DoYourJob 

Bork, Bork, Bork.
@BarackObama @RealDwneastDiva are the guys serious? What is their problem.....
@BarackObama Do your job Mr. O. Stop ignoring the constitution and start following/defending it. I think that was in your oath?
@BarackObama #webelieveinyou
@BarackObama So announce one and force them to or face voter backlash at polls.  Enough with the tough talk, you need to do your job first.
