@BarackObama 
Thank God for this,you have saved many lives as well as emotional stress and strains from families and individuals.
@BarackObama isn't this why I was taken off of my parents plan long before I turned 26
@BarackObama Why would I want that? I'm teaching my young adult children to be self-sufficient. Hence, ADULT.
And then 27 year olds fined out how much healthcare cost and go "OMFG" It's so expensive..
@BarackObama
@BarackObama No incentive for them to get a job; rather, continue to rely on their parents.

@BarackObama it is not free.  A premium is charged as if they carried their own policy.
@BarackObama the only thing I know is I'm paying more for health care now then ever before. For the worse plan I've ever had.
@BarackObama This was a thing before obamacare.....

@BarackObama. My work place has connived with a union to force employees with union membership to collect our health/welfare money.....
@BarackObama so you want our kids to become dependent adults. This is completely wrong. They need to grow up on their own and make mistakes.

@BarackObama but ignore the premium jumps and coverage reductions :) insurance companies love it
@BarackObama very funny Mr President 
@BarackObama why is this a good thing? We're teaching young Americans you have until 26 to get it together now? Gov't will take care of you.
@BarackObama and yet they can still vote?
@Jon_H_Hall @BarackObama why do u think he's still in office..
@BarackObama and once your 26 you can't afford healthcare
@BarackObama weird how americans need their parents until their 26. its almost like you dont want anyone to live on their own.
@BarackObama Nice maymay Mister President
@BarackObama :/
@BarackObama ;Great ,by then they should realize it,s time to move out and get their own insurance and life.
@BarackObama They need to because none of them can find jobs in your anemic economy.
@BarackObama  but im stuck paying over $100 a week plus deductible and then copays because insurance companies can charge whatever they want
@BarackObama yeah but most of those 26year olds would rather have a good job and be on their own. Did you forget about jobs?
@BarackObama will you pay for me to go to college please
@BarackObama you are the best Mr. ROBIN HOOD....
@BarackObama and live in the basement, play on Xbox, watch Netflix and smoke weed.....that is the best

@BarackObama Thanks Mr President
@jamewill19491 @BarackObama Ask Republicans why they don't want U with health care!

@BarackObama Dude, it's time to move out of your mom's basement. Also Crazy Emma Stone isn't the look you should go for here
@BarackObama I feel like we should fix the problems preventing 18 year olds from being independent. Can't afford an apartment on min wage.
@traviswcunning @BarackObama then find a better job.. and learn economics
@slick_nick615 that's a pretty arrogant statement
@traviswcunning take it how you want. its proven raising minimum wage wont do anything but hurt our economy.get a good job or find roommates
@slick_nick615 how is someone supposed to pay rent and utility's and for college without going into debt or live with parents?
@traviswcunning roommates, grants, student loans, scholarships. I work fulltime. go to school online. with two kids. it can be done
@slick_nick615 "Without going into debt" was the point I was trying to make.
@BarackObama Seriously, with the GIF? Show some class and stop pandering.
@BarackObama making it illegal to go without Healthcare will be the next big scam, right along side other insurance providers #WakeUpAmerica
