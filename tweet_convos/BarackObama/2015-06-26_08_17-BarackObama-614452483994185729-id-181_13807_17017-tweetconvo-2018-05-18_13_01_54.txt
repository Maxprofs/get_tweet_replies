@BarackObama Mr President, there are people that have been killed by terrorists today in some countries, pls focus on these.
@osagie1966 Wow, bigoted much??? this is OUR day.
@nestene89 Enjoy your day in your immorality whilst terrorists are causing casualties in the world. I am entitled to my views too. BLOCKED.
@osagie1966 @nestene89 how is it immoral?
@derdom90 @nestene89 Read the Bible and find out for yourself. Not getting involved in arguments. I am entitled to my views too.
@osagie1966 @derdom90 @nestene89 only a few passages on homosexuality. Countless passages on love and acceptance. Do read your bible
@ChrisChrispaik @derdom90 @nestene89 Love and acceptance has nothing to do with homosexuality. Understand the Bible u are quoting to me!!!
@osagie1966 @derdom90 @nestene89 unless you are stoning people for working on Sundays. Which is in 10 commandments, you're cherry picking
@BarackObama hope and change Mr. President. Thank you.
@BarackObama congratulation,  great success
@BarackObama FROM NOW HENCEFORTH AMERICA WILL CONTINUE TO BE WEAK BECAUSE OF TOLERANCE TO EVIL.
@BarackObama I am sorry for America! !! ! Still "God's own country"? I doubt. ...!!!!!!

@BarackObama The Constitution does not define marriage. God did over 6000 years ago when He gave Eve to Adam. 1 man + 1 woman, period.
@BarackObama NO TO SINFUL MARRIAGE!

@BarackObama marriage is between a male and female and not otherwise. There is nowhere in nature where we see something different.
@BarackObama  u are a fool, how can u praise  an unnatural and inhuman decision of ur suprem court, don't u think its ruining social values?
"@BarackObama: "This morning the Supreme Court recognized the Constitution guarantees marriage equality." Cannabis Is Next Right Bruh?
@BarackObama you don't deserve to sit in OUR White House.  God will show his wrath on you and not your Allah but Jesus Christ
@BarackObama now that gay marriage is taken care of let's keep working harder towards that reformation act 
@BarackObama now if only we could do something about the job market, ISIS, and the open boarder.

@BarackObama the 14th amendment was created for former slaves, not to create more immorality in our country.
@braidsandweaves @BarackObama they are morally superior truly aren't because if so they would know there is only one JUDGE AND JURY.
