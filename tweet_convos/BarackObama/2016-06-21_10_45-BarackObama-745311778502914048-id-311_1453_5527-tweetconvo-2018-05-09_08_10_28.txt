WHY do you say there's something sacred about a place but can't speak the name of the only one who is the SACRED ONE OF ALL GOD
When you are not there. You are right Obozzo.
Didn't realize Yosemite had anything to do with Islam. Learn something every day!

It is a wondrous place...
There is nothing more beautiful and powerful than feeling the strenght of nature,visiting them its advisable if you have stress
Even if U practice meditation, it is outstanding!!  will find special things about U being in contact with nature..!!
Will find a simple thing,both are alive...!!! and are same part of everything in different ways..
I will tell you Stimes., i wake up at 4 or 5 am,go out, and look at the dark blue sky full of stars, that clarify my thoughts !
And that silence makes me feel part of this immensity, I have taken most of the decisions at that time..!!
