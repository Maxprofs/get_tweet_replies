@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Thank you.
@theerobmac @barackobama @everytown @nba if a gang breaks into your home what would you do? call police(eta 7min) or grab a gun off shelf?
@MediaBiasPolice @TheeRobMac Marines, Seals, and Rangers get killed in ambushes but GI Joes of Twitter think they're superheroes. Smh
@chellegaylor24 @TheeRobMac okay so you choose police. Great! waiting time is approx 7 minutes. Hope all is well during a break in!
@MediaBiasPolice @chellegaylor24 I'm not worried about a gang. A gang ain't worried about me. I rock the good rhymes, I don't gang bang
@TheeRobMac @chellegaylor24 sure, whatever you say delusional liberal. I guess in a liberal world criminals do not exist. Pelosi lover..
@MediaBiasPolice @chellegaylor24 Otherwise STFU with your stupidity.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA My #DC neighborhood has seen a 100% increase in homicides this year. TY for taking a stand.
@politicalpearl @barackobama @everytown @nba proof please.
@Everytown @NBA Awesome segment. Well done. We have the potential to be a great nation. Potential.
@misscwilshire @everytown @nba potential to be a great nation? we are a great nation liberal zealot. Ban cars, ban knives, ban tools etc
@MediaBiasPolice @Everytown @NBA You're super awesome. Keep it up 
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Make 100$ in  10 minutes http://goo.gl/tlncfa 
@Everytown @NBA I'm so sick of these people. I carry a gun everyday. Legally. I'm a threat to nobody. Disarming good people does what? Zero!
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA CLEAN UP THE GANG & DRUG DEALER PROBLEMS BEFORE YOU SLAM HONEST GUN OWNERS. YOU BLAME THE GUN NOT THE THUGS
@Everytown @NBA im in....
@HarryWeed1 @Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Crickets! Of course, he had a government badge. That gives him magical powers.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Barack Obama is the same guy who armed up the Mexican drug cartel's in "operation fast and furious"
@Everytown @adrielhampton @NBA Speak to the crazies who get their guns illegally. The problem is he heart of man.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA go after the criminals Obama has it all wrong. Donald Trump will win in 2016
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA  I'm just using my glock for protection
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA don't focus on the weapon used to commit the crime. focus on the criminal! tougher punishment!
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA works so good in Chicago. Get a clue
@Everytown @adrielhampton @NBA Left wing propaganda
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Tell it to the gang bangers.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Happy New Year's
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA I am a responsible gun owner w/CCL. It is for the protection of me and anyone who is near. I will not be a wimp
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA yeah we can! By having stricter laws against criminals. Last time I checked the gun doesn't fire by itself.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA gun violence needs to end
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Obuma when will you "gun violence" your guards? How about tell Americans to get armed.
@Everytown @NBA a better video would be to tell young black men to get a job and stop fathering children out of wedlock. #guns are not prob
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Help all Americans keep all Your Ten Commandments daily O Holy Lord God our Father we pray.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA There is no such thing as "gun violence". Violence is violence! Quit lying to us!
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Lets talk statistics of black men compared to white and about crimes committed in gun free vs gun holding areas
@Everytown @NBA
@Everytown @NBA Gun should never be an option? Then disarm your secret service @BarackObama - Self defense not limited to political elites!
@Everytown @NBA @BarackObama I think you mean people violence dipshits

@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA I am really afraid of cars know after the woman in Las Vegas ran over 34 people when will u put limits on cars
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Your Street gang dirty thugs will always get their guns ,your just trying to keep good peeps from protection

@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA algo estás haciendo mal cuando la gente compra armas de fuego legalmente #cosasdecajón
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA  damn you liberals tryin to steal ir guuuns (sarcasm)
@Everytown @NBA @BarackObama  Chi Raq a Spike Lee Joint
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA How 'bout "End Malignant Violent Behaviors in Men"?Responsibility lies within the souls of individuals,not guns
@Everytown is just a pawn in @BarackObama game of gun bans for better population control and now the @NBA is stupid enough to go political.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA @Pontifex 해피 크리스마스~
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA to #EndGunViolence you have to equate it to sex. Sex Ed in school reduces teen pregnancy. Why not gun safety?
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA to #EndGunViolence invite the @NRA to your school for the Eddy Eagle gun safety class.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA one way to #EndGunViolence is to buy one, take #NRA classes & teach your kids about safe use of guns. Duh!
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA why do you idiots only focus on a small percentage of violence? End all violence, not just #EndGunViolence
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA of course
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA magnifique !
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Excellent!
@Everytown @NBA thank you for showing a social conscience hopefully many other sports bodies will follow in your bold & pioneering footsteps
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA this is stupid and offensive and infringes on my rights. Obama and NBA are traitors to constitution
@Everytown @NBA whining about 2mend rights what about right 2 freedom & pursuit of happiness without the FEAR of being SHOT in that pursuit
@Everytown @NBA tweet like this will be targeted by the worst Gun advocates & @NRA they will try 2 besmirch UR efforts stand Strong & United
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA http://www.marasticaritaksi.com/hizmetler-262.html …
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA my guns haven't killed anyone. I'll keep mine. Thanks
@Everytown @NBA as for Gun lovers that has vowed to never watch NBA again -- people like that the NBA fan base can do without (thanks NBA)
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA American cowboy Yankees always there way self defense imposibility to take there Gun?
@Everytown @NBA ty its time to shine a light on this cancer that effects every US citizen on a daily basis
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Hitler must be smiling down at U socialist- lefties very time U join Doombergs crazy train....
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Help us singalong to 300,000,000 Guns
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Well played! Bravo!
I was unaware the was a pro gun violence movement @Everytown @NBA
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA At last POTUS. Use the tools to influence the change we need on gun access. LOVELY
@Everytown @NBA we can do this.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Why not just get rid of the bullets? Limit the bullets to those who are responsible gun owners.
@Free2RiseEd @Everytown @BarackObama @NBA exactly a gun with no ammunition is a ?  hammer
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA  1930's It's still working! Amazing! Yeah! I am going to call it. Hilton.
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA When will it ever end, so much tragedy & sadness that stays with affected people forever!
@Everytown @johnwrght473 @NBA Why not end "people" violence by enforcing the laws on the books and stopping release of thousands of crooks!
@jburtis @Everytown @NBA If thats the answer?We have to do something.
@johnwrght473 @Everytown @NBA It's not THE answer, but an answer. Doctors kill more people every year than guns. Ban doctors? Autos? Booze?
@BarackObama @Everytown @NBA sign me up for some of that non violence and peace!
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA tksthis really has gotten past a cry 4 help lets ALL UNITE to vote on solutions towards a better US
@Everytown @BarackObama @NBA Yea, let's end gun violence NOW! We live in a civilized society, yes? Love guns? Join the army!!
@Everytown @NBA silly people saying they want watch any nba games again
@Everytown @NBA We would love to join in this fight. We have a movement with our @litielaces called NIGHT RIDER to help end violence dm us
@Everytown That tweet deserves to be featured! Check it out: http://rbl.ms/1Y4Mdsk 
@Everytown thanks so much for sharing. Just added it here: https://www.rebelmouse.com/ozaetagroup/oh-brands … http://rbl.ms/1MxthXj 
@Everytown @NBA Paedophiles'll appreciate it if they break into @StephenCurry30 mansion and he doesn't have a gun to defend daughter Riley.
@Everytown @NBA Why can't Gilbert Arenes get a spot?Hypocrisy 
@Everytown @NBA I'll never attend another game.
@Everytown @NBA This is fantastic. Much like the anti-smoking ads that make people rethink current norms. Good stuff.
@Everytown @NBA awesome new PSA. Thank you Steph Curry! #EndGunViolence 
@Everytown @NBA #EndGunViolence  ~ Wouldn't this be a positive change for a brite and productive 2016!
@Everytown @NBA you can't end gun violence by taking away a good guys gun.
@Everytown @NBA how about we focus on ending ALL violence...too much to ask?
@Everytown @NBA Shered this info on FB.
@Everytown @NBA guess I'll stop watching this freedom hating league.
Considering the NBA cultivates and supports thug culture, my disinterest in watching a broadcast or live event is still nil.@Everytown @NBA
@Everytown @NBA A bunch of one percenters, and in the end 'entertainers' telling the little people how to act.. how quaint.
@Everytown @NBA Why do you think gun control is popular with your fan base?
@MrsGrama @Everytown @NBA Because most people disapprove of the slaughtering of innocent people happening regularly in the US?
@Everytown @NBA Disgusted that NBA partners with a group trying to infringe on our rights. I'm a big fan, but am rethinking that now.
@MrsGrama @Everytown @NBA trying to promote ending gun violence =/= infringing on your rights.
@CallMeBane @MrsGrama @Everytown @NBA Look into all of Bloomber's anti-"gun violence" organizations. Cute commercials. anti #2A to the core!
