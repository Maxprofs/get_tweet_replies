@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama  I need to help me
@BarackObama thanks and regards
@BarackObama  i was offered US's passport recently.and my willingness to work in Indiana state of US, which has water border with Canada too
@BarackObama what exactly i keep to defend myself that you have left these armed spies-terrorists of enemy background countries after me?
@BarackObama why you always "want to" help me, if your own people have been a threat over a single, indefensible, civilian like me?
@BarackObama whether its those handling my body for years, or those of Bangladesh+Pakistan, who all work for US+UK+Aust itself?
@BarackObama why do you people help me, if your own people have been threatening me?
@BarackObama  but im always kept under gun point by the establishments of US/UK/Aus itself. i always ask a question
@BarackObama , which could be hardly avoided....
@BarackObama at least kept me safe enough to date. i value it, and kept appreciation after surviving on those many life-murder threats
@BarackObama and yes, first i myself has to be honest to accept that i was always helped on key times, mainly from US's/UK's and Aus leaders
@BarackObama its US's tax payers,why you maintain Air Force One,while keeping these people after me to threaten me in India or anywhere i go
@BarackObama you can't lie to me, this much credibility i do expect from the 'elected' government of US+UK+Aus...
@BarackObama 4 years gone in India itself while continuously living under a life threat,it might be a secret for rest of world, but you know
@BarackObama and its mainly because you people based in US+UK+Aus always know,im an indefensible person walking on roads,easy to threaten me
@BarackObama you have put arms on hands of foreign spies of Pakistan+Bangladesh and other Muslim countries, as funded by budget of US+UK+Aus
@BarackObama you have to maintain passions
@BarackObama hence, even if i start throwing stones on US's embassy for the way me and people related to me suffered
@BarackObama  my behavior has been a response to circumstances i faced. around 4 years gone in India itself, when i arrived here in Aug 2011
@BarackObama and you can't take any action against me, as government resources were used to take out money from my pocket.
@BarackObama even if i dont get a proper response from the US's embassy, im planning to now sit in front of US's embassy from now onwards
@BarackObama as a government as whole, you must be 'honest first'. this much 'credibility' i do expect from the 'elected' government of USA
@BarackObama but you can't lie to me in US's embassy, that you dont know these things continuing with me.
@BarackObama life threats to me by using Bangladeshi+Pakistani false ID infiltrators, very frequently, might be a secret for rest of world.
@BarackObama and US, along with UK+Aus, are part of all these. you simply can't say that you aren't responsible for anything ongoing with me
@BarackObama i live a life everyday, a form of life threat on roads,in my dreams, physical-mental torture etc,is being given to me for years
@BarackObama 2nd; and you can't say you can't help me, while doing so many things with me for so many years.
@BarackObama 1st; when i come to your embassy, you can't say you dont know me.
@BarackObama i would like the leaders of US, mainly governor of Indiana would keep these points in his mind.
@BarackObama My Message for US's leaders before going to US's Embassy tomorrow, on 30th April 2015
@BarackObama People are so weak, did you know drugs wasn't a factor in the great depression. Shit just fucked however.
