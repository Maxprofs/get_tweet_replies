@stef7409 @rosemeadow80 @BarackObama the country was better back then, now just the pussification of america.
@Ryan_Redbeard @stef7409 @BarackObama check in with Lisa Randall, she might be close to solving the issue of dropping you in a parallel uni

@BarackObama @OFA
@BarackObama @OFA ...if the employee works extremely hard they deserve more pay than the person who doesn't work as hard.
@BarackObama @OFA ...then you get paid what the employer believes you earned. If you were lazy, the employee should be fired...
@BarackObama @OFA I disagree. I'll tell you why. You have to earn the money. You have to get an education, actually do the job...
@BarackObama @OFA this is wonderful
@BarackObama @HeforShe @GTK54.  Good One On You, Mr President.
@BarackObama @OFA I dont even know what equal pay for equal work means.

@BarackObama Equal pay for the same job only works if both people have the exact same level of competency..
@BarackObama @OFA I can't believe equal pay is still an issue in 2016
@BarackObama We already have two laws mandating this. Why don't you have your gov agencies find some cases where there is a problem.
