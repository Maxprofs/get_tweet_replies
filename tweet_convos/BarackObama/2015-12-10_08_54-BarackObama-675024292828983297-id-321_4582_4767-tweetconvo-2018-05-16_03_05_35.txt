@Kress_Sandy @WhiteHouse @achievement1st I think he does care.  He has children of his own.
@RodgersCchelsea @WhiteHouse @achievement1st I agree POTUS cares, is a good father, and a good man. He just signed & celebrated a bad bill.

@WhiteHouse @JohnKingatED If you like Your School, You can Keep your school! Sound familiar. ESSA is ObamaCare of education
@WhiteHouse @DDance_BCPS I agree! Here's a poem I was inspired to write! #competewithpurpose
@RenaSofer Unfortunately, the @WhiteHouse and supporters are more into brainwashing rather than educating.
@WhiteHouse @vj44   I agree that every child is entitled to a solid education regardless of any factor.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The end of any nation begins with the ignorance of its citizenship. http://Smashwords.com/RLWJR

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 2/2 people I've never met. By the way, you need to realize you work for us, not the other way around.
@WhiteHouse 
Yes, 100%
@WhiteHouse @esd2000 
Truly a laudable goal, but we're so far from that ideal it's sad.
And privatization of education is not the answer.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 1/2 Depends if they actually work or collect entitlements based on other people's efforts. I don't work to raise
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Amen Mr POTUS
@WhiteHouse @RepZoeLofgren I disagre if you're talking about a private education or about a post secondary education. These are privileges.
@WhiteHouse SR. PRESIDENTE ESPERO SU AYUDA PARA COLOCAR EN ECUADOR LA BANDERA MUNDIAL DE LA NATURALEZA A UN LADO Y LA   BANDERA DELOS EEUU..
@WhiteHouse Then  get government out of education.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama can we please increase the salaries of our nations teachers?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama uhh let's see, the right to life ,liberty, and happiness of own accord, not according to socialistic behavior.
@WhiteHouse @vj44 Many apparently meaningful videos world wants 1 watch~inaccessible, no quality CC -needed #WHccNow
@WhiteHouse then scrap common core because it is not an education, it is indoctrination! Why do you think home schooling has surged!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I did it with that intention
@WhiteHouse @SusanDanzig219 Absolutely. Everywhere in this world. Let US lead.
@WhiteHouse really? So why so you allow for profits *schools* to rob,defraud, and financially rape students ?
@whitehouse @jala_nandini I agree!

@whitehouse yes i agree regardless of race is key for me…and that is why the supreme court is currently reviewing affirmative action

@WhiteHouse "opting out" of standardized testing will only ALLOW UN-EDUCATED parents another route for allowing their child to fail
@WhiteHouse schools should be able to retain those students whom are not passing their grade level !!! can they now with this Act?
@WhiteHouse Stop saying that unless you're going to do something about it. Lay the framework. Overhaul student lending and school prices
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Impressive
@WhiteHouse @slm1022 Yes! Including the #drc children we've adopted! #adoption #uniteourfamilies
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Agreed
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and doesn't deserve a shot at school from a classmate

@WhiteHouse RT if you agree this WH needs to quit DIVIDING America!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Absolutely but need to work hard to have a great level to go to college, no favors for group or race!
@WhiteHouse Better said thousand times before Never Done
@WhiteHouse This country gives ANYONE the chance to go to college with government loans.
@WhiteHouse they already have the opportunity...why do you insinuate that it is different for America..only Muslim nations refuse if not one
@WhiteHouse  #Equal education for all children

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama We do believe that but there are children who give up the chance.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama have them earn it.
@WhiteHouse #Obama
@WhiteHouse @HumanRtsV in life, you only deserve what you earn. We are entitled to nothing, not even certainty that we get another day
@WhiteHouse Every child also deserves a great shot at safety and well-being in child custody cases in the nation's family courts. #Law

#DEM Obama Support Death-2America-Muslims!?%!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Not if there aren't any jobs to accommodate them once they graduate.  Fix the economy and schools /education will follow.
@WhiteHouse yes! Agreed! But they have to work at it! What we need is eliminate selective admissions from colleges instead of freerides.
@WhiteHouse since school is paid for by #government if you aren't getting a "great education" blame government!

@vj44
@WhiteHouse Yes!

RT if you agree:
Every child,
regardless of
race,…
@WhiteHouse Don't we ALL already have a shot at a great education?
@WhiteHouse I thought you wanted to ban guns and now you want everyone to have a "shot". Great wording!
@WhiteHouse ...only a fool would not a agree...I want my children to succeed in life..so I totally agree
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama only if the child cares. Bad children in good schools make it hard for the good children. Kick them out!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama w are humans so why we don't respect each others???
#sample# question without answer.
@WhiteHouse @DannyOrtega02 How about the "Every Parent Does Their Job" Act? That might work a lil better than dumbing down top students!
@WhiteHouse they deserve a shot at the best education that they can afford, not necessarilly
@WhiteHouse @potuss The more government, the worse it gets.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Give just 5%-10% of military budget to education. We need to EDUCATE our future.
.@WhiteHouse Every child, regardless of race, income, or zip code, deserves a shot at a great edu" Q 4 @vj44: Why do they not 'have a shot"?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama duh. We need an overhaul that funds schools & generously compensates great teachers.
@WhiteHouse about your post on childrens education you forgot disability please dont forget we matter too at least I hope we do Mr.president
@WhiteHouse,Thank you President Obama. #NoChildLeftBehind .
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and a world without the pollition made by the previous generation's mistakes
@WhiteHouse I wish every leader is as concerned as POTUS
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Reality check, Truancy rates in inner city black neighborhoods is about 50%, how about showing up!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I just hope new law is as good as No Child Left Behind. More local control can be good or bad -- luck of the draw.
@WhiteHouse the government shouldn't be involved in educating our children
@mkues65 @WhiteHouse I'm so tired of suspending my logic mind with this guy. all i can say is 1 20 17

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Hmmm just like Hilary. Retweeting your own tweets as if they were someone else's. Slippery. Slimy.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama who wouldn't agree with that
.@WhiteHouse I agree but students were sacrificed for the special interests of Teachers Unions! @UFT @AFTunion @rweingarten #Shameless
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Without parental involvement, guidance and high expectations...just more of the same! Demographics spell it out
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Lol Every Person deserves to drink water
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Indeed, but some people just can't afford even if you have a shot
@WhiteHouse @HumanRtsV Is it just me who thinks that this man is the worst #POTUS since Warren Gamaliel Harding?  Only asking!  Honest.
@WhiteHouse I do - including the millions being aborted every year. Every child matters, no matter how old. #POTUS #doublestandards
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #DREAMACT #DACA recipients are almost fossilized, when will you bring them out of the shadows?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama If you destroy teacher education programs, how will your democratic aims get met? Who will teach?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how about free college!!!! #gradschoolproblems
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yes. Let's make "Right to Education" & "Right to Safe Childhood" - Fundamental Right of every Child in the world.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama UNDER BUSH WE OFFERED VOUCHERS FOR ALL FOR BETTER EDUCATION, DEMS/LIBS TURNED IT DOWN.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes that right every child desave good education.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama OF COURSE HE MEANS ILLEGALS AND MUSLIMS.  WE NEED SOME EXEMPTIONS TO OBAMA TRYING TO BANKRUPT THE USA
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama than make it illegal for a state government to give specific schools more money in the state based on test scores
