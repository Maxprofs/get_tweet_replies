@BarackObama Morality and True Justice, must again be Our focus, and priority, along with True Freedom through Knowledge with Integrity. YK
@YULANDAJONES @BarackObama Huh? Surely gun control must be the priority?
@PaulOBrien82 @BarackObama We already have laws against guns, when used criminally.
@YULANDAJONES @BarackObama I'm astonished at the lack of thought put into that response.
@PaulOBrien82 @BarackObama Don't get you're meaning. What I said was true. Astonished because I disagree or it's just that simple? YK
@YULANDAJONES @BarackObama Had he not had access to a gun I doubt his trigger finger would've been a such a threat.
@PaulOBrien82 where are you from?
@AaronSeitsinger Bad people will always find a way but why make it easy for them. To be clear I haven't said banning guns is a solution.
@BarackObama how do you do that EFFECTIVELY while also respecting the 2nd amendment?
@firewifesara @BarackObama Reasonable 2015 adapt: "Well regulate" the "militia" via training, testing, licensing and registration of tools.
@KRMarlo I will not register my guns. Registration leads to confiscation.
@AaronSeitsinger *shrug* Then this is an impasse. Bye.
@KRMarlo so you're not going to back your point but just block. Typical
@AaronSeitsinger Typical? Because I don't want to engage with a wall? Neither of us will will change each other's mind. Why waste our time?
@KRMarlo I just want your input
@AaronSeitsinger I gave it. What I feel about what "well reg militia" means in 2015 is clear & stated. You won't. Where do we go from there?
@Octotron @BarackObama Dead bodies R THE POINT. It's political RIGHT NOW. Walking into a church & shooting people makes it an urgent matter.
@Octotron @BarackObama Australia banned guns after their last mass shooting and it prevented MANY tragedies. PROVEN. Ideology based in fact.
@BarackObama @MisterHoonLee 
WAY too rhetorical to have any significant meaning.  Par.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama    The Government has the power to make laws and we have to follow it. Vote to make Drift a law they would have to obey it.
@BarackObama  bright blessings and courage.
@BarackObama Kudos Obama, keep it up. Time to continue to show what you are made of!
@BarackObama Thanks Mr President.just have faith in GOD that it will solve. if there is backup from you i can help am sure of this...
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @ricoliv76 UM GOVERNO SÉRIO SE IMPÕE. UM GOVERNO CORRUPTO É MOTIVO DE CHACOTA DIÁRIA. VERGONHOSO.
@PauloJahara @BarackObama Sim é verdade, mas é necessário que as pessoas falem mais de política, mesmo que seja para aprender com os erros.
I strongly believe this. We can't normalize this. We can't sit home and hope it gets better. We have to participate.
I will really miss Obama very much. A brilliant and calm man with a great sense of humor.
Difference is you "doing something" is the government getting all control. America is about Americans, the People, controlling.
@BarackObama m, yes Mr president ..!
@BarackObama @DamnAnts Nope

@BarackObama what also makes me sad is all of these idiots who just want a follow back.
@AmbyFelix @BarackObama So inappropriate!
@BarackObama you said it, Mr. President. It's time for action.
@BarackObama @lanebrooks Israel has more guns per capita than the U.S. yet .009 per 100K homicide rate. U.S. Is 2.26 and 95% black/brown.
@GregFlippen @BarackObama Gun culture = mass death. NRA is a terrorist organization.
They do more for safety and education than anyone else. Get a grip on reality man. Killers usually own/use ILLEGALLY.
@BarackObama To honor the 9 #Charleston victims, be kind and practice forgiveness for 9 days. #9lives9days #LoveWins in the #USA.
@tatebe @BarackObama and after 9 days you stop?!
@KeithBraceJohn @BarackObama I will not stop, will you?
@tatebe @BarackObama The American people need to unite and organise and force their government to radically amend gun laws.
@BarackObama vous êtes un grand monsieur continuer comme çà

@BarackObama BAN GUNS THEN
@Abcmsaj @BarackObama seriously? Ban guns = millions of lawful citizens more so vulnerable to violence without defense. Ban ignorance.
@IzzNoland also... there's other ways to defend yourself without using guns
@punkiexoxo the day will not come when we can reconcile all guns that would be "banned." Not sure what else helps against an automatic rifle
@BarackObama    The President and the Government make a law to Drift the gangs, and any man or woman doing wrong

.
@BarackObama  There's only one way to stop killing the government bring back the Drift.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @Lynda_Tran I agree!
@BarackObama Amen
@BarackObama @HaveSippy How do you plan to address this problem in the face of widespread moral apathy and denial?
@vapemyworld @BarackObama I didn't know I personally had to make a plan to deal with all the bigots of the world. P1.
@HaveSippy That was addressed to the Pres Samantha :)
@BarackObama I agree, but retweeting a meme is as insufficient as taking down a fucking flag, Racism Strong in the NORTH
@BarackObama hi Mr president
@BarackObama @Lesism Which issue is this? Mass murder? gun control? Racism? He is right for all three.
@BarackObama hello my brother
@BarackObama Hi my brother

@BarackObama So shall it be...Mr President.
@BarackObama @Kieran_Gilbert Race Hucksters gonna Huckster I guess.
