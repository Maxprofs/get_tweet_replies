I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.
@BarackObama it takes courage to be a Christain but guess you don't want to comment on that! Do you?
@PanicItsSophie @BarackObama There is no courage following ones self glorification  It's the easiest thing in the world to do
@PanicItsSophie @BarackObama I just wonder why the BS thrown at me 4 saying Christians facing death in ME don't deserve shout out 4 courage
@PanicItsSophie @BarackObama We all have way bigger problems than Jenner but Obama sees fit to call her courageous
@BarackObama no that is not the definition of courage.  Maybe to you who never had any.
@BarackObama Well, if anyone should know you should, since you're married to one.
@BarackObama Does that mean Edward Snowden is the most courageous man on the planet?
@BarackObama Stop Trying to act like obama you catfish
.@rdenny43
@rdenny43 Thats the real obama
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner this is a leader @TonyAbbottMHR
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner  it really takes courage to stand against it, in a world like today.
@BarackObama  may we always be as kind to people who share the same story as Caitlyn.
@BarackObama Believe me, it's hard to live as LGBT but even harder to live as an Iranian immigrant in the US. Gov rules over all your rights
@Ghsrdsht @BarackObama No it is not. Beverly Hills is 40 percent Iranian. Stop bullshitting. Persians are absolutely killing it.
@smithson988 your logic is childish. Grow up and educate yourself, then we can have a talk.
@BarackObama What does take courage is single parents raising kids on their own!Man in drag isnt courage!
@BarackObama  @Caitlyn_Jenner Obamaaa
@BarackObama you're kidding, right?
@BarackObama  Did you know, not all that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed unless it is faced.
@BarackObama the more our society tries to free itself from gender sterotype, the more it becomes ensleved by it....@Caitlyn_Jenner

@BarackObama 
All the courage in the world isn't essentially going to change biological sex.
@BarackObama It is very apparent that poor Bruce Jenner is a mentally disturbed person. He needs psychiatric help.
@BarackObama  @Caitlyn_Jenner TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE SAYING WE SHOULD BE THANKING THE TROOPS FOR HAVING COURAGE !!!

@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner hey obama
@BarackObama According to my boss when I taught at OU, it takes more courage to say you are a Christian now than to say you are gay.
@BarackObama Epa marico qlq
@BarackObama Que sepas que Tyler se caga en ti por no rellenar los huecos de la via con mas cemento
@BarackObama Can we give every MTF & FTM TS an award for simply being too?

@BarackObama @laurenduca not interested in Bruce or his feminine counterpart
@BarackObama @betobuzali Acerca de @CaitJennerr  Sr. Presidente, en México decimos; "Se necesitan huevos para compartir tu historia" @aldan

I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.
@BarackObama It takes courage for our men and women who serve this country everyday for our protection.  They deserve your praise.
@BarackObama I LOVE U
@BarackObama Maybe you need to go look up the definition of courage again.
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner it might take just a teensy bit more courage to fight in americas armed forces
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner no, it takes courage to serve for your country not get a damn sex change.
@BarackObama Indeed to much courage
Excuse us... @BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner
@BarackObama stories Sir
@BarackObama @madapocalypse   To fight against the food industry takes courage.  Its not about exercise, its about bad food.
@BarackObama You tyrant, you and every other evil manipulative stain on this planet will fail.
@BarackObama I agree with you 100%
@BarackObama president goals
@BarackObama, Your piece of shit #LeaveTheOfficeEarly  #dumbass
@BarackObama How embarrassing that you acknowledge Jenner. Why are you such a Hollywood suckup? Stop the BS and run the government!
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner STAN BARACK
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner YES
@BarackObama TAKE NOTES EVERYONE
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner
@BarackObama it would be even more courageous to apologize to the world for your ineptitude
@BarackObama You can praise BRUCE Jenner but not the men and women who put their lives on the line for this country? Sickening.
@BarackObama I'm sure he/she appreciates your taking time out from your golf to send him a message...
@BarackObama No, it takes great courage to be a Christian in the Middle East... and even more since you entered the White House.
@BarackObama That's almost as funny as your claiming my insurance premiums would go down $2,500 per year!
@BarackObama I guess we need to redefine 'courage'. How can you compare courage of a soldier to this 'freak'? @AndreaTantaros @megynkelly
@BarackObama using words like #courage & #hero to describe Jenner, is a disgrace
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner hey POTUS ! heard of Akon's solar power initiative aimed to bring power to 600 million Africans? No? Okay then.
@BarackObama takes even more courage to put on a cop uniform and protect our citizens, even when our elected officials turn on them
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner Smart...@espn
@BarackObama Remember, it's not from the President, if it's not signed with "-bo".

"Who's Bryce Jennero? -bo"
@BarackObama @hipsterferre @Caitlyn_Jenner YAAAAAS
@BarackObama I LOVE YOU
@BarackObama YAAAAS BARACK
@BarackObama lmao
@BarackObama you would know nothing about courage.. Your presidency had made that clear
@BarackObama what a shame
@BarackObama @Noah_Galloway sure does.
@BarackObama MR PRESIDENT YOU DON'T GET REDEFINE COURAGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A MAN DOING A VANITY FAR SHOOT BECAUSE OF A REALITY SHOW
@BarackObama it takes courage to tell the truth, something you're most certainly lacking.
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner lmao bullshit. Try again.
@BarackObama @slytherinmalia @Caitlyn_Jenner YAS OBAMA
@BarackObama Since when does it take courage to tuck your genitals and wear a dress. - Courage is fighting a war or being a policeman.
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner yall are both embarrassments, no one gives a shit
. @BarackObama just gonna leave this here for your leisure, Mr President
@BarackObama nope
@BarackObama ily
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner it takes courage to ruin a country.
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner S M H
@barackobama yes, you're right...!
@BarackObama Perhaps Jenner can share what he was thinking/doing when he KILLED a woman in a car accident. Way to pick your role models.
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner mr.obama..take the courage and stop killing syirans.
Over one million are killed in syria.
Have a heart MAN.
@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner Mr. President, don't you have other things to worry and talk about?

@BarackObama @Caitlyn_Jenner wtf Obama
