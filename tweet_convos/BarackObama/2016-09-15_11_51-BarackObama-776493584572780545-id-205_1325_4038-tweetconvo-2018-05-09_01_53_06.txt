The constitution also says that our right to own and carry arms shall not be infringed.
No hearing needed if you nominate without prior consult with the Senate. By and with means your full cooperation beforehand!
President just a curiosity, have you ever taken a bath like this. Look how lucky this chap is
@WashTimes Why are you bringing this up? Only reason is you think Hillary will loose. Not going to happen #novote
this congress is not interested in doing the people's business! So speak out by going to VOTE!!
Neither is the Pres., He's only in it to destroy America, and make some money along the way !
before I block you Obama will go down in history as greatest Presidents &human beings!Deal with the facts lady!

Let me assure you, the DNC hack wasn’t even a hack. It was an insider with a memory stick. I know this because I know who did it and why. Special Counsel Mueller is not interested in my evidence. My lawyers wrote to him twice. He never replied. 360 pounds!
…
Good night

@WashTimes Do your job.  Remember who you represent and put them first. Hold the hearings, senators!
@BarackObama
#Liar #stfu #flipflop #askJoe

RT"@BarackObama (@POTUS' #SCOTUSnominee, Chief Judge #MerrickGarland, mj/#DoYourJob   ./.)
@WashTimes and there is no mandate to vote now. Its congress decision.
@POTUS To connect more people and more countries here you are...

PLEASE! You do the math. help on new items of scale models of domestic cars in my collection. SB 4276310010591586
@WashTimes OBAMA SUPPORTS ELECTRONIC HARASSMENT! OBAMA IS A LYING DRUG DEALING THIEF! SAVE THE TIs!
@WashTimes END ELECTRONIC TORTURE! OBAMA THE  MURDER! OBAMA USES ELECTRONICS TO TARGET INDIVIDUALS! FREE TO TIs!
@WashTimes Forget it!!
why is this not "contempt of the constitution"? Supreme Court should hold Congress in contempt
@WashTimes there is also no mandate to consider someone just because president wishes it.
Right on, @SenatorLeahy! The Congressional GOP's cynical anti-Obama political games are DISGRACEFUL...they have no shame!
@WashTimes Really? Talk to your @SenatorReid what goes around comes around. Republicans are in charge now. Eat what HR fed us 
NotEverHappeningYouReapWhatYouSow
I'm sorry it doesn't appear the final creep factor will be executed before your departure.  Perhaps Fembot Hillary can do it.
@WashTimes Totally agree.
@WashTimes THEY WILL PAY DEARLY IN NOVEMBER!
Oh my God. Judge Garland! Yes, I remember him.
Funny I thought we just call it the #Biden rule these days
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump  @GOP   show me where a time frame must be followed.
why is Mitch the obstructionist allowed to halt the US government
@WashTimes No liberal Judge Period!!!!
GOP attacking Constitution, aiding America's enemies.  Deplorable.
#ihateamericanpolice
@WashTimes 3.1 billion dollars help for Israel???? Really??? Shame on you Mr.President
- get rid of sanctuary cities if u concerned about the law
tpp is bad for governments who want to protect their own people from corrupt companies. Stop supporting it
@WashTimes not your ti,etc  Obama is not the deciding factor
Protect democracy ? Okay get out of the oval and go back to Kenya.
you had your chances to nominate a #WhiteGuy #MilC2

@WashTimes o aww
@WashTimes Keep pushing POTUS.U'll get confirmation b4 U go.Any sweeping exec actions on sentencing for non-violent offenders?
Come on Obama, let's hear your support for the kid who pointed a gun at the cops and was shot dead.
He forgets there is no mandate to have a Congressional hearing in Article II either. What about Zika? Who has been blocking it?
- The Republicans are a law unto themselves. They need to move outside of the U.S. or get out of office if they can't obey laws
why aren't u on the golf course? Ur a pathetic potus, shameful
#BidenRule
@plz sir contact me
"The economy has improved greatly. Thank-you Obama." Narcissism anyone?
@WashTimes typical  Rebuplicans, putting party 1st and our country a distant 4th #shameful
There also isn't a set timeline for the process either. Don't expect people you have spent you're presidency disrespecting
to want to do things to make you happy
@WashTimes  no more refugees and illegal aliens.....
@WashTimes There isn't any requirement for hearings or any timeline for Senate action on this in article II either.
@WashTimes i wish to meet president Barack Obama.
yo Barack lets kick it when you are done being Pres. w @TheBlackSheriff
Please Mr.President perdon him. Edward Snowden is a hero not a traitor
Why don't u just use an executive order and appointed Garland to the Supreme Court!
HELL NO!!!!  you and your compatriots have done enough damage.  Sit down and shut up.
Constitution Day.. gotta love the gov't has the balls to celebrate this after the shit they've done to violate it. ;)
whatever  you should be collecting moving boxes No disrespect

GREAT JOB SIR.
Screw you and the horse you rode in on:  https://youtu.be/cZlzhULrJC0   Words from your VP TO LIVE BY.
nothing in article 11 calls for 9 justices
Do something about what's going on at DAPL & just maybe I'll believe you. Actions already taken have done nothing. #NoDAPL
Sen. Leahy reminds me of my father
@WashTimes  OBAMA USES RADIO WAVES TO SEXUALLY MOLEST CHILDREN! THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ATTACKS ARE DIRECTED AT THEIR ANUSES!
@WashTimes what about all the cases that are going without a fair hearing Americans?
trump has put people to work and built more jobs than you & Washington DC ever could.
prohibition does not regulate, prohibition kills. #EndTheDrugWar #EndTheLies #Liberty #LegalizeIt #EndGovtProfiteering
..but they can't overturn the stuff you did the last eight years if they don't manipulate a judge of their own onto the SC. #GL
@WashTimes They've done NOTHING!.. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
@WashTimes you are still our President! Can u somehow make this elected buncha slackers do their jobs 4 which they r paid big $
Ain't going to happen, Bam. Even your daughters no longer respect U.
hi iam jacksom i go put you in escada
@WashTimes fidem.scientam.labor. http://faith.knowledge.work . hillary's arms in the battle...
I am 100% behind you, Mr. President.
"Protecting our democracy" is a farce!
There is no such thing as "democracy" and never has been, and ya' ain't doing so!
.@BarackObama "Quack"
What democracy?  The USA is a republic. This country/system is not a democracy and it has never been. We're more like Cuba!
They will get a fair shake when Trump wins!! #MAGA @realDonaldTrump
OMG read Colin Powell's emails about Bill and Hilary Clinton. If any of you vote for her, YOUR the laughing stock. 
@WashTimes Can you show me where in the Constitution it says, "pen and phone"?
Just tell people Hillary's considering either you or @MichelleObama instead of Judge Garland - see if they don't jump.
Ha sido exitoso para los EE.UU., y solo por eso mencionamos la aportación mexicana tan oportuna y eficiente, ¡pedimos paz!
@WashTimes you know it.
ANY TYRANNY MAY HAVE OTHER NAME,
MORE CAN BE TRUMP. PLEASE SEE MY TWITTER, IAM BARACK OBAMA II, AND HILLARY @HillaryClinton ,
ain't happening.
Desconocer que en la fruticultura de súbito ¡toda la fresa o manzana gritan "urge el corte"... ¿y sin mano de obra suficiente?
fucking do your job congress!! Anyone else would be fired!
You should be blocked on everything you want. You are just abusing your power and you should have been impeached by now.
@WashTimes can that be possible? And if so, what are the near miss consequences for Americans?
NO!!!
Republicans are obstructionist and should be voted out of office. All the Alt-Right republicans vote out!
I agree.Continue to take the fight to the republicans who fight against what is right in America!
@WashTimes how ever there is an amendment forbaying More then 2 terms per president.
plez stop killing in #baluchistan_innocent
