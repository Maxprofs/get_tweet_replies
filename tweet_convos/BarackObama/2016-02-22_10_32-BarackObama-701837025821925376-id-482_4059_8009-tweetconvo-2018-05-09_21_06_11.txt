@BarackObama @BWMudd That Sir would depend on what job you wish them to do. Wouldn't it???
@KarenKazKubala No idea what that even means.
@BWMudd Simple. If you want a liberal dem that will continue to destroy our country.. They should speed right through. However, if u don't!!
@KarenKazKubala Wow. You don't read much, do you?
@BWMudd I'm especially found of the Constitution, The D.O.I. And the bill of Rights!!
@KarenKazKubala Honestly, I would prefer if you unfollowed me. I don't want people to think you & I have anything in common.
@BWMudd Although i find it funny that you would retweet politics and then get mad when someone disagrees with your view!
@KarenKazKubala Only when it's a hypocritical nonsensical view.
like you did with Alito? @BarackObama
@lamblock @BarackObama difference being gNop doesn't  even want hearings.  Alito's approved in 3 months.
tell that to Miguel Estrada and Janice Rogers Brown @SJMLsl @BarackObama
@lamblock @BarackObama not SCOTUS nom.  How many appointments being blocked by gNop right now.  100, 200?
so it's ok to politicize other parts of the judiciary. sweet, thanks for admitting that @SJMLsl @BarackObama
@lamblock you brought up other's  so only bad when D do but okay if gNop does got it
@BarackObama Funny that! Isn't siding with the Remain in Europe europhiles playing politics Mr President!
@BarackObama that's right Barack you tell em #barackobama
@BarackObama @randyprine

Dear President Obama,

Usually, you are a fast learner.Take the next, indicated step, as the Senate will not act.
@BarackObama #do your job
@BarackObama c'mon, you know why they won't accept any nominee from you. They spent a lot getting their SC just how they want it.
@BarackObama @wordjones says the once senator who did exactly that & had every right to do so. Congress has the right to filibuster.
@BarackObama where are the nominees
@BarackObama What they are doing is outrageous. The president has taken measures with authenticity & integrity so far and it has to go on.
@BarackObama i dont know if u r barackobama but i wish u could be our permanent president
@BarackObama And you really did your job perfectly! By killing millions of Iraqi innocence people
#killer
@BarackObama @princessomuch 
My question for Mitch; Why are you more important than the job of a SCOTUS justice.
@BarackObama of course, when the Dem wins the WH and the Senate, you could be the new Justice! Wouldn't that drive them WILD!
@BarackObama you deserve a 3rd term Barack #best President ever
@BarackObama no
@BarackObama Keep the faith Mr. President.
@BarackObama do not elect any one who will not fulfill their job requirements SENATORS
@BarackObama Joe Biden pulled the same thing on George Bush many years ago.#heightofhypocrisy
@BarackObama Why not? You have been playing games with the people of America for the last 7 years. Time to drink your own cool aid. @nytimes
@BarackObama You should not play games either.
@BarackObama дебил
@BarackObama @Dan800twice http://www.mediaite.com/online/obama-was-against-supreme-court-filibusters-while-he-was-for-them/ …

@BarackObama

@BarackObama I agree, nothing about this senate surprises me.  It started in January 2009!
@BarackObama  Well said, Mr President.
@BarackObama  I'm with you!
@BarackObama @UnmiserableCLE they also shouldn't rush confirm a candidate without properly interviewing them
.@BarackObama Why would they start NOW? Senate GOP members have done everything in their power to challenge progress since 2008! #PartyOfNo
@BarackObama yeah don't vote while he is there, give them the same treatment they did to bush
@BarackObama @Messina2012  I am listening to what Biden, Schumer and a 2/3 term Ex Senator have said about Supreme Court in the past.
@BarackObama how quickly you forget your own messiah's actions.  #losers #puppetstoobama
@BarackObama They play games with EVERYTHING IMPORTANT!!
@barackobama ummm... Are you sure?
@BarackObama in most cases I've been pro limited presidential time. Not in your case.
@BarackObama They haven't been doing their job for 7 yrs now. Why would they change now?  @TheTawniest
@BarackObama agreed Mr. President. Please push forward.
@BarackObama  I remember you once balking President Bush from making the same choice......hmmmmm
@BarackObama how about looking @FreeStevenAvery in those last 300 days!
@BarackObama perhaps they learned from you and the dems?
@BarackObama But mr. president help us in Africa to remove the Dictators. It's too much to bear now.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @USSenateUpdate to ALL senators, #DoYourJob and start proceeding with new new SCOTUS appointee from POTUS! Quit being childish!
@BarackObama Love u Barack!! No matter the outcome.
@BarackObama They are committing political suicide. Might be the final nail in their coffin.
@BarackObama.  How bout suggesting/suing that the Supreme Court rule on the need for timely hearings and confirmation for their empty seat?
@BarackObama u DIDN'T pay ur respect @ his funeral. U do it for others but not for a man that protects that constitution unlike u, u destroy
@BarackObama Yet it's frowned upon for a man like Donald Trump to be in office because he wants fairness not helping-out-poorness #obama :(
@BarackObama  I am behind you all the way.
@BarackObama Senate do your Job
@BarackObama @harper I would, but I live in DC and don't have a vote.
@BarackObama   Let's Move On!!  It's the Pres constitutional obligation to fill the Supreme Court vacancy so the court can fully function!!
@BarackObama amen!
@BarackObama You should stop telling the world that APPOINT Justices. You do not. You nominate for Senate approval. It's up to America.
@BarackObama work more hard bama
@BarackObama 呢你就把参议院解散了

@BarackObama But it's fun to play games with people!
@BarackObama

@BarackObama #DoYourJob Conservative Senate, and put a super fucking liberal in the Supreme court... they are doing their job.
@BarackObama 
P ax
@BarackObama you would do great service going back to the Senate and lead the floor of jammed palace. Remember Pres. Jackson!!
@BarackObama remember an average is an average, what were the longest and shortest periods?
@BarackObama is that the frying pan calling the kettle black
@BarackObama did you say that when senator schumer said no bush appointees or when you advocated for blocking bush's appointment?
@BarackObama that's really bad wishbone their was something you could do about that
@BarackObama should not play political games with our country.
@BarackObama but when you were in the Senate didn't YOU play political games with the Supreme Court?
@BarackObama #senate no pay no work
@BarackObama #LINKHADNOPANTSASAKID

@BarackObama 我猜你不懂中文
@BarackObama   Why not. The President has been doing that for seven years.
@BarackObama you would know about political games #lameduck #dontworrytrumpwillsaveus
@BarackObama the Senate should  confirm a reasonable nominee. Mr. President do your job and nominate an acceptable candidate.
@BarackObama I tried thislast night and it would not register my name without a donation.
@BarackObama They are doing their job, it is called checks and balances
@BarackObama Love you from Argentina, I waiting for you
@BarackObama @mattmartella As long as the nominee will defend freedom and constitution - unlike past Obama appointees
@BarackObama perhaps you should do your OWN job for a change. PROTECT AMERICANS FIRST!
@BarackObama I intend totell them to wait.  Not to support u our lame nominations.  You've done too much damage as it is.
@BarackObama it treap over.
@BarackObama  You ARE kidding. Your "fundamental transformation of America" is about to be stopped dead in its tracks.
@BarackObama Mr President will do his job, however the Senate I'll fight him for everything as they have in the past and not do their job
@BarackObama @JoeBiden POTUS should talk to his VP about the same issue in 1992. Typical democrat hypocrites -- do as I say, not as I do.
@BarackObama why don't you resign?
