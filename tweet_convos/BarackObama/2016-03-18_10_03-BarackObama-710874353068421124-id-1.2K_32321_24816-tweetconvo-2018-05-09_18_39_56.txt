absolutely!!!!
@DebbiePeter3 he deserved it long ago
@NancyLeeGrahn you are going to have to do it...stop being so nice! It doesn't win with these guys!
who was that guy who once said elections have consequences?  Hmm. i an sure it will come to me eventually
It has to border on criminal that this is being blocked.
Mr. Garland, So sorry parts of our democracy doesn't work.They fought Obama at every turn. SAD.
Is this a thing where we can contact our reps for?
you must appoint judge Garland to the court Jan 3rd. Rules have changed, this is the long game.
@peprally do the appointment during recess
Yes,Sir he does.
If he's a leftist and in opposition to Constitutional Originalism, then why should Conservatives/Libertarians?
You leftists don't believe in your own Constitution. You don't know how to read it/interpret it properly
you like Garland. That's enough for me not to.
#ByeFelicia
A good rule of thumb is; If obama endorses them, they are all for the 1%ers.
@rubymagic Miss you sir! Hope you are getting rest on your vacation 
If they won’t do their jobs, 1) Do it for them - just appoint him 2) Dock their pay 3) Deny them benefits for life. #DoYourJob
Just appoint him already!  They won't treat your legacy any better if you don't.
"Unprecedented" has been the GOP byword throughout your presidency.
Mitch McConnell stole this SCOTUS seat. There are no words to describe how loathsome is @SenateMajLdr.
We will remember.
Recess appointment. Time for you to play hardball.
@SophiaBush go away
@BarackObama Thank you for working so hard for what it right!
@ShawGynan what has he worked on that is right or fair or not breaking current laws?
Thank you, President Obama, for health care for millions, for marriage equality, for a strong economy, for making America proud!
all ppl should be protected & we aren't, our economy is horrible, he has done nothing & HC will be no different

Sorry Obama. They failed you.
Confirm him in recess. It is your right. We are all behind you!
Republicans have no work ethic &they certainly aren't beholden to the country.
I know U-r and that's why I love you 
. Yes Yes we've asked, tweeted, retweeted, and signed petitions.  Please make this happen!
so how about them recess appointments?
How about if you get a backbone, grow a pair, and appoint #Garland. Do something daring. For once. You're running out of time.
Mr. @BarackObama You really should have been & should be fighting harder than this. @NancyLeeGrahn
To Dems: Trump cannot elect a single nominee for judge until Garland is appointed to the supreme court.
Since the republicans are just making up the law, you could do the same and bypass 'em.
@DefraudTheVote Yes and he should do it January 3.2017!Even if Garland is in till dec 2017! Article II, Sec 2 which sure u know
@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems #We the citizens of the US ask you to be bipartisan and #DoYourJob
Go for the recess appointment, Barry. When they go low, we go high. But when they pull a knife, we pull a gun. #thechicagoway
Indeed!Judge Merrick Garland deserves the vacant seat in the US Supreme Court as constitutionally nominated by you!

@OrlandoBuzana @nicogimb go fuck yourself
@adrianhei @nicogimb thank you! 
@BarackObama @SeedyRoads Right after you POTUS retract your #BernieSanders should concede BULLSHIT! Or: Wall Street has you deep in pocket?
@vansopinion8ted @BarackObama @SeedyRoads except he didnt say that
@bereasonable2 @BarackObama @SeedyRoads He stopped short of saying that. No need to say when telling those $$$ gathered to back the warhawk
@vansopinion8ted @BarackObama @SeedyRoads yes, he did stop short hes looking at the math. The next few primaries will tell the story
@bereasonable2 @BarackObama @SeedyRoads HE has bully pulpit & should either endorse or STFU. If GWB had of said same Dems would've freaked
@vansopinion8ted @BarackObama @SeedyRoads relax
@bereasonable2 @BarackObama @SeedyRoads Let me be clear as our X PM used to say: I can relax & tweet truth, see lies as lies, research facts
@vansopinion8ted @BarackObama @SeedyRoads PM? You're not even American? what are you getting so bent out of shape for? the process will work

@mauromag1 WGAF
@EricMcCormack Do the recess appointment for Merrick Garland, Mr. President. On the surface, it really seems that simple.
@EricMcCormack The POTUS has the power to appoint him and Obama should do his job. Senate has waived their rights
@EricMcCormack Yes, please
I guess 2/3 don't agree huh
Thank you Mr. President. You are the best we've had since I started voting 40 years ago.
Also,@HillaryClinton won!!.RU hacked our elect to get it's orange narcissist puppet elected.#TrumpCheatedAndWon!!
@TheKrain nah. Dems blocked Bush in lame Duck session. Were warned then about precedent. Shouldnt abuse power when u have it.
You should do your job and support the recount effort also #AuditTheVote b/c u know damn well,RU hacked our elec.
@ApocalypticaNow 
Just push him through. I herd u can with out hearing. See what gop says. Defiant since they wont do job.
@Rosie ummm...NO. The #dems would allow it under a #republican so why now?
I among millions have signed a petition that you appoint him. Congress has waived their constitutional right by not voting.
1: Nobody who retweets this is actually qualified to know.  2: Avoid "deserve"; it leads to dark places.
hi prez, are you going to appoint him before you leave us? We need him.
just do it... and mercy on us all when you do...
@Rosie LOL. Aint gonna happen. Commie tears are so so SWEET!
I believe the Standing Rock water protectors deserve fair consideration. Why don't you?
@marcorubio @SpeakerRyan @SenWarren @SenSanders Speaker u do not have mandate, ur lack of leadership is astounding #popularvote
@marcorubio @SpeakerRyan @SenWarren @CBSNews Listen!! Conserve Court = $$$ in politics & guns everywhere
@marcorubio @SpeakerRyan @SenWarren Senate fails U.S.through obfuscation & blame! Define Leadership?
@IAMANITABAKER so unfortunate as Trump and his republicans won't vote for him God has something else in store for u Garland
He's an activist judge, so no. Use one of @realDonaldTrump picks. And #MAGA
I absolutely believe that Merrick Garland deserves a hearing. #DoYourJob
@AndyRichter Obama is out of office in two months no way in hell he gets to ruin our country anymore
We have a president who can't say Islamic terror or admit that our law enforcement being slaughtered is a crisis
@DonCheadle 
As your last act in power please destroy the flyover states. Nuclear, poison whatever, really #MAG4once
and if i dont belive that what should i do? kick you in the nuts?
Mr. President how about do your job and stop the pipeline and those incident peaceful protesters!!! #NoDAPL
@Rosie lol. It's over!

@jfreewright just appoint him. The year we would have could be crucial.
@ToniTagliarino Treason in defense of party.
no way , he is never going to be on SCOTUS period.
@smelton isn't it in the law, you can appoint him if congress will not do their jobs? If it is, Appoint him...end of story...js
@hiebert_llisa
The Judge Merrick Garland Deserves fair Vote
- YAY B.O.! Rationality is good; Others have abridged it for EIGHT years. May the best of the USA serve our future = H.C./B.S.!
xYes, Judge Merrick  Garland deserves a hearing.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama When President Clinton puts your name forward for #SCOTUSnominee I'll be even happier!
#SecondJob
@BarackObama @gmcgovern101 yea do your job
@BarackObama enen
@BarackObama @mikefulky Democrats feign outrage after doing the same thing. Don't lecture us about doing the job.
@BarackObama @woollensocks  Sure he does. But if they'd rather risk a Sanders nomination later, that's fine too!
@BarackObama @SgyYogarajah NOT GOOD OF THE SENATE, DELAYING DOING THEIR JOB AT THE RIGHT TIME. Silent denial not the right act of Greatness
@BarackObama sir ji you are great leader  of world
@BarackObama I believe judge  Merrick Garland deserves a fair consideration
@BarackObama nope, did you see I didn't say "sir"?
@BarackObama @SenFeinstein nope
@BarackObama Yes we do. I heard Ron Johnson state he'll abdicate his constitutional duty of Advise and Consent on  Sundays feeding trough
@sjungling Must have been a glitch.
@BarackObama @JoshMalina Says the man who filibustered two Supreme Court nominees. Can't say I'm moved by his sudden desire for "fair".
@BarackObama Why are the Republicans afraid?  They shouldn't be scaredy cats and give Judge Garland a hearing.
@BarackObama he completely rejects one amendment. He doesn't deserve a hearing.
@BarackObama Good choice
@BarackObama @citizensrock I don't agree with him being nominated...YOU played it safe AGAIN!!!
@BarackObama Hang in there Sir!!!They r Assholes!!! We Love You!!!
@BarackObama @fonda_mae 
well mr. president, the insidious word "fair" makes me question the possibility of fairness...
@BarackObama @jilevin I do, but frankly want the Democrats to win the Presidency and the Senate so someone more liberal is appointed.
@BarackObama We are with you about this #DoYourJob Senate. it's so rude and unAmerican. This is still America, right? Trump,Sanders, WHAT?
@BarackObama we need help as soon as possible to Congo Brazzaville I'm OFA member
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Yes I think he does and you were so smart to pick him
@BarackObama yes I do believe he deserves full consideration
@BarackObama , yes
@BarackObama @ArtKen nope he doesn't the next president will decide that
@BarackObama  NO!!!
@BarackObama #DoYourJob and look at real poll numbers!  2/3? Where? Mars? Your a hypocrite!

@BarackObama And for the record I am a dem who voted for you twice but your shady hypercritical behavior is making me rethink my stance

@BarackObama @ioumail  Marit Garland  is a tool of the NWO. Wake up!
@BarackObama It's not about Garland or what he "deserves." It's about you, despite a term limit, making decisions with decades-long impact.
@BarackObama Yes!! Do your job!!
@BarackObama  yes I support President Obama 's choice
@BarackObama He sides too much with law enforcement. Please nominate a real liberal or progressive since the GOP will block it anyway!
