Why don't you stop the senseless violence that truly is the problem of one of the world's most dangerous places?!
And by the way  St. Louis, Missouri the most dangerous place in the United States.
And why is St Louis so dangerous? Sorry I thought Chicago was as weekend before last, 39 shot,7-8 killed in gang violence.give or take a few
Or even why they they started it. Or you just repeating what people say.
And sadly it's black on black mostly. Where's their black mayor? Or the first black Pres who is from there on all this?They never discuss it
Come on if Obama focus on all African-American problems people who of had a fit. Plus everything he tried to do in office was a fight.
My biggest issue w Obama is that one he used the race card Everytime he opened his mouth. Two, he's a mix like your nephew but he never once
That just because you are mixed people don't necessary see you as mixed. Obama just looks like a light skinned black man. You can't tell me
go ahead
Welcome back,
Thanks Very much.. @LateefMughal @BarackObama
thank you for great speech of hope .
the only entity that benefit from min. Wage increases is the government.  By increasing of taxable incomem
Donald Trump all the way
this action is destroying small businesses.
Raise MinWage so small Business's close down Bc they can't afford it leaving big business's around to profit! #ShopLocal 
CHICAGO IS CRIME CENTRAL & SOME PLACE I WILL NEVER VISIT ! RAISING WAGE TO 15$ WILL HURT A LOT OF BUSINESSES. STOP THE THUGS
if that's great there how come the coal mines are being shut down and people loosing their jobs in WV???

Fight for the people dying in the streets! It's your hometown, fix it!
Raising the minimum wage and ignoring the highest murder rates in the country smart plan
Not now! US is passed bankruptcy and your responsible for most of our problems. You have no legacy!
do you live in a box? Or a doomsday shelter. Brainwashed by that radio. You need to get out more smell the air.
Your like Hillary "Don't have a clue" . See a doctor!
unless you're @HillaryClinton, then it's pie in the sky.

YEAH YOU ! ,  http://easycolorexpress.com 
You always want to pay half assed workers with the dollars of the hard worker. Obama...you suck!!
wouldn't it better to let citizens of Chicago to have arms to protect themselves so they can hold those jobs safely?
anxious to see how much that takes a bite out of the horrendous crime  #'s in that bastion of liberal policies
Yep now if we could just get them to stop killing each other
I have fought with no positive outcome. Must we die first
if we slowed down the illegal a lien work force everyone's wages would rise
@davidplouffe @travisk 
Genuine question how does #RaiseTheWage  help the ever increasing numbers of 'gig' economy workers?
@BarackObama
Thanks to all those who made it a gun safe city. The murder rate has never been higher
well the only problem with that is we will be more poor by raising it because the wage cannot keep pace with the cost of living
@BarackObama
YEAH YOU ! ,  http://easycolorexpress.com 
hi Obama. You so cute.
We need to do the same in California #raisethewage
WHAT ABOUT THE 4-6 MURDERS EVERY DAY IN CHICAGO ??
sir it's time we all differentiate between good Islam and bad Islam followers &msg must come from all world leader unitedly.
“YES, WE NEED ACTION” http://easycolorexpress.com 
try stopping the Chicago CRIME!
哈哈
no it don't you people ain't worst 3 dollar a hour I know
Let see if the media tells us how many lost there jobs afterwords Mr. Potato-head!
that's true....I love your leadership, please follow me Mr. President
you the man Barry!
@BarackObama
you need to help us who have made ONE mistake in our lives get a good job... #changethelaws #weneedjobstoo
if Americans want a hirer wage than get an education or work for a promotion. Raising minimum wage only eliminates jobs
We Got your "freedom from Frustration", http://easycolorexpress.com 
and consumers will pay the price when businesses have to charge us more to cover paying unqualified employees more. Thanks
OK what about Texas,its hell living off this shit to.
now do something about the 1000+ deaths so far because of gun control. Release the people to protect themselves and fight back!
sure…Then the employers will go elsewhere & they will be without work. Dont expect you to understand that… #SpecialKindOfStupid
follow me please!!!
Earning raises is the right thing to do.
nice.
While fast food begins automating and deploying robots.  Than it's bye bye jobs Barry and hello $0.00 per hour.
you're the best..we're going to miss you when your gone!!
- Now all the thugs can afford their guns the old fashioned way. Out of the back of a van. See. You are changing America.
hola caracola
How about stop the killing.
دعبل
yes it is
McCain is "Directly Responsible" for ISIShttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzV9bjMg2ZU
if I were president, I'd value every question with 100 percent of my space and time.
hampering free markets and boosting the cost of everyday goods for hard working families is short-sighted stupidity.
YEAH YOU ! ,  http://easycolorexpress.com 
Hope it happens in all states.
when companies pay more, they raise prices. So people pay more at the register.
yes.
BO! Be K man & know all the suffering will end! New World is Near! This is The Lords world & He is LOVE!
Satan Obama
let's see how proud you will be when inflation triples because of stupid wage hike
good~
all it does is make everything more expensive
Great!
yeah this passed in oregon and every state it passes in the cost of living will rise. Not right away but it will go up
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE MUST PAID ALONG WAGES AT $15.00 PER HOUR ACTUALLY FOR THE OWNER IS PAYING APROXIMANTLY $ 30.00/ HOUR .
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PUSHING HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES KNOWING THIS WIPE OUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. 8 HOURS x 30.00=$240.00 PER EMPLOYEE
,$30.00/ HOUR x 40 HOURS WORKED= $ 1,200.00 PER WEEK PER EMPLOYEE x 40 EMPLOYEES =$48,000.00 PER MONTH. SMALL BUSINES WILL FAIL
and now we just need to stop the crime and daily shootings.
, I wanted to get a pay raise when I had no job... I got a great job now & student debt...can I get a raise to help w/ my loans?
while simultaneously boosting unemployment, especially in the youth
- San Diego voters also approved a minimum wage raise! It will be implemented quicker than the state's thanks to @ToddGloria
/ GOOD MORNING / NIGHT SIR.  HAVE A NICE WEEK END DAY SIR. GOD HANUMAN BLESS U ALL.
I will miss you.

Lol, too bad they'll just raise prices to compensate.
“LISTEN TO US” http://easycolorexpress.com 
Can we raise the minimum wage to $60? It will make video games way more affordable. Maybe $70 incase of day one DLC.
@sardnas51 liar
and congrats for ending all the gun violence in Chicago...oh yeah, that didn't work out for you did it?
HaHaHaHaYeah Right hi enlighten ourself on Economics
I hard working too?
@realDonaldTrump Unintended consequences, higher wages means they no longer qualify for free housing and food stamps brilliant
watch the quality of service go down as unemployment goes up #WendysKiosks
how about you boost your wage by working hard and getting off your rear. That's what I did and continue to do. #
and soon you'll see the cost of living go up even more. I bet the poor were duped into think it would create a job for them.
Yeah
How many Jobs will be lost as companies adjust their headcount to maintain their profitability
now 50% of them will be out of a job and collecting unemployment. #EpicFail
nice
Please do post nice things like that to improve ratings that have fallen bad from endorsing someone under criminal investig
and #TPP also but int ratings are going up in a jealous world delighted at America's slide down
I boosted my paycheck by getting a better job and so did everyone else I know. 
That's actually how it's supposed to work.
how about murder rate
ه
Yes. Like #ACA, right thing to do, and at right amount, too, nationally. But, WE MUST deal w/ #CostOfLiving b4 another. YK
yet $4.25 for PR's youth?
wage increases are awesome. Help us stop the violence.
problem is "hardworking" is incorrect.  Entitled is more correct
what a valuable support, it's a good lesson for us , thank you Mr President
nope---it's not---wrong again PBO---what do you think will happen here? Some peeps will be let go... #yaycommunism!
CHICAGO MUSIC  CONTROVERSY! Listen to UNTITLED.   Gemini sample.... Hard uplifting....Ghetto praise...
he's talking about you,  @rocchicago y'all!
wrong
so doing the right thing you should give yours back for you don't do a damn thing.
you forgot to say to try and not get shot this weekend
the reptillian scheme is becoming clear
oh no!  Everyone is going to lose their jobs now! 
Apparently they didn't  teach you economics in college or law school.
but unfortunately they are killing black on black crime, raising the wage is not going to help
True but when a loaf of bread cost 2 times more what's the point of getting paid more?
It's definitely a start, but we've needed a pay raise for many years now. Please keep fighting for $15 an hour. Thank you!
so should the prez set the cost of goods and services too? If he wants to dictate cost of employees why not COGS
pickup an economic book
Que bom Sr. Presidente
kindly follow back Mr President! Cheers!
protecting Americans from terrorists is the right thing to do!

minimal skills=min wage. GOVT has no place in fair comp for one's labor/service in free-market capitalism.
Look at what it does in 1958 gas was $.25/gal then govt with taxes, and wage raises, we were up to $5.00/gal WHY Govt. greed
has does that not result in necessary job cuts for hard working Americans?
@ChicagosMayor  Dobrze by się stało żeby Pan dalej był Prezydentem USA. Pozdrawiam serdecznie wszystkich.
