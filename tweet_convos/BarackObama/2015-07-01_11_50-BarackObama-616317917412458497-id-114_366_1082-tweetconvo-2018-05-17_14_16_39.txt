@BarackObama Did it cost less freedom and quality of care than you expected? #lowexpectations
@BarackObama if you could see this fantastic! I love you you have done so much for us but some people don't see that. Thanks for being there
@BarackObama @joejsully Don't give us this #ACAWorks stuff. It's #Obamacare & a huge success. 
& you signed your name to it! :)
@BarackObama How about a conversation about how it has flopped and negatively affected people? #ACACostsUs #ACAFlopped Have 1 w/o other? bad
@BarackObama Remind me again how much the taxpayers paid for a website? #ObamaLies

@EnvyMeGreatly @BarackObama Our kids r 'merchandise' 2 government. Our kids, our tax dollars=job security for endless people. #OpExposeCPS
@EnvyMeGreatly @BarackObama #OMB #HHS? Hashtags I'm not familiar with. It is only escalating at alarming rate. Nobody taking accountability.
@BarackObama #ACAworks #NoItDoesnt
“@BarackObama: "Not only has the law worked better than expected ... but it's ended up costing less than people expected." —President Obama
@BarackObama - UNAFFORDABLE CARE WILL TAKE US UNDER...We will be Greece / Puerto Rico soon - except for wealthy, like BO
@BarackObama wrong again fool.
@BarackObama Get off the crack pipe!
@BarackObama not in my house Mr. OBAMA.  Methinks you are delusional.
@BarackObama he either is knowingly lying or he is in such a bubble he is clueless.
@BarackObama BS, my ins now does not allow payment for any vaccine.  We now have to ;pay full price for preventative care, thanks Mr. Pres
@BarackObama Plan I can afford is $400/mth w/ $5k deductible per person.Son has $3300+ so far this year :( It needs to be better #ACAWorks
@BarackObama So you expected premiums to go up higher than more than double and deductibles to go through the roof?
@BarackObama I'm almost amazed people will listen to you tell lies this big, but then I remember they voted for you. #obamacare #ACAWorks
@BarackObama I don't think you ever gave up smoking weed, did you?
@BarackObama american health care is the most expensive in the world. Please being down health care costs by 50%
@BarackObama Not everyone would admit that to be true but it has worked well!  I hope your predecessor agrees and continues the progress
@BarackObama if its so great why arent you,congress and judicial branch enrolled in the health care program.
.@BarackObama So true. @FoxNews said my premiums would triple, but they only DOUBLED instead. #ImSavingSoMuchMoney #ACAWorks
@BarackObama as if!! Counting Black budget aswell???
@BarackObama quantifiably, demonstrably, undeniably FALSE. You are a bloody sociopath. #ACAWorks  #ACAHurts
@BarackObama Holy f@#$ing hell, you've got to be kidding. #imbecile #liar #PleaseSTFU #crapweasel #tcot
@BarackObama #educate #america #reschedule #medicalmarijuana #medicalmarijuana 50 states liberty and justice for all not just a few
@BarackObama Lol
@BarackObama you know what hasn't worked?  ensurance for the disabled!
@BarackObama Did it ever occur 2 you 21 allow HC industry 2 adjust taxable income in exchange 4 care of those in need ?
@BarackObama The only sensible fix 4 H'CARE is to pay the HC Industry direct with Gov doing FDIC type backup. 100% of HC $.  Care 4 life.
@BarackObama are you high?
@BarackObama My premiums have gone up 65% since ACA passed. All you've done is add cost & lie to us about how great it is.  ARE YOU ON IT ?
@BarackObama so what's good with that cash for us generation of slave babies jews got money native Americans where our shit???
@BarackObama I am thrilled for those whom it worked for however when you reach an age without kids, still being punished.#MiddleClassTaxed
@BarackObama yeah, if "less" actually meant "more"...
@BarackObama President lies - the real costs don't kick in yet.The plan bankrupts America and lowers healthcare quality after next wave.
@BarackObama . . . and, that really pisses off those who have been trying to undermine the Law since Day One!
@BarackObama yes, "wisdom" from the same Prez who said, "I ve now been in 57 states? I think one left to go?" #tcot
@BarackObama "Lies, damned lies, and statistics"
@BarackObama #InternationalJokeDay
@BarackObama Good job! Good man!
@BarackObama fudge.
@BarackObama I can only imagine having diabetes with no healthcare coverage, has to be horrible. The world is a better place because of you.
.@BarackObama if #obamacare it so good and less expensive, why doesn't the political class enroll & buy into it. Are you better than thee.
@BarackObama Show some figures and stop talking! #Truth
@BarackObama Not me.  Its a tax. So, I'm bending over and taking another government invasion up the financial rectum.
@BarackObama sorry for the haters/weirdos. Normal people know you're doing a great job!
@BarackObama yeah... The first year. It will only rise in cost.
@BarackObama what will it take to get health coverage for me and my family. Illnesses bark at my door. #Obamacare
@BarackObama You're lying again.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama  Executing  fine job for America!
@BarackObama So. We remember those who have transgressed its own red lines and actually legalized genocide in Syria.
@BarackObama unless you're middle class and your rates and deductibles increased by 400% - The ACA "works" for the poor and the rich
@BarackObama still sitting here with no healthcare
@BarackObama Hahahahahahahaha are you for real? I'm paying almost double for less coverage!
@BarackObama Hell Yeah
@BarackObama Not for me.  It just keeps going up
@BarackObama Who wins the Copa America for you?
@BarackObama @POTUS Will U be saying that after the projected Avg 35% increase in Premiums for Americans this year? Need more competition!
@BarackObama : like you said, they'll stop calling it "Obama" care soon. #ACAcoverage
@BarackObama So how do I address political issues regarding violations upon my civil liberty and get a legitimate answer and solution?
@BarackObama ya! health care costs are through the roof now, but at least everyone can have it now...

@deardear22 @BarackObama  I think you should ask him help African American and then they can invest in Africa like the Chinese and others
@FyahballKinte that sounds like a great idea but how many african american apart from opral are interested in Africa?
@deardear22 that's just the awareness I'm bringing  across. Honour your mother and father. And they've completely disowned Africa. # Most
