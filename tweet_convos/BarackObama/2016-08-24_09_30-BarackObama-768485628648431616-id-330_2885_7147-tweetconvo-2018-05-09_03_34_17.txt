@reclaimanglesea Got this one yet @resourcesforaus @brettahogan @csgguy2 #auspol @TheIPA
30MW at 30% availability, really is scraping bottom of the barrel
@APPropst if offshore wind farms are so effective, why haven't we invested more in them?
Seni seviyorum başkanım
@yolmassey @BarackObama @ifarmlife
JUST LIKE MARIA ALL WIND.WHAT A FART,AND STINKS TO
@nytimes  More realistically, we are in dire need of political change.  
#TrumpPence16
and kill endangered birds.
The clean energy revolution in US is in full swing and we at @DeepwaterWind are trying to do our part
-

welcome to the party #POTUS, #Australia's been there, done that and @generalelectric printed Tee Shirts.
the cost of wind power is 3dollars greater then my current provider. tell how many ways  wind power is better and prove it
now that twitter account on tourch browser is hacked again. i want2 say thank u 4 ur bill for maturnity leave
@NickCageII you could come visit me and we could see them 
omg 
this is literally from months ago lmfao
@nytimes who pays to replace them when salt water erodes them ir a hurricane blow them over? Saving money, doubt it.
@nytimes  targets govt hypocrits that fly in private jets, luxury SUV's, stay in pres suites in hotels & call it a charity
@nytimes 
All people will respect U,
IF
AMERICA
USE ITS SUPER TECHNOLOGY
TO REBUILD this world
N
Not as TROUBLE MAKER

BE TRUTH
@nytimes can't fight the changes to the climate only the technology that's used on a daily to affects it..smog..
I lived and still have businesses on this gem of an island. Thx for recognizing this critical project toward clean energy!
@nytimes very good
: Climate change is a grand hoax; without govt subsidys, it would vanish! A commie montra-- it will fail!
, who wants to look at the ocean and see windmills?
@nytimes 
Use your technology to HELP this world,
Rather than
Sending MILITARY EQUIPMENT
TO CTEATE WARS & UNPEACE

BE WORTHY U
In Denmark this solution is the already standard for many years...
@nytimes how long will it take for these windmills to become both economically practical to the company and area benefited?
.@BarackObama Rhode Island America's first offshore wind farm which will create #cleanenergy & fight #climatechange
I BEEN IN MY MINISTRY FOR FOUR MONTHS TO ALLOW ONES TO FEED ME ETC BUT GOT PLAYED ON SNAP BENIFITS
I WAS BORN IN HARVEY RAISED IN THE WINDY
not so simple &horrible idea. Not to mention in the middle of commercial fishing industry. #BadIdea
@nytimes 
USE REAL TRUTH & ACTION
IN PEACE
NOT
BY SENDING WAR SHIPS
MISSILE ETC
TO CREATE TENTION IN WARS
IN ASIA
WITH JAPAN
@nytimes Yay! Congrats!
@nytimes  why don't you talk about what Iran did to our ship yesterday.
@nytimes 资瓷你国新能源建设工作
@nytimes btw barry..anyone ever tell u u look like Alfred e. Neumann, the mascot 4 madmagazine.he'd do a better job as potustho
undoubtedly !
thanks for the tweet! I am so proud of my big brother! And it's so nice to have some positive news for a change!
Hey Mr. Pres, how's it going :D

The jury is out on the cost of the energy it provides and the life of the equipment in the salt water. Stay tuned!
@generalelectric here is a solar application that puts highways, roads, & streets to work.@SolarRoadways lots of energy & SE.
@generalelectric what a scam. Wind and solar are intermittent.
How's Wind farm going to power future when it only produces power 40% of the day - okay no power for 16Hrs a day the new norm!
good man family man.
@nytimes like 1 offshore wind farm is going to make ANY difference in climate change... to little... to late...
you are loved and will be soarly missed... and in due time,  by many Republicans.
My niece's wedding just took place in Rhode Island - two great happenings in the same place:  wind farm - wedding.
It's not moving.
.@BarackObama One tiny offshore windfarm, and many consessions to coastal drilling.. what a record.. #wind
, Honorable President, that is cool.
@nytimes great
are you coming out to see them?
新能源
How many birds will it kill?
@nytimes Rhode Island is rightful CT land. I demand it be gifted to us immediately.
Just how are these geographically and technically remote sea-bound wind farms going to be serviced?
freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do.remitted back to the United States, because I do not get a dime.
you are in our hearts keep fighting for #climatechange
@ClimateGuy1973 @Julia_Isabel84 @MegMurrayMusic
It looks very interesting.
Same bs as Canada. Get ready for hydro created poor.
@nytimes wow Mr. President I love keep it up Mr. President
Where are the wave motion powered generators? Use all alternative power sources, solar, wind, geothermal & alternative sources.
@nytimes This, I like. I once wanted to work installing windmills for renewable energy but 7 years ago not much opportunity
now after i typed on this today. touch browser crashed buy i am back on line this evening.
I hope they can withstand the rising shoreline!
Extremely proud of this, and excited to be representing the small wind industry in the great United States of America!
Proud to be an American Company, and proud to represent within this industry!
@nytimes then the last bastion of true freedom turns down! Shame...
A great President MR Barack Hussein Obama II, with steps victorious, having the responsibility, did the bridge of wisdom!

come visit the site. We will make you the best lobster roll you have ever had!
Great job wish we could reelect you!
Awesome! We need more clean energy. Thanks!
@nytimes it's all good but can you help the little people!
AFT, about time
I suppose you will want credit for that one too, what did you slice your ball and get lost
@atmosfan sooo much energy dawg. Lets just close all the powerplants and hope the wind goes 24/7/365 for at least our lifetime
#DidYouKnow energy can be stored in batteries? 
#JustLookAt how good batteries are! Can't even power a phone for a full day if you watch one half a porno
#WouldYouBelieveMeIfIToldYou that you can use more than one battery.. And it can be bigger than a phone!
sold on it. By midnight tonight i don't want one more coal ever being burnt !! And nat gas p plants? #FawgetAboutIt
There are already hundreds of these Iowa alone. Nothing new whatsoever. 
Thanks @BarackObama but you need to tell @GinaRaimondo not to build that fossil fuel power plant in Burrillville RI @nytimes
@steveahlquist @nytimes  Hopefully we don't get overconfident from this praise & build fossil fuel power plant in Burrillville
Have they figured out a way not to kill hundreds of birds with the turbines?
@nytimes Awesome
@nytimes Great work!!
@nytimes Outstanding
awesome! need more of this, less of,"clean coal". Train coal miners to assemble, install and maintain renewable systems.
@nytimes good for you #RhodeIsland #salute

@nytimes what did it cost and what is the return on the investment?
@nytimes I don't believe this way Mister President ; excuses me this is not the viable future .
well done when will America start to print its own money like the founding fathers tried so many years ago. No progress
I remember when the Kennedy's blocked offshore wind farms.
They look even better from the beach
OMG... Someone did something because it made sense and it's for the good of the people AND the planet? I'm stunned.
Thank you for the shout out to Block Island and support for clean energy, Mr. President!

@nytimes you are one of the best. Can't wait to see your face craved on the mountain.
@nytimes 好
thank you Mr. President.
@nytimes put solar-powered heaters in automobiles and save billions on heat in the winter
'Fighting wind farm'... Haha..
whoa. That's great!!
@nytimes سيدي الرئيس عند وجود تغير في الطقس علينا مبادرة لزرع كميات كثيرا من الأشجار لأنها كما تعلمون تمتص الغاز وتضخ الأكسجين
You guys have a lot of time to make up, though I don't doubt America's capacity to build incredible feats of engineering
@nytimes the future is upon us!
@nytimes 

GE Alstom Haliade 150 offshore generator used for this wind farm were produced and loaded in Saint-Nazaire France !
hi men
@ToniMRoth oo!
Who Paid for it  got any more of that ransom money stashed?????
@theCLF proud to be part of this first for America.   Spin baby spin.
@nytimes Nigeria: abundance of d naturals 4dclean energy. It's also about d pple &the ldership. A new beginning CO-COMPATRIOTS
How many sea birds will it kill?
Congrats ! create clean energy , because American's First @nytimes
@APPropst If this project is a success, how will this affect the standing of current energy companies?
.@BarackObama Exactly what we need. Who's on for bringing the same to #phl? @350philly @PhilaPSR
damn right, and @INSPIREenviron was instrumental in that success. big-ups! #climatechange #RenewableEnergy #dowork
@TheHaveles is this the first time a sitting president has acknowledged rhode island
I think Kennedy vacationed here once while in office....
the Clintons visit/ed here all the time. They have friends in RI.
@nytimes wonderful! #cleanenergy
@nytimes Great work President Obama you doing well for America
I was just up there and got to see some this being built. It was cool to watch!
@nytimes Thanks Obama #ThanksObama

@nytimes tell that to the dead birds
Mr. President, can we send you a subscription to The Block Island Times e-edition? All the news about the wind farm there, too.
Little Rhody! First colony to declare independence, last to ratify Constitution. 'Though she be but little, she is fierce.'
That's pure good @BarackObama
@nytimes Climate change is not real. ISIS is real!!
actually it will do more damage than good They r costly 2 make and maintain, huge eye sores and kill birds. Feel good liberals.
Your wind farms also kill significant numbers of birds. But let's not include ALL the facts. Typical democrat.
pls award medal of freedom to 15 brave women=fought 4 racial equality & human rights in '63 & jailed 4 going 2 a movie. Thnx
@nytimes by cooling off the planet....because they're fans....LOL
@nytimes smallest state in the US doing big things. Love my home state
And a better and cleaner ocean invironment around the windmill 
@nytimes well done

Great job Mr. President, we're going to really miss you !! Thanks for keeping us safe. You are and will always be the best
Good. Now we need to get a way to take the Texas sized plastic piles out of our Oceans. They have been finding dead whales.
development very helpful
@nytimes We need your work to continue President Obama, in all aspects.
Climate change has been a natural earth process for billions of years without the help of humans or CO2. #StopScammingAmerica
EPA shills of the administration scammed America with their CO2 endangerment findings. We are CO2 starved #StopScammingAmerica
I live in RI!!!
Your catastrophic warming doesn't even register on a real climate change graph. #StopScammingAmerica
days r going hot
Check with our friends in Europe on how much suck unreliable forms of energy are costing the consumer. #StopScammingAmerica
You must not be aware that CO2 is the life blood of this planet, nothing more, nothing less. #StopScammingAmerica
