Welcome to VietNam, Mr.President <3
@YouTube as long as my taxes don't go up
and or work less and lose their jobs not sure which way?
hello obama your amazeing and have a happy summer :D
Where are your steps to find good jobs for Americans?
@YouTube until u leave
@YouTube , the employers heard you and are already freaking because out they can't treat people like indentured servants.
my first words on Twitter is to the president
after the hat they make you work 25 hrs more for free. Screw that switch to hourly. That salaried employee position is BS.
this notion of making ppl salaried managers is a joke. Companies just puts a hat labeled manager on that persons head.
I wud rather hv those 25 hrs and enjoy with friends and family instead of working for free. Switching to hourly is better.
I used to work for Wendy's as a salaried employee 12 years ago. The schedule was 55 hrs every week. 10 more hrs 4 shift changes
If employers switch to hourly they can't just tell employees to work for min wage. The hourly rt will be close 2 what they made
I wud rather work hourly for 40 hrs than work 65 hrs as a salaried employee. I get 25 hrs off.
the argument that salaried employees will be switched to hourly is ridiculous. Isn't it better to work hourly if you get OT?
Don't get too excited ... this actually works out to be around $285 per year and $24/month ... it's just polispeak for dummies.
did you ever think of the impact on mom and pop business?
Another edict illustrating how little the administration understands about #startups, #smallbusiness & the innovation economy.
wellcome to Vietnamese !
perfect
your administration took steps to make it harder for small business to employ people you jerk!!
How stupid. Mr. you have no clue.
no clue on what?
overtime for salary has to come from somewhere. It will come from hourly employees getting laid off.Hurting Co.
