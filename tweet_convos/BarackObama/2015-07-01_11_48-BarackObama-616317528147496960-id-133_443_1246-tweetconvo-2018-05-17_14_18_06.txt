@BarackObama isnt the name Obama care a bit selfish?
@janharder16 @BarackObama Are you being facetious or do you honestly think he's the one who coined that term?
@StrongChestwell @BarackObama he is the one who could change it...just saying
@janharder16 @BarackObama He's just rolling with it. He didn't "re-brand" the ACA and dictating hashtag trends isn't under POTUS' purview.
@StrongChestwell @BarackObama Hmm you are right. Probably is the name only for marketing, chosen by his own party.
@StrongChestwell @BarackObama 
They want that the people connect him with something positive.
@janharder16 @BarackObama That's the joke, they tried using it against him and it backfired, ACA passed and has been an overall success.
@janharder16 @BarackObama Despite like what, 58 attempts to repeal it, 59? Shit's equal parts funny and sad. No wonder Boehner cries so much
@BarackObama @chels0620_  when #obamacare lowkey helps your hermit crab live a stronger and more secure life
“@BarackObama: President Obama: #Obamacare has made health care stronger, more secure, and more reliable.”
@BarackObama Speaking of how #Obamacare influence Medical Healthcare professionals in Florida State pathway to Medical ADministrative !
@BarackObama is it preventing retail pharmacies from buying only 10 qty of one specific drug and billing 9 each to 4 different insurances?
@BarackObama anyway no use in bringing matters to your attention, you'll award those frauds with excellency awards despite knowledge of fact
@BarackObama  I really don't believe I qualify for assistance. Just wondering if anyone else has this same issue?
@BarackObama No, it has caused premium to double, deductibles to go up and coverage to go down. How is that an improvement?
@BarackObama just don't require back surgery #whenitcounts
@BarackObama We can rebuild it. We can make it better, stronger, faster...
@BarackObama You lie.
@BarackObama You lying asshole, ACA has made insurance MORE expensive and care less available and you know it!
@BarackObama it definitely has not. I'm the middle man who can't afford insurance and I don't qualify for your help. This is broken
@BarackObama no we are dying here...it may be working for the less fortunate ....BUT the middle class are still hurting....
@BarackObama  no
@BarackObama  I'm actually a supporter seeking a solution not trying to "bust your balls". Thanks
@BarackObama still unable to get ins. watching a ping pong battle. I'm told I qualify for help and rejected. Prefer to pay but told 2 wait.
@BarackObama No it hasn't
@BarackObama ah - you left out affordable - which is why you called it obamacare instead of the ACA #honest discussion
@HoltonMusicMan  RANDY BOND FOR CONGRESS #Bond2016
@BarackObama For health care, American including obamaji should follow my slogan, take more
Sound sleep, meditation
Veg food, plantation.
@BarackObama I cant afford it.   ACA $990 a month?? Come to my house and help me get affordable health care.  Prove yourself.  #ObamaCare
@BarackObama didn't dream #obamacare would be humiliating. Letter sent to doctor - unpaid premium. Pharmacy -declined. I paid ahead. Ugh.
@BarackObama Congratulation on your accomplishments, I don't think we will ever see a president who seems to be as devoted to the nation
@BarackObama BULLSHIT!
