@politico -- Mr. @JoeBiden when are you gonna #DoYourJob ?!
@politico

@politico that hand cuffed dummy could not find his ass with both hands.
@politico hey Biden, you  and your boss should do your job and insure our security, spend responsibly, reject Soro's money.
@politico Sound familiar?     http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/joe-biden-argued-for-delaying-supreme-court-picks-in-1992.html …
@politico the GOP doing a great job, POTUS is a liar
Would Dangerous Precedent be supporting illegal immigration, allowing illegals to vote and free health care as @POTUS has done?
@politico we don't need another conservative on the court.
Iran ransom payment and support of terrorist states such as Cuba and Vietnam not a "dangerous precedent" by @POTUS?
@politico time limits should be placed and financial penaltys given for poor job performance.
The pot calling the kettle again as your boss swore to uphold the constitution and has used every opportunity to circumvent it!
that is what Republican's do. And to think that we vote for these idiots.
@politico that's funny because it is called the Biden rule for a reason...
@HouseOfMichele @politico
Biden is the one who already set the precedent! Thanks Joe! They're following your lead!
@politico  it appears the Senate cannot do it's job. It's not why you were elected. DO YOUR JOB
@politico stop the killing our wildlife, our wolves Sir you have a chance to make this right
@politico Obama you are the dangerous one. You are turning the country over to radical Islam.  Election can't come fast enough
@politico it's not dangerous... Nobody is dying. They have said they will wait until you are gone. That is their right.

@politico I heard he is not a good choice
@politico hey Obama is Biden pointing at the man with the nuclear football
@politico - Republican ignorance. Very poor leadership.
@politico

thanks for the great
@politico you really are ignorant. If you did your job that would be amazing.
@politico Ehh pardon me but ..um to say but it's nothing new that's what they do they don't do anything and then they blame you
@politico This GOP Congress has actively agreed to obstruct the president at every turn for political reasons. Like children
CNN has no comment--also setting a dangerous precedent in the media with its phoney balancing act to get ratings.
@JoeBiden Is this a joke?  @JoeBiden did EXACTLY THE SAME THING!! Do you think people are idiots? There is video of it! lol
@politico السيد بايدآ فعلآ رجل عظيم كان يدافع عن السيدة  كلينتون بكل قوة مواقف مشرفة فعلآ

I think there should be some law in place to force the senate to do their jobs or not be paid.
@politico Heck Mr. Prez, Illinois politicians haven't done their jobs in years. They don't even show up but want paid for it.
@politico exactly Call them out,policymakers create jobs and have the obligations to secure fairness and safety.
@politico Uh, you mean like when, then in the Senate, spoke against a GOP Pres nominating a Justice in an election year?
