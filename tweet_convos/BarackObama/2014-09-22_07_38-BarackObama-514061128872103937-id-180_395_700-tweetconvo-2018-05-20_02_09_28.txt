@BarackObama The ranchers must have subsidized against #ClimateChange for them not to leave their fields due to maintain balance of nature..
@BarackObama The climate changes everyday.  Yesterday it was sunny. Today it might rain. Stop ruining America.
@bobreichjr no the "weather" changes every day
Climate change is long term trends changing
@AngrySheep1 You mean like how the earth has gone thru multiple ice ages since dawn of time?
@bobreichjr exactly glad you understand
@AngrySheep1 And you realize man hasn't been around since the dawn of time,  right? Glad u understand that man has nothing to do with it
@bobreichjr now the temp is rising at a rate due solely to the millions of tons of CO2 being released-ever heard of the greenhouse effect?
@AngrySheep1 yes. I read about it back in 1975 when I was in 3rd grade. Somehow the world has continued on. Ever heard of a volcano?
@bobreichjr whether you believe it or not your great grand children are gonna have a hard time shooting their guns when...
