@BarackObama @washingtonpost but they weren't black with the possibility of tilting the court left
@officialtedwinn I'm confused. It sounded like ur suggesting he shouldn't be allowed to nominate someone because he's black & has "agenda"
@BethR_27516 what/who are u talking about
@officialtedwinn "but they weren't black with the possibility..." - all honesty, it sounded like a racist white person was saying that...+
@officialtedwinn ...that's what I thought when I first read it, and I was about to call you a racist Trump fan, then I saw your profile pic.
@BethR_27516 haha!  I'm def NOT racist! Most especially because blk folks don't have power to effectuate it!
@officialtedwinn then I was going to "like" that other guy's comments saying race doesn't matter (140 character limit can lead to confusion)
@officialtedwinn Never underestimate the # of non-blacks willing to get their ass beat (on Twitter) calling out white racist KKKlovin pricks
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Keep doing your job until the last second.
