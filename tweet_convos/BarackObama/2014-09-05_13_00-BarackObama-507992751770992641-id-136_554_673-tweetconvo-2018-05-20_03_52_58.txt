@WhiteHouse @BarackObama It would be especially newsworthy if they were electric or hybrid vehicles.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama with all due respect to this great orator and leader, is it due to Obama Magic or the advent of shale gas?

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and who is buying them? Or are you giving them to Isis?
@WhiteHouse @emextremic that's cuz of tesla.
You ROCK Pres. Obama #LoveFromIndonesia @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  'Surplus to Requirement' is what got us all in this hole in the first place. Gotta think these things out, guys!
@WhiteHouse *protect people from more& more air pollution
@WhiteHouse And you brag about 'assembling' with no mention of sales because you know @TheDemocrats voters are gullible.
@whitehouse @barackobama can we do something abt companies like coke that don't pay full overtime for the salary workers but force long days
@WhiteHouse this would have happened anyway
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #JustWondering How is this an achievement?! #Environment
@WhiteHouse to bad america cant afford it.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama who is going to buy them?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Assembly =key word.  We now only fill service jobs in America. All CEO's are s c r e w i n g their employees:(
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama_Ar

@WhiteHouse guys we have to use all the oil first to get sunpower energy. Duh.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama but everyone knows it's about sales not production. How much inventory are car companies sitting on?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama is this supposed to be a good thing? Or...  vs  #koyaanisqatsi 
@Jschnabbs KOYAANISQATSI!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama so car production is increasing... Who's going to buy all these cars?
@WhiteHouse We can build all the cars we want but its all for nothing if they don't sell.
@WhiteHouse what about the parking lots full of unsold cars rusting away? I'm sure you're counting those in your figures.
@WhiteHouse More cars, but less profit. Fed overhead and taxes killing economy. Avg. car cost 38k and going up while salaries go down
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama too bad we middle class's can't afford one
@WhiteHouse @pfeiffer44 An they all are being recalled. So what that tell you UNION workers are crap, they don't build cars in USA
@WhiteHouse so they are producing? How's sales?

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama stop fucking #MiddleEast! You've let Iranian kill #Sunnis in #Iraq #Syria. Stop supporting Shiite to kill #Sunnis
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why is this a statistic to be proud of?! Especially for a government which was "committed to climate change"..
@WhiteHouse and a record 92 million Americans are not working.... So there's that...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama but they need to assemble them correctly! No more recalls!
