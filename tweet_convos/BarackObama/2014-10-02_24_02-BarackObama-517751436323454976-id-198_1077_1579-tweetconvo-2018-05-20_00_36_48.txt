@BarackObama I agree completely with that statement,  however,  I don't agree that you've done squat to correct it. Imo.
“@BarackObama: "Let's agree that no one who works full time in America should ever have to work in poverty." —President Obama”  That's me.
@BarackObama I agree. FDR's principles should still apply. Until they do, workers are screwed.

Too late fam @BarackObama
@swindellium He's been saying this for a while though, lol.
@kiaspeaks Eh...His mouth moves, but his policy record says otherwise
@swindellium very accurate. :-(
@BarackObama Reality is your job killing policies are putting more Americans INTO poverty, forcing them to be dependent on gov't. services.
@BarackObama oh yea? tell that to the rental properties and rising housing costs in Austin Texas ...

@BarackObama I don't understand... "Work in poverty"? So... A CEO working for charity in a 3rd world country in poverty shouldn't have too?

@BarackObama Lets agree that ILLEGAL ALIENS are here ILLEGALLY and should be DEPORTED.   Your own relatives, included.
@BarackObama I think we should care more that everyone has access to food, shelter, clothing, medicine & education. Poverty is of the spirit
@BarackObama I am suprised at people's attitude & reasons why people should work for nothing, we need a Mussolini to piss n their wheaties.
@BarackObama "work in poverty" is an oxymoron.  Anyone working probably will not be in poverty (excepting #HillaryClinton) #tcot #tlot #Ccot

@BarackObama Unfortunately, the .1% who control hourly pay rates, and congress, don't care about a living wage for the bottom 90%.
@BarackObama  Obama, manda um salve pra Xurupita !
@BarackObama According to @SenMikeLee, they should just try harder and be entrepreneurs.
