@repjohnlewis Great example for our youth.It's OK for our nations lawmakers to break rules and bully others to do what they want. WTF?
@repjohnlewis Bullshit, Joe. He's become a do-nothing corporatist. Tell me what this stunt achieved? Guccifer is still in OUR headlines.
You're right, and it's you and the Administration that is the challenge, to our freedom and Democracy
