@BarackObama 97% of victims of police brutality in the U.S. are either African American or Latino.
@akalayci34 @BarackObama they should stop breaking the laws and listen to officers when they are told to freeze, rather than run
@MichaeIG @BarackObama The U.S. has 5% of the world's population -- but almost 50% of the world's total military expenditure.
@akalayci34 @MichaeIG @BarackObama That has nothing to do with what he said. Don't break the law and follow orders. It's as simple as that.
@Harrison6995 @MichaeIG @BarackObama The richest 25 American's income is equal to that of almost 2 billion people.
@akalayci34 @MichaeIG @BarackObama 80% of all statistics are made up.
@Harrison6995 @MichaeIG @BarackObama %100 of Obama's speech are MAKE UP! Do you know about U.S debt?
@akalayci34 @MichaeIG Of course! I'm American Even with these issues, it's still one of the greatest countries to live in! #USA
@BarackObama The war on drugs costs $44.5billion per year, enough to provide basic healthcare for all the needy people in and outside the US
@akalayci34 @BarackObama and so much money is spent.
@dyke_geek @BarackObama In 2009, Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize even as the U.S. increased military spending by 8% that year.
@akalayci34 @BarackObama Now, hopefully he will earn his medal.
@BarackObama The U.S. Sentencing Commission: there are 150,000 innocent African Americans in prison because they had no money, friends.
@akalayci34 what makes them innocent? The fact they didn't have money? #dontpreachhate
@NichThom83 African Americans make up only 12.4% of the U.S. population but they make up close to 50% of the prison population.
@BarackObama 45 million Americans are on food stamps while the country spends $800 billion a year on maintaining its war machine.
@BarackObama 2010,Americans spent $61 billion on weight loss diets, $11 billion more than what is needed tosend  student to college for free
@BarackObama I drive 2 hybrids, I do my part.
@BarackObama climate change is real, but do people really have a significant affect on "global warming". Many studies show otherwise.
@MercianRockyRex @BarackObama http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/climate-change-acceptance/ … we both can send 50 articles back and forth. My keyword was significant cause.
@MercianRockyRex @BarackObama I am interested in your studies. I do believe humans may be speeding up the already natural fluctuation.

.@retiredaf93 @barackobama "You may like the scientific method, but you can't keep it. It hurts our brains and that's offensive."
@BarackObama In some ways, it's scary that #ActOnClimate still means trying to convince people to believe it's real.
.@barackobama Science Quiz! Which of those three *smoke stacks* is emitting CO2, the invisible, odorless, tasteless plant nutrient?
.@barackobama That is NOT what 97% of #CliSci "agree" and you'd know it if you weren't the most ignant President ever.
