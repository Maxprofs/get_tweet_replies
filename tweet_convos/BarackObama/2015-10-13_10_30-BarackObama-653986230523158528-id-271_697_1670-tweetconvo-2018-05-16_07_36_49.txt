I'm grateful for my #obamacare @BarackObama as I had a change in employment and wouldn't have healthcare w/o it!
@sky6709 no but I got a bumper sticker and bobble head
@BarackObama I only have insurance so I don't get penalized, as per your reform! Dumb reform. Not thought out well....
@DeanFior70 @BarackObama I cancelled my insurance the minute you said I needed it or else...
@DeanFior70 @BarackObama Because I am 100% Rebel when it comes to violating my rights.
@BarackObama keeping it going will cause more to not be able to afford it.

@karolynsmithMP @9975Ts @BarackObama It is a broken system beyond repair. Scrap it!
@BarackObama Nope you are wrong Obama, but repealing you would be better.
@BarackObama Dr. should get paid no more than a military or any social worker who does similar services to their fellow citizens.
.@BarackObama OMG, have you seen what those liberals are saying about Obamacare...?
@BarackObama that's what the republicans want more black & brown people dead through other causes like no healthcare!
@BarackObama no it's not. What happened to not over more dime, if you like your plan you can keep it. Its a #fine for not buying #OvomitCare
@BarackObama liar. Impeach & arrest
@BarackObama #Obamacare will have me go bankrupt #DoSomething
@BarackObama freedom is priceless. It's just a matter of time before the masses see through "all the free stuff" taxpayers pay for.
@BarackObama this guy is so ignorant it's scary. And arrogant for that matter.
@Levi_Burress @BarackObama how is that ignorant?

@BarackObama why should hard working Americans pay for your free loading illegals and refugees
@BarackObama No has to take it away. Its failing. I paid  this whole time. Never thought my plan would be revoked this Nov It is
@BarackObama I don't know one person who needed insurance that could afford Obama care
@BarackObama Millions lost their health insurance coverage as a RESULT of #Obamacare, which is why they were forced to enroll in it!
@BarackObama lol
@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama yes Sir you did something great apostle David E. Dirden
@BarackObama Obamacare is a LIE
@BarackObama Millions can't afford ACA + the 40% premium increase. The premiums way too high, deductibles sky high.We've been lied to again!
@BarackObama Petition to President Obama, we need your help https://www.change.org/p/give-terminally-ill-patients-access-to-life-saving-drugs/u/13796788 …?
Because of @BarackObama USA has lost its Economy.  Millions of working Americans can't use healthcare because of cost. EPIC FAIL!
@skylookup1775 @barackobama well then, I suppose the Govt will just have to take over and fix it
@platospupil @BarackObama Just like they fixed Libya, Ukraine, Yemen & Afgg....
@skylookup1775 @barackobama it was their plan for healthcare all along. Foreign policy simply incompetence
@BarackObama
@BarackObama not when we don't already have it and I have to pay a huge fee because I couldn't AFFORD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!
@BarackObama pill companies such as LILLY were his biggest campaign contributors. Had to make sure he made them lots of  $$$

@BarackObama these reforms shouldn't be back.
@BarackObama Earn money http://jobrize.com/index.php?ref=596208 …
@BarackObama Do you mean our coverage would cost way less if ObamaCare is repealed. Great, Repeal this communist monstrosity.
@BarackObama

This year I have to pay a penalty for NOT buying health insurance that I cannot afford as a self employed individual. #WRONG
@BarackObama  I would like to know when does the Affordable Health Care  start working for the working class people of America?
@BarackObama Bless and make holy O Lord God all American television and picture and film shows for Your own Name's sake
@BarackObama screw obamacare get rid of it ASAP biggest lie ever told
@BarackObama No, I'm one of millions of Americans that don't have no insurance, I don't want Obamacare because you don't care at all!
@BarackObama get money from somewhere else not us
@BarackObama I CAN'T AFFORD THE INS NOW $208. A MTH PLUS COPAY THEN IM PUNISHED IF I DON'T HAVE IT  THOUGHT THIS WAS A FREE  COUNTRY?
@BarackObama great  mind
@BarackObama hi daddy Obama, I love you so much !much! much
@BarackObama The health care saves my wife life.
@BarackObama Everyone should be covered, like in Switzerland.
@BarackObama for some it helped for others it hurt ... It needs work to iron out kinks
@BarackObama thank you, glad for Obamacare!
@BarackObama when we going to read the bible?if you become as a minister foreign affairs than we can do it.
@BarackObama good Obama good Moppun http://youtu.be/Lchu4yQtDWs 
@BarackObama nobody can argue with that. But we need to move much further on making medicine affordable.
@BarackObama most americans can't afford insurance now. #waytogetmorewelfarerecipients
@BarackObama I still have no coverage and as a result, can pay my debts.
@BarackObama No it's not.  Private HMOs are getting richer- lack of providers, high denial rates
@BarackObama Obama Care is the best thing that can happen to Americans and the poor. Free medical tx in Europe and Canada has been for long.
@BarackObama W/O #Obamacare I wouldn't have had coverage for my physical and mental health
@BarackObama 
Not completely true about 51% Americans do not want it.
@BarackObama your so called affordable health care caused the insurance on my 7yr old twins to almost triple from $228.00 to $631.00 monthly
@BarackObama FACT: anything is a fact if you qualify it with "Could".  FACT: the moon could crash into the Earth, the sun could explode.
@BarackObama fact: I still don't have insurance cause Nebraska didn't expand Medicaid; cost is 1/6th my monthly pay. #singlepayernow
@BarackObama Amen, Mr. President. Too bad the GOP forced such compromise that the program's flawed, but it still beats the alternative.
@BarackObama  Americans can not afford Obama Care.
@BarackObama I can never thank you enough. May God bless and protect you and your family.
@BarackObama funny. Pay the same for coverage but now can't afford my Dr visits and prescriptions. So thanks for that. #Obamacare
@BarackObama awesome idea!  means millions will save their lives!
@BarackObama it would be terrible
@BarackObama how is giving away free @MedicareGov to millions foreigners from @china helping struggling American seniors @contact_teas ?
@BarackObama as opposed to the millions who lost their coverage because of your healthcare reform...
@BarackObama How does it feel to know most of what you so selfishly "fought" for will be repealed soonComplete waste of &EMBARRASSING
@BarackObama Repealing the ACA is indeed WRONG!
@BarackObama just another one of your brilliant ideas. let our allies in the middle east die while you fight global warming.
@BarackObama I doubt it
@BarackObama So the IRS don't take away my money, so I will do the same this year in my Taxes
@BarackObama It didn't work for me I paid the 1st quota but next month I didn't paid it was too expansive did for my income tax
@BarackObama 

Obamacare works. Congress doesn't. 

@cspanwj
@BarackObama I care little about politics but i do care that without Obamacare we would not have healthcare #Obamacare
@BarackObama just allow insurance companies to compete across state borders and let the market drive down prices and make it more affordable
@BarackObama It is working terrifically! Why would we repeal it? Cutting access to health care for ideology has to be the worst. Only in DC.
@BarackObama and why do you think the gop doesn't give a rat's ass about that
@BarackObama repealing Obamacare also means many who can work now have incentive TO work instead of milking the working class!
@BarackObama  Yes my wife & i are thankful for Obamacare as we would likely would not have health coverage without it
@BarackObama The "American dream" according to republicans seems to be everyone being killed by guns, then not having healthcare to cover it
@BarackObama Some are getting free coverage while MANY of us are now paying WAY more for WAY worse coverage and care!
@BarackObama Good evening my President, Please assist The Moorish Americans in America. Thank you Candid
@BarackObama Do 9/11 responders have medical coverage or did Republicans vote "No" to that?
@BarackObama Only to you!
@BarackObama why did you steal 800 million from medicare to pay for obama care??
@BarackObama Bad idea bad plan we will be fined this year for not having insurance we cannot afford
@BarackObama As veterans, we refuse to give up the quest for earned entitlements! http://newsninja2012.com/day-veteran-organizes-119-phoenix-va-protest-mccain-ignores-requests-help/ …
@BarackObama I rather keep my money and use it where needed. K thanks.
@BarackObama The worst piece of legislation EVER. Even POTUS didn't know what was in it. AHCA stinks!
@BarackObama Not true, next year is when it hits and we will have so much trouble!  When dropped by their employers plans!
Rt @BarackObama Repealing #Obamacare is still a bad idea.
@BarackObama  How many lost their original plans because of Obamacare ?
@BarackObama @universe2519 upgrade with @BernieSanders
@BarackObama obamacare needs to be repealed. You forced it down our throats like a tyrant. I liked my plan before but couldn't keep it.
@BarackObama  ObamaCare must be reformed with market reforms to lower health costs for all of us&help economy;shrink deficit
@BarackObama We'll just have to vote the rascals out.
@BarackObama the problem is Bobo on the Stern show. We have to ban him: http://wh.gov/iPmHt 
@BarackObama tell that to the millions of people who lost their healthcare thanks to you and can't afford nobamacare

@BarackObama Could? Or would loose coverage.
@BarackObama  I agree. Health Insurance was costing me $1450/ mo in GA due to pre-existing conditions. I'll do anything to fight repeal.
@BarackObama Think about Syria for a sec i just wonder why do you just bomb away everything in Syria name i Axel Sjögren i live in Sweden
@BarackObama why  will someone  in his right  mind  try to take away benefits  that are helping millions  of poor Americans
@BarackObama but would allow people to have an affordable plan again.   No "criteria"  BS and penalties
@BarackObama @jjbenz19 Wasted millions in repetitive bills well over 50 in GOP Congress to repeal,eat away bits=well how@1 payor for all !

@BarackObama huh when prices are up more than 50%. Your crooked website @HealthCareGov is still hackable. Meds are up 75%. Stop lying #fact
@BarackObama why don't you make health care free for all ? Then nobody will miss out! Imagine being the President that made that happen !.
@BarackObama keep Obamacare! If you don't need it...then don't get it!
@BarackObama At the rate the premiums are rising we'll all lose coverage.  Won't be able to afford it!!!
@BarackObama millions lost the coverage they wanted bc of Obamacare
@BarackObama People would u be willing to pay a little more to help someone?
@BarackObama If it's a bad idea, Republicans are for it. Anyone who needs health care should just buy a gun. & please, cut taxes for big oil
@BarackObama I would like to see data where millions lost health insurance and why.
@BarackObama Mr. President, with all due respect, passing legislation based on falsehoods and misinformation is a bad idea as well.

@MohammadRafiPa3 @BarackObama I'm very confident because that low life worm is the reason I don't have insurance right now. He lies.

@BarackObama hahahahaha
@BarackObama I say those who want it let them apply for it, those that don't want it doesn't have to apply.
@BarackObama U are the best man
@BarackObama Yes ObamaCare robbed me this year saying I had insurance with them and never did.
@BarackObama using the word "could" in a statement of "fact"? Not a true oxymoron, but could be just a moron.
.@BarackObama FACT: #Obamacare caused millions to lose coverage and forced people to buy insurance.
@BarackObama the problem is my pocket can't afford millions owing money at the end of the year for millions! Can't afford. President Obama.
@theame2 @BarackObama I voted for the Healthcare Reform I was told would be more like Canada, but turned out to pretty much be same prices
@BarackObama
~Repealing @BarackObama is preferable, w/all the baggage brought with you.
You'll become a #HumanStain ERASED from #OurHistory.
@BarackObama Didn't think that still possible.2 whom do we address concerns? I'm  disabled and medicaid is my only source for health care.
@BarackObama I'm 65 and it's hard WITH reforms. This year's plan just sent letter saying won't be offered next year :( #HealthCareReform
@BarackObama We can't let that happen. We have to get out the vote in every election and not just for the presidential years.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama actually it is. My premiums have gone up 300 since since 2013. "Save each family 1500.per year". Thanks sparky.
@BarackObama You need to reform the insurance companies to lower the premiums and the deductibles! My insurance is useless to me!
