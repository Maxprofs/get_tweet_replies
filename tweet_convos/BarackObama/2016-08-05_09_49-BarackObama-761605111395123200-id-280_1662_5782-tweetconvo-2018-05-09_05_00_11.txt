No you just changed the way unemployment is measured. Add in the Americans who never went back to work like previous stats did.
This chart is not the truth but a farce!!
Go ahead Trump and Republicans try to say Obama is a bad PresidentBetter job any Republican has ever doneVote all Blue 
"First Rule of Holes: If you're in one, stop digging".
#TPP puts more in hole.
Lost for a generation.
Haha no body actually believes that!Just the perfect gif 2 show how manipulation and fake stats rained in since you took office
goood wow very nice https://goo.gl/MlPgN2 
Your kind of followers. Those to lazy to work, islamists, crooks, political hacks & terrorist (of which you are aquatinted).
has cut the #American #unemployment in half over his 7½ years. This isn't radical. It's Progressive. This is what wants in 2017
this doesn't reflect those who have quit trying to work and are just living on welfare that you grew larger than ever.
Can we see a chart on the national debt please???
The deficit was created during the Bush years and it was caused by the tax cuts and Iraq. Both Obama opposed.#USA
Its a fake recovery, just like in the UK, time will tell.
You were tweeting about the deficit not the recovery. The recovery was real. It gave half the unemployed jobs. Jobs= economy
Bullsh$t. Millions have stopped looking for work! When the drop off unemployment rolls YOU do not refer to them as "unemployed"
fucking lie
Half of us have dropped out of the workforce because no one will hire us... Ageism is rampant! And taxes took half my severance
These numbers are skewed and don't take into account people who have up and also include H1-B jobs taken from Americans
then how come when people .in their forty' s are told they can't be hired .because they over quaifed
the people still aren't working there just not collecting  because their benefits ran out
unemployment rate hasn't been cut what has been cut is the number of people that unemployment is paying out to
I'm from Ecuador, but I wish President Obama you get to be president again in that beautiful country because you're excellent.
Please step down now we have work that needs to be done for the American people.
It is obvious you think most Americans are ignorant. I'd have to agree that 52% are (those Democrats voting for you).
Big achievement. Congrats
you ignore unemployed whose benefits ran out & stopped looking for job. Stop twisting #. Americans suffering.
@BarackObama
this is so awesome
You shut down the coal fired power plants and what will you do import power from China.
Amazing work!! From Perú
anyone can look up the fact that there are 100 working age ameicans who are underemployed, obama is a liar!
Not enough proof for me.
Mr president, Beja of Tunisia calls you to urge American investors to invest in my hometown. Beja does need your nice help...
Yes and workforce participation 
And middle class wages way to go barry
#nothingToBeProudOf
good luck
No, you cut the number of people who are still bothering to look for work at all. The numbers are bogus.
lies all lies
Why don't you talk about the weakest GDP since WW2? Hmmm
you have done a great job!  I am grateful.
The reason behind this  would be that the invasion of illegals, refugees, legal, they are replacing Americans with policy rule
the only thing you cut is the way the gov. counts the unemployed. 93 million people that is out of the workforce
Thanks
Poor poor Obama is worried Trump will undo all thge things he has done to destroy our Country. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTpNdwxf1ag …
please don't go
Your numbers don't count all the people ON MY BLOCK! LOOK AT THE REAL WORLD. 10'S OF THOUSANDS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR WORK!
Awesome!  Praise God!! Thx Prez Obama! But, I agree more work to do. African-Americans still have very high unemployment
good Obama, but think about the rest of the world, the refugees, and the unemployed youth in ur ancestral home
well done.
President you have done more  than enough that's what I see!
@BarackObama
hats off man
Yay Mr President!  A good bday present for you. You gave me best bday gift ever May 1 2011 when Bin Laden killed, will miss you
Trump will finish it we dont trust you like Hillary NO TRUST
lol
ha
Fine. Is a person "employed" when working one hour per week?  

#fixthestats
Blathering phony...go do your legacy--golf, vacation, and spend our money. You don't know what work is Mr Silver Spoon Impostor
Thank you Mr. Pres. More repub talking point falsities to crush.
Your monthly reminder that virtually all the employment growth in the recovery has been full-time. 
what about the underemployment rate and doubling the debt in 8 years?
just because the government quit counting all the unemployed  doesn't  mean it doesn't T exist
Where do you think it's going to go when Hillary raises the minimum wage to $15? I predict 30%.
So for over half your presidency, it was higher than when you took office?
because you don't count the people that have given up looking. Your charts are like you...a JOKE!
Jobs that put families below the poverty line. Apple makes phones for pennies in China then screws consumers elsewhere!
# fake numbers # millions not working #no jobs for the educated
From a recession obviously  debt had to grow with the bailouts to revive industry& saves jobs or let the the economy collapse
Other European markets that are trading partners were or still are struggling with the recession again obviously affects USA!
Thank You President Obama for all you have done over the years! You have a wonderful family.
Somebody else will get the credit#whatdidyoudo.
30 year programs? http://ritm137.blogspot.com/2015/02/obamas-way-is-30-year-program.html … #MilC2
I didn't always see eye to eye with your decisions, but I think you've been a good president. Thank you and good luck.
.   The Donald should retweet this.
God Job Mr. President...You have served us well!!!
nothing you do is good for America. Your economic numbers are always lies. Just like the ransom for prisoners lie
what is the labor participation rate and jobless rate now vs 8 years ago? We're not fools you know.
垃圾
and yet you're still known as the food stamp president
only because the number of people looking for a job declined. You really have NO context with your infographs. #Designed2Blind
"I have miles to go before I sleep". But Sir, U r passing the baton in November. Hope your successor continue your good work.
Congratulations for reducing Unemployment rate in America to half from 10% to 4.9% in last 8 years during your Presidency.
read all the facts in this article and it will surprise you how bad things really are. http://freedompartners.org/latest-news/putting-u-s-unemployment-numbers-context-july-2016/ …
says not hostage payment but Pastor Saeed Abidini said captors will not release him until other plane arrives. @SpeakerRyan
thanks my brother
can you contrast this to a chart of people leaving the workforce? It's the lowest since the 70's. People are just not working.
@BarackObama
successfully without you man..
looks like a first graders chart. All made up
action speaks louder then words. Great job! I have confident that @HillaryClinton will continue the legacy.
Well done.
@BarackObama
LIKE GIVING  A 1/2 BILLION IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TO A STATE SUPPORTED TERRORIST GOVERNMENT.  YOUR WORDS !
demoncrats are proven liars for 8 yrs now will never believe another word
wow
, You have done an awesome job despite all of opposition you've come up against. America is for ALL people, not some people!!
most people are out of work and not even in that unemployment rate. Stop lying
Seriously cooking the books there are we? http://cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/94333000-not-labor-force-labor-force-participation-628 …
@BarackObama
Look during what years relative black unemployment fell, look where they began to rise
Coward abd fethullah gülen cia agent
how about raise the salary and lower Congress's
That's not immigrants are employed
He takes the credit for all the good and none of the bad.  It's an economy and it goes up and down regardless of president.
Good work, Mr.President.
great sir
@BarackObama
no you're only counting the ones you track.. liar
smoke an mirrors
GOD NO! PLEAAASE don't do anymore WORK/DESTRUCTION to our Nation. Trump will be there with the MOP SOON to fix your mess. ;)
that's a bold faced fucking lie and you know it. Lowest participation rate in 70 years.
ok the unemployment graph is misleading. Yes potus kicked butt. The graph makes it intentionally look more damatic. Kinda bogus
You got chart upside down again... time for glasses.
Obama, after your term, can you come to Chile and be President here. Next elections are going to be awful :C
1.2% GDP you took on more debt than any two combined Presidents ever and accomplished ZERO except financing ISIS. Iran failure.
Yes, there is much more work to be done...especially around racial disparities.
So number of people on food stamps (doubled during your Presidency) will go down now?
I CAN ONLY LAUGH AND YOUR LIES AND DECEITFULNESS RIGGED NUMBERS TO MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD AND TO PROP UP CROOKED LYING HILLARY
-now you're not showing how you started changing how you CALCULATED those numbers when you took office #FudgingTheNumbers

choke on that graph @realDonaldTrump !  USA looks great to me already!!
that is because you cut the extension.  I have to work 60 hours a week just to make my bills at 43 yrs old.
@BarackObama
sooo basically you brought the percentage of unemployment to what it originally was.
You do not give anyone a fair chance. The public, who you don't give enough credit, you are a huge liar too.
@BarackObama
I still can't collect my social security disability insurance science July 2015 can we take a guest why?I served with you 88&89
summer jobs added. Lets see what September brings.
You seem less enthusiastic about the labor force participation rate. #Economics is hard for #Liberals
Barry, the whole world can see, you poor thing got your handlers boot on your neck, tells us about this evil group. CONFESS.
thank you for your help and support
more than no more
now the question is, how can we sustain this?
I'd like to know where all these jobs are. Have 2 degrees and can't buy a job. I,along with many others, think you are a liar.
the real work will start when you leave. vote trump
I hope he continues as prensident
GREAT JOB MR. PRESIDENT ... THANK YOU!

McDonalds & Walmart aren't good jobs. You haven't stopped the mass exodus of manufacturing.
wrong you change from 90 week 26th week you don't count the ones that ran out of unemployment or have to re file for extension
July 255 thousand jobs gained 166000 lost do the closures and layoffs doesn't look as promising as someone says

#Good job Mr. President. We know that there's a lot more to do but a very good job anyway

Hillary in prison for email and politic!
horseshit, how about you count everyone in your figures
Huge disappointment, especially to black people!
#Ronaldgod
labor force participation is 63% not good.  And that number includes part time workers.  The real number is more like 9.8%
OBAMA = ENEMY WITHIN!
Mr. Obama you will go down in history as the Best Presidents this country has ever seen!
true lie
