@aaarocket37 @ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS How many mass shooting did Germany have?? Where about at one a day!
Dear: @ElizabethBanks: If a conservative #POTUS uses #ExecutiveOrder to limit access to #abortion will u praise them for using #CommonSense
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS This will do nothing to save lives.  #GunGrabbers
@Rios5280 @ElizabethBanks @POTUS It sure fuc*in won't
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS you're one of my favorites, but no common sense here and unconstitutional. 2nd amendment is to prevent tyranny.
@ditty1 @ElizabethBanks @POTUS What if your the tyrant?
@Staned_Up @ElizabethBanks @POTUS is that meant to be deep?
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS The Obama Administration, the Common Sense Administration.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS thanks baby girl
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS What was the common sense?  Find me a criminal who follows the law.
@FayeHamilton1 @POTUS I could list about 50 people that don't fallow the law and thanks to there white skin they are not criminals!
@Staned_Up @POTUS List them.  Seriously.  List them. Cute claim but you have zero facts to back it up.
@FayeHamilton1 @POTUS Cute request but I don't have enough space on TWITTER! Also why no sources. IT'S TWITTER!
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS aaaannndddd blocked
@ElizabethBanks .."Hollywood stars follow Obama’s gun control script, tweeting White House talking points on cue"
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS nothing proposed isn't already in place or has been in the past. Another Clinton ban repeat, bad results
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS @g1 http://inxizel.com/tai-game/  game hay quá
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS I'm sure all the criminals are going to turn in their illegal guns thanks to Obama. #thinkifthechildren
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS I too thought it was a great idea! Then I debunked it...
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Yes, # gun laws helped those in #SanBernadino (strict gun laws) & #Aurora (Gun free zone in theater). More laws! Yay!
@ElizabethBanks Sorry but EO would not have stopped any of the mass shootings....no real reform here.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS background checks don't stop gun violence. Advanced screening may slow it down... but that is a maybe.
.@ElizabethBanks  @POTUS Common sense dictates @BarackObama #FreeOscarLopez.
.@lifenbits @ElizabethBanks @POTUS @BarackObama sigue la cantaleta?Cuando van a pedir a @NicolasMaduro x @leopoldolopez -preso politico real
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS boo just stick to acting ya pinko commie.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Explain to me again how anything Obama did is going to prevent murders. Is Chicago going to reach 550 murders in 2016
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Another progressive airhead from Hollyweird.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama Where's the sense creating more gun laws when they "don't have time" to enforce the ones already on the books?
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS What he plans will never stop gun violence... Its empty rhetoric, and has no teeth.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS : No difference...attitudes have to change not more laws..'Guns are not necessary.Dangerous'
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Do you cup Obamas balls while you choke on his shaft? Keep sipping on that liberal koolaid!
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS  Just FYI, background checks are required by online dealers, same ones he says work for refugees.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS common sense? You 1% don't have any! why don't you come and live with the rest of us down here and see what it's like
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS  don't be so stupid. His changes pissing on the Constitution wouldn't have prevented a single mass shooting. #asinine
@ElizabethBanks I'm sorry for all these dumb ass responses you're getting from these retards. I can't believe some people  are this stupid
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS So how does this keep guns out of criminals hands again?
@ElizabethBanks I didn't see Obama shed a tear over the beheading of James Foley, American deaths in Benghazi, the deaths in San Bernardino
@ElizabethBanks If u feel so strongly ab
t guns, don't appear in movies that have guns them or talk abt guns. Another anti Constitution Lib
@ElizabethBanks Criminals don't do paperwork or background checks. He has no rights to override the congress or the 2nd amendment.
@ElizabethBanks  I cant believe I pay to watch ur movies, no more. Obama just made it harder 4 women like me to be able to arm themselves.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Common sense my Ass!
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS  Thank you for being the nutcase Hollywoody you are......who are you?
@ElizabethBanks wow...
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Violating separation of powers is common sense? Maybe to a dumb actress like you, Banks.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS You DO understand that none of what POTUS just did would've stopped any of those massacres?
#2ndAmendment
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Thank you for giving me a great excuse to save money by never watching another one of your crappy movies.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS  well its funny congress voted it down 3 times buy both parties.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS yep.  Criminals didn't follow the old ways, but I'm sure they'll be steadfast to follow these new ones huh?
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS guns are inanimate objects- they have no free will. It takes a human. Where are the human reform laws?
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS WHen it comes to liberals then there is no common sense. I never will surrender my rights. NEVER!!!!!
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS @BarackObama this will do nothing to stop gun violence
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS No guns for American's to protect ourselves while your POTUS lets terrorists in to kill us. Go away!
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Hey dummy! Your POTUS sold guns illegally to Mexican drug cartels. He is giving guns to Syrian terrorists.
@ElizabethBanks you closet commie liberals wouldn't know common sense if it ran you over twice. Won't #StopGunViolence @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks this will stop nothing,background checks have nothing to do with criminals
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS and you say this with armed guards protecting you? Another POS celeb
@ElizabethBanks  #STOPGUNVIOLENCEINMOVIES
@ElizabethBanks, what are your thoughts about this old congressional testimony from a female gun violence victim?
@ElizabethBanks Made 4 movies about an oppressive authoritarian government slaughtering it's people but still doesn't understand 2A
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS common sense is not ignoring or circumventing the constitution especially misinterpreting it as well!!
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS arguments make as much sense as the bs @POTUS spews out of that sewer.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS kitchen knives and what about vehicle homicides or the people that hang or drown themselves your
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS as you know both were recent incidents and both done with a knife. Do we have to have a license to buy
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS your a poor excuse for common sense! What bout the McDonalds mngr & the guy that held wife & kids hostage
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS 5^
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS He has no common sense, no do you if you think circumventing the constitution is the right thing to do
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Hey Dingbat, explain how this is common sense when none of these measures will work. It's all political theater.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS there is no common sense whatsoever in his gun agenda

@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS Cars kill waaay more kids every day. Why not go for the cars?
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS common sense what a joke. The mans presidency has been based on deceit
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS common sense my ass

@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS thank you POTUS for being so soft. U r a coward. The country needs a strong POTUS.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Sign a pledge you will no longer appear in any performance that uses a gun. Put your money where your mouth is!!
@5OKid @ElizabethBanks @POTUS great point ! The Dems give a pass to these Hollywood wankers all the time
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS stick to acting..you dont know what youre talking about. this illegal action will do nothing to stop guns.
@ElizabethBanks Hey its not the guns that's the http://problem.NRA 
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Try stopping the gratuitous violence in film and tv.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS he wouldn't know common sense if it bit him on the ass.
@ElizabethBanks Estoy absolutamente de acuerdo @WhiteHouse @POTUS "Recibe muchas cartas de padres, maestros y niños, para pedírselo también"
Too bad @ElizabethBanks has no common sense! #StopGunViolence  @BarackObama @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks On the Titanic that is the US Economic, Domestic, and Foreign Policy gun issues are Deck Chairs.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Common sense? Where? I see he has you fooled too. Leave honest folks alone and go after criminals.
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS Not a proper executive action situation, whether his legal team could finagle logic for it or not.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS people kill people not guns!
RT @professorx10 RT @ElizabethBanks Thank you @POTUS for a dash of common sense on guns. #StopGunViolence #news #p2 #TFB Obama
@Tigerfists88 @professorx10 @ElizabethBanks empty rhetoric to make you feel better, changes nothing.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS Thank you! How anyone can have a problem with gun control is beyond me, unless they're dumb and blind!
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS None of these measures would have stopped any of the mass killings.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS is it common sense to take away rights of the innocent?
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS  @MomsDemand time will show yall, this won't stop crime. Disarming Americans creates more gun violence.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS AS A VETERAN WHO SERVED MY COUNTRY IN TIME OF WAR STOP THe GUN Violence. WANT a WEAPON join the military
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS guns don't kill, people kill.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS our definitions of common sense are very differnt
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS They blatantly feed you lies and you thank them????
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Even though it wouldnt have made any difference in any of the incidents you mentioned in that speech
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS What about the constitution?
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse how did we get here? Look in the mirror @POTUS  God will expose you
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS @WhiteHouse 
 THANK YOU POTUS, YOU ARE THE MAIN NRA MEMBER  RECRUITING TOOL!
JUST RENEWED FOR A LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP!
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS @WhiteHouse 
Read the 100s of gun laws on the books before engaging in any intelligent conversation!
@ElizabethBanks @WhiteHouse @POTUS unfortunately the majority of your country just don't get it!
.@ElizabethBanks @POTUS @WhiteHouse Speaking of dash - excuse me as I dash off to get my CCW license and a couple guns. Motiviation!
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS restricting the people's right to defend themselves is surely a great thing. Dumbass liberal
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS y ou are right
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS the tears were a fitting touch to another bull shit speech. Buy American, support Smith & Wesson
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama @POTUS IDIOT OBAMA..the ppl w legal guns r nt th problem.. th criminals dont hv permits n don't buy legal guns
@ElizabethBanks i'd urge you to look at each of those orders and the laws they will affect. they don't stop violence and hurt citizens
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Absolutely.  
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS What common sense? Citizen disarmament is not sensible.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS it has to be done my tears flow for every American
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS no common sense what so ever  if criminals and  gangbangers  still have  guns !
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS 
Wow, u you have a lot of dumb AMMOSEXUALS following you.  The dead kids. Probably their fave part of hunger games.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS GUNS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS and yet you are employed by Hollywood who makes gun violence in movies look like a fun thing to do--shame on you!
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS it won't safe a single life or stop a single shooting before you commend him you need to know the subject

@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Thank you Elizabeth for supporting common sense measures. Much love from @MomsDemand!
@Rebecca_221B @ElizabethBanks @POTUS @MomsDemand An anti gun nuts version of kissing the baby. He's a hostage of the anti gun lobby.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS If only criminals and terrorists had common sense and obeyed the laws.Other then that,this should make people safe.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Thank you for ensuring Veterans will not seek mental health treatment of any kind so they dont get on an FBI list.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS Hi Liz.Follow me?
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS you do realize there were already checks, even at gun shows and online.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS disagree but that's okay. #stopthebs #stoptakingourrights
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS So disappointed to c these RTs from someone I admire to be bamboozled by BOs grandstanding.
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS the court will shoot it down just like Immigration
@ElizabethBanks @POTUS 6200 guns seized in Chicago in FY 2015 62 federal gun prosecutions.....let that sink in a minute. Have a nice day.
@JDtheDJ2004 @ElizabethBanks @POTUS how many of those guns were legal purchases
