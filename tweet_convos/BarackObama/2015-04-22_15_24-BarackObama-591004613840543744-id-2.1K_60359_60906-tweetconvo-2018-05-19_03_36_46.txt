.@BarackObama @jnelson651 @aden_casey what do you think POTUS would get in 2 minute drill?
@QGorski @aden_casey no doubt he could be in the 1:30s, but consistency is key. I worry about endurance and the repeatability of his form.
@jnelson651 @QGorski probs like the low 90s on 15 minute 3s
@aden_casey @QGorski POTUS vs Mose in 1on1. Up to 11 by ones and twos. Make it take it. 4 dribble limit. Call own fouls. Who ya got?
@jnelson651 @aden_casey is Mose wearing basketball shoes or running shoes?
@QGorski @jnelson651 how tight are Mose's socks on his calf?
@aden_casey @QGorski grey adidas running shoes and these bad boys....
@jnelson651 @aden_casey @QGorski kev would rock these. Right kev? @KPangos #Kev
yet he's stepping on the line, typical Obama cutting corners. What is truly real is his Vacation time 3 days a week to go golf
@dongohuber Did...  did you just cartoon PPB the President?
