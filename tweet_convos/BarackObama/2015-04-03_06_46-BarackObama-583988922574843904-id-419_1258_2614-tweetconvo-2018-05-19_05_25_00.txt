@BarackObama Why has Texas created more jobs than all the other states... combined?
@UriBlago @BarackObama The questionable part is: How can there be job creation in Texas while the whole world is in decline? Not even a dip
@Butthurt9to5 Since 2010, Texas has put more people back to work than every other advanced economy...combined.
@UriBlago Respectable. But I wonder what its magic juju is. Oil? It didn't loose many jobs either.
@Butthurt9to5 Republican leadership. On the flip side, look at Detroit.
@UriBlago True words. I can't hate on it. If the numbers add up; its beautiful. I also think pride.
