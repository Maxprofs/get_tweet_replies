@BarackObama   POWER …leads to...GREED……leads to.... CORRUPTION……leads to..… CHAOS…leads to.... UNSTABLE SOCIETY…leads to..…FALL. !
@BarackObama Oh sorry, until this statement I was a great fan. The U.S. interferes too much with the rest of the world already.
@BarackObama don't you mean big banks, corporations, and billionaire politician buyers?
@BarackObama so......what rules are they!?! Again....This man says nothing.  He just puts out broad quotes of meaningless propaganda.
@BarackObama 野心岂止于大，biger than biger
