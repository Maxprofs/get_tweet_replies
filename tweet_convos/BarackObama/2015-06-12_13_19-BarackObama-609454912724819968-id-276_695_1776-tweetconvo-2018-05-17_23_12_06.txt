@BarackObama The climate change that doesn't exist
@BarackObama DEAR Sir BARACK WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN HAWAII WHERE YOUN WERE BORN & WE WANT TO BE THERE IN 2015 & 2016 O"K??? AZIMBEK SUPPORTER
@BarackObama fighting against climate change is my opinion. Climate change often means me. supporting in opposition. Great!
@BarackObama Just now I said to Putin etc.: I'll help solve difficult civil problems if they have when I get other countries even e.g. AU.
@BarackObama if I get to US or AU, Russia still asks me difficult civil problems. This is very good things for US and whole world.
@BarackObama Not thinking so would be wrong.
Chinese hackers accessed classified military and intel data, and @BarackObama is tweeting about climate change. http://news.yahoo.com/union-says-federal-workers-fell-victim-hackers-071851098--politics.html …
@hale_razor @harryseeword @BarackObama I doubt that the Republic will survive Barry's progressive assaults on it.
@DeatonCAPT @hale_razor @harryseeword We will, and it will demonstrate how the most valiant attempts by internal enemies could not topple us
@AmberGirl3 @hale_razor @harryseeword I'm praying you are correct.

@BarackObama 하기 힘드네요. 매번 이런씩으로 알려주는데 제가 눈치체고 알려도 아무도 막지 못하네요. 왜 정확하게 알려주지도 않으면서 꼭 사건을 터트리는지 아리송 하지만 더 이상 이런 의도적인 사건 예언에 신경 안쓰기로 했어요.평범하게 살래요
@BarackObama 아 그리고 한국 메르스 유행 몇달전부터 55번 숫자로 알려줬어요. 자연 발생적인게 결코 아녀요. 55번 숫자가 호흡과 관련된 숫자예요. 메르스가 호흡기질환이니 결코 우연이 아니줘 왜 이렇게 미리 알려주고 사건들이 터지는지 이해
@BarackObama @HawaiiNewsNow and idiots like yourself are leading the fight against peace.
@BarackObama 日本はいちばん東、ハワイは一番西と聞いた事が、ありますよ！ハワイ行ってみたいですね！オバマ大統領が親日派なのは良くわかりました。

@BarackObama 메르스 때문에 덮혔네요. 제가 불법인체실험 사이트 운영하고 탄원하는데 탄저균실험도 관심 대상이예요.
@BarackObama 일하니 살맛 나네요. 머리 맑아지는데 육체노동이 최고 인것 같아요. 담배만 끊으면 재벌인데 참 끊기 힘들어요. 어제는 담배 참으니 눈알이 욱신욱신 아파서 또 폈어요. 건강하세요. 그리고 주한미군이 한국 탄저균 실험한것 틀켰는데

@BarackObama 저번에도 트럭이랑 머리 박았는데 트럭 사고 견적이 120만원 나왔는데 머리는 홍진 헬멧 써서 그런지 멀쩡했어요 월급55만원 받는데 석달정도면 카드 빛 다 갚을것 같아요. 새벽에 배달 마치면 엄마집에 들러 수박 먹는데 꿀맛이네요.
@BarackObama 오늘 신문배달하는데 오토바이 두번 넘어져 사고 났어요. 신문 많이 실고 넘어져서 무릅까지고 신문 다 돌리고 배급소 오는길에 또 넘어졌어요. 뒷바퀴를 너무 조여서 잘 미끄러 지는것 같아요. 필요이상 과도한 정비도 않좋은것 같아요.
@BarackObama 
Mr. Presidente with my respect, it is really confusing me your position against the ware on What it's called Daaesh !
