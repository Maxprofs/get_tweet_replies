@BarackObama the USA has to catch up on what's really good for working families and stop the Grd
@BarackObama good going Mr.  Obama you are absolutely right about that.
@BarackObama and who pays for this? The companies they work for? Who pays them for lost employee time?
@CollinTaylorInc @BarackObama Spoken like a true capitalist. Remember, when you take care of employees they take care of you #EverybodyWins
@DustyJep @BarackObama I already take care of my employees. They ALL make more money than me, and wrk less hours then me
@CollinTaylorInc @BarackObama We want to change the culture of employee abuse by big corps, small businesses often care for their employees.
@DustyJep @CollinTaylorInc @BarackObama Small business is exactly where the pain is greatest. Regs hurt them more.
@ruthdianecotter @CollinTaylorInc @BarackObama So we deregulate? I understand there is an issue I want a solution not an argument.
@DustyJep @CollinTaylorInc @BarackObama Doesn't have to be black or white. Try gray. Make regulations livable--win/win.
@ruthdianecotter @CollinTaylorInc @BarackObama I think we would agree on that, but gray is not that simple, there are many different grays
@BarackObama NOT NEEDED!

@BarackObama And Americans should be assured that our Social Security Benefits don't get pilfered.  What are you doing to insure this??
@BarackObama we do have it, you have to have a doctors excuse and you get paid leave, what the heck are you talking about?
@BarackObama and it should not matter state or job type
@BarackObama Small businesses should have the basic security of determining what they can afford in terms of benefits.Balanced approach.
