@BarackObama 

How many lost their previous coverage?  Doctors?

I'm paying a ton more.

#repealobamacare
I lost my primary care Dr when I lost my insurance  Now just have lung dr. No one to monitor my cancer remission @lgliddon @BarackObama
@tweet2u2 @lgliddon @BarackObama Seriously... Terrible I am so sorry. People have no clue about what Obamacare has done
I know a woman taking a $4k/mo cancer medication. She was notified #OBAMACARE isn't covering it anymore. #DeathPanels @Final_Rule
@tweet2u2 My mother passed away from #Parkinsons almost 3 years ago...#DeathPanels were her biggest fear. Should be the patients dec not gov
@Final_Rule @tweet2u2 Medicare death-paneled my dad in 2003. His wife's insurer took him back & paid for the treatment, no questions asked.
@Taxpayers1234 @tweet2u2 Who was the insurance company?
@Final_Rule I think it was Blue Cross. @tweet2u2
@BarackObama Including my daughter who started her own business Thank you Mr. President.
@BarackObama were forced to*
@BarackObama I must be the only one who lost mine because of obamacare
@BarackObama very good BO
@BarackObama
@BarackObama obamacare is an absolute joke. Not to mention its against the constitution for the government to force anyone to buy something
@BarackObama What about immigration?
@BarackObama because you cut half of those peoples care& forced them to buy your shit care. The other half, U forced by penalty of fines.
@BarackObama "AWESOME" well done shame such a lot of  Americans don't realise know how GOOD it is. Republicans are dinosaurs

@BarackObama hii88 siiirrr
@BarackObama your doing a great job.
@BarackObama middle America can't afford health care. You're too rich for one AND too poor for the other. Obamacare isn't helping me.
@BarackObama  Under Threat... Sir... But what goes around comes around.
@BarackObama Only because you threatened them with fines for not doing so.
@BarackObama AND JUST AS MANY HAVE LOST THEIR'S...TELL THE TRUTH, OBAMA, OH, RIGHT, YOU CAN'T, ITS AGAINST YOUR RELIGION. KORAN SAYS ITS OK.
@BarackObama Mr. President you have all the power to enact universal health coverage to all US citizens as in countries like Venezuela.
@BarackObama Yes, and my premiums, deductibles & copays have all gone way the fuck up.  Thanks Barack, you #AsshatInChief You're a dick.
@BarackObama in the words and spirit of your pastor Jeremiah Wright: "God damn Barack Obama!" Thanks for fucking things up, #AsshatInChief

@BarackObama In a democracy, a person should have a right to choose rather or not he wants to purchase health insurance without being taxed!
@BarackObama hey, I know you couldn't afford it before, but now, if you don't get it, I'm gonna fine you.  makes sense.  smh
@BarackObama I will also like to mention that I think you're a great president! !
@BarackObama I could not afford it then, nor can I now.  Plus my kids cannot get coverage because it costs us 3X what it was...
@BarackObama+ child insurance× month affordable??? Not to mention that I don't even qualified for any type of assistance! !!
@BarackObama - me:  a Single Parent with a mid class salary  that doesn't qualify for a  affordable Health insurance or is a $300 dlls +
@BarackObama @BarackObama  -living from welfare receiving: Free health insurance, Free Food,Free Housing, but what about people like me:
@BarackObama  Mr . Obama I will like to point out that half of that Americans are unemployed (with no desired of getting a job! !)
@BarackObama And all the Americans have gained new taxes because of it. #yay
@BarackObama at what cost?  Ours is at the cost of the fear that you'll take our taxes as a penalty, taxes we've earned and depend on.
@BarackObama In Europe,Leaders ask to diminish prosperityOf people and make them suffer of a big lossOf healthCare,of pensions,of youth care
@BarackObama I call bullish;t on that.
@BarackObama And 20 million lost there coverage
@BarackObama OR ELSE PAY THE FINES, SNICKER SNICKER.
@BarackObama And 5 million have been driven into poverty by you and @SpeakerBoehner when you didn't #renewui .  You're both despicable.
@BarackObama wish he could run for 4 more, I remember when he was campaigning, he promised CHANGE and stuck to his word. Obama rocks!
@BarackObama I'm one of those 
@BarackObama what about us that have been screwed cuz of the cost.Ive always had insurance until two years ago. now i no longer can afford
@BarackObama If you follow me i'll vote for you when i'm 18. Only two more years!.....Oh.
@BarackObama LIES LIES LIES! Wake up people! Most of the people he is talking about had coverage but were cancelled as a result of OCare.
@BarackObama I can't afford your health insurance. What do you suggest I do??????????
@BarackObama how many of those Americans signed up due to fear of being fined by the IRS? I'll never sign up and will fight any and all fine
@BarackObama Health care is very important, that`s the right way !!!
"...after I caused 16 million to lose it." MT @BarackObama "More than 16 million Americans have gained the security of health care coverage"
@BarackObama 16 million divided by 4trillion = thank god for common core and the destruction of math
@BarackObama And since you came in to office, how many people, besides my dad, have lost jobs in the health care field?
@BarackObama ANOTHER BIG FAT LIE, over half of those already had plans that were canceled due to obumacare
@BarackObama an amazing achievement. Well done Mr President
Impeach!!!!! RT @BarackObama: "More than 16 million Americans have gained the security of health care coverage." —President Obama

@BarackObama healthcare has cost me 10X since ObummerCare started.  Thanks for the heartache.
@BarackObama do you ever tire of lying?
@BarackObama Now we need to expand and enable to same coverage and protections for rural/underserved populations. #Telehealth #cybersecurity
@BarackObama We need to make sure that they also gain more robust #Cybersecurity protections for their #PII & #HIPAA #data to go with it.
