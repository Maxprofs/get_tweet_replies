@pchoward80 @BarackObama And your premium never went up before? Mine didn't go up by much. And I'm privately-insured.
@pchoward80 @BarackObama So what you're saying is that prior to ACA your out of pocket never went up. Liar.
@pchoward80 @BarackObama That's because the ACA specifies that insurance execs can only pocket 15% of your premium not the 50 they did.
@BarackObama  and 100 percent of ilegals are too
@delwood21 @BarackObama For THAT you can thank Saint Ronnie. HE was the one that ordered they not be turned away.
@BarackObama at outrageously high prices! Thanks for making me lose my coverage!
@coryjcrowley @BarackObama He didn't make you lose your coverage, your employer did.
@RiverMikeRat @BarackObama I'm self employed.  I had great BCBS coverage until he ruined it
@coryjcrowley @BarackObama I'm self-employed too. I and my employees have better coverage now than before, thanks to the ACA.
@BarackObama Congratulations Mr. President!  Eat your hearts out Republigluttons!!!
@halmick7 @BarackObama up yours, I can no longer afford insurance
@elholt1953_ed @BarackObama I couldn't even get insurance before I retired because of a preexisting condition.  Is "up yours"  necessary?
@halmick7 @BarackObama did you vote for him?
@BarackObama with all that extra money rolling in, how is the economy in such bad shape?. What's the mulah being spent on?.
@BarackObama Thank you Mr. President!

@BarackObama #GetCovered  too bad  working stiffs have rising premiums w/less coverage. Can't afford health care for the 1st time in 12 yrs.
@BarackObama , Bull Shit Mr. Obama. Millions are not covered because they can not afford Obamacare. This is your failure. This and Syria.
@MNMcClean @BarackObama WHAT IS YOUR SUGGESTION MR MIKE?
@karaaram @BarackObama Which bitter pill do you swallow? The single point payer expanded medicare/medicaid, or a socialized health system?
@MNMcClean @BarackObama ACTUALLY THE NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM WOULD BE THE BEST.
@BarackObama That means more than 30 million aren't.
@shelia58 @BarackObama True. But to go from 14.5 pct uninsured to 10 pct costs $1T+. Not great.

@BarackObama Thanks to you I qualify for the expanded Medicaid benefits. I didn't before. Someone in WV does love you #Me
@BarackObama Obamacare is a means to not only charge people for healthcare, but charge them for not affording it. In short, scam!
@BarackObama Some people get money and buy and spend quickly tell them one dollar an ounce mind needs
@BarackObama Thats awesome but you have forsaken us to the TPP. Why? Where is your integrity? R U a puppet too?
@BarackObama what a disgrace
@BarackObama well done MR president Obama
@BarackObama Mr Obama do you really read our comment??
@BarackObama Way to go Mr.President. Well done :)
@BarackObama your wrong about obamacare the only people that benefits from obama is people that on welfare not nobody else thats a fact obam
@BarackObama lost my doctor. Premium went up $2400 per year.  You did my family no favors.  Shame on you.  You lied.
@BarackObama عندك سلف خمسين فلس ؟
@BarackObama too bad a lot of us will NOT be covered after January 1 because of rates increasing 200%.  Smh who can afford that?
@BarackObama  LC no clue of the perils of public option/single payer. You think people are going bankrupt and dying now? Just wait
@BarackObama BTW, penalties for not complying with forced purchase of ACA set to increase exponentially in coming years.
@BarackObama  Right into single payer system (Original goal). BTW, premiums set to skyrocket, especially after Obama leaves office.
@BarackObama  your expanded Medicare which you include in your ACA numbers. More tax payer money. Lorrie Cellini it will be tweaked...
@BarackObama  Your ACA is crumbling under its own weight. Not enough healthy people actually paying into the system to pay for subsidies and
@BarackObama  My taxes do subsidize those who make the cut. Having health insurance doesn't mean you can afford or get health care.
@BarackObama  Now, $7000 deduct, unlimited out of pocket, $650/month premium. Previous ins didn't meet "standards". Thank you, sir.
@BarackObama more BS obama - now rates are up, exchanges crumbling, programs bankrupt, costs up - you screwed up and things NOT better!!
@BarackObama  Why not say 100% covered? Meaningless. Still > 30 mil without. Used to have $500 deduct, 20% yearly out of pocket, $10-25 dedu
@BarackObama Mr Prezident We Love you So much..You are So successful..We Adorable Love America Wish you all the Best
@BarackObama I can't afford even the market place insurance because the tax credit I get for 2016 is $300 less than what I got in 2015
@BarackObama 90% covered in what? The stuff that spews from your mouth? #obamacare is failing as bad as you are and you know it! #Shameless
