.@BarackObama Climate always changes, you dummy. We aren't causing it. The SUN is responsible.
@OhioCoastie @BarackObama JUST the sun? You're leaving a lot out, Alo. Earth's "wobble" has more to do with it.
@Phildoc2 Yeah, you're right. It's the Earth's movements & the Sun's variations.
@OhioCoastie @Phildoc2 And if all you deniers are wrong? What's the problem with moving to cleaner energy? Reducing pollution?
Why not?
.@normalnot1 We're not wrong. Look at the recorded temperature observations, not computer models.
@OhioCoastie I can look out my door and see the changes! Go on! Bury your head in the sand! Tell your grand kids ,you looked the other way
.@normalnot1 So you want to enact unconstitutional & prohibitively-expensive restrictions based on your personal observation of weather.
.@normalnot1 That's utterly insane.
@BarackObama That's a little bit grim of you, don't you think?
@Richmac33 @BarackObama that's earth in one word pretty much, grim
@Mad_Klauss @BarackObama Actually, the earth, and life in general, is pretty damn awesome. If its grim for you, I'm sorry. It's not for me!
@Richmac33 @Mad_Klauss @BarackObama it is grim. Do you think the earth is perfect and all that's going in is good for it?
@mrgregariously @Mad_Klauss @BarackObama It's not grim at all. The earth is amazing. There are things that need changing but its still great
@Richmac33 @Mad_Klauss @BarackObama but the things need I be changed ASAP.
@mrgregariously @Mad_Klauss @BarackObama What would you change ASAP?
@Richmac33 @Mad_Klauss @BarackObama the glasses comment meant to come off eralier. If I was in charge I would have china shit down
@BarackObama @stacyl61 True and the rest of the world agrees except GREEDY BASTARDS like KOCH and Co. and of course
@ABHI2747541  The climate has always changed. Neither @BarackObama nor any other human can change that.
@ABHI2747541 Hey there! So how'd you do on your tests?  And how's everything else going?
@ABHI2747541 Oh no!  I hope he makes it. I used to be a veterinarian's assistant & had to stop doing it. Too hard seeing em suffer so much.
@ABHI2747541 -And my little dog, Pixie, who was 18 recently passed away. I miss her so much. She had a long life 4 a dog.Not long enough tho
@ABHI2747541 So do you know what's wrong with him??
@BarackObama well that's ignant...climate change isn't new. Generations have felt it for, well, generations. @RominaSnow
@BarackObama q
We are the first generation to feel the effect of #climate change & the last generation who can do something about it - @BarackObama
@BarackObama One thing we definitely need to do is #banfracking. Disappointed in lack of leadership on this.
@LisaOffutt @BarackObama What kind of car do you drive, Lisa?
@thooleys @BarackObama Toyota Echo, 40mpg. But I work from home so don't drive much.
@LisaOffutt @BarackObama I drive less than 1k per year, but still see it hypocritical to criticize fracking unless I go all electric.
@thooleys @BarackObama What's hypocritical is styling oneself a climate leader and promoting fracking. Methane is much worse than CO2.
@LisaOffutt @BarackObama You do understand that the President is not a dictator. You do understand that he needs a Congress.
@thooleys @BarackObama He can show leadership without an act of congress. That's a silly statement.
@LisaOffutt @BarackObama You mean like this?

@BarackObama @MormonDems Repugs only believe hurricanes O.K.&Boston bombings &prob climate changes fault of Gays!Best let madame Pele know!
@BarackObama no matter what you believe it's hard to argue against cleaning up our environment - clean air, water and land are essential
@ErinBrockovich you might make that point to our local council here in kilkenny, Ireland- #savekilkenny

@BarackObama Had to change it to global climate change did ya. Seems the recent cold snaps didn't fit global warming.
@BarackObama All you are doing is trying to get another way to tax us. NO!
@BarackObama it's getting cold outside it must be global warming
@BarackObama First generation to feel climate change? There were people on earth at the end of the last ice age, right? Give me a break. SMH
@BarackObama You're delusional. How about giving that Nobel Peace Prize to Ray Rice. He deserves it more than you.
@BarackObama I am feeling the effects of 'climate change'. I thought I was going to freeze to death last winter.
@BarackObama an expert at climate change too now??
@BarackObama “Fascism is the stage reached after Global Warming has proved an illusion.”

@BarackObama @orangutans 51% of the worldwide pollution is by the EEUU so...please start for your own country.
@BarackObama @JesperTornbjerg Too late probably, and ask yourself why USA still will not commit to the Kyoto Protocol ?#Climate2014
@BarackObama Not to forget that population  explosion esp in Africa and other developing nations is a contributory factor.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @IMsoLexi  but r u doing anything about it? Or jus making war about it ?
@cloud9bound_ of course. The simplest thing anyone can do is calculate it carbon footprint & decrease it as much as u can.
@BarackObama  there's always a first and last.. "last generation to do something about it" u know we all gone die. just say it.

@BarackObama hello!
@BarackObama we can do something now to reduce the effects of the climatic change on our children, small children... brief for the future
Great quote @BarackObama: We are the first generation to feel effect of climate change + the last generation who can do something about it.
@BarackObama We have a lot bigger things to worry about right now than the climate.
@BarackObama if we don't do something now later it will be late
@BarackObama And just what is your climate change? the ice caps melted but now are larger than ever. temps higher than ever? where? etc

Indeed,if we dont take care of the environment now it wont bother us in future @barackobama @e_volution

@BarackObama @WFP then do something about it. Stop chemtrails, and make it legal for us to live off grid and not feed the oil companies.

@BarackObama @alexgreycosm and thats why you keep pushing WAR? , Fuck  you!
@BarackObama sir, you are absolutely correct.
@BarackObama the last because the cycle  be over soon and the new ice age will be coming again
@BarackObama Even the scientists who are pro-AGW say 1% change in 100 years and that is trivial. No need to leap to conclusions.
.@BarackObama-We are first generation to feel the effect of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it #reiders

@BarackObama so you mean you obey the Kyoto protocol???
@BarackObama @Crossie94  bullshit climate change is mother natures natural   Cycle.
@itsmeJohnStokes @BarackObama Natural variations occur over tens of thousands of years, not over a hundred.
@Crossie94 @BarackObama who said a hundred? over 500 is more realistic.
@itsmeJohnStokes @BarackObama CO2 levels have only really started increasing recently, with temperatures matching the increase.
@Crossie94 @BarackObama the seasons will change,and are heading that way. its mother nature,nothing else.
@itsmeJohnStokes @BarackObama Temperatures would be getting colder if it was all natural cycles, not warmer.
@Crossie94 @BarackObama natural cycles are hot and cold,not one way.
@itsmeJohnStokes I know but scientists can predict entirely natural conditions based off Milenkovitch cycles which show we should be cooling
@BarackObama @apvermeulen What does he feel? Warming stopped 12 years before his presidency
@BarackObama hey Mr. President, does the world knows that in S. Paulo BR, we now have about 8% Of our water reserve? #Climate2014

@BarackObama stop fucking spending trillions on wars and nuclear weapons and funding Israel and fucking use that money for climate change.
@BarackObama shouldn't we be worrying more about the genocide Isis is starting? Or is that something you don't want to deal with.
Got kids? MT @BarackObama: We're the 1st generation to feel the effect of climate change & the last generation who can do something about it

@BarackObama Next generation feel bad about us since we are doing more against nature and Who will forgive us?
@BarackObama the climate change is completely natural and preventing mother Earth from doing it's job is a bad idea.
@BarackObama you can't do anything about a plants lifecycle, it's inevitable. Everything has its time and everything must end
@BarackObama @HuffingtonPost feel the effect? How? When?  Is it hotter? Nope! Has the sea risen? Errr.. NOPE! Oh you mean higher taxation!!
@BarackObama @HuffingtonPost Id love to agree, we do need to change, a lot, but the damage is done and another ice age is inevitable. :)
@BarackObama did you know that gradual climate change is a historical recurrence and our continents are constantly shifting placement so
@BarackObama #StopBombingAroundTheWorld and climate is save!!!
@BarackObama The time to act is now. I remember Toronto & Kyoto Protocols. USA is the greatest culprit for the emission of greenhouse gases!
@BarackObama I hope so,what we need more is action.
@BarackObama @HuffingtonPost 
President is getting close to sounding like Al Gore!  Polar ice cap was supposed to be gone by 2014.  Oops?
@BarackObama absolutely true. Action now. I like the gesture from the Rockeffelors for putting 50 billion dollars towards cleaner energy.
@BarackObama Yes! Time for change!
