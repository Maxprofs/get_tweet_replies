@jimtankersley you will go down as the best president in History!
Bill created more jobs than Obama, open your eyes. And he is no Reagan for sure.
you have not clue,really
clearly you are brain washed.
if you are a trumptard and he wins ,Nuclear war here we come
I'm a libertarian. Hillary wins we become communist.
I am a centerist,Trump encourages violence,brings out the worst people any intelligent person will see that
69 year old with oxygen gets hit in head by trump supporter,what is that ?if he wins they can do anything? dangerous Trump
.@BarackObama 

And we're trillions more in debt.

Not that you'd notice, sniveling sackless manlet.
If you hadn't noticed the economy is doing much better than it was 8 years ago. A stronger economy is key.
Debt carries interest, my friend.

Mortgaging the nation for future entitlements is suicidal.
During Obama's terms, there was less Federal income. That was due to lower tax receipts during the recession & Bush tax cuts.
So I believe that calling him a "sackless manlet" for a problem he had no control over is unjust.
I do not call him a sackless manlet out of economic considerations, but for his demonstrated absent resolve and pandering idiocy.
although all of our problems haven't been solved I hope that you will eventually appreciate all that he has done for the US.
like what? No job growths, inner cities blowing up , Isis killing Christians, illegals & Syrians taking Amer jobs & on & on.Wake up
@jimtankersley yeah, rule of averages. So try again.
actually this is a) median not average and b) for a year not covered in that chart.
median is the statistical average. If the top 1% go up the median does too
the chart you posted was "average" income. which is different from median income. thanks for engaging.
just like the number of workers in the pool can have false readings on "median" incomes.
what exactly are you contending here?
I answered you in another tweet
fake numbers!
jobs and imigration
only what's recorded. There are many off the books
yes nice one https://goo.gl/MlPgN2 
@jimtankersley just one year out of your 8 year Presidency.
