@Interior @lagunadeb @NatlParkService we had to pay before? I thought the land belonged to the people.
@AcerKahn @Interior @NatlParkService we always have to pay2park in city,county,state&federal parks. Some parks have fees to cover maintain
@lagunadeb @Interior @NatlParkService again, sarcasm and satire lost
@AcerKahn I thought it was a serious question. Kinda lame, but I always try to take people seriously until I get to know them.
@lagunadeb Jonathan Swift and I always get a bad rap
@AcerKahn well, as long as you don't eat your children I can communicate with you.
@lagunadeb I eat potatoes
@AcerKahn Irish or red potatoes?
