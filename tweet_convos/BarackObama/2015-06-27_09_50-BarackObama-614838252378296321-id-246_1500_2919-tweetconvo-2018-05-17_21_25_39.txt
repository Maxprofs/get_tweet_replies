@TheBlackKratos @BarackObama Agreed.  Keep it flying.  See https://twitter.com/johnnycrips/status/614920725560832001 ….
@johnnycrips @BarackObama lol cos that's what the people using the flag wanted it to mean, it's a disgrace
@TheBlackKratos @BarackObama Exactly.  People need to change their minds with regards as to what it represents.
@johnnycrips @BarackObama the flag is a disgrace and that country needs to adopt a German attitude towards that flag

@BarackObama  Negotiating with Congress better than unilateral executive orders that are inconclusive&uncertain!
@BarackObama this jackass blames everyone but himself! Cannot wait for you to be gone... sorry! Just true!
@BarackObama Major corporations get our manufacturing done in Mexico but the people can't live in USA. CATCH 22, new plan create program.
@BarackObama The problem with Immigration is there is no concrete plan. It should be reformed with VISA, work, and citizen goal. Proactive.
@BarackObama  It's also made us look dumb and increased the rancor & acrimony caused by the GOp rhetoric & agenda. SHAMEFUL
@BarackObama The failure of Obama to enforce immigration laws IS the issue!
@BarackObama I am an American living in British Colombia,seeing a very fair immigration law that helps them harvest cranberries.
@BarackObama and how many trillion has B. O. added to the national debt
@BarackObama #ImmigrationAction keep trying don't rest. It's for the benefit of lots of people. To congress don't just think about yourself.

@BarackObama 
thanks for pushing on.  best.  Rebecca sucgang ocampo
@BarackObama invest and develop your neighbouring countries so that they will not come to your country.
"@BarackObama :Over the past two years, the House’s failure to take #ImmigrationAction has cost the country $26.8 billion."
@BarackObama explain how that was allowed?? That's not money you just throw away!!
@BarackObama But we don't know just 1$

@BarackObama#MSG kick to drugs
@BarackObama From East Turkmenistan
@BarackObama How much more has Congress cost this country financially, emotionally & spiritually due to its bumbling & inaction!
@BarackObama I was moved by what you said and did in the funeral in Charleston. Truly Presidential
@BarackObama Its me President Obama, just wanted to know if u thought about the free 2 year College. It would help a lot of Americans
@BarackObama  Hi President Barack Obama, just want to say I think u r a great President and doing a Great Job for Our Country.
@BarackObama hello sir  gangadharan india kerala mob 0091 9747630909
@BarackObama Build a wall now!
@BarackObama .plus how much fighting Obama Care, plus equal rights for gay!! republicans wasting our money!
@BarackObama Here's what your lack of enforcement is costing. Deport illegal aliens. Secure the border.
@BarackObama because u invite them here & give them everything #idiot u keep wasting our tax $ on them instead of using for Americans!
@BarackObama ACT, Congress.
@BarackObama 
many don't buy your BS
@BarackObama great to hear from someone who has almost doubled deficit
@BarackObama Sigh.   If Congress would stay in session more than 6 months a yr, maybe they could act on these vital issues.
@BarackObama That's because you refuse to uphold the laws passed. Instead you give them free welfare we pay for.
@BarackObama this is shocking
@BarackObama GOP only cares about the 1% that's why!They conveniently forget we are a nation of immigrants!
@BarackObama and how much did his greedy aunt get for all the years here illegally?
@BarackObama OMG
@BarackObama can we figure out a way to deport @realDonaldTrump? That would be some real immigration reform!  Thanks!
@BarackObama bruh
@BarackObama there's a thought. Bail out Greece. Stop Putin becoming a major player in souther europe. Maybe. Regards
@BarackObama what else could you do with 28 billon. Slovenia could do with 2. Get us outta the dodo concerning Greece.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Congress is plagued with argument and inaction. Limit terms for Congressmen and women.
@BarackObama the real cost of procrastination & heads up to EU
@BarackObama let Andrew  Cuomo. Take over the NY school we have a better chance its not about the kids its about a profit
@BarackObama  We need comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform to make us safer&economically stronger simultaneously!
@BarackObama I see you're improving at this "making up numbers" game. $26.8B is much more believable than $26B
@BarackObama ADD 25 BILLION TO THAT FOR SHUTTING DOWN GOVT.. IT SEEMS WE CAN NOT AFFORD THE GOP WITH THE PURSE STRINGS. TAX $ SPENT ON NADA.
@BarackObama sorry sir for blank tweet
@BarackObama
@BarackObama that is just ridiculous!
@BarackObama hey

@BarackObama: "Over the past two years, the House’s failure to take #ImmigrationAction has cost…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=614838252378296321 …

@BarackObama u and your contry  are terorists u make the zare and muslims pay it is that fair
@BarackObama that's the Rep. Party for ya, hates change.
@BarackObama you can legalize marijuana and gay marriage but not give hard working people papers... Yeah the system is fucked up. 
@BarackObama When the ancestors came and took them, how much was cost
@BarackObama no u cost us that by opening the borders
@BarackObama Takes time! :)
@BarackObama If he won't help his own people why would he help immigrants.  OBAMA FAILURE TO ACT AGAIN.
@BarackObama Thanks #vonderharr
@BarackObama #educate #america #reschedule #medicalcannabis #medicalmarijuana
@BarackObama Obama not interested in immigration reform,  he was more interested in homosexual shit. He's under cover Homo!
@BarackObama #3%federalraise #BelieveAgain #ImmigrationAction #lovewins #everythingcounts
@BarackObama Twisting reality to progress the Agenda 21. This account sounds like CNN (ConstructedNonsenseNews).
@BarackObama working mode is ON!!
@BarackObama please don't stop border hoppers!!
“@BarackObama: Over the past two years, the House’s failure to take #ImmigrationAction has cost the country $26.8 billion.”
@BarackObama It would have been cheaper to close the border to illegal aliens !!!
@BarackObama it's worth it! Keeping illegals out and avoiding them taking MORE from us like WELFARE
@BarackObama Ojalá un día pueda visitar nuestro país Uruguay. Sería un orgullo!!!
@BarackObama ... Question: For some there's a profit to be made on employees with no rights ... do you think they are obstructing justice..?
@BarackObama ... I only ask because, if the plan passed ... what would happen is "an increase in consumption, job creation and tax revenue."
@BarackObama ... 3 things good for a nation's economy ... not to mention ... a subtraction to government spending ... which is an issue most
@BarackObama ... opposing the bill say they want from their government ... more in and le$$ out?
@BarackObama but insted of that you achieve the gay marriage for all Gringos. Macho Latino must became gay according your ratio Barack.
@BarackObama immigration also needs to be more efficient , it is just unbelievable the time some people have to wait for their cases.
@BarackObama it should follow suit from yesterday's BIG win.
@BarackObama good idea but how did you arrive at the number? Show the people please.
@BarackObama Spend the money on fixing a long-time broken immigration system! #TheTimeIsNow  Millions of deserving families need relief now!
@BarackObama 
what about the unnecessary black budget? 
Or the unaccounted for trillions missing?
How about we audit the fed?
@BarackObama but still have children in the streets starving here on our own soil. As well as childhood cancer growing with counts falling.
@barackobama I hope the government does not fail
pack
@BarackObama To fix the immigration first have to fight the Mafia who bring them in and make their home country to live without problems 
@BarackObama how is this calculated/estimated?  Serious q?
@BarackObama That is only because you let everyone stay and taxpayers have to foot the bill to support them
@BarackObama A leader doesn't point fingers; a leader works with with his team to accomplish what need to be done, work together
@BarackObama I don't support the actions of congress that cost the country money
@BarackObama "That sounds sad sir. Do you have Presidential Psychotherapy Support in your #AffordableCareAct ?"
@BarackObama U will b counting $ while ur nation will be #Lovewins with no procreation & depend on surrogate poor mothers? Slavery reinvent?
