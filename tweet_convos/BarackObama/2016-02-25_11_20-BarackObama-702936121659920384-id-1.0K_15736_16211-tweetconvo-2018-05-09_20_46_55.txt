@BarackObama I'm french but I'm also interested in the political life of another country and I agree with you.
@pauline07119255  France is being taken over by refugees opening up no go zones and Obama wants to do the same thing here. #dontbeapuppet
@ScottMichaels31 refugees are humans and they need our help.
@pauline07119255 agreed but Mecca has 2,000,000 places that aren't being used. You should not be afraid to walk your own country's streets.
@ScottMichaels31 of course. But your president is a good and responsable person. Our president in France makes a lot of mistakes...
@pauline07119255 agreed, I just don't want them repeated here.
@ScottMichaels31 I agree with your president because even if I'm not american, everyone can live free and too many people have arms against
@pauline07119255 I have arms because I'm free. I can protect my family. Those rights should not be tread upon.
. @BarackObama retweet if you think all Obama does is play games with our future.
@PoliticalCow @BarackObama That is called Conservative projection.
. @mikebank53 @BarackObama where do I start? He hangs minimum wage over our heads getting the unwashed masses all up in arms #gametime
@PoliticalCow @BarackObama If people were earning a living wage, that would put more money into the economy, and it wouldn't raise prices.
. @mikebank53 @BarackObama McD example - each burger breaks down as follows: $1 meant, $1 bun, $1 labor. Say it takes 1 HR per burger...
@PoliticalCow @mikebank53 @BarackObama wait on an answer. But don't hold your breath.
. @boaomega22 @mikebank53 @BarackObama honestly there is no answer to paying a McD's #SandwichArtist $100 per hour :)
. @boaomega22 @mikebank53 @BarackObama so inflation is a funny thing that overtime will devalue a currency. Takes more to buy the same thing
@BarackObama @sjmadsen this tweet is a political game
@jasonkarns @BarackObama @sjmadsen this is actually pretty unprecedented I believe. Filibuster, yes. Not refusal to consider before named.
@markstansbury @barackobama @sjmadsen the dems in 92 refused to take action at all and let a bunch of nominations expire
@jasonkarns @BarackObama @sjmadsen on a Supreme Court nominee? Tons of lower federal seats are never filled. But refusing to act on SCOTUS?!
@markstansbury @barackobama @sjmadsen basing it on case load, leaving circuit court seats open may be worse b/c it affects backlog more
@jasonkarns @BarackObama @sjmadsen no doubt they all need to be filled, but SCOTUS is qualitatively different.
@markstansbury @sjmadsen enough so that you think the reverse wouldn’t happen EXACTLY AS IT IS? this is all a game and SCOTUS isn’t special
@jasonkarns @sjmadsen they've had the opportunity and not done this. Depending how it plays out, they will now though.
Scalia was an ass!
OR Any of the Other MAJOR Issues that face us!
@BarackObama You've already done enough #harm to #America. #GoAway
: Lady take a look in the mirror. You are looking at DEPLORABLE!!!
Lady... look in the mirror @GwenBradley16, you're most probably a paid #egg. @BarackObama
He specifically read your tweet out of the hundreds of thousands that he probably gets every hour......Why do u even bother???
Because someone will read it...
shut up and be gone already!
@BarackObama "Do your job"?  YOU calling on others to do their job.  That's funny and ironic.
you werent doing your job whilst running around campaigning for skank HRC.  just getvoutvnow and let us fix the US
You have kept us all safe and thank you for your hard work.You are an inspiration around the world. We will miss you.
Sucks to suck
That's why we must #uniteblue in Nov! It's abt more than pers. preference. It's abt health of our country (as a Bernie voter).
Is Bannon covering up reapproachment with DPRK because he wants DPRK to hack voter data?
@bmars88 good achievment u are the best
Agree!!
@DoloresHuerta totally agree.  Go with the candidate who firmly beats Trump
@TearsInHeaven09 

They haven't done their job in 8 years. They aren't about to start now.
@BarackObama @DoloresHuerta @FoxNews Obama needs liberalJudge to help continue to hideHis secrete lost Fast&FuriousGuns1000's mex GENOCIDE
@BarackObama @mtmcelvy  He's done enough damage to the country already
You should say that if Hillary wins in November you'll let her pick the next justice and you'll pull Garland.
@BarackObama @janet_sistare So called "progressive" POTUS "doing his job" by nominating a Republican for Supreme Court - yeah fucking right
@skepticsauce @BarackObama 
Nah, I think that was just a name floated to show how intransigent the GOP is being.
@janet_sistare @BarackObama I hope you're right! It would be highly upsetting if he was serious.
@BarackObama @DoloresHuerta treason
@BarackObama @DoloresHuerta Your pick is pro Citizens United votes against the people of United States
@BarackObama 
Yes sir!
@BarackObama @suz_hol #ArrestMitchMcConnell for lying under oath, obstruction of justice,refusing to do his job, racist bigotry 
@BarackObama @CoreyPysher   TELL THAT TO THE DUCK DYNASTY FOLKS...FOUND IN ANY DONALD, CRUZ OR BERNIE CROWD.
@BarackObama thank you for doing the right thing.  you are the president!!!!
@BarackObama kone
@BarackObama
@BarackObama your 100% spot on. One must do their assigned jobs until the end if not it's dereliction of Duty.
@BarackObama I like you so much, every day I pray for you and I have a dream to know you some day. Good bless you Mr.President
@BarackObama Great choice for nominee....now if Paul Ryan would get his cronies to do what they are paid to do....then Garland can do his!

@BarackObama @DoloresHuerta your job was never completed.
@BarackObama #Isurehopetheydo
@BarackObama you are absolutely correct!!
@BarackObama @reevynap POTUS has high hopes.The only job they've been doing since he FIRST took office was to undermine/block/undo his job.
@BarackObama No matter what is going on in your life, never lose hope.  Stay positive , stay humble in good times, and always trust Allah.
@BarackObama thank u for all u do. The #Senate needs to do their job.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama go get them
@BarackObama @cassandra17lina Obstruction should result in taking back the House and Senate. GOP actions have consequences. Retire McConnell

@BarackObama @Jim_Fondriest he hasn't done his job in over 7 Years, why start now?
@BarackObama If the POTUS nominates Supreme Court Judge and the Senate doesn't hold confirmation hearings, isn't that an implicit yes vote?
@BarackObama no lame duck appointments. just leave
