@OFA yug gupta. .  
You are the superb
Hi
I'm confused. I thought the Supreme Court is the best arena for partisan political games. That's why voting is important
What about the other shit I want????
less then 6 months left
#Ronaldgod
OBMはいっ！OBMはいっ！BMIじゃないよ？オ！バ！マ！
yeah, supreme court is no place for partisan 'political' games, in any country.
@OFA Court is definitely not a place for political shenanigans.
U were voted in bc of PC, we gave u a double chance & still you FAILED, u got where u are bc of race nothing else u must know
sir awesome look and thoughtful
ok @BarackObama but this is racial politics as proven by nomination of @realDonaldTrump racist comprise large % of republican base
agreed but I also think a Dem President should pick a more liberal nominee than Merrick, who isn't even against citizens united
صنيفره
clowns to the left and jokers to the right sounds like the dnc
:PRESIDENT OBAMA, For AMERICA please do NOT give any TOP-SECRETS to Donald trump nor Paul mannfort! Because Of Putin & Russia.

that's hilarious coming from you. All you do is play partisan and race politics#greatdivider
Yes, I agree, its only when you sit behind the desk that is when you do the job lol
God bless you always and your family, and don't over eat on the cake, go easy on it lol :)
Happy Birthday Mr President, Can Michelle run for president after the 8 year term? She's Brilliant :)

@OFA  I AGREE!
@OFA  now every political asylum requested by the former
Where can I sign to have you and your disrespectful family removed from OUR house???? I will sign that one!
@OFA 
Seriously you said that lol
@OFA I will add my name to impeach Obama the pig, and arrest Clinton the crook
hey
Please dedicate your time to these ideas. System is broken. Work on them after you leave office please! Faith in our nation!
@OFA I support your effort but I am not going to donate because I am not American so I am not a direct stakeholder.
INC. should not have any influence whatsoever, and PACs, Super PACs, Pac-Man should be abolished. Just Citizen representation!!
The Way to a more represented society is thru Parliamentary style allocation. Winner takes All + Citizens United is a disaster!
The US constitution has its flaws. The SCOTUS is a disgrace, they should have term limits and be based on Merit /Congress!
#Liar #flipflop
@OFA
be patient !! Had less...
That should be Easley said you don't
@BarackObama
@OFA we are respect u
The court is as political as it can be. Presidents should never nominate judges, AG or supreme court  members. Internal Merit!
then if you feel that way stay out of the court system. Just become a citizen and see what you think.
@OFA Ho busca un gran lugar de lo desconocido Por la magia y el espiritismo Seguro un templos de mil maravillas A su lados
@OFA nope!
:President Obama, why doesn't the RNC OR GOP DO SOMETHING TO STOP TRUMP?
RNC THAT AFRAID OF TRUMP? ARE GOP COWARDS?
Ex USA NAVY
Hillary said we must continue supporting Israeli . Which is unfair to the Palestines . This show how rotten Hillary Clinton is
Barack Obama for supreme court justice!

@OFA
@OFA I'm thinking, Hillary, when she wins and is appointed the presidency in January,... That she nominates Barack Obama
@OFA yes
I hardly know anyting about US Mr.Presiden  have never been there or in Chicago saw a little bit of that in Richard Gere movie/
dude you have weird goals..
@OFA Isn't SCOTUS supposed to make decisions based on the Constitution and not along party lines?
how is this seat still vacant? Can u just appoint someone already so we can move onto some of the BIGGER problems we have!
No thanks Obama.  We can wait for the next President.
Clarence Howell caseyhowell2@gmail.com
@OFA why should partisan allowed in justice institutions when we do depend on them
except when you're trying to pass healthcare "reform" right?
You choose a right person Mr. Barack Obama.
@OFA a time deadline to nominate should be in place to properly keep the government working.
then don't stack the court with Liberal Democrats.
@OFA I'm more worried about our democratic election process's right now. Are they legit? We don't know, no audits.
@OFA 0
@OFA I believe that holding up the nomination breaks the separation of powers concept of our government.
Ok #Barack I'll give #JudgeMerrickGarland a Fair & Just Hearing to #FixTheSystem & end #PartisanPoliticalGames #TalkinSunDragon

@OFA respect your country and its processes.  Playing political games with our processes and laws is UN-AMERICAN!
@OFA:Are you not allowed to make a recess appointment?
@OFA orlando Pereira
You mean kind of like most of the appointments themselves?
I agree, which is why I think you should shut up about it until the new President takes office.
Not Only Muslim Terrorist They Abused Muslim Name's Their r Only Enemy Of Mankind No Religious Person To Kill a Libes Of Masses
@OFA so stop playing games and deceiving and conspiring against the populace, stop being so divisive
@OFA the democrats started the partisan political game,#novote#nohearing.period!
@OFA I agree
@OFA the Senate has a clear disrespect for the president and it is quite frankly disgusting!
we need a judge that better reflects the values of the future - a progressive Native judge
@OFA ...forget it, president Trump will take care of it. ..
@OFA sou brasileira, moro no Brasil mas isto é prática no mundo todo - MÁ PRÁTICA !!!
@OFA this is not what the founding fathers intended.  President nominates, Senate approves. Respect the process.
@OFA yeah
get rid of your guns, get rid of your racists and get rid of that clown trump, you are becoming a laughing stock America.
I'll add my name that your partisan politics in slobbering all over Muslim terrorists is costing us too many American lives!
