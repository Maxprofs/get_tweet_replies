@BarackObama And crack use has gone up 1000% in the White House
RT @BarackObama: "The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been president." —President Obama
@ECantoni @BarackObama @zerohedge Debt, deficit, what's the difference?
@JohnWaggoner @ECantoni @BarackObama @zerohedge Deficit = annual shortage. Debt = total of annual deficits.
@traderskillset @ECantoni @BarackObama @zerohedge Tweet was about deficit. Chart showed debt. Thought you were confused.
@BarackObama is all your going to ever talk about is what you think youve done when you really havent done shit
@BarackObama Is it ever truly possible for you the #Tell_The_Truth?? or do you just lie all the time??
@BarackObama hahahaha! You lie.
“@BarackObama: "The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been president." —President Obama”@ScottPaterno is this common core math?
@lmp999 @BarackObama basically that would be like me gaining 20 pounds this month and bragging for losing 15 of it.
@BarackObama And the National Debt doubled? #fuzzymath
@BarackObama Look at the budget busting spendthrift trying to self-identity as a prudent budget hawk. #TransEconomic
@BarackObama Put it on a big banner Mr. President. Insist on telling the American people.
“@BarackObama: "The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been president." —President Obama”
@BarackObama that is not true!!!
@BarackObama In what country?
@BarackObama And deficit doubled compared to all previous President's combined. Don't hurt anything patting yourself on the back, champ.
@BarackObama Too bad that happened. We should be growing the deficit since demand has not yet created a full employment economy.
@BarackObama excuse me lies The deficit?? Your still making cuts and budgets.
@BarackObama liar!!! WTH??? 18 trillion-- u did horrible in math my friend
@BarackObama  Yea right it is 20 trillion now!
@BarackObama lie after lie after lie.
@BarackObama you can't use cutting military funding to pay for your shitty health care as justification for a lower deficit
@BarackObama you lie so boldly when the facts are out there for ANYONE to see, Mr. president? #tcot #tiot #tlot
@BarackObama you do well, congratulations !
@BarackObama Yes, but the animal abuse continues to climb & judges continue to give out small sentences and you just smile.
@BarackObama liar
Of course, that's AFTER @BarackObama more than doubled the deficits first. Four back-to-back TRILLION DOLLAR deficits
@SoquelCreek @DoubleEagle49 @BarackObama Of course only reduced by #FannieGate billions!
@BarackObama well you can get rid of it if you sign the Republican budget.
@RiseForRubio @BarackObama loool

@BarackObama what kind of crack are you smoking? That shit must be amazing. I think you meant you INCREASED the deficit by 2/3. #mathishard
.@BarackObama did the unicorn tell you that?
@BarackObama That is impossible!  Fuzzy Math again!
Remember when @BarackObama called Bush's Debt "unpatriotic" & "irresponsible"? Then THIS happened.
@BarackObama there is no deficit ....how can we owe ourselves .....just dismiss it already..... as for owing other countries...it's a lie
@BarackObama How bout the national debt  http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
@BarackObama Senate says ‘NO’ to Obama’s $4 trillion budget in 1-98 vote.

You had NOTHING to do with it.

@BarackObama You guys using Common Core math or...?
@BarackObama But, the debt has gone up 7-fold!  Nice job!
@BarackObama This is like when stores double their prices on Thursday and have a 50% off sale on the weekend!
@BarackObama lannn hep aynı yalan bizde de var senden bi örnek bi bitmediniz a.q
@BarackObama After you raised it to new highs...hmmmm...with a democratic congress.
@BarackObama GWB's yrs of high deficits only due to a free spending dem controlled congress, Your reduction only due to GOP controlled one.
@BarackObama OH REALLY ?
@BarackObama But yet you increase the National Debt by over $11 Trillion.  More than all other presidents combined.
@BarackObama Really? You hanging out with the  CHOOM gang again?
@BarackObama Only if you count it from bringing down your 4 yrs of $Trillion+ deficits to one yr that is still higher than any other prez.
"The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been president." @BarackObama More Common Core math.
@BarackObama YOU FUCKING LIER
@BarackObama You Lie!
You're the one that blew it up with the stimulus and cash for clunkers. Can't take credit for reducing something you created. @BarackObama
@BarackObama The 18Trillion Dollar Man. Col. Steve Austin is so jealous.
@BarackObama After 6 YEARS we've finally removed the "one time spending" from the 2009 budget and are 50% over 2008 levels? Hooray?
@BarackObama You DO know the difference between debt and deficit, right?

Since 2008 you've added $8T to the US DEBT.

All. By. Yourself.
@BarackObama Not true. It's still over half a trillion. If you're bragging over that accomplishment, you need to set the bar a little higher
@BarackObama:  Whose signature is on the 2009 Budget?
@BarackObama This is why I despise you.  The truth means nothing to you and you play with numbers.
And yet it is still larger than any under Bush @BarackObama #GoFigure
@BarackObama Absolute nonsense. You alone have nearly eight trillion to debt. That isn't a decrease by any standard.
@BarackObama "In explaining Obama, we've gone from 'Common Core' to 'Stupid to the Core' since he's been president!" - Me.
@BarackObama Now that we have a Republican Congress. You're Welcome!

“@BarackObama: "The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been president." —President Obama”. On what planet?
Then-Senator @BarackObama became part of the MAJORITY PARTY on 1/3/2007 & inherited FY 2007 deficit < $161B, = 1.1% of GDP.
@TheDemocrats (including @BarackObama)
↑ deficit 791% in just 2 years,
from 1.1% of GDP in FY 2007 to 9.8% of GDP in FY 2009!
*ALL* FY 2009 spending was passed by Pelosi & Reid,
and the overwhelming majority was requested by @BarackObama, not Bush!
.@BarackObama requested:

FY Deficit as % GDP:
2004 3.4
2007 1.1, ↓68% after 2003 Bush Tax Cuts
2009 9.8, ↑791% Pelosi/Reid/@BarackObama 
2015 3.2, ↑191% since 2007
Claim "The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I've been president" relies on blaming Bush for Pelosi/Reid/@BarackObama's 2009 deficit
Pelosi/Reid/@BarackObama's FY 2009 deficit = 9.8% of GDP was nearly NONUPLE (9X!) the deficit they inherited in FY 2007 = 1.1% of GDP
The Boehner/Reid/@BarackObama FY 2015 deficit is estimated to be 3.2% of GDP, still nearly TRIPLE the FY 2007 deficit of 1.1% of GDP.
@BarackObama Nope
@BarackObama @zerohedge but the debt keeps rising. "How high's the water mama?"
@BarackObama flat out lying mother fucker.
@BarackObama @zerohedge ..great, suck money out of the economy during a recession.. nice move Barry

@varun_prakash97 @BarackObama saying unemployment has gone down is misleading since most of the jobs being created are part time
