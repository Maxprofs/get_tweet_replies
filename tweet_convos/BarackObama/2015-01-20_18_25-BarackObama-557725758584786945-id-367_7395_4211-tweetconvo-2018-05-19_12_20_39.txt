@BarackObama Obama has destroyed the Middle Class, you hack. Household income down, labor participation rate lowest since Jimmy Carter
@SPQRzilla @BarackObama Say it enough and even you might believe it.  YOu are full of shit like the rest of your sorry know nothing party!
@julescator @BarackObama Are you entirely ignorant of basic economics? Do you pay any attention to the economic news?
@SPQRzilla Here's basic economics - the US economy is 70% consumer spending and 30% business spending. There is NO business w/o consumers!
@julescator What an incoherent clueless non sequitur. 

 Here is reality: Even ABC News says Obama is full of shit:
@SPQRzilla Oh yea I'm clueless.  I'm not conversing with Einstein here!  I have dumbed down to your level, which is tough!  Get lost clown!
@julescator Obama's only success - the wealth of corrupt crony Democrat billionaires.
@SPQRzilla I don't see the Dems helping a foreign country take land from Americans for a dirty pipeline! You are full of chit!
@therealmomofoc @BarackObama When the GOP crashes the econ they do a helluva job.  Of course people suffered.  BTW - what planet r u from?
@therealmomofoc I live here and worked at Merrill Lynch at the time of the crash - supposed I educate YOU on economics & CDOs & AIG! ready?
@therealmomofoc The you have to know that the mortgages were packaged by the thousands to suit investors but lost track of the owners.
@therealmomofoc banks were not FORCED to take bad loans - they turned mortgages into investment vehicles and got greedy!
“@BarackObama: Retweet if u agree with Pres Obama. #SOTU ” agree there has been a verdict, last Nov. people sd no to u
@jeffdmoore @BarackObama He wasn't running last NOV.  The GOP Gerrymandered themselves into office.  FACT is the Dems had MORE VOTES!
@julescator @BarackObama he said his policies were on the ballot!  His party lost more seats in congress than any other sitting Pres ever!
@jeffdmoore @BarackObama You need to stop listening to FOX and get the facts before you tweet nonsense!  That's my suggestion!
@julescator @BarackObama you liberals don't like facts do you?
@jeffdmoore at this point your commentary should rise above the GOP talking point level.
@BarackObama AKA Black Bush @bethbeauvais1 Sorry, I don't blindly agree with liars who support genocide and punish whistle blowers.
@TimBestbudz @BarackObama I don't blindly believe either. Frequently it's the dreaded lesser of 2 evils. But BO gets a lot right IMO.
@bethbeauvais1 I agree and disagree, because I still see the lesser of two evils as evil. I just want people > corporations or government.
@TimBestbudz Me too.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @Peacepox Thank you Me. President!!!!

@BarackObama @OfficialCBC Wow look at all the Sheeple.
@BarackObama @amuses The jobs are low paying jobs, they are 30 hour per week jobs which makes the jobs pay even less. Obama lies all around.
@BarackObama @erikblair http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/18/us-usa-obama-economy-idUSKBN0KR0HD20150118 …  Facts hurt that argument
@FLSurfGirl @BarackObama Looking backwards what we saw wasn't "middle-Class Economics" it was Unfettered Capitalism. Obama was looking ahead
@BarackObama @amuses Obama's SOTUS was "Do it my way or you are not cooperating."
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @amuses Obama is a total liar and all that shake his hand with pride are also liars or lovers of liars.
@EnkiSpeaking @BarackObama shut up & go away.
@amuses I know you are not telling me that. I know you mean Obama should shut up and go away.
@BarackObama lol you say it but you never do it!!!

@xylem44 @BarackObama By politics, you meant government..Right?
“@jermhudson: @xylem44 @BarackObama By politics, you meant government..Right?” Word I used was "POLICIES" (reading is not a partisan thing).
@xylem44 @BarackObama No probably not, but obviously, economics are. And robbing peter to pay paul, only corrupts peter and pisses of paul
Except we've been Peter being robbed by Paul to pay.... Himself for many decades now.  This does not change facts  @jermhudson @BarackObama
@xylem44 @BarackObama False, we robbed Peter, so Paul allowed himself to be robbed through legislation Paul wrote.
@BarackObama @Xavier_McCoo if it all "works" then why is America in more debt than it has ever been?
@BarackObama yes
@BarackObama Excellent SOTU address!
@BarackObama  Trickle down never worked but the GOP still believes in corporations and the rich first. Short-sighted & doesn't match data.
