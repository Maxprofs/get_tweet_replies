@WhiteHouse we're so thankful for Obama's ACA!
LOL. Yeah by being threatened and forced into buying from insurance cartels. Thanks, Congress.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I am so happy I have insurance I can afford. Will I be able to keep it in the future???
If you call 350 a month at 13k deductibles health insurance I don't think that is anything to be proud of.
If you want to make changes can help by repealing some mandates and open up the markets more would create competition
Yep
I am happy with my health care plan.
@BrakOBamma but it's NOT AFFORDABLE any more the premiums r outrageous! Can't afford it.. useless to me
@BrakOBamma now that major companies won't insure it's not so affordable is it!? Repeal and replace required
@WhiteHouse @BrakOBamma not what the CBO says
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Good job!Now it's time for single-payer and doing away with billionaires borne from disease and suffering. #Bernie
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama But how many people have been killed by guns since you been Pres.?
Arizona costs up 116% in 2007, what an excellent health care plan.
@BrakOBamma yes in me what
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yeah & if you aren't on Medicaid who the hell can afford it. The American people hate it!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and how many lost wages/hours due to the rising cost and were forced to other health care policies that were more $
@WhiteHouse this is misleading this is a false statement shame on CNN or the Fed stating this
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Depuis qu'il est au pouvoir, je rêve ardemment lui serer la main meme à juste à la dernière seconde de son mandat.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama great job dipshits!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Great job! The only leaves 22 million without coverage and untold millions more with increased costs. Way to go!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama not me, you guys fine me for what I didn't use or didn't know about
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama How is it that I dont qualify for Medicaid & with no income i dont qualify for Marketplace assistance?
@WhiteHouse I can't afford your affordable health insurance
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama LIAR! More have lost their insurance than gained.  The ones that gained it are paid by us taxpayers.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and I don't have any insurance now thanks to my skyrocketing premiums. What a joke
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it must only be the people unable/unwilling to work. Because it was cheaper for me to pay the fine. #ACAsucks
@WhiteHouse yes Free loaders that pimp the system to get what they can. Government too big...REVOLUTION COMING...
@WhiteHouse @MissFNP
@WhiteHouse  I now know what it is like to have no coverage that I can afford, thanks to you.
@WhiteHouse and over 200 million got screwed the needs of the few do not outweigh the needs of the many
@WhiteHouse thank you President Obama. I appreciate all that you do for our country. God bless you.

@WhiteHouse 
Too bad no one can afford the ridiculous deductibles your "plan" has created.
@WhiteHouse Thank you Obama admin 
@WhiteHouse Amazing what you can do when you make it mandatory or penalize people for not.
@WhiteHouse taking more of my tax money and violating my religious freedom.  Thanks
@WhiteHouse and the other 300 million are paying more. Much more. How is that 'affordable'?
@WhiteHouse But, how many are paying their bills???
@WhiteHouse @tpet57 Unless they vote GOP in the fall...
@WhiteHouse 20 million Americans gained health coverage thanks to the forcible care act.
@WhiteHouse That's because people like me that work is subsidizing them. They are not paying for it. It is free to them.
@WhiteHouse It's  worthless  insurance .
@WhiteHouse Our Kenyan son has made us proud, come back home when your duty is over.
@WhiteHouse @narendramodi Government is also launching a new health insurance scheme to provide health security 2 poor & middle class family
@WhiteHouse wife's son and daughter-in-law have a 2-mo old baby with congenital heart defect called Tetralogy of Fallot (to be continued)
@WhiteHouse Obama care has left them $20,000 in debt before the TOF surgery.
@WhiteHouse how many lost insurance because of it? Stop with the lies!
@WhiteHouse Coming soon: 20 million more American Jobs.
@WhiteHouse thank you so much for that.
@WhiteHouse and 20 million of us cant afford Rs  now
@WhiteHouse healthier families lead to healthier students in the classroom.  it is big gov't but sometimes our students benefit from it.
@WhiteHouse and millions probably had a rude awakening when they did their return and paid a penalty!
@WhiteHouse It was supposed to cover 47 million, not 20. So we're all paying more, endless hassles, losing our doctors, and the goal not met
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yes but they can't afford it! ACA is destroying our country. How long until the system is bankrupt? Then what idiot
@IanProut @WhiteHouse There is a big difference between a $500 deductible and a 75k bill to bankrupt a family
@IanProut agree it isn't perfect for sure, but it is much, much better
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Come O Holy Ghost Creator comes and bring peace on earth.
@WhiteHouse Sounds like you're counting people who would be covered anyway. Besides we were told 40 m Americans could get covered. 1/2 off
@WhiteHouse We were also told this bill would save Taxpayers 1.3 TRILLION dollars.
@WhiteHouse @cnn when we have corp.that make huge profits off our negative health issues.Who will pay.Polluted waters,soil,cancers,We WILL
@WhiteHouse I still can't afford to go to dr. If u don't use it we should get some money back.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Not me. We have to pay more now. We work so hard to make ends meet. Obama care works if you don't work
@WhiteHouse We did not vote to have our health brokered by insurance co.that profit off our health.@cnn
@WhiteHouse @donaldtrumpdbag #GOPdebate
@WhiteHouse thank you President Obama! We love you! Please don't allow the GOP greedies take our insurance! We will vote dem!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama but how many will vote to keep it?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #affordablehealthcare not really.  It is costing not saving, Its hurting and there is no cure in site
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and my healthcare went up to $100 per week. $400 per month almost a full paycheck. Thanks.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama And w insurance, my colonoscopy cost me an additional $2000. Luckily I could pay it. Having insurance isn't enough.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What a BUNCH of BULL$HIT! Many of those that 'gained insurance' are the same ones that LOST because of Obamacare!
@WhiteHouse bull shot
@WhiteHouse ...which is not that surprising since there is a hefty penalty on your taxes if you don't have health insurance
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama door k dhool suhanen
