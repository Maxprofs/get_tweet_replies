You must have gone to the same data source to think solar is practical as gun control, climate change and healthcare!LOL
in the solar industry is not profitable it is all being held up by the government with grants and subsidies ...
They have been turned Green with envy at those working for the Auto Industry?
They're doing such a good job helping the #economy, send them to the sun.
what about the solar companies that went bankrupt that taxpayers paid for
we also have a dismal labor participation rate
how many solar companies have gone bankrupt on tax payer dollars since you took office?
yeah.... But how many are still in it as the industry dies a slow death.
50,000 workers have been trained , but only 12 people are working, POTUS sucks
That's it?
150,000 ppl around the world will have died today. Is that also ur doing? More if u decide to bomb another hospital. ;)
why doesn't this acct talk about important issues?
yeah, but how many hVe lost their jobs???
@ENERGY @POTUS There are a lot of new ideas in the field of clean energy and new ideas in this area if we had the chance we can
@2tall4u2 @POTUS One word... Now pay attention... SOLYNDRA.
so they were trained but where did they go to work tell us that I trained to be a Welder but never used it
FACT:more police have died and more racial division since POTUS took office.
FACT: A scam paid for with $2 BILLION of our tax money.  #ActOnClimate   #solindra    http://trib.in/29YHqFg 
"trained to enter" have any entered?
are they working? Obama is a failure. It's to late to try and pat yourself on the back. Failure and I think he is realizing it
trying to spin the numbers. Only Obama. Give us  break. Big deal? No not really considering all the jobs lost. Counting the days
Bull hockey
oh really! How much solar $ has been lost from the tax payers and how many other jobs have been lost since he has been Pres.
but yet my husband and two sons have been out of work for three years
Yeah great...they were trained, but are they working. I know I'm not. Have upper level degrees and still can't get a job.
"Trained to enter..." Slick wording. How many actually have a job in the solar industry?
and 94million still don't have jobs
@POTUS@
And 45,000 are #Unemployed !!!
don't forget solyndra!
Thank you on behalf of @GreenskiesSolar; #solar needs more #engineers to fuel our growth @WhiteHouse @POTUS
God bless @POTUS
The worst gov. subsidy waste ever. If solar was the answer it could stand on it's own. Another fuck job by Obummer.
Great statistic, but we need more green energy jobs jobs that can't be exported
So, when will the solar industry be able to sustain itself w/o govt subsidies?What % is it contrubuting to the grid?
@congressdotgov Do Your Job! Convict!
Trained to enter, not entered.
I was trained but I don't have a job
"Trained" for the solar industry, but not "employed" by the solar industry. #Solyndra
the other "fact" is 75% of them were not Americans.
if there's 300million Civilians then that 50k is only .02% In 8 years so either hes not trying or unsocial
IGWEOCHA WOMEN LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN FOR BIAFRA RESTORATION, HAILS NNAMDI KANU http://dlvr.it/LqxjGn

Most of industry bankrupt w/leaders taking huge payouts -from projects funded by taxpayers...Solyndra ring a bell.
Hear that you coal mining states. There's your future. You are a fool if you believe Trump will 'bring back' dead coal.
and millions scammed from their homes with #makingyourhomeaffordable #scam
Yet he presented the Middle-East to Putin in a silver plate...
Anitonette Tuff was able to withstand the take over in Georgia, so can you. Remain faithful. You can do it. "Yes we can"
Obama Has Been The Best President since B. Clinton with all the challenges he faces and accomplished as President
Per The Atlanta Falcons, " Rise Up" Obama. Rise up....You cannot take the hate out of people's heart. Only God.
Even with Bush did the US did not show racist remarks. Why with Obama? He is the President where you like it or not.
inspite of the negative comm, keep your head up high. It has taken a toll on you. We are with you
Tell the American People how many BILLIONS of dollars were wasted by UNPAID back LOANS to big companies. #WakeUpAmerica!

And???
You know they do the cost-benefit analysis as though the sun is directly above 24/7/365? No Shit. http://www.justfacts.com/energy.asp#solar …
Thank you President Obama. We need more jobs.
But how many actually got good jobs? Since you didn't post that number it's got to be bad.
