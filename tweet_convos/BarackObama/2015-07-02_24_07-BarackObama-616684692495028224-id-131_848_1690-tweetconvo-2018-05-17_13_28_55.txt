@BarackObama LoL - what "40-hour work week"?
Me & mine all work at least 50 hrs/week and you tax the hell out of us.
@BoreGuru @BarackObama do you get paid any overtime?
@rdsxptscltsbrns @BarackObama Salary + Bonus, and the Bonus is tie to revenue and profits targets.
@BoreGuru @BarackObama I'm thinking this is directed more to the people who can't tap into a salary and no bonuses come with there companies
@rdsxptscltsbrns @BarackObama Starting pay with drilling contractors in the US is ~$25/hr. But have to pass pre-empl drug & physical tests.
@BoreGuru @BarackObama working in a pipefitters Union now treating me great!
@rdsxptscltsbrns @BarackObama Good. Too many fools going to college when the US is short of machinists & welders - those are fine jobs.
@Seven_Oaks_ @BarackObama Trade deficit yes but not national debt and all the Republicans love the unfair trade agreements
@Seven_Oaks_ @BarackObama Stop watching Fox and get educated
@BarackObama YES! Yes! Yesssss! But you won't let that System work!! Big Govt interference is the problem in many of these Labor issues!! YK
@YULANDAJONES @BarackObama Big Government = We The People those who are against big Government are against We The People
@TomAdler @BarackObama The term "Big Government" is not synonymous with Federal Govt, (cont) http://tl.gd/nk7gnb 
@YULANDAJONES we r in full agreement that is y every time I say Gov I say We The People in front of it bcause We The People are the Gov
@TomAdler Yes and No. Elaborate.
@BarackObama Unions are why everything I buy is FROM FUCKING CHINA
@BarackObama @Nick58672348 how bout a 30 hour work week 
@Bagger311 @BarackObama that would be nice! We. Work hard enough.. Jeb bush can pound sand!
@Nick58672348 @BarackObama I work 8-5 & home by 5:30. Bed by 10-11 so that gives me about 5 hours to do my own thing. #AmericasWorkHoursSuck
@JebBush u hear that #JebBush you buzzard and @BarackObama you know ur not a very good #POTUS, u actually stink at ur job. #YouKnowItTooLiar
@BarackObama even you cant be this stupid a raise for the workers at a fast food place means a pay cut for the small business owner
@BarackObama @freeradicalone Unions won the right of workers to be able to use the toilet,think about that.
@BarackObama Tell that to someone that is a plain freeloader also working In the work force.
@BarackObama the unions are responsible for more than just the 40 hour work week. What about vacation, sick time, breaks, safe  conditions
@BarackObama and they dont work now a days they do not award their best and brightest they`re lumped (by pay ) with every other member
@BarackObama with most all labor contracts containing a no strike clause, the union is basically useless
@BarackObama At our technological level, nobody should be working more than 20 hours a week.
@BarackObama -Unfortunately,  The unions made healthcare more expensive.
@BarackObama @julestw9 So what's the point of public sector unions? Roosevelt opposed the idea.
@BarackObama @mch7576 kinda sad that you ignored #WI during the Walker recall and when those Unions truly needed you.
@BarackObama who wants to work 40 hours a week. Why cant we lower that to 32 so we have time for our families and a life outside of work.
@BarackObama Unions are so old school, why get stuck in the past?
@BarackObama word
I am finding it difficult to speak to anyone else.
@BarackObama but what have they done for America since the 1930s though
@barackobama *The #WORLD hear our voice*;free us from the animal kingdom(zoo) called Nigeria. We are BIAFRANS. #BIAFRA #IPOB #RADIOBIAFRA
@BarackObama No. The pioneer of the 40 hour workweek was actually a businessman that also paid his workers well. Unions just took credit.
@BarackObama sounds a leader concerned,  TX
@BarackObama or that old favorite THE WEEKEND. #unionyes #workersrights
@BarackObama And the over priced goods, lousy education and union dues.
@BarackObama so is grey hound and trailways the maintense side
@BarackObama very true, mr.President!
@BarackObama I iLifef
@BarackObama ha! Union workers and gov workers are prob the only ones working <40 hr weeks...
@BarackObama  do not give me any credit to follow me. I will  not appiriciate
@BarackObama I'm pro union but actually Henry Ford did that. If owners were like Ford we wouldn't need unions. Give Ford his due.
@BarackObama don't forget we have 93 million not working and chicago teacher's union borrowing 1 BILLION dollars to pay pensions!
@BarackObama Workers need advocates. Unfortunately one cannot wait on the genorosity of business owners. They need pressure to be just.
@BarackObama Unions only account for 6 % of the work force and those over paid teamsters are the reason for over priced goods!!!!
@BarackObama this is why they've been deliberately destroyed around the world..
@BarackObama хватит засирать ленту!
@BarackObama unions have also caused the loss of jobs when union demands become painful for the employer sending jobs elsewhere
@BarackObama after many of them were murdered by cops, yes.
@BarackObama  You are so right. If not for unions , most people of color would not have a descent job. GO UNIONS! !!
@BarackObama then kept us down at the 24 hour work week so they didn't have to offer insurance....
@BarackObama You did good ! if you were white maybe better. You couldn't make big changes to risk been the first black & worst president.
@BarackObama @quarterflash14 the people who brought us the Weekend
@BarackObama a They also helped drive GM into a condition where they needed a government bailout
@BarackObama AND workplace safety laws!

@BarackObama No teacher works only 40 hours; we are professionals and deserve professional compensation.
President @BarackObama is quoting himself.

#Fact
@barackobama 

…and Republicans ended slavery.
@BarackObama I feel like all your tweets are going to be put together into a speech
@BarackObama Union strong
@BarackObama Too many unions have gone awry: fat-cats, short sighted, compete AGAINST constituents' best interests. Look to Denmark's model.
@SEOmom @BarackObama A people are democracy. But each association which should help a people will be hotbed of communism.
@BarackObama And you gave us the <30 hour work week...jackass.
@BarackObama the people who brought you the weekend!
@BarackObama ~True. Now basically *stealing* from it's own members, intimidating the innocent & showing little interest in it's moral start.
@BarackObama follow me bro
@BarackObama: And killed injured many people unless everyone did what they were ordered to do.
@BarackObama 
And stopped child labor atrocities.
