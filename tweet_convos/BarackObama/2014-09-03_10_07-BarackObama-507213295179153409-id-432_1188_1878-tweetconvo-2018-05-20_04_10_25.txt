@BarackObama YOU ALL DO WHAT YOU KNOW IS RIGHT NO ONE CAN STOP YOU
@BarackObama This is moment for House rethug leadership tp lead & pass the bills already approved by @SenateDems :Immigrations, jobs bills,
@BarackObama Leadership is an even better choice. Give it a try.
@pk500 @BarackObama  why are u guys sooo cynical? Give hope a try it's really a better option!
@arulabee Hope is no replacement for smart policy executed with conviction. Hope is a slogan; leadership is a practice.
@pk500 yea ure right, but u need to give the guy a break!
@arulabee Why? He's had nearly six years. Trust me, the GOP is no better. But I had hope, and it's been become nothing more than a slogan.
@pk500 hmmmm can u do a better job than he has? Just askin
@arulabee Straw man argument. I'm not running for president and don't want job. But I vote and pay president's check, so I can have opinion.

You're going to need to project Harry Truman to get the job done. Make them accountable.
@BarackObama it's hard not to be cynical about promises from the nation of peace and freedom, who kills thousands of innocents with drones.
@BarackObama @donthebear Where is the hope? I used to have hope but misplaced somewhere around 2008, found it then lost again in 2012
@BarackObama My 4 year old son was wondering if you'd like to come to our house for food tomorrow? Gammon? We live near Cardiff airport! :)
@BarackObama @donthebear True point. Also cynicism 4 people who want excuse to do nothing &just complain about things instead of doing

@BarackObama given congress's current track record i think Cynicism is the perfect state of mind to have.
@BarackObama so sick of Congress. We the People want to be invited in to watch them behave foolishly. Then we'll know who to vote out.
@BarackObama Amen!

@BarackObama please you are a good man. Stop atrocities by Israel to Palestinian people. It is shameful
@BarackObama Speaking of cynical, Barry, how many beheadings of Americans constitute a  “manageable problem”? RESIGN, #Obama
@BarackObama Props! Well said and a thought I have had many times myself. Sad part is: Republican strategy is built on cynicism.

@BarackObama is there a federal law making being cynical a crime? You oughta make that a priority, don't you think?
@BarackObama And results are a helluva lot better than offering the fleeting illusion of hope, which is for the receiver to define.
@BarackObama Dear President Barack Obama! 
And I as before will make every effort of intellect and soul to win!Thank you! Victor!
