@BarackObama When minimum wage goes up, I will be forced to eliminate three jobs for every dollar of increase and I will not loose a dime.
@BarackObama That's probably not accurate - like everything else you have said has turned out.

@BarackObama We're all losing by looking at the small picture -- especially employers who fail to realize that their employees need $ to buy
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage The only thing holding back the increase is the GOP.
@BarackObama io penso mi scusa che lei è ignorante buonasera

@BarackObama the further extents of morality and sound doctrines gives me a right to not need a case number for a case,
@BarackObama and "What do the number on a court case number mean?" The first, fifth, and fourteenth amendments, including...
@BarackObama I believe that my answers certifications or rather say laws meaning what I Googled "What does a case number like?"...
@BarackObama Very true, true and the truth. Employers too, cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.

@BarackObama what employers what to raise minimum wage? Education, experience and skill is what qualifies a better paycheck.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama raising the minimum wage will ultimately put the lower class out. They will start to lose jobs and then be replaced by machines
@BarackObama thats great. Just don't campaign for Dems. Hurting bad thanks to your politics and platform.

@BarackObama hey resident Obama, you ever get tired of lying? sad when you believe your own lies
@BarackObama Support is also high for 20 cents a gallon of gas. Stop causing inflation. #endthefed
@BarackObama not mine. But I support it. Pretty fun trying to be a student, and work three jobs to pay bills.
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage small time employers can't afford to raise wages, is there a bracket who can raise or not raise? Get real.
@BarackObama

@BarackObama A mother 14 years didn't see her son, now son cold lay wait for their parents in New York to see him off, need help please
@BarackObama I'm a supporter
@BarackObama  raise wages and lower the cost of living!
@BarackObama Existing biz naturally favors barriers to competitor entry. Didn't you learn that working in the private sector? Oh, wait ...
@BarackObama they have no culture, only to see his son side, ask you to agree to visa come out to meet them
@BarackObama only employers whom can absorb the costs so they can use it to crush competition
@BarackObama Well... If support for a minimum wage increase is so strong, why are you so damned concerned about it?...
@BarackObama How about indexing it to inflation? Work for an hour, earn enough to pay for lunch. Now and forever.
@BarackObama So @BarackObama who lied to Bill @oreillyfactor you or Panetta about Benghazi ?
@labratones @BarackObama @oreillyfactor neither they were in agreement. http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/10/08/fox-news-deceptively-clips-obama-to-claim-panet/201067 …

Stop lying "@BarackObama: It's not just workers: According to a new survey, support is high among employers to #RaiseTheWage"
@I_Lay_Hoes @BarackObama heck no! If people don't want to get paid minimum wage they shouldn't have minimum skills.
@I_Lay_Hoes @BarackObama hahah nah bro you didn't go too far. Olympic gold medal winner Michael Phelps does it. So why not?
@BarackObama http://m.tmi.me/1eN07d 
@BarackObama save  Kobane
@BarackObama Y not train low paid workers 2 take skilled labor, such as plumbers, welders, Linemen, Electricians, & other trades?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Higher wages will lead to fewer entry level jobs because technology will replace them.  Reducing cost is the goal of employers.
@barackobama Le chômage est 2 fois moins élevé aux États-Unis qu'en France !
@BarackObama Sure, it will hurt new business and stifle competition, #unintendedconsequence
@BarackObama Why are you giving federal aid to PWI's that barely need it & none to HBCU's that have been under funded for decades?
