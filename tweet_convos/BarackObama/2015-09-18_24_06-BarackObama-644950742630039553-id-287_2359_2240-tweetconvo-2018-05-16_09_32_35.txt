@BarackObama...maybe its cause the sector's private & can't be seen in a public light of thought? Ever think of that? U know I have :-P #LOL
@BarackObama ..."I (or We) personally own it" vs. "it is publicly owned"...is the only tweek in thought needed...it though, exists in the...
@BarackObama ...public sector always...that is the nature of the market (it) and any legitimate business that operates within that market..!
@BarackObama ...no matter its size in nature; big or small...if it doesn't exist in the public sector contextually,,,regulating is ummmmm...
@BarackObama ...https://youtu.be/GtGNywkxw2U 
@BarackObama ...but SERIOUSLY...the market must be public in sect(O)ring...while the thought of ownership can be personal or public. Get me?
@BarackObama As a single parent I find this very scary. It must change. Keep up the good work. You are amazing!
