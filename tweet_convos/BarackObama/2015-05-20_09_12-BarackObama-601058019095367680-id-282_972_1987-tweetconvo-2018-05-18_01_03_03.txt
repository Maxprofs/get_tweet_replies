@BarackObama but you didnt sign the kyoto protocol?
@nabilahudatahar @BarackObama You mean Congress didn't, the President does not sign treaties, please read a book before talking with adults!
@trimblerob @BarackObama but he sure can order his ppl to sign it
@nabilahudatahar @BarackObama No again, Congress is an independent body, you must not be in the US, every 12 year old knows this!
@trimblerob yea Im not an American but then why only now after 18 yrs he brings this up?
@nabilahudatahar 18 years? He has been president for 6 years...he has mentioned Kyoto 488 times since 2007 using a simple twitter search.
@trimblerob well he better come up with something after the speech ends
@nabilahudatahar What do you do? I live in a solar powered home, drive an electric car, and grow my own foods. #globalcitizen
@BarackObama That's the same philosophy you clowns take toward the debt... Slow thew growth so we can cut the budget... Bullcrap.
@TFC3Tweets @BarackObama You need an economic class stat! #IdiotsParty

@trimblerob @BarackObama I don't watch Fox News. So stop assuming.
Stop putting out your hot air. MT @BarackObama The only way to prevent the effects of climate change is to slow the warming of the planet.
@ItsThatBriGuy @BarackObama Oh that is so cleaver. You are speaking to the leader of the free world with total disrespect. Raised in a barn?

@BarackObama yeah! We might as well protect the planet while you corrupt our minds!

@BarackObama  Global Warming Continues To Pummel Polar Ice Caps By Not Causing Them To Melt

@BarackObama Agreed!..Everyone's responsibility

I hope Obama is better at fighting mythical climate change than he is at fighting ISIS. @BarackObama @MissAli_Marie #tcot
@Al_Gorelioni @MissAli_Marie 
He's sending the Coast Guard to battle climate change. What a freakin moron.
@StevsWorld @MissAli_Marie Well said.  I'm picturing Don Quixote and the windmills.

@BarackObama
@BarackObama yes plus take CO2 out of the atmosphere. See my grant proposal submitted to 2015-NIST-SBIR-01, Saturn 5, Inc I know how to.
@BarackObama I suggest you talk to God about that since He is in complete control of His creation.
@BarackObama If you would stop talking it would help immensely!
@BarackObama @Jackthelad1947 Why did you approve the drilling in the Arctic? Actions not words Barack!
@BarackObama who is warming the Planet? 350 million americans with the a/c,billions of cars, barbeques for 4th of july,fireworks,etc,etc,etc

@BarackObama "Isn't it kind of odd that you're quoting yourself?" -- Citizen Omer M. Mozaffar
well we have millions of plans to do that. all options are on the table Mr. President @BarackObama
@BarackObama hello ?
@BarackObama  according to the GOP the climate change is only a mental state not a reality.ifweturnoff theirA/cmaybetheplanetwillbesaved
@BarackObama according to the GOP the climate change is only a mental state, nothing to do with reality.
@barackobama   We're on your side Mr. President.  The haters are an embarrassment.
@BarackObama  motherfucker's hell speech
@BarackObama So what will you do to slow down the warming of the palnet?
@BarackObama let me be clear if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor
@BarackObama the inner core and magnetosphere control the climate, All it asks man is to clean up after yourself before you leave.
Obama fighting climate change is like Don Quixote's epic battle against the windmills. @BarackObama @MissAli_Marie @ @BunnysDaughter
Except Don Quixote was noble and actually had a better chance of being the victor. @Al_Gorelioni @BarackObama @MissAli_Marie
@BarackObama ....never to prevent it. From god own creations..
@FaikGurel ...I want all of you, yeah!
@BarackObama @OsmanAkkoca ''For this job before everything;bigwigs,governments & ignorant people must put their cotton hands under stone.''
@BarackObama And the only way that is going to happen is if we stop burning fossil fuels, stop fracking, stop tar sands.
@BarackObama well its taken you long enough to twig to something the rest of us have known for years. Typical American come in at the end.
@BarackObama welcome
@BarackObama
@BarackObama 
The only thing warming is my distrust of You!
@BarackObama Signing and implementing the Kyoto protocol would be a good start. We did that in Europe in 2002, so we are way ahead of you!
@BarackObama @aplsmith5 maybe if you stopped as many drones and f16-jets flying around it might help aswell.
@BarackObama @aplsmith5 Oh goodness why didn't anyone else think of that ; )
@MillieLasne I guess Congress may not have worked that out yet, Alison? God bless, Andy
@BarackObama @paulinewes
“@BarackObama: "The only way the world is going to prevent
@BarackObama Great job you are doing Mr President. I know you have a tough job and many of us are behind you. 
@BarackObama The Barack-ness monster has spoken. haha
@BarackObama you are great sir. we need more proactive actions to prevent the catastrphies
@BarackObama we have alot of problems in our back yard before we take on the false narrative of global warming.
@barackobama 
I think more cities should use recycling and seperation at their expense. This saves money, and prevent waste. Which can help
.@BarackObama so to stop global warming we must stop global warming? Got it.
@garret_fisler @BarackObama lmfao
@BarackObama How do we slow down/prevent the warming of the planet?
@BarackObama president obama what is the optimum operating temperature for earth?
@BarackObama what a lie
@BarackObama Thts absolutely tru MR President. The ? Is who will listen when u speak leaders of other countries act deaf.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama think you need convince ISIS to get tough on climate.
@BarackObama followed :) maybe fb?
@BarackObama @billpostmus OK, how about you help by stop talking...your hot air is killing us all.
@BarackObama If slowing down the warming of the planet is a climate change requirement it would help if you quit expelling the hot air spee
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @billpostmus maybe this May 20th snow day in UP Michigan and in Colorado will help?!
@BarackObama señor Obama espero y deseo que lleguemos  a tiempo para parar este desastre que nosotros mismos creamos gracias
@BarackObama @billpostmus Well yes, but let's be very careful not to sail right off the edge of the world too. #PrezOisanIdiot
@BarackObama @billpostmus Pipe down Erkel.  That's a good start.  Stop warming the planet with your hot air.
@BarackObama @billpostmus If @POTUS thinks he can change the way earth orbits the sun, perhaps we should send him into space to fix it.
@BarackObama @billpostmus wow, that's "genius" mr pres 0_o
@BarackObama With all do respect sir, why are you allowing Arctic drilling if you are so worried about the environment.
@BarackObama Easier said than done
@BarackObama @BarackObama afforestation is the better way for this.But it seems that no one is interested in it.
@BarackObama You are a lair. You are trying to poison us.
@BarackObama @ the worlds governments best stop testing nukes all over the world then hey Barack? 2500 nukes set off world wide since 1940s.
@BarackObama yes ! U r right if we are not take any remedy measures,the world will create  another oceans. Call for Global leaders meeting.

@BarackObama hi sir ji how are you
@BarackObama
Don't be shy, @BarackObama you have to help push fossil interests from the market, renewables, #windfarms are cheap @DucovanDijk
@barackobama give preference to ecology over economy to do that
@BarackObama You should be the one to turn off your A.C..
@BarackObama а что же ты тогда войны везде развязываешь,на Украине,а теперь и в Македонии,болтун...!!!???)))
@BarackObama Nice words sir, but maybe is too late for that, and sure it is quite complicated to do. Anyway, lets do our best to try it.
@BarackObama The planet is fine. It's been doing this long before man existed. #WakeUpAmerica #ObamaLies
@BarackObama has there ever been aby doubt that the world is becoming warmer.
@BarackObama so will y'all be turning off the heaters in the White House?
@BarackObama  another hurdle is getting certain people to believe it actually exists and will continue to get worse. #saveourplanet
@BarackObama
@BarackObama usa and china is mainly responsible of climate change.
@BarackObama , / There's no way we can stop mother nett, stop the flow of smoking.
@BarackObama We expect the USA to lead by example.
@BarackObama LOL  You mean there's NO defense against Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall?  This is KGB created farce to deindustrialize West
@BarackObama :)
@BarackObama make all new cars hydrogen or electric and eat less beef because they fart methane.
@BarackObama: Is climate change real? Yes. R humans contributing to global warming? Yes. R humans major cause of global change? Not clear.
@BarackObama please contact @TonyAbbottMHR he is a climate change denier and needs lessons in good governance.
@BarackObama news flash, weather is cyclic. Always has been, always will be. You can't control it. Quit spending my tax dollars on it.
@BarackObama I actually support global warming = more bikinis #FirstDude #Viagreatness
@BarackObama 
The only way the world is going to prevent the effects of climate change is to stop war worldwide (bombs & families)
@BarackObama #educate #america #medicalcannabis #MedicalMarijuana
@BarackObama cierto Presidente¡¡¡
@BarackObama or put money toward climate engineering
@BarackObama please kill the F35 and use the savings to make more A10, F22, and invest in Amtrak
@BarackObama that is a profound statement. Like "The only way we are going to make ice is to freeze water."
@BarackObama START WITH UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
@BarackObama Without any help from us beyond our propensity to generate heat any time we do anything.
@BarackObama have you seen the oil on the California coast?
@BarackObama To late, the climate train has left the station the south west is proof positive so build a pipeline network of water sharing.
@BarackObama Aww boss. The #Unpossess(ed) #GodBlessed #Eagle  likes you! Had to feed it, #Brontosaurus & #snake 's.
@BarackObama :)
@BarackObama how do you plan to do it
@BarackObama Is it possible the Earth is still warming from that last cooling episode and we are moving back to warm shallow seas?
@BarackObama  Climate change. Long cycles. Where did the ice go from the last ice age of 15-20 thousands years ago?
@BarackObama We should start manufacturing snow machines then it can snow 24 7. That should do it
@BarackObama Go to the stars
@BarackObama already experiencing the effects of #climatechange. Prevention no longer an option, mitigation needed to avoid catastrophe.
@BarackObama so why don't you protect the Arctic from offshore oil drilling and reject Shell's 2015 Exploration Plan?
@SalgueroAgus @Cris_telefe
@BarackObama ,, ... Many Workplaces in the Counties ? 
@BarackObama ,, ... Some times ago I had a idea with Snake Leather Clothing ? Options in Florida, new Mexico and Texas ? ........
@BarackObama ,, I meant Snake Farms ? Private so even county own Snake Farms ? Snakes feed production, Leather production and so on ? 
@BarackObama si ...y como se frena eso? si cada dia hacemos lo contrario?
@BarackObama ,, I think, build european Pick up and Car principle ? County based Food production, Supply and storage ? And by the way ......
@BarackObama we support u to reduce it's impact by floating it as the international emergency issue...
@BarackObama Globalization is the main cause because this globalization closer the nation and promote industrialization.........
@BarackObama pls let the @POTUS  talk,  quoting yourself on your 'own' handle is a bit funny.
@BarackObama stopping consumption. Producing less. We can do it.
@BarackObama Don't forget to stop those who benefit most from all this: Nestle and Monsanto. One has the water, the other the seeds.
@BarackObama The only way to prevent the effects of climate change is to be the Commander in Chief of ISIS & drop bombs on every country.
@BarackObama Wow, what intelligence!!!!
@BarackObama farmers and those with large properties w/o trees are the most responsible.
@BarackObama raise my taxes based on biased science.. no thanks.
@BarackObama Great. So why then is the White House powered by coal? And don't tell me it's clean coal...that fantasy doesn't suit you.
@BarackObama See The Thing Is "Everyone Wants A Change, But No One Wants To Change"..
@BarackObama please. There are bigger problems.
@BarackObama And so, what about your authorization for Shell to do the business in Artic ???
@BarackObama Every day we are using equipment exothermic, we need to develop gadgets which absorb heat to work # endothermic sctist to work
