@amirhimself @BarackObama hi dear
@BarackObama
@BarackObama By raising wages you will be forcing companies to raise cost thus forcing millions out of work.
@BarackObama Yes, make an executive decision.
@BarackObama Yes, Barack. Why not start with your own third world First Nations reservations? You owe them big time.
@BarackObama yes Sir I agree
@BarackObama a full time job is below poverty and these days if you're not making 50g a year you are pretty poor
@BarackObama
@BarackObama The problem is, almost no one works full time nowadays. Why? Employers would have to give them ObamaCARE. You are at fault Pres

@BarackObama The answer isn't raising wages; stop taxing the people. Stop wasting $ building trails to nowhere-stop the spending
@BarackObama Here's the problem-U don't raise the poverty line when the cost of living goes up. There are more people in poverty than U know
@BarackObama nice theme and thinking

@BarackObama Agree, but the middle class can't keep being penalized for their hard work, either. Remember that when planning for this.
@BarackObama all jobs should pay a prevailing wage
