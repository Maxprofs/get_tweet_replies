@error9900 LOL! Yeah, I totally trust something that Chris Hayes thinks is wonderful.  @WhiteHouse
@laurakfillault @WhiteHouse Ad hominem. Where do you see Hayes there anyway? Why not rebut the stats/study if you think it's wrong, instead?
@error9900 Honey, unlike you, I actually try to research what I post. I'm not wasting my time rebutting a book that I care nothing about.
@laurakfillault Not the book; I'm asking you to rebut the article that specifically addresses your concerns about inflation from min wage.
@WhiteHouse Food, housing and health are global priorities. Without this there will be no government but misrule.
