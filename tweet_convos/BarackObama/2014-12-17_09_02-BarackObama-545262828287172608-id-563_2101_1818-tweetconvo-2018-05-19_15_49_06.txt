@aaarocket37 No. It is @BarackObama normalizing relations with Cuba. No conspiracies necessary.
@aaarocket37 Do you have any evidence for this? I think you don't like Obama, so you believe anything negative you are told about him.
@aaarocket37 I already researched this back in 2008. There is nothing to any of these assertions. They are wrong on multiple levels.
@aaarocket37 I know that is wrong. There is no evidence he attended that church regularly. He didn't 'pal around' with Bill Ayers either.
@BarackObama Good!!!!!! Let those that want to stay in 1960 howl!!! Moving forward in 2014!
@GROIDS2235 @BarackObama water boarding bad. Doing business with a murderous dictator, good.? #tcot #tlot #ccot

@GROIDS2235 @BarackObama Obama rewarding criminal regimes for taking Americans hostage is nothing to celebrate..
@j_s45 @BarackObama Go tell that to China. Drop all ties to that country. I bet Rubio says no. Hypocrisy
@GROIDS2235 two wrongs don't make a right.? But, in your feeble attempt at obfuscation, i can see why you vote Obama
@j_s45 Yep, my opinion without the name calling.
@GROIDS2235 name calling.? Did I hurt your matronly sensibilities? Sad for you it won't get through congress.
