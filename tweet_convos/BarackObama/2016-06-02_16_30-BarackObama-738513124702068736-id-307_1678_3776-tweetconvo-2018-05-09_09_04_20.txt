U talk all this crap, but haven't lifted 1 finger 2 help. Shame on u as the potus. U R a disgrace 2 the AMERICAN People
@BarackObama
99% of gun deaths are in your Chicago where guns are banned. Gun laws don't stop gun violence it raises them against innocent
@Everytown And so am I! Expect greatness. Never was the chain broken. Great!
@Everytown 75m followers and only 1500 rt's... "Congress must do something".. Don't ask the community to do anyting though.
@Everytown
@stephsoechtig should be wearing orange for breaking state and federal gun laws.#wearorange #whatajoke #guncontrol
@BarackObama
Without my gun, how will I ever defend myself against Clinton protesters?  TRUMP 2016!
Mr. Obama, if you completely  close GuntanamaBay and release all political  détainees, you will be a legend.
YOU couldn't stop the gun violence in the most fun violent city in the USA!  Stop the criminals and terrorists not citizens!
ciao!!!
My neighbor just stabbed to death - she doesn't matter? "@BarackObama: why people across country #WearOrange today. https://amp.twimg.com/v/43b27caf-3516-43d6-9a0e-93c956048e13 …”
With luck both Hillary and Obama will be wearing Orange for a very long time.
It Takes BALLS to do what we are doing. , https://igg.me/at/EasyColorExpress …, http://easycolorexpress.com 
@Everytown How are you trying to humiliate the man does not get a sense of squestion of whether to help Iraq to the face of God
I'm all for reducing gun violence, but did everyone fail to realize prison inmates wear orange too?
#priorWHCA
@Everytown Obama continues to believe gun control like Chicago has fixes gun violence! lol
ORANGE, YOU ARE AN IDIOT!
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. LET'S ALL LOOK LIKE PRISONERS!

Please help Mich! We've worked hard to legalize mj, but Snyder et al. are trying to thwart our efforts. 
@MI_Legalize2016
A single incident in 2940000 people is not a high level and the Gun didn't do it
great job leading us thus far I think in the future people will regret that you where not able to lead us in a third term.
@Everytown askim obisim
This is such a distraction! In a country of 320+ Million ppl, only 38K jobs created in May!! Our economy is SUPER WEAK!!
@TheKingCenter I am certainly against gun violence, but a # campaign means nothing, also, prisoners wear orange....
@Everytown i would love to see a bunch of the government where the orange jumpsuit
@Everytown  :Kudos to everyone who stands up, speaks loudly in unity for an end to gun violence.#WearOrange
@Everytown
@Everytown
The day you're replaced by a real president, we should all wear diarrhea colored shirts in celebration of your end.
why don't you just wear Redcoat Red in honor of the British and how you want to shred the Constitution.

come on Mr president. Let's get on the campaign circuit!
Nation's first woman coal miner Diana Baldwin died in E. Ky this week. Deserves some attention.
This is why you should never have been anything more than a community organizer
@Everytown how do we end violence?
Why aren't Bernie and Clinton condemning these anti Trump agitators?? Where's Obama? Where are the anti violence groups?
GUNALARMS in ALLUSASchools Name SHIELDS Alarm Harvard Daddy Before u Leave Office
