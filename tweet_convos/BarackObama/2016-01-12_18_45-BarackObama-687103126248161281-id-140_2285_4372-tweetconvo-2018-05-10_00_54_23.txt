@BarackObama @sapiosanct I still remember people thinking the world was going to end when it hit $1 per gallon. LOL!
@BarackObama @sapiosanct I think that was about 1980 or so.... over 3 decades ago.
And yet, of course some people blamed @BarackObama for "rising gas prices" as if he had started it. LOL!  @sapiosanct
Here... http://www.randomuseless.info/gasprice/gasprice.html … ...is a page with some nice graphs, showing US gasoline prices from 1979 to 2016. @BarackObama @sapiosanct
Notice what the graph does in 2008? Hey @BarackObama that must be what the conservatives werer holding against you, huh? LOL! @sapiosanct
@BarackObama I'm a supporter, but $2 gas cost my job at an integrated oil company. Remember it isn't all good for everyone. #SOTU
@BarackObama Today in IL I just paid $1.64/gal. Heard there is a station in MI at 47c! Last time I saw that...oh wait, I've never seen that.
@BarackObama Only in America and it is still not good enough. Some Europeans pay $5.00. Who says your economy is dismal? The other side sad
@BarackObama it nice ..keep it up..thanks
@BarackObama @ZJPrince7 spent 2.25 a gallon in Miami last weekend.
@Phrat_Joe @BarackObama At least Orlando has gas for $1.90 haha
@BarackObama  Awesome!!!
@BarackObama cheers
@BarackObama great and watch the market crash.
@BarackObama i dont have a car but it was much higher in  2008
@BarackObama except for the fact that thousand of oilfield jobs were lost
@BarackObama What about lowest labor participation rate in 4 decades? Pay 27% below inflation adjusted trend from when u took office? #Truth
@BarackObama you're right about that! I remember not being able to afford to fill up but thanks to you! I appreciate you, Mr. PRESIDENT!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @keithsemple ....credit where credit is due...agreed....mortgage help too..good job and help...
@BarackObama @America24News @POTUS "AIN'T" that common core education? Sounds VERY PRESIDENTIAL

@BarackObama @keithsemple come to CA.....it's not under 2$ a gallon.
@BarackObama Take credit for market forces beyond your control. THANK GOD FOR CAPITALISM
@BarackObama except YOU had nothing to do with that. I remember the papers saying it was because American oil companies stood their ground.
@BarackObama that because ISIS is flooding the market moron.
@BarackObama Kiosks replacing jobs to pay 15 an hour isn't so bad either..... but let's not talk about the decrease in employment opps.
@BarackObama Thank you POTUS!
@BarackObama @olgacollette Ain't bad at all BO!!!
@BarackObama I have mixed feelings about this one since I get royalties but still like cheap gas
I cordially invite @BarackObama to the OCEAN TUNNELS group to make it 10 cents a gallon.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/1548937018758434/ …
@BarackObama good thing your salary is guaranteed. I'm glad. Because ours ain't. I aint guaranteed for tomorrow.
