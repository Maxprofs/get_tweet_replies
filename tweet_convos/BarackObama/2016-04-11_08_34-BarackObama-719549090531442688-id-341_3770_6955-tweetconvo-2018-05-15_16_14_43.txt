@BarackObama I would hope so president
You must be wishing you followed Canadas ways with Universal HealthCare before it became a dash for cash. Good Luck.
Some, but Reaganomics was our biggest blunder, at least until the Iraq War.
Taxing insane salaries heavily worked.
It's really the parasites at the top, skimming profits, who bleed the life out of the economy.
Civilization needs an alignment to cull disease every so often and 
the democrats have expedited the need.
 Go #TRUMP
Time for World War III to go nuclear, you say?
You know Trump's eager to use nukes, right?
@BarackObama @sophiasw4love I agree. It is sad to think most Americans have to decide which is more important...health or home

@BarackObama health insurance should pay for all medical expenses.  Why should people forego health care, because of cost?
@BarackObama going to a teaching job sick only spreads that illness to the children. Reading to 100 students with pneumonia causes epidemics

@BarackObama no one should have to be forced by government to have health care. I think that is called fascism
@BarackObama
