“@BarackObama: It's time to make the pay gap a thing of the past—American women deserve better. #WEMatter”
@BarackObama Women are barely starting to get truly recognized for all of their accomplishments!  Women are multi-taskers & risk takers!
@BarackObama In fact in some jobs like Personal or Private Secretary, Personal Assistant etc, women are preferred to men.
