@BarackObama @alishanoellee psst this has been disproven
@BarackObama ....aren't you the president...you know, the guy who can fix this?!
@JoeandtheJungle @BarackObama u might want to remember our less than friendly neighborhood congress
@TRW200 @BarackObama Still, I think an executive order banning unfair wages for women would be pretty widely accepted
@JoeandtheJungle @BarackObama I agree 100% issue is employers will ignore it.we've got 2 get people 2 stop devaluing based on sex and color

@BarackObama How does your office look like on the equal pay thing?
@EyeDesertBlog @BarackObama government jobs have not been excluded although they do tend to pay better than private industries
@TRW200 I meant what @BarackObama's staff gets. Not the govt. itself.
@EyeDesertBlog still paid according to grade levels so unequal pay is still possible just like with any other admin.
@TRW200 but wouldn't it be possible to pay them over? Or what their ability to work deserves?
@EyeDesertBlog anything is possible the ? Is what is more likely to happen vs what could possibly happen

@BarackObama yes, women deserve equal pay
@BarackObama @Jenna_m_Lind And the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963, by a 362-9 vote. All 9 "no" votes were democrats.
@BarackObama @Jenna_m_Lind Actually, it's 93 cents on the dollar, and the discrepancy can be accounted for by men working longer hours.
@BarackObama @marieclaire All #OBamas must leave now. Quit meandering @flotus @potus @EUombudsman @EU_Commission  I'm taking over. #ceo

@BarackObama @SerenaZill
@BarackObama this cartoon has the potential  to misguide. Do women earn less in the same job?
@BarackObama @barbls23 VERY ONE DESERVES EQUAL PAY AND FAIR WAGES.EXCEPT 4 THE GOP DOING NOTHING CONGRESS

@BarackObama @Marinenburg Why only woman? ;) shouldn't it be "Retweet if you agree that men and woman deserve equal pay for equal work"?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama yes I do believe that women should have equal pay for equal work . If they can do equal work.
@BarackObama I say equality if the person delivers the same results, regardless of sex, race or religion.

@BarackObama my wife makes less money than I do but she's still the boss. A boss shouldn't make less. Your comment appears to be accurate.
@BarackObama I am all for equal pay but how about maternity leave with full pay for 3 months?

@BarackObama @halinareijn Mijn moeder werkte (al) in 1955. En had het toen al over "equal pay". Nog weinig veranderd.

@BarackObama dear Pdt, the cause is good. But here in France the 1st & only problem is... just to have a job. Men & women together.
