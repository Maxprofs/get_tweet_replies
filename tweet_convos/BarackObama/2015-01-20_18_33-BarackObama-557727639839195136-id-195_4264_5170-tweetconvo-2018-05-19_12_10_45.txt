@BarackObama @erinsorensen by equal pay you mean .. Those that work get the same amount as those that don't?? Sounds like COMMUNISM TO ME
@vvBrianLax @BarackObama @erinsorensen wow. Are you serious??  I can't tell?
@SarahPMacD @erinsorensen every job I have had paid based on position never a difference between man woman.  Grocery bagger, U.S. Navy, FAA
@vvBrianLax @erinsorensen and that's good for you - as a white male - but I'm sure it's not fair for everyone.  You can't ignore facts.
@SarahPMacD @erinsorensen again like I said I have to admit my work history never had a difference between man woman black white red green
@vvBrianLax @erinsorensen I'm still not sure why it's communism to want equal pay. Glad u got lucky at your jobs but don't be blind to fact.
@SarahPMacD @erinsorensen I have been blessed in life served my Country and have worked my ass off Life's not easy n free rides bother me
@vvBrianLax @erinsorensen I don't think you understand equal pay buddy.  It's not charity or a handout.
