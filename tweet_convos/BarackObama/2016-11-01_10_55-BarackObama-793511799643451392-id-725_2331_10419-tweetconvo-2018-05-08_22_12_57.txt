How many Congressmen and Presidents are under Obamacare?   When they are covered, we can discuss Obamacare.  Till then, keep it out of USA.
So what youth don't like truth
As nation of ur maning faces indstruter for the next generation
So what's wrong with socialism? Do you even know what it is?
Being British and having free health care, I am struggling to understand why so many Americans are against Obamacare.
Me too.
I No love your Barack Obama


looking forward to your departure.  Worst 8 years this country had to endure!!!!  Will you and your family be on Obamacare!!!
I wouldn't Say worst... There has been some good in it...Congress has been shit though
Congress has done a HELL Of a job holding this man back from totally destroying us!
Lets hope they can hold Trump Back from destroying us aswell
Trump has no desire to destroy us like Obama did .He wants to HELP us
Obama didnt really destroy us.. And Trump is too dumb to help us..
In case you haven't notice Trump is anything but Dumb. Obama tried his best to destroy us.
okay we will see.. I hope the best for the Man but i dont believe he can accomplish anything!
AND YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DOCTORS!
@BarackObama can you please start calling ACA "#TrumpCare"? Feed his ego to save millions of lives. Or #WhiteCare or #RichPeopleCare...
LIES!!  I'm a cancer survivor & losing my insurance!!  Too high!!  A joke!!  Shame on you!!  I had good insurance until you!!
Why dont you still have that good insurance?
Cannot afford it.  Went from 500 to 900 w/Obama!
this year?
it sounded like you had better insurance before ACA
Bonjour
Orange Cosby wants to take this protection away from every American. Let that sink in.
When a law is a disaster you do away with it. Common sense is not that common among liberals
both sides have good ideas about health care, why can't they work together to give people the best care?
1 Dems didn't want Repub input. 
We have the most partisan divisive admin
I missed the point of the tweet,  recap?
The law is a disaster. It will fold under its own weight. 2017 it goes away.
Butamu good
Unfortunately it's 2 expensive 2 afford. Many people don't have insurance bec. its 2 damn expensive.

Are preexisting conditions covered if you cannot afford to pay the insurance for the doctor you don't like.
are you kidding me? That insurance you shoved down my throat didn't settle too well.  798.00 is not affordable!!
Hi Obama , Will you help to spread the word ?

How about the employment line? That will resolve several of their problems.
So all poor whites work no mater their age?

The deductible was so high I had to pay for my adult daughter's medication or she would have died. Maybe 2.0= better.
my Medicaid plus sucks
Obama know anything about insurance ? Doesn't work. Insurers don't cover these costs of pre conditions. People will pay costs!

This is the best care on this planet. Worth the investment.

can Trump repeal it? Will he? His administration scares me
Since #Obamacare, my health insurance costs have almost doubled & my deductibles have greatly increased. Painful. Not good.
Thank you for postively affecting the social determinants of health for millions #Healthcare #nurses @WHO @OFA @MichelleObama
No Obama care I don't have because I get to much money from my dad who died from Cancer.
hay man how do you do? Hope to be fine and healthy.
This development in this regard was purely HUMANITARIAN ! Salute
and I get to pay 2600 TIMES more annually for my HC..but illegals are covered.. Thanks Obama
one big government run insurance pot that covers everyone for all but the most expensive treatments. Simple.

oh so I'm paying for those who can't. Nice thank you I can no longer afford insurance
just make sure your coverage is above the $6,000 deduct 600 monthly no money to see a regular physician emergency care
now I just lay in bed on ice packs..no life..thanks Obama
and thanks to you... Ppl with chronic pain can't get pain pills to help with the pain...doctors are afraid of the DEA now....
clown leader as long as you can float the deductibles and premiums deductible 20,000 premium 800 per month  Gruber
but watch out for the out of pocket 12000
an employee at United Healthcare told me you ruined health care. I can no longer receive the help I need. I have to start over
@MichelleObama dearest President&awesome 1st LADY! Could u plz spend a few minutes on the phone with cancer person? Beg'n 4 mom
wish it ws entirely true Bt, my mom who raises her g'son is denied lots because/few $ she gets from child support. & has cancer
My nephew has hemophilia. I fear for his life if pre existing conditions and lifetime caps return.
your Healthcare is NOT AFFORDABLE!!!!! We the people don't matter to you. Your having a negative impact on our country
Is your ego so big you really think you did something right for the American people by starting Obamacare?  of course attaching your name!
Your pre-existing condition is as a Liar, an Islamo Fascist & a black power racist. Good bye scum bag.
credit where credit is due, two things that were good, pre-existing conditions, your child can stay on it till 26
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
you just like that shit cause if your name
ACA HELPED 20 MIL PPL? What about the ones that lost their homes because their costs are more than their mortgage? Single PPL!
you are going down the worst  
Embarrassment to the American people
the new healthcare will be much better, stop pushing something that failed.
yeah right. If you afford the 139% increase in premiums
LOL!  The UNAFFORADABLE CARE ACT must and WILL BE REPEALED once common sense is returned to the White House!! MAGA

they just can't afford the premiums or deductible/copay.  i'm sure you want the middle class to pay for that too.

the Republicans wanted pre-existing conditions offered as well, that's not original.

Unaffordable and a lie.

msenge wewe
can someone explain please?
I say free all tax payers in the UK pay towards the NHS via a small deduction from our wages. But it is worth it.
the next us president will continue with Obamacare, trump will not certainly take oath as next us president. keep in mind.
you should ask other leaders globally to have their own Obamacare.
OH HOW YOU LIE! MY SAVINGS ARE GONE. MY RETIREMENT IS GONE because of your PREMIUMS! Thanks so much jerk!
Un hombre de buena voluntad
@BarackObama
no sir now all we focus on is how in the HELL am I going to be able to pay 750.00 a month! at age 56!
not outside the beltway - in NWPA -- people with Cancer are being DROPPED or co-pays cannot be afforded so have no insurance
Sure you can get treatment, if you can AFFORD IT! Out of pocket is HIGH, then they don't pay for all of it, prices soared! FAIL
