@BarackObama and have spent less money helping the economy
@Rogertellem ask the rich backed GOP why they refuse to help the middle class
@justgivemesun haha.  We can ask all the questions we want but the reality of it is, is that this farthest from a democracy this country
@Rogertellem answer why?
@justgivemesun well I'll tell you this.   Money money money....when you pay for someone to get elected they in turn take care of you.
@Rogertellem a crisis that has to be stopped. Citizens united has to b overturned. But obvious which party is in big money's pocket -GOP
@BarackObama 6 million already had medicare.. another 1 million are illegals. You blew us all up to cover 3 million? Not impressed.
@goptraci @BarackObama 3 MILLION more is pretty f*g good
@justgivemesun @BarackObama The population in the USA is 317,000,000.  I don't think LESS than 1% of the entire population is worth it.
@goptraci all I had to read was conservative, "patriot" "Christian" and NRA and I know you aren't seeing the big picture
LMAO I see it "@justgivemesun all I had to read was conservative, "patriot" "Christian" and NRA and I know you aren't seeing the big picture
@BarackObama Too bad #UPMC  is a monopoly in Pittsburgh. Their selfishness has hampered my health and limited my care.
@BarackObama thanks for my insurance , now let's beat cancer. I'm fighting everyday with ur help. #Wecandoit #ThanksObama #SOTU
@BarackObama @chloeforsale With the unaffordable deductible.  Which makes it useless
@AshtenMartin @BarackObama it helped me. it's absolutely not useless.
@chloeforsale @BarackObama 9/10 people I know in my family that have enrolled in ObamaCare simply can't afford going with the coats...tbc
@AshtenMartin but it's income based.
@chloeforsale exactly.  But if the goal is to make universal healthcare, we should try and make it affordable.  That's my opinion.
@AshtenMartin it is affordable, im telling you.
@chloeforsale I'm not trying to make arguments though.  Just an opinion
@AshtenMartin I agree but I'm just saying, nothing's perfect.
@BarackObama Um no..because coverage ended end of year for many! Most hve to reapply.
@BarackObama love it
@BarackObama ola. Obama
@BarackObama fuck health coverage fucks up do I get a rebate if I never use the shit fuckin crooks make me get some shit I barely use
@BarackObama minorities and blacks have gotten free insurance coverage thanks to me and my fellow working white men.
@BarackObama why do you lie so often?
@BarackObama @comradop  Good economic policies because I paid $1.65 for a gallon of gas today. I use to pay $3.45 per gallon.
@BarackObama @comradop awesome speech. Africa is in a deeper trouble now, since there will not be much help coming from America.
@BarackObama Well done Mr President, well done
@BarackObama Hard working Americans need to get the coverage we deserve. Great job!

@BarackObama I had a heart attack last year, But thanks to OBAMA CARE, I had  health coverage. I didn't have worry about how to pay the bill
@BarackObama it sure sounds good but it didn't help me, my premiums went even higher!
@BarackObama Health Coverage should be a right with all the red tape.
@BarackObama and mine doubled this year with a 12,000.00 deductible. I can't afford to use something I have to pay for.  Only used once 2014
@BarackObama what happened to the other 30m, how many lost coverage?
@BarackObama In Cuba everybody can visit doctors. For 50 years already. In poor country. With US economic blockade for 50 years.
@BarackObama and millions had their insurance canceled, or their current policies became to expensive.
@BarackObama it would be a lot higher if we had Medicare for all #SOTU
@BarackObama yeah and you commie cocksuckers put the rest of us in the poor house. You socialist /commie/liberal phoney golf playing dickhed
