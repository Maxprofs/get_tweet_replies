@BarackObama the reality . ..inspire, touch n moved.
@BarackObama the playing field is NOT level. We're importing far more than we export, putting too many American dollars in foreign pockets.
@BarackObama What about Vietnam?
@BarackObama yeah cause the USA spends so much on our military fighting oversea wars costing trillions of dollars and getting nowhere
@BarackObama The greatest leaders sometimes never get to fulfill what that began MLK social excellence social endeavors, a planter of seeds
@BarackObama So you are arguing for US workers to earn $0.06 an hour like Vietnamese? Or as slave labor on Indonesian fishing boats?
@BarackObama Congratulations!
@BarackObama is asking for a level field and for the USA to write the rules of trade... What a joke!
@BarackObama maybe . . .

@BarackObama That's racist !
@BarackObama except in the areas of  world #sports, #education, and people (general and powerful) who believe in #evolution.

@BarackObama Of course that's not true!
@BarackObama yes, except for soccer.  Oh, and scholastic performance...   but other than that...
