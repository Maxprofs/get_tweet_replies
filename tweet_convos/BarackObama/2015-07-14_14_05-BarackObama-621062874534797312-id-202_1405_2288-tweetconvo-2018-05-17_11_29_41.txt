Excellent quote? Can we hope Indian Govt will take a lesson from this and start this practice at least for senior citizen?
@BarackObama Listen to TE KETTLE - GOD I NEED YOU IN MY LIFE by Edward Anderson 5 #np on #SoundCloud
@BarackObama Insurance just increasing costs & reducing benefits to continue to max profits - Not the intent of ACA surely? #CannotGetMyMeds

@BarackObama thank you you have no idea how health care has helped me out tremendously this year
@BarackObama ;)))
@BarackObama This was rammed through by just Democrats with bullying and pay offs. Thats not democracy.
“@BarackObama: "Health care is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all of us." —President Obama” TELL TEXAS.

“@BarackObama: "Health care is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all of us." —President Obama”
@BarackObama of course, that's the least the government could do for the people, like Canada. Health care should be free everywhere.
@BarackObama very truly said Sir
@BarackObama you rock!!!
@BarackObama  Move to Canada, we have it pretty good! ;)
@BarackObama @ReeseClarett13 but my insurance should not cost more so someone else gets it for free.

@BarackObama #AsshatInChief #ACA #Grubered #Pelosied You've increased my premium, copay & deductible. Politicians shouldn't be exempt.
