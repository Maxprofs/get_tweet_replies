@kerrywashington @POTUS Amen
@msavonlady2 How are you Sister?
Hi Sister I dont go on twitter like I do facebook :-)
@kerrywashington @POTUS I'm grateful too. It's crazy to think the measures for medicine aren't taken for gun control
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS 看不懂
@kerrywashington @POTUS Oh poor you, what about the people that need to defend themselves against criminals? #StopTyrannyNow!
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS   LOVE my POTUS. Smarter than all the rest!
@LuvGardea @kerrywashington @POTUS you really can't be this stupid??The only people being made safer are criminals..they don't obey the law
@pc_sux @kerrywashington @POTUS you're redundant!  @pc_sux
@kjediting @POTUS 
He is doing nothing but blowing smoke up your but. Try disarming the criminals not the citizens!
think of this way in life u need a lic 4 most things, something that could kill u shouldn't? I'm lost.
@kerrywashington @mcspocky @POTUS now please focus on our misguided youth gang epidemic created by prison system. Let's work on all violence
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Yes, U all work on reducing - Most gang related R better off buried than me paying 4 their time in jail
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS those numbers don't compare to medical malpractice or car crashes. 21,000 were suicide
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS So true, Kerry.
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS fyd
@kerrywashington @POTUS guns don't kill people. People kill people. Obama just made it easier for the criminals. I pray for all America
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Empty feel good measures that will do nothing. Death rate due to guns has been declining for years.
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS DON'T INVEST EARN INSTANT WITH BARACK OBAMA  http://TheReferProject.com/index.php?ref=129050 …

@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS What is the source of the 30,000 number?
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS ok every day over 1,500 ppl die from cardiovascular disease so let's give people real food #priorities
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Check out  http://youtu.be/bbZ7wybGa_8?a    via @YouTube for more info
@kerrywashington @POTUS Yes, Yes, Yes! Thank you for doing SOMETHING to stop #gunviolence
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS  BS. Where was he in 2010-2011 when he CONTROLLED all?
@kerrywashington @POTUS is not going to  make us safer
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Nope!
@kerrywashington @I hope peace to all of the world
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS yes most in Dem cities
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Will your security guards still use guns?
@kerrywashington read #2. That's how they will pull together the ills. Oh and by the way only ill. Crazy isn't ill
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Barack Hussein Obama is not Fitzgerald Grant
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS he is reality and a poor excuse for a president at that
@kerrywashington @POTUS me leaving the world by gunfire then that would be great. I imagine going peacefully in my bed.
@kerrywashington @POTUS I don't understand why something like this would be met by negative comments. If he can reduce the chance of  (pt1)
@kerrywashington @POTUS
@kerrywashington @BarackObama Like the 1994 assault weapons ban made the victims at Columbine High School safer? Don't buy it America.
@kerrywashington @POTUS #NRA #TeaParty Puppet BS Rhetoric vs What THEY Do #Navy #Marines #Veterans #UniteBlue
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS  wasting time with empty rhetoric to make you feel better, changes nothing.
@kerrywashington @JustQBreezy @POTUS GUNS ARE NOT VIOLENT. People are!
@kerrywashington @TheBaxterBean @POTUS Tomorrow is promised to no one!  Guns should be the least of your worries!  Sir Wilhelm
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS 
You will never be safe,as long as you believe a lie.
@kerrywashington @POTUS How about the million+ babies murdered by abortion last year. Every one intentionally murdered!
@kerrywashington @POTUS Please explain how anything he did will have  any affect on illegal guns.
@kerrywashington @BarackObama now can we get executive order changing the grand jury process for cops involved in shootings? #timetowakeup
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS and per the CDC 12,000 homicides including both criminals and self defense by firearms  #StopGunViolence
@kerrywashington @POTUS
@kerrywashington @terri_georgia @POTUS he's awesome isn't he?
????? Really?! So how will taking/restricting guns from law abiding citizens keep guns from criminals?

@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS none of those numbers is in any way shape or form accurate
@kerrywashington @POTUS LIAR in Chief
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS Damn if he does-damned if he doesn't.It's sad. Being black w/a name Barack Obama. People are so racist!
@kerrywashington @POTUS 60 million babies aborted,37% white,35% black,22% hispanic,7%other, and instead of bannning it, we give them $$$$$
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS Obama needs to lead by example, disarm Secret Service, we want him to be safe too. Those guns can kill
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS What affect would any of these changes have had on recent mass shootings? I'll help, NONE!
@kerrywashington @POTUS anyone notice all this gun  violence seems to only happen in gun  free zones? More laws won't fix it.
@kerrywashington @POTUS ...we ALL need to be concerned. Thank you Ms. Washington and POTUS
@kerrywashington @POTUS how?  HOW will this make us safer?
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS unfortunately nothing will happen
@kerrywashington @POTUS These steps do nothing.
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS you really are a special kind of stupid aren't you?
@kerrywashington @POTUS buenas noches como esta usted abla español
@kerrywashington  Kerry, what r your thoughts on this old congressional testimony from a female gun violence victim?
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS common sense is admitting criminals do not follow existing laws let alone any laws period!
@kerrywashington @POTUS Worthy of Watching, Reflecting, in remberance, having respect, and holding a moment of silence for families impacted
@kerrywashington @POTUS  what about these steps
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS you are so confused about the cause and action reality
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS Bwahahaha. Idiot.
Do you really feel safer? @kerrywashington These actions are purely token moves. @POTUS
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS but he releases criminals into the public and @gitmo terrorists. WAKE UP. He is looking for attention.
@kerrywashington @POTUS These two belong in jail for treason..
@kerrywashington @POTUS says the wife of django. #StopGunViolence
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS <--His actions are an abuse of power and violate our US Constitution #Impeach
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS It makes no 1 safer. Criminals don't obey gun laws.Look at Chicago-strictest gun laws,highest gun crime
@kerrywashington @POTUS so all the criminals and terrorist are going to run and get background checks and register their guns now,  great!
@kerrywashington @BrandonJRouth @POTUS Obama's the man, but he's not helping to end this issue at all
@kerrywashington @POTUS
@kerrywashington other things that KW  knows.
@kerrywashington @POTUS Guns' damage on the US is nothing compared to drinking and driving where 2 out of 3 americans are affected by it.
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS oh, wow I don't you were in any danger, unless you lived in Chicago. obama's old killing grounds.
@kerrywashington @POTUS @1st glance, I thought you were kidding, @ 2nd, apparently you, like Obama, are incapable of thinking this thru.
@kerrywashington I really like you as an actress but these new laws only affect law abiding citizens.
@kerrywashington @POTUS explain to me what he did NOTHING....criminals don't care about laws..all his examples were with illegal guns anyway
@kerrywashington @WhiteHouse @POTUS Your numbers are false and misleading. Why not use the FBI numbers?
@kerrywashington @POTUS Breathtakingly disingenuous.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3noDpXO110 …
@kerrywashington @BarackObama @POTUS  thank god we-in saudi arabia-dont have a gun proplem. And its because wemen dont drive! #women_drivers
@kerrywashington fact under Obama’s tenure (thru FY ’15), Fed firearms convictions dropped by 25% & at their lowest levels since 2002 #truth
@kerrywashington @POTUS WORTH SHARING: Obama fools rubes by restating existing laws, because most of his followers are morons.
@kerrywashington @POTUS Political Elite, Entertainers, Mind Contras.., THE POLICE,--- Pay to Play[Structural, Pyramid, Greed]Collapse @deray
@kerrywashington @POTUS It isn't gonna have a SINGLE effect. It's not the problem. Sorry
