@joe_paladino @BarackObama you are an idiot lmao hes saying that if congress wont make action he will
@16Frazier @joe_paladino @BarackObama That's not his job, legally or ethically!
@Sherry09 @joe_paladino @BarackObama if its not legal how can it happen
@16Frazier @joe_paladino @BarackObama  it's not going to happen. Obama can sign into law but GOP will defund him. No $ no amnesty.
@Sherry09 @joe_paladino @BarackObama so if obama cant make immigration reforms ; what do you propose congress does
@16Frazier @joe_paladino Make immigrants become citizens the legal way & get in line behind the ones who been here trying for yrs!
@Sherry09 @joe_paladino BUT THEY ARENT DOING THAT . THEY SHOT DOWN ANY ATTEMPT AND BLOCKED PROGRESS
@BarackObama Take your questionable authority and wait til Jan. 2015. You just shot yourself in the foot!
@BarackObama It's difficult being a kind human being :-)

“@BarackObama: When members of Congress question my authority I have a simple answer: Pass a bill.”

@MariaNYC Wish he had acted before Nov 4th. I think it would have helped us keep the Senate and take the house. Miscalculation.
@Jennyablue @MariaNYC democratic candidates lost it by throwing minorities under the bus to not gain white voters.
@T1theinfamous @MariaNYC Agreed. I'm still baffled by it all. How short sighted. I think more ppl would have voted nov 4..
@BarackObama I have a better answer! What time can we expect you resignation.
