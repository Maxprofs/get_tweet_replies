@BarackObama would be an achievement if you'd got them to pledge to reverse climate change,  not a target of 2 degrees
@seanieb1983 @BarackObama he nor anyone can reverse it unfortunately. We are on a nat uptrend that would exist with or w/o human involvement
@Robbiedee88 @BarackObama hardly natural when we've spent 100+ years dumping Co2 into the atmosphere....
@seanieb1983 @BarackObama global warming, global cooling, CO2, methane, et al., have fluctuated naturally for millions of years.
@Robbiedee88 @seanieb1983  but I don't know why I argue, you wouldn't believe you have a nose on your face if @BarackObama said you did
@joshareed no, I believe in keeping the earth preserved as much as anyone, but the unbiased data contradicts the whole movement.
@Robbiedee88 let's apply to real problems like accountability on all those awful politicians.
@joshareed those politicians that claim this crap is real, you believe they will tone down their lifestyle for this shit, no way
@Roope00 @BarackObama thanks Obama
@Roope00 @BarackObama without joking, it's great all the countries signed!
@BarackObama LOOOL https://vine.co/v/iOTQnTYjBvU?bbEA …
@BarackObama @treyptrsn  Hooray! So grateful!
@BarackObama #ParisAgreement I thought it was the world's leadership. Even if it wasn't, it's unwise for America to claim the credit
@BarackObama easy to claim something that is not an imminent threat hmmm? What about that war on terror then, how's that working out for us?
@BarackObama @Scandersoufi good news
@BarackObama American leadership? Sure... North, Central, and South America!
@BarackObama @treyptrsn and how many will genuinely improve things?  It's when countries start doing things wholesale that things happen
@BarackObama Yes thanks to American leadership the sun rises and sets THANK YOU AMERICA
Shut up f**k wad you put the US in its worst position in our history. We know you aren't American and you agenda is to destroy it.
@BarackObama thank you
@BarackObama  آقای اوباما لطفا به مردم سوریه کمک کنید

@BarackObama "Leadership" is not the word I would have used
.@BarackObama Did you forget that your tweets travel abroad? This one is unfair for France and the rest of the world. #ParisAgreement #POTUS
@marcepa49 @BarackObama . America didn't give this joke a Nobel Prize 4 doing nothing. The villiage idiot has spoken, the world may now bow
@BarackObama what leadership?
@BarackObama @treyptrsn United over climate change but divided over terrorism,what a world?
@BarackObama @treyptrsn it's a lie, it's more of China leadership than America's
@BarackObama chat leadership?
.@BarackObama Isn't it thanks to the US that #ParisAgreement is not legally binding? I would have preferred you had no leadership.#POTUS
@BarackObama @bean_kay  YOU got that right its steps in the right directions #ParisAgreement to save the Planet!  Thank you "My President!"
