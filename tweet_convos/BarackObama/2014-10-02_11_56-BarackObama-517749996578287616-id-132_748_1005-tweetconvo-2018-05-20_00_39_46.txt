Thanks @LatinaAnarchist 4 speaking truth to @BarackObama who will destroy public Ed. @NewarkStudents @BadassTeachersA
@Minnsanity @BarackObama @NewarkStudents @BadassTeachersA it's a fight we all need to stand up for or we are as good as lemmings
@BarackObama.  Dear mr B.Obama , I'm very very agree with your action for aducation. I hope not only in America but through all the world
@BarackObama and at a life-time of debt because of it.  #studentloans
@ShayneEmmert @BarackObama yes.... I am going through that right now without help. Grrr
@Blwilson8806 @BarackObama me too.  Perhaps our leader has some suggestions?  :-)
@ShayneEmmert @BarackObama Doubt it. That is just the way our society is today.  I feel that one has to be upper class to get anywhere.
@BarackObama let action follow your speech and let the rest of the world follow the German example
@BarackObama  People from different backgrounds should at least get a chance at working in America and having an college education.
@BarackObama 129.
.@BarackObama 1 way 2 reform is 2 stop school BMI reporting which leads 2 #eatingdisorders in vulnerable kids. 30M in US afflicted & 20% die
@SterlingJoy94 @LisaAnnSpringer So true-needs to stop!
with all due respect - no one leads. Everyone must walk hand in hand @BarackObama
@barackobama Most ignorant thing Ive ever seen. People will succeed more than others its life. Trying to make everyone the same is communist
@BarackObama Start with their parents.
@BarackObama They did before you started reforming..now we just praise the lazy, criminals..such as yourself.
@BarackObama LETS KEEP INDOCTRINATING OUR YOUTH WITH YOUR LIBERAL SOCIALIST BULLSHIT!
@BarackObama The equality in Education.
@BarackObama نحن ننتصﻻ من جديد
@BarackObama love this!! Wish the uk had the same attitude towards education
@BarackObama building d future for our youth
@BarackObama Why bother, when the uneducated can get jobs taking orders at McDonald's making more than college-educated phlebotomists?
@BarackObama AFFORDABLE COLLEGES --Not Loans!  A blank check for loans = Colleges can charge anything. We fail to teach kids about debt.
@BarackObama @obyezeks
@BarackObama  I love u,you are my mentor GOD BLESS U.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama and by success we mean socially engineered to fight the mythical beast of global warming...
@BarackObama You re doing a great job Mr. President.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama by bailing out ppl who bought homes they can't afford, banks 4 bad loans but not ppl getting an education w/ student loans? smh
@BarackObama Then why don't the rich and politician's children take #CommonCore classes? #tcot #tlot #Ccot
@BarackObama Depends on" reforms".  But yes!
@BarackObama but yes... I do believe that everyone deserves a chance. Thank you!
@BarackObama YES... but let's not change the common core standards. It is hard for the new teachers to learn it.
@BarackObama Don't reform education. Get rid of tenure, and pay teachers on students grades. #ThatsHowYouFixEducation
@BarackObama 
Mr. President.
Have tour press secretary announce ALL you have been doing with the economy.message is getting lost.
 “@BarackObama: "Let's keep reforming our education system so young niggas at every level have the same shot at success."—President Obama”
@BarackObama @obyezeks The value of uneducated children is a bleak future. Educating them provides a brighter future. #IsupportEducation
@BarackObama Hallelujah, amen!
@BarackObama get a real job just once in your life, bet your hands are soft
@BarackObama great idea can you bring the cost of college down then??
@BarackObama You can start by getting rid of #CommonCore and giving power back to the states.
@BarackObama @OFA_PA young people at every level have the same shot at success." — Obama #AmericaLeads So far its just a shot at mediocrity
@BarackObama so interesting!
@BarackObama what do you REALLY know about education reform. You mean the "reform" that closes down public schools @LatinaAnarchist
@BarackObama first redistribution of wealth and now redistribution of knowledge
@BarackObama get off twitter homie thanks for the updates though
“@BarackObama: "Let's keep reforming our education system so young people at every level have the same shot at success." #AmericaLeads”
@BarackObama @obyezeks @abati1990 @renoomokri , help Nigeria to improve our Education system so Nigerian can be successful against all odds
@BarackObama the success will be by extending the unemployment benefits
@BarackObama we shouldn't have to all do the same thing to be successful. Whether its 5+5 or 7+3 they both equal 10. The journey is variable
@BarackObama you don't care
@BarackObama 
Those are essencial steps to  succeed as a nation. 
@BarackObama @saintonit Booo hissss
@BarackObama raise teacher salary, give more funding to states for public education, lower tuition at public institutions. #suggestions
@BarackObama Then get the federal government out of the schools and that will happen
@BarackObama it would be great if we had the food we did in school before your wife put that crap in the schools 
@BarackObama The idea of equal possibilities to learn and success for every child has been used here in Finland #elementary #school #Finland
@BarackObama stop waisting stupid money and war and feed the poor and help educate childrean
@BarackObama Did he say "48 states and the District of Columbia"?
@BarackObama <3
@barackobama How about we fix the education system, before taking on new initiatives?Get rid of NCLB!  Ask any teacher and they will tell u!
@BarackObama for instance The Car Industry he lost us Ford, Holden and Toyota. Much needed jobs will go by 2017 with all plants closing
@BarackObama I agree with the basic #Idea of #EDUCATION & recognizes all the Forces against this on both sides of the #FENCE.
@BarackObama So USA start educating and paying your teachers, stop using nationwide tests, shorten the day, give students recess every hour!
@BarackObama #reformthetaxsystemfirst #controlgovtspending
@BarackObama hi I am Dot from Australia, wish you were our Priminister, Abbott is destroying our way of life
@BarackObama definitely needed. I'm struggling to get back in school to finish my bachelors degree & go further in my Career. Loans used.
@BarackObama the education is worse every year in WA.
@BarackObama Reform education by appointing a Secretary of Ed who is an educator. I'll accept one that has taught a single class. Ever.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama We wish. The powers that be have no interest in educating the masses. Easier to manipulate the ignorant!
@BarackObama Let's scrap #Common Core and get Fed out of education instead!
@BarackObama  so do not forget African young because we have a sharp mind ever the world the only thing we left is a chance to education
