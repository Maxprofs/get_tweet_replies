@BarackObama Democracy breaks down when humane n sensitive souls find themselves in a minority in the temples of Democracy
@BarackObama that explains why you forced your healthcare bill through despite overwhelming public opposition... Democracy is broken.
@BarackObama US have representative democracy that is NOT true democracy in fact.
@BarackObama Does the voice ofan average person in Iraq, Afghanistan or another country where your troops cause the death of millions count?
@BarackObama @Mari_Carmela_27
@BarackObama absolutely correct .As long as you see people for who and what they are . You have EARNED democracy but it comes at some price

@BarackObama Like the voices of the American citizens of Puerto Rico do not seem to matter enough to be included in your SOTU.
@BarackObama Mr President I admire you, But even  your suave presidential voice was  mostly ignored, so  really?  My average voice counts! ?
@BarackObama @Jinxie_G As an average person who has never been more ignored by my government, the irony of him saying that is bitter.
@PiperBayard @BarackObama Not disagreeing.
@BarackObama: yes this is real democracy
@BarackObama wait if u see how hard it really is!
@BarackObama I will cry and perhaps die if trump wins. Please" pull some strings" to prevent him.PLEASE!!
