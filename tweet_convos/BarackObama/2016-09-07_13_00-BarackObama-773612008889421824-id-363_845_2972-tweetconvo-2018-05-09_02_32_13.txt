Sadly he didn't get us into two wars and send the country into recession. :( :'(
there are more Americans out of work, there is more racial divide.... he is a FAILURE.
work? Every logistical indicator shows otherwise.
not the unemployment rate. It agrees Obama is indeed a turd
4.9% but you guys think your smarter than the FBI why not the DOL?
Are not counted in the unemployment rate. It will keeping dropping....
higher deductibles, useless insurance. Canceled policies. We can do a lot better than this.
no one has up to now 20 million of your fellow citizens are better off I know you probably don't care
Many countries are doing it FAR better. Obamacare is nothing but a scam for private insurance.
then by all means let some smart politician come up with a better plan will not happen
Bernie's plan was the most common sense to me. Trillions cheaper than Obamacare and what we had before
the man tried to do something for those who really needed it I'm going to give him some credit
oh good! You have insurance? Yay!  May I ask where you got it bc I need some
oh that really good offer with the $6000 deductible? Is that the one you have?
i realize very well. Our insurance tripled bc of this junk n doctors are leaving so yea I've studied up
Where is my $2500 savings and my former Doctor? #LYINGLIAR
@voxdotcom because you are stealing money from hardworking tax payers to pay for those freeloaders
you are a real bait & switch professional.
Now have to pay a huge fine. Smh. Obamacare sucks.
THATS BECAUSE YOU FORCE US AMERICANS TO PAY A GOD DAMN FINE IF WE ARE NOT INSURED, #REPEALOBAMACARE
Good morning
you're so delusional you don't even see the right numbers. You can keep your own doctor remember?
@voxdotcom more people are paying higher premiums than ever before, thanks to Obamacare(Idontcare)
@voxdotcom bullshit lies . If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. If you like your medical insurance. Lies.  Asshole
come live in Tennessee. Your healthcare law has really fucked things up here
#Obamacare is turning into a huge fiasco.Please publish the astronomical hikes coming in November.
Middle class workers are paying for it!  My health costs went up 40%.  Sick of paying more to insure illegals and deadbeats.
The American Dream doesn't involve me paying for illegal & lazy people here.
what about the lower class that can't afford it?
Yep, they got a lousy health insurance for which in fact the middle class pays while you forced people to buy a private product
your ACA forced me and my family out of having insurance.  Where do we fit into your chart?
And my premiums and deductibles are way higher and coverage is less.
RT @BarackObama: https://twitter.com/BarackObama/statuses/773612008889421824 … and fewer can afford insurance. Thanks.
Fewer Americans are uninsured than ever before, thanks to #Obamacare. http://ofa.bo/2cilNlT 
it didn't help me AT ALL. I'm not paying for other people. You didn't think about the middle class.
thanks Mr. President
oh good! You have insurance? Yay!  May I ask where you got it bc I need some
I went online through my state's website, compared packages in my budget and went with a coverage plan with @AnthemPR_CA.
@ some contemporary White Citizens won't give you credit but I think history will look favorably at this accomplishment
geeeez. Why only whites. Do you not think some blacks think the same thing?
I don't know any your black friends.
more are at war, in jail, or out of the work force

We're going broke paying for it.
greatest lie ever! We can't afford stinking #Obamacare hate what you've done worst potus ever!
yet another lie !
I pay $900 more a mouth. I see my doctor once a year. $900.00  for a family of 3. Total $1,189 What am I saving? #Obamacare
at the expense of the middle class. You robbed Peter to give to Paul. Not saying they didn't need help, but now so does Peter.
oh, I take that back, if anyone in my family goes 2 the doctor we have 2 pay an extra $150 because insurance doesn't cover it.
Preach that to the uneducated and moronic libertard and demorat, the rest of us know that's BS.
not in WA. @BNBuzz only works employees 20 hours to avoid paying insurance. Likewise the other Corps.
on account it you made it law!! My thanks to you that I have to pay $1200 a mo. up from $600.
Who are you counting? Americans, deplorables?
Don't forget working class can't afford to see a doctor now or buy medicine do to Obama care.
You didn't thinking about many people need have insurance health. People did have cancer and heart disease is worse!
nothing to do with the fact the country needs it for their pain killers you are throwing at em? You're now their main dealer.

If congress would of passed Full care plan we would of  had better prices, & a recourse to go against insurance co.'s.
Coverage is what you choose or can gamble w/life. Out of my 700$ S.S. pay 160.mo. for medicare., S.S. is my only $ I get.
Asked over 2m & all but 16 said they would of been in financial trouble if it wasn't for Obama care, have research Insurance co
@voxdotcom it's called welfare bud FREE MANY CAN'T AFFORD OBAMACARE

The victory is the people.
@sfrancisatx OK, but the trade-offs have been reduced coverage for certain procedures and higher overall healthcare costs.
those costs were going up before ACA as well.
. Probably Brits too, I shouldn't wonder.
@voxdotcom freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to  do remitted back to the United States, to be fast
my co-pays doubled, deductible and premiums up. Where's our promised $2500 savings per family?
@voxdotcom
@voxdotcom No matter what people say. You have helped so many of us with the Affordable care act. Thank You Mr President!
@voxdotcom I love that your initials are BO, because everything about you stinks.  #worstpresidentever next to Clinton at least
@voxdotcom 
Mr president please we demand you to stop genocide in Ethiopia we know you can do it.
#Obamacare Was the stability of security, that an American President
if dared to give the middle class and poor Americans.
I lost my plan, my doctor, and now face a 34% rise in rates. Yep, this failure is hailed again as a success.
@voxdotcom bacon
@voxdotcom ffg
@voxdotcom My employer change my health care plan this year I have already paid over $7,000 and copays and coinsurance
@voxdotcom Now i am insured I eat more bacon!!
Obozocare isn't health  insurance. It's a fraud on the American people just like Obama. It's all but useless.
people should fire every democrap who forced this on them and their families.
only because you forced it on people who cannot afford to use the insurance because of high premiums and huge deductibles.
im not insured and i have to wait till November! And more people being insured doesnt mean better quality! TRUMP2016! repeal it
I actually have insurance now thanks to you !!  Can't you just stay in office? You're GREAT! Just stay ! Lol please !
@voxdotcom Dude, put the crack back! You mean you got some people to enroll be strong armed "mandate"?? Freakin Joke!!
it's more complex and  ridiculous.   Simply does not work.  
@voxdotcom - If all governors in all states would work with ACA, health care would be even less expensive, (insurance buddies)
Yes Mr. President but how much does that coverage cost families for how much coverages.  Prices up.  Coverage down.
Thank you very much, OBAMA! Please also keep leading the world now
@voxdotcom who runs this account?
yet they're not in debt due to taxes from Obamacare, that's prez
now*
We appreciate you, President Obama, for caring enough to establish a means for all Americans to be insured.
A FACT!!
If you DON'T have INSURANCE you go to JAIL just like you should be in JAIL for TREASON!
These numbers could better if everyone really tried to finish fixing our health care system instead of obstructing progress.
@voxdotcom too expensive for people who only make around $10 an hour.
and still can't afford to go to the doctor. Affordable health care my ars
I'm paying way more for worse insurance; on my third plan; had to switch doctor after 15 years. Thanks man!
just like you were suppose to help our vets" but instead spent over a million dollars on decorations! POS! @USAMiIitary
@voxdotcom Eight years ago I heard you speak on TV and knew you would be our president. Man of peace. You done a great job.
Obama lies just like Clinton' more people today have zero care. tell the Truth & Shame the Devil.
but the insurance is not worth having and way to expensive. Insurance paying 40% of bill is not affordable.
Yeah because we get fined otherwise. I like you bro, but give me the freedom to be uninsured without penalty please
You spelled "unemployed" incorrectly. @BarackObama
Fewer Americans are uninsured than ever before, thanks to #Obamacare. http://ofa.bo/2cilNlT 
@voxdotcom Health insurance  should be equal to all. As a balance,not tipping to the poor nor the rich. Premiums the same.
@voxdotcom @lesson to Nigerian leaders
obamacare is a disaster and will implode shortly.
@voxdotcom Out here in the US some people get discounts and other ones have to pay more to make up for others discounts.
@voxdotcom It can't stay like it is because insurance  companies  are over pricing people. More laws needed  on this issue.
@voxdotcom That's good but pricing my healthcare, mine is 500 a month or more for my coverage. Please help ! Twig it to help!
humor I get it... 30 million LOSE insurance so 20 million can get insurance, typical liberal fuqtard logic
@voxdotcom Obama ripoff
@voxdotcom maybe insured but it doesn't pay unless you get hit by a truck you made Doctor's go out of business
@voxdotcom  well done @POTUS . it all started like a joke but now we can see the results

Because Insurance companies keep jacking up the costs for their pockets and they could give a f**k about people.
the deductible needs to be a lot lower though! I am paying a $4500 dollar per year crazy
Poor have to have it, but still can't afford it.
@voxdotcom I can't believe you would even mention that disastrous insurance.
@DemHugh @voxdotcom Thank you sir, I love my Obamacare
can’t wait for my premiums to go down!

not true but ok...
@voxdotcom Congrats on that great work, but the percentage would be much better if GOP had allowed a gov't option. Shame, GOP!
only because of not we will be penalized.  Pay for the insurance can't afford the doctor!
thanks for the $600 monthly premiums...
We're gonna miss Obama.
