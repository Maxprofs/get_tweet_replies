@Only4RM @AB_Owl @BarackObama  So China changes nothing, and increases its filthy pollution for another 16 years and Obama makes a gesture.
@Detracter No. BY 2030 China will need to have 20% renewable energy, to start. That doesn't happen overnight. @AB_Owl @BarackObama
@Detracter For scale, 20% of China's energy needs is 100% of US energy production today.  @AB_Owl @BarackObama
@Only4RM @AB_Owl @BarackObama  China is building 207 nuclear power stations to reduce their terrible pollution.
