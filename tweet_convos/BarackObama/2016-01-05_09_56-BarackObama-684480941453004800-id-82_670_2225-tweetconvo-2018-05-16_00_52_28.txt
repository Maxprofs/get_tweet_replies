@questlove @BarackObama = Give up #SecretService #RebootLiberty
@questlove @BarackObama why not tell the truth about violence & admit where it starts...fatherless homes.
@questlove @BarackObama Guns are NOT the problem, they are a tool used by criminals. Should we ban spoons because they make us fat?  Choices
@questlove @BarackObama GENIUS KNOWS!
@questlove @BarackObama It's the Greed or NRA & Hate of @GOP that stop Progress. How will they feel if they lost family to Gun Violence ?

@questlove @BarackObama The principal is the same as the war on Drugs... Whatever u do it won't change nor solve anything.
@questlove @BarackObama this isn't solving anything... Will it stop illegal gun use/buying? Of course not!
@questlove @BarackObama Americans commit genocide ! How many senseless MILLIONS lost since John Lennon 1980 ? Thank you Mr. President !

@TheDeansList1 @questlove @POTUS .
@questlove Why didn't he pass all these laws when he was president and the democrats had control of the house and senate

@questlove Amen!!!! 
@questlove
NYS requires background checks for those who desire to teach. Why question the necessity of background checks for those who desire to shoot?
@questlove gun control harms blacks more than whites, like all progressive policies, it is inherently racist.
@questlove How is this going to stop mass shootings
@questlove be proud to have your picture with the man trying his best to change it!
