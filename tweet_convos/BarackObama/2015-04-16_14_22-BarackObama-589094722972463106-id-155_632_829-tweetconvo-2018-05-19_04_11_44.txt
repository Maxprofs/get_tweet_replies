@OFA @BarackObama @HillaryClinton
@OFA @BarackObama #ActOnClimate Centuries ago, some banned saying the earth was round.  That didn't make it so. We need to act.
@OFA @BarackObama what is OFA? Obama f@cking America? Climate change is BS
@OFA @BarackObama I can't understand climate deniers. The world is changing. We destroyed our planet & we have the science to prove it.
@OFA @BarackObama you didnt know? "if we ignore it, the problem will go away!" it worked for hitler, and it will work for climate change.

@fabiaceae @OFA Banning the phrase "climate change" is illegal & a challenge to the Bill of Rights. In other words, they can't get away w/it
@OFA @BarackObama The use of the term "climate change" encompasses our right to free speech. It cannot be outlawed w/o attacking Bill ofRgts
@OFA @BarackObama Just did a market report for solar energy in Florida.Not surprised by this when they have few incentives for clean energy
@OFA @BarackObama true, unskewed science says there have been tropic and Ice ages before. The climate is changing but it's nothing new.

@OFA @BarackObama talking about fantasy land climate change will not draw enough attention away from the inexcusable job you are doing.
