@WhiteHouse @POTUS By "we" you mean the GOP majority in the House and Senate that forced the sequester that curtailed your spending plans.
@SWNID @WhiteHouse @POTUS Good one-Trump will really fix the deficit----ENOUGH SOCIALISM they don't know the definition of!
@GypsyRider2015 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Trump? OK. 
@SWNID @WhiteHouse @POTUS SON, YOU BETTER HOPE OUR MARCH TO SOCIALISM IS STOPPED-The Trump has a bulldozer that can do that!
@GypsyRider2015 @WhiteHouse @POTUS On what evidence do you base your confidence in the real estate hustler and TV personality Mr. Trump?
@swnid @potus @whitehouse And so you must think being a socialist is a better direction? You think the last 7 years were all honest & open ?
@GypsyRider2015 @POTUS @WhiteHouse That's a false choice: Trump or Democrat. I prefer my politicians conservative, experienced, articulate.
@swnid @potus @whitehouse Anybody can hire a speech writer and appear to be articulate-Trump talks to the commoner and is first GOP for that

It's cute how people crow about reducing the annual budget by billions while increasing the debt by trillions.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS reducing the rate of growth isn't really reducing at all...anymore than unemployment insurance creates jobs

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama National Debt approaching $20 Trillion - Obama's spending alone, almost $10 Trillion!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS The National Debt is the alarming figure as Obama has spent more than EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT COMBINED!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Deficit means they are reducing the over spending year after year!

@WhiteHouse @ojstewart @POTUS Show the 4 years before Obama took office! This past year is still larger than any of those four years!
@WhiteHouse @ojstewart @POTUS And the national debt has almost doubled to $18 TRILLION. Who do you think you are kidding?

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama But what have you done to the debt then?! #StopScammingAmerica
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS liars, nothing but lies
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  LIE!! Why are u raising medicare costs? Why no S.S raise? Cause Dems hate Americans & support illegals!
@Sherry09 The lack of SS gain is due to the CPI not increasing all that much. cost of living stayed constant. Doesnt make sense to raise it
@kylemannisi Not true! There has only been two times in over 40 years that S.S did not get an increase and both times were under Obama.
@Sherry09 at least i dont vote politicians into office that try to cut Social Security, VA benefits, and the Dept of Education (republicans)
@kylemannisi   Sure you do. You just won't admit it. All have been cut by Dems for the past 6+ years. Fact check it!
@WhiteHouse Thank You Prez
@WhiteHouse @POTUS that is false advertisements, oops this is politics.
