@nytimes پرزیدنت اوباما واقعا انسان با شرفی هستند ولی تندرو های آمریکا نقطه مقابل او هستند کاش رابطه با ایران را درست میکند.
convicting arsonists might help.
@nytimes Do you think the Donald can stop global warming too while he single handedly  saves the world? Ha ha
Human beings are part of a creative expression of life during these times.
stop & search trees, seize tree assets w/o due process, have inland tree checkpoints, do it for the saplings. #EndTheDrugWar
@nytimes maybe we need more firefighters
@TrumpIsRacism So why is the Democratic Party supporting fracking?
Wildfire seasons are getting longer, more dangerous, and more expensive. We need to do more to #ActOnClimate. http://ofa.bo/2au2V07 
you need to tell your Muhammad pigs to stop playing with fire
@nytimes 
I agree and great speech last night.
But hurricanes are getting less frequent and less strong, despite prior claims. 

Explain.
And raise taxes to keep wood from drying out? Climate change is a sham.

Perhaps, but that doesn't mean we're responsible and, if we're not, "acting" as you suggest would do nothing.

Mr.President, are you for or against death penalty ?
Necessary to take care of nature that God has given us.
Although this article blames fire suppression techniques rather than climate change for the increase in the size of fires.
@nytimes Yes nice to know you're still concerned about current problems

@nytimes Sir, All this is happening when we have a US Presidential candidate who thinks climate change is a myth.
@nytimes Enyoy the woods....not burn them....they are life.....
Then why have the #CrookedDNC been blasting AIR CONDITIONERS ALL WEEK at the #DemConvention #DemsInPhilly ???????
90% of all wildfires are started by people. What exactly has that got to do with climate?
Obama wants fires as he can blame them on global warming but that is bunch of crap & more of his & AlGore lies & money makers
Rein in FERC! No more natural gas pipelines!
Go back in time and start doing control burns again & fire will go way down. Now more fuel to burn, but tree huggers love this

@nytimes If only we could mingle countries.

@nytimes en un futuro hay que evitar con más medios los incendios forestales, como los cortafuegos, detectores de humos, etc.
Meanwhile you travel in a car and in a plane that does what? Ever thought about that? I know I wont get an answer from you.
Shame then that majority are arson
You have to be locked up for a very very long time.
Remember when @realDonaldTrump said climate change is a Chinese conspiracy? What a nutcase! I would never say that.
