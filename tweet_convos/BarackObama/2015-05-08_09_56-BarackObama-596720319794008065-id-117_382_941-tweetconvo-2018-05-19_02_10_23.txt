@BarackObama What is the difference between a free trade agreement and a "smart" trade agreement?
@anirudhsbh @BarackObama Only that a 'free trade' must be good for both parties and a 'smart agreement' is for each 'side' to work out. -bdl
@bigdavelittle You mean it's for crony interests from both sides to work it out in case of "smart" trade agreements. @BarackObama
@anirudhsbh @BarackObama Mmm well fair trade means to me, that if you make a spoon & I want it, I don't have to pay un fairly. -bdl
@bigdavelittle What's fair and what's unfair? Who decides? @BarackObama
@anirudhsbh @BarackObama Well here (US) we put our Pres. in charge of that. Sometimes we have not picked very good ones.
@bigdavelittle Sounds unAmerican, because I always thought Americans preferred to be free to decide for themselves. @BarackObama
@anirudhsbh @BarackObama Ah these are world trade agreement? I think we're done. Maybe you should just make better spoons to trade.
@64619183ead54c7 @BarackObama Howz the fishin?
@64619183ead54c7 @BarackObama I'm stuck going to the store for fish! Happy fishing! -bdl
@64619183ead54c7  PS: That's one big ass fish your holdin!! lol
@BarackObama I'm not sure why you're pandering to corporate America with this deal. This is my biggest disappointment in you, Mr. President.
@jacob_b_shaver @barackobama Mr. President, every day you've worked for middle class.  Thank you for your TPP efforts, they are appreciated
@swilli0521 @BarackObama Please explain to me how this trade deal will help the American people. I think Ms. Warren has it right on the $$.
@BarackObama Agree
@BarackObama and what do you know about economics you've done everything you can to destroy ours
@BarackObama  "I view smart trade agreements as a part of middle-class economics."   HOW MUCH MORE BULLSHIT CAN WE TAKE!
@BarackObama I think you are the best President since Kennedy, maybe better. But, sadly, there is no more middle class. CU ended democracy.
@BarackObama thisish stone from garut city west java indonesia...waterjump..nice to you

@BarackObama
@BarackObama too bad the TPP isn't a 'smart'agreement. Secret corporate tribunals get to decide if US laws stand in the way of their profits
@BarackObama that's the same middle class you put in the tolit for the last 7 years?
@BarackObama Leconomia borgese non va bene perché riduce i consumi bloccando le indostrie
@BarackObama make lacrosse an Olympic sport
@BarackObama It's a part of economics, period. But I agree enough to retweet.
@BarackObama Mr. President you and your administration are doing a great job, thank you.
@BarackObama how are middle class jobs going to be here when they're .50 an hour in Vietnam?
@BarackObama I voted for you 2x.Now,the TPP will destroy the few good paying jobs we have left.I'm so against it.If so good, why so shady?!
@BarackObama you're blind then

@BarackObama يا سيادة الرئيس: لا زال الشعب السوري ينتظر أن تساعدوه في التخلص من الظلم والدكتاتور الذي يقتل الاطفال والنساء ."باسم الانسانية.
@BarackObama Not always so. Too simple a statement. YK
@BarackObama  Maybe it's a good deal, but again maybe it's not.The working class can't afford to bet again on "maybe" - NO TPP!
@BarackObama views pro-corporate trade agreements as a part of upper-class economics #LeadOnTrade
@BarackObama Then tell us specifically what is smart about the agreements and what industries want them other than foreign ones.
@BarackObama I view smart trade agreements as something that should benefit all equally.
@BarackObama Obama is ruining our country.  He has no clue about economic,  with middle class people.  He is a Muslim
@BarackObama Толку от того, что ты просмотр,баран ..???!!!(((
@BarackObama Another catch phrase to attempt to win support.
@BarackObama you can't put money in middle class pockets by purchasing foreign goods and services!  #StopobamasSpinDoctoring
@BarackObama this might come as a shock to you but corporations are not the middle class
@BarackObama your just sending money overseas. Bring manufacturing back to the US. #StopobamasSpinDoctoring
@BarackObama Then tell us what's in it while we still exist #DetailsPlease
@BarackObama and the rest of us view TPP as a tragedy in the making.
@BarackObama have you provided details on the plan? This has been your worst show of transparency, Barry O.

@BarackObama #TPP Obama and Mitch McConnell go to bed with each other and the working class gets screwed
@BarackObama situation and peoples mind.thanks
@BarackObama  Every time the federal gov. does something for or in the name of the middle-class the middle-class ends up getting SCREWED!
@BarackObama  If you mean destroying the middle class by shipping more industrial jobs overseas and replacing them with lower paying jobs...
@BarackObama actually viewer point generate by bottom to top level human nature
and lifestyle ,and take desertions watch the current ...
@BarackObama I view smart trade agreements like #ttip as a threat to European middle-class economics. #takes2totango
@BarackObama How about for the less prosperous class as seen in #Baltimore ? How do the poor make out with #tpp? #Wageslaves
@BarackObama Good Afternoon that is correct you have to be smarter about what is going to be traded #be smart about what you investigate in
@BarackObama 
Trade agreements should have middle class customer as focus. Global growth should make essential goods accessible to masses.

@BarackObama sorry, your wrong on trade. It kills middle class. Look at NAFTA, not buying it.
@BarackObama just do it...e... i don't know what i say
@BarackObama courage!
@BarackObama ;  US manufacturing is not evident. Most things are made in China. Not much hiring of engineers in the US for a very long time.
@BarackObama Mule+40 acres time. Stimulus for 1)electric car 2)solar/wind home energy 3)GI Bill 4)college Give Americans a pick of the 4.
@BarackObama Key word: smart.  #NoTPP #FreeTradeIsNotFree
@BarackObama if the TPP is so good, let We, The People read the details. I trust @SenSanders @SenWarren more than YOU on this. #stopTTIP
@BarackObama like youreally care

Mid class is stepping stone 2 American dream
@BarackObama Except not one trade agreement signed starting with NAFTA has helped the middle class. SHOW THE TPP TO THE PUBLIC!
@BarackObama  manufacturing jobs are mostly the reason middle class boomed in the past so they are a important part of the economy!
