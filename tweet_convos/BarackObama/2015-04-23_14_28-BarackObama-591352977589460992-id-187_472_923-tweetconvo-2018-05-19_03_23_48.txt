@BarackObama let the TPP see the bright light of day. It must be reviewed by minimally congress
@BarackObama That's why you are pushing for fast-track on TPP?  Secrecy and outside forces are the way to go?  For shame.
@BarackObama It already does. That's why Apple et. al. exploit Asian workers (#ICantBelieveItsNotSlavery!) & Google et al pay zero tax here
