@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS No 'man' named Merrick is the right 'man' for ANY job.
You should check on what Harry Reid had to @WhiteHouse @POTUS say about that in 2005.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS The GOP has had one goal since Obama's election, to block everything he does. It's racism & dirty politics, not democracy
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS he had a fair shake. They saw who you nominated and said fuck you #getoverit
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I hope this obstructionism from the GOP will cause them to lose the Senate. Do your job or else. #electdems

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Republic Senate should condo firm him.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  I think Garland is a good choice, but him being from the politically corrupt city of Chicago scares me.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS #DoYourJob
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS We won't have enough to worry about this year if we confirm instead of keeping it open to wonderment?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS With respect: He sided WITH the creation of Super PAC's which allows more dark money in politics.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I voted for you twice because you said you would get Money out of politics. No movement on this...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse @POTUS yeah good luck

@WhiteHouse @POTUS BHO nominee for SCOTUS is a BHO man he's a strong  1st & 4th amendment person but doesn't support 2nd no hearing no vote

@Skunkmilk @WhiteHouse @POTUS spoken like someone that has their head buried in the sand. Grow up, and give up the insults
@joezerona @WhiteHouse @POTUS spoken like someone who has Obamas ball sweat on your chin
@Skunkmilk @WhiteHouse @POTUS you prove your intelligence,  and maturity us too low to vote.
@joezerona @WhiteHouse @POTUS well im mature enough to know id never vote for someone limiting my rights
@WhiteHouse @kerrywashington @POTUS looks good to me meet someone in their right to keep it going I was trying to do with you right

@WhiteHouse @SCOTUSnom @POTUS 
Merrick Garland complicit w OKC bombing cover-up per Eric Holder's instructions. Garland is anti Second Amend
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Wrong he's a moderate! He couldn't even carry Scalia's robe!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  I think he would be great but Obama needs to get back to his expensive taxpayer parties in the WHITE house and hush
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  leave it to the next Potus in 2017 to pick a nominee. Let the American people make the choice.#SCOTUSnominee 2017
@WhiteHouse @POTUS No he ain't!  He's left wing gun grabber, no friend of the Second Amendment.  Wrong man for the job!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS what
@WhiteHouse @POTUS no
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it's not up to the White House it is up to the Senate tell that to the king
@WhiteHouse @POTUS The little ads about the nominee is designed to play on our emotions. If he is the right man, why the ads. Games we play

@WhiteHouse @POTUS Are you rushing this because you know Hillary will lose to Trump?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS BIDEN RULE!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Ha! Looks like the Biden rule is in full effect!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Obama  could have selected Mitch McConnell  himself and Mitch McConnell would argue against his own confirmation.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS HELL NO!
@MeMellgren @WhiteHouse @POTUS Who said anything about hatred?! You have to have balance from a complete leftist court.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Bullshit!! This is an attack on our Second Amendment rights!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS #MerrickGarland is not a moderate. Try again. #SCOTUSnominee This is akin to tampering with the election process
@djaznh @WhiteHouse @POTUS how is this tampering with the election process?
@WhiteHouse @ErrolCNN @POTUS this was beautiful to watch. If our ELECTED Senators don't confirm this man, will be just shameful.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS So, the President calls Trump a 'Reality Show Host', then turns his @SCOTUS pick into a 'Reality Show Host'...classic!
@curtiswright @WhiteHouse @POTUS @Scotus that Obama joke may have sounded good in your head but I threw up a little in my mouth reading it.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Great pick, President Obama! "He's not qualified, but Trump is qualified to be president"?? Give me a break!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  I never heard of the name "Merrick" before so I don't trust him
@tommieboy77 @WhiteHouse @POTUS John Merrick
