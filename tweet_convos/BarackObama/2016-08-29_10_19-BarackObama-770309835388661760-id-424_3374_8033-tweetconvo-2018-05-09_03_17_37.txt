"not red states or blue states, but the UNITED States." Obama is all talk. #fauxbama
You are an American Patriot who HATES the duly elected President?
I am a patriot that hated a leader that wants to use his power to change the country I love, not improve it!
Dude, do you enjoy being ignorant? U better put on ur uniform bc ur abt 2b schooled!
I enjoy allowing the American people to decide the next generation of cases & not a divisive Pres
Be careful what you pray for.
I think republicans are willing to take that risk. Death by poison or gun is still dead
I don't care much for the Denior Senator from Kentucky but everything you do 0bama must be stopped. #BOStinks
#DoYourJob
I´m from Belgium,a country led by compromises.I  don´t have any understanding for the behavior of this senate!
we used to compromise
except improving your golf game. You have been THE worst president in history, but no one will know because you dems are
For sure!!!!
And thus we have another reason why Obama couldn't get things done.  Republicans are to BLAME!
this kids spends a. Lot of time in Twitter. It's like it's a job or something
Should not have the right to appoint anyone. Should be the next President.
Mitch what do you do to earn your pay? My opinion you haven't worked hard enough to deserve a day on the links!
I have a life out of Twitter & I'm happy with my four followers! I'll have 10 by New Years...
@fabucat @SenateMajLdr We deserve a hearing then NO! vote. We cannot afford another SCOTUS Justice who supports Citizens United
The job of POTUS is to serve the USA, not globalism
obstruction of those who infringe on arms is great!
Mitch McConnell should be forced to resign for not doing his Constitutional job
we the people will be very happy when your out of office . You suck as a leader , you will go down as the worst
exactly!
If the President can only serve 8 years, no one else should serve until death! Too much job security!
@hellfir86226146 (insight by http://commun.it )
realy
lost me at 'my main job is to make @BarackObama a one-term president."
I can't believe this is your proudest moment......very sad!
I agree they have an important job to do.  We need to know why Hillary is not in prison for her illegal actions.
don't worry he will be approved or rejected the day after the election
Barry, if you were a True Leader, you wouldn't have to lie. Admit your a Muslim, Michelle is transgender it's OK.
j
Lowdown dirty asshole that use our tax dollars as they deem.  Then at the end of the year they say we need more!
McConnell should be one of the first to be voted out of office
I so agree. This is what happens when Republicans don't even consider working with a wonderful President. I love.
do your job Mr President and deport illegal immigrants.   #closetheboarder
rewriting it to fit your narrative. #DoYourJob #TrumpPence16 !!!!!
how about you do YOUR job?!Oh yeah, I forgot, you've been too busy vacationing the past 7.5 years to get anything accomplished
we can talk about "obstruction" after you have learned to enforce existing law #immigration #PPACA #NoGolfing
oh please Your Corporateer nominee #Garland is NO PRIZE for the People #StopTPP #NOTPP @VA_Liberal @SenateMajLdr
you @BarackObama need impeached for over reaching your power @USSupremeCourt needs to stop you. @SenateMajLdr should help
@AlamoOnTheRise @SenateMajLdr / no work, no pay; just like rest of world!!
they r doing there job by clicking Obama's nomination.
@AlamoOnTheRise @SenateMajLdr throw the bums out
wasting tax payer money on lavish vacations is irresponsible
@tkdmike @SenateMajLdr Pres. Obama is the greatest president we've ever had.
@mari_silvie
When are term limits and outrageous pensions going to be changed. Mitch should have left 28 years ago!
@BarackObama @SenateMajLdr
How can you criticize anyone when you and your wife
go on vacation on our dime. DO YOUR JOB
If I refused to do my job for months, I'd be fired. The American people deserve a full Supreme Court.
Obstruction, aka checks and balances, is their job....#SupremeCourt
exactly. Charge Hillary
so tired of your propoganda
Thank you Senator! BORK him. No Garland 2016
Proud because you haven't done anything else to be proud of. You should be ashamed to say you're proud.
While your trying to stop the President from doing his job; do yours.
Proud to be a redneck.
when did it become okay to be so disrespectful of your president!! Shame on you!!
# Visa Grant Notice/Face
@LeslieMarshall @SenateMajLdr you do realize that JFK would be a right wing nut in today's DNC https://youtu.be/fSZSbIAZlpQ 
@michlee310910 @realDonaldTrump  you the #POTUS should know is someone finally realizing how much damage you did?
true
it's time for McConnell to go the way of the dinosaur...
Inexcusable!  And what are they going to do if Hillary wins?  Not act for at least the next 4 years?
The MajLdr has made the last decade of his career about obstruction.  Why stop now?
funny you were all for it when W had the reins.
@JDMahama @Kojokaba @attumbu
The Senate needs to push for Obama's impeachment! Traitor

Mitch hates the constitution. @BarackObama @SenateMajLdr
The GOP would set the country on fire if D's went a year with only 8 justices on SCOTUS. @BarackObama
i'm almost speechless on how childish old men care more about cheap personal wins than their country!

The Turtle stepped in it again-Hillary may withdraw Garland and appoint Obama to the seat on the court.
What's sadder is when you have an electoral system that allows it.
Proud of you Mitch.....one of the few things you've said that I agree with
Mitch McConnell is the major cause of Washington's disfunctional behaviour. The face of anger,racism and hate.
If I didn't do my job, I'd be terminated immediately. Maybe we should have the same policy for senators.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, u no what's going on
The senate will not stop blocking the appointment.They are just stalling for the ending of presidential term.
that's RIGHT #DOYOURJOB  #BUCKO
they represent us, and we don't want your nominee. There's a reason they have a say. You're not a king.
the pathetic obstruction to @Scotus has been juvenile and harmful to the USA #DoYourJob @SCOTUSnom
You said it! I would never have the arrogance not to do my job... They should also refuse to pay themselves.
Do your job Congress!
So why haven't you filled the seat as a recess appointment, Mr. President?
Horrible!
NEED SAME  OF THIS SENATE, THINK AMERICANS, THEM; ALL TIME OF THE PRESIDENT OBAMA,ALL TIME OF HOLIDAY,CAN THIS?
sad and unlawful.
The Congress has Failed America for YEARS. The Greedy Biased, Haters in Congress Need To Be Voted OUT...TIME'S UP
@spiritmoon7 @SenateMajLdr GOP got kicked out of California politics due to not following ppl will. GOP lost their way $$$$$$$
he also said his main purpose was to prevent Obama 's re-election. How did that work out for him?
@mitchmcconnell

Shameful
#DoYourJob #MitchMcConnell #Turtle #notAHeroInAhalfShell #noTurtlePower #tooManyHashtags

@SpeakerRyan #DoYourJob Derelict in your duties #StrongerTogether




@LeslieMarshall @SenateMajLdr the hallmArk of democracy. You werent made dictator
lying about paying ransom is nothing to be proud of
Hate to say it but if he can stop you from passing #TPP as he claims then he'll be doing us a favor.
I want Donald to appoint
they should not be paid for wasted time #DoYourJob
Yes it is. YOU are a Pres. NOT to be Proud of. I pd my SS and MED I am 71 U r taking mine to give to ur refugees
it won't matter. Lehman Brothers will be voted in next election, and you'll get your nominee.
#ThePresidentWhoDon'tKnowJesusChrist.
Chuck  Grassley has lost my upcoming IA Sen. vote and I'm voting for Patty Judge. Chuck & Mitch pls retire
We all know the deal: Mitch McConnell and the other racists  in Congress can't accept we have a black president.
that old man needs to retire.making a salary for doing nothing.
Supreme Court Justice Now!!! Vote
freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. remitted back to the United States,
freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. After freezing the account,remitted back to the United States,
that's pretty sad Mitchy
@sherrilee7 @BarackObama @SenateMajLdr Mitch,you do know that generations of students will be learning how you destroyed the GOP
No TO Garland - an ANTI 2nd Amendment LIBERAL out to take away more personal FREEDOMS!
Obama has obstructed justice ever since he has been in office.Person pulling his strings should be in jail too!
It must be nice to get paid for your job even when you don't do it! #DoYourJob
I guess we will fine out when they start subtracting 7 billion - 5 million= death for the other billions
DO YOUR JOBS! OR NOT! WE'LL GET DEMS THAT CAN DO THE JOB! GOP HAS HAD ENOUGH TIME! TOO LATE
to be honest guys the people is tied of all of you. A lot of you sold us out, tell us who up there is for us
Do you suppose that they are obstructing you because you're a Democrat AND because you're Black?
now the GOP wonders why they have the presidential candidate that their electorate selected. That's their example
Mitch McConnell as the Senate Majority leader has failed the people of the United States by acting as a demogue
@RoyalFamily @otepofficial Gods an Atheist
I hope now he becomes it
I should take a notes?
@DWilloughy @SenateMajLdr  fucface McConnell do your fucking job!
..so embarrassed by the GOP!
Nothing to be proud of.  Pure political obstructionism.  Not a trace of statesmanship.
neither is handing over our country to the invading hoards, but yet you are.
omg "we" are all sickened by these people
Respect.
and neither is bullying a policy
,I agree with u Cammander In Cheif #DoYourJob ;
they should be very proud when sanity and reason are at stake. #stallthescotus
This Supreme Court Nomination Stall is a Bloody Shame and a Blemish on our Constitution. Senat be responsible!
Appointing justices to SCOTUS that have no respect for the constitution is even less worthy of pride.
#miserableoldbastard
In affect, WE the PEOPLE pay Mitch McConnell $193,000 a year to oppose us, ie Garland & Planned Parenthood &.....
Wherein the constitution does it permit McConnell to ignore, WE the PEOPLE, the masters of congress & the courts
Do your job.    Your lack of respect for our President is pathetic.  The House and Senate need term limits.
@ ##SOS!!! we need you to advise Ali Bongo to reconize Jean Ping as winner of this Election
You've had 8 years to damage America, Barry.
withholding the consent of the Senate is the Job! @GOP @TheDemocrats
Please help me understand how congress can block President Obama's nominee for Supreme Court Justice?
You break laws and obstruct justice all the time. Hypocrite!

he needs to know Americans have enough of his BS
GOP plan is to discredit Obama. This deplorable strategy is Bad for America.
What can we expect from this old fart, nothing!  They just want to make it harder for you wait till Hillary becpr
you know I started. My life as a republican, this is NOT the party of my father!  10 Yrs Democrat now!
Don't worry POTUS, Sec Clinton will get to nominate 3 SCOTUS, I'm sure they'll start considering Garland b4 Nov 8
I'm also thinking that politically @SenateMajLdr is feeling kind of like an ass right now. He's screwed.

How long did it take the Senate to act on Alito? Did senators refuse to meet him? Did he get committee hearings?
#doyourjob
Worst president in history. #fraud
they are doing their. Past mistakes should not be repeated.
@WhiteHouse Sn Obama Fetullah Gülen kendisini ABD de tuttuğunuza sizi pişman edecek.Fakat o zaman çok geç olacak.

#HayinFETÖ
barack seni annen doguracagina gubre dokseydi en bas terorist sensin
neither is letting drug dealers with firearms charges and terrorists out of prison but it happens
@BarackObama @SenateMajLdr

Your track record is nothing to be proud of
