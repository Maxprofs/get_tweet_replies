@NeoMayanEra @leoscores19 his intentions are great but they're just intentions and not grounded in reality.
“@leoscores19: @EddieEr35 @NeoMayanEra some follow thru, some don't some kinda half ass it.. etc”
That's why it's up to #WeThePeople to ACT.
@leoscores19 @EddieEr35 I'm with you on gun control, and up the ante with #LegalizeMarijuana on a national level. 1 acre hemp = 3 acres 
.@BarackObama So we're merging the Middle and Lower classes now? Because that's the end result of your "raise the wage" policy. #EatTheRich
