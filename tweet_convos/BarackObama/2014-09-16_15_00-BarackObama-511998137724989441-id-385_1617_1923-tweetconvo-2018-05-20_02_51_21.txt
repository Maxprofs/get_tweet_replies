Here's Your Chance To Demand More Free Stuff On The Taxpayers' Dime. RT @BarackObama "The burden of student loan debt is too great."
@YerboutiSheik @BarackObama Are people finally figuring out the ROI on a masters in Pygmy Gender Identity issues sucks? #DecisionMaking
@brewmeone This generation? Nah. More likely they resent the world for not recognizing their brilliance. @BarackObama
@YerboutiSheik @BarackObama not to mention they all deserve cushy office jobs with no responsibility, 6 wks paid vacay, and full pension...
@brewmeone Remember when @BarackObama & @FLOTUS suggested ppl seek degrees in social work? #ThanksObama #ThanksMichelle
@YerboutiSheik @BarackObama @FLOTUS someone picked up their tab too... Other people's money eases a greedy socialist's "burden"
@BarackObama si nous n'agissons pas maintenant on le regrettera un jour
@BarackObama @drjackiegraham
@BarackObama Yet you spend trillions of dollars to arm #terrorists in #Syria
@BarackObama it's too high at this point are they should have longer time to pay
Of the loan
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Father of 2,Honors in all junior college classes, acceptional abilities, can not afford a 4 year college.  Give JC's the power.
@BarackObama Work! that is a four letter word that can make an affordable education!  I did!
@BarackObama Mr President please Parton my student loan
@BarackObama #OnTheRecord
@BarackObama REMEMBER> Deuteronomy 15:1..EVERY 7 years..make a Release... Every creditor that Lendeth...shall release.. the LORD's release.
@BarackObama Good night.
@BarackObama Thanks King of Jesus...
@BarackObama if u didn't have students getting liberal arts degrees that they can't use in real life, we wouldn't have this problem
@BarackObama @peterframpton As a mother of college grads, I see the burden they bear of paying back ed loans. Thanks for raising awareness

@BarackObama
@BarackObama @peterframpton U really want to do something about student loan debt? Stop states from raising tuition to pay unfunded pensions
"@BarackObama: The burden of student loan debt is too great. If you agree, go #OnTheRecord: http://ofa.bo/h0tf  "
@BarackObama
@BarackObama which country do you mean?  USA? Oh! Surprise!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Please give these students a break, they are overwhelmed in debt.

@kathydunc
@BarackObama Endlich sieht man Sie Herr Präsident wieder lächeln. Danke

@BarackObama You are the chosen one by God.  See all countries especially where you came from are safe and growing.
@BarackObama Thank you Sir for all that you are doing for your country and the world. But please remember Kenya too
@BarackObama I am Belgian MD but due to Hum. Medical aid overseas, my boy does medicine in Boston. Unbelievable difference with Belgium.
@BarackObama  Not much if use in right way
@BarackObama education should be a basic right not a huge debt!
@BarackObama its true especially in developing countried.
@BarackObama I totally agree.
@BarackObama we'll still be paying student debt, when our girls have grown!#OnTheRecord
@BarackObama let's have a productive conversation about tuition costs and the rate it has been increasing.
@BarackObama I wish you would just shut the fuck up
@BarackObama - I stand with you Mr. President!
@BarackObama @peterframpton Stop subsidizing/guaranteeing student loans; too-easy credit hyperinflated tuitions & caused huge debt loads.
@BarackObama Maybe u can have special wages for vac jobs.
@BarackObama I wish there was a way they could freeze the interest on my student loan to make on-time payments affordable.
@BarackObama Nope, I don't agree. If you want to go to college and become an adult, then you pay for the responsibility of an education.
@BarackObama terrible burden, even for those with decent jobs. we are mortgaging our kids futures.
@BarackObama 
Agree. Thx

@BarackObama #OnTheRecord
@BarackObama Buen día mi jente
@BarackObama Maybe I would if it was quality education. In class today we were learning how to add fractions. I'm in sixth grade
@barackobama really is it a burden
@BarackObama  you can't trade affordable education on others taxes!
@BarackObama hopefully student debts can be wiped out. My wife has over 100k in student loans,  but only makes 35k a year = 4 ever 2 pay off
@BarackObama. 1st education debt does not have a race & it's ignorant to classify help that way
@BarackObama yes very good education!!!
@BarackObama @truevisualpoet No doubt #OnTheRecord it is indeed, time to rein in student loan debt!
@BarackObama yes, agreed.  make all those horrible professors agree to fixed, reduced salaires!
@BarackObama the problem is there are no good paying jobs for college grads. Only service sector jobs. Thank the dems for over regulation .
@BarackObama @jeanjuniorj http://youtu.be/BjfwnBuj3O0 
@BarackObama @RhiannonKWY There might be less educational debt if more people worked their way through college.
@BarackObama show!!!
@BarackObama It takes a fool to accumulate 100k + of debt for a 20k job. Stupid is as stupid does and Barack is as stupid as they come.
@BarackObama u know barack.. maybe u shuld remind how long it took u and bill clinton to pay off their school loans @FLOTUS
@BarackObama yeah you were preaching this same shit when you first ran....
