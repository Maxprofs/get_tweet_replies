@WhiteHouse そこら辺は、マッカーサー元帥の発案した憲法９条がどんな意味を持つか、第二次冷戦を乗り切るにはどうしたらいいか考えた結果。彼の目的は世界中の憲法９条、限定数百年間の軍隊なしの地球合衆国……銀河合衆国では…と推察した結果です。
@WhiteHouse その為に…インターネットなどによるどんな権力にも従属しない世界自由報道局的組織の複合体を…その地球合衆国を造る段階で形成して行く…など…提案致します。こちらは自由に確認して下さい。では…。
@WhiteHouse なり、膨大な額の軍事費が浮けば諸問題が解決でき、さらに「ターミネーター」のように成らない、安全な発明発見の出来るスーパーコンピューターを開発して…早期に星の世界に出る。当然、それは完全に平和的に行われないといけない。また……独裁国家に成らいように。
@WhiteHouse 「アベンジャーズ」や「スタートレック・シリーズ」のフリークにトップから全ての国民までをさせる。さらに…いつでも中国・北朝鮮・イスラムの全ての国民がSOSを送れれば…とか。また…もし出来ればアメリカ合衆国一極ではなく…世界中が資本主義の地球合衆国一国に
@WhiteHouse 例えば、アメリカ合衆国が国策として行いたいことがあってもなかなか言い出しにくいこと。日本国で研究をした方が助かること。アメリカ合衆国の世界的な民主化に付いては、中国・北朝鮮に対してはインターネットを繋げることで、儲けるだけで完了が可能とか…。
@WhiteHouse 尊敬するオバマ大統領へ 日本国のアメリカ合衆国プロテスタント教会のジャンヌと申します。早稲田大学で、ビル・クリントン元大統領にキリスト教の授業をした小山宙丸早稲田大学総長の弟子の一人で、合衆国プロテスタントのグローバル化理論の研究をしています。

@kensgal3 @WhiteHouse @BarackObama You're right. Wish someone would prosecute him & his cronies, bush,cheney,etc for war crimes committed.
@tohajilee @WhiteHouse @BarackObama No the gop would rather investigate the crap out PBO for giving us healthcare but not neocons 4 war

@WhiteHouse like
@WhiteHouse part time jobs and when u work part time most jobs won't  pay insurance.  So we get a job to pay Healthcare, rent and food.
@WhiteHouse can someone explain how shutting down the Govt like the GOP wants to do helps the economy?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Congratulations for 3 lac jobs in America in November'14 which is 50%  higher than last 5 years average of 2 lac.
@WhiteHouse Yup!!! Obama Americans Didn't Build That
@WhiteHouse If you repeat this lie often enough people might start to believe it. Just like "you can keep your plan."
@WhiteHouse PART TIME/HOLIDAY JOBS DON'T COUNT @BarackObama!!!!! GAAAAWWD, YOU SUCK!
@WhiteHouse @Frangoyo CFK dice cosas parecidas y gana elecciones con el 54%,

@WhiteHouse ALL temporary for the Holiday Season! You lying Communist Bastards! These aren't permanent!
@civilwarcometh This is the best year for job growth since 1999 , that's not all temp jobs
@WhiteHouse @Frangoyo 321000 more precisely, just about the expected figure..
FACT: 
The WORST month of http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000 … under G.W.Bush
was better than the BEST month under @BarackObama!
@WhiteHouse
When @SenateDems (including @BarackObama) took Majority on 1/3/2007,
http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000 … was 63.4%
Now 59.2%
@WhiteHouse
If we had 63.4% employment now, 
11 MILLION more people would be employed!
