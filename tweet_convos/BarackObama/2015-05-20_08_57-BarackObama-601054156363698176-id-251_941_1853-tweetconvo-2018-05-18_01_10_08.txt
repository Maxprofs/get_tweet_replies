Keeps those sweet, sweet federal dollars rolling in. MT @BarackObama The best scientists in the world know that climate change is happening.
@ItsThatBriGuy @BarackObama actually if we agreed that it is happening, that would end need for research and stop federal $.
@Aftermath8 @ItsThatBriGuy @BarackObama The research has been done, you moron!... Denying it, is the main thing holding us back from action!
@LaraLuis20 The "research" has been done using an altered data set. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/globalwarming/11395516/The-fiddling-with-temperature-data-is-the-biggest-science-scandal-ever.html … @Aftermath8 @BarackObama
@ItsThatBriGuy @Aftermath8 @BarackObama Your telegraph theory is mighty stupid!
@BarackObama Mr. President,  Are you saying that those scientists who disagree with you are no good? Sort of narrow thinking don't you think
@BarackObama except 30,000 scientist who signed a petition saying otherwise. So you consider the "best scientist" those who agree with you?
