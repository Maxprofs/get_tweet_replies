@SoquelCreek @WhiteHouse Hey, I can live with that!  Bush Destroyed 10 Million Jobs during his two Recessions in 2001 & 2008!
During Bush Cheney admin more than 300,000 companies closed their doors here in #USA @threofakind @SoquelCreek @WhiteHouse
@NLuvWitUOnly @SoquelCreek @WhiteHouse Bet the TWO Bush/Chaney Recessions; can account for many (most?), of those Jobs.
@threofakind @NLuvWitUOnly I'm not a Bush fan either. He was disaster. Candidate Obama promised a better tomorrow & hasn't delivered much.
@SoquelCreek @NLuvWitUOnly Cantor, Ryan, McCarthy; met in secret early & agreed to oppose the President on his every initiative. They have!
@threofakind @NLuvWitUOnly When you ramrod ObamaCare thru on a one-party vote, you have to expect opposition.
@SoquelCreek @NLuvWitUOnly No, No, No!  The three, "Young Guns," met immediately after his FIRST Election!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Compressed natural gas can replace gasoline in normal cars - requires cannisters, hoses & a switch on the dashboard
@WhiteHouse Don't believe it? Just dig the trench. Given time & microbes - your algae *will* rot down on schedule.
@WhiteHouse You can also produce vast supplies of fertilizer, charcoal & other products w/it
@WhiteHouse  So recycle your CO2, your exhaust (CO2 & water) & decayed organics back in: an inexhaustible supply
@WhiteHouse  Algae reproduces exponentially & most are autotrophic - requiring no complex organic molecules
