@sureshkito All software can be hacked. 100% security does NOT exist. Best @POTUS spends part of $ 500.000.000 on http://firearminjuries.com/contents.php 
@madeleine @PAniskoff44 @POTUS so go ahead and disarm your security detail and save lives
@Demarco1776 not about disarming safe gun users. it's about background checks for online sales and gun shows.
@PAniskoff44 thats how it starts. the 2nd amendment is there for a reason and this administration and runaway government is that reason
@Demarco1776 so you're against background checks?  to separate responsible gun owners from criminals? b/c thats what this is
@PAniskoff44 when has a criminal ever subjected himself to a background check to get a gun? the cartels want stricter gun laws.
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS Struggle against NRA is similar to Lincoln's struggle against slavery. Change seemed impossible. But it came.
@alastairam No, our fight against NRA is simple, FUCKING VOTE. Southern lunatics were like ISIS. See http://civilwarkillers.blogspot.com/ 
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS So untrue it's not funny. These steps, like all the rest from Obama only hurt us more.

@madeleine @POTUS 66666666666
@madeleine @POTUS NO! We the people are not the President s children! We deserve a say in our government and laws. The Constitution Matters!
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS actions mean even less freedom! Keep track of numbers! No change coming!
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS LMAO! OK, IF YOU SAY SO.

@madeleine Oh yeah, his "steps" will do absolutely nothing to protect communities or strengthen the country. Empty pandering is all.

@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS omg so glad you're putting Ian "H" Watkins to works but did you have to outsource??
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS No one cares, Maddy.
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS Ever hear of "due process"? Disregarding 2 foundational principles of our country in one day...not impressed.
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS

It's really not the presidents job to get involved in the gun issue.
He should stick to issues tasked to him
@madeleine @POTUS How exactly does it strengthen security?
@madeleine @BarackObama TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO'S WERE INVOLVED MASS KILLINGS? CAN BE HELPFUL,IN STOPPING THESE MASS SHOOTING,IT WON'T HURT.
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS 
Notice that most of the gun violence is where the gun laws are the strictest.
Detroit,Chicago.
@madeleine @POTUS Much too little and much too late, as an armed camp with heavy weapons and large magazines awaits the coming slaughter  
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS 
Don't blame the guns....it's the criminal mindset that is the problem.
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS 
More laws will not stop gun violence.
The problem is a mental health issue and not more laws.
@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS remember law abiding gun owners are not the problem hmmmm. This won't stop the thugs  ....problem NOT solved
@madeleine @POTUS

@madeleine @BarackObama @POTUS 2nd Amendment was written to ward off foes, primarily those who would ignore the Constitution.
