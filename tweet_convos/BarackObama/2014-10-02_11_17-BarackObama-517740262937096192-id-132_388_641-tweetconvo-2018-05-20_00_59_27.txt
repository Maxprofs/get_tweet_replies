@BarackObama Obama no  men naice
@BarackObama What leadership ? The kind of leadership that kills the citizens of #Kobane ? This is gruesome !! #SaveKobani
@BarackObama #WorldIsBiggerThan5 bro...
@BarackObama How can any American hear about the daily atrocities over there and not feel some degree of shame for not acting decisively.
@BarackObama all historical analysis and partisan political rhetoric aside! Fact: children! mothers, fathers dead. Whole families destroyed!
@BarackObama I am 61 year old apolitical man. I have always had faith in my government and my president to do the right thing for the nation
@BarackObama I accept the notion that sometimes military force is needed to solve a politically unsolvable problem in our world.
@BarackObama I believe to be an American is to hold human rights, human dignity and human life above all else no matter what.
@BarackObama I believe America used to stand for hope to many throughout this world.
@BarackObama #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama Yes sir!!
@BarackObama Euhhh ? An American leader ??? You mean Indonesian trouble maker and big liar ! #pokerface
@barackobama .i think the leadership is quite favourable 2 de ameriks ,so keep it up%
@BarackObama  Only Americans Say they are leaders but never bother to see if really the World is Following them..
@SHAHSUDH @BarackObama 
Brilliant and true
@BarackObama BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS! IF WE LEAD THE WORLD WILL FOLLOW. BECAUSE: IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO!
@BarackObama America can stop this terrible thing happening today in the Middle East. Yes, Americans will willingly go into harms way. Why?
@BarackObama global politics do not matter! Coalitions do not matter! The only thing that matters is saving innocent lives.
@BarackObama The loss of innocent human life in the Mid.East is heart breaking! And I can't shake the feeling that my gov't doesn't care.
@BarackObama I confess that lately I have begun to wonder if my gov't has lost its moral compass In dealing with the human crisis in M-east
@BarackObama I believe that the preservation of human life,no matter where it exists in this world must be a moral imperative for our nation
@BarackObama I believe domestic issues in our nation need work and to your credit you are certainly working hard to address these issues.
@BarackObama humility is not his forte looks like when he says the leadership is constant in uncertain world. Who made it uncertain anyway
@BarackObama corruption is so bad in America. And you know it.
@BarackObama what about the Queen?
@BarackObama 113.

@BarackObama Nonsense... I can think of a few "Presidencies" that have eroded that "constant". And, yours IS one of the most erosive...
@BarackObama You wouldn't recognize leadership if it smacked you upside your head.
@BarackObama When world changing constantly how policy can remain unchanged living always in the past present change with twinkling of eye
@BarackObama thought the sun rising was a bit consistent 
@BarackObama hıhı sen öyle sen aq
