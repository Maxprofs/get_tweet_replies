.@WhiteHouse "Thanks for killing indigenous people across the Globe. Just like we did to the indigenous people of this great nation."
@garethicke @WhiteHouse just like the indigenous people did between tribes before we or anyone else got here
@AParra210 @WhiteHouse that's ok then. Murder away young man.
@garethicke @WhiteHouse I'm also sure that it's okay for Palestine to murder Jews & try to dominate the region right? Evil usa! Evil Israel!
@AParra210 @WhiteHouse Palestine trying to dominate the region? Jesus wept. Bed time for you I think.
@garethicke @WhiteHouse I think not. Muslims are a virus with no tolerance for any others in "their" lands. Blame the UN if u know history
@AParra210 @WhiteHouse the UN? The same UN formed 28 years after the Balfour declaration? Mmm.
@garethicke Jews have been there 4 1000s of years, just like Arabs. The problem is, Muslims want to eradicate Jews. Nothing 2 do w/land
@WhiteHouse 

nice its on part óf the president
His words don't match his actions. He is the CINC. Why was he not in Afghanistan? @WhiteHouse @BarackObama #TCOT
He was busy eating Thanksgiving dinner and golfing, Duh. @2009superglide @WhiteHouse @BarackObama
He doesn't exactly lead by example does he? @PolitiBunny @WhiteHouse @BarackObama #TCOT
@2009superglide @PolitiBunny @WhiteHouse @BarackObama Well his aides do sometimes force him to wear that cool "look I care" bomber jacket.
Wearing a bomber jacket makes him a CINC as much as wearing a tutu makes him a ballerina @attyrik @PolitiBunny @WhiteHouse @BarackObama
Thanks for your service ---> @2009superglide @PolitiBunny @WhiteHouse @BarackObama The way he throws a baseball he looks better in a tutu.
@WhiteHouse I'm so sure. He's probably on with Jarrett laughing about the "stupid American voter" he relies on. Fucking snake.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama. We know when you lie, your lips move

@WhiteHouse @NickdeSemlyen An Intiative of Eye Screening has now become a Drive.Completed 10k+ thanks @tceye  team
@WhiteHouse @realmrmom Looks like Obama is making a `bro-mance` call to Reggie Love. Hardly looks like a Commander-In-Chief to military call

@WhiteHouse Gee, did he call those troops that received pink slips on the battle field?
@WhiteHouse You talking to Jake from Allstate?
@WhiteHouse Why is it that Obama always has to tweet out a picture of himself?  Why not tweet out a picture of a soldier?  Narcissist.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 미국의 산업스파이에 대해서는 어떤 수사를 하나요. 기업이 흔들리는 것은 지나친 급여의 문제가 아닌지 걱정입니다. 기업간의 스파이 활동은 훈련보다는 개인(사람들의)의 감정적 싸움이 될 수도 있다고 생각 합니다
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama NICE
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I like that photo.
