You are missed as well.By all of America .
Please come back, @BarackObama. The world needs a hero like you to fight the current WH villains.
Barack was shit on for 8 years by an ungrateful nation. Not his job to come back.
yes but not by us who r wishing he could come back we wished he never left
Sorry, Barack is getting his vacay on and well-deserved if you ask me
Despite Obama having deserved time off, Trump's still outdoing him on holiday time!
.@BarackObama I miss a president who respects artists
I miss a president that respects humanity.
I miss a President who's a grownup
I miss respecting our president!
I miss a president who can spell & won't willingly start world wars.
Suing sitting POTUS for defamation might be beneath the office of your office, Mr President. But, I wish he'd pay for his lies
"beneath the *dignity of your office..."
Miss that EDIT button.
I think these lies are grounds for impeachment and also a good lawsuit
How much is the Obama name worth?  More than the Trumps have ever seen.
Indeed. Never thought of it that way. 
rip
that is so mean and uncalled for.
for saying "Rest in Peace" to Chuck Berry?
don't think she was being mean?
if you read the tweet w/o context, looks like "President Obama rest in peace".
if people stick 2 the topic  They w/n who she was taking about
Agreed, Ray...you have to read tweets with context...
I said I'm sorry, thought she meant Barack Obama #Peace 
Baby killing war monger.
Are you serious? Libya, Yemen and Syrian children would say otherwise. Deluded.
. Didn't we just bomb Yemen - like a month ago.  Now we have troops on the ground in Syria?  Ok
Ya you had  8 years of bombing Yemen under Barack, armed Al-Qaeda and screwed Libya
Not defending trump but Barack is a war criminal
You've never served in the military - have you?
love how you just brush off his crime's, You are all deluded, No wonder that dope trump won.
And we miss you!! Obama/Biden 2020???? 
At this point, screw the 22nd Amendment! 
RIP Chuck!! I miss you Obama!!! Just wanted to tell you that. 
we ALL miss Obama...even us Canadians.
I would say the world misses the Obamas.
hell yea..
can you come back. PLEASE!!!

pretty please with sugar on top
America and the world miss you man. Please come back.
I TRUST that you and Michelle are working hard to stop gerrymandering, stop election fraud, & recruit loud great
I hope you're just enjoying a break from all the very difficult decisions and hard work you did.
and such hard work to double the national debt.
Do you believe EVERY lie you hear? Or just the ones Trump tells?
I appreciated your service to our country everyday as president and now miss you and your service every single day.
remember when we never had to think "I wonder how the president will embarrass us today?" 8 solid years of pride
Yes. Now we know 45 will be an embarrassment - we just don't know on a scale of 1 to 10 - what the number will be.
11

and I'm Canadian!
Ditto and I am in the UK! stop having fun and get back to being world leader!

With all due respect, Mr. President, to you and Mr. Berry, he didn't roll over this Queen 
.@BarackObama 
1/ suppose a Chuck Berry tribute is as appropriate a place to write this, because I usually listened to at least few of his
.@BarackObama 
2/songs during flights.The other day, my daughter wanted to discuss a pastime we both miss greatly but will opt out of during
.@BarackObama 
3/the current political climate. There are 2 approaches to the main airport where I live, & - goes approximately & at times
.@BarackObama 
4/directly over my little house. Whenever you or you & your family flew in, we would listen to ATC/AF1 cptn communication.
.@BarackObama 
5/Fell asleep b4 finished feel-gd memory of you: oddly, we never say your AF1 entourage (always when other flight path used),
.@BarackObama 
6/depite having seen GWB's sev. times w/o any electronic assistance to locate.  But it was always a treat/bonding experience,
.@BarackObama 
7/exciting for her (& me) when heard ATC/AF1 transmissions. Trivial memory, but amazing how it now seem impossibly beautiful.
.@BarackObama 
8/But it isn't "impossibly" beautiful b/c We the People follow your most important lesson: in face of tyranny, never give up.
