@WhiteHouse Resorting to corporate-style lies to pimp corporate-style deal that gives corporate everything it wants. SO disappointed by you.
@WhiteHouse One way to eliminate illegal environmental spoliation is to legalize it.
@WhiteHouse this is a ruse to get the crap trhu
@sueday1970 @WhiteHouse It's a bold face lie. Environmentalists HATE this deal!! Stop lying to the people @POTUS
@devinhardin6 @WhiteHouse @POTUS did you read my posts?
@sueday1970 I have seen your name in RTs a lot and like what you have to say, so I started following. #feelthebern
@WhiteHouse I can't believe that a Democratic president is shoving this corporate
carte blanche down our throats! 'Nuff said.
@WhiteHouse I'm confused  Is the TPP an outright act of Treason?  Or should it be called sedition?  Or just the exact opposite of Democracy?
@WhiteHouse cool! Can I read that secret shit when your done...hello...hello,is this thing on?!
@WhiteHouse transparent my butt
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama God bless you!!! I'll share it!!!
@WhiteHouse So how many more American JOB losses does that add up to???  #SaveAFishLooseAJob
@terrimore1  its ILLEGAL fishing! A life is worth more than a job. And sharks are fucking awesome!
@Reese_Norton So why do they kill themLEGALLY for medicines?? A sharks life, I DONT THINK SO!!
@terrimore1 you probably wouldn't even care if sharks went extinct now would you?
@Reese_Norton I swam w sharks, dolphins, manatees.  I luv all animals!!!!!
@terrimore1 yet you think somebody's job is worth an animals entire species?! Clearly your logic is very screwed up.
@Reese_Norton YES. I care more about humans than wildlife.
@terrimore1 well? are you saying shark finners are innocent? Because it sure sounds like it. #AnswerYouTwat

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why can't we see the TPP?  Is it true that it does away with child labor laws?  AWFUL!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Corporations can sue countries for profits unrealized. Enviro law can result in profit loss. Corporations win.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how about illegal occupation of a WH? illegal usage of hypnosis on voters? not providing real Birth Certificate?
@whitehouse from Texas ,we love President BO!!!
@WhiteHouse yes I know that
@WhiteHouse Really? Which environmentalists? Koch brothers? C'mon, we're not all completely stupid! #StopTheTPP
@WhiteHouse how can you even stick a made in america under that.  Everyone knows this ships jobs to Vietnam.  Your downright lying. #outrage
@WhiteHouse I'm sure your corporate masters are pleased as can be. Everyone else? Not so much.
@WhiteHouse I sincerely hope @POTUS  takes responsibility for that hospital bombing. Do the right thing mr.president!
@WhiteHouse Sold out again.  Shameful this will be added to what was a solid legacy.
@WhiteHouse How about letting the public read TPP and let us decide if it's so amazing...?
@WhiteHouse I've usually got a lot of love for our chief exec. Dude...this one you boned.
@WhiteHouse This treaty will send more jobs overseas, raise prescription drug prices and is a sell out to large multinational corporations.
@WhiteHouse  #Illegal poaching and indiscriminate encroachment ought to have found its  due place place.Pity it has missed its place
@WhiteHouse TPP is not a trade deal.  It is a way to accomplish that which could not be accomplished through the normal legislative process.
@WhiteHouse The TPP is Obama's final gift for his sponsors who bought him the presidency.  Do not let this abomination pass.
@WhiteHouse If #TPP is so great why is it such a secret? Behind closed doors by the same people that brought us the Great Recession of 2008.
@WhiteHouse: "Environmentalists praise wildlife measures in Trans-Pacific trade pact" → http://nyti.ms/1Q0NngA  #TPP
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Japan is not your colony! Japanese stupid negotiators can calculate customs ?

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Hello Mr. Tiger.By all means, please listen to my song. https://youtu.be/v3qXAsVuGAA 
@WhiteHouse thanks for the great steaming pile of lies. WWF is neither an animal rights nor an environmental group. #Impeachment
@WhiteHouse Ignorance is Strength
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama C'est bien de vouloir sauver l'écosystème, mais avec la croissance démographique humaine c'est pire que les criquet
@WhiteHouse please stop your corporate propaganda for the #TPP. #ReleasetheText #FlushTheTPP
@WhiteHouse the #TPP is anti-American, end of story #NoTPP
@WhiteHouse Environmentalists are not praising the TPP, we actively oppose it. This is a downright lie.  Very bad Obama.  #disappointed
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama How about banning all ivory in the United States instead of wasting your time on the weather?
@WhiteHouse I only have one thing to say leave them alone they are called wild from a reason
@WhiteHouse Show us TPP text!  What envtl enforcement?  If it's so strong, why not give us details?  If built on the NAFTA model, NOT GOOD
@WhiteHouse the federal government has no authority to govern state land and can't own land within a state.
@WhiteHouse BEAUTIFUL! TO THE THE PRESIDENT(POTUS); GOOD WORK!
@WhiteHouse *Facepalm* Let the public read it before ratifying it. We'll be the judge of if it's really as good as you say.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Not so fast folks 1 enviro grp is cited & doesn't address dozens of other enviro issues i.e. GMO labels, extraction
.@WhiteHouse no we don't, but now that its signed do we the public get to read it or is it still a secret
@WhiteHouse Maybe congress will be outsourced instead of American jobs #screwTPP
@WhiteHouse Hard to decide between best I will get, what I want, and what horrifies me. Grateful. *Honest* Elections would choose best path.
@WhiteHouse  Go to hell
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama good Obama plz don't let them kill the tiger that attack his keeper the tiger is wild he new that
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What an example!
@WhiteHouse 
Здравствуйте уважаемые.
@WhiteHouse Surely committed to so, President, for make America the democratic country it is and we would mantain claudio alpaca
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that is nice and all but what about jobs how r u going to fix that
@WhiteHouse Thank you for taking care of our beautiful animals, trees & sea creatures.
@WhiteHouse Not buying it. There is only one reason a party, which opposes everything good for America, would overwhelmingly support this.
@WhiteHouse .@POTUS heartbreaking lie. I don't envy coming feedback from our citizens, scientists, local and global. Never mind #DeathCounts
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Building the economies of other nations, at the expense of our own. Show me it's not so.
@WhiteHouse Why is it so secret if it's so "wonderful." Can you name the environmentalists who are praising the TPP?
@WhiteHouse If the White House is so confident in this agreement, they should release the full text. No more secrets. Release the text. #TPP
@WhiteHouse Seriously?  How misleading ur statements r.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Thank you for facing a serious problem &bringing it to the tableEvery animal deserves a free life #strongerpenaltiesforpoaching
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama say good bye to jobs
@WhiteHouse it doesn't matter if you go forward or backwards, people will still have something negative to say.
@whitehouse its right envornment keeping measurements
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama sir at the last only kindness matters !
@WhiteHouse I don't buy this for a second. Release the text! #StopTPP #NoTPP
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama How did they get their hands on the details of a secret pact?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Help the wild horses, and grouse in our country, too.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Environmentalists?
@WhiteHouse #TPP You hate America, Americans, and every good thing this country ever stood for. May you live 1000 years to witness alluruind
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Mr President  dont forget Libya  please
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama YES!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Alas! Pakistan and India think about it.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Amerika için yolun sonu görünüyor.Amerika yaman hayata az kaldı.
Irony of @WhiteHouse using this image for #TPP is that trade agreements are trying to stop the #MadeInAmerica saying.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama more like coporate/investor agreement no trade agreement it bunch of bull shit cock dickie lies by anti americans
@WhiteHouse congrats on sealing  the TPP agreement by the way
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama true welldone mr president#
@WhiteHouse @ animals are amazing.
@WhiteHouse This is the height of cynicism.  Nothing good can come of something you have to keep secret from us.
@WhiteHouse 
@WhiteHouse We have to stop #ACD or there will be nothing to poach. Thanks to #TPP more people will need to poach to make ends meet.
“@WhiteHouse: "Environmentalists praise wildlife measures in Trans-Pacific trade pact" http://nyti.ms/1Q0NngA  #TPP ”
@WhiteHouse If your "environmental measures" are so great, why is @sierraclub & other environmental groups against it?  #NoTPP #TPP
@WhiteHouse In fact the deal goes far beyond dodgy2 taking away our rights as humans. A positive claim such as this is purely 2try& cover up
@WhiteHouse  Once TTP goes thru U R then free2 do whatever U like without opposition & every1 knows this deal is dodgy & Politicians lie!.
@WhiteHouse thank you!!!!!
@WhiteHouse Boy this tweet sure didn't engage its audience as intended, did it? Almost like people want a say in their nation's direction...
@DougBierend @WhiteHouse haha yea, tweet anti environment objective as good and your going to get ire from us
@WhiteHouse traitors! Bernie Sanders2016
@WhiteHouse cares more about wildlife then they do about all the BABBIES KILLED by Pland Peranthood.. Obama just quit . Let Ted Cruze in W.H
@WhiteHouse Yall are full of shit if you actually believe that. How does an increase in industrialization help the environment in any way?
@WhiteHouse if the pact is so incredible why not release the contents of the pact to the people rather than negotiate in secret.
@WhiteHouse I'll take "stuff to distract from other stuff" for $1000 Alex
@glaity @WhiteHouse In this case the TPP is what we are supposed to be distracted from.  Quick burn a flag #Obama needs a distraction!
@WhiteHouse meanwhile making it illegal for democracies to go any further w/ environmental/labor protections
@WhiteHouse: Dude! This is a BOGUS deal. Not good for people or the planet. Check this video:
@WhiteHouse I like how you attempt to sway public opinion before anyone knows what's really in your shady agreement. You're all corrupt.
@WhiteHouse just not illegal people
@WhiteHouse Hillary Clinton "TPP will allow Americans with Cancer & LGBT disease to choose .....High Drug Cost or Death by Dying"
@WhiteHouse you need to check your gun habits before you attack our pistols. Your just un-arming good citizens, not the terrorists you made!
@WhiteHouse About FKN time. Good work !!
@WhiteHouse congrats on sealing the TPP agreement by the way
@WhiteHouse I think @BarackObama is one of the greatest American president ever esp cos of his progressiveness
@WhiteHouse ???? What about the ATTACK On environmental regulations?? #StopTPP @FlushtheTPP
@WhiteHouse It just went live, crediting you, on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1HOguA6 
@WhiteHouse Why haven't the people had a chance to review it before you decided to agree to it? You forget who you work for?
@WhiteHouse Please tell us how many people will die because you've extended medical patents and limited generics and they can't afford them?
@WhiteHouse When does the deal go public. We have 60 days to review.
@WhiteHouse You left out the part where coal companies can sue under ISDS provisions for profit losses. What a complete sell out like usual

#TPP #TISA & #TTIP agreements are massive Corporate power grabs dressed up as trade deals http://ian56.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-ttp-tisa-and-ttip-in-europe.html … 
@WhiteHouse https://larouchepac.com/20150730/stop-world-war-iii-hillary-must-expose-obamas-benghazi-lies …
@WhiteHouse how about combating Big Business instead.
@WhiteHouse Maybe you should release the text so the public can read it if it's so amazing
