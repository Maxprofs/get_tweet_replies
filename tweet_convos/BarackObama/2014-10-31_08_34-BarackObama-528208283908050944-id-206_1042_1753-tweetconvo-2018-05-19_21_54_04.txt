@BarackObama That doesn’t include the 12 million who left the workforce though
@AddictionMan25 @BarackObama It never has been measured with it.  Also, look at the birth rate chart. Coincidence?
@mattvorwald @BarackObama True, but we’re about 6 million short of expected people out of the labor force still http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2013/10/14/both_sides_stretch_the_truth_about_obama_labor_market_100665.html …
@AddictionMan25 @BarackObama assuredly there have been people that stopped looking.  However, that's no different than under past presidents
@mattvorwald @BarackObama "we would expect about 7.1 million of our 11 million... the labor force increased by only 1.3”
