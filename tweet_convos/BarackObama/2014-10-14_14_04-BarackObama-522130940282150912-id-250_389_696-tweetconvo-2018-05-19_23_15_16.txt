@BarackObama (´へωへ`*)
@BarackObama @SafaiePost Ebola is in the USA and need to stop it on its track. Cannot afford to let it spread.
@BarackObama @safaiepost President should take stronger stand on Climate Change. ISIS is not national threat, Climate Change is.

@BarackObama -> Barack's translation: Don't "F"with his love/ Miss Bean the future Mrs. D. Obama, Next!
@BarackObama
it is useful to remember that cutting carbon pollution is impossibile with shooting & blasting & fireing in Ukraine
@BarackObama wondering if the president can step in on the Ebola that we have stuck in port arthur we have enough issues down
@BarackObama ->Let's NOT forget co-conspirators of FLOTUS & the EPA's Brad and Sherri Bradley who's also responsible 4 my son Will's death.+
@BarackObama ->How is it that both Brad & Sherri Bradley (Will's uncle & aunt) were able 2 work decades 4 the government w/o a PE license!?+
@BarackObama ->A, P.E license is a Professional Engineers license. Guess they couldn't make the grade,but got a job in government anyways!-+
.@BarackObama 

You could cut carbon pollution by not flying to fundraisers every week.

.
@BarackObama You seem to blame that on the coal industry. Do you ever except responsibility for anything?
.@BarackObama I'm going 2 take a stand 4 any HealthCare worker who refuses to deal with anyone who has #Ebola w/o proper safeguards&training
.@BarackObama They didn't sign up for this. If you disagree get your ass in there and take their place.
Thanks for reminding to burn the trash after I finish gassing up my pickup truck. Cutting back on flying AF1 any?@BarackObama @OFA
@BarackObama wouldn`t hurt if you do.
@BarackObama Any gains will be obliterated by China and India. Do you intend to declare war on these nations? #Election2014 #propaganda
@BarackObama It is equally urgent if not more to clean up and to put the tools away in the north pole.
@BarackObama @OFA please dismantle the EPA!!!
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama Obama the "Job Killa" !
@BarackObama Frigg the climate what about them lunatics chopping heads off #isis crisis

@BarackObama carbon pollution should be the last thing on your mind with Ebola and Isis going around! You moron!
@BarackObama please give deep dicount on electric vehicles
@BarackObama @OFA I think you should be more concerned about halting the spread of Ebola not enough is being done.
@BarackObama @OFA i love you Barack Obama 
@BarackObama The ozone layer hurt all human beings and human pests but are more dangerous than anything else
@BarackObama Fear causes me to my kids horror, but life has taught me that I made much of the same
@BarackObama -> Let's NOT forget Senior sperm donor Ron "Paul" Bradley (grandfather) all who had a hand in training Will to be a terrorist.+
@BarackObama -> Ron &Paul Bradley planned from the moment Will was born on 10-10-93 2 kill me.Lorne Michael of SNL called em Unibombers.+
@BarackObama -> The press referred to my sons as the Menedez Bros. that killed me.  And Paul Bradley as O.J Simpson: Hindsight's 20/20 . +
@BarackObama no more war just extend the unemployment benefits ASAP
@BarackObama what will take for you to have a meaningful stand on any of the day's most pressing issues?  All of this shit is contrived...
@BarackObama I worked there is the reason I know how the process works sir. I like your stance on cleaner air have a great day Mr. President
@BarackObama como vai Presidente ??
@BarackObama ->  What's appropriate 4 my son, whom they turned N2 a terrorist is appropriate 4 FLOTUS & his sperm donor Paul "Rand"Bradley.+
@BarackObama worry about those who cut necks and legs in syria and iraq. Not long time 2 come to your home, clown
@BarackObama I would think that it would be more important at this point to take a stand against ISIS and Ebola but that's just me
@BarackObama 

شكراً لك صديقك هاوي من السعودية
@BarackObama Sat thru Sun yes it burns coal ;however, Mon thru Fri it burns the city`s thrash I feel the scrubbers  are inadequate for that.
@BarackObama nuts
@BarackObama Mon thru Fri they burn all the trash in the city at the plant. I am almost positive the plant is incable of cleaning the air.
@BarackObama It is not only meaningful stand but also honorable stance for the benefit of humanity and the nature against traitors..!
@BarackObama just make sure that your fully aware of the real # of jobs your really going to affect when you try to shut down KY Coal.
@BarackObama why are people being so mean to the American president? I don't get it. I think he's awesome!!!

@BarackObama I love u
@BarackObama If you are really excited about this sir then discountiuing the McIntosh Plant in Lakeland FL is a great idea effective today:)
