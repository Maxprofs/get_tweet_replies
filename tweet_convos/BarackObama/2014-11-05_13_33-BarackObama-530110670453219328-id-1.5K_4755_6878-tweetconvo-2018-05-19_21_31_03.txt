@BarackObama good luck with these terrorists taking control of the house and senate
@NickZele @BarackObama Hey Nick why don't you take a look at the terrorist that are destroying our Constitution! Idiot
@ejabel2 lol please don't say you love God in your bio when you are a hypocritical conservatard bent on destroying America
Sorry you took such a beating this election @NickZele
@Eagle_Vision what's it like to lose 2 presidential elections to your "best" candidates? It's even funnier when Hilary wins in 2016
Oh yeah, Hillary was a real asset @NickZele
@Eagle_Vision not her fault they lost. She's going to win, and you know it. You cry yourself to sleep just thinking about it.
@NickZele @Eagle_Vision If she wins it proves the liberal voters think of party above country. That should make us all cry. #Hillaryisafraud
@BarackObama maybe focus on your own country.
@esther_305 @BarackObama I don't think Barack can help kenya
@davidlehmann09 @BarackObama whoa. That was tasteless.
@esther_305 @BarackObama I would respectfully disagree.
@davidlehmann09 I beg to differ.
@esther_305 That's cool.  Our country was built on the ability to disagree with others and our government.
@davidlehmann09 apparently the leaders of your country think that this should be forced upon the rest of the world. That worries me.
@esther_305 Free speech worries you??
@BarackObama then you need to be humble and work with the new majority reform taxes, trade, immigration, and the ACA. No unilateral moves
@BobbieMitchell @BarackObama screw that they didn't work with our majority. BTW he did work with them & conceded much at his own risk.
@matmounce @BarackObama they weren't allowed to work with the majority. When did he work with them????
@BobbieMitchell @BarackObama weren't allowed? From the start he tried to compromise with them but they wanted it their way or nothing.
@matmounce @BarackObama Wow revisionist history? No amendments to bills. The "we won" statement. Yep he worked with them all the time. lol
@BobbieMitchell @BarackObama he did win based on his platform and yet he gave up some of it for the purpose of progress.
@matmounce @BarackObama no he gave up his agenda because he spent all his "mandate" on a failed health care law. Thats irrefutable
@BobbieMitchell @BarackObama yeah it's failed. So not true and you need to look at facts. And I am calling this a wrap.
