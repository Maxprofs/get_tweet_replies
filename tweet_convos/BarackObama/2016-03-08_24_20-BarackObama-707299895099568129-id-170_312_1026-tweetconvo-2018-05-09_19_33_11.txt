@BarackObama @VP if you wanna make credible argument, don't bring a biased opinion into it. At least try to find a non-interested 3rd party.

@BarackObama @VP I'll just leave this here
Sen. Joe Biden in 1992 says President Bush should "not name a nominee until after the November election..." #SCOTUS
@BarackObama @VP If you exhibited acts of bipartisanship like attending funeral of Scalia/Nancy Reagan you might get some respect in return.
@BarackObama @VP He spoke to congress saying the exact opposite during GHB Presidency. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/joe-biden-argued-for-delaying-supreme-court-picks-in-1992.html …
@BarackObama @VP @nytimes Yes Mr. President and Mr. Vice President the Senate should do their duty as they know they should.
@BarackObama @VP @nytimes you acting blind, self interest that's the only thing that drives the NAZI party. Wake up. "REAL TALK"
@BarackObama @VP @nytimes too bad he is wrong.  The "advice" of the Senate is not to give consent.  Pretty simple and justified.
@BarackObama @VP listen to what he said when he was a senator,he speaks with forked tongue,or bs disease
@BarackObama @VP @nytimes Oh how the tides have turned?? What's good for the goose is good for the gander!! FLIP FLOP!!
@BarackObama @VP @DavidWalenski it will come back to haunt them,especially Mitch McConnell,ex-coal miners defender on his vote.

@BarackObama @VP Tomorrow is your day, wake up!
@BarackObama @VP @nytimes #practicewhatyoupreach
@BarackObama @VP If the Senate does hold hearings and votes no, we will see op-ed pieces from you defending their right to do so, right?
@BarackObama @VP I'll be your justice
