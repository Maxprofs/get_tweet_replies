@BarackObama thank you for taking on this difficult issue. Support you 100%
@BarackObama if u want to stop gun violence stop trying to take people's guns away
@BarackObama @areyou0 #NRA #TeaParty Gun Logic EXPLAINED? (Video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIP7EOR-638 … #Veterans #UniteBlue
@BarackObama When that is kinda already to be seen as something that has got to be realized and very good;
@BarackObama And clearly: President MANIPULATED into taking on the weapon industry and ALONE.
@BarackObama Only in the US and no where else; The words say it clearly. Because that is part of a larger plan;
@BarackObama Gun laws = prevent a few of those shootings but not all;
The real solution means solve them ALL.
@BarackObama And when really know and understand how and what there is behind.Then there comes logic,sense and understanding on that problem
@BarackObama Gun laws have kinda nothing to do with those shootings and blood baths.The words where even said: why only in the US, not else.
@BarackObama taking guns away helps in no form. You think taking guns away for protection is going to help keep people save Stfu
@BarackObama Pass this pic on to our troops. I'm sure they need something to keep up M.R.
@BarackObama As far as keeping our nation safe one more day...Thank you, and tell 'em thanks.
@BarackObama Good evening, Sir, from California. Put in a good word for us to the pope? He knows someone who helped us with the drought:) E.
@BarackObama due to having a "mental illness". Hmm mm..... Shouldn't we continue to think on this.... Ya think?!
@BarackObama mental illness affects a vast anount of Americans. So, in effect, u can eliminate a good chunk by simply labeling them as unfit
@BarackObama if I were taking med &, in many yrs of taking med, never caused harm, how can u label me unfit to protect myself with a gun?
@BarackObama the 2nd Amendment was written to protect my right as an American citizen to protect myself. No prez has right to take it away.
@BarackObama won't help you dismantle the Constitution
@BarackObama Don't allow anybody to have guns. That would end all possibility of their misuse. Knives and knuckledusters also.
@BarackObama We do have to accept a GENOCIDE as a price of freedom and our economy #topple_assad
@BarackObama ExactlyThat is why #TOPPLE_ASSAD crimes against humanity are crimes against the free world.
@BarackObama This is right initiative Mr. Obama.
@BarackObama just tell us what your real agenda is #americanrightsmatter. #terrorist #armamerica
@BarackObama It's about time someone stood up to the gun lobby. Bravo President Obama #guncontrol
@BarackObama no guns, you Americans should be ashamed following an outdated constitution that is meaningless
@BarackObama i wana see u
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Hello!
My name is Việt. I come from Vietnam. My brain being controlled by satellite. Please give me freedom.

@BarackObama Mr. Obama if u want reduce 5%impotency then start pen war against gun war.#world war free zone.#yes we can build it.
@BarackObama @BrandonJRouth hey guess what Obama... U SUCK
@BarackObama You do accept the carnage--you promote and fund the mass murder of children. Like all Marxists--you want the people disarmed.
@BarackObama KILLER
@BarackObama Excellent that something is being done! Right to bear arms.. pistols are arms. No one needs machine guns or assault rifles.
@BarackObama very nice smile both of you.
@BarackObama :I hope mass murder doesn't become inevitably normal. But entrenched attitudes must change.
@BarackObama Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.
@andrewevansus @BarackObama Nice.
Make that up yourself, did ya?
@BarackObama join the fight
@BarackObama They will still obtain weapons and arm themselves illegally! All you're doing is making it more difficult to protect ourselves
@BarackObama what good will stricter gun laws do against criminals and terrorists that intend to do Americans harm?
@BarackObama I'm very proud of you Mr. President! Thank you! 
@BarackObama
@BarackObama The people living in the most vulnerable neighbourhoods should be given pullet proof vests to protect themselves!
@BarackObama : you have my support when it comes to gun laws..
@BarackObama @BrandonJRouth I totally agree!
@BarackObama what cop out traitor you are. We laugh at you. You've done a lot of damage but don't worry, we'll erase what you've done soon!
@BarackObama @POTUS still working hard to keep us safe.
@BarackObama  Mr.President,try using the phrase"Second Amendment collateral damage" to describe the gun carnage.
@BarackObama you're going to take away the very rights that we need to protect ourselves.. Its like you want us to get massacred
Barack Obamaさん

join the fight to help Stop ◯◯ Violence

Thank you very much!!

@BarackObama  #StopGunViolence
@BarackObama

@BarackObama U need to learn from India for Stopping of Gun violence...
@BarackObama Sir I Shocked to see this post...In my country India if I have an Knife with me without any License I would be jail fr 3 month.
@BarackObama @BrandonJRouth How about enforce the laws we already have? Stop giving repeat firearm offenders a free pass for testimony.
@BarackObama continuez me le président.
@BarackObama @BrandonJRouth our Prime Minister 'just did it' why can't the 'most powerful man in the world' just 'do it'?
@BarackObama I'm with you, but quoting your own quote seems a bit gauche.
@BarackObama @fxnopinion @frankminiter @cnbc @CBSNews @npr @NewsHour @abcnews Only @gop who have  been shot understand the devastation.
@BarackObama dear Americans. You don't need private guns. The police handles that. Regards, Holland. #StopGunViolence
Yeah, because the cops can totally be everywhere to stop every rape, home invasion etc 24/7. #Derp @micheltie
@Temp15544 in my country it has worked for hundreds of years. Maybe it isnt in our nature?
This isn't Holland. If I wanted to be fucked by statism further, I'd have moved there. Liberty > feelings. @micheltie
@Temp15544 we are equal to your democratic sistem. Forbid guns, you prevent a great number of accidents/murders. Guns equal agression.
Less than 1% of our population are murdered by guns. We're not democratic, so my liberty isn't subject to the majority. @micheltie
@Temp15544 Lets just say i don't think its a great idea to allow everybody to be able to shoot everybody.
Americans agree. Not just anyone can get a gun. Why have an opinion on something you know nothing about? @micheltie
@BarackObama FREEDOM wont come til we are reminded that WE ARE ALL ONE and nobody should exalt themselves or they will be humbled.
@BarackObama
@barackobama @obamaonly1 sir I want to join the US millitary to fight against the terrorist please all I need is a chance
@BarackObama I have a question. Its your last year and you are pushing harder than ever to disarm the America,  what is your end game?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama it's not the new norm. you libtards are just feeding your sheep that bullshit.
@BarackObama Why everyone upset it's good he did this it's like you guys act like he passed something bad. Stop woth hbe nonsense.

@BarackObama I feel the same. Violence like these will not be the end.
@BarackObama sei il piu forte ciao
@BarackObama 
People willing to sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither.

Go back to whining about refugees and stop using the dead.

@BarackObama Jared Loughner passed a background check.
@BarackObama Thanks for your fight versus weapons. A French guy. The massacre must end.
@BarackObama It is not the new normal it is the old normal.  People have alway killed people.
@BarackObama  If we must have pistols and rifles, whatever! But no civilian needs weapons meant only for war! Militia is for war.
@BarackObama remember the gay dentist who used his hiv infected blood to kill? It isn't the weapon but hatred that must be distinguished.
@mactimko @BarackObama yes ban hiv instead
@BarackObama  I think you're a fantastic President with saintly restraint. Why did you not ban military weapons in civilian hands?
@BarackObama hi i am waiting for SSI. Can you help save my house ? I live in Cincinnati Ohio  1436 burney Lane. Sincerely Greg Gardner
