@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama  there are companies that work around that and turn into PTO which then forces you to take a vacation day if your sick
@BarackObama Seven days of sick pay made my Heart #sing for all Americans when you said this, Mr. President! #GodBlessYou ! :D
@BarackObama 7 days? Illness often requires more than 7 days a year, especially when you have kids. Sick time should be unlimited.
@BarackObama  maybe you should have a talk with Prime Minister Steven Harper about this paid sick leave idea #sickleave
@BarackObama you are hurting small business with this one.  Make it apply to companies with over 500 employees and thus will cost jobs.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama is this for contractors and temps too?  I love the idea but I want details not just broad words.
@BarackObama Too bad about Russia, right guys? But, hey! Cuba! Am I right?

“@BarackObama:"Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn 7 days of paid sick leave." President Obama #SOTU”
@BarackObama I love the idea, and it does make sense, but requiring it by law? I don't think that has a single chance of passing.
@BarackObama Pretty much how I feel about half of what he is saying.
