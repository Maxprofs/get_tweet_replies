@liz_perfect what the UK's problems with the IRA got to do with this American struggle. Where was the UK ...

@liz_perfect the U.S. Is not and should not be the world policeman; nor your whipping boy. We do have commitments at home that come first.
@eyeseewigs as do we, but we stand shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. to fight terrorism, unlike the U.S. Supporting the uk
