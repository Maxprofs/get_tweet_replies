@BarackObama We have to fight capitalism.
@OfficialSPGB @BarackObama You both have been for 7 years
@FaroeNik Pretty obvious @BarackObama has been helping to manage a capitalist economy. Not seeking to end and replace it.
@OfficialSPGB @BarackObama hes destroying it 1 step @ a time
@BarackObama Yes we can & Yes we did! I am indeed grateful that in my lifetime I witnessed Barack Obama make history!
@BarackObama  love you
@BarackObama likeyou brother
@PanagueJanet @BarackObama neng.

@BarackObama Every single day.
@BarackObama yes. Protect. Ban drilling, fracking, strip mining.
@Lmcclend Drill it, frack it, strip it, dammit.  It's there for US.
@ConanRepublican and when it's gone, what happens? It's time to conserve and protect for future generations.
@Lmcclend Really?  You're kidding, right?  By the time ANYTHING'S gone, we will have found a replacement thru technology, as we always do.
@ConanRepublican why does it have to be gone? It doesn't. Invest in renewable energy. Now is the future.
@BarackObama It is a better world with President Barack Obama in it.  Thank you Mr. President.
@BarackObama pls help Syrian pls if you can Obama pls we are so sad
@BarackObama yet you're going to give Iran money and nukes to which they will destroy the world as we know it. #humanityfail
@BeingBrian It's astounding how ignorant this president is, AND his brain-dead sycophants.
@BarackObama meanwhile back in Washington....
@BarackObama @marcylauren How about starting with banning #arcticdrilling and aposing the #TPP?
@NotPlutocracy @MsRock4Ever  Bernie I agree with you completely. We need American jobs for Americans
@galynann @NotPlutocracy @MsRock4Ever Yeah, right, Bernie, you Nazi schmuck.  YOU'VE been fighting for freaking unions all your life. ENJOY!
@ConanRepublican with no unions Americans get low salaries no benefits noraises hours cut and terrible safety violations at work environment
@galynann Untrue.  Unions force companies to relocate offshore.  Unions were fine in the days of child labor.  TOTALLY IRRELEVANT NOW.
@ConanRepublican now they are desperately needed. If companies go off shore they can pay fair tax.  Or not peddle their good on our shores
@BarackObama i want to see you drink you urine
@BarackObama SARCASM: It's a beautiful world. Let's kill and destroy everything to protect it! Make them our enemy! Set them up to fail!

@BigKahuna919191 @BarackObama @Shell I understand that, but we need to switch to alternative forms of energy and stray away from plastic.
@BigKahuna919191 @McL_Erhard @BarackObama @Shell I can't run my damn car on wind or solar!  God almighty, these people are THICK!
@BarackObama Yeah it is beautiful. And you allowing Royal Dutch Shell to drill for oil and gas in the Artic not going to help preserve it!!
