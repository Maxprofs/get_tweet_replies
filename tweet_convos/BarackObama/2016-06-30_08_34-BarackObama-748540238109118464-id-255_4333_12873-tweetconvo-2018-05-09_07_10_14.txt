@voxdotcom make them unable to hear a case until you get a judge
@voxdotcom a woman has a right to her body when it pertains to killing babies. Yet we incarcerate thousands for ingesting drugs
Abortion in Texas: drive to other state.

@LaurenJauregui  what do you think about abortion?
The only cause abortion-on-demand serves is the elimination of accountability of those engaged in irresponsible sexual activity

@voxdotcom since when did a mother have the right to kill her kids lol did I miss the whole liberals trying to save lives thing
.@BarackObama Safe medical facilities are unconstitutional? Who knew? Ladies, take note, your safety does not matter.
Well, at least you aren't claiming that aborting black fetuses is racist. It's about the only thing you haven't said is racist.
@voxdotcom 
But but but  health care  # why go to dr we get all care from pph

Mr. President Erdogan like a loving bride puts bridal cake in mouth of King of Qatar. My God, they too!
they think they should restrict what we do with our vaginas, but we can't restrict their gun rights?? #Wow #Safety1stAlways
@voxdotcom you have been the most feckless president of all time
Abortion is murder. Abortion tells individuals if is ok to kill to achieve their objectives.
ok tbh people have their own personal reasons for their reproductive choices, so this is fantastic on all fronts huzzah
Please provide the line in the constitution that allows people to kill their unborn child. I can't find it.
slippery slope sir, better just back off!
Planned Parent Hood LLC aprivate corporation making a profit on abortions with no oversight & contributing $ 2 HILLARY good job
Good
@voxdotcom 
You are the most anti-family traditional president we ever had, you are familyphobic.
since when does BO care about the Constitution?
8 years in office and all of a sudden you are telling us what is wrong with the USA, where have you been Christopher Columbus?
@voxdotcom  Thanks Mr President
good it should never be up to anyone to choose for our rights.
oh but nevermind the unconstitutional restrictions you're forcing on American citizens. What bill of rights/balance of power?
make it rare but not so extremely
Are you pro life ... what an idiot question. Women decide whether they want to have a child or not - no one else./Sweden
who the person that's going to stand up for the unborn? #rights #baby #doesanyonecareabouttheunbornchiled
@voxdotcom so when is there a right to life.
@voxdotcom #Disgusting #Murderer #PopulationControl
Law does not allow abortion beyond 2nd Trimester. Tell me this 22 week old isn't a child.
the #SCOTUS should not have denied women the right to birth control under their health plans #mybodymybusiness

I don't want abortion. I need surgery
lets celibate because we can not kill too many babies or kill them fast enough
@voxdotcom Obama gets a kickback from Planned Parenthood for selling baby parts. And that's not meant to be funny.
. Obama is the Best president since ...
@voxdotcom someday maybe you could have as much compassion for the unborn as you do for the undocumented. #AjudicatedMurderers
Let the wholesale slaughter of unborn babies continue. ISIS has nothing on us.
Obama can really care less about women! pro-choice isn't feminist!
Don't make women a scapegoat to face all kinds of reproductive mutilations for billionaires' economy
like the right to continuity of care, or the right to the same high standards as a surgi center - Bad news for all women.
@BarackObama
The live dismemberment of human beings
is not "women's reproductive rights", @BarackObama.
You, & @TheDemocrats should be ashamed.
Bravo monsieur Obama
I believe in a woman's right to choose. I know what can happen if there's no proper care. We lost a family member. Thank you
So Trump wants to make American Great Again? Then why the "greatest" golf course in Scotland, not America?
@voxdotcom Joy Joy, there is victory and strength in protecting woman's rights. We make the country STRONGER!
people freak out about the assassination of a potentially violent gorilla but not the systematic killing of babies.
millions of babies innocent little babies
@voxdotcom what about the rights of those who will never have life
Should I be glad that revenge is from the Lord & not ours -Christians- May the Creator make u realize youre nothing but dust
@voxdotcom ...you misspelled baby murder...
@voxdotcom Im pro "women's-right-to-her-own-body-and-you-have-no-say-on-what-she-does-with-said-body" . Also pro-womens health.
Spin it how you want to justify killing your own child.
well I will never have children but a mother's health is more important. Hate to break it to you.
@MarshaBlackburn @PPFA Marsha must really suck your state is filled with retards that should drown it give the state to Mexico
@voxdotcom welcome .......
thanks my president for all things that you give us in this world for be better
Maybe you should replace them by limiting the reproductive rights of gun owners ?
you just believe in killing the unborn and forcing those with religious convictions to capitulate to you and SCOTUS
\/\/H3R3'5 7H3 91ZZ4?
#SCROTUS is more like it... Just kidding you're doing a great job!
Your body is the sanctuary of GOD and if you play with fire you will get burnt. Live a better life and stay healthy.
@voxdotcom About time.  We can't be complacent. The enemies of freedom never are

.@BarackObama Great news! So I guess if a woman starts to hemorrhage on the table you just call 911, huh? Or leave her like #KermitGosnell
@voxdotcom OR...#scotus ruling legalizes murder. Truly! Next you guys will make it OK to euthanize any minor aged child.
