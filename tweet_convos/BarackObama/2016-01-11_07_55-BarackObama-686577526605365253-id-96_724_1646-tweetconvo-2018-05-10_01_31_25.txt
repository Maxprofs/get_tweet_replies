@PeebsY0 @OFA @WhiteHouse Well, the ones who are participating are mostly in part time work. How's that for science?
@PeebsY0 @Kenny_Bworse @OFA @WhiteHouse Obama couldn't hold Reagan's jock! 4% growth for 6 yrs, something Obama's NEVER had!
@PeebsY0 @Kenny_Bworse @OFA @WhiteHouse What does that tell u about Obama? TAX AND SPEND LIBERAL who's all about redistribution
@OFA @BarackObama Delusional. You've been propping this economy up with bailouts and the Fed for 7yrs. Most of these jobs are part time.
@OFA @BarackObama Politics? You mean like the 200,000 more H-1B visas you approved for foreign workers in the Omnibus? U Suck!
@OFA @BarackObama @WhiteHouse God you're an awesome President! Why do you have to leave us?! 4 MORE YEARS! 4 MORE YEAR! 4 MORE BEERS! Sorry.
@SaxtonJason @OFA @BarackObama @WhiteHouse What are you smoking?
@nmiamifl  Ask a real question or quit trolling! I'm at work!
@OFA @BarackObama And there is still a 10% real unemployment rate. What about them? #Bernie2016
@Ergh33 @OFA @BarackObama There will be everytime unemployment. No state can have a 100%employment rt, cause some people don't want to work.
@Lauthelmchen @BarackObama That's your excuse for millions of underemployed or unemployed people? Deal with it? Bad answer. #BernieOrBust
@Ergh33 @BarackObama Moment... are we actually talking about 10%? or 30%? It is a idea, that the country spend direct into more Jobs. #Keyne
@Ergh33 @BarackObama but it would be bad, if there are not enough labours.
@Lauthelmchen @BarackObama Not as bad as millions of Americans living on poverty-line due to labor exploitation and trade deals #Bernie2016
@Ergh33 @BarackObama Again. Are we talking about 10% or 30%? 10% is a totaly normal rate. Maybe a better Jobseeker - help.
@Lauthelmchen @BarackObama If 10% is a normal rate, I dont want to see a bad rate. With rising inequality, you are out of touch with reality
@OFA @BarackObama U$ 18.3 TRILLION federal debt; the most important # is not brought. The best way to weaken a nation: increase its debt.

@OFA @BarackObama Still the slowest recovery in history, but thank you for giving a boost to the gun industry. Gun Salesman of the Decade.
@OFA @BarackObama @WhiteHouse redefined "full-time" from 40 hours to 30+
@OFA @Smith83K Just think how many jobs would have been added with a jobs bill. Republicans are Toxic. Ugh..
