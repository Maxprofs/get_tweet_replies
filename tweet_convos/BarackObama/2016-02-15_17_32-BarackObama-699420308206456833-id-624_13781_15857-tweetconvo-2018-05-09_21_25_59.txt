@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar ...Kendrick Lamar raps about selling drugs - how is that a brighter future?
@Pembrokes_Men @kendricklamar selling drugs was his only option to create a living based on his opportunities as a minority in the States.
@Leafy13_ @kendricklamar There are alot of poor minorities in the USA that refuse to sell drugs cuz they know its wrong.Poverty is no excuse
@Pembrokes_Men @kendricklamar I absolutely understand your point, I agree it's not right. But the fact is that it is one of the only options
@Leafy13_ @kendricklamar Not for followers of Christ.  Poverty is no excuse to do evil.
@Pembrokes_Men @kendricklamar Fair point. Also important to note is that Kendrick is a Christian himself. Listen to To Pimp a Butterfly :)
@Leafy13_ @kendricklamar ...Christ is forgiveness;But idealizing selling drugs does not uplift a community. Sending u a hug over Twitter. :)
@Pembrokes_Men @kendricklamar I encourage you to explore his work, he speaks a lot of forgiveness. Sending you a hug right back, enjoy :)
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Hey thats fantastic. As an aside 8 cops were shot last week. When is their tweet coming?
@CarmineSabia @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Go to http://killedbypolice.net  and then go to The Counted and look, over 100 killed by police 2016
@UnitedFrontRev @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Take a look at how many of them were committing a crime or were armed. Then ask if I care.
@CarmineSabia @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar and you go talk to your white mass shooters thanks
@UnitedFrontRev @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Y would I talk to them? They commit far less murders than blacks.
@CarmineSabia @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar there's far more white on white crime then black on black crime
@UnitedFrontRev @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Not by ratio. Only because theres hundreds of millions more white people.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar when the whitehouse is white again it will be stale and boring as paint on a wall. Shout out to President Obama
@sdixon3171 @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar I pity your racist, feeble mind and hate-filled heart for not realizing that you are the problem.
@1983Merman_ @WhiteHouse  I pity you for being you must be lonely Anthony rotola. Then again with people like trump and duke u got company.

@WhiteHouse Still no comment on the murdered police officers in the last week?  Time to comment about your favorite rapper though. You suck.
@WhiteHouse so you can tweet and support a rapper but you can't even acknowledge any of the ten police shootings that have happened in 2016?
@jaymoFOsho @WhiteHouse How about you acknowledge the 100 people killed by police so far this year http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database …
@WhiteHouse How about to those #Democrats fighting to keep #Kissinger influence at bay? https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kissingers-green-light-argentinas-dirty-war-five-time-andersen … #LifeProject @kendricklamar
@InsightCaptain @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar 我来自天津，我们有谦卑传统的，但不代表我们没有声音：要求检察官撤销对梁彼得的起诉，全美华人大游行声援梁彼得
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar is this a joke?  Where's the press conference for the 7 officers who have died in the line of duty?  Disgraceful
@KimberlyBombard @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar How about a press conference for the 100 who died this year so far http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database …
@UnitedFrontRev @jonswaine How about not fighting, and pointing weapons at the police?  Hmmmm
@KimberlyBombard @jonswaine How about we don't and anyone who believes that is an idiot
@UnitedFrontRev @jonswaine next time you need help call Anyone BUT the police. Y'all  bitch but when you need them you're fast to call 911.
@WhiteHouse I have supported and voted for you twice, but to shout out to an artist against LEO's makes me rethink it.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar #dope
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar It's just photos. Demonstration beats conversation all day long.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar you are the man
@WhiteHouse @JesseKay @kendricklamar Great compliments from our president.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar There was nothing positive about that performance. Smh @ POTUS
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar potus didn't you just make a statement about being president as a serious job, yet you're giving shout outs? smdh
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Congrats to Kendrick Lamar ..ur greatest fan
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar how about some words on all the LEO's killed this week.  I guess the Grammy's are more important.  What a world!
.@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar What is wrong with you people??  "Working to build a brighter future"??  Just more blatant pandering to blacks.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar how about acknowledging the POLICE OFFICERS who have been killed in the line of duty????
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar AMEN:-)
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama where is the shout outs to the families of the falling LEO's? #BlueLivesMatter
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how ironic you meet with black lives matter but not the fallen police. shameful!
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar unreal!!!  In a bad way 
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar not a word about police officers nationwide being ambushed and killed, but a "shoutout " for this.  Really?
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar salute Kings.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar they said he's a big pussy, as I ate coffee water, and corn.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar How does blaming the wrong people for your problems make the future brighter? The REAL problems still remain.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Disgusting! This can't be serious.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar oh such important issues
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Holy Jesus Christ on a coffee cup are you kidding me! 2 cops shot last week and THIS makes the radar! #YOUSUCK
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar gotta love this
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar #RIPBabyAutumnJohnson
@WhiteHouse you're a joke
@WhiteHouse Are you kidding me? A "Shoutout"? Hows about a "Shoutout" for our police officers killed in the last two weeks?
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Seriously?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar Help us to pray for our enemies O gracious Lord God,  help us choose words of prayer.
@WhiteHouse 

Cops dying in droves the last two weeks and this office is supporting that indirectly. Congratulations.
@WhiteHouse 

Ridiculous. "Shoutout"? How diminutive and unprofessional for the highest office! The current occupant is a clown.
@WhiteHouse Where is the outcry for all the Law Enforcement killed these past 2 weeks? Worst President in history!
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar Sad!!! Not the proper behavior for POTUS
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar so spitting about drugs and dicks is what our whitehouse is about.  Embarrassed to live in this country
@Jassemoto @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Where did anyone say that? There is a difference between glorifying and discussing a reality.
@NPGPC @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar I'll remember that when he is taking about how big his dick is.
@Jassemoto @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Yes because that's all his music is about... Manufacturing an issue to fit your narrative.
@Jassemoto @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Notice the shoutout to all Grammy artists. Only reason Kendrick was mentioned was b/c the video.
@NPGPC @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar to top it off, his music is terrible bit I realize that is a matter of Persians taste.
@Jassemoto @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Again entirely irrelevant. Nowhere in the post did they tell you to listen to Kendrick Lamar.
@NPGPC @WhiteHouse @kendricklamar I expect something that is endorsed by the White House to be acceptable for my kids.  Expectations 2 high
@WhiteHouse How about a shoutout to all of the LEO's that put their lives on the line to protect us?
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar anti-police, pro drugs and gang violence. Future is doomed. Holla!
@WhiteHouse This is disgraceful. No statement about the police officers killed in the last week, but a "shoutout" to Lamar...
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Only people filled with hate see race-fueled vitriol and division as a "brighter future." Your souls need help.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar  #BlueLivesMatter #havesomeclass Bet secret service is happy you support antipolice artists. Shout out? Really???
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Wearing prison garb & slave shackles while impugning half of America based on skin color is "a brighter future"?
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar this serious? What a joke! Shoutout to all those who lost their lives protecting ours! What a disgrace.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar this is actually so pathetic
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar The White House gives a shoutout to a rapper that uses a vandalized police car on stage with him? W O W
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar We pray for there to be good morals in all parts of America without exception. Our Father. .........
@WhiteHouse do you even care that the police who maintain daily order are being thrown under the bus?
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Really? Do you wonder why people around the world think the current administration is a pussy filled joke?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama congratulations @kendricklamar
@WhiteHouse Typical. Our police officers are being gunned down and of course NoBama stays quiet. Counting down days till he's out of office
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar  what would you say if a white person said those same things - you are right about being transparent for sure
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar do you know the lyrics of his song Mr President - how is that building a bright future???
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar @SnoopDogg #green #revolution
@WhiteHouse @BarrackOb  where are the shotouts to all the great military men & women who fight to keep this country safe ? Smfh #trump4prez
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Anti police and supporting the drug market. Sounds like a bright future..... Lol
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  how about a shoutout to the police officers killed due to your complete disregard to their life vs hood rats.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Are you ^%*&#&* serious?!?!?  This country is going to shit and is turning into a ghetto farm.
@WhiteHouse @RealDonaldTrump Our next POTUS would never let this go by.
@WhiteHouse we ask you to help us please!!
Puerto Rico needs you Mr President @POTUS @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse WTF, a song at the Grammy's "we hate the popo, want to kill us dead in the street for sure, niga."  And you give it a shout out
@WhiteHouse any shoutouts for the slain police officers or military personnel that worked to make america a better place?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 6 police officers murdered in less than 1 week and not 1 word about it. Congratulations on building a brighter future.
@WhiteHouse how about all the police officers killed these past 14 days? Where is your concern with that. #BlueLine #Bluelivesmatter
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hope you nominate a black woman judge
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar You still don't know about your future. They are expecting 9/11 attack again. I know them.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar I just had to log in to see if this was real. #salute 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama but  refuse to acknowledge the police officers gunned down . But let it be a career criminal &u send people there.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar @madkar111
What does the #Quran say about #Jesus & #Mary peace be upon them?
@WhiteHouse  maybe the Whitehouse needs to quit playing favorites? Fine line between  propaganda and a new civil war?
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar @bdoulaoblongata funny how when one side takes a stance its "politically charged", but if its white its "racist"
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar @PressSec  Lamar was tremendous, profound, melodic, powerful. Appreciates your shout out, too, I bet. Love u all.
Hey @WhiteHouse, you think @kendricklamar would rather see tweets about the police officers who have recently lost their lives? #priorites
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar Why do you applaud a racist who calls our police po-po's?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I just want to ask :Do u feel happy for not doing real effort to stop the horrifying war Russian lunches against S
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar Deadbeat 'president' Obama shames the USA and the White House. There's been no real president for 7 years.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kendricklamar You've gone too far with murdering Scalia. Now it's going to catch up with you. FBI coming for you.
@WhiteHouse @KendrickLamar Shoutout for the thug culture that's killing police officers. Not one word for them. @BarackObama @POTUS is a POS
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar seriously White House ur a joke. Like u haven't said shit about 10 cops dying in a week. I regret voting for him
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar @BarackObama this is what's up & key to deliver the message CHANGE IS NOW & Kids don't buckle like "grown ups"
@WhiteHouse  embarrassing

@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar the best tweet ever.
@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar this shoutout is coming from  the "White house"? Seriously? As a black person, I find this very divisive.
@WhiteHouse How about a shout out to the police officers killed in the line of duty. No? Nothing? Crickets? #ThinBlueLine #BlueLivesMatter

@WhiteHouse @kendricklamar you guys are clueless.... This guy isn't doing crap.... We have innocent police, military vets, just random
@WhiteHouse Can find time to praise a thug rapping about home invasions/murder but can't comment on the incessant assault on police. Shame!
