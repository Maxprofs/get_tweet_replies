@barackobama With respect, Mr. President, probably not the best day to call the U.S. "exceptional".
@renzaglia @barackobama Germany, circa 1945.
@renzaglia @barackobama True. "black & white" would be Eric Gardner being choked to death on camera for selling cigarettes.
@charles_gaba @Renzaglia @BarackObama The choking was not intended. The thug put himself in a dangerous position. Don't do the crime!
@chrischrisw1017  So the death penalty for selling cigarettes. Got it. Fuck off.
@charles_gaba idiot one sided liberal
@alizinaty @BarackObama @US Serena Shim American journalist killed and turkey
