Nominate a conservative judge.
that would be a disaster
not really. Maybe they would actually follow the Constitution
and roll back the rights and freedoms hard fought for
doubtful, taking rights is a Dem move, not a conservative one
tell that to the citizens are now able to get married
oh? Hillary opposed gay marriage. As did her husband. DoMA passed during Clinton administration.
and those are shameful occurrences, but at least she has spoken in favour of equal marriage since

message from Americans, Go To Hell !!!!

Your term is almost done; let it go!!!
Look, once and for all... The GOP is NOT going to "do its job". They're DOING the job they get paid the most for.

HOPE  WE GET REPUBLICANS OUT THAT THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED! DRUMPF  AGAIN HIS STUPIDITY AND MADNESS!! DUMP  DRUMPF!  SCAT

It's highest rating for trying to change our constitution! Shut up and get out of office!!
#congresionaltraitors!
.@MitchMcConell & his rudderless GOP cronies are in a lose/lose/lose situation now (presidency/senate/dignity)! @BarackObama @KaylinWinters2
I hope that #Congress will do their jobs. If they do not work, they should not get paid.
hope this installation occur before this POTUS elapse tenure
Trump will be chairman
& his cronie party are the biggest LIARS, RACISTS, BIGOTS, downright CRIMINALS, far worse than ISIS, ON face of this planet!!
I agree. People say we're on wrong track, it's not you, it's due to the congress not doing there job. I'm proud that you
the police in USA as well as the senate leaders work in the same way. You'd never think this happens in USA. #AbuseOfPower

#LGBTQ angry at @POTUS @BarackObama. They thought Judy Garland was his @SCOTUSnom. @SCOTUSblog @scotusreporter @Scotus #LGBT @AnnCoulter
He looks like a pussy whipped beta male that would find a right to safe spaces in the Constitution.  Rancid.
@POTUS @BarackObama to demand Election 2000 recount & review to overturn Super Bowl I. @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @AnnCoulter @EvanSayet
you mean a progressive outfit giving a progressive judge a high rating?? You don't say????
The American Bar Association is aLiberal cesspool and your judicial nominee is not a conservative. No confirmation hring for U!

It would be great if Hillary nominated you to the bench. Maybe Michelle. The GOP would burst in flames and never be seen again.
Sorry, he's not on Trumps list.
Damn the repubs for refusing to confirm Judge Garland, insulting President Obama
am i the only one that read "Judy Garland" and smiled?
thank you Senate Leaders for NOT voting for Judge Garland.
How bout you stop trying to impose your will on everyone in Senate and the United States. #doYOURjob
...bien.
Lawyers love Garland? Thats more a con than a pro. Yes, #Congress should #DoYourJob & block #Obama's statism. #Debate
Mr. President, don't trip. When @HillaryClinton wins, she'll put a liberal, and that'll make me wish they did it right
Highest rating in what???
This is a reason not to vote for republicans! They sit on their ass and do nothing, just to rebel against POTUS for past 8 yrs!
shut up Barry. It's not about u anymore. 8 yrs is enough. Go call in your Tee time
Aren't you due for a vacation? It's been a couple of weeks.
WE WILL LET PRESIDENT TRUMP PICK THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE...YOUVE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY.U AND HILLARY CROOKED
Please do your job, Senate leaders.
We don't want YOUR man in,we don't want Hillery either you did enough damage to AMERICA vote Trump

They have been against you from day 1. Even when the Dems had the House & Senate. Its been a total disgrace to America.
You know nothing of integrity. If you did you wouldn't have sold American's to insurance companies.
he supports TPP, therefor the NWO which is why poppy Bush who fast tracked gmo's without study is voting for hrc. U sell out.
when are you going to do your job?
Republicans have given u the reason 2 appoint Garland 2 the Bench of the SCOTUS by failing 2 do Their duty " Appoint Garland"
garland is pro tpp, good job in blocking him
I like u.
stop begging the POS senate leadership n tell McConnell he's about to have some trouble w that cocaine tanker his family owns.
i really appreciate who u are
Republicans in the Senate: DO YOUR JOBS.
useless republicans.
they won't give the black guy another SC pick.Tell it like it is. Time to paint them as the bigots they are and stop being soft
PRESIDENT OBAMA,I THINK WEARE GOING TOHAVE TO WAIT UNTIL. HILLARY BECOMES POTUS ITS UNFORTUNATE THE SENATE WILL.NOTDO THERE JOB
agreed we need a VOTE !!!
my boss would if I wasn't doing my job!
u ppl are an embarrassment for America and its system. Withhold their salary then and let's see if they do their job then?
What a farce! Do your jobs is right! Instead of trophy hunting, polishing your guns - actually do your jobs that u are paid for
https://www.facebook.com/mj.raye.9/posts/10209657123776928 …
amen!
When Hillary is elected, I urge Judge Garland to withdraw his nomination so she can pick someone younger and further Left!
I doubt he has any more moral principles than the current corrupt and perverse administration
This is an embarrassment.   There is no legitimate excuse not to consider Judge Garland's nomination.
The chuckle Mr. President? When HRC is elected Prez, watch the lame-duck, GOP majority Senate rush to confirm Judge Garland.
@kristenschaaled read this as Judy Garland
If the bitch wins, Congress shouldn't approve another justice until the GOP is back in the WH!
slmm
the senate is derelict in its duties.  When I was in the Navy this kind of behavior was subject to NJP or even Courts Martial.
this is another reason why Republicans are loosing and hated by the Majority of people!!
But is he to one sided? That's what we need. Assurances of fairness. A person for all. Not the side or party he values most.
As soon as the FBI does it's job correctly.
