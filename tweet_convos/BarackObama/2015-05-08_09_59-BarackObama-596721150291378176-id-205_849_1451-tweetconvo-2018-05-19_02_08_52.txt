@BarackObama @areyou0 Dear Mr. President, I voted for you and love you, but labor has suffered a lot due to these trade agreements:(
That's false! President Obama is leading the Nation forward with this TPP!  @ReiswigR @BarackObama
@areyou0 @BarackObama Perhaps but I have heard these arguments before, and the good jobs went away, very skeptical :(
Logically it would not make sense for Obama to undo his legacy when he historically saved this Nation economically!  @ReiswigR @BarackObama
@areyou0 @BarackObama I remember NAFTA, and Clinton:(
So what! @ReiswigR @BarackObama
@BarackObama

@BarackObama If you don't pay back the debt to China. Guess what. We all do #ThanksObama
@BarackObama those rules need to be good for American workers.
@BarackObama I agree with US President Obama's opinion. I think US & JP must complete TPP negociation ASAP.If not,China'll lead our economy.
@BarackObama 真的很可笑，欲加之罪何患无辞!
@BarackObama China owns us because you don't know how or what to invest in.
@BarackObama  Last trade Over volume of China's products versus ours hurt us Badly.  Why we owe them money. Erase the loans for better deal.
@BarackObama Rule one on incoming international trade: 1000% tariff on digital immigration.
@BarackObama When the playing field includes digital immigration it's tough on the US.
@BarackObama 2nd Rule Equal Racial of Americans  Employers/Employees of distribution of all imports products from China for retail&wholesale
@BarackObama  1sr Trade rule USA on top (Head) of deal & China  the end (Tail) of the deal..For past money cheating acts & attempts.

@BarackObama @hellahueck Well, these 'rules' have led to much domestic opposition in Europe and might even push them more towards China.
“@BarackObama: "If we don't write the rules for trade around the world, guess what: China will." —President Obama #LeadOnTrade”
@BarackObama that is totally true http://www.scout4apps.com/my-candidate.html …
@BarackObama @sil_viar0 WE DON'T WANT MONSANTO IN OUR WORLD #STOPTTIP
@BarackObama fear mongering propaganda, much?
@BarackObama China won.
@BarackObama I'd rather go down the cliff with US blindfolded than walk a plane path eyes wide open with China on this 1. #chinkonodeylast.
@BarackObama 
Since China can only copy designs, and poorly at that, and can't actual engineer anything they are threat because their cheap?
@BarackObama 
Better late than never, good that finally you woke up on China.
But now you (USA) are already way behind them (China).
@barackobama make trade agreements with developing countries.
@BarackObama at this point that wouldn't be such a bad thing
@BarackObama Potus, I don't support you on this one #LeadOnTrade #TPP
@BarackObama competition is good. Makes you work harder.
@BarackObama I trust you Mr. President. You've been right on everything else up until now.
@BarackObama @Maddowblog @MoveOn if deal so good just release the text!
@BarackObama China has taken over the world on a large cost: human beings. That's not what we should do
@BarackObama yea China will
@BarackObama hello Obama
@BarackObama China has created an economic empire; I humbly think that they have already written the rules. We need effective policies ASAP!
@BarackObama the trans-pacific trade deal is not the way to do it. We as Americans have lost enough jobs due to bad trade deals in the past
@BarackObama ....china is comng soon...
@BarackObama successful trade means we produce (for export) as much as we import, which we dont! #StopobamasSpinDoctoring
@BarackObama yes Barack until India is ready ,  you guys need to hold on to it somehow
@BarackObama who falls under we? Elected officials or corporate executives?
@BarackObama wow dear Obama your think is the best
@BarackObama they are ready 
@BarackObama maybe they should, they are booming, polluting like crazy, but booming.
@BarackObama change should happen constantly, not once and then nothing, it should be an ongoing progress without pause and gaps inbetween
@BarackObama You should decide the rules of world economy with your allies,then WE CAN determine the rules for the welfare of mankind!!!
@BarackObama is that a reason to implement bad rules? #TPP #LeadOnTrade
@BarackObama Why do all the trade rules screw American Middle Class & reward the trans-national corporations while foreigners buy our assets
@BarackObama Just like in old times when USA was competing with USSR #Cold War continues.
@BarackObama Мы думаем,что америке, скоро наступит пи..дец!!!(((
“@BarackObama: "If we don't write the rules for trade around the world, guess what: China will." —President Obama ...”
Chinese laminate.
@AntarianRani @BarackwaObama ewf
@BarackObama China's fingerprints are probably all over that thing. #DetailsPlease
@BarackObama there's no such thing as a middle class you're either have it or you don't. Don't be fooled.
@BarackObama pandering to the rights fear of China? Just sad
voted for you both times, @BarackObama, but you are mortgaging and stomping down the middle class with your heinous support of TPP.
@nuclearposture didn't vote for the pompous fool @Obama. I could see what real con artist he is from day 1, even B4 his 1st election.
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama 我不知道
@BarackObama how about free trade oh wait we have no infrastructure  or manufacturing why greed corruption
@BarackObama lead by fear #fail Just lead!
@BrianWhitehurst @BarackObama The UN's powers are restricted since China is one of the permanent members. Besides, China's firms are among
@BrianWhitehurst [1/2] the most competitive and efficient (quality still questionable, a lot of dumping) ones across the globe. The American
@BrianWhitehurst [2/2] MNCs are just worried about the fact that they won't have the monopoly over world's exports anymore.
@BarackObama that's only going to happen if we actually start making things HERE again
@BarackObama Learning about America history they always been Architects/entrepreneurs. But now everythings built they need to be kings.
@BarackObama can someone explain to me what this trade deal is it sounds important
@BarackObama dnt wrry! we wont let tht happen Mr. President. Cz wid Modi, we r on wid our #MakeInIndia #NarendraModi #India #wait&watch
@BarackObama 我同意~
@BarackObama tal vez lo mejor sea una combinación  o suma de voluntades,no le parece?
@BarackObama suprub
@BarackObama China does run the world.... We allowed that to happen Obama. Maybe we should learn to play nice with the other kids
@BarackObama Actually any nation can do as it pleases with no regulation just as will happen with campaign spending and a feckless FEC. #FEC
@BarackObama China should all the good American jobs are in #China #MadeInAmerica #Jobs #jobsearch #jobseekers #Veterans #entreprenuer
@BarackObama #educate #america #medicalmarijuana
@BarackObama es cierto,pero quién decide qué es bueno o malo,mejor o peor??????
@BarackObama isn't this a @realDonaldTrump quote?
@BarackObama Did you mean “If our multinational corporations don’t write the rules”?
@BarackObama i like your candor. no beating around the bush. you speak the truth the way it is. china is a challenge. but i love America!
@BarackObama 哈哈哈。
@BarackObama It's high time US gets rid of this syndrome, either u r for us or against us, that's Bushism, a proven disaster
@BarackObama Every country/company will write their own rules, its free market, all want 2 grow/excel. what best v bring 2 d table matters !
@BarackObama . Mr President please drop "if not us, them" argument. Instead lead in "together for welfare to all" even if it sounds romantic
@BarackObama.  I feel you president Obama.. In all honesty i think you did a hell of a job for this country. God bless America.
@BarackObama using the tag #AddJustinBieberOnShots  
@BarackObama your are joke?
@BarackObama I miss the Monroe doctrine, things were better for the country as a whole.
@BarackObama too late!
@BarackObama #PissPoorDecisionmaking from our so called leaders has left the country vulnerable, vote  #NoneOfTheAbove
@BarackObama Will the rules you write be right, fair and just?
@BarackObama how about you write the rules WITH China, so we dont have this perpetual geopolitical testosterone contest.
@BarackObama @surnell @Swamy39 @DineshGhodke now this is called self proclaimed big brother
@BarackObama  I agree but please make fair for USA  textile industries
@BarackObama please do not underestimate any other country there is every possible reason why US will follow the rules governed by others.
@BarackObama Ironically, China has come to stay. But, America is not leaving anything for granted. The true American spirit.
@BarackObama Lead or follow. Let's give the world, "MADE IN THE USA", fairly & profitable again. Not just the rich but "Trickle UP" huh?
@BarackObama true. Very true
.@BarackObama Multinational corporations are writing the trade rules. They have no allegiance to American workers. Nike, for example.
@BarackObama 
 Prostration . Great sir
@BarackObama Un abrazo querido hermano Obama AA
@BarackObama ..so what...?
@BarackObama America Empire has to be the worst I've known of history.
Look at they kings
Look at they lady's
Look at they kids
#Ashamed
@BarackObama  When you say "we," you're referring to yourself and the flood of corporate lobbyists and lawyers, right?  #NotantherNAFTA #TPP
@BarackObama  "It is your just a dream to sop the rapidly increasing economy of china."
@BarackObama what make both(China and USA) of you to write rules for the world?
@BarackObama @Duustang we must learn mandarin!
@BarackObama China is not We?? (human)
@BarackObama  We didn't write the rules of the #TPP , corporate lawyers did that.  We aren't allowed to see the contents of the #TPP either.
@BarackObama so you hate Chinese people ey
@BarackObama It's not too late even now. #LeadOnTrade
@BarackObama it's fine to #LeadOnTrade but let us see the deal. We don't want to get burnt again. #LetsSeeTheTPP #p2 #WhySoSecret?

@BarackObama But world trade needs to be discussed amongst the nations, not be taken over by America. Collaborative effort!
@BarackObama Nafta has proven to take jobs away.  TPP appears to be more of the same.  Prove the benefits or withdraw.
@BarackObama don't u think China is doing that for years
@BarackObama Your Excellency did you said that>?. Mmm, seems scared of #China unless someone hacked your account Sir!!.
@BarackObama By "we" u mean lobbyists for big biz in secret and NOT We the People.
@BarackObama Americans might  be more receptive to this if you asked  @SamuelLJackson to explain it. Nothing against you sir.
@BarackObama like tears for fears said: "everybody wants to rule the world"...easy man, there's enough for all...I hope...LOL
@BarackObama yes,china will
@BarackObama ,well,China will.
@BarackObama I agree, but seriously we need to fix at home!!  Indiana is limiting trade between states with HB1432, Indiana permits/security
@BarackObama Don't forget Russia!
@BarackObama Yes, and now you're letting corporations decide about the rules.
“@BarackObama: "If we don't write the rules for trade around the world, guess what: China will.Obama 
fair rules not TTIP
@BarackObama Follow me we need to talk
@BarackObama be cara full obama
