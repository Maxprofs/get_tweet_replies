@BarackObama only in your mind and it will be one of many things that changes the moment you leave office.
@Budd0427 @BarackObama I'll take that bet.
@TheBigShow1976 @BarackObama didn't know I made a bet but the country had had enough of this shit
@Budd0427 @TheBigShow1976 @BarackObama sooo...you would do a better job?
@ChristieRainwa2 @TheBigShow1976 @BarackObama so you are one of the few that think the Muslim is doing a good job?
@Budd0427 I survived Bush. You will survive Obama.
@AlidaCella I survived them both. We just have a lot of work to do thanks to Obama
@Budd0427 and a lot more to do because of Bush. Still recovering big time from that one, lest we forget.
@BarackObama @TechJournalist Uh, now about all that horrible poverty on Native American lands, what can you do about that?
@ArtByAlida nothing, he gave all our tax money to his political friends and Muslim relatives, no help where really needed, he is BS
@johnchino01 You are so misinfomed...too bad so sad. Bye.
@ArtByAlida facts are facts
@johnchino01 @ArtByAlida Provide a link to these so called facts. I will wait. Oh wait I don't need to because there are none to prove it.
@kimmy12319 sure sounds like a closed mind, not helpful to your future
@johnchino01 @kimmy12319 Cons cry when they don't get their way....
@papaouch your mistaken,  minorities march, riots and cries until politicians give them their way for their votes, i.e., Obama and his kind
@BarackObama what a piece of crap you are to do that to ohio and it's former president, let's call North Africa Obama
@johnchino01 @BarackObama States Rights Rightie stop crying Whaaa!!!

@johnchino01 Don't bet on it; get use to calling it Mt. Denali!!!
@papaouch maybe it will erupt on him while camping, nice finger

 all you ignorant racists out there: 
    F-21-3-11 OFF!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama There is a disturbing undercurrent of bigotry in this nation. This fight is not about a mountain, but how we feel about us.
@BarackObama Too many personal attacks over an issue that really doesn't affect anyone personally. Yet people are mean to each other nothing
@BarackObama Out of respect for the Koyukon People of the great State of Alaska it is altogether fitting that we honor their request.
@BarackObama WTF, over
@BarackObama Why the vitriol over the naming of a mountain. Denali {high mountain} is what the native Koyukon tribe have always called it.
@BarackObama @POTUS
Thank you! @GOP gonna try have you arrested and impeached bc of this. Actually bc of your color, but they'll pretend not
@BarackObama yassssssss

.@DarthSavage1220.@BarackObama The state didn't decide, another executive action.
@john_b_eats The state has called #Denali by that name since 1975. It's the big govt cons in Ohio that have blocked fed name change

@BarackObama the destruction of Alaska and its wildlife come after the Climate Change promotion we understand. Lies & profit over everything
