where is your proof that they don't? Don't just disagree for disagreeing sake. Present your facts.
Are you disagreeing with POTUS statement or agreeing?
hmm industrial revolution was the starting point on temp rising. Humans have directly caused this.
Obama knows as much about climate change as he knows about health care & being honest
show proof. Obama knows more about that then Trump ever will. And more than you do.
umm yes there is. It was made in Paris. Research before posting ignorant comments.
it is credible. It is a plan. It is agreed to by everyone there. It is better than doing nothing.
we did not reject the paris one. It was accepted. The republicans rejected it because of stupidity.

@OFA What if we used hemp instead of wood and kept trees growing.  That would help I would think.

Sir, standing up for bold action seems available only for people in the U.S? I thought we, or I, Asians, could help too. 
sir we can do better climate if we can control and reduce human population 50% below up to 2050. Otherwise god will sure do .
