@whitehouse @seenaoromia
@WhiteHouse what exactly i keep to defend myself that you have left these armed spies-terrorists of enemy background countries after me?
@WhiteHouse but im always kept under gun point by the establishments of US/UK/Aus itself. i always ask a question
@WhiteHouse at least kept me safe enough to date. i value it, and kept appreciation after surviving on those many life-murder threats
@WhiteHouse and its mainly because you people based in US+UK+Aus always know,im an indefensible person walking on roads,easy to threaten me
@WhiteHouse thanks and regards
@WhiteHouse why you always "want to" help me, if its your own people have been a threat over a single, indefensible, civilian like me?
@WhiteHouse or those of Bangladesh+Pakistan False Indian ID infiltrators threatening me, who all work for US+UK+Aust itself?
@WhiteHouse whether its those handling my body for years, giving mental-physical torture whenever i try to open mouth
@WhiteHouse why do you people help me, if its your own people have been threatening me?
@WhiteHouse which could be hardly avoided....
@WhiteHouse and yes, first i myself has to be honest to accept that i was always helped on key times, mainly from US's/UK's and Aus leaders
@WhiteHouse you can't lie to me, this much credibility i do expect from the 'elected' government of US+UK+Aus...
@WhiteHouse 4 years gone in India itself while continuously living under a life threat,it might be a secret for rest of world, but you know
@PittWitchHunt @WhiteHouse @BarackObama POLICE are CRIMINALS! BRUTAL KILLERS!
@PittWitchHunt @WhiteHouse @BarackObama I no longer feel comfortable even calling the police!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @PressSec Why watch more lies from this traitor?  He created the situation in Baltimore including white man beaten nearly dead.

Thank you very much!!

@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse i was offered US's passport recently.and my willingness to work in Indiana state of US, which has water border with Canada too
@WhiteHouse its US's tax payers,why you maintain Air Force One,while keeping these people after me to threaten me in India or anywhere i go
@WhiteHouse This is the United States. Not a third world country. We can NOT allow rioting and anarchy in our streets.
@_SgtSapper @WhiteHouse but "Great America" allow cops to have a divine ruling over black lives..cops are given anarchy privilege in dt case
@WhiteHouse you have put arms on hands of foreign spies of Pakistan+Bangladesh and other Muslim countries, as funded by budget of US+UK+Aus
@WhiteHouse hence, if i start throwing stones on US embassy for the way me and people related to me suffered, you have to maintain passions
@WhiteHouse my behavior has been a response to circumstances i faced. around 4 years gone in India itself, when i arrived here in Aug 2011
@WhiteHouse and you can't take any action against me, as government resources were used to take out money from my pocket.
@WhiteHouse even if i dont get a proper response from the US's embassy, im planning to now sit in front of US's embassy from now onwards
@WhiteHouse as a government as whole, you must be 'honest first'. this much 'credibility' i do expect from the 'elected' government of USA
@WhiteHouse but you can't lie to me in US's embassy, that you dont know these things continuing with me.
@WhiteHouse life threats to me by using Bangladeshi+Pakistani false ID infiltrators, very frequently, might be a secret for rest of world.
@WhiteHouse and US, along with UK+Aus, are part of all these. you simply can't say that you aren't responsible for anything ongoing with me
@WhiteHouse i live a life everyday, a form of life threat on roads,in my dreams, physical-mental torture etc,is being given to me for years
@WhiteHouse 2nd; and you can't say you can't help me, while doing so many things with me for so many years.
@WhiteHouse 1st; when i come to your embassy, you can't say you dont know me.
@WhiteHouse i would like the leaders of US, mainly governor of Indiana would keep these points in his mind.
@WhiteHouse good day sir
@WhiteHouse @PressSec waiting on the Presser for #Hattiesburg ... Still waiting.

@WhiteHouse there is always a reason to take positive step.& there is always conspiracies against me by using enemy countries Bangladesh+Pak
@WhiteHouse which civilized language the ruler of US/UK/Aus understand,as compare to keep torturing me and organizing life threats on roads?
@WhiteHouse if we exclude high qualified immigrants. the countries where over 50% people have consumed heroine-cocaine at a time of life?
@WhiteHouse are we left with any "civilized" language to talk with US/UK/Aus where 75% people born there dont have class 10th certificate?
@WhiteHouse or even in jail, it looks little civilized as compare to keep me on roads to keep threaten me by using spies of Bangladesh+Pak?
@WhiteHouse but my claims for security concern is always applicable on the US's government too? even if im put in a proper security,
@WhiteHouse as mentioned in my passport, the mount i was owing at the time of making wish......
@WhiteHouse even if my claim on US gone in terms of $18.0billion+ Industrial city+SEZ on my birth place, Gorakhpur city of India,
@WhiteHouse and, i do have some form of claims on the govts of India, Australia and on Russia too for the way things happened to me there,
@WhiteHouse i will only fight to defend myself, with whatever im capable of, even if it may require to go  to jail itself, for a while.
@WhiteHouse until i have life, physical torture,mental torture, threatening on roads isn't enough to finally make me fall on the wrong hands
@WhiteHouse against the hopeful spies of Bangladesh+Pakistan, who all were left after me by the govt of UK/Australia itself.....
@WhiteHouse im nothing but a problem, running somewhere for years, and until i receive help or get killed, i will only try to help myself
@WhiteHouse the US/UK/Australia. who simply dont want to listen anything right...
@WhiteHouse always a reason to do wrong,always a wrong is organized by these people,simply because things are wrong within their own country
@WhiteHouse while now democracy means, no matter how many crimes you do,50%+ voting in a democratic election may help you survive somehow???
@WhiteHouse democracy means, "we all are united for good, for every right step for the society as whole, we vote in unity."
@WhiteHouse thats the main question we have at present....
@WhiteHouse what i may prove and what i can't has no meaning. what blood flow in the body of these 'elected' leaders of US/UK/Australia????
@WhiteHouse and no state level apology is made by governments of US/UK/Aus yet in this regard? level of shamelessness of rulers of US/UK/Aus
@WhiteHouse 4 years of my stay in India including the time when govt agencies of US/UK/Aust are caught while using my IDs for serious crimes
@WhiteHouse because i refused to accept help from foreign spies of enemy countries Bangladesh+Pakistan,so many crimes with me and my family?
@WhiteHouse certain death of goodness in world, when a person to be punished because I refused to join serious crimes by govts of UK/Aus
@WhiteHouse all you people took, because i refused to join foreign spies of Bangladesh+Pak,who are left after me by govt of UK/ Aust itself?
@WhiteHouse all gone while making my mother-brother like robots in front of mine,looks like their bodies itself is occupied by foreign souls
@WhiteHouse cash worth 50lacs+ in open while my father used to keep over 2-4crore in private too.
@WhiteHouse our assets in India, flats,house,shares worth over 1.5crore, jwellaries worth over 1.0crore,properties worth well over 12.0crore
@WhiteHouse a threat im always kept under,almost since i canceled my return ticket to Australia by mid 2012,after extending it for 6-7 times
@WhiteHouse its more about, "im always kept on gun point and if i dont receive help even one day, its end of my life."
@WhiteHouse continuous mental torture that, i just can't concentrate on anything? threats on roads, and i receive help too?
@WhiteHouse but you know that???
@WhiteHouse i may not be able to prove that im being given continuous physical torture for more than 4 years,including in Moscow during 2013
@WhiteHouse and most of the time govt agencies itself keep playing with me....
@WhiteHouse  serious crimes they organize by bringing people from overseas, using my IDs to do serious crimes, until they are caught?
@WhiteHouse doesn't Australian govt know, why this man is on run from Australia?
@WhiteHouse  how it matter whether i may prove something or not, if you know whats the factors behind, why i keep running somewhere?
@WhiteHouse there are things which are unknown to world, but 'elected governments of US, Australia,UK, including Japan knows whats on going?
@WhiteHouse i would simply follow guidelines provided to me, simply because i need help and i can't help by myself
@WhiteHouse first Australian government would be asked for that and if they hesitate, US is the only rule we have in world???
@WhiteHouse i do need help, financial-security related, and most important, i want govt to accept responsibility of anything ongoing with me
@WhiteHouse today im to about, "Discovering a 'civilized' language to talk to the rulers of US/UK/Australia"
@WhiteHouse good day sir
