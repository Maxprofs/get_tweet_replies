We #Democrats share a #Bible teaching with #republicans "Do not persecute a STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND."THX @BarackObama 4 #Amnesty
@BarackObama I'm willing to bet that there are more Americans in tough hard working jobs then illegals. Let's take care of Americans first.
@BarackObama #ImmigrationAction So there Good Criminals.Good for them.
@BarackObama Jobs which could have been filled by millions of Americans who are not in the workforce.
@BarackObama who cares..there have been criminals on the run in the country the justice system will still prosecute..but not illegals #BS
“@BarackObama: "Most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs."" CONVENENCIERO!!!!!!

@BarackObama they cheated the system so they should get a break. Screw those who followed the #legal process. #amnesty #IllegalAmnesty
@BarackObama It is not our problem. They shouldn't even be here to begin with- ILLEGAL- that word must mean nothing to you#uneducated
@BarackObama   Immigration needs reform.  We must allow for individuals to experience America.  But reform must be done the right way.
@BarackObama   Our fore fathers built the Constitution to prevent one person from having the power, and misusing it.
@BarackObama Which laws can I break now and be rewarded?
@BarackObama Fellow Americans we have faced tyrants before namely King George III, lets protect our country from this self proclaimed king.

@BarackObama illegal immigrants don't deserve jobs! Even low paying ones!
@BarackObama And how many illegals pay the ridiculously high taxes like us LEGAL citizens Barack?!?
@BarackObama _Americans_ work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs, but you're prioritizing criminals over them. Put Americans first.
@BarackObama @UnNuevoDia thanks God bless you!!!
@BarackObama Yeah, because no one else in this country has been here a long time, and works hard in tough environments, for low pay.....
@BarackObama If this happens then we are ready to help them on the path of owning a home. The road to economic success focuses on ownership.
