@WhiteHouse No one gives a fuck. Obama is the worst president in the history of America.
@TNP_Sheepdog @WhiteHouse No, that honor goes to George W. Bush, the one that started two wars, a huge debt, and crashed the economy.
@Emmajc48 @WhiteHouse His approval rating is 41%, wake up. Even his own party gave up on him, he's done.
@TNP_Sheepdog @WhiteHouse That 41% is way more than any Republican and is lower because he has been too considerate of GOP politicians.
@Emmajc48 @WhiteHouse You do realize he is the lowest approved president in history. He is no better than Bush or Nixon.
@robinbmurphy @WhiteHouse Robin, you know what was also an executive action? The Emancipation Proclamation. Should we take that back too?
@robinbmurphy @WhiteHouse That's sad for you.
@robinbmurphy EP was not a law and neither is Obama's action but both fight the mass subjugation of human beings, be them immigrant or slave
@iMAGiNeprints1 @WhiteHouse Well...it still won't stop the browning of. America. Play nice.
@iMAGiNeprints1 @WhiteHouse I have maaany strains of DNA as well. #CrimingWhileWhite take a look.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse We need to take Obama OUT. I am tired of him taking from American's and giving it to foreigners. Give us benefits not them!!!
@WhiteHouse If we go to Mexico they won't change their language for us. We move there we change ourselves. Why do we have to change in U.S.A
@WhiteHouse Obama doesn't want Immigrants to learn our language. We have to change for them. Try going to Mexico. See if they will change
@WhiteHouse immigrants have it better than me. They live off of government help. They make more than I do. What's wrong with this picture!!!
@WhiteHouse I am tired of you taking money out of my paycheck to support  immigrants. Obama take it out of your own paycheck.
@WhiteHouse are you nuts. I do not want to support another lazy ass person! They don't need our government help! We already have them here
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Thank you Mr. President on behalf of all immigrants. God Bless You!!!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama bravo  il presidente obama
@WhiteHouse as a naturalized citizen who went through the proper channels to become an American, I am simply furious. Welcome to socialism!
@WhiteHouse  Congress must pass law that allows a 60% + majority vote of the senate to overide any executive orders by a president.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what a nice kind man.
@WhiteHouse hi
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse Funny how doing the Right Thing ironically empowers ignorance and hatred to exit their "shadows".... #ImmigrationAction
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama great president: Mr. Obama, you are doing a good job!
