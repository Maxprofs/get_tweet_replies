That number is a load of crap and you know it @BarackObama. #Obamacare is just another useless/unnecessary policy of yours. #RepealObamacare
@belcher_jr @BarackObama It's cheaper than paying for someone to go to the emergency room...this is a MUCH better option
Given the massive disruption to my life and my health I beg to disagree, #Obamacare was NEVER needed @wiserationalist @BarackObama
@belcher_jr @BarackObama But the fact that many people couldn't survive if they didn't have Obamacare because their medical is too expensive
Geez how'd they ever manage b4? Another BO tax funded entitlement PS. #Obamacare = 300% more than my prior ins @wiserationalist @BarackObama
@belcher_jr @BarackObama They didn't that's the thing. Obamacare has saved many lives
Number "helped" has been minimal vs total population. Too many hurt vs "helped". Not worth the pain to economy @wiserationalist @BarackObama
@belcher_jr @BarackObama a Biggest bs. Wayyy more people have benefitted from it. That hasn't even hurt the economy
@BarackObama maybe our next leap in evolution is to get rid of the part of our minds that attribute to selfish thoughts.
@BarackObama for them.
@BarackObama I am a socialist and proud of it. Any other way of living is selfish garbage. No matter what I think of a person, I would die
@BarackObama To advance the human race as a whole.
@BarackObama ACA is a good start, but we need "Medicare For All" or a similar single-payer plan.
@JohnCincy @BarackObama there r other countries u can find it,. Plz do.WE DO NOT NEED GOV RUN ANYTHING HERE!!! THE GOV IS CORRUP. B respnsbl
@kay_kingsbury @BarackObama The govt is not nearly as corrupt as the private sector, wall street & bankers. U need to wake up!
@JohnCincy @BarackObama the gov is little more than a stinky sewer line full of corruption/ sh*t, w/lines to every home.Suckin $tuff,blow n$
@kay_kingsbury @BarackObama There are intelligent Conservatives who make rational arguments w facts. Have someone read them to you.
