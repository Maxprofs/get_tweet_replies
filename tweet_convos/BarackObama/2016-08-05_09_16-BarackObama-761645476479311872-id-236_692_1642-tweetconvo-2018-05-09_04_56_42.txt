Going to guess only reason you don't compare this particular stat to Bush administration is because doesn't look good if you do.
The Bush administration is what got us in this mess! Umemployment was at an all time high during his presidency!!
And they normally stack his numbers propped up against Bush admin, but not on this one...this is wages, not UnEmp
Wages also were not improved during Bush administration. At least Middle class has a fighting chance for now.
except, I remember getting decent raises during Bush admin. Not so much now.
That may be true for some, but for many like me, we received pay cuts while add more work hours.
And I have, within the last couple of years, seen layoffs, had workload increased and seen peoples hours cut...
Yes, I agree but not as many in the previous years. Sadly, it's going to take more than 8 yrs, more unity to improve.
@BarackObama Middle class Americans are given opportunities they haven't had in a long time. Wealth should not be only for rich!
Yolando! If you want wealth then stop hlding ur hand out & WORK HARD & SMART! That's how ppl get wealth
I did work hard, retired with a pension so know what you're talking about before opening your mouth.
Welfare system was meant to be temporary & for ppl that are sick down on luck etc Not as a profession
good news
@BarackObama That's probably because people started realizing that inflation had BEEN skyrocketing, leaving wages in the dust
http://dlvr.it/M1TqZ0 
@BarackObama That chart is false! Jobs are at lowest in decades & wages not rising! Min wage to $15 caused people to lose jobs
@BarackObama really?
@BarackObama nominate me to go up against the Morons
Oops.  BLS said they have actually fallen 0.4 percent.  Liars figure and figures lie.  Especially yours!
where are you getting that info??? Dishonest as usual!!!
@BarackObama Lies & more lies. Stop insulting the American people! Show respect,we know the facts & will not accept your lies.
@BarackObama @POTUS
FACT: Millions are still discarded from Labor Force.
FACT: #TPP will discard more.
@realDonaldTrump yes we can and yes we did make America great wayyy before you. Stop taking credit for his work!
@BarackObama we have a great president Trump, .....he's the devil
You must be on crack to believe that
@BarackObama Anyone who says Obama is a horrible President is lying, racist or stupid 
Bullshit! Nice try! We are not all stupid.
@BarackObama in 7 years... And Obama has been in office for about 8.  So what your saying that wages are back to pre-Obama days

@BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
Lies!!!
@BarackObama so is inflation and crime under ovomits watch
@BarackObama due to Americans withdrawing from the work force, not due to job creation.
@BarackObama
bullshit
@BarackObama What does giving $400 million cash to Iran do to our economy, let alone our national security? Criminal!
@BarackObama hai
@BarackObama the only entity that benefits from rising wages is the government through taxes.
@BarackObama only because employers are being forced to. Hours will be cut, prices will go up & people replaced by machines.
@bannerite I'm not part of that stat. No raises for 3 yrs. But only have myself to blame. I'm not very smart
@BarackObama Not according to Hillary. One of you or both are lying...again.
@BarackObama FOR WHO

@BarackObama FACT you staged Sandy Hook.
@BarackObama 
Mr. Oboma personally I think Ying and yang means Balance and the good things in life so help me mr.um hahahahahaha

Russia & China laughs and at us and hacks us @ every opportunity! Corruption runs rampant in WH & Judicial system! I could go on
Another outrageous lie! We r in a recession, 20 trillion in debt! Isis infiltrating our US! Iran basically owns us!

@BarackObama If I hear one more Republican talk about how bad the economy is...
@GoLeftYoungMan :: Imagine how great it would be if wages followed inflation.. #FightFor15 #InciteFor26 #EatTheRich
labor force participation rate is at its lowest rate in 38 years,over 94 MILLION have dropped out of the workforce
@BarackObama great
this number means nothing at all. Q: why has the Military gotten half of this wage increase each year you have been in office?
Does this mean seniors will get SS raise next year?
@ilikepork42 the best small increase in a recovery that sucks .. How's food stamps ?
yeah you look more like the soup kitchen type
@BarackObama Really? Not in Chicago. Not for teachers. YOU MEAN to say THE CEO's wages.  How is that suppose to help USA?
hooray, still waiting for the trickle down
I don't suppose that has anything to do with doubling the min wage or the fact there r 1/2 as many manufacturing jobs prior to u
carrying the chat further, I knew the Republicans were going to trash anything good under Obama
; @BarackObama << #lies
@BarackObama I haven't noticed. This guy takes credit for nonexistant statistics...again
@BarackObama not sure where you got those numbers  but have to call bull#%# on that my wages have gone down
Thanks to President Obama economy miracle
@BarackObama well, it's about time they started to move with inflation treasonous a**hole!!!
@BarackObama @tpcjk i wonder whose fault is it that they are not working? I am self employed and loving it. Not dependent on GOV
@BarackObama - I need a job Mr. President, CAN you help?
grading on the piss poor curve of less than 2% GDP doesn't say much for this headline about #JobsReport numbers
He had no experience. As I said earlier, he was a race card. Nothing more.
He's been a powerful organizer in chief and transformed politics, character, statesmanship, no longer matter
@BarackObama not according to Donald Trump!
@BarackObama so much hate in here. Thank you for all you've done, and are doing for our country!!!
@BarackObama Thanks for keeping. us ou of a Depression.and moving us forward!
@BarackObama give me money
@BarackObama  Qual e o motivo desse salário subir tanto assim.
@BarackObama http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/07/29/seven-years-later-recovery-remains-the-weakest-of-the-post-world-war-ii-era/ …
are you kidding, what about the 94 million people who have stopped looking for work.
IM unemployed bc of this
@BarackObama lo mismo que en España, pero al revés, gracias a las políticas de los republicanos españoles y alemanes
:Why then has Social Security remained stagnant for so long? Costs are rising, but not the return on my 59 year investment. Why?
hapy day france mr OBAMA
@BarackObama 
Support of President Obama to Hillary Clinton definitely have a massive impact on the election campaign.
@BarackObama How is it that people on adverse are bringing home less money then they did 8 years ago #VOTETRUMP #NEVERCLINTON
@BarackObama good naghite
@BarackObama ,THATS A LIE.
isn't that a stupid stat? I'm mean Obama has been there for 7 years.
I'm still making less than I did in 2009. Stop raising taxes!
what??? More Enron accounting!!!
@WhiteHouse
we need wages to raise for the low income
we need a raise in the minimum wage @SenateGOP @HouseGOP  Congress got raises of $8800. Minimum wage workers got $0.00 since '07
You are liars! #liarinchief
crappola, wages are still stagnate, government wages not mine on the rise.
someone tell my boss. Because I haven't seen it.
FACT the participation rate has never been worse
FACT: Wages are rising at the fastest pace in 7 years → http://go.wh.gov/JulyJobs  #JobsReport 
I wonder where this is happening..not in the world I live
- Yes, wages are definitely rising! Job switchers getting more $$$ indicates very tight labor market.
Ok more working means more wages. total income 2009 vs 2015 if more working more tax money that does not help families takehome
That would be total wages. Not the income from each person but from 15 mil. more than all working in 2009. So mean nothing
Impressive given the minimum wage tyranny.  Is this median or "average" BS #executivewages  #VoteJillnotHill
Do you know the difference between the truth & a lie?
"We" are way, way behind the 8-ball. "Gone." School taxes, local debt, USA debt, state debt, gasoline, JOBS??. Hey quit the spin
like standing in front of a tsunami with a bandaid?
I think that these are not adjusted for inflation.. That chart is more impressive!
#WordUp #IOT #Connect #FB #TWTR #GOOgL #AAPL
Stick your lies Americans aren't buying it!
. @WhiteHouse who told you facts have any place in political discourse? I FEEL like America isn't doing well, so it isn't!
but you really haven't created more jobs people just quit looking
Cmon. Stop trying to bullshit everyone.
What is the pace of GDP growth as compared to historical growth after recessions?
great joke!  Very funny!  
Sorry, white house,  the public has stopped taking stupid pills. Better come up with a new strategy.we are not going to take it
GOP: We broke it but you said you'd fix it! Now we want ppl to elect a man who has the same economic policies that broke it
A fifth grader can draw a chart showing wages are even better.  What is your point?
Still not enough to keep up with real inflation and the debased currency. Google "burrito index"
wow what a lame legacy
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
US ARMY Veteran attacked.
Still 94 Million not in labor force. Highest rate on  welfare in Americas history. Only 1.2% economic growth.
Then how do you explain adding 30 million to the food stamps rolls during the same period?
my insurances, medical, utilities, taxes, food, gas all jump wile still earning about the same pay... I'd say I was poorer!
yeah no thanks to the jews.
...for Iranian nuclear physicists.
wow, you've been lying to the American people from day one, since that POS was elected seven and a half years ago
care to comment this video feb 15 from Iran on money for hostages
right before an election
