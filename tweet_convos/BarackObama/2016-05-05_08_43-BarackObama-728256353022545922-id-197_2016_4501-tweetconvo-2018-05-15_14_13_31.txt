@WhiteHouse @POTUS OMG!  How CUTE! On another note, she's not heard because Congress is too busy doing nothing
.@Pastafarian1964 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Gov't is 100% responsible for exposing Flint residents to toxic water. Shameful what gov't can do.
@Edurd You are correct do why hasn't Snyder been held accountable for what he created? @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@Pastafarian1964 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Well, b/c another gov't agency(ies) is responsible for that action, too.  So much gov't incompetence.
@Edurd Snyder's EM - both should be chrgd. Gov't does more good than bad but, it's easier to complain about how bad it is @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@Pastafarian1964 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Agree it's easy to complain - there are SO many examples of incompetence and overreach.
@Edurd You appear to do nothing but complain, Negative Nancy. "Incompetence and overreach". You forgot "tyranny and freedumb" @WhiteHouse
@Pastafarian1964 @WhiteHouse Just to those who don't seem to know about the major issues of our day that have taken their toll on America.
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS  The gov't is 100% responsible for Flint's failure to protect the health of its citizens.  Obama shows up 2 years later.
What about the Republican governor?
Huh? Prosecute a governor for Hillary lying about her email server?  Doesn't make any sense. @debilu2 @WhiteHouse @POTUS
.@WhiteHouse @POTUS "A young girl" should not have been exposed to toxic water.  This is 100% on gov't for mis-managing the utility.
@BarackObama @POTUS  How fake and setup for the cameras,   LOSER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry, #Loser - not my day to feed the #trolls.  #hatersgonnahate
