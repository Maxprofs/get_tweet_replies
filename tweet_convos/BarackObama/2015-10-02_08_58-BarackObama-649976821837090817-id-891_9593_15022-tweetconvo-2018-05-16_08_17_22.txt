@BarackObama Nothing will be done.  We allowed children to be murdered in their elementary school in Newtown, and we didn't lift a finger.
@SotoColor @BarackObama We allow millions to be murdered in their mother's womb.
@onesoldiersmom @BarackObama Yes & right-wingers only want to protect them in the womb. When they go off to school, it's open season, right?
@SotoColor Libs go crazy over a school shooting, but dissect kids for profit and...**crickets**
@onesoldiersmom
@BPalmer771  My daughter had a friend named Katherine, who at 14, was impregnated by her grandfather. That baby had to be born?  No.
@BarackObama Thoughts and prayers aren’t enough because they don’t accomplish a single thing.
@Joe_Hurwitz @BarackObama These things will always happen because our minds are not equal, most people value life by judging their own.
@sykosoma @BarackObama They don't always have to happen. And certainly not as frequently.
@Joe_Hurwitz @BarackObama Nothing is certain or guaranteed in life, we can use the history and statistics to assume it will happen again.
@sykosoma It will happen again no matter what. It’s the frequency we can influence.
@Joe_Hurwitz  Not necessarily, it sounds good but I don't see what could be such an effective influence.
@sykosoma So just to sum up what you’re saying…we should do nothing? Out of our control?
@Joe_Hurwitz people are more worried about a mythical gun regulation that will never happen more than they are about preventing mass killers
@BarackObama yes gun control laws need to be reworked we dont hunt for our food like 1700's.  BUT....
@SandyHookKdCntr @BarackObama and I hunt I enjoy it and there are millions of responsible gun owners
@sampson_jeffrey Jeffery. When you arrive at the pearly gates, God will refuse you entry for killing his beloved animals for fun.
@Sleestewart that's why God made us rulers over all animals an that's why we are top of the food chain
@sampson_jeffrey Hahaha. You are so deluded. We’re not top of the food chain. Go fight animals using nature if you think that’s true. #nogun
@Sleestewart well I wouldn be the first I don't kill innocent  babies or people so
@sampson_jeffrey Lots of Americans seem to think it’s ok to go shooting up schools though.
@Sleestewart we are taking God out of society people don't believe there's a price to pay after they die
Barrack Hussein Obama everyone! 

still trying to undermine our basic liberties even outside of executive office!
Name one specific gun control change that would have made a difference.  Otherwise, be quiet.  We're not interested. @BarackObama
Require the use of discrete metal detectors in all tall buildings. Restrict the use of rifles or un-permitted weapons in places of business.
There are ways to protect people that don’t restrict the right to own weapons. Further, the right to bear arms does not mean secretly.
Where was this Obama today? I didn't see him. But this is what we need. No more prayers. Actions. No words. Actions. Do something.
Thank you @BarackObama ! If ONLY THEY would listen!! 
But they won't because they only care about money & power...
That is so true. !
@Vikkstar123 nobody having guns would have made this horrific tragedy that happened in Vegas much worse.
Bit rich considering you done hee haw about gun control when you were POTUS! No president ever will as it will cost them too many  votes
Our thoughts and prayers are meaningless if we don't take action. 
This carnage is NOT the cost of freedom but an abomination of it.
@BarackObama then take action, make it illegal for universitys to be gun free zones sotthat honest citizens can defend themselves
@BarackObama 2nd Amendment shall not be infringed!
@scott_mccollum @BarackObama Like your other amendments like slavery or the forbidding of women to vote. YOU CANT CHANGE/AMEND THEM!
We need your leadership  badly! Trumpf is a lemming and he's leading us all off a very high cliff! Dangerous man-child!
Here is a campaign to support victims and their families if you wouldn't mind giving it a RT.
Miss you so much Mr.President.
WE WON'T LET EVIL WIN  AMERICA LOVES YOU 
@BarackObama if we stop giving what these shooters ultimately want, THEY WILL STOP. fucking idiots!!!!  I cannot see y its allowed!!!!
@SandyHookKdCntr @BarackObama When it comes right down to it, if someone wants a gun they are going to find a way to get one. Legal or not.
so there should be no restrictions on them at all? Should we also allow people to carry heavy explosives around them legally?
@BarackObama Just BS to infringe upon liberties & make $ Stop making fake terror shootings and there would be no more FAKE school shootings.
@Fatal_ER0r the shooting in Oregon was fake? Tell more? Did the media make it up?
@Manuel94 Name one major event in the media that has been real. Scripted, and actors are frequently used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WweHQzZCoKQ&index=11 …
@Fatal_ER0r Thanks for clarifying, I was not aware that was a fake, any place where I can read more about all these things? Thanks again
@Manuel94 Don't read anything from Mark Dice or Alex Jones (govt agents) I recommend checking out these videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av3kMcTIoSY&index=1&list=PLzRk7rGJUxBSkvm1q583A_6apvxepLykO …
So the way to fix these laws is to get rid of gun-free school zones.  That's what started this whole mess.  When you take guns out of the hands of good people, you create an opportunity for the bad people who don't care about the law. #MAGA
i wish i could retweet this 4020285 times
@BarackObama waiting for you to talk about your home town Chicago and guns! 

Aren't you glad this takes the spotlight off of Russia?
Chicago's guns come from Indiana and Wisconsin, both Red states. Look at the success in NYC, Boston, SF. All gun control cities.
@BarackObama You are blocked I can't take anymore.
And you probably just got blocked by about 90M ppl, including me. Enjoy your bubble.
@BarackObama 
USA - has made a set of remarks
Russian - sent tanks and start killing syrians
#USAccomplice
@mljbl @BarackObama Yea I don't understand that when Putin was just here & then I hear about more Russians fighting in Syria. I'm confused
@skybits @BarackObama الطيران الروسي يقصف مخيم اليمضية في ريف الساحل لمزيد من التهجير وتفريغ سوريا من اهلها الاصليين 
#USAccomplice
History isn't going to be kind to you or @BillClinton who destroyed America. It's truly sad that you're little more than Wall Street puppet.
I'll give you this: You have the most charisma since JFK. You put up with terrible racism and handled it with class.
Your job creation was mostly low paying part time jobs with no healthcare benefits.
Homelessness grew at the fastest rate ever under your Corporate Democrat presidency.
You're a Corporate Democrat and a Wall St. puppet. Much of America has had enough of Corporate Democrats like you:
It was time to take action when you were president. Instead you did things like cut 8.7 billion off food stamps:
Yeah, but we can control all of these things BESIDES gun violence. Gun violence is driven by mental state (which we cannot control)
THANK YOU
Doesn't make sense to you because you're an idiot. Guns empower people to defend themselves. How many guns did McVeigh use?
Thank you, Mr. President.

How can a pissed off father accomplish this and yet a majority of concerned Americans can't restrict gun ownership?

…
He said, after EIGHT YEARS of presidency.
Well, you saw what Trump did revoking your Mental Health gun law.  It will be utterly impossible to move forward on this w/him in office.
Trump makes a peaceful daily life impossible. Every damn day a fresh, new hell.
You and your globalists hopped right on your agenda, didn't you? Couldn't wait. Disarmed Americans are easy pickings for a fascist govt.
Please, Mr. President, help us find a way by lending a loud and respected voice.  Prayers are fine but Congress needs to act decisively.
We have the NRA to thank as they have changed their focus over the decades  from safety and education to political control and manipulation
Wars kill so let's work towards having less not more of them!
You would be surprised at how many violent attacks, robberies, etc. have been stopped due to good gun owning people.
Not mentioning the massive amount of lives saved by guns or refusing to educate people about them is more valuable an agenda to push right?
This was more for you, Zan than Obama. I love that you voice your opinion but please educate yourself on what you're trying to remove first.
So you are OK with your secret service agents protecting you unarmed?
So your against the bill of rights?
Take away guns, & you cant protect yourself from the government  
Hey man maybe the government is turning  communist 
GLAD I LIVE IN ENGLAND SO MUCH SAFER XX
Fuck hope something does happen to  those fucking cocky asshats Americans that are terrible at problem solving with the NK shit
i love my president
#VegasIsLovedByAll
Too right!
If only trunp would think like this.....
No hate or anything but i think Americans are really proud people who dont know the limit
This tweet should be tweeted again now
I miss you, your steady calm, intelligence...

Auto weapons are illegal. Guns in casino illegal. Illegal to murder people. What "LAW" do you think would have stopped this?
No. It isn't different. We should work to make Americans safer from violence. PLease explain how your implied gun control would "WORK".
You mean like making it illegal to drink and drive so nobody is ever killed by a drunk driver, because I'm pretty sure that still happens.
@realDonaldTrump ATTENTION: President Obama speaks. Yes it’s time to take action. Impotent WH ignorance is unconscionable. Thx Pres OBAMA
I cannot understand why private citizens have automatic weapons. Not necessary for hunting or self defense.
Thank you
thank God voice of reason
@vgonzalesauthor At last someone else is saying.
How is it even possible to get these types of weapons?
@GOP and @NRA will find a way to turn it into a "mental health" issue since the shooter wasn't a practicing Muslim or a POC.
Spot on!
Isn't this the same issue you faced while President sir? I agree it's well past time but Please advise what you did to address the issue!

@BarackObama Mr.President pray is not useful and important everytime now it's time to take and make action please contact V.Putin quickly.
@BarackObama Dear President you must be help and protect to Turkey in mediterrenian.
@BarackObama Dear President Obama, what will you do in mediterrenian now.What will you thinks about the Russian Naval ships and MIG planes..
@BarackObama prayer is how we talk to God. you seem to dismiss it but God said in his word to us, you have not because you ask not.
@BarackObama they do violence because their hearts a wicked. Only Jesus can change a heart so what have you done to advance his kingdom?
@BarackObama pray lord who reedem  Israelites in hand of Pharaoh

@BarackObama hhjj8jjg4eevb.

GmbH u b s d up
@BarackObama @AndyRichter THEN DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL!!!! EDUCATE THE PUBLIC GET LAWS PASSED!! BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS!!
@BarackObama @mulligan Every mass democide has come after thier population has been disarmed. Plus criminals don't follow laws. duh #itsmeds
@BarackObama @AndyRichter all you need to do is publicly fund elections! First step! Then democracy works.
@BarackObama @AndyRichter Look at Chicago, where he got his education in our legal system.They have the strictest gun laws & the most deaths
@BarackObama @AndyRichter If homeowners are allowed to arm themselves against criminals, crime will go down.  Also,don't handcuff the police
Never had a problem with our pres @BarackObama until this tweet. Now, I'm just disappointed beyond anything else. Thought he was smarter...
@BarackObama @AndyRichter Still waiting on that legislation, Mr. President.
@BarackObama @AndyRichter and yes prayers are not enough. As we all know nothing fails like the power of prayer.
@BarackObama @AndyRichter when dui's killed Americans even alcohol companies adopt "friends don't let friends drive drunk" and strict laws.
@BarackObama dude have fun in San Diego! Un timely heat but nothing compare to the heat you faced the last 7 years
@barackobama @sacca Another clueless moment for @POTUS
@BarackObama @FMRon ok, so what do we do?Let's hear solutions & how they would've stopped what happened.Until then, it's all empty nonsense
@BarackObama GOD BLESSED
@BarackObama @thesaddleguy1 टेरोरिज्म के खिलाफ जंग अब नही तो कभी नही।
@BarackObama we already have gun laws you twit. Just reinforce those, don't make new ones.
@BarackObama oh, yeah, like you have ever been a man of action. You're a lame duck, Barry, just enjoy your time left.
@BarackObama Please sign executive order to expand background checks.
@BarackObama your gun laws only hinder law abiding citizens not criminals. When will you ever understand this?
@BarackObama @AndyRichter I can hear the feathers ruffling at the statement that prayer isn't enough :D
@BarackObama @AndyRichter Alcohol kills far more people than guns. So why don't you propose to prohibit alcohol? Oh right, it didn't work…
@BarackObama the king has spoken
@BarackObama because guns aren't a natural disaster
@BarackObama @AndyRichter So go after people who are illegally carrying
@BarackObama like
@BarackObama I agree with you!  My cousin was a senior when Kip Kinkel did the school shooting.  I have had to sit by the tv all day!
@BarackObama @genesmith45: Backgnd check must include screening of social media accounts...used to prevent than to discover why afterwards!
@BarackObama I feel ya. It's like some day the guns securely locked in my safe might break out and shoot me. I had better get rid of those
@BarackObama @hungryboyfriend Words, mate, just words. #Action is what is needed. Gather all the guns up and destroy them.
@BarackObama and where were you when the un armed marines were killed ? People wake up! this man BO is BAD
@BarackObama so when the guy down the street kills a family with his car, are you going to take my truck? No correlation.
@BarackObama where were you then?
@BarackObama Enforce existing gun laws. Criminals have illegal weapons. How do you intend to end that?
@BarackObama good point LG4LG.
@BarackObama. We don't need more gun control, we need to return to traditional values. Liberalism is how we get to this point.
@BarackObama Feliz tarde
@BarackObama Hey putz, save the taxpayer millions and stay away from Roseburg, they don't want u there anyway.

@BarackObama Totally agree and when VW and auto makers made responsible for innocent deaths why not gun manufacturers of America? Bush Adm?
@BarackObama Guess we don't have insurance co's lobbying strongly enough for themselves, er gun viol victims, like w/ your other examples.

@BarackObama  When you take guns away from law abiding citizens, then only criminals will have guns, you are protected by secret service men
@BarackObama
@BarackObama do NOT impose gun laws against free law abiding men! Change gun free zone laws at schools!
@BarackObama Mr. President, change gun free zone laws at schools. Allow us as parents to pay for armed security, in example off duty police.
@BarackObama 
Chicago gun laws haven't stopped the violence @BarackObama! Clinton's putting cops on streets got results, as has your putting them in jail!
@BarackObama could also stop giving straw purchasers plea deals that put them back on the street.
@BarackObama can start by prosecuting the 70% of NICS rejections who are FELONS. AG's 3% prosecution rate isn't cutting it.
@BarackObama why not break down percentages like @StefanMolyneux did in his YouTube video
@BarackObama look into the statistics a little more in depth sir. People who have psychiatric issues usually are the ones that cause this
@BarackObama
@BarackObama gun free zone people!  Wake up.  Criminals and crazies go where people can't defend themselves or others. Don't enable tyrants
@BarackObama where's the "nobody should be targeted for their religion" speech? Christians were killed here & nothing from you? Hypocrite!
@BarackObama says the man who is protected by guns......
@BarackObama https://www.facebook.com/javonne.m.clark/posts/10205277518397258 …
@BarackObama banning guns won't keep them away from criminals. Same as banning illegal drugs won't keep them away from the junkies.
@BarackObama is my favorite president of the year.
@BarackObama You were complaining about Russia's actions in Syria? Who are the good guys?

@BarackObama Putin says he's targeting ISIS in Syria. You're saying that US troops attacked in Afghanistan...lies.
@BarackObama   igireet you
@BarackObama Please, I have been studying & fighting 13 yrs, I know this stuff, I live this stuff, please I care.
@BarackObama Please contact Bessell van der Kolk or hundreds of other specialists in area of violence.  or http://www.jrmurphypoet.com 
@BarackObama Guns are only a part of the problem, your problem is mental health services are abusive & psychotropic drugs are experimental!
@BarackObama
They will blame guns for now and then God later. They wanted Him gone. And so he left. #WhenGodIsGone
@BarackObama Parents and Loved Ones who have lost Sons and Daughters will change the law because of Tragedy. Now, there's enough of them!
@BarackObama How many "mass" killings have happened outside of gun free zones? It's obvious what we should ban to stop them.
@BarackObama  I don't want to hear it anymore about gun control when you make it easier for Iran to obtain nukes
@BarackObama so let's make schools safer. Don't your daughters go to a school protected by men with guns?
@BarackObama butt-muscle jellyfish
@BarackObama @POTUS @whitehouse I think it's time to change the message, instead of GUN CONTROL, maybe call it GUN SAFETY & do same thing!!!
@BarackObama: What happened 2 "Ppl shouldn't be targeted due 2 their religious beliefs"? Oh, wait - THESE victims were only CHRISTIANS #FAIL
@BarackObama its the most funniest thing I hv ever heard..U need 2 work on it...
@BarackObama The truth is, none of those laws make any difference to people who are going to break the law anyway.
@BarackObama I totally agree! It's time to allow EVERY SINGLE CITIZEN in this country the right to arm themselves to defend against animals!
@BarackObama @MrStephenMiller: @BarackObama time for constitutional change and gun control
@BarackObama 
The first 44 president of the year I Heard you in the news channel 15
@BarackObama Guns don't kill people. People w/ guns deny victims the right to life. Gun violence is a public safety issue.
@BarackObama YOUR RIGHT,YOUR PRAYERS ARENT GOOD ENOUGH AT ALL,BECAUSE GOD DONT HEAR EVILDOERS,AND YOUR JUST A DEAD MAN WALKING
@BarackObama SCOFF AT GOD AND HIS LAWS,TO MAKE YOUR SMILE..GOD WILL KILL YOU IN THE LAKE OF FIRE,YOU PPL.PLEASING,HELLBOUND IGNORANT ASS
@BarackObama IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD..YOU PASS GAY LAWS,WHICH GOD DESYROYED SODOM AND GOMORRAH FOR LIKE SINS AND T U SIT BACK AND

@BarackObama If we already have 20,000 different  gun laws and regs, maybe it's time to start  going after the criminals, not new laws
@BarackObama but criminality comes from poorness. Mexico has more tight gun laws and more murders then in USA - by half population
@BarackObama Completely agree. What about stopping your AC130 gunships from firing on hospitals then? http://nyti.ms/1FNndOa 
@BarackObama the first 24 days of 2015 US Police shot AND KILLED more people than police did in UK and Wales combined over the past 24 years
@BarackObama HappyAnniversary
@BarackObama Your speech was perfect. I hope the American people listen.
@BarackObama 
Thank you for not giving up on this issue. Surely America will eventually hear and respond!
@BarackObama @comradewong
@BarackObama  Nothing will change, there are too many weapons/idiots out there, so don't be stupid, each teacher needs to carry a weapon...
@BarackObama #SecondAmmendment makes it different.  #GUNSProtectFREEDOM  #SayNoToTyranny
@BarackObama - The notion that bombing a hospital filled with doctors and their patients is somehow different... doesn't make sense.
