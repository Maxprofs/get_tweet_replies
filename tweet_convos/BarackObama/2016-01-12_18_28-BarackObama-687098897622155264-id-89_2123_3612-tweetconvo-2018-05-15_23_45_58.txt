@BarackObama & retain them sir. Quality education from quality teachers is needed especially from a male standpoint. Especially AA men.
@BarackObama far too often I am the only representative in a meeting at the district level. Far too often Im the only one representing math.

@barackobama How is it possible that the Republicans can't even clap/agree with this. I hate politics. Bunch of hypocrites.
@BarackObama Indiana teachers should be paid more. Tell @GovPenceIN to get it together
@BarackObama stop texting, bro. You're on TV right now.
@BarackObama I agree. First step is to abolish the teachers union.

@BarackObama over here Mr. President!
@BarackObama we should pay teachers better too. What does it say when athletes make more than teachers?
@BarackObama Then pay them! If teachers were compensated like, say, surgeons, imagine the quality we'd see coming in!
