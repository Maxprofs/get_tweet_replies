I miss ya man
We all do.
Canadians too.

He respected women!
Not me. I support President Trump.
My president.
Our president.
Trump is my President, your President, our President
Not in heart and mind!
Yes it's me @MinnieBellW<same>@Willis_Hubbard_  Here's a @Twitter  "SALUTE" to First Lady Barbara Bush (FLOTUS 41)...Wife of our 41st President>@GeorgeWHBush & Mother to the 43rd POTUS>@GeorgeWBush__ & @JebBush ...No words can really ease the loss of a...
#2) ...of a love one, still we want the "FAMILY" to know that we too are "GRIEVING" w/them, & thinking about them in "PRAYER" & that the FAMILY is very much in our THOUGHTS. The BUSH FAMILY have our WARMEST THOUGHTS, HEARTFELT SYMPATHY & most of all "LOVE"
#3) The BUSH FAMILY grief is shared by MANY of us. WE TOO WILL SORELY MISS HER!  We could not have been more pleased to have her as ONE of our FIRST LADIES>FLOTUS 41 & MOTHER of POTUS 43. I just retweeted this tweet from the "LOVELY" Pat Fuller>@bannerite

I guess it's #TIMEtoTWEETlikeMINNIEbell too...  We may AGREE or DISAGREE w/our LEADERS at times, but that doesn't mean that we don't care about THOSE who do deserve our RESPECT. Barbara BUSH wasn't a POTUS but she was one of AMERICA'S "GREAT" FIRST LADIES.
#2) Naturally we'll think of FIRST LADY (#41)>BARBARA BUSH often w/great love & affection. WE join in extending our SYMPATHY to the BUSH FAMILY on the passing of a beautiful WIFE, a wonderful MOTHER, & a great GRANDMOTHER. Yes we know the stories about...
#3) ...this delightful & outstanding woman BARBARA BUSH. I never met her in person but I'm told she was the most truly gracious human beings, who made life pleasant for those who knew her. SHE'LL be MISSED, we know. I see another pic of her from @bannerite

Yep!
Thank you, Mr. President.
I still think of this amazing man as being out President.

Supreme Court seat coming soon?
Lol two of the dumbest comments I have ever seen
I love you.

President Obama is and always will be a class act.

Classy fellow
Love it, his avatar is a dead alcoholic cocaine abuser, founder of a neofascist website.
Breitbart ???
Yep

Well said! 
@BarackObama @MichelleObama your legacy is following her footsteps. Thank you.
For you Barack Hussein Obama .
This is a beautiful statement, about a beautiful soul. Elegant and classy as always. 
Thank you sir. Miss you so much.
Thank goodness we have a living President with character, class, compassion and humility. Whose condolences are sincere and heartfelt.
Whew, I know, thank goodness BO is out!
Indeed! She was a classy lady!
It’s like Christmas whenever you tweet!
Thanks for you and have a nice time in best time.

Eloquent as always. Reading through the responses I found myself wondering if it doesn't kind of break your heart to read all the heartfelt expressions who miss you and want you back. I do too. Thank you all (even the kids) for being our anchor. Our northern star.
Sup Prez thanks for being the last President of the USA
Well Said, Mr. President.
@realDonaldTrump , maybe you can take a lesson or two from Barack on how a president should begave and the code of conduct that comes with being the president of the America.
Sir this is exactly how ex presidents respond to life changing events for well respected families of our country. I thank you for your service and for trying to make this a better country the best way you knew how. Great Statement for the Bush family and I hope the same as you.
You will always be my president. We live down the road from the Bush's in Kennebunkport. Barbara on the beach with her dogs is a precious memory. Thank you for a lovely apolitical tribute.

Зачем ты в подъезде ссышь, паскуда

Thank you, Mr. President.
Rest in love Barbara

I just wish you would go away for good.  Bye Felicia!
R.I.P.
Thank you Mr. President
Thank you for being a true President. Everytime I hear your voice on tv now or hear your name mentioned, a sense of calm and nostalgia comes over me. You are missed.
Nicely said Barack 
To see how people respond to this man is truly a statement of his integrity. All these comments are positive. We are always looking for a good PM, are you sure you’re not an Australian   Thinking of the Bush family 
come back bruh we dont want that orange in office
Speak for yourself, racist.
"racist"
We miss you 
Speak for yourself.
If you don't like Obama, why follow him?
You a good man barack !!! please give happy birthday wishes to michelle .....We need you guys back desperately .You are both sorely missed.
Who is “we”?
Obama supporter response as expected.
But yet you’re here trolling....#CLASSICtRump
I know, it is weird that a former president’s response would show up in my TL. Also, you replied to me, fool.
An even bigger fool would troll and watch someone they don’t particular like or respect just to put their irrelevant opinion in their timeline thinking he will even acknowledge it. #HowSmartOfYou 
Yet you keep responding to my “irrelevant” opinion? 
hey obama, I know that you aren't the president anymore, but please join the #schwanzgang . You don't have to learn german for that, you just need a schwanz.
You are class personified Sir. Class! Peace.
Salute and respect what such a grateful way....
He’s a man with real ethics , only wanted what’s best for the country and its people, remember when he got to office how bad things were !
Donald J Trump truly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, you don’t and never did.
Vote trump for next year woowoowoowoo :)
And Obama gets an extra term woowoowoowoo
#qanon
