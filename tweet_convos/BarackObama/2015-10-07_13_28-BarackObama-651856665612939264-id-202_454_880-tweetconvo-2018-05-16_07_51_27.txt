@BarackObama The "fact" is, that W/O a constitutional amendment overturning the 2nd Amendment, you're delightfully feckless & powerless.
@BarackObama Mr. President, non-healthy mental problems in individuals getting guns seem to be an aspect. How to stop this?

日本も、自民党が政権を握ったままだと、銃を持ち歩きの所持を義務付けられて、国民軍と政府軍との文化を巡っての闘争になりそうです。もう、日本にはいたくありません。アメリカに亡命させて下さい。人殺しの子の清須市本籍のせいでビッチワークさせられた事も忘れたい。
@BarackObama With respect sir. All mass shootings involve a mentally unstable person. no person to pull the trigger no massacre.
@BarackObama Also, I'm proud of you. Your my president and I believe in you. Great presidency.
@BarackObama I just don't understand how it can be justified to fight tougher gun laws. The Republicans act like they have IQ's of fish.
@BarackObama Before you ask Americans to disarm first you disarm, then fire your armed guards because guns aren't needed.#DisarmObama
