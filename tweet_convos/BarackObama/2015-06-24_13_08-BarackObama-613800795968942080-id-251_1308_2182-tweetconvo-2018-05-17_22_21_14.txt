@BarackObama Your ObamaCare socialist Frankenstein is a BAD IDEA.
@BarackObama Obamacare changed my life. I have health insurance!!! I can see a Dr.! I get medication I need,--All at a low cost. Thank you.
@scriptyM @BarackObama Glad for you but I lost mine - cannot afford new plans and none cover my heart medicines -
@maxthedonkey you should re-apply when open enrollment happens again and talk to the reps. Also you prob. qualify for a tax incentive.
@scriptyM  with incent cost is $300 month - $3000 deduct - none cover my scripts I would pay over $6000  and still have to pay 100% of meds
@maxthedonkey that can't be true. Really talk to someone at the Marketplace.
@scriptyM  unfortunately I have and it is true - I am glad it works for you but it needs overhaul to work for all.
@BarackObama HOW DARE YOU SAY MY FLAG BELONGS IN A MUSEUM. MAJOR DISCUSSION NEEDED MR. PREZ. MAJOR DISCUSSION NEEDED ASAP! !

@BarackObama why are you hiding things from American citizens I know your a liar and I'm only 11
@BarackObama it's time we give more care to our citizens and less to our 'defense' budget. I don't have a lot of faith in congress

@BarackObama Yes, I agree. The American ppl who voted you in 2012, need to be punished! GRUBER said it best "the stupidity of Americans"
@BarackObama Lies, lies, & more lies. Tell the American ppl what this joke of a policy is really costing.  #RepealObamacare
@BarackObama all the  people celebrating outside for #Obamacare          #AffordableCareAct  guess they don't have jobs
@BarackObama 19 Mil next to the 200 Mil you screwed up for the 19 Mil.  DUH
@BarackObama it would've stopped you from robbing Americans of their hard earned money and just giving it out...at least for healthcare
@BarackObama I am glad the most vulnerable young woman I know working a $9/hr job can get insured thru ACA. Now let's try for single payer
@BarackObama Great news. #Obamacare justice prevails. Proud of my POTUS.
@BarackObama But because of Obamacare I have been left uninsured
@BarackObama thank you for health care! !!!
@BarackObama keep your swagger

Obamacare is such a great concept.  The Republicans are the biggest problem the U. S. faces.@BarackObama
@BarackObama I approuve your views
@BarackObama passing the TPP is an even worse idea.   The people don't want it.  Please stop.
@BarackObama sr.presidente boa tarde.O meu sonho é conhecer pessoalmente.
@BarackObama all of that has no meaning with TPP.
@BarackObama you were already great as economy recovered very well, and so on.

Way to think things through! @BarackObama, Thank God you're such an economicly sound thinker or we'd be in real trouble. @RickCo01 @CNN
@BarackObama can I ask you a question
@BarackObama I like how people think Obamacare is actually insurance. Education sure is lacking in this country.
@BarackObama   I love u
@BarackObama. the only reason I got a Twitter was to follow@ BarackObama
@BarackObama Obama is just roasting the opposition
@BarackObama Brother if you came up with a cure for cancer...they would repeal that too.
@BarackObama Already in debt from you lazy ass
@BarackObama 5) I have a family that's alive, healthier and able to set & meet goals because my life mattered to a man I've never met.
@BarackObama 4) Obama care literally saved my life, keeps my youngest alive & allows my older girl to pursue a financially secure future.
@BarackObama 3)& both of them would be w/o insurance as well. This would force my older dawtr 2give up her dreams &waste the work of 4yrs
@BarackObama 2)would have caused my 21yo dawtr to leave college weeks before earning her BA in science waiting tables2raise her sister(cont)
@BarackObama Still no single payer or fully nationalised system but it's better than the Republican option of; "let the poor die"
@BarackObama 1) w/o Obama care I would have died the day after Easter leaving behind my 15yo disabled child w/no parent which in turn (cont)
@BarackObama why didn't you just extend Medicare to everyone, including Congress ional leader, since the program already existed?
@BarackObama @ZenBonobo I think giving fast track authority and passing the TPP is far worse.
@BarackObama  my Neice used Obamacare and it was great she was pleasantly happy and will recommend it
@BarackObama Thank you.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama #WHAT A LIE
@BarackObama Free health care. It's better and saves millions of lives? People help people right?
@BarackObama la obamacare es la trampa montada para conseguirle el voto latino a Hilary.
@BarackObama Agreed. But the #ACA does need some fixes. Disappointed Ds not working on that. #ProActive YK
@BarackObama Hmm let's see, cost us TRILLIONS to maintain or only 137 billion to repeal...yep repeal still wins #obamabullocks #propaganda
@BarackObama  you messed up already -- no turning back now -- lmao
@BarackObama But ObamaCare is only a few years old, so it's ok to perform a late term abortion
@Alxandro @BarackObama How about early term inverted totalitarianism.
@RichardJHobin @BarackObama  The founding fathers were farmers and common folk, not corrupt career politicians
@BarackObama those pants of yours ought to be getting pretty hot by now...as in... Liar Liar Pants On Fire

@BarackObama nothing is done out of kindness in this day and age.
@BarackObama I go in debt more every mnth b/c I made too much last year, so don't get cheap health ins, but am out of work. Get rid of this!
@BarackObama thank you for Obamacare!
@BarackObama I love the no caps & no pre-existing conditions for Obamacare. More & more will become insured, if GOP backs off.
@BarackObama yes it would be terrible to repeal law. But Mr. President please don't sell out Amer. Families with this trade bill. Please!!!
@BarackObama ...but the American public is too lazy to stand up and fight for their rights, instead like sheep, depending on the politicians
@BarackObama as much as the GOP whines about the deficit, you'd think they'd realize this
@BarackObama therz probably $ 137 bil in waste fraud abuse in Medicare
@BarackObama http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/24/solar-wind-projects-could-cost-taxpayers-millions/ … How about admin poor oversight of clean energy projects #StopScammingAmerica

@BarackObama Absolutely, of course it ismr. President Obama!!!
@BarackObama doesn't matter what happens to the middle/lower class. As long as the rich are getting more rich, they will vote against it
@BarackObama this is normal America to the GOP... hopelessness rules
@BarackObama please mr. President, if it's not broke, don't fix it!
@BarackObama yes its a bad idea
@BarackObama what in God's name are you trying to do!? Make it hard for the next democratic president to win in '16 with this TPA?#bigunc47
@BarackObama we'll another goo moron has joined the announcing a presidential run. May introduce Bobby 'IDIOT' Jindal!#bigunc47
@BarackObama Not true will reduce deficit to $0 and keeping will increase debt $5 trillion & everybody can get insurance
@BarackObama Hi Obama
@BarackObama why would you NOT want a national health care service? We are very proud of ours in the UK and are fighting to keep it!
.@BarackObama The $137B "savings" was premised upon fucking doctors on Medicare payments, which can't happen if you want to keep doctors.
@BarackObama If spending saves money, why aren't gamblers rich? #Obamacare
@BarackObama just because people are insured doesn't mean they are getting the care they really need.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama #educate @america #reschedule #MedicalCannabis #medicalmarijuana  patients should NOT suffer. act now mr prez not perez
