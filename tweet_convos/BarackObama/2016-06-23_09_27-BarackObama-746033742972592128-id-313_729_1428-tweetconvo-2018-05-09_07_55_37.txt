I'm ready for a woman to be POTUS, just NOT THAT woman (Hillary Clinton - in case I wasn't clear)
Who #care!! I will vote for her!!! I have no time for #Twitter fight. I have to #grade my students papers...
Voting for Hillary because she is a woman is as sexist as people NOT voting for her because she's a woman
The candidate for the green party is a Woman.

Deportation was a lie & Border Patrol says so

yep, didn't meet top 10% auto admit cutoff that filled 92% of slots. Facts demonstrate her failure to make cut for one of...
She had better grades, SAT scores than almost all minorities admitted instead. SCOTUS institutionalizes more minority mediocrity
your claims aren't supported by the facts. Only 47 ppl with lower grades/SATs were admitted. 42 of the 47 were white.
Nonsense. This #SCOTUS ruling institutionalizes lower standards for minorities http://bit.ly/28TeOgU 
Notice that she doesn't mention SAT scores. Her claims aren't supported by facts https://www.propublica.org/article/a-colorblind-constitution-what-abigail-fishers-affirmative-action-case-is-r …
