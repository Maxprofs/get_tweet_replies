@Frank_Turk @BarackObama Talk about a Texas Sharpshooter fallacy...
@eric_sitton And I also like it that you think that 2013 GDP numbers are the best way to measure this president.
@Frank_Turk Where was 2013 GDP  numbers mentioned?
@eric_sitton Fnal side.  OEDC numbers from 2013
@Frank_Turk Uhh, those are average wage stats. Not net GDP.
@eric_sitton where do you think the wage stats come from?
@Frank_Turk Need I spoonfeed you everything?
