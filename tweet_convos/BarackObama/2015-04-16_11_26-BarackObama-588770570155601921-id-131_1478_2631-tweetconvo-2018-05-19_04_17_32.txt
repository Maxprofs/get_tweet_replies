@BarackObama Agree, we sometimes work harder than the men,doing the same job and we get  lessor pay. I'm a cna/housekeeper and my pay stinks
@BarackObama @cindy4540 not fast tracking #TPP is also a no brainer
@BarackObama I don't understand. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 covers this, doesn't it? What's different this time?
@lancewalton @BarackObama yes it does. People just don't want to go to court for it so they just complain.
.@BarackObama Yes yes fine.  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STAR WARS TRAILER MR PRESIDENT!  The country awaits your response!

@BarackObama not allowing Iran to get nuclear material to make weapons is a no Brainer.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama  I have been reading the comments here so far...nobody make sense.i expected an intellectual opinion.
@BarackObama If equal pay is such a no brainer why hasn't anything been done about it. Why don't you legislate it and enforce it.
@BarackObama you, sir, are a genius. I would like to swap Enda Kenny for you
@BarackObama and one day the White House just might practice this???
@BarackObama I support #EqualPayNow
@BarackObama #hypocrite u dont pay women in ur admin fairly... Please quit so we can fix America! #ImpeachObama
@BarackObama how about the houses stolen with #Hamp ? Give them back. #wrong #OCC #bone
.@BarackObama you know I'm a supporter of Obama, but he's false statistics here. Seems like he's just pandering to third wave feminists.
@BarackObama can't wait till you are out of MY house
@BarackObama ...have you started in the WH yet. .
@BarackObama US condemns air raids on Tripoli and emphasizes that the crisis in Libya, a military solution
@BarackObama Is it then logical to conclude that women earning less than men at the @WhiteHouse indicate no brains at the @WhiteHouse?
@BarackObama Ok then just do it
@BarackObama Uall just keep running on lies,  Nurses aide do not make the same as say highrise metal workers, & not many women want that job
@BarackObama fuck you Obama #votekirko
@BarackObama you are a good one to address "no brain ears"
@BarackObama @Jessie_Nicole26 then why do women get paid significantly less than males in your administration? Lol
@erick_morin calm the fuck down its just a retweet, Erick. Jesus.
@Jessie_Nicole26 that's what happens when he gets RT'd on my feed 
@erick_morin well no one asked, so either close your eyes, keep scrolling, or unfollow me. 
@BarackObama so in order for that to happen, Men need to quit work and stay home and let women work at a non home job.
@BarackObama Will it be when people work equal hours will be people getting paid no matter how many hours they work?
@BarackObama Says the man who pays women less than men in his own administration. #Hypocrite

@BarackObama How ironic of you to use the term "no brainer".
@BarackObama il a fallu 10 dix de preparation pour devenir presidente.
@BarackObama I'm a woman now can I have your salary?
@BarackObama I concur. The larger issue is equal pay, some women and men get paid more for the same work as a matter of negotiating.
Yo @BarackObama we're talking about the Star Wars trailer right now. Wait your turn.
