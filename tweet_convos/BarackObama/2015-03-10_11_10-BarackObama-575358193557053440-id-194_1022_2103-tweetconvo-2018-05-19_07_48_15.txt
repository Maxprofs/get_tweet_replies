@BarackObama Education is a human right, please make all levels of college free and forgive all student loans.  #FreeCollege
@rarianrakista @BarackObama NOTHING IS FREE! Someone will pay! Here's a thought..GET A JOB & put yourself thru school like MILLIONS have!
@OKTams @BarackObama so let's end social security and medicaid then
@rarianrakista @BarackObama So u r saying we just kill off senior citizens? SS is paid for by the recipient who contributes over the yrs
@OKTams @BarackObama we fought bastards like you for free HS education 100 years ago and won, we will win again.
@rarianrakista You shouldn't talk about @obama like that, he is our US President
@OKTams @obama I'm rubber and you are glue means you are a child or a boomer with early onset dementia.  Either way, I win.
@rarianrakista hmm...sounds like I'm the sain one here lol
@BarackObama Zero rates will create only slackers.
“@BarackObama: "I sent Congress a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero."#CollegeOpportunity” That's bullshit
@BarackObama Anyone who supports this is idiotic and clearly doesn't understand economics. NOTHING is free. You will still pay. #HigherTaxes
@BarackObama only a jackass would say that public high school is free. #nothingisfree #everythingisexpensive
@Giggsy_86 put it in bbc1 haha

@BarackObama @kristen_ples whose gonna pay for that?
@jdake14 @BarackObama I know you'd rather invest in a war but personally I think education is more important
@kristen_ples @BarackObama war has nothing to do with it.
@jdake14 yeah it does because we both know if that was the case you wouldn't stop and ask who was paying for it. get ya priorities straight
@BarackObama Thanks Obama./
@BarackObama how do you plan to pay for this? #PimpingForVotes
“@BarackObama: "I sent Congress a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero." —President Obama" yeah free my asshole
@BarackObama Nothing is free.
@BarackObama lets get the pubic high school graduation rate up and teach basic skills first #priorities
@BarackObama Much rather lower national debt of this country than to lower the cost of higher education.
@BarackObama presidente soy colombiano y tenemos una sociales con su nombre
.@BarackObama You're not "bringing down the cost of community college to zero".  Just forcing others to pay the bill. #ThouShaltNotSteal
@BarackObama Could you make another bold plan to come visit students @CuyahogaCounty  Juvenile Detention Center Weds while you're in CLE?

@BarackObama

@BarackObama just like health care
@BarackObama do the teachers work for free? How will the cost be zero?
@BarackObama  Thank you Mr. President for your honest interest in helping us obtain a quality education without putting us in debt to do so!
@BarackObama love u
@BarackObama Of you have the time Mr. President, I would love to talk to you more on college issues. There is more in addressing.
@BarackObama i guess more taxes out of my pocket! Why bother working.
@BarackObama how can you bring the cost to zero? professors need to be paid.utilities, water, janitorial. The sch won't eat it, but we will?
@BarackObama The middle class will pay for it.
@BarackObama bigger picture solution! Take my hat off! Wish we had a president that would make that optional!
@BarackObama not really, you just passed the cost off onto the shoulders of hard working Americans #StopobamasSpinDoctoring
@BarackObama hope it works. When it comes to education and reducing health care it never seems to work. To many people getting rich off it.
@BarackObama fantastic idea!!
@BarackObama who pays for it then? Who pays the teachers? Who pays for the electric bill at the community college? Hows it work?
@BarackObama that plan was easy.  STEAL from the rich.  Good socialist program.
Commie &#9773; Mints RT @p2t_tactical: @BarackObama that plan was easy.  STEAL from the rich.  Good socialist program.

@BarackObama No Nation is more principled & ethical & wholesome than an educated one.
@BarackObama #CollegeOpportunity those that believe you do need an education and life experience. You prey on the young minds.
@BarackObama #CollegeOpportunity you really think we are stupid don't you?  Cost = more taxes. You're a fraud.
“@BarackObama: "I sent Congress a bold new plan to bring down the cost of community college to zero." —President Obama” pls
@BarackObama lets make this for all higher education and you might see a return..2 yr degrees are useless in this market  don't play games
@bellabreezy_xo @BarackObama people can reduce their cost of education and transfer to a 4 year.
@nomadicmarauder so reduce the cost for a degree that is meaningless to come to meet unreasonable costs/loan interest for Bachelors & up. K.
The @BarackObama @WhiteHouse scrapped the funding for this "free" benefit, yet continues to promote it.
