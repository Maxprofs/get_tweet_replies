@WhiteHouse thank goodness someone sees the importance of keeping beautiful areas of land open to the public. We need space to keep us calm
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama but you went ahead and destroyed endless amounts of public and private land for a wall along the border 
@WhiteHouse I would think he has more important things to do.

@WhiteHouse Aww, you mean we can't frack everything?
@WhiteHouse Hi
Dear Mr.Obama
My message to you is simple, smooth,very consistent.Khaled Hosseini author of The Kite Runner are my book thief
@WhiteHouse More federal land grabs taking land away from the states.
@Caedda10 @WhiteHouse yea Chad, would the Kochs like to purchase them. Is nothing sacred?
@callenbales @WhiteHouse The federal government owns more land in the west than the states that are supposed to govern those regions.
@Caedda10 @WhiteHouse so what? When the nation controls those lands, it is harder to wrest control than if the states/localities were
@callenbales @WhiteHouse Feds have no authority to take such lands. States have right to govern themselves.
@Caedda10 @WhiteHouse Yes, in theory, but federal jurisdiction trumps state for any number of good reasons.
@callenbales @WhiteHouse Most of them bad and unconstitutional. The Constitution lists specific areas-today they have carte blance.
“@_cevd: @WhiteHouse Good,:-) :-) .” #jesuspost
@WhiteHouse #these policies do is create more hiding grounds for the drug growers. And allows the fed gov to use public lands as collaterial
@WhiteHouse  Cheers . more Mr. President
