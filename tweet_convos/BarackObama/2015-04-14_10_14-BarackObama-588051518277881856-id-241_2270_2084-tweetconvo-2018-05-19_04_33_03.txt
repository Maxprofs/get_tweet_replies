@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse what’s your proposal? Because the gap is due to choices women make, not discrimination.
The Paycheck Fairness Act for a start. @AsheSchow: "What’s your proposal? Because the gap is due to choices women make, not discrimination.”
@Cecilia44 won’t fix the problem since it doesn’t force people to make different choices about their careers.
.@AsheSchow Pay inequity isn't only about career choices.  It's also about transparency, about retaliation for disclosing salary, and more.
@Cecilia44 ok but none of those things address the core issue of the wage gap. Will increase lawsuits and help trial lawyers though!
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse Then we must ask why didn't Dems fix this when they had a majority in Congress and had the presidency? #EqualPayDay
.@tcunderdahl Democrats passed the Equal Pay Act in the House in 2010. It failed due to R filibuster In the Senate. #equalpaynow
@Cecilia44 That argument doesn't hold water. The ACA was passed w/no GOP votes, so it follows Dems could have forced #EqualPayDay into law.
@Cecilia44 @MeganDenise93 Dont know where you get stats using total woman pay vs total men pay, got to look at equal in all hrs, worked etc.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Same access to education, exactly same amount spent on extracurriculars. Maybe men and women are different?
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama when someone says Equality. what they mean is they want more. Never heard of equality activist returning excess.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama I wanna see this study. Im just callin bullshit on anything in it. #credibilitylacking
@Cecilia44 
That's a shame! We need to be each other's best advocate on many levels.
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse Americans know this is non-partisan. #MyDemocracy is committed to bringing Americans together #Congress  #EqualPayDay
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Now show me where they were at going in? you subsidize a cohort and blame the system when they underperform. #really

@Cecilia44 @_lexiemichelee men have to pay for dinners, drinks, etc. we deserve it.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Feminism is communism.  I never had a problem with women until we began legislating mediocrity.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama I go to court to fight a walkin in the crosswalk WITH a green light and allegedly red hand for the walk sign.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Equal access is not enough? we will make a gender spectrum to equalize this shit. #Dontcarewhotheyhurt #Clueless
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama watch this funny skit about : https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10152735169383851 …
@Cecilia44 give women chance too to express their selves
@Cecilia44 @geor94706681 I agreed
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama tsir
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama So where is the bitch that I outperformed in everyway and she got the job bc she had no chance to advance farther.
@Cecilia44 suck my ass
@cecilia44 this has been disproven by every leading economist and University. Next..
@Cecilia44 That will remain to be the fact
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Should we make a law that says it's illegal to violate the Equal Pay Act of '63?  LOL

@GlowingAsh @Cecilia44 lol c'mon give it a chance it's really good video
@Cecilia44 @GlowingAsh if this was true why wouldn't big companies only hire women to save money?
@The_Impaler98 @Cecilia44 because that's against the law? You can't discriminate
@GlowingAsh @Cecilia44 then why wouldn't the majority of workers be women lol
@The_Impaler98 @Cecilia44 Ricardo ask them not me. Women get paid 0.78 cents while men get paid a full 1.00
@GlowingAsh @Cecilia44 the explains why that is

@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Since women make up at least half the voters, it seems like a con job by men!
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama
@Cecilia44 Amen.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama lets take a look http://www.scout4apps.com/my-candidate.html …
@Cecilia44 @AsheSchow Give women the same chances as men, provide day care, fewer years away from work, equal pay for equal work
@Cecilia44 can we get details on the job titles? Or do we just want to assume that Men earn more “just because they’re men”?
@Cecilia44 Why exactly woman make less than man. Planning is the essence of every achievement

@Cecilia44 @BarackObama So are you going to start with the women in Barack Obama's administration who get paid less than the men?
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama @hey_antoniaa
@paaaatttyy  thanks!!! 
RT"@Cecilia44, (President) "@BarackObama -, #EqualPayDay -, #EqualPayNow.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Yes! Therefore, our only recourse is to prohibit the personal choices of women that cause these disparities.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Teachers' pay is set. That difference is due to coaching stipends. Why can't a male teacher get a job w/o coaching?
@Cecilia44 If it's so easy for employers to pay women less, why don't these greedy employers fire all men and replace them w/ cheap women?
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama where is that true at? Where I live most of the women make more...must be nice on your side of the fence..:)
@Cecilia44 do you have a plan to solve the problem? Also your stats are vague. Many factors play into unequal pay between sexes.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama I hope women remember what party like to keep women in " their place " and vote democrat in presidential election.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama none of the government's business..you can't FORCE a company to pay a certain wage.
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse thank u 
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama The easiest way to achieve pay equity is to cut the amount men earn. Is that what women want?
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama There are more women college grads nowadays. Supply and demand? Pretty even in the technical field--fewer women?

@Cecilia44 @BarackObama did you take into account the actual numbers of hours worked on the job and not just the years having the job title?
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama equalpay for blacks and whites
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama just drop two chemical traces on my city
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Need more effort to make equality between both gender
@Cecilia44 not trying to be cynical# but African Americans and majority of minorities make even less#
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama I call bullshit on the numbers...no sources.
@Cecilia44 
@BarackObama Sir
Respect
Mam @FLOTUS 
You Are Making A Whole LOT Of Difference wid every passing day #EqualPayDay @WhiteHouse
@Cecilia44 Well, we get lower life spans, higher suicide rates, and <<shudder>> Dockers. Surely we deserve some recompense for such horrors!
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama  Equal Salary/Equal Parenting helps the middle class and both genders.The key factor is that no one can discuss it.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama  Equal opportunity is for everyone regardless of, but not limited to their race, gender or sexual preference.
“@Cecilia44: Women make - vs men in almost every field 4Y aft. grad. Time 2 change #EqualPayDay ” #HigherEd almost ok
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama lets mandate paid maternity leave and watch those numbers even out... I bet the abortion rates would fall too.
@Cecilia44 The gender gap is a myth.  To hell with your gynocentricism.
@Cecilia44 There is so much missing in the information here. What are the amount of avg days worked vs. a man? Does this count benefits?
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Sadly As Time Goes,That Fight For Equal Pay Has Not Change.I Lived It,If I Wasn't A Fighter, I Would Have Fail.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama however the gap is getting closer
@Cecilia44 Only one bar out of 11 are anywhere near 75%, what does that same chart look like in hours spent in work?
@Cecilia44 This is because women take less hours and less travel positions for more mommy friendly hours. #UnfairComparison.
@Cecilia44 this is showing har far we've come they make less but not much less other then computer, buisness, and general studies
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama http://bosscade.com/c?r=rGUzTmTKd 
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama sometime make diff career choices/commitments family# don't want to go further on ladder. Why highlight now Politics
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama Get that same fucking graph and put the money paid in taxes, shelter, food so on. Move the prostitution money to the
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama That is because they are prostitutes on the side.
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama http://tariq1988.blogspot.com/2014/10/blog-post_9.html …
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama I wouldn't trust government funded polls, that's where bias comes from to push a political agenda.
@Cecilia44 Surely this history has to be changed
@Cecilia44 @SenFeinstein at whose cost? Who's paying for this? You,Tax payers? It's unfair to biz owners to force them to pay. Not your call
@Cecilia44 women are more brave, or at least don't adopt risks.
@Cecilia44 There are plenty of women out there that make a lot more than I do! What a person needs do do is make a change!
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama and also in the White House!!!
@Cecilia44 ~@BarackObama is #deceivingwomen to make a #phoneypoliticalpoint.
@Cecilia44
Even worse than general stat MT “@Cecilia44: Women make < men in almost every field 4 yrs after grad. #EqualPayDay ”
@Cecilia44 What if any is personality disorder of an individual to have cottonmouth
#arrgh“@Cecilia44:Women make less than men in almost every field 4-yrs after grad.…time to change that. #EqualPayDay ”
@Cecilia44 word
@Cecilia44 @BarackObama amen
@Cecilia44 @anildash what are the root causes of this issue?
@Cecilia44 Before you speak compare equal job to  job - not field to field. there is a difference.
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse Notice that this is sourced from a government department. I'm sure it wasn't politicized at all.
@Cecilia44, Your CHART doesn't show how you'd SOLVE/Correct your stated problem. #EqualPayDay is a distraction from your goal of SOCIALISM.
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse  Women do not get paid less. They EARN less.
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse Its already law. More gender separation propaganda.
http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm …
@Cecilia44 @brucepknight And men can change this!!
@kreisberg @Cecilia44 I agree, Jeff!
@Cecilia44 bet this doesn’t account for hours worked
@Cecilia44 heard this for years, chose my area of practice due to this injustice..I do not want my daughters to experience it.#EqualPayDay
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse Educate yourself you morons, the pay gap is bull, the dying on the job gap is not.
.@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse I guess the question is why are women worse at negotiating pay and/or why do they accept lower salaries?
@Cecilia44 @WhiteHouse women should work hard nd should to join every field nd Govt might to support women with equality
