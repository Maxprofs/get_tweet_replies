@BarackObama I had no idea that there was an issue with overtime. Are people getting stiffed on time and a half?
@BarackObama Name 1 time in the history of time,  when a country  has ever been "fair"
@BarackObama It doesn't work like this,what are you saying? What is all this stuff? These are complicated problems with complicated answers!
@BarackObama It is possible for one to work "harder" or do more, such as myself, in less (cont) http://tl.gd/nk6paa 
@BarackObama Absolutely, agreed!
Africans' don't know these things @barackobama
@BarackObama a lot of rhetoric, tax the low less...
@BarackObama so who works harder than our military because they sure do deserve more pay for their work
@BarackObama I'm pretty sure everyone that works in my company would agree with you there.
@BarackObama so should there be an ability tax ??
@BarackObama Así es!
@BarackObama Oh how I wish you moved on this 3 years ago but #NeverTooLate
@BarackObama why not lower estate tax exemption from $5.43M to $1M and use the additional revenue for infrastructure projects
@BarackObama ???
@BarackObama That is a lie - US currency does not account for human effort put in work
@BarackObama ...you bet
@BarackObama when America is finished with you, please come and be PM of Australia!
@barackobama The word is work smart, not hard and if you are working hard you are a bad example, and usually your shunned on.
@BarackObama... so the ones working smarter..making more, producing more should subsidise the others?
@BarackObama is it just for people who make over 50,000
@BarackObama WOW! You come up with that crap on your own? When has you and congress been any good at being fair? #Truth

@BarackObama thinking about all of the free overtime I gave away to my employer who doesn't care about me when I got injured at work.
@BarackObama I wish you could do something about injured workers who have been denied appropriate health care and lost wages !!
