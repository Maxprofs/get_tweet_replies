@BarackObama Best way to do that is to cut welfare off and make them actually work, you know what the people you steal from do.
@BarackObama so just how much free stuff do you believe a person is entitled to?
@BarackObama Arizona title 23 is unfair to workers without representation. Employers can hold employees money when work separation happens.

@BarackObama My country Somaliland needs Independence, so that the youth can have better job  opportunity. A partner in waiting

Look, I don't want to tell you how to live your life, but think about giving yourself a <mic drop> on this. 
@baldingschemer @FBillMcMorris
@Beer__Wolf unfort. mic drops on twitter are like soap drops in the big house @FBillMcMorris
Sometimes you have to throw good taste and survival instincts in the garbage. That was brilliant. @baldingschemer @FBillMcMorris
@BarackObama   The best way to fight income inequality is to grow the economy. You know this, right??

@BarackObama I Been Fighting Hoosier Politics Before it was Cool @stonedsociety
@BarackObama Me too. All inequality. But many instances so called, are not. And many ppl's definition is off, not understanding many things.
@BarackObama seems to me you are fighting FOR income inequality so you can feel cool then the 99%
@BarackObama Shut up and look this is hocalı
.@BarackObama Why is income inequality something to "fight?" Should a surgeon make the same income as a barber?
@randpaul @tedcruz @anthropocon @lheal @BarackObama No they shouldn't. How do you feel about this? #tcot #gop
.@jimdigs There should be no minimum wage. It denies jobs to people who need them most.  @RandPaul @tedcruz @anthropocon @BarackObama
@lheal @RandPaul @tedcruz @anthropocon Fact. Our economic history demonstrates more pros than cons when it comes to a minimum wage.
@jimdigs Prefacing an opinion with "Fact" doesn't make it one.  @lheal @RandPaul @tedcruz
@anthropocon @lheal @RandPaul @tedcruz That's true, but our economic history does. Unless you cherry pick your own historical economic facts
@jimdigs Your opinion on our economic history measured against assumptions about a hypothetical. @lheal @RandPaul @tedcruz
@anthropocon @lheal @RandPaul @tedcruz No opinion. Economic facts. Shown historically by numbers.
@BarackObama indeed it an ideal situation that I dream of everyday My President
@barackobama Oh really!! Can it be achieved?
@BarackObama ...and if the could have found a way to give you less as President... They would have... The most powerful man in the world.
@BarackObama isn't that what Karl Marx was saying. #classwarfare is so 19th century .
