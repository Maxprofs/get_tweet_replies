@WhiteHouse Why don't YOU stop playing politics with national security, and seal the border with Mexico?
@ksoileau @WhiteHouse  The border is more sealed then in the past, we have more border control agents on duty, get your facts straight
@dixietwo @WhiteHouse The flow of illegals continues to be a problem. I'm not sure how you can claim the problem is solved. Please explain.
@ksoileau I hope you know it's for the ones who have kids in high school and that are out of school who are actually citizens. @dixietwo
@WhiteHouse I forgot to mention, I'm not a 17 year old girl, but a climate and civil rights leader being targeted in Montreal, assaults, STM

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Tulevaisuus ja ihmiskunnan valinta tulevaisuus on ihmisen itsensä käsissä ...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama wawo beautiful house love
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The Republicans need to stop messing around you? You, Mr. President need to stop playing golf and do your job.
@WhiteHouse 6. Metro, also using focused ultrasound, similar to radar microwaves, to "cook" targeted citizens,

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama DO NOT FUND DHS NO MOR LIES*NO MORE LIES*NO MORE LIES*NO MORE LIES*NO MORE LIES*NO MORE LIES*
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama plays politics with everything then blames others. Approve Keystone and let coal miners earn a living
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
I. AGREE 100. PERCENT!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama From what I have seen it's Obama who is playing dangerous games with not only USA but the whole world Secutity
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Always have backed you, but I am a Jew & I'll never forget! Netanyahu was wrong, but was right too! We are worried!
@WhiteHouse 5. metro, the same, from behind store room walls, sheds,.., more recently from the ceilings of train cars when riding these,
@WhiteHouse 2. In public, shopping centers, you assaulted from back store, stock room areas,.., emitters under floor, behind counters,
@WhiteHouse The link with #Charliehebdo the British strategy, using new cornered arrivals, acts of terror to justify weakening civil rights,
@WhiteHouse "With people living longer, pension fund overwhelmed, causing the deficits, need to take action, older retirement,, balance.."
@WhiteHouse My guess, what seems be coming, using the Pension funds to balance budget, both on political agenda,
@WhiteHouse Lib Paul Martin used unemployment to balance the budget, I remember workplace psychological harassment, unable to leave,..
@WhiteHouse The Political joke under hidden subjugation, Trudeau is in place in case Marshal Law is needed after cycle,
@WhiteHouse I see the cycles of taking wealth, tyranny, Cossacks, butchering the French in Quebec to reduce threat of separation, etc, ->
@WhiteHouse The Public Safety minister responds with ridicule, followed in writing claiming no plans to legislate Police competence for..
@WhiteHouse Police respond by saying they do not have competence for weapon when given evidence of xray laser type assaults,
@WhiteHouse And assaults from satellites, now in Montreal I see assaults seem deployed everywhere, including in the Metro,..
@WhiteHouse They have been try to this to me, among other deadly cancers, aim for center of top of head during sleep from neighboring homes,
@WhiteHouse I believe my cousin in Yamaska was targeted at 17, and killed through xray laser type assault, resulting in deadly brain tumor,
@WhiteHouse If you are truly worried about finances then you need to lower the pay for congress and house..js
@WhiteHouse you need to DEFUND it and also the IRS and other bs waste of our money offices while you are at it..and take a pay cut..
@WhiteHouse The radar type, xray laser type weapons are for hidden subjugation, tyranny, "subjugation or cancer" homeless, #humantrafficking
@WhiteHouse #Paris2015 Gaining Momentum, the fact: the newly crowed defenders of freedom of expression weekened it while using xray lasers,,
@WhiteHouse Does weakening freedom of expression make hidden tyranny easier? Strange link to 2nd Amendment.
@WhiteHouse A well armed population deters tyranny, fear of population, so does freedom of expression, like gun control it is weakened, ->
@WhiteHouse Knowing they are deploying these hidden subjugation methods on population, law represses freedom of expression? Strange link ->
@WhiteHouse Hollande, Cameron,, newly Crowned defenders of freedom of expression, have law prevents saying "I'd like to blowup STM Metro"
@WhiteHouse #Paris2015 Paris, Brussels, Montreal,, are using radar, xray lasers on citizens, in Metro, have a law the prevents saying ->
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama we are not safe with the thousand BO let across borders & his threat to this countries foundation.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama No, it uis the democrats. All the know how to do is whine, those "children" learned it from you.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Serious? You are the one's playing games. All you guys do is divide everyone.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama No, its time for you to stop usurping the constitution with illegal edicts. YOUR the problem, not congress.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama so would democrats and of course UR radical cronies

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama remember when Republicans were the party of national security? That said, DHS is WAY too big.
@WhiteHouse I will do Solve Any fb problem
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I will do Solve Any fb problem
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama like democrats trying to take our own homeland security and our rite to bear arms
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama In my opinion, you are sacrificing national security by accepting terrorists in Cuba, Venezuela & Colombia.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I like how the WH also points the finger at Republicans. This is the most divisive President in our history!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama иди в х#й, обезьяна
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @Bara. 

ckObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama both the Democrats and the Republicans make me sick! Stop being petty an do what you are elected to do!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama   It seems as though you keep trying to shift the blame to the republicans.  STOP WITH YOUR ILLEGAL AMNESTY.
@WhiteHouse may be it is time for america to think of the people who are oppressed by their own country's authority. Like in syria, congo .
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The blame sits with your self serving puppets in congress & w/your self serving self.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Point the finger in the mirror & at your Democrat puppets. I can't veto something or vote against & blame others.
@WhiteHouse it's time Obama works with congress and stop the excutive actions
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama If your shutting down then stop the foreign aid!!! Why should Americans do without?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You think we r stupid? Everyone would b back paid just like b4. I bet Obama would still b paid.
.@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Please stop threatening "consequences" for those who would dare to enforce our immigration laws.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Republicans need to grow and Boehner needs to go
@WhiteHouse WHO'S playing politics?? Sheesh that's all this administration has DONE! We have 3 branches of GOV FOR A REASON. #Constitution
.@WhiteHouse No, #Obamacare Isn't Proving Its Critics Wrong: http://bit.ly/1BBbfo0    .....
@WhiteHouse @ChannelleJ I think its time for Congress to grow up. 2 year olds can accomplish more than congress!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hell what does it matter about the border u wont to let every body in any way #cant fix stupid !!
@WhiteHouse Its not just Republicans, the Democrats do the same. Nobody wants to work together. President vetoes it.
@WhiteHouse Obama is who wants to do what should be done and Boener should represent US THE PEOPLE for what should be done.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama personally I believe you all need to cut the shit and get real
@WhiteHouse While knowing xray lasers are used for hidden subjugation, gun control issue,.., and it is gaining in momentum, becoming clearer
@WhiteHouse One involves advocating gun control, similar to advocating gun control while knowing xray laser assault weapons are used ->
@WhiteHouse The massacres, like the arrest on 2011, #MarcLepine and recently #CharlieHebdo, one involves women the other journalists,
@WhiteHouse Now, I'm linking it to their secret police network, abuse, repetitive ideation of retaliation, guiding targets to massacres, ->
@WhiteHouse Recently I'm linking the recent resignation of IPCC climate change head due to sexual harassment to Paris assaults of #phia
@WhiteHouse I know I've been assaulted with xray laser assaults in Laval, Montreal, Paris, Brussels, documented these on video with Geigers
@WhiteHouse ATTENTION Pres Obama, GOP, climate change is a national security issue, I see problem with #Paris2015 and it's gaining momentum
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Nice try to spin the blame. Can't stand the BS that oozes from this administration
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama no one has the right to use terroristic tactics at the expense of our safety.
@WhiteHouse stop tethering  issues like immigration to a national security department!
@WhiteHouse @Parthenon1 WHY?   DHS keeps our borders open, does nothing to secure them, fosters'supports illegals to come into our country!!
. @FightersIntel @WhiteHouse I feel safer with DHS fully funded and not used as a pawn by the Democrats or the GOP.
@Parthenon1 WHY???  The DHS fights securing the border, hinders the apprehension of illegal - allowing  diseases once eradicated from the US
.@WhiteHouse that promised transparency refuses to cooperate with IRS probe http://bit.ly/1wtOI52  -
@WhiteHouse Wait on a minute vote to #Republicans ? National security is biggest issue...dnt play with american lives...
@WhiteHouse Terrorism is fake
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I'm tired of footing the bill for their lawsuits & shenanigans! @jxjs12 @janet_sistare
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama YES ALL BECAUSE THE LEFT AND OVOMIT THINK MORE OF ILLEGALS THAN YOU.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Literate thinking wouldn't.
@WhiteHouse shame on all Democrats and especially Obama for putting illegal amnesty before funding the DHS, and then blaming the Republicans
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it's amazing that they are bringing Israel president to talk about his country security but doesn't care about ours
@WhiteHouse @Peacepox you are all playing politics & are concerned more with your legacy, party & perception than doing what's right for us
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The ones who should NOT get paid is Obama and his entire Regime and all the spineless members in Congress!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Obama is the one playing mind games and is ruling against the will of the people!
@WhiteHouse and why is the administration causing a greater partisan divide in this country with tweets like this? Weak show of leadership.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse If everybody would wake up and stop re-electing the same idiots all the time, we might get something done. They don't care!
The White House 

　RT if you agree

Thank you very much.

@WhiteHouse Time for Dems to stop pandering to the CIC after a judge put a stay on the order.  Defund that part of the bill
