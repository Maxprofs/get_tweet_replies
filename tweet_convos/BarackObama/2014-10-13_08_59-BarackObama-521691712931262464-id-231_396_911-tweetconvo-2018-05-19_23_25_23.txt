@BarackObama do you always act like this?
@BarackObama and you made that happened too? Is there a gas mileage Nobel out there for you?
@BarackObama Fuel prices are up nearly 100% since you took office. Abolish the EPA. Build Keystone pipeline.

Hello! 
You must stop the Communist revolution United States my Country
Ruling Party lawmakers worry that I have go in china
@BarackObama @CarriWeatherwax To become even more efficient, we have to start driving cars that don't use gasoline..
Our electric car is great, and never needs gas or an oil change. I agree! @BlaineBershad @CarriWeatherwax @BarackObama
@AmyTidd @CarriWeatherwax @BarackObama Amy, we are seriously considering purchasing the same. Would also consider Hydrogen power.
We have a @NissanLeaf & drive it almost free. The lease is $199 & we make that up with no gas or maint cost.  @BlaineBershad @BarackObama
@AmyTidd @NissanLEAF @BarackObama We are definitely considering the Leaf, but drive too many miles to justify leasing it.
If you buy it, costs about the same as a gas car, and you get the tax credit.  @BlaineBershad @NissanLEAF @BarackObama
@BarackObama what about Ebola?!?!
@BarackObama dog in the yard to go from Chicago to Washington D.C. Curious being the first African American to run the White House woo hoo!
@BarackObama From Canada a little off topic sorry: do you mind a personal question?? Apologize in advance if YA do what it like being top
@BarackObama my dad
@BarackObama That means half the cars get less than 24 mpg. Get rid of them. They are fueling ISIS and the Koch Bros.
@BarackObama almost makes up for the giant carbon footprint of all your fundraising trips
Who needs gallons? #Electric  "@BarackObama: This is a new record-breaking level: In 2013, vehicle mileage averaged 24.1 miles per gallon."
@BarackObama  waooo latest news
@BarackObama  wow
@BarackObama WOW, that is good for us all :) I hope it will be still improving ;)
@BarackObama Measure is for new vehicles only, not weighted for sales. It's bafflegab.

@BarackObama hello USA
@BarackObama it could have been better Mr. President, but my wife has a lead foot.
@BarackObama Well, you guys are starting from a low base. Electrolyse water into h2 and 02; push that into the carb.http://www.free-energy-info.com/Chapter10.pdf 
.@BarackObama Average miles per gallon on bike = infinite!
@BarackObama if you didn't let gas prices increase so much this would be irrelevant
@BarackObama That's shockingly low. Just averaged 45 mpg in your gallons London to Manchester.
@BarackObama Thanks, Obama.
@BarackObama what a waste, when you can only drive 300 yards before having to club down for even less distance.
@BarackObama :-)

@BarackObama This is pathetic. Auto Industry is a Slave to BigOil, 26 is not acceptable in this day & age. Be honest, it's embarrassing.
@BarackObama Oops. 24. Even worse. With all due respect, we can do infinitely better Mr. President.
@BarackObama Yeah. Small Steps. What happens next week? A new fuel, easily available and not fossil related? #DreamBig #SmallSteps
@BarackObama @Eliomotors does it better. Lol
@BarackObama @truevisualpoet Bravo for fuel economy record high! #MotivationMonday #AmericaLeads
@BarackObama We shouldn't produce any vehicles for consumer use that are less than 30 mpg. This needs to happen now! We have the technology!
@BarackObama This is a new record-breaking low level of morality. 62 months of gamesmanship by PBGC 2 cover up #Delphi pension theft. Sad!!
@BarackObama  You are a pathetic liar.    America is tired of your endless lies.  Now, grow a pair and do somehting about Islam terrorists.
@BarackObama GREAT JOB ! SAVING THE PLANET WE'RE ON A ROLL AND DON'T BELIEVE THE POLLS.IN YOUR PLAYBOOK IT'S #1 WORD WIN N END
