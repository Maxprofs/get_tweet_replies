My nephew who has no job and no coverage has a $300 a month plan with high deductibles and high Co pays. So much for that.
I have to leave, i'm so sad..  I have to work on this paper, on Alep, to talk about them, about the life they will have or not.
love, make love again, laught, rise, enjoy life. We are here, now, we have to make choices. This choice make peace can be easy?
I know you are powerfull, in your life, in your ideas, I need you, I need your courage, tonight to make sure that people will..
I'm so afraid right now, because people are travelling, people are going to escape, escape the death....
Liar!!! Show me just one family that is covered for $75/month.
Most people???

freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. After freezing the account,remitted back to the United States,
contact Elite Benefits Group for help if in NC SC VA or GA at 336.355.1700
Big fat lie! Premium over $1,800 for middle class families.
$700 in 2008 before Obama & ACA. $2200 for same coverage in 2016 with higher deductible!  #lies #ObamacareFail
#StandingRock
low premiums have extremely high deductibles, like not having coverage. A bad, bad plan. Repeal & replace!
. Jwa  w ba bj
Many people can count on others paying for them
I am a compaigner of quality health care. Any policy geared toward promoting health is worth supporting. I SUPPORT OBAMACARE.
not always pleased! But!! My son had cancer and he has health care! Thank you! I was fortunate and had good insurances! Ty4 him
what we NEED, is SINGLE PAYER that covers everyone
hi
A HEALTHY CITIZEN MAKES A HEALTHY COUNTRY
DYK illegal aliens and Islamic terrorist can get a subsidized tax payer funded plan for $75.
What a Lie
unfortunately that is with deductibles being about $10k. Love the idea, concept needs tweaking.
Mr Obama how can you sleep?
not my middle class family, can't afford insurance, found $3000 penalty cheaper, but glad I could help others afford ins.
please, please, please! I want you to appear on Real time with @billmaher. The two of you in one show would be EPIC!
don't forget to tell everyone it won't cover shit until you pay the huge deductible. And the quality of care is piss poor
where are these 75$ plans
haha, mine now cost $600! It used to cost 184$ for the same plan before you ruined America!
who are these people? $1700 a month for me
おはよーミルク♪
where?  All I see is expensive monthly payment and high deductibles that need to be met before some form of coverage to begin
Much love and respect, but this is not true.
or $1443 a month for a family with an income of less than $70k
just more lies from u and the dems. I know u want this to b ur legacy but u need to admit that it's nothin but a big failure!
I'm recently unemployed and paying $400/mo.  Still don't qualify for subsidies. What am I doing wrong. Would love to pay $75/mo
Right, while other people pay what it actually costs. #Obamacare
thank you Obama for not doing a thing to address the police brutality you have failed us
REALLY?!?! Because my premium just officially DOUBLED since the "affordable" care act became law. Thanks!
we love you here in Nigeria. You are the best president American has ever produced.
Yeaaaaaaah....but that plan probably covers only catastrophic correct?  And only about 40-50% coverage is offered....Shitty.
How is a $10,000 deductible policy health insurance?  That is  major medical coverage only.
Ok. Turn down your plan and enroll in it.
false, even when paid $25,000 a year, I was paying $95.
awfully president in history
another lie..
instead of worrying about failed health care, you should do the right thing for our Military! Let them keep bonuses !
BUT,CHOE SUN SIL GATE CORRUPTION CONNECTION PARK GEUN HYE,THE CITIZENS DEMANDED THE PRESIDENT PARK GEUN HYE STEP DOWN
SO IT SHOULD PROCEED NOT DEPLOY USFK THAAD,IT SEEMS TO BE DANGEROUS,PARK GEUN HYE EARLY NEXT YEAR,FOR WAR, AND NEWS
HELLO,PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA,WITH XI JINPING AND PUTIN,PARK GEUN HYE, DURING THE EURASIA, SO KIM JONG UN UNIFIED AD CONTINUED
Diwali offers  hurry up, https://youtu.be/sZWPS4RtMG8 
In spain is free! 
Medicare costs more than that...WHY dont; I believe this BS???
you're a liar. Traitorous thieving backstabber
$75 a month? Even bronze plans are much higher. What can be done to force insurance companies to lower premium costs?
as Gruber noted "the law is working as designed" also he wants to see a higher mandate penalty THIEVES!!
WTF? Most people's premiums are SKYROCKETING! Obamacare sucks. Train wreck.
hello hello
the plan for my daughter and I was $900/mo!!
#GetCovered  it's mandatory. No insurance means you break the law by definition that makes you a criminal.
WHAT ABOUT DEDUCTIBLES?
. ACA:  Try appealing to millenies' social justice intetests to get costs down
what about those that can't or those that pay over $1000 a month for this insurance more doctors won't even accept? Do you care
cheapest I've found for my family of 4 is ~600/month with very high deductible and out of pocket max. Like another mortgage ;(
maybe you could lie before but we are seeing the price hokes now! You fail Obama way to go on screwing us
interesting, while my husband & I were searching (to avoid getting fined) the cheapest was over $300/month... &we're students!
with a deductible of $10,000. Lying price of shit!
Rumourly speaking, a individual applied 4 a bonus to help fund 6 bankruptcies legally than after that ran 4 president sounds made up 2 me
Atleast you truly have ability to pardon me he only wishes he could
Health status in every human being, God help you to each person according to the Christ's will.
yeah, with a 6000 to 10000 dollar deductible.  Plans in IL rose 30-40 not 3 percent the media is reporting.  This year they will go up 40%.
Who believes this liar??? It's robbing American working citizens! Premiums are skyrocketing! Obama lied to America!
mine is goin up 25% not down and it is surely not $75 your numbers are lies. Put your kids on this care and I bet things change
and you get $75 care. As we lower class people are thrown in to the trash you the elites get great care. Stand up people
Yes we have.
Unfortunately polygraph take our life insurance.
I have hope understood.
If u wr in our shoes what u should do?
Can't afford Obamacare.
stop lying

#ObamacareFail

you are a liar. Thanks for ruining my healthcare. You lied to the American public and you are now blaming others for your mess
honest to God. What world do u live in???  This is a COMPLETE LIE
if I can get abc for 75 dollars will it go up 17% next year approximately $13.00
more bogus lis and B.S. from you. Just resign and go back to Kenya.
Lie Lie Lie
I am a democrat and support Hillary.I hope she can make the affordable policies have lower deductibles. A $12,000 deductible is not worth it
#ThanksObama for the right to die while "covered" for #prostatecancer. Deaths are soaring #mensrights
yaa 
Health insurance 
Is very important 
Mr president of USA
Not me. I make "too much". The only plan I could find w/ a low deductible & adult dental was $512 & is going to $673.
is this a parody account?
obamacare the health plan built on lies by liars..pretty sick shit when the DEMOCRATS OPT OUT OF THIS REALLY GREAT PLAN crooked
If if if if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. Okie-doke? Or, maybe not? #MAGA #TrumpPence2016
yea??? What plan did the democrats choose??? Oh hell.that's right ..we the tax payers pay for theirs too and yours and your fam
good morning from Panama.
most equals 50.01%... you've fucked the other 49.99% like me and took my tax return because I couldn't afford the premiums
most people can't afford to go to the doc or buy Rx w/ or w/o overpriced insurance. #PublicOption
can you keep your Doctor?
bull crap. My daughter can barely walk &has the back of 87 yr old woman &can't afford it!  She suffers everyday because of YOU
then why did my ins. Provided by my company go from $60 per pay to $740 per pay? You are a liar and a criminal.
#criminalpotus
@HFA Rigging the Election - Video IV: $20K Wire Transfer From Belize Returned https://youtu.be/nUBrZItwVy4  @FEC @FBIWFO @FBINewark

BULLSHIT, YOU MIGHT FIND A PLAN, BUT NO DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL WILL TAKE IT. OBAMA CARE NEEDS TO GO. PERIOD!!! HILLARY PLAN EVEN WO
Your hands are stained with blood in Syria and Iraq? History writes about you
Lies lies lies lies Just over and over and over by the dems

ECONOMIC SABOTAGE is TREASON!  Arrest Fraud Obama/Clinton/Bush ruling Financial Terrorist gangs http://thejewishwars.blogspot.com/2016/05/burning-down-house-how-goddamn-sachs.html …
Not for us workin class in Texas. Thanks for trying Mr. President. The R's could care less about us working folks.
It's more like $75 per day. If you can't tell the truth then dont say anything. We are sick n tired of you Fucking LYING
I have no subsidies and I pay more monthly now than ever plus huge deductable plus insurer  pulled out. It's killing us. No way
What's hilarious is a lot of you actually believe this. Do a Google search on ObamaCare premiums. Don't drink the Kool Aid
Serioulsy!! U kidding!
More bullshit from the lier in chief
why do so many people I know say it's close to five or six hundred dollars?I tell them they must be doing their taxes wrong.
Tell us more lies we love it. What a dork.
we your biggest fan
@POTUS I hav opted to Florida Blue nd it costs me 90$ a month. Tats d min my company offers. Where s d 75$ plan ?
Big supporter of ACA until yesterday. Security Health doubled monthly fee paid to them. May not be able to pay on fixed income
"most" must equal single and unemployed, which isn't really "most"
what if I don't have a job
What a lie!  Obama is the best darn snake oil salesperson of his generation. Our plan cost has gone from $4k to $8k in 3 years!
Meanwhile, everyone else must choose between paying bills v. premiums bc we can't afford both.    #thisisntworkingforus
lol, what a bold face lie.   Nothing is free people
WHAT PLANET ARE YOU ON?
75 bucks, clearly your government Healthcare means you don't have to look at the real cost of health insurance.
hahaha No, we can't! 
And that is less of plan then some jobs you have to pay at some jobs
lies
Besides, why FINE your people for not having something they can't afford?
I make $8,000 a year. These are my cheapest options. That, and I have to drive over an hour for a OBGYN that will accept me.
,hi,privt entrprz profiteering from publum health care,martrial medcl must b art cost,cheaper to govt,as privt contrbutn to USA

Will it go into effect before November 8th?
I don't qualify for a subsidy, and if I did, @Carolinas docs refuse to take it. #BCBSNC wants $925/month for 2017. Now what?
wrong again Obama you lied once again
he had to come out of pocket $6000.00 to have surgery that he would have died without .......
