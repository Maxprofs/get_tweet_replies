@BarackObama This picture from Chicago job fair is why I disagree w/ you on Exec Action and Gang of Eight bill:
@lakecountydem @BarackObama dont worry brother all of us are already employee in job, jobs that a regular us citizen would never do.
@Hugotremebundo @BarackObama PS - I'm for complete amnesty, but only if coupled with full border fence and e-verify w/ teeth, not Go8 bill.
@lakecountydem @BarackObama undocument needs to be on the system, so they can pay taxes, the same you and I pay, we need a reform!!
@Hugotremebundo @BarackObama Absolutely - the best-of-both-worlds deal is true border security in exchange, not Koch/US Chamber Gangof8 bill
@lakecountydem @BarackObama  Border security is just one of many issues they need to fix!! And that only can happen if they pass a new Bill!
