@BarackObama @washingtonpost 

What about Louisiana's Oilfield workers?
Hundreds are laid off daily, small businesses struggling to survive
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Yah! Way to Go! ♤
@BarackObama todos os dias que penso em desistir, me lembro de você, obrigado por existir.
@BarackObama Trade is always bi-lateral (2 sides, 2 pov). Politicking aside. There must be mutual benefit - nobody likes a bully.
@BarackObama Thanks for raising awareness about #TPP, just shared your tweet on our #StopTPP aggregator http://rbl.ms/1ZfBAPK 
@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama @washingtonpost #to little to late
@BarackObama 
Bring American manufacturing back to the USA. Free trade good, FAIR Trade BETTER. No more made in China crap that falls apart.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost Every worker but miners! Oh , construction workers too!  Steel workers too unless you work overseas!
Fuckobama!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost @David_Cameron  And we in the UK deserve one that works for us. No to #TTIP 
#Brexit can't come soon enough.

@BarackObama obligado a la venganza. La injusticia va a continuar. Pero cuando en el reino unido hablaste fue una gran revancha del pasado.
@BarackObama Hiciste un gran trabajo al no dejar que el pasado injusto de la gente que fue forzado a venir como basura a américa no te haya
@BarackObama @washingtonpost wish you could stay another 4years this election is going to be scary thank you for your service

@BarackObama NAFTA worked really good for America. Democrats are all done making back room deals. Term limits is what the workers deserve.
@BarackObama WHAT CAN TTIP ACHIEVE THAT IS NOT ACHIEVED BY PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS - U ARE RIGHT - "US" MUST DICTATE TRADE.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost  thanks for sharing! You're now featured
@BarackObama his one of the most important part of the popular in the American Society
@BarackObama Just like any other citizen in any country
@rrich2312 @BarackObama This guy is a corporatist, not a socialist. Just someone who throws the  ppl a bone before fucking them.
@BarackObama nesesitamos tu alluda para unir a las familas obama porfabor.
@BarackObama You are doing an amazing job!  God bless you and your family!!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost @WhiteHouse How can I obtain a copy of the bill? We the citizens should be able to know what's in the bill.
@BarackObama OBAMA IS THE SON OF PERDITION AND POPE FRANCIS IS THE FALSE PROPHET. THE VATICAN IS MYSTERY BABYLON JESUS IS COMING
@BarackObama I like you, BO, but #TPP is going to destroy my already decimated community. Pls fight for us, who helped put you in office

@BarackObama You don't call any shots and that is why Trump is succeeding with the Neanderthal war-like electorate of America. Get offterass
@BarackObama You have betrayed us from the beginning, a fitting end to your presidency.  Remember when u were against NAFTA? #TTP #TTIP
@BarackObama IF OBAMA WANTS THE TPP YOU KNOW IT`S A BAD DEAL FOR THE U.S. LIKE HIS DEAL WITH IRAN. MORE LIES AND HALF TRUTHS.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost I am with you President Obama.  Let them fools elect Donald Trump and see what they get.

@BarackObama Funny he criticizes @realDonaldTrump for wanting America to be first. Nothing but charisma got Obama President.
@BarackObama ok
@BarackObama No Mr President. Such a rule of international trade must be drawn up by an international body representing all nations.
@BarackObama Together and with others we pray that Almighty God will bless and strengthen all that stands against genocide among the nations
@BarackObama @washingtonpost choc-ice

@BarackObama,Thank You for your tireless effort to set this country on a path of prosperity.
@BarackObama You want what's best for worker?  That's not the TPP.

@BarackObama Big business is writing this disaster; you're a sell-out. Shame on you! You didn't prosecute anyone on Wall Street!
@BarackObama Trade agreement??? So more business can move to a FOREIGN country.? Obama you are the DUMBEST Pres this country has ever seen!!

@BarackObama  hi
@BarackObama If we grant the argument that we need a Pacific trade deal, that doesn't mean that THIS deal is a good one. Stop the #TPP.
@BarackObama no mention of the fact that the #TPP allows corporations to sue countries over laws just because of lost profits?
@BarackObama shameful
@BarackObama worst president ever. Crimminal
@BarackObama no #TPP

@BarackObama @washingtonpost Remember NAFTA? That giant sucking sound was jobs leaving America. TPP will be even worse. #StopTPP #StopTTIP
@BarackObama Americ should shut up and learn a bit of modesty, after droning  so many innocent people to death without due process.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost a job can change a troubled kids life opportunity can change your outlook on life a strong America provides
@BarackObama  but what have you ever done for your own people doe???
#I'llwait
@BarackObama @washingtonpost American workers DO deserve fair trade. But this is NOT it. TPP will ship jobs overseas to the lowest bidder.
@BarackObama I certainly hope that you checked Larry Wilmore for the total lack of respect to ALL offended by his N word! An utter disgrace!
@BarackObama Agree!
@BarackObama POR FAVOR AMIGOS COLABORENME CON SU FIRMA.. GRACIAS.. AMIGO ESPERO CONTAR CON SU FIRMA
@BarackObama what about the World workers?... I wonder if the rich actually realise that it US THAT MAKES THEM RICH?
@BarackObama I disagree.Free trade is only free if the right of the weakest is guaranteed.Free people should give their own rules.Not the US
@BarackObama @washingtonpost an undemocratic trade agreement from a democratic president.
@BarackObama @RepScottPeters Why worry about that now? U had 7 years. Things must really be getting tight in political arena.
@BarackObama It's things like this that make people distrust the Democratic Party. Say NO to the TPP! Keep jobs in America!!
@BarackObama First red flag for me is Republicans are behind this along with Clinton who is bedridden with Wall Street.
@BarackObama We tried that with NAFTA. Yeah. No thanks dude. I support you on other things but this is a whole lot of NOPE!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost why?
@BarackObama never forget 9/11
@BarackObama And by America I mean Me
@BarackObama "America should write the rules. America should call the shots. America should never say "Islamic Jihadists."" -- @BarackObama
@BarackObama you are good man.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost . Morite negro cara de mono
@BarackObama @washingtonpost #NOTPP
@BarackObama @washingtonpost First thing you would do for American workers in 7+ years...better late than never I guess
