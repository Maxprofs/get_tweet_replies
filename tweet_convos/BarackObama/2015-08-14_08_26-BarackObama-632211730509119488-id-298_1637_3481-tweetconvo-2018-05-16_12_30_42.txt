@BarackObama you have to stop your police from shooting and killing incident people if you ever have any chance of controlling gun laws
@SneddonThomas @BarackObama your? Lol
@PEPSILUCHE and
@SneddonThomas he's not shooting people lol
@PEPSILUCHE I think you will find he has the power to stop his police force from murdering innocent people
@SneddonThomas @PEPSILUCHE If you were president what would you do to control gun violence in the police force since your a expert?
@Love_All_Brony @PEPSILUCHE that's unfair to class an observation based on the number people killed without a weapon an expert
@SneddonThomas @PEPSILUCHE More likely what "power" are you speaking of to stop the police from killing innocent people.
