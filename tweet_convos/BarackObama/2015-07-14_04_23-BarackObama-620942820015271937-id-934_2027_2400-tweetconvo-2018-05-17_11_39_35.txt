@WhiteHouse @POTUS What a joke. This deal all but insures the Iranians a path to a bomb. Might not b today or tomorrow but it will happen.
@rnad8 @WhiteHouse @POTUS REALLY? By loosing 98% of their enriched uranium & most of their centrifuges? Do you READ the deal? or just BSing?
@faab64 Did you read the deal?? Why only 98%? Why not all of them? Why should it take 24 days to set up inspections? Bad deal, period.
@rnad8 so you just make a false statement based on nonsense and run away from discussion?
@faab64 should be anytime anywhere inspections. Should not take up to 24 days to set up. It's ridiculous. Plus $150b in relief? For what??
@rnad8 "Plus $150b in relief?" DUDE, are you really messing with me, or you don't know $HIT about this issues? This was IRAN's money FROZEN
@faab64 A drug dealer thinks it's his money too. Doesn't mean they do right by it. Therefor u confiscate it. Iran deserves more sanctions.
@rnad8 There is no reason with an idiot like you. Go and watch your Fox 'news' and enjoy your life.

@PepA_2907 @WhiteHouse @DaisyBuddysMom Thanks for this nice comment, your compatriot's comments disappointed me from american's peacefulness
@Hos69shah @WhiteHouse @DaisyBuddysMom Ok, b/c I'm curious by nature: Which "compatriot" are you referring to?  To be clear I'm no American.
@PepA_2907 @WhiteHouse @DaisyBuddysMom I'm sorry for that, so change "compatriot" to "American"
@Hos69shah
Nothing to be sorry about. I get confused for an American often b/c I write in English.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS Iran's capacity for subversion and exporting terror will be greatly magnified.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS There’s no way around it. This is just a bad deal.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS We shouldn't trust Iran with a bad nuclear deal
@WhiteHouse @POTUS How can we trust Iran to stick to their word after decades of deception?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  Now, Iran gets to keep their nuclear facilities as long as they promise to use them to create power?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS ran has been cheating on nuclear agreements for decades. Why should we trust them with this nuclear deal?
@WhiteHouse "The White House" is a sham.

Tell John Kerry to grow his hair out like Gandalf. Make Hollywood movies, Red Box sucks.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS This deal will, certainly,  provide US with a strong foothold to prevent any country from doing the same.

@WhiteHouse the False ID ISIL can't be allowed to vote in Indian parliament until these MPs face a fair election with their true identities
@WhiteHouse @POTUS why we always lack reasons to kill these terrorists of Bangladesh, to maintain Humanity in world as whole?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS we hope US-UK would take some positive steps to give Indian civilians relief, as per their honor.
@WhiteHouse you are responsible to clear this ISIL shits of US+UK in India,similar to how you go to toilet and clean your shiits by yourself
@WhiteHouse or, transfer them to bodies of American+British.as its your technologies,being used to attack Indians or other civilian of world
@WhiteHouse i sincerely believe, if technology of US+UK are used by Bangladeshis in any part of world, their souls would either be taken out
@WhiteHouse US+UK are responsible for use of their technology, as,Bangladeshi nationals are mainly targeting Indians, they dont target US-UK
@WhiteHouse such a high population country, Bangladesh, member of Least developed countries, take them to US-UK-Aus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_country …
@WhiteHouse no country of world has right to destroy this country. its not your money in Indian infrastructure, nor you share subsidy burden
@WhiteHouse Indian Tax Payers pay hefty subsidy for people below poverty line,for infrastructure development of India http://profit.ndtv.com/news/politics/article-rs-51-46-lakh-cr-to-be-allocated-for-infrastructure-during-12th-plan-310726 …
@WhiteHouse @POTUS US allowed them
@WhiteHouse no one knew, friends coming from Britain were involved in conspiracy against India for years by using Bangladeshi nationals
@WhiteHouse its US-UK who deceived Indian civilians by allowing these False ID commonwealth recruitment for years, you are first responsible
@WhiteHouse these Commonwealth recruitment of Bangladesh could be successful in attacking India as no one knew enemies within, funded by UK
@WhiteHouse @POTUS these Bangladeshi nationals could be able to kill Indian govt officials as they were hiding within under False Indian IDs
@WhiteHouse Nationals of enemies,Pakistan+Bangladesh, occupying Indian bodies, are working as spies to destroy this country.under conspiracy
@WhiteHouse why we always lack reasons to kill these terrorists of Bangladesh, working for UK govt, to maintain Humanity in world as whole?
@WhiteHouse why we always lack reasons to kill these terrorists of Bangladesh, to maintain Humanity in world as whole?
@WhiteHouse civilians of India have yet to know that their defenders, govt-military personnel, have been killed "quietly". why US+UK hiding?
@WhiteHouse its also about moral ground, US+UK allowed murdering our defenders "quietly".now,will Indian civilian be bargained on gun point?
@WhiteHouse Bodies of Indian businessmen like Laxmi Mittal, Mukesh Ambani etc is also being occupied,hence US-UK must take immediate actions
@WhiteHouse if US-UK are controlling bodies of ISIL on government-political positions of India like Toys,similar to me, what bluffs ongoing?
@WhiteHouse you are responsible to clear this ISIL shits of US+UK in India,similar to how you go to toilet and clean your shiits by yourself
@WhiteHouse similarly body of Pakistani military is also controlled by US+UK, exactly like how my body is controlled in front of whole world
@WhiteHouse US-UK are responsible for anything their men of Pakistan+Bangladesh do in India, who are attacking India jointly at present
@WhiteHouse the ISIL can't be allowed to vote in Indian parliament until these MPs face a fair election with their true identities
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse these ISIL on govt-political positions of India are Commonwealth Placement by UK's parliament, their bodies controlled like Toys
@WhiteHouse US+UK may easily take out those souls of enemies from Indian military's bodies, you have put in these bodies, its easy for you
@WhiteHouse or, transfer these Bangladeshi souls to bodies of US-UK-Au, why your technologies are used to kill civilians of other countries?
@WhiteHouse if US-UK like any of those soul occupying Indian bodies,you may transfer it to new bodies of Bangladeshis,who all work for UK-US
@WhiteHouse bodies of military-govt personnel must be handed over soon, deserve final regard, Antim Shanskar as per their religious belief
@WhiteHouse Unarmed Indian civilians cant be attacked by a Foreign Military,who have occupied bodies of Indian military by help of UK itself
@WhiteHouse and even till now, the common public of India, 1.2billion+ people, are kept unaware of this crisis ongoing in India, shameful
@WhiteHouse @POTUS does this look good, these offenders of Bangladesh+Pak receive salary from Indian Tax Payers and report to UK-Aus?
@WhiteHouse Britain is hopeful to feed their coming generation on Indian Tax money, and using Bangladeshis nationals for this purpose
@WhiteHouse aren't these ISIL occupying membership of Indian parliament, the same people who have been reporting US-UK government for years?
@WhiteHouse sir, its part of international laws that a country can't attacked in such a crisis, imposed on India by the men of US+UK itself
@WhiteHouse @POTUS we want these offenders against the Largest Democratic Country of world, India, to be put in the wanted list of Interpol
@WhiteHouse we must always have a reason to kill those offenders against Largest Democratic Country of world, who can't be captured easily
@WhiteHouse most of them were placed on these government positions by Commonwealth Recruitment from back door, while hiding their identity
@WhiteHouse only NASA-US can control people on roads, quake-Tsunami etc, Japan is partner, UK is just an ally of NASA-US, none other country
@WhiteHouse its easy to kill them by controlling their bodies, if they dont surrender. US-UK govts control bodies of these offenders too
@WhiteHouse and why to worry much if bodies of these offenders is controlled,similar to my body, who all first report to British government?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS we can't lose difference between Humans and terrorists, who have terrorized the world society as whole
@WhiteHouse we will not accept 9/11 type threat on civilians,which is meant to help the foreign nationals maintain hold on Indian government
@WhiteHouse we will not surrender to threats. we will punish those who may threaten our people, we will fight with any threat imposed on us
@WhiteHouse the countries like Saudi Arabia+UAE, who were involved in helping form dictatorship in India, must be put with all the sanctions
@WhiteHouse mainly nationals of Bangladesh were used to occupy bodies of government-political positions of India,as guided by govts of US-UK
@WhiteHouse Foreign nationals of Bangladesh,offended against largest democratic country, will be not be left unpunished.it will be confirmed
@WhiteHouse Concept to murder Indian civilians to occupy their bodies will bring punishment. they can't walk away with these occupied bodies
@WhiteHouse @POTUS why we hesitate to make difference between Humans and terrorists, who have terrorized Indian civilians, backed by UK-Aus?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS why we always hesitate to kill these terrorists of Bangladesh,threatening Indian civilians by using UK+US's technologies?
@WhiteHouse we want border with Bangladesh+Pakistan to be properly sealed, the sooner is possible, with hope to see UN+US forces here soon
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Bangladesh is a very high population Islamic fanatic country. we are threatened that they may create violence
@WhiteHouse Current government-political position holders are working as spies of Bangladesh, entered into India while hiding their identity
@WhiteHouse while its a shame that US-UK watching False ID foreign terrorists occupying membership of Indian parliament, voting there also
@WhiteHouse until a fair election is held within territory of India, any new law under dictatorship is just a terrorist attack on civilians
@WhiteHouse the government under dictatorship has no legal recognition in world,no new law under dictatorship can have any legality in world
@WhiteHouse we want dates of fair election, a formal government under United Nations, and early arrival of United Nations security forces
@WhiteHouse British government is itself witness of partition of India due to "Great Calcutta Killing" etc, leaving a bitter past of India
@WhiteHouse they aren't from Africa-Asia-America,they are the countries India had bitter past,usual border conflicts
@WhiteHouse Mrs H.Clinton, these souls occupying Indian govt-military bodies are from enemy background countries, Pakistan-Bangladesh
@WhiteHouse we want civilians arms to be available to every home of India with subsidized rates,capable enough to face this foreign military
@WhiteHouse no countries other than UK-US used these technologies for years and we know that US-UK can stop any further murders of civilians
@WhiteHouse its technologies of US & UK ally,only you used for last 20years+.you must use your main technologies to stop murder of civilians
@WhiteHouse we can't do serious crimes in other countries with 50%+ voting in parliament of US-UK-Au,in unity? where will we head in future?
@WhiteHouse why no effort was made to stop genocide of Indian govt-military officials at early stage? what these people are intended for?
@WhiteHouse while its too easy to kill these offenders by taking out soul from Indian govt-military bodies,in same way you have put them in?
@WhiteHouse No country of world provides citizenship on border,No reason why Indian passport would be offered on International border itself
@WhiteHouse as helped by their spies occupying government positions of India, to finally de-establish India, a conspiracy of many years
@WhiteHouse Nationals of enemy background countries, Pakistan+Bangladesh, have entered here in a big number, under False Indian IDs
@WhiteHouse these Bangladeshi+Pakistani nationals bully & represent minority Muslim community of India under False IDs,to fuel Sectarian War
@WhiteHouse Religious unity of India,which these foreign spies of Bangladesh+Pakistan are actively destroying,their open statements confirms
@WhiteHouse @POTUS religious background of local civilians is an internal issue, which require 'religious unity' within the country
@WhiteHouse with occupying defense of India too, a nuclear power???? do we have any plan to take nuclear reactors of India under control?
@WhiteHouse as its clear, the way they have killed Indian govt-military personnel from back, they would do same with common Indian civilians
@WhiteHouse what US-UK intended to do in India?these offenders were behind killing Indian govt-military personnel,to occupy these positions?
@WhiteHouse and its the US's technologies, which are being used by UK-Aus, no other country ever used these techs. US govt may control them
@WhiteHouse UK-Au were involved in murdering of govt-military-political people of India by occupying their bodies by using Bangladeshi souls
@WhiteHouse Offenders want to hide to avoid punishment, we understand. but why its US/UK hiding information from common public/National TV?
@WhiteHouse and these occupied bodies now work for experienced False ID commonwealth men, who have experience on these positions for years
@WhiteHouse @POTUS you may occupy body of someone, but you can't get his/her memory- experience- knowledge- signature etc...
@WhiteHouse does this look good, these offenders of Bangladesh on govt positions receive salary from Indian Tax Payers and report to UK-US?
@WhiteHouse by using those Commonwealth men, who got govt-political-military positions from back door during last 20years+, under False IDs
@WhiteHouse Britain is hopeful to feed their coming generation on Indian Tax money, and using Bangladeshis nationals for this purpose
@WhiteHouse having killed Indian govt-military personnel by taking out their souls from bodied,they are preparing attack on Indian civilians
@WhiteHouse also, Commonwealth Recruitment on govt positions are helping nationals of Bangladesh+Pakistan to enter India by False Indian IDs
@WhiteHouse their bodies are controlled similar to my body. you may easily take out their souls, US-UK have put in these Indian bodies?
@WhiteHouse why we always have reasons to help these foreign offenders of Bangladesh+Pakistan, but no reasons to bring them on punishments?
@WhiteHouse Defenders/govt officials of India were killed "quietly", now these offenders negotiating with civilians on guns,backed by US-UK?
@WhiteHouse they still live in a hope that they would be able to walk away unpunished, while hiding these information from the common public
@WhiteHouse still this information is kept secret from the common public/from the national TV, as they know that common public will revolt
@WhiteHouse hence its clear that dictatorship was formed to help these foreign nationals on govt-political avoid death penalty somehow
@WhiteHouse @POTUS they first need to be an "Indian Citizen" for these government-political positions as per The 'Constitution' of India,
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals on government-political positions, while hiding true identity, are well compared to him http://images.indiatvnews.com/mainnational/IndiaTve44a19_kasab.jpg …
