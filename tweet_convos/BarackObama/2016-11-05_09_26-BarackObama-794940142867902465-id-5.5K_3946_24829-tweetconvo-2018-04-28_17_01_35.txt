@BarackObama AFFORDABLE? Who the hell are you trying to joke? Our insurance has gone up I've 76% since "Obama Care"! Worst President!
slower rate than it would've without ACA
to even imply that is pure insanity. Go take your medication for sure.
rates were increasing at 30% per year prior to aca. Now the growth slowed to 21% per year
that is a lie
you poor fool. Good luck to you. You're gonna need it
when you have actual facts and not Speculations, then you can bring the facts. You have absolutely no facts
@BarackObama U have created turmoil 4 8 yrs & u want ppl 2 like u? Now ur creating WW111! U resemble Satan! Go away!
@BarackObama Yeah my daughter loves trying to pay 535.00 a month for insurance for herself and one child.
Obama quadrupled mine. Trump can stop it from rising but our current premiums will not drop. Unless we change plans.
The most failed president of the United States
The middle-east turned to blood
are you happy????
you can blame Bush/Cheney/Halliburton for that shit pal
@BarackObama I didn't make enough money to qualify for the ACA. I'm a student w/job in GA. WUWT? You forgot us
you should've talked to our idiot gov then and got him to expand medicaid
Sheriff Clarke : For 8 Years Obama Has Rubbed White People's Nose in the Stain of Slavery
Clarke needs to concentrate on stopping inmates from dying of dehydration in his jails

Obama and dems think they own blacks! They own no one! Blacks can make their own decisions!
Name one think Obama has done to improve the lives of blacks. Just one!
Well perhaps there's one. Sadly black unemployment and workforce participation is awful. Not great!
@BarackObama hate to say it but finna get repealed
@BarackObama But it's not.
give up the big lie
Great plan but NYS Seniors are screwed

You really want to hype your biggest failure? THE biggest failure of any president in the history of this country?
You sir broke your oath to protect us. Unfit and you turn over codes. You sir allowed a madman to seize control. Resign.
@BarackObama Thanks to the Affordable Care Act millions of Americans LOST their freaking coverage. Your lies are being exposed tonight!

@blackrepublican @OFA @BarackObama no more #altright crap #NeverTrump #DumpTrump #nomoreraceism
and thanks for the kind words, I still dont like trump but he won & I hope he does a great job but he needs to tone it down
he should of been that way from the start and he wouldn't have turned off numerous moderate voters
with Obamacare, which I was against, he can't just end then 20 million people lose insurance in one day
people can't afford 50% increases in premiums. Bankruptcy will be very high with Hillary
50%? My aunt is paying almost 3 times what she used to when Obamacare was put in place.
Factually iincorect! It is the greed of health insurance company's and BIG pharma. The corporate greed is unbelievable and must be stopped!
and if it weren't for obamacare, they wouldn't be able to do it.
Wrong, Insurance companies  set their  own Prices. They got millions of new people signed  up, so they get all that premium. Plus raise COST
A socialist law in a capitalist country. U think Obama is idiot, or genius?
@BarackObama REALLY? Still paying $10,000 bill. Former insurance would have cost $50 copay. Didn't get to keep our insurance. #MAGA
@BarackObama A Message To #Trump Supporters Who Attacked Me and My Letter To #Hillary Clinton | People's Court

Another lie from a delusional narcissist
@BarackObama are you smoking crack. My insurance went from 700 per month to 2100 -#DonaldTrump

@BarackObama Dilusional
@BarackObama whatever you smoking, it's some good shit. My coverage is way more expensive and worse.
Because of you we have Trump. Had you & yr Establishment & Clinton been decent people we would now have Sanders as Pres!
Sir!I voted for u 3x( including primaries 08);I disagree;nothing affordable about Obamacare.Only good re pre-existence.
Coverage is expensive & unaffordable. Ppl buy it under pain of penalties. Good only on paper not for actual treatement.
@BarackObama  not! Thanks to AHC, at 63 years old Bronze coverage is $822 a mo with $6850 deductable, Im without insurance because AHC.
