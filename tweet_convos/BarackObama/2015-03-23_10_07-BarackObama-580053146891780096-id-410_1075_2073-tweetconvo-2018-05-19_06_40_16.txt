#BetterWithObamacare,#Obamacare: a historical achievement by 
@BarackObama & his democrats agst anti-social tricks of Republican’s “#GOP”
“#GOP” agst #Obamacare pretending private insurance is cheaper but in fact contributes2 $716 bn private profits #ACA http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/14/romneys-right-obamacare-cuts-medicare-by-716-billion-heres-how/ …
+#Obamacare schützt auch Arme, aber berücksichtigt zu wenig, dass Gesundheitsfürsorge auch Kontrolle erfordert: „Ein einfacher Arztbesuch kostet heute die Amerikaner rund dreimal so viel wie in Kanada,Medikamente oft das Zehnfache der Preise in DE oder GB“
+Die folgende Doku v, Sandra Ratzow zeigt passend dazu u.a. 4-köpfige Familie mit ca.900$ mtl. PKV-Beitrag bei 10.000 $ jährl. Selbstbeteiligung +800$ mtl. Raten für Arztrechnungen – nach #Obamacare & mediz. Sozialhilfe & Medikamenten-Tourismus nach Canada https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6sgvh8RyIU …
+Aber Medikamenten-Kauf im Ausland wurde kriminalisiert & WucherPreise unterstützt dank der Pharma-#Lobby-Millionen, die auf diese Weise durch &für Politiker abgezockt werden, wie es in Deutschland bei den Parteien zur Umverteilung nach oben auch geschieht https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/10/pharmaceutical-industry-under-scrutiny-for-prices-has-history-of-big-political-wins/ …
+Mit [pharmaindustrie lobby in ministerien (CDU FDP)] findet man zahllose Treffer, darunter http://www.bpb.de/politik/innenpolitik/gesundheitspolitik/200658/lobbyismus-in-der-gesundheitspolitik?p=all … & https://lobbypedia.de/wiki/Lobbyisten_in_Ministerien … &
+Even Barak Obama failed under pressure 2end this corruption against average patients: “He signed the Affordable Care Act [#Obamacare] into law in 2010 without provisions allowing re-importation of drugs or giving Medicare the ability to negotiate prices” https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/10/pharmaceutical-industry-under-scrutiny-for-prices-has-history-of-big-political-wins/ …
+Whilst US drug prices are exploding by corruptive lobbying, physician compensations in the US are also much higher than in Canada (1 Can-$ = now 0,66€) after all deductible expenses i.e. also after insurance, before income taxeshttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/how-much-are-canadian-doctors-paid/article7750697/ … &https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/compensation-2017-overview-6008547#2 …

@BarackObama and 20 million lost their health insurance because of this......
@BarackObama "thanks to people like you."  WRONG! I did vote for Obama and I do not approve of the Affordable Care Act.

@BarackObama please leave office early.

@BarackObama that's great, but when you penalize people for not signing up, is it really an accomplishment?
"But what about robots like me?" @BarackObama

"I'd like to get covered.  Covered in poop!!!"

It was luck...
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama Yanni to start drug testing all these people on welfare

@BarackObama
@BarackObama Appreciate the effort, but it was so deeply compromised as to be only a small drop in the bucket compared to what is needed.
