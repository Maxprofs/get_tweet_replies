@BarackObama I would definitely add my name if I was living in the USA. I'm from France but I totally support the fight. NO MORE GUNS
@demeko96. Salut,  tu es contre Barack Obama ?
@precyluc ni pour ni contre, je constate que beaucoup de choses vont de travers aux EUA et que les issues sont difficiles à dégager
@demeko96 mais qu'est-ce que toi tu peux proposer ?  Ma chère Mélanie
@precyluc Il me faudrait bien plus d'expérience et d'informations pour avoir la prétention de trouver des solutions. ;-)
@precyluc La "culture" des armes est ancrée dans l'histoire des EUA. À part les interdire tout bonnement sur les 50 États.....
@demeko96 @precyluc Aren't you glad our soldiers were on train when terrorist started loading assault rifle? Thought those were illegal? 
@ozarklady76 @precyluc of course we are. But they are soldiers ;-)
@AndruwSmith @BarackObama I for one don't like the idea that only the federal gov has the weapons... That is what I call a dictatorship
There are only 5 million members of the NRA, the other 315 million people in America should have a much more valued voice.

@BarackObama
@DrHawk12 @BarackObama it's all about the $$. Just like the 1%. It's disgusting.
@kcoby2 @DrHawk12 @BarackObama Look at the bright side. At least the NRA doesn't get taxpayer money like Planned Parenthood
@scribeofsolomon @DrHawk12 @BarackObama I don't have a problem taxpayer dollars going to @PPFA. It provides healthcare for millions of woman
@kcoby2 @DrHawk12 @BarackObama @PPFA How about taxpayer dollars for the NRA? They've provided gun safety for millions of people
@scribeofsolomon @DrHawk12 @BarackObama @PPFA great idea...kind of like Phillip Morris, selling the problem and the solution? #racket
@BarackObama we need to investigate The Law enforcement  and get Loyal uncorrupted Police Officers out on the Streets.
#BlackOnBlack violence/murder is more prevalent than any such #PoliceBrutality n USA, so #keepitreal @kiona123! @BarackObama @SheriffClarke
@learjetter @kiona123 @BarackObama @SheriffClarke 
One bad cop does not make a corrupt police state. 99.9% of cops are dedicated & devoted.
@PalmettoGunLthr @jstines3 @learjetter @kiona123 @BarackObama If you resist arrest you're going to be treated accordingly as you should be!
@JustKate038 @PalmettoGunLthr @jstines3 @learjetter @kiona123 @BarackObama Actual Capital Punishment 4 the worst Thugs&more Guns2 stop Thugs
@PatriotKevinMO @JustKate038 @jstines3 @learjetter @kiona123 @BarackObama
& get the lawyers under control-too many thugs walking away free.
@PalmettoGunLthr  3 strikes 1st time 30days,1 yr probation; 2nd time 1yr hard labor, 5 yr prob; 3rd time, 3yr hard labor, 5p; 4th time death
@JustKate038 depending on the offense. That would work for drugs. Violent crimes should be much tougher.
@BarackObama give everybody a gun....
@BarackObama Taking away guns from everyone is like punishing an entire class for the doings of one individual. Reminds me of my high school
@BarackObama where is peace
@BarackObama THERES MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THAT DOSE NOT WANT YOUR KIND OF GUN CONTROL

@BarackObama Both major US political parties cater to special interest groups! The U.S. Constitution is nonpartisan!
@BarackObama guns don't kill people, people do.
@bad_gorillaa what they do with their guns is on them. I live in the US. He's talking about taking guns from us here not there.
@bad_gorillaa can still get them because criminals do not obey laws. So that would leave good people defenseless.
@bad_gorillaa no. They usually get them illegally. Most are stolen from legal owners.
@BarackObama The problem is not for Congress. Culture and individuals must believe human beings have VALUE and act on this principle #WeAre

@BarackObama why don't you get the guns out of the hands of all democratic cities... That's a good start
@BarackObama If it wasn't for guns there would not be a United States......
@BarackObama why would you want to take away my guns if I never committed a crime with them? Gun laws won't stop criminals from getting them

@BarackObama Using a rep payee doesn't mean you're incompetent, it could mean that you have dyslexia or other minor problem.
@BarackObama Using the Social Security Admin. to declare people using rep payees as incompetent to own guns is incompetent.
@BarackObama add my name to the people who know that if you do that then the number of non gun related crimes will increase
@BarackObama I'm from Japan,and we general citizens don't have guns. We can live without guns. So can you!

@BarackObama Obama's gun control is aimed at law abiding gun owners vs the criminals who ignore laws.
@BarackObama is a gunrunner. He's fast & furious 2 give guns 2 Mexico & overseas rebels. Try creating jobs so people have hope vs hate/envy.
@BarackObama Something Really Must Be Done About Gun Control.

@BarackObama @Marina_Sirtis Criminals don't buy guns through legal channels. Run background checks before selling someone a weapon. 1/2
@BarackObama @Marina_Sirtis Don't take away the rights of law abiding citizens out of fear. Criminals will still have guns either way. 2/2
