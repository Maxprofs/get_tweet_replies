Thank you very much

@BarackObama
@BarackObama This is what America is about.
@BarackObama Пародия на мужчину...!!!
@BarackObama And all that sets aside the ridiculousness of a notion like 'winning' the future, or the planet - grow up.
@BarackObama The 'We' you are speaking about is not the working class that would be ruined by another trade agreement. But you knew that.
@BarackObama. Do u like uptowon funk
@BarackObama @tkdmike Got to have strategic trade agreements in a 21st c. global economy. Protectionism leads 2 irrelevancy.
@BarackObama WINNING THE FUTURE DEPENDS ACCORDING OPPORTUNITES FOR ENTREPRENEURS, INVESTORS, MATERIAL WITH EARNINGS, EMPLOYMENT CAPABILITIES
@BarackObama great quote, but what are we doing as a nation to help do this when we have trillions in compounding debt?
@BarackObama yes we do have to make sure we win the future
@BarackObama we have to stay strong
@BarackObama  hahaha, i don't think so
@BarackObama what a tin-eared dog's breakfast of nationalistic hooey. And that's coming from someone who'd vote for you a 3rd time.
@BarackObama love all that you do.
@BarackObama love all you do
@BarackObama: "We want to make sure we win the future. That's what America is about." —President Obama
@BarackObama ok
@BarackObama Then you had better take radical Islam as a serious threat. Trade agreement will not be worth anything if the world is burning.
@BarackObama 
America should be part of the WORLD, 
Not trying to be on the top of the World
That way doesn't WORK
@BarackObama Really?  You're out of touch, too busy shouting childish platitudes and trying to act like you know what you're doing.

@BarackObama  Great. But maybe not at the expense of others?Have some respect for other countries who suffered a lot during The II World War
@BarackObama You and what you represent are the poster child for the exact opposite of what we want for America and our future #tcot #CTOT
@BarackObama If you spread the value & the meaning of the freedom statue that you have in New York all over the world.. believe me you will

@BarackObama nationalism is stupid. False sense of pride by being born in a country. I'm about HUMANS winning the future, not just the US
@BarackObama you can win future in two ways only.. justice all over the world OR be the emperor of the world by force
@BarackObama  Mr Obama pleas look at Somaliland`s case for recognition, After 24 years of Democracy we deserve that.We are stuck in limbo.
@BarackObama 
Mr. President, if there is a winner there is a looser. Who do you propose that will be?
@BarackObama PLEASE distance yourself from the Clintons, undeserving of your support!

@BarackObama  En la franja de 45 a 54 años, el porcentaje no llega al 12%. El 88% restante se siente interesado por el el fútbol.
@BarackObama I couldn't be more ambiguous, could I?  #obamastyle #tcot

No one will read this, but:
In the future, American police will be powerless to make an arrest without a 9-11 call.
