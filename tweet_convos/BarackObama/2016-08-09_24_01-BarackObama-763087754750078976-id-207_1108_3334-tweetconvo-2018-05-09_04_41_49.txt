You Barry, are unprecedented and unacceptable.

not unprecedented and very acceptable to me! Maybe November if Hillary wins
@OFA Senate leaders are saving my country from more liberal foolishness. Put your big boy pants on and quit whining.
stop tpp you corporate shill #oligarchy
@SteveScalise do your job.
how about not unprecedented at all?
No. It is not done in a lame duck situation.
unprecedented?
it's part of the democratic process sir.  Checks and balances.  The people voted congress in just like they voted you in.
Meanwhile your funding terrorist countries. Which is worst? $400 mil to Iran or blocking a judge? I think I know.
they should confirm him before Dems own the house and senate too. Gonna be a rough election for them!
@OFA is totally acceptable. Ask ur buddy Harry Reid.
ppl should be really mad about this they wouldn't get away with that here!
PLEASE ADD YOUR NAME!!!
I'm going to miss you and your family Mr. President.
Mr.President can the Senate and Congress be sued for obstructing justice?
rr legend ,history maker enjoy your next job
#bidenrule good for u good for next REAL Pres
@OFA the govt is waging a dishonest cowardly war against its own citizens this is unacceptable #EndTheDrugWar try #Liberty
And they wonder why they are being dissed by so many. This type of attitude keeps USA in quagmire of discontent and misery.

Mr. President, U prosecute your adversaries & protect your friends.

Iran humiliates Obama with footage of $400 million ransom for hostages https://www.jihadwatch.org/2016/08/iran-humiliates-obama-with-footage-of-400-million-ransom-for-hostages …
POTUS & HRC should threaten to withdraw nomination if HRC wins, If they don't move on Garland before the elections
Your unacceptable
the precedent doesn't matter. They are setting it every day they don't act. You should have worked more closely with Congress.
great news muslem.
@OFA Republicans do your job!!!!!!!
Excellent work President!!
Well get them out in November.
@OFA Call a spade what it is. As an outsider with a fresh pair of eyes, what is happening is color coded. That's how I see it.
@OFA yaşasın recep tayyip Erdoğan yenilen hep siz olacaksınız kafirler zafer türklerinnnn
dilerim ALLAH tan abd yerin dibine batar her pisligin altında sen ve avenelerin çıkıyo fetö illeti sizin başınıza bela olsun
Couldn't you just go to the court for help?
I need to remove my name from the affordable care act. I am very disappointed. It's not workign for our family!
Senate has abrogated their Constitutional responsibility. POTUS must make all pending appts let Senate undo after the election
@OFA When HRC wins the presidency withdraw Garland and nominate Goodwin Liu.
@OFA The Obamanation is UNACCEPTABLE!!

A request to republican Senators to help appoint Merrick Garland. Thanks
why would I do that?
Unfortunately it is expected of this congress.
You have pulled enough and gotten away with it.  I will be happy when you retire.
@OFA no more liberals allowed.please retire .
In order for us to make progress in all facets of life, we have to work together. Otherwise, what's the point?
worst president ever
"A little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own..."
they should have hamstrung every unconstitutional action instead you pushed through instead they assisted!
@OFA higt school
@OFA they gambled, on winning the white house. Well bet they are regretting now. Mitch McConnell, is a hypocrite.
@OFA Help the Christians in Muslim nations. #mercy
no, it's not unprecedented, it's not obstruction--it's an effort against you loading the SC with leftist ideologues.  Liar.
@OFA All your policies were unprecedented, but you still went forward in messing up this country of ours. 1/20/17
India should merge with US to get rid of China, Pakistan and corruption
we will have a fair hearing after trump is president
@OFA
Why is Garland a gay muslim also?
Just quit your crying. Doing just like you did but oh no cant do what Obama has done that is wrong because he is KING Obama
your buddies want more money to fund their terrorists. Another not ransom? IDIOT!
ooh, little bitch got his crew tweeting harsh
@OFA America shouldn't have to add their name there the Senate has a job to do and should do it tell the judge yes or no
unless your president with a king complex. I'm surprised you. Just don't make a procumation.
-> a republican senate without respect for its own republic ... they have hamstrung all three branches.
Too bad the @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP and ALL OF ITS SHEEP FOLLOWERS are racists and hates #America
@OFA After November let Madam president handle this issue
this is hilarious. Obama is a filthy charlatan
@OFA
@OFA I'm with you and I'm with HER!
@OFA guess Hillary will have to fix it when she wins I think she's ahead in the polls now
@OFA get over it. It's our chance now. You blew yours
I promise I'll not vote for any Republican in the Nov election. Pretty close to saying I NEVER will.
@OFA Please beginsupp
#Yes #DoYourJob
@OFA so do something about it, you are the cheif commander of the state.
@OFA je vous ai laissé un message sur votre Page concernant cette Annonce
- so is paying $400 million to terrorist.
Republicans don't respect you. I don't know if its something personal or racial? Just now Paul Ryan said Congress passed a law

@OFA OK.
