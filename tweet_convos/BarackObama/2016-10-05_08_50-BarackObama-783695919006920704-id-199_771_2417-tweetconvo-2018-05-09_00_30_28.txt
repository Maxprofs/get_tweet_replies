The House & Senate are some dirty calculating, non working pieces of sh--
@nytimes What the GOP isn't getting clear is that a hamstrung Supreme Court is hurting them, too! #doyourjob
It is very important for a democratic country that judicial system work promptly for this there should be always fully judges.
Lincoln's GOP turning a deaf ear to a majority of Americans that want McConnell to give Garland a hearing. Tyranny
@nytimes 
Is it true DT paid $50.00 to actors to show up at his ralleys in the beginning of his general campaign?

@nytimes laughing stock of the world. Nobody respects us now. Thanks a lot president
@nytimes you're the worst president we've had in at least 60 years. US is in the worst shape EVER. We're the
@nytimes why aren't you in the white house doing the job you're being paid for instead of campaigning for the crook
@nytimesworld  they spew out whatever sounds good at the time. Then...nothing gets done..we're worse than before.

There is NO Democracy when we have a crooked Pres., DOJ that protects criminals! Greed & corruption runs rampant!
@nytimes
@nytimes liberals and Democrats are the new deplorables. Obama the first black and the first worst president ever
@nytimes Obama worst president ever and I voted for you. mainstream media are the true basket of the deplorable
@nytimes you know they're some ignorance amongst us the problem is they don't know it yet !
Are American voters going to reelect same unpatriotic @SenateGOP who put party before the constitution? #DoYourJob
It is still beyond me how we expect people to follow the rules when we can't ensure that justice will be delivered!
@nytimes  If the current election comes down to the Supreme Court it could tie! They need to act now to avoid that!
If the "President" won't accept that "no means no" what message does that send potential date rapists?
Too bad GOP senate can't do their job! They may regret not giving Garland a chance!
@nytimes Obama, you have yourself to blame!
The "country" is crippled because the court is "corrupt".
@nytimes Few more weeks it won't be your problem.  Off into history you go. BYE, BYE.
@nytimes
How about our crippled DOJ, FBI & State Dept. that you crippled during email-gate? Aren't they as crucial?
@nytimes Trump for President!! Killery for PRISON!!!
I reporting them to IBM AND OTHER BIG COMPANIES WHERE I HAVE PEOPLE WORKING. I DONT LIKE THE MISUSE OF TECHNOLOGY.
We have free will & nobody is going to force Me to like a rapist with satellite lights. Screw his fantasies
#SCOTUS rulings have already been affect by the #ShortCourt...but most not in the ways #Conservatives hoped for.
We DONT want U to appoint the next SCJ as U R in ur Lame Duck period & have nothing left to do but pay back favors & debts.
@nytimes estimado señor r presidente lo respeto muchisimo,espero gane la sra, Clinton,x el bien de todos

@nytimes THE CONGRESS IS TOO BUSY GETTING PAID BY OIL COMPANIES LIKE  BRITISH PETROLEUM #CHEATS
@nytimes keep going sir you will get it
maybe time to turn the thumb screws on McConnell. If Hilliard wins you will withdraw M. Garland's name day after election.
Don't worRy. Republicans have shot themselves in the foot.  Hillary will win and we'll get who we want.
@nytimes finially, other than enjoying fine Cigars I have something in common with Bill. BC I think it's crazy too

the ppl u want 2 appoint has nothing 2 do with up holding our rights it's only about there political views
Maybe that's exactly what some want to happen in America. A revamping of what we've fought for so hard & so long?
@nytimes I thought it was obvious.
Blame Congress for consistently dropping the ball.
@nytimes THE GOVERNMENT HAS BETRAYED THE PEOPLE BY CHANGING THE CIRCUITS OF ALL ELECTRONICS INTO MICROWAVE WEAPONS!
The new york times' "OPINION" is just that.
scotus is not crippled; it is corrupt.
why haven't you said anything about #NODAPL??? do u even care about that. Water is life.
.@BarackObama @nytopinion Again the "patriotic, constitution loving" GOP fail to do their duty. They would freak out if Dems did that!
@FoxNews @nytimes  the NYT is irrelevant to most Americans.
no. It's crucial 4 ur liberal agenda. Liar
@nytimes Mr. President, corral all those asses in a room, lock the door & stand guard til they get this 1 job done!
.@BarackObama @nytopinion Quack!
Hey Barack the next time this country wants a Three Dollar Bill you will be chosen. You are but a Counterfeit
Hi
@nytimes It needs to be done now.
Solve the problems by putting President Obama nominee in the position. #BetterSafeThanSorry, that is essential.
Democracy is not understand all in the world so.
we do not need more liberals on the bench who write their own laws rather than obeying the constition
Current GOP Senate members should not B reelected.  If the American public does its job, they will not reelect them
@nytimes ....reading that rag is like Pravda, a state run propaganda tool....
In my opinion, firing @POTUS @BarackObama is essential for democracy. Nobody cares what @nytopinion @nytimes thinks. @FoxNews @nypost @WSJ
idiot
@nytimes 
Helal olsun başkan
@nytimes might be only opinions who matter less than @POTUS @BarackObama. America's ideologues unite! @FoxNews @RealClearNews
@nytimes we want people who defend the constitution not like your last appointment
@nytimes
@nytimes
@nytimes freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. remitted back to the United States,
@nytimes it will be filled. Just not by you.
#Liberty is crucial to our democracy #EndTheDrugWar #EndAssetForfeiture #EndGovtProfiteering #DoTheRightThing #LegalizeIt
As usual, the #GOP puts the interests of their party above the interests of our country. #DoYourJob

@nytimes Actually, we're  not a democracy (try Constitutional Republic), and there's NO requirement till aft elect
Nah.

Hello king Barack Obama ,invite you to Islam right Islam،Thanks.
TRUMP WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT.
@nytimes @BarackObama @nytopinion @nytimes Literally, has zero to do w/ democracy. Democracy is a co-op.
Nothing in constitution says how many or when they need to be replaced. Election next month will ultimately decide.
كل خرا
Congress *chooses* to do nothing. Time for an executive order to keep SCOTUS at full strength.
@nytimes GOP lawmakers NOT DONG THEIR JOBS need to be VOTED OUT!!  #You'reFired
so you can fill it with a liberal democrat....?
@nytimes There are a lot of crucial matters for your democracy if you look for.
This is from a crowd that walks around with the constitution in their pocket,yet won't fulfill THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
@nytimes
Proud of you, Prez! You're the best.
lupe Jose martinez hello good morning democratic yes
@nytimes I agree.with you.
Would u like to surrender and join my army? I will appoint you as my chief centurion.
@nytimes stay positive and have the hillary and trump and congress wear my shirt
@nytimes if SCOTUS was or is 'crippled' why did it tender a decision in the Texas case?
dont ask rational questions of this potus, he can't answer
@nytimes #سلام
@nytimes with republican party in control of the senet and the house nothing gets done the doc party  takes over
@nytimes it will get filled in a few days,right after your gone. Not for you to worry your little head over.
Let the next President Pick! This was Senator Schumer's Idea! Remember he is a Democrat!
The Supreme court should not be political
