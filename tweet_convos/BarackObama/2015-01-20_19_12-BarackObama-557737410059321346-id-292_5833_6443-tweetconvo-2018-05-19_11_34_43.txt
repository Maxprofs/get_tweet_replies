@BarackObama very proud of u..:)
@BarackObama future generations r going to be saddled with ur debt stupid
@BigKahuna919191 I honestly don't see the problem with @BarackObama He's done more than most presidents.
@BigKahuna919191 That's not true at all. He's actually benefited those in need. The only people complaining are snobby rich people.
@BigKahuna919191 he's been too busy fixing other presidents mess. He's done what most couldn't and passed most reforms people bitch about.
@BigKahuna919191 Did Obama have anything to do with that mess? No. Don't bring it up bub.
