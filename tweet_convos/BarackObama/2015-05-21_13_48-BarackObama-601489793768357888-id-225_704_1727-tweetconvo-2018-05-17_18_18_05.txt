@BarackObama انت عندك عدة وجوه
@BarackObama You can't handle the truth
Would argue the administration of @BarackObama is not "stepping up" since it's his responsibility to protect honeybees amongst other things.
@BarackObama @eilperin
@BarackObama @eilperin maybe that's why there are about 100 million unemployed. Your laser beam is pointing elsewhere.
