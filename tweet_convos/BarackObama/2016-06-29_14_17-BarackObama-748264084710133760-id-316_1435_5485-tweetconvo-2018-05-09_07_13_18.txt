Meanwhile @realdonaldtrump vows to
"Bring back coal jobs" which are dangerous
to miners rather than safe & clean jobs
#HILLARY
So your answer is that its ok to take jobs as long as you don't see them is good? Silly libs
Coal companies cut jobs
mining became more efficient
Maybe direct your name-calling at them?
Those evil successful people!
And so now I will BLOCK U
Peace!
Why do liberals always block ppl who disagree, do you not believe in discussions
Wrong
But when someone starts name-calling
& they don't know me
Yea
I have no interest
I'm not here2fight
I don't see any name calling, I see someone expressing their point of view that differs from yours.
@WILLDYE4U And the rest of the world will be 90% renewable energy so we'll still be behind the times ,,,
Don't you agree you have to take the 1st
steps to try to leave our Progeny a cleaner
Planet?
To do nothing is selfish
The rest of the world is fighting ISIS. Obama is fighting for solar panels. And for men in the womens room
US strikes pound Islamic State, kill 250 fighters http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/AAhN1uD?ocid=st …
