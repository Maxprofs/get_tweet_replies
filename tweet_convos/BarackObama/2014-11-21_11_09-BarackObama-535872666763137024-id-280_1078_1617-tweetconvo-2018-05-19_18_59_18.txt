@BarackObama this simply means more taxes will be paid by those that work & actually pay taxes to carry the burdens of those that don't
@BarackObama @derikstevenson Just like the ACA was only going to cost 900 million. Apparently math is a fairy tale in DC. #fail #whatistruth

@BarackObama this is not a dictatorship position he is in , though he seems to think so !
@BarackObama $25 billion is barely over one THOUSANDTH of our debt.
“@BarackObama: The #ImmigrationAction President Obama is taking will grow the economy and reduce the deficit by $25 billion in 10 years.

@BarackObama Sorry Mr President I disagree 
With you on this one. People who break the law regardless of the reason should not be rewarded.

.@BarackObama U expect us to believe BS that you don't even believe
@BarackObama Clearly still thinks we're stupid.
@BarackObama I wish this applied to individuals that fueled the economy with out of state tuition for 8 years as an international student.
