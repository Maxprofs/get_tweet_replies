@ToddDracula @BarackObama
U dumbass Hitler hated blacks like u do. Remember Jessie Owens? Blk man beat hitler's ass before the US
this will. Ur boyfriend
how can you say that when you have not one but two 800 billion dollar stimulus package and funded obamacare
Are you saying statistics are just numbers and can't be manipulated? I can't imagine you are
140 characters can't explain that numbers can easily be manipulated.
Great job President Obama. Finally have a great Potus
This is not the face of American women.This is not okay.
how come Huckabee didn't come back?
because he is sleeping with young boys
@Tara44 oh yeah, did you take a look at CBO deficit projections going FORWARD? Always stat selection and manipulation
@naphtalwanyonyi Very true America has done well for herself, but as Big Brother at what Global cost during those 8 years? #NWO
@HCAlanTurner That's part of the picture
BULLSHIT
Only if it were possible, you would go for a 3rd term and if I had USA's citizenship, I would vote for you. I salute.
how do you double national debt for all previous presidents?
for the rich it's been a great ride, but the middle class is hurting more and more
thank you
Looks to me like the GDP is about to collide with the national debt. Disastrous!
NO
It's not about She can or I can, It's about We all can! #POTUS @ #NDC...It's Arithmetic Mr. President Well done!
you don't have any idea !! You should be ashamed to think everybody is as dumb as you!!'n
thank you
bom dia sr presidente  .ta a precisar algum jardineiro lol.
adding more debt is not a plus
yüksek Karizma li  tam bir lider  muhteşem başkan Obama size minnettarim sonsuz teşekkürler
türkiyede hertürlü yalan ve iftira senaryoları na maruz kaldım ağzımdan duymadiginiz hicbir konuya inanmamaniz büyük Arzum
The truth is you've nearly more debt than every other president combined-it's at $19.4 trillion. Obama's share- $9 trillion.
I had $50,000 in debt last yr and now this yr I've added only $40,000 in debt. Hey, everybody, I've cut my debt by 10 grand.
not true it'sup to 19 trillion
yes it is
absolutely right Mr President!
yes sir they want be honest so stand strong sir history will detail your legacy. God Bless.
but we're in debt 17 trillion
not good enough when 58 year old experienced MBAs can only get minimum wage jobs.
#Good job!!
This is good, but it's unfortunate that we can't eliminate the deficit and begin paying off the debt. Do that, you're legendary
didnt you want to raise taxes and the Republicans would not let you?  Just wondering
fucking lies
I saw some where that adding $4 trillion to the national debt was "irresponsible" and "unpatriotic". You added over $8 trillion
one day you'll learn that just saying something doesn't make it true. #keepfeedingthesheep
@pprussel14  That's what I'm talking about!!!!!!!!
by definition we are worse off if we have a deficit every year that you are In office.  Do you know how that works? B
Alice in Fantasyland
for sake of clarity - in which ways has it not improved?
opportunity
P..
“WE GOT COLOR” , http://easycolorexpress.com 
/ tell the whole story- you cut the deficit but increased the debt dramatically- this leaves us vulnerable
@@barack obama, u are the best, obama needs to rule the country until a better president is got
@BarackObama
Thank you for 7 1/2 years! We will miss you!
@lorij_clark That's a bunch of bull! Shitiest president ever!
JUST voodoo mathematics, we ARE worse than we were 20 years ago, the mean household income is at a 20+ yr low. You lie too much
That's a lie. You good at that.
That's something to be #proud of,in spite of the pessimism expressed by those who didn't expect you to make it this far
Playing black magic with the real facts!
you've added more to the national debt than all other presidents combined

TY 4 being our Pres... 
U've dne an Awesome job. Will  nver b anothr like U & My 1st Lady.. (gve her these flwrs 4 me)
it is time to roll out your accomplishments which are many without any help from the other side !!
CHIP-IN WITH US! http://easycolorexpress.com 
you burgled middle east!!!
@Prettyiis1982 meanwhile
That is not saying much since that is comparing the worst recession since the Great Depression.  Let's get straight talk.
@BarackObama
If true, how did an outsider get 14 million votes...please reconcile that Obama.
how can you say economic indicators are better when our debt tripled & labor participation dropped throughout your presidency?
DT said that our debt is at a record high of $19t; BIG difference between debt and deficit! Continue to educate voters.
Your Pres is running around blind without a cane. Obozo is beyond help. It will take years to undo his damage.
the GOP is interested in rhetoric and lies not facts, bunch of bigots
That is a straight up lie. Even the AA  are worse off in every way since you became president you just lie
@Marina_Sirtis really?  I thought the deficit was now 19 Trillion?
That's the encouraging results
We did it off of borrowed money. Who will pay it back!
Sing Along with, http://easycolorexpress.com 
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
ARE YOU KIDDING YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING WE CAN SEE THE NUMBERS WHERE THERE R SUCCESSES IT DOESNT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO W/u
Yeah, except unemployment. And I mean REAL unemployment not the fake numbers you parade around.
Thank God.
however you increased it by what percent to raise our national debt to over 19 TRILLION $?  Then want to claim a victory? MORON
I can't beleive you are so out of touch with the American people
You lie. You lie to the poor, the black, the Hispanic, the white, the middle class. Everyone except elite who buys you. Liar.
unless u look at middle class like me ur delusional
you can do that but not keep our country safe???????? 

This is why we need Trump in office!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
the "almost" is the money the average person has in her pocket.
Does that include the almost $20 trillion in national debt?
so u raise the ceiling to make ur numbers look good - what a joke...
wouldnt it b better if you dont judge yourself n let history do it
show the same graph starting in 2008.... Different story.
Please share that drug laced delusion making cocktail you're drinking.
great job Mr president !
---That is a LIE
the statistics do not support that statement.
How about the measure of unemployed? Real number; 27%. Great economy.
just because u wrote it doesn't make it true

Wait, wait, oh, I fell off the chair laughing, sorry.  Little pictures for little minds. Understand the economy much?
of course that's misleading, the debt is still skyrocketing, costs are exploding, and unemployment is increasing but who cares?
haha!!! What a joke!
And increased the debt by $10 TRILLION! Get real!
when trump gets in office after you he will change all the damage you have done over the last eight years
Heil King Obama, you live in lala land!
stop the damn lie's
Glad to see the facts of the success you have had.  I'd love to see a compilation video showing all of your great achievements
@ruthmglenn by doubling the nation's debt?
No, that's correct. Are you a fascist?
I'm a guy who had a job before #NAFTA , and H4V's , signed by the Clintons who never worked a day in their life.
Trump never talks about statistics.
Amen ! But don't tell the Republicans !
true those are facts
@Marina_Sirtis this isn't anything to be be proud of stop the wasteful spending
@Marina_Sirtis yes the budget deficit is lower but the National Debt has more than doubled from 9 to 19 trillion
are you joking, way to completely lie to the American people. I guess that is a norm for you.
Pure liberal garbage,  middle class has $4000.00 less yearly in our pockets. Due to liberal wants. We don't need illegals.COST
this guy must be smoking pot, really, I can't wait for January to come to watch u leave, in fact leave now.
...and this without the help from Congress GOP bunch of lazy ass.
The deficit, in isolation, means nothing. How's the national debt?
That is the amount for end of '09, he has done nothing but inflate it n bring it back with no benefits!
ni shuo de dou dui
then how did the Debt go up ?? Government math???
THANK YOU !!!!!!!!    Stand Tall ~   :)
it's really great ! Please share the secret behind it also !
in 2008 it was under 500B, then in 2009 u almost tripled it. Not fair to say u lowered it from when u raised it. #obama
Not in Florida...your stats wrong-
Mars is much better than the moon. Thank you. We love you too. Give us pieces of advice no to miss you. It is very strong
How about people no longer in the work force? That's what's driving all of your figures. You are such a liar!
la gardas sen Nasıl insansın bu Türkiye senin her dediğini yapıyor. Sen neden terörü desdekliyorsun. Ver şu fetö yü.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
what about the national debt?
love Obama but why should this matter especially if it is impossible to repay the 17-20 trillion debt? #usaforbankruptsy
@jpobro in fairness, I think this is a comparison of Obama's first budget v. his last. Not v. prior admin.
