@BarackObama @Alex_Verbeek @chriscmooney Great news, but I bet that lawn and pool are depleting an aquifer.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost The only reason solar is doing good is because tax payers are supporting it.  #ActOnClimate
. @BarackObama @chriscmooney they are dependent on huge tax credits. I could make hamster wheel energy the next big thing with gov $$
@PoliticalCow @BarackObama @chriscmooney Solar companies would not survive on their own. They need tax payer's money. #ActOnClimate
