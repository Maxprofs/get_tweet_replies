@BarackObama Absurd statement
@SissyWillis @BarackObama Statement? It's called scientific research. It's not an opinion.
@jimmy_tiddow Yes. I've heard a lot about this thing we call scientific research. Field is saturated w false reports, doctoring data
@SissyWillis This is based on simply measuring the temperature across the globe for the last 150 years. It's not rocket science.
@jimmy_tiddow And we trust the figures why? I'm recalling through the years measurements off because taken near heat sinks like cities
@SissyWillis so do you distrust all science?
@jimmy_tiddow You misunderstand. I adore science. It's the prevaricating scientists I distrust.
@SissyWillis what truth are they avoiding or concealing? This seems like an awfully big conspiracy.
@BarackObama @USATODAY GOP: that reality is not convenient for my business. I'm going to pretend it's not true. Screw future  generations.
@BarackObama this heat stuff is scary...i for one drive little as possible, turn off electric switches when not use. Walk, bike, bus, metro
@barackobama Too bad our Commander-in-chief is incapable of reading satellite data as in zero #globalwarming
When did we get a Commander in Chief?  That position has been absent the last 7 years..... IMHO! @ClrView @Carbongate @BarackObama
@mn2a4asupporter @carbongate @barackobama A brief moment when I was attempting to be respectful.

@BarackObama /These ladies themselves are the weather report, I couldn't sleep properly the whole summer here in India, 90% of me is lost.
@BarackObama 미국도 덥겠다...
@BarackObama Can be a sign of global warming, or just a fluke?
@BarackObama  July very well may have been, but, extreme short summers is a cooling trend, not a heating. Were already cooling off very fast
@BarackObama هذه السنة سيكون الجو بارد جدآ بنسبة لسنوات الماضية والله أعلم
@BarackObama and was probably recorded somewhere in the desert where no one has ever been to even record temperatures until July. Liar
@BarackObama stop chem trails,then!

@BarackObama @LorettaLynch @CBSMMiller @FLOTUS Its up to the Ferrell's to define Justice for Jonathan. @MaureenOBoyle Its their peace.
@BarackObama @LorettaLynch @CBSMMiller @FLOTUS @MaureenOBoyle I believe? It is best to show who Jonathan Ferrell was as a person. Respect.

@BarackObama yes
