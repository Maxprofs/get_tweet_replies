@ITTRP @jakubzavrel @BarackObama US Labor Market Participation Rate still historically very low http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000&from_year=2001&to_year=2015 …
Indeed, @jakubzavrel.  See:
A picture worth 1,000 words:
@MaryAnnRoden @PolitiBunny @TheDemocrats 
@ITTRP you trollishly seem to forget that G W Bush presided over the policies that led to the big drop in employment participation rate.
@jakubzavrel When @GOP last held House, Senate, & @WhiteHouse (Dec 2006) Unemployment was 4.4%.  http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000 …
@jakubzavrel @GOP @WhiteHouse When @GOP last held House, Senate, & @WhiteHouse
Employment-Population Ratio was 63.4%. http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000 …
@ITTRP Sure, President of the US has limited actual influence on the labor market, but that's true regardless of political color.
@BarackObama @RobMetalMason I thought Barack's policies were going to be the ruin of the nation.  #ThanksObama  #economy #tcot
@ThosChamberlain @RobMetalMason @BarackObama Always more effective to focus on the issues at hand, rather than a specific ideology.
@RobMetalMason @ThosChamberlain Ideologues care less abt results, more abt "how" things are done. The @BarackObama admin has done opposite.
@Pietro5266 @RobMetalMason @BarackObama That's an interesting point.  #Obama administration has done a lot more than they get credit for.
@RobMetalMason @ThosChamberlain Yeah. If things continue going well, history will easily look upon @BarackObama favorably.
@BarackObama Added 295,000 Jobs in February; Unemployment Rate at 5.5%
