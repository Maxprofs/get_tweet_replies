@PlainUnamerican @BarackObama What is your opinion on SCOTUS ruling unlimited campaign contributions?
@fight4women @BarackObama First amendment rights.  Tried twice in the supreme court.  Both parties can use to their advantage.
@PlainUnamerican @BarackObama The Wealthy are RAPING U.S. of its wealth. They do not put the tax breaks or subsidies back into economy.
.@BarackObama Your policies have strangled the middle class. #Obamacare deductibles alone can't be met.
@MeganSmiles @BarackObama GOP puppets incl. SCOTUS enact laws for 1%, Citizens United= NO Democracy. Wealthy run GOVT through ALEC & GOP!
@BarackObama @waxc9 Historically USA prospered 'cause of slave practices and suppression of human dignities while GB thrived bczof feudalism

Trickle down, huh?

CA Democrats give 1% Hollywood cronies $330M/yr from taxpayers.
