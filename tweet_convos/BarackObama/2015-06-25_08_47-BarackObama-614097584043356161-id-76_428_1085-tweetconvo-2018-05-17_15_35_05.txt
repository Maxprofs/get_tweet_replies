@BarackObama that's great. Finally also poor people can afford health.
@BarackObama I feel for you.
@BarackObama 
Health Care should be the right and not just privilege for every citizen. This should be a universal law.
@BarackObama there is nothing universal about taking coverage from payers and giving it to others. 6.5k b4 my coverage kicks in smh
@BarackObama @MAF11 Deceit. See Gruber's facts. Millions LOST coverage and were FORCED to buy gov't coverage, UNafforable without subsidy.
@BarackObama could you also give the stats of those that have lost their healthcare due to this taxpayer funded Ponzi scheme #tcot
@BarackObama
@BarackObama good job Mr President.    Hopefully the political jockeying will end now (doubt it though)
@BarackObama congrats on a win!
@BarackObama Obama Care! Absolutely! Now it's about, We the People!
@BarackObama Thank you Mr Obama! Those of us directly and positively impacted by the ACA are grateful!
@BarackObama Sir, Thats a tremendous achievement! Kudos!

@BarackObama please mr.president. solicito  visa de trabajo para mi y a mi esposa y de estudiante a mis tres hij@S...quiero trabajar en USA
@BarackObama "the fact that we made it illegal not to have coverage didn't hurt"

"As the law's provisions have gradually taken effect, more than 16 million Americans have gained coverage so far." —President Obama

@BarackObama Seniors who want to cover big gaps in Medicare coverage must spend THOUSANDS for costly "Medigap" policies-a huge burden!
