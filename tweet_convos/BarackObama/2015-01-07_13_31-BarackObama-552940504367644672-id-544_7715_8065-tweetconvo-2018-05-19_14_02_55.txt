@Rronikollaj lmaooo what you mean
@MilesOffAMolly government been said fuck Detroit
@Rronikollaj my man don't believe everything you read, detroit is on the rise, they're getting all the abandoned houses destroyed and the
@MilesOffAMolly it's going to be 10 years before the D is a real city again and that's the truth my dude
@Rronikollaj maybe to be booming, but crime rates have gone down each year and at the pace they're at it'll be a decent city in 5 years
@Rronikollaj downtown is booming man have you seen it? Even places like 8 and 7 mile on the west they're putting business and lowering crime
@Rronikollaj shit even Warren looks somewhat decent now on the border of Dearborn and detroit, the crime is still iffy but they're working
