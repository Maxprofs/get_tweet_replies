@BillNye and you head the top of the list for what I'm most ashamed of. Delusional
Matt, please educate yourself before speaking to our commander and chief that way.
ummm ya okay. He's a disaster, train wreck, disgrace, divider.... Better? 
No, it's not better. You have no idea what it's like to be president regardless of political affiliation.
are you serious?? Funniest shit I've read all day. 
I'm sorry. You're a storm chaser. How many lives have you saved by watching tornadoes this year?
how many lives have you bored with your rants this year? Go away. Shoo shoo.
I didn't think you could answer that question. Thank you. Your actions prove your meaning.
You have broken every promise on #Obamacare

You don't have a leg to stand on
that's funny because everyone I know is benefiting from it
2 people benefit for every 10 who are persecuted
so what you're telling me is someone who doesn't know nothing about politics will do better
what does that have to do with global warming? #Obamacare
where  talking about two different things

goodbye Barack. Failed president
you forgot yor record on race relations turning back to the 1950s after the last black president was elected.
I cannot believe it would help the climate in the future to build more and more solar collector.  Wouldn't they be garbage?
hi
Nonsense.  The government agencies are adjusting the raw temperature data making the past cooler and the present warmer.

We do not know enough about ocean and cloud interaction, and over million of years climate changed from hot to cold.

I love my President! 
It's called EVOLUTION..or are you that naive to think man is the end game

@BillNye 4.5 billion years old planet. What % do you have records for?
Lead us to fight this greatest battle. Create the new greatest generation. Stop pipeline expansions & new drilling.
the people of Biafra need you to come and help them actualise there freedom and that is the highest record you can break.

.@BarackObama So basically it can be summed up by; "First Nigger President."
Hillary needs to be speaking up on this.
@BillNye But I have a snowball in February!
climate has changed for millions of yrs, a few months mean nothing!
It is a priority if you and I want our grandchildren to survive.  The earth will but mankind, no so much..
@BillNye Agreed. So why do we continue allowing drilling, fracking, and tar sands projects?
#charlotte help us
Distressingly true,  we've also set records for drone strikes and deportation of children. Also not a source of pride.
You're Awesome Mr. President! Ignorant haters have to hate. They don't know any better! Love conquers All! Love to you & yours!
I don't know about America, but Ireland's summer was shite
And it was happening 8 years ago.  How many times did you mention this in the last 8 year So?

@BillNye in office since 09' what did you do help that out ?
President Obama can not do anything about climate change, check with God about that! IJS
so let's do something about this, shall we?
Not looking at broken records but at the gold records.
I wonder what the people of Aleppo think of this Mr President? I doubt if they would be proud of you. Regards
Thanks @BarackObama !!! 
El cambio climático, ya está aquí, no es una previsión del primo de Rajoy, es una realidad medible.
