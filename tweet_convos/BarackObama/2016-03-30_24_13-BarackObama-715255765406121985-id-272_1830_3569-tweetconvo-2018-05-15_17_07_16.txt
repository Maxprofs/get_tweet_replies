@BarackObama Sorry but you've made enough decisions as dictator in chief.
@BarackObama tht true
@BarackObama Nope! You have received Senate advice. They did their jobs. No Garland in 2016
@BarackObama "To do their jobs" is the operative phrase when what's going on now is an embarrassment.
@BarackObama  I like  u  Mr  Obama   Do their  jobs and   give   judge
@BarackObama it's sabotage of legitimate constitutional process and thus ill will and affection against US, contrary to oath of office.
