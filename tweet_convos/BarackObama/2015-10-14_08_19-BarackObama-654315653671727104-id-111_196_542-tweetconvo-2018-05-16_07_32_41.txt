@BarackObama @GovEdRendell the #TPP is never going to be supported by Americans. Who would honestly support a deal done behind close doors.
@JMillam  polls show majority of Americans, including Democrats,are in favor of expanded trade!!
@GovEdRendell How could the majority of Americans support it when the majority of Americans do not know about it? Where is the transparency?
@JMillam poll says they favor expanded trade!
@BarackObama lovely♪
#PA has already lost 314K+ jobs, @GovEdRendell. No more #NAFTA-style #trade deals like #TPP! http://bit.ly/1KR1ipY  @BarackObama #StopTPP
