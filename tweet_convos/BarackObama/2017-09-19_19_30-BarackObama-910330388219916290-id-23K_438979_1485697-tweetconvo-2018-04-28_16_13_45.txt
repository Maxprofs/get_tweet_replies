Neighbors?
That’s an awful kind word. 
You mean the 3rd world banana republic that is run by the drug cartels? THAT Mexico?
In our city, we call those ‘neighbors’ blockbusters
Obama !! Come back : ) hope your enjoying life as one of us .

I think I need to meet you.
Estamos con todos los Mejicanos.
Gracias...tambien pensamos en nuestros vecinos del norte

Please... come back te lo suplico
Go away already- o mejor todavía, múdate para Méjico.
Thank you Mr President, and dear friend of Mexico!
You were better to Mexican nationals than you were to American citizens. That part of your “legacy” is forever.
I'm thinking of them to. On a plane back to mexico
You should move there.
Is Hillary Down?? 5thfrLaundry23hrs
Move forward
You are a classy, humble, intelligent person, I'm 21 years old and you've been the best president I've seen, you are missed and loved by mexican-americans like me! you give me hope for America after the not so classy president we have today. Besos y abrazos, thanks for existing.
Well spoken by such an amazing man. @BarackObama
Obama used black people to get elected and did absolutely nothing for you all but get you hyped for change that never happened. Keep on voting democrat. Maybe after the 6th one you will figure out you’re just being used for votes then forgotten.
You are an inspiration as a person, a politician , and as someone that fights for what they believe in, thank you 

Yeah I'm thinking about all of them that you let come in here the last year that you were president it's a crying shame
It's one thing to say and call someone friend. But when you encourage a country to go and break the laws of the other in the name of friendship (such as our immigration laws) I have a problem with. This is what you are doing in the name of friendship.
Nice
Good morning
Right on
We missing U

Yeah, you're just so buddy buddy with Mexico.
Hi, you are missed!
So sweet & a real Human Being!! Dreamers matter! Refugee’s Matter!  We all matter! Climate change matters!! 
My brother In-law was sent back to Mexico who has 2 children here 9&15 & was LEGALLY MARRIED 2 my sister @12 yrs!! Grabbing him well working & not even able to say good bye to my nephews! My heart is heavy with sadness. Hard working man, his 2 boy's NEVER WENT W/O.

FLASHBACK: Obama makes a 2008 campaign promise to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. 

He later broke that promise, used the U.N. as a politi…

Am I right?  It could always be worse so just learn to accept the status quo of martial law because I could be living in a rice field in China. So when I say kick out UMC, it could always be worse.  Just think about living in a killing zone in Mexico.  Thx for the outdoors btw
As a matter of fact, because of their ambivalence, they should forfeit their raises and retirement and donate it to the starving children in Africa.  And I’m glad they’ll agree to help personally address the water crisis in ES with their sacrifice of their pension.
There are starving children in Africa.  Now that may be explicable because of the DOD and mining, but the DOD should be thankful with their paycheck.  Do people in Ethiopia get benefits when they retire?  No.  So think about them.
Always someone in a worse position except the person who’s in the worst position.  So tell everyone that.  It’s myopic to ever complain or lament anything.  When those agents don’t get the promotion, just say I could live in NK!
They should never complain.  Always think about the victims of NK or even countries in the ME.  It’s not that big of a deal, and they should learn to accept the constant violence because there are other countries that are more violent.
It could be worse for Hispanics.  They could all live in NK.  They should be happy to live in killing zones where drug cartels dominate.  As a matter of fact, they should be glad to live in the killing zones.  Why don’t they think outside of themselves?  So myopic.
Привет
You are a huge role model to myself and my fellow peers!
we all miss u


"4 more years!" "4 more years!"

Why you don’t think about your neighbors in USA because you are an American right?

Yes, but you have allowed too many to come in to the USA.
You should move there and claim you were born there
You cared about the people, wish you where still there
You are missed Mr. President!

Mr President Obama sir they are suffering.the gov
Sorry sir like I was saying they're government don't take care of they're kids like us being Americans.
 Love You Mr President Obama
Ya but uganda also your neighbour
Don't U Think About Africa?
Hi Mr happy new month
All of my love and respect to you Mr. Obama.
Thank's my presidet
If you have a duck then why deport more of us than any president ever, why did you make daca and keep us limbo, you had house & congress
I like all your fake likes...LOL
You are so cool!! I love you!
come back President Obama .. We miss you ..
cool
Us Mexicans don’t like you either
Even your propaganda can't make Trump's hair look good.
Nevermind the fact that building a wall will only have a short-term gain at most, and add to a long-term economic problem
Your wrong there, look how long the iron curtain was up. Patrolled it when I was in the army. I can be very effective.
There are three basic ways to be smuggled into America - by air, by sea, by land. Even going by land is possible via tunnel under the wall.
Nice people for nice world 
Not forgotten
Gracias we love you
Мой друг! Ты разве еще не на пенсии?) Ты не гоняешь диких мустангов по прериям?

Ur the great man


I heard Obama gave something like $100, 000.00 to Skid Row Housing Authority and places like that for low-income apartments to be built.
I want to personally thank you as many of my friends benefited  from that.
