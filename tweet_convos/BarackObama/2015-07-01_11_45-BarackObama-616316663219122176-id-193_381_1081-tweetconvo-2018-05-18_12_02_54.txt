@BarackObama 我们国家也是该多好!
@BarackObama Saying it doesn't make it so. ACA has hurt millions. Counting the days 'til you charlatans go back to where you came from.
@RocIngersoll To borrow your phrase.." If U had 3 brain cells U would know..." that U are NOT talking to the REAL Obama...lol. @BarackObama
@BarackObama @BernieBrigade 
And the millions that are denied healthcare because of GOP Governors are ignored
@veggie64_leslie @BernieBrigade @BarackObama shouldn't that read: because GOP governors are ignorant???
@BarackObama except for those who now work less hours, or those who pay more for less coverage, or those who lost their doctor and policy...
@BarackObama I had excellent health insurance until Democrats stole it!
@BarackObama very emportmen
@BarackObama u said "If we liked our insurance we could keep it", I'm very sick & have been booted from my ins bc of mandates & can't afford
@BarackObama This is not quite true. However, for the entire Nation, on average it is, and the yes, #ACAWorks.
.@YULANDAJONES There's just that little matter of the many millions getting screwed six ways from Sunday. @BarackObama
@corrcomm @BarackObama No. That's not true, either. YK
.@YULANDAJONES Oh yes it is. I'm one of them. @BarackObama
@corrcomm @BarackObama If you look at my previous comments today, and also yours, again, no. You (cont) http://tl.gd/nk6fnj 
Who told you this??? RT @BarackObama "Everybody who has health insurance benefited and continues to benefit from this law." —President Obama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama thanks for the BC 
@BarackObama that s nice for your 4th july, but the ucraines have burned with theor shelly 100ha with wheat as i saw by pic
@BarackObama BULLSHIT!
THEN U GET ON IT!

"@BarackObama: "Everybody who has health insurance benefited and continues to benefit from this law." —President Obama”
@BarackObama Truly? How do I benefit for having to pay for everything cuz my deductible is so high?Do you even know what a deductible is?
@crazy4glass @BarackObama nope. Because HE doesn't have Obama care! INSANE, right?
.@BarackObama Liar. I LOST my coverage, AND I have to pay a fine. YOU screwed up. YOU should pay it.
@BarackObama bravo Mr president
MT @BarackObama "Everybody who has a health insurance company benefited and continues to benefit from this law." —President Obama
@BarackObama when does my $2500 saving check come.
@BarackObama that is a complete lie. Our health insurance rates went up and coverage went down.
@BarackObama I dispute your statement based on the fact that my premiums doubled. But maybe I'm the only one.
@bronkepotamus You are most definitely not the only one. @BarackObama
@BarackObama Mr. President maybe $500 a mnth is affordable to you but I bet it's been a while since you had to live off of less than 50k/yr
@RegeenaLane @Juanita_Estrada @BarackObama Hey, when u go thru life on scholarship, everything looks affordable.
@BarackObama sir your leadership-usa has changed for good as everybody can get health insurance beneifts as it was upheld by supreme court
@BarackObama hello
@BarackObama Lies,lies and more lies. It's all you've got. Your legacy= lies and failure.
@BarackObama law
@BarackObama There's now a donut hole in my coverage, on costs below $6K, since the ACA took effect. Have you heard much about that?
@BarackObama actually everyone who owns an  insurance company will benefit from #SCOTUScare -- not the sick people
@BarackObama Whoa. That's a HUGE whopper of a lie. I've NEVER paid so much 4 health cov in my life & I have Crohn's, I can't just NOT go
@BarackObama I guess it doesn't matter that many people who have health insurance hate this law because our insurance sucks!
@BarackObama #YouLie was true then it's true now and pretty much every other time in between.
@BarackObama @evil_bun_bun Not when my family had better health insurance before Obamacare?
@BarackObama Thank you on behalf of my brother and my two sons.
That's a damn lie. All I get is more debt to China. @BarackObama
So I benefit from paying more now & my daughter benefits by losing services @BarackObama? Stop lying to people.
@BarackObama I think that is overstating the truth, at best!
@BarackObama That's an outright lie.
@BarackObama Get real Pres!  My ins rates went way up, coverage went down, no prescription discounts, who in the hell are you kidding, bs!
@BarackObama but are the benefits worth the cost?
@BarackObama I don't know how you can benefit from higher deductales and premiums. That is what happened to me.
@BarackObama Not college students whose parents have Tricare. Unlike others who stay on parents' insurance til 26, ours get dropped at 23.
@BarackObama #YesPresidentObama As a Up coming Medical ADministrative assistant How important Healthcare Insurance is to opportunities !
@BarackObama Wow. You really are too far gone!
@BarackObama you made it to where I can no longer afford health care and now me and my family are punished by fine for not having it. #usuck
@BarackObama I recently had surgery and I have #insurance already and STILL can't afford the remaining bill! Stop hospitals charging so much
@BarackObama yeaaahhhh....about that...I'm paying a lot more for a lot less
@BarackObama I am happy that #Obamacare is going strong, but it is a #Crime for #hospitals to charge what they do!!!
@BarackObama Nope, not "everybody". Not even close to "most". High premiums, high deductibles and narrow networks ... hooray.
@BarackObama that is so true,  mr president!
@BarackObama That is an outright lie. The facts and numbers show nothing of the sort. But of course, the media wont call you out on this
@BarackObama My premiums shot up and my deductibles skyrocketed. How is that a benefit? You are a shameless liar.
@BarackObama Many who have not been able to afford insurance before. Some do not want to share the cost unfortunately
@BarackObama Except for the millions who were harmed, lost ins, doctor, climbing premiums, cancelled plans, lost jobs/hours. Do they matter?
@BarackObama A lie so bold it would make Goebbels blush.
@BarackObama I know my single male friend in his early 30s sure appreciates the obstetrics coverage, despite the astronomical premium jump.
@BarackObama You know that is not true, you lying POS.
@BarackObama My sis is in the hosp right now w/ a blood clot in 1 lung. She would NOT be covered if it weren't for the ACA. Thank U #blessed
@BarackObama you roar demais!
@BarackObama did you mean to say "everyone who has a health insurance *company?"
@BarackObama Another tweet, another lie
.@BarackObama Sure do loooove those higher deductibles, premiums, & co-pays!!  #benefit #Obamacare #2500less #liar
@BarackObama you're on the same planet as Chris christie. The struggling, struggling even more.  We don't make your $ or get your pension
@BarackObama Is there a single Democrat who will call him on this blatant bullshit? Or are they too busy nuzzling his taint? #tcot #liar
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Taqiyya #LyingLiarsLie
@BarackObama Don't you ever get tired of shoveling bull$hit on top of BULL$HIT??? #OvomitScare is the worst thing to happen to this country.
@BarackObama my rates have gone UP about 80%  !!  how has this benefited me?
@BarackObama @POTUS there was a time when some people couldn't afford health insurance. now, STILL can't afford AND get fined to boot
@BarackObama Lost prescription coverage, a 570% increase in premium and going back to work to cover it. Look at all the benefits! Eye roll.
@bigfatgini You calculated that?!
@BarackObama Really?  What about the people who saw their premiums increase and their deductibles increase.  Paying more for less coverage.
@BarackObama Getting insurance should be a choice if it's going 2B this expensive. Ppl shouldn't be forced 2work 2min wage jobs 2 pay bills!
@BarackObama That is a flat out LIE!
@BarackObama I have benefited alright.  Over 1000 a month to keep my healthcare.  You have done a wonderful job.....
*United HealthGroup “@BarackObama: "Everybody who has health insurance benefited and continues to benefit from this law." —President Obama”
@BarackObama #educate #america #reschedule #medicalmarijuana #medicalmarijuana 50 states liberty and justice for all not just a few
@BarackObama so, @POTUS, WHY aren't YOU using it?
@BarackObama why has my policy doubled since this great law started
@BarackObama Thank you for my higher premiums & deductible.You are definitely providing hope, but it is for your early departure from office
@BarackObama Kaiser Permanent destroyed me. Assaulted in ER after 911 transport  4 heart attack. No reason given. NOW severe PTSD. Recourse?
@BarackObama so we have to pay between 40% and 10% for medicine, surgery (if and when it's a doctor who says you must have one)
@BarackObama My bank account says otherwise
@BarackObama in Spain... Anybody who's a citizen or is here legally has health benefits, the state or government takes care of most costs
@BarackObama I couldn't afford "Any" of the plans on a "part time" salary,and my refund was taken away from me.
.@BarackObama I take it back. Your presidency in TWO images:
@BarackObama ok... But what about the people that don't have health insurance because they can't afford it??
@adriennerich88 @BarackObama Then you pay a "tax" & get nothing! Yeah! What a buffoon he is.
@tdrunyon77 @BarackObama I wouldn't say buffoon... At least he's doing more than the last president... He has it difficult
@adriennerich88 @BarackObama I would say worse than buffoon. He's MADE it worse, much worse.
@BarackObama my rates went up and coverage went down.  Explain how I benefit, again?
@BarackObama What are you reading? Either you're lying or you've been lied to!
Please, don't let reality interrupt @BarackObama when he's busy patting himself on the back. 

#WickedHigherPremiumsAreAwesomeSauce
@BarackObama Thanks for making my insurance more expensive Your Grace!
@BarackObama seriously? Your clueless. It's not working! Try reading some of these tweets!
@BarackObama Everyone has to health insurance or face a fine! #Truth
@BarackObama Its just cray how many weak individuals just want tp say something neg about the black president
@BarackObama after say 5 million of them got booted from their working plans? cool.
.@BarackObama Your presidency in one image:
@corrcomm @BarackObama Tweet of the Century!
.@BarackObama You are insane.
@corrcomm @BarackObama good thing obamacare covers psyche care, eh? maybe some psychotropic medications would be helpful?
@MilitaryRosary I'm sure whatever coverage @BarackObama has, he could be very well taken care of. But he has to want it.
Well, looks like I'm a nobody then. How am I benefiting? This guy @BarackObama can't tell the truth about anything.
@BarackObama no you made my insurance useless.
@BarackObama Mr.President my insurance went up 33%.
@BarackObama So glad you are truly promoting this law. Thank you.
@BarackObama except when Medicaid expansion gets denied by GOP so they can blame you for the costs.
@BarackObama thankyou very much for everything Mr. President!
@BarackObama Mr. President: what going to happend with State like Florida, Who dont want the Obamacare?
.@BarackObama BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
@BarackObama the only question people should be asking is why it took so long for the ACA(Obama care)to be enacted...thank you POTUS!!!
.@BarackObama my insurance - which you forced me to buy - went up $40/mo this year.
@BarackObama Bwahahahahaha
@BarackObama said nobody ever who would prefer to just buy catastrophic insurance
@Andrew_Dad with the SCOTUScare deductibles that is about what it ALL is @BarackObama
@BarackObama  I  am happy because is our President.
@BarackObama what about us that do not have it Mr. President
@BarackObama The "law" odd word for what should be a given through taxation .. infrastructure funding should include people by default
@BarackObama it's only the people who don't understand that judge.
@AmericnElephant @BarackObama Exactly what happened to us, 33% increase.
@BarackObama I work full time with two small children and there are no plans that I can afford. It's cheaper to take a tax penalty...
@BarackObama glad to hear that,  thanks
@BarackObama Especially the insurance companies!  Follow the money!
@BarackObama how can benefit those people who cannot afford the health insurance
@BarackObama if you didn't have insurance and lived off the system you benefit not if you already had insurance.
And Benghazi was about a video. You lie. RT @BarackObama: "Everybody who has health ins benefited & continues to benefit from this law."
@BarackObama the blessed land of every black man
@BarackObama Not really. I'm paying a ton more for less benefits. Thanks.
@BarackObama I wish I could agree with that!
@BarackObama me! I have healthcare for the first time in a decade!! Single mom from Santa Cruz CA
@BarackObama Talk about Biafra. The Biafrans want their freedom from Nigeria #barackobama
@BarackObama awesome, now can we focus on the VA?
@BarackObama I will try a again.  When I did my pay would be $378.00 a mo....No way... that's not helping me..But got to still LOVE YOU
@BarackObama Not everyone. Premiums, deductibles & co pays all doubled.
@ToBellaG @Minizorg @BarackObama Doctors have left plans, HATE the PAPERWORK!
@educatormarcia @Minizorg @BarackObama & I am afraid it will only get worse
@ToBellaG @Minizorg @BarackObama Not if we turn everything around in 560 something days from now...
@educatormarcia @Minizorg @BarackObama We can hope. Has been pretty hopeless the last 6 years.
@BarackObama yes that's true
@BarackObama can i still keep my Dr and save $2500 like u promised?
@BarackObama Noble attempt, so keep it, but it does not work for the poor.
@BarackObama except those of us who have had their health care costs skyrocket due to high deductible plans. Tell the truth Mr. President!
@BarackObama um...I have health insurance and I and my family in no way benefit. Talk to the people this REALLY impacts
.@BarackObama
@BarackObama 说得没错
