@WhiteHouse That same dismal graph showing the worst recovery in American history and you act happy? #FAILURE
@MRVvoort @WhiteHouse ROTFL!
You complain about the "worst recovery" when the worst drop is right there on the map too??? #openyoureyes
@lenojames yes we complain about the worst recovery as we are in the middle of it and government causes it. 
@MRVvoort @WhiteHouse
@Rickmayhem @MRVvoort @WhiteHouse LOL Well, what about all those red lines then?
Was that the "best recession"???
@lenojames should not excited you
@MRVvoort @WhiteHouse
@Rickmayhem @MRVvoort @WhiteHouse
"Worst recovery" is like saying "driest water", or "poorest billionaire."
@lenojames well it's called the worst recovery because the middle class are still struggling which isn't how it's supposed to work
@MRVvoort
@Rickmayhem @MRVvoort The middle class blames the poor for their hardship. Poor people didn't get most of the money during the recovery.
@WhiteHouse Thank You Mr President.
@iGotSmarts @TheDemocrats you are ignorant
@iGotSmarts ........ cough ..... yes, indeed, you are the ignorant one in this conversation.
@WhiteHouse Were in debt over 18 trillion. Awesome job obama
@WhiteHouse WHAT BULLSHIT! DO YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID? JOBS CREATED IN INDIA & CHINA & FOR THE 3 MILLION FOREIGN WORKERS, NOT FOR AMERICANS.
@GOPonziconz Grow up and quit watching faux noise... smh
@KCDurling DID YOU ENJOY THE PICTURE OF THE BABIES FLOATING OUT OF THE OCEAN IN THE MIDEAST? OBAMA DID THAT YOU IGNORANT FUCKING ASSHOLE!
@GOPonziconz Bush did that when he got U.S. in a war based on lies... by the way, your garbage mouth speaks volumes... grow up.
@WhiteHouse Good news: full of lies and deceit. The worlds economy is imploding. Your stats are skewed or not real. @federalreserve
@danm414 You're the one who is skewed... quit watching faux noise and get educated.
@KCDurling it's so ironic I would say the exact same thing to you. But hey go ahead trust big brother gov't and let me know how it goes lol
@danm414 Since you don't "trust big brother gov't" you would be a hypocrite if you travel their roads, have kids go to public schools, etc.
@WhiteHouse o
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama maybe it's in another dimension? ;-)
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  whoohoo   93 million people have jobs. Less than 1/3rd of the population.
@WhiteHouse I'm 59 w MPA and 25 years exp. in marcom. Laid off 18 mo. Have been looking for job. Ageism exists; jobs rpt is irelevant, sadly
@jennpettley @WhiteHouse Our national conversation surrounding all things employment is chicken feed. http://bit.ly/1D66a2M 
@fordoers @WhiteHouse Lots of jobseekers, especially boomer age, and I know several, are not being counted.#jobsreport

@forwardeconomic @WhiteHouse Our national conversation surrounding all things employment is chicken feed. http://bit.ly/1D66a2M 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama bs, it's not at 5%. A lot of this "jobs" were part time. Stop lying
@WhiteHouse an example of @BarackObama leadership as President along with his cabinet and tell #FoxNews show this. #LegendaryPresident
@WhiteHouse That is great news, but as an adjunct faculty with the City Colleges of Chicago, I am severely underpaid for no good reason.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I heard CNN give Bush credit for the initial rise to zero. Part of their phony balancing act to compete with Fox.
@Jay00789 @WhiteHouse How many of those jobs provide a living wage? I want real numbers, not just the no. of people collecting unemployment.
@wanda_lotus @Jay00789 @WhiteHouse We need a household prosperity index to tell the real story - like a census. http://bit.ly/1D66a2M 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Let's see how many stay employed and redo the chart. It's very important - hire/clean-up?fire sucks >S< OFA LEADER
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama le taux de chômage est tombé au plus bas depuis avril 2008
@WhiteHouse Obama done nothing for jobs. The unemployment rate is of those who can file. Wanna know the real unemployment numbers?
@WhiteHouse Another lie to the American People. You ought to be ashamed and not bragging.

@WhiteHouse GOP. "Curses!  Foiled again"!
@WhiteHouse "out of the labor force" doesn't count as "unemployed" under those stats you useful idiots. Yes we can!
@WhiteHouse great effort by the government
@WhiteHouse Does this number take into account people not having found a job beyond unemployment?
@WhiteHouse Why does it not FEEL good then?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Thanks Obama!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama. Please help seniors by raising COLA for social security and not raising the cost for Medicare benefits.
@LanceFoss1 Employment in the USA will never be as it was in the past. Unemployment will be a way of life no matter how unfair it is.
@tindependent1he Who prints money? Who decides on global economy? How do you or I possibly live without income? You a thinking person.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Verry good news dear President, we continue to support you, also for your action about CLIMATE! Citizen Group BXL

@WhiteHouse this data is intentionally misleading. 96 million ppl not in labor force thanks to Obamanomics. #unemployment
@WhiteHouse And % of Americans particip in the workplace is still stuck in the 70s.... How about giving us acc # instead of more pol spin
@WhiteHouse Americans need 2 know what BO has been proposing.After detailing it, we'd like POTUS to give many interviews publicizing all
@WhiteHouse:4 ex:Infra will create ---jobs/retraining will create...jbos/EXIM will help small businesses/Immig will add so much $ to econ...
