@Payton_Gardner @neffchelly Your in a fascist Koch cult known as the Republican Party
@sailor_man_dan @neffchelly Dan, i guess you support the patriot act, open boarders, welfare, and our constitution being destroyed.God bless
@Payton_Gardner @sailor_man_dan ASSuming makes an ASS outta U. let it go Payton Gardner. He said nothing abt the patriot act, boarders, etc.
