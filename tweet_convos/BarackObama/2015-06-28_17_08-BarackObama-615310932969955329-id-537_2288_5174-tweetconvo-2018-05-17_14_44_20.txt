@BarackObama @AzumaNelson He says a lot of stuff , Half agree other half hate him with a passion .. Its how it works . I like him btw ..
@Seaniepc @BarackObama they gotta do something about gun violence in the US; too many innocent people getting murdered!
@AzumaNelson @BarackObama  NRA and supporters say different , They want More guns , Using the constitution and  The right to bear arms ,
@Seaniepc @BarackObama yeah I know but there has to be some common sense at some point
@AzumaNelson @BarackObama See that is the problem , hiding behind the constitution. also Remove all hand guns ( the crooks have upper hand)
@Seaniepc yeah it's a problem and the NRA has a massive political influence
@AzumaNelson Yes they have huge pulling power. It is sad to see all the violence all the murders , drive by's  home invasions , Its F'd up
@Seaniepc couldn't have said it better
@BarackObama Violent people are going to be violent. Infringing on the rights of all non-violent people won't change that.
@lancefannin @BarackObama But surely limiting access to guns would be a start?
@BigWeldon What about those who have a right to life? Those innocent people who died because of the US’s relaxed approach to guns.
@BigWeldon The gun laws clearly don’t work. This doesn’t happen anywhere else in the western world. Just America.
@BigWeldon Then why don’t they enforce those laws?
Of course @BarackObama really doesn't care about the people. He just wants them dependent. Live stock for the Progs, he works for @Birdseye1
@81I2, the ideal end is for people who crave for tools to satisfy their killer instinct realised that their perspective is primitive.
@Birdseye1 Make no mistake. Those who push for government control love this kind of shit. It's leverage they need to do what they shouldn't.
@81I2, that's a faulty argument. There would not have been talks of "control" if not for this kind of tragedy.
@Birdseye1 They are amplifying what does happen, playing down other news worthy items so it seems like we're under siege.
@81I2, the fact is the frequency of mass killings are up. The killing machine industry will eventually be very well-regulated. #tcot #nra
You provide no data, hypocrisy is more your rule @Birdseye1

@BarackObama
Since blacks went majority Prog Plantation, their murder rate is up 500%. They were on par B4. Problem is Dependency @BarackObama @Birdseye1
Obama better than the now one
@BarackObama important words.
@BarackObama  teach people batter problem sovling methods, that way people will find the real problem and fix instead of ducktaping it.
@BarackObama You'd just love for us to be defenseless against ISIS and your storm troopers.
@BarackObama Being one of few, who has never held or shot a gun. I feel that change!! Being from Texas, with the new open carry law.
@BarackObama for too long we've been blind to domestic terrorism by Americans and too quick to fight terrorism abroad. Time to change that.
@Jeremy_Lynn @BarackObama yes, do something about it!
@Jeremy_Lynn @BarackObama action not verbose do nothing statements!!! Act like a leader!!
@1mphigley ummmm @BarackObama has tried.... he can't do much when congress won't budge cause they are paid off by the gun lobby
@Jeremy_Lynn @BarackObama  I realize he should have people who should be supporting him
@1mphigley many do support him and I think like 86% of the country favor gun control but right now in America money makes law, not people
@Jeremy_Lynn sad, but it does seem to be that way. Where did we go wrong?
@1mphigley @Jeremy_Lynn Things like Citizens United and "Trickle Down Theory."
@BarackObama I was in Washington 20 years ago, Sen. Boxer's office. Begging for something to be done.#abouttime!

@BarackObama Hey, why there is black why in white house? :PPP
@BarackObama why would the US spy on its allies ? #nsaspyingfrenchpresident

@BarackObama hatred against one culture is taught and usually ends up into gun violence,its sad.thanks for speaking out
@BarackObama Stop another round of mass killings of #Biafrans in the Zoo (Nigeria) #BokoHaram arrives in Anambra to commence another war
@BarackObama The only thing we've been blind to is your anti-American, Constitution destroying agenda.
@BarackObama Law abiding citizens don't create gun crime, criminals do, it's a basic fact, but you do tend to ignore real facts though.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I was not I joined the nra in 1994 then I found out we have more guns in America than people I got out of the nra then
@BarackObama For too long you have disrespected the USA!  You Barrack should be behind BARS!  You are a CRIMINAL!!!!
@BarackObama You haven't been blind. It's just that too many of you have thought the answer was "more guns".
@BarackObama you are so right about gun violence and the rest of the world looks on and says why are most Americans so blind to this mayhem?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I agree let's open our eyes

@BarackObama Most dishonest tweet ever
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Agree 100%. Safety measures are not too much to ask the truly responsible gun owner. Thank you for your efforts on our behalf!
@BarackObama The violence is not from the guns, it is in the people behind the trigger.
@BarackObama please remember guns can't fire themselves, twisted sick minds can use many things as weapons. It's the user not the gun itself
@BarackObama not gonna happen !  This nation will fight back ! We did once before
@BarackObama I know, cops are dropping unarmed citizens left and right. Call your dogs back bud #takeaseat #NRA
@BarackObama #Ukraine use the UN 2 stop gun violence in Ukraine. Russian organises strategy around central airbases!

@BarackObama guns are inanimate objects. They cannot do anything without being controlled by someone behind the trigger. People are to blame
@BarackObama it's not the gun it's the person behind the gun.  We need our guns to protect ourselves from dicktators like you
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama why does gun violence happen in gun safe zones? Because no one can defend themselves there! Little old lady syndrome!

@BarackObama taking guns and wanting gun control is like saying closing bars will fix alcoholism! You can't fix stupid! We have rights!
@BarackObama #YesPresidentObama gun violence is a crime in Unitedstate's Of America, It must stop in every way provided for Safety living...
@BarackObama Let's say you actually got rid of guns, which would never happen. People would just turn to other weapons.
@BarackObama if you got rid of guns, you really think the criminals would get rid of them? There is enough guns to last for a long time.
