“@BarackObama: ICYMI: Our economy is growing at its fastest pace in 11 years. http://ofa.bo/d21t ” And you don't violate the constitution
@Westxgal I wonder how much the lower oil prices contributed to this?
“@Bagatino: @Westxgal I wonder how much the lower oil prices contributed to this?” None. He lies. They all lie. Lying liars to the low info
@Westxgal @Bagatino as gas prices falling by $2 that means prices were fixed
@legaldawn @Westxgal @Bagatino thinking lower gas prices/price of oil is a good thing is very short-sighted
@r0astduck @Westxgal @Bagatino I know it is never a good thing. Prices are artificially inflated.
@legaldawn @Westxgal @Bagatino no. OPEC is driving prices down to hurt US interests and industry, to attack shale oil and natural gas prices
@BarackObama The savers should move rapidly to cause the rescue
@BarackObama In the wake of civil unrest, we ask u 2 watch this award winning short film & pass it on :

@BarackObama ...good
@BarackObama The residues of the plane are based at a distance of 250 km to the East from Jakarta towards the sea
@BarackObama All passengers and pilots are inside the plane with the respiratory masks inserted on their faces
@BarackObama The lingusitic encoding of the cited idiom phrase shows that the aircraft is placed at a depth of 150 m of the sea bottom
@BarackObama   Liar!!!
@BarackObama Then the savers should use the echo scanning device to detect and refine precisely the depth of 150 m
@BarackObama The savers should adjust 250 km towards the cited perpendicular direction to the sea from the Jakarta place
@BarackObama Lies, lies and more lies and we all know it!!
@BarackObama  sir good going

@BarackObama I have always believed in you Mr President!
@BarackObama LIES. Unless you call all the millions on all KINDS of 'WELFARE' programs that fastest growing economy, then that's true!
@BarackObama The Information Unequivocally originates from spell-out the idiom phrase "Midnight Sun to Michael Cretu and Hubert Kah"
@BarackObama These Groups have declined cooperation and manipulated with the Intellectual Property (IP) developed by our US based Group
@BarackObama The aircraft crash was caused by the Singapore President and Singapore Company http://uitc.com.sg/ 
@BarackObama All 162 people on board dead, the crash residues will be found on Monday, lately Tuesday
@BarackObama The proviso says that the crash would take place during the night of the coming up Sunday
@BarackObama The spelling makes the proviso of the air catastrophe with the plane following from Indonesia to Singapore
@BarackObama The linguistic encoding is understandable during the transversion of the language into the Russian language transcription
@BarackObama The linguistic spelling of a song Midnight Sun to Michael Cretu and Hubert Kah warns about the plane tradegy
@BarackObama The song Midnight Sun to Michael Cretu and Hubert Kah has been tweeted as a track a few days ago http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1ZOAjZIcMY …
@BarackObama Mr. President: the proviso of the tragic event with the plane is captured in the linguistic encoding of a song

@BarackObama The retrospective vertical plate analysis and recognition of the posted tweets makes sense
