@WhiteHouse people, not women. Not men. When you people get the Fuck out of the way, America succeeds. Why do you hate America?
@TFinn82 @WhiteHouse who is in your way? If not men, not women what people?
Did I address you? No. So, get off my time line, jackass. @yesmam47 @WhiteHouse

@WhiteHouse Um, that graph is just a little outdated. And @BarackObama, shouldn't you show the country and the world by paying interns?
@Cowboy__Country @WhiteHouse @BarackObama you obviously missed how colleges work...they're investors in student's futures ;)
@airalin looks like college was a good investment for you. #MissCherry
@Cowboy__Country analogus to futures & commodities in a stock market...was i unclear? ;)
@airalin was I?
@Cowboy__Country idk but feel free to blame @JensenAckles today...
@airalin you're such a tease.
@WhiteHouse All men with Obama must leave America  for grand success of America.
@WhiteHouse  i love USA
@WhiteHouse please president Obama de await yuor help and cooperetion with this case's # 3:13-cv-00889(RNC) and CIV no # 3:12- cv-571 (JCH)
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it's human. Pointing out the difference reinforces the mindset for middle america...
@WhiteHouse  Man kann es nicht jedem recht machen. So ist das Leben.
@WhiteHouse The Dems/Obama's plan is to divide gender, divide race, divide by income and divide America. Once that is done he has a legacy
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse equal pay for women? Does that mean you will stop men from paying alimony and child support?
@WhiteHouse yes
@WhiteHouse Mr Obama then u must submit the control to any woman or all men along with u must leave America .
@WhiteHouse 

Mr. President
You are a God sent to the world. Your reform do not impact on the US only,but the world as  a whole.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Great message... Perhaps a memo to HR at the White House, and some reform on your watch?
@WhiteHouse Whats wrong with equal pay for women if they are doing the same job with men?They deserve it.
@WhiteHouse Mr President, God created woman as the helper and not the equal. A human thoughts led society is not far from failure. Wisdom!
@WhiteHouse sure is long overdue
@WhiteHouse The curve shows that the start income is equal. Why the income goes down as people get older? Women are even more intelliget.
@WhiteHouse .... Teachers are coming to school drunk!!
But yes the working women populous is rising.
#women'srights
@WhiteHouse America isn't succeeding, Vets are disgruntled, homeowners are homeless, policemen are killing innocent people...

@WhiteHouse  Ware on women by the Dems is pathetic and trying to make a case for equal pay. We are not stupid Obama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Equalpay for women ............ok, now make real what you said.
thanks.
@WhiteHouse Меня удивляет ваше плохое знание истории России. Вы постоянно искажаете факты. Если не знаете, не выступайте перед всем миром.
@WhiteHouse  IF OBAMA WILL HIRE ME as HIS SPEECH WRITER I'LL GIVE GREAT words 2 this good man who leads us. Please tell him to call me. RT
@WhiteHouse if you don't li k e him, just don't follow him. .I'm with you Mr President
@WhiteHouse not sure why it is more complicated than it should be? I guess it is the same as welfare? #dontgiveupthefight
@WhiteHouse   A good litmus test to determine how civilized a given culture/country is lies in their treatment of women. Islam???
@WhiteHouse filled with 2 faced liars.  Women don't need your help.  Pay the WH women fairly first.
@WhiteHouse peddles BS
@WhiteHouse please president help for lnvestigation by the federal Bureau of lnvestigation (FBI) thank you.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The pay gap between the 1% and 99% is the real issue. We're essentially all slaves to the 1%...working for survival
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama not necessary equal, but fair
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The gap seems to mysteriously occur when many women decide to put their families ahead of their jobs.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama so right around the time women start having babies income starts to drop, maybe income is traded for flexibility
@WhiteHouse Then pay your female staff the same as your male staff @BarackObama ! @scottandrewh
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama the pay gap is a bullshit myth! it doesn't take into account occupation, life choices, balances between home & work
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama i love this President equal pay ,, time women made their own money
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @knteller That graph is misleading. There is definitely wage gap but single graph is insufficient for its illustration
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Interesting..  http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?view=ptp_light&ref=bradjeredw …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama please keep in mind that this "fact" is based off the 2010 census and does not account for equal WORK.
@WhiteHouse how does the chart on disproportionate income between minorities and the status quo look like? Asking for a friend.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ..my mouth is seal .hummmmmm
@WhiteHouse Though pay may not be equal, has never been equal, there should be equal pay nonetheless. Education should  determining pay.
@WhiteHouse *Determine
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama further proof that complaining gets you nowhere
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama try telling the truth , at least once..
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama there should be equality in everything. Even they should get a chance to become president of US #equalpay
@WhiteHouse Why does this happen? Does Dictator Clueless Obama have a plan...or blow more smoke & golf?
@WhiteHouse @ZoeLaboy #ItsTimeToAct #PRChoseStatehood #EndAmericanApartheid
@WhiteHouse I think what this graph actually shows is: women born 4 decades ago have a worse gender pay gap than women born 3 decades ago
@WhiteHouse That does not imply that a woman will face a widening gender pay gap throughout her life
@WhiteHouse Of course the gap widens as we get older. Women get laid off sooner than men do. I'm living proof!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama pretty sure as we age women and men do not do the same work so this is not about equal work for equal pay
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Women are making the same as men out of school these days--maybe more. Older women--many factors.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama This is such bullshit. There is alot more to it than simply gender
@WhiteHouse Sure is a 13% pay gap between men and women working in the White House, age does not matter. Great job Chief. RT
@WhiteHouse that's an outdated policy for pete's sake!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Those favorites and retweets are impressive, people eager to support #POTUS on #social equality
@WhiteHouse enforce equal pay now women aren't second class citzens! US loses tax dollars with wage gaps! #EnoughIsEnough
@WhiteHouse why not make it happen.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama my mother earns more than most men #fucksocialism
@WhiteHouse  Right to not be discrimated against by race religion gender or nation of origin, through FLSA & U.S. Constitution. EPA of 1963
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Good job everybody. We can be very proud of it
@WhiteHouse by his grace, all will work out fine
@WhiteHouse keep saying it enough and it will eventually be true I guess
@whitehouse @barackobama #womensucceed thats why #usa still seeking there 1st ever #prez woman #america @bbc @abc @foxnews
@whitehouse @barackobama #womensucceed thats why #usa still seeking there 1st ever #prez #america @bbc @abc @foxnews
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama of course, it is true! and then what is your plan?
@WhiteHouse womens lib is what screwed us in the first place. They should have stayed home and took care of the kids.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Question: does a transgender get's the average pay between a man and woman?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObam  We can change that .I hope so.
@WhiteHouse It's true not only for US but whole world. Any country can't do progress until women will come forward.@niketashri @Nikki2472
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Right
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ,, clearly trend follows demand ,,  grant that equality reaches that goal ,, bite 2040 AD
@WhiteHouse I can't even get a job interview.  Usually pay is 1/3 of past job.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
About time America
@WhiteHouse Says women deserve equal pay, pay women less than men. #JustWords

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @kelvin_hard Feat lilian - Emiwado (Official video)
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama VERY TRUE >>>>>>
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Maybe you should practice what you preach. Do you pay women in WH the same as men? Nope!
@WhiteHouse I agree unfortunately there is more to it than pushing a mouse, as for labor concerns > 85% of the women can't do a mans job.
When the @WhiteHouse LEADS and doesn't DIVIDE America succeeds. Quit dividing this country for your own gain and look at the big picture!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 28 years old equal pay. Women's increase by age is less. Related to family planning?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  better than tryin to pay someone $40,000 a yr. To say hello my I take your order. On a job that needs no education
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I don't get paid at all... what is this madness?!
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse Islam and nothinf else
@WhiteHouse total crap!!! Would you lower pay of women earning above average pay?? Just name 5 biz NOT paying equal pay for women!!!
@WhiteHouse I think now government should need to take initiatives for equal payment both male and female! Women is power for a country
@WhiteHouse nice try in keeping AMERs away from important issues. It won't work
@WhiteHouse @SenateDems Massive oversimplification.  http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303532704579483752909957472 …
@WhiteHouse The lines separate right around the time that many working #women CHOOSE to stay home & raise their young children.
#ProChoice
@WhiteHouse Io sono  una Donna riservatissima .
@WhiteHouse we need to start IDing these men who make more than women and do something to them.  besides those in the white house of course.

@WhiteHouse #Womensucceed don't force equality, help fix the differences causing variations in pay. No handouts please, it's insulting to us
@WhiteHouse What sort of degree do people have that they're making 150k a year by their mid-30s!?!?
@WhiteHouse Ya know, if you repeat a lie long enough, it's still a lie. A real tired, old, vastly disproved lie.
@WhiteHouse A housewife's job is taxing, strenuous, stressful.  She is on her toes.  But she is unpaid!  The GAP is not justified
@WhiteHouse What specific proposal are you making?
@WhiteHouse Lead By Example Obama!
@WhiteHouse Hmm. "Gap" starts when women begin having children in late 20's. Growing % stay home after 30. Nah, doesn't explain anything.
@WhiteHouse source?
.@WhiteHouse Older people aren't respected as much now in our youth culture, women in particular, if they don't look younger than they are.
@WhiteHouse Equal share must be priority in terms gender pay instead.
@WhiteHouse from a terrible fate. Sincerely Angela Kenny UK Citizen
@WhiteHouse So why aren't the women in the White H
ouse paid equally, your hypocrisy and lack of transparency and honesty astounds me.
@WhiteHouse  have been taken from public lands and yet the US Government does nothing to protect its own heritage I beg you to save them
RT@WhiteHouse:When #WomenSucceed, America succeeds. It's long-past time to ensure #EqualPay 4women. #PaycheckFairness
@WhiteHouse All income levels, but not all occupations. Many female CEOs are paid more than their male counterparts in the same industry...
@WhiteHouse it splits right at the prime age for women to start having babies - correlation or causation?
@WhiteHouse Then start in the White House.
@WhiteHouse Start at 1600 Penn Ave... your staffers should be first on the list! http://wapo.st/1om71XP  via @washingtonpost

@WhiteHouse Women have succeeded, not because of gov't mandates, but because of hard work and integrity.  "Fair" is socialist, emotional.
RT: “@WhiteHouse: When #WomenSucceed, America succeeds. It's long-past time to ensure #EqualPay for women. ”
@WhiteHouse Dear President Obama I am disgusted to learn the BLM are holding 30,000 wild mustangs in holding pens when these majestic beings
@WhiteHouse @feminismkg Feed our children and then we can worry about pay equality.  Women share to save lives.  Period.
@WhiteHouse Female staff at the White House earn 88 cents on the dollar versus men. It's a war on women.
“@WhiteHouse: When #WomenSucceed, America succeeds. It's long-past time to ensure #EqualPay for women. ” MT AGREE!!!
@WhiteHouse That's why the women you employ ALL make less than men in similar positions. #DoAsISayNotAsIDo
@WhiteHouse DUH!

@WhiteHouse When will C. Rice start to earn her salary? What has she done lately? Why is she still in Washington?
@WhiteHouse @SenateDems Hmmm so interesting considering the fact that there is still a wage discrepancy at the WH. #GetYourHouseInOrderFirst
@WhiteHouse @cbsnews Fact is that what's good for ladies is good for the U.S.A. Why? If she ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
@WhiteHouse Again with your hypoctritical nonsense? 
Is that a chart for gender pay of employees in the @WhiteHouse as they get older?
@WhiteHouse This is not fair :(
@WhiteHouse  America succeeds
