@WhiteHouse tan really, planning on selling real estate after this, ...in Brazil to avoid prosecution no doubt. What legacy do you want?
@ScottSchlatter @WhiteHouse prosecution for what, Schlatter? Be specific please.
@jerichodrifter @WhiteHouse CIA&allied agent give ups inYemen&Afghan,Iranian centrifuge destruction now a lost means,BinLaden intel breaches
@jerichodrifter @WhiteHouse Guys, the Obama family and entourage are so VOID of ANY military experience or wisdom, it's a practical problem.
.@WhiteHouse won the night before the speech started: ”
@WhiteHouse With a light brown suit in the middle of January?! Terrible choice.
@MattColtHall Literally curious. Why is it a "terrible choice" ?
@Snerts Light brown is more of a spring and summer suit. Go with Black or Blue or something normal. Tan says summer #obamafashion
@MattColtHall According to whom? Teen magazines? Tan isn't normal? You probably think the same of his skin tone, huh? #gtfo
@Snerts Getting called Racist and its not even #SOTU time. LOL.
@MattColtHall I literally did not call you racist. ¿No puedes leer? Tú nececitas aprender, güero.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama why are we concerned about what he's wearing?
@WhiteHouse I was sure this #yeswetan hashtag was about the two dudes sitting behind the President. #SOTU2015

@Cmoyer @WhiteHouse Fox News said right after he came out who shot it down.  Can't remember who it was but someone did.  Supposedly.
@ufta @WhiteHouse I tweeted out an article. Apparently the tweet was a joke.
@Cmoyer @WhiteHouse ahhhh that must've been what they said.  I had just sat down.
@ufta Weak if you ask me. I'm guessing that went over 95% of people's heads.
@Cmoyer funny that the White House sent it out in a addition to the aid.
