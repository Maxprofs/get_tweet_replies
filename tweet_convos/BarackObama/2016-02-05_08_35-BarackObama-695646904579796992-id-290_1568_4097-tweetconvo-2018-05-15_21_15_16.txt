@BarackObama no it's not, our middle class is no where NEAR where it use to be. We need @BernieSanders to end corporate greed. #FeelTheBern
@JohnWusah @BarackObama @BernieSanders by taxing the middle class? How does that help the middle class?
@djpjr4 it's not about taxing the middle class it's about making the 1% pay their fair share in taxes We all need to pay so America can live
@JohnWusah @BarackObama bernie's tax of the 1% doesn't pay for all his freebies unless the middle class is taxed and we're already paying$$$
@djpjr4 how much do you earn a year. And you are paying money yet the 1% doesn't pay nearly as much. I come from wealth, I know first hand.
@JohnWusah I'm not saying don't raise the 1%, don't raise the middle class. Paying about 1/3 of my salary to feds. How about you?
@djpjr4 plus you will be getting single payer Health care that'll save you 1000s. I'd rather have that than to pay unregulated health costs
@BarackObama You are insane my Health insurance rates copays have tripled since 08 & your middle class economics wages have stayed same! wtf
@BarackObama I mean smile all you want it's not good out here. That DC protected bubble you're living in yea, out here the struggle is real
@BarackObama Those #'s are Bullshit anyways 95 mil not even trying to get jobs it's easier and pays more to suck of the teat of your policy
@binksbuddie @BarackObama 95 Million? that is 1/3 the population bud...
@LowLoweLower So "bud"you can do math now research and you will find the stats @BarackObama labor dept?
@binksbuddie I only think that because of page 16 of this analysis: https://www.azmag.gov/Documents/EDC_2015-03-03_Item-05_What-to-Make-of-This-Economy-Presentation.pdf …
@BarackObama SMOKE AND MIRRORS  AND LIES OF THE LEFTIST  ELITE  AND GLOBALIST  THIEVES

@BarackObama no its not!
@BarackObama 8 years? So it was at a peak low at the start of your term and then you've just now managed to restore it to that?
@Pierce7d @BarackObama hun unemployment was near 9% at the start of his term..if its cut in half he did a good
@Egyptwilliams4 @BarackObama In that case, why do we underrepresent his progress by claiming it has been 8 years if it's been longer?
@Pierce7d @BarackObama he's only been in office 7 and half years so nothing is being under represented
@BarackObama Not for anyone I know.
@BarackObama

@BarackObama your high! You must be smoking pot. You have destroyed the middle class. Who the hell are you talking to?
@BarackObama FOR WHICH COUNTRY
@BarackObama ...tireshare maintence fees are paid by upper middle class..they are suffering financial burden..they cant pay their time shire

@BarackObama which means more debt to corporate owners ..which they owe over seas
@BarackObama Not true
@BarackObama Congrats Mr president. That's a positive point of your administration.
@BarackObama That's not counting how many people stopped looking for a job. It also doesn't tell us how many underemployed there are.  Liar!
@BarackObama Hello!

@BarackObama I for one think you are the worst thing thing to happen to this country since President Clinton and her husband.
@BarackObama unemployment isn't down. You've just got people living off the government. That's worse than unemployed.
@BarackObama You are a liar.
@BarackObama your lying joke! Like if you say it, it must be true!! Not!
@BarackObama sir we have Secure Magazine the only security magazine in East and Central African want it to be USA
@BarackObama biggest lie
@BarackObama The Middle Class is becoming EXTINCT, you privileged sorry excuse for a President. You created Division of American Citizens.
@BarackObama No it is not when kids still live with parents because of the job market and parents do not get tax break for older kids
@BarackObama лохонулся щоль?
@BarackObama yeah it helps that we have so many on food stamps and government assistance.  Otherwise that number would be much worse!
@BarackObama . Mideel class who thoot work is worshipp
@BarackObama congratulations on not screwing things up as bad as FDR, I guess?
@BarackObama   good job
@BarackObama Unemployment is gauged by those not on it. You can only get it for so long. People have exhausted it.This does not = jobs
@BarackObama it is NOT working. I am lower middle class and work. My paycheck is gone as soon as I get it. Many lower middle class struggle
@BarackObama glad there are jobs but the middle class is not working because the jobs don't pay well. We need better paying jobs.

@BarackObama Holisss
@BarackObama is true
@BarackObama 威武支持有希望
@BarackObama well yeah, you cut hours by 25%(from 40 to 28) but only increased number of jobs by <5% thats what we in the real world call F-
@BarackObama Good Job! If you can point Loretta Lynch at Rick Scott 2 come & take him away along w the crooked @FloridaGOP we would flourish
@BarackObama you do know that this figure leaves a LOT of people out, including the "underemployed," right? It's still good news,
@BarackObama ...but it's not as rosy as it seems.
@BarackObama wow, delusion much?
@BarackObama If you say it, they will believe it. A stragedy that has worked very well for you. Nobody else, but you.

@BarackObama this  yemen .it is time to stop the war
@BarackObama stop the war in yemen
@BarackObama middle class is working... working hard to finance your handouts to the lazy lower class through healthcare taxes.
@BarackObama as the economy fluctuates, so does employment. @POTUS did nothing to help. If anything, obama hindered it.
@BarackObama if these numbers are true, it's probably because full timers had hours cut to circumvent obamacare thus more part timers needed
@BarackObama i#why is there no talk in this election campaign on how to get rid of AMT - most Americans don't know we get taxed twice
@BarackObama NOT TRUE!
@BarackObama which is a lie.  That's only people collecting unemployment.  It's closer to 10.5%.
@BarackObama congrulations 
@BarackObama Really? Everybody is dropping debt as in credit card debt
Of course you love their interest and fees
@BarackObama Yes, Mr. President it is. Thanks to you caring and your vision. God Bless you for staying focused.
@BarackObama really??? I'm considered lower-middle class and live from paycheck to paycheck.
@BarackObama when a black man manage some thing, he's certainly skilled in.
@BarackObama after 8 years, trickle-down economics would be more accurate unfortunately
@BarackObama Well-done!you did a great Job keep it up, Thank you very Much

@BarackObama @Alasscan_ I heard Bernie Sanders sloughed this off? Grrrr!  #POTUS Please Endorse and  #FightForHillary
@BarackObama certainly not here in NJ/Christies catastrophic economic failure.  $50k a year can't feed your family or pay a utility bill.

@BarackObama Sadly, Americans have not yet learned that the executive branch is not the only branch of American government. #obstructionist
@BarackObama Thnks Mr. President!
@BarackObama You're the only one saying economy is good for middle class.  We all know better.  You're the worst president in history!
@BarackObama Please stop blaming Bush for bad economy.  It's on you almost a decade later.  Grow up!
@BarackObama Soon we'll be at 0 unemployment, 0 employment. When 20% of workers quit looking, and you count only those looking, great #'s
@BarackObama Go head #Prez!
@BarackObama @whitehouse OK!  Because you say it, we'll all believe it.
@BarackObama numbers don't lie, especially if they are accurate.
@BarackObama تستحق  الأفضل  فخامة الرئيس  لأنك  ادرت  ببراعة  ملفات  الشرق الأوسط  ...و الملف  الإيراني  وجنبت  بلادك  معارك  عنيفة
