@BarackObama Great idea.Now those two years of education went from meaning "this much" to absolutely nothing now but a standard. Ridiculous
@B_Mitch6 @BarackObama not sure if I would dub it "ridiculous", my friend.
@Lanzon5 @BarackObama too much to say over Twitter it would be multiple tweets, more than I am willing to type out right now. Haha.
@B_Mitch6 @BarackObama  had to insert my two sense brotha.. That's where intelligence stems from, critical thinking like this right here
@Lanzon5 @BarackObama I remember when you and I first developed critical thinking back in grade school, you can even name the class.
@B_Mitch6 @BarackObama Mrs. Brophy's? 
@BarackObama NO SAY THE GREEDY!  THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN SPOILED LITTLE PUNK KIDS AND F. EVERYBODY ELSE. GOP/SUX!
@CannabisNow2016 I worked and took out loans for my degrees !
@BarackObama @jmh_xo  you keep using that word I do not think you know what it means.
@jmh_xo @BarackObama "free". If we go to the movies and I pay for you it doesn't mean the movie was free. It just didn't cost you anything.
@jmh_xo He is proposing the government pay for the two years of college and calling it free college. Not even sure why it should be free?
@BarackObama @themiamivoice what a joke!!
“@BarackObama: "Four years of college at a private university should be as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama”

@BarackObama @Bernie_B_Good98
@BarackObama This #CollegeOpportunity is a great start towards making education more accessible to everyone! After all, knowledge is power!
“@BarackObama: "Two years of community college should be as free and universal as high school is today.—Obama" High school isn't free.
@BarackObama @757hank Its not free you morons, people who work pay for it, to tak on the added cost, higher taxes.
@FaroeNik @BarackObama lol.. Make more, get taxed more. I never hear those people complain when they donate 50grand to their fave politician
@757hank @BarackObama I never donated 50k to anyone, save Vandy every year for kids college education. See taxes in Denmark for costs
@FaroeNik @BarackObama doesn't have to be specific to you.. Free education is a great idea. If Ucan afford 50k 4kids college, pay more Taxes
@757hank @BarackObama Want2 pay 25% sales tax 59% income tax thats how socialism costs, because I can pay more doesnt mean i should pay more
@FaroeNik @BarackObama of whom much is given, much is expected. Of u can afford 50k for college, you should pay more in taxes..
@757hank @BarackObama I see you cannot answer this, what a shock.Liberals always give up or scream racism when they cannot answer.
@BarackObama i am a nigeria who want to benefits from this opportunity .Please i need help..
@BarackObama TEACHERS LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS NEEDS TO BE MORE LIBERAL....THOSE OF US IN CHALLENGE SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING...HELP

Wellcome to Viet Nam :3 
http://www.danangdulich.com/du-lich-ba-na.html …
@BarackObama thank you mr president
@BarackObama no thanks, guess who has to fund that? We do with taxes
@BarackObama ...and no doubt these government schools will indoctrinate our young people with your socialistic and anti-family ideology.
@BarackObama Many are NOT college material and will not be serious about learning!  What kind of doctor or surgeon would they be?
@BarackObama Seems to me that you think, since many could not pass entrance exam, you will get them in for free.  Dumb move!
@BarackObama NEVER!  If College were free, it would just be another playground for them and they would NOT learn much!
@BarackObama along with 2yrs of loan forgiveness for everyone else, right? You've got to level the playing field for everyone, right? Right?
@BarackObama Don't even consider it unless they maintain a 3.8 GPA, give 2 years to volunteer work & have random drug testing during college
@BarackObama bless this tweet
@BarackObama @DianeGCibrian Maybe we can get the #Saudis to pay for it. USA is broke people.
“@BarackObama: @PMOIndia For us to follow -2yrs of com college should be as free as high school is todayPresident Obama #CollegeOpportunity”
@BarackObama с большим уважением отношусь к вам. Удачи вам и вашей семье.
@BarackObama all PUBLIC schools (including 4 year colleges/universities) should be FREE! That is what #publiceducation should mean.
@BarackObama I disagree. People that go to college should appreciate it. Things are appreciated more if they are worked for. Earn your way
@BarackObama I agree. This is the 21st century, education must be 1st priority.
@BarackObama Let's also force people to pay/attend college-if they don't, let's tax them! Better than your shit health insurance scam. U POS
@BarackObama should should should... We should be united and not worry about currency either- fix that, won't ya?
@BarackObama Does that apply for international students aw well?
@BarackObama I think this the best thing you can do for our beloved kids and hopefully the university too
@BarackObama if government high school was worth a shit we wouldn't need college would we? Government college is just as worthless
@BarackObama You are so very generous with what little money I have. And no I can pay my own way I am a grown man! Why 2 just make it 4 year
@BarackObama community college was very nearly free at El Camino CC when I went in 1983....
@BarackObama why not 4 years?
@BarackObama in Finland we have free schools. If you want you can study in any level. #OKM. We are small country but education system is OK
@BarackObama your an idiot
@BarackObama No. It should not. This is ideology. You have yet to lay out any reasonable case. Just saying something doesn't make it right.
@BarackObama this is good decision for all.please follow this thought by development country also for strong development
@BarackObama Really want to talk to @JJAProf911 about thoughts on this statement. Not sure of potential consequences.
@BarackObama @jason_velocity why?  Maybe a high school should be of better quality...
@SDenmeade @BarackObama High schools would have to be two years longer to add two more years of education. Not bad idea, but different.
@BarackObama It used to be free, when I attended community college. Then it started $5 a unit. Not bad, then got more and more $$$$$$. :(
@BarackObama so out of touch.
@BarackObama What about skills such as carpentry, plumbing, electrical and truck driving?  Different folks have different abilities 2 offer!
@BarackObama when exactly are you going to make this happen? I'm starting to go to college. #CollegeOpportunity
@BarackObama As A Student In College I Definitely Agree!
@BarackObama -if public schools can't get the funding they need what makes you think colleges can?
@BarackObama my brother and I had to pay for high school because the free ones didn't accept that we didn't learn inside the box. Thoughts?
@BarackObama community college has changed my life tremendously. All students should have this opportunity. Education = empowerment
@BarackObama @Ralphie_May at 49 years old, I could achieve my goal of going to school.. And I would make all A's
@BarackObama.good option to this generation
@BarackObama pay my student loansss
@BarackObama Only if you and Michelle pay the bill, as most don't even finish HS and some less than that
@BarackObama YAAAS Mr. President!!! PREACH!!!
@BarackObama #CollegeOpportunity a key way to move North America forward....
@BarackObama what cuts are you making to find this?
.@BarackObama shut up
@barackobama @adapteva Is Obama paying the bill?
@BarackObama My taxes pay 4 public school and now more of my money can pay 4 more free school.Can I get a tax credit for what I paid 4 mine?
@BarackObama It's not free someone has to pay for these programs! Taxpayers
“@BarackObama: "Two years of community college should be as free and universal as high school is today." 4 year colleges too plzz 
@BarackObama nothing is free hard working tax payers will pay for it
@BarackObama It won't be free. Someone has to pay for it. So really what your saying is for a lot of people it's going to get very expensive
@BarackObama fafsa easy%living standards needed.free can help me_6 tax brackets though
There's that word again: FREE
@BarackObama: "Two years of community college should be as free and universal as high school is today." —Obama
@BarackObama 2/2 Free college education is a must. High GPA should come hand to hand as well.
@BarackObama there are many students that need money for education. But also there are a lot of them that are not taking it seriously.  1/2
@BarackObama will you hire Ray Watts please?  Please take him so we can #freeuab and #fireraywatts.
@BarackObama @SteveBelow Umm, no.
@SteveBelow Its a great concept, but as we know, nothing is free. Tax payers foot the bill.
@BarackObama cleaning from top to bottom.
@BarackObama WELL THEN ACCORDING TO OBAMA..TRADES OUGHT TO BE FREE TOO AND ONLINE EDUCATION FOR TWO YEARS? HE'S A NUT!!
@BarackObama as great as that sounds, it wouldn't be free. That kind of stuff costs money. Tax payer money.
@BarackObama well no fucking shit
@BarackObama I was looking over a Bill on the Senate Agenda relating to the same matter.  I totally agree.
@BarackObama high school isn't free and never has been, taxes pay for it, which continue to rise
@BarackObama It is not free, please stop playing that card. Nothing the govt provides is free, we the people are paying for it. #BeHonest
@BarackObama Last time I checked I paid taxes that go toward funding public schools
@BarackObama Kindergarten is not FREE.
@BarackObama Why, so people can catch up to 12th grade because high schools are underfunded?
@BarackObama Again...Who is going to pay for that
@BarackObama  sometimes people don't cherish what is easily obtained.
@BarackObama please president Obama. please :(
@BarackObama agreed, but can you wrap it up here in Birmingham. They won't let us on the interstate. I just want to go home.
@BarackObama 2 years community college free &universal GOOD, four years college BETTER #collegeopportunity
@BarackObama @Ralphie_May so can you lower my payments on my student loans Mr President
@BarackObama @Ralphie_May Yeah but...
@BarackObama @MiaFarrow also as bad
@BarackObama focus on the artificial cost of tuition increases before free CC. Hold universities accountable for those unnecessary increases
@BarackObama
@BarackObama So, who is going to pay for it?
@BarackObama Absolutely
@BarackObama Solo los brutos e incultos desean seguir en ese estado x ese motivo insultan. Prefieren subsidios al trabajo honesto.
@BarackObama 
You're a socialist. Everything is free for the free loaders. Move to Yemen and take your family there with you.
@BarackObama En ARG tenemos todo "gratis", Primaria, Secundaria y Universidad. Pero C/día somos más populistas e incultos! Saludos
@BarackObama but highschool is not free. It is expensive. The taxes for highschools alone are crippling some folks.
@BarackObama #CollegeOpportunity who is going to pay for this middle class is already paying 42% in taxes.
@BarackObama @Ralphie_May how about the 100k I owe in student loans from a university?
@BarackObama Mr President are you watching David Cameroon vs Ed Milliband on Skynews UK
@BarackObama education requirements have changed greatly in the past 5 decades. How far do we need to go to train workers?
@BarackObama re: 2 yrs free community college. This is called CEGEP in Quebec, Canada and it works very well. #CollegeOpportunity
"@BarackObama: "2 years of community college should be as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama #CollegeOpportunity"
@BarackObama High School is NOT FREE. We Tax Payers PAY FOR IT!!!
@BarackObama we cant afford it
@BarackObama when will you tell you're ppl you are gay and ur wife is a man it's so obvious
@BarackObama 
When will you stop leading you're country on the wrong path? When will you stop deceiving  everyone?
@BarackObama A College Professor told me when she was in her teens, in the the early 60's, community college was free, what happened?
@BarackObama #StopobamasSpinDoctoring
@BarackObama This is the greatest priority. Students of color currently greatly burdened by student debt.
@BarackObama 1st, high school IS NOT free in Cali if your a citizen! 2nd your "free college" plan puts a huge strain on the middle class!
@BarackObama I don't agree.
@BarackObama I agree
@BarackObama I agree 100x over!!!
@BarackObama in a few years my taxes will be paying for this, I will still owe on my student loans, and paying for my sons non comm coll.
@BarackObama why only 2 years? why only community college?
@BarackObama and of  course, it will be paid for with higher taxes.
@BarackObama If France could think so !
@BarackObama haha this is comical.
@BarackObama HS IS NOT FREE YOU FREAKING BONEHEAD! TAXES PAID BY HOMEOWNERS PAYS! G-D you are dumb as a box of rocks
 ok “@BarackObama: "Two years of community college should be as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama"
@BarackObama ...if you fix the EBT like use of the Pell Grant.
Deve ser um direito de todos. Para elevar o nível critico. Sem boa critica erramos muito. @BarackObama
@BarackObama @TaylorMurdock12 University of Phoenix gonna HATE this retweet!  :-)
@BarackObama That sounds expensive. Let's promote vocational schools while the laddies are still in high school. Who you got tonight? Ky/WV
@BarackObama College is such a scary thought for me I'm so afraid that I'm not smart enough or I won't have enough money to attend.
@BarackObama I agree. I also believe that educational systems should be mandated to teach students about taxes and other real-life subjects.
@BarackObama i want to come to learn from usa,the study standard is quite better thn all around the world,quite competetive but visa refused
@BarackObama @jblauphoto What would be great is relief for those who are struggling with loans from the days when no such program existed.
@lancekingphoto @BarackObama - Good point. But I'm flattered that you'd put me and the President in the same company.
@jblauphoto @BarackObama Ha! ;)
@BarackObama if the 2yrs of college is not accepted they should provide certificate programs in high school; e.g EMT.
@BarackObama it will also be equivalent in value
@BarackObama so being specific who paying for this? Why your own party never approved your budget proposals
@BarackObama That's a neat notion that would be a great start for many and we in the UK should take this on board also
@BarackObama well I've done 3 and a half and still have 2 more so when can I get my refund....?
@BarackObama Our Liar&Chief is awesome when it comes to SOPM (spending other people's money).  Can you say "more debt" "Raise taxes") ..WTF
@BarackObama ummm I pay for high school via property taxes.... So what new tax is going to pay for this nonsense...
@BarackObama
@BarackObama nothing is free and I have my own family to get through school. About to quit paying tax altogether.
@BarackObama you socialist leftards are stupid all over the globe...
@BarackObama #SlowClap

@BarackObama hey, how about the equivalent of two years of college in high school as well since kids don't learn anything in high school?
@BarackObama why
@barackobama hapo sawa Joh! keep up da good work.
@BarackObama will I get reimbursed for my two years?
@BarackObama but what about four year programs?masters level?dont penalize achievement by rewarding minimal standards.
@BarackObama @Durrtydoesit free? Yes. Mandatory? No
@BarackObama That would be great. Many people would love to further their education, but money is an issue. 2 years will make a difference!

@BarackObama President Obama please make community college free for everybody
@BarackObama , College should be free, that's it. Access to Education should be equal
@BarackObama education at 4 year institutions should be free as well #collegeopportunity no student should have to struggle for tuition
@BarackObama Public schools are a mess.
Son's parochial school is not free, but offers freedom
@BarackObama  so you'll forgive that student loan I took out for community college years ago right? Cool, thanks
@BarackObama nothing is free, someone has to pay for it
