@BarackObama Immigration is a problem everywhere. But the problem you're having is the fault and incompetence of the Republican Party.
@ls_elisaDalien @BarackObama why let them be here illegally? To cost the working tax paying class to support the freeloaders? No thanks
@ls_elisaDalien @BarackObama no, they're going to sit on their asses and have us cater to them with welfare govt housing etc
@BarackObama Dear President Obama 
When Are you going to help All these immigrants in need ?
@Fernanda_Dolan @BarackObama  When they stop committing felonies by crossing the border illegally
@dironman34 @BarackObama people like you saying all these hateful things about them , we're all the humans & we should all be respected !!
@Fernanda_Dolan @BarackObama  its not hateful to point out criminality. Civilized humans follow the laws.
@dironman34 @BarackObama families. STOP HATING ON THEM ! I swear people like you make me so mad 
@Fernanda_Dolan  I dont hate them.Also most illegals arent mexican anymore because they have options in mexico now like foodstamps

@BarackObama, many more people need to become USA citizen, but they can because the price of it.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama They're all acting. Our government does not serve the people. They just pretend to.
@BarackObama America has always used the potential of its citizens without distinction of origin,regularize immigration would be beneficial
@BarackObama put all ethnicities where they belong. What made America was Irish Germans Italians a Polish and Africans. Leave it that way!!
@BarackObama No. We need to make them follow our laws. Period. Came here illegally? Go home and come back the right way.
@BarackObama prove it
@BarackObama the work of Wall Street has been most successful because of you! You may have destroyed us and you're legacy will prove that!
@BarackObama it's broken because you made immigration possible 41.3 million immigrants came to the US since 2013 rly?
