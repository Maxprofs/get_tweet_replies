@OFA you have not constitutional choice but to stand idly by.
My prediction? Come November 9th, they'l hurry up and okay Garland before Hillary gets a pick.
Isn't it fun to pick and choose which political game is okay and which isn't!? Good job subjugating American freedoms to UN.

hey @BarackObama what
about the DOJ's blind
obstruction of prosecuting
WFB executives for
widespread fraud?
The strategy of shaming the @SenateGOP doesn't seem to work.  Only humans (and some dogs) feel shame.  We have Mitch McConnell.

@OFA  Obama ya müddefik olan Türkiye nin yanında ol Yada Fetö pkk daeş pyd nin yanında iki yüzlü olmayın  Tarafın Hangisi ?????

@OFA your very existence is a dangerous precedent to the well being of this once great nation
@OFA - oh yes we can stand idly by. DJT will nominate a judge after he takes office in January.
It is for greater good, Hussain.
I read this too fast and my brain said "wait, we nominated Judy Garland for the Supreme Court?"
& @HillaryClinton's blind obstruction of Judge Alito's nomination set a dangerous precedent:

@OFA America doesn't want anyone you nominate
@OFA President TRUMP will appoint someone. So you just sit tight. You've done enough damage already.
Sad that Senate openly undermined the Prez Discretionary Powers enshrined in the US Constitution over Justice Garland Issue!
oh... i notice he is jewish & more importantly went to harvard, he sounds intelligent , no wonder they dont want him in there
What concerns me is what happens if this election turns out like Bush vs Gore!!!!!
@OFA @SenateMajLdr I think he means you Mitch!

Like you speak up for a fair America????!
The honest truth Obama is the system was put into place for a reason ... NOT your reasons!
Right
Your Sister Souljah moment has arrived @BarackObama #CharlotteProtests #CharlotteRiots
But you'll push a dangerous trade deal and expanded mass surveillance.... hm...
@OFA Sir, your country is going to hell in a hand cart. I predict that the #USA will have a very challenging decade ahead
@OFA Why don't you try to acknowledge the racial divide you threw gas on past 7 years?  Isn't that important too?
hey @BarackObama what about the DOJ's blind obstruction of prosecuting WFB executives for widespread fraud?
@OFA it serves you rite u ignored them for 7 years
