@BarackObama Thanks, POTUS, for making us work harder to pay for this added perk for bureaucrats.
@Dougsbriefcase @BarackObama... Reading is helpful... It's not Bureaucrats it's the contractors. Gvt. employees get time off.
@SherwoodRN @BarackObama Many contractors are retired bureaucrats. He's raising costs of fedl projects, which already pay union scale.
