@BarackObama Rounded out to the nearest full percentage point, solar and wind power now supply 1% and 0% of our energy needs.
@Senator_Assange have you got a source for that?
@Jarred1337 The percentages bounce around a bit, but that's the gist of it http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/topics/encyclopedia/solar/ …
@Senator_Assange thanks :)
@Jarred1337 You're welcome.
@BarackObama @Beckysgoingrtw solar panels are great... But how do they stop the world from spinning? #cycleoflife

@BarackObama If we were vegan, California would not be having a water shortage problem. 2,500 gallons of water for one pound of meat. - HI
@BarackObama If we were vegan we could reforest 70% of American crop lands currently used to support meat production to balance our climate.
@BarackObama The single most effective thing we can do to stop climate change is to stop producing & eating meat. Plant trees instead. - HI

@BarackObama the skullywogs!
@BarackObama  i am chinese student
@BarackObama thanks and regards
@BarackObama hope Mr President might have put some covers for me also. US is a democratic country and I do expect them having some values...
@BarackObama as always, organizers have prepared a 'platform' to do anything with me, good or bad both. and its only on US, what they allow
@BarackObama many years hav gone like this,along with taking over my assets in India itself,while using my family as robots in front of mine
@BarackObama breaking mentally/financially,physical torture-dreams-threatening on roads for years, waiting for me to reach a breaking point?
@BarackObama and i dont understand, after wasting billions of dollars, what organizers would achieve once im left with no money? shameful...
@BarackObama while im intentionally kept in the current state????
@BarackObama foreign intelligence are allowed to trap me, who are backed by US/UK also, but no defence for a civilian?
@BarackObama and which "reason" the US itself pick, whether to harm me or let me back on my life after over 7 years, is my worries,as always
@BarackObama rest im preparing myself for Vietnam, applying for jobs in india too. i always have a reason to help myself from bluffs
@BarackObama delivering wrong information to common public, using my IDs to do crimes, as funded by US's annual budget, is no more a secret
@BarackObama even if common people gets mobilized against me, its again because they are guided to do so, under 'democratic' steps
@BarackObama its only the people of US/UK everywhere, which includes both, who may harm or help me. and its just depends, whom you allow....
@BarackObama I hope im not kept for years to be finally punished for the failures of organizers. thats a shame for organizing nations US/UK
@BarackObama there must always be a reason to take me out of the shiits, i couldn't avoid to date. I cooperate and you must help me. thanks
@BarackObama my current state is intended, it wasn't a doubt since 2007 itself. and i do hope to back on my life
@BarackObama an 'Indefensible' man would always cooperate, i know.and I must be defended in any case, you are directly responsible to ensure
@BarackObama earth quake/Tsunami threats on Indian civilians to keep helping these foreign infiltrators survive somehow.... shameful
@BarackObama Bangladeshi+Pak infiltrators hiding under False Indian-Hindu names, only have pig-dog death, once US/UK refuse to support them
@BarackObama i always advice to help Bangladesh in Bangladesh, Pakistan in Pakistan, as compare to help these rogue nations in India
@BarackObama if I need security then i would be provided with that, other than use Muslim terrorists of Bangladesh+Pakistan to threaten me
@BarackObama no one can help me but anyone can harm me, while im intentionally kept like this? the only politics behind all bluffs, shameful
@BarackObama hence when i only begged to come out of these things, you are directly responsible for anything ever happened, on going
@BarackObama did my political statements result in violence on streets? which was intended to do so to keep me like this for years? and why?
@BarackObama and US is responsible to prove that they never used all the systems/funds to fight with a single civilian only for over 7 years
@BarackObama nabion la hussein abi (lan demedim, follow?)
@BarackObama my letters to presidents/ PMs of world is meant to come out of these things 'immediately', its no secret.why im kept like this?
@BarackObama my involvements are limited to the period im kept like this.United State is entirely responsible for anything happens till then
@BarackObama im only trying to defend myself, to take me out of these unwanted involvements
@BarackObama after years of struggle with me, current state of organizers is, make false statements by using my IDs. here they finally stand
@BarackObama good day sir
