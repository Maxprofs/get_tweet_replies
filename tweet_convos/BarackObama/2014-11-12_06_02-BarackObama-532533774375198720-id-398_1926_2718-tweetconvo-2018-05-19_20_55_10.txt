@barackobama @kissstephanie LOL! You can hear the Chinese laughing at us from here. Pathetic.
@hoytc55 Ignorant #ClimateChange deniers, such as yourself, are slowly becoming extinct thankfully.  @BarackObama #AGW
@kissstephanie Satellites aren't partisan nor are they enviro-extremists.
@hoytc55 Yep, satellite data very clearly shows Earth has definitely warmed since 1998: http://goo.gl/9FQ6BO  #AGW #ClimateChange
@kissstephanie Enjoy the cult. Free country.
@hoytc55 #ClimateChange is science, but climate change denial is a religious cult created on misinformation & fairy tales by polluters. #AGW
@kissstephanie You can't deny something that hasn't happened. Even your global warming cultist friends admit no global warming for 18 yrs.
Thanks, Mr. President MT @BarackObama: The US & China have agreed on an ambitious joint plan to cut carbon pollution. http://ofa.bo/b1ZE 
@progressive_va China will have to reach PEAK output by 2030, they can emit more and more up to 2030 then stop the grwth from that level.
@DonHanke, No, you can't meet a big 2030 goal by doing absolutely nothing for 16 years. BTW, China already world leader on renewable energy.
@progressive_va their goal is to peak by 2030 then stop the growth
@DonHanke, you honestly think that the world's second largest economy can suddenly make such a massive transition in one year or less?
@progressive_va of course not, that's the point.
@DonHanke, If they allow us to take the lead on renewable energy technology & efficiency, that will be a great boost for US competitiveness.
@progressive_va can't trust China they are too good at making up numbers.... on everything.
@BarackObama No, China is going to increase for 16 more years, you are screwing the US
@mazqr8dz @BarackObama China plans to increase carbon output for another 16 years, while we are supposed to cut ours. Helluva deal.
@mazqr8dz Well, that is their job...
@BarackObama China agreed to almost nothing, projecting small cut in carbon pollution by 2030 while the U.S. plans on cutting 25%
@barackobama i like you long life for you

@BarackObama Excellent Work!!! :D  Now let's challenge future leaders to make the past look like nothing compared to the future!!!
@BarackObama Rather than to think that we were misguided and are responsible for an unnecessary commitment of their life's work.
@BarackObama The best legacy is for future generations to build off of our foundation and consider our work elementary to their success...
@BarackObama Which is how it should be.
@BarackObama A milestone compared to where we've been, but just the very beginning compared to where we must go.
@BarackObama Yet I believe that this is most analogous to a graduation commencement...
@BarackObama I was wondering when you'd get around to mentioning that.  Well Done!!! :D
@BarackObama it's a start. Any movement is forward movement for children.
