That's why we must #uniteblue in Nov! It's abt more than pers. preference. It's abt health of our country (as a Bernie voter).
@DoloresHuerta totally agree.  Go with the candidate who firmly beats Trump

@BarackObama You've already done enough #harm to #America. #GoAway
: Lady take a look in the mirror. You are looking at DEPLORABLE!!!
Lady... look in the mirror @GwenBradley16, you're most probably a paid #egg. @BarackObama
I'm getting tired of these eggs, they're like the catfish predators that stalk children online
Also the fact that they are most likely paid #Hilbot trolls... #DrainTheSwamp
They're "most likely" paid like those who caused disruptions at the campaign & town hall meetings
@BarackObama "Do your job"?  YOU calling on others to do their job.  That's funny and ironic.
Sucks to suck
I welcome the change in the supreme court.

@BarackObama @DoloresHuerta @FoxNews Obama needs liberalJudge to help continue to hideHis secrete lost Fast&FuriousGuns1000's mex GENOCIDE
@BarackObama @mtmcelvy  He's done enough damage to the country already
. @BarackObama retweet if you think all Obama does is play games with our future.
. @BostonSnob that's right! You tell Obama! Good job!
@BostonSnob @PoliticalCow interesting jump to conclusions.  Aren't the ones without a job or a life, or want free eductation voting dem?
@GuyRWhitehead @BostonSnob @PoliticalCow 
What is eductation? Is that anything like lactation?
@pizzmoe @BostonSnob @PoliticalCow well, if it's sucking off of the tit, the dems know it better than anyone
@GuyRWhitehead @BostonSnob @PoliticalCow 
You do know the red states are much bigger "tit suckers" than the blue states, right?Of course not
Is Bannon covering up reapproachment with DPRK because he wants DPRK to hack voter data?
You should say that if Hillary wins in November you'll let her pick the next justice and you'll pull Garland.
@BarackObama @janet_sistare So called "progressive" POTUS "doing his job" by nominating a Republican for Supreme Court - yeah fucking right
@skepticsauce @BarackObama 
Nah, I think that was just a name floated to show how intransigent the GOP is being.
@janet_sistare @BarackObama I hope you're right! It would be highly upsetting if he was serious.
@BarackObama I'm french but I'm also interested in the political life of another country and I agree with you.
@pauline07119255  France is being taken over by refugees opening up no go zones and Obama wants to do the same thing here. #dontbeapuppet
@ScottMichaels31 refugees are humans and they need our help.
@pauline07119255 agreed but Mecca has 2,000,000 places that aren't being used. You should not be afraid to walk your own country's streets.
@ScottMichaels31 of course. But your president is a good and responsable person. Our president in France makes a lot of mistakes...
@pauline07119255 agreed, I just don't want them repeated here.
@ScottMichaels31 I agree with your president because even if I'm not american, everyone can live free and too many people have arms against
@pauline07119255 I have arms because I'm free. I can protect my family. Those rights should not be tread upon.
@BarackObama @DoloresHuerta treason

@BarackObama #Isurehopetheydo
@BarackObama you are absolutely correct!!
@BarackObama @reevynap POTUS has high hopes.The only job they've been doing since he FIRST took office was to undermine/block/undo his job.
@BarackObama No matter what is going on in your life, never lose hope.  Stay positive , stay humble in good times, and always trust Allah.
@BarackObama thank u for all u do. The #Senate needs to do their job.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama go get them

@BarackObama If the POTUS nominates Supreme Court Judge and the Senate doesn't hold confirmation hearings, isn't that an implicit yes vote?
