@BarackObama It would be nice if everybody can have that opportunity but not many can afford it. Education should be free BC is a right!
@canelonzita you don't have a right to a teacher's labor(slavery). There is opportunity; get a job, save up $, go to less expensive college.
@Mermaz how about people with no opportunities because they need to help their family? Our society should stop being so self centered
@canelonzita people always have an opportunity to educate themselves. They can read on the internet or go to the library for example.
@Mermaz sure, it will be a good source to put in a resume when searching for a job. The whole idea is to be able to succeed economically
@canelonzita A degree may get your foot in the door, but so does any work experience. If you can show you're a hard worker it may mean more.
@BarackObama Really? You went to Harvard and you've done more destruction to America than Hitler did to the entire world over his life time!
@BarackObama #funn

@BarackObama Peaple keep telling me that ur an illumanati is that true?
@BarackObama its ture
@BarackObama Nuclear weapons and other WMDs were created by people with higher education
@BarackObama Yes if higher education is based on moral values.
@BarackObama If only the #Republican party was on board, we could be soaring to new heights
@BarackObama I agree, because when people are higher educated, they can create more innovative products.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Healthiness is the Utmost Benefit. Pleasure is the Utmost Wealth. Trustworthiness is the Utmost Relative.
@BarackObama Not when we have thousands of dollars in loan debt to get through in order to start a life after schools over.
@barackobama

@BarackObama
@BarackObama Close Quantanamo Bay, beat IS on the ground and Putin in jail.
@BarackObama  ALSO BELIEVE BUT IN INDIA EDUCATION FEE IS  VERY HIGH & OWNER OF SCHOOL/COLLAGE INVESTMENTS ONLY FOR EARN MONEY 5TIMES IN YEAR
@BarackObama IDIAN GOVERMENT TILL DATE FAIL TO PROVIDE BETTER SCHOOL/HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR ALL PEOPLES DUE TO POOR FAMILY NOT PROGRESS
@BarackObama can you share that with @dougducey as he and the AZ State Leg dismantle higher education?

“@BarackObama: "I believe that higher education is one of the best investments anybody can make in their future." —President Obama
@BarackObama your correct. but difficult to invest
@BarackObama The higher education is like the gold bracelet for kids..
@BarackObama
@BarackObama You told the students nothing new. They know that higher education is a way up the economic ladder.
@BarackObama I have not had a raise in 6 years.  I have a BA, I have never collected unemployment and could not afford to live on my own.
@BarackObama # Education gives us the knowledge of  humanity and by this we can understand the right and wrong way  .
@BarackObama la vaina es que no es gratis como aquí en Venezuela!
@BarackObama I strongly support you words
@BarackObama sir your thinning is too good but in the Field of educated do something take some important decision's for all of us
@BarackObama then make them earn it, don't give it away. Good things aren't cheap and cheap things aren't good!
@AMKennedy614 @BarackObama too bad our govt is the only one that CHARGES us and continues raising the price for our education! THANKS OBAMA
@mckindependence @BarackObama acquiring thousands of debt is probably the exact opposite of a best investment for our age group.
@AMKennedy614 @BarackObama girrrrrl don't even get me started lol
@BarackObama Provided What you get in return and at what age ?
“@BarackObama: "I believe that higher education is one of the best investments anybody can make in their future"#CollegeOpportunity @gloscol

@BarackObama Mr.yes home work and respect # college opportunity.
@BarackObama shut the fuck up
.@BarackObama Mr. President - the majority in the Arizona State Legislature appears to be diametrically opposed to this idea. #AZBackwards
@SteveWeichert We really need  @BarackObama to come out against higher ed. Then @dougducey & the AZ GOP would quadruple higher ed spending!!
@BarackObama #CollegeOpportunity 
@BarackObama that's what my mom says #twins
“@BarackObama: "I believe that higher education is one of the best investments anybody can make in their future." Do do I :)

@BarackObama More than higher, INTELIGENT: fiancial wisdom and concretes knowledges, self-love and self-respect, Earth and ecology...etc.
@BarackObama thanks obama
@BarackObama I believe a mass higher education is a socialist way to think about. Not anybody is good for universities.
@BarackObama OK, give me an opportunity.
@BarackObama ありがとうございます。本人が希望するのに親戚が阻止するなどということが無い状況を望みます。
@BarackObama Yeah but it is nearly impossible to afford and when you do get there, you come out with a whole lot of student debt and loans.
@BarackObama education key to success!
@BarackObama america latina es tierra de paz. Déjenos vivir en paz.
@BarackObama
Evet,Yüksek eytimde dünyada biricisniz.mister @BarackObama  Peki bu eytim sisteminizden neden BARIŞ sever insanlar yetişmiyor?
@BarackObama strongly agree
@BarackObama that's relative...for example, here we have Enrique Peña Nieto as president,being one of the less preparated persons in México.
@BarackObama agreed, except NO one should have to pay to get an education. systems flawed, mr. president.
@BarackObama so odisha gov't do not want to work with pratham. Due to commission(money)
@BarackObama with student loans
@BarackObama or nah.
@BarackObama in odisha maximum people are very poor. But odisha gov't person not utilized the money for youth. Only personal use
@BarackObama open classroomS to close prisonS
@BarackObama .its true but some time is challenge
@BarackObama with due respect. sir, I'm very interested
@BarackObama is it tho?
@BarackObama I am doing it President. Great advice
@BarackObama 

After study they wait for job....
@BarackObama 
Higher education in Germany is free, Mr. President. USA should be able to better that.
@BarackObama sir, pratham is a international ngo, who is basically working in odisha state.
@BarackObama Обама ты чмо
@BarackObama Yeah Coz every student and every kid or boy is a future of particular country!!
@BarackObama as long as there are jobs after graduation
@BarackObama education got an inflation as well, and only the rare things worth investing.
@BarackObama ok but what about those that want to go back to school is below poverty line and has school debt and want to get a tech job
@BarackObama student loan relief and repayment programs need to be examined
@BarackObama Please Mr. President The time has come. Please  Reschedule  Marijuana. It is the JUST to do. Please Mr  President
@BarackObama me too only to be a happier person
@BarackObama @UKParliament  UK MPs dont agree. Although they did when THEY were students.... invest in young and reap rewards
@BarackObama eres buen presidente
@BarackObama no doubt
@BarackObama so very true Mr. President & a student loan should be a last choice, not a 1st option in funding  a student's academic journey
@BarackObama I am not sure I agree any longer. I would not discourage any child from picking a trade over a college degree.
@BarackObama right man!!
Her eyalete bir üniversite projeniz hayırlı olsun @BarackObama
@BarackObama http://www.thechoiceisoursmovie.com/watch-film/ 
@BarackObama yes in deed
@BarackObama it's helpful if you have the funds & time. Other than that I don't think it's that great of an "investment"
@BarackObama Higher "education" has changed. Instead of teaching students how to think, they teach what to think. #Indoctrination #$$$Waste
“@BarackObama: "I believe that higher education is one of the best investments anybody can make in their future." Y does it cost so much?
@BarackObama sure, but how can people afford it?
@BarackObama Yes. But first people should know what kind of world they are going to live. So everybody should know about @TheVenusProject
@BarackObama I thought we are doing #AmWorks. What say @KevinSpacey @RachieBros .
#HoC
