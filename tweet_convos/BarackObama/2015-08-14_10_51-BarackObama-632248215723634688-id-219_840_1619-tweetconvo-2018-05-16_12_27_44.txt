@Victoria41768 @BarackObama @MaxEhrenfreund and we ALL have to pay no matter what health care system we have, this helps assure that
@Rick46460 @Victoria41768 @BarackObama @MaxEhrenfreund At a way higher cost, more than double my health care cost
@ffajaz2 @Victoria41768 @BarackObama @MaxEhrenfreund like I said, Congress can work to make it better...they are the ones you complain to
@Rick46460 @Victoria41768  Who said I have a pen and phone dont need congress? Congress has to have more votes or Obama just vetos
@ffajaz2 @Victoria41768 u think Obama will veto something to help his signature law? Sounds like u aremore interested in placing false blame
@Rick46460 @Victoria41768 Is not false blame, he has vetoed everything he does not like, placing blame is Obama thing blame on all things
@ffajaz2 @Victoria41768 Obama has only had 4 vetoes throughout his presidency, again false blame being cast...let me know when u talk facts
@BarackObama A record 65 months of private sector job growth, a 40 year low in new unemployment apps, unemployment at 5.3%
@bosdcla14 @BarackObama Only with Obama stats. Real world stats no where near that unemployment is more like 12%
@ffajaz2 @BarackObama Please ID everyone at BLS you claim is involved in this conspiracy & when you it started.
@bosdcla14 @BarackObama How many people have not given up looking? Stats are only off UI applied or getting UI not all who are not working
@ffajaz2 @BarackObama Like I said, I agree that discouraged workers remain a real issue.
@bosdcla14 @BarackObama That is true but when you have someone who thinks he is a KING you do as he said not what you want to do
@bosdcla14 Needs to try that would be fun needs to be put in his place
@BarackObama
By passing Congress is not a Bad Thing to get things done... Time a Dusting and Cleaning with Congress.
