@BarackObama Here's the first step to a great economy: your impeachment. #ImpeachObama
@RepStevenSmith Actually, first step is you deadbeats in #congress passing serious #infrastructure spending. #topprog
@Jankowski60 Write another check to the Bank of China? That's foolishness, boy.
@RepStevenSmith Obviously, boy, you're aiming for the U.S. to become some sort of weak banana republic. #GOP = #FAIL
@Jankowski60 Yet you're the one electing a Kenyan dictator. #Hypocrisy

@PyrionFlax @BarackObama Very true. Plus research suggests a higher minimum wage will increase productivity in those sectors.
@BarackObama "creating jobs" not the answer. Technology and wealth distribution is the answer. @BillGates
@BarackObama I think we should work on Removing some jobs to make room for people who actually know how to run businesses efficiently.
@BarackObama Corporations must play a role in ojt & hands on trng together w/Gov. To prepare middle class pool for more wealth for them & us
