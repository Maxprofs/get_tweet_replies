@BarackObama 173k jobs at what wage?  and what jobs did they replace?  Actual unemp U-6% is 10.3
@desertkev @BenAksar @BarackObama And what dear heart was it under Bush's crash and Reagan's misery at 10+% U-4? Get over yourself.
@CHURCHLADY320 @BenAksar @BarackObama You need to understand the basics of BLS #. U-3 as Dems report doesn't include any1 4wks + unemployed
@desertkev @BenAksar @BarackObama I do - but inconsistent data bases compared longitudinally is falsification. You need to understand that.
@CHURCHLADY320 @BenAksar @BarackObama All we need to know is that the U3 that Bush left Mr Obama was just a tad higher than 10.3% in 2008
@desertkev @BenAksar @BarackObama Reagan's was, I think I remember, 10.8% So compare evenly, and we're good.
Why am I seeing tweets from @CHURCHLADY320 ? Twitter says she has blocked me. @desertkev @BarackObama

@BarackObama thank you sir. I'm looking for job but still I didn't get a chance
@BarackObama And, a clowncar of Repubs want to get back in a muck everything up again
