@BarackObama people need to know their hard work is paying off for them. Not feel like it is.
@BarackObama ...feel like it?are u kidding?MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES GET THEM SOMEWHERE.and somewhere much better! Feel like! Sheesh.
@BarackObama mine doesn't the harder I work the more I owe
@BarackObama No. Who cares about a feeling. We must be fair to all, and explain in all reason exactly what is fair, to both Labor and Owners
@BarackObama all government workers should be able to live on minimum wage,then give them a little more next yr. Maby they will feel better.
@BarackObama ...that means you too Mr.President.
@BarackObama @ginou1010 ...and it took you 6-and-a-half years to make an attempt at fixing overtime laws?
@BarackObama Except that it's not. Your bosses rig the system to keep us in poverty.

@BarackObama as long as this country takes 30% of our hard earned money, because we need to support those who Won't WORK!
@BarackObama Are you planning on resigning? That would be hope & change!
@BarackObama Keep singing my song. No matter how loudly I belt some don't believe. Even reading about it they don't think it applies to me.
@BarackObama you're not "fixing" OT.  You're moving salaried employees to hourly.
@BarackObama 
Please quit "helping" us...
@BarackObama Shouldn't that read, "We've got to change things so people DO get somewhere and not just "feel" like they are.
@BarackObama The only way we can survive is to work like Horses??
@BarackObama lower the tax rate for OT and holiday pay tax free.

@BarackObama forget overtime cut taxes for middle class. Cut congress jobs. I figured the 1st 2hrs I work a day. Straight 2 the GOVERNMENT!
@BarackObama Deception in words.  "feel like"  and actually getting somewhere can be two very different things.
RT:@BarackObama "We've got to make folks feel like their hard work is getting them somewhere." —President Obama #FixOvertime
@BarackObama Let's make overtime tax free or atleast at a lower rate and reward hard work. #FixOvertime

@BarackObama YAY FOLKS!

@BarackObama timing.
@BarackObama Absolutely!!!
@BarackObama as we have morphine shortage surely can we just pay those afghan farmers 4 those poppies & thus make the Taliban redundant? 
@BarackObama

@BarackObama Then call my boss and get me a raise!!!
@BarackObama shouldn't "feel" like it, it just should!
@BarackObama why would I want to work more than 40 hours to feel like I'm getting somewhere? #stupid
@BarackObama thtat all people want in life is work to make a decent living
@BarackObama Then stop giving their job to the endless flow of illegals.
@BarackObama yes, this is extremely true
@BarackObama preeeeeeeeach 
@BarackObama True Shit
But not actually getting them somewhere. MT @BarackObama "We've got to make folks feel like their hard work is getting them somewhere."
@BarackObama Moving forward for our country.
@BarackObama hope you done
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama So your solution to falling wages is to standardize the 50-hour work week?
