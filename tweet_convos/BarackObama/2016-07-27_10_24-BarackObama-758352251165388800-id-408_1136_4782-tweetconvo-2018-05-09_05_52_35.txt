I wish you could be at the white house till the world ends... you r amazing, wish brazil could have a Barack Obama too
lady your crazy we lost jobs in medical and going from a great job for 25 years to maybe losing our home
have u ever came to brazil? this place is a mess, there's no safe places or even health resources
pres. Helped people cops getting killed race wars and 18 girls lost their jobs in one office
that's really sad. but I think there's not a country that is really safe from all those problematics (and if there is it's...
probably at Europe)
really hope you guys solve all of your problems and our countries get better. 
we have to be careful , I hate that you can't explain it all
@OFA not me im angry

ACA shows how holding an insurance card in USA doesn't ensure access to safe, quality affordable care http://pnhp.org

@OFA I am proud and glad we have Obamacare!!!
@OFA I'm Proud of Obamacare and our  #POTUS  !!!!
except for the penalty fees if you don't get on it or the taxes we have to pay on our tax reports for getting the help
And I lost mine; after being unemployed at age 60, found a part-time job with little over min. wage and was "punished" for it.
Premium We Can Not Afford! A Deductible Can Not Meet!  A Insurance No One Will Accept!The Dr's Raise Cost If Used! #WTF POS

OBAMACARE BIGGEST HEALTH CARE SCAM EVER! YOU ARE A FAILURE, YOUR TERM IS UP AND YOUR OBAMACARE WILL BE RECALLED #RIGGEDSYSTEM
#Ronaldgod
@OFA thanks to obamacare I have to keep changing health care plans and health care providers and pay more every year
and at my expense.  i am surely not proud of that!
Nope. Plenty of others have lost theirs. And people who can't afford insurance are fined. #ThanksBarack #LameSauce
@OFA Obviously you're from the Clinton dimension.
Obama wants it for you. Kennedy wanted it for you. I want it for you
@OFA My son died in November,2013 without health insurance. He could have had it in January, 2014. If only?
@OFA thanks Obamacare I'm paying 3 times what I was paying 2 years ago so people that r too sorry to work can have insurance
The rest of us, are going broke, so enjoy.
You are a disgrace to everything America stands for.
@OFA i m proud of you
Actually, I'm NOT proud, I'm dismayed that there are not more competitive options...
@OFA whyvare you so desparate for feedback?
@OFA I am proud!
Thank you Mr. Obama #pleasestaywithus #weneedyouwithus
