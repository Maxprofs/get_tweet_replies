@BarackObama #Students from Pakistan be given easy access to high quality education in USA. 1% uneducated extremist don't rep 99% Pakistani.
@hmad9rana @BarackObama We shouldn't ease foreign students education.
@armed_geek I condemn your attitude. Y exist Master, PHD or courses on Intl Relations? Education is sharing. UK made billions.

@BarackObama
@hmad9rana @BarackObama You condemn my attitude? I do not care, sir. They should pay their own way as I do. It is not my place to pay ur way
@armed_geek Well I did not get what you are after. Developed countries need helping hands not iron hands. Anyhow enjoy.

@BarackObama

@BarackObama you da real mvp
@AlexisHV_ @BarackObama No he isn't.
@armed_geek @AlexisHV_ @BarackObama I say cut down on government contractors.
@texassweetsnake @AlexisHV_ @BarackObama I say cut back the social & corporate welfare...
@armed_geek @AlexisHV_ @BarackObama most people on welfare do have jobs.  Also many young military families get food stamps, welfare and WIC
@texassweetsnake @AlexisHV_ @BarackObama because they fail at properly managing money.
@armed_geek @AlexisHV_ @BarackObama Is that factual or your personal belief?
@BarackObama @armed_geek without a degree. over and out.

@ellastractia @BarackObama That is awesome! You know he wants everyone on some form of gov't program to live.
@BarackObama  Are there "community college" grads on your staff? As they say in the South: Beating a dead horse don’t make it taste better.

@BarackObama people will have more money instead of spending it by paying for tuition/student loans
@Kay15Judy @BarackObama Amazing how people forget Obama inherited over 90% of this debt from Bush who drove the U.S. into a recession
@Kay15Judy @BarackObama This is the most non-bias article I found. No one's perfect. Have a good day Kay!
@Kay15Judy @BarackObama here's the article, sorry. http://www.factcheck.org/2012/02/dueling-debt-deceptions/ …
@BarackObama awesome
@BarackObama idiot, who will pay this perpetual debt?
@Welsh58 @BarackObama putting college students in debt isn't going to help government debt lmao.
@BarackObama don't propose it make it happen. Its a good step and will be helping lots of family's who can't afford college out
@BarackObama  So where are all the free teachers coming from? They wnt to college so they could work,  now you want to take away their pay?

@BarackObama is for our future, while the genius GOPs of the AZ state leg voted to cut funding at community colleges. #AZBackwardsPolitics
@BarackObama I need help paying back my student loan. I am willing to work. So.. if you can help..please do. Thank you.
@BarackObama at the cost of the tax payers! Shitbag democrats have no problem giving out free shit as long as someone else pays for it!
“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama”swag
@BarackObama and whose going to pay for it? Me? You've taken all I have so you better grow another money tree cause we're tapped out.
@BarackObama nothing is free you take from one and give too another.
@BarackObama That would certainly, give the poor and incentive to stay in SCHOOL.
@BarackObama @YabishRyan @KyanRelzer @Valerio_Buzzi @SavageBartek

@BarackObama Stop stealing from the American people!  You are just buying votes for the Dem Party for 2016.
@BarackObama if you pay property taxes you know education is not free. Please provide an honest assessment.
@BarackObama does this include adults that haven't gotten a degree?
@BarackObama High School is not free College never free it's raising property taxes I PAY!
@BarackObama that's nice now can you kick our prime minister in the ass and have him do the same? Would really like to reach my goals
@BarackObama This will go down the way welfare gies down-inferior product, inferior education.
@BarackObama besides college technical schools should have some support.
@BarackObama Mr. President, it is just a proposal yet? I wish it becomes an adopted policy by states.
@BarackObama this is great for those who can't afford college, but also, what about those who don't have the initiative, Mr. President?
@BarackObama Have my AA in Education & moving forward with my BA in History. I'm 22 & have been advocating this concept for at least 4 yrs

@BarackObama pitches free community college as extension (affordability-wise) of public HS. @BenCastleman #EDLF6080
@BarackObama FORGET COLLEGE, ITS JUST PROGRESSIVE COMMUNIST INDOCTRINATION!! GET A TRADE, ITS GUARANTEED SUCCESS!! COLLEGE IS OVER- RATED!
@BarackObama Exactly who pays for this? The taxpayer?  Then it is NOT free. Just free to those that are already burdening our economy.
@BarackObama Didn't this already fail once because The People didn't support it!
#ListenToUsDamnit
@BarackObama You use the word "free" 2 confuse lemmings & blind #BO supporters, bt nothings free! #PayYourOwnWay #PayForYourOwnKidsEducation
@BarackObama I wish.I didn't follow through w/ College because I didn't want to take on another bill I couldn't pay for later. GOOD PROPOSAL
@BarackObama what part of free don't you get? Your free means someone else pays
@BarackObama HS is paid thru taxes and is not "free". nor would ur college plan be "free".  only the gruberites believe this garbage.
@BarackObama right and who pays for it
@BarackObama I think this is a really good Idea I have honestly been struggling to save up money for college. Thank you Mr. President!
@BarackObama join me in taking a selfie with a book. Think it would be great for your education goals.
@BarackObama Not free. NOT FREE. It's NOT free MONEY!!!

Two free years of college? Why not two years ago? @BarackObama

@BarackObama Congratulations Mr. President!
@BarackObama are the schools going to donate their resources. This is confusing me. Are the teachers going to be paid? How is free possible?
@BarackObama It's not free, someone has to pay and it's the middle class.
@BarackObama FOLLOW ME PLEASE
@BarackObama College is still important to pay for if needed, and maybe cheaper price. Education is just a key to future but so is love
@BarackObama there are pros and con's to this.

@BarackObama yeah?  who pays for this free edumacation?  oh that's right, me.
@BarackObama just like our wonderful "free" health care!
@BarackObama Why don't you focus on making inner city schools better. Since you're the socialist racist dictator Barack Saddam Hussein Osama
@BarackObama  that's a great idea but how about lone forgiveness for people who can't afford to pay back
@BarackObama  Had it bn for all countries , girl's fate would HV ban rosy.
@BarackObama oh yeah I'm going to major in "community organizing" since having a worthless major like that will be free!

“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama”
@BarackObama And who is to pay for this latest wave of imperial generosity, #NObama?
@BarackObama. Makes so much sense!
@BarackObama School now isn't free. Hundreds of $ charged ea. year for public school "admin" or "technology" fees & $ for  non-core classes.
College will never be free. What do not understand about that? @BarackObama
@BarackObama your the Best and keep on keeping ON! God Bless!

@BarackObama @armed_geek also yes we may be able to teach ourselves skills, but you are overlooking the fact that companies will not hire...
@BarackObama @armed_geek man just shut up. god forbid that our tax money go to something for the benefit of our society.
@intherecycling @BarackObama it does not benefit our society. Jobs training would be more benificial. When did shut become how adults talk
@armed_geek @BarackObama A) i am not an adult dude B)  college is literally job training for many many jobs. also on A do not bring up how..
@BarackObama Nothing's free idiot
@BarackObama oh man please let this happen before i go into college
@BarackObama awesome!
@BarackObama you can't spend the few folks paying taxes money fast enough
@BarackObama But high school is not free, and millions quit high school, look at south side of Chicago drop out rate is very high
“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." I wanna go back in time!
@BarackObama so you've struck a deal that instructors work for free?
@BarackObama You forgot to put quotation marks around "free". Nothing is free.

@BarackObama great job Mr potus thanks for coming to Montgomery
@BarackObama I wish you could lead for three terms 
@BarackObama free? What's free? I always find free stuff very costly to me.
@BarackObama As a college advisor in Miami Fl, I know of so many who would take advantage of this...and SOAR!!!
AFTER I STARTED“@BarackObama:"I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is."—President Obama”
@BarackObama I 100% disagree with this...
@BarackObama
@BarackObama please explain who pays for this
@BarackObama forgive our student loans
@BarackObama Quit while UR ahead of yourself.
@BarackObama it's good for the Country.
@BarackObama bravo!da noi purtroppo solo cialtroni!!
@BarackObama It won't be free you moron. Someone will have to pay for it.
“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." What about UNIVERSITIES?
@BarackObama what about all of us who have already paid and have mortgages in student loan debt? Where's the break for those hard workers
@BarackObama it costs us $1,000 for our " free" public education and gov kasich is taking 2 mill from our local sch over 2 yrs
@BarackObama this is the best.!!! I would study but I'm sad I can't study there all the best for you
@BarackObama PLZ! I want 2 years,nd I'm trying 2 save up 4 travel after college. how am I supposed 2 travel when I spent all my $ on college
Although that two years of college will be as useless as a high school diploma is in the years to come. @BarackObama
@BarackObama does this mean my college is free this year.
@BarackObama Fantastic idea, helps poor advance, well-to-do to channel funds elsewhere.
@BarackObama Who is going to pay for it? If you give stuff away, some has to pay for it.
@BarackObama Where students will be taught what used to be taught in high school.
@BarackObama Mr.President what watch is that you are wearing? It is beautiful but am unable to make out the brand and model from the pics.
@BarackObama Who's going to pay for this FREE education?
@BarackObama No thanks. This will drive up tuition and water down education.
@BarackObama and @DCSDFagen would try to find a way to make a profit for her and her cronies #FireFagen #KochWhore
@BarackObama who has will be given more. who does not have even what he has will be taken from him.
@BarackObama I love the idea. My only problem is that I fear college may become as taken for granted as high school is for many students.
“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama” No.
@BarackObama what college degree can I get in 2 yrs that's right none. I'd have stop after 2 yrs cause I still wouldn't be able to afford it
@BarackObama very good idea Barack
@BarackObama How about making ALL college free? We could learn allot from Europe.
@BarackObama As a single mother working 2 jobs making over 100k  in NYC and still struggling I can definitely applaud this move 
“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama” 
@BarackObama "Free"? Who's going to pay for it? Kids are illiterate after high school. Work on grades 1-12.
“@BarackObama: "I've proposed making two years of community college as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama” ugh
@Trevor_Young3 no?
@Trevor_Young3 um ... China model?
@Trevor_Young3 They do not encourage creativity and thinking out-of-the-box. Many graduates lack skills to work in teams or to question.
@Trevor_Young3 affirmative action is on the docket. Balancing with race relations and death penalty makes hard to squeeze it all in.
