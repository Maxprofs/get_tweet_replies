I invite you to show me where my analysis of #BLSdata from @BLS_gov is inaccurate in any way.

Really? How about  The United States government debt 19,500 trillion dollars? Liar.
WRONG: You have caused 78% of the racism in this country.

Them numbers as fake & Crooked as Hillary! You even said it when you ran against her. What happen? She showed you the $$$$$?
Have trouble with facts?
there were no facts here...just frauds and opinions.
"Deficits: " 
The TRUTH is that when Senator @BarackObama & DEMs took majority 1/3/2007,
they inherited FY 2007 deficit = 1.1% of GDP.
The truth is that @BarackObama & DEMs multiplied deficit NINE-FOLD in their first 2 Fiscal Years, to 9.8% of GDP.
NOT TRUE!! LIER JUST LIKE TRUMP!! LIE, LIE, LIE
FY 2007 Hastert/Frist/Bush GOP deficit: 1.1% of GDP
FY 2009 Pelosi/Reid/Obama DEM deficit: 9.8% ofGDP

#thankyou
l'm so  heartbroken you won't be our POTUS anymore.  You've been awesome,  courageous and have the patience of a saint.
I'm sure if you say it enough someone will believe it. But it doesn't pass the smell test with mainstream America.
The way his people cook the numbers I wouldn't believe a thing that comes out of that office
And don't forget your TWENTY TRILLION DOLLAR debt!!!!!!

Figures never lie, but liars always mess with figures!

Funny how the Republicans forget this information. C'mon Hillary yell it from the rafters repeat! It exposes one more lie

the deficit is one HE created! Uninsured rate may B down but it's harder 2 C a dr. And the jobs stat doesn't talk that deficit
and where is our national debt today?
this is a blatant lie.

NO  DOUBT  ABOUT  THAT
Obama, your a liar. We are so far into debt
and then there are the facts you want to hide from.
that's my daddy
if you put those numbers in context with population growth they're not so impressive.
#Awesome job
job well done Mr President
Sadly, it seems necessary to translate this into idiot before it will impact. Speaking fluent idiot is alarmingly empowering
