@nekosensei @BarackObama @Sleestewart I refuse to allow any tyrant you or anyone else tell me what I'm allowed to defend myself with simple.
@OmegaKelevra @BarackObama @Sleestewart >when even the professionals struggle?
@nekosensei @BarackObama @Sleestewart Does it anger you to see Americans free buying Guns when your government won't trust you with one
@OmegaKelevra @nekosensei @BarackObama We don’t want them. Simples. That’s what you need to understand. We’re not obsessed with guns.

@OmegaKelevra The NDAA has yet to have a single case of someone being denied a trial, so bravado. Religious freedom is laughable - being
Compare car accidents while you're at it. @BarackObama @potus. People are flawed. Not the weapons.

@Martytude @BarackObama @POTUS guns don't kill people, people do (people with fucking guns!)
I am not sure what reason media & govt want guns gone, but I'm concerned @richardvickers @BarackObama @POTUS https://twitter.com/richardvickers/status/650001304090222592 …

The media and govt are responsible for hundreds of thousands abroad. With guns @richardvickers @BarackObama @POTUS
@Martytude @BarackObama @POTUS I dunno maybe to stop all the people being murdered #justahunch
@Martytude @BarackObama @POTUS Yeah we have an Army in the UK too, twist is we don't sell guns to loonies in supermarkets
These tragedies are used to further an agenda. That's what I don't like @richardvickers @BarackObama @POTUS
@Martytude @BarackObama @POTUS Yeah we have an Army in the UK too, twist is we don't sell guns to loonies in supermarkets
@BarackObama less then 300 from so called "assault" rifles
@Thegreek72 @BarackObama In comparison to population numbers death by rifle doesn't even register as a percent.
@barackobama  though  this is not terrorism  :p
@BarackObama how about paying teachers well, so the future generations don't grow up dumb and therefore believe everything they see on tv!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama tell us how many babies die from Planned Parenthood that you and Hillary Clinton support and fund ?
@BarackObama I would like to see gun deaths compared to step ladders and not chewing your food.

@BarackObama Between 1980 and 2008, negroes perpetrated 56.9% of all gun homicides. #DoSomething #GunControlForNegroes #DisarmNegroes
@BarackObama 75% of them killed in your almost bankrupt home town under your comrade @RahmEmanuel
@BarackObama
@BarackObama 99.9% of gun violence is done in gun free zones so lets end gun violence but getting rid of gun free zones

@BarackObama Many more babies are killed by Planned Parenthood
@Alxandro @BarackObama And sold. He doesn't care though because PP make a profit from the body parts.
@BarackObama If major gun control cities like Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore were not counted, there would be a lot less.
@liberalscience1 @BarackObama Wrong, the states with the highest per capita deaths from gun violence are Louisiana, Wyoming, Alabama.
@MicheleRedding2 @BarackObama The vast majority were suicides. Being a classic liberal, mental health doesn't matter to you.
@liberalscience1 @BarackObama What's your point? Dead is dead.
@MicheleRedding2 @BarackObama It's a misleading statement b/c he knows many will wrongly believe they were murdered using guns.
@liberalscience1 @BarackObama We were talking about "Gun Violence" and yes, guns in the home make you 3 times more likely to die from a gun.
@MicheleRedding2 @BarackObama My guns never killed me. Should I be scared?
@liberalscience1 @MicheleRedding2 @BarackObama we can but hope.
@BarackObama so you're murdering of babies is OK then.by your support of Planned Parenthood & forcing taxpayers to pay for it!
@BarackObama I will be more than happy to speak of my experience - To help change and pave the way >S< OFA Leader
@BarackObama 
Are you sure this is accurate?
I mean, pretty sure 9/11 wasn't the only deaths involving terrorists.
@BarackObama More people get killed by vehicles I believe, what are you going to do about all the auto deaths.
@BarackObama why don't my kids have armed guards?
@BarackObama if you.know.this,then make more.regulation.on law
@BarackObama 480,000 die from tobacco each year incl 42,000 from second hand. 40,000 due to road accidents, 16,000 due to drunk driving,

@BarackObama IN 2012 more than 1,000,000 people died from abortion in the U.S. Since Roe v. Wade over 58,000,000 abortions. Where's outrage?
@BarackObama just like it did in Chicago right?  Criminals will not enter gun free zones as long as it is posted.
@BarackObama keep up the great work, soon i would love to take place as a president like you.... Feels Great To Follow My Dreams:)
@BarackObama Do school shootings not count as terrorism anymore? This chart makes no damn sense.
@BarackObama Tell your buddy Rahm to enforce existing illegal gun laws in Chicago. Stop and frisk. No plea bargains. 6,000 shot in 3 years.
@BarackObama enforce current laws
@BarackObama Enforce the Constitution!
'The right of the people to bear arms in a well regulated militia'. Not 'the right to bear arms'!!
@BarackObama The Roseburg 9 didn't die from "gun violence." They died because the shooter hated Christians.
@BarackObama START WITH CHICAGO FIRST !
@BarackObama here is a statistic and 'you built that' #EyeOpener
@BarackObama  Only the vaccinated, dna altered, gmo junk food eaters follow you. You wont take away guns. 1776. How many have you killed?
@BarackObama Yet you want to sale them to Islamic terrorists. You're the biggest gun dealer in this country. You're also supporting Jihadist
@BarackObama so does that mean we should band cars? Your statistics are bull. False flag events such as the virginia shooting is an example
@BarackObama you sir have an anti-gun agenda against the american people, car accidents kill more people than gun violence in america
@BarackObama yea, make em illegal!! you know, since it worked so well with drugs...oh yea, it's all part of global enslavement, I forgot.
@BarackObama what abt for those innosent people who killed for their meal in India.

@BarackObama I see manipulation, in order to take away the people's right to bear arms and protect themselves from an oppressive government
@BarackObama Don't even start on gun violence again,  trying to take citizens weapons will not happen. 2nd amendment
@BarackObama how many more die from drunk drivers?

@BarackObama Our collective mental health is in peril. We must address this seriously No one is Immune because we are ALL One! One organism
@BarackObama Our whole Global culture glorifies violence! Why? Look at the most popular video games. It's about killing--not survival.
@BarackObama Yes, we need to restrict ownership, but we also need to understand why we have so many cold-blooded killers amongst us.
@BarackObama 1.7M babies are murdered by u damn #democRATS & @PPact
@BarackObama why don't you star with your city of Chicago, where 50 people where shit over last weekend. You're a disgrace!!! Boy!!!!
@BarackObama The U.S consumerst culture of narcissism has a dirty underbelly of poverty, violence, rage and mad gun laws.
@BarackObama lead by example, end your secret service patrol guns first
@BarackObama And most of it is done by radical Muslims.  Why doesn't this President address that??
Must be kinda awkward... ya damn #hypocrite.

@BarackObama You think the crim's are going to give their guns up? You'll just be taking guns from regular citizens.You won't get mine.
@BarackObama 'This is not a true graph.You can't compare suicides/accidental deaths to terrorism. Gang related deaths ARE terrorism.
