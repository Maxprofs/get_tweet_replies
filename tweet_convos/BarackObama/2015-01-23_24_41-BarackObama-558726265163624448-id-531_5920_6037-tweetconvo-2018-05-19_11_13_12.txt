@BarackObama I think you'll find that the 97% supposedly agree warming is caused by humans. There is no agreement on how to stop it.
@gerrymorrow 1st, .@barackobama is ineducable. 2nd, it's only 97% of the handful of CLIMATE scientists who express a STANCE on the question.
@BradPKeyes @GerryMorrow @BarackObama Why would you say he's ineducable? Them's fightin' words to we 'muricans.
@2casey451 @gerrymorrow @barackobama To us 'muricans you mean, Casey? ;-D
@BradPKeyes @GerryMorrow @BarackObama Correct-ed.
@2casey451 @gerrymorrow @barackobama And that's the difference between you and the Incorrigible Messiah.
@BradPKeyes @GerryMorrow @BarackObama Incorrigible? What?
@2casey451 This isn't gonna be the 2nd time you figure out where my tongue is, is it Casey? :-) (Hint: somewhere in my face) @gerrymorrow
Seriously? @BarackObama MIT Meteorologist Richard Lindzen Calls #ClimateChange a Cult  http://moonbattery.com/?p=54577  #Grubering #ActOnClimate
@sentinel058 @BarackObama It is a cult of every leading climate and atmospheric scientist in the world, except him.
.@JohnCarterCSA Obviously your grasp of mathematics is on a par with Obamas grasp of economics. @BarackObama
...@sentinel058 @BarackObama But go around the country and interview ACTUAL practicing climate scientists, not Heartland and TP lists.
.@JohnCarterCSA That "practicing climate scientists" sounds like an oxymoron. Most are political types seeking grants. @BarackObama
.@JohnCarterCSA If the science is "settled' how come they keep changing the name? #ClimateDisruption @BarackObama
@sentinel058 @BarackObama Why u showing me that Time cover? The author of that piece said he made a mistake, 70s papers said what they said.
.@JohnCarterCSA A mistake? That's what Progressives do all the time - change the name of stuff when it's convenient to do so. @BarackObama
.@barackobama A hilariously trite fatuity from the people who demonstrably DO think science goes away if 97% vote against it. #duh #deniers
.@barackobama You cretins embraced Oreskes in the first place, so suck on it. Live by Consensus Science, die by Consensus Science. #deniers
@BarackObama perhaps they should take a ride on one of the glaciers that is disappearing.
@susansporran @BarackObama I'm not a denier, but some glaciers are actually growing.
@kevntn scientists call it climate change because it is shift in climate patterns, not a warming everywhare. Cooling can happen too.
@EvilParadigm I enjoy the outdoors and hate when people trash it up.I can get behind pollution.Climatologists have over stepped,keep simple.
@kevntn well, I might have belived that if I hadn't spent years observing satellite imagery and ground data that shows a real problem
@EvilParadigm believed what?
@kevntn climate change. The main topic here. I ran out of space.
@EvilParadigm Have a good night, I'm out
@BarackObama @Jodzio Tell them to ask California about its water ! 1 yr left !
@mikelm31 @BarackObama I read they are building the largest desalination plant in the world to convert saltwater to drinking water.
@Jodzio Florida tried not getting much !
@mikelm31 really? I heard they are fairly prevalent in the ME; Saudi Arabia, AE, around Dubai.

@ConsiderThis1 Karen,  I understand how banks manipulate the system.  I did not fare well with this Bank.  I am going through a similar sit.
I hope you come out of this okay. It's very hard on the nerves!!!! @tinapayson
@ConsiderThis1 Thank you. They do not play fair.
That's really the problem! @tinapayson
@BarackObama @Insane_Prophet mike I hope you don't actually believe climate change is real
@ASandborn @BarackObama what the fuck.. If most of the worlds scientists says something is real, I'm pretty sure it's real
@Insane_Prophet @BarackObama oh mike you're miss informed
@ASandborn @BarackObama do you have brain damage? IT LITERALLY SAYS 97% OF SCIENTISTS SAYS ITS REAL
@Insane_Prophet @BarackObama no I just like to question things and find out the real answer for my self  and from all my research it's false
@BarackObama @AL_Progressive What caused the snowiest winter in the history of Boston? Man made global cooling?
@theidealtwit @BarackObama my god, dude, you're really stupid. It's called climate CHANGE for a reason.
@AL_Progressive @theidealtwit @BarackObama I have an older brother who says stupid crap like that guy
@lbragen I had to block him, he replied about 20 times. I just don't have time for that level of stupid in my life. ;)
@AL_Progressive I know what you mean!
@BarackObama their ability to reason and see has been polluted by the PAC's and oil industrial complex. It's criminal negligence
@hsgarf @BarackObama who isn't affected by those entities?
all due respect, in all sincerity @BarackObama, one never needs to qualify any positional stance on supportive% #consensus if #Proof existed
.@BarackObama Your 97% number is BS. You can't get 97% agreement on ANYTHING in this country. #Fraud #ActOnClimate
@BarackObama science?  like the ice caps melting? Oh wait they nasa images show otherwise dumbass fuck off with your carbon taxes

@BarackObama I'm convinced that a candidate that supports women's rights, Equal Pay,.., climate change can do well, good luck.
@BarackObama Support for climate change activists, in short term I need to purchase a new car,.., can promote awareness on our site too
@BarackObama Democrats, any candidate that supported gun control knowing I was being assaulted will lose badly, prediction, Joe, Hilary,..
@BarackObama When I was being attacked, abused, by.. I tried to warn about supporting gun ctrl, I know what they are doing, document it,
@BarackObama The Police and secret police in QC Canada have been involved in inflicting financial and health damages,..
@BarackObama I also think that World Leaders forgot to support climate change activists, while others attack them and try to inflict damages
@BarackObama I think Obama has an opportunity to agree to cut carbon with India, similar to with China, why wait?
@BarackObama  these scientist were bought off  by you no such thing you had better start worrying about God he will destroy the earth
@BarackObama This tweet is like telling your child "Go to school, do what everybody else does & you'll be fine"   You're a clown, Obama.
@BarackObama welcom toindia sir
@BarackObama Very smart, logically thinking Senators..they did NOT blindly, stupidly follow lies and manipulated "findings" ala #Ferguson
@BarackObama TRue!!!
@BarackObama @RayleneRDeck EXACTLY, we had the hottest day since 1884 or something this year.  We didn't learn anything from back then.
@barackobama @photomatt it DOES cause climate change, but it's not the MAIN driver behind it ;)

@BarackObama sounds like 3% don't agree with wealth redistribution schemes to me.
@BarackObama It's about time a #USA president stood up to #Israel for spitting in the face of the #UN @SenJohnMcCain
@BarackObama Neither do #racism & #apartheid! You're on the right track with #Israel and '67 borders! @SenJohnMcCain
@BarackObama -- so why did you let those ignorant senators stonewall you for the last 6 years? remember back when you had a _supermajority_?
@BarackObama what about how you and other abortion advocates ignore the science that condemns abortion?
@BarackObama 97% are fishing for our tax money and your along for the ride aka the next Al Gore.

@BarackObama you should mention that to @TonyAbbottMHR as well...

@BarackObama @Reid_CO They can vote to deny gravity too, it only makes them look silly.
@Brianrrs37 @BarackObama It isn't gravity that holds us to the Earth; that's God's love! #Sarcasm
@BarackObama @Reid_CO Look how long it took big oil to remove led. This isn't about science for them, this is about protecting greed.
@Brianrrs37 @BarackObama Greed, power, market share, & world domination. Who cares if our great-grandkids won't have clean air or water?
@BarackObama @MarkRuffalo Come to think of it so was George W.  Oh wait that happened twice! 
@BarackObama @MarkRuffalo And yet they were voted in by the American people. I guess that speaks to the education system and media influence
@BarackObama because the 97% of scientists done want to loose thier federal grant monies. That's why climate change is an issue.
@BarackObama  pushing climate change for financial or political gain is shamefull Barry soreto
@BarackObama Climate "Scientists" are protecting THEIR interests. It's all about money. Earth covered in ice, Earth got rid of ice.

@BarackObama Perhaps the word should be "Reality" as opposed to say, "Fantasy". (Religion, for example).
@BarackObama @MarkRuffalo Apparently those senators want scientific certainty. Science does probabilities, not certainties. Smh 
@BarackObama @BetteMidler it's not really the senators it's the corporations that own them that have an issue with anything that may cut $$$
