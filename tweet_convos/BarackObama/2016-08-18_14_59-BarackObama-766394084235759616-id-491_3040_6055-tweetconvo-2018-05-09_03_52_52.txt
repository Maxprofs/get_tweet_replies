Very true
@NASAGoddard yess barack you change the worldmake it bether!
@Sulema1220 @capitalweather so why is it just as hot in 1200AD as in 2015? No oil industry in 1200AD
30 inches of avg rainfall... over 365 us one thing... over 3 days is a disaster.
weather conditions were same in 1200AD. I'm asking you to explain why it's human caused.
is MAN-MADE? If man can do something to stop or even slow it, WHY WOULDN'T WE?!!!
because the co2 and warming correlation shows that man does not have that much to do with it
I don't find that to be the response of someone who values empirical evidence. Have a nice day.
I value pumping time and money into something that is inconclusive. You can't prove its not natural
You clearly don't get it. HOW it happened is irrelevant. WHAT you choose to do about it counts.

Don't give taiwan government officials get the remittance, Do as I said . freezing of bank account .Obama.
@tatertotsmom 
Then, please, reject the TPP.
@washingtonpost NEWS FLASH!!! August is always the hottest month.
Virginia & the other states who mine Coal, pull that lever for Donald J. Trump on election day, here's your future w Hillary ??
@capitalweather so what did the marvelous Obama to change human influence over climate. Refusing any kind of agreement
Both NOAA and NASA massage the figures.
@washingtonpost .air polution should be stopped to its last extent by individuals and for that there should some strict laws.
@washingtonpost and how "hottest" means "manmade" ??
maybe because all the hot air coming out of you and Hillarys mouths if your lips are moving lies are being spoke we need Trump
@washingtonpost 

Where? This year has been cooler and more rain in Texas than we've had in the past 20 years? Moron!
The majority of the planet. Leave your bubble. @MichaelBradshaw @BarackObama @washingtonpost
Oh, little ol' redneck me... garsh. 10k years ago the Sahara was green... Did we cause it to dry up?

@BruceMcCurdy @washingtonpost Bullshit, doesn't prove anything.150 yrs of data on a 4 billion yr old planet.
@capitalweather time too go home
It shows the climate is changing...NOT that we are causing it. I know you're not big on facts, but try and keep up with them.
Because Obama has to go, I want comeback to my country of Birth, ant to die there. I need some help for me to do that
@POTUS

That's not true! ONLY GOD IS IN CONTROL OF CLIMATE CHANGE! NOT US HUMAN!

#PraiseJesus #Glory2God

@capitalweather Source, two government funded agencies, NOAA and NASA. Both troubled by reporting methods. Gov. no trust.
You can't even make a working website with $10million. We don't need you to try to fix anything. Stay on the golf course.
