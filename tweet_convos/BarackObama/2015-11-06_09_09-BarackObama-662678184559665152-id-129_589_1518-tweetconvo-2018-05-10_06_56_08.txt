@BarackObama thank you! We need to focus on sustainable energy if we are to pass this planet on to future generations!
@rogerjun2 please provide supporting  data to back up your opinion of wasting $ on green energy?
@rogerjun2 "The ... government program that funded failed solar company Solyndra, ..., is officially in the black."
@rogerjun2 "Citibank believe by 2020  solar will be competing with fossil fuels on an unsubsidized basis in most parts of the world..."
@rogerjun2 , if it hasn’t done so already."
@BarackObama @EMC_Square2 Keystone was designed to ferry crude through US to export markets of OPEC. Never designed for our use

@BarackObama @Synergy3k thank you for ending all oil imports from the Middle East
@BarackObama more dependence on Middle East oil will really help. Moron.
@BarackObama you are deceiving the American people. You twist facts for your twisted theology.
@BarackObama Thank you Mr. President. America needs to focus on clean energy.
@BarackObama what world are you living in?
@BarackObama How can you make this claim? How is adding infrastructure not adding to our national security? Great asset in an emergency.

@THE_DAILY_BLEAT @BarackObama He'd rather continue fucking this country over until he's finally forced to leave in 2016.
@BarackObama wow!!!  Mr President we all disagree with you. By "we all" I mean common sense
