@BarackObama @Quicksilver2723 
Can we read it Sir?
Sounds like the issue is what were opening the door for in the future. I'd like to read
@please_continue  WHEN the negotiations are completed as is true of all treaties, Senate vets/votes upon it, then 60 days of public review.
@Quicksilver2723   Ink, that's too late. It would however be better than nothing.
@please_continue ...knowing full well that when the treaty goes to the Senate, they'll vote FOR it. Their allegations are vacuous.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @andie_walsh Why can't our representatives even talk about it, then? This is commerce, not war...No reason for gag order.
For the same reason - when you have 11 countries negotiating it only takes one demagogue to derail it. @Momisbuff @BarackObama @andie_walsh
