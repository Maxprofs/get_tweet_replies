@BarackObama I think that you are doing a great job keeping us informed on the Ebola info
@BarackObama I think all states should do this screening for their own family's safety & country's safety.

@BarackObama hi bro
@BarackObama :)
@BarackObama say something about #Cuba and #CumbreALBA_TCP about #Ebola
@BarackObama popularity at home is roughly the inverse of Putin's, which is to say, Obama is still more popular than Ebola, but not by much.
@BarackObama better to get a note on how Nigeria turned itself into ebola-free in just few days
@BarackObama ebola for dummies
@barackobama bring awat mincal
@BarackObama Mr Obama. USA is much whorst then Russia. Your politic like AIDS!
@barackobama
@Scrivener3 @BarackObama typical war game scenario, the WG shld address weaknesses 2 then develop strength, guess smbdy missed the 2nd part
“@BarackObama: Watch the Weekly Chris address: President Obama discusses how to get rid of Ebola after watching is vines”
@BarackObama Sure. Every word out of this man's mouth is a lie. If I want to know about Ebola, Obama will be the last person I'll listen to.
@BarackObama THE END OF EBOLA IS PRAYING FOR LORD !Obama great initiative and the fight is with faith,with love,peace and for health!
@BarackObama everything you've said about ebola to date has been dead wrong...only fools will start believing you now....
@BarackObama we need to get back to God and we will prosper as a country and as people .
@BarackObama you are the worst president ever. You and all that follows you are idiot morons .
@BarackObama one thing we do know about Ebola is you said it wouldn't happen here. Thanks odumbass for watching out for our great country.
@BarackObama You mean besides the fact you are deliberately allowing it into our country?
@BarackObama Mr. President, thank you for your response. The nation needs to know the facts about the Ebola virus. The media isn't helping.
@BarackObama Mr President, your's recent Kobane airdrop, is the US's second D-Day landing to save humanity from fascistic-virus
@BarackObama simple enough ,when you can and you should screen ebola at liberian int airports,you are screening it in u.s airports
@BarackObama jwqt
@BarackObama Your words that a West Africa travel ban isn't in the interest of the U.S. proves you have no interest in protecting Americans
@BarackObama Why does FDA clamp down on Plants, Herbs & Essential Oils instead of EBOLA creating culprits? We know who they are.
@BarackObama
“@BarackObama: Watch weekly chris: he discusses what you need to know about his bad singing http://ofa.bo/r1IT ”
@BarackObama Many Americans say u care more about the economy than US citizens; consider where the economy will be when we are all dead.
@BarackObama Sending medical teams there is fine. We do need to stop it there! But allowing flights from Africa to the US is unacceptable!
@BarackObama Ebola disease to this day there is no cure
@BarackObama If you like your healthcare, you can keep your healthcare, not a smidgen of corruption in the IRS, never trust a LIAR, period.
@BarackObama ES MUY DIFICIL IMPEDIR QUE ENTRE  EN U.S.A. EL VIRUS DEL EBOLA MEJOR HACERLE UN EXAMEN FISICO COMPLETO
@BarackObama Why are you NOT calling for a travel ban from West Africa? Many other nations have done so!
@BarackObama turn to d Lord for help, in him dwells solution to all sicknesses and diseases..seek Gods wisdom about all things incld Ebola.
