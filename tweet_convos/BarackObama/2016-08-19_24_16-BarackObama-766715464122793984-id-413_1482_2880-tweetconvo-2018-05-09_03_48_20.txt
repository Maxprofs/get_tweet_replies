When people don't understand global warming principles, like @realDonaldTrump doesn't get it.
yup.. Doesn't understand that summer winter are becoming more extreme.
and tornadoes and hurricanes are more destructive.

It's all a lie, NASA cooked the data to make it look like this for political reasons.
/sounds like a warning to me/Canada & U.S. need to get to work on this problem/
/a world problem/going to take mucho funds to come up with a solution/
Obama u r History and break all Records my bro
Try telling that to the anti-climatic change brigades. The world is warming up at an alarming rate but ignorance prevails.
I am sure that Ms. Hilary Clinton will be elected as the first Woman President of USA in Nov. 2016. Adv. congrats.
Nee 2 seriously do something about the california fire. Lot of damage to environment. Divide the forests by some barron patches
@washingtonpost Better to look at trends than absolutes.

Root of terrorism is Saudi Arabia. Plz remove the root and stop the poisonous tree growing.
Many thanks for your work on climate change, President Obama.
Thanks, Good info. Btw, the Earth is like 5 billion years old, we have been recording weather for a millisecond.

Mr President of the USA. There were normally summer temperatures this year in Poland. It was sunny and It was raining.

@washingtonpost
@washingtonpost hello
Climate Change is just another angle 
For you to steal from the American people. Can't wait until you are out of office.
By your reasoning WW3 should have happened or at least the most terrorism ever in history. Back to using #globalwarming ?
@washingtonpost I remember when we had rolling blackouts through the summers. And what would Al Gore say?
But another record: SUPER HIGH COLLEGE DEBT-both Republicans& Democrats NEVER free college debt slaves!
OK, I admit u democrats may have some valid points https://www.facebook.com/notes/gordon-wayne-watts/global-warming-fact-and-fiction/10153040688525248 … but ANOTHER record is HIGH COLLEGE DEBT...(cont.pt2)
