.@johngio48 @BarackObama lol. If he was in fact a 'tyrantical fck' (SIC) you wouldn't be able to tweet such hatred. Oh, the sweet irony...
@johngio48 Not agreeing with you doesn't make him a tyrant. I might just mean you don't know what you are talking about.  @NickRamWilson
@johngio48 @NickRamWilson He did what he is LEGALLY allowed to because obstructionist repub congress gets nothing done.
