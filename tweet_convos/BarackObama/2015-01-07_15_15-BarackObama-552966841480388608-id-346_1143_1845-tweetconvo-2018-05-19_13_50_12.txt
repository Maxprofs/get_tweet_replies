@BarackObama Thanks to your law forcing people to buy insurance they do not want or need. Well done, Comrade.
@RedGalBlueState @dl34l @BarackObama Who doesn't need health insurance? Who are these special people? You are so stupid, it's scary.
@ChristyKatana I don’t need a product that cost $25,000 per year when my healthcare expenses are a fraction of that. It’s economics, dummy.
@RedGalBlueState 1 hospitalization can wipe you out. That's what insurance is for. Just like auto .
@ChristyKatana Agreed, but Obama wiped out the option of purchasing catastrophic ins for those cases. Forces me to buy comprehensive.
@RedGalBlueState  I have been on a comprehensive plan my whole life through work. It is the most economical way. Think about that
@ChristyKatana If that works for you, go for it. But don’t force me to do it your way. Obamacare does force me.
@RedGalBlueState I don't want inflated medical costs to cover you because you don't have hospitalization. That's what's been going on
@BarackObama LIER your not counting the unreported that u caused to LOOSE insurance and WHO DONT QUALIFY 4 ur TRAILER TRASH HEALTH CARE
Funny; my premium went up by that %. MT @BarackObama Great news: The uninsured rate in the U.S. has dropped to 12.9 percent.
@IMAO_ @BarackObama you're lucky then, because it seems like mine will go up close to 50%, that's if they can fix my 2015 renewal app soon
@gmelika @IMAO_ @BarackObama so are you advising that us Brits should stick with our national health service despite attempts to privatise?
@BarackObama @marstu67 still have medical bankruptcies, though.  http://mn2020hindsight.org/view/accretive-is-not-the-problem-it-is-the-symptom …
@SIRATYST @BarackObama link says it will reduce bankrupties  but MIGHT still have some. No back-up data, just a prediction. Let's wait & see
@marstu67 @BarackObama he should have gone for universal coverage instead of taking care of insurance company executives.  bottom line.
@SIRATYST @BarackObama How would he have passed that?
@marstu67 @BarackObama when he had both houses of Congress for 2 years.
@SIRATYST @BarackObama When Sen. Edward Kennedy died in August '09, he no longer had a filibuster-proof Senate.
@marstu67 @BarackObama i get it.  you're a card-carrying democrat.  where has that got us?  obama didn't even try.  neither did the party.
@BarackObama I'm worried about your trip to India that's coming up. I'm an ahmadiyya Muslim in Qadian India now time I'm also an American

@BarackObama does that percentage equal the unemployment rate?  Obamacare does not cover people with no income, does it? Just honest asking.
@BarackObama You tout a decrease in the uninsured when you make it illegal to be so? It's great to have an iron fist, isn't it?
@BarackObama Yes and #health #care costs have gone up over 100% you fucking #Asshat
Tone deaf and out of step. @BarackObama This accout is the worst PR I've ever seen.
@BarackObama yay for paying a fee for not signing up! That's #freedom for ya!
.@BarackObama But the underinsured rate has spiked 30% due to high deductibles people can’t afford. For profit “health care” is immoral!
