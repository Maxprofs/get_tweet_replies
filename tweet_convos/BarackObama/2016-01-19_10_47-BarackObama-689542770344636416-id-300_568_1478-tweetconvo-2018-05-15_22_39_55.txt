@WhiteHouse #bullshit
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Can you kindly close down the oil fracking which is causing all stocks to tank
@WhiteHouse that equation should be read like this 25,000 pounds equals the amount of uranium shipped out of Iran
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama And just where was it shipped to?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Need #royaltyfreemusic for #webdesign #youtube #blog BUY 3396 music http://bit.ly/1Mn7m9O

@WhiteHouse Given straight to Israel ...the extermination of the Palestinians looms...good job Obama...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 일단 인도 카레랑 한국 김치 같이 드셔보삼 향긋한 식감에 놀라실꺼예요.
그럼 다음에 연락 할께요. 백악관분들 수고 하세요.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 먹어봐여. 진짜 맛있어요. 인도의 공주가 수천년전 지금 한국의 신라라는 나라에 시집와서 불교를 전해준적도 있어요.
인도랑 한국은 몇천년전부터 가까운 나라인데 저도 인도 피가 좀 섞였는지 카레 엄청 좋아해요.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 한국 박근혜 정권들어 이해할수 없는 극과 극의 일들이 아무렇지도 않게 일어나고 의도적으로 정보가 통제되고 있어요.
참 한국 현실이 망조에 망신에 한심한 시간들이 흘러가고 있어요. 형 수고...카레에 김치
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 살해 당한건 이해가 안돼요. 한국 박근혜 대통령 의심 들어요. 박근혜 대통령 아버지 박정희 독재자가 CIA 짓이라 믿고 있는 사람 주변에 많거든요. 여하튼 제 아버지가 CIA였단건 오해인데 왜 살해 당했는지
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ㅠㅠ 제가 여기저기 외국에 글 남긴다고 구걸하는 사람으로 오해 하더라구요. 에휴 참 영어 못하는게 죄지 정신병자 누명 쓴 한국 국가폭력 피해자인데...ㅠㅠ 아무리 생각해도 아버지 CIA로 오해한뒤 한달만에
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 있거든요. 뭐 아버지 사고쳐서 쫄딱 망한적은 있지만...어머니가 벌어서 굶어죽게 되진 않았어요. 어머니가 여유롭진 않아도  굶어 죽진 않으니 돈 벌지 말구 봉사활동 하면서 살라는데 담배값 때문에 힘들어지네요
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 아키에이지 게임 국가 새엄마 조직 때문에 눈징 완료가 어려워 영혼석을 못 모아서 아이템 만들기 어려워 졌어유 ㅠㅠ...
요즘 조용했던건 겜했기 때문이예요. 어머니 헌신덕에 담배만 안피면 굶어죽진 안을만큼 돈
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama where'd they ship it to? Palestine?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how much does that leave them with? 5,000,000 more pounds?
@WhiteHouse Uranium? You should extend your good warm minds across the sea by the internet .
#mindfulness #meditation #healing

@WhiteHouse I thought I read somewhere that it was shipped to Russia...
@WhiteHouse  bomb
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yeah but no one knows where it was shipped to. Probably to terror groups. Great job Barry
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Dilgence, our greatest asset!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Because you say so? Ha! #YouLie
@WhiteHouse where did the 25000 pounds get shipped to?  Hopefully it wasn't North Korea?
@WhiteHouse where to? Hope it's not North Korea
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama hello！
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #iranterroist
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Yeah? Where to? North Korea?!
@WhiteHouse That means they got 50,000 more hidden some where.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You will manage it
@WhiteHouse why do they even have it in the first place?!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama good for you. Thanks
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama BTW, where is it going?
@WhiteHouse where did they ship it to?
@WhiteHouse where did they ship it to? Who now controls it? DOE involved?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama shipped out but where?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama did they send it all, or keep some? That's the question.
@WhiteHouse STOP LYING STOP LYING  STOP LYING  STOP LYING!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Special Delivery to Syria . We are so Screwd!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it is indeed a good development.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama where?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama He's studying nuclear weapons, do you believe it?
@WhiteHouse 
Where was it shipped too?
@WhiteHouse So what I gather from this infographic is that once the nuclear material was put into a cardboard box it was sent to Afghanistan
@WhiteHouse SO .. To whom did they ship it??
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Sorry so many people refuse to listen to John Lennon. "Give peace a chance."
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama destination or for what outcome
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Keep up the great job Obama. Good think we have a President like you. Israel should be thanking you.
@WhiteHouse well factor in density of uranium. 150# to size of gallon milk jug. 167 milk jugs. So a truck with four 55 gal drums.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what is going on.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Great... So what was the baseline? Oh Yah... We don't have one. So is that 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 of total? I no, trust us
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama where is the uranium going?
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Where to?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  tell me again why we are negotiating with these "people"?
@WhiteHouse   Good to hear
@WhiteHouse , and to which trusted friends was this uranium shipped to?
@WhiteHouse What about the other 100,000 they still have?
@WhiteHouse  good lets give em more money
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 
So why does @realDonaldTrump call it the worst deal in American history? And what's his plan then?
@WhiteHouse To where, Cuba?
@WhiteHouse  where was the enriched uranium shipped.   Who is taking responsibility for the storage and security of the uranium shipment
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama UN resolutions have not been as successful in the past because of sanctions put against trade. They are compliant.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama when are you checking what is cooking in #israel?? Are they planning on developing nuclear bombs?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama there has been progress within Iran cooperation with the UN compliance having Iran shut down it's nuclear program
@WhiteHouse @aplsmith5 Why is it called the White House? The lies are certainly not white lies and it smacks of racism too! #stillyes
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
The real issue with Iran is not nuclear but the official advocacy of our destruction for 30+ years.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Even if Iran ships 25k of uranium out they can just as easily ship it back into the country.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama who is the buyer?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
25000 pounds shipped out of Iran?
Maybe uranium ore but not enriched?
Iran will not stop nuclear bomb development
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama actually where it has gone  to which country.
@WhiteHouse The GOP hate this, they wanted war and all gifts 
Israel offered them for Iran's destruction. http://iaminfamous1776.blogspot.com/ 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama where is it going?
@WhiteHouse That's great! Where's did it go? Oh well who cares? Obama Forever! He's the Best Ever! Love that Obama! Keep Changing America!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Receipts?
@WhiteHouse Is it true that it takes as little as 14-90 lbs of uranium for a nuclear weapon?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama to where specifically?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama however we still do not know how much they have left? Because no one's allowed to look I really do don't feel safe
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama good job Mr President
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #ThanksObama

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That is an unnecessary equals sign Barry.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
America and Iran Daash only Hahahahaha
@WhiteHouse To where and why?
@WhiteHouse they shipped it to Russia!!! R U really that naive to think that Russia and Iran don't have back door deals..
@WhiteHouse We need proof this time.Do they have WMDs? Or is there a red under the bed.Anything for the war lobby or economic power.
@WhiteHouse  can we know to which destination?
@WhiteHouse did we the United States take possession of it? That is the real ?
Or is it just being held somewhere only to be reintroduced.
