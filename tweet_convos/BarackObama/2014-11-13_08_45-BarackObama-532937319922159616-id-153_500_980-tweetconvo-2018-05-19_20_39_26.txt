@BarackObama   Now do that immigration Executive Order today if not sooner.  Keep those children with their parents here in America.
@BarackObama um.... As a US citizen, I would not call that ground breaking progress.
@BarackObama in which China gives up nothing. it won't work unless u decimate the US economy, but that's your goal
@BarackObama please support cutting carbon pollution for the sake of not only Americans also other countries as well. 
@BarackObama I care about the environment because taking care is not only vital to life but also vital for future generations
@BarackObama @DrRimmer when will @TonyAbbottMHR follow
@BarackObama I guarantee I will not be putting out carbon emissions by the year 2088
@BarackObama Stop allowing the import of their lead based crap and they won't be pouring carbon into the enviroment.
@BarackObama big deal, we're almost to the point of no return. http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ …
@BarackObama WHY??!!! Why are u working so hard for the citizens of other countries instead of your own??  #noamnesty #legalimmigrationonly
.@BarackObama @EICES_Columbia We reduce. They increase. Nice negotiating. What a big boy, #Obama You tried so hard . Time for your nap. 
Since you, mr president @BarackObama care for #ActOnClimate please consider #SaveTheArctic and stop Shell from drilling there @ClayEngberg
@BarackObama YOU are not 'The United States". There's this little thing called "The Senate" which has to approve those agreeements.
Pathetic deal is more like it. @BarackObama #ClimateGrubering & #ClimateAlarmism http://wp.me/p7y4l-uZX  #ActOnClimate #Fraud
@BarackObama that't great Mr. PRESIDENT.
