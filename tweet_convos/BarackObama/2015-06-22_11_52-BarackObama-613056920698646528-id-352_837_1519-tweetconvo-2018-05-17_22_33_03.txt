Which they wanted so badly we had to force them to get it MT @BarackObama: Repealing #Obamacare would leave 19 million ppl w/o health care
@AaronWorthing @BarackObama You mean just like the MILLIONS who lost their healthcare after YOU FORCED #Obamacare on us??
@Geckogal55 @AaronWorthing @BarackObama so ignorant to here that it's more important for businesses to save money than to provide healthcare
If Obamacare is so awesome, why are they forcing people to buy it? @ShokoFunday @Geckogal55 @BarackObama
@AaronWorthing @Geckogal55 @BarackObama Can You Find ME  Person who has been Forced to buy it?! I never had anyone at my door forcing me ;0
You never heard of the mandate?@ShokoFunday @Geckogal55 @BarackObama
@AaronWorthing @Geckogal55 @BarackObama Well.. Let me just say, I don't think it is legal for anyone to be forced to buy anything.
So you oppose Obamacare? @ShokoFunday @Geckogal55 @BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama the best president 
It's not him. If you want to talk to him, try @POTUS 

@pqpyves @BarackObama
@AaronWorthing @POTUS @BarackObama I know, but thanks 
@BarackObama we know there is only 6 million signed up! You uninsured more than you insured!
@BarackObama dear sir I felt very sad when I heard nine good people were shot and my codolences to you. God save us all.
@BarackObama Congrats! After 30 yrs in Germany: Only the ratnl achievmnt of Jaw-Orthop can giv prev in Med-Dent-Psy Sc´s
@BarackObama terrible to think of the consequences for American families who have preexisting conditions if Obamacare is repealed. Save it!
@BarackObama I feel that would be a shame. Mr Obama you are doing a great job.
@BarackObama follow me
@BarackObama owh ma goshh
@BarackObama another lie their are only 7.5 million enrolled where did 19 million come from thin air!they make this stuff up folks
@BarackObama and put #cancerwarriors like me at risk of losing pre-existing condition protection and lifetime maxes
@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama عفون سيدي الرئيس الرعاية الصحية واجب علينا للامريكان لا نريد ان يعاني احد رجاء
@BarackObama its happy to have peaceful   world and no corruption in globle its basic to have all antiactivity thankyou
@BarackObama seems far short of the original goals.
@BarackObama Like you gave even a tiny shit when millions more lost their coverage and doctor because of this overbearing law.
@BarackObama 
vous ete un exemple pour nous jeune africain a travers vos action  sur #OBAMACARE
@AbdoulayeKonfe la jeunesse doit vite prendre  conscience qu'il faut #développer l #AFRIQUE par le #travail.
@BarackObama @lorac80brat How about taking away Congress lifetime health benefits,since they don't care bout those that need it?
@jamesche85 Yes I agree
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Thankyou so much Mr. President I now carry a better than Medicaid plan at affordable monthly prems !
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama health ins is not health care.key let's pay the hospitals monthly instead of through the gov't, then we won't need health ins.
@BarackObama 
How can we take back those health care benefits? That would be devastating. 
That's your legacy. Thanks for your leadership!
@BarackObama 
Hi my book is to help cancer research.

@BarackObama Insurance is not health care, dumbass.  Everyone in America has always had healthcare
@BarackObama
@BarackObama ACA, people pleasef do not impede progress!  National healthcare anyone?
@BarackObama      Congrats BO , I love having a constitutional lawyer for POTUS :) You are a genius and my hero !
@BarackObama how can that be if only 7.1 million people have signed up so far? the Great pretender lies again( smoking thin man from Kenya)
@BarackObama and that dear sir would be devastating. I support ACA!
@BarackObama bull crap on that....most of the folks on that already had insurance BEFORE you made them join up to your 'make a buck' scandal
@BarackObama You are going to sell us out. Inverted Totalitarianism wins.
@BarackObama Sorry but i hate u
@BarackObama 
Sadly, the republicans want to erase the healthcare reform without listening to what the majority of Americans have to say
@BarackObama  you are the best
@BarackObama  that si true
@BarackObama Amen
@BarackObama that statement us not true. They would be able to get insurance from private companies. And, the number us not 19 million.
@BarackObama um hi yes, could you follow me please, that'd be pretty cool
@BarackObama The less privileged will actually be hurt. Let the politicians allowed this thing to be laid to rest.
@BarackObama That would be cruel  and unusual punishment to deny millions of need people, who has preexisting health conditions to stop this
@BarackObama But will stop the money stealing from the middle class.
@BarackObama
Hey! I'm on #Kik - my username is 'lawa.luqman' http://kik.me/lawa.luqman

@BarackObama
@BarackObama I was born with vacterl association, b/c of the ACA I have health care anyway and it's cheaper than it was. TY Obama. :)
@BarackObama The law is the law we have to follow it why shouldn't you?
@BarackObama See this space
@BarackObama Reduce medecinal expenses adopting disciplined exercises  donating half of the food consumed to U N for distribution to needy.
@BarackObama it may leave people without health care but it's our choice it shouldn't be forced on us!!
@BarackObama 12 million of which got screwed when you passed OC to begin with. You're a liar.
@BarackObama we didn't want it in the first place
@BarackObama  no u can't do this a lot of people counts on Obama care
@BarackObama Defund ACA! Repeal Obamacare. If you want socialized medicine move to Canada.
@BarackObama We need jobs. Manufacturing. This depression was perfect excuse to form programs
@BarackObama  I can not say whati want to I will get into fbi trouble
@BarackObama ohg no, bye bye

@BarackObama Mr president, history will have you down as one of the few great presidents since FDR.
@BarackObama "With all going on that appear to be good, don't take your eyes off the ball."

@BarackObama baaad

@BarackObama

@BarackObama You have worked too hard on this dream, nothing is ever perfect and at all times can be fine tuned and adjusted to improve.
@BarackObama http://www.malekwktaba.com/?p=3056 
@BarackObama becz they paid big tips. Once I ran out of money at McDonald's, the lady behind me helped paying for my burger...

@BarackObama Don't be stupid Americans go ahead & go bankrupt trying to pay medical bills I'm not!Vote for Obama Care!
@BarackObama  I am grateful for the program. Otherwise the "little guy "
would be crushed by big insurance companies.
@BarackObama At least you tried. Best PRESIDENT ever.
@BarackObama  The Republicans are in a tough spot. They need to decide how to get health care paid for when this goes away

@BarackObama  We need market reforms to make ACA truly affordable, like import prescription drugs!
@BarackObama not true. Many of them already had health care and were forced to switch doctors because of obamacare.
@BarackObama Continue the great fight Obama outstanding job!!
@BarackObama  well I am paying for insurance that I don't use at all. So that's just an extra bill for a struggling family #Obamacare
@BarackObama i dont care! i didnt work so i can pay for other peoples hc cuz there too busy getting free money for opening their legs!
@BarackObama that's a much better number than 300 million, america's population.
@BarackObama we must strive to bring human life to a qualitatively better level
