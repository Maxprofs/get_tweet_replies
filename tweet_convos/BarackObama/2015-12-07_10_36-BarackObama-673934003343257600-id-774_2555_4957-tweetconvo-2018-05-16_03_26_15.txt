Apparently the #SanBernardino terrorists weren't too dangerous to board a plane. Some poor logic going on with @BarackObama
Let's not conflate the terror watch list and no-fly list. If they are so dangerous, why have we not indicted them? @usmc_luker @BarackObama
@BarackObama #DoSomething Law needs to change or its illegal to exclude "no fly" list people. Due process, Mr. Prez!
@BarackObama How can a man so full of fear be president of United States?  The no-fly list is an  UnAmerican joke .  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/15/one-woman-s-case-proves-it-s-basically-impossible-to-get-off-the-no-fly-list.html …
@BarackObama Please do not use sale of Guns as source of Income for USA. Stop issuing Guns to all citizens as they are breeding Terrorism
Please check my 2015 tweet Please STOP Sale of all sorts of Ammunition to the General Public and Recall all the Guns sold .
@BarackObama 
Yes,I agree 100%
@BarackObama ou chire  obamita
@BarackObama and?  Which court convicted the person? Where does it say the president,by fiat can make a list and deny constitutional rights?
@bridgje1966 @BarackObama The president said so. The system is collapsing rapidly. Stay tuned.  Glad I am old and won't be around for finale
@BarackObama Excellent point, but do U suppose anyone will listen 2 common sense?I know U do, Mr.President! I dread day when you step down.
...but not too dangerous to arrest. @BarackObama @laurakfillault
@Gunntwitt @BarackObama @laurakfillault Americans are dangerous. That's why they imprison such a large portion of their population.
We will lock some fools up; that's for sure. @mofecuma
@BarackObama @screaminglibral Too injudicious - violates #2A and #5A
@ProgressOutlook @BarackObama Need 2 allow due process on names b/c of possible mistakes. Until then, needs of many outweigh needs of few
@BarackObama Maybe you should serve as an Army grunt and grow a pair.
Again, with the loophole?  @BarackObama @laurakfillault
@BarackObama @DarkMission1 I think we need a study...a white paper in canada...something in the un...then...bingo...no fly no gun...soon...
@RickCanton @BarackObama Too Bad He'll Never See this.
@BarackObama @universe2519 the truth is undeniable and the irrefutable answer is background checks! The majority of Americans believe this!
@BarackObama Hammers are tools used to build, destroy & to kill. Do you want to outlaw hammers? Guns are not the problem. Your naivety is.
@BarackObama become a professional trader  http://goo.gl/rtRMAa 
@BarackObama You're full of BullS***. We don't need Gun Control, we need discretion. If it wasn't for Guns, you wouldn't have protection.
@BarackObama Bring me to the White House and let's have a talk.
@BarackObama Yet there are 2 yr old American kids on the list - lol  Yea - some list
@BarackObama make s great sense
@BarackObama bring me to the White House let's have a talk. Maybe we can enhance your book knowledge to real world & you can share your side
@BarackObama Why are you so afraid? Join the army, pick up a gun & learn how to fight & how to be a real man. Guns are not the problem. U R.
@BarackObama @oldcruiser1 this is why it won't work
@BarackObama I'd think a "Constitutional Law Professor" who took an oath to defend the Constitution would understand inherent problem here.
@BonkPolitics @BarackObama In politics you just say things that sound good. Being legally correct is totally irrelevant.
@BarackObama Don't you see a problem with this, Mr. Constitutional Scholar?
@PornPops69 @BarackObama "Constitutional scholar" in name only. It is just a name of convenience...
@BarackObama so when are you going to indict them?
@BarackObama @commonsharing Yes. Immediately after it closes loophole of your criminal treasonous #IdentityFraud that lets you board #AF1 -
@BarackObama , so uh.. There they are... At the airport. So... 
@AaronDriver5 @Juanita_Estrada @BarackObama She looks very happy to be here!
@jtf18james @Juanita_Estrada @BarackObama stoked, I'm sure 
@BarackObama But this would require common sense, Mr. President. That is something this Congress does not possess.
@StevenSlivka Are you intentionally ignorant or do you truly believe the crap @BarackObama feeds you?? EDUCATE YOURSELF.
@KristineAz 
Say it David
@BarackObama work on that out dated vetting process, or maybe try and get the people to do their job correctly
@BarackObama Whose "you"? It should read 'If a person'.
@Nathiest @BarackObama You mean who's you?
@iibystander Auto correct. ;)
@BarackObama Ain't gonna happen, you tool. @bayareahausfrau Ain't gonna happen, you tool.
@N_Fatale MEEEEE??????@BarackObama
@bayareahausfrau If you have to ask that.... @BarackObama
@N_Fatale Whew! @BarackObama
LOL @bayareahausfrau @BarackObama
@BarackObama what I said about obama a few years ago.
@BarackObama @commonsharing and why not try to create a society which doesn't create ppl who are so angry they kill. Less war more education
@BarackObama @warnerjennifer Flying is not a constitutional right.  Having gun is.  Gov is taking away right without trial.  Not good.
@BarackObama unfortunately we can trust your administration to get it right. You are surrounded by idiots
@BarackObama I'm raising money for  Family in need. Click to Donate:  http://tw.gofund.me/p92wyyx4  vía @gofundme
@BarackObama You have NO idea of the American way of life - OURS is a Judeo-Christian society. Islam should be banned - it's a THEOCRACY!
@BarackObama U.R. right sir
@BarackObama the Republicans are the new white Isis
@BarackObama you can do something about Americas safety, but won't.
@BarackObama we know you hold #anthropologist close to your heart. You want #congress to #dosomething? Send in #anthropologist. #realchange
@BarackObama Did you know that #TribesOnTheHill was the only ethnographic research of #congress done by #anthropology. Send them back in.
@BarackObama Congress is full of antiquated rituals that allows it to remain nonfunctional. Send in the #ritualbreakers #anthropologist
@BarackObama instead of pleading for change, #RefreshCongress. We know you like #anthropologist! Put them in #congress to #endthefuckery
@BarackObama uses fed power (i.e. The IRS) to stifle opposition. Best tool yet: "You can't fly and hand over your guns!"
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I agree with you Mr Obama.
@BarackObama 什么跟什么啊
@BarackObama CRIMINALS DO NOT GO TO GUN STORES. BAN GUNS AND YOU CREATE A BLACK MARKET.

@BarackObama La NRA est le" principal ennemi mortel "des américains.Limiter son influence dans la politique est nécessaire.
@BarackObama @bros4bernie what's the barrier to entry to get on the no fly list...pissing  off the TSA.  Low barrier of entry on that list.
@BarackObama CONGRESS IS PAID TO MAINTAIN STATUS DUO.
@BarackObama Can you say due process? Are you sure you lectured on constitutional law?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama that much is true Mr President #thetimeisnow
@BarackObama  I concur with you!
@BarackObama what about the people that are on that list that shouldn't be? #DoSomething about that first.
@BarackObama If you're too dangerous to board a plane, you're too dangerous to be in this country. #ImpeachObama
@BarackObama yes they do
@BarackObama #DoSomething. Look at that man in the mirror. #DueProcess. Stop police crimes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XE_tZr8eqcw …
@BarackObama Congress CAN violate rights of citizens without due process and enable fascist government control... but why should they?
@BarackObama Your NOT supposed to be in the USA...Fix that and Remove the no fly list! Case closed.
They could, @BarackObama, but why would they?  #2A
@BarackObama Congress seems 2 be the Body of Loopholes. Seem 2 master the construction porous legislation, i.e. tax law, no fly, guns, etc.
@BarackObama ALEMLERİN RABBİ ALLAH C_C Lİ VE KURANI KERİM ŞAHİDİM OLSUN Kİ PEYGAMBER HZ..MEHDİ DİR..

@BarackObama Remember back in 2004 when Ted Kennedy was on the no-fly list?You should think this through more thoroughly. #DoSomething
@BarackObama that is so true.
@BarackObama Hey numbnuts like the guy who purchased the weapons for the dangerous people?  You're a piece for sure
@BarackObama @SexiestPatriot sounds like he will be firing the 72 DHS employees on no fly list
@BarackObama get them out of DHS. yeah,you do SOMTHING
@BarackObama How about deporting the people too dangerous to board a plane?
@BarackObama ....just so you can get your grubby hands on controlling people's CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS !!!!!
@BarackObama President Obama yes please take guns away from people and support ISAS JIHAD AT THE WHITE HOUSE
@BarackObama DON'T WORRY I'M SURE A CATCHY HASTAGGY-SLOGAN WILL SOLVE EVERYTHING :) #RepeatedlySteppinOnARake
@BarackObama just because your on the "no fly list" doesn't mean your evil. One has nothing to do with the other.
@BarackObama Too Dangerous to Be President of the Free World ! Get Out!

@BarackObama this is dangerous.. Should be other stipulations like u.s.citizen, know terrorist ties, etc. Now it's arbitrary , can't get ofg

@BarackObama :)
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Makes sense to me. There's too much 'crazy' all over the world!
@BarackObama Neighbor didn't drop dime on suspicious activities because you liberals created accusatory fear climate in this country.
@BarackObama What Congress should do is impeach and try you.
@BarackObama haha
@BarackObama 
日本は、ネトウヨが勉強不足で理不尽な奴らだらけで、華麗なる一族が支配するだけで、上層部は同じ人間達しか動いていない事が納得できません。日本の財閥は、自民党系の大久保部落民が支配して経営陣がけしからん奴らばかりですが、エンジニアなどの職人は多分一流です。
@BarackObama Remember you swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Please sir uphold your oath
@BarackObama Soon, like schools, Stores, Gas stations Etc will be fenced/barred up, pass metal detector/security check to get in. WAKE UP!
@BarackObama Most people by percentage ARE too dangerous to have a gun. Criminals local and abroad don't care about our laws, use stolen gun
@BarackObama aide les musulman des etat unis d amerique

@BarackObama @SexiestPatriot Ban planes bcuz they'reNOT in Constitution? Ok, but won't ithurt our economy evenmorethan ur Muslimbros on9/11?
Need of the hour. If a person is banned from flying, how can he have gun? @narendramodi @WFRising Let's support @BarackObama in this deed.
@BarackObama Muslim terrorists got the guns. 72 of your own DHS cabinet are ON THE NO FLY LIST!
@BarackObama Constitutional rights are not "loopholes."
@BarackObama @SexiestPatriot If they're too dangerous to board a plane, you might want to close our open borders first! They might walk in!
@BarackObama so just forget innocent until proven guilty, due process & 2nd amendment?  How democratic of you
Anyone surprised that @BarackObama doesn't know the difference between the do not fly and suspected terrorist list?  #GrossIncompotence
@BarackObama @SexiestPatriot If you're too dangerous to get on plane you shouldn't be collecting Federal paycheck. Fire the No Fly Feds.
@BarackObama @SexiestPatriot Mr President if they are to dangerous to fly, why are they waking around free in public?
@BarackObama provide stats showing no fly list comitted gun crimes. You can't you lying mf sob
@BarackObama resign already
@BarackObama So you Barack Obama would have denied Sen. Ted Kennedy the right to buy & own a gun. 6 year old is on the list @SexiestPatriot
@BarackObama Why don't you do something? I among many Americans are tired of your non strategy policies you have in place. Do something!

@BarackObama So much needs to be done, #DoSomething!  Please!!!
@BarackObama But...are we sure everyone on that list SHOULD be on it (Ted Kennedy etc.)
@BarackObama it's a good cause the fact that you want to make weapons stay out of reach of dangerous people.
@BarackObama If a terrorist is planning an attack, do you really think they care where they get their guns from, bought legal or illegally
. @BarackObama If they are too dangerous to board a plane, they are probably too dangerous to be walking around freely, right??? MORON.
@BarackObama If you don't want to be commander-in-chief please do America a favor & resign. The BS has run dry Mr. President. #DoSomething
@BarackObama #FIXTHELIST
@BarackObama please retire now president.
@BarackObama nice spin
@BarackObama How many on that list work for your DHS? What possible reason could there be?  Maybe the list has a problem or two?
@BarackObama If you're too dangerous to board a plane,you're too dangerous to be in the USA!Congress needs to stop YOU from letting them in!
@BarackObama Coward. Do your freakin' job and protect this country. We pay hundreds of billions each year for you to do that.
@BarackObama So you mean the same no fly list that @nytimes in June 2014 said was unconstitutional?
@BarackObama I support your stance on gun control
.@BarackObama @brownbrumby #DoSomething for the Truth.
@BarackObama By do something I assume they IMPEACH you?
@BarackObama At a time when our country needs a leader, how dare you politicize something like this! HOW DARE YOU!
@BarackObama true gentleman keep Elliott poems nt insecure mind of
@BarackObama No, due process is guaranteed by the Constitution. If you want to take rights, prove charges in court. #Rightsarenotloopholes
@BarackObama People on the no-fly list have not been convicted of doing anything wrong. Due process still matters!
@BarackObama Agreed!!
@BarackObama You may have missed it in the news but these two perps were not on the terrorist watch list!
@BarackObama Where is the right to appeal if you're put on the no-fly list?
No shit! @BarackObama
@BarackObama Due process is so overrated!
@BarackObama could you maybe stay for four more years?
@BarackObama Go Trump Go, Hoo Waa  A real leader ,who says what America is thinking, Jesus is my Lord an Savor,, not Obama
@BarackObama ... these plans won't stop violence though. That's the problem.
@BarackObama That inclueds U.
@BarackObama 1 loophole at a time. Thank you
@BarackObama you know there is a constitutional due process way to ban guns for known terrorists.  You are not defending the constitution
@BarackObama how does that stop criminals and terrorists?????  How genius???
@BarackObama  exactly
@BarackObama agreed. They could impeach you. Talk about a do nothing congress.
@BarackObama  Merry Christmas 
“@BarackObama: Congress can #DoSomething about this. ”
@BarackObama presidente en Venezuela el racismo es demasiado grande
@BarackObama and we lock our front doors, not because we hate those outside, because we love the ones inside!
.@BarackObama Using secret suspect list that denies a priv to deny a right is slippery slope that risks #BillOfRghts  #DueProcessSomething
@BarackObama For the gazillionth time... You're lying, you KNOW you're lying, so STOP.
"Due Process", thank you very much!
#ResignNow
@BarackObama  Nice candle, bruh. Apparently a silly hashtag needs a shitty picture as a prefix now.
@BarackObama I say if you are crazy you can't buy a gun. Sorry Mr Pres you can't buy a gun! and I hope the next Pres declares you #insane.
@BarackObama The unConstitutional No-Fly-List? A violation of the 6th Amend right to face your accusers, evidence, and see the law/rules.
@BarackObama how is it that 30 members of #HomelandSecurity are on the #noflylist? Hmmm? They can't buy a gun but terrorists can? #insanity
@BarackObama STFU
Arbitrary or #DueProcess ??

“@BarackObama: Congress can #DoSomething about this. ”
@BarackObama @John_16_2 Put due process into the way the list is compiled and maybe you'd have something. As it stands that's anti-liberty
@BarackObama It was Rubio who put his 2 cents in and got change for non-cents.
@BarackObama : uur wife is most likely a man chuss her arms look like the fucking hulk .
@BarackObama; The Liar-in-Chief, yes Congress can do something about this. Impeachment should take care of it.
@BarackObama And who determines who's too dangerous to board a plane? Where's the due process?
@gagood @BarackObama We threw that out with national security, limited government, accountability, transparency, and Crystal Pepsi
@BarackObama It violates two Constitutional Amendments, Mr. Law Professor.  Please, just disappear.
@BarackObama Mr. President, due process should not be granted to those who commit treason to the USA. Once treasonous you forfeit all rights
@BarackObama 
Señor presidente
@BarackObama Ur right We the People r all about gun control! We use Both Hands! Stay away from Law biding Citizens to protect from Radicals!
