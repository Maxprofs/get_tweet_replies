Expand on what I assume is the start of a point.
What are we going to do about this debt? Highest it's ever been. I'm glad he's optimistic though
the debt was high when he came into office,so maybe that ? Should b asked of Congress,theycontrolcash
@WIRE: Please, don't blame the wars like the retarded people do nor congress. Potus is the reason.

: For your information the Bushes are illuminati and are part of the problem. U don't get it.
Why is he leaving the country worse off than 8 years ago in every measurable way?

Great article from a great President.

The idea that technology will save us, is an extremely dangerous opinion, not based on reality.
.@ohetweet technology is a non-violent & non-colonial approach to better life: Less hunger, clean H2O, better shelter, bridging distances.
Technology is also false illusions, such as fracking, clean coal, methane as a "bridge fuel", and carbon capture storage.
as a buzzword, maybe. But the truth of technology seeks to solve a problem, right?
Sometimes technology seeks to solve a problem. Other times it seeks to increase corporate profits at the expense of our Earth.
Well, How many American soldiers did Bush kill!
