@BarackObama minimum wages $15 per hour !!
@deepaksir @BarackObama Sounds good, but prices of everything will go up. Like $10 gallon of gas and $12 gallon of milk.
@Dougfarmer1970 @deepaksir @BarackObama You mean if every human was paid equally for the work they do, prices would go up? That's nonsense
@nicky0472 @Dougfarmer1970 @deepaksir I think they should be paid a livable wage. You know, not living in poverty while working full time.
@nicky0472 @Dougfarmer1970 @deepaksir Where in places of mostly MW jobs are the high school-only single parents, any parents, working?
@BarackObama We're not a heard of sheep, but each individually different.
@BarackObama herd*
@BarackObama Let's start by slashing you to part time pay.
@BarackObama You already have equal pay. Stop lying to people. Gender inequality is a myth.
