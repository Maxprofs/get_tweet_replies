@BarackObama. Wats all diz Obama's so much Quest 2 empower Women 4 goodness sake?
@BarackObama rather than raising our voices to be heard, teach Directors how to manage Co-actively, so they can listen well to the needs.
@BarackObama It's not about raised voices or demand; we must have a Co-active Conversation debating why integrity in business is the key.
@BarackObama great thought

@BarackObama No we don't. We just have to obey the 1963 Equal Pay Act. Start at the @WhiteHouse, where women get paid less than men.
@BarackObama did you know that there is already a law that protects women's pay? It's called the Equal Pay Act. It just needs to be enforced
