The Parks belong to all of us; until YOU have a temper tantrum over a spending bill, then YOU arbitrarily close them.
Govt. should pay more attention to the native peoples abandoned to the worst of the lands; i.e. Lakota in SD
@BarackObama @POTUS and the only one we must care for, so they can equally care for us as well.
We can't let the Bundys of America steal our public parks! #keepourpubliclandspublic !

#Yosemite No to naming rights and Big Biz in our parks!!!
A lot of us can't afford to drive  across town, and they are vacationing on tax payers backs.
@BarackObama @POTUS Only the RICH can afford to get into the US PARKS!
Which is why we should protect our natural resources ---
If the parks belong to all of us why do most of us have the pay $$ to get into the parks??
Wow the hand of God at work

Congratulations on writing a great gov tweet! http://shiningsea.measuredvoice.com/whitehouse/status/744236623295057920 … (Ranked 42nd for Jun 18.)
you didn't save this park. It was saved by those before you. Stop trying to take credit for something someone else did.
Beautiful!
makes me sick how you talk about saving the world. But tear the U.S apart bit by bit.
then why are you filling it up with my Muslims?

@BarackObama @POTUS That´s true.
@BarackObama @POTUS so we can close them on a whim to those who own them.

@BarackObama @POTUS PlzRealize:$£GREED is DAMAGING Earth which is driving ClimateChange,which is damaging business & ppl's lives
@BarackObama @POTUS psalm 24:1 The earth is the LORD’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein,
My only addendum...WE belong to these parks and planet...We're just passing through and must preserve this as best we can
@BarackObama @POTUS WE NEED the WILDWORLD & every time CORPORATES & GOV'Ts RISK it for money,you risk Earth/Climate & ALL of us.
@hjbassett4281
@BarackObama @POTUS WE cannot SURVIVE w/o the WildWorld,every eco-system,habitat & creature has its place & purpose in the whole

We'll soon bomb Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, then eventually Iran.  I feel you.
BLAH , BLAH , BLAH ! THE DAMN CHINESE , IRAN , INDIA , MEXICO RUSSIA CARE LESS !YOU PUNISH YOUR OWN COUNTRYMEN ! IDIOTS !

@BarackObama @POTUS Ok...
wow they are nice
thank you reminding us. This is truly a beautiful planet and I would like to keep it that way.
@BarackObama @POTUS Wait, what?  Obama is in Yosemite today?? Why didn't anyone tell me?
: Like that socialist T. Roosevelt said::“Our people do not understand even yet the rich heritage that is theirs.”
@BarackObama @POTUS Thanks, Captain Obvious! Why is everything you do an attack on Trump? You know what Jesus said.
Sorry that "These parks belong to all of us" is "socialist" to some.
Just remember god created the earth and everything on it not the government.
The lands  belongs to our Creator, we are stewards. As legal Americans & visitors we should preserve these great lands.
@BarackObama @POTUS 
Then force the big polluters to stop destroying our only one earth, Mr. President!
don't worry hellory will sell it to China
@BarackObama @POTUS that is beautiful
she say hello ...does know me from any other perfect stranger... I'm like get away...
can u believe I'm here at local library in N.H. a small town called West Lebanon &a little girl goes by on a bicycle...
@BarackObama @POTUS love
I would think he would be working on how to keep Americans safe instead of visiting a National Park. Not his job. I 4got.
@FLOTUS great day! #FindYourPark love to see you @YosemiteAwahnee 6? thank you!!
and POTUS is out to lunch without a sandwich when it comes to real American issues of concern.
Yes, it is a beautiful life enhancing life sustaining finite resource that is currently being undermined by moneyed interests
