@BarackObama @GovInslee #ActOnClimate yes is the time!!!
@animaleuropeRMP If CO2 traps heat, by def'n, slows RATE of COOLING. Prove that. No more emotions or correlations. About a rate not temps.
@donbeeman i don t use cooling in my home and really a little in my office. I hate cooling if not at 40 celsius
@animaleuropeRMP Good for you :)
@donbeeman yes cooling is really unhealthy and polluting i m against it and too high heat too

@BESCoop @BarackObama @GovInslee Do you have confidence that a global #Community will engage for mutual benefit & #climatechange response?
@EcoESP @BarackObama @GovInslee At a local level Yes; Unlikely at a national level; On a global scale no leadership consensus before crisis!

@BarackObama @GovInslee  and why is there humans dying from dehydration yet u have the rich like  yourself washing your new BMWs with water
@BarackObama @GovInslee  why's there humans with ten rooms or more. When some don't even have a room.
@BarackObama @GovInslee True we have to correct the mistakes of previous & present generations will be gift as blessings to next generation
@BarackObama @GovInslee released from the burning of just one tree.
@BarackObama @GovInslee Please lead us to the right direction. You are the leader and only one who can stop the use of plants biofuel.
@BarackObama @GovInslee I know you are so busy and I don't want to bother you but this is urgent matter.
@BarackObama @GovInslee  even if trees are replanted immediately, it takes many decades for a tree to grow and absorb all the carbon
@BarackObama @GovInslee forests are carbon sinks, and diminishing them is the same as increasing carbon emissions.
@BarackObama @GovInslee Our ecological system cannot be the same without biomass pool in forests.
@BarackObama @GovInslee That's how ecological system works. All biomass must be used by the system. Otherwise, the system will collapse..
@BarackObama @GovInslee bugs eat and decompose fallen branches of trees, animals eat those bugs and then feces provide nutrients in soil.
@BarackObama @GovInslee "Shot civilians under Donetsk. This is your true democracy, Obama?"    /
@BarackObama @GovInslee There is no sustainable biofuel made of plants or woods. And there is no 'useless' bare branches in forest.
@BarackObama @GovInslee So true. That's why you must ban the use of woody biofuel. Climate is changing because of deforestation.
@BarackObama @GovInslee
@BarackObama @GovInslee warming on the West Coast over the last century was not caused by human activity more so by a change in the winds.
@obamaidiot @BarackObama @GovInslee And to what do you attribute the directional change of 'the wind's'?  #p2 #UniteBlue #climatechange
@NeilStandish @BarackObama @GovInslee I'd say it's probably years of liberal hot air aka bull shit
