we pay for lies to be disseminated.
@BarackObama So now we've got insurance we can't afford instead of not being able to afford insurance. :(
@jeffkatzshow @BarackObama just think about when you're in an accident and you need an operation you can't afford.
@ghayner7 @BarackObama Right, folks still cannot afford the increased deductible. Do you understand how this works? Looks like no.
@jeffkatzshow @BarackObama you're saving money in the long run
@ghayner7 @BarackObama Actually you're not. You might want to educate yourself on the two guiding principles of insurance. The Law of Large
@ghayner7 @BarackObama Numbers and the Law of Adverse Selection.

@BarackObama I'm not a Supreme Court justice but, "You lie"! And since when were you ever worried about adding to America's debt?
@BarackObama why won't the right tell the truth about Obama Care?? Facts are facts!!
@BarackObama who will be the next President for US?
@BarackObama #Obamacare now when will the vets get taken care of?
@BarackObama we love y'all
@BarackObama my husbands workplace stopped carrying health insurance, now we have to purchase it, & pay 100% of it. No credits here ughhh
@BarackObama jump
@BarackObama  This is just numbers  but if you cannot afford it and do not get it , you will be fined and there is a deductible too !
@BarackObama that's a lie. You had to coerce us into cooperating. You've pulled more than that out of the economy with this bullshit.
@BarackObama what about replacing it with a single payer for all
@BarackObama I liked your statement..if like your insurance you can keep it....well premiums went up four times the original cost. Thanks
@BarackObama You must owe fed inc tax to get Ocare tax credit subsidy. If u don't owe taxes, you get Medicaid. 2/3 Ocare = Medicaid not ins
@BarackObama keep it up Mr President...
@BarackObama your a special kind of stupid ain't ya?? Lol
@BarackObama thanks for nothing!!
@BarackObama lol and also the most expensive. REPEAL OBAMA CARE @realDonaldTrump  will take care of that and clean up your mess.

@BarackObama http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/wal-mart-shutter-269-stores-154-us-36310758 â€¦
@BarackObama It does to Republicans. They are why we don't have nice things.
@BarackObama Based on what evidence? Are you making up "facts" again?
@BarackObama Of course, you are forcing people to be insured even if they can't afford it. You are proud of that?? #ObamaCare
@BarackObama  why u worry about taking our money u need to fix our country and don't banned our guns
@BarackObama will we have a chance to hear the alternatives that have been brought to the table by other reps? I'm not opposed to ACA, jw
@BarackObama thank you mr. President for your vision for the middle class. Obamacare is a life saver.
@BarackObama i disagree! @GOP  plan to replace obamacare its better! (Lol)
@BarackObama Tuesday alarm and vote
@BarackObama that's good,  but so many still hurt....
@BarackObama But health insurance premiums have skyrocketed due to Obamacare, and ppl can't keep their MDs or plans
@BarackObama thank you!
@BarackObama It's called the affordable care act, not Obamacare you pretentious dimwit!
@BarackObama if sense was common or nation would be doing even better so what makes sense to the sensible is nonsense to the senseless POTUS
@BarackObama - it does if replaced with single payer universal healthcare insurance.
@BarackObama  $250/mo for useless ins that has a min deductible of $5K for 1, might as well pay the penalty. All part of your Master Plan?!
@BarackObama your peoples here crossed the line neighbors brutalitys gov devices feds health care preference liers here crossed the line
@BarackObama When I lost my job My Doctor suggested I get Obamacare! Because lab would cost too much out of pocket Best advice I ever got!
@BarackObama - I wonder how many would enroll if it weren't for the FINES? Also- individual health ins used to be cheaper for middle class
