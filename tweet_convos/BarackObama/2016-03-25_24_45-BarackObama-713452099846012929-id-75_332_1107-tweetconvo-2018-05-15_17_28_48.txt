@OFA @BarackObama @VP   Mr Biden should run four prez
@OFA @BarackObama @VP Try nominating a judge who respects the constitution.  You will get a hearing.  Merrick=joke
@OFA @VP Is there no end to @POTUS  ability to cry when not getting his way? He's a lame-duck and should give up now. What a Failure!
@ElectionWoes @OFA @VP @POTUS there hasn't been an election he's not a lame duck.
@Eric_the_bench @OFA @VP @POTUS He is a lame duck because he has no House or Senate support. That makes him irrelevant.
@ElectionWoes @OFA @VP @POTUS don't believe me ask Websters dictionary instead of making up definitions
@Eric_the_bench @OFA @VP @POTUS you're funny holding out hope that Obama will be able to do anything from this point forward. He's done.
@ElectionWoes @OFA @VP @POTUS smh partisan fighting has nothing to do with "lame duck". You show a distain for facts and replace w/ opinion
@Eric_the_bench @OFA @VP @POTUS lol. I understand the definition, but I also know without support he is just that a lame duck.
@ElectionWoes @OFA @VP @POTUS so u understand and then u dont. Smh. Support has nothing to do with it.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP Any case worthy of SCOTUS can wait, or BO could just recommend a Constitutionalist Judge the Senate would approve of.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP HE is the one who said no nominations in election year!! You people are the WORST hypocrites. Disgusting!

@OFA @BarackObama @VP As was his prerogative. The current chairman has the same prerogative to do otherwise when he deems it appropriate.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP  wrong Joey. There IS a Biden Rule.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP Biden's rule actually does exist. The judge Biden/Kennedy blocked was more than a year before Bush's term.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP How about we charge Obama with treason, and out his ass in GITMO. Then senile old Joe can be POTUS for a few months.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP Watch the videos, he blocked Alito for weeks before allowing a vote. It hasn't been 1 week and liberals are crying.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP And John Kerry was for the &87 billion before he was against it.
@OFA @BarackObama @VP The President  has done his presidential  duty  it is now time for Congress to  do their own  and grant Nominee vote.
@OFA @VP @BarackObama that's not the good point you think it is unless its accepting blame for the always flawed elitist makeup of the court
@OFA @VP Only b/c you, Shummer, Biden, etc. failed to stop the process.
