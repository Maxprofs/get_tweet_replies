@BarackObama then get rid of any groups that have any racists goals like kkk or blacklivesmatter #AllLivesMatter
@Potus @BarackObama why a black president never did recognize Yuri Kochiyama´s fight for #CivilRights, no less brave than of Rosa Parks?
@POTUS @BarackObama Rosa Parks deserves a statement directly by you: http://1.usa.gov/1QdCI5I . Not Yuri Kochiyama:  http://1.usa.gov/1RCMcH1 .
@POTUS @BarackObama maybe @IamSandraOh reading can explain to you who was #YuriKochiyama. @mrdannyglover witnessing:
To @POTUS @BarackObama on Yuri Kochiyama #YuriKochiyama and Rosa Parks and #CivilRights: http://bit.ly/1m96wUq .
Nothing personal with @KiranAhujaAAPI but Yuri Kochiyama deserved to be recognized by @POTUS @BarackObama himself:

@BarackObama. Presidente parabéns, não quer presidir o Brasil no lugar da Dilma.
@BarackObama miri oucan
@BarackObama Sure! Her effort may have been deemed small, but after decades, the effect has been far-reaching...
@BarackObama Claudette Colvin refused to give up her seat on a bus. Her arrest preceded Rosa Parks' by nine months. Lest we forget.
@BarackObama Dear President please help me against discrimination from US Embassy Doha-Qatar.
@BarackObama today we are all soldiers that have forgotten the reasons we fought! Wasted hungry minds waiting to be fed but nothing to eat!
@BarackObama hi sir
@BarackObama what do you know about heroism
@BarackObama Sad how fear squashes ambition and holds us back. I feel our society has lost the courage to make America better.
@BarackObama I Rembert all the great presidents who didn't forever that they were Caucasian
@BarackObama  We have always been equal. God ordained that. Evidently you don't know or care.
@BarackObama  how about you tweet a celebration of all the brace men and women who defend what Rosa Parks fought for?
@BarackObama we did have justice and equality until you came into office. You're the one who created this race war. Your agenda is division
@BarackObama how about Presidential Medal of Freedom for President Jimmy Carter. A true humanitarian.
@BarackObama justice for whom?
@BarackObama nice of you Prez. Obama you'll be missed as well
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama SALAM UN ALAIKUM. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, I DON`T AGREE WITH YOU. IT`S ALLAH WHO GIVE RESPECT WHATEVER YOU ARE. ALLAH HAFIZ.
@BarackObama Another nonsense:Make the USA Better? When Obama, Bush, etc enjoy war money& abandon americans in severe forms of poverty-dummy
@BarackObama Obama is not bold to remove the hereditary handcuffs created by Pres. A. Lincoln et als.White Slaves enjoyed abolitionist law
@BarackObama Nonsense talking like Pres. Kennedy: Say what you can do for the USA & not what USA will do for you, when hands are on handcuff
@BarackObama let the justice equality spreads to all third worlds countries

@BarackObama we live in hope that the day will come when certain humans will equally consider the feelings of others and not just their own.
@BarackObama Map of Metro Light Rail from Long Beach to Los Angeles includes Rosa Parks Station..Kids are Alright
