@BarackObama @SteveThomasNow 
Globalization isn't a bad thing.What's bad is that it's Capitalism that seems to benefit the most
Not citizens
@veggie64_leslie @BarackObama I completely agree!  Both parties have good ideas.  But corruption unlimited in the @GOP isn't one of them.
@SteveThomasNow @BarackObama @GOP 
So far with globalization,it's just been the rich getting richer & more powerful.
And citizens suffering
@veggie64_leslie @BarackObama @GOP Globalization benefits those who need help the most- the extreme poor.  It is fair that we pay more.
@SteveThomasNow @BarackObama @GOP 
I don't mind paying my fair share, but when 1% takes 75 cents of it off the top, I'm pissed.
@veggie64_leslie @BarackObama @GOP I'm fuming bad too when the rich try to steal food from the poor to lock it up for no purpose but greed.
@SteveThomasNow @BarackObama @GOP 
You don't globalize that greed, you stop it before you spread that disease globally
@veggie64_leslie @BarackObama @GOP Yes. Greed needs to end. Greed of the 1%. And greed of all of us relative to the people living on $1/day.
@BarackObama except China?

#BarackObama
Thank you very much for protection in me. 

#Obama was real peace and was real Reader.
@BarackObama One step at a time simply. It's now or never for a new beginning, for a new world! ... Your turn
@BarackObama Being president of most powerful country in the world yet liberal and bold.
@BarackObama you need to be held accountable for treason and war crimes.
@BarackObama  you will do.. !
@BarackObama Why do I get the feeling you're heavily invested in Vietnamese textile manufacturing? "We're gonna be rich, Michelle!"
@BarackObama Then why are you cloaking it in secrecy? Where's you commitment to transparency?
@BarackObama I'm not so sure about that...
@BarackObama If it's so good, why did you negotiate it in total secrecy?Oh wait, that was because you didn't want people protesting ur crap
@BarackObama Obama freedom for biafra Obama
@BarackObama Oh wait, you forgot to mention the slavery clause.
@BarackObama when exactly did you sell your soul? im not even gonna mention your morals/ethics, where is your spine dude? just sad really..
@BarackObama um...  what about the #FREEDOM2FORMUNIONS4ALL
@BarackObama Is #TTP about a transpacific trade partnership or Third-Party Payer?
@BarackObama My bad joke. You don't have to pay me.
.@BarackObama you are a disgrace to free trade & freedom it's self. Free people don't need gov determining how they trade amongst themselves
.@BarackObama regulating people's health care, internet, financial deposits, student loans, energy consumption etc isn't free trade bro.
@BarackObama #TPP hurts #familyfarmers, rural communities andenvironment.  #TPP means more #factoryfarms.  Don't let this be your legacy.
@BarackObama Do I smell burning cotton? #LiarLiarVampire #TPP #TPPANoWay #StopTPP #AnybodyButClinton
@BarackObama Just what are we supposed to make of a deal that has been kept secret from the American people? #TPP
@BarackObama #TPP Has raised the prices of drugs   Doctors Without Borders Slams TPP Deal For Artificially Increasing Drug Prices #NEWS
@BarackObama what about dirty shrimp and human slaves in Malaysia? Just the cost of doing work for the people I guess?
@BarackObama tell us only 5 bad things about this partnership @BarackObama!! or it is perfect?
@BarackObama Prove it leads to less slave labor.  If it is so great less us read it.
@BarackObama What about all the people who will die waiting for meds because of the gifts you've given to big pharma???
@BarackObama so a trade agreement largely crafted by industry, and we are still unable to read the text? #TPP #scam #youarefeelingmyass
@BarackObama great
@BarackObama Hello!
My name is Việt. I come from Vietnam. My brain being controlled by satellite.Please give me freedom.
@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama hmm yeah
@BarackObama TPP allows us to better communicate and trade
@BarackObama bravo
@BarackObama you are really cool!:)
@BarackObama The TPP is great, now when are we going to fix our awful trade agreements with China?
@BarackObama Hello Sir, Its my  desire to meet you.
@BarackObama Very good action to help have nots.
@BarackObama that's a ridiculously low standard. But it's good to know it hurts the public less than the existing trade deals. #WhatChange ?
@BarackObama ..keep on..congratulations..
@BarackObama when they passed the free trade agreement on my planet there was a giant sucking sound as all the jobs went to Pluto
@BarackObama Americans don't want #TPP WHY are u push in' it?And WHY do you keep #TPP from American review yet let co's n other nations see
@BarackObama Help the Retired Teamsters!!!! Save our PENSIONS please!!!!! 50% cut you will have 410,000 homes going into foreclosure!!!!
@BarackObama Please don't ignore this! Teamster pensions to be cut by 50%! Save our pensions! KOPPA! Unfair and unnecessary!
.@BarackObama #TPP labor rules may be good on paper but it's all about enforcement & we've failed miserably @ that in past trade agreements.
@BarackObama show us the content of the tpp and let us decide in the name of transparency!!!
@BarackObama We need #jobs in the USA! Not better profits for Big Businesses We need #TPP for #working people. @AFLCIO
@BarackObama Great, thank you Mr. President
@BarackObama Thank you for every effort, plan, and initiative to enforce justice for everyone!  You are truly appreciated!
@BarackObama and in return we will give them our jobs?
@BarackObama schooled by 13 yr old with more common sense than @TheDemocrats #IStandWithCJPearson #IStandWithAhmed
@BarackObama But will it create more jobs than it ships over seas? No use having cheap goods if you don't have buying power
@BarackObama пожалуй единственное мощное достижение Обамы за все время
@BarackObama you go Mr President.. God bless u and family always..
@BarackObama TPP will only enrich the 1%, the rest of us will eat cake!
@BarackObama @ifarmlight
@BarackObama You will be the only one to follow, we know is a ploy to get unions on board with you.
@BarackObama The problem with the #TTP is that corporations can circumvent the legal process of sovereign nations via a tribunal. #badidea
@BarackObama Good job Mr.President keep up the good work sir.cpl Scott
@BarackObama stop the violence please. Stop the painful attacks please. There are other ways, let's explore them.

@BarackObama @jessicadesaixo
@BarackObama It's the only way he's going to create more jobs !! The demand for U.S. technology is at an all time high !!
@BarackObama If this is true, it would be a leg up for the Us.
@BarackObama Bullshit. It gives all of our labor laws over to private corporate arbitration.
@BarackObama We all lose it a debasement regulatory, food safety and Pharmaceutical Chemistry! exclusive benefit to the lobby!
@BarackObama You mean The Phantom Pain?
@BarackObama wow veri nice man sr. Obama

@BarackObama the other "free trade" agreements tanked the middle class. The TPP will not be an improvement.
@BarackObama Getting things done
@BarackObama It also unreasonably extends copyright terms,gives foreign businesses power to sue governments&will destroy the free internet
@BarackObama legalize weed bro

@BarackObama or not but okay
@BarackObama very goog..I'm ready..mr.president..best regard..
@BarackObama Bonjour Président @POTUS Très bonne nouvelle.
@BarackObama R you trying to convince us or yourself? It doesn't do anything for American workers except eliminate their jobs & lower wages.
@BarackObama alida
@BarackObama Will they have OSHA? EPA? USDA? Even if they do pay this any mind it's a far cry. American workers suffer again to big Gov.
@BarackObama if trans PAC is good for America then why did u put in the bill job retraining for job loses? Making hamburgers is not a job.
@BarackObama Super! bravo Barack!
@barackobama ki kbr
@BarackObama Why does everyone hate the #TPP then? I think it's because it cements a global hegemony for corporations! More trickle down #BS
@BarackObama C'mon Mr. Presdient, you can do better than that.
@BarackObama YOUR A BIG LAUGH..YOU HADNT ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING,BUT A BAD RECORD BEFORE GOD..WITHOUT REPENTANCE,YOUR HELLBOUND
@BarackObama Translation for the everyday person:  The cost of everything is about to GO WAY UP!
@BarackObama great ..#respect..
@BarackObama the TPP will go down as the biggest mistake of your presidency. I thought you would #change corporate influence in politics.
@BarackObama Bullshit on TPP. If it was such a good deal....wheres the transparency?
@BarackObama peccato che il tuo mandato non potrebbe durare ancora tanto. ..speriamo che chi arriva dopo faccia la stessa strada
@BarackObama So China will continue to hide slave labor in prisons, like we do, and flood our markets with artisan killing trash? Release it
@BarackObama why does virtually every labor union oppose it then?
@BarackObama Hey, if you really want to inform us about it, release the damn thing for everyone to read already. No more secrecy, comprende?
@BarackObama Hola.
@BarackObama Let us see the agreement.
@BarackObama good way to sugar coat it.

@BarackObama And why make big pharma patents stronger to increase their profits on back of sick?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Release the damn text and let me decide that for myself.
@BarackObama It is understandable to get around WTO, but why give corporations powers over nations? The power to sue Govns for loss?
@BarackObama Because when a government is sued it is the people who pay and #inequality rises even more.
@BarackObama not surprised average Americans don't understand trade agreements, #FDR
@BarackObama that all seems a farce when Nepal's trade partner #India #blockades #Nepal. US say something!
@BarackObama you're wrong#feeltheburn
@BarackObama Happy America
@BarackObama Excellent thinking. Thank you so much.
@BarackObama Too bad we don't have any informations about it... just a tiny amount... i would like to have more please, same for TIPP.Please
@BarackObama It also screws over every country that isn't America. They're people too.
@BarackObama If we can't read the deal how do we know these highlight are real and in what context are they interpreted...
@BarackObama Why is it being kept a secret then? Please make it public.
@BarackObama If it was a good thing Senator @BernieSanders would not oppose it so. He is the ultimate in voice of reason and goodness today.
@BarackObama Wow that sounds exactly like what they said about NAFTA before we lost 1 million jobs.
@BarackObama Finally we see some positive actions done  All we ever hear is bad news #change #what #we #see #politics #takethoseticsout
@BarackObama add #terriffs to trade and go from there . Do not do another crappy trade deal we need strengthen ones got now #nafta on crack
