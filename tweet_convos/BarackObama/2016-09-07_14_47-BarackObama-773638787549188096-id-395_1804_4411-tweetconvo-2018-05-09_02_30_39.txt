@nytimes thank you, mr president Barack Obama!
I'm so angry w/ you. I voted for you, and this is the sh*t you pull. Your legacy will be remembered. Not in the way you think.
There's no #GlobalWarming that's something you #DEMS made up! It's just rained a whole lot this year! #Denial
one of my biggest gripes with the GOP -  ignoring unanimous support from scientists that global warming exists.
amen! You know, I'm over political polarization. Just do what's right, accept when you're wrong and move the fu** on!
@nytimes coastline flooding has been going on for millions of years.

Mr. President, if you care so much about the climate, why did you approve more drilling than any other president in history?
Would you PLEASE stop trying to spread ManBearPig awareness?  We get it! You find him scary! Enough already! Go back to sleep!
building in low lying areas prone to flooding, #dumbasarock just as smart as those who build near faults or below sea level
You need focus on the Louisiana flooding! People have problems too many homeless!
if only republicans got a clue and helped out. I guess they won't unless it's written in scripture from thousands of years ago.
may Allah help
.@BarackObama but the seas were supposed to start receding the day you first rode into the White House on your Magic Unicorn. What happened?

@nytimes as long as it doesnt effect your golf game!
maybe you should address the largest gathering of native Americans in over 100 year?
Look at historical weather conditions.
Will wait for a better idea in 2017 after your Muslim ideas have left USA
@nytimes total ignoran've of scientific fact
build 1,000 nuclear plants
------it is so dangerous...make strict laws on international level to stop global warming ...Let us save our planet.
1 more thing, get rid of nuclear power plants all together &help teach people to conserve power&water not waste. #lawsofnature
@nytimes also maybe a better recycling program that actually pushes to recycle everything. let's close the loop. #actnowclimate

my greatest desire is to have a handshake with President Obama #WillitBePossible
OBAMA YOU NEED TO WORK WITH YOUR PEOPLE TO COME UP WITH A WATER PIPELINE TO MOVE ALL THIS WATER, START NOW DEVELOPING IT!
WHAT R WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT? U constantly talk/tweet about climate change, but never about a #plan! Whatcha got?!
Political conflicts as consquenses of shortage and scarity of http://water.Today  nly 700 mil. population with out water.
NO AL INDULTO DE TERRORISTAS EN @BluRadioCo @BarackObama
what about genetically modified food labels- in 07 you said that was your priority- what happened- it is 16 and no labels??
@nytimes Global warming is at hand.
@nytimes it's really alarming. ..
Start digging and building mountains now.
- Tom Pollo's father a man of 83 years was amputated by Nigerian soldiers in a bit to get his son and the old man died yesterday
. Better now than ever. This could have been taken seriously a long time ago. Middle England seems to be susceptible also
Climate change is a reality, we need to have résilient measures Mr. Président
@nytimes freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. remitted back to the United States, to be fast
no one with sense believes this global warning shit. Counting down your days..
@nytimes
it's too late. We have crossed the non-returning point. #iwanttobewrong
@edstierli We agree. One major step would be protecting Standing Rock water & heritage. Step up to #NoDAPL .
Trees are needed now to preserve mans reality and reverse the effects of #climatechange Not CO2 as some say to do
@philipaohlund whack http://job.you  are such a crazy man .
@nytimes #ActOfClimate
@nytimes #Sir, good mrng from India. How to go about protecting life & Property along the coastal zones? Is there a way out..!!
@nytimes But BO! Please tell me! Like you know how Earth was created & can stop Satan!
@nytimes decreased use of conventional sources we should move forward using renewable sources.

i like the sea,she is my friend,mankind is not,sorry and good luck.
@nytimes what about #NoDAPL
it's about carbon tax you globalist fraud
it's all about global control
谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦！
Ya right!
@nytimes oh dear. I visited miami. FL. and boca in 2004. Lovely place and people. Save the coast. Good luck.  I pray for u.
not good
@nytimes sucks for everyone else except for @MichaelPhelps
We'd have additional 35 billion / yr to protect our coasts. It's the pin money, nothing militarily, Obama gives other nations.
@nytimes thanks for letting the Rothschilds own us all... for those who don't know Clinton email #1606 #MonstersAmongUs
kenapa yah ekspresi Obama mengingatkan Ku pada pak joko widoo
Please #HelpAngola
@nytimes @SgyYogarajah ON BEHALF HUMANITY, YOURS HAVE TO BE THANKED FOR THE ENDEAVORS TAKEN BY YOUR GREATNESS TO REDUCE--CRISIS
simply start another war on global warming and nuke that extra water away the American way.
@Portsanta @nytimes now?? Arent u guys a lil late? LMAO
I guess still better late then never. But u made it sound like u just woke up after a 100 year sleep. Lol
callate, títere sin huevos @BarackObama

@nytimes We are used to it. BTW THE OTHER LOCATION IS THE BEST FOR THE REFUGEE CENTER. THE OTHER LOCATION COULD BE DONE SMALLER
on a Smaller Scale. I think The First Location is The Best for Job Employment so fourth. Smaller one for The Disabled!
YEah, flooding happens when you have a hurricane. Nothing new there.
@nytimes I'm with you... but you've got a couple of Luddite naysayers here too.
the time to act on alot of things is now, namely the rift in this country u made. Climate change is low on the list thanks to u
Continued severe weather events prove your efforts are ineffectual & as futile as your attempts to force a Garland hearing.
how about you stop pocketing money from the diary & meat business & realize the ONLY way 2 stop #climatechange is 2 be #vegan 
If you can show one instance of an averted weather event attributable to you "climate change" initiatives we will listen
What is "theoretical" is that humans have the capacity to stop it. These weather events persist despite your efforts.
@nytimes The water is speaking #Waterislife#NoDakotaAccess#RezpectOurWater
@nytimes And keep building in flood plains and river bottoms. #GEOLOGISTS/ARMY CORP OF ENGINEERS?
And you show a pic of a high tidal surge from a coastal storm causing the flooding not normal sea level rise.
now I say to u sir its time to tell us Americans if mermaids are truly real. We deserve the truth. It's not aliens sir
president Obama sir I heard from a very reliable source you actually got to meet real life mermaids n became impressed
actually, a long time ago.   But are you saying you want us to do something?  You are the leader.  Lead.
we need an executive order on climate change
@nytimes save the planet GROW HEMP!!!!!! WAKE UP OBAMA!!!! 
Free Leonard Peltier
@nytimes the time to #ActOnClimate is gone, now is time to #FaceTheConsequences.
Where? I don't see it here on the west coast.
