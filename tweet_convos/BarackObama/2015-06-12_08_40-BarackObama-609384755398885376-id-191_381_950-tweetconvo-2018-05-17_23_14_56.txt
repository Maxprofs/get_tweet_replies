@BarackObama you are not to be trused
@BarackObama 
Thank u Mr. President for your inspiring words at Rev. Pinckney funeral!
@BarackObama if you stop sending jobs overseas with bills like TPP then we don't need TAA.
@LaborSCFL @BarackObama we need jobs in the usa !
@BarackObama ok
@BarackObama If it's such a wonderful thing for workers why did you wait over 6 yrs to try and get it passed?
@BarackObama Will contact my local Representative and Senator. They can make the right decision based on these facts: http://ofa.bo/f7xg 
@BarackObama Thank
@BarackObama ...more smoke & mirrors for your illegal immigration movement.  as a civil servant, enforce our laws...
@BarackObama TAA is not the issue. IF this deal will create more jobs, why do you need to help displaced workers? The ISSUE is the DEAL.
@BarackObama be real

@BarackObama if congress votes no on expanding TAA its against the benefit of the country
@BarackObama

@BarackObama allowing corp. reps. In tpp but U.S. Workers out smacks of dick cheney's "energy" meetings.  When did B.O. join oligarchs?
@BarackObama Anytime a deal is kept secret from the public, it is generally a bad deal. Be transparent and then we can have an open debate.
@BarackObama and we should believe you why?
@BarackObama go lie 2 some1 else. U broke my trust wi forced health care that none of us can afford. so now we R without, & penalized. LIAR
@BarackObama the  American public needs you to explain why it's good  Mr. President
@BarackObama  No on both sir, all you are doing with all due respect is ending are nation as we know it. you are sending jobs overseas.
@BarackObama -TAA - isn't this notice that there will be jobs lost if we sign off on TPP-FastTrack?

@BarackObama I'm sorry Mr President. I can't support you on this one.
@BarackObama If, as you say, #TPP is different from NAFTA & won't hurt US jobs why the need for a bill to retrain workers?
@BarackObama I think "ObamaCare" should be certainly abolished since it seeks to kill baby-children by Christian Charity Orgs. Wrong to me!.
@BarackObama

@barackobama

Everything you say is a lie...not believing this one either.  Glad congress denied you today! 
@BarackObama
@BarackObama..Good deal! 77% of the public found jobs. Good for AMERICA!
@BarackObama what's at stake if they vote yes is more jobs going overseas, an even higher trade deficit, & more US dollars in foreign hands
@BarackObama big thing is the TPP will make the TAA assistance necessary. Trade deals are bad for U.S. workers. Tread lightly Mr. Prez b
@BarackObama  Oh, they plan to take over civilization completely and is being directed by powerful economical interest  which know no one!

@BarackObama $200m down the drain. It doesn't work. Go away already!
@BarackObama Mr. President, a little transparency regarding the TPP would have avoided this.
@barackobama and about ,,stakes"- is just amazing food...and if U one time taste ,,very good stake" being later vege is just impossible...
Any amount of market manipulation won't counterbalance the pro-capitalist and anti-worker TPP
Kill TAA to end fast track @BarackObama
@BarackObama I am a army vet and I want to know why so many of use are losing our homes to foreclosure, the system is broken Help

@BarackObama @Isla_78 This "Trade" deal sounds more like Job Training and less like Trade.
@idrawrobots @BarackObama @Isla_78 Yeah, job training for serfs and MORE crap service jobs!
@barackobama hello sir
@BarackObama  can you tell me your number
@BarackObama This is a Fing joke!  The TPP will displace more workers than you will be able to retrain.
@BarackObama Mr. President from your past "deals", I wouldn't trust you dealing cards.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama these numbers just show how many jobs have been offshored. What jobs are going to be left if tpp passes? #NoTPP
