@BarackObama maybe you should protect your military as well... @centcom looks hacked by IS.
@BarackObama forgot its #FreeCyberSecurity
@BarackObama How can you be believed that you take any of our security seriously after your Paris NO Show? Your a terrorist sympathizer.
@BarackObama (cont.) because on one hand privacy is necessary, and on the other, there should be a level of self and external awareness.
@BarackObama then people should be parents and monitor their children's activities. Trust them fine but kids will be kids duh.
@BarackObama how about the head of cybersecurity getting locked up on January 5th for WHAT????????
@BarackObama We all do.  Net Neutrality is not the answer.
@barackobama caring abt cybersecurity, had u care abt child rights in palestine things would have been different bt nothing is permanant
@BarackObama privacy should never be encrypted however validated on a basis of infringement. it's a distinguished contradiction (cont.)
@BarackObama Really? THIS is your priority? Have you been watching the news lately? #smdh
