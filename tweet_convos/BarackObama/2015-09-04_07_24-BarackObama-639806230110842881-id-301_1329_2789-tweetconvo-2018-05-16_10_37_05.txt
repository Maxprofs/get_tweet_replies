@BarackObama Hey.
@BarackObama Fed policy is not secrecy.it needs to be more open& be declared in advance for an year.If usa implements this,all  follow u.
@BarackObama and yet more people than ever are on food stamps, which we have to borrow from China to pay for, racking up trillions in debt
@BarackObama great average of jobs for America

@BarackObama That's incouraging my president
@BarackObama I  like you my boy
@BarackObama good
@BarackObama a specific date adds to transparency & avoid vested interest of officials in stock markets.daily a statement is unhealthy.
@BarackObama its not because Obama. Its because Fed. Thanks to QE ;)
@BarackObama If the sacrifice produces growth of a people want to be part of it, in Argentina sacrifice it equals frustration...
@BarackObama why unrest be added to world markets from fed members.they can state in advance by this date,interest will be up come what may

@BarackObama still doesn't match the # of jobs lost or those who have given up on  job market. Drop in the bucket. #StopobamasSpinDoctoring
@BarackObama if it's  not broke don't fix it. Economy seems to be doing well. Housing market is a big reason. Lots of fixer uppers. Don't ^%
@BarackObama it's good jobs are added but that isn't enough if the jobs are not quality jobs. We want quality as much as quantity.
