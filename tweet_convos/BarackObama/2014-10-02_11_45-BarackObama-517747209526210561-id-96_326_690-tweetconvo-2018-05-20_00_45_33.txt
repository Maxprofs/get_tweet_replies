@BarackObama Lies. My company's Health Care premiums increased by 55% due to your stupid BS!
@BarackObama Do you really believe that, Mr. President?  You people in DC are so out of touch with reality in the world of the middle class.

“@BarackObama: "We're slowing the cost of health care—and we're covering more people at the same time." —President Obama #AmericaLeads”
@BarackObama @ErnieFreeman that is mot true on my part. Out over $1800 this year on copays&less coverage   Only $250 last yr
@BarackObama bullshit, we were paying $200/month which increased to $450/month because of your health care, people who work pay for lazy ASS
@BarackObama that is crap and a bunch of lies
@BarackObama what about 11 millions of humans been  here working  hard, paying taxes, that you don't care?
@BarackObama shut.the.fuck.up. asshole
@BarackObama I have affordable healthcare! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
@BarackObama ok
@BarackObama That's the best policy,ever!
@BarackObama slowing the cost? For who?
@BarackObama You are not controlling cost, you are controlling payments.  Someone is losing money, It can't last
@BarackObama No, you've caused family premiums to spike $3,000 per year.
@BarackObama who tweets for the president?
@BarackObama who "we're" and what does "slowing the cost" mean? And now for my next trick....
@BarackObama Huh. Mine just went up. Maybe your thinking of another successful country.
@BarackObama Thank you for funding law enforcement to combat Medicare fraud, including mental health fraud in nursing homes/elderly.
@BarackObama "The rate of lies is at its highest under this administration than under any previous presidency!!" <- if BO was honest 4 once.

@BarackObama No way Obama! Fox News told me ACA was going to ruin the healthcare and our economy. So you must be lying! #ConservativeLogic
@BarackObama I don't know Barack, it seems the cost for cancer health care is skyrocketing!! : (
@BarackObama and the same time you're killing children in other countries!
@BarackObama bella Presidente, solo voi americani avete la botte piena e la moglie ubriaca...
@BarackObama just habitually looks u in the face and LIES through his friggn teeth! Sick of it,cringe when I hear his moronic voice uh uh uh
@BarackObama good thing you're slowing the cost of healthcare, considering all the #Ebola
@BarackObama When will we bring #climatechange & #globalwarming back to the forefront?
@BarackObama totally delusional! Costs are rapidly RISING..your Affordable Care Act is NOT affordable, you don't care & its all an act. FAIL
@BarackObama America Leads isn't very accurate, considering you can still go bancrupt from medical bills, other countries = free health care
@BarackObama You didn't slow the cost of healthcare for my family. It spiked to about double. Thanks a lot.
@Southern_PUNdit @BarackObama Ebolacare...the compassion of the IRS and efficiency of the VA.
@BarackObama Thank You Sir!
Tell that to #wi residents who found out last week their insurance premiums increasing 13.8% next year @BarackObama
