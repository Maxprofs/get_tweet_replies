wow at $7.75 per hr and part time GREAT JOB
And the GOP repeatedly blocked raising the minimum wage & creating other jobs ..GOP--> petty politics b4 USA
@ apparently u don't pay attention to raising min wage in states like CA and WA. Businesses closed or laid off
EXACTLY RICK IS BLIND MORE COMPANIES & JOBS ARE GONE IF THE DEM'S RAISE IT #VOTETRUMP #NEVERCLINTON
you guys are full of shit, & facts dont matter. In your mind, more needless poverty is good for US...twisted
and the prices of EVERYTHING will go up. That would lower the value of the dollar. Cut Corp tax loosen regs =JOBS
you have have settled for bogus info from conservatives trying to make failed trickle-down econ even stronger
OBAMAS BROTHER SUPPORTS TRUMP!!! THAT SAYS IT ALL #NEVERCLINTON #JAILCLINTON #VOTETRUMP #AMERICAFIRST #TRUMP

If we had same %employment now @BarackObama & peers inherited 1/3/07, >9 MILLLION more would be employed!
.@ITTRP @BarackObama ...it was Bush and friends who caused the Great Recession. Trump was a part of that. Obama got us out of it. #dumptrump

I still would NEVER vote for Donald Trump. There is no justification for him.Hillary ain't the best either.But she's mentally stable.
Amazing that you consider a pathological liar "mentally stable".
Yupp I sure do! #ImWithHer stop hating. That's one thing I notice about u conservatives. U all suffer with penis envy.
You're a case study in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection …
lol, god only knows what u are. You're probably a troll sitting behind a computer. U obviously have nothing better to do. #FuckOff
Your hashtag only serves to prove what I said is right.
I hate you can't be our generation's FDR! (terms, so to speak). We still need you.
@HCAlanTurner How many jobs were lost during the same time?
the one who denies it only God knows what to call him.... Bravo President BHO!
impacting the economy!
Folks have forgotten the state of the country before you took office. Convenient memory loss
sir please send message wait answer
That's not what Trump and his supports say. No, really, our president has done a bang up job. We're going to miss him.
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM GO!!!!
I suppose that improved employment rate happened on it's own. Opinions are opinions but facts speak volumes.
who's facts??Obamas??Bahaha
8 more years!!!!
The #stimulus president
And the sniveling GOP airheads can't stand it! Thank you President Obama for continuing to be a class act!
one job led to so many other jobs!#strange_topjob_prez
88th consecutive month of SUB-60% Employment under @BarackObama
Worst streak since Jan 1979!!

Thank you President Obama!
congratulations...
And this explains in part why @BarackObama approval ratings are the highest in a long time. Should use @HillaryClinton, along with @VP
You have done a great job, can't say much about the politics all they do is talk a lot of crap and don't do anything.
best president ever

Man I want to work for you, but that didn't work out, I  want you to know that I am very proud of you.  Job well done!
invite me to the White House to have a conversation with you to reflect on the past 8 years.
he would likely laugh at you. Did you forget the crash of 08?  Things are not significantly better?
Not better thanks to him. He saved auto manufacturers,  should have let them go under, would he save you ??
what about the black culture fatalities in America. What about laws that punish unjust killings by cops and pay penalties.
Major what are you doing to help those situations in your community?
DUH. PLENTY.. And you miss defender of Obama on Twitter because you have time to do so I suppose 
Waiting to hear the list of helping your community.
sure let me focus on getting you my list 
Great I would appreciate that.

@BarackObama
he is a wholesome president of universe.
not really, wages are frozen, unemployed and underemployment is still rampant, family and medical events are bankrupting people
And we still don't have 3% annual growth. Someone is really cooking the books over at the White House.
During that time frame, 22 million baby boomers retired.Where is the growth Mr Obama?
this is false as per many business partners I am associated with. Where are the stats on this?
Then why is the country more in debt? Liar
You know you have put millions out of work. Stop lying to your own people.  If we stay Democrats, America is as good as Russia
Why do u Liberal leaders have to be so selfish? Why can't you be a strong leader that America needs?
It is sad how many people are so easily brainwashed so that what ever the liberal elite says they believe it's true. 
I'm proud of my President
after what the DNC did to Bernie Sanders and the American people, you'll be the last Democrat in office. Stand down fool.
hi Mr president like to give you a couple of my designert-shirt
Liberals can't play the double narrative. Either Bernie is needed because the economy sucks OR Obama is great. Which one?
great president
You have led us through tough times to the light at the end of the tunnel; that will be part of your legacy.
QUIT LYING DUDE. #OVERREGULATION wont open a business nor hire people because of YOUR POLICIES. #NOTAXREVENUEFORYOU
another Clinton lying friend
can't tell he did anything by the poverty that I see
Tell that to the 94 million Americans who have stopped looking for a full time job. Obama is worst POTUS EVER!Obama delusional
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY DATA TO PROVE THIS? NET INCREASE OR AGGREGATE?
yea, but "they didn't build that", right?
stop lying to the public! Companies where I worked turned 1/2 their work force to part-timers. Thxs A*S*S Hole Obama!
