@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Time to end gun violence and join the rest of the civilized world.
@freereid @WhiteHouse @BarackObama There's plenty of gun violence elsewhere in the world. Just came from Brazil; they live with it daily.
@JeffreyHastings @WhiteHouse @BarackObama True. But developed countries aside from US have been able to reduce it to near zero.
@freereid @JeffreyHastings @WhiteHouse @BarackObama So countries like France and Norway? Keep swallowing that ignorance. #Sheep #Parrot
@diffinleslie these examples are irrelevant. Overall stats are clear and not debatable- gun laws work to reduce gun violence.
@freereid We don't fit your statistics. They are only applicable to the region they affect. Freedom reigns here. And we shoot less people..
@diffinleslie @freereid Chicago has toughest gun laws in U.S. but is bloody. More laws don't stop criminals who don't respect laws anyway.
@JeffreyHastings @diffinleslie again, random, out of context examples don't prove anything. Chicago's issue is the lax laws nearby.
@WhiteHouse Added your tweet to my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1PyB5OG

Are you serious
@mblairwinters? If you think that's comparable to what we have you're a fool living under a rock.
@POTUS @WhiteHouse
You may not ask anything from me
@mblairwinters. Your disrespect to our POTUS disgusts me. Get lost freakshow! 
 @POTUS @WhiteHouse
Blocked -- you're all mouth; no ears.
@mblairwinters
@POTUS @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama So inspiring!
@BarackObama @WhiteHouse  What I don't get is why more didn't stand up regarding this tragedy, more over the African American community?
@WhiteHouse @petersagal THIS is his answer?  Never let a tragedy go to waste!  Only Obama would make this about Gun Control.  Pathetic. #sad
@vladpryde @WhiteHouse @petersagal I applaud use of the murders as it might motivate people to get something through your useless congress
@Colossis2 @WhiteHouse @petersagal Democrats: Lying, race-baiting, hippie, Communist-loving, Illegal-Alien-embracing, hand-wringing pussies.
Bodies not cold yet, and his speech? It's about Obama, and it's about politics. What a dunce, what a rube, what a useless sack.@WhiteHouse
@CplSoletrain #Hater #GOP #NRA #KKK #FOX  WRONG!  #CharlestonShooting #guncontrol #TooManyTiimes  #FOX says church should have been packing!
@Semasiographic @CplSoletrain I legal gun in that church could have saved many souls. And delivered the deviant to his judgement promptly.
@diffinleslie and he would have still got a few rounds off. No guns in the first place? No deaths
@diffinleslie after all, what good have the guns done the law abiding citizens? Haven't helped in any of the recent shootings have they?
@Colossis2 Step past the anti and learn about actual fact circumstance. The kind the liberal media doesn't mention.
@diffinleslie again, gunmen stopped after they'd started, how many died before they were stopped, but I may be starting to see your point...
@WhiteHouse
Someone remind the "constitutional scholar" the 2nd amendment is not a hunting license & read him the text of his oath of office
@WhiteHouse best regards
@WhiteHouse we want early arrival of UN Security Forces, a formal government working under United Nations and dates of early election
@WhiteHouse we have to sit on one table and discuss issues, which must be informed to public too, other than threatening individuals/groups
@WhiteHouse Destroy every credibility of US, the nation, they earned during 100s of years, break down UN itself, and do whatever you want...
@WhiteHouse and there is no legal interference of US's Constitution in India, until it share "equal voting rights" with Indian civilians....
@WhiteHouse even if body of Mr Obama is also occupied by a foreign soul, for example, he can't go against Constitution of US, against Nation
@WhiteHouse Saudi A. can't face sanctions because these False ID Saudi rulers will then lose their support from their civilians,all your men
@WhiteHouse these Saudi rulers are trying to "criminalize" Saudi Arabia, similar to how Russian rulers criminalize Russia, as spies of US-UK
@WhiteHouse also, the way Russian rulers aren't Russians, their bodies are occupied by foreign souls. similarly Saudi rulers aren't Muslims
@WhiteHouse why all these dramas are kept secret from the common public, to keep helping these ISIL? while threatening people like me too?
@WhiteHouse and why these negotiations of quake-Tsunami-9/11 threats are done with people like me, why don't you say the same to public too?
@WhiteHouse if US-UK controlling bodies of ISIL occupying govt-military-political positions like "Toys", similar to me, what bluffs ongoing?
@WhiteHouse why so much negotiations, if bodies of these ISIL occupying govt-political positions of India are controlled similar to my body?
@WhiteHouse we may only have respectful deportation of good character people only, to US-UK. a usual practice in world too....
@WhiteHouse shameful......
@WhiteHouse how will US-UK do placement on President,PM, Minister, District Magistrate position of India, while 'hiding' it from public too?
@WhiteHouse US-UK must offer 'Equal Voting Rights' for the Indian civilians in their democratic elections,otherwise how will it be possible?
@WhiteHouse sir, i was told, "these people are put on the government-political positions of India, as per the Constitution of US-UK, hence,
@WhiteHouse aren't these ISIL occupying membership of Indian parliament, same people who have been reporting British government for years?
@WhiteHouse its just a shame for government of US-UK, who are watching "False Indian Identity" people, are now voting in parliament of India
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN
@WhiteHouse but Member of Parliament must first go through fair election before voting on a bill. they dont qualify for voting in parliament
@WhiteHouse a change in Constitution occur when the Bill is passed in both parliaments with 66%+ voting, with Live Telecast to common public
@WhiteHouse none of those can be regarded as citizen of India, who were 'granted' citizenship under dictatorship,as against the Constitution
@WhiteHouse many of Member of Parliament of India have been 'secretly' reporting to foreign governments, as per their foreign nationality
@WhiteHouse we can't do crimes in other nations with 50% voting in parliaments of US-UK.Indian public aren't even informed about this crisis
@WhiteHouse we can't discuss democracy in home, if we don't do its practice on the world platform too. these MPs of India are foreign spies
@WhiteHouse many of them were not "Indian Citizen" at the time of election.those who are voting in parliament, have to be put on trial first
@WhiteHouse as many of Member of Parliament were elected while 'deceiving common public,while hiding their "foreign nationality" from public
@WhiteHouse for example of this amendment in constitution, which has no meaning since dictatorship is enforced http://onelawstreet.com/2015/05/prez-assents-constitution-one-hundredth-amendment-act-2015/ …
@WhiteHouse an amendment in Constitution takes longer time, more discussion with many articles in newspapers,"Live Telecast" from parliament
@WhiteHouse no bill is passed in parliament without "Live Telecast" to common public for months of discussion,related articles in newspapers
@WhiteHouse but first member of parliament must go through a fair election as many of them have been deceiving public before asking for vote
@WhiteHouse a Law takes place when the Bill is passed in both parliament, while a change in Constitution occur when passed with 66%+ voting
@WhiteHouse topic, "Changing the Constitution of India"
@WhiteHouse we want a "formal government" working under United Nations, dates of early election, and UN Security Force here, sooner possible
@WhiteHouse "Gandhi then launched a Satyagraha against the tax on salt in March 1930.This was highlighted by the famous Salt March to Dandi"
@WhiteHouse its also Gandhi's principle, "dont pay Tax to that government, which isn't democratically elected." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Salt_Satyagraha_.28Salt_March.29 …
@WhiteHouse "to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Non-cooperation …
@WhiteHouse "In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British educational institutions and law courts"
@WhiteHouse its also the Gandhi's principle,"no one would work for a government which isn't democratically elected." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Non-cooperation …
@WhiteHouse in sum, any new law under dictatorship is just a terrorist attack on the common Indian public, on the World Society as whole
@WhiteHouse and even till now, the common public of India, 1.2billion+ people, are kept unaware of this crisis ongoing in India, shameful...
@WhiteHouse and their follower False ID foreign nationals on government positions deceived "security clearance",required for these positions
@WhiteHouse many of current member of parliament 'deceived' common public every time while asking for vote, while hiding their true identity
@WhiteHouse any new law 'imposed' under Dictatorship without following full democratic procedures, is a terrorist attack on Indian civilians
@WhiteHouse they all qualify for death penalty, which they could avoid because of sudden imposed Dictatorship, longer public isn't informed
@WhiteHouse they first need to be an "Indian Citizen" for these government-political positions as per The 'Constitution' of India,
@WhiteHouse mainly nationals of Bangladesh are occupying government-political positions of India while hiding their identity, a conspiracy
@WhiteHouse many member of parliament of India have been hiding their true identity (foreign nationality) to public before asking for vote
@WhiteHouse a Law takes place when the bill is passed in both parliaments, but first Member of parliament must go through a proper election
@WhiteHouse a bill confirming a new law has Live Telecast to common public from parliament for many months for discussion,in news papers too
@WhiteHouse Democratic elections follow certain processes. and those democratic processes aren't different in US-India-South Africa, example
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN
@WhiteHouse No legal status can be granted to India under dictatorship, until a fair democratic election is held, under watch by US and UN
@WhiteHouse topic, Legality of the Laws under Dictatorship. the Democratic processes and the related Human Rights
@WhiteHouse good day sir
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama you were always my Preisodenito
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama meet the front dodama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama your at sc boos I'm a Jo are we hit
@WhiteHouse also, im waiting for my US passport, looks like im badly trapped in this heavily disturbed country. sooner is possible, regards
@WhiteHouse in fact, its all the mess of BP oil spill, and British government is first responsible for their mess 
http://tbo.com/pinellas-county/impact-of-2010-bp-oil-spill-lingers-20140418/ …
@WhiteHouse we want a 'formal government' while working under United Nations, dates of early election,UN forces to arrive sooner is possible
@WhiteHouse there is no legality of the steps taken under dictatorship. No new law under dictatorship can have any legal status by US or UN
@WhiteHouse there can't be any diplomatic/economic/trade recognition for a country under dictatorship, it has no legal recognition in world
@WhiteHouse and the hope is maintained in people till last breath. US-UN forces must always be ready for India, must not be delayed anymore
@WhiteHouse no matter how much causalities is made, we can't say that we can't defend ourselves/our country,every day starts with a new hope
@WhiteHouse and if we may ensure these key things, there will always be enough space to face the challenges imposed on this country as whole
@WhiteHouse India may need UN forces, led by US, for at least upto 5 to 10 years, even "a fair" democratic election may take a year from now
@WhiteHouse we can't win this war until we capture those who prepared Platform to help form Dictatorship over the largest democratic country
@WhiteHouse if few things go wrong, it would be fixed up, thats it. few people might be doing wrong, not hard, who gotto be found, thats it
@WhiteHouse and its hard to believe that US-NASA wasn't informed about it. even Japan-Germany can't handle people's mind, quake-Tsunami....
@WhiteHouse the souls occupying bodies of Indian military-govt officials,are openly working in behalf of current regime,reporting to UK govt
@WhiteHouse you can occupy body of a person, but you can't get his-her "memory", the experience/knowledge, signature etc...
@WhiteHouse the Dictatorship on India was mainly "handled" by those, who were controlling people's mind, quake-Tsunami threats on civilians
@WhiteHouse we must capture those first who had handicapped Indian government agencies to help form dictatorship,while threatening civilians
@WhiteHouse Indian government agencies were,in fact, made "handicapped" so that no resistance is left against the Dictatorship, confirm it
@WhiteHouse we can't win against terrorism-dictatorship targeting a democratic country,until we first capture those who help these offenders
@WhiteHouse and then Dictatorship over India as the Final Step. first conspiracy was plotted to help these offenders supporting Dictatorship
@WhiteHouse its openly done,first civilians of India were terrorized by quake-Tsunami with putting a control over India during last 6 months
@WhiteHouse sir, there is no difference between terrorists targeting civilians,than those who target civilians by Earth Quake- Flood-Tsunami
@WhiteHouse Offenders occupying government positions of India were first helped by threatening civilians by quake-Tsunami, are they caught?
@WhiteHouse also,first Independence of India was bargained by threatening common civilians by earth quake-Tsunami, has US got guilty behind?
@WhiteHouse How NASA-US couldn't control the terrorism on Indian civilians, done through quake-flood-Tsunami? which helped these offenders?
@WhiteHouse topic,"How NASA-US couldn't control terrorism on Indian civilians,done through quake-flood-Tsunami?which helped these offenders"
@WhiteHouse best regards
@WhiteHouse sir, we would need over 100,000 military personnel of UN Security Forces to have a control over India, how long will it take?
@WhiteHouse US-NASA must kill those foreign nationals occupying govt positions of India, by controlling their body,until we get help from UN
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals helping dictatorship in another country, while being on soil of India, become part of this terrorism on India
@WhiteHouse Foreign nationals helping Dictatorship, while being among Indian civilians in open, they must be put in Wanted List of Interpol
@WhiteHouse put US+UN forces on alert to enter India,with whatever immediate government officials may be sent from UN to help civilians here
@WhiteHouse it first includes Pakistan+Bangladesh whose spies are occupying government positions of India from back door, helped by Britain
@WhiteHouse The Countries guilty in dictatorship-terrorism against Democratic India, must first face sanctions to stop aggression from there
@WhiteHouse and as souls occupying bodies of Saudi rulers-govt-military, may lose support from public, they kept out of sanctions...shameful
@WhiteHouse as they are found guilty in this ongoing terrorism against Largest Democratic Country of world, terrorized with Dictatorship now
@WhiteHouse regardless what happens in India, Saudi A.+UAE must first be imposed with all sanctions, diplomatic/trade all, as the first step
@WhiteHouse without sharing "equal voting rights" for Indian civilians in general elections of US-UK, how did you do these crimes for years?
@WhiteHouse is this finally means for democracy in US-UK? do crimes in India type developing countries,in unity, by their parliament itself?
@WhiteHouse we can't do serious crimes in another country by 50%+ voting in parliaments of US/UK/Aus, where will we head in future this way?
@WhiteHouse and you are responsible to clean your shiits. like how you go to toilet and clear your shiit by yourself, without help of others
@WhiteHouse under a conspiracy, these things were kept secret from common public during last 20+ years.hence you do know what you are doing?
@WhiteHouse the technologies of US,developed there by immigrant professionals of developing countries,and misused by a small economy like UK
@WhiteHouse this process of occupying government positions of India from back door was continued for last 20+ years, which was allowed by US
@WhiteHouse its Britain who placed these foreigners on government positions under False Indian IDs, who first report to British government
@WhiteHouse shameful, 100,000+ govt-military personnel were killed, and bodies are still occupied,not handed over for final official regards
@WhiteHouse its easy to take out souls, in the same way you have put these souls in these Indian military-govt officials bodies,all your men
@WhiteHouse mainly nationals of Bangladesh are on govt-political positions of India, Commonwealth Recruitment, who first report British govt
@WhiteHouse like how my body is controlled from top to bottom from space, what measures are adopted to kill these False ID foreign fighters?
@WhiteHouse hence, it would be easy to kill these offenders/terrorists helping dictatorship in India, by controlling their bodies itself...
@WhiteHouse UK/Commonwealth Recruitment know who are they, where they came from? while controlling their bodies too, similar to my body
@WhiteHouse you can occupy bodies of a person, but you can't get his-her memory, signature etc...
@WhiteHouse these Bangladeshi souls occupying Indian bodies are working for those,who already have experience under Commonwealth Recruitment
@WhiteHouse you can occupy body of a person, can't get his-her memory.
@WhiteHouse even if 90%+ military-govt official bodies are now occupied by Bangladeshi souls,they are working for 10% Commonwealth placement
@WhiteHouse and it would be easy as these people entered into India by "Commonwealth Recruitment", hence you know them, obviously?
@WhiteHouse we want US+UN forces to occupy the key defence areas and government buildings, mainly the nuclear reactors, sooner is possible
@WhiteHouse hence we want direct sealing of border with Bangladesh+pak considering mainly spies of these 2 nations are on govt positions
@WhiteHouse as common Indian civilians are unarmed,Foreign Nationals entered India since dictatorship,must be put in Wanted List of Interpol
@WhiteHouse as its now open that False ID spies on government positions helping foreigner nationals,mainly Pakistani+Bangladeshi enter India
@WhiteHouse sir we first need to put those foreigners in Wanted List of Interpol,who occupying Indian IDs from back door during dictatorship
@WhiteHouse shameful, is this the final outcome of a person, who is known to both the sides of politics of US-UK for years??? shame on you..
@WhiteHouse its 'Foreign Policy' of US-UK, first criminalize Islam and then 'force' those like me to convert into Islam,you people dont like
@WhiteHouse sir,if im receiving life threat to convert into Islam, its in behalf of those soul occupying Saudi bodies,who are spies of US-UK
@WhiteHouse they are criminalizing Saudi Arabia similar to how Putin criminalize Russia.example, by crashing MH17 civilian aircraft recently
@WhiteHouse if Bangladeshis are used for Indian bodies, East Timor are used for Indonesia, and minority of Egypt are used for Saudi bodies
@WhiteHouse along with spies of Israel, those Russian speaking foreigners are used to occupy Russian bodies,with whom Russia had war in past
@WhiteHouse similar to how their Russian mission during Syria war in 2012 was ended with occupying 'total' politics-military-govt bodies...
@WhiteHouse while its also a joke i get in my dream nowdays, "Saddam's body was also occupied by an Arabic minority, an Egyptian itself...."
@WhiteHouse US-NATO came to help Saudi A. against Saddam's Kuwait invasion, and finished with Saudi A as whole when they left it by late 90s
@WhiteHouse during war against Saddam's invasions to Kuwait, a part of Saudi politics-government-military bodies had been occupied by others
@WhiteHouse i even face regular comment, "you talk to ghost of Medvedev whose body was transferred 6-7 times during last one year."
@WhiteHouse while its another issue that the way Russian rulers aren't russians, similarly Saudi rulers aren't even Muslims since early 90s
@WhiteHouse shameful.....
@WhiteHouse what strength they have, other than using Hindu father names on their passport? are these the fighters of Islam,Saudis proud on?
@WhiteHouse is this strength of Saudi Islam,whose fighters entered into India with Hindu father names on the Indian passport?from back door?
@WhiteHouse "what type of Islamic fighters of Saudi Arabia you sent, whose name, including father name on the Indian passport is Hindus?"
@WhiteHouse i also passed my message to Saudi Rulers, who aren't punished for their offence against the largest democratic country of world
@WhiteHouse Nations helped form dictatorship against the largest democratic country of world, are well qualified for all type of sanctions
@WhiteHouse hence,Saudi A+UAE must be recognized as rogue nations, involved in this ongoing Terrorism against the Largest Democratic Country
@WhiteHouse sir,I'm told, foreign nations like UAE-Saudi Arabia are guiding these False ID offenders placed on government positions of India
@WhiteHouse topic, "Terrorized India under Dictatorship by foreign nationals with False Indian IDs, placed here by Commonwealth Recruitment"
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Based on confederate flag logic why is there a single koran or mosque in the U.S. after 3000 dead on 9/11?!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You always show you care about alarming issues. You have always been a champion of #rightsandjustice4all
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama where is the video from the police car cam of dylann roof arrest? Why have the public not seen it yet?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #TakeDownTheFlag
@WhiteHouse we want formal government of India under United Nations, dates of early election, arrival of UN Security Forces, sooner possible
@WhiteHouse we want these information to come on National TV of India, to inform Indian civilians that they are being ruled by foreign spies
@WhiteHouse cases based on lies are being put on mine by these US/UK backed offenders in India, hence im looking for help from rest of world
@WhiteHouse wrong information about me is given to common public,simply because govt of US-UK-Aus want to trap me by these offender in India
@WhiteHouse Indians must get to know that foreign souls occupying bodies of govt-military-political, being helped by US-UK to maintain hold
@WhiteHouse foreign nationals occupying govt-political positions of India are guided to trap me in India, guided by US-UK, are their own men
@WhiteHouse US's allies are those, who are the men of US-UK itself. whoever is an ally of US, whether Saudi A. Turkey etc, are their own men
@WhiteHouse Iraq war was for religion, when Arabic occupying Saddam's body attacked Kuwait.US forces left after a complete take over on S.A.
@WhiteHouse Saudis who are threatenin me for life to convert into Islam,aren't even Muslims,but Arabic minorities occupying bodies of Saudis
@WhiteHouse news is kept secret from common public by US-UK, to help offenders maintain hold on India, simply because they are their own men
@WhiteHouse offenders occupying govt-political-military positions of India, are being defended by govt of US-UK, to help them maintain hold
@WhiteHouse US-UK are defending Offenders on govt-military-political positions of India, whose bodies controlled like 'toys', similar to me
@WhiteHouse good day sir
@WhiteHouse thanks and regards
@WhiteHouse right now im visiting Embassies, trying for help somehow. as im trying for an easy path to help myself, which must be understood
@WhiteHouse and my first demand is to have company of government officials for my rest of life because of serious threats of foreign spies
@WhiteHouse as its true that i would simply hide myself within security, and would never visit even Internet/forums too, once i get help
@WhiteHouse hope Mr President might have put some covers for me also. US is a democratic country and I do expect them having some values...
@WhiteHouse i know that Indian govt is filled with Bangladeshi+Pak spies, men of US/UK/Aus itself, but i would only go to police at end
@WhiteHouse i need to be rescued now, which is being delayed by the governments of US-UK-Aus, simply because the offenders are their own men
@WhiteHouse since dictatorship is made, government agencies doing work have been killed out, im just trapped in this countries,
@WhiteHouse even if i may manage to sit in jail, it does fulfill a level of security concern,as compare to remain in front of foreign spies
@WhiteHouse as always, organizers have prepared a 'platform' to do anything with me, good or bad both. and its only on US, what they allow
@WhiteHouse bastards,once they trapped me in Australia,slowly slowly they hollowed out every good of my life... genration of pigs
@WhiteHouse even as an international student in 2003, going to Australia was all about landing on a Hell, fallen in the gutter of shiits....
@WhiteHouse many years hav gone like this,along with taking over my assets in India itself,while using my family as robots in front of mine
@WhiteHouse it must be agreed in UNSC that i will be approached before trapped or killed by the foreign spies left after me anywhere i go
@WhiteHouse breaking mentally/financially,physical torture-dreams-threatening on roads for years, waiting for me to reach a breaking point?
@WhiteHouse and I dont understand, after wasting billions of dollars, what govts of US/UK/Aus would achieve once im left with no money????
@WhiteHouse while im intentionally kept in the current state????
@WhiteHouse foreign intelligence are allowed to trap me, who are backed by US/UK also, but no defence for a civilian?
@WhiteHouse and which "reason" the US itself pick, whether to harm me or let me back on my life after over 7 years, is my worries,as always
@WhiteHouse rest im preparing myself to leave this country,hopeful to get help in india too.i always have reasons to help myself from bluffs
@WhiteHouse delivering wrong information to common public, using my IDs to do crimes, as funded by budget of UK/US/Aus, is no more a secret
@WhiteHouse even if common people gets mobilized against me, its again because their are guided to do so, under a conspiracy
@WhiteHouse its only the people of US/UK everywhere, which includes both, who may harm or help me. and its just depends, whom you allow....
