@BarackObama When those exploited by capitalists are empowered by owning what the super rich do now, extraordinary things happen. #socialism
@OfficialSPGB no that's no socialism that when they become capitalist and hypocrites, idiots I swear, go to work
@johnchino01 When we all collectively own what the capitalist class do now, that will be real socialism.
@OfficialSPGB that's called theft, we worked our entire lives, paid taxes, donated and you assholes think your gonna just take it. Loaded
@johnchino01 Theft's what capitalists have got away with. They've stolen this world's resources for themselves. Socialism will correct this!
@nataliayusupova We're not crying. We're smiling.The parasite class are on the way out. All humanity will soon own this planet's resources.
@BarackObama Empowering women is our only hope of achieving a balanced world.
@ValMackinnon think about what our country was before women voted, look now, you've been voting for 100 yrs but your so unhappy, go to work
@johnchino01 Johnny, what r u talking about?
@ValMackinnon might be too deep for you
@johnchino01 Johnny, men voted too.
@ValMackinnon not real men, maybe yours but looks like you don't have one
@BarackObama Love from Canada. I wish we had you as our leader.
@Pipmyride99 take him please
@johnchino01 Your GOP candidates are a joke. Embarrassing. And trust me, they don't care about you. They care about your vote but not 'you'
@Pipmyride99 not true we've@known many of them for years some are@very good people.  Can you say that about any on the other side w/o a lie
@barackobama speaking of empowering women, check out this scholarship for women studying STEM http://www.scienceambassadorscholarship.org/ 
@amy_nicoleee but kill babies to do so
@johnchino01 what does studying Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) have to do with killing babies?
@amy_nicoleee they use those parts, I'm an engineer we didn't do that
@johnchino01 I don't think we are talking about the same thing. I am talking about the general fields, you are talking about stem cells.
@amy_nicoleee your right apples and oranges, good luck you will love engineering
