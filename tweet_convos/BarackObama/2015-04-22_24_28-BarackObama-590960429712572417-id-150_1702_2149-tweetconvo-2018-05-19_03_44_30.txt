@BarackObama @AugustLady241  and perhaps the greatest reason for skepticism is the leaders of the movement being unwilling to debate.

@BarackObama How many US jobs would be needed to purify and pipe eastern excess water to the dry west?
@BarackObama Climate change is real, however, there is no consensus that man significant'y affects the climate.
@BarackObama Except by Scientist and people who apprecuate the truth.
