@BarackObama   It would be nice if the damned diplomacy brought the 4 American hostages home. Rose garden ceremony for the traitor.
@BarackObama the best POTUS ever I concur

@BarackObama we are live in world
@BarackObama You suck! Who makes a deal with Iran? You actually believe they will not break the deal?
@Ryan_Keshet @BarackObama who makes a deal with Iran? The rest of the civilized world and our allies!
@Militerryman @BarackObama Remember how israel made a deal with hamas and gaza? and got screwed over? Hamas didn't actually give a shit.
@Ryan_Keshet @BarackObama you are ignorant and not old enough to remember what happened yesterday, the US is not the only one on this deal!
@Militerryman @BarackObama Way to waive off what i initially said!
@Ryan_Keshet because you were too ignorant to have my attention now your block
@Militerryman wtf?You dont make deals with terroristic countries when you are allies with Israel.Iran can turn their back on you at any time
.@BarackObama so then we're was your pressure to get US citizens back? #Moops
@Tyler9ca @BarackObama maybe he should trade weapons 4 hostages the way Reagan did?U dont know what they r during behind closed doors!enough
@Militerryman @BarackObama Your right I don't. But then again neither does anyone else... What happened to transparency?
@Tyler9ca @BarackObama to secretly negotiate release of hostages shouldn't be done in the light
.@Militerryman @BarackObama - Agreed, it is sensitive, but instead, to the rest of the world, POTUS now looks like a fool, while Iran laughs
@Tyler9ca @BarackObama a fool, you are blinded by hate of the man, the whole world CROWN him most admire 5 years running you are now blocked
