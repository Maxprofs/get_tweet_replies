@WhiteHouse I was told that US is only going to support Chip&Signature, not Chip&PIN? /cc: @mousit
@wolfoftheair What's really sad is all three issue C&P cards already in EU and even Canada.  No idea why they're fixated on C&S here.
@mousit banks complaining about not having PIN-reset infrastructure, apparently.
@mousit 'we just replaced our ATMs 4 years ago and haven't made our money back on them, now you want us to replace them AGAIN?!'
@wolfoftheair Because the very idea of managing the PIN via online banking is absurd!
@mousit the PIN (for C&P) is in the chip, supposed to unlock the chip's signature key.
@wolfoftheair Oh, huh.  I did not realize it was stored within the chip itself.  Always thought it was like a cryptogram sent to bank.
@mousit chip&pin is a smart card. PINs are used to unlock key on card, used to sign a transaction. But this is broken by EMV somehow?
@WhiteHouse Still not the President's job.
@laurakfillault @WhiteHouse Commerce, Homeland Security, and Justice's jobs. 3 executive departments, overseen by President. #YesItIsHisJob
@WhiteHouse @itsmeerikat this is how it's been in Europe for years. Glad to see we will finally be catching up with the times & security.
@PrincessMarthaD @WhiteHouse Yes it has been a long time coming! Hopefully soon, and hopefully required by all card issuers.
