@WhiteHouse Meanwhile, back in reality, it's open season on police officers (thanks to you) & ME Christians and you are SILENT. #evil
@theladyjane Cops have never been safer and Christians control virtually everything in the country. What are you talking about? @whitehouse
@ACMESalesRep @TheLadyJane Cops are on edge because our president has put a target on their backs. We were found as a Christian nation
@Sassygramps1 Wrong on both counts. Violence against cops is in decline and the US was founded as a secular nation. Read the 1st Amendment.
@ACMESalesRep You can find statistics either way, but open your eyes to recent events. Constitution=freedom of religion but Christian bases.
@Sassygramps1 No, it explicitly forbids giving one religion preference. Stop letting yourself be misled by political hacks.
@ACMESalesRep I didn't say one religion I said freedom of religion. The Constitution is based on Christian values too bad we've lost them.
@Sassygramps1 And I said, no, the Constitution explicitly rejects the “values” of any one religion. The US was founded as a secular nation.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio No doubt, we must face this crisis, act now, for our sake and the sake of future generations!
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio What Happens Before War?- https://youtu.be/cUGu73hnjdY 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio The greatest threat to this planet is those like Obamanation who desires to play god.

@_Genius28 @LeoDiCaprio I fear the most vexing threat is posed by superintelligent AGI.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio با اين روند فيلم 2012 را در واقعيت شاهد خواهيم بود.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio @POTUS @Elysee @UN @NRA Danny, world leaders do not mention #MassExtinction or daily radiological weapon assaults
@WhiteHouse @suite_rose_k @LeoDiCaprio Laq amenaza mas urgente es el cambio de gobierno de los ee uu. Siguen las guerras o paz mundial.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio I'd say climate change is minor. Take a geology class to find how small human emissions actually are, it's shocking
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio has a huge yacht which burns thousands of gallons of diesel fuel...#hypocrite
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio I agree with you and @BernieSanders! Let's put the blue back in our planet, House and Senate. #Bernie2016

#climatebollocks
@WhiteHouse @solhog @LeoDiCaprio Yes and no: #ClimateChange is a consequence of our dramatic exponential demography.
@mimi_mato Not as much as the increased over-consumption in rich populations. @WhiteHouse @solhog @LeoDiCaprio
@jomonvisst @WhiteHouse @solhog @LeoDiCaprio rich populations are part of the global population, isn't it?
@mimi_mato @WhiteHouse @solhog @LeoDiCaprio When writing I realise I don't know the growth rate of the richest billion since  WW2.
@jomonvisst @WhiteHouse @solhog @LeoDiCaprio less than the poorest, but the Industry violence is linked to the population density, worldwide
@mimi_mato @WhiteHouse @solhog @LeoDiCaprio Industry violence? How can industry be without rich people to pay it?
@dearhest @WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio Climate change is a serious problem and the whole world is feeling and seeing the change. Everyone wakeup
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio @POTUS @Elysee @UN @UN_Spokesperson Still in denial about #MassExtinction? #ActOnClimate http://www.climatechangemassextinction.com

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio "Democrats are the most urgent threat facing our entire species."
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio Personally I think Trump is becoming the biggest threat to our nation and humanity.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio WE earthlings are the biggest threat to our species! Look at the $BILLIONS wasted on #instrumentsofwar
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio Except, of course, the slow breakdown of classic baseball cards!
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio @BarackObama That and the Republican Party, of course!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio I so not agree!!!!
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio RT
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio The biggest threats facing our species are Democrats and Hollywood actor shills who think they know anything.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio: Yes, but if we don't include man's massive aquatic thermal contribution, as a contributing factor, we will fail.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio totally disagree
@WhiteHouse this is serious
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio two hypocritical sources of dumbshit, douchebag slobber.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio Humans are the most significant threat to the species.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio Over-population more like it.
@WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio 
Why is Marijuana a class #1 substance?

@sunlorrie @lesman50 @WhiteHouse @LeoDiCaprio @Kathleen_Wynne #onpoli Still, Kat does have her supporters.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @LeoDiCaprio even if it isn't, why play Russian roulette with our habitat and Eco-system.
