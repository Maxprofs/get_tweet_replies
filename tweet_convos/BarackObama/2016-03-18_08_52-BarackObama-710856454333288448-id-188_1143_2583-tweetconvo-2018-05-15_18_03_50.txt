@BarackObama Let the People decide, NOT YOU
@ChatRevolve @BarackObama The people already decided, when they elected Obama for eight years, and not 7.
@AttentiAlGatto @ChatRevolve @BarackObama 
And a Republican Senate, more recently.
@Ifitsthisname @AttentiAlGatto @ChatRevolve @BarackObama  The American People have seen What a Mistake Voting These Nazi Republicans in.
@StageYaneu @AttentiAlGatto @ChatRevolve @BarackObama 
Yeah. OK. The Republicans are doing what Schumer and Biden called for.
@Ifitsthisname @AttentiAlGatto @ChatRevolve @BarackObama When Was it2006 or75 Years ago?One of them said Obama started this in 2006 w/alito!
@StageYaneu @AttentiAlGatto @ChatRevolve @BarackObama 
Obama did vote to filibuster Alito. That is the definition of obstruction. Keep up.
@Ifitsthisname @AttentiAlGatto @ChatRevolve @BarackObama I know this but was in 2006 ten Years ago
@BarackObama  i love you so much
@Ramromy_2002 @BarackObama I luv MYPRESOBAMA more...so...
@BarackObama go trump it will take him to clean up the mess you have made
@BarackObama  You would not know fair if it slap you in the face!
@BarackObama But Schumer and Biden told us that "no" nomination process was fair. Heck, Democrats passed a *resolution* for Pete's sake.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Why isn't Obama nominating a progressive judge to court? What a bad, bad appointment for the president who ran on "change".

@BarackObama Merrick is a poor choice Mr. President. He doesn't even support the 2nd Amendt. Chose a candidate that will uphold the Const !!
@BarackObama You don't get to tell the Senate what to do. Separation of powers. It's in the Constitution.
@BarackObama Senate should follow #BidenRule Your 7 years have divided us with partisan attacks. Let voters decide.
@BarackObama help me get justice for my baby
@BarackObama @OFA  Senators who refuse a hearing and cast a vote for the "NOMINEE for SCOTUS" should be RECALLED, STEP DOWN and NOT BE PAID.
@BarackObama Thank you for all your efforts, even in the face of such a hateful and divisive republican effort since day 1.
@BarackObama hear my voice: @Senate_GOPs DO NOT GIVE IN TO THIS COMMUNIST @POTUS !!! #DoYourJobFriday

@BarackObama @OFA : Its a very important point indeed. Many criminals dont believe from their inception that SUN is alone lightening.
@BarackObama @OFA : It is the fact of violence and matching the live evidence now , they started believing that SUN will not clean dirt.
@BarackObama @OFA : The violence can be stopped when real people are engaged to change the dirty people with SUN education.
@BarackObama @OFA : Dont expect anything further apart from SUN education. The cleaniness is possible only with clear water. The change.
@BarackObama garland is a great choice and should have a confirmation hearing soon. Any Senator who refuses should be voted out of office.
@BarackObama We'll take Schumer's, Reid's, Leahy's, and Biden's advice. No vote, here's why Mr President: http://imjustacop.com/opinion/judge-garland-vote-or-not/ …
@BarackObama @OFA never you should not use him like the pawn

@BarackObama. Any legally nominated person deserves fair consideration by elected representatives.
@BarackObama working on it Sir...Senator Portman is going to think I'm stalking him...
@BarackObama. Majority of Americans elected this man president. McConnell & his ilk have always preferred to follow smaller splinter group.
@BarackObama سلام...
@BarackObama It is indeed the Senate's turn.  But, don't hold your breath. https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/appoint-merrick-garland-supreme-court-forthwith-and-senate-advice-and-consent … #SCOTUS #SCOTUSnominee
@BarackObama  Give the people a fair chance who they want to elect as nominee in the primary, get rid of super delegates. Unfair
@BarackObama @OFA what's that
@BarackObama @OFA 
THUMBS UP TO FAIR HEARINGS.  BLESSINGS, CLAUDIA

@BarackObama @OFA Take a long walk off a short pier!
@BarackObama With you all the way
@BarackObama @OFA sit back and shut up you've had your turn  Berry !
@BarackObama @OFA The people are either on board with you or they will get left behind. We support you 100% Mr. President. Forward March.
@BarackObama We "hear" he's anti-2nd amendment. So we fairly deny him further consideration.
@BarackObama Even better wait the election and let Bernie appoint former President Obama. Yay
@BarackObama The Constitution gives the right and the duty of making appointments to the Court to the President.
@BarackObama 1. No. 2. Biden Rule. 3. Schumer Doctrine. 4. Lulz.
@BarackObama @OFA he's not a progressive Mr President...I don't think you made the right choice. You made the right's choice.
@_Dabble_ @BarackObama @OFA he made a FAIR choice, a compromise...if he is not confirmed hope this bites Repubs in the ass
@CarolJanes1 @BarackObama @OFA that's what he's done for the entirety of his time as president. Constantly making compromises to the GOP
@_Dabble_ @BarackObama @OFA I am a Democrat & understand your feeling..but our govt ONLY works when both sides compromise
@CarolJanes1 @BarackObama @OFA the GOP is quietly moving the Democratic party further and further right while they nominate fascist

@CarolJanes1 @BarackObama I'm an anarchist lady. Also it should have read "go live on an island." Silly statist.
@BarackObama @OFA  he's had to fight his entire presidency for what we elected him to do, hard to get things done with all Rep. against him
@BarackObama @OFA @MikeRodNews
@BarackObama As a liberal who voted for you twice, I think this expresses my feelings on Merrick Garland.
@BarackObama nobody cares what u say anymore!!! Continue pretending you r the leader of the free world! Putin kicked your butt in Syria,sad!
@BarackObama @OFA Voices are made but who listens? Lots of promises in unbalanced economy....wrong combination thanks to selfish leadership.

@BarackObama The GOP's refusal to do their job and their immature tantrum in complete disregard to the constitution is unconscionable.
@BarackObama @OFA after supporting a dictatorial president like Lula, you should be ashamed, Mr. President. Shame on you!
@BarackObama Constitution is clear and President Obama has done his job. Now it's the Senate's turn to do its job https://www.barackobama.com/ 
@BarackObama @OFA or we could do what YOUR VICE PRESIDENT SAYS WE SHOULD DO. LIAR.
