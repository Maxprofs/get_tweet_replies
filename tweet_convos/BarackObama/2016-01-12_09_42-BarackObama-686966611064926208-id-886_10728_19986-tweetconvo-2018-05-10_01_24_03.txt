Man we wish it was you still! 
He is so missed. The greatest President that I have lived through I pray real soon that we all get to witness Trump get what's coming to him. He is the very appearance of evil and the worst President of all time who will get his just reward....soon!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump  THIS is what a REAL President looks like! Listen and LEARN!
#ReleaseTheMemo #WeThePeople Worst Fake Pres in history.
Hands down, worst POTUS in our history. You're just drinking his Kool ade if you think Obama cared. He still doesn't care about anything but power and money. He hates whites, cops and the military. He lied about being born in Hawaii and now admits he was born in Kenya.

Would any of you please point to anything good that Obama did? He divided this country like no other.
There are multiple lists available if you were actually interested. You can't blame Obama for dividing the country.  He didn't invent tacism and intolerance. That was you and your friends, and THAT is what squats in our White House today, dividing this country 'like no other.'
I fucking love the success done by one of the best to ever do it.
Be loved Obama,always flight for American pepole. As a American Chinese always support to you.
I think of you every time I hear the song One Last Time, imagining how tough it must have been to know what you did about Trump and walk away with dignity and grace, hoping he'd do the right thing. We miss you.
Wow

Hey @BarackObama!
Her name is Kate Steinle !
#SOTU
This is the finest of all American Presidents and so many of us as Americans respect & love BARACK and Michele OBAMA!Praise God for them!
Amen and I do agree.
Wow, this just shows how manipulative Obama is. The irony behind this speech, is that he never did anything about these issues.Sure he addressed these issues, but he never did ANYTHING about these issues. But dont you worry, Donald Trump is cleaning it up. #MAGA
Hilarious.......good try
I miss you everyday President Obama. This such an aweful day for American. Please speak out !!!
That http://true.it  is so divided today.
God Bless you President  Obama
Who cared for all our citizens all. You reach out and made an impact " Thank God you were not double minded.
@Olga25492558 @BarackObama Correct, our children's children will feel the effect of the damage he has done.
@Olga25492558 @fishin156 @BarackObama No, take a step back to morality. No more baby killing and no more boy meats boy.
Barack Obama "Out Destiny remains our choice. It is because of our people, that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong. It is you, our citizens, who make our union strong."
SIGH you are still missed. This is how it's supposed to be done
I agree!

@mattjmichaelson @maxgladstone @Steph_Neely perhaps you should take potus off of these tweets. Perhaps.
@kopicaps @mattjmichaelson @Steph_Neely *considers* naaaaaaah
Mr President you are sorely missed.  Thank you for thinking us during this troubling time.
Mr. President you were the most compassionate and honest president we ever had. You cared about all people of in the US and pulled us out of huge financial disparity.  No one can ever erase the truth. We love and miss you.
you're cool
I just can't get over you Mr. President. We miss you and your clarity in thoughts and speech.

FLASHBACK: Obama makes a 2008 campaign promise to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. 

He later broke that promise, used the U.N. as a politi…
This is propaganda. Just like bush, Obama started useless wars in Libya & Syria. He left Iraq too early and created ISIS
He made it easier for people to get welfare, which increased the number of people not in the workforce. He destroyed
Race relations by refusing to tell people Michael Brown wasthe aggressor the day he was shot& handsup dontshoot was alie

This is something worthy of our respect.
Look at this Trump. No way you could do any of these things.

I miss him. You may not agree w/ all his policies. And that's ok. That's democracy. But PBO represented this country with class and honor.
I agreed with all his policies. Republicans hated him because he was not a republican.
