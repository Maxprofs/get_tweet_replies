@WhiteHouse @BarackObama It is time to start enforcing the laws already on the books.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and over 50 are able to work for Dept. of Homeland Security
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama The US was attacked by terrorists, liberal response give up your rights. #LiberalLogic
@WhiteHouse 

Yes. Because they weren't guilty of a prohibiting crime. Duh.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama need to decouple gun control from fight on terrorism matter of credibility.
@WhiteHouse The question is: Why the hell would a normal citizen need an assault rifle? It can't be used for hunting & only has one purpose.
@The_Rev_Ted @WhiteHouse Hunting has nothing to do with it. The question is: How many times do you have to be told? 2A not about hunt
@TheTruthUHate2C @WhiteHouse No it's nothing to do with hunting, it's to do with very preventable mass loss of life. Fully backed by NRA.
@The_Rev_Ted @WhiteHouse In other words, you have absolutely no idea what the 2nd amendment is about.
@TheTruthUHate2C @WhiteHouse Actually yes I do & the NRA manipulate it in the worst possible ways.
@The_Rev_Ted @WhiteHouse The NRA is comprised of Americans, such as myself. Gun bans kill legal gun owners - only criminals will have guns.
@TheTruthUHate2C @WhiteHouse So your 'legal' guns don't kill the children of responsible owners? How many child deaths in 2015?
@The_Rev_Ted @WhiteHouse Nope, guns don't kill people. People kill people. Not a single child/person has been harmed by lawful gun owners.
@WhiteHouse and you want Congress to bypass the 5th Amendment Right of Due Process of Law so that you can place people on a No Fly List.
@SSReaney @WhiteHouse 5th amendment ia right to remain silent.
@LotonC @SSReaney Actually, a part of 5th Amendment protects a person from revealing info that may lead to self incrimination. Not the same.
@JohnsPhotos @LotonC  yes, 5th guarantees the right to a grand jury, etc. It also requires  “due process of law” be part of any proceeding
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how did we get 2000 terrorists in the country? Who's on the list how many veterans?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama God Knew us BEFORE the Foundation of World was Laid. MURDERING those in the Womb "God Knows and Created" IS Murder
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Though the Population has "Greatly Grown since 2009", outside of TERRORSTS (Evil People) Acts, MURDERS Dropped
@whitehouse Nothing will work until the executive branch stop facilitating our enemies @potus
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I love these responses.  Mr. President... are you listening?  BTW u need better interns that know how to FUD
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama With so many shootings, shouldn't there be at least a story where victims saved themselves with guns they bought?
Wikileaks is just what we all hoped would happen with Mulder and the Xfiles... 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@z_007_z @412V70 @WhiteHouse @BarackObama such a class act. I hope he will endorse #Bernie

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama To many Good and Decent Americans are on that No-Fly List. TRUTH, GUN Murders and Killings Down yearly since 2009
@WhiteHouse @Pancheers In 1996,1 man & his legally acquired guns killed 35 people, our Government stepped up. How many lives has this saved?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama stop blaming congress, defeat ISIS, close borders, pay off 18 TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT
@WhiteHouse Why are people on the terror watch list still in the country? They're safe providing they don't purchase a gun?
@RITH40C @WhiteHouse Exactly! Because Obama is TOTALLY LYING TO US!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ROMANS 1:16-32, Understanding LAST HALF of Verse 32 for ALL are worthy of Hell who Vote For, Support, Upholds such

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I do NOT appreciate being threatened by Folino of the Mafia, for challenging facts of Sandy Hook.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama neither is sympathy for muslims
@WhiteHouse How many of them were criminals? It seems you have as little respect for the 4th amendment as you do for the 2nd or 1st.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama congress should impeach you
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama and we currently have a TREASONIST traitor Muslim in the White House.
@WhiteHouse aka @FLOTUS Corrupt Judas, sending evil jealous zombies to for one Hit My Car @LibertyMutual ! @BarackObama @Youtube @CNN +

@WhiteHouse NO what Congress should do is impeach our liar-in-chief.
#impeachObama
@WhiteHouse Ok I'm on board as long as you add Alex Jones, Katrina Pierson - anyone who elicits attacks on minorities - on watch lists too.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama My phone is secure fingerprint ID and instant deactivation if misused. A weapon that costs thousands has none?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama if they did it legally the government fucked up BIG TIME BUT most likely it was bought illegal  its all bullshit
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama       One of the worst Presidents in US history.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that is the only kind of gun control that you should implement...We Americans need a way to protect ourselves
@WhiteHouse Maybe ignore PC considerations and observe and enforce current gun laws equally and universally?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama http://idolportraits.com/ 
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Write your congressional represetatives!  Force them to do something instead of standing still.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it's illegal to deny rights based on suspecting.  Due process is required and can be done here. Don't break ur oath
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #yourapussy
TSA found 73 airport workers with terrorist ties @BarackObama. Plenty on plate without visiting what Pelosi/Reid left undone! @WhiteHouse
As Bill Clinton came in gun murders were 9 /100k in US @BarackObama. Reduced to 3/100k by end of GW Bush term thanks to both. @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama HEY HUSSEIN, THOSE MUSLIMS WERE NOT ON THE LIST
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama melhor assim
@WhiteHouse Just ban guns, or ban ppl from buying or owning them. Buying a gun should be as socially irresponsible as drinking & driving.
@WhiteHouse @kshaw58 What's that join the P/C ,Get a clue ! J. W

@WhiteHouse assault is an action not an object
@WhiteHouse This list is bogus even the anti-American Civil Liberties Union agrees! There were members of congress on there.
Any list of US citizens made by gov't is a violation of due process(5th&14th) Violating Constitutional rights isn't who we are! @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Heres what Congress should do to make America safer...IMPEACH OBAMA
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Here is what congress should do to make it harder for foreigners running for president:
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama , Objection: relevance! This wouldn't have prevented the last terrorist attack professor.  #wahhabism #SunniProblem
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #StopGunViolence After Columbine massacre when Congress still cared they banned assault weapons. Sadly ban expired
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Really? You want to deny American citizens their civil rights without due process of law?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  dont it #Harder for citizens to protect themselves#Assult. This is L.A.W.: #LiesAdgitatingWar. 
#FreedomToProctect
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 2000 people on a secret list were able to buy guns? And?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama perhaps the issue then is border security..
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama if they were on the terror "watch" list, why did the federal government allow these purchases? #DoSomething
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why is the word LEGALLY omitted from this cute little saying?  Did they LEGALLY purchase them?  More pablum.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama it's a WATCH list, you can't take away const rights because some1 is on a phantom list based on a "suspicion"
#ronaldgod @WhiteHouse @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama laws already exist for issues obama wants, their just not enforced!!!!!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Since you are obviously incapable of handling this job, please quit and let someone else take over
A esquerda nega mas o que escrevo é uma avaliação neutra.  Sem partidarismo. @WhiteHouse @POTUS @BarackObama
@WhiteHouse we just need tougher background checks.
Pelo que eu vejo desarmar somente as pessoas de bem não diminiu a violencia. Mas aumentou. @WhiteHouse @POTUS @BarackObama
Criminosos continuam livremente armados e matando nas ruas. O desarmamento não alcansou os criminosos.@WhiteHouse  @POTUS @BarackObama
Presidente, não gosto de armas e por mim, não existiriam. Aqui no Brasil o controle só controlou as pessoas  de bem.  @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Just say no to guns
@WhiteHouse...Then what would the paranoid have to hold on to?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama may look foolish to some, sound boring to others, but yet I ask so do we just fold our arms or sleeves?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama What's wrong with that picture
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama That's just absurd.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Umm, the problem is Mr Obama, there is no due process with your "list", which makes it unconstitutional..
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Epic fail! And who is losing their jobs over stupidity?  No one! Normal people get fired..
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Sadly congress won't do anything unless a member gets personally affected.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what about the 50,000 + that you are letting?
@WhiteHouse here's an idea: you take care of ISIS (a constitutional duty) and then we can talk about you taking our rights #guncontrol
@WhiteHouse are the terror watch list and the no fly list the same thing?  and were the #SanBernadino shooters on either list?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama stop letting them in our country and they won't be able to buy guns.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I don't fly and bet the Isis isn't flying here. They are walking, swimming, and driving across. Or you let them in.
@WhiteHouse ,Top legislative body of US constetution and US congress or SENATE controled presidency like Bush junior,Bill clinton and Beli(5
@WhiteHouse ,President is a political person not interfaire to privacy of citizen in the name of personal freindship of Mockerry! (4)
@WhiteHouse ,president not the father of United States of America or founder of nation to decide everything out of his limit!(3)
@WhiteHouse ,But until government or your president never courage any civillion gentelman to appriciating civillion securty!Present (2)
@WhiteHouse You say don't blame all Muslims for acts of terror yet you blame assault weapons and NRA members for mass shootings. Hypocrite.
@WhiteHouse how about only allowing US citizens the right to bare arms constitution should only apply to US citizens.
@WhiteHouse ,I think Gun and any weapon purcheged by any gentel US citizen for only self defence under the US constitution and UN Charter(1)
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama that's like giving pyromaniacs matches and lighter fluid, doesn't make sense does it, what's wrong with this bill?
@WhiteHouse Don't you have a phone and a pen? I thought California already had an assault weapons ban. Sheesh.
@WhiteHouse correction: The last 4 presidents had up to 20 mass shootings, @BarackObama has up to 160 mass shootings...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Where are "Tough Guys" @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @SenTedCruz ? NRA won't let them vote for common sense.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama what about pipe bombs and IED's funny how that wasn't mentioned last night and the terrorist had them...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Here's a little English lesson for you.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why do we have 2000 people on a #terrorist #watchlist  in the #usa clean up #illegalimmigration #expiredvisas
@WhiteHouse You control the list Mr. POTUS, use your resouces to clean up & purify the list.  Take objections away from critics.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Mr. President, with all due respect, the no fly list don't appear to be the problem. Privileged Americans is.

@WhiteHouse Cong must pass the bill to stop trying to ousting Prez Assad in Syria and overhauling all vile Wahabi regimes in Gulf
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama How many of these unsavoury individuals have committed a relevant crime with such implements?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama NRA has a huge influence in the congress and people mind
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama we should quit worrying about the purchase of guns go after the people that are not indigenous to this country.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama congress always rule in favor of the companies that make weapons

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama there should be a ban on guns or stricter rules to have guns. When army & police are protecting the public y guns?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama If ONE smart gun is sold, all guns must then be smart guns? Set up undercover FBI dealerships and sell smart guns.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how many of these are still on the list tell the hole story
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Whatever works, Thank you, for all you have done for this country, even though many people don't give you credit.
@WhiteHouse   Even your own DHS employees that are on the list?

@WhiteHouse sporting rifles, which are not assault weapons. To purchase any firearm you must pass a background check through the NICS system
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama all the white trash Christians should be banned from buying guns.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama benden önce ve sonra dusunemezsiniz
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama sonra yani vatliginizi ve gercekliliginizi varlığa anlattıktan sonra siz anımsar ve bilirsiniz.
@WhiteHouse because they have not been manufactured for civilian use since the early 1980s. You must be talking about semi automatic
@WhiteHouse Then you'll simply place every American on this watch list, you already put random people on it without due process.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama yasarim,yaşayıp gerçeği öğrendikten sonra size anlatirim,bilgilerim ve size anlattıklarımsizinleiletişim kurdukatan
@WhiteHouse You have to wait for the paperwork to return. Then you can go buy your assault weapon. They are extraordinarily expensive
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ve bu düşüncelerinizi önce 13.boyuta sonra kendi aklıma getirebilir,zamanınve maddeninolmadığıanlarda3 saniyeligine
@WhiteHouse It already is very difficult to purchase assault weapons. You have to file forms with and pay a $200 tax stamp. Then after that

@WhiteHouse NO FLY LIST is a joke. Too many ppl on there that shouldn't be. 45K under GWB, 700K under Obama. No fly list is flawed.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Should clarify/explain fixing due process concerns when it comes to No Fly List/guns. Losing messaging war on this.
