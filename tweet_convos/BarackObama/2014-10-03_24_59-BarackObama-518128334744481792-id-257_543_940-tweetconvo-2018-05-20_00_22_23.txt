@BarackObama Free Leonard Peltier Please.
@BarackObama raising minimum wage is a bad idea. Ask any economics person.
@EbolaTour @BarackObama Give him a strong hug.
@BarackObama You have no idea how the economy works! Doing that will kill businesses and cause job loss.
@SilvrDrgn And who made u an expert on economics?
@theAuthoritah Family business. Please explain to me what makes you think you are.
@SilvrDrgn So you base your opinion on nothing? That shows.
@theAuthoritah Typical liberal deflection. Do you own a business? Answer my questions. Prove your points or shut your pie hole.
@SilvrDrgn Yes. Never paid less than minimum wage. The question was who made u an expert on economics?
@theAuthoritah Never said I was an expert. Are you? Where does the money come from to pay employees? What happens when that wage goes up?
@SilvrDrgn It comes from Customers who buy your product. Elementary.
@BarackObama wish you were my president. My friends and l think you are a great president.
@BarackObama hw is ur family doin
@barackobama
@BarackObama better for you to be world presdent and raise wages everywhere
@BarackObama I bet he never looks at this lol.

@BarackObama you a blessing to America and the world. .long live my president!
@BarackObama Or the people stuck in minimum wage jobs can stop complaining and go out and get a real job...
@BarackObama Cause were poor until you do that for real...Period.

@BarackObama are less skilled.  I earned a MS in Pharmacology, BA in Biology, but want to attend HLS to impact many significant reforms.
@BarackObama Block immigration because it's good for America.  There are many unemployed Americans like myself. Don't tell me that Americans
@BarackObama Oh! Poor Americans.Capitalists r motivating u for slavery.
@BarackObama a carrot dangled in front of a horse, by the time they get this increase they'll be ravenous enough to eat the hand holding it
@BarackObama hy
@BarackObama The USA was  built  on the assumption  that a rising  tide lifts all ships .
@BarackObama but how come a few thousand terrorists of the isis are strongest military power of the USA?
@BarackObama L'isis vince sugli USA ma come mai ?
@BarackObama la potente Stati Uniti si fa beffare da poche migliaia di arabi che continuano a decapitare e uccidere?
@BarackObama ma come mai gli Stati Uniti non riescono a sconfiggere l'isis in pochi giorni e di fanno tenere sotto scacco da pochi assassini
@BarackObama ma come mai gli usa potenza militare non riesce a distruggere l'isis in una settimana!
@BarackObama good evening Mr.president
@BarackObama hi am from tanzania
@BarackObama it awesome
@BarackObama the minimum wage we have now is ridiculous. cost of living has gone up 20%. the experts say no but i know what i pay for things
@BarackObama Yup
@BarackObama Great
@BarackObama dat is very good mr prisident
@BarackObama 
Go nawaz go
@BarackObama how about you let us write off student loan interest AND principle and think how many could get out of debt. Never mind u suck
@BarackObama @why not
@BarackObama You mean bc it increases the cost of living?Making the poor even poorer. #NotSomethingYouKnowAbout #DontRaiseTheWage #URNOTPoor
@BarackObama You mean bc it increases the cost of living? Making the poor even poorer. #NotSomethingYouKnowAbout #DontRaiseTheWage
@BarackObama when you raise the minimum wage employers have to hirer less people.
@BarackObama yep that's how he will be seen.
@Slayer0470 You'll still be an unhappy person
@BarackObama with his assistance. Most criminal and corrupt ever. Epic fail.  He was a terrorist sympathizer .
@Slayer0470 You are a sort of terrorist
@BarackObama system . Allowed illegal to flood across the border and over run the welfare system. Isis took over the Middle East
@Slayer0470 Irrationality took over your life
@BarackObama 100 years from now history book will read Barak Hussein Obama worst president in history who managed to tank the health care
@Slayer0470  We'll see who writes the history. It certainly won't be you since you're barely literate.
@BarackObama you can't make those jobs so you raise wages to make it look like your doing something. losers! Epic fail
@Slayer0470 Epic doesn't even begin to describe the scope of your fail
@BarackObama those jobs are meant to be starter jobs. Why don't you creat industry here so people have good paying jobs to move on to
@Slayer0470 You don't get a debate with all the crazy shit you tweet
It's ridiculous for you to attempt it after the things you've said
@BarackObama no it's not. Those jobs will raise wages them cut their work force and raise prices. So worker will have to double their load.
@Slayer0470  You should just throw your computer away and forget Twitter exists. Everything you say is an embarrassment to your family
@BarackObama  I hope it does pass the wages r long time coming
@BarackObama: 
Yep!  It raises costs all around; hence, inflation!  
#ryanddowns
@BarackObama too many burger flippers in your economy. Min wage wasn't ever suppose to support a family.
@BarackObama raising minimum wage will only cause inflation and make the problem worse for everyone else. #getaclue
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I donot buy this concept, top ones should invest in putting up mfr units & such like businesses instead of shares to Inc empl't
@BarackObama i agree with this but please dont let flights from affected areas of Africa into our country....i fear the worst
@BarackObama You have no clue what raising minimum wage would do for us. You are incompetent.
@BarackObama  You are wrong. Minimum wage was never used for people to support their families. Many will lose their jobs
@BarackObama I feel that every little bit helps some family out there.  But if you need to work you will take a minimum wage job or two jobs
@BarackObama WH estimate  28million workers benefiting vs Pew Research1.5M?

.@BarackObama 

Dumbass.

@BarackObama raising min wage increases prices on ALL products. Everyone suffers. Basic economics Barry.
@BarackObama Your hawkish military policies are still a betrayal of the American working class.
@barackobama is that true ?
@BarackObama AN EFFORT TO SETTING UP FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATION< HEALTH AND TRAINING HUMAN CAPITAL< ANY DONATION ARE MOST WELCOME
@BarackObama never has been in the past, has just made prices go up an still in the same place except taxes are higher. Sure U want that
@BarackObama @Royal_beans military should be getting a pay raise NOT fast food workers!!!

@BarackObama
@BarackObama SMH. You're too smart for this! Stop it!
@BarackObama Have you ever thought about telling all the truth to the people? We had faith in you Mr.President. What happened whith you?
@BarackObama #RaiseTheWage would lift all of us.  Middle class salaries would rise as well.

@BarackObama Who has $10.00 for a hamburger? Who has money to give someone that us a shovel on a job in order to get thing done? Your sick!
@BarackObama who cares about minimum wage. How about you do something about these inbound ebola flights from Africa #ebola

@BarackObama  cool obama ;)
@BarackObama  what about those making 10-15/hr now??? Do they get a pay increase as well since the price
