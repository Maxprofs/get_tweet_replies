thats a really good idea
I have faith that President Obama will continue to do great things to save human kind after office because it's his destiny.
as long as he doesn't have the power to spend my tax dollars like a drunk sailor, he can keep on w/"great things".
WRONG THIS IS WHERE HIS MOBSTER TECHNIQUES COMES.....HE WILL POCKET IT WITHOUT YOU KNOWING IT.
you mean the way your State Reps have been doing for the past 20+ years?
I have not seen my state reps give iran 1.7 billion then lie about it
@CNBC 2 million units is not enough to combat climate change or create green jobs. A new world, we got it from here on out.
@CNBC
That is a magnificent image for the whole nation
it should be cheap to take my house off the grid, but it's not.
@CNBC freeze the account as soon as possible. Request you have to do. freezing the account,remitted back to the United States,
@Sustainablehero As solar is ineffective >18hrs/day, large farms not full answer. Get more from small!
@CNBC Great things like this I want in my country to save human kind and increase better living for my people.
yes its all good till the counties n States like NC n NY have to pay for . intallation So where's the benefit in this..
@CNBC !
@CNBC very nicr
The U.S. spend 38 Billion to kill Palestinian people for occupied and cruel murdered IsraeL Is that your kind of peace? Ashamed

.@BarackObama @bethhartman and @bouldercolorado keeps blowing hot air and gas and money and time, and not 1kWh of local, renewable energy.
@CNBC that's great Mr President, but some of us are focused on @RollingStones tickets today

You know a thing or two about solar https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/specialreports/solyndra-scandal/ …
@CNBC .......so let's cut back on the earth-damaging, dangerous fracking before it's too late for both Earth and us.
congrats to keep earth healthy
In Balloch, people r badly criticising by Pak for long time. Where is ur huminity. OBAMA sir plz take appropriate action.....
big cluster fxxk on the financing side too  due to cockamamie tax credit scheme
@CNBC 
No one will ever develop compressed air engines to power the world.
Cause it is non productive to the system tycoons.
please send some to my beloved country Nigeria
Hey action staff; tell Pres Obama that I don't appreciate his failure in keeping me engaged. I voted twice for u man. U hurt me
@LeoTraub #cleantech

@CNBC l love President Barack Obama, fine job,thanks
@CNBC looks like it uses a lot of land
We should be happy with who we got now. Because we don't know who we will end up with. @BarackObama
follow the money. this is why you keep pushing the false climate change fear tactic. Traitor
Great news!
@jazzman1859 @CNBC Great Job Mr.  President
@CNBC Mr Obama you have been the best president ever!  We will miss you
don't break ur arm trying to pat urself on the back
But can we end off shore drilling, too? Please?
@CNBC 

Solar @ $60+ a MwH is foolish compared to Natural Gas @ $6 MwH and Nuclear @ $30 MwH.  Go green, but don't go stupid.
@CNBC @Mike_Halpern
yes we need clean energy ,and we need to make it affordable for all people to use it in the USA
@CNBC 
@CNBC The poor can't afford to put these in their home's, want get momentum from the poor
@Caroladevree @CNBC such a shame, Obama can't stay for another run....
@CNBC , I live near several of those solar farms in California. Thank you for supporting renewable energy!
@CNBC booooo
@CNBC good initiative
@CNBC What does Africa benefit from this.
Solar, like wind power is not dependable or efficient enough to power our country.  It is merely a liberal donor boondoggle.

@CNBC
Big payoff for your political contributors, huh?
Like solar? Go beyond lights onward to cooking and save lives in Africa @DFID_UK #FutureThink #SDG7
Obama,Snake Oil Sales Man,Selling Hillary.Working hard for a Political Criminal on Tax Payers $.Too bad U could'nt work for USA
@CNBC The leader of Isis & bokoharam your Boy's have killed 8 Christian students by Burning to death.
@CNBC Great ideas go with great thinkers. Why http://not.Solar  energy is God given for free let's use it.
@CNBC U.S. is on track to have over $20 trillion deficit by the time u r thru. Boondoggle solar projects are a big reason why.
How many solar panels are you going to buy with your 40 million book deal givings?
Sn baskan gelecek için ümit ışığı
İki yılda biraz zor görünüyor saygılar
@CNBC Congrats! Can we put a large installation on the island of Hawai'i? Electricity for a 2-story home is $800/month. -_-
thank you very much, President Obama; Carole Levrat 
@CNBC ادري بعد عمك دير بالك على العراق وساعده
@CNBC That is awesome!   Keep it coming
@CNBC ó

@CNBC can't wait for the study to come out on how this harnessed energy will give us all cancer!!
@CNBC what is the REAL return on investment,or j u st glitter in the sunshine 
@CNBC maybe one day I will be able to do solar in Texas.

@CNBC  U.S new project is very good
Great president.

@CNBC POTUS JUST KEEPS GETTING IT DONE
@CNBC Great work!! We have some small companies doing the same in S.A. Hospitals and shopping malls but we needs so much more.
wooooooow# u r great than our president ### ha ah ha
i'm not against, just worried.
it's really beautiful in theory. But what about the disposal of the batteries in the future? Is there a plan for that?
and it only took $14.3 trillion in stimulus and entitlement programs???
@CNBC . We will not see this condition but is investing in the person we love.
@CNBC  Capture sunlight long-term investing. One day just oil, gas is energy.
@CNBC @solarcity Huge step in fast implementation of green energy. Congrats!
Hi
@CNBC Great work. Pls get the vapor cigarette commercials off the tv.
can you help homeowners get solar impacted by decline with credit scores under 620? We want solar.
not in Oklahoma where @GovMaryFallin and the @officialOKGOP have increased taxes for using solar or renewal energy #oilcoowned
impersonate each other publicly and we'll be watching no time is better to replace only with hemp...you might agree about that.
1 good nuc power plant could replace all the blight these solar panels cause. stupid way to generate power.
@CNBC 
Any plan for d disposal of solar panels n its accessoriess? Refuse generated need a plan not to cause another problem.
u r the hero of USA ,my dream is to see u in America as a president

What's that like less than 1% of USA needs. Stupid ideas
Sure takes a lot of land for some to use solar.
@CNBC One word 'Solyndra'
@CNBC you know solar farms like these kill thousands of birds every year.

solindra??
how many do we need to replace our fossil based energy production capacity?
Big Deal. So why are all Electrical Bills going up? To pay for your despicable legacy. You're on your way out to the joy of all
What a moment!! Proud moment for each and everyone and this momentum will change the world.
@CNBC thanks to go Green Obama administration.
thanks for moving the USA ahead. I sure will miss you!!
.  Hey, Nice job with that Iran deal! Looks like it's paying dividends!  Jimmy Carter Jr. shall be your new name you dummy.
your solar movement has no movement in Nevada. Tell your buddy Harry Reid he got bought out by Nv energy
 all we can do Wind generating more power, Let's conserve, recycle and make the US as clean as Switzerland. Why not? 

why so they fry the birds above them? or put moneyin the zars of your pals. tick tock.
But saving our planet would be so much easier if you weren't owned by the fossil fuel industry, no?
very nice. great job president. Awesome USA. Number 01 Country in the world. Good!
@CNBC जबरदस्त पहल है प्रदूषण मुक्त एनर्जी जबरदस्त पहल है
#thematrix
But what about the possibility of conserving at least a bit of land by fitting buildings in major cities with solar panels?
@CNBC @SgyYogarajah More in accomplishing than political propaganda. It is the Greatness of President OBAMA .Deniers-- OBAMA ++
@CNBC looks like the emails are out with colin Powell to Hillary Clinton that' Hillary absolutely hats Barack Obama
我ストローいれてないでなや
@CNBC  Its big deal. Thanks USA for doing something to conserve nature
Our solar energy is abundant here but wasting. Just wasting but I hate it wasting
Solar energy is d answer to clean energy.
@CNBC 
Vote @DrJillStein as she would convert our energy 2 green by 2030
O won't stop a dirty oil pipe that will destroy water
@CNBC high technology
just be faithfull God will help you.
waste of money. Solar only survives if held up by govt $$$. Losing proposition, waste of $$$. Petrol is where it's at.
@CNBC bout time
Hello
What did you shoot today?
@CNBC good luck and it's nice step for the future ((clean energy ))
good job now can u send out another stimulus check for about 1500
before your outta office PLEASE SIR
@CNBC Obama, r u going to pardon @Snowden like a proper liberal in favor of transparent government,  especially when it lies?
I do NOT think snowden should be pardoned. He should be punished for being a traitor.
@CNBC what percentage of power utilation is that? Laughable
@CNBC except in north carolina our gov is making it hard to get
how's that? Go buy panels, govt. is glad to subsidize it...with taxpayer dollars. Solar is not efficient enuf.
That's great
@CNBC solar energy is best for us and environment. Utility companies  will block it to protect profits
@CNBC # what a great idea ! # xoxo !
Hey Prez !! NOW, CAN WE GET RID OF DIESEL TRUCKS AND VEHICLES WHO SPEW CARBONS INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE? XOXOXOX
Extensive fields of #SolarPanels What an eyesore?
Solar panel connect to bullet trail Rt @BarackObama the us is on track to hit two millions solar instalation @CNBC
The U.S is on track to kill innocent muslims and destroy there countries .but US fails and he will always
@CNBC @USAdarFarsi @UNOCHA @PhilipsHealth @fhollande @YouthArtConnect @JustinTrudeau

Nobody cares. The cost is still more than the financial savings. Only a liberal can see this as a win.  Please come quick 1-20
