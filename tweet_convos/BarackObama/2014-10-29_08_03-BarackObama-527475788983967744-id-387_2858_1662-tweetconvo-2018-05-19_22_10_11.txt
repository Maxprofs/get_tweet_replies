@BarackObama A fight you might win, come Tuesday maybe your only fight.
@BarackObama Dear Sir, climate change doesn't hurt the planet. The planet is billions years old. We are at risk, not the planet! Honesty!!

@BarackObama Climate Change is a Joke God is in Charge and he knows what he is doing, and you and your clowns use this lie to steal Money
@BarackObama
@BarackObama praise be to God to our president and his wife for walking walking diligently and working in the vineyard of peace
"@BarackObama: the fight against climate change can't wait."

Maybe that myth can be put on the back burner for ISIS, ebola, & the economy.
@hahaitsjoemama @BarackObama Ebola... lol. You're special.
.@Colgruv 3rd world virus that never should have made it here. Highly contagious. No cure yet. Causes gruesome, painful death. Need I go on?
@hahaitsjoemama You forgot the part about the only US Ebola death being the result of _gross_ negligence on the part of THPH.
@Colgruv onky death stateside SO FAR. Prevention is better than reaction.
@hahaitsjoemama So sending teams of soldiers and doctors to the site weeks ago to try and keep the virus contained is a reaction, then?
@Colgruv mix of prevention and reaction. More should be done to contain, such as quarantines.
@hahaitsjoemama Quarantines?! What a concept! Why didn't we think of that already? #OhWait

Wait - are you telling me that @BarackObama thinks he can stop hurricanes?
@CofWhite45 @BarackObama I think BO is the last to learn of his incompetence. So yes.
@BarackObama are we still remembering Katrina?
Too bad @BarackObama blew any climate change cred he had on clean coal, nuke power, Gulf spill & XL pipeline.  We could have used a leader.
