@BarackObama Knife crimes sometimes happen instead of guns in Japan. But at least mass murder would be decreased after banning guns.
@birdmini @BarackObama You couldn't stop people from building guns anyways. Then no one would have a gun to stop them
@swentkowski @BarackObama I think that's why all of this world should ban gun ownership.
@birdmini @BarackObama they should have serial numbers. If you sell it the number goes to their name. Illegal gun penalty stiff
@swentkowski @birdmini @BarackObama maybe you should learn more about firearms and law before commenting. Just a thought. Have a good day
@republicanarms @swentkowski @BarackObama At least, a gun won't be chosen as a birthday present.
@birdmini @swentkowski @BarackObama nothing wrong with a father gifting a son a firearm. It 's American tradition. If it is within the law.
@republicanarms @swentkowski @BarackObama What if the American culture killed people? I don't say anything if people want to keep theCulture
@BarackObama
The defense of war guns in US will have to be dealt with like the cult that it is. A cult coupled with paranoia. #Compassion
@RattDanQc @BarackObama WTH is a, "war gun"?
@republicanarms @BarackObama
An automatic weapon, a machine gun. No one uses them to hunt so what are they doing out there?
@RattDanQc @BarackObama Sir, automatic weapons r heavily regulated, only 1 has been used in a crime since 1934
@BarackObama
BTW please DON'T follow me Mr. Obama, you have much more important things to do. #Obvious
@BarackObama
