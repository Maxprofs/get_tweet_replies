@Medium good
@Medium - if Obama wants this Nominee, than We the People DON'T!
I know you have good intentions, but he's not the right to choice IMHO. Need a more a liberal judge to balance the court.
We can see YOU have your head buried SOMEPLACE - a more liberal court will FINISH destroying America!
I suppose that depends on your definition of destroy. I would be happy with just more moderate.
National Debt out of sight, Schools being forced to feed their kids 'garbage' - students needing 'safe havens' all bull!
Yes, and you can thank the last 2 administrations for that. Bush started it and Obama hasn't helped.
We keep hearing from liberals "Bush Started it" - How about Obama wasn't intelligent/smart enough to "stop it" - that work!
the BULL as you so eloquently.put it actually began with Reagan but I wouldn't want facts to mess up your temper tantrum.
Facts - EVERY time we have a DEMs in control everything turns to CRAP! More worried about social programs than country
