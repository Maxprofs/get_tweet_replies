Its. Judgment. MT @BarackObama: Reality has rendered it's judgement: Trickle-down economics does not work, and middle-class economics does.
@O2ron @BarackObama Judgement is correct.  It can be spelt both ways.
@Pietato @BarackObama
@MerriamWebster and careful writers in the US *strongly* prefer "judgment"
@O2ron @Pietato @BarackObama @MerriamWebster Careful writers also don't begin a sentence with the word "and".

@BarackObama ....and grassroots Economics REALLY works! Gandhi would agree.
@BarackObama It´s a ridiculous statement, or maybe all the White House cleaners have decent mortgages.
@BarackObama all very well but maybe a grammar check on the flying apostrophes before sending
@BarackObama  Idiocracy grips a nation when you name an economic ideal after the class in which it will destroy.
