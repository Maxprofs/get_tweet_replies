@BarackObama Why ppl mad thought? It's true! Ppl go 2 jail all the time and t/sentence almost never fits the crime...especially if ur black
@Martinique757 @BarackObama Ppl get sentenced harshly for things other than crime-disrespect the court, influential victim, mad prosecutor
@Martinique757 @BarackObama I've been 2 prison. Seen black/white men get easy time, some get hard time-small counties most harsh.  Unfair.
@BarackObama You are right ,if you kill someone, they should not get probation. In memory of Justin Thomas Quintana May 16th 2014

@BarackObama True. So when will you and @HillaryClinton be punished for YOUR crimes?
@BarackObama yes thank you! Finally someone says it
@BarackObama ;Evey body makes mistakes; Everyone deserves a Second Chance; Jesus Died and gave Mankind a Second Chance.
@BarackObama I’d like to hire Zeus to thunder-strike heartless politicians, to make their deaths seem natural.

Thank you very much.
@BarackObama Then the punishment for your crimes will be...

What a  let down
@BarackObama Yes, it should. So why isn't @onetoughnerd (Rick Snyder) on death row? #AmericanGenocide
@BarackObama @washingtonpost what about your crimes of #treason
@BarackObama @washingtonpost We should make sure that we have to get the punishment if we did wrong thing and we should fit in that system.
@BarackObama I agree. If you murder, you should be executed. If you steal you should pay the price( monetary, legal costs, etc) if you rape?
@BarackObama leer a Loic Wacquant - Parías Urbanos y Cárceles de la Miseria. La súper criminalización destruye la democracia, mire a #Suecia
@BarackObama las policías y la justicia asesinan muchas más personas que todos los asesinos de US. Quien los juzga?
@BarackObama @washingtonpost correct and this thought should be applied in every single country
@BarackObama good lets start with you.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost I support solutions that create strengthing the human spirit!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost I wish you can serve at least four more years, I don't know how we will survive without you.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost I think Obama is a criminal and he will get away with it because he is above the law
@BarackObama @washingtonpost the high level of the justice
@BarackObama @washingtonpost.   If people don't want to do the time, then they shouldn't do the crime!!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost 
@BarackObama If the punishment should fit the crime what do YOU and your failed administration deserve for your crimes against Americans?
@BarackObama yes for example #Hillary2016 should be found guilty of treason and you should be #impeached
@BarackObama agreed
@BarackObama  당신 책임도 크다는 사실을 잊지 마세요. 상징적으로 하루 정도 교도소 생활을 해보는 것은 어떨지...(From friend)
@BarackObama then why are you allowing Hillary to walk free?
@BarackObama

@BarackObama It's a failed system. Solitary confinement only results in producing hard core convicts with no future once the get out.
@BarackObama @washingtonpost @cityofchandler    come down here to tell the courts

@BarackObama @washingtonpost. I have so many ideas I think would be great for our epidemic. Ty for taking this on. I believe wecando wonders
@BarackObama totally agree… I can't remember what the punishment is for treason, but I hope you apply this to yourself also… ;-)
@BarackObama @washingtonpost причем все это поддерживается тем самым президентом, который и высказывается
@BarackObama @washingtonpost судебная система США оставляет желать лучшего, однако система назначения наказания говорит о негуманности

@BarackObama YOU'RE RIGHT! What should be the punishment for stealing $2.7 trillion SS money?
@BarackObama xactly
@BarackObama Victims do not get that opportunity and many times never get over the trauma. Who should pay the price for that?

@BarackObama ЧИТАЙ ПО ГУБАМ: НАМ ПО-ХУЙ НА САНК-ЦИ-И
@BarackObama. Ialso hope you remember sentencing when HRC is found guilty!
@BarackObama Then why do leave known murderers, heroin dealers,and ILLEGAL ALIENS out of prison?  Also enforce federal law round up ILLEGALS
@BarackObama no rethinking necessary. Abolish. Why punish at all? Teach, heal, protect. "Justice" is a euphemism for Revenge. Eye for an eye
@BarackObama @washingtonpost who's going to prison for the Flint Michigan disaster? Public shaming of the State government  isn't enough
@BarackObama @washingtonpost مجرم يحاسب نفسه على ما يفعل في سوريا وفلسطين ترك الشعب السوري لمصيره وأرسل المجرمين الروس يقتل الشعب السوري
@BarackObama Shorter sentences and paid work in the community for those convicted. Will reinforce self worth and improve the community.
@BarackObama That makes good sense.
@BarackObama #Right sir!!!!!
@BarackObama I guess that is your justification for giving a criminal $10mm as part of Iran prisoner release? #ObamaNegotiatesWithTerrorists

@BarackObama
Now that we have cellphones, we can legally limit police power of arrest to cases of 9-11 phone call response, banning patrols.

@BarackObama Being world's strongest prsdnt y don't u tk action against Pak which produce terrorists while running campaign agnst terrorism?

@BarackObama wallstreet enough said!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost  that didn't hold true for the Bankers and Wall Streeters that got filthy rich on the backs of We The People!!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost l am one of them, except I was fone in by the USDA Rural Development program.
@BarackObama That puts you in the cross hairs then!!!
@BarackObama Meri US ticket paki ?
@BarackObama ok. Here's the deal. You agree to solitary confinement for the rest of your life, we will spare the rapists and murderers.
@BarackObama yeah... That's why data piracy and pretty crime get decades while rapists, murderers and financial crooks get months or years!
@BarackObama @washingtonpost So correct, sir. Our criminal justice system needs to be honored in a better life time. More is needed.
@BarackObama  think that's what Americans r saying...r u listening?
