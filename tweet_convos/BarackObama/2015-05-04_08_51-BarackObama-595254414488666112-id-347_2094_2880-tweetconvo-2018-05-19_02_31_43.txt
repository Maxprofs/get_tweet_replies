.@barackobama Can someone PLEASE show me a poll of EVERY climate scientist where 97% of them support majority human warming? @bayer4crops
@GalileoMovement Really? This is pretty undisputed. Here's the study that states that 97,1 % agree. http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article …
@Bayer4Crops You have linked a paper that that has been rebutted by peer review and is not a survey of climate scientists anyway.
@GalileoMovement We linked a paper that you asked us to link (and it's valid). And there are plenty of other studies that leave no doubt.
@Bayer4Crops The studies has nothing to do with climate scientists
Only 0.3% of papers analysed dealt with AGW hypothesis. Sorry, try again?
@GalileoMovement Please stop this nonsense. http://www.ipcc.ch/  – http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/  – End of discussion.
@Bayer4Crops You have changed the topic. There is no survey of climate scientists on whether they support majority of warming from humans
@BarackObama You are the dangerous one !!!!
