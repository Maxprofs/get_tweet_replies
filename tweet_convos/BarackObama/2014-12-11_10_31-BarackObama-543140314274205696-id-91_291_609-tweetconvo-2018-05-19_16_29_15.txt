@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama - as long as one is willing to deal with inefficiencies in socialist healthcare , you'll be set.
@ElizabethBanks yes 4 days to buy a product or face a fine err tax.  The IRS has no business in healthcare.
@ElizabethBanks @BarackObama Shes a big fan of socialized medicine, so sad.
@ElizabethBanks my insurance premiums decreased by 50% with lower deductibles, copycats. If not yours, your employer is keeping the savings.
