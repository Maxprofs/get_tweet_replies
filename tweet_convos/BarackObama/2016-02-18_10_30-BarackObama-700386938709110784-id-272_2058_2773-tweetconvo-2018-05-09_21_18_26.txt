.@barackobama Agree. This is so much more immoral than taking the life of humans who will never live to feel the effects of global warming.
@BarackObama So, the weather of one month proves climate change? Laughable.
@BarackObama @MichelleObama 
Obama will end his presidency period and his hands stained with #Yemeni bloods.
#BarackObama participated in killing civilians in #Yemen by supporting #Saudi on the war. #Nobel peace prize should withdraw from him.

@BarackObama @Slate : Just how you feel when a rape happens.

@BarackObama @EricHolthaus Great, someone call Bill Nye The Fake Science Guy!
@BarackObama No, it's just meteorologists' conspiracy to scare us, in payback for when we'd blame them for bad weather as if they caused it.
@BarackObama @EricHolthaus I guess it is time to talk about the meat production and starting thinking of an alternative?
@BarackObama  yet last two years I froze my ass off. U dummy, nature changes all the time. Get China, and India on board, then get back 2 me
