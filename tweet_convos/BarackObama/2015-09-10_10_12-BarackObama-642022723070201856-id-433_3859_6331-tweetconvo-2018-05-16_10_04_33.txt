@BarackObama Thank you for all you have done and continue to do. There has never been a greater President
RT @BarackObama: "I want two years of college to be as free and universal as high school is today." —President Obama
@BarackObama Rare, first of its kind and great thought of the President that first two years free education in the Colleges.
@BarackObama It is done in Trinidad and Tobago, though small can be used as a model. Free education all the way
@BarackObama umm. Don't we pay taxes for public skools? Only free for the illegal aliens
@BarackObama that means more spending we as a country don't have the money Stop spending like this country has it
@BarackObama maybe all of the Saudi king and Royal family's of the world could help us &send people to college for free who don't want work?
@BarackObama3GenerationsOC #CommunityCollege together
Mother/Daughter A.A.Degrees Granddaughter Child Dev.Cntr
@BarackObama So, you want ME to pay for it?  #SocialismDoesntWork You are such a moron.
@BarackObama @APPropst How much would taxes have to change in order contribute to two years of free community college?
@BarackObama @Oshianna2U pull out the stops and advocate four years plus medicare for all. Do it in spite of your corporate masters. Legacy.
@BarackObama It is a Great Plan.

@BarackObama education free for all at all levels barack

@BarackObama we all want everything free but it doesn't work that way
@BarackObama make it happen! the only way to a better society is a better educated society
@BarackObama, we'll not gonna survive with out him period!
@BarackObama @Oshianna2U care less about oil and more about education. As Europe does.
@BarackObama if all African presidents like you thought Africa would be developed.
@BarackObama @BernieSanders #FreeAssociatesDegree is a good start. but how about all #StateUniversity should be #free.
#DeadSerious #Student
@doveraudio @BarackObama @BernieSanders Education on the internet is free! Don’t ever stop learning! http://www.npiamerica.org/research/category/what-the-founders-really-thought-about-race …
@BarackObama NOT!
@BarackObama ¿Only two? An efficient State should provide excellent education as in many countries of the world.
@Piren_ @BarackObama then move to those countries. Nothing is ever free, some one has to pay. Take from some to give to others.
@jgarcia3 @BarackObama If someone always pays, then pay the State with money from our taxes. So everyone would have quality education.
@Piren_ @jgarcia3 well in saudi arabia universities r free and we dont have taxes  so pretty sure us can do it
@BarackObama Free college would be great, but first you have to convince today's youth that it is worth learning.
@BarackObama  .  Who is going to pay for an education and they can't find work. The middle class like always.
@BarackObama this idea makes a lot of good sense
@BarackObama рубашка стрёмная
@BarackObama 
Off thankx.
@BarackObama therre's that word again, FREE... for who? How much does it cost the rest of us?
@BarackObama one of the best ideas you have had. Bravo.:-)
@BarackObama
 I absolutely agree ALL children must be educated thru 4 yr college degree.
@BarackObama make sure industry involvement is stable with mandatory job placement programs for 3year+ collage students too for experience.
#HearUs.@BarackObama you've turned blind eye to #1in68AUTISM. Who pays for AUTISTIC ADULTS?  #CDCwhistleblower>

@aspiesmom @BarackObama Adults get no care and are winding up in prison with Our Mentally Ill. We spend $$ on early interventions for this?
@BarackObama we are buried in debt. Pay it down and then tell us your wonderful plans for free everything

@BarackObama American's forgot what Progress looks like...-(
@BarackObama and the American People want you Out of Our White House...No More Change !
@BarackObama High school is not free and you cant make college free - Someone pays. Your free ride rhetoric take away ambition
@BarackObama @rbaker65708, I want a 4 year Collage education to be free to all Americans at public universities. We have no excuse not to.
@BarackObama High School is not free...tax payers pay for it. College is not mandatory so it does not come from taxes...say 'no' to freebies
@BarackObama enjoying champ cash and earn $ 10 daily. Download it from play store mine sponsors id is 129609. And earn $1 instantly :-)
@BarackObama HS isn't free, we pay for it. What you want are freeloaders in our community colleges, as if there are not enough of them now.
@barackobama @eaglefeather43 America needs to realize we need to 'educate' our citizens to keep our country strong, NOT arm them.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I dont think you know what free means...and my public high school was not even close to free.

@BarackObama http://autolot.blogspot.com 
@BarackObama http://fashnoct.blogspot.com 
@BarackObama It's never 'free' - has to be paid for by somebody through MORE TAXES.
@BarackObama http://facebooklot.blogspot.com 
@BarackObama Wonderful. More handouts for non-taxpaying citizens. I'm sick of supporting people that refuse to help themselves.
@BarackObama  Netflix insiders and Goldman Sachs scam gang looted $10's of billions since 2010. SEC & Eric Holder arrested me instead

@BarackObama @jteberhard 
Funny, I want 4. AND for those of us who can learn faster than most to get an option to go self paced
@BarackObama Well...the American people want a president who doesn't support terrorism.  I guess we can't always get what we want.
@BarackObama   This is awesome..
@BarackObama ok but when Is this going to happen? Last thing i want isto pay them as soon as I get my degree it's free. Not fair
@BarackObama vc foi escolhido por DEUS pra fala pra nós brancos,q somos todos iguais em espírito,até os animais tem serventia aqui na terra.
@BarackObama So can we who paid for at least two years already get that money back?

@BarackObama free as in Obamacare free?

Will professors work for free?
@BarackObama hello sir you are the best! Good morning have a nice day from india
@BarackObama That's a real motivation for people to go a blessing for all that can't afford to pay. Will make a difference in a lot of lives
@BarackObama This country is so fucked up everything should be free.  Hell @GrimsToyShow wants his WWE wrestling figures for free.
@BarackObama @my president

@BarackObama that's good
@BarackObama who's going to pay for it? China?
@BarackObama  If something like this happens in economically troubled countries, it will make whole world a better place.
@BarackObama Great Idea Mr President!
@BarackObama Cue the outrage on the right talking about low wage jobs knowing they have zero policies to change that unlike this.
@BarackObama Even if they are not QUALIFIED via GRADES TO GO TO COLLEGE ???
@BarackObama it was also be much harder for college graduates to find jobs
@BarackObama Y, what do they teach at college that will hold students in good stead in the future??
@BarackObama Community college is nearly free for low-income people, you neglect the middle class
@BarackObama Time. #10;20pm Motion. #Active
@BarackObama, may God bless you Mr.President & we are blessed to have ur leadership when we needed most.
@BarackObama "Free?"
@BarackObama  Umm, no, public education in PA is funded by property taxes. Not free. Averages $2,500/yr. in SE PA
@BarackObama Is that for everyone or just for kids? I'd be all over that in minutes.
Talk about being out of freaking touch. Parents how "free" is your kids high school? @BarackObama you're such a tool.
@BarackObama  99.999999 % of high school kids cant spell collage. But hey you give illegals free shit so why not stupid Americans.
@BarackObama bizde özgür olmak istiyoruz düş yakamızdan amerika  dürüstçe savaşsanız allahına kadar varız ama kalleşçe savaşınızda
@BarackObama not if it costs tax payers. Stop forcing us to pay for free shit for everyone else.
Dear @barackobama No US Entry  to Ba Ba Black Sheep #10ClassPM @narendramodi.#PoliticsOfAbuse @shashitharoor #ModiMad
@BarackObama Why not 4 years of free college like Israel gives their citizens will 11 million a day of OUR tax dollars!?!   Shame on you!
@BarackObama high school is not free.
@BarackObama  Many don't even finish high school. High school graduation must be required in 21st Century, students must prepare for college
@BarackObama who will pay for it? Paying debt with debt is not sustainable.
@BarackObama @lissie_jeannine Great example of your road to success.  Proud of you sweetheart. Hope your sis can understand this as well.

@BarackObama

@BarackObama this sounds like a great idea on paper, but the minute you implement this, a degree will be worth nothing since everyone has it
@BarackObama by the way, high school is not free here! We pay tons of mandatory fees and now they ask need donations 4 classroom supplies!
@BarackObama somebody will have to pay for it! Probably the overtaxed middle class. #StopobamasSpinDoctoring

@BarackObama @MAHAMOSA 1st world countries make it 4 years. Bernie Sanders is proposing 4 years
@BarackObama First Obama promises free health care now free college. But Scott Walker didn't need College, and look at him now.
@barackobama  whoa  that nice
@BarackObama High school is free? You are severely out of touch. I pay school taxes! You give my tax dollars to Iran!
@BarackObama I love it when progressive leftist use "free".  It's like a kid with a check book, "how can I be broke, I still got checks?"
@BarackObama yes
@BarackObama @MAHAMOSA 
@BarackObama I love this idea,  but how will we pay for it?
@BarackObama I would have been born in the US... 've been there more than 10 times. I LOVE the country, the people and you, dear president!

@BarackObama Nothing is free. Result either more debt or higher taxes. Why tuition hikes r so far above inflation rate is the real issue.
@BarackObama тот ужас который происходит сейчас с беженцами в Европе, это последствия военных преступлений США на Ближнем востоке
@BarackObama making college free would devalue the hard work of those who try to get scholarships
