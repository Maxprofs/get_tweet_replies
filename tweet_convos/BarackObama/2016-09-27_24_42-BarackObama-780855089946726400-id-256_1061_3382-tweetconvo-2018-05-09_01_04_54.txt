@PatcohenNYT liar liar . Move your wife and daughters to inner cities than tweet 
@nytimes f**k
@nytimes Just because you lie and create these numbers does not make it so. Come tell the working class this
@nytimes Where are you getting this info??
@nytimes Lies!
@nytimes non of these numbers are real.it's like removing 95 million from workforce and stating that unemployment is only 4.7%.
@PatcohenNYT Ignore Labor force participation to keep a dependent lower class heads just above poverty?
@nytimes
@nytimes we appreciate you
@nytimes then why is the GDP still shit and why hasn't the Fed raised interest rates?
kindly assist boost household incomes all over the world especially African countries poverty levels are high.
@nytimes The racist will never acknowledge. Deplorable.
How pleasant life it would be if people with money could use it in such a way that people without money could use it.
become americans, wages still the same but good for others to have a job and get out of poverty and economy is improving
Correct and those who's asking about your status if you are a citizen or not let them admit where are they from and how they be
For the households that didn't give up.   Yes it's true.  How about the ones that just decided there is no work?
BRAVO I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT IS WORKING IN THIS PROFESSION
another Obama lie! While everything around me has gone up, groceries, cable, energy etc. I make less now than 5 years ago.
@PatcohenNYT Define poverty-is one 'out of povt' when they make 14.5k/yr? Can't live off that
@nytimes meanwhile the people who are on Social security are starving to death and increasingly among the homeless.
yes
No need 2 lie both parties have been (messing up); no doubt it's the acts of the GOP, but the silence is too damn silent DEMS.
U DEMS need 2 explain the GOP obstruction effect, obstructing jobs & immigration. Why r u DEMS so slow on this matter?
DEMS need 2 let the American ppl know, just how GOP obstruction is holding back the 1st & secondary job markets. NOW DEMS!
True, but it could b better, if the GOP were not obstructing infrastructure jobs & immigration supplying secondary market jobs.
@nytimes More Barack success - Thank you,  Sir!
From a President who keeps working hard making improvements all the time.  We must keep moving forward by supporting Clinton!
@nytimeनमस्ते
@nytimes does this include the rate of homelessness that goes unreported? Oh wait... nope 🖓 #seattlebridges #newyorkstreets
5yrs ago my Social Security purchased goods---now I can't fly to see my Grandchildren!  Cost 3x higher--i exist, NO$$ to go out
The @GOP has held the House & Senate since 1/3/2015.
It's no surprise that 2015 was a good year.
Still…
