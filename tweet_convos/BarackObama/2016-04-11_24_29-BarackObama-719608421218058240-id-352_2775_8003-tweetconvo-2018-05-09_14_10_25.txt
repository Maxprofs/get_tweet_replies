@BarackObama It's so ironic that YOU use the word dysfunction... LOL!
@BarackObama you must seriously question a democratic government that prefers gridlock to function.
@BarackObama but if they vote on your nominee (which you say is all you're asking) and vote no, it's still 4-4. It sounds like you (cont.)
@BarackObama don't just want a vote, but that you want your nominee to be rubber-stamped.
@BarackObama

@BarackObama @0045Modou
@BarackObama it doesn't matter if its 4-4, 5-3 or 6-2. Nine justices are what is needed. The Senate should do its job and hold the hearings.
@BarackObama you mean like you did to Bush when you were in the Senate
@BarackObama agreed, as a disabled Combat Veteran I want to thank you so much for the job you have done, with so much wisdom and class. Jim

@BarackObama It is mandatory for the health of our nation that gridlock and dysfunction spread to the Supreme court.
@BarackObama: Which is exactly why the Senate has voted down one political hack, appointed by another political hack.
@BarackObama If the radical liberals on the court ever stopped deciding based on Dem talking points, this would not be an issue.
