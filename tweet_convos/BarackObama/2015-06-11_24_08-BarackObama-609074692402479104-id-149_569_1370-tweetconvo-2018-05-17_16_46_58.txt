@BarackObama But college is not vital to Scott Walker. Shortsighted.
@PeterdiPierro You can be a dangerous moron with or without a college degree.
@RobinDotNet I'll take uneducated over progressive lib tyranny. Be well.
@PeterdiPierro We'll just agree to disagree on that. I believe in helping people, and the Rep's aren't keen about that.
@RobinDotNet help up yes, welfare dependency No... There would be no Progressives without a dependent underclass they create.
@PeterdiPierro There are a lot of poor people in this country using the foodbanks. Fraud is 2%. (Unlike disability, much higher.)
@RobinDotNet Not taking about fraud. Look at Oakland or Baltimore ect.. Stop listening to Pelosi and Fienstein .. Yes help the needy.
Barack Obamaさん

Expanding Opportunity is vital to success

Thank you very much!!

@BarackObama
@BarackObama For Deserving Students? What if I want to study founding fathers conservatism constitutional law. #CollegeOpportunity
@BarackObama Fact: Getting Government out of tuition guarantee Biz will drastically lower costs. Econ 101. #CollegeOpportunity
@BarackObama if college tuition is a bond fire, federal funding is the gasoline. Stop! You're not helping!
@BarackObama If we don't convince the uneducated that school is how to be productive, then who will water the trees on the money farm?
@BarackObama  you are the best! Your plain went over my house in palm springs Sunday .like I saying you are the best we all love you!
@BarackObama NO MORE JOBS AT THE COUNTRY !!!!
@BarackObama Google the Ten Worst Academic Colleges in America and check out the "college investment", dollars are a terrible thing to waste
@BarackObama Good evening Mr President. I come from Miami, Florida. I  want to communicate via twitter.May I respectfully ask 4 a reply?
@BarackObama yes by all means go to college you might get a part time job with no benefits
@BarackObama Invest funds in those likely to succeed: college jrs and srs. Ask for community service as part of the bargain.
@BarackObama  Taxpayers always end up footing the bill for those who don't even belong in college! Colleges letting in drug dealers by me!
@BarackObama here, here education is the key
@BarackObama hi barack obama hows your day going
@BarackObama The economic expansion should be based on well-being. The economy must serve man and not vice versa.
@BarackObama I believe making College affordable is so important. Families shouldn't have to struggle to send their children to college.
@BarackObama Nothing is free. #WakeUpAmerica #ObamaLies
@BarackObama you continue to say stupid things.

@BarackObama thanks for sharing Barack Obama, have a great Monday :) (insight by http://commun.it )
@BarackObama My name is Marilou. I honestly need your help.
@BarackObama I'm in college, but can't afford to buy super smash bros so I'm debating throwing in the towel and saving $10k+ next year.
@BarackObama I think this is a great idea  
@BarackObama stop mounting school debt. Most skilled trades people w/o degrees know more than than many who have them but are paid more.
@BarackObama I think it is a great idea especially for so many as a bridge of transition and opportunity to a 4 year college.
@barackobama global economy for MNCs; global ecology for all humanity & mute biodiversity;  need good choice
@BarackObama Why this much Vechile Convey for Presidential trip national waste President is protected by Love &believes of People not by Gun
@BarackObama love the idea of free or low cost community college for all, & don't support tax dollars available to for profit schools.
@BarackObama Sir,College Opportunity at reasonable cost is very important for any countries success,India also.For my daughters too.RGDS
@BarackObama ...and maybe throw some student loan debt forgiveness in there? Lol
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama I was required to move out if USA as my H4 visa holder daughter treated as international student!
@BarackObama But you said it was you who is vital to America's global economy. But I say you are vital to our downfall. so go away
“@BarackObama: Expanding #CollegeOpportunity is vital to America's success in a global economy: http://ofa.bo/t7m5 ”
@BarackObama yeah nwo :(
@BarackObama Sorry, Mr. President, but it's a fact.
@BarackObama I always thought community colleges were already free of charge. What's needed is financial help for a 4-year education.
@BarackObama what about four year universities?  Do those students not get help paying off their loans?
@BarackObama follow me plz 
@BarackObama https://www.youcaring.com/india-stallworth-watson-367491#.VXi508eN7M8.email … PLEASE HELP MY SISTER GET TO UNIVERSITY!!

@BarackObama Buenas tardes Señor Presidente nuestro país HONDURAS lo necesita, ya no aguantamos la corrupción y la impunidad.

Education is an eye to the world,ability to distinguish between right n wrong, moderate n extremist.At least 2 yrs clg be free
More vital to our economy than expanding #CollegeOpportunity on the backs of taxpayers, @BarackObama, would be if you improved your economy
