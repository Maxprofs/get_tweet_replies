@jlangdale @BarackObama Yes, but I think he wants to even the worldwide playing field and send money overseas, to repent for past US sins.

@BarackObama i wonder the ones who hinders the minimum wage increase proposal pass know the price of a gallon of milk.
@BarackObama problem with raising minimum wage is that small businesses will go out of business!
