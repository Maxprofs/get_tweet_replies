@BarackObama @smoshanthony There's nothing you can do about
@BarackObama @smoshanthony well people will find a way to get guns one way or another...
@kenziekat1220 @BarackObama people find ways to do lots of illegal things but it's deterred to a much higher degree when there are laws
@smoshanthony @BarackObama well still it just makes it harder for people that actually need them to stay safe.
@kenziekat1220 @BarackObama most times people need a gun to stay safe from other people with guns. Violence feeds violence.
@smoshanthony @BarackObama Good point but sadly gun violence will probably never
@smoshanthony @BarackObama will probably never end*
@kenziekat1220 @BarackObama that doesn't mean we can't try to prevent it :)

@Zachary_Mark  big population difference plus what other violent per capita also if I shoot an intruder that a good shooting
.@BarackObama yes, they should be doing something about the cause -> linked to pumping our kids full of violence-inducing #SSRIs
@mihotep @BarackObama that's literally the exact opposite effect of an ssri...
@Zachary_Mark @BarackObama is it now? #SSRIs and youth (<25) don't mix well
@BarackObama educate our children bettr, teach accountability and not blame culture, guns dont kill, people kill people

@BarackObama This Country Needs Bad Guys And Manufactured Criminals For Minority Control and Profits For Those That Houses Them.
@BarackObama White America Is Preparing For War Foreign And Democratic Realizing The Consequences Of Purposely Dividing The Country.

@BarackObama if you cant get the congress to work how are we going to get them to work except voting them out?
@BarackObama Guns are far more dangerous than cars & nowhere near as useful. SO... a gun registry, & licenses to operate that can be revoked
@BarackObama There a millions of cars in America. They are all Registered and to drive one, folks must PROVE they can drive & get a license
@BarackObama TAKE A STAND AGAINST GANG VIOLENCE, BETTER DOCUMENTATION ON MENTALLY ILL. THE GUNS DO NOT SHOOT THERE SELF'S.

@BarackObama We should be putting in jail irresponsible gun owning parents.
@BarackObama Fuck no! Take a stand against gun free zones.
@BarackObama Let's ban Special Ed students and those with thought and mood disorders from buying guns. Why punish law abiding citizens?
@BarackObama Drug dealing, open borders, drug cartels and gang wars cause 96% of gun deaths. What's in it for you?
@BarackObama arm the teachers, provide security personnel with guns, like you have a president, also open your mind
@BarackObama since when did you need congress?  You normally just use executive power don't you?
@BarackObama Mr. President. I believe we meant to elect your campaign speech writer for the presidency, not you. #doover ?
@BarackObama Yes We Can #Do Something.

@BarackObama yes it's time to teach gun safety and care of life like in the 50s  more laws are stupid as proven from 1985 forward
@BarackObama yeah starting with you.  I think the next legislation concerning this should also remove you from office.
