@TSalommy @WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Prez Obama, I apologize for the uncouth comment from @TSalommy. He/it has no CLASS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Health insurance is a joke. If I have to pay $thousands in copays/deductables all year I'm still going broke.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @CarlyFiorina Many can't afford premiums & co-pay. Obama is a liar. ACA was a series of bad insider deals.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS I concur with POTUS on this point.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS , a man who can well understand women....a RARE GIFT!

@WhiteHouse @POTUS girl you should have asked.  What right do you have to force people to choose?! Obama ain't God. He has no right!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS True,  but you shouldn't have to pay $600 a month or even a quarter, especially if you aren't workng.

@WhiteHouse if before @BarackObama was @POTUS he was forced to get insured or pay tax penalty, what would he have done? #YouTubeAsksObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS in order to get health insurance, i had to get a lower paying hard labor job. #YouTubeAsksObama
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 
These statements sounds good, but who determines who "should" have what, and at whose cost?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Coverage, hopefully by Monday. If everything works out, we shall go farther. Thank you
@WhiteHouse @POTUS can you ask him to save the Yemeni children being killed by American jets and weapons with his blessings, it's a genocide
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS  I intend to hire heartless politicians to clean humans’ bathtubs from dead skin.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Everyone SHOULD have? More like everyone MUST have...or get fined.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I’d like to pay annoying clowns, to throw sand on the face of heartless politicians, whenever there is a rainbow.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS What if u can't afford through work,your state won't expand Med. and ur inelligible  for tax credit like me?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Why has Obamacare caused health insurance premiums to skyrocket? Why can't ppl keep own MD, own plan?
"2011 I Reported Medical Abuse done to Me @VANewMexico to @WhiteHouse @POTUS.#VA Swept Under Rug&Retaliated thru My #HealthCare &VA Claims."
@WhiteHouse @POTUS a lot of small businesses can't afford to cover their employees, like the job I was laid off from
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS hello Mr OBAMA, it will be great if MR mumia abu Jamal becomes a free Citizen because he isn't guilty

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Sans bec ni ongles !
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it doesn't work that way
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Better perhaps if you don't get sick in the first place. Isn't it?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Only because Obama will fine you even if you cant afford to use cause of very high deductibles Or else IRS will get you

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS 
@WhiteHouse @cscstars @POTUS But Ins. Co's still raise prices every year on private accounts, reduce benefit network services #singlepayer
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS We pay too much in taxes and receive nothing. Healthcare should be paid by state and federal governments.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS health care is garbage. ..it only covers certain things...its a scheme
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS Pay rent/bills, or get health insurance. I can't afford it yuh mook. So I've paid fines for 3 yrs. Freedom?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS (*￣ー￣)パッケージって、言ってた
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @BarackObama I hate to be 'that guy', but do you realize the average American will not understand out of context?
@C0ffeePlays as much as I hate the fact of it; most americans will find you blaming them for not having health care.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS My son is covered under MEDICAL but goes to school in OKLAHOMA where it's no good to him. #hole_in_ACA
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Peolpe can't afford premiums. It's cheaper to pay the penalty. Duh.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS you'll have to work two jobs to pay deductibles
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS that's what I am talking about
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @POTUS IT'S NOT LIKE PEOPLE DONT WANT INSURANCE.  THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ALLOWS THIS?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama saludos desde cilombia att ALBEIRO
It'd help immensely if you presided over a positive economy that created jobs, replacing the need for taxpayer funded hc @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS this is a basic Aussie right, and you guys are suppose to be a first world country and yet you can't work this one out
@AmaratTamara @WhiteHouse @POTUS We can't work it out because the citizens are so brainwashed into thinking this is socialism. SMH
@WhiteHouse @POTUS if can afford for pay for it
@WhiteHouse @POTUS It should be your choice to pick from competitors. U shouldn't be mandated to buy anything. Catastrophic s/b option.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS It's NOT affordable. Health Care Reform should go well beyond the premium and deductibles. Do something about the greed.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS what if you don't want it?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS help me please
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Obamacare/ACA is a MESS, misrepresented AKA: FRAUD. The LAW is a FRAUD due to the misrepresentation.Compounded HealthMESS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Yeah, but the #ACA options weren't affordable either! I make too much for #Medicaid but not enough for other options...
@WhiteHouse @POTUS ,is it ok to push through a law with 51 votes? When most of country doesn't want it and still doesn't.
Potus is a liar. .
@WhiteHouse @POTUS So every job now warrants the employer to provide health insurance? Unbelievable.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Για τον κ. Ομπάμα σαν καλός Πρόεδρος που είναι , αυτό που τον ενδιαφέρει είναι κάθε πολίτης να έχει βιβλιάριο Υγείας
@WhiteHouse @POTUS In the long run it will be like with the S S less benefit
@WhiteHouse @POTUS but the premium  is so high
@WhiteHouse @POTUS That was an enlightening interview on YOUTUBE.  The interviewers represent the new electorate.  It gives me hope!!!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS U still haven't figured out having health insurance DOESN"T equal having health care. 4 many ACA Premiums etc are 2 high
@WhiteHouse @POTUS and can't pay for it then they lose healthcare coverage anyways. Even if they paid for it for 10 years straight before.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Obamacare is running small businesses into the ground. Students can't afford it either.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS 
No kidding joker.
Its illegal now.
A fineable offense, enforced by IRS.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  ...  I DON'T HAVE COVERAGE and I have a laundry list of chronic illnesses. Just waiting for one of them to KILL ME.
@TheLeftWingCafe if we had a single payer option like @SenSanders is proposing, you'd be covered. #FeelTheBern
@WhiteHouse @POTUS people lose everything they have even with insurance. You don't seem to understand that when they get into an accident,
@WhiteHouse @POTUS absolutely correct
