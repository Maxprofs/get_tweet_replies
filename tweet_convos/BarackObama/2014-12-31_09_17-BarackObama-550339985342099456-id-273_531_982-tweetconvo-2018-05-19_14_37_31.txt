@BarackObama so you're going to execute gang members? Its the only way to stop the gun violence problem. Look at chicago
Light up the TILT RT @railgirl1952: @BarackObama LOL you and @OFA are COMMUNIST LOW LIFE SCUM!
@alizinaty @BarackObama @UN gg
@BarackObama please don't follow me.
Why are murders through the roof in Chicago and DC if gun free zones and gun control is the answer? #2A #gunGrabber =>> @BarackObama
@JoeC1776 Chicago certainly isn't a "gun-free zone". Concealed carry is legal in Chicago.
@BarackObama Ha you Have the right to see the movie first to make the violence no guns best rghs Happy new year
@BarackObama cc
@BarackObama How much longer?
@BarackObama fOLLOW MEE!!!
@DwiSeftian1 @BarackObama CAPS LOCK
@gavindennett @BarackObama YESS! It's better than screaming hha
@BarackObama @OFA
@BarackObama Jail black police haters for killing cops. Blacks kill Blacks more often than a white killing blacks.Obama is 1/2breed nt blk
@BarackObama there is  a Wild West mentality in this country that will never give up their guns.
@barackobama
@BarackObama Let's give a peace chance freedom and democrats
@BarackObama Winning, eh? Y'all have been into Charlie Sheen's Tiger Blood stash, haven't you?
@BarackObama Idiots. There are more and more people FOR gun ownership than against. But you keep inside that fantasy world of yours
“@BarackObama: grassroots mkg progress in fight 2reduce gun violence: http://ofa.bo/d24A ” BS bad CHOICES, one-parent hshlds cause crime.
@BarackObama why
@BarackObama Explain exactly, specifically, how expanding background checks on legal gun purchases stop criminals/crimes?
@BarackObama When everybody is working,less time for violence. Free market creates prosperity & many opportunities to become middle class.
@BarackObama Did that work in Chicago?
@BarackObama Reality continues to elude you doesnt it!
@BarackObama More BS from Odumbo!
@BarackObama @OFA Someone in power needs to be brave enough to want to change the US constitutional right to bear arms.
@BarackObama How's that working in Chicago? Oh. Never mind.
@BarackObama where's the diversity? Looking all AA from here. Shunning whites? Asians? Hispanics? Shame shame.
@BarackObama I need your help if you can help me to get a job to earns a big money
@BarackObama Want to reduce violence? How about tougher sentencing for career criminals? Mess up your voters wouldn't it?
@BarackObama Are they calling democrat constituents and telling them to knock it off?
@BarackObama wow more blatant lies! Must be those low information voters Gruber mentioned buying this BS
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA @BarackObama
@BarackObama @OFA Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Peddling bullshit
@BarackObama Somebody expects his little minions to believe another lie to keep them engaged in their time wasting efforts!
With the exception of a few lunatic far left run states you guys got your asses handed to you along w/ nanny Bloomberg! #2A @BarackObama
Why do almost all the mass murders occur in gun free zones? Don't let facts get in the way of your reckless ant-gun agenda! @BarackObama
Why do states that have loser gun laws have far fewer murders than states like NY and Illinois?  @BarackObama
@BarackObama instead of lying to yourselves and to your cult members, why not do ppl good by educating on how to safely handle a weapon.
@BarackObama #FAIL
.@BarackObama and your attempted gun grab keeps failing...like your administration
@BarackObama The Federal government is trying to usurp the Constitution of the United States of America; and you are happy.  Sad...
Anyone who wants to reduce gun violence should get ghetto rats to stop shooting each other and everyone else. Your peeps, @BarackObama.
@BarackObama has anyone noticed that 90% of the people to say positive things about Obama are from other countries?
@BarackObama stop targeting guns. The gun is not the criminal,the person holding it is. A knife or a baseball bat is just as lethal..
