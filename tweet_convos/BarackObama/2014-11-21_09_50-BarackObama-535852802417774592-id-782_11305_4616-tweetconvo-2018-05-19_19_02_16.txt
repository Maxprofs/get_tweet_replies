@BarackObama @PaulStewartII how exactly did he do anything to "fix"it?There was nothing wrong with the current system, enforcement was broke
@stainless10fp @BarackObama after a few days, when I stop laughing so hard that it's making me hurt, I will answer that...
@PaulStewartII @BarackObama sure, take all the time you need to come up moth more B.S. and lies. Thought that stuff came quicker to u
@stainless10fp @BarackObama look, there is a population half the size of Canada living underground in America; doing the dirty work...
@PaulStewartII @BarackObama this helps nobody but criminals.
@stainless10fp @BarackObama there are not 20 million criminals... that is just stupid talk intended to create fear and alienation...
@PaulStewartII @BarackObama paying taxes, they would stop leeching off the system. I think you're confused about who's confused here
@stainless10fp @BarackObama sure. Whatever you say.
@BarackObama I saw a facebook picture of a vet holding a sign saying "Vet's before immigrants"  ...really? I swear the logic is astounding!
@DesireeG85 @BarackObama I'm done trying to explain....gnight.
@DesireeG85 @BarackObama I don't need to...you missed it. And I don't owe you an explanation. Look on my page where I did several times.
@DesireeG85 @BarackObama you came at me with all caps so by the time I got to you I was frustrated. Sorry. Have a nice day.
@BarackObama If the GOP don't agree they are free to pass an Immigration bill! The GOP lawsuit is a waste of Taxpayer money.
@GROIDS2235 @BarackObama oh and offering welfare to illegals that want to come to get something for nothing is sage financial usage?
@oneil_alen @BarackObama What are you talking about? The GOP, has within their power to pass immigration bill today! Pressure them to do it!
@GROIDS2235 @BarackObama Or we press back and demand this President follow the letter of the law and support what immigration laws exist now
@oneil_alen @BarackObama Press forward as any President with a dithering leaderless Congress should do. Press on!
@GROIDS2235 @BarackObama A President that usurps the Constitution for his own political agenda. Yes! he is the first to go exec route.

@BarackObama their main agenda is for Obama to fail so that no other blacks will ever think to run for the white house. No matter what
@Rasfassil what the fuck are you talking about? He made a very bad decision not because he is black but because he is the worst POTUS EVER!
@SirNickUFC Gop wants to make sure no blacks or no minors are seeking the white house.This is their hidden agenda. AMERICA IS WATCHING
@Rasfassil You Mam are a Racist FUCKING MORON... GTFO My TimeLine
@SirNickUFC show me one item that GOP agreed with Obama. One thing ? Then you will know who is racist. I am not racist . Racism is cowardly
@BarackObama you ma nigga
@BarackObama @tancincolaw Yes, of course ! It's bout time the President did acted on it, it was his first term promise !
@BarackObama  Well done
@BarackObama If taking jobs from Americans, adding to people on welfare, and adding to overcrowded schools is called "helping".
@BarackObama Atleast its a step forward. Even thought Obama should have acted sooner on this.

LOL you are Gruber's favorite voter

@LeChatNoire4
@BarackObama No, he very much damaged the nation and set back the chances of much-needed Immigration reform. And knew it when he did.
@BarackObama @LeChatNoire4 retweets don't work.  I agree! #passabill

@BarackObama Mr. President you are the USA's "Jackie Robinson" President. Amazing Performance! @ImpactDemocracy
@BarackObama this deals with past illegal immigrants, what about future plans to stop the problems
@BarackObama : of course, our President couldn't do better. He deserves to stay in the White House for a longer period.
@BarackObama Retweet if you think Obama is a pussy who needs to be impeached. #ImmigrationAction
Which law gives @BarackObama authority to amnesty illegal aliens?
@TFinn82 @BarackObama an unconstitutional one!
Keep asking. They can't answer bc it's unconstitutional. @MDBishop82 @BarackObama
@TFinn82 @BarackObama hahahaha and it's his own demographic that suffers. He ain't to bright.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama he did not do the right thing his actions will hand the presidency to Republicans in 2016

@BarackObama If somebody has a better idea, get busy!!
@BarackObama I am proud of President Obama. Continue to STAND STRONG!
@BarackObama The erosion of common sense continues.  Here's a key word for you: "ILLEGALLY," as in, "they're here ILLEGALLY."
@BarackObama And why are you on Twitter, anyway?  You're a president, not a celebrity.
@BarackObama @Mellynjess 
Without A Doubt!!
@BarackObama
@BarackObama He never does the right thing.
@BarackObama @bmorsh He deserves the Presidential Medal of Freedom (bestowed by himself). Joking aside, a huge and noble act of courage.
@KiwiReporter @BarackObama Well, Democrats in the US know what is written on the wall. Might as well do some good while they can.
@bmorsh The U.S. might consider a unicameral model, as Ben Franklin originally suggested, similar to the Iroquois longhouse.
@KiwiReporter Not sure if that's a good idea. It makes it easier for big $$$ to own government. But I could be wrong.
@BarackObama @now7grandkids 4 Real Yes
@BarackObama  good Person
By circumventing the whole checks n balances??

@BarackObama
@BarackObama I didn't hear anything that would classify as "Obama help fix our broken immigration system". 2 wrongs do not a right make.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Nope! Last time I checked you are not a King or a Queen(?) #PresidentialTantrum  Follow the law like everybody else!
@BarackObama Keep moving us forward President Obama!
@ActDontReact @Kaygirl8Lawana @BarackObama 
@BarackObama 
Is he said he will do immigration reform?
@BarackObama 
Black men doing slave owner job
@BarackObama
@BarackObama How does immigration reform affect AA unemployment. Will they not go vote to show their disappointment?
@BarackObama @clrih9 this was in your site too Mister President ! So good for American economy ! Thank you for it !
.@BarackObama .@fileright WRONG!!! We are a land of Laws! Presidential OVERREACH !
@BarackObama did the right thing , now it's time for repulicans to shut up and get to work on this issue.
@BarackObama @fileright Illegal action. Obama you said so over 20 times. This was a base short term payback Poisons well for real reform
@BarackObama You will never walk alone. Peoples power are with you
@BarackObama hell no I will be glad when ur gone
@BarackObama good morning. Bisa ikut saya. Terima kasih. Salam
@BarackObama  both house controlled by Republican @to_meb he has nothing to do but resign & change American politics for ever.  As #African

- @BarackObama @FRANI20 About 10 million undocumented should re-tweet this.
@ocblues @BarackObama POC beginning to be majority
@BarackObama @NeilStandish
@BarackObama Good intention, poor solution.
@BarackObama People have been trying to legally get into this country for years. What about them? Why are we granting amnesty to illegals?
@BarackObama It, in a way, encourages illegal passage into this country.
@BarackObama This makes it easier for those who cheat the system than for immigrants trying to do this the right way.
@BarackObama How can a singular fine make up for the lack of pay of taxes over what could be much more than 5 years?
@BarackObama I m proud of President Obama for taking charge
@BarackObama gracias ha dado un gran paso pero aun falta mucho!
@barackobama @marthakarua in 1980s Republican Ronald Reagan did the same: why are Republicans whining?
@barackobama @marthakarua Simply 
did  something to make life bearable 4 people  who have only known suffering.
@BarackObama ..u did right Mr.President.God bless you,God bless America
@BarackObama It is the right decision. God help Mr President
@BarackObama u are the man Barack obama

@BarackObama Jesus saved lives and he has saved lives we needs more Jesus likes, The Pope and Mr. Obama are the best of our times.
@BarackObama but why did you wait until the 6th year of your presidency to do it? Once you're out of office, they'll be SOL.
@BarackObama So the legal would be immigrant still needs a uni degree but Pedro who violated US laws can just stay? Not fair.
@BarackObama absolutely wrong.
@BarackObama @Ashbos1 He did because Congress didn't , now they will have to do their job and act instead of continuing amnesty and not

@BarackObama I think you did the right thing!  Ithink congress should get to work on this issue and other busines for the American people.
@BarackObama He's a good man. A lot of people disagreed with Lincoln in his day http://www.civilwar.org/hallowed-ground-magazine/unpopular-mr-lincoln.html …
