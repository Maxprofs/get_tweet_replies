@BarackObama 
Nothing you do will ever be transparent.
How many things have you signed that you don't have the power to sign?
@BarackObama 'LEAD ON TRADE' IS WITH STRONG ECONOMY WITH POLICY FOR MORE SAVINGS, INVESTMENTS, MORE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR INVESTORS, MANAGEMENTS
The American people deserve to know what's in the #TPP. #LeadOnTrade and #ShowUsTheText @BarackObama!
@BarackObama we need you out of our country we don't like you!
@BarackObama nope
@BarackObama yes sr. But it's also  time to have a equal world, where the poor countries get the benefits on the trade dials.
@BarackObama With respect Mr. Prez, shouldn't the public/Congress be allowed to read the text of the agreement if it's to be transparent?
@BarackObama I agree with you, Mr. President
@BarackObama "Sign your name... on something you can't read, apparently, before signing it." Is this that Trans-Pacific Partnership bull?
@BarackObama I think it's rude, immature, and disrespectful to insult the president, any US president.
@BarackObama Transparent? I guess you're not talking about the TPP!
@BarackObama #LeadOnTrade How about PRO-US trade?
@BarackObama 
@BarackObama
@BarackObama If we have a trade plan we don't want somebody else stealing it before we can implement it. I trust Barack!
@BarackObama America needs to not negotiate with terrorists.  Enough talk with Iran. Quit leading from behind.

@BarackObama No offense to you, but why should anyone want to sign anything, when given such a vague explanation of what it is? #LeadOnTrade
@BarackObama: So the TPP is gone, and something new is being worked up in its place?
