@BarackObama Very presidential to whine about it like a little girl on Twitter.
@HillarysTeeth That's not a whine! He's been telling Congress to do their job for 8 years.
@mrscorie That's a whine, Corie. He's been a terrible president. Always crying like a bitch and blaming others for his failures.
@HillarysTeeth Who has be blamed. And given where we were in 2008 one could argue we are much better off.
@mrscorie Someone who hasn't been paying attention could argue that. Someone with a brain? Nah.
@HillarysTeeth Every aspect of our economy has turned around. We have had 64 months of private sector job growth.
@mrscorie I have a hard time believing anything you say after you lied to me and said the Dow was below 7K.
@HillarysTeeth you don't have to believe me. The numbers don't lie. When Barack took office we were bleeding jobs a month.
@BarackObama As Joe Biden said, not feasible in an election year. Listen to your VP.
@PhillipBurdine @BarackObama president has a constitutional duty & right to put forward a nominee and Senate has obligation to consider them
@g_man500 @BarackObama You are right but their is no obligated time frame. Remember, the Dems also did this.
@PhillipBurdine @BarackObama don't think they did actually.  That is beside the point I don't care who is in control a delay is just wrong
@g_man500 @BarackObama Blatant hypocrisy.
@PhillipBurdine @BarackObama that is just noise.  The fact remains a block is unprecedented. 10 months before a new president is sworn in.
@PhillipBurdine @BarackObama noise from politicians in the past Democrat or otherwise is just that. We are talking about now.
@g_man500 @BarackObama No hearing is unprecedented, not a Block. A hearing will change nothing. #BidenRule
@BarackObama they only see dark-skinned principles
@jontheloveher90 @BarackObama that's a very racist thing 2 say. What's Obama's excuse 4 his actions 4 the 2007/2008 Scotus appointee by Bush
@ElectionWoes @BarackObama define racism
@jontheloveher90 @BarackObama you were implying that they are making a decision not to vote based upon the color of Obama's skin R U not?
@ElectionWoes @BarackObama dude please study black history study politics
@jontheloveher90 @BarackObama Not needed 4this. Why did u make that comment? What were you implying then? How did you see race play a part?
@ElectionWoes @BarackObama wake up to the Sun's clarity of the truth is the real deal
@jontheloveher90 @BarackObama No thanks I prefer to live in a world of independent thought and not condemn someone based upon race.
@BarackObama we're going to wait for Donald Trump when he's elected he'll pick the next Supreme Court nominees
not ever in a million years
@BarackObama AS SOON AS YOU DO YOURS we will talk about our REPRESENTATIVES DOing THEIRS !
@BarackObama What? that old thing. Didn't we pass a "do whatever the heck we want" Amendment? I swear I heard Rush say so.
@BarackObama funny Barack Obama talking about being loyal to the Constitution. What a complete joke.
@BarackObama get real. You have screwed your job to the wall and chose to do your own thing even against the constitution.
@BarackObama @jannelloyd Better yet change number of judges on SCOTUS back to the original number of SIX
@BarackObama " Here's another one...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
@BarackObama Lol! We like to get together at lunch and bust a gut listening to Barack Hussein, the famous Groucho Marxist.
@BarackObama mic drop! #firethegop #doyourjob #Imwithher
@BarackObama "refusing to even meet with a SCOTUS nominee" is not banned by the Constitution.
@BarackObama ليش تغلط على اسيادك
@o__22 @BarackObama @ nhjjjkm
@propertyspromo @BarackObama nhjna shno fih
@BarackObama C
@BarackObama @jannelloyd Neither does the contention that they must. Do what Dem's suggested they do w/Rep nominees - vote him down
@BarackObama got no use for you- I can ignore you like you do me
@GregBudwooten @BarackObama you sound slow
@AshaniqueM @BarackObama after surviving stroke,heart attack and lung cancer just can't do much of anything
@GregBudwooten @BarackObama wait are u talking about you or him
@AshaniqueM @BarackObama -8urs I've reached out to him about my WWII art that was done in Hawaii - only answer I got
@GregBudwooten @BarackObama your not the only American with issues
@BarackObama  انت منافق كذاب  و خادم لإسرائيل و ايران و روسيا
@BarackObama أميركا تحولت برئاستك من دوله سيادية حره قيادته الى دولة خادمه ل ايران و روسيا و أصبحت امريكا دولة فاشله
@asas201611 @BarackObama  كويس انك تتابعني  ي ابو زق
@asas201611 @BarackObama انت مريض نفسيا يا كلب الغنم
@asas201611 @BarackObama بلوك يا غشيم
@BarackObama even if Reps don't like the nominee, they should at least have decorum & meet with them. Shows bad taste and the death of GOP.
@HoneyBadger5719 @BarackObama Like the democrats in 2007/2008 when bush tried 2 give a Scotus nominee? Or u just using a double standard?
@ElectionWoes @BarackObama double standard on both sides.
@HoneyBadger5719 @BarackObama As long as you realize that the GOP is doing nothing that the Democrats haven't already done before.
@ElectionWoes @BarackObama yep. I think both are evil.
@HoneyBadger5719 @BarackObama as do I which is why I'll vote Trump. If they both want him out he must pose a threat 2 both parties.
@ElectionWoes @BarackObama or, he's the mirror image of both and they don't like the reflection.
@HoneyBadger5719 @BarackObama I mean really how much damage can he do. We still have a house and Senate to protect us.
@BarackObama @Libraryben has there been a nominee yet? did i miss something? Honest question, not sarcastic.
@SconnieSpurs @BarackObama not as-of-yet but rhetoric by some  has been that no nominee would get hearings. This is the rhetorical retort.
@Libraryben fair enough. But rhetoric is rhetoric. if @BarackObama wants to put the pressure on, all he has to do is nominate someone.
@SconnieSpurs @BarackObama that's the point: All POTUS "has to" do is nominate if all Senate "has to do" is advise and consent.
@BarackObama @SenatorBurr @ThomTillis 
#DoYourJob
@BarackObama It's an honour. Deal with it.
@BarackObama Why so you can steal our rights?
@BarackObama Confirm now or wait for a Liberal nominee - your choice, US Senate.
@BarackObama @smaddoxsr Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution requires the President to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.
@v_martin639 @BarackObama Yes it does.
@smaddoxsr @BarackObama When the POTUS knowingly protect a judge corruption he should be held accountable!
@BarackObama Senate is Upholding the Constitution. They Have every right to refuse! You think we're Stupid??
@BarackObama
@BarackObama I can't wait till you are out of office.
@BarackObama when has reason, the law or the common good for that matter ever  guided the GOP in the last 20 years?
@BarackObama Mr. President if they are even refusing to meet with a #scotus nominee. Isn't that treason? Just saying.
@BarackObama not according to biden in '92
@BarackObama Impossible for Senate to advise and consent if they refuse to participate in the process. They are violating the Constitution.
@BarackObama their job is only a paycheck to them
@BarackObama we're with you.  The Republicans are hypocrites.   If a Republican was in office they wouldn't be doing this. Shifty they are.
@BarackObama
 keep doing what's best..love your tenacity
@BarackObama Why not ask the front runners for POTUS who they would nominate? Could be Garland, then we can move forward!
@BarackObama You tell them Mr President!  They spit on the Constitution!  They need to be fired!  Tired of paying them to do nothing!
@BarackObama refusing to go to police and judge's funerals what is the difference
@BarackObama Amazing how obstructionists can stop a dedicated president from doing his job! And they wonder how a Donald Trump has appeared.
@BarackObama #shuttheheckup!#can'twaituntilyouroutofoffice!
@BarackObama Don't be a #hypocrite- we remember your vote to block #POTUS Bush. @Senate_GOPs should take the higher ground and do their job.
@BarackObama The Senate has been doing this since the 90's, doesn't make it right though. http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol29_No1_White.pdf …
@BarackObama  In the private sector people get fired for not doing their jobs. Their 
 pay needs to be suspended.
@BarackObama #OBAMAoCaraDeuGolpeNoBrasil
@BarackObama I yeah items pop up i know would work for us futurly creating numorus accountability reaching great huge business!
@BarackObama your party would do the same thing, so don't think we the people are stupid. Get over it and do YOUR job. protect out borders
@BarackObama next president should choose this judge
@BarackObama shouldn't only reference the Constitution when it's convenient for your agenda. Sounds like they all #followtheleader
@BarackObama I and the Brigade support you 100%.  It is time for Republicans to step up and do their job.  #DoYourJob
@BarackObama @Senate_GOPs @McConnellPress
@BarackObama #DoYourJob right back 'atcha, Mr President.
! RT @BarackObama Refusing to even meet with a #SCOTUS nominee has no basis in the Constitution. #DoYourJob
@BarackObama "No" is also advice.
@BarackObama TAKE THAT LOSER JOB AWA ASAP !!!!!!! You the President who do they think they are ?!
@BarackObama The law is the law. ! The Act is part of the majority who elected you president of the United States to enforce the law.!...
@BarackObama TO HELL WITH HOMO OBAMA AND THE HORSE HE RODE IN ON.  HE DID NOT CONSULT WITH THE CONGRESS AS HE IS CHARGED TO DO,  SO FORGETIT
@BarackObama you haven't done yours for 7 yrs, why should they?
@BarackObama what happen w/u'r 0'bama free phone and tax payer paid pen. Can't get ur way, cry now? 2bad, no sympathy here
@BarackObama lol, a rule less man ask others to follow the law. Crazy!
@BarackObama They are just being dogmatic and partisan. It seems to that they are determind to re-write the constitution.
@BarackObama Telling it like it is! GOP CONGRESSMEN DO YOUR JOBS!
@BarackObama As a good recorded to predicted USA president... I saw USA will having "lightning strike twice " And make all histories 
@BarackObama What  does the Senate think about your conclusion?
@BarackObama throwing shade
@BarackObama Youe know that you were elected as a fall guy for washingtons illegal taxation/oligarchy don't you? #patsy
@BarackObama
@BarackObama 牛逼啊
@BarackObama Suddenly you care about the Constitution. Cute.
@BarackObama seriously????   This is craycray.   Please don't let ms trump remodel the White House people!!!!!
.@BarackObama When have you done your job, or given one crap about the Constitution? #lameduck
@BarackObama #YouDidntDoYoursForBushAppointment

#Hypocrite
@BarackObama absolutely agree the senate is out of line on the Supreme Court nomination. @SenateMajLdr the senate needs to do its job.
@BarackObama You want to talk Constitution? How your illegal DACA?
@BarackObama enforce immigration laws #doyourjob
@BarackObama I believe you overlooked the word "consent" in there. Do YOUR fucking job. Start with your kids.
@BarackObama LIE!
Article 2
Section 2
@BarackObama So, did you take the advice of the Senate into consideration yet, or are you just being a jackass again?
@BarackObama Another Absolute Lie!
Do you really think we won't investigate?!
@BarackObama Do your job? Wow... Tweet this from the back nine?
@BarackObama, I admire your endurance and coolness to deal with a lowest rated Congress hijacked by a dysfunctional Republican Party.
@BarackObama you're right!  And they will meet with them.  Eventually. "Elections have consequences."
@BarackObama such. a. crybaby.  Dust off the US Constitution and read it... #Jan2017
.@BarackObama "elections have consequences", beotch! Hahahahahahahaha!
Refusing to even meet with a #SCOTUS nominee has no basis in the Constitution. #DoYourJob 
@BarackObama ...WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE SENATE, Mr. Constitutional "scholar." Get bent.
@BarackObama Did you nominate someone? No? You haven't nominated anyone? Well, you're right - someone sure isn't doing their job.
@BarackObama Just delaying the inevitable DEMOCRATIC nomination from the next DEMOCRATIC President!
@BarackObama Can you post the provision about unlimited abortions?  I can't seem to find that one.
@BarackObama That isn't the entire Section 2 & therefore misleading to Americans who fail to read our Constitution. It says "He shall have
@BarackObama Power, by and w/ the Advice & Consent of the Senate, 2 make Treaties, provided 2/3 of the Senate present concur; & he shall
@BarackObama nominate, & by & W/ the Advice & Counsel of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors et al whose Appointments r not herein
@BarackObama otherwise provided for, & wh/ shall b established by Law; but the Congress May by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior
@BarackObama Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Department."
@BarackObama O, so now the Constitution is suddenly so conveniently applicable?
"With the consent" How can you force consent? @BarackObama
@BarackObama have you nominated one?
@BarackObama Doesn't say "can". Says "shall". It is the President's OBLIGATION to nominate.
@BarackObama The constitution is very clear. It was written in order to avoid what's happening now for example.
@BarackObama Uh, cart before the horse? Why don't you #DoYourJob, and nominate someone.
@BarackObama Boy are you stupid. Read it again.
.@BarackObama
Talk about the pothead calling the kettle black.
Hey obaMAO - #DoYourJob
#SCOTUS
@BarackObama Your reading comprehension is not very good, huh?
@BarackObama The Senate has advised that you get no more #scotus picks. #knowyourjob
@BarackObama
@BarackObama do you have your mom jeans on when you type these?
@BarackObama Neither do Executive Orders designed specifically to circumvent Congress & the Constitution.

That hasn't stopped you, has it?
.@BarackObama Um, not seeing "...and the Senate shall meet with them in there. You're a Harvard grad, pretty sure you can read, sir.
@BarackObama "and by and with the advice and consent..." not a word there that they HAVE to. But, you can't appoint w/out them doing it.
@BarackObama As former <ahem> "Constitutional Law Professor" surely you realize "advice and consent" doesn't mean rubber-stamping, right?
@BarackObama do the country a favor take next8monts off go to Hi @ golf with the movie stars
Just like a Democrat to want to take away someone's right to consent. Right, @BarackObama?
Refusing to even meet with a #SCOTUS nominee has no basis in the Constitution. #DoYourJob 
@BarackObama -- Their advice: Go jump in a lake, Barry.  And take your nominee with you.
#poorbarry #allwet #quackquack
@BarackObama "Meeting with the nominee" has no basis in the Constitution either.  For that matter, you aren't compelled to nominate anybody.
@BarackObama so who have you nominated, big guy? #doyourjob
. @BarackObama me looking for the part in that sentence that says hearings must be held
Well, then you should stop fucking around and nominate someone they'll confirm, @BarackObama. #DoYourJob
Refusing to even meet with a #SCOTUS nominee has no basis in the Constitution. #DoYourJob 
@BarackObama Constitution states they don't have to confirm appointee, either.
@BarackObama 
Great man
@BarackObama To be fair, they are really busy putting out fires over there.
@BarackObama what the matter your royal highness. Do not like being told no. You always pout when do nit get your way
@BarackObama You talk about "do your job"? Bad jokes while world sees us as a mess. U lied about a 160 countries. Sen.Bradley beats u 1on1.
@BarackObama 我也是正在为工作而奔波呢！
@BarackObama Language can't be anymore clearer than that. So-called Defenders of the Constitution; refusing to obey it's Laws.  Defines GOP!
@BarackObama sad to see thes repub idjits.
@BarackObama this must be driving u crazy nothing u can do about it.
@BarackObama nor does it obligate anyone to meet with a nominee. That little 'consent' word is such a pain, isn't it Mr President?
@BarackObama Our goal is to bring national attention to the corrupt for profit prison system in Mississippi.
@BarackObama  Did you nominate someone?
@BarackObama You have my support re: the new SCOTUS, Mr. President. The Repubs are acting reprehensibly!
@BarackObama Since when does the GOP leadership care about the Constitution?
@BarackObama  Helo sir ur welcome
@BarackObama YOU CANNOT BE TALKING ABOUT DOING YOIR JOB! You've never done yours yourself!
@BarackObama just go away. That's all we ask.

@BarackObama you're one to talk about the constitution
@BarackObama Didn't you agree to be part of a filibuster to accomplish the same objective against Bush? #hypocrisy

@BarackObama GOP Senate's assault on American Justice is protecting corporate criminals.  Fill the seats, do you job.
@BarackObama criminal class cheering GOP Senate #GOP #senate  scotus
@BarackObama why should they vote you Democrat didn't when you had control
@BarackObama That's "consent" of the Senate. Not rubberstamp. Senate is not required to consent.
@BarackObama Your entire presidency has no basis in the constitution.  You swore to defend it and all you've done is destroy it. Fool!!
@BarackObama Elections have consequences. Who said this?
@BarackObama you gotta do something about all this KKK #DonaldTrump is allowing
@BarackObama #DoYourJob demand investigation #SerenaShims murder . Pursue justice the same as she did and died for @OperationSerena

@BarackObama Also: notice the amendment in question doesn't say they can't delay it? It's not forbidden so... Yeah... Nice try though.
@BarackObama It's cute you're quoting the constitution when it can get you what you want but you've spent eight years trying to destroy it.
@BarackObama congratulations. you found the #Constitution how about you Preserve, Protect & Defend it, like your OATH states #DoYourJob
