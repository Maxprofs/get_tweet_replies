@BarackObama @MGliksmanMDPhD Too much wireless in our heads. Imagine 30+ students using wifi in a compact class room; more stress+CANCER.

@BarackObama we lead With example
@BarackObama schools being wired is a good idea,but where we can get the money we need ?
@BarackObama WiFi isn't free - the coffee vendor pays for that out of his goods sold.
@BarackObama Give them free wifi to go with their free phones, food, housing, medical insurance and college.  That will give them pride!
