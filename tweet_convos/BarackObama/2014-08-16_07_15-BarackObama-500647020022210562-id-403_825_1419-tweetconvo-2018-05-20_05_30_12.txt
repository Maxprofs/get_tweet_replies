@GContreras79 @BarackObama Will you feel that way when you can't find a healthcare practitioner when you need one? smh #DebtKillsDreams
@kionaatplay First, I didn't mention healthcare. Second, health care was better before Obama. Welcome to ban for stupidity.
@GContreras79 Lol, prime example of an inability to engage in thoughtful discourse. Learn that stuff in college I guess... ;)
@BarackObama @Jaquois13 The closer to free it is, the more benefit to the country - education benefits society, not just the individual.

@BarackObama why no active commentary on #ferguson ? I lived in DC near Georgetown 7+ yrs. I and many citizens disappointed in your silence
@jdsboston @BarackObama Barack Obama made statements in regards to Ferguson I believe on Thursday.
@PurestRebel_ Tx. no tweets if so. All I saw in stream was education related. Strange, cabinet members are not making appearance #shortfall
@PurestRebel_ found this from August 12th. Not much of anything. He's a great eloquent potus. We should expect more
