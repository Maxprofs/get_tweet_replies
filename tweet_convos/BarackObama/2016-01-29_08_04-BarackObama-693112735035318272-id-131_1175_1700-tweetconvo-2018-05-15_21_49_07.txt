@WhiteHouse @Benioff Equal Say Equal Pay
@RalphSchiano @WhiteHouse go to Russia then i believe it would be more to your liking. We already have done it in CA.
@WhiteHouse women get less money because they work different jobs. Look at the most remunerative fields and college enrollment by sex...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama SOS-MAY DAY Colombia sucumbe ante comunismo NARCOTERRORISTAS FARC. Democracia agoniza gracias a presidente Santos
@WhiteHouse Why the propaganda? You put out a lie and don't clarify women get paid same for same job, same educations, same dedication
@WhiteHouse I like how this has been debunked for over a decade but you still use it as fact. The science is settled on this

@WhiteHouse  ok share
@WhiteHouse you started at the WH correct? Hypocrites
@WhiteHouse How do you advance something that has been in effect for years. Advance you're efforts with ISIS, they're nonexistent.
@WhiteHouse there is a solid reason for the wage differences between a man and a women in certain industries
@WhiteHouse what happened to the overtime rule changes? underpaid exempt employees want to know
@WhiteHouse 

RT the bad news: this is as lame as everything else from the WH.
.
@WhiteHouse this is completely false lol... Nobody earns 79 cents for the same job. Find me one job where that's true.
@WhiteHouse it's about time male servers and strippers start making the same!! LOL idk what's a bigger joke, this, or #Obama
@WhiteHouse equal pay was extinguished in 1968 by JFK
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Very Very misleading!!!  But I guess that's the way the political cookie crumbles. Can't POTUS just tell the truth?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I Support This!!!
@WhiteHouse as long as the woman works the same hours and doesn't get pregnant she should be fine #stopfeministpropaganda
@WhiteHouse A non-issue. Want to do something really good for your last days in office? Legalize pot.
@WhiteHouse #EqualPay
@WhiteHouse it should all ready be a law
@WhiteHouse let's advance no work = to no pay.
@WhiteHouse The lady that cares
@WhiteHouse  That is all crap. then the women should not take job and go elsewhere and sue them for not following the Lilly Ledbetter act
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama http://nice.post 
@WhiteHouse Use ALL the stats, not just cherry-picked and this is a NON-ISSUE...another "global warming" farce to feed the stupid.
@WhiteHouse #EqualPay So are we discussing Equal Pay for White Women or all Women? I guess this is my answer-icons show white women
@WhiteHouse just another thing to do rather than face isis  problem
@WhiteHouse are you going to pay women in the white house the same
@WhiteHouse: "RT the good news: We're taking new steps to advance #EqualPay for women →…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=693102420688121856 …
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I love my president
@WhiteHouse Women, wanting to work for pennies, doesnt always make sense. Look us up. http://www.gregparker.youngevity.com .
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama sure u r. Just like ur EPA took care of checking Flint's water supply. INEPT, CORRUPT, NOT TRUSTWORTHY.
@WhiteHouse #boohoo want equal pay, don't get a degree in feminist liberal arts and get a real job
@WhiteHouse @RepBrianHiggins why are Congressional Reps not required to participate in Affordable Healthcare Act? That seems equitable
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama sorry,still don't understand how 's the job
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Before you "take steps", you should do better research into the numbers. I recommend following @CHSommers research.
@rdube @WhiteHouse @BarackObama @CHSommers
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama "Earned." We already have equal pay. If you want to be paid right, negotiate your salary and get a real degree.
@WhiteHouse women make the same pay as men. Dem throw this unproven illegitimate made up crap around to stir fools up. Complete lie
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama With due respect "if" the wage gap was true, why would men even be hired if companies could save 23% hiring women?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama help me
@WhiteHouse QUIT LYING TO US!!!!
@WhiteHouse there is no such thing as equal work. The military pays more to TIS for the same rank. It's still the same job.
@WhiteHouse 
See what the problem is they knew 
I was coming
They knew it wasn't there wife
So that meant it wasn't their daughters
@WhiteHouse Agree?! I lived it! Battling 50 years and hearing the same old tune from GOP.
@WhiteHouse Going to better enforce existing laws then? Good idea. Better than creating more useless, BS laws so you can say you "fixed" it.
@WhiteHouse 
CLOUD MUSIC
COOL!
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Mr Obama I'm saddened that your only in office two terms I truly mean what I say you the best thing the USOFAHAD. J
@WhiteHouse just shared your tweet here: http://rbl.ms/1LhDHNf

@WhiteHouse @RepBrianHiggins Propaganda .& yrs ago Pelosi was the Speaker. Is Higgins a Pelosi supporter? I smell RINO
@WhiteHouse THANK YOU!!!
@WhiteHouse what about SS For Seniors WHAT ARE YOU DO ING ABOUT THAT????
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama ,so Hillary would be cost savings? Kidding.
@WhiteHouse Earnings a year are different from wages. What does the evidence suggest is the reasons they earn less...
@WhiteHouse why are we left alone to die. Biafra are dying in Nigeria while the world stands in akimbo
@WhiteHouse Thanks for sharing that update - it's now live here: http://rbl.ms/1y411Xg 
@WhiteHouse Don't you think you should start in the WH, where the pay difference is still 13% between men and women?
@WhiteHouse Women do receive equal pay for equal work. The wage gap is a myth, and I'm embarrassed that the head of the country believes it.
@WhiteHouse The year is now 2016, and I cannot even believe this inequity still exists. If it weren't so ridiculous it would be laughable.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse It aint signed.I'll wait till it trickles down in the pockets.Oh and what about back pay???
@WhiteHouse Advanced women, yes. We deserve so much.
@WhiteHouse That's not who we are
@WhiteHouse This is erroneous data and more propaganda.
@WhiteHouse Great i need employment i head up the Lighten Up America Team
@WhiteHouse Stop the lies. Americans have suffered
horrible setbacks under this administration. Only one
short year til your gone.
@WhiteHouse doesn't mean you have to play by their twisted view of the world.
@PaulLitvaitis @WhiteHouse the time for equal pay is now. Employers have a choice.
@WhiteHouse playing this like a political game. You have the facts just because a few feminist that didn't negotiate salary get antsy
@WhiteHouse what? if you weren't before then you need to be arrested cause that is already illegal. "Earned" is a word with a definition.
@PaulLitvaitis @WhiteHouse it sounds like you don't think the women considered in this study work hard to earn what they get, why?
@KratzerCanby @WhiteHouse because women take on less risky roles and if you are not negotiating hard enough in a salary based job that's
@PaulLitvaitis @KratzerCanby @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse ...guess you're starting within your own walls, amirite?
@WhiteHouse Are White House staffers paid equally? Are democrat congressional staffers paid equally?
@WhiteHouse Congratulations, it's only been 7 years to the day that @POTUS signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act.
@WhiteHouse What about terrible GDP growth? An expanding economy serves the best interests of all and gives workers leverage,
@WhiteHouse   from România 
@WhiteHouse women have equal pay under the law! Enforce laws, stay relevant!
@WhiteHouse It's like you're secretly listening to Bernie's issues.....I wonder.
@HighLowJackGame @WhiteHouse  Who killed Jesus
