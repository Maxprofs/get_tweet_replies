If only you felt the same way about babies who are murdered during abortion.
Not a viable chance. Move on and stop wasting taxpayers money. Balance the stinking budget
@pamMOvotes of course  the GOP r for plaguing the USA with guns, for more senseless murders done to our citizens
@RepJohnLarson @YouTube 
Awesome Rep. Larson. Keep up your good work! #guncontrol
@YouTube GO FOR IT TELL AP EVERY STEP YOU ARE DOING enough is enough we need to embarrass the speaker and Repubs but inform
YES! Thank you! Please persevere and affect some positive change http://bit.ly/28XhhoH 
Walking to join my colleagues on the House Floor in support of @repjohnlewis and his sit-in. #nomorescilence
@laurenspieller Right, on! Thank you @RepCardenas for standing with Rep Lewis! #NoBillNoBreak #CommonSenseGunLaws

Always our hero! Fighting the fight for what's right!
Thank you, @repjohnlewis, for your courageous words and actions! #TheTimeForSilenceIsOver #Orlando
Maybe you should address defending the constitution or demand that the FBI do their job
@YouTube Sorry, John, but you lost me when you endorsed Madame War Monger Goldwater Girl...
@HouseDemocrats   Thank you, thank you, thank you.   #NoBillNoBreak
remember when you endorsed Hillary Clinton over Civil Rights protester Bernie Sanders? Oops amirite?
@SenatorReid @YouTube so I thought you where on this list?
@YouTube Majority of Americans want this VOTE!! It does not matter what branch of Government you support! Go Social Media!
@SenatorBoxer Now, this is leadership.
how little a clue of this Man & history do you have?  Hostile much?  Don't go away mad, just go away!
Amazing. @repjohnlewis and Democrat colleagues stage Senate sit-in to address gun violence https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZq2F9LcUrI&feature=youtu.be … #NoBillNoBreak
@laurenlaverne 8-year-olds like this one were/are on a list.  Congressman Lewis himself has been on it.
If you remember when Cat Stevens was detained b/c he was on a list - it's *that* list Dems want to add people to.
@HouseDemocrats Amen! Thanks for always fighting for us! 
they are chanting, no vote, no break. Sick & tired of being sick & tired & WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED
@AuntLulie @smileyt22 @Mahogany1992
Chills watching this. And also a reminder that we are all lucky to share a country w/ @repjohnlewis
My colleagues & I have had enough. We are sitting-in on the House Floor until we get a vote to address gun violence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZq2F9LcUrI&feature=youtu.be …
Thank you!!!
What is your proposal?
@YouTube we support you!!
I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
@WhipHoyer Just another step to take our rights. Why don't u do something about radical Muslims and leave decent people be.
You swore an oath to uphold the Constitution of the US. Read the Second Amendment. You don't have authority to take it away.
Back to Georgia go taking care of Atlanta it is a big Mass over there, you remind me the politicians from the country where I came from corrupted liberals only thing you guys wanna it is make money that is the only reason you are a politician.
Thank you, to you and your colleagues, for trying to do something serious about gun violence!
Throwing a temper tantrum on the floor isn't "serious".
You are still my #Hero sir! #SitIn #TheHill
he's killing the bill of rights.  He is no hero
And yes he is a Hero. He fought and fights for this country everyday. Please read the Truth!
destroyer of the constitution.  He is no hero.  He's the worst
I think you are!
say something with some damn substance
Ok, you are an idiot!
you a poo head!
You're trying to force a vote on unconstitutional bills that wouldn't solve anything @repjohnlewis. Due process matters. #5A #2A
Can you look up the Admendment that determines that the voice & will of the majority of voters can be muted?
Unless you change the Constitution the majority doesn't get to deprive people of inalienable rights. @repjohnlewis
Noflynobuy is not depriving people of due process, unless u can come up with a case that does & ppl on the..
Of course it does. Many people get on the list mistakenly, can't find out why or get off it. No due process.
of immigration fraud & his relationship w/the Portland Seven after a person informed the FBI he tried to recruit him...
I do not understand? If you take away the guns from the people who have them legally, It goes to the crooks to sell? You all know that there is always a way for the crooks to find a ways. Its like the drugs they find a way to get sell them to us. they get rich. (BILLIONS$$).....
@DennisNewton175

@maddow Good on you Rep. Lewis!  Glad to see your sit in.  It's ALL #goodtrouble!   #RiseupAmerica!
please share ASAP if you find a working platform!  #goodtrouble
Martin Luther King did not die for you liberals you are a shame for his fight for.
but it's the GOP who are the obstructionists 
the only thing they are preventing is Congress going on vacation. They are trying to get things done.
@OpalVadhan Let's get these people some cushions!
You don't think their wallet serves as one already?
no.
that's all they care about.  Control and all that green
Yup Pocahontas Warren living in her 5 million $ house shes with the people right
warren's house was $400,000 earlier today. Did she move?
and just in case it matters:
@PolitiFact  oh god follow up it's only a 2.5 million $ house.
thank you for your courage & leadership & thank you House #democrats - fighting for the change we need! #OccupytheHouse 
take away their security and make it a gun free zone.  See how fast he gets up.
.@repjohnlewis try stomping your feet and holding your breath.
sometimes, that's what it takes!! Better than letting more people die!
get this..nothing they want to do will EVER stop any criminal. Wise up. Plus that constitution thing...
How about you address the issue of democrats supporting terrorists both at home and abroad? @repjohnlewis @LukeRussert
The NRA and their bought politicians want ISIS  terrorists to have guns.
:)). @JosephBXTrader @repjohnlewis @LukeRussert
THANK YOU! Take em to church, Congressman! 
& Preach!
Good. Guns and chairs are scary technology. Only by sitting on the floor can you be safe. *(with armed guards of course)
Solidarity from Long Beach, California! #NoBillNoBreak #holdthefloor
With all due respect, you do not make anybody safer by taking away the rights of law abiding citizens. It just "feels" better.
What about our right to live free of fear of gun violence?
What about our right to live free of the fear of knife, car or pressure cooker violence?

It's a false pretense.
When was the last mass slaughter with any of those?
You don't even follow me. Don't let me have to block you.
So threatened by common sense?
@maureenjohnson Go, John, go!
to north Korea where they have gun control!
God bless @repjohnlewis and I couldn't be prouder to be represented by such an American hero.
he's dismantling the bill of rights.  He's no hero
@blueacoustic We'll send sandwiches.  You're not taking away our 2A rights.
No one's trying to take away your 2A rights.
Not that I believe them, but it would be good if it was true.
thank you!
Thank you for continuing to be an example for my sons and for the future of this country.
I support you!! Stay strong and stand that ground! Doing nothing is not an option!!! Thank you!
There were 2 bi-partisian bills rejected. Done.Over.We're in the 21st century. It's not the 60-'s anymore. How old are U?
@BarackObama @YouTube 
You once made the no fly list. You must be one violent pacifist.
@BarackObama May “Our Force Be With You!” http://easycolorexpress.com 
@NatureGuy101 Thank you for standing up for us. #NoBillNoBreak
@YouTube
 Bless you, sir for standing once again with courage in the face of inaction on gun violence.
I would have thought that you of all people would be against the "No Fly" List being used.
You look sill and we need mature statesmen. 
Shame on you.

Mom
Silly John, just silly. 

Mom
@YouTube thank you for being our voice
i loved the fact that you went back to a non violent protest to address gun violence. those on the other side of the (cont)
@BarackObama your colleagues and you are morons not worth a fraction of the tax payers money you are robbing us of.
We believe in you! #goodtrouble
@marpeesh #NoBillNoBreak
Thank you for actions!
@YouTube thank you John Lewis 4 your bravery. You are the emblem of Democracy
@YouTube  It's your ass! Butbyou might want a masseuse on standby. Just sayin'...
Want to address gun violence? Go home and tell your democrat constituents to freaking behave for a change.
#never enough to defeat violence
start a rolling counter #deaths #hours no vote from House floor
thank you for leading Senator.
thank you! I am a Mother. Protect my kids. Please 
Thank you!
thank you #NoBillNoBreak
@johnlegend 
Thank you John Lewis & the rest of the Dem house #NoBillNoBreak
keep it up!! Where is my rep Jan Schakowsky?
Thank you (and @HouseDemocrats) for trying SOMETHING. You rep the people
@maddow Oooooh this is big !!!
thank you again for your heroism.  I am a Connecticut resident. I stand with you, bless all of you for telling the truth
@BarackObama as in obama's words end the terrorists, hostage taking of our government, treason in action
gun violence is a made up term. I don't hear about knife violence,  hammer violence, etc. Focus on the real problem
Thank you!!!! Please help make this fight about controlling guns, not Muslims. No one needs an assault rifle
A march on the hill is in order. Take the fight to the GOP and the NRA just like the march on Washington. It's a great idea.
@maddow #EnoughIsEnough #OrlandoUnited
Thank you
. Mr John Lewis. Thank you to you and your team. Yes, it's overdue for #justice. #families
You are my HERO! If I were local, I would deliver platters of food! Keep fighting the good fight! #NoBillNoBreak
Thank you!
How about instead of sitting down, walk over to the senate and tell them not to screw over military familes by cutting BAH
I am sitting in with you. Thank you.
Mr. Lewis, thank you for your courage and leadership! Don't give up. Stand your ground.
Thank you for your leadership, year after year and now. #NoBillNoBreak
@YouTube kicking ass for all of us! Thank you
RT @repjohnlewis @BarackObama @VP @HillaryClinton @SenWarren new - The Philosophy Of Vision http://www.amazon.com/dp/1523835850 
@johnlegend can they not work together?
Finally someone has stepped up.  It's way past due.
why not bring attention to the fact that the gov't was warned about Orlando shooter and failed to do enough about it?
we your people are proud - thank you! - a mom
LOL
@YouTube get back in Congress order. And there are no bills any different than 2 days law
Thank you!!!!!!!!
We support gun reform!! #NoBillNoBreak
@YouTube Thank you.
Thank you for trying to do something.
@SenatorReid @YouTube Nothing that has been proposed would have prevented these acts of violence. You're a waste of space.
Lets hope if you can't get something done the republicans will be replaced come Nov for not doing their jobs.
so proud of you. Thank you, my hero!!!
maybe you should start with Chicago.
@JoanneCangal thank you- don't let republicans arm terrorists @CNN
my heartfelt admiration to you all. someone had to take a stand and you have!
I wish U would have done the TPP with the same passion. Politicians are pawns for the lobbyists. Have you not figured it out
@YouTube Bravo and Thank You All Senators.ENOUGH is ENOUGH. No more guns in the wrong hands.
@YouTube  proud of you and your commitment...you're not alone in your convictions!
They all need a diaper change.
God bless you. Thank you for all you do and all you have given to this country.
, Thank you for your leadership! We need to make America safe. #NoBillNoBreak #GunControl
You are an embarrassment to constitutional rights.
@ScottPetersSD @SpeakerRyan #holdthefloor #feartheNRA do not fear passionate and open political action. Cameras should stay on
@DudeKembro  Thank you for your leadership: a real American hero.
they can keep their asses on the floor. Bottom feeding liberals belong there.
Thank you.
We're with you!!
we have your back!!  we are calling and supporting this!
perhaps the people of America should have a sit down to show Obama he's a terrible pres. 
Hilary is just as bad.
thanks to all of you showing the spirit of this country. #NoFlyNoBuy #NoBillNoBreak
You still rock!
Thank you so much for you passion and action!! Never give up!
Support to control the Gun as it can affect the whole society.
@YouTube Excelente!
@maddow public has had enough of your and your colleagues ineptitude & accomplishing nothing. Can't imagine what goes on there
This isn't how our government works. Something called the Legislative process. Not a sit in like a college student.
@BarackObama lead by example then. All of you should go without armed protection for a week.
@YouTube hen all eĺ
thank you. #NoBillNoBreak
So it's ok to be obstructionists when it fits your BS politics and helps no one?
Rep Lewis, thank you so much for what you are your colleagues are doing today!
Thank you!!
.@repjohnlewis Thank you, sir. #guncontrol #gunsafety #enough
now sit right there and don't move until you are out of office. The less you DEMONcRATS do the better it is for the rest of us
You are a joke and an anachronism. Then again, you should never get involved in any substance (re: housing crisis).
keep up this courageous move.  It's so sad that it had to come to this. You are a true American hero!
@caitrionambalfe @YouTube you are the only country in the civilized world that hasn't addressed it.  #itstime
your gun control bill hasn't been brought to the floo... Oh, wait. You didn't sponsor one.
can we get a bill to stop killing babies as well?
@YouTube politicians are the dumbest people on the planet.
Thank you for standing down!
@YouTube the speaker is channeling Al Sharpton unfortunately he doesn't realize all rencent Shooters are registered Democrats!
American citizens stand with you! Thanks for speaking out for us!
Bravo my friend. 
Thanks for your courage and leadership.
@repdonnaedwards woohoo!!  Let's get it done
stay strong...! We are rooting for change! Sending my mental energy your way brave brave brave
@YouTube thanks to all of the Democrats for standing up to protect the American people on gun's Laws. #sitting on the floor.
@SenatorReid Try thumb sucking and a hashtag. Maybe cry for mommy.
@maddow thank you
@YouTube Thank you.
Thank you Sir. You are my hero forever !
You should be jailed. You just can't resist taking the law into your own hands can you? Good example for America you set.
Put a photo of murdered victims at the feet or on the seat of all rep in chamber.
Thank You. God Bless
“@repjohnlewis: My colleagues & I have had enough. We are sitting-in...until we get a vote to address gun violence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZq2F9LcUrI&feature=youtu.be …”

Today was a great day, to see John Lewis standing up to gun violence.
