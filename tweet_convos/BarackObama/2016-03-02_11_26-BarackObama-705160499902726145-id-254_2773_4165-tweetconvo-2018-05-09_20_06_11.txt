@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Why not encourage ppl to better themselves rather than say at retail or fast food job? Those are supposed to be
@WhiteHouse @timoreilly Good news if you want to hasten automation of low skilled jobs, hurt small biz & raise costs, not prosperity.
@TeglerWrites Unfortunately, the data doesn't support your ideology. @WhiteHouse is right.
@timoreilly @WhiteHouse On the contrary, numerous studies show that min wage increases are a wash. And you know it'll engender automation.
@TeglerWrites What engenders automation are compensation practices that reward CEOs when they cut labor costs to raise the stock price
@timoreilly CEOs or not, overhead is overhead - the raison d'etre for "enterprise software". Simple, inevitable logic.
@TeglerWrites Not inevitable, any more than pollution is an inevitable cost. Low wages are a negative externality paid for by society
@timoreilly Raising the min wage has no net effect. Rather like pharma, treats the symptom not the problem. Externality will be lost jobs.
@WhiteHouse yes its time to rsise minimum wage
@WhiteHouse @RepBSW thank Bernie for being the first to talk about raising the minimum wage, and continuing to #FightFor15
@WhiteHouse Yeah!!! to @BarackObama. We all need this now.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama OK now lets work on arresting & prosecuting illegal immigrants who make $250K yr hidden from IRS in landscaping.
#Oregon didn't "answer" anyone's "call" . They did it themselves because #RepublicanCongress won't act. @WhiteHouse @markwayne143
I would like to know where u and Kate Brown learned simple economics prices sky rocket when wages go up hey what a concept
@WhiteHouse @marcorubio schmemilykw
@WhiteHouse Why don't we just raise the min wage to $100 per hour? Then everyone will be wealthy. #dumb
@WhiteHouse Which means many will soon be laid off.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Raise the minimum up to the level of community sustainability without any need of government assistance. #nopoverty
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @DavidWalenski if so, proud of Oregon. Other States follow suit who have not.Employees will spend,+better economy.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama @DavidWalenski @ 75,UAW/AFL-CIO member i have been battling stagnate wages,lost jobs for yrs. Republicans not so.

@WhiteHouse @GeorgeBaileyDog $14+ in 6 years will not help. WE NEED $15 NOW!!
@marilynwinders 15 not enough...should be $20
@INCIRCLEPROMO I agree, but saying that $14 by 2020 is just not reality w/the high rent and general cost of living in Portland you need more
@WhiteHouse RT
@WhiteHouse # great idea
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama We need for Alabama to wake up. Governor of Alabama blocked the minimum wage from being raised to 10.00 an hour. – at Clarke County High School
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  across the country has been raised - they need to follow-through immediately. >S<
@WhiteHouse Private businesses should pay what the market dictates, not the government. Free enterprise anyone?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I love you
.@WhiteHouse it's time 2 let genuine free markets force wages up & prices down, not pose as people's savior while serving finance oligarchy
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama i know you have the power to stop it if not, it will get back to u and the great regions will become syria and Irak
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama  Mr President please consider Samanta's plan to stop genocide in Burundi and defend Arusha accords that u worked on
@WhiteHouse Bad news the country is bankrupt. There's nothing to do for that $15.00 an hour.
@WhiteHouse Funny you are way ahead of us in Denmark. We have no official minimum wage #FoodForThought

@WhiteHouse proud to be an Oregonian
@WhiteHouse It does not make good business sense. Any employee that was getting health insurance will now have their hours cut to part-time.

@WhiteHouse  Place No 1   BERNIE   Place No 2  HILLA
@WhiteHouse great. Doing what you can to eliminate more jobs
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama CA needs to raise it too. Every state should raise their minimum wage.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
employers can only pay what the job is worth to them.
forcing a higher min wage just makes these jobs disappear.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
raising the minimum wage just hurts those at the bottom as those jobs disappear.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama 
Oregon raised minimum wage and many restaurants closed and or let people go.
Bad idea Oregon....
Outstanding @WhiteHouse!

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama good
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how stupid. Min wage increases is working so well that in Seattle...layoffs everywhere.....
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I've got your Willie Nelson shirt waiting for you when you come to SXSW. Hit me up! You're a medium, right?
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama RT. I live in Oregon because well this is one of the reasons.There are many more reasons.Look at Oregon! We rock!
@WhiteHouse more opportunity and job growth whenever possible.
@WhiteHouse not everyone deserves the same wage but at the same time every company needs to value its employees enough to give them --
@WhiteHouse raising the minimum wage for everyone doesn't solve anything. Wage and raises should be given to those who benefit the company
@WhiteHouse @ProjectFairness still  not enough to catch up to the inflated real estate courtesy of the flippers, but it's a start.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I agree let's make it happen especially in Florida we pay so much in Miami
@WhiteHouse yes
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama still got a long way to catch up to the uk our minimum wage is amazing
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I do think minimum wage should go up, but the thing is is that minimum wage raises unemployment.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama I highly doubt the most corrupt, inept, ignorant and incompetent president in history knows what the job entails
@WhiteHouse although this is great, that is only
.25 less than what I started out as a Surgical Technologist with a 2 year degree in Ohio...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama REAGAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY GREAT ECONOMY THAT HW BUSH N CLINTON HAD. And then Democrats demands destroyed it
