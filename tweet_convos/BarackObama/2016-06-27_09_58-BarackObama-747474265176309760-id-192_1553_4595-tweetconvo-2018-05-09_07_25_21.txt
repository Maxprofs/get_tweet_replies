@nytimes 总统先生下午一般不会关心这些琐事
@nytimes China man
@VerifiedTweeter @nytimes  Cause God forbid women use protection! No Let's just use abortion as a form of birth control!
so birth control is not the answer for unwanted pregnancy? Ummm okay!!
its ok. Again prolife is gaining and one day men will be kicked out of our private lives
Obama's sole constitutional mandate is to protect our national borders.. Not social issues, education or the economy.. Fuck-up
You ever have a boss who doesn't do their job and yet has the nerve to tell you how to do yours? Thanks Barack Hussein Obama.
birth control pills do work believe it or not
@nytimes remaining states must follow texas
@nytimes The Supreme saw through the GOP strategy. That is, if they dont agree with a law, they try to reduce its intent.
@nytimes .abortion must be birth right of women!
a win for women's reproductive rights?  Seriously??  Abortion is MURDERING rights, not reproductions.  That's just sad .
@nytimes  wow the supreme court did some actual work. ..Damn lemme go buy a lotto ticket
@nytimes a so called religious man selling out values for popularity.  You will answer for this and you know it. Sad
A win for #KermitGosnell fans and a loss for health and safety of women. Sad and disgusting
@nytimes 
If killing a baby is birth control then the supreme Court are killers. Difference between birth control & abortion
@nytimes And a big plus for exterminating the unborn like they were parasites. Yes. It's murder. I'm glad you're so happy.
Ok...
@nytimes and a loss for babies!
I've never seen a bigger gap between political parties congrats prez. You suck
@nytimes why can't clinics go by the same rules as hospitals?
Dont think killing babies is women's reproductive rights
I don't believe @BarackObama is running this Twitter account. #SATAN is ! I feel like I have been #aborted today
Great decision
Thank you for being a positive example in my life even with all of the BS ^^^
God doesn't make mistakes Mr. President. The generations will look at the number of aborted fetuses how we look at slavery.
@nytimes A glass ceiling in the workplace & a leash on ur uterus..being a  isn't easy, even in America
United whe stand diffided whe fall 
The triumph of the self over the lives of others... the antithesis of the human soul.
A lose for human life...
@nytimes  hey barrack oboma i am turkish and ı you and recep tahip is friend ? [sory my english is bad]
so I guess you have enough liberals on your #SCOTUS so you can quit your crying about needing 9. @SenateGOP
well aren't we a happy person, we get to kill legally!!!  for you its "what's difference does it make now!"
Society seems to value life of defenseless animals then that of a defenseless fetus. Truly sad. Life is precious.
If a woman has an a abortion it's legal, if someone kills a pregnant woman they can be tried for double homicide? So what is it
@nytimes The government has no business telling women what they can do with their bodies, and nor does any one else !
@nytimes a loss for unborn humans. Rights 4 everyone but the unborn human. Greatest stain in American history.
you know abortion isnt going away, right? this is simply access to a safe procedure
the law enhanced the quality of the clinics thereby safety. Left prefers substandard clinics 2 any reduction in amount abortions
id argue theyve solved a problem that nobody had, abortions often require no more than a doctor and two pills
i am not an expert on abort methods but I believe there r a variety of procedures including invasive & dependent upon trimester
i believe youre right, but conforming to ER standards is overkill. you never need a hallway wide enough for two gurneys
i accept that there is always room for good faith negotiations.
i would say the only thing that connects them is that they’re good for public health
they should all celebrate by getting a cheap abortion whether they need it or not
@nytimes yall do know PO TCS does not read or write these tweets...Stop wasting your time and energy
so it's okay to murder people inside the womb???
but a loss for human life.  Liberal logic: take away guns because people die, but commit genocide against the innocent....
conservative logic: expect something to go away just because its been made illegal
no actually that's Liberal logic again.  Taking away guns will not stop mass shootings.
not giving them to the mentally compromised and convicted might be a start
no, they were voting for the no-fly list.  Anyone can be added without due process.  Did you know that MLK was on the no fly list
don’t make assumptions about my politics, i was against that act
half of our government is viciously fighting to do the wrong thing while the other half has assured us they will do nothing at all
I didn't assume anything.  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, looks like a duck....well.
@nytimes its so hotest
@nytimes MR PRESIDENT ABORTIONS DON'T ALWAYS WORK. LOOK AT YOU BARACK OBAMA THE LIVING ABORTION #NEVERCLINTON #JAILCLINTON
@nytimes WHAT ABOUT THE FATHER'S RIGHT 2 NOT HAVE HIS CHILD MURDERED #NEVERCLINTON
@nytimes WHAT ABOUT THE BABIES RIGHTS
That's another blow to the unborn Americans
Except for the rights of female fetuses.
Baby killer.
A major loss for those unborn little boys and girls. (What kind of a "father" are you?)
another win! @BarackObama
great
@nytimes Wish all these smart educated women, who demand right to abortion wud exercise more intelligence B4 getting pregnant.
#deathworshiper. Did your daughters ever worry that you'd #abort them in their sleep? Did they scream and call you a #monster?
Women must choose BEFORE! not AFTER conceiving a Baby.Real rights don't KILL people, they SAVE people.
.@BarackObama Huzzah! Surgically yanking baby parts out of a uterus DEFINITELY should be regulated less than an Uber ride.
@BarackObama
That's SO ungodly!. Are you destroying and killing Americans or trying to make them prosperous? I guess you are killing people.
you will soon go
CDC:60% of babies aborted in TX are black or Hispanic. In NYC more black babies aborted than born. Win?
sad, I hope you do value life from conception to natural death. No one has the right 2 take life. We will be answerable to God.
@nytimes
@BarackObama
@nytimes other president busy looking for good businesses opportunity obama is exploring gay,lesbianism, abortion
what ever happened to those letters/initials that identified the author of each tweet? @POTUS
@nytimes - A right is something that doesn't harm anyone. Abortion clearly does. Therefore, no such right exists.
@nytimes hello 
@nytimes OK señor Presidente Obama
Shouldn't that be non-reproductive 🛇 rights or murder in the first Tri?
@nytimes a woman's decision will ultimately be between her and her God. This country should focus on UNITY/LOVE/improve the  
.@BarackObama qui tweet l'arrêt de la Cour Suprême des US en faveur du droit à l'avortement ! #awesome  #IVG
next up all the #unconstitutional #laws restricting access to #firearms, limiting ppl's free speech and civil asset forfeiture
You mean women's birth control, or lack of reproductive rights? Horrible narrative by you as usual
@nytimes Abortion is murder. Women need to exercise their moral virtues instead of disrespect God & the souls of the innocent!!
@nytimes Trump 2016
Uuhh Mr.President it's not reproductive, abortion stops the reproductive process. Thank you
correction...
a loss not a win.
may we learn to love and respect our women.
#abortionhurtseveryone
Yes, may u learn to respect the CHOICES WE make w/our bodies & stop trying to legislate what YOU want us to do
1.Not just YOUR body.
2 bodies depending on twins etc.
The mother is genetically disconnected from her child.
@celebwhogive yes let the killings continue/
#Election2016 IS IMPORTANT. It involves SCOTUS! EVERY1 GO 2VOTE! #DontTrumpAmerica #Trexit @HFA @Bakari_Sellers @MariaTCardona
I guess the rights of the unborn humans dont count.
@nytimes 
@nytimes 
so we DON'T need to fill the vacant SCOTUS seat after all!
it is so sad that a president of United States is pushing his agenda to tear down our country and impose a type of martial law
@nytimes right on
@nytimes thank you mr president Obama!
#ha ha
It is illegal to destroy an egg, but it okay to mass murder unborn humans? #SCOTUS
Odd that enviros who see a link between earth & spotted owls cannot see the link between fetuses & babies! #SCOTUS 
#ChildMurder is how these #Witches pretend to be gods, and it is one of the reasons why #God made #Hell
Sure, because why have medical standards when you're just killing a baby
This is a win for human rights. We should be able to make decisions for ourselves & our well being.
@nytimes Just Few Days Of Ramadan Left – You Can Still Do It! http://sumo.ly/kZdX  #Ramadan #life #Pray #Islam
@nytimes yesss 
きちんと助かったか？テンノウ一族終了宣言を早くお願いします。最高裁もテンノウ一族と違法憲法が、全く国民の手に負えなくなっていました。テンノウ一族が、裁判官の資格ももっていないのに、裁判官は、全てテンノウ一族が全て操っていました。もう誰も手に負えません。
