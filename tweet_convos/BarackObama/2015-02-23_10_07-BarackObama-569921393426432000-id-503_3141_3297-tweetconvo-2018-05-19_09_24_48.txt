.@BarackObama You're the leader!
@sesiegler you are being unfair to,he needs the congress  @BarackObama
@manutd91 Lincoln was able to make it work when faced with a country divided.
@sesiegler @manutd91  u sure know your history. The South seceded because Lincoln was elected. And he was assassinated right after the war.
.@lkingincorp @manutd91 Succession was inevitable, and most people, myself included, credit Lincoln with ultimately saving the union.
@sesiegler @manutd91 secession was inevitable? Skewe

Excuse me but have you ever really studied history. Lincoln was a great president .
@lkingincorp @manutd91 The country was divided over the issue of slavery, and Lincoln being a great leader, ultimately saved the union.
@sesiegler @manutd91 the union was saved because grant won the Civil War
@BarackObama I say to you, sir, #EnoughAlready! Stop bypassing the legislative branch and making up your own laws! You are rogue President
@Richmac33 @BarackObama at least he's trying to keep us out of war not lying to us to get us into a war. And he got us out of the depression
@lkingincorp @BarackObama Funny how his "keeping us out of war" birthed ISIS and may be moving us towards another war.
@Richmac33 @BarackObama this whole thing has been birthed by Bush and his actions to go into Iraq. Which had nothing to do with 911.
@lkingincorp @BarackObama Darling that idiotic theory has been disproven time and time again but you go ahead and live in your Bush Delusion
@Richmac33 @BarackObama what you talking about weapons of mass destruction I don't think so you're the one that's delusional
@lkingincorp @BarackObama Ooooo good one! I'm sure we didn't land on the moon either!
@BarackObama You are a Liar.  America is tired of your lies.  #makeDClisten #repealobamacare #liberalsimIsCancer
@AndrewInAustin you sound like a dumb-ass. Turn of #FOXNews and #RushLimbaugh and come to terms with what helps the middle-class and poor.
@Shaunton_Davis @AndrewInAustin excellent
@lkingincorp @Shaunton_Davis Obama,  Sharpton, holder and the liberal media have divided this country and have made fools of the young.
@AndrewInAustin @lkingincorp your bigotry, and class warfare is the reason for the country's divide. #conservatives
@Shaunton_Davis @AndrewInAustin my bigotry towards whom?
@lkingincorp I was talking to @AndrewInAustin.
@Shaunton_Davis @lkingincorp take a look at your city,  destroyed by liberalism,  no jobs no hope,  just a filthy city.  #detroit
@BarackObama talk about heads stuck up their own asses. They only work 3 months as it is.
@BarackObama Let them shut it down, it won't effect you.
@BarackObama 2016 can't come fast enough.
@BarackObama Shut it down Congress. That is what we sent you to DC to do. We are tired of this clown in the White House!

@BarackObama Just raise taxes to the rich job done
@NZAircraftFan @BarackObama why not raise taxes to the poor while you are at it? Taxes are theft no matter what your annual income may be.
@LibsBeCrazy @BarackObama Taxes are not theft they part of a normal society. If you don't like taxes maybe you could move to Libya ?
@NZAircraftFan @BarackObama Taxes are very much theft. In addition, they were added under the guise of war and were then made permanent.
@LibsBeCrazy @NZAircraftFan @BarackObama  thank you Bush
@lkingincorp @LibsBeCrazy @BarackObama Yes he was the worst president in living memory.
@NZAircraftFan @lkingincorp @BarackObama He wasn't a spineless worm like our current worthless POS
@BarackObama @powerpoole #bankruptcy is what u wanted for #America quit spinning the truth #bastard
@bkd0001 @BarackObama #areyoumad LOL
@powerpoole @BarackObama no not really. Obama is a poor excuse for a leader. No full time job creator, GDP destroyer, increased spender
@BarackObama only 6 years on the job, all-time low labor participation rate, massive debt, and bloated welfare rolls.
