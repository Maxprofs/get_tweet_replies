“@BarackObama: State and local governments are taking action to #RaiseTheWage: http://ofa.bo/a14e ”
@BarackObama yes!/I'm all for it!!/thank you MR.PRESIDENT #@malikpics.com!!
@BarackObama increase wages equal pay more tax on earnings and get less on refund. Fed and State get more revenue
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Which will tank job growth. No one will hire because it's more expensive. The economy is already in the toilet
@BarackObama 
Yeah Brother! Keep trying and shall succeed. It ain't easy as many opposes good deeds because of greed.
@BarackObama good.
@BarackObama Friend, Good Day. Hope for wonder by Magician President.

@BarackObama what's with Michelle withholding the press from interviewing people. That's not ok!
@BarackObama @OFA Keynesian economics do not work. They are a ploy for power by Alinsky-ites like yourself.

@BarackObama Raise the wage so Obama can spend more tax money , wake up he has an agenda , more wages = more taxes. damn his smile
@BarackObama Doh! why did I even go to college, I could of protest for higher wage?
@BarackObama Thanks Obama for everything you do for our founding nation. You're the true American hero, sir. #salute #obamacare
@BarackObama FDR said, "No business paying less than living wages to its' workers has any right to continue in this country".

@BarackObama
@BarackObama hola
. @BarackObama You spelled "Stop the Beheading" wrong in your #RaiseTheWage hashtag.
@BarackObama How is it fair that someone who flips a burger makes $15hr when our men and women of the military don't even make that?
@BarackObama @OFA just so all the dumbasses who voted for this lazy POS understand, OBAMA is illiterate. He can't read Intel memos. #Syria
@Memfis @BarackObama @OFA I don't refer to him as a "nigger". You're suggesting I am? He has an IQ? On the bottom of his foot? Where?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @OFA I Like Obama !!! Great president!
@BarackObama y argentina
@BarackObama how good are the benefits of raising wages?
@BarackObama increase wage with education and skills. #RaiseTheWage hold yourself accountable for your income. Relying on others is weak

@BarackObama ,hi,the struge is not wage slavery vs wage providers,but greed over need,the inequality of wealth,mpathy over indifference,,,AM
@BarackObama can you help stop Stop the Slaughter horses
@BarackObama @OFA what do you think if you raised minima wage what do you think would happen to people on ssi? Think about it
@BarackObama fair wages are all well and good but what about the student loan crisis. These minimum payments are killing my wife and I...
@BarackObama @OFA if you don't like what you get paid learn a skill and get a better job. Guess it's easier to vote yourself more money.
@BarackObama Thank you for fighting for a fair living wage for American families everywhere.
@BarackObama no u cunts just talk money
@BarackObama if you minim wage what do you think that would do to people on ssi? Something to think about president Obama
@BarackObama so more ppl can get laid off and prices on goods go up...yeah lets not think of repercussions, just temporary happiness
@BarackObama @OFA And businesses are taking action to leave those jurisdictions.
@BarackObama you’re a disgrace.
