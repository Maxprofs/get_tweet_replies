@ITTRP Thank you, I didn't understand the context of the tweet.  Thank you.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS YOUR job is to represent the USA. You failed by not attending a first lady's funeral.Dont lecture us. #yuck #unamerican
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Good Luck with that. I, for one (of MANY) am so damn sick of the senate and their hateful immature agenda.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS is Obama alright?  He isn't making complete sentences. And his speech patters are jerky and segmented.
@WhiteHouse best wishes for you , Mr president ....
@WhiteHouse @POTUS wasn't on Senator Obama who advocated the same position the repubs have currently?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS story of the last 8 years. sadly senate doesnt wana see him shine at the expense of tax paying americans.
@royaltyrell516 @WhiteHouse @POTUS hard to tell if it's partisan or racism. Either way, senators should be absolutely ashamed.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS Free markets, free trade, low taxes, military interventions, how have these benefitted the US worker?
@Kluvar @WhiteHouse @POTUS they haven't but they have benefitted the rich
@WhiteHouse @POTUS but it's cool for you guys to do the same and make senate bills declaring no nominees will be appointed during lame duck
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Which could be to vote down your choice, it's called democracy.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Interesting idea, certainly an idealists way of thinking
