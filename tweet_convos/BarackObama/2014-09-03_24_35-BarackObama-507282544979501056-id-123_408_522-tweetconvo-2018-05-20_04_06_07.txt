@vj44  Per Dept of Labor statistics: 
there is a difference in woman's pay:
(If you can read the chart)
@tedscott4 @vj44 There's always been a difference in women's pay versus men. It's time to stop that completely. Same title, same pay. Fair.
@bettyspeaksout @vj44 So you agree, men need an increase? for parity
You did read the statistics, right?
@vj44 @BarackObama
@vj44 must women stay home by choice to raise their families.how can you base statistics on when for unrealistic circumstances.

@vj44 @BarackObama Americans are on welfare now than ever before! Why get a job when you can have an Obama phone eh?
@vj44 @BarackObama the best part is that the reason unemployment has dropper is because everyone has stopped looking for jobs. More

@vj44 @BarackObama good job
@vj44 @BarackObama then why allow the underlying causes to the 2007 collapse unsolved repeat itself - to scientific prove it  was real?
@vj44 @BarackObama We went to Northfield together and graduated in the same class!  I am always so amazed to see you with President Obama
@vj44 @BarackObama You're both full of crap!
@vj44 @BarackObama FACT: The government is spending $761 million to educate illegal immigrants…

@vj44 c'est la mondialisation, égalité de l' homme et la femme....
@vj44 @BarackObama >GoodnessSo many hydra-heads of #misinformation frm such nice peopleinthis #POTUS' mis-administration.Grade: E-for effort
@vj44 @BarackObama while you are busy W/random facts that aim at getting votes, our standing & security in the world is sinking. DO YOUR JOB
@vj44 @BarackObama I hate to be all "what about da menz?" but it's relevant. Our economy is slowly shedding jobs men traditionally hold.
@StickmanSouza @vj44 @BarackObama but if men lose a lot of jobs, it will narrow gap between the unemployment #'s, & Dems can get a vote or 2
@vj44 @BarackObama bullshit! Let's see the days you used to create this graph... Cuz i can make one up as well!
“@vj44: Good news: New economic trends show female short-term unemployment falling to pre-recession levels. ”
@vj44 @WhiteHouse no one is fooled. Father of man killed by illegal immigrant demands president visit son's grave http://fw.to/u3YarCg 
@vj44 @WhiteHouse I think this goes back to when they used to say why hire a man when you can hire a woman for less.
@vj44 @WhiteHouse You going to try to buy the Illinois Senate seat again?
@vj44 what about men over 50?? You all forget about this very important demographic! You always give numbers that make you look good!
@vj44 @WhiteHouse How many family men lost their jobs so you could report this?
@vj44 @WhiteHouse YEP more smoking mirrors.... Most have just given up or retired!
@vj44 Where's the labor participation rate?
@vj44 Who cares Val. Female employment is not more important than Male employment. Total employment is the goal. U know, all people working?
@vj44 @GovernorPerry So what are the stats on a left handed women with red hair and webbed feet? Nobody cares about this crap.
.@vj44 @WhiteHouse 28 weeks and counting for me. Average 8 hours a day on the job search.  Pardon me if I don't celebrate...
@vj44 @WhiteHouse Like I said, I do hope it means our economy is finally kicking back to life.
@vj44 @WhiteHouse I hope it is more ladies getting a chance in the market. But I have the feeling it is more nee by the ladies. Men leaving?
@vj44 @WhiteHouse like you really care about women. NOT.you use my gender as an election weapon.Elections coming around corner maybe?yes
@vj44 @WhiteHouse Misandrous
@vj44 @WhiteHouse Great news for the women of this country.
@vj44 Do your numbers skew the #'s as the usual reports leaving out those who've quit looking for work since no jobs found???????
@vj44 @WhiteHouse What about men? They haven't reached pre-recession employment levels.  Too bad you can't buy their votes like women.
@rnefftax but Obama has done well jealous down
@vj44 @WhiteHouse Or women and men throwing the white flag on their marriage is getting much more of a problem in the USA. Single Moms!
@vj44 @WhiteHouse like this news
@vj44 When "women succeed" and "unemployment" are used in same sentence announcing "good news"
#EconomyStinks
@RightGlockMom @vj44 I succeeded for 40 years in the work force. Prices are way too high, but economy improving.
.@vj44 Does that unemployment data include those who dropped out of the workforce altogether?
“@bhweingarten: .@vj44 Does that unemployment data include those who dropped out of the workforce altogether?” Due to Disability or Death?
