@WhiteHouse @BarackObama http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/obama-ready-ramp-ebola-airport-screening-n219811 … blocking flights from Ebola areas would 'make countries poorer'? What a bullshit excuse.

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama #KobaneİcinSokağa #SaveKobane
@WhiteHouse   To earn more you need to increase your skills.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama higher minimum wage= higher costs for everything= middle income families are poorer...
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama THE MOST SECRETIVE ADMINISTRATION IN YEARS!
TRANSPARENCY BREEDS INTEGRITY
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama how can one body of people govern another without being of the same status as those who are governed.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama , interesting stories, not supported by real issues that apply to raises, increased prices, loss of jobs will occur
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama alright if congress won't raise the minimum wage they need to take a pay cut.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama great!!  We have dollar 80 per month as minimum wages in India,  hope we can improve here also..  Good luck anyways
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama You can't rent a room and buy food on $7.25 an hour...

, @WhiteHouse or we could all work harder and educate ourselves to avoid the govt from ruling our every move #NothingShouldBeFree
@WhiteHouse You should stop ignoring stories, from across America, about how government intrusion has ruined our lives...
@WhiteHouse How about some stories from small businesses that would have to fire staff, delay hiring, close the business, or never start.
@WhiteHouse A responsible adult would raise one's self (skills, habits, knowledge), not make others change for them. #NoTo#RaiseTheWage
@WhiteHouse How about we talk to some small business owners & discover how they plan to pay for it...by laying people off or raising prices!
@WhiteHouse RAISE MINIMUM WAGE! AMERICA...EACH STATE DESERVES TO GET MINIMUM WAGE RAISED. it will be good for the economy
@WhiteHouse did you also include stories from businesses that will be forced to raise prices to cover the costs of raising the minimum wage.
@WhiteHouse Quit acting like y'all actually help people
@WhiteHouse 
I want to
Hear
Stories about how
Broken windows boost
The economy
Need a 
Keynesian fix!
@WhiteHouse what is the minimum wage? It's one way of reducing people's life style. What about a living wage
@WhiteHouse continued assault on small businesses. Stop please.
@WhiteHouse ...and they all said it would help you because they promised to vote Dem if you did it? #BIYINGVOTES
@WhiteHouse divide the military budget+( isreali foreign aid LOL) by the No of US citizens, better spent at home..
@WhiteHouse Yea, it will help with the skyrocketing health care costs.. Go figure.
@WhiteHouse abolishing the income tax would give minimum wage earners an instant increase.
@WhiteHouse How does this help those just above minimum wage?
@WhiteHouse AAaa
@WhiteHouse Raise minimum to $500,000/hour. Then everyone wd be millionaires by lunchtime 1st day working at McDonald's, retire at age 19!
@WhiteHouse abolish income tax and let U.S.citizens keep their money.
@WhiteHouse all of which are paid to support the argument; either that or they're too stupid to know what will really happen.
@WhiteHouse My company couldn't afford to keep me hired after M.W. went up. It helped me realize I was expendable.  Thanks, Pres. Obama!
@WhiteHouse yeah!
