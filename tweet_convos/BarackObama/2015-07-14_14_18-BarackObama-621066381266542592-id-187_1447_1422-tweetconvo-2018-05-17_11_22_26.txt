@BarackObama Yeah because someone in office somewhere realized they could make money using the prison systems.
@BarackObama I know I'm not from the past but people have lost their ideals/standards along with morals like we used to have..
@BarackObama @jfmartinezr cual sería total si se sumaran lo que al día de hoy sus condenas no terminaron de cumplir porque fueron deportados

@BarackObama @LaffertyDaniel6 40% increase in population vs .4% increase in incarceration between 1980 and 2014 in US. Need % not quantity
@BarackObama @ShaunKing Are you bragging of this "accomplishment"?

@BarackObama @blvarga Had a friend who was innocent faced w/2 yrs but if he lost in court he'd get 10.He took the 2 yrs.Poor ppl=no justice
@BarackObama Blame it on the Custodial Officer Unions, the sheriff's unions for county jails where most of them are incarcerated
@BarackObama @tanyaj6777 why are we trying to control the population?
@BarackObama The increasing incarceration rate is another bad idea for which we can thank Reagan and conservatives
@BarackObama @ChasParnell because we don't punish stupidity properly.  Our parents are bound by laws to prevent discipline.
@BarackObama building jails is a franchise like McDonald's in USA, same as Healthcare, but can't build unless fill them. @jdbalart
@BarackObama this reflects the impact of life/country altering, mandatory sentencing, that held bipartisan support in the 80's and 90's.

@BarackObama so Mr president are you criticising modern society? ? You sure have more power than any other politician to change things.
@BarackObama why don't you create a tunnel network under the ocean dug by those inmates. Give them an opportunity to make their own society
@BarackObama there own society thats separate from ours. They would create their own laws and therefore respect the need for law and order.
@BarackObama A good thing or a bad thing????  Confused here
@BarackObama in Spain 4 Bares por cada 3 personas
@BarackObama  that is the consequences of rejecting God in our daily lives and decisions. Very soon all American will be in prison.

@edgeoforever @BarackObama it's a bad thing and Varack wants to improve those numbers.
@BarackObama in 1980 people had more money and had more freedom. As this changed, crime took over. The war on drugs is lost. Legalize it.
@BarackObama Dear President, send them in Italy and a lot of them will be free soon...
