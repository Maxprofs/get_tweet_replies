@jroberts52066 @UpInTheHills @BarackObama -I laugh,sadly, at ANYONE who thinks THIS president doesn't "receive accolades"! YOU are the joke!
@BarackObama do you have a toddler doing your stats or are you just tossing out random fun facts that are actually misleading lies
@BarackObama my rate is going up 35%. Sound right to you?
Mr. President @BarackObama #SmallBusiness health insurance premiums are increasing at an alarming rate. Renewals are up 50%.
@BarackObama What can America expect from a President who tied the lowest score on record for College Special Ed Graduates?Listen to Him!!
@BarackObama So then?Unemployment #'s & Rate #'s!50 Mill on Tax Payers Payrolls costing Trillions & Deficit are tied for Highest on Record?
@BarackObama 176 Million are w/o Jobs!Unemployment rate is 36.8%!50 Million are on Tax Payers Payrolls!Deficit is 10's of not 100 Trillion!!
@BarackObama You're a Damn Liar!
@BarackObama Except mine increased 25% last year and is expected to rise that much or more this year.
@BarackObama This maybe true, but deductibles have shot through the roof.
@NC5_MBellinger @BarackObama   How high?
@democatsanddogs @BarackObama I assume you're asking about deductibles. I pd $1300 last year with a higher premium & $2500 the year before.
@BarackObama Stop the flights from Africa into USA &  deal with ISIS Lower taxes
@BarackObama Unfortunately mine has not.  it has gone up another 25% with increased ded.  Doesn't make sense since drs keep getting dinged.
@BarackObama Then how do you explain $425 a month for the cheapest no frills policy I could find for myself, and $6,000 a year deductibles?
“@BarackObama: "Premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record." -- > While our taxes are the highest on record of any country?
@BarackObama 124.
They didn't go down $2400? “@BarackObama: "Premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record." —President Obama #AmericaLeads”
@BarackObama organiZing for America strikes again!
@BarackObama I don't know about y'all, but my rates have gone up every year for the last 5 years.
When you can figure out how to lock your front door, then you get to lecture us about FNC you moron. @BarackObama
@BarackObama bc peoples' plans are changing to avoid Cadillac tax
@BarackObama Don't you remember saying family premiums would #Fall $2500. Truly #Despicable.
.@BarackObama can you show a report that reflects this statement about #premiums?  Outrageous when #ACA isn't totally implemented.@FoxNews
@BarackObama  
First, where? 
Second, I'm still waiting for mine to drop as promised.
.@BarackObama What ever happened to that $2,500/family per year savings that you promised to sell the ACA?
@BarackObama "Premiums are rising"

Yep, they sure are. First true thing you've said in years.
@BarackObama stop spamming my feed loser.
@BarackObama if you really look around you wouldn't be on tweeter blowing your own horn, then again it's you the american liar
@BarackObama Really? premiums increased at least 50% and you call that affordable?
@BarackObama Really? Just got notice my premium will increase 23% in Jan +$1000 deductible increase. It increased 10% last yr Pay raise zero
@BarackObama what abput huge deductibles that no one can afford?
@BarackObama co-pays are up deductibles are up and the programs are less And you consider this success
@BarackObama but they are still rising, which is the root of the problem, is it not?
@BarackObama Don't rely on insurance premiums as measure of success, but include total out-of-pocket costs (i.e. co-pays, donut holes, etc).
@BarackObama That is because tax payers are making up the diff and deductible's are higher and coverage sucks
“@BarackObama: "Premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record." —President Obama #AmericaLeads” complete crap. At least in TX
@BarackObama bullshit. At least in Texas
@BarackObama my premium went up 26% after obamacare happened. I pay $1,229 a month.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama lowest on record since u took office? Or since u forced that shit on us? #nothingupmysleeve
@BarackObama Premiums which more than trippled from last year, that is on par with the lowest premium rise rate on record? I call BS! #OFA
@BarackObama Yes becuse they have increased by 5-10x for many working americans.
@BarackObama Dear Mr. President, guess you have heard: "Never trust statistics you didn't fake yourself." 
Healthcare has work left to do..!
Excellent use of the second derivative, Mr President. RT @BarackObama: Premiums are rising at a rate tied for the lowest on record.
