Now we all pay more and will be paying a lot more next year for less coverage this is socialism in action
That might be for the fact that women use it more as cost insurance co.s more outlay. Just like auto insur. lots of use costs
@OFA now everyone gets charged high rates for health insurance (insurance ≠ care) so you have less buying power in the economy.
@OFA the good ole days
@OFA Right now men are still being charged more for car insurance for being men. You should address that issue also.
@OFA women use medical facilities and/or procedures much more than men do. why shouldn't they pay more for that? #BasicMath
