@BarackObama We are also the last free country that was a republic. I guess you want to get rid of that. #SOTU
@oktomcat lol you know most other countries have constitutions as well. @BarackObama
@OldContrarian I have been to many of them too. Not a true republic. @BarackObama
@oktomcat give me the criteria for a true republic. :D @BarackObama
@OldContrarian Following laws that limit government. Government can't change that law without states say so. @BarackObama
@oktomcat that principle alot of democracys have that. Even non republik countrys. @BarackObama
@OldContrarian Democracy doesn't follow laws. A democracy is when the people makes any law they want at a whim. Democracies never last long.
@BarackObama @johnnysockz probably not that advanced then?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama @adam_zander 
that's manifest destiny American style
@BarackObama If you require paid maternity leave you'll cause a gender bias
Employers will to hesitate to hire females:same price, less work
@AlexLady really? Then explain why MORE women are working in countries with mandatory paid maternity leave.
@AlexLady but if you're really worried this would hurt female hiring prospects, there's an obvious answer: mandate paid paternity leave too.
@BarackObama North of the border we get a year of paid parental leave for the parents to split. Try to match that or do better.

@BarackObama Have you seen what socialism has done to Greece, Ireland etc.

@daniellewarren @BarackObama wtf! No sick leave or maternity leave? Seriously?
@kernos1 it’s up to the employer. There’s no standard or minimum. It’s fucked up!
@daniellewarren it is, sadly our govt is trying to turn us into you but I didn't realise it was that bad
@kernos1 yep. It sucks. Makes me not want to have kids here tbh.
@BarackObama @chief_shakur Because we are not going to pay you to go get knocked up. C'mon man, its called planning.
@BarackObama @teganandsara 
Another habit of unsuccessful countries!
@BarackObama Even poor country like Ethiopia provides three months paid maternity leave, why can't the richest country on earth couldn't?
@BarackObama @JoshBBornstein IPA & Abbott would like Oz to join USA on that list of advanced countries without some hard won conditions
@BarackObama Maternity leave is 4 months with Full Pay for some. While the rest is 70%of your salary.
@BarackObama Great job. You proved to be your people's President.
@BarackObama finally #PresidentObama speaks out on #maternityleave issues. For those who think this leave is not required, think abt ur kids
@BarackObama not true, especially if you are referring to hourly employees
@BarackObama in Kenya, we go for 2 weeks paid paternity leave! Thats Kenya 1-0 USA! @StandardKenya @ntvkenya @CitizenTVNews @calestous
