@alyjonas @BarackObama And I'm sure referring to bed makers and apple pickets warmed the hear of my Latino friends.
"Latinos are NOT defined by those jobs" <--Who wants to tell Obama?
@alyjonas @ScotsFyre @BarackObama
Clearly not @SeahawkBurrrton ==> @alyjonas @BarackObama She's fine with it.
@alyjonas I'm sure your paper will be riveting. Touch base when you are employed, successful and your wages are redistributed at a high rate
@BarackObama  no offense but that sounds like  you know raceist
@BarackObama Not!
@BarackObama Yes, an American issue. Not for illegals to decide!
@BarackObama This is only an American issue if they are legal American's.
@BarackObama it was way better before you came into office.
@BarackObama Yes it is. REAL issue is that, if they are here illegally,  they should be deported IMMEDIATELY  irregardless of curcumstances!
“@BarackObama: “This is not just a Latino issue. This is an American issue.” —President Obama #ImmigrationAction” 
@BarackObama Advocates like Rep. Guittierez (D, Ill) only advocate for Latinos. His crew always say, "Latinos and immigrants." UnAmerican.
@BarackObama if you're so into "helping" people. Why don't you start off by helping the ones who actually need it?Like India?Belgiam?Africa?
@BarackObama AND you're giving them free health insurance. FREE EVERYTHING. And us Americans HAVE to pay for all of the #Immigrants bullshit
@BarackObama its the fucking LATINO ISSUE!!! You can't just give them work permits for NOT DOING SHIT!! Plus, giving them homes so on so on
@BarackObama but it's mainly a Latino issue--the signs in California are in Spanish, not Korean or Tagalog.
@BarackObama To many Armed Forces have fought and died for you to give away what they protect! An illegal act for Illegals is not American!
@BarackObama. Thank you. No one could be as strong as you. We've needed you for years!!
@BarackObama people who are staying for 20 yrs without status.what happens to them.obamas executive  order has not addressed this issues
@BarackObama @mishalobama #SaveDonbassPeoplefromUkrainianArmy 
#fascist #junta #genocide #Obama #StopObama
@BarackObama "it's not a Ferguson issue it's an America issue". Which he's wrong about. Racism exists everywhere but MB caused his death.
@Barackobama this is not just a Latino issue,  this is an American issue, and I love you dear President!
@BarackObama What about the native people M. Obama?
@BarackObama
@BarackObama How would you know?!
@BarackObama if they are not here legally send them back to where they came from no anchor baby's no nothing unless you pass testing!
@BarackObama oi TB sou do Basil e o senhkr
@BarackObama I highly disapprove of your decision. Why don't you get deported back to where you came from.

@BarackObama stress often that it includes illegals from other countries, I.e., Canada, Croatia, Germany, Poland, China, etc.
@BarackObama Actually its a Democratic Party issue. 5 million more voters. Thanks for playing though.
@BarackObama this is not a American issue. This is a issue of people illegally entering our county and you "Obama" not enforcing current law
@BarackObama Gracias Obama ya mi hermana podra visitarnos en Mexico.
