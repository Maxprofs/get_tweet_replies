@BarackObama Carbon is not a pollutant.
@BarackObama @Al_Gorelioni Don't know much about climate deniers but I do know about a Socialist who refuses to follow the Constitution.
Or stick it to @BarackObama by refusing to forget the man made climate change fraud evidence @Al_Gorelioni

@BarackObama this is all bullcrap just like all Obama has told. Keep you doctor, keep you climate. Start with China first
@BarackObama @USABillOfRights So uniting..."stick it to your fellow countrymen" & give me more power. THAT should be offensive even to Dems.
@BarackObama Panic Pollution is a much bigger problem. After ISIS, Obamacare, and the unemployment rate. Your eco-theology is bankrupt.
@BarackObama  I worked at NOAA / NGDC on remote sensing, satellite data collection. We need to un-stick your idiotic panic-pimping.
@BarackObama Stick it to 'em?  Kind of like the Aztecs did to those sacrificed in the name of a prolonged drought?

MT “@BarackObama: ...fight against climate change—stick it to climate change deniers by adding your name”- He's a uniter not divider, y'all.
@BobbiJoR One would think @BarackObama would be able to forget about 'global warming' long enough to fight real threats. Like Ebola. Or ISIS
@Reformed3forms @BarackObama Just saw photo of an ISIS fighter holding up the head of a woman fighter he killed. Ugh. Appalling.
@BarackObama Ebola, ISIS, other world crisis. You're focused on climate change. Keep up the good work Mr President!  #FailedPresidency
