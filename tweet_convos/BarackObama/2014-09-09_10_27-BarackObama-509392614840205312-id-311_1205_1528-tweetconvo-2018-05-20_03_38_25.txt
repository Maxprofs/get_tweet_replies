@Ra_Lee_Cooper Thanks for clarifying. I got confused after so many US presidents intervened so openly in Central Am, incl. @BarackObama
@albertofdez73 @BarackObama well I'll remind you again United States. Talk to Juan Hernandez or Luis Solis they'll handle this issues.
@Ra_Lee_Cooper I'll remind you again: thank you! You're really useful.
@albertofdez73 I know I am! Anytime! That's not the U.S. problem.
@Ra_Lee_Cooper except it is, no matter how much you try to ignore it
@albertofdez73 there's presidents in Central America....go talk to them on twitter.
