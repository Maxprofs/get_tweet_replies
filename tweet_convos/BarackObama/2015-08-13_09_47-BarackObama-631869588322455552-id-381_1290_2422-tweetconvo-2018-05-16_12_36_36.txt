@BarackObama Why not go visit the fine work done by his EPA?
@BarackObama What about the current mess in CO, NM, UT?
That's a bigger deal right now. Unless you don't really care about the environment.
@BarackObama I thought the Frontline was in southern Colorado where the EPA just poisoned an entire river system with toxic heavy metals.
@BarackObama to spew carbon emissions from 4 large turbo fan engines, & maybe, just maybe, chop up a bald eagle or 2.
So, fly major fuel burning AF1 right past EPA polluted CO on the way to Alaska to BS about GW/CC scam! @BarackObama #Jackass

@BarackObama we need solution to the Climate change
@BarackObama  how about going to Colorado and inspecting the damage YOUR EPA caused?
@BarackObama No rush on that major river system the EPA polluted or anything. I'm sure it'll still be full of arsenic/lead when you return.
@LennyGhoul @BarackObama  Maybe Air Force One will fly over the river.
@BarackObama bravo
@BarackObama Thank you Sir for being the kind of president we need
.@BarackObama it's the only front lines he'll ever have the intestinal fortitude to fight on
.@BarackObama Thought youd be taking your van down to the river to survey the long lasting damage your EPA has done to that environment.
.@BarackObama What kind of damage is firing up AF1 & its accessories going to do to the climate? So you fight climate change by making more?
@BarackObama It's not orange, guess the EPA hasn't worked its magic yet.
