Based on what, @Wonderwon? Hooker's study retracted: http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2014/10/brian-hookers-paper-on-increased-risk.html … @BarackObama
@tweek75 @BarackObama  Dr. Thompson's own statement.  When will there be actual studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated children?
Prospective randomized controlled study or retrospective study? @Wonderwon @BarackObama
@tweek75 @BarackObama  A retrospective study would be a great place to start. Plenty of vaccinated/unvaccinated children's health records
Retrospective ones have been done. They found no link b/t vaccines and autism or other diseases attributed to them. @Wonderwon @BarackObama

“@BarackObama: "I’m setting a new goal: By the end of this decade, let’s enroll six million children in high-quality preschool."

Thoughts?
@twrightministry @BarackObama Everything he says sounds good in theory. By "high quality" he's really saying, "government controlled."
@stacihogan @BarackObama exactly.
@BarackObama you need to get your acts right and save #Kobane bro. Get your #US armed #ISIS mofos out of #Kobani now

How about we strive for high quality K-12 schools first? @BarackObama
@SoquelCreek random, ambiguous metrics and benchmarks are the best kind.
@zarkinfrood How about having public schools in the USA's most-populous state that don't rank near the bottom?

@BarackObama I trusted you will make it as president. I am still optimistic. Keep doing the best. But help restore #world peace.

@BarackObama One must have courage to accept truth that Heaven,Hell,Ghosts,Miracles,DayOfJudgement,Soul,Rebirth,GOD do not exist. Buddha had
@BarackObama Gud...
@BarackObama We are just throwing money out there but half of them are not doing anything but charging the parents a lot of money on things.
@BarackObama Just preschool they all need a education and collage should be free. one thing we do need is smarter people.
@BarackObama When will Nigeria see Education as the best gift to every Child? i pray God to lift me up so that i will b able to giv my best.

@BarackObama @RazAthman What happened to your goal of closing guantanamo?
@BarackObama HOW ABOUT IMPROVING THE JOB MARKET SO MOMS DON'T HAVE TO WORK AND CAN CARE FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN? OR DOES IT TAKE A VILLAGE?
@BarackObama too many tweets #mute
@BarackObama how?
@BarackObama I have my masters in education with a 4.0 GPA and I'm a great preschool teacher yet I can not find a job. Willing to relocate
@BarackObama   I think that pre-school will help them interact with other children and not consume soo much television.
@BarackObama Thankfully, you won't be in that long!
@BarackObama you're are great example of what is a parent and a teacher. Thank you, Mr President. Mettas

@BarackObama: "By the end of this decade, let’s enroll six million children in high-quality preschool."
@BarackObama Let's focus on more important things that FUCKING TODDLERS.
@BarackObama Don't understand. WHO THE HELL DOES THAT HELP!?!?
@BarackObama SIX Million sounds like the number of #Illegal children you've brought into America #tcot #tlot #Ccot
@BarackObama where r these high quality pre schools. They are all turning out to be money minting machines. Who cares for educational needs.
@BarackObama They are the future.
.@BarackObama .@StarCoreOne02 Could we set a goal to get 6 million kids out of the crappy schools in Dem-run cities instead?
@BarackObama @2healnow   how about 6 million more, just 7 miles INSIDE Mexico in great schools with housing as a cultural staging area too?
.@BarackObama wants to indoctrinate pre-school children with his #CommonCore anti-American propaganda.
@BarackObama I'm a preschool teacher...you will need the salaries to go up if you want high-quality. #jobs
@BarackObama there ya go... better education. Maybe the new generation children will be well educated
@BarackObama And what will this cost? Another bill we can't afford :(
@BarackObama how bout 6 million kids in college
@BarackObama That's why I homeschool. Young children belong at home.
@BarackObama n kill others kids is also a part of ur new goal.... u filthy pig
@BarackObama screw the pre-schoolers
@BarackObama you just want everyone to go to school so we will always owe the govt $ from our loans... Let's do something bout THAT future
@BarackObama And who's going to pay for this? Raising taxes even further....
@BarackObama how to pay for high quality daycare. Great idea. Long overdue.
@BarackObama there's young children who don't even have a placement in THEIR OWN SCHOOL DISTRICT IN NEWARK and #AmericaLeads? Yeah right..
@BarackObama @obyezeks That is, in a serious nation.
@BarackObama 
the goal I was hoping for was repeal AFA and all the tax increases
RT @BarackObama: "I’m setting a new goal: By the end of this decade, let’s enroll six million children in high-quality preschool."
@BarackObama "by the end of this decade"? You won't be in office unless you have an executive order ready to eliminate term limitations too.
@BarackObama Is it @narendramodi's influence? @anilkohli54 @mediacrooks
"I’m setting a new goal: By the end of this decade, let’s enroll six million children in high-quality preschool." —President Obama
@BarackObama @Astorix23 High-quality!--with funding for low-income families.  Also, preschool all dayl is not appropriate for that age.
@BarackObama Now you talking, Mr.  President! 
@BarackObama Vai ter guerea
@BarackObama  ur administration is a joke sincerely all Americans who have lost their mind
@BarackObama kids don't need pre-school I and millions like me did pretty well without pre-school
@BarackObama how will you achieve this goal when you are no longer in office?
@BarackObama f u DUMBASS
@BarackObama
@BarackObama that's a start. Children r the future, but we need bigger goals. Let's tlk abt tht outrageous gas tax thts abt 2 take effect!
@BarackObama thanks Barack it's for you the victory against PAOK, Guingamp the best team #EAGPAOK #Guingamp #EuropaLeague
@BarackObama please explain this to @dcsdk12 , Koch reforms aren't the answer
@BarackObama  is that immigrants or American children????
@martinbud legal citizens only. If the immigrants are legal they should get the benefits too
@gscottsanders parents should figure it out... Can't have everything handed to them. Maybe with higher min wage it will be easier?
@gscottsanders hopefully the high-quality preschool provides buses but I don't see how the gov't can help you out with that one..
@BarackObama Mr president Obama you are real hero
Did volunteer work in '60's,at preschool school. run by govern  Sorry to say, most Teachers not  educated..@BarackObama
@BarackObama Дети - беспроигрышная тема, когда в остальных сплошное фиаско.
@BarackObama first, you have to get capable teachers, then resources for the schools,  without that you can't offer anything to our children
@BarackObama Who's paying for that Preschool? You'd be better off sending their parents to school!
@BarackObama where, in #Syria?
@BarackObama Fortunately, it will not be your concern. I doubt that Americans have somewhere else elected.
@BarackObama GREAT, LET THEM LIVE TOO ¡¡¡
@BarackObama @shf71888 Presschool? Getting kids who are in HS into higher education so young ones have something 2 look up 2 is what we need
@djphinesse I agree!
@BarackObama #EarlyChildhood learning is key - so we start at age 3 with art, literacy and leadership development
@BarackObama I am assuming you mean six million previously unenrolled children
Let the good work begin with u, Mr. "Visionary" @BarackObama . Shubh kaam mein deri kaisi? Lead from d front, dese "ATLEAST" 6 million kids.
@BarackObama Are you kidding??
@BarackObama And keep gangster corporations plundering the earth and lives. Control over everything.
@BarackObama at what cost? It will cost me $600 to enroll my child into preschool but yet we make to much to qualify for assurance
@BarackObama so many other issues and your worried about pre schools haha!  You are so jerked off @jaymon10002  @Stewball83
@BarackObama Children benefit more from quality with there parents.  It is sad that preschool has become necessary
@BarackObama or how about instead of of worrying about preschool we set a goal to drive down higher education costs you worthless cunt
@BarackObama They might also accuse you of attempting to Eradicate Republican ideals by spreading quality education.
“@BarackObama: "I’m setting a new goal: By the end of this decade, let’s enroll six million children in high-quality preschool." #LOL
@BarackObama Yeah, we are going to need help with that. Preschool cost as much as my mortgage.
@BarackObama but how do we afford high quality prek when day care alone is expensive
@BarackObama Get NASA to build a Death Star instead please. #taxpayersmoneywellspent

.@BarackObama 6mil in high-quality preschool is great a goal! Also need goals for specialized programs & inclusion for #disabled children!

@BarackObama I Would Like to Appreciate this Step Mr, Obama
@BarackObama I love it. Sounds like a great idea.
@BarackObama lying cunt
@BarackObama  brilliant
@BarackObama can we arrest Darren Wilson while we're at it?
@KeepItTricky @BarackObama and Rush Limbaugh too?
@therealjdizzle no, let's start with the murderers first.
@KeepItTricky I don't see why we can't do both? Hate speech is just as brutal.
@therealjdizzle freedom of speech dude, even if it's retarded.
@KeepItTricky yes but hate speech isn't protected especially if it's inciting acts of violence which is definitely the case
@therealjdizzle Darren Wilson's indictment is far more of a threat to our freedom than anything Rush Limbaugh has to say.
@therealjdizzle or lack of indictment for that matter.
@BarackObama You know you're a boss when you quote yourself
