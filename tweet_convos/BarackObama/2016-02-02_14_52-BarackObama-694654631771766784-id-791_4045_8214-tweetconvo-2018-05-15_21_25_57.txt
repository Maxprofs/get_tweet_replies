@BarackObama All Americans should recite the Lord's prayer at least once a day and ask God for wisdom.
@BarackObama That is the Republican way of running America. Protect the and damn the poor.Is that the kind of health service we want ?
@BarackObama I wish Congress would put as much energy into legislating reparations to descendants of Africans enslaved in the U.S.
@BarackObama Yes, time to start using resources from these wasted attempts at repeal toward important job of care for the American people!
@BarackObama This makes no sense.
@BarackObama Because people don't want to pay for outrageous premiums from ObamaCare. They'll then have the right to choose.
@BarackObama @roze_hurd Isn't 22 million the same number as is still uninsured because you didn't push for Single Payer?
@BarackObama it's time to move on and stop wasting tax payers money!  This is why we need to vote for people who will move us forward

@BarackObama  Know reason repeal of Obamacare failed. Two Reps, Kirk of Illinois and Collins/Maine voted with Dems.
@BarackObama "Professor" POTUS: Please review the unfathomable substitution (gutting) of House originated rev. Bill into ACA fiat.
@BarackObama "Professor" POTUS it is called Constitutional procedure to follow through with Congressional desire to override your veto!
@BarackObama no it won't people can't afford the high deductible that they have before they can be treated

@BarackObama love the idea ..but did it really work? my health  insurance pram quadrupled Dec 1st : (
@BarackObama Who cares? It's better than your idea of affordable healthcare.
@BarackObama ridículous
@BarackObama I can only say one thing. his year premium is much higher. I hv to pay it anyway. Otherwise, I get penalized. Is it fair Mr. O?
@BarackObama Fact?  How can cancelling a largely subsidized program increase the debt?  How many insureds had their policies cancelled?
@BarackObama Obamacare will be history in about 18 months.  How many insurance companies have gone broke since the onset of this namesake?
@BarackObama Stay strong! I wish I could have met you 4 or 8 yrs ago. Moved to IA 8/15. Pls read my 2/1/16 blog post if you get a chance
@BarackObama bunch of twits
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Can't believe they won't quit beating this dead horse, still making same old claims, long since debunked, & finding believers.
@BarackObama
Because of the ACA my family was able to buy insurance. No more excessive premiums or pre-existing condition denials. Thank U @BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama
@BarackObama Maybe because it is trash. You made those who had insurance lose it, and those whom didn't now do. Bravo.
@BarackObama higher premiums, higher drug costs, where is the affordability you promised? Another of your failures.

@BarackObama  I am Bangladeshi how are you
@BarackObama such a crock of bull crap
@BarackObama I work 45hrs a week & will not pay 200 a month for ins. w/a 5000 deductible so that I can pay 60 to got to a Dr when I get sick
@BarackObama pardon my French, but bullsh*t
.@BarackObama The savings are easy to see when you compare cost trends between the last 7 years and the prior 7.
= )
@BarackObama why would anyone but social misfits, idiots, and sociopaths vote for a Republican for anything?
@BarackObama @DrPanMD for those of us who already have insurance it's not doing what you said. My rates keep going up and up...
@BarackObama your illegal tax and force place health insurance should not be relied upon to pay for reckless spending by fed govt #Obamacare
@BarackObama my vote will go to anyone who will repeal #Obamacare until it is gone. Maybe insurance costs will come down again.
@BarackObama increase the fed deficit? You mean to say keep tax payers' money where it belongs. In our pockets. Stop spending too much!
@BarackObama they act like you can't Add!! 
@BarackObama just because your propaganda machine labels it a fact doesn't mean it is a fact. Shove it up your ass.
@BarackObama and what do you think you are doing with #guncontrol? You constantly attempt to restrict 2A against the will of majority.
@BarackObama that is because the majority of Americans hate it.  It takes away our choices.  It is a power grab by our government.
@BarackObama I am with you, Mr. President.
@BarackObama I think the #Obamacare is a laudable coverage.
@BarackObama What is sad to me is, I pay over $500 a month for health care thru my employer and it still cost me $220 to go to the doctor!
@BarackObama  hello
@BarackObama Sometimes losers cant stand losing.
@BarackObama healthcare should be free at the point of contact for everyone. It should be a basic right for all
@BarackObama That's because it's the best thing to do.
@BarackObama Guess what; you LIED about it. It doesn't work & they BETTER NOT STOP TRYING to dump this crap. U were PITIFUL, lying. PITIFUL
@BarackObama Ohh Barack Obama
@BarackObama #USAkillYemenis
@BarackObama Yes, because you made sure of it with this ignorant law.
@BarackObama And rightfully so. 0bummerCare a disaster. Government should NOT be involved in health care. #PrivateSector
@BarackObama
@BarackObama  deduct $8000  $1,800 a month?  Dr not in network sons asthma med $430/month why is this considered Affordable? You failed
@BarackObama ultimately you will not succeed. You can judge a man by his fruit. Reap what you sow. #it's over
@BarackObama 
Ya because it sucks !!! How are you going to tax middle class Americans 695 per family member for not having YOUR healthcare
@BarackObama Yemen: 10 months of war. 100,000s civilians homeless due to the US-backed Saudi-led airstrikes #USAkillYemenis
