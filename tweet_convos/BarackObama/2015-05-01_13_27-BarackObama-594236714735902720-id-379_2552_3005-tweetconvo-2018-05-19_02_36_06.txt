@BarackObama Why diversity matters in the teaching force?
@redefimposible @WeAreTeachers  @Teachers_Unite
@BarackObama @bridgelitgap1 - This is why teachers deserve better health insurance rates, better maternity programs and infant care help.
@BarackObama   Totally agree with you Mr. President, but we must not forget that parents are also there to educate as it proper.
@BarackObama OF COURSE, TEACHERS ARE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PROFESSIONALS IN EVERY COUTRY, HUGS FROM CHILE TO YOUR NATION!

@flotusgood afternoon Mr.President and First Lady
@BarackObama . Parents must imperatively contribute to this education, the teachers can not do it alone! Forgive me if my English is poor.
@BarackObama These same children who prefer to spend their time watching television or playing with their tablet rather than reading a book.
@BarackObama Check out this great blog about how success in school starts with respecting the teacher.  http://www.bordaslaw.com/?t=40&an=39478&format=xml&p=7076 …
