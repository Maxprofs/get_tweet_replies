@BarackObama what you have done is a slap in the face to everyone who immigrated legally and a slap in the face to democracy.
@camrensblood @BarackObama why do you want Mr president to do it at least ask lil Wayne,dre or eminem omg this girl
@BarackObama You cannot begin to control this until our borders are closed tight..you are as dumb as you look...or have no common sense
@BarackObama I feel if they come over here they should have to pay taxes just like we do I don't care how long they are here for we have
@BarackObama The only thing broken about our immigration is the lack of border security. Send Troops now! And build an electric fence.
@BarackObama   Mr President now do the same with the so called "mighty gun lobby" and save the lives of innocent children. They are not Gods
@BarackObama - Unconstitutional Dictatorial and Divisive
@BarackObama what should be done is open the borders both ways and rehash out job's making a way for 2 stronger governments to grow.
@BarackObama 
okay sir
We should've elected a king a long time ago! “@BarackObama: Our immigration system has been broken for a very long time & everyone knows it"
@BarackObama is there any hope to bring the people of the world on one platform for a single world government
@BarackObama This country was founded by immigrants... What now, we don't have enough space left? No.
@BarackObama We have space.
@BarackObama, immigration system has  been forgotten for long time. I don't know why

@BarackObama so instead of fixing it let's let anyone in and give them free shit. While Americans are left with nothing
@BarackObama to put facts in the mix of things are we talking about one society or all. I think people should go back to 2000 and read.
@BarackObama I wonder how this topic on immigration came to be. When no one cared about it before the years of 2000-2007.
@BarackObama  like.......
@BarackObama yeah, it's been broken because there isn't enough being done to keep illegals out.
@BarackObama because the laws were not enforced by ...wait for it.....BHO
