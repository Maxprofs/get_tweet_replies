@BarackObama Try this: Talk about LGBT as much as you talk about heterosexuality.
@TheMadFuturist @BarackObama If gays are committing suicide because they're gay, perhaps therapy would be appropriate. Not glorification.
@TheMadFuturist @BarackObama Why does it seem Leftists always resort to name calling. But I'm the bully?
@TheMadFuturist And what did I say that was ignorant? All I said was that suicidal people should receive therapy. Do you disagree?
@BarackObama @OFA u getting out of office as fast as possible means a lot to everyone
@BarackObama because of u mr president a whole section of society have lost all faith in politics #sellout
@BarackObama People stop worrying about what others do with their genitals & quit using it as a wedge issue to manipulate naive voters.
@TheMadFuturist @BarackObama You miss both the point of the question (as worded, anyway) and my point.

@BarackObama @OFA now wouldn't that be EQUALITY...Mutual Respect? I gotta respect them but if I don't agree with them it is not reciprocal!
@BarackObama @OFA and lastly is that as tolerant as they want others to be about their view, they need to be EQUALLY as tolerant of mine!...
@BarackObama @OFA however, marriage is not American, it existed before America! We don't have the right to change it! The Bible started it!
@BarackObama @OFA hmmm...LGBT equality? Simple, they have the rights to do what I can do as an American (vote, law representation, etc.)...
