The Marketplace is strong – and will continue to be strong – because it is offering a product people want and need.
Based on the best data, we project plan selections will grow by another million people this Open Enrollment.
The #ACA has helped us shape a tremendous future. Today, millions of Americans are better off. Let’s build on this historic progress.
facts do not matter to the GOP baffoons
My insurance has doubled. 2 Plans canceled. Higher premiums and deductibles coming in Jan. #fail
yup, I’ve had friends say the same and it’s not what @BarackObama originally promised. I will agree with #fail on that part
The whole industry is going down. Single payer and rationing. People will die. You will see. I'm old & have money.
there you go so why are you talking about it if you don't need it?
I benefited big time
You will be the kne who won't get the treatment you need, if you are younger than 40.
It's the millionaire doc and pharmaceutical companies and the insurance that made this mess. Greedy
Really then don't go to see them The crooks.
@womenshealth yet few are covered for  for #obesity care ... #OW2016
@BarackObama very great milestone
My rates have doubled. My second plan just canceled. Now higher premiums higher deduct. #fail
@Virgini83563067 Epic Fail Dems ram down r throats w/not even 1 vote across the aisle #ObamacareFail
f@#k you skick willy !! I hope you grt your just 'rewards' SOON !!!
Ask my brother about his premium being higher than his mortgage, his copay being in the thousands. #OutOfTouch
single payer would solve those things. It is why medicare works. Gov sets low prices & payer/provider has to accept
you clearly do not know what you are talking. Please tell me where you get your "facts"
Sugar coated bullshit
@BarackObama How much do you get paid to lie about #Obamacare and how do you sleep at night?


Forget the average working citizen having to pay premiums higher than their mortgage !!!   #OutOfTouch
,if it is true, then it is a good news
Seriously?! When you're #Unconstitutionally #Forced to have it, of course the numbers will rise...
heyy looking beautiful
My premiums have almost doubled. My newest plan was just canceled. More increases coming next year. I find out before election.
yah?? becasue the state now pays for 30% of it or more and no one can use it becasue the deductibles too high...
Americans were lied to and now many of my friends are going to have to pay hundreds a month for terrible coverage.
@BarackObama Why does this happen to good people...https://www.facebook.com/fnancejr/posts/10210446025125241 …
@HHS_Health That's great. Except that everyone knows that Obamacare is a total failure and so do you. And. So. Do. You. #liar
I would like to ask her how she sleeps at night. Meanwhile, she can go straight to hell. She sold her soul for a title.

what about the deductible??
.
@SecBurwell @BarackObama
@BarackObama but yet the premiums are through the roof makes a lot of sense
@WhiteHouse But our rates are going up! As a teacher, it's hard enough without having to pay for care I can't afford to use.
funny how that works when you threaten to penalize people for not having insurance. Weird
@BarackObama repeal this madness!
@BarackObama you won't put your own family on this insurance so why are you doing to the American ppl#
@BarackObama my insurance has increase to 9% which is ridiculous with no increase in pay. I've been employed for 20 year.
@BarackObama because of Obamacare none of my family has coverage. It is unaffordable.
.@SecBurwell Bernie Sanders on ACA: Despite the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act, 35 million Americans continue to lack health insura
@BarackObama true, but there is still more that needs to be done, we need to work even harder to bring down cost
WHAT WORLD DO U PEOPLE LIVE IN? PEOPLES PLANS ARE RISING TO UNAFORDABLE RATES, EXTENDED WAITING TIME 2 SEE DOCTORS
@BarackObama ascertain
http://Money4Task.com/?ref=293072 
@BarackObama and. The. Most. Expensive.
Americans being FORCED to purchase outrageously expensive plans that don't cover anything is NOT something to brag about. #smh
@BarackObama high as Hell
the Next step of trump is to take control of media
Next step of trump is to take control of media ( whatch)
Must be Too much THC in your brain cells with that FALSE statement. Figures don't lie but liars figure.
hi
Hi
@BarackObama Please let us keep our medical coverage!!
@BarackObama Coverage is not the same as Care. It's hardly affordable. Thanks for screwing more people than you helped.

coverage for what? Getting hit by a mack truck driven by a goldfish?
@BarackObama but Healthcare premiums are at an all time high
thank you Mr the president , with out your plan my wife  will be struggling to be insured
But no one can afford to feed their families.
@BarackObama
I tried to make Kenya great again but my brother forgot to help me. He lied.
@BarackObama Thanks to ACA I had good affordable health insurance after I lost my job. Without it I would have had no insurance.
@BarackObama and our premiums are higher than ever and national history. #repealObamacare #MAGA
insurance is a money sink to subsidize an industry of non-producers.
We still don't have quality employment that offers employee healthcare opportunities.  #Obamacare will collapse at this pace.
are you on drugs? My insurance almost doubled this yer and no doctor wants to take any insurance that's ACA.
obumer care sucks hide winner
except for Florida where Crooked Rick Scott refused expansion $$$. I have two adult daughters who can't afford insurance.
I appreciate the intent of the #ACA but the increased cost for the middle class & small business is onerous and unfair. REFORM!
The USA Must put people first and go for a Universal Med Care coverage. Protecting life & peace starts inland First...
@BarackObama UR deluded. Deductibles so high most DONT have coverage.
lol if it was so great you wouldn't have to penalize people. Greatest failure. 20 million lol illegals maybe.
...... total failure!
That is utter rubbish! The stats don't support your claim at all.
@WhiteHouse Gee thanks, we've been notified our employer can no longer afford to insure us. Next year we're on our own.
Say thanks to Obama.
@BarackObama My insurance is very expensive NOW.
If it was not for ACA my 44 year old daughter who was employed would not have had medical insurance coverage.
My xchange rate up by 45%. You're refusing to see the adverse selection!  And turn your back on the ACA poorer! Shameful
@WhiteHouse with deductibles so high you can't really use it unless u have a catastrophic illness.
don't forget to share your blessing...luv luv
I like you
alo
@BarackObama Job well done.
@BarackObama "Coverage" is a scam word for "worthless piece of paper."
simply not true.& forcing healthcare bills on us is so democratic.I got to keep my old doctor and my old plan..Give me a break
@BarackObama RU out of your mind. The premiums R up and the deductibles R up. Obamacare is a disaster for the American People!!
@BarackObama what have you been snorting, healthcare is more expensive now than ever before. Obama benefited from it.
@BarackObama on all on the backs of the middle class
So stop bashing President Obama
Great for the US. Fantastic for those now insured. But dont forget people with rare disorders and disabilities
@claudiajordan lol that’s a lie. Health Insurance is nowhere near the level of low it needs to be.
@BarackObama Tell that to trump!!!
@BarackObama thank you Pres. Obama for all U did I'm in healthcare & assisted several w/enrollment in my fam. It's saved lives
maybe so---but you should be made to pay the increase in my premiums that we were promised would not happen
just don't understand the ACA?
. It's amazing what you can get people to do when, if they don't do it, you threaten them.
@BarackObama Which comes at a price. Our National Debt is the highest in history. Highest. In. History
@WhiteHouse but your premiums are higher than my wall. That's pretty high! #DrainTheSwamp #Obamacare #ACA
@BarackObama is this a joke?
@WhiteHouse and costs have sky rocketed.  Sky.  Rocketed.  Government needs o butt out of healthcare.  Butt. Out.

Record numbers lost plans they liked, required by law to enroll in plans they didn't, only to lose those plans too! Brilliant! @SecBurwell
Stop trying to defend this shit! It's crap. They r nicole & diming us. Your killing us. Yes, the ppl u hv pying 4 this sht.
with the highest  premiums ever charged for high deductible low quality policies ever pushed on citizens.
The cost is unaffordable! People have signed up only because of the fines!
@BarackObama My son got a life-saving bone marrow transplant because of the ACA!!
grateful that was able to be covered by ACA.
@WhiteHouse  and my plan had to change and I do not get the same Dr's and it didn't save me $2500 a year as we were to believe.
lolololololol! You can't actually believe this can you?!?! Shit coverage at extortion level prices!
@BarackObama and everyone's premiums have skyrocketed! There's nothing "affordable" about this plan. It's unconstitutional
@WhiteHouse that is just sad
I am paying for Medi-Cal, and also a PPO under Obomacare, yet I cannot get life saving prescriptions filled, why?
Happy Socialism!! Welcome to Obama's Utopia! Where you have fewer choices, the gov knows what's best for you, and welfare 4 all!
@BarackObama Too bad it's soooo damn expensive for everyone who's not in congress or a president
I care about people being lied to, forced to buy something they don't want, going broke to pay premiums and deductibles.
I'm so glad the Insurance Industry is doing so well, I just wish the rest of the country could share in all those profits.
@WhiteHouse yea, but who can afford it? Failed system, it sucks.
@WhiteHouse is that why states are dropping the ACA marketplace at an alarming rate. 20M may hav insurance but 40M lost theirs
@WhiteHouse  I hope so!  My rates keep skyrocketing.  I was lied to by Obama and the Democrats.
But sure, you keep making SIGNED UP your happy place, screw everyone unable to actually use any of it. Moronic.
That's what happens when people are FORCED to sign up. Too bad people can't afford to actually see a doc.
Fess up Butwell. ACA is failing big time and will die under its own weight. And we do NOT want a single payer plan!
@BarackObama Our healthcare is still a joke, so I don't see a single accomplishment here
If u like ur plan u can keep it. U will save $2K per year. If u like ur doctor u can keep ur doctor. ALL OBAMA LIES!
yes Steve I agree my family members had to take it or Obama fines you what a leader he wants to own us as Americans.
controlers
@BarackObama Thank You.It was there when I needed it. Get it through work now but that is expensive too. Got to get cost down
save my husband  thank you Pres Obama
Don't believe this! My premium went up 500% and deductible $12,000. Can't afford house payment now!
@BarackObama people can't afford the coverage
@WhiteHouse ACA is going bankrupt & major providers are dropping out because they're losing BILLIONS! #ACAIsADisaster
@WhiteHouse Only the sick people who need it are joining, insurance companies are backing out, prices going up every year, YAY!
which plan do you have?
@WhiteHouse did the poverty rate increase at the same time? 20-50% premium increases isn't affordable.
There are as many uninsured today as there was before the ACA.
@WhiteHouse Which would be awesome, but my premium is going up by $100/month next year, so you might have to "minus 1" to that.
I'm already paying $50/month more this year than last year, and I can BARELY afford that payment.
Who's your health plan with?  My point, extactly

and insurance plans, quality, and wait times have also never been crappier...
UMMMM...... BULLSHIT.
@danaforbernie 2day millions of Americans lack healthcare and/or cannot afford drugs they need cuz BO threw Medicare4ALL under 
Not so sure  Many states refuse to support ACA and phar & med ind went crazyWorks great if all work together 
@WhiteHouse bs
@WhiteHouse Imagine that. When the gov't threatens to fine you for not buying their ins. People buy it. Getting like the MVA now
@BarackObama   @FoxNews   Your an idiot. Should be called Unaffordable Care Act.
ACA is good but not perfect yet .needs to be fixed and not repeal.
if only they'd fix huge flaws like the family glitch
NO RENZI NO TI PREGO!
https://www.facebook.com/isupportdonaldtrump/videos/1147897965229478/ …
@WhiteHouse but the coverage sucks and insurers are leaving the program.  What will be done to fix that?
