.@BarackObama Keep your hands off the internet. We don't need government mucking it up. You can't even run a website. .HealthCareDotGov=joke
@HarrietBaldwin @BarackObama You should probably go look up what Net Neutrality actually is all about and what standing for it means.
@chaoslord @BarackObama I already do, but thanks for the comment, Puddin. I suggest you do the same.
@HarrietBaldwin @BarackObama If you think "net neutrality" is some code word for "government control of internet" you probably don't.
@chaoslord @HarrietBaldwin @BarackObama Will the government be regulating Al Gore's creation or not?
@TorcerT @chaoslord @BarackObama Wait and watch. He wants to make into a public utility. #BS.
@HarrietBaldwin @chaoslord @BarackObama To err is human, to really screw things up it takes the Government
@TorcerT @HarrietBaldwin @BarackObama Paying more $ for less service is going to work well (lol). Internet in US is a joke. NN is needed.
"Open and Free" = Government gets control rather than Corporations. So Comcast still wins. @BarackObama
@Fallakin @BarackObama I don't think you quite understand what Net Neutrality is, do you?
Yes, sheep. I understand perfectly what Net Neutrality is. Both sides that call it that, this is a third. @JLBeight @mindreeder93 @chaoslord
Fuck your free, open internet. Can we get free, open education? @BarackObama
@DeportaDora @BarackObama what do you think the internet is?! Take some initiative and educate yourself – the world is at your fingertips.
@nickarmstronggr @BarackObama is Google giving out degrees now?
@DeportaDora @BarackObama Not google, but @edXOnline is. If you can't afford their certification price of $50, @MITOCW has it all for free.
@BarackObama @DEsterhazy As usual, the petition is set up so only Americans can sign it. *SIGH* Won't take my Postal Code.
