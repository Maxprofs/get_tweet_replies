.@BarackObama GOP wants war.  No matter what it costs the people or our troops. GOP wars  backfired.
@Jesse_Invictus @bimmerella always be there to support those who have served. Never give up my friend. And THANK YOU for all you've done.
@Jesse_Invictus When you finally got your benefits in 2014, were they retroactive? Did they pay for all your care since 2009?
@Jesse_Invictus That's great! I left the corporate world several yrs ago & started my own business too. What do you do?
@BarackObama why don't you fix America before we worry about who has nuclear weapons. Considering, that we were the only ones to use them.
@GeorgeSantee Of course other nations today are all more Sane than the U.S. was when We dropped the bomb.  Good observation George!  Not.
@MODUALITY bombs*
@GeorgeSantee "Dropped the Bomb" was a phrase that used to mean we used Nukes. Thanks for the s.
@MODUALITY we have bigger issues here that should be addressed but like you America loves to stick their nose where it doesn't belong.  
@MODUALITY there's another phrase for you.
@georgesantee Here's one for you: "Pull your head out of your ass." :^)
@MODUALITY why is your head in your ass man? You shouldn't do that. Maybe, you should call the police, but they'd probably shoot you.
@BarackObama Pay to have a liquid thorium reactor built in Iran or let AIPAC pay for it. Diplomacy and a reactor and no weapons grade waste.

@fourleafcons @BarackObama awsome...but Iran will not surrender to this idea
@MudassirAbbas01 They need to earn the worlds trust. If they want fight then that's all they will ever get. They can't make there own rules
@fourleafcons Iran has its own rules.They don't need any extrnal force to be implemented on them as u have observed in recent negotiations.
@BarackObama Stricter sanction , cut off all the blood life on them. Encourage people to start a revolution and support them this time.
@BarackObama @mrmcd172 : the GOP have NOT come up w/decent alternatives for over 6 years=good@ fillibuster,block,shutdowns,faux committees

@BarackObama I SAY GIVE OBAMAS DEAL A CHANCE,LET IT PLAY OUT. HAVE A LITTLE FAITH,GIVE THE IRANIANS A CHANCE.
@BarackObama Why is it that you screw something up and then ask for alternatives?
@BarackObama FORCING Iran to end their entire nuclear program. No options. You want to give them a nuke to kill us with. #conartist
@BarackObama Sam Rayburn said it best: "Any jackass can tear down a barn. It takes a carpenter to build one."
@BarackObama en otro tipo de energías, definitivamente no habría pretextos para manejar: uranio enriquecido. Saludo.
@BarackObama Fácil. La energía atómica debe dejar de ser fuente de energía eléctrica. Si el mundo estuviera sobradamente desarrollado...
@BarackObama @bimmerella Mr. President - they have none.  Nada, NOTHING.  They want war and they want to spend $$$. They have bubkus.

@BarackObama leave those ppl alone.  bring our troops home let it be
@BarackObama I'm sure Israel can think of one. I'm sure anyone with common sense can think of one too.
@BarackObama Don't fund Iran. How's that for an alternative
@BarackObama  How about a deal that forces Iran to release American Prisoners and stop Terrorizing Israel? #IranDeal
@BarackObama.. NO ALTERNATIVE FROM the republicans. THEIR TO BUSY TRYIN TO HURT OUR WOMEN AND THE POOR!!
@BarackObama And they've repeatedly responded with just such a plan. You choose to pay no attention. Nobody believes you when you say that.
@BarackObama You misunderstand them, they want war.
@BarackObama If that is a real bet, I'll take it. I just need to know all the REAL pain points, and how far your willing to go to achieve it
@BarackObama.

@BarackObama saya berharap Pak Presiden Amerika memberi ucapan selamat untuk pelaksanaan Muktamar Muhammadiyah di Indonesia

Impeachment.

@BarackObama @SusannaMatte cricket's
@BarackObama Mr Prez J-Kerry said repeatedly "he didn't know this & he or NO ONE on his team had even looked at side deals!" #Scary

@BarackObama Another strawman bites the dust! 1) Lv old deal in place 2) don't include conventl wpns 3) don't pay them $ 150 bil #surrender
@BarackObama That would be child's play compared to the sell-out, capitulation you have the nerve to BOAST about. U are pitiful, ya' know.
@BarackObama folks are good at complaining but bad with a suitable solution to certain problems such as this one.
@BarackObama Dude, I have to stop watching this lying coward. Makes me want to puke. HES CONVINCING NOBODY. PEOPLE HAVE WITNESSED MORE LIES.

@BarackObama Stand your ground Mr. President! We support you!
@BarackObama Dude, Obama couldn't wash Benjamin Netanyahus jock strap. He is way above a corrupt community organizer.
@BarackObama If Pakistan and Iran work together with nuclear assets then it can be better approach. but you should talk to them
@BarackObama yeah running a country is no child's play.easy to be by stander n  cement when u not the  one making decisions.
@BarackObama you are drunk? I do not believe it.
@BarackObama don't worry Pops would be proud of @POTUS @satchmofest
@BarackObama In the near future all contries will have nuclear weapons sleeping to protect themselves not as offensive but defensive.
@BarackObama Let the republicans be the 1st on the front line to fight, we progressive will not be fighting Iran for america. just saying...
@BarackObama 
US-Iran nuclear deal is the best available peaceful solution. Hopefully Congress will not listen to Israel who want conflict.

@BarackObama  
@BarackObama Republicans only alternative is war with Iran, so that can support weapons manufacturers and receive their "kickbacks/donations
@BarackObama correction, " so that they can receive their "kickbacks /donations " from their weapons manufacturer friends.
@BarackObama The president that follows you is going to have a hard enough time fixing what you've destroyed. And mending the division.
