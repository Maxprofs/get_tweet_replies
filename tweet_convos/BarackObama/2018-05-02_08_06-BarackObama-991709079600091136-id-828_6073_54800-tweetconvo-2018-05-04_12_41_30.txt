Thank you for all that you continue to do for our country and it’s kids. They are our future and you and Barack are our very best role models

Most of us are trying to ascend, while trump is infatuated with descending.
Right. And dragging us with him. The way we fight back is voting. Every 2 yrs is a must.
Always!

Sure thing donnie. THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO FIRE A CHAPLAIN?! AWW, THAT GOOD MAN DIDN'T BOW TO THE WANNA BE KING, DICTATOR? GOD IS WATCHING YOU BUD, BTW, in the USA, we have the freedom to believe in the God, Higher intelligence, or not. I believe,God& science both. You, $$!
Actually that was Paul Ryan who had the Chaplain fired, not Trump. And he fired him after the guy made a prayer that everybody in America should benefit from the tax plan.
GUESS that means you are either asleep, definitely love d.t., LISTEN TO FOX NEWS, WORSHIP MONEY, HANNITY, DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAW, CONSTITUTION ACTUALLY ARE, I SUGGEST YOU READ, LEARN, LIVE AND DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. NOT A MATTER OF LEFT OR RIGHT, JUSTICE FOR ALL. OK?
Uh, I don’t support Trump. I’m a Democrat actually and believe that everybody should be held accountable. I was just pointing out a mistake in your tweet earlier so other people can’t use it against you in the future.
I think one thing can be said with a certainty. Education is something we need more of in America.
Thank you for supporting an initiative that matters.
Thank you YOU for your support.
Sorry we can’t be in Philly but we’re celebrating your #CollegeSigningDay in MD, @MichelleObama!
Have fun! You look happy. Have a geat experience on the next chapter of your life.
Thanks! She's soooo happy! And I am too.
You must be so proud! Good job momma!

My daughter declined going to college. I feel your absolute joy & pride in your daughter. Cheers 
Things change. You never know momma. :) I wish you well
I love my president
Me to
President Obama, I saw that one explanation for the better employment numbers for African-Americans is that more African-Americans stayed in school while you and Michelle were in the White House.:) That’s something that can’t be rolled back.:)


This Black woman left the democrat slave plantation & is on the #TrumpTrain #Ukraine

A leader of our nation works hard to pressure evil regimes. Something your husband didn't do. He never even bothered with Otto Warmbier and now he is dead. So unlike the your husband, North Korea releases all U.S. detainees. What a difference a real leader makes!
Lord if I never seen her vile husband, or her again. It would be to soon. Where is the spits in disgust emoji!
Never forget 

The Genocidal destruction of Libya in 2011 UK and USA
