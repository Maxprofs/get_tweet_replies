@WhiteHouse @ErnestMoniz Context: this is about 0.2% of total US energy & will solve the climate crisis in 500 years; we have a decade.
@Peter_Night @WhiteHouse @ErnestMoniz Did you check the upward exponential curve of the graph? Production is almost doubling every year!
@WhiteHouse can you spell Solyndra?
@Collinsdw @WhiteHouse Can you spell 184 thousand megawatt hours of solar generated electricity?
@WhiteHouse Bravo! What is the channel for companies who might benefit from these new committed funds? How do we "apply" for consideration?

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama why can't solar stand on its own without all the handouts?
@WhiteHouse @DeelightRI   Thank You!  I'm waiting on Solar Panels! The Sun is always strong over my house!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Make sure that the solar panel price can be reduced to make more affordable for the minimum-wager

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama If it matters so much, why allow Shell to drill in the Arctic? #sHellNo
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama as long as people an save on taxes by installing them, they will. That and saving money on energy made me do it.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama Again your priorities are misplaced.  We should be focused on the lowest cost of energy, not how clean it appears.
@WhiteHouse why are you wasting taxpayers money on b.s. climate change you should be focusing on jobs here in The U.S.
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama please don't spend more money on my behalf, please!
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama sir, we need cheaper energy more than clean energy! We are 300 million, look at china and India they need to clean!
@WhiteHouse @Alasscan_ How about infra projects with the highest benefit/cost ratios instead?
@WhiteHouse        great news for future generations!
@WhiteHouse not good enough

@WhiteHouse @BarackObama clean energy should not clean flora and fauna due to over exploitation
@WhiteHouse Energy companies don't use solar because it's inefficient.  Why invest tax money in something the private sector avoids? Insane.
