@LizMAdetiba if a soldier failed to do duty, it's treason.  Same with #GOP Senate. Yes, this smells like treason.
Mr. President, why did you kill Justice Scalia?
@LizMAdetiba ......and the republican still aren't moving.....
Might mean a lot more if lawyer/congressmen weren't largely responsible for getting us in the mess we're in.
@HuffPostPol Wouldn't trust you to nominate a fucking paper boy

I confirm u r real person
Yes, because people trust lawyers to do the right thing.  This is laughable.
@LizMAdetiba   Who care if he can walk on water. Your appointment is be treated like you treated the the republican POTUS
please grant me a full pardon to be able to drive in the state of Iowa!?!?
What's good for the goose is for you diaper load.
@HuffPostPol do you remember how long it took for judge Bork to even get to a hearing? Don't smoke weed
We know he's more than qualified - it's the Republicans in Congress and the Senate who aren't.
He's in bed with you, which means he is poison for this country.
@LizMAdetiba #congress just do your job!
You've picked a great one Mr @POTUS
Well, the ABA is a Communist front organization.  Of course he'd get their highest marks.  What a surprise!
No body that sorry ass Obama puts up is worth a damn. They are all like him a pile of crap
@billmaher what do I have to do to get you 2 2gether?  Come on POTUS say u'll appear on RealTime! :-)
A genuine judge would wait for God to speak to him after he has heard all the evidence and read the reports about the accused
As if that means anything. Hell, you got a Nobel Prize for doing nothing!
very nice smile sir
congratulations to him 
@LizMAdetiba who gives a shit.

@LizMAdetiba  excellent choice !   Now if only the republicans who only serve themselves would do their job by confirming him
But will you get him into the Supreme Court before you leave Office.  We in Tanzania hope so!

Wonderful news! Installation of Judge Merrick Garland is now confirmed in Crystalline 5-Manifold Space by @US45 @HillaryClinton
And set a verification of certificate @US45HillaryClinton as Manifold(s) within Cold Fusion Conductivity.
I respect the integrity of http://illusion.Science  as a powerful tool in Cold Fusion Active Conductivity.
@LizMAdetiba get to work and stop Isis
Supreme Court just weakened 4th Amendment. We need a sensible jurist like Merrick to protect our rights.
LA TENES ADENTRO, GIL
@HuffPostPol You bet your butt Garland will be confirmed

#doyourjob
listen Pharoah America electing TRUMP PRESIDENT ending your legacy of lunacy TRUMP election CONSERVATIVE justice NOT you
it doesn't matter America wants new justice after election Pharoah Obama your legacy of lunacy ending November TRUMP PRESIDENT

So if Judge Alito had the same rating you confirm him?

@HuffPostPol
@LizMAdetiba well, maybe Donaldtrump will nominate him when he takes over
@LizMAdetiba the ABA is a leftist, corrupt front organization for the DNC.  Has been for years
so....
And you have the lowest rating as prez
@HuffPostPol Congress need to view, up Or down.
so what?
a okkk a love
@NinaGrubbs Doesn't matter to the do-nothing Senate. They only get enthusiastic when voting themselves a raise.
that is totally true!
We never wanted you as our President!
@LizMAdetiba how can you trust anything that come from your offc. Iran deal. Benghazi video, ACA, transparency
@LizMAdetiba Liberal organization backing a Liberal judge, what's your point?
@LizMAdetiba Most qualified and a good man. Tutors disadvantaged kids. Gave 5th grade grad address recently in DC school.
hi gmnng america frm thailand happy time
@HuffPostPol 

Stop Yazidi Genocide
Stand for Yazidi Women
it appears to many people do not understand what jurisprudence requires and what makes a person fit for the supreme court.
@SenateMajLdr  C'mon Mitch. This is a good pick. Your blocking strategy will be remembered historically. Angry voters hate it
@HuffPostPol idiotic republicans!
I'm rooting for you from Japan.
@HuffPostPol  He's qualified and they know it, they just won't admit it. My senator commended him all along until now. #shame
@HuffPostPol Republicans are too concerned with when they'll get their next contribution from the NRA.
good for him. i congratulate him for this recognition.
Do you think anyone really cares?????
@HuffPostPol tell me he's against citizens united and I'm on board
@HuffPostPol #stopYazidiGenocide #standforYazidiWomen
- well deserved!
@HuffPostPol why not positve thingking?  Maybe i am wrong. But if Bar be deleted will the best again
@HuffPostPol IMAGINE THAT?? DID YOU HEAR THAT REPUBLICAN DOUCHBAGS?
and economic whit estavility
@HuffPostPol This brings credibility to the whole parliament and American citizen.
@HuffPostPol I have to congratulate the award this specialist lei.Mérito assigned the work.
@HuffPostPol Obama really is creating a bad future for America's interests in the middle east,because he planned all these wars
@LizMAdetiba - because he is an establishment elitist who practices "Big Brother," jurisprudence. Sorry I voted for you twice
@HuffPostPol don't want him
@HuffPostPol our elected officials need to get their act together NOW.
only proving once again that a thousand lawyers at the bottom of the ocean is just a good start
lucky they don't confirm the nominee
@HuffPostPol sad that it still won't help him you did a good job with great opposition thank you
@HuffPostPol #MerrickGarland may get HIGH marks from  AM Bar Association but he get LOW marks from @NRA
@HuffPostPol so!!!!
@HuffPostPol well, mr Obama if there's a will, there's a way, indeed after all, wait and see!!
How much did Obama pay for that?
maybe if HRC stated she'd stick with nom, he could get passed?
Обама, когда в Англии наконец-то расшифруют "чёрные ящики" сбитого Боинга над Украиной? Может Россия поможет их вам расшифровать
no sé quién pone la foto de Barack Obama podríais ponerlo en español
who gives 2 shits? You picked him & you are inept/incompetent! The @SenateGOP is doing the right thing.
@HuffPostPol 
So what.
ISIS is KILLING PEOPLE IN OUR CITIES!
Why aren't you stopping that??
Get your priorities straight!
@HuffPostPol translation: this guy serves the system and the status quo
@HuffPostPol He could be touched by the hand of God and the Repubs wouldn't give him a hearing.
@HuffPostPol
@HuffPostPol I am absolutely sorry.to hear that, mr Barack Obama!
