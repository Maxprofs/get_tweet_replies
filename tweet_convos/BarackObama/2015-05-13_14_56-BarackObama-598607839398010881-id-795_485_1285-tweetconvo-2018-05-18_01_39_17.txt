@BarackObama You are leading on foreign policy. While you have failing behind on the economy, you are using smart strategy. Good luck. #Iran
@BarackObama this Pacific trade deal may be good for US companies to move their factories abroad but bad for U.S. workers.
@BarackObama You alienate even your own party with your "do as I say, not as I do" arrogance and have created this unbearable divisiveness.
@BarackObama   my name is Bang jong wan, please help me .....,
@BarackObama If you want it, then as history has proved over and over, it must be bad for the country.

@BarackObama TPP makes corporate entities=nation states how is that good? ISDS takes disputes out of courts & puts them in kangaroo courts.
@BarackObama This trade deal is a betrayal of everyone who voted for you. The Internet chapter & ISDS are indefensible.
@BarackObama Standing with Elizabeth on this one. US manufacturing, Labor Unions, Enviromentalists all disagree. This defines Treason to me.
@BarackObama TPP & TTIP r the products of corporate lobbyists & a threat to democracy. Stop the secrecy & remove investor protection
@BarackObama  if this bill is so good make it public now and let the public deside , not big business.

@BarackObama I spprt the most progressive trade agrmnt and the most progressive president of my lifetime - TPP NOW.
@BarackObama Understanding how important TPP is rather than listen to fundraiser-rhetoric, I stand with my president on this.
@BarackObama  I have always put my trust in you! Keep fighting, you have put the fair back into trade!
