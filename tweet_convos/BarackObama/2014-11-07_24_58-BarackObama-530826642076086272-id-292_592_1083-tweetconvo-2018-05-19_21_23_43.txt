@BarackObama hi
@BarackObama 2016, Republican trifecta of all three branches of government would again give all freedoms up for doing nothing, young lose!
@BarackObama The young have made a choice not to show up on boring election day and now they have two years left before the protections end!
@BarackObama The young are so detached from history that they do not even bother to go vote, but in 2016 freedom will be used against them!
@BarackObama once the Republicans regain the presidency they will have full power to reinstate the war draft , no dissenting votes to stop!
@BarackObama If the issue of drafting the young for war were on the ballet each election cycle you might see major turn out in young voters!
@BarackObama  America is a collection of many different people, young who don't vote often, old who vote all the time and crazy drivers too!
@BarackObama If you thought wasting 2 million troops serving in Iraq was a good thing then you are ready for a Republican President again!
@BarackObama The trifecta for the Republicans will be to Impeach Obama and finish off the democratic protections for seniors and the poor!
@BarackObama yeah the only problem is 2/3  the voters stayed home and allowed the republicans back into control, luckily not the presidency!
@BarackObama @OFA Voters across the country took a decisive vote against your economy killing policies. They were all on the ballot remember
