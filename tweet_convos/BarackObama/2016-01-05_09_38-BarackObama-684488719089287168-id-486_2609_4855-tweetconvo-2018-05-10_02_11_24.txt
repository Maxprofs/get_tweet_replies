@GabbyGiffords @POTUS America cannot lead the free world with daily mass shootings.
There aren't "daily mass shootings" and nothing he proposed would deter prior ones. @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS
@TorchOWyatt @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS There was an avg. of more than one mass shooting per day last year:
Using an arbitrary definition. The FBI counts 4 in 2015. @bujin_64 @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS
@TorchOWyatt @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS The list of shooting supports her assertion. Sorry if it doesn't meet your criteria.
Sorry if I don't think gangbangers doing a spray and pray into a crowd qualifies. @bujin_64 @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS
@TorchOWyatt @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS Sorry if you think over 1/day incidents of 4 or more injuries is acceptable in the US.
Maybe the cops should crack down on the gangs and stop plea bargaining away gun offenses. @bujin_64 @FreedomBull @GabbyGiffords @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS Show us where in the Constitution it says Congress can regulate firearms. In fact, it says the opposite.
@dkahanerules @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS 
How long ago was the Constitution written? Life has 'advanced',except for the killing aspect.
@Made0fHonor @dkahanerules @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS If u can't recognize timless beauty of the Consti, maybe you don't understand it.
@redandgearhead @dkahanerules @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS 
Ive studied it
@Made0fHonor @redandgearhead @dkahanerules @PressSec  So go back to only white, male, land owners voting as well? It was meant to evolve.
@WallyPeezy @Made0fHonor @dkahanerules @PressSec Race is not mentioned in the Constitution except for the word Indians twice, one removed.
@redandgearhead @Made0fHonor @dkahanerules @PressSec Right, but it said male citizens age 21+ and took law changes to apply to everyone.
@WallyPeezy @Made0fHonor @dkahanerules @PressSec National archive version does not use word male. Uses word person sometimes flowed with he.
@GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS No, and no. Obama's actions won't save lives.
@PoliticsAlabama @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS doing nothing will?
@daph_redd @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS Doing the wrong thing won't help, so this won't help. EFFECTIVE action, not just "do something!"
@PoliticsAlabama @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS making background check mandatory nation wide and for all gunshows and online sales is bad?
@daph_redd @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS Background checks were already required for all gunshow and internet sales by gun dealers.
@PoliticsAlabama @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS no it was not. Therein was the debate. 30-40% gun sales conducted in the USA had no checks.
@daph_redd @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS Amber, you're wrong. Gun dealers ran background checks on every sale, no matter where it happened
@PoliticsAlabama @daph_redd @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS some states did not require and business prentending private sales skirted laws
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS really I'm not a gun nut but the usa wouldn't be free without them don't listen to um Francis its a trick
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS If it saves one life,  its worth it. I'm in a heavily REGULATED profession, medicine. When I'm wading thru them, I +
@awelab1956 @GabbyGiffords @POTUS ,& how many deaths are due to big pharma & malpractice every yr? 100s of 1000s. regulated=more deaths.
@LeeHarveyAssad @GabbyGiffords @POTUS I'm an anesthetist. I know. Gun deaths? They matter. Hillary, 1st 100 days, take on big pharma. BS, no
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS millions murdered & body parts SOLD but u support that, Giffy.  Racist hypocrite!
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS sadly the inaction is collateral damage between two sides that lack the leadership to work together.
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS sorry that happened to you Gabby but mental illness was the cause not the gun were all glad we had guns in r beginning
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS take out Chicago, Detroit, and other gun free zones and the US ranks near the bottom. #YeahGun ControlReallyWorks
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS background checks do not stop criminals from buying guns. Why is that so hard to see?
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS i agree . My concern is there r so many places that r not n qqqaQ
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets @POTUS 3,287 ppl died in a car crash today! Just like cars aren't the problems guns aren't either. Ppl kill ppl
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Chicago, a hot bed of gun violence....enough is enough !
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS you people make me sick our founders are rolling over you all wouldn't have the right to do any of this without a gun
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS if the @POTUS actions are such common sense, he should have gone through Congress like he is suppose to do.
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS how exactly?
200k injured by firearms every year w/$14k in direct medical costs each year (nearly $3 billion annually) @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS
Doing more to make sure background checks done timely and checking more DBs doesn't deprive anyone of 2A @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS
@lawhawk @GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS And it still wont prevent gun violence by thugs or ISIS! It's not even a bandaid to the real issue
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS amen sister...  go ask the rothschildren to use stem cell on brain loss.  if you choose.
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS But you were in a Congress controlled by Democrats and did nothing. Whole meet square peg. #faux #dramaqueen
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS ... More people are killed by drunk drivers in a week ... D'you want ban alcohol too?
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS No it won't!  How many of these terrorist attacks are killed by guns purchased at a gun show? 0%!

@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS more people in the US drown in backyard swimming pools  let's ban swimming pools
@GabbyGiffords @Me_iam_Erica @POTUS You're a blind moron.
@DrunkChipYOLO @GabbyGiffords @Me_iam_Erica @POTUS 
@Support  This is cruel targeted harassment towards Gabby.
@Made0fHonor @GabbyGiffords @Me_iam_Erica @POTUS @Support You must be a spoiled coddled millennial aren't you?
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS sorry but all the gun law's you attempt to pass will not effect the criminal element
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Im a survivor of Gun violenece
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS see now if people had a Han job this wouldn't happen
@GabbyGiffords @D_Ericson @POTUS 
NRA + $$$ + Congress = mass murders
@GabbyGiffords @D_Ericson @POTUS 
Congressional indifference makes them a conspirator in the bloodletting
@GabbyGiffords What you FAILED to mention are the number of lives that are SAVED each day in America by private gun owners. See John Lott.
@GabbyGiffords @penny_bernath @POTUS Thank you for your leadership in fighting Gun extremism in U.S.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Your information is wrong, even gov stats don't agree
@GabbyGiffords @MTmarilyn2 @POTUS shame on Congress
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS  #it couldn't be more important
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS #Mark Kelly lets do something
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama guns don't kill people.people kill people.he is trying to find a loop whole around the right to bare arms.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS gabby, this tucson gal agrees with you.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS Congress wasn't the ones who murdered w/a gun. Punish those responsible. #commonsense
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS HOW? Not one of you dirtbag politicians can explain how your draconian measures will prevent evil.
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets @POTUS remember to #StopGunViolence but end the clear #genocide
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets @POTUS 900 or more Americans are killed in abortion everyday.
.@GabbyGiffords thank you for sharing :) Your courage inspires me everyday.  Keep standing up for sensible gun laws.
@GabbyGiffords @MitchBenn @POTUS More Americans die at the hands of guns daily than in Britain annually!
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS no it will not. He overstepped and now watch what happens. Criminals don't follow laws you are all idiots
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Check out  http://youtu.be/bbZ7wybGa_8?a    via @YouTube for more info
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS  Show those countries who have gun control Have more murders
@GabbyGiffords worried about gun violence but still letting them into the country because we don't want to offend anyone.
@GabbyGiffords 4,931 babies killed everyday, but you sleep at night and that doesn't bother you and they are just as innocent as the 33
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States … Agreed.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS ..its was all good when You were shooting at pictures of young men ..and now?
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS  guglielmoemanuele @gmail. com
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama Then why does he not just go after the criminals.What happens when people are not able to defend themselves.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS how? Address broken homes, morals, family values. NOT INEFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE ORDERS!!!!  You are wrong.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS No it won't.
@GabbyGiffords @TheDemocrats @POTUS Petextrian deaths up alarmingly over past 5 years.  Everyone watch out.  PHONES ARE KILLING US
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS so let's just keep stats to see if this helped. Americans doubt it
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS I'm sorry about what happened to you gabby, but these measures would have done nothing to stop that
.@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS 34 years of political imprisonment and Obama do nothing. We need responsible action #FreeOscarLopez
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS 8,000 everyday act with potentially deadly force to prevent injury or death to them or a family member.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS How many abortions every day?  How many last year?  56 million total since RvW. Sickos!
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS The one who obeys God serves all.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Actually people murder.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS And this won't help do anything but make more victims, criminals don't care about new EO either
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS idiot. Evil is in a man's heart not his tools.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS care to share the statistic on how many of those are with guns that were obtained illegally?
@GabbyGiffords if they muslims what would happen ,.?
@GabbyGiffords @ChrisPaulComedy @POTUS how many of these murders would have been stopped by the "gun show loophole"?
@GabbyGiffords @ChrisPaulComedy @POTUS how many lives will be lost because people can't defend themselves?
@GabbyGiffords @ChrisPaulComedy @POTUS how many of these murders are in places where guns are already illegal?
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Democrats held the Congress a few years ago, lost it due to inactivity and stupidity.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS He did more damage by more unlawful presidential fiat than any lives that MIGHT be saved
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS  #motorfunctions
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS no, they won't. the NCIS system is broken. criminals do not fear the law. your little bans are feel good
@GabbyGiffords  NOT according to the FBI,22000 killed by guns are suicides, NOT murders. More are killed by knives, than assault weapons.
@GabbyGiffords your voice on this issue is extremely important. With love and respect! Stay strong Gabby!
@GabbyGiffords @danicaleys @POTUS Lots to do, structural change
@GabbyGiffords @danicaleys @POTUS But not enough.
@GabbyGiffords @TheDemocrats @POTUS count the number of Americans who are murdered in #PlannedParenthood abortion mills. bother you at all?
@GabbyGiffords Did you and your husband ever sell the guns Y'ALL bought? What about Mr. Giffords ILLEGAL purchase? @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS all i'm sayin is when the Black Panthers exploited the THEN gun laws, they got changed REAL QUICK
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Where in the hell do you idiots get your stats from? Keep making up lies.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS how many are killed by cars?  How many by medical malpractice?
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets Hope @POTUS doesn't pull any FBI agents off of the investigation of @HillaryClinton and her email server!
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets @POTUS What lives in #SanBernardino #SandyHook were saved by anything @POTUS did today?
@GabbyGiffords No, it won't.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS let's hope Congress can be waik-up quick as possible to avoid more HUMAN LIVES, so why not?
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets @POTUS HOW? MS GIFFORDS? AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU GETTING FOR SAYING THAT?
@GabbyGiffords @HelpThe99ers @POTUS is that accurate? I hope you didnt heap in the gang warfare deaths and all.
@criticalthort Why, exactly, should they not count? Are some lives worth less than others, in your reckoning?
@HelpThe99ers would you protect the life of someone who massacred millions? probably not
@criticalthort who in this conversation about murdered Americans has "massacred millions" exactly?
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS and another 6000-7000 die daily due to other reasons.
@GabbyGiffords @carolemorrissey @POTUS & Australia's got an imbecile in the senate , that wants to allow everyone to carry handguns ! CRAZY
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS as long as you all have armed guards, your words mean shit! #StopGunViolence
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS no matter what argument gun control politicians make, it means nothing as long as they are protected.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS what about knives?
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS Exec orders also apply to gun control.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Do you think those murders took place by legal gun owners? http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/11/report-92-percent-of-mass-shootings-since-2009-occured-in-gun-free-zones/ …
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS love you Gabby. Thanks for your hard work and #Unbreakable spirit
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS You think bad guys register their guns?
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS he did nothing to stop criminals Gabby. Stop misleading the public
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS You're 15 minutes of fame are over, Gabby.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS How many people are killed with knives per day, Gabby?
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS And yet over 3,000 babies are murdered in the US every year and #PlannedParenthood sells the parts
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS thank you
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS 3,000 Americans are murdered everyday by abortion. Where are your tears for them? 
@SeanFinley @TexasRebel1836 @GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Don't you have to be BORN in the USA to be a citizen? The unborn are not.
@TexasRebel1836 @SeanFinley @GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUSNope you must be born in the usa to be american the unborn are not =syllogism
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS keep it baby 
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS brain dead
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS @BarackObama life is nt nobel prize. Nt Oscars. Nt yet grammy. .life is only life..it is breath.dnt stop it
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS that's a lie
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS nothing the President did takes the illegal guns away from the criminals. It only affects the law abiding
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS His actions were an abuse of power and a violation of our Constitution.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS  Stop infringing on our 2nd amendment.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS most of the killings by guns are suicides&accidental deaths. Not mass shootings, not law abiding citizens
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS where is the tears for the men that got killed looking for Bowe Bergdahl when he deserted our country?
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS It will also increase gun sales.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS where's the tears for our guys in Benghazi? You went to sleep and flew off to Vegas&you deserted them!
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS where is the tears for Kate Steinle that was murdered by the illegal immigrant in the sanctuary city?
@GabbyGiffords. when you had full brain capacity you were against gun control. Now that you have only half a brain, your for it.
@GabbyGiffords @PressSec @POTUS And how many of these are suicide,  gang related or just plain thuggery? 32? Don't be stupid.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS no it will not
@GabbyGiffords @CarlaCapone2969 @POTUS 
@HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs & @NRA are the real terrorists
@GabbyGiffords Every 52 minutes a person is murdered by a drunk driver.  Let's put that "33" into perspective with some common sense.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS. I applauded Sen Gifford. Thanks for remaining brave and strong.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS 在中国，鸟枪都是非法的，从小到大都没有摸过，我该高兴，还是难过呢
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS They're murdered by PEOPLE not guns you troll. People kill people. Guns aren't the problem. People are!!!!
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS yeah and how many of those guns were purchased by felons off the street or guns they were stolen
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS No, they won't. Stop lying and pretending these "feel good" measures do anything.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS do you know how many unborn babies were killed by PP. Obama supports and doesn't care about black babies!
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS hear the hypocrite with guns in her house, shooting like no one watches, more proof of cowardly action
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS he wants to have some kind of legacy to leave other than he's the first black president
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS what about Kate? Obama didn't care about the sanctuary cities and illegals killing Americans! Diversion
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS You can't be that stupid ?
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS And he/she is the breaking the law when the do it, like felons care about breaking the law.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS sorry about what happened to you but we do have the 2nd Amendment and we will not back down! Illegal!!
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS How were they murdered? Look at the policemen  killed due to Obama and Blacks and inciting the murders!󾓦
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS guns don't kill people. People kill people with guns.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS what happened to you was by a mentally ill person&evil. Not by American with guns. 2nd Amend, read it!
@GabbyGiffords & @WhiteHouse know we can't throw up our hands and do nothing. For those lives stopped short, and their families, do it Now.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS the murders are not done by law abiding citizens with permit to carry guns
Hypocritical Twit.  #ComeAndTakeIt @GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS today's illegal actions will only lead to a new secession. The freedom of the people is the highest law in the land.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS what about the 22 veterans that take their own lives everyday?
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS @BarackObama what about the ones u buy on the street
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS <--His actions are an abuse of power and violate our US Constitution #Impeach
@PattieCurran @Pinkamom  @BarackObama @POTUS they hope to prevent criminals from getting guns by criminalizing honest working Americans.
@JamesA46 @PattieCurran @BarackObama @POTUS bt criminals don't live by laws,hence y they're criminals,which leaves only the armed criminals!
@GabbyGiffords @DWStweets @POTUS thanks for your work on this,I know it's personal, and your story is amazing. Gabby you are our light.
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS  guns used in less than 2% of all preventable deaths in U.S.   We have bigger issues.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS San Bernadino wouldn't have happened?   Do Chicago and California have strict gun laws? #Stupid
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS 30% of all deaths in America from heart disease.   Congress does nothing.
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS  an estimated 2000+ lives were saved today using guns in self defense.
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS  1190 people died from tobacco today. So did 95 people from alcohol.  Nobody seems to care
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS guns don't kill as many as drunk drivers
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS certainly good step, wish Congress would do something!
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS quit lying, retard. Put the crack pipe down and just quit. You are just lame.
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS Actually Congress passed the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1968 and 1994. But US had relevant leaders back then.
@GabbyGiffords @WhiteHouse @POTUS
@GabbyGiffords @BarackObama @POTUS the 2nd amendment doesn't mean to let crazy and mentally sick people to buy / own guns. Be safe America!
@GabbyGiffords @POTUS @PressSec hasn't the president just started releasing prisnors?
