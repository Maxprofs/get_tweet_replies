@BarackObama But they can deny coverage of medications for those conditions.

@BarackObama This is simply great. I wish we had this in Egypt.
@TheRoosha @BarackObama 
You do not want this in Egypt. Health Care costs are increasing, business are firing workers and economy is falling
@Bikeric01 @BarackObama This is happening here in all cases. Yet we don't have coverage :(
@TheRoosha @BarackObama 
If Egypt adopts ACA, the government will simply force those without coverage to buy coverage or be fined. Great??
@Bikeric01 @BarackObama Not great of course, but still poor are forced to die here. In comparison to being fined? hmmmmmm
@TheRoosha @BarackObama 
America has had a system for years called Medicaid for the poor who can't afford coverage.
ACA is totally different
@Bikeric01 @BarackObama Ah OK I see. Then all the best. Regards from Cairo.
@TheRoosha 
May you have a blessed day. Regards.

@BarackObama I will be next November 23 to 28 Tampa in Florida visiting my aunt Rosaura.
@BarackObama but your coverage can refuse to pay for services based on pre-existing conditions.
@BarackObama And that was also possible prior to ACA. #NiceTry
@BarackObama FACT: 2015 insurance rates projected to increase by double digit % points across the board. but "free" healthcare, right!
@BarackObama bless you sir,  South Africa loves you.
@BarackObama
@BarackObama No, but they can be charged enough that they can't afford it.  What happened to AFFORDABLE health care?
@BarackObama ACA, coverage is one part of quality care for all Americans, high insurance deductible result on lots of out of pocket expenses
@BarackObama To get up so early really very professional ah
@BarackObama 
TRUE: But we CAN be extorted higher premiums based on lifestyle choice. 
–or am I just being pedantic?
@BarackObama also fact: you lied about keeping your coverage.
@BarackObama @cenkuygur Everyone enrolled means no more free loaders as well. I like it
@BarackObama psychiatry as part of healthcare might get creepy and we all pay for that nightmare. here the future working this out.
@BarackObama Health Ins. co. are getting around that & Drs. are helping them.
@BarackObama doctors are prescribing unnecessary meds, or scared (DEA) to prescribe proper meds, & they still call it Obamacare.
@BarackObama Why do my premiums continue to increase with less coverage and higher deductibles?
@BarackObama FACT: you may have coverage, but the doctor, procedure, and/or hospital you need likely isn't covered by it.
@BarackObama ~^&~
@BarackObama #Obamacare the #Lie that just keeps on getting bigger.
@BarackObama hello
@BarackObama Can insurers charge an arm and a leg though for the policy?  How affordable will policies actually be?
@BarackObama I am so happy that the right hasn't blamed you for the trooper murder in PA.

@BarackObama FACT: Due to the #ACA, husband-wife corporations cannot keep their existing group health care coverage. ACA defines them out.
@BarackObama hello Obama
@BarackObama instead, our constitution is ignored and citizens are required to pay for insurance, raising prices around the board
