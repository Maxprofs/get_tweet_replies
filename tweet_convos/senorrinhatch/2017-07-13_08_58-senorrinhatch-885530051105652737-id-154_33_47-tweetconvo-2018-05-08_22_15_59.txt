The stripping of healthcare for millions is delayed until Sen. McCain can have his Dr's treat him? IRONY. NO MORE #GOPdoublestandards https://twitter.com/bpolitics/status/886429945345585153 …
What does Mitch need with the money he's saved? Is he planning on pork barrel incentives to get to 'Yes?'
Help himself and rich friends vote all out that vote yes
We want a FULL REPEAL!  It some half ass version of ACA! FULL REPEAL! Nothing less!!!
This health plan is not better than the ACA
This isn't better care, it's worse and it EXEMPS all members of CONGRESS and the SENATE from having to sign up for #trumpcare!
Proven best care is ObamaCare!  Hands down!
How dare you lie to #Americans! If @GOP repeals/replaces #ACA you no longer have to use it, going back to your FEHBP plan while screwing us!
Get rid of all that yes

Bad Care. This plan is dangerous & harmful. 2018 you will be voted out.
Unless choosing a straight policy as offered by insurers we should be able choose an ala carte policy that covers what we need as an individ
Veterans deserve MUCH better than we get at VA Claims and Appeals.
Yes we do

Vote them out that vote yes

Vote all out that vote yes
Let people buy insurance across star lines.
We, the People were promised #FullRepeal! #KeepYourPromise Get the gov't. out of healthcare!#CongressDoYourJob #UnitedForFreedom
We will just be going backwards with this proposed health care bill. Vote NO.
Imagine a box of cereal costing $10.00? Paper plates $8.00? Taxes pay 4single payer! Nothing is free! GOP has best idea. Give it a try.
GOP has a bad idea and your example does not make sense. GOP is taking away insurance.
Single payer cost involvement of all businesses whose costs bleed down to their products! Ask Canada, UK, & Australia what it cost 2live
Why not have Health Insur similar to Car Insurance? With Fed Gov giving strict guidelines 2protect US from being gorged by Insur Companies.

YOU should have to sign up for #trumpcare if you're going to try and force the rest of the ppl in this country to!
You guys should change your name to lemmings. How much longer you going to follow Trump down this road??
Going Backwards in healthcare is shameful.  Your solutions are NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  We Deserve Better.
Sick of the lying politics! What happened to real Patriots? #REPEALOBAMACARE only! #UnitedforFreedom!
Vote all out that vote yes
Only vote on and heath care bill that you will be buying for your self.  Then if it goes though buy it as good faith in your vote.
This is not a repeal of the ACA. Repeal ACA completely. Insurers must be able to sell policies across US. Straight policies or ala carte.
Nothing but a re-worded version of the same trickle-down, tax cuts for the rich BS you have been trying to sell.
They give the way of truth a bad name. They’re only out for themselves. They’ll say anything,, that sounds good.
Must have inter-State purchasing to bring price competition. Don't let K Street relative Lobbyist control you!
Do your job! Repeal as promised! #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Liberals are saying this new draft exempts members of congress. Please explain.
It's time you all understood that Americans no longer need you to do our thinking for us. #FullRepeal as promised! Stand #UnitedForFreedom!
We will get worse care w/ stripped down coverages. Med costs will rise to compensate providers for unpaid care from more uninsured people.
Vote NO. I will contribute on this until you realize you "better care" bill is terrible. VOTE NO @SenateDems
Know this each and every CONGRESSMEN MUST have the same healthcare as their bosses - We The People. We are watching.
I will be interested to see what the revised CBO estimates are. Let's not persecute the poor and the elderly
Americans deserve #MedicareForAll and not lesser, more expensive care to pay for tax breaks for the rich. #NoTrumpCare
Is your healthcare plan like buying a used car? U keep throwing crap out there to see what Americans may be agreeable to finally? Keep going
DJT & GOP has sabotaged the ACA with lies and negative propaganda & defunding  FIX ACA
nah tragic sad you can't work w the Dems and create &fix Ocare. Your damaging the GOP!! Sad sad sad.Autism child will lose
The American people elected you to repeal Obamacare you're all cowards
Americans deserve a healthcare bill not a tax cut for the rich.
Sickos   2018 will be bad for gop
No.  Let #Obamacare fail so @TheDemocrats live with it and its consequences... own it
I am still waiting for the better part.  So far, not seeing it.
America deserves GREAT healthcare but its not likely to come from @SenateGOP!
This is simple:  it's junk. No surprises here.
Better Care, yes! AHCA, no!
Your bill has a 5-to-1 ratio for "older' enrollees, Obamacare has a 3-to-1 ratio. You expect ages 56-64 to pay 5 times more?.@marcorubio
#BetterCare huh?
Liar
#publicOption or #singlePayer
This does not work!! How many times do we have to tell you? #FullRepealAsPromised
#CongressDoYourJob
#FullRepeal
#UnitedForFreedom
#FullRepeal waspromised to the people keep your promises we won't forget no replacement #UnitedForFreedomTexas
I read it. It fucking sucks.
it wont be from you failures.
Americans deserve better representation by the GOP rather than having it revolve around how much $$$$$$ they can make off of us.
#FullRepeal
Another bad plan that hurts Americas and gives rich tax breaks!  Plus insurance that provided campaign bribes makes big money!

Pediatricians have a message for the Senate: “It is impossible to cut Medicaid without hurting children.” #KeepKidsCovered 
We deserve a plan that's working right now. MEDICARE FOR ALL
#Repeal, not prop up!
Tax Cut for Rich by Cutting Medicaid and dumbing down "bare bones" insurance that no one can use #NotBetterCare #TrumpCare
RINOS please NO more huge government healthcare an other programs, please please do the right thing, kill Obamacare
Prove it!
We cannot bail out the insurance company.  We need that money for the wall or our elderly
What this would do  is allow insurance companies to sell policies where a person could find out they have cancer but not pay for treatment.
Really, this is the best you could come up with? You are clueless with issues your constituents face and the negative outcome of this bill.
Before Reagan became President, Republican Drug Company CEO's made $100,000's, now they make $100,000,000's. GOP GREEDOM is the problem.
Trumpcare mean not many can afford healthcare and the ones with will have massive benefits cut.
Plz sit down with Dems and work on a policy for all us.Explore single payer/universal. Are we really only country that can't figure this out
#AHCA or #BetterCare #PassTheBill
We also deserve jobs that pay enough to live and raise children in good health and a government that protects our life liberty & prosperity
How can it be PROPER REPRESENTATION of your constituents  to be voting the richest 1% a little tax cut AND threatening HEALTH of 22m???
ONLY path to lower premiums is to lower Ins Co and Big Pharma's profit margins.  We can't afford to keep paying them billions @POTOS #MAGA
Still a piece of crap! Universal Healthcare is what we the people want and need. Quit trying to cram this crap down our throats!
Let everyone read and comment before vote. This should be bipartisan, too many affected.
#BetterCare is a catchy title for GOP wealthcare disaster. Wish it were true because America really  needs it. .

We want government out of our healthcare
If you don't have the stomach to get the job done will find someone who does
I like the idea of lowering premiums but not at the cost of losing coverage. Deductibles must be lowered as well.
Keeping Obamacare taxes is not what we voted for. #RepealObamacare
This sure they hell is not going to help people....
Please explain in detail with unbiased facts how the A.C.A. increased health cost when all reports I've read health cost have decreased.
Economics 101: If costs go up, costs are rising.
If government still involved it's not better! REPEAL NO REPLACE!!!!!!!!
Stop the nonsense
#savemedicaid #NoCutsNoCaps  #donoharm #killthebill2
Time for universal, single payer health care. Health care is a right for all people.
Not in the US constitution it isn't.  You want socialized medicine, move to a socialist country
Liars, all of you!
Discussion draft? Does that mean you are going to have actual discussions in committees and on the floor with Democrats? Like with ACA?
If you really wanted to get costs down you would go after big pharma instead of giving them a tax cut when they already pay little to no tax
Americans deserve lots of things you've failed to help with over the years but #Trumpcare isn't one of them
Then get off your asses and pass one! #MAGA #Support45
Remember the lie, "Read My Lips, No New Taxes!" got us Clinton!
"Repeal Obama-Care First Day!" will get you replaced if it too is a lie!
You Promised:

Repeal Obama-Care!
Balanced the Budget!
Build the Border Wall!
Pass Tax Reform!

Get It Done!
Yes, we do. And this is NOT it. This is WorseCare. Ask the AMA.
.@gop = #WorseCare 

(Good one).
The key word here is Americans.  Not illegals.  Insurance would not be so expensive if we were not providing coverage to every illegal
Better Care is Universal Healthcare Expanding ACA ALL GOP does is TAKE from the 99% who need healthcare the most VOTE THEM OUT READ TRUTH!!
America needs better representation from our elected official not these GOP russian sellouts!!#TrumpRussia
Get Obamacare repealed or be the minority party in 2018. I promise that will happen. We will not be lied to anymore from the @GOP .
Hey what about HR 676 that has been reviewed for far longer and seems like a better option https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676 …
@gop $200k+ salaries no concept reality. I challenge any of you to go live at poverty level for a month...home clothing food all pov level.

HSAs are only good for people who can save. A lot of people live check to check cuz we keep bailing out unregulated businesses who fail.
17% approval
You are right we deserve better care but your healthcare bill will only make our current healthcare worse. #MedicareForAll is #BetterCare

Better CARE -- what a joke. You give us less and ask us to pay more so that the 1% can live like kings!!! Nice going GOP... going backwards
#trumpcarekills


We deserve a better president and congress @GOP @FloridaGOP
Americans deserve the BEST HEALTH CARE & should be a one payer system that works for all & not just 4 the Rich who can afford all no worries
So then call your rep concerning HR 676 to move it out of subcommittees https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676 …
Reads like love letter to the insurance lobby and a hearty FU to 99% of the citizenry.

All for a wealth transfer to .4%.

Aholes.
NOPE!
Great Bill unless you are poor and/or elderly. Just plain cruel.
I love how y'all act like it's a book. When is the CBO score coming out? First hearing?

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …

POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
You guys are better at killing Americans than terrorists
Trump promised BETTER MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL AMERICANS!
