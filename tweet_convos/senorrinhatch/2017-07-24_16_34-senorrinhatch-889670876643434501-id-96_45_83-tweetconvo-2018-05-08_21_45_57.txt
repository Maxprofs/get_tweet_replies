Saw your BS comments re Jeff S.  u guys are failing us!  Sick of your typical do nothing style!  JS performs or he's out
We voted to #RepealObamacare ONLY! No Replace! The private sector will replace more efficiently and cost effectively than government!
#utpol
Sure we saw how good the private sector worked pre ACA. Rates increasing, deductibles increasing. Preexisting clauses and lifetime caps.
As opposed to the treatment-prohibitive tripled premiums and deductibles post-Obamacare, correct?
We're putting our own families first now.
ACA slowed the rate at which premiums rose.
85% of Americans qualified for tax credits that kept up with premium growth, meaning most people didn't see an increase in costs.
ACA also increased the amount of healthcare insurance was mandated to cover.
Which is why we're stuck with treatment-prohibitive premiums and deductibles. My previous policy worked for me, not everyone else.
No, ACA insurance is mandated to cover more than insurance did before.
Which bill is being voted on? What do you want in it? The whole process has been behind closed doors, & we can't trust you. #VoteNoBCRA
Vote on what. To talk about something that half the country disagrees with. Fix the markets and stop insurance companies from stealing
The floor debate will be a sham. McConnell will substitute a different bill at the last moment. Return to regular order @senorrinhatch.
Oh so now you care about debate? Why didn't you advocate for a SINGLE public hearing? What exactly are you even voting on? MTP is about vote
Do not support this Senator Hatch. Please.
Does anyone in your office even read the replies to your tweets? #downthehatch
Senators need to keep promise of #fullrepeal.
Socialist healthcare easily leads to tyranny. Get Gov hands OUT of our HC.
Repeal would increase # of uninsured Americans, difficulties from pre-existing conditions, the federal deficit, and out of pocket costs.
I have talked to nurses who had to train two weeks just to learn/get accustomed to the ridiculous amt of Obamacare rules & regulations.
Regulations or the unemployment line. #nursesfortrump = unemployment
I would like to repeal and replace Trump's behavior at the Boy Scout Jamboree. He used this moment to bully. "Loyalty" to whom? Him? idiot
Do your jobs!
support repeal?
Your mouthes say yes
Your actions say not..pwer of the purse coulda stopped it..instead congress funded it COMPLETELY.LIARS
People who care about Obama anything are partisan hacks. Americans want healthcare, call it whatever makes your feel better. #FixWhatWeHave
Where are the details on the bill? What are you even voting for?
#retireHatch your use by date has long since passed.  Ppl need health care as good as yours.
#ImproveACA Don't listen to bully potus. Your constituents don't want repeal/replace. Elections are sooner than you think 
You should be more diligent getting trump out of office
I am a utahn and support ACA
For WHAT?!? No one knows what the literal f*ck is open for replacement. Quite the blind leap there Orrin.
You only want a win.... it will fail because it's a bad bill and vote
Perfection isn't expected. That's why the ACA needs fixing, not replacing. I have friends here in UT who'd be dead w/out it. DO NOT PROCEED.
I don't support anything unless a valid replacement has been worked on by both sides.  #utpol  Don't just do the easier part...
How can you support that man? I thought you were one of us? You would not allow a scout leader to talk like he does at camp! Family matters!
ACA is one more popular than all GOP/Trumpcare bills. Improve ACA. Don't hurt millions of Americans after views have shifted
Nooooo!!! This is evil. Please just work to fix ACA. Please don't vote when you don't even know what you're voting for!!!!
How's bout with replacing with something other than out of the Mein Kampf playbook then?
Don't vote for trumpcare without debating and allowing all reps & the American people time to review the bill. Hold off on the vote.
Taking medicaid away from the disabled is horrific. Taking medicaid away from the elderly is horrific. Taking the American Dream is horrific
Vote No Mr.President 46
60 times u have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act-  - get over it!  All because your hatred & racist views toward President Obama
Hey old man... Face it SINGLE PAYER is the best option!
You are a sinking ship
Senators who care about the health of their constituents will #VoteNoMTP.
Senators who care about their constituents wouldn't mandate they be excluded from #ORRA. We all deserve #Congresscare.
As your constituent, I would rather you extend across the aisle and work on improving the already helpful American Care Act.
Do you even KNOW what your constituents want? A hint? The majority do not want this. You're out of touch, Senator.
We have been asking 4 months 4 bipartisan, transparent discussions. Having a short debate before you vote, possibly tomorrow, isn't enough.
@SenMikeLee U said u wouldn't vote if the vote was rushed or there wasn't open discussion. Please keep your word. Voting tomorrow isn't ok.

Go Ahead Tough Guy #DOIT @realDonaldTrump Voters To Be Biggest Losers In Republicans Obamacare Replacement plan http://fw.to/4gEZN6b  @WSJ
Trumpcare is a taxcut for the rich, not a health care plan, but none of us really know, other than 24M will lose insurance! Soulless GOP.
Nobody wants what you are selling.
No! Not till the bill us looked at! What's the rush?
Do good work not fast!
This has to be done. Period!
How about allowing more than a one day debate.
No more wasting time. DEBATE Repeal and REPLACE. Senators, you owe it to the Americans who made you the MAJORITY.    #utpol

LIES AND NAZI PROPAGANDA.
Congress should've had this on the floor on the first day of the new session. Repeal. Remove restrictions, allow competition. Don't replace.
Step 1:  Repeal
Step 2: Replace with a) Fully funded Medicare for 65+ and Medicaid for those who truly need it; and b) private mkt for rest.
How about we show support for the American people by allowing debate and input from Dems and healthcare professionals?
You probably don't understand it cause you are reading prepared statements from your aides but this will take healthcare from millions
#Repeal replacement is just more Obamacare socialism
Do you know what you plan to replace it with yet? I told my dad for years I wanted to hear the Republican plan.  Can I see it first? Please?
New bill is called #ORRA.
Premiums double in less than 10 years and three-quarters of Americans won't have access to any insurance plans on the open market?  1/2
This definitely means more Americans bankrupt by medical bills. We should fix ACA, but this is a big step backward for millions.  2/2
I like you @senorrinhatch but the toothless GOP hiding under their desks afraid to stand up for @POTUS are looking like a bunch of cowards.
How about standing up for AMERICANS. Medicaid allows MY CHILD to get JOB TRAINING through school. Stealing Medicaid from the disabled??!!!
Cowardly is defined as doing the wrong thing because everyone in your crowd is doing it. Voting for #Trumpcare is COWARDLY and WRONG.
I support the effort to replace Sen. Orrin Hatch. I will show it by voting against Sen. Hatch at his next reelection.
He has held office for over 40 years??? Ridiculous!! Long past time 4 term limits 2 be addressed.

Your tax payer healthcare will not be taken or capped I get to pay for your healthcare while I will be able to afford any for my self
You haven't  read the bill, you don't know what's in the bill, but you're voting for the bill.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU
NO!!!! WE DONT!!!
Liars, despicable excuses for men, we will never forget what you are doing #Traitors #PutinTrump #YourDayWillCome
Ha ha ha you aren't going to do shit. Cute little tweets talking smack.
#TrumpCrimeFamily #PutinTrump #FU
Dear @senorrinhatch- your voicemail is full! #OBGYNs know & have better health  access with #essentialbenefits of ACA. #RejectTheRepeal

Priceless
What bill? As far as I've heard, no one's even seen the thing yet.
Y'all are an irresponsible pack of hypocrites.

This health care bill isn't simply unconscionable and unjust. It's unconstitutional.

We won't stand for it.

New York's Attorney General just threatened to sue over health care.

I support the effort to remove our unhinged @POTUS under the 25th Amendment. That speech to the Boy Scouts was appalling. Shame, senator.
Hatch has no shame at all
Put your money where your mouth is! Put Up or Shut Up
A fair and lengthy debate, or just a minimal going through the motions debate? Big difference.
No We do not #PutinTrump
