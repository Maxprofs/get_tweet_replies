She only knows and acknowledges her own rules. She's a stunning display of hubris. @SenWarren
this is an excruciatingly dumb tweet in a sea of stupidity. Kudos.
Possible! I'm just tired of her constantly attacking the wrong things, for popularity.
fair enough.
On another note, my son.
that's your boy?
meanwhile, as I'm sure you understand, just trying to help him make some kind of modest living with it all.
don't get me started on the Econ of the music biz. Thanks for supporting arts and artists.

This is the letter from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions that Mitch McConnell doesn't want you to know about http://thkpr.gs/d000a470c6b4  
And these are Rules for Senatorial behavior
DEFENDING A RACIST!!!
This is the letter from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions that Mitch McConnell doesn't want you to know about http://thkpr.gs/d000a470c6b4  
She got far more publicity for this.  Rather dumb move on the part of the GOP.
It didn't shut her up, it activated the human microphone.  She's smart-perhaps it was by design.
Then why were they so afraid of her speaking?
Interesting.  The vote came down to party lines.  I think one side is kinda looking scared.

Landslide? Now that's a joke.
@BretBaier Can't they extend it for her entire term??
"think of his wife"???  WE ARE!  Which is exactly why WE WILL PERSIST!  YOU - Climb back into the '50's!
GOOD! She is not just "nasty", she is downright DISGUSTING!
Sen.Warren GUILTY! Obnoxious! Rude! Disrespectful! Impugned fellow Senator-Rule 19. Founding Fathers demanded 'class'-she fails
total scanke scumgab.
misogyny
@ChrisBragdon too bad it won't shit her up longer. She is a waste of time & space!
oops I meant shut
Once upon a time, word was that Orrin had a dream he would be President one day. Now he's just the henchman.
How about even longer??!!!
senate version of "The Tomahawk Chop."
Warren, Pelosi and Waters the disingenuous trio. Back to the swamp I say!
Who cares what you say
ahh but Sophie, I care what you say/think.
@GarrettVentry Too bad they can't do that to Chucky Schumer.
Bullshit. These are rules Republicans have broken many times. It wasn’t about rules. Only an idiot believes that.
Does one have to be a liberal to want to hear Coretta King’s opinion about a racist shitbird?
Delete your account
I feel sorry for her Family? Can you imagine having to listen to her "all the time" legend is her own mind!
Happy Day! Sick of that neurotic S..t! Screaming 24/7! please do it again! Shame on Harvard for ever hiring her!
What are we hiding people, what are you afraid of? @SenatorSessions "bad" voter suppression tactics? #Racist
Good. Why a state would elect this Anti American @SenWarren to the Senate, is just baffling to me.
any surprise warrens appearance of the view after that, to complain that she was silenced, unfortunately only on the floor.
@BretBaier the more she speaks the more the world runs from the left, she is a total wacko


@GrammerSherry FIR?
It was 'flr' for 'floor'.
Got it Thanks
Warren is stepping into Obama void to become de facto Democratic Party leader.
That isn't exactly how a leader acts though, good luck libs if that is your leadership.
Exactly how a leader acts. Reading a letter from Mrs. MLK is the right thing to do.
Damn Right show that woman where her place is! You hypocrites make me sick
@BretBaier  good, she's pushed the limits on too many occasions!  She was horrid to DeVoss and Price.  Hell hath no fury...
My, did you know blondes can have Native American blood or even African blood? Science education is wonderful!
she parlayed whatever % Indio into the education you will never have
This made my week!
I know, it will NOT fill out.  What do you recommend - mustache only, chin only, neither?  Since you're the expert.
Which was total fucking horseshit. If she had a penis, she'd still be reading GOP trash like Green Eggs & Ham
and then male senators read the same letter without being banned. Wtf!? How is this fair?! #GodSaveAmerica  #Emoluments
@AngelaTC good. She talks too much does too little
Shame on you Sen Hatch for suggesting Warren not spk of Session hx, is a history of racism distasteful? You bet.
@BretBaier There is enough poison in the world. We don't need a drop  more. Shut up Warren. Snake 
"Rules against criticizing other Senators cannot apply when you are DEBATING THE NOMINATION OF A SENATOR!" — Senator Murphy
Now that republicans are in charge.  They don't want to listen.
Ted Cruz called Mitch McConnell a liar on the floor of the Senate, but wasn't silenced under Rule 19.
Senator Hatch you are a traitor to your country, stifling honest democratic discussion of about Jeff Sessions is wrong
But Bernie read the letter! Can we say feminism! I call bullshit!
"Benevolent sexism"  http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/2/8/14546960/elizabeth-warren-jeff-sessions-orrin-hatch-think-of-his-wife …
For shame.
@jarvon5 I wish we this rule would work with my kids.
They let the "male" Senators read the letter right after they silenced Warren.  As a woman are you offended?
@BretBaier there is a God..time to shut the hateful frustrated old bag up
Haha... I love it !!!
but y did he let a repub senator impugn motives of Schumer? either u silence all or none #LetLizTalk

@BretBaier Psycho faux Amerind.
@SenateGOP r afraid of anyone with brains speaking.
warren waters and Hillary are the worst of America offers they segregate people by color and religion
@BretBaier good!  Crazy freak of a senator!
@DearAuntCrabby Know your place woman! @lisajoybatt @nadianboone @NJTrainDelays @CNJ08540
@ChatterjeeTanni LET HER SPEAK.
@BretBaier , Wonderful News!!!
They should ban her from the planet.
@BretBaier voters need to bar her from walking into the building ever again.
@BretBaier she should be barred from speaking period. FUCKING phony
@BretBaier @MitchMcConell good for the senate! Good for America. #sitdownElizabethWarren
@BretBaier @really33956  FINALLY!!!!
@OrrinHatch So smart.  Vote to shut up a woman and vote a racist as AG.   Resign!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank God,for break from her nasty divisiveness! Sad human being, an off-kilter obstructionist to MAGA. Peaceful transition?
@BretBaier good
@BretBaier How about for the rest of her life. Works for me.
@SenOrrinHatch Trump is as thin-skinned as they come & McConnell is a known hypocrite & partisan hack. Now Hatch joins them.
@SenOrrinHatch This is a disgrace & all GOP senators should be ashamed. The "rules violation" is farcical & purely partisan.
@BretBaier enforcing rules. Wow
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!
thanks We can rest for a while !
Great news!!  Put a zipper on her and break off the pull.
that is so great.
@BretBaier @elizabethforma Maybe Sessions will hold Trump accountable like Holder held Obama accountable?  #hipocracy
@BretBaier Wonderful, let's get Senator Sessions confirmed right away!
Sen. Warren had a valid & legal right 2 read Mrs. MLK's letter. McConnell was trying to hide Sessions's racist background!!!
Sen Warren did not brake senate rules!She was unjustly red-carded 4 reading a letter written by Mrs.MLK http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/scott-king-1986-letter-and-testimony-signed.pdf …
Good
@BretBaier  
Voters need to silence her from office all together.
@BretBaier poor Pocahontas
@BretBaier hahaha
@BretBaier .
For shame @SenateGOP , for shame. You poked the bear, the majority of Americans. You can't suppress all our votes.
Once again Mitch McConnell proved why he's considered a master of the often arcane Senate rules, like Robert Byrd
@BretBaier thank U thank U thank U
Rats can't seem to stop, if minority leader had any chance, he would have made a deal with Trump. What an ass.
Good, Shut that crazy witch up!!
About time they put it to the libs. Hey loonies how does it feel? Get used to it
THERE IS A GOD!  
@BretBaier ha ha
@BretBaier owned.
This "gag rule" was introduced by RACIST SOUTHERNERS IN THE 1800's  hasn'tchanged.  @SenOrrinHatch
@BretBaier Thank God! Love it 
@BretBaier - Let's all be honest! She is a pain in the a$$. No disrespect to Mrs. King, but the letter was written in 1986.
@BretBaier bwa ha ha ha, they stifled Pocahontas   
@BretBaier  She is not above the rules. Why does she bring up his past AGAIN? We ALL have a past this was 30 years ago. MOVE ON
@BretBaier Dems=C.Schumer,N.Pelosi,E.Warren, BernieS.,M Waters,J.Brown etc. etc.Old Dems and their agenda Gotta love it.
@BretBaier why don't they impeach that bitch
@BretBaier can we make it for the remainder of her term?
She Needs Critical Thinking Classes also
@ForTrump the should have stoped her from speaking for her term and not let to run again
this is kind of action it takes to drain swamp! Let them have more of it! Lcb
& get our Congress back under control! By rule of law! Lcb
@SenOrrinHatch except this was supposed to be part of the congressional record you fool!
@BretBaier about time!
@BretBaier
@SenOrrinHatch you should be ashamed of yourself. Your morals should be better than this.
@MarieMa49685063 
@BretBaier good she babbles and never makes sense
@kstoneark since when did breaking the rules ever stop the Democrats. Hilary!!!!
no freedom of speech on the Senate floor?  She was only giving an example of why you should vote #NoOnSessions
- YAYYYYY!!! 
@BretBaier These people are anarchists .  We will not bow down to this crap.
@BretBaier JUSTICE finally???
Think she could give us some numbers? Like how many refugees is she caring for in her home ?

This is the letter from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions that Mitch McConnell doesn't want you to know about http://thkpr.gs/d000a470c6b4  
WOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO A VICTORY....small, but a Victory!
@BretBaier first time that dumb bitch has had to shut her trap I years.  Bwahahahaha.
@BretBaier
@BretBaier thank you god, she has finally shut up.
@BretBaier @elizabethforma can't speak in the debate, but we still have to look at her. Can McConnell do something about that?
@BretBaier BEAUTIFUL!  Now she has the time to take that trip with Thelma. Oh and Maxine Watters. Perfect!
@BretBaier hahahaha
Rules are rules - even for Democrats.  Hold their feet to the fire, ye ladies & gentlemen of the GOP.
@BretBaier at last!
Great news!
woop., can they do that for every hearing? Please please please?
@BretBaier tired of the Dems doing whatever they want   Like Obama they think they are above the law.
@BretBaier woot!
@BretBaier just being nasty.  I did not know her mouth even slowed down let alone was quiet
@BretBaier great news!! She's toxic and divisive anyway. Hopefully they fire her ass!
@BretBaier BREAKING NEWS: Speaking the Truth in the Senate will get you barred! @SenOrrinHatch
@BretBaier Warren is hectoring. A shame because Sessions is a good honest senator. He doesn't deserve her disrespect
@BretBaier Mrs. King isn't here to say if she still feels this way. Others have said they regretted voting no after knowing him
They let the "male" Senators read the letter right after this incident.  This was a disrespect to women
Thank You to our Senators.
@BretBaier mwahahahhahahahahahahhahaha
No wonder she is giving everyone a headache enough is enough
@ALK680 Big 
@BretBaier

U.S. Senate OFFICIALLY tells Elizabeth Warren:

"Sit down, and shut-up!"

That'll help her re-election campaign!
@BretBaier can we keep her quiet till the end of her term????
Um, Sen Warren doesn't speak with forked tongue?
@BretBaier God she's annoying
@BretBaier LOL! Good!
@BretBaier BEAUTIFUL!!!
THANK YOU..THANK YOU..THANK YOU!

Maxine Waters thinks Putin is advancing on korea!  PELOSI THINKS BUSH IS PRESIDENT!  LIBERALS ARE NUTS!
@BretBaier hey they just told Pocahontas to shut the hell up !
@BretBaier Awesome! Now if her constituents will just vote her OUT, we won't have to listen to her blathering any more!

Perdue on Feb 1, Cotton 5/25/16, Cruz 7/24/15. All three attacked Senators. None were shut down.

More GOP hypocrisy.
Unbelievable
@Brendag38323989

@IanPGunn
@IanPGunn LOVE IT!  @SenWarren is a freak'n bully!
@SenOrrinHatch  an ideologue that fit your agenda. The Republican Party has behaved in the most evil, corrupt fashion. You ask
she was able to read from what Ted Kennedy said, but not what a black woman said. Hope this goes over as well as I think
@SenOrrinHatch  gave us our voice for the SCOTUS seat. President Obama's term was 4 yrs not 3. You all held that seat to pick
I guess the dems will be looking for her smoke signals
@SenOrrinHatch said  "We want the ppl to decide." The ppl had decided Mr Hatch. We had chosen President Obama in 2012. That
