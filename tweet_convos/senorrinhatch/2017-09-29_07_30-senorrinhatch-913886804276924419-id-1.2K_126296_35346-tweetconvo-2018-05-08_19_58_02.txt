Even the ones who kneel?
#GiveToVeterans Retweet! 

Jake Tapper is an idiot but I would take the money and then spend it trying to defeat the forces of evil like CNN that actually revile us!
how about just give the money instead of turning it into a publicity stunt
I will retweet for the heroes... @jaketapper is NOT A HERO!!
Absolutely correct
You're a Liar, every dollar mean .05 for every Hero while the Fund raiser Pocket .95. Go away Jake.

Oh that was last September. Sorry
Can’t earn an audience so ya got to bribe one, eh Jakey?
You do not possess the integrity necessary to interact with any person in the US Military
"All Gave Some,Some Gave ALL" ...
I am going to hold you to it
Sorry, I don't believe you will give the money to Vets.  Will not donate.
Good cause by a journalist I once respected but who has drunken the alt-left kool-aid. Sad yet happy to support veterans.  #USNavyveteran
Fuck that. Tell us why we invaded Iraq? Cheney and bush should be hanged for war crimes. Fake ass patriots attacking the messenger
Keep drinking the Kool-aid.
I'll give to veterans without retweeting Jake Tappers tweets.

NRA's big spending pays off with clout and wins in Washington http://freshdosenews.com/nras-big-spending-pays-off-clout-wins-washington/ … via @https://twitter.com/freshdosenews
A worthy effort but @jaketapper has absolutely no credibility. Thus will not retweet.
Fucking hacks.
You totally blew that ridiculously biased and extremely disrespectful Town Hall but this is a good thing.
#give2veterans 

You got it!
A worthy cause-
But Jake Tapper of CNN said soldiers "died for nothing" & attacks the President w/lies-the Commander In Chief- Jake is vile
Trump is vile...and I'm beginning to believe that the people who "worship" him are vile, too!
#KILLARYFORPRISON. #POTUS
I despise your left wing propaganda but I very much respect your helping our military and vets. Thank You. May God open your eyes to Truth.
Yes, he has, which is why Jake stands 4 what he does. How's Trump doing?  Desperate Puerto Ricans finally getting some aid due 2 backlash!
Jane, take your 8 followers and tell the @dnc their scripted replies by paid trolls don't work on Twitter conservatives anymore. #Block
Thank you! My brother- a Veteran from Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq twice. He suffers from PTSD, and Traumatic Brain Injury. #give2Veterans
I agree and am sorry about your brother
Thank you. He is struggling.
I'm a Veteran with PTSD as well. Hopefully he is going to group meetings? Those seem to help a bit. Hypnosis for sleep... if any.
I will suggest. Thank you for service and advice.
Um no, he fought for our freedom and against traitors -not to force people to do anything. So, no maybe you need counseling for accepting it
I am a veteran who has been unemployed for over a year & a half. I have lost everything. We finally have an apt but r in desp need of a car
Do you know of any charities or organizations that are set up to help in my situation? Thank you for any info.
#give2veterans thanks Jake. All BS aside. I support any good cause
This is terrific
Why don't you just give them $500k...? @ChelseaClinton RT so I don't know if this could be trusted
Kyle, please.  Grow up.
Hi @jaketapper, UN-veteran of the Bosnian civil war here. Thank you so much for your work with @Stand4Heroes #give2veterans
Qocmjeubhru
Thank you from a #MilitaryBrat
Good shit Jake!!
You the man!
What is Stand4heroes?
Love ya Jake! #DoGood 
I have no faith the money will go where you say. #fakenews
Nice!
Don't like you @jaketapper but love and respect @Stand4Heroes.
No way Tapper is on up n up. Crooked lying evil lib.
From wife of a vet, daughter of a vet and mother of 2 soon 3 vets
Are you going to donate to veterans whining like little babies about kneeling during a song? If not, I shall contribute.
Great idea!!!!!!
Whos donating the $500k?
Janet to @jaketapper Stand4Heros
This is craziness. It is specifically one of the federal government's job to fix this wholly.
So now you "want" the Government to fix peoples' mentalities?  People are responsible for their own misdeeds.  Work on it.
Thanks Jake from a Disabled Army Veteran\Cancer Victor & mom of USAF Msgt & Glamma of USN MP HOOAH 
Good work, Jake Tapper!!!
Thanks Jake!!!!
Or you could just give them the money
How much of that dollar actually goes to Stand4heros?
They need much more. My 92 yo friend spent days sleeping on a deck of a ship to Normandy WW2, in a nurse home now and gets $133/mo for ptsd
His wife is 86 and she needs to sell everything they own and give up her 401k to get any help and she still is working to pay bills
The state will end up owning all they have and he gets $133 a month from the VA
Nursing home is charging her $385 a day, the VA said she makes too much money for him to be in a VA home, she works 18 hours a week teaching

RT #FlashMobAnthem RT
To #MAGA we may organise and meet at our gov. institutions & Flash Mob OUR ANTHEM.
DM & RT if U want to try.
…
Fake Tapper
Let's cross A Billion Retweets
And you will include the many veterans from Puerto Rico who stood up when @realDonaldTrump stood down with boney spurs?
You got it Jake! 
You rock, Jake!   Keep the "'tude".  From a USMC veteran.
P.S. Still a fan of your "earlier work".  
I can't any extra $ goes to murder unborn babies in IL. Forced to pay. HB40 Rauner.

@libbyajoyce
#ArmyStrongAunt
Or you could just donate 500K right now....
Where the hell are you getting $500k?
Happy to
Good luck with your viewers donating. As for conservatives we don't need you to tell us to donate.
Beware Democrat charity schemes. #ClintonCrimeFamily #ChelseaHubbell
Tricky way to raise campaign money Jakey! I will stick with Samaritans PurseDon't buy anything CNN is selling
Done and thank you!
Kinda being hypercritical aren't you Jake? Supporting kneeling and disrespecting our Vets and now this..

Dadson, brother 
How much did you personally give?
as a vet.. thank you, @jaketapper
Is Jake Tapper on the board of the stand for Heroes foundation in the going to steal the money like the clintons did?
I’ll retweet but I absolutely do not trust  @jaketapper or anything he says. Love my country and our veterans but Jake is off kilter
I retweeted, but exactly who is going to give the money?
learn more about the campaign here: https://bobwoodrufffoundation.org/give2veterans 
I read that there are are 100,000 US veterans in Puerto Rico right now. https://hispanicfederation.org/donate . Give to both!
Will this also stop #FakeNews ?

Would be much better if u were to go to Puerto Rico give your money all your resources away to help those that don’t have what u have idiot
It's shameful that we, not the government/military, have to do this. Our veterans should be taken care of.

Thank you Jake. You rock.
Is Jake Awake?
no I will not RT anything to help you line your pockets, you lying crook @jaketapper
Beyonce tweets a pic of her Shit gets 2 mil retweets.this has 60k smfh
Or you can just donate $500k on your own without the attention.
Probably managed by the Clinton Foundation,  no thanks.
Maybe Obama could have given vets that $400M instead of Iran. You guys and this selective outcry...
Let's go, peps.  My father served 40 years.
And you get how much of this? I get $.001 and you get? Don't gild you lily on "heroes" What if I'm not a "hero?" Do I still get paid?
No offense Jake, I want you taxed so you don't have $500K to give to vets because the government has already done so using your tax dollars
Don't trust him.
There are many vet organizations. Donate directly to them.
Jake wasn't asking for your money, but you can learn more about us, donate if you'd like, here: https://bobwoodrufffoundation.org

I'm usually quite harsh on you, Jake, for very good reasons. But I will fully support this. Bravo, sir.
Jake is like the devil who, suddenly, wants to put on white, fluffy wings!
Help jake buy off his guilt. No thanks

Way to go @JakeTapper, using your influence to make a real difference. Here's my RT for  @Stand4Heroes.
This is not for you. Not for CNN. ONLY FOR VETS. YOU ARE FAKE NEWS!
Good on you, Jake.
Thank you

Help me help you.
Just give the money and don't make it about your popularity.
Thank you, Jake! You're the best

Why are you ignoring Puerto Rico? You are showing your racism

Greetings from Germany 
Support Our Vets
How is this pic supposed to help the cause?

Hi RT=RT This PR, its a #humanity & #Justice case #thaarjustice https://twitter.com/thaar/status/908389665325056000 …
Iraq: Global Terrorism and Violations of Justice and Human Rights - http://presswire.com/content/1782032/iraq-global-terrorism-and-violations-justice-and-human-rights …
Or you could just #give2veterans without the social media ploy of getting you retweets and attention for it...

learn more about the campaign here: https://bobwoodrufffoundation.org/give2veterans 
Probably just going to his bosses at the DNC but I will chance it.
You could phone your parent company Time Warner. Jake to company generating billions: Can we spare 500k 4 vets? TW: Fuck that. Use Twitter.
I'm more of a power bottom
Hahahaha you know I married vanky cause her fam was broke, right? If anyone is doing the trying of someone else's our, it's me.
This is the only thing that would get me to retweet jack bag Jake's tweets.
Make the government support veterans, they're the ones who got them injured?
Bumping this up! Come on & #RT!

If Jake is paying, I say let's spend Jake's money on something good! We've got until midnight to do this!
Thank you Jake!! And God bless all who have served to protect our liberty.
Why don't we get money back from trumps veteran dept. leader who spent time vacationing & viewing 4 palaces /not working 4 vets /on our dime

Got ya.

I'd rather bypass Tapper and give directly to veterans organizations.
TY Jake
Or you could just give them the money instead of trying to promote your twitter page.
Jake, maybe there’s hope for you yet!!
So where do you stand on   and the Nat'l Anthem?
There goes joke virtue signaling again.

RT: Help me #give2veterans. Every retweet means a dollar for @Stand4Heroes, up to $500K, by 9/30. Let's see how much we can raise today!
Hey jakethapper best liberal lisp in the business!
Or... Just donate the $500k.
#give2veterans & #HelpPuertoRico
