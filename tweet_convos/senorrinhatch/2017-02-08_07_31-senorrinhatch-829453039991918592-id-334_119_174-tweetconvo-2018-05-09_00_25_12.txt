Obama wasn't nominating racists and unqualified cabinet members. If he had, I'd hope the GOP would have done the same
This is laughable.  As a #Nevadan my recollection is GOP obstructed for 8 years.  Try again.
Respectfully, @POTUS44 selected a higher caliber of cabinet picks. Please focus on qualifications.
Because Obama's picks weren't inexperienced billionaires with huge conflicts of interest. Sad.
because Trump's "Team"does not represent America or American values.  neither do you.
How are you going to talk about working with others when you didn't work with thousands of concerned Okies regarding DeVos?
DeVeos was a good pick. The fact that the Teacher's Unions hated her so much was a resume enhancement.
it's spelled, "DeVos", and, no, she was not a good pick.
The Teacher's Unions have done so well with reform, that's obvious.
Merrick Garland. Oklahomans above all knew his quality. You reap what you sow Senator. Hypocrite.

@SenDeanHeller how many repubs did Obama put in his cabinet? How many dems did trump put up? Most unqualified cabinet ever
Pls discuss your wrongful use of Rule 19 to silence Warren on Senate floor as she read Coretta Scott King letter.
This is historic because 45 selected the most incompetent, hateful people. Sessions has horrible civil rights record.
No, he doesn't. Quit watching MSNBC.
@SenDeanHeller Yeah, I don't know, guys. Maybe if Drumpf weren't picking such horrifying and incompetent people? 
1) history will be made, but it will be on side of election fraud and 2) 8 years GOP obstruction w/Obama
Yeah, you left out the fact that professionals were nominated---not losers from Dancing with the Stars.
@SenDeanHeller you fucking kidding me?! #DeVos and #Sessions ?! Try some decent nominees!
Are you going to vote to cut off funds for NPR and PBS?
@SenDeanHeller hypocrit, your party has no room to discuss obstruction. #investigateTrump #makeintegritygreatagain
maybe you can explain the numbers to us in person #dontdodgeus #whereislankford
Ummmm.... maybe because Obama wasn't bat-shit crazy?
@SenOrrinHatch because Trump is a loose cannon
@SenDeanHeller .U both aren't cringing in shock & disgust at twitler's choices?T is delusional  and/or punking us.DO RIGHT!
how many days did U WORK LAST YEAR? #'S speak 4 themselves. How dare you! HIPOCRYTE. Ya think?
PS: hire a new photoshop staffer.
not to mention possible insider trading violations by at least Tom Price if not others
Tom price is being paid off by insurance companies
OMG You are infuriating. These #'s don't matter. It's all about quality of the nominees! Is there ANYONE u would vote down?
Uh, Satan? Maybe. Obama? Definitely. #HRC too.
With all due respect some of the candidates & their lack of experience for those positions are the problem not the Dems.
#alternativefacts the #GOP invented #HistoricObstruction
We want nominees who respect the constitution and fellow man. Please follow suit. XO from Repub voter in NE Oklahoma.
what the fk did u ppl do 4 8yrs. Ur pathetic.
What does it take to get you to return a phone call from one of your constituents?
or hold a town hall meeting
BULL BALONEY! OKIES HOW CAN YOU STAND TO HAVE A SENATOR WHO IS UNTRUTHFUL! WHO STOPPED OBAMA'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE?
we are stuck with him, but not by choice, and every day we work on making this term his last. #BuhBye
because #45'S picks are grossly unqualified & full of hate. They also haven't been fully vetted & are ignoring ethics forms
And maybe listen to your constituents for once.
And let's not forget that NONE of his nominees are qualified. Quit your whining and do your job.
Obama doesn't have a cabinet in place until roughly April.
@SenDeanHeller That's what happens when we have historically incompetent and ethically compromised nominees. #historicmess
you're ruining oklahoma. You care nothing for our children or education with your yes vote of @BetsyDeVos. I'm ashamed of u
Bc of the lack of qualified nominees! @BetsyDeVos is the worst and your yes vote will not be forgotten come election time.
It's hypocritical to rebuke a lack of courtesy from D's when R's shirked Constitutional duties to vet Judge Garland.
@SenOrrinHatch That's because Obama and Trump are not the same President.
Like Obama's Supreme Court nominee?
Perhaps this is what it looks like when the majority of Americans oppose a sitting president's actions.
it was a swamp thing, "bro".  The swamp us going to collapse in on itself!
We want qualified people, and I'm not seeing any swamp draining at all. This is not what was promised.
@SenDeanHeller in 2012 wasn't until 4/28 until all confirmed? You're right, the numbers speak for themselves
they were well prepared and vetted--remember. but what about the party of "no" for the last 8 years?
@SenDeanHeller MERRICK. GARLAND. #shame #HistoricObstruction
.@SenatorLankford In 2009, the cabinet was qualified, and the president wasn't destroying our country's relations with the world
nope. Obama's cabinet not finished until 4/28. HW Bush on 3/17. Clinton's on 3/11. #alternativefacts
Read Facebook posts from constituents or close your page. #chicken
You must be "borrowing" your information.  4/28/09 Obama's cabinet. Don't lie as your leader does. #getthefacts
What about all that Republican support for Obama?What about draining that swamp?  #BS
what about the gazillion federal judges you howdy doody looking piece of gibbon feces?
Obstruction because we need qualified people. Trump has not asked for qualified people. I know we can do better.
@SenDeanHeller Maybe he should have nominated people that are actually qualified for the positions, instead of idiots.
@SenDeanHeller They are standing up for the American people and we applaud them. I.e. DeVos, Sessions.. #notinourname
what about President Obama's US Supreme Court nomination...
this is also untrue. You keep knowingly repeating this misinformation. You are lying.
I prefer government to move slowly. #HistoricObstruction seems necessary to protect from least qualified cabinet in history
@SenDeanHeller I think there were historic numbers that called you  to vote no for DeVos, but that wasn't enough for you 
Liar.
@SenDeanHeller Merrick Garland? Shutting down the Government? Obama will be a one term Pres? Projecting much?
@SenOrrinHatch the transition team drug its feet responding to the investigative of ethics refused to turn over documents
STOP LYING
what about other appointments that were obstructed for months or years?
RT @JenniferJ_Davis: "Obama's nom's were qualified, vetted & didn't seek to dismantle the agencies they were asked to head.
Obama's nominees were qualified, vetted and didn't seek to dismantle the agencies they were asked to head.
@SenOrrinHatch Maybe it's the terrible nominations made by POTUS that cause opposition from those who don't hate America.
@SenOrrinHatch You are not supposed to be a party line rubber stamp for unqualified nominees.
maybe because Obama selected cabinet members that actually made sense, and were qualified for their jobs?
@SenOrrinHatch Pres Obama chose qualified candidates. Trump just chose those who paid to get him in office,
historic list of unqualified, unethical, racist candidates is the reason. You are just a coward licking @potus boots.
@SenDeanHeller How long, exactly, did the GOP block Obama's Supreme Court Justice? Republicans are underhanded and corrupt.
@SenOrrinHatch How many wholly unqualified people did Obama nominate?
maybe if they were qualified it wouldn't be an issue. Kind of like the idiot you confirmed yesterday for Dept of Ed!
Historically bad nominees. You must see that, right?
Manup Carrot Top, Let us know when your next Townhall meeting is in Oklahoma. We have questions?
Antonin Scalia's seat on the SC has been vacant for around 363 days, so there's that.
@SenDeanHeller Seriously!  You honestly think these people are qualified? Scary if you do.
Obama's cabinet was not fully in place until April 28, 2009.
@SenOrrinHatch neat twist of the facts. I'm surprised your "religion" allows for.....oh, wait...#alternativefacts
Trump has picked literally THE WORST Cabinet candidate I have ever seen, Dem or GOP.
Because Obama picked decent, honorable people for the role, as any President should do. That is NOT the case here!
The numbers speak for people who desire competent public servants. You stood against OK education when you voted for Betsy
look who'$ complaining after 8 year'$ of mcCONhole & the ma$ter bla$ter t_RUMP perfecting ob$tructioni$m in the  senate...
Perhaps it has something to do w/ nominees & not the Democrats. How about we have a country run by experts?
then explain the 166 days it took to confirm Loretta Lynch for Obama's Attorney General...
The Dems learned from the best at obstruction. The GOP!  Maybe better Noms who complete paperwork wld help
@SenDeanHeller you know that Obama appointees actually completed their ethics questionnaires. And weren't racists
You are unbelievable that you can just lie so freely on TV!!
How about a historically incompetent cabinet not obstruction! @greta @JoeNBC @RoguePOTUSStaff @SenateGOP @SenateDems
when you're trying to confirm a guy that runs Hardee's - it takes time #youknowbetter
Repub Sens need to OWN their role in creating current govt standoff. Stop blaming Dems for your hypocrisy. #LetHerSpeak
When Billionaire donors are given cabinet positions they are uniquely unqualified to hold it hurts all Americans #DeVos
Sen. Sessions voted to gut the Voting Rights Act and then called the @NAACP “un-American.” Listen to OK and vote NO on JS.
Just wait you'll get yours when fracking causes your house to collapse. Keep voting against the EPA!
republicans refused to give Obamas nominee for Scotus a hearing for a year. They stole Obamas & Dems nominee.
Your numbers mean nothing in the context of the current political climate you helped create.
he does not deserve it!!
As a reuslt you show no respect for Coretta Scott King. You want to correct the tone, be decent.
Truth is neither impugning nor rhetoric. You are letting a documented racist become the US Attorney.
@SenDeanHeller maybe he shouldn't have picked horrible people. Make cabinet picks great again..
didn't you obstruct a SCOTUS nominee for a year. QPQ #DoYourJob
Historical Awful President & Cabinet Selections! #notmypresident #resist #Neverthelessshepersisted
It's because we don't BILLIONAIRES who bought their way into our government representing us because they ARE NOT US
Dear Dean Heller - #stopsessions! Uphold the values of our Consitution! Sincerely, #arealusapatriot
this is about protecting the American public, not a competition as you like to assume.
@SenOrrinHatch what about the numbers on their bank accounts? What about their historic conflicts of interest? Shame on you
@SenOrrinHatch You opposed and obstructed the nomination of Merrick Garland at every term... quit trying to be the victims.
@SenOrrinHatch Just look at the qualifications & experience of Obama nominees vs Trump nominees. A world of difference.
@SenateRPC  @GOP made a conscious decision to obstruct everything @BarackObama tired to do.
@SenOrrinHatch Sir no you did not work with Obama.
@SenOrrinHatch And then you went on to intentionally obstruct for 8 years. Put on your big boy pants and grow up.
@SenOrrinHatch you should be ashamed of yourselves.
@SenOrrinHatch get facts straight before you spout off with so called numbers...and Trump hasn't given anyone's voice back
@SenateRPC (1)Sir youve got some nerve. They didn't have a problem w/ them! They weren't completely sketchy as hell & ...
@SenOrrinHatch Like you gave Pres Obama the courtesy of working with him, confirming SC nominee, etc. Reap what u sow.
it is possibly to do with the fact that none of Trump's picks so far have been qualified. #HistoricInadequacy
remind me when Obama's team was fully confirmed and let's see who gets there faster.
I don't know where your getting your information at but Obama waited til April to get his cabinet filled..FAKE NEWS &SENATE
wait till the number reaches 8 years obstruction
Once again you PROVE where you allegiance lies. It is NOT to your COUNTRY. NOT to your CONSTITUENTS.$$$ & the GOP #UWORK4ME
HOW DARE you use the word "obstruction!" OBSTRUCTIONISM was the declared POLICY of GOP against Obama.
could be the incompetence of the nominees.
If trump has nominated people who knew what they were doing if may have gone faster. Instead he named disaster nominees.
Never let facts get n the way of a good bitch session from #libtards
please explain why you are confirming cabinet members that donate to you and your colleagues
please explain your confirmation of Devos
please explain your vote to silence senator Warren
@SenDeanHeller I don't believe you are tweeting this with a straight face.
maybe if they were actually qualified you would have more success
Where was the courtesy for Judge Garland?
Historically bad nominations!  We won't forget what you've done!
The reason why this is taking so long is these are not qualified candidates!!
They dont care about country or citizens. Only selves and gains and power.
@SenDeanHeller Obama didn't appointment racists, unqualified and controversial individuals.
well rev at least Obama picked people qualified for their jobs. Unlike Trump who picked corporate goons with agendas.
Republicans calling Democrats obstructionists. The irony.
quit tweeting. You're making a fool of yourself. #historicstupidity
@TheDailyShow Jon Stewart will haunt people for lifetimes to come.
historic also that we are witnessing a big ole national temper tantrum that begins with the elected Democrats in DC/state
Obama appointed qualified people. Trump didn't.  If you can't see the difference then you're blinded by partisanship!
@DeanHeller Thinking I could not be more disappointed & you retweet this bs. THEY ARE INEPT & you are showing you are too!
THE DIFFERENCE is Republicans did it FOR NO REASON. while the DEMOCRATS have GOOD REASON. Listen to the PEOPLE!
that's because Obama nominated competent people, not self serving assholes. Sad!
.@SenatorLankford The numbers speak for themselves.  They sure do.  Keep this up and you're out of office.  #standindivisible
.@SenatorLankford 1,151: # of days Ds have to wait during T's term for Rs to respect the right of POTUS to fill vacancies to the SC.
.@SenatorLankford 1,461: The number of days Dems should be willing to wait for the Senate to approve  Obama’s rightful nomination of Garland
historic only since Obama was in office and for EIGHT YEARS, he was done even worse with obstructionism.
.@SenatorLankford 8: Vacancies filled during election year. #HistoricObstruction #standindivisible
.@SenatorLankford 103: Number of Supreme Court vacancies filled by elected presidents. #HistoricObstruction #standindivisible
.@SenatorLankford 293: Number of days Republicans stonewalled Obama’s nomination of  Garland to the Supreme Court. #HistoricObstruction
your breaking commandments - lying, false witness
Perhaps if the nominees weren't racists, and billionaires, and grossly unqualified, things would go better? Just a guess.
this is laughably hypocritical. Everyone remembers Republicans in 2016 etc. Merrick Garland, much? Just to name one.
hahahahahaha Obstruction is what YOU did to Obamas SCOTUS pick #Resign #FailingOkla #YesILiveInOK
Have you been under a rock for the last 8 yrs? GOP the party of obstruction. Taste of your own meds! #GOPkillingUSA
historically worst nominees is the real meme here.
Merrill Garland was real example of obstructive #losingrespectdaily
It's because his noms are awful. Don't blame the democrats. Quit acting like you've never done anything wrong. #devos
yes, they say Obama made some decent choices for his cabinet and was organized in the process
It's not going to change either, but neither will we. GOD + ONE MAN=A MAJORITY!
