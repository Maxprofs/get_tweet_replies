Sen Schumer is criticizing Judge Gorsuch for lacking sympathy. Does he remember what he said about Judge Sotomayor in 2009? @GorsuchFacts 
One thing is very clear: If Judge Gorsuch isnt "mainstream," that word has lost all meaning. https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/gorsuch-in-the-mainstream-1486513094 … #ConfirmGorsuch (14/16)

due respect, @senorrinhatch... y'all know we can remember more than four months back, right?
and 1 yr ago, what reasons did the GOP have that were better than "everyone @POTUS looks at is under FBI investigation for Russian ties?"
three words.  Merrick  Garland  Bitch 
Um separation of church and state not good enough?
Trump can't appoint a Supereme Court Justice with less than a year left in office.(do your job, Impreach)
the spot should not be filled until the American people get proof of Russia involvement and the taxes are turned over.
@Punk1952 @senorrinhatch pal of Ted Kennedy, backerUSSR against Reagan, needs 2 either resign or back nuke option Better he retires now
What was your reason for blocking Obama's? You're all ridiculous. Time to clean house
.@senorrinhatch spectacularly hypocritical of you to post this with the spectre of Garland's nomination hanging over your head #gorsuch

this from those that did not respect our Constitution and from someone that accepted lies to Congress
Merrick Garland should have been confirmed. tRump is under investigation. He should be in prison.
Jesus- 'historic'?  Think back to #Garland.
I'll just add to the pile: remember Merrick Garland.
Don't talk about "the people" as if you care bc you clearly don't. Most of us are fine with "their reasons" This is all you
What reason did you give us when you would even hold confirmation hearing on Obama Pick,
The American people DESERVE BETTER THAN YOU - go live in Russia -
are you fucking kidding me? Do you think people have forgotten Merrick Garland?
because the President is a Putin Puppet
so Merrick Garland last year? You don't get to abuse this when it suits you. Shame on you.
Where was your reasoning last year with Judge Garland? #Hypocrite
Well, it is not historic because it has been done before. Quick question. Do you have Alzheimer's?
Reason for ignoring President Obama's pick for 11 MONTHS!?  You first sir. You broke the constitution. Fix it yourself.
You are a hypocrite and a liar.
R u insane? @realDonaldTrump is under fed investigation for colluding with Russia. What better reason is there? #Trumprussia
#NoGarlandNoJustice
How about this: McConnell said people should decide. 3 million more chose Clinton to make the pick. And she didn't have Putin helping her.
How about this: No lifetime appointments for a POTUS under FBI investigation for collusion w/a hostile power to interfere in the election?
hypocrite!  @POTUS44 deserved the respect to have his #SCOTUSnominee  Merrick Garland considered.  #StolenSeat
I will always remind you orrin that you need to be voted out. Sooner the better.
Dems are just taking a page out of the GOP play book. Don't like your own medicine?
The better reasons are that he is a biased person and not honest. It's that simple orrin
until we know we have a legitimate pres. no one should be appointed to the Supreme Court. We need #IndependentInvestigation
I thought blocking Garland from even testifying was "historic": why are you voting for a traitor's nominee?
.@senorrinhatch I can't hear you over the sound of Merrick Garland not getting a hearing or a vote.
It seems the new standard is a one year cooling off period before a justice can be considered.
GOP would not even meet w Garland. How dare u play politics w a KOCH & DJT under FBI invest U don't speak 4 American people
Merrick Garland.  #IfByHistoryYouMean2016 #GOPflop
Fuckheadmagoo, one (of many reasons): MERRICK GARLAND
You sir are a hypocrite. That is Merrick Garland's seat as you well know. Stuff your false outrage.
Your hypocrisy is, quite literally, breathtaking.  #MerrickGarland
Garland
there is one reason — Merrick Garland. Are you really this stupid?
You Hypocrites. Garland was far better, but you placed politics ahead of narion
This tweetstorm does not mention Merrick Garland. An innocent oversight, I'm sure.
#MEETWITHGARLAND
Historic? I think NOT! They are only following the example set by you & others by not confirming or considering Obama's nominee. #NoGorsuch
kind of like taking the historic step of refusing to do your job and give Judge Garland his due consideration. #GOPhypocrisy
Ok, only if u outline 16 tweets of why Repubs refused to vote on Merrick Garland. The people deserve your reasons. #Hypocrite
Merrick Garland Case Closed.

You and your @GOP colleagues are dishonest shitgibbons.
Hahaha! Good one! Oh...you're serious. Ok #TrumpRussia, Merrick Garland, Gorsuch's answers. Enough for you?
If Republicans were going to refuse Merrick Garland a hearing, the people deserved a better reason Biden Rule.
We never did hear the reasons for refusing to even hold hearings on Merrick Garland. What was that about double standards?
Easy peasy- you stole Obama's Supreme Court seat.
Yes, the people deserve to have Merrick Garland confirmed for SCOTUS.
LOL uhh what were your reasons for obstructing Garland? Was Obama under FBI investigation?  You're worthless.
Merrick Garland. Best reason. You Repubs. shamed yourselves, the Const., and your nation. & you're proud of it. Sickening.
y'all are some ridiculous hypocrites! When are you going to start putting your people before $$$ and money?
.@senorrinhatch #nope #stolenseat #StandWithMerrickGarland
This is a stolen seat. Republicans' hypocrisy knows no bounds. Stop acting stunned by dems refusal to roll over. #Garland
stop asking Dems to play by rules Republicans have shown themselves unable to abide by. Hypocrite.
how about president under FBI investigation for possible treason?
The arrogance of your hypocrisy is stunning.
Really? Like "We don't want to have a hearing on Judge Garland because the president is black"? Like that kind of reason?
Have you been high, drunk or both the last 8 years?
stop bitching Senator. He got a hearing. More consideration than the last well qualified nominee got.
Wait, didn't you all refuse to even have hearing for Garland last year who was appointed by a pres not under investigation?
Said the guy who supported Garland until Obama nominated him and then blocked him. Do better.
Do you really think this sad temper tantrum will make anyone forget how Merrick Garland was denied a vote?
the people have a great reason. The president is a criminal and being investigated for collusion with Russia
what were your's on Garland??
After blocking Merrick Garland from even getting a hearing, your tweet smells of hypocrisy
Merrick Garland on line 1.
.@senorrinhatch What's your "better reason" for refusing to even meet with Merrick Garland?
only one reason needed - you stole this seat from Merrick Garland.  Your partisanship was Unamerican in not even having vote.
I only need one reason: Merrick Garland.
remind me what your reasons were for denying Merrick Garland a hearing
stop embarrassing yourself. The hypocrisy of you and other members of your party is amazing. We will not forget!!
Republicans always counted on Democrats being civil..you have seen the last of that..fighting FIRE with FIRE now..hold on!!
OK..here it is you Republican bullies had the nerve to keep President OBAMA from giving his nominee ANYTHING!!
You must be kidding!  #Garland.  Does that ring a bell?  Seriously, who do you think you are kidding?
Merrick Garland. Only reason they need.
Uh, remember Garland?  Karma sucks, doesn't it. First, Trump should not be allowed to nominate anyone, under investigation
He sided with Company OVER LIFE also Trump & Friends under investigation can not know who to trust. No on Gorsuch
we have an excellent reason.. GARLAND
Merrick Garland
if he can rule against those of us thar actually work for a living, just remember, WE VOTE
the better reason: Merrick Garland

Did the @GOP have equally important reasons to refuse to consider an appointment for a historically UNPRECEDENTED delay?
How bout u all are trying to ruin our country & we're through with your crap! NO TO GORSUCH! Your days are numbered!
Merrick Garland
lol ummmmm Garland??  Short memory senator.
The reason is Merrick Garland, Senator Hack.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/powerpost/wp/2016/05/26/sen-orrin-hatch-reacts-to-meeting-with-merrick-garland-before-it-occurs/ …
Merrick Garland. It's just that simple
#Trumprussia is the reason #gorsuch should not be confirmed. Your President is under investigation for treason and corruption
hypocrite
oh brother...such hypocrisy.   All of you are quickly losing all credibility.   Enough.
The Supreme Court Unanimously overturned his rulings
the reason is we the people want Merrick garland in that seat.  We will vote out anybody who votes yes on Gorsuch.
And your explanation for blocking Obsma's nominee? Crickets? Am I hearing crickets?
open hatch insert foot: Merrick Garland ring a bell?
Merrick Garland u pathetic shill.
nope. You gave them good reason with Garland. Wake up!!!
were you taking a long nap during the Garland nomination?
What a hypocrite!
If Clinton was President and being investigated by the FBI you'd be blocking a vote for her nominee for SCOTUS.
because @SenateMajLdr STOLE THAT SEAT. That's good enough reason as any.
@chuckschumer @MaxineWaters No #Gorsuch confirmation until the #RussianHacking of our democracy has been investigated.
Putin's hand cannot taint the highest court in the land.
If the GOP refuses to respect the Presidency, they must be forced to at least respect SCOTUS.
.@senorrinhatch You were going to hold seat open for four years if Clinton had won. Entire SCOTUS shot down Gorsuch's legal reasoning.
this is all the LOLZ! Precious!
Sir, Repubs took historic steps to block a vote on Judge Garland, the people deserve better reasons. #gorsuchfilibuster
You are undeserving of that office you hold. History will remember you.
maybe you shoulda had a hearing on Garland?
Merrick Garland answer that
3 words you baffoon 

PRESIDENTIAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
#TrumpRussia
wow...16 tweets from someone who stole a SCOTUS appointment from a sitting President because he didn't like him. Stop whining
We have a better reason: Merrick Garland.
Merrick. Garland.
Merrick Garland... otherwise I can't hear you
Garland. (1/1)
No lifetime appointment while sitting President is under FBI crim. investigation for treason. And, oh yeah, Merrick Garland.
You should be ashamed for trying to ram this nom through before most everyone connected to the president gets indicted.
#MerrickGarland
how is it obstructing when they held hearings & will vote, they'll just vote "no", it's more than what you obstructionist did
You seriously have no credibility on this issue as someone who wouldn't even meet with #MerrickGarland. #StopGorsuch
oh really. Your hipocracy is stunning. #confirmgarland that was some historic obstruction.

No lifetime seat should be filled while the President and his admin. are under investigation. #investigatetrump
Some of us are worried about #russiagate, so no rush on #scouts. We've gone a year; let the investigation of #Trump play out.
Merrick Garland says Hi--you my sir are a hypocrite
Illegitimate nominee from an illegitimate POTUS.  We need an independent probe into the Russian debacle first.
Merrick Garland is still nominated for the seat.
ha ha, that is really funny. Remember what you did to Obama pick?
How about this:  Merrick Garland. That's the only reason I need.
Like the one you scalawags used against President Obama: Trump's in the final months of (his illegitimate) presidency.
you had no reason blocking Garland & Obama wasn't under investigation for Russian ties.  Illegitimate pres illegitimate pick
You started this mess by refusing to even meet with Merrick. Hypocrites get what they get. Payback.
.Senator Hatch what the American ppl deserve is answers on trump and Russia before confirmation. Make that happen no privilege for trump
2) enough to not even give Garland a hearing, this should be enough to delay/block Gorsuch appointment.
1)Because the POTUS is under FBI investigation for possible collusion with a foreign power. If an election a year away was
you are joking, right?  As I recall the Rs didn't even give YOUR choice Garland, a much better candidate, a hearing. #HellNo

Seriously @senorrinhatch I am the PEOPLE & I'm pissed about the crap y'all pulled with Merrick Garland. Your reasons were bogus then & now.
The American people do not want to #ConfirmGorsuch & the halls of congress r ringing with our phone calls. #MerrickGarland
what was gop reason for blocking merrick garland vote
Does the name Merrick Garland mean anything? You know, the same Merrick Garland you voted to confirm to the D.C. circuit.
by 'historic' do you mean that it repeats the GOP history of blocking Garland's hearings?
Oh, how about we have a potentially illegitimate President who is balls deep in self-serving relationships with Russia?
How's decisions against individuals, for corporations; giving rise to concerns abt dark money? Equal protection cms to mind.
