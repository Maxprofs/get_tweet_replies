@POTUS please name the dems so we can shame them.
McCain, Hatch, and many other current Rs voted for Garland the first time around too, if we're shaming
Garland is a good man. Obama is the problem 4 not allowing voters to chose. Election was about SCOTUS
so if there's an opening in 2019, should it go unfilled?
I assume you mean 2020. Garland nominated 2016. Answer, yes, it will again bring out the conservatives
so at what point in a president's term do they lose the right to have their nominees considered?
it's not written but I believe most feel it's not right in the election year. It's a moral not a law.
it's a new moral then, that's only been discovered in Obama's second term.
Questioning election results without evidence soon becomes suggesting we're better off without elections...
You libs went off the rails with not accepting the election! Shut up.
oh it was actually Trump questioning the vote tally, not Libs.
voter fraud is a real concern. dems were outright rejecting his election in the streets
voter fraud with no evidence huh? He's the only one questioning the vote tally.
There's proven voter fraud every year. not on a mass scale. no way 3 mil though
https://www.google.com/amp/www.usnews.com/opinion/op-ed/articles/2017-01-26/plenty-of-research-debunks-donald-trumps-voter-fraud-investigation-claims%3Fcontext%3Damp … people always come up basically empty
No way it's close to 3 mil. but like I said FL
@WhiteHouse good news  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain   for all Amercan citizens 
it's very important to have a good conservative #SCOTUS in America we face many unique challenges.
yeah like how to take away the rights LGBT people and miniorites and then claim to be Christians
those of us who believe that lifestyle is wrong have our 1st ammendment right against
you don't have the right to judge ppl and impose your beliefs not even in the Bibble
trump has supported the LBGT community let it rest
maybe government shouldn't be in marriage business
...it's nothing new
@POTUS who cares
#ShameOnYou
@POTUS They will not vote for him this time.  Sad!
Self promotion. #ShameOnYou
@POTUS rotten choice
@WhiteHouse This Judge Confirmation is going against the present laws and values in place.
Did they overlook something ..

@WhiteHouse This Federal Judge Confirmation has nothing to do with his '06 temporary selection. This is a lifetime!
But that was before America needed #SCOTUS to check #POTUS who is threat to the Constitution @ConstitutionCtr @RichardDreyfuss
if Schumer & Pelosi attack him, it will be the end of their careers, they will have their flunky handlers attack his character
Wron. We want dems to treat him like McConnell treated Obama. We should wait for the next president elected w/o VP
@POTUS great pick will make a very good judge best wishes
Merrick Garland.
The all out MSM Freakout will start as soon as he's done speaking #JusticeGorsuch #SCOTUS #SupremeCourt #SCOTUSnominee
well, he did call for a stop to a whole religion, say we should steal from others and promised econ from 1500s
I see what your problem is your stupid

Merrick Garland
@POTUS Merrick
Like the Clinton's you mean...
Mrs Scalia knows what's at stake — that's why she supported Trump for Pres and now Gorsuch for SCOTUS!
can wait until 2018 when voters can decide right.
how well do you handle disappointment  you may want to schedule that doctors appointment now
He's actually right as the Dems self destruct the voters will speak again!! #MAGA #SCOTUSnominee
you morons who voted for Putin deserve what's coming to you; the real Americans don't.
we're all REAL Americans.  Some just need to dig deep and act like one
some are real stupid unfortunately, see Trump.
.@GorsuchFacts Going to show us Merrick Garland's confirmation numbers? Merrick Garland facts are Gorsuch facts
@POTUS The climate has changed since then
@POTUS Isn't that interesting? Was Nancy Pelosi one of them? If she was she must have forgot!
Merrick Garland..... thats all
How long have you follow politics? Dems have done the same to Rep many time. By playing race card for all Supreme Court nominees.
what happens happens, If it were up to me, all nominations would be stalled as long as possible.
That was then this is now.
@POTUS @RepLouBarletta  the way he did it made the radical people worse! War is on your bosses hands
@ChristiChat I am so excited Mr. Trump the president came through for all the conservatives and evangelicals praise the Lord
and praise no one else! Just like Jesus taught!
@POTUS Merrick. Garland.
Sour grapes! In 80 years no POTUS has confirmed a Justice of SP in their last year before an election.
when was Justice Kennedy confirmed ?
Nominated 11/11/87 R Reagan, took oath 02/18/88 G Bush. Republicans. Prev twt applies 2 party change.
80 years ago the outgoing POTUS may have left the SC to incoming POTUS of diff party out of respect.
2
9
3 
Days. 
GOP refused a hearing on Garland.
This is a stolen SCOTUS seat. 
No hearings.
No vote.
thats not gorsuch's fault.
Wasn't Garland's either.
it was God's will!!!
@WhiteHouse Merrick Garland @DNC this can wait until voters can chose in 2018.
you mean white.
FACT: Merrick Garland was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals with bipartisan support 76-23 in 1997.
Fact Gorsuch was confirmed unanimously. Schumer and Pelosi both voted for him
- 11 of our dems already confirmed him in '06. Let's see why they opt to say no this time. Hypocrites!!
same reason R senators that confirmed Garland refused to even give him a hearing this time? KnowNothings!
-Yes, u r right.
@POTUS Hmm, seems Merrill Garland was also approved of.
Make your bed, #GOP, and then #lie in it.
Lame Duck Presidents haven't chosen a SCOTUS in 80 years, so suck it up buttercup!
You may not get one either. Can you suck that up? Or will you be whining about that too?
and 93 current Senators were in office when the senate refused a vote for Merrick Garland.
Appellate court NOTsame as Supreme Court.To imply because they approved b4 they should do nothing now is irresponsible
Merrick Garland was approved by all...Why is HE not on the supreme court??? Oh yeah, Repub UBSTRUCTION!!!
@POTUS I pray for the blinders of darkness to come off the eyes of those who oppose Trump and those working for him.
Some DEM operative on Tucker, said his mothers crime in the 80's disqualified him now.
http://occupydemocrats.com/2017/01/31/1-7-million-brits-sign-petition-demanding-parliament-ban-trump-state-visit/ …

Merrick Garland was confirmed with,I think,if memory serves,76-23 vote. He didn't get a hearing for SCOTUS. Why's that?
@POTUS Same is true of Merrick Garland.
How many women were consulted when he said they didn't need birth control?? #WeAreTheResistance
So sayeth the GOP who rewrote the rules of the Constituion saying the GOP is more important than SCOTUS and 365 days.
@POTUS what gives now. Dems just being obstructive. He was their pick 10 years ago. Short memory
How many of them were in office when the GOP stole the SCOTUS seat, by refusing to give Garland a hearing and a vote?
@POTUS And Judge Garland had a 100 yay vote. Yet the seat was stolen from him!?!?! What's ur point
The POTUS hits a home run with #JusticeGorsuch and the Dems/left cries foul. Finally a game changer is in play.
@POTUS None of that's relevant. He's a fine GOP pick for a future opening. This is Merrick Garland's seat, stolen by the GOP.
@POTUS So that was not a SCOTUS seat. BTW how many stalled Merrick Garland, another centralist & a fine man.
@POTUS @GorsuchFacts Don't normalize the GOP behavior +Pretend DEMS are being abstractionist. It's all well documented.  #GOPGetsomeEthics
How many GOPs would have actually liked Garland? We will never know will we?  #GOPhaslostitsway  #Unconstituional
Beautiful photo.
Errr NO THANKS!!!!  Keep your 'Fascism Forever' in the garbage!!
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4182852/Trump-s-SCOTUS-pick-founded-club-called-Fascism-Forever.html …
Go nuclear now.  Don't wait for them to bash a good man 
but what was happening before and up until that point?@gorsuchfacts
including Community organizer in chief, BHussein...
-real Americans are behind you-I'm a CO native-went to undergrad @ Greeley UNC & grew up in Littleton! you-stay strong
Alt left will block...Moderate Liberals will leave...2018...2020 will be evidence. MSM will die.
@POTUS what about almost 300 days dick Republicans wouldn't even meet with Obama's nomination
@perdue_alice - Vote these partisan hypocrites out of office who place politics ahead of the good of the American people.
@POTUS YOU REFUSED TO GIVE MERRICK GARLAND A HEARING..SO NOW WE GET TO SCREW YOU....
@POTUS The same can be said for #MerrickGarland What's your point? #StolenSeat
So?  And Garland?
.@GorsuchFacts .@POTUS Misleading statement. Lest we forget:  No role call by Sens, procedural voice vote that is registered as "unanimous"
@infocyde yes, and if, these same politicians, vote him down, it will be Party Politics. Hypocrites!
@WhiteHouse merrick garland = unanimous
@POTUS Now Dems will oppose him solely because he is nominated by President Trump.  The Dems are so shallow and childish.
@POTUS Fact....Judge Garland should have had his vetting and confirmation. #Filibuster
@Non_MSM_News trumptastic
@POTUS
@POTUS  Obama's  nominee did not get a hearing. Let's have  2 hearings, best man wins
@POTUS That was federal court. Supreme  Court us different
@POTUS we had a sane President then. @SenateMajLdr didn't do his job. Failure #TheResistance wait for next fair election
@POTUS GOP also liked Garland, but no hearing because the black man nominated him. Double standard much?
Well this is 2017...
@POTUS do you really have your own check mark on your handle?
@POTUS https://youtu.be/2Z9M8H5F9cw  Merrick Garland was qualified too
how many when @MerrickGarland_  was confirmed? @GorsuchFacts  #SCOTUS #JusticeGorsuch should've been #JusticeGarland
this doesn't matter to Democrats, they are all about revenge!
that's before the Democrats all turned into Marxists.
PussyGrabberInChief; not going to happen. No Dem will swallow GOP swill & vote 4 police power/Marshall law. #NoGorsuch
so what?
@jkvanmeter there in lies the problem career self serving politicians who know " whats best for us"
@NannieNelson64 a man of the constitution 
An excellent choice by @POTUS 
America greater by the min
Hate2 miss 1min of news
It's so sad how the 'game' of politics matters more to the left than our great country!!!
@POTUS you made a Awesome pick.President Trump..Thank you sir and God bless
Hmmm...
So what.
@BGiampolo Wwe know! The Democrats areEVIL and just wanting to be thorns in Trumps side.God will prevail! Gosuch will go thru
The former acting Attorney General was confirmed, too. Apparently confirmations are on a situational basis.
it's impossible to keep a good&just man or woman down!(SsG'sW)

Gorsuch cites Kissinger in his Columbia yearbook: "The illegal we do immediately, the unconstitutional takes a little longer." (oy) 
but u hve t allow time f @SenSchumer's flood of real tears
that was 10 years ago. have to look at what he's done since then
Why would you want a stolen seat? There will be an asterisk on your robe. Forever. #MerrickGarland
@POTUS  lots happen since then. Times change. Does mean he is qualified to a Supreme Court Justice now.
@Koxinga8 @FoxNews 
AMEN  God bless you Hon.Gorsuch.
@CSims45 it does not matter who the pic is, Democrats would have opposed. If they let Trump succeed they will be obsolete.
just like president Obamas nominee which was blacklisted by damn uncooperative GOP.
boy the trolls are out today ,
GUESS HES NOT AS BIG A THREAT TO DEMS AS JEFF SESSIONS!!!
G-d bless you!!!!
We The People call on these 11 Current Democrats to break away from Senator No & The Obstructionist so an indisputable pick. 
How many current senators opposed Judge Garland?
Cheers! #AmericaFirst
@POTUS things change! Isn't it what you want. You can't take us back to the 1950's
completely different job.
If Dems don't stop their senseless division they will loose the Dems that voted Republican Trump forever.
Awsome!! Keep the momentum going Mr President
@POTUS Why not, the Republicans would do it
Merrick Garland was also appointed with out opposition, where's his well deserved SCOTUS seat.
@POTUS watch the dem hypocrisy & historical rewrite begin. May truth prevail over abomination!
@WhiteHouse But I'll bet some will change their tone now
Merrick Garland.
Fantastic. Now he can get in line behind Merrick Garland
but that was for a lower court.
we know their rebuttal "hobby lobby"
@POTUS who cares?
@WayneDupreeShow Should be not different today. It's time to show some solidarity among the parties.
#MerrickGarland #SCOTUSnominee
Merrick Garland.
@WhiteHouse Supreme Court very different. Remember Obamas suck it up put ur big boy pants on Snowflakes Not happening. TOOBAD
Joe Biden is the one that argued delaying supreme court pick in 1992.
That was then, this is now and here's hoping a BRIBED JUDGE will never sit the court.
@POTUS He wasn't a threat back then an adult was in the White House. This is too big an issue to give to someone Fake presi.
Including Schumer, who voted for him.
@WhiteHouse Exactly the same can be said for Merrick Garland. What's your point?
@POTUS now lets watch @TheDemocrats be predictably hypocritical & obstructionist #DemsAreDone @NancyPelosi @chuckschumer
Similarly that didn't stop @GOP from obstructing Merrick Garland for the last 300 days of #44s term #SCOTUS
@POTUS This is a suspicious account. How and why does it have a blue check? It only sings praises and is retweeted by @potus?
Garland is first in line. FACT.
https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-nominee.html …
He wasn't trying for a stolen seat.
That was then, and this is now. Democrats should #RESIST EVERYTHING #TrumpleThinSkin does. 2018 is coming! #TheResistance
and Garland was widely praised too. Sessions was shown as a racist in the past, that not matter?
NAIVE VOTES...AND GIVEN WITH NO MUTUAL RESPECT..
@POTUS 98 senators voted for #Garland . Take that fact.
tough! No justice for drumpf until tax returns.  Obstruct the putin puppet
President Trump and the people of the United States believes in you Judge.
@POTUS Hilarious that you had to retweet facts!! Oh, wait..that's because they are FACTS!!!
#irrelevantfact , because he did not have an official record at that point.
well now we know why - no opposition
things that make you go hmmmmm
Clair McCaskil already has someone running against her Calr Edwards she's lost her job w/missing all these hearings
funny how Democrats moaned because the President took to long to pick cabinet now they delay his picks
That was before te Rep completely blocked the Obama's pick. So your bullshit attempt is pointless! Despicable
@POTUS your guy gets same treatment as obamas no vote!!! #donnythepuppet
So many Dems have lost their way
@POTUS Rick Scott must go
and your point is?? this is 2017 nothng like living in the present..
Of those 31, how many are up for reelection in 2018?
@POTUS while I understand the point of this, it tells me there are 31 legislators who have been in DC too long! #term limits
@POTUS What has health care it's been returned for full control to insurance companies without preexisting conditions
Different days then sir.  If DEMS are blocking it's because they are responding to constituents. I support them
love what you stand for. Your background, & understanding of the constitutions. Our country needs you, Big time TY 
Garland was equally qualified. It's unclear why he was not afforded a hearing as all other nominees. #MAGA  #SCOTUSNominee
@POTUS they are golden Sach bankers who got Golden shower handshakes after for closing on millions we don't want them no way
10 years ago with different people in office. Different opinions. Always using outdated facts like 9/11 for you "ban".
@POTUS following Obama?  might want to unfollowpotus and  flotus 2017, wouldn't want to give them a false sense of acceptance
@SenOrrinHatch Hey Orrin I hear you're sick of this crap. Do you remember MerrickGarland??3mil Americans do  we're angry
@SenOrrinHatch - but then: Merrick Garland.
@POTUS Endless whining and complaining! You got the attention you wanted Stop! Most humiliating prez ever. #diarrheamouth
@Veteran4Trump however that was before dems were overtaken with fear and cry spaces because Clinton lost
@POTUS watch how fast those 11 jump the fence and start the attack
let's wait for the majority of the country to vote for who should appoint the next justice. Asswipes
So, let's see, that's 31 in the swamp that should have been gone long ago. @GorsuchFacts @POTUS
11 current Dem Senators & 20 current GOP Senators were in office when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed w/out oppo in '06. #JusticeGorsuch #SCOTUS
Any of which fail to support Judge Gorsuch now will expose their political hypocrisy! Exactly why I left the Dem-P in 1985.
