Pitbull lends his private plane to transfer cancer patients from Puerto Rico: "Thank God we're blessed to help." http://eonli.ne/2hyahCy  
Congress has a role to play here as well, and as @SenateMajLdr said, we're working with the admin. to do so ASAP.
We want those in #PuertoRico & #VirginIslands to know that we'll continue to work w @FEMA @DeptofDefense & the Admin to help in the recovery
Great to see the LDS Church’s efforts to help in PR as well, detailed in this article in the @DeseretNews — https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865689733/Heartbreaking-Evacuating-Puerto-Rico-Mormon-missionaries-reassigned-all-over-US.html … #utpol
As the article notes, Hatch is working w/ the church to ensure missionaries can travel wherever necessary https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865689733/Heartbreaking-Evacuating-Puerto-Rico-Mormon-missionaries-reassigned-all-over-US.html … #utpol
While your hero Trump was golfing....
Worldwide? Muthafucka Puerto Rico is US!
@MsCleveland2 @enews 
@pitbull DONATES use of pvt plane for aid
Trump delays aid
Trump aide uses pvt plane
It would be nice to see our government step up. Do you know anyone who could help with that Mr. Senior Senator of the Senate?
#WaiveTheJonesAct now!!! Help these citizens.
Such an hypocrite that Senator  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING TO PASS A PACKAGE AID FOR PR AS YOU DID FOR TX AND FL . IT HAS BEEN OVER A WEEK. I FORGET THEY ARE HISPANICS OVER THERE . Sen Hatch you full of B.S
Let people know that there are already boots on the ground, help is there, has been there & delivering help.
This government hasn't been doing anything but "assessing". People are out of water to drink and are drinking from streams.
I just retweeted a bunch of tweets & videos from people on the ground. Lots of miscommunication all around.
That's the American spirit right there.  No complaining, just action. 
Maybe like the government should be the ones stepping up? Just a thought
So 24hours That's when bulk of helicopters, aircraft arrive AMERICANS RESCUED Then 48hr for @USNSComfort arrival 4-5days 10ships
Remember Puerto Rico doesn't vote in the Presidential elections nothing in it for Trump.
A musician is helping Americans in need of healthcare while you, an elected official, order disabled advocates to be dragged and jailed.
Is it time to impeach Trump yet? 100’s of examples to pick from... leaving Americans to die in PR is at the top of list? Maybe RUSSIA?
Maybe someone would announce TIME LINE: helicopters arrival to start rescuingWhen @USNSComfort arrival w/Medical careWhen fuel distributd
Yeah Senator, why is USGovernment so slow helping PR and the Caribbean?  If private individuals can do it then this country can be better.
Lent his private jet  what a swell guy.  I hope he's able to survive without it 

Remember how Sen. Hatch changed the rules of the Finance Committee to get Price confirmed? They knew he was unethical—didn't care.
Honorable 
Congress unable 2 act quickly to help US citizens bc UR propping up incompetent @potus who's distracted by NFL and likely2start nuclear war
Thank goodness that Pitbull was able to get across the "really big" ocean to Puerto Rico. Maybe he could draw POTUS a map or a chart.
This fucking gouv can’t even send a boat. While a Royal Caribbean ship just dock full of food and supplies
Thank you Senator Hatch I bet you helped the Pentagon take action & deploy all we have to help 
 & @SenJohnMcCain & @USNavy
Thank goodness for the private citizens stepping up to the plate because @potus is more concerned about tweeting re:  than US folks dying
Especially since @realDonaldTrump doesn't give a shit about you
Thanks to all that are helping with Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands! #45 was very late with his response and help! So sad!
45 is not very late HE IS COMPLETELY ABSENT
Tell Trump to stop wasting taxpayer money on his travel. Stop trying to take away healthcare while gifting your friends huge tax breaks.
I'm not even sure who you are anymore. I've never been a fan of yours but I respected your patriotism .Trump must be impeached.What say you?
That is awesome and all, but what are you, congress, and the president doing?
It’s SAD that you’re thanking a musician instead of our “billionaire president”. Let THAT sink in.
Trump owed 33 Millions $ in back taxes to Puerto Rico what he us waiting to pay back. The Senate should indict him. We have a criminal for President and the GOP don’t give a shit. Maddof stole as Trump did
How the elected congress can allow Trump 2 stay in office & actually live w/themselves - beyond comprehension.  Oh right, tax cuts. #impeach
Thank you @pitbull, now @gop waive the f-ing Jones Act!!
Yes thanks to @Pitbull because we can't rely on the #junkyarddog in the WH. Taking his personal vendetta out on PR is PURE MALICE.
Thank the good Lord for ppl like him. 45 could give a Rats Ass about REAL PEOPLE
BS
Best part of my day, realizing Orrin Hatch knows the nickname Mr. Worldwide!
Yup, Mr. 305!!!!
@pitbull @JLo @mcuban @MarcAnthony and the many other celebrities that stepped up way before our sorry excuse of a president. We commend U!
Bravo!! @mcuban too. Honor, character & integrity, doing the right thing, while others who are empowered lack moral compass to do likewise.
I show love to those who show love.
Lol, asap!!!. Why don't u guys lend one those private jets
Because our shit bird of a President won't
If there were another rich person (like a billionaire) to do the same.
Is it true @USNSComfort is on its way to Puerto Rico Would anyone please make an announcement ASAP @USNavy 
USNS Comfort is still in Norfolk. Supposedly being outfitted for departure. Still at best 7-9 days away from #PuertoRico
Grrr but thank you for updating me. It was 109 degrees yesterday in Puerto Rico Mr Hatch We must get to the WEST SIDE OF ISLAND TOO 
My favorite tweet of the year!!  Thank you Sir!  Did you know Puerto Rico NEEDS MORE AIRPLANES TO TRANSPORT AMERICANS OUT 
@realDonaldTrump is a useless racist and you ALL are complicit to his inaction! @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
Can you get Tom Price to send his private jet?
It’s Sad That The Celebrities Are Doing More Then Are Own Fucking Government Agency’s...
@Cgriffin3323 dale !!!!
I decided a year ago I don't hate him. He's a decent 
Who are "others"?
You guys have sat by and watched this president do NOTHING to help Puerto Rico. This isn't just Trump's disaster, but yours as well. Shame!
Very good point!
Nicely done Pitbull.   Now if other bitching, liberal celebs could just out their  where their mouth is!! 

w/little or no asst from Fed govt. That's #SHAMEFUL, @senorrinhatch !! But TYs to @SenJohnMcCain for #JonesAct effort
You know what's super cool about all this? @pitbull didnt feel the need to announce his actions he just helped to help. Big  very touching
Doesn't seem to be Congress's nor the #IdiotInChief's priority, Orrin.
Good job @pitbull thank you for your kindness
Real #Hero's save Life, they don't take it!
Wouldn’t have to do this if the Government stepped up to help its citizens.
Is it crazy that @pitbull is doing more than @POTUS ?!?! Shocking, I'm sure.
TBH, it really isn't shocking. It's what I expected of dt, a do nothing pino, unless it benefits him in some way.
You have access 2 the military 2 help our citizens. tweet @ them. In case you have forgotten, as a senator you can ask Congress 4 help.
Hey, Office. How you been? Just wondering when Hatch'll kick fellow Hill occupants in the ass so they'll also act to help Puerto Rico.
Such a humanitarian thing to do!!
Why don't we have more boots on the ground?
What have YOU personally done to help Puerto Rico, Senator?
(And why is it taking longer to help PR than TX and FL???)
Saving lives! You are a fantastic!
Awesome stuff
Thank you!
@pitbull stepping up and doing Puerto Rico a solid.  Gotta love that!!!
Thank you.
If @potus and Congress won't send a emergency humanitarian response. Thank goodness for @pitbull
Who says @pitbull s are mean and savage. Nothing expresses the nobility of the spirit than men who help w/out being asked. Good man
All the pitbulls I know are quite loving & affectionate. It's mistreatment that makes them mean.
