You are not representing your voters and the true citizens of this country! Shame on you!
You are not representing your constituents with your stand on DACA! Shame on you! We don't agree with your stand on Transgenders either!
I believe we should have a permanent solution for dreamers let's send them home as our current immigration laws state.
Once their families are home they can file to immigrate through legal channels. The only fair way for all immigrants.
The constitution does not regulate immigration and puts the responsibility in the House of Representatives.
Once the house passes the bill it proceeds to the senate. If passed in the senate it lands on the president's desk.
However, the one requirement for it to be constitutional is that the law must be fair to all nations.
Do you job now.....stop giving posturing speeches
I know many who've been waiting for the lottery.  Why should illegals get a leg up over ppl wanting to come the right way?
Did those children have a choice?
So why didn't they apply for legal status?
Because they can't. Perhaps you should understand what you hate so much. They would have to return to a country they dont know and wait
The skills they learned in the USA illegally are needed in their home countries.  EU ppl are moving to SoAm for jobs. So can Dreamers.
Lol, yeah. When did your family come here and take someone's land.
Let them stay and make it easier for law obliging  people to immigrate.

Why couldn't you find a permanent solution before Trump repealed DACA...What a mess
DACA was a 2 1/2 pageDHS memo. We are a nation of laws, pass it as a law
Coretta Scott King spoke out against Sessions, @SenWarren tried to remind you of this, you censured her. Then you, sir, voted for him. SHAME
NO ILLEGAL should be receiving TAXPAYER FUNDED BENEFITS..NONE! WE are TIRED of WORKING to support ILLEGALS!
ACT. Please do something!
Saying the right thing is easier than doing the right thing. When will you and your colleagues actually take action?
Thank you @senorrinhatch for supporting #Dreamers and seeking a permanent solution.
With your stand on DACA and Transgenders, you must have been bought off by Obama and Soros .You are not representing your constiuents! Booo!
do your job then, enough of the talk, put up a bill and lets see how the R base responds
We #TheResistance will fight to #ProtectDREAMers & anyone who tries to harm them!
Whenwill GOP put COUNTRY 1st?
#ImpeachTrumpPenceNOW
Let's see if you have the common morality it takes to actually do something without some kind of corp kickback or a job for one of your kids
Its time for Congress to get working, no more excuses. Pass Tax reform, build the wall, back @POTUS You work for the American people.
They know they do.  They see Trumps abysmal Approval Ratings too Sherry.  That's why many will not go down w his Titanic
Again, The need to fix the root problems are the answers.  WHY are there people coming to the US illegally?  That is the question. #RESIST
Agree @senorrinhatch there is good that has come from #DREAMers. Congress must fix immigration laws, enforce and do this with compassion!
Will you vote for its passing @senorrinhatch ?
46, #ImpeachTrump
You and the rest of the @GOP better put this boy in his place. Hitler had one third of the vote, and a COWARDLY legislature. #stoptrump
Exactly
Serious question.  Why aren't you President yet? Can we please rush the process?
Then grow a set and do something.
Thank you for supporting these kids who call America home.
If you want DACA to be continued, u obviously either don't understand or totally agree with its entire scope. Either way, time to retire.
Note: I went to Tuskegee, not Auburn.
We're counting on that path to citizenship. We didn't choose where we were brought up. I'm white, 67, raised in USA. Doesn't make me better.
If U only worked w/ Obama & the Democratic Party on this the Dream Act could be in place.  U were more interested in obstructing. SAD
So you want to kick them.out until you take another 38 years to do nothing? Paid of course.
Words mean nothing, the @GOP cannot be trusted.
Please work on getting your colleagues to find their hearts, and remind them how compassion is supposed to work.  Thank you.
Just #ImpeachTrump.  Do your job.  Besided #DACA there is the fact that @realDonaldTrump is unstable.  Will you wait until he kills us all?
I think that we have some responsibility as a nation... because we allowed the illegals to stay for decades without doing anything about it
Now 20 years later.  after we have educated the kids want to send them back to a country they don't know, is just cruel and unconscionable.
President Hatch
GOP Strategist...
Republicans should be thinking long & hard about the message that's been sent to Hispanics w/ Arpaio pardon & now DACA. Big problem.
Do the right thing for once.  Republicans are looking a lot like racists.
There is nothing American abt. ending DACA or @realDonaldTrump .. no humanity,compassion, values- Another cruel slap in the face to America!
All talk. No action.
Too bad you & @GOP spent 8 yrs undermining Obama instead of working for America. Imagine what you all could have accomplished 2gether.
You need to stop carrying Trump's water. You've done enough damage to our country.
You'd better find a way to KEEP our DACA kids here, and it better NOT include that IDIOTIC WALL.
the average age for DACA is 20 & 30's. Of course these adults should have to become legal citizens. Ridiculous to not make this happen.
All of you old men are out of touch with America. Please retire.
Yet for 8 years ALL of you sat on your hands and did nothing to change anything!! This falls on ALL of you!!! NOT Trump!!
Tax reform? Nope. Repeal Obamacare? Nope. RAISE Act? Nope. Kate's Law? Nope. Dreamers? Let's spend all our time on this!
Just impeach the guy, Senator - you will go down in history as the guy who did the right thing. Save us!
Not a trump fan. but agree on this one. We need to look after our own first!
#DefendaDACa dreamers are exposed group of people who need protection now. Sick of your talking; do something, you’re creating turmoil.
You better get this shit right. These are people not toys.
Then do something. How many years has this bullshit gone on? Red tape and money.
Sen Hatch has $4 million dollars cash on hand - he's been doing something, but it's not benefited very many people.
And the drain on our communities?
Hey Hatch! ...You are becoming a Softie! You need to Toughen up !!
14 Things the MSM Won’t Tell You About DACA
Exactly. If your parents don't pay the rent it's the landlord's fault when you're evicted.
Jim Crow is back soon there will be Whites Only Bathrooms again
So much rhetoric, from an embedded politician, who is a member of a do nothing body of Government!
We saw them Burning  the  at Trump rallies attacking US citizens while waving the  Flag
Congress needs to pass a bipartisan solution. A permanet path the citizenhsihp for DACA and their families.
Focus on Americans, not illegals
