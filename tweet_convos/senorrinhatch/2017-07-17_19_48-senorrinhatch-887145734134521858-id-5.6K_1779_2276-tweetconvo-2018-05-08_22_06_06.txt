You are pure evil. How many in your home state will lose their insurance if this were to happen. You need to lose your job in 2018.
Look at the polling. Americans want ACA fixes, not a repeal. Work with your colleagues across the aisle. Collins wants to, McCain as well.
And how's that working out for ya?
It'll get worse!
Can we repeal your job in the Senate and then replace you with someone who’s not an evil party-before-country snake?
Hahahaha McConnel didn't like the responses he deleted the text!
You are @realDonaldTrump puppet!
Why are you such a monster? I'm asking that seriously.
You will be remembered as the guy who took healthcare from millions. You are not pro-life.
The truth.
The idiocy of #KY voters to keep you in office is beyond me. #ACA
Seems irresponsible to me. You can't pass a replacement with no risk of filibuster. But sure you can get it done with Dem help? lol
If it's so failed, why did Senator McCain have medical care now instead of waiting?
He has been threatened by Obama and cant be happy until it has his shit on it.
Is it hard being such an awful human being or does it just come naturally for you?
I wish he, Cult45 & GOP lost sleep the way mothers like I do with a child with life threatening illness. But they probably sleep just fine.
You do realize it is in yours and your child's best interest to repeal and replace asap, right? ACA is not sustainable or workable.
You do realize that GOP are trying to get rid of coverage for pre-existing conditions which will help NO ONE. repeat NO ONE.
If I had a car accident could I go get insurance after the fact? Pre-existing conditions can never work. Ever! It's a ridiculous idea.
What if an insurance company refused to give YOU insurance because you had survived cancer?
The only acceptable pre-existing condition law would be if you have maintained insurance they cannot drop you.
What if through no fault of your own, you lost your job & couldn't pay the premium & got canceled? That happened to a lot people in 2008.

I hope he haunts you in your dreams tonight.
You are inhuman.
you're a craven political monster.  #Obamacare is a lot more popular than you will ever be.
You do know that the majority of Americans including Republicans want the ACA, wgen then ran on repeal most thought Obama care wasnt the ACA

Thank you was looking for one of those!
The way you wrote bill, with shit hitting fan in 2036, you made sure you'd be long gone when the REALLY bad stuff kicked in. You sick mo-fo.
total #repeal only answer . #noleadership #spineless #dontfundinsurancecompanies #goaftermedicalcost #bureaucracy . @senategop @potus
the middle class cant afford this much longer lets get it done! who shall we bombard with emails????
You sir are an evil man.
This administration sucks. Dump Trump!
How about statement on the status of the #DVAScandal? #PullKushnerNatSecClearence or set a negative domino effect contrary to NATSEC #Feres
Your ins and health co lobbyists won't win elections for you. Drop the dumbshit big gov soln and act like free market conservatives
You need to retire. You're an evil embarrassment to this great country.
The history books will not treat you kindly. Your grandchildren & their grandchildren will learn the depth of your treachery & cravenness.
LOL ok
You DON'T support working families. We will remember in Nov 2018!
Poll: Independents support sliding for Trump http://on.msnbc.com/2ux0C74  
Who cares what you say Skelator, you will get to kill poor children and hand millions to the rich. We know, stop your bs.
Well, you are beholden to your corporate masters.
When you are going up hill but can't make it to the top...
...then decide to take the white water rapids on with a canoe and one paddle...
...then fail, still hike along the rapids to a water fall, then try swimming up a water fall like salmon...
Is what the @GOP is doing with healthcare
You had seven years.
YOU & @SpeakerRyan ARE TERRIBLE TOGETHER 100% . GROW A SET, GET THE OTHERS ON NOW! @POTUS HAS DONE ENOUGH. 8 yrs, NOTHING! 
Does it bother you at all knowing the people of this country don't want this?
Would you also starve children so they would rejoice at the week old bread and water you would offer?  Christian? Patriot? Repubilcan?
Mitch McConnell , you're a shameful Hypocrite! 
#ProtectOurCare #KillTheBill #SaveACA #GOPSucks #StopTrumpCare
Whatever it takes to undo whatever legislation was passed by our nation's first black president, right? Let's just call this all what it is.
No one wants this...but by all means, keep wasting our time.  It only makes us more eager to end your career.
Your party controls the WH, the House, and the Senate, and you couldn't get this done? SAD! #ResignMcConnell
Is there a rule that says we can only have one system?  I'm ready for win/win thinking.  Congress is supposed to be LEADERS..
Just stop froggie
Typical RepubliKlan Taliban move can't pass a terrible health care bill so repeal a bill because it reminds you how great Obama was
PERFECT
Confused once said, go to bed with smile on face wake up with frown in Hell where you belong. Fake Christian, fake human being. 
PRICELESS
Repealitnow

Opinion: Trump and Republicans treat their voters like morons http://wapo.st/2uCTNz0 
Dear Mitch and your minions: why do you hate us so much? Signed, America
What are you afraid of? Did you take Russian help also?
"... Statement on Upcoming Vote to Impeach President Trump" ... fixed your typo.
You will kill people, primarily the people who voted for @realDonaldTrump and who can't afford health care without the ACA. Well done, sir!
U failed #WeThePeople re: #OBAMAcare  #RepealAndReplace
Am hopeful now.  We'll see what happens.
Would like to see Medicare trashed soon.
You are a failure.
We want #SinglePayer
So the bill to repeal a failure was a failure?
Congratulations on becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The people who changed #ACA the most but can't pass a replacement will be replaced.
You are bad at governing and bad at representing the interests of your constituents and the needs of our nation. Please retire.

Give us the House OK, give us the Senate Ok, give us the White House and we can get things done OK. When are you going to DO YOUR JOB?

Move Quickly @McConnellPress - American Working Caste won't Tolerate Failure. Get the 2015 Health Care Bill up for Vote. CC'd @julieblue917
Why is literally everything that comes out of your mouth a lie or unabashed hippocrasy, Cecil the turtle?
Get out of senate and go back to harassing Bugs Bunny, Cecil.
Geez… give it up! What part of "no" don't you understand?
Repeal & Replace that Chin & that Chao Chao
Live footage of reptilian @SenateMajLdr:
2009: We'll undo it if we win the House
2013: ...if we win the Senate
2015: ...if we win the POTUS
Liars. Cruz was right.
You couldn't do it in 7 years with 3 tries. What makes you think in 2 years you will find the solution? You'll be in prison soon enough, 
Have you seen the polls? Have you met w/your constituents that make less than $40k/year? You are tone deaf to what's happening. Shame.

what an uncaring piece of work you are!
I WILL NOT FORGET WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO AMERICANS>
#termlimitsforgeezers
What happened in your life to make you such a vile, hateful man? Your greed/ need for power override doing what is best for America.
From my understanding of your HC system & flaws and from our previous discussions, I really think you guys need to start from scratch!
In other words, we are stripping health care because we can't do anything else.
Not happy with replacement. Need to listen to Rand Paul. BTW what happened to national competition among insurers and tort reform??
http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59519811e4b0f078efd98440/amp?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 …
What possible good comes from doing this? How does that benefit Americans? It doesn't work for anyone
#ObamaStillRunninIt #ALLTheGOPCanSuckIt
Isis aren't the only thugs using human shields to extort concessions.
"Leader" McConnell? You wouldn't even know how to spell it more less what is required of one. Ass Clown through and through.
#RepealDeezNuts


constituants the better and more superior you feel. We dealt with your sort in our continents 75 years ago. We KNOW ALL ABOUT IT ANS WATCH
If Republicans want to keep their voters, they better keep their promises  !
Sir, we don't want statements, empty words. Words, no evidence, no results is rhetoric-BS. The ppl demand results NOW! No pork. We r 
And we'll make sure you fail there, too.
Registered Republican Voter here: if U don't currently have a plan U can pass don't repeal. You will end up with a lesser plan & voted out
This man is like the @michaelgove of our uk .. a bit thick, massive failure and does what the people that give money tell him..

Gotta love a party that says vote for us to repeal Obamacare, but if we repeal Obamacare people won't vote for us. 
#scam
If only it was "I took a shit on the American people and I resign"
Your overwhelming racism is showing and your ultimate hatred for Obama is clear. More about erasing his legacy then helping America! GIVE UP
You can pickup the body parts, Mitch.

#TrumpCare 4.0 is Dead.
@LisaMurkowski
@SenatorCollins
@SenCapito .. Bravo!
My statement on an upcoming vote to repeal #Obamacare 
Didn't your twitname used to be "Mitch McConnell"? "Leader" McConnell is insecure; the man who must proclaim "I am king!" is never the king.
PATHETIC. That's my statement as to your statement and your efforts. #Pathetic #GOP #norepeal
Give it up, dude. It's a loser.
I guess it's much easier to say "NO" to Pres. Obama for 8 years than it is to govern on your own. You had 7 years to develop an alternative.
I know u r trying. I will add you to my prayer list! Stay strong!
The CBO was even more brutal on repeal only. Let's see you weasel out of this one
CBO/JCT on REPEAL bill without REPLACE:
+32M uninsured
+*100%* premiums 
Tough break, Yertle.
You are an embarrassment.  You have failed as a Leader.  TIME FOR YOU TO STEP DOWN!!
You are sick.
Vile man. Murderer by any other name.
The GOP has had 8 years to come up with something. They had nothing. Now they want to repeal but not for 2 years? Why do we believe them?
You are truly trying to weaken the GOP aren't you? You must be secretly paid by the Dems to make mid-terms easier to win. If so, Thank you
@SenateMajLdr It is pretty sad that you are adamant about doing something that will hurt 80% of Kentuckians.
GOP had 7 years to get their act together and still can’t what’s 2 more years 
Going to do!
Just repeal ACA now u lazy bums, grandfather Medicaid, medicare now at 62 one plan with one w/o pre existing. Get bids from Ins. Co.
Repeal or Resign @SenateMajLdr you've been a spineless leader for years and you bet your ass I'm voting against you in the primaries.
So what do the 18 mill who will lose coverage over that span do? 
You want millions to possibly die so you can blame a black guy? 
Come on.
So easy, just work together or you republicans have another trick up your sleeve
Snake oil salesman! Wish we weren't paying for YOUR healthcare and salary. U R dead weight, pork...etc.

You're the absolute worst kind of person. Get over yourself & realize that the US doesn't want to repeal the ACA. FIX IT!
Hasn't this already failed? Why not try and fix the issues, and quit trying to give billionaires more money?
Repeal ALL  taxes and penalties. Provide govt. funding for high risk and pre-exist. How difficult can that be? Really!
What the frick took you so long
You are a cruel man!
Mitch, I can help out if needed. Just give me a call.
But Dear Leader, you promised you would Repeal and Replace. Did you lie? Are you not as clever as you think? Just retire for the good of USA
Liberals are the lying 
U r a disaster. Do the country a favor n step down n allow a real leader to take over.
Offer Congress healthcare like McCaskell's idea or go universal!
Are you forgetting that you represent actual people?
You need to go! Shameful what you are doing to millions of Americans like me whose Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment is covered by ACA. SHAME
#ImpeachMcConnell
Have you any shame, morality or decency whatsoever? No. #Trumpcare
REPEAL REPUBLICANS
You're everything wrong with this country, it's leadership and politics in general. Such petty small time thinking you possess. Grow up #sad
My statement,  HC is not about deal w/insurance to line your pockets.  It's about US, (cont) http://tl.gd/nnv0vs 

Right 
Why don't you do a favor to America and Reading!!! You failed!!!
Your hatred for Obama is pathological. Stop it - take a breath, and do something that make sense. Ripping hc from millions is murder.

This bill has passed the test of ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT.  What's your problem?
@realDonaldTrump it's time to start threatening a primary against @SenatorCollins , rally the troops around a repeal and piece meal replace.
Stop worrying about the press and just do something...anything!
your repeal effort was just about as successful as making the Great Barack Obama a one term president. face it you lost big time
Let us know when you decide to FIX what is broke instead of just writing your own crap 
Shame-fracking-ful. Calling on Kentuckians. You guys know what to do.
You had 7 years to come up with a plan. Why do you think you can come up with one in 2 more years? Hopefully you'll be voted out of office.

@SenateGOP M. McConnell is showing utter disdain for America! Time to show some spine and vote against this abominable bill.
You constantly and consistently attempt to take away health care from the country's most vulnerable.
You want to repeal without putting anything else in place? 7 years... you had 7 years to come up with a new plan. What have you been doing?
The only thing that needs to be repealed around here is your tenure as Majority Leader. We are over your party before country mentality.
You would simply be holding Americans hostage till 2019, then you'll force a desperate, bad, last-minute bill down their throats. Be honest
We voted in a @gop majority to get rid of this piece of garbage and replace it with a free market solution.  Get to work and get it done!
It's a good law, Brent.

Do I get your endorsement to mount my challenge in Kentucky? #RepealAndReplaceMitchMcConnell
Your God will be so proud of how you care for your fellow man
Cowards- so it kicks in after mid-terms? We need relief now premiums in @BCBSIL going to $30,000.00 in Fen 2018
How desperate can you be? Get over it. You're all talk and no plan.
Dead turtle alert!  Comrade.  You'll look so good in an orange neon jumpsuit.  You've pissed everybody off, and burnt all your bridges.
You realize you don't have to tow Trump's line. The lying is ridiculous. We see you and your party for what you are. Happy 2018!
I think your statement misplaced the word "failure." It belongs next to "repeal," not "Obamacare."
Instead of trying to derail it from the start, if the GOP gave the ACA the support it deserves, it would be a bigger success than it is now.

@SenateGOP I have never seen such a bunch of Worthless & Incompetent politicians in my life!! All talk no action!!
"PATHETIC"
@POTUS @GOP
When is McConnell's next baseball game?

So...you're just going to take away people's healthcare with NO plan to provide anything in it's place? knock 23M ppl off HC and then what?
You, sir, are an ass. America wants you to stop.
In this case "baby w/the bath water" means "we should win by killing even more people than the crappy bill we wrote would've killed".
Hey, dummy, you have car & house ins. Would you drop your policy without a replacement? Didn't think so.
@SenateGOP the McConnell plan, per the CBO, by 2026 
—increase the number of inusured people by 32 million, &
—double premiums.
