President Obama got about 4 confirmations to every 1 of President Trump’s during their first six months. http://bit.ly/2uCb0Zw  
Senator. What about the right of a president to nominate a SCOTUS justice?
Hatch, you are a liar just like every single Republican... not to mention you are a danger to those countries that try to discipline pharma.
When has this current president ever shown he is competent?
Can you post confirmations as a % of nominations? Also, % of time each spent golfing, at resorts or trying to take away taxpayers healthcare
Two words: Merrick Garland.
This is very misleading, but like Cantor confirmed, you all do this own purpose. It will be your downfall.
Please don't cherry pick the truth. We're not as stupid as Trump voters.
Get a real job

Shame on you.  For a "religious" man, you certainly lie and twist facts a lot.
Obama Obama Obama.  You miss him don't you?  Cuz he's not POTUS but @GOP keeps calling out his name. LOL
That is #fakenews from @SenateRPC. A distorted truth is a lie.
@RedAnneBolynn PBO chose qualified ppl. This guy: dismantling our country, stripping assets, wolves/hen house #MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland
Two words, Senator Hatch: Merrick Garland.  

Now tell me who the obstructionists are?
If y'all don't start PROTECTING America ... we'll know you're complicit.
You are 83 yrs and apparently want your legacy to be that of a liar supporting a traitor.
Please, give this argument a rest, you are now making a fool of yourself.
@RedAnneBolynn don't come out here acting a fool cuz u may be in line for the office since so much corruption above u.
Tell 'em Flo! His tweet, while trying to show what great playmates GOP were really showcased their stupidity!
Obama never lost confidence of people by being embroiled in Russian investigation and by breaking Emoluments act. Obama wasn't a criminal.
Who would want to work for Trump? The Mooch just got fired after 11 days on the job. Did it ever occur to you that nobody wants the job?
Percentage of nominees confirmed will paint a different picture.
3 out of 4 Trump nominations were dingbats. Obama put in the effort to actually nominate people for positions. Trump's too busy golfing.
Merrick Garland
Just stop talking. You've used your allotment of words for 20 lifetimes. Most of them have been stupid. Like this tweet. #retire
you have the whole government! Nobody is buying this.
Don't EVEN go there, Hatch.
Er... Garland?
You do enough lying for you and the numbers combined
How many did each president nominate? Why is that stat ignored? Do you remember Merrick Garland? We won't forget republican obstruction.
Blow me, Hatch. You obstructed Obama at every turn, voted to end my health care.
How nominees get confirmed when he has failed to actually nominate people? This whole administration is a clusterf*ck. And so is the GOP.
Democrats had the Senate then, as Republicans do now. The only lesson is that you folks are seriously incompetent.
Something is wrong here. #doublestandard we need to get people confirmed!
But why was there no plan ready from the GOP after so many years of campaigning against Obamacare? Call out McCain.
Obama nominated fully qualified people, who completed their paperwork appropriately.

Finally, I agree with you! @BarackObama was a more productive president despite republicans obstruction.
President Obama nominated people who were actually fit for the position...
You'd think by the time someone reached your age, they'd say "I'm tired of dissembling. From here on out, I'm just going to tell the truth."
Merrick Garland
You're a huge liar and Trump apologist.
All look at all the incompetent people you have approved for cabinet picks!   we the people will hold the @GOP responsible.
If only Democrats had nominated more people like Merrick Garland this all could have been avoided.
Sadly, you are.
Lies, damn lies, & statistics. You need to compare not # confirmed, but # confirmed vs # submitted. <bugs bunny what a bunch of maroons gif>
The numbers don't but you and everyone in your office does #MerrickGarland #BillLee
In your wildest, wettest dreams, Trump will NEVER measure up to Obama. #lunaticGOP #everythingisacompetitiontoGOP
Your party stole a SC vacancy. Have a seat.
please put up some people who are quailfied already...gosh
http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/06/trump-administration-nominees-paperwork-239124 … Hatch Staff: you have the majority. It's not the @SenateDems fault POTUS's staff can't manage the simplest tasks.
Wow stepped in hornet's nest there...PS unblock me on the public forum that is your official Facebook page. #1stAmendment #RestoreMyRights
Republicans forfeited the right to complain about obstruction when they blocked Obama's SCOTUS nominee for an entire year.
A nominee that republicans specifically requested.
Then threatened to do the same for the entirety of HRC's admin, if she was elected.
#FAKENEWS  You're a filthy liar.
Send your whines to Garland.
You have to nominate someone before you can confirm them. This is basic high school civics stuff. Although, I'm sure nobody wants the gig.
Also you have to nominate qualified candidates? Ummm just thinking out loud

How many people have been nominated by Trump that have been "obstructed"?
The GOP has control and the nominees are not qualified or they would be approved. #FakePresident #TreasonousTrump #25thAmendment
Another thing you might note is the small number of people actually put up for nomination.
You blocked Garland for a year for no reason other than that he was not appointed by your person. How is that not obstruction?
You have all 3 branches of gov't & control the agenda. The failure is your own & @realDonaldTrump . Time for another vacation?
Oh Orrin, you are lying right now.  Seriously?
Trump still hasn't nominated half as many people for positions as POTUS 44.  Also if *45 nominates liars, crooks and thieves, just saying.
You are in the majority. Get something done!
Uh huh.
You're right, numbers don't lie. And the numbers of candidates who have been nominated are exceedingly low, and that's all POTUS.
35 years ago,when you started leeching off taxpayer teats,before the internet archived everything said & done,people probably believed you
We witnessed it. You're guilty as sin, & shameless w/ your attempts 2 cover it up. Keep shilling 4 treasonous @POTUS we will remember.
Oral Snatch really knows how to lie. Give him a medal.
FFS does anyone on your side of the aisle tell the truth? Does Merrick Garland ring a bell?  You obstructed PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR 8 years!
You can make numbers lie though. May have to do with the fact that President Obama did WORK while he was in office.
Also..it would help if Tumpy  wasn't wanting all Russian involved hoodlums in office..Just my opinion.
The question is why should any Sen. be rushing to confirm the nominees of a President who is under investigation for conspiring with Russia?
Well Rupublicans lie. Especially President Swamp Thing and YOU.
From the Politico article "How Trump is stalling is own nominees," June 7th 2017
Notice that in the first 100 days, Obama sent three times as many nominees to be confirmed by the Senate.
Trump's failure to nominate is by design - Bannon wants a "deconstruction of government" - i.e. fewer govt employees
Also, many Trump appointees (Cohn, Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross, DeVos) are hedge funders and billionaires.  The exact opposite of what he promised.
"You may hear "but Republicans obstructed President Obama." -- Yes. We're accustomed to hearing truth, just not from you or GOP. Hypocrite.
tell it to the Judge (Garland)
It is time to stop pitting Reps against Dems, and be for AMERICA. We all know that they is a huge chance that you will be president  soon.
MERRICK. GARLAND. Also, 45 keeps nominating the worst, least qualified swamp monsters he can find. You WANT them confirmed? Appalling.
How bogus. 45 has to actually nominate people for the positions. Not Dems fault he doesn't go his job.
Truth is Trump has lagged in submission of nominees. & you forgot to mention you stole a Scotus nomination from President Obama.
Orrin you may want to actually present some real facts. This is bs. How many noms has Trump presented? How many were actually qualified?
But the one we will NEVER forget is Merrick Garland.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I would like to see you compare the number of nominations made!
Stop posturing and go nuclear, then.
Can you explain why @realDonaldTrump nominates some1 against EPA to run EPA, some1 who knows nothing abt public education 2b sec. of educ.?
Jees, don't remember Obama appointing an animal husbandry major to be Energy Sec., or some old racist coot to be AG. The lunacy don't lie.
Post another chart that shows how long it takes Trump to submit the paper work after he nominates so the person can be considered.
Yes numbers don't lie. GOP and team trump lie everyday.
Who cares. Both parties should come to an agreement to show @POTUS how a democracy actually works. This oligarchy needs to end.
We want you get rid of the filibuster! Go to 51 vote nuclear option Stop acting like we don't know what is going on here YOU are obstructing
Please tweet the complete picture including
# nominated
# that have complete paperwork filed and cleared
# approved
Get the facts out there
WE LIVED IT! You can't gaslight us. Sorry.
May we get off of the anti-Obama kick? We have a new president now, and despite what a moron he is, we have to press ahead with him.
Guess you guys shouldn't have ignored Merrick Garland.  Don't poison the well and then b*tch about the water's taste.
So you need to stop lying
They did obstruct him Turkey neck mc'connell even said he was proud that he was doing it
They STILL obstructed him every way they could. And stole a Supreme Court Justice. So there's that.
Have you noticed the kind of people who are getting positions.  The Democrats seem to be looking out for their constituents.  YOU should too
Trump's appointments are some of the worst in history.  Old Orrin needs to grow a backbone.
Did they also fill out the correct info for background checks?
And how many nominations has he actually submitted? From what I understand, he's been golfing more than working.

Of the 283 noms to agencies, the Senate has only been able to confirm 56. By this time they'd confirmed 69% of President Obama's nominees.
Perhaps if Elder Hatch did not just confirm appointments because they were made by a Republican, we would not have the mess that we do.
Do you ever tire of claiming someone else is the problem, while claiming how much power you have in DC?
If Don would stop golfing and put forward more nominations, more would be confirmed. It'd also help if nominees were actually qualified.
let's also remember that other than titles there is nothing presidentially comparable #Obama=consciousness 
#Trump=chaos
@SenateRPC He nominated qualified individuals that had their paperwork together.Stop with the divisiveness,get some work done
So ignore the Democrats and discard policies like the blue slips. You have the power, just do it.
Will @senorrinhatch ever stop lying....??!!! Seems like he takes after his Dear Leader!

But you are lying right now.  Post the number for both admin's number of nominations and tell the truth about "obstruction."
Continue down this disingenuous path, Sen Hatch, and you will be ruining your credibility to lead a nation.
Too late. He did that the day he said Diaper Don's russian spy meeting "isn't relevant."
@SenateRPC We more than heard it; we lived through eight years of obstruction! Suck it up Buttercup!
You need to be very careful with any Trump nomine. Trump has strong connections to the mafia and is only looking out for himself.
@SenateRPC 
Nominations need!!
Why push this easy to find lie?

I expected better from you sir!

Reagan took walls down!
Oh come on! Right out of the mouth Mitch Mconal "we'll obstruct at every chance"
Trump is to busy rage tweeting golfing ,watching  Fox News and capaigning to appoint people and you know it
Hey social media intern, this is a bad hill to die on. Let it go
Of course that might be because he appointed ppl worked,  persuaded and actually chose sane people instead of Golfed Tweeted and threatened
