You are playing with people's LIVES just because you have a personal beef with Obamacare. You are an embarrassment to our state!
I'm an in-home pediatric nurse. Nearly ALL Medicaid patients. If they lose services, we lose our jobs. If that happens I will invoice you
How many Utahans get to die because of your cruelty?
I work at Primary Children's Hospital as a nurse and know for fact lifetime caps will devastate families with disabled children.
Please do not support lifetime or yearly caps in any health plan.  They are harmful to many people.
You mean, the mega rich, right? Let's get this right!
Retire old man! 
You got a lot of unhappy replies and very few likes or retweets on this in 8 hrs. That should speak volumes Senator Hatch #whathappenedtoyou
Read the bill, politician.
I truly doubt you met with any of the people you listed. You were in Washington, Remember?
Only for Utah's 1%.
The only devastation is to the 1% pockets, you know those masters of yours.. You and the @GOP serve them, let us not kid ourselves
No it doesn't. Stop it!You are supposed to be representing&advocating 4 the people of Utah.We need ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS
Yes we do.
A. Using "#RepealObamacare" makes you seem pretty partisanly self-interested
B. How can you say this proposal helps Utahns when it will actually limit coverage for mental health and substance abuse treatment?
C. I appreciate that you've had "countless meetings" but maybe in the future you could count them and track them so we actually believe you
Are u aware @SenMikeLee released a video recently stating he was frustrated as a committee member that he had no idea what was in the bill?
Vote him out!

What does $450000 plus buy, Senator Orin Hatch, selling lies to his voters.  Love your lobbyists more don't ya Orin
Here is a list of contributions by insurance and pharma to the 13 Men writing bill.
I don't call optional Maternity care a win. Pregnant women and Fathers won't call it a win.
Sen. Hatch please so not allow waivers of essential health benefits such as maternity care to be part of a health care plan.
Do you honestly believe the words coming out of your mouth?
He needs someone to whisper in his ear what to say. Ridiculous a guy who may be prez when the rest go down can't think for himself.
I'm curious how a tax break that will leave 22 million more people uninsured is going to be beneficial.
The number of citizens wh will suffer and die from trumpcare is more than all the terrorist combined this this murder by trump and the GOP
Stop lying like your president. This is the internet age and we all know you are talking bullshit.

So very shameful and you are old enough to know better. How's your conscience? Russian sell out.
It will result in the deaths of thousands of Americans you sadistic, out of touch dick.
Except we poor and Ill who depend on Medicaid.
I don't call optional cancer coverage, or caps, a win. Cancer patients won't call it a win.
Sen Hatch, that will be financially devastating for many and tragic for those who can't afford cancer coverage. This is not compassionate.
It provides for tax cuts for the rich. #nohearingnovote
Critical wins for the rich.
#wealthcare is criminal - #AHCA is going to kill #Utahns around the state.  Literally blood on your hands. #comehome
#delusional there is nothing of value in this bill. #simulacra of governance.  Please vote against it.
R u nuts? #GOPHealthcareBill is a travesty.Its a death sentence 4 poor/disadvantaged and a billion $ tax cut for top 1%. #Wealthcare
If your wins hurt the most vulnerable Americans, it's never a win. You should be ashamed.
This bill is the antithesis of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Do unto others, Senator.
I have cried over your votes @senorrinhatch I thought you were a man of God. You are THAT wolf in sheeps clothing. These are perilous times

Liar.
BULLSHIT
I'd love to hear you explain how RETROACTIVE tax cuts for rich investors or viciously slashing Medicaid lowers my premiums.
FIFY: The Senate healthcare bill contains a number of critical wins for *RICH people of Utah!
Your plan puts my son off all insurance as he will be capped out at 19! This is not a unacceptable! #tryagain #advocateforarthritis
Thi s is a murder bill
You constantly remind constituents that you are a member of the LDS church. If this is an example of their values, it is NIT Christian.
He doesn't have to represent LDS values. He was voted to represent the people, not the Church.
You liar. Just each and every one of you old men who wrote this in secret, a liar.
Seriously! You say this is a win? Try this is the worst thing you could do for us! I can't wait to not vote for you!
Including an increase in the supply of virgin blood for elderly Senators. Get it. Because you're a vampire.
Liar.
Help Sabrina with TBI #SabrinaStrong
LIAR. You want to kill poor people and give the money that would save lives to the rich. You may think you're a saint but that is evil.
Why didn't you recommend a single payer plan? Going back to pre-ACA is not acceptable. Republican death panel is what you have laid out.
This bill is inhumane, cruel and damages everyone, except those getting a tax cut. How do you sleep at night? You are destroying families.
Hatch is bought and paid for by pharma lobby received $471,560 last year. Hatch works for pharma industry not Utah's people. #hypocrite
You're a liar and a cheat. On the bright side, passing this bill will ensure you and many other Rs will be losing their seats next year.
No. It contains wins for you and your ego. 
Those of us who are of modest income, middle age, and imperfect medical records are ... screwed.
Conveniently, you're referencing a bill with not named #AHCA and not providing a link to the bill you're referencing.
If you click the link you'll see that this bill is not the AHCA. And there's a link to the bill text on the page.
Correct. He isn't talking about the AHCA.
Incorrect: there's a link to the bill he is referencing in the article.
It's hyperlinked near the bottom.
Which are far outweighed by all the crucial losses. Tell your constituents the truth, Senator. You're selling them out.
Tell us how awesome it is for children and adults with disabilities.
Perhaps for wealthy people. But this bill would be devastating for my family.  My husband has epilepsy.  We can't afford the #AHCA
Are you kidding me?! Please retire. Utahns can't take your "wins" anymore. #hypocrite #CountryOverParty #utpol
How well does this cover dementia in senior senators that have forgotten the challenges Americans actually face on a daily basis??
Since I can't reply to my other thread:

D. How, specifically, is this bill a win for sick, poor, disabled, and/or elderly Utahns?
E. Keeping coverage for pre-existing conditions doesn't count as a win. We shouldn't be expected to thank you for not taking something away.
I don't call a Senator who treats the vulnerable like collateral damage a winner.  Orrin Hatch used to call useless senators home.
I don't call millions more in tax cuts for the wealthy a win. Christ didn't call it a win Matt 19:24
For the rich people of Utah. Tool.
What in the hell is wrong with you.  #disgusting #disappointed
Win for Utah? You have health insurance. You are not Christ like. Disturbing example of a Mormon.
I don't call making people reapply for benefits every month a win. Seniors, children, ESL speakers, won't call it a win.
Hatch tops the list with $ 475000 in his pocket!!!
I don't call treating the defenseless like refuse a win. Christ didn't call it a win. Matt 25:40
Only a mortician would consider throwing potentially 205k Utahans off insurance & Medicaid for tax cuts for the 1% a win.  #MerchantOfDeath
People of Utah check and see the Senators who have taken money from Insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies!!
I don't call closed door legislation a win. Founding Fathers wouldn't call it a win.
You are NOT working on behalf of the citizens of Utah!  You are for the insurance and pharmaceutical companies!  Hatch given 475,000 $
I don't call lack of substance abuse coverage a win. People addicted to painkillers after accidents won't call it a win.
I don't call Medicaid reductions a win. Seniors and critically ill people won't call it a win.
Are you delusional?
Please tell me how this bill improves coverage or reduces premiums for the sick and elderly. I don't think it does. Vote NO. #utpol
I don't call per capita caps a win. Children with disabilities won't call it a win.
@AARP The insurance companies and very wealthy win, not the people.
I don't think their listening. Retire. You are too old to be in touch with the people.
Why do you hate America and her people so much?
I need to see your highlighted copy of where women/poor/old come out better because all I can see is insurance companies benefiting.
You are evil. You know damn well what this bill does to this nation's most vulnerable. You are sick.
All the beautiful salt in the comments!
"@kylegriffin1 "AARP will also hold all 100 Senators accountable for their votes on this harmful health care bill."
How do retroactive tax cuts for the 1% benefit Utah?
Time to retire you old fool. And a traitor to your country
How can you be "pro-life"&anti-healthcare for all?What about maternity coverage for those babies you are so concerned about?
traitor!!!!!! that is BS!
