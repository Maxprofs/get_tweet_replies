Right on man. Whether or not people like him politically, he's still a fellow human being.
He has way more strength & heart than that fool in the White House McCain didnt dodged the draft. He sacrificed for his soldiers and country
Yeah I really didn't like when Trump mocked him for being a PoW. Extremely disrespectful and insensitive. Most wouldn't last 5mins as a POW.
Glad you said that. And Trump put down Veterans with PTSD. I have it and see alot Vietnam Vets at work that have it. Mr McCain get well soon
Prayers to your entire family. Your father is the poster child of faith, strength and courage.
