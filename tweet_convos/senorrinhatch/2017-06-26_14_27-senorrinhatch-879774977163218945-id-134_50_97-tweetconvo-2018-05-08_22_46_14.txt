WTF #GOP thinks Americans are stupid. An endorsement by Anthem makes their #Trumpcare #KillMedicaidBill good? They're in on this BULLSHIT!
Anthem makes more $$$ under #TrumpCare. That's what it's all about @TheView @WSJ  @HuffPost @AislingMcDL
OMG LIARS! If they endorse it then they are profiting from it. Isn't that what you said ACA DID!! Get a clue, we have!  2018 KARMA'S COMING
Is the “stability fund” what Rubio forced out of the ACA plan?

Majorities across parties say GOP/President Trump are responsible for any #ACA problems going forward

LOL DUH!!!! I'd agree to it too if I got billions in tax breaks.
I bet they would! It makes a lot of money for them and hurts people! They don't care about us, just our dollars! VOTE NO!
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @SenateGOP FAILED us!! 
Of course they do....This bill is a win-win for them.  More profits and bigger CEO AND Administrative salaries....and Control over all of us
Republicans are in collusion with ins co CEOS to cut Medicaid and charge AMERICANS more for ins AND kick 22 mil off healthcare. COLLUSION!!!
Thats because they were the lobbyists in the room writing this thing while the rest of the senate didnt see it
WHY DO I CARE ABOUT ANTHEM I care about PEOPLE
Of course they would because they will make billions
No shit sherlock, all they care about is money not HC.
Well that should tell you all you need to know. Health insurance companies for it. Doctors against it..
The Anthem that used a computer program to identify women with breast cancer and cancel their policies? Congratulations GOP! #Bettercare
It's not better care, it's worse care and 22 million people will either lose their insurance or die because of you! #liarliar
#repealdontreplace 
#Freemarkethealthcare
#FullRepealACA
How about this idea? Get the government OUT of health care! Repeal O-care. Full stop!
That's because Anthem is an evil soulless company.
Anthem shame on you!  You are just saying this because you get a hand out, and the people get garbage!  Threatening to leave b/c of O'care.
both American citizens & those voting for it. They will be voted out.Russian Ayn Rand philosophy doesn't belong-Congress
The Senate Bill is is the most immoral disgraceful piece of legislation by GOP & will have serious consequences for
It figures. Anthem doesn't like sick ppl.They denied me coverage for HEADACHES! My meds were too expensive. @AnthemInc
I am begging you not to turn your back on the poor, diabled, and aging. Don't lose your humanity for political gain...
I bet their CEO gets a juicy tax break out of the deal.
Of Course , $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$, they can get RICHER!!! Fuckn morons
Good.  I think that seals the deal.  The bill will surely pass now.
I'm not interested in what the greedy monsters @AnthemInc get out of your bill. I'm concerned with the 22 million who won't have insurance.
Of course they do!  It makes them richer!  Their goal is profit not saving lives!  You all are frighteningly dull witted!
And how much did Anthem give to the Senators?
Like Anthem gives a shit about anything but money
How do you people sleep at night? #CROOKS
Sure, they get more money for less coverage
Shame on all of you.
Full repeal. Price transparency. Apply Rico and antitrust laws to insurance companies. That would drive down cost dramatically
DOA
BFD, of course they would. #MedicaidKillBill ONLY benefits wealthy, healthy & Insurance companies #Trumpcare will kill thousands of people
other health plans have slammed the legislation as harmful, and outside experts have warned it could destabilize the individual marketplace.
The true test is whether members of congress are going to give up their healthcare coverage and sign up for what everybody else will have 
Why - when 22 million ppl lose HC coverage? Oh I forgot more profit 4 Anthem & @GOP - get larger campaign donations -blood $ earned by both
That's because they'll be able to charge ppl more and have to cover fewer things
Well Duh, it improves their bottom line.  They paid you for it.
The American Medical Association (AMA) just released a statement declaring its opposition. I think I will believe my doctors
Of course they do. They won't be saddled with lots of sick people who might actually cost them money. #duh #Trumpcare #kills
Actually takes 800million away from Medicaid Pays for tax cut for top 1% earners
Thx! That's my provider.
Outsmart ACA by adopting the Taiwan healthcare model, providing healthcare coverage to ALL Americans at just 6% of GDP(unlike now at 17%)???
Sure, they paid into the re-election campaigns for McConnell and team to work this for them!
4 million lose employer sponsored plans dropped in 2018. 15 m total lose coverage in 2018! Midterms much?
Here's how you know this is bad for actual people.
RepubliCON Death Panals and Sarah Palin is silent! Sad.
Of course. They don't have to cover as much any more! I'm not sure I'd actually promote this "endorsement".
Which former Washington Republican is on Anthem's board of directors?
Oh, are THEY going to insure the 15MM that stand to lose coverage in 2018 if this travesty passes?
I am sure they do as they will only get more money for absolutely free. Also, they can kick out/charge up anybody they don't want to insure
Well if insurance company likes it it must be good, for them.
If you vote yes, we vote you out! You stop representing the American people for the greed of corporations and ceos
The Tax Subsidy, right? Come meet regular constituents, and those needing long term care, see if they agree.  The real test.
This is such crap!! #FullRepeal!!!!
@CobieSmulders @MarkRuffalo @JohnLeguizamo @SenSanders @NancyPelosi @FoxNews @HouseGOP  Get "ER" done.
Because they'll make a lot more money. Wealthcare for the insurance companies isn't gonna work! #GOPLies #NoTrumpCare
And that's exactly what it is Sally! It's 'WEALTHCARE FOR THE RICH"
So all Trump would have to do is provide certainty for payments to the insurance companies & they would endorse Obamacare......again
We don't need more insurance. We need a health CARE plan. Lobby $  drives you Trumpublicans, not what's good for the USA. SHAME!
Surprise! An Insurance Company posed to make billions supports a bill that gives them billions, that's why the donate millions
You don't say....is it because they make more money with this failed bill?
LOL of course they do! DUH.
I don't believe we the people endorse it.#fullrepeal #Nomoresocializedhealth
I'll be changing my provider
Is that supposed to be good?
is this the same Anthem that donated $1 million to trumps inaguration?  oh why, yes it is.
Of course they do! They stand to make tons of money! This is hardly a ringing endorsement - if anything it shows how bad this bill is.
You mean a company that makes millions off of sick people endorses this bill. Big whoop that's suppose to make me feel better.
Because they will make billions more
OF COURSE U DO & U WILL BE MAKING A TON OF BUCKS FROM IT!!YUK!!
.@SenateGOP .@SenateDems Of course Anthem approves.  They helped write it.  Anything to make a buck.  #IWantMyACA
Obama care is an abject failure. We must simply free markets, price transparency and then fund risk pools
#MEDICAIDFORALL or #SINGLEPAYER please.
The endorsement comes as doctors, hospitals, patient groups and even other health plans have slammed the legislation as harmful,
Of course, an insurer that lined your pockets to get their way endorses you.  #DUH
Promises? #Trumpcare #EpicFail
I bet they do
I know #Scalise is recuperating, but can we get a statement whether he thinks Americans should have access to the same Healthcare he did?
