No, YOU are failing the American people. Instead of repealing what is working, why not make it better? #Singlepayer
replace first protect pre-existing conditions
Why don't you leave it in place and make amendments. You will leave many people without insurance.
The Dems came up w/a plan, what has the GOP offered? Nothing! No replacement-just millions now w/o health ins.
you're failing the American public. This is pathetic. We NEED healthcare.
BS. Let's take away your coverage
you are liars and you are evil! This is wrong!
Evidence please. Some coverage outside of Fox News?
get a clue, ACA is essential for millions!!!
Absolute rubbish. Of course, you have your nice, free health care. What do you care about your constituents???
Individual Ins,unlike Group Ins. had no protections before ACA. Rampant denial of claims,coverage due to minor issues
This hurts self employed more than anyone.Before ACA, Ins.never paid claims,refused Ins.due to harmless spider bite!
@SenOrrinHatch @JohnCornyn I will not be voting for @JohnCornyn again and I am spreading the word.

YOU don't give a damn about the American ppl, as long as the 1% are happy. We should start a memorial list for the
You've had 4 yrs to fix ACA. You didn't want to because Wall St, insurance lobbyists & your donors didn't want it.
You can give huge tax cuts to the wealthy. Destroying people's lives so you can give tax cuts? Unconscionable!!

It's the @GOP who is failing America! Right now, TODAY! @realDonaldTrump is a TRAITOR
stop w lies. ACA has saved lives, & cont to do so. DJT likes the provisions & wants to keep them. #ACAReformNOTRepeal
OR - "The ACA is providing insurance to millions of people and relieving dependence on employer-provided HC."
"It's unclear how they'll replace it." - Fox News
I want the same insurance YOU have. That will be fine with me. OKAY thank problem solved, how easy was that.
universal healthcare is proven and it works for everyone, get a grip!
Not like not having Obama care will. Wait til those numbers come in.

tell that to the millions & millions of citizens that have enrolled for 2017.  They may have a different opinion.
.@SenateGOP @JohnCornyn it does not matter if you hate #ACA if you have nothing better to offer. #GOPWhatsYourPlan #Obamacare
only if you remove medical bill bankruptcy. and allow hospitals to refuse service without payment up front
It is only failing because Republicans are standing in the way of their Greed!
you're failing the American people
Excellent idea repeal it now please show the world you hypocrisy

You are all CRIMINALS who don't care about the HEALTH of our PEOPLE! Stop your LIES! We the PEOPLE know the TRUTH!
So stop bitching and whining about it and fix it. Make it better. Try helping the American people for a change.
Don't give a shit about Obamacare right now. Your own @SenJohnMcCain needs to get out of the party now.
there are problems w/ACA and most of them were caused by R's fighting it every step of the way.
It is not the ACA that has failed, but the entire GOP, from opposing healthcare access to placing Trump as president
then Medicare for all, eliminate the profit driven middleman  .
bullshit. What is your better plan?

That's an impossible amt and they don't care.  Anyone that's been turned down for ins is scared.
Oh, B.S.! Quit repeating this lie! You are doing this to try to justify privatizing Medicare and your other schemes!
me too, they have never been in our shoes. They don't care about us. We're dispensable.
you first
pls show us in which states? Why do't u stop ur fallacies and tell the truth that #red state r Hurting their citizens
please provide us with the plan that's better - we can't wait (the GOP has promised this for years!)
It's so bad for them that they keep signing up for it!?
lies! We will not listen to lies!
... We know it.  DEMOCRAT'S don't want to know it.
The Republican Rules Committee is still Public Enemy #1... !
@SenateDems
You are wrong.  Ask the PEOPLE
Not me.  #FixDontNix
