Congress is getting ready to do….nothing, Tell them you want #taxreform #FAIRtax #MTFA http://FAIRtax.org/petition  then call then 202-224-3121 
Why dont you guys fight for the #FAIRtax ? Broaden the tax base. Get the politics out. No lobbyists. No IRS. No filing. Pay at register.
Then they should do something about Trump administrators' spending on private flights.

Taxes really American citizens are dying in Puerto Rico get on that before more deaths on your hands
Nothing you do on tax reform is acceptable without Trump releasing his personal taxes
Get over it all ready
You may be convincing 35% of the American people - your base - but the rest of America knows this is just a massive tax cut for the wealthy
You are lying and you know it I'm considered the working poor under trumps tax cuts I get to keep more of my money please wake up
"Trickle down will work this time. Promise." #gopgov
You will be a has been & will NEVER b re-elected if you don't switch to a majority vote instead of 60, yesterday! #forwethepeeps #trumptrain

We're NOT helpless. Here are some measures most Americans support that could help stop future mass shootings. Pass it on. (h/t @sangerkatz) 
Sure will read anything from an intelligent member of congress gets my attention the White House plan is another elitist scam
still looks like this.....
#Kochtapus
Liar liar pants on fire! Repubs lie through their teeth, all the time!
McConnell can you read sign language? 
Your fullof shit McConnell! No one has said the middle class gets a tax cuts but your friends who don't need them get one! More McConnell BE
Is that the same Orrin Hatch with the $7 million net worth?
One washed up old senile fool supporting another washed up old senile fool.  We see the you.
I’d rather peel off my toenails than listen to Orin Hatch’s lies. No thanks. #Corrupt
Hatch is an old hack. A joke. Almost as useless as McConnell.
No tax reform without Trump's tax returns. Stop the deception
CEOs are compensated in the hundreds of millions of $$ to keep wages and benefits LOW. Cutting taxes  for the wealthy won't change that.

The same Orin Hatch that told people to shut up? Ok - just so I know who we are dealing with 
Let's see how much the POTUS will save on his taxes before we vote. No #TaxcutsForTheRich
All these 80 year old white guys who are lined up to eliminate the inheritance tax on estates over 3 million? Self Serving BS!!
lies from gop are old.
Please don’t speak Mitch. You enrage Republican who care about America
Don't Believe Him Either! Etch in STONE/SIGN in BLOOD that the bill will not benefit the wealthy, esp. #45 tax rate will go from 39% to 25%
As Chairman of @GOPSenFinance, @senorrinhatch's job, like @SenateMajLdr , is to lie to us about #TaxReform
our byzantine tax structure has been overseen by you and #hatch for years & years it is clear you are better at subterfuge than clarity

How much $ your wife's family planning on making off Maria
Did an aide whisper this op-ed in Orrin's ear?
I will lose deductions and my tax rate will increase 10%. What do I cut so Trump can have his tax credit? Food?
The Graham-Cassidy of tax reform-billions to the rich at the expense of workets who now have fewer rights. Poof! The middle class destroyed
Blah, blah Blah, we need to start seeing results in our favor from now on. We have to hold Congresspersons accountable from now on.
Yes we do! 2018! Everyone vote before the bogus voter fraud laws get passed
GOP Regan/Bush knew too. That's why wealth & corps sheltered dollars off shore .
99.8 % of estates owe no estate tax, per Joint Committee on Taxation only estates of the wealthiest 0.2 percent of owe any estate tax.
Read op pgs in NYT, "Tax, Lies and Video'
Name one GOP tax cut plan over the past 40 years that's worked for anyone other than the wealthy. One. I'll wait.
Alt Min Tax cost @realDonaldTrump $31 million in 2005 and
now he wants to eliminate it. I wonder why? #taxreform #NoGOPtaxreform
>$418K get 4.6% cut, >$91k get 3% cut, $37k-$91k NO CUT Explain to me again how the rich don't benefit? #taxreform #NoGOPTaxReform
Alternative facts, more alternative facts.
Don't waste our time with your nonsense.
Not going to let you pass a bill that takes food off the table of every day people so a guy named Trump can get  a kickback in a tax credit
Go home, Mitch... go home! Impeach Trump the Dotard!

NOT BUYING YOUR BULLSHIT ANYMORE

#Resist                 #TrumpTaxScam
Tax cuts to wealthy only everyone else are to bend over & let this happen that way the GOP can get the rich's donations for re-election
Turtles all the way down https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down … @MichaelBerrySho
How can you believe that Americans can't see through @GOP Sham for tax reform that benefits the wealthy and the Trump family personally.
So Corp get big breaks middle class give and take away donors everything am I missing something
Liar. Trickle down only works for wealthiest. You're duping the 33%ers. Resign take @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan with u. #taxplansucks
Puerto Rico is without water and food and you all are obsessed with getting bigger tax returns for Kochs.
The resultant demand spurs business growth, adds jobs,& feeds the treasury with increased tax revenue. Tax cuts are hoarded never reinvested
Unfortunately as he's associated with the corrupt GOP and the treasonous Administration his word and opinions are suspect.  Go away Mitch!
Bullshit sold here.  Loop holes for corporations remain while dropping their taxes drop from 35%-20%. 
The Republician way. Screw the people
American's are tired of the BULL SHIT Start with lowering taxes for the middle-class first. Trickled down economics doesn't work.
He's the reason no one will buy what you sell.
Have any of you idiots in congress taken a macroeconomics course? A vibrant middle class spurs growth via demand not tax cuts.

Send a link to the bill 
A unified front on a tainted platform. You guys have no heart for the American Ppl and it shows. The nose in the air attitude. You're better
Just like you all supposedly knew about healthcare reform?  bahahahaha  #Turtlecantgovern
Bullshit. Tax cuts to rich and corporations never trickle down. We need to rev the economic engine of the country- namely the MIDDLE CLASS.
Instead of cutting taxes for rich & hoping it trickles down, cut consumers taxes so money percolates up to the companies that can compete
Puerto Rico - your family has ships, TRUMP has planes, you are even worse than Bush did after Katrina. Stopping help thats offered.
Being chairman makes him knowledgeable? Orrin only knows that a lower tax rate for his wealthy donors is the desired outcome.
Show some leadership and get this tax reform passed
Why do you want it?
Bull-It’s payback time 4 ur donors. Corp taxes are historically low. We need investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, energy.
After all of the lies you tried to sell about repeal & replace do you really think the majority of Americans will believe your tax cut plan?
Orrin hatch the Orrin Hatch who spit on his brothers grave he knows how to be a coward that is all
You MUST look at @TomFitton &. @JudicialWatch page. WHY ARE YOU LETTING DOJ/FBI GET AWAY WITH THIS?
JW fights for #Clinton draft indictment  and calls for #IRS Commish to be removed & #Mueller investigation to end.
http://jwatch.us/xz8iZn 
Cant be #ProLife and pro-TRUMP .  Russian troll or insane, right?
You ever think that Trump and everything you're going through is payback for what you did to O? Not sure if you think that deep. Oh well!
Retire already.
It is a shame to have to explain to my kids why we have criminals in our government,  & nobody does anything about it.
Would've been much worse if @HillaryClinton  won. She is a Felon over and over.
OK, LOWER THE TAX RATE FOR THE RICH AND CORPS TO 25% BUT CUT OUT ALL TAX DEDUCTIONS OR INCENTIVES FOR THEM ALSO. U SEE, I KNOW THAT U WON'T!
Here is another senator who has been in the office way too long repeal and replace McConnell and hatch
Your fired
He knows about #TaxReform? Then why is he only reforming taxes for the top 1%?
One doesn't impeach without an actual crime. So I am assuming you have one?
Bot?
Me? lol No. I am quite real. I also asked a simple question. Impeach him on what actual grounds. You have to have a proven crime.
Look up the Emolument clause as a start.
Clauses of Impeachment have been up in the House for Months
I have. It's never been invoked and most scholars reject this as a basis. And yes....clauses by some far righters for Obama were as well.
We've never had the corrupt profiteer at the top spot.
You don't know much about American history. lol But hey...if you wish to believe this will be invoked successfully go right ahead. ;)
