@OrrinHatch @sltrib Silence a smart woman + squash free speech + approve unqualified major Senate donor. Great day's work!
Orrin Hatch would not allow the respected Elizabeth Warren to speak REGARDNG HIS RACIST FRIEND ON THE FLOOR TODAY
Hatch: a small door or opening. An asshatch open for anti-Mormon, anti-Christ Drumpfs to bumfuck.
@OrrinHatch Why don't you meet with Trump on the H1-b plan? He has the right idea. You sure don't!!
@OrrinHatch there should be no vote on Gorsuch until the FBI investigation is over. Stop colluding with illegitimate president.
@OrrinHatch taxpayers pay expenses of Senate, right now, all those DemocRATS should be arrested for theft of tax dollars.

@OrrinHatch @sltrib Vote No on Devos- your silence speaks million words
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch  Merrick Garland

Democrats are only adapting to the Senate fractured by McConnell's leadership.  Why the outrage?
@OrrinHatch @sltrib coward.
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch disgusting Empty suit. Just my opinion. 8 years of nothing and bucking under trump for you
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch and Garland was a good pick for both partiesSuch a liar.And if. Liston son seat never filmed
Trump 'Pastor' Jeffress "Mormonism is an abomination from the pit of hell" while Hatch blows Donny.
Better make sure President Bannon approves.
"I don't care what they want at this point," Hatch said. Go nuclear - I dare you.
I say Evan McMullin is the way - NO HATCH.
U have NO fricken Right to over ride Quorum! This isn't a Game! This is "OUR" Government! NOT YOURS!
We stand with President Trump & we have faith in Sen. Hatch & other true leaders to move America forward!
I guess I find it funny this old man is so mad at the dems for doing EXACTLY what the GOP did to POTUS44 for 10 months!
Judge Merrick B. Garland! Remember him @OrrinHatch - you are the hypocrite!!!
No @OrrinHatch! The most pathetic thing was when McConnell and the GOP publicly declared to obstruct Obama in every way
I'm sure he has a strong stomach for consuming large quantities of verbal vomit from Trump.
DISGRACEFUL calling your colleagues idiots. I can't imagine how you would react if a Democrat said the same.  Shame!
Did you ask him to introduce you to Putin?
@OrrinHatch @sltrib what did the GOP do for 8 years?
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch dems giving you a taste of your own medicine? Too bad!
.@thomaswburr Remember this is the same @OrrinHatch who caused the2000economic crash with his call forJusticeDepartment breakup of Microsoft
Merrick Garland, remember him? do you know hypocrisy when you see it, Mr. Burr? #democracy
@OrrinHatch @sltrib  Orrin suck my dick old prune did already
@OrrinHatch Love ur quote today "dereliction of duty." kind of reminds me of senatrs who sat on their hands 4 10mths on SCOTUS
I hope Senator Hatch will be calm & reasoned voice to balance Trump & Bannon's extremism. Bannon=unelected

Two words: Merrik Garland.
@OrrinHatch Trump is destroying our country. Where's your spine? Stand up against the traitor or he will take you down too.
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch Extreme vetting on cabinet members should have been your job Senator Hatch. You enable Trump

Sessions better keep a bag packed-if he defends the Constitution, he'll be FIRED

@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch   Crickets from Senator Hatch during weekend crisis.  #MidTermsAreComing #Impeach #doyourjob
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch please do not confirm Betsy DeVos.
is destroying Obamacare really worth causing a civil war in this country?
@OrrinHatch @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch Sham on you Mr. Hatch!
The ability to move forward fast on decisions is not always impulsive.  Trump is moving fast on the decisions he has all ready thought abt.
Decisions like ethnic cleansing in America. He wants a poorly educated Aryan race to rule.
Please help get control of Trump's impulsive behavior.
