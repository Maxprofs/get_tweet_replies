@ChaseVS101 
Gonna be at least a half dozen Utah fans there!
Maybe like 40
Clemson and Florida state are playing and you chose Utah?
This is going to be a good game.
yeahhh boiii. Two best teams in the Pac-12 about to have a serious showdown in ROCKING LOUD Rice Eccles.
#WASHvsUTAH
PAC 12 is soft
wow. Never heard that before. Straight from your bullshit SEC talking points memo. UDub would kill UT
UW would kill Tennessee by 21.
UW means Wisconsin not Washington
OK, in that case, UW (U dub) would beat them by 28 :-)
lolol
Wisconsin vs Nebraska is a better game
PSA: BYOB
WOOOOOF go dawgs
Utah over Clemson/FSU in Doak at night... Okay then
Utah wins
nebraska vs Wisconsin or clemson vs Florida state....Obviously utah vs. Washington right!?!?!?
Clemson vs FSU? Why? Clemson is hot, FSU not. Ask Louisville and N. Carolina. This is about match ups and this is a good 1
can't wait to see you all in Salt Lake City
this game over Nebraska-Wisconsin? Rrrrrriiiiiigggghhhhhhtttttttt
they just did a Wisconsin game which is why they didnt pick it
true that
.@CollegeGameDay can't wait!  #GoUtes
@tracerobb17 @CollegeGameDay 
   Go Trace! Great time coming up for U & Cousins
he doesn't like the DJ
@sTru25 @maragronseth
why are you not going to florida st clemson?
BOULDER SOON
NOT
so you DO know the PAC-12 exists! I was starting to think you were the SEC Game Day...
can't believe they going to this game over Clemson/fsu honestly.
7-0 vs 7-1 versus 7-0 vs. 5-2. What's hard to understand?
lame.
2 better games you're all dumb

that's the demise of Utah... Stay away... Please.....
get @89SteveSmith or @weddlesbeard to be the quest, you will be impressed.  #GoUtes
@KirkHerbstreit Gameday should be going to Tallahassee next week. We all know that's the bigger game.
L
That's Busch
oh so u do know there at teams in the west, thought this had turned into the sec network #backthepac
Nebraska vs Wisconsin bro
thank you jish
UW and Utah for @CollegeGameday…and @olcrimson will also be flyin’
Salt Lake City, you're next! We're headed to Washington-Utah for Week 9. 
sleeping on FSU vs Clemson.... I see how it is
dawgs toughest game of the season on the road #trap
Utah-Wash over Nebraska-Wisconsin??? I respectfully disagree! #GoBigRed #Huskers
@YFanGirl_JB the Utes don't like the word sissy
I have a bonor
that game over nebraska/wisconsin, or even Clemson/FSU? Pac 12 is soft.
only chance to go to the Pac12. No big games on the west coast. Ore and Stan being bad hurts. NU win means OSU NU next week
Wow! I didn't think ESPN knew they play football out west
@JeffBechthold Have a GREAT week! #PurpleReign
how do you decide where to go? I can't imagine you guys making a decision saying "hmmm Utah sounds nice, let's go to Utah!"
Pretty lame that you ignore a top 10 matchup in Big 10 for a weak PAC 12 matchup. Wouldn't happen if that were in the SEC
@SportsCenter How come the top ten Big 10 matchup isn't gameday?
@KirkHerbstreit feel bad for you to have to fly all the way from Utah for FSU game
??? You all know Clemson and FSU are playing right? lol
thank god. I thought we'd have to watch Tennessee for the 5th time
#bowdowntowashington #GoDawgs
slow weekend huh
SLC.  Nice town.  You may wanna leave a bit early and hit Boulder for a couple of days prior.  #theriseisreal.
I can't believe y'all chose to go there over the Clemson/FSU game. Bad choice.
Go Utes !
Sorry to disappoint you but we're 6-0. Gibson's defense is legit. Bye TCU. Let's Goooooo!
#HailWV #Mountaineers #Big12 #WVU
Did you ask the SEC and ACC permission before you decided to finally do a game out west? #Pac12FB #GoBuffs
If Utah could go ahead and do Louisville a solid by knocking off Washington, that'll be great.
We need to have a solid win here!!!
coming to UofU in Sack Lake City!!!
Utah is amped
YEAH Baby...
@robbie_hurt
@zcj1999 @jmjenkins13
Please go back to President's Circle! Best place on campus!
so many upset people that another game wasn't picked lol. go dawgs looking forward to this game.
@Molli_Ronish @ThatOneSonicGuy
awesome!
#gohuskies
@camirichards we should go in our byu gear
how does #NEBvsWIS 2 top 10 teams get beat out by some PAC-12 teams? The B1G has a better match up. We know WA. Is gonna win
@leefitting Go DaWgs!
@espn great system college football thx
..my gorgeous Wife is Ready. .GO UTES
#PurpleReign
@trent10e
Potential #7 at #8 isn't as appealing? Or B1G haters?
@cbfowler just said coming to Tallahassee at the end of OSU-PSU broadcast. Which is it? What the heck.
@Last___Kings___
invite Eric Weddle and Steve Smith Sr for guest pickers.  The Ravens have a bye.
or The Rock
over Clemson- Fsu? That's just sad
Sad is how bad FSU looked against Louisville. Why see another blowout?
disrespected Nebraska you'll see 15-0!!!
I guess yall forgot about Clemson and Florida State
that game over Clemson/FSU?
.@CollegeGameDay Can't wait to see Utes signs like this one. #PAC12
is that a joke???  Why
#8 Nebraska vs #10 Wisconsin you're unbelievable...
Tom Hackett as pseudo celebrity guest picker...? #PuntersArePeopleToo
over Clemson FSU. Lame
no love for the biggest matchup of next week @BadgerFootball v @HuskerFBNation. Top 10 matchup that will decide @bigten west
yeah man! Hopefully Guest is Eric Weddle @weddlesbeard or Steve Smith Sr.
@ESPNCFB ESPN in Pac territory; Desmond n Herbie better update maps on their phones.  #longoverdue
not at @BadgerExaminer  v @HuskerFBNation? No. 10 v No. 8? @bigten west decision game? What a joke you've become!
Whomp
@espn Ohio state #2 Come on man! Really... no hard teams & Penn State going to win. What a joke. Rankings are wrong
@MermaryFaith
Will it be at Presidents Circle again? How do we find info to make it there in time for the beginning of the show?
! #pac12 #Utes
The Utes get shalaked next weekend. Going to be ugly.
@Molli_Ronish 
absolute garbage decision
@MSU_Football this could have been us but you sucking! #goblue
@ESPNCFB not gonna come see FSU get thrashed by the Tigers?

Good call
welcome back to SLC!  #GoUtes @Utah_Football @ESPNCFB @KirkHerbstreit @ESPN_ReceDavis @ESPN_Pac12blog
Go Dawgs!!!!
@ESPNCFB how about Nebraska vs Wisconsin? Top ten matchup? Oh, yeah, you can only do big 10 games with urban Myers
2010 was a blast when you guys came!!!
WHAT A JOKE
Hopefully Utah shows better. Last year they did not show too well. Bad turnout and terrible signs.
my home city by my team visiting 
, congrats on helping the ESPN family of networks dog the Huskers even more.
Don't understand not being at a top 10 matchup with HUGE implications. SMH @CollegeGameDay
Go Dawgs!
@ESPNCFB sooo.... FSU vs Clemson?
There's a better game in Tallahassee...  SMH
@LeRon_8
shoulda been Tallahassee
UTAH
weak
@URedZone yea!!! #goUtes
ugh... Sounds boring. Pac 12 football is awful. Utah will end the season out of the top 25 at 9-3 or 8-4... Too bad
passed up a top 10 match up in Madison?
@UW_Football
@Albeezyy_
the HEAT is real....
.@CollegeGameDay wow!
what about the better matchup of 4 Clemson and 13 FSU? What a joke...
@UW_Football Woof
@KirkHerbstreit how can you ignore the top ten matchup in Madison!? More proof you guys are ignoring the huskers...
get @89SteveSmith as the guest! #GoUtes
@UtahPigBus Hell yes.
#GoHuskies!

@espn @Chevi_D
go Washington
too hyped for next Saturday! #goutes
getting my sign ready.  Go dawgs!!!
@msingley01 we should take the boys up to this.
let's do it.
guest picker suggestion: @weddlesbeard @89SteveSmith both on bye week. Bring @Utah_Football all time favorite players home!
yeah, cause that's better than FSU/Clemson
Good to see @CollegeGameDay acknowledge that there's great football being playing outside the SEC.
@K_Kvam
cougars vs huskies.. nothings more exciting than Utah in late October!! 2 PAC 10 universities that won't make the FINAL FOUR
What a waste! No Tallahassee? #ClemsonTigers
great! Now tell Corso there's no "r" in #Washington #GoDawgs #Woof
what do we have to do to get y'all in clinton next year?
anyone else bummed that this is on FS1?
Should be at the Neb at Wisconsin but if Neb wins no brained they be at the horseshoe in 2 weeks
Did you guys realize there's more conferences than the SEC?
@cliffcgibson here's the spotlight for u-dub
why?
there's a top 10 match up in the state of Wisconsin. #GBR
@MUSSemeritus Yeah Buddy!!! 
@BoozeBaird
