And you will do at least 15 times that. You should strive to make things better not worse @GOP
and 22M more will lose insurance with your horrendous bill
Your sabotage is accelerating ACA problems.
Then it's about time we propose a single-payer system and quit this BS. Healthcare can only function well when it functions for all!
So you want to add 20 million to that incredible amount of stress? Good plan.
Don't Bail-out insurance companies! WE put u back n office ovr & ovr again to REPEAL & REPLACE! Not another entitlement 4 lazy people-refuge
Especially if you make it happen by defunding.
Rates too high. Working families cannot afford premiums but don't qualify for medicaid.
Pretty much guaranteed to happen with GOP elimination of funding for risk corridors, not to mention states not expanding Medicare.
Medicaid, not Medicare
Still a heckuva lot better than 22 million. And this is misleading. You've caused the instability. And there's no death spiral. #GOPLies

So you plan to raise that 2M by 20M o THANK YOU for FUCKING AMERICA UP THE ASS ORIN. You RELIGIOUS GRIFTER spiral this!
And what will our "leaders" do?  Will it be everyone on their own in these "United States"?
It's because POTUS ceased paying subsidies so that insurers would pull out of ACA-THEN DID!  No surprise there. You caused it - now fix it
Really repubs get POTUS AGENDA passed you quit tweeting DO YOUR JOB you allowed Dimms to take my healthcare and kept yours
The truth hurts. GOP leaders knew he was unfit and still backed him. Cringeworthy political gaffe of all time???
You counting the ones that was forced by law to have it mostly Latinos @SenateGOP @SenateDems. @CNN @nytimes @ABCNews.
And how many more millions will lose healthcare with your death plan? At least 22 million! All of you will go down in history as traitors.
Get on board, or get out of the Senate!  We gave you everything you asked for to repeal Obamacare...Replacmnt s/n include Govt Run Hlthcare!
Everyone remember: the committee of 8 MEN (no women) that created latest plan have a net worth of over $84 million. Think they're worried?
Put politics aside-You're playing with the lives of Americans. GOP & DEMS: put on your big boy/girl pants, sit down, & work on improving ACA
Stop ! Work with Dems to fix ACA
Take this down - this is the Official twitter feed of Senate Republicans & you post a disrespectful meme?  Is this the #trumpito influence?

Hurry, pass anything for the base is so stupid the won't know they got hosed! Secure 2018 w sabatoging ACA it's working town halls prove it!
Thanks to your do nothing party .. with everyone in limbo .. after 8 years I will add ..useless
The same insurance company lobbyists that are sitting with you to debate our health care. Same ones who ensured we got market-based ACA!
Pack your bags, you complicit SOB's.
And even more will lose access so that Republicans can cut taxes for their wealthy friends if their health care bill passes.
hmmm, nonsensical. Like you refusing to work with dems to provide a bill everyone would like. 2018 is coming.
Put the @HouseGOP picture on the white house lawn up when you speak of Americans loosing health coverage.  Talk about the market sabotage!!
PUTIN's PUPPETS
SO THAT MEANS KICKING 22MILLION MORE OUT OF COVSFAVR IS EXCUSABLE? YOU LIARS!!!!
No matter what you say or print you cannot justify the Senate bill. It serves one purpose only and that is a tax cut for the rich.
@BarackObama  is #Responsible Along With Those Who Passed It @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
So what are you going to do????  Bicker or get something worthy done???
@senorrinhatch 
So.... 2 million losing healthcare is bad, but 22 million losing it is better?

You're just messing' with us now.
While 300 million lost their country to a foreign adversary.
#TrumpRussia
#TrumpRussia
#TrumpRussia
Please say No to this horrific healthcare bill.. Veterans will lose so will people with pre-existing conditions
I bet the GOP is celebrating that
then why won't you repeal it?You have lost ALL MORAL AUTHORITY TO SPEAK for Voters. Lies upon Lies. no more bailouts for insurance companies
Congrats on your sabotage! BTW 2M is peanuts compared to what your god awful plan will do. How about actually helping people FFS
More #GOP scare tactics.
So ask yourself, "What did we do to stop that, or even give more ppl coverage?" #NotADamnThing 
Have another big helping of #Schadenfreude
Ha ha that's  crazy just like our politians
NATIONWIDE ALL INSURERS DISAGREE - instead it's GOP sabotaging ObamaCare
So your answer is "what's another22 million?"
Time for a universal single payer system
22 MILLION WILL LOSE THEIR INSURANCE BECAUSE OF YOU.  MORE WILL BUY CHEAP INSURANCE THAT COVERS NOTHING BUT AN INSURANCE CARD.
Seriously! Every single tweet is about Obamacare, not your replacement. WHY IS THAT?
And 22 million more under the GOP healthcare plan.  Vote NO!  Sit down with Democrats & work out a good plan. Not just tax cuts 4 the rich.
@senorrinhatch @TheWeek And your solution is to pile 22 million on top of that? And it took you 7 years to work out that plan?
Partisanship and spin are the problem. #federalist10
Because of your failure to fund it , nice try 

Read the comments. No one supports this bullshit except repubs in congress and financial elite. Govern For The People!
23 million lose with trump care in :2018 not health care tax breaks for rich cut medicate to pay for it TRUE
@SenCoryGardner I'm counting on you to vote #ForOurPatients & oppose any bill that slashes Medicaid's funding.
""DO NO HARM TO NO COLORADAN OR AMERICAN!""


Due to republicans' effort to sell it as negative. More people insured & is opposite of your plan, and no 1% tax breaks







You fail to mention the GOP's hand in causing the problems for ACA.




I wish you'd read my faxes, I'm a constituent and the ACA saved my life. My child needs it too. DM me, let's chat.
"DO NO HARM TO NO AMERICAN!"
GOP really is the party of poor taste. 
I suppose I am finally done trying to talk sense to a solid brick wall of will full ignorance.



Yeah. Well. It turns out ACA isn't collapsing after all. READ this: http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/study-obamacare-not-collapsing-n781486 …
Your party has worked to destabilize the exchanges, #ACA at its core is the the #GOP proposal from the #90s.  Hypocrites.

2 million vs 24 million. Looks like Obamacare is the winner.






What are y'all doing about it Can you not get anything done what's wrong with y'all you are so pathetic Not leaders

This is your excuse for adding another 20 mil ? Remember--this year is YOUR watch--YOU are setting the rules-the 2 mil r YOUR doing -MAN UP!






The only way for Obamacare to fail if Congress does not fund. The rest is lies.
The real victims will be 24 million losing coverage and 100 million more find out their cost is still going up as benefits are being slashed
WHAT? U have the idiocy to cite Ocare foibles WHILE U CANNOT REPEAL IT?!! GET THE HELL OUT! U DO NOT BELONG IN US GOV! @GOP @SenateMajLdr
24 million uninsured with SenateNoCare. Is Mitch working with T to give rich Russia tax breaks in the US?
Senate GOP
Sure they did.
U all cause whatever uncertainty in the marketplace deliberately!
That's a whole lot less than 22 million.
U are sabotaging the ACA, its not working-1 example
http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/26/trump-administration-kills-obamacare-ads-for-healthcaregov.html …
if u press it'll lead to single payer, fix the cost not the HC
What are you talking about? The main point of Obamacare is giving people who do not have employer health benefits, the chance to buy plans.
Fake @gop healthcare bill...SCHEME!
So let's throw 22 million more off of healthcare with the terrible #Republican bill? Makes sense. #voteNO #VoteNoBCRA @JohnCornyn @tedcruz
American people fell for this kind of quick catchy meaningless 140 character sound byte, lies. That face gave us #Trump. NEVER AGAIN!
So let's just add millions more!
Because the GOP sabotaged it !!!
Thanks to the gop.
Because Donald Trump stopped implementing that #aca law as designed & as required by his oath of office. Implementation the law as designed
ACA surviving despite Republican sabotage. Stop spreading misinformation about the law
Death spiral? Obamacare insurers may be having ‘best year’ yet under ACA http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article160601649.html …
Despite sabotage by Republicans....
#BREAKING: Study shows ObamaCare markets are "stabilizing," not collapsing http://hill.cm/TGEd2qH  
So your answer is to drop 22 million more people? You had 7 years of griping and this is what you give us? Dumping people from insurance?
The market is shit. Will be shittier with GOP plan, but it needs some serious reform to work for the majority of Americans.
FYI
Health insurers selling on #ACA exchanges just had their most profitable first quarter ever #BCRA http://wapo.st/2sIyR7U?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.5879c3b663a4 …
Stop funding Obamacare like you have for the past 6 years.
Hey Libtards and Fake Media, this is not called "stabilizing",
For 6 years you did NOTHING to fix problems with #Obamacare and instead sabotage it and sued it. SHAME.
Then get Obamacare repealed already and quit giving the Libtards ammo. This should be a no-brainer on repeal. Stop yapping.
And somehow in Republican world that justifies kicking 22 million more off insurance. #FixACA
That's not great and should be fixed, but it ignores the fact that 22 million more lose insurance under your plan.
/ Health insurance companies pulling out of Obamacare will cause this. CEOs don't need salaries in the millions. #Greed
This crisis was created by @GOP & @SenateGOP to rally support for their evil bill so they can pass it & cash checks from their rich donors.
Insurance CEOs gain untaxed bonuses yearly & the rich get tax breaks they do not need. Average Americans get the shaft.
Get healthcare done or come out with points as to why you can't! Be honest with your voters
2018
Last time I checked @gop was in control of the government since January 20th. This is on you and you know who.
You can do better! 22 million. 
And how many will lose it under your plan? You guys are *terrible* at this.
What kind of healthcare do they have in Russia?
Then repeal ACA. Do what you tried to do under Obama and promised. #Repealdontreplace #Freemarkethealthcare
Bull shit lying traitors!!!!
You can't have it both ways. People can't "choose" not to insure under unaffordable BCRA and "lose" it under ACA.
Fix it! Just provide #Americans the same health plan, benefits - at same income/affordability ratio - you receive as our employees!
Stop the lying. If you feel the poor deserve to suffer and the wealthy elite deserve more money just say it.

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
Yeah your plans aren't working so good, because you had 7 years to come up with solutions and you did not.  LIARS.
This. Should be beneath you. Sadly, it isn't.
Do your job fix Obamacare , stop with the fake news reporting!
So you want to add to that number rather than work with the @SenateDems?
Man you senate Republicans are so stubborn. It's time for you to reach across the aisle and fix ACA. please stop wasting time.
That #TrumpCare dog don't hunt
Maybe stop holding payments hostage and making backdoor deals with billionaires to take away ins from 20 mil more?!? YOU ALL LIE!
Your plan strips healthcare from 22 Million Americans. 
Twenty Two Million. The GOP has absolutely lost their way. Your proposal is immoral.
Fake news.


And the GOPDoesntCare bill will kick 22-25 million off healthcare coverage. What do you hate Americans so much?

.@tedcruz: "Govt bureaucracies by their nature are inefficient, are often unresponsive, are cumbersome & that's been exacerbated in the VA." 
what is that sh*t ass quality screenshot all about? I thought you were fcking bankrolled?? #ratf**kers
If 2M is bad to you, I don't understand why you're complacent about 22M.   Pls explain why GOP plan is better rather than why ACA is bad.
And your response to that is to take 11x's that number off healthcare? Are you having a "hey Dems, hold my beer...watch this" moment?!?!
#liars #thieves
Work across party lines. All lives matter, not just the rich.
As a Republican myself, I think your group is doing a terrible job, and either need to compromise your thoughts or RESIGN..You are the SWAMP
The "why" matters. Why did these people lose their insurance? Simple. TOO EXPENSIVE! Thank you government mandates!
When will people realize the the GOP is doing ISIS's job?
Killing Americans to benefit the wealthy #Shame
I hate Obama
And the working middle class that funds this swamp mess, can't afford theirs
Thanks to #GOP sabotaging ACA. Stop lying! GOP r killing millions of children, elderly and disabled. #trumpcarekills

Keep those ads coming. Doing the job you were elected to do is insignificant. Soon you will be too.
The system has been sabotaged. You only have to honor the agreement that the government made with the insurance companies about subsidies.
You are playing a power game with people's lives. The @GOP is fully responsible for the reprehensible inaction that is crumbling the system.
Lies....just look at how many protesters there are in the capitol against your proposal !
They seem to have too much time on their hands while some of us are working
Don't worry...we'll keep fighting
