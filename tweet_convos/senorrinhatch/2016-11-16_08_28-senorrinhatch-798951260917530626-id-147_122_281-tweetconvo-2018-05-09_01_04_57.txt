I understand that. But am asking Repubs to stand against racism. Do you support Brannon's appointment?
I do! Do u know anything about him other than what the #MSM has said? I researched the man, & truly believe he IS NOT #racist!
why do you believe he's not racist? Onus is on you to prove considering the vast reality based evidence that he is
dated #MexicanAmericans! Rite after 9/11 a VERY good friend of mine I worked w/ is a #MuslimAmerican, I was the ONLY 1 that...
a Muslim friend too wow you're def not racist wow wow.   Check Bannon out though if you're truly a supporter...
well, u know what, i'm going to support the person that wants to SAVE lives over someone who takes MILLIONS FROM
Congrats but the ppl r watching! We elected #Trump & the @GOP needs 2 #Unite behind him! Ur up 4 re-el n 2yrs..we r

They didn't choose you, they had no choice in the matter.

How much cocaine money did you pay them anyway?  Just curious?  Yep, cocaine trafficking is your game isn't it? YEP
And now it's time to investigate Mr. Trump's conflicts of interest. You owe it to America!

The problem with hypocrisy. @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP
I'm wondering if you share Stephon Bannon' opinion that there are too many Asian Americans in Silicon Valley? If so wut 2 do?
Negotiation is good except for repealing ObamaCare, SCOTUS nominees, & defunding Planned Parenthood. On these, no compromise.
are you going to do the people's bidding? or are you going to destroy the party and the country?
After your election u said “we need presidency”

 Ok They say u r the best Now Don’t Blow It Boss KICK some #MAGA

Drain the swamp!
LEADER OF DOING NOTHING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING FOR YOURSELF.

@SpeakerRyan / You BETTER do the people's business the way the people want it done! #MAGA

looking forward to you filling the next liberal SCOTUS vacancy with a likeminded replacement, as per your Scalia precedent
Whatever you say, @SenateMajLdr. Howza 'bout you stop being a hindrance to doing what's right for the American people, mkay? @SenateGOP
Good, you can now destroy FDR's legacy of the New Deal.  One polio man to another polio man.
was hoping you would resign!
well that was an unfortunate set back. I was hoping they would replace your RINO ass with a real conservative.
Handle This
The Clinton Fdn uses foreign $ to fund AIDS treatment for 11M, and Hillary's "crooked."

Rudy pockets it and is SecState material.…
we are watching and waiting for you to execute President Elects plan. Get to work and QUICKLY!
You look worried. You should be. Trump wants to be Trump. If you're with him, NP. You're against him? GOD HELP U...
now, do what you were elected to do....for the people!!!
Help Trump serve the American people or be considered part of the swamp that needs to be drained. We're watching.

I thought we were draining the swamp?
Turtle noises
You may control the Big 3. But you will never have a united Country behind you!
#NotMyPresident
Then you are part of the problem. You are dividing the nation and standing in the way of progress
You and the Senate are PETHETIC! You all have been cry babies and have done nothing for 8 years except obstruct!
Tell Mitch McConnell (202-224-2541) that white supremacy has NO place in the White House #DumpBannon
Grow a spine and use the nuclear operation if needed and not rollover.
why? He looks and sounds like a turkey
try not to screw it up
How much vacation time do you Senators need? The government runs till end of year. Do your job!!
you better pass what we voted Trump in for. Don't get in his way!
you need to ride off into the sunset with Harry reid

Bannon in the White House is a declaration of war on  any nonwhite, nonXn person in America. We can read the signs.
This president-elect deserves same treatment that you gave Obama in terms of cooperation.
Funny how coal employment is suddenly a private sector activity after 8 years of yor War on Coal Senator Fraud.
It’s not everybody who can ignore their conscience.

If it's an honor, act honorably and do good things for our Nation.  CHANGE!!!
What will your excuse be this time for letting #Democrats act like they won?

@McConnellPress @SenateGOP things just keep getting worse!!!
@McConnellPress @SenateGOP  old codgers need to step down especially mcconnell
Living,  but barely effective nor breathing proof. We need TERM LIMITS in the SENATE.
Do something that makes a difference instead of serving your own "old money" interest! #SquanderedPower
It's a travesty, this squish is still leader?
You may have been chosen by #GOP but doesn't mean #AmericanPeople agree & were watching. Time to get things DONE!!
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
As leader do something about Sen Reid misusing the Senate well to slander people.
hopefully U will FINALLY do your job and actually help #PresidentElectTrump clean the swamp u created!
It’s an honor to once again have been chosen by my @SenateGOP colleagues to continue serving as their leader in the #Senate.
有些事别妥协。坚持原则有什么不好啊。党的利益是第一位的。党内这么多势力懂得均衡才是上策啊。我们才能最终团结在一起。不要让商界大佬们失望，今天的结果我们来得不容易呀。大家付出了多少努力啊。要珍惜要信任我们的民众眼光与那份期许期盼。
no more excuses!!!! Do what Trump wants!
Do your job this time.  We gave you the majority 2 years ago & you stabbed us in the back.  Enter @realDonaldTrump
you need to retire and let a real conservative take your place
@McConnellPress @SenateGOP would have preferred someone else Mr TPP
