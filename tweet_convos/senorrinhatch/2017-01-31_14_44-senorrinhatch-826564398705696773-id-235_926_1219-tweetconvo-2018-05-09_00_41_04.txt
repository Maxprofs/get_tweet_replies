this will 100% come back to bite the dems with upcoming elections, guaranteed
Sweetie, electing trump has ignited a spark within non-trumpers that will last for years. LOL
When riots are your response you think so? 
What riots? At Berkeley and NYU? Those aren't riots. @Deplorablecasee @jonkarl @realDonaldTrump
Property destroyed, people injured (last night), Okay. Guess you need to correct Webster's then
You have to consider, too, that the violence was done by right wing nuts.
Right-wing nuts? Really? Wow! You honestly believe that?
Could be. Plenty of accusations, and the one person arrested isn't a student. I guess we'll see.
You mean qualified in your eyes don't you?
Which do you think aren't and why?
You're just as shameful as they are. If you honestly believe that than I pity your world. You should be embarrassed
starters you didn't list one reason. Those aren't reasons they're opinion.
The Democrats are shutting down the country.
Lol That's like blaming the Russians for WWII. @jonkarl @realDonaldTrump
If the Russians hadn't signed the non-aggression pact, Hitler would not have invaded France.
Democrats = hate, intolerance, ignorance
@ChrisStigall @realDonaldTrump - I have a question that has nothing to do with the issue at hand. Who here favors term limits?
Dems obstructing now. Reps obstructed last year. Both parties do it, because the  obstructers don't get voted out.
So what.  You are nattering nay-bob of negativity.  Am praying for you and your hateful mean spirited attitude.
@GARock945 @realDonaldTrump
That is real reporting!  TY
Following :)
Well of course. Because TRUMP!
And why aren't you, the Press, pushing back at the Democrats? Is it because you guys & gals are "in their pocket"?
When in the past did the opposition party boycott the hearings 4 each nominee presented by a #POTUS - tell us Jon
due to the futile childish boycott of demtards who spit on elections outcome. GOP is showing a backbone at last.
If only the noms had been vetted, submitted timely disclosures, and...what am I leaving out? Oh yeah, remotely qualified.
Because...
@seanmdav @realDonaldTrump To change that call, text, email, fax, and use social media to call them out then keep doing it.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Maybe he should nominate qualified people, Mr. Hatch.
@guypbenson @realDonaldTrump One word:  OBSTRUCTION
Were you complaining when Republicans spent the last 8yrs doing it, out of interest?
only just saw this response. If you don’t think Trump’s actions affect the rest of the world you’re out of your tree.
Well, they are showing a modicum of sense.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump payback for GARLAND!!
@KatMcKinley @realDonaldTrump SHAMEFUL!!
Shameful.  Puts America at risk.
@KatMcKinley @realDonaldTrump some are getting paid with our taxes and not doing their job. Pathetic
Shame on the Democrat senators. They are acting like two year olds.
not really comparable unless you also add nominees' qualifications/competence and ethical status to the analysis
@sahilkapur @realDonaldTrump The nominees show their tax returns?
That's what happens when you nominate incompetent people.
Let the progressive socialists continue their childish behavior. Makes 2018 mid-term elections easy. .@jonkarl .@1Bunny4T .@realDonaldTrump
well none of them deserve it. Maybe don't nominate such losers. Sad!
No. This is the most of any President in at least 40 years. Period.
@sahilkapur @realDonaldTrump 1 is too many.
@sahilkapur @realDonaldTrump The 2018 elections will be a blood bath for democrats and Republicans will have a super majority
Blame Obama for choosing qualified candidates
in fairness there's an awful lot of conflict of interest to tease out.
Dems taking ball and going home.  Great example for spineless quitters everywhere.
>>@nytimes @washingtonpost @latimes   @CBSNews @NBCNews @cnnbrk @msnbc @nprnews @politico NEWS TIP 4U OTHER HACKS
Seems like just yesterday the MSM was worried about how slow the Trump team was picking nominees.  Now? meh.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump well it is the worst list of selections in 200 years so...
and that is precisely
 why #draintheswamp is necessary
Dems playing to base believe this helps them, however like most extreme measures figures to come back & bite them.
The nominees to complete the kakistocracy suck.
Too bad, so sad
it will lead to civil war if they do, of course their petty agenda is more important than the survival of America!
@jimmygarner @realDonaldTrump Jesus couldn't resurrect the Democratic socialist party in the future.
@jimmygarner @realDonaldTrump that's a sign that trump is cleaning the swamp karlm
.@jonkarl @pinksugar61 @realDonaldTrump #Pelosi can't stand on her values uses mr. Carson's Muslim Faith manipulate the crowd for own gain
.@jonkarl @pinksugar61 @realDonaldTrump this insane protest gives #Trump supporters more Resolve to Dig In thank you #resist #followme #girl
@pinksugar61 @realDonaldTrump what does tell us about Dems..they don't work w/you if they don't get their way
Just wait @DNC - just wait until 2018 - We the People are watching your games and we're not happy.
what a disgrace what they do to our country. It's a constant battle riots tantrums fake news knitted VAGINA hats!
@Keeblerqueen @realDonaldTrump The American taxpayers shouldn't have to put up with this bullshit The democrats need to grow up
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump oh gee obstruction pissing you off? who would have thought.
Thank you SenHatch for speaking for the majority of American voters. We do not have a microphone.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Yay! Every little bit counts! Perhaps they're actually listening to the people.
He's appointed crooks and liars! Thank God for Democrats! The "Foreclosure King" and stock liar? SMH.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump the system works! Dipshits shouldn't be cabinet officials!!
@juniperbreeze07 @realDonaldTrump it's going to come back to bite them in ass they will lose more seats, ppl r sick of their BS
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump bottom line nominees aren't competent. This admin is a #shitshow
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Maybe he should have nominated more qualified candidates?
@HotlineJosh Worth pointing out this was caused by a) huge delay naming them and b) they couldn't get their paperwork done on time
Good. They're a bunch of inexperienced backslapping fundraisers for @GOP. The Citizens United peeps
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump need to drain the swamp, maybe we can get things done.
@Trumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump that is Mitch McConnell's fault. Thanks for your help Colonel.
Shell less Turtle was waiting for his wife's Swearing In. Priorities.
@MarieMa49685063 @realDonaldTrump Time to change this.
And yet he's still accomplishing so much!
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump WRONG http://ln.is/fivethirtyeight.com/o7Nsj …
This is basically the kid complaining that the dog ate his homework.
He also had the fewest nominees finish the paper work required by @McConnellPress for confirmation
Good! All his nominees are terrible. Shame on you for not standing up for teachers!
PURGE THE GOP IN 18! WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE
no one wants them confirmed because they are the worst nominees! Nominated by the worst "president"
Where's the media outrage about shutting down the gov't
and when was their paperwork submitted?
people take note of what your elected representative is doing or NOT doing. Call them!!
@CelesteHerget @realDonaldTrump shows world that Globalist can't let go that easy, but the Teflon Don will kick their aspirations!
@rlmiller10 @realDonaldTrump I reckon once you've had power for almost a decade, it's hard to let go? And why is AG fired a problem
@rlmiller10 @realDonaldTrump unconstitutional? Perhaps by left Isle standards? If it were Obama? I've never been more confused,...
They're disgusting! No matter how much they obstruct, they're Not gonna make Hillary the Prez! 
.@jonkarl @BasedMelGibson @realDonaldTrump
@BasedMelGibson @realDonaldTrump Due to l longest temper tantrum in 40 yrs.
Get with it @congressdotgov @TheDemocrats you're putting our Nation in danger. Quit being petulant. Ppl r wise
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump That is, in my opinion, because the swamp is scared to death of Trump values. No stopping DJT.
@BasedMelGibson @realDonaldTrump Absolute biggest cry babies throwing the biggest tantrums rather than do their jobs like adults 
Dems are being both childish and corrupt.
And they will pay a price for it.
@WendyHaring @realDonaldTrump - what goes around comes around.
@joemcguire @realDonaldTrump Dems have abrogated their responsibilities for simply political reasons. Hurting our country
: "The Senate has only confirmed 4 of @realDonaldTrump's cabinet-level nominees as of…" #1 in United States http://www.toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=826561747175743490 …
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Also, how many ethics laws were glazed over for the 4 confirmed? #Hypocrites #115GOPRapetheNation
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Also, they have the greatest combined wealth&least amount of actual experience of any in history.
We don't need a plutocracy in this country. They've gobbled up most of the wealth, we don't won't to be ruled.
GOOD! and are you happy about Bannon in NSC?
It's a shame that this process is so slow. They need to change it. Presidents should be able to put picks in.
VOTERS NEED TO REMEMBER TO DRAIN THE SWAMP
Aren't these some of the most least qualified cabinet picks in 40 years?
If they'd stop lying in their hearings, maybe they'd get a vote. But they can't, so screw them.
.@jonkarl @dandrezner @realDonaldTrump good it goes along nicely with his BIGLY disapproval numbers.
@seanmdav @realDonaldTrump Trump should abolish the departments the Senate won't confirm. Do we really need a Sec of Ed?
.@jonkarl @dandrezner @realDonaldTrump Pick better nominees.
@irisbreeze @realDonaldTrump he also submitted them the latest
@dandrezner @realDonaldTrump I feel certain that will change just as soon as Trump nominates proper candidates.
.@jonkarl @realDonaldTrump good, slow 'em down!
This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOR THE US! We won't forget or forgive the Dems if something goes wrong! @SenSchumer
@politicalwire @realDonaldTrump Someof them didn't get in ethics paperwork until a few days before the hearing.
@SteveDeaceShow @realDonaldTrump 
Really? Why?
@JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump By 1/27/09 all obamas appointees had been confirmed except hhs, labor and commerce.
More truth in Real Time w John Avlon*** (w obscenities), than in every word spoken by Fox News.
Shameful embarrassing our Country for political pandering
Maybe because they are the least qualified, most conflict-of-interest rich nominees in that time?
is that the only thing you notice different in first 10 days of this WH?
democrats dont care about Taxpaying hardworking citizens
but republicans are obstructionist!
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump what could go wrong with wall street millionaires and oil tycoons running our gov.?
By Dem design...but, try as they might, they are powerless to do anything but look like fools.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Because he nominated a bunch of swamp rats!
democrat obstructionists
If the Red State Dems stick with Schumer & Pelosi, and keep acting the way that they are, that should happen.
.all part of their ridiculous  condescending pettiness...
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Merrick Garland.
Cngrs putting us @ risk as they leave gaps in pstns. Call cngrs & dmnd they do their job & stp playng w/ ur safety
maybe he should have put up his nominees sooner. He still haven't put out many of them. This is Trumps fault
@Gunmetal_Kitten @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats are to busy screwing over the American public to do their jobs!!!
@JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump the GOP is working with the Demrats to obstruct. Smell the fear.
@demsrdopes @realDonaldTrump VOTE them OUT! Lots of Dems4Trump out there, get rid of these ppl.
He also has the lowest approval level in history.  Perhaps because his nominees lack experience & morals
@PGourevitch @realDonaldTrump #fakenews http://fxn.ws/2gkd18o  come on man why lie!?
Speaks directly to lack of: quality nominees, adequate background info provided, honesty/transparency in hearings
@RealCSI   @realDonaldTrump is supposed to be master of deals but can't make a single deal with Dems? On job training not working!
Trump cabinet is the worst of the worst.
Dems obstructionism reaching new levels. @jonkarl @realDonaldTrump
See Dog licking his nuts Redneck says. Id like to do that! Redneck2 "That Dog gonna Bite choo"! Democrats careful
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump incomplete papers on all nominees.  GOP not above rules
@RealCSI @realDonaldTrump Because they SUCK!
Betsy what's her name getting confirmed is a slap in the face of education. We are a joke now.
Not to mention the lowest quality.
Can't President Trump get his cabinet in by himself? How long is this crap going to go on w/Democrats?
How many have been vetted?All paperwork done ?
The Senate should enact the nuclear option & the hell with Democrats
Because his picks are awful
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Democrats and their nonsense makes me sick
Appalling.
GOOD!
@seanmdav @realDonaldTrump Thanks, Weepy Chuck!
@DiplomSage @realDonaldTrump babies having a tantrum; chaos & stalling is the goal! Until they can find something to impeach for
you should no better.dont b fooled by your fake media or ours .we love trump & usa
Senator: That should tell you something
make sure u report on GMA tomorrow how sorry the Dems r I doubt you or George Stephanopoulos could handle that
pathetic and embarrassing
Again, you the Republicans seem clueless and impotent as to what to do with the outrageous behavior of the Democrats. Grow a pair will you.
yea that would b the Dems unreal that they would act so juvenile right
bc the demoRats are scumbags, period.
wonder where the dems got the idea that obstruction is good?..http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/republican-party-obstructionism-victory-trump-214498 ….

Perhaps should have nominated people more qualified,
@hrhippie @realDonaldTrump #draintheswamp Time's up-asses up!
Well we just put a yahoo dancing with the stars guy in charge of our nukes. So maybe the 4 should be a 0.
crappie Democrats
childish antics of democrats,corrupt media can be blamed. America suffers but evidently you don't care
So, what? Did Obama get a vote on his Supreme Court pick? F@cking hypocrites.
Which days a lot about how Democrats put party before nation.
is illegitimate and his administration is also illegitimate, stop them at every step. Get rid of the pest.
Dems will see blow back on this. Not good to leave country without.
Because he has to deal with the communist party.
Maybe he should have spent more time choosing them? Some of his picks have serious ethical issues.
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Campaign call representative 2022243121 Campaign support the president. Share #winning

Simply because Dems are stalling.
All the Trumpie snowflakes crying about "obstruction" after their corrupt @GOP obstructed for 8 years. Hypocrites @jonkarl @realDonaldTrump
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Shameful denocrats!
Maybe because they're unusually bad?
So, either Dems are disgracefully dragging their feet, or Trump's nominees really suck.
If LDS are as hypocritical as Protestants who hate us, we are more contemptible because we know mor
maybe if they’d submitted paperwork on time, or, you know, been REMOTELY qualified for the jobs…
This is because he nominated unqualified people.
That's due to Democrats lengthening hearings.
What's your implication?
Never has a class of cabinet nominatins been so ill prepared for the position they are nominated for.
Trump didn't start transition process till post election. Usually transition paperwork is submitted much earlier.
@SenOrrinHatch @realDonaldTrump Should have sent us better candidates. Unqualified and too many conflicts of interests.
stop stop stop...their hatred of Trump is truly on a sickening level now
really?Just like you all hated Obama and laughed while the GOP obstructed his every decision?
LOVING it aren't you? #MSM OUR ENEMIES MAGA
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump the Dems are obstructionists.  I hope they pay during thir next election.  #faketearsschumer
oh and what was the GOP for the past 8 years? Lol
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump The Senate is obstructing the president and the American citizens. Good luck getting re-elected
obstructing? That's they're right. We're looking forward to mid terms!
@JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Thus why the average American (and not so average!) HATE politicians. What a shame.
