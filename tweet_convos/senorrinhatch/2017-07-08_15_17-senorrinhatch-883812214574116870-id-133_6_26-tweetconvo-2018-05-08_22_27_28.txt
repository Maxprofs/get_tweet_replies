Take a look at 2003 coverage of Judge Janice Brown's confirmation, when Hatch was serving a Judiciary Chairman-- http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/law-july-dec03-brown_10-22/ …
"The chief advocate of the law that hobbled the DEA was @RepTomMarino, a Pennsylvania Republican who is now President Trump’s nominee to become the nation’s next drug czar. It passed after @OrrinHatch negotiated a final version with the DEA."
Stayed too long after the party Orrin. You'll have tarnished all those yeara of service to your constituents in Utah. One of many states with a high rate of opioid deaths.
How DARE you tell Americans to "shut up"? You don't belong in the Senate or any other government job.
This is a complete dereliction of duties, you have failed US citizens
request to review Trump's tax returns which you are legally authorized to do as Chair of Senate Finance.
Leave my #401k alone, Senator.
What about 4 nominees of Donald Trump who are deemed wholly unqualified to serve on the federal bench? Is that the kind of bench you want to build? An ignorant and incompetent one?


.@OrrinHatch got $97,848 from @NRA, so all he'll do is talk about gun violence on the Senate floor. 

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney https://twitter.com/senorrinhatch/status/914928312010625026 …
When is undercover informant scheduled to testify about #UraniumOne Issue
So glad you're gone! Don't think your escaping Russian treason though. We know you accepted millions from Russia
ICYMI: Sen Hatch & GOP promise to raise health insurance rates, and thinks dumb Americans will blame Dems. Problem: we're not idiots.
Ex-Republican here,  YOU ARE DISGRACEFUL!  YOU TOLD PEOPLE TO #shutup OVER #ACA WHEN THEIR LIVES DEPEND ON IT.  #NEVERVOTEREDAGAIN #TURNBLUE
Sounds like your filling spots with the best of the best ya know like Jeff Sessions

The president, who says he's mad he can't meddle with the DOJ and FBI, tells the DOJ and FBI to investigate his political opponents 
Last tweet w Americans in July??! Special investigator needed to find who's lying on DEA Bill. #60Min #BigPharmaDrugGangs
How can you possibly defend your part in writing the bill that crippled the DEA’s effort to stop criminal opioid drug distribution? SHAME.
You said DEA never raised a concern.We need investigation on http://this.YOU  Took $177,000. Lives were lost! #BigPharmaDrugGangs
Wth Hatch!?!?! Your hands have blood on them !
He's so bigoted!
Blood is on your hands

In 1976, Orrin Hatch ran on term limits, criticizing his opponent's 18-year tenure.

Orrin Hatch has now been in office for 41 years.
Your remarks today about the bill hobbling the DEA do NOT absolve you from personally sponsoring a bill that exacerbated the opioid epidemic
You're pro-life?! No,u r pro $. Millionsdying in PR,millionschildren losing healthcare,u want TaxCuts4TheWealthy
ICYMI: Hatch is a vulgar, foul-mouthed ass who insults disabled folks pleading for health care.
Telling people they 'better shut up' if they want a hearing. Past time for you to resign.
Did you really tell disabled protesters to ‘shut up’ and stop trying to ‘put partisan points on the board’?? #Shame Are you a #Dotard too?
The lack of respect you showed to your fellow Americans today was disgraceful. You should be ashamed!
You are an evil man, making money by murdering people. Roast in hell.

#saveourcare #protectourcare 
You are basically threatening people's lives, yet you tell them to shut up. My mother taught me that's rude. What barn were you raised in?
@OrrinHatch @NewsHour Wow...this will crush your base, #Trump #MAGA base to make the KochBros & Top 1% richer? #DrainTheSwamp
The president cuts trade deals , our companies and governors shouldn't be in contact with foreign government ,China hostile
Legislation would be nice to leave trade with executives branch baring Americans companies from making trade deals with foreign gov
How legislation to prevent our companies that are taxpayer funded from trading with the enemy . This will destroy the industry
How about treason for our car manufacturers .
#DACA repeal = 9,562 DREAMers in UT will be subject to deportation Reject nativism.  Support #DreamAct
Sir, you need to intervene in a seriously blatant civil rights case in SLC. FBI should investigate @SLCPD for illegal arrest of caregiver
He should end new registration they had five years to register . Otherwise your supporting illegal immigration .illegals over citizens
Vote no on trumps mole
45's pardon of Arpaio makes a mockery of our justice system. DO YOUR JOB! #ImpeachTrumpPenceNOW
Why so silent on Trump's white nationalists? Sure, Bannon might be gone but why does Trump have so many bigots working with him?
So I'm confused Nazis or no Nazi ur brother already turning in his grave if u were honest it's so hard to tell with this administration
WHERE IS YOUR OUTRAGE!!!!!!!
How are feeling about your president today? After all, didn't you know there were 'very fine people' on both sides of of WW2?
"Very fine people!"

-President of US today about Nazis who chanted "Hail Trump!" and then killed three people.

Let's help #Chalottesville symbolize Neo-Nazi racism's last stand and the Rebirth of Liberty and Equality. #HeatherHeyer deserves that honor
Invoke the 25th amendment. Enough is enough. He is not sane. Protect the people of this country already.
What are you doing to protect us against our President?  Fire and Fury sounds a lot like Mother of all battles.  #SaddamTrump
@OrrinHatch Watching you on Fox Business Sunday morning & u are just full of propaganda.  Embarrassing to ever have voted R
The Dems are why u haven't passed anything. U do know u only need 50 for most things, right?  U have 52 Rs in senate. Why can't u do things?
laugh"The President is very honest"  Senator Orrin Hatch.

Damn, Orrin, you are a good liar. 
Why have you allowed Mueller to set up his own fiefdom without any oversite and any control over spending?
Orrin Hatch is now TRUMP"S BIGGEST SUPPORTER, &  happy to tie his political future to Trumps. Always does what Trump says.
Hey look guys! It's ol mitches lapdog!
It has been a nightmare watching @CNN @MSNBC smear lie & attack @POTUS #Trump his family & admin.&ignore @HillaryClinton DNC Obama crimes
Thank you& God bless you for your words today @ senate hearing Clinton DNC must b investigated not just @POTUS & his family
#FusionGPS
Senator, Thank you for speaking the truth about transgender people. You are right, it is innate and they shoud not be treated differently.
Your vote today allowing transgenders into military shows you've lost all sense of conservative values. You're an embarrassment.
@Love_The_Donald @senorrinhatch 
not to mention common sense. Stay tuned 4 the horror stories
trump is literally insane, he is insane.  And you do nothing.  Shame on you!!!!
As your last act Sir, do you think you could really get a hold of and talk some sense into @JeffFlake & @SenMikeLee ?
Too bad you are not a moral man like Mike Lee
Orrin DONT Stand For America You Stand With Traitor Trump & Russia. You Stand With Party Before Country & Will NOT Be Forgotten Election Tim
You are a dirtbag, Whorrin. You say Jr's treason not a big deal, forgetting that Kushner and Manafort were in the loop and attended.
unless you agree with Ryan & McConnell...vote NO on AHCA
let's hope during the FBI hearing you recognize the importance of confirming someone who follows the LAW & will not be "played" by Trump
You defended Jr's emails & lost the last bit of credibility when you did so. Party over country will be the @GOP downfall. Shame on you all
Nothing like picking your party and Russia over your own country old man.  #StrokeOut
You're a clown and a fraud.  Resign
Hatch is naive for an old man. Defends Junior's emails while overlooking Trump's dismissal of Russian hacking. #fail
Your reaction to the admin's now admitted collusion with Russia is sickening. You don't belong in U.S. government.
What happened to you, Orrin? You once were a man of honor and integrity now you defend the likes of Donald Trump? How could you?
Your claim that Trump family's treason is fine is dishonorable and unAmerican. But not surprising coming from you.
Hatch is "A Okay" with....

 Don Jr colluding with the Russians
 Cutting MILLIONS from Health Care
 Tax Cuts for the RICH

Enjoy!
Sad


That nothing burger is loaded with calories, fat, and all kinds of other nasty Russian condiments.
u used to b man of #integrity, now you're just an old man, #hypocrite,  supporting an unqualified president. Disgraceful #gop
Disgusting! Country before party old man!
You need to retire, old man, if you think colluding with the Russians to fix an election is just fine.
Sen.Hatch referred to Trump Jr. as a "nice young man" and insisted the accounts of his meeting with the Russian lawyer were "overblown."
Every time you speak in defense of trump and his crime family, you look complicit. You know this is #Treason. Do the Right Thing!
yeah right

hatch is a 

#PARTY_B4_PEOPLE_ASSHOLE

Former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman says Trump Jr. emails are "almost a smoking cannon." Told me "there's no question this is treason."
TREASON >>>  it's in the constitution, snowflake.
If you do nothing about the traitor in the Oval Office you are worse than him.
TrumpCare is a billionaires tax cut that the GOP won't drop even if it costs them the 2018 midterms.
#MAGA

Corporate Shill.  Sycophant.
38 years and STILL hasn't hatched yet!
