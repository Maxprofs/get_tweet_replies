Won't be able to afford it under Trumpcare eithee.
most people can't  afford health care because wages are stagnant compared to cost of living.
Because we are paying 80% of the healthcare dollar to insurance companies profits.
The real victim here is the truth.  It's like the GOP has no shame.
How about a story on how great your plan is, not how bad the Dems did. This is getting old. Tell us what you will do to fix it for EVERYONE
All of these victims are victims of greedy insurance companies not the ACA
And how is the Republican plan going to help this family?? Especially since they have a daughter with a "major disease"?
Amazed by wide variety of experiences people have with ACA.Guess it depends on the state and ins co. Shows that single payer is better way.
ACA is salvation for me. It's given me a sense of security I never had before and costs have been reasonable. Preexisting condition.
I've had no problem with care. My docs, my hospital, all available to me. Have never encountered "we don't take that plan".
When a Man has No Respect  for The Law   Then his Son has No Respect for The Law
Support the Cruz amendment! UnitedforFreedom
Likely the issue is the high cost of insurance
Fix not replace
And experts tell us it will be 5 times more with TrumpCare!
ENOUGH! YOUR PRESIDENT IS COMPLICIT IN RUSSIA'S HACKING!!! WHAT R U GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?  THEY LIED!!!! ALL COMPLICIT IF YOU DISMISS!!!!!!!
Care offering is inconsistent because Republican govs have refused to expand Medicaid & Trump Admin won't commit to Fed exchange protection
How much will a comparable plan cost under the Senate repub plan? Seriously. How much?
Medicaid for all!  Meet Shkreli, a pharma CEO that hiked drug prices by 500%, a practice GOP leaders are doing nothing about.
meet Bresch, another pharma CEO. Relative of a US senator, she also hiked prices by 500% & GOP leaders are doing nothing.
As if obama and dems did something about it? They gave them protection and destroyed competition.
Gov for & by the people works w/out corruption lies Sabotage treason. ACA works with gov Report backing. Stop the lies
 Dumpy Corrupt Trumpy
But how though?
My nieces can't afford it either. The pols and bureaucrats don't care.  No AHCA, no tax relief, nothing.  Absorbed by the swamp are you.
Pence said that he needs to pray harder
@SpeakerRyan republicans were voted by us the people to repeal and replace Obamacare! No excuses! You have the majority! Fake republicans 
No August recess until healthcare repeal. Playing into creepy Schumer and Soros. Then on to tax reform and tax on electric cars for infrastr
Protesters and healthcare critics are suckering GOP Senators. These aren't GOP voters or independents but paid hacks. Real voters are workin
Trump Jr admitted to conclusion with Russia to win the election#what are you people going to do?? Nothing#follow the Russia money to the GOP
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely! NO trumpcare or Obamacare! #FreeMarketOnly #CruzAmendment#UnitedforFreedom!
You want to keep the structure of ACA, but gut it, rename it, & call it a success. Sabotaging ACA is not leadership.
Obamacare victims= GOP bullshit.
Your scare tactics are disturbing.  Scaring people into voting for a worse plan leaving 10's of millions without healthcare is irresponsible


Our founding fathers did not compromise with Britain I do expect you to compromise on socialized healthcare. #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
@GOP  What in Gods Name are you saying you have to work with Dems on Health Care. Just REPEAL w/ MARKET SOLUTION. NOOOOO ENTITLEMENTS. GOD
Full repeel no replacemeny united for freedom
You red states sabotaged the plan in your states. Working perfect in blue states.   Your sad.
@SenMajLdr WHY R #RINOS IGNORING HIS PLEA 2 R&R #ACA IT'S CLEAR 2  U HAVE NO INTENTION 2 PASS @POTUS BILLS U ALL R A TOTAL DISGRACE!! 
Fort Worth was in Texas last time I checked, and his state rejected the subsidies. How is this the fault of the ACA?
REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE!!!!
Then maybe you should fund the way it was written and then tweak the income levels so people don't drop into holes. Just sayin'.
Then repeal this mess already.
@SenateRPC Obamacare is like having high premium auto insurance on a $20K car with a $10K deductible. Makes no sense economically
Like they say, pull yourself up by your boostraps and get better job..or pray.
#CallMe #NotAVictim
Meet me. I'm 62. One of 22M with pre-existing conditions who live in fear every day of their health care being taken away to pay back the 1%
Liar
You don't need to show us any more of this stuff, we know healthcare is broken. It's just not as broken as you jerks are.#Rhetoricrats
Single-payer system now
And your plan does not improve that for him. #tellthetruth #singlepayernow
Republicans have lied about repealing Obamacare for seven years. It's time to start replacing senators
The failure lies on the politicians that caused ACA to decline; get back to work and update ACA.  It's not partisan, it's your job.
You folks are going to be really busy lining up the  22 million victims of "healthcare choice" if your Bill passes in any form like now.
I had an individual policy with Anthem. Obama care is 150 times better coverage. Stop with the Republican lies.
" private health insurance market is imploding" WallStreetCare on the way. Who cares about the sick? Not the GOP for sure.
Would like to know how "Robert" is going to afford healthcare under Trumpcare? You won't. Better to tweak Obamacare. Trump Pride will  you

I'm self employed pay $700 a month for healthcare $8400 a year part of life , but I feel safe .
Help my son his $250 a month. Pastor how much is your insurance if less stop whining

So Republicans think he would be better without any health care at all?
Tell us how he will fare under GOP/TrumpCare Bill. Give us details. Will he even have insurance? Do you care. Using him like Trump use Women
Higher deductibles, higher co-pays and higher premiums have been an issue for years. Every year this has happened to me before ACA.
At every turn the Republicans have undermined the ACA and act as if Obama care is the issue. The larger issue never is addressed.
Senator, the problem is the Republicans failed to fund the Federal Risk Corridor which caused some companies to withdraw from the market.
How about you post stories on how your plan is better? At least President #Obama did something - now make it better and stop whining!
@realDonaldTrump Cassidy/ Collins, I like it! Get it Done!
@Senate GOP Cassidy/Collins Do it! Sounds Good, No Summer  Break, Pass it!
@Potus why OBAMACARE is stalled in the Senate?http://grandmathunder.com/2017/07/the-ogre-in-the-closet-2017/ … @GOP @SenSasse @tedcruz @senatormikelee @DrRandPaul
@SenateMajLdr @SecPriceMD repeal/replace Obamacare or begin with repeal, follow Trump's lead
You get gold plated healthcare paid for by the taxpayer, then you accept. And you get to decide on our healthcare?
C'mon Senators. Put a solid plan together and pass it. You will get hell from the media and the left no matter what.
He won't be able to afford food, if the #GOP get their bill passed. (Btw. Insurance co's set prices not our current healthcare bill)
So why didn't he just buy his own plan?  Like before? Private insurance policies are not illegal.
.@SenateGop thinks #1 problem w/ "healthcare system" is rich are paying too much in taxes.Go figure #SaveACA #TW
@senorrinhatch 

He's gonna be REALLY sad when he sees your replacement vv
So your answer is to cut his tax credits and let insurers go back to the days of lifetime limits? I'm sure that'll help...
Grow up.
Dems have come out and said they're ready to force us off the cliff into single payer. Get it done or you're accomplices.
We used the ACA during a job transition and it was affordable for us. Iron out the wrinkles of the ACA, don't support Trumpcare. #SaveACA
THEN fix the law of the land by cooperating w Democrats (as has been suggested for EIGHT YEARS)!!!
LIES
It's NOT Obamacare's fault. insurance companies have to WORK for their ungodly profits and they don't want to.
Everyone forgot how it was?
Under #trumpcare - he & his family will have no HC.  The cost is controlled by the @GOP - they are withholding Ins Exchange $$ - sabotage
Yeah but the amount we spend on the exchanges increases the deficit. Aetna alone needed a 100% increase in the amount we send to them just
To stay afloat. They only have $0.82 in short Term assets for every $1 of debt... so the increases would have to be massive to help them
Stay afloat. We wouldn't just keep taxes where they are now, we'd have to raise them, and on every tax bracket including yours, not just the
Wealthy. If you're willing to go up to a 50% rate yourself, and pay more in premiums be my guest, but that's not great for the economy
Meet everyone else at @ObamacareSavedM
Quit yapping and repeal NOW. Replace later. Much later.
A health tax  everyone covered.no more need for health  insurance. Case closed.
The problem has always been high healthcare cost, how the hell does mandating insurance fix the cost of healthcare. It doesn't, Repeal ACA
Sounds like a paid speaker. Not very convincing. He needs to work on his credibility.
Single payer for all
Without ACA we were watching our cap expenditure grow closer!  Now no cap with same doctors we've had for 17 years!
GOP needs to stop trying to kill ACA with unstable markets!
Meet me I will be unable to afford  the new hltcr VETS ELDERLY CHILDREN PREEX DISABLD AND THOSE OVER 50 will pay more-
Get a better hltcr
@KamalaHarris @SenWarren @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Only after a manipulated market caused uncertainty for Ins. Com. GOP not ACA failed.
I am a mother freelancer and couldn't afford insurance or even get it due to a pre-existing condition before Obamacare.
@GOP 
Stop campaigning !

Don't care about process!

Support our President!

Fight fake news!

American Patriotism
What crap. He lives in Texas, which did not take ACA expansion. With a health-challenged daughter, your plan will help?? That is BS.
give USA choice. take health/insurance back to the people. fedgov should get out of socialized medicine.

@HouseGOP @GOP wake up people, the republicans are no going to help you. They only protect the rich. Stand up to the GOP! #NEVERGOP
#Obamacare and the #GOP / @realDonaldTrump supporter.
And won't be able to, Under GOP-Care either.
Yet another reason for single payor
The 1% Complaining that's s laugh!
This is all you can come up with? Just one!? Bring out MORE Obamacare victims. Otherwise you're trying so hard to prove nonsense. #fakenews
It will be interesting to see how he fares when things get worse . Hopefully he doesn't need life-saving medication, ir become gravely ill.
Meet a liar who is manipulating the system
@Lawrence But what you do not say is that he found another doctor or call for assistance to find another doctor.

"DO NO HARM TO ANY AMERICAN!"
Coloradans want to keep #Medicaid funded. Let's make sure @SenCoryGardner knows he must vote #ForOurPatients! https://cards.twitter.com/cards/18ce54ddo5i/4hjeo …
They're not likely to afford insurance under #RINO Ryancare either!
#DumpPaulRyan!
Don't see how your plan helps. How does gutting Medicaid & using the money to give tax breaks to billionaires help?
Health bill is most unpopular bill in 3 decades https://www.axios.com/unpopular-health-care-bill-2454397857.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=twsocialshare&utm_campaign=organic …

No mystery why – higher costs + lower coverage = very bad combo.
Have you asked any of your friends for help?
Wow, flood the system with such one sided stories and not facts that republications never supported the ACA for 7 yrs.  what jokes you are
One more reason for REPEAL.

DO NO HARM TO ANY AMERICAN!
Breast cancer and an auto-immune disease are hard enough on Jenny. She shouldn’t have to face bankruptcy trying to save her life. 
If Republicans don't reverse Obama Care & pass laws to restrict forever enforcement of forced health care! They failed us completely!!!
Maybe if you would pay the bills the greedy ins co would stop pulling out. Do your short hair hurt?
Pol hack Schumer is using glaring unaffordability of Obamacare & claiming That will be ACA model. WHEN R U going to stop WHINING and REPEAL!
Could he afford insurance before the ACA?
We are not blind to the fact that all you do is talk about how bad the ACA is but you never really put out just how bad #trumpcare will be.
You guys caused this mess by making  it almost impossible to get O-Care. Don't shake my hand while pissing on my foot & tell me it's raining
Again, you propaganda machine is good, I'll give that to you but you are Lying and the ACTUAL INSURERS AGREE! U r sabotaging Obamacare
This is a Repost.
Republicans must feel awful about taking healthcare away from people like Robert. Skeleton policies for healthy people is not #BetterCare.
Same for us!!  Our health insurance went from $700 per month to $1200!!!  Obamacare ruined our health care system!
Obamacare saves lives.  Fix it.  #RepubicanPartyOfBigotryAndIgnorance
Looks like "Joe the plumber".  BTW, meet 22 million... http://www.npr.org/2017/06/26/534432433/gop-senate-bill-would-cut-health-care-coverage-by-22-million … Who will be screwed by the fascist GOP.
Obamacare allowed my 3 children to stay on their parents' healthcare until age 26, helping them to become educated, responsible taxpayers!
just stop the propoganda. Your poor interns are embarrassed.
AS IF IT WASN'T EVEN WORSE BEFORE
And for those of us with a pre existing condition it's been a life savor. I guess we don't count.
I'm a minister and self employed caregiver and I can afford Obamacare so I don't know what the problem is and BTW it's the ACA
Thanks to the GOP withholding promised funds to insurance companies. Stop lying to your constituents.
#Repealdontreplace 
#Freemarkethealthcare
Hand picking the minority of people who's premiums went up. Ignoring the millions now covered. Pathetic. #GOPlies
Get off your lazy buts and get it down, 7 years you have had the opportunity to have a solid plan replacement plan in place
Tired of the BS!
So many stories like this.

Single Payer Universal Coverage would solve his problem.
Lies and more lies
My daughter's family depends on Obamacare.  She has epilepsy and requires healthcare.  If you repeal Obamacare/ACA you are killing her.
Liars
Then fix ACA, rather than the death sentence insurance that you proposed. Your plan represents the decline of America & so does Trump.
because Obamacare needed tweaking which the party of no didn't fix.
Vladimir Putin says he didn't meddle in our election. The US Intelligence Community says he did. TRUMP BELIEVES PUTIN. Traitors.
Well that is a lie. Premiums is based on income. If he makes less than 30k for a family of 4 than he can get the Medicaid expansion.
I wonder how much he was paid to provide that false statement it's the ACA or death. The GOP had rather see u die than to provide it
GOP enablers to Trump's destruction of our country. http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-enablers …
Vote them out put a 2 term cap on them

PREMEDITATED MURDERERS,PUTIN 'S PUPPETS & LIARS
Insurance companies set the premiums.  Lower premiums will reduce  coverage increase deductibles/copays and out of pocket costs.
6 years of blocking improvements to the ACA from Republicans, going on 7.

#FullRepeal
REPEAL GOP !!!!  THEN REPEAL OCARE!
SIMPLY REPEAL OBAMACARE!! The government should not be involved in healthcare (healthcare for children already exists).
Good news!

With #Trumpcare no need to worry about affording it cause you can't.

But the RICH can with the #GOP Tax cuts.
#deathcare
If Americans RESEARCH they'll see the problem is LOBBYISTS!!  $$$$ to POLITICIANS!!!   #DRAINTHESWAMP
Meet Robert. An ignorant fraud 2 dense 2 realize his @GOP governor refused 2 expand Medicare & build an exchange so he would have coverage
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Another @GOP victim.
12% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE YOUR BS!! SO DHUT UP!!
the constitutions changes we dont hav the write to beleiv in god
the church asks for a dallor itz only open 1 day and thats the day .....they ask god and he aint there they do what ever they want
Enact & sign the #SinglePayer Act: problem solved.
 Insurance Lobby et alia are subservient to the  Constitution & the  People.
