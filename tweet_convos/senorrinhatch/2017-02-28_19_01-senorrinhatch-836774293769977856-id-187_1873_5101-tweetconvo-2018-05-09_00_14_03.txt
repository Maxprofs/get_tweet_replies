It's too bad the @POTUS cared so little about our kids that he was eating dinner while approving this mission that killed her husband
And Obumma never had a Soldier die while he was potus? #getalife #stopdrinkingthekoolaid
So it ok because Obama did it? I can't figure out the mentality of people with those thoughts, but DT is perfect 4 U
When you join the military you give a blank check to the USA. Not everyone who joins makes it home. Sorry to ruin your utopia.
There is an expectation the commander & chief will do everything possible to value & protect your life, if not your a fool to join
so he's supposed to say "we're not going to fight because people may die"? That's how Hitlers happen. People die in war.
Care to try again?
Your tweets are practically like word salad. I get you like DT you are like the rest of the poorly educated. Hang with them!
Yeah, sorry I don't know what the fuck I am doing and got your husband killed for nothing.
It's only right he recognizes the widow since he created the widow.
Your snark demeans you Mr.Childress.
My patriotism outranks snark. Every President lost heroes like Owens to operations. #historylesson
Don't confuse patriotism with idiocy. #historylesson
I forgive your lack of mental acuity
@Dhottman1 @POTUS God bless her deeply! May my shepherd comfort his troubled lamb!
if my husband just got killed in a ? seal operation mere 3 weeks ago..5 long mins of cheering make it ok? no
first u hastily rush a seal operation.then u drag his new widow 2 Congress & display her raw emotions on tv. 4 U

Lt OWENS should of received a PURPLE HEART last night!
Nothing like using one's loss to deflect from the decision that caused it.
The set a record part should have been left out.
3/3 lost Ryan. You all getting down and dirty only makes you look petty thin skinned and ignorant

@greggutfeld @POTUS you would have thought that they would have picked any other color but white. Subconscious at work?
Obama/Clinton staffer Dan Grilo recognizes her as "idiot". Hilarity ensues. ("Hilarity"="Grilo deleted account")
I'm with her I share her pain and grief and I'm sure millions and millions more do as well. I THANK Sr chief "Ryan Owen's ".
@greggutfeld @POTUS What a strong amazing woman
And democrats sat on their hands while the world applauded.  I hope people in their districts remember this.
@IvankaTrump Sheer agony of Carryn Owens juxtaposed to beautiful mask of @IvankaTrump.  Authentic vs ?
@OccupyBawlStree @POTUS God Bless you Carryn and your children
it looked to me like he created a spectacle out of their pain and loss. It must've been difficult for them to be there
THAT POIGNANT I COULD NOT WATCH ALL THE CLAP IT WAS SO DEEP
liberals have gone so far off the reservation they can't appreciate a wonderful moment like this w/o somehow blaming Trump
and the Dems stay seated #DemExit
Pray for this beautiful woman Mr. Trump's love of war got her husband killed
@BonBee81 @POTUS so proud and thankful that trump invited her and mrs ryan allowed us to put a face to a hero - her husband.
@debrakj @POTUS Trump doesn't give two shits about Ryan , he just blamed everyone but himself earlier when discussing his death .
@greggutfeld @POTUS what a wonderful sight to see a woman recognize her husband was a bad ass. Never been more Proud to be American!!
what about the widower?
@greggutfeld @POTUS incredible moment!!
@greggutfeld @POTUS this plus 1000000
God bless our #Heroes and a President that supports military & law enforcement and has their back @FoxNews #Military
@kailanikm Horrible for @POTUS to use her & lie about Intel as there was zero actionable Intel that will save anyones life DISGUSTING
Thank you for recognizing Ryan Owens. He embodies the United States resolve. The hope and future of freedom! #USA
Very Proud to be American!So proud of our President tonight! Gracious and moving speech!
.@cspan @BelkysSpainUSA @POTUS  lest we not forget #Hannity
Interesting that no one around her could be seen offering her any comfort.
YOU killed her husband making her a widow.
powerful.
A shame @realDonaldTrump did not take responsibility he signed the order his watch & to put her on display why do that to her
I'm honored that he's my president
I'm heartbroken for her. She is one strong woman!
sure is a lot of nerfherders  oh wait wrong chat line sorry, carry on.
We thank her for her husband service.

@Elena07617349 @POTUS: It's amazes me the ppl that never served a second can give thoughts on shit they no nothing about!Damnit man!
I'm so sorry for your loss, love and prayers to you and your family.
@LHBtampa @POTUS God bless him and his family from a great full nation 
That was an awesome moment. We will forever remember his sacrifice for our Country!
I'm not ashamed to say! I couldn't stop crying. That was a very touching and emotional moment!
you mean the women that became a widow over @POTUS not caring about intelligence briefing?!
Esa parte fué conmovedora,se ve el corazón que tiene @realDonaldTrump
@RaymondArroyo @POTUS So emotional tribute to her husband. May God give the family peace & may Ryan RIP.
God bless her and her family - and all of the families of those who serve & sacrifice.
how are you going to try and shit can that?
Owens was a member of a US unit which killed Yemeni women & children. I wonder how she feels about that.
He will always be with you and us in heart and memory.
Ivanka was so sweet to this grieving widow!
God bless you
She reminds me of Robin Wright! Kind of sexy looking! But that Ivanka-Good Lord! She looks like a Grecian Goddess
@TheSaneHomo @POTUS God bless Ms Owens. She has our prayers for Ryan!
@patrick_cassels  #faketears
@greggutfeld @POTUS America's heart breaks for your loss and America's loss.
this picture says it all about the hatred and violence that smothers this country and in the war!, so damn sad!
@steph93065 @POTUS An American hero.  Both her and her late husband.
shouldn't have invited her knowing his Dad is against speaking to Trump. They're causing conflict in a family already in pain. SHAME!
Much respect for the Owens family
Bless!!!!
She is a good military wife, and not at all like CPO Owens's father, who disrespected his son's work and legacy.
What gall. You should be ashamed of yourself, perverting the dads grief for your political tweet.
He undermined his son's life's work for his own politics: the father should feel ashamed.
You have a source for that? His son was killed in a failed mission that was unnecessary.
@greggutfeld @POTUS THANK YOU President Trump for recognizing Ryan in giving his life and honoring his wife praise the Lord
The most MOVING part of the night....GOD BLESS HER AND HER HUSBAND
bunch of ignorants comments. We chose to serve. So blame @BarackObama for all SM deaths during his Presidency. Grow up.
You don't recognize exploitation of the widow's pain for 45s ego stroking. It was disgusting
is better than saying we didn't lose anyone in Benghazi like Hillary and Obama. Recognition is not exploitation.
Recognition is a medal. Measuring applause is exploitation.
again, that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.
Others share it with me - others with insight.
well that was awkward.
God bless her 
@greggutfeld @POTUS She loves him !
@realDonaldTrump most powerful statement ever!  I even had tears in my eyes big time!  very emotional!
Well yeah, Trump caused the tragedy that has happened. Trump is trying to cover it up by honoring Ryan's widow.
@greggutfeld @POTUS disgusting leftists BO admin planned this mission and it got delayed. The haters are exploiting this politically
but who actually did it??? Doesn't that matter to you?
yes but I believe BO would have authorized if not delayed a month
The C inC who makes the decision is the one who bears the blame.
@laamigable21 @POTUS yeah media when did little o ever give respect to any of our fallen soldiers !
There is a satisfying resolution available. It's the only crime written in the Constitution.
@rebeccagberg @POTUS Bless her and curse 45
-The raid was Trump's fault. Trump made the call. Pathetic.
Her husband truly was a hero, and we grieve for her and her family. Pardon me if I disapprove of using his death for politics.
thank you
@greggutfeld @POTUS Amen.
You should because you made her a widow!
This is why we stand for our flag and national anthem.  Thank you for your service and bless you Carryn.
@greggutfeld @POTUS Prayers to Carryn Owens and family.
Navy Seal Ryan Will Never Be Forgotten.
selfish, exploiting, he doesn't understand so much.
a true hero as is his wife!
@greggutfeld @POTUS God bless her and comfort her and all of her family and friends.
Chickenhawk @POTUS blames death of Seal on the Generals, Admirals, and Military.
@greggutfeld @POTUS We shold all pray to never know the loss she has. I hope she finds peace in knowing his life and death mattered.
@realDonaldTrump Tortured forgotten Veteran @WtrGpsy receive #Justice #Mindy #veterans Deserve PrivatizedCare #JointSession
@carynowens62 is this ur Twitter account? If so, why r u pretending that @RealDonaldTrump didn't actually murder your husband?
My heart breaks for this  beautiful woman 
just seeing this woman's pain makes me mad at our @potus . This did not have to happen. Ordered just for a presidential macho show
something likes this takes months of planning and it was approved by the Obama administration.
Wrong.  It was approved by Trump.
Can't believe they used her like that. Wonder what her father in law thinks.
He might not have died if #45 had actually had recent Intel and really understood the risks versus the benefits.
he might not have died if #44 had done his job to begin with.
bullshit, Owens was fodder for Trump's ego.
God bless
@greggutfeld @POTUS the best of the best.
@RealDonaldTrump killed him. Murderer. Why can't the police press charges for manslaughter? @RealDonaldTrump
God bless you Carren.  America has not abandoned you
@greggutfeld @POTUS High point of tonight's address, by far!
@carolynsbuddy @POTUS Horrible to exploit this woman for political gain. Just awful.
she's not the only wife to lose her husband or wife who serve to protect our country.
@greggutfeld @POTUS America LOVES Mrs. Owens!
@greggutfeld @POTUS She is supporting our President!  God bless her & her family today & everyday!
God bless the widows and children of our military!
God bless the family of SC Owens
What a beautiful woman.
#yemengate

Did...did Trump just say a slain Navy SEAL is looking down happily from heaven because his mention broke an applause record?
@greggutfeld @POTUS  She's as tough as a Navy Seal. God bless her and bring peace to her.
of course the Dems shit all over that one, similar to what they do with everything. #Jointsession
What about the many that died or maimed by the war we didn't win... and peeOTUS was against day one. ? Vietnam deferment!
(?)
I can't imagine her heartbreak in losing her son .. bless her and her family
@greggutfeld @POTUS  That brought tears for her
until someone again questions the results, then he will blame generals like he did this a.m. on Fox
That poor family. He hurt that poor woman. #ShutUpAlreadyDonny
No Trump didnt applauded that long for a f****** record!
@greggutfeld @POTUS Veteran s and active duty.. Present...Arms!
@michaeldweiss @POTUS great respect to her husband's parents...unreal
@greggutfeld @POTUS 
@greggutfeld @POTUS this was beautiful
Perhaps the most disgraceful thing he has done thus far was to blame military for botched raid.
That young man died, Traitor Trump is lying.  They got shit.
A-hole
DJT and his sad band of billionaires combined  not worth loss of this brave man.
. God bless Mrs. Owens & all brave families.  Thank you.
she should have thrown an orange at that creep @realDonaldTrump Sick of #warProfiteers
TRUMP CAN PAY OFF OUR Debts completely by getting the WORLD TO PAY US FOR PROTECTION
@PoppyLane_ @POTUS good man. Good lady. Cheers
Added prayers for Mrs Owens for strength....

did NOT recognize the tragedy and responsibility for it. The buck doesn't stop here. Sickening.
u must not have listened to the speech. Just spewing hate.
@sistertoldjah @POTUS Trump could care less.  Geez
could you imagine if Obama had did this
omg. Obama could never have pulled this shit show off
@MelissaAFrancis @POTUS God bless her
That he got killed. He's a POS, not the POTUS!
Amazing strength! God bless her!! 
We love our military and veterans!
I'm stunned she'd attend
she got her moment of fame bc of her husband
She came to honor her husband - it was about him, not her. Brave, loving thing to do. @tweetybirdkarin @MsKadyClark @cspan
agree but Trump has no such feeling about her-she's a prop to him. maybe she voted for him & doesn't care
Recgnizes?  You mean "exploits".
attention to widow and lost SEAL is fine. Smiling about record for standing ovation was disrespectful. IMO TYFYServc
didn't @POTUS deny responsibility and blame his generals? She allows the same man to use her as a prop. Sad!
very but people are so gullible
I caught @MSNBC telling us the mission was in vain, wishful thinking on their part I'm sure......pigs.
GTFOH!
cried my eyes out... God bless her
shameful exploitation.  Ask Ryan's dad why he's not there.
as opposed to no recognition by Obama? You should be ashamed of yourself and obsession with identity politics
Mrs Owen is a hero also.  for her.
meanwhile...
In an interview that aired earlier today, Trump passed blame for Yemen raid to his generals: "They lost Ryan" http://wapo.st/2mqXdnm 
hater of america
An American hero that Trump is now using to make himself look good. Trump's a sick man.
