Harvard research estimates an incremental 17,000-27,000 deaths with this bill. http://ampr.gs/2s2JhCY  Safety Net?
I Lost my Insurance because of obama, he Lied 
ACA needs to be amended. Taking 23 million more off insurance is not the answer. Goal should be better coverage for MORE Americans.
It's not 23M that number is Shrinking! It's Not Affordable! Obama Lied 
We'll see when new CBO score comes out. Trump promised not to cut Medicaid, Medicare, SS, and would negotiate drug prices down.
Obamacare was a Lie and Failure! Democrats are Paying the Price for that! We Need a Safety Net to Help People, Not dependency.Elderly HELP
Yes we do. The AHCA is not a safety net. Here is an unbiased article about who is helped and hurt by Senate bill.
Here is NPR's unbiased CEO
These are the GOP senators recently paid by Pharma and Insurance cos. to write this bill.
Why didn't u list the democrats that do the same?
Because I'm referring to this Senate bill. They have yet to be involved in well - anything in this bill.
ALL these politicians have their pockets being filled by ALL these special interests groups. Most pay BOTH sides.
Nice deflection. But right now republicans are the ones passing health care legislation. So they get the scrutiny
That's how u people r. But the reality is they are all getting paid. No one over the other.
Here are the professional healthcare orgs. strongly opposed to this bill because of their oath. "First do no harm."
Healthcare Bill MUST allow ppl 2 buy  insur across state lines creating competn tht MadeAmericaGreat & will keep Making America Great #MAGA
YOU GUYS NEED TO PASS POTUS TRUMPS AGENDA AND FAST OR YOU WILL BE REPLACED ELECTION TIME,YOU HAVE ALL THE POWER SO USE IT IF YOU PASS POTUS
it provides a BIG TAX CUT for wealthy people they don't need and NO SAFETY NET for those that need one

You're already kicking millions off of health insurance. Why must you add insult to injury by lying to us?
@senatemajleader Every great country in the world has healthcare. So many examples, 7 years later, and this is your plan. #FAILEDLEGACY
You are playing w American lives, slow this down, cut the rich tax breaks. 8 years to come up with something. This NOT IT.  STOP
Then release ENTIRE proposed bill, with cost analysis & CBO report & let citizens decide. This trust us we know what we're doing is garbage
@senorrinhatch This is a fact-free take on the issue completely disproven by the CBO today.
What horseshit.
Why are Americans fixated on helping the Insurance Industry, rather than on HEALTH and getting Monsanto out of the FDA?

Finish up without JULY 4 VACATION what you promised us for the last 7 years.  REPEAL & REPLCE Obamacare.  NOT Obamacare light.
"Hill-Burton Act" created best H/C system in world for 70 yrs.requiring % of fed subsidy to pay for needy-poor Time to RESTORE what WORKS
TRUMPS AGENDA WE CAN MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND YOU GUYS WILL NEVER LOSE AGAIN.
We won't stand for the indecency, the lies, the crap "policy" of this bill, or further hideous tries at HC by GOP. Drop the bill.Get a soul.
We WILL NOT stand for this bill. WILL. NOT. GOP is clearly incapable of decent HC bill. So, help Ds improve ACA or leave HC alone entirely.
Stop rushing this.  It needs debate BY AMERICAN PEOPLE.  Want it passed? Take out rich tax breaks.
This safety net must have eyes that only catch the rich and let the poor fall through.
Real people know Repeal won't cause deaths, but if a repeal is not in the works many will no longer be in Senate
At a time when economic change is making life more difficult for all but the rich, denying people to access health insurance is just wrong.
When the#Galen institute outweighs every other reputable public health and medical group, I'll listen
bahaahhahahhaha this is funny
Taking 181 Thousand Vietnam Veterans Off Disabled will end up in 181 Thousand Suicides  COMBAT Veterans Know Republicans Hate them
@SenateMajLdr @sendavidperdue GOP senators unite pass AHCA & tax reform , Americans support President Trump
This opinion piece is pure bunk pushed by a GOP shill. Vote NO on the bill designed to kill Americans.
The Senate Health Bill Provides little to no health care for most people & tax cuts for rich people. So it sucks more than the last gop one.
The safety net is tax cuts for rich people & the "needed" reforms either kill people,  deny care or price folks out of the healthcare market
Country over party, what a mean spirited group of paid off tools.
#killthebill we are not fools
I don't understand the need to rush! Take time to get it RIGHT! Don't repeat what the Dems did with the ACA! Work with them! Medicare 4 all!
By safety net do you mean black hole of healthcare debt for the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions?
PLEASE DON'T RUSH THIS BILL, IT NEEDS MORE REVIEW. Don't leave and hope more work gets done on it later. Stand up and do your work. THINK
Be decent people, not politicians.  If you have  the ability to be compassionate, honest and kind, vote no. Put people, not party, first.
GOP lied about ACA for years & now want America to accept a TERRIBLE AHCA plan.....they must be REMOVED from govt 11.6.2018.
Get your asses on board or get out of office. We will vote u out if u vote no.
How is tax breaks to the rich, increased taxes cost for low & middle income and 23 million losing #healthcare an improvement? #LiarLiar
No vote. No recess.
Repeal oba ma care
TrumpCare rates will go up too, elderly pay 5 times more, cheats poor, disabled, lower class, kids, pretty much  everyone but rich people.
No it doesn't,  who are you kidding? Disabled in wheelchairs get carted off  by police outside McConnell's office? R U KIDDING??
Since when have Republicans ever been for a safety net.  You all are such liars.
Nothing that even looks like a tax cut for the wealthy will get passed. It's the unfortunate truth. Just subtract the tax cut and it's good
If you happen to make/have > $250,000 annually, like perhaps working for Bigly-Pharma, or a de-fence contractor. Otherwise..., yer screwed.
Liars.

Republican:  If he can't pull his weight, throw him under the bus
Democrat:  He ain't heavy, he's my brother
Who's paying you off for $1T in tax cuts for the 1% you grifting GOP shitheads?
@realDonaldTrump consider future @realdonaldtrump. Save yourself future tweet embarassement: surreptitious and clandestine. Ctrl V, Ctrl P.
I don't believe Senators that go back and forth and say we can pass health care and then take their answer back.
Senator Pat Toomey's phone is all messed up trying to keep voters like me from leaving a message to pass this bill.
You guys are definitely stonewalling.
Way to work against America's real enemies; #seniors, #kids and the #poor. @AARP
@realDonaldTrump  Repeal 100%  add regs for preexist conds. States can take care of their uninsured. Grow a pair @SenateGOP!
Right
A safety net? If you're referring to the safety net the 0.1% WEALTHIEST Americans will receive EVERY SINGLE YEAR, that's true!
Medicare for all would create small monthly premium, good coverage & no medical debt for people. It would free employers from HC costs. Win!
Do not re elect anyone who supports this bill and votes yes!
You first. You have that insurance and let us know how it turns out.
US Bishops: "Most troubling are unacceptable changes to Medicaid that...will leave millions of...people uninsured."
Obviously the Senate @GOP can't get their shit together. I hope @realDonaldTrump breaks the GOP Senate up since you're no better than Dems.
No, it doesn't.  #sad #HellerVoteNO
This health plan is barbaric! Guess you will all be having parties and clapping as people die, one by one every day! Repub= death!
Your party is developing a Stalinesque approach to the American people.
Vote republicans, ALL of them, out of office in Nov. 2018. Vote like your life depends on it - it does.
Why do large tax cuts for the wealthy, instead of the working poor, appeal to you?  Money is fine; but greed is ungodly.
It does not. States will be able to put caps on the care of the ill and disabled, and countless will suffer.
If you guys pass this bill be prepared for repealing and replacing each & every one of you. #keepyourhandsoffmyhealthcare
Get this passed no free ride bring back healthcare INS sucks 50 states voted this agenda wake up Dems & repubs America is watching!
Does this bill cover treatment for compulsive lying? #youbreakityoubuyit
What bullshit is this? If you're below 150% of the poverty line, your deductible increases from an average of $255 to $6000.
This is a safety net in the same way that a bear trap under a trapeze artist is a safety net.

(In other words, that's not a safety net.)
What a load of garbage. It's a tax cut for millionaires that will leave millions without healthcare. #NoAHCA
Why were no women included in the writing of this horrible proposal??
Lies on top of lies
Senate health bill provides safety net for the wealthiest
AARP and leading hospitals do not agree with you.
Your slogan should be "Let them eat cake" #ACHA #BCRA #TrumpDeathcare #SaveACA #SaveMedicaid
Really?!

No it does not. Tax breaks vs healthcare? It's a taking away if not now, down the road
Read it.. NOT GOOD you need to ditch this and start over! #SinglePayerNow
There is no safety net, you're sentencing 23 million Americans to death. Shame! #TrumpDeathcare #Liars #ACHA #BananaRepublicGOP #GOP #MAGA
Robin if there was a god you would have been struck down! We all know Ins. Co. wrote Obama care. repeal Ins. Co. Obama Care
So your touting a a anti-aca writer to make your case? Genius. The only safety net is tax breaks for the wealthy to keep your jobs. Criminal
The typical ACA enrollee has an income of $40,000 for a family of 4. Other enrollees R strong partisans & "vote straight-ticket Republican."
this woman is a pundit, not a journalist. Writes anti obamacare crap for a living. shame on forbes, need objective data not propoganda
Americans will see the truth after years of conning them w your lies.The rich live,poor,sick seniors die
@SenateMajLdr WOW, America First Politics attacking Sen Heller for his NO vote. attacking your own. EVIL
finally our nation's wealthiest have their very own safety net!
Ditto Doucheous
Remember Watergate when 40 indicted and served prison terms. @JohnCornyn So 1-19-17 CNN live 45 stated he gave U a lot of $ & get to work.
Is it true this bill will FORCE 441,000 elderly verterans off Medicare and BACK into the hands of the VA so they can be ignored and killed?
Safety net?  U mean 4 the rich? The redistribution of wealth to help them feel safer?  Becaus they don't have enough? Poor get poorer & die
What a bucket of !
More GOP lies & greed. Trumpcare CUTS safety net to shreds. Forbes & GOP like it bc rich & corps get $650B tax cut. No true healthcare here.
Bull  more GOP propaganda lies for political greed
The Dems need to go into DT territory & hold town hall meetings to explain the affects of HC bill on them personally.Not sure theyunderstand
Don't believe Trump has read/understands what's in the HC bill. 
For the rich, very rich and wealthy.  @gop has taken us into a kleptocracy, we are on our way to oligarchy and dictatorship.
A safety net? A SAFETY NET?!?!? How the HELL is millions of people losing healthcare a "safety net"?!?!? 
Think how much more you'd save if you kept the taxes for RICH people! I'm flabbergasted that you have a justification for hurting the poor!
Then why isn't Congress going on the AHCA Plan, but staying on ACA. If AHCA is so good, you also need to be on it & worry about preexisting
GOP is majority...use your skills at representing America to find out who is behind laws that make it harder to vote
99 bills have been introduced in 31 states in 2017 to make it harder to vote https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voting-laws-roundup-2017 â€¦ 
Gerrymandering is the number one issue for unfair elections. GOP have redistricted to the point of the ridicules.
"Senate Health Bill Provides *No* Safety Net And *Needs* Reforms" I fixed the typos for you.
It cuts Medicaid significantly, stops funding for Planned Parenthood, increases deductibles, gives tax breaks to the rich and   hurts sick.
Pathetic no fact just talking point article author bio: President of the Galen Institute, & co-author of Why ObamaCare Is Wrong for America
Really?
Your entire administration and thus party platform sits on a throne of lies.
Opinion: We catalogued nearly every outright lie Donald Trump has told publicly since taking the oath of office http://nyti.ms/2t4xjJe 
The only "reforms" in the bill are a tax cut for the GOP's wealthy donor base. You're not fooling anyone.
#tcot #tlot #teaparty @FriscoTeaParty @MarkDavis @marklevinshow U idiots need 2 get off the dope & REPEALS IT, THIS DISASTOR, can't be fixed
Nothing says reform like a tax credit to those making over $250k. The @GOP greed knows no bounds!
Trying quoting from the bill
It provides huge tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn't help the rest of America... what else do we need to know?!
First of all as a country we should not be in the insurance business period. You pay for it
Agreed.  Why should Govt take $ from one to pay for another's healthcare?
You guys said you would repeal and replace, this effort is neither. #healthcare  #Republicans
Senate health bill kills Medicaid Expansion. Kills care for Veterans Women & Children. That's not the American way. NO. #HealtCareBill 
Senate Health Bill will Be a Death Sentence for Many American's. Call Now!#trumpcarekills
