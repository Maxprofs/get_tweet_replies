@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch When are you going to call out Warren for lies?
what lies?
How about being of Indian decent? AG is a Racist? List too long for tweet. Inuindo=lie
I don't even know what you are referring to )
She is a disgrace Speak the truth.She violated Senate rules and tried to smear him. Unbecoming.Childish.Vindictive.
check this out
Typical retort for losing argument. Not angry. Stating facts. You disputed my statement. Fact are not anger.
Time to drain the swamp!
You live in #DC in a lovely #Bubble.It's time u woke up to what working citizens are trying to do!
There's an inverse relationship between the duration of his service and the IQ of the GOP voter base.

@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch length of service does not denote quality as we see throughout the government sir
He's no #Hero!  Try supporting a family in private sector while you guys screw us all with regs, taxes!!!
you mean in the lowest rated congress in the history of the country?
Time to retire. We know who's running for reelection. We said #nodevos. You didn't listen.
Just one more reason he should pack his bag and go. We need new blood to change this country. Not more of you.
Frankly, you #electedElites make me sick..You luv your #Bubble and care nothing abt real people!
This is why US needs term limits for the Senate & House. You 2 need to do your jobs or resign.  Obstructionists
he will be replaced next year, you don't listen to your constituents we wil find someone who will
Being "longest serving" is not an award...What has he done for his constituents?  Tell us.....
Obstructionist to the end.
all those years of leading the country backwards, is that anything to be proud of?
Time for term limits. The country has suffered far too long with this dinosaur. Kick out the old boys club!
Which is exactly why there should be term limits!!
...probably can remember better days then
yeah thats not a "Good Thing" you old bags need to go!!   #TermLimits
Being a #LifetimeSenator is nothing compared to trying to hold your job in private sector for a lifetime.
So we voters know he's going to retire with the perks/pension of a #GovernmentWorker.What abt his voters perks
@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch He is a CLOWN??
@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch STOP the LIES and BULLSHIT  we need IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS NOW
Hatch is s backwards baboon who tries to impose his laughably absurd religious beliefs upon all of us.
Mitch, thanks for expelling CO2 when you exhale. Plants need it for photosynthesis. That's all you're good for.
What would you know about being kind and gracious?
..return the money to Soros.
funny because when he first ran it was on the platform that Senators shouldn't be career politicians...
Y'all need to go. #resist
Being a career politician is not a badge of honor you spineless political hack
And just like yourself, he needs to go! mmm....must talk to my relatives in KY and the people in Utah!
No Dem could unseat @SenOrrinHatch but collusion w/ @realDonaldTrump, the so-called Republican, will end many @GOP careers.
seriously, you are a traitor.
How can you ignore/dismiss Bannon/Trump's lies and dissolution of our democracy in good conscience??
Too bad he hasn't stood up for America since January 20th. Goodbye legacy. #spineless
you can hold hands on your way out.after your stripped of your benifits#crook
That's true but then your both GOP. In the end you will be remove.@womensmarch A Day without Women coming.

Term limits dude
When are you going to show some leadership and start challenging Trump? You are losing whatever credibility you have left.
and precisely why we need term limits
That alone ought to tell you something, Mitch. Christ. He's older than you are. And twice as incompetent
@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch well isn't up in #2018? Will he runs again?
Which is a problem.  You guys are all bought and need term limits.
And just like you, corrupt as the day is long and morally bankrupt.
#termlimitsplease
That's the WHOLE prob in WA! Too many WA thugs making a CAREER of the office! RINOS are no diff than libtards!!
@POTUS had every right by the Constitution and Laws to write the EO banning ppl from the US. Get Gorsuch in now
Ok Guys; use Nuclear to put in Gorsuch now. He's needed on SC seat! Left taking away powers of POTUS!
Senator Hatch is a statesman & a leader. The remainder of the Senate should use him as a role model.
Some of you people have been there TOO LONG!
another great reason for term limits!!
I'd say it's about time
for @SenOrrinHatch to go, were it not
time for all GOP "see-no-evil"
Donald Trump boot lickers to go.
hence, time to go.
I'm tired of watching him blow his nose behind You on tv. GOP disgraceful.
That's part of the problem...it's time for term limits #TermLimits
Mitch and Oran shame on your comramizing the constitution for political power.
term limits. No senator should hold office for more than 2, 3 max, terms.
And that is what is wrong with our Congress. Term limits now. Time for u dinosaurs to be put out to pasture.
#termlimits
and a valid argument for term limits. He has lost his constituents in UT
this is why we need caps on how long senators and congressmen can serve
that just sucks.. term limits.  Go home rubberneck

Scumbags:
You're joking right? 
.@SenOrrinHatch is a corrupt, racist, hypocrite & .@SenateMajLdr You are an evil, sad excuse 4 a man
.For his shameful statement against the Gold Star family MCCain must apologize.
now we can focus on term limits to let you two gracefully retire.
One hypocrite, corrupt politician extoling the virtues of another hypocrite, corrupt politician.
Orin Hatch is the worst Senator this country has ever endured. He's full of hate, contrary to your praise.
Perfect example of why we need term limits.
Coming from U that means he's a total dick.
Tell Trump to release his tax returns.
admire him and you for standing up for the dignity & respect our nominees are owed from the governing body. Txs
he did a great job in finance hearing!
then it's time to kick him out. ;He's just as worthless as minnie mitch and all the other lapdogs
Herpes lasts forever too...doesn't mean you want it hanging around #swampsenate #swampcabinet
that should not be allowable.
You are both embarrassments to our society and justify the enactment of term limits.
unfortunately nobody will ever say something this nice about you McConnell.
Thanks for the reminder. Time for a changing of the guard in Utah!
#termlimits. 2 prime examples.
That's NOT a good thing...life long #MOC. We need TERM LIMITS now!  @SenateMajLdr shld be the 1st go GO!
Turtle say what? And that is part of the problem.... Career politicians!
Both of u old farts need 2retire. Time 4 some young blood w/modern-time ideas to take over. Need term limits.
you all are part of the problem not the solution
#TermLimits congressional service was not meant to be a career
and further proof why there should be term limits for Congress like their is for the Presidency. #TheResistance
good point, we need term limits on government service just like those for president only better. #termlimits
Where are the investigations into Russia's involvement in our election? Had Hillary won you'd be on #4 by now
all the more reason u n him need to go home
He might be a nice guy, but we do not want career politicians they do not serve us well.
it's probably time for him to go then
A most honorable man.
you're a human wet nap
@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch Time to retire ole Mitch. You have out lived your usefulness to our country.
Sir:We the People note the GOP is ignoring presidential usurpation and is guilty of dereliction of constitutional duty.
cool. So what's going on with #russianhacking or the #NaziOnTheNSC ?
and the perfect poster child for term limits. Party politics as usual in Washington.
he is a greedy self interested golden swamp member who doesn't want FDA regulations on supplements to profit
With all due respect, .@SenateMajLdr Utah's .@SenOrrinHatch unkindly fails to represent a sizeable minority (a third) of his constituents.
True #alternativefacts: the "orrin hatch" is teen slang for the #asshole. @SenateMajLdr @SenOrrinHatch
You can learn courage from Sen. Hatch. He went around the cry baby dems. Do the same thing.
I agree. Being from Utah, I'm disappointed by all of the negative comments being thrown around
sadly a milestone @SenateMajLdr will be denied by voters.
so it's time for him to retire.
you guys have been in the Senate  WAY TOO LONG.  It's time for TERM LIMITS & FRESH 
Your lips tired yet?
NEED Term Limits NOW
SWAMP!
And Sen McConnell YOU ARE NOT!
the both of you are a fine example of why we need term limits. Not just Republicans either.
Don't Care
Has he gotten a hold of his bigotry and racism ?
Utah has net changed since 1960!
too long.. #DRAINTHESWAMP
Smart, bec he used Parlim'y procedr 2 push 2 cabt nom'ees out of com'tee past obstrn't Dimms & 2 flr of Senate!
after today health care gets to be aware
Time for him to retire
maybe it's time for him to rest and retire. Plus you look tired to
Perhaps they can share a cottage by the sea!
Mr turtle, ha, ha, ha.
@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch 
time to retire all you all farts
I've always admired his demeanor. He is a true Senator in every sense of the word.
You need to confirm Gorsuch
TERM LIMITS!  TERM LIMITS!
A lot stronger than your weak ass, Mitch
Senators should not be allowed to serve longer than 12 years. #TermLimits
Why do you hate women? Why do you support racism?
Were you gracious to Senator Warren? GOP has lost all credibility, integrity.. voters watching
Tragic that he will end his career on this dark note. Serving a fascist and shredding constitution. Tragic.
all together #hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite hypocrite
Wow. Public seems to hate both of you. Strange form of "public service."
That's not a good thing! The Congress needs new blood. #draintheswamp
time for some new blood I'd say .  As a woman I mean that's my feeling
It's time for both of you to leave office. You suck.
#corrupt #sexist #racist
@SenateGOP @SenOrrinHatch FYI,not a positive point when we ALL support #TermLimits  how tone deaf you are! #DrainTheSwamp
all the more reason old men like you and him need to GO You're out of touch and you're  CORRUPT  #resist
Are you endorsing term and age limits now because that's really what needs to happen?
Hatch backs President Trump more then you do. Either get on bo
enough with the brainwashing. When will we have better healthcare? #DrainTheSwamp
time to #draintheswap
then it is time he should retire and live on that great senate pension that us taxpayers give you bums.
You're a good guy too Mitch.
