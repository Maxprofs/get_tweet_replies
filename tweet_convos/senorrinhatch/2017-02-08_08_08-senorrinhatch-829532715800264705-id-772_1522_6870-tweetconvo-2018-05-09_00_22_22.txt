Yeah, the DEMOCRATS WILL NOT GIVE UP.  WE WILL PERSIST.  WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CAN'T EVEN READ. WTF?
yep your base doesn't know who is president, is it Bush 41 or 43  LOSERS!!!
PRESIDENT ILLITERATE.  THAT'S WHO IS PRESIDENT.  COMPLETE AND TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT.
Yeah, an Illiterate "10 time Billionaire!" You're embarrassing yourself.
BILLIONAIRE - SPELLS CORRUPTION, FRAUD, AND ROBBING THE TAXPAYER BLIND.
As a former Democratic idiots like you are why people like me hv left the party
Democrats have no one to blame but themselves but they're too blind to see that.
the mid term elections will be great more Democrats will loose seats in Congress we will have a large
large egg?? And we will be taken back to the age where we were cave people
what reality do you live in. I see the reality around me everyday
I am going to bet urban under 30 and problems still off mom and dad or welfare
nope wrong, home owner with a good career and a truck. Not on welfare with good relationship
well you can't know much because you back democrats
really? Assuming again. Read the news from real sources on both sides to see the story.
you're underestimating why Dems are upset with Trump - he's a con and you've been conned too.
democrats oppose for the sake of opposing, forget what's good for the country
Dems really need to grow up and work w/the elected Pres. They're not being fair to their constituents.
Democrats have proven themselves as violent and hateful losers!! I'm a registered democrat.not for long
WRONG, LADY.  WE ARE WORRIED FOR THE COUNTRY.
wrong. Your ideas and hatred are bad for this country. Leave the dark side
Wait.. What?!  I have hatred for no one.  I will speak up for injustice.
they are beyond derogatory description
I hope the run her again and again.
no they have just been doing what the GOP has been doing the past 8 years. Did you think about that? Very short minded
Hmmm, I don't remember seeing any GOP folks wearing vagina hats???  Must have missed that on CNN
and that's all you took away from the successful women's march? #biggercrowd #moresubstance
Successful??? Pathetic more like it.
It was more like women having a party than a women's march.
Not bitter about her loss. Pissed there's a huge orange racists running $hit now. We need @MittRomney
I'm over the loss, I'm not over the @GOP running right over what the majority of the country wants.
Majority won dumdum
Dems and liberals always thinking they are the majority.
he's referring to the popular vote.
Wow, thank you for clarifying that. Again led to believe pop vote matters.
it's not the law, but it shows there is a deep divide that shouldn't be ignored.
you think the pop vote is dividing the country?
no, it SHOWS the divide in our country. I think you know that. :)
It's just not the Dems! I am ashamed to be a Republican!  Not the party of Lincoln anymore! Sadly!
So why was the Republican Party so bitter back in 08' & 2012? And why was it okay then? "Hypocrisy"
republicans didn't act like cry baby fools back then. Grow up
Either you have a short memory or you simply don't care. Either way, don't be a cry baby over opposition. "Resistance"
Did they have a protest every other day?
Everyday! You don't remember all the monkey signs & go back to Africa or Not My President? C'MON MAN!
it's not ok to call fellow senators racists. It's not ok to break the law. I support her censure.
if I'm not mistaken, it wasn't her that called him that.
That is the whole point of her speech. Sessions is going to discriminate, blah, blah.
he has a record going back 30 years of this. I think she has a valid point.
not according to people he worked with, worked for, convicted and shut down KKK in state
I think Senator Franken address the fallacy of this claim.
You really think Al Franken has any credibility? Have you read his book? Goofy
he got elected to the senate. I suspect he has more credibility than you.
Warren should just shut up, she is just a big mouth!!
Agreed. If he did nothing, he'd be labeled as do nothing. He does something, he's a dictator. Idiots.
he is a dictator who does nothing but cry on twitter when his wife's products are not selling
That's so stupid Webster's is looking for a new word for it.
a word for trump being a dictator and do nothing, maybe Hitler. He had the SS do his work
hateful not bitter !
Senator Warren had a RIGHT TO SPEAK to present her agenda or rebuttal. Smh unfair what was done 2 her!
get over it!
VERY bitter indeed!
Way to go, Senator Hatch! There is a Time and Place for everything! Senator Warren was 
 out of line.
Wrong!! We are terrified of what you're doing to this country and its people. Trump is a narcissist.
#to bad isn't it.
@FosterF31757930 @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton  This isn't about HRC!! This is about an Orwellian, Authoritarian Threat to Democracy
It's not the loss of Hillary Clinton it is the way #45 and the rest of you republicans are destroying this country
To say King's letter is not true is denial of truth!  Shame on you!
Elizabeth Warren is a hero! She is trying to save Civil Rights won with great difficulty
shut up
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton You have not listened to the American people#dumpdevos Wholly unqualified.
and R's were out of line to not advise and consent Merrick Garland.
enough with the brainwashing. When will we have better healthcare? #DraintheSwamp
won the pop vote. Over it. System flawed. Upset over racist/ unqualified appointees of GOP.
Democrats pull up your big boy panties & do your job.Election over and results are NOT going to change.
Not bitter about loss..that happens. Shocked that so many cld vote 4 an incompetent bigoted child.
, we are worried because there is a crazy man in the White House.

the demons lost they heard God in the white house and can't take they are burning all over piss on them
It's called immaturity....
Warren  1st ammendment  rights was violated FREEDOM OF SPEECH  it's not called your way or the highway
grow up- he won, deal with it.
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton So sucking it up, buttercup. /2x
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton You spent 8 yrs not getting over President Obama's victory, & Bill Clinton's. /1
.@FoxNews @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton all their kicking & screaming will PAYOFF YUGE! for Republicans/TRUMP in 2018 Primaries. DUMB DEMS
the more democrats (senators) do what they're doing in congress the more voters see t babie
the imploding DEMS, 1 year b4 primaries, is GOLD for Republicans, TRUMP Presidency
@karmasenz @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton democrats are clearly being obstructionists. They shall be more defeats for them in 2018
abd bitter about how trump is messing up the good country.
Orrin Hatch is always soft spoken and gentlemanly.  So his comments herein are absolutely true.
No they are seeing Trump lose his mind he is unbalanced!!!!
The Democrats are for women, want 1st woman president. HRC lost and now trying to hurt Trump women!!
Women are watching you and we see you and we remember. #Neverthelessshepersisted
BITTER??? I call it down right crazy hatred...damn, they have become loony toons. It is so embarrassing
No we are upset over the hatred, bigotry and disrespect for citizens and the Constitution that's come
Yes, they are slowing the POTUS cabinet picks and policy changes just to complain and whine.
Democrats better get used to the idea that the country voted Republican for Pres. and the Legislature
The Democrats support communism, not America!
ya we know
It amazes me that Dems are willing to follow HRC down the rathole.
democrats are bitter people in general
true
One of my favorite Congressman.
How long can being bitter last? Grow up Dems. Our country comes first. Get on with meaningful business
just like the GOP were way out of line when  President Obama won twice
kinda like how the #GOP was bitter after losing to Obama twice?
If they are bitter that's their problem, not American people's.  They must not obfuscate people's work.
We have a Hitler in WH.... Dems are mmnot bitter... Horrified...,as REST of world is
Americans had to deal with Republican obstruction for 8 years. Now, you will deal with it for 4 years.
they will never get over it
You have become an embarrassment to Utah! Your behavior for the last 8 years is shameful
SHOWING STRENGTH. DELIBERATE STRATEGY. STAND UP 2 TRUMP & EMPHASIZE REPUBLICAN WEAKNESS, FEAR & FAILURE
DJT DOESNT HAVE A BLANK CHECK TO DO OR SAY ANYTHING. BE A TRUE CONSERVATIVE! HOLD GOVT ACCOUNTABLE!
Sorry, Trumpkins. No matter how you slice it, Donald Trump is a disgraceful human and president. #Truth
OK what do you have to say about @realDonaldTrump .  You know the guy who lies.
Somehow he projects denial the wrong way.  Is he aware of that guy in the Oval Office?
Time to get over it. We sucked it up for 8 long years.
@hipweenet
hit it on the spot sir. You're absolutely correct!!
This is not about C.  GOP are evil, racist, sexist, on the take, immoral bastards.  Vote out 2018
nope nope nope. Dems are worried abt a racist being the AG. Because civil rights are a thing. #KKKAG

Did you know @SenOrrinHatch & @RepKevinBrady can see & release Trump taxes any time? 

But they won't b/c they know it'll show Russian $$. â€¦
Amazing Dems are comfortable obstructing making US less safe by not giving presT his cabinet.Shame dems
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch let the people of Utah down, You will be replaced next eletion for your betrayal
America keep standing. Keep standing!
again  we the people voted in Trump because we are tired of people like this full of hate.time /change
Democrats are in a perpetual meltdown. They just won't allow themselves to believe in reality.
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton enjoy hatch while you can. When 2018 comes, you're out! Anyone right now would be better
Let me rephrase this: the American people are horrified by what this administration is doing to this country
@Joeman_c @truebluebyu my man still has it!
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton I don't think the Democrats have behaved any differently than the Republicans.
Hatch is an embarrassment to Utah. Old, senile, angry, and completely out of touch.
Orrin time for bed and then check into the home.
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton they are not out of line they are doing their jobs unlike the GOP who didn't
@SenOrrinHatch  Both sides just wish she'd lost to an actual Republican.  Or that actual Rs would call this joker out.
We may be bitter but we are not way out of line.
, u r pathetic. It's not abt a loss, it's abt a racist, misogynistic, narcissist who cares only 4 himself
at least those representatives are listening to their constituents. @SenOrrinHatch has been wildly out of touch with his this year.
@SenOrrinHatch Hatch represents a state where the majority of voters did not choose Trump. His support of Trump is shameful.
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton We are more angry about your childish behavior towards Merrick Garland. #Hypocrite
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton well she was competent and DJT is proving himself a dangerous fool. #sexism
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton language like "out of line" smack of fascism
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton liar....you are only getting what YOUR party set as president
the whole world could figure that one out
@SenOrrinHatch @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton Repubs were bitter for 8 years.  Deal with it
We are not bitter, we are just smart enough to realize that Chump is a clown.
Ironic that #Hillary was "appalled" when @realDonaldTrump  wouldn't accept election results.
crybabies. They put their personal interests ahead of needed progress for our country!
that being said.  Your boys a nutter and you all know it.
Republicans obstructed for 7 yrs. Now you're mad the Democratics use your same tactics? You started it!
Plus they were out-foxed by Trump using Cambridge Analytica and 'fake news' to keep their voters home.
Trump Is just an embarrassment to the USA.  Everything is about HIM.....
BS!
Thanks for being honest America thanks you
In other news, water is wet.
Not out of line defending the nation from a sociopathic sexual offender
fuck the democrats and all their non-white and white traitors let's clean America from non-whites
she needs to retire
The Democrats have proven themselves to be sore losers.
It's so sad that the dem party won't stand up and call for a stop in the violence and destruction.
Think about what republicans have done snce Obama was elected, then say that.  With a straight face.
@wendyelisa36 look at this
Loved the shut down of that horrific  woman. She is really a bigot and plain psycho.
hatch needs to go.  we need someone under 80.  old fool.
Sore losers are whining crybabies, sad that the vote didn't go their way
THE DAWG AND BUBBA SHOULD BE IN PRISON!!!!!!!
Not about the loss just about the nut who is running our country and those backing him. & the Russians
THE PUSHBACK IS ABOUT THE WAY TRUMP DISREGARDS THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION.  MORONS.
No. Not bitter. Just pissed as hell that a rasicist, masogonistic asshole is our president.
The swamp is so much deeper than I ever imagined. The Dems on The Hill are EMBARRASSING. Warren is a whack job!
dems need to take their toys out of the sand box and run to Hillary to make it better!
When will this old white hypocrite guy retire? Orrin is what's wrong with the Senate. Retire now!
may GOD help them. I won't!!!!!!!!!!
retire grandpa.
We the people don't care about racist 
We want jobs We want to have good life 
We only live once !
acting very childish.
Bravo for the Senate, shutting Pochantas down was the correct action.
lemme go get my vagina hat & think about this for a min. Eyeroll....
They are bitter because Trump would never have won without intervention of Comey and Putin.
didn't burn our colleges and whine like babies. We accepted that Obamacare won like the adults we are.
The Dems  are so over the election. Now we're just wondering WHAT THE HELL
shameful and embarrassing how leftists are behaving
nope
like little children who cannot get their way!
POLITICAL? Nordstrom family financialy 
underTrump Billions less
Another will gladly take Ivanka line
I know some people who voted for Hillary but are now sick of everything that's being done afterwards
Of course they are. HRC had it within her grasp but she simply couldn't close the deal.
#MAGA Ez Warren is UNFIT to be a senator. Disgraceful behavior on US Sen floor, she must be punished!
good she krooked democraked politician they are a most racist party in USAhistory!they racist bad 
democraked politician fomenting racist and division! around USA and democraked krooked politician 
@debragg13 @OrrinHatch @HillaryClinton Agreed! But Reps also have faults.
#MAGA Eliz Warren acted in total disrespect toward US Senate & severe action must be taken against her!
I agree
That statement alone... is the saddest thing in the world.
So true bro. There sinply was no WORSE choice! It was 'her turn.' Americans didnt thk so!
I still have one of your buttons on my hat.
whats next Holding Ther Breath ???
It makes me think Democrat Party only cares about the party? It's about ALL the American Citizens.
@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton WE want President Trump to stay bold wise and courageous!! Hillary Barack and rest dems retire!!!!
I'm not so sure there buddy. I think it might have something to do with a nutcase in the white house.
.....Right on!!!!
All of their vote rigging and they still lost. Americans elected Trump.
This really does nothing to move gov along. They r the deplorable not me
what does @Hillary Clinton and the Atlanta Falcons have in common? They were both beaten by patriots!! #potus @realDonaldTrump
I agree
Oh hush Hatch. Republicans didn't do their jobs while Pres. Obama was in office. Got paid for nothing.
. Should have happened a long time ago.
so happy they shut her down. A decades old letter has no bearing on what is happening today. #poortaste
DemoNcrats are anti democracy they prove it daily with tantrums! They need to go back into their realms
Dems a bunch of cry babies
. We are stunned that so many ignorant fools fell for the Clown Act and elected it President.
they should expect to lose more seats in two years if they continue this negative actions
GOP would nominate a cow if it paid them enough money. It's all about the benjamins
DINOSAUR IN CAPITALS
sore losers. Ridiculous!
What do you expect when there was Russian interference?
