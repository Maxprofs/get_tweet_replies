Is he gonna talk about how much money he's taken from the NRA? If not I don't want to hear what he has to say
Thank you Senator. Hope your thoughts and prayers will now lead to your advocacy for sensible gun safety legislation.
You can hope in one hand and  in the other.  See which one fills up first. I'm going with 
Hold the @NRA line bc you're in the pocket of a terrorist organization.
Did you take your part of the blame?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney 
Better yet, send it to the Las Vegas victims' fund. Here, I looked up the address for you
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Why are you talking about the passing of your church's  religious leader? Can you not seperate state and religion? Are you above the law?
#Ashamed of you for placing special interests over #American Citizens. You are a traitor for allowing the murder of our citizens.
Your words mean nothing, laws could save lives. No war weapons for civilians.
"Faith without works is dead" - James 2:26
Hatch has lost all credibility. Just another partisan hack raking in the dough.
@senorrinhstch took $100,000 from NRA. They bought him and the rest of the GOP.
#sendbackthebloodmoney
W don't need your words, we need SIGNIFICANT gun reform. Represent me & fellow Utahns, not the NRA. #GunContolNow
Surprise us. Do something brave. Thoughts and prayers aren’t enough.
Why the f**k is this ass talking about Robert Hales on the senate floor?
The NRA has given you in excess of $40,000.  
#ReturnTheBloodMoney #NRAKills #NRATerrorism #GunControlNow
Surely Orrin u plan on giving the money u received from the NRA to the victims funeral expenses and the hospital bills.
Until you give back money from the NRA, I don't want to hear your opinion about the Las Vegas shooting my dude.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Speak on passing gun laws, repairing healthcare, protect Mueller investigation and protect country from POTUS tweets.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Elder Hales passing is sad, but what relevance does it have on the Senate floor? 
Waiting for a senator to do anything about gun violence is never going to happen. We have a pay to play organized criminal syndicate.
Maybe start with not taking any money from the FUCKING @NRA
How much more will the @NRA give you to continue bulling the real issue?
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
Does this mean we can get sensible gun laws and medical insurance that includes mental health coverage?
No
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands
Please return the money, Senator. You can't do your job when you're beholden to that extent. You're supposed to work for the Ppl.
As if your support for these weapons can be wiped out by a lame tweet. SHAME
It's time to #SendBackTheBloodMoney and stop being complicit in the mass murder of American citizens. The @nra is a terrorist organization
Constituent in 84106. Your words are disrespectful to every victim of gun violence. Save Utahns lives. Pass strict gun control laws!
If you want to say something worthwhile about #LasVegas, denounce the NRA & pledge to return the blood money you've taken from them.
Hatch accepted $98K from the NRA. #BoughtAndPaidFor
You are ayou are a hypocrite and have blood on your hands.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
NRA crook! Spineless evil Republicans.
You accepted blood money from NRA.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Thank you for your sentiments and condolences to the victims. Please send back the money, oppose the NRA #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney $100K needs to go back to the @NRA and stand up to them for once
Empty Prayers without Action

.@OrrinHatch got $97,848 from @NRA, so all he'll do is talk about gun violence on the Senate floor. 

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Senator Hatch: Stand against gun violence by returning the $97,848 in contributions you've taken from the NRA! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
And, in dutiful deference to your NRA  owners, you'll do nothing.

.You received nearly $100,000 from the NRA. Blood money, blood on your hands.
MAYBE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT

#SendBackTheBloodMoney

.@OrrinHatch got $97,848 from @NRA, so all he'll do is talk about gun violence on the Senate floor. 

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are killing us for NRA donations! Stop killing us!!
How much did the NRA pay for you? Was it worth all the lives lost in Las Vegas? #BloodOnYourHands
Senator wash the @nra blood money off your hands before taking to the floor. Might be unseemly
enjoy your blood money, Orrin!
@seniorrinhatch YOU  ARE  BOUGHT  BY  NRA !!!! what a croock ...
Republican and Democrat should pledge to take no money from the NRA and pas legislation  banning manufacture & sale of automatic weapons.
Do you job. Keep America safe. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Do something that will make a difference - ban asssult weapons now
.@OrrinHatch got $97,848 from @NRA, so all he'll do is talk about gun violence on the Senate floor.
You are an NRA accomplice to mass murder. You have failed your oath to protect us. Shove your useless thoughts & prayers. #GunControlNow

YES. IT. WOULD.

And then he'll go check his bank statement, when's the next NRA check coming?
Just pass tax reform
Hearts, thoughts and prayers mean nothing when you continue to accept NRA money and turn your back on the victims and their families.
I hope you will tell us how much money you have taken from the NRA
You're bought and paid for by the NRA.  Give back the money and do something to help.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney

You are an accessory to mass murder. http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Orrin_Hatch_Gun_Control.htm …
@GOP How about vote no today on gun silencers. Actions speak louder than prayers and Jesus would be appalled if you do nothing.
Maybe you should speak on how we need #GunControlNow - you take money from @NRA - #BloodOnYourHands
Spare us your empty words. TERM LIMITS. #TermLimits
Let’s hear you tell us you will stop taking $$ from the NRA and pass #GunControlNOW
Be sure to wipe the nra blood money off your hands first

RECEIVED $97,848 from @NRA what are you going to say?!?!?
what about CHIP?! Which you let EXPIRE for 9 million kids!
How many times have you stopped gun control .....taken over 10 million from @NRA
Here's a better idea- speak about implementing gun reform right now. This is disgraceful. Give the money back. We are watching.
Why?  He's not going to do anything about it.
$97,848 - that's what it cost the NRA to buy you.
This 2A tragedy, once again, proudly brought to you by the @NRA and @GOP .

If you're wondering how to define TERRORISM, GOP & NRA want to add a silencer to the next #StephenPaddock's weapon
