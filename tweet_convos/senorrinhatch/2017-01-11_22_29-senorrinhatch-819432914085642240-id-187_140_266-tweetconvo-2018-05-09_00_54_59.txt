Replace with what? You ppl have your insurance that is paid for by us. What don't you pay for your own? Fix that!
Weird that for all your talk about "repeal & replace," yall only seem to have a viable plan for the repealing part
+ patients choices will REALLY dwindle when they have to choose between lifesaving care and ruinous debt
Don't be disingenuous here, you don't care about "patients' choices," you just hate Obama
GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE TO READ FRIST RYAN   DON'T TRUST YOU AS YOU SOLD OUT OUR VETS PENSIONS & HEAELTHCARE
And your replacement plan is what? You had years and years to create an alternative plan. You have NOTHING!
@MrMurder37 @MimsyYamaguchi @Plantflowes @SenateGOP @SenJohnThune GOP plan is to weed out the sick, let them die w/o Dr's care.
where's the replacement plan? Oh right. Stay healthy or die quickly!!lets stop your coverage!
Watching GOP trying to repeal ACA is like watching my cat knock things off the shelf just because he can.
When are you going to tell us what it is? #clueless #jackasses
Early this morning, Senate voted on a budget that grows debt by nearly 50%.
@JJohnson2u @SenJohnThune The republican party has become a hate group..unequaled only by the KKK.
I agree
Let's see your plan. "Trust me" is not a plan. You're dealing with REAL PEOPLE.Give us YOUR insurance while you screw with ours.
you've had years to come up with some sort of replacement. What's taking you so long?
YOU ARE TOOLS
Your all a bunch of tools
when you say replace your lying. you have plans for repeal and a series of slogans for replace, no plans.
But replace with what? w/o a plan you're scaring hardworking Americans who rely on ACA for coverage.
No repeal without replacement. Jesus bade us heal the sick. Repeal will cost billions, & lives
I HOPE THAT U NOT KILLING A BLACKMANS FUTURE BUT PROCEED
replafe with WHAT??
@now7grandkids  Senate Republicans have now cast themselves as DOMESTIC #TERRORISTS! Tens of Millions of Americans threatened!!!
Show us the plan!
we have replaced health insurance with death panels. Just drop dead #GOP
What is the replacement? No replacement no repeal. You can not repeal without the replace, so where is it?
you have done nothing for 7 years, what makes us believe you now? You have no moral compass and no integrity.
the America people need to take to the streets and revolt. Millions upon millions of people.
Thune is not only a joke of a public servant, he's a joke of a man. GOP = Americas worst threat.
"...but, you know, without the replace part."
you ppl are beyond disgusting. Preying on the ppl that need the ACA the most. How dare you. #Shameful @GOP
I mean really. You're gonna allot money for trumps racist, ego stroke monument wall but take away ACA.
Plus, they're in conspiracy to commit Treason, in covering up Trump bring Putin's Pissy Poodle
Looks more like the promise to disaster ( for the non 1%).  #commonsensenotsocommon
GOP will simply wipe out 1/6 of US economy with this!! #GOPFail #GOPLies #GOPHates #NotOnMyWatch #ACA #HealthPolicy
What are you going to replace it with? Repealing without replacing is irresponsible!
#ACA
Irresponsible is the mantra of the GOP today!! #GOPFail #GOPLies #ACA #Healthcare #HealthPolicy #Resist
So very true!
The current cost of politicians is unsustainable. #repealandreplace #yesallpoliticians
replace with what
Republicans have done NOTHING to replace #Obamacare!! #GOPFail #GOPLies #ACA #Healthcare #HealthPolicy #Resist
GOP actions will cause insurers and H/C providers to go bankrupt! #GOPFail #GOPLies #ACA #Healthcare #HealthPolicy
Republican efforts will lead to millions of unnecessary deaths!! #GOPFail #GOPLies #ACA #Healthcare #HealthPolicy
GOP to strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans!! #GOPFail #GOPLies #ACA #Healthcare #HealthPolicy
Wake up!!!! The old system was unsustainable! That's why we adopted the ACA! #GOPFail #GOPLies #GOPHates #ACA
I'm from SD, your home state. I'm 26 and self employed. I'm freaked out about the ACA repeal. Tell me what you will replace it with.
But what is the "replace"? I hear the word but no details.
Excellent! The ACA is a total failure. Ive seen it 1st hand  as my office has enrolled thousands into the ACA.
Conspicuously absent: an actual replacement plan.
It's irresponsible to do even this without having one prepared.
One day should you actually care about the rest of us - maybe you'll get your souls back.   Maybe...
The American people want to see and comment on what, how it's being replaced. When can this happen. No closed doors
Potential blanket removal of insurance from millions is not an answer. It's a cowardly move.
#TrumpleThinSkin
Keep in mind that states that voted for the asshat Trump have the highest enrollment in Obamacare.
That's Why you vote while American People are Sleeping...AND THE REPLACEMENT? GOP Gouging us Again #NoIntegrity
# lies,lies!
Hi, could you help me understand the negative impact Obamacare has on your nation? I know most pros but not all cons.
Senate GOP sat on ACA for years without improvements. Your constituents paid the high price for your sick politics
The ACA (Obamacare) is a success as verified by almost every metric except your pathological refusal to accept it.
If you repeal ACA without a comprehensive replacement, you are personally guaranteeing people will suffer and die.
.@SenateGOP @SenJohnThune you have no fucking clue what you're doing. and you definitely don't have any plans to replace.
You are a bunch of murders.  May GOD have mercy on your souls.
I wish you could be made to attend the protracted deaths of your constituents who die from lack of medical care
You're the ones whose demands to cover your chums -er... donors wallets & profits first made ACA burdensome to some
#Liars You #required over 150 accomodations to ACA benefitting the Ins/Pharma industries over needs of patients.
consider GOV stepping away much like pre-Ocare Start at much smaller numbers not a tidal wave. Not the middleclass
why not fix it rather than repealing? Oh yeah, you'd have to share credit with Obama. God forbid.
if republicans are so convinced repeal is the right thing to do, why all the midnight meetings? So shady.
With what?
hope the plan includes explaining to your redneck support that Obamacare and ACA are the same thing lol
Shame on you!
Where is the replace?
Who do you asshole work for?
WRONG--6 years of repeal votes and no plan...  Read about the effect:  http://www.businessinsider.com/obamacare-repeal-and-replace-wont-work-2016-12 â€¦
Does the GOP gameplan at all?  7yrs and you have no plan how to move forward??
DT promise 1/3 cost- no deductible - 30 million still covered .. can't wait to sign up in June ..
why do Senate Republicans hate children and want them to die?
You should be ashamed of yourselves. People die without health insurance. Will you own that fact?
you had years to come up with a better plan. You have nothing and are an embarrassment.
Really no one wants you to Repeal it they only wanted you to "Act" like you would lol

what will you replace it with.
To take away health care for MILLIONS without having anything to replace it is CRIMINAL! What is wrong with you??
#speakerRyan Having unchecked power means you don't have to provide "a plan." #RepealAndRun  -#SenateDems
Will you be releasing the Minority Precedent Elects Russian Sex Tapes in VHS when they come out?
Tools in place. Check. Ideas to free people from fetters of employer-based HC? No check.
Ideas on how to cover millions who will lose coverage? No check. Ideas re: covering pre-existing conditions? Nope.
The tools you have in place are votes in the House. Period. And you are peddling snake oil.
so, what are you replacing it with? A "surprise"? #shame start representing your constituents instead of politically vindictive
Notice how it is not "the people" complaining about Obamacare. It is the politicians probably to benefit top 1%.
Shows how incompetent Ob' really is. A POTUS should have known this plan wasn't going to work. That's jst sabotage
@SenJohnThuneShame on http://you.You  are putting people's lives at risk and you think this is good#MakeAmericaSickAgain
You may have started the repeal of #Obamacare but NOTHING about the soaring cost and collapsing markets.
you don't repeal before you have a replacement in place, you will never erase Obama fellas, we see your ineptitude
#Liars
don't take away our health coverage. Please! Our lives literally depend on it.
How dare you pretend you have the people's interest in mind. Shame on you and your fucked up agenda
you've had 6 years to come up w a "better" alternative yet have NOTHING Mr Party of No
hope u guys have enough people to answer phones tomorrow !
.  You people need to leave ACA alone and just fix it.  Think about the people for once, not your egos.
What does affordable mean to the GOP? Why take away coverage for pre-existing conditions or people under 26?
And yet you fools offer no alternative. ACA is not perfect, but it was a start.
i like turtles
When history books write about the shame of this time period you and your fellow GOP morons will be highlighted.
And to those Americans you've just condemned to die? What do you have to say to them. People like my Mom.
I assume you'll give up your Entitlements too? that we,the taxpayer pay? You lost a lot of your constituents
If a lot of the Republican base dies from lack of healthcare - just redraw the districts till you get enough votes.
so, what are you going to replace the *ACA* with? Also, diabetic here. Thanks for trying to kill me. 
Liars. The "repeal" part is obvious, but not a peep about "replace". I challenge you, show the "replace" details.
Ok John, you've had 4 yrs to craft the ObamaCare replacement.  Where is it?  Are YOU going to let 20M just dangle?
you are devoid of human decency. What is your replacement? You have had years to come up with one.
shameful! We are peasants to you. If you cared you would support single payer.  I hope someone curses all of you.
The day you appeal Obamacare you better have a plan that day to replace it or the GOP Congress will look terrible.
okay but whatchu gon replace it with??? Cause after you dismantle it, millions will be left without coverage so whats tea??! ?
Lies! It was not unsustainable. GOP cutting funding to kill. Killing babies w cancer & our neighbors too
@realDonaldTrump-Here's where you step in, Bozo
You promised to protect pre-exst&kids.
Dont let @SenateGOP kill ppl
"The current Obamacare situation is unsustainable. We have put the necessary tools in place to repeal & replace Obamacare." â€“ @SenJohnThune 
. @SenateGOP y'all are a complete and total catastrophic embarrassment.
You guys are ridiculous. The country does not support the repeal. Grow up!
welcome to DEATHCARE.  GOP plan to save the RICH.  Way to go!  No plan in sight.
where IS your replacement?
reported......
Stop lying! You have no replacement! STOP THE REPEAL unless you can replace it!! #ENOUGHISENOUGH
The Un American cruelty you are showing will backfire.
@SenOrrinHatch if I lose substance abuse coverage & my daughter can't get help I will hold u personally responsible!
dont get upset people, Democrats have Flake, McCain, Graham and Rubio on there side. GOP wont get anything done
If you've put tools for repeal AND replace, what, then, is your replacement you have ready?
also call it ACA so your misinformed voters are properly informed
trying to sneak this while we are asleep. Slimy cowards. #obamacare #PreExistingConditions #HumanRights #Healthcare
evil
So, big pharma and big healthcare can rape and gouge financially at will?  #greatplan
InsCo selling across state lines will NOT make #Trumpcare more affordable http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2016/10/10/sorry-trump-selling-health-insurance-across-state-lines-wouldnt-lower-costs/#1269f6db5f01 â€¦
InsCo selling across state lines will NOT make #Trumpcare more affordable
How about Universal Health care for ALL U.S. citizens, like other GREAT countries provide?!
Will #Trumpcare includeCoverage PreExistingConditions?StudentsUntil26?Remove LifeTimeLimits?Provide PreventiveCare?
I wd NEVER choose to take your right to health. Ever! Why would you choose to take my healthcare? Not fix; take.
#souless
B4 #Obamacare motherhood considered preExistingCondition=Denied policies 4prevPreg,CSection,Miscarriage,Infertility
Will #Trumpcare protect US mothers?
If affordable patient-centered healthcare is accomplishable, why didn't you pass it prior to the ACA?
U.S.Mothers shouldn't be labeled as PreExisting Conditions for simply being women & mothers
.@SenateGOP You're one step closer to a full-on shit storm that Americans will hold you accountable for. #ACA #TheResistance
I can die without insurance my pre existing condition  will ensure I don't get coverage. People will die.
what is the replacement plan? I don't even need details just give me broad strokes.
All you plan on doing is repealing - Stop lying to America the majority of people do not want it repealed.
REPLACE WITH WHAT?! HOW MANY PEOPLE LOSE COVERAGE WAITING ON YOUR NONEXISTENT REPLACEMENT?! #RepealAndDisplace
You chucklefucks have no plan & no idea what you're doing except to screw over the very people who elected you, you're worse than pond scum
Does it make you *that* angry that the country elected a black president twice? Jeez
@SenOrrinHatch @SenJohnThune where is the replacement?
what's the plan. My family and business depend on ACA so I'd like to hear about the alternative.
where exactly is the "replace" part?
Some states are worse off from Obamacare than other states. Premiums are so high people go without healthcare
those states should have expanded.The taxpayer's are paying for funding either way.
Replaced with what???  Link please.
#ShowUsThePlan #ShondaGOP
Obamacare right now has an effect on the economy. Purchase power of the consumer goes down and so does GDP.
great! Single payer? That is the best way to go! #BigotInChief #FromRussiaWithHate
6 years you had to come up with alternative plan! That's embarrassingly incompetent! Who are you working for??
Cool just let people that gained healthcare keep the healthcare they gained from Obamacare and call it Trumpcare. @SenateGOP @SenJohnThune
Good to hear if true. If not the repeal/no replace will be taken as Read My Lips bait and switch.
don't  take away our Medicare benefits. Live on SS, can't  afford extra payments on medical and precriptions.
Not unsustainable It's saving lives You MUST protect people with preexisting conditions. Not doing so is criminal
so what's your plan? You can tweet a link to it for convenience
Repeal, yes.  Replace, not even close.
that isnt what you voted for. you voted to repeal. there is no replace
I kind of feel bad for Jennifer, she honestly believed you....
