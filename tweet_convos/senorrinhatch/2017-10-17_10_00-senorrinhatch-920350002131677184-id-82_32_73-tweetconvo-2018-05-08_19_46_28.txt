Why don't you reform this:
If they are rich!
All old white millionaires. Wonder who'll benefit from this cesspool?
Explodes the deficit and produces no growth.  All while increasing taxes on middle class to give the rich yet ANOTHER tax cut.  #TaxReform
Are You Kidding???? 
Do. The. Math.
GOP = Greed Over People.
We're disgusted -- we know the truth.
What bullshit
Reagan's policies ballooned the deficit and he ended up raising taxes later on, but you don't want to remember that part. #liar #theif
Trickle down economics doesn't work. The people in Kansas are suffering a great deal because they fell for the okie doke. #ShamelessGOP
Is this another one of those: rich people tax breaks, more money, drip some down to the people?
More lies from the GOP...or Government of Putin.
They're copying Reagan's plan which caused the GDP to soar- then it ALL came crashing down and families have required 2+ incomes since.

I'm sure all the Rich people in America are happy about the legislation...Deception!
Representatives of Amerika...OLD WHITE MEN.

sad
You would be.  You’re one of the worst of this bunch of clowns.  Go step on a lego.
Yeah sure you are! Such a joke republicans have become


Get the job done tick tock. Or resign
Working together does NOT MEAN you are ACCOMPLISHING IT! Do what we elected you to do for USA for a change.
Proud to screw hardworking Americans to give the rich&Corps huge tax cuts? Throw a few pennies at Americans NO
Trickle down = piss on the working class.  Tax breaks for corps/the rich don't help us.
BS
Tax reform is GOP old speak for screwing the middle class.
Profitable Companies, No Taxes: Here’s How They Did It
GOP will fail again.
Why?
Gee the millionaires club is meeting
Look at all the rich white men making decisions for everyone who isn't a rich white man.
Look at all the rich, old white men working together to fuck over America and line their pockets. Traitors every one.
The Never Trump GOP Fear Their Arrest
McCain & Petraeus Spy Ring Exposed
@GeorgWebb @wikileaks
no they are not. speak for yourself
Finance Committee; Key to Tax Reform. Forecasting overall impact max/min is tough. Use Reagan tax cut model; View impacts as percent change.
Reaganomics was the beginning of the economic disparity in this country and you want to cut taxes for the rich again.
Don't forget it's not just about money Corps keep offshore, but the dignity of Americans having decent jobs
Are you proud of creating the opioid epidemic too? You are rotten
oh bullshit. 
Even the morons that support trump know whats wrong with the gop plan
@SenateMajLdr @senorrinhatch please advise the president he shouldn't be threatening John McCain. It's quite abhorrent.
Retire, Orrin. You are an antique.
Love this!
@SenateMajLdr . You were proud of #grahamcassidybill as well. You learned Americans not as complacent as you suspected. #ResistanceUnited !
Maybe the Koch Bros. are but I’m not. It’s all about the rich with republicans.
Both of @TheDemocrats besties/extortion complicit @SenateMajLdr/@senorrinhatch need 2 retire or get run out like @SpeakerBoehner @EricCantor
Shysters.
ya working hard for the rich. not for the middle class and working families.

As Richard mentions, Treasury deleted its own study showing most corporate tax cuts go to profits, not labor income. Orwellian stuff. https://twitter.com/RichardRubinDC/status/919868928763088896 …

The FY18 Budget gives $1.5TRIL in tax cuts to the richest Americans. It cuts about the same from Medicaid & Medicare. Whose side are you on? 

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut corporate rate from 46% to 34% and wages fell. 


1/Trump's move to stop CSR payments to insurance companies hits Trump-won (red + most purple) states harder than blue. 

Senate has nothing to be proud of so far!  Only hot air, deceit and deception!
Yep that trickle down us a great new concept.. blowing up the deficit just like Reagan.
LIAR. #GreedOverPeople #EatTheRich
#TrumpTaxScam #TaxReform .@realDonaldTrump RT @nytimes #Kansas tried a tax plan similar to Trump’s. It failed.
Corporate Executive pay up 9000% since 1978 and your proud to cut their taxes...lol
#NoTaxCutsForRichPricks #KochHeads #Oligarchy
The proposal: 25% of the middle will get a tax increase. The 1% get a windfall. Medicare/Medicaid gutted-seniors and poor left in the cold.
It was uplifting to just see the McCain take another stand against the Donald.
