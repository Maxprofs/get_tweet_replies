It's SAD the GOP is taking our liberty away.
GOP are all party before country. Shame on your leader McConnell. 
A conniving,self serving inept shame.
Silence on GOP abt inept Trump. Make him resign. McConnell a coward with wife in administration is doing nothing. Not Trump
We are counting every day that you let trump do more damage to our country.
what do you have against women's healthcare? What the fuck is the controversy?
If you recall in history, pushing religious agendas has resulted in mankind taking many steps back.
This party is a joke and it's pretty clear it needs to be replaced by forward thinking individuals instead of fake ass christians
You must love picking one fucking line out of the Bible to suit your agendas. The Bible preaches inclusiveness and being a good person. Read
So is racism and fascism, two actual concepts you try to sell to suckers by calling it "liberty". "Arbeit macht freiheit". LIARS
Liberty, in the form a free and robust press, is the cornerstone of the American democracy 
A Pres who ridicules, is no Pres
Get off your high horse... GOP Senators are refusing to have in-person town hall meetings. Remember us? Your constituents?
Liberty and Justice for ALL #realnews

And that's what you need to act to get rid of Trump. He is endangering our liberty. Country before party.
Not within your corrupt pary!
I will celebrate presidents day when we the people of the United States have a president and a legislative branch of government
"Liberty, when it begins to take root, is a plant of rapid growth.” George Washington #HappyPresidentsDay
how hypocritical! You talk "Liberty" when what you do is degrade liberties.
Would love to be liberated from the hypocrisy of the Republicans in congress and the lying lunacy of @realDonaldTrump
The #GOP was dead prior to our @potus Either ride the wave of change or be pushed aside (voted away)as the #TrumpTrain chugs by.
There should be an apostrophe at the end of Presidents to indicate the possessive. Maybe @BetsyDeVosED can help you with that.
To bad @realDonaldTrump is hosing all our liberty down with Agent Orange. #punintended
You all need a wake up call. Oust ALL of you at the polls for it's painfully obvious that all but 2 of you need to go.
Interesting quote for our times, with a president moving to stop immigration and intern millions.
Happy President's Day @POTUS ! We SUPPORT YOU 100%! We are praying for you and for the Country to Stand WITH, BESIDE AND FOR YOU!
Lets not let our liberty be taken away by a would be   dictator with no respect for the truth, the law or the press.
happy Presidents' Day Obama you truly were a remarkable president.
MAGA by breaching the divides in our nation.Listen to all the people of USA and help them understand each other. Compromise
until someone pours chemical pesticides on it & it withers and dies like Trump presidential activities violate constitution
Take root?  We seem to have to keep rooting it though, don't we.
.@SenateGOP where is the replacement 4 ACA?  Heath savings accounts don't = healthcare. #VoteThemOut
.@SenateGOP @HouseGOP: But please remember that Washington was a slaveholder--denying said Liberty. #FactsMatter #HappyPresidentsDay #BHM
what's the matter- couldn't find any promo-worthy quotes from our current president?!  He's tainted this holiday for me too...
not 45*
Perhaps true, but our plant could use some water right now. Please work to #ImpeachTrump.
"Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company." - GW
For our liberty to flourish we must purge #GOP of those who work against Party & @potus thus work against Nation! #GreatAgain
It's a fragile and delicate creation, needing constant care. You are taking its resilience for granted, and US may pay the price.
@POTUS @HouseGOP  This plant needs water, air and sunshine. Protect the #FirstAmendment. The people will speak!
nothing will destroy liberty faster than political censorship that rejects God's values & the truth of history.
@MSNBC @ABC @CBSNews @DNC  nothing will destroy liberty faster than political censorship that rejects God's values & the truth of history.
Our patriotism may yet save us, help us to escape tyranny.
I agree, pass a bill banning #GOP members from accepting money from #GeorgeSoros who is anti-liberty and anti-USA. #TermLimits
if those roots are of a poisonous plant Liberty dies
by liberty I assume you mean Russian money and influence. Traitors!
Start the plans for President Trump up there
