The Senate's most important accomplishment thus far is the confirmation of Justice Neal Gorsuch. https://twitter.com/i/moments/839577397552955392 … #115thSoFar #utpol
Hatch has also continued to legislate, fighting for bills that specifically address the needs and priorities of Utahns. #utpol
Including Rapid DNA, which will give Utah law enforcement CRITICAL tools to keep our communities safer. #115thSoFar

DACA is not our priority. Secure Border, Repeal Obamacare even if no replacement, fix taxes. NONE of those have been done. Retire already
Dear sir, we realize that our party is taking advantage of all the uproar in the White House to attain our agenda but you need to impeach
The person driving vehicle had a police badge on & didn't even look like the mentally ill individual they are pinning it on. So disgusting!
Don't tell me that the Senator is fighting for my priorities.  He doesn't and your lying about it just ticks me off.
you have been in ofc 40 yrs. cant blame the new guy, all I can do is call and vote. 3 branches govern, Pass AGENDA voted in. PASS TAX REFORM
President Hatch! Our @POTUS is evil! We need to stop him. He is abusing innocent people & children. Protect DACA kids!
US is only home they know.  Their parents brought them here. Not their fault! We have a cruel & evil @POTUS 
It is clear that our President has no moral footing, no internal morals from which to govern. He is an embarrassment to the world.
ikr  We need new @POTUS 
@ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr @SenatorBurr @SenatorLankford

SHAME ON YOU!
@ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr @SenatorBurr @SenatorLankford 

Are you ALL absolutely nuts over there? Releasing Dossier? It's FAKE!
MAYBE you should worry more ABOUT REPEALING Obamacare, TAX REFORM, BUILDING THE WALL, INSTEAD OF ILLEGALS!! SICKENING!
...@slcmayor
Nurse arrested after refusing to draw blood: 'Somebody help me!' http://ti.me/2vRmffk  
Priorities are simply Utah citizens 1st. Americans first #EndDACA

@ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr @SenatorBurr @SenatorLankford 

I can guarantee YOU, if you release this FAKE Dossier; you'll be 100% HATED!
Let's be clear. You've fought for WHITE Utah priorities. You've thwarted the issue of public lands, offering them to oil co's on a platter.
Washington works fine, thanks much. It's the jackasses the rest of the country elects and sends here that are the problem.
Hi President Hatch
How you doin'!? 
I know Donald Trump. I don’t think there’s a racist bone in his body,” says Sen. Orrin Hatch. Really?
The GOP will lose both houses of Congress next year. You've nothing to lose now. It's time NOW for GOP Profiles in Courage & Pres. Ryan.
Southern Strategy

You own Trump. 100%.

Health Care, Tax Reforms/Cuts, Infrastructure Bills are DOA
& our future unless Congress embraces Senator McCain.
Utah residents, if you don't see Senator Hatch taking steps towards Trumps removal, I hope to see your disapproval in the voting booth.
So organize your troops to #RemoveTheNaziInTheWhiteHouse
Bulls%%%
President Hatch, when can you start?
Do more than talk! You're goin down in history w/ur name printed right alongside Trump unless u do something immediately. 25th amendment.
Please do something about the Nazi in the White House
Awful hard to see what tweets belong to Senator
Great that OJH is taking of his folks, yet ignoring the other 49 states. Last I looked his job is to take care of the nation not the state.
It is time for the republicans to pick sides between Nazi Trump and the Repubs

God bless you for speaking the truth
He has been mired to having his nose up the mainstream Republican ass.
then why don't you go back to work. Paid vacations are getting old and her insurance is horrible our taxes are horrible
And what is your plan to get Congress out of the gridlock?  You are a senior Senator.  You should be leading partisan talks not talkin smack
by doing what?  What have you done for repeal and replace ?  Tax reform?
Your party your president. Do something. Talk is cheap
You'll be held responsible for the violence, deaths that occur from your inactions, promotion of Nazis in our govt, supporting Russians
Liar
You,PaulRyan , Mitch McConnell . Made Sure Ppl Didn't Get Educated, Made Sure they Stayed Poor- All to Control Their Naive Minds! Power Play
Your President is the source of what we see. Hatred, Racism, Bigotry and Intolerance.

#HAHAHAHAHAHAHA #Swamp!!! how long have you been there #LOL..what was the debt when you first joined the good old boys club? #LIAR!!! #MAGA
Youre the most evil SOB the senate has ever seen
Gop to voters-we need house to get this& that done. Oh, and Senate. Can't do it without Oval. Got them all and...CRICKETS. NOTHING.
Utah priorities like undermining thousands of Utahans' health care and cutting services to give rich people a massive tax giveaway
Naaaa, he only cares about getting reelected. Oh, and being a career politician.
by voting to take health care from thousands of those from Utah? How is that giggling for them . How much from PHARMA Orrin?
Mired in Gridlock with the majority.   Poor leadership, poor governing,  just poor..
Gorsuch was NOT A UTAH PRIORITY.
He will hurt my interests for the rest of my life.
And GOP blocking previous nominee was despicable.
1 more thing. PLS get special counsel 2 look into Clinton FDN, Uranium1, Loretta Lynch, Lynch & WJC meeting, Podesta's connect to Russia!
Senator, I'm sorry I unloaded on U. I did in hopes that U might be able 2 light a fire under Republicans, unite them & get them 2 work!
Congress should have never taken this break. The workings of Congress is unconscionable. The elitism of Congress is reprehensible! Lawyers!
Y R Republicans letting Democrats humiliate them! Schumer & Pelosi speak, Republicans run & hide! All 3 branches. We need 2 unite & kick but
If Congress were a small business they wld B bankrupt & failed miserably. No taxpayer 2 bail them out. When will Republicans do their job!
Like...........?
Congress would all be FIRED if they worked in corporate America. They would B fired 4 dereliction of duty! That is really true but sad!
DC is a disgrace 2R nation! First, get rid of the Lawyers! Congress has become Gov't welfare 4 lawyers who can't make it in real world!
Why do you hate the middle class so much? http://politicsthatwork.com/voting-record/Orrin-Hatch-300052 …
You could have assured Rep Mo Brooks' CLEAN REPEAL passed (HR 1718)...YOU DIDN'T Doing bidding of insurance lobby https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1718/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Obamacare+repeal+act%22%5D%7D&r=2 …
Always looking for the aide right behind him making sure he looks coherent.
Good thing you're on top of all this. Seems you may be @potus in a few months.
You haven't stood up for Utah values. Only @GOP values. When is tillers on making decision about consult processing issues
