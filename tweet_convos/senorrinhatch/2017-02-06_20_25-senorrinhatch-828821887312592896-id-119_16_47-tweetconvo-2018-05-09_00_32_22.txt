thank you for reminding us all how the Republican Party is paid for. Shameful qualifications no longer required
you reach for excuses to cover the fact you sold out our Utah schoolchildren
.@SenOrrinHatch I shall donate to the campaign of your opponent in the 2018 race for your Senate seat because you voted to confirm DeVos.
Shame on you! DeVos is NOT qualified. She's a disgrace. You do NOT care about children if you voted for her. Disgraceful!
#DeVosVote @SenOrrinHatch @ThomasSowell @SenateGOP @RealClearNews #NoDevos!!
. Listen to the American people, VOTE NO ON DEVOS!  You cannot be deaf to our voices!
Senator Hatch ignored the needs of 93% of Utah's children that attend public schools by voting for DeVos.
buh bye!
no links to support anything said in this article. #NoonDeVos
why don't you listen to THE PEOPLE that voted for you!?  She gave $800k to @SenateGOP! FACT!!
Your vote is inexcusable. Money talks. Shame on you.
SHAME ON YOU! #CowardlyCongress
#STOPDEVOS #NODEVOS
and the fact she owns for profit schools
You will NEVER receive a vote from my house. You are unworthy of your office.
OMG can you be more full of sh*t? You make me ashamed to be from Utah. The people don't want her!
NO ON DEVOS! Not compelling at all! Call Hatch's office and TELL HIM NO: 1-202-224-5251.
#StopDevos she can do nothing but DESTROY educational platforms! Listen to your constituents!
looking at your SM I see none of your voters asking for a yes #nodevos or else I vote NO on you 11/6/18
There is not a single reply to this tweet that is in support of Devos. Listen to your constituents.
need to watch Sen Hatch's campaign donations see how much he was bought for
She is unfit and your vote  for her will cost you votes in the next election.
, Way to go SenHatch. Good Job. Ill vote for you again if you run!!!
You voted for money over the education and future of our children. I hope you are held accountable. Shameful.
is it a list of the millions and millions of dollars she has donated to Christian ed?
This is as transparent a pay-for-play handout for a big donor as the Senate has ever seen. Pathetic.
shame on you
Why are you even in Washington? Are you there for our families or your family?
As an educator you must vote NO on DeVos! Listen to the people.
She is incredibly IGNORANT and NOT qualified. My tax $ isn't going to her RELIGIOUS cult school.
your constituents don't want her. You might know that if your VM wasn't full. #utpol
As a parent in #WV,nothing about this was compelling. Public schools are all we have.
fake news!
why aren't you and the other GOP senators listening to the majority of VOTERS? #noDevos
.@SenOrrinHatch your constituents and other citizens ask you to vote NO on @BetsyDeVos. Unqualified and not competent. #noDevos
This woman is a lobbyist and has no business in the President's cabinet. Pay to play
there are qualified candidates. Why this one that cannot answer basic questions?
NO Stop lying to the American people. We watched her hearing. She's as dumb as a rock
this is what @BetsyDeVos can do for education: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_htSPGAY7I â€¦; don't perpetuate the problem, mend it
Do not want.
do not vote for DeVos. She is unqualified. This is not what your constituents want.
Thank you for enabling the corrupt regime to flourish. Long live the #Kleptocracy! #NoOnDeVos #ThisIsFine
No to De Vos who is ideologically opposed to public education; wrong for society
Sir, please vote no. She is not qualified for the position!
you should be ashamed. Future generations' edu. depends on a woman w/ no xp? Compelling? Really?
stop walking the party line and listen to your voters or they won't vote for you anymore. Vote NO on Devos!
like what #BetsyDeVos did for Michigan education? Funding cuts & charters dropped it like a stone from 28th to 41st place.
Devos is not competent for ed sec. This is not what your constituents want.
2018 WE WILL SPEAK AGAIN AND YOU WILL BE LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB
we, the people have spoken, we said No to DeVos - you aren't listening.
our children's education continue to suffer. Your state doesn't want this! LISTEN!
you're not listening to your people. You vote her in and we will remember as we watch
The article says DeVos will send tax $ to "voucher schools or parochial schools." Utah voted against this. Please represent.
DeVos isn't qualified! How are you protecting students with disabilities? Vote #NoOnDeVos
DeVos is unqualified for this post. I hope that you put country over party when voting this week.
Vote no on Devos, she is dangerously unqualified. You better start listening to us.
.@SenOrrinHatch incredible writing: "Mrs. DeVos has shown for more than 20 years that she thinks schools exist to educate children." Amazing
Here's what Betsy DeVos can do to Jews...
this is #fakenews #DumpDevos #noDevos #
if  by compelling you mean destroy...then sure.She will destroy education. #DumpDevos #noDevos
NO. DO NOT CONFIRM HER.
oh and schools do not need to be for profit. Look at the mess in FL
I guess you aren't listening to fears: no experience, not all public schools fail
S Hatch you took money from her. Step aside
I disagree with this article. Charter schools undermine the value of public schools. This is not about unions.
please vote no and could you return the #StolenScotus seat you @SenateMajLdr and @ChuckGrassley stole as well Thanks!
this strategy has not worked Detroit or else the sens. from MI would support her.
looks like hatch got passed on by DeVos, she gave cruz 90k , hatch only got $2k
we don't want her Orrin!
How many more constituents do you need to hear from? You are not untouchable. You will be voted out. #utpol
Vote NO on DeVos. Listen to your constituents. Listen to educators.
please vote No on this conformation. We need you to be our champion
This is a nightmare! Listen to the masses!!! No Betsy DeVos
your grasping for justification of your vote. This article doesn't hold water!
please represent your constituents for once! Vote NO! The paternalistic "I know best" does not work here!!
As your constituent, if you vote yes for this woman I will vote NO for you.
I know it's too much to ask, but please represent us, the voters. Not your campaign donors.
Vote for your constituents, not for her donations.  Vote no on DeVos.  #DumpDevos
here's what she'll do for education, ruin it
not part of a union, but as a teacher I fear for how she will destroy kids' education
Looks like Repubs are going to get decimated in 2018
She can destroy education, so it's easy for @GOP to brainwash us, to vote against our interests.
sadly it looks like you are the one that is misinformed
I thought you were a proponent of public education. Utah voted down vouchers!  Let's work on improving our schools
how disappointing. DeVos is out of touch with the educational needs of students.
you're endorsing fake news? Shame on u. Let her ruin Utah schools if u like her
we don't want her in Utah either!
do you actually find this compelling? Have you talked to any of the profession educators about reasons against her?
Based on the fact she has zero experience with any part of her role at DE, thats all wishful.
This is compelling? You ignore evidence of Russia interference in our elections & this is compelling?
charter schools need careful regulation or they turn into a money grab
Father God if you want her there touch the hearts of those that can bring justice for her.
I have the same amount of experience why not nominate me? I even attended a public school. +1 for me
your constituents don't want her. Please vote no!
Filling the swamp
you're wrong sir...just plain wrong...
nope
can't you find someone *qualified* to lead the charter school charge?
@utahpolitics @ThomasSowell @SenateGOP @RealClearNews listen to constituents
not incredible nor compelling.There is nothing new in this "article"
how about talking about the great public schools in your state,senator?
compelling? Absolutely not S. Hatch, this is a nightmare. #kidsovefpolitics #noDeVos
I KNOW BETSY DEVOS AND SHE IS SATAN INCARNATE. JUST LIKE HER BROTHER.  NO FUCKING WAY.
Baloney!!!
