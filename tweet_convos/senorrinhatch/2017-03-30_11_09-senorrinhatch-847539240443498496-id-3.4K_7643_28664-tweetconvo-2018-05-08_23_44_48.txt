I dont care what the GOP has to do to confirm Gorsuch, JUST DO IT
Its time to GO NUCLEAR!
No. Confirm Garland, whose seat your party Unconstitutionally stole from Obama because he was black and you're racist. Disgusting.
Nothing was stolen. Dems need to quit obstructing everything so we can move this nation forward.
Horsesh-t, U totally moronic, ignorant tea bagging hick.  GOP refused hearings for over a YEAR on constitutionally-nominated SCOTUS nominee.
Yup... you sound exactly like the Dems. Don't get your way and all you can do is call names.
Horsesh-t, U totally moronic, ignorant tea bagging hick.  GOP refused hearings for over a YEAR on constitutionally-nominated SCOTUS nominee.
You sound like wholly ignorant, under-educated hick. Go finish your GED, take off the tin foil hat, and turn your life around.
Confim him now. Tax cuts, jobs, immigration. Stop talking and let's start Doing! That wall is not going to build itself. Tax cuts, Tax cuts!
If you cut all the taxes how are you going to pay for that wall? Or for @realDonaldTrump's weekly golf trips.
Idiot! Trump covers the majority of his golfing trips AND still works. Unlike #44 and family who took advantage of the tax payers.
What's your source? Does he pay for Air Force One? All his additional security? Didn't he say during campaign he wouldn't leave the WH?
By default and changing 200 years of tradition
Confirm Gorsuch. Stop the slow process and Confirm now. Please "Tweet" this so we can spread this we American people want him confirmed now.
Some of us have better sense than that dear.
Obviously you are not one with the good sense!  Most liberals are missing this so you fit in just fine! RKM !
Talking about good sense, your President fired missiles without going thru proper channels instead of sending humanitarian aid. #dictator
Release your taxes.
#fuckgorsuch #fucktrump
Hell no
#WithdrawGorsuch #ConfirmMerrickGarland #SCOTUS
#getagrip
Release your tax returns.
are you sorry  yet?
More cronies for the dictator.
Your base is Conservative
. Let's do this!
Time to go nuclear and stop all this nonsense
Delete your account
No...
No he will be a disaster for this country, because his nomination came from a president who is under FBI investigation.
best man for the job!!
- we should not confirm a judge during the final months of a President's tenure in office.
If this good man is not confirmed, the democrats need to be shot!
I hope that Democrats realize if they try to filibuster Gorsuch they will get even more conservative Justices next time...
Let's hope common sense prevails. Gorsuch is qualified and seems to be fair in his rulings. He won't just rubber stamp rulings.
No matter what though GOP can go Nuclear and confirm Gorsuch but I'd hope Dems can confirm like GOP confirmed 2 of Obama's Justices.
If he were neutral and fair, there wouldn't be an 8-figure TV ad buy about how neutral and fair he is
Did you listen to the hearings?  

He is exactly the person you want as SCOTUS.
Originalism is the last thing you want in a court, especially the SCOTUS.
Someone who upholds current law and doesn't rule from the bench?  

Congress writes laws, not judges.  Judges uphold existing laws.
Ruling from the bench bypasses the inherent checks and balances in our government and allows for abuse in the present and the future.
Confirm Merrick Garland first
Trump is in the last year of his presidency, avoiding to GOP he can't nominate a SCOTUS. #Trumprussia #ObstructTrump #TumpforPrison
Ahhhhhhh ha ha ha, there was no Russia. #8MoreYears #Ivanka2024
Seriously, are you living in fantasy land? This whole admin is crumbling. Or are you one of those Russian bots?
Actually, after seeing your profile, I'll go with definitely a Russian bot. Howdy, Komrad!
he looks healthy. You look overweight and physically round

MUST SEE:
.@selectedwisdom on #TrumpRussia:
 Q: Why did these Russian active measures work?
 A: Because the Trump campaign helped them work. 
Sound familiar?
You shouldn't be able to secure a judge while under federal investigation for collusion with a foreign government.
Duh.
Should Trump be allowed to nominate a SCOTUS judge while under investigation for collusion with Russia?
#TrumpRussia is blowing up. 
#TheResistance
Is anyone else tired of all the "winning" yet?
#TrumpRussia
5. @realDonaldTrump isn't under investigation,people under him are & so far no wrong doing.Why was he under surveillance by @BarackObama
I can #ConfirmGorsuch looks like the muppet Beaker come to life.
It's like muppets come to life in D.C. These days.
#ConfirmGorsuch Because that's what the American people want.. #Scotus 
 Trump with a 35% approval rating is most definitely NOT what the ppl want, including his SCOTUS pic
No.
Why not?
Why should I?
You're the one who made the initial statement.  I assume you already have reasons.
No, Trump made the initial statement. Ball's in his court, and hashtags aren't going to cut it.
Remember how #45 said we weren't going to pay for the wall? I'm cracking up he is such a LIAR!!!!
Vote Against corporatist Gorsuch

A President being under FBI investigation is stronger basis to wait than a President being in 8th year of his term
https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/847089841095540741 â€¦
But what does that have to do with Gorsuch and whether or not he is qualified for the job?
What did Obama being in his last year in office have to do with Garland's ability and qualifications for the job?  Double standard!
So petty revenge is the motivation here.

Do you really want that from your government?
#FILIBUSTERGORSUCH #FILIBUSTERGORSUCH #FILIBUSTERGORSUCH because of #TrumpRussiaCollusion #TrumpRussiaCollusion #Russiagate
What does any of thst have to do with Gorsuch's qualifications?
Also, if they filibuster him, the Reps will use the "nuclear option" that the Dems created.

It is not the hill they should die on.
You saved the country for total liberal destruction.
His qualifications are obscured by how Garland was treated and especially by how you have trolled so many. You are personally to blame.
How does that obscure his qualifications?
Simply - people will look at Garland's treatment and say "tit for tat" - they'll look at Drumpf's bullying and say "let's get back at him"
And this somehow makes Gorsuch unqualified?
Garland was qualified - Gorsusch has a Trump problem not a qualification problem - I'm using little words.
And this justifies denying him the position how?

You've given me no rational reason to deny him the position.
It is a foolish mind that looks for rational reasoning in the Political program - and please do not use the word rational near Drumpf.
So you don't have a rational reason.
Particularly not a when the nomination was not yours to make in the first place.
How does this effect Gorsuch's qualifications?
We have no idea, that is the point. Republicans wouldn't accept Obamas nomination, and he wasn't being investigated for anything.
So Gorsuch is being rejected entirely on the grounds of petty revenge?

Is that what you want from your government?
He was selected by a possible traitor. He and everyone in Trumps administration is a risk until proven otherwise.
A traitor does not get to appoint a lifetime judicial position. Particularly not when the appointment was not his to make. Confirm Garland.
And this effects Gorsuch's qualifications... how?
As long as you are under investigation for colluding with Russia to win the presidency, none of your nominees should go through.
How does this effect Gorsuch's qualifications?
It doesnt and that isn't the point.
...so Gorsuch should be confirmed.
NO!!!!
No one asked you, Trump was addressing the people that matter no the crying babies unable to act like adults.
no
HELL NO
I'll say this in Russian, so you're sure to understand... NYET
Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia
Trump keeps taking credit for deals struck while Obama was president
How many?
Any is too many
Mention any
I was not asked the question. Try to pay attention. Go look and see for yourself.
Answer my question don't spin this
The Chandler Factory 2011 Deal The Investments  made by Exxon announced in 2013
Held back by obama not to take off
#WithdrawGorsuch !!!!
Keep far right conservatives away from the Supreme Court
He is moderate.  As neutral a judge as you or anyone could ask for.

With a history if fighting executive over reach.
He is not a moderate. He is a deeply conservative originalist.
He has a history if opposing both sides if they violate the law.

He upholds the decision of gay marriage by the SCOTUS.  Law above ideals.
no
Why not?
Because, I said so. 
Sadly, this is the most reasonable response to this question I've had today.
I'm a Dad.  Its what I do.
Only the good parents...always explain their reasons for saying no
With this knucklehead, I will forgo the explanation.  We tried that.  Its time now for him to introduce a fork into the electrical socket.

WE HAVE TO WATCH IMMIGRANT RUNNERS , LIKE HOW SOMKEY ROBINSON LEFT DETROIT FUCKED UP BY BUYING ALL THE HOUSES AND PUTTING IMMIGRANTS ....
IN THEM TO SCRAPE THE CITY AND THEN WHEN THEY DIED THEY LEFT ALL THOSE HOUSES AND BUSINESSES ABANDONED ALL FOR DOPE, ALSO BRINGING ....
IMMIGRANT KIDS AND BUYING SCHOOLS AND PUTING THEM IN THERER AND SAYING "WE DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR RECORDS " WHEN THEY GET OLDER...
AND THEN PONNING THEM TO ALL THE BUSINESSES TO SCRAPE THE CITY AD REARRANGE THE CITY FOR THEMSELVES , MAKING IT HARD FOR OUR AMERICAN KIDS..
TO GET JOBS DUE TO THESE ACTIONS , THEY ARE ALSO TRYING TO RUN ALL PUBLIC COMPUTER SYSTEMS SO THE IMMIGRANTS CANT SEND MESSAGES AND TELL ...
THEIR PARENTS HOW BAD THEY'RE BEING TREATED AND BEATEN , THIS IS A EGULAR ACCURENCE IN ALOT OF STATES WHERE ARTISTS GET ON DRUGS AND ....
CANT AFORD TO PAY BACK THE LABEL , LEAVING THEM TO RESORTING TO RUNNING IMMIGRANTS TO TRY TO TAKE OVER THE CITY TO PAY FOR EXPENSES .....
AND STAY HIGH , WE HAVE TO WATCH THE OPENING OF SCHOOLS , MR. HARRIS , TD JAKE , MASON BEHTA , THE REDDINGS , SEAN COMBS , ALL COLORED.....

NO F'ING WAY! WORST ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA!
#Gorsuch is owned by dark money supporters. Why are you guys afraid of transparency and #ethical behavior?
Nope. No robe til Deeeeep Probe. #gorsuch will never sit on the Supreme Court. It's seats are not for stealing.
Love this man
Gorsuch is far right. His mind is corporation infused! His justice is blind to the individual.
Reps already established cannot approve a nominee of a Prez who is running for reelection- it should matter too if he's being investigated
He doesn't care about special needs children.

Give Garland his hearing.
Only if he gives up the source of his 10 million gift.
You haven't appointed one qualified cabinet member, Gorsuch for supreme court just reimforces thta. What does Russia have on you by the way?
Confirm Garland

All Democrats that don't vote for him & are up for reelection in 2018, it should be their last term...watch how they vote & let it be known
Nyet
We'll get right on that after 1-Merrick Garland is confirmed & 2-Only if you're not impeached. Which you probly will be cuz you suck.
. @POTUS Considering what's been going on with Russian collision by your picks, all of your picks should be stopped until that's sorted out.

The Greatest Generation wrote immigration laws to accept only qualified people, people who belong to a Theocracy are not qualified
Nope he hates you
NOPE! That's Merrick Garland's seat, and illegitimate so-called presidents don't get to shape our judicial system for decades. RESIGN!
