what would an extremely un-Zinke move be tho
doing something lame
you can tell the interior secretary doesn't horse around
Why not?
Park Police invited the Secretary for a brief ride around the corner to the welcome reception.
now if he would back that bad boy up to Pelosi and Schumer's desk and take a big dump 
Where is he going to park it?
I guess that's what the Park Service is for
HOPE THE HORSE DONT POOP,,THE DEMS WILL LYNCH HIM
@jaketapper @BSEEgov as a third generation Montanan my only reaction is...
5th generation and I couldn't agree with you more! Spot on. He's an idiot.
ahhh, finally working to reduce carbon emissions
Police  horses are the best form of crowd control,two horses can clear a street of protesters just by walking sideways .
@bostonrandy Piker.
@pivbee1 @beck_ann4
Looks like an episode of 'McCloud'.
@jaketapper That is pretty darn tacky. Did he ever ride his horse to work when he lived/worked in Montana? Doubt it.
R U serious?  This guy IS Montana.  And a SEAL to boot.   He walks the walk ... don't be an ass.  @byrdinator @jaketapper

@passantino @BSEEgov what a dink. #zinke
I think we should all go back to riding horses
I see two cops and a horses ass
@aduanebrown @BSEEgov that horse is ADORBS!
@jaketapper @BSEEgov oh shit, the horse was given to him by Putey!! Let's call for a Russian investigation here too! SMH
Keep shaking your head, Sean. You'll be doing it when Trump fires you. You must know this.
Ummmmmm.  That's not the Sean you think it is.........
Nah, I bet she truly believe that he is the real Sean. Remember she is a Liberal and it explains everything. :)
@bravosierra2010 @BSEEgov loooove!!! Did I say love already!!!
PARL POLICE STABLES,,PARK WITH FEED AND WATER,,NO CHARGE
@jaketapper @BSEEgov what's sad is this kind of dog and pony show, no pun intended is all it takes to give righties a chubby
.@byrdinator @PhilAMellows Así quisiera yo ver a Zoido yendo al tajo, pero con sombrero cordobés, marsellés y zahones 
Make Money $500/day Increase Traffic to Website 10KHits Traffic Exchange http://eepurl.com/cEDE6v 
how incredibly cool! Riding a horse to work...as an equestrian and horse lover losing rights everyday ... heartwarming
@jaketapper @BSEEgov oh please, will Trump be riding a scorpion next? Pffft
Why would a scorpion let another scorpion ride it? It knows their nature
Points
What a clown. Like when @SenScottBrown drove a used pickup truck around MA, hiding his Benz in a garage.
or like Hillary and her hot sauce.
unlike "Hot Sauce Hillary" this man walks the walk.
LOVE THE JEANS & HAT! GO TO http://www.healingofthenationsministries.org  Cowboy Connection Page to get a parder look.
jackass rides horse to work
This man is a horse rider not a horse lover. Don't be deceived by this pic that this man cares about them.
In my youth I was able to ride a horse to school on some occasions and I always took the opportunity.
That looks... expensive.
@DebAlwaystrump @BSEEgov alpha male
I'm thinking I'm gonna like this guy
So cool.
SO COOL!
.@byrdinator @BSEEgov totally awesome!
When people said this administration was rolling back in time, didn't think it would go this far back!
what the hell
Too bad he supports horse slaughter and rodeos. Horses are tool of disposal for him.
Pretty dang cool !!
Environmentalists want to know exactly how many miles per bale of hay he gets & shouldn't the standard be higher?
Where do you park a horse in DC?
so we are paying Mon 3 park rangers to get this guy to work...Mid morning.....
@GingerMarple @BSEEgov #mccloudgoestowashington
Pretty sure I love this guy already. Badassery is in abundance in DC again #MAGA
. Love it!
But who gets to pick up the big pile of horeshit following behind him?
Didn't know you could do that! :)
@PhilAMellows @BSEEgov that's America!
@vjeannek @BSEEgov "I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I'm wanted (wanted), in the Whitehouse."
.@byrdinator @BSEEgov Just like Mussolini.
como mola @conchacornejo
So there were two horses asses at the White House today!
a horse with an extra ass.
Ask the Dems to pick up the shit in the road

Is Sessions new job in the Cabinet, Minister of cleaning up Horseshit? 
Literally every person in Montana is rolling their eyes into oblivion at this photo op. My FB feed is hilarious right now!
@ChiefFabulous @BSEEgov LOVE THIS THANK YOU!
Where does he park him during the day? Just wondering.
@JenniferJJacobs @BSEEgov This is truly fun to watch! God Bless Trump!
...... kinda cool 
@kerpen @BSEEgov I have said it before - love him or hate him this Trump presidency is at least going to be very entertaining!
@JackPosobiec @BSEEgov I hope the horse took a dump on Pelosi's car
what a zink
@johncardillo @BSEEgov Pretty cool!
As if D.C. Traffic isn't bad enough...
@JackPosobiec @BSEEgov Nice-looking Appaloosa!
Yeah, we like what that does to rush hour traffic in DC.
greatest move ever
Putin would be proud
@LINPEP @BSEEgov Trump isn't trying to roll the clock back to the 1950's. He's trying to roll it back to the 1850's.
@christinawilkie @BSEEgov being a cowboy in no way effects concern among Native Americans. Most impacted by his position.
@BenBerkon @BSEEgov They love horse back riding! First Paul Ryan at the border now Zinke? At least they kept their shirts on. 
Glad he's at least one person in the cabinet that's not a climate change denier
bunch of eccentric old men in this administration.
@SenOrrinHatch @BSEEgov @jeffsessions is a liar.  He needs to resign.  Orrin, you are nieve or a fool to believe otherwise.
That's making an entrance. Cool!
"on my horse, ready to make it easier to pollute & to sell off public resources!"
It's 2017 not 1817. It cries of "Look at me!" "Look at my hat!" "I'm a man of the people!" What a buffoon.
How  much did that little stunt cost?
proposed budget cuts are hitting DC hard
I hope one day to have this much confidence.
Not so great on the horse,is it #homeOfTheSlave
@Nikdalpra absolutely love this move
why does he have a police escort? How much money is that costing?
photo op where is his helmet?
Putting Prius owners to shame......
Where else is he gonna get his horseshit?
I disagree with his policy, but he's a badass Ex Seal Team 6 member.
@StevenTDennis @BSEEgov  Like Trident on his campaign bus, he's a typical Seal showboat. Army Rangers=real quiet professionals.
Needs 2 park police escort,apparently. How many would he need with conventional transportation?
Two. A driver and a bodyguard
@_sooosan he's from Montana
did u mean haley or secretary ryan
the guy on the horse
thats gonna be us
what the
think about it
I wonder where he parked it.
He's got "people" to do that for him. Most of Trumps picks have "people"
He is riding the president to work?  The Horses Ass
So, there will be even more horse shit on the hill? Seems appropriate. Be even better if he rode a bull, though.
Why doesn't he walk?
classic Zinke!
well....he is a horses ass.
Thats called a photo op.
@mattdpearce @BSEEgov is that an American horse or a Russian horse? Did the horse pass security? Ask for papers. Check horse ID.
How much did this stunt cost taxpayers? Post walk cleanup, boarding & transportation for horses, traffic control? Waste
Ahh, it's a D.C. police horse. @byrdinator @BSEEgov
wtf ever.
@BretBaier @BSEEgov he was just demonstrating the amount of political  horse manure that is cluttered all through DC!
@jaketapper @BSEEgov why?
@tomsegura this guy definitely wears a high school class ring
I LIKE IT!
who cleans up after the horse?
@jaketapper @BSEEgov nice, save on  and car wash,
That poor horse, in DC traffic. Zinke apparently also hired a photographer to shoot the epic moment. Only photo?
no worries. They're trained for that. There is a mounted force in Metro, I believe.
Extremely dick move.
I'm an appy fan, but I certainly hope we are not paying for the care of one for secretary transportation purposes 
In the summer he'll show up shirtless on horseback like the new president from Russia. Sings~I got to be a macho man.
could he be anymore ridiculous!  Get to work and stop drawing attention to yourself!
@BretBaier @BSEEgov love it
#Trump #WhiteHouse doesn't need another cowboy! They already have enough horsesh*t with #Sessions! #POTUS
how much extra taxpayer $$ did this cost?  Could've taken a bus
ripping off @ynscspds
@thegarance @BSEEgov Which one is the horse?
We have a new sheriff in town. Joke aside he truly looks like he's gonna end up shooting someone @byrdinator @BSEEgov
why???
-more horseshit ?
@jaketapper @BSEEgov WHY??? In the middle of the city?? 
Ahh, it's a D.C. police horse. @byrdinator @jaketapper @BSEEgov
still faster than taking the Metro
does scoop his horses poop?
@KattyKayBBC @BSEEgov 
Hope he cleaned up after the horse if he used the bike lanes...
Extremely thoughtless otherwise...
McCloud
@BretBaier @BSEEgov 
Nice,
Where's he gonna camp or get his grub from, or find a waterin' hole for his hoss? He's obviously very qualified.
what a stupid show - plus wasting park police time playing his cowboy games
What in the actual hell.
But why? What's the statement?
@maggieNYT @BSEEgov 

Talk about grandstanding!  WTF?
@maggieNYT @BSEEgov  Clowns will be Clowns
@BretBaier @BSEEgov I like this guy. Cowboy up, Ryan!
"wheee! I'm a cowboy! Lookit me, Daddy!"
I love it! 
Seems fitting. @GOP and @POTUS are trying to drag us back to the 1800s, so we might start riding horses to town again.
that's a bad American right there. Why isnt he driving an American made car? I thought "America First?"
Horse was "born in America!" @byrdinator @BSEEgov
@jaketapper @BSEEgov well alright. He should keep this going and just ride his horse everywhere in DC
@111victories thought you'd admire the swagger here, jacky
He better be scooping the poop.  (I suppose some intern gets the shit job.)
bad move, no cup holder. Thursday is cowboy day, so go ahead & wear jeans...and a hat...and bring your horse to work.
In D.C. traffic? What a guy.
As a Montana resident...not feeling good about this.
As WY resident, I agree. And get that damned hat shaped. It is horrid
This photo wins the internet for the day
@mattdpearce @BSEEgov #BadHombre
@jaketapper @BSEEgov we can afford to feed & care for horse but not hot school lunches?
My kid gets free lunches as does everyone else in her school.
@jaketapper @BSEEgov Time to dust off the old Si Kahn song "Government on Horseback Again"?
May not like his boss (or him either, we will see) but once in a while you got to give somebody "style" points.
@maggieNYT @BSEEgov Just what is needed. More performance art.
cool?
Every since he was a boy he dreamed of riding a   Trojan horse to WH.
I see that he is already prepared for the nuclear apocalypse. Smart move.
@BretBaier @BSEEgov bravo! Maybe it's the next solution to cities' congestion and carbon footprint. Here goes Teslas stock...
Now he will be criticized for animal abuse and contributing to the methane problem.
@BretBaier @BSEEgov how cool is that. Looking forward to all your help and the interior.
@BretBaier @BSEEgov I think he's going to take the job seriously! Very cool!
Does this mean he'll protect the #Mustangs?
he's still a Trump stooge who doesn't care about the environment.
Congrats to a man with good "horse sense"!
This would have been WAY cooler if the horse had a single straight horn projecting from its forehead
@BretBaier @BSEEgov He is from Montana..  Love of horses, real men, not afraid to get dirty,  guns a way of life, I like it
I mocked this stunt, but upon further reflection, maybe he's heard about Metro @unsuckdcmetro
Me: Awesome!
Wife: Why?
Me: You wouldn't understand. You're a Yankee.
Wife: ....
Actually, by comparison, this may well be the most normal thing to happen in this Administration yet.
Talk about a show pony move.
thats a real cute horse: hopefully you'll think of how your horse would feel on a slaughter truck and stop it...
Can't say his transportation isn't environmentally friendly.
@jaketapper @BSEEgov ok, politics aside, that might be one of the coolest things I've seen this week.
@BretBaier @BSEEgov Very cool.
better to stomp protesters that way
we should put DeVos on one!
@BretBaier @BSEEgov New sheriff in town.
How much does that cost?
So police had to spend time devoted to him?
wonder how much that stunt cost us taxpayers!
A bit less than O vacation in Hawaii.
Ha! "I'll take showcase #2, Bob."
will he also set out to hunt for his lunch later on??
@jaketapper @BSEEgov oh isn't that cute. Whoz paying for special escorts, where horse be kept & who will babysit it, DUMB & DUMB
Ahh, it's a D.C. police horse. @byrdinator @jaketapper @BSEEgov
@exjon @BSEEgov Loving this.
