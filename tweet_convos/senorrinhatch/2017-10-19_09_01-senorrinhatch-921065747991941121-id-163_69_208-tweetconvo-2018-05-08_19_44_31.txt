Democrats have won 6 GOP-held seats in 2017. Republicans have won 0 Democratic seats.
GOP voters can no longer vote GOP. It’s too risky.
You have done it before in the years leading up to 1929, 1987, and 2008.  Maybe this time the result will be different, success.  Insanity.
So Youre doing flat/fair tax reform 4 ALL that pay taxes..gettin rid of ALL loopholes...NOT SCREWING THE MIDDLE CLASS...in any way..correct?
And by reform..I mean lowering everyones taxes & not raising them as the years go by..deregulate only 4 those bringing jobs back2 US

You had better pass a bunch of good legislation.
Lining your own pockets again. The only thing the GOP excels at.
If you want to send a undeniable message to Congress then I suggest the following: #DrainTheSwamp by: "No Incumbents Reelected In 2018/2020"
You just voted to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit... Where is the fiscal conservatism?
Hurry
Trickle down economics did not work then and it won’t work now. Workers need decent wages to be able to afford to buy things Corp sell.
I have extremely high med bills. My taxes will go up. Also my health ins will skyrocket as I have a preexisting cond, I get screwed twice.
And it will be the last thing you can do...before you go really deep down
Mr. Trump, you're no Ronald Reagan.
Republicans prostituting themselves again for their 1% owners at the expense of the people. Trickle down economics alive & well in the GOP.
Honestly, I’m sick of you and your self serving agenda.
Please just go away, This plan is more take from the poor give to the rich BS

you should start with passing laws to make congress accountable and live by same laws they pass to all including health & wages!
You keep saying that like you believe it. Or, rather, that you want us to. You won't even let the Dems in to voice concerns. Disgusting.
Old enough to remember - Reaganomics benefited the rich.  Still waiting for my benefits.
The OLD SHELL GAME! Not to mention in the next 5yrs  you'll be The Land of the Poor Indigent FOOLS for buying into this chicanery!!
WOW. Really hard sell, full court press. You must know tax reform (euphemistically speaking) is going to hurt the lower 99%. Yah for the 1%.
How does adding TRILLIONS to the deficit benefit America?!  You are bankrupting our future!
Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates and the rich paid more $ plus we had growth that helped everyone. History!
Maybe you're lying or stupid or both...two bills under Reagan in 82 & 84  constituted the biggest tax increase ever enacted during peacetime
What was economic growth after he killed inflation from Carter? Better than after Obama raised capital gains taxes for "fairness" or whatevr
In 1986 the top 10% had less than 30% of the wealth.  Now they have over 60%! This is due to @GOP trickle down policies.
But has total wealth increases? Is everyone better off now than then?  & . You want everyone poorer but more = instead of everyone richer
Yep, you're so smart you'd prefer 20% of $100 to 5% of $1,000.
A bigger pie for everyone to split beats a larger portion of a smaller pie.
What are you going to do really tell me what...
Watch these 3 DB's screw the middle class. Have ANY idea what earning a check is like? BUT they are ready to help the top 1%. 3 dumb GOP'S.
You people never learn History. You try the ole trickle down shit and it did not work. Trying to fuuck the middleclass 2 give 2 the rich
So sad #GOP doing #TaxReform without #TaxFairness . #taxcuts for the rich and major corporations. Paltry handouts to working class.
Corporate cash surplus at historic high.  Let's give them more.  Maybe that will work.
If you Want to benefit the Country stand up and correcto tour mistake, get him out!
No your not. It dies in the Senate.
Talk is Cheap,
If you want to send a undeniable message to Congress then I suggest the following: #DrainTheSwamp by: "No Incumbents Reelected In 2018/2020"
Back your president
In 2018 as we vote remember REPUBLICAN IGNORE PUERTO RICO & ELDERLY.  GOP voted to take away MEDICARE/MEDICAID & ignored PUERTO RICO  needs
Bs, dem's need to stop the morons!  Only for the rich!
Action speak louder than words. Do it!!!!
Do it.  It will be your undoing.  Just as #Trumpcare would have been if you could have passed it.  

#FlipTheHouse #FlipTheSenate
Poll after poll shows most Americans hate the Republicans and their fraudulent tax reform plan.
We're being ignored at this point.
Debunked- Hey 45 just lost 600 Million why are you leaving him in charge of money ?
Not if we can help it.
Yeah screw the middle class & make yourselves richer
Saying a lie over and over doesn't make it true.  Our legislative bodies need a complete reform too. "We're going to do it" 2018 is coming
Eat me.
No you will not
Vote Republicans out in November, they are looking after themselves not us.
It will benefit the Rich and screw the poor and middle class. Most people are not as dumb as you think. EXCEPTION: Trump supporters!
Your current proposal would increase the deficit and raises taxes on lots of folks in the middle class. No thanks.
no way it only helps the Rich ! And Donald J Trump the CLOWN  in the White House !
And the Reagan tax cut was so so GREAT!  Note the sarcasm!
Do it for your rich buddies or for the rest of us?
you sure better
Reagan raised taxes 11 times.
#BuildTheWall
#BuildTheWall #MAGA
Yes I hope so
Hope so and while you do something for a change, stick together, follow up on Hillary, uranium deal and all corruption
#TrumpTaxReform must not include top rate reductions or #EstateTaxRepeal which will cause our debt to spiral. You forgot middle class again
Like you did "repeal and replace"?? BTW, what #BenedictMcCain or #FlakyFlake say about that? 
@realDonaldTrump
When will we get to Donald's tax returns, so we can see just how much "billionaires"Pay????
Make sure that corporations don't have loop holes to avoid paying their fair share.
Yahoo! Big WIN for your donors- top 1%.
No #TaxReform for the #DraftDodger @realDonaldTrump. He gave so little and he want more from the American People.
Complete Public Auditable Studies, not one a series
The Press and the Country want to know if it deserves attention.
Look at all those white, male 1%ers up there deciding tax policy that benefits them the most while the rest of us will see no change.
Here, fixed it for you. "#TaxReform: 'We're going to do it for the 1%." #utpol
And it will cause the House to flip next year. Middle class gonna be pissed! We’re getting screwed.
Only if u got the votes. Do you? Someone better know or this ship is going down...
Gerrymandering, vote supression, outright lies.. and  we're going to vote your asses right out of government.
Republican constituents will get screwed but than you never cared about them in the 1st place. You only care about the 1% & the rich donors
Stealing money from the middle and low income to make the rich richer is a scam. Taking money away from Medicare to fund your scam is cruel.
Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates and the rich paid more $ plus we had growth that helped everyone. History!
Labor participation and the economy is healthy, but income inequality increases because of this trustifarian myth disguised as theory.
And After Reagan destroyed the economy he had to raise taxes back up.  Republicans never learn from history.
Um no. Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates and the rich paid more $ plus we had growth that helped everyone. That's history.

It's NOT tax reform-it's tax cuts to the rich-Stop lying!!
How many times did Reagan have to up taxes because his cuts raised the deficit so much?? #CorruptGOP
@SenatGop @HouseGOP @ggeett37aaa @TomiLahren @seanhannity @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  @trish_regan @SpecialReport @TeamCavuto  implement Hr25
Y'all are creeps!
Perhaps @SenateGOP should read the responses to this tweet.  Bottom line, we don't believe you and we don't want it. Signed, the other 99%

AmericansAbroad deserve same rights as Americans living inUS.We're tired of being taxed twice,US&Country we live in!Repeal FATCA,FBAR,CBTAX
Sad
The only people happy

Sad sad day for america
Yep, you sure are working hard to screw middle and low income families.

Most of U.S. homes understand this IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR!
Not enough bipartisanship for anything to be good for U.S.
Understand?
Great another giveaway to the rich. Assclowns
No you're not, u said that about Healthcare 8 years worth and what do we have today, A big mess, @GOP can't govern.
Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates. The wealthy then paid more $ plus growth increased benefiting everyone. History!
And then, you're going to celebrate and congratulate each other.
And then We The People are going to get screwed over, to make your rich donor$ even richer.
You know it. We know it. And we know you're lying about it.
GOP: We are going to fuck over Americans AGAIN!
#TaxReform Yes, #Republicans are united in NOT repealing the Disabled Veterans Tax, S 66. Sad. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenJohnMcCain
We sincerely hope not! Unless it’s a bipartisan bill that is open for comment & doesn’t give a tax break to the rich, you can keep it!
What R vote no?  We want to know . We’re watching like never before
"benefit the American people" = the top 1% #GOPCorruption
great idea but GOP tax plans never help the middle class or the economy. The reason is (cont) http://tl.gd/no71aj 
Okie dokie. If you don't I won't vote you back in. @RepKevinBrady dont let district down. SALT will hurt..so I expect to see cuts elsewhere

A bogus #KillBill once again gain for the #Rich and All other Suffer! #KillTheBill @SenateDems @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins
you mean you're going to give tax breaks to the rich and make the poor pay the difference causing million to be more in financial ruin.
Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates and the rich paid more $ plus we had growth that helped everyone. History!
The question is who you gonna do it too And Regan trickle down economics never worked
No you won’t. Tax plan sucks and is full of lies and lies once again
The rich will be sooo pleased.
Should also read we have already failed you with GOPCARE by INCREASING COSTS TO YOU BY 30% Now we will TAKE YOUR MONEY GIVE TO RICH!!
wow, the group of leaders behind Reagan reminded me of how shabby the current group of "leaders" is. @SenateDems

I dont see how. Look at Kansas; economists have proven that that doesn't work. Youre helping your corporate friends by increasing our taxes.


I wouldn’t schedule the buses for your rose garden party yet! 
Theyll be out of luck. Most of the short bus fleet was mothballed after the inauguration. Assumed to never all be needed in same place again

Well, if you could do anything it would be to give millionaires and billionaires a huge tax break... #GOPRussiaCollusion #GOPTraitors
No! You will ruin low middle income!!!
Reagan would be rolling over in his grave considering Trump's cozying up to Putin... Today's GOP are not like Reagan at all.
You can't call it tax reform when it's tax cuts for the 1 percent of the total population !
Maybe you should read the full tax plan then lmao
That's what kids say when they want to put off mowing the lawn. "I'm going to do it." But they watch a video  and play WOW instead.
It is not the 1980's folks. It is a whole new world. Trying to apply job growth % from the past w/o the current technology is meaningless.

You had better GET with the presidents agenda or face the wrath of the  American people at the ballot box in 2018& beyond. Until you are
Gone and replaced with people who are willing to fight for the middle class and not themselves. People are the real power, not you.
"We're going to do it.”

At least you're clear that you're going to ram this down the taxpayers throats and shift money to the super rich.
Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates and the rich paid more & plus we had growth that helped everyone. History!


Except...you LIE!  #DrainTheSewer(YOU!) #LockYOUUp #MAGA
So by "American People" you actually mean the 1%
If only that statement dealt with #Removing the #Active #Ongoing threat that is #Erratic @realDonaldTrump.
#Congress has failed #America!
You must mean the largest theft of working class and middle class money for the benefit of ur billionaire overlords. 
#KochLies #MercerLies
Coolidge, JFK & Reagan all cut tax rates and the rich paid more $ plus we had growth that helped everyone. History!
Yup just like repeal and replace Obamacare
No.  We've proven that plan is shit.  Stop it!
