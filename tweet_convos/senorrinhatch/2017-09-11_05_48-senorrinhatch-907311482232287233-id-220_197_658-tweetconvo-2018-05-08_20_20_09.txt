If you don't get behind president trump. Get a new job come reelection time.
May God blessing the United States of America and the Americans always , AMEN !
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
But as @SenateMajLdr, McConnell reaffirmed he would be an obstructionist, no matter the cost to the American people, during Obama admin.
I am a Kentuckian and we will not reelect McConnell, if he pulls this do nothing but obstruction BS!!!
Simple and fair tax reform and focus on jobs, clown.
If you are rich and white. If not you will have them arrested and make a profit off of them with your $ interest in private prisons.
Actually Trump used 9/11 to brag that his building was now the tallest in Manhattan
and let's #NeverForget that Trump claimed that he personally cleared rubble from ground zero (he didn't)
And let us also #NeverForget that Trump used the 9/11 anniversary to call out the 'haters and the losers' and further dividing the country
McConnell better do something u going to get run over enough is enough

I can't tell by your politics
We'll never forget how terrible of a Senate majority leader you are. Get a clue and start calling out @realDonaldTrump for his racist rule!
I will to interpret things for you!
We will never forget #Benghazi 2012. RIP brave heroes. Amb Chris Stevens, Glen Doherty, Sean Smith,  Tyrone Woods

Mayo Clinic does not accept #ObamaCare. @SenJohnMcCain, like all his fellow Congressmen, is luckily exempt from the horrors of #ObamaCare. https://twitter.com/zimmaga/status/906873851815931905 …
#never forget #911truth @911news  what we will do is fight the battle until the end to shine the light of truth on what you & your buds did!
We never forget either....build the wall NOW !!!!
You already have.
Your comitment is shallow. If you really mean it, get the wall built so that we can truly secure our borders.
How would you know??
Meanwhile behind the scene McConnell pushes to Kill Americans for Profit ordering Lindsey Graham to get the votes to further defund ACA

If you mean this fund the wall! Make America safe again!!!
you have forgotten! What is playing out in USA CLEARLY shows a generation that have forgotten!
We will NEVER FORGET !
Clown conn
We will never forget that you and the senate FAILED to pass repeal and replace ACA. How many more failures are we expecting from you?
#neverforget how you tried to take Medicare away from millions of people. With an all GOP Congress couldn't even do it! 
Also we will never forget your obstruction and disservice to this country. Your legacy will forever be tainted thanks to @realDonaldTrump
You are better off forgotten. 9/11 however... Never forget.
Ldr. McConnell, why don't you jus resign And get out of the way of a POTUS who knows what to do and when to do it. You are a lame excuse ldr
Resign.

Mitch please retire!! You are embarrassment to the GOP
U r fake.
We'll also never forget that Jon Stewart had to shame Congress into passing legislation to insure the medical care of first responders.#GOP

NEVER FORGET!
You have forgotten how to lead and support our President! You are part of the "swamp" that needs to be drained!
BUILD THE WALL! Drain the swamp!
We won't forget this either.... National debt just exceeded $20,000,000,000,000.00. Tragic.
And you'll never work for the American people as you were voted in for either
RINO
#DrainTheSwamp resign
Go away
You got your head so far up the swamp that you wouldn't know how to keep a promise to the American people if it bit you in the back side
Hey McConnell we the people will always not forget that Obamacare is unconstitutional

Agree.
#worstresponder
Okay, remember 9-11-01. Almost lost a step daughter who worked there but my life destroying day was 6-27-01 when my son died but I can't say
You promised repeal and replace. You lied
Enjoy your final term.
Too much bad happened on your watch, you and your fellow senators are politically impotent
You definitely forgot the promise to the Trump agenda that you made to the voters
Time for you to step down.
SAVE THE FALLEN....REBUILD & RECOVER!
we will not forget it was the Republican party that failed in safe guarding our country that lead to the 9/11 attacks. #TRUTH
AND AS A NATION WE VOW TO NEVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE A TRAITOR WORKING TO LINE YOUR OWN POCKETS RATHER THAN WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE.
You are all talk. If you really want to honor Americans - get onboard with the Trump agenda and give this country back to the people!
Hopefully we can all forget 2016 and our ignorant dangerous @POTUS backed by @GOP #wheresthewomenmitch

I spit on you.
You & @SpeakerRyan Have clearly been against Trump from day one. Which means you're against America. Damn you both for no leadership skills
How dare you use this day to prop yourself up.
Never Forget? 
You've forgotten what makes this nation great.
The people, not the money
YEA just resign..mr irrevelant
OH QUIT MASTURBATING WITH THE FLAG AND GET US ALL HEALTHCARE.
Seems like you're forgetting. Get immigration reform done for the safety and security of Americans new and old!
#DrainTheSwamp starting with yourself~
Thanks for nothing Mitchy!
Mitch - if you are a true patriot, enact term limits. Step down and let new leaders rise up.  America needs new leadership #AmericaFirst
McConnell, how about getting to work for the American people, stop whining, pop the whip & SUPPORT President Trump. YOUR JOB!!
Remember the promise to repeal obama care root and branch? YOU ARE A LIER AND NEED TO BE REPEALLED! YOU FAILED US!
Don't forget  okay
How does selling the GOP to Russia for some rubles keep your promise to America? Please DO EXPLAIN.
In less corrupt countries, McConnell would be looking at possible jail time. http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/mcconnell-shrugs-off-trump-russian-leak-as-drama-and-distraction_us_591b12d4e4b0809be1585269 … #corrupt #TeamTreason

Hurricane Jose's center is moving away from the Caribbean islands devastated by Irma, National Hurricane Center says http://cbsn.ws/2eNYAqe  
You need to remember this no Amnesty for DACA
McConnell, you are far more dangerous to democracy than terrorism is. You continually FAIL in your DUTY to act as a check on the president.
You can't even affirm your promise to repeal and replace #obamacare. Why should we believe ANYTHING you say?
Because he knows it would be the death of the Republican Party. He just keeps repeating the gimmick for gullible GOPers, jobs, taxes, fear.
DRAIN THE SWAMP 
.@SenateMajLdr FYI; The term #NeverForget originates from the #Holocaust, which the #GOP has apparently forgotten.
#NazisAreNotGoodPeople
So Jews have trademark rights on victimhood? But we are trying to remember through #Holocaust research if that's okay #Holodomor #Bolsheviks
Nice try. 
#ConspiracyTheorist 
#FakeHistory
You're NOT a leader! You hate Pres Trump & therefore you hate America! Can't wait till all u traitors are gone!
Hey Mitch, can you remember what it is you are not going to forget?
.@SenateMajLdr we will never forget GOP's ongoing efforts to erode civil liberties and the fake "war on terror" blind to white extremists.
"Remember the Maine"
"Remember the Alamo"
We sure have a lot to remember!
Try not to use a Day of Heroes to pretend you aren't a Traitor to this Nation. #DrainTheSwamp #BuildersGuild
#BitchMitchMcConnell #LyinPaulRyan #DrainTheSwamp
Hope all republicans remember their promise s
If you cannot do your job let someone like @tedcruz do it for you. You cannot bring the Senate together to much of anything.
You are a do noting legislator-awful! Tax reform better be done in the next two weeks & repeal of Ocare. @tedcruz -please lead the senate.
Have another vote to repeal OBAMACARE this week! You are a weak leader. McCain would have voted for repeal if you done more per McCain.
WHEN DID YOU START TO GIVE A SHIT? 
http://pjunkie1.blogspot.com 
Your promises are very shallow
Time for you to go! Need someone else in charge.
American people will never forget how you obstructed @realDonaldTrump
https://youtu.be/Uz_UWVqgTdg  Amen!
We won't either @SenateMajLdr #Vote2018
Start by not obstructing our Presidents promises to the voters.

DITCH MITCH

And we will #NeverForget that YOU, Mitch voted AGAINST #september11 First Responders!
you, republican and Trump already forgotten that almost Saudis terrorist on the planes ... Trump sells more weapon to the Saudis !!
RESIGN
You voted against the 9/11 Bill to help aid first responders, that about as unamerican as they come
You forgot about your constituents a long time ago.
Then have the same courage as the first responders and pass the presidents agenda. Do your job
We will never "forget" you are letting @POTUS and the American people down. Your legacy so far 2/3 of Trump's nominees not been confirmed

Hey Mitch, well you reaffirm your promise and #RepealObamacare and the other promises we are waiting on...
Totally agree. Sincere condolences to all those who lost family & friends. Thanks to those who are HEROES in saving so many & rebuilding.
We overcome. We're strong. We will never forget
You are the worst for US.  You are terrorizing our unity and democracy.
Yet you vote to sell weapons to the Saudis, who furnished most of the murderers. What could possibly go wrong?
Yes, we'll never forget 9-11 or the lousy job ur doing to help the ppls agenda!
UR NOT part of this Nation! UR a traitor 2 our country & we will get rid of U&Ryan! UR worse then the dims! NeverTrumpYourselvesOutOfOffice!
Then why do  you endorse the Muslim Invasion and refuse to secure our borders? I go thr more security at airport thn illegals do at  border.
where is healthcare? My family still has none.McCain seems to have great coverage,Bet you do to.Disgusting Americans suffer
You cause 9/11 with your war monger republicans killers of humanity. Lock them up for treason with Russian money laundering
Unbelievable the comments on here.  Show some respect.  Today is not about you!
You dishonor our Great Nation & 9/11 victims every day by working against our President! #DrainTheSwamp #DitchMitch
How aboit you do what MOST Americans want you to do @SenateMajLdr? Saudi gov allegedly funded a 'dry run' for 9/11
And we will never forget you
Build up our military... Build our wall... put actions to your words
The wall is not a smart idea. The money is better spent on other forms of border security
Thank you Leader McConnell for your years of dedicated service to our country...I love you
Don't forget #PatriotAct #opiumepidemic
Drain the Swamp!!!!
Too bad we didn't learn from this , we still hold hands and dance w/ Saudi Arabia , we still send men to kill die for $$$. & Fix nothing.
#September11th #911remembrance #Hero
I will never forget 9/11 as well as the treasonous RINOs like yourself trying to nullify the election. RESIGN NOW LIAR!
Then do your job and order a blue ribbon investigative team to do a REAL investigation? There are WAR CRIMINALS in our Government?
Poll: Do-nothing Ryan-McConnell Congressional leadership support down to 15 percent - NetRight Daily
I'll never forget the controlled explosions that killed so many that didn't have to die !!
Never forget President Obama took care of bin laden.Not w. President Obama.The guy u treated like shit? We will never forget that #McTraitor
Not comforting coming from a man who in less than 1 yr forgot what Democracy is, as he pledged his allegiance to trump over our Country
But let's not talk about the 15 Saudis in that group because we need to sell more of our advanced weapons to that country.
And we'll never forget the shitty job you've done.
Cut the bullshit today please. Everyday people divide this country further, please give it a rest today.
WHEN WILL A DAY COME WHEN LUNATICS WANT OUR HISTORY'S 911 MEMORIAL SCRUBBED FROM SITE AND MIND LIKE OTHER WAR STATUES DIBLASIO THE FOOL
Talk about reaffirming promises, let's pass tax reform.
Are you going to trim down the victims list to exclude any undocumented folks now?? Probably-that's how the @GOP & @POTUS likes to roll.
Worry about American car companies sharing taxpayer funded technology with hostile China
Lol well put.


I'll believe you stand for the USA when you begin to stand behind the President!
Build the wall, Mitch!
Need to resign. #TrumpRussiaCoverUp needs to be exposed. You took money from the Russians?! You are part of this corruption. RESIGN NOW.
You have no concept of the definition of the word "PROMISE"!
Trump lied that thousands of people cheered as the towers came down. This lying hater is now our president.
Listen to Trump brag on 9/11 that his building was now the tallest. http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/09/11/listen_to_trump_brag_on_9_11_that_his_building_was_now_the_tallest.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top … via @slate




Yet you fail the people by your actions everyday by your rebellion against our Presidents & We the people by your no votes.  God help us all
THEN RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE POOREST TO AT LEAST $10.10HR. WE NEED THEM TO BE PART OF SOCIETY AND ECONOMY!
Drain the swamp
Let's hope so. Like we'll "never forget" WW2 and the rise of Nazism? We'll see...
Socialism and communism is pure evil
While you and @GOP fucked over every responders that helped with the rescue and clean up at the WTC-site... #NeverForget
By doing nothing about a President who is beholden to Russia you have forgotten. You are unAmerican. #NeverForget #ImpeachTrump #RussiaGate
Time for the @GOP to act then. The #TrumpRussia coverup must end. Your oath say you will protect America from enemies foreign and domestic
Resign from leadership.
You have failed all Americans.
Jowls.
