Be AGAINST Trumpcare. Be FOR Single Payer. Do those things, and you've got my vote. I don't want to hear arguing. You need to CONVINCE me.
I like your style, WE NEED MORE OF YOU! no debate needed, clear as climate change. no argue/promise, JUST DO IT! SINGLE-PAYER, CONVINCE US!
Likewise, let's keep it coming and make them know!!
thanks 4 follow, more voices=more ideas. UNITY=POWER! I'm disabled, so I keep my follows 2 around 200 2 keep timeline manageable. had space
Well, I'm happy you did, and likewise thank you :) let's unite, my friend.
It's a shame you didn't stand united to bring #Otto home. Democrats kill people, but they'll send Iran pallets of cash all day long.
Sorry, but it true. All true.
Standing against a bill you claim to have not seen?
Thank you from all michigan families that know what's right!
For our NAS newborns who will become ineligible for care under AHCA: #holdthefloor!
Support from Shell, here!! TY
All you Democrats is to line your pockets you don't give a crap about the people!
jerks
@SenStabenow No disrespect but nursing home care for any type of long term care need is not covered by ANY insurance. It is out of pocket.
There Will Be A Senior Revolt! No one should be forced to lose everything they own, their legacy, to cover for- profit senior care!
Unfortunately this has always been this way with long term care nursing home coverage.
"we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it"
THANK YOU
Impeach Trump guilty. Treasonous,  just like Republicans.
This is why you lose elections. Always stonewalling and lying.
I am there with you LIVE
I am there with you live from my livingroom
Where I hope to continue to #Live
Dear @GOP please allow me to LIVE

#ACA saved my life. #AHCA might take it.
My #WBC counts for 2 years

And thank you for calling it Trumpcare. If it's passed, people will be hurt and they'll know who to blame.
Thank you for representing Americans! The points being made should break hearts of any R's that have them. They are the party of disgrace

I'm glad to know I don't have to beg my Senators @Peters4Michigan & @SenStabenow to vote #NoAHCA. They know how dangerous it is.
Could @SenateMajLdr McConnell look any worse?! @SenateDems clearly stating case abt extreme break in Senate procedures, @SenateGOP looks BAD
Healthcare is a basic human right.
No-it's a responsibility.
The better the human the more responsibility they feel about caring for the rest.
R govt has weak excuses 4 humans
I'm watching you showboats doing a dance to entertain your base. You may be "live" now but you're killing your party. @GOP @MIGOP
Hold their feet to the fire! Peoples lives depend on it!!!
Thanks and I appreciate your efforts, but I doubt it will help.
THANK YOU!! We're standing with you! Keep going!
Work together for the People!!!
you MUST object everytime the #GroupiesOfPutin bring anything to the floor. Just like lying Mitch McConnell did today.
THANK YOU
#holdthefloor by reading the entire gulag archipelago  #resist

They don't even know what is In it. Just like Obama care which most of them voted for
The ones that havnt been voted out yet because of it
Obstructionist how soon they forget why they lost big
About time dems stood up against this smash and grab of 1/6 of our economy by republicans. #SaveOurHealthcare
Please save our US friends' healthcare. #Obamacare saves lives, #Trumpcare is an oxymoron.  #FilibusterByAmendment #Resist #StandTogether. 
make us proud!!!!
The protest has already started without even knowing what's going to happen. This is no way to lead a country!!
Dems dont care about people - they abuse the American taxpayer
Must win over 3 sane republicans. Collins? Gardner? Murkowski? McCain? Perhaps wont be cruel enough for Cruz, Lee or Paul.
McCain is first and foremost a Republican. He will vote for it no matter what.
Don't try to help make a better system, just resist. Beautiful, just fucking beautiful.
THANK YOU for standing up for US and not just the billionaires!
FIX- F.D.A. - I WAS NEVER SICK TILL BAD DRUGS I STILL SUFFER FOR... FIX THE F.D.A. WHO DID NOT HELP ME. NOT 1 DEMOCRAT OR REBPULBICAN , NOT!
Implement vote orama with 40,000 amendments. Best solution to this crisis
TRUMPCARE OR OBAMACARE ---- NO! FINES! ----FOR ANYONE WHO DOESNT WANT... NONE... INSURANCE WAS MORE THAN I MADE,SO DIDN GET-FIX FDA- FIRST!!
You are on life support.
USA wants *YOUR* Congressional health plan - looks a *LOT* like the AHCA that you oppose.

If #Trumpcare were better than O'care, wouldn't @GOP be forthcoming and open about it, flaunting its benefits? Secrecy is deviousness.
Keep going with that. Please!
@SenStabenow have you read it this time or just allow big pharma to?
You need to pull out all the stops. If aren't going to fight as hard as you can on this what will you fight for?
Thank goodness that Obamacare has been so effective. If you are referring to slamming everyone with lost coverage and massive premium hikes.
You're against everything but contribute nothing.
LETS GET OUR FIX ACA MARCHES GOING.
Stay strong! 23 million are depending on you!
Give them hell! Fight like lives depend on it! They do! Your children , your grandchildren and your spouses.
Thank you! Together we Rise!
Go @SenStabenow !! Watching you on @MSNBC , you are explaining perfectly why we need hearimgs!!!
Thank you! Do whatever it takes to stop this disgusting bill!
I have stage four cancer and am watching this with great concern. Please help us keep our healthcare.
