FakeNews
Republicans didn't, Trump did, get your disinformation right. Trump made them pull it.
Bigger fish must come first.
is there a "bigger fish" than the check and balance system and the unbiased security of which within our government?
Start with clean-up of obama care, seat federal judges, find and kill terrorists who have killed our people.
if the states were abiding by the Medicaid restrictions, the premiums wouldn't have risen regarding PPACA
I suppose States' Rights got in the way a bit. I guess the ? is, were they consulted in advance.
my question is: is consultation more important than their citizens access to healthcare?
Don't want to debate what ifs, might have beens. It was Socialist endeavor doomed to fail. More nxt tweet.
YEAH THE SWAMP WILL BE DRAINED OF CORRUPT DIMMOCRATS WHO ARE PUSHING FALSE PATRIOTISIM JFK 2 SDD
@SenateDems #WeDemandINVESTIGATION@cnn #WeDemandINVESTIGATIONGOP #WeDemandINVESTIGATIONTrump #TrumpLeaks
@SenSchumer Hard to believe anything the corrupt liars of the democratic party have to say!! Lost me....
@SenateDems They filled it and now it's so full of crap.  Pray the democrats fight for us! You are the only hope we have!
@SenateDems stop defending Obamacare. We had 3 elections where the American people said NO to Obamacare
I'd be ashamed of even mentioning the word ''ethics'' after America watching Hillary lie with her every breathe.Crook !!
limit senate terms to 2 terms! DTS!
@SenateDems Why do you guys care? You're the most unethical moral cowards in DC. Please sit down, be quiet & let adults work.
You democrats are the ones that are unbelievable-just look at election. #MAGA #TrumpTrain
@SenateDems this is not correct so they can mess up oh man if it had been HILLARY wow they'd have a baby
and the Repuke higher ups Ryan& company tried to gut it! People calling their representatives helped stopped this& republicans 2
why is that? No one watchdog over them let them do whatever please
well your mind doesn't work to well
Nancy Pelosi promised to drain the swamp, then Charlie Rangel forgot to pay his taxes, some of us have long memories.
@SenateDems
I believe you have nailed it!
@SenSchumer do all of you not realize the Rank and File see you as the Swamp. You forgot us and as a result you have Trump.
@SenateDems obama started draining  it!  1000 plus Democrats out of a job!! In 8 years too! 
Add that to his legacy! Hahahahaha
Maybe they mixed up they're sayings... Drain the Swamp to them meant down the drain.
Bring to ur state. Your on the wrong side. If you get in Trumps way, we can give you a bigger minority in 2018. Believe 11/8/16
Did u miss the memo? Trump is bailing out ur state by getting Ford to bring jobs to MI. Who r u fighting? What jobd did you
Trump promised to drain the swamp, congressional GOP members tried to "gut" the ethics office. Trump stopped them.
No, Trump wants to drain the swamp, that's why the GOP is so against him.
Leftist ideology just smacked into a brick wall.
The universities and media should be drained as well.
I must have missed your righteous indignation in 2010 when it was your party doing the "unbelievable"
Looks like Trump (shockingly) shamed them, but we mustn't let up.
@SenSchumer   THE SECRECY IS ABHORRENT.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
I would like tic u go down the swamp drain!!!
Like you and your party know anything about ethics.  Ask Hill.  Maybe she can explain what they are.
Drain the Swamp & Cut the heads off the snakes, make purses out of the Alligators. Jan,20th
@SenateDems not do fast there Debbie!  Trump just corrected that, and by the end of his first term you'll be a Republican!
@SenSchumer Pres Trump did something presidential & called for this to be disbanded So where were Dems w/Obama's overreach. Hmm
A hidden cat box still stinks
Time to scoop out the box
Maybe a little air freshener for the voters?
#theresistence

One slight correction to your statement...DJT promised to "drain the swamp", not the republicans...words matter
The republicans ARE the swamp. #DTS
@SenSchumer  I agree that the OCE should stay as in its original initiated form.
Then please do something to stop this man. How can the regular citizen help?
It seems to me the whole system is corrupt. Trump is corrupt, House and Senate is corrupt. Please stand up for good ethics!
LIke the ethics of Hillary?  Nice choice, idiot.
STOP THE "SNARKY" CRAP AND TRY TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE BUSINESS OF WHAT IS NEEDED FOR AMERICA--NOT YOUR PARTY
# Your right again they have been relegated to the bus for so long now they dont know how to act.
@SenateDems it is outrageous!

@SenateDems we have been unbelieving since @realDonaldTrump took to the candidate stage. Wake up and show some leadership!
makes perfect sense. Independently most of them have no ethics.
@SenateDems Yes this is bad. Not a good start right out of the gate.  We need you to fight for us Senator!
Partisan Hack!!! #Junk #Useless
President-elect Trump has said he disagrees with these changes, you better change your position, you can't agree with him!
@SenateDems. Debs, you sound worried.  I mean, I already condemned the move.
@SenateDems some republicans and some democrats are the swamp; @realDonaldTrump has to follow through and clean it up, drain it

Thank you for your outrage, Senator. Please continue to fight for our democracy.
