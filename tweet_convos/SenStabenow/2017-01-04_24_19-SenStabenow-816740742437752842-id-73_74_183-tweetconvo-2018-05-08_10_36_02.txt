@SenSchumer I have two words for all of you elitist political hacks........TERM LIMITS. Americans deserve honesty
@SenSchumer Did the Congress exempt themselves from obamacare
DEMOCRATS....
WANT TO CONTINUE SCREWING
AMERICANS AGAIN!
WITH THE UNAFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE PLAN
KNOWN AS OBAMACARE
I am sick, sick of the f***'n Democrats and their bullshit!
Increase competition. Allow insurers to compete across state lines and tort reform.
Richard, doctors, nurses, hospitals, medical mfg, insurance companies, drug companies deserve to make a profit.
We the people cannot afford OBAMACARE unlike you guys who are exempted from it.
@SenSchumer if they gut the healthcare system-republicans guts the Americans souls that use it.
Stand up and be strong, the country and democracy needs you
just sit down and shut up and watch @realDonaldTrump work his magic...then go sit in a corner and lick your pride!
why your just going to make shit up and lie,people are on to you dems
@SenSchumer even better watch how Americans vote out those on the right and left who do not work constructively for the USA.
To do away with a health care system which was passed by Dems only. 

And Dems who LOCKED Repubs out of committee conferences.
And Dems who started losing their seats due to anger from voters who have been given the finger  by Dems.
Praying the Republicans gut the ACA. Chances are it won't be a gut.#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Stabenow take care of your Michigan people, who can afford these rates? Give us yours and you take ours? DTS
as a former Dem-you just don't get it as usual. Senator "no" won't last long--
In a race to roll out OCare you launched a nightmare. Your irresponsibly is APPALLING! Is 4800 > a year acceptable? Uh NO!
@SenSchumer #clueless and out of touch. #ACASucks
Are u on obamacare? If it's so great why aren't all u dems covered by it? Y'all sit up in DC n look down on the taxpayers believe u too good

@SenSchumer These people will change their tune when they lose their healthcare or the parts of ACA that benefitted them
Wait till @realDonaldTrump campaigns against @SenStabenow in 2 years.  Michigan loves Trump.  Bye-bye Debbie.  #MakeAmericaSickAgain #MAGA
@SenSchumer
Wow all you liberals are in denial....
U guys are about as stupid as it comes. the working people put u there and you betray them by your  fn socialism
u don't care for average American. ACA isn't affordable! It's massively destructive. You're paid to work for US not do harm!
@realdonaldtrump ACA is NOT our health care system it belongs to dems who shoved it down our throats.
Why should I watch or listen to your BS??
In preserving and improving ACA, be sure to point out this is a PROTECTION! That is an important concept.
@SenSchumer the only ones benefiting from Obamacare are the folks at poverty level or right above it, you are screwing us...
Thank you, @SenStabenow - keep fighting for us! #ACAworks #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@SenSchumer
after explaining that Obamacare literally saves this guy's life, and charges him $0, he still doesn't like it because: 
stop blaming each other and work together! You people are fools!
@SenSchumer bull sht
@SenSchumer I'm sure you are all getting kick backs for this bad program! All of you should have to get your coverage from ACA!
Senator, you can give all the statistics you want to fabricate, but America is not healthier under #Obamacare. #Truth
and your stats are better and you know this how?
I am a physician and I actually take care of patients who can't afford their health insurance under #Obamacare. UnlikeU
Get a clue..talk to your constituents before spouting party BS.
she doesn't care about the constitutes, only the Democrat party.
You passed it and it is failing. Your fault.  So get to the back of the bus like Obama told the GOP.  Adults are in charge.
@SenSchumer The Dems are all sourpusses they don't want Americans to have affordable health care..
just turned it off don't need to listen to grandstanding and falsehoods #MAGA
no thanks we heard enough stupidity from schemer
@SenSchumer never mind all the ones who lost ins. because of obamacare.
Awful speech- totally out of touch
@SenSchumer you are sicko to say repubs want to make America sick. Obamacare sick and on hospice... Almost dead... Scrap it!
Great, catchy poster and very true. Excellent so far.
@SenSchumer is this @SpeakerRyan survey legit? Will it do any good?
Debbie, how about you and Chuck REQUIRE Congress & families to utilize ObamaCare first?
@SenSchumer PEOTUS is risking our national security with this insane tweets. Nothing is more important than stopping him.
Senator Stabenow your 2018 reelection is coming fast. DRAIN THE SWAMP!
if you and your comrades would have done a better job in the 1st place there would be no reason to revisit Obamacare #failure
Guess what @jeffclark2112 ?
The ACA is Romney's plan and the only one the Repubs would consider passing. Don't blame the Dems. @SenStabenow
not 1 Republican voted for it, it was passed by all Dems
