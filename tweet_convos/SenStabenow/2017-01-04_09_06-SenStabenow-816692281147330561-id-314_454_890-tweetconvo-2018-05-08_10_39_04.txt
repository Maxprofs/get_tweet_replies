@SenSchumer If you had allowed input from Repubs in the first place we wouldn't have this Obamacare train wreck today.
Republicans have wanted to repeal it not replace it.  You think the GOP will have something cheaper?
Yes. Multiple viewpoints always yield a better decision
So Trump who has all millionaires and billionaires in his cabinet will provide afforable health care?
Change is going to be driven from the House/Senate. As for million/billionaires there are plenty on the Dem side: Tech, Media etc
The Dems don't have a Cabinet, Trump won, and you know who controls that House and Senate.
You two are such schmucks. ObamaCare is a disaster, high costs, limited treatments, refusals. 
WAKE THE HELL UP.
Yeah, when we had good old insurance and just got kicked off of it when we got sick that was much better
Then you are a fool, staying with a shitty insurance company.
They all did that, that was one of the reasons for the ACA.
You're what schmucks like Schumer refer to as "a useful idiot"
You have not "Read" it either , Kill it NOW !
What is the republican plan to replace it?
Bring your own , , ,
In not the words, nothing.
If you like it , 
You can keep it , Quote, Unquote, Some of us are paying 2k per month, 6k deductible , per year , ,
You have NO clue since you are exempt; It needs repealed & start over for everyone's benefit even yours U need to use it
But before it is repealed you need a plan, there is no plan to replace it at this point.
Don't worry..It's on it's way
Nothing out there yet. A repeal would mean 30m people with no health insurance.
Ya think so? There are more than that w/out cause they can't afford it !!!
@SenSchumer stop fighting like babies, get to work!!
before ACA majority of the people couldn't get affordable insurance.
a majority of people had health insurance before Obama care.
If that the case, why didn't Republicans work to improve healthcare for all Americans.
First Chance the Democrats had, they screwed up the Healthcare systm.  This is all on the Dems!
all Democrats to improve American life, all republicans to screw the poor & middle class
You forget it takes time for legislation to work. most of the screwups were legislated by Democrats and Inherited by Republicans
President Bush is a republican. When he left office we were in a recession.
@SenSchumer now you gwt to taste your own medicine. Hahaha, how do you like your tactics being used against you?
@SenSchumer JOKE.
Really? If Obamacare is so great, why doesn't the democrats in congress use it? Is Obama using it?
So you want to take health care from your republican neighbors? They use it most. Or u just sheltered w no pre conditions
Republicans want better healthcare & lower premiums for all Americans. Democrats rave on Obamacare & won't use it themselves
what's sick is paying a premium as much as a house payment
you are a fraud.
Socialist, progressive communists standing together destroyed healthcare for millions. DEMOCRATS MADE AMERICA SICK
@SenSchumer 
U make me sick. ACA has further ruined an already broken healthcare system. Time for fresh ideas #TRUMP #MAGA

U know nothing about it. It you repeat propaganda. Ask your neighbors who need it. Most folks using ACA are republicans
@SenSchumer Despicable

@SenSchumer dems eager to pass blame to reps to wash their hands like JUDAS
#GoTrumpGo #USA #KillObamacare
Obama made us pay to make America sick. We are still paying. I tried Obamacare, it was expensive and crappy.
Looking forward to all of you failing together, soon.
We are already sick of double digit increases, high deductibles, lost our doctors. It is only getting worse.
@SenSchumer right even @billclinton said it wasn't worth anything you damn democrats signed documents you never read
@zotan220
Did you even read the bill before you voted on it years ago?
@SenSchumer Dem get heads out of Obama's butt y'all already loop holed over 100,000 retired auto workers loss Thier coverage
How SICK is this picture, a pile of Blood sucking Democtrat leaders behind a sign that clearly depicts their agenda
My heart says fight to keep 4 those who need, but GOP vilified & they should face their voters after cut
@SenSchumer you obviously don't have Obama care..
Actually, the dems do not stand for the middle class.We cannot afford the "UNaffordable care act": #repealobamacare
@SenSchumer Why don't you sign up for it?American people shouldn't be paying for YOUR healthcare when we can't afford ours.
I have never seen such liars in my life as Democrats. They lose then want control. IDIOTS
What a pathetic lot...your corrupt party has become!!
#AMEN!!!
Great, and please investigate the newly released electoral college report. #TheResistance 
 http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/least-50-trump-electors-were-illegitimately-seated-electoral-college-members …
My rates are 900 month w/ 12k deductable and 1 plan. Keep my Dr.? NO Keep my plan? NO! ACA is a LIE & will get worse!
@SenSchumer Wow! Put a whole lot of thought into that artwork didn't you? Almost as catchy as Podesta's #RussianHackersDidIt
@Mama3Cubs tell Republicans to set an example and give up their healthcare.Tell them to shop around for insurance

Crooks, all of you.
@SenSchumer awwww you colored a poster
Yea DC believes they're too good for obamacare that us little Minions should jump for joy that they've found another way to steal our money.
@SenSchumer Good. Stand real close together so it makes it a lot easier to vote collectively against the Dems in 2018
@SenSchumer Say bye bye to Obamacare! My  healthcare premium is as high as my mortgage payment thanks to Obamacare

@sheilad715 keep fighting. GOP did not get a mandate.
Because you can trust us:  And, "If you like your plan, you can keep it!"
You don’t get out of Washington much to see how it is in the real world do you?
Amazing how so many hate the ACA and Hilary wanted to improve it but they voted for Trump who has no plan at all.
couldnt trust hillary to do anything. Alternative was better
more of Dem bs hypocrites
The election is over, Debbie. Trump won. lol
If you only knew how many Americans are laughing at y'all right now. Y'all are so pathetic. The election taught you nothing.
You're completely delusional and have nothing to offer the Economically literate.
@SenSchumer a fancy slogan doesnt cover up the hi cost of Healthcare & increased deductibles. #makeamericapooragain is ur motto
@SenSchumer you people sound like fools!
@SenSchumer why don't you make it mandatory for all politicians to have to use the unaffordable care act. Then I would shut up
Since so many care only about themselves, Dems should remind people the Act removed lifetime caps, surcharges for women, etc
@SenSchumer thank you Dems stand strong !!
Before ACA it costed me $250, and $500 for child #2 and #3. Post ACA, child #4 has cost me over 9K out of pocket w/insurance...
Are either of you using/insured by ObamaCare? If not, why not?#MakeHealthcareAffordable Again
Public can't compete with money & influence wheeled by lobby firms. corruption & HC disaster is the result
My guess is that you are one of the corrupt! You among other  officials own the Flint water disaster, fix the water hypocrite!
@SenSchumer honestly place "repealing O'care will" before the # slogan on the sign otherwise it looks like you want this
Standing with you.
where are Trump's tax returns? What do they hide? majority of voters rejected Trump.  Not the minority.
Now we know which side has death panels.  Republicans would repeal and replace with...zip
America is already #Sick! #SickOfObamaCare!!!!! #ByeByeObamacare!!!
Half of the country wants something different!! ARE YOU  NOT LISTENING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
@SenSchumer Goodbye to the biggest failure of the Obama administration, Obamacare
Is this all of you? #Hacks
how is it protecting my sis as she just dropped insurance? First time in 34 years she hasn't been insured. $12k damn deductible
@SenSchumer "double premiums, coverage cut in 1/2- craziest thing in the world" ~ Bill Clinton #maga #makeamericasickagain

@tates5a Please don't even bend. #RESIST
...nice catchy philandering phrase....too bad it won't get you anywhere
when you passed that piece of crap you made me a criminal. You cant come back from that.
You all are making America sick. Bring the costs down. You lack vision to bring real change and affordability.
Thank you and @KamalaHarris my new kick-ass Democratic Senator, standing next to and with @BernieSanders !

Medical error is now the #3 cause of death.  #ThanksObamacare
Bravo, Senator Schumer, for standing up to the sociopath!
Please!  Do not give any assistance to the @GOP re #Trumpcare.  Let them sink in their own cesspool.
As usual Democrats are standing against America.
obvious scam tweet....not the VP
@SenSchumer It's what Ayn Rand fans do & how they think.
@LibertyNews1776 you're the ones that screwed it up! #Dimwits
What will #MakeAmericaSickAgain is not having #TermLimits and getting rid of career politicians.
@SenSchumer Remember 8 years ago, we do. Sit back and deal with it. The adults are running the country now. #MAGA
At  WA rally Mr Trump said they would not just repeal w nothing 4 ppl .They said replace.Make them keep their word
Clearly you are not aware of the skyrocketing rates....affordable?  hardly! @cnn Work with @GOP to fix or replace
You made America sick under Obama now get out of the way and say yes sir President Trump
Congress has it's own Healthcare Why don't you try Obamacare and see how you like it IT SUCKS unless  you are poor
@SenSchumer WE REPUBS WANT BETTER COVERAGE THAN WHAT OBAMA GAVE & u think he's a Prince. Prince of hell maybe!
BULLSHIT!  Democrats once again demonstrate their utter stupidity and cluelessness  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@SenSchumer Do not let them repeal. Let's fix it add public option (better yet single payer).  Standing with you!
@SenSchumer How about all of those that you destroyed health care girl
@SenSchumer Where dies the Democratic Party get all the jack asses like you?
Getting kicked off your insurance when you got sick was better?

Thank you Senators. Fight them with every tool you have!
Keep fighting for us! We can't return to the days when being a woman was a pre-existing condition or lifetime insurance caps.
@SenSchumer you can't even come up with your own slogan.
Americans are standing together to remove all You communists posing as Americans. Thank god for Pres Trump!!
@SenSchumer Obamacare is a disaster.  The people have shown they want it replaced.  Your fake righteousness is evident to all.
@SenSchumer 
You are delusional if you think Americans will make healthy choices for themselves just because of free insurance.
@SenSchumer Like 6 yrs ago,when u marched arm in arm, shoved ACA down r throats despite public opposition& 0 GOP votes? Repeal!
Pass a bill that doesnt affect you! Hypocrites. Won't vote Dem again for a long time. If ever again.
Schumer & anybody else bought by lobby firms have no credibility w/taxpayers. 500M spent to protect pvt HC ins co's
Your sign is correct, Obamacare TAX has made America sick.
This group as been making me sick for years. The antidote takes office very very soon..
