You, schummer and the like should be arrested and tried for encouraging riots.. if you don't agree vote against it.
19 radical Islamic terrorists changed lives of Americans 4 ever. Every voice is important. Protect our borders, enforce the law
Way to peacefully protest everything!!!!
STOP SESSIONS, STOP DEVOS, STOP EXXON 4 sos, STOP TRUMP Mi ganders have your back
enforce immigration laws, we have to have all documents in order to go to another country, why not the US?
Somehow more important that the majority that favor this EO to protect the American people.
Now the union teachers are at work in our children's classrooms, doing jobs the taxpayers pay them to do.
Thank you for looking out for the people of Michigan!
Refuse Senate procedure until the ban is lifted. #ShutItDown #resist
For what?? Hysteria perpetrated by fake news...
so biased, your constituents expect you to look at both sides #KeepAmericaSafe
You owe us strength and leadership - use ur power wisely.  No on all nominations.  #StopPresidentBannon #NoBanNoWall
Get over being a sore loser and get to work like @POTUS is!
Why did you vote YES on Rick Perry????
#withholdconsent stop Trump ....slow his agenda. .. #liftthemuslimban
need to get on with getting the government working.  Confirmation of the cabinet must be completed as soon as possible.
vote no on all nominees and vocally oppose Bannon appointment to NSC
thank you for speaking out against this ban on muslims.
thank you but we need you to fight on the inside. Vote NO!
you do realize that Obama did the same thing to Iraq for 6 months in 2011.  What was your reaction at that time?
thank you for protecting the dream that is America
Thank you. Please vote No for all his cabinet picks, especially DeVos. We saw what she did to Michigan children. Not qualified!
Thank you for your hard work!
I hope we hear from you Dems on the airways and media..we need to know you are all out there for us vote2018
This ! Well stated!
is my voice important? Or do you only represent your political party?
I'm glad it's making a difference.  Michigan democrats are behind you!  Stay strong!  Don't back down.
And PRESIDENT TRUMP carried Michigan
you spoke on this issue. Obama ban result of 2 bombers in KY, so 6 month ban warranted. Barring Syrians indefinitely? Not same
And what have you done for michigan? You and hussein obama turned it RED

why is your voice mail full x 3 days. You need to hear us. Stop Pres Bannon.
vote no on every nominee and DO NOT let his SC nominee through!!
thanks for your support, Senator! Please support us in return by voting NO on ALL trump's nominees.
