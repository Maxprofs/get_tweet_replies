@SenStabenow 
You have no issue with Iran self monitoring its military site? No, chance of cheating, none.  Terrible decision.
@wiscbadger3670 @SenStabenow the deal prevent all of that you mentioned. Please inform yourself of what you criticizing.
@faridsob @SenStabenow I'm informed that Iran gets to self monitor.  That's insane.  Aside from that, opening the money bags is plan stupid.
@wiscbadger3670 @SenStabenow that report was either an intentional or unchecked misleading report. They deleted it afterward. Their own $
@faridsob @SenStabenow regardless, you don't open up the world financial market to the top terrorism sponsor with nothing in return. #nodeal
@wiscbadger3670 @SenStabenow Iran is not so. That is just propaganda. Financially, Saudi is bigger of a sponsor.
@faridsob @wiscbadger3670 @SenStabenow So what do we get in return?  Are our 3 Americans going to be released at least?
@TsunamiDaisy @wiscbadger3670 @SenStabenow 1st, it wasn't about Iran vs. U.S. 2nd, they're suspected to be spies as we had previous cases.
@SenStabenow @joshrogin Here is my statement, "Anybody who supports the Iran deal is an idiot," it really is that simple.
@dwthompson1945 @SenStabenow @joshrogin i bet you haven't read the agreement. :))
@faridsob @SenStabenow @joshrogin You lose...
@dwthompson1945 @SenStabenow @joshrogin are you sure you read it? Or you just watched an Ad against it? Just wondering.
@faridsob @SenStabenow @joshrogin Its not just about nuclear bomb, its the "signing bonus" that will fund more terrorism, snap back not real
@faridsob @SenStabenow @joshrogin Why would we lift not just economic sanctions but arms embargo as well...insanity.
@dwthompson1945 @SenStabenow @joshrogin because it is illegal to sanction without a reason.
@faridsob @SenStabenow @joshrogin Isn't Iran sending rockets to Hamas "a reason" for you?
@SenStabenow @TheIranDeal Thank you Senator Stabenow. I'm sure #Michigan is keeping Amir in it's thoughts. <3
@sa1twat3r @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal Well its not like they're going to be able to throw a welcome home party now.
@Zaggs @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal ??confused??
@sa1twat3r @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal Iran is getting at least 50 billion sanctions relief, we couldn't demand 4 people back (12.5 bil per)?
@Zaggs @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal I do not know the circumstances regarding Amir's capture. But, Iran is a sovereign an will act as such.
@sa1twat3r @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal ...by sanctions to be allowed back on those systems if you're concerned about their sovereignty 2/2
@Zaggs @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal I'm not concerned at all. I just want to see this deal through. <3
@sa1twat3r @SenStabenow @TheIranDeal So you're keeping Amir in your thoughts by supporting a deal that keeps him over there.  Um, ok.
@SenStabenow @ezrateach. Wonderful commentary. Thank u for your concern and support for peaceful co-existance.
@SenStabenow This deal is a complete joke and you know it.
@SenStabenow Releasing 150 billion dollars to Iran is simply fools play! You need to seriously get the Pentagon to brief you on the truth!
@SenStabenow you and the other senators supporting this agreement are TRAITORS !!!!  THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENT WILL BE ON YOUR HANDS! #TCOT
@SenStabenow @joshrogin So you support giving tens of billions to a regime that you yourself say "dangerous regime that kidnaps Americans"?
@Zaggs @SenStabenow @joshrogin Israel is far more dangerous. It killed 500 kids last summer. It has nukes that it built in secret.
@richiefreddy @Zaggs @SenStabenow @joshrogin Yes, Israel is dangerous, they are terrorizing the world as we speak. LMAO.
@SenStabenow Senator Stabenow, thank you for supporting your President, your party, our country and our allies.
@SenStabenow WHAT YOU SAY IN YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT IRAN IS VERY, VERY LAME! You did not do H.W. You allowed self to convince you from talk!
@SenStabenow continue studying #Irandeal #IAEA neutered this not trust but verifyl it is the 1st of many nuclear extortion payments to Iran
@SenStabenow Do not be a Democratic party drone.  You are there to represent the people of Michigan, not your Democratic party cronies.
@SenStabenow The largest state sponsor of terrorism will self inspect their nukes, while holding US hostages & we give them $150 Billion?
@SenStabenow My family urges you to reconsider you Iran deal position. We have Iran by the balls now with sanctions! Yes vote is a disaster!
@SenStabenow You represent me and the people of Michigan and I am opposed to this agreement.
@SenStabenow Your decision was political and party oriented not what the people want.Disappointed and you loss my vote and support.
Shame on you; when that 1st nuclear bomb from Iran goes off - I'll make sure my granchildren know that @SenStabenow contributed to disaster
@SenStabenow 
Thank you Senator Stabenow for standing beside President Obama @POTUS 
And supporting the #IranDeal 
#NoWarWithIran
@SenStabenow so if this great deal doesn't work, you will then put the sanctions back in place.  The sanctions you admit are not working wtf
@SenStabenow Thank you for supporting our best option for a safer world.
@SenStabenow Thank you Senator.
@SenStabenow @Mama4Obama1 Thank you for supporting America's future&security including members of the Armed Forces&our families!
@SenStabenow my god you people in Congress cannot be that blind
@SenStabenow don't vote yes on this Iran deal dint let the president sell out this nation to another country that wants to destroy us
@SenStabenow this is a very bad deal. We have no rights, and you are tying our hands behind our backs. What part of this do you think is ok
@SenStabenow  thanks 4 supporting #Iran #Deal while Hussein Sheikholeslam shouts:#Israel should be annihilated & this is our ultimate slogan
@SenStabenow Imagine how bad the situation 
would have to be some day before the Senator 
considered voting for any military action.
@SenStabenow I think you should READ the "secret" side deals of the Iran deal. That may change your vote!
@SenStabenow You are in good company, Senator. Compare that to 47 traitors who prefer to send Americans to war.
@SenStabenow Thank you for choosing PEACE over WAR
@SenStabenow Thank you for supporting the Iran nuclear agreement.  Signed a grateful constituent.
@SenStabenow If you think that agreeing to this horrible deal us with Iran is going to bring Amir home, you are seriously foolish.

@SenStabenow @joshrogin America is getting very tired of being governed by girly men and LGBT freaks.
@SenStabenow
Your legacy now:
IS caliphate
Iran funded Shia caliphate
US subjugated to UN
Islamist creating Islamic Turkish state

@SenStabenow TY
@SenStabenow As an American and Independent voter it astounds me that you can choose Obama agenda over our kids..enjoy your last term.
@SenStabenow Thank you for voting yes on the deal, Senator. It's in the best interests of the US and the world.
@SenStabenow another Senator that will be unemployed soon. We'll remember in November.
@sailfishmd @SenStabenow what a shame you are.

@SenStabenow thank you for doing be right thing 
@SenStabenow Thank you for supporting the Iran Deal & choosing peace. You are a stand up senator with a great deal of courage.#IranDeal

@SenStabenow @BahmanKalbasi it's obvious who support & why they appease this medieval islamic regime! There r many Iranian traitors abroad.
@SenStabenow. You are a traitor!
@SenStabenow @JPughMI sad to see you think Iran cannot be trusted and are voting for the darkness of the Iran deal. #MIGOV #MIGOP #MIDEM
@RGeorgeDunn @SenStabenow @JPughMI EXACTLY, but don't worry, Iran will inspect themselves....
@SenStabenow Thank you for supporting our POTUS, P5 + 1, UN and world community to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons. #IranDeal
