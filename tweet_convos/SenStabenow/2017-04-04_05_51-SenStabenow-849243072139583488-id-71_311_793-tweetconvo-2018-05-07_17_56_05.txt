You say feminist like is bad. Non feminist is Islamist in favor of sharia law-Real men are proud of female family-want equality for them.
What is 3rd wave?  All red blooded Americans agree for social, political and economical equality for their Daughters, Sisters, Wives & Moms.
Really don't see it still exists?  Maybe not as bad as it was, but stats show facts.  What if is your Wife or Daughter gets 25% less pay?
OK!  You've made your point.
Know how averages work? Exp, edu, career choices all factor in. Wage gap is a myth if you dont get it read up on econ. 2018, count ur days.
Its not a myth. Your obviously republican. Or troll.
It's funny how when you get triggered, "must be a republican"
Right, "oh no someone disagrees with my narrative, must default to name-calling and assumptions". Many sheeple out here not doing research.
It's alright, we have safe spaces for people like this
Stop lying really its insane you guys do this. I will send you a research paper on this filled with facts is you reach out to me

And it says the pay gap is real.
It's between 3-5% not 22% huge difference that could be because of negotiation

"If you control for things like college majors and occupations" narrows the scope significantly. The pay gap is an average across the board.
Not just limited to certain college majors and occupations available only to certain college grads.  Try again.
This kind of nonsense is why Democrats lose so damn much. Women get equal pay. If not corporations would only hire women.
Very deceptive statistic
Thank you senator.
These are Dem talking points garnered to excite their base. Remember, election time next year..."I'll keep standing up for you"
Im disappointed someone who spreads these lies represents my state. It is illegal for businesses to pay their workers based on gender

If women were paid so much less , companies would higher all or more women. This equal pay is bs. I know many women who make more then men
This argument has been debunked. But for a fact Dem Sen Elizabeth Warren in 2016 paid female staff 71% of what male staff made.
Just for your info, in the medieval era, women were men's property in the West. Your avatar of a knight does not speak well for you.
You lost your mind. It's 2017. If that is your best comeback you should stay off of twitter. Go to the facts or shhhhhh.  Seriously.
Ooh . . . a man telling a women to shut up . . . how novel.
Except those women who work for @NancyPelosi
Your gal Warren pays only 71% to women of her male staffers.  Hypocrites you all are.
Do we have ONE example of a woman with similar experience,age, company size and state. Making less?
Your facts are all wrong. More women are in higher paying positions than at any other time in our history.
Yes! Thank you Senator!
Everyday is Equal Pay Day, because women already get payed equally
Highly misleading
In what?  1972?
Maybe they are worth less.  Ask Elizabeth Warren why her female employees earn less.  I bet she has a good answer
Support  Judge Gorsuch
How about addressing the $22+ Trillion debt first. Without doing that this will not matter!
Thank you Sen. Stabenow!
Thanks Senator. Sorry I missed you in Clare. Hope you'll make it to Reed City soon. But love how you stand up for us! Keep fighting!
you tell them Debbie.
Women do make the same if they did the same work. There is no wage gap, there is an earnings gap directly attributed to women working less.
It's already federal law, and if not employers would only hire women to save money. Why do you need lies?
now what about older workers and H1-B abuse?
Thank you for all your work
We already get paid the same. Stop comparing apples to oranges 
in what market or career?
They do!!!!  You know who has fought for equal pay b4 it was popular? @BernieSanders. u know who doesnt pay women = to men? @HillaryClinton
We have laws preventing such things. If you find someone doing this then report them. You should know this...SENATOR

The wage gap is a myth it does not take into account diffrent career options only total earnings vs total earnings not realistic at all
Did you read your letter today? "We will persist in demanding justice."
How do you define work? 
How will you educate our families on personal finances? 
Do you believe more pay will solve America's problems?
Do you believe problems are less when women make less? I know it solves problems when a woman can afford to feed her children
This is a problem you have a position with power to start correcting this. What is your solution?
Hey Senator, how's that national debt coming along? How's that U.S. Student Load debt crisis coming? How's the water in Flynn? #EqualPayDay
Finally, a call for woman who work to be paid equally! Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow must both RESIGN and get the same pay (waste) !!!
@PattyArquette Sad this is still an issue in 2017.
It's not. It's #FakeNews
I do more work than you!! Why do you get paid more and have a Cadillac health care plan and a retirement that is outrageous???
Women are paid equally what country do you live in? In some areas of the country women are paid higher then men.
Thank you for standing up for us!
It is NOT for "doing the same job."
The understanding of the pay gap is a misinterpretation, but your statement is just false. #EqualPayDay
