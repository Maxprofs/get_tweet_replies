especially since not one senator would stand up when their fellow congress asked them to
they were begging them 11 times asking.  Nothing.  If they don't stop this,  time to primary them out
@darlene913 @JCTheResistance @SenStabenow @DSenFloor Can't costs too much. Only the filthy rich can get elected.
You have to have a lot of money but qualifications...none.
THANK YOU for your vote!
@SenSchumer Ok. Now what?
Obamacare was supposed to cut cost 2500 a yr per family. It did the opposite.  Where u lieing then or now or both?
Thank you, Senator!
You are fear mongering.   Michigan voted for Trump respect our vote!
By a margin of 0.3%? Get real. Sen, stay the course!
Are you going to pay my $730 monthly insurance premium with a deductible so high I can never use it?  I am unemployed!
Not the best choice for you if you plan to run for another term.  Pay attention to your constituents. We're watching
Thank you!
@SenSchumer Many thanks!
Is this how the dems are going to help make Wash do something again?
Thank you, Senator.
@SenSchumer Keep fighting to save America's healthcare!  Thank you.
@SenSchumer lies, lies lies
thank you
It is shameful that so many dems are lying to scare people. You know what you posted is dishonest.
drive up costs? Are you kidding? Oh, you don't have ACA. We are paying much more for much less now. Come back to our world.
@SenSchumer Drive up costs? I have friends whose premiums are more than a mortgage. $6500 individual deductibles? Affordable?
Thank you, Senator Stabenow, for voting against repeal. The pressure must be intense. #savehealthcare
thank you Senator! Please keep fighting for us all!
Since you basically have no say in the matter thanks to Harry Reid, who cares?
Thank you
I have no real future or chance at anything now, do I? SSDI, Medicare, Medicaid and Dr's who don't give a whit. thx 4 trying.
Same boat! Our communities will not let us down. Our Senators are trying. Sign petitions, call opposition.TWEET TO
@SenSchumer thank you.
- thank you for your vote.
Costs have never been higher then now. Premiums and huge deductibles!  Basic catastrophic insurance covers nothing else.
thank you for listening to the people!
@WilcoMeThat you're looking particularly sexy today.
thank you
You can tell them we'll be flooding ERs because we can no longer afford the premiums. How much more will that cost? Only choice
@SenSchumer thank you!!!
I will vote against you who does nothing for the middle class. I want you to be on ACA.
But Obamacare SAVED every family $2500, they got to keep their plans & dr.  Premiums and co-pays stayed affordable.  Right
@SenGaryPeters I am proud of my Michigan Senators! They are staying strong and not backing down! God bless! #Michigan #Senate
thank you!!!!
thank you
thank you
Do your colleagues know they will lose their health insurance, too?
thank you
Thank u, @SenStabenow 4 caring about r health and lives @Varidienne
@varidienne Thank you!

Thank you so much for fighting and being a voice for us.
it hasn't stop the cost from going up and all those people losing health care won't happen
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you for your vote!
Thank u for doing the right thing!
Thank you, Senator. On behalf of me and my loved ones with pre-existing conditions who would be put at risk.
Thankyou
REGULATE CORRUPT INSURANCE COMPANIES
drive up cost? Do u live on same planet as rest of us. Prem have quadrupled in 5 yrs. ded up 63% come on at least b honest
Thank you, Senator.
thank you.
Thank you for voting against repeal!
I'm confused by your statement. Premiums have only gone up since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act.
what else can your constituents do to make our voices heard about this?
thank you.
@SenSchumer Too bad, the people DO NOT WANT government in control, you failed miserably. #StoptheBS #CloserNation
@SenSchumer good for you!! Protect the health if all Americans!
@SenSchumer Please, never give up the fight! #DoNotTouchSocSec
@SenSchumer thank you for fighting for us.(ACA)How about the GOP fix it with the type of insurance plan you all have?#GovInspln
thank you for trying to save the $769,124,000 in tax credits given to MI enrollees in 2016.
thank you for protecting the 926,923 MI residents with coverage under the ACA and Medicaid expansion.
@GOP that 30 million is only a small part of the votes you have lost. #voteblue2018 #HistoryIsWatching
Drive up costs. That's rich!!!
Thank you  !
@Headerop1 Thank you

@SenSchumer Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
@TheBaxterBean Thank you Sen Stabenow for your integrity
@TheBaxterBean Thank you for your vote Senator.
Did you read the bill before you voted for it? The costs were low in the past. Deductibles were low. Wake up.
@SenSchumer Healthcare should be a Right. We should all be treated equally. We are being shafted! Fight for the people!
to little, to late Senator. You actively screwed us way back in the primaries. You could have done the right thing & did not.
All your complaints are happening right now with Obamacare- would implode under its own weight in 2017

Thank you for standing up for Michigan and all of America.
Thank you Debbie. Please continue to work with Sen. Peters as a hurdle to Trump's agenda.
thank you.  Now please object to Sessions, Tillerson and Carson.
Thank you!
@SenSchumer The American ppl don't want this piece of crap. That is why Dems are being thrown out.
Thank you!
Thank you, Sen, Stabenow! Please keep letting us know how we can support you in this fight!
Thank you. Signed, One of your Constituents.
LIAR LIAR LIAR. Democrats have no moral compass.
Good thing your vote didn't matter.  Get to the back of the bus.  Michigan voted GOP.
ACA is collapsing under it's own weight and unsustainable.  You know this but offer no solutions.  Hypocrite.
thank you  from one of your constituents who appreciates you standing tall
Thank you!
maybe you should VOTE for it so you can see what's in it ..That is what you did before
when the government wasn't in charge my insurance didn't cost me the equivalent of a mortgage payment every month
Thank you. So many Americans will die if this goes through.
Thank you Senator
@michresist Thank You!!  You all need to get on television tell everyone what they ARE going to lose.
@Patta47cake THANK YOU
@SenSchumer THANK YOU! Help us!
Thank you Senator!
thank you.
Thank you Debbie!
@SenSchumer PARDON ME BUT UR A STUPID IGNORANT PERSON THE ACA HAS DOUBLED THIS YEAR AND U VOTED TO KEEP  ELECTIONS ARE COMING
Thank You for standing up to the GOP rhetoric Sen.Stabenow  
Thank you for doing the right thing, for caring about us & our nation's future.
Thank you Debbie
Thank you, Debbie for your hard work. We need to fight the GOP and all the horrible things they are doing right now! #resist
@SenSchumer guess what dimwits #Obamacare ruined healthcare now unaffordable for most. $6,000 deductible is not affordable.
@SenSchumer insurance companies = corporate welfare. The poor die and they get richer on the taxpayer dollar
big deal!
I cannot understand Republican vindictiveness! They had Zero votes for ACA at outset. 7+ yrs Where is Better & Cheaper fix?
Nothing made health insurance more expensive then obamacare so quit with the bullshit lies!!!!!!!!
ALL Dems must vote against repeal of the ACA. If even one Dem votes for repeal, GOP will claim it was "bipartisan." @metaquest
thank you
@DavidYankovich thank you.
@SenSchumer as a native Michigander and current NY'er, I couldn't be prouder to call you both my Senators. TYSM 4 yr leadership
yeah!  I want 2 see tRumps tax returns!!!
@SenSchumer vote against Tillerson. connection will give Putin, Trump uncontrollable power over America. Oil corruption
thank you for trying
@SenSchumer reviewRachel Maddow last night on MSNBC. Will show the power and profit Trump makes with Tillerson and Putin
@SenSchumer now vote against Tillerson. Trump refuses to show his taxes, sweet on Putin the connection Tillerson, oil, power
Thank you!
We will vote against you - costs have skyrocketed and those of us that are forced to pay those premiums need relief!
@SenSchumer thank you
how do you explain the double-digit premium increases under #ObamaCare each year, for crappier insurance? #RepealAndReplace
@SenSchumer 30 million or 23 million? I have not seen a single GOP say it's gunna be taken away without a replacement
@SenSchumer what did they vote to repeal?  It was a resolution a little disingenuous don't u think?
THANK YOU!
thank you!
@SenSchumer so democrats approve of $2,700/month premiums paid by hard working americans
@SenSchumer insurance companies are in charge.  That's why premiums and deductibles are out of control. Stop lying
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you for standing up for us 
#voterama #TheResistance @DNC
@leapgerbils Thank you, if only others had the backbone to do it!
.@SenStabenow - Thank you for voting to protect millions of Americans. You need to work to persuade those across the aisle. #acaworks
@SenSchumer @MitchMcConell @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump  @MikePenceVP I would submit the cost of HC was going up w/ACA #MAGA
hates #Capitalism. Who bought you?
@SenSchumer 100% increase in premiums/huge deductibles and you're against the repeal? For your constituents #RepealAndReplace
Hard to count the number of lies in this one tweet - might be a new record
@DavidYankovich What can we do now? They just effectively killed friends of mine.
Thank you. I wish more Senators cared enough about people, not party lines, to do the right thing and vote No repeal of the ACA
@SenSchumer Hey Debbie, better hope the Republicans kill Obamacare before your UAW supporters have to pay the Cadillac tax
.@SenStabenow @GersonBorrero Ins companies are in charge with Obamacare. Ask an MD how hard it is to order a simple cat scan.
Thank you Senator Stabenow, you may not be my Senator anymore since I moved to FL but glad to see you're still there
Thank you for trying to help.
@DavidYankovich and use the ACA subsidies as tax cuts for the wealth. "But I don't have Obamacare- I have ACA"
@SenSchumer thank you for your work and efforts. I can't believe I'll be looking for insurance again? Obamacare is good for me
You can tell them we'll be flooding ERs because we can no longer afford the premiums. How much more will that cost? Only choice
@SenSchumer thank you. Again GOP showed colors. Trump said on 60minutes keep pre existing. Ryan no one will be worse off. Hello
Fight on!!!
Thank you Senator. Your GOP cohort are some sick sonsofbitches. Sorry about that, for all of us.
@SenSchumer thank you for speaking up for the voiceless and upholding your duty to the American people.
Thank you, Senator Stabenow!
@DavidYankovich Thank you Please ensure your state voters know GOP cutting ins on kids w cancer
Thank you, Senator!
@DavidYankovich Thank you!
Since only dems voted for Obama care of course your going to vote against repealing it trying to save your hides.
.@SenStabenow @bbkenn92 Thank you. We will remember! (those of us still living).
How about a Blue State Consortium ACA?  A huge market, with generally better health than red states.  Let them wait on @GOP.
@maliksooch @SenStabenow @GOP into it. We shouldn't have to go over the cliff with the fools.
@DavidYankovich thank you! We need you fighting for us.
@SenSchumer
Why did you let them do an end round the filibuster?
@RiseUpAbove thank you, Debbie!
Thank you Senator!
@SenSchumer But u didn't win. Now what do the American people do
@Selu_Peace thank you Senator.
@senschumer they will protect corporate profits b4 protecting the American people!
@SenSchumer Thank you Sen. Stabenow for doing what you were elected to do- represent the citizens of your state
Thank You
@WalkerMishelle Thank you, Senator.
if it is so great, why are you all exempt?
@SenSchumer #KeepAmericaSick
Please do not give up the fight.  T1 diabetes is a preexisting disease with no cure and has the high medical costs of insulin.
That's what the AMA would have you believe thereby hooking you the rest of your life.
Are you confusing Type 1 vs Type 2 diabetes?  Two totally different things.  Please Google.
No...
Got your game now, Juvenile Diabetes Type 1 kills kids.  Where's the AMA in that?
Thank you, @SenStabenow and @SenSchumer.
oh, so continue to screw the working man. Nice! Obamacare is dead! It's over!!
@SenSchumer 30 million Americans that it cost to much to use
I am not for repeal and not for the GOP. But let's get real, the insurance companies are in charge now.
