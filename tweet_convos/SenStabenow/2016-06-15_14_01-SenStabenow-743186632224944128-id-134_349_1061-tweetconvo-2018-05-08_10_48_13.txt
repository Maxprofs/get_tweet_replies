Thank you!
Do you not think it's worth at least trying?
using "utopia" in reference to a killing machine is nothing short of stupidity.
@LeslieMarshall @ChrisMurphyCT sounds like you will be taking away my rights as an honest citizen to defend myself!
No she & other Dems are trying to prevent these attacks and save lives
Why was it not important to make drastic changes before so many children died in Chicago?
It was- Dems trying to make these changes since Colombine
maybe if Dems continued their fight everyday children died in Chicago they would have succeeded!
I don't agree but their picking and choosing makes me sick to my stomach!
