Come out and admit that you were only thinking about a small group at @michiganstateu when you voted YES to PERRY
@SenateDems The people in Mich deserve to know what your doing in DC other than grandstanding.
Give it up. Your are just making voters angry that Presidnet Trump is being denied his cabinet.
And Betsy Devos doesn't??  How could she not be blocked?  You all just left public schools to stand alone!
You are just a sore loser and an obstructionist. We know EXACTLY what you are doing.
LOSERS! WE KNOW WHAT YOU"RE DOING. GIVE PRESIDENT TRUMP HIS CABINET!!!!!!!!
You took an oath the same as I did. Honor it!
You need to get back to work for the American people whom you work for! @POTUS has an agenda for the people #MichiganVotes
liars
As I've written to you today, as a former soldier I didn't get to decide whether or not to serve under a certain @POTUS
will you boycott your pay and benefits while you boycott the vote? If you had an ounce of integrity you would.
