@SenSchumer @SenStabenow RESIGN!
an enema will do you good!  
Some testosterone would do you well.
GO! SENATOR DEBBIE, GO!!!
Thank you for fighting to protect health care for Michigan families. #SaveACA
Michigan went RED in 2016 because @GOP will eliminate the individual & Businesses ACA mandates that are hurting Michigan!
Fight like a hell Deb! We are behind you!
thank you!
Yeah! Watch out for the Code Blue grassroots campaign about this.
YEAH, BE PART OF THE PROBLEM... NOT THE SOLUTION... TYPICAL DEMOCRAT!!!
You didn't read the ACA before passing it.  Why start now?
remove the Obamacare,remove fines, fix the f.d.a. that's why were sick, I lived it. I JUST SAW ANOTHER DRUG BAD - 1 I TOOK !!!
@SenSchumer do your Democratic Duty obstruct the president every chance you get that's what Democrats do best
Obstruct? Have to agree there.
The majority of MI residents voted AGAINST your ideas!
@SenSchumer have you read it yet
Hate?  Protecting healthcare that is about to be stripped from millions is hate?
lol!  This is me RELAXED!  Hope you are having a good day Linda.
Thank you!
Give it your best.  Beholden to Special interests or to the People?  Remind them who they work for.
@SenSchumer great another obstructionist on the Floor. Just go put your head in the sand, that would be better.
We need someone standing for us.  We are afraid they will rob Medicare for which we and our employers paid just like SS.
Thx for your wonderful floor statement highlighting the negative effects Trump Care will have on women's health.
By not using taxpayer money for abortions? Are you that stupid?
Thank you Senator. We  you! Fight for ACA. #NoRepeal!! Health Care is a right not a privilege for the few. #democracyNow
Where in the Constitution, declaration of independence or bill of rights say Healthcare is a right?
How about you shut it and offer up something to fix the imploding ACA.  Stop grand standing and do something.
@SenSchumer you let us down for 8 years. Don't believe a word you say anymore
remind them of hospital closing in rural areas pre ACA. Non-insured still get sick
The ACA gave us higher costs. Who are you to criticize anything?
oh boy won't that be exciting.
Gonna get more than one provider in the UP of Michigan.  You have had how many years to have spearheaded a change and did what?
For the record, have you read it?
As an independent pizzeria owner with almost no profits, I beg you, please continue to fight for our healthcare! Thank you!
@SenSchumer I'd rather watch a septic tank being pumped out.
did u actually read the bill? Or r u just opposing it as u usually do for political reasons?
Thank you, Senator Stabenow!
thank you Senator!
@senschumer WATCH HERE NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH YOU DEMS .WE HAVE FOR 8 YRS POVERTY..JOBLESS LOST OUR HOUSE FORCE TO PROVIDER
thank you, Senator Stabenow.
keep up the good fight! @SenGaryPeters
The ACA is unaffordable and will implode on its own. We were better off with the old insurance.
The ACA is for low income people only who get subsidies. What about the millions who are paying for high deductibles n premium
We will vote you out if you do not repeal ACA!!!
Resign! You do nothing for the middle class who pay taxes!
Thank you!
@SenSchumer keep talking, nobody is listening to your rhetoric. Work on boarder security.
oops, relied on spell check like you rely on the government, my bad.
Thank you!
Thank you!
agreed! It is crap.
Thank you
thank you for doing your part. Without the ACA I would be jobless. I damaged the nerve in my legs the ACA got me treatment
fight it please this new plan will leave many unable to afford insurance
Thank you Debbie! We're with you!
@SenSchumer talk all you want, your savior BHO has destroyed your party. Your voting base is being deported.
why would u want to save an imploding health care system that doesn't work for the people of Michigan let's give us a break
go do not let them cut coverage for 20 million persons
Thank you
@SenSchumer I agree it sucks , the fed is still in control bad place to put my (junk)
plz help them understand increasing HSA contributions does no good for people who can't afford premiums
.@SenStabenow Can you help @SenGaryPeters understand the TRUTH about PPAC and how they DON'T provide mammograms?
Please make them see this new health hill as a disaster.
that's what we like to hear!  Action!  Good luck!
thank you for standing tall!
@SenSchumer #resign
Lets work out the details! But no! The Democrats would be accused of colluding with the Republicans.
it's still basically Obamacare. Now that's it's got the GOP doing it, you stand against it. Lmao. #Hypocrite
@SenSchumer I'm actively campaigning against Debbie stabenow in Michigan. Her time has passed.
anyone find it strange that when the Govt gets its hands on things it becomes a mess and "politics" can "fix" it.
Have you provided any positive ideas for changing the ACA or to busy obstructing
the original Debbie downer
Thank you for representing me so well #Michigan #48823
Go Debbie, go! Stop this ridiculous nonsense.
--  Thank you for speaking up. Keep fighting!
@SenSchumer what are you going to object to, hasn't been debated by republicans?
@SenSchumer #clueless

Thank you for helping us all. God bless you Debbie.

@DSenFloor yes!!  Thank you. I'm done watching the rich make money off the poor
I hope you know what you're talking about?  You did very well with the ACA. Will u say u will replace Congress HC with ACA?
The People are with you!
Thank you. I and my family support you. Our State is great because of your hard work!
God bless you, Senator Stabenow. That bill is a thinly-veiled hate crime - you need to help burn it to the ground.
Everything you libs don't agree on is a hate crime.
Go ahead. I won't watch you. Why do you always have to be so negative? Haven't seen anything coming from you that is better.
well done!
thank you Senator Stabenow
@SenSchumer Both of you please sign up for Obamacare before it collapses.
just regulate doctors salaries and federalize all hospitals. right Deb. all paid for though more taxes.
Thank you Debbie!  My daughter has MS with meds 50k per year!  Thank you!!
Have you muted my Tweets
Thank you. Senator, you and @SenGaryPeters make Michigan proud.
@SenSchumer I like what I heard myself. Sometimes Chuck, you don't always get what you want. 2nd verse same as the 1st.
Go Debbie we got your back.
@SenateDems Thank you for all your hard work to protect our citizens 
Thank you.
RESISTANCE!! Please save our healthcare!!
debbie please stop them. I wont be able to pay for house and health care through this.
good!  Thank you
Please talk for a very, very long time.
@SenSchumer do you personally have Obamacare?
Thank you for fighting for us!! 
@SenateDems @GOP  if you really care for the AMERICAN PP you will stand to protect ACA !Shame on you !! The pp will remember !!
@SenateDems. You hit the nail on the head. Thank you from a RN who sees everyday what happens when people are not insured.
@SenSchumer go ahead and show everybody your closed mind. Surprised you are happy with the ACA.
excellent!
Im from Michigan and I'm here to tell you I'm screwed if I have to choose between healthcare and my home!
@SenSchumer No thanks, I just ate
@SenateDems thank you Senator Stabenow for fighting to protect the healthcare of millions at risk under this horrible plan
@SenSchumer Rs quick to say ppl will have access. Docs do not have to take patients they don't want-Medicare, Medicaid
Thank you!
@SenSchumer you need to do was best for the people not your party for the people the American people
@SenateDems good luck! 
Thank you, Senator.
@SenSchumer maybe you should go and add some constructive ideas isn't that your job.
@SenateDems Thats why your partys loosing races trying to oppose instead of compromise and create bipartisan bills.
@SenSchumer someone should  say how hard it is to find a doc who will take Medicare patients, not to mention medicaid.No access
@SenateDems Thank you!!!!!
u food, & medication are not properly vetted. Atheist created a racketeering system to educate students in atheismÂ©
Why not support it, pass it, and teach Americans a lesson about irresponsible voting while torpedoing Reps. in 18?
That requires people who understand relationship between cause and effect. Clearly not the case.
simp
@SenSchumer  im guessing you already read the bill then. Atleast you didnt have to sign it so you can see whats in it
$375/month, $4k deductible, 50% coverage. Wanna trade?
The only 2 words that stand out in the repeal, access and competition. We had access and competition in healthcare in 2009.
Therefore nothing changes as far as the cost of healthcare. Other than the cost goes up faster.
THANKS-ques in ACHA can ins. co. raise my premiums/costsharing for pre-exis cond? & can they put yrly cap on my benefits?
@SenSchumer oppose everything. Very lame and unproductive strategy. Bring ideas to the table!
@SenSchumer you ain't doing us any favors your angle is still single payer
Thank you for fighting for us.  THe ACA should be revised a little but what they are offering will not help us..
Yes, lets vote to keep the plan where hard working blue collar America works their ass off to pay for everyone!!
@SenSchumer. Say the right things, be truthful, don't lie. #trumpisgreat #schumershouldresign #firepelosi
This plan will #soakthesick, premiums will go up when Americans are sick or injured, at their most vulnerable.
@SenSchumer don't take no shit, are democrats powerless against GOP. #taxes #russia #impeach
Thank you!
@SenateDems kick some butt!
YOU MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO GO CRY.
Thank you for standing up for people like me who depend on the #ACA.
@SenateDems nothing to oppose.  GO GOP...
yep because being unable to afford insurance means dying or bankruptcy. So you can save some money
@SenSchumer more lies are sure to come
You have not even read it and just because your a democrat your opposed to it. Your not doing your job Senator read the bill.
thank you I hope you cover all citizen fairly especially those who need the care the most insurance and drug co. only see money
Fight as hard as you can! We need you to be our voice in the Senate right now.
thank you thank you thank you!
Ms. S. I'm opposed to lousy changes to ACA. Please find a way to work with GOP to get the best for all Americans. TY.
yes Americans don't need to spend less on Healthcare, where is the cost savings in Obamacare? Your plan didnt/doesn't work
Premiums rose 20% since ACA passed. Premiums rose 31% in five years prior. More coverage = lower costs.
numbers being quoted are from what source?
Kaiser Family Foundation.
only numbers that count are GAO
I'm unaware of any GAO studies that cover insurance premium increases prior to 2010. Do you have a link?
Thank you for standing up for our healthcare
work with them instead of fighting? ACA is not affordable who pay their own way. Take from others to give to others?
Yes! Thank You! Sen.Stabenow
thank you Debbie! I will remember this at election time
so will I...ur vote cancelled!
Thank you Senator!
