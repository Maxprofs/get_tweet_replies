I can't find the info about premiums in that report. If it is saying annual increases of 20% for 9 years, that's a compounded 416%.
Which would mean that a premium of $500 a month today would increase to $2580 a month in 2026.
But I'm sure all those billionaires won't want us to be bankrupt or dead, so they would give generously to the middle income medical fund. 
Maybe everyone other than elderly and veterans should pay for their own insurance. I do. And my premiums are considerably more than in 2010
Mine is more as well but w/ACA more of my fellow Americans have coverage I am Ok with extra $ as a am a Christian.
Religion has nothing to do with expecting all citizens to work and pay their own way.
Small children born with terrible diseases cannot pay there own way at 3 or 5 years old .  Veterans with PTSD may (1)
Not be able to pay.  People who hit a hard patch after divorce or multiple deaths in their family might not be able (2)
So basically nothing has changed. Aca is a shit show of increasing premiums
Only because it's being white-anted by GOP. Make it better and it WILL work.
Neither party is discussing lowering the cost of care. Instead its only premiums and deductibles. Need to focus on bringing cost care down
You mean GOP isn't.
What does it say about how much penalties will be for folks who choose or can't afford to carry insurance?
If the mandate is removed, there can be no tax penalty like it currently sits.
And the mandate is being removed?
If it becomes law, yes
Interesting.
And, if you choose not to buy insurance and get sick you can't buy insurance.
I can still pay to go to the doctor though, right?
Yep. It will just be more costly.  I guess if enough ppl die docs will lower their prices.
@salemstate
HEROS are FOREVER! Presidents come and go & most of them are forgotten! CONGRATULATION Senator John McCain! https://twitter.com/sarrata/status/888045693318942720 …
CBO is rarely correct. Premiums and especially deductibles under Ocare already skyrocketed. It's still law of the land if you didn't hear.

Gotta love the Common Core math the left loves to use.
Downloaded. We are paying attn. Time to correct it. ;)
@realDonaldTrump you call this a better bill?  Can you add and subtract? #TheResistance @jodomeow
I believe the number of folks that won't have health  ins is going to higher than predicted  - seniors - children - unemployed/employed
Yeah, but do like the ultra rich still get their tax break?  Asking for Steve Wynn
Actually, no, not here.
Naw... they will cut taxes without paying  for them... as always.
L
It's the freedom to pay more for less. Republican style freedom.
God almighty.  The gits have no soul.
Unfortunately when used by Republican hacks "freedom" is code & a warning that they're trying to screw you.
And yet the minimum wage increase is ignored because cause & effect...meh
But at least it won't have Obama in the name amirite
In case anyone thought it was a good idea to pass that bill last night
See what Trump followers want for their fellow Americans, these people have no God and no shame, especially that troll Pence
Fuuuuuuuuu
#Shame @PatTiberi @senrobportman you should both be very ashamed.  Fix the ACA 700k people in Ohio now have coverage.
The Freedom to pay more and get less... that's Trump #MAGA
At $7.30 an hour for work it would take everybody in the family to work just so I can afford Health Insurance !! .
Freedom Bill? Freedom from having access to health care?
@joeljanse this is worse
At least I wouldn't be forced to buy the garbage. Plus the CBO said the ACA would lower premiums and they have gone up well over 20%
Thank you Andy and @USCBO for working so hard to let us know what's going on.
Wow
Like I said FcK @MitchMcConell
Shouldn't that have been known as the "Freedom from Healthcare" bill?
So now time to join rest of world & opt for single payer healthcare?
#failOmatic45 for the un-win
freedom from tax for billionaires!
For those few who will be able to afford it. 36 million more will be without insurance
This is horrible. Why don't they like the people who PAYS them their salaries & buys them their health care???! We deserve good health care!
Maybe Trump supporters SHOULD lose their coverage. Might make them think twice before casting a vote for a moron. Would serve them right!
This just in, Trump now thinks CBO is fake news
Thank god I am a disabled veteran and I got VA benefits....Gonna be laughing at all those trump supporters
That is absolutely criminal!!
@GOP @SenatorBurr @ThomTillis vote no. I know you don't give a damn about actual humans, but we are who you are supposed to represent.
Lost ins. and cut to partime after ocare. Cry me a river
But do R's care?
That's a damned good cost reduction. Yes, I'm using liberal math. How's that compare to prior years?
GOP NEEDS TO BE BEAT DOWN IN 2018...this shit is ridiculous. Party over Country...even if people die.
What does the CBO think of global warming?
Thanks CBO for the red flag. Kill this bill.
that's a 515% increase on Americans' premiums by 2026, vastly more than what's "saved"
Because the CBO is always accurate??
2018: 120%
2019: 144%
2020: 173%
2021: 207%
2022: 249%
2023: 299% 
2024: 359%, 
2025: 430%
2026: 516%
2027: 619%
Murder is easy when  you don't know faces and names
To all who voted for a GOP Senator...this is your Senate...
Due to compounding, that translates to premium more than 6 folds higher in 10 years.
The CBO has no fans among those who are familiar w them. Their forecasts are right only 10% of the time.  #MAGA
So roughly $21.60 according to crooked donny drump
Its like old fashioned health care, where families can go bankrupt because of a car accident.
Now where's the freedom in that?
Freedom to take your money. @SenateGOP
It's hard to believe we are still living in #America anymore.
it truly is. I can't believe no one is brave enough to take a stance against this!
No it's the #mmmmma. Mitch McConnell Memorial Medical Murder Act
Where in the cbo pdf does it say "Premiums will be 20% higher in EVERY year 2018-2026"
Time for every American that cares for thei neighbor to vote GOP out! Need Universal Healthcare right= 30 countries save $ and lives!
Do you know if this is above the historical increase? I'm trying to figure this out, but hope someone else knows quicker...
What the fuck kind of "freedom" is this for people who are disabled and cannot afford the medications they need to survive?
Insurers just lost their government handout & their customers. Hell, if I can't get adequate coverage, I won't pay for inadequate coverage.
Good job @GOP
Why not just send us pre-addressed envelopes so we can send our $$ directly to the 1%?
Yes it's truly liberating to be enslaved financially to an oligarchy because that is a symbol of democracy, right?
They don't care.
The freedom to raise rates every year that's freedom. Knowing your stock will go up every yr w/o the CEO doing any thing, freedom.


@SenatorEnzi 20% increase every year! Less coverage, more expensive. Where's your compassion? @PattyMurray
Note to Bernie or Busters: this is what Bust looks like. 16M lose insurance next year

Stop calling if "Freedom Bill"!!!!!
"nailed it"
What exactly are you fixing in Obamacare?  2018!  @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
And the 2nd Obamacare CBO score showed how it would raise the debt! You want O care, start cutting programs and agencies that overlap
Wait I thought premiums were the problem...
Freedom never felt so cruel.  #shameful
It's going up faster than that now, dicknose
BREAKING:  CBO scores are typically way off and hence forth considered garbage.
.@ASlavitt "Freedom" from taxes if one is wealthy.
End Medicaid and Medicare NOW.
That's impossible.
Why? It would align back with the Constitution.
Andy call it #TrumpCare,please
I will NEVER call it the Freedom Act
But everyone is going to be winning with JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! So details like this don't matter, right?
That's cool mine will go down. Because they went up 120% under #ACA
Freedom from healthcare
Please vote no @SenJohnMcCain!
#RegularOrder
Please vote no @SenBobCorker and @SenAlexander! 
20% increase in premiums?!
whatever
How did they get a CBO that fast?!?
20% increases to premiums compounded for the next 9 years will be devastating to the American people. Please do not vote for this bill.
What's with the "Freedom" moniker? Free to DIE because we can't afford it anymore? I guess so.
@SenatorEnzi @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain @SenMikeLee @SenCapito Do the Math!

Freedom for whom??????
um cab we get a comparison to how high they will go up under another yr of Obama care plz  ^_^ which is more, is the important question.
This is a comparison between the current law and the proposed one...so 20 higher than Obamacare...
so it adds 20% ontop of the premium increase we will already get from Obama care?
Yes...
don't... me Walter :P I'm on mobile so I can't read the file
Oh, goodie!!!
@sendavidperdue and @SenatorIsakson -- how can you justify this to GA? Those political ads will be BRUTAL.
Get it to the floor!
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC you are taking away millions and leaving rest of us without food money!
It's trumppolitalcare not freedom! Only freedom is uninsured people to die!
#FakeNews
Now go back to original Obamacare score.  Right or wildly, horiffically wrong?
This new bill sounds great. Is this the hill you want to die on?
No.  Prefer total repeal. Just pointing out your outrage over CBO numbers is foolish.
Not outraged over CBO. Not outraged at all, actually. But everyone-GOP Sens. too-knew that bill was garbage and they pretended it wasn't.
Dishonest is the best word I can conjure.
Kindest too.  Hopefully the seven  all get tossed out at nearest opportunity.

"tax cuts...tax cuts...tax cuts..." 
and they don't care. Heartbreaking!
Somebody please tackle Enzi!! It's time to ask some questions!
@tobiasbuckell They're, like, so?
@JeffFlake & @SenJohnMcCain  indifference? Callousness? #MAGA?Why are you supporting this?
Affordable Healthcare is non-partisan. .@GOP, STOP sabotaging ACA! Work to fix it, make it better for Americans. #TrumpCare is #TaxCuts4Rich
@AG_Conservative see? Do you see?
See what? Of course premiums will be higher. All this bill does is repeal the mandates, without the actual cost reforms (which BCRA had).
So if premiums are higher and people can no longer afford insurance - you are taking it away.
Each one of these asshats up for election in '18 must lose their seat.
@SenCapito PLEASE!!
Jesus fuck, how'd they even manage that?
@SenatorLankford Please vote against this. It will harm our state and your constituents!
This is going to kill people and crash the economy.
Some people might have thought this was a wee bit over the top a few days ago.
#TheManWhoBrokeAmerica literally
No One Man can break this nation apart unless enablers allow it & citizens look away in apathy.
20% increase in premiums annually! Vote NO!! https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/s.a.667.pdf …
@senatorcollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenJohnMcCain @SenWarren
How is the CBO so damn fast?
Freedom from what???? Fuck's sake
As long as billionaires get to keep more money, I can die happy.
Young and happy.
Andy I don't know how to read that document - which line item shows the 20% increase? I'm absolutely sick and paralyzed with fear.
And their predictions should be trusted why again? They are almost as accurate as MSM, bogus polls & predictions!!
Guess I won't be able to afford healthcare by 2019.
The GOP are a new level of trash.
@marcorubio Throw us under the bus...again?
Economic Anxiety!
Help!
seriously, how is this happening? How can trumpers still defend this guy and this party??
#RIPGOP
Thrilled about having the Freedom™ to die broke if I get sick
@SenCapito @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins facts. VOTE NO!
great news. everyone in red states will die faster and they voted for it. poetry in motion!
Red states are highly gerrymandered, so many of us didn't vote for it but could die anyway.
That's fine. My premium has tripled since Obamacare started so what's the difference?
That's fixable if GOP would do it. This isnt
They broke it, they bought it. It should be completely untenable by 2018. This isn't Obamacare anymore.  The GOP owns it.
I doubt rationality, facts, or data will stop them from gleefully throwing us all under the bus to satisfy their weird ideological fetishes.
Well isn't that swell? So, that means premiums will rise about 200
Percent, give or take, in that timeframe?
.@SenateGOP But you already knew this. You know this makes things worse, not better. .@SenCapito @robportman @sendeanheller @lindseygrahamSC
Yes they are this stupid.
Too bad Wyoming Senator not given a heads up about this  #Freedomfraud bill
20% higher than the already rising premiums.
The GOP criminals don't care about Anything except cutting taxes for the Rich - shame!!! Fight for your rights or they will take them all
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @SenCapito @SenDeanHeller @SenRonJohnson Please pay attention to these numbers and do the right thing.
I negotiate health care packages. With the ACA we're seeing 7% increases with Anthem and 12% with Kaiser this year. #KiLLTHEBILL
Me too, do you remember the increases prior to aca? Ours were between 18-23% in Pittsburgh. Trying to budget extra 100k annual was painful
@SenSasse @SenatorFischer will you do this to the most vulnerable Nebraskans?
and that's what they call "Freedom."  Interesting.
"Freedom," what a joke.  #skinnybill   I'm not laughing, tho.
@SenJohnMcCain please vote no
@JeffFlake Please consider this before you put party before country again
Hold on, do they assume a 20% increase in year 1 that then stays constant or 20% more each year over the previous one?
The latter
That would mean by 2023 my premiums would exceed my gross income. I hope medicaid still exists by then.
That means my premiums go up $120/month. How do I absorb that? I am not @IvankaTrump who pulled in $12M last quarter. More than my mortgage.
@SenJohnMcCain you spoke the other day about your proudest moments. This will not be one of them.  Vote No or your words will be empty!
@SenSasse @DebFischerNE think this is a good bill to vote for?  Please vote NO!!!!
super important to focus on the 6 million the CBO says will lose EMPLOYER PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE #skinnybill
Oh good, real solutions that work for everyone!
Senate Freedom to die without any help bill. These bastards want our taxes for their uber wealthy donors. Fuck them all.
The one and true Freedom Bill...
This is so perfect because everyone I know gets a 20% raise every year and never gets sick or old!
Lol, you know the worse the cbo score, the better for Rs, right?
If only US senators had access to such information!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott ...just CCing you on this
Alright! Only 20% annual increases sounds pretty good for a family of 4 right now. #repeal #replace #whatever
Was the CBO at lunch? Or did they just receive it when it was made public?
Dispicable.
Ah, but F-R-E-E-D-O-M
And no one to blame but @SenDeanHeller and @SenCapito and @SenJohnMcCain and @JeffFlake and @robportman and @LindseyGrahamSC. Oppo ads!! Sad
COWARDS
@justdreamin91 Holy crap. In 5 years we'll be paying 100% more than we're paying now. JFC
Four years. Triple in six years. Etc.
This is so fucked up..
No, it's not.

What can citizens do NOW?
Get in a time machine, go back, not elect these evil bastards...
My vote didn’t contribute to this mess. Still boggles my mind that  anyone in America pulled the lever for this (dangerous) clown show.
I didn't mean you literally. Or other reasonable people. We can only hope for better voter turnout to combat this insanity.
I know you didn’t mean me, personally. I’m simply frustrated that citizens have hands tied tonight. #killbill
All this winning! Trumpcare wins the highest premiums race, too!
#TheBest #SoLuxurious
It seems only the uber wealthy are winning. If only there were warning signs the orange menace was a conman who would say anything 2 b liked
Shit! I know! I just heard something like there are over 500 American Billionaires today, and not one of them is Batman. WTF???
.@SenJohnMcCain Show some dignity, vote against the repeal bill that will hurt your constituents.
He obviously doesn't care
@SenCapito This is insane. Vote no!
No freedom in that
Thanks @RepWesterman
Don't call it that it is skinny bill.
@SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @SenCapito @robportman @SenDeanHeller If you vote for this bill, premiums will be higher EVERY year!
That is about a 200 percent increase in that time, give or take.
Done on the Medicare Anniversary
7/27/65

52 years ago TODAY, I presided over House passage of Medicare--a promise we made to care for those in…
@JohnDingell They're going to take care of that too. It's evisceration starts with the House 2018 budget.
Ruan already has a cut in his tax legislation.  Also this bill causes Medicare fees to increase ~2.3%.
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE SAVES. SENATE PLAN: #DIGMOREGRAVES
How can ANYONE think this is Okay? It's so incredibly destructive.
Compounded?
Meaning the increases stack year over year? OMFG.
The worse the CBO score is, the better it is for Republicans.
This will kill Americans
Heckuva job there, @LindseyGrahamSC @SenRonJohnson! Way to destroy your own states!  Idiots!!
They don't care
One silver-lining from tonight. @realDonaldTrump is going to call this a repeal even though it leaves OC infrastructure in place.
If he bitches about OC now his base will be confused, thinking that they already repealed. @GOP owns healthcare now even tho they broke it.
#NoHCFA Higher Costs For All.
@SenJohnMcCain Put an end to this madness!
