@DelphiRetirees And you are working diligently to restore the pensions of the Delphi salaried retirees, aren't you, Senator?
please explain to the nation and your constituents what you have done to help the #Delphi Retirees http://www.delphisalariedretirees.org/delphi/index.php/what-we-are-fighting-for â€¦
democrat gone republican -- An im doing it Again in 2018--- Hypocrite is what you ARE
You type that knowing that you have done nothing for Delphi salary employees who had their pensions stolen?  Hypocrite.
Thank you!
"a pension is a promise". You and the Obama Admin. illegally broke that promise. HYPOCRITE! https://www.delphisalariedretirees.org/delphi/ 
@SenateDems @YouTube Steve Mnuchin only understand what's goes into his bank account. He has no interest in rights of consumers
Thank you!!!
really?  Guess you forgot about the Delphi Salaried Retirees.
it is not up to taxpayers or companies to pay for government or private sector pensions that's why we have 401k(s)
@SenateDems @YouTube When will Ur crying, whining, protests, bitterness, childish behavior ever end?
thank you, but why don't the Rebus get it? We're screwed.
sorry Republicans
@SenateDems @YouTube a government employee pension is THEFT from the tax payers. Government pensions should be illegal!
except that is is literally protected in our Constitution.
would like to see that same comment apply to my friends at Delphi.
When will you start to work with this new administration? Do your duty.
please demand Trump release his taxes and demand a thorough investigation into Russian ties. Our democracy is at stake
I'm not a public worker and my company has a pension.
It is a publicly trade company and we are nonunion.
That's because he's a freaking millionaire - what does he need a pension for? @SenStabenow @SenateDems @YouTube
Thank you Debbie for listening to your constituents.
#SCROTUS
please endorse impeaching Trump
Kudos to you&staff on the excellent research done on this candidate! Steve Mnuchin is not on the side of the little guy.
lesson to children and young adults, work for yourself, start your own business, steer clear of corporate jobs
please keep fighting this unqualified and offensive cabinet! #RepublicansAmericaIsWatching
What do you understand? Show up with the herd and drink from the well of participation. Break from the 'party herd'!
Please recall what the Detroit pension program did to help bankrupt the city of Detroit in your state
guess your speech didn't mean sh*t.. Steve Mnuchin makes it thru...hahahahaha
A REAL KNOTHEAD
.Dems are out of touch with people..Pelosi thinks Bush is POTUS.Walters thinks Russia is invading Russia.
you obstruct everything..its disappointing that the Dems have gone this road..you need to work together or retire
Keep up the fight against the pathological lying tangerine pussy grabber and his evil ilk brain-dead followers. #ShePersisted
NO!
@SenateDems @YouTube Thank you, Senator, for this thoughtful piece. You are our Hero!
I'm one of your constituents. Thank you!
@SenateDems @YouTube go dry up in a home pls
@SenateDems @YouTube Tax payers R being robbed blind by this administration can't wait 2 C how bad it is when all is confirmed
Debbie you're so #predictable.  Surprise us someday by telling us you support a #Republican nominee.  @SenStabenow @YouTube #holdmybreath
@SenateDems fine but if that company doesn't have a future workforce don't look for the rest of the nations taxpayers to cover
@SenateDems get rid of unions then what? Problem solved? Cheaper labor, dangerous work conditions so management can save a buc?
@SenateDems @YouTube - Corporate pensions disappeared over the years. Only government pensions go on to soak the taxpayers.
@SenateDems half the country is right to work,crippling unions ability to exist in those states. Are they in such better shape?
@SenateDems Educate yourselves on history of unions and how they started and why they started. I load a garbage truck every day
@SenateDems The war on unions continue. We're not the enemey. We exist so management doesn't take advantage of workers.
@SenateDems @YouTube Which means Steve Mnuchin doesn't understand that an employee is a person.
I have no pension. I have to work until I'm 72, if I make it that long. You suck.
@SenateDems @YouTube Stop delaying and obstructing. What are you doing? Confirm nominees. Fix Healthcare, jobs, taxes.
She should also "drain the swamp". Go @SenStabenow !
.@SenStabenow Doesn't seem to understand that the Social Security System is not a pension system. Pretty basic stuff.
@SenateDems @YouTube thank you !!
@SenateDems @YouTube R u afraid the pension u don't deserve will go by by?
Nah, I've heard enough character assaults, they're meaningless now. Get some real work done.
Not watching your speech!! Trump could pick a Democrat and you would be against it!! You have more lame excuses!!
Democrats know all about false promises..."you can keep your doctor".."affordable healthcare"... Democrat lies.
Not to mention a payment earned for services rendered.  Thank you, Senator!
it's stealing from the taxpayer. Retired, no more work, no more pay. That simple.
@senatedems EVERY Blue vote and enough Reds sh/ vote NO against Mnuchin!
Please don't just come out in opposition. Fight. Geithner was a disaster for ordinary people. Don't approve a clone.
thank you @SenStabenow Keep up the great work!
It's compensation, offered for work to spare the employer the larger expense in the present. It's owed, not a favor.
you won't be re elected
Let me guess, you're not going to support him?
mislead
Thank you? Senator Stabenow. RESIST
Meant Thank you"!" Not Thank you"?"
Like when Obama dumped the pensions of thousands of Delphi salaried retirees?
