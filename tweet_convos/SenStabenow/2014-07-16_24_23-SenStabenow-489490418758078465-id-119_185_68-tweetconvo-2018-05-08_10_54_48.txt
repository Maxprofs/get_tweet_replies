@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse  Excellent! Hopefully Dems will stop the misrepresentation of the SCOTUS decision.
@SenStabenow as it should be you and the liberals misrepresent the ruling of the SCOTUS to suit you ideology. Pay for your own abortion meds

@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse HOW ABOUT A COUNTRY THAT TAKES PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELVES AND STOP KILLING 50 MILLION MINORITY BABIES
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse They must really dislike ladies. Or really love corporate personhood. Maybe both?
@jonathanfranks @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Maybe just believe in being responsible for yourself.
@MarkCanipe @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Like being able to make health decisions for yourself regardless of gender.
@jonathanfranks @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse And you cant?
@MarkCanipe @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse I don't know what that means. Why do you think businesses should have more rights than people?
@jonathanfranks @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Because they own it! I have rights at my house you dont! Because I own it. You dont have to visit!
@MarkCanipe @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse That doesn't make any sense. A person isn't property, and they never lose all of their rights.
@jonathanfranks @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse You have no right to demand that I pay your bills, provide you a home, pay your grocery bill, etc.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse No, the bill would force companies like Hobby Lobby to pay for abortion-causing drugs.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse No, they stopped your attempt to go round the supreme court. Ideological hacks.
@SenStabenow No, they filibustered the bill to protect 1st Amend Free Exercise of Religion #HobbyLobby
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse tell your constituents Hobby Lobby has no business in their bedrooms.  Neither does gov't but you know #Obamacare
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse losing my home. Zero jobs thanks to this state
@SenStabenow What are @TheDemocrats doing about economy & #DetroitWater people remember at election time #BorderCrisis #MarineHeldInMexico
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse They are so out of touch with reality.  There is a REAL world out here that they need to connect with.
Yay! #youhaveotheroptions  #pickoneoftheother16 @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse if Hobby Lobby is qconcerned about #abortion why use a Chinese company that forces women to abort "illegal" babies
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse #PrayToEndAbortion
@SenStabenow stop spreading lies about the Hobby Lobby ruling. #demsWarAgainstWomen MUST STOP #ObamacareFail

@SenStabenow @NahBabyNah Stop lying about the Hobby Lobby decision, they still pay for 16 kinds of birth control Your #FakeWarONWomen sucks
@SenStabenow @NahBabyNah Good job!!!
@SenStabenow @NahBabyNah STFU Debs. Nothing is non-accessible you liar.
@SenStabenow ...Rs don't realize it yet, but long term, this will work against Personal Religious/Beliefs Freedom and Rights.
@SenStabenow Keep fighting. Not only is this about Women's rights, it's about equal rights, including equality between religions....
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Now why am I not surprised by that? What a bunch of useless obstructionists. Keep trying. Don't give up!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Who really didn't expect that. SCOTUS did their part to help and now the REDCOATS are doing theirs! Who's shocked?
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Says it all you liberal fools!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse #HobbyLobby pays for 16 different types of birth control!!!!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse The insurance company still has to, and they can charge it back to the insured person.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse *can't
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse All the supreme court did was rule that a closely held corporation (hobby lobby) didn't have to pay for it.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse ...damn guess you'll have to pay for your non medical decisions now NOT the taxpayers. ..
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse grrrr!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Thank You House Republicans
.@SenStabenow hey Debbie, you senate dems are sitting on a ton of jobs bills maybe get on that and BC can be bought by those needing

@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse stop wasting the taxpayers $. What a shame where our country is being led on fringe items.
So #SCOTUS upholding Obamcare is settled law yet when it comes to religious liberty, not so much? You're a disgrace @SenStabenow #HobbyLobby
@SenStabenow @timmcrae77 Too bad you don't have the wisdom or truth of 
Senator @TomCoburn
@SenStabenow so Republicans blocked a bill that removes the forced provision of products for employees, and restores liberty for both sides?
Evil bastards! RT @csuwildcat @SenStabenow
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse The underlying principle of this Bill is to eliminate discrimination and to insure men & women are treated equally.
@SenStabenow @PattyMurray u speak mostly on bhehalf of sex workers -lets b honest- they r desperate to get free birthcontrol #hobbylobby
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse - pretty sure that SCOTUS has already ruled on this.  Now trying to legislate?  How about moving on...
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse We have affordable access to contraception. Another liar and chief zombie. It must be pay day for you all.
“@SenStabenow: Republicans just filibustered a bill to guarantee affordable access to contraception. #HobbyLobby http://1.usa.gov/1nJZdzX ”

@SenStabenow @PattyMurray Viagra is for the men's pleasure but women are paying for it in taxes I do not want to pay for it !!!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Shocking!  I mean, you could bowl me over with a feather. Who woulda thunk it?
.@SenStabenow As one of your constituents, I say: good. You're such a hack. Do you ever do anything that Harry Reid doesn't tell you to do?
@SenStabenow @PattyMurray Remember there is no war on women GOP is waging war on women This is just more proof
@SenStabenow @PattyMurray It SHOULD B debated. Righteous defeat. Rewrite, Let the Fed Pay, Take $ from NSA to fund #NotTheFedsBusiness
#shame rt @SenStabenow: Republicans just filibustered bill to guarantee affordable access to contraception.  http://1.usa.gov/1nJZdzX ”
@WhiteHouse @SenStabenow yay, that's good news
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse because women are clearly incapable of walking into any Walgreens and pay for their own contraception...so...
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse will you stop with this birth control is cheap enough we have bigger problems to deal with so get to work
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse I can't wait to throw you all out...worthless bunch of morons.
@SenStabenow Of course.  The party of Jesus has never been known for compassion.
@SenStabenow @PattyMurray contraception? This was about abortion #NotTheFedsBusiness
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Secure our borders before someone walks a nuke in!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse somebody need to stop doing the DO then.
@SenStabenow Of course they did.... #Sigh
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse by affordable you mean pay for anything....
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Liar! This isn't about access-it's about not paying for something that goes against rel. beliefs
@SenStabenow is also clueless: RT @SooperMexican: Six Common Myths About the Hobby Lobby Ruling Absolutely Debunked: http://wp.me/p1s2oW-1Eu 
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse . Madness!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Not familiar with things like "facts" and "truth", are you?
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Why are old dudes deciding my contraceptive rights? Not cool.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse if you can't afford it yourself maybe you shouldn't be having sex.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Lies, lies, lies... You can still kill babies with your own money. Shameful!
@SenStabenow and the #US idiotic gun laws makes it a country lots of people don't take serious....
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Gee, my health insurance doesn't pay for my condoms. BCP's $9 / month at wal mart.
.@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse I don't think "filibustered" means what you think it means....
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse In other words, Republicans stopped you and your fellow goons from circumventing the law.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse U mean Republicans filibustered a bill that would have force people to pay for other people contraception.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse #HobbyLobby it was 4 out of 20 forms of BC Stop playing games + fix tax code, cleanup immig, IRS. Do some real work
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse stabenow is garbage! Represents Michigan in the worst ways.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Not exactly true republicans didn't "block" anything.  Clearly an election year!

@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse stabenow and Obama are dumbasses.
@SenStabenow #assholes
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse This is a surprise? Dems will profit from this in Nov.
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse the fact that HL still offers BC just not the type that cause abortion side affects still isn't good enough?
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Thank God in Heaven for those Republicans. Y'all shd be run out of DC on a rail 4 this assault on #USConstitution
@lafcity @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Women have access to affordable contraception because it is available AND affordable.  U mean FREE!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse  GOOD FOR THEM! You do know if you take money or credit card you can walk into any drugstore and buy contraception?
@SenStabenow The @GOP hates womenfolk, deems them too difficult to understand...
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse Generic TriSprintic birth control pill is $9/mo at Walmart. Ummmm, yeah...filibuster away. #HobbyLobby
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse You also fail to mention the filibuster to keep abortion pre-24 weeks a state issue. You give women a bad name.
@SenStabenow @HealthCareTara Liars. No one is denying access.
Does hobby lobby not offer prescription contraception or something? @SenStabenow @WhiteHouse
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse thank god!
@SenStabenow @WhiteHouse So I guess you can't get any now?
@senstabenow @whitehouse I have a question. A filibuster used to mean that they would talk & talk to delay a vote.  What does it mean today?
“@SenStabenow: Republicans just filibustered a bill to guarantee affordable access to contraception. #HobbyLobby http://1.usa.gov/1nJZdzX ”Good
@SenStabenow  SCOTUS ruled that HHS has responsibility to provide those drugs, Tell Administration to quit stalling.
@SenStabenow I'll bet none of them are women, either.
