JUST IN: Andrew Puzder is expected to withdraw as Pres. Trump's nominee for secretary of Labor, sources tell @NBCNightlyNews. 
@SenSchumer time to retire Debbie. You're views no longer represent our beautiful state. You've thrown in w/ the bomb throwers
@Monte_Alto good he either has something to hide or just don't want to put up with the crap.
Most likely sees the writing on the wall. Anyone taking a position with Trump is committing professional suicide.
@SenSchumer can u blame him? He would never get anything done with you dems tryin to destroy our country and block everything!
We want an investigation into Trumps Russian Ties; His accounting. His Tax Returns.  Make it happen.
Too bad Oprah didn't have video on DeVos.
@SenSchumer and I can tell my young daughters that they don't have to eat cheeseburgers while wearing flag bikinis. Ugly dude!
Not too disappointed he resigned.  Too much baggage.  It had NOTHING to do with you though.  Sit down and shut it.
@SenSchumer you are rooting for America to fail.  Idiots
Thank you, Debbie. As your constituent, you have my support. You are very responsive to my calls and email.
a great loss for our country, he would have helped everyone union and non-union... Sad sad sad
so you bullied someone again. There are no wins when you are involved.
@SenSchumer both of you are hateful losers.  We won. You lost!!!!!
#NotStabenow2018
@SenSchumer All Dems know to do is obstruct. Stabenow has been doing it for about 80 years I think. No solutions #whyyoulost
You are a poor leader. Disappointed in your actions. A Democratic puppet.
@NBCNightlyNews thanks Senator Stabenow keep up the good fight.  Truly need you now more then ever.
@SenSchumer and this because You support illegal workers in our nation. Oh, the irony!
We thank you, Debbie.
When will the President Make America Great by weeding out the Russian influence?
Intelligence "leaks" or "whistle blowers"? It took THREE weeks for the President to accept General Flynn's resignation.
@SenSchumer now we must rid ourselves of the EPA man
A win for workers? How is that? Do you have any substance behind your allegations? NO. People do not see this a win
Workers of the World Unite!   (there is no #Soviet #Flag)

@SenSchumer well, let's hold off celebrations til we see who's next
@SenSchumer bye bye
@SenSchumer Thank you! #persist
@SenSchumer @NBCNightlyNews it's called bullying! Most liberals frown upon it...unless they are the bullies!
thank you for your hard work, keep fighting them! Now on to investigation, DEMAND IT for us all!
@SenSchumer #dumphardees
@SenSchumer meet your new nominee: @ScottWalker
@SenSchumer you'll get the same with the next one and you won't be able to smear him.
@SenSchumer @NBCNightlyNews What has the Democratic party done to workers? they give millions to the Union but not workers
@SenSchumer @NBCNightlyNews Ask him why and he would probably say because he doesnt have time for cry baby Dems.
@SenSchumer what a bunch of ignorant people here. Better get the real facts before you open your mouths. Schumer at it again.
@SenSchumer he'll just put in another millionaire clown with zero experience.
@SenSchumer THANK YOU!!!!
@SenSchumer Fantastic!$
Just didn't matter when opposing DeVos because there wasn't a video of an ex detailing abuse. Very sad.
@SenSchumer Thank you so much for fighting!
Too bad there wasn't a win for students in public schools.
@NBCNightlyNews He doesnt want his life ruined by the NSA!!! Better watch - they are listening to you too Deb!
It's a good win for the American worker. Well done!
Thank you for listening to and hearing us.
Randm unregistrd handgun murdrs, crazd semi-automatic mass shootings, & rampant drug overdose deaths r DYING AMERICAN HISTORY.
.@michaelbrollo @SenStabenow You're one keyword phrase away from a visit by the Secret Service, sir.
Thank you!  This guy was very ill-suited for the job.  We got to say "You're not Hired"
We need a win for America! Vote for Kid Rock next election! Goodbye Stabenow!
Ha ha ha. HAHAHAHA! Heh. Oh wait, you were joking, right?
Michigan is disappointed in you Debbie! We'll see you #Nov18' Your party's constant bullying and hate speech will be its demise
.@f39301884eb94ce @SenStabenow Wrong. Many in Michigan, no matter their party, are proud of our Senator.  You don't speak for all.
Well he speaks for the majority.  Sit down and shut up.
Now we need a win for the environment and our planet and prevent Scott Pruitt from being nominated
They paid me good wages in Calfornia I even made crew leader at 16 But fast food should be a career.
Brava, Senator!
This is the guy who threatened Carl's Jr. workers who wanted a $15 minimum wage. Thank God this guy got sent packing. 
Thanks for fighting, Debbie!
Thank you, ma'am!
