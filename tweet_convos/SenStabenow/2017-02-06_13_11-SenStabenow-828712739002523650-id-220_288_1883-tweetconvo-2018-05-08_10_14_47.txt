Debbie: So you don't want to return responsibility for & access to good education to parents - NEA giving you too much money!
no, she does not want to give vouchers to the church, thanks Debbie!
That would be the parents deciding that the best use of THEIR MONEY would be to send money to parochial school
parents can be stupid too!
Of course parents can be stupid-but that's their individ right: allocating responsibility to gov't = dependency
There's no accountability in private schools. If you want to send your child there, go ahead.On your dime.
Classic big govt answer: Parents can't choose - need govt restictions to manage their own money/kids
no problem with choice.  - problem when govt treats schools like business
Stop EVERYTHING until we have the truth about the tampered election &Russian espionage. #DworkinReport #ImpeachTrump
Thanks for trying Debbie! We know you're up against tough odds but glad you're on our side!
.@SenStabenow thank you for your words and efforts. #NoonDeVos #noDevos
- Thank you for your efforts.
Appreciate you standing up to say #NoOnDeVos!
Sad every time you speak no substance just talking points
Please stay seated and quiet.
And she's in.  DeVos confirmed.  YOU LOSE......again.  Get to the back of the bus.
might be time for a senator that cares about children more than Union money !!!!
YOU WILL BE OUT OF A JOB NEXT ELECTION! Your party is Disgraceful which is evidenced by losing so many seats across the land
Thank you for representing Americans desire for quality education & voting #NotoDeVos #holdthefloor #JustOneMore
Thank you Senator!
We will will speak against you in the next elections. Goodbye to party politics! Go America!
Tell them the only qualifications Betsy DeVos has for education is writing checks to educational charities for a tax deduction
wrong, she should, and will be confirmed.  You don't support better education, just public unions.
Please vote NO.
thank you
I don't understand why your against inner city kids and parents having access to better education opportunities.
Thank you for opposing DeVos for Secy of Education
you are being so disgraceful and embarrassing! You should be ashamed Debbie!Confirm Betsy and rest of cabinet! RED state!#Nov18

Thank you for your no vote and your efforts to convince others to vote the same.
Thank you for representing me.
thank you Senator!  We are behind you all the way!
Michigan public schools ranked bottom half of us last eight years but Betsy devos is your problem? Hypocrite.
she knows absolutely nothing about education. That's scary. If you can't see that then you're the problem
so the last two soe did yet these states ranked in bottom? So who is wrong here? Give me facts not your opinion
Thank you, Senator Stabenow!
I am a teacher who was fired from a charter school for speaking against oppression. Thank you very much.
that speech should be short because that nominee is terrible
Because she has millions of her own and the NEA can't buy her like they can washington insiders.
We all know you get your backing from the MEA. & NEA you could care less about education.
I am a lifetime member of MEA NEA
Betsy DeVos SHOULD be Sec of Education!!
Thank you Senator 
As a Michigander I know first hand about The DeVos propaganda machine. NO 2 DEVOS
I'm thankful for school choice in Michigan! #IStandwithBetsy
Great job Debbie!  Thank you!

Thank you Senator!
Thank you Senator!!!

Thank you
thanks for the numbers
Speak for the kids who have bad parents that don't care and tell them Public Schools are those kids refuge, hope and future.
you go girl !
You go, Senator!
the unions must have pledged big money for your upcoming re-election bid, start doing the people's work and vote yes or no
It says a lot about how bad devoss is that she doesn't support her. Keep public schools strong.
Here in Mich. We see how that worked. It didn't. Devoss was a key driver in the failing experiment.
Always enjoy intelligent disourse. Education is not his or your strong point.
. I didn't get to where I am in life by being asleep. Devoss wants religion in schools and I do not. No vouchers.
