.@SenStabenow @TheDemocrats stole the nomination from @SenSanders. We can't trust a word any of you say. You Built That!
senator sanders is not a democrat. He should have ran his party.
.@Jaxgma3235 @SenStabenow @TheDemocrats 

 @SenSanders has been siding/voting "with & for" @TheDemocrats his entire career. That's a fact!
but he's not a democrat. After he lost he registered as independent again.
.@Jaxgma3235 @SenStabenow @TheDemocrats 

@SenSanders is also now a member of the DNC leadership. Can you comprehend that fact?
yep. But he should have ran as independent can you comprehend that fact??
.@Jaxgma3235 @SenStabenow @TheDemocrats 
@SenSanders is wise, did what was needed to get the coverage he would have otherwise been denied.
Agreed! We may not have realized how corrupt DNC is if he ran Indie
@stipton #untrue.
Willing to listen. Show me. @VPUniversity @SenStabenow
She must prove her assertions are true. It's not up to me to prove them false. It's her claim.
I buy that. However, if you say they're false, shouldn't you be able to say why? @VPUniversity @SenStabenow
They are false because she's saying things as fact that have not occurred.
That's a good point. So, let's see if the good senator has any facts to back up her info graphic. @VPUniversity @SenStabenow

Thank you. I'll ask you, do we throw the baby out w/the bath water? Why is having needed healthcare polarizing @VPUniversity @SenStabenow
Scare tactics like this are why you lost the election, you are out of touch with the electorate
Trump taking the oath
see how that works?
Try to keep up.  They do have Consequences.  Get ready to pay them.
"back of the bus" LMAO at Trump voters who think they won something. #MAWA right?

The Republican Health Care Plan   #TheResistance 
make sure they don't skimp on the ducks
@SenateDems Not all are bought but most are, especially the repukes!
Where is a PUBLIC copy of the plan?
@SenateDems You guys voted Omnibus bill in that made cuts to Medicare last time. Hospital says Medicare won't pay for Epi pen.
yes and there about that many who are on it only because they would be penalized $$ wise if they didn't. !
@realDonaldTrump @SenStabenow  Average grassroots American citizens do not believe a word you're saying on OBAMACARE! #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA
 Low IQ Brain Dead Does Not believe Facts & the Truth!
The Constitution was created to please some small racist states and it still Does
great summary great graphic
FAKE NEWS STARTS WITH U! Had it for 8 yrs and it's so F'ed up now! Ur type needs to fall under our health care & our retiremt.
Liked it a lot better before govt got involved in our healthcare.  At least then I had good insurance.
More liberal fake news. I'll take my chances
Obama care is awful.
big pham has the money to advertise everyday on tv, millions every second spent,  why not have them pay for ACA?
This means that Democrats MUST BE READY to pounce on this MAJOR mistake by Repubs. Make 2018 their Waterloo
@SenateDems That's because the insurance companies pay the off the politicians.
stop with the lies. This is not the plan and you know it....this is why union families voted trump
and they will find away to blame Obama
Insurance companies should be in charge of insurance. You've proven that!
This cannot happen. People are poor enough without paying more. Please figure out a way to stop this. Thanks.
@SenateDems so we should stick with your garbage Obamacare until you create a single pay system? Never gonna happen. Give up
OMG.  I just noticed.  Are you seriously a United States Senator?
Republican plan has not yet been announced, fool.  Dem shifting of 10 million to Medicaid welfare ain't healthcare reform.
like the status quo is working !!!
Americans just got finished telling you to shut up and sit down. @SenStabenow
just like that sham #Obamacare did
Anything is better than having GOVERNMENT in charge - that's a fact!

tell me how ACA benefits me? my costs keep going up. As it stands, benefit vs costs, I get nothing. So no thanks #byefelicia
This is unacceptable!
@SenateDems get a grip! #lies
Debbie, come on, the insurance companies have always been in charge...
that's right!
you'd rather support what's killing health care for the average working families.  You're sick!
No it doesn't quit lying to voters.. the repeal has nothing to do with Medicare/Medicade it has to do with Mandates
repeal Obamacare: increase Medicare prems: open donut hole, increase deficit. Gopukes get vouchers, ins cos in control.
@melissagarrison Sick of people bitching about ACA. Before ACA rates went up yearly. Don't like it? Buy through employer.
Agreed!  Scared at the thought of going backwards! ACA does save lives and families from bankruptcy.
Absolutely! Seems people would rather get sick & not pay Dr/hosp bills or die. Time to be adults.
No one understands the true cost of life threatening illness until they or close family needs healthcare.
So true! Unexpected illness/accident puts families in financial ruins. Ins benefits factor for my job choice.
....and the crowd cheers...for some reason 65 million thought bank bailouts, foreclosures and layoffs were great times. 
Exactly!  Their entire modus vivendi, give big business carte blanche to exploit Americans with impunity!
We don't want our life expectancy dropped to age 40 or so and refuse to #MakeAmericaSickAgain
insurance companies need to be regulated.
They will also put thousands of healthcare workers out of jobs! @gbmnyc
Oh my God.
thank you for your leadership on this vital legislation. #standupforus
exactly
@Dijo49 Expand healthcare DO NOT ABOLISH IT! OTher countries have it..we are antiquated! My private ins. Copays have increased!
So afraid of that... I'm a trauma nurse & treat everyone the same--great insurance or NO insurance#MakeAmericaSickAgain
anything is better than having the moronic government in charge
most seniors are killed by high drug costs!
they are in charge now, you have forced people to by their products or be fined...talk about choice or Gov enslavement
Thank you, Senator.
Follow the money.
@LuvPlaying what plan
exactly-no legislative plan-just the logical outcome of dismantling ACA. Don't need document to see plan.
I never believed all those insurance lobbyists and their $$$$ went a away
Can not the GOP see that the 'fox guarding the hen house' never works?
,/",x;xxx;x
Two Phone Numbers- 202-225-0600 and 608-752-4050 Call often- Keep Obamacare (ACA)
Drugs are overpriced in America already - big insurances companies do the talking control.
so Obamacare is a success because our costs skyrocketed, but just not as much as 8 years ago? Must be all fixed! Good job...
you Dinosaurs got to GO! You neo liberal democrats are done!GET OUT!
...you stated that they didn't have a plan. Which is it?
no time has Mr Trump said he was cutting Medicare or Medicaid that is a Liberal lie stop the madness.
no, the GOP/Paul Ryan want to cut it. Trump needs to keep them from doing it.
I thought Reagan's idea was to drown fed govt in bathtub. not actually Americans.
anything is better than having the government in charge of insurance.  Hopefully term limits are on the horizon next!
thank you for continuing to fight for the health care that so many Americans desperately need/deserve!
thank you for fighting for health care for all Americans!
2 our faces, they R watching our back.  Reality is they have other employers (lobby firms) who pay more, search lobby scandals.
Lobbyist opposed & won a Medical Device Tax that would have contributed millions 2 AHCA. Y?  We all pay taxes, Y not them?
R professionals who petition, bribe & make campgn contributions 2 members of congress 4 favorable laws concerning their industy
Insurance co's have 838 lobbyist, of which 477 R former congressmen, they R called revolvers.  Lobbyist.............
Medicare negotiated 15% discount against an industry that has in some cases, 1,000%  mark up. This is why medicare is in trble.
Drug companies can ban together as industry, 2 name "their" price. Medicare must negotiate against a monopoly................
Taxpayers, visit Wikipedia, Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 view Legislative History.  Congrs gave drug co's a monopoloy...
@SenateDems Happy New Year 

https://www.facebook.com/groups/46727177940/ …
Really? I recall a large amount of $$$ being paid to insurance companies for "loss of profits" because of OCare.
you mean the Heritage Plan that was modified to give us the ACA didn't already put them in charge? Stop lying to us.

@HighFiv49807762 if it's the wrong thing it's the Republican
it's time to expose ins. Co. for the embezzlers they are ripping off Americans for decades
unacceptable!!!
@wikicircus Ethical members of congress need to start exposing & prosecuting the blatant corruption of GOP. Go after Them!
You LIE  thats why Republicans control the whole show now.  Dems LIE LIE LIE Blah Blah Blah irrelevant and impotent
BS! if this epic failure of healthcare is so good why aren't all of you on the hill on it? WTP hate it!
Misinforming the public. The Insurance companies are in charge. You should call them profits over health.  @terry7531
dont forget that millions of kids 18-26 wont be able to have parents healthcare
@WeTrustEllison  Exactly what Hunt is trying to force this country into
@ Speaker Ryan guess Republicans want millions of seniors to committee mass suicide
@SenateDems don't let them, obstruct and block
Don't let GOP repeal the ACA! Without looking to adapt or having replacement, they will throw the baby out w/ the bath water!
@kae_engel Then and only then will I have any faith in them to do the Right thing. We had Faith in Obama, they just obstructed4
@kae_engel on Thursday, to hope it gets you to Friday, to worry about the medical Bills, more than a life threatening illness 2
@kae_engel If the members of our Legislation, had to live in the real world, know what it's like to "put a dollar" in the car 1
You are right & we talk about #WaysToImproveObamacare but nobody who is a politician is POSTING on the actual topic
Adorable. Wait til you find out what a Democrat is.
@obsessivelyMe the obama care drove up the insurance and fine if you don't have it . All you ppl in power need to fix it now!
Don't you get it? We cannot afford insurance it wasn't -$2500 what part u don't understand? HRC win I'm pretty sure you'd fixIt
Michiganders are suffering under Obamacare - we cant afford it - especially those of us between 60 - 65!
Theyre already in charge, & nothing done to restrict pharma abuses. Be principled & maybe people would support you.
@SenateDems So long and thanks for all the LIES!
get out of politics you hack.
Fight back
Do you think we're so stupid we don't know ACA was written by and for ins and big pharma?!! Girl...
pet a puppy drink your hot chocolate! NOBAMA 16 days count them! WOO HOO!!!
Right, that worked so well~~~let's get back to that.  Let those who pay taxes pay for emergency rooms.
Add a repeal of Congress' insurance to any #ACA repeal bill #UnInsureCongress
#MakeAmericaSickAgain
Last yr we used savings to pay 4 ins. This yr it went to $3000 per mo. We no longer have ins in 2017.  Please repeal it!
keep fighting for senator. Michigan is lucky to have you.
Please explain how making a 29 yr old pay a $400/mo premium with a $6,000 deductible is insurance????  This is a joke, on me.
BACK in charge? Have you been living in a cave for the past six or seven years? #Obamacare
So much BS from you guys that's why will make America sick again
Still triggered?  Aren't you suppose to see your doctor for triggerings lasting more than 40 days?
it's a trainwreck- stop
@macushla7 vote NO...
| @RealDonaldTrump said he would not cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security.  We're going to make him keep that promise.
but congress has contradicted him. It's congress people need to keep an eye on
@datagoodies When has the GOP planned to restore healthy water to Flint? Living there is unconscionable. lack H20 is demented
@SenateDems love it! Stick the solution of "Trumpcare" to the Republicans! Stay on message, educate & disseminate!!!
Voting for ignorant Democrats like @SenStabenow is what #MakeAmericaSickAgain. #Obamacare like your party a disaster for America #uniteblue
insurance or being in charge or government? Seems like a catch-22
@SenateDems Iove it!!  Stick the solution of "Trumpcare" to the Republicans! Stay on message, educate & disseminate !!
@JamesEFinch When will they introduce the repeal the repeal legislation?
This is untrue BS rhetoric. The plans presented previously keep key provisions. Quit lying & put Americans b4 party lines pls.
Umm. Maybe you should talk to Doctors and patients that have Obamacare.   DENIAL
what a stupid #! How about#TERM LIMITS!
.@SenStabenow But you guys keep telling me GOP doesn't have a plan!
@SenateDems more bullshit from the libtards who OWN the disaster that is Obamacare, the Democrat Socialist Party
@Willie_Jacobsz Will U urge Senate Committes to demand production of Trump Tax Returns as a condition of confirmation hearings?
3 certainties in life:

@cavlovic_k A workfare program brought to you by the Insurance Lobbies of America.
ACA- a way for Dems to create more damn Beareaucrats, control/ruin people's lives and grab a 1/6th of our economy& Liberty dies
amazing how you can lie like you do
Reply to @SenStabenow news flash, cost are already insane, another year with rising premiums no one will be able to afford it and pay fine
the only thing bipartisan about #ACA is that #Dems voted against it.
@AlexCSinger16 65million Americans did this to 20 million Americans Probably some of Themselves! Duh! Swift! Now watch Fallout!
How Government! How Rich Businessman! How UnAmerican!
drive up costs? How could they get any higher?
Your tweet is currently ranked #3 on the #MakeAmericaSickAgain scoreboard! http://tagr.us/2h8/SenStabenow 
With all my respect Senator, that is not true.
Hey Senator, why don't you wait until you see what they plan on proposing, jumping the gun like usual, #Obamacare is failing
Republicans don't care.
do you drink your own kool aid? How many seats can democrats loose defending such an unpopular bill? Over 1000 wasn't enough?
insurance co a r still in charge w/no govt opt but got to keep Ocare now until can get something much better
Ok. We should listen to a Dem who voted for that mess ! Seriously.
Not even close, obamaCARE is huge FAIL!!
@SenateDems America is already sick. You could have helped and passed the plan you advertised.
People I know with Obamacare hate it.  Forced to have it, high deductibles so no monetary advantage or useful healthcare.
think it is such an awesome plan? Participate in it and watch what really happens
the costs have skyrocketed, unless one is a Senator, Congressman, or President. Then you are exempt.
@egregory962 thank you!
@SenateDems Good campaign slogan. Call your Congressional representatives #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@SenateDems Please continue to fight for Affordable Health Care.Thank you for all you do for all of us.
- KEY WORDS - INSURANCE COMPANIES BACK IN CHARGE!!
Really!! This is exactly why you all LOST! Grow up and GET A GRIP!! Stop acting like crying little kindergarteners!
. @SenStabenow @Donna_DHKBB #ACAWorks Call #speakerRyan 202-225-0600 Tell him No repeal of #Obamacare
Good news - busy signal.
typo.. STOP trying to mess with our lives!
. "Islam" literally means submit and surrender.  So doing it with the lives of the average American person who is a US CITIZEN
. We see that you have submitted and surrendered yourself to whatever your failed party's plans are. Look up the word "Islam"
Bttr yet, READ Koran. If after, u still don't undrstand real dangers Islam, ur comprehension needs massive work!
. Successful.  You can't put Obamarama care in the same sentence as successful.
i don't believe you've read this carefully enough.     Stop trying to hit the panic button.  The people working on this are
who came up with the hashtag #MakeAmericaSickAgain ?
how the heck do U NO. U have not read the ACA yet! just like pelosi!
DEB I saw U on TV. I bet you had a face lift at our expense. Did you=fess up ole deb!
Drive up costs lol....little too late for that isn't it?
@rhUSMC hey Debbie downer its not insurance when the deductible is $6800 plus and higher for families. Imbecile.
NONSENSE ! HAVE YOU OR FAMILY TRIED OBAMA CARE ?  ITS A NASTY SOCIALIST SCHEME  , NEAR AS BAD AS VA ! WHATS YOUR PLAN ?
@mimizelman that is what we need to make the insurance companies richer!
NO DOUBT ABOUT any of those items!
the government should never be in control of healthcare! The Dems should never be in control of anything
