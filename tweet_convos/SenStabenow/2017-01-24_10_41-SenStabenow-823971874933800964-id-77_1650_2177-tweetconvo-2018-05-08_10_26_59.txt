So Debbie, My wife doesn't need maternity care.  Why should she pay for it? Please explain. Insurance companies understand that<
I have no kids in school, so why should I pay?...see my point?
That's my point also.
healthcare is even more important as it is a matter of life and death in many cases
Agreed.  I'm not sure what I am arguing about any more.  I'm at work supporting liberals on welfare.
might want to take a count of the states getting the most welfare
Oh I know.  Detroit is sucking Michigan dry.
isn't the entire govt of Michigan republican?
Are you serious? Where do they find these people? Heads buried in sand.
They are the definition of 'elites.' The very people DJT convinced his  he'd fight against.
elites are usually educated though.
they may be educated  they are not informed.  but they could have read something before their hearings. Clearly they don't care
Exactly! Some where probably born with the "silver spoon,"but did not prepare.
WTF at least skim a little prior #illegitimate
@SenStabenow You are stunning in your opposition to everything!
@SenStabenow Too bad you don't care as much about the babies that murdered by abortion.
@faithpeterson. While erectile dysfunction is in women basic coverage
@SenStabenow Price alternates stubborn defiance with evasiveness. Corruption and extremist ideology are disqualifying. Vote no!
"stunned"? No. Remember, many of us watch the unfair/biased/ridiculous cross-exams of nominees as though crimiinals
Funny Debbie, you are a fool
@maggiemahar general problem with US health policy: too complex, few politicians care to know details
@SenStabenow vote no to Price for good & protection of all citizens.
you better retire!
@SenStabenow he will do more harm then good
@briancolfer What  republicans have to offer or display is only their flat ignorance. Intelligence is not in them, it never will.
You have lost my vote next election. Democrate gone Republican. You stink Senstor!
I've watched parts of this hearing, could be called, "The Education of Tom Price"
these guys are completely out of their minds!
@Plantflowes THATS MY SENATOR! #Michigan
@PaulBegala Stunning!!
thank you Senator Stabenow
@VirgoJohnny  well said!  Affordable health care for All Women. As well as Sterility for men and women!
Proof, please.
Years ago, before ACA reform if you purchased insurance outside of employer they also denied organ transplants.
@SenStabenow Foolish statement. Quit stupid gotcha questions and do work for nation. Here in midst of carnage just want results.
@chipfoxx These men don't even understand what they're taking away from women. Priceless.
@AmandaJK12 And this is why an orthopedist is not the right doctor to help fix healthcare in the US. #priceiswrong
An orthopedist who appears to participate in insider trading and proposes laws to help industry instead of patients
maybe Price should school himself in women's issues
There's a pattern here. Trump's nominees know very little about the cabinet positions to which they're being appointed.
Stabenow is like "Look sweetie, I know you're new here but let's make a couple of things clear, kay?"
@lmcd9999_l It smacks of "Not my problem because penis."
@PaulBegala there was also a time when pap smears were not covered but Viagra was!
@clylealt and I'm stunned he is that ignorant.  Guess I shouldn't be.   After all, he is a Trump nominee.
@PaulBegala it's really a shame that men can't get pregnant, if they could perhaps they would have a different opinion
@gates_mcfadden make abortions illegal. Take healthcare away to properly care for children. People die. I am disgusted.
I'm stunned this guy is the nominee..he should know his chit!
@PaulBegala
@PaulBegala a sad and tragic play that we are all in the middle of with so far unknown consequences

@PaulBegala unbelievable.  All anybody in the GOP paid attention to was the word "Obama" in Obamacare.....
Basket of deplorables so some bound to get thru. See Tillerson.
Try blinking along with him to get a real feel for the moment.
shocking....a Trump cabinet pick has unknowledgeable on the subject matter they will be charged with overseeing?!
@PPact He is bad for women and women's health
ANY woman in the country could have told him that! Healthcare has always been tilted against women.
@PPact on my 1st plan female non smokers paid higher premiums than male smokers #priceiswrong
@PPact
BREAKING: New undercover investigation shows @PPact doesn’t help women who want to keep their babies.

@LilaGraceRose you should totally get in touch with me, I have a bridge for sale!
lame and weak. It is what it is. I know it's hard to accept for baby killers.
@SenStabenow And now the older people pay enormous premiums!
Do you suggest women were paying higher premiums than men? If so, would like details. This is a story that needs to be told.
It's a story that has been told. Try google. Here's an article to start you off: http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/11/29/503713772/women-could-pay-more-than-men-for-health-care-under-trump …
.@CAPAction @charlene_rallo Tom Price is slightly out of touch eh? #justaskawoman
Ask him how much he pays a year.  I bet he doesn't have a clue
I pay more now and was forced to have a plan that had maternity benefits when I can't even have babies. Stop your lies
I'm not having kids by choice. Point is, allowing up-charge for maternity svcs result in women paying more overall.
@bett1230 DO NOT confirm #TomPrice. He is venom and certain death to millions of seniors. #Medicare
@AtticusinCanada He doesn't care
@SenStabenow time for some #Womansplaining.
He did not answer the question, whether no one will be worse off under any new plan. #ourrevolution
Stunned to learn should be this cabinet's catch phase @DCdebbie
@doctorscience thank you Senator Stabenow
Shame on Price
stabenow cannot school anyone she is an empty suit and a drag on michigan. plus she had a face lift at our expense
@SenStabenow that's my senator!!
so much privilege.
GOP plan : access to health care IF you can pay for it. Otherwise go bankrupt or die if you get sick. Callous and disingenuous
The fact that he doesn't know this is stunning. Further proof that @realDonaldTrump & his cabinet are uneducated. #Resistance
He acts like women know exactly when theywill get pregnant. Fat chance of that, now that birth control isn't funded.
Just Say No.
No, you.
Face it; A lot of these Repub's, even "doctors," r elitist sociopaths & their followers r American monarchist
Most of the medical students in my university are for the repeal of the ACA
I wonder why? could it b electronic records or the insurance prem. refunds to insureds?
@vintagegoddess The cluelessness is terrifying.
Right. He's a fucking DOCTOR and had no idea women paid more before the ACA.
Price thought this was an "alt-fact".
