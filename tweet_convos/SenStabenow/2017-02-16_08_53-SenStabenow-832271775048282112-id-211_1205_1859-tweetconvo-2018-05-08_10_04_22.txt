Do women have more health costs? @SenStabenow @SenateFinance
I'll read UR answer when I return from my OB/GYN apt
Which I (a guy) MUST pay 4
women don't have prostates but we have to pay for your appts for that
.@emmabeckerman1 @SenStabenow @SenateFinance Prostate exams are usually part of an overall health exam. Just as basic breast exams.
they are still services I won't use that I pay for. It is how insurance works
I agree not having to pay is much better idea. But ACA forces you to pay. Why pay for services the other sex doesn't use?
we all pay for services we don't use/will never need. It is not fair to make women pay more simply for being born female
Fair is paying for services U receive
What's not fair is forcing ANYONE to pay extra for something biologically not required
I highly doubt you would be saying that if the roles were reversed. And a woman going it a gynecologist once a year isn't 1/
Just another type of #economic #inequality pay #women less @ work, pay more for #healthcare
I support @EllisonCampaign 2be next chair of @TheDemocrats becauseWeNeedA DNC chair wh'll rebuild party from the ground up.
Well Senator when have you answered with just a Yes or No to any answer?
I'll bet a dollar if men used healthcare more but both genders paid the same, you'd argue women should pay less
Maybe do some research and find out the stats on that. Also u dnt know me. Don't pretend 2know my feelings on something.
I am surprised that you felt that was a personal attack. Maybe this site isn't for you.
I'm surprised u think I felt it was a personal attack.  I don't think u r in a position to tell anyone what they might feel
by the way, I just scrolled through your last 12 hours of tweets. Good lord. Take a break. Your published body of work.....
what ? What does that even mean ? lol stop reaching trying to find something to bitch about
Is there any Repub capable of giving a straight answer?The only thing they're good at is doublespeak and dancing
LMAO I meant dancing around the truth but now all I can picture is 45 and his cronies twerking through the White House 
@MsJulieOlsen @ChristySmithSCV  Did you guys see this? This is why we MUST get you know who to DC!
what choices for women when @GOP defunds PP, repeals ACA, pregnancy is preexisting condition & discriminates?
for women to pay more for hlth insurance bc all their choices were stripped away is a slap in the face by @GOP
"ain't I a woman?"
Thank you Senator. We constituents applaud your fight!
@SenateDems @SenateFinance What does a man pay for a Pap smear or for child delivery? Is the dif in fees for IDENTICAL service?
child delivery -- you realize there had to be a man involved to make that child!
Do you realize that only the woman delivers the child?
so women should bear the sole cost of finishing what a man helped start.  Sure.
Your logic: the tobacco grower should pay for your lung cancer because ..... Please be a critical thinker.
Have the police ever responded to you? Firefighter? Well, then guess what. WE WERE PAYING FOR YOU
The question was - do women pay more for health care - Yes, but not for IDENTICAL treatment.
Here's why women should not pay more. Men suffer more chronic illnesses.
@SeemaVe60454506 Ms. Verma YOU NEVER ANSWERED THE QUESTION. Yes or No???
They better take away testosterone and erectile dysfunction drugs too!!! That should also be optional coverage.
Evasion and supposition...her response was a back-handed "YES-women should pay more!"
So frustrating to get a song and dance rather than a honest answer.
what woman doesn't want maternity care covered?!
beyond maternity care, "women's care" also covers breast cancer screenings, pap smears, gyno visits, etc
women should pay more. They are more expensive. Men pay more for auto insurance.
@VirginiaMohlere @SenateFinance  no.
This lady answers NOTHING & is going to make some nice campaign ads against Trump. DEATH PANEL MILLIONAIRE SEEMA
she's under the impression that only women need maternity care, every newborn needs maternity care, boy or girl
@CMSGov needs someone who cares 4 all citizens & their healthcare needs! This nominee doesn't care 4 us women
Think you should get out some crayons and draw out what you asked, for Verma has no clue.
I suspect she answered but you didn't like the answer.
@KoriWasinger @SenateFinance free market gibberish, that is all their version of healthcare is
Vote "NO" for #scottpruitt for #EPA!
NO on #SeemaVerma. Conservative ideologue ILL equipped to manage #Medicare #Medicaid #ImpeachTrump #USA
thanks for asking. Republicans like to ignore or bate and switch. Painful to listen to them skirt the issues
This is rhetoric.Blatant discrimination-though she tries to deny it.What's her goal here? More money for Ins. Co
of course they shouldn't ACA prevented that
You think that's a simple question?  Men and women are different. Sorry to point that out.  Look at all variables. Wake up.
Just a "yes" or "no" question. She failed!
@MaryTrinetti @SenateFinance - ms verma is the worst type of human being - such a low life
The talking points. If you don't want maternity coverage, don't use it, but let others have it.
Seema Verna most certainly said that women should pay more for basic healthcare.  wow. disaster.
what a warped attitude
NO!
no.
she didn't 'get' the question. She's answering this on the basis of 'optional' coverage and not actuarial rating
ABSOLUTELY NOT.Seema shld b ashamed of herself.totally disgraceful.
Wld have loved for you 2 ask Her If She thght there was some question as to her gender. She must be Republican!
So, yes, she does think women should have to pay more for health services that are basic to them.
@Aroyaldmd @SenateFinance the only women that would opt out of maternity care would be those that can't afford extra costs.
Thank you for continuing to ask these questions. Obviously, she feels woman SHOULD have to pay extra for care.
Another disastrous candidate
The only answer is No
NO!
@MimiLeroch @SenateFinance for a woman should be an easy answer 1st hand experience
her answer was spot on. Yes/No questions are usually just gotcha traps.
@cherokeesher2 @SenateFinance not simple enough I guess
@MimiLeroch @SenateFinance That was some shady and evasive maneuvering! Thanks for your dogged pursuit but this one is hopeless
@lkjtexas @SenateFinance @Teekotan 
â™¡thank you! It's been a MANS world too long.
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance why can't anybody just answer a simple question??
so does that mean she is pro-choice? She wants women to make the best choices for themselves.
@sheenA_8886 @SenateFinance No!
umm what women would not want maternity coverage? Why can't any of them give straight answers!
@BryanDawsonUSA @SenateFinance waiting for the nod from up above
Seema Verma you are a disgrace. Really?All u had to say was a yes or a no. I think you meant yes
choice
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance Shameful.

In a roundabout way she just said she's pro choice since it's a woman's decision.  Right?!?!
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance #ridiculous
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance how is that a hard question?
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance   OMG!
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance   Is this idiot kin to Devos?  Need to swamp that gene pool!
@puppymnkey @SenateFinance I'd say that's a no from her
Healthcare is not a right,if it is I want food and housing for free #CosProject
Democrats making every issue about sex or race
#confirmverma did Obama get scrutiny for Marxists?
sounds like @KellyannePolls prepped her, she nailed the vague answers.  Next up - how to pivot!
Thank you for asking. Pathetic answer. #protectourcare
@SenateDems @SenateFinance thank you Senator Stabenow!!
Got it, it's up to women to choose whether they want to pay more for basic care than men. <sarcasm intended>
Men and women should contribute equally to health-care for everyone.
thank you for pressing for an answer. Why wouldn't a woman choose that option?
keep the good work going
Your question is not so simple.  Due to health or life choices, not all women need pregnancy coverage. #MsVerma
not all (no) women need prostate cancer coverage either, but...
Everytime repubs use words like "choice or access" what they are really saying is ~you are on your own.
I literally just imagined her tap dancing over the words yes and no.... LOLOL
Thank you Senator Stabenow! Keep asking the tough questions!!
prop tax rates are set to pay for schools or libraries.  If I don't have kids or use services, my rates are same
ridiculous!  Rates S/b same.  Across an ins pool, we can estimate by age & sex and set a rate for whole pool
Omg..deflect much???
@SenateDems @SenateFinance thank you for asking the hard questions. Clearly she thinks women should pay more.
shitting hell. Unbelievable!
@OrneryPiglett @SenateFinance Her answer is clear to me. She's saying yes, women should pay more.
either u can't read & comprehend or r being obtuse. go away, ur ridiculous
Do we pay Senators to show up for all their duties? Waiting for your answer, oh wait you're not here!
plain and simple the answer is NO we should not have to pay more.
she didn't want to give a straight answer but she clearly thinks yes, women should pay more
@stateofemotions
watching this is so frustrating! Answer the damn question!
Maybe she could make mention that she is a woman again. Didn't get it the first 3 times.
yeah, I wasn't sure by looking at her, even tho she said it twice, the 3rd time made it clear
@TifLamborghini
Thank you for your leadership. I am proud to call you my senator.
remember like your Doctor keep or Dr,like your insurance keep ins. save 2500 dollars ya all you Dems said it GTH
Women can choose what's best for their family?! Really. Guess I missed that in my insurance binder.
.@PPact @SenStabenow  thank you 4 standing up for women & our RIGHT to = coverage! Absolutely APPALLING that she wouldn't give a yes answer.
@SenateFinance Seriously. I mean, what about an unplanned pregnancy? Since they want to do away w preventative birth control,
it seems that unplanned pregnancy will become more common. Gotta have maternity &newborn care for women!
thank you for continually trying to get this weasel to answer the question. I'm proud that you're my senator.
@PhoenixWomanMN @SenateFinance Thank you Senator. You do a great job for Michiganders.
@SenateDems @SenateFinance they feel they don't need 2B accountable..repeatedly don't answer, thinking they R guaranteed a seat
Good job, @SenStabenow! Ty for advocating! It seems most of DT's picks won't answer basic, common sense questions due to hidden agenda$$$$$$
Reject her. Another moral degenerate chosen by Mercer family & Bannon.
@SenateDems @SenateFinance who chooses NOT to have maternity coverage????
So no Women should pay more because some may choose not 2 have children, also it cuts insurance company profits.
Do you think a Senator should have better health care then the elderly? Yes or No?
@PPact @SenateFinance I think Verma was pretty clear: yes women should pay more. Being a woman isn't auto sorority. Next please
women don't pay more for healthcare fool.
sure sounded to me like a yes
@kienanking @SenateFinance question to the senator,should anyone pay more for Healthcare based on any factor,if so which ones
@SenateDems @SenateFinance Maybe she means women will get to decide what to pay for services if they are best for them. NOT!
keep challenging them.  Outrageous
@emilyslist @SenateFinance thank you Hon. Senator Stabenow for holding the line on this issue.
I know one thing, I shouldn't have to pay for abortions and for women having babies.
@SenateDems @SenateFinance ...NO
I love your hair today Ms @SenStabenow 
@PPact @SenateFinance this is a constant sentence woman should make their own decisions. However they keep taking decisions awy
great job Debbie
@SenateDems @SenateFinance #you just want free abortion
@SenateDems @SenateFinance #only you
@SenateDems @SenateFinance she is not smart
Women should not pay more! How hard is that question? I'm tired of her song and dance talk yes or no!
Thank you, Senator!
@PPact @SenateFinance Jesus she's inept...
@PPact @SenateFinance So women should basically self-discriminate? Like having breasts and a uterus is a choice. The nerve!
would agree they should par more. Unbelievable. How is she even in a leadership position? Come on Senate
@PPact @SenateFinance really? Some women might not want maternity coverage? Oh yeah, the 1%.
who is this "woman"?????
For half of human race, tell Ms Verma the answer is NO.  She won't say it? Then vote NO on confirmation
I am ashamed at Seema Verma's reponse, find me one woman who wants to pay more for BASIC needs, no woman
@SenateDems @SenateFinance I am sick and tired of direct questions not being answered.
@PPact @SenateFinance unbelievable
This woman never learned about the birds and the bees, clearly.
this administration's diversion methods & trying to talk circles around questions they are asked is ridiculous
@SenateDems @SenateFinance Absolutely not! But the GOP doesn't think we are human, so...
@PPact @SenateFinance Women should not pay more for healthcare. They cover viagra for men, but charge us 4 birth control!
Ask her about her statement that poor people should pay more for insurance because "they know how to stretch a dollar".
@SenateDems @SenateFinance @CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez NO GENDER DISCRIM IN HEALTH CARE! WE ARE ALL BORN FROM WOMEN! #SaveACA
@SenateDems @SenateFinance Thank you for trying.
we're DEMANDING TOTAL GOVT SHUTDOWN OF SENATE UNTIL SPECIAL PROSECUTION FOR TRUMP RUSSIA TIES #TREASON
@SenateDems @SenateFinance nicely done.
arrest all. IUD should b offered and placed. Already there but recap HPV vAccines. Block CNN allÂ©Â®
.@SenStabenow @SenateFinance SOMBODY PLEASE SHOW HER WHERE HER VAGINE IS ASAP.
When have any of you politicians answered "yes or no"?  When in glass houses Mrs Stabenow.....
She is a great candidate!!!!
@SenateDems @SenateFinance VERMA IS A PART OF THE REPUBLICANS OVERTHROW PROJECT. 
LOOK IT UP. ..
GOD SAVE US ALL.
@SenateDems @SenateFinance No Vote!!
so...you're not going to answer the question then...
she actually has trump admin disease; answer questions from 2 days ago & they'll continue this ad nausea
when does she start mentioning Trump's record-setting electoral college numbers?
thank you for trying your best to get her to answer. She's a weasel.
@emilyslist @SenateFinance what a terrible answer. Women need maternity care because you never know what will happen in life
@emilyslist @SenateFinance no no and NO
yes. You use it more. Take your #Feminist #ProfessionalVictimhood n go #Fuckoff
family coverage is same for one child or 10.  Family with 10 kids uses it more.
Thank you, @SenStabenow! Thank you for standing up for women, for minorities, for the planet, and for justice.
Wow!  Go Senator @SenStabenow
No.
No, they should NOT have to pay more
@DrJenGunter @SenateFinance terrifying
As one of your constituents, Thank you for sticking up for my rights.
it looks like you're not going to get an answer. Shame on her.
Keep up the good fight!  Michiganders are proud of you!
Alas, in "Trumplandia" Women have to pay for everything.
@sherrilee7 @SenateFinance @aaustin0216 knock Her Out Of The Hearing They Know They Don't Have 2 Answer BCause If PDT FEAR HIM!
They Fear PDT & His Twitter Feed & Of Course His Vile Vile Vulgar Mouth!!!! But, Watch Out!
Should only rich people be all able to send their children to the best private schools?? Yes or no?
Where the dickens did tRump find this trash?
Thank you for being a voice for all women!
Thank you Mam! & may Verma rot in eternal damnation besides all other demons of hell @SenateFinance
Good question, sad she doesn't have the spine to answer that yes she thinks women should pay more.
I take that as a "yes"
agree with seema, if I don't need maternity why should I pay for everyone's. Choices, isn't that what the dems are all about
if I don't have a heart problem why should I pay for those who do?  You do understand how insurance works, right?
thank you Senator Stabenow
Her answer should have been a resounding NO.
So, NOW women have a choice? "You CHOSE to get pregnant, pay up." Thank you for pressing her on this, Senator S.
keep up the great work Senator we are proud of you in Michigan.
Women's health care is important. When women and children are taken care of, society prospers.
Unfortunately @GOP hates women or they never would have backed @realDonaldTrump
NO!
ins cost are calculated by stats. Age, male, female, where you live, credit score, etc. not a yes or no answer.
Proud to have you has my Senator! You make the women of Michigan proud.
u also make the rest of American women proud that u r one of r Senators wrking 4 all Americans
Obviously, as most Republicans believe, if you're wealthy you're healthy. If you're not, you're screwed.
Thank you @SenStabenow for getting to the point @SenateFinance
do you know how insurance rates are even calculated?  The rate is based on probability of the cost of care.
Thank you Senator for looking out for women and children!
