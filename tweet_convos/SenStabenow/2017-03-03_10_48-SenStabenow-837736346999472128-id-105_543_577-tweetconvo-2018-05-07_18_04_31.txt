.@SenStabenow @MLive  20% of Worlds fresh water. 35mil people's drinking water. This is a Non Partisan issues. Must protect The Great Lakes
@POTUS has support to make changes to eliminate waste, fraud, & abuse in Govt. agencies.
You approved Rick Perry. Start fighting Trump, not supporting him. Then maybe I'll listen to you crying about Trump.

@peterdaou @MLive Shocking! This tyrant is possessed with destroying our environment. This is criminal. #impeachandimprison
destroying our government, environment, schools, economy, military, healthcare, vetrans, senior
What did MI voters think Trump was going to do for MI? We've seen evidence of Snyder's priorities. Big biz tax cut.
. Exactly this. It's like Trump was inspired by the poisoned Flint water & means to ruin ALL MI water
We know you'll push back on this and we stand with you!
@senrobportman let's keep the Great Lakes #great
& he spends it going golfing.
please help save our Great Lakes, this is absolutely ridiculous to propose this cut!
@RepPaulMitchell, Representative Mitchell, what is your plan to address this issue?
it should be a state issue
Many things cannot be settled at the State Level! This is an International Issue!!!
agreed but the states should take the lead
Can't be just a state issue, states share lakes & Canada owns & borders Great Lakes too. International
Absolutely!!!
We already spend more than the next 13 countries combined on defense.  How many times over to we need to kill people?
@LoriWest2 @SenStabenow Three. At least three, maybe four. Or five.
@amyralston @MLive So @RepMikeBishop will you join in the outrage or just march to the GOP drum?
Pretty certain neither party in MI will stand for this.
@BrienLillian His vacation home is in Fl. so he doesn't care about Great Lakes.Maybe he thinks Canada will pay to clean them up
.@SenStabenow Trump is America's #LoveCanal, a #Toxic & deadly corporate puppet. #USPoli #Cdnpoli #Water #GreatLakes #ScienceMarch #Eco #GIE
@POTUS We need to protect our great lakes and our environment! Don't cut!
@trumpscarnage He needs to go before he ruins are country.
Please help the Great Lakes!
Canada/US share Great Lakes. Canada get vocal about this. @Potus: Okay to crap in neighbor's backyard & not flush
@garretellison please fight with everything you have to stop this!!
More money for the military less money for clean water in the Great Lakes! Are you surprised? The Trumpies are like it
From your constituent: please do everything in your power to oppose cuts in spending and protect our lakes #WaterIsLife
That will make America great again when Lake Erie is ablaze
what do you intend to do? How will you fight this?
As your constituent, I implore you to save our #GreatLakes to #KeepTheLakesGreat and stop trump from ravaging our water & land.
Y'all make sure U rememberTHIS in 2018 & 2020. Get out there & #resist

@Frazzling @MLive we spend  $600 billion on our military. No other country spends even $100 billion. Who needs lakes? #resist
Mar-a-Lago getaways for 6 weeks already cost more than this! #EPA
“It’s dead on arrival, it’s not going to happen, it would be a disaster,”
Agreed.   Great Lakes supply water to 40 million people&supply 80% of fresh water in US   Thanks for your strong support
WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR RICK FREAKING PERRY
@Jason4Danish @MLive drumpf will probably for everyone to buy trump water...I won't do it, I say...I won't!

Just heard about this today! Please save our lakes! 
You hearing this @LakeSuperior ?
@SenSchumer @SenGillibrand I remember dead zone Lake Erie & stinky Lake Ontario w/dead fish all over beaches in 70's. No cuts!
@SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @RepBrianHiggins Pls work hard to protect our Great Lakes & @EPA funding & regulations. No pollution
keep up the hard work of protecting our Great Lakes.  I am so fearful on what is happening with the EPA.  Thanks Debbie
Totally unacceptable. Thank you for standing up against his madness.
@peterdaou @MLive Michigan voted for Shitgibbon. What did you expect?
I bet if he had a golf course along the Great Lakes he wouldn't cut funding by 97%.
Are you still alive? How useless you are. Will you just go away?
Totally Fake News. There has been no decision on this from the EPA or POTUS.
How do we change this. Unacceptable.
Please do whatever you can to fight this!
And what was his reasoning for  drastic cut aside from wanting to increase military spending? Grt lakes don't matter?
@peterdaou @MLive THATS MY WATER TOO!!!!!  PROTEST @JustinTrudeau dammit
Mine too, Sophia US-Canadian Great Lakes agreement:
No, it's outrageous that you Senator didn't honor a fallen Navy Seal's widow at the joint session!
That is downright frikken fake news!!!
Saw it myself as I watched her...pictures don't lie, like people do, right?
Yes, yes it IS outrageous! I hope you will fight and work to persuade your GOP colleagues that this cannot be allowed!
think you should stop obstructing and delaying and get together with other state senators and do your job. Negotiate
called #Fascism, sorry, truth hurts

#Trumprussia #Resist #NoGorsuch #SaveACA #NoDAPL
Great lake states need to take care of the great lakes..
What has Stabenow done for the great lakes in the last 8 years?   Elections have consequences. Stabenow needs to go.
HE sucks. We know. Boycott business that pollute.
and with more pollution means a higher cost of filtering which will be passed on to the consumer
makes me sick what will happen to our beautiful lakes.

It's a US federal issue & INTERNATIONAL issue. The US has agreements w/Canada:

FIGHT! And keep fighting.
What a way to thank those people in MI, WI, and PA who voted for Trump!
I grew up in MI and I know how important the lakes are to tourism and the economy there.  Especially the UP.
@peterdaou  POTUS is setting up America to have its resources pillaged at an astounding rate! 241 years & it ends like this?
The "people" spoke I guess. Y'all make sure U rememberTHIS in 2018 & 2020. Get out there & #resist

@peterdaou @MLive Maybe somebody should explain to the people who live there and voted Trump that elections have consequences.
WORD!  Y'all make sure U rememberTHIS in 2018 & 2020. Get out there & #resist
Why did you block @kthalps ?
it really is crazy. the Great Lakes are our most precious resource. no budget cuts please
Michigan alone takes in $22.8 Billion in tourism a year.  This won't help.
Y'all make sure U rememberTHIS in 2018 & 2020
$10 million would be for what? To build an aquarium for the last surviving Lake Erie fish?
.@SenStabenow @deejay90192 @mfbusto11 @cblazina @RepSwalwell Don't ever hope that CORPORATE MSM will help US w/this1
.@FoxBusiness @JanMorganMedia DAMN TIRED of LIES that TAX CUTS for the GROSSLY OVERPAID are "good for economy" http://www.liberalforum.org/index.php?/topic/162455-we-need-more-tax-brackets;-not-fewer/?p=1059718565 …
@realDonaldTrump you do this Donny and Michigan will dump you like a bad hair cut!
@MJoyce2244 @MLive And Snyder says what?
@peterdaou @MLive Yup!!!!!
This program was dreamed up in 2010.  Just another slush fund for tree huggers.  Stop the sky is falling crap.
@peterdaou @MLive ahem thanks Michigan.
Fight @SenStabenow!
@peterdaou @MLive just a little thank you to those in the rust belt that voted for him #poorhealth #jobcuts
Make sure U rememberTHIS in 2018 & 2020
Guess we're gonna have to change our slogan to "Impure Michigan!
THAT is just the beginning..
Does @POTUS know water is REQUIRED to sustain life and The Great Lakes account for 20% of world's surface fresh water? @EPA
think of all the tourism jobs to follow the factory jobs that have left/are leaving Erie if the lake is unusable
Terrible!
An ignorant man who thinks he's smart is the most dangerous. Trump is a combination of ignorance and short sightedness.
@peterdaou @MLive Goodbye GLRI funding. Hello dirty water. Isn't Flint enough?
Sportsmen, boaters hunters and fishermen voted in large numbers for Trump. Hope they're happy when the lake stinks.
Or catches on fire
Good Friday,Sen. Stabenow, LENTEN GREETINGS
You better brush up on your negotiating skills
again money over environment
no what is outrageous is you voting for Rick Perry as energy department head. Is showing your true colors sellout.
little counterproductive when you vote in a man who wants to dissolve the whole department. Feel free to leave the Senate.
