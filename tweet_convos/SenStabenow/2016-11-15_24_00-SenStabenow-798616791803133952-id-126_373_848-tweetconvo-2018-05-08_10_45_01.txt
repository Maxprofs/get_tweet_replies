.@SenStabenow Yes, & you parroting Trump/Sanders lie that system = rigged against them delegitimizes our votes.
Donald Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon is the absolute wrong message to send to Americans. Our country needs to heal, not hate. 
Agreed. Please continue to rally colleagues in public opposition of this appointment.
thank you for speaking out! #StopBannon
thank you for speaking about trumps selection of bannor!  He is not someone I want in my home let alone the White House!
Since you can't even spell his name correctly, obviously you have no clue what you are talking about.
Beyond half court #UltimateFreeThrow: #ECElectors Make .@HillaryClinton President Dec 19 - Sign ...
Yes,  Treason is always the answer.
Its the Den Party that is party of hate. So Obama can have Muslim Brotherhood but Trump can't have decent Amer?
right. So why are you willing to work with and normalize that facist?
Speaking as one of your constituents: THANK YOU.
Thank you so much.
My wife and I agree......  Bannon is not good for America.
Thank you Senator, please keep fighting for all of us!
EXACTLY, SO WHY THE CHEAP SHOTS, TYPICAL POLITICAL BS.  WHY DO YOU THINK DEMS LOST?? UNDERSTAND? HE IS POTUS ELECT, HIS CHOICE.
If healing and not hating is what you want, maybe your side should stop the rioting.
Thank you, Senator!
Dem lawmakers: please carry a prop: screenshots from Breitbart while Bannon was officially editor; let people see.
@ghawtho1 Thank you Senator Stabenow.
thank you, Senator! I will stop harassing your offices now.
Thank you for speaking out against Steve Bannon. We can not support people with such hateful rhetoric.
Thank you!!
St. Louis Dispatch: Editorial: Trump, and America, can't afford Stephen Bannon's vile views.
thank you
Thank you!
thank you for standing up against hate #StopBannon
Please treat this appt like the  conservatives did @VanJones68 appt. Resist at all cisrs
Appreciate your message but you're trying to appeal to a humanity and decency that just isn't there.
we love you in northern Michigan !
Good Job! Thanks! You are making a big difference.
@brocanteuse1 wake up Americans remember 1765 you got rid of one tyrannical regime not to be replaced by another
@Ava_Jae Thank you @SenStabenow You speak for me as an American
heal from obama. Too bad you have no say.
I called your office this morning about this very issue - thank you for listening!
Burden of proof is on you. There is none. Saving this for the slander lawsuit. Also, you need to retire. Dem BS narratives lost
Remember when Obama said "Elections have consequences, and I won" @SenStabenow i guess now the shoe is on the other foot!
Time to send a few more bucks to Jim Demint and company.
Yeah! Try it Debbie maybe you'll like it. No one hates more than Communist's, I mean progressives, I mean Democrats.
Thank you!!!!
thank you. Please get in the ears of @SenSchumer & @SenGillibrand to take a tougher stance on this issue and deplorable man
thank you for standing up for all of us!  We need strong leaders now more than ever.
wipe your tears and take a stand when injustice has been done, no room for speculation
your party is the party of hate and intolerance if someone disagrees with your stance
don't let him get away with this!
Get away with what?  Winning the election?  There were 51 popular vote contests and trump won.
really? Perhaps you should look at your side that is rioting like 2 year olds
Hillary Clinton sent the wrong message to the American people. She is a criminal and idiots voted for her.
@SenateDems So stop hating and help heal it. Let's wait for a reason before causing a heart attack.
YES Debbie!  So proud!
@SenateDems and I expect you to fight it every step of the way.
@SenateDems the only hate is of the rhetoric and fear you are painting for nothing, prove your claims on bacon or SHUT UP!!!
oh but there was no problem when they're in the Obama Admin http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2013/09/07/mainstream-media-honchos-related-towhite-house-officials/ …
lol did you just link to a breitbart article to defend the former head of breitbart
lol. Yes.
@SenateDems   Trump has Steve Bannon. Obama had Harry Reid. We had 8 years of the wrong message, now it's the Democrats turn
@SenateDems Really?  You are kicking the idea around of putting Rep. Keith Ellison as head of DNC? Think about it!!
Thank you for standing up.
Thank you, Senator Stabenow, for taking a hard stance on the Bannon appointment.  Please remain vigilant - won't be last time.
thank you for leading this!
@SenateDems but it was ok for sharpton to go t WH every week
thank you 
@SenateDems the dems had the wrong message. Bannon won the race for Trump and down ticket. Suck it up, give it a chance. #MAGA
How deep  @realDonaldTrump with Mafia?

When are  @SenateDems + @GOP's Hearings, like JFK + RFK + Barry Goldwater?
Thank you for opposing anti-Semitism and hate!!
@SenateDems Thank you!!!! Please keep saying this!!
@SenateDems find a corner. Rot there
How old are you? (5) Do you have the intelligence to respond to the Senator like an adult?
do U and HE have the intelligence 2 not Storm the senate floor & breathe hate to the prez elect?
oh grow up!
@SenateDems @SenStabenow just do your job and shut it!  (Scottish accent)
Senator Stabenow needs to pull the PLAN out of her eye before she tries 2 pull the speck out of Trumps.
@SenateDems Be careful. Not sure they are smart enough, but this insanity could be designed to distract from something worse!
Did y’all see the danger of @HumaAbedin, or @HillaryClinton’s maid not having a security clearance?
I seem to remember a similar outcry when Obama had dealings with his Chicago minister.
not the same. Bannon has actually said - in court records- his hatred of Jews
http://lidblog.com/the-obama-administrations-anti-semitism-is-showing-again/ … It is an continue accusation. No doubt, true, trump be foolish to remove hiim
Trump's whole campaign was about hate &how it reigned in WWC to placate their fears of being dismissed.
@SenateDems Republicans should take to the streets and riot until the problem is resolved.
@SenateDems best appointment ever. Calm down!!
@SenateDems Trump I won ( not the Vote) So Go get Fucked!
- You're boy Obama hosts Sharpton regularly. C'mon lady...
Sshhh. It'll be ok.
.@SenStabenow says the senator whose party supporters are rioting and destroying property because they lost the election.
pic of 5 losers, and ole debbie is the biggest 1!
thank you! I emailed your office today regarding this, glad to see where you stand
Thank you Senator Stabenow!!! I called your office today about this!  cc: @amelianewburg
Donald Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon is the absolute wrong message to send to Americans. Our country needs to heal, not hate. 
Curious if Ds especially MI Ds have a plan to restore MI Blue? The time to start is now, before we end up with 8 yrs of this.
yes !!!  Thank you
So where were you with the healing over the last 8 years when all dissent by opposition was demonized?
Can you please get out of the election rhetoric mode #bringustogether #unite #donotdivide
.@SenStabenow Our country needs to fight, not heal, or we won't have a country. Please, channel more Harry Reid,  less Vidkun Quisling.
and you need to stop the petty partisan bickering, your side lost, again!!
Jeff do you often miss the point of conversations?
YES, thank you!
Thank you!
