I appreciate your perceived tenacity, Bernie, but Trump doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. @realDonaldTrump
for someone who doesn't give a "damn" how does he have thousands of employees? #fact
whatever you do don't let the truth get in the way of your opinion!
How do you know Trump has thousands of employees?
yeah owning building and resorts all over the world are staffed by who. Com sense 101
lol, you take him at his word?
I give respect to those for how they treat others, not for what they've managed to steal.

@Pats68 @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump
right so when Sanders backed Clinton who left 4 fellow vets to die on a roof how is that testing people right?
as a tax payer I demand you do a much much better job as being a Senator.  20+ years on their dime!
and I demand that out of you Sen. Sanders!  16 years congress, 8 Sen, your track record should b better!
How "we" going to do that? Your rabid supporters hate the rest of us
we don't hate y'all. We'll work together to ensure we don't lose everything. Or you could just have a pity party
Thank you for proving my point. Don't worry, I'm waging battle in my own way.
it's your choice. I'm choosing to leave the past in the past & move forward. B/c I don't want to lose everything
Well, frankly, you and Mr. Sanders should have been thinking about that a lot earlier. Carry on!
Are you willing to do your part to make things better?
I'm already doing it. Been doing it for over 40 years
Great. Then don't keep shutting down those who likely have similar ideals, so that you can remain "right"
Pity you did not keep yours ,@realDonaldTrump will keep his promises no problem .
I am totally confident #realDonaldTrump  is not a liar exaggerates slightly when the occasion call for it #LOL
#PresidentElectTrump doesnt lie its the #CorruptMedia s weird way of looking at what he says thats the problem
Because Trump is the only politician in US history who has ever lied, right? Spare me... @Pinklady66 @SenSanders
he is going to keep his promises, it is the new Rep mantra "Keep the promises to voters". @SpeakerRyan said so
trumpers make america trumpish again
We can and will demand he keeps his promises and he will laugh at us as he does what he wants.

He isn't on their side. This scam was to make sure the rich gets richer
oh yes we are!!!!
He was never on our side and we're looking at a pretty bleak future. Sorry for those who believed
NOBODY is going to hold him to his word. Sen Sanders. I have no idea why you are continuing this charade!
I have a feeling he will have an angry tweet for each one that says anything about it!
@realDonaldTrump/didnt Obama take outa Medicare funds Obamacare?Idiots,3000 page document,Congress didn't have a chance to read
might I remind you again that DJT is not even sworn in before you express your doubts...
PEOTUS worked his ass off during the election.he has a vision and plan for the country.he keeps his word...
and he couldn't give a crap. That is obvious in his appointments.
There should be a penalty for B.S. candidates that say stuff just to get elected. #stepdowntrump
Don't worry Bernie Donald isn't like U, he actually meant it when he said it U #HillaryAssKisser
guess we expect empty promises from Hillary. Are we holding #Trumptrain accountable?  Best of luck!
Please explain why no one seems shocked by his cabinet choices. Bernie, please ease my mind.
you should be in a nursing home.  He isn't president now
should we show sound-bites of you @SenSanders, along with @realDonaldTrump and see how that works out?
@NaphiSoc @realDonaldTrump - Donny boy is on his side and his side only.  When y'all gonna figure it out? #2016reallysucks
well bernie and debbie-get on the BIPARTISAN WAGON AND HELP 4 ONCE. walk the talk!
YES, PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP!  WE ARE WATCHING YOU.  AND REMEMBER U CAN BE FIRE ON 12/19/16.
Millions of you lost.
To the #oligarchy, a promise is inconsequential, only a gesture, weightless form, merely a recognizable sound.
He's a lying sack of shit who cares only for himself.  A fucking disgrace.
his words,even on videotapeare as worthless as his supposed understanding of the plight of the average American
Please keep reminding him about S.S. and Medicare.  Seniors cannot live without it.
@odeedee
what's with the hardline tweets? Give DT a chance. I appreciate your work though, eg S.2054, S.2023, etc.
He's an even bigger flip-flopper and liar than Hillary! We are ALL doomed if the forces that be don't help!
is unqualified because he lied. #LyingDonald @brezenoff #faithlesselectors
And he will Bernie! He has been a man of his word
If we start to work with our #POTUS than against him, he will do that if not more. WE THE PEOPLE!!
Thanks 4da love do me a fav & subscribe 2my u tube channel Aries spears & hit subscribe & also my pandora @ Aries spears

When is a liar not a liar? When he stops lying. #Liarsandcheats
hands off social security
talk talk talk! For votes votes votes the man in it for his self!
hard to remain in business as a liar. Politics is a different game.
hasn't attacked @SenSanders yet on Twitter. 
The only thing I believe that Trump said is he admires Putin! Dangerous liaison!
He's a racist bigot 'politician', of course he won't. His voters will find out soon enough
you really think he will? Seriously.
no, he needs ousted! Trump nor a man of his word #nohonor#no integrity #noloyalty#neverTrump.below the standard
Drained the swamp right into his pockets
Bernie educate him @ donut hole closing in ACA. Drugs killing SRS. Every friend need help fm drug pric#SRS VOTE
explain why we can't reform Medicare and Soc Security?
Way to go Bernie. About time you getting on the Trump train now repeat after me "Make America Great Again".
He is a self absorbed ;dar who only is out for himself.He's the first to tell you so.
Please accept that its now about lies and personal interest and we have no control. Indignation is useless.
Well he helped one senior lady retire early so far and believe me that was not easy .
@Phayd2Blaque @realDonaldTrump 
Sign this & prove it Trump!

Trump will NOT keep his promises! The question is WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT????
-you think?!
It's a stretch...a big one.
Hey Bernie, why don't you harass POTUS and talk to Trump after he is actually president.
Protect Medicare/Medicaid/Social Security from Wall Street Looters! @SpeakerRyan #ThursdayThoughts
Trump will deny saying this.
The election results are being investigated for Russian Hackers and some electors have vowed to NOT vote Trump.
Good Luck! Old School Charlatan got himself elected, disappointed supporters will appear in droves soon.
More of us should demand they kick him out.
your right and he lied to get elected he plans privatization of most of our safety nets another nightmare
you can't demand anything. You lost and the house and Senate lost.
we hope he will bring peace in the world
Now he says Carrier workers are to blame for job losses.
thank you Bernie Sanders!
you know in your heart this sociopath is going to do whatever he wants #imholdingyouaccountable #givehimhell
We are very happy with the changes he's made already. You really r out of touch Bernie
ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO ARM CHAIR QUARTERBACK??  YOU LOST, AND SOLD OUT TO HRC.  GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
he's a liar of epic proportions
Gray Power. Whether you care to join or not, Mr. Trump, your sparse orange strands are really gray. Watch out
what promise Obama keep? Wait only those who oppose u are a problem except obama and killary
Donnie never meant it.  He said it to dupe the dupeable.  WE knew.  THEY fell for it.
What are the sanctions? In OZ, we once had a PM who split core and non-core promises. Tossed him out. Trump?
#LordIHopeWeCan!
You BELIEVED him???
alternative... the Citizens of the USA files a massive Class Action Suit against POTUS #wespeakyourlanguage
he's a dirty underhanded liar with ZERO business being anywhere near #Washington
I will believe Trump when he shows his taxes. He is not in this for the people , It's the money!
LMAO
Sorry Bern, Trump is on the side of whoever he needs to Con in that particular moment.
OH bernie stop inciting discord try positive thought you mean old grumpy man
I think Trump has kept his promises, I.e., Carrier, Boeing, etc...Or do u not keep in touch with REALITY...
He forgot he said it on tape,jerk
Unfortunately, like so many other things this man has said are convenient lies to manipulate a naive public.
Go away Loser.People spoke and SAID NO TO BERNIE!
Donald Trump is only on the side of Donald Trump. We need a President Oversight Committee.
maybe you shouldn't have gotten punked out by killery maybe things would've been different lol #Trumpismyprez
Fat chance. He's lied about everything else he promised so far.
You can kiss Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, SS, public schools, the EPA, and the Middle Class goodbye!
doesn't keep promises. He tweets tho.
Promise? What promise? That was a campaign, I didn't mean anything by what I said. Any money in being POTUS?
Annnd what will you do if he doesn't?
fat chance of that. I'm guessing he is a professional promise breaker
he doesn't keep promises he spews lies
Bernie, your fight is w/ the wrong person. Join the team and come on in for the big win. Make Am Great again.
@carlyandjack @realDonaldTrump Amen Bernie!! U said it!!
Bernie, he doesn't care about promises.  Get real and get him out of there.
he only said all of that to get elected. He will only help the wealthy!! Should have listened to Hillary.
says what he means and does it! Not like any doofus lib! @Vets4Trump2016 @veteranstoday
Go take a nap at your New Lake or Seaside Resident. You're Yesterdays News! Trump'll do just fine!
When was his video taken?
Do not touch my Medicare or Social Security or Affordable Care Act
@SenStabenow @realDonaldTrump not Barry did and you. Have to pass it before you read it group
WE HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE TOO BERNIE! You supported criminal HRC. We trusted you. #NoDAPL #FREEREDFAWN 
You can't demand anything, you lost to a crook & sold out your voters! Not as influential as you think!
You have 3 mansions, you're not "us" Bernie.
LOL It's now grown to "Mansions"?!? Class Of Charlatans-#MakeMyRowHomeAMansionToo
SHUT UP! If you hadn't convinced your voters Hillary was no better than Trump, they might've voted for her.
Ryan sneak it in, Trump mostly  ignorant on the topic and damage to future retired? http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-medicare-ryan-20161114-story.html …
Paul Ryan collected SS when his dad died and he needed and used it to go to college!  Seniors need it to live
please keep your promise don't privatize Medicare or cut SS WE SURVIVE ON IT AND PAID INTO IT!
Do u @SenSanders believe he means anything he says unless it's all about him #pathetic
Is anyone surprised that he lied? And the ones that voted against their interest will deny it's Trump's lie.
That's the problem with Trump he says whatever anybody wants to hear to get their support then screw them!
is the real deal. The guy deserves to be the president.
with you all the way
stop tweeting @realDonaldTrump you seems fascinating by him... It becoming weird
He is obsessed. He can't help himself.
 yes
You do NOT speak for millions Bernie Faker, maybe a couple.
stop being so pessimistic, America first, get on the train and let's #MAGA. Start believing and stop hating
for fuck sake Bernie he's not even President yet, relax a bit grandpa
hold his feet to the fire @realDonaldTrump #Unfit
@SenWarren @chuckschumer @SenateDems  Watched vote on "The Cures Act" on C-SPAN. Wht happened? #CuresAct
did Soros really buy you your lake house, so you'd back down? Millions want to know
As long as Trump keeps mixing his business profits with Oval Office, he don't and won't care
you "people".. can't demand anything. When will you learn?
perhaps they can live in one of socialist bernies THREE houses.  Bernie is for the people.   Yeah right.
yeah we need to stay strong. This man is pathological
Insurance companies target healthy, wealthy people. The elderly poor will be the first victim of privatization
@stand4all @realDonaldTrump how's the lake house Bernie do you get pizza delivery there?
Are you trying to say owning a lake house is bad?  I wish he would invite me for pizza. @prepper1776 @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump
no I just asking
I would if he asked! @prepper1776 @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump
Why the ultimatums @SenSanders. @realDonaldTrump is not yet in office. Do your legislative job by passing all of Trumps policy. #MAGA
and that is the reason people don't  trust politicians nor media and the reason T won
good heavens if somebody comes in the media to hold her accountable
if H would have won she would be party after party, interviews, not have picked anybody in her cabinet...
yes keep him in check. Why don't wait until he swears. Imagine if H have won she gets this treatment bf swearin
he's a piece of poo
The problem with @realDonaldTrump is he lives in his fantasy world, out of touch with reality. #ITWONTHAPPEN
Bernie, Doesn’t matter what Trump said. Pence, McConnell, and Ryan are going to roll over this mental midget.
DT you need Bernie on your side...js
he'll never be able to follow through
@shailenewoodley @realDonaldTrump I really don't think he'll keep his promise and I think some of us agree
yeah, like he's getting rid of corporate influence? He's insane

Maybe you shouldn't have sold out to a crook.
