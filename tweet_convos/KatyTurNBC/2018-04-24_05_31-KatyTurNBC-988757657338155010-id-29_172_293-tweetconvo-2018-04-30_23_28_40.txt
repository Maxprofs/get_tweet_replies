Lucky for us women, we have the option of changing our name to John!
If gender is not supposed to mean anything why do you keep brining it up?
Good points. Fair enough. How many women are in the NYT editorial writing roster? While we’re at it, how many women or men bylines in your front and editorial pages are gentiles? Well if you want to talk disproportionate examples. Ah you will say why does it matter. Exactly.
Now do elementary school teachers
Did you assume John's gender?
Today I was the only woman in a day long executive meeting with a dozen colleagues.

1. Out of 13.
At a progressive tech company.

Thursday I'll be in a similar meeting for another business unit. There will be 2 women there.
Maybe that's because men outnumber women in technology by a significant amount.  Sometimes it's not about gender discrimination. #maga #resist
It's a systemic issue when 50+% of the population is so radically under represented.

For example, when women are actively discouraged from taking advanced math, you'll see fewer women in leadership positions.

You want to #MAGA? Then don't cut off 50+% of the talent pool.
Diversity inspires innovation! This status quo needs to change!
And that in a nutshell explains the world’s problems. It’s time for women to lead everywhere.
No ones fault
I can be a ceo?

Interesting observation. Convergence, data/research company focused on #alternativeinvesting, agrees with your findings and offers our own.  20% of leadership positions across #hedgefunds, #privateequity, #venturecapital, #realestate funds are held by women, up from 19% 4 yrs ago

Leadership roles in America where black people are excluded...
@nytimes : Gender is a social construct!

Also @nytimes : Men and women are represented disproportionately in outcomes!
You could do this breakdown for certain ethnic groups, too. Tell us, NY Times, how many Muslims are on your editorial board?

"If the FBI director, the national steward of investigatory ethics, leaks classified government documents with impunity, then who in the United States could be ever prosecuted again for such a crime?"
Nobody black though....but hey that’s not important
I can't believe this is still happening in 2018
Guilty as charged
