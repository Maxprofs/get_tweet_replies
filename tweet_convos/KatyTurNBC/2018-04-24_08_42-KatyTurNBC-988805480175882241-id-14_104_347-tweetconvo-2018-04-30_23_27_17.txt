Manafort was not brought onto the campaign despite his Russian connections, he was brought in because of them.
THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE = TRUMP
Of course not because it's a real thing and if he tried to he'd be in a whole world of hurt not to mention impeached.
What was Trump and Manafort's relationship of interest? @andyrosebrook
Wagging dog is only device he has that bears enough weight to bury other stories.
“Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." john adams
Manafort can have had as many shady dealings in Ukraine as he wants to. Some may even have been crimes. Guess what all that doesn’t prove? Russia collusion with Trump campaign. Guilt by association is a thing for third world dictatorships, not the United States.
Nixon was going to walk until Butterfield revealed TAPES. These people learned their lesson, there will be no connection.
Zzzzzz
But what we know predates Trump’s candidacy.
