Thanks, this one is a cover of a song written by my talented friend and producer, Ed Tree.
Great. Excellent guitar.
Ed Tree! Amazing guitar player too
This totally has me missing my mom. I know your mom is proud of you as well.
Very nice.!!!!!!
Wow!
Nice voice. Love the cover. Also, I spent the most boring night of my life on June 17, 1994 marooned by fog on Block Island, RI. Small island with little to do and that night NOTHING on TV except you know what! Tell Mom Thanks a lot! LOL
Nice voice!
Lovely...and timely!
Sometimes taking a few deep breaths is the only way to get through a rough time.
Thanks for sharing Katy. Beautiful and perfect for our times.
Very nice!
Y'all listen to this. Simple Folk music with a deep, introspective theme.
That's nice, love her voice and it's a lovely song.
Huh...and I can't help but think the fatalism of the song reflects what @ianbremmer is discussing in this talk with @AliVelshi ..
@soundgood2 good song for strange times
Not bad, but rather Calvinist in its outlook.

Reminds me a bit of Dust in the Wind ( I just heard on the radio this morning!) which was lifted from the Book of Ecclesiastes...

#RadioFreeMacedonia
And this song comes to mind too...I just a documentary on the Night of the Long Knives the other day...
Awesome!
Katy: how tall are you? A bio said you are 6’3”.  True?
Can understand your pride in your mother.
From little rocket man to honorable? He wants to use big words but not sure how? Ask Kellyanne moron!!!
Katy, he is fat enough doesn’t have to have steak dinners just waste our taxes money!
Very nice. You both should be proud of your work.  Katy, did you inherit her musical talent as well as the journalistic one?
 BRAVO 
Kinda sorta Ani DiFranco-ish. Lovely!
You should be proud, this is great! And I know she's proud of you too!
Very nice! I would be beside myself if my mom uploaded a good song to SoundCloud
