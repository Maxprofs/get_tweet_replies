Guilty on all counts. It’s already trending on here.
Katy Tur just accused Bill Cosby of faking being Blind
We know Cosby said “asshole” without your rather long explanation that you’re not allowed to say it. It’s tedious listening to some of the anchors attempt to relay quotes that include swears. Just say “a-hole”, “effing”, “p-word”, & “crap”. No need for all the explanations. Thx.
Guilty on all counts!
GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
Cannot wait for answer
Guilty AF.... literally
When do we hear
Looks like news media are aiming for the old jugular on the Bill Cosby decision? I expect the same attention from news media and #metoo on Donald Trump's infidelities and taking legal actions against him?
Can we move on from the car footage please
And it was the RIGHT one!! :^)
