“Lifelong grifter” will be in Trump’s epithet as well
*epitaph
Since newsrooms cut back of local news reporters, the nation didn't get to hear about this.  It's so important to have investigative reporters stationed around the country, maybe this grifter would of come to light sooner.
Well we know that Sinclair's news stations weren't going to report it.
It's not just Sinclair it took yrs for this to be reported, could have been reported alot sooner.
TY for the follow. Just read that article today. Sickening evidence of a massively corrupt person & mode of operation.
Might be the worst of the worst, but the competition is fierce in Trump's cabinet.
Yes, it's like the proverbial race to the bottom. Btw, I'm a 3rd generation Navy family member (ships & aviation) with a renegade older brother who went Army. Somebody has to, right? :-)
#GoNavy 
Love it.
We do, too! 
What is pointed out in this article is that the swamp isn’t just in Washington, D.C.  Trump brought his swampy behavior from N.Y. to D.C. and invited other swamp dwellers from other states to join him.
So when @realDonaldTrump campaigned on 'draining the swamp' he meant draining all the swamp critters from their home swamps into his personal swamp in Washington. He did say he would hire the best of the best - the best crooks, liars & thieves, & all arrogant and incompetent.
So it’s no surprise that he’s ended up in the trump administration? 
Being a "grifter" is almost a prerequisite for serving in the Trump administration.
GOP= Grifters of The Public
Where was the this story before the Senate voted to confirm him?
But @hughhewitt continues to defend him as having pristine character. I lost total respect for him.
Of course, trump picked him.
So Pretty much like Hillary...
Gas is 40 cents higher since he became secretary but big oil keeps making money
He’s making Oklahomans proud again. We have so little to be proud of but this turd sinks us to the bottom of the pond.
He is indeed the Dirtiest Republican of All Time.
Enough is enough. It’s time to #FirePruitt: http://on.nrdc.org/2FZyjkN 
"The sound of silence is over. It’s time we stood and called out with one voice on behalf of the American people." NRDC President, @RheaSuh #FirePruitt


Most of our politicians are, sseize all corporate lobbying and shoot down citizens united a d the tone would change 100% in Washington and locally.
Anything like Obama and all his little trips to Pakistan and claiming to be a foreign student from Kenya to get grants for school? I seem to remember something about people who live in glass houses...
This is not news.
#POS
A lifelong Grifter?  That explains why the Carnival Grifter in the WH is sticking by him!
Right up 45's alley, they probably exchange notes on how to become even better grifters....
That's why Grifter Pruitt needs the soundproof phone booth - to make secure calls to do his dirty deals and get coaching from Trump on where the next marks are. He is paranoid for a good reason - he is a crook, and under a microscope.
No wonder Trump likes him then.
Ah, yeah....grifterhood doesnt just start ...it’s a way of life!
@ScottPruittOK What a slimeball grifter and taker. A moral compass equal to @POTUS ...meaning non-existent.
@realDonaldTrump - good news is that there is someone that is more of a con man than you are.   Bad news is that you are both losers.
Again, this article is a must-read, folks. Talk about draining the swamp!
This time he's grifting off the taxpayers...
Somebody has to advise or make understand cabinet members difference between capitalism and luxuriasm
this kind of confirms/validates my distaste for most conservatives: they keep advocating for cuts but they themselves are unabashed at receiving freebies 

#conservatives #hypocrites
Calling him a grifter seems charitable. He was and is a paid henchman for corporate interests.
Corporate welfare?
Pretty sure this admin is full of grifters and charlatans
Draining the swamp and filling it with s...
What was that? I couldn’t hear you. I was in my $43,000 hermetically sealed phone booth ordering a pizza. What? You don’t have one. Ha! Peons
Is Trump Administration an Administration of Grifters?
No wonder @realDonaldTrump won’t fire him- they’re soulmates.
What a weasel.

#TrumpISTheSwamp #TrumpHiresOnlyBestGrifters #TrumpSwampsters #TrumpCrooks #PruittKochPawn
Trump has truly succeeded in "draining the swamp"...and replaced it with his cesspool! 
Trump “only hires the best people”, remember? 
Show him the door.
But 45 only hires the best and smartest people.  #TrumpCorruption #DrainTheSwamp  #PruittMustGo
Why hasn’t anyone in the MSM mentioned Tea Pot Dome as precedent for the rampant corruption in this administration?
SOUNDS LIKE A WEASEL, ALWAYS GOT FEATHERS SPITTIN 
OUT WHEN HE TALKS !
IN TH COUNTRY, CHICKIN THIEVES USALLY GET TRAPPED
& SHOT IN TH HEAD !
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec @ShepNewsTeam @wolfblitzer @morningmika @LouDobbs @SRuhle the admin of extreme vetting for refugees vets NO ONE for gov't jobs.
Shifty Pruitt, the Petty Cash Bandid! 
Coming from the NYT ends it for me
The best people no doubt. Grifters and cons, the lot of’em.
Competency, history, civics, economics, and other areas of intelligence and ethics needs to be tests for EVERYONE running for an elected or appointed positions with our government!! We need to impose standards of conduct.
Real corruption
Yep. The Grifter Bastard from Oklahoma.
According to @Osaycanyousee when you get older, you just get more of what you are. So those who expected @realDonaldTrump & Pruitt to change are deluding themselves or just rationalizing their decision.
This was a GREAT job by the @NYTimes staff. A true lesson in journalism!
His sealed e mails would be a insight into his shady past
Mob crook.
I believe it...
#vladbarzini
aka a #Republican
Hard for putin’s gang to recruit criminals who haven’t been caught yet #cleanrecords.
And he’s a Trump fave. As momma used to say, “Like attracts like.”
Pruitt isn’t The Swamp. He’s the whole Everglades.
Pruitt's a whore.
Stormy is an adult film star.
See the difference?
What a bum
His supporters have not figured out what's going on yet. This regime is all about big business and the wealthy. If we have the misfortune to need social services, and gain access to what we have paid into through the federal government, we're now being told it's an entitlement.
washington is just a larger pocket book for him.
What a surprise......but here's hoping Pruitt watched NOVA 2 hour show on climate change. Is anyone paying attention?
Grifters gotta grift. We have an administration of grifters.
The pollution / extraction / carbon industries literally bought and paid for this corrupt puppet. As Oklahoma AG he allowed them to write the rules & poison the air, water & soil of our citizens. Republicans put profits above public health & lead in our water is the result.
Republicans are the swamp
Not so good
Gee thanks #Okalahoma for giving this country yet another grifter. Please vote smarter in 2018.
Cabinet of welfare kings
It is so very refreshing to see this more honest reporting. There has been unprecedented corruption in the Trump Administration, which the media have been too genteel in reporting. Good to see proper characterization of a key player in this destructive team of thieves.
The only time the #MSM #FakeNews slander defame libel create character assassination against a person is when they’re decent honest people calling out the frauds and fakes - of the #media hate a person then that’s a sure sign they’re doing everything Right!  #ScottPruitt
Tiny titan.
Scott Pruitt is Trailer-Trash Trump.
Trump's "Best" people...
Taking America To The Cleaners
#VoteGOPOut 
Pruitt must go NOW!
No surprise...so is the guy who nominated him...drain the swamp...to put them in Cabinet
Kleptocracy attracts grifters
Get this guy out!
#swamp
Well then, he fits right in with the trump clan...
But Trump said he would only hire the best....never said best what
Something’s definitely wrong if @EPAScottPruitt doesn’t end up in prison. They should charge Pruitt’s family as well, receiving stolen property is a crime too. They’d have to be every bit as sorry as he is.
@EPAScottPruitt lifelong grifter. Also, to take it that extra step, such a blowhard he rides around in first class has a massive secure entourage and likes pretty sirens and lights on way to dinner.  Zero integrity.
So if many of us knew that, and communicated it, thank you for bringing light. Many people in NYC knew Trump as well. Rape, pillage and plunder the Treasury for personal gain at the expense of society is criminal. No excuses suffice. The Republic demands laws to work for all.
NYT's = #fakenews
Sooooo shocked. "Nobody knew!"
Arghgh
I think pretty much anyone in Oklahoma could have told you that. It's like Trump went out  and found the most smelly sewer rats and pond scum he could find for his administration, and after making certain they were corrupt, gave a giant FU to America.
Pretty remarkable for the NYT to call Pruitt a “Grifter” — and highly appropriate.  But only another of Trump’s best and brightest. Shameless!
@CONGRESS  @EPAScottPruitt  HAS A  BULLETPROOF PLAN  LIVING  OFF THE TAXPAYERS .
NOW  >FOR HOW LONG ?
Did you hear Marc Scott's defense on MTP this am? Well, yes the ethics .. but we are very happy with his policies. So it's ok to lie, cheat, steal & rob the American taxpayer as long as we also destroy the environment, social safety nets etc.?  Then Zinke and Carson are safe too
Hmmm, seems as if politics has been wonderful for Mr. Pruitt's financial bottom line...probably because there's no line he won't across to make a deal where he is the primary beneficiary.  The public good can just go to Hell for all Mr. Pruitt seems to give a damn.
#PruittMustGo
Parallels this entire shameless kakistocracy.
Dang it’ll be great to bring this grifter to justice!
SOMEONE NEEDS TO BANG THE DRUM IN THIS ONE. He is DISGUSTING
What swamp?
He certainly is. Hopefully the many current investigations will end up bringing him to justice for his federal malfeasance. The people of OK should investigate him for state crimes. #PRUITTISACROOK #PruittMustGo #FirePruittNow
THAT IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR BEING IN THE PIGPREZPOTUS CABINET..EVERY LIE A PERSON TELLS IS A COMMITMENT TO THE PIGPREZ POTUS @realDonaldTrump .  NOTHING BUT DEPLORABLE ANTI-CHRISTS IN PREZ LUCIFER'S CABINET
Long live the non-fake free press.
Well, how else is a guy going to get ahead in this state?
If NYT mines further this would be a common pattern. A bunch of grifters scaling it up after they moved closer & joined the Trump Administration complementing a mafia don.
Pruitt needs to be indicted and removed from office!
"Grifter" is pretty strong language but, in this case, the label seems to fit.
@PhilipRucker Happy to be your 4000 retweet on this one. I can't wait until this swamp monster is gone!

These are totally worthless people stealing from our government and the people
Sleaze excellence
IOW, @EPAScottPruitt was a racketeer and grifter back in Oklahoma long before he ever made it to the EPA. This is evidently his standard modus operandi. He kisses industry's (and their lobbyist's) asses, they pay him nicely for it.
Drain the Swap.
When will @realDonaldTrump realize that Pruitt needs to go?
Actually Trump already knows Pruitt should go but Pruitt is doing all Trump has mandated he do. Congress needs to intervene.
What is.... reasons why @ScottPruittOK was picked by @realDonaldTrump for his administration, Alex? #Trump #ScottPruitt #PruittMustGo
Scott Pruitt is a deadbeat. Tar & feather him.
Any comment @EPAScottPruitt
What kind of system have we created, when 'bribery' has been sanitized and repackaged as "lobbyist largess"?
#SnowflakeScott is the best @realDonaldTrump could hire 
Another Taker.
Perfect
"Grifter" perfect description.
Well, surprise, surprise.
45 who lives the Grifting Life loves him some Scott Pruitt grifting - it's not the policy (cuz Trump doesn't know from policy), it's the grift that keeps Pruitt in place.  For Pruitt, the destruciton of natural resources is just a sweet cherry on top of the lobbyist bribes.
A la Donald Trump.
FIRE pruitt
It's a shame, They're All Grifters!  And why  are Grifters ruining America!? Because people have been conned, into believing that people on the top of the food chain, blamed people at the bottom, were taking thier jobs from them, Not Automation.
Another con, just like his boss.
One of the reasons Trump liked him. Swamp like him!!!
He's a crook.
No wonder Trump likes him: 2 peas in a pod.

once a grifter, always a grifter ... eh @EPAScottPruitt ?
As the @GOP remains silent in their complicity. 

The entire @HouseRepubiclan and @NRSC block needs to be voted out. 

America has had enough, Trump was bad enough, they embraced the grifter family and cabinet
No wonder @realDonaldTrump loves @ScottPruittOK. Birds of a feather.....
And Courpt EPA Secretary!
You mean ‘slithering’ to Washington, right?
Of course he is a grifter--hence perfect for this White House.
RESIGN.PRUITT.RESIGN.
Thief. Period.
The question is, can we get rid of him?
This “take all you can take any way you can take it” attitude seems to be the mantra of Trump and everyone around him. #DenofThieves
Yet he was Senate confirmed - days a lot about their own values.  And Senate still sits there like it's ok
Always thought he was a total bastard, know there's proof!!!
@realDonaldTrump how’s draining the swamp going? @EPAScottPruitt must go!
Shocker.
Exactly why his boss loves him to pieces.
How did I know?
Petroleum Prince Pruitt
All grifters, OUT
The whole Administration is Riddled with Grifters
Probably the most corrupt man in Washington in history and that includes Trump.
Good god what crooks
Love it. The Brokie Okie
Swamp.
And yet...
Pruitt is a career-long swamp creature after Trump's own "heart". He's emblematic of the rot in the Republican party that pre-dates Trump.
If you were to write a screenplay about a worthless man who spent his life grifting, who eventually found himself in a position to wreck an institution he hated, with tragic consequences, it would sound a lot like the career of Scott the pirate Pruitt.
Great article, stomach turning, too
This is a tweet I’m particularly proud to RT on #EarthDay . In another year let’s hope he’ll be paying back every penny he stole from the funds allocated for our country’s environmental stewardship & wasted on his own luxury.
Practically EVERY SINGLE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL lives off lobbyists....you're just pointing fingers at the ones you dislike. Typical liberal tactics.
The portrait of the @realDonaldTrump swamp
 look at my shocked face
Pruitt: I pledge allegiance to the money for which it stands, making me rich, making me richer and living off the taxpayer teat!
Exactly trump's idea of the "Best People" grifters just like himself
Only the best people
Pruitts a crook; anyone in OK already knew that
He's a crook
@ScottPruittOK @realDonaldTrump Time for Pruitt to go but Dems privately want him to stay #MidTerms
Said Phillip Rucker, who killed negative stories on Harvey Weinstein to get his script "Jackie" produced as a movie and went on fishing trips paid by FusionGPS in exchange for writing smear stories on WH/NSA whistleblower Diane Roark
A great Trumpolyte
Water (swamp) seeks it's own level.
It's no wonder #45 likes this #crook
Look closer.  It's been most Okla' politicians, for years!
Leave him the hell alone.
Trump has to hire compromised people so he can control them and they will do his bidding.
This criminal posing as the EPA chief needs to be fired and forced to repay US taxpayers the money he used for his own paranoid and egotistical means.
Now there’s a nickname- Grifter Pruitt
Everything about him makes me cringe.
The Republican cream really rises to the top,  amirite?
His bio  I grift for Jesus. 
#CorruptWhackadoo
 Wow!
