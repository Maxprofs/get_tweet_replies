Are you a "journalist" or a "commentator"??

I don't see you "reporting" anything lately...but I sure do know your Opinions about news stories.

Like how we all know your Opinion is that Chelsea Clinton is a liar.
Losing credibility..don't ever say you're a reporter again.
What happens when Anthony Kennedy retires ?  Maybe we should impeach Trump NOW ?
Damnit! Because of your Chelsea Clinton tweet, I now look at everything from you with a different eye. Til now, I trusted your word without question.
If passed, I hope there is a provision in the travel ban that protects us from American white males with AR 15s. Aurora,Parkland,Las Vegas,
Sandy Hook,Umpqua CC
Waffle House,Texas Church et al.
Of course they do.
Naturally!
EVERYONE should watch: Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution', a 2005 BBC 6 part series now playing on Netflix! RIGHT NOW and every time the word, “Jew” is said, hear, “Muslim” instead! 
I thought the ban originally was temporary until procedures could be put into place to increase the vetting process. Shouldn't those plans be in place? It's been over a year.
This has been going on for over a year. A decision is finally at hand, but it’s doubtful that it will stop activist judges
Of course.
Surprised you can write anything .Your hands must be shaking in compete anger.I bet you are crying just like everyone on CNN and MSNBC was in Nov. of 2016.
Goodbye first amendment.
Not surprised. Key word: Conservative. In Trump's America Conservative = punitive, in compassionate, tribal.


The lawyers asked the court to ignore what he says abd his tweets. Ridiculous.
Merrick Garland! Nuff said.
