This. This is why I want to scream every single day!!!!!!!!
Seek professional help.
@sp1r1tharamble and you need to leave the country. You’re not welcome here anymore.
You are talking to a 8yr Marine Corps vet... just an FYI Carla.
I don’t care. Bye!!!!!!!
How can your support a draft dodger like tRump is beyond me. You are a disgrace to the country you served.
You need to seek help. You are mentally ill.
That all you have? Bring it cause I can take you.
This man is not smart enough to spell EPA.
How is he not in jail yet?
LOL at the left protesting transparency.
We're going to have a big mess to clean up once we have destroyed the GOP in the #BlueTsunami2018.  Pruitt must go ASAP.
This is just as inept & corrupt as he is in this inept, unqualified & corrupt administration.
Pruitt’s transparency = 
Oxy-MORON of the Day!
#ScottPruittIsDirty
if its science based then its limited to not being used.  Heresay, conjecture, and old wives tales is how the epa will make policy rules
Swamp building
How the actual hell does this happen?!
This is insane and should be stopped.
That guy is Swamp Monster #1
@EPAScottPruitt is one of the most dishonest, dangerous men in America.
The anti-science EPA, at the bidding of the fossil fuel donors, is attempting to erase the real cause of climate change. This is dangerous for democracy. Climate change is fact. The  and humankind will pay a big price for the ignorance and depavity of leadership based on lies.
Why is he still in this administration?  This man is the worse offender and abuser of tax payer money.  Not to mention the worse possible person to run the EPA. #BlueWaveComing2018 will be the only way to get our country back
Because this administration is just like him.
It seems like every day I learn something that makes me hate that POS Pruitt even more.
He's doing Donald's work - destroy the EPA so his friends can make more money.
Is this man certifiable?
But no transparency on how he spends our money?
U can bet if the Admin was Democrat and they had someone like Pruitt doing this crap there would be Congressional hearings up the wazoo. But no. @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr, and the GOP are content to let this swamp monster run wild. #RememberInNovember
Science please.
What sad days for such an important agency.
Pruitt: Uniquely unqualified to hold public office.  Resign or face impeachment.
Please God. Make him go away
What the fuck is it going to take people?
Yes. We can see right through him.
What kind? Only research from companies that give him money?
What a shame for all of us. Spanky and his gang are not good for our Country or the World
Hasn’t he done enough damage?
The Ignorant Plan
In a nod to transparency,,,,I pray his Future Warden limits the research into what his Cell Mates will do to him 

Lord Forgive me
Thought police.
He’s the expert of transparency I guess.
Orwell was only off by 34 years
Lock. Him. Up.
How. Does. This. Man. Still. Have. A. Job?
>“There are ways to improve transparency in the decision-making process, but restricting the use of science would improve neither transparency nor the quality of EPA decision-making,”

I think I'll listen to a 1,000 scientists over a hack that requires $50,000 soundproof booth.
Haven’t we had enough?
Bye-byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee....
Mind and thought control by a tiny old white man who has led his life in the shadows. No truth or light in his life.
#FirePruitt
I can’t believe he’s 49 I thought he was 10 years older at least.
Everything is Ok.......
??? Katy, Can you re-phrase this ?
Pruitt is very transparent like the sleaze bag he actually is..
Transparency? Sure, that's what he wants. Yet, there's this: Last year, Pruitt barred any scientists from serving if they received EPA grants for their work. Researchers funded by industries regulated by the agency to continue serving.
Really at this point why bother calling it the EPA it’s really the BPA (Business Protection Agency) screw the environment as long as we protect profits. Agency led by climate change deniers should keep its name
But as long as we have free press, We The People can have truth

God help us....  Not sure I can take this for 3 more years.
Why isn't this guy in jail yet?
See entire Trump cabinet, kids, son-in-law, Cohen, Hannity, Russians living in Trump Tower for answers.

Only the best and brightest minds.......... Dear Lord help us for we are stupid and do not vote !
When does he go in front of Congress? Pruitt having to answer for corruption in open hearing? May not look good for the administration for him having to answer for Bulletproof seat coverings. It better be televised.
Screw it, Pruitt can handle the VA, too.
Hahaha...transparency?  Pruitt?  Please!  Well maybe his cone of silence qualifies.
With Opaque spending sprees

"Transparency"=censorship? 
Not Orwellian at all.
He is a cartoon character of the MOST evil villain! Except that he's real.
Translation: Pruitt unleashes another barrage in his war on science because he's a corrupt AF lap dog for fossil fuel companies.
And that, is why he’s still there.
