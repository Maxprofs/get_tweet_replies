So did you write a book to make money? Just curious, b/c your entire network has went after @Comey for writing a book and making money
I love the utter silence when ppl get called out on there BS! I’m referring to Katy since she’s now wrote a second book regarding trump in an effort to profit! The hypocrisy of @MSNBC and there staff trashing others for writing books to profit!
They had their own internal polling.
He didn't. All bluster & b.s. trump didn't even believe he'd win. After he won, initially he and his family looked freaked out & like they were attending a funeral. That's why trump recently said he wished he was his dr, (jealous being able to walk away from the VA cabinet post).
What goes around comes around
Darn it!  I just started the book on an overnight flight Wednesday and now you’ve ruined the ending for me!  #Heartless #Spoiler
None of us are dumb enough to have ted it
In your face, lefties.
Comedy gold!
