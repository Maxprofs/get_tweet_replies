Can we get back to the part where you called @ChelseaClinton a liar?
Still waiting for an apology to Chelsea Clinton from you and to the public for spreading lies about her.  We're waiting...
Oh, taking a break from attacking Chelsea Clinton?
Dems look awfully silly celebrating a loss
After Hillary’s upset - they’re craving any type of win - even in a loss. Party is in bad shape.
after you got your money now your pretending to hold him accountable.!!
you guys knew all this before you put him into power..
The good doctor's good showing proves that there are a few rational people left in Arizona. It's frightening that they have become an endangered species.
I get that the Dems are closing the gap, but a loss is still a loss. Losing by less may be a moral victory, but it won't put the grownups in charge this fall.
they want a fight i say lets give them one.! @SenWarren
responsible observer!! did somebody say my name?
A sick game of victimization!
Republicans set up the system for black/brown to fail. Then when they fail> republicans are the first to point the finger  & say these lazy people are begging for help..! help yourself..! yet they set up the system to make sure people of color fail..
The November midterms are closer than you think.  Work HARD !

Keep campaigning and run against her in November.

I imagine it's pretty much the result of a lot of participation trophies being given out in the 80s and 90s.  I assume that's why whenever you see someone literally fall on their ass, they get up with their hands in the air looking for applause.
that’s cute...
Another 15% plus swing away from Trump!
