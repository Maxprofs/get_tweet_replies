Remember when you banged Keith olbermann? Lol
What does her sex life have to do with anything ahe is referencing. Is this ur way of trying to belittle a woman? Your comment is as unnessecary as u following her. Find better things to do with your free time.
I don't understand this, Katie. The link goes to a page asking 4 subscriptions but your headline says they are going blank. Can you explain this? I want to subscribe but now I'm concerned.
The whole point of going blank is to raise awareness that they need subscriptions otherwise theyâ€™ll have to close.
The sad reality when newspapers don't innovate with the times.
Ffs let us subscribe at $7.99 per month instead of trying to bill us a year upfront.  ARE YOU LISTENING SUN TIMES?
Pity it's not the NYT or Wapo.
sad
I get a sunday sub, and it took 5 weeks for them to actually deliver it,WTF.  Still, this is the ONLY place to get local political or state political news of substance for this city.  The tribune is a barren rag, not even liberal for the city w only dem mayors dating back to 1927
This is the only real newspaper in town, circulation within city limits has been better than tribune for 40 years.
The plot of Early Edition would become dire.
Happening in Denver too. The post is the only paper left and it too is looking grim and trying a paywall.
I still have my newspapers delivered. Chicago Sun-Times and the @chicagotribune . I know I'm old fashioned that way.
Let #FakeNews sink
Just subscribed
This is just pathetic attempt for subscription ...dems are being fooled ..

Hope that Washington Post also shuts down ...
