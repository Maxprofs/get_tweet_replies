@KatyTurNBC Just saw you on @ABCTV and a) I'm heading out to buy your book NOW. b)You are an awesome kickarse, smart as hell woman.
Nope. You called Chelsea a liar and I am waiting for you to apologize to her

MICHELLE WOLF: I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you...he has helped you sell your papers & your books & your TV. You helped create this monster and now you’re profiting…
Cannot wait for @QandA tonight. I watch MSNBC religiously. @KatyTurNBC , @morningmika , @HallieJackson , @kasie to name a few are brilliant women. I think @Morning_Joe should venture down under for a week!
If all you are going to talk about is Wolf & Sanders...NO!
