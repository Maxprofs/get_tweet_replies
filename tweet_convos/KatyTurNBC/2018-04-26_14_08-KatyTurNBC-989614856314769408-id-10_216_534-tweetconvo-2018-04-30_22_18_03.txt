FBI releases letter that does not give much credence to the White House version of events on Rob Porter. https://democrats-oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/FBI.041318.Response%20to%20Gowdy%20re%20Clearances%20%26%20Porter.pdf â€¦
Porter seems like a decade ago.
It shouldn't be.  We cannot forget the absolute disgrace of this Admin and the mockery it is making of our country.
It seems they have some sort of disconnect in their overall vetting process. 
But "everybody liked him", staffers were shocked when the allegations came to light.  The same  kind of reaction to Ronny Jackson happened yesterday, nice guy, etc.  Even nice people have secrets and skeletons that don't often see the light of day.
Porter is a single man who beat the last wiman he was in. Then he goes to WH to work amongst women, including Hope Hicks. None of these women knew Porter might beat them, should any have decided to hook up w/him.
Wait, what, the White House lied?
Not surprised at all..

Is that supposed to be a surprise??
