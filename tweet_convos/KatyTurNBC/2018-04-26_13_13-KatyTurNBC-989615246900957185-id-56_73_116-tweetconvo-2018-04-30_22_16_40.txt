Well they do have something in common..... Big bellies.
Both weighing in at 239 lbs

The Far Eastern White House?
#fakephoto
Well then you need to go to the official Whitehouse page and tell them to stop sharing fake photos cause that is exactly where it came from. Are you trumpers so uninformed about life that all you can say is fake. https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse 
They have a major guilt complexes over helping Putin put him in office
Amazing! They found someone with smaller hands and a bigger paunch.

One has to admit Kim Jong-un has played his cards beautifully. On the other hand Trump played his hand...............................
