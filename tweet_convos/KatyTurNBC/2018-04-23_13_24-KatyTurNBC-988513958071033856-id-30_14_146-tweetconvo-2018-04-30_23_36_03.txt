COMING UP: @KatyTurNBC hosts #MTPDaily live at 5pmET on @MSNBC
I’m there daily — when away from the TV I DVR.
I love Stephanie myself. #FABULOUS
I watch Stephanie too. She is delightful. Hell I keep MSNBC all day. My sons visit and joke “you looking at impeach trump .” I say yes 
Tater tots included?
.Katy-Can You Investigate Why The WH Press Corps Usually Gives Such Weak Follow Up Questions? If a question is not answered, the next press person called should repeat the same question. HuckabeeSanders receives too much deference. #VelshiRuhle  @AliVelshi @AriMelber
You’re pretty awesome!
OK
First Republican you let spew BS, I'll be changing the channel.
Whomp, there it is.
Yay!!!
Will there be tots?
Maybe if this administration nominated better candidates they could been confirmed sooner.
Hope Chuck is back tomorrow
A good show!
Go Katy!
On Every important vote Rand Paul says he is a No and changes to a Yes every time! Why you guys keep giving him coverage? You are asking why did he change his mind? It’s annoying!
@RandPaul has always been a Putin puppet. He is there to create chaos. #Montenegro
His actions are always proRussia.
Never watch MSNBC like to get my news from real journalists not DNC operatives and lyin'

Sorry, going to see SuperTroopers 2.
I will!
I only watch MTP when you host. I can’t stand Chuck Todd. He’s a channel changer for me.

No thanks.

Waiting patiently @KatyTurNBC. Waiting patiently.
Leave your field to flower...
