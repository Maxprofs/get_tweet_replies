Back from Vegas. Caught a bad cold. So now I’m on bed rest, reading about @KatyTurNBC’s adventure covering the Trump campaign. Can’t put it down! Such a great and fun read. 
Sorry I missed this .. what did MSNBC tell all of you to "back off of" Katy?  I thought you wrote your own stuff and no narratives are being pushed at MSNBC?
@BrandonLopezTV tater tots help heal quicker.
The true test of an author with a message. It's important for an author of consequence be intellectually honest, self-aware, realistic, generally aware of world events, responsible and communicable. Not so much with sick or infectious writers. Harsh or negative verbiage harms.
I read your book on my trip to grandkids in CA. Loved it. Gave it to my 90 year old mother to read when I got back. She was a bit upset about the language but loves you Katy lol
Listen to it on audio read by author. Much better.
The book was great.
It sure is a great read!!
I second that. Unbelievable is a great read, and the title is just right - not overselling as I expected
The shelf life of Unbelievable is perhaps even unbelievable to K Tur:)
