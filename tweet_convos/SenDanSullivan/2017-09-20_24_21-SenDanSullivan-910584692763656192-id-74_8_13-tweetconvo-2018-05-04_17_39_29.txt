reminder: the sole reason your office line doesn't ring is because you having a spine would be more shocking than my dog fighting in the UFC
that said he would be pretty good tbh i mean look what he did to the pumpkin scarecrow
Disappointed that you would even consider voting yes on this bill.
How about talking to your constituents? Or perhaps LISTENING to us when we say we don't want this horrible bill that will hurt millions?
We're yelling at him, in every form we have, he is just a coward, a shill, and a hack.  We'll just have to remove him from office.
I'm certainly voting him out.  He cares more for his GOP buddies than Alaskans
Same. I don't even bother contacting his office because I know he's just going to kiss party ass, not actually consider us.
Call (202)224-3004 and tell him to vote no.   Make that phone keep ringing.
OK. I will.
Thank you.
Done : )
Please for once look at the big picture and vote no.  Work with ALL Senators and do what's right. Listen to McCain
If you vote to pass GrahamCassidy it means that you do not GAF about your state or constituents.
Truth words, don't worry, he'll vote for it if it comes up, no matter what it says or does, or who it dooms.
How about going on Team #TalkofAlaska @aprn, Senator? Right from the comfort of your office, to boot. Alaskans are waiting to call.
Americans deserve solid bipartisan healthcare, not bad bills rammed through to meet deadlines.  Please do what's right: Vote NO on GraCas!
#noGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyKills
Alaska would lose $1 billion under Graham-Cassidy. Don't lie to voters.
Please vote no on this. America needs you
PLEASE don't sell your soul or sell out your constituents' health. You have to KNOW it's BAD.
Oh he knows, he just doesn't care.  "I'm looking at the details" is bullshit, everyone knows it's a bad bill, they just wanna cut taxes.
It's about perpetually applied pressure
ORG AGAINST This Bill!  AMA, AARP,  Cancer Society, Cancer Action Network,  Diabetes Assoc, Heart Assoc,  Lung Assoc, March of Dimes

This can't be repeated enough:

#GrahamCassidy will allow for lifetime spending caps a NICU baby can reach before ever leaving the hospital.
@SenDanSullivan, wanna pay for my depression/anxiety meds & birth control once AK is allowed to let insurers run their rates sky high?
The State of AK Dept. of Health already looked more closely and it's terrible for Alaska VOTE NO on #GrahamCassidy

You better get rid of Obama care or We are going to get rid of you
Please pass it! Please! No more Obamacare
Don't lie to us.  I will lose my care as will millions of others. My death and my families is on your conscience. Remember my name.
I consider a yes from you as a personal attack on my disabled son. Don't make him choose between poverty and pain, Senator.
Yep. The boss weighs your health vs his profit. Just like in slavery.  Of course, if you want to be free, sign here:
So what's your opinion on the new addition to the bill that would keep Obamacare in place in your state? Surely you'll vote no.
You reek of lies and hedging. You want to vote for the bill cuz Mitch told you to, period. This bill is TERRIBLE for Alaska, and you know it
Any time the government gets involved with anything the cost goes up big time.
Can a hospital room really cost over 5000 a day?an aspirin $25.00. How did this happen. Health care insurance! Repeal only
All I see being built in the valley and anchorage are medical facilities. Why is that? Gravy train!
Repeal and do not replace. Ins is the  problem. This is socialism commie crap. Please remember your oath. Lisa is a lose, don't be one!
Vote no if Graham-Cassidy comes to a vote
Please reject the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Healthcare money to the states is a smokescreen for cutting coverage.
JUST OUT: Here's a summary of the Graham-Cassidy repeal. Yes, it's that bad.

Spread far and wide if useful. 
AK healthcare sys failing under ACA...in favor of canx ACA that doesn't work/bring back more HC insurers to state.
YOU could have expanded Medicaid like the states that get more federal dollars. This is how you get more money w/o giving more #healthcare
God I can't wait to campaign against you.  At this point I would endorse @notarealchris 's dog over you. You are awful go back to Ohio.
Allowing one state to choose to exclude preexisting conditions allows for a second and a third and soon it's a death spiral.
Can we send the funeral bills for all the people you are going to kill if this passes? Asking for a few million friends.
This bill would decimate Alaska.
Do you really think sending back to states "protects" people? You are creating no states with insurance. Win? Not what you were elected for.
Don't sell out the vulnerable on healthcare. America takes care of all of its citizens!
Lemme guess, you're going to be the obedient little senator an vote for it because they're said so. Some Marine you turned out to be.
America may be made up of states but health care is needed by all citizens. Makes no sense to divide coverage. We need it wherever we live.
Dan, how would this affect ppl like in Anchorage where it's income is highest and high grocery and housing/ rent prices??
I don't trust you one bit. You don't care about us, you care abt campaign money from donors who don't care about AK at all either. NO! 99507
a dad's plea for healthcare... have you no conscience Dan#NoRepeal
Watch this Dad say what every other American is feeling. Stop trying to take our healthcare away & start helping us! 
so you've pretty much sold your soul to several GOP devils #shameful

Amazing quote from @ChuckGrassley here: Despite many reasons to oppose Graham-Cassidy, GOP must support it to uphold campaign promises. 
This is KEY. Centerpiece of new GOP strategy is to nakedly shift huge amounts of money from Dem states to GOP states to buy way to 50 votes.
you look sweaty because you know you are lying to America.  Here's an idea, tell the truth and Alaskans will support you instead of Koch?
You will send millions to the ER. How does that save money?
Premara premiums are down 26% in AK, you can't justify supporting this bill. But I know that Koch Money is so sweet.

JUST OUT: Under Graham Cassidy ACA repeal...

-a 31% cut to Medicaid for kids
-a 15% cut for ppl w/ disabilities…
But no sweat bc @SenDanSullivan & @lisamurkowski are taking bribes from graham Cassidy & McConnell
BREAKING: In the last hour, Chris Christie, AHIP (Insurers), Blue Cross, Fed of Amer Hospitals announced Graham-Cassidy opposition.
Focus now is @lisamurkowski's vote.She says it will be about the "numbers."

Here they are: $11B loss for Alaska.

NEW: Graham Cassidy repeal: A series of independent non-partisan analyses have just been released.

Here it is in one place: 
http://www.businessinsider.com/graham-cassidy-health-care-bill-alaska-purchase-lisa-murkowski-vote-2017-9 … Graham Cassidy is buying votes
Graham-Cassidy boiled down:1-punish states for expanding Medicaid, 2-reward states that didn't, 3-In 10 years kill Medicaid & all subsidies
again you probably want to tell your intern to stop posting fox news. It is an embarrassment to your intellect and integrity.
Are you aware its passage would harm Alaskans? My guess is that as a carpetbagger, you don't care. Don't care who you're married to!
Have you considered what Alaskans wants instead of what your donors want? We're going to lose 11Billion. Listen to AK. Vote not you tool
Are you ignorant or malicious?
14/ Also the GOP argument on giving flexibility to states was undercut by GOP not giving flexibility to states.

Why don't you care about kids?? #GrahamCassidy
Avalere, a consulting firm, modeled Graham-Cassidy's cap on Medicaid over time. Look what it does to children and the disabled. SAVAGE. 
Our state is floundering with money woes. Can you guarantee federal monies that land in AK will actually go to AK health care? Can you?

Sen @BillCassidy called our reading of his health care bill on pre-existing conditions false. Here’s how we read it: http://n.pr/2fAWevD  https://twitter.com/BillCassidy/status/910316563047337984 …
Why do you lie? #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #NOGrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidy #SaveOurCare
Oh, #WeReadIt. Section 106 allows states to waive underwriting req's. Insurers could charge through the roof for preexisting conditions.
