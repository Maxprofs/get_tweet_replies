@SenDanSullivan How are you feeling proud about the 2nd amendment when PEOPLE ARE DYING EVERY DAY and you are in the position to CHANGE it?
@BrianJWaz @SenDanSullivan Eye for an eye, right?  And we call ourselves a civilized and evolved society.  Go figure.
@BrianJWaz @SenDanSullivan shoot each other to "have had a chance"?
@BrianJWaz @SenDanSullivan Numbers don't lie. Other countries ban guns. PERIOD.
@SenDanSullivan Senator, Now is the time for you to do your job and STOP future gun violence.
@debroby @SenDanSullivan  arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@holymusic55 , pass. Don't need to arm my family. My neighbors, and my society is strong. Guns will do nothing. @SenDanSullivan
@debroby @SenDanSullivan so said dead victims in gun free zones. If only someone had a gun at #SanBernadino they were strong too. #FightBack
@SenDanSullivan you take blood money from NRA to block laws that would protect US civilians. You were hired to protect US not terrorists.
@naithom @sherrilee7 @SenDanSullivan 

Vote him out.
@Rockmedia @naithom @sherrilee7 @SenDanSullivan "vote him out" in Alaska??? Everybody has an arsenal up here. Including old ladies. #GetAGun
@holymusic55 @naithom @sherrilee7 @SenDanSullivan
@Rockmedia @naithom @sherrilee7 @SenDanSullivan don't be a victim #GetAGun protect yourself the world is dangerous
@holymusic55 @naithom @sherrilee7 @SenDanSullivan 
Do you realize most people who are killed by guns, accidentally 2nd amendment themselves.
@IlladelphAC @SenDanSullivan arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@SenDanSullivan is bought and paid for by the NRA to do nothing. #thoughtsandprayers
@SenDanSullivan Your prayers are hollow. Stop promoting the right to buy assault weapons. Their blood is on your hands.
@SenDanSullivan how about you take those thoughts and put them into a comprehensive gun control bill.
@joyengel @SenDanSullivan arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@SenDanSullivan I #blameyou & I #blamethenra
Blood is on your hands! 
@SenDanSullivan
Your #thoughtsandprayers aren't getting it. How about some gun legislation
#gunsense
@skookerG @SenDanSullivan @mortgageconsult i agree
@SenDanSullivan  stop praying and do something
@AmeGal @SenDanSullivan arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@SenDanSullivan your feigned empathy is rote and tired. People want sensible gun laws. I have nothing left to ask but PLEASE
@SenDanSullivan Pray for forgiveness for standing in the way of those who want to make it harder for evil people to murder en masse.
@mataliandy @SenDanSullivan arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@SenDanSullivan How about working for rational gun control legislation instead?
@SenDanSullivan how about working on a bill call it the Mass shooting protection act
@SenDanSullivan Prayers are wonderful but clearly something needs to be done, not later but NOW. Enough!
@SenDanSullivan In addition to praying, you could stop taking money from #NRA and fight for commonsense legislation to protect all of us.
@BeingPoetry @SenDanSullivan arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@SenDanSullivan Your prayers mean nothing. Your actions say everything. #accomplice
@aduignancabrera @SenDanSullivan arm, train and protect ur family. It's going to get worse b/4 it gets better #ISIS  #jihad  #WWIII
@SenDanSullivan Too bad you can't do anything to stop this from happening OH WAIT THAT'S YOUR WHOLE JOB. WHAT ARE YOU PAYING YOU TO DO?!
@SenDanSullivan Well someone has to do more than think and pray.
@SenDanSullivan thoughts and prayers don't change anything. Expect massive calls to your office tomorrow
@SenDanSullivan 
Only prayer to stop more mass shootings is to give you & other US politicians courage to impose stricter gun laws.
@SenDanSullivan  you and your wretches take campaign finances from the @nra you WANT this, more death and fear.
@SenDanSullivan actions speak louder than words, do something about gun violence  you NRA hack
@SenDanSullivan Your prayers are worthless. They didn't work for the last shooting, they won't prevent the next. #NRAPuppets
@SenDanSullivan stop taking money from the #NRA starting making laws to save our children from violence.
@SenDanSullivan why don't you champion common sense gun laws? No civilian needs an assault gun
@SenDanSullivan #gunhumper
@SenDanSullivan @randyprine your praying us to death...enough already...start legislating and doing your job....pray in church....
@SenDanSullivan Instead of praying do something useful. Stand up to NRA for the victims of these crimes.
.@SenDanSullivan
@SenDanSullivan Maybe you should stop praying and actually do something worthwhile?
@SenDanSullivan the gun lobby paid you millions in the last election cycle, and they only have this simpering little missive as thanks?
@SenDanSullivan #thoughtsandprayers are not enough. #faithwithoutworks is dead.
@SenDanSullivan have the courage of your convictions you callow, frightened hypocritical child.
@SenDanSullivan Praying for more @NRA money?
@SenDanSullivan their blood is on your hands
@SenDanSullivan Here is an idea: make gun manufacturers financial responsible for these murders. Stop accepting blood money from the NRA.
@SenDanSullivan If prayer is the best you can do, how about you pray for votes instead of campaigning for reelection.
@SenDanSullivan We are tired of coward, bought and paid for politicians. We are not safe anywhere in our communities.
@SenDanSullivan We don't want empty prayers. We demand ACTIONS to stop this terror in our communities. Even GOD is tired of your platitudes,
@SenDanSullivan Please, stop. Stop praying.
@SenDanSullivan Yeah, too bad there are no courageous senators working 2 protect the community.
@SenDanSullivan your child self would punch you for following your dreams and then doing NOTHING when people need it
@SenDanSullivan
@SenDanSullivan proud member of the GOP/NRA death cult
.@SenDanSullivan Prayer without works is dead. What are your concrete plans to protect Americans from #GunViolence? #SanBernardino
@SenDanSullivan Enough with the thoughts and prayers. Do your job.
@SenDanSullivan prayers don't help, pass a damn bill
@SenDanSullivan prayers don't work, actions are needed. Actions to stop the gun violence that is tearing America apart.
@SenDanSullivan And keep selling military assault weapons, right you hypocrite?
@SenDanSullivan You can #prayforsanbernadino all you want, I want my government to #legislatefortheliving.
@SenDanSullivan Touted strong "2nd Amendment" record during election campaign
@SenDanSullivan do something. You should be shamed for connecting withNRA
@SenDanSullivan how much did the NRA give you to pray.
@SenDanSullivan NRA pays you to pray. WE THE PEOPLE PAY YOU TO FUCKING DO SOMETHING.
@SenDanSullivan prayer ain't cutting it, Senator. You need to act
@SenDanSullivan As an atheist your "praying" says to me "doing absolutely nothing." #RepealThe2ndAmendment
.@SenDanSullivan How many more dead Americans will it take for you to change your ways. 352 mass shootings in 11 months, not enough?
@SenDanSullivan Your thoughts and prayers are an excuse for inaction. Reject the NRA. Grow a spine. Fix this!
@SenDanSullivan Shame on you.  You have blood on your hands.
@SenDanSullivan STFU. Actions, not prayers help reduce gun violence.
@SenDanSullivan Praying is not a substitute for legislation. Do your job.
@SenDanSullivan ok you've prayed? What's next?
@SenDanSullivan There are two despicable things in that tweet
@SenDanSullivan Your prayers are as valuable as a used McDonald's napkin. Another Republican yutz from Alaska.
@SenDanSullivan You are truly a pathetic disgrace to our country.
@SenDanSullivan how about you actually do something quit talking!
@SenDanSullivan Then work to fix the problem.
@SenDanSullivan So when will back background checks?
@SenDanSullivan If prayer worked youâ€™d be a sewage inspector. #GunSense
@SenDanSullivan And I suppose God told you to keep doing nothing? How about changing the laws?
@SenDanSullivan we need much more than prayers, we need ACTION!!!
@SenDanSullivan DO SOMETHING YOU NRA WHORE. You've all got blood on your hands. Enough.
@SenDanSullivan I noticed you didn't send out similar thoughts & prayers here to those killed by the #PlannedParenthood terrorist on Friday.
@SenDanSullivan stand up to the NRA and help protect your people
@SenDanSullivan translation I tint care but I have to say something.
@SenDanSullivan fuck off, coward.
@SenDanSullivan Prayer is meaningless without action.
@SenDanSullivan  Stop praying and do something!
@SenDanSullivan  "faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead." James 2:17 NIV #gunsense #sanbernardinoshooting
.@SenDanSullivan You know what these families, the hundreds of families across our country, need more than your prayers?  Policy change!
.@SenDanSullivan How those prayers working out for you?
How about try what rest of civilized world has - #gunsense.
Praying for victims of despicable attack in San Bernardino & for law enforcement professionals courageously working 2 protect the community.
@inklake @komunik8 @SenDanSullivan Politicians are elected to LEGISLATE not PRAY
#SanBernadino #SanBernadinoShooting #California
@SenDanSullivan Praying is the least you can do. Really, it's the least. There is more to do. Step up and DO IT!
@SenDanSullivan Actions speak louder than thoughts and prayers. What are you doing about this mass shooting?
@SenDanSullivan praying for despicable Senators who act like there is nothing they can do! Wake up and smell the gun residue! #nraowned
@SenDanSullivan Just start praying for events like this not to happen... Problem solved man.
