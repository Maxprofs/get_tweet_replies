Gratitude and felicitations. You have proved once again beyond doubt that if you want to achieve, nothing can stop you.
It was achieved in Tamil Nadu 30 years ago. Not just electricity but also bus link to every single village every single day - no matter how remote those villages are. It goes to show how under developed are places like Gujarat and Bihar.
They waited long

Thank you sir . यह आपका ही देन है जिसके कारण आज हमारे गांव मे approx 20hr बिजली रहती है।
A major & laudable achievement! Something unimaginable prior too 2014! 
Modi ji Aapke yahi dedication, honesty se to Rahul ki nind udi hui hai...love you Modi ji..we all are  with you..
Great actor u r modiji
This is right information..??? Pahle bhi kitne bar shun chuka hu 
I am sorry to say sir
This is not the correct information what is in circulation by government, still many villages are waiting for electrification work...  I am also a resident of a village where electrification not done and on my several request I'm being asked to wait.
Electrification of village is not same as electrification of your house. Understand that bro.
Have you visited to my village 
Have you seen any electric pole there in my village and if seen have checked out the wire by touching your about electricy supply...  No need to educate me but to get the electricity to my home it should be in my village /town
HDFC Bank branch kya solar energy par chal rahi hai kya? 

Power House Road naam sirf dikhane ke liya hai kya?
सिराथू पहुंचकर फोन करो गांव की सैर कराते है सिराथू तहसील है

Love u sir !! Keep doing the good job.
Good.Hope 24 hrs supply of electricity in villages with no power cut  and power theft
Ensure that it will be 24×7

MODI THE KILLER
@narendramodi  Love to hear such a wonderful achievement after more than 50 years of Independence. There is no meaning by supplying electricity to every village unless until 24hrs power supply available in http://villages.You  can check the status of Jaleswar(756032).
Congratulations Modi sir!!

Be carefull always before see.
Thanks PM sir to upkeep promise and this will certainly change the lives of millions and particularly to the young buddies who were finding difficult to prepare for exams.
Now it’s time to give your attention to change our rot based Macaulay education system.
That’s not access to free fair and fast justice, and nations don’t run on electricity Dr Dang!

जब अच्छा ड्राइवर चुन हीं लिया है !

तो खतरनाक मोड़ पर चिल्लाने और धमकाने की बजाए उस पर भरोसा रखें उसे धैर्य से अपना काम करने दें !

मंजिल तक गाड़ी जरूर पहुंच जाएगी !

Sorry Sir to say this, we have been staying since more than 80 years in the same village but still we don't have any facilities like electricity, School, Hospital and Road from Government. The village name is Nunaikundanala, Dist: Hailakandi, Assam.

We are indebted to u sir for creating this history sir
?
congrats ,
We admire your work. We know @narendramodi ji committed towards India. You are a true leader. 
@malviyamit
Namo 
@NielHirjee whats your say on this.
This is a great achievement.

@narendramodi government has brought electricity to about 30,000 villages in India, making our country 100% powered, as per @un criteria.

In 70 years other governments powered up > 500,000 villages, in 4 years NaMo did 30,000.

Bhakts: Modi, Modi.

#bhakts don't care about facts. They still think @narendramodi is @UNESCO awarded best PM.

If not 100% villages electrified, maybe > 90% have been: that is an improvement. In those things NaMo does not spread fear & hate, let's support him.

Great achievement and full filled the promise made by our respected PM, Sh. NARENDRA Modi.

Social media is for personal satisfaction.
Go to ground or at least watch news  channels..... Its not 100% till date

Well done PM Modi Ji. Kudos to you and the team delivering on ground performance . Task promised and completed on time. @PiyushGoyal @OfficeOfRKSingh #PowerfulIndia
Excellent work done by our gretested priminister and his team.
Why कांग्रेस is asking for accountability of 4 years from मोदीजी who is doing best work for our country where as last 70 year they had never given account to commom मन of country
This statement, right here..... is a tight slap on @INCIndia's face. Villages r getting electrified after 70 yrs of independence.
But some chutiyas will still vote for the Pvt. "family" Ltd.
It's a great work...was pending since long ! Thanks @PMOIndia @narendramodi
When we can have now 24 hrs uninterrupted power supply at every region in India? 

(the above was impossible to even demand before 2014 )

Ab yeh DIL MANGE MORE
Hats off Modi ji 
What Harvard n Cambridge educated PMs, FMs cud not do in 65-70 years , a chai wala from humble background  did it in 4 years! Jai ho! #electrification #MannKiBaat @PiyushGoyalOffc
Well said @connectgurmeet. NaMo has impeccable energy and dedication towards building strong India. We are witnessing better & stronger India.
137 years after Edison, 71 years after Independence, we finally have got 100% electrification . Next n more important challenge is ensuring 24*7 power to all households @UnSubtleDesi
Andh bhakt
Great achievement!! Now the target sud b 24hrs of power supply.. pls fix a target & achieve before targeted date.

There are many villages in bihar over kaimur hills where only solar light is available since last 10 years but there no electric pole till today and modi ji happy that......
उन गांव की पूरी डिटेल दीजिए और आप के संपर्क सूत्र दीजिए
Congratulations Sir.
When will every Indian girl access to security, when will every rapist access to punish and when will every politician will leave access to politics over this. #BetiBachaoBetiPadhao just sounds good!

Please provide light connection to them. Else agla Bharat Bhand hoga. Jai Bhole
Acc.  to there rule a village is declared electrified when there electricity is reached in only 10% houses of a entire village. But I also mention that this rule was made when there was congress govt. and acc. to this rule congress had already electrified 96% villages in india
Yes truly that was a phenomenal  and historic moment for our #Bhaarat ! Mahaa Bhaarat ! You are amazing, Mr. PM ! Thanks also for sending your wishes  birthday to me yesterday....feels amazing to get it from the country's Prime Minister !! Thank-you so much @narendramodi ji !!!
बहुत ही अच्छी कार्य शैली देश के लिए आपकी जो कि काबिले तारीफ है आप जैसा pm आजतक भारत का नहीं बना और शायद होगा भी नहीं चाहे वह सेना के लिए हो या राष्ट्रीय स्तर आय व्यय को लेकर या विकास को बढ़ावा देने की Bjp सरकार में बहुत ही सफल कार्य हुए है। मुझे गर्व है कि मै Bjp कार्यकर्ता हुं।
So Modi govt electrified 18,000 villages in 4 years. Roughly 4500 every year. Which is even not independently verified. 

@INCIndiaLive electrified 5,80,000 villages in 60 years. Roughly 9500 villages every year. Which is verified by Modi govt.

#Feku #jumla
जय हिंद  ये ज़रूरी था हो गया  लेकिन कांग्रेस को हजम नहीं हो रहा है
I am supporter of bjp and as well as @narendramodi but i know a village where electricity still not reached while many times twitted to pm, @PiyushGoyal ji @ptshrikant .

सर हकीकत देखनी है तो मेरे गाँव आईये आज़ादी से अभी तक बिजली नही पहुची है और आप कह रहे है कि देश के प्रत्येक गाव में बिजली की पहुच है।मैने ऊर्जामंत्री जी को कई ट्वीट किए ,आपकी ऐप पर शिकायत की व अधिकारियों के चक्कर काटे लेकिन निराशा हाँथ लगी।

हमें हमारे प्रधानमंत्रीजी व उनकी टीम पर गर्व है ! जो कहते हैं वो करते हैं ! समस्त देशवासियों से विनम्र निवेदन कृपया धीरज रखें - मोदीजी अपने सारे वादे पूरे करेंगें बस उन पर उनके देश के प्रति पूर्ण समर्पण पर ,विश्वास बनाए रखें ! @BJP4India @gopalkagarwal @VijayaRahatkar

Love you Sir.
Thanks pm sir for given electricity in18500 villages
Rampant corruption & inefficient governance by Communal @siddaramaiah has resulted in:
- Farmers committing suicide.
- Workers migrating due to lack of jobs.
- Youth missing out on employment opportunities.
- Poor suffering due to the absence of growth.

You are just an another politician who just does nothing 
But the bjp Karnataka has created visual ad contradicting your claim of complete electricity @INCIndia @INCKarnataka

Certainly 100% electrification was not achieved in 4 years.
I am sorry to say sir
This is not the correct information what is in circulation by government, still many villages are waiting for electrification work...

Unfortunately this is incorrect.. no electricity in our village.. no road either..attached article is 3 Yr old but situation is same as of now..
How many people have to live in a „village“? How many small groups of houses are left behind? India can’t dream being a super power any soon without providing minimal and basic infrastructure to anybody.
Congratulations sir
We are proud of you Sir...

We should name our roads for army jawans ie PVC, VC and also people who have done some good to society. Please make a beginning.
Govt needs to know that things have not changed on ground as those villagers are fleeing to cities and living the life similar to insects along roads and rail tracks :(
सभी को बहोत बहोत बधाई।
माननीय प्रधानमन्त्री जी अबतक हमारे गाँव मे बिजली नही पहुंच पायी है । बिजली बिभाग को २०१४से अबतक अनगिनत बार आबेदन निवेदन करने से भी वो लोग कुछ भी नही कर रहे है। बिधायक से फरवार्ड किया हुवा आवेदन का भी आज २ साल तक कोइ उत्तर नही आया है ।

मुझे बहुत खुसी ह की सभी गांव मे इलेक्ट्रिक मीटर लग रहे है। पर जो लोग कनेक्शन कर कर रहें हैं वो सभी गांव बालों से 100- 500/- तक बसूल रहें हैं। क्या इस पर कोई कंट्रोल नही हैं।ये सभी लोग कनेक्शन भी बीच मै जॉइंट लगा कर कर रहें है। इलेक्ट्रिक पोल से मीटर तक सिंगल केबल नही उपयोग हो
रहें हैं। ओर अगर ये 100- 500/- रुपये बसूल रहें है। तो स्लिप क्यो नही दे रहें हैं।क्या यह भी एक कररप्शन हैं। क्या इस पर कोई कंट्रोल है ।ये लोग कह  रहे हैं की 1200/- पर मंथ बिल आएगा। 500/- हमे दो तो कोंनेक्शन अभी कर देंगें।प्रतिदिन बैग भर कर ले जातें हैं।

बिल्कुल भी नहीं,कई बार बोला और ट्वीट भी किया,पर बिठूर विधानसभा क्षेत्र का गाँव खरगपुर सिर्फ 70 मीटर दूर रोड से,आज तक न बिजली है न सड़क है
Dear Modi ji please give correct information , may be all villages have electrified but you should assure all houses to be electrified
People refer to places support or deny certain problems in reply to others. If those places are mentioned it will be easy for govt to solve and others to know the reality.
Dear Sir Happy to see this... But as a citizen of India... You have promised that once ur in post.. You will deposit 15 lakhs in each of the Indian citizens account... Could you please let me when this will happen?
Marvellous deed, sirji..
God bless, let's continue this efforts to make drinking water, health care, life insurance, rights to employment reach every village. We would truly achieve progress

24 hours access to clean Energy to every villager is a step in the right direction towards development. There is need to make it reliable and low cost.
@narendramodi false information. Only in my district munger, there are 10% villages without electricity.
It's proudy moment of India.

Request to @ndtv please bring some remote village In news to defame this claim n wish you will do in coming days... expected from you
Heartiest congratulations to @narendramodi sir and his team. You made it happen in our country


And irony is that my village still doesn't even have electric poles installed. I hope my village belongs to India too. 
When would my villagers have the privilege to access electricity ? @narendramodi @PMOIndia https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/990455176581517312 …

Every single village has access but not every house. If only 10% of the village has electricity you are considering that as electrified and that too not 24/7 electricity.
only 3%  villages were remaining to be covered when new govt came in
Modi sir medical ki suveda kisi ko aap free mai mat do har admi par 100 ya 50 rupy har month lo par India ka wo har admi jo ye rupy de rha ho wo kisi ve Indian hospital mai govt ya private hospital mai total free treatment kar sake hai thik to kuch bole

Sir this is wrong information .There are still so many villages & rural areas where no reasonable progress is seen.moreover Beyond electricity there are basic needs for survival yet to be provided.We belong to those villages & rural area & I literally giving no credit to parties
