We do not want our care taken away, made unaffordable, or watered down just so the wealthy can pay less in tax.  This is wrong for the USA.
I havent been to doc in 6 yrs yet forced to pay thousands.. I Still dont wanna go pay high deductble..unusable healthcare thanks obama
Please fight the #AHCA for this man. TBI in 72 & in a 4 bed room paid by #Medicaid. Will they kill/evict him?
How about an updated photo and if you think they are killing him you the sick one
The videos of handicapped people being arrested & dragged out of @SenateMajLdr 's office made me cry! I'm 65 & sick (dying) I am terrified!
Be brave & believe in the true leaders that stand up and fight for what is right like @SenDeanHeller. He has bad commercials about him now!
IS THIS HOW YOU MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!??
Obama stole fannie freddie investment money to prop up 0 care or it woulda collapsed yr two all obama did was scam like hillary corrupt
Sen King. Thank you for showing sense in a sea of nonsense.
It better be a waste of time and not a law!!
Bill is blatant murder.  A party that touts Christian belief they are going to be judged according to the treatment of the poor and needy.
Thoughtful Republicans, like Susan Collins, will need support to meet the pressure of Senator McConnell and others. Prayers for America!
Sen King you were a great governor and now a great senator.  Reign in Collins if you can, she is a snake.
Thank you Senator! Please continue to stand strong against this terrible bill and urge @SenatorCollins to do the same. We need healthcare!
Separate from what he's saying (despite its importance), it's good to see Dems pushing King, an Independent. Shows they know who the base is
Kings base can't make up the mind that they,like him,are scummy Demacrat losers
The bill is devastating for Maine people. Potentially eight hospitals closing? Almost 1/4 of all facilities??
#VoteNoAHCA
#mepolitics
Medicare is NOT a benefit, it is a handout! Medicare is a working persons benefit!
I saw you on Morning Joe thank you I am a nurse practitioner in Philly who works in a low income hospital it will close we will lose jobs
Vote against it
Will WH/Congress and their families be covered under the GOP Insurance Plan?  If not, why not?  I would bet their not!
Such a great leader, I hope you can make it much better or vote no and help lead the way to it's defeat! You are 1 of my favorite Senators!
Thank you sir.
Thank you, Senator King!
Cruel indeed! #AHCAnotforME
Thank you for your commitment to doing what's right for the American people. Thank you for voting NO on #TrumpDeathCare.
You are a great man, a great representative of the people. I appreciate all you do. I'm sure millions of other do as well. Thank you.
.  "Die-in" on the Bar Harbor green protesting Trump Care at noon today.
Hope you can see your way to take care of us Mainers instead of voting for this bill. I know you folks in DC can do better...and should.
@SenAngusKing, TY for taking a stand against AHCA2 - I have a severe neuro cond. which will not b treated if it passes. Pls, stand firm, TY!
Thanks for standing up for the people. (I still think if ALL in government had to use the healthcare we'd be assured of the best!)
yes, it's terrible.  Won't help our family in Deer Isle Maine
We love you Senator. Keep up the very good work. Hold their feet to the fire.
I've accused you in the past of not communicating to the people of ME enough. Although I don't agree with u much this type of comm is needed
So u read n analyzed the whole thing in a few short hrs to make the conclusion it is bad. U r lying
Thank you for your 'No' vote. This bill will destroy the lives and savings of tens of thousands of Mainers including mine. Thank you! #ACA
I hope the Senate republicans realize they should not vote for this bill.
Why is it near impossible for you to convince even ONE more republican of the ludicrousness of such a bill?
Anyone who votes for this bill is participating in murder. Thank you for your strong stand against this insanity and cruelty.
You and your a cult should go back to Oregon
Thanks for your analysis.
thank God you're staying focused on what matters stop including Donald he does not matter irrelevant person
while Donald is up there disrespecting the presidency my father served in Vietnam not 4someone 2disrespect highest officenland
Thank you Senator King. Posting to FB. What senators should we contact?
Slay it Senator. The @GOP is emboldened. They are wrong to be... Americans won't accept their revocation of ACA. #2018 #WeRComing #BlueWave
Understatement of the century.
Please do what you can to defeat this travesty of healthcare reform.
Indeed! It's the same as saying the citizens of the US r all trash! @senateGOP #VoteNoAHCA Time to take the high road instead of the swamp
Please talk to Sen Collins about voting against this bill. She needs to stand with the people of Maine and against this travesty
Maybe it's just me but.... I'm sorry really doesn't make it better...
You should have been looking on K Street. That's where it was created. @SenAngusKing @MiaFarrow #DefeatGOP to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
How many medical doctors can you get from your state to post videos to Republican lawmakers?
This is the  time to stand for people.
Sir that's an understatement
I feel like republicans have no souls.It's sad to see what they're trying to do. I hope @SenatorCollins doesn't vote for it.
Love @SenAngusKing
Thank you for working hard to protect Mainers. Maybe you could have a word with @SenatorCollins ?!?!
I appreciate your leadership and wisdom
@sen.susancollins Angus, so sorry to see you become a part of the problem and offering no solutions. Make the turnaround for Maine's  sake.
You make more sense than anyone in Washington these days. Thanks for fighting the good fight.
I love you @SenAngusKing   I know you will do the right thing and say NO to AHCA
I know you will fight for Mainers, women, & all Americans who will be hurt, even die, with this excuse of a Bill. Don't stop! Thank you!
TY!  Pls convince @SenatorCollins to stand with you #NoCutsNoCaps
Angus, thank you for opposing this dreadful bill.
Please don't vote for this nastiness.
Will you run for President in 2020 - 
Americans deserve better with the healthcare bill. What a disgrace today in having the police remove those protesting to save their life.
THANK  YOU @SenAngusKing 
#TBT ... The definition (and images) of #EVIL

#EVIL #Trump #GOP #AHCA

â€¦
Will you please run for president?
Trump healthcare sucks why does the poor have to pick the Rich
Thank you Sir.
Thank you Senator Augus King.
I *hope* @SenatorBurr & @SenThomTillis are listening to their 99% constituency instead of being bullied by mitch and the greed-obsessed 1% 
Yep, destruction destruction destruction! All part of putin's plan to destroy the USA from the inside out ... with FULL @GOP cooperation 
Please explain the reasons it's so bad to @SenatorCollins. We need voices of reason. Fix the problems with the ACA don't destroy access.
McConnell drags people out of wheelchairs when they protest.  What say you sir?
@simplypjb thank you for taking the time to study the bill and determine your if it works for the American people.
Pretty bad? It seeks to kill and bankrupt as many Americans as possible, so they can give a giant tax cut to people who don't need it.
Thank you for your attention, please get @marcorubio  to stand up and do the right thing. He needs to be better than his "party".
Thank you for your service, sir!
can we start naming the #CEOS like that of Starr Company who will get a tax break? Call out the lobbyists who write this bill

I am so ashamed by my government.
Where's your plan?
No, Senator. Not "pretty bad". AN OUTRAGE. The visual of disabled protesters being hauled away at McConnell's request is DISGUSTING.
We love your work and commitment toward fairness in the #Russiaprobe
Thank you @SenAngusKing  for standing up for Mainers. I wish our other Senator would too.
Is there any committee or rational person 2 write 2 about the people being dragged out in wheelchairs today? It's disgusting & unacceptable.
You are cool
Help save the poor & marginalized, Sen. King! 23 million or more are depending on your voice. This is America, for God's sake.
Sen.KING, through all the loud, white noise I hear, it's your steady, calm, and most important, smart, common sense voice I hear.
Let's hope that @SenatorCollins does the right thing too for people in Maine who voted for her!
I am beginning to really like this man!
Thanks Angus!
Hunted ? Are you going to start hunting constitutes?
@MillieLou5
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP this is on YOU! History won't be kind. I know you don't give a fuck. I don't get it. Why did you want to be a Senator?
Convince Senator Collins of that!
Please do everything in your power to stop it! Thank you for all you're doing. #mepolitics
Of course it is. The @SenateGOP don't care about the disappearing middleclass & the poor. 
Good bless you @SenAngusKing!
@SenateDems Hopefully it will never pass
I think we should take healthcare away from McConnell.Tell him no matter how much money he has,he's ineligible to receive healthcare.
First time I have seen a white Angus, hey Senator what does your health insurance plan look like?
@SenateDems  For POTUS 2020
thank you Senator King!
Dems should draft their own health care bill!!! Make Dems proud of your efforts instead of just blasting GOP
@SenAngusKing @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenKamalaHarris u all R stupid American ppl need it 
Obama care dead 
Vote your #criminal party home
Am not surprised! Repubs take frm the poor & give 2 the rich! Robin Hoods they are NOT! Karma's a bitch, she's coming for them, claws & all!
I thank you Senator KIng - coming from a Mainiac family: Bath, Greenville, Waterville, Drew Plantation and Wytopitlock!  -
@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn @farenthold Work with @TheDemocrats and get a new bill put together!  Save hundreds of thousands of lives!
I say we give them the same as the dems. We need to pass it to know whats in it i guess thats not ok with you now
I wish you were king of more than just Maine.
Go get 'em Senator King! Thanks for fighting for us!!!
Burn it!!!
Make sure you and @SenatorCollins vote against this tripe!
Stay the course, Senator King.  The American People are counting on you and your colleagues.
Keep up your good work - you clearly advocate well for your constituency and you deal in facts and reasoning - with integrity!
Get to work and work fast!
Well then why not show us your bill so we can compare?
This is Government sanctioned GENOCIDE!!!! For what, for the RICH!! Anyone supporting this should stand trial for treason against the US.
Sounds sensible
More sensible than depriving 23 million people of health coverage.
Depriving? Last time I checked, healthcare isn't a right
And the rich receiving huge tax breaks is?
That doesn't even make sense, neither taxation nor tax cuts are rights
No you don't make sense and clearly have zero moral compass or comprehension of the role of government?
Being from MA & a Steven King fan it is kind of like one of his novels when you know what is behind the door is worse but you still open it
Thank you Senator King for your strong stand. 
Please confer with Senator Collins so that you both stand together against this wicked bill
I think we should take healthcare away from McConnell.Tell him no matter how much money he has,he's ineligible to receive healthcare.
You should have looked at the insurance lobbyists looks like they wrote the #Wealthcare bill!
#trumpcarekills #repealandreplacethegop
CALL BOTH senators and DEMAND they vote NO on #AHCA 202.224.3121.  #AHCA  affects EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN no matter what age they are! RT RT
As a constituent who called and got a real live person, I am grateful for your engagement with those you represent.
You are honnest Senator
We need more Independents like yourself Senator, tough talk is necessary in times like this.
Tough actions would be nice as well.
