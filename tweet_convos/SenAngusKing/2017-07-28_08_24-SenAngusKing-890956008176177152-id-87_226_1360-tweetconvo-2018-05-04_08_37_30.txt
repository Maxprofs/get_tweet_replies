Thank you Senator Angus King!  You are a true Patriot.  We honor your courage and your vote to save healthcare for the citizens of the USA.
Harsh.  Isn’t it enough you already caucus with them?
Not all heroes wear capes.

In every job there are "other duties as assigned"
Thank you...both of you sane & intelligent men! Nice tie Senator!

You're the Shaq to his Kobe. Great assist!

I was watching this and thinking "Poor Senator King" 
Nice knuckle grip as well!   Thx for all the big and little things you are doing for Maine.

Thank you!
Haha was watching on @cspan last night and was pretty sure that was you, thanks for doing your part Senator! 
If this whole "Senator" thing doesn't pan out, you can fall back on your first passion, being a sign-flipper guy.
Humility and humor, a winning combination! Congratulations on the vote.
Fun tie! And Thank You, Sir.
I love your lobstah ties.
Loving Angus
Would recognize you anywhere!
Senator visuals are important think of it as holding up the weakest of our Country
I have about 10 crab ties should you ever want to borrow one, @SenAngusKing. #CrustaceanDiplomacy
Takes a big man to admit that...

You're the best dressed human easel I've ever seen.
Senator, you missed a golden opportunity to give that bill the finger. Fight on!
How much did that sign cost?
Good to see you're not using scotch tape as a tie-clip.
You did good Senator King. A big thanks!
I think we've all been the hidden face behind the glory.
By the way, I'd love to take a selfie with you, @SenAngusKing
Every contribution helps!  Thank you #SenatorKing and #SenatorKaine for helping protect #AmericanHealthcare 
Thank you Angus for supporting the sign and not the repeal.
How busy were those poor printing companies over last few days? 
You're amazing. Keep up the great sign holding & questioning in hearings!
Best easel impersonation I've ever seen TBH. Well done.
Your lobster tie rocks the house like none other.
Lol! And, thank you for your NO votes!
Hahaha! Human easel!!That's a good one
Because you both ROCK and get the job DONE thank you from California #FAILUREFRIDAY
Your ability to laugh at yourself is a refreshing difference between you and many of your colleagues.  Love it!  Thank you 4 being human.
This is so priceless!
Senator, why don't you all have access to create digital presentations? The cost of printing those posters is not cheap.
It worked Senator! So thank you and:
Glad you didn't get a paper cut, oh wait, you have excellent healthcare and would have gone done as a martyr
Thank You!
Thank you Senator!
the Democrats appreciate your service sir. Holding the easel is our hazing ritual before we invite u into the fraternity of caucusing w/us!
Thank you for your service! Small price to pay to kill this bill.
Haha, proudly representin'
