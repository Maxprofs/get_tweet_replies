Why are you going to Washington.

You don't do anything significant there.
Please fight as you can, against latest ACA repeal bill. From what I've read it's the same bill, kept in the dark, shadowed by more lies.

Like watching Lindsay Graham and his HC bill. Sounds like a clever way out to me.
Please protect our healthcare when you go back! So many lives are depending on you. I'm stage 4 cancer and every day depends on good HC.
Pls defend us. #NoGrahamCassidy and no on extremist judicial noms Schiff, Barrett, Mateer, Kacsmaryk, Schwartz& Eid
