THANKYOU Senator King, from a neighboring Mass resident

I wish @SenJohnMcCain would talk to his constituents. I've called him 5X and faxed him twice. This is not regular order.
I actually talked to a real live person in Rubio's office today. First time ever. Not that it will do any good. I'm sure he's bought & paid4
Like apparently the majority of GOP IS BOUGHT & PAID for.
Bless you, work on susan. Graham was nuts calling single payer socialized....so is medicare. I love medicare, so do providers.
Thank you @SenAngusKing. The way the R's are going about this is getting ridiculous. Bipartisan now and open debates and hearings!
