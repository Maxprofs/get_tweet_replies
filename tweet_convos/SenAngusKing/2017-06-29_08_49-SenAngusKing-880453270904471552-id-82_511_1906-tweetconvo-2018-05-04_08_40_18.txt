This has to stop – we all have a job – 3 branches of gov’t and media.  We don’t have to get along, but we must show respect and civility.
Please do something
@SenatorCollins @realDonaldTrump Thank you both. I encourage you to tag POTUS to address directly
There is only one way Constitutionally to make this stop.
My God please make it soon.  I feel like every day forward we go back 10 years.  Its exhausting.
@realDonaldTrump needs to be prosecuted for these atrocities and pain inflicted on the American people and our country's reputation!
Fake president, that is.  I am not saying either of you are fake.
Senator u must know better--as said to Molly share with the united formed the evidence.   None ? Guilty without cause the Democratic mantra?
@SenatorCollins Maybe you two can get together over lunch and hammer out a real healthcare bill?
Their leaders would withhold precious re-election funds if they jumped the chain of command like that. Look what they did to Heller
Please, Senator, DO something.
@SenatorCollins Appreciate both of your efforts. Please keep in mind that Trump will not heed a call for decency. U must act.
Very constructive
When is congress going to remove this sick vengeful man from the office he is unfit to serve. Are you going to go down w him. Please save 
PLEASE do SOMETHING! Standing by a bully is almost worse than being one.
I love Angus King!
Every day that all of you don't demand the house impeaches this monster is a wasted day!
I've had it with this administration but feel powerless.
Respectfully, you DO have to get along, you can respectfully disagree and politely decline to go along but, getting along is imperative
But, in the end she will support him with her vote ... same old, same old.
I'm looking for a stronger response from you. This is the President of the United States we are talking about.  - Trevett, ME resident
I wonder what #trump is distracting the American public from now....
Please call @realDonaldTrump out directly.  Behavior is unfitting for the office he holds and he should be called our for it by leadership.
Had to reply-Obama red line caused 400,000 Syrian deaths-why didn't you all call him out for impeachment-oh their not Americans so who cares
Except those who oppose Obamacare, then it's ok to call them "murderers", right Angus? #hypocrite #mepolitics
"Who will rid us of this meddlesome Pr...esident?" Congress, I pray. After all, we'll never find @realDonaldTrump in a church! #TrumpRussia
Let's add treat women w/ respect, call out acts of sexism, and absolutely no justification of such behavior from any man especially @POTUS
This administration is a complete embarrassment.
Thank you sir.
It has to be done right, vote it down until it's right and fair for all. We cannot afford another government disaster like ACA
This is all fueled by one very very sick man who you call President if you really care and want it to stop impeach his sorry ass!!!
Please do something to save us from that monster!
Would you and/or @SenatorCollins call @realDonaldTrump out right here though?
Hurrah!  Surely if he were still among us, General Patton would agree that Washington is "finding its chest".  Now is the time...
@SenatorCollins please, please take a firm stand against the child king.  He must be stopped!
She'll still vote in lockstep with him though. Disingenuous at best.
@SenatorCollins  Condemning individual tweets does NOTHING. Stop enabling this maniac across the board. Where are the calls for an apology?
Do you think you are a good example? Do you think your attacks on the President and GOP caucas is OK? I don't!
Well...how about making sure Americans don't die. That would be real cool.
I want you both to call him out directly. If you can't then we should look for people that can.
Is this directed @POTUS or Joe & Mika or both? Pretty silent on their tone Senator
25th amendment requires 1/2 of cabinet to agree with removing Trump. Not happening.
Maybe she should say it to the POTUS firsthand then, instead of a "backwards channel" tweet. Collins has failed ME time and time again
Can we have show some civility and decorum as an example for our youth? I am embarrassed as a parent, this not how we govern!
You people aren't going 2 do a damn thing. And @realDonaldTrump will get worse, & he'll tweet some horror, & you'll tweet stern words.
#Boo
@SenatorCollins ever hear of "censure"?
Sure, y'all are shocked by what #45 says. Where was that rightous indignation when #45 insulted Gold  Khan fam? Or disabled reporter? #ACT
Sen King, we're tired of both parties denouncing what #45 says & does. Stop waiting for R. Mueller 2 do your job OF GETTING him out.
Hooray for senators Collins & King.  No now let's show some action
I agree with the words, now show us some ACTIONS!!
When is CONGRESS going to stand up and tell him this? Hold him accountable? This is beyond unacceptable.
Nothing will change until you change it.
I got talk to u guys. We have talk. U and suey. .. Hope u talk I live in Maine
Proud of our senators from Maine
So do something about it. Man,  I am sick of this inaction. I respect you, Sir. Please help your country out.
I agree whole-heatedly, but pessimistically.  After all disrespect and incivility is what got Donald Trump elected.
There are many idiots in this country!
I hope you run for President. You are IMO an incarnation Teddy Roosevelt. A true statesman and someone I would be proud to call my POTUS
Article 25 should be being discussed.
Somebody has to get a hold of DT. He is a embarrassing bully! Who treats people the way he does?
@SenatorCollins thank you Senator King and Senator Collins..#bipartisan solutions
Ok Reps do something. This man is killing us. Daily.
Finally! Something that we can ALL finally agree on across the partisan party spectrum.Trump has turned the WH into reality TV
@SenatorCollins Thank you to both of you. This is not acceptable in any way.
Then do something about it. Censure him in the senate.
How much longer, Senator? It has been only 5 months. How much longer must the country endure this?
Then say it in your own words @SenAngusKing !
It would of been an endorsement if you sent it to @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @Reince45 @SarahHuckabee
Who voted for him when he said he liked grabbing women's genitals?
Good to know you are fighting for the Globlist elite and communists alike.
amen.
A little assistance @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP now do something about it!
Yes! And all we hear from Republicans is "elections have consequences" they need to understand  elections also come with responsibilities!!
