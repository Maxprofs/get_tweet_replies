.@SenJohnMcCain Will you push for a special prosecutor to investigate and bring those who violated 18 USC 2340A to justice?
@JoshRosenau @SenJohnMcCain LOL. Your precious Holder couldn't get it with all his King's men.
.@bradcundiff I asked @SenJohnMcCain to create an independent prosecutor to investigate the Bush torture regime. How does your reply relate?
@JoshRosenau @SenJohnMcCain I don't relate to leftist nuts. Enjoy your Berkley fantasies.
.@bradcundiff Like @SenJohnMcCain, I know that we prosecuted waterboarding as torture after WWII, want to live up to the same standard now.
@JoshRosenau our fliers in Vietnam and SOF are water-boarded as part of their training. It is not torture the way it was done to KSM.
@bradcundiff My point is that @SenJohnMcCain, who knows something about “our fliers in Vietnam” agrees that it was torture, wrong, illegal.
@JoshRosenau no, your point is that McCain is a tool for now for your agenda of weakening America down to size.

@SenJohnMcCain do you follow @ICITorg ?
@SenJohnMcCain The United States needs you to do this. You & all other honorable, fearless members of Congress left! The people will support
@SenJohnMcCain Please, stand up and call loudly for laws that criminalize torture and ensure accountability, and please do not stand down.
@SenJohnMcCain Wall St: no prosecutions. Administration, CIA: no prosecutions. BlackLivesMatter: no prosecutions. This has become systemic.
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you Sir for being a reasonable voice, and for speaking the truth. You are a inspiration.
@SenJohnMcCain You're a senile moron & useful idiot for America hating libs. The report was intended to harm CIA & US. Shut up and resign.

@SenJohnMcCain Thank you Mr. McCain for your courage and your willingness to make a stand on this issue! And thank you Senator Feinstein!
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffreyGoldberg But conscience about what? If--just IF--NOT using torture allows another 9/11, you feel no pangs over that?
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffreyGoldberg The difference between the US and its enemies is primarily a question of military power. Forget conscience.
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffreyGoldberg Strongest statement McCain has made in years.

@SenJohnMcCain @abbeysbooks But I do still want to bomb everyone

So, @SenJohnMcCain @AngryVoters Feeding the enemy w this "report", knowing it will incite terrorists against our own troops is "conscience"?
"Our enemies act without conscience. We must not." @SenJohnMcCain on CIA torture report. Transparency leads to a #MorePerfectUnion.
@SenJohnMcCain, you are reflexively pro-war but want credit for being anti-torture. This is BS.

@AngryVoters
@SenJohnMcCain As Benjamin Ferencz explained, going to war includes many war crimes & human rights abuses.

@AngryVoters
@SenJohnMcCain, You should understand that war includes human rights violations, but you don't.

@AngryVoters
@SenJohnMcCain Ha ha ha! Senile old crapper @AngryVoters
@SenJohnMcCain  thank you for never being afraid to speak the truth.
@SenJohnMcCain you are the one person who can honestly speak on this issue 
Please run for president again
@SenJohnMcCain Since you don't mind the release of the #TortureReport, how about getting the Fast & Furious & Obama's Drones documents!

@SenJohnMcCain Powerful words from someone who knows all to well about this subject. No one could have said it better. #TortureReport

@SenJohnMcCain great job!!!!
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for your words today.
@SenJohnMcCain I agree! I would rather loss the war on terror than lose the moral high ground. Otherwise what separates us from them?
@SenJohnMcCain Should those that tortured detainees be tried for war crimes and imprisoned?  Otherwise aren't we just allowing it again?
@SenJohnMcCain If we are not enlightened enough to love our enemies, let's at least have the decency not to torture them. #TortureReport
