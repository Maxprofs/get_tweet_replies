Thank you hun you too
I remember going to your concert in Greensboro, North Carolina and the concert was cut short because you was not feeling good. I sure was disappointed
I literally heard that song when I read “let’s go girls” hahahahaa. #ManIFeelLikeAWoman
You go girl
I love you Shania thank you for your courage and strength. You are a true woman to follow. Thank you.
#InternationalWomensDay  #IWD2018
ok but did anyone else sing “let’s go girls”?
That is so awesome, Shania, I try to do a lot of humanitarian things, & of course, being a 55 yr. old woman, I support women's rights, but, then again, I'd like to think that I just try to help anyone who's in need! You go, girl!
So glad you are back singing
Happy Women's Day.

Congratulations!
And, you, Shania, are really one of the great women.
