Could we not support this Trump supporter, please?

You're Still the One! 
Hey @RuPaul what do you have to say about @ShaniaTwain being a @realDonaldTrump fan? @RuPaulsDragRace fans need to know if we should stop watching.
Shania was the worst judge ever...and that statement.. #sasheyaway honey.
Is it finally happening? Are we going to be blessed with the iconic "Man, I Feel Like a Woman" as our LSFYL song?
omg! the queen #hailtothequeen
People have got to get a grip. I doubt she paid much attention to what was really going on. She's not invested as an American would be - doesn't she now live in Switzerland? Plus, she was likely talking about the context of back then before the election.
Yes!
Goodbye Shania, no longer a fan because you support a racist, sexual predator, philanderer and a liar.
@ShaniaTwain is a total package icon with achievements that other artists from all genres only can dream of. "Come On Over" is the best selling female album of all time as well as the best selling country album of all time. AMAZING!
How can Shania Twain be on Ru Paul's Drag Race and want to vote for Trump and Pence?
Trump joked that Pence wants to hang all the gays.  Pence wasn't joking.
If Pence feels that way how does Twain feel? People will do anything to make money.  Wonder what she really thinks of gays
mom. i swear if you don’t do that song for lip sync for your life tonight there WILL be problems.

Best guest judge for me! Wig gone
Man I wish she would’ve talked more she’s SUCH an icon and inspiration
She's no friend of the LGBT community.  Please stop promoting her.

I’ve always thought Shania Twain was vapid. 

Her quote on why she would have voted for Trump pretty much nails that case shut. 
Love your candor! You’ll have to bow down and apologize or get unshackled by the machine. The choice is yours. #MAGA #UniteForHumanity #GreatAwakening
Oooh!!! Can’t wait. :)
Ooohhhhh guuuuuurl !!!
come on, shania taint!
Yup ill watch it 
Shaia the best
A Man I Feel Like A Woman lip sync
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TE AMO RUPAUL 
My childhood is dancing to this video.
Hey Shania, I am guessing you have been grabbed by the Pussy against your will a few times and liked it.  What a disgrace for Canadian but you are now officially stupid enough to vote Trump therefore are now an American.
She wishes she could’ve voted for man who hates your very existence. I was a big fan too but it’s time to drop her.

If @miz_cracker doesn’t get to watch herself win... on her FREAKING BIRTHDAY... 

Y’all, Ru better fix her judgement.
OK, let me call an Uber ... oh, wait
Yes mam I was living for your garment last week
