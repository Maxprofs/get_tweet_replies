Good stay in Ottawa.  I wasn't being complimentary when I said to stay in Canada so I don't know why you liked my comment. Stay there with your liberal President Trudeau!
Soooo Gorgeous!!!
A celebrity play-acting. Having served for 14 years in the RCN i can tell you this, no you're not doing us a favour, we don't need your "support". Spare us the photo-ops they just eat up our time. We know this when it gets real we're the ones covering your ass. . #heartofoak
You look great even stuffed into all that gear!
Its unanimous. You are gorgeous bet you haven't heard that before. The soldiers will love you . Cheers.
