Forever the Twain shall greet.
Darlin',

Not today baby, I'm devastated by the loss of my guillotine. 

Sick of pretending you're here, I'll fix that for I made up my mind... I'm going away.

Can you confirm if the eternal controlling over the Crowe's entertainment is fulfill and absolved from the Russelin'?TY

Really cool
Same here
The writer who wrote, "Never the Twain shall meet," was wrong. 

That’s a class gesture. Prayers to all. Well done.
