We got you no matter what
"It doesn’t mean you can’t run and you can’t run well; it’s just running differently now" I admire your optimism Shania...I really do
No one need to worry! 
whether it’s “Old Shania” or “New Shania” There will always be only one Shania - The one and only @ShaniaTwain 
Shania is simply the best!! Been a fan of her for most of my life and can’t wait to see her in concert soon. Very well written article too, so props to the writer on that!  
New album is great. Who’s gonna be your girl  is awesome mystical song
 older I get and more I know about Shania, the more I really appreciate her.
Strong woman who deserves all her success. 
@ShaniaTwain I read this yesterday and now you share it  I honestly think you're amazing anyway and now just even more amazing after getting through everything and coming back making great music and being happy
SHANIA TWAIN is a real life "Wonder Woman".  God Bless and Protect Her Always !!!!
I feel that. But we kept you in our hearts. Just like Forrest loved Lieutenant Dan...and saw him just the same after he lost his legs. That's just the same kinda love we have for you. You're a living legend. Nothing can take that away.
So glad you are back
her voice sounds beautiful. such a woman!
