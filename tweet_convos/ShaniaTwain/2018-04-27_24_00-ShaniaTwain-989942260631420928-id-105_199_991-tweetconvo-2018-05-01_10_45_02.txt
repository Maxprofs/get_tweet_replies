See you in Detroit!
Go away.
Are you performing or apologizing. You lost me as a fan!
Then why are you on her page?
Well your still on her page. Your not very smart are ya?
Actually yes I do how it works. It’s obvs you don’t. But have fun bashing Shania. Only weak person here is you.
@ShaniaTwain is the one who cowered, @renee1_usa hasn't, so how do you consider her the weak one? 
You #ScrewedThePooch with your comments on #Trump geaux back to #Canada & take #Trump with you. 1one thing ur an #Indian do you support him #StealingTheirLand ? 
She should take Raphael Cruz back with her.
@OSOFLIII ..GO LISTEN NOW!

“T.H.O.T Love” out now.!  go vibe to that shit share&& likehttps://youtu.be/8hEME4zi8tQ 
Is this "job" the reason you back peddled on your Trump vote statement?  Were you afraid of losing the TODAYSHOW?  bahahahaha!  shameful
Will you be singing a “strong woman” song? That’s all it will be, lyrics, no meaning. Should not have cowered to the mob of haters, if you truly believe what you write.
How is that free Canadian health care? Trump cut off our health care for our sick and dying, and he is destroying the environment for future generations. Are you trying to start a new fashion statement with the leopard print outfits? Such a trendsetter!
Hi how are you bill
$295 per seat sounds pretty top 1% and Trumpian to me. I guess you are no longer a woman of the people.
PASS
Sorry.  We remember what u said about trump - u don’t live here. He is Fucking Gross. Why don’t u take him. We don’t want him. Won’t listen to your music anymore.  Sad.
In sure you got bullied.. fkem and follow youre instincts... theyre right on
20.00 tix for your venues 70% unsold.   20.00 tix next to ppl who originally paid 150.00..ouch...they gonna be sooo mad lol
Unless someone says something negative and you change your mind.  Boo to you
Hey Shania good luck out there by uourself
Nice lip-sync...if that's all ya' got, call it a day...
No thank you sell out —- me and mine stand up for our values
Hello from Canada.  Love that you are back!
flopped
cant wait to see you shania!!! love your song so much :*
nah, cause Trump will be 'slobbing' over you. @TODAYshow  total fail for putting the canadian Trump backer but I sink for all dem peoples on your show. Retire sweety!
Who cares
Just sold my ticket to your show, maybe that person will enjoy your hypocrisy.
Surely Trump will be there
You used to be my fav artist for decades until you mouth overloaded you insulting our President!  Really?!?!?
Ps I Could care less ANYMORE...you and all the hollywood  hypocrites who think your opinion will determine ours!!!!! Egos are really big in celebrity land!
I’m not in favor of supporting weak women.
Trump supporter! Hell no
You go Goddess
#ShaniaTODAY
Won't be watching a facis.t Canadian singer like you.
Can’t wait. Looking forward to Shania owning her original statement about voting for President Trump if interviewed about that! No regrets or back tracking. We love you for who you are and you will always be an American Icon!!
So why didn’t you stick with what you said re TRUMP!! What made you back down? Was it What else could it be? Sad for you, no backbone?
Think I'll stay home and change my living room curtains. Yellow belly woman... Appeasing bum kisser. 
Not no voice
So happy! Can’t wait!!!
You are a has been,please stop singing,it's awful !
I guess you (some  appear(xxoo)to want to see us married now suggesting we have  a wedding on the Ottawa) realize how excited I am to finally meet you so we need to spend a little time together when you get here, cudles!
Shania, have fun on the Today Show, and be careful of the two winos Kathie Lee and Hoda, they will try to get you smashed before you do your number.  Ha-Ha - just kidding, they will probably wait until you finish your song.
BELOW IS THE = >> REAL- TRUTH <<  OF OUR PRESIDENT / CLICK LINK BELOW;
==================================
You wobbly,girl!
I'll be watching
We would have watched if you hadn't rolled.
HELLO = N-TRUTH WE - THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE OUR COUNTRY R N AN ALL OUT WAR 4 THE VERY SURVIVAL OF AMERICA = THE LEFT RADICAL LIERS WANT 2 DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY = WE MUST WIN 2 SAVE OUR COUNTRY & OUR CHILDREN = PLEZZ DO NOT ALLOW THESE LIERS 2 SHUT U UP + DEMAND U "THINK" LIKE THEM
I was proud that you weren’t afraid to state your belief, but then to change because people gave you crap, hmmm guess I’ll unfollow.
Such a disappointment, you folded like a house of cards once you got a little pressure for supporting our President.  Just can’t watch such a spineless entertainer.  #KanyeTrump
Oh take your hate some where else.
Life would be better if you didn't gutlessly cave in to liberals.  Never thought I'd respect Kanye more than you.
Sorry  @ShaniaTwain for selling your soul just to stay good with the looney Left.
#Trump 
#MAGA
PLEASE SING WE GOT SOMETHING THEY DONT on #ShaniaTODAY
Will you sing "We Got Something They Don't"? I'm so eager to hear that live. One of my top favorites from NOW. 
Will that be on tv?
Wish i was there in person, but will be watching on tv for sure. You will do another amazing concert on the Today show..
Can’t wait girl!!
Open your heart and you will know
Throw the illusion of night blindness.
How can you not understand:
The sun is a bright ray, the ray is you.
This song is talking to a lot of women like me. That gives back the smile I adore it ! 
You apologized for liking Trump. You are a disgrace.
Omg. Yes!!!
Can't wait to see you on #ShaniaTODAY! I've got an idea, @TODAYshow @Citibank and Shania, how about making #ShaniaTODAY a thing everyday.... #ShaniaEVERYDAY! That would be even better! It would be the best show on tv! 
#TrumpTwain #BoycottShania

So excited for this!  

Absolutely my FRIEND.....
It's all GOOD!!
I'm so proud of you TODAY and everyday my FRIEND!!!!!!!!!!
How to get VIP passes? @ShaniaTwain @CitiPrivatePass? @TODAYshow @cit

#NationalConcertWeek
#TodayShow
I thought you were a strong woman but your not your weak I and my daughters are very disappointed in you and we will only support strong women who are not afraid to stand up to hate!
Then get off her page.
“...we will shout and be singin’ along”!! 
Love you Shania  
That don’t impress me much

Wonderful! 
I can't wait it! 
it would be fitting that you would also apologize to everyone after this announcement.

You caved to the mob.  I can no longer respect you.
Then get off her page.
Will you be performing one of the new NOW songs on the show?
