I love my favorite country singer so much Shania Twain is so Hot

Then and #ShaniaNOW 
We Love you Queen  ! 
Hugs!
No problem! 

There’s a special force of energy that She has. It’s never left. It’s meant for others to share and Her energy helped me in rough times It’s healing power to listen to Her music When Shania hits those lower warm notes you can tell it’s her after only one note no one else has that
This is a good article.
