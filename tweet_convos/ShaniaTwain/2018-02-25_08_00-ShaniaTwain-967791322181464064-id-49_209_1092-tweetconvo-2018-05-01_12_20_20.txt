I spent 1350 dollars on the omaze campaign! Money that I could have used as a supplement to one of these VIP tickets! Tickets you didn't care to tell about before the omaze campaign even started. Donations to the same charity!
Just received this in my inbox. Where are the European meet and greet opportunities??? Why don't we get the chance to meet you??? How much money do we have to spend further?
