I will and I promise to get you and Aubrey something. Like I said. And I wish I could help you make your dream come true you deserve it. Truly. I am too, super excited each time. Especially travelling internationally
I'm still trying to figure out how to ship you yours! I already responded this, but guess it was on the wrong tweet So, just so you'll know I'll be expecting pictures of you in the shirts I'm sending you! Aubrey had something else to say, but aint sayin it out here!
You have to get international stamps for the postage or it won't leave America. And of course I'll take pictures in the shirts you're sending me when I get them.

Are your comments in support of Trump true? @JessieSpano1
Why? You have a problem with her having her own thoughts & not a puppet Lib!
You love Shania Twain
poems:
The beauty of the actress is so deceptive
And this leads to vain hopes.
This means nothing,
And in my destiny everything is still.
I was going to go, but now that you have cowered to the Lefty Lib Loons I am reconsidering.
