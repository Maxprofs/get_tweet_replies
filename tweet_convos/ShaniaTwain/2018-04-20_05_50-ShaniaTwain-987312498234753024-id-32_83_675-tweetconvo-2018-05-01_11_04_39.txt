Seriously you visited the CAF?!?!?!?! And you said Trump was an honest man?!?!?!?
Where's the hat Shania?!!!  blow up the internet please
COWARD!!!!!  
Why do you allow “others” to dictate what YOU can say, or how you are allowed to think???  Stop being Weak!  And stand with your OWN beliefs along with 75%+ of Americans who support President Trump?!

If Shania stinks, she would fit right in with the SJWs.
They should say "you welcome queen !!!!"
@MARPAC_FMARP thank you
