Pistachio ice cream is heaven 
Why not ..... Lmao

Ice cream and sweets are more suited for breakfast than dinner. Why eat all that stuff right before bed instead of to start your day. You’re welcome.
I LOVE U CARDI

bardi gangvgggvv
Strawberry cheesecake ice cream


Same
No one will tell you no. #FeedTheBaby lol
Maybe eating ice cream for breakfast isn’t the smartest thing to do for growing a baby? How about some actual nutrition? Vitamins? Minerals? Poor baby, not even born and already exposed to the worst possible foods smh

Atta girl 
Hell yeah!  It has pistachios in it that makes it healthy.  I justified having Oatmeal Raisin cookies for breakfast cuz it's oatmeal & raisins, that's healthy!
I love that gelato too...
I had an apple pie sundae for dinner, so do it up!
Yum! Love it too!
Yes girl
No don't do it
That's why people say you got some mental problem and shit 

#DatWay
