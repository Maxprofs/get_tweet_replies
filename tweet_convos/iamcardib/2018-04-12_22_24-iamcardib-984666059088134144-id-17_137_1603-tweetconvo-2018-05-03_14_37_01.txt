She letting him know to be careful
With the exception of @OffsetYRN
Be careful is such an incredible song. It's about time this perspective has been available thru song. Everything this woman has accomplished is inspirational and every time somebody says they don't understand her, I know they don't understand our culture. 

Thank You Cardi B.
