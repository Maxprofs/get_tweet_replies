I scream Get up 10 lyrics in the mirror while I’m brushing my teeth 
Issa mood

Don’t gas me lol you know I’m bringing all my niggas on the come up 
Twitter famous 
Don’t gas me 
Great way for you to be a hater 
If you're a low self esteemed aspiring thot i bet it is.
If you are a retarded asshole pos fat shamer who couldnt handle a real women ever in his life i bet when she tweeted you back your low self-esteem went up also
Dont worry man white knighting will get you in there one day
Im married with two kids thats what being a man got me
So why do you waste your time talking shit on twitter just don't seem very happy buddy
People who get triggered over topics like fat shaming or anything of the sort; have insecurities of themselves personally. Mcwhiteknight is an overweight man, probably felt some kind of way. Pretty amazing how he judged this women as a "real woman" based on one persons diss.
Every morning since it dropped 
Yup it is the jam!    #CardiB #Winning
