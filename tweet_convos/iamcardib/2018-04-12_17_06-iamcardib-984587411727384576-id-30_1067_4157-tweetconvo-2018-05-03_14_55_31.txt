Only reason I skip Bodak Yellow and Bartier Cardi is because I played them so much I be ready to listen to the new shit just as much. Once they catch up on spins I can replay them 

True. Her whole album is full of bops. One of my favorites is Money Bag. I hope that  it is released as a single.
Money bag is one of my faves too
I skippef the WHOLE album wym?????
You need to speak up and stop making Nicki look like the bad person here. You doing all the talking behind screen making it look like she the only one doing shit. if you were really all about women empowerment you would’ve said something by now.
Every song can be a single!! But I hope she put out I Do next and I Like It for the summer
I love all of the songs except the hook of “she bad”, its too repatative for my taste but I’m sure its a great club song
Trying make her feel better shame
