I WONDER WHAT VIRAL GIRL PINK FEEL like 
I’m still broke 
 “WHEN A RICH NIGGA WANTS YA”

No because you went viral
Cardi retweeted it thats the only reason lol 
Let me mention her in some shit  get my followers up
That’s the thing I didnt mention or tag her 
How many of these cardi “I felt that shit” tweets are people going to keep doing cause this shits tired
How many fucks you think they give? 
Clearly none it’s just tired 
Then dial tone *Click*
I use to think the lyrics said “you going wake up like why you got a knife” not “you going wake up like why you got an attitude”  shows how crazy one is I guess 
I just relistened to this song and it’s like the lil jon thing all over again
@iamcardib we got a t-pain buy a drink type situation with thru your phone lyrics
