You still trynna do a collab with a UK artist sis? You and @LadyLeshurr would be 

Of course Cardi. There's mad love 4 u in the UK & we gutted that u not coming to Wireless now. Nuff peeps saying they selling their tickets 
International travel probably not the best for a pregnant woman.
Oh yeah I agree & she'll probably be having the baby around then. But if shows how much love @iamcardib gets.... A whole day of artists & peeps talking bout cancelling tickets cos she's not gonna b there...
Just...
DROP THE I LIKE IT VIDEO AND SLAY US ALL
Chill. Let her get through her pregnancy like damn!
I said “drop it” because it was already recorded weeks before the album dropped. The video has to be in editing stages at this point.
Did u see that Lady Gaga tweeted you twice the other day?
Yeeeees i hope to see Cardi b and Lady Gaga work together
Still not sold on that combo. Just thinking about it makes my ears hurt.
Yes, I did see the tweet you deleted.

First of all, I love Cardi B. Why the fuck you think I'm here in the first place? I don't listen to Gaga anymore. I just don't think that their voices or music styles would go well together.
Yes they will go well together there both good artists and they can make hits together
