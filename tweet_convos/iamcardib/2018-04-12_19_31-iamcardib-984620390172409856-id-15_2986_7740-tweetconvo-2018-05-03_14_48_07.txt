Unfortunately it's by Pardisson . Imagine a world with a creative and truthful Cardiac, wow what a world that would be.
@Dj_Molinari
HUGE MOOD
The only mood
AAGH INSTANT NOTIFICATIONS FROM EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER NOOOOOOO
Be Careful has a BIG writer list LMAOO
Because she sampled Ex Factor from Lauryn Hill who sampled it from Wu Tang Clan who sampled it from somebody else etc. they are all credited
Exactly. She canâ€™t come up with her own lyrics 
He's talking about her not writing her own lyrics which she admitted too LMAOO jdjsjsj there was even a vid of her Ghost writer listening to his version of the song fjdjjsjsh
He is talking about the 17 writers on Be Careful which were there because the Ex Factor sample was also sampled from another song which was also sampled and so on, so all the writers get credit. Pardi is credited so he is a co writer, unlike poor Safaree
Im talking in general too 
This song is the shit!!

I love it that niggar better be careful
literally EVERYDAY
