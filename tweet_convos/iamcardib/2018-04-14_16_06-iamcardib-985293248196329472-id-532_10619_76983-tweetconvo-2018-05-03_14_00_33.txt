he woulda been like "BELCALIS-"
Yup just like that 
No this one
Ouch

I thought this was gonna be a funny add on  but it wasn’t...
lol @iamcardib sweetie for that story to be true you would need to be writing your own songs ...
Uh uhhh u came here for that
Sure did
You fav Taking  L’s tho 
lol how am I taking a L ?
I didn’t.....
My Fav is taking a L with her two new singles being in the top 3 of iTunes for 48 hours? Yeaaaaah, didn't think so 
I keep seeing people say this but everytime I go to top charts it’s:
bickenhead makes me wanna be a nasty hoe lol 
“This for all the nasty hoes “
From across the globe!
Bwock bwock (sounds right)
Dont matter. . . bickenhead wouldve still made me hit that shit
What time Cardi play at Coachella tomorrow?
6:00-6:35
Thanks! I hope they streaming it, I didn’t see her name in the lineup on Coachella’s YouTube channel.
I know  I went on their website to find it and it's 6 pm. on the west coast but 9 pm for the east coast 
But you get up 10 right? 
The just made my entire day cause that line was on my mind
That’s what I thought you said & I was too crunk like 

Bickenhead makes me wish I had an ass to twerk. Lord knew I didn’t need to be doing all of that lol

@iamcardib only people that was brought up the old skool way would understand this statement

Cardi I just watched a video u said and just so u know I farted
When i first heard : Get some guap, guap, get some chicken guap, guap get some bread. I was like OH MA GOD this is serious.
You could’ve used it for those who really don’t know where their daddy at 

Why would you want to perpetuate that stereotype anyways? Its not cool to not have a dad ¿
Deadddddddddddddd

Hi lisa!!!   you?
You had to come out again as an artist.  You followed some of the others coming back as an artist.   Like michel j./Ne-Yo...  2pac/kerri hilson... Whitney Houston/zendaya coleman.
