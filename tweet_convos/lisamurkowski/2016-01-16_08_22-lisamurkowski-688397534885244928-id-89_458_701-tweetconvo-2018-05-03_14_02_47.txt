@GeorgeFlynn3 @cnnbrk so you were at the negotiating table were you? Fascinating! Typical republican who knows everything/nothing
@cnnbrk some people suck tweeting about the price of freedom for our fellow Americans.
.@cnnbrk @cnn @abcnews @AP @CBSNews @DailyMail @foxnews @NBCNews Still no MT of US Hostage #RobertLevinson in Iran
#Breaking: on US Hostage Swap. 1 American #RobertLevinson, (Captive: Mar. 9, 2007) was not MT in Release https://twitter.com/NetAdvisor/status/583458133663555585 … #News
RT @cnnbrk Senior U.S. administration officials confirm release of 4 American prisoners by Iran.
@cnnbrk 
Now tell them you lied and you're not going to release the money. 
@cnnbrk Ted Cruz only praised God for the Christian pastor being released. The rest of the hostages could have stayed in Iran.
@cnnbrk can someone remind Cruz that the president serves ALL Americans and not just Christians.
@cnnbrk So, who did we release? And more importantly, were they criminals?
@cnnbrk at what cost to the United States? You know this wasn't unconditional.
@cnnbrk correction: it was a 7 for 4 swap. Of course.

@cnnbrk Looks like only Americans are human beings. Did any one know that the US was holding 7 Iranians who they exchanged for their people?

“@cnnbrk: Senior U.S. administration officials confirm release of 4 American prisoners by Iran. http://cnn.it/1RVVGNF ” yes! #SaeedAbedini
@cnnbrk YEA, how many did we have to give them?  We always get the shaft! So, 20 ? 50 ?  How many?
@cnnbrk No comment for the new friendly talk between U.S and Iran. Is that is new scenario in the chapter of foreign politics with Iran.
@cnnbrk all this good faith wonder what's really up, we are talking about Obama's regime here. Good news non the less #welcome home
@cnnbrk great  who r we releasing 2 iran?
@cnnbrk @CNN Happy for release. But ironic that this was done after 13 hours movie was released. Coincidence?
@cnnbrk GOP if you would not have made the deal, what would you say to the families of these prisoners.
@cnnbrk GOP going to spin this & say that the deal shouldn't been made, especially Trump.
@cnnbrk see diplomacy works..all that matters is we got the sailors&the prisoners back.i pray for the one who's missing.

@cnnbrk Being Trapped in Iran sucks. But if you REALLY look into the Levinson case, it was sheer MASSIVE stupidity for him to go over there.

@cnnbrk GOP candidates statements today prove that they rather go to war with Iran.
@cnnbrk GOP candidates would rather send our sons & daughters to war with Iran and have the US involved in a long war rather than diplomacy
@cnnbrk Iran got the deal they wanted from the USA. No need for them to keep the bargaining chips.  #IranDeal #takentothecleaners
@cnnbrk GOP candidates would rather drag the US to war with Iran than diplomacy.
@cnnbrk AMEN!!!
@cnnbrk Iran collecting those brownie points
@cnnbrk GOP candidates will spin this of course.
@cnnbrk GOP candidates will you ask that the freed prisoner be vetted before entering US because of the region and them being dual nationals
@cnnbrk @CNN This is going to be hard for Blitzer to take.  Poor thing.
@cnnbrk Jason come home.
@cnnbrk   ABOUT TIME FOR THE RELEASE!!!!!!!
@cnnbrk cant believe everyone is so blind to the actual facts
@cnnbrk I hope all of you delusioned libs are ready for more westerners to be taken prisoners for use in future deals.
@cnnbrk Thanks for calling it a swap. MSNBC is calling it a "release". This overshadows the $150 billion gift to Iran.
@cnnbrk This is crazy!  A marine who is Mozlem.  Why are we letting them into our military???
@cnnbrk @CNN I hope Rezaian soon  reunites with his brilliant, beautiful wife and relocates to the US before more false charges are brought
@phillips_mack Need PC /IT help for 5$? Check this guy

@cnnbrk wow, you people rejoicing make me sick. We now negotiate for criminals with enemies of the US just so admin can "look good"
@CandyStiltz @cnnbrk @CNN Because John Kerry is a wuss in deals. All our prisoners should be free...we set free 'terrorists'. Sigh. SMH
@cnnbrk
@cnnbrk @CNN We give them billions and criminals and they give us innocent hostages.
@cnnbrk A new page has opened up for Iran. Moderates in Iran have won.
@cnnbrk 
#Iran 
Iran spends 70% of its budget to export & impose Faqih way of live and teachings which distroy Lebanon, Syria,Iraq and Yemen
@cnnbrk common sense the Obama government isn't going to brag of trying to release prisoners. Just doing it Republicans negative and drama
