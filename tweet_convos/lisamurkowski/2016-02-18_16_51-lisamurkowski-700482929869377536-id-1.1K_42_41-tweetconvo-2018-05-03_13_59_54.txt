@lisamurkowski @mikedebonis What a joke. There is no such precedent. This is Orwellian doublespeak.
@timgibson @lisamurkowski @mikedebonis 
80 years of precedent. No other reasonable option. No hearings, no vote, no Obama appointee.
@AndyOplas @timgibson @lisamurkowski @mikedebonis "Precedent" means it happened before. What president leave Sup. Ct. seat empty for a year?
@spiderstumbled It has happened many times in American history. We've had 7, 8, and 9-member Supreme Courts. And they functioned fine.
@AndyOplas When was the last time that the Supreme Court had <9 justices for over a year?
@spiderstumbled Well, there was an 8-month vacancy 1987-88. Longer than a year was probably early 20th Century.
@AndyOplas waited a year to appoint a Sup. Ct. justice. Never. George Washington himself got 2 in his 8th year in office. (2/2)
@spiderstumbled  The President is welcome to nominate - Senate has the option of acting or not.
@lisamurkowski OK, if this is a tradition, what is ANY example of it occurring before?
@BronzeRoyce @JamesFallows @lisamurkowski But something that hasn't happened since pre-Civil War is still a tradition? Slavery a tradition?
@BronzeRoyce @JamesFallows @lisamurkowski post hoc ergo propter hoc?
@BronzeRoyce @JamesFallows @lisamurkowski Pre-2009 no African American president is historical precedent? If so, is it therefore tradition?
@lisamurkowski 

President Obama was elected for two full terms.  Your duty as outlined in the Constitution is to hold hearings and vote.
.@lisamurkowski Ma'am. This has never happened. I get why you want it to happen now, but I'm a historian. You need to stop claiming this.
@lisamurkowski Since you're up for reelection, please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice. #DoYourJob
@lisamurkowski what happens if the Court is needed to decide the election like in 2000?
@lisamurkowski Can you name just one time that has ever happened?
.@lisamurkowski The Constitution is the law of the land. We are (or were) a society that is ruled by law, *NOT* by partisan talking points.
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition.  You literally could not point to one example of a President not nominating 4 an open USSC seat.
.@lisamurkowski Partisan politics gets you NOTHING. You *know* you will be primaried. It would be only moderates who could save you (AGAIN).
@lisamurkowski And i urge him to forget your lies and red neck bull shit and make his appointment as stated in the Constitution
@lisamurkowski total bullshit. the american people aren't stupid.
@lisamurkowski, do your duty to support our president in appointing a new Supreme Court justice. One disappointed voter here in Ketchikan.
@lisamurkowski #doyourjob you applied for this post, you were hired for this post, and now you refuse to do the job? Embarrassing.
@lisamurkowski Damn lie. He's still POTUS. Don't like it? Stop fucking around and nominate a real candidate for once! #DoYourJob
@lisamurkowski This "tradition, embraced by both parties to allow the President's successor to select the next SC justice" doesn't exist.
@lisamurkowski  as an independent Alaskan, who helped save your political career...enough of this flip flopping. Do the right thing.
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition and you know it. Party hack.
@lisamurkowski is on a hot tin roof: There ain't nothin' more powerful than the odor of mendacity. You can smell it. It smells like death.
@lisamurkowski Really?  I voted for him in 2012 so that he'd be able to make this replacement!  The people spoke - now do your job! #POTUS
.@lisamurkowski There is no tradition. Stop lying. This has not happened before - Regan appointed Kennedy in his last year FEB 1988. TRUTH
@lisamurkowski Stay strong and stand in defense of our Constitution!  Do not confirm any SCOTUS nominee put forth by President Obama!
@lisamurkowski There is no such "tradition" and you are a liar.
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition and you know it.
@lisamurkowski and I urge you to ponder the odds of President Obama desperately wanting to make Republicans happy 
#LessThanZero
@lisamurkowski
Please, get rid of your brain freeze! There's no legal reason to withhold appointment!
@lisamurkowski I used to have so much respect for you now I'm not so sure. You're not any different than Mitch McConnell and his GOP goons.
@lisamurkowski Don't be Mitch's hostage. Be brave. Get some cajones.
@lisamurkowski Besides, Pres. Obama isn't going to go too liberal.  He'll pick a moderate that will make both sides grouse.  Do your job!
@lisamurkowski Are you genuinely mistaken or lying to us?  Reagan nominated a justice his last year & no one fought him.  If the Dems win...
@lisamurkowski you should be ashamed of yourself asking POTUS to shirk his responsibility for the "next" person to do. Is that what you do?
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition, that's GOP b.s. as usual. Voters spoke in 2012 for FOUR YEARS, PBO is in office until 1/20/17!
@lisamurkowski why, Lisa, why? You are tearing me apart, Lisa!
@lisamurkowski  When did that happen before?  You're making stuff up.
@lisamurkowski  Here's your precedent, Senator.  There is nothing magical about an election year.  http://www.vox.com/2016/2/13/10987692/14-supreme-court-confirmations …
@lisamurkowski what tradition?  I thought wrongly that you were one of the sane. It's all partisanship with you guys.#congressisbroken.
@lisamurkowski Senators= DO THEIR JOB & confirm Pres. Obama's nominee=just like 1988=vote 97-0 for Kennedy=ALL DEMS VOTED Y during REAGAN
@lisamurkowski Bullshit. There is no tradition. Last time this happened=1988 & REAGAN appt. Jus. Kennedy. Pres. Obama has Const. obligation
@lisamurkowski Tradition? I think not.You're playing fast and loose with words.
@lisamurkowski Looks like @SarahPalinUSA isn't the only Alaska Dingbat making things up. You make yourself look an even bigger fool, Lisa.
@lisamurkowski what fucking tradition?  He's obligated to nominate someone, you twunt.
@lisamurkowski sorry u decided to stoop to the untruths told by your party. There is no tradition- POTUS was elected to 8 yrs, not 7 .
@lisamurkowski this is a blatant lie and you should be ashamed of yourself.
@lisamurkowski I'm one of your constituents. This "tradition" is nonexistent. Please do your job.
@lisamurkowski So we elected you to A) Follow some unheard of tradition.  B) Support and Defend the US Constitution? Do your job Lisa!!!
@lisamurkowski the replies to your tweet ensure that I retain my faith in humanity, even when your tweet made me start to lose it.
@lisamurkowski That our elected leaders are so openly willing to lie is disheartening in the extreme.
.@lisamurkowski, tradition? Justice Kennedy was appointed by Reagan in his last few mths in office! Obama has 300+ days to go. #OBSTRUCTION
@lisamurkowski  Pres @obama should follow St. Ronnie's tradition and select a successor now.
@lisamurkowski Huh?!
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition. You and your party are not doing the GOP any favors by lying constantly about any and everything
@lisamurkowski First we have dumbass Palin making Alaska a global laughing stock and you turn around and start talking like a crack head.
@lisamurkowski No such tradition exists - ask Justice Kennedy. Do homework before spouting partisan lies! @KatieAnnieOakly @politicalgates
@lisamurkowski Maybe Congress should have embraced tradition & tried to actually pass common sense laws instead of being obstructionists.
@lisamurkowski interesting... Ronald Reagan chose a Supreme Court justice in his last year of presidency..
@lisamurkowski You are wrong.  I want SCOTUS to function during the next 18 months.  Why don't you?
@lisamurkowski <------- should be embarrassed if she actually said that.
@lisamurkowski stop lying to your constituents. There is no such "tradition"
You're so uninformed.  How did you get elected?  @lisamurkowski #sadforalaska
@lisamurkowski Have you made up any other traditions today?
@lisamurkowski There is no such "tradition" and you know it. You are so terrified of the Tea Klux Klan, you bow and scrape and lie for them,
Are we sure @lisamurkowski hasn't been replaced by @kanyewest because she's exhibiting the same type of twitter behavior.
@lisamurkowski even John Marshall Chief Justice was appointed in the final days of the Adams administration
@lisamurkowski  Please stop relying on Steve Harvey for your political history.
@lisamurkowski Eisenhower made a recess appointment in '56. Can Obama be like Ike? You offer no facts on your tweets Senator.
@lisamurkowski That is the most ridiculous statement. It’s pure ignorance.
@lisamurkowski By tradition I guess you mean all those election years when no Justice died or retired.
.@lisamurkowski this is a lie. 300 days left on his presidency. We had an election in 2012, Obama won in a landslide. Do your job.
@lisamurkowski So 3/5ths of a term for 3/5ths of a man? Your South is showing.
@lisamurkowski When did that "tradition" begin?  2016?
@lisamurkowski give us one example of this so-called "tradition" or do your job
@lisamurkowski there is no such tradition, is the problem. You are making it up.
@lisamurkowski GOP obstructionists demand the longest unfilled #SCOTUS seat since the Civil War. Because they want another one.
@lisamurkowski Stop lying to yourself and your constituents. You want a black President's term to be worth 3/5 of a white President's term.
@lisamurkowski I urge Senators to do their job and let the President do his - appoint a #SCOTUS justice.
@lisamurkowski The Constitution is clear:  It is the Pres's Art2 duty to nominate and the it is the Senate's role to "advise and consent."
@lisamurkowski Congrats. Joke of the day. The deadpan delivery sells it.
@lisamurkowski There is no "tradition."  This is just unvarnished bullshit.
@lisamurkowski 

Your racist dog whistle is making everyone in America deaf.
@lisamurkowski 

Got any examples? 
Or are you just talking about black Presidents?
@lisamurkowski How about we just follow the constitution?  Or can you see Russia from your window too?
@lisamurkowski There is no tradition you ponce.  At least not one anybody who doesn't believe in unicorns and fairies knows of.
@lisamurkowski What precedent?
@lisamurkowski You lie - there is no such tradition.  Credibility is hard earned and easily lost.  You just lost yours.
@BillAdkinsKY @lisamurkowski that happend in 2007. When Obama attempted to filibuster Alito. Schumer ran his mouth. 0 credibility is yours
@disturbedsauce you are #disturbed if you think Schumer's statements = #tradition - btw, there was no vacancy then @lisamurkowski
@BillAdkinsKY @lisamurkowski There has been no vacancy, nomination, and subsequent confirmation in an election year in 84 years.
@disturbedsauce Not because of any #tradition unless not dying or retiring in an election year is such #callingbullshiton @lisamurkowski
@BillAdkinsKY @lisamurkowski Your being pedantic O already ack he should not have done the things he did during Alitos #filibustered /1
@disturbedsauce you're asking me to suspend reason and logic for squat -and a #filibuster means what? Brandeis took 125 days @lisamurkowski
@BillAdkinsKY @lisamurkowski Its okay for libs to obstruct but if cons do it, the sky has fallen, and we are without reason? Hyperbole much?
@lisamurkowski I urge President Obama to follow example of President Reagan and appoint SC justice during 4th year of term.
@lisamurkowski ...our plan is working...MWAHAHAHA! #riseofthepuppets #rubes
@lisamurkowski There has never been such a tradition in all of American History.
@lisamurkowski That's false and you know it. Have you no integrity?
@lisamurkowski she's supposed to be one of the moderates too.
@lisamurkowski You're not allowed to make up traditions. You're not allowed to ignore the Constitution, either. #SCOTUS
@lisamurkowski There is NO SUCH PRECEDENT. You are LIAR and you know it.
You mean the history of there never being a black guy in the White House before @lisamurkowski dont use bullshit history for your racism
@lisamurkowski the only tradition being followed here is the grand tradition of GOP treating POTUS and the voters like crap since 2008
.@lisamurkowski Senator Murkowski, I respectfully request to see the evidence supporting this claim. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/feb/17/misleading-notion-supreme-court-vacancy-hasnt-been/ …
@lisamurkowski What tradition are you talking about?  What are you and your party smoking?
@lisamurkowski Stop lying. You know there is no such "tradition".
@lisamurkowski Why do Republicans hate America?
@lisamurkowski Another  Republican who has decided to throw the Constitution out the windows.
@lisamurkowski how can you possibly look at yourself in the mirror after such a blatant lie!
@lisamurkowski must hurt to lie like this.
@lisamurkowski HORSESHIT
@lisamurkowski I'm not sure you know the meaning of that word.
@lisamurkowski NOT a tradition, pure fantasy! it's President's job to nominate, YOUR job - to vote on it #SCOTUS #DoYourJob
@lisamurkowski Tradition? Since when!?
@lisamurkowski The ease with which you're lying here is extraordinary - you have a real skill when it comes to mendacity.
@lisamurkowski Your party will pay dearly for this BS. Millions of Americans still love @POTUS
@lisamurkowski you must be smoking crack as well as drunk on moonshine. Have you ever even *read* the Constitution? I bet not
@lisamurkowski you're lying. Not a Tradition. no President ever wasted that opportunity. Be honest!
@lisamurkowski I urge the Senate to follow the real tradition and hold a vote on the President's nominee in 90-120 days
@lisamurkowski 
There is no such tradition and you know it. It is sad that you are what passes for a moderate in today's Republican Party.
@lisamurkowski There is no tradition at all.  Why are you lying to everyone?  Who replaced you with this robot?
@lisamurkowski BS. Follow the #Constitution. You've heard of it, I'm sure. You pledged to uphold it, recall?
@lisamurkowski yeah, let's just ignore the Constitution!
@lisamurkowski just like the #GOP in congress has deferred any work to your successors?
@lisamurkowski no such precedent.
@lisamurkowski Reagan appointed Kennedy in the last year of his administration - that's the tradition.
@lisamurkowski Yeah, what sort of President would select a Supreme Court Justice in an election year?
@lisamurkowski not till 20th July, La Capitana Procrastinatatrix...
.@lisamurkowski Who told you this? It is a straight up lie. Why is the #GOP so determined to do nothing? Shame on you! #SCOTUS
@lisamurkowski Delete your account? Or resign from the Senate? Your state needs a Senator more closely in tune with reality.
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition. Certainly nothing "embraced by both parties". #doyourdamnjob
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition and  you know it. That's very dishonest of you.
@lisamurkowski You're better than this.  You know there's no "tradition"
@lisamurkowski nah
@lisamurkowski - You are peddling a blatant lie. Do you also think Obama is only 3/5 a president?
@lisamurkowski No.
@lisamurkowski  This simply isn't true and you know it. Embarrassing.
@lisamurkowski If there is a God, you will be in big trouble. Repent Liar!
@lisamurkowski Citation, please.
@lisamurkowski not sure you're entirely sober while tweeting this. Sit one round out champ
@lisamurkowski When did your "tradition" begin? 1989? Cause I have sweaters older than your tradition.
@lisamurkowski There is no such tradition, and saying that there is, either makes you uninformed, or a liar.
@lisamurkowski give us the history on this one
@lisamurkowski your constituents aren't as dumb as you seem to think they are
@lisamurkowski Here's another tradition: GOP senators spouting craven nonsense. Lotta precedent for that.
@lisamurkowski explain to me how "don't do your job for a year" is ok on any planet, I any job.
@lisamurkowski Chief Justice John Marshall was appointed in an identical situation, so I don't know what "tradition" you're referring to.
@lisamurkowski is that from the Confederacy tradition of treason?
@lisamurkowski Do your job, POTUS is doing his.
@lisamurkowski Imagine if your "tradition" really existed. No Cardozo. No Brandeis. Do you even know who they are? #GOPSupremeCourtShutdown
@lisamurkowski Please respond to this chart and explain where you get your "tradition"? #GOPSupremeCourtShutdown
@lisamurkowski 
You're as informed as Sarah Palin. What a disappointment. #partisanbullshit
@MrPhilLeeds @lisamurkowski 
Unlike the conservative activist judges chewing on edges of Roe and advocating voter suppression laws?
@lisamurkowski Facts are a dangerous thing? #GOPSupremeCourtShutdown
@lisamurkowski I guess it's easier to be a "conservative" when you get to just make up so-called "traditions" to justify your position.
@lisamurkowski as an #alaskan voter this is a #disappointing stance for you to take
@lisamurkowski Tradition? Look at all of the #SCOTUS nominations in an election year. #GOPSupremeCourtShutdown
@lisamurkowski Senator Murkowski, this "tradition" of yours is a lie. Your statement on this issue leaves you with zero credibility. #SCOTUS
@lisamurkowski This completely inaccurate Senator. A retraction would be appropriate.
@lisamurkowski Seems you believe what you want to believe regardless of facts + @POTUS relinguishes his office Jan. 20.  Deal with it.
@lisamurkowski and now senators are straight-up making stories up? Give one example of this "tradition". You should be fined for lying.
@lisamurkowski This is, of course, ca-ca of the highest order. #SCOTUS
@lisamurkowski What tradition would that be? No such thing. #PBO has over 300 days left in office.
@lisamurkowski kind of like Reagan's tradition waaay back in '87?
@lisamurkowski Do you plan to "follow a tradition" and defer any votes for the remainder of your term to YOUR successor? #DoYourJob
@lisamurkowski Which "tradition" would that be? Other than the recent Republican tradition of making up counterfactual stuff?
@lisamurkowski This one's just funny. There's no such tradition, except in the sense that something that happens rarely is "tradition".
@lisamurkowski you might as well ask the President to honor the tradition of Haley's Comet coming only once every 76 years.
@lisamurkowski And even then, you'd have to explain the three times in the last century that appointments did happen in election years.
@lisamurkowski but please, go ahead and be yourself here. This is Twitter, after all. It's why we're all here.
@lisamurkowski I'll translate: we dont want a liberal to pick the next justice so pretend its tradition that last yr of potus cant nominate.
@lisamurkowski read some history and the Constitution you dolt
@lisamurkowski This must be an embarrassment for you. Either you are terrifically misinformed or you have deliberately spread a falsehood.
@lisamurkowski what precedent, you idiot??  Seriously. Please identify the precedent. Read the fucking constitution.
@lisamurkowski I urge you to do your job, and let the President do his.
@lisamurkowski This would not be the first time that a President nominated someone during the last year of his term.
@lisamurkowski  I am aware of all internets traditions and this is not one.
@lisamurkowski 1912 - Pitney, 1916 - Brandeis & Clarke, 1932 - Cardozo, 1940 - Murphy, 1988 - Kennedy all prove your "tradition" is a lie
@lisamurkowski @WillMcAvoyACN I urge Sen. Murkowski to follow a tradition embraced by only one party and adhere to a fact every now and then
@lisamurkowski This is exactly the kind of politically motivated duplicity that gave birth to Trump.  Have you no shame Murkowski?
@lisamurkowski wow. You truly insult the nation's intelligence with a statement that ignores history, the Constitution, and your oath.
@lisamurkowski   Oh, good lord, she's crazy too.
@lisamurkowski a tradition? Why, because U.S. Presidents find themselves in this situation SO OFTEN? 
@lisamurkowski Oh, Lisa, that's a damn lie, and we all know it. Why do you do this, and make yourself look ... ridiculous?
@lisamurkowski http://bit.ly/1PMqTkp 
@lisamurkowski hell nah The people don't want to wait almost a year! You're telling a lie! That's not a tradition
@lisamurkowski It is not a tradition, you know it is not a tradition, and that means that you are peddling a lie
@lisamurkowski I urge you to learn the history of the country you represent. Since 1900 5 vacancies have arisen in final year, all got votes
@lisamurkowski Senator, you realize that NOBODY in America believes this has anything to do with "traditions", right?
@lisamurkowski This is actually not a tradition. Do Republicans know how to do anything but lie?
@lisamurkowski Simply put, bullshit.
@lisamurkowski idiotic lie.  Disgusting.
@lisamurkowski  is this the well known tradition of blacks not being given the same respect as whites? That tradition? Shame on you.
