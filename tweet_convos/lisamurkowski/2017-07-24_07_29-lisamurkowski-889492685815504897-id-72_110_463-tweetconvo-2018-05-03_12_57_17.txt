Ohhhh , go to the bridge beauty boy xox
The life and health of this cat was a priority to @lisamurkowski …
Repealing O'Care to start helping the rest of the country, not so much…
This cat was more productive in his role...then you are in yours....sad state of affairs...isn't it?
Nice you are worried about a goddamn cat while we have to pay $10,000 deductible on Healthcare
What about those who would lose access under Senate repeal bill? #VoteNo
Are you going to send condolences to the 62,000 Alaskans who will lose healthcare if you do not VOTE NO tomorrow? RIP Stubbs.
Sen Murkowski, condolences for the cat. Please also realize that the lives of many of your constituents are on the line!  #historyiswatching
Condolences to all older Alaskans and their cats if the health disaster bill moves forward. AK gets some of worse impacts in US. #VoteNoMTP
Call Sen. Murkowski TODAY! Tell her protect Alaska's Medicaid. No Pre-Ex punishments. No lifetime caps. #VoteNoMTP 907-271-3735
RIP Talkeetna's little ambassador kitty 
My condolences to your political career. We will not forget what you did today.
Compassion 4 CAT was heartfelt. Please vote NO + SHARE SAME compassion for MILLIONS of Americans that will LOSE their HCare.

Kudos to who ever took care of this cat. Mine usually get to age 18, so 20 is amazing!
THANK YOU for standing up for Americans today.
AARP strongly urges you to VOTE NO on motion to proceed for repeal/delay, AHCA, and BRCA.

Aarp is a political hack demicrat fraud group
sorry to hear this news. Happy times to Stubbs across the rainbow  bridge
Probably was on the failed obamacare.
Don't let #MrStubbs down, vote YES on MTP, let the floor discuss healthcare!! Your constituency needs you! My premiums increased 245%!
We need more compassionate representatives like you in DC.
Oh no! I love Mayor Stubbs.
Yet you support Zinke's #wildHORSEs slaughter...Beef industry owns #BLM despicable #horses MURDERS this ain't Christian END #HORSEslaughter
@ktva  I know that cat was a better mayor than Trump will ever be as President. STAY STRONG! Don't let that JA bully U 
The feline must have had Obamacare. The same happens 2 ppl who hav Obamacare. Where's ur condolences 2 millions of Americans 4 betraying us?

President @realDonaldTrump & every @SenateGOP member need to read this 10-yr-old boy’s letter before they repeal his mom’s healthcare today. 
Thank you, Sen, for previous statements about the vital importance of Planned Parenthood & Medicaid. Pls Vote NO today & pursue reg order
You also lost Bob Harte.  A poet; a legend.

Wow. Catholic nuns: this is the "most harmful legislation for American families in our lifetimes"; it is "simply immoral" and not pro-life. 
R.I.P. Mayor Stubbs
But, she has 8 more lives!
Lisa, Stubbs had to hold fund raisers for his multiple hospitalizations. That's not an option for most of us who need health care. Vote no

Wow. Catholic nuns: this is the "most harmful legislation for American families in our lifetimes"; it is "simply immoral" and not pro-life. 
Will you send my family condolences after TrumpCare cuts me off from care? Empty words can't replace a wife & mother. #KillTheBill

Wow....good long life for a cat. The rest of us would like that chance too.  Vote no on this messy healthcare effort by GOP.
I love cats. Have 2. Now how bout some compassion for the American people, Lisa? 

#NoTrumpCare
It's as simple as this.  #DoYourJob
Tomorrow we are being asked to choose between Donald Trump and our constituents. It is that simple.
Also, condolences to rural hospitals if the healthcare trainwreck moves forward. Call TODAY. #VoteNoMTP 907-271-3735
PLEASE VOTE NO TO PROCEED!!! MY SENATOR DOES NOT CARE ABOUT OUR HEALTHCARE!!!!
Step down. Run 4 office as the Dem u are!
What a beautiful cat!  RIP
RIP. Now we do t want that to happen to millions becuz they will be uninsured. Please do the right thing for the people. CBO score proves it
Let's be real - PEOPLE WILL DIE if safety nets are removed, bankruptcies  will sky rocket, and rural communities will be hit hard.  VOTE NO!
The cat was cute and I'm sad he passed away.  But we'd rather know where you stand on #Trumpcare.
AMA has reiterated stance against repeal and replace plans. You should have letter issued to Senate.
A vote of "yes" means that you declare MILLIONS of Americans as COLLATERAL DAMAGE for a meaningless "win." STAND W/ US! VOTE NO!
Just a reminder - MILLIONS of Americans are counting on YOU to make their lives better, not worse.  VOTE NO on this awful bill.
Please @lisamurkowski Please vote no and work on bipartisan solution. We are exhausted from being frightened. It's not hyperbole - it kills
Maybe you can #SaveOurCare and save some human lives?

This is what Lisa Murkowski told me in March about AHCA: 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do.

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR

4- Take Alaska. @lisamurkowski, when GOP leaders told you that the ACA was broken, did they tell you they would massively  ppl's costs? 
He's been through so much, yet lived to 20! A remarkable kitty, so loved by his community. RIP, Mayor Stubbs.

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
I BET THAT CAT IS SMARTER THAN DJT
