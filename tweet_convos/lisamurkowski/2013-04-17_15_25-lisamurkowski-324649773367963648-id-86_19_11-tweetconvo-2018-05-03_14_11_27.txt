.@lisamurkowski registering to vote, drive, fish, run childcare, or immigrate doesn't compromise freedom, but #gun registry does? #STUPID

@lisamurkowski weak cowardly rubbish. Remember at the next massacre that you have blood on your hands
@lisamurkowski Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski How does a coward like you sleep at night? I'm a life long gun owner and no one wants to take away my rights! Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski shame on you.
@lisamurkowski I find this remark pandering for votes from NRA dupes. Shame on you. You and your cohorts = embarrassment to our nation.
@theonlyadult  @SinCityCarol @DrRik Evoking her own interpretation of 2ndA @lisamurkowski has no use for GOD's words Matt 5 & Exodus 20:13!
@lisamurkowski You are a disgrace to the office you hold and to the First Nation people you represent. 2nd Amend. rights. Ha! That's idiotic
@lisamurkowski Lisa, background checks do not compromise 2nd Amdnt rights and you know it. You lie to cover for the #NRA. You shame Alaska.
@lisamurkowski 2nd amendment crap - you do a nice job spewing the venom of the gun lobby - shame on you for making a sham of our system
@lisamurkowski I would like to think of you having to explain that to the victims of gun violence. Disgraceful.
@lisamurkowski Spoken like a true #seNRAtor
@lisamurkowski blood on your hands.A background check doesn't compromise anyone's rights and you know it! shame, shame, shame! never forget
Thank you @lisamurkowski !  You did the right thing.  Ignore the haters.
#2A
@lisamurkowski  2nd ammendmend has nothing to do with background checks & assault weapons. how would u vote if your child was killed by one
@lisamurkowski Shame for your vote on background checks. The 90% are watching!
@lisamurkowski So disappointed! Our children are watching & learning that the NRA matters more to you than their safety. #2ndAmendment
@lisamurkowski you were elected by a democratic process, yet you failed to support that process in allowing a vote. You are a disgrace
.@lisamurkowski there was no compromise to second amendment rights.dont condescend.all credibility, all moral authority u may hv had is gone
@lisamurkowski You should be ashamed of your vote in the Senate yesterday. More people will die from gun violence because of you.
@lisamurkowski if 20 dead 6 year olds doesn't make you do the right thing, then I have no use for you. SHAME ON YOU.
@lisamurkowski the 2nd amedment has nothing 2 do with background checks Stop trying 2 lead the people astray your vote will cost u your job
@lisamurkowski there is no compromise of the 2 amndmnt madam misdirectn shld not B an senators' way of communicating wth a nation #msnbc2013
@lisamurkowski just compromise the life of innocents. What a disgrace, Americans need to regroup and reassess priorities
@lisamurkowski Do you actually read the bills, or do you just call up the NRA and ask them how you should vote?
@lisamurkowski I will financially support the next person to run against you. Hope you feel the same if it's every your family.
@lisamurkowski You are a total disgrace to America. May your "vote" haunt you forever
@lisamurkowski May the God of cruel and unusual butt fucking have mercy on your putrid soul.
@lisamurkowski shame on u4 voting no! Enjoy blood of innocent people on your hands! #MomsDemandAction #GunSense http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html?_r=0 …
@lisamurkowski Of course you have to restrict gun ownership to make us safer. You had the chance to do so and you failed us. How shameful.
@lisamurkowski The bills today did not threaten the 2nd Amendment. Lying NRA puppets.
.@lisamurkowski That's really weak. Background checks don't stop law-abiding citizens from acquiring guns, and you know it. #NRAlapdog
@lisamurkowski Shut up! You betrayed the American people and all those DEAD NEWTOWN CHILDREN! #SHAMEONYOU #Coward
@lisamurkowski Ensuring that criminals can't simply buy a gun online or thgrough a classified ad is not a compromise of the 2nd amendment.
Shame on you @lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski Hang your head in shame because your callous actions will result in more innocent children being senselessly gunned down.
@lisamurkowski Children will die, I hope you can sleep. Your vote was cowardly and whatever your reason for voting to kill the bill is a lie
@lisamurkowski Re: No vote on extended  BG checks. You just spit on 90% of America.
@lisamurkowski You have failed the American people and your electorate. Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski Ms. Murkowski you are my senator.  Reasons just like this is why I voted for you.  You understand Alaskans.
@lisamurkowski Please don't embarrass yourself with lame excuses. This isn't about the 2nd amendment but about what a coward you are.
@lisamurkowski As if an expanded background check would somehow infringe upon your right to buy a gun if you are a law abiding citizen!
@lisamurkowski No, we'll just compromise our children's right to safety instead.
@lisamurkowski complete fabrication. shame on you
@lisamurkowski Guns have changed since the 2nd amendment was written. It's time to change the laws accordingly.
@lisamurkowski  Lisa say what you want but you have the blood of so many people on your hands who havn't even died yet.  #Gunsmoke
@lisamurkowski You already have a well trained and armed militia in the National Guard. Surely even you can see this complies with 2nd.
@lisamurkowski If you read 2nd amendment correctly, a well trained Militia sounds to me like the National Guard. You don’t need more guns.
@lisamurkowski Yes, Alaska.  You have your finger on the pulse of America.  You failed.  You will not be re-elected.
@lisamurkowski "You voted to continue putting innocent lives at risk in order to appease the NRA lobby." #newtownbetrayed
@lisamurkowski shame on you.  #votethemout
@lisamurkowski what about MY rights to be safe in a movie theater, in a school, in a mall, in a restaurant , etc. etc. ?
#newtownbetrayed
. @lisamurkowski Basically you're saying that you love your guns, which wouldn't have been impacted by this law, more than our children
@lisamurkowski Background checks are NOT an infringement. I have to get a background check to get certain jobs, but not to buy a gun?!
.@lisamurkowski That NRA money is the only thing you are representing. How many dead kids will it take?
@lisamurkowski if bgcks didn't violate Constitution before then expanding them to include gun shows won't either. It's really pretty simple
@lisamurkowski what do back round checks have to do with the 2nd amendment? Law abiding citizens shouldn't fear a back round check.
@lisamurkowski Ridiculous! This is a ridiculous stance and America knows it.
@lisamurkowski The bill didn't threaten 2A rights, and I expect u know that. Stop the gun demagoguery #gundemagogues
@lisamurkowski BULLSHIT. Complete and utter bullshit. The second ammendment says explicitly "well regulated." 

Registered IS regulated.
@lisamurkowski u clearly did not read the bill.  The Lord sees all.
@lisamurkowski It did not compromise 2nd Amendment rights.  You would rather a child die then a gun owner have a background check.
@lisamurkowski There was no threat to #2A, just to school children and woman in abusing relationships, and you sided with the felons.
@lisamurkowski Huge failure on your part. Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski  A constitutional scholar you are not.
@lisamurkowski Are you afraid of the "government" (which is YOU, btw) coming to take your car? It's registered.
@lisamurkowski  - Absolutely right! And no, the background checks do not need to be tweaked. Our 2nd Amend rights are already clear!
@lisamurkowski Madam Senator, please spare us this NRA-funded tweet. Be a leader next time. For all our sakes.
@lisamurkowski ridiculous u want2tell me how background check on criminals tryN 2buy guns is infringing on 2nd amendment?U WILL B VOTED OUT.
@lisamurkowski Do you believe the 2nd Amendment means the right to bear ANY arms?
@lisamurkowski like what you voted against really did that - ate the #NRA jello again!
@crone728 @lisamurkowski those who voted against lied to constituents about what would happen re: gun rights.
@lisamurkowski You really are an asshole.
@snowcones @lisamurkowski just about covers it.....
@lisamurkowski we already have background checks Lisa. The bill only would have expanded the current system to online sales + gun shows.
