Please don't give in to the bribery.  Millions of vets, elderly, disabled, and children are counting on you, Senator.   Please vote no.
Please find it the strength in yourself to stand up to this latest, even crueller health care bill.
Please do not take the polar payoff! Vote no!
just say No to the Kodiak Kickback
Time will tell if Murkowski can be bought off by the Trump Crime Family. #Trumpcare
Vote No! Your constituents & your country are counting on you. Nobody wants you to vote yes. Read the replies and Vote No!
Don't cave to your party's dark side. You know it's bad for the country. Take high road and work with Dems to fix AHCA
Plz protect your constituents from #Trumpcare. 

@realDonaldTrump has filed 6 bankruptcies.  
He survived, but can they?

#VoteNo
Welcome MGen O'Neill! 
BTW - Murkowski is planning to vote for a healthcare bill that will hurt Alaskan children, elderly and the disabled

VOTE NO
.@lisamurkowski please tell McConnell you can't be bought! You'll be around longer than him!
Support our veterans and vote no and stealing their healthcare.
Please stay strong, unswayed and unpaid by McConnell and vote NO on this atrocious legislation.  #Trumpcarekills
Please think of all the people and don't take this bribe. Thank you, Senator.
#savemedicaid #voteno
Cool! Did you tell him you'd vote NO on #Trumpcare n Cruz Bill right? Cuz it guts Medicaid n Blue Cross says it's unworkable n no @PPact $?

If you buy a cheap plan, get sick, and your illness isn't covered, you're banned from buying a new plan for 6 months http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-bcra-20170714-story.html …
What do you have to say to this woman and her friend?
Cancer survivor shares with staffers of GOP Rep. Lamar Smith a powerful story about how Obamacare helped extend the life of a friend. 
Good you can appreciate a great service person. Please now speak out against your "president" re: banning transpeople from the military.
Tweets are worth more in the $=vote system. I'll join the othrs blowin up replies to TELL you to vote no on the repeal. Be a public servant.
It will be especially egregious if you justify the vote for 45 m on opiate spending, when the bill throws addicts of Medicaid en masse.
Can literally stop endless suffering & many deaths by just announcing (NOW!) that you will vote no, regardless of tweaks. People are scared
Vote No on motion to proceed on DeathCare bill. Killing hundreds of thousands of Americans by taking away their coverage is cruel & inhuman
Sens who are "bought off" in Trumpcare will only get IOUs they can't cash, pennies on the $ & problems they never understood.
Dead silence about the new death bill. I'm guessing the bribe deal was successful even though Medicaid will be gutted. Have fun in hell.
If you sell your vote for a few $$$ for Alaska, that equates to selling your soul to the Devil. Don't do it
Don't accept the Polar Payoff! The health care bill needs to benefit all Americans!
Please tell the American people you have not been bought off and will not vote to take away their healthcare.
Did you see the calculations for health insurance premiums for 60-64 year olds in Alaska under the Senate plan? Who can afford up to 20k/yr?
Benedict Arnold hailed from Connecticut but he betrayed the ENTIRE country. You are an Alaskan and about to do the same. VOTE NO #BCRA
The Klondike Kickback won't save AK from the pain of the @GOP #Medicaid raid. Call @lisamurkowski (202)-224-6665

Scandalous. I'm glad you care about "all" Americans.
Vote your good conscience Lisa and do what is right-vote NO on this healthcare bill!
Sorry for the hijack, but many are eagerly awaiting your response to this:
This is the DEATH SPIRAL that healthcare companies has labeled the deal killer in this disasterous bill. #SaveACA #DeathCareBill
No one on Earth should put 1/6 of the economy and 23 million lives or more in Tom Price's hands. #SaveACA #SaveMedicaid
Women need health!  Stop letting old white men tell women their lives do not matter!  #SaveACA
Are you saving Obamacare for senators and taking away Medicaid from Alaskans?

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
How many additional uninsured Americans is acceptable to your GOP colleagues? They will enjoy great health care but it sucks to be us.

Getting more analysis on Trumpcare revisions in Senate bill now.

Doing a press call & then will tweet what I've learned. 1
Good thread on the amended "healthplan".    Please don't vote on a bill without a CBO score and open discussion.
1. The Senate Trumpcare bill amendment was just released & it went from very bad to unworkably bad. First analysis.

https://draftable.com/compare/YQqISKezkQIt …
So like my @senrobportman you're avoiding the real issues. Curious about this blatant bribe? $1.8B from all to AK?
SHAME ON YOU FOR ACCEPTING SLUSH FUND $ TO VOTE YES ON HEALTHCARE BILL.  THAT'S ILLEGAL.

Reminder: Murkowski told me last month she didn't want a polar payoff, she wanted a plan that works for USA. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/gop-health-bill-steers-cash-to-home-state-of-reluctant-senator …
But, she's not come out publicly this week, has she? Have I missed that?
I think it's still up in the air.
That she did not come out against it immediately is Deeply Troubling.
Hi Senator. It is still a terrible bill overall even if it includes some Alaska specific provisions. Thanks
Can you believe how many of your party voted to gag the military from mentioning climate change? What does your new MGen think about that?
Hope the media reports are wrong about you. Pls vote NO on this horror. Health care professionals and insurers say it will be devastating.

Republicans use state payoffs to win votes for repeal bill http://politi.co/2t0C42V  

Here are the "moderate" GOP senators who could pull the plug on the health care bill http://huffp.st/gRUHq9T  

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
Senator Murkowski: Glad Mitch the Grinch who steals health care has found ways to win (buy) your vote.
vote NO!

I had faith in you as a fellow woman and as a quality human being with a sound moral compass.I truly hope the reports are wrong. Pls vote no
Please don't forget that the health care bill is still garbage. Will you publicly oppose it, please?
I'm so disappointed right now! I just read that you've succumbed to the bribery. I had so much faith in you to do the right thing. Vote no!
Where did you read it? I can't find that
Please do not sell out! No to #Trumpcare @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris
Please vote NO on health care bill. Keep us healthy.
and MANY military families will SUFFER if republicans pass their HEARTLESS healthcare bill..PLEASE VOTE NO. Thank you.
Brings back memories when I was with the 1/17th infantry in Alaska in the late 90s.  Summer were the best
You get 1.3 billion but then loose 3.1 billion in Medicaid by 2020 something. Math don't add up.
POLAR PAYOFF get bought off to help your state a little while the avalanche is coming down on those with pre-existing conditions.
Please vote no
Are you going to make sure ALL AMERICANS ARE COVERED? Cause that's what we all care about.
MY OWN INSURANCE COMPANY IS TELLING ME TO RESIST THE BILL!!!!!!!!!
Who would vote for something that literally the companies that do it say "hey this bill is shit"
Are you insane????
This is what the GOP wants!  Sick!  All to make the Sociopaths McConnell and Trump happy!
How come the GOP has to rush this health bill through in 2 weeks!?  The ACA was debated for almost a year!  Please vote no and save lives!!
Let me list doctors, hospitals, nurses, every health organizations, and now INSURANCE COMPANIES.
You are being bought off and you are sacrificing our healthcare instead of thinking what's best for Alaska  41.7%!!!!!!
Not only  Alaskans per se would lose, but: >>>
Plus you are gonna exempt yourself from this bill are you kidding me?
MILLIONS MORE UNINSURED AND YOU ARE GONNA BUY ALASKA FOR CHUMP CHANGE.
This is from a freakin insurance company BLUE CROSS *flips table*

How can they possible vote for this bill. This is madness. Even the insurance companies say it's nuts.
Because they're getting bought off
The insurance companies sent this about the bill
Nice message.  No do something substantial and vote AGAINST Trump care
USMA Class Pete Andrysiak...
Show that you don't just care about Alaska, but the entire country, by voting NO on deathcare!
Don't hurt Disabled on Medicaid barely getting by! Caps will kill people who get sick&those requiring lots of treatments like MikePhillips!
VOTE NO
This was done in secrecy, and rushed thru. No hearings. No input from docs/hospitals/etc. Even insurers are saying it's a train wreck
This bill is causing great angst - just ask doctors about their patients. It's why docs/nurses/citizens flock to D.C. now.  Please VOTE NO!
We treat our active Soldiers to great free health care. All people ask is to pay a fair price for theirs.

No on healthcare repeal bill.
Senator, it's VITAL to MILLIONS of Veterans & their families that you protect our healthcare. It's the most important thing we have. VOTE NO
