@lisamurkowski I certainly hope you will vote yes on the bill that the House is going to send over today. It's time to stand up to libs.
@lisamurkowski Vote NO for Cloture!
@lisamurkowski Say no! To Obamacare, don't cave to his dictatorship actions. He is not our king, even though he thinks he is. Impeach him!
@lisamurkowski Would be nice if ACA addressed patient care - and didn't force employers to cut hours. 40 hrs would add 10hrs of work for US
@lisamurkowski Thank u 4 ur outstanding work representing the majority of ur constituents as everyday Obamacare grows more & more unpopular.
@lisamurkowski and that is why I will not vote for you.
@lisamurkowski I could not be more disappointed in you.
@lisamurkowski Instead of explaining why ur NOW working 2 delay/dismantle & repeal Obamacare why not explain why u voted w/ Reid to pass it!
@lisamurkowski @BettyeBear  Did you know you have to  pay $500 deduc. to even get care for a damn sinus infection? No cloture
@ringod01 Feel your pain! Up all nite 2 see if my INS being pulled out my Cancer hospital as of 1-1-14. Sad days ahead 4 USA @lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski Say no! To Obamacare. don't cave to his dictator like actions. He is not our king, even though he thinks he is. Impeach him!
@lisamurkowski its established law & endorsed with only two 51%+ pop vote POTUS wins since Ike. You're needed elsewhere, let Obamacare stand
@lisamurkowski NO DELAY!  The President said NO NEGOTIATIONS! Are you freaking DEAF?
@lisamurkowski Your Party is a mess.
@lisamurkowski it's the law. Put it into action and suggest fixes from within. So many uninsured folks here in Ak.
.@lisamurkowski Lead by example not by fear. Obamacare is not ready & it's costing jobs. #DefundObamaCare #MakeDCListen #HarryReidsShutdown
@lisamurkowski Thank you Lisa.  Delaying the Obamacare bill is a sound approach.
@lisamurkowski why didn't you vote to defund it then???
@lisamurkowski Your vote for cloture on the house bill to defund obamacare was a vote to fund obamacare!
@lisamurkowski ALASKA need to vote you out. You had the chance to stop OBAMACARE and you decided to get into bed with REID.
@lisamurkowski #Shutdownquestions If the GOV shuts down will the FREE market still be open?
@lisamurkowski THANK YOU for the 1 year delay! It's not fair to allow others a delay/exemption & not American people.#MakeDCListen
