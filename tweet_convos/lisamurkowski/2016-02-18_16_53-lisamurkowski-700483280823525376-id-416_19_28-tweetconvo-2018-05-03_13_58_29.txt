@lisamurkowski another obstructionist to vote out. You're fired. We don't need any more people who won't do their jobs.
@lisamurkowski And your silence speaks volumes. The fact you cannot defend your position says it all and voters will see thru it in Nov.
@lisamurkowski Here's an ACTUAL Senate precedent: inviting the budget director to testify on POTUS budget. Where do you stand?
@lisamurkowski I love you Lisa and am disappointed by this stance. Obama was elected by the American people for four years.
@Rising @lisamurkowski You forget that #Congress & #SENATE went @GOP, Obama has no mandate! #Senate doesn't is NOT Required confirm anyone!
@ThomasSickler @lisamurkowski @GOP Senate needs to do their job. Period. Making up this precedent bs
@Rising NOTHING IN THEIR JOB SAYS THEY Need to  have HEARING OR VOTE! You want to look @HarryReid he Brought nothing to the senate floor.
@lisamurkowski DO YOUR FUCKING JOB
@lisamurkowski -Pr. Bush didn't follow ur so-called precedent.Kennedy was confirmed in 88.Const says the president-not the "next President".
@lisamurkowski This is not extraordinary circumstances. Numerous appointments have been in an election year. Stop making up nonsense.
@lisamurkowski There is a precedent. It's called Justice Anthony Kennedy 1988.
@lisamurkowski Opposing views are perfectly fine. But it's completely unacceptable and insulting to voters when you make something up.
@lisamurkowski If you make a bold statement without one evidence in support, then it means nothing. Please provide just ONE example.
.@lisamurkowski Are you a real Senator or do you just play one on twitter?
@AKMMitchell @JamieHarrisLeft @lisamurkowski "If POTUS ignores non-existent precedent..." THERE. Fixed it for her.
@crowguye @AKMMitchell @lisamurkowski Well done. I hope she sees that!
@JamieHarrisLeft @AKMMitchell @lisamurkowski If she does, she'll just block me. Republicans aren't interested in dialogue w/ the US public.
@crowguye @JamieHarrisLeft @AKMMitchell @lisamurkowski correction, establishment isn't interested in dialogue w/US public, just billionaires
@lisamurkowski So hear this and if you do deny the nomination, the Obama coalition will come out in droves to deny you control of the senate
@Mahogany1992 To vote for 2 whiteys #Hillary / #Sanders they didn't vote for 8yrs ago? They will just stay home instead.
@lisamurkowski Senator, please, this is dumb and needlessly obstructive. Vote yes or no, but vote on a nominee.
@lisamurkowski there is no precedent for punting on a year of the SCOTUS. The American people deserve to have their highest court working!
#NotTrue. Look up: "#UnsuccessfulNominations to the #SupremeCourt"..shows many Nominations that result in #NoAction @Phrozen_ @lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski Agree whole-heartedly. Also unnecessary to hold hearings, which only waste the Senate's time.
@AndyOplas @lisamurkowski what precedent? You are just a partisan hack.
@LesElkind Just expressing the opinion of half the country, and the Congressional governing majority who the people elected.
@AndyOplas @LesElkind so 46% is half country? Rounding up much? Or just trying to make certain President Obama is only 3/5ths a President?
@marckeepper  You're really grasping at straws now. Lol
@AndyOplas more & more agree about McConnell's obstructionism & pernicious othering: http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/revanche-and-the-first-black-president …
@lisamurkowski (or whatever aide wrote that).  Please, please just give ONE example of a prez not nominating for a vacant seat. JUST ONE!
@lisamurkowski what precedent?
@lisamurkowski Let @POTUS nominate: the #Senate it is completely within their purview to take up the nomination or not!! #VOTENO
@lisamurkowski Precedent? What precedent? You can't manipulate the constitution as you see fit. Eventually ppl will wake up to your hubris.
@lisamurkowski The electorate is much smarter than you think. Look at the fact that barely anyone is defending your Twitter statements.
.@lisamurkowski Go ahead. Make our day & risk losing lots of GOP seats in November! We only have to go back to 1988 to know NO precedent.
@lisamurkowski  The GOP has a majority in the Senate.  If you do not approve the nominee, you could vote him down. What's the problem?
@lisamurkowski Senator there is no such precedent.
No Senator. @lisamurkowski you have it backward. That would be the SENATE ignoring precedent, and ignoring its Constitutional role.
@lisamurkowski So you're a racist?
You're about as informed as Sarah Palin, @lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski The historical precedent is Reagan nominating Anthony Kennedy in his last MONTH in office & the prec IS that he was appointed
@lisamurkowski precedent? This had happened 8 times since 1900. As a US Senator you should at least have your facts straight! Shame on you
.@lisamurkowski you r lying. I used to respect you. What has GOP done to you? Press Reagan last year of office nominee. History, learn it.
@lisamurkowski the Senate is the one -- to the degree there is precedent -- ignoring the precedent of confirming final year nominees
@lisamurkowski There is no precedent, as has been pointed out by numerous historians and court observers. Be honest in your obstruction.
@lisamurkowski What precedent?  You can't just make this stuff up as you go along?
@lisamurkowski Didn’t you swear to uphold the Constitution? You take that so lightly? Wow SMDH
@lisamurkowski Any chance you could let us know when you'll be updating/correcting this series of tweets?
@lisamurkowski No historical basis for your opinion, Senator, and you know it. People aren't fooled.
@lisamurkowski the contempt you show for your constituents, the Constitution and basic truth is astounding
@lisamurkowski so you to leave a seat open for over a year! Have you read the constitution? Kennedy confirmed last yr of Reagan by Dem Sen
@lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski denying votes is the GOP tradition you've been referring to all along, amirite? #IOKIYAR #GOPFail
@lisamurkowski the "extraordinary circumstances being what exactly? A black President??
@lisamurkowski since precedent for you Rs is PRESIDENT Obama is only 3//5 of a person so he only gets 3/5 of a presidency, amirite?
@lisamurkowski You are being disingenuous. "Precedent" is that the president nominates, election year or no. You know this.
@lisamurkowski I believe extraordinary circumstances could lead your nose to grow a mile long.
.@lisamurkowski
.@lisamurkowski There is no precedent so stop spreading that lie. Do your job! @POTUS will fulfil his constitutional duty. Do yours. #SCOTUS
@lisamurkowski Of course Potus is going to nominate.
I would suggest keeping an open mind. 
Perhaps we will like this nominee.
@lisamurkowski Hope YOU don't ignore the law.
@lisamurkowski Lisa, you caved. As did my respect for you! This backtracking on the supreme court nominee. You of all people. SPINELESS.
@lisamurkowski and you're supposed to be one of the "sane" republicans... right?
@lisamurkowski It is his Constitutional duty to nominate a replacement. The irony here is that Scalia was a Constitutional originalist...
@lisamurkowski WHAT precedent? Anthony Kennedy confirmed Feb. 1988: election year. Scalia confirmed SEPT. 26 1986, only 5 weeks b4 election!
@lisamurkowski What precedent??????????? There hasn't been a single example of what you call a precedent. You're simply lying. You're a liar
@lisamurkowski Everyone sees through your ploy. THERE IS NO PRECEDENT. You should study some history 4 a change.
@lisamurkowski Let's look at precedent.  Oh, wait a minute, you are wrong. #GOPSupremeCourtShutdown
@lisamurkowski you are the one ignoring precedent. This obstruction is unconstitutional and wrong. All nominees deserve a vote.
@lisamurkowski Fire your intern and wonder if the people of Alaska are looking for your replacement if you continue the mess. #SCOTUS
@lisamurkowski    You have the precedent wrong. Sad that a legislator is so ignorant.
@lisamurkowski   Regan appointed in his final year of office...quit lying to the public. 
Shameful behavior
@lisamurkowski Making up shit as you go along, I see.
@lisamurkowski After Obama says "impeccable cred, 97-0," for months we'll enjoy when you repeat this meaningless & bogus talking point
@lisamurkowski again, no one outside of the GOP really believes this precedent exists. But, OK.
@lisamurkowski But again, consider the fact that you're using a lot of invented nonsense about tradition and precedent just to cover up...
@lisamurkowski the fact that you, and your party, are acting in a purely partisan fashion. Let me let you in on a little secret....
@lisamurkowski *whispers* We all know that this is how both parties behave when something like this happens. You don't have to do this.
@lisamurkowski It's 2016, and you are free to simply say "We don't want the President appointing anyone to Congress who might be left of...
@lisamurkowski ...Thomas. Or Roberts. Or Kennedy, even."
@lisamurkowski Even though we all know Obama's going to play nice and throw you all a completely inoffensive centrist....
@lisamurkowski so you can pretend to be upset for a few weeks and then finally have a hearing and a vote and confirm someone.
Senator @lisamurkowski, precedent is that POTUS nominates. Leaving the seat open would be violating precedent.
@lisamurkowski Really, Senator? Are these "extraordinary circumstances" in the Constitution? When in their terms must Senators stop voting?
@lisamurkowski Barak Obama is an extraordinary circumstance.  The Senate has a DUTY to stop this rogue president from appointing a radical
@lisamurkowski Again, it would be the Senate ignoring clear precedent (prev justices getting votes), not @POTUS, and abdicating their duty
@lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski He would ignore precedent by NOT naming a successor to Scalia!!
@lisamurkowski There... Is... No... Precedent!
@lisamurkowski it's amazing you don't have the sense to delete this dishonest series of tweets after being repeatedly called on your lie
@lisamurkowski (early) scalia would have been appalled at how repubs are lying about precedent and making up the law. #truth #broken
@lisamurkowski please delete your account lmao. The precedent is to nominate a candidate. His term lasts 4 years, not 3. Smh
@lisamurkowski Lying but IOKIYAR
.@lisamurkowski  I think one should look in the mirror and repeat "I will not lie" if one is a senator in the US Senate.
@lisamurkowski If only you bothered to do the smallest amount of research about which you spoke. Oh well.
@lisamurkowski What precedent? the one Regan set when he Nominated Justice Kennedy?
@lisamurkowski, how can @POTUS ignore precedent?! He is the precedent! Precedent Obama!
@lisamurkowski Do you even know what the Constitution says? POTUS has a DUTY to nominate and the Senate to advise and confirm! DO YOUR JOB!
@lisamurkowski would the senate ignoring precedent by refusing to do its job give the president the right to make a recess appointment?
@lisamurkowski Justice Kennedy was appointed by lame duck St. Ronald Reagan. There is no precedent. Do your job or resign.
@lisamurkowski The PRECEDENTS are Justices Brandeis, Clarke, Cardozo, Murphy, Stevens, and Kennedy, ALL nominated in "election years"
@lisamurkowski Okay, now you're just making stuff up.  That must be a tradition among Alaskan elected officials.
@lisamurkowski can you please explain this precedent you cite?
@lisamurkowski There. Is. No. Such. Precedent. President Obama is President.  There's only one President. It's his job to nominate.
@lisamurkowski There is no historical precedent.  Unless precedent = Repub Senators making things up. Obama should get > 3/5ths of his term!
@lisamurkowski There is no "tradition" or "precedent." That's complete bullshit. Why are you pandering to the GOP that abandoned you?
@lisamurkowski so you just make this up every day?
Because really, no one believes you.
@lisamurkowski ignoring your false precedent, where in the Constitution do you read this?
@lisamurkowski Can you please list all the times this has happened with over 6 months left in office?
@lisamurkowski Advise and consent has traditionally meant hold a hearing, grill the candidate and vote. That w’ld be the conservative view.
@lisamurkowski when did you realize you lost your integrity and when did you become ok with that?
@lisamurkowski do your job.
@lisamurkowski If the President refused to nominate, you'd move to impeach him. And rightly so. Sadly there is no equivalent for the Senate
.@lisamurkowski "I support an up-or-down vote on all noms brought 2 Senate floor, regardless of the president nominating them" - you, 2005.
@lisamurkowski Very disappointed you pander like this Lisa. The Constitution is explicitly clear on this. There is ZERO precedent here
@lisamurkowski I still see your not responding? You must be setting your own "precedent"?
There is no such precedent. If there were, you'd be able to tell us what it was and when it happened. @lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski So... name one time?
@lisamurkowski There is not only no tradition of this happening, there is no precedent, there is not a single time this has happened. Ever.
@lisamurkowski Not since Civil War has there been a year-long vacancy on Supreme Court. Are circumstances that extraordinary? (3/3)
@lisamurkowski Source: http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/ … (2/3)
@lisamurkowski There's no precedent. Every election-year vacancy in 20th C, POTUS nominated a successor. In 6 of 8, nominee confirmed. (1/3)
@lisamurkowski please detail the POTUS precedent of not nominating to SCOTUS during final year. Has it ever happened?
@lisamurkowski You might try lying about something that's not so easily disproved. Or is lying a badge of honor in the GOP?
@lisamurkowski Please stop. Just stop. Not only are you ignoring the Constitution, you're also making the Internet dumber.
@lisamurkowski Just admit you don't want to change the conservative majority on the court. Pretending otherwise insults us both.
@lisamurkowski you know what's extraordinary? Your willingness to accept 8 years of GOP obstruction as if it's normal. It's NOT & it's WRONG
@lisamurkowski is the person running your Twitter account currently high on drugs? I sure hope so. Would at least explain this insanity.
@lisamurkowski The People elected @potus for 4, not 3 years. @potus will honor Constitution & nominate successor. DO YOUR JOB & VOTE.
@lisamurkowski you and the rest of the GOP Hate America/ only worried about yourselves getting re-elected. LOSERS
@lisamurkowski The precedent is: the serving President nominates Supreme Court justices. Are you actively mendacious, or just stupid?
@lisamurkowski There is no precedent that says he should wait. Only the Constitution, which says the Pres shall nominate Justices. Remember?
@lisamurkowski AND, even Bork got an up-or-down vote
@lisamurkowski Obstruction should never become a time-honored tradition.
@lisamurkowski Kennedy was confirmed in 1988.
@lisamurkowski LBJ nominated Abe Fortas in 1968. You're party BLOCKED the vote
@lisamurkowski There is no precedent
@lisamurkowski GFY
@lisamurkowski Ironic to call for someone not to ignore precedent in a situation in which you are literally ignoring precedent
@lisamurkowski "I believe" is the key.   We follow the law, not our personal beliefs.
@lisamurkowski That is a false precedent. Get your campaign together.
@lisamurkowski Wow another Republican succumbs to the zombies. Sad. The president will do his duty. You-- not so much.
@lisamurkowski please show honor and admit you've been horribly misinformed
@lisamurkowski just because you ski doesn't mean you get to make up fictional stories about "precedent"
@lisamurkowski You had it right the first time. Your constituents and your Country deserve better. Shameful.
.@lisamurkowski You are lying. There is NO precedent/tradition. http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/ … You are trashing the US Constitution. #aksen #SCOTUS
. Don't worry, @lisamurkowski , the baggers hate you anyway. Woman up and vote. Don't hide behind McConnell's skirt.
. @lisamurkowski Because teabaggers will crucify you if you don't and sane people will drop you if you do.
@lisamurkowski Kennedy was confirmed in 1988. During an election year. There's your precedent. #stoplying
@lisamurkowski You're in an election year too. Why should you have a say in the matter when you may not be in office next year?
@lisamurkowski Nevermind that such a precedent doesn't exist and y'all are just making shit up as you like to do...
@lisamurkowski I would expect this kind of lie from Mitch McConnell, but I'm surprised to hear it from you, Senator.
@lisamurkowski what precedent? Ronald Reagan?
@lisamurkowski As a taxpayer, may I ask why you believe Congress shouldn't do it's job during election years? I still have to work.
@lisamurkowski Will you read me another bedtime story.  I love fairy tales.
@lisamurkowski  There is no such precedent! How gullible do you think people are? Wait, don't answer that...your tweet says it all.
@lisamurkowski Having your @SarahPalinUSA moment Lisa? #whatprecedent
.@lisamurkowski there is no precedent and you are simply trying to score political points. You and the rest of your party have no shame.
@lisamurkowski You are delusional thinking that there is a precedent. Do your job and vote yes or no
@lisamurkowski I think you need a history lesson http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/ …
@lisamurkowski You are one more RAT following the Pied Piper. The #GOP has rewritten the rules and want to force feed it to us. NO GAME!
@lisamurkowski When did you become such an unprincipled shrill shill?
@lisamurkowski What precedent? What are you talking about? Are you under the influence of something? #stoptellinglies
@lisamurkowski  I guess a black President only gets 3/5 of his term and the rest doesn't count?
@lisamurkowski  I'd love to know who got to you Senator.  You decision is complete BS and unbefitting of you and the office you hold.
@lisamurkowski What precedent?
@lisamurkowski screw you and anyone else who puts the needs of their part ahead of OUR countries needs. You should be ashamed
.@lisamurkowski As others point out, there is no precedent. This sad attempt to deny the POTUS his constitutional duty is unprecedented.
.@lisamurkowski This craven abdication of your constitutional duty will leave your legacy as "just another partisan hack."
@lisamurkowski Why lie about this? There is no precedent for the Court to be short a justice for more than a year awaiting Senate action.
@lisamurkowski Are you kidding? there's no "precedence" here - you guys are making crap up. C'mon, UR better than this. #scalia
@lisamurkowski wow. No precedent, no truth to your claim. Obama is President. Follow the constitution. Do your job and vote.
.@lisamurkowski I may be a liberal, but I had respect for you as one of the last principled, moderate Republicans. Not any more.
@lisamurkowski What precedent? This is not extraordinary. The POTUS nominates and Senate advice and consents. PERIOD.
@lisamurkowski Except for the one created in the minds of  obstructionist Republicans there is NO such precedent. #DoYourJob
@lisamurkowski What precedent? What are you _talking_ about? Has your account been hacked?
@lisamurkowski There is no such precedent or tradition.  Please do not lie to justify your obstructionist position.
@lisamurkowski and those "extraordinary circumstances" are your party's wanting to alter the Constitution to suit their politics.
@lisamurkowski you are wrong about precedent and you know it.your party only follows the Constitution when it suits them. sorry you flipped
@lisamurkowski - No tradition of letting a successor choose the next justice exists. By nominating a justice, POTUS IS following predecent.
@lisamurkowski - "ignored precedent" would b NOT 2 nominate.  Disappointing 2 c that u caved 2 McConnell pressure & misrepresent the truth.
@lisamurkowski you know what you're saying is not constitutional.  GOP are cafeteria constitutionalists.  Do your job.
@lisamurkowski Well, you're abrogating your oath to uphold the US Constitution...but..keep being unAmerican.
@lisamurkowski This. Is. Patently.  False.  Pathetic.
.@lisamurkowski And in case ur followers are fooled by your lie (and care about the truth): http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/ …
@kurteichenwald @lisamurkowski Good grief, woman! You're serving in Congress. Educate yourself b/4 reckless misstatements
.@lisamurkowski U guys make up precedent. There IS no precedent for what ur doing. Ur just saying "the president is prez 75% of his term."
@kurteichenwald @lisamurkowski "Conservative" a misnomer for these guys. 
More like "radical nihilists".
@lisamurkowski just stop lying already. This is why people hate politicians
@lisamurkowski just when I believe you are sensible you change. The President is still the President. Vote.
@lisamurkowski what precedent? Recall Justice Kennedy?
@lisamurkowski About tradition ...
@lisamurkowski   The precedent is that the sitting President is still President has duty to appoint.  Understand this or step down.
@lisamurkowski Just making it up now?  There is NO precedent!  Justice Kennedy..1988.   there is NO precedent.  stop lying.
@lisamurkowski @BarackObama has over 13 items to be #impeached with. WHAT are you going to do if he does what he wants AGAIN?
@lisamurkowski There is no such historical precedent.  #coward
@lisamurkowski how about we have an investigation first! Do you not see the problem??????????#impeach
@lisamurkowski I don't follow. What tradition and what precedent? Please cite. Thanks.
@lisamurkowski Hello? Just cite an article I can read about tradition and precedent. Do your followers want to help you out here?
@lisamurkowski What precedent? Can you cite one, because those of us with inquiring minds want to know. #horsehockey
@lisamurkowski Only precedent here is 7 years of McConnell obstruction. #disgrace
@lisamurkowski That precedent, that tradition, does not exist.
@lisamurkowski. Please do your Constitutional Duty. VOTE on our SC Nominee. There's No Precedent Not To. 
Read http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/ …

@lisamurkowski You mean the precedent in which Reagan's nominee Kennedy was confirmed in election year? Along with 13 other nominees?
@lisamurkowski What "precedent?' What are you lying?
@lisamurkowski stop obstructing governmental process! stop being ridiculous. work FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS NOT YOUR LOBBYISTS!
