Today, Sen. @lisamurkowski spoke on the floor before voting in favor of Bernhardt to be @Interior deputy secretary. https://youtu.be/dor1Igi0SZY 
Sorry #Murkowski  Your opinion & endorsements have lost all credibility.  You will never be trusted by voters again

Folks will remember what YOU did today come voting time! ACA is imploding and YOU don't care!  #MAGA
Senator Murkowski, with all due respect, no one gives a damn about Interior Secretary. We care about Repeal O-Care, tax reform, and Wall
You women have more strength then those weak men you work with. Don't fall for the hype, the people will respect u more 4 standing up!
Thanks for continuing to screw over the American people. We will remember this when you come up for re-election. #SkinnyRepeal

Please, please don't take away my health insurance. I have a heart condition and work for little money to advocate for abused kids. Please.
Please repeal obamacare. Many people i know are close to bank bankruptcy due to obamacare; their premiums have doubled/tripled since 2010.
Liar.  Personal bankruptcy has *decreased* under the ACA. Fact.

Another brain dead person here
Your part of the problem is DC. #DrainTheSwamp  Alaska deserves someone that will keep their promises!!! Like our Great @POTUS

You're such a coward. How dare you call yourself a Republican. As long as you get yours, right?!
WHAT AN IDIOT      WHY nO ON THE hEALTHCARE VOTE FOR A DEBATE YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR JOB  EXPLAIN YOURSELF !!!!!!!
This was not even the vote to pass the bill. Guess she doesn't care enough about the people to vote against the "debate". She's a true Dem.
You should've united with your party on that boat yesterday

In 2015 @lisamurkowski publicly and enthusiastically supported a FULL REPEAL of Obamacare. 

Now she opposes…
Thank you for your No vote today! That took guts and your constituents appreciate it more than we can say.
SHAME on YOU for voting no on the bill today.  You WILL be voted OUT.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS #MAGA
Support our President!
VOTE YES!
Thank you for voting NO!
Silver lining should they pass this disastrous piece of garbage, is Trump & his co-conspirators will be out of office B4 they can implement
She Lost Her Job If She Votes for Trump care Worst piece of health care legislation ever Written @JohnKasich @nytimes @WSJ
Republicans WON, because of a very important promise.  Repeal the #Obamacare DISASTER ... like you PROMISED THE VOTERS!
Read some non-fake news, botski. Ask the thousands of people who are ALIVE because of ACA.
Please vote no on health care motion today.  It could cause the death of thousands and no one is telling us what's in it first

If GOP votes to proceed to a bill w/ no text, no hearings, no CBO score, no clarity on Byrd rule, they deserve the fiasco they're inviting.



President @realDonaldTrump & every @SenateGOP member need to read this 10-yr-old boy’s letter before they repeal his mom’s healthcare today. 
Stay with your West Coast Senators
The Senate is considering #Medicaid cuts that could affect health care for 1 in 5 Americans, 74 million people. http://kaiserf.am/2vUC7ye  

The Senate bill would allow insurers to charge older adults 5X more than younger adults, up fr 3X more in ACA http://kaiserf.am/2v21Ic7  #BCRA 
Lisa please vote no on healthcare. Be a hero to America and demand a bipartisan fix to ACA. We believe in you

7,000 Nuns
"The sisters say they are 'united in opposition to the current Republican health care proposals.'" http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_597616a6e4b00e4363e11315/amp?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004 …

Please remind those who don't understand, #BCRA denies access. Junk policies or unaffordable pre-ex pools = no access, no chemo, radiation. 
So...your out in!2018 I have friends in Fairbanks
And Russia too.
Please vote down the healthcare bill!Your constituents deserve it & you know it.  How can anyone vote on a bill they haven't seen?
Please Do the right thing on the health care bill and vote it down! Your constituents deserve it & you know it.  Don't let GOP bully you!
No tax cuts for billionaires
Is he a Dem too?  I see most all the posts on your site are from non Alaskan Dems. RU going to file dem next election & represent them?




If the Dems REFUSE to wrk w/ Trump then screw em! Do it behind closed doors... why not?  The republicans have 2 go back home w/ final result



@EnergyGOP @Interior Repeal & Replace

@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @GOP We will never forget what you put us through. Rollercoaster of misery & helplessness. Our lives devalued.

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback)

Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do.

4- Take Alaska. @lisamurkowski, when GOP leaders told you that the ACA was broken, did they tell you they would massively  ppl's costs? 
LMAO  ALL YOU CAN DO IS HASHTAG.
Isn't he more likely to be listed as an asset on corporate balance sheets?
Senator, tweeted @farenthold that duels are illegal and suggested he challenge you to an athletic contest instead.  My bet would be on you.
Will he help with affordable health insurance, you know something less than Trumps 120% of annual salary version?
