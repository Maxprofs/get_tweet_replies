" word of honor, i didn't know what the land value was assessed at".. please
Who would have thought back then, you would help save millions people
s healthcare with a vote. Thank U again.  #Perspective
YOU are NOT 15 any More, Like McCain Time is Running Our and YOU will be Meeting The Lord where You will have to Explain Your Sin and Crimes
Wish you would clear out your voice mailbox and respond to your constituents who lost their insurance in your state.
Sorry Becky, but Lisa's email is currently filled with voicemails from fellow Alaskans thanking her for her no vote! #GrahamCassidyFailed 
Yeah, OK
In Puerto Rico, "people are desperate for" food, water, gas and diesel, San Juan Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz
The photo is OK, what is awkward is that we do not know whether or not you would have voted no on the health bill.
She would've voted NO just like she did when we needed her!
Senator, your signature is needed more than an old photo. Please use your authority to bring aid to Puerto Rico.
.@realDonaldTrump should use his authority to more quickly & comprehensively respond to Puerto Rico & the USVI. These Americans need us. 
Actually Senator, you had great hair!  Not awkward at all.  :)
For a good cause.
Really cute!
U gotta add #puberme, Senator! 
While you like to think you're a hit; Alaskans wo heath care are dying of opioids overdoses at a rate higher than national average.
Adorable!
Future president! Lisa 2020!!
Aww. So cute.  
Don't you have more important things 2 do than share awkward pics?  Like #governing ? Like making sure #PuertoRico gets the help they need?
These #PuberMe tweets are a fundraising effort for PR relief sponsored by Stephen Colbert, so not a waste.
You know what @lisamurkowski since u lied about repeal & replace of #Obamacare it would be nice if you help pass #TaxReform 2 give us relief
She is waiting for a Rep. to come up with a sensible alternative. Work with  Dems to  accomplish that and life is good for all of us.
same awkward look you wore for a week after handing your soul to big mitch, got lucky this time thanks to @SenatorCollins , learn from it li
Bless you!  Trump's incompetence is #shameful. Please help #PuertoRico
Where's the silver spoon?
You're awesome @lisamurkowski
Rather adorable actually
It seems like just yesterday you were a Young Innocent 15, But Now Your Time is Running Out You'll be meeting The Lord Soon. Repent /Confess
It's great -- every brooding 15-year-old has that expression! So cute!
Even then she would've #VoteNo !
Who abused you? Daddy?
Gret pic. Looks like you were listening to the "pre-conditions coverage features of #GrahamCassidy."  :)  Have a good weekend.
When u weren't a traitor to American people

You look like your protesting something and it's not going well.
Can't spk to the 15 yr old you, Senator, but as a supporter of good health care for all Americans, I want to thank you for standing firm
No Senator, because adorable is not the same as awkward!
A young girl in the midst of teenage angst.
Dear Lisa, you are supposed to use a special hashtag. Greetings from 
Love it
What a fox. Look at that jacket!
Stop trying to endear yourself to the people you screwed over @lisamurkowski, it's cheap and transparent
Love you for this 
That's a remarkable photo for a teenager reflecting poise, determination and dignity. It has an invisible writing across the jacket, too!
Thinking “ how tough is being a Senator “? Going for it I’ve got this”!
Thank you Lisa then and now. We really need you!
All the angst
Cutie!
Nope! Mum.
Not awkward at all! Lovely...and smart.
I agree. I have to say, @lisamurkowski was a good-lookin young lady.  She's got a good look about her.
I have an idea. If Doug Jones gets elected over bigot Roy Moore. You & @SenatorCollins should change party to Independent/caucus with Dems
Oh boy you were trouble  the beautiful young lady who grew up to represent her Americans  protect and fight for their rights! You make all of us proud of you Thank you @lisamurkowski
Great jacket.
You were cute Turnagain or Romig?
You rock Senator!
In all seriousness, that's a pretty cool jacket.
#PuberMe Thanks for your support Senator!
What support?
Actually it's really cute.

Emo Lisa!
You were cute!
There is a look in your eyes that says you are readying yourself to introduce change...status quo can not be accepted.  You are a true 80's
So much angst.
Thank you.
I have the same look on a picture of me at 15! My kids asked why I was mad!
Nothing awkward about it, except for the blue leather jacket 

Apparently blue jackets are your thing Senator 
You look like a pretty young girl who knows damn well what she's in for. 
That is you??  I thought it was me.  
#puberme @lisamurkowski @StephenAtHome
Okay @StephenAtHome - is this photo of me at 15 years old awkward enough? #PuertoRicoRelief 
Lovely then...but like many on the shy side...
