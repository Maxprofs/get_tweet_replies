Bless her. She chose in the best interests of our children. 
Thank you for caring about my child's future. I am grieving that your colleagues don't.
Lisa we know why your betraying party and pres. we see the big union donations and need 4 Vols. $ for kids. Sad
@repdonyoung  @DanSullivan2014  CONSIDERING 16 YEAR OLD KIDS CAN sign themselves out of school is hypocritical
she has no idea how many of the 60000 calls about DeVos were actually from her state.her #went out nationwide.
#JoeMiller2022
Leave it to the women to actually have a spine #shocker
I won't watch katie, so did she ask you what it's like to be a traitor?
IT IS TRULY AN HEROIC ACT TO STAND UP AGAINST DEVOS! 
good for her voting for what's right instead of party
It was just a political stunt. She knew it wouldn't affect the republican outcome.
I get that Lisa state with less people than most congressman. She needs that NEA $. Screws kids
God bless Betsy DeVos.

The Founders did NOT like government schools ... !!!
thank you Senator for having the courage to vote  for what is right.
LOL, everyone here congratulating her didnt vote for her.
thank you Senator for holding our children, country and future over party and #devos 's money.
Thank you for listening to your constituents
Vote #NoBetsyDeVos  Incompetent Unqualified Pay for play  You owe more to American children than this!
hello Think you meant "political suicide" thought I was only one left words out :)
Thank you for voting NO dear senator. Courage!
Union money - don't pretend it's not. It will be remembered.
Make sure you get support from NEA instead of ensuring better education.
U need to vote for B DeVos n stand up against the Teachers Union
God bless President Trump.

The Founders did NOT like Government schools ... !!!!
After reading comments from this interview, I thank Lisa Murkowski again for standing up for what is right.
Right! Did u discuss campaign donations Lisa receives from NEA? Is Lisa racist? Giving poor kids rotten schools.
thanks for standing up. Your one of the few left in senate that make me not ashamed to be GOP.
Bad move, Sen. Murkowski. Americans demand private alternatives to the indoctrination centers controlled by DC.
Thank you for not voting with your party, but voting as an American who cares for our students! Thank you!
Thank you!!!!  Thank you from public school teachers and parents of public school students!  Thank you!!
Thank you Senator!!
Senator, you have sold out your soul and your vote to the NEA union to repay their campaign contributions. SHAME
I see your point about the choice of DeVos but you're again the wall?Sounds like a trouble maker to me!#Trump
WE KNOW and  @SenatorSessions  KNOWS about YOU...#Pizzagate is REAL !!.. YOU ARE GOING DOWN. HA HA HA HA
Thanks for voting against DeVos. Please vote for someone who actually cares about Public Education and children.
Tell her to convince one of her Republican colleagues to join her, then we will send our thanks and praise
Ask her why she didn't stop DeVos when she had the chance. Weak move playing both sides.
Everyone knows when people vote against the will of the people and against freedom it is for money. #boughtout
She thinks she needs more money from the teachers Union so she votes against poor children having choice.
You are going down voting against choice is the way you are going to loose your seat and good bye. will remeber,
She is not the Answer. Being a retired teacher of 35 years, she doesn't even begin to know Edu Process
Thank you Senator, for standing up for our children and the importance of education !
noooooo! Vote YES!!
senator murkowski. Please reconsider your vote!
Thank you Senator for your opposition to Betsy DeVos. She is not the answer 4 education. Democrat from CA
you do know that charter schools are public.  How many conservatives have lined up for the next primary?
@ThomTillis do your job!
Katie did you ask her about the union donations she received and how they rated her? Coincidence? Don't think so
thank you Sen. Murkowski for doing the right thing. Betsy DeVos is woefully unsuited as Education Secretary
I hope the POTUS ends the DOE
It's perverted and a cesspool of money grubbing politicians.
Thank you for listening to your constituents!  Many lawmakers do not. You are to be commended.
thank you for choosing what best for the majority of Americas! @HouseGOP @SenateGOP now it's your turn!
Thank you for putting the educational needs of our children above profits
#Murkowski, hypocrite! You received $23,500 from the teachers union! Resign!
Thank you for your commitment to education system. I only wish the GOP would be be more courageous as a group
it's about time republicans stand up for the American people
love you Lisa!!!!
ask who else she can sway @robportman @SenatorFischer
I'm an Alaskan and I believe that a a change from the status Que. is needed Devos should be supported!

good luck with that she is a rino
- @lisamurkowski REFUSES to meet with campus false allegation victims caused by Title IX policies. @Anneeliz1 @AsheSchow @g56yu
some Dens stepped up and VOTED for REP SECRETARY of STATE!now some Reps step up and Vote against Betsy DeVos
you need to stop this you are a republican and the current system in alaska is not working
she musta counted the votes and saw @VP could winnit
@YahooNews @lisamurkowski I applaud the senator's decision. This is not a good Secretary of Education choice.
here's your answer: Teachers Unions bribed her with huge $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
@akgop @GOP @katiecouric @lisamurkowski Have you let her know how Alaskan voters feel about the scripted calls?
Ask will she help sway other republicans? Will she vote against Sessions who is even more toxic?
Of course you are! Why not speak with @SenatorTimScott on his strong support of Betsy DeVos?
please tell her thank you for her courage! Seems very few senators are willing to ask tough ??s and vote no
Please let her know many feel she is a traitor. Absent daddy's name, she has no political career.
She really needs to VOTE Yes katie
Tell her AK thanks her for listening to her constituents & respecting our voice.
from a parent of a special ed student, thank you!
ask her why she is undermining the democratic process and election
I would love for you to ask her if phone calls and public pressure influenced her decision. I called yesterday
good for you I bet you it helped
thank you, Senator Murkowski!!
