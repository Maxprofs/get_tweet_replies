Just one big F-ing party. I am sure you'll be in the rose garden celebrating passing this murderous HC bill.

Trump care is a huge tax cut for the rich while killing the poor.  Tell us, why do the rich need another tax cut?
As Independents we respect Republicans and point of view, but not Career Criminals - get Trump out of People's House!
Please vote no. It's not only Alaskans who are counting on you. Millions in USA will suffer just so Repubs can get a "gotcha, Obama" moment.
Please vote no on healthcare save my fellow nurses' jobs and our patients' lives thank you
I am an Alaskan voter. Do not approve GOP healthcare bill.  You can do better for the people Lisa.  Do the right thing. We depend on you.
When #healthcare is under attack, what do we do?!  #standup #fightback #AmericaSpeaksOut
1. I really like your dress! 2. Please vote no on Trumpcare. 3. Seriously, please vote no on Trumpcare! 99507
You gonna take Mikes Medicaid? Only a Monster Would!Picnics while he worries daily?
https://twitter.com/AmerAcadPeds/status/877942669930098688 … vote NO please!
The U.S. Senate's health care legislation, at last unveiled today, fails to meet children's needs. #KeepKidsCovered http://ow.ly/oH9y30cOzNF  
Please don't take away my health insurance. We are counting on you @lisamurkowski
Please do not vote along party lines on this one. It's too important and effects too many lives!
Imagine passing this Death/No Healthcare/Tax Break for the rich bill and being able to see a person with disabilities knowing what you did.
Do you think your "gated community" funders will have enough after you transfer 1 trillion in healthcare for poor into their pockets?
Please vote NO on the healthcare bill!! Protect all of your constituents & all Americans!!

Senate health bill lets states undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. Here's how: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/ahca-senate-bill-preexisting-conditions/531375/?utm_source=atltw …
Senator, please, for the love of God, put America before the ambitions of your party and vote against the monumentally awful Trumpcare bill!
Obama's mess!!!
How about working to preserve healthcare so interns & the rest of their generation can have & afford it. You & some Reps w/ Dems can do it.
Please vote NO to protect 62,500 great Alaskans who will be *unable to afford healthcare* under this bill. No one should live w/o healthcare
I already can't afford It!!
Then you would want them to vote no on a bill that won't change anything for you.
Were they there?
Glad your interns had fun. It is imperative that you vote NO on the health care bill. It's an awful bill that hurts elderly, poor & women!
The first family includes a porn star, an idiot who peddles her clothing line and a man who grabs pussies. Good times, wingnut.
Will you all have HC? I won't !what about jobs across America? Fix the AHC
Why do you suck up to Agent Orange?  You were once better than that...
Looks like you have a lot of work to do. Can't just sit back & collect dirty lobbyist money. Who do you serve Senator? We will remember.
4 BEAUTIFUL BOYS W/AUTISM. I UPHELD PROLIFE VALUES.  PLZ No survival of the fittest. America gained while Americans lose! #autismisevolution
No one cares about a damn picnic. You're losing touch with reality.
#autismisevolution Humanity EVOLVED & SO so must HCARE. Generations b4 tainted the Earth. If PRO LIFE stand against it. I have 4 ASD babies!
So no mandate but requires covering preexisting conditions?  Won't that make insurance super expensive?  True death spiral
OK back to U Senator. The SOA #akleg refuses to address the unethical spending in Alaska Student Loan Corp, no over site here
Any of em single?
Please do not vote for a bill that kills healthcare for women their age, in different economic circumstances.
