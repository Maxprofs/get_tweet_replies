@lisamurkowski Given perpetual institutional obstruction by Republicans, Americans will wake up & sweep the pigs out of power in November.
@lisamurkowski February is not the middle of the election. Your lack of principles is appalling.
@lisamurkowski The middle of an election? Silly me! I thought the election was in November!
@lisamurkowski What about the 65 million voters who elected @OFA in 2012. We want a voice in selection NOW.
@lisamurkowski We are not "in the middle of an election." It's 10 months out. No Court nominee has had to wait that long for Senate action.
@lisamurkowski Middle of the election?  The election isn't for nine more months.  Longer than any previous Supreme Court nomination.
@lisamurkowski .  Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski They already did in 2012.
@lisamurkowski They did, 8 and 4 years ago.
@lisamurkowski the way campaigns are run today, we arealways "in the middle of an election."
@lisamurkowski The American people already weighed in on the direction of SCOTUS. We elected Pres. Obama. Twice. #precedent
@lisamurkowski We already did thanks. In 2012. If it's good enough for Saint Ronnie....
Senator @lisamurkowski -- the PEOPLE weighed in in November 2012, honey. #scotus
@lisamurkowski we aren't in the middle of an election. Neither party has even selected their nominees.
@lisamurkowski Where in the Constitution does it say that the people vote on #SCOTUS? Just a shameful #GOPSupremeCourtShutdown
@lisamurkowski I really was hoping that you were smarter than this. Ya'll have your Puppet Master in McConnell. Pobrecita. And poor us.
@lisamurkowski The people weighed in in 2008 as well as 2012. President Obama gets his SCOTUS pick. Period.
@lisamurkowski The American people did weigh in when they reelected President Obama.
@lisamurkowski It's not the middle of the election, liar. The POTUS has 340 days left in his term. He has time to confirm 3 #SCOTUS justices
@lisamurkowski He has an entire year left in office.
@lisamurkowski 
The American people HAVE already weighed 
in on the direction of SCOTUS...twice.
Stop trying to steal @BarackObama's legacy.
@lisamurkowski We already had a referendum on who got to pick Supreme Court justices in 2016.
@lisamurkowski We the People did weigh in, electing POTUS to a four-year term in 2012. He has a constitutional duty to make a nomination.
. @lisamurkowski It's pretty damned rude of Obama to be president when Scalia's dead, eh?
.@lisamurkowski The people weighed in - see  blowout of 2012. Doesn't count if  POTUS is a Democrat/black, or both?
Given the timing of this vacancy, in the middle of an election, the American people will be weighing in on the direction of SCOTUS. (3/5)
@inklake @elyse4design @lisamurkowski hey Lisa, Reagan appointed Kennedy in an election year. Ask your pal Mitch about that.
@lisamurkowski This isn't the middle of an election. The primaries just began. You might be confused here, though....
@lisamurkowski since in our country we now have a political-industrial complex devoted almost entirely to running elections, all the time.
@lisamurkowski I have no doubt that some people are already looking at the next midterms or even the next general, and making plans.
@lisamurkowski Yep; this is not the middle of an election. We elected Obama; he should do his job and fill the vacancy.
@lisamurkowski Hope you don't really believe what you're saying. Even David Brooks says it's "illegitimate." Historical memory=good thing.
@lisamurkowski You spend 3-4 hours/day on the phone raising money for your next campaign. There is no MIDDLE of an election.
@lisamurkowski just because you're mad Obama got elected doesn't negate the fact that the American people chose him as president.
@lisamurkowski So 1/4 of every Prez's term doesn't count, and they don't get to do any of the duties the Constitution asks of them? Really?
@lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski middle of what now?  11 months remaining in his administration and you think the Supreme Court is too unimportant to fill?
@lisamurkowski We the people decided twice once in 2008 and again 2012!  We the people have spoken!  Time to nominate!
@lisamurkowski it's kinda scary that you don't know how that process works, people elect leaders to make decisions, Obama was elected.. etc
@lisamurkowski Coward
@lisamurkowski The American people have already weighed in on the direction of the SC. We voted twice for that direction. DO YOUR JOB!
@lisamurkowski Guess what?  America is paying attention, and when you are up for re-election...you are GONE!  #endGOPobstruction
Disappointing flip-flop @lisamurkowski, and anti-Constitution. No precedent for denying nomination or confirmation: http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/02/supreme-court-vacancies-in-presidential-election-years/ …
@lisamurkowski Where is that in the United States Constitution?????
@lisamurkowski Hon, that's NOT how it works.  Stop insulting our intelligence.  All Americans not like Alaska Palins.
@lisamurkowski Coward
@lisamurkowski They already weighed in. Neither 2008 or 2012 were close. Obama is President. Stop making up gibberish.
@lisamurkowski  Nov. 2, 2010 = Election Day. Nov. 3, 2010 = MIDDLE OF ELECTION. R's trying to steal our vote.
@lisamurkowski We're never not "in the middle of an election". Presidential campaigns last 2 years, then midterms start. What else you got?
@lisamurkowski yes, and the American people disagree with you.
By a 62-34 margin in @FoxNews poll, voters believe SCOTUS vacancy should be filled now.

.@lisamurkowski By this logic, @potus has no more constitutionally-granted authority. CAN HE EVEN SIGN LAWS IN AN ELECTION YEAR?
@lisamurkowski this is within his presidency. He's the President. Election is separate.
@lisamurkowski The American people have weighed in. Twice. 2008 and 2012. #USSC #SCOTUS #GOPFail #TeaParty #UniteBlue #VoteVets
@lisamurkowski You're on the internet. You can fact check yourself. The smart people who can read will realize that this is a big fat lie.
@lisamurkowski   USA is ALWAYS in the middle of an election. Candidates were announcing intention to run just 18 months into POTUS term.
@lisamurkowski that is the opposite of what the founders wanted.
@lisamurkowski The people have already weighed in.
@lisamurkowski do your damn job
@lisamurkowski The Democrats have never left a seat vacant. That makes them better than Republicans by default
@lisamurkowski The American people already weighed in when they voted for Obama & current Congress & Senate. Stop making things up.
@lisamurkowski When exactly are _you up for election? Why don't you stay out of the fray until the people speak on you
@lisamurkowski What abut those who voted in the last election? The people of the USA spoke!
@lisamurkowski Middle of what election? There aren't even any nominees yet.
@lisamurkowski so by middle of an election you mean neither party has a nominee, only 2 states have voted, & 300+ days left in @POTUS term?
@lisamurkowski They did weigh in. When they reelected Obama in 2012.
@lisamurkowski It's only the "middle" of an election because you people in Congress run things that way. That's your problem.
@lisamurkowski
History Supports Obama Naming a Supreme Court Nominee http://buff.ly/1opNieV 
@lisamurkowski Nice try. Election was in 2012.
@lisamurkowski The American people made their decision on 11/6/12.
@lisamurkowski The people "weighed in" in 2008 AND 2012. Are you trying to imply by your post that @POTUS is only a "3/5th" POTUS? #shameful
@lisamurkowski We decided in 2012, Senator.
@lisamurkowski Election is nine months away.
@lisamurkowski lol u missed last two landslide elections. The people have weighed in and POTUS has a year left. U r being obstructionist.
@BillDavisNYC @lisamurkowski guess what. The people spoke in 2013 and elected a Republican Congress!  No rush needed to replace Scalia.
