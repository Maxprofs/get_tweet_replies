This is the man that wants you to be his water carrier. Women will indeed suffer if this passes & men crafting it could care less. #SaveACA
Mitch McConnell trying to buy your vote w/$$$ for the state in exchange for your integrity. Pls don't cave
NO on BCRA.  Do your job - Represent your constituency.  NO on motion to proceed is the ONLY way to do this.  

DO YOUR JOB!
Great! Meanwhile the entire country is holding its breath to hear how you'll vote on Trumpcare.

Lots of independent journalists rely on ACA markets. Your party leader does not respect the free press. Vote against Obamacare repeal.
VOTE NO on this Pathetic Healthcare Bill!  Don't let Mitch McConnell force you into doing the wrong thing!  Do what's right for Americans!
Don't sell out to Trump, this is a death certificate for many. The people of Alaska put their trust in you, the poor of the U.S needs you.
Have you decided your vote for Trumpcare yet?  Please consider voting no for the health and well being of Alaskans and all Americans.Thanks!

Am I paying for her "healthcare" too?
Please protect the health care of your constituents.  This is so critical to the health of our country.  Please!!!!
Senator, please stand up to Mitch & protect your constituents' health. Trumpcare will decimate rural hospitals and health care in Alaska.
You've already accepted the idea of ending Medicaid expansion for adults in Alaska. It's just a matter of when they'll be out of luck, huh?
#StopThatBill #SaveACA The self-employed need ACA for their insurance. #NoLifetimeCaps #NoExclusions #EssentialBenefits
What does one say to a budding young journalist during an administration that labels anything that isn't pro Trump propaganda as fake news?
GET YOUR JOB DONE! Repeal Afa! @then REPLACE IT!
Liar
Please vote no, Senator. This would be a loss for Americans.
You know in your guts whatever bribe they offer will not make up for the pain it will inflict. Cruz amendment makes this law DOA! #SaveACA
Vote no on McConnell's horrible health care bill
Everyone says your being #Bought I hope not. You want to be the person who ended Medicaid in Alaska #Legacy
Please think of her healthcare needs and #VoteNoBCRA
GOP saying they forgot to include "unworkable" Cruz amendment in bill they sent the CBO to score.
@SenateMajLdr
this is legalized bribery is that what you signed up for when you became Senator?
The Billion alaska will rec. is only if premiums r 75% higher. It will chg. then what? u will have voted against ALL Americans. #StandUnited
Your silence on healthcare bill says it all. McConnell gave you a sweetener so you'd vote to take away healthcare for millions.

Nice picture!  This is a welcome respite from the healthcare debacle by GOP, I am sure.  Good luck to this young person.

We all need medical help at some point humanity not $$ should guide ur vote Keep Medicaid intact No No No 2 Trumpcare
No vote without a full CBO score and discussion.  This bill will affect everyone in the US--- except Congress.
Please vote no on the horrible health care bill
Does she have Healthcare?  Ask Zoe if she wants healthcare.
I refuse to accept the statement that you sold your soul...Did you?
So when will you be brave enough to come out for the people and against Trumpcare?
Ask her what her health care plan is after she is no longer covered by her parents' insurance.

The push for a bipartisan repair of the ACA grew over July recess. This week, we must fight to hold onto it.

Ask her how your vote on healthcare will affect her & her family
Make sure she knows that you sold your vote to McConnell.   Her future health is in jeopardy thanks to you.   #killthebill
give $800 billion to medicaid instead of Trump Tax Cuts that Cost $7.8 Trillion, Aid Top Earners, Study Finds http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBEiIdb?ocid=st … …
86% of the US is opposed to Trumpcare...isn't it  supposed to be "by the people, for the people"
hope you don't sell out the women on healthcare...planned parenthood?
Free press and independent media are important. Good for those working on it young.
Cool! Did you tell her you'd vote NO on #Trumpcare n Cruz Bill right? Cuz it guts Medicaid n Blue Cross says it's unworkable n no @PPact $?
Great Alaskans like Zoe deserve HC coverage no matter the reason. Stand up for the American people and NO on MTP on this terrible HC bill
Bill shouldn't even up for debate. VOTE NO on a motion. It was crafted in secrecy, most likely by PAC's, w/ no public debate or prof. input.
Obviously a great young lady with enormous potential. I hope she doesn't have any pre-existing conditions. Vote NO on Senate healthcare!
But it just occurred to me: Zoe does have a pre-existing condition: she's a woman. VOTE NO ON REPEAL/REPLACEMENT OF ACA.
lol

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
McConnell wanting you to approve a vote for "debate" is disingenuous. We need public hearings and consults with docs/insurers/citizens.

3. Pence says Medicaid isn't being cut. The governors were told this by independent analysts. 

2. The Administration claims that Medicaid is "not being cut."

Here's what governors were shown. 

We came to tell our Senators that we demand a NO vote on the death bill! And they had us locked up! #ClergyForCare @TheRealFPL @JenButlerFPL 

Arrests happening now in Columbus offices of @senrobportman.  Disability advocates urging him to #SaveMedicaid but are arrested instead.

Wow: watch Susan Collins absolutely rebuke Trumpcare, and admonish GOP colleagues for not holding a single hearing. 
Please do not vote for Trumpcare. It's not a good fix.

Holy guacamole, we had 1300 people at our Martha's Vineyard town hall this morning! This is what democracy looks like. Thank you for coming! 
Senator - 71% of citizens want a bipartisan fix to the ACA, and every medical prof. group, AARP, insurers, etc. say VOTE NO to this bill.

.@SenatorCollins: GOP health care bill "could lead to insurance plans that really are barely insurance at all." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR
