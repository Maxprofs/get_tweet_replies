at least your doing this right. You need to be fired
Do you think Pres. Trump will get the money to build the wall? approval from Congress? I'm working on a story @TelemundoNews
thank you for your no on DeVos, would have been better in committee!
Hoping you will vote for Devos.  She represents needed change.  To deny her is a slap in the face of Republicans.
no, discerning Republicans will choose a qualified candidate, not DeVos.
I believe she will be confirmed anyways.  Lisa is out of the closet now. We all see she is a Democrap.
it's not partisan to care about qualifications. Glad Sen M was listening to her voters.
Three Anchorage public elementary schools are being forced to become behavior modification schools.  Rubber rooms-
- are being installed, straight jackets will be a common sight.  Families in those school districts need choices.
What about rural schools?  DeVos is a one trick pony.  Vouchers aren't the only answer.
is this a military charter school
Vote for Ms Devos. Public schools right now are a mess. I have to homeschool my sons. If you don't, you will lose your seat.
Alaska may be doing great, but the balance of the country is not doing so well, kids can't read or do simple math, terrible!
this is ridiculous we need this talent to fix our failing educational system, particularly failing to educate in civics...
Thanks for voting no!
you should be proud not being on this kind's side http://www.newsweek.com/pepe-frog-hate-symbol-alt-right-503773 â€¦
yet you still change your avatar to hide it.
Short sighted, bordering on ignorant. From MI & the DeVos's have done great things in education.What's your Problem?!!?

POTUS should EO to eliminate DOE. It's politicized by unions & waste of tax payer $. States can handle.
You are doing a fine job, but the agenda of public educators is to remake country as socialist. Reason no teaching of Civics
#DeVos As a member of NEA/OEA and retired educator, you are being misled. Pub Education has been hijacked by alt left
