ALASKA, Plz let Sen M know: the latest #GrahamCassidy bribe is not enough! When Medicaid is destroyed AK will be left in the cold! VOTE NO
Come on, Senator, this deal is a Trojan horse. Please bring back regular order to the Senate. #Graham Cassidy is wrong on so many levels.
come out with it already & tell us you will vote NO on #grahamcassidy - a bill of this magnitude with no hearings & no CBO is unconscionable
please vote NO!!  20+million Americans are counting on you!  Stand strong
...We may not be your constituents, but your vote affects our lives. Please vote responsibly and ethically - VOTE NO on Graham-Cassidy.
PLEASE COME OUT AND SAY YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE "NO".  Keeping the country in suspense is not right.
Vote "no" as you did last time.  Are you really going to be bought off by money for Alaska that will be easily taken away after your vote?
We cannot hear anything you have to say until you do the right thing! Nothing is more important, do it now!
Pls don't force on rest of US what wasn't good enough for your citizens. Morality demands a NO vote on Graham-Cassidy...

Wow. 
...& if morality is not enough, consider whether you want citizens in 48 other states showing their gratitude in your campaign coffers...
Please vote NO NO NO NO

...or whether you want citizens throughout US working to kick you out next year by funding your opponent....
Liar
...Congrats to UAF. Sen Murkowski please put country over party and vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Fix the ACA..
Graham Cassidy would kick 15 mil from healthcare per year in 2018 & 2019, while 21 mil per year would lose coverage btw 2020 & 2026.#voteno
The new version of Cassidy-Graham may be crueler and more cynical than the last.
Fraud !

The Republican #GrahamCassidy bill would leave more veterans uninsured and increase demand for VA care higher than before the #ACA. 
Vote No, please.

We are all Americans and must unite to protect the future of health care. Please vote NO.
The ACA allowed my son to have insurance and start his own business. He now pays for the ACA Platinum Plan for all his employees.
Dear Senator during this week we are counting on you to have the courage and conviction to say no to the Graham Cassidy bill. Thank you.
Vote to repeal.

#trumpcare Vote NO Sen. Murkowski. Don't let them bribe you to vote for something you know is bad for all Americans.
By voting "No" on the new healthcare bill, you will admit that D.C., a place over 4k miles away, knows better for AK than the AK people do.
This is a plea to Senator Lisa Ann Murkowski

Please stand up for America

If you say "YES" we will know that LISA MURKOWSKI ACCEPTS BRIBES.
Source close to Graham-Cassidy team says they believe @lisamurkowski still could be a Yes. Same with @RandPaul --
The Republican health care bill would bring 'close to unprecedented' chaos in the health system:
Your political career is over if you plan mass genocide of millions of Americans. How will you sleep at night?
Source close to Graham-Cassidy team says they believe @lisamurkowski still could be a Yes. Same with @RandPaul --
