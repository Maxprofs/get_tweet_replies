You are not representing The American ppl. You broke your promise along with @SenatorCollins by not supporting the new healthcare bill.
I am really curious to know what you find good about this bill?
Personally I think it needs to be more conservative but that'll never happen cause of these moderates. The entitlements need to be gone.
So what do we, as a nation, do about those folks born with a chronic condition, a disability, etc?
I have pre-existing cond. & they're keeping that. I see you support Pocahontas aka E Warren so I know your for single payer which is nuts
I follow E. Warren, I don't blindly support everything. My question was in regard to entitlements, and which entitlements should go away?
All the mandates. It's killing not only insurance companies but businesses. Especially small businesses@' workers that can't get part time
I voted and supported you for years as an Alaskan BUT NO MORE as you are apart of the DC SWAMP  - You really do not support our President
I am really curious to know what you find good about this bill?
Not much! But I am very disapointed with Murkowshi's voting record and non-support of OUR President.
Color me confused. If there is not much good in the bill, why should she support it? And should we blindly support everything a Prez does?
Murkowski is deceptive - I used to live in King Cove and she came and lied to our community about her support - she is not trustworthy
The things that impact Alaskans impact all of us, so I am thankful that you are recognizing the flaws in this approach. No tax breaks!!!
You & @SenatorCollins are basically democrats by not supporting our president. You're breaking a promise to repeal&replace failing Obamacare
Ppl that voted for you want to #defundplannedparenthood 
Christian's don't want this.. by allowing it blood is in YOUR hands
You really think defunding Planned Parenthood is going to stop abortions?  Did prohibition stop alcohol from being produced and consumed?
I don't want MY money to fund any of it! 
And yes I do think it will slow down the butchering
Hope you are enjoying your life on earth2.
Whatever, I'm blocking you now crazy.
NonACO physicians are going bankrupt b/c insurers are reimbursing ACO doctors at higher rates. Money wasted on excess bureaucracy. Abolish!!
Please don't cave in to Mitch's bribe.
.@lisamurkowski The Senate Trumpcare bill puts 22 million Americans' lives at risk. Vote NO! #ResistTrumpcare
ASlavitt helped design Obamacare. He's a wealthy business man who knows nothing about http://healthcare.insurance  cos. Reimbursing ACOs higher
Please continue to consider ALL Americans."Kodiak Kickback"shameless attempt aimed to get vote 4 bill that takes away hlthcare for millions
Stand strong, Senator, and do what others won't. Compromise. Fix the ACA with cooperation from the D's.DON'T fold just to give POTUS a "win"
Hope you see the irony of @SenMcCain's care, & #VoteNoBCRA!
On Health Care, We’ll Have What Congress Is Having
http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/on-health-care-well-have-what-congress-is-having … #ACA
One fact about Obama Care according  pres Obama is it costs Amer $65  mo for insurance wo ceiling limits, denial of care for pre x cond.
Ecc. 10:4 If a ruler's anger rises against you do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.
Healthcare is a nonpartisan issue for all Americans.  Don't settle for a payoff.  Vote No.
To do it right, u must abolish the ACO bureaucracy that has infiltrated medicine & is making managers ,techs, lawyers rich.
#FullRepeal
Senator Murkowski - please hold onto your principles about doing the healthcare bill right! The @tedcruz plan is a failure
Fix #ACA, please do not support GOP Healthcare bill. It will hurt all of America. Please do what is right. We're counting on you.
"Americans to fix"! Exactly. "FIX" the ACA. Best 4 America, best 4 GOP. Major GOP strategic move - be seen working w/ Dems FOR The People!
Fox news has invited you to defend your opposition to the repeal and replace of obamacare.  Can we expect to see you there?
America
Wake up
Your house is being robbed

They are taking your #Healthcare #EducAtion #Respect #Land

You fell asleep watching reality TV
So are you going to cave into GOP pressure and allow this bill to go through?
The government needs to get OUT of the healthcare business COMPLETELY!.  They ONLY mess things up & make it hard on the rest of us!
I plead u to vote "No" on this bill.Many will be hurt by this. To follow Sen McCain and once again lead by exam for the US & Alaskan people.
Lisa, please do not go with party lines. Fight for Alaskans. This bill will decimate health care. Alaskans will suffer.

Americans need health insurance. Help fix #ACA don't vote to repeal it.  We are all in this together.
Please channel money for healthcare for women away from PP and to clinics that offer brth control, testing and treatments but NOT abortions.
Sen. Murkowski. Please understand that Planned Parenthood is about providing abortions even 2nd and 3rd trimester. They're not about care.
Fund and fix the ACA.  We appreciate you Senator.  Save Medicaid.
Thanks Lisa for standing up for expanded Medicaid for people.  I'm in California but we appreciate you.
Please continue stand up for Alaskans. Vote NO on Rep health care bill. There's no health in it, a lot of lost health care
Please work with Dems to fix the problems in the ACA. Please.
@J_blackwell99 I see you in the background there!
Hahaha! TV debut
You're famous!
@lisamurkowski thank you for putting alaska before party lines. It's much appreciated
About that Section 1332 waiver: #NOACA #NOBRCA #FULLRepeal. GOP ran on/ $ off of/was elected for this & your constitutional oath sealed it
That's my senator!!! Love you Lisa!!
thank you!!
We need more senators like you
Please Maintain your NO stance. Even deleting tax cuts still guts Planned Parenthood, Medicaid, and is biased against the aged.
senator murkowski, please stand up for all alaskans & all americans by working on the healthcare bill with all senators (not just repubs).
Protect and save lives!
12% approval in current form 
Please be sincere in this.  It's the best thing I've heard from a politician in months.  We need BIPARTISAN, REAL, REFORM #CountryOverParty
The extremists in the GOP don't want to make the ACA better. Why would you increase the taxes of seniors & make mindless cuts to hospitals.
I wish I could have met you in person when we were just in DC.
Doing it right means fixing what we have not pulling the carpet out from under everyone again.  Fix what is broken don't replace with worse.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BV6LJQIhvhn/ 
I haven't heard anymore on Planned Parenthood. Have you?
Maybe more republicans and dems need to become Independent. I am sure your state would support your decision if you did so.
Please don't allow yourself to be bribed into passing the so-called Better Care Act. It hurts poor and older folks!
From economics perspective, healthy workforce is a key component to a robust economy!
Vote no on #trumpcare. Women, children, seniors, business, poor, and disabled of Alaska deserve better!
Half of my small Alaska contracting biz last year was building Medical infrastructure due to expansion.  Trumpcare is a job killer.
Will you go to the funerals of those who will die prematurely when you take away their Medicaid? Asking for a friend. @CNN
Pls, Sen Murkowski, vote against the BCRA bill. We need essential HC benefits. We need Medicaid. We need rural hospitals. We're all watching

Senator, it's time to start afresh. Work with Dems to make Healthcare work for everyone! Only answer is a Single-Payer system.
"For us as Americans to fix" -BRAVO. PLS hold out for an out-in-the-open crafting & discussion of a moderate, compassionate #HealthcareBill.
You Need to stop with this Death Bill!  Fix what we Already Have!!!
Thanks senator. But you have the power to withdraw everything and work with the Dems? Not a great idea?
I can't afford Ocare anymore. We were promised full repeal. AT LEAST stop murdering babies (PPAct)! I'll sleep in a car if need be. PLEASE.
Vote yes or we'll vote no in your next election let them move south if they don't like it.
You know this #TrumpCare bill is a deadly threat to Alaskans--when you going to stand up for us instead of this #Trump.
Why not meet with Dems and rewrite ACA instead.
#LyinLisa Your true position comes back around after all those fake votes when Obama was in office. Circa 2010:
You're a complete fraud. Tell me again how Joe Miller mischaracterized you when he said you didn't support full repeal. #LyinLisa #RINOmafia
Make big changes or do not support to current version of the health care bill
Universal, single payer is right :)
Thank you for a sane response to an insane bill. Please do not concede Planned Parenthood and Medicaid!
That bill cannot do it right. Please don't bargain with out health care!
ACA is not perfect...rrpair it to cover more people.. .public option would do that...protect indian health services
I don't follow many Republicans, but you are someone who understands what's wrong with caustic behavior at the White House. Thank you!
Fix the ACA.  It has problems.  Fix them.  Neither then Senate nor the House proposals will help Americans get better HC.  Just fix ACA.
Don't repeal ACA. Let's work to make it better, not undo all the benefits by trying to repeal and replace with a tax break bill 4 the rich
Good step? U can't really mean that.  It throws 22 million off of health care and raises premiums for millions more to give rich tax breaks.
Thank you for standing up for a reasoned approach. Nice to see political courage.
Not a Republican but I follow you and want to support your efforts to keep Alaskans' healthy!
YES! Yes! A thousand times,YES!
Super proud of for doing what's best for your constituents and the country. Let's get healthcare right - together ! @pp_action !
Does this mean you are a SOLID no vote on the Senate Bill?!?
Universal healthcare is the way to do it right. And you know it
Thank you for being a sane moral voice in this!!!!
Please don't settle for an unworthy compromise to the ACA. Take time to fix what we already have in place!
Thank you for standing up for @PPIAction!
Thank you for stating that we need a bipartisan effort to fix healthcare. Let's make this happen!
Your statements about working with the dems are propelling ypu onto the national stage. MURKOWSKI/COLLINS  2020.
HOWEVER, the basis of TRUMPCARE, massive tax cuts to the rich, must be cut out of any bill moving forward.
You know BCRA is a disaster.  Improve the ACA by working on a bipartisan basis that includes women!
Thank you for wanting to work w/ Dems to fix flaws of ACA. Stand up to @SenateMajLdr and say you won't vote for any partisan bill like BCRA.
We demand #singlepayer now.
Thank you! This is not a partisan issue! It's an American issue!
Fix ACA with @TheDemocrats and #killthebill #VoteNoBCRA
Millions of lives are at stake....  that cannot be understated.  
DO THE RIGHT THING!
#NoTrumpCare 
#SaveACA 
We are watching ALL of you!!
Good question re: Bipartisan action.  Improve ACA.  Address healthcare not tax cuts. Health & economy will both collapse w/ Trumpcare.
Thank you for having sense and reason. We hope you will not abandon those in need after the recess
Thank you for putting people first Senator. Any alternative that does not expand health care to MORE Americans should be a non-starter.
Repeal the #affordablehealthcare act, that's what was promised
What about national priorities, LISA?  Like the increasing debt.
Have you not been paying attention to what the Democrats agenda is?? They DO NOT WANT the GOP TO SUCCEED. Reality time-support the h/c plan!
Thank you Senator Murkowski!!!!Hope to see bi-partisan input and development of the ACA.
Thank you. And, please Senator, don't cave at the last minute behind the scenes. Work with the Democrats on improving the ACA.
In the meantime, Dems are talking about single payer so you better work fast before that gains traction.
Please do this right, insist on a bipartisan bill.
Thank you for advocating bipartisan bill moving forward. Now is the time to all play ball for Americans!
Thanks for the tweet but GO ON RECORD!  Reject #WealthCareBill and #mitchmcconell and #partisanship.  Serve your constituents w/ healthcare!
Work with the Dems or anyone else who wants to help real people.  Ignore the folks playing with their Ayn Rand dolls.  NO on Wealthcare!
Stay NO on Wealthcare, Senator!  Not enough lipstick in D.C. to dress up this pig.  Need a bipartisan fix, not a tax break for the rich.
Remember ALL EYES are on you;  make the right decision for 22 million people that are at risk.... Plz do the right thing and work with D's
Thank you Senator Murkowski for reaching across the aisle to say you will work on healthcare for ALL of the US citizens!! We appreciate it!!
Vote against Trump care and keep supporting @PPact.  It does NOT have Alaska's priorities in line and would hurt low income people.
Please do the right thing for people in Alaska & all the US
Lisa - thank you for your courage and moral leadership! Alaska is lucky to have you and so is our country.
Just say no. #KillTheBill
I live in Alaska and this will have an impact on my family. Stand up for us.
Just get it done & keep it as far away from being socialistic. Get rid of making it a requirement.
In Senator Murkowski, the state that gave us Sarah Palin largely redeems itself. Plus, hers is a fishing family, like so many in Alaska.
Share the good news @BeringFisherman
well said.
Hope you consider working w/democrats & Collins to get a non-kill bill passed. Unaffected now but not rich, so expect to be eliminated. Tnx
"Please don't let me die." That's what people say to you. Are you listening?
U don't represent Conservatives at all. U hav unmaskd urself as a Socialist. U want legit taxpayers to continue support of free everything.
Just repair the intentional damage done to ACA. And don't give a tax break to the super wealthy
vote for gop hcare bill in 2017, stop the grandstanding.
Thank you!!!!
So great that you are meeting w your citizens!
Proud of reps on either side of the aisle with courage to take an independent stance. Horrified by Trump response to it yesterday.
Thank you!  Thank you!  from both sides of the aisle.  I don't care what they call it; but it does need to have the American people in mind.
Improve the ACA. Don't repeal! Stand strong.
Thank you so much for being a voice of reason! It is so much appreciated, even from those of us in NC who can't budge our Senators. HELP!
Was there no representation from states that could be grievously hurt by cuts in Medicaid - why not? Why did you and @SenCapito speak up?
Then why have we never heard this until now? Why did you not INSIST women be on the hidden panel writing bill?
You NEED to leave well enough alone #ProtectOurCare
Scrap this horrible bill and start from scratch with Dems. The goal should be healthcare for all Americans. #SinglePayer #VoteNoBCRA

Majorities across parties say GOP/President Trump are responsible for any #ACA problems going forward
http://kaiserf.am/2tSpiV8  
Here’s a radical idea: Why not try to find a bipartisan solution to health care? Fix #ACA
@lisamurkowski You are courageous!
Thank you 4 improving this lousy bill.  Priority should b lowering exorbitant insurance & pharma costs. Need #healthcare not #wealthcare
Vote to repeal Obamacare. Biggest Rip-Off Ever.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Thank you. You are a voice of reason. Why don't you talk with the dems on how to fix the system. Especially the women since Mitch left u out
Address AK priorities, but remember the entire US is affected. This isn't 'we don't give a damn how they do it Outside' time.
Millions of ives are at stake.  The ONLY way to do the right thing is improve the ACA.  America is being destroyed ...
GOP leadership has never been about doing it right. @GOP has had 8 years to work on a plan, & this travesty is what your party came up with?
It's time to put your country over party, & work with Democrats to fix Obamacare, not repeal it.
Not if you are advocating Socialist Dem ideas.
Whatever makes you happy
Nothing about that bill is right. You need to be more realistic.
So, don't be #bribable...and it will get done right. #BiPartisan is a very bad word and idea right now. Maybe you can help change it. 
"Bribable" due to current campaign funding. Change who chooses and funds candidates & transfer public subsidies to biz into public services.
A healthcare bill should have no winners or losers. Join Sen Collins and Dem women and do it right. Trump and McConnel don't have vision.
The first few GOP members to stand up to All this nonsense will be the leaders of the new GOP. People over party!
I love your spirit ! Healthcare is a nonpartisan issue , let's get it right together ! Join the discussion @pp_action !
Thank you for standing up for all women of our great nation!! Your stance greatly affected the momentum of the bill!!!
Single payer
Thank you! --for being willing to work across the aisle. Fund and fix #ACA. Call it what you want. Negotiate. Protect constituents. Govern.
Amen sister! Health care is a nonpartisan issue and we should be working together to get it right! Join the discussion @pp_action !
Please REPEAL the ACA end the nightmare.
Repeal!!!
Your inability to flatly state this is a bad bill for Alaska, and the nation, is frightening.
