There needs to be some strict regulations on troubled children in public schools that prevent others from learning.
Please DONT confirm her! She does not support public schools
Please do not vote for Betsy DeVos!  Not qualified as evidenced by her inability to answer basic questions at her hearing.
I am so grateful for your decision not to vote for Betsy DeVos.  Thank you, Senator!
DeVos is BAD for education!!!!
Please, please, DO NOT let BDeVos have access 2 our education system. U know she isn't qualified. Show AK u care about r kids
Public schools need social workers and tutors.  Please don't divert tax dollars to private schools.  #DumpDevos
Please improve all the public schools! #DumpDeVos
Help @BetsyDeVos dismantle Jimmy Carter's payback to teacher unions that stifles education.
@Reince COONGRATULATIONS deVos - do great things for America!
....and I hope you discussed the fact that ALL children are born with the right to an Education!
To @lisamurkowski:

DeVos says she expects something in return for her donation.

Time to #RecuseYourself from voting on her nomination.
choose a more fit candidate. Don't pay to play politics especially when it's dealing with lives of our children #stopdevos
Do not confirm Betsy Devos. Unqualified, inexperienced, ignorant of what job entails and would destroy education.
Thank you for opposing DeVos!
so basically you can be bought.In the age of the internet u can't hide who u r. Shame on you, hypocrite
@BetsyDeVos does not have the qualifications to over see the Dept. of Ed. #VOTENO. No experience in education. #notqualified
Alaska and the rest of the USA deserves better.  Pick a person with exp - plenty of real Educators who are conserv.  VOTE NO
deVos is unqualified to do anything except to destroy public education
I'm praying for this new education Secretary...I support school choice. Charter. Alternatives. Etc
@Reince they are protesting lisa in phx ,so you must be doing a great job
Follow the $ @lisamurkowski @SenatorTimScott @WatchYourRepsSC @SenatorBurr @BillCassidy http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/DeVos%20Contribution%20Data%20%282%29.xlsx …
#NoDevos
PLEASE do NOT give her your vote!
Special needs kids will be written OFF if she is confirmed. Think long and hard about the power you have in this decision.
Alaska needs 100% public school support. DeVos can't guarantee any. My grandchildren are worth more than she can  commit to.
And found out she is deVoid of any plan just like the rest of you about an Obamacare replacement!
Bettys has no care in the world to help out public schools when she spent her whole career trying to destroy it!
You mean Betsy DeVos the hater of education right? You know how she did her best to bring down our education in our..
#1 issue facing Alaska: it has public schooling! How awful! Betsy will eliminate that problem right off the bat!
May your passion and wisdom on educational matters share reason with the new administration.
great work putting kids above party!  Thank you! #BetsyDeVos
get rid of common core!
@Reince #NO TO DEVOS #YES TO PUBLIC EDUCATION FUNDING
Get back to 1955 curriculum save for History and Geography. Ban electronic devises in classroom until HS.
First and foremost...how the hell did Donald Trump get elected?
@Reince leave public education alone!
How would she know?
Ask educators.
she has never step foot in a public school @she is the 1 who destroyed Detroit pub ed schools. No teacher experience @MIBATS
DeVos hates pub ed. Schools r 90% public. She makes off of charters. @AlaskaBATs @NYSAPE @DianeRavitch. Vote no 4 all pub ed
DeVos is completely unqualified for this position & is a disgrace 2 even consider putting our children welfare n her
Hopefully ending the Common core was among those conversations
@Reince vomit
so will we have you to thank when she helps undo public education in the US? Reprehensible nominee for this job, shame.
Try not to sell us out, eh? The only thing keeping ppl like me voting for you, was your progressive growth, last few terms.
native elders remember the days of religious education being mixed with education AKs pay taxes 4 public school & now charter
this appointee I'm sure will pass but Alaskans will keep church in church and school will be separate we will demand quality
Trump can give away to his big donors whatever position he likes Alaskans want education for their children not subpar School
@Reince did you discuss why she HATES public education and wants to destroy it?  We don't want what she plans to do #resist
As a public educator, I'm concerned about a person who doesn't understand education. What about our children w/disabilities?
@BetsyDeVos Ladies in my view the very first priority must be to get Islam OUT of the schools
@Reince   What the hell does a person born with a gold spoon in her kisser know about public education?
American parents say NO to DeVos.   She has no expertise in education.  She will be worse than Arne Duncan
She is unqualified and anti-Public Schools NO #trumpPUTIN Repub-puppets are more interested in privatizing for PROFIT
@Reince shame on you Betsy Devos should not lead a department that she has no personal experience with.
Hi Mrs Murkowski, since u support Prez elect, wondering when is the next pussy hunt?Right.That's what YOU support.Not me..

@Reince a rich woman that doesn't understand the struggles of low income women with kids in school. I'm holding my breath
@Reince what how to destroy the public education system for ur alt right planned system. NO THANKS!
@Reince  please get reed of common core.  We the parents want it gone.
Does this mean you'll support Trump now? You're much like my senator, McCain. Spread good cheer but I don't trust ya!
Yeah common core will be soon forgotten. Go Betsy we need you to be a strong leader and make tough decisions.
@transition2017 like how to pull the wool over the public's eyes to make them believe she is not for Common Core?

@Reince 
Betsy has lots to teach our children. Things like evolution is a myth, God buried dinosaur bones for a gag....etc.
Can you teach about Liberty or is that not in the liberal curriculum?
@Reince Terrible choice - other than donating millions she has no credibility.
MI said no...does that make you pause? It should!
No to DeVos.

one more thing, please get rid of common core..stupidest thing on earth..
microwave, it's just not healthy at all and we want the cooks actually cooking the food..and offer more..
2 the microwave or the oven.  We want our kids eating healthy, but cooked food like they use to..not freezer 2..
eat there b4 I would eat another lunch from school..it's that bad..nothing can be good coming from the freezer..
veg & fruits and a small handful at that.  Plus I have ate these lunches..I hate McDonald', but I would pay 2...
a lot of people have this problem & simply can't afford 2 send lunch everyday and the child ends up with only...
test, the Wheat that is being served in our schools was literally making her sick..now we send her lunch...
4 2 yrs we spent countless # of times in & out getting one test after another until we finally had an allergy...
I would simply ask that these terrible lunch programs be changed, please..my daughter is allergic to wheat...
@transition2017 #MAGA
@transition2017 PLEASE REFORM HEADSTART! Teachers must have real pay, they are abused every day!
I understand school choice, as a parent of a 1st grader and college SR (grad in education) PLEASE let's focus on PUBLIC EDU!
Thank you for your support of the outcome of the election. That shows true integrity. Respect for our country's process.
@transition2017 I hope you suggested she abolish the disastrous core curriculum ASAP.
COMMON CORE CURRICULUM IS THE WORST THING THAT HAS EVER TOUCHED EDUCATION!!! END IT!!!
@LindaSuhler WE NEED TO HEAR ABOUT THE EDUCATION FIXES !!!
Betsy will be Awesome. Get rid of that common core garbage, as soon as you can. Thank you!
@transition2017 did you discuss the $5.3 million that she owes for campaign finance violations?!
#POTUS #WeThePeople #DrainTheSwamp #LockHerUp #CommanderInChief #Flamingos4Trump #Breaking
LUV U @BetsyDeVos !
@transition2017 ~ hey never Trumper: Do what Betsy tells you, and be quiet!
@transition2017 there has been no worse enemy to PS eduction than Devos. I'm a NYC PS parent - she's a monster. #nosupport
