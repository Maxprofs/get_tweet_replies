Voting for the AHCA will be a slap in the face to AK @akchild How can you support the bill but claim you support @akchild  #hypoceite
Senator Please don't support Bill if Planned Parenthood is cut and thanks for caring
It's time for you to do the same, and fight the deplorable Republican health "care plan". At least vote against it.
No Federal money for Planned Parenthood, the abortion factory.

This chart from the CBO report really says it all: low income Americans are asked to pay higher premiums for less generous coverage. 
Think about the children in the 22 million who will loose coverage. Think of 22 MILLION people not one not two but 22 MILLION
Please vote NO to TrumpCare

Tax cut for a 65-year old making $1,000,000: $11,600

Common sense says help. R's say "sucks to be you".  Disgraceful. #votenoahca
Great! Then you must know how important it is to vote no on trumpcare.
& what does Denis McCarville tell you about medical needs of children and families?
Moderates like myself look to people like you, Collins, Manchin, etc to show real leadership. Please don't just fall in line with the party.

The GOP health bill isn’t just about Obamacare. It changes Medicaid forever. Here’s who Medicaid covers. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/upshot/gop-health-plan-is-really-a-rollback-of-medicaid.html?_r=1 … @haeyoun 
Right on Lisa. Oh hey maybe check with Doug Zues about the Bear attack stuff. Maybe see if there's a way to give distemper shots to the bear
Talk to March of Dimes about Trumpcare.
What is your interpretation of #Medicaid coverage under this new bill? #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare
.@SenatorCollins to @GStephanopoulos: "The Senate bill is going to have more impact on the Medicaid program than even the House bill." 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. 
Senator, please oppose the Senate deathcare bill-will kill millions of Americans. If this was a good bill, no need 4 secrecy
thank you senator. They need your protection and support now more than ever. Americans will die if BCRA is passed.
Not a town hall
