Thx to ACA, he's being treated now & will continue to be w/ his preexisting condition. Please #VoteNo on #Trumpcare #Deathcare #Wealthcare
Do you even know whats in the new bill? Im betting not. Pre-existing conditions and Medicaid are still covered. So many lies@
Come up for air from that rock you're under! Medicaid will be CUT! Millions will suffer! They aren't "lies." You're just uninformed. Typical
Doesn't matter. Republican Senators can't pass crap. So when OBAMACARE totally fails GUESS we'll just all be in the same boat.
Hey, something we agree on! The Republican controlled House and Senate can't pass crap! Know why? Because GOP bills SUCK and hurt us all!
Well you had me at beginning but lost me towards the end. Lol
Lol! That's progress! I think the ACA should be fixed, not replaced with something worse.
Well looks like we got nothing. They don't have the votes. Grrrrrh
HOW MUCH OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK DO YOU NEED? #voteno #NoBCRA look outside your office window at noon to hear the voices of your constituents
Just repeal
Just repeal and let 22 million Americans suffer. Sounds like a damn good plan @sdblank4510  just suffer
It's no better or no worse than Obamacare.  And the CBO figures are no better than they were 8 years ago. Gov. Out of healthcare.
Please follow Senator Collins example and insist that a decision of this magnitude be made through a proper process involving hearings
Oh just like Dems did to pass failing Obamacare.
Please vote against repealing the ACA so we too can have illnesses diagnosed and treated !!! We deserve to live too.
In regards to health care.Then find a replacement after repeal. get your ass in a room with the rest of the GOP schmucks and figure it out.
Yes you can do it ,you just do not want to because you are crooked politicians
We are depending on both of you to think of us when you vote. We need health ins and those of us who have lived a long life need Medicaid.
Are you confusing Medicare with Medicaid? Both still available in new bill. Lots of confusion out there.
...and also wishing all Americans access to quality and affordable healthcare like that which @SenJohnMcCain received.
He should be fine because he does not have ObamaCare. Nice all of you in Washington have a different Healthcare.
I wish you and McCain would resign since you obviously don't want to pursue the agenda we elected you to pursue. Just go away.
Difficult not to kind of wish you had found something in your eye and needed surgery.
I am a progressive voter from CA and I wish him a full recovery and u many thanks for standing up to a bad bill. Now help get single payer!
McCain is a nut-job. He is not a conservative. I guess you are.not either, Senator. Please change party affil.
Yes, good health to Senator McCain and Thank you for your NO on repeal alone vote!!!!
McCain's clot was discovered during his annual physical, something those without health insurance (or crappy health insurance) don't get.
I'm not lying, I do work, Your point about cell phone service is irrelevant. Thank you for your input.
Your Next you lying Globalist Democrat
As do we all. Please stand against this horrible health care bill. I respect you as an independent senator who cares about Alaskans.
Indeed! Don't we all deserve the same great healthcare that he rec'd? #VoteNoBCRA #bettercare is a MONSTER & everyone knows it!
I'll be here wishing @SenJohnMcCain to die sooner so people all around the world can celebrate when he is gone!
Why do you want the government involved in your health care?
STEP DOWN!  TAKE @SenJohnMcCain With you! #DrainTheSwamp
Why don't you wish him a speedy recovery to vote for a GOP healthcare bill?
Wishing you'd get off your duff and fix healthcare
Join the other 4 GOP senators who put country before party. This is your time.
VOTE AGAINST THIS HORRID HEALTHCARE. WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND A FRESH START AND A VOICE. WE THE PEOPLE FIRST.
Please stand w SenCollins, so that a bipartisan bill will be worked on,
&even our neediest can have care.
Ppl I know cannot work wo medicaid
The ACA guarantees my son has healthcare despite his preexisting condition and prevents him hitting his lifetime max. Don't make me worry...
Please vote no on the BCRA and get to work fixing the ACA! We need the full protections provided, disaster strikes the "healthy" every day.
Was his surgery planned? Didn't Senate know this would delay health care bill vote? Just repeal Obamacare!
Good thing he has good healthcare incl VA POW care
Please tell us you won't be bought with this Kodiak Kickback thing:
Speaking of great vets, my nephew is an Iraq war vet with shaking brain syndrome from an IED please don't let them take away his health care
New Monmouth poll:

—41% say Trump should be impeached and compelled to leave the presidency

(24% supported Nixon impeachment in July 1973)
Is @senjohnmccain's condition considered to be pre-existing? do you think only US Senators allowed to get qual healthcare?
So, Senator, it appears that @SenJohnMcCain has decent healthcare.  Pls ensure the rest of us do too.  Vote no on the immoral Senate bill.
Thank god he has good health care.   Please vote NO.
Please consider the millions of Americans that will lose health coverage that @SenJohnMcCain needs right now.
I fear it will come down to you and @SenDeanHeller if my possible future health care needs are met. Thank you for saying no for all the USA.
All of us do.  A great and brave American.  And also a pretty darn nice guy!
Please vote no so all Americans have a chance to have good health insurance like Senator McCain has. Don't let McConnell bribe your vote.
VOTE NO, LISA.  YOU'VE BECOME SILENT ON HEALTHCARE.  MAYBE YOU WERE BOUGHT OFF?  MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO TO JAIL?
Yep now work to see TRUMPCARE fail.  Vote NO and lobby to get colleagues to vote NO!!
Wishing you don't accept blood money from @SenateMajLdr at the expense of Alaskans
So you both can take away healthcare?

Why hasnt your office returned any of my 11 VMs? @ktva I have a disability & my senator ignores me
Ole Senator John McCain is one tough man....god speed to him.
My best to Senator McCain.

The word is McConnell is backroom dealing with U to get your aye vote on HC bill. Hope you won't be sucked in.
I hope he will stand with you when you both vote NO.  Then you can reach across the aisle and LEAD BY EXAMPLE!
is it true McConnell is trying to give only your state Medicaid so you vote yes when it comes back? Shameful.
Wishing him well. I hope you declare you will vote no on MTP so we can get to substantive health care reform instead of working on BCRA
So Alaska gets what Alaska needs and you're quiet because Mitch wants it that way? Interesting. I hope your constituents remember this.
The fact you cant stand up for the most vulnerable in Alaska shows you have no business calling yourself a United States Senator! #Trumpcare
True. A YES vote will devastate Alaska. Does she care?
So he can join you in selling out constituents w the HC Bill you are suddenly silent about? I never bought your phony sincerity.
Please vote No! Don't abandon people in this country. Never your vote have been so powerful! Please vote NO!
while I wish no ill will on anyone, does the GOP not see the irony? Don't take away our protections
Grateful he has good health care. To a speedy recovery...
Both of u have the ability to allow all Americans to also have this surgry and be covered. Failure to #Voteno will be a stain on your record
VOTE NO

Maybe Republicans might want to think about holding off on a few wars to help pay for American health care (?)
Protect our children, poor, elderly, ill. Vote no. Please.
You do not understand it is failing,if we do not do something we will all have no health care
Please vote no...
Heard you sold out and are voting with #racistgop to repeal America's healthcare. BTW the BLOODY mandate is the @gop part of the plan!
VOTE NO ON REPEAL PLEASE!! Help the poor, sick & vulnerable!!
It's pretty lucky he has healthcare. Please consider that his surgery, without healthcare, would cost over $300,000. #voteno
Now please replace ACA with something better. Reform tax code to make America more competitive in world for business& jobs. Reduce nat debt.
God bless him with a speedy full recovery!
Me too. Preventive care may have saved Sen. McCain's life. American's just want the same benefits. PS if plan is so good why exempt Congress
Wishing all Americans reliable and affordable healthcare like Sen. McCain's!
John McCain should have been dead when he was sentence to death for being a traitor to the United States
Everyone should have great HC. We all hope he is better soon. #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback)

Good thing he doesn't have #TrumpCare.  Wishing you a speedy recovery @SenJohnMcCain.
