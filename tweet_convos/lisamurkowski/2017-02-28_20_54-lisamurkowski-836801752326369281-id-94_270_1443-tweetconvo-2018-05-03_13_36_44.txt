@WhiteHouse @POTUS "was a cynical act of political theater to mask a radical un democratic vision intended to divide & weaken
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS just wondering Trump gonna show his taxes and close Billionaires lope holes??
@rjjj5thavenw @POTUS I hope Alaskan's get smart about you and get you out of office!
.@lisamurkowski you best get in board and quit playing the independent .@frenchfortrump .@POTUS
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  Great night.
Wow, we are so proud of our President! !
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Pres. Trump hits one out of the park and dems heads explode, this is getting good.
what outline???  Just the same talking points.  A outline gives specifics...POTUS gave none.
Apparently your ears don't work
tell me what you heard to the specific details?
.@lisamurkowski @POTUS He failed that opportunity. Didn't detail anything-just more vague, hate-inciting spew. When will U stand up to him?
.@lisamurkowski @POTUS It was a great opportunity. Im just sorry that the fact checking didnt support his statements.
Long on vision, short on plan.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS what plan? No details as usual POTUS was vague except for how great he is.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS he chose instead to read a sales puff piece from the TelePrompTer.  We are not persuaded. #RESIST
Do you think he will go beyond an outline?  How about facts and substance.  Thx for not supporting DeVos
@AmericanSniperG @POTUS too bad we have a nation of haters who are ruining the values and morals we once had.
Sen. Murkowski,  my biggest fear is you and the house Republican want do what is needed to get the job done.
Maybe it will even get the RINO Murkowski on board. We will see.
BLaH, bLAh, BLah, BLAH.              blah!
what these simple folk don't realize is that it's all show for trump. His cabinet is filled with billionaires
All my friends are heathens. Take it slow
(Watch it)
All my friends are heathens. Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
with no help from dems or establishment rebublicans
@WhiteHouse @POTUS please let's make Washington work again
@WhiteHouse @POTUS so are u finally on board? Get with the program and support POTUS!!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS to sell off public land and pollute the environment and create an oligarchy , yea we get it
@WhiteHouse @POTUS ~   rino
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Heard the "vision". Didnt hear the plan on how he would do it...musta missed something...hmmm...
@WhiteHouse @POTUS and he blew it!
he is a narcissistic racist maniac.  #notmypresident but you are my senator.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS too bad his vision is not trustworthy
@KazmierskiR @POTUS. Get on board Senator!
yes, since the Republicans worked so hard to come together to fix all these thing over the last eight years.  SAD!
.@lisamurkowski @POTUS 
Vision maybe.
Not sold on the 'plans' part
Trump Offers ‘Miracles,’ but Few Details on How to Achieve Them http://nyti.ms/2mryVcM 
WAIT. Did he have any? Must have missed that
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it'd be great if Alaska would outline a plan to recall you. That would would be a step towards #MAGA #DTS
now if only you could stop voting democrat Keychikan
Ketchikan
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Blown opportunity.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Really?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS He talks but his actions are opposite. We don't believe his alternative facts or promises. 2018 is coming!
@LindaSuhler @POTUS Murkowski is a sellout - took Union bribes to vote against Devos. She's pathetic
more like listened to her voters who flooded her office with concerns. She put AK first not party.
Tonight wasn't about President Trump, Senator. It was about you do-nothing RINOS that we're going to throw out!
No thanks to you! Sad!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS He's been doing that, Senator. Pay closer attention!
Agree! We see your obstruction; you need to pay attention to the people.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS until he does a 180 on half of it and the other half is proven false
@WhiteHouse @POTUS: Thought it was interesting how he was taking credit for the condition of America on it's 250th Bday.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS And lie about the number of unemployed Americans?
Where have you been? Lying about unemployment has been the hallmark of past admins.
Lying by 80+ million? That's a pretty big lie, even for Donny.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  and he failed miserably.
Please point to a plan, any plan, with actual numbers like a real grownup white paper, that you have seen from him.
we still need a special prosecutor to investigate the treason committed by this regime.
What? Look the word up..Foolishly accusing w/o knowledge is not very bright.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS didn't hear many plans, just lots of empty rhetoric!
@Mike_Beacham @POTUS GIVE BACK the $$$ YOU ACCEPTED From NEA..YOU R STILL on THIN ICE LADY...as far as I'm concerned!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS lisa murkowski is bought and paid for...former Alaskan who has never voted for her. She's a RINO folks
@WhiteHouse @POTUS he's a liar.  you're a traitor. You are done.
poorly reading a speech from a TelePrompTer without so much of a soulful hint is not a plan!
Jesus. Where were you for the last 8 years?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS we shall see Talk is cheap. I wonder what drug he took to get through it tonight
Shame! The one politician who doesn't drink, smoke, or take drugs.
can't believe the gullible people!
It was a much-needed opportunity. Too bad he never got to his plans & vision.
That's politics .
@WhiteHouse @POTUS which is everything he didn't do. My eighth grade Social Studies Teacher gave us better direction! @CNN
Your teacher obviously is tenured.
I was in her class in 1973-74.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS he has the opportunity to outline and share EVERY DAY. What took him so long?
yes indeed, to bad the nice things were lies and the rest about how great he is. He is not great.
Yes, but he didn't.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Vomit inducing pablum.
I agree Lisa, powerful speech!
It was an empty plea for accolades. Totally substance-free. Barf.
Oh, please. You were as ashamed as the rest of us.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS  WAKE UP AMERICA POTUS IS RETURNING THE POWER JUST WHERE IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE!
People meaning Russian Oligarchs.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS left created this mess, either help fix it or be removed. Maga. Great vision POTUS, get it done murkowski
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I agree for the first time in 16 years I'm proud to say that's my president & everything just might be ok
@WhiteHouse @POTUS We love our President Trump / Pence MAGA Praying always for you all God bless you Thanks
when will Trump release his tax returns and make America honest again?
@PattyMurray Good speech, went from horrible mess & carnage to heavenly utopia.
no detail in his plan still - if you heard it maybe you can let us know what it is
thank you for the link. I got to watch it!!! Education, Senator, we need you involved in ending AK Student Loan Corp
Vision?! Did you notice the love of greed and violence?
He is tied to Russia. Tonight changed nothing.
#Trumprussia
What a bleak future.
