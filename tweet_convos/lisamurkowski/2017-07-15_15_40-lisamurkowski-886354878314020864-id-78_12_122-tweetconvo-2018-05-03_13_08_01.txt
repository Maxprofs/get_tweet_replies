How about a town hall on WealthCare instead of silly salmon games?!?
@lisamurkowski PLEASE READ THIS THREAD from my friend who is stage IV br cancer. She advocates & helps others daily.
1. Hey healthy friends: I love you. I really do. But we need to have a talk, about how you can be a good friend right now.
We're watching.  Prove to your constituents that you can't be bribed.
Please tell the American people you have not been bought off and will not vote to take away their healthcare.
I'm glad you had a blast

Meanwhile thousands of Alaskans are terrified that you're taking away the healthcare you get to keep for yourself

This is Evan. When Republicans talk about cutting Medicaid & giving tax cuts to the wealthy, it’s health care for kids like him on the line. 
Liar
These 2 will never tell you while they are fishing around w/ your healthcare, but they've been bribed and now:
No more protection for pre-x conditions thanks to the heinous Cruz Amendment
And Alaska will end its Medicaid Expansion by 2020- your heroic HHS commissioner Valerie Davidson has been fighting Murkowski against it
#savemedicaid
I am an Alaskan. I work with Salmon. I want the both of you to vote no on the repeal and call for an #auditthepentagon. @michaelcburgess
Nice!!
Just heard you are now a yes on Trumpcare...please reconsider, this is a horrible bill, please consider ALL Americans that will be affected.

Please kill the bill. Save Medicaid and our healthcare please!!!
any money received to vote for Trumpcare is blood money...women will die because Planned Parenthood is defunded
Lisa, be the 3rd Senator to officially come out against this monstrous bill. You're not scared of Trump, are you?

#NoTrumpCare
Politicians in MA never have this much fun.
Mitch is only looking out for Mitch. He will not protect you. He has compromised the GOP's integrity and will let you fall. #SaveACA
Wake up! Trump and Koch will primary you no matter what.  They don't want independent legislature, they want water carriers for the regime.
Will you sell out millions for an plan no one wants from a present most 60 percent of Americans dislike? We will remember
Are you gonna sell out the country?  what about the people?
Look at all those people. Wonder how many will die/suffer as a direct result of your sellout. Bribery over morals, this will be your legacy.
Is it true?  Did you accept the bribe?  If so that is blood on your hands that will never be washed off.
I hear you'll vote yes on healthcare bill! Shame, shame, shame on you!!!!!!!
Alaskans on Medicaid need your help, Senators.  Don't let people die because of an ideology.
All Alaskans should have fun during our summer but w/o affordable health insurance and care, stress will overcome fun. Don't hurt us please!

Lisa Murkowski is being BRIBED. If she is yours, tell her: 
BRIBES ARE NOT GOING TO WORK. #VoteNoBCRA #NoTrumpCare

FACT: The #healthcare bill threats protections for people with #preexistingconditions.

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill 
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #StopTrumpCare #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
This is what Lisa Murkowski told me in March about AHCA: 
Please don’t let GOP buy your vote with extra $ for rural Alaska. Alaskans will still be hurt by pre existing conditions, etc. #votenoonBCRA
It would be really entertaining if you weren't also literally playing with our lives.
Don't let members of ur party buy you off. Alaskans aren't only Americans. Don't kill Americans in other states because u think it helps AK.
So are you yes or no on healthcare. All this other drivel doesn't matter.
#StopTrumpCare
Hope you don't let Medicaid slip  away like the salmon
Worry about health care
Cool! Then you told him you'd vote NO on #Trumpcare n Cruz Bill right? Cuz it guts Medicaid n Blue Cross says it's unworkable n no @PPact $?
If you care about Alaskans, please VOTE NO! #Healthcare #VoteNo #VoteNoBCRA
Glad you had a great time. Please don't destroy healthcare & kill Americans for cheap bribes for AK from GOP. I urge you VOTE NO!
Don't be bought. Please vote no
I know u are being bugged about healthcare but please don't let McConnell try and bribe you into voting yes.  The whole country needs you
Don't be a sellout. VOTE NO on BCRA!!!!
@GOP are criminals, #TomReed, founded a medical debt collection biz & now has his family running it. They sue his own constituents!!

Senator, I  you, but PLEASE don't vote for the awful BCRA! My hubs is diabetic and will lose coverage from his work!
The Kodiak Kickback: the quiet payoff for an Alaska senator in the Senate health bill https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/15/15971642/alaska-republicans-health-care?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … via @voxdotcom
Still waiting to hear where you stand on this new health bill. Will you be "bought" by promises for Alaskans while other states suffer?
Don't let @SenateMajLdr bribe change your mind- we want proper health care not dirty money from a killer
Let's see you go against (and beat) the devastating Senate Wealth-Care Bill
I enjoy that you share your love of home and family. Please vote against hurting American families. Vote no on #Trumpcare
After you vote for AHCA, I can only imagine one of your constituents blowing their Achilles having fun...Sugery will not be an option...Sad!
Please don't vote to take healthcare away from millions. Please take a stand for the people who voted for you

Now just stand up to this disastrous healthcare bill and all will be right in the world. 

"Somebody needs to listen to us." Activists are bitter that they're not able to take videos. Staffer says it's an office policy. 

JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  

RM: @MartinHeinrich: Republicans' latest health care scheme threatens to throw our entire health care system into chaos. 

Healthcare Providers say #TrumpwealthCare will increase premiums, make coverage worse. Hurt Low income, Elder and pre-existing.
