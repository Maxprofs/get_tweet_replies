Bit of a dilemma, considering the effects of Arctic drilling and escalating fossil fuels use vs. climate change, isn't it?
You lying piece of dog crap you promised you were going to vote against Obama care instead you gave us the middle finger.
Senator please resign or leave office. You are not well liked and refusing to repeal Obamacare when you voted to already is lying
"Promote the general welfare" is 1 of 4 reasons America was founded. Repealing the ACA would violate that sentiment. Read the Constitution.
How do you say that since it has caused far more damage than it has helped anyone.
Do you have statistics on that? I personally know many people it's helped.
Look at the statistics!!! Premiums are up and deductibles have sky rocketed. We are talking millions. They also lost doctors
Are you trolling? Surely you've seen the CBO scores for both Repeal/Replace and just Repeal? Both make everything WORSE.
The one with Cruz's amendment scored far better. Lowered cost in premiums and deductibles.
You ARE trolling.
Such an establishment hack. We know you take money from Energy Transfer Partners.  We know that Kelcy Warren is giving you hush money.
Thank you Sen Murkowski for saying no to ACA repeal and promoting a bipartisan solution to healthcare- stand firm !
Gov. Palin, please find and back a conservative candidate to primary Sen. Murkowski in 2023. Don't let Alaska turn blue.  @SarahPalinUSA
Just what you need- another quitter from Wasilla

 BREAKING: CBO: Premiums will increase by ***$11,500*** for a 64-year old with middle income  
Is that the same CBO that said Obama care was so wonderful.
Obamacare is wonderful.  It's just too expensive for some.  The Democrats have ideas to get the price down so everyone can afford it.
Why couldn't they do that in the first place and if Obama care is so wonderful why don't the Democrat politicians have it for themselves.
Congress is covered under Obamacare it's the law.  Obamacare is really good comprehensive insurance.
Just ask @JordanChariton about the hush money. He reported that on @TYTPolitics . The stuff that corporate media doesn't want you to know.
Senator, I & many others believe that humans are creating dangerous emissions & we need to curve those down via using other forms of enegy.
Liar!
Oh brother, a leftist wacko that believes in 'Global Warming'. This woman needs to be replaced in 2018. She's NOT a Republican.
This is unbelievably important!
No tax cuts for billionaires at expense of poor and elderly
You said you would REPEAL Obamacare.
Why'd you lie????????
2018 can't come soon enough.
Sen.Murkowski do you know that 
HUMPTY TRUMPTY said global warming is a big farce! FAKE NEWS.
I just saw your 2015 video expressing how ACA is unaffordable & it must be repealed. Now you're a democrat. You are a disgrace & a liar.
Talk to this scientist. He can explain how this is impacting Alaskan citizens. You DO care about them, right?
Speaking of bone-chilling, how about this act of evil?
@lisamurkowski Please see this Poll 
74% want #bipartisan #Healthcare
3/4 want lawmakers to work together for us all
NEW! @FoxNews #Poll 74% want GOP to reach out to Dems on #healthcare MORE: http://fxn.ws/2uJTLrS  
Whatever! We're not signing up for the "Climate Change" hoax again.
You cost Alaska & US $772 BILLION, tax & Medicaid Entitlement reform & my faith in GOP women. Obama's last laugh @WSJ#Daniel Henninger
Enjoy your last term in senate. Your love for Obama care made sure of that.
Alaska will be hit big time by climate change! Why do you let Pruit get away with those outdated and disproven theories?
Repeal Obamacare or you will be replaced.
So when does this translate to responsible Global Climate Change legislation?
It won't even matter if you contribute to killing everyone by caving in the health care bill after all.
Why aren't we expanding "reflective technologies" in the Arctic regions?
Please hold firm on the repeal vote. Americans are counting on you. Repeal without a good replacement will be catastrophic for our country.
Did you do this before or after you broke your promise to repeal Obamacare?
Barrow, Alaska: Ground Zero for Climate Change.  Tundra lakes are disappearing without enough ice to shore them up.
Dear Senator are the Alaskan ice caps melting , I hope they find out whats wrong & are able to reverse this
Please help the Republicans understand that climate change is real!
Lol, proof that it's caused by humans?
Are you going to be bribed? Shame on you, you monster.
That's only 17% of the bill's $1.2 TRILLION in cuts to Medicaid and subsidies. https://twitter.com/alexanderbolton/status/887815137108926464 …
Senator, it's a bit disingenuous when you voted to approve Pruitt, who's actively working to repeal every rule/law governing climate change
Now we know how precious health how about you vote no on a bill that could end those protections.
IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOU HAVE A REPLACE NOW. YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS REPEAL. NOBODY CAN AFFORD OBAMACARE. REPEAL IT NOW!!!!
Thank you Senator for standing firm on healthcare.
Cbo score Obamacare 27 mil , Ryan first plan 24mil , the house developed a plan 15mil out ,the coffins came out They passed in house 22 mil
Speak to your fellow republicans to see how you can get a health care bill for all Americans.
#RepealObamacare We don't need you nor the government in our healthcare Americans are smart enough to make their own decisions #myhealthcare

Which version is Murkowski reconsidering?

The BCRA version she said she'd have opposed, or the repeal-only version she said she'd oppose? https://twitter.com/ericawerner/status/887753122067742721 …
You don't know? You're outright lying. You know how cruel it is. You're a shameful, evil monster if you vote yes
Lisa Murkowski doesn't answer question about where she stands on motion to proceed.

Are you more optimistic of pessimistic? "I don't know."
Are you sure you're a Republican you sound like a nut you support climate change and want to save Obamacare
The impact of the ice wow what about the impact of our #healthcare #RepealAndReplace

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Senator, MILLIONS of Americans have spoken - over 70% want a bipartisan fix to ACA.  Please ignore the trolls/bots/attacks & STAND WITH US!

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
Please help your party get on board that climate  change is REAL
