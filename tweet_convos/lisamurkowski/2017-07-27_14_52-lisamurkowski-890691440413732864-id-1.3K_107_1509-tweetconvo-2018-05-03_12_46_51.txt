Never thought I'd see the day my 'Conservative' Senator pushed for Socialism. Your have let down your core voting base.
Vote her out! We  vote ours out here in VA! The Silent Majority have had ENOUGH!
It's extremely dishonest to claim to be a Conservative, then vote with the Left. She will be voted out. She has let down her voter base.
Well, time was, Conservative was more a political leaning than stupid animal tribalism, but I get the feeling you're more into the latter.
Yep
this is how god really is psycho'
He never said give them huge deductibles, raise their premiums, tax the other guy and tell yourself you're the one helping the poor
He also never said keep your $.  He DID say you cannot serve both God and money, though. (But that's if you SERVE God, not misuse his name.)
Thank you for standing for what is right for the people. So proud
Really! What about those of us that are losing coverage & paying ridiculous premiums/deductibles! You must have yours paid for! 
The plan they are voting on now will make everything worse.
JUST OUT: AMA calls Senate "Freedom" Act a "toxic prescription that would make matters worse." 
Mine can NOT get worse! Provider pulling out in Dec the past 3 yrs have been nightmare unaffordable and penalties ...yours must be free!SMH
Please consider the future repercussions of Socialized Medicine & the vulnerability it creates allowing Gov to gain power over its people.
Right on!
As a lifetime IND..I want to TY & @SenatorCollins 4your courageous stand in defense of millions of rightly frightened Americans #ACA (1)
Really! What about those of us that are losing coverage & paying ridiculous premiums/deductibles! You must have yours paid for! 
btw...your premiums & deductibles are rising because of the 24/7 uncertainty Trump pumps on healthcare by openly rooting4 #ACA's failure
Unfortunately that's not true. It has been a nightmare for us for 3 yrs, COST going up , providers dropping out ,etc! IT HAS TO CHANGE 4 ALL
Voting to save ACA gives the appearance of kindness but in reality thwarts ppl's ability to be self-reliant. You're voting like a socialist.
Obamacare is Socialist!
It's kind. Unlike many so-called Christians. It's helping those in need like Jesus!!!
Jesus never said others should be FORCED to pay for another's upkeep. The Bible is very clear. If a man will not work, neither will he eat.
Jesus said to feed the poor. Jesus said the meek will inherit he earth, not the greedy! He was also non violent.
Yes he did.But he didn't say to do it through government subsidies & taxation. Today's poor sit at home on their Sect 8 while I go 2 work
God also said do not judge. Just be kind and take the high road. I work every day too! Love is the answer.
WRONG!!!! In order to shun evildoers, as we are told, we must be able to judge evil and those who are doing it. Absolutely WRONG about that.
PENCE PRESIDENT is BETTER for GOP.  No more Trump threats and bullying. Why does GOP defend Trump's antics?
Thank you. I am a cancer patient. I thank you, my wife thanks you &, although he might not understand why, our five year old son thanks you.
eat homemade pickle which madewith vinegar and drink nettletea. They help to kill cancercell and make smaller. I hope it helps u feel better
More photo ops. Get something done we have voted you republicans into the majority and it is being wasted, what are you waiting for
Can Americans count on you to vote NO on Trumpcare tonight?
You let us down!!!! Voted for obama care, traitor!!!! Loser, liar!
You need to read Saul & Alinsky's, "Rules for Radicals", dedicated to Lucifer. Socialized HC is one of the control tactics used in the book.


@Texasvet91 you are a traitor to us. You've shown your true colors. Redcoat.
You are not a Republican go join the DEMS. Oh forgot you are.
Your just pissed off because Alaska is bigger then Texas
@Texasvet91 I served your state and my country there...
Here comes the primary train.....
2010: Murkowski urges repeal of ACA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA09df_ekfA â€¦
Hundreds of thousands of Democrats exodus the Terror Party for Trump. We are our own party, not the Republican Traitors. Vote them out.
if obozocare was off the table, businesses could expand and hire these homeless..this doesn't take a rocket scientist..whose paying you off?
Vote this sellout out!! Weak senator!
Thank you for standing up for the American people, Senator. It's such a relief to see someone who actually cares about the people.
Your honorable actions will be remembered. 
The democrats have moles posing as fake conservatives like this lady here
#Alaska voters REPLACE #RINO  @lisamurkowski WE NEED TO #DrainTheSwamp of the Democrats in GOP clothes! #SkinnyRepeal
This cretin gripes at Dems not getting confirmations done then turns around and forestalls about 6 of them herself.
Time to vote these Dems in disguise as republicans!
They didn't vote as Democrats wanted them to, but as their voters wanted them to.
wait till these same people go to the doctor&they wont accept Obamacare& asthey just said on tv that31%of doctors are not acceptingMedicaid!
That's because of Trump & Republican sabotage to healthcare, not the ACA.
Obamacare was a corpse before the election. Nearly before Trump even declared his candidacy.
Happy you voted no! Thank you.
Enjoy the worst healthcare in the history.
It doesn't matter to me what party you are in..... always act in the interests of everyday people.
You worry about homeless youth yet won't vote to repeal Obamacare your priorities are screwed lady we need jobs to prevent homelessness
Thank you Senator for not caving to the party line over what's best for your constituents. Hope for better bill. P.S. Love that suit fabric!
Get behind Our President, that way we can work together and create more and better jobs for AMERICANS.
VOTE to replace, not mend.   POLLUTED

Thank you Senator for your support.
Thank you for protecting millions of lives. Your vote stands forever, while administrations come and go. Don't be bullied. Courage!
...I'll likely be 1 of the 1,000's of Americans who will die as a result of this misguided & heartless repeal effort..#ACA (4)
No, Spar - This brave Senator put Health Care for Americans above partisan politics & saved us 
It's called amplifying the reality of the situation on the off chance it may be seen by someone who has an actual vote..Run along now...


Aaaah ya


If overlapping healthcare coverage is not made available2me..& considering my dire pre-existing conditions...#ACA (3)
