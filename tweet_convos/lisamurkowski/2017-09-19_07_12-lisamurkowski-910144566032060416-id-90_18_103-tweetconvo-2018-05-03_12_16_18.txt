I voted for #NDAA b/c it boosts our nation's defense capabilities & ensures our military has the resources needed to protect our nation
With the NDAA, we are enabling our military to protect our nation & our livelihood, & providing a long overdue pay raise to service members
Vets need healthcare.  The promise was repeal and replace with something better.  Where's the 'better'?
Do you plan to pay for this by cutting health care to millions of Americans?
If we can spend that much money on the military we can afford health care coverage.   Please vote no on Graham-Cass.
Except medical care, mental health care
Don't forget their dependents who need healthcare without exclusions.
Please do not help pass this latest healthcare version.  Tell your colleagues to stop it!!!
That sounds great. Now let's look out for those they are defending by holding out for a smart fix for healthcare.
Recently lost a close friend. Cancer treatment covered by ACA. Graham-Cassidy would have bankrupted her family. Please please vote no.
We all need support. Vote NO on #GrahamCassidy Your country needs your help.

Thank you Senator please vote #noGrahamCassidy.
Now kindly provide regular Americans with the healthcare they need to...ah, live. Ignore the bribes. Vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Be a hero.
We can spend another $800 Billion on "war" but, you will sell out our healthcare?
What good is defending the dead?

Please support our elderly and their families who rely on Medicaid for dignity in old age. Support the healthcare jobs for working families.
Senator please don't support G/C/H/J! Alaskans need care for preexisting conditions. Input from healthcare pros is essential!
Please stick to your no vote on health care.  Support all the people including military who need access to good health care

New numbers show Graham Cassidy is massive blow to Arizona, Alaska, Ohio, West VA. How can these Senators vote 4 or https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/09/20/this-new-study-deals-a-blow-to-trumps-latest-obamacare-repeal-push/?utm_term=.0e0860551d37 …
It's about time our sons and daughters get what they need to defend them selves and our country God Bless them all and God Bless the USA.

People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
No #GrahamCassidy
Healthcare not warfare, please
As you know, the US military is offensive, not defensive. How about actually defending US citizens by voting NO on Graham-Cassidy?
Meanwhile the Senate is going to vote to repeal healthcare for 20 million Americans!
Please Please @lisamurkowski stand strong against this awful Healthcare repeal travesty.  America absolutely needs you, Senator.
Please don't let #GrahamCassidy pass. It is dangerous and stands to hurt millions.
Yes & more than was requested(again)- what's up with that ?
Thank you! I hope you'll also support 1.7 million veterans (over 3K from AK) who rely on Medicaid by voting no on the #CassidyGraham bill.
I'm afraid I'd lose my care as a Veteran and my son has high medical costs.
Vote no on health care repeal
That's wonderful. Now vote "NO" on healthcare bill which will completely destroy our country.
No to #GrahamCassidyِ
700, 700 billion for the army! But 10, 10 for Houston! How do you mean, defend our country! Agains whom?
As a vet I ask you to honor that commitment even further & #VoteNo on #GrahamCasiddyBill
Vote no G-C! Stay strong.
And it cost 2X more than the ACA. Do the right thing again and save the ACA, please!
