Republicans use state payoffs to win votes for repeal bill http://politi.co/2t0C42V  
So awful and almost evil!!!
Where's your "NO" on Trumpcare? Have courage and come out strongly against. Not good enough to be silent. This is dangerous.
#savemedicaid #voteno
Too bad you don't have the courage to stand up for poor Americans like Senator Collins.
This new GOP healthcare bill will destroy Alaska's hospitals. -- Anchorage Nurses Assoc.

Yeah 75% provisions is gonna really help Alaska.     Medicaids is getting cut tons.
BTW -my AK daughter & AK Friends would benefit from you supporting the ACA & repair, Not repeal & replace. Please help those in AK, VOTE NO
Hi there, are you going to vote yes and exempt yourself? 24 million Americans would like to know.
Cool! Then u told them you'd vote NO on #Trumpcare n Cruz Bill right? Cuz it guts Medicaid n Blue Cross says it's unworkable n no @PPact $?
Been in Homer, Halibut Cove, and Seldovia. So gorgeous there! I know residents there who rely on ACA. please don't accept #BCRA

To be clear: new #Trumpcare deems maternity care, mental health treatment and Rx drugs as essential for Congress but not rest of Americans. https://twitter.com/sarahkliff/status/885575745191497732 …
Explain this to constituents who lose insurance, are priced out bc of pre-existing conditions, or get subprime #trumpcare w skimpy coverage.
Thanks for standing up for vulnerable Alaskans and opposing Senate tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by cutting health benefits to the poor
Great catch Senator...I luv fishing as well, now back to the business of "The People". We need low cost quality healthcare, Pls vote NO!

Senate Republicans protected Congress from the disastrous health care plan they're imposing on everyone else https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/13/15966034/senate-republicans-exemption …

I expect you to betray Alaska residents and flip-flop but hopefully you can find courage to prove me wrong
this would be an explicit flip-flop by Capito, who said opioids funding was not enough https://twitter.com/pw_cunningham/status/885582612659613696 …
I have a Best Friend out there on Halibut Cove! He lives year round - beautiful ! BTW - that is a great restaurant! <3 Many friends in Homer
Selling out on health care!
Vote NO;  be a decent person!
Senator, the revised HC Bill is not the path to fixing things. In fact, it will result in suffering and death for the oldest and sickest.
Vote NO on the Healthcare bill.   You know it is a horrible bill. If you change your vote, we will all know why. Vote NO
So are you going to live up to your word? Or will that bribe inserted by the GOP shame your conscience?
Reminder: Murkowski told me last month she didn't want a polar payoff, she wanted a plan that works for USA. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/gop-health-bill-steers-cash-to-home-state-of-reluctant-senator …
@SenatorCollins @SenCapito @joniernst @SenatorFischer vote NO on AHCA
Say NO! to the bribes. When you go to church on Sunday, go with a clear conscience: you didn't vote to kill your constituents. #VoteNoBCRA
Save our HC-vote no!!!
MILLIONS of Americans are counting on YOU to make their lives better, not worse.  The bill is still an atrocity.  VOTE NO.
Please stay the course and VOTE NO. The new plan is not good, and we'll go back 15 years, if not worse, with this plan.
Medicare is not unsustainable. This is just another Koch concession. Tons of countries have figured this out, but Kochs don't want it here.
ACA is NOT collapsing. It's a lie. Fund CSR's/other comps, and then fix it. Move forward, not back. VOTE NO
Surely you can't turn your back on your constituents like this. Please vote no.
Please vote no to this healthcare bill!  Millions of lives depend on it!  Fix the ACA!
Please vote NO on the ACA repeal and replace bill.  PLEASE !!   #VoteNoBCRA
Hoping you are with Collins on this one. Much respect if you do!

Senate bill has a bucket o' cash for Alaska, home of holdout Senator Lisa Murkowski.

Shouldn't ALL Alaskans be healthy enough to experience life to its fullest? Vote NO on #BCRA! #ProtectOurCare #StayStrongLisa 99501 
people shouldn't have to ask you to allow them to stay alive to enjoy similar memories like yours here. #VOTENOBCRA
VOTE NO- this GOP plan is a nightmare
#TBT to when Alaskans didn't have to worry that #Medicaid would be ripped away. Older Alaskans get the worst deal in USA. PLEASE #NoBCRA
This week you and @SenatorCollins will be the backstop to #Medicaid #Medicare hits that so many in our state rely on.
I thank you for understanding that and rising above your peers. Keep up the good work!
verses acting like spoiled children. You are role models for your constituents. 4
I thank you and applaud your diligence. Politicians need to start acting like adults and work together across the isle 3
We need to get healthcare right and not pass something for the sake of undoing what's wrong. 2
Thank you for standing up for Alaskans, even when it's opposing to your party. 1
Vote no on this horrible health bill
Please vote no.  So many depend upon your good judgement.
Vote No on Mitch's deathcare bill.  Work with Dems for bipartisan fix to ACA & call it whatever the heck you want  or blood is on your hands
Awesome. Love Halibut! Would also love u to take a stand against BCRA. Access to worthless plans & plans we can't afford does not =  freedom
Americans aren't falling for Cruz's #FakeFreedom con. 71% now favor a bipartisan effort to improve ACA. #VoteNoBCRA
Please vote no to protect vulnerable citizens.
While others sleep on the street, you reap the b enifits of a Kings Life. #EvilPoliticians
It's official. Even under new bill, MEDICAID will be GUTTED. Vote no or you're a monster.
BREAKING: New GOP health care bill slashes Medicaid, eliminates insurance mandate http://nbcnews.to/2tQLjEa  
Beyond disgusting to post these photos when there is a bill that will decimate Medicaid & kick millions off of health insurance.
We just saw the bribe McConnell put in the new bill. Don't take it! Think about the rest of the country please!
You're being bribed. You're an evil monster. Vote NO on both versions or you have blood on your hands
Wow. The bill includes a Polar Payoff for Murkowski. https://twitter.com/hannah_recht/status/885531731109056512 …
Look how small the halibut are. The Bay is failing, clams, crab, they are disappearing...
Jared Kushner has a security clearance despite request for a secret back channel to the Kremlin. How many agent lives are at risk?
Senator, the lives of children are at stake with your vote on healthcare.  Please reassure voters that you will not let them down.  Vote No!
I'm sure your constituents appreciate your spending the summer here in DC instead of in Alaska. It couldn't be more dissimilar.
Nice. Now please ensure 24 million Americans keep their health care.
I absolutely cannot believe you are posting fishing photos when thousands of AK lives are on the line. Disgusting. Show courage #VoteNoBCRA
Here come the bribes
I expect @SenDanSullivan to take the blood money with no shame. I hope that @lisamurkowski shows a little more scruples. We shall see.
Why hasn't Kushner been forced to resign?
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
This veteran is doing whatever she can to protect her son from the Republican health care bill
