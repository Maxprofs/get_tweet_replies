The matter at hand us healthcare.. where do you stand senator?
Really am surprised she is the last to state her position. McCain came out, Collins came out. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Christ.
If I were to hazard a guess, she wants the bill to go away with the three existing no votes so she doesn't piss off GOP more than she has
But Rand Paul can't be trusted.
Agreed. He would vote yes if it came to a vote. I think McConnell will not put it to a vote because he doesn't want to be humiliated again
True- he did get humiliated last night down in Alabama. Good Grief our country is falling apart. I'm scared to death!!
Vote no!
True Leaders have the courage of their convictions senator
Please fight to keep Affordable Care!...Now and in the future!
Vote "no" on GrahamCassidy.  Are you really going to be bought off by money for Alaska, easily taken away after the vote?
What the status on State Department noms, particularly those with N. Korean experience?
dear Senator..pls find ppl who want and believe in the jobs/USA and r competent not like Pruitt, price, Devos and Sessions
Please vote NO on Graham Cassidy!
Cool but uh that other thing.....
Make sure they will not lay to waste Alaska's beauty. Once lost you cannot get it back
When are ethics coming back?
Please vote NO on Graham/Cassidy. Thank you.
Support the President's agenda including Republican health care
Please #VoteNo on #GrahamCassidy Every single person in America under GrahamCassidy has a preexisting condition #protectourcare #saveourcare
I ask you the same. Please vote NO
I sure hope they are better qualified than Zinke and DeVos. I'm horrified by attempts to shrink public lands.
These twitter adds piss of all your constituents. Traitor
Alaska is one of our most beautiful states. I am sure Alaskans are interested in keeping it so- clean energy!
Thank you for all you do
Vote NO, please !
Are you voting NO on Graham Cassidy? Is winning more important than Americans health? Is your tweet just an effort to distract? And Korea!?
No I get you're waiting so the right-wing nut jobs can't attack you as harshly.
I am SO worried about healthcare.  I didn't have insurance for 12 yrs bcs of preexisting. The ACA saved my life - blessed to have it!!
Nice dodge
Please put on hold and send the troupes to Puerto Rico. Trumps lost. They need US to save them. Now

We need you to publicly say you don't support Graham Cassidy. We need to work on bipartisan HC legislation and we need to get aid to PR
Senator, hate to nag but would you state that you are a hard “no”. Bill is wrong, period. We need to work on real solutions.

Oh hi, Lisa. Nice to hear from you. Speaking of healthcare, RU now in favor of killing Medicaid bc UR so quiet...
BREAKING: Avalere: Alaska, Ohio, and West Virginia still lose $$ -- even with the multiple Polar Payoffs. 
Really? You refuse to take a stand on this? Scared to hold yourself accountable?
"I don't believe we are going to have a vote," Sen. Murkowski says on health care, declining to reveal her position, per @SunlenSerfaty
