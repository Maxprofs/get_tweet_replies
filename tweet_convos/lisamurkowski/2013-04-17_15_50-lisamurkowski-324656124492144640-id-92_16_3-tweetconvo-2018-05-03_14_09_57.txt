@lisamurkowski That sounds overblown. Please explain this point.
@lobsternoob And the police are already background checked, are they not?
@lobsternoob Try insulting less, if you truly wish to have a discussion. If you're here just to be rude, take it elsewhere.
@lisamurkowski Is ignorance a requirement for public officials in Alaska? Tell the truth. @MomsDemand #lackofleadership
@lisamurkowski Maybe with a police officer shot and killed tonight you could shut up about guns? Tonight?
@lisamurkowski <-- Big #FAIL
@lisamurkowski  #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per dead child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction
@lisamurkowski Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? Coward 4 hire. #DemandAction
#NRA threatened @lisamurkowski w election backlash.But NRA's #GOP candidates R losing.Shebetrayed dead 1st graders 4nothing. #DemandAction
@lisamurkowski O, incovenience to gun collectors, of course! But-it is a TAD more inconvenient for parents to bury a child. So there's that.
.@lisamurkowski Liar. M-T wouldn't have prevented private sales or even req'd background checks for them.
@lisamurkowski I've got the text of the bill right here, which section says that?
@lisamurkowski (Hint: It does not say that.)
@lisamurkowski dont solve your states problem by condeming 40000 americans to death every year. http://WWW.THEYDONTWORKFORYOU.ORG 
@lisamurkowski you failed gun violence victims EVERYWHERE. Don't blame us next mass shooting. We tried to warn you
@lisamurkowski WHEN does ur BS tank read "full"? You are turning the GOP Into an endangered species. Congrats. --signed, former R voter
@lisamurkowski Please explain this statement?  its simply a lie.  And disgusting that you would spread such false information!
@lisamurkowski Please vote for what Americans want, not the NRA. Background checks!
@lisamurkowski Lisa, that's a lie and you know it. You lie to cover the massive funding you get from the #NRA. We are not fooled.
@BrettaApplebaum
@DarrenSumo Fuck you, Asswipe.
@BrettaApplebaum Thank you so much for your generous offer, but I'll have to take a pass. #RedNationRising
@lisamurkowski oh what an inconvenience. Tell that to the families of #Newtown Shame on you #coward
@lisamurkowski Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski A plane ticket to where? Are you saying all Alaskans would fail a background check when it becomes mandatory?
@lisamurkowski Shame on you. #RememberNewtown
@lisamurkowski Let's compare - Cost of a plane tix...cost of child's life.  What's wrong with this picture?
@lisamurkowski nah there are already enough guns in ur state to last a lifetime. #guncontrol
@lisamurkowski You are a coward and a liar. You placed the comforts of your office above your country and the safety of its citizens.
@lisamurkowski Law-abiding is what the NRA paid you to say, isn’t it. Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski For shame. Remember the 90%.
@lisamurkowski then move the fuck out of Alaska, dipshits.
@lisamurkowski thr ws a episode on Wild West Guns AK & the owner ws tld he cld not mk his new gun unless its N AZ is this wht UR talking abt
@lisamurkowski you have blood on tour hands! Every time someone is killed u will have to wonder if you are partly to blame
@lisamurkowski It is too easy for criminals to get guns. http://nyti.ms/17215tM   You voted against the American people. #demandaplan
@lisamurkowski  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@lisamurkowski Umm, ur not a law abiding citizen if if u've broken a law which would prevent u from owning a gun, u selfish coward.
@lisamurkowski received $4,500 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2010. http://ow.ly/kaOwC  #NRALapdogs
@lisamurkowski No longer buying your twisted tales of truth! How could a woman vote to allow crazy people to slaughter innocent children?
@lisamurkowski If that's true, which I doubt, work with the authors of the bill to improve it. Don't just pretend there isn't a gun problem.
@lisamurkowski there are more ppl living in Cleveland than all of Alaska. And that's what won out for you on this issue? Really?!
@lisamurkowski even if this were true, most Alaskans aren't lacking in the gun dept. and certainly this trumps the lives of the rest of us?!
@lisamurkowski Instead, you voted to let others buy caskets for their children. #SHAME
@lisamurkowski 93% of gun households, 89% of Republicans & 85% of NRA member households support universal background checks. #badatyourjob
@lisamurkowski u're out of touch with reality. Alaska's so far out, u should at least vote to consider the more applicable mainlanders
@lisamurkowski liar. You're as bad as Palin. And even if that's true..the inconvenience is not worth the lives it would save?
“@lisamurkowski: Under Manchin-Toomey, thousands of law-abiding Alaskans would have had to buy a plane ticket to buy a gun.”

Lmao
@lisamurkowski Shame on you
@lisamurkowski Because what we need is more and more guns. What are you talking about?
@lisamurkowski You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@lisamurkowski I'm sickened by the senate vote on gun laws, but especially disgusted by women who won't protect children. Sellout.
@lisamurkowski You are shameful. People before lobby. ALWAYS!
@lisamurkowski Utter fiction. You are a disgrace.
@lisamurkowski Dead children don't vote. Nor contribute to campaigns. But I'm curious: Did it EVER occur to you to do the right thing?
@lisamurkowski BS! A woman who enables children 2b murdered. U voted no for 1 reason, the NRA paid u to. Hope u can get the blood off the $
@lisamurkowski Thanks for voting no on gun control. Let's keep it about Crime control.
@lisamurkowski Victory for real Americans today! Can't even find a lot of guns and bullets because Obama and his buddies caused a panic!
@lisamurkowski And 4 the safety of Americans at-large, only law enforcement officials shld be allowed 2 carry weapons on planes
@lisamurkowski Thanks for voting for the NRA and the gun manufacturers today against the overwhelming will of the people. SHAME SHAME SHAME
@lisamurkowski WHAT?! Shame on you.
@lisamurkowski so what? You're a douchebag.
@lisamurkowski You let Sandy Hook kids die in vain, and Moms will do whatever it takes to defeat you. #MomsAreWatching #MomsDemandAction
@lisamurkowski you are a disgrace.
@lisamurkowski How many people have to die before you say it's too much? Do not be proud of this vote Shame on you
@lisamurkowski You lie. You are a lying liar. A liar!
@lisamurkowski No they wouldn’t have to by an air ticket to buy a gun, a military grade weapon maybe, but not a hunting rifle or shotgun.
@lisamurkowski What about the people who have to buy plane tickets to attend a funeral of a loved one??? #pathetic #shame #bloodonyourhands
@lisamurkowski Good for you senator.  You did the right thing for your folks.
@lisamurkowski I don't understand. Say what? Please explain your tweet.
.@lisamurkowski Or they could have gotten a bush order from a store in Anchorage, with a background check.  Don't bullshit us, Lisa.
@lisamurkowski I was disappointed with today's vote, but I would hope some concessions could be brought in for Alaskans.
@lisamurkowski hope that helps you sleep better tonight.
@lisamurkowski When did Alaskan's become heartless?  When I lived there people had compassion. Of course, ppl did vote for Palin.
@lisamurkowski as shown here, lying is allowed on Twitter.
@lisamurkowski Explain why.  You should, you know, because most of us don't simply trust what any politician says anyhow.
@lisamurkowski Good. Have them do that. I lived in Ak for 18 yrs. Traveled a lot to get what I wanted. Your buddy Sarah flys when she shoots
@lisamurkowski under current rule no problem for criminals even Mexico made in Texas sold in Texas used in Mexico.
@lisamurkowski Keep trying to cover your butt with lies. We know what you are. POLITICAL COWARD.
@lisamurkowski Great vote, Senator. Thank you. Hope you resist the pressure on Rubio's immigration boondoggle as well.
@lisamurkowski Boy, 2 fer 2! BTW, thanks heaps for the GMOs!
@lisamurkowski Oh please cry me a frozen river. #NoJusticeNoPeace
@lisamurkowski It is easier to buy a gun in this state than to get health care.
@lisamurkowski Boo-hoo
@lisamurkowski So how does it feel to bought and paid for by the NRA?
@lisamurkowski You are a bold face lair!
@lisamurkowski better that than psychos purchasing them on Craigslist and eBay!
@lisamurkowski Oh what garbage.How does it feel to go against 90% of Americans. You know sometimes it is about more than just Alaska. #fail
@lisamurkowski Thank you !
@lisamurkowski I have to buy a plane ticket to buy Taco Bell.  So what?
@lisamurkowski That is just nonsense.  #fearmongering
