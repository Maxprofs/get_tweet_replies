Alaskans enraged by @lisamurkowski's vote FOR Trump appointee #DeVos can call her LOCAL office via mobile here:
- As a mom & former teacher, both charter & State Univ., SO DISAPPOINTED at @lisamurkowski decision. @phoneyourrep
I hope Alaskans vote her out. This isn't the first time @lisamurkowski has betrayed Progressives and Democrats. @phoneyourrep
This should've been a no-brainer. It's a non-partisan vote. It's about our kids.
Lisa Murkowski has 6 district offices. If you're not getting through, try another one.
Thank you!!
If u are wavering on your vote for #DeVos, u should abstain or vote no. As teacher/mother, please #DumpDeVos
Education is a non-partisan issue & privatizing it puts focus on the $$, instead of the kids.
- please hear the people.  We are opposed to Betsy DeVos as Sec of Education.  Vote your conscience.
Betsy broke you also
- How could you do this ?!!  You knew DeVos wasn't qualified and did it anyway.  A sad day in America. Alaskans won't forget
why does it matter if they contact you? You still voted for DeVos even when 1000s called and came to tell you no. #yuck
@LovelyLowEnd @lisamurkowski these republicans care more about imposing beliefs than listening to people.
she proved that today with the lot of them. #VoteThemOut
You better confirm secretary of education or you life as a politician is going to be short.
please dump DeVos! We are counting on you!

American children deserve a better education than one under clueless Devos.  Should never have approved nomination.
I can't lead a school without necessary certification. The same should be expected of who leads our country's education dept.
Party over country. Very sad, Sen. Murkowski #StopDevos
Your constituents have overwhelmingly opposed DeVos and you voted for her anyway. You are a disgrace. Bought and sold.
no DeVos- like allowing a pacifist to lead the military or atheist to lead a church; their goal would be subversive.#noDevos
