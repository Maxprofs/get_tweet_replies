@SpeakerBoehner get busy getting 2/3rd override. would be first thing you ever accomplished. pass the gavel to Ted Cruz,a real leader
@randadtrade @SpeakerBoehner oh sweet lord. Cruz??  I just threw up in my mouth.
@mariaromito @SpeakerBoehner gargle and die and get out of the way of real america then.
@randadtrade @SpeakerBoehner wow. I feel sorry for you so hateful. I'll say a prayer.
@mariaromito @SpeakerBoehner get out of the way or be run over. we are taking this country back.
@randadtrade @mariaromito @SpeakerBoehner you're delusional. Enjoy your 2 years in the sun! 2016 not looking pretty for RWNJs.
@SpeakerBoehner @GodSaveAmerica1 John please stop talking..Resign..you are not man enough to led the House!
 "@SpeakerBoehner: Retweet if you agree: There's no excuse – scientific or otherwise – for the president to continue blocking #KeystoneXL.”
@raininblack @SpeakerBoehner I giggle at how few RTs it actually got.
@CJCreggConcanon @SpeakerBoehner he can never get enough votes or RTs 
@SpeakerBoehner P.S. This may work with your low IQ following but it won't fly with the informed.

By the way, you're an idiot.
@SpeakerBoehner There are lots if excuses to prevent Keystone you paid for stooge
@SpeakerBoehner isn't it a true conflict of interest with your personal financial investment in #KeystoneXL?
.@SpeakerBoehner And what will you do when Barack Obama vetoes the Keystone pipeline?.........Crickets......Nothing.
@GovtsTheProblem @SpeakerBoehner I am waiting on that.
@SpeakerBoehner There's no reason for you to support it, and why are you blocking passage of the jobs bill?
@SpeakerBoehner wrong side of history you are. The younger generations will have to deal with the mess this brings.
@emiliana @SpeakerBoehner Truth vs #foxnewsfacts
@SpeakerBoehner I don't agree. It's irresponsible and short term thinking
@OhioIntellect @ShortThink @SpeakerBoehner I utterly disagree with you. The pipeline is not economically sound & will ruin the environment
@SpeakerBoehner The jobs argument for the XL is basically a sick joke coming from people who have done all they can to destroy American jobs
@SpeakerBoehner @GodSaveAmerica1 Obama will block Keystone because Buffet will lose out on $2 billion per year hauling crude on BNSF.
@SpeakerBoehner : I thought you supported him in everything.. Against your party's wishes
@SpeakerBoehner asking ppl to retweet if they agree with your personal version of reality is idiotic. Of course more dirty oil=more CO2
@SpeakerBoehner no reason to approve. Whose agenda is this?  Someone lining your pockets?
@SpeakerBoehner well there is this thing called over riding a veto. Why not try that?
@mnix49mn @SpeakerBoehner Please, the founding fathers wouldn't have had a president in the first place if congress could override any veto
@DougKopec you're not the sharpest knife in the drawer
@GlockYouToSleep Youre sharper, huh? K, take your best shot.
@DougKopec lookin at your pic u look like u stand exactly 501ft outside of school zones & hand free candy out to lil kids.. @GlockYouToSleep
@Thin_Diesel @DougKopec @GlockYouToSleep In 2008 Congress over rides Pres. Bush veto on medicare. Best shot and Winning! !!!!!
@SpeakerBoehner @JrJacktown It is a no brainier ($$) why BHO is trying to sabotage employment and oil it helps ISIS
@Bubblesjim @SpeakerBoehner @JrJacktown Why care what it will cost? Oil not for US, but rather China. Fresh H2O unimportant? Ridiculous
@SpeakerBoehner Retweet if you agree: the earth is flat! #TurtlesAllTheWayDown!
@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner there is NO JOBS, only 35 and BIG OIL WINS BIG, you are a LIAR!
@SpeakerBoehner NO to #KeystoneXL Even British Columbis said NO
There's no reason-except Corruption& Fraud-that bought off Traitor scum like you-who funded Obamas crime-are still in office-@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner The oil Canada doesn't want in their country? That stuff they want to dump on us? The stuff to make you & the Kochs more $?
@SpeakerBoehner So US taxpayers will pay to build a pipeline so private for profit corp. can move their product to market. #boughtandpaidfor
@SpeakerBoehner CANNOT DO SO AS LONG AS YOU IGNORE RESULTS/REASON FOR RECENT ELECTION. YOU DIDN'T WIN ON CHARM & GOOD LOOKS!
@SpeakerBoehner Why, because you have investment$ in it? You invested wrong, the future is now.
@SpeakerBoehner keystone, All this fight for another country pipeline thru the USA and no tax revenue! Am I wrong?
@SpeakerBoehner retweet if you agree...there's no excuse for those that voted for Boehner as speaker.
@SpeakerBoehner  Republicans don’t have a jobs agenda, or much an economic vision in general, but they have a Keystone bill.
@SpeakerBoehner no excuses just facts! #nodirtyoil
@SpeakerBoehner I call BS, 35 perm jobs? They sell to the highest bidder the US does not benefit, your pocket might tho
@SpeakerBoehner NOT ABOUT JOBS:
@SpeakerBoehner GOP is supposed to lower taxes not raise them! No new GAS TAXES! Listen up for once!
@SpeakerBoehner The fact that it won't benefit normal Americans at all. How much do stand to lose on your investment #weepingcheeto?
@SpeakerBoehner - the President is right!
@SpeakerBoehner Except economists say it would be a waste of money and not put that many people to work #NoKXL
@SpeakerBoehner You mean besides American's not wanting it? #NoKXL
@SpeakerBoehner When has the GOP been buddies with Science? Pardon us sane folks for not buying what you're selling. #JohnnyWalkerOrange
@SpeakerBoehner How much did you sell you vote for?  There is no reason to even have the trash in US brooders #NoKeystoneXL !
@SpeakerBoehner give one good reason why PBO SHOULDN'T block it (that isn't about your lobbyists or portfolio).
@SpeakerBoehner ask your grandchildren and they can tell you plenty about the environmental science you deny exist
@SpeakerBoehner have you listened to any scientific reasoning?
“@SpeakerBoehner: There's no excuse – scientific or otherwise – for the president to continue blocking #KeystoneXL.” Bro, do u even science?
@SpeakerBoehner Lacking all "scientific or otherwise" evidence & critical thinking skills is the only way you fucking dipshits do business.
.@SpeakerBoehner: Retweet if you agree: no excuse – scientific or otherwise – to blocking #KeystoneXL.
What to do disagree? Sellout our kids
@SpeakerBoehner It's not US oil. It's a global pipe line. It isn't fucking worth it. We're addicted to oil & need to stop sooner or later.
@SpeakerBoehner only 35 permanent jobs... A lot of money for your donors in a poor oil market.
@SpeakerBoehner If you say that's it's OK, to cram it down the throats of Native Americans, over their Lands. You would be very very wrong.
@SpeakerBoehner try climate science, economic facts, native people's land rights... Who's making $ off of this? Who does it benefit? #NoKXL
RT if u think @SpeakerBoehner @lisamurkowski should listen to the American people and not move fwd with keystone pipeline
@SpeakerBoehner @lisamurkowski With oil under $50 and good jobs numbers is there any reason to build it?
@SpeakerBoehner Oil coming out of Canada is some of the most corrosive oil out there! That's why Canada won't build it through their country
@SpeakerBoehner His excuse is no different than your excuse to pass bloated budget in closed door way.U DC politicians want $ for campaigns.
@SpeakerBoehner KP provides 44k temp jobs total for a few mos. Texas will absorb all the pollution. After refining, oil goes to high bidder.
@SpeakerBoehner this country needs to do some serious re evaluating..
@SpeakerBoehner there are many reason to veto it you just do not understand science
Retweet if you agree: There's no excuse for @SpeakerBoehner to still be in office. No to #KeystoneXL. Yes to #PlanetEarth.
@SpeakerBoehner Except that the House won't do anything cause they are scared of a shutdown.
@SpeakerBoehner DEFINITELY, agreed! YK
@SpeakerBoehner 35 jobs permanent jobs will be created so Canada can ship their filthy oil overseas. How does that help the American people
@SpeakerBoehner Just as there is no excuse for you removing Webster and Nugent from the rules committee!!
@SpeakerBoehner @lisamurkowski Wrong. Keystone is not needed and is bad.
@SpeakerBoehner lmfao you are looking to science?  What about global warming,  or do you just pick and choose? Earth,  flat or sphere?
@Raven_4hm @SpeakerBoehner Definitively flat.
@SpeakerBoehner Return the 100 million you got from Trans Canada because its DOA!
@SpeakerBoehner @lisamurkowski   wrong.  you are wrong.  #blockkeystonexl
@SpeakerBoehner @lisamurkowski Sorry but 35 permanent jobs isn't worth it. Nor is the pursuit of fossil fuels. http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/10/van-jones/cnns-van-jones-says-keystone-pipeline-only-creates/ … #KXL
@SpeakerBoehner agree=this is one giant move we can make to continue to be energy independent from countries that dont like us. sign it pres
.@SpeakerBoehner @lisamurkowski KXL will enrich Canada oil & Koch while we take all risks! POTUS'AJA will fix infrastructure,employ way more
@SpeakerBoehner There are many more important issues for the America People than #Congress wasting their time debating the #KeystoneXL.
@SpeakerBoehner Nice try, you sociopath. #RenewUI
@SpeakerBoehner Cuz we really need Canadian oil shipped thru our heartland to foreign countries, John.....
@SpeakerBoehner What kind of Bonus are you getting if it passes?
@SpeakerBoehner His environmentalism isn't about science - it's a religion.
@SpeakerBoehner #  you are overlooking one thing  he is A liberal America comes last ?
@SpeakerBoehner What about the 34 jobs it will create?
@SpeakerBoehner Retweet if you agree: There's no excuse that you're still Speaker. #embarrassment
@SpeakerBoehner It's your Libra Moon. All Libra Moons are squishes.

@SpeakerBoehner False. It won't help the economy & only benefits ppl like the #KochBros. It is also an environmental disaster.
@SpeakerBoehner http://www.fws.gov/midwest/twincities/enbridge.htm …
@SpeakerBoehner #KeystoneXL will only benefit="TransCanada,Canadian oilCo.(manyPart-ownedByChinese&MideastInterests)"
@SpeakerBoehner #KeystoneXL ="mayKillMoreUSJobsThanCreates", pipelineSpills,addit.FuelCosts,environmentalConsequences
@SpeakerBoehner  You need to check your facts not your checkbook. This pipeline doesn't help Americans the way you want to believe it will.
@SpeakerBoehner since you don't believe in science or math, there's no logical reason you support it.   Oh wait....$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ #BigOil
@SpeakerBoehner It's pretty sick that a foreign nation has bribed you to support their oil industry!
@SpeakerBoehner PLEASE, Tell Me That's A MisTweet. No Scientific -Excuse-???
Sir: May I Introduce You To Dr. Kaku...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbjPQisjyfM …
@SpeakerBoehner no no no no no
@SpeakerBoehner isn't really just about con interests, railroads and like investors?
@speakerboehner retweet if u agree Boehner is a criminal scumbag for pushing #KeystoneXL so his investments in Tar-sands corps make millions
@SpeakerBoehner It is dangerous and will not produce any jobs. You are an idiot if you say otherwise.
@SpeakerBoehner Hypocrites http://www.salon.com/2015/01/09/the_gops_latest_job_creation_lie_stunning_hypocrisy_in_the_keystone_pipeline_crusade/ …
@SpeakerBoehner I can think of millions of reasons for @BarackObama to reject #KXL: future generations of all species. You care only for $$$
@SpeakerBoehner Repeal nixon's DEA EXECUTIVE ORDER BANKRUPTING US w/aPRISON CULTURE, if u TRULY want to do something POSITIVE for our nation
@SpeakerBoehner US citizens want to protect our natural resources=NOT  #KeystoneXL http://www.nwf.org/What-We-Do/Energy-and-Climate/Drilling-and-Mining/Tar-Sands/Keystone-XL-Pipeline.aspx …
@SpeakerBoehner @PolitiFact: #KeystoneXLPipeline CREATES 35 jobs, 4900 temporary jobs Nationwide http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/10/van-jones/cnns-van-jones-says-keystone-pipeline-only-creates/ …  @GOP #GOP #Retweet
@SpeakerBoehner There is certainly no reason for him to approve the keystone
@SpeakerBoehner He hasN'T blocked it even once. @WeGotEd @TheDemocrats
@SpeakerBoehner there plenty of reason- the environment. No more dirty oil. Create jobs through alternative energy.
@SpeakerBoehner TAX REFORM--JOBS BILL(bridges&such)-start there--health care has been a huge problem way before obama- action was needed
@SpeakerBoehner If #KeystoneXL gets passed, a #TeaPotDome style hearing is in order
@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner Actually more concerned about Obamacare immigration, and that 1T dollar budget All greater threats to jobs and our country
@SpeakerBoehner doesn't appear to be able to do simple addition. Canadian shale oil cost over $65/b to produce but the market price is $50/b
@SpeakerBoehner I THINK OF FRACKING AND CANCER AND THE WATER--LIKE PA
@SpeakerBoehner there is no excuse for not repealing obamacare
@SpeakerBoehner For the love of pete, don't you guys keep up with science at all, or just bought and paid for by corporate interests??
@SpeakerBoehner why should the government finance a pipeline to serve private oil companies? Isn't that socialism?
@SpeakerBoehner if you think keystone takes property away from Americans to give it to foreign companies RT this.

http://thinkbig.us/ideas/19863/ 
@SpeakerBoehner KXL risks the aquifer that ensures the midwest can grow food @ risk & provides few jobs 2 US & no oil. All risk, no benefit.
@SpeakerBoehner Even the CANADIANS don't want it anymore!! It's no longer commercially viable. They would have to sell the oil at a LOSS!!
@SpeakerBoehner  #KeystoneXL
Yes there is. We don't need the oil. Let Canada run the dirty tar sand oil across their country.
Boehner Says Hurts when Called 'Spineless' http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/boehner-hurts-called-spineless-squish/story?id=28088659 … YOU'RE A SPINELESS DRUNK, let RWNJ's run asylum! YOU SUCK @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner There's no excuse for devils like YOU who don't believe in fucking science! #FuckTheGOP
@SpeakerBoehner Just the first of many issues He will attempt to Govern on His Own...
@SpeakerBoehner why would we want to ruin our country to ship Canadas dirty oil??
@SpeakerBoehner what if I disagree?
@SpeakerBoehner
Guess this won't get rted much, huh?
How much did #KeystoneXL pay @SpeakerBoehner for this tweet?

US$250,000,000
@SpeakerBoehner no excuse for you funding Obama's ILLEGALS Obama care drop dead you SORRY SON OF A BITCH whore basterd
@SpeakerBoehner # need to find a way to remove him from office !!!
@SpeakerBoehner Yes because frack wells only last a few years and oil prices WILL shoot back up
@DougKopec @SpeakerBoehner Prices Will Fly Back Up Because WE, The People Will Pay For The Refinery Renovations Needed To Process TarGunk
@SpeakerBoehner I'm in!
@SpeakerBoehner fuck you boner
@SpeakerBoehner But he will. So do you have enough votes to override it? No? Then stop tweeting and get to work.
@SpeakerBoehner TEMP JOBS, 40 PERMANENT JOBS, DIRTY OIL CANADA SELLING TO WORLD!!  GOP LIES, YOU ARE AN AMERICAN TRAITOR!
@SpeakerBoehner Will you be my overly tanned dad?
@SpeakerBoehner 1) It's called the environment and green house gases that will add to global warming 2) cause gas prices to rise.
@SpeakerBoehner agreed
@SpeakerBoehner why so much effort to create 50 jobs?
@SpeakerBoehner how about you knock off the XL grandstanding and take a public position AGAINST a new gasoline tax !!!!
@DividendMaster @SpeakerBoehner new gas tax when oil prices are falling. That seems logical #not
@SpeakerBoehner how about an environmental excuse? That's the most important one!
@SpeakerBoehner John your WRONG! Its not american oil. Its a fraud and great deception what the GOP is doing and the DNC should be ashamed.
