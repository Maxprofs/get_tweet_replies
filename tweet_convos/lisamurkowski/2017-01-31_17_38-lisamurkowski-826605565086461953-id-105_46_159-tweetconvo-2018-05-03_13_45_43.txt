TRUMP VOTERS ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION!!?? MY FELLOW LONG ISLANDERS- I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!!
- Yeah, but you failed Sec of Educ nominee, so you're only 50% conservative!
Do you say that because you've been bought by BIG business. It's definitely not what the people want.
@SenateGOP @POTUS #Fail #Deflection
pleased with Supreme Court pick?! Really?? Fascist much! Stay on the right side of hx like u did with Devos.
Not the point. It's a stolen seat.
did you support garland? oh thats right no hearing no vote. i support the dems in witholding.
@SenateGOP @POTUS you are not listening to the american people
@SenateGOP @POTUS @SenateMajLdr #MerrickGarland was robbed Mitch changed the rules & now doesn't like them ? #toobadsosad
Any concerns re: his stand women's right 2 choose (keep US out of women's private decisions) & his early devotion to fascism?
also, did you receive contributions from the NEA in 02? I just want to make sure I know who is pulling the strings
oppose DeVos, stand up for public education.
Yeah  public education results are so embarrassing when compared with other countries
Vote NO to Gorsuch! Investigate his past! Gorsuch both created and headed the "Fascism Forever Club
@SenateGOP @POTUS Why bother? Trump's going to ram him down our throats with his 'going nuclear' threat. Welcome home 1950.
Who are you kidding? A SCOTUS judge cannot help you on our "issues". Inappropriate.
Check out all the #Hillary voters on this thread begging Murkowski to vote no on #Davos
14,000 Hillary Clinton supporters like her announcement. We should work that hard trolling them.
@SenateGOP @POTUS omg
Democrats should block the nomination of Neil Gorsuch!
too bad. You LOST!
You are fucking stupid!
@SenateGOP @POTUS just like you met with #MerrickGarland
needs to be reminded that we the people expect her to support @POTUS   Cabinet picks, unless she wants a new job soon #Trump
He knows you're a traitor.
@SenateGOP @POTUS 
Few Recall Gorsuch’s Volunteer Work at Harvard https://www.wsj.com/articles/few-recall-gorsuchs-volunteer-work-at-harvard-1486342894 …
#Maddow
it certainly wouldn't be the people who elected you to represent them, right? It's all about who signs the checks, isn't it?
honest engine time. Is the NEA threatening your seat? Or do you really believe gov't has done a good job w/ education?
.@lisamurkowski @POTUS
I am more concerned of Putin’s control of Trump!
I am sad that patriotic Senators are turning blind eye!
@SenateGOP @POTUS A great choice!
@SenateGOP @POTUS
@SenateGOP @POTUS you should have the backbone to vote for Ms DeVos, shame.
Maybe @SarahPalinUSA  can take your place in the future! You're corrupt!
@SenateGOP @POTUS The outlook for America and its patriotic Citizens are Looking better everyday!!
@SenateGOP @POTUS Tell @lisamurkowski to get her head out of her ass of Devos and get with the program. We want school choice.
#DTS
@SenateGOP @POTUS Disappointed you're not backing Betsy DeVos.
you meant #USA Constitution issues? 

Hopefully.
should have had at least one hearing on Merrick Garland
I urge you to support DeVos. Public education is lacking-see Chicago PS as evidence-sucks up much $$ with few results.
that's because you're shameless and hate yourself.
Approve DeVos!
Oh DRAT!!!  Just when I thought I could support a member of the GOP!
Thank you for standing up against Betsy Devos nomination and for keeping our children safe
I don't think he should get confirmation hearings until merrick garland gets his.
thats nice but your vote against Betsy says to me you are a rino and don't understand education at all. Shame on you.
get on board with Devos you're supposed to be voting with your party get off the lobbyist dime
as a woman I am terrified of losing my abortion rights
Please don't chip away at the separation of church & state! He voted against birth control based on religion!
Are senators supposed to be meeting with Supreme Court justices to discuss "issues"? #SeparationOfPowers
. Please please please vote no to Betsy DeVos. Your hearing remarks showed me you know what you should do. Please do it!
Lisa......Your Fired!
Stand with Trump on B.Devos vote! @GOP @McConnellPress @SenJohnMcCain @GrahamBlog #StandWithTrump NOW!
Really? So u agree w anti  and anti women's reproductive choices? Ok. We will remember. The base will move on. Bye
This is the WRONG decision for supreme court... women's heath and LGBTQ rights are in danger. You've failed us, again
Employers don't belong in people's bedrooms or interfering in birth control access or decisions.
You get to that?
Are selling out your kids education for $$ not qualifications
no no no!
@adndotcom  Alaska Dispatch, Lisa Murkowski does not care what Alaskans think. Voicemail box still full.
no!
Would have been good for you to respect a president's right to appoint Merrick Garland too.
seriously???? Wish I could take my vote for you back
as an Alaskan resident and voter I urge u 2 not support Gorsuch for Supreme Court.
Vote No on DeVos, Sessions, and Gorsuch to protect all Americans! They do not represent the best we have to offer!
No! Gorsuch will vote in favor of corporations, against civil and reproductive rights. Oppose his confirmation!
well at least you're taking a position. Will you still support Gorsuch if he hurts #women, #LGBTQ, & #CivilRights?
just selling out your constituents left and right? Shame
so nice for you that YOUR basic rights won't be endangered by his decisions. #checkyourpriviledge
Who's basic rights?! Everyones?! No one will be endangered by his decisions?! Oh noo!!
kiss your hope of equality goodbye. Gorsuch is more right than Scalia.
won't forget your vote for DeVos, you betrayed education today

Very little teaching goes on. Kids need other options desperately. Most teachers send their kids to private schools.
Im a democrat who voted for Trump. Inner city schools are a mess and very dangerous places
As a Trump supported and a former public school administrator, I ask that you vote to confirm Ms Devos.
please do NOT fovte for DeVos tomorrow. we are counting on you!
you just throw my kids education away. I'm not sure how you can sleep at night.
we aren't pleased that you sent #grotesquelyunqualified @BetsyDeVos to the senate. #shameful #noDevos
#resist No Way
You must vote no to Gorsuch.
Finally, someone who has sense... Thank you
beg u to vote against Gorsuch as he will affect lives of our daughters&elderly terminally ill for generations 2 come
polluting the planet?
He is not for #EqualRights must be blocked for 1,450 days.
Well, there goes that. Any lberal who hoped @lisamurkowski might side with them on Gorsuch have just had that quickly evaporated
@alaskadispatch @adndotcom everyone should Google "Betsy Devos political contributions" and see @lisamurkowski 's name everywhere! Vote NO!
Do you have any interest in what Alaskans think? Or do you never plan to empty your voicemail again?
I'm thinking she probably doesn't want to hear from us. If she did, she could have one of her aides deal with it
, I'm sorry, but after your "yes" to DeVos, you are no longer trustworthy. Unbelievable.
WAIT, Meet with someone who was nominated for the Supreme Court? That's a new thing for you all isn't it?
