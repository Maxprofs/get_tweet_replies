Charlie's birth defect is cruel. Specialists say subjecting him to useless treatments would be cruel. Has nothing to do with #SinglePayer.
Socialism kills! Historically it just does! Leopards never change their spots! #singlepayer will kill!
Socialism isn't the same as Democratic Socialism. Learn before you speak. 

You have a good night, now.
Socialism is socialism clear and simple. Limited individual freedom. Socialism considers the group, capitalism the individual
Revising the promise to include replace is repeating a lie to make it true. It didn't go unnoticed. #FullRepealNow Senator #UnitedForFreedom
Senator, we are begging you to have a heart and not condemn the rest of the nation  to save alaskans. Thousands will die.
Cool! Then you told him you'd vote NO on #Trumpcare n Cruz Bill right? Cuz it guts Medicaid n Blue Cross says it's unworkable n no @PPact $?
Cuts have to be made! You can't just keep running up a trillion dollars in red ink every year!

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ … 
Preach, Lisa. Most of what the GOP has proposed basically says the 1% are far more important than the rest of us.
You're a republican. How do you think you get tax cuts?
