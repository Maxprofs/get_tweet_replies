The American Citizens of Puerto Rico spoke, NO MORE COLONY, YES STATEHOOD, CONGRESS NO MORE EXCUSES.
When Alaska was a territory they said that it was a piece of ice that would not contribute at all as a state.
The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico has already contributed with US military bases and thousands of troops.
I'm thinking of those who can not afford those deductibles. And those who should never been allowed to get onto Medicaid.
Play on - that is how seriously you take your charge -JOKE

Catholic bishops condemn Senate’s ‘simply unacceptable’ Trumpcare & RepealAndRun bill https://thinkprogress.org/faith-groups-health-care-109aa634022 … @GOP @senrobportman @JeffFlake
I am thinking of my wife today. She is one of the millions of people whose health and willbeing depends on your vote against the repeal
Im glad you can pay for it. We can't! thanks
And I encourage people to get out and vote for someone who will honor their word to repeal shity Obamacare
Ted must be rolling in his grave, after you ignore your constituents and break promises
We the People, will vote out all Republican Rino Traitor.
Committed to working across the aisle to fix the ACA. Yeah! As soon as the party is over and you're done dancing. Oops, time for Aug break.
Your going to have plenty of time to dance once you are voted out of office.

President @realDonaldTrump & every @SenateGOP member need to read this 10-yr-old boy’s letter before they repeal his mom’s healthcare today. 
Please vote NO on repeal or repeal/replace or moving the bill at all (whichever bill it ends up being, we don't know!)
A reminder - MILLIONS of Americans are counting on YOU to make our lives better, not worse. VOTE NO on this awful bill.
Bullshit!! You did nothing to help him when he needed you, because you knew that if he was able to run, you would lose. You have no talent!!
Get to repealing Obamacare and stop playing around.
Majorities across parties say GOP/President Trump are responsible for any #ACA problems going forward
kaiser

You'd ask for people to celebrate ONE man YOU hold dear while you would vote for that horrid GOP bill that would kill people others love?
Vote no on Trumpcare save millions of lives.
Text "Resist" to 50409 to fax letters to your Senators!
I wonder what Sen. Ted Stevens would think about collusion with Russia to win an election?
I know GrifterPotus thinks this is a Joke and just a "WIN" for his bizarre "agenda".. but no DDTrump this is PEOPLES LIVES, Vote NO
Do Not Vote on AHCA. this will destroy many alaskans lifes and grandparents. Why do you do this? KochGOP tried to primaryU Rmbr?
Ted Stevens was a legend and did so very much for the state in his time. We can remember him well !!

We will, unlike you, he actually did things for Alaskans. You just pander to the special interests. In 2018... YOUR FIRED
Your a dem in camo!
Are u going to accept bribe for your Trumpcare vote vote is more important then just your state. All of our lives depend on your vote.
Hope you didn't surrender your humanity & cave to big Don's nasty plans. Sounds like Shelly did. Hmmm I guess it's all about reelection.
What will you do when Trump has Mueller fired? If you love our country, you will vote for impeachment.
More SABOTAGE of ACA.  POTUS refuses to fund CSR's, now this.  Playing with people's lives here.
To GOP Senators: Taxpayers should repeal your salary/benefits/perks for 2 yrs. We will then let u know what u will get. Deal?  Fix ACA!
@lisamurkowski Please don't hurt us! Don't use stubborn logic.
@GOP reasoning to "Repeal & Replace"- We ran on it. 
According to Fox Poll, 74% of USA wants bipartisan #ACA fix.
@SenateGOP LISTEN TO US!
American Citizens of Puerto Rico demand right the presidential vote. Admission Act, now.
We don't
American Citizens of Puerto Rico demand right to choose their 7 congress members. Admission Act, now.
I've read that you are caving in to healthcare pressures from WH.  Hoping that this is not true. Very worried.
Oh look... The BRIBE you have accepted is likely ILLEGAL
If I'm Murkowski, last night's Parliamentarian ruling on the Buffalo Bribe makes me very nervous. The Polar Payoff is likely toast.
The man behind the multi-million dollar bridge to his family's property, now I understand your politics completely, ALL for me or NOTHING!
Lk
You are ruining millions of innocent lives if you vote yes.
Yet you're folding. I don't know how you wake up every morning. You are an evil, inhumane creature if you vote yes.
Medicaid will be gutted regardless of the bribe you're accepting, premiums will double at minimum, and # of uninsured will increase by 200+%
There are no words to describe people like you other than a cruel, heartless monster
  ALERT: We're hearing from Republican sources that calls into Capito and Murkowski recently swung from anti-repeal to pro-repeal.
I guarantee you Ted polished off the keg behind you!

From one mother to another please stay strong & vote no on the healthcare bill. We need to be able to care for our children. God bless you
Imagine next year's headline: Women of the Senate "Bare Arms" and Make History! Female Bipartisan Committee Fixes Healthcare For GOOD!"
My grandfather Milton Fairfax worked for Senator Gruening, who left office as Senator Stevens came into office. I wonder if they met? :)

Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do. 
But you did in 2015. What's changed?
This one might get signed... #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
To be clear, Obamacare isn't failing. @realdonaldtrump is sabotaging it.

We find no evidence of the individual market collapsing. Rather, insurers on track to have best year since ACA began http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/ …

This is what Lisa Murkowski told me in March about AHCA:

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
A 13k deductible is a joke. These plans will kick poor people off   healthcare, and create higher premiums for sick people. It's a joke.
Nice that you remember Ted Stevens, but why you need to work on improving our healthcare system.
Yes I miss him dearly. A good friend of Alaska.
Would you please vote yes on repealing Obamacare. You voted to repeal in 2015 and now voting no.  Why?
You should get to work and vote on a health care bill.
Fund the CSR's/other comps, provide a public option, and fix what needs fixing.  Make things better for us, not worse.  VOTE NO!
With the Cruz amendment, it'll be so much worse. McConnell doesn't want to do healthcare, POTUS hasn't bothered to educate himself. VOTE!

Cancer survivor shares with staffers of GOP Rep. Lamar Smith a powerful story about how Obamacare helped extend the life of a friend.

Loved him!!!
