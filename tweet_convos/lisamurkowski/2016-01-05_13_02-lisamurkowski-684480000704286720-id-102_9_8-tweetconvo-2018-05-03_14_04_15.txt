@lisamurkowski He is a friend to me and the millions who don't want to die by gun violence.
@toodeemo Just to make sure you got all the tweets the friend @BrentPiaskoski was referring to is Obama in a retort to-> @lisamurkowski
@ferallike @BrentPiaskoski @lisamurkowski OK. Thanks
@lisamurkowski I prefer a man who is a friend to his constituents rather than one who is a friend to the NRA, like yourself.
@lisamurkowski Nonsense. You punted when you could have done something.Shame on GOP for bowing to NRA, not respecting us.
@lisamurkowski @GOP if ya'll could stop trying to repeal Obama care every 2 weeks maybe you could work on real legislation. #doyourjob
@lisamurkowski you and the rest haven't done anything.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@lisamurkowski the GOP is in the NRA's pockets. I hope you see dead children every in your dreams every night. 

Go to hell!
@lisamurkowski thinks unlicensed gun peddlers shouldn't have to do background checks- no concern for local reputable gun brokers, I guess.
@lisamurkowski Bipartisan my bum. When has there ever been any bipartisan with President Obama. GOD. listen to yourself.
.@lisamurkowski How can you meet with Sandy Hook parents then turn around and vote to protect gun lobby profits. 20 angels were gunned down.
.@lisamurkowski Shame on you. @POTUS & most Americans want to prevent future gun deaths. It should be your job to protect us too! #NRApuppet
.@lisamurkowski Hey, @POTUS actually TAUGHT Constitutional Law. #backgroundchecks are within the LAW. Unlike U he's not in pocket of #NRA
@zizii2 @lisamurkowski @POTUS We need regular testing, licenses, and insurance to get driver's licenses should be same for gun ownership.
@quikjl @DemRaider @lisamurkowski. What "bipartisan solutions" you twit? He didn't damage 2A either. Did you have formal schooling?
@lisamurkowski Check out @Kris_Sacrebleu's Tweet:
Dear Conservatives, 

If you ridicule our President for crying over murdered school children, please check your soul 
@lisamurkowski NONSENSE. How much did NRA give you Lisa?
.@lisamurkowski Please offer practical bipartisan solutions. Thank you!
Did you seriously do a third-grade "HE DID IT FIRST" argument? Grow the hell up, you're a US Senator for God's sake! @lisamurkowski
@lisamurkowski The American people disagree with you...overwhelmingly.
@lisamurkowski He's a friend to those of us who want to live.  Your against Obamacare.  You don't care how or why people die.
@lisamurkowski And you don't even UNDERSTAND the Second Amendment. You are an embarrassment
@lisamurkowski   Old joke punchline: "Oh, I already know what you DO. All we're arguing about now is what you charge."
@lisamurkowski reading all the responses to your crap, I can see that you're just a puppet to the NRA and the people know it.
@lisamurkowski What chutzpah blaming POTUS for no bipartisan solutions to #gunviolence! Your side of aisle (funded by NRA) won't work w/ him
@lisamurkowski so what's your solution? More 'good guys' buying guns that turn out to be 'not the good guys'? Safety does not matter to you!
@lisamurkowski You are full of sh*t and do not know what you are talking about. What an embarrassment for Alaska that you were ever elected.
@lisamurkowski Takes one to know one.
See You Next Tuesday.
@lisamurkowski And you suck the left nut of the NRA that doesn't give a fuck about the American people.
@lisamurkowski Translation?  I'm owned by the NRA
@lisamurkowski and, btw, how much are you getting from the NRA?
@lisamurkowski blood is on your hands
@lisamurkowski seriously? That's the best line you could copy/paste?
@lisamurkowski gray wolves are awesome, but no reason guns can not be regulated like drivers licenses, car registration, etc.
@lisamurkowski wrong
OhHai!
@lisamurkowski You don't have a solution other than taking cash from the gun lobby. What's the polite word for that... Whoring?
@lisamurkowski Grow up or get out. We need adults to deal with this enormous problem. Not whiny, nonsense-spewing toddlers.
@lisamurkowski you're better than this.
@lisamurkowski you are not fit to hold office.
@lisamurkowski oh, get a grip.
@lisamurkowski He's not owned by the NRA and Big Oil either.
@lisamurkowski please... the GOP idea of "bipartisan" is whatever their lobbyist daddies demand in exchange for their money
@lisamurkowski Potus didn't mention latest Co. school shooting ended after 80 seconds due to another person there w/ a gun.
@lisamurkowski Oh by the way it currently takes a year to get thru govt ffl red tape. How long will it take when every sale needs one?
@lisamurkowski yet he has proven you wrong for 7 years.
@lisamurkowski Requiring people who sell more than 2 guns at a time is just a way to control private sales. When I die will my estate nd ffl
@lisamurkowski Gun show sales and internet sales go thru FFL dealers which means a background check unless between individuals.
@lisamurkowski I bet they also don't know that guns save an avg. of 1.5 million lives a year. As a home invasion victim mine saved me.
@lisamurkowski I guess that most of your respondents don't know what potus did is illegal let alone unconstitutional.
@lisamurkowski
B4 we go there, dear, let's talk abt Your BRIBE $$ from NRA & gun lobbyists.

@lisamurkowski @YouTube Aaand... *Crickets*!
@lisamurkowski Pbbbbbbbbbttttttttt.  How big was the check you got from the NRA Madame Senator?
@lisamurkowski You and your cronies sat back and did nothing.  As usual.
@lisamurkowski  No Senator. At least he's doing something about it. Your do nothing Congress is a disgrace to the memory of all victims.
- @lisamurkowski and you're no friend of Anerican school children or parents.
@lisamurkowski You can tell Murkowski is terrified of losing another primary to Joe Miller. And she should be.
.@lisamurkowski And you are no friend to bipartisanship.You've had 7 years! 7years!You've done nothing. The right to LIVE is a right.too!
@lisamurkowski Well, if by practical you mean ensuring assault weapons remain readily available to terrorists, then PBO is no friend.
@lisamurkowski If closing loopholes is what does it, 85 percent of the country aren't friends to the Second Amendment.
@lisamurkowski What *is* your practical bipartisan solution, besides offering more "thoughts and prayers" and taking more NRA blood money?
@lisamurkowski What can we do, when the Republicans support putting guns into the hands of the mentally ill.
@lisamurkowski Please explain, with a straight face 1 "practical bipartisan solutions to the gun violence problem" you think can pass cong.
@lisamurkowski With Republicans as delusional at they are, and Repub politicians in the pocket of the NRA, he had no choice.
.@lisamurkowski  You have no soul.
@lisamurkowski  We know YOUR record and where ur $ come from. #NRAPUPPET. Wrong side of history, again.
@lisamurkowski @ginsengity give me one example why he should trust the #GOP. They've done nothing to support him. Look at yourself.
@lisamurkowski Because the GOP has been nothing but collaborative with BO? You are a joke.
@lisamurkowski no friend of felons who rely on gun show loophole for accessb to weapons-like U R
@lisamurkowski #Ignore!
@lisamurkowski On Jan 21st 2009, u were told by Newt Gingrich to say NO to anything legislation proposed by PBO even if it killed Americans
@lisamurkowski U went to law school and u don't understand 2nd amendment. We have well-regulated militia. It's called law enforcement
@lisamurkowski How much does the NRA contribute to your coffers.
@lisamurkowski  Why don't U go ask the 12 that met during Obama's inauguration & vowed to obstruct then talk about bipartisanship.Ridiculous
@lisamurkowski Then why can't the GOP congress pass a bi-partisan bill and see if Obama would veto it?
@lisamurkowski JUST STOP YOUR LIES RIGHT NOW... Everyone knows the Republicans perverted the meaning of the 2nd Amendment for PROFIT!!
@lisamurkowski You turned down bipartisan legislation supported by 90% of Americans. How partisan can u get?
@lisamurkowski That tweet could not be more untrue and laughable.
@lisamurkowski   how much is the #NRA paying YOU  to sleep with them?
@lisamurkowski Senate had 54 votes for modest background check bill. Collins, Kirk, McCain, Toomey for it. Murkowski against. Needed 60.
@bobsp68 @lisamurkowski U tell her @bobsp68.  No low-info voters here. Sell that BS to ppl who don't know ur record.
@lisamurkowski keep licking the asses of the NRA!
@lisamurkowski may not be finding any friends here.  Might want to reconsider that NRA money you take
@lisamurkowski 
Yes. Please continue to do nothing as your @NRA masters command. Shame on you.
.@lisamurkowski Well, Senator, what's YOUR practical bipartisan solution to the gun violence problem? Go shoot something & then let us know.
@lisamurkowski Your GOP senate is no friend to the American people. You're on the wrong side of the aisle  & the wrong side of history.
@lisamurkowski Irony is a partisan attack by a partisan that claims lack of bi-partisanship. You did that well
@lisamurkowski incorrect you voted for background checks bill ..get burned by the NRA???
@lisamurkowski Sucks that he's only a friend to hundreds of thousands of dead people due to gun violence..
@lisamurkowski hi @NRA paid politician. . You are a horrible horrible person for catering to them and not to American ppl
@lisamurkowski And you're no friend of my RIGHT TO PRIVACY
  What's your point?
@lisamurkowski And you're a friend to the victims of gun violence?
@Chris_divine @lisamurkowski No. She is Friend of the people buying guns in back alleys used to make gun victims. Her gun co's need their $
@lisamurkowski Where is your “practical bipartisan solution”? Oh yeah, it doesn’t exist.
@lisamurkowski is this a serious statement? You wonder why Trump is the front runner..
@lisamurkowski And here's another good laugh - Republicans have bent over backwards trying to work with our majority elected President..
@lisamurkowski Work to stop senseless gun violence.  At least, beef up background checks. Guns are for hunting food only!
