Would have meant more if he'd voted no on the motion to proceed.
Great moving speech
McCain sure talks a good game, all right.
Most con artists are good at hiding their true colors.
But when push came to shove he held his ground and did the right thing....I'm proud of him for it.
I take back what I said about him. What he did was actually brilliant. /1
TrumpCare's deader than it would have been if he'd voted no on the MTP. He schooled McConnell for his underhanded tactics. /2
He literally reduced McConnell to TEARS and, with Murkowski and Collins, has destroyed McConnell politically. /3
You let us down today
Nah, she came through.
That is right, She is a democrat. Time to vote this turncoat out of office.
Nah. She's conservative that is using her knowledge and subject matter expertise to ask tough questions instead of getting swept away.
I'm curious that she voted repeal when Obama was POTUS but now that it would get signed she voted no. Two faced? Liar? FAKE for sure.
Or her state's circumstances changed. AK expanded Medicaid in 2015 after the repeal vote. Repeal now would hurt AK much more than in 2015.
Riiiiiiiight! I'm all for private insurance when it has zero chance but now it's sure to get signed, things are suddenly different. Riiiight
Thank you for sharing that.
I guess enemies of the United States like Murkowski and McCain find confort in each other while trying to cripple the country..Traitor.
Thank you for posting this.
WHY did you vote ahead of @SenJohnMcCain on the #healthcarebill He stepped out/you voted out of alphabetical order - Diabolical plan
At this point, arguing for "crossing the aisle" = capitulation to Dems to lead rather than the GOP who were elected.  Backing a dead horse.
He will get the best care for his Brain Cancer. He doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. He didn't starve as a POW. No Hero.
Spineless liars both of you.
2010: Murkowski urges repeal of ACA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA09df_ekfA â€¦
McCain Stands for Seniors and Vets and Disabled,,, STAND STRONG SENATOR  Im Glad you have INSURANCE from Tax Payers. Be Well Soon
Bull!

@POTUS Not at all. John McCain is a traitor to this nation which is outrageous. There must be TERM LIMITS; U are ONLY interested in power!
TRAITOR RINO!
#regularorder
Yes. You and McCain led the way in dropping the ball for the greatest constitutional victory of this generation: Repeal. Shame on you BOTH.
why are the Republicans the only one who wants bipardison.  I think it's because we have trojin donkeys in our mist.
I guess the bigots flock together
This lady is an idiot if she thinks John McCain was serious...he gave reelection speeches like that all the time.
This lady is an idiot if she thinks John McCain was serious...he gave reelection speeches like that all the time.
He is a traitor!
Sorry Mccain is ill but you all are double minded. Promises made in 2015 elect us we'll repeal Obama care. DOUBLE SPEAK. CAN'T BE TRUSTED!
Thank you for your vote tonight.  You did the right thing for the country.
Supporting Socialism?

For someone who claims to be independent, all your positions and ideologies align with the left.

And @SenJohnMcCain HEROES!!!   ! 3 republicans stood up!
@linkipod McCain is a traitor and so are you you have no idea what you have done to the poor American people. God help you 
The man has a brain tumor for God's sake.  Able to think, he is not!
The only words I ever want to hear from that man ever again are his last wishes. Oath breaker, coward and a traitor
As usual he has to show boat for attention. He also has brain cancer. He should not be making decisions affecting us
