President @realDonaldTrump & every @SenateGOP member need to read this 10-yr-old boy’s letter before they repeal his mom’s healthcare today.

Please vote No on GOP healthcare bill. I have two children w pre-existing conditions. Please – your vote matters to entire country …

Wow. Catholic nuns: this is the "most harmful legislation for American families in our lifetimes"; it is "simply immoral" and not pro-life. 
@lisamurkowski Begging, pleading. Please vote no. We are exhausted.
This. Because the @WhiteHouse for political agenda, would rather hurt the poor, disabled, children, and elderly- than fix #ACA for all.

Stop hiding. Republican obcession with repealing ACA is the issue. Fix ACA in bipartisan fashion, don't wreck it!
A signed repeal followed with and contradicted by a broken promise equals very negative attention. #FullRepeal of the ACA  #UnitedForFreedom

6/ Parliamentarian says you can't buy off Senators with state-specific funding. Are those sections (like for AK and LA) still in? Out?
Do your job - represent your constituents.  NO on motion to proceed on BCRA.  No one, No group supports it.  People before GOP party!!!

From @AARPAlaska: Senate repeal proposals will make health care unaffordable for Alaskans ages 50-64. @lisamurkowski #StayStrong #VoteNO https://twitter.com/aarpalaska/status/888931751938142209 …

Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do. 
@lisamurkowski What if HMOA1973 was partially reversed so Insurance Co's were not for profit again?
Surprise!! 
It was Richard Nixon who ended Not for Profit Health Insurance with the HMOA1973. (Health Maintenance  Organization Act) 

This father is walking from North Carolina to DC to protest Trumpcare––representing his daughter and so many like her who rely on Medicaid: 
You are a BOLD FACE LIAR 
Patriots won't forget. Better start planning your future! You're out in 2018!

Rt & thank @lisamurkowski. Please continue to #SpeakUpForUs & #ProtectOurCare. #RepealAndRun is not an option. 
Remember when you voted to repeal Obamacare?....Maybe have 1/100th of a backbone and just do what you did before.

#ACA repeal will have devastating impacts on innocent Americans. @SenateGOP Here are just a few of millions. #ProtectOurCare #SaveMedicaid 
Please vote no on BCRA and any repeal-only bill brought to the Senate floor. Country over party! #LetUsLive
Please vote no on health bill for all our sakes. country before party!! Your nation needs you!  Rooting for your strength in these times
You need to be a team player and not a maverick/obstructionist. If not you will own Obamacare!!! Unconscionable and unacceptable!
Please oppose the #Trumpcare bill that McConnell is trying to shove down our throats, tens of millions off ins for a tax cut is horrifying.
unless tens of Millions more will be covered and premiums will go down. Pls, pls don't let heath care bill be jammed thru.
Hey cruel monster. You're on tape. Are you going to prove that to be a lie?
Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do. 
This cancer survivor is begging you to #ProtectOurCare, Senator. #KillTheBill
Are u voting on a bill that almost no one knows what is in it? No hearings no input from professionals?No public input? Is that America?
When will you actually stand up for our country? When ? R's and D's will remember what you did Not do to protect our country and democracy!
Vote your conscience not your party-people are depending on you to get this right-not one public hearing is not the way to do business
Please don't let the bribe money sell out your own people. They are using you to get a vote. McConnell/Pence doesn't care about Alaska.
Your party's president, along wth Pruitt, disbelieve climate science. I'm sure Cdr Evans knows the actual science.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage."
