Hate these gmo fish. Love fishing AK. Hope you stop Pebble Creek mine from destroying AK salmon fishing economy. 
Vote no tRumpcare.
If you love fishing, you need to support genetically engineered fish that make fish farming less expensive, more productive
I support wild fish populations and healthy environments. Proper regulations ensures plentiful, healthy populations.
No bizzaro fish 4 me
Charlotte, I'm doing research right now on the global tuna fishing industry.  In spite of many regulations, S.Atlantic bluefin now extinct.
Appreciate your research and credentials, while respectfully and strongly differing about GMO.
OK. Would you mind telling me how you came to your conclusion?
We seem to get a particle of information and run with it while ignoring the bigger picture. Tonsillectomies come to mind.
Charlotte thanks for your views. But I'm totally confused by this statement. I totally have no idea what you are saying. Please explain.
These fish seem like they might be dangerous to our health. Like this bill that you should vote no on.
Elias, over 280 independent scientific organizations, over 500,000 independent scientists world-wide say genetically engineered food is safe
Yeah I bet - although GMO fish hybrids sound weird, I was just saying she should vote NO on the BCRA. Cross whatever fish ya want to.
Lets just hope she keeps voting NO on whatever S--- they come up with!   BTW, they're not fish hybrids or crosses.that's not how G.E. works!
Yeah - just Twitter shorthand. I have a degree in biochemistry
Good to hear you have a STEM training. Are you using your degree now?
Btw, the three of us are planning our company retreat in the Sawtooths and Frank Church WoNR.
Cool.  Is that not a long trip for you?   If I may ask, what does your company do?   I always stand in awe of people who start businesses.
Thx 4 ur commitment 2 food Justice, will u also cosponsor  hemp farming act? It's important 4 fisheries that plant Omega3s be destigmatized
It's not "food justice" when you deplete a species when there is technology that can reduce overfishing & environmental impact of food.
Im no expert but isnt Fish farming gross in gen? this adds a ginea pig component. I hope its not worse but labeling is a food justice thing
1/3  Fish farming is not "gross"...the fish are fed well, not exposed to predators, & don't eat God-knows-what.  We are rapidly pushing
2/3 commercially important species of fish to extinction; there are not enough fish in wild to meet demand.  Fish farming does not
3/3 hurt environment like so much other farming.  These "gmo" fish are still salmon, they just grow faster, more efficiently. Win-win-win.

WTH is this. The cruz amendment eliminates pre-existing conditions. I posted this all over the Alaskan republican facebooks they pissed.
How about you fight #FrankenCare. VOTE NO #BCRA
The American people won't accept "fake healthcare " either
in fact the data show AquAdvantage salmon would reduce pressures on/ threats to wild Alaska salmon. See here  https://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/developmentapprovalprocess/geneticengineering/geneticallyengineeredanimals/ucm280853.htm …
I protect wild salmon by not eating them in the first place.   Farmed sustainably  for me!
Why not just admit that you are representing your constituent's concerns about their jobs harvesting wild #salmon. #fearmongering
Senator, I've worked hard to understand this fish and issue, your rhetoric is scientifically imprecise. Glad to help you understand.
#BRCA shouldn't be allowed to be "sold" either. Will you sell your nation for the price of your state? #BRIBE
PLEASE oppose this bill. The perks to help Alaska's Medicare beneficiaries is not enough. Planned Parenthood defunding will effect millions.
I'm all for clear labeling, but a "frankenfish" label is just fear-mongering. How about push for a label of origin, wild vs farmed.
Most Alaskan salmon in stores is "Wild Caught" not really wild salmon.
Just when I was starting to like you.
There are no restrictions on labeling wild caught #salmon. No need for government- forced label, unless the goal is to instill fear.
Public officials promoting ideology over technology that helps preserve species & reduce environmental impact need to be voted out of office
She does represent Alaska..
I don't care who she "represents".  She's promoting an anti-science ideology, instead of promoting fish farming to preserve wild fish
The science says your wrong. Please stop promoting political ideology over facts.
If it's nutritionally the same, and farm raised what's the problem? Your scientific understanding of genetics seems to be lacking.
Yeah. The difference is the "frankenfish" increases availability, and more sustainable by reducing inputs. Now go #KilltheBill #BCRA
The "huge difference" boils down to competition for Alaskan fishing industry. Oh, and GE salmon are far more sustainable than wild caught.
Your privilege is showing.  It must be nice when you don't know anyone who doesn't have enough to eat.
"Frankenfish?" What are you, 12? This is the level of discourse among our elected officials? Embarrassing.
*Imagined* 

Can you describe the "huge" difference? Would your clear labeling (not opaque or solid) list "fake fish", or "frankenfish"?
I call for a blind taste test! Not only is there nothing fake about #GMO Salmon, it isn't even a threat to Alaska's industry. (Hint: farmed)
Do you mean a blind taste test like the original GMO launch foist upon the masses under the doctrine of substantial equivalence?
Can you explain this "huge difference"? Most of the lit says GE salmon and conventional are about same w/r/t nutrition.
Agree there's big difference b/n aquaculture and wild (one's fishery, one's farm) but that's true with or without GE on market.
What's your opinion on GMO-produced #insulin? Do you consider it a frankendrug or a "fake drug?
Frankenstein used parts of deceased humans. DNA hadn't even been discovered when Mary Shelly penned her wonderful prose! Feel better now?2/2
So, senator, when did you last read " Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus"? I think you'll find it educational when it comes to this. 1/2
"Frankenfish" #slur plus misleading graphic don't add up to an argument, they only reveal superstition. #FreetheFish
Well said Dr Maxham - the senator is actually "feeding" fear. She needs to see @foodevomovie with eyes and ears open: STAT!
And we won't accept 'dead fish' in our Senate, especially with @SenateGOP! Deliver what you promised! Or, quit!
Please vote no on Trumpcare - don't accept junk/'fake' healthcare plans being spun. Alaska deserves better!
That's what we normals call "regulation".
And there's a huge difference between great health care for America and the horrible Senate bill. Stand up for what is right. #VoteNoBCRA
Agreed. Now please don't take a one-time payoff to allow this fake healthcare bill that will do real damage to Americans.
You won't accept "fake fish", but you accept fake healthcare? Priorities askew? Morals lost? Hypocrisy unchecked?
And please do not accept the very real bribe from McConnell to vote against Alaskans health care.  Please stand strong for your constituents
That's great! Now don't accept a fake healthcare package that will harm millions upon millions of Americans. Vote No!
Excellent stand. Agree with labels so people know fish choices. Please do not let Sen Maj Ldr buy your vote on healthcare. Protect people.
No good reason to throw people off healthcare to get tax cut for people who are getting plenty wealth under current tax structure. Thank you
well, you should approve of technology that lets farmer grow fish faster with less inputs, so we can all have more salmon w/o overfishing.

.@lisamurkowski Don't accept fake healthcare either. Join your colleagues. Make ur Dad proud
Say no to fake healthcare. Don't sell out to this corruption!
Without health care it doesn't matter if the fish is fake.
Murkowski cares about fake fish - she doesnt care about human beings who will be hurt by her healthcare vote

Such an evil human being
Nor should u except bribes for the other fake fish, known as trumpcare! Just dont
Dont let the Cruz bribe to Ak sway ur vote!It is illusory ins that harms all especially the poor, women, kids. Vote no on this flaming pile!
But u accept fake ins w/ trumpcare?It will harm 99% of Americans&all Alaskans.Ak gets$1b bribe:u should still say no
How about a 'FAKE' president?  

Please vote NO!
Will you accept the GOPs bribe on healthcare though? The nation is watching.
Then you probably shouldn't accept the GOP's fake health care plan, either.
@lisamurkowski 3.1 billion is more than 1 1/2 times as much as $1.8 billion. So Murkowski's state and her constituents still get screwed
@lisamurkowski Alaska to lose $3.1 billion by 2026. McConnell is offering up to $1.8 billion in new federal funding.
Without clear labeling ? It's fake! Why would you even allow it to be sold? I guess selling out is in your blood?
Speaking of healthy, vote NO to #trumpcare. The fish won't matter to those who die from lack of healthcare. Please do what's right.

BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 
And huge difference between a fake healthcare bill and one that really protects people. Please vote against @AHCA
Please!  We need to know what's in our food & how it's developed. Thank you.
Rose, fishing wild fish is not sustainable - soon there will be no fish. Pls support the technology that will let us always have fish to eat
Say NO to #trumpcare!
Thanks!
FAKE FISH IS GROSS.... CREATE MORE JOBS FOR ALL #EEO
I believe you've been bought and bribed for just like the GOP leadership has already admitted to doing
You're actually thinking of voting for this disaster? You're an evil monster. Your silence says a lot. Shame.
BREAKING: In rare joint letter, insurers say Cruz amendment "unworkable in any form" and will lead to "widespread terminations of coverage." 

If you want to have faith in America's politicians, watch @AkGovBillWalker & how he thinks about health care, his state & the AK buy-off. https://twitter.com/akgovbillwalker/status/886008527482830848 …

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
Senator, whole country is hoping you will come out as a 'no' on Trumpcare. We'd love to hear from you so that we can relax - until then:
GMOs have been shown in 1000s of studies to be safe. Labeling will stifle biotech industries just to appease people's need to fear science
Stop feeding a fear of science. This is how we end up with so many climate change deniers in the US.
Then please don't accept 'fake' heathcare. Do what is right. If insurers say it won't work, it won't.

Well Alaska's top Medicaid official still hates BCRA (tho her office pointed me to the state's Insurance Division on the Klondike Kickback) 
How could anyone now be undecided about voting no? So many more people will suffer if #BCRA passes. Fix The ACA. No repeal or replace.
Just vote for the health care bill
Vote yes as a Republican.  I'm sure you're getting no votes from Dems
I hope your vote is not for sale. America hoping you will vote for what's best for US

Senator you are right not to accept a fake. McConnell's Alaska carve out is the exact same  - https://www.cbpp.org/blog/alaska-carveout-in-revised-senate-health-bills-state-stability-fund-doesnt-address-unique-harms …. Stinky rotten fish.
Vote NO on BCRA.  Horrible for people w/ pre-existing conditions, & if u recover you are stil stuck paying higher. Everyone can get sick.
I won't either! Thank you for saying that!! Hope you don't cave into the R's trying to buy your vote!! The people of AK deserve better!
Out at the time and see if there is any give, weak spots and work on that until you have the whole building safe, secure, warm and solid.
You have to put in support beams, even if temp, before you rip out the bad rafters. Put a strong system in place first and take one board...
Please vote no on the repeal. Think of house restoration. Roof bound to fall in, old rafters rotten beams with a roof full of snow. Cntinued
I thought you were making an allegory
Please do not cave on healthcare. Please vote no.
Please vote NO on the BCRA! Please show the people that you listen to them & truly care about them! History will remember the BCRA as cruel.
Don't sell out all Americans. Say no!!!!!!
Are you now a yes vote for the health care bill?  Are your alleged concerns swept away now McConnell bought you off?
https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/7/13/15966034/senate-republicans-exemption …
Please vote NO on the BCRA.  Form a coalition to seek a bipartisan solution.  Don't you think bipartisanship leads to long lasting/
more successful legislation?  Thank you!
How about not accepting this terrible #HealthcareBill! Please #voteNO #trumpcare
Great move, Senator! More information is always better. I hope you extrapolate your sense on fish to #GMO @ewg @NonGMOProject @KamalaHarris
Interesting, but you should be posting your strong and committed opposition to the Senate healthcare law. Some things are that important.
Americans have made it clear.We don't want Senate #Trumpcare bill. Do  the right thing, for Alaska & rest of America. Please vote no.
Keeping the ACA intact will be worth more and it will serve the whole country.
Desperate Mitch McConnell resorts to Alaska bribe to try to save GOP health repeal vote

http://shareblue.com/desperate-mcconnell-resorts-to-alaska-bribe-to-save-gop-health-care-vote/ ……
Please don't sell out the country.
Look at what this bill does last column folks and she still has not said NO to Trumpcare
You know what else is good for you? Healthcare without yearly and lifetime limits.
YOU DON'T SAY
But willing to vote Yes on Trumpcare as the GOP bribes her! Call folks tell her to vote no or lose HC
Millionaire @lisamurkowski wants to STEAL healthcare from 67,000 Alaskans to give TAX CUTS to the RICH (including herself)!!!
Word
Senator, do right by the people and vote NO!!!!
No tax cuts for billionaires at expense of health care for poor and elderly @SenDeanHeller @SenatorCollins @SenRandPauI @MSNBC @CNN
Fake fish, fake health care
LOOK A THIS MAP YOU RECEIVED A POLAR PAYOFF FOR THIS.
Next up the demolishing of Bristol Bay for Pebble Creek or cutting Medicaid.. sad..
NO on #BCRA!  
Worst plan yet, but you want to exempt yourselves?  Completely abhorable!

Is fake fish like fake access to healthcare we really can't afford? VOTE NO ON THE BRCA
Those skimpy plans are a joke -and recommended by Cruz an even bigger joke!  Don't vote yes to give Sociopath McConnell a win! People first!
Wow, your priorities
it's not fake fish. Don't you have a duty to understand the facts before you try & pass laws. Stop fear mongering.
More frankenstuff: mules, pigs, dogs, cats, kale, heirloom tomatoes, canola, chicken, soy, spinach... Literally everything farmed is GMO
If you aren't willing to accept "Fake Fish" why are you willing to vote for the GOP "Fake Health Care" Bill which will deny millions ins?
Exactly, as a former Alaskan I am appalled!
1 of my nieces is there now doing research on a sustainable water reclamation project, you'd think Sen Murkowski would care about her health
You don’t fix the Affordable Care Act by giving America's 400 richest families a $7 million annual tax cut. Please vote no!
Ms. Murk, we're concerned only w/ healthcare right now and need u to do right by us in opposing new Senate bill.
Please also don't accept "fake insurance" that Cruz Amendment wd allow to be sold! Please vote NO on GOP #HealthcareBill. Instead, #SaveACA!
Please don't vote for repeal. You'll be betraying your state and your country. And Trump will turn on you in the end.
This is really like the new GOP Health Care plan,It retains all of the Medicaid cuts that were already in the bill—cuts that are deeper..NO!
Glad to know where you stand on Frankenfish. Where do you stand on the latest TrumpCare disaster of a bill?
Gutting Medicaid will materially hurt Alaskans. Are you voting for or against Trumpcare?
"#Trumpcare's designed to drastically weaken America's health security therefore a woeful alternative to Obamacare"
Please don't take Mitch's bribe! Vote No on McConnell's evil Healthcare  bill. (It should be called a Deathcare bill.)
Thanks for all the fish! Can you make sure the members of congress are covered by the same health care bill as the people?
Please vote NO on BCRA, senator!!
Why are the @SenateGOP not showing CBO score on the Cruz amendment to BCRA. Americans see what they are doing & it's immoral. PLS VOTE NO
You're a good woman Lisa, keep up the fight for good healthcare for Americans.
please vote no on new terrible healthcare repeal
Wow . This is so important. People above Medicaid threshold can't afford HC because of O care and this is what u tweet?
Sounds like people are going to need good health insurance.
