If you worked across the aisle your budget would reflect all Americans.
Funny, I don’t remember the last president working with republicans.
Are you taking meds for your dementia or is it the result of being dropped on your head?
100 hearings and 160 gop amendments to the ACA.
Obamacare was unconstitutionally forced down our throats, so of course their would be gop amendments
The hearings, amendments and SC approval prove the dems willingness to work across the aisle and legality of the ACA.

This was obamas...had to be




Yeah, that happens after overwhelming reelection and 8 years in office 
"The senate passed the 2018 budget. Now it's time to let rich whites get richer" - McConnell translation
Finally, actions speaks louder than words.
What's in it?
Sad
Welp was nice having school, roads, meals on wheels, social security and Medicare while it lasted hopefully country gets better b4 I’m old
More spending no cuts with $20 trillion in debt.  Great job McConnell.

Well, I'll be damned....finally, you guys accomplished something. I think I'm having a stroke...
Your tax reform scheme is BS. The wealthy get giant benefits, the rest get crumbs. Shame on you!

FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOU
I'll give you an Amen on that. Make it happen and then repeal #ObamaCare!
Reform to ensure that corporations continue to control and enslave the people
CALL IT " WE STILL STEAL FROM MIDDLE CLASS WHILE MAKING RICH PAY ZERO" TAX.

To pay for corporate tax cuts, Republicans are considering taxing your retirement savings. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/20/us/politics/republicans-tax-401-k.html?smid=fb-share&_r=0 …
Why is @SenMajLdr McConnell always so happy when he can stick it to the USA and its citizens? #TaxReform : another big lie.
trump responsible 4 deaths in Niger. Why it took him 2 weeks and media pressure to speak about it.
Sums it up pretty damn well, @realDonaldTrump 
Yeah
we  know who this tax plan benefits and it is not we-the-people

Good luck!
.@SRuhle would you please respond to this? I'm a #Wyoming constituent, so my voice falls on deaf ears. Maybe he'll talk to you? Thanks!
Yes! Good work ! Bring on the Tax Reform !
@McConnellPress @BudgetGOP #CAF  = #CorrupAF = You.
Right, Mitch!  The pusillanimous congress fucked the American people once again. Now a stupid wall for a stupid man, and more for the rich.
No cuts to AMT. No cuts to estate tax. Working families are tired of the rich getting richer while we continue to struggle!
HOW MANY BREAKS DID YOU GIVE TO YOUR RICH BUDDIES?
@ZiffyKat @SenatorEnzi @BudgetGOP  Wow-- Congress did something.
Now #RepealandReplace
If you don’t pass tax reform McConnell ur going to be out the door

$4 trillion. I guess that's fiscal discipline now
Heterosexual [straight], LGBTIA, or any taxpayers who aren’t married—regardless of their parent or guardian status—shouldn’t have to pay higher taxes simply because they’re single due to the 14th Amendment, Section 1's [equal (protections/obligations) clause] protections.
Shameful that you put your rich donors over middle class.  No tax cuts for rich if any middle class families have to pay more.
1 victory. Be still my beating heart.
WTH? 
Holding hostage??
It is a tremendous tremendous budget. My pen is ready Paul..ball in your court now! @SpeakerRyan   MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!
The Koch Bros own your sorry ass. Do you even understand what constituent means anymore? You sold your soul to the devils.
Only sociopaths celebrate a budget that gives tax cuts to the wealthy by gutting Medicare/Medicaid. That's the GOP for you. Heartless.
GOP just voted to cut $1.5 trillion from medicare/medicaid. Vote GOP out in 2018!
Get it done!

Thank God we got something done somehow! Now TAX CUTS! dON'T MESS IT ALL UP WITH "reform"! Call it TAX CUTS! Get it done now! MAGA!
Blame the GOP (Gob of Poop).



1.5 trillion added to the deficit... I though your party were fiscally conservative?
Great you all can do a lot without the obstructionist democrats
What a load! Jobs were sent overseas for ONE REASON and a NOT coming Back!  Business' pay $1 a day for labor they will NOT pay that HERE!
Your budget cuts $1.5T fr Medicare&Medicaid to give tax cuts to your rich donors-you've traded lives for $
Will not vote Republican in the next elections.  You're making a Dem out of an Independent.
One Step Closer to helping the Trump Dynasty with bigger tax breaks.
GOP just committed political suicide by passing a budget that cuts vital services to pay for tax cuts to the rich We are watching we vote
@realDonaldTrump NO INSRUANCE BAILOUTS They spend 100's of MILLIONS $$$$ on LOBBYISTS
@TheJusticeDept WTP HAVE  WIDE OPEN 2 CORRUPTION n USA BOUGHT & PAID-4 CONGRESS MOX:  BILLIONS of taxpayer $$$ KICKBACKS-LOBBISTS?
Republicans have become trolls for Trump! Reward the rich & put the screws to the middle class -the Republican Way!
Wow. Dear Leader finally got his majority together and did something. Took 10 months.

so what up with rand paul????
Relief for the rich
Nice job, only serving the minority of Americans as usual.
#TAX CUT Complexity Uprightly Trimmed


Doesn’t mean shit. Please stop. Trump and you following him lead you to Hell are liars and losers. Go away with your bs to screw Americans.
adding trillions to the debt, circumventing reconciliation with the house, drilling in the Arctic...
@doedeer1664 I'm sure we're getting screwed
Finally, Thank you! Now get Tax Reform/Cuts done this year! Make them retroactive!
Awesome!
The Republican Senate boldly shows stupidity.
Thanks for nothing.
You cut Medicare/Medicaid to give the rich more tax cuts. This will end badly for you. You’ll lose your majority. And you will deserve it.
Good for you
“Should we bend over now? “- the middle class
This is indeed a good step, Mr. Majority Leader. We in the Trump base applaud you because you acted this time.
Bend over poor people the 1% is coming for your small portion too
Cut $1T from Medicaid
Cut $473B from Medicare
Add $1.5T to the deficit
Next, Give tax cuts to the rich
How about #regular order how about #bipartisanship ?
Tax reform. You mean the GOP plan that benefits the rich and corporations only. Tell u what Mitch roll that plan up real tight and shove it
Time for #honesty! Time for help for the #middle and #lower classes!
We're sure it's crap-tasic example how we should all be like Kentucky burdened, stupid, dirt poor & only worried about eating & breeding.
@McConnellPress @SenatorEnzi @BudgetGOP
Hitler would be proud
Senator Enzi gave the Greatest Speach in Senate History "Get your Butts in your seats and quit stumbling around or we'll be here all night "
It’s about time now get tax reform and heathcare

Thank you for the hard work Senator. Good luck with that bunch in the Senate on Tax Reform. Hang in there sir.
Wait?  This is cutting Medicare?  Explain please!
I hope public don't find hidden cuts to essential programs in this budget. I have zero confidence that you and GOP  will do right thing.
Yhy do you love the rich so much and hate every one else. How do you sleep at night?

Thanks Senator McConnell for your help on getting this passed. I know it was difficult with all those democrat idiots that you work with.
You suck !
The #Senate has passed the 2018 #Budget.  Thanks Koch Brothers and Mr. Adelson for all of your campaign $$. Now it's time for your tax cuts!
#ImpeachTrumpNow
#TaxReform must include #NMTC & #HTC. Proven ways to leverage limited Fed $$ for maximum job creation & critical infrastructure preservation
Do we get a refund for the years you did nothing?
Ruination awaits.
This is not a good thing
God help you!
Yeah! Every win is a stepping stone to bigger & better things. #Trump #GOP #Conservative = fiscal responsibility.
#trump=wtf is wrong with this guy.
Dude isn't wrapped very tight.
And am I replying to a bot?
Ugh.. (that's not an acronym) that's just disgust that U guys r so #unpatriotic & #unAmerican 2 foist this sham that guts services on US ppl
Are you happy about your tax cut?  I am not happy my taxes will go up!  Shame on you for being selfish
Don't know how you do it lies misinformation stealing from poor people. That's conservative? I think not.  GOP is greed party.
Did you finally defund planned parenthood?

Oct. 1 deadline has long since passed for trump to enact Russian sanctions. Why has this not been addressed yet? Asking for an angry nation.
You get the 2018 boot award
About time!
You are an evil, self-servicing narcissistic white supremacist.  Putting Party ahead of country is what you do. God have Mercy on your soul.
Did you approve massive travel for the president to golf and frequent family vacations? With record setting security costs?
@SenateGOP @SenatorEnzi @BudgetGOP finally the GOP did something. Shame on you for not helping President Trump all the time
Plz explain!RNC&The WhiteHouse endorsed repealing FATCA 2 replace w/Territorial Tax.So why isn't this inTax Reform?Why is this so hard 2 do?
