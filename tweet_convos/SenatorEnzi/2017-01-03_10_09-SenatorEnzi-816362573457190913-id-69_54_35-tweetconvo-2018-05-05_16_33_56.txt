@SenatorEnzi and what do  you offer in place? NOTHING http://ln.is/www.aol.com/article/WVkR9 â€¦ GOP use resolution to repeal w/o any Dems.
@SenatorEnzi How about you & your cronies give up your insurance in a show of solidarity with those of us you're taking it from?
We don't count in your world, u don't care about the middle class, there are over 20 million of us.
@SenatorEnzi If I could, I would introduce a bill to repeal your health care. We the people fought hard to enact ACA. For shame.
Why should my family be burdened with someone else's healthcare & welfare. They drive better cars than we do and we both work 
Um, I pay full price for my premium, because I can't get insurance through my job. So am I burden to you?
People who have a bunch of kids & are on state funded healthcare & welfare does
We are cancelling all health insurance benefit to senate and congress. Roll back salaries to time worked. No pension
, how foolish, reckless, & cruel to plunge families into uncertainty. The hard work of creating coverage comes FIRST
@SpeakerRyan You will feel the impact from your actions. Taking away health benefits from millions of people?
A reminder to ANYONE who wanders into this feed OBAMACARE WAS THEIR IDEA IN THE FIRST PLACE: http://shorty.3rdlof.com/40bqx 
This is the end of the Republican Party. People will die without health insurance coverage.
please work on a replacement.  Hate to have 20 million to lose coverage or go back to pre existing conditions.
I have lupus, without Ocare I wouldn't have access to healthcare because preexisting cond. LITERALLY saves my life
@SenatorEnzi your plan better not includ me your son brad enzi and two elk
how is your son and mike Ruffatto on the 5.3 million dolllars carbon capturing
Are you seriously crazy enough to remove Health Care from over 20,000 people that need Medical help, only because of it's NAME
Good luck finding a way to replace the ACA with something that will still cover the 20 million people Obama added
NO REPEAL No going back. This Nurse sees it up close& it works. ACA is here to stay. The old systems is broke.
@realDonaldTrump law is AffordableCare act(ACA) &the law is good &helps more than 25 million. Esp in WVa #ERnurse
Mike Enzi's top donor? DaVita HealthCare Partners ... follow the money.
@SenatorEnzi  unless you have comparable if not better plan for the citizens of Wyoming you need to vote against repeal of ACA
If people die because they lose their health insurance to #ObamaCareRepeal, that will amount to a #CrimeAgainstHumanity.
Don't #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@SenatorEnzi I presume this will be accompanied by a repeal of taxpayer funded Healthcare for our elected officials
When constituents finally get something of value for their taxes, like the ACA, the GOP comes to pick their pockets again! Bad!
@SenatorEnzi how about repealing the two elks project
@SenatorEnzi how is your son brad Enzi with mike Ruffatto doing? Sentencing for Mike rufatto on feb 3rd? How are those carbon
@SenatorEnzi  NO on Repeal! You are putting politics above peoples lives&healthcare without a plan. Scary and illogical.
You have NO mandate for repeal! #ACA lowers medical costs & saves lives. Stupid to repeal, esp. without replacement.
@SenatorEnzi no where does it say what will you replace it with? Or if you have anything better. All you want to do is replace it
My husband is self employeed, I work part time, we only have insurance because of the ACA.
U got something ready to replace? U want to take it away from millions, while those millions pay UR heathcare? 2018!
That means people will LOSE their coverage.  Don't take such JOY in hurting  constituents. @maddow
@MaddowBlog It seems the logical thing to do would be to debate what they will put in its stead before repealing it.
....so what are you replacing it with?????? are we getting universal coverage for all?
@FedSnap I am so glad these fools can't think of anything to do but fuck up a good thing, not make it better,  just scrap it.
Unpatriotic #GOP use thought of killing more Americans as substitute 4 viagra  #GOPHATESUSA #GOPMAKESUSASICKER
Husband is disabled but will have to continue to work w/o #ACA. Do you care?
Where's the replacement plan? I miss the old GOP, the new GOP is venal & unAmerican
you are either a sociopath or demon-possessed to ax the health insurance program used by 20 million Americans.
And not a single Dem saw this coming???
And what is the replacement? Insurance companies, hospitals & citizens all need certainty in health care. But you now that.
No repeal until replacement made public and vetted #Obamacare Youve had 6 yrs where's the plan!
Better do something to get that ethics debacle off the front page. #unethical
@MaddowBlog  Middle class was nice while it lasted.
The fear of losing healthcare contrasts nicely with the hell they'd bring on doing so. But more likely they'll just half-ass it.
@MaddowBlog. Nothing has changed!
@MaddowBlog Tell them NO!  We The People must Call, Text, Email. Make our voices heard!
time to start calling again. Just put the number on speed dial ppl.
@MaddowBlog Do explain to the American public GOP plan for replacement for the 20 million people, friends & family
Getting ready for a lot more phone calls, I see.
kind of cruel that those who can afford health care without insurance would take it aways from those who can't
@MaddowBlog #noplan #goplost #noplan #NoRepealWithoutReplace
@MaddowBlog don't repeal, fix the flaws instead. Taking away insurance wrong way to go! #The Resistance
Are you going to repeal the Senate's Healthcare until you come up with a replacement? Didn't think so. Selfish Hypocrites!
@MaddowBlog ok Trumpsters here you go. Hope you all are very healthy
@MaddowBlog "Repeal And , Eh, We'll Think Of Something Later"? Good to see #GOP #Stupidity is still at full force.
Dare ya, GOP. I dare ya. Take away my insurance, you do that.
@MaddowBlog twats. That is my word of the day.
You're debating on my family's healthcare and you have no backup plan.
Because nothing says "Family Values" like denying millions of Americans Healthcare!
@karoli Starting now?
