protecting the american public or your pocket book?  Shameful
I do not support Betsy DeVos, please don't either! From Laramie, WY
@WhiteHouse Yeah, good job! Now $17 billion/year can be stolen from retirees. But why would you care? YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN!
you know, it would be beneficial to list pros and cons of the "fiduciary rule" on ur site so people could be informed.
They aren't going to spell out how they plan to rip off the American public. Shameful. #fire_the_fool
@WhiteHouse so this will allow financial advisors to gamble with your retirement for their profit not yours. Good move GOP NOT!
Wall street owns the GOP.
Afterward, Senate leaders cash checks from investment houses that own them.  Country or party, Senator?

Anti Stupidity??!!! Trump is epitome of Stupidity Bigly time.

Aww.Do u realize that he has been part of corruption 4 decades by buying politicans. Not a new broom
Proof? Who did he buy? Fake outrage much? Drain your own swamp.
Do you not remember him paying a fine for bribing the Attorney General of Florida??
Missing the good old days when banks could rip us off? Nostalgic for Bernie Madoff?  Destroying consumer protection 4 profit$.
@WhiteHouse so it's okay to have a USAchs cabinet???
Have you asked the people who lost their homes?Those not educated enough to understand what you now do. U need to care.
@WhiteHouse Wake up America. The fiduciary rule was put in place to protect you & your retirement $. Follow the $ into pocket.
Do you know WTF you're talking about? That rule was meant to protect investors from unscrupulous financial advisers. Whose side are you on?
@WhiteHouse My God, this rule is a cost center! Unhelpful to retirees!!!
Right! Retirees are better off when their retirement savings are fair game.
Great new for big business - remove the protections for americans vs predatory banks and companies. STOP THIS STUFF NOW!
Vote no on sessions
@WhiteHouse Is this post a joke? Stop big Gov't? How much is that wall costing?
@WhiteHouse risk losing reelection all Representatives and Congress people if you allow Trump to continue impeach Him asap
Breaking our laws going against Constitution  a threat to America and our allies almost treasonous
They really do get in the way of making money. Consumers should just do their jobs and shut up.
@WhiteHouse how does this help the least of us.
Clearly there is a double standard from the @ABC @CBS @NBC @CNN towards the WH in theses briefings MSM gave obama the pass,
This is the rule that would mandate that financial professionals act in their clients best interests, right? How is that a bad thing?
bc it prevents finance people from lining their pockets w your money. Bad business!  Sad!
.@SenatorEnzi @WhiteHouse So that working class Americans can continue to get ripped off. Shame on you.
C'mon Mike, you promote big business, reap investment $$ &  power grab despite long-term loss for American citizens.
@WhiteHouse Is that the same fiduciary rule that requires financial advisors to act in interest of their clients?
@WhiteHouse I think you spelled appalled wrong
Please work for your constituents and their children NOT your donors. Vote NO on Devos.
resign you are a washout
@WhiteHouse #oligarchy
@WhiteHouse No fiduciary rule helps the rich get richer! Screws the little guy! #oligarchy #GOLDMANSACHS
@WhiteHouse retirement planners & other related professionals will be legally obligated to put their clients' best interest 1st
not anymore! The rich won again--Thanks for fighting for the rich! #oligarchy #GOLDMANSACHS
This is inappropriate for the White House account. Also, Senator Enzi clearly hates the American people.
@WhiteHouse #snowflake #GOLDMANSACHS #puppet
You mean the rule that keeps banks in check to not SCREW THE MIDDLE CLASS?
STAND UP for the Wyoming children and #VoteNoDevos
@WhiteHouse how is acting in the best interest of your clients a bad thing? One so bad to applaud a decision to reverse it
Don't cry me a towel next election.
Success for billionaires, big banks ... and screw safeguards against another great recession.
Who wrote this thing? It says nothing. But I got the jist of it: it was finalized by Obama. Enough said. Rotten.

@WhiteHouse Taxpayers footing the bill for Eric's vacation. http://www.rawstory.com/2017/02/eric-trump-just-cost-taxpayers-97830-in-hotel-bills-for-a-corporate-trump-event-in-uruguay/ …
Big breaks for billionaires, great. Not what Trumpty promised. Or is Steve doing it all?

@JohnCornyn Do you know if your personal Investment Professional will adhere to the #fiduciaryrule? Might be time to find out.
@JohnCornyn We don't applaud it.  Tell the truth to the people less informed that you are selling out to Wall Street coward
And screw all small investors in the process. Bunch of big bank prostitutes, that's what you are.
You have got to be kidding. How much are they paying you to get behind this crap?
@WhiteHouse 
Oh the Left...YAWN
Getting happy for all this WINNING #MAGA 
@JohnCornyn GOP slaves to the 1%. They don't care about us. Shame.
What u call big government, consumers call 'protecting us from the worst in ethics in the financial field'.
the fiduciary ruling is bad for hard wprking Americans! You will pay come next election cycle
@JohnCornyn we the people don't. But you're sitting pretty so what do you care?
Why should financial planner consider my interest above his.  Duh?
@WhiteHouse POTUS Swampers r bailin fast*Goin on cnn 2 burn u =Skeptical McConnell distances from Trump on Russia, travel ban
@JohnCornyn SHAME! Didn't you learn from 2008? Or is Wall Street paying you off?
#gods hand is on you sir my @POTUS best ever #maga>
@WhiteHouse you mean Republicans, just #Republicans. #fakenews
Because heaven forfend a financial advisor should bear a fiduciary responsibility to his or her clients
REALLY???? THEY NEVER STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE
There will not be an easy day in the near future facing the mob goaded by paid anarchists. We must stay the course to peace.
All of US are watching and we see you care little for the working and middle class.  Shame on all of you!!!
Plz say no to DeVos! Do the right thing for children & hard-working teachers. Only qualification is money!
Enzi celebrates allowing Wallstreet to gamble away Senior Citizens retirement with-out responsibility. Shame on enzi shame #CNN
the people will vote you out next election How dare you celebrate giving Wallstreet free reign to ruin our seniors. SHAME! #CNN
Another looser #GOP  Enzi gave Wallstreet the right to gamble away our seniors retirement & not be punished #CNN Vote Enzi out!
EO on Wall St is precursor to repeal of prohibitions on risky trading. @realDonaldTrump won, not other 16!
I am so glad, i live in Canada
Did Trump said he will protect the American people?
I don't see you draining the swamp by eliminating the fiduciary rule that protect the investors.
This only helps Trump and his rich cronies. Trump sure knows how to put the "douche" back into "fiduciary."
Clapping because they will all make money.
Do you mean the rule that protected investors from being ripped off by financial institutions?
@WhiteHouse I am a Wyo citizen. You WILL NOT HAVE MY VOTE. How dare you put corporations over people.  #resistance #dissent.
@Secy_State_US yes, allow the fleecing of seniors! Great job
@WhiteHouse sure it's the putkin/trump traveling paid cheering group pathetic they need to get pre paid otherwise.....
@WhiteHouse   How can a rule protecting investors be bad for the people.
so all should get out of the stock market so goldman saches can't rip them off again.
stop assuming we're stupid. Your action does nothing to help me -one of the WY middle class. :-(
@WhiteHouse yea
@WhiteHouse Yup Protect and allow their profits to rule over responsibility to clients. Good job.
or the adult children of trump can spend tax payer dollers on there selfs. lets see your taxes
How is a rule that the adviser work in my best interest (rather than his/hers/its) a barrier to my planning?
@WhiteHouse trump is just a con artist very  dangerous
I like this because the regulators are useless.
@WhiteHouse #NotMyPresidentTrump #UnholyTrinity
@WhiteHouse @BarackObama vetoed Isakson, Alexander, Enzi, Hatch & 38 senators 56-41 resolution of disapproval. @POTUS @POTUS44
@WhiteHouse Boiler Room Operators all over Florida, cheer as Trump allows naked options for retirees!

@WhiteHouse I would like fiduciary mandates from my investment broker, and political representatives, please.
of course rich white men applaud an open road to screwing hard working Americans out of their retirement
do you have any of your own ideas or do you constantly tow the party line?
@WhiteHouse because why would we stipulate that an advisor on someone's hard-earned retirement assets be trustworthy?!
@WhiteHouse then they should be ashamed of themselves
@WhiteHouse Small investors who can't trust brokers to act as fiduciaries now will love it 2.
@WhiteHouse thanks Joe for clarity on meaning of fiduciary
@WhiteHouse what does that word mean
@WhiteHouse allowing rich people to fleece working people of their hard earned money! Which big business giving Enzi a job?
@WhiteHouse Thank you for working so hard for all Americans.  God bless you.
@WhiteHouse @SenateGOP thank you senators for protecting your constituents #nonotreally
@WhiteHouse #TheUsEra >)
Yeah, @SenatorEnzi, because that's big gummint that says "We'd like to pump the brakes on you nailing your customers from behind."
especially in a model that says "you can't retire unless you invest" simultaneously with "you can't invest unless you lube."
@WhiteHouse this is not about president or America it's about who got more money or power
@WhiteHouse  why people are wasting time and energy trying to go against Millionaires and billionaires Money talk bullshit walk
@WhiteHouse that is terrible. Why shouldn't a financial adviser be required to act in the best interest of their client?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS yes bravo!!  Because the collapse of 2008 was simply phenomenal! #KingTrump
@WhiteHouse A win for big business.  A lose for the rest of us. You are bad people!
@WhiteHouse  Bring the recession back!!
@WhiteHouse .here comes a depression
@WhiteHouse
And it’s back to raping the planet we go! Eventually not even you #Drumpf will be able to deny the damage you do!
@WhiteHouse what are the trumpets screwing the U S scary and liars they are

@WhiteHouse
http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/3/14414362/trump-cabinet-golden-parachute …
So no more rules to play by. Wall Street can do again what they want and the Americans can bail them out. I think not
SAD! This rule protected citizens from dishonest financial planners. Pres Trump is not protecting us.
Thank You Senator! Let's please get this cabinet 100% confirmed!

@WhiteHouse Dinosaurs, the extinction is coming.
@WhiteHouse   Must be hard to applaud while grabbing all that Wall Street cash with both hands. #sellouts
explain how that makes him a crook?
@WhiteHouse remind me how removing a rule requiring retirement advisors to act in their clients' best interest is good for us?
@WhiteHouse great move cuz most Americans have a phalanx of lawyers /accountants sitting with them to make financial decisions
@WhiteHouse https://twitter.com/Hope2Pete/status/827690351200661504 …
This is about people getting cheated out of their savings. Big government was the only way to stop the greed.
Yea the senate is full rich old men who can give 2 shits about the rest of America!
@WhiteHouse Will find list of who voted in favor.  4 years and the American People will start draining the swamp.
@WhiteHouse They will all be fueling the fires together!
@WhiteHouse If they steal people's money, oh well. If they lie and mislead consumers.
@WhiteHouse great move. I hope the WH is going to NOT bail them out again!!!!! If they fail so be it.
@HighVoltageNews see he's delivering. should see tax planPOTUS already wrapping up pedophiles rings.once sessions confirmed
@WhiteHouse ...or..."Wall Street Celebrates While Regular People Wonder 'What Is Going On?'"
...or..."Good For Most People In Wyoming?"

Sure, why should the government protect the populace from financial criminals not acting in our interests?
@WhiteHouse Trump Travel Ban, Collasal f**k up beyond Epic Proportions. Failure at the highest level!
. Way to take care of your people, let Wall Street cheat us!
Thank you sir! It's nice to hear we can all work together! God bless you!
can you explain to me how removing this rule helps the American people?
As an American who still hasn't recovered from the 2008 crisis, you just gave Wall Street & banks permission to do again!  #ass
@WhiteHouse
RETWEET this so that Trump supporters can get in on this poll too. 

Two weeks in, do you like Trump More or Less? PLEASE PARTICIPATE!!!
.    Yes, lets allow corporations to screw over the little man once again like they did under Bush.  Enzi u are corrupt!
@WhiteHouse. Basically they cancelled Obama's rule that financial advisors HAD to act in the best interest of their clients
@WhiteHouse We remember the viticms, thank you @KellyannePolls!
@WhiteHouse @GOP chosen party over country. 2018 just around the corner, you better watch out, you're getting voted out.
yeah, Dodd-Frank REALLY inhibited the market. You're disingenuous.
@WhiteHouse Idiots!
@WhiteHouse This from a member of the party not in the pockets of business. So heartwarming his concern for consumers' savings.
@WhiteHouse. So its ok with you that the people lose. It was done to protect us.
@WhiteHouse and this illegitimate scoundrel cares about the working man, yeah right. Malignant narcissist @realDonaldTrump
so whats that mean, no wall?, no tax cuts for the rich?
@WhiteHouse Stocks are fine. MOST Americans are not "in the market" except retire accts. How about $ in OUR pockets now? DoddFr
@WhiteHouse so you're financial advisor can screw you??
Thanks for encouraging greed and the destruction of the middle class.
you are crooks starting with @POTUS @KellyannePolls
Yes, lets repeal this rule that helps protect the investor, so the advisor can line their pockets!
Yes, because why would you ever want to force your fin. advisor to work in your best interests rather than lining their pockets
@WhiteHouse hahaha never leftists never
