And to help for any future natural disasters, please stop voting Republican........ya know the ones cutting funding for #FEMA
Leave ur mother out of this
Just tired of people like you ruining my country into the ground
Please also remember animal rescue orgs who are helping house & care for displaced pets.
If you'd like a list of organizations that I believe to be reliable and can manage large amounts of money in the Houston area, please follow
Will you address climate change and #divest from fossil fuels? And commit to a green economy?
We think everyone should! One way we can take action is to use our investment portfolio to divest!
@PDMFNB @kellykimberley35 not much? Or r u just a troll. Either way my answer is 2Timothy 2:33-24. Have a better life dear
Donate to the Red Cross, not the Big Labor SEIU
Do you give free aid to Illegal Aliens? If yes, I will find a way to get my help to legal Citizens and residents.

The Islamic Society of Houston needs donations as all the mosques are open for food, shelter, clothing to people of ANY COLOR AND RELIGION.
Go to http://www.samaritanspurse.org  & you can find specific places to donate money, time & needed esssentials. FEMA will make people take vaccines
Pretty sure that the best way is to vote out @KenCalvert and vote in Democrats to raise taxes on the wealthy and then help those in need.
DNC PLATFORM SHOULD BE:FREE HEALTHCARE+FREE COLLEGE+DBL MIN WAGE-WEALTHY PAY FOR ALL
WHO wouldn't vote for that Republican or Democrat right? And we've learned at least one thing – the GOP represent the wealthy 1% no one else
Consider Salvation Army. During disaster they draw from their budget so 100% of donations go to relief efforts.
You might as well be donating to a greedy church...their mission does not support the LGBT community.
Red Cross/Fema/most orgs do nothing for sanitary needs of babies & seniors. Texas Diaper Bank/Islamic Society of Houston good charities.
How can I connect for help? FEMA why are yall taking so long to help me?
I no more want **
This reminds me of undertale
The Texas Diaper Bank is a GREAT cause. Red Cross/FEMA/many orgs do not address the sanitary needs of babies and seniors.
WATCH OUT for Clinton Criminal Foundations!
Please explain
how do I donate clothing and goods??
@HoustonTX might be able to assist
Why not stabilize flood insurance program & adequately fund FEMA relief instead of pushing those government responsibilities to charities?
Donated for Houston Texas 
#HurricaneHarvey 
Another good resource:
Excellent!   Thank you.
If you'd like to help people,have the GOP's party of the 1% wealthy send money immediately! There's really no need for you to be taking our
Trump taught us the rich don't pay for shit and we pay for everything so we're going to stop by withholding our federal taxes next year!
I would not sent a dime to FEMA or RED CROSS both laundry alot of money between them.  Watched to during Katrina
Thanks
$1.5 Billion for boarder security, yet Mexico has supported our people in times of needed.
@DonaldJTrumpJr , @EricTrump , @IvankaTrump  just sending some info your way in case you were interested in donating......
# Lalique Salon Flagler Beach Florida is going to do all free cuts , all we ask is donations, all of it will be sent to Texas, will postdate

TEXANS: File insurance for hurricane damage BEFORE SEPT 1, when new law goes into effect making harder for consumers to claim. 
Our biggest disaster is pharmaceutical profiting 
off Opioids in America 
 Opioid deaths are an epidemic in America and illegal drug deaths

We're praying! @realDonaldTrump 
How to help!! #HurricaneHarvey victims

And you can really help them by paying their flood claim FAIRLY. I waited 4YEARS after Sandy and still was robbed. Many still waiting
Thank you for this.
I don't trust FEMA or giving $, I prefer to donate water & goods

http://texasbaptistmen.org/Ministries/Disaster-Relief …

Should I make a donation to help Texans to The Clinton Foundation? Incredible org that rebuilt Haiti has to be the place to donate, right?
Hey Sarah we got this we don’t need your help.
Trump scrapped flood protection standards days before Harvey
Don't give money to the crooked red cross. Find some other form of donation.
And not @facebook

The Police Force is taking donations! Them I trust.
Please help. God bless https://www.gofundme.com/hurricane-harvey-jron-dice?lang=en-US …
Do not give to go fund me accounts!!!!
Why is that sir ? This is for our community. The whole neighborhood is damaged and we want to help our friends.
Because many go fund me accounts are scams. VOAD's are legitimate 501(c)(3) organizations who have a history.
Oh okay thank you. I've never used a go fund me before. Is there any other way I can make an account?
Pick a recognized VOAD of FEMA's list and direct financial support to it. VOAD's come in many flavors and philosophies but they're vetted.
Sound advice. #Californians stand united, beside #Texas #HurricaneHarvey
We can all do something.  Red Cross, food banks, do without our lattes for a week & donate the cash to red cross.
Donate! This is a bipartisan effort to help our fellow Americans. There will be time to squabble later on ideology and issues. #USA #Harvey
Media already fueling the stress of the price at the pumps. It's CENTS on a $. Little do they know they are doing their part. Why complain
We cant donate money but want to give our time and service. Father is general contractor, I/we want to help rebuild Houston. Tell us how
WITH SUPPORT GOOD WORDS,GOD CREATE EASINESS FOR ALL DISASTER EFFECTED OF HUSTON TEXES AMARICA NON MUSLIM,MUSLIM EVERY HUMAN.
Sending ANY amount you can,they need every penny they can get! Your money could save a life, or two, or more. The more you send, the better.
Please make Donations to Samaritans Purse, they're a reputable charity, rest assured your donation will help many
Please 
Would you guys consider helping @JoelOsteen with dry clothes, sheets and food for cold, wet, hungry people near his church?
I LIVE IN MINDEN LA WE R OPENING OUR  2 SMALL FAM PLZ IF U WNT A CLEAN LUVING   2 REST TILL #FEMA GETS U GOIN WE R HERE INBOX ME PLZ
Trump can spend millions on travel/golf/vacation, but u ask 4 donations to help victims! R u serious rt now!!!! Unbelievable
Maybe you can respond faster to the insurance claims? @POTUS
He don't do the insurance claim DA
FEMA is a taxpayer organization that paid you money to handle this and you are now asking for donations really?
Donate to @SalArmyEDS
@SpeakerRyan how about you spend the wall money on houston
Help Harvey victims Now, afterwards it's nonsensical & a capitalism bonanza.

>>Callin all friends & family to offer help is what is needed!
Montrose Grace Place provides food, clothing & community to homeless queer youth. http://montrosegraceplace.org/donate.html 
How to help: Dump Trump & disastrous administration trying to gut FEMA & other vital agencies. Another questionable appt in FEMA Director.
Hahahaha! U are such a cliche, Troll. 2 followers!! 
¿Are you going to accept the help from mexican people?
Can you mention any help USA has sent to Mexico for disasters? PS.
I can write what I want.
I wasn't talking to you.
You are on twitter so public. US has helped on every earthquake & other disasters for decades. Do own research, I'm busy in Houston area.
"Every earthquake"oh please.Other disasters? u can't even mention 1.I won't do research 4something u brought up.That wasn't the point anyway
Need some help for neighbors in friendswoid. They are running out of food and supplies. Could we get them some help please.
absolutely,i&my great beauty @margbrennan discussed,agree,provide more help & support,rescue operation,emergency issues,affected by #Harvey
trusted organizations.. bs.. only 1 % goes to help the other pays the CEO Pay. if you want to help, give to the people that need the help.
Many of the organizations on the list are good organizations. Some like the Red Cross will always seem shady.
Send it to Red Cross?    Can't trust most "charitable organizations".
Repeal Obamacare would help
yeah, because we all know FEMA isn't going to do shit
Please keep your distressing comments to yourself during this natural disaster instead maybe lend a helping hand to folks that needs it.
Look buddy we're both on Twitter, so
Yeah Chuck! She has a Twitter account, so she can be an asshole if she wants to. It's her God-given right. Go FEMA!
Thank you for your support
OOPS!
Regret you voted for trump
Nope
Where to first responder volunteers report?
Any organizations making a trip from the Philly area to Texas. I don't have money to donate but I can donate clothing.
#DonateBlood  It costs nothing but your time #PrayersforTexas #HurricaneHarvey #TexasFlood

Such a negative statement from a negative person.
