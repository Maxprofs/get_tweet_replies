You leave #Cleveland & go somewhere else & you guys are Struggling, That new team is not going to reload that team in the same year..CAVS has something with you but You have something with the Cavs & that is #CONTROL.. U Control that organization, The Lakers u will never Control
If you have any Sense at all #Lebron you will not leave the #Cavs,, If that Brooklyn pick is a top 4 pick, U would be a fool to leave with adding that other piece with u at the Helm, U make average players look like All-Stars and Rookies look like Rookies of the Year, #Cedi
cuz you’ve seen me wear em before

Use your crossover and focus on what's Real! Stop looking for the spotlight/narrative and you'll be the GOAT !
@CashNastyGaming about to go on a search for these shoes
Why does David H. Koch fund the @PBS show NOVA through his science foundation? They want to destroy public  education and fill colleges with right wing ideologues. David koch funded @PBS documentary reconstructed history to make a queen of Africa look like a Caucasian women.!
Dope
My boys have worn the king James shoes... way old but good kicks
Fire
@AstronautKI
Damn. Fresh.
If you had a chance to redo any Jordan shoe  what would it be
Jordan II
Listen Up King,Wat could stop You ,AD ,and Boogie from winning a ring ,Nothing only thing that could is  You not signing

wow whats stinks around here lol
@KingJames I recall playing against you . Well I was on the bench a juvenile at a place called GJR we were the tigers we won in overtime . And I was hype of course but seeing you then and seeing you now you were a junior in high school ready for the world . Respect bro
This reeeel shit..
U still got these these
Lebron X "Volt" icies
Is LeBron James the GOAT


Shoulda been a and 1

I wish I have one
Oh boy some sneakers.
I’m pretty sure I’m the only person who owns this. Mind signing it for me?
More like king entitled bitch
apparently Africans come from white people according to David koch!!!
Mas e o lance livre ? Aprendeu a bater ?
Rola uma disputa na timeline do Cavs: @CavsDepre persegue mais o @KingJames sacaneando toda postagem do #23 ou @FelipeGatti11 reclama mais do técnico campeão Ty Lue 
Certeza que eu ganho essa disputa aí
Você é mais antigo na causa. Porém ela tem certa justificativa. O @CavsDepre resolveu stalkear o King... Acho que é pelo block, que nunca ocorrerá porque o LBJ não lê tweet. Porém, ser bloqueado no Twitter pelo King daria imortalidade ao nosso Depre...
Tô doido por um block
Block by James
Sort of like these joints I've kept on ice since '07...Worm about 11X but in immaculate condition. ..Hardest shoe eva I've copped-

How’s your sister Hillary Clinton?
I love you James.
U should keep Cedi Osman as starter guy is everywhere on the pitch.G.Hill is awesome too.Defense wins chapionchips.
You are such a beast on the basketball court!!  Love watching you!! I’m very glad you got back out there and played after you got hurt today
You know who else are kings like you?

Cleveland Cavilers-----new team is dangerous

They blew Boston out

The Cavs crushed the Celtics.

The new lineup is scary good.
Lots of athleticism.
