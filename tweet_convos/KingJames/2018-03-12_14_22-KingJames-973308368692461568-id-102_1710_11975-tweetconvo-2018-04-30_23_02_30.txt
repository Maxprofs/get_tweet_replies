"You start to see this explosive guy — he emerges onto the scene and starts performing magic." - @Drake on how @MrVinceCarter15 influenced ball in Toronto.

Smh @mrvincecarter15 doesnt get talked about as much as he deserves!!! #HOFer
NBA hofr. A true great.

How is a jump shooter leading the lead in free throws attempts @NBA y’all need to fix this shit @KingJames if I was you I would be straight up tripping that makes the game weak like every time someone shoots a J just a little touch it’s a foul @KingJames be getting closed lined
Half man half  amazing
Curry gonna get one of these in a 30 for 30 version in 20 years


great defensive communication by "the leader of the Cavaliers" last night
Please put on a show in Portland
Hey lebron im big fan of yours but tell your teammates either step up or step out there’s my playoff advice
See you tmrw in Phoenix! Surprising my boy for his 8th birthday! Awe he’s gonna love it 
Will one NBA Star endorse a cool sneaker collection that inner city kids can afford. Sneakers over $300?  That is a family’s rent in some places.
LeBron to the Raptors
One of the most exciting players to watch EVER!
Any donation can help me with my medical bills

#WeMadeIt  #wethenorth
Also blatantly quit on the team. No excuses for that
@RegularKel
Good looks.
Vince might be the best dunker of all-time.Better then M.J, Dominique, Kobe, Yourself and even Dr.J
Why yall just give up against the Lakers last night tho? Every time I.T hit a bucket and stared yall bench down I told myself Bron is gonna take his heart soon... Then you proceeded to sit half the game? Was you hurt or something. Yall gave them a freebie for real.
LeBron to the Kings confirmed
You cant just give us this one for free? Isnt nike paying you like a billion dollars already??
come to the @Raptors
Like and RT if Lebron could do that and Kobe couldn’t
That is so true
Awesome respect, @KingJames!
https://instagram.com/p/BgOso66lcSp/  pls watch
You could do that, Kobe couldn’t
The shoes had you thinking you could have bunnies like VC! We love you always putting people on LeBron you're an inspiration! S/o from the go big team! #StriveForGreatness #LLTK

U should have done a dunk contest in your career

Quick Poll which averages are better:

Player A ~ 23.6 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 1.1 APG on 42, 37, 80 shooting splits in 35 MPG…
Oh shit it’s finally out??
Better dunker than Vince tbh
You're my role model bro. I'm your biggest fan. Even naming my first child LeBron.
I'm naming my first child LeBron and middle name James. I don't care what my wife says, it's 100% happening. Always paying homage and showing appreciation to the GOAT. #LongLiveTheKing
