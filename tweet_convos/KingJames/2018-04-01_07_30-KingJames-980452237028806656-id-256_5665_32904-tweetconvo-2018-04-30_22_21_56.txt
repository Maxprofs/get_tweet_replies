#GetLebronToPdubsJerseyRetirement
He ran like he stole a pair of Nikes or something.#FreeShoesUniversity
老詹我爱你
As long as it wasn’t because of David Boston
You should release an FSU version of the Lebron 15’s. I’d be all over that!
@JordonVaden 

Tennessee locked him DOWN in the ‘98 Natty
Natty’s since then: FSU 2 Vols 0
Peter Warrick should sue you for copyright infringement.

Knee injuries will do that
He played on a terrible Bengals team with no talent surrounding him
So damn exciting to watch! One of a kind!!

Maaaannn you wore that #7 first tho 
Roll call!! Born on Jan 9....there’s 9 letters in Capricorn...then it was Tony Rice, Rodney Peete, Major Harris up to Peter Warrick @ FSU while I was playing WR @SFSU  that #9 has always been special. Big ups Peter Warrick


That’s beast mode
Y'all will do anything to steal the #King .. Even his thoughts
HAPPY EASTER TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
P-Dub!

@CoachTaggart  gotta get @KingJames down to a #DoSomething practice
As a Southeast HS graduate I love this.  PW made every Friday night HS game rememberable!
Being in the end zone stands he was running to there was something I’ll never forget

Would’ve ran away with the Heisman if not for Dillard’s. 

Ran. Away.

He was a beast at FSU, but he was drafted by the wrong nfl team
One of the greatest WR in college history
NFL bust!
@Jooz_4187 @itschinoofooly @aruiz_22
Warrick =  Lebron not so much
LeBron going to the Spring game 
#salute 
@aturko_23
I’m now a Lebron fan hah
#salute
He was the truth when I was at FSU!! Go Noles
My all time favorite Seminole. Beast
Dub step is ALL I need to say. There are so many victims of it! Congrats man.
@DroOyg 5-1-3  original
Lebron stopped playing football once he realized you can’t flop in that sport to get your way
LeBron wore 6 while he was in Miami bc a 6 is a 9 upside down and 69
He was so good at FSU
I wonder if Peter Warrick knows this?! That’s awesome trivia.
Love labron!!!!!
@nikestore we need a @pdub80 FSU jersey drop

Still wish we could have seen you in Garnet & Gold and @RandyMoss in G&G longer.
@FSUFootball #144 

Respect...don’t know why this man gets slept on so much. One of the best to do it
@cayleb_knox
@Cgriffin3323 ant
Are you congratulating him for having his number retired or for having you wear his number?
You love my Noles, such a great feeling. Hope you go to an FSU game in Doak one day bro.
Happy Easter LeBron!  Hope you have a great day!
I got that rookie card baby @cjolly5
@FloridaThomas 
Imagine him in today’s offense in the slot man oh man......dude would be in the HOF
COLD.......boy had moves on top of moves
Much love 
First Bengals Jersey I ever bought! #Whodey
Ayoo LeBron! Are there high school tapes of u playing football? You could have been the megatron before there was a Megatron in Calvin Johnson
Lebron’s an fsu fan confirmed
U on know nothing bout Florida state I loved them and this team was why Peter warrick and Warwick Dunn
You still have eligibility left.  Come play football for the Garnett and gold! Haha #pipedreams
PETER WARRICK AND WARRICK DUNN WERE REAL @KingJames 
Whoa
That boy’s cut and stop on a dime game was VICIOUS!
That's why he blew both knees out smh
Ya boy @MarcWhiteman
can’t even hate. He was a human highlight reel ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Wow so nice
He was a Wide Out. I am not good at football, but that is on offense?
Calculated. He will turn up in the playoffs. Watch.
And you beat us in OT at West branch
My frame of reference will always be Madden 04 btw. I base my life on it.
Haha I didn’t see this one. If I could go back to one time in my life it would probably be 2003 so we can play madden 04 and never sleep again
Dude agreed. I wonder what PriestDog is doing these days 
I always wondered why Laveranues Coles (FSU during the same time) was 88 overall and 97 speed in madden 04 if he was drafted 3rd round but Warrick was drafted 4th overall 
Lol you are on a madden 04 binge right now...
He wasn’t a bust in the NFL but definitely should have done more though actually maybe he was a bust I mean 4th overall pick
I never knew you were a Note @KingJames . Welcome to NoleNation!
Still my fav FSU player war rick Dunn close 2nd
Damn.. I literally thought Warrick was trash bc in madden 04 he was only 80 overall and only 87 speed.
@Pdub80
Yeah right.
@martinmorvles
How’d he do against the Vols?
I thought it was because of this guy.
@IsaiahPClark

@blbLXXXII
That boy cold!!!!
Bleed scarlet and red though?
That’s right!!!! #Noleblooded
@Pdub80 this Taylor
Those were some great FSU teams including number 28!
Damn bro u making me a dub feel old however we both don’t look it 
Peter Warrick #9 congrats, my favorite college football era ever next to the usc Reggie bush era #facts
Everybody wanted to be like @Pdub80 back then!  He was the best, it was between him and @RandyMoss Randy moss is the reason I went to marshall!
Real cool dudeevery year summer workouts.
Real recognize real
These young cats don’t know
Bron is one of us
Probably the same reason you “travel”
@Patpoose4real as if you were not already a big enough lebron dick rider lmao
Real recognize real

Too bad he left all his talents at fsu
@AndrewTrujillo5
Same!
He was the truth still don't get his NFL career

 + !!!! Go noles and go cavs!!!
Always have to make it about you
@TomTuttle24
He was a beast, but then couldn’t control his crap on the nfl
He was my favorite I had almost all his rookie cards
Definitely 1 of the dopest college wr of all time
WTH too you all so long @FSUFootball  #legend 
@samgododge @taroontino such a beast
Imagine him lined up across from Randy Moss lol
I am a fellow Southeast High School Alum. Peter graduated a year after me. He was the that couldn’t be stopped #amazing #classof94
James wears HandsUpDon’tShoot shirt in front of millions. Obama’s DOJ proves Michael Brown did NOT have hands up, did NOT say don’t shoot, “witnesses” admitted they lied about it & FACTS show cop’s version is truth. James refuses 2 apologize, continues to show true racist colors
@ryshultz15 @CoachFisherr @GOAT_XIII @StephenHigginzz
@VictorTang82 I knew I forgot someone
@dmm5157
@dontae_2times
He know a GOAT when he see one
He had that punt return to beat the Chiefs
I remember, he was awesome!
Hell yea
@npappas6

He a thief. #crimiNOLES
Learn something new everyday I was a youngin when he won the heisman
