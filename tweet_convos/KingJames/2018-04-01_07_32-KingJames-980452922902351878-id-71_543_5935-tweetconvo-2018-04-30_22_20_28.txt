That doesn’t look like over 90 state championships #UAAllTheWay #GoldenBears #NiceTryTho 
Baha, you talking youth? 90 state championships in one sport at the high school level has never happened... Ever!
116 overall. Sit down 

MR JAMES - PLEASE VISIT :http://obamadayaugust4.com 
Congrats to the winners

Dude it’s a private school shut up

Don’t you think private schools should be in a different conference than public schools? That would only make it fair .
you are my favorite star! Love you so much!
Hope you can take the NBA champion of 2018
Waiting for more @KingJames  ;
Too bad you weren’t in town. What a surprise tribute that would have been to the team. Boss man Mr.Tom Carone would have loved it!
At least the High School Team in Ohio will get a ring this year
