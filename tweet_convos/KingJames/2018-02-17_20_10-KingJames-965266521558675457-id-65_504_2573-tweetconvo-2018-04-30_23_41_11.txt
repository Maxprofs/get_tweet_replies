What @IngrahamAngle suggested that you do is the same attitude the right had under @GeorgeWBush__  Now they're doing it again under @realDonaldTrump .These people lied us into Iraq and caused #TheGreatRecession . They don't want anyone reminding them how much they suck at country
Librel loudmouth LeBron we don't like the elites, don't like the elites, don't like the elite librels lecturing us STOP you Micheal Moore, Hillary Clinton don't care about America, only illegals for VOTES patrotic black Americans & white American don't care about skin tone

I know deep down you guys were laughing at @Fergie


Once again you money grubbers show your hand in applying the english word:  "I am MORE than an athlete" .  "More" is a catchall word to cover quantity. You're lazy with the word even though it butters your bread. You'd rather repeat the same lines than create unheard of ones.
Come on LeBron. Go debate Laura. She will eat you for lunch.


Good to see he is leaving the Dick Pics off of social media! #NBAAllStar
Lebron is more than a basketball player he has a wife and children and foundations affected by what the President do and say he has a right as everyone does to speak his mind,who is she to be conversing with him she isn’t no important person.
LeBron James is only considered important because he throws a ball through a hoop like a trained seal.

@KingJames @mavcarter Great work!
Where in LA?
@KingJames @warriors @Money23Green @mavcarter @uninterrupted
Lebron and durant say they support people. Yet they support uber ? Lol pathetic. Uber treats the drivers almost as bad as slaves its insane

NEW VIDEO!! "The Left Thinks Black People Are Stupid". Watch the full video here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KrwmLH8QD7I … 
Say and do what you want LaBron! That fool in the WH tweets all kinds of foolishness and lies constantly while we're sleeping.
Lebron sucks!

#wewontshutupanddribble
LeBron you can say whatever you like ... but don’t be a Big P&@$y when someone comments back.   Be a man ... just like when Cam Newton commented funny to hear a female reporter comment about routes ..  that was funny and as a female I didn’t lose my mind .. “lighten up Francis”

@KingJames you get paid millions of dollars to play basketball!! Not bash the president 24/7! Grow up you little baby, and be thankful for what you have. There’s millions of people that wish they had 1/30 of your money!!
So getting paid millions makes the rights of him not express himself lol
I’m just saying he should be the last one complaining about the world. He’s living his life perfectly right now doing what he loves the most, while making millions of dollars

.@cavs shouldn't be surprised when season ticket holders don't renew & ticket sales decline. We are fed-up with LeBron & his disrespectful antics. We don't go to games to be preached to by an out-of-touch multi-millionaire. #ShutUpAndDribble
This is “real”, when a player takes some people from his community with him, and they prosper, and give more underprivileged people better opportunities in life, this is “real life” going on
Dude. speak for yourself. @KingJames is no different than @realDonaldTrump Both GIVE money to charity, don't act like it makes lebron a patron saint, end of day, I don't see him knocking on my door helping me out of my struggles or sending me to school. real life #hedontcare
#ShutUpAndDribble
You don’t mean nuttin
Hopefully no refs around or green will cry like a baby.
Hopefully no players around too otherwise they gonna need an NC17 rating when drey starts grabbing at them players balls.
Wonderful!!! @KingJames You are Sooooooo Inspiring You & @mavcarter are making so many #BossMoves We need you in our Lives because Black America & the world continues to turn with Great Minds like Yours. #MavCarter has a very nice smile also The #TeethHall OfFame 
All this from a guy who in his City a four year old girl was shot why don't you do something about black on black crime instead of running your neck about s*** you don't know about shut up and dribble
Do you realize what he does for the community before you run yours?
Why don't you list the ways and then tell me what he does for his government
He first launched one of the most giving school programs in the community he grew up in, and now he is launching a charter school, for starters. He speaks, donates his time to causes for young men and women, he has a right to have his opinion, just like you. You think he doesn’t?
You just answered my question why would I want a POS like Gibran lames teaching school kids anything especially when he can't even respect the president. If you can't respect the country the flag and the position of presidency you're the last person I want teaching anybody's kids
So you want American children to learn dissent is wrong?
Lol..Laura Ingram who. Oops. Dunk sorry Laura but we wil keep  you I'm prayer. These gentleman  have more important things to do but deal with your rhetoric
Oops it's Laura Ingraham who?
