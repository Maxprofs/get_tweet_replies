Dumb comment
Come to lakers lebron

Stick to basketball politics ain't ur court @IngrahamAngle  put smack down on ur wanna be political comments

La bum u r no doubt an amazing person and athlete. But can u please have the balls to bring awareness to black on black crime in our inner cities. #itsnottrumpsfault
Lebron is the same as @lindseyvonn. Only less masculine. #ShutUpAndDribble #TrumpIsYourPresident #maga #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
So now Laura Ingraham is racist because she said something you didn't like but most of America agrees with?Toughen up snowflake. Your race card has expired. You're still selling, but no one is buying. LeBron & his left-wing nutjobs be like:
Delonte wore this and nothing else while banging your mom
Aye bron I been in an argument with some fools over whether or not you deserve top 1 or 2 spots in the GOAT debate surely as one of the best to play the game you can tell these suckers that Wilt Bill and MJ were all better than you

It'd look good on you, put it on and SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE.  You have nothing more then a hood High School education, we really need to take political advice from a guy who couldn't make it into a college.  Go get yourself an education and may-be you will have some credentials.
King James, you've been challenged to have some serious political discourse.  You gonna man up or just keep trash talkin?
stoooopid lebrick shames. Go reed a book lebwrong.
Lebrick James is an uneducated voter. Part of the problem in this country is the lack of education from athletes.  They are brainwashed and the sad part is that they have no idea how stupid they are.
@KingJames the #Llamas are coming you'll be like #EmilioEstevez #MightyDucks @SEC #MightyLlamas all the way @marchmadness #GoLlamas @DalaiLama @LamaSuryaDas @CU_Bruce_Benson @NaropaU @NaropaAlumni @murraystateuniv @MurrayStatePrez @raceralumni @RacerDave23 @murraystate @MSURacers
Shout out to my 2018 MVP Glad You Stayed in ALB DDBSF2026 @KingJames @albertaalbertxy  http://www.albertaalbert.my90forLife.com 
@KingJames gud job yesterday at da all star game team lebron wtf is a curry
Glad you like it! Let's make you a King James varsity jacket!
LeBron the comment that Laura Ingram made was no different than any comments she makes about a white person Dissing the president. You let the mainstream media twist everything. Do your research they messed up with their advice to you.
its suddily a discriminatory comment, saying people like you don't have the right to speak.
Hey LeBron when you learn to speak proper English and stop cursing at public events I might listen to what you have to say,but then again you play with a ball for a living so maybe not
Is that what you come back with. LeBron had a 2.8 in high school and didn't go to college.he bounces a ball for a living. He needs to stick with that and leave more complicated things to people with an education

Yes, you do. That’s why you took the time to comment.
You mean nothing to society. You are entertainment and nothing more.
Doesn't have the stones to get embarrassed on TV. That high school degree that somebody gave him, would be trashed after @IngrahamAngle got finished with him.
LOL. KangJames

Be like @KingJames ignorant 2.0. #TheGreatAwakening
Jacket is Shap
You are correct, “Super Dope”.
Come to Croatia,you'll be surprised
Nice to see a video without Kevin Hart in it.  Speaking of videos check this one out-
Jacket is killer!

Doing well Tonight LBJ ALB DDBSF2026

Kevin Love loves himself some Kevin Love

You’re a shining example and a very good man.
Will Gloria and Delonte West be in attendance tonight for the big game? I know Delonte takes his step daddy role pretty serious

That jacket is dope.!
Where is that Lake O varsity jacket Kev?  Don’t forget your Laker roots
@kevinlove
What have you guys done for the victims in Florida? Other than talk smack about Trump. #Crickets
Lebron and durant say they support people. Yet they support uber ? Lol pathetic. Uber treats the drivers almost as bad as slaves its insane
Black on black murder? Where is your & the black community outrage? Crickets
Being a Bruin is special. #championsmadehere
LeBron James: the ingraham woman is an idiot. You already know that. She spews lies for a living. I just see a slithering green column of bile with dancing demons on her shoulders dripping her vicious lies. She only wishes she could dribble.
Shut up and dribble dummy.

大家不要在老詹的推特下面刷雷迪克 根本就不管老詹的事！
You should’ve joined him! You would’ve been in this picture with him
Looks like @CalFootball has something to say about this color scheme and lettering (C) on that Varsity jacket...
Cal was the 1st UC school. All UC schools use this jacket to honor Cal.

#ShutUpAndDribble
Lebron！How do you think about the word “Chink”
that JJ redick said in the new year video?
Its also a kind of racism right？
Attention all "role models", quit using the word "DOPE" as a term for good. It conditions the minds and sends the wrong message.
redick apologize
I am you a super fans from China,I hope you can make success in the all star
https://twitter.com/realsaavedra/status/965065868370575360 …
“Alot of people was uneducated”  
Shut up and dribble
As a Chinese fans, hope you can say some words about JJ Redick using "chink" in the video blessing the CNY. Just like what u did on H&M.
See? Just dribble ya big baby!!
Economy booming, stock market at all time high, ISIS on the run, illegal crossings down significantly at the border, 3-4 % GDP growth, unemployment lowest in 30 years, black unemployment lowest in history, over 70 judges placed and largest tax cut in decades. Suck on some facts.
But Trump doesn't care about people you say? What college did you go to? Oh that's right... If you couldn't jump you would be flipping burgers.

Can wait til you back to boston. So I can scream “dribble” courtside louder then ever!
Rude: that was the dumbest hippiest liberal  response ever. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
love is handsome
I am your Chinese fan!  Good luck all star  game
@BarstoolBigCat Breaking News! Kev is back on the cool thrown!!
Brons right @PRocque11
You spew up vile languages in public. A little child had to asked his parents what does the N and F word means? Why does this guy LeBron James keeps saying the N and F word so much? Parents had to explain to the child that the basketball players have a very low IQ knowledge. 
Because he’s only a little athlete and nothing else.
I am so upset to see the Videohttp://video.weibo.com/show?fid=1034:207bd53ebc6945bb23d2213847d70ee3
#ShutUpAndDribble
U gonna cry Lebron?? 
#Shutupanddribble!
Hey Hillary Buttboy you should go on Wayne Dupree show and show everybody how uninformed you are! And Laura Ingram invited you on the show, i don't think thats trying to silence you! Coward
Everything LeBron James does or involves himself in is about color. It’s a shame that a person of his stature thrives on racism. Notice I didn’t say ‘man’ because it’s obvious he falls short in this category.
Sorry you had to put up with all that BS from that woman, Inhad never heard if her before all this. 

Happy Sunday! Many Blessings your way from Washington State
Lean English.
*Learn
see redick video?
Lebron...you of all people should know what it's like to be judged when the talking heads haven't even MET you....but YOU are guilty of the same ???? You have never sat down with and MET Trump...you don't know his heart...you are judging based on TV and political comments..cmon??
@UCLAAthletics you more handsome than love，i love you and love，hope our love will play game quickly。
Kevin love, the model
Bron if you think the jacket is great, just wait til you see his chinos!! I about #sheeshed myself the first time I saw one of his BR commercials......

Lebron James: No one should be shooting "assault" weapons!
LeBron - the NOISEY EMPTY BARREL of the NBA...shut up and dribble !
2018 champs
Love ya Kevin
Lebron self proclaiming he’s to important. Talks about social injustice. You’ve really suffered from this unjust society. Laura 2 degrees. LeBron self-proclaimed prophet.
"I mean too much to society, I mean too much to the youth", seriously bro how arrogant are you? You don't mean anything to our society. And no, that is not racist. You're a basketball player and when you retire, there will be many more basketball players after you.

It's an amazing story how u got be where u r 2day. But w/ so many people looking up 2 u, to keep falsely claiming the president is racist or doesn't care about Americans is irresponsible. Ur brainwashing others w/ ur hatred. U wanted Hillary,a criminal married 2 a sexual harasser
Trump is a sexual harasser!!!!
@JJRedick is white pig
to quote @IJasonAlexander but i’ve got hand!
#NanceWasRobbed.
Damn cool.
What does this have to do with the economy, tax cuts, whites losing their jobs to immigrants, world affairs, border security, ISIS, uranium one scandal, Obama FISA warrant scandal, and so on, @KingJames ?  You are now a political expert so basketball shouldnt matter, right?
@JordanASparks20
@UCLAAthletics god bless LJ n I love u deep in my heart
Sheeeeeeeeesh!
Salute to the King
Dribble the throw the ball and throw it at them

@kevinlove that @UCLAAthletics jacket is hot. Is it available for purchase by the public?
Le Bron James please do not listen to that rude woman who told you to shut up and dribble. You are a good son, a good husband and an inspiration to young people. You have selflessly helped others and everyone knows this.
Lmao
Eric, sorry I forgot about you I keep  men like you are extinct. You are so proud of your conservative last white man standing who can’t stand smart women attitude, I know thankfully your type are fast becoming dinosaurs.
Lmao you’re living in a fantasy world. You feel sorry for me. That’s hilarious
