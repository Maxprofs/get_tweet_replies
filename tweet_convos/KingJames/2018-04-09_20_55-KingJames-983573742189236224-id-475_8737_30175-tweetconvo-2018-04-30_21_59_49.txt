Hey bron sabon
IDOL
This guy is good...  Wow

coooool
How do you even stay in the air for that long oml
Are you really that slow
Ti lox
Super power @NBA
Didn’t watch the play live or anything but what the hell is beasley doing 
Touché
So amazing! @KingJames
Follow the best @ZachRapMaster98

Thats mah father
wow another misguided stat there was 2 divisions with 7-8 teams in the 80's/90's it wasn't until 2004-05 season where 3 divsions per conf were created and 5 teams per division so its much easier to win divisions now consistently then before. This is amazing feat by lbj still tho.
wow
What a shot.  The best of the best.  Great game.
That was awesome.Nice move king James
@unclejeffgreen your face!
wawoooooooo
The goat
You can't watch this enough .  
The reality is if you put teams back in 2 division per conference how they were before LBJ has never won more than 2-3 divisions in a row so putting him in same company of those others is foolish.
LEBRON JAMES IS HANDS DOWN THE MVP NOW !!!
"The Scribe; Shutup and dribble" on YouTube

Spongin it

Thank you for bringing back 'spectacular' to watching the Cavs. The King rules! We don't care what happens next--you've given us some of the greatest moments in Cavs history!  #RestUpLebron
Lance Stephenson Should be sent back to kindergarten school to learn about the sportsmanship.
He is worse than the 3 year cry kid.
He lies in every single steps he takes in nba playoffs.

There is only one king of basketball and his name is Jordan number 23
Amazing vav. Lord of king 
The Illuminati wants to sacrifice LeBron James in Lamborghini. 
T.G.O.T.H.W is out in full force on LeBron James.
They want to cause him an accident while he's driving  Lamborghini and offer him as another celebrity sacrifice.
The king James
U gotta stop playing around with these clowns Bron. You all we got, bring another one home for us.

Beasley said

皮皮詹
Love you forever Lebron.
Is going to be better than Jordan
Nah fam the OneForAll is better!
All hail the king
Q isso em Len bron
The only reason people even criticize Lebrons greatness is because his personality allows people too. I was born in 84 Michael was the goat but come. What he has done for the game. #OhioMakesTheBestPeople

Basket god himself
Greatness at its best.......

Is anyone noticing this 
james james james
Jordan is the greatest of all time and it isn’t close.
That's a matter of opinion
No it’s a fact. Check my boys resume.
Michael Beasley. Nope.Jpg
.@KingJames carried his team all season w/multiple guys injured, including the PG & Coach absent, multiple trades, etc, and still LBJ lead them to win their Division & win 50 games. This sounds like the definition of a #MVP Season! 
#StriveForGreatness  CC: @cavs
Holy shit, what a statement!
Love it !
Michael Beasley got outta there real quick
LLTK  MVP! = LBJ!
King James

"250 pound Lebron frieght train. He's in the wait room, he's on the treadmill, copyrighted prophesy, 33 yrs. In the whole deal, from Hollywood all the way to Springhill"....(Lebron Song) 
Song of the summer!
Beasley would have gotten less flames had he just stayed in the picture and gotten dunked on.
In your face suck on it
Damn
LBJ!!
@leggs888 @MotivatingWOME1
Damn he straight dunked on that guy, he straight disappeared!!!
