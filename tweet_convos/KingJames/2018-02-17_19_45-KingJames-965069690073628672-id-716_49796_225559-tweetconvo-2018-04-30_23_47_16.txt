We would first have to investigate and make sure that it is not a Russian back to activist movement in order to create more divide among us

Yes

LeBron.....keep speaking up and out....your voice matters
I admire your tenacity kudos for speaking up I am paralyzed but I use my voice is it outspoken activist and there is no shame in my game #StayWoke

MJ stole that move
Thanks to Trump he is not in a foreign prison.
I watched that 1st dunk contest as a recent college grad and was awed by Larry Nance. Great job by his son in carrying on the tradition.

N I C E   LARRY NANCE MY FAVORITE SUN 
When will be your time to win one?
#LeBronJames      

Nance wasn’t anything special.
Don't hide behind your fans. Go and debate Laura @IngrahamAngle.  Get out of your comfort zone and let's see if you can engage in a mature conversation.
Sweet

All he does is bitch , you would think a guy with all that money would be a happy guy ! Jordan 6-0 in championships 
That’s what these liberals due , divide and do nothing for the people .
So when this was all happening under obama where was he ?
gone head and compete next year so bron jr can do it too
Dude, that's freaking cool
Yea was pretty dope watching him wear his fathers old suns jersey and everything
Yeah, that was awesome. I watched with my boys. They were all jumping around because they love D Book
Yea he was shooting lights out the final round. Was pretty cool to see him catch fire even tho I’m a lakers fan. Just enjoy great shooting as a fan
Oh, definitely man
You mean too much to society?? Huh? You bounce a ball how arrogant are you? No we don't need you're views on POLITICS get over yourself!!
Right on @kingJames for standing up for what you believe, even when sick @IngrahamAngle fox new anchors make stupid and racist comments. Maybe if she stayed in the kitchen baking biscuts the world would be better.
damn thought that said drunk 
Hey King.  #ShutUpAndDribble
Look out bron trust u and ya son will get y'all moment cause greatness is saturated in the air 
Now that’s picture perfect
@DomTheBombLive are you streaming tonight?

King James. Never stop being you.
Magnificent!!!!!
Yeah that is pretty sick
Just think, in a few years that's going to be you and your 1st born!

The more I look back at the #NBAAllStar2018 Slam Dunk the more I think Nance jr was robbed but I'm biased #LakeShow
