I just won an Oscar. WTF?!?
Nobody gives a crap about any east coast new york tony award...Los Angeles is the Entertainment Capital  of the World.
Kobe Bryant won an Academy Award...Los Angeles still adding to Kobe's resume.
Superstardom is all about being on the West Coast
CONGRATS AS WELL!!
Keep it up,LJ Stay blessed and safe.Amen
Can we discuss.the feelings you get expressing yourself so? Do you feel you're imparting all the wisdom of the.universe at all times nonstop
Feel like sooooo many people missed this. I was very offended as a black male watching a movie about black males being tricked by a white female into being tortured and enslaved, glorifying something we should be ashamed of. #REMEMBERthisACTUALLYhappened  #GETOUT
You welcome
You win a Oscar for carrying garbage for this entire season.
Rare W
more w's than you
#Oscars total;
Kobe 1
LeBron 0
Kobe>LeBron

Lebron real talk what you put in  your beard
Awesome congrats 
#NeverBetterThanKobe
I think it's time to watch get out...maybe after this most recent binge.  Who can say how's xxx or are you even? #1985tor #quintsquints #the
"This tweet was a shot at Isaiah Thomas" -- Skip Bayless
Lmao. That movie was the absolute dumbest nonsense I've ever seen. This is the liberal agenda patting a black guy on the back for making a racially fueled movie. The movie itself was so unbelievably embarrassingly bad Somehow it's praised like it's Godfather.
@KingJames im hungry af I have a sad ass story of hardship like the rest of the world but that isn’t wat it’s about it’s about work and love so I love my work and I will ask u everyday until I get a reply or a email to show I deserve to b placed in this upcoming #houseparty
Hi lebron , sent coach a tweet about ‘us’ going over pick n rolls not to double team but to stay w our individual man on defense. I hope you guys consider.


Lol
I'm your big fan and I'm human like Neymar. Send me your jersey
Hollywood sucks
Hey Lebron! Very pathetic that a tough guy like you is scared of Laura Ingraham. Although she's tall (6 ft 3 in.) she's only 120 lbs soaking wet! Someone take the pacifier out of Lebron's mouth, I think the baby boy is trying to say something!
Keep showin love cuz THEM ppl hate it

Thanks so much
That's a well deserved win.
Hi @KingJames you are the best NBA player for me and for a lot of people. I'm from Dom Rep and I'll be in Miami for vacation in your game with the heat. I would like to say you hello and a picture with you.
@KingJames
"Get Out" was filmed in Mobile , Al . It's awesome to visit a movie in the making. Congrats Jordan  Peele.
I’m sure the lady in Denver was happy to see Kobe win. You know, with Hollywood’s moral hypocrisy #metoo
Lebron to the oscars confirmed?
I’m surprised you weren’t cheering for Black Panther! 
LeBron finna win an oscar for Space Jam 2
See you soon Idol!
Best bit of the night! GET OUT instead of being played off stage. Great film.

Wow

Hey QUEEN James--We do not care about you or the oscars.
“Get Out” the Lebron James 2018 Cleveland Cavs experience

love you
Ssshhheeeshhhh
@KingJames da goat.

Way to make it about you
Anyone know why Oscar has a sword?
the worst movie EVER
Get Out was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Predictable plot, horrible writing, miserable acting except for the main character. One of my top 10 worst movies.
I've been a fan since you started in the NBA.This is my first time to send massage to you,so ,I am looking forward your reply.
Somewhere, Kobe clears his throat. "Eh-hem"
Yeah, I liked it too.
Cuz he's an immigrant
Sheesh #respect  #GetOutMovie
So if you come to the @Lakers, you can do films and movies right after your retirement, and you can sell more @BlazePizza than any other places! See ya my @KingJames
Beast
Yea im like WTF 2 it was a weird ass movie bout inslaven blk men to whites by f up their minds
King of basketball
Great job Jordan !!
be free, be strong, be mighty @KingJames. You know who you/we really are!
You didn’t like any other movies? How come you’re not congratulating all these other well-deserving winners? What’s the deal Bron?
The Black Panther movie------is totally WHITE OWNED

Blacks are the faces out front

But these whites own it http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/8217351/1/ …
One thing nobody can ever accuse you of is being in the sunken place
Keanu?
You bout to “Get Out” of Cleveland.
Get Out was trash.
@santiariasl15 @ManueDiazJ
Ty gonna make you play the 3, 4 & 5 for 48mn tomorrow , better to bed @KingJames
Lebron needs a coach like Pop. Had enough of Tye lue
Congrats 
"Get Out" describes your situation in Cleveland right now, team is trash af.
lebron with this weak ass compliment 
KingJames I had to confiscate a pair. Stupid sick bruh bruh!


Yes it was definitely a creative movie. Great idea..i loved it too.
Yep
Why you type “Get Out” like you ain’t never watch the movie but you’re getting paid to say something good?
Bron I just defended you when people said you don’t have an Oscar and Kobe does... because you never had a rape scandal. Who am i !?
real

Listen and Repost my song " Dark Skies" #np on #SoundCloud  https://soundcloud.com/oey242/dark-skies-prod-by-wakeupwes …

#Huncho
4 reeeels bron-bron
Lebron just dribble you will never be on the Oscars


One of the most satisfying movies in a long long time. 
Get in losers, we’re going to the Finals
For our 6th finals loss*
He made a 73 win team add the 2nd best player in the league just to beat him. Sad
Promise you and Jordan will collaborate so you can get an Oscar to match Kobe’s?
Congrats!!! Loved “Get Out”!! Keep it going  TYPE BEAT
I AINT GONE LIE DIS DAT 
@JordanPeele kingJames

LeBron doesn’t need an Oscar when he has this
Good one



Hi GOAT daddy

“If LeBron jumped into the film industry he’d win as many oscars as he wanted”
