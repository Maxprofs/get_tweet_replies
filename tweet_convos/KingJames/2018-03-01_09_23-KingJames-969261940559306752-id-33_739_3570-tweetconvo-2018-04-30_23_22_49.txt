LeBron is about to pass Dirk while hes still playing lol
All good. Pretty spectacular for a kid from Germany. Lebron was expected to be this good for a long time.
LeBron was not expected to live up to the hype the way he has...stop it smh
You're right. Nickname The King since high school. Don't forget it was him and Carmelo as the future and Carmelo was irrelevant 3 years in because he was so good.
So what!? Lol...nickname is nothing but that a nickname you still have to prove yourself and I love Dirk not hatin just sayin
Dirk Nowitzki became only the 6th player in NBA history to reach 31K points. Kobe Bryant is the youngest ever to do that (34 yrs, 185 days). #NBA
LeBron will take that honour too. #wreckingmambalegacy

Women he raped? Probably.
