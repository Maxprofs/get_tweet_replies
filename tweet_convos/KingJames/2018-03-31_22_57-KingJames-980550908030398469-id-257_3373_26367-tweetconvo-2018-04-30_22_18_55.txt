I can drink to that- cheers bro  @TheRealSeely
Cheers
A moment I’ll remember the rest of my life! @THETNKIDS
@stoolpresidente typical lebron.  Making the moment about him self.
Explain exactly how he's making about himself???
Had tickets to March show @MSG..had surgery just prior so thankfully it was rescheduled..turns out recovering and have two tickets to your October 22nd show with nobody to go with. Guests welcome :) @jtimberlake @Ellentvcom
So, because he's LeBron James, he can jump on stage without warning but if I did it, I'd get thrown offstage right? If he got thrown offstage as he should have, there'd be a lawsuit
Good luck throwing 6' 9" 255lb LeBron off stage. Lmao dont be salty, its life man. If you're a nobody you get treated like a nobody.
Excellent response, you're absolutely right

Your the man Justin! 
A very powerfull moment.
@jtimberlake
Great show!  Love you both.

Nice
Are you wearing two different shoes
#Equality

He is right, Colleen?!
Yes, they are designed that way. The LeBron Equality edition. One black, one white.
They’re awesome. I wanna pair!
So where all gonna ignore that @jtimberlake has on two different color shoes?
2 Kings. 1 City.
Nice @KingJames and @jtimberlake — two of my favs in one of my favorite cities— way to rep!
Love these guy's
It was a great night! Thanks for making my birthday special!!


King James Rep our CitY

Trs cool
Hey Justin was wondering if you could help me with a discount ticket. As more people want to see you, then there are tickets. Just sayin’       I know. #areyououtofyourmind
He’s giving tickets away. Find the contest
Best. Concert. Eva!!!!! I’m still on a high from your music! You never fail to entertain!!! I was slightly excited when I realized how close our seats were to the stage...
Wow I really wished I could hold your hands while I was performing .

Did anyone notice J.T. has a third arm growing out of his hip in this picture?
Can’t wait to see you in Tampa!! Would love to score meet and greet #MOTWTOUR #051518
Did he do a shot of @Sprite ?  You know, basically poison he pedals to kids and gets paid millions.  Hey kids, drink carbonated corn water.  Dude is a joke.
Soooo your security detail missed a stage invader?  Fire them immediately JT. Could be much worse next time. Kevin Hart.
KingJames with my favorite..JT
Wow, can't choose a better surprise guest!

@jtimberlake If @garthbrooks jumps on stage in #Tulsa, it will be 1000% more worth my 14 HOURS on a bus in my #wheelchair from #SoDak that I am undertaking 2 see u & @THETNKIDS @BOKCenter....LOL  #JustSayin 
Really King James. 
Dear Justin, a culture vulture like you isn't worthy of this
Sure!! When I did it I got tazed and carried away. 
@serenatara_
Mi sento male due idoli in una foto sola
Did he complain of being fouled on the way to the stage?
Kings! 
Happy Easter from JTS!
LBJ with another career assist to JT.
القارة الأوروبية بنيت وعمرت ونهضت علي حساب القارة الإفريقية. الذين استعمروها استباحة ارضها ونهبوا اموالها  وقتلوا شعبها.نحن نفتخر باننا اغنا قارات العالم وحوالي59% من موارد العالم في افريقيا.
He's a jerk.
@KingJames
Justin.  You’re wearing two different shoes.

This is so embarrassing.
Equality shoes. They come in both colors.
Great show!  Thanks for being an amazing entertainer!

Shouldve been an afternoon tip-off that @KingJames stopped at @Maaco to fet his head spray painted again. #Cavs #MarchMadness
Your dick is bigger than a baby's arm!
Legends only
@littleadri

Yesssssss
My favorite dancer from the 2020 tour!
@KenWatlingtonNC look what ya missed!
@tommyjohnmurray
To bad you didn’t go to that one
So sad a good friend had to leave beacuse a family member passed away just before Justin preformed.   She was looking forward to this for months.  Looked like a great night.
Justin legal
Gottyyyy
Wow that's amazing and awesome
@916_will_I_am damn it
Oh shit
BEST concert ever!  Danced our asses off!!
Fucking awesome!!! Thank you!!
Dope show 
@NickFromJersey
Hope the king jumps on stage for your October show too!  I will be at that one!  Love JT, and LOVE my king james and the cavs!
8 days till I see you in MONTREAL. I can not even begin to explain how HAPPY I am,Have a great day!
Of course he did. How dare you take his spotlight.
My 12 yr old step daughters 1st concert!!! Awesome work last night JT!!
Yes you did! You two talked about it at the game that’s why you covered your mouths.
@sleepy_hazzerd  did you see this?
And I missed it! 
Oh, but I try to jump on stage and get beat by security. Lol
Justin cantas bellísimo,  eres un gran actor y también muy guapo!!! 
This doesn’t do you justice Justin.  You should have had Chris Stapleton come on stage.  Such a great voice.
So embarrassing for you that he saw you with your un-matching pair of shoes! #GotDressedInTheDarkInTheWoods
Cool
check out my song J Tizi ...
late.  a trippy song to help stop crying about an ex-lover who found you important a little too ... #late. #Emo #ITakeMyPillsBecause iHurt #PTiziLivingDlife whole song download: http://www.SoundCloud.com/p-tizi-musick/late … -…
You were in his arena. Of course he’s getting on stage:-)
Some security detail you got there aka useless
Wish I could have made it to the show last night, unfortunately I'm hooked up to oxygen and couldn't take it with me. @KingJames and @jtimberlake I wish I could have been there for the show. I heard it was a good one!
Was that a real shot of alcohol?
Cheers guyscosmic ching chings & Easter love ...how can you be so sexy J huh?! Daaamnnn! #Onfirehothothot!!
Good Job

Was a great way to lead into Drink You Away, show was awesome!
Lebron is the JT of basketball!...and Jordan was the MJ of course #JAM
