Give the man his 5th MVP 
It doesn't matter if they black or white....;)!!!! My size....is....lol:)one day!!!!

Cool, Justin Timberlake is wearing the “Lebron 15 Equality “ .  @jtimberlake @KingJames  @equalitynow  @nikebasketball
.@jtimberlake makes his living from the culture & acts like he's "down." However, like many, when push comes to shove, i.e. Nipplegate, he had no problem leaving @JanetJackson hanging. He only reps for the culture when it benefits him & will abandon it quicklywhen it doesn't.
I can’t believe the mvp got to meet lebron
Looking fab,
Hahahahahahahahaha that’s fu*****AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Happy Easter Sunday to guys

Watch @Giannis_An34 play ball. He gets hammered every time down the lane. Good for him not to have your antics. #6

@zboyovskish & I may have been creeping on you in Cleveland  – at Quicken Loans Arena
Loved seeing @jtimberlake sporting @KingJames awesome shoe at his amazing concert at The Q!!
Booo. No king James
That was a great show last night , the grass was lit, you definitely took it up a few levels, hall of fame show!
Up
Timberlake dresses like a blind homeless person walked through goodwill and just put on the first thing he touched .
That mismatch was cool when Lebron did it, Elvis Timberlake just makes it corny
Who’s vapeing  by the mirror ? Jr smith ?
They didn’t drop the JTH though. I spent 2 hours looking for the Nike truck or a pop up.
Aye
hello
LJ is a dick.
Love it
No
LeBron is
#1 I wish Christine would stop criticising LeBron. She doesn't know anything! & She's always complimenting herself! She just knows how to get along with Colin CowHerd.  Who I'm paying!! You're welcome, ingrates!!
Yea
vstrands
Both are having hairline issues with their old age
@jtimberlake
Get your "THE CHILDREN OF THE DREAM" poster - 

http://etsy.com/shop/WaysideUS 
‘Equality’ sneakers made in the most unequal of conditions.
Saw your CLE show and noticed the sneakers. Wonderful show.
I like ur swagger
What are those.....
Is he wearing Bron 15s or Grinch Stole Christmas 15s?

Should have had those equality shoes. It's getting ridiculous to try to get common hands on these shoes. Yet our kids are expecting those miracles. Thanks yo!
Lamar Jackson to browns ..... make it happen @KingJames @Lj_era8
Hhhhhm Hhhhmmm. ....

@ComplexSneakers @jtimberlake @KingJames
Those sneakers Justin is wearing are the worst looking sneakers I have NEVER seen ! 
@KingJames @jtimberlake y’all not playing fair. But the feet’s are 
 ill do most anything to get these to give to a less than fortunate kid down at MLK PARK I see all the time. He says he has to leave home until dark every day :(
If they have equipment support I may cross train with my Adidas
If the shoe fits wear it!
Amazing.
I was at the @jtimberlake concert last night & it was amazing!!! It was really cool seeing LeBron @KingJames on stage! Thank you for the fantastic show.
