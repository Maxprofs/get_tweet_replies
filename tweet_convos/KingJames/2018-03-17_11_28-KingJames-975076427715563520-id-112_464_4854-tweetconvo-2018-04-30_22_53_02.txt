LeBron u should go to the blazers with Lillard if he don’t want to go to Cleveland because u want to play with him right so that would be a smart move.
Kingjames

Hey Man I'm a huge fan, but I gotta tell u,and unfortunately I've been saying this for months,and ur going to hear this in June or maybe before,but I'm sure it will be said ." For the first time in 8 years an NBA Finals without a LeBron James led team." Sorry
Yes unfortunately I feel the same way I think it’s over 7 years was good while it lasted 

Hail KingJames
Follow me
Go irish!!!
I think you meant .. Go Celtics!

Arlington Christian Academy days 
Did you use ped?

Thread of Lebron “Yelling at his teammates/Coaches” : 
I mean obviously you’re talking about the #Celtics right?
 James to the Celtics confirmed
If you come to philly you will accomplish what you didn't in Miami... win not one, not two,  not three,  not four....... Simmons,  Embiid, James,  Saric, Reddick.... that's almost not fair!
Win tonight.
Playoffs ....1 and done

We love the reassured confidence King. Continue to #StriveForGreatness #LLTK
Thought you might have been referring to the real Irish champs.... 6 nation champions 
And I’m in it
hey Bron, just fyi if you come to LA you’re not allowed to use that emoji anymore 
We love u lbj

WHO IS THIS DUDE? HE GOT HELLA BARS  
A NEW HEAD COACH WILL BE ON HIS WAY FIZDALE TIME.
Because of legacy he stay in Cleveland. The right pieces will be added. Hood, Nance, Clarkson and Hill all a part. You will see Korver, JR and TT gone. Leonard comes or Kemba. Will happen. Big through draft Ayton or Bagley. But will need a big C vet. Gasol will be added.
 #GoIrish
Daddy please rest today against the Bulls
Hoban beat then tho jk I love u bron be my dad
Lebron likes this guy
If he stays in Cleveland you can almost rest assured Kawai Leonard will be on his way to Cleveland. Since San Antonio as being reported problems with them. Fizdale will be new coach. JR and TT gone. A major big from draft Ayton or Bagley. Gasol. If not LeBron goes to Spurs.


If you would have gone to college where would you have gone?
You’re my favorite person. Ever.
@DruOnDemand 
But bro.........nevermind
Who will LeBron sign with this offseason?
There’s no Pittsburgh option.
All we know is that ur scared to 1v1 me
