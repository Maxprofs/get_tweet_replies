Come play with Kyrie again in Boston. You both should talk out your differences and make it work. If you came to Boston we would take down Rockets and GSW. You, Kyrie, Hayward, Horford, Brown starting 5. Brad plays positionless basketball. That starting line up we would go 82-0
Went to this game, can't believe Wilson is a freshman,  kids going places

The best player on your team demanded a trade, your hand pick coach is done with you, and your "best friend" played better once he left your squad. Nobody wants to play with you. #TaintedLegacy
