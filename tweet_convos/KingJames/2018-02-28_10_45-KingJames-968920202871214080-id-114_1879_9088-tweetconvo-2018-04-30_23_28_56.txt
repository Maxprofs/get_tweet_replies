Salute to @kingjames for blazing another trail & becoming the sole member of the 30K/8K/8K club! Follow his journey to the top in LONG LIVE THE KING  at https://youtu.be/EfCOPLDA2wI . #LLTK #StriveForGreatness  
I came from China at the age of 16, and I like you for 5 years since you like to play basketball after you like to get your reply.

This dude comments on all of Lebrons post! Ignore him and he will eventually stop.
He doesn’t just comment on his he comments on so many others he is fucking annoying
I know... he comments on trumps page too. It’s just a act to get followers. It’s hella annoying
Hes such an attention seeker

The goat
Sacrifice! A testimony to who and what you represent! Mr James
And Gold is obviously for Kings.  Just saying 

damn Lebron u are super humble. too bad Jordan is twice the player you will ever be
STOP SMELLING YOUR OWN FARTS LEBRON
KING  really? you must be self appointed go play with your basit ball bitch
I admire you like a basketball player but i love you like a human being

congratulations!
While becoming the first player in NBA history to tally more than 30,000 points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists--King James, also, averaged a Triple-Double for #BlackHistoryMonth 
#LLTK
30k points 8k assist and 8k rebounds no problem. I predict 40k 10k and 10k. A milestone that only the king will pass.
加油老詹！ get another chamption！ King forever swag
@nillucs14

#CompleteTheProcess
Hey Bron don’t big yourself up or ever acknowledge your accomplishments like most people do. @KristineLeahy has an issue with it. She’s ok with anyone else doing it but you
salute
Separate from his incredible career, we love the fact LeBron has in the past several years become more active and vocal politically through socially conscious statements and assertions. Keep on changing the game!
Appreciate how you always respect and acknowledge you had a whole community behind you
Appreciate u bruh
