#MVPizza!
Lebron you’re a great player and great guy but a bit of advice.. please think before you speak!! Every time you open your mouth about politics and the think with nick Sabian = it shows how ignorant you are smh. Makes it hard for your fans to defend you
You know, if you add just one more letter to Blaze you get "Blazer". Interesting.
The real question is do y’all have vegan pizza? 
Yes! We offer @daiyafoods vegan cheese, plus all of our crusts and red sauces are vegan! For more information on our menu and ingredients, please visit our website, here >> http://blazepizza.com/menu 
We LOVE us some Blaze pizza pies!


@KingJames
this is the best!!

Tell @pizzahut to just fall back as well my dawg invented pizza too!
You didn’t invent people talking in a barbershop. Humble yourself
Best pizza? @BlazePizza got a 0.1 rating from @stoolpresidente on the Barstool pizza reviews... over 350 places and Blaze was the worst!

I guess you never had NY pizza
Blaze is garbage and so are you
@stoolpresidente 0.1
you can't protect your TV Show Idea Lebron! you Can't Protect a non fiction TV Show Idea-ie-house reality shows.  Just because you think you did the first barbershop talk show, you can't even copyright it, only trademark.    you are not the first bro!
BRAND NEW VIDEO!!! PLEASE SHARE!
Surprised you havent tried suing them afterall, there's a bunch of talk goin on at pizza parlors. Lol. Ive never seen such a stupid lawsuit. #ThatsWhyYouShouldHaveWentToCollege
Let's get some here in The Land! Damn!!
Blaze is definitely available in the Cleveland area.
Just went to blaze for the first time this Friday down in Columbus, it was really good
Nice! What kind of pizza did you make?
Just a simple double cheese
Nothing wrong with keepin' it cheesy! We hope to see you again soon!

Great pizza but bad leadership -@kingjames how do I get the manager of the Newark restaurant to respond me to after a colleague and I were threatened with assault??? It's been over two weeks and crickets.
We're sorry to hear that. Please DM us so we may discuss further.
Will do, but I've emailed multiple times and the response is they will be in touch "soon"
LeBron James. @tianna_mudd @TiannaLMudd1 @tiannamuddfans @jameernelson @RealJamesWoods @James_Cassells @TheSpencerSmith @jharrison9292 @KingJames

Keep Alabama outcho mouth
Please cease and desist making pizza. You are infringing on my intellectual property of combining dough sauce and cheese. #LeBitch #Garrett
@JeradLehman
Make it Annually @blazepizza the office   of Huncho Day
Hi comrade
LeBron your douche level is at an all-time high, so if someone talks about sports in a barber shop it’s a copyright infringement? Man you are a pretentious jackass
LeBron is a walking endorsement lol
Let’s not over sell it
i love you just love you
NOCE GOURMET PIZZERIA
Blaze pizza has the best New York style flop. Or is it the Cleveland flop . Who knows    Either way the flops are great .

Y’all obviously never ate real pizza if you think blaze pizza is best in the world
Sir, what about Pizza Oven?!?!
Hello Mr. James.  Respectfully you really need to try “@TonysPizza” on the @OCNJDaily boardwalk.  Blazes all others!!
Love my #pietops #phallamerican #pizzahut
Which pizza is the King’s fav??
If only blaze pizza actually paid the workers the right wedges and there overtime pay 
I love you LeBron!！！！！！
Bring @BlazePizza to San Antonio
NYC has the best Pizza G

Great Mamba Mentality performance today, dad. 5-21 FG. I made this to pay homage to you and the Black Mamba. #KillerInstinct
Skip Bayless is going to be like going to say one of two things: "5/21 more like 3-5" or "LeShannon doesen't understand, Lebrick went 5-21, MJ would've gone 6-21!"
