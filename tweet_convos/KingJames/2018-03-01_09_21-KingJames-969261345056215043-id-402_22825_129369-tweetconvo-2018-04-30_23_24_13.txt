When Curry shoots, there's a kid in the crowd holding the pose. Crazy.  






You posted the wrong one
youre 1-2 against him in the finals
2015 no kyrie and love, last year added Kd was too much for anyone to beat
Excuses excuses weak af

Why you always jocking Steph? Because you know you'll never bear him or win another title unless you join him? That's weak af. He don't never say nuttin to I but I constantly got his name in your mouth! #NotLikeJordan

My Son Austin Perine poured his heart out to Birmingham, Al. Please watch, retweet and share. It's pretty cool. 
The two of you are great players and better human beings. Sad to read the majority of comments here with so much hate.
Real t
Let me get this picture signed since me and my friends are in it!
U are the goat lebron and u r still. So humble
Curry golden state
Cool
LeBron to Golden State confirmed

Lebron to the warriors confirmed
It’s a shoota thang 
I’m laughing to my myself hard asf cause I feel like you missed , leaving your teammates salty asf
You tough tony ona net
LeBron ur softer than Charmin!! How about you stop tweeting at this man and start beating this man!!!!
If y'all didn't know, these guys actually are friends off the court. This isn't 2k 
Nah we are well aware. The love fest with your biggest competitor is just corny ...
It’s called respect homie
Good luck at DBU #Respect
What does that even mean 
@mcbeasta mood booster
Supadope!
Never seen someone ride cock like you
Athletic Scholarships are Contracts for 12Fball & 29Bball games? Players must legally decline to participate in any addl game in 2019 until they get a professional Rep to renegotiate Players' compensation for those Addl Games? Make the schools take action to save their cash cow$$
@KingJames im hungry af I have a sad ass story of hardship like the rest of the world but that isn’t wat it’s about it’s about work and love so I love my work and I will ask u everyday until I get a reply or a email to show I deserve to b placed in this upcoming #houseparty
@_elatt LeBron dey give in 
Watch  Listen  Like  Retweet 
Yo Johnny this kid probably shoots the rock  better then you hahahah

Clever cropping there! LOL

Good that we just dont compare 6 years
Lol then dont highlight a triple double month for lebron since we dont compare a certain time in a player career
Lol .. apples and oranges .. they saying that no one done that .. not saying that because no one done that he is better than everybody .. which he is but that is not being used as argument .. and stop letting your insecurities trouble you so much .. why so insecured
Lebrons not the only player to average a triple double for a month, if that’s what you’re saying here.
Only player to avg it post age 32 ... And thats many many minutes on those legs i tell you ..b
Oh yeah, no doubt he’s over worked. Personally I think he’s the goat, but that’s just my opinion.
I too think so .. but i wouldnt be mad at ppl considering mj as goat .. better scorer no doubt ..

I mix my dreams with my reality. 

I’m “In My Lil Gap”

Look at your baby Lebron admiring the best @IAmKingJC

MJ would never do this buddy buddy shit with a rival. #Weak #mambamentality #StriveForGreatness #StopKony
@BaBy_GaToR1
Friendly ass 
Need to be worrying about getting that ice

Do it for the kids y’all 
Same Kid Or What?
Bruh why is cedi osman and tt starting man!! They are not giving u anything, put green and nance in the starting line up please bruh and fire coach lue and bring in mark Jackson.
And a baseball cap  w his silhouette on it (make sure I get my cut).

P.s. LBJ, u are the 2nd King. Selma, the city made famous by the 1st King (MLK) needs leadership. Concordia, the only HBCU founded by woman is about to close. I am a former professor. Let’s discuss.
Sheeeesh
FAKE.
That's super dope!! TYPE SHIRT
 New Merch Alert 

Affordable and multiple Colorways.…
Haha
LeBron your team losing was super dope and then your teammate acting like a five-year-old at the end of the game was super STUPID!!!!! YOU better talk to him.  Next time he might get dealt with........ on the court
@CashNastyGaming Your favorite player favorite player is the player you hate 
Aren’t u guys supposed to hate each other?

I really like how you guys support each other even though you’re on different teams. Now, can y’all reach out to the students at Stoneman Douglas High School who’s fighting trump, the NRA & the republicans on gun control laws? They need y’all. Thanks

Real recognizing real right here
Shut up and dribble
Tough 

SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Along with you, he just needs toshut up and dribble.
And there’s the difference again between Jordan and Lebron. Jordan would treat his rivals with utter disdain. Lebron too busy trying to be the most loved / socially active...
Who day kid in your profile pic 
SHEEEESHHH!
Fuck @StephenCurry30 and his 3pt shooting
Why is this dope

Bron 2 the warriors
Whos going to win
Kids dig the long ball too LMAO
@jacksonkevinp
Steph bein steph
@codsow
Hello Mr. James.  There are a lot of kids in Philly who’d like to strike the same pose with you.
Don’t tell me this same little homie 
Stephs not a good guy
Cool
@dangelo_joey7
Sheesh!
that’s what they do when you winnin’ 
@esadsalihovic7 dude ur supposed to be rivals
This is exactly what it’s ALL ABOUT!!!
I have 5th & 6th grade boys in basketball, all the boys do anything Steph Curry does!
Besides one of the best players ever, great role model too
You guys are the best and such an inspirational people for everyone throughout the world! @KingJames @StephenCurry30 if y'all become future team mates, y'all will be unstoppable!
The guy in the photo @KingJames is @Pows14 he loves golden state and his fav player is @StephenCurry30 #baller.
Get down here to philly and cement that legacy #brontophilly
shut up Lebron. lol
That is epic

For sure!!
@JoeMcAuley00

Hope you have this one framed.
And get the kid some free shoes or something...
https://www.gofundme.com/2tqqwquc 
That is dope. #kidistraining
Only when curry shoots? 
That kids arm is super long
Fuck me dad
This is the best #NBA tweet today on http://sportofusa.com 
Ayo D’eatin like shit 
#respecting #greatness @KingJames & @StephenCurry30
Hey I have an idea, quit using the word "dope" as a term meaning something good. It sends a bad mixed message to kids.
Fam that's KD's son with the long ass arms
@gs_youngest  i feel like h giving hints
Curry: naw i don’t want to. Cute kid though! 

LeBron:
More fuel for the drama fire.  So, so annoying.
Cleveland fans should copy lebron as well When he does his secret move ???the stadium would have a great attempt at the wave  we can call it the flopped wave attempt .
Why?? he ignores the kids...
This man gotta take the  out of his mouth...
Bravo
SHEEESH CUZ THATS SO WET
Question is: does this kid get paid? #MiniMe
That’s just awesome!
@budmashi @zayrahmed @sach_21 @nostrarosh @agrawalk1991
@KingJames  why are you suckin your rivals? First KD now Steph? Im confused
He’s gonna be doing that to you in the finals and it’s gonna be all net. But here you are welcoming a 6th finals loss

Goose neck!!
Notice me senpaii
why Lebron? He doesn’t care about his fans
Same kid?
These tweets right here is what makes me worried. You need to find a way to beat these guys and not get swept in the finals
@Cgriffin3323 he’s goin to the warriors with the amount of @ ing them lately
Showing kids it's okay to pose after a shot.....SMH!! Be humble! #dontshoboat
No hate in His blood 
Respect
And people say LeBron hates curry smhhhhhhh
Its not just jumpshots. Every time you two speak your mind, stand up to injustice, do something generous or take a great risk, there's a kid in the background, imagining themselves doing it too.
wow that was a gay fucking comment to make. stop virtue signaling
He don’t give a fuck about those kids
MJ still the Goat
LEBRON STOP BEING FRIENDLY. JEEZ 
@CashNastyGaming warriors
Sheesh
Only When Playoffs Start. Where Real SuperStars Are Made? James Harden Game 6?. Travel King 
Why does LBJ got to kiss GS ass enough
He still a bitch though huh master LeBron James
Low key teaching kids to hold their follow through
When u chasedown block someone and I’m at the game I slam my hand into my nachos but u never want that pic framed
Yet again, another reason you should not, “Shut up and dribble.”  You two mean so much to many, especially our future generation! 
Lebron to golden state confirmed
Why he sucking up to the warriors tho look at his last tweet
Bron to golden state confirmed
Lebron to the gsw confirmed
Imma be honest with you Bron, I love you you the KANG but I would HATE being your teammate. Fact especially if I consider myself a premier player in the association

enemy
#phillywantslebron
LeBron going to the Warriors confirmed
Join Warriors please!
Para de dar moral pros alemao
Why are you BFF with everybody? With more of a killer instinct you would probably have more rings especially that Dallas Series you were too athletic just needed the killer blood in your vanes and you would if got another chip
Bron stop playing nice. It’s almost playoffs
why you fuckin with golden state so heavy didn’t you just lose to them in 5 and will probably see them again in the finals? man where the competitive loyalty at.
AMAZING!
When you can’t get that shot hold on to get a pose for a photo #StephenCurry30 #StephCurrySavage #LeBronG.O.A.T
I wonder if there's ever a kid posing like he just threw his mouthpiece?
