King,SHIT...MJ is the best of all times!!!
Why hate on King James? Is it because he actually help people to live a better life? MJ never did that. That's why James is called King. Now you know.
You are a good guy @KingJames

You need to go back to school for your grammar. Please re-read your tweet and make the appropriate corrections. -Teacher
Seems like you understood what I said so take your corrections and stick it up your ass Teacher stay focused the topic is L James who is uneducated went from high school to pro and somehow because someone has money makes them great or a role model is a joke
And no. Having $$$ doesn't make him a role model but donating $41 million to send kids to college does. Trump on the other hand is seeking to cut $42 million from DC that sends inner city kids to college every year. But the "uneducated" guy shouldn't voice his opinion about that?
And if you do not like the president that’s fine but let’s have some class everyone loves to play the blame game but do not have any answers for what they are complaining about
Awesome
@IngrahamAngle what have you done to help anyone EVER? Your days are filled with spreading lies and being complicit. Stay in your lane and let The King be King.

Great job housing is needed. To whom much is given much is required. Jobs education tech.
