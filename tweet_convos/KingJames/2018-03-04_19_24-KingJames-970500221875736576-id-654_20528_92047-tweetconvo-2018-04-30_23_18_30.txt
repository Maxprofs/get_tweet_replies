"KD gonna have more by the end of his career."
“ I don’t need an Oscar I’ll get this ring anyway”
"FACTSSS."
No soup for you

Kobe Oscars: 1
LeBum Oscars: 0





W
Kobe fans right now
Why’s the quality on this one so good? 


Just another thing Kobe is better than you at
You're corny & this is coming from a Lakers fan
Kobe Bryant has as many Oscars as Leo DiCaprio
Who would have thought
Two 
Lebron better cutie

keep grinding LeBron maybe one day
Maybe one day you will find a talent instead of mocking 12 year olds for money
"find a talent" such an awkward response

Kd’s wayy better than lebum
Oops wrong account
And he didnt even need Shaq and Pau to win it 
I mean, Kyrie and Kevin Love probably helped.
Can't compare
How is it not? Without that Kyrie three, Cavs probably lose game 7.

Same could be said for Lebron's second ring. Without that Allen three, Spurs almost surely win.
Almost can be said for almost every final ever played.
Yeah, which is why it's unfair to say that Kobe needed Shaq and Pau to win his rings when LeBron needed a bunch of help to win his too.
Yea but LeBron has always been the best player on his winning teams in the finals. Can’t say the same for Kobe.
I tried to make him understand that but he can't.
Lebron would need Leo, Denzel and Hanks to win an Oscar.
And Spielberg to direct
And Weinstein to recruit.
Like for kobe Rt for Lebron. Who’s better
Lebron

MJ gambled, didn't pay his debts, and cheated on his wife. LeBron married his high school sweetheart, is a public figure against racism, is building a highschool, and is giving $41 million to allow kids from Akron in bad…
LeBron>Kobe
#TryToHaveLongerHashtagsYouCant
KoRapist got his first win without a HOF big man.
At this point, why argue who’s better, let’s just be happy we were able to see two of the best players in the game 
awesome!  #WeAreMoreThanShutUPDribble #Oscars90
We need more black athletes like @KingJames who aren't afraid to stand up and use their platform and voice to point out social injustice within the black community.
#WeAreMoreThanShutUpDribble
Long ass hastags...  You still the GOAT though.

“If LeBron jumped into the film industry he’d win as many oscars as he wanted” 
GOATs



I love how you show love & support to others accomplishments. I know it’s coming from a genuine place. It’s sad people try to put you against people. For God Sakes!
It's not directed to Lebron.....it's towards his fans---unintelligent, immature and disrespectful fans towards Kobe...so we fire back---at will...
Anyone else find the irony of the Oscars being all about the women's movement and #metoo yetttttttttt praising Kobe?!? No? Just me?!?
They're all #HYPOCRITES!
Learn how use to, two, and too...stay off the king
Didn’t use 1 form of those words in my tweet, tweet at me again, and I’ll bust that massive fuckin beak you bitch
I can’t wait for you to break my beak but please do it before it’s too late. I’ll tweet this two times.
I see what you did there.

(I guess only for Franco, Seacrest and Harvey)
You should debate @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews I think it’d be interesting to see.  If not debate, make an appearance.  After the season tho...
LeBron is too chicken to do that! If he goes on though, @IngrahamAngle should invite Jason Whitlock, who rightly told LeBron what time it is! #LeBronsAfraidOfLaura #ShutUpAndDribble
Congratulations on the #Oscars2018. 
@KingJames you are always present, dutifully on point with your brothers, teammates, colleagues and young men, large and small, for #history.
@kobebryant #Congratulations
You’ll never win an Oscar lebron
Boy if you don’t calm down 
#KobeGotChargedWithRape
it's great to see kobe win. in an industry where the expectation is to just "do your job" and nothing else, it's important to note that they are just people to, and many have other interests outside of the sports they excel in. big ups. excited to see how the future unfolds #nba
If you're more than just a dribble, then give up all your money and settle for 35k per year and then try to have the same public voice that you do. If you truly we're, more people would listen to your ideas, and not just follow you because of the dribble.
Did you read your tweet before sending it? I don’t even know you and I think you have more sense than that. Do we ask actors to give up their fortunes? The president is a billionaire. Why would you listen to someone making 35k differently? Don’t drink and tweet!
That's literally the only way I can think of that makes tweeting fun. Don't take away my fun, I'm not hurting anyone.
you have 0 oscars
Kobe>Lebron
Lebron also raped 0 women so 
Lebron > Kobe
what's the conversion rate on rapes to oscars
I'll get back to you on that when I pass my conversion final

You support trump tho...
Mmmmmhm. Just as guilty as Kobe
In your dreams
Black Excellence
Absolutely #KingJames that's all
Even though I don't like LeBron James as a basketball player and I'm a Kobe Bryant fan, at the end of the day, his man is human and I respect him as a man. Let's keep basketball talk on the court people!
Cool to see the brotherhood between kobe and bron
Listen to Money Carlos_Dope Boy_Prod. By Cheese.mp3 by Ndakold Moneycarlos #np on #SoundCloud
U never won an Oscar???? Is Kobe better than Lebron???
#heylebronyourlonghashtagsarehardtoread
Tell em Bron!
Sending shots shots shots nigga

Like if lebron is better
Two s 
LeBron to Lakers confirmed

@kobebryant has always been one smart dude, that doesn’t mean all nba players are.  How many different languages does Kobe speak? He’s a league unto himself.  #congratskobe
LeBron barely speaks English!
When the officers asked Bryant whether she said no or resisted, Bryant replied, “Okay. I’m thinking, I’m thinking, I’m thinking. (Pause.)   I don't salute rapists and neither should you. Do better @KingJames
When asked by police how she knew Kobe Bryant had heard her, she replied, “Because every time I said no he tightened his hold around me.”
Shafted man you should have won an award for this last year #Oscar
yes ok but he’s a rapist
#WeAreMoreThanShutUpDribble Lol... You are so butthurt
If he was butthurt he would have said nothing dumb shit
You’re better then Kobe
congrats
What Lebron really wanted to say 

Ahahahah savagery
No you're not you're just a basketball player. I know because your physical abilities you believe your God like but you're not. #ShutUpAndDribble
Yes wingshack sports bar and grill  little rock  ar
Hey wasn’t this year the @Oscars_2018live we’re going to be more diverse? That looks like a whole bunch of white women to me  #MeToo
@matt_bedard
Lol 
Whey to go Kobe Bryant’s when they go high you go higher ! We can do anything 
#thatswritten  (e40 voice) 
KD to Kobe will you do another one ??

@RealSkipBayless Ernestine's thoughts?
You aren't in his league
Yeah, way to go- “According to the police report, while he was being questioned by the officers about the alleged sexual assault, Bryant said, “I should have done what Shaq does,” “Shaq gives them money or buys them cars”-“Kobe stated that Shaq does this to keep the girls quiet.”

Mamba walked that moment down Oscar lane and ripped that dunk, off the dribble, classic instant legend
Please go anywhere but the sixers Please

Yo King u APPLAUD THIS >Bryant admitted 2 an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser but denied the assault allegation The case was dropped after Bryant's accuser refused 2 testify in the case /separate civil suit was filed vs Bryant by the woman It was settled out of court
But Kobe don’t dribble anymore

Kobe is more than dribbling as are you but
#yep.
#didKobegettomeetThekat
That was on stage. Cute.
YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO SAY,nephew lollet's never mention that woman's, name !!free PUB b damned
You are not so #ShutUpAndDribble if you never had basketball you would be nothing you entertain. #nomorewatching
We are more than shut up and dribble. Is it just me or does that not make grammatical sense
Yea just awesome giving an Oscar to a rapiat. Nice work so much for the #mwtooiguess
LBJ..... your not on the ground floor anymore.  You can't hear our voices from the penthouse. #realmidclasstalk
#NeverBetterThanKobe #TakinShotsAtLebron
Just dribble and shut up
Sorry for all of the jokes I made last night
Well, except for the rape.
lets go
Those hashtags tho 
#MostWordsEverInAHashtagIWonderIfYouEvenKnowWhatTheyreFor?
Loved Loved Loved the acceptance speech! #DontEverShutUpAndDribble  As much as I love @NBA it worried me when Kobe went straight into pro  w/o his chance for college education. Same for @KingJames later. Seeing you guys excel in life as well as on court is fantastic!
Congratulations Kobe Bryant Great Job
Your the most arrogant and conceded person in the world.  #imTakingMyTalentsToSouthbeach.  #whoCaresWhereUtakeYourTalents.  #jordanwillalwaysbebetter
So everybody forgot what he did in Denver right?
Nope.  What about the girl in Colorado?
Respect! Love this dude how he's happy for everyone's success!
@NoemieReynier
Still crying about that, 

always crying about something,

 doesn't know the meaning of struggle...
Wonder if shut up and dribble is what Kobe said to the poor girl in Colorado? #MeToo
Wonder if sitback and watch is the other thing he said to the poor girl in Colorado? #MeToo
#GOAT
Oh no your not!
Hashtag game tho @Lxthal_ 
#UJustContinueToSitBackAndWatch
nice
Cool
The "me too movement" just gave kobe an oscar. Bravo!!!!!
Shut up and lose more finals!!! Then make up a fake vandalism story!!!
Please go #ZeroDark23 forever. Thanks
You should talk to Kobe about how great of a basketball school his high school Lower Merion is. I think your son will fit in well there.
Long ass hash tag Lmaoooo
Lol dead 
#MambaMentality
Shut up and dribble Lebron, you know nothing about how the world works.
Shut up and just dribble. No one cares what you have to say.
The irony that he won during the #metoo movement isn't lost on anyone.
Hi.LeBron.I dreamt of you last night, and you shook hands with me, but I wanted to hug you. I can't express it in English. I do a hug with my hand, and you hug me. It's so exciting. And then I told you I liked you for 6 years and made 6 gestures. But the reality has been 8 years
LeBron x Kobe 2020
Don’t @ me
Yeah, rapists.

King James I loved your Commentary on becoming great.   It was amazing,  I watched it 3 times.  You should win an award.
Last time I checked there is no "we" with Kobe's short. So you had no part in it. #ShutUpAndDribble
Congratulations.
King

Yes we are KingJames. And I was so very proud of Kobie for winning an Oscar as a writer!!!! Haven’t seen the movie but I definitely will take our grandchildren to see it.  “white privilege” allows news reporters to say whatever they want and become very disrespectful.
I have my degree, but I have found out over the years that their are many educated fools being hired to the highest level of incompetence. Our WH Administration is a prime example. Great you are supporting Kobie, so am I. So I say,”Speak your mind” then dribble the ball & win!
SHUT UP AND DRIBBLE!!!!!!

Keep it tight#keepittight
If your going to give you have got to learn how to take it.
You need to try harder to unite the Citizens and not just Democrats, ,,you have a great following and purpose beyond your beliefs.Your a very smart man ..please unite us with your wisdom..Thanks*************
Muito bem
During the #metoo movement they award a former accused raper an Oscar? Oh the irony of the dumbocrats 
Yea he is more than just dribble he's also a rapest!!!! YAY GO Kobe you're the man because you won alot as an adult playing a kids game weeeeeeeeeee
Congratulations Love! The whole ordeal 15 years ago was about money, because of women like her it makes it hard to see the truth on women who have actually been sexually assaulted.
不确认你是否懂中文 也许你也该学习学习了 支持你 支持科比
kobe is a very insightful and wise man. he displayed thst side oh him during his last couple years in the nba. now he just took it to another level. so authentic.
dalao
Is he more than the rape charge he paid to go away.

Amen
@KingJames you are the greatest player to ever.... lost the game. Lol.
In your haste to support Kobe; you forgot to be sympathetic to the victims of the #metoo movement. I know you didn't go to college, but you can read... right!
Awesome LBJ
I'm so proud of both you Beautful Brothers...haters gon hate...but nothing can stop what God has destined for your life an legacy. This grandma loves you 2 pieces!!!
Somebody please explain hashtags to LeBron...
The hashtags are classic
G
Kobe is at least. Rapist.. -Colorado NBA fan
Still waiting on kobe to accept @IngrahamAngle. Kobe, your not intimidated of a little blonde educated woman are you ?
Professional players like Kobe can do FAR more than just shut up and dribble and rape.
Two cry babies that cant win with role players. Gotta have All stars to win and cry when they dont have them. Holler back when you have  Like Mike
Didn't kobe rape someone?
Your an overpaid athlete.
http://2FB.me/https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/970500221875736576 …
Shut up and play basketball. We don’t need your politics in the sport or otherwise. Got sick of the Wall the way they have to use 4 balls to take away the money they earned. Not interested anymore
Come on. Still with the shut up and dribble? 

Your kind of guy Laybron.
Go away and stop trying to take the spotlight #affected
No not really
Props on the award. Question tho why you always gotta throw personal agenda Into shit?

Did he thank the concierge in his speech?
Best #NBA tweet today on http://sportofusa.com 
Yeah he raped a chick I think
Who is the Best Basketball Player of All-time? Michael Jordan or Lebron James? Best answer given at the end of the submission stands a chance to win a 250 dollar gift card http://bit.ly/2oV2LVE
