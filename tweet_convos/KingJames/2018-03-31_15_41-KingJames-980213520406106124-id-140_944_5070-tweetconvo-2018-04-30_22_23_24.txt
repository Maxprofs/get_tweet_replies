Wow! Sir James! You are a stunning example for our children. My deepest thanks!
Love you and im sooo proud of you..you are a awesome guy and thank you for all that you do to keep the youth//ppl postive and focused..@teamlebron
Go, LeBron.
Thrilled to partner with you on this one, @KingJames.
This documentary features one of our Founding members @dorothytillman, please tune in.
I coached youth 18 yrs. Many 2 or more teams, per year. Great track record, many kids changed direction.

I discovered that most dealt with split families. Plenty Dad hit them & had addictions-anger.

Not saying Afric American own it 100%. Stepping stones.

#CivilRights like this @KingJames
I challenge the more than Athletes crew of @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @KDTrey5 to live off $1.25 a day like these did for a month
Civil rights like @KingJames exploitation of yellow slaves making $1 a day making his @Nike shoes . I guess your fight for CR are only for the people we see not the ones you exploit
Jesus believed in people being brother and sisters 2000 years before MLK, jr. We all are Jesus said. We all came from God & are God's children. Jesus needs & gets the credit for wanting to bring together humanity by world scholars.

Rise Up! That's what's up! The Movement! From http://O.G.Ro $$!
I'd love a sequel on how the crack epidemic was used(planned) to rip apart the black community from within after the civil rights movement, ripping generations of black men from the home.  As well as the welfare trap encouraging broken families.
Shut up and dribble
# push truth # great job " G" ........
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @CBSSports
Gotta love & #appreciate #LeBron for the person he is on & off the court.
Lebron to the falcons? #RiseUp
A true role model on and off the court. Thank you for continuing the work to lift up our communities and bring people from all walks together through your messages. #GOAT 
@IngrahamAngle, you should shut up and watch this. Since a kid got you fired you have plenty of time on your hands.
Scrolling some of these tweets lends a perfect example of why this documentary is needed and a must-see!
#whenyouknowbetteryoudobetter 
Go Bron. Let the haters hate. They just want to keep sections of US populous down. Be it over -exuberant police , voting  boundaries, bias media , or the tiki brigade. For ppl with ur influence it's a responsibility to b a voice 4 #equality #striveforgreatness
Growing up in Akron, I recall National Guard tanks patrolling Wooster Ave., and curfews during the 60's. Scary to see at grammar school age! Moving to Chicago in the late 70's & seeing people like Dorothy 'The Hat' Tillman & Harold Washington affect change was also eye opening!
Why are You Still on  Facebook?? #Riseup
Will Ferrell Says He’s Joining the #DeleteFacebook Movement http://bit.ly/2upMFJG 
It’s great to do charity. But stop announcing it to the world. Ye who work in iniquity. Do it out of love. Not for publicity.
Shut up lol
Thanks but no

Thanks for being socially responsible..Stay Blessed
Great show!!! Thanks for the info.

Jesus rose up after his struggles, but you didn't mention him today!
Yo do you want me to create a YouTube video on this, Interesting project

Hey !REBLON
牛逼啊 老铁

Mr King James im your big fan
Did you know the @AMarch4OurLives was never a by kids for kids about kids movement? Bloomberg owns @Everytown that created March4.  His publicly declared agenda is to disarm minorities from defending themselves. He especially hates black men. @davidhogg111 LIED he founded march.
@davidhogg111 is now trying to drag you into his self promotion. Please refuse to extend both of these malicious intentioned people personal gains.
Amazing how your work outside your regular job will help our society. thank you.
What a great project! This story about the struggles of blacks during the Civil Rights movement is amazing! Great job @KingJames
Hope this film gives interviews to progressive like Bernie sanders who actually supported MLK

@TinyToyBit


No Ben Carson or Candice Owens? Hmmm... seems less like an actual movement and more like political pandering. Honest and open conversation is left by the wayside for pleasing our own echo chambers
Nice swan
