Need help lebron. I never been to a pro sports game ever. In south carolina we dont any pro sports teams so, if you can help me i would be so greatfull.
So just because you donâ€™t have any pro sports teams you need help? With what? Save some money up, take a little road trip with a friend and go see a game
