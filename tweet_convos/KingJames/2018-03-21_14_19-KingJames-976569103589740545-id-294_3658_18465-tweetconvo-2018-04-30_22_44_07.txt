Get pumped for tonight's @Cavs @ESPN action with @KingJames' best no-look dishes! 

: #AllForOne x #WeTheNorth…
Greatest player to ever play the game. Micheal Jordan couldn’t have made half of these passes  If he ever would’ve tried to pass
#facts
The légende king James
I taught you well Grasshopper
Good player
@declangray15

Bump a no look pass. Do a no arm pass and then you’ll be better than Jordan. 
lolololololol
五黄牛逼，大王牛逼

I know you're watching this and missing my boy @DwyaneWade, half of the assists on this video are to him 
I come from China and I have been on Twitter for the first time. I like you for 10 years. I want to tell you that greatness is beyond doubt! !

Te amo posta
@JosiahOklu7
King,  冠军！
@KingJames you need to sign with @Raptors next year! We would win at least 70 games and you will be a hero not just in U.S but Canada! At least consider
@Connerdagen dude he’s so in his bag right here
Haters will say it’s fake
Congratulations cavs on last nite..Fight Cleveland#Homeland2#Quiet Strom8

It will be absurd if they will not give you the MVP this season... Glad that i’ve seen you this year 
17 assists??? Throwin dimes!!!!   Reminding me of my days growing up in L.A. watching Magic (Showtime) with the great "Chic Hearn" on the call..  Nice job my brutha.
@7madalru مايستحي
Cool
敢问有段友？
@NBA @cavs @espn LLTK ... There's nothing else to prove ... Waiting for the final ... Cavs vs GSW
Honestly @HoustonRockets VS @celtics or @Raptors
... You wrong if You are thinking That Rockets will beat GSW...
So lovely
@FlorianRay @buym0re @PradhiAnton @R_Cochet
Even the coach fell for your no look . You truely inspire we young ones aspiring to be in the NBA to become kings too

@KingJames you the best player on the court 
哇奥
boss man
6666
Not a mothertrukin turnover
Bang!
Swag

This was great. I was practicing it all last week

I miss wade/Lebron duo that was badass
Mama there goes that man!!
خلاص يا الغالي
LbJ is 
Passing is just 1 of the reasons why Kobe and Jordan aren’t comparable to the King. Only Magic, Bird, Kidd, and Penny were blessed with this kind of court awareness 
Wassup big bro
That shit was wack tho .
Keep speaking up for what's right. People hear you.
How did Perrants London earn a locker next to the King (23) need practice and confidence #GolandaChampingship
The best player in current NBA history
It’s like Jason Williams and @MagicJohnson had a love child!
Great job. You can do it, again, this year 
The GOAT
Then he dropped 17 dimes tonight 
I need to start hyping myself up like LeBron does for himself.
Goo Warriors

King , please shave the face hair ! @foxandfriends @foxandfriends
All the haters are missing out on history! Something world seems to want to forget! NO JORDAN NO CHAMBERLAIN NO RUSSEL talk.... this is history...’s are missing out on history! Stop trying to justify the conversation and show some appreciation! @espn
jordan was so much better
Dazzling Dishes

MJ or @KingJames?

@dennisrodman shared one thing LeBron has over MJ. #NBA 
L
Gonna need a bunch of these in the second half after that performance in the 1st 
Why u are not playing defense anymore??
Good. But please play some defense
Bring that defense up don’t get blown out
Magic!
I don’t tweet out everything good i do at work everyday. #humbleyourself#sheesh@PFTCommenter @BarstoolBigCat @Bevansen

You Already Know The KING, #TheLand
Worldb.free22 at http://soundcloud.com  follow me check me out

 essa enquete não foi do Datafolha 
Here comes the LeBron Haters smh...
FYI - not only did you not “end” Nurkic’s career with that dunk, but @bosnianbeast27 has been dominating even more: 21 pts, 11 rebs, 4 blocks, 3 assists, 2 steals against the Rockets last night! 
#RipCity
