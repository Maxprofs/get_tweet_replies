He's off of life support!! Thank God!! 
My husband spent 48 days on complete life support, 2 yrs ago. He had influenza a, group a strep, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing pneumonia
Mrsa, 3 cardiac arrests, he was down for 20 mins as I stood by and held his hand. I never once believed he would die! I came in there every
Day w/God's love & power to heal. I 5 went in the same day, only 2 lived, one was my husband. God is Good! He works miracles! 
My husband has some slight brain damage, he spent time in a rehab home 2learn to walk & talk again. They said, 30 days min! He was out in 14
Thank god he’s better now
My goodness yes! It was terrifying 4 me, we have a 20 yr old autistic son at home! If he would've died,our world was going 2 crash around us
We love your intrinsic ability to uplift and reward everyone who's apart of your journey! Keep it up, we can't wait to be business partners with you!
