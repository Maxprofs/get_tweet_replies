Damon Jones got his soul ripped out that night
Man what kind of shoes does D Jones have on??
Maaaaan somebody in the thread said bus driver 1s 
Lmao sick.

So when are you going to fire your assistant head coach lue? #Buster
Must of realized MJ is your daddy and started praising him
“Fuck out my way”
Softy
@Lebronjames can't stack up to MJ
MJ had it easy, you would cry also if you carried a shitty team on your back for idk how long and finally win. Shit I’d cry to.
in reference to your bragging about your strong dunk (2 points of 105 team scored) have yiu ever seen Jordan's dunk highlight reel?? Also I never heard MJ brag about a dunk after his team lost by 8 points MJ ONLY cared and bragged about winning and going 6 and 0 in NBA finals!!
is ……wooooo

Bring the mask back
I LOVE THE KENDRICK LINE @KingJames #Nostalgia
I’m sure the real question everyone here is dying to know is “What the fuck are those” 
King those new guys from LA play good 3 or 4 games, then shit, no gasolina, no balls, fuck them, go back to miami and get kevin durant kyle irvin paul george and you, it got to be great team enough to win 2, 3 rings, do it, talk them, talk pat Riley
He knew he fucked up when he decided to ball in S.Carters 
we don’t know what he was thinking either my g
As a Bulls fan, the image of you jumping OVER John Lucas is burned into my mind 
Dear Lebron, I'm a big fan of yours in China. I've loved your tough style since 2008. I hope you can visit China this year
He hooping in s carters? Lol
LMFAOOOOOO stop judging
Man I just never seen it done  makes the picture even more priceless
FRAUD
