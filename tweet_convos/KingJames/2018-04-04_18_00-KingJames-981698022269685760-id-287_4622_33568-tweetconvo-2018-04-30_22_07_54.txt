It was a shoutout to my man Lonzo ball for breaking the record set by Nick Van Exel as the only rookie to ever miss eleven 3’s in a game..
Nick the quick sounds like a purse snatcher's knickname.
You are a genius. I watch basketball just because of you. GOAT! No doubts and no comparison with anyone ever! Go get the Fourth one for extended family (fans all over the world)! #greatest ever
“Nick at Night!”
King James, I’m one of your biggest fans, but please Shave that Shit off The Top Of Your Head! it looks terrible! why haven’t your wife told you that yet.. how could you have a show called the shop and go on the court with your head Looking like that?
@kylekuzma let me know if you need an authentic van exel
The majority of L.A. fans do NOT want Queen James to ever put on a Lakers uniform. This is Kobe land, the Real King. You know, the one with 5 rings. You know, the one you never faced in the finals. We despise LeBitch James. We certainly don't want you nor do we need you. #Lakers
Don't come to L.A. We don't want you here, ever.
Love
Craziest free throw shooter ever
Dear LeBron: I remember Nick the Quick. I remember the Big O here in Indy. My friends family went to school with him at Crispus Attucks HS. My friend is your second cousin, she has Parkinson's. May you or your Foundation send her a note GOAT? They would never ask so I ask. TY!
BRON WHY U DON'T TAKE OVER LIKE U DID LAST NIGHT EVERY NIGHT???
He puts up a 27 point trip dub every night
Man I miss Tha Quick

@SLAMonline @kylekuzma hi

I think some of you need to get your brains Wright LeBron would never be a Laker man keep wishing la stay strong
Why would he want to leave a legacy behind Kobe Bryant when he's a better player his self all hail King James
And I'm from the westside of Chicago born in 77 so I watch Mike's whole career grew up on Michael Jordan lover for sure LeBron is the king of kings so if anyone knows I do all hell to goat King James keep doing you bro

Have you seen #barstoolsports new "original" show The Shoppe.  It's amazing.  Finally someone has come up with a good idea.
@MoEgger1530 
Don’t tease us
Stay away from my team stat padder
How are you padding stats shooting 55%? And leading the league in clutch time (last 5 minutes of a 5 point game) production?
If he really wanted to pad his stats, he'd have about 50 more triple doubles, or he would be averaging 34 ppg on 43% shooting. I can't count all the times he's missed a triple double by one assist or one rebound
Come to LA bro
When I say L.A. You know the real team of L.A.


LeBron to the Lakers confirmed you heard it here folks
