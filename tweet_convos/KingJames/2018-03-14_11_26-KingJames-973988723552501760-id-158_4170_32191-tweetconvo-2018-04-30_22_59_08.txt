I don't think this city will ever be ready, for the day you retire. It'll be a lot of  going on!   #AllForOne
Till he leaves and you guys start burning his jerseys again..
@joethomas73 absorbing @KingJames’s hug was like blocking rushing defensive lineman. Look at him brace for it.
LBJ, in my opinion, you are the most hard working NBA player in the league then and today. Wether you make it or not to the playoffs. You are still the best. You just need more help, that's all. I think all the NBA legends can attest to that. #GoLBJ #GoCavs.

Whether or not it's talked about on the major networks, income and wealth inequality is one of the defining issues of our time. Please join me, @SenWarren, @MMFlint, @DarrickHamilton and others on Facebook Monday,…
Kobe and Jordan would never
I like it ni****ga
Losing legend on the line ,, we suck again .,, go muddogs
Custard coat  time.
At least Joe didn’t bail on #Cleveland when they couldn’t win a championship.  Hell, he didn’t even bail when the #Browns could barely win a game.  Thanks for showing the  respect though LeDiva.
@Lebronjames what a joke...what you did to lue at game.MJ will always be better than you.And i hated MJ.Good luck softy. #Leflop

Ahhhhh you got to much pride. Do what you can to fix this. Do whatever you got to do. The best thing, the right thing. Work together. Lead them too victory.

Attention:
Say it ain’t so Joe, JOB well done 
Too bad the @Browns never had a QB worth protecting. But hats off for staying loyal.

亲爱的勒布朗，我终于注册了推特，能直接向你表达。很激动，16年克利夫兰拿到冠军时，我泪水不自觉的往外淌，控制不了自己，那是感动，激动，爱，欣慰，各种感情参杂。不知道你能不能看到这段话，但我必须表达，不论你接下来经历怎样的风雨，请记住，在中国，还有很大一批人，站在你的背后支持着你！

Lebron I'm your biggest fan I read almost every book about u
It is always great when someone gets the revelation that their season has changed in their life.  Many miss it and stay in an old season of life too long!  Congrats Joe Thomas! Move Beyond the Athlete!

LEEEBRO JAYM ! U ugly fam. 
Awesome tribute, King!  Joe was very loyal to Cleveland.
Any chance of you suiting up for @cavs ? I know you could get some boards and you’re good for 6 fouls.
Meanwhile in Atlanta....
@KingJames Hi there, you don't know me, but... I think it would be amazing if you could reach out to this kid, @JustinlBlackman. He took a stand today... and he stood out there all by himself. He's an inspiration!

@JustinlBlackman was the ONLY person to walkout at his school in North Carolina. Let's show him some !…
Through the ups and downs, through all the crappy qb play, thomas never left Cleveland like you did

Good thing he didn't leave the city to win a title. You gotta respect him for that!
Would’ve respected him even if he did. He deserves a title!

He should be enshrined this year he was that good!
Game recognizing game, defined.  Well said and ditto.
Thanks for all you’ve done for Cleveland.  Best offensive lineman ever and such a great advocate for the community....also funny as hell.
I just realized Joe Thomas played 11 years and only missing a few games... however he only won 6 games in those 11 years. Omg.
60*
Joe Thomas and LeBron James! Cleveland is blessed to have these heros! @joethomas73 @Browns_Daily
Indeed great career. Hope you join the coaching staff when they do start winning which will be soon. Best luck to you both and God bless always.

He doesn’t need to hear from bandwagon fans Captain Flops A lot
Much respect for #73. Good Luck in the future!!
You'd be one helluva NBA commissioner once you retire. I'm sure from a financial standpoint you wouldn't need to, but your ability to be open-minded and your understanding of the game is unrivaled.
Atleast he didn’t leave Cleveland like lebum did...
Hey James watz up playa,look I have to talk to tiger woods bout something that might just kickstart his game again... I coulda been there w him giving him the competition he needed 4realz: I ain’t lying.. I tell u more about it l8tr... if u come across this tweet plze follow me

Look @ u paying attention to football. Interested eh?
He could probably be All-Pro for a couple more years, and a starter for five more - but the standards that he's set for himself won't allow for any "diminished" performance.  
Mad Respect for that!

GOAT
He’d average 20 points 20 rebounds in MJs era
He'd average 3-5 finals
MJ averaged 1-9 in playoffs without a hof teammate
Should've had an hour long prime time special where he announced his decision to team up with Hakeem and Malone in Houston.

The LeBron James way.
