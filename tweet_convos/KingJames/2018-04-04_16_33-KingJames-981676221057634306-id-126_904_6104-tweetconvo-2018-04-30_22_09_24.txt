It's amazing to see the joy she gets from watching the team play. I just wanted you to know that Wanda is pulling for you in the NBA and in life! She admires the family man with humble beginnings. Thank you for making her happy. 1 game at a time. Good luck in the playoffs
DDF you can do slam
True American hero #LeBronForPresident
You're so hot daddy

Just saying, my mother who is nearing 70 is Labron fan no matter what. As a Ohioan she is proud of the Man you appear 2 be on screen, &wth the love you've shown Akron. She watches most games from her little apartment, loving the Cavs adopting you as her Man(wearing #23 jersey)
KING OF KINGS LEBRON

你是永远联盟第一人
More than line ups, DEFENSE wins games
Hey @KingJames, will you please tell your side to stop telling Kanye to shut up and rap.

Best of Luck!!  And take care of yourself, have been watching you since you were a young lad & admire all you have done in return for the gift God has given you.
Where's your support tweet for @KyrieIrving ??
So if someone makes a documentary about civil rights going forward, are you gonna sue them? Cause I mean you obviously came up with the concept of making a documentary about civil rights. All you. #TheLawyersWillFigureItOut

King go ahead an step on they necks them boyz aint ready bro#EasternConferrncePlayoffs

Lebron, stop whining like a little baby about Coach Saban and his barber shop video. Hate to tell you, but you dont own the rights to a barber shop video. HIS IS BETTER ANYWAY !

Sheeeeesh
Hey LeBron, have you seen the new Barstool Sports show "The Shoppe"? They stole your intellectual property of guys talking in barbershops! Everyone knows you were the guy who invented that, along with low carb beer and the alley-oop pass. Better sue them, too!
Your barbershop lawsuit it such bullshit, but also a very LeBron thing to do.
You do know blacks commit more crimes against whites than the reverse even though blacks are a minority. How’s that for racial equality?
Bron the warriors are hurt. The east is yours to win.SEIZE THE MOMENT NOW

Welcome to the 2nd edition of Black Card #Revoked heated edition, answer at your own risk. 

Who has the worst fan base?

Yea boy, can’t wait to catch this. Thank you!
Lebron if saban was black would you have made the issue you’re making now? #lebronjamesisracist

Will all those people working in sweat shops to make your shoes be included in this documentary???

Oscar nominated.
Very! I found a Penny heads up true story.
Someone else made a civil rights documentary before u. I hope they sue the shit out of you.
Let's go!

not really id rather watch waffle house cooks

Bullshit
he literally said it
We appreciative the strides you’re taking to make our country greater, king .
Congrats. Still find it amazing you call your company Spring Hill....  I helped to finance that property back in 2014 ish and it blows my mind the journey you made from that place in Akron to where you are now.


Congrats on the effort. I will tape so I can watch.  Giving back is important.

You have been a King of a Basketball player, become a heck of a man.

Now, PLEASE, no more #ChiefWahoo.
didn't the Cleveland Indians say they were removing the image, now the Washington Slurs need to change their name next
Still profiting of racist images. If something knowingly causes harm it should not be used for profit. Cheers 23.
they should change both  name and image, obviously
Absolutely. Native mascots promote white supremacy. Those sloped brow images are consistent with scientific racism. Redface an acceptable version of #Blackface. They perpetuate racism that can lead to tragedies like #MMIW. 

Watch video. http://cbcmusic.ca/posts/19787/classified-powerless-music-video-premiere … @classified
