Why do I have a hard time understanding this tweet even though it's in English?  Bad English (to sound cool) isn't a good example to the young people that look up to you.

Please explain to me why you like music that glorifies drugs, misogyny, materialism and racism. I genuinely would like to know.
Can’t even imagine what you could do for a living if you didn’t play basketball

Check me out @KingJames
