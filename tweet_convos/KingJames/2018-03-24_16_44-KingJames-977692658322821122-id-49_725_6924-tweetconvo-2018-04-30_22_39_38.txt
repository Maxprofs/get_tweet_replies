2018 STATE CHAMPS! BACK 2 BACK! We are now the most winningest boys basketball program in State history @OHSAASports. We now have 8 state titles! #1rish #bannerchansers 

That high school team would go 82-0 each year in the 90s NBA plumber era.
@AFCasszi
Hey Lebron if you play us in the playoffs The Pattison Ave Phanatics would love to have you on our show. @paf171613 @wildfire_radio
@STVMAthletics You had better focus on the Warriors because they are coming for you like Russell Westbrook coming.
This makes no sense. Focus on the warriors like Westbrook coming? Wtf. #dontsmokecrack
It makes a lot of sense if you knew anything about the game of basketball.
I know plenty. It's just a horrible statement. I get Russ attacks...but u bring up the warriors, why would u mention a dude who doesn't play for them? Kd attacks too. Draymond comes at you. Just a clown statement
You must be a white boy because all the brothers know exactly what I'm saying.
you about to get your 4th ring since curry went down again.
Would be great if you stayed with the cavs, and youre boys played basketball there
Criaram uma situação muito desfavorável, sem necessidade, como corrigir isso agora, assessoria, passa pra ele, são burros, não vai tirar um centavo do bolso, cê acredita, acho MVP nessa temporada, opinião, existem pessoas sem ética e está ao nosso redor, Abraço!
King and Prince @cediosman

This team would be a 7 seed in the Eastern Conference
I’m sure all those kids were born and raised in Akron, Ohio.
@KingJames if trotwood harvested the best players in the dayton area every year it wouldnt be close. #publicschools #homegrown

Congrats team & coach Dru from a fellow alumni in NYC!

Desculpas pela sinceridade, à NBA tá envolvido no prazo máximo, me prejudicar junto com ESPN, segue seu profissionalismo e carreira, estou muito cansado e desgastado, ninguém tem dó, mas os atletas não tem culpa! 
Qual à culpa minha?
How about Deer Park winning their first state title?
To God be the glory. For the things He has done!
congrats SVSM, but how about a shout out to the Trotwood Rams, LeBron. @twoodbasketball
