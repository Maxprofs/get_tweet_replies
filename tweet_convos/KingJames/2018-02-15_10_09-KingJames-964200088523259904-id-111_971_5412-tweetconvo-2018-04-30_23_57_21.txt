Go on @IngrahamAngle show. Let the country see that you are smarter than she is. You will crush her in a debate @KingJames
Lebron !  We will be forever for the joy you bring to Cleveland. BUT YOU ARE POLITICAL. YOU ARE TURNING OFF MORE THAN HALF YOUR FANS ! I suggest YOU PLAY and YOU DO NOT OFFEND. You will be a happier person and will be a better teammate.

hi @KingJames I would cry tears of happiness for days upon days and more importantly so would my man if you could help me figure out how to get him to one to one of your games.  we love you but we are broke
We keeping ? If so, why dont you talk about your illegitimate son who lives in Salt Lake City? Maybe why you have lost 8 straight in Salt Lake... if we are really keeping ? 

NBA prima donnas, followers of the liberal, Anti-Trump narrative.


It doesn't change to color of racism. Put the onus on the racist, not our skin color.
Schooled by @IngrahamAngle hah
Smh
That video is pure cancer. You should be ashamed of yourself for indoctrinating our youth with your divisive lies and rhetoric
Shut up and dribble.
Our government is broken. NRA, Big Pharma, Big Oil, and Big Coal own our politicians. Help us get money out of politics.

Anyway you can shed light on this would be great. No one represents the workers in this country.

Your me guy keep it real
Can’t wait to see you dodge Laura’s show #coward
Whatever you do LeBron.. Dont let these people control you! Continue to speak up about issues & dont let em silence you
Hello Lebron！I come from China， I've liked you for years ， Hopefully the injury stays away from NBA forever ， I will always support you!
Don't pay any mind to that ignorant Republican apologist @IngrahamAngle. She thinks just because you're an athlete or don't have a fancy college degree, it prohibits you from talking politics.
Bron, we have to say something about these schools shootings. America must ban together! @SiriusXMNBA
@KDTrey5 I'm a grown man and admired both of you on the court for so long. I admire you both more for what you do off the court. I just want to give the two of you a big hug and say " keep doing you" because we need your voices 
Let the kids play the ASG. stay home, rest. #winanotherchampionship
Coolin with the oops ion see him winning no more to friendly

Keep playing good  to win the championship

To hear you talk about trump as a bum tells me that you have not come to far in life you as a black man dont like to be judge and  Ridiculed for your color but you do the same things that you dont like to our President very sad to see.
