Hey Lerbron I am a big fan
Nice try LeBron...just cause you do your best to surround yourself with great people it doesn’t make you one. No matter how many concerts your crash (ruin) to satisfy your insecure ego. Plz don’t ruin another Timberlake concert.

Hey man. Just wanted to say thank you. For being a positive role model for our children today. It's more than lip service. Thank you. 
Hello sir LeBron, I bought a LeBron 14 Agimat special edition shoes for my son’s upcoming birthday and he’s one of your avid fan. He had a few collection of your shoes and one of his dreams is to have a signature with his shoes. I hope sir you can grant his dream.

I just watched "More than a Game" and it was beautiful (and made me cry tears of happiness).  I'm glad you were able to get a job after high school;)  Its good to see you encouraging the young ones coming up in the game and in life.  Thank you.
You are my legend forever James

You are very great...

Iam  praying for him!
We are love        In you we see LOVE    Keep on doing it

Another  young king ，hah～
@king James we need your team to come over to this baseball side. A lot of young black kids has no representation we can trust.
Saquon should be pumped to go to cleveland, and go 0-16 in 2019
How I hope the conversation went: “Get out while you still can! I wish I went to the knicks, New York is the place to be!”

He’s already failed by being “buddies” with LaTard.
Latard? Lmao sounds stupid af
Yo lebron you gonna sue him for having similar shoes or na?
Cool pic
Quit thinking U R a "King", and learn humility that U are no better than any man under God.  U will be judged as U live and as U claim to others.  There is redemption which will only be judged by God, not what U claim to other men.  You are burning collateral.

#nofloppinginthenfl
@Giants you know what to do
bless to your 9th final game！
WHAT ABOUT CEDI???
