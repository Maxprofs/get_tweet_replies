Sending checks to the big boys ey scotty??

As I was saying, @realDonaldTrump ... No real difference (other than speed) between killing people with dirty air/water & killing them with other toxins &, as you've intentionally installed Pruitt to dismantle the office set up to protect us, no difference in intent. Murderer.
Ah...another round of smoke & mirrors, You fools deny climate change and the potential havoc it will wreak & pretend you're supporting environmental enhancements.
Does that require first class flights? Soundproof phone booths?
We're going to need all the #CleanWaterHere2018 HELP we can get with all the dirty, mining and coal pollution! @WhiteHouse Good thing they don't make Mr. Pruitt's Clouseau cocktails @LeDiplomateDC with any water–oh wait, an ice ball IS water!!
.@EPAScottPruitt “My jaw dropped when he said that,” said the first administration official. The perception that Pruitt had gone on TV and lied, the official said, was what really scared people inside the agency. Stop raping America and RESIGN.
Fuel efficiency standards rollbacks is pro-pollution & anti-life. Air pollution stunts birthrates, life expectancy, vision & breathing of plants, animals, & human beings. @ClimateReality @SierraClub @GErenewables @Ford @GM @chevrolet @Boeing @Chrysler @harleydavidson @MSNBC @CNN
STOP WASTING OUR TAX PAYERS DOLLARS!
The Trump Administration is doing no such thing. What it is doing is allowing this crook to enrich himself by stealing from the American taxpayers.
He is abusing his position, wasting tax payers money, sweet deals w/lobbyists , destroying our environment.

#FirePruitt #CA48 #ClimateChange…
I think these people are brazen enough to do both.
Is that what you call it when you contaminate water with coal industry byproducts/poisons? Resign at once!
What about Flint, MI? @EPAScottPruit How about come to Flint and talk to the people behind your 20 man security team... because we all know thats the way you do things... #noballs
What a joke. Improve water infrastructure.  Pruitt is from Oklahoma a state that just put it's 54th lake on the list of those poisoned with mercury.  How about improving the water? Koch brothers lacky. Wasting tax payers money and lying just like Trump!
What are doing for Flint? Spending taxpayer money on extra security first? Fraud alert

i live in Flint. i haven't washed my hair in my home in 4 years. when I brush my teeth, i use filtered water. i shower and my skin has strange reactions. my accumulated water bill is almost at $1500 at this point. i'm not paying.

*bog
Just heard you want to change EPA logo and you’ve ordered leather bound note books. Let’s see how else can I frivolously spend the taxpayers money?
@scottpruitt is the most corrupt of the vortices of the @realDonaldTrump administration

#ForgetRosesIWant
  Someone heading the EPA  who isn’t increasing cancer rates by allowing increased corporate poisoning of America’s air and water.

Scott Pruitt let drillers get away with destroying thousands of Oklahoma properties... a state that went from 0 earthquakes to 700+ a year.

Pruitt cares only about his own power and will step on anyone, from students to seniors, to get more power.

And yet we had ANOTHER earthquake just YESTERDAY IN western #OKLAHOMA....and the #OilandGasIndustry balks at, and refuses to PAY for, damages to #OKLAHOMAcitizens homes!!!

So you paid Samantha 159k for what now? Under the clean water provision? Post her work here
On one hand you want to improve waterways, while now allowing pollutants into our waterways! You just don't get it.
So Nestle can pump more?
How about Flint, Michigan ? Are you going there with all bodyguards & 1st class flying  on Americans taxpayers $$ ? After all you thrive on wasting our money. People that work hard for little $ don't mind that our Government spending so much on themselves.
No one can drink pollution.
As head of EPA is Pruitt trying to pass legislation declaring that dumping waste & chemicals into drinking water is now mandatory so fossil fuels industry can make a few more dollars?
This was approved under Obama lol

Scoop: Top EPA officials have discovered an email in which Sarah Greenwalt says, explicitly, that Pruitt approved her $56k-plus raise—despite his claim that he had no knowledge. Now they're scrambling to make sure it doesn't get in front of the IG. https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2018/04/pruitt-epa-raises/557561/ …

This is Samantha Dravis, the Scott Pruitt aide who was paid for full time work when she didn’t show up to the office for 3 months & is now being investigated for fraud…

Pruitt got caught in a lie. He approved unwarranted pay raises for staff cronies. #FirePruitt now. https://twitter.com/elainaplott/status/983417288996028416 …
You probably need to get a new job.
Run Sarah Run!

New EPA lawsuit claims that Scott Pruitt "covered up evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing" http://bit.ly/2EnJpOX  
Scott Pruitt is the king of fraud, waste & abuse. Now we find out he was fiddling around with his staff. He needs to go.

Why can’t we just get Scott Pruitt a clear backpack. He should be safe with that.

I CALL UNPRECENTED B.S, YET AGAIN!
Even as Pruitt slashed the EPA budget to give his Big Oil and Gas lobbiest buddies all his attention, he spent loads of Taxpayer money on... himself. #FirePruittNow  #DrainTheSwamp
Which friend does this deal benefit?
You should be fired
Abuse of power
Yea! Anybody fix that LEAK in the keystone pipeline yet? Maybe you could "upgrade" it! Oh! Wait! Its brand new!!!    DOH!
You don’t care I quit about clean water. You need to go! You are disaster for the environment, clean water and clean air. Just go!

All you do is lie
Going out for milk?

That’s pure BS and you know it.

You're a crook.

#FireScottPruittNow
Didn’t I tell you that you won’t lose your job because trump likes swampy people! Just to show how correct I am, I heard he wants to replace Sessions with you as attorney general! The trump swamp carries on in full force.
YOU’RE AN ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORIST. YOUR CORRUPTION IS BEING EXPOSED.

You need to lose your job, for the sake of our environment and the integrity of the country. If only there were one person in this administration who cared about such things. #FirePruittNow
Crooked Pruitt
Why is @EPA lying to protect the corrupt & lying swamp creature @EPAScottPruitt? FOIA requests show no records of any threats.
EPA says 'unprecedented' number of death threats against Pruitt https://fxn.ws/2Jt9K1V 
@EPAScottPruitt you suck bruh
Somebody please change the locks on the EPA building, too.
#hypocrites deserve what they get in the end - you perfect example of the #TrumpSewer
#FirePruit
TIs administration has done EVERYTHING to RUIN out water and environment under this CROOK who MUST BE FIRED and SOON. How many crooks do we have to tolerate? Trump is enough, but they’re all CROOKED THIEVES. How we’re so many people so IGNORANT who voted for this CLOWN .
Good start, thank you!  We really need to do something about these “chemtrails” ASAP.  This is a typical day in Orange County, CA. Strong Trump supporter and can’t stand what’s going on here (off topic but...). They are literally killing me.  Please hurry.
Why are you stopping the bottled water to the Flint people? Please prove it’s safe by using it for a month. #leadlined
No you are abusive and robbing America
Upgraded water system? Is for more of your polluted water to run through better pipes?

Pruitt is a thief & a liar.  He is stealing from the American people. Please bring charges or at the very least fire him and never allow him in politics again.

Houston, we have a problem. Buzzfeed’s @JasonLeopold submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to EPA for records of any death threats against Pruitt and was told there were zero records. https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/982822339502108672 …
You are now known as the Environmental Pollution Agency!
Cool. Given any other jobs to your mates you borrowed money from?

Funny watching liberals all of a sudden care about little spending after supporting the most spending administration (Obama) in history. #liberals=hypocrites
Is that supposed to suffice? You’re either willfully misleading the American people, or you’re incompetent and grossly ignorant.

We need over $1 TRILLION to fix our water infrastructure.

Can we forgo the raise for you buddies and continue to pay for water in Flint, you cheapskate?
Scott Pruitt to the American people...
Keep up the good work you fucking pin head. And yes, we are laughing at you. Good luck rebuilding your image

I looked on Trivago. The cheapest room in Washington is a youth hostel with bunkbeds at $81 a night. The $50 room Scott Pruitt got was a bribe from an energy lobbyist. Need your pipeline approved? Do it through…
Clean Water means -ELIMINATING artificial water fluoridation!!! This should not be left up to local politicians throughout the country!! EPA knows the dangerous/harmful effects!!  @POTUS @seanhannity @BreitbartNews

I was reading the piece exposing how much of a dirty little grifter you are and saw you're 49 yo. Daaaamn, you look 69 at least. Crime and deceit ages the body huh?
News of EPA senior counsel Samantha Dravis' resignation comes days after a senator asked for the EPA IG to review Dravis' time & attendance she didn't show up for work for most of Nov 2017-Jan 2018 "including an investigation of potential fraud committed"

Morrocco? (hahaha) what were selling? LNG? you are out there for the Fossil fuel industry its just mind boggling. Its like a rapist lying on a naked body and saying ''I'm just keeping her warm'' ... #ethics  #jail

You dumb ass, Pruitt, you bring our POTUS a bad name.  Just quit already. #Nepotism #USGovernment #MAGA @seanhannity @BillOReilly
After upping staff payrolls, depleting EPA staff....finally paying for your lodging (maybe not since I hear they had to kick you out and change the locks) how are you REALLY going to ALLOCATE these funds?  RESIGN YOU IGNORANT FOOL!

Any trips to Morroco planned?  Icahn is waiting for any NEW news. I hear Icahn had to clear your hiring before Trump agreed.
PRUITT (Feb 2016)  "Donald Trump would pose a threat to the U.S. Constitution if he ever became president".  Words from this sewer rat have PROVEN CORRECT!
You're a scavenger feeding off our hard earned tax dollars
Hey, did Jesus Christ ride in a private plane all the time? Stay in 5 star hotels? Oh wait, he was born in a manger. He actually preferred poor people over people like your oligarch class. You are not a follower of Jesus Christ. Maybe the anti-Christ.
Pruitt, are you still in denial of being chemically dependent?  Common knowledge here in Oklahoma, also the in house assistant who resign is the latest in a long line of government paid hook ups.Shameful!

I would like to know, as would the rest of the Nation, just when do you intend to start working for the people and the Nation. Water in Flint is still unfit for human consumption.  Water in the wine industry in California has been contaminated by one ingredient in RoundUp. ???
What, polluted water due to Pruitt denegrating clean water standards?
@EPA Stop stealing from the tax payers! Pruitt should be ashamed of his lavish spending!
WE want you gone you low life mooching user!! You are done feeding off the backs of the American PEOPLE!! And you will pay every dime back that you stole from us!! Karma!!! Its an ugly bitch when she wants to get paid and shes coming for you!
Get rid of Pruitt  a Criminal & thief
Strong earthquakes rock Oklahoma...  This is largely thanks to you, Mr. Pruitt...

@realdonaldtrump A 2 bits small-time crook from Oklahoma is blown out at the national stage.
Scott prefers corporate advice on the environment to the advice of scientists and environmentalists. Hey Scotty, since you don't like experts, maybe have a plumber do your next prostate exam.
*Not a slight against plumbers! Experts = in the relevant field.
Do you REALLY think taxpayers like myself work so that you can have all that security and money waste? Are you kidding me? Myself and my whole family could work our whole lifetimes and not even afford one year of your expenses.  Ridiculous!! Its criminal!
It now appears Pruitt is both corrupt and incompetent as court overturns his rollbacks!
Swamp monster tdogg brought in. You’re as crooked as a dog’s hind leg.
Article: EPA insiders bemoan low point in agency's history: 'People are so done'
Scott Pruitt is this administration's No. 1 Swamp Thing.  Shameful.

Pruitt's security team currently consists of 19 agents and includes a fleet of at least 19 vehicles. The size of Pruitt's security is unprecedented. No previous EPA chief has ever received a 24/7 security detail, the agency's inspector general has said. https://twitter.com/gelles/status/982705689368854529 …
Sure they are.
What was in your water when you were unresponsive?

Scott Pruitt held 25-times more meetings with industry representatives than environmental advocates during his first seven months in office, according to a Reuters analysis of his schedule. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt-industry/embattled-epa-chiefs-calendar-shows-industry-had-his-ear-idUSKCN1HD2G0 …

Hey Scott, are you also working on the @EPA's name adjustment too?
Considering your achievements so far, it is only just that you change Protection to Pollution. Just go ahead! Putin's Ho (@realDonaldTrump), will give you another pat on a back for it. 
Infrastructure is not EPA.
EP is about environment.
EP takes science.
Pruitt fired his scientists.
Pruitt is a political wonk.


Dear @realDonaldTrump: Dem wave continues to get stronger. So now I'm thinking, please don't fire @EPAScottPruitt. He's such a great symbol of the corruption and fraud, waste & abuse in your Administration.…

Well lets see, Flint Michigan is completely without drinking water - perhaps all the money you spent on security (because people said nasty things to you in airports) could have been better spent on A FEW THOUSANDS TRUCK LOADS of Poland Spring FOR THEM- self important fool - SAD

I went to law school with Obama and worked for him for 11 years. But had I violated even one of the many ethics rules that Pruitt has violated, I would've been shown the door immediately. The fact that Pruitt still has a job is a sign of how much Trump has degraded public service
