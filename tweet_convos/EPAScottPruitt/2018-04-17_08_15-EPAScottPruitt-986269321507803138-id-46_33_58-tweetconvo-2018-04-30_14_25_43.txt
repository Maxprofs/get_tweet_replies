Too bad Scott Pruitt is spending the money on armored SUVs instead of providing clean water for Americans.
Sucking up to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS won't matter when he discovers you've been hiding horrific toxic chemical test results in the air, water and soil. #GeoEngineering #Chemtrails #ClimateEngineering #ChemicalAttacks @WhiteHouse @KellyannePolls #TuesdayThoughts #Syria

@EPAScottPruitt reminds me of Dr Evil, although Pruitt is not an evil genius - JUST EVIL.

#FirePruitt
Did they also double the budget for bulletproof cars? You know, because you can never be too safe.
Swamp water.
BS
Oh look more money for your pocket.  Resign!
The @EPA is run by the traitor @EPAScottPruitt who would poison the world for a quick buck.
And gave you more money for inappropriate travel expenses.

So PRUITT spends 1% of what PELOSI spends on travel and "goodies/expenses", and we're hoping to attack him on THIS FRONT?
The left's hypocrisy NEVER ENDS.
Scott Pruitt needs to resign who does he think he is this is ridicules
Bullet proof seats for Pruitt? $43,000 phone? $50 condo? Now we know where republicans epa is spending taxpayers money, on themselves.
43, 000$ of our tax money for a sound proof phone-booth? Pruitt is a crook and a fraud.

Pruitt is wasting millions of taxpayer $ on his grandiose-Napelonic-urges. He needs to be fired. #BootPruitt #unfit #corrupt #fraudulant @chelliepingree @SenAngusKing @RepAdamSchiff @tedlieu @SenatorCollins #BootPruittNow
Why is rip-off artist Pruitt still at the E PA. Is it because of the spineless republicans in Congress that endorse trumpian waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayers?





Ha! How much more did defense get? Pittance for our people’s health.
Thanks Gina McCarthy for initiating program in 2014! I'm sure @EPAScottPruitt will find a way to spend the extra funding with developers that have ulterior motives, and anti-environmental corporate agendas that go directly against the intended purpose of the program.
Thanks to @EPAScottPruitt #corruption and misuse of taxpayer dollars has more than doubled at the EPA! #PruittMustGo
Pruitt Rentals Call Scott at #TheSwamp
Hahahaha that’s just crumbs
Funding is good. What is better however is to actually do something that improves our environment. Still waiting on Pruitt to demonstrate this.
Because without water there is no golf.
