EPA Year in Review 2017-2018
Please repeal the unncessary and expensive, absurd CAFE standards


Let’s discuss this.
For your information the EPA was provided a deadline of March 6th to Produce Scott Pruitt’s travel documents.

They are now almost 6 days past that deadline.…
Looking at what more you can destroy, you mean.
and they are??? going to share??
Did you find a way to kill the planet faster?
Surrounded by photos of yourself. Bit weird

Judge agrees with AG Ferguson that EPA violated the Clean Air Act by delaying air quality standards for ground-level ozone pollution – another successful outcome in a case that has not yet resolved. Ruling: http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/2018%2003%2012%20Order%20Granting%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf … Case background: …
Keep up the great pace #ScottPruitt. You've accomplished more in one year than the Kenyan did in eight. Actually most of the work is abolishing his destructive policies and putting in place sensible #environmental policies of #conservation &  #sustainability based on real science
You have brain damage


sir .i recpect u.welcome to u.
I would appreciate you adding one more act to your so called accomplishments, writing a personal ck for all the $ you have cost taxpayers for your travel and secret nefarious ways to prevent anyone knowing what you're up to.
It's wasted money, we already know that you're actively destroying the EPA and letting Big Corp dictate regulations - or lack thereof. You we're a disgrace to OK, now you're a national disgrace.
Goals for 2018 - line pockets with cash from polluting industry payouts and continue duping the American public. Seriously if you love Jesus, in your heart of hearts , I pray that you find wake up to all your sins against humanity and our planet.
Please do the planet a favor and focus on your resignation.
Most recent accomplishment... mistaking a rectangle for a circle
Pruitt’s a philistine concerning enviro-protection.  He’s clueless when it comes to the stewardship of air, water & land, he doubts evolution, doesn’t understand the scientific method & is a politician void of honor! Remove Pruitt, Impeach Trump! Protect our land, water & air!
Delusional.
You are f*ing up our environment
Don’t talk Pruitt.  You breath is bad for the Clean Air Act.

So many white guys
Thank you, Scott Pruitt, for caring about the people who live near the West Lake Landfill Superfund site. <3
#DoYourJob @EPA 
The @EPA admitted in this case that it failed to do its job & meet its deadline under the #CleanAirAct. Today, as a result of our lawsuit, the Court ordered the @EPA to comply by April 30. This is our 9th environmental legal victory against the #Trump Adm: http://bit.ly/2Im0USL  https://twitter.com/thehill/status/973281747193483264 …
Really? Have you brought "honesty, liability, and change" to the EPA? No. It's worse. Oh, and on March 29 you denied a petition to ban Chlorpyrifos?  That can cause neuro and autoimmine disorders. You sure can tell you care about the environment! Wiki and search facts! Enjoy 
Scott Pruitt, you are a horrible person.
Pruitt, you’ve accomplished ! You’re in it for the money and travel!
ANY mention of #GeoEngineering #Chemtrails spraying poisonous chemicals on every living, breathing thing, in our water and food supply? @realDonaldTrump @TrishaDishes @Chucksteak45th @SlicksTweetz @ImperatorTruth @OpChemtrails @PamJonesLiberty #SaveOurChildren #SaveTheBees #MAGA

Great job. Finally, an EPA Administrator willing to make the hard decisions necessary for 21st century mankind to flourish. It's about time. We've endured enough Green Tyranny to last a millennium.
are u hiring?
What accomplishments except destroying our environment

We’re going to look like Haiti soon. https://www.facebook.com/jonah.white2/posts/1850461578306300 …
You are basically committing crimes against humanity. Your understanding of science is absurdly inadequate.
This! Accountability.
#BREAKING: Federal court rules Trump EPA broke law by delaying Obama-era pollution rule http://hill.cm/vVBI87V  
Great photo - will compare against later mug shots to ensure everyone is incarcerated for their crimes
@EPAScottPruitt what seems to be the hold up?  No excuse for not meeting deadline.

Accomplishments my ass.
That’s a really diverse group you’ve got there.
Assume he was making a list and checking it twice to see how many more regs he could revoke that were meant to protect our environment.  Most despicable of all the Cabinet members ... even Betsy DeVose loses to him, and that is bad! #VoteWithVengeance  #VoteThemOut2018
Keep an eye out Mr. Pruitt. Don't let any new legislation slip through that would help the environment. You're fired.
resign in year 2. thx
E.g. overheating the planet?
Did you discuss how you think climate change is a good thing?
Increasing pollution, ignoring science, and cozying up with fossil fuel companies are not accomplishments.
Hopefully downsizing and deregulation that includes some way to stop EPA from being a drain on freedoms and burdensome to tax payers and business
Facts show @EPAScottPruitt keistered mayonnaise onto flight from KY.  Due to the mayo expanding at high altitudes, 12oz became over 32oz and blew out all over seat C5.  Flight attendants not happy to clean up.  #pruittmayoassfacts
All enjoyed sipping the kool-aid of self-aggrandizement, as #petropruitt swelled in pride
Exactly what have you done to PROTECT the environment? Everything I have seen is rolling back protections put in place by Obama. If this is accomplishment then you should be embarrassed to hold the office.
Either you DO YOUR JOB & protect our environment or you GTFO!!!
Big Oil, Gas & Coal
Environmental Terrorists (that’s YOU, a$$hole)

#FossilFuelsAreDead
#ClimateChangeIsReal
Destoried the environment. Check             Helped my buddies in big oil.     Check     Scared to talk to people in the communities and/or hold public meetings.   Check.         I need to waste tax payers’ money on first class airplane tickets, because voters do not like me.
What, you read a 7th grade Science text? Found another High School grad to put in charge of a Region?
Environmental rape and corruption?
Accomplishments?  Like putting toxic chemicals into our air, water and ground?  Like taking away regulations that protect us and our environment?  Like flying first class?
Didn't realize hurting Americans was such an amazing accomplishment for you
Accomplishment: Regularly refuses to talk to anyone who isn't an industry executive, avoids conversations with persons who actually know scientific facts and with persons who do not see his narrow, industry-slanted POV. #somuchwinning
Since your job is to protect the environment not line the pockets of corporate profiteers and big polluters, you should consider this billion dollar savings as a complete and total failure! #pollutingpruitt #fakeadminstration
Accomplishment: Named the Number One hated administration official of #45's cabinet, costing us taxpayers unheard of "security" and travel costs, so his fragile ego isn't damaged by people telling him the truth while he's visiting his cronies. #somuchwinning
Accomplishment: Overturned the anti-dumping rule for coal companies, allowing arsenic, mercury, lead and over a dozen other heavy metals to enter our waterways and, eventually, our drinking water.  #somuchwinning
Accomplishment: After publicly arguing that methane is more harmful to the environment than CO2, proceeded to overturn methane reporting requirement.  #somuchwinning
Accomplishment: Threatening lives & health of millions by delaying the ban on chlorpyrifos, just so his wallet-padding buddies at Dow Chem could make more money.  #somuchwinning
Scott this is you
Destroyer of our parks, resign!  
Never more will an okie have your position ....

#Corruption
Like saving industries millions of dollars by cutting back on regulations?  You really hate the U.S., don't you?
LOL, is it #AirPruitt or #PruittAir? 
How about this "accomplishment"? "Under Trump, E.P.A. Has Slowed Actions Against Polluters, and Put Limits on Enforcement Officers"
We have to make the #Environment and #ClimateChange a priority.
#CleanAir #CleanWater
I hope they impeach you first.
You have accomplished Nothing Other than enriching yourself and your corporate polluter buddies. WE ARE ON TO YOU, PRUITT.
Even more First Class tickets??
Was this one of your accomplishments? "EPA regulation cuts likely to hurt children most, experts say" "The new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has...taken steps in recent weeks to dismantle key environmental and health protection programs."
Scott Pruitt is just another example of this administration's attack on America. Pruitt, DeVos, the bunch of them make me so sad.
Me too. I try to be positive and take the high road, but I get more fired up every day.
You’re are quack Bad for the environment bad for America @NancyPelosi @tedlieu @RepSwalwell @RWPUSA

What accomplishments? Poisoning our kids. You will be held accountable one day
Those poor people sitting around the table with Pruitt. I wonder how many of them are dying to yell out, "CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL!!!"
Small group, by the way.
"Accomplishments: I'm making my big oil friends a ton of money and raping the environment at our children's expense because I'll be dead when the planet goes belly up so I don't care."
More oil. Meeting adjourned.
How about hiring back your competent scientists? #nowyouknow
You're agenda better focus on keeping existing regulations in place.
Boooo Scott Pruitt. Booooo.
Golf course chemical manufactures are pushing over-buying & over-applying toxic, EPA registered products. @realDonaldTrump owns multiple golf courses - may be a victim, just like us in little Rye, NY @EPAregion2 

My Series, Part 8 -
Include invasive species mitigation
"We successfully eliminated important safeguards, making it easier for the biggest polluters to damage the environment and make people sick."
#WhatPruittSaid
"We laughed as we reduced and eliminated fines for polluters, increasing the likelihood that pollution roll increase."
#WhatPruittSaid
"We met almost exclusively with business people, ignoring that Average Joes represent the greatest number of @EPA stakeholders in the country."
#WhatPruittSaid
"We spent exorbitant money on first class travel because I'm too big a wimp to hear the true opinions of actual stakeholders: Average Joes who largely can't afford first class."
#WhatPruittSaid
"We ignored the findings of THOUSANDS of scientists, choosing to pursue environmental protection based on belief, instead of rigorous study."
#WhatPruittSaid
Dang - and I thought I was mad!   Keep 'em coming!

Environmental accomplishments? 'Cause I bet that was a hella short meeting.
