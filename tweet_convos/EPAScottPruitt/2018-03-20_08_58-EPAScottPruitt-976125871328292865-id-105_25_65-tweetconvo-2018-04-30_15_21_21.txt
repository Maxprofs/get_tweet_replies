A lot of #conservatives suffer from #StrictFatherMorality: unresolved sexual repression; unbridled #machismo; #misogyny; #WombEnvy; god-is-male #BS.

A testosterone fueled outlook usually leads to #UsVsThem and irrational #ZeroSumPolitics propaganda.
. . . consider this #DoucheHenge border-wall #BS that keeps ~1/3 of the #electorate clinging to #BiblesAndGuns & #trump - oh my!

We truly need #women to gain more political control to quell this #zeitgeist of aggression and fear.

That time @EPAScottPruitt overturned a ban on a dangerous pesticides used on the food in kids’ lunches. #EPAInaction
And then, when pressed, @EPAScottPruitt said his office was “exploring ways” to pay for air monitoring even though he approves of a more than 30% cut to the EPA budget, that’s #EPAInaction.
You are a clear and present danger to America and Americans.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
#PollutingPruitt #FirePruitt
Seriously Pruitt what is wrong with you? You clearly have some psychiatric or neurological condition that has forced you to spend years trying to make the US a more polluted place. Your brain should be saved for research after your autopsy.
I'd suggest he donate it now, he doesn't seem to be using it much.
Failing to hold the oil and gas industry accountable for leaking dangerous methane pollution in our neighborhoods - that’s @EPAScottPruitt’s #EPAInaction
The hate and ignorance of the comments on this thread is telling about the sad state of the environmental community these days.
eat shit

As the former public affairs chief for two federal agencies (in two GOP administrations), I can tell you that this is an INSANE amount of money for any federal agency head to spend on travel and security measures. Off the charts. https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/976228540906655745 …
When you refuse to classify #Philadelphia in compliance (or not), for smog, and a federal court rules that the EPA, under its administrator, Scott Pruitt, broke the law by missing the deadline, that’s #EPAInaction.
When @EPAScottPruitt rolls back clean cars standards that lower pollution and save consumers money, that’s his #EPAInaction
who the hell is going to believe that?
Another sweet deal for corporations at the expense of our health. Resign
Also yes thank you to EPA’s third floor for being honest for once in your slogan “EPA Inaction”
Couldn’t even place the propaganda sign in full view for the photo smh

Liar
#SpendyScott #PollutingPruitt
You are an evil man! The world is watching!
You're a liar and a sociopath. Full Stop.

"Simplify"  Right.
End the EPA
Yeah, end the environment. There’s too much of it.
Is that what I said?
Bro, you are a champion climate denier and one of five non-oil company owners that supports Scott Pruitt’s actions. Damn right that is what you said.
I said end the EPA. Not end the environment. Stop lying.
“I didn’t say end the environment. I send end the agency whose job it is to protect the environment. I like the environment just fine. I just don’t deem it worthy of protecting. The environment is meant to be despoiled. Stop lying.”
The only thing you know how to due to screw us and the environment over!
My grandma taught me: "If you don't have anything nice to say about someone, then say nothing at all". But I'm pretty sure she would want to see @EPAScottPruitt die in prison also. #GrandmaWisdom
You sir, are a disgrace.  How do you live with yourself?
Aww you know meaningless buzzwords! You get a gold star!
Pay back the American taxpayer, you criminal. Then go directly to jail!
Shouldn't you be sitting on a flight fueled by baby seals and children's tears as you feast upon the remains of the recently deceased last northern male white rhino and drink a cocktail of polar bear blood and cialis? #asshole
We simply LOVE the #EPAInaction in failing to disclose the boss' flights and secret expenditures. Thanks, #SpendyScott!
Going all the way to Italy on the taxpayer’s dime and @EPAScottPruitt taking time for pasta making - that’s #EPAInaction!
Making it easier for your cronies to pollute I’m sure #Resign you hack
Agreed! #EPAInaction is totally what you're all about! You care about the savings for your polluter cronies, but people will be sick and die because of what you're doing. Disgusting. But, hey, at least you can fly 1st class and stay in swanky hotels, right? #SpendyScott
.@EPAScottPruitt, when you don't disclose your $100,000+ first class travel habits on the taxpayers’ dime, that's #EPAInaction. #PollutingPruitt #DefendOurFuture
You should resign for that hashtag alone
You must be pretty ignorant not know that some of the public subscribes to numerous U.S. gov't. sites and world news on environment.
Your actions protect no one but corporations
This grifter is stealing from the taxpayers at an alarming rate.
It's been quite proven that "simplifying regulations" doesn't save money. Trading short-term wins for long-term expenses (health, ecology, etc) is bad policy.
Where do I sign up to get some of my tax money back that you’ve been spending on first class travel, security guards, and other wasteful items? While you’ve been undoing years of hard-won environmental protection. Shame on you.
no, you just robbed citizens of their right to a healthy environment #ShameOnYou
Hoping you’re the one who gets cancer from the deregulation you think is good.   PS quit blowing my tax dollars on BS trips you arrogant pig.  Clear enough?
As long as they are oil companies
That hashtag doesn’t mean what you think it means.
How do you sleep at night knowing that you are personally responsible for destroying our air water and land so that corporate profits can be maximized?
A way for us to reduce the amount of gas in the atmosphere would be for you to eat farts, just a suggestion
You’re a pathological liar and a definitional sociopath. Nobody believes anything you say. Everything you do is to whore out the law and the public good to your corporate masters. Plus, you’re paranoid and dumb.
Carr to be specific?
Uh. Hey guys. I mean I guess it is accurate. 
LEAVE!
You’re a horrible person.
sweet hashtag moron
you are an embarrassment.
Your time will come, Scott.
Please resign.  We will never forget what you've done.
Why did you spend so much money going to Italy?  You should be fired immediately for being so wasteful.
LOL yeah right asshole
Resign and find another planet to live on. We don’t want you on this one.
Literally nothing you are doing protects human health & the environment.
 seems like almost everything you sign is a roll back or elimination.  Yeah simpler for business not sure about your claim on protecting the environment
Yes “simplify compliance with standards” since I am slashing and burning the standards in the first place.
Don't see a lot of support for you here..We know what you clowns are up to..People still have to live in the world you pollute for profits #Beatit
"Simplify compliance"?? Sounds like another break for #DirtyOil #BeatitYaStink
Scott Pruitt, and protecting human health in the same sentence lol!
Cost-savings..what the hell would you know about that? Livin' large, on our diime, eh Pollutin' Pruitt?
You’re straight-up lying. You have compromised human safety and protection of natural resources with EVERY action you’ve ever taken.

When will people realize that regulations R necessary to keep us safe & alive.We were able to reduce pollution because of regulations .@realDonaldTrump .@EPAScottPruitt 
destroying our environment.We will be wearing masks so we won't…
And it's made you so popular you can't fly in coach without incurring the ire of those whose health and environment you are 'protecting'  #industrylackey #staggeringcorruption #zeroethics
Puhleeze don’t talk about cost savings when you spent over $80K on trip to Italy! Using American taxpayers’ hard earned money. You’re despicable piece of sh*t
I saw the same thing as another: the hashtag “EPA InAction” sums it up! Pruitt and his minions have made more noise about nothing than I have ever heard from the EPA. Much ado about nothing is Pruitt’s new mantra
Is this the ‘Let Polluters Do Whatever They Want As Long As It Increases Profits Act’?
Maybe don’t fly first class and don’t build some private phone you demon.
Prioritizing corporate profits over public health

Short-sighted Pruitt strikes again
LIAR!
RESIGN
Without the help of the Russians YOU WILL NEVER BECOME PRESIDENT.  Come 2024 a new generation of voters will make sure of that. After the carnage you helped create Republicans will be lucky to win school board seats.
This song was recorded 3 years before your agency was founded. You have a duty to this country. Act like it.
This singer/songwriter was a hoot. Thanks for reminding me I haven't heard him in a while on recordings @youtube.
Terrific!  Save more taxpayer money so you can fly first class.  Scott Pruitt = #airpollution
#lessRegulations #lessGovernment
"Cost saving?

YOU, Scott, have blown HOW MUCH MONEY on personal luxuries and insane security measure for yourself?
Why the f*ck does an EPA director need black box personal security or an armed entourage of a several dozen?

You are personally a MONEY PIT.
I am sure the first part of the statement is true but the last clause is highly questionable with your record.
You are screwing our land & parks for your loyalist lying boss just so you can make money. Quit the job & recommend Anyone else but you.
Keep up the great work!
What are you, his Dad?

JUST IN: Cost of Pruitt's Italy trip rises above $84,000 http://hill.cm/PSvdVO7  
Your hashtag says it all!
#EPAInaction
The country has certainty that you are doing entirely the wrong things at the @EPA.
