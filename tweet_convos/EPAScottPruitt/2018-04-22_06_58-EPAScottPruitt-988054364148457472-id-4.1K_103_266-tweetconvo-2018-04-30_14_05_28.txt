As Americans, we desire that future generations inherit a clean, healthy environment that supports a thriving economy and we have made great progress improving air quality, cleaning up contaminated lands, and ensuring our bodies of water are safe‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs ONLY A ‚ÄúDESIRE‚Äù!
Hate to break it to you, but you‚Äôre not going to be President one day.
Looks me like me vs the  stalkers üñëhb
How dare you! You don't care about our Earth! You are destroying it with your lies and greed! Shame on you! You are no leader to protect our environment or anything else!!  #FirePruitt #RESIST #FIREGOP #CLIMATECHANGEISREAL #SAVEOURMOTHEREARTH
#PerscriptionMedProgressives
And you were a poorly picked nominee! You are not protecting the people!
you got some balls to say that, considering your the WORST EPA Admin in the history of the agency.  your tract record is abysmal, to say the least.  you should be jailed for what you've "accomplished"

This means nothing coming from you. Tell us again how allowing cars to release MORE poison into the air will save lives? #BOOTPruitt
Your level of corruption is disgusting. Your hatred of the planet & truth is obvious. Resign.
We don't believe a word you say! You are part of Trump's swamp that needs to be drained. Stop rolling back regulations that will negatively impact future generations!
You have to be fucking kidding me.. Maybe El Chapo can give an anti drug service announcement on how you should not do drugs.. or OJ running a domestic abuse organization.
.@EPAScottPruitt If the Earth is really important to our gvt, we'll hold companies like #hoaxwagen more accountable for what they've done to our environment #VWcorruption
Please!!!
You're kidding, right? 
This is like Jesus getting a Christmas card from Satan.

Go home #PollutionPruitt,
you're drunk with corruption.
@EPA @altUSEPA

You‚Äôre the opposite of that. Plus you‚Äôre corrupt and are stealing our money to buy $40,000 phone booths. You need to go.

Says the imbecile who doesn‚Äôt care about the environment at all !
Lol lol so this is the tweet that made libs lose it ???? Lol lol
Seriously??!!?? You‚Äôre the worst thing that‚Äôs happened to Her since acid rain.
@EPAScottPruitt how about you stop banning science?

Mr Pruitt has committed himself to undoing as many Obama-era environmental regulations as he can https://econ.st/2r6DjxP 
What have you done to make the Earth better today, Scott? Re-enter the Paris Accords? Acknowledge climate change? Recycle *anything* other than Trump talking points?

Anywho. I look forward to respecting the office again. Until then -

#Pruitt #EarthDay
Boo Scott you're a crook
hey, so uhhhh how's Flint doin'?
 Sincerely, EARTH and its PEOPLE....
It's been one year of amazing Scott Pruitt accomplishments, ALL OF THEM HORRIBLE https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2018/02/its-been-one-year-of-amazing-scott-pruitt-accomplishments-all-of-them-horrible/ ‚Ä¶ via @MotherJones
Scott Pruitt Has Become RIDICULOUS
Scott Pruitt's bad judgment
Things are not as dire as we've been told!  The only thing that has truly changed is, the world's vultures won't be able to rape America and her people as many, planed.
This from the corrupt fucknugget who has rolled back nearly every environmental protection measure? How does dumping coal waste in streams add to a cleaner environment?
No,no,no, you clearly do not understand!
See, when Jesus comes back we get a ‚Äúnew heaven and a new Earth‚Äù; if we don‚Äôt trash the planet he might never ‚Äúcome back‚Äù!
We can‚Äôt have THAT!
I‚Äôm sure you can see where this is headed.
I honestly hope your cynicism and willingness to feel validated by shitty people makes you die unhappy and alone.
Weird, I can hear you cackling while typing this.
I hope Mother Earth opens a sinkhole under your house and you disappear into it
Happy Earth Day, Scotty boy
#Hypocrite!!!!
Can‚Äôt you just see Pruitt,Jeff Sessions,
Clive Bundy slamming some beers

So you'll be leading the charge to clean Flint Mi water?

Didn't think so...keep stuffing that money in your pocket.
God called. He told us to tell you
LOL Are you taking the piss?  Good lord.
Thanks a lot Scott
BIGGEST swamp creature on earth.  Enjoy it now, bc you get back everything you put into this universe.
The nerve of some people.

Since the only thing you care about is money, not the environment or its protection, resign!
That‚Äôs not what you are doing!  You are putting more contaminants into our environment so the businesses don‚Äôt have to spend money to clean it up!  You‚Äôre basically making us sick
Resign.
Please stop #chemtrails. The sky isn‚Äôt supposed to look like this. Write new laws to protect the sky‚Äôs. They are poisoning us from above now. No #Monsanto. Please help!
Whoever runs your twitter account has no sense of irony!!   your policies are killing our Earth and it‚Äôs inhabitants so you and your cronies can make money.
You have to be kidding, right?
This is a joke, right?  You say happy Earth Day while you line your pockets with other‚Äôs money so you can pretend to be Mr Big Shot and impress people. Meanwhile our descendants have a big mess they will have to deal with and you‚Äôll be remembered in history as a climate rejector.
Oh you certainly have sick nerve.....
You‚Äôll be out of office soon. It‚Äôs going to get real weird when you have to face us in public. The rest of your life as a hated pariah. See you in coach bro.
lol gfy
The (fossil fuel and chemical industry) economy being supported is the ONLY part of your tweet this is truthful.
Oh, and water "for commerce" - that is your truth as well.


Like getting a thank you note from your rapist. https://twitter.com/EPAScottPruitt/status/988054364148457472 ‚Ä¶
Earth Day is in mourning until you and this administration are gone.
Don't pretend you care, just resign.
SERIOUSLY? Also, congrats on the NYT article! #earthday #https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/us/politics/scott-pruitt-oklahoma-epa.html
Also, no one likes you.

P.S.:  eat a bag o' dicks, Pruitt
#swampMonster #DrainTheSwamp Hurry @realDonaldTrump you promised to drain it.  #startNow
With all due respect, fuck you!
You are a truly loathsome creature.
You, Mr. Administrator, have assured that the earth will not have a chance at being the "clean, healthy environment" the Obama administration was striving to create. You have sabotaged any hope of that with your self-serving, earth-trashing policies. There is a place in hell 4 u!
RESIGN you bum!!
Awfully glib, don't you think


Pruitt has done nothing for the environment, and profitted greatly on taxpayer money.

That's the Trump bump.
Now quit.
F U, @EPAScottPruitt ! - Earth 
Happy #EarthDay2018, indeed. Looking forward to your exit, in disgrace, from the @EPA. Take your corruption and your secure phone booth back to Oklahoma. Your children should be ashamed of their father and the damage he's personally done to our planet.
Please stop. The hypocrisy.
#Pruittrefaction
Thank you Scotty. Please help meeeee
i‚Äôm just here to contribute to that sweet sweet ratio

Burn in hell.

You are complicit in destruction of our only habitat.
Would you like another slice? 

Scott Pruitt
 
Poisoner in Chief
Good Lord, you're a massive hypocrite.
If you resign they might, need someone that cares for the earth .
You know what would make this a true Earth Day celebration? You know, Scott. Resign. YOU are the biggest threat to America's physical environment. You support the very things that place all life at risk. #DoItPruittResign
Corrupt hypocrite.
And the Earth lies bleeding...
Oh resign already
He can‚Äôt hear all of these negative comments in his sound proof...
LOL
You make me sick.

Your hypocrisy and corruption won‚Äôt  be tolerated much longer. #BootPruitt  #HellIsWaiting #Prison

You forgot to linestrike "clean, healthy" from the retweet

You @EPAScottPruitt have done nothing to help the environment!  Your rollback of regulations has made our air & water more polluted, and put our farmland at risk - the list goes on and on. On top of that, you are one of the MOST corrupt people in 45*‚Äôs Administration. Shameful!
Is this a joke? As if you care....
Happy Massive Coronary to you.
Fuck off you corrupt greedy incompetent moronic unethical selfish dumbfuck.

Administrator Pollution is more like it.

Go fuck yourself.
#Hypocrite

You‚Äôre about 21 days late on this, Scotty!
As @JohnFugelsang said, "the best thing about climate change deniers is they won't be around to hear their great-grandchildren cursing at them".
He says as he sets out to destroy her and rob taxpayers of as much money as possible? I can‚Äôt wait til you and your delusions of grandeur are fired. Even Republican lawmakers are horrified by you.
Are you serious?
You‚Äôve got to be kidding. You and your actions represent the exact opposite of environmental protection.
Friggin hypocrite

Are you kidding me?!!  Seriously?!   This is the Onion, right?!   You are destroying our planet. For God‚Äôs sake, leave now!!!
Seriously. You are like the earth destroyer on steroids.  And all for your own aggrandizement and profit. You disgust us and cost us money. Please resign. (Your message was downright Orwellian.)
Regulations are often quite important for health and safety.  It's so sad that you are working so hard to destroy them and return us to this:
From Earth to you:
I'd read your tweet but it's covered in coal
Screw you
That is until you came along
You have a lot of nerve you unethical weasel--you are literally the nemesis of The Earth.
GFY and then #Resign

$2.5 billion in proposed cuts to the EPA. https://twitter.com/epascottpruitt/status/988054364148457472 ‚Ä¶
Oh look! The Head of the #EPA  (Environmental POLLUTION Agency) has taken a rare moment away from siphoning our tax dollars for his own personal gain, to pretend to care about the earth.
#EarthDay2018
Don‚Äôt you mean #HappyPlunderDay, Swamp Thing?
You should resign now.  But I'd be happier to see you in jail.  #investigatePruitt #PruittMustResign
RESIGN
Not only dismantling, but rubbing our noses in it.  I‚Äôll be happy when you are fired.  It‚Äôs coming!
Surely this is parody!  We know he works everyday to harm the environment so as to line his pockets!  Grifters gotta grift!
Is this some kind of sarcastic piss in the eye to Americans? You are the worst thing to happen to clean air & clean water in decades!  #FirePruitt  #EarthDay #cleanenergy #cleanairnow
we should enjoy it now before u destroy it.
Like getting a thank you note from your rapist. https://twitter.com/EPAScottPruitt/status/988054364148457472 ‚Ä¶
It will be, when you resign or are fired.

Recyclops would destroy you.
seriously?
This has to be tweet 1 of 2 right? I mean, it's true that as Americans we have made said progress, but the stated objective of @EPAScottPruitt is undoing them.
You‚Äôre so bad at this.
YOU haven‚Äôt done any of those things. In fact, you‚Äôre trying to take all the progress we have made away from us.
We would be better off with #WalterPeck
destroying our physical country and raping the US taxpayers blind---what a guy.  Prison awaits!
Tweet don't speak the environment doesnt need the noxious gas emissions caused by your foul words
Resign pig
And the Earth  says to you...
What are you afraid of? We really want to know. You are the most paranoid SOB that is currently walking the face of the Earth. WHAT IS IT?
Boo this man.
Sad to hear about your miss use of $$$$$$$$ you have become out of touch from the reality of life in America. #greed #getbacktoreality #cantaffordrentinnj #everythingdonewillcomebacktoyou
Thank you sir.
Are you fu‚Ç¨king kidding?  YOU wishing anybody a Happy Earth Day is 100% BULL$H!T.
Can‚Äôt wait until you are finally booted out of there!
dude, read the room
Really?
REALLY? Is this a joke? 
F.U.
How do you not see the irony in this?
Obviously, someone hacked Scott Pruitt‚Äôs Twitter account and sent this message
Fuck you.
