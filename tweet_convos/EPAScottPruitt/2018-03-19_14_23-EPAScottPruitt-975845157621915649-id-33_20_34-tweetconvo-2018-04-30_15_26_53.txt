You are doing nothing to protect the public health. I really don’t understand what your agenda is other than helping already wealthy people become wealthier. It is disgusting.
You leading @EPA is the worst part of this whole President Trump fiasco.
The links between climate change and health are huge. Thank u for using your position of leadership to help protect the American people. God Bless You.
SPOILER ALERT: He's not doing what you say he's doing.
Somehow, some way, there's something in this for you & the #FossilFuel industry. I don't know anything about chemistry, but I bet it has something to do with encouraging PFAS alternatives derived from natural gas, oil, & coal. #PollutingPruitt @jclement4maine
You do know that not one person living believes a word you say  ?
ECOS Executive Director Sambhav (Sam) Sankar is an attorney that is experienced in lawsuits that fight for POLLUTION!!!!! This is sickening. @EPAScottPruitt is sickening.
FULL OF !!!
Are you participating from your sound-proof booth???
Funding PFAS research would be a great start
you're incompetent................... save Lake Erie from algae and Asian Carp
I am one of your stakeholders.  Please let ma know time and place and I will be there to help.  Thank you kindly.

#FakeNews from a sleazy dime store con..
CEOs of oil and coal companies are not the stakeholders that should have any say in the environment. You are just a corporate shill who takes bribes and could care less about the department you lead.
I'll believe it when I see it.
What exactly qualifies you to speak as an authority figure on “public health,” Gargamel?
Don't you mean protect your money?  No one believes your bs.
Still screwing the taxpayers with your first class travel? Still screwing tHE taxpayers with your SECRET TRAVEL WHERE YOU CONSPIRE WITH POLLUTERS TO ENABLE CONTINUED POLLUTION?
You mean to harm the environment and national health? Right?
Don't forget you have a Trust Responsibility to the Tribes, time for consultation; it happens before you make decisions not after.
And scientists? Any science input Scotty or is this just another of your ‘brainstorm a way that we can continue to impact human health and the environment with no consequences’ sessions with industry? You know, payola.
now if you would only use science to inform your work
#PruittisPoison
If your involved we can rest assured the only “interested parties” you’ll contact are the polluters and the only action you will consider will be aimed at letting them run wild without regard to the damage caused to the public.
#ScottPruitt, you are doing a fantastic job and righteously bringing back logic and common sense to the mandate of the people. #Environmental #conservation and #sustainability is finally being implemented after years of destruction by the Kenyan.
Prediction: Pruitt’s summit results in voluntary compliance programs translating to continued profitability for corporations making products that poison people.
Dear Sir please consider using technical impracticability waivers as the former EPA administration has restricted its application.
This song was recorded 3 years before your agency was founded. You have a duty to this country. Act like it.
