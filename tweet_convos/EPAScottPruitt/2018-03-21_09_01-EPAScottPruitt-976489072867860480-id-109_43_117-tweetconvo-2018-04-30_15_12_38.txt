Please surprise us all by resigning.
None of you leftists get the fact that he’s trolling the hell out of you.
Dude I posted this a minute before you replied to me, of course I get it:
This asshole is trolling us while we discuss his travel and security expenses. https://twitter.com/epascottpruitt/status/976489072867860480 …
Ok good. At least he’s funny.
I don’t like government waste anymore than you do. My problem is that liberals are now fiscally conscious after we spend 113 billion a year taking care of illegal aliens but can’t spend 25 billion to keep them out. 

Michelle jetting around the world on luxury also.
So does Melania (who is 1st lady so it’s ok) But what about Ivanka, Jared, Kellyanne, Pruitt, the VA affairs guy, Tom Price, Ben Carson, Zinke, etc. 
If Obama officials had done this, they would’ve been fired. Same with Bush. Let’s get real and admit this isn’t okay.
Price did get shit canned
You do know there is a difference between climate and weather right?  It’s a science thing, I know you’re more concerned with fossil fuel jobs than science.
And no guilt at all that you know full well about #WeatherManipulation #GeoEngineering spraying poisonous chemicals on us 24/7? #ClimateEngineering #SRM #HAARP @TrishaDishes @ImperatorTruth @AdolfTwittler8 @SlicksTweetz @SteerMark @NOAAClimate
Those are not chemicals.  Those are condensation clouds of cooling water vapor.  Not unlike seeing your breath on a cold winter day.

I know you won't believe me, but I am compelled by my good conscious to state it.
In good conscious, I must state that that is absolutely false. #GeoEngineering #OpChemtrails #ClimateEngineering #Agenda21 @Masschemtrails @SteerMark @PamJonesLiberty #TheGreatAwakening

It's ridiculous--and outrageous--that you are restricting scientific-data use in EPA policymaking. Policies should be grounded in scientific research--not upon impulsive whims. Supporting scientific data's use in decision making is why we are an advanced, innovative society.
Advancements in disciplines--primary & sec. education, engineering, technology, behavioral sciences, communications, etc--are attributable to practicing science: problem ID, collecting & analyzing data from scientific research, refining methodologies, ID'ing limitations, etc.
Either you're too dense to get that, easily manipulated by corrupt intent, corrupt yourself, or just plain dumb.

Guess who isn't shoveling.....  snow at least

1) “We need more people connecting the dots about how climate change is already affecting people and will continue to do so in the future,” says Bernadette Woods Placky, Climate Central chief meteorologist and director of Climate Matters. By linking local impacts to
2)  larger changes, Climate Matters aims to empower people to prepare for impacts like heatwaves, flooding, elevated food prices, and health situations. “We meteorologists need to show people global climate change and what it means to them.

Brrr!  Global warming 
Let’s be clear you FOSSILIZED TWIT! Snow on the second day of spring on the East Coast is NOT a “beautiful surprise”. It’s called AN ENVIRONMENTAL WARNING! Meanwhile the only contribution you’ll be known for is leaving your lineage an unlivable planet!

You're a quack unqualified for your job please resign President Nixon is rolling over @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @JoyAnnReid @RepSwalwell @tedlieu
@SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader @SenateMajLdr @RealBenCarson 
AND quite frankly at least Ben Carson had the graciousness to explain & apologize & CORRECT his indiscretion with the dining table-YET YOU always have a look on your face like some petulant kid who just got away with something
Its called climate change and we want our tax money back. #Resign


Yes, can you sign some sort of “Reg” that will ban that from happening? You are doing everything else to f**k up the environment, why not make snow illegal? Sessions could enforce the ban. Now go take a first class flight and cost us more money ...Ur good at that too! @GOP
Ah just beautiful. 
“It snowed today so climate change isn’t real.” -Assholes
@SenateMajLdr @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump 
YOU KNOW the government and the money in the government isn't a slush fund for YOU Pruitt YOU don't have carte blanche to run around and do everything and see everything and buy everything you want WHAT A CROOK-WHAT A MESS!!

What a beautiful surprise! 
You don’t get to gut the @EPA after all! 
Hopefully, all those lawsuits catch up to you real soon.
#PollutingPruitt #PoisonousPruitt #FirePruitt #Trump #EPA
You sure that’s not coal ash? Taste it, you said it’s safe, remember 
WOW! You are so corrupt!

Pruitt's security detail flies with him on first class
Go coach you leech on taxpayers.  We’re fed up with your entitlement & waste of our money, while you actively work to destroy environmental protections.
It’s nice that you took a break from destroying 48 years of progress to appreciate nature
You really are clueless about science, are'nt you?
Science could explain how snow is created and why it falls OR your big-bucks insecticide industry friends might have another explanation.

As the former public affairs chief for two federal agencies (in two GOP administrations), I can tell you that this is an INSANE amount of money for any federal agency head to spend on travel and security measures. Off the charts. https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/976228540906655745 …
Dumb Ef #Noreaster4 in a month #ClimateChangeDenier
Why did u need 2 spend $25k 4 secure phone booth 4 your calls?Y did u spend $68k 4 1st class flights in 6 mos incl 4 days in Morocco?U take more aids w/u than predecessors.U say u need 24 hr security(incl @work) b/c u were “harassed” by passenger in coach.Mayb b/c of yr decisions
What a perfect day for you to resign!
not that surprising ... google “climate change”
Surprise? Weather forecasts have been talking about it for days.  Oh wait - I forget you don’t believe in science so you’re totally clueless!  #ResignNow
We had earliest hurricane in 2017.3 cat 4 hurricanes, Harvey (dropped 27 trillion gal. of water,most rainfall ever 4 tropical storm&devastated Houston),Irma& Maria (both were cat 5)hit US as cat 4-Irma hit FL;Puerto Rico destroyed by Maria&still no elec!Storms r getting stronger!
See that's is Gods way of laughing at use humans .. saying ha you think you guys rule ... but I do love the snow ****
This is proof that #GlobalWarming is fake, and the coming #IceAge draws nigh. (using the #Moonbat #GreenReligion #ClimateChange Alarmist logic)

RESIGN, you corrupt, criminal, unethical grifter @EPAScottPruitt!!  Stop wasting taxpayer money, you're not a king, or a prince, or POTUS.  You are an employee of the American public.  Do your JOB and stop stealing our money!
NEW: Photos obtained by @ABC show EPA head Scott Pruitt deplaning a plane chartered from the military at JFK last June. Pruitt flew the government aircraft from Cincinnati, where he attended an event with Pres.…
No matter that it's spring
No matter that there's snow
You'll always be
The worst person I know.
#WorldPoetryDay @EPAScottPruitt
Clearly the work of His Noodly Appendages.

Please respect mother nature a little more
Go to Hell Pruitt! You're a lying piece of crap guilty of destroying our water, habit, air and environment! Better double your security and stay out of site asshole! The end is coming for you, Trump and the entire administration! Oklahoma hates you too!
That you still continue to mock the people you’re slowly killing, that is your most worrying treason to your country and planet. Resign.

Yes, and I was told it was a thing of the past.

You spending $50K on a phone booth is surprising! You do not have a job that requires secrecy. All EPA actions should be completely public.
Hey fucker!  I forgot... mess up my air and water... you’re toast!
The cold and suffering populace of the East Coast demands their global warming now !
Global warming is still real.
Climate engineering is real too.
How much of the taxpayers money are you spending on lavish trips today?
#FirePruitt
Can you turn it into oil, bozo?
Sincerely hope someone hits you in the face with a snowball. Preferably one that is mostly made of ice.
Would be more beautiful with you gone from office. Or preferably in a jail cell
Resign
.@EPAScottPruitt #Global cooling is a b$tch.
This is funny and all the more so because Climate Cultists are the most humorless of all SJWs. You can almost hear the screams of rage and impotency.
Hey farmer farmer
Put away that D.D.T. now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
'Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
What a terrible surprise, a career fossil fuel enabler becoming the head of the EPA. #ResignNOW we deserve better
I hope Pruitt uses pages from Obama's EPA Endangerment Finding to wipe his butt with each night.
Do you usually wear a helmet?
With you in office, someday I'll tell my grandchildren, "yes I remember when it used to snow."

Time to arrange a flight to someplace warm?
You’re asking for it here...
Did Inhofe tell you to tweet this?
I see what you’re doing there.  

#ClimateChangeIsReal
I don't know if this is the funnist or saddest tweet I've ever seen
somehow this feels like global warming trolling
climate change

Honestly can't tell if this is supposed to be a climate science subtweet or if you're actually excited about it snowing.
Whaaaat, someone like you, who lets big polluters pollute with impunity thinks snow is beautiful.
Your smugness and your ignorance invigorate me everyday to not only reduce my dependence on fossil fuels, but educate everyone I know about the dangers of climate change. I like to think that you are inadvertently expediting the demise of coal and oil industries.
That's not snow, that's ash from all the coal fires you have enabled with your science-denying, regressive, pro-pollution, anti-health deregulation agenda.
#ImprachPruitt
the irony of someone accusing someone else of denying science, when they don’t understand that the earths climate has been changing since the beginning of the earth. What humans changed the climate before humans? Use you brain a little. It helps.
Is it beautiful because your boss thinks cold WEATHER in ONE region in ONE time period implies global warming is a hoax?
We can't expect an answer if you're with your beautiful-clean-coal buddies.
Everyone else: Here are the enlightening words from Professor Trump himself:
Haha, so funny! Gotta love the irony.

#USA #Trump #GOP

This short video, produced by @NASA is a great visual on arctic melting. https://twitter.com/BryanDruzin/status/974072381437198336 …
This is @EPAScottPruitt subtle way of mocking 'anthropogenic global warming' hysteria, and false narrative. Good for him.
Enjoy it before the climate changes. I’m sure you’ll deny that so you can keep getting money from coal companies. 
You know this is exactly how The Day After Tomorrow started.
That was a movie
Really? And all this time I thought it was a documentary. Thanks for clarifying.
Exactly what was your purpose for going to Italy on the taxpayer dime and who traveled with you?  Those who footed the outrageous tab wants to know details.
That won't stop you from ruining the environment.
You are a piece of work...
Great. Ammo for the climate denier
