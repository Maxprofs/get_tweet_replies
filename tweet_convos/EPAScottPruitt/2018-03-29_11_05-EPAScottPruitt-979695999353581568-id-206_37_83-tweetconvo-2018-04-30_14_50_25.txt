Bull crap  NOTHING is being done and by the way Heroin overdoses have been a crisis since the 70’s but no one cared because it only afffected the poor!
Deflecting much? Stick to environmental issues, please. You’re not doing a great job there, btw.

have a few
Why is the fucking EPA tweeting about this??
Then START HOLDING BIG PHARMA ACCOUNTABLE! MCKESSEN! PURDUE PHARMA! You know SCOTT the guys responsible 4 flooding the market w/ opioids w/ only on      -  whose the lobbyist you’re shaking up w/ btw? Big pharma by chance? You’ll be gone by Memorial Day! Start packing!
Absolutely false. Skewed and disingenuous numbers provided by CDC to facilitate Rehab Corps rhetoric pushing for addiction facilities. Any death that had any drugs in pathology listed as drug related, no matter official cause of death.
ex-addict says these opioid addicts need to take responsibility for THEIR decision to abuse opioids. I did cold turkey.
This has nothing to do with the mission of the EPA.  If @EPAScottPruitt cares more about the opiate crisis than the environment he should quit the EPA & join HHS. Hey Scott - don't let the door hit U on the ass on UR way out cuz I slammed it!
Honest to God, what other crisis matters other than having clean air and water? What is wrong with you? Sleeping on the job and agreeing to pollute our waterways and reduce emissions , do your job man or get the hell out!!
So why don’t you guys talk to the doctors were writing the prescription so they can win junkets and gifts from big Pharma don’t you know that we see through you people and we will get rid of all of you you’re disgusting Republicans
Lol this is a damn joke
People who need these drugs will suffer because of this Opioid Campaign because that's what America does.  They always take it too far and don't think about the ppl who might really need these drugs. Rich parents whine about their addicted kids and America takes action. This.....
How is anyone with the EPA 2017-2020 on the resume going to get a job anywhere but Koch Industries?

You people are more toxic and ethically repugnant that a Superfund site.
Are you promoting Trump with this tweet? You're not addressing environmental protection.
It's not illicit drugs you moron! It's big pharma! Stop the stream of lies from your money laundering agenda!
More children have respiratory diseases now more then ever due to poor air quality!
Why are you talking about opioids? And why are you approving gas leases? Your job is reduction of pollution and toxins and protection of the environment and is citizens.
I think there are additional issues you can address in your position to make sure our future water sources and air is as clean as can be. I care that my kids and future grandkids have this.
Opiods are not the responsibility of this negligent EPA.
Why is the EPA tweeting this, aren't you the Environmental Protection Agency?
You actually have a particular role to play, not all roles.

Scoop: Top EPA officials have discovered an email in which Sarah Greenwalt says, explicitly, that Pruitt approved her $56k-plus raise—despite his claim that he had no knowledge. Now they're scrambling to make sure it doesn't get in front of the IG. https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2018/04/pruitt-epa-raises/557561/ …
Well start with the drug companies. They are the guilty ones. False advertising. Follow the money..Next the salesmen, the Doctors and kick backs. What do you expect when they hook someone on opioids and then stop the prescription?
He's "confronting the crisis" with talk, not money.  He's full of hot air, and it's toxic hot air.
How about the opioids pumped out by big pharma? Oh wait, they own you.

Unethical prick.  Resign.
.@EPA NYP = Not Your Problem, stay in your lane & protect our environment. #BootPruitt
Scott Pruitt's priorities:

-Pruitt spent over $163,000 on extravagant airline travel last year.…
Even Richard Nixon knew what was the role of the @EPA since he created it. Concentrate on OUR ENVIRONMENT not on opioids. This is ridiculous! That’s why we have departments.
Opioids are the responsibility of the CDC, not the EPA.
We need to fund many more TREATMENT programs...
Liars
This had nothing to do with the EPA.

The 3 "i"s:
Irrelevant
Incompetent
Immoral

This is our EPA today.
Yes with no money!  Idiots and racists
Since when does the epa spout propaganda? Environmental protection agency. It’s your name. Your job. Do it.
Your security is your only friends and they hate you.

Focus.
EPA works to ensure that:
Americans have clean air, land and water;
Riiiiiiiight.
To reduce drug abuse we need decent paying jobs. Nobody should have to need two and three jobs to pay the rent and be stressed out constantly.
Personally, I don’t think that anyone in government is worth a 30-person security detail. Least of all you.
That’s not the point. Opioids can be a crisis AND the climate should be protected, simultaneously
CROOKED GOVERNMENT!
#SleazyScott works for Energy Lobby NOT the Environment or Public Health hurt by high auto emissions. Condo, phone booth, 30 guards? #SwampRatScott @realDonaldTrump @EPAScottPruitt @maddow
Pruitt's ethics are arguably deplorable and his conflicts of interest indisputable. He needs to be throw out on his butt and the PEA must be restored to a credible watchdog of citizen interests. Drain the trumpian swamp!
Why were you " napping"?
I don't know about anyone else but @EPA investigators work for @altUSEPA Scott Pruitt. A discount apartment is a gift everywhere else in the world except at the @realDonaldTrump administration. Blatant conflicts of interest, self dealing is very apparent to the American people.
#RepublicanShitShow
you know who really had a great pod on what can be done RIGHT NOW about the opioid crisis that's nowhere on this govt website? @PreetBharara
Do you really care about the Opioid Crisis? Or about any of the past and present Environmental Crises for that matter? Can you answer honestly whilst looking at your children in the eyes? And the last question Mr Pruitt, why are you not promoting #RenewableEnergy? Please explain!
https://shareblue.com/scott-pruitt-epa-taxpayer-money-disneyland/amp/?__twitter_impression=true …
Do you expect anyone to believe that you give 2 cents about anyone addicted to anything? Please, you care about making money - that's all.  And you care nothing about the people who need help.
And what have you done to promote a safer environment for us now and our kids in the future? You are in the pocket of both the taxpayers and industry to enrich yourself. "White House annoyed with EPA Chief" is the headline! So are the taxpayers! Resign - man with no integrity!

what in the world is Scott Pruitt thinking?

As a scientist speaking to what should be a scientific organization, you should damn well know these are not mutually exclusive problems nor related in any substantial way. I've given scientific talks to "you" and I know your scientists know better. Those that remain, at least

are you SERIOUSLY going to reduce emissions requirements? You are a transparent corporate shill. GFY, sir.  Wait for the midterms!
Hit the Road Pruitt. You've Milked the American Tax Payer enough. Your 1st Class Travels, Protection when at Cultural Events, Renting from Lobbysts that are also donating to you.... I can see your Ethical Standards are in Dire Straits.
Please leave the Opioid Crisis for @HHSGov to handle. Why don’t you worry about @EPA & all the terrible decisions @EPAScottPruitt is making. More people will die because of your irresponsible, greedy decisions to rollback regulations that prevent harming humans & our environment

Pruitt is "ethically compromised."  Get him out!  Lock him up!

You are a criminal & enemy #1 against the environment. You have NO right to overturn regulations DESIGNED TO PROTECT AMERICANS. You abuse taxpayers money by taking 1st class travel almost weekly to Oklahoma to prepare for your Governor's run....SHAME SHAME SHAME
Why are you hurting American TaxPayers by taking 1st class private jets to Morocco? You were trying to sell liquid gas for your benefit, not for us everyday Americans. Why do you want to hurt us TaxPayers? We're just trying to make a living. Why do you think yer better than us?
It's being said that Pruitt's security team tried to rescue him because he may have been ODing.  Pruitt has currently been clean for 2 months.
Good luck on your recovery.

Something is very wrong with this guy.
Pruitt needs to go.
Turns out Pruitt is both a climate denier and bent on destroying the Environment of the US, to the benefit of American Corps. Now we find out he went to Morocco to sell liquified natural gas for the company that owns the home where he resides in Washington. That’s corruption * 10
You are unethical and should be fired!!!!

Confirming that your real job is making sure Trump likes you and not protecting the environment.
Yes, this is an issue, but this falls out of the scope of the EPA's mssion. Scott Pruitt needs to step down!
Big surprise: more corruption from the Trump crew, as Don busily weeds out the remaining honest ones. One honest apple could spoil a rotten barrelful!
What do you need a $30k security detail for?  Two-thirds the nation don't even know who you are!  Does it make you feel bigger?  First class fares  on taxpayer dollars, shame shame.
What about tax payers paying for your security when you took personal vacations and trips home?
Where you heading this weekend on my dime, Scotty? First-class, security-team sittin' mofo wastin' taxpayer $$$ like a john on a Viagra OD in a whorehouse.
You are such a piece of crap. If there is any justice, you will get sick from something in the environment - and suffer what generations will suffer from your decisions and actions.

Scoop: Scott Pruitt did pay rent for his lobbyist friend’s condo — $50 a night, and only on nights when he actually slept there.

@jendlouhyhc and I reviewed the lease and payments.…
Scott Pruitt needs to be fired. He is using taxpayer money for frivolous travel. He doesn't care about our environment, he only cares about how much money he can pocket. 
The crisis is your leadership and the thousands of deaths you will cause. You are a crook and a crime against humanity.
Please focus on protecting our environment - another department is responsible for addressing the opioid crisis.

Please RETWEET
if you agree this menace to society should be removed
- Scott Pruitt -
The environment needs protecting from #Trump’s…
ps. The opioid was another Republican agenda item to make money & get campaign funding by hamstring the FDA. Why don't you pass legislation that doesn't favor the big pharma distributors? You could do that...just sayin' & ask Tom Marino wtf he was thinking!
Sounds like subterfuge: Look over there while you intend to poison the environment.
Stick to PROTECTING the ENVIRONMENT!  Reversing environmental protections will harm thousands more for GENERATIONS!
Your first phrase sums it up - "Not an environmental crisis". Why don't you address those? #BootPruitt Scott Pruitt is a crook.
Promoting. Congress needs to act. I am guessing they won’t.!
This is what’s KILLING AMERICANS!
Let's not pretend @EPAScottPruitt cares about people - his polluter-friendly policies make it abundantly clear that's not the case. Pollution kills, too, and he's made gutting the safeguards that protect people a cornerstone of his tenure.
His new policies are not dangerous? He will move on a destroy what agency next.

Hey Scooter, you still getting that sweetheart rent deal from the energy lobbyists?

I am not pro opioids, but I am incredibly frustrated by the misdirection of this post. Also very frustrated and disgruntled by the actions of this administration.
How the hell is this an EPA tweet?
It isn't ... smart people get that. He wants you to look at Opioid issue than the systematic idiocy with intent on ruining the planet starting with our National Parks. Money? Nahhhhh

This is odd. Prescription drugs are an environmental problem, when they get released into the environment. EPA is so used to ignoring its own mission it doesn’t even see its place in admin priorities?
