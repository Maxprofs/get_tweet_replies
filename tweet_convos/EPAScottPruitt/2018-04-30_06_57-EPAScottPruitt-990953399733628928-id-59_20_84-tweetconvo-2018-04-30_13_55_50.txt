Happy Small Business Week- especially those owned and controlled by your cronies, amirite, Scott?
Why are you still in office?!?! #Resign Pruitt!!
"Protect Human Health" ... how exactly? What a joke
Small business owners like Carl Icahn?
Happy Small Business Week from @EPA! We are committed to supporting small businesses as an integral part of our efforts to let them pollute our human health and the environment so they can make more profits. Fixed it for you!
#SmallBiz
The only things you are committed to are corruption and self-enrichment. #PruittMustResign
So for small business week you type out a whole tweet but for Earth Day, you can only muster a generic hashtag?
#priorities 
#YouFiredYet?
Not to mention Small Business gets a week.  The Earth gets a day.  smh.
How about our AIR ?
It's filled with nano particulates !
Stop  ...."Weather Modification"
These are not Clouds ..............
What color is your sky ?
But all the investment side if you've got investments in stocks that have anything to do with oil Natural Gas you are happy that he's screwing this country up for the benefit of a dollar.
Bro, the only small business you’re supporting is the private jet, luxury trip, and soundproofing business. And you’re doing it on our taxes
You are only committed to increasing the wealth of the wealthy at the expense of the health of the environment and the American public.
Resign
Scottie YOU'RE on the way
 O U T..
Your career indicator light is TERMINAL..
You're killing out planet and squandering taxpayer dollars 
Your job is to protect our environment not businesses!

Tickle my tummy dadd y
I am really impressed by your throw your employees under the bus style of leadership. Inspiring!
Are you going to repay all that money that you basically wasted?
Are you going to force the past administration to do likewise
Past is the past. Didn't say I agreed with them either. Can't change the past now can we? What we can do is hold current administration accountable.
Now y’all are wanting to hold people accountable. I guess a republican is President
We wanted to before lol
You are doing a wonderful job. Thank you keep fighting.
He is doing a wonderful job at spending taxpayers money and selling American health out to corporations. Thank him when you get lung cancer
Didn’t our last administration spend tax payers money as well.
Pruitt you are doing the exact opposite of protecting human health and our environment. Hope the bribes you’re receiving is worth destroying our earth. Pitiful.
You’re in charge of protecting the environment, yet you repeatedly do nothing there. Why didn’t you just stick to business? Just to unravel all protections? Ohhhh. Got it

Icahn bailed Trump out of his casino mess and is under DoJ investigation for his role in influencing biofuels policy. This waiver enables Icahn's company to avoid tens of millions of dollars in costs related to U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a program meant to cut pollution. …
Like Carl Icahn? Resign, you hypocritical putz.
this is the man ruined the planet because Trump told him to

BEHOLD PRUITT SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES:
Billionaire Carl Icahn helped Trump vet Scott Pruitt for the EPA administrator position. How convenient!
#PollutingPruitt #FirePruitt #BootPruitt #EPA #Trump
#MondayMotivation #SmallBusinessWeek #Pruitt
The EPA director to me in my opinion is, he is so full of s*** his eyes are brown got to be Brown. If Epa does not understand clean energy is the way the future then he's a freaking idiot. We have to get special interest money and groups out of government.
How is giving a tax waiver worth millions to Carl Icahn (billionaire Trump crony from Oklahoma who’s currently under investigation for attempting to manipulate biofuel policy) supporting small business and protecting the environment?
You are committed to nothing but lining your own pocket while keeping Trump & #FossilFuels happy. You are a crook. You are despicable. #FirePruitt #BootPruitt
What utter drivel.

Name one way you have protected human health and the environment. We’ll wait...

No can do? Ok. Then list all the ongoing investigations into your ethics violations.

Oops. Not enough room here, is there?

#FirePruitt #BootPruitt #PollutingPruitt #Trump
You, Entitled Asshat need to RESIGN!!!


Resign you crook

You’re a joke.  Science exists, read a book gargamel.  Then, please, for the sake of humanity, resign.
Do you plan on regulating those small businesses or just letting them pollute at will?   You are a disaster.

Pruitt will expose all the fake science being peddled at the EPA, which is why they want him out. No more secret science! This issue demands transparency, even if the climate cultists don't want it.
Pruitt is allowing MORE POISONS in the environment as we type !

Pruitt's hatred of the environment is well known.

Pruitt allowed more lead, mercury, and toxic hydrocarbons 
into our air, land, water all over America !

He poisons US ! 

#PruittPoisonsAmerica #TrumpBadAppointees
Scott Pruitt = Corruption
The only thing you’re committed to is making it easier for your polluting buddies to poison us. Hope the $$$ you are getting is worth your descendants’ health, criminal
Scott “CLUELESS “ Pruitt!!!!!
Doubt it
RESIGN!
Oh, Scott.
I see how you added "efforts to protect human health and the environment" as an afterthought, #Liar.
#BootPruitt #FirePruitt #ImpeachPruitt
How long will you last? I'm guessing 15 days or less.
