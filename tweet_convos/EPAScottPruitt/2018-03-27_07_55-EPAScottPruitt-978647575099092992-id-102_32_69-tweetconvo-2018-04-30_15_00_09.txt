Keep winning for America
Pahleaze.  Pruitt is a hack attorney who thinks Rising CO2 and emissions are God's will. God got nothing to do with it. He needs to go!
Nobody said God but common sense makes sense try consuming less #Fakenews
Pruitt: Bible says 'harvest the natural resources' | TheHill
http://thehill.com  › energy-environment

This idiot needs to take his biblical views out of this office.  The EPA was developed by sound decisions based on science not religion.  Plus he has no science background.
I’m not an evangelical I’m a capitalist
It’s only a problem if you have screwed up ideology maybe you will blow yourself up and yell Obama  Akbar make sure it’s being recorded at CNN they need ratings they’re ranked last
Just as I thought your bigoted arrogance is what drives you. Just like Trump and Pruitt. You should go buy some Land Texas and call it the Branch Davidian compound. But that's what I would expect from a small handed president - small minds like yours bye-bye blocked
Don't make me laugh! "Power is restored to the states"--- except for California, which must abide by federal mandates to increase CO2 emissions?  You've got a hypocrisy problem here!
Huh, I'd have thought the core mission of the Environmental Protection Agency would be protecting the environment, not promoting neoconfederacy.  Who'd have guessed?

I’d rather have clean drinking water, clean air to breath and not see my home underwater from rising sea levels.
Mr. Pruitt great job so far!  Please HELP the rank and file EPA & Corps of Engineers are ignoring @POTUS @realDonaldTrump executive order on Waters of the United States jurisdiction.
How much destruction will Pruitt cause before we end this nightmare?

#BREAKING: Trump EPA to shut down office handling research on chemicals' effects on children's health http://hill.cm/8Vd58qR  
I didn't realize that "destroy the environment" is the core mission of the Environmental Protection Agency.
You’ve been misled by RadicalizedLiberalism and #Fakenews
Please stop the pollution from coal. Why go backwards? Only to save $$ at the expense of our health.
EPA's core mission is to "protect human health and the environment." That's it. Not "restore states' rights". Not "roll back regulations to make businesses happier." You are failing the core mission of your agency Scott.
And how much have you spent on personal security, travel, and even promoting a personal friend's energy program overseas while living at his house?
That is not the mission of @EPA nor has it ever been @EPAScottPruitt ! Stop lying! You are changing it into what you want it to be because you’re against EPA! You are supposed to be protecting our environment & making wise decisions for our health & the health of our environment.
Great strides in harming the environment that is the opposite of the core http://mission.how  much have you made in bribes so far.

Letting corporate polluters pollute with impunity, that’s not progress.
Do'in a helluva job Pruitt!
The @gop is for big business, run by big business, and could CARE LESS about regular people, this is not #MAGA or #Conservative, its disgusting! #NeverEverTrustaRepublican (again) #gop …
So cool that you're into restoring power to the states and you support allowing California and other states to set stricter environmental standards than the ones you and your pro-business flunkies come up with.
Yes, but you've failed in your highest mandate: working to serve the public and preserve the environment for us and generations to come.  #climatechange #RenewableEnergy #BlueWave2018
Core mission is to protect the environment, not sell cars.

Thank you for not destroying Biscane Bay.
So... your core mission is to cheap out on protecting the environment? Say stuff is good that isn’t? Except for mr. Pruitt’s vices... that’s always good cuz money now, future can take care of itself
#BootPruitt He's bout that paper, not protecting the one environment we have.
Bullshit!
Pruitt and Zinke should be very concerned, as there is no one left for them to hide behind. #BootPruitt
Ok, so how many cabinet firings have there been?

Price
Tillerson…
Thank you for all your hard work. Appreciate your decision to stop writing regulations based on “secret science” which frankly reeks of skullduggery! Scientific data must be available to the public or unscrupulous bureaucrats will promote own pet projects.
@Aungiexyz "science doesn't care what you believe."  18 months ago I could go on the @EPA website and find the data I needed to do my job. Now it's scrubbed clean. Wake up!
Complete BS!
Core mission is to protect the environment. This is not about promoting business. If that's your idea then you are not at all qualified for this position.
Restore power to the states?  Then why are you taking away California's right to set it's own standards?  CORRUPT!
You should realize the core mission of the epa is to PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT! Not to develop fossil fuels. Those two are at direct odds to each other.
Is this how you restore power back to the states? Not everyone has the same backwards views as @EPAScottPruitt
You are doing everything in your power to dismantle the agency you are in charge of. You are nothing but a greedy corporate fossil fuel shill ENOUGH.
You are supposed to be protecting our environment not polluting it or destroying it! Amazing how before you ever became involved (thanks tons @realDonaldTrump for such a stupid decision) @EPA knew what they were doing & doing a good job but now you are ruining it! You’re awful!
Maybe the EPA will get NY & especially Pennsylvania to controll their pollution of the Susquehanna that severely pollutes the Chesapeake Bay

Hey Pruitt! Actually, that is NOT your mission! Check out your own website. https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do … #WakeUpAmerica #PollutingPruitt
.@EPA The EPA’s ‘core mission’ is to protect the environment, in case you forgot. Science should dictate policy, but policy should NEVER dictate science.
Please repeal the expensive, car-price-increasing, freedom-restricting CAFE regulations, and repeal the requirements for DEF and DPF in big trucks, end the commies in CA known as CARB for our hard-working truck drivers!
Have looked at how much more we are polluting the world than we were only two years ago?

Dismantling all regulations that protect the environment is not progress.
Please stop plagarizing George Orwell. It’s 2018, not 1984
On the linked page, you discuss shifts in regulatory approaches rather than advances that produce a positive impact on human health. One can argue that your proposed actions, in the absence of solid state regulatory policies to fill the void, do the opposite. Peer review anyone?
Please, for all our sakes, continue posting about environmental education and the health effects of PM air pollution, not these politically-influenced, science-devoid messages. @EPA
Your job is to protect human health and the environment. Pruitt is a disgrace.
BS.  I say this based on over 45 years working as an environmental scientist, starting soon after EPA started. We have made huge improvements in air and water quality, with enormous benefits to human health, at very reasonable cost. You are taking us backward, to our detriment.
Your core mission is protecting the environment, not making life easy for polluting companies, which is all Pruitt wants to do. He belongs in jail
Your core mission is to protect the Environment.
STOP THE CHEMTRAILS
FAKE NEWS
This isn’t the REAL EPA - you know, the one that protects human health and the environment we live in. Whoever posted this will be unemployed by the next administration...
Still work left to do? 
From the sound of it, @EPAScottPruitt is DONE protecting the environment...
#SaveTheEPA #ScienceMatters #ClimateChangeIsReal
Pruitt is the worst. Even worse than Pres. Dennison. I can't believe we are paying for this shithead to put everyone's health, and the health of the environment, in danger.

"progress"
Ha.
How many lies can fit into 280 characters? Shame on the EPA for abandoning the task of protecting the environment and selling out to mining and industry.
#PublicEnemy @ScottPruittOK refocus the Agency. NO POWER OF RESTRICTION. This men dont believe CLIMATE CHANGE is real. Sadly is more difficult to make restriction in place than removing them.
You don’t even believe science or understand climate, you say climate change isn’t happening because it is cold some places. We’re onto your lies
I'm very concerned that you either don't understand the meaning of "core mission" or perhaps "environmental protection." I'll try to just imagine that either you view this as a giant ironic joke...or you've had a lobotomy.
. Ahh spin it like it is.... restore power means roll back regulations protecting each of us from corporate greed and pollution.  Pretty sad when you really dog into what you are doing.
You most certainly have not. Again, your mission is "to protect human health and the environment." Denying climate change & refusing to use research findings to inform public policy in no way supports that mission. #EPA @EPA @EPAScottPruitt #ScienceNotSilence #ClimateChangeIsReal
The Environmental DESTRUCTION Agency... has been regrettably successful . #FireScottPruitt
This EPA statement does not mention anything about PROTECTING the ENVIRONMENT. You rolled back regs and you ban the phrase “climate change”. Worse, you’ve abandoned the scientific method. Pruitt has to go.
Giving “pollution power” back to the states is such a great idea. All the scientists say pollution doesn’t migrate in the water and air, right? 

Wrong.  It does and no scientists have told you otherwise since you consult lobbyists for EPA policy, not scientists.
Yeah, also now the world can see that @EPAScottPruitt is SERIOUSLY willing to threaten the well-being of everyone on the planet for his own personal financial gain. So congrats!!!
You haven't done diddly squat under @EPAScottPruitt but undermine the core mission, which is to protect human health and environment.
Aren't these regulatory burdens on your financial cronies? Remember, you work for us, not the energy industry. It is simple. Without clean air we cannot survive. It is not an expendable resource. Do your job and protect our environment.
The ‘core mission’ for Scotty and his band of scientific illiterates is to pave the way for industry to do whatever they feel the need to do to increase profits; the environment and human health have no place in the equation.
Hooray!!
Scott Pruitt’s Dirty Politics
The strides you claim appear to be in rolling back protections for our environment. In addition, since when is it appropriate to spend pages and pages of a government report quoting media that is sympathetic to your mission to defund rather than defend environmental protections?
The 'agency processes' that approve phone booths and first class flights sure as hell have been streamlined.
Mostly to the detriment of public health.
The EPA has taken at least 15 major actions on air pollution since Pruitt took over the agency — all opposed by leading public health groups. http://bit.ly/2FSozwA 
Oh, that’s how you want to spin it?
Who thought the EPA would betray Americans & become the largest polluter in history!
And here I thought the E&P in EPA stood for Environmental Protection

Pretty sure that isn't the agenda of the EPA at the moment...

How is stealing our money and killing us the EPA's core mission? HHS and Dept of the Interior are working on that as well. Too much overlap!
<cough> calling bullsh*t
April fools day isn’t until Sunday
We are aware and coming after your do-nothing policy of letting the Codex Alimentarius think for you.  Get your resumes ready, punks.
EPA, taking the side of the polluters since 2017
#ClimateChangeIsReal  #ShameOnYou  #Traitor
do not tamper with California's right to cleaner cars and cleaner air.
.@EPAScottPruitt says he wants to "restore power to the states," (a ridiculous notion considering that pollution crosses state lines) but seeks to prevent California from having strict anti-pollution regulations. 
#ImpeachPruitt
Seriously, @EPA, blink twice if you need help.
Just save the propaganda. Nobody is buying it.
You've done more damage than any 5 administrations put together
