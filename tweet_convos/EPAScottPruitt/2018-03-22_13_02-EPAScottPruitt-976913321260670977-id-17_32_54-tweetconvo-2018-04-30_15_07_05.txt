Why is @EPAScottPruitt, hater of all things environmental, head of the @EPA? He cares not for water quality, air quality, or soil quality #climatechange #WorldWaterDay #TheresAFoxInTheChickenCoop #SaveWater #sustainability #PruittIsTheWrongAnswer
Just because he’s realistic doesn’t mean he cares less than you.  We need a happy medium between conservation and regulation.  We’re drowning in our own red tape.
Tell me how selling off public land to big oil helps you, me, or conservationism. Or how investing in oil rather than alternative sources of energy is better for the environment. I’ll wait
The 'for years to come' part obviously means @EPAScottPruitt financing today with the blood of our heirs. #pollutingPruitt
Clean water and @EPAScottPruitt is a oxymoron. #pollutingPruitt  ing regs so big business can destroy natural resources.
Shame that you don't care what chemicals are pumped into it by large-scale polluters... err... I mean donors.
I encourage everyone to simply google search @EPAScottPruitt & #CleanWaterAct... They are putting the lives & health of all U.S. citizens at risk. How can you not #doyourjob? 
#unAmerican #WorldWaterDay
Yes and with your new regulations you can now poison more American children.  You should be so proud how money is held higher than our own children.  You all should be ashamed of what you are doing, just disgusting!
Are there really so few professionals at EPA who will refuse to cooperate with a Secretary who is a corrupt science-denier?
Liars
Then stop repealing regulations that allow companies to frack and pollute water systems.  #climatechange #BlueWave2018 #RenewableEnergy
So stop removing regulations that protect water. It's literally that easy.
Yep, do let’s lift regulations that protect it from big corporations who pollute.

@EPAScottPruitt You’ve got some nerve
