You idiot, regulatory certainty is not allowing Big Ag to freely dump pesticides, fertilizers, and effluent into our waters. You are a criminal destroying our country for personal gain
You are so far off the mark...
Can’t argue with this non statement. Typical MAGAtt, no facts
Plenty of facts. But you keep believing that...
You deny scientific fact.
You deny climate change.
You facilitate carbon pollution.
WOTUS regulations are minuscule compared to the damage you are doing to the agriculture industry and food security for the entire nation.
You were in GA and didn't tell me??  Man, I wish you'd publish your super duper secret schedule!  This GA farmgirl living on well water would GLADLY have come and given my input on your BS #WOTUS "rewrite".

Climate change is tough, but @nytimes has answers: http://nyti.ms/2kF6uI7  // Excellent Q+A compilation by @JustinHGillis 
With that “rewrite” of the Clean Water Rule, @EPAScottPruitt is delivering farmers only years more of legal UNcertainty.  Brilliant!
I love Mr Pruitt’s regulatory certainty http://line.like  low tar cigarettes, clean coal, just a little tipsy... sigh.. rewrite means let’s roll back and cxl clean water requirements and let people do pretty much whatever as long as they make $.  35 months 35 months 35 ....
Holy Shit! It’s #NationalAgWeek. Is this the week you brag about allowing big companies dump big poisons wherever they choose even if it’s getting into the ground water and killing crops and live stock? Just making sure we’re on the same page.




As the former public affairs chief for two federal agencies (in two GOP administrations), I can tell you that this is an INSANE amount of money for any federal agency head to spend on travel and security measures. Off the charts. https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/976228540906655745 …

New documents show nearly $68,000 in recent premium flights, hotel stays for EPA’s Pruitt. #DrainTheSwamp #BigBoyPantsTime
How about certainty that we will have clean air and water? That climate change will not cause catastrophic weather events? Stop business networking and do your job.
We had ‘regulatory certainty’; it just didn’t fit in with your payola plans Scotty.
The WOTUS debacle is being perpetrated by Pruitt & Trump’s Admin and their large land developers, maga farms & industrial donors complaining about responsible developmental constraints on their activities. Their concerns are devoid of enviro-responsibility, it’s about making $$!
2) Than Pruitt/Trump portray WOTUS as the battle of small family farmers victimized by Washington. WOTUS isn’t about seasonal creeks & ditches!This is their excuse. WOTUS protects our wet lands, prairie pools, tidal estuaries, dry river beds from exploitation.
How large of a Security Detail did you need for this? 50? Did they all fly first class, too? That Italy trip was a bust for the taxpayers. IG time!
So it’s ok for them to put dangerous chemicals in our water?
Hey Scott!  Why don’t you go sniff a can of unregulated paint, drink the water runoff from fracking farms and then take a shot of roundup!  #naturelover #ClimateChangeIsReal #protectnature #resign #unfit

#WhatPruittSaid
"I only drink bottled water, shipped in by coal-fueled freighters under heavy guard at taxpayer expense."

#WhatPruittSaid
"Why doesn't anyone like me?"

#WhatPruittSaid
"The EPA no longer believes that clean water is necessary to sustain life or to grow healthy crops. Pollute away!"

#WhatPruittSaid
"The EPA is eliminating the rules that ensure that farmers behave ethically and don't cut corners to maximize profits. We trust you."

"regulatory certainty" - define that, Scott.
Your job is to protect the environment, not your wealthy friends.
Keep America -- citizens and environment HEALTHY!
Putting the health of Americans at risk.
