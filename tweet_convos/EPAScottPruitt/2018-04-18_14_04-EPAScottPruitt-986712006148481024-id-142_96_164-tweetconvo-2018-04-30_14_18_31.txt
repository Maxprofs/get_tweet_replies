2018 report on GHG emissions confirms @POTUS critics are wrong againtop-down regs like CPP or misguided int’l agreements like Paris Accord aren’t the solution. American ingenuity & tech breakthroughs have made US the world leader in energy dominance while reducing emissions.
Yay, us! That is indeed good news, and the direct result of strict regulation and participation in global climate agreements, ALL. OF. WHICH. YOU'RE. UNDOING. 
#Stoppit
Are you aware just how much the fine people of our nation dislike you?
Thanks Obama!!!!
So you agree that reducing CO2 is both a good and necessary goal?
Stop taking credit for the previous work of the agency you are now destroying.
You’re stealing our tax dollars for personal luxury. #crook

When you leave they'll need to designate your office as a Superfund site.

Persecution mania mixed with delusions of grandeur make a very toxic mix.
None of which happened due to your actions. You trumpet this achievement while you sell out the country for a few pieces of silver. Fuck you asswipe.
NO THANKS TO YOU! GET OUT!
The Pruitt EPA has wasted taxpayer funds more than any Federal Department on Earth over the last year. @EPA records highlight continued waste, above 2015 levels and above 2005 levels.
How do you still have a job @EPAScottPruitt? You're as corrupt as F and are not protecting the environment.
RESIGN
Liar boot pruitt
Guess the Obama Administration was really on to something then, huh @EPAScottPruitt?
Resign!  Resign!!
Because of coal plant closures and better vehicle mileage.  Which your team and your boss are trying to undo.
Yes, because we used all the tools that you’re now getting rid of, Scott. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
Yes over the last decade things improved something that you had no part in and are working to undo... you need to go...
#FirePruitt
#Liar #FirePruitt #BootPruitt #FirePruittNow. 39 senators & 131 representatives are asking you to resign or be fired. Make things easy on yourself: #ResignNow.
And now you want to reverse that. You're a crook.
How close are we to meeting the benchmark of reducing CO2 emissions 80% below 1990 levels? Not close at all. U.S. needs to do much more to reduce heat trapping emissions - a lesson both political parties need to learn https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014 …
Here is the updated data - still nowhere near the 80 percent below 1990 emission levels benchmark https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks … Do your job #PollutingPruitt
Actually, one of the big reasons behind the GHG reductions is the strong #cleanercars standards that cut oil use. The ones that you’re trying to roll back – let us jog your memory:
And we have confidence that you will reverse the trend with your obscene actions. Resign now, criminal

President Trump’s budget cuts could doom nearly 200 Hawaiian plant species to rapid extinction, conservationists warn. http://bit.ly/2JUgEx4  
CPP wasn't top down. States could create their own plans based on their preferred policies and unique circumstances. Just like the original CAA and again with the CAA amendments, cost of compliance would likely have been lower than anticipated and the health benefits larger.

You had absolutely nothing to do with that.  Resign.
Thank you President Obama.
So why rollback fuel efficiency standards which made this possible?
RESIGN.
What a hypocritical statement! How can you brag about reducing CO2 levels while doing your damnedest to eliminate all the controls and regulations that allowed the reductions in the first place?
What?You’re own report states you are wrong.Between 2005 and 2016 a 25% drop.2016/2017 a 2% drop.  Still a drop but slowed down and the effects of your rollbacks and new production, lower MPG standards won’t be felt till 2019.  You are SO dishonest. @Fight4Goodness @billmckibben
Do you know why that is?

YOU WERE NOT HEAD OF THE EPA.

President Trump’s budget cuts could doom nearly 200 Hawaiian plant species to rapid extinction, conservationists warn. http://bit.ly/2JUgEx4  
And yet you’re rolling back requirements on mileage and efficiency.
Until you get through with it, eh.
RESIGN
Seems like every day another story breaks on how awesomely corrupt #PollutingPruitt is. Thank you so much @realDonaldTrump for keeping swamp monster @EPAScottPruitt in your #CabinetOfCorruption. Helps Dems in Nov! Can you please have him show up at one of your unhinge…
#RESIGN
What Americans really deserve is an EPA Administrator that will protect their right to breathe clean air and drink clean water, but at the very least they should have one that isn't corrupt. Pruitt should resign.
Damn, you have done so much good for this country... Future generations will be praising your name... #BootPruitt #PollutingPruitt
Exactly WHY are you even still in the WH?? OHHH, that’s right-Bc YOU’RE JUST AS CORRUPT AS THE DUNDERHEADED TWATWAFFLE YOU SERVE. Plus-you’re also a coward. “I have to fly 1st class-ppl BULLY ME”#Wussyman
And you are working your best to reverse that trend!
@EPAScottPruitt you are a monster! What’s it like knowing that everyone in America hates you?
131 representatives and 39 senators signed a resolution that calls for Scott Pruitt to resign. The resolution states they have "no confidence" in the Administrator. The resolution attracted the most senators to ever sign a resolution calling for a Cabinet official’s ouster.
No thanks to you
No thanks to #gargamel Pruitt
Your legacy is as sad as your aptitude to lead. It saddens me what you’re doing to the planet your kids will inherit #failedman #PruittMustResign
Scott Pruitt you need to understand that A decade is 10 years. Barack Obama was President for 8 of that 10 that you claim in a decade. Thank you for recognizing that Obama created laws for these reductions and they were working before you came along to destroy it over the next 2!
Lying paranoid @EPAScottPruitt get out of our #EPA
#FirePruitt #Resign #PollutingPruitt #BootPruitt #PruittIsKillingUs #ColludingPruitt #ScottPruittCorrupt

No thanks to you.
Progress on emission reductions to date is pathetic. The time frame in this report ended before the Trump Administration, which is trying to undo what little progress has been made.
RESIGN!
This annual report includes data up to 2016, before you were even there, moron!  Look at the data and have a scientist interpret it for you.  The latest drops GHG emissions are due to the OBAMA Administration!  #ThanksObama #FirePruitt #BootPruitt
Yes it is, thank you for that obama!
Then why are you doing everything you can to ruin the atmosphere? #resign
Scott...dont be to hard on yourself.
If we give you just a little more time we know youll be able to reverse this trend.
Thank you President Obama.
Thank you obama
Thanks Obama.
Check your phone booth.
Let's see how quickly your proposed policies will get this turned around!!
#ThursdayThoughts why is @EPAScottPruitt still in office
Corruption to the bone.
F'ing liar, China is the leader in reduction and efforts to get rid of coal and move to electric transportation. Citizens can't trust Pruitt

Great Job Obama and the Dems! F u Pruitt!
So then why do you insist on removing the laws put in place to make this happen? Do you really believe in putting emotion over scientific fact? Did you even go to school as a kid, you are one of the dumbest people i have ever seen in office and it is a disgrace
And your determined to reverse all of the progress made under previous admins bc you're in the pocket of #FossilFuel 
No one believes you, you nihilist thief.
Absolutely none of the reductions are due to you or the EPA you preside over. You are destroying the EPA. You are a major burden on the American environment. You are responsible for pollution going on in our air, land & water right now. You are the worst EPA Director EVER. Resign
Time to RESIGN you CORRUPT LIAR/Thief.  GO HOME TO TULSA and work for your masters Oil&Gas, because you are the FOX in the HENhouse and NOT wanted by most of the country.  EVEN Republicans hate your BIG SPENDING!
Sir you are as bad as James Watt was in this job. That’s saying something
No.
How are the 9 investigations about your unethical spending going with the IG? #ClimateAction #criminal
It’s curious you’re boasting about the result of efforts begun by @EPA decades ago, yet you’ve been rolling back said efforts since the day you started... A decade from now, will you also take credit for the mess you’ve created? 

Idiot.
That is must be terrible news for you, Scott.  You are working hard to reverse the reduction of green house gases by removing the regulations that made it happen.  The tragic tenure of Scott Pruitt will live in infamy.
Dude. Stop being a total fuckwit.
Because, you care.
I guess that sterling record will be ending this year.
Honey did you eat paint chip? You know you are good as gone right?
Thanks, Obama! Too bad that grifting creep, Pruitt is trying to remove all the regulations that got us these positive results.
But, following your own logic, perhaps, then you would agree that it wouldn't have "hurt" to be a part of the Paris accord?
Your pants are on fire 
That is completely untrue in the last year we have reversed what we gained
THANKS @BarackObama
Each of us Americans still spews out almost 8 times that of a German and 16 times more than a Chinese citizen. Not good enough.
What does reducing emissions matter if you don't believe in global warming?
You expect us to believe a report from your EPA? No way, Pollutin' Pruitt!
You are f*cking up our environment
Maybe before you got to the EPA and screwed everything up.
Thank you Obama
These reductions were not your doing. What you are doing is trying to reverse the policies that reduced them. You cannot claim what you do not work to protect. You are a disgrace. Resign.
No thanks to you turd.....you’ve been too busy hiding in your illegally funded “booth of silence”.....
Switching completely to job-creating renewable energy will drive those greenhouse gas reductions even faster!
Thanks for making this happen for us Scotty.  Whoops,,,these are results from BEFORE you got there aren’t they.
In that case, thanks for telling us how great it was going BEFORE you got there.
And you want to change it by relaxing regulation on clean air standards.
Yes it is becisse of regulations you are getting rid of. How is that fancy new car?
Keep in mind all the security precautions you’ve erected for yourself (@ taxpayers’ expense) due to your paranoia - inflamed by your guilty conscience - will no longer be at your disposal when you are shitcanned.

You’ll then be a naked target for the wrath you’ve earned forever.
Scott, you have too back COLSTRIP Montana.  Largest coal power plants site in USA. CLEAN AND EFFICIENT. Save thousands of good jobs at mines and plants before they are scheduled too shut down.
Liar
So did write this in your sound proof corruption booth?
That’s why you are relaxing the laws?
PRUITT IS A CORRUPT PIECE OF CRAP!
Correct and most of this success was accomplished by President Obama! RESIGN DUFUS!
Why does incompetent unqualified and unethical Scott Pruitt still head the EPA?  He's an embarrassment he should resign or be fired @tedlieu @RWPUSA @RepSwalwell @SenSchumer @KamalaHarris
Stricter regulations helped the reduction of emissions, which you're vehemently against
#FirePruitt #Grifter @POTUS
@POTUS  Lying, cheating, spendthrift --- Can you resign?

"New study spotlights biggest Pruitt scandal — every polluted breath our kids take" http://hill.cm/kWsHXSM  
Environmentalists are the most angry, irrational mob I've ever witnessed. "Give EPA all of the regulatory power, none of the congressional oversight and never be skeptical of them, else you get the Scott Pruitt treatment" is their stance. Checks and balances are important, guys.
In case you and your your safety entourage need a reason to fly first class to NY on our dime, try attending this:
You will go down in history not only as the worst EPA Admin,  but most corrupt cabinet member ever. You think you are some VIP worthy of motorcades and really are just a little lapdog for corporate polluters.
No thanks to you!!! How stupid do you think we are?
The US has reduced these gas emissions because of regulations over the last 10 years(decade). You've only been in EPA for how long? You are in the process of reversing progress while claiming progress is because of you? Your actions will destroy the last 10 years of progress. 
That's because most of your rollbacks haven't taken effect yet, ya moron. The regulations implemented in the past decade, along with tax breaks for low emission/clean energy development are what did that, not you or the current @EPA. 
You can't take credit for reduced GHG emissions that occurred due to policies the previous administration implemented. Everything you and POTUS are trying to do now will UNDO the advances made in the past decade. Are you seriously that thick?
Innovation drives decarbonization!
But that's not good enough for the climate change racketeers. We must have MORE programs, MORE money, MORE solyndra's. After all, you can't expect them to get a real job, do ya'?
So let's go back to coal! 
And no amount of reduction by the US will have any measurable impact on global atmospheric GHG growth.
You are irreparably harming America and the global environment and you are literally stealing money from hard working Americans to pay for your extravagant travel and soundproof box.  You are horrid and will go down.
