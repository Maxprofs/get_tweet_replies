Your vision for our water includes coal ash. Why do you want to give cancer to people? Oh, that’s right,  your coal ash polluting buddies give $$ to your campaigns. You are a killer.

39 senators and 131 representatives are calling on you to resign. This is the most Senators in U.S. history to sign on to a resolution formally calling for a cabinet official’s resignation.
 
The bottom line: Pruitt is corrupt. He must go.
Thank you for caring so much about our environment.  Keep up the good work!  (Until you leave, lol.)
Resign.

Please resign immediately.
Quit. We are done having you waste our money, Mr. Corruption.
1) POTUS has no vision for the country.
2) We had strict environmental protections during the amazing economic growth of the past decade
3) You're #CorruptToTheCore & #UnfitForOffice
4) #Resign

There are no environmental protections under your leadership . Really . Let us know what you have done to protect the environment . You  have done plenty for yourself since taking that position . Just another Trump flunkie . Making the swamp bigger ..
In honor of Eath day, please resign. Your rollbacks, and promotion of corporations over constituents, make the world worse.
Must leave. You're doing our country no good. You're spending taxpayer dollars on high big money trips and not helping anything, you must resign.
@realDonaldTrump does not have a vision for anything but his own self promotion and glorification. The earth 
and it’s flora and fauna could rot away, but as long as he
has his gold bathroom throne and his phone, he could care less. You and your oily corporate comrades? Same.
Is this a joke? You are NOT protecting our waterways.
.You are the epitome of corruption. Resign now to save the environment and the American people.
I don’t trust ANYTHING you do!

Wierd.
resign
Can't wait to see you hauled off to jail.
Yeah... The only way this is “POTUS’ vision” is if it involves a wet T-shirt contest!
Resign.
Sounds like someone just got waterfront property in King Co, WA.


Pruitt said the lobbyist whose home he was living in did not lobby the EPA. A new filing says he did. The lobbyist, Steve Hart, resigned from his firm yesterday -  https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/20/pruitt-condo-lobbyist-leaving-firm-543508 …
You should resign.

Dear @EPAScottPruitt: Since you waste taxpayer dollars on first class travel for you & your staff, you don't know what you are missing out on. I flew @SouthwestAir today & got two Belvita cranberry orange biscuits. They're…

How come your pal lost his job, but you still have yours?
U belong in jail!.

PRIVATIZING it ain't gonna improve it. Quite the contrary - as with anything that's privatized.

Is this company affiliated with the Gold King Mine in Colorado that apparently is the site of a toxic waste site?
Interesting if this mining co. In Colorado is afiliated with King co. In Washington state that just got 134million for a cleanup site.......just asking?

Leave office and stop wasting our money. You’re the real hazard to the environment.
RESIGN you bum! You are ripping the taxpayer off with your unprecedented perks and are injuring environmental health and safety. That aside you lack technical competence that 10s of thousands other have for the job. Get out!
