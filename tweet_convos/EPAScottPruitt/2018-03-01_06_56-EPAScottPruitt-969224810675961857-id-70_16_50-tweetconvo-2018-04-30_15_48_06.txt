THIS IS WHAT POLLUTION LOOKS LIKE #POLLUTINGPRUITT
Regulatory relief is simply a means of shifting costs from polluters to victims of pollution.

If you really believed in the free market, you would support policies that internalize externalities.
Again ,you sold the America environment to fossil energy industries, that makes the America polluted again. We need renewable energy,we need sustainability’s future.#ClimateChangeIsReal  #ShameOnYou  #RenewableEnergy  #ChangeIsComing  #VoteGOPOut  #FlipItBlue #GOTV
He is #Gargamel
Did you fly there first class?
#gargamel always flies first class

You're destroying the environment!
Scott Pruitt is #gargamel
Oh shit, I just noticed...pic came out this morning, he meeting was yesterday...yep, that's Scott Pruitt's "me and my black friend" selfie for black history month.
While your doing regulatory relief should sever TSCA and SDWA, as TSCA is ill suited to them management of SDWA. It actually limits the protective action and creates undue burdens
Another day, more selfies.
It seems #Gargamel will begin his water assault on the poor helpless Smurfs.  Their village will be washed from the forest if he has his way. How could the Smurfs possibly prevent a monster such as Gargamel, all they can do is attempt to trick him, he is of course, famously dense
You are f*ing up our environment.  Travel by cheapest method. You work for us
Scott pruitt works to destroy the Smurfs, he is #Gargamel
You've probably never heard of WOTUS but it could have serious drinking water implications |

1) @EPAScottPruitt is intentionally putting our families health and lives in danger is criminal.  People went to jail in Flint water crisis. Scott Pruitt sinister agenda is much worse he should be charged with murder for dumping toxic chemicals in
Joke




Fake EPA
What are your actual qualifications? I'll wait.
Lack rules with certainty of no enforcement!  Let the pollution begin!
Regulatory relief? Like how many corners can we cut that diminish safety and increase profits? Got it, business as usual.
Overhaul or Sell Off Mr Magoo?

#PoisonousPruitt
Does this mean we'll be getting everyone CLEAN water? Guaranteed?
Why the hell is a person who doesn't believe in evolution/science making critical universal scientific decisions about our water?
Who are you kidding our water is not safe to drink our air is not fit to breathe and or food is not fit to eat 
I hope you choke on a chicken bone
Scott Pruitt = gargamel.  That’s funny and true
Did you have to tweet his from slum class? Hope you’re hanging in there mixing with all the common folk.
If consumer protections suffer on behalf of business relief. You are not doing your job! #RegulationEqualsConsumerProtection
Scott Pruitt, flying high on the taxpayer’s dime
Mix a little oil with it from broken pipelines
Hey Scott Pruitt, do the ecologically minded thing: make like a tree, and leave.
Scotty boy will be out soon enough. His legacy will be pollution and industry over the environment. His children will be ashamed and embarrassed.
Oh? How about the office that studies how chemicals impact children? Oh, that's right, you shut it down. What the actual hell is wrong with you? Enjoy flying coach, you deserve every miserable moment of it.
Regulatory relief ... semantics as in, “ you can do what you want no consequences” sad sad
Pruitt, we’re not stupid. We know that regulatory relief is so businesses can pollute as much as they want. I’d fire you for dereliction of duty if I could you do work for us. Why do you hate the USA?
Welcome to coach
Appearances are all that voting public has & you appear to be in pocket of big-industry which is why you communicate w/them via a private phone booth paid w/ tax dollars & why you travel in private planes bcuz you cant respond to questions that arent scripted by big-industry.
Hope those talks about #infrastructure included you talking about sea level change, bro. Otherwise you're just throwing money in to the ocean
God told me you spend too much on airline tickets and soundproof phone booths
It is abundently evident that you have zero interest in protecting our water.  Steps have  already been taken to allow companies like Dow Chemical to again start dumping their toxic waste into our rivers and streams.
A good way to improve water safety and infrastructure would be to INCREASE regulations on businesses involved with them, which are literally paid to do the work. All jobs have rules, and the @EPA's rules protect us. Pruitt's perspective is backward.
#ImpeachPruitt
I think you mean ways in which nestle can get more water and sell it back to us -rather than regulating clean water for the population. 
you are one sick bastard !   @EPAScottPruitt
You’re beyond corrupt. Shame on you and your greed-filled soul. #PruittShame 
Hopefully you understand that there is a world-wide water crisis and that water is life.

REGULATORY RELIEF TO BUSINESSES IS NOT YOUR JOB you greedy, science denying villain!!! How bout NOT  abolishing the #CleanWaterAct?
So does this imply you’ve fixed Flint’s water supply? Or are you just going to let those people be poisoned in the name of bullshit “regulatory relief”? Resign now- you are a criminal
You mean polluting our water?
Is it #PruittAir or #AirPruitt? LOL 
resign
While a divided America watches Trump unravel, Pruitt quietly marches to roll back measures meant to protect our fragile environment for the sake of pleasing his friends in the oil industry. Pruitt will be financially rewarded by his oil pals when this is over.
You're in the business of protecting the environment, not protecting business
Perhaps stop poisoning it AND us? #GeoEngineering #Chemtrails #Genocide @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @TrishaDishes @Chucksteak45th @Masschemtrails @ImperatorTruth @PamJonesLiberty @OpChemtrails @SteerMark @LionelMedia @RealGeoEngWatch
Hi Baylee.....are you a real person? Because your Twitter bio is legit nonsense and I would hope you're a bot (wine glass emoji)
FOCUS Pruitt!!! Clean Water Act!!! Do your job!
REGULATORY RELIEF = polluted water, unclean air and selling off our future to the highest bidder.
Resign. You are complicit with 45 and a nightmare for both the country and the planet.
Did you discuss a new bedroom set for Ben Carson as well?

Did you discuss new ways to fly first class?
You’re doing great work Mr Pruitt!
So you apparently don't understand how this applies ...
I’m continually amazed at the level of trust liberals/democrats have in government.  Especially when there is a mountain of evidence that throughout world history, government corruption is the norm. It defies logic!!
Meaning?
Exactly. Go cuddle your maga hat and enjoy your polluted water.
Exactly.  So Intellectually shallow, you can’t even explain your own opinion.
Thank you so much Scott!
