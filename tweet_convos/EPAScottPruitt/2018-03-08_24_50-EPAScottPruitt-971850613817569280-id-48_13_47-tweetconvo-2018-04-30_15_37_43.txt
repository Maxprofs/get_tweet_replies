Please stop Memphis from dumping raw sewage into the Mississippi River.
What did you discuss? Rolling back more regulations that protect our planet? Do you still think climate change is good?
Re-Open the EPA Office that researches the effects of chemicals on children’s health

.@EPAScottPruitt disavows science and public opinion, kowtows to corporate lobbyists. Deregulation shift costs from businesses onto workers, families, communities, the future. Waste dumped in streams flows downhill to other Americans. WOTUS fairly requires taking responsibility
Where all your body guards were paying for you little bit*h
You've claimed you want to share your calendar with public, but blamed "security component" (https://goo.gl/cTMqkP ), while tweeting about some meetings in real time. Hard to figure. Can't you do better than an uninformative 3-week-old online calendar?
Did you fly them in first class on our dime? Did they see the soundproof booth we bought you? Your unnecessary security detail we pay for?


WTF is cooperative federalism except a cover for rolling back needed restrictions on polluters? You’re a criminal causing immense damage to America
Saying the same lie over and over doesn’t make it true.



Great work #ScottPruitt of properly rewriting the toxic Kenyan's damaging faux-environmental, overreaching, #econut policies. It's good to see #CommonSense in action again. You are a true professional and #steward of our environment.
Either a bot
Haha, #lowinfo #Libtards; you have no skill to manage an argument. The adults have taken over; Let's keep it that way.
The careless #Libtards have been destroying the environment and the economy in tandem. Only a #Conservative government has the intelligence, rationality  and wherewithal to bring true #conservation and #sustainability to the #ecosystem; because it is they who truly care.


Judge agrees with AG Ferguson that EPA violated the Clean Air Act by delaying air quality standards for ground-level ozone pollution – another successful outcome in a case that has not yet resolved. Ruling: http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/2018%2003%2012%20Order%20Granting%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf … Case background: …
No suprise here. All white and mostly male, doing a job they dont even seem to believe in: #climatechange #ClimateBeen to Flint yet, or in Dakota a.o. places where oil is more important than our environment. From leaking pipes to toxic gass from fracking. Ask the natives abt this
Why is Memphis being allowed to dump raw sewage into the Mississippi River?
Pruitt, on the Evolutionary ladder you are lower than whale shit and that is at the bottom of the ocean!  Just saying for a friend. #VoteWithVengeance #ClimateDay2018 #VoteThemOut #NeverAgain
A detestable shill for corporate polluters dirty fossil fuel and mining companies should not be heading the EPA #RemoveKochTool
Did you all discuss what it will be like to be held responsible for the destruction of the planet for the rest of your lives? I hope you twist your knee while playing golf or racquetball or whatever other white-supremacist shit you play. #resign
Scotty is almost as stupid as rump is. Corporate shill.
How many are Hydrologists? Fluvial Geomorphologists? Hydrogeologists? Okay, let’s make it easier for you: how many have more than a High School diploma?

Trump and Scott Pruitt post signs boasting about EPA deregulation, employees say it feels like a "slap in the face" http://bit.ly/2FeMQZ1 
Awesome 

Scotty, what are you doing about the waters of the United States? You going to pollute them? You haven’t done anything to help the environment! What are we paying you for besides 1st class airfare (which you need to pay back).
Supine no-federalism in action.
Red states, I hope!  And by “discussion” we all assume you mean “dismantling.”
You're a crook.
We now have an EPA that doesn't protect US citizens from industry.  Bad things happen when our government fails us.  Scott Pruitt is #NotFitToServe. Example of industry in action:
Co-*deregulators, stop tryna say you’re helping bro. Just quit your job, we don’t need you allowing these companies to screw our environment and public health
This song was recorded 3 years before your agency was founded. You have a duty to this country. Act like it.
