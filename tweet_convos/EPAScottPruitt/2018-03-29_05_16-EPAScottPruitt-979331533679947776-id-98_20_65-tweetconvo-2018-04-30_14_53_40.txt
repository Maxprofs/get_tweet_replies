It is “America’s favorite passtime” but it is “past time” for you to go dude.
You are not cute.
South Korea just had to cancel many baseball games due to pollution. How long before we do the same with your dip shit rollbacks? Jail is too good a place for you.

Stop spending taxpayer money, but keep up the good work on deregulation for emissions and fuel economy. Climate change is indeed a farce.
Those regulations you hate so much are what keep the rivers and lakes that your children fish and swim in safe. They keep the air they breathe clean. Maybe you are too young to remember the 1960's when rivers burned and mass numbers of fish died in lake Eerie. All polluted.

Resign
History will judge you as on of the men who doomed us to an unlivable world.
Are we paying for it?
Grifter, Thief, liar, destroyer of the planet.
You mean pastime?? D*psh*t...
Please stop hurting us American TaxPayers by taking 1st class trips to Morocco with your staff. We TaxPayers work hard for a living. We really need our TaxPayer dollars to help us everyday Americans. The more luxury we hear that you are living, the more we feel betrayed by you.
I thought your favorite pastime was destroying National Parks, flying first class on the taxpayer’s dime, and taking bribes from your industry pals.
You do know your dreams of taking Inhofe’s Senate seat and a future political career here in Oklahoma are over right?
How much of our tax money have you stolen? Resign now, and turn yourself in.
#Resign
Destroying the EPA. Scared of your constituents, and living on energy lobby $. You are a disgrace.
Play some real ball and #resign
You are a criminal & enemy #1 against the environment. You have NO  right to overturn regulations DESIGNED TO PROTECT AMERICANS. You abuse  taxpayers money by taking 1st class travel almost weekly to Oklahoma to  prepare for your Governor's run....SHAME SHAME SHAME
STOP WASTING OUR TAX PAYERS DOLLARS!
Idiot!
Wow, you joined WCCO radio in Minnesota and we had to cancel game because we thought we were going to have snow. This is not right in Minnesota in April. Think about it! Can you do your job?
No one can tell you’re losing your hair 


#BREAKING: Trump EPA to shut down office handling research on chemicals' effects on children's health http://hill.cm/8Vd58qR  
EXCLUSIVE: EPA chief Pruitt joined by family in condo tied to lobbyist 'power couple'
You are busted using tax payers $$$ for your personal trips. Awful
Ball my A, I hope we’re not paying for your Disney trips and baseball games because your scared. Get a dog dammit or stay home after work or find something else to do. Our tax dollars shouldn’t pay for you to play biggie rat !
Another hard-hitting tweet from the man who's responsible for safeguarding the future of our planet.
Yeah, you play ball with your cronies in industry. #Pruitt4Profit Visit link and click Top Donors to #followthemoney. https://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=6583668 …
I can't with you, a criminal and thief...more in your in your face crimeshttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-cabinet-trouble-trump-epa-chief-lived-condo/story?id=54095310
Energy lobbyists must have funded your promotion to EPA head, as education and merit were not factors.

I dunno...
Maybe you can. Most of us however WORK for a living.

 ABC News: "For much of his first year in Washington,  Trump’s EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt occupied prime real estate in a townhouse near the U.S. Capitol that is co-owned by the wife of a top energy lobbyist, property records from 2017 show." http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-cabinet-trouble-trump-epa-chief-lived-condo/story?id=54095310 …
Thanks for the clean air, soil and water. #GeoEngineering #ClimateEngineering #Chemtails #TheGreatAwakening @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse
Who should I believe  on climate change, hhmm, let me think. A politician lawyer or 99% of Scientists? Also, stop lying about past EPA’s travel expenses
Suck it!
That’s a bummer that my birth state and WCCO would welcome you for anything.  Minnesotans pride, or used to, themselves on environmental issues, conservation and real stewardship. Truly disappointed in WCCO.
Like @realDonaldTrump I'm too busy with documents to watch any opening day baseball. Why do you have time?
Your refusal to do anything about climate change is wrong. My granddaughters will suffer for your will ignorance. Shame on you. Baseball can wait. The habitability of the earth can’t.
Too busy working to talk to people about saving the planet from #climatechange, since you won't.

This energy lobbyist’s firm reported $16 million in lobbying income last year alone - let that sink in. Obscene amounts of dark money continue to flow into lobbying that turns up in Trump’s pork laden bills like the recent omnibus and tax legislation. https://twitter.com/kfile/status/979380598660837376 …
Everyone hates you for destroying our ONLY home. #firepruitt
While you are promoting baseball, perhaps instead you should read the New England J. Medicine article this week how your policies on pesticides are harming our children. Our children are more important than the $$$ from industry! Disgusting! Shame!

Can you also talk about resignation
Let's play pay back our money you blow on extravagant travel!
I hope you can try and protect Americans health, and so far you’ve failed miserably.
Don’t try to distract from the absolute atrocious job you are going at the EPA. You children and grandchildren will reap the impact of global warming and they will have you to blame for doing nothing. Even making it worse
Die in a pit.
Have a great time!
Keep working for climate change and we can have year round baseball Scotty!
Yeah go watch baseball.  Anything that distracts you from your atrocious dismantling of the EPA!
You are a vile human. Science is objective truth. Your opinion is based on self interest. Stop poisoning us.

To call Scott Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA a disaster is an understatement. 

Pruitt is rolling back the Clean Power Plan, the Clean…
Enjoy the fresh air while you can.  Oh, that's right.  You don't care about clean air, clean water, clean soil, clean energy, global warming, and preventing pollution.  You only care about the fossil fuel industry. #FirePruitt
Rather eat my own puke!
Resign and / or quit Twitter
Did you know? The effects of #climatechange are impacting our ability to use a cornfield in Iowa to summon the ghost of Shoeless Joe. Will you finally take actions as @EPA Administrator to battle #climatechange, like w/ #CleanPowerPlan, for our baseball ghosts? #OpeningDay
You sure are good at spending taxpayer money Pruitt, given your travels and expensive office doors, must be nice!
Focus on your job. BTW, you are suppose to protect the environment, not business.
Did we pay for your trip to Colorado to watch a ball game?
Enjoy it now cause if Pruitt has his way the air will soon be so thick from pollution you won't be able to watch anything.
You're corrupt and I hope you end up in jail with your fellow treasonous pals.
America’s favorite pastime has become monitoring the corrupt actions you and the rest of the administration are doing, and counting the days til your removal
@maddow  your next target #VoteThemAllOut #LockThemAllUp  #GOPTraitors  #RegisterToVote  #GOTV  #WinBlue
