#ettd
#resign 
You are a criminal & enemy #1 against the environment. You have NO  right to overturn regulations DESIGNED TO PROTECT AMERICANS. You abuse  taxpayers money by taking 1st class travel almost weekly to Oklahoma to  prepare for your Governor's run....SHAME SHAME SHAME
FAKE NEWS. You are not a man of god, Pruitt. You would have been tossed from the temple. You've shown through your actions and deeds to be a man who only cares about money and screwing over America

Attention EPA employees: if you are disciplined for using actual facts and science instead of Koch Brothers talking points regurgitated by the Administrator, I want to hear from you. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/03/29/the-energy-202-scott-pruitt-s-climate-message-is-now-official-epa-guidance/5abbfd3630fb042a378a2f23/?utm_term=.007a1e1f66dc …
Epix violator thief American taxpayers Scott Pruitt
NO STATE CAN PULL IT'S WEIGHT!! !
NICE ROBOTIC SMILE FROM THE PIECE OF SHIT at the EPA. It says, "I GET MONEY FROM OIL WHILE 'PROTECTING' THE ENVIRONMENT. HAHA"
Tell us about your Paris party at government expense. The one you missed your 10:15 am flight the next day. Woo hoo!  Fun times
pollution, pollution, pollution.  Keep screwing the environment and I hope the next severe storm remembers you and find you.  Nothing like dealing with storms that never had to deal with in my life until the last 10 years
Pruitt is a thief and a crook  and dangerous to the environment he has to go https://www.bootpruitt.com/background/

 ABC News: "For much of his first year in Washington,  Trump’s EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt occupied prime real estate in a townhouse near the U.S. Capitol that is co-owned by the wife of a top energy lobbyist, property records from 2017 show." http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-cabinet-trouble-trump-epa-chief-lived-condo/story?id=54095310 …
You mean under the rules that will harm workers and the environment.  How is that Christ like, Mr. so called Christian?
Suck it!
However, no #privatization is gonna be allowed. Our parents and grandparents built our roads, bridges and dams. We will NOT turn them over to corporations and billionaires! This idea is #DeadOnArrival. Any Dem that supports it will be voted out along with all GOP.
#BlueWave2018
He is one of Trump's worst picks and that's saying a lot.
Agree, in my opinion he is probably the worst sitting member in Trump's cabinet. Betsy DeVos is 2nd worst, but that's just me.

This energy lobbyist’s firm reported $16 million in lobbying income last year alone - let that sink in. Obscene amounts of dark money continue to flow into lobbying that turns up in Trump’s pork laden bills like the recent omnibus and tax legislation. https://twitter.com/kfile/status/979380598660837376 …


To call Scott Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA a disaster is an understatement. 

Pruitt is rolling back the Clean Power Plan, the Clean…
That’s our President streamlining the process to get things done and help the economy.
Distractions from the WORST PRESIDENT EVER, have helped keep Climate Change from getting the attention it vitally needs. But as awful as Trump is, YOU will have a far worst place in the history of the planet's destruction. Your family will carry the shame for generations. FACT!
Hanford Plutonium reactor sites line banks of the Columbia River in 1960.  The Hanford site as part of The Manhattan Projoct, now represents 60% of all radioactive waste (Plutonium) by volume of all radioactive in the US.  Superfund project.
http://frowiss.org/ .    Cancers as a result of Hanford
Shame on you Scott Pruitt for hiring as part of your environmental committee, a vice-president of a company that contaminated their employees with Plutonium dust at Hanford!!!!
More than 40 people inhaled Plutonium radioactive dust while working for a company at Hanford whose vice-President is now advising Scott Pruitt.
What’s Scott Pruitt doing about our nation’s employees contaminated by Plutonium at Hanford in Washington State.  Absolutely NOTHING!
I call BS.
Unless he gets fired
This administration has reversed what we gained with climate change twice over, all so the oil, gas and mining companies can make more money. Is that with it?
http://heritage.org/government-reg …  ---It is high time that the TVA—as well as its customers and U.S. taxpayers—benefit from the rigorous oversight of the private sector.--someone needs to investigate this! No oversight or accountability, this needs to change! #privatize #stopcorruption
Does this plan include privatizing highways so all the roads have tolls or will we actually see some of our federal dollars  going to rebuilding the infrastructure instead of filling the rich peoples pockets?
That’s the smile of the devil
You’re a national joke.
"Administrator Pruitt encourages an open, transparent debate on climate science," 

Dear Leader: The debate ended ages ago.…
At what cost to the environment and to our own long term health or doesn’t any of that matter to this administration?

You

Douche
Do Cade & McKenna enjoy breathing clean, fresh air? Will their children, your grandchildren, want to go to sailing camp? Or go to Steamboat to ski? Or the AT to hike?
Pruitt is a disaster for the EPA. Industry shill. Big agriculture shill. Climate science denier. Corrupt ignorant man. And he loves to fly first class on your dime.
lol
Pruitt, you are the worse thing to happen to the EPA! You need to resign
Projects that reduce regulatory controls for our environment is NOT what the EPA should be doing. Can we talk about less regulations and how that is a YUGE step backwards?
With no regard to environmental impact.  This administration is willing to trash our planet and our children’s future for short term profit and political gain.
Yes will proceed but wont be funded as usual.  Fake political theater!
There is one thing that is not uncertain. Scott Pruitt will be impeached if Democrats gain the house in November.
That's nice but when will #Chemtrails be acknowledged or addressed?? #StopSprayingUs @OpChemtrails @OpChemArchives @chemtrailsrevil @zerozoot
Hooray!!!
Not safely
At the expense of our health, our environment and our future in this planet? NO THANKS! #BootPruitt @EPAScottPruitt is a greedy, dishonest, science denying VILLAIN! Any reports to the contrary are #FakeNews! 
Jobs
Dotard.
Poor Scott Pruitt. He's too afraid to travel on a regular airplane. Everybody's making fun of me. I need to fly on Airforce plane where noone will see me wasting taxpayer money. Mommy don't send me to work at WH. I can't take it anymore! I'm always right!
How can this toxic human act "swiftly and safely" and not kill the planet and the people on it?
SCARY. Priutt's record of rule destruction suggests no new project can be environmentally safe. Find myself hoping infrastructure is stopped
What are they? You are too busy flying everywhere on private planes at taxpayer expense to know what is going on. 
For Pruitt, safety = as much money for polluters as possible and protection = protect the interests of the companies that extract and pollute
Thanks for letting me trash America! Have you seen those pictures of West Virginia? Your town can look like that too, while I line my pockets with kickbacks.

Liar
How much in KICKBACKS? Especially RUSSIAN OWNED companies? Do these costs figure in EXTRA HEAVY DUTY SECURITY STYLE FEATURES LIKE YOUR BUBBLE?




Right. Was that pedestrian bridge in Florida a test run?

Stop privatizing! Every time something is privatized taxpayers still spend money on the projects but have no control. Public infrastructure needs to stay in the public's hands. Stop selling off America.
Which, where and when? You are beggining to sound as brain dead as trump.

You mean all of those infrastructure projects the Republicans stopped during President Obama’s Administration? Those infrastructure projects?
Organize a WPA type program, staff with illegals, give min wage, housing/food/med supplement. Otherwise deport
Scott Pruitt is destroying the EPA and America's clean air and water.

The Trump administration is negligent to the point of being criminal in how they allow the EPA to degrade under Pruitt's watch.
This word just seems to fit well
Corruption and graft asap.
Poisonous Pruitt is messing up the country so badly it’s going to take decades to correct it all.
Thank goodness for Mr Pruitt 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/02/07/scott-pruitt-asks-if-global-warming-necessarily-is-a-bad-thing/ …
Pruitt? The same man who has spent taxpayer dollars like he was entitled to do so & is basically just one of the corrupt creepy crawly creatures who live in Trump's Swamp, formerly known as the White House.
Pruit's JOB description. To pro TECT the en VI ron ment.

Bullshit. He should be fired after his financial spending at the tax payers expense
Pruitt is a shining example of integrity and good faith.
Theives Senators,House Reps,Road&BridgeFirms,counties and small politicians take big chunks when billions are involved. Right now in NEPA. We will never utilize these round abouts as intended, they will fall into disarray costing millions. Then ditto when they get the gov grants.
Thank you Scott Pruitt
Bullshit!
#BootPruitt

It can be quick or it can be safe. It can't be both. Not if Pruitt is in charge.
Just like the one in South Florida that collapsed 2 days after it opened, killing several people? You people are despicable.
Oh. Like the pedestrian bridge in Florida? Oh please deregulate safety codes. You can kill a bunch of people all at once. @EPAScottPruitt is a total ass who is doing everything possible to legally kill people.
You mean under the new Trump Administration’s FAKE EPA that will let you destroy every bit of pure nature we have left in the name of ‘infrastructure.’ #LIES #TrumpLies #EPA #ImpeachTrump #UnfitforPresident #Resist #TheResistance
Wow!  It’s all falling down, My fair lady!
#Emoluments breaking news: The federal trial court in Maryland has denied Trump's motion to dismiss D.C. and Maryland v. Trump, so the case moves forward. It is a thorough opinion focused on standing. Decision is linked here: 1/ https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzmLEQBX1_PMMDUwNVM4RDdhVkptdnNfckZqcjFNeXFVYlg0/view?usp=sharing …
Creep
#MAGA #MAGA #MAGA #MAGA #MAGA #MAGA #MAGA #MAGA
But @PressSec  just suggested bridges and roads are a "local issue." You know, like Police killing black unarmed young men. 20 FREAKING TIMES!!!
Time for the democrat twitter bots to come out spreading misinformation and hate. It must be hard being liberal and not seeing good in anything, except their obsession with porn stars.
Another fake program to fleece the nation
How else do you expect us to pay the illegal immigrants
ask the businesses that keep hiring them
This means that any polluting companies are free to spew
Scott Pruitt is venal, ignorant, stupid - much like his boss.  Doesn't look like any destructive  infrastructure projects will get off the ground, though.  @SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @NancyPelosi @SpeakerRyan

The Unions should like this and have all of thier members working
This infrastructure is long overdue,way to go President Trump,every time you make a new announcement,I see the failure of the Obama administration to address these very important issues,thank you again.
You realize the infrastructure bills must originate in congress, right? The GOP have held congress for how long? And we still are yet to see any meaningful action. But sure, blame Obama. Clown.
No toll roads, please.
What are these new rules? Funnel money to the GOP?
Of course! yes! The GOP and I Thank you
Today’s @nytimes editorial:

“We live at a time when a porn star displays more credibility and class than a president.”
Lol look a flying pig !
You get one person killed by your deregulation it's on you.
Great picture of Pruitt! You guys at the White House are always showing us your best work, aren't you?
He's there to dismantle the EPA for King Tangerine and all the rich polluting corporations.

Nothing more, nothing less.
This Is A Most Needed National Project...Rebuild Decaing America and Provide Jobs For Thousands!!
The Democrats Only Care About Illegals...They Want More...More To Be Supported By YOUR TAX DOLLARS!!
Awesome Scotty!! Windmills and solar energy, stop the fracking; man you are doing great! All the roads lead to Russia, ehh I mean Rome....
FAKE NEWS!!!
Oh the CONtractors are smiling as they prepare to rip off,and fleece taxpayers using unsound and low quality materials. We will pay multiple times to fix the third rate environmentally damaging mess they will make to profit themselves.
#climatechange is real  please protect America
Pruitt has gutted protections of clean water and air, why should we trust him with infrastructure? Pruitt and Trump are in the pocket of developers and strip miners.
Another @WhiteHouse Whopper.

How much has Scottie blown on travel?
At Church now
What an idiot .@EPAScottPruitt and .@realDonaldTrump for putting such clowns in the .@Cabinet and .@WhiteHouse He has made a mockery of this country.
Sounds like code for let's pollute like crazy so we can race to complete projects that are neither safe nor environmentally sound... for shame!
...for money.
They'll all end up like a Florida pedestrian bridge ...
Because who needs clean air and water?
Stop trying to make Infrastructure Week happen.  It's not going to happen!  #StormyDanielsInterview
Did you even check to see if #bootpruitt is trending?  Because it is 
Right...like the pedestrian bridge that collapsed in Florida? Welcome to the Trump Administration!
@EPAScottPruitt is the true definition of the word ‘swamp creature’
#BootPruitt Scott Pruitt is a scumbag who is poisoning our children for profit and wasting taxpayer money for his paltry trips.
What do you expect?  He works for the Scumbag-in-Chief.
