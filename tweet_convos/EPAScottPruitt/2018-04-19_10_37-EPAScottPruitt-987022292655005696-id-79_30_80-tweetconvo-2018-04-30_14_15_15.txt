I think you guys need to retire the word tremendous.
How's the water infrastructure in Paris and Morocco? Did Samantha help you check things out or did you just check her out or maybe in?

170 members of Congress have introduced a resolution calling for Scott Pruitt’s resignation. https://www.scribd.com/document/376735298/Resolution-Calling-on-Resignation-of-EPA-Administrator-Scott-Pruitt …
Good job Scott!!
How was your first class ticket to Chicago? How many bribes didn’t you come to collect? When are you going to get off your ass and resign?
Hanford clean up mismanaged by CH2 Hill.  CEO on Pruitt’s Environmental Judicial Advisory Committee.
it’s other people’s money  #MAGA
It would be great if the head of the Environmental Protection Agency actually gave a damn about the environment.
@GOP Majority Now Want 2 #RemoveScottPruitt4GoodCausesShown
More pablum from you. You continue to weaken protections on the environment, all while wasting taxpayer dollars, ignoring science, and retaliating against whistleblowers. What a travesty.
Excellent job #ScottPruitt. You are doing a fantastic job on environmental controls. The #dimrats are out to destroy the #environment and the way of life of citizens. Keep up the great work of doing the right thing for the people and #environmental #sustainability.
you're the most corrupt politician in DC - isn't that saying something?
Yeah?  Fixed that problem in Flint, Michigan yet???
How much did that COST SCOTT!!
Here you stopped by the “Mascot Museum” while in Chicago.  You heavy some big cojones, S....hole.
My apologies to all Chicago EPA employees who had to fake smiles next to their corrupt administrator.
Made me literally laugh out loud. Thanks.
How many open investigations on the EPA does the inspector general have now? Aren't we great again? Trumpskiyevski 2020
Good Lord, way too close to Michigan. Keep your polluting ways elsewhere.
Did you fly triple first class on this too ?
#IndictPruitt4GoodCausesShown EPA FELON Scott Pruitt now being investigated by the @HouseDemocrats @SenateDemocrats @WH @OMB @GAO @EPA#InspectorGeneral https://boingboing.net/2018/04/19/epa-head-scott-pruitt-is-being.html … #CountThePruittFeloniesInOffice #ConvictIncarceratePruitt

You're nothing but a corrupt flunky for the oil companies - resign!
Did you fly first class?
RESIGN #BootPruitt
@GOP  @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP   How did you get there, Scotty? Private plane? Military Plane? First Class commercial plane? Motorcade with 20 security guards, 3 SUVs ...lights flashing, sirens blaring? #FirePruitt #VoteWithVengeance
Kleptocrat.
I'm sure you'll pull her funding soon ... you know .... because "regulatory certainty"  #Resign
on top of all your other faults, you are a micromanager....but we're not falling for it #bootpruitt
RESIGN. YOU’RE A CROOK AND YOU’RE DOING IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
What damage?

While Pruitt was in state govt, NY Times says a lobbyist sold him a home for $100k less than she had paid for. Her telecom employer paid the difference. He then voted to let the employer raise its rates. At EPA he hired her +…
The American people will cheer the day you leave public office and go back to squeezing, in both hands, the hoards of cash you’ve accumulated. Go lie in your dirty money and leave America better off
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Dealing with extreme weather from climate change in Northern Mi--snow and ice in mid April  has cancelled lots of sports activities, and has hurt our migratory birds and orchards.
Stepp is awful, like you.
Did you fly there first class, wasting more of the taxpayers money???
This is your legacy~~A fucking crook and a traitor
39 senators. That’s the most ever—in all of American history—to formally call for the resignation of a Cabinet-level official.

That’s how bad Scott Pruitt is — for the EPA, for taxpayers, for our…
#resign #useless
Your legacy is set as one of corruption & greed without concern for people or the planet.
BREAKING
GAO finds @EPAScottPruitt violated two federal laws.

RESIGN YOU THIEF…
Quit.

Trying to get some extra traveling in before you’re out of a job? #Time2Resign
Tens of millions of good Americans can’t wait till the Inspector General calls you out for your lack of ethics, corruption and unfitness for your ‘post.’ #BootPruittNow @chelliepingree @SenAngusKing @SenatorCollins @RepPoliquin #FirePruitt

Why don't you reinstate the Stream Protection Act that Trump repealed to prevent mining companies from dumping their toxic waste into streams?
How did you get there?
Climate change is real and man made
#Resign
EPA head Scott Pruitt is being investigated by the House of Representatives, Senate, White House, Office of Management and Budget, Government Accountability Office, and EPA Inspector General  https://boingboing.net/2018/04/19/epa-head-scott-pruitt-is-being.html …
The Senate still has a say, but Scott Pruitt sided with the shipping industry: "Clean Water Act protections will continue to apply to ballast water discharges, which are the main pathway for aquatic invasive species introductions into the Great Lakes."
#TreasonWeasel
From @LFFriedman: A Guide to the Investigations Faced by Scott Pruitt, E.P.A. Chief https://nyti.ms/2JXysrs 
Did you waste more taxpayer money by flying there first class?  Or on a charter flight or military flight?
You're a disgrace in just about every way.
You Need to resign! Stealing from the taxpapers is a crime!
...and her only connection to environmental policy is that her husband's construction company sued EPA because it wouldn't let him fill in wetlands anytime he felt like it. This is Scotty's vision for America's environmental watchdog. He's an industry lobbyist.
Resign, and make restitution for your unlawful expenditures.
How have you not resigned yet? Federal investigation #10!
Enjoy the Inspector General investigation into your graft and theft. You are a fraud should be in jail.
No Pruitt tweet, even one purportedly crediting and thanking others, would be complete without at least four photos of the man, the myth, the legend!

Narcissus personified
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenSchumer Give this #TrumpGrifter the hook already!
#PruittMustGo
Bet you wouldn’t drive to Flint for a refreshing glass of tap water. 
Hostilities there can’t be any worse than those of - ugh - coach class.
Thank you for the job you are doing Admin. Pruitt. I had no idea the danger you face. Be safe. And thank you for MAGA. 
#Bots don't breathe but the do call out "danger"
Ah, yes, Cathy Stepp. Apparently to Scotty the only requirement necessary to lead a region is a hatred of the agency you work for. Cathy Stepp has no college degree (and I don't mean no applicable degree, like Scotty, I mean her crowning academic honor is a High School diploma...
How many secret service members did you bring?  Did you drive in a motorcade in you &100,000.00 SUV?   Did you spend leisure time in Chicago?  Watch the game last night?  How much of our hard earned money did you waste?
Record number of congressmen want you to resign. What a proud day to be Scott Pruitt
When are you resigning?
#FirePruitt Resign. Your waste, fraud, and abuse not only diminishes the office you hold but also further tarnishes the @realDonaldTrump administration. Any one can cut regulations. You should shill for Carl Icahn on his dime not that of American tax payers. #FiscalResponsiblity
Let me guess, first class with 3 armored Suburban SUVs ?
Please, for the love of god, resign.  Resign now.  You will be tainted forever for what you have done to our county.
#ThursdayThoughts why is @EPAScottPruitt still in office
