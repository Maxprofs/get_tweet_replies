Some 300 scientists and environmental protection specialists have departed the agency during the Trump administration:

This song was recorded 3 years before your agency was founded. You have a duty to this country. Act like it.

Is that enough to cover the costs of your phone dome and first class air ?

One of the truly effective and thus dangerous members of the Trump Administration. Polluting, Profiteering, Pruitt is now wanting to work privately on the side for companies and individuals. Of course, he wants those to be kept secret. Ethics do not exist in this administration.
News is that you have allowed employees to work for anonymous corporations while EPA employers.
Swampy, corrupt behavior. But that’s Scotty.
Simplifying hazardous waste regulations --> Love Canal, Hinckley CA, ozone degradation,  photochemical smog,  groundwater contamination.   You are as unqualified and toxic as @betsydevosed
You need to change "EPA" to "EDA" -- Environmental Deregulation Agency.  You care more about corporations' profits than about children's health.
You are f*ing up our environment

Judge agrees with AG Ferguson that EPA violated the Clean Air Act by delaying air quality standards for ground-level ozone pollution – another successful outcome in a case that has not yet resolved. Ruling: http://agportal-s3bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploadedfiles/Another/News/Press_Releases/2018%2003%2012%20Order%20Granting%20Summary%20Judgment.pdf … Case background: …
That can’t be when you Closed the EPA Office that researches the effects of chemicals on children’s health.
What does it mean to "simplify hazardous waste regulations"?
How much is this new crazy idea about stopping global warming going to cost the Taxpayers? Where is the proof that this has anything to do with global warming?
Pruitt, finally you are actually doing something constructive! That’s a first.
Not sure Jesus would approve—you’re in some big trouble with the man upstairs, mister!
What's the catch
Excellent job Mr Pruitt!  Great work

EPA Chief Pruitt's aide given permission to work for private clients on the side - but their identities will be kept secret. http://apne.ws/rgE3yz6 
"encouraging" recycling? Is that really enough? You work for us and for the safety of our planet. This is a huge responsibility. You have shown that you do not understand the repercussions of your actions. Do you still think climate change is good?
Please read this @EPAScottPruitt and be honest like the Bible teaches —
Who is John Konkus moonlighting for? You should clear the air (sic) to avoid a conflict of interest.

How many times per day so you say the BS business-speak phrase, “We remain committed to protecting human health and the environment, while also providing regulatory certainty to American businesses," Scott?
#ImpeachPruitt
It's called "hazardous" for a reason, Scott. If you had any understanding of science, you would make informed, logical choices.
Is this not already covered under EPA's  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)? If not, how is it different?  The article is very vague at explaining how this "big news" is better than RCRA.
But still, dear, you want to destroy large areas of our national parks & monuments due to your overwhelming corruption for Big Oil/King Coal, so any improvements you make will not go to your credit.
Resign now
