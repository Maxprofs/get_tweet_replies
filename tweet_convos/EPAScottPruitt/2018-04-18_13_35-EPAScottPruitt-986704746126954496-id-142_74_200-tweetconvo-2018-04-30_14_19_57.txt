American tech breakthroughs would come faster if there were greater certainty about US commitment to reduce emissions. (Duh.)
And also, don’t take credit for progress that resulted from @BarackObama policies.
Total B.S. sir! Your ignorance is profound. Reality is 180 degrees rejecting 8 years under a FRAUD president who’s only achievement was to drive USA towards a DARK AGE of stupidity. Thank God for DJT 
You are in a position of science, not a position of politics. The impacts of fossil fuel use is science. "Bringing back" coal jobs to get a vote while denying science, is politics. Solutions must include wind and solar because that's where real ingenuity and breakthrough is.
IMO @EPAScottPruitt You are doing an astounding job! Keep up the excellent work and ignore all the useless noise from the left!
Actual scientists don’t agree with you.
Also, this report only tabulates greenhouse gasses through the end of 2016, a month before idiot took office.
Everyone was wrong on giving you a job
The “reduced emissions” you’re referring to occurred up through 2016. Do you know who the POTUS was in 2016?
Obama was POTUS in 2016
Omg. Just stop. Stop putting your political ambitions over the well-being of the planet!! #corrupt #gopgrift #pruittresign #bootpruit
Good job!! Glad that @EPAScottPruitt & @potus are not falling for #CORRUPT #Climate Change schemes #ParisAccord
U.S. EXPORTS Its greenhouse-gas emissions, as GOV OWNED COAL. Driving up energy @ home, CHEAP Energy 4 COMPETITORS http://wapo.st/1ZGUUra

Those of us in the treatment field and the families of those who suffer from addiction have been fighting the opioid epidemic for over a decade.  Please don't give the credit to Pres. Trump or any member of Congress.  We the people had to push, and push and push them to join us.
This is so completely wrong. Resign now, criminal
Don’t take credit for something you did not do. Greenhouse gasses are down because companies are moving away from coal and using renewables Americans want the CPP and if you really cared about America or the environment you would continue to encourage that growth. #FirePruitt
Delete your account. #BootPruitt 
They are happening in spite of you and Trump. Stop praising your non existing efforts to protect the environment. The corruption is so flagrant we can smell it and it is pure decay. Resign.
#ThursdayThoughts why is @EPAScottPruitt still in office
#freemarkettrumpsregulations
Haven’t you embarrassed your family, friends and the state of Oklahoma enough? If you’re so damned scared of “We The People” that you can’t even sit near us on a plane, you should shut the hell up. We don’t care about your opinions or anything else you have to say. Just shut up.
No thanks to you.  Why not subsidize clean energy sources such as wind and solar like we do fossil fuels?  Oh wait...
You’re a grifting liar. It’ll take years to reverse the damage you’ve already done. Thankfully, your days are already numbered.
Scott Pruitt upgraded from slime ball to totally disingenuous slime ball.
I hope you realize that by changing the regulations to allow companies to pollute our water and air hasn't started totally affecting the climate yet, but it will and you and trump will be blamed. EPA now = Environmental Pollution Agency.
You call yourself a “Christ Follower”. And then do everything possible to go against the teachings of Christ.

So called SCIENTISTS who claim AGW are self serving money grabbers! Shame on them and shame on governments who believe the NON-SCIENCE hysteria!
CO2 is REQUIRED for the biomass the replenish itself. Plants and trees take in CO2 and exhale Oxygen as well as fix Nitrogen in global soil. Humans do not contribute anywhere near ( by factor of 1000!) the CO2 and Methane needed to sustain global health.
Thank you and POTUS for realizing that the flawed and inaccurate IPCC claims are HARMING the global environment instead of helping. Climate Change is a NATURAL cycle due to SOLAR radiation with less than 0.1% due to GHG.
You know to gauge the success of The Trump Administration cabinet members? on how much the #Rabid #Leftist attack them.@EPAScottPruitt is doing a great job, they attack him relentlessly, keep up the great work! the working American citizens are depending on you. @realDonaldTrump
RESIGN!
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @washingtonpost
Your credibility is wanting
Do you agree that all of us should leave this world better than we found it? Because if you do, what the both of you are doing is setting up my children and your children to have to adapt to horrendous climate change effects or die!  You have no moral right to do it! #FirePruitt
Said by one whose primary career accomplishment has been suing gov't to profit corporations & avoiding inconvenient truths about climate. You also seem moochy, as in wanting more than you give, always expecting the other guy to pay the lunch tab. Ur a strange duck, little man.
Then why bot keep the fuel standards?

FFS you people are numb - you're literally touting the results of previous administrations, and then saying it's not working. 

Can't wait till November.
*not
I don't believe you. #FirePruitt
Pruitt, you have no idea what you’re suppose to do. Should have listened to the real scientists instead of firing them. Resign!
How much of our money did you spend today on something just for you?
Sad.
What science proves this? I forgot, you don't trust s scientific findings!
Hell yeah, lets burn some more coal and ruin our atmosphere for our future generations.....  The only  reason #Trump wants it his way is because it's the opposite of the #Obama administration.
You have no creditably Pruitt! You are on the same level with Trump when it comes to lying. If you have anything to debate you will need to show documentation to verify your statements. You are without character, integrity and honesty. @maddow @JoyAnnReid @AriMelber @chrislhayes
Tech breakthroughs & innovations largely driven by regs & agreements like CAFE standards, CPP, Paris Agreement. Auto manufacturers & power companies have no profit motive in reduced green house emissions or clean air.
Mr Environmental Polution Advocate, do you live on this planet or are you just another bot?
You are f *cking up,our environment
I love how you trigger the environmental nazi’s. Good job sir!  The BEST #epa leader the US has ever had!
Swamp Monster 
BYE!

President Trump’s budget cuts could doom nearly 200 Hawaiian plant species to rapid extinction, conservationists warn. http://bit.ly/2JUgEx4  
Boot pruitt
Protecting our environment is not a business. It is your duty as head of this agency. All you seem to do is to dismantle protections to benefit your business associates. You are a disgrace. Resign.
Oh Scott, try and MAGA your way out of the millions of tax payer dollars you’ve wasted on soundproofing and broken doors and luxury flights.
How about a little focus on clean air, waters, and making a stand against pollution, instead of catering to big businesses that give you kickbacks so they can pollute at willYou’re a disgrace to America and your last days are coming. You and your kind will be gone soon.
What do u think the Paris Accord is 4. It requires other countries  2 reduce emissions over a certain amount of time.We just happened 2 b on track 4 the reduction of emissions.However, your reduction of environmental regulations will change that.Clean air act is important.
How’s your disgraced banker buddy doing?
So why are you stifling future innovation and suppressing #science at the EPA of all places?
Even under scrutiny, #PollutingPruitt continues to be little more than a mouthpiece for bogus fossil fuel industry talking points.
Another point. A small reduction in emissions equates to a small reduction in the acceleration of temperature increases. CO2 already too high and STILL GOING UP. Temperature already going up and will go up FASTER because of these emissions.
Liar. #Sycophant #HowDoesHeStillHaveAJob #TrumpSwampMonster
Liar

It is abundantly clear that Scott Pruitt has abused the public trust by using his government position to finance his lavish lifestyle & likely violated ethics rules. He must resign or be fired immediately→ https://bit.ly/2qIp3Lw  
Does your middle name start with an O?   It would make a lot of sense because you are a backwards POS!!!
Sorry, I don’t believe anything that comes out of your unethical office. #Time2Resign
Lies, lies, and more lies.
T R A I T O R
Administrator Pruitt is doing a GREAT JOB.
Pruitt you are a disgrace to the American people supporting BIG Corporations that manufacture GMO's/glysophates and other toxic pesticides that are destroying us and this planet. Do your job for the health of the people and our country.
Either Pruitt, Trump, Steve Bannon and Bashar al Assad are right...
or ALL THE OTHER COUNTRIES and 71% of Americans are right...  hmmmmm 
BTW most Republicans think leaving the Paris accords was a bad idea, Scotty
Please stop with the verbal diarrhea nobody believes you and the only time you need to Tweet is when you're announcing your resignation.
Keep up the good work
# BootPruitt


Resign now before even the lobby groups refuse to hire you later
What years does 2018 report encompass?
Americans need to understand that President Trump and Scott Pruitt are looking at the big picture and WILL reduce emissions.

After the looming collapse of American Society following the Trump Administration bankrupting America, we won't have money, hence won't have cars. #MAGA
Wow.. you lie. You changed they way they are measured so the data looks in your favor.  Plus any reductions are result of previous years work by EPA.  Why can’t you tell the truth ever?
Cite your source. If it's an @EPA report, it simply lacks credibility under your "leadership." You've run off most of the scientists and politicized what should be objective measurement. Your tweet confirms that.
I work at the EPA in Cincinnati. You wouldn't believe how many really good scientist have retired this year or left for corporate jobs. Very sad.
Resign.
Time to RESIGN PRUITT!
Energy dominance?

You should both be ashamed of yourselves. You think being environmentally responsible is expensive, just wait until you see the full impact of be environmentally irresponsible!!! Fools!!!!
Am I the only one that’s noticed that @EPAScottPruitt’s name is an #Anagram for #FuckingAsshole?
arm photon torpedoes
clean sustainable energy (wind, solar, geothermic) NOT coal, not reducing standards on fuel efficiency, air & water quality, and land preservation.... THIS will ensure our survival sir, not our "dominance"
Not that Scotty here has the training or intellect to understand the data but, hey, if he doesn't push back those O&G checks may stop coming (and with unemployment looming a guy needs all the scratch he can get).
Resign now

@realDonaldTrump You're both disgusting crooks, destroying the environment as well as American values.
Queue the climate cultists and their hyperbolic rants.
Queue the climate deniers and their uninformed, illogical, contradictory-purely-for-the-sake-of-it, more-concerned-about-snubbing-liberals-than-our-future lunacy.
Queue the responses to my original tweet by folks who think the science is settled and any debate on how much money & resources applied to EPA policy should never be questioned.
You do realize that the GHG report proves exactly the opposite of what our esteemed EPA director is claiming though, right?
Resign MFer before we have to force you out on your ass.
this is why he spends money on security. Lots of mentally unstable freaks like you that are calling for physical violence. Seek a mental evaluation.
Pruitt, you have no credibility with anyone paying attention. You're a corrupt political hacks who works for the highest bidder, regardless of the damage to the broader industry or country overall, so long as your owners get what they paid for. Read it:
B - U - L - L - S - H - I - T

As long as this thread is, it still doesn't begin to cover all the destruction of Scott Pruitt #PollutingPruitt

How Scott Pruitt Is Gutting the EPA on Behalf of the Fossil-Fuel Industr…
What is the EPA doing about METHANE emissions? NOTHING

Ask the @AmerMedicalAssn  about coal and its effect of worsening asthma and heart conditions.  You’re literally and figuratively making people sick.  DO YOUR JOB!
You have the courage to tweet? Wow, I thought you were simply corrupt, you're also not a candidate for Mensa.
39 senators and 131 Representatives all want you gone.

This data is from 2016. So, unless you are magic, this data is 100% Trump- and Pruitt-free. You can’t claim credit for anything. #BootPruitt
The data used is from 1990-2016 but the report was released in 2018 by a corrupted EPA with 700 fewer climate scientists and an agenda based purely in greed.
And even then it still proves exactly the opposite of what Pruitt is claiming. The report demonstrates that current policies are working. Emissions have decreased. Alternative energy sources & more efficient methods for burning fossil fuels has decreased pollution. Go figure...
There is no profit motive in cleaning up the environment. That’s why we have regulations!
Keep up the great work Sir !!!!!
Coal is a public health problem. Why do you promote it?
In 2016 30% of the power generated in the U.S. came from coal. It's not something you can just switch off.

Since 90s it's been reducing as natural gas takes its place. Eventually it will be phased out. You should check what powers the plants in your area. You might be surprised
The point of those agreements is to reduce emissions, you just admitted America has reduced emissions and we're still in them. Also you resign yet?!?
You keep pushing misinformation on climate change and making excuses for doing nothing. Disgusting.

#BootPruitt #Thief #BlowjobsForLobbyists
Magic fairy dust will make everything better !
You are a two-faced lying fraud that should be in prison, not in any office representing our country.
Where are documents, everybody can talk, We want to see proof.
Climate-change denier says What?

This song was recorded 3 years before your agency was founded. You have a duty to this country. Act like it.
