The #WhiteHouse has a role to play for US national interests, quite independently of the psychotic woman-abuser in one of the main offices. What are the chances that @FLOTUS has any idea what self-respect is, in the face of "DD" being a compromised FlyByNight sex hound? #NAFTA

Reminder: @KenCalvert voted against the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act for women. @TeamCalvert
Honor women? Not when you have the pu$$y grabber in chief sitting there.

Coffee spits out of nose.....
POTUS especially
#InternationalWomensDay here's a novel idea: Celebrate this occasion by @POTUS COMING CLEAN with the Nation regards to his #SexualAbuse #SexualMisconduct #Rape 
#Adultry with a truthful apology for #LiesAndThreats about all of it for this many years as an insult to Women!
Vets do not boycott the NRA. U speak for none of us. We have guns & lists of ammo to protect us from idiots like you. Carry on.
As a woman I find it disheartening that after fighting 4 our place in the military we have now been reduced 2 boobs & vaginas. I am a former SOLDIER & very proud of my accomplishments. I don’t want or need recognition or accolades bc I can do more than cook, clean & give birth.

Women need equality in social,religious ,political and in economic field.
Why did the President have sex with #StormyDaniels while @FLOTUS takes care of their baby? #Impeach45 
#PresidentDennison @realDonaldTrump #PervertTrump
Well since no one else will tell you, I will. That’s none of your business. Who he jigs all over is NONE of our business. Who he pays to suck his privates is NONE of our business. That is his wife’s business & that woman owes you NO EXPLANATION. Go to the hookers twitter 4 info.
Spoken like a true Christian. 
When it’s the President of the United States, it’s everybody’s business. #StormyGate

#FakeNews Really, what about all those women you disrespected?
You do none of those things.
God bless the women of this world
Thank You,
FU 
Looking forward to seeing you &  being indicted.
Unbelievable hypocrisy.

Jajaja That is a good one! You mean Groper in chief, whose Budget viciously cuts International aid programs that are meant to benefit women "honors them"? How much hypocrisy & hubris does this administration have? Just shut up please!
This woman hates this WH #impeachthemoron #firePruitt

Pay to play?
Seriously? Don’t bother, no one believes this tweet from this WH.
When’s #InternationalMensDay ?  Given the constant attack on men lately, it would be nice to honor the REAL men in the world. Those who respect women, protect their families, raise their children, and honor their country. I’d support that as well.
Twitter is not Google
Aren’t you special?!  You apparently have zero ability to read sarcasm. You probably qualify for some type of assistance.
Sarcasm on the internet. Yay you for you!
I nominate Ayaam Hirsi Ali as a notable woman who is awakening the west to real dangers of the Medina Muslims. #InternationalWomensDay #MAGA

FYI
how, he's not gonna grab them for a day?
@realDonaldTrump @VP @PressSec  @HouseGOP @GOP @SenDuckworth @SenKamalaHarris This #SHITHOLE admin is trying to take away our POWER but women will rule. We have no voice in this admin and you AGAINST US!! You are shameless to mothers that birth you.
What about the ones who are suing trump?
@realDonaldTrump 's grab'em by the pussy day
No, you don't...not so long as the current administration is there...you don't!

Happy? 
The American people know genuine when they see it. Right on @HillaryClinton.
HONESTLY FU
What about all the women @realDonaldTrump has sexually assaulted?  You know - the ones he says are all liars.  What about his wife that he cheats on?  What about his ex wife - the one he raped?
What a joke
Good

Especially to Stormy Daniels!
quit lying you have no respect for women
How about the 19 accusing the pu$$y-grabbing #FakePresident. @realDonaldTrump ?
This is what you post?  Give me a break.
The only way Trump supports women is paying them off so they are not able to tell their stories about him.

This is a joke right? #WomensDay
Hey 
On International #womensday, don't use words for women like 'empower' and 'celebrate'. Use words like 'hire', 'promote', 'pay', 'raise', 'bonus', 'invest', 'fund', 'enrich' - and DO IT. #IWD #IWD2018 
I hope Stormy is  being honored...and the Russian hookers Trump entertained...
Yes I m World Mr Rabin Das Thanks White House Happy International women's Day Have A Great Day Mrs Melania Trump and Mrs Ivanka Trump and FBI all Women's and CIA all Women's God bless You
Hollow Words Award ... your Administration is working to implement so many policies that work against women's rights and dignity ... do you think women (and men) don't notice all that?
Then recognize & honor all the women who have been assaulted by the predator in the Oval Office!
#Guilty #groper
Yeah #ImWithHer
ARE you going to help the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans?

Love the women right Donny?
#SexualPredatorTrump
God bless

And we will be running our House soon. Sit back and watch us.
Bet it went down a bomb in the Middle East

I love Women and I am more Single than James Mattis. They call me Jedi I am so Isolated.

Thank you.
Keep your empty, meaningless messages about women. Trump’s history with women says it all: sexual assault, insults,  misogyny.
Trump is a hypocrite. He has only subjugated women not celebrated
Congratulations.
Really?  Save it folks.
Nope. No you don't.

Long live STORMY DANIELS!!! Hip Hip, Hooray!
Mary especially!
Major props from way on the other  side to Sarah Huckabee Sanders. No doubt the hardest job in the history of jobs. And she is so good!  Undeniable
Don't even try...this is the most anti-woman admin in decades.
Seriously? What a shallow empty statement
Especially Stormy!
REALLY...???...

Except when it comes to the decisions we should be able to make about our own bodies, amirite?
Honoring women by just showing us their backsides? It speaks volumes about the current administration.
Wanna prove that statement??? Finish ratifying the equal rights amendment that passed several years ago but the didn't get ratified because of states not doing it. Get that finished and prove it. If not your words and statement's are garbage...
And their legal teams, lining up in increasing numbers to file suits.
2 men with #DomesticViolence charges worked there. @realDonaldTrump is a #sexualabuser. @FLOTUS has done nothing about #cyberbullying. @IvankaTrump plays #daddysgirl. @KellyannePolls & @PressSec lie constantly. @BetsyDeVosED & @HHSGov hurt women & LGBTQ. #InternationalWomensDay
Women should be having an impeachment March on Washington today!

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Wait...is this a serious tweet? In that case: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH!!! What. A. Scumbag. #ScumbagPOTUS
Just 4 months ago, Trump endorsed a man for Senate who molested teen girls. That is NOT a way to honor women

We can celebrate by purging the current administration.
Unless, of course, they are accusing @realDonaldTrump of something.  Then they are just liars, attention seekers and money-grubbers, right?
Are you sure about that? @realDonaldTrump sexually harassed 20+ women and surrounds himself with men who abuse women.
No, you don't. Not a damn one of you working in the White House or supporting the current GOP's agenda honors women. #TimesUp

This WH? Can't be serious!
how can the WH and Trump recognize Women's day when he couldn't even say one word about the Women marching right past the WH.. He had the nerve to say he didn't notice.. LIAR... Russia Sanctions? Stormy? Jared in Mexico? @realDonaldTrump still in the WH? Suing CA? Stupid!!
Who are the “we” in the White House you are talking about? Can’t be man in Oval or his chief of staff.


I guess P45 is now PRO CHAIN-MIGRATION. Another FLIP FLOP. Go  figure.
It's my preference to celebrate all people not to celebrate one gender or the other
@realDonaldTrump 
@FoxNews  
@FLOTUS 
@VP 
@FoxNews 
Why did P45's lawyer pay STORMY DANIELS $130K? Did he pay her with CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS?
Then tomorrow we go back to grabbing them by the pussy #HYPOCRITES
By sexually abusing them? By taking away their reproductive freedoms? Huh?
Donald Trump. 19 women. Rob Porter. 2 women.
Or as DJT calls it, "Grab 'em by the pussy" day
Disingenuous AF
Why?
Just don't be like @realDonaldTrump and grab them by the pussy or pay them off to keep the affair a secret
honor for kurdish women in afrin

I actually didn’t know there was such a thing. That’s pretty cool. When is Men’s Day? I’d like to know when to celebrate the men in my family 
The Rapist in Chief honors women? Um no.
Which started in Russia in 1917 and set off the February revolution and is the recognition of Russian women contributing to the liberation of Russians from the monarchy. But with Putin running the White House it makes sense.
Is there ever an International Men’s Day.  We want equal time.  Maybe the President should issue an Executive Order to make it happen.  No kidding.  Men matter too.  JM
Wow Trump hates women. You guys don't honor women at all and want them barefoot  , preggo and in the kitchen with no voice.
Gonna be a whole lot of p#$$y grabbing today eh?
And the ones in Ivanka’s sweatshops?
Grab 'em by the pussy, right?
Better explain to Donald that today is not the day to be grabbing crotches.
Yea right ask the 19 women who have  come out publicly and accused @realDonaldTrump of sexual harassment and then there's #StormyDaniels #grab em by the p+ssy
"You have to treat [women] like shit." - Donald Trump, New York magazine, November 9, 1992 #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2018
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! Today we recognize, honor, and celebrate women around the world. 

Send a prostitute to the Oval Office , it’s been a little while !! Just have a check ready to buy her silence . Going rate is $130,000.00
This White House only wants women on their backs! Try telling the truth! Canada celebrations women better. Check out our cabinet.
pussy grabbing trump ...
Even stormy daniels?
Kinda makes you want to grab this day by the p**sy doesn’t it?!
Come on...seriously?
Honor Stormy Daniels by allowing her to tell her story.

This just seems wrong.
Lies.
f no
Why? These women? Are you kidding? They are opportunists, trying to get out of their own skins and rough us all up for wanting to be what we were created for. The hand that rocks the cradle of love and family, with a man at our side and in our bed.
Of course women day, thank you Regards
Especially, porn stars, right? President PIG should probably never mention anything about celebrating women. It's gross. HE'S gross.
#grabthembythepussy
#StormyDaniels
Grab em by the pussy, right @realDonaldTrump
Does that include Stormy Daniels?
With an abuser of woman at the helm.. shame shame shame #MeToo @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS
Even in STORMY  weather

Dalit Indians do wish happy International women's day to all.
I'm especially celebrating Stormy Daniels.
As we observe #internationalwomensday2018 let Us appreciate THE WONDERFUL WOMEN that make our lives RICHER AND better every day !! @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump #maga @realDonaldTrump
Oh the irony
You know what women say to you and this administration....FXXX YOU
