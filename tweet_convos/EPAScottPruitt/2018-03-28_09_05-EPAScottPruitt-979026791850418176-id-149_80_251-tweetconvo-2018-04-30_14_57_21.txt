I reject the false choice that you can either have a strong economy or a strong environment. We can do both.
@KamalaHarris Help, please!
You're about to be replaced with the local fox news weather person

Your response is obviously a lie. You have been dreaming of the day that you could go and get in position to dismantle everything the EPA and or Obama worked for. Being I am paying you why don't you get off your ass and do something about Flint Michigan.
You, sir, lie.
NO You LIE You Lie About him Lying which he Isnt
?
Keep up the good work @EPAScottPruitt and don't worry, We are working hard to rid California of crooks like @KamalaHarris !
RESIGN!! NOW!!
California and Governor Brown have a college educations and I 10 times smarter than you stay out we don’t need a guy who doesn’t believe in the EPA to be running it that is Idiocracy and you are the thief to taxpayers
Head of the EPA cannot protect the environment while in bed with energy companies.
Promoting your manipulated version of that message. Don’t get too comfy in your office. We’re working hard to oust your boss...you’ll go with him.
Shut it its NOT Up To You
Stop lying Mr. Pruitt. We all know you don't give two shits about the environment.
how can we have a strong economy when we continue to allow losers like Pruitt to continue to steal our money for their own personal uses??? It is time for you and your kind to step down Pruitt, we dont want you in office any longer and YOU ARE to pay back every single dime!!!
Yes, you can sir.  What have you done since you have been in Washington?  I know you are gutting any type of environmental protection you can  help  greedy, rich, white, old men can get richer.

Says the Buller
You are a bought and paid for con man- but everyone is on to your con.  Resign.
LIES!!!
Pruitt!!! #KamalaHarris Should be ARRESTED! For Making Death Threats against a Sitting President! She Threatened @Potus on The #EllenDeGeneresShow That is #Treason  @Cabinet @KellyannePolls @SecretaryZinke
#resign you #hypocrite
Resign
NOPE
No #TrueEnvironmentalist (or believer in a strong economy) would ignore #ClimateChange as you do.
#ClimateChange is a HOAX!!!
Wow! Would a true environmentalist support slashing the EPA budget so that dozens of climate change programs would be abolished? I THINK NOT! #BoyBye #BootPruitt
#ClimateChangeHOAX #LearnFacts
Aren't you attacking the state's car emission standards? Do you even know what the word "Environmental" means?
Pruitt, it's time for you to address nanoterrorism.

Are you in a position of authority? Be holy by working for the common good and renouncing personal gain. #GaudeteetExsultate

That is not your message, which has been coming across pretty clearly. You think that you run the Earnings Protection Agency. And you do that by lying about the science, like any dishonest creationist.
Just like I reject Scott’s claim that just because he’s rolling back regulations it does not by any means afford him 1st class air fair 2 Morocco & other luxuries a la the American taxpayer. Could have been a nice run 4 u Scott. Too bad no moral compass! Gone BY Memorial Day!!
Shut it #PollutingPruitt

#FirePruitt
Lord @SenKamalaHarris  !!!
Please save us from this moron! 
Is that why you have to travel with 30 bodyguards...because you are so committed to protecting the environment? So glad you & family don't need clean air & water & won't have children with neurological damage from toxic agricultural chemicals you approved. #VoteThemOut2018
That doesn’t mean attempting to renew a dying industry. It means accepting that the rest of the world is adapting to renewable energy sources and that we should be doing the same so that our businesses will be globally competitive.
Incompetence

WRONG!!!
I totally agree, Sen.Harris! You're a joke, Pruitt.

#BREAKING: Trump EPA to shut down office handling research on chemicals' effects on children's health http://hill.cm/8Vd58qR  
Please stop the pollution from coal. Why go backwards? Only to save $$ at the expense of our health.

i hope CA sues you to hell and back over the clean power plan

Promoting a "message" and taking action for the benefit of the environment are two different things https://www.salon.com/amp/how-scott-pruitts-epa-is-attacking-journalists-and-stifling-the-media_partner?__twitter_impression=true …

Attention EPA employees: if you are disciplined for using actual facts and science instead of Koch Brothers talking points regurgitated by the Administrator, I want to hear from you. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/03/29/the-energy-202-scott-pruitt-s-climate-message-is-now-official-epa-guidance/5abbfd3630fb042a378a2f23/?utm_term=.007a1e1f66dc …

Oh, Mr. Pruitt, this made me laugh.  You don't care about the environment.
@EPAScottPruitt is God going to protect the children from Asthma and Lung Diseases due to you deciding it is a wonderful thing to Pollute the air? #BootPruitt #cleanairnow
I think you’re confusing environmentalism with corporate protectionism.

This energy lobbyist’s firm reported $16 million in lobbying income last year alone - let that sink in. Obscene amounts of dark money continue to flow into lobbying that turns up in Trump’s pork laden bills like the recent omnibus and tax legislation. https://twitter.com/kfile/status/979380598660837376 …
Hey! Stop gaslighting people! You don't care about the environment, and you certainly don't care about public health! You're trying to poison people w/ #Chlorpyrifos to appease your industry masters, you sick Monster. #BootPruitt

When our descendants are scraping a living from the wasteland, I’m sure they’ll be grateful we saved the hydrocarbon industries.

Balancing the economy with environmental protection does NOT mean exploiting the environment; it means protecting the environment. It means creating green jobs and a green economy. GET A CLUE, PRUITT.
I find it laughable that you think you are promoting a strong environment. By repealing the Clean Power Plan? By going after California’s vehicle emissions standards? We aren’t fooled by you, Mr Pruitt.
Pruitt, you are not an educated administrator who understands what our environment needs. You are calling for increased emissions, enabling polluters and allowing dangerous chemicals. Gaslighting us won’t work.
Hilarious.

Oh Great! 

There goes the BUS-TUNEUP guy again!
Mr. Pruitt. STOP. You've just got to stop. @EPAblog  about protecting the environment. If you want to protect big business, go work for @CommerceGov. Not-a-one-of-us will miss you.
But you’ll trash the environment anyway right?

You are destroying, not protecting. You can't run our gov't like a business, you can't put an exploiter in charge of protecting what he exploits for money. I live in a superfund area because polluting companies choose profit and this photo shows what a "farmer" does without rules
Yes, it's common sense; something #dimrats lack via their brainwashing and/or corrupt nature.
Stop trying to sell our National Parks to corporate interests.
Let Trump take care of it. If liberals get involved nothing gets done.
You DO know they can still spit on your food in First Class, right?

Stop threatening human existence and maybe people will be a little nicer to you.

#ClimateChange #BootPruitt

RENEWABLE ENERGY!!!!!
Is it #AirPruitt or #PruittAir? 
We will all pay a massive price for your ignorance of #ClimateChange.
Lol. You are nothing but a killer doing the work of industry while harming people, animals, and places. You literally ARE causing the false choice by only acting on behalf of industries, and not human health or environments.
Ah, Pruitt. But you think Jesus wants you to blow up mountains for coal. So it's pretty clear that clean air and water is not on your list of priorities. Some of us wonder who will cause destruction of earth first- you, or Bolton?
Your tweet is a joke, right? Your only concern is to prop up dirty energy at the expense of the environment. You're an asshole for working toward the destruction of our planet with no regard for future generations.
Scott Pruitt’s “Dirty Dealings” Stir a Campaign to Oust Him From the EPA
By lessening the regulations that protect the environment?  You are a fraud! #globalwarming #climatechange
actually mr pruitt is happy to destroy both the economy and the environment, which is exactly what we see going on right now.
gaslighting. we are major world contributors to global warming and you are on the wrong side of history and threaten survival of life on earth. shame on you.
Not under this fake administration!
Are you also promoting your role in the world as a “geologist?”
Not with that jerk and Trump lap dog Pruitt in charge.
I think you and @SenKamalaHarris have differing ideas of what environmentalism means... if you really want to be pro environment then work towards ending this administrations obsesion with coal and oil
Why would you ever try to spend my tax dollars on trying to put religious statues on government property?
Are you out of your mind? Those tax dollars come from people of all denominations and Faith's and some that don't have any at all you have no right to use it for one religious  representation over others
Video: Scott Pruitt wants you to know he is gonna fight for religious statues to be on government property. #BootPruitt 
Pruitt, what are you going to do about the plastic in the oceans? It’s killing the wildlife!
When  @HealTheBay is not a fan of yours that means #California is not a big fan of yours . #blueskies #cleanair #sunshine and #ClimateChangeIsReal #protectourcoast and #BootPruitt is how we roll... #thanks #TedLieu
Prove it. So far you're not making the case!
While that may be true, the economy isn't, and shouldn't be the concern of the head of the EPA.
Bullshit, Scotty. Here’s some advice: don’t try your crap on Sen. Harris. She’s exponentially (look it up) smarter than you are.
Shhhhh
Do something about this moron!
Amen 
Climate change is real and man made
You're a corrupt disgrace as a steward for the environment AND taxpayers are angry you are abusing your office on OUR DIME. #ResignNOW
You need to resign!
Are you actually here? If so, GET OUT OF OUR STATE!!!!!
But you take the side of business rather than actually, you know, protecting the environment.
Facts, not Fear. THE RATIONAL OPTIMIST: HOW PROSPERITY EVOLVES. http://www.rationaloptimist.com 
Scotty.... baby. Ya gonna spend the rest of your time having people spit in your lunch. Why provoke more?
You are undoing all the positive progress that was being made. You are NOT a true environmentalist! You are a Koch Brothers shill.
Laughable. You are NOT an environmentalist.
Oh come on Pruitt, you can’t just type that glib reply when everything you have said and done to date has hurt the environment. It’s not even a clever hashtag. #fakeEnvironmentalism
Hey Kamala, An improvement in Ca. Environment can start with cleaning up the feces and the garbage off the streets.
pfffft
First ammendment 1 to the Constitution of the United States which reads: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."
Leave your religion out of our laws Pruitt!
They want you to either adopt their radical agenda, or they say you want dirty water. ...Just dishonest ppl.
You wouldn't know environmentalism if it bit you! You're a tool for corporate profiteers and big polluters. Sustainability is smart development and environmental stewardship that promotes resilience and protects resources. You are doing the exact opposite! #PollutingPruitt
Haha no one believes you.
Maintaining the Clean Water Rule for both navigable and non-navigable waterways would be a great place to start.
Everybody hates you Scott.
Do you need that secure telephone booth in your office to hide from the evil people trying to stop you from saving the environment?

Didn't think so.
Perhaps Kamala can join you on one of your luxury vacations on our dime!
Did you fly First Class? YOU ARE A PUBLIC SERVANT...if you wish to fly First Class, have the travel office book your ticket and then YOU upgrade at your own expense. That is what I do and I work for a gov contractor.
Pruitt travels to ITALY $120,000; $1,600 for 1st class seat Washington DC to NYC; military jet Cincinnati to JFK $36,000; trip to Morocco $68,000; 43 of 92 days spent going back & forth DC to Oklahoma - likely FIRST class. Cost of his SECRET trips - only GOD & Pruitt know.
suuuuuure scott

You're full of shit.
Yes, but you're a slimy fraud, so what you agree with has very little to do with actual reality. Resign.
Then why the rollback of so many enviro regulations?

Lol “strong environment,” what does gargamel know about this? Gargamel has no idea.
Then please see to it that pollution limits are enforced and that we continue to aggressively pursue the transition away from fossil fuels.
Build more nuclear plants in California. Increase water capacity at exising reservoirs. And build desalinization plants all along our coast.

Make California a net exporter of energy and clean water to the rest of the Western US. #CaliforniaGreatness
please go hide in your soundproof dome that you bought with $43,000 of taxpayer money until your pathetic President is voted out
.@EPAScottPruitt So happy to see your #trueenvironmentalism hashtag. I'm involved with a nature center. Part of our focus is showcasing the synergies that agriculture and the environment can achieve in harmony for common interests.
And Morocco was a really nice exotic vacation for you and your family on the taxpayers dime! Perhaps next trip you can take Kamala with you.

Oh, and celebrate #ManateeAppreciationDay too.
This song was recorded 3 years before your agency was founded. You have a duty to this country. Act like it.
Omg, where did you find this song? I remember singing it in elementary school and haven't heard it since!
It’s out there on YouTube. The pianist is Tom Lehrer. Pretty much all of his stuff is online and it’s all great.
Awesome, thanks! Finally, something good came out of Pruitt's twitter feed.
