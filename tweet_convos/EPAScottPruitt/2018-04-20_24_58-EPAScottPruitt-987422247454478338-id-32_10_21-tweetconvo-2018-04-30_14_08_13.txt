Since you’re tweeting it, you should rename it “Destroy The Earth Day” - shame on you for all you’re doing to take back all the environment friendly initiatives of the last 10 years.
RIGHT. You've rolled back so many protections, allowing filth to be spewed into the air and water, I don't know how you can even talk about EARTH DAY. #Hypocrite #Corrupt #DogTurd YOU ARE A DISGRACE and EMBARRASSMENT to Oklahoma - we do NOT want you. #ChokeOnYourPollution
"And for those of you who, like me, hate #EarthDay , I'll be hosting #AntiEarthDay with my good friend & new #EPA Deputy Admin Andy "King Coal" Wheeler at my new almost free DC crash pad, paid for with dollars I saved by selling the naming rights to EPA's hq to #Exxon!" -#Pruitt
Because you care about earth? You are working everyday to DESTROY our environment.
Do right by the Earth.. RESIGN!!
It's #EarthDay18!!!

It’s also #420 day, why don’t you smoke some weed Scott...It’s organic, mellow out and quit destroying our environment & wasting our tax dollars
