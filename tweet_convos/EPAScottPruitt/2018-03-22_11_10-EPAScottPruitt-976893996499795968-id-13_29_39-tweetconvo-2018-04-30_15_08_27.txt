So tell me, why is @EPAScottPruitt ing regs to protect our water? Oh yeah, that's right, #pollutingPruitt is busy padding the pockets of his buddies in big #oilandgas
Talk to us after Pruitt is no longer in charge.
Wouldn't it be great if the EPA actually still protected water resources?
Protecting the quality of that water is also important.  Or have you forgotten that's part of your mission?
What about preserving it's cleanliness for future generations? #climatechange #RenewableEnergy #BlueWave2018



Still in great need of relief from rank and file EPA and Corp on Waters of the US jurisdiction.  I believe they are ignoring @POTUS executive order on this issue.  Great news and excellent job @EPAScottPruitt .
Wasn't it just last week that you announced intentions to repeal federal clean water protections related to Coal Ash and now you're talking big for #WorldWaterDay? I know Salamanders of the P. glutinosus complex that aren't that slimy.
Get rid of Pruitt and so many problems that he has created by removing regs that simply allow big donors to rape the environment.  Yes, he is an environmental rapist and should be held accountable.  Fire Him Now! @POTUS
