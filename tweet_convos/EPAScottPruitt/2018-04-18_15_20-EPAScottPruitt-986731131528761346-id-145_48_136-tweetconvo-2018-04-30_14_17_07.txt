Corrupt polluter and his minions trashing the environment
You were such an embarrassment to the state of OK. You're a bigger embarrassment now. Not to mention you're just outright corrupt.
Sure is white in there.
You are a CORRUPT CRIMINAL abusing taxpayers dollars like we’re your personal piggy bank. You don’t even know where you’re working because YOU ARE NOT PROTECTING AMERICA. @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse #FirePruitt

You have a crush on Clinton, I see.
Resign.
@EPAScottPruitt has done the most to undermine peoples perception and trust in government. He is not mindful of the people, for the people. #BootPruitt
POS!

Why do they bother posting fluff like this? Pruitt is a corrupt deregulator currently under 9 different ethics-related investigations. He needs to go today! #BootPruitt #GoIG
Resign
Could you at least hire a few more fat, white guys? I feel like there needs to be more of these in the @EPA .
Hey Scott - How have you stolen from the American people today and how have you worked to destroy their planet?
LIES BY Omission! Read the ENTIRE report!!
Lying sack of sheet

Hey scott.
Then explain this

#PruittMustGo 
Pruitt is just another Trump Grifter
Time for Pruitt to go.
Today, I led a group of 39 senators and 131 representatives in calling on @EPAScottPruitt to step down. Our historic resolution sends an unequivocal message to the administration: the American people…
It’s time to resign.
170 members of Congress have introduced a resolution calling for Scott Pruitt’s resignation. https://www.scribd.com/document/376735298/Resolution-Calling-on-Resignation-of-EPA-Administrator-Scott-Pruitt …
You are the most disgusting example of a swamp dweller. VOTE DEMOCRATS!! TRumps not going to do anything so it’s up to the honorable Americans to get this pig out of office.
I wish you had as much zeal for clean water and clean air.
RESIGN!
I look forward to your actions against @TetraTech & complicit CA democrats for Greatest-Eco Fraud in History
We've got serious concern in FL with #Mosaic #phosphate mines. Please Act! #SaveOurWater
@StevePieczenik
#ThursdayThoughts why is @EPAScottPruitt still in office
So that phone booth- Amazon or Target?
Piece of shit
Shame on you.
@usaGov is not the problem, you are! Spending $43,000 of taxpayer funds to build a sound proof phone booth in your office. You & selfserving corps carving up our gr8 country's resources & destroying it. @McCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @LindseyGrahamSC @RandPaul @funder
And this as well
.@EPAScottPruitt you better pay back every freaking penny. In the mean time #PuertoRico has no clean water & no electricity.  #FireScottPruitt now & arrest him for misappropriation of Gov spending.

While Pruitt was in state govt, NY Times says a lobbyist sold him a home for $100k less than she had paid for. Her telecom employer paid the difference. He then voted to let the employer raise its rates. At EPA he hired her +…

I guess those bulletproof seat covers don't prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.
And the scandals just keep coming.
Pruitt is Incompetent unqualified unethical wasting taxpayers money.. just a quack and bad for America. He should be fired. @SenSchumer @RWPUSA @tedlieu @hardball @TGowdySC @RepSwalwell @maddow @KamalaHarris @NancyPelosi
I just paid my taxes. You can fly first class again.
This is your own quote.  “economic activity in the surrounding areas are fully protected.” Economic activity. When did the E switch from ENVIRONMENT to economic?  Wow.... pretty sad.  We need to clean up thoroughly not a rush job just to tic it off a list.  Sad . @Fight4Goodness
The corrupt fool is so busy wasting taxpayer money on unnecessary quiet rooms and batmobiles that he's too busy to listen to scientists. Cleanup is quick when 'clean' is defined politically, not scientifically.
Get OUT! #PruittTheGrifter
In just over a year you’ve accelerated greasing
the palms of oily corporate comrades so much that 
ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY members of Congress 
have signed a resolution calling on you to resign.
#FirePruitt #BootPruitt #PollutingPruitt #ThursdayThoughts #Trump

Get OUT!

Hot damn. LOL. Anyone with a modicum of dignity would be SHAMED into resigning by something like this. (Pruitt doesn't have dignity, so we're at an impasse) https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/986804096714919936 …
can u please post a photo of you in your $43K phone booth calling an oil industry lobbyist?? Please???

You're a Superfund site 
Compared to what u are costing taxpayers for ur outlandish administrative spending habits, ur overall performance is piddly. FYI - we've counted the silverware just in case ur eyeing it. #FlyCoachNoOneIsThatImportantIncludingYou
You belong in prison.
I highly doubt it.
202-564-4700 Call Pruitt and demand his resignation
Resign
You’re a con man and unworthy of your position.
Scott Pruitt believes his first class flights and secure phone booth are more worthy of protection than the environment. He doesn’t belong at the EPA and he doesn’t belong in government. Past time to #BootPruitt.

From @LFFriedman: A Guide to the Investigations Faced by Scott Pruitt, E.P.A. Chief https://nyti.ms/2JXysrs 
And you'll be out before this year is done. You slimy cunt!
Hmm.  Where do I sign to get my first class flight accommodations?
.@SenatorCollins  You notice how an awful lot of the people in power in DC are old, fat white men? BLUE WAVE coming.
Everybody’s coming after you from every direction. This is a good thing.
You still have a job?
Crook
#FirePruitt
In just over a year the EPA HAS SPENT HOW MUCH MONEY ON IT’S ADMINISTRATOR????????? Answer SCOTT!!!!!!

Hey Pruitt one quick question. I know ur busy stealing from the American taxpayer but I gotta ask. R U retarded ? Asking for a friend who doesn’t have Twitter. Thanks u POS pathetic moron.

Pruitt, more sell outs? Resign
Are you embarrassed that you are being investigated?
Mr. Pruitt, your soundproof phone booth cost more than I make in a year!  Please do the right thing and resign!
Keep up the great work Scott. The phoney letter sighned by Liberal senate and congress is bogus BS of swamp monsters.
White House Will Investigate Pruitt's $43,000 Phone Booth http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/AAw1Qq2?ocid=st …
Wow! So misleading or could we say lying?
You have reversed our gain on slowing pollution, stollen from the government and have been very competitive with trump on lies
BYE FELICIA
Whitest administration since Washington.
How's that sound proof corruption booth working out for you?
Liar liar pants on fire. You not only deserve to be fired, but I predict you’ll end up in a cell next to Slspoy in federal prison, where you BOTH can have as much unprotected sex as you want. Perhaps with each other? Why stop now?
Nothing but whiteys, and corrupt ones at that!

RESIGN -America
YOU ARE THE WORST!!! You thief! Get out of the White House.
Scott Pruitt, you ARE the greatest thing that has EVER happened to any government agency. Please hold classes for the remainder of the cabinet on draining the swamp and removing the activists from ALL agencies. Thank you!
Shame on you!! Activism = accountability
Did you invent a new remediation technology _ask somebody what that is, Scotty), or just lower the standard?
Anything else we can buy for you? How about a nice yacht? No self respecting public servant should be expected to settle for anything but the best our money can buy. Especially considering your hard job of destroying our environment for your personal gain. Just let us know.
https://a.msn.com/r/2/AAw22yU?m=en-us …

LATER!
Get out

One year - to just add Mississippi to list!!! Firing 13+ Scientists, firing other integral staff as toxins seep/spread into land and water throughout! Not getting ANYTHING environmentally done (except rollbacks) with less professional staff!
Rock on!!! Great work!!!
I’m going to guess there’s no “I’m swindling the American people and ruining the environment because I’m an idiot” mention in that memo?
Excellent work #ScottPruitt. Patriots are working with you all the way through to success, prosperity and real-world sustainability.
Is that #AirPruitt or #PruittAir?

Dude, stop
You have been sent by the regulation Gods, thank you for all your achievements Scott!
Thanks for the good laugh as you have done more to trash public health

Keep up the great work swampy!
.@EPAScottPruitt is under at least 7 separate federal investigations for misuse of taxpayer funds. He needs to be held accountable for the damage he’s doing to environmental enforcement. I’m joining 39 senators & 131 reps in calling on Pruitt to resign. #BootPruitt
how dare you
You are a piece of shit Pruitt. #corrupt #destroyingtheenvironment
