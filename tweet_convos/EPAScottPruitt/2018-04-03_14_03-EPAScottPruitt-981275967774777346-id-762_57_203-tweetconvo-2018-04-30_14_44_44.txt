PS - Didn't think an individual that sued the EPA should direct the EPA.  And from the State of Oklahoma, which has has so many earthquakes they had to stop shale drilling. Plus u reject science/climate change and u had 4 staff in the environmental office for State of Oklahoma.
Our deepest apologies from Oklahoma for producing this spray fart of a man.
Ya did a job to Oklahoma before he now runs the EPA which he ia trying ro destroy. Awesome man!

Did you resign yet?

In 2011 Pruitt bought a property days before a court ruled it'd been fraudulently transferred by a developer on the hook for a $3.6M loan default. He flipped it for a $70K profit 4 months later to a dummy corporation set up by a major campaign contributor. https://www.salon.com/2018/04/05/exclusive-scott-pruitt-trumps-epa-chief-involved-in-shady-2011-real-estate-deal/ …

My hunch is one of those females who got the big bonus (money that was supposed to be used for clean drinking water) is going to be outed as his girlfriend.   #PruittMustGo
Me too!  Why else would she be traveling with him and she wasn't working at the time?  So we paying for Pruett's poon tang
Lol

He Says he didnt know about it. I guess he'd be stupid then, but who believes that lie! 
I look forward to the next administration giving the public a detailed list of the ways you failed the people of the United States. Your soundproof phone booth won't help you in the future. #BootPruitt
You still here? Vanish.

Your days as head of the EPA are numbered, Crooked Scotty, and soon  you'll be back among the general public enduring their taunts without  benefit of a security detail or a private plane.
He’s gonna look so cute in handcuffs.

Oof, a firing would be even better. It is Fire ‘em Friday after all

I'm not sure that being praised as a public servant to an agency promoting environmental protection is a big deal when the person doing the praising is a servant to big polluters who is dead set on destroying the agency he gave 38 years of his life to support.
Corrupt.
What pretty much all the previous comments say.
Stop wasting our money!!!!!
Resign
Pruitt’s spending habits aren’t the only thing raising serious questions. Pruitt and his agency are drowning in ethical questions, and the details of his below-market “lease” are only making his problems worse.

Let's see if you can stay in DC for $50 a night after you're kicked to the curb!
I saw a sofa bed in a living room on Airbnb Washington DC for $48 a night.
A true public servant, eh? By whose standards? Yours? Guards! Pat down this man on his way out the door. You'll find his pockets filled with office supplies & whatnots! #FirePruitt

I looked on Trivago. The cheapest room in Washington is a youth hostel with bunkbeds at $81 a night. The $50 room Scott Pruitt got was a bribe from an energy lobbyist. Need your pipeline approved? Do it through…

Hi tiny.
A few things. 
1. You're not that important to have a 20 person full time security detail. Is this an attempt to look big?

WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE A JOB
Hey @EPAScottPruitt Scott I am planning a trip to Washington DC later this spring. I am looking for a place to stay that is around 50$ a night. I haven't had any luck on Expedia yet, any suggestions or recommendations would be appreciated? Thanks!
Keep at it Mr. Pruitt. Don’t let the SOB’s get you down. You are doing a fantastic job!
No, he's not. He's not even trying to do his job properly.

Administrator Pruitt, America is behind you and we support you 100%. We understand the left wing agenda is trying to disrupt your progress....just keep going!

The latest outrage from Scott Pruitt and the EPA threatens us all and will ultimately damage our domestic car industry. Denying truth and science doesn’t make them any less true, Mr. Pruitt. https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/climate/trump-auto-emissions-rules.html …
Scott Pruitt can’t even run the EPA into the ground without screwing it up. Sad!
Hopefully you're next, you corrupt, money grubbing, whiny asshole. I'm a taxpayer and I want a fucking refund for you.

The man pled guilty to collusion with Russia. The fact that he is not in prison is truly stunning. Keep it up, maybe you two can be cell mates. #Resign #FirePruitt
Someone forgot to bring @EPAScottPruitt his step stool. He can barely see over that podium.

Chlorpyrifos hurts the brain and lowers IQ, especially in kids, who also experience tremors due to the chemical. It's been linked to everything from cancer to Parkinson's.

NOBODY expects anything good of you.

Scoop: Top EPA officials have discovered an email in which Sarah Greenwalt says, explicitly, that Pruitt approved her $56k-plus raise—despite his claim that he had no knowledge.

You got your cone of silence & took your girlfriend to Paris & Morocco, but we need an explanation why you need 20 people on this trip to Morocco to talk about natural gas? What is OUR EPA doing in another county to discuss something that has NOTHING to do with the environment?
Hey, remember when you were only making $39k a year and somehow magically got a loan for $11min to buy a minor league baseball team?  We do!  Your corruption spans YEARS and you’re going down!
Dang, a lot of people DO hate you, sweet!
U.S. taxpayers paid $2,460 to fix a door in a lobbyist home Pruitt was sleeping in during the middle of the day.  Why were you sleeping in a lobbyist home when you were supposed to be working?
# replace EPA ScottPruitt!
Still got a house in Oklahoma? You’re gonna be needing it soon.
Is there a job open because I would like to get paid while I stay home, go on trips to Morocco in first class and get $50,000 raises. Any other perks available? I hear you are connected to some low cost housing too?

It’s time we issue an eviction notice, change the locks, and kick out Scott Pruitt from the EPA.

I'm calling for him to resign immediately.
