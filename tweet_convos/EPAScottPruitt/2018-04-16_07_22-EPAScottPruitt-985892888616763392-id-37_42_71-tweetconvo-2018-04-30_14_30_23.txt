Flint, MI #fixit
Fraud. @EPAScottPruitt dismantling clean air and water regs as fast as he can all while spending lavishly on himself. 1st class fraud.

This from an agency run by @EPAScottPruitt who is committed to  over health of our &.  Wondering if private well includes those affected by fracking. #pollutingPruitt

JUST IN: Federal investigation reveals Pruitt's $43,000 soundproof booth violated law http://hill.cm/xmmRjKD  
Small? Fresh, clean water is LIFE. Best you resign today and no later than 5 p.m. est  boomer Sooner Scott.
I wonder if he realizes that clapper wont budge without a wrench, and that he is missing his PPE...
How is it going with providing lead-free water in Flint?
Protect them from @EPAScottPruitt !?
THis is a good thing.  I can’t even take a shit at @EPAScottPruitt on this one.
Doesn’t do enough, your boss is still a crook.
25.4 million? That's barely enough. My water in Beecher City Illinois has been intermittently brown, coming from the tap for a few years now. I spend quite a lot of money on bottled water now, even though the village water bills keep going up in price. Thanks for nothing EPA.
@EPAScottPruitt reminds me of Dr Evil, although Pruitt is not an evil genius - JUST EVIL.

Private well owners?
#RESIGN
Thank you!  #WWT #LivingWell #cleanwaterforall
You guys gonna help those whose wells have been destroyed from Mariner 2 drilling in PA?  Sunoco doesn’t give a shit what they destroy.

What does it do to protect our water from your leering pipelines?
Wow #PublicEnemyNo1 Scott Pruitt spend 7¢ per American for water.
Bye bye Scott!
Breaking law with your private booth? Republicans are so corrupt
The $25.4M you list shows $8.1M listed twice for the same project, may need to edit your article to show whether you're spending $16.2M on one, or if that $8.1M is going someplace else?  We well owners want to know...

According to the Rasmussen poll, which was released last week, just 46 percent of likely U.S. voters believe Mueller’s investigation is “an honest attempt to determine criminal wrongdoing.”
Cheap rentals Call Scott at the #Swamp
@EPAScottPruitt He's a crook.
You mean @EPAScottPruitt didn't grab that #25M for a much needed trip to Paris and Morocco with a dozen staffers and 34 security people? Oh wait, that's next month's field trip. And don't even start with his earth-killing nihilism.
Word!
