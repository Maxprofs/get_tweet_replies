This is bullshit. I’m going to live somewhere with cleaner air: like China.
Want to address Flint MI and their water CRISIS that so far you have ignored? #FlintWater
Talk to Gina McCarthy, it was on her watch.
You absolute ignoramus!
When has government ever been "efficient & cost-effective"?
Transparency meaning you won’t see any real science!#petropruitt

RESIGN!
POS human.  Go drink Flint water.
@SarahPribis where is HQ filmed?
Soho, NYC
Thank you for enduring the hatred of the radical Marxist left, and restoring sanity to the EPA.
Things I don't like (partial list):
1. Nazis
2. Marxism
3. Toxic crap that can kill me (even slowly) in my air or water.

Pruitt developed a habit of allowing the third thing up there. That's bad.
Nothing you ever do is efficient & cost effective. The US is not the Philippines. You'll be gone soon, cheap crook.
Transparent - like our air used to be until Criminal Pruitt deregulated the polluters
You are a crook and an embarrassment - go watch your interview with Ed Henry - hopefully, you'll be thrown out with Trump and better yet charges against you
Thanks for the sanity on this NO2 issue.  I saw EPA deny a small (56,000 hp) Gas Turbine a more efficient and much lower NOx (42 to 5 ppmvd) rebuild because they wanted a 3.5ppm SCR addition for about $9 mil lifecycle cost. Grandfathered unit at 42ppm now, great job Obama EPA!
Can you recommend anywhere to stay when I'm in DC next month? I have a budget of $50 a night - I realize it's not a lot, but I gather it can be done if u know the right ppl...
You do not support science, only when it MIGHT support policy
It would be interesting to hear you describe the scientific method. Or to hear Trump explain, well, anything.
Thisbsblutterly a screen shot of his press release.  Nothing about air or water ... just jobs...
So you want to starve to death while taking your last breath of immaculate air?
Bravo!  Changes need to be incorporated in a new #CleanAirAct.  Otherwise next administration can just reverse again.  And changes can be made even better through statutory simplification and modernization.
@DavidSchoenbrod @AAPCA_States @SeanatGreenwire @rbravender @InsideEPA @HouseCommerce @EPWGOP
Transparent Science YEAH there’s a concept YOU HAVE NO F#%KING CLUE ABOUT!!!!!!
Transparent? You have no clue what that means. Are you one of the bureaucratic parasies, grifters, or rent seekers Pruitt is pruning away from the corrupt EPA?
Get rid of DEF on consumer diesel trucks, iv been stuck with the same truck for over 10 years. I will not buy one with DEF or any sort of EGR valve. Not to minchin 10+k to the cost of new trucks.

Congress is expanding its investigation into Scott Pruitt’s alleged spending abuses. The House is requesting interviews with several EPA officials.

Get lost u r a joke and just go under your “cone of silence “ and be quiet
Not only are you wasting tax payers monies on your BS trips, which is waste fraud and abuse, but you are killing the environment by rolling back regulations.  I’m sure there is a special circle in hell you will be spending your life! #WasteFraudAbuse
Keep setting us free!

"According to three people familiar with events, Pruitt would not take out the trash during his time staying at the townhouse believing that a cleaning service would do it for him. There was no cleaning service that came with the apartment, however. And the garbage bags piled up" …
Great job Scott Pruitt.
Resign.  I would call you pond scum, but pond scum is better for the environment.
Stop spending taxpayers money!! Clear the swamp!
You are an empty suit and too cheap to pay your way .
Look at the figures, we dare polluting much more than we were 2 years ago. You lie
Dont worry in a couple years we will change all this back and you will be in jail with colonel trump and some CEO'S that support this.
Hey dipshit, do u have a video of Donnie & Ivanka? You have something because you r not qualified for ur job. OU SUX DONKEY BALLS.
Please explain the cost-effectiveness of 1st class air travel on my tax dime
Doesn’t corrupt @EPAScottPruitt get the hint that EVERYONE recognizes him as a fraud?
Albeit costly, I'm with Calif. Congressman Eric Lieu in that we need to keep Pruitt as sentinel example of Trump's corruption.
Former EPA Aide Accuses Scott Pruitt Of 'Unethical, Potentially Illegal' Behavior
Translates to let’s take us back 50 years.
Talking about ethics and transparencies. You and your bosses need to get the meaning and resign. Shame on you deceivers, taking undue advantage of the peoples ignorance.
Shut up
Your punishment in hell will be strapped to the top of a smoke stack forced to drink Flint's water right out of the tap for eternity.
@labdrive2 B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T !!!
You don’t even bother to try and use semantics anymore.  This is literally a screen grab from your release. Nothing about protecting. Air or water just jobs!?
You poison our world, you criminal.

What absolute drivel - it does nothing of the kind.
It allows you to keep greasing the palms of your poisonous, oily corporate comrades. I hope you & @SecretaryZinke are prosecuted for crimes against nature.

Thank you for taking efficient & cost-effective measures.  Please implement the technology of organic waste to energy to eliminate all the plastic & sewage garbages
... at $50 a night ..
You shouldn't talk to us. Ever. Resign and go away. You're part of this cancer that's invaded this country.
“Transparent science”. What the fuck is that?
You corrupt son of a bitch. You have not protected the environment. You have abused the authority you have been given. It’s time to kick your ass back to Oklahoma. #BootPruitt
I pay you $50 Dollar when you drink a Gallon of Flint water. You can stay then another night in the room you used before. Since they keep saying there is nothing wrong with the Flint water, shouldn`t be a problem then, right.

“Find me something to do,” were the instructions Scott Pruitt gave his staff, after telling them he wanted to travel to particular destinations, the letter says https://nyti.ms/2HwCXbk 
Yeah, spewing crap indiscriminately, you can hire people to work in those conditions while the crap settles on their homes and water.
See: Crossett, Oklahoma, Koch Brothers. What a coincidence.
YOU WERE THE OKLAHOMA ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THE TIME.
Slimeball.
@BobSMueller will find out about this @TransCanadaJobs #pipeline and #Saudi #Deals. That's why gas keeps increasing 5 cents every week. Just don't have time right now For next chess moves
#ThursdayThought or I'm Crazy rabbit Trix are for kids #NeverForget
Can you ensure that you will be efficient and cost effective when flying, security detail, pay raises, sound proof room, etc.?  My tax dollars at work!
Dude, which credit card is best for free air miles? Asking for a friend.
Apparently the only reason that @EPAScottPruitt hasn't yet been fired is that he is @potus' "most effective" vile henchman. He will be remembered as #EnvironmentalEichmann.
Speaking of vile, your witless whing is just that vile.
Resign. Stop destroying the environment. You are the worst.
Surprised you know the meaning of the words “transparent “ and “science” #Time2Resign
Please tell me this includes aerial spray. 

We'll finally see an end to chem trails? @OpChemtrails
Chemtrails? Really?
Keep working hard Scott!  Thank you for all you are doing to #MAGA! You are certainly an asset to this administration.
Not an asset to the environment though
You are poisoning us. Who else bought you off?#grifter
#PruittMustGo #TrympGrifters
Lord knows I only want to breathe clean air if it's affordable for companies to abide by EPA rules.
Doing a fine Job Mr Pruitt , keep up the good work.

What does Putin winking at Gay Obama have to do with it?
Scott you should be fired after you pulled this CRAP!!! 1. Rented a Room from an Energy Lobbyist. 2. Raised 2 Aides' salaries AFTER the @WhiteHouse DECLINED the request. 3. Asked Security to use Sirens to cut through traffic?? As a retired EMT I find that disgusting...
How about resigning?! That would be cost-effective!
Cost effective? At what point did the @EPA begin lobbying for oil and gas? Oh right, you always been that way: A corrupt puppet who knowingly destroys the environment from the Agency that helped STOP FLAMING LAKES. Can’t wait to see what you do next!
Congrats on week 2 as the biggest embarrassment of the administration!
Haha you didn’t come near writing this tweet.
YOU'RE A CROOK. GET OUT
