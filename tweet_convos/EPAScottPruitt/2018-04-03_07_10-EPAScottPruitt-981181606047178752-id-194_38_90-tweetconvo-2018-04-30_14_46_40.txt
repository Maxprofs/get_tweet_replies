When ur rotting in prison for various corruption charges, know this: you will have accomplished NOTHING. You will be forgotten. The Myth of Scott Pruitt’s EPA Rollback https://politi.co/2GFhvUw  via @politicomag
Two things humans require to live: clean air and clean water. You have one job: ensure clean air and clean water. But no, you're too corrupt to do your job. #ResignNow
It's not your job to make auto makers money, it's your job to keep the environment clear. You know you have to to breathe the same air and drink the same water as the rest of us, don't you? You're killing your own children and grandchildren along with ours.

This guy....

No thanks. Well watch when @EPAScottPruitt leaves!
Did you announce to resign out of embarrassment, @EPAScottPruitt ? I would have tuned in. Do you know any other EPA rep whose landlord had to change the locks because they are 'late' paying a laughable $50 rent ?
Pruitt is now the dumbest Oakie alive.
The EPA has recently said that they are concerned with “secret science” and data not being shown properly in the public...and then decided to change the rules on emissions without providing any data or evidence or studies that said it was safe to do so. Response, EPA?
Response? Did you remember to provide an appropriate bribe to the Administrator before you asked your question? No? Be off with you, then.
IDIOTS!  We need STRONGER fuel emission requirements.  This IS NOT PROTECTING the environment.  This is DESTRUCTION of the environment.  STOP the DESTRUCTION and CORRUPTION NOW!
 Absolute BS.
Is your soul dying with every tweet? It should be.
You're in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, not the Environmental Pollution Agency! You're literally doing the opposite of your job.
So, you're saying he is a perfect Trump appointee?
@EPAScottPruitt  #ResignNOW
#LockHimUp
Absolutely nothing wrong with new cars today! If it aint broke, dont fix it!! Its not your job to help car companies make money! Or is it! Hmmm...   
#NaziBitches

New auto emissions! In @EPAScottPruitt words: making automobiles dirty again! Rolling back Obama regulations, cause Pruitt and @realDonaldTrump hate Obama, hate the environment, only care about making the polluting companies more money! We’re doomed!
Deeply wrong. The EPA should protect the environment, not car company profits and obnoxious self-centered consumers who just don’t give a damn.
#FirePruitt #FirePruitt #FirePruitt
#LIAR !!! #RESIGN !!! #CORRUPTION #ABUSEofTAXPAYERMoney #LIAR !!!
The car manufacturers agreed to the higher standards under Obama. Pruitt is a corrupt oil company shill.
It is SO OBVIOUS too.  They care NOTHING for environmental or citizen health.  ONLY care about health of the Oil industry.  #FirePruitt  NOW!
Yeah, I’m about to buy an electric car. So fu!
U Are going to be a regular ole citizen real soon.  You can surround ur self with lead paint chips, un-safe drinking water and bathe in an oil spill for as long as u want.  #countdown

Why don't you and your Oil Daddies roll back everything the ""Black Man Obama"" has done for our country?? Your other daddy tRump is doing the same. I think you are all russian spies.
#FirePruittNow
EPA official Samantha Dravis has resigned.

This news comes days after a Democratic senator asked for a review by the EPA inspector general of Dravis' time and attendance, "including an investigation of potential fraud committed" by Dravis.
No. No. No.
SWAMPER
Another idiotic move to destroy human health!  You should be fired for your incompetence!!!!!!!

Sources tell CBS News that, last year, Scott Pruitt wanted to use his vehicle's lights/sirens in D.C. traffic, but the lead agent in charge of his security detail said no. Less than 2 weeks later, that agent was removed from Pruitt's detail and reassigned.
…
"nearly 90 percent of respondents in a new Consumer Reports poll say that automakers should continue to improve fuel economy for all vehicles, and they overwhelmingly support stricter government-mandated mileage requirements."
"Respondents?" Those would be the common people, right? Probably not a billionaire among them. You can't expect an important man like Scott Pruitt to pay attention to the whims of such rabble. Now, go away so the Administrator can take a "nap."
This is NOT the time of the EPA. Pruitt is the worst official in the corrupt trump administration.
Well, don’t forget Betsy Devos. She is clueless.
Yeah. Worst official in the Trump administration is a pretty serious charge. There are some very strong contenders in that field. Pruitt is nightmarishly horrific, and his policies will devastate the earth for centuries to come, but he still has stiff competition.
He's the worst because he's the most competent and organized in execution. @BetsyDeVosED doesn't rise to that level. @SecretaryZinke is pretty bad. Sessions is.



Obviously your not listening to Americans because we would rather have our children have clean air to breathe!
How is that idiot still the head of the EPA? Someone sue him for embezzlement already
This pos sock puppet doesn’t need to be told that we want clean air and water as well as more fuel efficient vehicles. He doesn’t need to be told that selling our country out to big O&G and the Auto manufacturers is wrong. He KNOWS. That’s why the security...
just rename your agency while that cheating scum Pruitt "leads" you - call it for what it is now, a corporate shill unconcerned with the environment
No
Trump, fire Scott Pruitt, Ben Carson and yourself, P...L...E...A...S...E put the Country first.  Many thanks!
Pruitt on new auto emissions rules.  Nah, he is as clueless about the EPA as Trump is about the Presidency.  Neither of these morons gives a hoot about the environment or the people of the Country.  Their expertise is in corruption using gov. offices for personal gain. Liars!
Pruitt is lurking around (when he's not spending $40K taxpayers money on trip to Morocco with 30 personnel) for Sessions ouster. Another  DT "good man" ... you know,  the "Sewer" type.  Pruitt sold his soul at auction ages ago.  $50/mo DC Condo.  What's next?
Better get busy working on your resume. Murderer and liar. Who else will hire you?

Sure, let's go back to the 1960's when the sky was black with smog! But - IRL in 2018, Can't wait till you go to prison for your lack of ethics, failure to do your job & your #earthcrimes against humanity.
No. America does not want these cars. Just ask us.
Americans don’t want autos that will increase air pollution and get worse MPG. However, I am sure the oil industry would love this idea!

Trump and his EPA are going to trash the environment and make you spend more money on gas. Tired of winning yet?

@EPAScottPruitt  You're a moron. Who doesn't want a car that gets better gas mileage? Your enslavement to the fossil fuel industry is laughably transparent.
Growing up in smog ridden California, I appreciate our emission control. My grandchildren can run and play outside without their lungs burning. I would like to keep it that way. #pollution #environment #californiaemissions
Didn't allow media in the room during announcement because he is a lying thieving coward. He knows what he is doing is wrong.
Watch right here as Pruitt sells his soul and our children’s health!!
The car Americans want doesn't pit smog in the atmosphere. Zero emissions is the goal
@EPAScottPruitt , shut up
Your shtick isn’t working. We know you are an energy industry shill who is selling out the environment. $50 a night? That’s just bullshit.
Morons. At least @EPAScottPruitt won’t be employed by the EPA much longer, if that makes anyone with an ounce of logical reasoning feel any better.
Grifter
BS!
I didn’t know that Environmental Protection Agency meant you were here to help car manufacturers make more money?
and as long as he can fill his own pockets, he considers it  a win
Let's end the kakistocracy & #BootPruitt once and for all!
We demand that Scott Pruitt resign as head of the EPA http://petitions.moveon.org/s/eK81O=  @moveon
Help get @EPAScottPruitt out of office by signing on to this quick & easy petition everyone!

#PruittMustGo
I’m fine with what we have in ca and it’s my understanding the auto companies are too
How about making rules that protect the environment? That is your job!
The EPA should be pushing for American innovation to lead the world in fuel efficiency instead of applauding dumbed-down measures.
There is nothing about the environment in that tweet. You freaking work for the environmental protection agency and there is nothing about protecting the environment in this.
The ONE person who shouldnt be the head of the EPA is. Your name should really be SATAN.
The mission of the EPA is to protect human  health and the environment as per the website.  You are doing exactly the opposite.  Still can’t figure out how you people sleep at night.
Hmm, I’ll buy a Big 3 vehicle when they actually make one that’s worth owning! They use cheap materials, break and rust. I’ll keep buying foreign thank you!
I'll watch the press conference when you're fired, thanks. #corruptpruitt
There’s the door. Walk through it. Don’t come back.
Do you even know what the EPA stands for?  You are a joke.
Americans want cars that get good gas mileage.
Who wants to pay more often for gas?
this low life pruitt has damaged the environment with his policies and rollback of regulations that we may never be able to fix. pruitt wants the world to be destroyed so he and his fellow the cockroaches will be the only ones left
Enough of your high maintenance drain the swamp resign secretary Pruitt... this is your shame
Resign secretary Pruitt it’s the right thing to do ...drain the swamp
Watch here as Scott Pruitt continues to destroy the planet, whilst lining his own pockets.
Scott Pruitt is corrupt and needs to resign immediately. #BootPruitt #PruittMustResign
Pruitt is literally in bed with big oil, at $50 a night, he gets cheap bedding from the people he is supposed to regulate.

Let me think. What causes a person to "nap" so deeply that his security detail trying to wake him calls an ambulance?
You f-ing crook. The condo deal, misdirecting funds for clean water and your charter flights are a punch in the face to the American people. You should resign and I will make every effort to call attention to you and demand you are fired.
When you have no character, no moral compass, no soul, these are the headlines you make: EPA Reportedly Approved Pipeline Project Linked To Lobbyist Renting Room To Pruitt
All you seem to do is to roll back regulations in order to benefit your business colleagues. Your job is to protect our environment.
You should be having a press conference to announce your #resignation. #grifter
Cars didn't get more expensive under the previous rules. This isn't about American consumers. This is about the oil industry, Scott.
How does reducing emission standards PROTECT the ENVIRONMENT?
Resign now you environmental terrorist and self declared elite entitlement taker
EPA Moves To Weaken Landmark Fuel Efficiency Rules https://n.pr/2GNpz4H   Listen to debate. This is a bad decision by Pruitt. #BootPruitt
Jessica Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at Edmunds, said in a statement that flexibility will come with a cost. "The unfortunate reality is that this decision comes with a logistical nightmare in the short term,"
If you like dirty air, which it appears that you do, MOVE TO HANOI.
Kill the Auto industry if it doesn't produce efficient clean cars
And until they do bend to the will of the people buy foreign if their standards meet the Paris Accord
Time to leave grifter. Giving raises to employees rejected earlier by PPO is a no-no. You stuck your neck out. It’s going to be chopped off. You are corrupt. Just like your boss. You’re just like his kids.
The Auto industry cannot sell a vehicle in the state of California unless it meets California's clean air standards they will follow our lead I suggest all states do the same stringent regulations Pruitt is a sell-out to the Auto industry and oil corporations
What a tragedy for our country! The @EPA no longer protects our environment.
Wow.  Sounds like you're working for the auto industry.  Just the opposite of what the head of the EPA should be doing!
I looked back at your texts.
Must frustrate you that no one answers your tweets
I will

There is a black hole where Pruitt's conscience should be
Every reply here is pointing to the fact that you are soulless corporate shills. Have a response or are you too afraid?
What an utter load of horsesht. The EPA exists to PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, not make $ for car companies. PLUS, this raises consumer costs in the long run, & will mean more $ spent on gas & oil. Tighter emissions & fuel efficiency rules are economic wins, & better for us & earth
What Americans are you putting first? American Motors? Slime!

Wow EPA focuses on: cars we want, cost, technology & safety but not effect on the environment of regulation change? #protectthe environment
Shame! Pruitt is a stain on our environment, ethics and The Constitution. #BootPruitt #owned #unfit #FederalPrison #CORRUPTION @POTUS
Just another  @EPAScottPruitt giveaway to the O&G industry. He's nothing more than a well-paid lobbyist.
Just resign. You don’t believe in science and you are corrupt. #EPA #trump #Pruitt #sciencematters
No you’re killing the environment and allowing the lobbyist that pay for your trips and lifestyle make more money, you’re a monkey for oil and auto manufacturers
You have lost sight of your mission. You should be forcing the auto industry to protect the environment, just as your name suggests.
While ya at it. Do away with this poison... it’s expensive. Uncalled for
Pruitt .....
I'm not a lawyer like you @EPAScottPruitt but pretty sure this means jail time.
Hey @AGMikeHunter you're in the @NYDailyNews !
Need to release the rest of Scott Pruitt's emails!  They are public record under OK state law!
CRIMINAL POS
Except in California and 12 other states.
Why are you promoting safety of newer cars?  I mean it's important, but literally NOT YOUR DEPARTMENT!  @NHTSAgov 
BTW, I'm American and I want cars with low, or zero, emissions.
Exactly!  @EPAScottPruitt Stay. In. Your. Damn. Lane. 

#PruittPaidOff
Doesn’t seem you are interested in protecting the environment just big business! Good luck trying to get CA to change! Are you enjoying spending tax payer money to live the big life! You are the worst!
You need to be fired! You are going to make the USA another China where we will need a mask to breath the air! You will be gone...America is not going to put up with your polluting our country!
RESIGN YOU ASSHOILE!!!
No one with an ounce of sense listens to Pruitt. He'll be the next one to be fired anyway. Bye Felicia!
Hey stupid, you job is to protect the environment, not the auto industry.
$50-a-night @EPAScottPruitt ... Jesus, man, you will surely be punished by the Angels who have sway mattes of truth.
I'm guessing your little event wasn't at @PohankaChevy in Chantilly, VA.  
I'll bet they get an increase in sales of fuel efficient cars and trucks!
How about we stock his office with Flint Michigan tap water.
Hmmmm... sounds good for the car makers. 
Didn't hear anything about "protecting the environment" tho...
@EPAScottPruitt your job is to PROTECT the environment, not sell our clean air to the highest bidder.
#ProtectOurEnvironment #CleanAirMatters #PruittMustGo
We want cars with higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions. These are essential. Don’t roll back the standards.
#DumpRenewableFuelAct #DumpEthanol
You are one of the biggest crooks in the White House. Hope there is a prison term in your future.
I will not buy any of these cars if they roll back to YOUR Unhealthy standards!
It would be better if the unethical, incompetent, ignorant imp used this opportunity to discuss his resignation. 
#BootPruitt
There is nothing more American then hating you Scott Pruitt. Pray there is never a revolution because you will be jailed or hung
This is simply to please his oil buddies and get their cash when he tries to run for office. There is nothing 'protective' about the EPA anymore.
You disgust me.
We want clean air and water and we want your corrupt self to resign .
Disgraceful.
Finally a director that’s got common sense



This tweet should list your title as... Liquefied Natural Gas Salesman Pruitt..
@realDonaldTrump
You are supposed to work for the American consumer, not corporations. As long as we can access information, you will not turn America back to the days when greedy corporations fooled the public. Come into the 21st Century @EPAScottPruitt Dump Pruitt!
Sponsored by Ford.
$1 Trillion is the estimated cost to consumers with your proposed roll back of an agreement between car makers and the previous administration. $ 1 Trillion in fuel savings down the drain, plus the # 1 source of pollution and carbon in our air. You are corrupt.
But that's $1 Trillion back in Big Oils pocket
Would be a good idea for auto companies to keep making fuel efficient cars that minimize pollutants.  When we get an EPA chief who isn't paid off by industries they will have a lot of catch up.
There's a market for opioids too. Doesn't mean deregulating is smart. Scott Pruitt has one goal... Increase profits for the energy industry.
What about the CLEAN AIR that we must breathe in order to live to buy the cars?
LIES LIES nothing but lies from the crooked EPA Pruitt
Terrible plan. Destroys American competitiveness and environment. 

Pure idiocy from sold out fools and shills.
Sad @EPA you have fallen from your place in America as our protector of health, land, air and water. Sad you haven't #resist @ScottPruittOK  #BootPruitt
Stop making new tweets to bury previous comments. Or at least read those comments and put your heads together to understand them good.
Background soundtrack - accompanying chorus of "boos" representing the 70% of Americans who think this is a horrible idea
