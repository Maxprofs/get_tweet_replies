And did you listen to what Shultz said about climate change? He doesn't agree with you at all.
Pruitt must GO. When it comes to technical qualifications he has NONE. There are thousands of people more qualified than a trumpian swamp dweller.
Scott Pruitt's Environmental Protection Agency Doesn't Give a Single Damn About the Environment
GREEDY OIL PEOPLE GOING DOWN!!  WIND AND SOLAR ARE IN!
Buddy, you know and care about the environment as much as your boss knows and cares about fidelity. Easter Sunday, the hypocrisy is high.
Really, did you talk about the environment!
Afternoon @ScottPruittOK, I don't suppose you feel like a chat about #climatechange & the involved #methodology? Curious, do you acknowledge that we are basically #subspecies #mammal homo sapiens sapiens #primate? Re's D #peace - #Education #Ecology101
#ResignNOW
NEW: Scott Pruitt was stuck in traffic. He wanted to use lights/sirens to get to his official appointment, but the lead agent advised him that sirens were to be used only in emergencies. Less than 2 weeks later that agent was removed from Pruitt's detail.
NEW Death of activist found in DC hotel swimming pool hours before testifying regarding engineered mosquitos. Keep all the security you need!! God bless.
It’s too bad you NOTHING about preserving the environment! You’ve been appointed to a post about which you know nothing! DISGRACEFUL!!
Resign
You can’t do whatever you want with OUR money! #Resign #DrainTheSwamp
You're the head of the EPA. If you go to Stanford, it should be to talk to their CLIMATE SCIENTISTS.
George Shultz actually has a very reasonable position on climate change, so I hope Pruitt listened.
Quick question Scott how did you manage to buy a $500k home in Tulsa on an annual AG salary of $132k?
RESIGN!
Yes PRUITT RESIGN!!!!
When ur rotting in prison for various corruption charges, know this: you will have accomplished NOTHING. You will be forgotten. The Myth of Scott Pruitt’s EPA Rollback https://politi.co/2GFhvUw  via @politicomag
Livin’ high on that government pig, eh?
Do you ever do your job and meet with the actual scientists that work @EPA ? Or just hide in your soundproof box calling chemical companies?
He won't answer you so I will: no.
Resign already!
Was that another meeting about destroying the environment so more Americans will die from the pollution. Go suck some chemicals!

Your extreme de-regulation is sick and corrupt and clueless
Tax payers ARE NOT your personal vacation funders. You are a thief and embezzling $$$ from US citizens—#FireScottPruitt
No you didn’t. If you want a robust dialogue you’d meet environmentalists once a year rather than hanging out at conservative “think” tanks.
Scott, follow the POTUS tweets carefully. Guess is that you’re the next to leave via twitter.  Could be Dr Carson or perhaps both of you. Not SAD! In thoughts and prayers.
Stop spending my money, my tax money, for your security on bogus trips that have nothing to do with your work#
You are simply corrupt. Jail is really where you belong.


#BREAKING: Trump EPA to shut down office handling research on chemicals' effects on children's health http://hill.cm/8Vd58qR  
Robust must mean BULLSHIT.
Let’s have a robust dialogue about the many lawsuits that have been filed against you for misuse of your position.
Shall we?

#PollutingPruitt #BootPruitt #PoisonousPruitt #Trump #EPA
Can we have a robust dialogue about your abuse of office? Traveling on tax payer dollars.
Or just go ahead and resign in shame. Either one works for me!
A better option considering all the deregulation of toxic substances that will soon begin to poison us. Not sure how the proven data can be overlooked. By the way #Flint still dealing with a lead crisis. Heartless greedy, shameful administration.
I'm sitting in a room of five, any one of them would make a better EPA administrator than you, two of them are my dogs.
Great to see plastic water bottles at an EPA round table - shows you really are not EPA material that you didn't notice
How was that family trip to Disney that you charged to taxpayers Scott? How nice to have housing provided by lobbyists and not even caring about obvious corruption.
But did you listen? The @HooverInst acknowledges human activity as a cause of climate change. You are sacrificing our planet & future generations for polluting energy companies. #Traitor #PollutionTzar #Ethics? #climatechange
LIES. FAKE NEWS. You only care about appeasing extraction industries and profiting at the expense of health and a clean environment.

Scott Pruitt IS The Swamp
Oh dear..
Go away, Now. You are terrible

"Their math is, at best, laughably inadequate. At worst, it’s shockingly dishonest."
Hoover Institute unembarassed to call balls n strikes.
Pruitt - return our $40k that you used to go to Morocco to lobby for your landlord

Attention EPA employees: if you are disciplined for using actual facts and science instead of Koch Brothers talking points regurgitated by the Administrator, I want to hear from you. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/03/29/the-energy-202-scott-pruitt-s-climate-message-is-now-official-epa-guidance/5abbfd3630fb042a378a2f23/?utm_term=.007a1e1f66dc …
Do you think that just because you throw the word “environmental” in a tweet that we’ll believe you actually care about the earth?
Nope be honest you were figuring more ways to get money at the expense of the environment.
Get to use your $50K phone booth? 
Why are you so paranoid? What are you hiding?
Something's wrong when a person's so needlessly secretive.

 ABC News: "For much of his first year in Washington,  Trump’s EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt occupied prime real estate in a townhouse near the U.S. Capitol that is co-owned by the wife of a top energy lobbyist, property records from 2017 show." http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/exclusive-cabinet-trouble-trump-epa-chief-lived-condo/story?id=54095310 …
So did you actually pay ANY rent?
How about letting scientists do their job, rather than promoting Trump's horrific agenda.
Who should I believe  on climate change, hhmm, let me think. A politician lawyer or 99% of Scientists? Also, stop lying about past EPA’s travel expenses
Suck it!

Robust can’t really take place if you have ONLY like minded individuals talking .  Robust needs opposing views but you’re napoleon little man syndrome makes that impossible.
You just need to go, we have no faith in you.
Help make it happen by signing this petition!
We demand that Scott Pruitt resign as head of the EPA http://petitions.moveon.org/s/eK81O=  @moveon
Help get @EPAScottPruitt out of office by signing on to this quick & easy petition everyone! 
…
“ clear gaps remain including our understanding of the role of human activity and what we can do about it.”  THERE AREN’T GAPS, YOU JUST WORK FOR COAL AND SOLD YOUR SOUL.
You defame yourself, your political appointment, your family & even, more importantly, your country. Go far, far, far away & hide in shame.
I am GREATLY concerned that you are "dumbfounded" about your casual use of taxpayer dollars that also have NOTHING to do with protecting the environment. STOP misusing taxpayer dollars and reassure people that you will protect the environment while working to do just that.
...and precisely what are your credentials to speak as an authority on environmental topics?
#BootPruitt
#ImpeachPruitt
Whatever Murray tells him.
Boot pruit
Did it include climate change and the highest of priorities for communicating about ALL that, to preserve our world and species?
Oh, that’s right, Pruitt follows his puppet master’s lead &, despite over 2000 studies by credentialed scientists, doesn’t believe in Climate Change!
You need to be FIRED!



This energy lobbyist’s firm reported $16 million in lobbying income last year alone - let that sink in. Obscene amounts of dark money continue to flow into lobbying that turns up in Trump’s pork laden bills like the recent omnibus and tax legislation. https://twitter.com/kfile/status/979380598660837376 …
Go drink some fracking fluid.
Pansy Polluting Pruitt is at it again. Giving away favors to polluters that donate big money, and wasting our tax dollars on luxury travel and tin foil hat security measures. The EPA no longer protects the environment and human health, they only care for corporate interest.
“Robust Dialogue”
wow what a dick! look at all those plastic bottles sitting around! environmental protection my ass
Too bad you won’t actually do your job and protect American health


Pay for your own upgraded travel!
Your tweets are insipid, Scott. And, of course you'd go to a conservative think tank! You're corrupt!
Did you talk about protecting the environment, rather than what you have been doing to it?
Let me guess...you talked about the complete abandonment of environmental leadership, how science is a radical left-wing conspiracy and climate change is a farce?  Stop the lies, Pruitt. You're not fooling anyone. #FirePruitt
You’re a fraud...
@DefendOurFuture The EPA Administrator should protect the environment, not destroy it. Help us #BootPruitt http://bit.ly/2uqFv7Z 
Please resign before you destroy My Land
That's great. When will #Chemtrails be acknowledged and explained to US??? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @EPA @ScottPruittOK #StopSprayingUs #WeKnow
Do you drive a car? It has the same “chemtrail”, it’s called the products of a combustion reaction. A little basic chemistry would be a great subject for you.
