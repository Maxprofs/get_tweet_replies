Excited to meet w/ working families in Atlanta today. The 1st year of the Trump admin has been a year of promises made & promises kept. We’re renewing PROSPERITY & restoring OPPORTUNITY in Georgia & across America. Read my op-ed in @AJC: https://www.myajc.com/news/opinion/opinion-pence-trump-making-america-great-again/cHMzwu1YodpoDx4eOfwW0L/ …
Hey, the ‘POTUS’ could save us even more by just disbanding the EPA altogether! Oh, but then there would be no pretense of environmental protection for you habitual recharacterizers of reality to ballyhoo. So I guess the EPA stays.
Americans are well aware of what youre doing up there Scott Pruitt you will be held legally accountable for attack on the American people, you have put our safety at risk.
You are an evil piece of shit. Really hope those billionaires still have your back when you are out of office. Prick!!

Even as the EPA budget proposes cutting several programs, Scott Pruitt has spent over $150,000 in taxpayer money on premium flights.

There should have been a provision for   an extra $150 million/year to fund YOUR PARANOID LIFESTYLE! Who do you think you are? You are another example of what’s wrong w/Washington. My tax ARE NOT YOUR PERSONAL PIGGY BANK! What you need is a PSYCHIATRIST to address the paranoia!
Scott Pruitt, the moron’s new prima donna, likes his new job. Lots of perks!

The never ending saga of a criminal republican president, his crooked family, his seedy porn stars, his shady friends and his two bit lawyer.

Attention EPA employees: if you are disciplined for using actual facts and science instead of Koch Brothers talking points regurgitated by the Administrator, I want to hear from you. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2018/03/29/the-energy-202-scott-pruitt-s-climate-message-is-now-official-epa-guidance/5abbfd3630fb042a378a2f23/?utm_term=.007a1e1f66dc …
Are you aware that promoting the contamination of our air and water, and destroying the EPA, will also affect you and your family who also live on planet earth? No matter how much money polluters are paying you, destroying our only known home is never a smart idea
You should be focusing on the #GlobalWarming crisis the world faces, and join the #USA in the #ParisClimateAgreement again. I find it quite embarrassing to be a citizen of the US since @potus pulled this reckless stunt. Tragic consequences. @IvankaTrump

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt spent more than $120,000 in public funds last summer for a trip to Italy, with almost $90,000 for food, hotels, commercial airfare and a military jet used by Pruitt and nine EPA staff. http://www.omaha.com/opinion/editorial-too-many-trump-cabinet-member-are-extravagant-in-their/article_7a74b483-1c21-5ce8-8165-e5a99c4f176f.html …
Why are you using our tax dollars to pay for personal trips?? #ethics
Get out!
Keep up the good work Secretary Pruitt! 
History will not look at you kindly.
Isn't an agency that has the word 'Protection' in it about maintaining or producing regulations? It's like a cyber security company rolling back security measures rather than maintaining them or increasing them.
That’s coming too I’m afraid.
Liar
Great the VP who was governor of SUPER POLLUTER Indiana-only a few states get that honor!
Your idea of saving is costing people their lives. Not ver Christian of you you two bit hypocrite
Meanwhile you have caused about $10B in health issues for which some people will literally go bankrupt
Threatening public health by putting the Koch’s and big polluters first, Attacking Science, Attacking and Silencing Climate Scienctist, removing necessary environmental regulations that need to stay in place. THATS NOT PROGRESS
Scott is a toady for corporations who put profit over life.

Alaskans need jobs, Alaska needs revenues. #Pebble Lot
You are a disaster and a hindrance to the health and welfare of Americans. We will remember your actions. Resign before DJT does and it will spare all of us the additional work of fixing your mistakes.
You are freakin' kidding me right?  You call what you jerks are doing to the EPA reform?  Wake up! Our world, as we know it, is being destroyed.  You, sir, are             nothing short of a criminal.
Mourning the once-honorable EPA.
This thing headed by a stooge is hardly environmental protection.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site …
Pruitt has cut money for clean-up at the Hanford site that lines the Columbia River in Washington state.  Currently the most contaminated nuclear (Plutonium) sites in the United States.
EPA now stands for Egregious Pruitt Agenda.
Why r u trying 2 ruin our public land by selling it 2 your oil-company friends? Are u supposed 2 get a cut from their profits? You seem 2 b trying 2 destroy the EPA from within. Why don't American Indians get a voice while u r selling off land they have lived on 4 so many years?

The E.P.A. Says It Wants Research Transparency. Scientists See an Attack on Science.
You are charging tax payers millions of dollars to revamp regulations for your own policies!  It’s outrageous!  Now you want to regulate scientific data???   For who’s benefit?  And how much will it cost to change this?  Scott Pruitt, the EPA ZAR!
Too bad the only thing you’ve ever delivered is greasing
the palms of your poisonous, oily corporate comrades.
#PollutingPruitt #PoisonousPruitt #FirePruitt #EPA #Trump #Environment #TuesdayThoughts #Pruitt
We all pray that you, your family and your descendants die from disease caused by preventable environmental factors you are working to promote. #corruptcriminal

Is this regulatory reform designed to protect the environment? Because if it is cutting it is the exact opposite of what you should be doing.
Are those savings before or after your excessive travel expenses?
What about being called a moron by the smartest person ever?

Piers Morgan: "What message would you like me to relate to him [Trump]?"
Stephen Hawking: "He should replace Scott Pruitt at the EPA"
You’re not an economic regulator. Please go back to Oklahoma
Ironically, Nixon would have rolled over in his grave.
Looks like you have quite a few 'supporters' responding
It is absolutely appalling that you are in an office that has any control over anything at all- quite frankly, your insipidness, your ineptitude, to what this country needs is astounding- make no mistake about it-you're as bad as TRUMP-as FOR PENCE-well there aren't enough words-
@EPAScottPruitt EPA: Poisoning more that Putin ever did!  Bringing on the End of the World though the marvels of wonderful CO2.
Dear leader Pruitt - as you are ok robbing Peter to pay Paul then use some of the ill gotten "savings" to clean up all the Super Fund sites during you term in office :(
I’m calling BS! I have seen & heard enough! Never in the history of protecting our environment have so few impacted so many! Pruitt & Trump do not respect of our mother, Earth. Remove & Replace Trump, fire his minions!
U r killing America- fostering hatred against #immigrants legislating policies tht hurt #students #women #elderly #poor #lgbtqpersons #blackpeople #brownpeople #minorities #environment u foolishly deny #climateChange, add 1.3 tril 2 #debt 2 give #taxbreak 2 #rich #failingAmerica
How am I paying for you to get here? I suppose first class? Also that billion could have prevented the new 90,000 asthma attacks in US kids
Sorry, your many trips back to Oklahoma have exposed your desire to advance your political career there or in DC as AG. You are ruining the environment. Hopefully everything will be over turned in courts.
Pruitt is a schmuck
Horse hockey.
You guys are doing a bangup job, #ScottPruitt and #DonaldTrump. Keep up the good work!!
So what, exactly, are you doing to streamline environmental regulation and make it more effective/efficient for the PEOPLE it's meant to protect?
Nothing. The EPA and Trump are in bed with #BigOil and seemingly care less about our climate and the global threat this poses. #ExxonLied #RexTillerson is complicit. #ClimateChange
#ScrewitPruitt
.@EPAScottPruitt will be held liable for his actions or lack thereof to the environment.
Hey farmer farmer
Put away that D.D.T. now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go

They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
A Joni Mitchell tribute. 
Regulatory reform?  How complying with environmental laws currently on the books?  Excessive ground level smog causes thousands more deaths every year.
This is the wrong message if you are head of the EPA and trying to keep our air and water safe.
Maybe you should focus on more important things like PFOA pollution, dirty air and water and the plastic floating in our ocean.
At what long term cost to the environment and to future generation’s health.   You can’t drink oil, eat coal, or breath money.   Your children and their children will ask what happened to the polar bears, the rhinos, the salmon, and other endangered species, what will you say?
Hypocrite.
Sad that you're proud to poison our air and water to kick $8 billion back to polluters. Human life has no value to you false Christians, Scott.
You're on the right side keep it up.
You , okie, lie!
Ugh how’d you get there? Flew first class? You need to go after wasting $100K on a trip to Italy. You’re a disgrace.
Did you fly 1st Class or charter a private jet this time? @WhiteHouse #EndGeoEngineering #ClimateEngineering #OmnibusBill
Pruitt hadn't taken his security detail on a little vacay in a while, so he thought he'd waste some more of our money. God knows he offers nothing to the conversation about our environment.
I love dirty water and air, thanks
He's honored to join Mike Pence
Claims to have saved dollars and cents
But everyone knows
However the wind blows
Pruitt's an execrable offense.
Hazard to guess the future costs of cancer, oil spill cleanups, toxic waste disposal, water treatment, lung diseases...is that in the budget?
Checking to see if air is still breathable in Atlanta?  If it is you are not doing your job.
You’re fooling no one. You are not protecting our environment. You are hostile to or ignorant of science. And you fly on my dime like it’s your money.
The @EPA administrator is not meant to serve as chief propagandist for a corrupt administration, Scotty. Your job is to protect health and environment, and you aren't even doing that.
#ImpeachPruitt
He doesn't give AF about the environment. #GeoEngineering #ClimateWaterSummit #ClimateEngineering #Chemtrails #Flouride #Depopulation @TrishaDishes @AdolfTwittler8 @realDonaldTrump

Will you guys watch Stormy  on 60 min Together? #porno @potus
Do you ever feel comfortable with that gaslight jammed so far up your a$$? You are one the most hated men in America and that includes Atlanta
How much have you spent on flights?
ew.
