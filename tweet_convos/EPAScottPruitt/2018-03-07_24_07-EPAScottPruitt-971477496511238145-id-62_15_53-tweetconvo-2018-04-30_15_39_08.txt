The last meeting of the trip was a good one! The #PALT2018 group had the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with @EPA. Thank you @EPAScottPruitt! 
You are possibly the worst person on Earth. How does that feel?
I don’t know about Environmentalists, but West Virginians are appalled at how quickly Big Coal took to poisoning and killing all life in this stream, and any freshwater wells for miles around.  Helluva job @EPAScottPruitt!
Trump rolled back regulations that banned coal companies from dumping in rivers/creeks etc. Redditor posted this today from West Virginia coal mining town

In a recent national poll, more than 90% of farmers from 48 states expressed opposition to the pending Bayer-Monsanto merger. I urge you to carefully consider their concerns, and block further consolidation of the already highly consolidated pesticide/seed industry.
Why don't you back out of the driver's seat of the USEPA?  You are leading this country into environmental disaster!!!!  Go!!!!! Get out!!!
So what's the new plan for farmers and ranchers? More pesticides, dump the waste in rivers and streams, more hormones and antibiotics for livestock,...?
(Sorry, I'm usually not so snarky, but I'm a little feed up.)

Why hasn't the EPA Science Advisory Board met in 6 months? #Republican #WarOnScience
The EPA Science Advisory Board hasn’t met in at least 6 months, and some of its members say it's being sidelined to avoid getting in the way of Scott Pruitt's anti-regulatory agenda, Scientific American reports. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epas-science-advisory-board-has-not-met-in-6-months/ …
I don’t see anything of any value that benefits the environment coming out of this meeting.  Especially when you care more about eliminating, necessary regulations that need to stay in place, to appease corporate polluters and dirty fossil fuel and mining companies.
* Snort * like you care about environmentalists.

Your “corporate federalism” and “regulatory certainty” is bullsh!t. Letting corporate America ruin the lands for ALL of us own.  Business do NOT have the right to damage drinking water supplies and clean air that we ALL breathe. Corporate America is encroaching into OUR health.
Take the salamanders off of the endangered list.  Environs are holding farmers hostage.
It's amazing how excellent of a job #ScottPruit is doing. That's not hard to do though considering how destructive the prior administration was. Always vote #Rightwing; it's the right thing to do; and the path to prosperity and moral environmentalism.
You're an idiot. I am deeply embarrassed to even admit I'm a reg rep, the right wing is a sell out, they have sold their morals, ethics, character and values for power and $. There is nothing redeemable about Rep's in this Admin/Congress, what a horrific shame they have become.
You're actually describing the leftwing #Libtards. Draining the swamp means purging the leftwing corruption, lies and deceit, and installing the democratic rightwing freedoms back to the people. We are getting the house in order finally. Have patience and see America Great Again.
Wow. As if Rep's are a bastion of truth and values any longer, smh. There is no defending the indefensible. This administration lies, cheats and is indicated on a daily basis, weekly firings, daily chaos and misdirection. ..you're denial of what is happening is beyond the pale.
You have to stop watching #CNN. LOL
Yeah, I don't watch tv. So, nice try. I get my news from many different sources and vet them, always. One thing I don't do, is listen/watch anyone that is hyper-partisan, you might try to do the same.
Apparently, comprehension isn't one of your strong suits, along with reason, facts and decency - if you agree with this admin. I refuse to engage with a juvenile know-nothing, who parrots Hannity/Jones/Limbaugh/Faux ad nauseam. Good luck with your alternative facts.
You are a piece of **** who claims to follow Christ & screw over the land & people he's to be helping. How much did you get paid in kickbacks to screw America over?
I can believe you actually believe what you’re doing is morally right for the future generations.  Obviously elections have consequences and we’re in opposites but you’re so obtuse it make me ill sometimes because you actually believe the crap your saying.

I didn't realize all the members of the Arkansas Farm Bureau were Native American.  They were the first Environmentalists, after all.
Our nation’s first environmentalists were Native Americans - not ranchers and farmers.






Judge agrees with AG Ferguson that EPA violated the Clean Air Act by delaying air quality standards for ground-level ozone pollution – another successful outcome in a case that has not yet resolved.

Worst EPA EVER
This merger will decrease competition and reduce accountability for these corporations. Monsanto currently faces dozens of lawsuits for the health impacts and financial harms caused by their herbicide products. 

I strongly urge you to block the Bayer-Monsanto merger
How about maintaining clean air & water ya RANCID DOUCHE! 

Stay the fuck away from the West coast; Karma will poison you soon enough
Appreciate you poisoning America!! #DrainTheSwamp
Surely you mean you met with tribal leaders-that’s what “nation’s first environmentalists” has to mean. Right? Right?
And you wonder why 'the marketplace' doesn't like you very much. You tone deaf snake.
Your BS may fool cult45, but in reality, you don’t give a damn about the environment. You’re nothing more than a corporate shill and a fake EPA administrator.
I think the First Nations people were the first environmentalists...
You don't even attempt to hide how misinformed you are. First environmentalists?! Are you kidding?
You are f*ing up our environment. A real environmentalist is @dechristopher
The “nation’s first environmentalists...”? You mean you met with native Americans? No? I didn’t think so.
This man is a scammer, we need a million name to get his out of office Please help us to remove him NOW- HE is not good for our Country send him back to OK
Which tribes were you speaking with today?
Did you meet with the Arkansas Department of Natural Resources?  No, of course not.  The nation's 'first environmentalists' are responsible for the Dust Bowl in the 1930's.  Or was that just 'fake news'? #FirePruitt
On your trip to hell you will experience all the pain you have caused others. Enjoy.
Where does it say in the Bible we are to "exploit" our earth? Having "Dominion" bestows a grave responsibility on us to maintain a sustainable environment.
Yet you have yet to meet with actual environmentalist groups

Scott. What is the difference between a theory and a scientific theory? How old is the earth? Can you drink mercury since it is natural? #science #epa
Native Americans might be offended to hear @EPAScottPruitt call farmers and ranchers "our nation's first environmentalists."

You mean these guys, right?!
Then why are you not supporting research on climate change? Do you still think it is a good thing? What will you do when the GOP administration eliminates the EPA? Our planet is in danger and you continue to take business meetings and slash regulations that protect our planet.
Umm, weren't the Indians the nation’s first environmentalists?
Why are you so confused about your job requirements? You're the most dangerous of Trump's pics. Ignoring environment and protection of public health for the sake of corporate profit. Weak leadership.
You are a danger to the World. May God have mercy on your soul, and may you always travel in coach you lying, oil man.
