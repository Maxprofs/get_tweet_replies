Maybe try to protect those natural resources instead of seeing them as a means to an end?
Furthermore I am sorry that those kids had to be in your presence. I’m sure the smell of brimstone was overwhelming.
They were forced to make a banner for you? I would have called and complained if my kids went to that school.
Did you tell the kids you dont care if they choke on the air they will be breathing in ten years? Or how they will have a fun time with chemo after getting cancer from the chemicals you've applied "regulatory certainty" to?
Hey everybody! Scott Pruit read a children's book aloud and planted one tree. He's thinking, "Am I a good person yet?"
How unfortunate someone gave you cover for your grifting, corruption, destruction of your agency and our country’s natural resources. Your resignation yesterday was already too late.
Hahahahahaha you are such a hypocrite
What a joke... the pro-pollution EPA head has the nerve to address children about being good stewards of our natural resources while he and his buddies rape those same natural resources and the environment. Fuck you Pruitt.
Are you TRYING to be ironic?
Did you tell them you’ve caused 90,000 more asthma attacks in US kids? Or that you caused 3,600 more premature deaths?
Wasted millions?
Scott Pruitt has no idea how to be a good steward of our tax dollars or the environment -hopefully he & his 43K phone booth will soon be gone
Interesting pre resignation activity
Thank you for your service at an agency that has for too long obstructed individual liberties.
What liberties does this organization infringe on? The liberty to pollute your neighbors' air and water?
The liberty to develop my private land as I see fit within the parameters of zoning. Until recently part of my land was deemed "protected wetlands". It was over an acre on a 4,8 acre property. Having the EPA revise policies allowed me to rescind the state classification.
And what are you developing now on your acre of land that you could not previously? A toxic dump? No seriously...what?
Originally a bocce court; however I am afraid that risk a future regulatory opinion telling me it would have to go. My primary concern is now that I can count the land as “usable” I qualify in my state for a larger deduction. No sane person would oppose a cleaner environment.
That sounds like the reasonable response to EPA issues, Dante! Surely there ARE some regulations that need tweaking to make them work better, but the gutting the EPA is one of the dumbest things Americans have ever allowed to be done.
Is it really that bad? The constant attacks on any staff has made me so immune that my knee-jerk reaction is to just assume it is a reaction based on anti @POTUS agenda rather than fact.  @EPA  ensuring clean air land and water is needed. . Regulations need oversight and review.
Looking at your page, #coalash is absolutely the type of issue the @epa should be doing something about.
Fortunately for you, most children don't have the cognitive capacity to understand either your #corruption or the mortal danger your ignorant policies put them in.
#BootPruitt #FirePruitt #PruittMustGo
Mortal danger
Ignorant policies
Necessary points; thank you, Joe!
#BootPruitt
Wow Scott the hypocrisy that is you is shameful and disgusting. It shows how evil you really are.
While you GUT the @EPA and expose all of us taxpaying American voters to toxic hazards - you have the unmitigated GALL to pretend to be a steward of the earth? @POTUS @BootPruitt @ABC
Someone should stick Scott in a hole and bury him, believe me!
You're a liar--AND A CORRUPT LIAR! The EPA Administrator is hired TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE--NOT for fossil fuel companies!
Arrest @EPAScottPruitt, he is fleecing The taxpayers enough is enough please do something @tedlieu @JoyAnnReid @RWPUSA @RepSwalwell @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @politico @CNN
So you lied to school children . and you planted one tree. And you're almost as corrupt at Trump himself.
Wow the only good thing you have done for the environment. Give yourself a cookie for planting a tree.
You are not a steward of anything. Your entire purpose there is to tear down and destroy the agency. You wonder why everyone hates you and yells at you on airplanes. This is part of the reason.
Those are not children’s handprints.
I thought this was The Onion or The Borowitz Report. Have you no shame?
(no, Pruitt has no shame ... and he probably flew a gold-plated jet over to the school)

I can't believe they let you near children! Did you tell them how you are working to destroy their future planet so that you and your oil/coal/chemical/gas executive Friends can buy bigger houses? #BootPruitt
Hypocrisy at its finest - you are an agent of ecological destruction and  care nothing for the environment. Resign, criminal
I’m sure the kids were wondering how long until you’re fired
RESIGN!
Resign,the writing is on the wall!
Your time in government is almost done, you will be fired very soon, you have crapped on Mother Earth, you have lied, you have fleeced American tax payers long enough, and you would not win an election to be dog catcher  bye-bye
Dr. Seuss's The Lorax seems more your style. Poor kids. You can't ignore science/climate change, roll back auto regs/increase air pollution, deny a ban on chlorpyrifos, spend taxpayer$ unethically,...and expect Americans to be okay with it.

Why in the hell would you, @EPAScottPruitt plant a tree, it's  very obvious you and @realDonaldTrump dont give two hoops in holy hell about the atmosphere.
Do you even know what being a good steward means? Why do you still have a job? #Time2Resign
What a #Liar ! Your policies are in direct conflict with anything having to do with Earth Day or  saving natural resources! #Resign
Poor kids had to listen to a POS who doesn’t give a 
flying F about the environment.
You are a corrupt man
What would you know about being a good steward to the environment!!
I wouldn't let your sorry ass anywhere near my children or grandchildren!!! Shame on you @BleckleySchools and those children's parents!!
Palpably disingenuous PR op. Disgusting #FirePruittNow #crook
Your actions don't prove you want to be a good steward of the natural resources God entrusted us with.  #FirePruittNow
What marketing firm are you using?
#FirePruitt for being a corrupt, unfit for office, self serving, “person”.
Resign
Thanks, that's global warming solved then.
Oops sorry kids.
Tear down that tree, Scotty! There might be some oil underneath for your buddies!
Pruitt, you're a horrible steward of our natural resources. & the criminal reasons should have landed you in prison a long time ago. For a small bribe, you'll let polluters continue to spew & ignore the health declines & premature deaths of thousands. We all know how you operate.

There are no fewer than 10 federal investigations into Scott Pruitt. Pruitt remains EPA administrator.

RT if agree that he should be FIRED immediately.

…
We don't want you here. -America #RESIGN


POST EDITORIAL: The more we learn about Pruitt, the clearer it is he needs to go https://wapo.st/2HpLPTi?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.c920dd5558b3 …
Is that a gold shovel? Did you fly there first class?
Really? 

A school allowed you to interact with students?

That is terrifying.

You should have read “Silent Spring”.

Because a dead earth will be your legacy.

Kind of like having a crisp C-note burning a hole in your wallet, isn't it, #Pruitt ? You just can't control the desire to exploit natural resources in your midst...they're so tempting, all those trees & natural gas & coal! Gotta use 'em before they spoil or something, right?!
I would have kept my kid home the day you showed up to school. Wouldn’t want to expose them to your corrupt, immoral, unethical standards.
I can’t believe they allowed a corrupt pos like you into their school. Shame to all.
Did you tell them you have rolled back protections and they are going to inherit a huuuuge ecological disaster?
Hey, I have the same tree planting shoes.  Ugh
How many millions have you wasted???
How can you stand next to those kids when you are taking active measures to pollute their world and endanger their health?
Resources - and their extraction, exploitation - are very different things. #BootPruitt #TrumpCrimeCabinet
Grifters are doing it for themselves.
You are corrupt and have repeatedly abused your power. Resign!
How many trees will you cut down to enhance the fossil fuel industry?
You are the most corrupt cabinet member in the history of the U.S.  There is little doubt that your career will end with your firing and criminal charges.  I truly hope you use your time in prison to change your life.
why don't you read "the Polar Bears who starved to death because of global warming"? It's not about dirt and minerals. It's about life.
A good day for @EPAScottPruitt
Administrator Pruitt, the gentleman from Oklahoma who believes irony is the polar opposite of wrinkly.
How many bodyguards were needed for this event?
Good Stewards of the natural resources. OK YOU HYPOCRITE!!!
Did you tell them the story on how you poisoned their fruit to put money in your pocket?
You are a lying, corrupt hypocrite.  You deserve to spend the rest of your life in jail and then eternity in hell.
You are anything but a good steward of natural resources and the rest of the earth which you seem hell bent on destroying all while wildly spending my tax dollars. You are not anywhere near a good ROI. #ScottPruittMustGo
Criminal resign
*in whispers* “Everyone is looking at you and talking about you and spying on you”. #MAGA #SoundProofBooth #SoMuchWinning
And that's the most technically rigorous Earth Science book @EPAScottPruitt has ever read.
@EPAScottPruitt what’s it like being one of the most hated men in America, traitor?!
Hope the kiddos got to tour the private jet you flew in on!
sorry about the asthma kids! but how about this book? quick Jimmy take a pic. ok cya!
Do you honestly live in your soundproof phone booth? I am stunned that you continue to post tweets as if the entire world doesn't hate your guts. You are the only cabinet member who unites Dems and Repubs. Please God resign or toss yourself in a superfund site. #firepruitt
You're a crook.
Theocratic fascism -

Assert dominion
over the fish of the sea
and over the birds of the heavens
and over every living thing that moves on the earth

Everything was placed on this earth specially for us blessed humans and our blessed corporations to subdue and use
Hey @EPAScottPruitt Did you also advise the kids you'd let any one who gave you a nickel, that you'd sell out their land and destroy their property?
Good steward, my ass.  Poor brainwashed kids. They don’t know that you’ve already sold them out on climate change. Temperature rise, sea level rise, violent weather - it’s all coming their way, thanks to you and your industry bosses.

What a waft of bullshit @EPAScottPruitt
You're corrupt as F @EPAScottPruitt.
#TrumpCrimeSyndicate
Too bad you aren’t doing anything to protect the health of these kids

#ResignNow
You're a leech on society Scott.  Resign.

Mr Pruitt has committed himself to undoing as many Obama-era environmental regulations as he can https://econ.st/2r6DjxP 
I would have loved to hear more about your day at school but I couldn't hear you well from back here in coach. Next time you take a trip to gladhand and kiss babies try commuiting there like a regular guy too. It will help with concealing your greed sneer, I swear
Scott Pruitt Is Either A Liar Or Grossly Incompetenthttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-bardella-scott-pruitt_us_5ae083d4e4b061c0bfa3fc84
“Steward”? You have the temerity to use that term? The paradigm is shifting away from the fossil fuels, but the money you take makes you willfully blind to that. Your grandkids will have to live with your actions. Hope they don’t get asthma from smog.

Your not a goid steward your a corporate white and criminal.
That's sick that you show up and make those poor kids make a "welcome Pruitt" sign.
You are nothing but a planet killing POS! What type of school invites you to talk about being a steward to the environment you've done every thing you can to remove regulations! You've sued the EPA prior to appoint to do just that - You are a planet killer bought and paid for!
I would have pulled my kids from school rather than listen to a liar.
you lie like a rug #EPA #Trump
#Trump #Russia #Mueller #USA #fakenews #Politics #TuesdayThoughts #MAGA?
Keep repealing regulations you POS
I, Dirty Hannity, maintain a lusty boner for Scott Pruitt.  Mr. Scott Pruitt is a perfect melding of corruption, paranoia, hypocrisy, and chickenshit Okieness.
Thank you for making it easier for huge corporations to pollute our clean air, land and water Mr Pruitt!!!! 
Literally no one believes this.
"good stewards of the natural resources"?... You hypocritical SOB. Update the resume, you're outta there!
Jesus abhors swamp critters, swamp critter.
What have you stolen from taxpayers today Scott and how will you poison the planet next?
RESIGN
Why are you raping the environment and ripping off the taxpayers?

Did you talk about the importance of honesty, ethics and being good stewards of the U.S, Treasury? Perhaps you gave a mini course on graft.
Are you serious? This is like you complaining about your rent.
How wilted!
Another corrupt official. Keep on spending our money like there is no tomorrow.
Equating environment with harvestable resources is antithetical to the intention that started the EPA.



Hold on to that feeling of 'doing Right' .. extend it out to exercise it regularly.  You just may enjoy the feeling!
Selfie tour resumes.
Hahaha. You are the Trump mascot. Constant illumination of lies and corruption. The Talk ofcthe town the cartoon character.   Keep up the volume. Hilarious 
He read a book and planted a tree. All is balanced now.
get the fuck out of here with this #Pruitt who you think u fooling.....? nobody but the crazies who allowed you to be in that classroom surrounded by our future generation....
Why don’t you resign you crooked POS
You know anyone renting out a cheap apartment in DC? Asking for a friend.......

You don't have to be an idiot to think that burning wood is carbon neutral, but it sure helps.
The last time I spent $50 a night was in the 70's and that was a flea bag. How do you find those kind of digs in DC? You're a fucking crook.
While you're at it, keep digging and maybe you'll end up in another universe where you will be the only living being and you can spend the rest of your life ripping yourself off, you unethical little man.  Phew, that was cathartic.

You need to plant more than one tree to make up for all your misdeeds to the environment you crook
You can read? Amazing.
Ohhhh so cute, Scotty. You are trying to play nice to cover up all the truly horrible things you have done to negatively impact Mother Earth !  Guess what? It won’t work...you are a sleazy, corrupt, self-centered man who deserves to be remove from the EPA. #FirePruitt
.@realDonaldTrump , don't fire this A$$, he's good for the dems. NOV2018 
Sycophant sellout.
#God says !!!
Step down @EPAScottPruitt. Your continued presence representing @EPA and American citizens is a black mark on History.
You disgust me
You think a tree makes up for the damage you've done? All in the name of greed and big business interest? When will you and other immoral Trumpers think beyond yourselves to long-term consequences??

You better cough up some dough for your private security when you're fired. You may need it as you've pissed of a lot of people, you criminal.
Can you teach those youngsters to #getoutandrockhound when they plant those trees! #PruittEra #ScottPruitt #foxnews #cnn #PruittMustGo #PruittMustResign #EPA
Resign you crook!
wow the tree man got shot, with 600 students he could have planted 600 trees.
Great post, I encourage EPA to grant more Technical Impracticability Waivers under CERCLA 
Stay strong and carry on @EPAScottPruitt! #MAGAUr dong a great job! 
I do believe we should plant more trees and stop cutting them all down.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You should not be allowed near children.
The biggest F'ing joke of the day, coming from #PruittPlanetKiller
Resign grifter! @POTUS 
#PruittMustResign
Don't any of you hater have jobs?

Awesome job Mr Pruitt 
Any chance of dropping the Montreal Protocol?  All these refrigerants were based off of false and debunked global warming liberal agenda. Can you help the small guy?  Can you get rid of the efficiency BS on air conditioners?
You've gone quite mad. How dare you talk to anyone but your priest about the importance of being good stewards of America's natural resources! In case you don't remember, or more likely, never learned, it begins with "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned." #FirePruitt #BootPruitt
