we should coordinate / align with WBEs and insurance agents who want to be more impactful via state collaboration
Yes. Willing to help? Sadly, it's the hard to reach, immigrant, rural and vulnerable communities that will suffer most.
Sample of what we're up to already - please share:
You beat me!
This slide w'd make good bumper sticker. I just don't think Twitter is enough. Folks needing ACA don't spend time on Twitter as much as I do
We're reaching more than 1/2 million on three social media platforms. We're going to keep at it.
That's gr8. Sorry for my ignorance, who is "we"? And do u have ready-to -use info that could be shared/distributed via various channels? Tx
Click the link. Ask to join. We prepare messages and use Thunderclap to amplify message.
Ah, it's Thunderclap. Thanks for clarifying. Will do all I can.
It is NOT his place to notify you. Ion sure you were notified by the insurance company. Read your mail better.
Why am I being mentioned here?!?
I don't know, my response was to Andy...
Why would he its failing thanks to obama. Sign up for bullshit healthcare!
Then the press is partly to blame if  they haven’t asked the Press Secretary to address it.
I changed my header to show 2018 #ACA #Obamacare open enrollment dates. I hope others will do the same & share. h/t @choo_ek @TopherSpiro
I just did the same, thanks for the idea!
@choo_ek came up with the idea! Love it! Love it! Love it! 
Love this but everyone needs to add HOW to sign up. I'm in marketing: Ads need explicit directions, on the header it blocks the website. :(
Okay, give us a better one and we'll use it.
Working on it! Double checking Facebook dimensions. Twitter would be different. They make it complicated!
I updated the original graphic, so please contact Indivisible for the Signup Project or go to the Thunderclap, but here is a Twitter Header
Ok, Here is a Facebook Header- NOTE: desktop shows the center portion only, mobile shows tall version, so that is why it's two layers #ACA

...forwarding
Share! Retweet! Tell family & Friends #SundayMorning #AMJoy Enroll #ACA
It's a disaster. The real harse fines were coming out next year. This was a law that 70% of America did not want, but was forced on us away!
It already SANK, you fools. Based LIES and misrepresented. NO more money promoting a failed system. Dems don't get it. SO much $$$ spent!

Has anyone heard of a grassroots campaign to help get the word out? If not, how do we even do that???
There are grassroots enrollment coalitions across the country! In Southern CA, CCHI is a good place to start
Could flyers be made? Everyone can put them up everywhere especially low income and senior areas where they might not be on social media.

I'll be distributing this flyer in the Mid-Missouri area. 
are there fliers for other states somewhere?

circumvent Trump. We can use @IndivisibleTeam network n call newspapers Tv radio n get the word out. We need to organize now implement in
Where was initiative from citizens in 2009 when enrollment and premiums were low? We could have had robust market w this level of concern.
I don't think people understood Obamacare n how it worked until it was going to be taken away. We need to concentrate on now then go back.
Indiana peeps
It starts November 1, right?
It's not his job it's the dept of health & human services or the head of the ACA or maybe your God Obama
Post to Profile and Share Widely
We're doing some cool stuff with the private sector in Chicago. Would love to fill you in.
Of course a problem "but" current enrollees should be reasonably informed, insurers have incentive to step up, etc may not be disaster
can you make something we can share on FB with pertinent info? We can make it spread far and wide!
We at One Thing You Can Do already have an ACA Open Enrollment post ready to go on Nov 1, and we'll keep reposting it till enrollment ends.

Why arent you talking about CHIP and CHC funding expiring? Who is talking about? I need information.

Hey Andy, the ACA died on it's own!  The whole thing was a big damn lie, propagated by pin heads like you on behalf of Barry!
Please re-post!
ACA was meant to fail and has well before Trump.
Doesn't matter for us because we have ZERO 2018 #ACA plans to choose from. Meanwhile, media & advocacy groups - crickets.
Looks like the counties who voted for trump.
And this is how he thanks them. 
Every @IndivisibleTeam, in every community, should form a street team to get the word out.
Lie
#ComeAndGetYourHealthcare!
Since when does the president have to inform you to renew your license, pay your bills, apply for Medicaid or medicare?
You think the public doesn't know by now that the ACA is out there. Open enrollment same time every time.
SHARE this terrific #ACA meme via your social media networks. I will continue to do so thru the enrollment period. #NoACASabotageOnOurWatch

Evil SOB Trump ! His supporters should be sent to Fl and the hurricane
You would think he'd be more concerned about the tens of thousands that lost their home ..and the tens of thousands that could lose home?
Lol. ACA is doomed and there is literally nothing you can do about it.

Another false tale
If ACA is so great, why would ppl need reminding to enroll? Could it be they can't get far away from it enough?
Obamacare is a joke. My sister is going through hell with it. It needs to go back to private with some tweaks. Don't lie Andy.
Can someone please make some vinyl car magnet signs that we can purchase to highlight this info on outside of our cars?
Musician communities are hard to reach for a variety of reasons.  Investment in outreach still very much needed.

 why ok hill/obama take millions from soros who admits he wants to collapse the dollar He funds antifa/blm 50+groups

We are here to help!!!
Far worse - Obama paying J. Gruber $400k to (admittedly) dupe Americans into thinking they wouldn't pay more.
Repulsive childish behavior, lashing out at others because he was "hurt". What a disgraceful excuse for a human being.
No one who had Obamacare will defend that scam! You're rich liberals that didn't have to use it. Do you have Obamacare? No. Cause it sucks
Something to add?
None of our doctors will take our policy... and its costing us 1600 a month. So its useless anyway.
Millions of people need ACA
Open Enrollment was still 3 months away. Why make up stuff and tweet them? #journalismisdead #libfails
You really need to be told? Is your memory that bad? It's mandatory; there should be be no need for ads.
Anyone who doesn't know about open enrollment is living under a rock.

HE decided that? Or his admin with his blessing on a whole bunch of changes? Not worth distinguishing? Who believes it's "only option"?
Made six ads for the ACA here: https://twitter.com/nastiestwoman/status/904099426913935364 …
 sharing!
ACA is a joke. It's NOT affordable. Stop wasting tax money on this pit
Ha ha. Aca was sinking the moment it was passed into law without the idiots that voted it in clearly didn't read the whole bill. Shame
@TheDemCoalition pisses me off to no end. People will suffer and die because of him and his Republican party
Except the more people that are in it, the more the program will cost the people who pay taxes... meaning it would become a bigger target...
can private citizens buy billboards & ads to promote #ACA details? Are there marketing materials other than social media avail?
It will never cease to amaze me how the left can spread shit on its toast like butter how does that shit taste I'm curious
he should just tell them that it will save them 2500 bucks a family and they can keep their doctor/plan.
It is the same enrollment as it is every year. What moron does not know this? why would we spend 10 million to advertise it
You need to provide the information in order to RT it. So where is it?
Just this. Save and RT this image!
Billboards; big, clearly readable signs from 50 yards at every T rally, appearance; contact local news & have your own rally; 1/3
neighborhood signs (like garage sales signs); pin up 8x11 posters on laundromat & grocery store boards; start email forwards; 2/3
FB viral campaigns; church bulletins, healthcare workshop activities; & wouldn't it be cool if this had ACA dates?  3/3
4/4
One of the most utterly, ridiculous humans on this planet.
No argument there, re Jeffrey; really like the #Resistance PR tactic, tho!
Yeah, THAT's what's going to sink ACA; not the fact that it's a stupid, socialistic idea in what is supposed to be a free country.
I plan to re-tweet this often. Feel free to do the same. #WeThePeople must do what we can to thwart this incompetent/evil administration.
Get everyone on Facebookand twitter to put a sign up meme as their cover picture. (The large one at the top of your page)
@SenBookerOffice the sad reality of your open enrollment
Someone really needs 2explain how Obamacare is supposed 2B affordable for the working class. This is absolutely ridiculous! Needs repealed! 
Already telling people on and offline.

President Trump is not to blame for individual ignorance. Also, I don't care. Illegal is illegal.  #AmericaFirst
That's the idea. Repeal. Then replace.
Lies.
It's been this way for several years....just like the tax filing deadline.  People need to take responsibility for their lives

Trump wants to end advertising so #TheResistance will take over as usual. Resources thread

Did Obama ever remind people? No. It's the health insurance companies that remind people
Dude, that ship sank before it started. Only 1 carrier in NC and there's nothing affordable about it. It was a bad deal from the start.
Everyone should know by now if they read it...oh wait read it my bad.
Many people only have one insurer to buy from... it is sinking itself
Good!!!!
The majority of us Americans never asked for ACA in the first place. Government shouldn't even be in the health insurance biz.
Tell me how to spread the word
Yeahhh, that's it. #MAGA
We have known about the ACA gor 9 years now. No need to mention something most os js don't want.

On my page already - scroll for a little bit and you'll see it
When we did know about open enrollment we couldn't afford it, so who cares!
Delusional!
Hi! Thanks for following me! 
please to meet you
Pleased to meet you too! Formerly triciaonnor8 now using my spiritual name Gemma Raintree Storm. 
Trump doesn't sell insurance for a living.  If you want to partake in govt handouts, learn about them and reach out. Take some self control.
Good, if they're to stupid to get free stuff from others.
The ACA IS A FUGGIN JOKE! 
FIRST YEAR 59. $
SECOND YEAR 670 $
How is it up to Trump to inform people when THEY need to sign up for THEIR insurance,  makes ZERO SENSE
it has already sunk. no one wants to board a submarine on the bottom of the ocean
Is that really his job?
#ACA Ads are not affordable.
Trump is saving Taxpayers over $5 million worth of Obamacare advertising.
Bye bye Obama Legacy.
HELLO #MAGA
It's not the president job to tell people to buy over priced insurance. Believe it or not people can be responsible for themselves
Democrats do not condemn hatred and violence of Anifa in order to support it. Anifa is not your only option to free and protected speech
I think that he's kinda busy right now and that isn't exactly his job. That is your responsibility to find out. Nice spin tho to blame him
You assume we the people are stupid and can't think and act on our own. We know when and how to sign up.
That is hardly what would or wouldn't sink it. 
Wrong, sir. That is not the President's job. Our last president chose that role because he was trying to secure his legacy, which is fine.
Are people that stupid that they didn't know about open enrollment?
He's sic. No I mean that!

Check out http://www.acasignups.net  for lots of info, printable fliers, enrollment graphics too. Wonderful resource. follow @ACAConsumer
Is there a link to post on the various social media platforms we all use?
Why can't media do public service ads if so important? Why does govt. have to pay for everything.
Or... Obama spent way more money than he disclosed & from unapproved sources to support it
Damn your a troll, how many times you going to say it
Better tag some famous friends!  @PodSaveAmerica @PodSaveThePpl @crookedmedia @johnlegend
He is required by the Constitution to see that all laws are faithfully executed. (The "Take Care Clause," Art. II, Sec. 3)
To hell with the ACA. Legislation that sucks!
Thank you my kids need their ACA

Please post to FB and Twitter and myself, and I'm sure other people & organizations, will take the wheel.

..so if #POTUS doesnt tell you wipe your ass after the shitter & you get skid marks on your drawers, its his fault? Personal Responsibility!
It would have been flawless, had Trump only told everyone! 
Unrelated, Trump never told me to get a driver's license so I am immobile.
Yep Trumpian move but the Democrats should!
Thank goodness why promote a trainwreck
Open enrollment for ObamaCare  starting November 1 to December  15 for 2018.
ACA sucks!
Because he, and a good portion of the @GOP, don't believe it's a basic right.  Too chickenshit to say it knowing they'd be voted out.
Each state needs to get the info out!!
Open Enrollment November 1 to December 15th

LMAO! You’ve obviously been in a time capsule or are in denial. The Very #UnAffordableCareAct is imploding. #RepealReplaceACA @seanhannity
He also defunded $ for advertising open season 4 ACA, spiteful devious evil corrupt jealous of President OBAMA, inhuman from outer space 666
Your conspiracy theories are tiring.  Come up with a different way to oppose him. O'care has been dead for 2 yrs. My premiums inc 100% in CA
Let your elite bosses pay for socialized medicine. Tax the elite, not the backbone laborers paying for their free ride and luxury.
So what do you think we should spend to remind people to pay taxes or buy car insurance?
