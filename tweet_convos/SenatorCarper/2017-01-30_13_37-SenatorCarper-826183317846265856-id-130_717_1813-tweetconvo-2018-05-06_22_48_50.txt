Does he know that you voted for him? I would think that counts for something.
Did you listen??
Thank you!
-Remember you were elected to represent the interests of Missourians correct? Just a reminder you are up for re-election in 2 yrs
Thank you. Do not let up on this.  Demand answers.
Thank you. What is your next step on Tuesday?  Act fast to remove Trump and Bannon. They must not persevere. @SenateMajLdr @GOP
I watched Kelly and crew news conf. I felt like Kelly was not telling the truth. There have been so many lies. Zero credibly.
Good job.  Thanks
Gen Kelly said that he knew 2 years ago that we would go Democratic Republic to Banana Republic were @realDonaldTrump 2B elected.
Thank you for taking action against this unconstitutional and despicable act.
Start acting like you're pro USA instead of some political hack. Trump did nothing that BHO hasn't done!
TAKE ACTION: 

1. #withholdconsent no unanimous consent

2. #nojusticenobills filibuster all bills

3. Oppose all appointments
THANK YOU
please also STOP the appt of Bannon to the National Security Council!!! #StopPresidentBannon
Thank you! Don't let up! I'm with you!
Who is going to stop Trump?
-Withhold consent on senate activity until ban is lifted. Stop Bannon & save our democracy
Also I am newly active(Womens March)-I dont get how Spicer come out and lies everyday. &  3million illegal voters. What?
So proud to see you #standup.
Thank you for your leadership on this. Please continue to hold @POTUS accountable for his reckless, dangerous policies.
it is time to rally the party and get them moving. Silence=acceptance
stop the madness. Horrified by immigration order
Senator McCaskill- PLEASE VOTE NO TO JEFF SESSIONS AND BETSY DEVOS! Thank you~!
Lots of good data in this article https://www.wsj.com/articles/countries-under-u-s-entry-ban-arent-main-sources-of-terror-attacks-1485708300 …


thank you!!! Keep up the good work! Missouri is lucky to have you!
You Go Claire!!! I'm so proud of you!
answers to what??
Your letter definitely DOES NOT reflect the position of most Missourians!  President Trump is right on!
thank you Senator! Don't listen to the eggs, your constituents support you! Please call for a hearing to remove Bannon from NSC!
so glad to see this kind of leadership.Appreciate your efforts to question and push back. Thank you
Hope he tells you to shove it!
I don't care what else you do in this session besides legalizing marijuana nationally is to block all scotus picks 4 next 4 years
please post this to Facebook
Thanks, Senator!
@Jesspiper7 Maybe you should approve Trumps cabinet picks.
Thank you, Senator. I'm a constituent who plans to support you in 2018. Continue the courage! Be visible! #resist
Thank you for taking action!!
Are you unfamiliar with EO? You and Congress voted these country trained terrorist to send here in 2011. Convenient memory loss
Thank you!  You rock!
Thank you for having Americans back.  Honor you
thank you @clairecmc
@chrislhayes Bannon and Miller overstepped their position,  perhaps illegally.  There could be serious repercussions.

Fight the good fight. #NoBan
Thank you!  We can't let this behavior stand #NoBanNoWall
trump slides things in quietly and quickly hope someone ans you before something else hits the fan!
please scream from the treetops so "our" voices will be heard!
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenWarren @repjohnlewis @SenSanders @RonWyden @SenFeinstein @alfranken THANK YOU!for leadership we need
@chrislhayes worth noting 4 of these senators come from states Trump won. And NH might be purplest state in the union.
@KatCapps 
The most dangerous thing is #DHS refusal to obey civilian judges. Lawless. Then they order others not to comply. (CBP)
Go get 'em, Claire!
Thank you, Senator McCaskill!
Thank you! @LindaLawrey
@chrislhayes The first Senate Committee hearing with Kelly and Mattis should be awesome. "Sir, do. you agree with Trump on EO"?
thank you Senator. Thank you.
Please ask him about adherence to the court orders as well
Waaahhh... look at me. No one is fooled, Claire.
plz bring wisdom & balance into these unvetted & disastrous actions coming out like this, esp any that harm children / families
Thank you!!!
@RoyBlunt When we have children worried about their future, that should be a red flag.

Poor Amanda and Julie-will get a barrage of harassing emails. Should have blocked out the staff names and contact.
So happy to see this. Our leaders are working double time on our behalf these days. We're all behind your efforts! Thank you!
Pull @SenateGOP on the letter too. Cross the aisle. The more against them the better.
Bannon is a danger to our democracy and our nations security. He has no business being on the NSC
Give me a break! Nothing but more partisan liberal tomfoolery
thank you senator!
@Kelseey123456 why did you vote to confirm General Kelly?
@chrislhayes thank heavens!
Thanks you @clairecmc @KamalaHarris and other @SenateDems on committee. Don't let DHS off the hook for these answers
Are you going to be asking Gen Kelly about reports of some @DHSgov agents defying the court orders issued Saturday night?
@chrislhayes 
Thanks
Thank-you and good luck!
did you not know religion is central to refugee status?
. They have Christians there also. Not sure what your trying to implicate.
After most of you voted to confirm him, losing all leverage on something like this. Good work!
@chrislhayes When are the Dems escalate all this #DisTrumpia to the level it requires? Forgo useless minority bills. #Resist.
I'm sorry but a letter isn't enough.
Fight for us--get the Democratic Party up and running. We need a strategy to save our country.
@chrislhayes stop pussy footing around like old days (last week)! Force your hand! Every mean hand you have! #impeachtrump
While you are waiting- OBSTRUCT!
how is Trump unsecured phone any different than Clinton's unsecured email?  Please ask dhs this too!!
@chrislhayes Sue for contempt by Sec if CBP continues to defy orders. Need to chooae between demo/ rule of law and unlawful DJT.
Thank you for being strong on this! Vote no on all remaining cabinet appointments! Do not bend! Do not give in!!
.@clairecmc @washingtonpost @NYtimes @MSNBC @maddow @Lawrence
Thank you for fighting for our country.
Good, Bannon and Miller need to be removed and or arrested now.
THANK YOU!!
Where is the GOP? They should be concerned too.
Ask him is this the beginning of a Police State, example of Police State? If not then what is it? #MuslimBan
@chrislhayes not enough, do more and please don't vote for any more cabinet nominees, the 4 you voted for was more than enough
Why are you sooo Damn worried about refugees? Where is this concern for our veterns & homeless? What about our seniors& Medicare& insurance?
@chrislhayes thank you senator!
Claire we are so scared out here. Don't let them take judicial powers away from govt. tht's what they're trying 2 do HelpUsFight!
great!! Now please uncover Team Trump's Russia connections. ASAP!!
follow @Khanoisseur. He's put many of the pieces together.
@chrislhayes No crying allowed
@chrislhayes YES! Keep fighting! Thank you!
if you expect that to work, I have a bridge I’d like to sell you.
