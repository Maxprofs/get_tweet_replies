@BarackObama would be an achievement if you'd got them to pledge to reverse climate change,  not a target of 2 degrees
@seanieb1983 @BarackObama he nor anyone can reverse it unfortunately. We are on a nat uptrend that would exist with or w/o human involvement
@Robbiedee88 @BarackObama hardly natural when we've spent 100+ years dumping Co2 into the atmosphere....
@seanieb1983 @BarackObama global warming, global cooling, CO2, methane, et al., have fluctuated naturally for millions of years.
@Robbiedee88 @seanieb1983  but I don't know why I argue, you wouldn't believe you have a nose on your face if @BarackObama said you did
@joshareed no, I believe in keeping the earth preserved as much as anyone, but the unbiased data contradicts the whole movement.
@Robbiedee88 let's apply to real problems like accountability on all those awful politicians.
@joshareed those politicians that claim this crap is real, you believe they will tone down their lifestyle for this shit, no way
@BarackObama it's all a big hoax to control you
@Roope00 @BarackObama thanks Obama
@Roope00 @BarackObama without joking, it's great all the countries signed!
@BarackObama almost every country bowed down to China thanks to you "agreements".
@BarackObama thank you
@BarackObama Thanks for all that you do. Have a blessed holiday season and a health and successful New Year
@BarackObama love you so much President Obama, keep up the good work
@BarackObama @treyptrsn too bad its unconstitutional and a total fraud

@BarackObama Thanks a lot!
@BarackObama America is the BIGGEST source of pollution. @treyptrsn
@BarackObama @treyptrsn it's a lie, it's more of China leadership than America's
@BarackObama @luce_pyre Well done mate although I do think the early work of @MrKRudd laid foundations.

@BarackObama You guys had a chance to protect the land, people's rights & sovereignty, establish a true market & you didn't do it!

@BarackObama just resign already? I am a disabled veteran and besides all your other failures the way you have allowed the VA to pretend to
@BarackObama Leadership?  Really?
Hey @Communism_Kills ! There he goes being Communist again!

@BarackObama
.@BarackObama Thank goodness this will help solve....no..wait..it wont do jack. More money down the drain. Thankfully u can just print more
@BarackObama True leadership speaks for itself. No narcissistic, self-congratulatory pat on the back required.
@BarackObama most worthless president ever
@BarackObama Thanks Obama!
@BarackObama Thank you, dear leader. This should solve the Radical Islamic Terrorism, right?

@BarackObama You haven't completed the greatest corrupt Socialist heist in history yet, Marx Jr.
@BarackObama 5 things is all you need to know of Paris Climate deal.
@BarackObama yes but that has nothing to do with our worlds current situation. You're just diverting attention away from the real problem
@BarackObama American leadership,looks very funny
@BarackObama strange how the USA cares so much about climate and the planet & environment yet is still testing nuclear weapons this year
@BarackObama also China and many other countries-but yeah we care about climate change bs
@BarackObama Sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of terrorists infiltrating America.
@BarackObama @VulcanInc let's stop using those fossil fuels then, eh?
@BarackObama Obama doesn't even know for sure if the planet is heating up but he knows he can initiate socialist policies with this policy.
