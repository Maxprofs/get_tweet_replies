 #RussiaGate + "#VoterFraud= bipartisan call 4 immediate #NewElection & #50StateVoteAudit.
GOP is complicit w TREASON & will never investigate. #NewElection only way to stop this.
Both sides claim tampering w election = #NullifyElection #50StateVoteAudit.
@POTUS 
See Immigration Act of 1965
US Code Title 8 Chapter 12 Sub II Part 1 S 1152
@POTUS its not reckless it helps keep Americans safe jackass
Trump must be inpeached before he finds a reason to declare martial law.
@POTUS Bravo Senators, you are on the right side of history.
but will you withhold consent requiring cloture, tie Senate in knots, resist until removal of Trump?
- That's no solution. The solution is to get rid of him and you know that.
McCain supporyedtried Milkin from jail after he bilked many people out of
@POTUS your working on legislation together is so sad. #America #POTUS
There's no denying we've got a tyrannical, egomaniacal madman occupying the Oval Office!
We LOVE the thought of you working together to shut down this un-American EO.
#stopdapl #stopkeystonepipeline #wesignedtreatysdontyouthinkweshouldupholdthem
If all of you really want to help then #ImpeachTrump before he destroys the U.S.
@jlwalker97 @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS IMPEACH Donald!
@POTUS I never thought in my wildest dreams thought I would agree with LGraham and JMcCain
Thank you for tweeting this.
.@ChrisMurphyCT @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC let's not forget that our standing in the world is shrinking quickly.
no its not
@POTUS  Hum, didn't they vote for this under Obama?!?
@POTUS Trump & Team tells falsehoods over and over till they we believe. Sound familiar  ACT
fight back for us! Fight back with us!
let us work to vote you out of office
this is bigger than party politics. Follow the money, stand up 4 us, shut DT/Bannon down
Do you represent America? Or you favor other countries? Where were u when Obama banned Iraq?
Please help STOP Trump/Bannon madness! What is being done toward impeachment?
Your  grandstanding is jepordizing the safety/security of US citizens! Doesn't that matter?
frankly, I welcome aomeone who actually does what he said. Enough of parasite politicians
Please impeach before he kills us all.
thank you all for your bipartisan #leadership
@POTUS this is no longer about party.  It's about our country & who we are as a nation.
up is down and black is white. Now I'm agreeing with McCain and Graham.
So many Americans would be into this Super Group. Please coordinate action!
Thank you for being decent men who think for the people. U dont blindly follow Trump.
- please stop his madness.  No Sessions. No DeVos. No Wall.
all three are definitely happening. Deal with it.
With the power of the resurrection, prayer and fasting we have already defeated your agenda!
This is why Americans hate you!  Babies slaughtered in the womb, body parts sold. Hypocrits!
Over 2 million Christians butchered/burned/tortured/rape while you stood by!  Evil creeps!
You all are fake news.  This was done by Barry (Obama). And most of the world applauds Trump!
We The Ppl of this country aren't buying the B.S. http://that.you  three are selling. It's over!
@POTUS McCain and Graham backed up by a Democrat how interesting...lol
let's hope @SenJohnMcCain & @LindseyGrahamSC keep word. So far, have defaulted & fell in line w GOP & @POTUS #NoWallNoBan
pleasee run for president in 2020!
What are your thoughts Chris about when Obama did this in 2011?
RINO'S and #losers join forces to accomplish nothing.  Just like they have done for decades.
you are my senator! Please get the other members to see that none of this is reasonable
are you supporting Feinstein's bill? Curious if it will have enough support.
yes gentlemen.   Get on the same page for all of us.
@POTUS nice to see republicans who are citizens first. Thx 4 your integrity Senators.
@POTUS where were u all at in 2011? http://thefederalist.com/2015/11/18/the-obama-administration-stopped-processing-iraq-refugee-requests-for-6-months-in-2011/ …
ask them to join you a Supreme Court tomorrow. Bipartisanship is necessary.
this is what we need. Doing what's right despite party differences.
@SenFeinstein is also drafting legislation. Swift action is needed.
@POTUS The misinformed, misguided hysterics R deafening. Where was outrage when BHO did same?
I want the Common sense vetting, We should know who is coming  in to the Country
@POTUS how many times are u going to have to overturn a reckless EO?!?! IMPEACH. HIM.
@clairerushh @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS They talk a good game, then they follow Trump like happy puppies.


bipartisanship! It can work!
and set up a constant call for Bannon's head while you are awake
@POTUS  I do hope you will. We need to see some strength from DC!Thank you for supporting us
So we're just going to pretend the president didn't tweet an unhinged rant at y'all?
#courage #integrity #NotAPartisanIssue @SenThomTillis @SenatorBurr @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
Please do not forget about Russia and conflicts of interest. He's screwed.
Please work together!
Can you confirm or refute that some detained at Dulles are being sent to detention centers?
The ban will expire before you people agree on a piece of legislation...ANY legislation.
thank you!!!! You are heroes!
thank you from Colorado, seek support from @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner @RepJaredPolis
@POTUS Watch what they DO. #NotNormal They know he is #UnfitToLead
I didn't think #bipartisanship and #compromise existed in the #senate. #provemewrong
don't bail him out.  This is a tactic... overreach to get cooperation on something less. Don't help him.
nice strong statement. But your Republican friends are not on board. Goes nowhere.
Yes, Senators! #RemoveBannon #NoBanNoWall #NoMuslimBan #defendtheconstitution
is it possible to do something besides make statements? This monster won't stop. Save us.
@POTUS please do work together! The American people count on you.
It'd be great if you guys could overturn this administration. 
Can you just overturn the POTUS?
Better to be apolitical than amoral. Your leadership is needed now more than ever.
please also remember we MUST block Devos.
GET THIS DONE!!!
@POTUS tell them to rebuke Trump while they're at it
those two could pull other Republicans across the aisle
