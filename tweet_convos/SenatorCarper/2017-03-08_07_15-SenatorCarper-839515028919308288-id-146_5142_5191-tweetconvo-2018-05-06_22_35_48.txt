This is so sad. It's like watching your parents argue over cooking dinner and destroying food in the process.
because their rich donors want the tax cuts they payed for its all about the donors not us
so if I want  our politicians to not be corrupted by donor money and serve americans.
and belive in equality and economic prosperity for everyone that makes me commie
Is there a 'rogue AMA,' and if not, why not?
DOCTORS AND NURSES NEED TO SPEAK UP!!!we take care of everyone!
it s honor and obligation.
# leave the poor medicaid assistance programs alone. # Hands off MEDICARE
@LeslieMarshall did they support Obamacare shame on them if they did they are irrelevant
Even doctors and @AmerMedicalAssn are noping out on this plan.
ACA replacement, as written, is not a bill the AMA can support -- reductions in coverage are too critical a flaw. http://spr.ly/60198XN3H  
it is an entitlement program.  It should be scrapped and let the free market prevail
dumbbell

All news orgs not reporting that specifically People WITH Coverage will be charged higher premiums w/ pre-existing GOP Bill
Please send representatives to news orgs and explain what's not being explained. Thank you
Price wants to privatize Medicare w his nonsensical premium support vouchers!U better oppose or lose thousands more doctors
younger doctors are more compassionate &egalitarian than You fat kats in support of women, gays and mental illness&coverage
unless AMA speaks up LOUD and clear against Price and Lyin Ryan alternate Trumpcare  plan you will lose all credibility!!!
- No more health insurance! We need medicare care. Medicare or nothing at all. No forced insurance needed!!!!
@AndyGurmanMD The 'coverage gains' under ACA won't last. Want to expand coverage? Stop the ACA from strangling the economy!
Bravo! I am one of THOSE old disabled women they wish would just crawl in a hole & die. Not if I can count on you! Thx!
Then why did you endorse Tom Price?
Why do they want to #destroy th #ACA, greatest gift 2 #America since #Medicare & #Medicaid? Because it saves lives? #cruel
dear AMA: is it ok for Dr. Price to lie?
thank you, please stand strong against this legislation!  We all deserve healthcare.  #ProtectOurCare
@POTUS @foxandfriends - After 8 years the AMA has not a single proposal. Just chronic criticism.
Get the GOP to comply w/Art I, Sect 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution of the USA & do their job which they refuse to do.
I can not listen to another lying Repuke bullshitting over the ACA.  Where are the Dems refuting the #'s?
@Roxy4080 #LeaveObamaCareAlone #LeaveObamaCareAlone #LeaveObamaCareAlone #LeaveObamaCareAlone #LeaveObamaCareAlone  .
they do not speak for physicians. Aca was horrible. They don't listen
special interest gp, may have reduced revenues with Obamacare Repeal & Replacement. Act Now!!! @AndreyOstrovsky
@linnyc123 ACA & GOP half-aSsed replacement effort R NOT COMPLETE - they ignore acupuncture,chiropractic & naturopathic :-(
trump promised to give every American coverage. Just another lie from this failure of a president
AMA aided and abetted Criminal POTUS Obama in passing his health insurance scam.
It's a 3 step process to fix it
#ShutUp
@AndreyOstrovsky DJT said replace with better plan. So if Trumpcare reduces coverage, not what was promised.
THANK YOU!  Thank you for trying to protect the American people from this travesty! #NoACARepeal
Since GOP thinks of themselves as Drs, I wonder if this will matter to them.  Not Scientists tho when it comes to climate.
@JumpTheRework Another ten million votes u guys r putting the party out of business keep going There's a few still with u
republican voters would rather gouge out their eyes then have health insurance.
how about the AMA support and demand single payer.
and what does the AMA know about Medicine? Oh shit. It's in their name.
Thank you. It's about time US physicians said something!
Experts have spoken, GOP congress should listen. @RepKevinBrady
Only thing GOP listens to is the corporations who are paying for their campaigns
@AndreyOstrovsky reduce your charges & make it affordable then
@HMosatche I am #TheResistance
#Trumpcare will cost a lot to fixed-income seniors! @aarp
And with the demolition of the EPA, there WILL be more sick people too.
@MiaFarrow @RepKevinBrady @WaysandMeansGOP DO NOT COME HOME TO TEXAS U WALK ON OUR STREETS. U ARE NOT WELCOME HERE ANYMORE.
nope you rather sit on your asses and whine and cry like lil children instead of taking part in the process like a adult
You guys are just trying to take jobs away from the banks that are full of insurance company profits.
healthcare should be FREE for all. Decent thing to do.
- you should call @MittRomney (ObamaCare's first author) & ask him to push for a bipartisan repair bill.
Romney prob didn't get cab. position bc he wouldn't talk to the Russians #RussiaGate
@robdelaney I DOUBT THE AARP WILL APPROVE OF THIS TAKEDOWN OF AMERICANS, RT
- the AMA is a balanced, bipartisan group.  Please insist the same for any replacement.  Please push for a 60 vote bill!
We, The American people, demand the same healthcare coverage at the same cost that Congress gets!
 #healthcare
Would you support then a single-payer system?
@Song4Jazz #TrumpCare would be a disaster. Seniors paying 50% of their income for premiums is just one part of the disaster
Proves that @Gop is not serious about American's #Healthcare
@SpeakerRyan & @GopLeader recuse ur lifetime #healthcare 1st
.@realDonaldTrump .@SpeakerRyan If doctors can't support ACA "replace" that should tell you something. @AllOnMedicare
@arcillahumeda Wow, the #AMA will not support the new bill...what a shock. The #GOP circus tried to do grown up stuff.
@ANANursingWorld Thank you Doctors  and Nurses of America for standing up for patients! #marchforscience #TheResistance
@washingtonpost @nytimes @Impeach_D_Trump @funder @LawyerRogelio @CNNPolitics @ABC @CBSNews @NewsHour @NBCNews
@G8trz4ever You think Dump gives a damn?...NO!
thank you
The opposition to this BS is absolutely massive. Keep ignoring #TrumpRussia, push people off coverage. #2018
@crazylary51 # It's like buying a car without a gas tank. Worthless.
@Thurgood76 #Trumpcare
.@AmerMedicalAssn Thank you, #AMA! We, the People, want #ACA to be fixed - not repealed! #Obamacare
Trump promised everyone would be covered. He was wrong. Or lied.
.@AmerMedicalAssn What the heck do a bunch of doctors know about medical coverage? Sincerely, Paul Ryan.
Ummm,didn't you offer up your support of price?You knew he wanted to destroy affordable access to health care. Now????
Thank you for speaking up on the issue. Much needed.
even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Shout out to the @AmerMedicalAssn for speaking out! #SaveACA
@TheTobster111 quite correct.
plainly put, if the AMA doesn't support "Chumpcare" - it ain't happening.
Paul Ryan, you had ONE job.......
THANK YOU @AmerMedicalAssn @delblaura
So it's ok that people like me can't afford insurance anymore thanks to the #ACA?
TY, if only you had taken a bolder stand during the election.
@jodotcom also consider the 400 million gift to insurance co CEO. Do we need to make the rich richer. Don't think so
damn...when the medical association can't support ur healthcare bill...rurow..someone fu

What's your stance on this @AAPAorg ? We need to stand up for our patients!
thank you...where are you on this, @ANANursingWorld ?
We oppose the #AHCA as written.  http://www.nursingworld.org/ANA-AHCA-OppositionLetter …
thank you!
@POTUS @SpeakerRyan Listen to the AMA. They RARELY criticize the establishment. Also, can GOP do anything without ENTITLEMENTS for the RICH?
@SpeakerRyan @SenateDems @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump  GOP will lose "BIGLY" in '18 & '20 most don't support this plan!
@SenateDems do not allow this bill to pass!! Help us, please!
but what if they let you KEEP your iPhone?
@realDonaldTrump Is this another win, Donny? Are we winning yet? People who understand the issues never side with you. #sad
It's ok, many do support.
@AARP Against the new Republicare/ trumpcare bill. This bill is a fail @housegop.
Is your doctor hubby also a white nationalist, as evidenced in your bio? ACA isn't a disaster to you, only the "Obama" part.
ACA saves lives. Not a disaster for people too ill & poor to see a doctor. Have a better idea?
Ah what do doctors know about healthcare. Trust the politicians!
@MorticiansAssn gives it 4 stars.
Death Panels indeed!
@SpeakerRyan are you listening?  Do you even care? #midterms
@ezlusztig #StopPresidentBannon
Thanks for speaking up!
doctors hate ACA - you should represent them not your political views
Hope AMA, @ahahospitals are getting members alerted stat as Ryan's trying to rush this turkey through in a week or 10 days!
Obamacare=ACA affordable care act. RyanTrumpcare=UCA unaffordable care act. Plunked US. Great plans, you can't afford.
it's a good plan,AMA supported Obamacare which is sinking on its own,
How the #ACA Was Sabotaged by a Hostile, Obstructionist #RepublicanCongress #ObamacareLite http://go.shr.lc/2mk80wI 
Thank you
But this is what you get by supporting Tom Price, MD for Health Secretary, this is his plan. The damage is unavoidable now.
's rejection is premature & sounds like ur playing politics."as many as 10 mil Americans COULD lose coverage"they can't pay4
I've worked on legislation. As proposed bills go thru amendments, the bill's text changes.
ICYMI: Spicer just pretty much said your opinions mean nyet. Only 'real doctors' matter.
congrats-you are showing real leadership in protecting patients! Keep and improve #ACA
@EricZorn Unaffordable Care Act.  Good luck taking away those subsidies.
@SenateDems ,hi,pits doctor against govt in 1° dutay of care to sick people who live in a publum service democracy rights1°
@SenateDems   Even doctors can't get behind this and they are the biggest beneficiaries!!
Nope, biggest beneficiaries will be Insurance companies & their CEOs. Oh and the filthy rich.
Too many Crooks spoil the Broth! 
@SenateDems AMA could improve Medicaid outcomes by mandating every physician dedicate 10% of practice 2 Medicaid patients
Grow a pair and put some lobbying effort behind Single Payer. That is what PATIENTS NEED. I'll join again if you do.
u see unfit uneducated unlicensed work on it! Frauds racketeering conspiracy blood supply in 86.? Till now©™®
Then why did you endorse Tom Price?  You lost every ounce of credibility you ever had.
ama dem party
#DonDon'tCare
.@AmerMedicalAssn @SenateDems 

This is all on Dems. I'd let it implode and bury all of you. Then fix it. Then it's all on Dems.
That strategy is over. You guys are in charge and Trimp and the GOP own everything.
You guys gripes and promised a magically perfect health plan to replace the ACA. Where is it!
Thank you
supports strengthening insurance companies. You aren't my voice.
Strange that the minority should decide the fate of the country. You aren't our voice either.
NO FUCKING SHIT.
As a physician myself I whole heartedly support this position. #AHCA as it currently stands is not patient centered.
@JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @jasoninthehouse @marcorubio NO ONE supports, except u who accept special int $$$
AMA supported obamadoesntcare, doctors have left AMA because of liberalism.
A handbook for the wealthy and how to screw the 99%
That would be DUMOCRATS and DICKtator obama who shoved obamadoesntcare down our throats.
Lol. @AmerMedicalAssn You also endorsed this disaster obamacare?
It's not a disaster. 90 percent of Americans covered and costs slowed. Right direction
Thank you @AmerMedicalAssn joins for standing up for rights of low income Americans!
AMA doesn't give a shit about low income Americans.
