If there were even 2,000, 5,000 protesters in every major city, that is a small percentage of the population
@julie_cappiello @SenatorCarper @SenateDems He's doing what he promised he would do & there is millions of Americans backing him

Illegal Immigrants and Refugee's are bankrupting America.Finally a President that places America's SAFETY  FIRST!
this is not only AMERICAN to take precautions it is the JOB of our President to DO EXACTLY THIS WITH DANGER!
-Thank you for standing up for what is right!
Thank you for taking this stand against Trump's bullying.  More to come - Resist!
Trump was elected because Washington doesn't work. Please get to work approving Trumps cabinet picks.

From people who have demonstrated betrayal of American values as well as our own foreign policy? THIS IS A JOKE!

#MinistryOfLove
Something already in place but enforced. Bush stated it after 9/11 Obama made some changes. Get ur facts right.
thank you for doing the right thing!
You dummies are more worried about a few refugee's fealings than you are about our safety. Get over it! Go Trump!
Then do something! Withhold consent on senate activity until ban is lifted!!!!
This is nothing more than political posturing if y'all don't filibuster his SC nominee. @SenatorCarper @SenateDems
My view of the Capitol tonight alongside @SenateDems and hundreds of people standing up against the un-American #MuslimBan. #RefugeesWelcome 
If your senator is marching but does nothing to obstruct Trump & his nominees, they are a part of the problem. @SenateDems
Call them. Write them. Tell them they have to do more than march. @SenateDems
I ask how is Trump wrong for Protecting America? Never will Vote Democrat . Get to work and do the job 
#NoToSessions #NoToTrump  Start impeachment and try Bannon for #Treason
Maybe Starbucks new refugee employees can deliver them some coffee. #MAGA

Great to see solidarity. Need to get Republicans to back America instead of Trump. Please build a some bridges!
#StandUpToTrump
Thank you Senator, 3 cheers to all of you! I was wondering how many turned out.
Please talk to colleagues about Tillerson.  He is so unacceptable W/ his friendly ties to Putin & oil interests
Don't Confirm sessions
#AMERICA DOES NOT WANT #MUSLIM #REFUGEES .
STAY IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY.
WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT
It is NOT a Muslim ban, dummy.
Where I see nothing! Senator Tommy Carper! You're Fired!
The #protesters do not in any way represent the city/state populations they are protesting in.
Go home and quit deflecting from the real issues in America. This rioting game is old! No one cares anymore
: go back to you hovel ..
What a beautiful scene?
Remember folks these protesters are actually a small percentage of the population.
Thank you Tom.
It's the same as obama's ban. Professional protestors paid for by @georgesoros No one is buying it. God bless! 
plz # withholdconsent until this ban is revoked and Bannon is off the NSC.
Beautiful pic of Capital and democracy
(1) Thank you for your efforts, and (2) Please vote NO on Sessions and  NO on the rest of the cabinet.
Thank you Senator for your commitment. We support you 100% #WeAreTheResistance #WeAreAllImmigrants #StopTrumpNow
Beautiful building and even more beautiful people.
Give 'em hell, Tom.
