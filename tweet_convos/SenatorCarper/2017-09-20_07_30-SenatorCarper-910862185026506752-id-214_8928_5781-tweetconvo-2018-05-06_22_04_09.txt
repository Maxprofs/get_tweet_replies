Can I ask for the source for this? I want to retweet it everywhere but want to be accurate. Thank you.
Center for American Progress, I believe
Yep, I put this together with help from my colleagues at CAP
Thank you! It's a simple question: today my son doesn't face PEC discrimination; under this bill, is it possible? They know that's a YES.
they know it’s yes, that is why they are dodging the question.
There we go.....fixed it for him.

Potential cost increases by state:
- AK: $31,790
- AZ: $22,074
- ME: $16,437…
Someone should file complaint to have @BillCassidy 's med lic revoked for violation of Hippocratic Oath attempting harm ppl.#GrahamCassidy
You mean he is lying?
@BillCassidy is lying to his constituents and all Americans. He refuses to tell the truth.
Can you get this all over tv?
What did you think @BillCassidy would do he's a liar and a liar will lie
The tweet he deleted today.
The media gives a free pass to this bullshit!

Because I preexist I will B the ones that die NONE of these R for pain or mood elevated drugs Just a day in the life 
Lying Cassidy! DISGUSTING!
Myth is a generous term for what he’s saying compared to reality
(yes, those that turned down Medicaid funding under ACA because they were just against anything Obama).  Eliminate Medicaid in ten years. 2/
Just another example of people more concerned with their power than the wellbeing of people.
I've been saying the same thing! I thought I was the only one....
Get over artist. Just like his boss.
You're the one lying about the bill. You just yell racist, hate this group, hate that group, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare without facts
Cassidy is a liar
FIND TIME TODAY TO MAKE THOSE PHONE CALLS! CALL AS MANY GOP SENATORS ALL PHONE NUMBERS ON LINE. OPPOSE THIS CRUEL VILE BILL #GrahamCassidy
And if you don't think this will affect your #healthcare through work, think again. All bets are off and the state can rule as it pleases.
It is great that you lie to cover up a hateful Obamacare system that destroyed healthcare. All you seem to do is lie.
@phillyfansrule @BillCassidy   Lies and double talk, anything to wipe out Obama name
@SenatorCassidy  is candy coating this horrible bill. https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/GrahamCassidy.aspx ….  even bi partisan CONSUMER REPORTS opposes   NO to G-C
Yeah the bill sucks but he is just continuing the parade of politicians of all stripes who lack understanding but believe doing right thing
Unfortunately we are now stuck in the BUSINESS of healthcare instead of actually caring about heath... #wearedoomed #dontdrinkthecoolaid
Shared but no credit noted for creator.  Is that you?
RT this to every news outlet that's hosting his Misrepresentation Tour and call them out if they're letting him lie abt his trash Bill.
We are GOV. by an Incompetent-Lying-Deranged-Habitual Liar-Who’s being Protected by Corrupt Repubs. Determined to impose Fascist Laws.
Repubs. are acting out of desperation since to date they haven’t Passed  & their Donors are Pissed-They can’t Pass Rich Tax Breaks w/ACA
Retweet & pass this along to Everyone.
Why isn't this group getting  word out via media outlets that he's taking $8.4B from US giving Texas 3X's that & how IT will effect ELDERLY?
How do these people sleep at night?
And AARP just estimated GC will cost people 50+ $16,000 more/yr. The result, many won't be able to keep ins. or will have poorer coverage.
@realDonaldTrump  READ THE BILL  PLEASE B/4 U TWEET
Thank you! Very helpful!
@SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski See below 
#GrahamCassidy copy that to Johnson too. He set himself on fire just now with his lying to Morning Joe
@BillCassidy is doing all he can for 31 Washington healthcare lobbyists to make sure 31,000,000 Americans lose health insurance. #CBOSCORE
Sounds as though he didn’t read/doesn’t understand his own bill. Or he’s a liar.
Steal from the poor, give to the rich.
I
NOT "grossly misrepresenting". He is LYING.
@BillCassidy is all over TV, gross.
So what if my condition isn't covered where I live in say FLA but is in NV? I gotta move away from my family or die? Will NV even cover me?
Remember this in 2018: for GOP, repealing anything that Obama put in place is more important than the health and wellbeing of millions.
Thank you! Now, if only those who need to hear it would actually listen.
@POTUS please see attached regarding lies Cassidy is putting out about the #GrahamCassidyBill I have a preexisting condition. Ppl will die
Sad part is that the so called journalists on @CNN @ABCNetwork  @NBCNews @MSNBC  @nytimes et al are not fact checking or calling him out
@katelovescolor @BillCassidy i  hope  this  bill  will  lead to the  demise  of the  Republicans.
This is how stupid they think we all are. He can just go on tv all over America spouting pure lies and verbal garbage.
Thanks again for you're incredible tenacity Igor.
@SenSchumer @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems Hi! I know you're REALLY busy. The bill's sponsor has lied about the bill's content.
Except it's not a myth - it's a Bold Lie
It @GOP had solid ideas about healthcare reform they wouldn't fast track a cruddy bill and do dishonest damage control on tv.
This is also called bold face lying @BillCassidy
Addendum to that: if you live in California or New York, you are screwed. They almost defund Healthcare dollars to those populous states.

"grossly misrepresenting?" He is lying. Plain and simple.
@realDonaldTrump   READ THIS.
So did GOP decide no one knows anything about this guy so let's put his name on it because Jimmy Kimmel had him on?
Bogus @BillCassidy and his bill of lies! The American people deserve better than your mediocrity!
Sad that the GOP and followers don't care about facts...they care about upstaging the last president while getting paid to do it
At this point @BillCassidy is devoid of honesty and integrity with his lies to the American people. #JimmyKimmelTest  Defeat #GrahamCassidy.
Call them what they are.  Not "myths."  LIES.
Why won't they wait for the CBO score? Yep, it's that bad.
Its really all about how much money can a campany take in and use for anything else but healthcare, bonuses, big salaries, kickbacks....
U need to pay more for being sick, isnt that what we are purchasing, something to help pay for when we are sick
Yes. An extra $100,000 a year seems reasonable to pay when you have cancer.
Why is anyone paying for a product they cannot use, where companies dont want u to use it
Maybe we should call it healthcare non coverage since companies dont want to pay for any kind of care
#GrahamCassidy #GrahamCassidyBill No protection for preexisting conditions and no more Medicaid money for LA. Millions lose healthcare! Sad!
Cassidy and Graham will just keep lying because they think we're all too stupid to figure out their brilliant plan to kill millions of us.
Prove it. Not with ideological BS rhetoric, alt facts or diverting whataboutisms. With truths. Tangible truths.
Mr Cassidy, could you please reply to each bullet if you disagree? This  Will have to substitute for CBO analysis or open debate.
And to be clear and transparent, I am a Constituent.
Wouldn't expect anything else from a #RepubLIEcan.
Pre existing conditions must not be changed. We all have a pre existing conditions.
@BillCassidy is a #Liar
Welcome to the Trump Administration.
Underqualified, understaffed, unconscionable, unacceptable. Period. #Bullseye
You can call it a myth but what Cassidy is doing is blatant lying.
Saw @BillCassidy lie, lie, and lie some more on CNN. Wtf? The entire @GOP has adopted lying as a means of passing legislation? #GOPTreason
Thank you, this is wonderful. And Thx Jimmy K. For exposing this fraud.
Casssidy UR a Cat 5 Hurricane to 92% of America in UR prioritizing of a political win at the expense of UR employees/USA electorate's lives.
I see no problem with any of this. I think healthcare belongs in the private sector and we need to reduce government spending on it
You're losing the gish gallop; the rebuttals are 5x-10x longer than his lies. Shorten the truth to be media friendly.
Ugh. Why haven't we learned to communicate reality as well as they communicate fiction?
Thank You
@SenCapito Here's the real scoop on #GrahamCassidy. VOTE NO!
@SenBobCorker Here's the real scoop on #GrahamCassidy.
@senrobportman Here's the real scoop on #GrahamCassidy.
He's not "misrepresenting", he's LYING.
They're not "myths", they're LIES.

C'mon Igor, grow a pair and call a spade a spade.
@SenSusanCollins Here's the real scoop on #GrahamCassidy.
@SenJohnMcCain Here's the real scoop on #GrahamCassidy.
@lisamurkowski Here's the real scoop about #GrahamCassidy.
Nice work. Thank you for putting this together.
Thank you for this. Do you have a version with citations?
Thanks for sharing this, Mark. I may have missed it otherwise.
@RBReich would you mind RTing this chart to fight #GrahamCassidy ?
I want people to tell the truth, if your policy is unaffordable then you don't have coverage and who in America doesn't have PE conditions.
@BillCassidy @jimmykimmel @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenCoryGardner 
See The Truth
.@BillCassidy  DAMN, you're EMBARRASSING US. 

#SignedLOUISIANA
Hey @BillCassidy, guess what? 

#SenCassidyIsALiar
Right hand column is labeled incorrectly.....should be CAP Myth...the truth is always somewhere in between..
Thank you for giving us the facts @igorvolsky! @BillCassidy, you lie!
If his pregnant teen daughter Meg had complications in childbirth that required emergency surgery of Gchild, what would Bill have done?
And if a state applies for a waiver, and includes any language stating it will make an effort to ensure coverage, it must be granted.
Cassidy myths are legendary.
GOP learned from Trump that you can straight up lie w/ 0 accountability. They will continue that strategy unless voted out in 2018.
May I add that I am supremely pissed-off at this lying tool @BillCassidy for having the name as an awesome Dead tune and one of my dogs.
How can you lie so hard about your bill's content and still have a job?
That is like, your main fucking job.
@BillCassidy
@OlympiasList @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain Thank you for this information. Hopefully Sen McCain's call for regular order will be considered
Sen. Cassidy doesn't mind lying to the American people, or shall we say, failing to tell the truth, but still takes his $174K salary from us
Thank you for this!
If reducing the population numbers is the goal then they're right on track. I can see fewer babies bc nobody can afford increased premium
Does he not realize that if people lose loved ones because of his bill, they will come for him?
Highly misleading. And, sick people pay more. How controversial!Ever had a car accident?What happens to rates.Unfortunate? yes, but reality!
Stating that ppl w. pre-existing conditions will have "affordable" coverage is an exceptional lie. Why do this?
Saying they'll have "access" to a vaguely defined "coverage" is classic deal with Devil language. The Devil's better than these guys.
The Devil's like "I'll give you $1 billion for your soul." GOP is "you'll get $1 billion & it totally won't be bc your wife dies tragically"
#GrahamCassidy ends #Medicaid in TEN YRS. Elderly nursing? Working poor, mid-class elder parents, disabled, children on & on? @RoyBlunt
It's perhaps foolishly kind of you to call these "myths," rather than "lies."
@RepTomPrice @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr #ACASavesLives @BillCassidy #trumpcare2 @LindseyGrahamSC
Cassidy's teen daughter Meg got pregnant at 17. Would Cassidy have denied her kid emergency care if baby had complications & not his kid?
@dumptrump1234 @BillCassidy HE'S  mfn, lyin scumfuck 
Glutton
Over
Poverty mfn sob!! Believe his shitvat your peril!!
@BillCassidy  You have the power to ensure healthcare for everyone yet you choose not to. What kind of person works so hard to hurt people?
.@lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @RandPaul Don't believe their lies!  #VoteNOGrahamCassidy #KillTheBill
My senator (:
The Senator is using wishful thinking that states will not use powers vested in them by this bill. If they didn't, he might be right. But…
Shared on Facebook. Thanks.
@BillCassidy  w/o universal healthcare, US is the most primitive of Western countries, a kleptocracy in the making. You help to make it so.
He is NOT misrepresenting. He is LYING.  .@BillCassidy is a LIAR who cares more about his handlers than his constituents. Period.
I want to see all journalists find the "families" who pay $40,000 a year premiums under ACA. I call BS. Cen WI.- gold plan-/No sub.=$850/mo.
@BillCassidy  We are only western country that doesn't guarantee healthcare coverage for its people, whose lawmakers seek to take it away.
A liar is a liar!!
That's what politicians do to sell their agendas.
Gives this to democrats they could use some talking points for a change
@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC LIARS!!!!!!!!!
How do you look yourself in the mirror Sen. Cassidy? You know the truth. God knows the truth. You're killing me. Literally.
Pls share this widely too
and this
Here is a more detailed chart of what preexisting conditions could cost under the repeal bill.

I'm reading that @billcassidy is openly lying to other senators now even. Is that considered acceptable? Is that a common practice?
He is not far out of line compared to the other senators who are just as evil. Did we get a CBO score with the truth?
Hell no, apparently there's not enough time to get a CBO score.
Yup - they'll have a CBO score that outlines costs, but nothing on coverage losses bc it won't be ready in time. Process-smocess. Damn them.
Sharing and retweeting
Thank you @igorvolsky  #VoteNOGrahamCassidy @BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @GOP @senrobportman GREED Over Ppl #Inhumane 
#Votethemout2018
Or how about your table comparing conservative criticisms/objections to O-Care pre-enactment w/ O-Care's actual performance.
I'd like to see your myth/fact table debunking O's repeated "keep your doctor, keep your plan," etc. lies about O-Care.
I'd like to see you and your family developing pre-existing conditions after ACA is repealed.
What's the main difference between Dems and GOP? Dems actually try to help people while GOP is all about $$$
Is he a republican?  'Nuff said.
The main reason the GOP is pushing this is for the $$$ the Koch brothers have promised but ONLY if they repeal Obamacare.
Call all your Republican officials and tell them you’ll them responsible for what the GOP does to health care in Congress.  Today.
Cassidy should lose his medical license because no real doctor would ever do this to so many people. Shame on Bill Cassidy!
Is this why you tell us the benefits & don't link to your own bill so we can read it ourselves?

I got your back: http://bit.ly/2wZkUYw 
GOP is the NEW WHITE SURPREMIST PARTY...
Loving the ratio on this tweet!!
@marcorubio please pay attention!  Do not vote for a lie #GRAHAMCASSIDY
Sen. Rubio, vote NO on #GrahamCassidy
#GrahamCassidyBill yet another move by @SenateGOP to offer cruel, expensive & exclusionary #Wealthcare to others.
Dr. Death should read this. May help him understand his own disasterous bill.
Thank you, but these are lies, not myths.
Where the hell are the Democrats?
I'm not sure what you mean. The D's are minority in both Senate (close) and House (not close). They have no power here.
They need to be all over tv attacking this bill. We need more than just Jimmy Kimmel.
@ChrisCuomo @JoeNBC @maddow @ChrisHayesTV @Lawrence maybe this truth chart will help
Lying, lying to the American people.  Shame on the doctor.
Is this on Facebook?
Cassidy should be sued for malpractice.
If they don't pass this Koch money unavailable........call, call, call, #VoteNoGrahamCassidy
They (GOP) will say ANYTHING at this point just to get Donnie a win regardless of how many millions of innocent people hurt in the process
All he cares about is that sweet, sweet Koch Bros. money #shameful

Faux doctor. No doctor would push this heinous bill.
We see you. You can't lie your way out of facts.
I missed your fact sheet on Obama's lies. Eg. 'If you like your plan you can keep it' and 'premiums will fall $2500 for all'
.@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @senrobportman @SenFlakeStaff Don't punish folks who voted for you. Lead us, don't bleed us.
'You can fool all of the ppl some of the time,' but if yr talking GOP HC, you'll probably need to lie, cuz what you're doing isn't popular.
Media needs it ....can't just allow he said, she said.
Can we call it a Lies/Facts table?
@SenateGOP @SenateGOP  @BillCassidy is lying all over the place.
GOP lies it's who they are. @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @lisamurkowski @SenTedCruz
Ever wonder why people like Ca$$idy get into medicine?
More lies from the GOP. This is the best they can come up with all this time? Such incompetence!!!
This shouldn't provide ANYONE COMFORT!!! Obviously, not meant to really cover,protect or provide HEALTHcoverage as a right bt as a commodity
GOP are some sick, vile "people". To straight out lie to Americans knowing this can adversely affect mils of people, all for a "win", is BS!
This wa posted this am by Lindsey Graham 2/ end
A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution. 1/

@BillCassidy is a liar plain and simple
