oppose #GrahamCassidy quick tweet senators here http://www.factpower.org/healthcare-tweetstorm.html … then call/email using http://www.factpower.org/calltoactionhealthcare.html …
@SenBobCorker @SenBobCorker If the governors say the States don't want this, why are you pushing for it?  Who is the money behind this?
BUT WILL THEY VOTE FOR IT?
Their votes don't count. If repealed and states/people start feeling impact trump care they and trump will be voted out of office
CONSIDER THIS- it might be impossible to disprove that ANY CONDITION wasn't to some extent "pre-existing"  WHAT A VILE CON  #impeachtrumpnow
GOP'S are getting enough calls, etc. to realize that this would make sure that  NONE of them would be VOTED for in 2018.
Guess they'll have to get their millions of Koch dollars some other way.  I'm sure they will!
@MaryFallin OK to lose millions when we are already in the red? lose rural hospital care? higher infant mortality?
Still playin RESIST card, lol insted of joining to help voters wit healthcare,  whc yall screwed us with (obamacare) , push to DIVIDE, sad
YES!  Please #ProtectOurCare
Vast majority of you shitsacks voted for defense department expansion & protection of Apartheid Israel on our dime. (D- Jerusalem)
I will move my family to a state that will make single payor law in that state. R's are creating a civil war within our country
#FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal #FullRepeal Get Gov out of H-care!
no..get profit motive out of healthcare..CEOs buy new mansions and yachts will deciding to kill others
Nothing survives or improves without "profit" /  benefits / reason 4 working. Don't confuse profit with greed.
HMOs profit takes the ability to provide healthcare to everyone. highest infant mortality rate is in the US & lowest life expectancy too
Just amazing how these people look in a mirror. Make them eat where we eat and this would never happen! Grow some balls Democrats!
But New Jersey citizens do support it...well the ones of us actually paying for our healthcare do, the freeloaders don't
I have stage 4 breast cancer and am on disability. With only one income, we can barely afford my premiums. With this new one, I would die---
If Graham & Cassidy believe in their bill, will they waive their cushy govt. healthcare & claim to Medicare? Let them live/die w/their bill!
At 79 I physically cannot take care of my lovely wife of 54 years if funds are cut off 4 her care in MA. It could finish off both of us.
causing killing off those poor people is what the #gop stand for! take a bow motherfuckers!

Fine but reduce the rising costs of healthcare by stopping these doctors & hospitals charging $300 for saline solution. Among other things
If they put a cap on pharmaceutical co's, it would bring premiums way down too!
Clinton cult is controlling that. What would ppl do if they found out she's also stopping life saving drugs from being produced...look it up
At least they are Republicans with sense. Kasich tries to take the high road when it comes down to his constituents and poverty.
Crickets for IL gov Bruce Rauner. He's a coward. @GovRauner
Then don't vote for it!!!
We #Americans pray #GodBlessAmerica everyday #DemocracyDay #PROTECTOURCARE #SaveACA #ObamaCare 
vs #CassidyGraham #GrahamCassidy #TRUMPCARE!
@senate GOP @housegop @SenateMajLdr  @SpeakerRyan @LindseyGrahamSC  many of your last terms. We will do our best. U r killing people.
Only those paid by Koch do https://twitter.com/geoffreylaxton/status/910280966714937344 … now u get why they want to pass this!!??!!
Americans need to protest the Kochs: Koch network 'piggy banks' closed until Republicans pass health and tax reform.
https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP SHOUL NOT SUPPORT THIS VICIOUS SND DANGEROUS BILL EITHER!  #RejectGrahamCassidyBill
I don't support any of you forcefully taking my money to give to idiots who made bad life choices
Do the #GOP governors hold any sway over the senators from their state?
Would it help if we called our governors?
It won't for me
I'm in WI
Well make it better then fellas. Gee. U are Congress u know. Or do u know?

How Graham-Cassidy redistributes federal money

https://www.axios.com/vitals-2486505861.html … 
My life depends on keeping my ACA insurance.
Me, too.. 
Me 3... 
Well, Arizona Gov does.
Doug Douchebag
It'll take all that Obama money away.
Affordable healthcare for EVERY American. We earned it and DESERVE it.
Republicans and their inhumane approach is as bad as ISIS.
Sorry I can't hear you, I'm a little busy right now.
Can't wait for this to pass!!!
You want america to continue supporting an illegal failing ACA? You offer nothing but words...nothing!
clowns in Washington..especially loser democrats....why would any1 want these guys in charge of your healthcare
They may not look like Devils but they are.
First rescind the law that violates our civil rights.go from there.No government healthcare.why are they even involved.
Time's up for giving this President the benefit of any doubt. 
Resist isn't enough. Actively, loudly oppose. RT!
Until you take over the Majority of Govs Shut Up. #GrahamCassidy #trumpcare #racism You cannot even beat out a Racist Incompetent @potus
Keep strong for us. The Country is depending on you.
This bill is garbage.
Healthcare & education is best managed closer to the communities that utilize it. Each state, county, city, family knows their needs best.
since when did democrats ever support anything that didn't first come out of Schumer's mouth?
This is worse than previous Trump care.  The GOP's last-ditch Obamacare repeal bill may be the worst one yet http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-graham-cassidy-20170918-story.html …
#DO not screw us!!
Convince McCain that his governor does t support it or we're done.
Do you know the difference between puppies and democrats? 

Puppies quit whining after six months! 
Dems never stop! Lmao
Let's hope @SenDeanHeller says no as well.
#ProtectOurCare
Republicans are like rats trying to find another way to get in our houses and cause mischief!
No Republican voted for obamacare ..lets face it you're really not that bright are u?..the only people who have taken away HC..are democrats
Tell AZ Governor.
#RepealACAnow #IllegalTax #ObamaSaidItWasntATax #ThenSaidItWasToCourt
Really? Check w Arizona...
Call  up, protest in the street, send emails.
NO! Just, No!

Unfortunately McCain's decision is partly based on Arizona Gov
My statement on #GrahamCassidy #RepealAndReplace 
@LindseyGrahamSC if u pass this u will be more hated than Trump. I used to respect you, no more. You're evil and small and have no heart! 
Neither do we, the American people! Premiums go sky high, no pre-existing cover, Medicare ends, lifetime caps. Hell no. This is not on.
Please get Gov of Arizona @dougducey dougon board to resist this deceitful promise of repealing #ACA
WRONG
WRONG
WRONG
WRONG

--AZ RESIDENT
@LindseyGrahamSC you've become a sad excuse of a man. How can you sleep at night knowing millions of Americans will wake up w/no healthcare?
Thank you, @MassGovernor.
Come up w/a solution & quit bitching!!
Please stop calling people names...not racists, but rather patriots
#MAGA #Trumpcare vs #ProtectOurCare The Only Thing You Do Support Is Backed By #TheHouseOfObama Lack Of Transparency
@SenateGOP Many who voted Republican don't want this bill. Be human beings and vote NO
spoiler alert!!!  YOU don't agree with the President. WOW
The people that elected Trump DO support #RepealAndReplace. You all have elections coming up as well. We will make sure you know our choice!
Vote Democrat in all upcoming Governor elections
Once again they are wrapping it up with a pretty bow but filling the box with a pile of CRAP...
Recycled #SkinnyCare #Cheapycare shame on #Graham and #Gillipsie for sneaking another takeaway; vote them out! @SenateDems
Ha..gop support getting rid of ACA..no wonder democrats can't win elections..they think people r happy with obamacare
Why is this Not VIRAL!!!
#TrumpcareSucks
if the gop will not do their job on single care health for all americans.then it is time for voters to take control.voters will decide/FACT.
Of course you don't support it, the only bill you would support is 100% government control of Healthcare. (So do communist)
They also blasts Obamacare as unsustainable, high cost and no healthcare.
When is Democrats going to Get a Bill going ? I'm a Democrat and Love to see Our Party Do something !
Both parties are out of ideas.The dems are waiting to be swept into power in 2018, no need to do anything
That's why HRC lost. Complacency !! #ProtectOurCare  Dems need to get off their *sses @dscc
Just repeal ACA and let free market competition fix this. If the Gov is involved it will suck. Always does!
Yep...
#ProtectOurCare
Senate Democrats don't support anything...but obstructionism. #idiots
Remember John McCain casted the final vote against Trumpcare. He's a Republican.
Pay your fair share.
#VoteGrahamOut #VoteCassidyOut #VoteThemOut
#VoteGrahamOut #VoteCassidyOut #VoteThemOut #bothtrash
We are fighting with you
While you're at it, you ALL need to get behind #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer.
Senate Dem's only seek the destruction of American Democracy for they are radical socialists who deceive/lie/obfuscate/domestic terrorists!
Getting rid of that TURD legislation @BarackObama jammed down this nations throats is all that the public wants! We don't need gov health!
You obviously have no health problems or grandchildren who do. #ProtectOurCare

Tell the truth that Obamacare is hurting Americans
