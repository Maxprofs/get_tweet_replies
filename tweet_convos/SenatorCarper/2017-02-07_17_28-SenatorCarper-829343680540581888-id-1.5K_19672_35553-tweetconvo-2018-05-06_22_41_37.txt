Everybody in the Cabinet and Executive Office is unfit to even walk a dog
Blanket statements equal uneducated morons.
Warren=Idoit
Days into Black History Month, @SenateGOP tried to silence words of Coretta Scott King (via @SenWarren @motherjones)
You are wrong about that. And Mr. Sessions will be confirmed
Her front looks just like her back. #RobinWilliams
I USED TO BE A DEMOCRAT AFTER LISTEN TO SENATOR WARREN I VOTED FOR TRUMP! Warren IS ANTI AMERICAN !!
Hope you read it slowly, those REPUBLICANS don't seem too bright..
attacking intelligence of opposite party just gives credible that Dems r elitists.
I served in Intelligence! Not one of these has the I.Q. to graduate the US Intel. Academy!
Nobody cares. Shut up!
@SenateMajLdr that letter was already entered in congressional record & you just said DR MLK's widows words don't matter. #FAIL
it wasn't entered into the record because the racist Strom Thurmond didn't allow it. Read the article.
obviously you're not a racist Mr. But numb so what are you what category do you fall into
I don't explain myself to eggs, sorry.
but you can block them!
Welcome to the 21st Century, 
Liz.
#silenceSenatorWarren
@MissAngeOnAir @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Pocahontas is a lunatic!
He is not rascist.
This man is disgrace for legal profession.

@emilynussbaum @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost they just showed it on MSNBC
AND YOU WERE RIGHT! @SenateMajLdr was UNAMERICAN in his attempt to silence you!
@MitchMcConell 
What was done to @SenWarren tonight was disgraceful.  Free speech and democracy is in peril
You keep it up; she persists is right! Someone named mom persisted for everyone and good thing they did!
Maybe we should read your fake indian cookbook on the Senate floor as well.
This backfired on McConnell. I have now read and forwarded the letter. Powerful stuff! #TheStreisandEffect

#LetCorettaSpeak
@TerrieWilliams @washingtonpost Keep fighting. When u can't fight any more, stand here & fight any how. Song: "WE Are Soldiers!"
@Tribeca @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Warren, you are about as legitimate a leader as @HillaryClinton colluding with @CNN
but Cruz can quote Dr. Seuss?
keep fighting the good fight.
You're a Senator, you all know the rules. You knew you were wrong. They did the right thing.
@washingtonpost please read the definition of populism & encourage everyone to come together in small community
@lampsnotjewelry @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump President Trump is a paranoid man with little hands
Tweet the letter-post it on FB-recirculate it!
We Knew Sessions track record. Republicans times up Democracy will not be Silent! #2018Vote
democracy can handle the reading of a letter or it isn't one #LetLizSpeak
@CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost you knew the consequences of your actions, you rolled the dice, it was calculated
Such disrespect for Sen Warren.
.@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost 1986? Really? Ok... If that is the test. Watch out ...
too bad the GOP infringed on your freedom.of speech to hide the truth.
Because you are phenomenal, Senator Warren. Thank you.
Sessions may try 2 cover up past wrong doings he can't wash them away.Letter frm CSK/witnesses
Thank you for fighting the good fight @SenWarren & speaking on behalf of millions of Americans and #CivilRights
looks like your wanna be a native American ass got tossed out lol.
and I hope that more women seek positions in Congress and the Senate and will not be silenced by
@CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost i hope you remember this when you get majority. #fightfirewithfire
McConnell should be ashamed, stopped her from reading a citizens letter, that's the simple truth
Keep speaking out...we are listening! And we will remember in 2018 & 2020!
NO! This behavior needs to stop and now.
@TheKevinDent @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost It was wrong of them to stop you. Sessions is evil.
embarrassed to have you as my senator. Where are policy's?and why always throw up the race card?
lizzy is a beast I love her
please stop. Mr Sessions from being sworn in.
@CoryBooker @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost Amazing.R's rebuke Warren,but most let DJT's comments outrageous on Russia slide.
#senwarren that was how many years ago??? Was that about the time you claimed to be native Indian!!!!!!
Violation of Free Speech...wrong, wrong, wrong....& Black History Month????
We the people no who stands with us & against us. Keep up the fight & thank you! #TheResistance
@AlvedaCKing MLK’s niece says Elizabeth Warren is improperly taking advantage of King name
Thank you, Sen Warren. Have begged for CSK letter to be read.
#impeachtrump
fauxcohontas has some serious nerve! Thank God they shut her up.
keep fighting for us, Sen. Warren!
@Lawrence @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost The Alt Right or White Supremace are elated they finally will have a racist brother AG
Telling Senator Warren to stop reading a relevant letter about Sessions by Ms. King  is deplorable
Black people do not speak for us , you just need their vote Liberal !
Senate Republicans, will get theirs in 2018.
Shows exactly what Sessions is...against women...radical right...Trumpie puppet!
Thanks so much 4 fighting the good fight! To bad not 1 more repub had the balls to stand with you. #ResistTrump
. I so appreciate you & ur colleagues. Please stay strong for us.
and yet MLKs son and attorney support Trump-believe n his judgement of AG Sessions. #wasteoftime
don't lie, you were warned because of what you read from Ted Kennedy, but you kept going #liar
Because what happened in 1986 is soooo relevant 31 years later.
Hillary praises KKK leader as her mentor and Pocahontas doesn't say a peep.
Sessions used his office to intimidate black voters, Mrs King said. Y wasn't he charged? Jailed?
@Lawrence @SenatorSessions  We believe U should have been able 2 read the letter. We also understand how cantankerous U've become
it's absolutely relevant to this hearing! Shame on you, you old coot @SenateMajLdr
.@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost
you did everything right! Thank you!!
https://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4125116/amp/Martin-Luther-King-s-pro-life-niece-voted-Trump.html?client=safari …
we are with you Elizabeth Warren. Sessions is a weak man will not uphold laws for minorities
I am disgusted by the behavior of the Senators. You are a warrior and I thank you!
What some1 else wrote u uttered in public, and did so 4 transparently political purposes.
McConnell is a disgrace and a discredit to this country.  Thank you, Senator Warren!
@EvaMcBain09 @SenatorSessions @washingtonpost I fully support you!! #carryon
Mr. Sessions, so excited to see one of Satan's crew in such a calling! Sell your soul Buddy!
Republicans, especially Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan need to be voted out.
u should be bared from any public position for good your a 1% paid for joke
#letlizspeak . You better let her speak. She is at the mountain top.
@Your assertiveness,valor and respect are characteristics of a true leader. Thank U for unveiling the truth.
@coralsue3 Thank you Senator Warren for reading King's letter.  O'Connell wanted to silence truth!
intelligent people see through charades. And America is growing more and more intelligent. What will your legacy be? Integrity?
this is a must read senators

sit down and shut up!
Mr. Sessions you will try to  to strip our rights away  but you will cause a blue tsunami!!!!!!!
Join me in retweeting this letter. NO on Session
This is the kind of gotcha moment I've been praying for, endlessly; THANK U - it's a gift - Mitch loses his cool
Cant believe Senate Repubs "dismissed" you, but said nothing during own filibusters for Obama.
I am appalled at Senator McConnell's tactics. He is such a yellow-bellied coward.
What the heck, America?
That's pittance against all the Billionaire Mafia Trump's trying to install!
who cares
@WesleyLowery shame on too old Mitch McConnell and the republicans @senmajldr
The disappointment when you can't say all politicians are self-serving because of inspiring senators like you
.@SenWarren @SenSanders .@SenSchumer @SenBlumenthal .@SenMurphyOffice If Rule XIX is used to Silence the Truth,Senate should #AbolishRuleXIX
They can only silence you on the Senate floor,not on the streets & NEVER to GOD'S MERCIFUL EARS! @SenatorSessions Hell is Hot!
And now the world will read that letter.
Fauxcahontas:  u r so a screech owl!!
Why do #GOP always say women screech, etc? Something wrong, buddy? Closet gay?
Orrin Hatch saying that everyone in the senate needs to "grow up."
@SenateGOP All the more evidence for #TheResistance to take on old white guy Mitchy & his minions. We're pissed!
1)she's been dead 10 years its possible her views changed no? 2) Perhaps your colleagues don't like you?
I am outraged that you were silenced & rebuked & sen Sessions should beg your forgiveness

This is what GOP stand for, get used to it.
Thank you all of the thank yous!
Thank you.
