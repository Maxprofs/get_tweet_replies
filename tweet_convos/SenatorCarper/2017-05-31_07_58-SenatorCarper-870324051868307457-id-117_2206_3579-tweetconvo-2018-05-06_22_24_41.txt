@LeoDiCaprio is pushing Big Oil now! He thinks #Shell & #ExonMobile know better what's good for the planet! #hypocrite #globalist #shill
Keywords here "business leader". Trump's never had the courage to lead. Just a failed businessman who's only solvent from debt/tax writeofs
but point above is many Big Biz WANT Paris accord, and have made strides to lower carbon footprint. Trump doing this cuz of denier base!
even Russia has signed it, Trump's benefactor
Didn't the Dinosaurs die from climate change .. and what about that ice age?? What were these darn animals doing to cause climate changes?!?
No, several mass extinction events - massive asteroid impacts.
disgusting! Most of those businesses don't manufacture and those that do manufacture in communist China, which is exempt for 13 years. #MAGA
Please save us
@realDonaldTrump Global Business Leaders Support the Paris Agreement.....guess you aren't one.  Sad.
Let's check where those companies produce products. More do so in countries that have little or no regulation.
Good for their pocketbook
Corporations colluding with the government - true fascism.

Apple and Facebook on top...
Don't you think some of these organizations played a major role in Planet's destruction? Apparently, they now care about the environment.
Yea, great for the planets economy at the cost of the US's jobs and money, thanks but no thanks.
Global business Leaders fleece taxpayers with the #ParisAgreement , and our elected officials are bribed to support it.
What will the #CelebrityAppresident decide?
@LeoDiCaprio pls come to India to speak on #climatechange to my MBA students @algore @UNFCCC #150 #climateaction #plsRT #ClimateJustice
They environment is they Quality of the product or consumer
All we need is a knowledgeable and compassionate POTUS not businessman seeking to enrich big business easily while endangering the planet.
No. because they know there are big and dirty money to be made. All of sudden the global business leaders are good guys now? seriously?
Russian trolls in the house.
Support!
Global business leader are in favor because they aren't in America and their taxes won't go toward it.
The odds of success are twice as good with the election of the new President.  Olande was an ass and hypocrite.  Greetings! 
@nikkihaley yes we can balance business interests with climate concerns.
Excellent Leadership Leo
It is imperative we stay in the agreement! We need to continue to lead in the world community and work to protect the environment!!
did @POTUS see this? I think he should, otherwise he would be making yet another bad deal.
These business leaders should not back down and take no for an answer.They must make their voices be heard throughout the world .
Seriously oh please  give me a break
Individuals can prioritize the #ParisAgreement with their money too: https://www.openinvest.co/60-second-activist-can-paris-climate-accord/ … There are so many ways to #resist!

Business Leaders not united. Many US Entrepreneurs don't like #ParisAgreement  & these companies need to hire Moderate & Republican Women 
If withdrawal is officially announced, we (people) should move on without T. Because Paris agreement is undebatable
Climate Change is a direct result of Illegal Immigration including slaves
500 years ago (and still counting): Vatican: The world is flat. Yes: Listen to them. Tech should only worry about shareholder value
(2/2) and make products which lasts longer then 3 years + in the vicinity of the customer (and not in CN) + 100% recycled materials
DOW, really? The makers of the most poisonous products in the world.They made Agent Orange, they make round up and chemicals for GMO's.

@POTUS rethink your stance on #ParisAgreement! PLEASE do not remove USA out of agreement our planet depends on it!
Bc becoming a monopoly power on sustainable energy is a good thing. If only more investors realised this.
But trump doesn't give a sh*t about that.
Clean water to drink & clean air to breathe ... the rest of climate change is hyped-up fear mongering, that business investors love.
Now is the time for the international community and the widely recognized to reach out to Trump and his family to stay in the Paris Accord.
Just had email from @NRDC to send to @POTUS fully support your work NRDC, #CleanEnergy is the future #KeepFossilFuelsInTheGround #protect
Only because they were scared the liberals would come and attack them and steal their profits. Now they don't have to be afraid.

Lol this shit ain't about the environment, it's about control.
Global business leaders support the #ParisAgreement bc they know it is good for the planet and economy.
Could you explain to Donald Trump what this is really about? Would be great :)
just because some believe that human industry didnt have anything to do with current cO2, doesnt mean that we cant fix it! #ParisAgreement
I sure hope they do maybe they should put their money together.
Global business leaders support the Paris Agreement because climate change is a fucking business opportunity for them.
It's not the time to close the eyes
