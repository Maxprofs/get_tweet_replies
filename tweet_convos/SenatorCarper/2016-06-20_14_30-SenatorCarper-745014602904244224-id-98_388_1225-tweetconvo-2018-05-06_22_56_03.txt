just a reminder,  this is a Constitutional Republic, not a Democracy.  How about you start respecting the Constitution.
Republic IS a Democracy, the only pure Republic is a direct democracy  @usmc0311pi @ChrisMurphyCT @Kemper525 @PalimpsestMan @FaithNGuns
constitution is the law of the land.  Shall not be infringed! #2A
well while I believe in the 2nd, the people made it they can take it away @usmc0311pi @ChrisMurphyCT @Kemper525 @PalimpsestMan @FaithNGuns
idiot
@usmc0311pi @ChrisMurphyCT @Kemper525 @PalimpsestMan @FaithNGuns
Context matters.  He was speaking against those who rejected self-government.
right and those who say majority run govs are tyrannical @PalimpsestMan @usmc0311pi @ChrisMurphyCT @Kemper525 @FaithNGuns
Taking advantage of tragedy.Where were you after Charleston or when 68 were killed in Chicago? Opportunist BS
let's deny sn American due process and deny them their 2A right. And out of fear?  Your a disgrace to our founding fathers
make us violate our constitutional rights oyt of fear of them?
and yes, I am watching you all on @cspan Thank you from Michigan @SenStabenow @SenGaryPeters
fuck both of those bozos
please don't give up
I dont cower to terrorism,  and I sure as hell dont forfeit my constitutional  right to it!
you're a shameful American.
#Enough #DisarmHate Thank you Sen Murphy!
thank you senator. We are all on your side.
.@ChrisMurphyCT Tuesday's NYDN says it all
NONE OF THESE LAWS ON THE BILL WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE ATTACK. TERRORIST DONT CARE AB THE LAW! THIS IS A SHAME TO AMERICANS.
Yes it would have! Even if it stops 1, what if your kid was in that school that could have been prevented?
has the war on drugs stopped drug use? I encourage you to read the bill and look at the criteria FBI uses.
I'm looking at the clock & asking myself, how long will the Sargent at Arms continue to ignore the House being disrupted ??!
you the man!!
Deserves another play today... Getting hard to turn on television/computer/phone- one must just stay away from reality now
Thank you Sen Murphy!!! You are a voice of reason. I'm praying for a miracle
you helped conduct the sandy hook hoax right? Your house was Staging area?
delusional
if you have proof please share
first off, you need to learn about guns to understand what we already know. Guns r not at fault, just as a car doesn't crash!
DEFEATED, and your still full of BULLSHIT
Thank you for trying so hard&standing up for us when we can't stand up for ourselves.My heart hurts. God Bless you 
thank u for your hard work too bad the other senators don't have a conscience.
thank you
Thank you for getting this to a vote. I know you'll keep fighting til sensible measures are passed.
why are they Voting no are they scared of the @NRA
I can't believe the amendment didn't pass ! my heart breaks :(
Thank You @ChrisMurphyCT . We can not give up because there is just too much at stake!
you fail again, guns are not the problem, politicians like you are!  Better start polishing your resume!!
Thank you for all you do. We will all look back w gratitude for your efforts because you are on the right side of history.
.@ChrisMurphyCT I hope your legs and voice are rested up
keep fighting the good fight sir- and thank you
try again later
don't give up!!!'
The shooter wasn't on a terrorist watch list. Obama forbid the FBI to do a thorough investigation. Debate that.
so sorry it didn't pass. Please say that people can take it to the polls. Washington state has done it, others can too.
you failed! The constitution and out nation's foundation has won! Our #RightToBear arms is here to stay!
@francie57 @CNN how did ol Bernie vote? Was he there?
Still with you 110%. Please keep fighting for safety.
I can't believe these republican senators are #Enough !!!
you deserved better. This is shameful
you did your best. TY
Really sad 8 dates after Orlando, Republicans care more about their seats and NRA checks than human lives...
Thankyou!
@mssnowwhitty Good idea...watching I mean.
#DisarmHate We r with u!!
Thank you thank you thank you!!
Senator how would taking the guns away prevented the Orlando shooting? Omar was given guns w/background check! Do u own a gun
thank you!
you filibustering? should I bring you some snacks? You know, like those Oregon militia guys needed snacks?
@TexDem16 thank you SENATOR  Murphy.
@SenatorCarper Will these measures even come up for a vote in the House? I know the @NRA owns more Republicans there.
They won't pass the Senate so that's moot.
Why does @RealDonaldTrump need to discuss gun laws with @NRA? Why does the NRA dictate US laws? How is that democracy?
NRA is comprised of voters who can vote elected officials out of office.
I am watching live  When is your amendment up for vote?
@ChrisMurphyCT
watching......@SenateMajLdr and @RandPaul - Do your job to protect the health of the American people. We have had #Enough
and I'm on Twitter urging them to vote no.
We're here! THANK YOU!!!
#ENOUGH

@nhdogmom
Gun contrl is a Problem.This isn't rocket science.The NRA should be made 2 see hw they kill people and see blood in dir hands
Thank you!
Thank you 
The US military budget in 2015 was $601 billion. It is more than the fisical budgets of all the countries in Africa. Yet...
Thank you. We're watching how everyone votes
Watching. Thank you!
Thank You!
Some comments seem to suggest periodic #gunviolence is the price we pay for the freedom to own whatever firearm we want.
Thank you! #Enough
stay strong Senator, you are in the right and history will remember you as a voice of reason in a sea of chaos and madness
good job. Thanks.
Thank you so much!
So much #Respect and #Gratitude
Get em Chris!
WE STAND WITH YOU! #ENOUGH!
We love being vilified for exercising our Constitutional rights. We won't forget.
Yes the govt Should be Required to go to court before they can deny my Rights under the 2nd Amendment! Due Process ! #2A
As you speak more shootings continue to go on.  #actnow
.@ChrisMurphyCT I was underwhelmed by your lecture.
but OK to send Billions in arms to SA and Israel.
bravo!!! Well done sir
Thank you.
Thank you.
. Go get them Tiger!!!
Can't wait...but prayers are with you! #Enough
When #tyranny rings your door bell it will be speaking on the #Senate floor wearing a suit/tie. Another BeneDICK Arnold
i'm not one of your constituents, but i want to thank you for standing up for this very important subject!
not going to happen. People actually care about the constitution.
@ChrisMurphyCT
Even if a universal background check was instituted, what would stop people from ignoring the requirement?
