@BarackObama How many billions in taxpayer dollars did you waste on Solyndra ???
@Woman_here @BarackObama Where is Solyndra today  Plus all the other company's that were funded and failed or bought in bankruptcy by China?
@Woman_here @BarackObama and peoples lives.... Yep @Obama destroyning the America people !
@Woman_here @BarackObama There are no new jobs in the regions where the coal industry has been decimated. So clueless !
@BarackObama Solar will no doubt continue to increase its market share but it is not "critical." Nuclear, OTOH certainly will be.
@luisbaram @BarackObama solar & wind is critical to national security...we need to ensure clean air & water to make americans safe
@souzi54 @BarackObama Nuclear produces almost 80% of the electricity in France. Why not in the USA? #VeryLowCarbon
@luisbaram @BarackObama fukishima...radiation pollution  solar & wind is the way to go clean and renewable
@souzi54 Today the US is the leader in nuclear production but China is catching up fast. IEA 2014 report.
@luisbaram we dont need nuclear when solar & wind are available
@souzi54 Right. But solar and wind are not always available.
@BarackObama When will Solar be on same ground as Oil/Nat Gas?
@JrMoschitta @BarackObama Toyota was careful to introduce the Prius
over a ten year window, to better absorb those higher start up costs
@BarackObama @barraford Pipe dream. Solar = childish nonsense. Peeps have no idea about scale.
@econundertow @BarackObama Solar energy is such a childish dream that Germany is very successfully using. Costs down 80% in 5 years.
@EnergiewendeGER @barraford @econundertow @BarackObama & price to consumer #pv ? & CO2 emissions also up unlike USA which has seem both fall
@JefEnergy @EnergiewendeGER @barraford @BarackObama 1st step to solving the energy/pollution problem = GET RID OF THE DAMNED CARS.
@econundertow @EnergiewendeGER @barraford @BarackObama Step 1 is getting public support, banning #cars not going 2 help that...
@JefEnergy @EnergiewendeGER @barraford @BarackObama Sorry dude, when your house is on fire you don't want support you want water spraying
@econundertow @EnergiewendeGER @barraford @BarackObama True, but u will need someone 2 pump the water... #teamwork #publicsupport

@BarackObama Unless you want to pave over the entire country with solar panels.  Not a very green solution.
@BarackObama While solar is a part of a diverse energy supply, it cannot meet the needs of an industrial society.
@BarackObama No.  This country needs to invest in new base load nuclear generating capacity.
. @BarackObama @greentechmedia I tried to retweet this twice but I guess you can't do that.
@BarackObama Maybe solar can be replaced with your lying boastful hot air!
@BarackObama @emilykrantz not yet, we already had a 250 million tax dollars investment in one solar company and they went bankrupt fast
@Butterflysayz probably bc people aren't buying solar enough.. Regardless it is the key to the future at least one day
@emilykrantz because it's not cost effective. It's so inefficient. Give it 10 years instead of putting it right on the market
