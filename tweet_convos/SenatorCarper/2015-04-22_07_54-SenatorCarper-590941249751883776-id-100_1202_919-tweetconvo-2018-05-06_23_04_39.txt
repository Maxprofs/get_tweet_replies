@WhiteHouse @TheLouMo
@WhiteHouse @HHSGov just a suggestion, but maybe a good first step would be preventing #Iran from getting nuclear bomb. #NoNuclearIran EVER!
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Best think to do is get rid of Obama. All he does is make thing worst

@WhiteHouse Fight with "whom"? All that we need is to reduce exploitation and be more sensible, whether it is our planet, or human beings!
@WhiteHouse ...Practice what you preach. It's #EarthDay, not APRIL Fool's Day.
@WhiteHouse Keeping the environment clean is great, but the #propganda you vomit about man made "climate change" is about #power & #money
@WhiteHouse And in parallel work to make that statement invalid by expanding our frontier to other planets.
@WhiteHouse You first: don't fly to Florida for a simple photo op. #ActOnClimate #EarthDay #Hypocrites
@WhiteHouse So plant a tree and use AF1 a little less.
