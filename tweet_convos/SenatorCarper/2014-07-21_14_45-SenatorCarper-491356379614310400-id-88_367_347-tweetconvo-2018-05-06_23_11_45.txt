#LBGT / #WorkplaceEquality will be but a minor footnote in history vs. @BarackObama's lack of leadership & failed presidency. @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse Hardly; this is a man dedicated to opposing God....
@WhiteHouse nosso parabéns aos EUA.
@WhiteHouse Mr.President people who where born LGBT are not at fault, Their gender has nothing to do with their work or their career.Thnk U

@WhiteHouse You will answer to God for your embrace of all that is immoral.

@WhiteHouse I dream of being an American.
@WhiteHouse were you on the "right side of history" when you and Holder sold guns to the Mexican drug cartels?

@WhiteHouse ley de asilo infantil aprobada en 2008 durante la presidencia de George W. Bush. http://goo.gl/EqYtvV 
@WhiteHouse Isn't the US law on discrimination protecting everyone?  How many more groups need to be singled out?
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse You are on the wrong side of His-Story
@WhiteHouse I could agree wholeheartedly except it comes down as another royal decree. Didn't the Supreme Court just say "enough?"
@WhiteHouse: Ur ALWAYS on the 'right side of history', Barry - all while you've thrown America under the bus!
@WhiteHouse Another silly photo opp that means absolutely nothing supported by 
followers, not leaders.   This is just nonsense.
@WhiteHouse good work Mr President on LGBT discrimination, now for leadership in Gaza and Ukraine and stopping discriminate abuses of power

@WhiteHouse  We have world wide crisis' and this moron is worried about work place equality. How about doing your f 'ing job ass bite?
@WhiteHouse you couldn't find the right side of history with GPS and your entire Cabinet.
@WhiteHouse #LGBT members of Students for Justice in Palestine demand share principles of inclusion abroad. Demand equality for #Palestine
@WhiteHouse @laurakfillault You are a disgrace. Resign.
While #Palestinian kids die: "@WhiteHouse: "We're on the right side of history." —Obama on expanding #WorkplaceEquality for LGBT workers.
@WhiteHouse That is we need! More Laws!  Yes Please!
@WhiteHouse It was already done!! Discrimination in the workplace has been illegal for years!!This is just campaign slogan material
@WhiteHouse  Why Obama does not speak for gaza. Condoning the deaths of children in Gaza.

@Swing4daFences @WhiteHouse I'm sure they're amply mad at Bush for his illegal invasion of their country.
@FoxFireInferno @WhiteHouse a Illegal? Sadam was guilty of war crimes, killing his own people. Clinton stood by and watched Rwanda genocide.
