we have a special counsel.. his name is Jeff Sessions.. let him do his job and you might do as well..
yet, thats what you just suggested for Flynn & this investigation. The irony is deafening
please understand.. my point to Jeff Merkley is his failure to the people who elected him.
fair enough, how has Merkley failed the people who elected him?
rural Oregon is and has been suffering since 2008.. Curry County is the most economically
depressed in the State.. I doubt if Merkley has been south of Eugene in the last 8 years
2 unless you want to learn to speak Russian he absolutely must hold trump accountable
I do agree that our relationship with Russia needs to be addressed.. but..
no.. what I miss is a Sen that is concerned with the state that he represents.. meanwhile Oregon runs amok..
thank you, do NOT stop pushing for this.
We need to focus on jobs, KFalls is an economic disaster! Do you where Klamath Falls is? It's in OR!
just go ahead and add Sessions to the people being investigated...
Nope, we need to work on the Clinton Foundation and putting Hillary in jail.
@MoveOn @TheJusticeDept @POTUS @PressSec #Specialcounsel #SpecialCounsel #SpecialCounsel. This is not going away
.@SenJeffMerkley @TheJusticeDept Where were you during the #Clinton Hearings? Maybe the IRS Hearing? Okay, how about the #Benghazi Hearing?
, I was right there when the House investigated Hillary. Where were you?
You lost the Election because you stop caring about the plain Joe & Janes without special interests!
, Actually, the saying of Lincoln how some of the people can be fooled all the time is reason.
@pamvictor @TheJusticeDept. I agree, the Justice Department is too biased to investigate. It mus be an independent source
@MoveOn @TheJusticeDept @DevinNunes basically saying complete opposite as all others regarding #Trumprussia
with news about Sessions, the question becomes who in Trumps campaign was NOT talking to Russia?

yes, please do an independent investigation
Do it!!!! #russiagate #FlynnResignation #TheResistance
Sen Merkley, THANK YOU for fighting the good fight. We need more senators and reps like you. IMPEACH TRUMP!
Agree 100%.
grounds for pushing Logan Act voilation are shaky at best.
Flynn was just exercising due diligence with a foreign official as a new incoming admin.
The only thing Dems and Rep have in common is they want to waste money on investigations that do mean much!
thank you senator 
#Russia no problem in US elections. Israel is http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/03/22/the-best-congress-aipac-can-buy/ … Wars r 4 http://www.globalresearch.ca/greater-israel-the-zionist-plan-for-the-middle-east/5324815 …
I can spread petition 4 Sessions recusal if u tweet it. Move On email petition hard to share.
When did you ask for special counsel for Bhengazi? US soldiers died and you were silent. Conscience?
Sorry Jeff, Rooshans didn’t write Podesta Emails
Let's look HERE

@TheJusticeDept
I love you, Jeff, 5 endorsement of Bernie but I will not be joining the anti-Russia hysteria & new cold war
Is this really your petition? Wanted to make sure.
yes. Spent $Ms investigating oral sex in the White House. Can at least see what Russia's involvement is.
Can we do a 2-fer? Look into Flynn & Hillary at the same time?
yes, it appears laws were broken, by the NSA or CIA.
@ORDems @TheJusticeDept Senator, reach out to Senator McCain and others with Trump concerns. Form a bipartisan front.
maybe same people can investigate this that investigated Hillary wait then no matter what they would get off
Are you serious?where does it say who leaked this information which is a felony BIPARTISAN PIGS #WeThePeople
You are a complete Embarrassment to the state I love. Resign NOW!
.@SenJeffMerkley @TheJusticeDept Thank you, Senator Merkley, for your continued efforts. I appreciate you! #Thatsmysenator
YES WE DO!
There's no there there.Get to work on the people's business instead of the childish kicking/screaming; ULOST
no we don't propaganda fabricated by sore loser @HillaryClinton supports and complicit media- Deal with it!
Fifth straight week of increases in OIL RIGS!
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
Joker Jeff Lies again!
Good. Flyn didn't break the law, but leakers did. They should be in prison.
Thank you for protecting the American people. You are an inspiration.
No! Obviously, Someone on the Soros Communist Democratic Party leaked info. Yes, Americans are laughing. 
And Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from all dealings to do with this matter do to conflict of interest!
thank you for looking into this
I'm watching you on cspan now, thank you for standing up for our world ! 
@SenSchumer @repjohnlewis @MaxineWaters HALT ALL BUSINESS until INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OPENED!@TheJusticeDept
& we need to oust Senators who are promoting OhBummer's 'Organization for Action' paying for rioters/anarchy
We need to go after Senators like yourself and others who are not jailing traitors leaking classified info!!
This needs to be done sooner than later.
Seeing as you are all the people hired to DEFEND the Constitution.. DO SOMETHING, GO LOW! SAVE US
Thank you, Senator. Much and support from rural Eastern Oregon!
Hateful people in eastern Oregon? Guess so
PLS With Trump, Flynn, Manafort, Paige, Bannon & Tillison pro Russia we need 2B sure big treason wasnt done
Congress should strip some power from spy agencies to keep them from spying on citizens. This smells like the IRS scandal
Uh, I think there's bigger fish to fry: like the torture & mass murder of Americans via military weapons...
Trump has done nothing wrong, I think you democrats are really getting off on the wrong foot.  lol sad.
teamsters  matty  maroun

Full intelligence audit of all 16 agencies.
READ THE FINANCIAL TIMES ARTICLE!!! @MaxineWaters @mmfa @maddow @MaddowBlog
@annequast @TheJusticeDept Finally! Yes a special-independent counsel.
Thank U.
does any1 really believe that #flynn acted alone? No way does he make a call for @POTUS45__ without approval
Blocking independent investigation can't be called anything other than Communist sympathizing
Senator as long as AG Sessions is in power he won't allow it.  Us Moderates are disappointed right now.
@SenatorCarper @TheJusticeDept everyone knows laws were broken,stop trying to to fix it before you can solve it
GOP opposing any and all gals for investigation. We Demand a full inquiry.
@SenatorCarper @TheJusticeDept regardless if law is from 1700's it was broken. Maybe never prosecuted cuz this is 1st time?
@SenDuckworth support this

@SenJeffMerkley @SenatorCarper @TheJusticeDept
@SenatorCarper @TheJusticeDept #WeDemandAnswers #ImpeachTrump #russiagate
but not for the Hillary Clinton email scandal, the Iran deal or anything else under democratic leadership? 
Thank you senator Merkley for fighting for truth and justice for all. So proud to be your fellow Oregonian!⚘
also need to determine leakers of Nat Sec info to press & prosecute them. Go back & do Obama & Iran as well.
while your at it let's look into the whole Russians hacking into HRC's private and illegal server.
Agreed! Thank you for your leadership Senator Merkley.
Involved in what? You need to stop with the hyperbole..you infer based on nothing then accuse about nothing
Yes we do. Fully independent and open, unlike the current kompromised administration. @SenJeffMerkley @TheJusticeDept
the entire @realDonaldTrump should be investigated
Yes! Ideally a special prosecutor and bipartisan investigation, Dem leader. This is a complex conspiracy.
You fall off your rocking horse at an early age? Where were you when a need for investigating Hillary and emails wasneeded?
like the one for Benghazi? Where was the Pres and Sec when we were under attack!
I called your office about this very request. Thanks. Anyone potentially involved should be investigated
I'd focus on the 14mil peeps that left @TheDemocrats because they left to watch you burn not Trump. #Wakeup
...you're crazy....sheesh
Who illegally tapped the phone and who intentionally leaked the conversation?
Ohh, make it Yates! We know she is on the side of the country.
So full of hate you people are... Sad
@SarahPinsker @TheJusticeDept @SenatorLeahy Yes we do! Thank you.
yes investigate who leaked the private phone conversation that was the real crime
Who illegally wiretapped his phone?
Thanks @SenJeffMerkley @TheJusticeDept US citizens and our democracy deserve and demand an #IndependentInvestigation
Coming from someone who promotes women to wear a hijab.  What do you know of US Democracy.
Good luck - the GOP have become the party "Whatever we want to do we will and we'll just change the rules".
I want to know who are the leakers?
ha ha ha. For about 3 seconds I thought this tweet came from Jeff Sessions.
What can you do to make this happen?
thank you! @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand please support this.
Agreed! This certainly goes beyond Flynn foolish and naive to think otherwise. This is dangerous for the US!
A Special Counsel, did Obama send Classified Doc to Hillary via email? Nobody above law #StupidOnPurpose
yes! Thank you Senator Merkley!
what is Wyden doing? Where is his name?
yea let's have special counsel on the laws you and the DNC break daily. You should are trader Merkley
first for Hillary then for Flynn nobody is above the law. #StupidOnPurpose
Unfortunately, the corrupt @GOP doesn't want to investigate, so Sessions will probably ignore letter.
#IfIWasYou @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOPoversight I would start investigating & separate yourselves from @POTUS
Is Jeff Sessions capable of objectivity? Ties to Flynn &Manafort allow for doubt. We independent counsel
@ORDems @TheJusticeDept Of course we do Jeff. But we aren't going to get that. Not soon anyway. Why is the FBI so silent?
So full of Hatred. Sad
while I appreciate everything you do, you really need to get rid of that Snapchat graphic on your profile. This is Twitter.
Thank you Senator. Would you please add strong oversight of the WH to that please?
I am an American citizen and we need an investigation. DT is undermining AMERICA. Do what you are sworn todo
You're actually a fake account. Soros? 
Keep up the fight. Silence is acquiesce.
exactly, like who liked the information so that they can be terminated
please help us Jeff
if the RussiaPublicans are innocent of wrong doing,  they would want the investigation as well.
heres the problen Tom.  Theres still no evidence Russia hacked anything.  Jeff lies again.
I don't want Sessions anywhere near this.. he'll try to drop the whole thing.  I don't trust him at all...
