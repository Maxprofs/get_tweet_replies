Dem lawmakers introduce bill that would force the release of Mar-a-Lago visitor logs http://hill.cm/AHmcNOD  
while FBI investigation in foreign involvement. All children, business ties and private mtgs in club should be monitored
That's what my tax dollars are paying for? A bill for that? How about serving the people? You should bring Obama's list too.
shouldn't we include senators in this act as well? #WeThePeople need to know who is in your living room as well @seanhannity
The business of the Senate is NOT to propose leg. that (a) has zero chance of passing and (b) is therefore a waste of time.
And when we say "the people" it means ALL people not just the rich @SenatorCarper @JulieCook77 @POTUS wants an oligarchy
Trump is not trustworthy without transparency! Hold his feet to the fire! #TrumpLies #MaraLagoAct
@sherrythrasher We should also be allowed tours and access if it is the Winter "White House." WH is the house of the people
We the people have a right to know what happens at White House he calls it the Southern White House so be it
I Agree, but transparency should be equal across all government offices! Wouldn't you agree "Senator?"
Trump's Business Is, Monkey Business, illegal fundraisers,for Political Favor.The Government should Impound.
you just had this epiphany now?? You people are ridiculous
@LeslieMarshall is it the business of the people who stayed at Mar-a-Largo before he was President?
Would this help to REALLY drain swamp, Senator?
stop it senator Carper. Do your job. Work with POTUS to help Americans. This is petty bs.
purty neat! =huh the hill! those DEMs are thinkin'! BEWARE!!! SWAMP MONSTERs EXIST
you didnt care when obama was in office. Your desperations showing

TOM - did you request this from Obama or Bush ? We know the answer ... Tom I would like to see who you've met with ? Please post
And who in the hell are you by the way? Another no-named senator trying to make a name for himself??
As Is Everything 
u Do @SenatorCarper @thehill In Fact We Need A #Law To Cause Reps 2Wear RecordableDevices With #TextVote Apps 4OurRts
The weak little Democrats are pathetic. 
Lets have a bill that reveals al those visiting Obama.
well its supposed to be but under this sorry excuse for a POTUS its not he ignores the fact that he works for the people
@PrincessBravato SO VERY TRUE #RICO ACT NOW!!
I've been saying that Russians probably are the main guests there!
America is a democracy.  Apparently Trump is unsure of what that means.
Good luck getting that passed 
@Michael78372976 Of course it is.  The world feels so sorry for you.
not very smart. Why don't we just know all the confidential phone calls, emails, etc as well? Oh wait, the dems already do
should have been requested from the 1st minute after election on
shouldn't we include senators in this act as well? #WeThePeople need to know who is in your living room as well @seanhannity
This all sounds a bit "If the President does it, it isn't illegal".
@LeslieMarshall unless he keeps that list on a private server in his basement bathroom, right @HillaryClinton ? #fakenews

This is a good thing.
I concur. Make America great by holding Trump accountable.
OH. Starting now?? How about the ladt 8 years of shadiness?
he should have realized that before he took the office !
were you one of the people in md that was cheering when the immigrants raped that 14 yr old girl you are deployabl
@POTUS @XNSNews 
@SenatorCarper YES  BUT HIS FAMILY IS NOT.  SORRY IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO VIOLATE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF THE TRUMP FAMILY!
unlike any Pres. before him, unlike any Con. or Sen. ppl want 24/7/365 from DJT
AS TRUMP SAYS , MARALAGO IS THE SUMMER WH

@thehill We should know all visitors, members & staff names. It would help if you emphasized safety of POTUS/team at MAL.
Yes but the problem with THIS POTUS- who lies as easily as he takes in oxygen - would b how to enforce this requirement!
let's extent this to Senators too.
Senator, how about a #travelban on DJT travel to #Trump properties consistent w ethics rules for Fed employees?

#MAGA #Resist @CherylShuman
good idea!
AS TRUMP SAYS  MARALAGO IS THE SUMMER WHITEHOUSE
sure wish you would have had same attitude with obama. That administration cost us all dearly.
Damn right it is!!!
@happydarby Why wasn't this true when the Democrats were embroiled in secrets up to their armpits the last 8 years?
because they didn't hold national security meetings in public? Either way it's good for all sides.
then why not make it an amendment so it applies to ALL presidents - not just Republicans?
you guys are wasting time on this bill while we have a shit health care program. Fix healthcare #obamacare SUCK
.@SenatorCarper did we always know who visited Pres.Nixon in San Clemente, and Pres.Bush in Crawford? What's the big deal?
agree trump works for us even while he lies and fails at everything he does. He isn't a private business man now.

@kkhooray can you remind Trump of that please.
I wish Congress and the Senate did the business of the people.  Yall like a bunch of unruly kids!
They just did. The people did not want the AHCA. They called, emailed, tweeted.
yea I think a guy needs a break every now and the why don't you dems get off your ass do something about you exploding HC
Andddd #bBama Spying on Trump is the BUSINESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE #DEMSARECORRUPT
For a split-second I thought "Dem lawmakers" was AAVE ...
so are his russian ties - not nunes - committee should call for them and go on w/o chairman. If guy was sick they don't meet
thank you!
@JafJeffrey   Yessir!  What do you think honesty means?  Sure Trump is a human, but that means fallible!
as soon as all you politicians disclose all your back room meetings and under the table deals. #termlimits #draintheswamp
The business of our US Senators is also the business of the CITIZENS of the US. Are you included in this bill Senator Carper?
Beautiful
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump  WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE WHO VISITS @SenatorCarper   HOME, BUSINESS OF SENATE IS BUSINESS OF THE PEOPLE
Yep. True for all. See how that works.
@thehill 
 thank you, Sir
Really?  Where was this disclosure fervor when Obama held secret meetings with Billionaires and Pharmaceutical CEOS?
@WomenG4Hillary That would be an interesting log of characters now wouldn't it?
ask the "Inquirer" or "Star" they always had the scoop on Trump.  You guys are joke!
They are his favorite papers. Always have been. He believes the contents.
Here in NY he's always been their darling.
when he's president... not beforehand...
Also, it's called the MAR-A-LAGO bill, which is a brilliant acronym
@SenWhitehouse congrats in better marketing, to whoever managed acronym MARALAGO
Thank you!!
@thehill those records are public property.  Transparency!!!  What are you hiding??
heck yes the people need to know who he meets with.
@CecilyKeating @thehill We need to know who is 'paying to play' with the trump.
Let's make DT transparent.
Maybe his business can pay for the Secret Service forced to go along when its execs travel.
Not only are our taxed payer dollars wasted on his for profit business, but it's an unfair advantage of free security.
He pays all but security. Obama paid for nothing on his lavish vacations.
