Then why has trump refused to implement sanctions on the Russians that were overwhelmingly passed by both houses and signed into law by trump himself and then never implemented in almost a year Treasonous trump and putin puppets
I think u better check that. He laid sanctions on Russian oligarchs and Russian companies just the beginning of this month....ALL were tied to Putin or the Kremlin somehow. Where u get your info? Gotta stay away from there
Did that hurt
@realDonaldTrump has done nothing but talk,all the while faking to be tough behind the polices put in place under Obama administration. Trump is only trying to give appearance he`s doing something.
Marie Harf is an anti-Trump strawdog, & Mike Wallace is little better, when discussing the @Potus gettin Nobel Peace Prize for NK denuking! Yes, he deserves it, and his predecessor Barrack Obama needs to attend ceremony!
@ChrisCoons the President doesn't need your approval or praise for doing what no other President could do. Good try though.
@ChrisCoons reluctantly admits to Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday that Trump "HELPED" create opening. If by "helped" he means strategized, architected, coordinated, served as liaison to other countries about & spokesman for it, then YUP, I guess @realDonaldTrump "helped".
@FoxNews
This is what happens when the leader in charge knows how to play tough and have the guts to convince the enemy. Unlike previous Leader who is Weak and will settle for appeasement by bribing the enemy just to stop making bombs.
Sanctions have been applied to NoKo for years. This is nothing new.
Gosh, I missed that. Did he say it with a straight face? 
Doubtful
A MOUNTAIN COLLAPSED! NoKo nuclear testing site was buried! They are “making nice” now because they’ve got no choice! 

Unless Trump caused that to happen (spoiler: he didn’t), he doesn’t get any credit for this.
POTUS has done nothing but made North and South realize they are stronger together.  They hate him too!
I can't see where the sanctions he implemented have even had time to have that big of effect on NK.  He has been told if he makes more nukes and tries to launch them he will have a ecological disaster on his hands
It's all pretend. End the Kim regime!
How about face to face being done

North and South Korea ending the Korean War and agreeing to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula has everything to do with Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un and nothing to do with Trump. He didn’t facilitate anything but wants to take all the credit for other people’s work.
Hypocrite, admit you were wrong, you also said to Chris that Iran is a dangerous regime but you voted to give them a nuke, your just another hack that’s in it for the money not the country #VoteRed2018
Not bad for 8 years in Congress Mr Coons
Coons admits Bathhouse Barrys failure of north koria while trying to claim this diplomatic success by the president was nothing new, jewish chris wallick remained silent
