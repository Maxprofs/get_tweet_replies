Goal should be to unite Korea under the South government, free and feed the people of North Korea, as John Bolton said. May have to payoff Kim Jung Un to live in Beijing.
John Bolton is the ideal adviser to the president no one I mean no one can take away his value to the United States of America
Isn't it just wonderful that we have this "person" in the admin.  Makes me feel so much more secure knowing he is advising Trump.  God help us.
Nice follow up question about the Iraq war, oh wait...
Maybe you give him a lesson on geography. He referred yo the Korean Pininsula in his speech as "the Korean Peninsula of North Korea".  He might also want to remind Trump that North and South Korea already declared an end to the Korean war last week!
You expect the mainstream media to understand
Then Bolton can never be trusted to give sound advice to Trump,his mind is made up towards North Korea.
