Tester is paying Perkins Coie almost monthly. What’s up?
#ResignTester
Propaganda machine rolling early this morning with more BS. 
How about a special counsel to look into why the @GOP has been bending over backwards to protect a pathological president?
Snowflake! #ButHerEmail! #Benghazi #Covfefe
@realDonaldTrump

LOL
LOL! Where has this moron been for the past 350 days?
Looking for his Relevance.
Everything is starting to be exposed/disclosed of the corruption the last admin was involved in including a”political coup”against the President!The facts and truth are starting to be”revealed”!Why is Special Council”still around?It’s part of the”Coup”!WOW!!
You don’t need a special council a 2 year old can see they are corrupt we need Sessions to do his job
Looks like Lindsey is back to wearing his MAGA Trump loving knee pads again...
I know a SC Senator that just qualified for a few free rounds of golf at Mar A Lago!
@realDonaldTrump
#UnsealTheDeals Using taxpayer money to pay victims of sexual harassment/assault by government employees is corrupt!!!

@mattgaetz @DevinNunes @mark
@realDonaldTrump
What are you waiting for, Senator?
We should had more special council like Mueller to investigate Trump's incompetent to lead our country.

Lindsey Graham...the Kanye West of Congress!!!
No we should have them looking at you and your buddies who won’t even investigate treason.  Why.  Wat are you getting from that. Besides $$$
What did you do to those underage male prostitutes @LindseyGrahamSC ? You are terrified the kompromat Trump has on you will come out, and it should.
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
Why do you always say that you should have done something. Do it!
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump
You’re right, Lindsey.   When the indictments come for Trump or Trump Campaign officials, we will want to have completely delegitimized the FBI so the proper amount of anarchy ensues.  Way to lead the country, LG.
I rarely agree with #Graham, but he's right on this point. Then again he's agreed with a lot of @realDonaldTrump policies which makes him two-faced. @burberryant @PattiKimble @ShellyRKirchoff @LadyBleach @_AndiLynne @Sedona_333 @AnnaFlowersPI @Maxeightyeight
They’re all corrupt including graham
Shut up graham , your full of it...
Why can’t the DOJ just do their job???  Are they so corrupt like the FBI, too?
Diversion, diversions. Tell you what, let’s have a dozen special counsels looking into DOJ, FBI, some House members with their investigation report, Pruitt, Cohen, any congressional members getting NRA money, and a number of other people with shady or political inconsistencies.
That is definitely something that shld have happened already. sessions is a great disappointment.
@LindseyGrahamSC Are you trying to blow our Democracy? Now you want to attack the DOJ. Why don't you just go burn some flags.
He says one tbing in front of the camera and another when hes not
Looking for the clip of your conversation this morning with James Kallstrom ?
Somebody should, America’s DOJ is extremely weak.
I agree plenty there
Lindsey Graham makes my head spin. He blows whichever way the wind blows.
DOJ corruption
AND FBI CORRUPTION
AND IRS CORRUPTION
AND FCC CORRUPTION
AND VA CORRUPTION
AND EPA CORRUPTION
Oh, and don't forget ET AL corruption
we should have a special looking at "lil pecker head" dumb butt "wezzie gwaham"
Anti-American much?
Agree and also the white house relation with Russia
I’d like to see a special counsel investigate the rubles that went into your campaign.
Come on Lindsey you’re not stupid and you know darn well that Trump is the one that is corrupt.  Why don’t you GOP’ s grow some spine and admit the truth and quit putting America at risk.
Laughable
We should have a special council look into these crooked republicans
The question remains....what kompromat does Russia have on Graham?
Yes we should but that will never happen
Let's get one SC done with, first. The American people cannot handle two SC investigations at once. There is so much hate, discontent, intrigue and posturing daily already, please, no more! When Mueller's done, then, maybe... @jeffsessions
...OH LOOKIE HERE...LG BECOMING NUNES FLUNKY. YOU PEOPLE NEED HELP...DONT WORRY, 2018 IS ON ITS WAY. BY
We know it stinks but when is something going to be done! This is ridiculous! So much crime & collusion with this group & nothing gets done!
Remember when Lindsay hated Trump? Well I’ll tell you one thing, when he falls for a man...WOW 
Shame on Lindsey who became a "convert" to Trump's lies, deflections, denials, distractions, etc. Those "golf games" with a lot of mulligans hailing the "President" to advance his own promotion into cabinet?
In 1996 Congress enacted a clarifying amendment to 18 U.S.C. § 1515, which defines the term "corruptly" as used in section 1505 to mean "acting with an IMPROPER PURPOSE, PERSONALLY OR BY INFLUENCING ANOTHER.”
18 US Code 1505
Whoever CORRUPTLY influences, obstructs, or impedes the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the US > not more than 5 years.
Journalists & the vast majority of society know you, @seanhannity & @TuckerCarlson have made $millions mocking the intelligence of undereducated white Americans by cynically and self-servingly convincing them they are at risk they of being marginalized by the sands of time.
Hey graham YOU and your buddies could impeach these activists judges too. U in the swamp too me thinks
And why haven’t we already????

Tinfoil hat time.
@LindseyGraham
You, Sir or Madam, which ever the case may be, Should realize that your Grandstanding has become Old and Tiresome.
You are Irrelevant and should look for Employment Elsewhere.
Congress SHOULD TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE against Clapper who lied about the dossier
That’s exactly right
Trump let you know he’s got something on you during that fun golf spree, didn’t he @LindseyGrahamSC ?
#eyeroll 2x
Poor Maria, there was a time when you might have been called a responsible journalist. You've dropped so low it's staggering.
Trump puppet
2nd Spec Counsel is needed Today! SESSIONS is the INSURANCE POLICY & MUST GO!
We should have a special counsel looking in Trump's administration, all of his elected Dept's heads are looting our tax $ because the Republican control congress refusses to do their job of oversight.
#VoteThemOut
No, we just need to clean house!  Stop wasting the country’s money and Congress’s time!!  DO YOUR JOB!!
Remember when Republicans would never stand for anyone bad mouthing law enforcement?
Maria, you're right on point today! Great investigation of the real facts! You are the best!
So we need to investigate Sessions?
@RepRohrabacher @DevinNunes @RepDevinNunes @Graham @LindseyGrahamSC could form a   cult...
Amazing!  How many committees are there in the House and the Senate and you guys can't get anything done without going for outside help.  Might as well set up just another agency and call it Office of the Special Counsel.  We have DOJ, AG, Committees, IG, and not one indictment.

If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
Amen to that!  Why hasn't that happened yet?
Absolutely correct
They also need to investigate Clapper and Brennan do to all of their threats to the President
This is REALLY CORRUPTION and COLLUSION! It’s between them the media and the left. That’s the COLLUSION! CLAPPER AND BRENNAN are both a SHAME and DISGRACE to our country. As Brennan would say, they are both ‘CHARLATANs’. To bad the insurance policy has been turned around.
How about term limits?
Ummmmm...YOU THINK!!!!!!!!
Can @foxnews Tweet/post the full 2nd segment of that interview.. Please & thank you.
They all R worried about who will win election/ejection -I am worried about the people of USA  
Talk talk talk, where’s the walk?
This guy can't ever hold a consistent bearing. Tacks from left to right so much it's difficult to see core values.
No! we need AG Jeff Sessions to start doing his job with the, already existing, overwhelming evidence &  start  indicting these political hack crooks, not another endless special investigation with a Liberal & Never Trumper RINO panel to find nothing wrong!!!
Then we should have a Special Council look into that Special Council
Well. It appears @LindseyGrahamSC is batting for our side this morning. You never know with him. He's a bit "squishy". And, I'm a SC voter, so....
You get a special council! And You get a special council! EVERYONE GETS A SPECIAL COUNCIL!
What is wrong with Lindsey Graham, how much is he getting paid to talk stupidly, undermining the DOJ like this this is so unAmerican its unbelievable that our own government is making us look so weak. LETS VOTE LINDSEY GRAHAM OUT.
You have to get through Benghazi first. We’re still waiting! 
We should have a special counsel looking at Congress ENABLING and willfully blind to DOJ & intel & Obama-Clinton corruption
Duh  ; ya think  Lindsey Graham ?

Hey Lindsay, “if the shoe were on the other foot” these corrupt Clinton/Obama Pawns...Brennan, Clapper, Comey, McCabe, Page, Strzok, Ohr and others, all would have been prosecuted and put away by now. Some probably would have had coincidental accidents by now too.
Deversion. Wrap it up.
Agreed DOJ
Who is this horribly sounding woman in the white dress with the lip job gone bad?
Why does she always screech ?
I know u can’t be talking about Maria. To speak of her in such a manner; Ur Hate pours
(2) Not drips but actually pours from ur gut.
Yeah that’s we need, another tax payer funded counsel to waste more money. Dave Ramsey is correct about spending money like congress. Duh!!!!
Waiting for you to say “We WILL...”
#FlintStillDoesntHaveCleanWater
Disagreed with Graham on many things but always respected him. Today's comments and his lack of having an actual spine in this administration is one of the saddest transformations I have seen. So sad to see him lose his credibility.
If Mueller had been honest he would have stopped the Trump/Russian investigation day one for lack of evidence.
Hi Maria...I believe DOJ WILL NOT investigate itself. @realDonaldTrump
Maria should have stuck with comments on the stock market and interviews with company executives. Her political opinions are dictated by Murdoch influence and lack any knowledge of real facts. Lindsay is just a Tfump lackey these days, once Trump pretended to like him play golf!
Putin has nambla tapes of Lindsey?  Doesn’t he?
Big surprise. The Swamp critters are defending each other. 
Go Trump #MAGA
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Lindsey has been #TeaBagging the President!
He’s gone Full On #AssLicking 
He’s lost his virginity...again! 
#WTF are you doing Senator?
The DOJ has been doing their job, unlike you

Balless AG Sessions already said he won't hire. Special Prosecutor! How could he say that?
HA!  :)@LindseyGrahamSC is a 'tool' of the left. Check his score on ConservativeReview. He's graded an 'F' who only votes Conservative 30% of the time for 15 years he's been in D.C.  Can FoxNews only get low graded Senators and Congress critters on its show?
Gee, maybe a special counsel looking at NRA/Russian/ republican PAC money? Asking for a friend
not just DOJ.....also intelligence community including McCains role
Too bad we didn't have a compromised attorney General
shut up already... we know that you know that we know that nothing is ever going to become of this.. the peasants are sick and tired of your babble.. just shut up already..
They why don’t you do it ... all you RINO do is talk about doing things... no action
Well quit saying it and do it already.
YES. However this runs so deep, it will never happen. Nor will anyone likely be yeld accountable.

Not even Comey. Theyll all get away with it.
Bull
@MariaBartiromo you are SO RIGHT! The shaming HAS to stop! Thank you for your reaction and speaking out! #WHCD
Duh
Kiam hundo mordas, neniam mordas al ŝanĝo.
