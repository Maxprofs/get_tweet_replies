Your such a good baby
I’m happy for the USA too, #Korea(s), China and global stability and peace.  But I don’t think we can give credit to @realDonaldTrump.  This is what I imagine happened: Rocket Man and Cheeto are insane and Xi decided he needed to force Kim to stand down.  China was in charge.
How about cheering him on now instead of waiting and help him succeed.
Wow!  First time since the election, a Democrat actually would rather the "United States" succeed, even if it also meant the President may too.  Not a zero-sum game.
Democrats do not.
No he won't!! He is just blah, blah , blah!!
Chris - Get your pom poms ready, and start practicing your splits!!!
We all want that shame the democrats don't, or calf wouldn't be in the trouble it is in..
Get ready

Actions speak louder than words.
Moon Jae-in deserves a nomination for the Nobel Peace prize. He has been working hard with NK to stop the escalation between Trump and NK. Trump has bullied and insulted that is not negotiating. Some how Moon has managed to remain a calming voice. Kudos Pres. Moon Jea-in
#PutinsPuppet had nothing -- No thing -- to do with this, so stop feeding his bloated ego by giving him credit. #NorthKorea #TrumpIsAMoron with the #StinkOfTreason

Really ?

North and South Korea ending the Korean War and agreeing to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula has everything to do with Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un and nothing to do with Trump. He didn’t facilitate anything but wants to take all the credit for other people’s work.

Riiight.
But I am not a bot.........
thinking you are
Nope
