One miscalculation & it could sever our ties with SK, or add serious tensions w/ China. SK has set both the pace & the terms of the recent negotiations (not Trump) and they are deeply invested in attaining peace w/ NK. Maybe it would be better if Trump sits this one out. ^^
Forgive me for having doubts, but other than tweeting & saying crazy things, it's been more than a year, and he hasn't even appointed a US ambassador to SK.  The position has been vacant since Trump took office on January 20, 2017.
Peace Thru Strength!! @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo #SundayFutures
Peace Thru Strength!! @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo #SundayFutures

Trump's screaming for diverting Chinese United Nations investigation into RFID manufacturing!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????
His sons holdings of Chinese stock,Wich I'm sure he'd rather throw right back into dad's hands immediately!!!!!!!!!!
For you Americans that didn't know, president Trump's presidency required all stock holdings transfered,insider trading laws, unfortunately his son holds????????
Oh jesus, someone just SHUT HIM THE HELL UP!
RIGHT???
We know which one the warmonger is rooting for
Lindsey just gets turn on by war, war is like his gay lover.
This guy is as bad as McCain. You need to quit Graham 
@LindseyGrahamSC Grow a pair, Senator. Just think where we'd be with NorKo if Hillary had won - we'd BE at WAR with them by now. Trump is showing Little Rocket Man that we're not to be messed with - he's serious about peace through strength. Maybe you should be too, Senator.
Graham is one of anti-trump politicians that needs to go away.  Between these comments and trashing the constitution by trying to protect the treasonous impeachment of the president his goal is obvious.
He’s trying to save his political ass here in SC by sucking up and “ playing nice”. Ppl don’t forget. Fox News can pretend to make him into a “ good guy” for Trump. He’s not.
@LindseyGrahamSC is nothing more than a political opportunist #RINO. He only supports @realDonaldTrump when he can score points on actions where he had zero involvement. #MAGA
And little Lindsay's just dying for war.
That makes sense, “it’s raining and sunny but cloudy....”
Lindsey graham looks like my late mum’s auntie
Dont worry 45th will muck it up
On theLiberty Report show Virginia  Senator @SenRichardBlack  questions the mainstream narrative about Syria: “Why would President Assad employ poisoned gas just after @realDonaldTrump said ‘we are leaving Syria very soon?' Whats the motive of Assad 4this?
Can you ever make a statement without then following it up with the threat of imminent war? Enough already.
Excellent refreshing commentary from Lindsey Graham Maria!...Glad he got a lot of his information out in the open!
Graham is a WOLF in RNC clothing he is damaging & destroying Trump from behind he prefers to protect Mueller investigation than protecting US CITIZENS  against MS13 gang or protecting US BORDER from illegal immigrants, Graham is a confused Bozo
South Carolina needs to vote him out

Why do u even put his negative face on tv
#Guilty #LockHimUp #MorallyUnfitToBePresident @realDonaldTrump
One more Swamp Creature that needs to go!
Thanks MR. Obvious. We are always on the brink which is why we need to stay strong. Jack wagon.
Why does this poor, double-speaking excuse for a senator still get air time?
Lindsey =loser
He's right. In this issue there can be no middle ground. Either NK denuclearizes  in ways that can be dependably verified of we will go to war against them.
I appreciate Lindsay being honest about Trump's successes--it must be hard for him to admit that Trump is doing a good job.
You can almost see him biting his tongue whenever he has to say anything positive about president Trump. It's a trait that you see in anyone who hates Trump, but has to acknowledge his positive accomplishments. Lindsey is a weasel.
And that is the reality... Iran, Russia, N Korea, China and Venezuela -the forces of evil have revealed their intentions and are making connections between themselves.
What is wrong with Fox News today? Every station is reporting on the immigrants at the California border and it’s not on Fox yet!! Why is that?please you give the true news.
No closer than yesterday
President Trump was kind to Comey. I am still baffled as to how Comey achieved Dir of the FBI status. The man is delusional. Can't remember, doesn't call it a "leak" doesn't see it as others. How???????
@NobelPrize If President Trump negotiates peace between America and north Korea and does not win the Nobel peace prize, the prize will lose all its value. All of it. They gave Obama the award in advance and have admitted so.
Or, we are very close to nothing substantial changing and the status quo - NorKs isolated and waving nukes around, the US and its allies maintaining sanctions - persisting. What is happening in Pyongyang - or the White House - is so opaque that no one knows what will happen.
Go away, Graham!

Don’t count your chickens before they hatch
Lindsey Graham is a traitor to America another Republican coward

War is ALWAYS in the cards for us isn’t it? I wonder why that is. 
Not news, just fear mongering...
Why is Graham so obsessed with war?
lindsay, great job at drum thumping...
The citizens of North Korea will never know peace. Signing that peace treaty without having them sign a human rights treaty is like turning a blind eye to what’s really going on in North Korea
Lindsey Lindsey. Always speaking out of both corners of mouth. Please retire!
Wouldn't be much of a war though. We would anihilate them very quickly.
If we are very close to war, it is because of dishonest politicians & media telling the world we don't support our President @realDonaldTrump & #Obama #Hillary #Kerry shadowing our president on foreign soil with opposition to him.
This malignant narcissistic pres didn’t and hasn’t worked on this alone. It’s taken other countries also to help.There is NO WAY he should get the Nobel Peace . If it actually happens then it should be shared. Trump is way too ego driven. He’s already spouting now @ rallies.
“Which is it” said America to it’s politicians...
The Rainbow in the Dark needs to go and pin and mount Johnny Wet Start like a butterfly. Homosexuality was a mental illness up until 1975 because  it is! The globalists are anti-logos (common sense) Prairie Dogs who worship Robotoad and study the Dahmer & Chocolate Factory Books
Actually closer to neither. Status quo.
We’re very close to war?! Lindsey, what are you saying? Why would you say that?
@iamsambee @robinthede @TheDailyShow @billmaher @LastWeekTonight @thehill
We all are praying UN is really sincere in his statements that he wants to denuclearize the Korean country. Hopefully he realizes the great advantages that await him & become part of the World Community and be a Class country.
SO MUCH TO GAIN!
If if he is right we need to rid ourselves of men like him who have proven over and over again that they are in it for themselves.
The same way Graham is very close to a principled Senator one day and the next, a Trump lap dog.
President Trump‘s first words to North Korea’s leader my words of war are true so are my words of peace I’m here to give or get either one from you!
DEAR LORD FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY someone is starting to understand. Thank u @LindseyGrahamSC for stating this truth! Spread this truth around to ur colleagues please. 
Soooo, total chaos then? Republican rule is amazing. 
Peace in Korea, but war between US citizens. Our "Leaders" need to bring this country together rather then lead in the tearing apart of our nation.
Trump created the war talk, then Kim takes advantage to get world leader status while keeping his nukes, and Trump takes credit for?
Well such is the nature when nations find out you are liars slaves to them that worship devils.

-prophet-
Preparing your people for all out war is also preparing your people for all outpeace!
A Legend in his own mind.  Thank God Trump was elected and not this old-thinking rino.
Trump is a wreck.
This guy 
Going to see @LindseyGrahamSC shortly st the @Jerusalem_Post annual conference ! Looking forward @LindseyGrahamSC

Says this weeks RINO
Typical alarmist...
It would be Way better if we go to war Well atleast send other troops to fight for us u know hlw america do Win pur battles An We will Lift up ur Shitty Comy State lololo
