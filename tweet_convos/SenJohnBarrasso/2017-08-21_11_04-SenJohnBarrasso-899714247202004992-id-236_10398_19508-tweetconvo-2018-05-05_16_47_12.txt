NASA:
Making my tail wag since 1967.
What are the other things above and below the space station?
Et phone home 
What are the marks all over the sun ?
Measuring scale?
Are you asking about the little x-shape looking 'marks'? That's exposures of the ISS. It's in the photo title.
Yes
was this pre or post totality? if the image is not inverted then this happened pre totality.
pre totality, I suppose. The flickr link has more edifying pictures.
then im embarrassed we missed it. had our eyes to our scopes for quite a bit from first contact to totality. wonder how fast the transit is?
5 miles per second. There's a nice video from @Space_Station that I re-tweeted earlier, check it out.
That's not a space station... those are tie fighters! @starwars #tiefighter

Best #eclipse picture I've seen so far

Nashville!!!
St Louis. Lol did we take ours at the same time they look identical

That's the first thing I thought! Tie fighters!
Do you know exactly what time it passed by? Thanks.
If you mean the ISS, that would have been the 10:44 AM pass.
Thank you!!
what an incredible image!  Can you spot the space station!
Space station my ass! Those are Tie Fighters!
Photoshopped
From satellite data/astronomy site Heaven's Above:
But your photos are beautiful! 
ThankYou for posting the 2017 SolarEclipse
Huh...
During the #EgyptianRevolution for #HumanRights of #Jan25,2014 flicker stopped us from posting photos of Mubarak's crimes..justSaying i will #NeverForget, Bloggers are still lockedUp #FreeAlaa @alaa 
Photographic evidence of a squadron of TIE fighters leaving the Death Star and still no announcement from you @NASA :(
Wow. Just wow.
looks oddly like a tie fighter...
Simply wonderful
 #thankseclipse
OMG!!!! Am I the only one who spotted the space invaders???
Seen by countless millions, Best Photobomb...ever!
Amazing how small the space station appears against the sun and moon.
So cool, seeing the tracking satellites
Would the ISS have been visible from Maryville, TN with the right gear?
How is it the space station doesn't burn up, do to it closeness to the sun?
Is that a joke???
Very cool! 
awesome picture of the eclipse
Awesome

@Anthony @Space_Station thank for still provoking and evoking dreams...
Photobomb of all Photobombs!
The US Enterprise from Spock and captain Kirk  @WilliamShatner is missing in this Eclipse picture 
@kavanagh Did you catch this?
Complete garbage #wakeupfolks
I'm trying to think of all the other photos @NASA has "edited" over the years? #Darknet #etv

Lindo eclipse
Bella
Now that's a sight to witness 
Can you explain this to #FlatEarthers as they are more confused than normal.
TIE fighters!
Real footage of eclipse day.

Best photo bomb of all time.
I'm sure Banner WY is a nice place, but you're a bit out of alignment. Did you score a bulls-eye anywhere? (not that a camera would see it)
Kinda looks like a bitten cookie.....lol.
Bulan bulat, Matahari bulat, Planet2 lain pun bulat, Apakah mgkn bumi tk bulat?. Jk tk bulat, Segi berapakah bumi?. ?. Cc "kaum bumi datar".
Jika bumi tak bulat, Di manakah ujung2 dari bumi tsb?. ?.
Nice photobomb.
Simply WOW!! 
Image of #Eclipse2017, made from 7 frames, shows @Space_Station, as it transits the Sun near Banner, WY. Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/nasahqphoto/ … 
That's no moon that's a space station! (Sorry, couldn't resist)
When teachers are as amazed by science as students! #SolarEclispe2017
Gracias a Dios; yo lo pude ver en horas diferentes y lugares diferentes. Que bendecida, fui. Amen.
sa aaa as, ,so ll es ou ô oder Z) 1st und-*
Ti-Fighters?
WOW!
"Don't tell me to change my tweets because then my 'tweets are no longer my tweet' " https://youtu.be/4chsf_8v0xk  @realDonaldTrump
Is it just me or are there lots of #TIEfighters? #starWars. I knew the aliens were going to watch the #solarEclipse with us
#ITHOUGHT, I WAS #IMAGININGTHAT ! ! !
That was quite a show. Thanks for getting us ready .@NASA
By far, one of the coolest eclipse pictures
@ProfBrianCox ..erm..thats not the space station they're definitely tie fighters
Down in front!
What a wonderful world (with all its horrific problems) we live in!
Sorry @NASA but I'm pretty sure those are TIE fighters #themoreyouknow
 its NASA antigravity 12345 
This is very cool! #ISS
Badass!!!
Fantastic photo clearly shows how @Space_Station crossing
This is fun hehe
That looks like an Tie Figter
WOW!!
Look a lot like tie fighters to me
or a TIE Fighter
Anyone else see the #xwing fighters? Or maybe that's a #DeathStar and we think its a #Sun #StarWars  #Consistency #ToFunny
Can you do a mic drop in orbit?  I'd think it'd just float around a little  ;-)
I'm convinced you guys have made a bingo game of space station solar transits.  [SUN (Free space)]

Don't lie NASA, those are clearly TIE Bombers docking with the Death Star
does that mean we are the forest moon of Endor? 
Too cool.
looks like the death star with small ti fighters coming out...  :)
Ok!!!! PAC man
That's cool!
Has anyone said
"That's no moon that's a space station" yet?
Wasn't perhaps the image made near Banner, vs ISS being near Banner?
Just incredible!
:)
I’m no expert, but those are Tie-Fighters. #CoverUp
