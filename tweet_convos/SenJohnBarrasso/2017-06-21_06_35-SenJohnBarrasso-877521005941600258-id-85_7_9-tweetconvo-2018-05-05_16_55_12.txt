Liars!  But new Deathcare decided by a Death Panel of 13 GOP Senators.  We won't forget that in '18.
What I'm most concerned about is the GOP loss in 2018 if they don't Repeal&Replace Obama care.Get 2work do the job your voters pay u 2do!
You might want to read the CBO report.
CBO says that by 2019 you're gonna have the same problem that this bill is supposed to solve: areas where no insurer is in non-group market
So fund it. Your party sabotaged the ACA & forced insurers out of the market by opposing the funds needed to run it ALL for political gain
Mitch bets big on racism and ignorance to save seats as big lie inevitably unravels. Not a dumb bet.
DeathSpirals are the Republican Plan. You're a Party of Tricksters and Profiteers. KARMA is going to get you all.

Because republicans and trumpp are deliberately sabotaging it! Ya jerks.
#FormerRepublican #NowADemocrat
YOU and ENTIRE GOP and TRUMP own every death that occurs from no access to healthcare.  DEPLORABLE giving TAX breaks to rich.  Bigots.

Trump has been sucking the oxygen out of the ACA. Do what you must...just don't lie. You could have tweaked it for us. Big mistake.
Nicely stated!! It's so frustrating listening to lie after lie after lie from congressional republicans & Trump. #Shameful
Hospitals WILL CLOSE. Doctors refusing certain plans as I'm sure elitist YOU never accepted Medicaid/Medicare. Cause less avail doctors.
Too many Senators haven't seen this Bill! @realDonaldTrump promised replacement would be #CHEAPER and #BETTER #ShowUstheBill Lift People Up!
@senjohnbarrasso FAKE REPORT! More lies from the Traitor Party!
If only the Dems were pushing for single payer. THAT is what people want.
GOP HHC Is the reason Anthem pulls out of the market.

I can't believe doctors take the Hippocratic oath to HELP people who refuse Medicaid, Medicare or ACA plans like the GREEDY SNOBS you are.
Hospitals AND us are protected by out of pocket maximums.  You get RID of that? Hospitals go unpaid. Now at least they are only out the OOPM
Doctors and hospitals have nontransparent negotiated CONTRACTS.  What they don't cover, WE PAY or DIE.  MEDICAL DEBT FOR ALL!
Insuance is a POOL. Not forcing employer or mandating coverage means EVERYONE over 30 will pay out nose for CRAPPY catastrophe only coverage
Why don't YOU have to have same healthcare plan huh?  ASTOUNDING your party is not empathetic to AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS who BUILT it!
@SenJohnBarrasso - primary saboteur of the ACA who did NOTHING until the Dems came up with a policy. Destroyed it then claim death spiral.
I hope you feel GUILTY when you bankrupt middle class with  healthcare.  YOU sir are ELITIST dr who NEVER had to WORRY abt huge med bills
Make no mistake. The steep increases in ACA are attributable to @GOP. Voters are not stupid.
Yet, the CBO predicts the GOP bill will raise premiums more than the ACA the first two years.
When you look in the mirror you're gonna to see sick people and dead people

John, you don't care about health care, you and your fellow Republicans only care about discrediting Obama.
Have to wonder how you sleep at night.  Lying about Obamacare, scheming, selling your soul..won't work for you, you know.  Payment comes due
How dare old men make decisions on women's healthcare - This is American Sharia Law!
#Resist
this is due to you & your cohorts.I get the WY isn't the most educated state but they can't be that stupid can they??
It can be fixed. You all just hate Obama so much u hate woman, kids, the poor the disabled. Give same options U have to ALL
Another LIE - The markets were stabilizing until you purposely sabotaged the risk corridors! This is DEATHCARE we will RIOT IN THE STREETS
Great to have a marginal Doctor discussing healthcare reform. All they want are the checks.
GOP has obstructed and tried to gut Healthcare to fund tax breaks for donors.
Direct result of Obstructionism of the Gop. Why do you lie for tax cuts to the rich h.
What would've been w/out the #ACA? What would've been if all states had fully participated? What would've been if GOP had worked FOR us?
Amazing the difference in states like WA where our politicians serve w/care & intelligence. Imagine if all states had supported the #ACA?
Liar
Saw you on CNN- liar. You pepper your message with divisive words like abortion. Hypocrisy and seeking validation with wife's pre existing.

20 GOP criticisms of Obamacare’s secrecy that now look eerily hypocritical https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/20/20-gop-criticisms-of-obamacares-secrecy-that-now-look-eerily-hypocritical/ … 
#ACA "falling" because @GOP has been boycotting it 2make it fall #TrumpcareIsMean "potus" own words Dems pay the price 2pass it you will too
Why did you just lie @on CNN about PP. PP cannot and does not use federally supplied funds for abortion. Shame on you!
Great evil is always done in secret.
Yeah, you guys are making it happen. Fix the law, which is working well for millions. Your fix throws the baby out with the bath water.
There is a simple solution for insurers leaving the market: Medicare for All.  Cut out insurers altogether.  Let them go bankrupt!
ObamaCares dying cuz trump sabotaged it. You don't care about healthcare. You aim to cut Medicaid/care, gut regs & lower 1% taxes
"When injustice becomes law, #Resistance becomes duty." Pass your WealthCare..see how long you last. Keep dividing. Keep lying. 2018/2020!
Pass it. Give all the corporate CEOs big raises. Kill the people that put you there. Take your lobbying donations. See you in 2018/2020!
Keep lying to the people. This country will not stand for Authoritarianism! We won't die fast enough before YOU ALL are voted out! #Resist
Pushing priviatization of HC while your FORCING your plan w/o NO hearings/debates/public/amendments is hypocrisy.
Insurers leaving marketplace thanks to GOP sabotage.
It's about people, not acreage. In 2017, over 87% have 2 or more insurers (and most offer more than 1 plan)  http://rwjf.ws/2s7UfE2 
Liars. #sabotage
Orchestrated by the GOP those pull outs! Sabotage
