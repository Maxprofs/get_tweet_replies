why have u accepted thousands of $ in donations from the NRA? Why did you reject the 2013 background checks bill?#Orlando
Condolences are meaningless without action. Save others from this fate by DOING something and joining the #filibuster!
.@SenJohnBarrasso @SenatorEnzi NO wilting pansies needed.Do ur job #SevenSteps https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2015/12/7-constitutional-steps-to-protect-the-homeland-against-islamic-jihad … #tweetcongress #congress #WeThePeople
sooooo what is your plan to stop from happening  again?
keep your prayers and ban assault weapons. Fight for our lives and safety not just to keep your job. #boughtbyNRA
Get back to me with your deepest condolences when you pass the repeal of the Dickey Amendment!
#EnoughGunViolence #RememberinNovember that's all I have to say
then do something about it.
keep your condolences. Today is your chance to correct you vote on HR 1076, stand with @ChrisMurphyCT #StandWithOrlando
Your condolences mean nothing w/ all the blood on your hands. Disavow the NRA and clean up yr act.
You also voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act—against protecting these victims.
, Sir everybody feels bad about this, but nobody felt bad on the #BIAFRANS GENOCIDE, are we not humans too??
Leaders dont obstruct so youre hardly a leader for WY. Youre bought by the NRA. How do U sleep @ night looking @ these fams
How deep? Do your condolences include a commitment to get military-style weapons off our streets?
If you really cared about your fellow Americans you would stop taking money from the NRA and protect citizens! #guncontrol
How dare you? How do you sleep at night?  We need laws that protect people not condolences! #shame
Your inaction led to these deaths.  #DoYourJob #GunSenseVoter #MassMurderer
I support tougher gun laws and universal background checks. Please change your position or I will donate to your opponent.
As elected official who does bidding of @NRA, you're accomplice to the 50 murders in Orlando. Worth the price of your soul?
Sickened that you accept money from the gun industry.You should be ashamed.YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS. Gun control NOW.
Your sympathy means nothing if you won't ACT and #VoteForGunControl #InnocentLivesMatter #OrlandoNightclubShooting
but isn't this kind of your fault considering you voted AGAINST blocking people on terror watchlist from buying firearms?
Your heart goes out to Orlando, but not to the community that was specifically attacked?  Classy.
Move to keep assault rifles out of the wrong hands, @SenJohnBarrasso .
You voted against the amendment that could have prevented this.
My thoughts & prayers are with @SenJohnBarrasso & the other 49 Senators who voted NO on closing the terror gap on gun purchases. @NRA
.@SenJohnBarrasso, your heart might go out to #Orlando, but your votes belong to anti-LGBTQ @FRCdc :-(
I can't think of many politicians at this stage that doesn't fit that definition.
Seriously dude, it's your and your colleagues fault.
oh shut the fuck up you cashed $26k from gun lobbies at the time of gun control  vote. U r a fraud and a disease. #ShameOnU
If you mean it, please vote accordingly on gun laws and LGBT rights issues.
Really?  Then why did you vote against treating anti-LGBT attacks as hate crimes?
your "condolences" don't mean a damn thing. Do something to decrease this from happening again. Be a leader.
How does it feel to be complicit in the murders of 50 innocent people?
Do you think the assault weapons ban you voted against in 2013 would've stopped this attack?
