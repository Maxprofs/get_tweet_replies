#ProtectOurCare 
No #Tumpcare 
@igorvolsky This is a succinct way to put it
You know he's a doctor, right? So if anyone knows healthcare it's barrasso. Not to mention 95% of his voters are rural.
Also, all his constituents are rural, but he refuses to meet with them, and no hospital here supports the bill. Neither does the state.
The state didn't support Obamacare neither
I mean the department of health. And while not at first, they came to see the benefits despite the governor not signing off.
THAT is the rural you speak of. Not to mention the clinic had rotating drs. Who's to say ALL of those drs are under the ocare guise?
But of course park county has a free clinic for undocumented migrant workers, which the state needs badly. But fuck all those people right?
If that's how you feel, pal.
Good 4 u for stating the truth about Medicaid & who it is TRULY meant 4. Children, elderly & disabled NOT those too lazy 2 help themselves!
WTF is wrong with you people? NO ONE wants able bodied Americans who are able to work, who can make over the poverty line, to use the system
Tell that to those taking advantage of the system.
1/2 So we fix the holes that allow a small % to game the system! I'm absolutely fine with that! Vast majority are fine with that! Don't
DONT Throw the baby out with the bath water! They are giving the richest an 800 bil. Tax cut by yanking care away from those that need it.
How's that help those the ACA has failed? They STILL won't be able to get affordable insurance And it will cover less. Fix the ACA for All
I'm all for repeal and don't replace. It's not our government's place to provide health insurance for us. No one is denied healthCARE.
We all pay for a lot of things never mentioned in the constitution like roads, police, power grid etc Healthcare is just as much a right.
You did your big donors proud, John. Way to go, bud! Keep putting $$$ and tax cuts first!
They gave just as much to #democRATS when they drafted their secret #HealthcareBill and passed it on Christmas Eve w/out any #GOP votes.
Paul Ryan admitted Republicans helped write Obamacare, there were 147 Republican amendments, and it was modeled partially on Romneycare.
Who knows whose butt #RINO Ryan was tryin 2 kiss. Non sequitur! Amendments r often used 2 STYMIE A BILL not 2 enhance. Weak pts, what else?
/1 Ryan is Speaker of the House.  Much more than you will ever be in the Republican party.  That pretty much makes it applicable.
Good. You know that Ryan is Speaker of the House. Does that mean he's always truthful? Like you, can he not prevaricate from time to time?
You're being evasive, says the person who is insinuating things by asking questions they could look up as facts.
#KeepYourPromise! #REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #FreeMarketOnly! #UnitedforFreedom!
Yeah they shift was in the name. Republicans are plagiarizing a Democrat bill. Both sides of the aisle have failed us. #FullRepeal!
Rural hospitals warn of effects of Senate health bill (via @Pocket)

NO trumpcare or Obamacare! REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! #UnitedforFreedom!
I am listening to you lie through your teeth. Your lack of morality & integrity is disgusting. @POTUS PROMISED us healthcare for ALL!
My senator not any better but grateful you don't represent me!
#FullRepeal waspromised to the people keep your promises we won't forget no replacement 
#United for freedom
4 several years now, Reps beat the drums 4 #FullRepeal. What happened? Socialized med'll be bigger thanks 2 our majority. Not acceptable.

GOP Strategy:
Bail out Obamacare
Set course for single-payer socialism
Take blame for failure

BRILLIANT. #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
This isn't repeal, just lipstick on a pig. POTUS tweeted repeal first then replace. Do that, except, don't replace.
The entire GOP was voted in on the PROMISE of FULL REPEAL. Get on with it or get out! #KeepThePromise #UnitedForFreedom #2018 #2020.
Yep, fundamental shift away from the values you once pledged an oath to - remember "first do no harm"? Taking insurance from 22M WILL HARM.
Did you know the ACA includes a rider for people w/ federal student loans? It reduces or ceases pmts of loan until student earns $32k
Did Brit ask you why you refuse to hold meetings in Wyoming with constituents?  Did he ask for phone logs showing people against the bill?
Your proposal harms patients. Remember DO NO HARM? The @AmerMedicalAssn knows #BCRA will harm. The @USCBO says it will harm. Why don't you?

WE WANT A TOWN HALL MEETING IN CASPER ASAP PLZ!! MANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU SIR!!!
GINA - Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, part of ACA, prevents discrimination by employers & health insurers - thrown out
Did you know that 10% of population have genetic mutations that result in extremely high risk of cancer?  Men, too? GINA Act is part of ACA
Don't want to allow birth control, but rape is preexisting? Covers viagara, but not b. control? Would they force raped wives to give birth?
There were no women on healthcare committee, yet bulk of issues are female. No birth control, but rape considered a preexisting condition
CEOS of insurers are wealthy. ACA withdrawal allowed GOP to say ACA was in death spiral-blamed on Obama & DEMS
Trump sabotaged ACA by threatening withdrawal of subsidies that allowed them to keep ded/out of pocket  expenses down. Result? They withdrew
Net Worth: $5.22 million. Median income in Wyoming? $53,000. TOTAL NET WORTH OF COMMITTEE: $85.4 MILLION.  Of course,they want a tax cut.
That bus the GOP is forcing over the cliff will sentence tens of thousands of Americans to a slow death. How does it feel to be a mass killr
DEATHCARE/NO HEALTHCARE TAX BREAK FOR THE RICH BILL.  85% of Americans aren't buying this BS
TY for splainin' how @gop #healthcare fundamental shift from #ObamaCare. Since #ACA structured LOGICALLY any deviation will kick your ass.
WATCH this VIDEO! This is how TRUE PATRIOTIC #American LEADERS SOUND. http://facebook.com/corybooker  Some folks all it COMPASSION EMPATHY #maga #rt
Your constituents back here in Wyoming would like you to sit down with us and explain this.
So nice to know you have time for Fox news weekly but absolutely no time for your constituents.
FACTS: Explain this to your constituents!
But it would be impolite to say they want to punish the poor and the elderly. 
@gop @housegop @senategop @potus #johnBerrasso #aca #BRCA #ahca #trumpcare TAX CUTS for the Ultra Wealthy. #TakeBackCongress #SEO @DNC #rt
Sure is "fundamental shift"! @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP, THIS is how u address #opiodepidemic?! Fund for ONE YEAR??
Page 133. They only commit to combating the opioid crisis for a year. As bad as the house version is, at least they committed to 10. 
Senator Barbaro--is it okay if I eat a high fiber diet but then only work from my company's restroom? They have wifi for a reason...!
Don't you mean looking forward to screwing over millions of Americans that you swore to uphold the Constitution and to protect us. liar
Do what USA voters who work want;repeal & let us handle our lives.  Do what fed. Govt.,was set out to doing; protect/roads/postal/migration.
Did you call this person or his offices b4 he voted? History of Barrasso votes.
By Defunding Cost shares/Risk corridors you admit are very important to intentionnally cause Insurs to flee & $$ go up so you can whine 2day
LOL We all know it was you Rubio &GOP who defunded cost shares/Risk in Obamacare that you now admit so important hurt your voters on ACA
1 provider in WY. Why R U not pushing for cross state line buying! Because the Insurance Companies said no deal, donations. Phony
Senator, what is ur schedule 4 town halls during upcoming recess. Please post (not appearances which is what u do on sly, but town halls)
You are the ultimate wing man for a dummy from Kentucky!!!
It just gets worse for you, John!
New England Journal of Medicine opposes BCRA: "We whole-heartedly oppose sacrificing Americans’ health care" http://nej.md/2sNknGm  
The numbers speak for themselves. MUCH more expensive and YOU explain HOW it's better care!
Fox News is fake news That's what u ppl want lies like ur boss tRump
The Gentleman from Wyoming is lying.  He can say why Obamacare is bad, but can't say how ACHA fixes it or doesn't make it worse for YOU.
People this is as crooked as u get  Millions in tx cuts to the richest in america
We're in room while writing health bill. Who actually wrote the bill?
How much money from special interest have u recieved from same ones that
u say the same lies over and over.  FIX OBAMACARE and stop w the derangement syndrome!
So, sat down with Brit Hume and spread lies and disinformation. Got it.
Tax Breaks for the Rich but No Healthcare for American's #trumpcarekills
Dear John Barrasso,

Here's what Ronald Reagan said about socialized medicine in 1961
We, the ppl of WY want EVERY. SINGLE. WORD. of obamacare repealed. #FullRepeal

CBO: Deductibles for plans eligible for tax credits go from $3,600 under ACA to $6,000 under BCRA  


1990 Roger Ailes ad for Sen. McConnell. Parents “almost went broke.” when Mitch had polio, so he fights for “decent, affordable health care” 
Yup "dramatic shift" away from healthcare, tax cuts for the wealthy.  SHAME ON YOU
"Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress.  But I repeat myself." - Mark Twain [Nothing changes]

This is not a health care bill!  It's a tax cut for the wealthy.  You should be ashamed of yourself...
Is Fox the only msm that u use. Why I it, is it because they believe everything u say ?
Really? It keeps 80% of the ACA in place and keeps regulation at the federal level. Plus a 50 billion bailout for insurance companies. Shame
Members of congress have to sequester themselves until they cooperate & negotiate for the purpose of passing HC.  No recess for Congress!
Why shine publicity on a bill that is so CRAPPY y'all hid it from everyone for weeks? Hold the vote, LOSE VOTE, learn lesson!
A majority of Americans favor a single-payer system. Why is that not on the table?
It is very bizarre how things are being spun I'm not sure how this happens?
Excellent job thank you so much
Barrasso helped write the bill to Destroy #Medicaid

Will hurt kids, the disabled and seniors in nursing homes in #Wyoming

#SaveMedicaid!
Anything that relies on either government OR Insurance paid health care is going to be a DISMAL failure.  Adios Republican majority.
You NAILED it!! Medicaid IS a dumping ground for able bodied working individuals and we tax payers and WORKING people are sick of it. TY!
Very True!
It's #wealthcare for the rich.  Just say it.  Own it! Don't hide.  #Healthcare #VoteNoAHCA @SenToomey
LIAR! My son works 2 jobs & neither offers insurance. You are taking his healthcare away! #Trumpcarekills
#HealthcareNotWealthcare
As a former physician, Dr Barrasso, you should listen to what physicians and hospitals think about Barrassocare, not the 16% that support it
Your interview a disaster
It's too bad Republicans are not smart enough to "fix" the ACA instead of destroying it.
Trump tells lies on this show too
Yep.  Dramatic shift...in the wrong direction.  It should help people not hurt them.
Yup a "mean" shift. Just ask Obama AND Trump. U r out of touch!
