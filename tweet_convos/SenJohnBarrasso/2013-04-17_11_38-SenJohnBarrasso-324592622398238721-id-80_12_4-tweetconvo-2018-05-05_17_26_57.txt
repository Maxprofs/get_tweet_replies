@SenJohnBarrasso why did u delete my quote from VP Cheney? To on the nail?
@SenJohnBarrasso received a whopping $17,349 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2008 & 2012. http://ow.ly/kaLjt  #NRALapdogs:
@NicholasYenson @senjohnbarrasso he is my sen and I will vote for him every time he is on the ballot and I donate to him as well
@SenJohnBarrasso why did you vote no isn't your responsibility to protect the Safety of the citizens you represent as well as USA
@SenJohnBarrasso you for real? You're an idiot. Australia has had no mass shootings since massive gun control. Not one. Gun control works.
@SenJohnBarrasso disgraceful. So much for representing the people's wants and needs.  90%?
@SenJohnBarrasso #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much were the children's lives worth? We will remember. #stoprush
@SenJohnBarrasso  Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? ... http://tmi.me/SvW7o 
@SenJohnBarrasso #NRA threatened election backlash.But NRA's #GOP candidates R losing.You betrayed dead 1st graders 4nothing. #DemandAction
@SenJohnBarrasso shame on you for not representing the people of America - you make a sham of our system
@SenJohnBarrasso You should be ashamed of what you just did. Who do you work for? Do you have a conscience? Can you really sleep at night?
@SenJohnBarrasso what a hero you are. You have helped history's most downtrodden victims: gun owners.
@SenJohnBarrasso took 30 pcs of silver turn your back on all citizens broke your vows to America you will loose your seat we don't forget
@SenJohnBarrasso This is nothing to be proud of. shame on you for selling out the American people. 90% of gun owners want background checks!
@SenJohnBarrasso Your vote on gun background checks; SHAME ON YOU!
@SenJohnBarrasso SHAME ON YOU!!
@SenJohnBarrasso  thank you Sir , God Bless
@SenJohnBarrasso I am sad that you chose to submit to the pressure and lies of the NRA. Consider doing the right thing.
@SenJohnBarrasso coward you don't represent the people
@SenJohnBarrasso - background checks do NOT infringe on the rights of gun owners, it's a step in protecting ALL Americans.
@SenJohnBarrasso Your assault weapons ban vote yesterday was shameful and self-serving and in no way representative of the people you serve.
@SenJohnBarrasso when you were a kid did you want to be someone's role model or help keep death tolls rising Well you accomplished one #idot
@SenJohnBarrasso Shame on you.  Grow a spine.
@SenJohnBarrasso vote "no" on simple background checks for gun safety? I will vote "No" on you !
@SenJohnBarrasso You goddamn dipshit.  You just voted against a bill that would DO EXACTLY THAT, FUCKTARD.
Sen John Barrasso ( @SenJohnBarrasso ) voted NO on #guncontrol vote. Verdict: Bad Decision Maker, Weak/Puppet, Unqualified for Pub Office.
@SenJohnBarrasso You are a disgrace
@SenJohnBarrasso Shame on you for your vote against background checks. # lack of leadership.
@SenJohnBarrasso Thank you for using facts over emotions with your #guncontrol vote and for protecting our Constitution #2a
@SenJohnBarrasso you are a lap dog for NRA!!! Shame on you for voting no on back ground checks.
@SenJohnBarrasso  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@SenJohnBarrasso  You are a disgrace for voting to leave open background check loopholes
Shame
@senjohnbarrasso From a disappointed retired disabled veteran, you chose not to stand for the safety of our children - our precious gems.
@SenJohnBarrasso 90% of Americans WANT background checks!Your vote was for the gun manufacturers! #shame.#disgusting
@SenJohnBarrasso shame on you for your cowardice!
@SenJohnBarrasso Your not interested in protecting the rights of law abiding citizens just your #NRAbloodmoney. #GunControlSavesLives
@SenJohnBarrasso what about protecting the 30k who die each year from gun violence. Freedom to shoot 30 rounds w/o reload more important?
@SenJohnBarrasso You are a total disgrace to America. May your "vote" haunt you forever
@SenJohnBarrasso 93% of gun households, 89% of Republicans & 85% of NRA member households support universal background checks. #badatyourjob
@SenJohnBarrasso Shameful
@SenJohnBarrasso moron
@SenJohnBarrasso  Shame on you. Enjoy your blood money.
@SenJohnBarrasso  Shame on you!
@SenJohnBarrasso thank you for helping to uphold my rights. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you
@SenJohnBarrasso Dead children don't vote. Nor contribute to campaigns. But I'm curious: Did it EVER occur to you to do the right thing?
@SenJohnBarrasso You are a disgrace to the U.S. Senate. Shame on you for not voting for sensible background checks.
@SenJohnBarrasso HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT ???? #uniteblue #TheBigBlueWave2014
@SenJohnBarrasso in other words, give more nut jobs easy access to military style killing machines! Your dick must be laughingly small
@SenJohnBarrasso You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@SenJohnBarrasso You are a coward who cares more about money from #NRA than children.  How do you sleep at night?  Disgraceful!!
@SenJohnBarrasso Hang your head in shame because your callous actions will result in more innocent children being senselessly gunned down.
@SenJohnBarrasso what about my right not to get shot. Don't we who don't want to shoot anyone have rights? Pitiful.
.@SenJohnBarrasso shame on you!!!!
@SenJohnBarrasso You care more about the rights of gun owners than you do a child's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
@SenJohnBarrasso shame on you for not standing with the 90%. Who exactly do you claim to represent! Oh, I know. Whoever puts up the most $$$
@SenJohnBarrasso -phony bastard. There was NO registry in that bill, just the opposite, & you damn well know it. Lying corporate phony.
@SenJohnBarrasso Re: No vote on extended  BG checks. You just spit on 90% of America.
@SenJohnBarrasso Are you f*cking kidding me?  Shame.
@SenJohnBarrasso Children will die, I hope you can sleep. Vote was cowardly and whatever your reason for voting to kill the bill is a lie.
@SenJohnBarrasso #gunlobbywhore #liar
@SenJohnBarrasso Thanks for voting for the NRA and the gun manufacturers today against the overwhelming will of the people. SHAME SHAME
@SenJohnBarrasso you are a coward...
@SenJohnBarrasso Why don't you protect our children from gun violence with commonsense background checks?
@SenJohnBarrasso Thank you for your vote on guns.
@SenJohnBarrasso How dare you crow and boast about "protecting gun owners"? SHAME on you!
â€œ@SenJohnBarrasso: Introduced Amendment today that protects gun owners - really?? How about protecting innocent people who aren't armed??
@SenJohnBarrasso SHAME ON YOU #SHAME

DEAR @SenJohnBarrasso - YOU ARE A PATHETIC EXCUSE FOR A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE.
SINCERELY,
90% of AMERICA
@ScoutThrasher says who?  A leftist?
@SenJohnBarrasso what a shame! You can't even pass something that AMERICANS want?! How much gun violence will you accept? #newtownbetrayed
@SenJohnBarrasso Congratulations on being a disgrace.  90% of the population supported the background checks measure and you failed them.
