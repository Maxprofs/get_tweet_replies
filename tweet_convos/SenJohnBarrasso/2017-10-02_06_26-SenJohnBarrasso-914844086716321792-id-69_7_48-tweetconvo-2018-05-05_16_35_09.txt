You’re to blame in these “difficult times.” Do something about gun control Senator.

With all due respect, your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient. Use your platform to make REAL CHANGE to gun laws #GunControl #GunControlNow
@SenJohnBarrasso You blocked gun control measures in 2016 after Orlando that could have prevented Las Vegas. #GunContolNow
Your "prayers" mean NOTHING given the fact that you voted against closing gun purchase loopholes. Get off the NRA's ass and do something!
Its not about calling wyoming home. Its about doing a common sense thing so people stop being murdered.
Prayers are not enough, change the gun laws. You accepted $26k in donations from the NRA.  You have blood on your hands.
Coal miners wife-genuine Wyoming-genuinely horrified by your phony words. Looks like you are owned by the #NRA #shame
Could give a shit less about your "heart." We need your VOTE. You think this won't happen again? #SensibleGunLaws
My daughter was at the festival and ran for her life.  When will you quit taking money from the NRA and ban assault weapons?
WE NEED GUN CONTROL NOW!
Clearly your 'hearts' are not stopping mass shootings. Pass gun control legislation!
Yeah but you dont give a shit!! You voted to let mentally ill people buy guns. You are nothing but a fucking coward in the NRA's back pocket
John, we don't need your heart we need your action. Stop taking $ from the @NRA and start protecting Americans. You're complicit in this.
Your Heart Goes Out, but what about your VOTE ? You voted that Suspected Terrorist should have access to explosives and Guns? NRAbloodmoney
The despicable GOP and the $$$ they get from Domestic Terrorist org NRA proves they care more about their $$$$ than they do American LIVES.
This is a recycled sound byte. You work for THE PEOPLE, and THE PEOPLE were mowed down. The blood is on YOUR hands.
I read about a "primary opponent"...you're just doing your job. #outraged. Count me in for donation to you this year. Just on principle.
Same WORDS after every mass gun tragedy.  No ACTION after any of them.
Your heart goes out for them..then how about your Vote for them and other victims.... Make a difference Sir.
You have a heart?  Empty words, John. NRA has you in their back pocket.
Not sincere if you won't ban assault rifles and bump stocks. Just lip service. Spare us your sympathies here in Vegas.
Remember that time you voted against reasonable gun legislation? Or how about the time you took gobs of cash from @NRA? This is on you.
You have blood on your hands you hypocrite! Commit TODAY to stop US citizens from owning weapons of mass destruction - aka machine guns.
Vote no on the #shareact and show this body of people you 'represent' that they are in your thoughts as much as the NRA.
What are you, Senator, DOING to stop #ViolentWhiteMen? #mandalaybay #StopTheNRA #EnoughThoughtsAndPrayers #ActionNow

Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas @splinter_news http://ow.ly/9SsB30fAAVY 
NRA has donated $18,349 to Wyoming congresspeople who are currently in office. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/nra-donations/ …
See Barrasso's pocket lining from NRA
Pathetic. Always offering words without meaning. You don't care. Do something, prove that you're an actual human being who cares.
But does your heart go out? Remember when you cast a vote that could have presented this? Where was your heart then?


Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands

Senator Barrasso accepted over $26 from gun industry. Where is your patriotism? You are supposed to serve your constituents not the NRA.
Why don't you stop gun Silencer's bill and do your job, or tell the dead that it's not hearing because of silence!!!!
Meet the 46 U.S. Senators Who Voted Against Sensible Gun Control Law *****john is one of the 46*****
$9899 in NRA $$ says you won't take action on meaningful legislation to prevent these tragedies. Another reason to vote you out in 2018!
I'm a constituent in Laramie and I want to know what you're going to do to make sure this doesn't happen again.
Like other GOP they will just say Las Vegas is the price we pay for freedom.  NRA whores.
"Republicans" = gun lobby. If Sandy Hook didn't change your fetish with unfettered gun access, nothing will.
Also a tragedy that the money you accepted from the gun industry at time of voting: $26,349.
#NRAWhore
Empty. Hollow. Complicit.
REMINDER: 41 Republicans blocked sensible gun legislation, right after the Sandy Hook Massacre.

#LasVegas #LasVegasMassacre #GunControlNow 
You voted against the assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
Remember when you took 26k from the gun lobby to vote against tougher gun laws? Such a shame you choose greed over the safety of Americans.
Remember that you voted against an assault weapons ban in 2013. Maybe offer solutions instead of thoughts and prayers. God likes solutions.

Inciting violence and intimidation for political aims is Terrorism. Your Leader is a terrorist.
It's only going to get worse before it gets better.
Prayers are one thing. Stricter gun control laws and better mental health care are what's needed. TAKE ACTION NOW! #GunControlNow
