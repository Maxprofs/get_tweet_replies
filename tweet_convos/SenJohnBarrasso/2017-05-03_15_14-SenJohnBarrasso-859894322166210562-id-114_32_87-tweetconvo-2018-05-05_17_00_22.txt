The only thing you ever protected was kick backs in your pocket and you will poison us for a buck
@realDonaldTrump  Thx to you so much. Keep on! I need to tend to other things. Final tally: 4 missed rains in Apr, 1 missed in May.
Great, when are you going to start doing that? Instead of working with fossil companies to pollute our air and water? When?
Trump's EPA dismisses half of the scientists on its advisory board
Good meeting on how you will get money off of the resources of America for your own bank accounts held in Russia.
"Protect" lol. Don't bullsh*t us.
This is BULLSHIT! You don't care about our air, water, & resources. You two are discusting individuals who should be ashamed. Greed conquers
Please remind @realDonaldTrump we conservatives voted for his campaign promises..like get us out of any unnecessary climate money pits.
What exactly are your plans for protecting our air, water and natural resources? Specifics?
#coalisdead
Hahahahaha. Protect. You're funny.
Really! Why are you trying to dismantle the EPA? Why are you denying climate change?
You are such a liar
And then you fired EPA Science Advisory Board Members.
Fox guarding henhouse.  Thanks for accelerating the destruction of the environment you depend on.

Sen Barrasso and Trump are making America sick again to give super wealthy a huge tax break. Very sick swamp thing. Selling Americans out.
Not the two most would pick to protect the environment. But the fossil fuel industry would.

Give us details then. How do all actions you are taking reflect protection of air, land, and water? Oh right. They don't.
"Thank You so very much, Administrator Pruitt"!  AMERICA TRULY APPRECIATES THE GREAT JOB YOU'RE DOING! ^5!
Were you talking about NOT protecting our water & resources? Because that would be the truth, you planet killer.
You've had meetings with everyone but actual scientists. People who have DATA & FACTS & EXPERIENCE at the work you SHOULD be doing.
Still waiting for your meeting with scientists.
Why can't coal co. and fracking co. develop a system to purify their toxic waste water? Why should it be our headache?
Don't allow coal mining /fracking co. dump  toxic waste water into our rivers and aquafurd. Make them develop system to clean it first!!!!
They are saying..."can you believe they put my ass here...dumb ass voters"
We know you're lying. Actually doing what the EPA does has NEVER been on your agenda.
