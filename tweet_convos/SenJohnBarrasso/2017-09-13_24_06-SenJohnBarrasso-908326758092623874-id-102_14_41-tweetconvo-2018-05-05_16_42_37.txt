Except the GOP HAS NO solutions, just wants to take care from 30 million people and give rich pricks tax breaks. #HYPOCRITE #FOOL #LIAR
Republican Repeal & Replace bill would make it not affordable for people with pre-conditions to buy healthcare insurance. DISGRACEFUL!
Hey Pat - You had 7 years to propose a solution but didn't. Why can't we have the same level of healthcare you receive?
I'm one of your constituents in Wichita. Please consider supporting single payer healthcare for all Americans.
Please call his office or contact him directly via email
Ttrumpcare is again a total flop in the Senate.
What ARE those "real solutions"?  You've had years to propose and nothing except last minute attempts. Do your job.
I pledge allegiance ... one nation, one payer, under God, indivisible with justice and liberty ...
How dare u take our healthcare old man!

Real Solutions = Allowing INS companies to raise rates, cover less, and make obscene profits. You are a true champion of the people.
What is a real solution? Oh yes, universal health care like the rest of the world has. The Senate embarrasses us all.
@SenateRPC @SenTedCruz Vicious Barrasso interviewed about people dying because no insurance, Dr. Mengele Barrasso couldn't care less
Used to think Wyoming GOP @SenatorEnzi was the most evil man in the state for telling Middle School Students to torture gays, not any more
Could you reference specific actions you've taken to make the healthcare system better? Your inaction to improve healthcare speaks volumes.
Republicans don't care about sick and dying, so they support the @GOP Mengele Plan, Republicans KILL MILLIONS TO STEAL BILLIONS
Insulin has gone up in price 3000% in last 25 years, while price of manufacture has gone down. CEO Pay UP 1000X, GOP are Merchants of DEATH
What "real" solutions? Only ones you've come up w/ involve hurting the lower income folks & rewarding wealthy...
Neither of these is acceptable. You have more constituents than the Koch Brothers.
Ignoring the wishes of Kansans as usual. If I refuse to do my job like this, I go to jail. Seems you just get re-elected.
Text 'resist' to 50409 and follow the prompts keep fighting for healthcare
Yesss I love resistbot :D
Aren't you all lucky to be rich enough to afford healthcare for your families? . #Complicit #YouAllMakeMeSick
Not you @SenSanders , just the selfish members of the #GOP

@BillCassidy is all over TV grossly misrepresenting impacts of #GrahamCassidy…
Real solutions? Like screwing o Dr your fellow Americans? No thanks! #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #HealthCareForAll #HealthCare
Let Congress buy their own #Trumpcare with their salaries, not additional taxpayer funds:  https://www.change.org/p/remove-health-care-subsidies-for-members-of-congress-and-their-families …  #MAGA #DrainTheTrump
Be a leader and find a few RNC & work with DNC to resolve ACA.Foreign countries hve ACA yet we can't come up with anything at all.Not good
So you prefer millions to lose their healthcare
Hehehe. This is funny. I haven't heard one proposed solution from you.
Corrupt @GOP always supports rich, while selling out vulnerable Americans! #TrumpCareKills #GrahamCassidy 
I'm sure that exactly what Jesus would've done.  The hypocrisy is deafening.
Only if the problem you're attempting to "solve" is too many people having affordable health coverage. But that would monstrous. Right?
There's this guy Jesus. He's the main character in a book called the New Testament. He's v. lovely. Ppl seem to like him. Check him out.
Try proposing a real solution.  So far the alternatives to #Obamacare SUCK!
You just hate Obama.
You are not serving the American people.
And @SenPatRoberts MUST be replaced. Another senator out of touch with the people of the US.
GOP hasn't put forth a credible, real solution for years.  GOP is Potemkin party.
Could you remind us of the "real solutions" the @GOP has offered thus far?
Give them another seven years and they might think of something.
What are you trying to convey here? Very obscure. Do better.
Tell us about your "real solutions".
and those solutions are... ?
And those "real solutions" you offered were completely rejected. Find another dead horse to beat.
Wow @SenSanders is trying to move the United States forward while #Republicans drag feet and whine about doing their job.
