Why would you even invite him. What could he possibly say at that event that won't include lies or insults.
At a Trump Resort paid with tax payers money, right?

But some economists say the White House's math rests upon a shaky foundation. http://n.pr/2yJ2GZK 
Will Richard Spencer and other "very fine people" be joining you too?
ask him to investigate death of a soldier, @SenateMajLdr :
THREAD 1. What happened in Niger.
Wow. Scheming to screw all of us.  And now you all will be guilty.  Mid terms coming. 1% & companies cannot drive vote. More Gerry mandering
Trump does not speak the language of The Equality State and you don’t protect WY citizens against his hate. #keepinitclassyinthe307
Excuse me while I THROW UP!
Why did you like this Kasie?
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SenateRPC
So is the GOP going to give Trump all the information Mueller has on him and what GOP gathered themselves, I know you will just ask Nunes
You have my sympathy

Traitors one and all.
Enablers, all of you
Don't forget the Pepto. Ugh.  I'd be sick that day.
I always see you standing behind Trump at press conferences. Not a good look!
Don't get excited, he'll accept any invite where he can spew his banal rhetoric!
Republicans are getting voted out of office for drinking the Trump Kool-Aid.
No one else with a brain was available?
Trump is the Republican Weinstein. You are proudly helping a predator.
IF HIS MOUTH IS OPEN, HE'S LYING!!!!!!
You really want to listen to that Blowhard?  That LIAR?  You bunch of sniveling toadies, you know he is unfit and you are doing NOTHING.
Is it going to be a surprise Impeachment?
Make sure he uses a teleprompter so he makes sense
You should be very proud.
That will ruin a good lunch   gop gone in 18
That this would be an honor is indicative of the lacking morality of the @GOP . You are bowing to a person so highly unfit to be a leader.

Is this meeting about all the money trump and GOP took from Russia? Yes people we know and learning more every day. Please resign all of you

You would be pleased. Keep supporting him to your failing.

Are you really pleased?
Idiots flock together.
Bummer.
Oh boy!!!  Bunch of asshats listing to king shitbag slugging back boiled chicken!!!
Sooooooo much
disagreement (chaos),
disorder (chaos), and
disharmony (CHAOS)
in the #Republican party.
Yet you can all agree on
kissing @realDonaldTrump's
traitorous big white butt! 
Sir,
Please do your best to convey to the President and your colleagues that G Sachs allum pushing for tax cut for the 1% is sickening
I'm pleased to announce your still an evil, soulless ghoul owned by compound pharmacies and the NRA. Can't even hold a shotgun correctly.
Great, because we never get to hear what's on that wonderful mind of his.
Having lies and deceit for lunch? Voters are smarter then you think. Trump LOST the popular vote!
#taxreform The Trump/Barrasso plan will raise taxes on the middle class.
Wow, get the shovels
Cause the SH%Ts gonna
get DEEP...
To listen to more lies.  Wish the GOP would model President George Bush and denounce bigotry and white supremacy.  Not a President that supports such hate groups.  #shame



Your support for a 5 time draft dodging, lies as he breathes sexual predator is disgusting.
You deserve this implosion

Senator, don't forget the desert-beautiful chocolate cake with TWO scoops of ice cream!
Pleased to announce I won’t have to suffer listening to his insincere, dishonest twaddle.
@LiveSquawk @realDonaldTrump @SenateRPC  Dems and DNC will accept donations from anybody but will not accept tax cut
Uhhhh make sure that chocolate cake is THE BEST so POTUS won’t get mad
Better make sure all the senators have up to date vaccinations before they stay in the same room as The Comrade!
Hmmmm... so your excited for a pussy grabbing rapist is going speak at your luncheon? 
.@SenJohnBarrasso the Senate oath is to the Constitution - not the trump. History will reflect your kowtowing. It won't be kind. 383 days.
You know, we would be pleased if you would accept an invitation to appear @ a Wyoming #TownHall.

NARRATOR: He did not accept the invitation
Don't know about you R's, but that would certainly ruin my lunch.
Trump steaks and borscht on the menu?
Trump is Full of sound and fury and signifying nothihg
Gerrymandering has been making the news. What is your official position?
It's disgusting to see how far @SenateGOP will go to kiss trumps butt.  Cowards and sycophants not leaders.
So you don't remember North Carolina getting blacklisted for trying to ban trans from bathrooms? Try Banning an entire religion from a free country. #UnpopularIsAnUnderstatement #GOPJokePartyOfTrump
I hope he doesn't.....
A True Christian Honor #fakechristians
Big surprise. He loves you sycophantic toadies fawning all over him.
I wonder what xenophobic things come out of his mouth that day
Very good.
