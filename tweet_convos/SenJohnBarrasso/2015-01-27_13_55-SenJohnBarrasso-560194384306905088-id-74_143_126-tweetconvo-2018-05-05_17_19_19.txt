@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner yes but only stupid amendment
@SenJohnBarrasso  Bills against women, the poor, seniors, vets & middle class. Wall Street and the Koch Bros only winners from GOP Bills.
@SenJohnBarrasso If by working you mean working against, you are correct. You do not care about the American people.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner corporations are people thanks to you
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Sure. Working to further undermine the majority of American Voters.
@SenJohnBarrasso This is total bullshit! and you know it.
@senjohnbarrasso @speakerboehner You forgot record filibusters, least days worked and cloture denials.  Oh, and #sabotage of president #gop
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Way To Go Guys and Gals!
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Do you two consider the 99% American people?
@SenJohnBarrasso You haven't even passed a bill yet that was made into law. This congress is already a joke.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Do you mean the KKK Nazi GOP Party?? What have you ever put the Senate Floor that you Wrote up for a Vote??
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner it's about time after 6 years of do-nothing Republicans blocking government!
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner and by "american people" you mean the koch brothers amirite? how many wars by june?
@willarddc @SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner. Its the pork feast
@willarddc. Which statement?
@SenJohnBarrasso The Koch's are Americans, I'll give you that much
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner just ridiculous , mere voting on stuff doesn't make government, your members or either of you effective
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner You are proud of the GOP obstruction that has blocked progress?
@SenJohnBarrasso lol. Bullshit. You guys make me laugh that you can say this but not say you allowed zero statements.
@SenJohnBarrasso Working for the American people? By re-investigating Benghazi and suing the President? What a waste of time.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner No. No, it's even more broken than ever.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner And by "people," he of course means corporations.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner just a group of whiny ass kids
RT @SenJohnBarrasso: Under Republican leadership, the Senate is working again for the American people.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner I don't care about amendments or tweets, just pass some bills and then override vetos
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Yea, for the rich people that own you.
@SenJohnBarrasso Quality not quantity. House is bringing up a vote to repeal O-Care for 55th time; have already introduced 5 abortion bills.
.@SenJohnBarrasso ironic how #HarryReid hit himself in the head, nearly poked out his eye & hasn't been around to see the #Senate work 4 #US
@SpeakerBoehner @SenJohnBarrasso nothing got passed when Democrats ran the Senate because Republicans blocked everything. #GOPobstructionism
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner yeah, looks like dems don't filibuster every damned thing...
@SenJohnBarrasso
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner If by "American people" you mean the Kochs and corporations, then yes. Let's count the filibusters in 2014!
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner lol you should be ashamed of yourselves for continuously lying to the American public, shame
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Not 47% of the people & everyone who watched you on 60 mins knows it. Hoping you cont to screw up like that
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner That means nothing! What were the votes? Trying to defund ACA, etc?
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner well when you control the house of course that's going to happen!!! DUH!
@SenJohnBarrasso I think it is wonder the Senate is voting of stuff again. Keep it up, vote on even the hard stuff.
@SenJohnBarrasso Rowe vs Wade
@SenJohnBarrasso The Senate is working to give more tax cuts to the rich, cut Social Security and Medicare and figure out ways 2 get around
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner  I'll believe when I see It. Republicans already caving on all fronts. O'care, Immigration, Pipeline.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Veto over ride & impeachment - we'll see if the GOP congress has balls!
“@SenJohnBarrasso: Under Republican leadership, the Senate is working again for the American people. ”
@SpeakerBoehner @SenJohnBarrasso yes for the 1% of the American people
.@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner yep it's about amendments.. Ofcourse .. on that count, how many bills have been passed? Signed into law?
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner One word: "filibuster"
“@SenJohnBarrasso: Under Republican leadership, the Senate is working again for the American people. ”. Wow!
Haha how dumb you think we are?“@SenJohnBarrasso:Under Republican leadership,Senate is working again for the people. ”
@SenJohnBarrasso ..I think u mean .. Against ... #Typo..
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner. Its about time you stopped the BS and got to work
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner of course you're not counting the amendments on #KeystoneXL that @McConnellPress blocked. Open process?
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner I want hold my breath, Careless and unimportant bills don't help only a few.  Speaker weakens this nation.
“@SenJohnBarrasso: Under Republican leadership, the Senate is working again for the American people. ” I wonder why...
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner It isn't  a numbers  game . Tell  the people  what those amendments  contained
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner LIAR ! THE ONLY 1'S RW-GOP WORK FOR IS THEIR BIG $$ PIMPS ! THATS THE ONLY "AMERICAIN" YOU PAY ATTENTION TO
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner How about your stupid keystone vote U can't pass
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner really? Seriously? Name one accomplishment?
@SenJohnBarrasso Possibly the weirdest unit of work I've ever seen, but thanks for playing.
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Now that's funny.  The dysfunctional GOP circus can't agree on anything meaningful
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner weird that senate debate rules try to favor the minority.
Adults in charge MT @SenJohnBarrasso: Under Republican leadership, Senate is working again for the American people
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner Oh, so the Dems aren't acting like babies throwing a tantrum now that they are the ones in the minority?
@JmsD87 @SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner. Remember when you were the minority. You put the brakes on
@SenJohnBarrasso @SpeakerBoehner and you've passed ... What?
@SenJohnBarrasso amend does not equal work. We all knew you and your ilk wanted to amend everything from ACA to the names of the 7 dwarves.
