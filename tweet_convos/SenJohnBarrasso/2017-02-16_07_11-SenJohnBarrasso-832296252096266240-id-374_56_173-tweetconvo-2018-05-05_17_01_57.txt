# Confirmation needed!!
he who has sued the EPA? #notqualified
Are you insane? He has sued the EPA 8 times and wants to destroy it. Do you actually believe your b.s.?
He doesn't believe in climate change!  He has sued the Agency he now leads 14 times!
You are truly insane. Pruitt will NOT be at EPA. We the people will not put up with this bs.
bs
You're joking aren't you? He's a disgrace to the office of EPA
Right - You must think everyone is as dense as your base!
.What planet are you living on?Have you been screened for dementia? Maybe early-DAT. @SenateMajLdr @SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA
Ol' Turtle McConnell is such a joker! Pruitt dedicated to environmental protection!! Hahahahahahaha!
thats why he had 14 cases against the very @EPA he's supposed to protect! Lying bags of trash
Wow! It's hard to believe you actually put that in writing! START CRACKING DOWN ON COMRADE @POTUS!
how do you keep a straight turtle face while you write this?
you want all that money you get from those polluters-- oil, gas and coal.
He denies climate change. That makes him unqualified.
Even you know that's a total lie.
Oh, it's just easier to shut it down.
Uh, no.  BTW, The Emperor Has No Clothes.
#shameonyou
Just wait until the 3000 emails are released. He is exactly opposite and you knew before vote. SHAME, SAD
Once #emails b/c public Sec.Pruitt w/b GOP problem, not just Trumps. Pick another.
Awesome, you will already be dead when Pruitt's jackassery slowly kills the rest of us.  Thanks for that!
You, sir, are a liar, disgrace & sell out! This is as bad as devos or pudzer! #GOPisTheNewIsis
Sad thing is Mitch doesn't care what we think, KY just keeps voting him in. WHY?
believe me, my fellow KY residents ARE paying attention and it isn't looking
Can't believe KY's support Mitch. Hope they wake up soon. Mitch is obstructionist
KY is definitely paying attention..
what a joke
.@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA How y'all feel about him lying to congress about using personal email? Heard that's bad.
did you proof read that tweet. It might need a second look.
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA Bullshit.
You are a liar. He doesn't support a single EPA regulation. Let's just poison EVERYONE'S water. #PutinsGOP
BULLSHIT!!
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA Dedicated to protection? Do you live in an alt universe? Be fair and hold the vote!
If you feel that way, why not wait til emails are released?
Yeah, maybe after he goes to jail for his shenanigans in OK.  Get it done before he has to resign!
 Yeah, no!
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA What are you smoking? He's an oil industry paid goon. Why do you want to rape the earth?

NO to PRUITT.  Coal industry was regulated because it caused illness and death. Look at China. Air unbreathable. #realnews
, I heard that @ScottPruittOK will fill the waters of Kentucky with mine waste. | @EPA
@SenateDems @SenateGOP His record shows he's against #epa VoteNo on #Pruitt if u value clean air & water.
April Fools is April 1st, Senator Turtle. Scott Pruit is as dirty as coal.
dude. No way, man. Come on. STOOOOOOP.
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA what a load of total BS. You'd be so rich if you could export your BS like you do oil.
you're such a blatant liar
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA ya'll are insane. Thanks for screwing us all over.
Karma will get YOU&YOURS if you ok Pruitt. The toxins he lets oil/gas co's release WILL get some1 u love sick
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnBarrasso
should we hope you know better, and are therefore lying, or that you're delusional and truly believe that?
doublespeak much Mitch McTurtle???
Scott Pruitt and Oiligarchy policies are the enemy of the EPA, and the enemy of Environmental Science.
Aren't you going to wait to see what's in those 3,000 pages of smut to be released soon? SHOOT THAT BOAT!
Is it 3000 pages or 300 pages of emails btween Pruitt &oil/gas co's? Either or it's still insane GOP want to vote b4 reading them
Oh, okay. As long as YOU say so.
STFUMitch the guy wants to destroy the agency by killing regulation that would protect the environment.
@EPWMaj @ScottPruittOK @EPA No Scott Pruitt is a liar about a mans death and incompetent. Drug info from Wiki  #ClaytonLockett
y'all should be ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.
great @maddow episode detailing @scottpruittok choosing execution drugs for #claytonlockett in 2014, horrific story
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK Screw all of you. You are bought and paid for by industry and could care less about the future
brillant, just brilliant.  Too bad America has less than 100 years of coal left.  Than what?
Dedicated to environmental protection?!?  Are you stoned or just that stupid?
more alt facts from MajLdr Turtle.
no he is not
black is white and up is down as well.
enemy of the environment. Bought and paid for. #resist
Umm... no. Earthquakes caused by fracking are Pruitt's legacy in OK. He is wrong 4 EPA.
You're starting to sound as delusional as @realDonaldTrump
hahahahahahahahaha.
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, , NO. #WEWILLREMEMBER #RESIST
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA. LIAR.  How many times did he sue the EPA?  Country over Party PLEASE!
BULL!!  All you and Pruitt and 45 want to do is GUT the EPA to dump waste and lower Corp waste costs.
Sounds like his emails are going to get him in trouble. Why are you tweeting? Don't you have to go kiss Trump's ass
nobody believes your  anymore. Go away now, or it's the stew pot 4 you! #TreasonousTurtle 
Negative. OK may love filthy water and earthquakes, but most Americans don't. #MitchKnew
Damn all of you. Dedicated to making you rich and polluted our environment and food.
Disgusting that these people only care about lining their pockets and no regard for our planet.
No he's not!  He's awful, hates EPA , he's big oil ALL the way!  OK native & we know!
You are such liars. This man wants to ruin/eliminate any care of the environ. You all are so deceiving!
I'm watching you lie about Pruitt's record through your teeth.  Protect environment? Ha!
I'll live with it if you can get the answers on Russia.
Worst possible candidate for this position! He doesn't even believe in the EPA! McConnell, you are a liar!
you realize we can read and hear and google stuff right?  Why spout this crap when it's easy to disprove?
maybe if he's so qualified, he'll do a great job of preserving the D.C "swamp".
by denying an evidence of climate change caused by humans despite scientific evidence?
This is simply not true and as an Oklahoman I strongly urge you to vote NO!
bigger question is will there be an EPA when he gets done with it?
@SenJohnBarrasso Wyoming, the largest producer of coal in the country for many years, wasn't even mentioned.
@sendavidperdue Ridiculous! He's sued the EPA many times to FIGHT protection of environment. I call FOUL!
@sendavidperdue totally false! He may be the WORST for EPA job. We're watching you, do rt thing for voters
wish Mcconnell would do his job and support prez
Please vigorously pursue leaks by the Obama Admin's Intel Community and their Shadow Govt
what are you crazy? He hates protecting the environment
Leave the ESA alone, sir. Animals are entrusted to us to care for and protect, not decimate.
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA McConnell pull your head out! Of course we know you don't care about environment.
No he's not! He wants to shut it down!
Don't lie to the people. It's not nice.
if you're endorsing him he must be a scumbag like you
You mean "exceptionally qualified to dismantle the EPA."
such a phony...  republicans don't even believe in global warming, clean water, ruining the soil and air
Get the cabinet appointees on board now. Moving too slow, Congress needs to keep up w/ POTUS!!!!
If you want to get rid of the EPA and you don't value the environment, then yes, he's perfect.
McConnell you are a CRACKPOT!
Are you crazy!?! Is this tweet a joke!?!
where do you get the ! If he's so dedicated why did he sue the EPA 16 times! InvestigateTRUMP/RUSSIA
#alternativefacts
he is as fake as your smile. Time to retire old man
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA no.
What fictitious world do you live in McConnell? #NOtoPruitt
And you want to end the EPA! You are already going to poison the people of the Eastern KY mining country.
HUH? Not likely.
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA Are you aware of the shit show going on at the White House? You REALLY should take a look
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA How do you sleep at night? I can't imagine a more untrue statement.
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA your president is nuts! He is an embarrassment !
I think that's what we now call an "alternative fact".
@SenJohnBarrasso @ScottPruittOK @EPA is that sarcasm?
SURE Mitch! That's why Pruitt looked the other way while there was 600 man made earthquakes in Ok. Last yr
Just as great as Puzder, huh? Keep trying to cram these nominees down our throats and see what happens.
Please! Suing the @EPA is not protecting clean water/air stop #PollutionPruit
climate change Mitch!
Someone who hates America as much as you? How wonderful for us.
dedicated to shutting it down you mean?
That's a lie!!!!!!!!
That is simply NOT TRUE. No he is not.
on planet crazy town
Are you being sarcastic here? Come on!! We are not all stupid!
he does not think climate change is real. Which shows gross ignorance of facts
you are a joke. Pruitt spent years fighting against clean air, climate, and water regulations
seriously, he is against every EPA ruling...how's that pro-environment?
nope
You are delusional!
bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit
so the EPA can be eliminated? No thank you!
really he sued the EPA cause it affected the bottom line of his friends,
Dedicated? He has called to eliminate EPA and it's protections. TOO EXTREME. TOO RADICAL.
The man eats smog and drinks sludge, give me a break.
you're delusional, perhaps it is time to hang up your shell!
what EPA? Didn't ya'll just abolish it?
your pretty funny , I'm all for global warming when Mara logo is under water
.@SenateMajLdr @ScottPruittOK @EPA we need a special committee to investigate trump and Russia. That is the priority.
what a damn joke!
Kill us slowly with bad air and water. Shortens life span--is this the $$ saving ACA replacement?
oh absolutely, who better to head  EPA than someone who sues the EPA.
didn't he sue them like 50k times and wanted to eliminate the dept?
FALSE!!
YOU AR KIDDING RIGHT?!!!!
Hope your planning on retiring b/c every effort will be made to vote you out of office.

The @SenateMajLdr must be a parody account

no he is not. Anyone who wants to terminate the agency is not an advocate for the environment.
puppet
you do know that we all breath air and drink water: and you turtles really need a clean environment
WE do not need clean water or air
Republican cabinet position interview Q1: Do you want to destroy the agency? Q2: Are you a rubber stamp?
this as you vote to repeal wildlife protections! What a crock!!
just what are those exceptional qualifications I would love you to be able to articulate that Mr. leader
Your constituents are counting on your leadership to keep our air and water clean. #Justsaying
You know today isn't April Fools Day, right?
We're quite confident in @realDonaldTrump and his choices. But we're NOT CONFIDENT in YOU or @SpeakerRyan in backing him
You really need to understand this Senator and Speaker. DJT HAS THE PEOPLE! YOU GOT DIDDLY-SQUAT
except your party wants to abolish it.
he filed a law suit against the EPA. Wants to eliminate it. What is wrong with you guys. Pals with Russia?
if by dedicated you mean he's sued the EPA many times & has failed to support any of their regs, then yes.
Alternative facts
I'm so curious if you believe your own bullshit or if you think you're fooling anyone
do you seriously believe the lies you peddle?
#fuckinghypocrite
All set up to dissolve the EPA, not even trying to hide it.  PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT!  #EPA
You don't seem to understand, Turtle-Boy. That buttface wants to close it.
