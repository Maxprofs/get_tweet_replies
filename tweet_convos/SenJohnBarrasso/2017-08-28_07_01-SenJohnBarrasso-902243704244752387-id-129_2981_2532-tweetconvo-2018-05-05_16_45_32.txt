Will you address climate change and #divest from fossil fuels? And commit to a green economy?
We think everyone should! One way we can take action is to use our investment portfolio to divest!

Donate to the Red Cross, not the Big Labor SEIU

The Islamic Society of Houston needs donations as all the mosques are open for food, shelter, clothing to people of ANY COLOR AND RELIGION.
Go to http://www.samaritanspurse.org  & you can find specific places to donate money, time & needed esssentials. FEMA will make people take vaccines
Pretty sure that the best way is to vote out @KenCalvert and vote in Democrats to raise taxes on the wealthy and then help those in need.
DNC PLATFORM SHOULD BE:FREE HEALTHCARE+FREE COLLEGE+DBL MIN WAGE-WEALTHY PAY FOR ALL
WHO wouldn't vote for that Republican or Democrat right? And we've learned at least one thing – the GOP represent the wealthy 1% no one else
Consider Salvation Army. During disaster they draw from their budget so 100% of donations go to relief efforts.
You might as well be donating to a greedy church...their mission does not support the LGBT community.
Red Cross/Fema/most orgs do nothing for sanitary needs of babies & seniors. Texas Diaper Bank/Islamic Society of Houston good charities.
How can I connect for help? FEMA why are yall taking so long to help me?
I no more want **
This reminds me of undertale
The Texas Diaper Bank is a GREAT cause. Red Cross/FEMA/many orgs do not address the sanitary needs of babies and seniors.
WATCH OUT for Clinton Criminal Foundations!
Please explain
how do I donate clothing and goods??
@HoustonTX might be able to assist
Why not stabilize flood insurance program & adequately fund FEMA relief instead of pushing those government responsibilities to charities?
Donated for Houston Texas 
#HurricaneHarvey 
Another good resource:
Excellent!   Thank you.
If you'd like to help people,have the GOP's party of the 1% wealthy send money immediately! There's really no need for you to be taking our
Trump taught us the rich don't pay for shit and we pay for everything so we're going to stop by withholding our federal taxes next year!
I would not sent a dime to FEMA or RED CROSS both laundry alot of money between them.  Watched to during Katrina
