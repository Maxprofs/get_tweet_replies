@SenJohnMcCain Please stop the #Benghazi horseshit and do some real governance.
@way0utwest @SenJohnMcCain Afraid of a little truth?  Keep exposing the dirt sen. McCain, real Americans appreciate it!
@billie_bonny the only thing I'm afraid is more waste from speculating over some imaginary nonsense.
@way0utwest @billie_bonny Bet Stevens did not think it nonsense.
@billie_bonny Bet you have no idea and are imagining a conspiracy when none has been shown to exist
@way0utwest @billie_bonny Bet you are wrong.
@SenJohnMcCain ,2 faced LIAR forgets his PUBLIC lies about WMD 2 justify his BOMB BOMB BOMB 'strategy to rid IRAQ of WMD that did not exist!
For God's SAKE! Get off HIS >>> @SenJohnMcCain LAWN!! Grump! Grump! grumpidy grumpidy GRUMP!! #GOP #Tcot #tgdn
@RonHall46 @SenJohnMcCain A Marine Colonel friend who spent time in DC told me McCain was mentally unbalanced. Saw him screaming at aides.
@lmitchdunn @RonHall46 @SenJohnMcCain I think his POW captivity damaged him permenently or it's male menopause.
@lmitchdunn @RonHall46 @SenJohnMcCain Right-Think he expected rescue but the calvary never came.
@BergVoice @RonHall46 @SenJohnMcCain I do believe he's fundamentally a good man, and I honor his service. But picking Palin, and now this...
@lmitchdunn @RonHall46 @SenJohnMcCain I do have sympathy for the man but he's taking his frustrations out on the rest of us.
@SenJohnMcCain didn't you say bomb bomb Iran #misquote oh no misinform
@senjohnmccain Jon Stewart destroys Sen. John McCain over hypocritical #Benghazi outrage http://zite.to/WT9Ami 
@Politics_PR @SenJohnMcCain Hahaha! Jon in February!  Try to keep up to date!
@CyberTech1Media @billie_bonny Nah, I don't need any followers.
"Horseshit" is a good way to describe it. RT "@way0utwest: @SenJohnMcCain Please stop the #Benghazi horseshit and do some real governance."
@SenJohnMcCain Sir really???!!?? Where were you during the Bush years?
Mr @SenJohnMcCain: How long does #Republican leader @SpeakerBoehner expect us to tolerate these #Comrade @BarackObama #LIES? #impeachObama
@SenJohnMcCain. Reason why he did not say terrorism is because if said was then next question is - was there adv. notice of attack.
Amen to this.. RT  do your job and grow a set of balls @SenJohnMcCain Please stop the #Benghazi horseshit and do some real governance.
@SenJohnMcCain who cares if he called it a 3 ring circus? The real question is why did Congress cut funding for embassy security?

You are making yourself look silly, petty, foolish, senile, ignorant, and like a sore-losing runner-up from 2008. THAT GUY. @SenJohnMcCain
The guy above ^ @FreedomFOA is an idiot. More evidence exist on bigfoot, you clown.  @SenJohnMcCain @jholliday36 @BarackObama
@SenJohnMcCain how can you not support impeachment on a lying president, for his coverup?? last i remember, Nixon was impeached for coverup
@SenJohnMcCain obummer has lied to congress/american people on benghazi, IRS now DOJ admits to tapping AP Phone lines. IMPEACH the Bastard
@SenJohnMcCain Let it go dude, let's focus on something relevant, Bring back the McCain of the 2000-2007
@SenJohnMcCain sorry sir, but you sound like a sore loser and you want your party to win 2016 so I am not convinced that you really care!
@SenJohnMcCain becareful turning on your friend John. Don't want to miss the next WH party. #SellOut #RINO @TBradleyNC
@SenJohnMcCain Keep digging for truth Sen. McCain!  May the sun shine!
@SenJohnMcCain to date you still believe Saddam had something to do with 911 and he had WMD are we supposed to take u seriously #wawawawaa
@SenJohnMcCain I love that the GOP keeps using the same old playbook..it has worked out so well in the past.
@SenJohnMcCain let's not forget the man speaks with a forked tongue and therefore one can never know truth from it.
@SenJohnMcCain What a sleeze he is! We were all so hopeful.
@SenJohnMcCain @massSNAFU John, we know whose side YOUR on& it's NOT We The People's side
@SenJohnMcCain @SenJohnBarrasso  Maybe you need to pull them up, because I did and he didn't say it was terrorism.
@SenJohnMcCain How bout Bushie totally dismissing 9/11/01 intelligence, outing CIA. ..could go on and on.  Jail Bush!!!!!
@SenJohnMcCain stop pretending to give a shit. Your card is up you washed up coward
@SenJohnMcCain @patrioticDAR

@SenJohnMcCain Is your obsession with #Benghazi #political? @DeptofDefense @StateDept @Senate_GOPs @SenateDems @BarackObama
@SenJohnMcCain Thanks for keeping track... Please stay on the Job!
@SenJohnMcCain You are more worried about if the President called it a terrorist attack than you are about finding who did it. Disgusting.
@SenJohnMcCain  What does he think we are stupid?
@SenJohnMcCain @Kathy_Amidon It's time for McCain and Obama to both resign!
@SenJohnMcCain Senator don't you ever watch the TV? The President immediately called it a terrorism attack.
@SenJohnMcCain @Senate_RPC  Add #fastandfurious #voterfraud and #IRS and you think no impeachment! Right. #Incarcerate is more like it!
@SenJohnMcCain THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!  You are no longer a "Maverick" but a butt sitting in a soon to be vacant chair. #worthless
@SenJohnMcCain bullshit - there is no contradiction there.
.@SenJohnMcCain Who cares what it was called!? Go find those responsible for it instead of pursuing a transparent partisan witch hunt!
.@SenJohnMcCain - slight difference in words. The REAL issue is making the video the focus for over 2 weeks when NOBODY believed it.
@SenJohnMcCain You make no sense!  38 attacks with fatalities under dubbya and you Republicans were silent . . .!  Witch Hunt Sir!! >:-(
@SenJohnMcCain @KHShan Obama is a sham and a liar. We know the difference. A special prosecutor should b appointed to investigate Benghazi
@rtimjansen don't copy me on your tweets to McCain please
@SenJohnMcCain Yea! And you said their were no Muslim with terrorist ties in the W-house. U R a fool or u lied.....I think both
@SenJohnMcCain And yet you still don't support impeaching him. That makes you almost pathetic as him.
@pa_hollyl @BettinaVLA @SenJohnMcCain mccain is in bed with obama & schumer pushing #amnesty can't impeach his bed fellows #tcot #nra
@1purple50 @BettinaVLA @SenJohnMcCain yeah you're right. I have great respect for his military service, but I despise the politician.
@SenJohnMcCain enough benghazi.do real work..drove under a bridge that is falling apart. repubs wont be happy until people die. GET 2 WORK.
@SenJohnMcCain >Wish you were this vocal on the "yellow cake of mass destruction!"
@SenJohnMcCain Perhaps you should get back to that hard hitting cable TV bill you're working on.
@SenJohnMcCain u'r kind of response to an attack of unconfirmed severity would have put us in 3rd war in Libya, then a 4th in Syria. Ass!
@SenJohnMcCain @dblutz I thought he called it a "political circus" and a "sideshow"  HuH.
@SenJohnMcCain @mikememoli John McCain is so partisan
@SenJohnMcCain careful McCain you will get thrown under the bus also.
@SenJohnMcCain - #Benghazi shows Obama unwilling to take responsibility, therefore unfit / incompetent to be commander-in-chief.
@SenJohnMcCain @WeGotEd @SenSanders 
McCAin, you are a contradiction! Do you see a war you want to start? Where?
@SenJohnMcCain  Obama lied, Hillary lied, State dept. officials lied,  Carney lied, but it's ok? The people who think it's ok are IDIOTS!
@SenJohnMcCain  Obama called it and act of terror. What more do you want? We need to move on and get this country back on its feet!!!
.@JustAnotherMo @SenJohnMcCain 
And a wacko bird!!!
@SenJohnMcCain HE MUST BE IMPEACHED..THIS MAKES WATERGATE APPEAR TO BE NOTHING COMPARED TO THIS..HE IS A LIAR AND LIED TODAY ON THE AIRWAVES
@SenJohnMcCain On the Sunday shows you gave him the benefit of the doubt... All of a sudden you don't trust your daddy #Benghazi
@SenJohnMcCain Non issue. Why not put this level of passion into all the inexcusable deaths that occur every day in this country by guns.
@SenJohnMcCain Obama contradicted himself. He said he called it terrorism the day after, then said he gad the same info as S Rice had! ?
@SenJohnMcCain I believe he said «act of terror» and.. um.. actually he did http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/benghazi-timeline/ … (though http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-waited-14-days-call-libya-attack/ …)
@SenJohnMcCain what are you trying to figure out!!  People hate us!   It's not our presidents fault.   #unitetheclans #dividedcountry
@SenJohnMcCain Will someone tell POTUS we are not stupid? #benghazicoverup
@SenJohnMcCain @mikememoli  Get off my Lawn!!!
@SenJohnMcCain incorrect, but thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you.
@SenJohnMcCain I wish u and everyone would create jobs instead of this lame Benghazi story.
.@SenJohnMcCain did you see that debate where Mitt was like “blah blah blah” & Obama was all “BOOM!” #ThatWasFun
.@SenJohnMcCain I dare you to do something, anything about it... PLEASE? #ObamaIsntWorking #tcot
@SenJohnMcCain check yourself, Senator: http://www.businessinsider.com/benghazi-libya-rose-garden-speech-2012-10 …
@SenJohnMcCain Everyone knows it was a terror attack, what we don't want is to invade the wrong country and waste 4000+ lives.
@SenJohnMcCain What did you call the countless attacks on embassies during GWB's watch?......nothing.....
