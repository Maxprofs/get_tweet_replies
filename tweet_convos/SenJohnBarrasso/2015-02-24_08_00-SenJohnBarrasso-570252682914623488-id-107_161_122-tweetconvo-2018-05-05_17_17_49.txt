@SenateMajLdr Will any of those 50 jobs be in Louisville?
@Crutnacker @SenateMajLdr 50 jobs? Thousands of miles of pipeline will be manufactured and installed by 50 people? Wakeup & use common sense
@socalcctv @SenateMajLdr Says the fan of Ted Cruz.
@Crutnacker @SenateMajLdr Common sense doesn't work in your world? You want to change the subject or try to marginalize my statement. LOSER
@socalcctv Your ridiculous Twitter feed marginalizes your statements.   It's never too late to gain some critical analysis skills, Skippy.
@Crutnacker critical thinking doesn't involve picking a news source to base your argument on. I prefer to do my own thinking.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs what about a bigger infrastructure bill that actually update water lines, roads, bridges.
@Mix_walker @SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs That was done when Obama came to office. $1 trillion stimulus bill. All squandered. #cspanchat
@socalcctv @SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs unemployment and jobs started to slowly come back.
@Mix_walker @SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs It only compiled our troubles. The money was squandered and roads still crumbling.
@SenateMajLdr  An excellent job Senator! It's now clear the #POTUS & #Democrats are keeping jobs from #America & shipping oil most unsafely.
@SenateMajLdr Worst idea of an "infrastructure jobs bill" *ever*. You really should be ashamed.
@iVote4USA @SenateMajLdr you troll. Propaganda is immoral and you should just kill yourself.
@SenateMajLdr That's funny - "the bi-partisan #KeystoneXL jobs & infrastructure bill" purchased by #BigOil #KochBros - Hopefully he'll veto
@Truthbuster @SenateMajLdr Moron. The DOT predicted 10 oil tanker cars per year will derail costing Americans billions. KXL would stop that
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Obama won't act because this bill was passed. The State Dept is finishing its report.
@benintn @SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs The state department finished its report already. Obama would rather see oil train cars derail 10 per/yr
@SenateMajLdr Ya and he VETOed IT
.@SenateMajLdr @ENR_GOP Where does the President write "veto"? At the bottom or just all over it?
@SenateMajLdr noo @BarackObama
@SenateMajLdr žtgdt
@SenateMajLdr I worry the old guard doesn't have the interest of their constituents in mind.All of them ,not the few.This is a big 0 for us
@SenateMajLdr Oh...so this is a jobs bill?  How many? How long?...that's right ..you folks don't believe in climate change & poisoning earth
@SenateMajLdr NO KEYSTONE!
@SenateMajLdr How stupid R U?  Did the dems promise again??  They lie and so do U.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs on the the DHS bill, your being a coward!!!
@SenateMajLdr it's cheaper to grow marijuana extract the oil and run by Diesel get a clue
.@SenateMajLdr so what! That and 1.50
 Will get you a cup of coffee. Shame be on you.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs #OverrideKeystoneVeto
@SenateMajLdr Says the DHS bill reflects both points of view: The House Republicans' side and The Senate Republicans' side. @McConnellPress
@SenateMajLdr : I would hope people see obama for what he is, a puppet. The very rich didn't want the pipeline b/c  it cut into their profit
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner Yes you GOP crooks certainly did & got the exact response you wanted, you pathetic, small minded, inept bunch.
@SenateMajLdr how exactly is this a jobs bill and not a give away to lobbyists?  A true jobs bill would fix the failing US infrastructure
@SenateMajLdr   I've known for years he would veto the bill. Worst president we have ever had
@SenateMajLdr @SonieNcmrs OH SHIT. Reid is Still Running The Senate. Mr. Hussein McConnell, I Want to See You Tared & Feathered. Traitor
Returned to sender. MT @SenateMajLdr: Today, America's New Congress sent the #KeystoneXL bill (S.1) to the President.
@SenateMajLdr LOL .... LOL ..... Mitch, do you mean THE GUARANTEED TO POLLUTE THE OGALLALA AQUIFER WHILE SERVING NO USEFUL PURPOSE BILL
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress @SpeakerBoehner Is this the same bill that netted approx $250k per voting senator from big oil companies?
@SenateMajLdr it's time to stop the democrats filibuster do what Harry Reid did
@SenateMajLdr And he vetoed it in less than an hour. #BackToTheGrindstone #KeystoneXL
@SenateMajLdr
@SenateMajLdr 
So Sen?  How is this an infrastruct jobs bill?  When jobs bills like this were proposed by Dems you cried waste!  Fuck you!
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress LOL Veto.
@SenateMajLdr smarter of you to add the word "infrastructure" to the title of this year's iteration of Transcanada's pipeline legislation.
@SenateMajLdr but ur lying about LONG TERM JOBS TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY ! only 50 jobs a yr after built welcome to twitter Mcconnell
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress leader and McConnell in same sentence is oxymoron
@SenateMajLdr @McConnellPress Over Ride the Veto and get on with Business. No more Excuses.
@SenateMajLdr no reason to veto, but we all know the president, no progress
@SenateMajLdr @HouseSmallBiz 
After the president vetoes it, what next?
@SenateMajLdr Apparently America's New Congress thinks it's job is to the bidding of a foreign corp in the guise of creating (35) jobs.
@SenateMajLdr Apparently America's New Congress thinks it's job is to the bidding of a foreign corp in the guise of creating (35) jobs.
@SenateMajLdr and then Obama Veto'ed it.  #DoNothingCongress
@SenateMajLdr Apparently America's New Congress thinks it's job is to the bidding of a foreign corp in the guise of creating (35) jobs.

@SenateMajLdr Good job, more bills faster!
@SenateMajLdr Oh stop! Tell the Truth!
@SenateMajLdr infrastructure is roads, bridges,  grids, etc. ... cut the lying crap!!!
@SenateMajLdr @nielslesniewski actually today's "new" congress ain't so new.  Round II of #GOP sponsored shut downs.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner I don't like to breathe tar smoke. Neither do my kids or grandkids. Stop this nonsense. Find clean energy.
@SenateMajLdr @RepScottRigell @vademocrats I am sure the people of KY and VA you are focusing on Canadian energy interests first!
Fixed it MT @SenateMajLdr Congress sent bipartisan #KeystoneXL i̶n̶f̶r̶a̶s̶t̶r̶u̶c̶t̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶j̶o̶b̶s̶ polluter profits bill to the President
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnBarrasso D.O.A.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner That needs to be burned in a trash can.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner this is more important than the DHS funding?
@SenateMajLdr He won't sign it , I wish he would, but I'm an American Who HE could careless about !
@SenateMajLdr jokes
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner you need to drop the word leader from your name! You definitely aren't that!

@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner
@SenateMajLdr just because you're too greedy to believe human caused climate change, doesn't mean the rest of us are! #NoKXL VETO #Keystone
@SenateMajLdr @DBrandewie ~50k temp jobs, 60 perm jobs, a jobs bill. Right! About a weeks worth of the jobs America needs. Big woop!
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner Keystone a small start. But you must stop Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty by any means necessary,
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner you mean the "polute America screw anyone who gets in our way" bill?
Willie says no! .. RT @SenateMajLdr: Today America's New Congress sent the bipartisan #KeystoneXL infrastructure jobs bill to the President.
.@SenateMajLdr .@SpeakerBoehner  Giving in to another amnesty are you? http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/republicans-blink-on-immigration …

@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner Man Drama. Sign it, make China happy so we can talk about the real isses.
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner Yes and you will get a veto pen up the butt.
@SenateMajLdr @JohnCornyn you think 35 jobs = a jobs bill? pathetic!
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner Oh, also, because it does not provide additional energy independence! Personally, I would have signed it.
@SenateMajLdr Oil spill tragedies can now be avoided with Earth Safe Pipeline containment and detection technology
@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerBoehner Where it shall die a quick death because it fails to create significant jobs and poses environmental risks!
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs Americans are first ! Remember Americans voted nov. Not illegals
@SenateMajLdr Be ready for POTUS Veto.
@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs 49 states have ISIS in them due to this immigration act.

@SenateMajLdr @Senate_GOPs #DefundDHS they letting illegals in USA. They can't stop them. They don't need payed. Give funds to military
