Nice.  More of this needs to happen.
Now that is interesting!

Wow! In solidarity. 
This is great news! But at the same time, it's kind of sad that it's such a big thing.

As an American, I moved to Norway and was amazed when told that PhD students are treated as employees and in union with lecturers + other staff. Others here were amazed we weren't, back in US.
This Harvard alum approves
Would someone mercifully explain what will come of this?  Much appreciated!
Harvard doesn’t work unless TAs and RAs do!
Hell yeah
This is great!
Hoorah
Unite! Hell yes.
I was told students could have a union.
BREAKING: In a historic move, Harvard teaching and research assistants have voted to form a union. http://ow.ly/Vdna30jBiTc 
This is good... but it’s kinda hard to get terribly excited for very-soon-to-be 1%-ers doing an entirely self-serving thing, no matter how progressive.
Not quite. Most teaching and research assistants go on to be professors, whose salaries are not at all that high. I can personally vouch for that.
That’s fair, but I would reeeeeeally like to see just what percentage of former Harvard assistants end up making under six figures at some point in their lives. 

I’ve no idea and I’m willing to be proven wrong, but I would bet my front teeth that it is very very low.
Their job prospects after academia, I dare say, are considerably cushier and more lucrative (by a whole, whole lot) than your average community college grad or, y’know, non-college people. 

I mean... this is great. Yay. But I find it really difficult to care about them.
hell yeah babiyeee up the union
But, but...@Harvard started as a #seminary. () They wouldn't mistreat their TA's, would they?
Check it:
do they all have purple hair?
There wasn't one?  Welcome to the early 20th century my dudes!
Worrrrrd
Is Harvard losing some of its crimcrim?
