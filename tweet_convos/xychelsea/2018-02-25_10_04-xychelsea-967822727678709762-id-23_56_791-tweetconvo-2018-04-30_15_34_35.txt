This picture is a perfect advertisement for post birth abortion...
Did you impress upon the Bard students that they should Fuck the Police?

Bard College > Harvard
Cool. (I see you showing off those gams, too.)
That's me!!! This was such a great experience
Iâ€™m so happy my alma mater treated you well!!

I see a lot of pronouns #ManningForVeterans

This is a perfect postcard for Mental Illness Awareness Month.  Nice job Brad.
Your post is actually moreso. I can tell you seem to be hallucinating and being delusional in general. The amount of people that support Chelsea far outweight the ones that are against her, but the majority of people that are against her still call her chelsea.
Cute dress 
Your profile picture is creepy
what a dashing group of people. y'all make my heart happy 
Lovely photos :)
