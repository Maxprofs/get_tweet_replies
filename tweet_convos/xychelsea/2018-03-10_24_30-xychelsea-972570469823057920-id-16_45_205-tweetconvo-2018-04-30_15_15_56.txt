Can't you just do a later slot? All of us jetlaged europeans would be very grateful. 
Chelsea is not even a morning person and she made it. You snooze, you lose. Get with the program
Honey, I was there!

You were amazing, Chelsea! Got up early for you and I’m not a morning person either. I’m so glad you made it!!  Resist!
Hope this is filmed and shared
SxSW records many presentations and later posts to Soundcloud. A nice benefit for those who can’t attend. This will be a super popular session.  
Can’t  wait to see you! On our way.
How long are you in town for?
