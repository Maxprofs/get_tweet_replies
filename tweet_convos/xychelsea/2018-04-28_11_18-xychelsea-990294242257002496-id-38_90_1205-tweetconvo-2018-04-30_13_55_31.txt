what are you a pokemon now
Be eevee, at least you have 7 of them.

THIS ISN’T EVEN YOUR FINAL FORM!!!
You're a politician now, so you are kinda like a Pokemon, you want people to go into the voting booth and say "Chelsea Manning, I choose you for U.S. Senate".
Corporate Democrats: "Prepare for trouble! And make it double!Team Rocket blasts off at the speed of light! Surrender now, or prepare to fight!"

Ben Cardin: "Meowth! That's right!"

Pokemon Omega Ruby And Alpha Sapphire Bulbasaur evolve into Ivysaur
Did you sign it #traitor? Or #sellout ?
she signs it 'jay is triggered'
LOL
Just making it up as you go along.
I've caught you a couple times I think, and I've had to release you every time because you keep putting my childhood fears on the internet, and I have no idea how you keep getting the information.
I've caught manning 2x but each time she has a complete meltdown, attempts suicide and then tells wiki the location of the other characters
Yea that's not where I was going with that.
Traitorzard?
Yes, the true politician is usually reptilian in form.
