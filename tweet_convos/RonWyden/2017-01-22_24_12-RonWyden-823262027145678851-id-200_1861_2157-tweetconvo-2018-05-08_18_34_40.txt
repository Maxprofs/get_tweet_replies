Americans do care about @realDonaldTrump's tax returns.

So let's show him we do. Sign https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/immediately-release-donald-trumps-full-tax-returns-all-information-needed-verify-emoluments-clause-compliance …
With @realDonaldTrump breaking his promise to release tax returns Congress must pass Presidential Tax Transparency Act #releasethereturns
Senator, how can citizens promote/support the passage of this bill? When will it come up for vote? #releasethereturns
Thank you for sticking with this, Senator Wyden. Don't stop!
'broken promise' is of course a politically correct way of say he patently lied.
he never had intention of doing so. His calculation: if he lost, it would hurt him, if he won, it wouldn't benefit him.
Is this even legal? I was under impression it was the law.
No, just decades of precedent—no law has been needed til now! There may be one in a few yrs once D's get control again!
Yes, time for a new law - All candidates must release tax returns, period, or no Office!
also need to abolish the electoral college and get control of policies health care and salaries.
that should be politicians health care. We pay for it. Why don't we decide what we pay for? #resist
They were covered by ACA…but THEY can simply go back to FEHB, not so simple for everyone else!
What is FEHB? @shiggybythebay @betsycam @RonWyden
Federal Employees Health Benefits – the health plan that covers fed employees.
Were you surprised?
Not a bit. He's only in this for the money. His taxes will show us his motives. #Resistance
he owes lots of $ to Russians & will try to use Presidency to plunder treasury for own benefit
I believe it.
@steeljawpanda there's a shocker.
If you LIKE your doctor, you can KEEP your doctor. I would not be talking if *I* were you.
So put your big boy pants on and stand up the the CLOWN
He is now, and always has been, a loar. He is either that or on mid stage senility and forgetful. Either way he must go. Danger!!
#AnotherTrumpLie #LieBigly
It's like he's a liar.
So what's the high water mark on number or size of broken promises?  What's too far for you, Senator?
@GreatDismal After the "Qatar" foundation of Clinton's and Iran deal treason by Obama, tax release got lost in the shuffle.
It's not a broken promise, it's an "alternative oath."
Sure, voters are frauds but this asshole won't even release tax returns after he said he would.
@slack2thefuture what's #dodgyDonald hiding? 
@DemsTalk that's all he is, Bullshit artist. More retaliation because of march, he knows his taxes will get him impeached traitor
@DemsTalk R u really surprised? Seriously? Has he or will he ever do anything he promised? Nope...just the opposite #ImpeachTrump
Surprised he lied? I'm not.
The phrase after the comment in first twit 'not after election!' Seems to be operative here.
@alan_hawk62 50 mil people can April 15
@hrh_mchapman Time for somebody at the IRS to go wikileaks on them… 
that's because he's a liar. #LiarInChief please Mr. Wyden impeach this man fast.
He hasn't even provided proof there is an audit or documented which years may be covered. IRS letters, perhaps?
What will you do about it?
Here's the link to the petition asking Trump to release his taxes.https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/immediately-release-donald-trumps-full-tax-returns-all-information-needed-verify-emoluments-clause-compliance …
@realDonaldTrump Everyone, keep signing the petition until it's in the millions! https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/immediately-release-donald-trumps-full-tax-returns-all-information-needed-verify-emoluments-clause-compliance …
Ron, everything out of that man's mouth is a lie, so I'm not surprised.
omg!! We are still on this?!! I'll dodge stupid taxes as much as I can too. You want more? Come get it!
can we see yours, or can we see anything you have done with all of our money. I'm sure you'll blame legislation you controll.
lie after lie after lie
@OffTimeRadio in other news, Trump signs 3 new executive orders today.
Big Promises Kept.

How's that tally sheet looking?

@RonWyden Since Traitors Own All Branches of Gov't, Try This~> IC "Warrant To Produce" for Nat'l Sec Investigation
Trump promised to release his tax returns after the audit was complete. Now saying he won’t ever.

Big broken promise. 
I know. Kelly Ann just scaled over that.
Why don't we start at the beginning and ask him to prove he's under audit. That is the lie. You get an IRS notice, where's his?
I read this . Nowhere does it say I promise. Can you point it out, maybe I missed it. PLEASE show me!
Obama promised records and then sealed them on day 1.
we cared about the candidates tax returns why not be concern about Trump's.
an obvious lie.  He had no intention of releasing his tax returns.  IRS said could release returns if under audit.
@Jtatl1996  Release yours! Liberals care little for tradition until it suits them! Time for change!
@pierre 
Gee, I wonder why Donny doesn't want us to see his taxes?
Ammunition for impeachment?
kind of like you breaking your promise of standing up for ALL Oregonians
Significant broken promise. It means he is hiding somthng big. Can we trust him? Has @realDonaldTrump lied to us recently?
@pierre Everyone is interested in seeing Mr. Trump's tax returns. If, he has nothing to hide... There should not be a problem.
Returns only released to avoid political fallout. Trump is past that, why should he? Perhaps in 2020, if seen as required.
@french_monica #TrumpTheA__Hole can release earlier years of taxes. #TrumpReleaseYourtaxes
How can he? We'd know about Russia then.
Not even surprised.
obviously something there he doesn't want his competitors and the public to know.
Classic bait and switch from a consummate confidence man.
@AttorneyCrump the first of many broken promises to come.! Watch out trump supporters, he's gonna get you
conflict of interest
did u really think he would?
if and when he produces them, I'm betting they'll be so heavily falsified.  He's likely holding out so his lawyers can waterproof
we already know he's a flat-out, bold-faced liar.  And we need to focus on how to un-seat him.
That's what liars do. They lie. Wish we could clone you in MD where @BenCardinforMD & @ChrisVanHollen are mute & ineffective.
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
Stay strong, Mr. Wyden! XO
You csnnot believe anything he says.  He reverses it at will

Broken as child & evil as adult, @realDonaldTrump's a fear/hate-soaked id pile & lies aren't just views/actions but his only self.
Most of @realDonaldTrump's constituents don't file returns or at best submit an EZ Form. Bottom feeders are easily manipulated.
keep it up. Don't back off.
obviously hiding something ...Crooked whom again ?
Are you surprised?
What a miracle !
thank you for the work you're doing, and I hope you can pass the Presidential Tax Transparancy Act
Thank you. I astounded by the capricious behavior of this man. He held Obama to a high standard. Now he has to live up to it.
bad #DonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump ..lying and part of the swamp ..we want to see his tax returnd Bad! Bad!
@Smith83K Trump got what he wanted by saying what people wanted to hear. Then no delivery. Bait and switch. #RESISTANCE
Fine. Subpoena the returns when the inevitable litigation starts. He'll try to bully & tweet his way out, of course.
@EclecticLizzie omg get over it! We dont care!
@Smith83K Another corrupt liberal who's gravy train is coming to an end.
@Smith83K
trump we now know is a congenital liar
Nah. Just an alternative promise.
@ORDems Tump lied through the election, after the election what makes you think he will be honest now? Thanks for working for us.
HE NEVER PROVED HE WAS UNDER AUDIT ANYWAY!
Pass the law prevent lifting sanctions against Russia. @maddow did show on Exxon land in Russia with oil they want. CountryBeDamnd

This is GREAT #TheResistance #TrumpLeaks #WeDontandWeWont
@NewDay @FoxNews  @GeorgeWill @Morning_Joe @greta what liars.Factcheck EVERYTHING #LOCKHIMUP #WomensMarchAtlanta #TheResistance
this country is not ready to see what @realDonaldTrump spends monthly on Spray Tan and Hair Spray. #fakenews  #ReleaseTheReturns
surprise surprise to who?? #donthecon has flip flop more and more and lies after lies come from that camp#draintheswampI'll wait
oh that promise was an alternative fact
@sheri_scary tell him we are not asking, now we're DEMANDING!!
Please deliver our message and tell those dick republicans wtfu!
@realDonaldTrump @PressSec Does the comment from @KellyannePolls that you will NEVER release #TaxReturns mean that you LIED?
@rolandsmartin #GaslighterInChief
@rolandsmartin Rules rewritten. 
I don't like it! Supporters don't care. Y wld u expect it. He is pres now. let's focus.
@Penny_G 
Technically, he didn't promise, since he never had any intention of releasing them.
just another broken promise.
Isn't he in violation of our constitution? Isn't there more you can do?
I did not vote for him, but I know many who did,  and they all expect trump to release his taxes.  Trump promised Americans that he would.
Wow, no wonder this country is in trouble. A sitting U.S. Senator that can't read and comprehend a simple statement.
You didn't actually BUHlieve him did you? 
#ManBoyWhoThinksHesAboveLaw
some would say a 'Hugely' broken promise..
Did any1 actually think Trump was going 2 release his Taxes?We need the DEMS in CONGRESS 2 GROW BACKBONES & FILIBUSTER EVERYTHING!
he needs to release these. To set this precedence is dangerous.
Whats he hiding? Russian assets?
@CarmelJudeobsc1 Because he now has the power of being a president. He thinks he doesn't have to.
@JeremyCShipp  I'm sure it won't be the last. Maybe that's not such a bad thing in some cases...
@Solar_Dancer @realDonaldTrump ...Wiki leaks said they'd get them...
I hope they find more legitimate info than they did on @HilaryClinton. I want fact not fiction!
Me too. But if I was Trump I'd be more worried about Amonymous...
It's no surprise to most of us...We don't have a president any more, we have a #presliar
I haven't seen the deleted emails yet.  Then I expect to see tax returns.  Who cares about returns anyway.
do something about it.
Alternative fact!
@JJohnson2u Him speaking by definition usually contains a broken promise every 30
Seconds.
My feeling is that this was obvious from the gate.  Time to get at the info a different way.
Time for lawyers!
I would bet the right doesn't give a hoot.
@DeereShopping They are controlling information.  This is not clear or transparent. Sorry some of the weak willed don't care
@DrDinD
Sadly, @realDonaldTrump has already broken a lot of promises @RonWyden  #DrainTheSwamp was a lie. Populist speech but took action on @FHAgov
@fangpusskins We must make him
@marieinal not suprised, the art of the deal and all..
Focus on what he does, not what he says. Fridays Exec order on ACA not good!
senator. Can we do a foiA request
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/immediately-release-donald-trumps-full-tax-returns-all-information-needed-verify-emoluments-clause-compliance … sign&RT official White House petition to release tax returns
@LoganLogan1989  Typical lie and or excuse from DT, he won on lies and is continuing to lie to the people!!!
I pray to GOD whom ever has knowledge comes forward!!!
Before Trump was "president"he was just a rich classless old man, with a horrible legacy to leave behind. Pres was vanity project
Trump knew his life was filled with conspiracy theories and Stern interviews. So he ran for Pres, to save face.
Don't forget; IRS issued statement; there was not ongoing audit.
You are part of the reason why people hate Washington.  So you really have nobody to blame but you for Trump in the White House.
what are YOU going to do about it? #TheResistance
please Mr. WYDEN Trump and Comey are treasonous traitors stop this fascism.

He broke promise because he's a fat palmed, small fingered twat! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ... Yes talkin bout U! #TheResistance
@sejorg Trump not trustworthy, neither are his cabinet, staff, Voters.
Come on man who would believe him in the first place he will never ever show anything to anybody he is 70 and gives as shit.
Please keep putting the pressure on @realDonaldTrump and his blatant lies. I might be a millennial, but I was taught not to lie.
another promise in a long string he will never keep.
@glynmoody Help Sen. Wyden get the other 41 co-sponsors on S. 26 to release presidential tax returns.
@CourtneySwans20 Drumpf is a lying pig. The only promise he will keep is to turn our country into a fascist country. #resist
If all else fails, Putin will release them eventually.
@EqualRightsMama why is anyone surprised? Ya know he's full of lies and broken promises? The story of the frog and the scorpion!
Obama made broken promises & lied throughout his 8 yrs as did all you Dems. Trump will work for all of us if you give him a chance
Not only broken promise but another lie.  He has said he was under audit, now Conway says he's not under audit. Lying Admin.
And,so...? Let's move on.
not Surprised. He says whatever he thinks people want to hear. No integrity. No intention of following thru. All about himself!
I hope the Senate Intelligence Committee will subpoena them as part of its Russia investigation.
@WajahatAli Who ever believed him?
this is not a broken promise.. These are alternative facts..
wyden what promises have you broken? Um for one where are the family paying jobs you said you bring to Oregon?
Dear Senator, ty. As a constituent I'm concerned our new POTUS may literally use position to pirate w/o disclosure & divestment.
at several (dozen?) broken promises per day, we are on track to be a despotic oligarchy by March.
@bjork55 Putin has his tax returns
#LyingDonald #ToxicTrump
When do you start impeachment proceedings over the emolument clause?
@reesworld1 Donald Trump could not care less about something he said.  He believes his supporters will forgive him anything.
Why so worried about 'his' taxes? Am sure Obama had the IRS 'investigating' him long ago looking for something.
@WajahatAli Proof positive he has something to hide.
@ScherLitNet Anybody that believed he would is a bona fide Sucker, come on man this is a car wreck without accountability
@adamshermanesq 
Can't trust a thing. Anything he says!!
Trump lies.  We have to call him out on it Every. Time.  It will get old.  We will get tired of it.  But it is our duty.
It's been a bald-faced lie, Ron. Call him to the carpet. He's hiding unconstitutional business dealings.
what abt legal talking heads "impeachable on day 1 of presidency" #promise. hope & disappointment from all sides.
I don't think Conway knows what "litigated" means. @mybookishways
I am loading the weapons in my house. The barbarians will indeed come to the gate. Not looking for a fight, but will be ready.
thank you from Oregon!!!
He also promised to release his tax returns if he became Pres
His taxes relate to the classified report concerning Russian interference don't they?

.@RonWyden Everything he says is a lie & broken promise. That's how he's made his fortune. #conman #WomensMarchOnWashington
No surprise, yet his followers do not care, even though the majority of we Americans do care!!
no one cares about his returns!
@BssDeRothschild His taxes would convict him of business connections with Exxon Mobil, collusion with Putin&Tillersn Rusky oil!
Because he distracts ppl with other petty things he does! SHOW TAXES @POTUS
Suprise,surprise,surprise! REALLY ?YOU WERE EXPECTING THEM? GET REAL! Quit trying to "normalize " this con-man/criminal
@ManMet80 kleptocrat @POTUS selling out USA interests to cover his foreign debts 2 russian mobsters & banks. He's a perveted crook
Trump is obviously afraid to release his tax returns 4 fear that they would make him look weak. #RussianDebt #BadLoans #Underwater
I've got a deal for you Ron- move 2New York &give up urSenate seat & we won't investigate ur wife'sfinancial dealings
:-( I didn't think he ever would.
@realDonaldTrump Trump is a small minded slimy liar!  #ShameOnTrump
To be honest I'm more worried about what Trump's about to blatantly loot than his existing property deals.
#LiarInChief in action
Trump's "broken promise" = another lie. Hoping we use strongest language. Thank you for your continued calling out!
Thank you Ron for fighting this fight for us! We see you! #proudtobeanoregonian
I'm from Oregon and Rodney done nothing to improve America
get it done wyden (with your colleagues), make him release them then!
Yawn...
Why can't we demand a mental health assessment???
Obstruct everything this clown does. Payback time. Keep your Democratic colleagues in line.
