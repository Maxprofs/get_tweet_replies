I think he should pay for my family vacation. After taxes,food a roof & lights we are pretty damn tapped.
I think you should pay back the taxes other Americans we’re forced to pay for educating YOUR children. Not our responsibility.
What are you talking about? She was talking about Tom Price who just stole taxpayer money. And was being sarcastic. Learn how to read.
Ouch! You know intolerance is not in fashion.
Huh? You don't make any sense.
Proving my point 
Blocking him
Read my mind.  I just did.   So ridiculous
He should pay it back, but I think it's not going to happen
No
I heard it's closer to $1 million but I hope our elected officials see to it that it's ALL paid back.
Seems Like We only Have Democrats and a Few Real Republicans that Have Honor, Integrity with Intelligence and Caring for USA and Americans!
Like Senator Ron Wyden Among Others. Thank You Senator Wyden for All You Do for Americans and for USA!
Talk about fleecing our government. How come no one talks about Hillary's uranium deal with the Russians?
No! Plz @RonWyden, collect every $ back for our treasury. I've paid my taxes faithfully for 40 years, and kleptocratic behavior sickens me.
Is there a way that Congress can make him pay it back? Sounds like another Wall Street scandal. Ripoff the taxpayers.
NO! Make the greedy bastard pay it back or go to jail. Stealing is stealing and against the law. Entitled greedy bastard.
U can say that about all of Trumps cabinet including Trump
No! His resignation is in ADDITION to repaying Americans the stolen money. @OfficeGovEthics @USAGSessions @POTUS @VP @GenJohnKelly @ACLU
Make him pay every penny back. Set an example !!
One word -  "Menendez"
Did he leave the check he promised?
Price will repay less than 10% of his abuse of taxpayers money. Arrogant republicans in action. Swampmaster Trump doesn't care
How did Ron Wyden accumulate a net worth of $40 million while serving in Congress for 
36 years?  21 in Senate & 15 in House
Isn't there a legal remedy? He stole taxpayer money.
Where did you accumulate your vast wealth Ron?
Why is it that stealing from the American people is somehow not against the law?
He should be in jail. I mean, didn't he just admit to perpetrating a fraud on America? #LockHimUp #ThrowAwayTheKey #MAGAMA!
I once knew a guy working for me (AAm) who was put in jail for steeling a can of tuna. He was poor & hungry. This guy, rich,100k’s? Nothing?
Right?It makes me furious.Our prisons are filled with people who commit petty crimes.Stealing services worth 100’s of thousands is NOT petty
Neither are you for for office! All U do is complain and belittle and fail to do Ur job puppet. Ur a DNC pawn with no useful discussion in U
Maybe you could check the stats on Lerner, Holder at al then get back to us.
No. Send a message loud and clear.
Name one non left person you think is fit for office - ever
He should be forced to pay and told Bankruptcy is not an option, same position #PuertoRico is confronted with.
He should not have done what he did. None of you should HAVE!! Who does this??  Crap, you have govt provided jets. 

#DrainTheSwamp
@Sherrishaw14 @SecPriceMD No...the answer is no!!
No! They've been told to feign ignorance, beg forgiveness.
Commercial Flights whatever, when yiurva Republican in the WH you can't draw flys
Price, Pruitt AND Mnuchin are all crooks& need to pay the taxpayers back in full & either tender their resignations or be fired. Pronto.
AND Zinke! Plus WaPo is reporting on Shulkin today: "VA chief took in Wimbledon, river cruise on European work trip"
Gov should withhold Price's pension until every penny spent on luxe travel is paid in full. He shouldn't be able to keep fleecing the public
Doubt Price will repay ANY of the private jet money now that he's been fired. @washingtonpost, will reporters follow-up on this, please?
Will U please urge House members to bring impeachment proceedings? Lichman's "The Case for Impeachment" book gifts to each perhaps? PLEASE?!
It is Customary For People Like This From The South.  They Usually Don't Get Caught Though.
That's rich coming from a man in the same party as Sen. Menendez, Anthony Wiener, Mayor Ed Murray...clean up your party and then talk.
Get rid of him and Zinke
YOU of all people are not fit for office Letting Clapper get away with lies about spying on Americans to Congress YOU are a filthy traitor
No! He can pay us back with his 'windfall' stock profits !
He needs to repay the entire amount or it comes out of the RNC fund, the Republicans happily confirmed him. #ImpeachTrump #nowars
Ha ha ha
We have to stop the greed that got us here.  https://stopgreednow.com/greed-economics-ceo-pay-versus-typical-worker/ …
Yeah, so much for draining the swamp
Next up is @SecretaryZinke .. another abuser of taxpayers dollars
What would stimulate #Price's trip out the door? I'll help with his baggage. You grab that $1,000,000 check from him as he passes by.
O no no
He ought to be prosecuted by the SEC for insider trading, and should be made to pay back the entire $1 million-plus he’s stolen.
How many trips you take back and forth to Oregon annually at taxpayer expense? To talk to your liberal base
#LockHimUp
And that can b said for this entire administration. They r all unfit
#AnotherSwampDweller Make him accountable! #NotOnMyDime
They are all about their #GoldenFleeceParachutes
Getting a lifetime pension & benefits for only being in office a short time is WRONG. It isn't deserved or earned. Grifters, all of them.
But you dont care about Senator Bob Menendez, sitting right next to you in the Senate, who is under indictment for stealing from Medicare.
Price should pay back every penny with a penalty and interest added.
Time to #FirePrice @RonWyden @UpNorth62 Dr Swamp @SecPriceMD Now using militaryfor International travel @realDonaldTrump ??#DrainTheSwamp
Um, many in #congress aren't fit for office. Maybe we should resolve that issue first
My husband is family practice MD. He agrees
Beyond time for him to go
Bet u thought oj was innocent too
#FireTomPrice Cabinet officers for Bill Clinton and GW Bush were fired for far less. Return $400K too. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
Congress need to take charge and pull the plug of the Swamp People.. That includes 45 as well
We need to Impeach Trump.  This man is very scary for our country.  Especially,  for the Elderly, Disable, Poor and Middle Class.
Scott Pruitt is also under investigation by IG for inappropriate flights to OK. What is it with lying liars who lie...
#makehimpay Paying $51k for $1m cost to taxpayers? Not enough! Pay profits from illegal trades & business deals.
Most members of @realDonaldTrump cabinet are unfit for office, as is Trump.
Really?
No way can he get by with  "he'll just pay for his seat on those private flights." He's not royalty!!!
no one is this entitled administration has the ethics to resign when they've been caught.
Price is NOT right for USA. Chief croc in the "swamp," @POTUS, leads in poor judgment: Bannon, Flynn, Sessions, Zinke, Mnunchin, who's next?
Pay back every penny and prosecute for stealing from USA.  If I robbed a bank, offered money back, I'd still go to jail, so should he.
The only ones fit are the Generals. Others are mostly unqualified  or unethical.
Ditto for @EPAScottPruitt
It appears that to be in this administration that you meet the prerequisite of being "Unfit for office".
Go get him, Senator Wyden. Price is unfit for the office of HHS.
Every $ over the price of a commercial ticket to those locations should come out of Mr Price's pocket.
He's not allowed. Lock. Him. Up.
He dr which make more fit for postion then you. We need dr in this postion the clown democrat put from what know where not drs. Stop with
partisan attack stick to protect the fourth amendment with senator rand paul which what you do best and stop lies on tax reform to get tired
He's an inside trader, hypocrite & a very corrupt liar. Up to a million $ of taxpayer $ from May to present! He owes more than cost of seat!
He made a fortune on insider trading as a MOC. How surprising is this?
So he's paying back 52,000$ of 1,000,000$ of taxpayer money he's spent. #DrainTheSwamp
Needs to pay it to a healthcare fund.
Any way we can get those funds directed to #2018Enrollment outreach?
He was a crook while in congress. Make him pay back all the $ he stole in his stock deals & in government perks
Call your MOC’s 202-224-3121 or send free faxes via #Resistbot by texting Resist to 50409. Demand Price’s resignation and reimbursement!
Why isn't he being indicted?
like obama
And you consider your self fit for office WOW
I wonder also?
How is it that he can steal from taxpayers, then say sorry, I'll pay it back? If I stole that kind of $ my ass would be in prison
My family thinks the same of you being in office.  Unfit
Why not? Bill and hellary did.....and u never objected .
You tell me?
Now look at this, another 500k in travel.
He needs to repay the taxpayers for his excess.
No
He needs to pay it back and then boot him out the door!!
Remind me how many vacations Obozo, with family, took to Hawaii on Air Force One.
He must repay the taxpayers
How does Price get to stiff us for  $350,000? He chartered a PLANE, not a SEAT! Entitled much?
to be honest I don't trust any of the establishment politicians..term limits
So what exactly did he do wrong? That he took a plane somewhere in accordance with his duties. Maybe he should of just deleted  some emails.
they need to resign.  they've already betrayed the public's trust
Well why not? It seems there are no checks and balances - easy to rob
@SecPriceMD is a con man just like @realDonaldTrump!
@realDonaldTrump I'd like to see the status of Price's effort to repeal O-Care rules written by Obama's HHS! Congress didn't write the rules
Why not...seems the MO for Trump Crime Family and Admin.
You have a lot of room to talk about ethics.
He must Pay up ALL $400,000 and resign. His behavior is totally unacceptable.
The only money taxpayers should contribute to Price is his room & board in federal prison!
#ThePriceIsWrong
#JetSetterPrice
#FirePrice 
#FirePrice 
#ReimburseTaxpayers
Lol u got the 280 characters @RonWyden use them wisely
Attach his wages.
NO he should pay the TOTAL $ back on his way out the door, or is @realDonaldTrump AFRAID of HIS Employee's? FIRE PRICE @HHSGov
LOCK HIM UP!
He's a shyster in a shyster government. We Oregonians appreciate your diligence in calling a duck a duck
No Cabinet member he picked is fit for office. Not a single one.
I'll quantify that @nikkihaley was before now.
Ron, they are acting like they didn't know this would be a problem.  Please.... Point I have is if they had poor judgement on something this obvious what other things are they doing to benefit themselves/friends etc.... on our dime.
OUT THE DOOR!
You should take the shortest possible route to get these guys in jail. Without haste, vigilante justice will become the only recourse left.
No he should not. Pruitt too.
HE IS NOT FIT FOR THAT POSITION AT ALL.  HE IS COMPLETELY UNFIT FOR HIS POSITION.  COMPLETELY.  GET HIM OUT OF THERE.
The entitlement issue
How many republicans voted against him again?
OH yeah...zero. Not even Collins. The guy straight up admitted he's an inside trader.
