It's not you I'm worried about. Just spent 45 minutes calling Republican senators. Stand tall!
Do I need to call you?
@SenatorIsakson doesn't clear his voicemail, so I can't even leave a message.
You're my senator. 
This is all so awful.
My senators oppose repeal of ACA because they actually stand w the people.

Thank you, @SenatorDurbin & @SenDuckworth.
Mine too Thank you @PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell

2018 #Obamacare Exchange Projections:
•40 counties w/ no carriers
•1,332 counties w/ 1 carrier
•27,660 enrollees without coverage…
Looooossssseeeerrrrr!
Which states are purging their voter rolls.  voters need to affirm their registration often to make sure they exercise their right to vote
Ya most of the ppl told them to vote yes.
My Senator is you Ron! Guessing I don't need to call you or Jeff! Keep up the good work!
You are my Senator. I think I'm covered. 
so important for folks to be able to continue to pay way too much for bad coverage with sky high deductibles.
Still call! The staff deserves our praise
You are my Senator.  I have no worries that you are on the right side of history and humanity.
It's 2:30 pm now you clown! When will you frauds posing as Sens + Reps start working for REAL PPL of America?? MAGA!! DJT 2020!!
I don't think I need to call you. I'm confident you'll vote correctly.
@Austin_Uebele I have but didn't send the message you probably wanted.  Peace
Yes and I ask them to #passthebill!
I'm confident which way you will vote, and I thank you in advance.
Fortunately my senators in Oregon are wonderful and are fighting for everyone's healthcare.  Thank you Senator Wyden!
I didn't need to my senator is you, and you are good at your job. Thank you senator Wyden.
I'm tweeting you instead. Thank you for standing up for the most vulnerable of us.
Stop obstruction. I'm sooo sorry I voted for you. Never will again. You DO NOT care about American people and it shows.
Yes I called. Repeal Obamacare.
You are my Senator sir and thank you for fighting for Oregon Health care. Repealing ACA will impact all with health insurance & medical jobs
As an Oregonian, I thank you.
Did you applaud the @GOP Senator that cast the deciding vote? The one living w/ cancer who voted to sentence other cancer victims to death?
I have not.
I have tweet thee and Sen. @SenJeffMerkley and Mitch @SenateMajLdr  to VOTE NO. Do not let the GOP kill innocent Americans.
I see you brought your disrespectful rabble to the gallery nice job Dems keep it up show America your true colors
You and @SenJeffMerkley  are my senators. I got your backs cuz you got my back on healthcare.
Your it !  Do I the right thing keep up the pressure Oregon ACA works.
Lucky me ! You are my Senator
I called you yesterday to say keep up the fight against this travesty and thank you for all you are doing.
My heartfelt thanks to you, Senator. Your hard work for all Americans is very much appreciated. #TrumpcareKills
Thank you & @SenJeffMerkley for fighting for us!
We have no ins.  In our 60's we pay individual mandate not seen Dr in over 12 yr - but support others getting coverage. So Thanks
I don't need to call YOU (or Merkley) - I KNOW you're on the right side!! 
I've called you and @SenJeffMerkley - wish there was more I could do.
@RonWyden and @SenJeffMerkley doing the right thing all the time really cramps my senator-calling activism.
You're my senator!  I appreciate your stand!
You are my senator sir! This is my call. I know you are doing the right thing. Thankful for your strong voice!!!!
Yes!!!
Thank you for standing for us Senator. It's an honor to have you representing us.
@yvonne_erdmann Yes. Corker emailed today; called & emailed Alexander yesterday.
Corker's phone line busy; will keep calling.
I'm am a DC resident. Apologies to the rest of the country. We cannot help you in this struggle
Not answering and voicemail box is FULL.. For the past week this has been going on. Twitter is a good way since they want to HIDE from WTP
Thanks for voting 'no'.
And in a "modern day presidential" fashion, I hounded my roommate to call as well.
Thank you for everything you're doing to defeat this!
My senators are you and Sen. Merkley, so I don't need to beg you to do the right thing 
I am so proud to be represented by hard working and ethical senators @RonWyden and @SenJeffMerkley. Thank you so much
Agree! I think they're killing themselves these days.  Maybe if things ever are sane again, they can rest a bit.
This is not President Trumps fault. You democrats cause all these problems. You have come to rely on illegals vote. Not Americans. Vote out
I know you fight the good fight and will do the right and moral thing. ..thank you for serving us here in Oregon!
Huge thanks to you & @SenJeffMerkley, my senators ... doing the right thing for Oregon and the rest of our country.
Call 844-432-0883 if you don't know your Senators number! They are voting at 2:15 today!
You are my Senator and I trust that you will vote no.
Thank you and @SenJeffMerkley for representing us with compassion and conviction. Fight the good fight. We've got your backs!
Called @SenCoryGardner who is only accepting VM and shared my concerns. But I have ZERO confidence in my own Sen. He's complicit. How sad.
Sure have and continue! Thanks!
Yes I called you and you told me you didn't care what I think. You democrats did this to American people. Too big to read. Remember.
YOU
WILL 
BE
DEFEATED

(End transmission)
Yes and .@SenDeanHeller office does not answer phone in either Las Vegas nor DC. I have tweeted several messages directly.
I retweeting, but live in DC and don't have a Senator -- much less two -- to contact!
DC residents don't have senators...  Can you guys get us some?
You're my senator. Go get em
I just can't understand voting on something you haven't even read. Just for a political win.
One of the best parts about living in Oregon is having two sane senators. Keep up the good fight. @SenJeffMerkley ty for your hard work too
I wish it would have mattered, but my senators are @ChuckGrassley and @joniernst and they aren't brave enough to vote country over party. 
Still call. Let your voice be heard!
You're my senator. Unfortunately calling you is a waste of time cause you're nothing more than a partisan hack. #FullRepeal
Reconciliation allows for unlimited amendments just give them 2 years worth run the clock out on them.
I have been calling for weeks. Everyday. Sometimes twice. A yes vote for Trumpcare should be a no vote for them at the polls.
#FullRepeal
you are my senator
I would if I could but I'm (although ex Oregonian:-) not a US citizen. Good luck today!
You are my senator -- I know you will do the right thing. And I'm grateful for that. Thanks for all you do.
you get Rubio to go against the GOP agenda. Ive tried.
Since you're mine, can you go poke a few others with a stick on my behalf?  #saveACA Please?  
You're my senator and I know how you and @SenJeffMerkley are voting...thank you!
Called every family member in Ohio to encourage them to call Sens Portman and Brown, and Gov. Kasich.
FYI: Im Now delaying A1C test cos +ve result=diabetes=uninsurable

Dont want 2 lose Ins against  catastrophe due to diabetes diagnosis
No answer at your office.  Let Obozocare die and watch people suffer. @OregonGovBrown would go ape not knowing what to do.
Your my senator. Please log my nononononono
Thankful my Senators are good people who think of US citizens & will vote against this horrible bill! Wish others were of good conscience!
Thank you for your hard work on this, and please keep working to expand healthcare. No one should suffer from lack of insurance.
I'd call your office but that would be a waste of time. Calling GOP offices instead. Thanks for all you do for Oregon!
You are my Senator; would you like a call? :) Go get 'em!
Ditto #KillTheBill #SaveOurCare #DoctorsSpeakOut
Made this spreadsheet w/ local office #s of house/senate to use if D.C. voicemail or lines are busy. CALL LOCAL!!!
