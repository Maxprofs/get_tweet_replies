ThankYou Senator @RonWyden for pinpointing the #TrumpRussia connection! Except our final word should be "WRONG...!" to #ExxonKnew #Tillerson
Apparently this was the big fish in the Tillerson to Sec of State deal;  Putin/Tillerson/Trump
#seemslegit
What are friends for?
I believe this is everything the election was about.
Snakes!!!!
We are watching! #canthidefromthetruth
Thank you Sen Wyden.  Exxon asking to waive Russian sanctions is a SCANDAL.
This smells "swampy"
This would be a great opportunity for the Secretary of Corruption to decline the waiver and show Trump admin isn't a swamp...HAHAHAHAHA!
This is why the government shouldn't be run like a business
He can ask all he wants The CEO is just looking out for his company If Tillerson actually does it because the CEO asked him that's a problem
 Shocking!
Disgusting--Maxine Waters called it. The only reason for Tillerson is to let Russia pollute Mother Earth! Celebrate earth day!

!Call, Email, Fax! TREASURY DEPM'T Foreign Asset Control to say #NoExxonWaiver During #TrumpRussia Investigation !! https://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx … https://twitter.com/IrishMason/status/855029292916461568 …
This seems like a Hail Mary before shit hits the fan. Ask for full disclosure of 19% sale of Rosneft - the true owners & Trump's commission
Before Admin waives sanctions,  force POTUS to view photos Ukranians murdered by Putin's orders. Admin must stand for democracy. Investigate
Jobs and more jobs at least someone gets it. That pizza you buy while occupied in a fed building needs tax dollars to support your agenda
This should be an obvious GIANT red flag!
So little foreplay from these guys.
Good god
Oh hell no Ron
What is that peninsula to the adjacent north of the oil field? #crimea

Hmm. Is this quid pro quo for Russia's tampering with our election?   And reason Tillerson is Secret of State? #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Can you call for impeachment proceedings yet? #ImpeachTrumpNow #UnfitToServe #UpholdYourOath
I thought Tillerson had to divest, did this ever actually happen, or he did but his wife and kids still have stock in Exxon?
Sickening. So proud to live in 97215 & have you fighting the fight. #resist
No surprise.
Follow the money. We are living in strange times. Thank you for being one of the good guys, Senator.
"Remember who put that $180 million in your pocket"
Is this what the election rigging was about?
Hey Republicans if you're not outraged by this blatant trickery, burn your flags and sell your white pickups.
uh Sen Wyden...ex-CEO of XOM is SecState not SecTreas...and has recused himself from any lobbying
Better lift the sanctions senator or Vlad will release the golden showers video. You don't want the whole country getting sick, do you?

Putin is rearing his head...
No puppet. No puppet here. Look away.
That waiver just can't happen!
Criminal!
This has been the plan from the beginning. What is the Congress going to do to stop this? No reduction in sanctions 'til investigations done
If course!
Are you seriously implying that the Republicans wouldn't approve it?  If so, you haven't been watching closely over the last 3 months...
They don't even wait until the 100th day.
Stay strong on sanctions! Bullies can't be allowed to win!!
Please Senator I beg you and @SenJeffMerkley to put your all into this
I hope you are on this issue, Ron!!! This is BS!!
Nothing to see here.
Right. 
Reeks of all kinds of conflicts of interest! Guess the plan is coming together for them! This is unreal!
Senator Wyden this transparent deal making is driving us citizens crazy.
There should be more sanctions put on Russia.  In fact we shouldn't have anything to do with them till Putin is out of office.
What's wrong with this picture?
Everything
Please fight this @RonWyden thank you
The FBI was never allowed to investigate that server to determine who hacked it, if it even was hacked. Obama DHS was hacking election.
Russian sanctions over fack Russia election scandal.  You have no provable facts, except from the firm paid by the DNC that said it was them
That was Trump's plan all along. Isn't this illegal? The obvious collusion? Is there nothing we can do? Trump is a TRAITOR in every way
Hillary signed off on 20% of US uranium for millions in donations to her Foundation and speaking fees for Bill. Were is the outrage on this!
This is fake enough to get on FOXNews !
Really, still at it. What about Obama telling Russians "He has more flexability in his last term" some thing like that.
@OccupyDemocrat1 Ethics violation pile up. Firm a funeral pyre for trump admin. One heck of a bonfire
Can you and colleagues do anything to stop this? This is so wrong!
1) Can you make sure this doesn't happen?
2) If not, how do we stop it?!
Knew this was coming. This administration is as crooked as the day is long.
Only not a problem in this corrupt administration.  Who convinced Trump to hire the worst SOS ever in the first place?
This is so wrong on so many levels.
and i wonder what he'll say.
Omg.
This administration has no ethics whatsoever. Predictable but still sad.
NO
Thank you for your service Senator Wyden.
Surprise surprise.  Those crooked treasonous basta*rds.
Time 4 bipartisan report! @SenJohnMcCain thinks they r crazy... per post today. Time 4 people 2 go down... NOW!!! #Trumprussia #Impeach
Lift 
Let Oil flow
Who benefits 
WH Advisor Schwarzman & Pal
Trump
Have Rosneft Oil
Deal 5 yrs 220,000B day $3 markup
Oh, the criminality
Biggest scandal in American history. I hope they have evidence or trace the money. Sold out the U.S.A. for that oil pay! Greed is obscene.
It's more than greed. Attempt take Govt
Putin puppet 
Oil kills World
As Plutocrats eat, drink and
Take from little ppl
Plus get t votes
Here it comes...
Just no. Thank you.
I guess sanctions only apply to everyone who hasn't put a trillion dollars on the table
I wonder how that's going to turn out
Story of what happened to KGB Officer Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with Polonium in 2006 #Putin

Senator, what can we do to stop this? Admin has the oowe5 or does Senate have a say? #resist #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Go get'm Ron!!!
Senator, any sense your colleagues have the will to address issues w Trump Admin.? From out here I see no action wrt corruption, etc.
Surely, just ANOTHER coincidence, right?
#TrumpRussiaCollusion
Do laws matter anymore? Can I break them also without any penalties?
This should disqualify him immediately. He should step aside. This entire administration is #wrong
JESUS! What is wrong with these people?
Future swamp asks current swamp...
So Rex can only have an eye contact with Putin..
I'm a conservative Republican to the core. But, he better not.
Sad to say it, but we saw this coming from the possibly inhabitable moon of Saturn.
ROFLMAO
Please pursue this, Senator, with the utmost zeal.
And so it continues
why can't something be done about this obvious conflict of interest and ethics violation?
ABSOLUTELY NO TO THIS!!We need to focus on #TrumpRussia and get that traitor out of the White House. We can tolerate no more corruption.
We need to impose more sanctions on Russia because of their interference in our election. We absolutely shouldn't lift or grant exceptions.
Hmm.  Wonder what Rex and Putin talked about last week.  Bet there's no connection at all ....
Tillerson has recuse himself & you know that already.
Pushback, pushback, pushback!!!!
Jaw. Drops.
It's either that or they will start another war, Ron. You know as well as I do, the big oil men always get what they want.
Go get him Ron. Please don't quit digging and make them pay.
#ComradeRexxon
Not even trying to hide the corruption
