@repjohnlewis @vitaladvocacy / I can only imagine what the said about him. It was a pleasure to meet him the last time he was in Dallas .
@johnsonwillisj @repjohnlewis #cointelpro ... a too little known travesty in #American #history. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO 
@repjohnlewis @MAHAMOSA  speak of Iranians wonder whether a black prez is hypnotized into ignoring Israel's crimes like white presidents?
@repjohnlewis do we actually have a choice? I doubt it!
@repjohnlewis @mch7576 Ah-men, fr yr lips to McConnell -Boehner & boys' Ears. 'Getting' "security" by Losing Rts = Not Boston -Anywhere USA
@repjohnlewis @Can_ada "Reading the FBI file on SCLC & myself, I am more convinced than ever that we cannot allow government surveillance."
what a difference a year makes huh?
@repjohnlewis @truthglow i am so glad you have outlived so many of these dolts
@repjohnlewis @deray #ENDMASSSURVEILLANCE
@repjohnlewis Surveillance was pre-assassination #ActofState against #MLK. Now metadata used in drone assassinations
@repjohnlewis @luckylindy31 - Agreed. It's not a 'slippery slope.' It's wrong in America.
@repjohnlewis why r u not surprised at wot u r seeing in your file? Xx
@repjohnlewis @JLownLaw I support NSA as long as there is a BARACK OBAMA's Presidency! More death threats than history of Presidency /racism
@repjohnlewis Shocking
@repjohnlewis @Jonijam Did they have records of you collusion with IRS?
@repjohnlewis @EvanWoodson But IRS targeting conservatives to win elections & Hillary illegally using private server&destroying emails is ok
@repjohnlewis Well, if you disappear tomorrow at least 5,000+ of us will know to ask questions
@repjohnlewis @theracetraitor Yes, the surveillance against #MLK was a run up to his assassination by #AnActofState
@repjohnlewis @MAHAMOSA “Government #Surveillance” can quickly become ideological. The problem is #LackOfOversight, #Racism & #AbuseOfPower.
@repjohnlewis @doctorjoe56 Surveillance has become a necessity specially aft 9/11/ in ur days enemy was COMMUNISM . now Terrorism @mahramm
@repjohnlewis @deray I'm not sure but will listen to the wisdom of @repjohnlewis
@repjohnlewis @doctorjoe56 I cannot  imagine Gov giving up surveillance now .If We expect SECURITY , they have to do  SURVEILLANCE/ @mahramm
@repjohnlewis @doctorjoe56 Thank you!  Control is the means and the end to suppression and slavery.
@repjohnlewis @dnewmaThis is a highly debated topic
@repjohnlewis WOW
@repjohnlewis @Jeffsnation i tried to explaining this to @Jeffsnation,  body camera's will create an obidient society #MichelFoucault
@repjohnlewis first of all let's not pretend that You didn't know what was going on, if you didn't then we need to replace you. Simple!
@repjohnlewis True Indeed Sir!!!  Peace
@repjohnlewis @BenJealous please end the madness, it was unnecessary to begin with. just like the camps 4 Japanese Americans in WW2
@repjohnlewis @agski48 John - what we must do is concvince the Justice Department to indict Dick Cheney
@repjohnlewis I suspected as much and deeply appreciate your never ending willingness to speak the truth. You are one of our true heroes.
@repjohnlewis @DebdebWilder 
It must be jarring 2C the reports with U as the subject matter. It makes U a perfect person to fight for this.
@repjohnlewis So do you take back this statement you made where you condemned Edward Snowden? http://johnlewis.house.gov/press-release/rep-john-lewis-no-praise-snowden …
@repjohnlewis @JefferyMullins Then why did you condemn Edward Snowden for exposing the government's surveillance program?
@JimB_85 @repjohnlewis Guess his views about surveillance changed after reading what the FBI had on him. Time to support #Snowden Mr. Lewis!
@repjohnlewis it tok this long 2 convince u, @ggreenwald has ben rprtng on it 4 yrs. Reality only sinks in wen newz hits home. #hippocracy
@repjohnlewis tea partiers, the best chance to restore true liberty & justice for all, are openly labeled as terrorists, in their own House
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald I couldn't agree more, but how do we get the genie back in the bottle?
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald ..........Obama should step down. He has committed to the surveillance state and it is wrong, morally and legally
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald But, the terrorists! ISIS!! Al-Qaeda!!! Iran!!!!  9/11, the terrorists, 9/11, the Taliban, Syria, ISIS!!!!!!!!!
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald So you are going to codify it in the so called reform package called the USA Freedom Act?  We aren't stupid.
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald When one becomes aware...one becomes offended #BLACKPRIDEMATTERS
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald Gov't surveillance is the NSA, if you're worried about investigation disband the FBI. Or shrink their activity.
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald of anyone, for any purpose? No audio of drug deals, etc.?
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald  If they have it, they'll use it wherever convenient.
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald 1. You should have known about this 2. What is the CBC going 2 do 3. Will U confront Obama the enabler of fascists
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald so vote Rand Paul?
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald Surveillance of civil rights leaders was the first connection I made when I found out about NSA surveillance.
@repjohnlewis @ggreenwald dont forget us non citizens, we are people to.
@repjohnlewis @BRANDdonator amazing isn't it...that horse is gone though
@repjohnlewis Amen brother!  There are (many) areas of 'politics' and good governance where the left & right can agree!
@repjohnlewis @neeratanden Was a very,very different era.Now, there are real, unequivocal terrorists groups that need close surveillance.
@repjohnlewis @kxlblockade then sunset the patriot act and restore the 4th Amendment!
@repjohnlewis The American people are no longer in charge of their government. The sooner we acknowledge this, the sooner it can be fixed.
@repjohnlewis @WeTheCorpsUSA what took so long to figure it out?
@repjohnlewis 1997 uproar over Carnivore-told to shut it down. AG Reno said, out loud, "Let's just change the name" & so it ran on unimpeded
@repjohnlewis @uniqueloves Is the govt going 2 stop the intrusive illegal audio/video surveillance n Dennys, Family & $ General n Blk areas?
@repjohnlewis @datagoodies He will be remembered forever in history while talk show hosts will rise and fall with ratings
@repjohnlewis #FBISurveillance Well, I don't have anything to hide. 
Shocking, just shocking isn't it?@repjohnlewis @KatMcKinley
@repjohnlewis @GlobalRevLive as they say god is watching you too
but so too is Israel the embodiment of satan abusing/blackmailing you
@repjohnlewis @GlobalRevLive that's why we need to know that those in the know know some are watching those alone who are allowed to know
@repjohnlewis @KeeganNYC I'm convinced we can't stop government surveillance. They will continue as usual. It goes too deep.
@repjohnlewis  Shorter: Damn, these folks dug up some shit on me.  Who's palm I gotta grease?  @dangainor
@repjohnlewis @OccupyWallStNYC
@repjohnlewis Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/repjohnlewis/status/599209490983059456 … (Ranked 1st for May 15.)
@repjohnlewis wait a min... You needed an FBI file to tell you that the govt spying on We The People is wrong?
Years ago, many probably considered @repjohnlewis, a great man, to be an agitator. Sometimes meaningful change requires stirring the pot.
@repjohnlewis only because you dont want them watching you and your criminal activity
@repjohnlewis @rasjbaraka this is prophetic are the concept more than a notion #eyes/ears everywhere
@repjohnlewis @AliceDreger We'll get it in the UK regardless, apparently, under law dubbed the "snoopers' charter". Magna Carta 1215? RIP.
@LouMinoti lol, wtf in his defense tho they hit him real hard on that bridge
.@repjohnlewis Panthers did some shouting too, but message was not clearly heard.  Formal nonviolence is hard, teach it. It's not for wimps.
.@repjohnlewis The SCLC/NAACP were the voices my gen heard shout "Black lives matter!" #nonviolence works. Hard to believe, but better 2day.
@repjohnlewis Withdraw consent from systems that promote psychopaths to power.

How to #Withdraw #Consent
http://tapyoureit.boards.net/thread/37/withdraw-consent …
.
@repjohnlewis wait, THAT was your first clue? You are right, but the police state is set up my man, what are you going to do about that?
.@repjohnlewis My dad worked night security on Salem/Montgomery, sir, and I went on to help found @torproject.  That's SCLC heritage.
@repjohnlewis did you vote for the patriot act? Doesn't that disregard  the 4th amendment of the constitution of America?
@repjohnlewis @NeoProgressive1 This guy has the School of Americas in his district, and NOW he's convinced?1
@repjohnlewis @pmarca - tell us more sir, although I am sure you knew this before now!
@repjohnlewis Love you John Lewis!
@repjohnlewis @fightfortheftr Government surveillance is a sad fact.1 that reminds of old @libertyhq campaign 'who watches the watchmen'
@repjohnlewis @LOLGOP This an historic photograph. Powerful.
@repjohnlewis The USA recognized my father's passing in 2006 via the CIA daily log note to stop monitoring him. Which started in the 1950s.
@repjohnlewis @fightfortheftr They must have something on ya
Would @repjohnlewis care to expand on that...?
@repjohnlewis @GrimesHoldings amen to that brother, amen
@repjohnlewis @pmarca Take it from someone who knows.
@repjohnlewis @pmarca does the fact that Google and a myriad of tracking companies disturb you as much?
.@haikufunk @repjohnlewis @pmarca The Intelligence Community uses big data co.s to requisition data they are not allowed to gather as govt
FYI If you don't know @repjohnlewis, then you know nothing about SC nor US Civil Rights movement.
@repjohnlewis @TheMeemTeam surveil, 'observe', spy on & monitor ppl no matter what laws r enacted. Its how the Top stays on top.
@repjohnlewis @TheMeemTeam part of the caveat of gov't surveillance is there's no permission asked. & certain entities in this country will
@repjohnlewis @ACLU I agree.
@repjohnlewis @WhiteHouse  @GottaLaff We should rid J Edgar Hoover name from all Federal Buildings. Cointelpro was the game #rightthewrong
@repjohnlewis @GottaLaff :STILL beats CORPORATE SURVEILLANCE. Even BETTER would be NONE AT ALL.
@repjohnlewis Ike warned the mil-sec-intel industry would own us. Master gets paid the same if killing is here at home. We need a 3rd party.
@repjohnlewis God positioning U in Congress is not happenstance! Congressional oversight is needed 2 reveal corrupt behavior in govt.!
Authority. MT “@repjohnlewis: Reading FBI file on SCLC & myself, I am convinced we cannot allow govt surveillance. ”
@repjohnlewis On October 10th, we *will fulfill the aim of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. http://millionsforjustice.org   #JusticeOrElse
.@repjohnlewis Agree. You've lived it - govt abuse is not theoretical. It's a complete violation of the 4th Amendment.
@repjohnlewis Is this something the @GAOChfScientist should investigate?  Is it in their purview?
@repjohnlewis Amen John, if it can be abused, it will be abused, welcome to human nature.
@repjohnlewis @VanJones68 FIX IN: HRC V JEB & IRAN WAR FALL 2018 EITHER WAY. IKE WARNED WE'D BE OWNED BY MILITARY/SECURITY/WAR INDUSTRY!
@repjohnlewis What detail or observation in the file surprised or shocked you most?
