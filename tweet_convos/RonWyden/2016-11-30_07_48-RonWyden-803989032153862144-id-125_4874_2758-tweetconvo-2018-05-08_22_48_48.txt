Heading to the floor to give Congress one last chance to stop or delay mass government hacking. Watch: http://www.senate.gov/floor/  #Rule41
@Amyloukingery Go to Rule 41 on your search bar. It will bring up Scope & Seizure!
So you're ok with these lunatic Muslim terrorists running people over and hacking them up over& over again?!! Resign.
Those who would give up Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor safety.
Those who will not fight to defend liberty from cowardly Muslim terrorists shouldn't have it!!!!!
our liberties are being Stripped Away in the name of patriotism we will be Patriots with no rights
Got it backward again just-a-bunch-a-mush; Patriots give you liberty not the other way around!!

I can't imagine the horror which awaits the massive amount of people using Government against the peoples will.
how is this even possible? So America is no longer a democracy, but run by a dictator?
we haven't been a democracy in many years, we've just been lied to by Hippocrates. those lies are being noticed now
I am just realizing this now. I feel like I have just awoke from a fog and I want to know how we can fix it
revolution is the fix
Remind me again who's president?
@Snowden When will people learn that mass surveillance is a poor substitute for good old fashioned police work?
ah but it's great for policing citizens who might say things you don't like in private.  That pesky free speech.
Since when does the FBI make laws? Is it constitutional for them to do this? How?
@TheMeemStreams @RonWyden The Kardashian reality show of politics has made it anyone's game. Question is, who is in charge.
@InsideTAMU FBI will prosecute John Jane Doe, not HRC
...better yet, put yourself and your family between these nuts and the rest of society, ...or SHUT UP!
@Snowden just like germany. Taking things slowly away . It's called conditioning. Time to suit up Americans . Shits getting real.
it's been real. Since 2008,Obama& MuslimBrohood in the WH
this is pre obama. Much bigger picture to see.  Water and food=next war. World crops cannot feed humans
@avanconia @2Alpha @ConstanceQueen8 @Conservatexian @HoustonWelder #PatriotsNation #Bikers4Trump #Oathkeepers #ThinBlueLine 
YES!!
great! I cant wait to be hacked
Didn't think for one second they are looking 4 U or Me.
if IRS goes after citizens, so does FBI, etc
what do we do to stop it Ron?
I would like to know that, too.
Hey all! Contact Congress and make your voices heard here! http://www.decidethefuture.org  @fightfortheftr
@Amyloukingery @kneeddough @ZAmandalee @RonWyden @fightfortheftr they'd b really really bored w mine
Would you be OK with the authorities searching your home at any time without your knowledge? It’s unconstitutional.
I also think if you woke up at 3 AM to a bunch of cops going through your house, you would freak out.
so long as you continue in non-divergent patterns, you'll continue to fail and self-destruct. I'm here when you are ready.
Until there's a better solution, I don't mind giving up a few freedoms for my & family's safety.
How do I find out more about this/what of my privacies I now need to be weary of?
@nobelpatriot ugh #rule41 why won't the FBI enforce #Rule34
Just to be clear, #Rule41 allows government to get any "Po-Dunk" Judge to approve warrant and FBI allowed to hack ANYONE ANYWHERE.
Illusion of security =/= Freedom. Ill take freedom above all. History tells us, Freedom lost isn't regained w out bloodshed.
Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.
Merci de votre écoute  désolé pour le son
This will NOT be good. Need to stand up for our right for personal privacy.
a l
well... I guess we will find out how many Anthony Weiners are in the FBI...
thanks for being someone who believes in informed citizens. #newcoldwar #spyvsspy

This is Obama's FBI doing this. If only you told Pizza Pelosi to F off and actually take care of Bush Jr corruption. Thanks Wyden.
You're one of the good guys, but craven, supine Congress ( + Democratic Party, for that matter) had no interest in debate. #Rule41
welcome to GB's world - we're already there #1984 #2016now
Aye, that's what I was thinking. :(
what action(s) are you taking?
one more obama executive order
@Prd2bnAmerican maybe Snowden can retweet this in 5 yrs as a "discovery"
That will create a single point of failure for civilization. Whoever hacks FBI has the power of the FBI.
Hack Back!
#TheEmpireIsCrumbling at the hands of their political, corporate & military leaders. Greed & immorality capitulate its destruction
listened to Michael Hayden speak yesterday. He literally called the 4th amendment "a problem"
@StopTheCrazies1 Ohhhh noooo, they will see all my cats naked! Invasion of privacy!
I hope @realDonaldTrump takes a hard look at this when he swears in next month.
smh
You need to start backing moderate Republicans into corners and asking them if they still believe in their oath of office.
@HoustonWelder feds already have jurisdiction Ron. Its called judicial economy. When do you retire?
you HAD to spoil our fun, eh.
Lol nah I encourage all the fun you can have with the libtards
@SmythRadio Ron Wyden is as worthless as Ben Sasse, although for different reasons
Welcome to the police state. The terrorists have won.
@kurt_nimmo kinda illegal..
Like any of their debating would have had a positive outcome for the citizens. They are just a rubber stamp for the rich
@BeautyBind It begins....
and in oregon the will introduce another gun bill with a vote from the people.
@Twitlertwit Well ain't it strange how "1984" has arrived now.
and now in the UK too under the #IPBill
Stop paying them. That usually does the trick.
The Government has no authority to do this especially to literally cost people they are trying to hack $/time.
You do realize that this is both Unconstitutional & actually causes people to have to pay to try & fix or protect their computers.
And Americans are helpless.
didn't we elect you to fix stuff like this?  I have been voting for you for years. This is on your watch.  Fix it.
. @RonWyden when is US law enforcement going 2 reveal how they use #surveillancestate technology for  deliberate harm? it's about time #AMDG
@justinamash b/c of BHO, or u gonna blame DJT again?
this stuff MUST stop, especially NOW. Also, no Jeff Sessions, no racists, etc. SAVE US! Palin for VA? Holy Crap GOD PLEASE save us
We truly appreciate your efforts on behalf of the American people. You did what you could. Thank you.
How did you let this happen??
It took @FBI 3 years to get into @HillaryClinton's email server.So... forgive me if I'm not shaking. #sarcasm @Snowden @wikileaks
So, this can be considerered taxation without representation, right? Who being taxed  would be in favor of this?! WHO???
-- Great to hear that the government is getting more efficient. Everyone knows congressional "debates" = posturing.
@sunneversets100 my email computer post on twitter my desk in my office and home are open to any search if that will keep us safe
Should've been you against Trump.
I wonder when the rest of the politicians will remember that thing called the Constitution and peoples rights #privacy #invasion @RonWyden
the only thing they know about is constipation and slave doctrine
.@RonWyden Yawn.
thanks for contributing something of value.
If what you are saying is true, sounds logical to me. Would make it easier to get the job done.
@davemorin  How can you stop it?
@bad_bad_bernie and the best,you can do about this is a tweet?

Heading to the floor to give Congress one last chance to stop or delay mass government hacking. Watch: http://www.senate.gov/floor/  #Rule41
@Snowden The tweet is no longer available to retweet. It's troubling that twitter would remove it. Can someone make them?
where in gods name is this word heading
the govt is out of control.
.@RonWyden thank you for fighting for privacy! Government should look  .@alex_pentland & .@GuyZys #privacy #blockchain tech from .@medialab
While we were distracted... :(
I vehemently disagreed with your TPP efforts but hopefully now your voice will be useful when Trump tries to expand these programs
This government doesn't represent us.  It rules us with total impunity.
now if you could get them to speak the same truth instead of lying about it there would be revolutionary war 2.
@YourAnonNews at least you tried to do something. Where the hell are all the supposed freedom lovers in congress?they are #weaktea
ppl in congress want to be rulers instead of representatives. That is the problem in a nutshell.
@YourAnonNews you have already shown you don't really care about the people of your state Vets and seniors need the pay increases
Thanks for your efforts to prevent this. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
@YourAnonNews more fuel for West Coast secession #calexit #cascadia
who served the authoritarian state on a platter to the authoritarian? #bush #obama #clinton
#OneLove
@Snowden the American media and left won't care until they realize those powers will soon be under Trump administration.  Too late
@catoletters We're still pissed off about section 215. Have you done Anything yet? Stop w/ the 15hr min wage BS & justify the BOR
@Snowden and ppl were worried about this happening after new POTUS Trump taking over the reigns of power..
do you disagree with the assessment of the Assistant AG?
@Snowden why didn't a federal judge rule this unconstitutional? Or illegal? #justsaying
reliable deets plz
is one of the good ones!
Congress really only debates on how much money they should receive for selling our fake freedoms anyway.
@Snowden One word, Stuxnet.
uk just told us they're going full Orwell...China just announced same..track everything but spin like it's good for the ppl.  nope
Thanks a lot, Obama. @RonWyden @Snowden
This from the guy that voted for fast track on TPP.
@snowden @fbi look into it
...why? Why is this allowed?

Federal Bureau of Idiots and the congressional morons. Now those are whats ruining thin country.
@GrainOfSands Fantfuckingtastic 
@RedwoodGirl Like they could be bothered.
@csoghoian Sorry, but all 3 of my Congress-critters are for it. Feinstein wants to go even further.
https://boingboing.net/2016/11/29/projecting-leaked-nsa-docs-on.html …  A take a look at the dark side having the light of truth cast upon their lair.
Negotiate more search power for gov't in exchange for new privacy rights online & stop corporations from tracking.
@realDonaldTrump Jail for flag burning? Then we need to jail anyone else who blatantly violates our Constitutional rights. #Rule41
why?
Thank you for trying Ron!
