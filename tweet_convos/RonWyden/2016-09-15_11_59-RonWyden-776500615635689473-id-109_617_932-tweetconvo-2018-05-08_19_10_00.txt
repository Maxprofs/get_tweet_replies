Would you (or have you) askedTrump for the IRS audit letter. @Lawrence has driven home, it may not exist, i.e. no audit. #NBC
If you were a real person, i might reply with something but since you are not.....
@Ireland0828 Donald the Chump should be ordered 2 release his taxes!!!

this can't be true because on @Morning_Joe, @MichaelSteele said that there are no polls showing Americans care about Trump taxes
@upwithmike 
This partial return from 2011 explains why he will not. Way too much cheating & lies
They look great!!!! What's the problem?
@gjlos24 So where's your daily reporting demanding he release them? All day everyday you all bashing HRC about transparency
but they said there were no polls aski..... #SayAnything
Doesn't matter. Percentage of Trump supporters who will change their vote due to lack of tax return release is 0%
@WhitfordBradley Completely agree. Also thanks for sharing tweets. Awesome.
Simple question to get a simple answer @Lawrence
Katy..Someone needs to ask Trump to Release his IRS Audit Inquiry Letter, to PROVE that he's even being audited. He isn't.
@LeftDial Thank you for putting pressure on Trump he needs to show us his tax....NOW, Fantastic Reporting
tell him to act like a man and release his tax returns.  Vito Coreleone: YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN!
since he is obsessed with polls, perhaps someone should point this one out to him....oh...right..this one "rigged "
What do you say to that @KellyannePolls ?
that medical report on Oz today was that also released to press and posted anywhere? I smell a rat.
and his actual health records. No way his BP 116/70 unless he took medicine to lower before tests. He's too big & old for that.
#ReleaseYourTaxes
please don't vote for Trump, and don't waste it on 3rd party candidates who don't know what "Aleppo" is. Vote for Hillary.
how do you when Donald Trump is lying? ans...when his mouth is moving.
@Gigitrog No Taxes!  No Presidentcy!
.   Everyone Tweet @realDonaldTrump and tell him to release his tax returns!
no one cares
No Least of our concerns. Our country & world are facing very serious problems; these issues, DNC & Clinton corruption more imp
Paul Ryan was in the media today stating he believes Trump should release his taxes....did I hear a slap from the GOP?
hahaha liberal journalists are out in full force trying to take the attention off of #SickHillary - Katy, be better than this.
Of course, whatever the returns show, you & your ilk'll find something sinister about it. I want competent gov't not tax returns
Who did you poll all Democrats?
and he and his surrogates day the voters don't care. B.S.
@MichaelSteele You asked to show you a poll that says the people want to see Trump's taxes. Here you go Michael
@angelakissesu I hope the other 25 don't care because they wouldn't vote for him anyway
but they'll for him anyway
He has decided that not releasing them will hurt his campaign less than releasing them will. That should tell you something.
don't understand blind trust- he already knows how monetary policies affect foreign courses and resorts. So he can't be blind.
@BenjySarlin Hey @KellyannePolls what say you? Another lie maybe?
Just this am someone on @Morning_Joe made the comment that polls show no one is interested. I thought that didn't sound right.
Yet 74% think this is their least important issue. Nothing but a distraction no one really cares
You need to ask to see his Audit Letter...there isn't one! Trump will never release his Taxes...they will destroy him!
the more important question, what % of those 75% sy his failure to do so will impact their vote. My guess is < 10%
He is undoubtedly hiding something but please hammer away on him for those returns.
But will they vote for him regardless? That's really all that matters.
.@KatyTurNBC "So it's not just the media? Who knew?" -Trump (in my imagination lol)
media pundits say they don't. Just ignore polls and tell the lie. Continue to not demand. R they lazy or want him to get pass
@csurgtech You found them!! OK: so she was off by 10%.
That means some of these people are still voting for him. He's not gonna release when he's close and not releasing.
Can someone please tell that to @KellyannePolls since she states this isn't important to the voters.
“@KatyTurNBC: New Q poll: 75% think Trump should release tax returns - that includes 60% of Republicans” @MichaelSteele
@MichaelSteele @Morning_Joe @morningmika Perhaps someone should remind Michael Steele of these #'s.
never going to happen because it would reveal too much negative information.
Still not going to happen unless someone hacks them
If he won't do what the majority of Americans want him to do, what makes his supporters think he'll do anything else they want?
$200 mill in tv ads. David Duke, racist, misogynst & Trump ahead in polls. Proud to be deplorable. MSM so dishonest
I don't care about his taxes and he has my vote. HRC biggest gangster in US history. Liar, enables a sexual predator
Is he actually under a personal audit?
OR is it one of his holdings?
Didn't mean to send the last tweet until adding:
OR is there no personal audit at all?

Prove it by producing the IRS Notice
99% of Americans want to see Hillary's Deleted Emails too
- but do they feel strongly enough to withhold their vote if he doesn't?  They should.
For lawyers ... Considering serious questions of fraud and Nat'l security, are there grounds to sue Trump to reveal his taxes?
So much for Michael steele saying people don't care about them.
@Women4Trump & 100% of
those people will still vote 4 him. ; )

#MAGA #trumpagainsttheworld #TATW
the other 25 percent are really, really .... deplorable
Why has no one pushed back with these polls when a surrogate says voters don't care about his taxes or show focus group?
he should, but the Newsweek expose already tells voters what they need to know, as do his alt-right spox.
well his lawyers are not going to allow him unless the audit is over.. he released a letter from his lawyers too..
Michael Steele should see this poll. He said people don't care about seeing DT's taxes.
Hey Katy can you share that with @morningmika @Morning_Joe because just this morning they said there was no poll that said this
new poll 77% of people think Hillary is a criminal and has a bodydouble to cover for her serious illness
Tax returns ARE NOT a requirement to run for POTUS.  Sorry, thanks for playing. Enjoy your parting gifts..

The only ones who don't must be the Deplorables. These Rubes buy the Con hook,line,sinker and the whole damn rod. #CrookedDonald
but, but, American people don;t care. Trump & his kids said so.
is there any poll which asks if anyone will change their vote if DT does not release tax docs?
what percentage think Hillary should release her Goldman Sachs speeches and emails?
I like this poll better  http://goo.gl/yLNrtW 
I like this poll better  http://goo.gl/yLNrtW 
I think Trump and his surrogates should be jailed for inciting violence under the Fighting Words Doctrine.
Would you kindly tell that or show that to @realDonaldTrump . He keeps saying no one is interested.
And......he doesn't give a single fuck what 99.9% (reserving .1% for him and his spawn) of us think. Nope. Not a single fuck.
. Or as Michael Steel say's. " Nobody cares about his taxes!"
never gonna happen
BS! Let's talk about testimony fr this weeks HOC hearing & corrupt Cl Found! Why don't you show this
@realDonaldTrump yeah Cheatin' Donny...lets see 'em.
#Trump is showoff brags about his money. If he's hiding his tax returns you can bet there's a campaign-ending bombshell in them.
Someone should point that out to his sycophants.
Maybe someone should alert @KellyannePolls, since she claims in televised interviews this isn't true and polls don't exist.  @KatyTurNBC
somebody tell DT & his surrogates this, they repeatedly say nobody cares bout them, FALSE!!!!
he needs to release them. Why  should he come up with tax laws and won't  prove pays taxes himself?
lol and KellyAnn will say with straight face no one cares.
He never mentions that in the PollChat section of his rallies.
he knows, we know. Which is why we want him to.
says who?
But how many support releasing Trump's tax returns if doing so would torpedo his campaign?
Clinton birthday bash 250k u going https://www.google.com/amp/www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/15/clinton-foundation-throw-birthday-fundraiser-bill-manhattan/amp/?client=safari …
Those are high percentages, but honestly, why isn't it 100%? Who doesn't want to know what's in there?
It would be nice if he did, but why should he subject himself from the Media Bias coming from you and your left wing pals?
curious, how would releasing his tax returns allow the press to be biased?
They'll pick out something that they perceive as negative and for weeks straight, that’s all they’ll focus on BIAS
good luck with that, but, still, he will lose

The best candidate for protecting America's secrets is one who...
Have that in your pocket next time surrogate says no one cares.
