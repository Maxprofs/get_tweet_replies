About to speak before the vote: http://senate.gov/floor  #PriceIsWrong
@SenateDems No one is listening. Another nominee confirmed, another step toward the ACA being sent to the dustbin of history.
Senator Wyden - you make us proud. Keep fighting against these corrupt appointees & the Bannon/Trump administration
I believe this should be the new motto for the @GOP..."WE DON'T CARE"
@SenateDems @SenateGOP The right-wing has been obsessed with destroying the ACA & @RepTomPrice is their man. Many will suffer!
#Trumpcare Remember "Hoover Villages?"Price will be remembered for Trumpcare
The #Republicans have Become A Band Of Thieves. Not an ounce of Honesty Left, No Souls, No Heart. Remember in #2018
wyden is what is wrong. Drain the swamp
Wyden is fighting for our social safety net. But if you want to live in a swamp, these GOP assholes will be happy to provide one.
don't be hating because you don't get your way anymore. The time of the snowflakes is over. 
you do know snowflake was a term used by Nazis to describe ashes of Jews floating in the air? Fitting for you.
snowflake 
They are afraid of us. GOOD! #Proud Dem #indivisible #resist
Are you getting tired of losing yet? How about working WITH these people instead of battling them?
Keep fighting, Senator! A lot of us here in Ashland are on your side and are deeply troubled by these nominees.
Same thoughts here in Coos Bay!
and in Eugene!!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP  Martha Stewart went to PRISON for less than this POS. Rep. are SNAKES & POS. But Karma is alive and well!
Same sht different day. Trump and his fascist bolshevik plans need to be stopped at any cost!
Gee, what a surprise.
#PriceIsRight
NIGHTMARE
. @SenateGOP pushing these unqualified people thru as they know the Russian hacking scandal will end this sham soon.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP One more snake added to the swamp  One more part of big con Need to educate public for Dem wave 2018
Oh little ronnie, im sure there is a cry room for you and Schmuckie with crayons. Maybe a pacifier or two.
Why are you so partisan. No independent thought. Not good for Oregon!
@sorenmacbeth @SenateGOP if U were awake, Dems pushed thru Obamacare b4 all facts were in #hypocrite #readitbeforeknowingwhatsinit
As they have managed to do with nearly all the appointments. What can be done to challenge or stop this?
@SenateDems you are a career politician and will be voted out soon
so best case he's voted in 51-50.  DeVos was wrong. Sessions was wrong. Just another name to add to the list.
hero Price
I fell asleep during Cory's testimony. Y'all didn't have that luxury--and you were doing this for US. Thank you.
of course. Gops lack courge. Need to be sneaky.
it is time to give the Pres his cabinet. These are just stall tactics mostly build on lies. When will the left wake up?
Of course they did. What can be done to stop this?
What facts? Your made up crap?
@SenateDems @SenateGOP It's time to replace Senate Democrats in 2018. No more games
Silly me! I'd have thought serial proved lying to Congress would've been disqualifying. @SenJeffMerkley @PattyMurray
@SenateDems @SenateGOP I'm glad they are pushing this. You all have wasted to much time already. You are fighting the wrong fights
@SenateDems @SenateGOP You gave it your best. I watched CSPAN.
WHAT HORSE SHIT. GET IT DONE!
Thank your for another long night!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP #ImpotentGOP Martha Stewart was sent 2 jail 4 insider trading but Price 2 White House...#SwampThing
you and .@SenJeffMerkley must be exhausted. Thanks for your hard work this week!  I'm with you all the way on these nominations.
This is Twitter, we never sleep!
Thank You for standing up for what's right.
He should be indicted. His crime is worse than Insider trading. ANYONE voting yes is guilty of Accessory After the Fact
Where is the SEC in all this?  Where is the investigation?
stop playing games and find away to work with our president. We want change & not #obstruction #ronwydenget2work
Thank you for standing up for OR and the rest of the country!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP of course they are. The Republicans do whatever they want and brazenly. They do not care about this country
disgusting
#RepublicanAdministration is bad for democracy. Thank you, @RonWyden, for doing what you can. #resist
this all has to stop Trump is dangerous
The GOP wonders y we don't get along? Then they pull crap like pushing Rep Price thru  w/o all facts being hrd. #GOPPlaysDirty
This is not democracy. This is a Jihad.
Elections have consequences. Deal with it or leave
why are there no rules of conduct followed since Jan 20? when does the GOP become accountable for dismantling democracy
.@misskellybeez @RonWyden 
It's up to ALL of us to show up in '18 & '20 to defeat the GOP. Only then can we impeach & fix all the damage.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP what is happening??!!  Are they voting on Price now??
Thanks for hanging in there for us! They need to wait and get all the facts!
it's b/c they're part of the #FossilFuels coup.
Ron, you have to stop this. Find the evidence Traitor trump has committed Treason. For the sake of our country. Please

This is sick. Thanks for all you're doing - an Oregonian
@SenateDems @SenateGOP awake and pissed but focused. Will keep fighting
This constituent thanks you for fighting! Does @SenateGOP *want* us to distrust this cabinet? Do ethics not matter, anymore?
I'm awake, but little I can do since my senators blindly support Trump's picks. cc: @SenatorTimScott @GrahamBlog

@SenateDems @SenateGOP is shameless in voting for the most corrupt administration in recent history!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP medicaid age adjustment I see the thought process that supports it
Privatizing is a horse of a diff color
@RealLucasNeff @SenateGOP is there anything we can do to help stop or delay?
Rs IGNORING PROCESS!
Rs IGNOR CONSTITUION

Price is wrong for who "you" 
Sadly your friends in the lying media have made it impossible for the public to know #thx
@noahoregon @SenateGOP they pushed through DeVos with the facts in. Facts don't seem to matter.
Thank you for representing us, Senator!

Tom Price is corrupt, and We the People will remember the Republican Nazi Party in 2018
Sweet!
Ask him how he feels about Russia.

I do not understand the lack of due diligence before placing people in such positions of national responsibility.
WRONG!!!!
