So... Senate Republicans' budget cuts Medicaid by $1 trillion and cuts Medicare by $473 billion. 

That's all.
don't corporations provide jobs ........yes they do you dumbass cut taxes and quit spending money that isn't yours

1/ A few salient pieces from four years of  intensive reporting on gun violence. First, the staggering costs: http://bit.ly/2sP5x2P 
States run by Dems ultimately need adults in the room come and clean up the financial chaos mess, hence 37 states now R governors...no cred!
Have you SEEN Louisiana?
You add up to zero, puppet. Stop DNC talk, puppet and get to work making us great again! Your time is limited, get to work!
Nothing compared to Iran. 
Grifter-In-Chief & his Family, Admin & Cabinet of Grifters profiteering off Taxpayers! #Welfare4Rich. .@GOP Congress, NO #TaxCuts4Rich!
Yes they add up to a growing GDP greater opportunity and a larger tax base of employed Americans
This is only one side of tax cuts. Your fear is you can’t use tax money for your dumb liberal spending games
"Spending games" like giving the poor and elderly medical care? It's been proven tax cuts like these only help the wealthy
So....funding public good is bad, but funding unjust war is just fine?
Here's a way to a tax cut: get rid of handguns, and the amount the economy saves by reducing gun violence, return as a tax cut!
It has to balance somehow
We don't need a giveaway for billionaires. They idea it trickles down is roundly debunked by now. Just ask Kansas.
I wasn't condoning the tax cuts, just looking at them from an accounting standpoint
welfare for the rich? who woulda thunk it
this is not normal
But Puerto Rico is messing with the budget
Of for Fucks sake McConnell, be content with the court seat you stole.
What about the donations you've taken from wealthy corporations? Enough money to make you publicly defend unjust laws.
We paid that money in too medicare .Its time for we the people to sue for our money back
It's class warfare, plain and simple. The rich fund their campaigns so they will pass legislation like this. We absolutely cannot allow it.
Un-freaking-believable

blood for money just like the Iraq war
Healthcare admin needs to be decentralized to States
With every citizen being turned into a corporation so the federal reserve can make trades on us how much of that will go to the people ?
But Trump blames hurricane victims in PR for "throwing the budget out of whack."
They are NOT CUTTING MEDICAIDE OR MEDICARE@getfactsstraight
This rings hollow, coming from someone who was the DC ringleader for the TPP, which was for the benefit of corporations and not us.
@realDonaldTrump & @GOP are #unethical #immoral louses! We NEED #RobinHoodTax on rich & big corps 2 pay for #infrastructure & #GridUpgrade
If thats not what democrats wanted they wouldnt have used traitor slanders to kneecap hillary
Face it, if you and your cronies were competent in the first place, we would not likely be in this mess.
What's the budget deficit for 17/18? After cutting aid to children and seniors? And, giving the military a blank check? And 1% tax breaks?
@jbendery The wealthy already pay 51% of the total tax revenue. So how much more shoukd they pay?
.@GOP Congress has abdicated Exec Oversight responsibility in favor of #TaxCuts4Rich. Seems "soul of the Republican Party" focus still on $.
It's our fault, really. This is what we get for being stupid enough to be born into lower and middle class families. We're lazy and we suck.
Coincidence? 
@jbendery it's misleading to look at numbers alone. If Medicare has more waste in it then it is only right to cut more out.Need to know more
@jbendery 
OK.  Talk about gun control.
Coincidences take a lotta planning
They are trying to put me in the grave quicker. I'm a disabled 52 year old. Running 6 min miles one day to titanium spine and deg brain next
Maybe we can cut all trumps wasteful spending
@SenJohnMcCain @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowsky  $1.5 Trillion Deficit & Redirecting People's Benefits 4 #CorporateTaxCuts & #EstateTaxRepeal?
.@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan $1.5 Trillion Deficit & Redirecting People's Benefits 4 #CorporateTaxCuts & #EstateTaxRepeal-Gotta to be kidding!!

@SenPatRoberts @JerryMoran @RogerMarshallMD #ksleg @CJOnline
Implement a negative income tax, administer pharmacological freedom, and abolish the US from being a legal tax haven. Represent Americans 
You've been in office for decades. All you've done is raise taxes, national debt and amassed personal wealth of over $38 million. #GoAway

I'm biased.  With single payer/medicare for all, there would be no need for workers comp. The ones who deemed me pre existing to save a buck
btw:  The work comp "IME" used the arthritis loophole in Oregon Statute.  The only "pre existing" condition to not require proof.
Regularly lifting 100 lbs and hooking poles, covered injury for almost a year, then decided too expensive.
The company weas Broadspire/Sedjwick
Such a kind and caring SOB.  Impeach!
Who do we BEG in the @GOP to put people's lives before greed? (This is getting old.) #TrumpTaxScam
GOP must stop. This tax bill must not pass. These people —GOP—are demented.
Is there a link? Medical care gets cut to pay for Trump's $1.5 Trillion Tax Giveaway. Eliminating Estate Taxes for U.S. Royalty costs more.

Pentagon loses TRILLIONS$$ !?
What about this too?!!
The GOP seems to be h$$l-bent on a mission to sell out the middle class and poor.  Take away Medicare, Medicaid, forget to renew CHIP.
So again we take from the elderly, disabled and poor so @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP, the wealthy and corporations can have more .@SpeakerRyan
And Medford, OR will soon see 25% of it's operating budget go into PERS contributions. Yeah for public pensions.
US pensions have a $4 trillion unfunded liability. 

Another 20% of GDP that won't show up on any Debt:GDP metric 
Only people who might benefit from Medicare or Medicaid need worry.
Lets not forget the billion dollars your buddy Obozo gave the unions to buy votes.
U got that right. My tax goes up 10% @SenatorFischer & @SenSasse better not sell us out on this one like they did healthcare. Can't sell it
@CarmenYulinCruz don't expect help from Budget O. once cameras're gone. I'm glad you're so vocal when U did. Attention span's none existant
Keeping a greater % of OUR money is not a govt handout. Quite literally the opposite. You’ve been in DC too long...
YOU won't be keeping more money unless you're in the top quintile.
And they say we can't afford programs like PSLF which was a promise made to American workers a decade ago. Teachers are about to be screwed.
WTF!
But hey, “Puerto Rico broke the budget!”  Trump needs impeached. He’s deplorable.
GOP has the best math.
Pretty soon you're talking about real money.
Why isn't it called welfare when the government gives the wealthy a hand out?
They were already well and it's not fair?
