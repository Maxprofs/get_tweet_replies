@RonWyden @BleuishBleu Wyden is poster child of the emaciation of politicians. He knows PPH is an abortion and baby parts factory. Savage.
Oh My Goodness At Least We Know The Babies Are In Heaven @brownieelfdr @RonWyden
@RonWyden It's not healthcare. it's a decision to commit murder for pleasures of the flesh! one mans pleasure is another mans pain.
@RonWyden Do you also stand with Hitler?
@suspensewriter7 @RonWyden why yes, bC nazis & wanting the freedom to choose what to do with my body are 2 mutually exclusive things O wAIT
@_netflixqueen So killing babies in the second and thrid trimester for money is fine with you?  Talk about a misguided liberal.
@suspensewriter7 http://www.dailydot.com/politics/planned-parenthood-undercover-abortion-sting/ … read a little bit. Try not to believe everything you see in the media. Have a blessed day.
@_netflixqueen You should do the same and watch less MSNBC and CNN.
@RonWyden @SenateDems Please explain the health benefits of abortion.
@GrannySkywalker They also didn't judge me for needing help.
@erly Help with what?
@erly Correction: You made it my business when you used my tax dollars to receive it.
@GrannySkywalker @erly Are you stupid? Federal Taxpayers money is NOT used to fund abortions.
@ToddAshlee @erly Don't be simple. It frees up other money that IS used for abortion. Taxpayers provide 45% of total revenue for PP.
@RonWyden Stand with Joseph Mengele.  Quarrelling over prices for babies torn to pieces.  How could you?
.@RonWyden If you watched the four unedited videos, and endorse what is being done illegally to those baby's body parts, you're soulless.
I'm pretty confident that most liberals are indeed soulless!! @rjames1928 @RonWyden
@RonWyden http://go.shr.lc/1eRdNEh  Watch the video and check your vote.  These babies didn't get the right to life. Nothing to do with HEALTH
@RonWyden @SenateDems health care and abortion are not the same
@RonWyden @SenateDems abortion "health care" happens after the fact. She and baby walk in healthy. 1 leaves bleeding, the other 1 dies
@Hermoso1 @RonWyden @SenateDems GOOD ONE. KEEP UP THE GOOD TWEETS.
@RonWyden @SenateDems Your argument doesn't hold water!!  We, the people, don't want to fund abortions!
@RonWyden @SenateDems stand w/planned parenthood taking babies intact & possibly alive to sell body parts. proud of that? @FoxNews @CNN @CBS
.@RonWyden @SenateDems women don't lose their rights. There are 9,059 Community Health Clinics nationwide. #DefundPP
@danielleforil @ronwyden @senatedems Yes, but do they kill as many babies as PP? Because THAT'S the goal of Dems & pro-choice ghouls
@RonWyden to admit that you are wrong is to admit to the realization that you discarded flesh of your flesh. Silence = darkness
@RonWyden I'm all in.BUT usually pregnancy is not a "healthcare" issue 4 a woman.Abortion is unhealthy spiritually. mentally.and physicaly
@RonWyden @SenateDems IT;S NOT HEALTH CARE!! WE HAVE OBAMACARE NOW. DON'T FUND PP.  THEY ARE CROOKS. HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PARENTHOOD.
@RonWyden thanks for protecting my rights! Glad you are my Senator!
@RonWyden http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/29684960/area-attorney-calls-cps-an-adoption-mill-more-interested-in-money-than-kids …
@RonWyden Then why do you give CPS/DHS money to steal their children? #cpscorruption
major argument isnt abortion right now but selling parts,"sometimes we have some that already delivered but still want procedure" @RonWyden
@RonWyden @PPact Let me guess.......Wyden is a Democrat.  Am I right? PP gave $407,000 to Dems in 2014. Unscrupulous.
@RonWyden @SenateDems However, you believe that the worst experience of their lives benefits from selling their unborn for profit?  SICK.
@RonWyden
@PrevailChris @RonWyden #DefundPP
@RonWyden You are supporting an industry slaughtered >330,000 babies in 2013 alone. How evil is that? Pls have a moment with ur conscience..
@RonWyden  So do you use the Rendered baby Face cream
@RonWyden So you support the sale of less crunchy Baby parts. I assume this is because you Profit from the Abortions in some way.
@RonWyden justify this!
@RonWyden what about the BABY you fool! When do they have rights? All lives matter! #tcot #teaparty

@RonWyden I wish I was in OR to vote for you!
Living in another state doesn't stop progressive liberals from voting ..once or twice !!!  @ToddAshlee @RonWyden
@RonWyden
@RonWyden
@RonWyden @PPact  like being able to "keep their doctor"
@RonWyden doing his best to keeping PP's Margret Sanger inspired  Baby Chop Shops @ Work!
@RonWyden @PPact Right to choices? Why Obamacare then?
@RonWyden please don't dismiss right away that which you have not had time to look into, representing the people of Oregon requires effort
@RonWyden @PPact lol and you stand with selling baby parts and company that was started for eugenics ... Fire your pr department 
now please #StandAgainstTPP >  @RonWyden < #NoTPP
@RonWyden You did good on surveillance but you are on wrong side of history on defunding Planned Parenthood, a waaaay more important issue.
@RonWyden @PPact Shame on you.
@RonWyden @PPact I agree its the women's choice, but in the bedroom not after she conceives.It's sexist against men bc they don't have a say
@RonWyden Torture is Okay when it is an unwanted Baby, left is getting Hypocritical
@RonWyden @PPact That kind of endorsement is worth a least an arm and a leg.
@RonWyden @PPact http://www.anonymousedwin.com/the-traffic-in-fetal-body-parts/ …
@RonWyden @PPact I stand by Human rights. And I stand by #defundingplannedparenthood
@RonWyden You and everyone who stands with them will pay at the polls. Election day the people get to decide. You may stand alone.
@RonWyden Then you are as evil as they are or you arent capable of watching a video.
@RonWyden @SenateDems  As long as you're ok with murder, that's what counts
@RonWyden @SenateDems  NOT A BI PARTISAN ISSUE & THERE IS NO SPIN HERE DID U EVEN C THE VIDEOS WHAT U HEARD IS WHAT U HEARD.WHAT'S O CARE 4!
@RonWyden Despite all of the evidence showing their heinous and criminal acts, you still stand w/ PP? That is particularly sick Senator.
@RonWyden Those services are available without PP. How about you stand for the rights of the unborn to not get shredded for Lamborghinis.
@RonWyden Thank you, Oregon!@copco99
@RonWyden @PPact And who the fuck cares who you stand for?!
@RonWyden @PPact And the murder and torture of live fetuses. Have you watched the videos?
@RonWyden @PPact thank you!
@RonWyden @PPact STand really? thats the choice of words u use? EVIL minds....seriously go fund yourselves a perm vacation. #anotherboy
@RonWyden @SenateDems Infanticide> a right?  Adding profit to that....indeed?
@RonWyden Agree with only - woman’s right to make her own health care choices & her right to accessible, affordable care- pay for this work
@RonWyden @PPact do you stand for the babies that are obliviously getting dismantled by PP?  Or do they not have the same rights?
@RonWyden If that's the case, you're NO better than Dr. Kermit Gosnell. "Senator".
@RonWyden @SenateDems and you staying with illegal immigrants that kills young innocent American women
@RonWyden can you watch this video please? Please?
@Coondawg68 @RonWyden I saw a woman actually tweet to a man to 'stay out of a woman's choice' ...umm murder is a woman's choice???
@RonWyden @PPact I thought #PlannedParenthood just said men have no say in this? Sit down, Ron.
@RonWyden @PPact #itsanotherboy
@RonWyden Let's be clear - "health care choices" is a euphemism for murder of the unborn. Have you even watched the videos? Indefensible.
@RonWyden So to clarify, you're OK with Pp delivering babies THEN cutting them into pieces and selling the parts.  Good to know.
@RonWyden @PPact  I stand with unborn children's rights to actually get to make any choice one day. #AnotherBoy
@RonWyden @PPact I want to know more about abortion and care. I feel like they don't work together since abortion kills an infant. #StoPP
@RonWyden Nobody has the right to kill other humans for his/her own health! #DefundPP
@RonWyden @PPact
Umm, the bill still provides $ to clinics. It's not a spending cut. Read the bill. @RonWyden @PPact
@RonWyden What you're doing is encouraging women to KILL their babies for more sexual joy, convenience, & whatever. Even pigs don't do that.
@RonWyden How can you support Sanger's #eugenic brainchild (Planned Parenthood) knowing it was created to exterminate black population?
@RonWyden Would behoove PP to advocate birth control more strongly, as they used to when I volunteered years ago.
@RonWyden Hey, Asshole... Whom you have forwarded this letter from Germany? - It was about Snowden in Moscow.
Is it a woman's choice to have her baby killed after it is born alive. @RonWyden
@RonWyden @PPact And to profit from selling aborted baby parts.  Nice to know where you stand on humanity Senator!  BROTHER!!
@RonWyden Senator, please stop lying to us. Thank you. #AnotherBoy
@RonWyden These are HIGH RANKING PEOPLE. Oh my. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWQuZMvcFA8 … #AnotherBoy
@RonWyden Then let them pay for it themselves. Stop stealing my $$$. Ok?
@RonWyden @PPact watch this. https://youtu.be/GWQuZMvcFA8 
@RonWyden @SenateDems Care is not killing infants. That is not care. I said it once, I'll say it again. #AnotherBoy
@RonWyden who r u a Boris Karloff want a be?
@RonWyden @PPact isn't this the same argument yall used to sell the ACA? Can't have both. Pick one.
@RonWyden @PPact What you stand for Ron is a global, state sponsored, unborn holocaust. There's blood on your hands.
@RonWyden @PPact Gee, Ron, tell me, specifically what ObamaCare covers.
@RonWyden A woman's choice ends when she hits different DNA. Then she needs to put on her big girl panties & protect the defenseless. @PPact
@RonWyden @PPact #AbortionIsNotHealthcare
@RonWyden
@RonWyden and don't forget, run a chop shop for parts.....
@RonWyden @SenateDems Typical dems. Pay for murder of innocent babies, yet give out hugs to thugs.
@RonWyden @SenateDems Harvesting human baby parts is not about women making health care choices. Its barbaric
@RonWyden Obamacare has rendered #PlannedParenthood obsolete now that all women have access to health care from a primary care physician.
@RonWyden @PPact  relies on the personal, societal, and spiritual shame of the abortion victims to stay silent.
@RonWyden @WydenPress I stand with a woman's right to make her own decisions: paying for her own health care #GetOutOfMyWallet & #OffMyDime!
@madhatternews @RonWyden @WydenPress So you really mean that you enjoy human suffering?
@RonWyden @SenateDems Why is Homeland Security following Black Lives Matter?
