Cassidy is acting like a physican at a dine n dash paid for by insurance cos instead of pharma. Makes one wonder what he's getting.
This might shed some light on where Cassidy's loyalties lie:
He's a Koch minion too. Lovely.
His #1 donor is a vulture hedge fund... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Management_Corporation …
1/ Really disgusting how money seems to matter more than the voices of voters. If reps treated their constituents like customers, they
2/ might take the time to actually track & analyze comments so they could make an informed decision based on data. But $ has more weight.
Absolutely! Until we DEMAND legislation that gets $ out of politics, we will b stuck w greedy pols like Cassidy who do the bidding of donors
Cassidy says states should have control.  Hey Bill do u send ur kids to a LA state school?  Trick ?, nobody but the really poor does.
Cassidy also supports "abstinence only" sex ex & fights funding 4 family planning. Yet his unmarried teen daughter had a baby
Oh you forget, they are the GOOD  people who get to have children under any circumstances. Just like Palin's kid.
But Cassidy actively tries to hide his unwed daughter and grandchild....while preaching "family values" and "personal responsibility"
And lest we forget, the TAX PAYERS paid the bill for the birth of Cassidy's grandchild. Yet he wants to deny prenatal care for other women
What are the chances 1) he actually reads this letter, 2) admits he fucked up, 3) withdraws his namesake legislation? I *hate* politicians.
0. My wife presented similar concerns last go-around, got a form letter back saying "Rep Cassidy stands as a voice for all Louisianians."
I received the same response (despite a personal meeting at his office). So much for his pledge as a doctor to "Do No Harm."
At this point, I've resorted to daily faxes via ResistBOT to really drive the point home
For every pol that votes FOR this bill, I'm going to send $1 to the campaign of their opposition, next time that pol is up for re-election.
If a few hundred thousand people did the same, the results could be devastating for the pols who vote in favor of #GrahamCassidy
Cassidy doesn't care about Louisiana or its people and that's been obvious from the beginning of his term. Gotta vote him out of office.
A quick look @ who pays Cassidy is very eye opening https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/contributors?cid=N00030245&cycle=2018&type=C …
Koch brothers are buying every GOP senator
Cassidy's #4 donor, Gilead, is big pharma. Guess who he works for? Not us.
Do you REALLY think he cares about the people of Louisiana? I don't.
At this point I can only think that he cares about having his name in a landmark bill. It will be the Graham bill when he loses his seat.
An eloquent example of statesmanship - rock on
Great, clear letter of opposition and proposal for productive dialogue!  I hope he gives you as thoughtful a response!
@SenJohnMcCain This deadly Bill is BAD for Cassidy's own State!  Please vote NO!!
Louisiana voters have demonstrated they don't care.  Otherwise, why do they vote for people who don't care about them?
Unmarried pregnant women nearly all qualify for Medicaid as do their children and did so before the state accepted additional federal funds
A must read for Louisianians
Finally, it is impossible for the market to bear the costs of all high morbidity patients. They consume most of the resources
Medicaid isn't and never has been long term insurance. It pays poorly for everything except obstetrics and pediatrics
Data-driven and committed to reasonable dialogue. #healthpolicy needs more of this. Thank you Dr Gee!!
He did promise to help people, he promised to R&R
An insurance market without risk stratification will definitely fail. It's the entire basis of n insurance market
Thank you for standing up for citizens of Louisiana , Dr.Gee.   As a medical professional, I see the harm of what this bill could do.
No primary challenge
Dear God, what is the crushing impetus the GOP feels that is driving them 4ward in their quest to uninsure & potentially kill 32 mil people?
How did these people ever survive before 2014 #hyperbole
He never gave a damn about his home state or those that voted him. His agenda is to take from the poor, disabled and give it to the rich.
I'm pretty sure he's already resigned 2 his role as tyrant of the USA & all-around supporter of "assisted suicide". A willing president pawn
Assisted suicide? LA has 1 of the highest suicide rates in the US. Cassidy encourages constituents to have guns.
You never thought this phrase through did you? Think hard. When someone assist a person w/ death wish, what'll others out the ring think?
Unfortunately, I know abt this subject. My daughter shot & killed herself after our mess of a healthcare system refused her proper treatment
We've all experienced the death of a loved one. But it's heartbreaking 2 hear that. I wish I could empathize w/ u, but u have my sympathies.
Like he could give a crap! He's owned by big business, just like his peers.
He Lied to KIMMEL But MOST IMPORTANTLY He LIED TO His STATE! How dumb IS ITto CONCOCT SUCH A DAMAGING BILL.ALABAMA will be HIT HARD AS WELL
1 of the reason's a democratic governor got elected in Louisiana was the promise of expansion ,hope the people realize who will take it away
Please vote no @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn
Thank you for sending this letter.
Imagine if you could by cheap, third party funded homeowners insurance AFTER your house caught fire. The expense would be prohibitive
You are AWESOME
Thank you Dr. Gee! I am esp. concerned w/ the horrible impact on HCBS, a more natural, dignified, cost effective system of care.
Unfortunately, Cassidy's concern is for his donors, not his constituents. #Killthebill

Warning. It s a thread about the current state of healthcare insurance and its bleak future. It's very blunt. Crude. And it's our story ..
He doesn't care. None of them care. They want "Obamacare" gone no matter who it hurts or kills. Him and all the guys voting for it.
Voters in your state sadly don't seem to care. But should. #TrumpCare #SaveACA
“The legislation you’ve introduced this past week gravely threatens health care access & coverage for our state & its people,” Gee wrote.
@BillCassidy are you listening to your own constituents??
Your letter might be effective if the Senator thought he actually represented all citizens of Louisiana. His actions prove otherwise.
Cassidy represents his donors. Period
Very well done!  Logical and important, tactfully done without hyperbole or linguistic violence.  Keep hitting size of <50% FPL, important!
@Louisiana_sos did you know that your own Senator hates Louisiana?
Well stated.
I'm afraid that he's OK with killing the wrong kind of people: POC, handicapped, poor, mentally ill, LGBQT & women.
Thank you! Sec. Gee I hope your reasonable words result in some good. All I could manage was questioning his intelligence and morality
Come on Bill @BillCassidy withdraw it! This bill sucks for America and Americans. Does a partisan victory override the tens of Millions?
How is it that you care so little for the people of this country? You know this will hurt those with pre-existing conditions the most.
Add to your letter to @BillCassidy  a check for $800K and *maybe* it will mean something to this POS.
Mr Cassidy withdraw your proposal TODAY!!
50 yrs still 2 Americas & in mine we're still 'perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity'
Im in FL but we face same issues w/ Gov & Rubio who I voted 4. Thank u 4 standing up 4 the voiceless & those w/o representation. God bless U
@RonWyden @BillCassidy he doesn't care!!!!!!
Dr. Gee, thank you for this crystal-clear explainer, which hopefully will make the truth as evident to @BillCassidy as it is to me.
Don't hold your breath on this Rebeka
I bet he didn't even read your letter. #GrahamCassidyBill is as good for America as another oil spill into the Gulf and the next Katrina.
We demand you vote no or you will be voted out!
I only see Republicans benefiting from corporate cash here ......... showing who contributes to and funds @BillCassidy (R)
He doesn't care about us, he is party before humanity and that will hurt him in the next election.
.
5
He doesn't care. The Koch brothers guaranteed him $$$, what does he need votes for?
The bill itself shows that he does not give a shit about people of Louisiana which are all his constituents.
I sincerely hope that he will take the time to read & absorb your critique. We would be like to see him vote to protect his constituents.

Also call Senate Finance Cmt. The only hearing be held on 09/25 & request them to extend the discussion beyond only 2 mins &delay the voting 
He doesn't care about the people of Louisiana.  He told us what the moral imperative was then took the cash instead!
We're living in the era of "get yours now." They'll figure out some lies to win back those they've hurt, and it will probably work.
Thank you for writing this letter! #UnitedBlue #TheResistance
He don't care
He ain't fair 
He's got the insurance card that's gold
You can die
He won't try 
The devil has got his soul
Be suspicious of any MD that turns politician.  Clear "do no harm" has gone right out the window.....and this asshole ....
He doesn't care about Louisiana. He's a coward.
Like he doesn't know?

He doesn't give 2 fucks
To All Americans:  You don't need to repeal and replace Your Medical care.  You need to REFORM OR REPLACE the $$$ Health Insurance Companies
He and Graham are TURNCOATS and Trump Klan Swamp Slime Butt SUCKERS!!!
I called his office today and his staff insist he is doing this for the ppl of La. since he won on repeal, he is doing this for them
@GOP does not care.  They want you poor, destitute, homeless, or preferably dead. We are snowflakes gathering for Avalanche #2018
Bill Cassidy is a proven liar. And a subjective morally bankrupt human. Respond Bill. Respond. How much did you get from the Kochs?!
please keep telling the truth about this horrible bill. @BillCassidy what are you thinking about?
Thank you so much @rebekahgeemd !! Please keep trying!
@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @RandPaul @SenateGOP @LindseyGrahamSC Please VOTE NO on this horrible bill!!
These GOP guys don't care because they don't care about their constituents. They care only about themselves and money period
They like to think it will only hurt his opponent's voters, not his own. Doesn't know his own state demographics.
Complaining doesn't work. Calls do. We've proved that!
Dr. Gee - I know you don't want to be cynical, but Cassidy simply does not care. He is of the Party of People Who Simply Do Not Care. #GOP
They done care what is it going to take for people to see this?
Merry Christmas, Bill. Here's to your Nov. defeat.
My dear Rebekah's , how is your prayers ? Talk to God direct , our self wills are cause for slower or for faster healing. He heals us.
Exodus 15:26 I am the Lord, your healer.
You are thinking of your State. Silly you, he works for Koch!
You say that like he would care.
This is what I like to see, someone that disagrees with something, and instead of just saying it's bad is using logic and reason. Thank you.
Koch Brothers money. Blue Cross money. Screw the people of Louisiana!
SIMPLY AMAZING THAT SEN CASSIDY IN GOOD CONSCIOUS FILE A BILL@THAT SO DAMAGES THE INTEREST OF THE LOUISIANA POOR AND WORKING FOLK! SO SAD!
I agree!
What snowflakes
GOP = Greed Over People
Thank you for your due diligence.  I hope Sen. Cassidy closely studies this and reconsiders!
Yes, but does wonders for the Koch brothers!
The loss of lives and jobs because of Obama Care made many Americans Suffer...#Repeal !
So, will it hurt the wealthy or just (shaking head) the disenfranchised poor?
OUR HOME HE COULD CARE LESS HONEY IT IS ABOUT HOW MUCH WILL HE COLLECT THANK YOU
@BillCassidy your own HHS secretary is not supportive of this bill. @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
Cassidy is a truly dumb guy. But what does that say about folks who elected him?
@RonWyden @BillCassidy 2/ The Rebekah and Ron Solution: Do nothing!
@RonWyden @BillCassidy 1/ The ACA is imploding millions have already lost coverage with millions more set to join them.
#RecallCassidy
Wish 49 other secretaries dept of health wud outline impact to their states. they may not all be intelligent, even minded as @Rebekahgeemd
Thank you, Rebeka, for caring about your constituents. @SenateDems and @GOP  Vote NO.
One can only wonder if money is changing hands under the table!
Thank you. I wrote to Cassidy too. His interest is absolutely not the needs of the people of the state he pretends to represent and I'm one.
He might not care Secretary.
Wonder no more. The Koch donor network will give GOP $400M for 2018 *only if ACA is repealed* & tax reform passes https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/26/koch-network-piggy-banks-closed-republicans-healthcare-tax-reform …
Thank you, Dr. Gee, for supporting all the citizens of LA! I hope the GOP will read, understand, take to heart, follow through.

Thank you, @rebekahgeemd too bad @billcassidy traded the "hypocritic" oath for the Hippocratic Oath. #protectourcare
.@MyLAAAP
They don't care.  This is all @GOP cares about.
He doesn't represent LA. He represents the Kochs.
And now we know the rest of the story! @BillCassidy you've been exposed! #greedybastard #survivalofthefittest
So, @SenCassidy, is this how you take care of #Louisiana? Or, are Dr. @rebekahgeemd and I missing something? Educate us because this stinks.
Please consider this, @SenJohnMcCain @SenSusanCollins @lisamurkowski because @SenCassidy seems to be ignoring his own constituents.
He does t care!  He's getting g rich on this!!  #SaveACA
Do not shove this bill down our throats, it a death sentence bill for those with pre-existing conditions.
Louisiana would benefit more from a healthier relationship with a federal government with sound finances and respect for jurisdictions.
Why are people complaining when you knew this is what was going to happen? Go vote in local and state elections. Speak with other voters
He doesn't care. He got to satisfy that 35% base. The world knows how selfish we are. They just heard 45's speech.
I think he is doing what he was elected to do. This is the will of the people. They wanted GOP to cut funding. He is doing that.
Excellent letter!  More states should be doing this. Thank you for caring.  #SaveACA
Thank you.
Nice work screwing over your own state @BillCassidy
Thank you!
I guess they don't care just like they don't care about their rouge PD
Thank you, it's on this page:
He doesn't pay for his insurance why should he care what the other side pays.
Thank you @rebekahgeemd
#GOPDONTGIVEAF0CK #GOPHATESICKPOOR #GOPHATESUS #WANNABDICKTRAITOR #COMPROMISEDPRESIDENCY #IMPEACH #Hyprocrasy
Might want to remind him what FPL stands for. He doesn't seem to know much about poverty.
My daughter lives full time and I live part time in LA. This bill is a travesty to a great state. Thank you, Ms. Gee, for standing up for LA

Tell your representatives to vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill.
Unfortunately, he doesn't care.
Please publish his reply.
@SenJohnMcCain @senrobportman @JohnKasich our states will be hurt too!
You make the mistake of believing he cares about his home state. And that those who vote for him care about themselves. However, thank you
A democrat/liberal not independent
Unbelievable Sen Cassidy could move forward with this bill given this information.
Save us @rebekahgeemd
Party first.  Period.
What makes this more disconcerting is that he has an M.D. attached to his name. Disgusting.
Selling out your own constituents @BillCassidy   So bad. They trusted you. 
If this weren't so serious, one would think this is a joke. How could you possibly do this to your own State??!!
I'm glad I wasn't a patient of his. No empathy or care for the patient.
your Tweet was quoted by @voxdotcom
I like this one...#CassidyGraham "Singles-out Louisiana for disproportional cuts to our Federal funding." Nice work senator.
He doesn't care
If he doesn't back off/change this bill, I hope people vote him out in his next election. You deserve a rep that will HELP, not harm, you.
TY
U eloquently spelled out caustic potentially outcome 4 Louisiana
Which mimics many other rural areas & cities in US
@GOP MUST READ letter
How much do you want to bet that he really doesn't care?
he does no care..
Look, he is a Republican and they simply do not give a tinker's damn about the lives of anyone outside their country club. #Truth #Fact
I've found that a flaming bag of dogpoop also works.
Cassidy- why do you hate Louisianans so much that you want destroy their health & wellbeing?Is THAT what gets you up in am? #ACASavesLives
They don't care as they don't have to have it. If they aren't on it - the plan will be more crap. We even pay for their healthcare.
Thanks, Rebekah. I contacted Sen @BillCassidy, too, but I hope he'll pay attention to an expert. The bill doesn't pass Jimmy Kimmel test.
@SenMcCain please note.
Let us follow The @GOP Direction to exterminate all people with pre-existing conditions. It is the only way to #MAGA
Our leader @realDonaldTrump should decide who deserves to live in die. That's why we elected him! It's the will of the people.
It's a great letter, but it's too long. You lost his attention in the first graph.
The Health & livelihood of the people of Louisiana are small sacrifices for the benefit of tax cuts. Wealth & power must be preserved! #MAGA
THANK YOU!
Thank you, Dr. Gee. (Not a citizen of LA but want health care improved for all.)
Same here!!
(202) 224-3121

Tell your representatives to vote NO on the Graham-Cassidy “health care” bill.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump This is #DEATHCARE #Inhumane
Mr. Cassidy PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE listen to Dr. Gee.
Thank you for your reasoned response. I implore you @BillCassidy  not to pursue this bill. I have worked my whole life but now depend on
2/ Medicaid due to disability. My COPD medication are expensive and w/o them my life is in jeopardy.  Medicaid expansion in LA provide me
3/ those medications while I was transitioning from work insurance  to disability. W/O expansion there would have been 6+ months w/o meds
4/ increasing my risk for exacerbation requiring ER or hospitalization. Unable to pay for these services the cost would be passed on to tax
5/ payers and hospitals at a much greater cost. These practices are text book examples of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Your
6/ bill while appealing to your political base will do nothing to control medical costs, irreparably harm poor and vulnerable ppl, strain
7/ small hospitals, & damage your reputation & political future. Bobby Jindal's fall should serve as a warning 2 you when ideology is master
Never seen pols so obsessed about an issue that affects so many. Their paymasters must really be turning the screws on them.
Louisiana's citizens should demand Cassidy forfeit his medical license. He is not complying with his oath.
Report Cassidy to the Louisiana Medical Board for violation of the Rules of Conduct.
Good luck working with the jackals of the GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @RonJohnsonWI The rich & privileged got theirs.  Rest of us just need to die.
He doesn't care. I'm sure he's getting money from insurance and pharma lobbyists. #ACA #CassidyGraham
Great letter. Should be letter to editor in every newspaper in LA. Similar letter for AZ and in all papers. @IndivisibleTeam @TopherSpiro
AND..HE..GIVE..ONE..RATS..ASS! About the destruction this will do to AMERICANS Madam @lisamurkowski @SenSusanCollins @SenJohnMcCain
We'll see if McCain is "principled" or he would go with his buddy Graham.
It will hurt Georgians immensely, too, @sendavidperdue @SenatorIsakson
Unfortunately they don't care.
The supporters of this bill do not care. If it is so good, why don't the senators and the congressional reps have this for themselves?
@BillCassidy your bill, my dear Senator, is akin to social Darwinism.
Problem is we want to think people like him actually care about their constituents. Sadly, they don't!
He doesn't care.
Cassidy doesn't care. He just wants to get rid of anything Obama.
@stephgracela @BillCassidy Thank You Dr. Gee
