I know, I know, it's so strange to have a president that's had a job
Had a job but no transparency means we don't know where his money actually came from. That's a problem from a president.
I forgot, transparency is back, my bad.  It was a long 8 years.
I'd like to point out that just about every presidential candidate in recent history has provided them, Democrat and Republican alike.
That's fine, I get it.  I actually don't even much care for Trump, my problem is the sudden resurgence of journalism and fact finding.
I'm not gonna be quiet while Trump gets hammered, justified or not, while Obama's administration is laughably called 'scandal free'
Obama wasn't perfect but no president has been.
Be honest here, what do you think at the end of this Trump Russia rainbow?  Some pissant $5 million oil deal?
Trump's ‘official’ response:
Here's @KellyannePolls with an update on release of Trump's taxes. #TrumpTaxReturns 

@RonWyden @Mighty_Fetta @realDonaldTrump #resist
I don't want to look at or hear from Kellyanne ever again.  She sickens me in every way possible. #CrookedTrump #LyingKellyanne #trumprussia
she is pretty irrelevant altho she tries hard not to be.
I hate that she pops up on my twitter feed or on TV or anywhere my eyes happen to be.  Her face invokes my gag reflex....

And if a trump supporter said this about Micheal... I mean Michelle Obama, they would be called racist and bigoted.

I hate Ron Wyden and the way he makes millions selling citizens private info.
That's a whole other subject. But for the most part. They all do it.
Whistle blowers from DOJ and elsewhere have shared quite a bit with me on the "doings" of said concerned elected representatives.
A mud slinging shit show. Disgusting!
Me? I'm just sharing what victims share with me.
Could this be fake news? I'm serious...Not trying to argue. I don't do that with people...Just those who lead our Country
It's a well-known fact the ODOJ's been corrupt and violated rights in highly political matters no one responsible has done anything about it
You no he would t do that
Ron, I realize you are a Democrat, but people got all over stupid Bush 43 yet Obama's college records were buried forever by leftist Univtys
Lets see how Trump graduated Wharton when he can barely read. Oh, that's right daddy paid $$ after T flunked out of military school.
Trump- due to constant harrassment, @BarackObama gave birth certificate./ U promised #TrumpTaxes , so pls expect same, only louder&longer
Haha uh no. The grand Cheeto won't release tax returns unless subpoenaed. It would too obviously fuck him in public perception if he did
How has no one figured out a clever way to get it with litigation? Why we let Melania get settlement $. Should have crowdsourced countersuit
They would have to prove a need and Trump would have to be investigated. Multiple gov groups have been looking into this since Trump first
@InSpiteOfTrump @realDonaldTrump lol. He already said if elected he would. #LiarInChief #ImpeachTrump
#TrumpRussia
When is the left going to realize that releasing your tax records is not a requirement to be President.  There are other dead horses to beat
Well, a month later and you're still about 
17,981,500 shy.
                                             We know not to hold our breath Senator.
He wouldn't do it if every person in America retweets it #coward
NY has a better plan. They're prosecuting.
I'll predict the answer like Andrew Jackson predicted the Civil War & the answer is NO
Release your tax records, ask Obama and Hillary to release theirs . Trump is your POTUS  treat him with the respect he deserves
Criminals do not hand over evidence without coercion. #Republicans are stonewalling, making them accomplices

#Trumprussia #TrumpTaxes
sick of asking for retweets when we should really be asking people for noticeable action
No one works harder for his constituents, than Senator Wyden. Oregonians are honored and appreciative of his tireless work. @RonWyden
regardless, retweets do not change administrations!
True, but Ron is working on that too. Did you know he is on the Senate Intelligence Committee?
I'm very well aware thank you :) Still doesn't mean retweets are the least bit effective against foreign interference in elections
I just want anything to help. I'm with you. I get up each day and hope this is going to be the day this nightmare is over.
I hear ya. I just want our efforts to be impactful. So, so frustrated :(
I have never been so worried or frightened for our country. It feels so very personal and violating. I need this #TrumpRussia situation over
Dear Senator Wyden he's already went back on his word to release his tax returns once if not more the character of the president of USA bad.
He went back on his word on nearly all promises! Serial liar!
Proof please? He's fulfilled many promises already-and it hasn't been 100 days yet.
Like what
simple answer is no..no reason to appease demoroids...find a new hobby..
I hope Mueller is looking at them right now. 
@potus.. You're lucky to get 18,000 re tweets for such a partisan, leftist, vacuous charge, you snowflake.
Instead of tweeting about it, set a good example by releasing yours.
..….he probably has LIKE ANY OTHER POLITICAN. trump is also the one getting investigated by the FBI so there's that.
Wrong and wrong. No politician is required to release tax returns, and most don't. And Trump is not being investigated by FBI.
Not required, but when every single predecessor going back multiple decades has, it raises red flags. His excuse (audit) is pitiful as well
Not only is the excuse pitiful it's probably a lie.
Yup yup
RETWEETED!
Move on mr. Wyden
Wyden is a Dem HACK. Expect nothing  EXCEPT NWO, Ag21 *BS*. US WILL NEVER SUBMIT.
Don't you have better things to worry about? MOVE ON! Our country has bigger problems than tax returns!
Why do people really give a shit about Trumps tax returns. I don't care. Why do you care? The guy is a millionaire. So what.
The left should look more at why the Clintons and Obama are millionaires because of middle east money. Their Globalization plan failed.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump well lets see....how long did Barry take to produce a fake birth certificate?
NO HELL NO he won't!!!
At this rate, this tweet will take 20 years to get 18 million retweets. We shouldn't try to make deals with Trump, he's a liar and huckster.
So far 18k tweets, there aren't 18k reporters!
Thank you Senator Wyden!
He's NEVER going to release them. They will prove him guilty of something that will put him in jail.
At this rate it will take a few more years!
Only after you release yours.
No. There's no requirement for him to do so. Besides, all the illegally-obtained 2005 return showed was that he pays his fair share of tax.
Irrelevant, Senator: focus on taking back the Congress in 2018 and then, having done so, force the issue.
U seem to think u have far more power than u really have...
Little off base with that tweet Ronnie..
@RonWyden are you on one of the committees that can ask for them?  Can they be made public or just background for hearings? #TaxReturns
I'm starting a march 2 "NOT release the taxes!"How about "march 4 emails" It's like Hamsters on a treadmill! Next is Tail chasing. Repeat!
Term limits are more important 
Time for change with lifer politicians riding on the tax payers dollors making millions
So close!
He will NEVER release them!

answer: HELL NO
If this gets 18 mil RTs will you stand for #MedicareForAll & #NoMoreWar?
Cuz Damn
#TaxMarch = #Establishment crap
Ron, spend some time getting #ProjectDragnet released far more important
He said, "When Hillary releases her 30K emails" did she find them?
We all know the answer to this. He'll wince and whine, and shuffle to distract the media again, and probably insult another ally instead.
MY Senator!  LUV!
Dump cried & bitched about Obama's birth certificate, he deserves the same thing he gave Obama. @claudinerlco @realDonaldTrump

@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump : No, we haven't forgotten about your lack of transparency#release your tax returns
Just get a judge to subpoena the returns. It's not that hard. No one is above the law including phucking Trump.
Either way, @realDonaldTrump, could you stop flirting with the 1st Daughter? I have girls. It makes us physically sick and horribly ashamed.
of course he won't (probably because if Trump's supporters saw how he makes/sustains his money, they'd have a bigly cow)
Until Trump shows proof he has judgment unfettered by bad financial deals he's illegitimate.#WhatAreYouHiding
I care!  Thank you and keep it up!
Not ASKING anymore.. DEMANDING!
Force collusion investigation, impeach Trump b4 he kills anyone else, he will. STOP HIM.
Not unless someone like a judge makes him, he's a CROOK. He colluded with Russia, now he's trying to change subject by bombing everyone.
HA! Make sure you sit and wait. This  gotten away with it so long he'll die before we see it. If his little LIARS ALLOW IT.
release your tax returns.
Impeach
Wyden FYI - this is why Democrats keep losing

@robreiner RT
Maddow release Pres Trump 2005 taxes. He paid more in taxes then Obama and Sanders. 28% Pres Trump 18%Obama 13% Sanders. LMAO TY Maddow
This article: DNC and Alt-left are Terrorist. 
I'm game
It's NOT a requirement.  He shouldn't, it's confidential between IRS and citizen.
Is there a way to re-tweet something more than once? Not joking- I'm new to twitter. Awesome idea, though.
A tax return was already illegally released showing he has paid a higher percentage of tax than previous recent presidents. Not enough?
Now you are speaking Trump's language in140 characters or less.
From his cold dead hands! He would rather take our guns first!
why would he. He's the president. Those taxes will be released
I retweeted, but Trump isn't a man of his word. He's the devil incarnate! Wake Up America!
He's a billionaire and ur not. Don't need to see tax returns.
really...don't need to see how much $ he owes Russia (if that's even on his record-see his house he sold), or China. No bigs, total jelly
He's president now. Don't care about that bullshit. Not gonna change the fact he won crooked hillary lost. Pick a better candidate
@IndivisibleTeam @realDonaldTrump No he wouldn't. He is hiding something. I've said it 100x before. Repub. can vote to release
@AmericasRachel @realDonaldTrump No! absolutely Not!!
HE WON'T..BROKEN EVERY PRECEDENT IN THE WORLD! TEFLON DON GETS AWAY WITH IT ALL. THOSE TRIPS TO MAR-A-LAGO COST A FORTUNE.THANK GOD CAN'T GI
why ask him?? WHO CAN REQUIRE THIS DOCUMENTS/ABOVE THE LAW?  WHY?
because he’s the president of the most powerful country in the world and we the voters should know
I AGREE / but who can require those documents.. /
well they will have to pass a law for future cases. FBI can get it if needed during investigations
thank you../sorry for my english/french canadian here/
you did great! No problem. :-)
The only thing @POTUS wants to release are the farts of his ego.
Who cares about his tax returns
Well they'd be useful in figuring out his conflicts of interest, not to mention his ties to foreign governments.
The President does not have to. He is working for free, are you? Most of us could care less about his tax return.
TAX RETURNS NOT REQUIRED...HE SUBMITTED REQUIRED FINANCIALS! GET OVER IT (NO)
He will literally start WW3 before be releases tax returns as it will expose his #RussiaGate
@_TimRosenthal @realDonaldTrump if it gets 18 mil retweets will u resign?
Despite ur claims no 1 cares about ur tax returns, we do. Failure to release indicates there is something to hide. Guilty ppl hide things.
“@RonWyden: .@realdonaldtrump if this gets 18 million retweets, will you release your tax returns?”  If it works for nuggets...
.@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Probably not but I'm for trying!
Well Hell even if he answers yes Russia might tamper with  the votes so he doesn't have to...
Pls r/t @th3j35t3r @JoyAnnReid @Alyssa_Milano @AshleyJudd @MikeLevinCA @MikeRJohnson777 @NTrexit @LawyerRogelio @LouiseMensch @mcspocky

His word is worthless anyways
After seeing Bernie paid 19percent you better find another waste of time. Nobody cares
Only if one if them is by Vladimir Putin.
Did you miss where Maddow showed the world that @realDonaldTRump make A LOT of money and pays A LOT in taxes? Isn't that a good thing?
You people don't get it. We DON'T care what hs tax returns look like. We care what OURS look like.
@goldngems @realDonaldTrump let's see 'em, now.
You could get 7bil. Rt's and he wouldn't release.
Full speed ahead..............
keep trying even if repugs vote no
He should release his tax returns even if this only gets one retweet.
Has @POTUS and/or @WhiteHouse responded yet?  I'm not sure @realDonaldTrump actually READS anything anyone else says.
If this gets 5 retweets will yoy retire
It could the rt of every twitter account ever made in the united states...he aint releasing them. Why would he answer to the people? 
Release your taxes. What are you hiding?
@ninaandtito @realDonaldTrump no he won't. Too much incriminating data in them.
Who cares ? Clown 
Someone's tax returns are none of your business. Especially if you defended keeping Obama's college records sealed.
Hey #TheResistance JOIN TAX MARCH SAT or Start your OWN !!

@maddow
NEED 18M RT - Come on #TheResistance
Hey Senator, if Trump doesn't release his tax returns, does that mean I don't have to (on the 15th?)  :D
I would rather see you prove you and your wife and children actually live in Oregon. Weekends and holidays don't count.
Something tells me that @carterjwm will be getting nugs from @Wendys before @realDonaldTrump will stop hiding whatever he's hiding.
, looks like @realDonaldTrump has more friends than you. AAAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Yay!
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @washingtonpost
Dude why are you wasting time and not doing the work you were elected to do?
I doubt that most liberals could understand his tax returns since they involve work, jobs, & non-government income...that sort of stuff.
18 million retweets - really? Either not really interested in @realDonaldTrump returns or @RonWyden is a buffoon or both. I'm going w/ both.
Jesus...I know you're on your 93rd vacation this year, but don't you have work to do for the people of the United States?
Retweeted ... just in case,  you know.
Bro.... you look desperate lol 18 million re-tweets, you have no chance.
Subpoena his tax returns and Donald will resign.
nope in a Yuge Bigly way
He won't do it - no matter what. He has too much to hide! I want to see them, though!
. Ain't gonna happen. Get over it.
He's promised so many times already
Taxpayers witness the ULTIMATE corruption of 'self dealing' by a POTUS n modern era toutin tax reform NOT knowing if its SELF DEALING REFORM
Nah. @realDonaldTrump is too afraid to release his tax returns.

WELL, MAYBE, IF OBAMA RELEASE'S HIS COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS, AND A REAL BIRTH CERTIFICATE .
NO... RELEASE YOURS FIRST
Only if you say what specifically you are searching for since UNREASONABLE searches i.e. Fishing expeditions by government are not good.
Do 18 million people even use twitter?
This isn't going to work & nothing will!
Trump obviously has something very incriminating in his tax returns & he will never release them!
Trump complied with Law already. Politicians that become multi millionaires during or after holding office should stand further scrutiny.
No, but you will totally get Mar-a-Lago chicken nuggets that may or may not have salmonella.
No matter what the Swamp King says it is potentially a lie you can count on. The only way he will ever release his tax returns if by force.
No DonTheCon won't. He's a shyster who doesn't want America to see he's not nearly as rich as claimed. #DonTheCon #Putin'sPuppet
@duckhunter9090 @realDonaldTrump no, because that would show he lied about selling his stocks, among other things
Russia and Syria has dictatorship. So almost every country has a dictator.
If he releases his tax returns it's over for him
Cc @pattonoswalt
Nothing would make him release his tax returns on his own.
RETWEETING! #taxreturns
He cant release his tax returns!Too mny Russian ties in supplment docs!We need 2 Protest ThiefTrump cause we go 2 jail if we dontdo taxes!18
Duh. Already done. 
Spoiler: No.
Why were his tax returns not mandatorily reviewed before he was POTUS? Make this a law!
No, he won't but I'll retweet it anyway.
He will lie about doing it if you get 18mil retweets.
@BillionairesNo No...he won't.
If my reply gets 18 million, will you resign, you hack?
