@SenateDems you passed obama care and didn't know what was in it and said we have to pass it to find out go blow smoke
"Oligarchy" defined
@McConnellPress - This is my Senator @RonWyden who represents & debates on my behalf.  Now please be human enough 2! let him C ur #Trumpcare
So very sad the words 'secret' & 'denial of adequate healthcare' are used when speaking of both North Korea and today's GOP #onceGOP no #RED
Well played!
Thank you for standing up and speaking out on the floor today. I'm as loud as I can be but will keep it up until we are heard by the @gop
#showusthebill
We appreciate your efforts to #HOLDTHEFLOOR #NoBillNoVote #noAHCA #notonestepback @SenateGOP is killing Americans! #murderers #RESIST
Maybe if you donate to McConnell's re-election campaign, he'll let you look at the bill, too.  #ShowUsTheBill #whatsthespeakerafraidof
Good thinking!
How does an entire party loose their moral compass? I really don't get it.
Somebody, please explain how passing this bill helps the GOP politically. Seriously, I'm at a loss. It's like they're asking to be voted out
they don't need more support, they can pass enough voter-disenfranchisement bills to stay in power permanently at this point
I hope you're joking. Do they believe in democracy for only certain people (as in the old days when only landowners were allowed to vote)?
#ShowUsTheBill #Resistance #TrumpRussia #ItsMuellerTime.
Will the bill have the names if the sponsoring donors and lobbyists ala NASCAR? #paytoplay #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you Senator Wyden!
Thank you for fighting for us
On their watch! People don't forget 
#OnTheirWatch
thank you & keep fighting for transparency.
Where's a Leaker when you really need one? #ShowUsTheBill
There it is.  That's who congress works for...donors and lobbyists.
Nice one!
Thank you for speaking. Thank you for weekly email updates! Appreciated.
STOP INCITING FEAR AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU GET PAID TO NEGOTIATE. WYDEN IS JUST ANOTHER LAZY POLITICIAN
Sure. Dems have never withheld info from us.  "...we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it..." —Nancy Pelosi
Maybe the hole "draining the swamp" was meant to be "expanding the swamp"
thank you Ron!
As an Oregonian, I'd like to thank Ron Wyden for doing what he can,not only for Oregonians, but for all citizens.
#ShowUsTheBill #Trumpcare
confused as2 why Republicans meeting in secret I thought congress consisted of more than 1 party Separation division getting worst
You of all people should know , we have to pass it before we can read it.
Go get 'em, Senator!
It's the Russianisation of American democracy
@Honey17011 WHERE'S THE "JUSTICE"? GOP HAVE RUSSIAN TIES UP THE ASS, AND "SUPER RICH" "LOYAL DONORS"! THIS IS NOT "WINNING"! 
Why are lobbyists allowed to be so chummy & have so much access? It is the people's house, not the chosen one's house!
Apparently, Americans didn't chip in enough to get transparency to one of our biggest expenses
Senator, THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK!  I'm in New York state but I am so proud to have you as a Senator for all Americans! You are awesome!
This should be illegal!
McConnell has gotten away w this sort of dispicable & unAmerican behavior far far too long.  He is no patriot.
@RonWyden we're counting on you
Please, HOLD THE FLOOR!
WTF? Donors & lobbyists? Not even patient advoacy groups? Very mitch slimy mcconnell thing to do.

But democrats and "We the People" don't have a right to see it??
Number of your caucas members have been talking about it. I don't know why u don't have it. Maybe u misplaced it. Schumer may let u read his
in other words, those who stand to make $ get to know, but the 23M citizens who would lose insurance get to be kept in the dark.
the founding Fathers of this country should be rolling in their graves the way the politicians are ruining the USA.   Its Embarassing.
It's a bill for donors/lobbyists, not we the people. Our premiums will keep ins. companies fat while we're denied.
than why do the insurance cos prefer the ACA? Think
As long as they please the 1%, they don’t care! They only update those who pay to play! #ShowUsTheBill
Didn't the GOP say the same thing back in 2010?
@GeorgeTakei all elections should be publicly funded. Health care should be a right of citizenship like every civilized nation has

Seems the administration could learn a thing or two about leak management from the Senate GOP.
This is a giant hate crime. They have no shame nor care about the blood on thier hands. #Trumpcare to cull the masses & Tax break for the 1%
What have you done to make America great today?
Media with audio/visual gag for a week. Not a coincidence
Wouldn't matter if it was in front of you. You hate it, will resist it and continue to destroy the Republic. Fool.
How about "follow the money"? Clearly the @GOP is responding only to the wealthy. Blue collar GOP voters, GOP does not care about you.
You all realize if over 50 u will get a 67% premium increase. 5 X. Versus 3 X it is simple math people wake up
You are being screwed!
It is clear. The GOP doesn't work for the American people and neither does Donald Trump. Democrats are the only ones holding on to democracy
They know we will vote them out if it's horrendous so why they're hiding it must mean they don't want riots
@GeorgeTakei #ShowUsTheBill
House Republicans are promoting Dictatorship,  Looking to remake US into Russian.  Keep stalling and protecting Putin/Trump @Impeach_D_Trump
Don't get your panties in a bunch, they'll hammer something out that's acceptable in oh 5-8 months.
Or 8 months or a year.
get on those lists so you can find out what is in it
Your recent tweets indicate you HAVE all the details already. Right?
Thank you so much for your efforts. We fully support you. #ShowUsTheBill
#fakenews
we have OHP who cares? #oregon #Healthcare
Yeah, they wouldn't want to piss off those donors and lobbyists with surprises they wouldn't approve of.
This is so criminal it boggles the mind. Everything the GOP is doing boggles the mind. So many crimes; where does it end?
It ends when you VOTE THEM OUT
Until then the hits just keep on comin'
@SpeakerRyan is a lying sack of !  @SenateMajLdr is no better.
Don't worry it's not done. Unlike u passing yours b4 reading it
We all know what will happen.  Americans get screwed and insurance makes a lot of money
Oh boy I am glad the lobbyists are getting updates!
GD outrageous!!!!
Got to pass it to know what's in it.Where did i hear that hmmm
Maybe if Dems worked with Republicans instead of obstructing and constantly bitching...
What I love about right-wingers is your heroic way of ignoring your party's behavior for the past 8 years to try to make your point.
@SenateDems @mattyglesias Its all about money for the insurance companies
@SenateDems @mattyglesias y do we need health insurance from insurance agency 2make them rich, y can't we pay dr or hospital
GOP, PUT YOUR BIG GIRL PANTIES ON AND FACE THE MUSIC. YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SHARING INFO WELL WITH OTHERS. YOU NEED A TIMEOUT.
Whoa; that freakin sucks!
When legislation like this is signed, nationwide protests ensue.
The Russians have it
We have to pass it so you can find out whats in it.
Its where your head is.
Why aren't all congressional democrats holding a mass press conference to protest this? Sit in on WH lawn?
They are
They are being helpful unlike you the person we hired to help.  #passthebill
You'll get it after it's drafted.  You act like a rookie senator.
Thank you, Senator! #ShowUsTheBill already, @GOP
You'll get as much time to review it as Republicans had to review Obamacare.
#ShowUsTheBill
Why weren't you asking these questions when the Democrats were doing the same thing with obamacare?
Thank you for prioritizing healthcare in your interviews! #TrumpRussia is crucial; the #AHCA fight is most pressing
Mueller is on the job!
When will Trump be subpoena?
Trump agreed to testify under oath. Trump gave no specific to which agency. Every investigating agency can demand his testimony under oath. 
@TitusNation Hey wait!  I thought Trump was AGAINST lobbyists?!  It's almost like that was a LIE or something!
Where are the LEAKERS?  We need some national hero to step up today and LEAK the bill to all Americans!
Dumb thinking.
seems like they aren't updating people in their own party as well! c.c. @senategop
Is the bill officially finished at this point?
No.Dems just making noise because they have nothing to offer.
Donors and Lobbyists get updates but not the citizens. Arrogant fools. @freedomcaucus @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
You'll get just as much time to review it as Republicans had to review obamacare.
Not true - ACA was debated; added close to 200 Republican amendments - was scored by CBO 11/2009, & not passed until March 2010.
There's no good reason to talk to Republicans. They just lie.
Hopefully that means leaks.
