Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!
Not to mention his quaint little anecdote is false.
DT is a lier an has no morals
Not to mention that the US was the invading imperialist power and the Muslims were defending their homeland.
This coming from the man that backs killing babies up until the day they are born, and legalization of narcotics, heroin, meth, crack, etc..
Oregon has made personal possession of hard drugs a misdemeanor. This is not legalization. As for women's rights:
I see you block people that support our President..So Patriotic..Got some news for you. TRUMP IS YOUR PRESIDENT
No he is not. He may be your president but I will never accept a Russian stooge running the country whose military I once served.
Your abrasive "ignorance is bliss" obstruct anything thats good 4 our country & not offer constructive ideas attitude is sinking your ship
@realDonaldTrump is the one who needs to study General Pershing since he continually gets his history wrong.
I believe trump is confusing General Pershing with Keyser Söze
Trump is about as suited for the job of President as Al Capone.  He really needs to RESIGN NOW or be Impeached. #FNC @CNN @MSNBC
Can't you guys gag him or something? He shouldn't be allowed out without a keeper.
Impeach him now. He is unstable and a danger not just to our way of life but all life.
@realDonaldTrump they wouldn't be prisoners, they would be hostiles
It appears we're in the very type of times that Germans were in back in the 30s,,, the times we often ask, why didn't they do something?!
Thank you for representing logic, reason, and equality. Proud you are representing Oregon and standing for all US.
So General Pershing is a murderer??? Take down his statues!!!
#ImpeachTrump
U yourself promote terrorism by wanting and lettings radical Muslims come to this country
Ron, you are a national treasure. Thank you!
Your support for Israel also helps terrorist recruiting
What are you doing to stop terrorism? Tweeting?
State of emergency in Oregon. Evacuation orders in place & this is what you're working on? You're not helping your constituents. #MilliFire
Not sure what you think he can do?
Not sure why it concerns you, being you're in Phoenix and not a constituent.
DT lies make up his on history
Someone should talk to @realDonaldTrump abut how well #abugraib worked out.
I believe that's exactly what his intentions are. Remember, only Trump can save us, therefore we need things to be saved from.
Do you think treating them like hotel guests deters them?
Wait and see what happens when he gets to prison!

This is a FAKE story!
Censure
Common Con.  You promote the idea that it's ok for US citizens to be victims of illegal alien crime with your open border agenda.
Actually it has the opposite effect?
Good point!
Let's offer them milk and cookies so they'll like us 
Not to mention that what he said isn't true. But the, what IS true from him? 
Yawn! Stop being predictable and wrong
Trump when you use "Study" and "History" to plug your Tweets. You know very little of either Word. You are truly the most IgnorantPOTUS EVER
@RonWyden  let's get busy getting trump out of office rather than arguing with his insanity! #ImpeachDonaldTrump
Absolutely Ron Wyden!  Thanks for your Voice Of Sanity!

Kind of like the death penalty?
That is one of the most foolish things you've ever said on Twitter, and that means it's near the top of a long list.
That point of course, is beyond trumps mental capabilities.. same with torture..
This is in reference to a discredited tale that Pershing covered Muslims in blood. Fake news from fake Prez whining about fake news.
It would be nice if a Senator would go on record correcting the false history put forth by Trump.
Terrorists should be shot.  What do you suggest?  Giving them free pass?
I thought you were talking about real threat by #Alt-Left Did you denounce & address violence on the left yet? 
Another deranged, violent leftist arrested for making death threats against a Republican Senator! #LockHimUp 
#ImpeachDonaldTrump #ImpeachPenceToo
Also: http://www.snopes.com/rumors/pershing.asp …
Trump posts fake history. Puts us and our military in more danger
That's the idea.
Along with inciting Americans to do violence against Muslims. Horrible.
The Piece of Trump is exactly what the terrorist have recruited on all along. SAD!
Its his plan @RonWyden why its time to impeach...he just likes his title..he does not care about america in any way shape or form
How about the Democratic senator who wants president Trump assassinated?
It just goes to show he is too mentally incompetent to  hold a crayon much less POTUS & way to dangerous to everyone!! He's got to go!!!
Please do what you can to remove @POTUS from office! He's destroying our country! #ImpeachTrump #25Amendment
And hopefully more calls for #ImpeachTrump.
Not to mention the fact that Pershing never did that. More alt right "facts"
Pretty sure that's the point Ron 
He didn't say that. Can you read?
He isn't smart enough to realize that.
Maybe, just maybe, encouraging more terrorists is the desired outcome. Of a piece with his other incitements to violence.
I think he really wants things to turn violent! He feeds off of it.
What the hell have you down since 2001 to shut down Gitmo?
Not only that it's a fuc**** war crime
@realDonaldTrump 
It's also a bullshit story.
Thank you for what you do for PDX. This man is unhinged and wants genocide. Please do something to get him out of office
Were very lucky to have @SenJeffMerkley and @RonWyden as our senators. Pressure needs to be applied to @HouseGOP to have @POTUS impeached.
Please RT and donate to https://publicgood.com/org/life-after-hate-inc/campaign/help-life-after-hate-fight-on … … … they were defunded by @SebGorka and offer people a path to leave hate groups #Resist
