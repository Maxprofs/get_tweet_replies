Thank you Senator!!!  Get em!
didnt you just legalize cocaine and heroin in your state n now u cry about health care.. u are a fricken fool,no wonder Oregon is a failure
they didn;t legalize cocaine and heroine
#NiceTry Oregon bill decriminalizes possession of heroin, cocaine and other drugs
Where in that article does it mention legalization? Only decriminalization, a good step forward towards legalization, which is ideal imo
Shows how ignorant you are then.
Are you trolling? or are you legit calling me ignorant for saying decriminalization is different from legalization
it does not matter tool looking the other way on it is just shoving the problem under the rug.
drug users do not deserve prison
knock them out
No matter what happens the American people thank u for all u have done. U are a true hero!
Thanks Senator Wyden
Keep up the great work protecting Oregonians! Thank you for fighting! #resist

Hey @RonWyden did they bring beer this time to celebrate the downfall of America?
