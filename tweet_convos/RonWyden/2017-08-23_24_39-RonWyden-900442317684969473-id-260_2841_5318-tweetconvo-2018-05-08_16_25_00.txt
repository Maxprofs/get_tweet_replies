If Trump pardons this man and sanctions this brand of lawlessness, he will again be endorsing white supremacy and attacking the rule of law.
What was @BarackObama endorsing when he freed Bradley Manning, and traded 5 of the worst terrorists in the world for a traitor?

Shit show cousin????  Carl
Agreed. Agree or disagree with his practices as Sheriff, his conviction was for contempt of court. Not ever tolerable from a sheriff.
# corrupt courts disobeying Federal laws???
Law enforcement was doing their job, unlike the courts!
#TrumpCrimeFamily are a clear and present danger to USA - Russians are calling shots to disrupt domestic tranquility with KKK & #NKoreaWar
# no proof.  Create havoc in your own country.
What country would that be? You know when Putin is controlling voting machines US doesn't have a govt worth a mcdonald's cup of coffee right
You sir are a joke!
he was set up by the previous  administration.
And the disrespectful lawless fake president wants to rubber stamp his behavior. In a power grabbing move to undermine our system of justice
He won....  our little losers don't get participation trophies and they are mad
# do your job Ron....  budget deficit , education, passing better healthcare...  tax reform....  you should be voted out
Are we now ruled by courts?  Isn't Portland a 'sanctuary city,' in violation of our Constitution? That doesn't bother you? Strange. @POTUS
Haha! You cant even respect the voters choice under law. Why do you hold others to different standards. I wont even bring up CROOKED HILARY.
Its a damn good thing because you sound just ad bad as trump!!!compared to him she is an angel! !!
A fallen Angel maybe.
Have you been in a coma for the last 8 years? Ever hear about Eric Holder's DOJ? Is a lawless DOJ run by Dems less threatening? #TermLimits
And judges legislating from the bench totally DESTROY the foundations of our republic!
Were you outraged to learn the IRS was targeting certain political groups?
Joe Arpaio is beloved by America and followed the law to the nth degree.. illegal aliens cannot overrule Federal Immigration Law. #PardonJoe
Skin color has nothing to do with legal status little girl
And that is why Trump likes him. Trump would love to do the same but he can't. Would be nice if he actually read the Constitution. Or read.
Where did you go to get your MBA. Genuis
Please stop the nonsense the real voters know sheriff joe was a target of the former administration because he thoroughly enforced the law.
"Real voters"? That's the most un-American thing I've heard all month and it's been a banner month.
Your interpretation is appreciated but not accurate. The sheriffs voters know the truth of why a long dedicated public servant was set up
Set up? He's was the one doing it. Come on.
OMG!  Can't believe you even tweeted this. Oregon's last 3 Govs refuse to obey the law on capital punishment. Silence from @RonWyden
What does the death penalty have to do with racial profiling?
Not following the law. Try to keep up. If you claim one and ignore the other, you're a hypocrite
We were discussing Arpaio's defiance of a completely unambiguous court order, so spare us your whataboutisms.
Disobeying the law is disobeying the law. It's cool until the person disobeying you don't agree with
So all disobeyals of law by government officials fall neatly into the same category?
And Oregon becoming a sanctuary state???? Breaking that law is ok???
Govt is unraveling.  All 3branches following their own agendas instead of following the will of the ppl.
The judiciary is not supposed to follow the will of the people. They are to follow the rule of law.
Jefferson >
I think people should look at pres clinton's and pres obama's pardons. Then a long time sheriff's pardon is pretty nominal.
But sanctuary cities are ok?
How do you feel about Oregon law enforcement being forbidden from enforcing the law then?
How are law enforcement personnel in Oregon "forbidden from enforcing the law"?
HB3464 signed by Gov. You can look it up.

How about states & cities harboring, aiding & abetting illegal aliens? They literally prevent police from doing their job.
Law enforcement standing down while protestors get get bloodied and murdered in Portland & Charlottesville, why? 

Two Dem mayors.
At least 100 Democrat sanctuary city mayors have taught us that laws are mere suggestions. Following the law is optional.
Get over yourself and your grandstanding.
The judge refused defendant's case to be heard by a jury!!!!  What a sham& your statement is as big of a farce.   You're a liar & a buffoon
bullcrap
He was rail roaded

Race-baiting Ron/Dems like their illegal vote. Arpaio convicted by Obama judge for targeting illegals. They were committing a crime! #Oregon https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/900443042607443968 …
Gee Ron, BHO released murders & rapists loose on our citizens.  That was law abiding?  How many 1,000s of those kind were there?
I came from Italy became us citizens in 1974. The law is if you are in this country with out papers u need to go.If not y did have too.
We Democrats always struggle with our weight, because we can talk and eat out of both sides of our mouth. Obey the law or break it?
You people! I swear! Strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!
So only Dems and liberals get to choose which laws they want to ignore?
No Ron, Joe A obeyed the laws and an activist judge practiced his trade with extreme prejudice and disdain. You do same when you open mouth.
Liberal Courts not enforcing the constitution threatens the foundation of this country
Bull  it was all a politically motivated.
Kinda like this?
http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/29/three-year-amnesties-not-fully-rescinded/ …
That's what half of the gov does everyday and you have the balls to call out another person?? What abt sanctuary cities?? Speak !!!
Liberals who refuse to abide by the FEDERAL sanctuary city laws should go to jail
Like our state refusing the written law to assist feds to deport illegal immigrants?
These 'victims' you speak of suffered what exactly?
They produced valid identification when requested.
That's IT!
What was the #crime again?
Courts and out of control politicians threaten public order when they allow lawless sanctuary cities, and order police to NOT do their job.
Do you think sanctuary cities are Okay?
Separation of powers. Executive vs. Judicial branches.
MLK once said "Remember, everything Hitler did was legal."
Sir this man, Arpaio.  Hes a is a murderer! My daughter was married to his chief deputy. He "told all", but they divorced. NO parole!
No- Democrats insistence on bipartisanship does
"Law enforcement refusing to obey the courts threatens the foundations of our republic."

Sounds like sanctuary cities, doesn't it, chief?
Worry about Oregon and the abortions at nine months. Its vile. Do something about that.
Isn't this a constitutional violation? "threatens the foundation of our republic" But you're ok with this??
One does NOT have to obey an order that violates the #Constitution Confiscating guns is clear violation! #MAGA #RedNationRising #2A
Kinda like the Hillary issue... FBI refused to obey the law ... pot / kettle #MAGA
U know, nobody knows exactly what happened. The Rep (ie Trump train) have run with the idea that comey let her off for no reason. Do u think
MAYBE just fucking maybe it was lack of evidence?? No nobody even can use thir tiny brains, Trump is a damn train wreck & its but her emails
Care @ is Benghazzi & emails- & most dont have any facts on either bc they listen to 2 primary news sources or Infowars! U know Jesus sd the
Devil was the King of Lies- well I think that describes DT pretty well - i didnt know that til I watched Bill Maher.  So get over it & focus
On whats happening now Not 8-12 months ago! #ImpeachTrump #TrumpCrimeFamily #ResignTrump #NOTMYPRESIDENT #TrumpLies #Liarinchief
What about Obama refusing to enforce immigration and deportation laws and encouraging cities to do the same? What laws can I ignore? Taxes?
This hypocrite spewing about arpaio refusing to obey and white supremacist yet he endorses sanctuary cities and states.
Wyden is a pussy.  He's unethical, a liar and needs a lesson in civics.
Refusing to enforce immigration laws threatens the foundation of our republic, and lowers wages for 50M, but keeps Soros, your master, happy
bs they railroaded the man for doing his job. You are the problem in America today. Arpaio will speak of the unbelievable injustice soon
And he cost the taxpayers of Maricopa county $28 mill and counting in legal costs to defend his unconstitutional behavior. Shameful
This^. He was not convicted for doing his job. He was convicted for going outside the law and claiming THAT was his job.
Bullshit.  Then, why did the judge not allow a jury trial?
That I'm not sure of.
Courts and corrupt Judges ignoring established Law threatens the foundation of our Republic.
45 the Criminal is just abt to prove he hates the Constitution too.
For a POTUS to even think about supporting this, it's unconscionsable!
You need to remember you're not from that state. AZ is over run by illegals, he followed the federal laws regarding illegals.
So does a pres?????
But you're totally cool w/ sanctuary cities NOT following Federal Law YOU make people less safe #YourStupidisShowingRon
State what specific law he broke! He was not allowed a jury trial. That law was broke. You should know better you twit!
Wyden doesn't care about truth.
And you are equally upset with sanctuary cities?
Kind of the same goes on when Law Enforcement fails to follow Federal Laws concerning Illegal Refugees in Sanctuary cities 
The courts don't make the laws congress does. Sheriff was obeying the law unlike criminal sanctuary cities.
while I dont agree-the facts say thus.
And this is why Donald supports Joe. He wants the same backing from all local PDs
Here Senator concentrate on one of you own that you and the msm have conveniently overlooked
Judicial activism, the courts ordering law enforcement to ignore lawlessness, threatens the foundations of our Republic.
Pardoning a condemnor shows utter contempt for the judiciary.
Many judges are making up laws as they go.
Mr. Wyden, judges legislating from bench tramples constitution americans have fought and died for. Joe targeted by left for doing job well.
Liberals are insane hypocrites picking and choosing which laws to follow and ignore while pointing fingers at those who actually follow them
.You don't like the truth, huh?

You mean like when the liberal judges that refused to follow executive orders, even though the law states they should follow it?
The same courts that pretend gay marriage & open borders are in the constitution?

Screw 'em. They deserve no loyalty.
Liberal judges that don't follow the law or apply it equally to all citizens threaten the foundations of our Republic.
So you didn't have a problem with Obama telling law enforcement to ignore federal law but you do with Arpaio.  Hypocrite much.
Sheriff Joe was following the letter of the law! He pissed obama off. That's why he was in trouble. FOR NO OTHER REASON 
at least he follow the immigration laws some thing you don't.He did nothing but protect against criminal illegals who are not wanted
- you stand for Sanctuary cities, which is completely illegal. Either you're a hypocrite, or monumental liar. I say both.
The courts, mayors, governors are refusing to obey the President we elected...does that threaten our foundation? Or do you make exceptions?
#Comey #lynch #Hillary #obama ring a bell!?! Just the tip 
Joe Arpaio was following the US Immigration Law on books. Obama administration ignored those laws-Sanctuary Cities do same.Hypocrite
When the courts are not following the law the police have a duty to uphold it and so he did. The courts have been politicized (corrupted).
so are the mayors!
And that's why T loves him so much.... 
And still Arpaio claims he did nothing wrong.
TREASON, SEDITION, AND SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES
Tweet could also say: sanctuary cities refusing 2 obey fed law threatens the foundation of our republic.
Joe Arpaio would have been the first one to throw someone in jail that did not obey a court order.
Get this shit show out of the people's house
@AthansChristi Pathetic
A pardon will alienate/offend every Judge and Court official in the Country, as it should. This is what DT wants? Simply to satisfy base?
It's a big deal, and also sanctions abuse by those charged to protect us.  Trump only understands 'unfair' when it relates to him.
What do you call what Chelsea Manning did?
Ron's worried abut Foundation our Republic? Obama releases Islamic Terrorists who Beheaded Americans! No Problem!
Could we just we just report him
Deport
Ignorant statement.  Have another drink.
Wrong Rod.  It was a Barry O witch hunt....
your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost
Arpaio doing his job is an attack on your democratic voting block! Which is why all you dems are in a tissy!
Where have you been? Courts mal-legislating &refusing to obey the Constitution while Congress ignored all already destroyed the republic...
Trump perverts everything... he undermines all existing legitimate authority... wants abnormal control... will abuse his authority...
Thank you for putting it so clearly.
He is an avid #45 supporters! Following the rules of law and honesty eludes these people! Which also guarantee's him the right to be freed!
But he was racist to brown people, and that makes him just great in Trump's book.
You are ignorant!  How do you know he was racist to "brown" people? Asking for a brown person.
The law was broken when those folks decided to sneak into our country uninvited. This happened under your watch. MAGA
he wanted his own guantanamo, like manus island...nazi concentration camp R&D
Congress, refusing 2 obey the US Cons. (unfit pres.) threatens the very, VERY like, literally, *THE* Foundation of US. & destabilizes world.
President "Law and Order" at it again.
You are pathetic Wyden. When are you going to retire?
A felon such as the ex-sheriff felt he is above the law and SHOULD NOT BE PARDONED. This is not his 1st time for disobeying the courts
The court abused its power AND refused a jury trial.  A violation of the constitution.
U are so unbelievable puppet! Still no independent thought or proper proposals to help legislate change for the people of this country!

The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Dictators: https://twitter.com/lonestarmomcom/status/900464631407357952 …
LOUDER PLEASE!
NO! That's what the liberal police & mayors are doing All over the country for the likes of antifa & black lives matter hate groups.
trump professes to be the "Law & Order President", but his support for a convicted criminal/former sheriff belies that self proclamation.
He's a FRAUD!
Him, Hillary and Obama are all frauds. Obama condemns the killings of black men but turns around and sign into law....
for law enforcement to have the right to shoot anyone "if they fear for their lives" , while permitting the practice of police arresting...
low income people without evidence, but just say so, while wealthy walks away from a mountain of evidence...
because it is the middle class to wealthy that donates to the DNC, and they can afford to bring a lawsuit against the police.
So you are ok with cities ignoring federal immigration law?
That is exactly what I was thinking!
And having and idiot @POTUS condone this says it all
DT thinks laws are only for 'other s' don't believe that they alloy to him. Just like bills...no I don't have to pay! Rules laws moral DT NO
I believe congress already allowed that to happen to . This isn't working anything like a republic anymore.
Wish I were in Oregon so I could vote for Wyden
Joe did not break FEDERAL Law but the wusses here in Phoenix can't take it.
Umm, unless the officers immigration training and Federal permission, they were breaking federal law.
He belongs in jail
Jealous because your a coward and couldn't EVER do anything because it's the right thing? No, you only follow along doing what your told.
Has there ever been a pardon of a person who was found guilty of contempt of court?
And tRump loves him for it
@realDonaldTrump 
LAW & ORDER HUH!!!!
Only when he & his supporters agree with the law or it's application. In other words, they cry when they don't get their way.
Or lawyers giving shitty advice? Or activist judges? All 3 are equally as plausible Senator. #maybe #all3suck
The real threat to our country is a court system that makes decisions based on political issues not on constitutional grounds, that happened
With presidential pardons, trump can ignore the judiciary.
Pardoning him will be saying "I'm a racist and stand by other racists" loyalty over morality. We are screwed. Hurry Mueller!
When did you lose your soul?
i think you're trying too hard.
Have you liberals forgotten Obama pardoned more people than any other president, most of which were drug dealers and gang banging thugs?
Sanctuary Oregon:Judges let Prisoners escape out Court's Back door & Sheriffs let Wanted Illegals loose to rape & rob & beat Oregon women!
Law enforcement refusing to enforce immigration laws is a direct threat to OUR republic. Youre ignorantly hypocritical,so is @KateBrownForOR
"little t" Violated & Continues 2 Violate His Oath Of Office Many Times Each Day. Has Anyone got a Listing of these violations?
Yes, and disrespecting the judiciary is a very Trumpian thing to do. In Trump's view,  #SheriffJoe probably just defied a "so-called" judge.
Joe tried to get dirt on the judges wife in order to blackmail him. Sick man.
Then someone needs to hold 45 accountable last night he basically promise to Pardon him.
The asshat in chief knows another asshat when he sees one
"little t" LOVES ANYONE WHO REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF LAW OR COURT ORDERS B/C THAT's WHAT HE's DONE HIS ENTIRE LIFE? 1)
But it's ok for Santuary Cities...??? You are disgusting.
Although Trump has the constitutional authority to grant this pardon. When does it become an abuse of that authority.
To paraphrase: How many troops does Justice Roberts have again?
Under the guise of racism disrespect Judicial System. Which no offense all the American People have had to rely on given apathetic Congress
And that is why Trump supports him
indeed :(
Keep him locked up and disgraced.  Racism with a badge.
And the insane wants to know why blacks and Latinos dont trust the system.
A nation of men not laws is the road to hell!
Too bad you didn't feel the same when Obama was ignoring immigration laws & rewriting laws from the Executive Branch with his pen and phone.
Law enforcement, lol, and Courts do as the please. Serve n Protect. NOT. Judges make up law as they go. Ignore what they want. Money talks
It seems to me that YOU have a poor understanding of the law &"ignore what u want" if u think that's what typically happens, esp. in courts
The system is broken. You can not AFFORD a atty they do give you one. One that works with and for that Judge everyday. Good luck.
No, Mr. Paranoid, the atty does NOT work for judges; they have a duty to their client,&they take that seriously(their careers are at stake).
Public Defenders do work in The same courtroom with the same JUDGES.  As I said can't afford $ atty you get theirs
Working in same courtroom isn't working "for" the judges; they work for their clients, not judges. Judges don't pay them. Ignorancefear
The public defender's office is funded thru legislature, not judges. Some defenders are private attys appointed for just 1 indigent client.
My father was told by 3 attys  he could not afford that no atty. Nor public defender in his county would work for him. Misdamieners at that.
45 pardoning him is a clear sign 45 doesn't respect the laws this country was founded on.
Everything Trump has done, lifelong, has proved his disdain for the law.
Any presidential pardon is a disdain for the law, or just Trump's?
This particular pardon is a disgrace
Arpaio had a job to do.. You wouldn't have the juevos for
We call these political prisoners in other countries and this is exactly what he is.
Jails full of ppl for small crimes, & TRUMP may pardon sheriff who abused power 2 put them there. TRAGIC abuse of power 4 poltical reasons.
Bullshit
Is this why DT appears to defend this sheriff???Defiance maybe??
A presidential pardon would be a dangerous precedent that friends of DJT are beyond law enforcement. Abuse of power. Impeachable.
Did you see all the criminals Obozo pardoned, scumbag?
Let's see, the choice was follow the law or follow the court that wasn't following the law. Though choice.
You are absolutely correct!
That's the best news I've heard since I heard Donald J Trump beat Hillary R Clinton for the Presidency of the United States !
Political courts is the real problem!
What are you trying to say?
Trump promoting law Breaking is ok. Imagine our streets in a free for all
Duterte would be proud.
Joe is a standup constitutional sheriff. To bad all sheriffs don't uphold the constitution.
Only the federal government can enforce federal law.  It's too bad that most "constitutionalists" have never actually read the Constitution.
County, building block, sheriff, highest voted official uphold the constitution not statutes and amendments read it yourself. Educate self!!
I am educated. That's why I'm aware that the Constitution doesn't give state and county officials the power to enforce federal law.
MSM EXPLOIT DEATH OF WOMAN& PRESSURE TRUMP-2END FREESPEECH OBAMAS DONOR BUSSD IN ANTIFA/BLM 2 LEGAL RALLY HIT WOMEN IN HEAD W BIKE LOCKS OK?
He obeyed the laws- unlike sanctuary city, states and the court you are speaking of -the courts don't make the laws. Don't try to confuse
Joe has put his life in service of our country and you liberals are witch hunting a good honest man but follow the devil killary off cliff
it sounds like you are advocating those who run our cities to break the law by being a sanctuary city!
Well, Ron you made your first mistake when talking about the foundation of our Republic!!! The Liberals have changed that to a Democracy.
A democracy means every citizen votes a republic means we elect officials to bote on our behalf... still very much a republic
Not even close DA!
Care to educate me?
Educate yourself fool!
You see thats funny bc I did do some quick googling, and i still cant really see what you're trying to say
Democracy = rule of the majority. Republic is where the the county and the state TRUMP the federal government.
We didn't want a king across the pond dictating to us. And we don't want the east and west cost liberals dictating to us Now!
What's your thoughts of Sanctuary cities ignoring federal immigration laws??? Huh?? Got zip on that dontcha sparky.. #IndentityPolitics
He upheld our laws, great Sheriff
