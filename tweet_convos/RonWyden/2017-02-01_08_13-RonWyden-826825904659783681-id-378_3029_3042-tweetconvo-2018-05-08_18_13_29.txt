Price's stock trades & the Qs we STILL don't have answers to undermine the belief he can work on behalf of the public interest & not his own
Mnuchin also misled the Committee on his shady foreclosure practices that forced many Americans, sometimes illegally, out of their homes.
I sincerely hope, for Americans' sake, @SenateGOP will put partisanship aside & join us in pressing for the answers.
The public deserves to know exactly who we are trusting with #Medicare & our economy.
Here are the questions @SenateFinance Democrats want answers to from Price & Mnuchin
Will the democrats introduce a bill that could allow us to move our 401k plans ?
That's because for the 1st time in history, partisan Sen Fin Cmte Dems boycotted 2 hearings in an attempt to obstruct 2 nominees.
@LibertyIsALady should have showed up to vote
They boycotted because they weren't getting ANSWERS from Price and Mnuchin.
this was disgraceful and anti-democratic.
aaaa they did it again!!!!!!!!
shameful what they do. Thankful that you are standing up to them
is a fool. Finance Cmte changed the rules which is akin to Dems instituting nuclear option for Obama.  Thanks #StupidOnPurpose
Y'all ready to go low yet? @RonWyden @SenateDems
Seriously. Rules no longer apply, Dems need to start taking drastic measures.
Dems need some creative, out-of-the box surprise measures. #DoTheUnexpected
Exactly.Something we can keep going continuously that Repubs can't fight.
Protocol is out the window. Time to do something unprecedented.
Just because you don't like the answer, it isn't misleading Watching you during the hearing is embarrassing and highly un-American
history will remember your @GOP colleagues as weak & corrupt. Thank you for all your work on behalf of all Americans. #corruption
@SenSchumer  It's your job to show up. You boycott and you get spanked. Poor thing!
Kinda along the same lines as what you did for Obama. Get in the game for making America Great - otherwise you're out.
Perhaps you should have attended then. It is you job after all, is it not?  Business continues despite toddler tantrums.
That's because Dems failed to show up for work again shame on them
@SenateDems Remember this day every time a Repub wants to cooperate. The high road is for suckers. #ResistTrump #JustSayNo
Get your story out! Good strategy,GOP pulled trick. Changed rules. U change rules so 24 hr notice must be given of rule changes.
@jricole and we'll bitch while they keep winning. Why does our side never do anything like this?
Time to start. Less Lena Dunham: more Jimmy Hoffa. Let's #ratfuck the @GOP into extinction.
(I mean I do like Lena too...hehe)
Our side didn't have this option! Do what? Dems minority, no filibuster, very few options.
right. I mean in general not just this vote
Very few options until we have majority. We gotta vote, put Dems in office.
Congrats to the cmte for getting something done despite your deplorable actions
What kind of Democracy is this if the Repubs keep violating & cheating Americans? @SpeakerRyan is an abomination & pig
we have no democracy anymore
they should put a sign on Statue of Liberty that says "Antique are from the former democracy"
this is outrageous.  Beginnings of tyranny.  Power is being consolidated and controlled by one group over all others.  Fight back!
Totally legal and unfortunately necessary to break through the grandstanding. @RonWyden
And you were totally ok w/8 yrs of GOP obstruction? Everything they do is necessary, but Dems grandstand?
The GOP activity was around SCOTUS (and not all), not the Obama cabinet. @hopvenom @RonWyden
you obviously missed the meeting elect night where GOP decided to obstruct anything Obama
Yes, it was so offensive that we collectively decided to change the tide in the house and senate. @50StateProgress @hopvenom
The GOP actions were so offensive that you did what?@eBSnider @50StateProgress @hopvenom
The attempts at thwarting the Constitution by Dems was so offensive that we reclaimed Congress. @50StateProgress @hopvenom
@senatedems Why the HELL r u working with the GOP/45? To them, facts don't matter, laws don't matter. They don't care if ur nice.
two words for you - Term Limits
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Wyden. I am now a " Gray Panther".
What are they doing?? Every day it's something new and terrible. Trump is not the only crazy person in DC. How do we stop the Rs?
Maybe Democrats should have showed up for work. You think?
What?  You don't like it when the GOP plays by Dems rules.  Can you say Harry Reid? I knew you could!  Whiners
what can I, as a voter, do about this?
I suspect lots more of that a'comin... Before americans rediscover voting.
@SenateDems show up to work please.  Your empty seats will happily be filled by republicans at next elections.
What will you do about it?
So proud of you for standing up to this regime. So glad you are my Senator.
Dems would have done it, too if they were in charge at the same level.  How do we fix it? #Midterm2018
It's time the Dems stand together against this maniac. Have you forgotten the last 8 yrs. Grow a pair & save our democracy.
You aren't telling the truth. You tried to block the Cmte's work by not showing up. The adults had to go on without you.
senator, really, first time ever on a partisan basis???....whadya call ACA??...
@SenateDems so do your job & stand up to them! #growaset
Good for them. The obstructionism has gone too far.
@SenateDems well maybe if you guys showed up they wouldn't have to do that you guys think we're stupid grow up
hoe did it work out?
"misleading"? I don't know, in my day we used to call it a lie.
Do everything you can to act against this ridiculousness, Senator. I know you're in the fight and I appreciate it. Keep going.
Honestly, what can we, you, or anyone do to stop GOP from forcing the other half of the nation to capitulate to their every whim?
But it is allowable, right? No recourse to this "1st time in history" move, right? Let that be a lesson and apply strategy (1)
from now on. t-hole co. certainly has the low rode all laid out. They fight dirty; the opposition fights dirtier! (2)
*and that should be ROAD.
STOP lying. YOUR simply WASTING taxpayers money by stalling and not showing up to vote. Get to work & MAGA & MASA.
JUST WRONG ,JUST LIKE YOU WERE WRONG TO DO NOTHING WHEN MED CUTS ARE KILLING OREGON DISIBLED,METAL ILL,ADDRESS OREGONS NEEDS 1ST
@conniewhitehome 
You say "misled".  I say they lied.
just a question but how many times has the minority party failed to show up for a vote on a nominee.
we support you senator. Thank you!!@pdxindivisible @Indivisible_OR
Is the senate just corrupt?? WHY??
I wonder if there are enough honest Republicans in the country to get rid of these partisan political hacks. Much silence...
jeez
Rupubicans are slime!
Thank you for being vigilant- for Oregonian and Americans.
Great to see your buddy @SenOrrinHatch speaking up (NOT!) on this catastrophe & other unAmerican issues the awful Pres is pushing
what about when Dirty Harry changed the rules.  Next time show up for work you are hack   Nothing more nothing less
block the scotus nom, keep investigating russia ties. Convince your colleagues to grow spines.
Not simply misled. They flat-out lied.
What's new, we are in dystopian times. Ignorance is Strength  times. War is Peace times. 
Do not go quietly in the night, speak!!
@klq727 If Dems would show up to work it would not have happened.
I guess the Dems should've shown up to the dance then!  Quit playing games and start acting like adults if you want a say...
I your constituent expect you to do everything in your power as my Government representive to stop @Potus and #UnholyTrinity
Fascism.
had it ever happened with one nominee?? Regardless it's an affront to the system. Keep up the fight, boss. Proud of you.
@theonlyadult @gop is equivalent of Nazi Party.  WAKE UP EVERYBODY!
@SenateDems I truly don't understand how this is legally possible.  What a shame.
In the new Rep bubble, misleading the committee, like plagiarism, is a job requirement.
@jillanne34 Republicans are power hungry and Americans will pay the price for this.
@SenateDems Lifelong Dem wishing my party was as badass as the opposition.
.@RonWyden they sure did. And as a pissed off constituent, I'd like to know what you're actually going to do about it.
@SenSchumer What despicable liars you both are.  Zhou lack the character to serve in the Senate.
@LiberalMunky You saw how @alfranken stood up to Cruz/Cornyn today. Not pretty but damn effective. Learn from it and get Crack in'
Mr Obama broke rule after rule after rule to push through ObamaCare, misleading the American people. What say you?
.@CNN @FoxNews @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi @RonWyden - That's right. You guys can't do anything! You guys are powerless. Deal with it! #MAGA
Hope now Dems understand that #resistance is the only way to deal w this crop of Rs. VOTE NO on cabinet, SCOTUS
@_Hope2017 Orin Hatch is as slimey as they come.
@2020VoteHillary Y isn't it a violation of our civil rite? Congress works 4 the ppl WHO elect them. We had no demo representation
that is outrageous
thank you
OMG, now what?
@2020VoteHillary If course they did.  Repubs cheat always
you mean when Dems broke the rules to vote in with 51 instead of 60 broke the rules.  Show up.
Today, you weren't there on this historic occasion, instead you decided to play hooky and missed the chance to vote.no.
@jimmyj48125 #ImpeachTrump #MuslimBan #resist #standingunited #TrumpRussia #Traitor Trump
AWOL NoShow  Wyden whines that after HE & Democrat Senators BOYCOTT Nomination Hearing that Republicans change the Rules!
@2020VoteHillary Obviously if Trump can't get what he wants the honest and Democratic way he bends the rules or breaks them.
@2020VoteHillary So lies don't matter.
While the children (Democrats) were having a temper tantrum the adults (Republicans) were doing the people's work!
we've come to expect nothing less from these hypocrites who pretend they are christians. They're evil; wolves in sheeps clothing
@tllanes yes, now what are you going to do about it?
Pro Tip; You'll miss 100% of the opportunities you don't show up for
@gsw7 Maybe you can just do everything in your power to shut the government down?
@KaraDemocrat Does misled mean LIE? If I "misled" under oath I'd wind up in jail.
- on your side 100%. But am i incorrect saying they did not BREAK the rules, but changed them?
terrible, thanks for standing up for us
No. This was overcoming Demoncrap obstruction using your own "Nuclear Option". So, suck it.
@RavMABAY crime pays in 2017
Stop playing softball with republican. Turn their playbook on them. Never forget Judge Garland. Give Gorsuch full McConnell!
If Dems had CLEARLY messaged delays were necessary DUE 2 LYING u cldve bought time but u let Repubs cast this as politics as usual
get out the word to vote Democrat in the 2018 midterm.
How can they do that? Aren't there RULES in place to prevent such a perversion of power?
@SenSchumer and they will be the first to bitch about bad behavior. I hope there are no more chances given here either.
@SenateDems what recourse is there to punish them for changing/breaking rules of government?
@SenateDems wrong and unamerican
The fucking Dems need to grow a pair and break all rules, keep eyes on Repubs 24/7 and chop Repubs' legs off and empty heads, too.
thank you and please keep fighting.
Don't forsake us, stand firm on ALL cabinet picks and vote NO!
Again, we are reminded of Democracy is three counterbalance systems, Admin. Legislative, Judicial. GOP is strangleholding them all
Were you there to do something about it?
.@RonWyden "misled committee" = perjury right? Shouldn't they be charged with a crime?
.@RonWyden @SenSchumer @maddow @AriMelber @JoyAnnReid Principled Senate Dems anxious re: "obstruction, hope you paid attention #CallIt
.@RonWyden @SenSchumer @maddow @AriMelber @JoyAnnReid Why did Sen. McConnell ask Senate Dems to “abide by rules” while Republicans refuse?
.@RonWyden @SenSchumer @maddow @AriMelber @JoyAnnReid Sir, wasn’t what those Cabinet nominees did LYING UNDER OATH? Perjury? #CallIt
if not working for us, who is he working for?
our entire system is so broken. This is so jacked up.
Reid did it in 2011, plus in entire history of US 168 cloture votes on nominees prior to NOV 13, during Barry, 82.
Misleading! You guys played hooky.  stop thinking people are dumb. We see whats going on. Just vote no, but vote.
keep fighting don't stay silent!!
teach you to show up - playing hooky isn't a strategy.  If your arguments weren't so weak you could sway people,but they are weak.
@SenSchumer They broke it...they bought it! Now we March! WeThePeople will prevail...We will vote them all out
Thanks for all you are doing to protect our democracy. I can't imagine the hours you are putting in. 
maybe show up and fight in the committee instead of sitting in the hall boycotting the meeting.
@SenateDems and you are a liar, they misled no one! #draintheswamp
Maybe you should have attended?
I have your ticket
Maybe time to impeach you cry babies for failing to perform your elected duty
@SenateDems Maybe, you should have shown up for the meetings, huh? This is what happens when you grandstand & it backfires.
First time in Finance Committee history Democrats haven't shown up for a vote. Americans don't want obstructionism.
@SenSchumer When the President lies, is corrupt, and authoritarian we see same from @SenateGOP. Not fulfilling checks/balances.
.  Good job az usual Ron. U are the best.
Interesting Where exactly do you reside NYC, Wash.DC.,or Oregon?
what is democracy?? I don't know anymore. Republican senators have no regard for the law
Why don't you focus on strengthening the dem bench and do it back to them when the tables are turned. You wouldn't. Dems are weak
@SenSchumer You guys are paid to go to work, not skip meetings.
How can u have a partisan basis if the other does not participate. You have a nerve to tweet this? Its dumb senator.
.@RonWyden If you don't want to show up and do your job, give your seat to someone else.
@WrightTownsend Actually they LIED to the committee but yes. #Resist
I'M GLAD DOPE THAT YOU LOST YOUR POWER - FIRST TIME A STUPID STUNT LIKE THAT WAS PERFORMED
They both lied to the committee. One committed Securities Fraud. The SEC should be alerted to investigate. If guilty jailed.
@iamforeverblue2 Unethical, Bannon is doing exactly what he said he'd do, now he president we are in 4 a hell of a ride.
Your boycott left them no choice. Continue your childish behavior & lose more Dem seats - guess 1,000 this election wasn't enough?

if in doubt, couldn't they have voted NO if they were to vote? Old adage: Not making a decision IS itself a decision.
Dems were trying to get them to answer more q's under oath so on record. GOP pulled trigger. 'No' vote pointless.
I see! But we're dealing with results-oriented too aren't we? And not just words but actions? Right?
Just hope us Dem voters understand what results are available. GOP can confirm everyone on their own.
... The gap has become a chasm...
If we are all still alive for primaries, 2018 election - WE GOTTA VOTE. Our republic hangs in balance. #Impeach
#ResistOften starts today,as people. Vote but not just #voteandwait nor #waitandsee no #nexttime #TrustButVerify
it's not Superbowl, not #FinalFour it's environment, health, civil rights, voting rights, freedom of expression
@SenateDems Democrats should boycott entire House and Senate.
@WomenG4Hillary Where have the backbones of democrats gone? Why did we use this every time they obstructed justice?
Then it's time to fight back Senator. Filibuster him.
Will not B the last
Why follow news 
When they offer:
No real info, false stories, slanted views, hidden agendas?
#snowflakes Maybe you should have attended the hearing instead of sitting on the sidelines.
@SenSchumer @RonWyden they did not mislead tell the truth
Where are we on the Conflicts of Interest, Russian hacking? OBSTRUCT at every turn. we support you.
Seems to me hes oing to change w/ever he wants to GET w/ever wants and once they have Gorusch in, there'll be no recourse.
@lisafittko #tyrants
.@RonWyden @SSWorks another cut of the 1000 cuts coming to KILL OUR Democracy. 241 years is not long enough run
Ron, I guess you'll be really surprised when the GOP suspends the constitution @iamforeverblue2
actually it was the rules Harry Reid and Dems made during Obama Era. But you in the ass maybe show up next time
Broke the RULES????  You have a lot of nerve - Democrats consistently break every Rule of Law!
this is crazy and they need to be stopped and held accountable
You all need to call liars and cheaters out. No more nice PC words
@WomenG4Hillary 2 more people to impeach
if they thought it was important they should have showed up rather than letting them pull an obamacare
When you play stupid games, don't act so shocked at the results.
You Guys got outfoxed again.  I am ashamed!   No vote for SCOUS nominee for 12 mo. Good for Repubs. why not Dems?
@SenateDems They will be great for America. That's all that matters.
Nice guys finish last in Washington. I'm not sure how many times this needs to be proven to be the case.
well maybe next time, the people that had something better to do other then be there...will be there way to represent your state
Fight fight fight!  Yay Ron Wyden.  Proud you are my senator.
@WomenG4Hillary  America will pay the price
The " "Grand Obstructionist Party" is the definition of hypocrisy.
@SenateDems because the #GOP is corrupt just like their nominees,that way they can all steal together off the American People#DEMS
The WH is breaking laws and and @GOP Senators are not following their own rules.  When does this rise to impeachment?
Is they aren't going to be punished for breaking the rules, then what does it even matter?
You must have seen it on the news, since you didn't even show up. Coward!
what is the penalty that they will incur for rule-breaking?
call it out like it is.
A fascist dictatorship! # The Resistance.
@AJentleson shameful!
@SenSchumer  not really true and you know it. Under Reid, @SenateDems changed the rules to majority vote. @SenateGOP follow suit
