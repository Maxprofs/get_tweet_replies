complete BS GOP destroying USA We all deserve same coverage as Congress or U all need to lose Ur HC to save budget money GOT IT??!
Agreed!  If costs are so high they have to cut everything, then cut their care,  too... they get what we do.  
THAT IS FAIR - we pay their salaries rven if we do not vote them there And I sure as hell dont vote for bigots
Exactly!!  Time to go!
Trump's GOP promises Trumpcare Armageddon killing 24m from healthcare.Obamacare gave 20m.Insane GOP loves to sign death sentence.
Yes the Democrats spent a lot of time creating the #ACA which has failed. 7 years of pain for tax payers  will be over soon
Republicans are so fractured, made worse by the looming FBI investigation into Trump! Move over -the Dems are coming!
Seems like the GOP wants to push through AHCA just so Trump can go on TV and take credit. Government isn't a reality show!
probably won't debate b/c they have an indefensible position and would be "exposed" for their greed and selfishness.
@SenSchumer Senators - you must take the position that Trump is illegitimate. Period. Do YOUR jobs!  We're watching out here...
@SenSchumer Waa! Shows how Democrats are selling American lives to global slavery.
You passed ObamaCare in the dead of night while Americans celebrated Christmas with their families. Lol
@SenSchumer NOW THERE IS STUPIDITY RON. 60 DAYS INTO ADM. AND YOU COMPARE IT TO 365 DAYS. YOU GET A CUPCAKE AND KOOLAID FOR THAT.
Ken, read the infographic.
I did, it's very clear you didn't. 365 days in a year, 60 days into a presidency.
For the sake of argument your candidate is pushing these timelines. promised to defeat ISIS in 30 days
can u tell me where to find that 30 day quote please?
thank you for opposing the affordable care act repeal bill!
Surprised it was hashed out in a series of "tweets"
Speaks volumes you won't address this very real, very dangerous problem:
#Trump #Hannity #tcot
My rates jumped $1K/mo with 6K DED  Oldest son qualifies for medicaid and BCBS says too late to remove off policy.
Repeal #Obamacare! It's UNSUSTAINABLE!!! A VERY Bad law. Let market place bring options to patients. Patient-centered care works.
@SenSchumer We cannot allow this travesty!
The travesty is what we have now. Wake up !
They had 6 years to fix it. Has nothing to do with people just their agenda!
Everything they passed Obama VETO'D
Next Wyden will tell us we can keep our Dr. and he will save each family $2,500. Then he will conveniently exempt himself.
@SenSchumer Wow, this is rich! Does no one remember, "We have to pass it to find out what's in it"? #Obamacare #politics #crap
Would be more pertinent if they needed the democrats help....
You are a freaking SuperHero 
Keep at em! You are an #OathKeeper 

@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP consistently are #OathBreakers
have u forgotten ur leader's remarks; "we have to pass it to find out what's in it"?
We Don't Care. We sat through 8 years of Obama corruption, grow up or go home!!
@SenSchumer when u won't negotiate, just want  2 obstruc. I'd do nothing n let u all rot in the wind with obamacare. U screwed us
b-b-b-but nobody read the  original ACA bill...
that's because you couldn't get enough Democrats into the crap that you sold America, KEEP YOUR DOCTOR remember that
@PxlJedi  Read the chart. You are yelling for no apparent reason. Hillary has nothing to do with this. It's like you have turrets.
@SenSchumer if they keep it up there won't be a GOP by 2020, bullies and cheaters are never around for long,no one is all-powerful
Impressive.
@TopherSpiro "Fools rush in..." Or in Trump Americanese "Fools russian..." Thxs for chart. We are watching, calling, activating.
@SenSchumer Shame on the GOP
That's because ... Trump’s Budget and Healthcare Plan are Economic Terrorism
@SenSchumer where was the debate on Obamacare ? Passed before it was written. #Fail
@SenSchumer you mean like the one the Dems had on Obamacare?  Your hypocrisy is showing..
there is plenty of debate going on re: ahca....unlike dems, gop actually have independent thinkers.....dems are iron fist partisan
@SenSchumer But Obamacare still had to be passed for us to find out what's in it. Democrats have zero credibility
You have to pass it to see what's in it ! Sound familiar? Not STHU
And how many days are you working in April ?
Not a fan of what they're doing but the Dems spent 80 days total on Obamacare and still no one read it.  Wonder why it failed?
@SenSchumer We felt the same way when Democrats were on their 8 yr. Power trip.
Demand real change; another baby step will not keep our empire from disarray. Wait, too late. Repeal the Controlled Substances Act
go back and look how Obama care was passed
all that while you locked out the Republicans. Remember what u say, election has consequence...hmmm
"We should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court, except in extraordinary circumstances,” ur words in 2007
@SenSchumer debate what? You don't need more than 20hrs to work out Obama care has failed miserably.
Repeal it...and replace it...
hell, they don't even read the bills their lobbyists hand to them.
@SenSchumer 
To much BS on the hill
A real debate wld show moral bankruptcy of their plan 2 further cripple&limit healthcare for all but the privileged #TrumpRyanCare
@SenSchumer Dems did nothing but lie to people in 2009! @TonyPhyrillas @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @6abc @nytimes @latimes @NBCNews
@SenSchumer But DEMS publicaly stated that they would not work on it with GOP. Would all vote "no"
@SenSchumer Guess it is up to you guys to put the brakes on hard. This is a bad plan.
@SenSchumer they know they have to sneak this in on the public or there would be riots in the streets
#Trumpcare The GOP isn't serving the public; they're serving their own twisted revenge fantasies.
We must demand one.
Obamacare is strangling my family's finances! We need HELP!
@SenSchumer Hypocrites..EXACTLY what you dems did last time..elections have consequences..you're now a bunch of childish crybabies
This is rediculous.  No vote till POTUS is cleared of treason!
and you still managed to cram through a piece of garbage that is hugely unpopular.
shows how much they care about all us out here
Thank you, thank you, thank you for pushing hard on this
Seems like they are intimidated by Trump. Think they should be more worried about getting reelected in 2018.
@SenSchumer thats correct. Better than if you want to know whats in the bill you have to pass it sight unseen. Losers
#Obamacare
yikes.
what a deceitful move.
@MrDane1982 @HouseGOP are screwing American People so rushing it & @POTUS cares about rich, Corp & Ins Co #PeopleOverParty
am sure this is confusing-GOP was asked to get your lazy asses OUT of the health insurance industry. That's a 1 liner.
Don't let it pass. Not one DEM better be on the Y list.
at least we don't have to pass it so we can find out what's inside it... also, it won't pass. p.s. you had supermajorities in 2009
you could have passed public option or medicare for all.  and didn't. instead you passed a Republican plan.  working out for you?
Yup.
@MrDane1982 @GOP  They need to push the bill "quickly" because they know it's a POS & wont stand up to scrutiny #Trumpcare

@SenSchumer 
Is the cabinet and place yet?
The @SenateGOP stopped listening to their constituents. When gov. stops listening 2 public bad things happen. History won't B kind
"Whoever knew Healthcare is so complicated? ... But it's simple really. And it's called Good Healthcare." -45
.@RonWyden I made it speak a bit louder....
you do realize Obamacare wasn't even written before it was passed, so your graphic is a #fail
@SenSchumer when the Senate and House are subject to the same Health and Insurance Laws, I'll listen. Til then, Dems own it always
No matter where it goes from here. You Democrats started the clusterfuck. Thanks for nothing.
@SenSchumer , Do Not Let them RUSH. GET IT
RIGHT!! Talk with Ins. Co.'s, MD's and Health institutions. People
need care!!!
Debate? You mean like Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi allowed on your socialized medicine bill that was only a title?
There was 80 days of debate. It's not our fault the gop decided they would rather fuck little boys in rest stops than show up. That's on you
@SenSchumer Did we debate Obamacare?
Apparently I t takes much less time to and effort to pass a massive tax cut. #Trumpcare is wrong!  @RonWyden @SenSchumer #Gaslight
Those that voted for Trump and lose their healthcare - You get what you deserved - All others, I am sorry.
hey snowflake, I voted for trump and cant afford $16K yr for HC.don't feel sorry for me.  I am fine.
They should debate as much as Obama and the DNC did.
@SenSchumer LIKE the debate @TheDemocrats HAD on the ACA?
@SenSchumer it's dead
@SenSchumer Bahahaha now you want to debate  get off your & work with them instead of fighting them!
They're all Quislings.  Traitorous.  Putin's Putos.  They are Enemies to the State and need to be treated as such.
HERE'S AN ENEMY OF THE STATE! #CrookedHillary

I see.  You have zero defense, so you response is to scream "HILLARY!".  Pretty transparent.  SAD.
enemies of state?That's sad. Obama care was forced down our throats. How bout we take time and get it right?
If Reps would work with Dems to fix everything, robs wld be perfect but they refuse to budge!
Speaks volumes that Congress won't discuss refusal to embrace AHCA for themselves/staff in bill HR307 as well.
I love this bill!
this chart is BS  the DEM did not have real debate in 2009.  Even Peolosi did not have a chance to read it all!
Speaks volumes that you need to compare all of 2009 to the first 60 days of a new presidency
@SenSchumer the process JUST STARTED,
separate healthcare and state
GOP. 2018 make a change!!!
"0"day. What's the rush, is there something you're trying to hide from the American people
no you can actually read it before you pass it...unlike Obamacare
seriously....go read it
totally untrue!  That was Pelosi who said that.  The bill is on his website
@SenSchumer this speaks volumes that the American people don't matter to you payback and pay 4play is all you care about
Consideration for my vote for their reelection- 2 seconds.
and the background noise of Republican hypocrisy is annoying too
that's the whining of the liberal left losers
Truth be told. My family loses its Healthcare.
Self employed, and I work my ass off.
I can't wait to have actual politicians running our country again.
volumes...
But Senator, it's a smaller bill!
