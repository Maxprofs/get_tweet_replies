Fu*king hypocrites. Yes, we deserve transparency. We deserve to know what HRC said to Wall St.
Do you often require more from women than men? Mommy issues?
Not at all. Do you have thinky issues?
U do dummy.
So all you have is insults. Typical.
Transparency like the TPP you've been pushing? The one we can't see? You're such a hypocrite.
You support TPP, we don't give a darn about your futile gestures
You realize they're all pushing TPP right? Do you have any morals? Integrity?
Then we need a breakdown of where our tax dollars are spent & laws average people understand. @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
Will you be calling on @HillaryClinton to release the transcripts of her talks to Banksters? @RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
they should also release their sealed college records.  #obamaInternationalstudent
Who'd HRC fuk-over 2earn $150+ million off Wall St.= 4subprime boom 4 bundles? @SeeYouInPhilly
Most Americans don't care about Trump's taxes. We know he's rich. Where are the transcripts?
for what it's worth I'm also a proponent of 24/7 audio & video on every congressperson RT @RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
my point is that the government has access to your bathroom emails and calls to other people in other bathrooms ;)
I agree to disagree. this fight is ongoing. follow @EFF for more
Yes Americans deserve transparency #ReleaseTheTranscripts & the emails. @RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
.@RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine Americans deserve an IRS that does the audits, not witch hunting Dems.
But this will NEVER include TRANSCRIPTS, right??? That would be my RUIN!!! #Hillary2016
How lovely, three losers who have been living off tax payers their entire life. Pocahontas haha
also #ReleaseTheTranscripts way more important
@RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
.@RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine how MUCH transparency? What about emails about the TPP? Those can wait till after the election?
i love you! @RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine Release the TPP emails! Comply with FOIA!
Well, where are your tax returns Trump! He probably paid zero Fed. taxes. Sickening.
Where r 30,000 deleted emails? Where r Crooked Clinton Foundation's tax returns?
Thank you for doing this. I was hoping it would happen. ALL Candidates must #ReleaseTheReturns
And their #WallStreet speech transcripts.
I think the IRS lets you know if your tax filing is a problem. Should not be senate's job! HAHA
Hilary is transparent???
What about speeches to Goldman Sachs? What about accepting bribes/donations from Arab countries? Do they count?
thank you all for your leadership!
I just gagged. @RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
If @realDonaldTrump releases tax returns will @SenWarren release personnel records @ Penn& #HarvardLaw;minority box?
start with Obama administration
@RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
Transparency, eh. Is that why you support Hillary Clinton? Or does your broker want on ISAB?
We already know Trump doesn't pay taxes,&no one cares any more than about Hillary's corruption!
Lets start with transparency on @HumaAbedin with #muslinbrotherhood
Here's transparency for you: Russian Government Intercepted and Will Release Hillary’s Emails
I think we should ask for signed contracts from our representatives.
As long it is a detailed accounting of the Clinton foundation. I don't have a problem with that.

tell Obama that. He's the least transparent POTUS we've had. Wise up. @HillaryClinton
DWS and the other Establishment Dems are not fighting you.. like on payday lender regulations?
#ReleaseTheSpeeches #NeverHillary #StillSanders
@RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine

Demanding that SenWarren RELEASE documents proving she's INDIAN! or return money/scholarships
Transparency? Then call for @HillaryClinton to #ReleaseTheTranscripts & @FBI to share her emails
Or nominees can just create a SLUSH FUND like the #ClintonFoundation and avoid accountability.

This lier needs to payback the real Indians here for the tuition paid out for her education.
YES Americans do deserve transparency and that's why Hillary should #ReleaseTheTranscripts
Who gives a shit, tax returns are the least important thing that needs more transparency.
If Trump had to chose between running for President and releasing his taxes, maybe he drops out?
The two least transparent people of all time Crooked Hillary and Marxist Obama
America deserve to beat the shit out of you deadbeat politicians
Hell transparency from DEM's that is a joke look at the last 7 years of the POTUS
You people are fucking hypocrites. I hope this bites you in the ass in the next election.
they also deserve someone who is not being criminally investigated by the FBI.. HELLO
Well why not require senators and congressmen to release theirs too then?
Obumma didn't release anything. All hidden... Lets make rules for ALL
LMAO! That's a good one. Transparency. LOL! Didn't demand the same of Hillary, what a hypocrite
Coming from an administration where Obama won't show his college record, was complicit w Hillary emails.

yea we do deserve transparency so @HillaryClinton #ReleaseTheTranscripts enough screwing around!
Yes, Americans deserve transparency, so demand that @HillaryClinton #ReleaseTheTranscripts, also
Slippery slope. Sounds unconstitutional.  What's next, birth certificates? Credit reports?
@RonWyden @SenWarren @SenBennetCO @timkaine
How about an amendment that blocks ppl under FBI criminal investigations running for @POTUS #NeverHillary
So you're going to ask @POTUS to release the TPP emails before Nov 31st? Transparency my ass #ByeBlue

+1 Trump is hiding shady business deals. Using the audit to hide it from the American People.
And those transcripts?
.@RonWyden No. The bill should include ALL Washington politicians who hold office.#transparency #taxReturns Americans deserve transparency.
Lets see where the Clinton ¨charity¨ money is going to... Are they paying taxes? #PanamaPapers
dangerous territory to discuss if we want to move away from the transcript talk...
America deserves a leader that will tell the truth .
I want to see what Hillary promised Goldman Saks. IF there ever were "speeches" given
Yes Americans deserve transparency but for near 8 years we've not had it thanks to @BarackObama
How about some transparency on Clinton's emails?
