LIVE: Pres. Trump announces GOP's new tax reform plan. https://www.pscp.tv/w/bJqilDgyODR8MVprS3pPYkxlTGRHdl5KscLZBuo2MSJz46D_xeEPPU-dZaCAL9r3iTjmh_85 …
Fact-check: it is the biggest tax cut for the *wealthy* #TrumpTaxScam
Health care fact-check: There are NOT the votes for #GrahamCassidy
The #TrumpTaxScam raises taxes on many middle-class families
The people who benefit from the #trumptaxscam ARE the donors, ARE the special interests, NOT hard-working, tax-paying citizens.
Warning: I may go over 140 characters in my fact-checking. But I will try my hardest not to.
A middle-class family with 4 children will LOSE at least $4900 of tax benefits under #TrumpTaxScam
Repealing the AMT *will* personally benefit you @realDonaldTrump based on your 2005 tax return. #TrumpTaxScam
This is not true. Only estates worth more than $11 million have to pay the estate tax. #TrumpTaxScam
Eliminating the estate tax = another great example of how Trump's family would save billions under #TrumpTaxScam
More people will have a net tax increase. See pages 4 & 5 of your #TrumpTaxScam plan. https://www.axios.com/the-gop-anti-establishments-early-2018-playbook-2490172326.html …
The #TrumpTaxScam rewards companies that sends red, white, and blue jobs overseas.
#TrumpTaxScam creates huge new passthrough loophole. Christmas morning for tax cheats & a huge benefit to Trump & his 500+ passthroughs.
There is no repatriation rate in this plan. This is pure Trump speculation. #trumptaxplan
Quite the opposite @realdonaldtrump - #TrumpTaxScam rewards companies leaving the U.S.
Congress did one-time tax holiday in 2004. What happened? NO jobs. COST taxpayer $$. REWARDED CEOs. Sad!
#TrumpTaxScam to multinationals: Take the money and run (overseas)
The only miracle here would be if the middle class truly benefits from this #trumptaxscam
Hey @realDonaldTrump - what happened to closing the carried interest loophole? Remember this from your campaign?
Bottom line: Nothing in this #TrumpTaxScam for the middle class. Big, fat giveaways to Trump & his friends.
Shut up!
Love you Senator Wyden! #Patriot
Agreed. Shouldn't take too long. 
Who cares if everyone gets a tax cut?  As long as we get one. Americans can read and will know you're lying when tax reform is passed & they see their taxes go down. @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @GOP
ONLY ones getting a tax cut are the wealthy...like trump. U say u “don’t care” that speaks volumes of how u feel about ur children’s future.
GOP is out for themselves only
Just run the comments by Mnunchin's wife about wealth and that should destroy any sympathy ppl have for the 1%.
Good let the facts about Democrat thieves begin
FACT CHECK. BECAUSE TRUMP ONLY KNOW HIS OWN FAKE SELF
IF HE WASN'T ALWAYS IN CAMPAGIN MODE HE WON'T KNOW HOW TO FILL HIS DAY  LET ALONE LEAD
@NBCNightlyNews #TrumpTaxScam is trickle down economics for the 100th time. They never stop with their corp give aways.
2% have gotten two huge tax cuts under Reagan and GW. Timeto raise taxes on rich. 1% need to pay their fair share.
I would settle for @NBCNightlyNews simply asking how much #Republicans plan to gut SSI, #Medicare #Medicaid to pay for their "#TaxReform"
Wyden is another hate and biased political person with nothing of value to say
#FickleClownEconomics #TrumpTaxScam #TaxReform
Do NOTHING Congressman from ORE GONE
I'm sure it's just as caring & sharing as the healthcare bills were. 
There won't be too many facts.
You’re on the finance committee. Can’t you kill this?!
Begin? Where have you been? The fact-checking's just getting warmed up. ;)
Fact 10 Trillion more debt under Dem leadership. Fact foodstamp recipients up 49 million. Fact jobless rate lowest in 16 years under Trump
Kick this new BS down the road.  Let’s smarten up, people!
This will not turn out good at all
@CHHolte Yes Please
No need. The lies are prima facie!
Exactly, sir.
Admit it, your mostly worried your slush fund won't be around anymore.  Perhaps it will force you hacks to manage money better.
#ReleaseTheReturns #Fatberg #dontheCon @realDonaldTrump
Don't bother...

NYC is outa here...#Manhattanistan
A story from @RonWyden GrahamCassidy https://tttthreads.com/t/913124176407523328 … 
reply 'block me' to stop :)
Thank you! #NeverMyPresident
Less bitching from Democrats and more solutions. You've already demonstrated how good you are at bitching. GOVERN OR STFU.
You guys need to scream about this on every news channel and to every paper.  Tired of the messages of the Dems getting drowned out by chaos
WE the PEOPLE need to scream at our MoC every single day to not vote for this plan!
Agreed!!
So, will GOP be exposed again for threatening harm to American families & the American economy?  @NancyPelosi  @SenSchumer

Since there won't be any facts to check, can we call it "lie confirmation"?
go get 'em OR Senator @RonWyden!
I can think of three names behind this
I am sure there are more. Deason,  Koch and Koch.
Mercer too
Good man, @RonWyden 

Accurate hash tag.
OMG!!! I mean really OMG!!!
We want a HOLD put on the gop's tax reform until they address waiving the Jones Act for aid to Puerto Rico including 1 of continuing rebuild
trickle down again. Never worked what makes them think will work now? Bush lowered corporate and increased military. Up goes national debt.
ask the people of kansas how the republican tax experiment went for them.  they will tell you how bad it was.
What isn't a scam w/ Trump. "Travel" ban=Muslim ban. Trumpcare=taxcut for rich. TrumpTax= taxcut for rich. Trumpwhatever= taxcut for rich
We get @TheDemocrat hate @POTUS & his tweets but you aren't much better and haven't been in over a decade. #FakeCongress
How can you keep up. There is a lie told every semi-second.
Fact checking or fake news. They didn't want CBO for HC. They don't want facts for tax reform. 
I'm surprised it doesn't include retroactive IRS "pardon" for tax cheats like Drumpf.
I can tell you he blatantly lied about the estate tax and farms.
Why don’t you fact check Lois Lerner, and the current tax regime (known quantities) while you’re at it?
#SENATOR?!
REALLY ?
HOW IN THE WORLD DID
#YOU #GET #ELECTED ?
#SERIOUSLY ?!

#OREGON ?

WHAT HAS #YOUR
#SENATOR DONE FOR
#YOU~
#LATELY ?
Oregon voters seem to vote for ppl they recognize, not on policy.  @RonWyden doesn't even live in Oregon lives in NY.
Awe. U don't like him telling the truth... Boohoo!
Sickening to see how many "entitled" spoiled brats are in our government! What health care do you have Ron? How much are your premiums?
He is standing up for his constituents! And the rest of Americans! I'm sure he understands your feelings for Single Payer
He's not speaking for me and what I voted for or the "rest" of Americans either. Where's all the $ for single payer coming from?
Lol aren't you just a sweetheart. Call me what you want, makes no difference to me.
Trump will directly benefit from this tax plan! He is a conman people. Reality check #TrumpTaxScam
How do you figure this ? AMERICANS making little$ a year will pay 0 federal tax, families will be helped tremendously by that
Bahaha! Do u know anything about taxes and how they work?
I know that families making$24000 a year will pay no federal tax , that is huge for low income families to have more $ every week

The biggest problem America has is Washington just can't allow @POTUS to be successful
Another who thinks simplicity will save $, do u know how 2
 do ur own? If not I'm guessing u have no idea how it works. Ur statement, false
You crazy liberal lol
When we hit another recession, yes we will. This is repeat of the start of the last one!
Dollhands designed his  #TrumpSCAM tax giveaways to wealth hoarders plan with only himself in mind.
We can’t support or approve ANY tax plan until @realDonaldTrump released his taxes and we see how much personal benefit he gets. @CNN
#WaiveTheJonesAct
There is no real plan! It's only what they want without explanation. They can't tell u how because it will show it only helps the top.
He’s already lied 6x by my count
6 months to repair electrical? Tax giveaway  prevents us from doing this:
No kidding. I just wrote my MoC about because loss state and local tax and medical expense deductions would kill middle-class/seniors! #sham
How does the GOP, the President plan on paying for the three hurricanes, the wildfires and more without TAXES?
Buy charging you.  
@NBCNightlyNews How about the Ron Wyden Senator work scam. ACA needs fixing get to work or refund your salary.
Awe another one who doesn't  like truth! Boohoo...
Awe another one who believes the Democratic BS. ACA is failing and Wyden does nothing.
Only in GOP states so look to ur party for that problem. Facts help!
Here is a fact I am not a member of any political party. Why is Merkley and Sanders sponsoring medicare for all?
Ask them, Sanders is an independent.... I think it would be nice, but know it will never happen. Nobody says the ACA couldnt be fixed, GOP
States opt out of the expansion which hurt their states by removing funding. The bill was a GOP thought, but once a dem pushed it they had
To destroy it, they wanted to pass it..so now they cant get something that will help, it hurts more then helps which also skyrockets prices
Why bother?
It's never changed a thing gong in my wow years.
wut?
Puerto Rico is in part a victim to tax cuts for wealthy, just like the lousy schools, roads, bridges, dams & emergency preparedness in USA
PR is also victim to Trump Failure.  He claimed bankruptcy in 2015 on golf course leaving PR with a $33mil debt
"fact checking" pre assumes he has facts to start with. Just call it "lie detecting"
