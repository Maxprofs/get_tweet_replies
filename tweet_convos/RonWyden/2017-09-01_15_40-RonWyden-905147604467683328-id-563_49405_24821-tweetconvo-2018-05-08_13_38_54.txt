This is not ACA imploding. This is sabotage
Well explain to us then WHO IS PAYING for this wonderful Obamacare? There are hardly any ins companies left to buy from. LEFT NUTISTS
You really don't understand how health insurance works....
Insurance I get...OVOMITCARE is a tax and is set up so that those who WORK and are healthy PAY so those who DONT WORK &cheat system continue
Insurance, guess who pays? The taxpayer. Instead of being a hateful person, educate yourself.
How is hateful to point out TRUTH? To you its hateful cause MILLIONS OF TAXPAYERS REFUSE TO AGREE WITH U LIBERALS

Hey, where'd you find that? I'm totally on board!
Ok I looked for a current image but could not find. Is it ok if I use yours? Not an MD but am a BSNRN.
yes of course!
What's funny @TopherSpiro is that ACA was an epic failure long b4 he pulled ads. So, 4 any1 2 act as tho @realDonaldTrump caused it is
That's really not true, though.....
It was failing b4 @realDonaldTrump became POTUS!
Not true (at least not entirely). If the ACA was truly an "abject failure" it would've been easy to repeal and/or replace it.
Not true. Dems weren't going to do it no matter what. RINOs don't like Trump but they'll pay for that. Trump will let it implode on its own.
Trump is being calllous. It's not failing entirely, but he'll gladly push it off the cliff.
What's funny, u guys don't even realize that the callousness of Obama, the creator of ACA & the Dems designed for the ACA to fail. #WakeUp
The architect of the ACA was the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. With all due respect, you need to wake up.
Even so, the damage the #GOP s done already has inflated rates beyond affordability and after the theft last night on the #GOPTaxScam its over.
You say that as if it was actually affordable before trump took office....it wasnt
It will be less affordable if fewer people sign up. That is a FACT. It’s how the insurance model works, and why universal single payer is cheapest for everyone.
Cheaper isn't usually better
What would be great Topher is to have major celebrities get involved. Want to reach the young, they can make healthcare cool! 1/
They started to do that last year, Kerry Washington for example, young musicians who did their own viral videos... 2/
Major concerts, the equivalent of "Farm Aide" only, it's "Sign-Up Aide" 3/ Cc @ASlavitt @TripleTChicago
Obama alumni must have some major contacts with folks who could throw a series of mega-cool sign-up splashes.
Don't wait til 12/15. Sign up now!
FYI!!!! America is trillions of dollars in debt. Health care is not a right! You act as though people are dying in the streets, which is not the case. People are given Medicaid. They are not denied medical care. The ER’s can NOT deny treatment.
Understand this: we hated #Obamacare. @realDonaldTrump listened. And thankfully is dismantling it!
ACA sucks.
Ok and? How is that a bad thing?
Another onepic.twitter.com/4G583Hkwaa
I have key information based on first hand experience. Ins comps have too much power. There were NO PLANS ON ACA 2cover my needs. I am FRIGHTENED of who is in charge of MY LIFE, because it's NOT ME or MY DOCTOR.
So you want the government in charge? The same government that waste trillions, starts wars and never finishes them and can't do anything else right?
Topher the Open Enrollment period in previous years was only supposed to go to Dec 15th but due to so many glitches in the system it had to be extended.
What gives him the right to do this??? I thought Congress was in charge of $$$$? Is this legal?
I can't get the ACA page link to open up twitter retweet/reply icons/commands....is there a trick to it?
Another one--people are inspired!!pic.twitter.com/8IpL3jBuOB
Thought I'd let you know in CA, we just got our Kaiser/ACA 2018 re-enrollment info. Our monthly premium=doubled, deductible up. Thx 2 Trump!
I know people who's doubled 2 yrs ago before Trump. This is ONE of the reasons liberals vote Trump
What people don't understand is how enormous a job it was to implement healthcare. Of course it needed some fixing here and there. Social Security wasn't perfect the very first year. Things would have gradually gotten better as it stabilized. He destroyed it because of his ego!
You can't blame none of this on Trump. ACA was owned by the insurance companies...
https://www.fiverr.com/mousumi456/do-flyer-design-within-6-hours …
Republicans are plunging a knife into the Affordable Care Act's gut, with repeal of the individual mandate as their most lethal act of sabotage yet. As they let the ACA bleed out, they'll blame the ACA itself for the bloody mess. The Life of the Black President's Policy Matters.
The aca is and always was pathetic the sooner you understand that the better

I disagree ..Enrollment period is the same this year as it has been in the past. No slashing that I can see. I think you are doing people a disservice with your negative & unsupported assessment of the projected tax bill. Obviously you don't look for or point out the positives.
What do you pay for your Obamacare.

Signed up today!!!!
The ACA raised taxes to fund an open ended expansion of Medicaid spending and subsidies. Did we really need more entitlement spending?

Again..get a grip. Do you have any idea how many reminders have popped up not only in my email inbox from the ACA and my past insurer, who has since dropped and my likely new insurer, but also in my actual mailbox. I'm going to guess at least two dozen total.
U dont need adbertising $ from gov Cant get away from all the insurance brokers contacting you Most ad contracts end up w IG audits & findings
Just a short time to enroll for such an important program to protect your healthcare.
Worst insurance ever. $700 a month for basic bullshit insurance. That covers barely anything.
I hate hearing that. ALL should have equal health care to the richest at affordable cost. They can raise my taxes to make it happen.

Uh, tell that to the GOP-controlled House & Senate. Even THEY think it's rotten ...
@realDonaldTrump @nhdogmom @joncoopertweets Enrollment way up because ACA is better than going without insurance.
Wow… A whole month and a half. Even with all of his little tricks enrollment is up from last year!! Again… How can this be legal? He's not working for us unless it's something HE WANTS!!

Didn't work; record sign-ups. Trump is now officially the Failure in Chief.
I have been sharing the information on Open Enrollment. Have you noticed hundreds of thousands of people are enrolling? Quid pro quo.
I enrolled in spite of this!
Lies it's been public knowledge folks. That's the truth
Don't sign on to ACA, let O'Care crash and burn, we are waiting for it. #RxRankings
@Teamsters @AFLCIO @CSEA_Now @IBEW @CWA GOP's continued attacks on ACA motivating great dignup numbers by people afraid repeal will happen.
Trump and GOP are making a point to allow ACA to crash. GOP and Trump have a agreement with insurance companies to make sure they raise premiums so it looks like the ACA is imploding. Again nothing but lies from Trump and the GOP to the American people.
It was open yesterday, Sunday even though it was suppose to close for maintenance!
This is illegal! Trump took an oath to uphold the Constitution & Article 2 demands that he “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”
Premiums in Virginia quadrupling knocking any employee or small business onto the street
To anyone but a Mental Midget Marxist-Obamacare has failed.It was an unsustainable impossibility.#Let's Attack Trump for Not advertising It!
IMPORTANT! The website to enroll will be off-line for "maintenance" DURING THE ALREADY SHORTENED ENROLLMENT PERIOD as listed below. pic.twitter.com/JVScInCZSF

Who needs advertising for health care? Are they the same people who need it for toilet paper? People are not as stupid as the left thinks
What? You need a comerical to know where to get health care? Do you also know that a curling iron is for external use only?

Agreed he gutted the ACA. But YOU Mr. Spiro are dishonest in not admitting the problems that already existed that were causing it to fail.
Please retweet!
He went further this Morning. Will no longer pay subsidies. So this program will not be much help anymore either

Don't forget the systems will be offline for a good chunk of each weekend for "routine maintenance." Right in the middle of the weekend.

And is taking the site down for 12 hours for several days for 'routine maintenance', during open enrollment.
Everyone knows the site had problems upon rollout, which was reported back when it launched years ago. This new maintenance is ill timed.
Now enrollment website will be closed on Sundays. Does that make any sense? No. Just more cruelty from evil ignoramuses.
Wow so many retweets! This must be quite important!
ACA is still the law. America benefits from a healthy population. Cowardly McConnell, Heller can't stand that a black man has more empathy

#ACA #Insurance #Medical #HealthCare
.PLEASE RETWEET... if @POTUS won't help people obtain ACA we will!
#ACA was designed to fail to usher in Single Payer...lets just be honest here dont be a #Gruber
Yes, because of course the people signing up for Obamacare are on twitter.
My "health insurance" went to $1,200/mo in 2017 for 2 ppl. We're not rich, struggling middleclass No $$$ left to pay copays & deductibles
And unfortunately again this year, 5 people in my inner circle, will once again not have ANY insurance and be paying the penalty.
Why don't they buy insurance then?
It's no longer affordable. Can't buy what you can't pay for. Know 1 gal,who signs up then cancels. Gov thinks she's covered, so NO penality.
Wow ACA allows 6 weeks for signing up for insurance? Wish we got that! My husbands company allows maybe 4 weeks to choose our plan.
He has a plan, big difference.
Nor be healthy either, apparently.
Wow. Way to make health insurance more expensive. That's what we get when we allow Obama's Big Gov to interfere with the free market.
Earth to Topher-KEY INFO U r Ignoring: ACA Premiums are going up 20% Next year but not our Wages! We were screwed by Wyden!

how much funding for ACA advertising
By all means, throw your money down the drain, Again !
It's not AFORDABLE!
You're right. It's the SELF-DESTRUCTING healthcare program where PREMIUMS keep RISING. But it does help those who can get Federal subsidies.
Right, all u need is $15,000 for the deductible and a dr. that accepts it and golly gee, u have coverage for that broken leg.
I posted on Facebook and someone from Greece removed it!
Reposting!
Did trump change the name Obamacare to Trumpcare? Received email for enrolling today under new name.
Technically the law is the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The name "ObamaCare" was a nickname given by the GOP as a "negative name" association.
If you've gotten enrollment emails mentioning either ObamaCare OR TrumpCare...that seems quite suspicious. Can you screenshot them at all?
