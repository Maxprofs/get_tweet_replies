Obamacare saves lives – let this cancer survivor tell you how 
Sorry Ron government run health care sucks and is incredibly expensive.
your hypocrisy and inherent dishonesty is why the left lost and will continue to lose
anything is going to  be better than Obamacare. You must pass before you can see it...HA HA
so you didn't mind the Pelosi urging ti pass the bill to find our what's in it for Dems only Obamacare bill..hypocit.
Pelosi, “We’ll have to pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it.”
Years ago the democrats crafted a healthcare bill behind closed doors without republican input and only allowed 24 hr to review before vote?
The Democrats should make the GOP own this POS in public.
Tell that to Mitch McConnell  His FAX Number is 202-224-2499  FAX him this message  Debate the Bill   the AHCA (Trumpcare)
Wait, I question the 'to defend Trumpcare. NO! We say #NoAHCA!  #TheResistance
You are such a hypocrite you #Dems passed #Obamacare without showing anyone the bill. How can you complain.
Please don't pull punches on #Trumpcare b/c of shooting. Use EVERY parliamentary delay available!! Too important!!!!
Just curious @RonWyden ..why was it okay to wait to see Obamacare & why does no Dem ever speak of this, only Republicans? Is it not true?
I would be stoked 2 have a Town Hall at all. Just 1. FORBIDDEN in Indiana.
Democrats must be at the table. Let's remember Hillary won the popular vote by 3 million legal votes. We all count! #ShowUsTheBill
You had me at retweet. Keep up the good work Senator.
If their going to institute #DeathPanels make them do it in the light if day
Standing Up for Our seniors
.@RonWyden withhold consent and filibuster with amendments to slow down this process and demand transparency. Time to fight fire with fire.
Dont have to pass it to see whats it it? Thats what your #Democrat counterpart #NancyPelosi said for #Obamacare #Hypocrisy
I’m not a Democrat and I think the ACA was a sellout to the insurance and pharm industries.
I concur with your statment. Hello fellow pdx'er! *waves*
#ShowUsTheBill
We want Dems to stop cooperating on Republican Senate Biz. Use unanimous consent and other measures to stop trump agenda.@Chuckschumer
Filibuster the bill through thousands of amendments.
We'll show u the bill when u show evidence in Russia fraud
I'm glad to be an Oregonian when he's representing us in the Senate! Stay strong @RonWyden & keep the pressure on with your tough questions
I'm with you Ron
Oregon senators--Filibuster by amendment! Unlimited amendments. Play hardball. @SenJeffMerkley #ShowUsTheBill
Filibuster by amendment! You can prevent this disaster, if you give the American people more time to see it coming.  Please fight!
Did you change your license to X yet?
Thank you Senator! I support halting senate business until they #ShowUsTheBill #nowealthcare
Come out of the closet @SenateGOP show us the bill #AHCA
I already sent you a fax about this. If they want reconciliation simply BURY them in amendments. Hang it up long enough we all can read.
Public
@Regency_Reader inappropriate and disgusting
Wanting to read the bill is inappropriate?
Keep pushing Ron. You're terrific!

The @GOP is far too cowardly. Mama always said "You don't air your dirty laundry in public".
Don't let them win SAVE our health care...stay strong
I want them to #passthebill and I wish you had been helpful.
#stopbitchingandgettowork. @NancyPelosi @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats You guys did this same shit. #transparancy
Retweeted
2/2 it only states it will fight hate, bigotry, & violance. #ShowUsThisBill or does it list rights you wish to restrict like the 1A.
In the words of the famously wise (cough) Nancy Pelosi you have to pass it to read it
Instead of disavowing violent groups like ANTIFA, BLM, & BAMN your sponsoring a bill that doesn't show any details 1/2
You got it. Retweeted
They never will. None of these slimeballs want anything 2do w/ANY healthcare bill. Their "Repeal&Replace" bluff was called when Drumpf won
They know how overwhelmingly unpopular this bill is. Hiding it till last moment.
If you haven't SEEN the bill HOW can you & your fellow Democrats telling EVERYONE about millions cut, only the RICH are gaining, etc.?
Thank you again Mr . Wyden .
@maddow @Lawrence @jaketapper DEMAND accountability!1
#ShowUsTheBill
Hurts when the shoe is on the other foot.
Senator don't you remember what Speaker Pelosi said about the ACA? That we have to pass the ACA to find out what is in it.
You are one of the best
please DO Not stop fighting this Injustice. no party before people!
Stay Stong Senator!
Please Ron, if they are too ashamed to engage in a public discussion, they shouldn't be in office!
Thanks for speaking out for Oregonians! Have you seen this?
Got a Democratic Senator? Here’s how they can ACTUALLY PLAY HARDBALL on TrumpCare. Yes, they have tools to use. Yes, they can win. 1/
RT @RonWyden Retweet if you want the Senate Republicans to defend #Trumpcare in public & #ShowUsTheBill!
Senator, please read this thread and invoke the vote-o-rama.

Darn, if only you had done the same eight years ago...  Hurts, doesn't it?  #karma #sameshitdifferentday #bothpartiesarecorrupt
My brother in law has a degenerative nerve disease called CMT. Had one foot amputated,  will probably lose other.  Will lose coverage w AHCA
Want to see the bill before I want anyone to defend it.
Just like you did with Obamacare... WAIT A MINUTE!
Not true on Obamacare debates. Hours and hours of open sessions, plus like 50+ GOP amendments.
Feinstein said we have to pass it to know what's in it and politicians were transparent that it wasn't read or understood before passage
It underlies a general complaint I have: stop passing omnibus bills. They tend to suck and be too big to work. Fix actual problems
We're agreed there. Honestly, I expected pushback on ACA, but figured the genie was out of the bottle. On road to single payer now.
I'm horrified at the prospect of rationed care and government running businesses. I've worked on VA issues. It's appalling.
The VA is a separate shameful problem. But medicare works overall, would work better if incentives not to drain it existed.
Medicare health outcomes are awful. The most successful part is part d - modeled on the private market.
Show us the bill
It is an excellent thing we still have senators with integrity like you in Washington.
Add 1,000s of amendments during vote-a-Rama!!! Stall this bill until 2018!!

So constituents: if you have a Democratic Senator tell them to withhold consent and commit to filibuster-by-amendment. 22/
So, are you using an amendment/votaerama strategy to stall this?
Fight for us, Senator! Don't let them take our healthcare!!
What do we do if we want them to resign?
Indeed Senator, if the @GOP wishes to SURVIVE, they'll drop their AUTHORITARIAN POWER TRIP ASAP!
The light of day can reveal the truth and I prefer that to the darkness of shadows in  a senate conference room.
We don't want it defended but we want it vetted properly

#amendmentathon
Sadly the Democrats did the exact same thing in 2010. Why not  make the bill available so WE THE PEOPLE can read it ?
Wyden/Lieu 2020! Keep up the great work Senator! Russia Russia Russia (and Good public policy) every day until Trump is gone gone gone!
Have you heard @ezraklein 's idea about filibustering by Dems offering the unlimited amendments to which you're entitled?
Yes. Dems need to shut this thing down by any means necessary.
It's their JOB. @SenateGOP @SenateDems
Filibuster, Senator! Keep adding amendments during vote-o-rama!!
Retweet if you want @RonWyden to call for Trump's impeachment and prosecution.
Most of my followers want Republicans to work w Democrats to fix what we already have the AcA! Trump must stop sabotaging AcA/medicare
Please broadcast their clandestine activities on  National TV! 17% approval !They obviously don't care about elderly poor disabled,anyone !
#KBATNames
HELL YES! I second that!
I would like the Republicans and demacrats to tell me how we are to get out of this issue please go read https://www.gofundme.com/local-disabled-veteran-help … &letmeknow
Thank you for the good fight.
#ShowUsTheBill
How about single payer? Just propose something better.
