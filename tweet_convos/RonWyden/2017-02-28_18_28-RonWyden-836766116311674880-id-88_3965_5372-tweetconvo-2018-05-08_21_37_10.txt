Crime is low. Net illegal immigration is low or zero. Immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than natives. Terrorism kills almost no one.
That's how GOP ROLLS. They will fix what doesn't need fixing every time/make things worse 4 everybody! Take that 2 the bank!
@narrahkp How about they fix all this corruption & incompetence ROLLING by the moment? How BO is missed!
Further proof it'll be impossible for Trump to say or do anything people on the #CulticLeft will compliment. So why even try?
So I guess just ignore the laws! Murders are statistically are pretty rare why bother prosecuting!
@BillHummel5 And imaginary solutions to big problems.
words deeds... I am not swayed one tiny bit
Just love the concept of NET illegal immigration
IE illegals flow back & forth
& Govt. keeps a tally of  both
& ignored things like 3 people die each hour of opioid overdoses. Let's hide under the bed from the Boogeyman.
I agree!
DT incites & pays no attention to security breifings-- if he lets them in his circle. He's dangerous!
â€œIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it".
 Joseph Goebbels
republicans are living in a falsified bivouac
nailed it
@willwilkinson ...we've got troubles, right here in River City...
.@JustinWolfers and related to that, here's what the effective corporate tax rate has been doing: http://myf.red/g/cPCr 
@SarahSpain "almost no one"? How many until it is a problem.
Big IMAGINARY solutions to imaginary problems
@BillShein And white racist terrorism has been given new life by #PresidentBannon but is ignored by policy & covered up
I thought it was illegal immigrants, not all immigrants. Do you understand the difference?
Paramount point
@SMShow Is that the mess he says he inherited? Prez Obama would have loved 2 have had that mess 2 deal with.
more like imaginary solutions to real problems
@marcylauren Imaginary problems are the only ones he can solve!
@hwkane yup
@Rosie
@nutrageus and the 64 billion will keep it that way.
obviously the people who voted do. This idiocy must stop, sincerely Canada
Worms like some apples. You don't like worms. I'm going to solve the problem by cutting down all the apple trees.
President Donald Quixote
They do solve the problem of how to make the rich richer.
@AC_Bravo if it ain't broke, tell everyone it is. Repeatedly. Until they believe you.
Trump will then take credit for fixing something that wasn't broken in 1st place & make himself a hero
Also imaginary solutions to big problems.
@wodelic what solution do you speak of?  I heard grandiose campaigning to conflated problems.
right...we live in paradise...


Garry there are people who should not have access to a firearm, we have always been able to restrict firearms
@SarahSpain you think our economy is booming?
@SarahSpain you think creating a more agile 21st century educational system that empowers its consumers is not an issue?
@SarahSpain you think an infrastructure plan to rebuild our roads & bridges is an imaginary problem?
@SarahSpain you think the rises of insurance premiums and deductibles across the country is an imaginary problem?
@JoyAnnReid b/c he has NO solutions to REAL problems...
don't forget they're imaginary solutions...
@arthur_affect but he spoke in a toned down way! And he praised a widow like a normal president, therefore it was great!
The @POTUS speech failed to address the terrible environmental degradation of #FraggleRock
perception is "reality"
@saintwarrick @willwilkinson if u don't think our infrastructure is fucked then u have never traveled this country for work
@JoyAnnReid @willwilkinson raise your hand if you are shocked by the theme of trump's speech?  Anyone?
What speech? I was too busy doing things to wait around to criticize someone...#getagrip
Having an open dialog is great even if our views are different
@Gift2USA
**theme of the presidency. I think you summed it up.
.@JustinWolfers @willwilkinson And then @realDonaldTrump closes w/ "...not burdened by our fears." His campaign & admin are based in fear.
Isn't that the official motto of the Republican Party?
@JoyAnnReid that way, when nothing happens, he'll take credit for it all
well said.
@JoyAnnReid just like the nationalist fascist he is
This was trump's "Fix it until it's broken" speech.
@JoyAnnReid @willwilkinson Exactly 
Don't sell him short. He also offered imaginary solutions to big problems.
@JoyAnnReid  #TheTruth
@JoyAnnReid   Easier to have great results to imaginary problems.  Helps to keep us winning.
@JoyAnnReid Justin remember they have #Alternativefacts as their sources.
paid with monopoly money
@JoyAnnReid And inadequate solutions to actual problems.
@willwilkinson and also: Imaginary solutions to big problems.
and zero mention of global warming
@JustinHaugens big problems for small hands
did you forget obamas hope and change a lot of hope very little change
@willwilkinson did you tweet that from your "safe room"? 

#libs-suck
unicorn poaching is on the rise #TrumpProblems
@jeffarr07 @willwilkinson worst tweet I've ever seen. Tell that to at least 1 terror victims family. NY times, lower than low
@ChrisPaulComedy not to mention imaginary solutions to big problems.
@sallykohn this is a joke
@sallykohn which is a stark contrast to Obama's admin: imaginary solutions to real big problems
Great solution to a HUGE problem, Impeach and Replace the President, VP and Spkr of House
but fake news!
@WolfmanZack415 @willwilkinson 

The 3 clowns...fear mongering lying con artists
It's like our president has been captured by the lies of Fox and RW news, no wait, it's not "like," it is the case.
Funniest Feisty Pets Pranks!
