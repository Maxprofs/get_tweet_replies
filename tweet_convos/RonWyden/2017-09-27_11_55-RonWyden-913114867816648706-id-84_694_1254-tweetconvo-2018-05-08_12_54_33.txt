Stay tuned for more fact-checking of Trump’s tax claims at 3:20 pm ET!
So full of crap. What about this @realDonaldTrump
It’s true. It’s also one of your major sources of information.
Its true, you're just owned by the healthcare industry
Of course, it cannot be true. Trump breathes lies like O2, the saddest thing,he believes his lying mind.  Impaired thought process
Do not believe Trump, lies all the time.
Of course it isn’t true. Trump opens his mouth, out fall the lies.
How do we know you don't benefit @realDonaldTrump? SHOW US YOUR TAXES!
Yep more lies.
Always a qualifier "I think"  Trump doesn't think. "Believe Me" in trumpspk means check fine print does exact opposite in bill
He is BLOTUS. I just expect that the truth is the opposite of what he says.
Who cares what he "believes," or how strongly he believes it. It either does or doesn't and he can easily prove it be sharing tax returns.
Call him a liar every chance you get because no matter what he say, he is lying. Its easy and it will change the narrative
Big surprise Senator. Everything that comes out of djt's mouth is a lie.
@toshea66 And as others have said, how would we know if DT benefits since he hasn't released his taxes?
A pol lying to push thru legislation? Shocking! Guess I didn't really have to change my Hc provider, my dr. and my premium went down
I am ashamed you are a US Senator...let alone my representative.
If only we could trust the New York Times. Sadly, we have learned we can't.
As my dad used to say, "He talks just to hear his head roar."
By now, we ALL know this person can not tell the truth. Everything he says is a lie!
@realDonaldTrump supporters will refuse to get this. Anyone who expects truth from him needs to have their head examined. #TrumpTaxScam
Only shock is that people are shocked that they all lie whenever there lips are moving. I guess people only care when the other guy lies
I suppose he means their tax rate will be very, very little now.
It's barely English.
Maybe his idea of "little benefit" translates into "Because I don't get 100% of all money".
@realDonaldTrump doesn't benefit from tax cuts because he doesn't pay federal income tax. Can't cut more than $0.
The Reveal? The Tell? 
"I don't benefit."
"He thinks" but does not know? OMG
You're getting your facts from the failing NYT's? Keep on dividing Ronny.
We've been under trickle down since Reagan in 1980's and it's sill not working. GOP thinks we are stupid: well we aren't just they.
Thank you -  I say " No Taxation without Representation.  And Americans should do as well   I M O
He doesn't even use good grammar when he lies.
@realDonaldTrump YOU ARE LYING!  Stop LYING!
Time for him to release his tax returns or no deal!
Astonishing how this man lies. More astonishing, how much BS his base believes. Even more astonishing, the GOP has no spine to stop this!
I call Bullshit!
Already lying about his tax plan. Making up catchy sound bites.  No surprise. Need to see his taxes. @realDonaldTrump
No shit Sherlock
Thank you for quickly and directly calling out #Trump when he lies. This is necessary if our democracy is to survive. #GOPTaxPlan
WAKE UP
AMERICA
THIS IS A
SLEEPER!!!

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO VOTE
Can we count on the Senate to make it true?
If people of wealth don't benefit...how do the people of wealth get wealthy?
As opposed to all of monumental truths that the Dotard in Chief has muttered.
Just more lies as usual.
Tax breaks 4 small biz? DeFazio has Lift the Public Plan that makes any biz partially tax exempt. Simple change to IRS code. Helps everyone
the operative word here is 'think'.....not your strong suit @realDonaldTrump
Most of what you say isn't true, exaggerated, or a lie based on appealing to emotions. As my senator, Ron, you lack credibility on much.
Why should we trust you. A do nothing senator that rather play politics than fix the ACA that is failing.
Of course none of this is true. tRump is incapable of telling the truth
No news here. Nothing #Trump says is true. What's next? Water is wet...?
U are billing frauds & practices of arrest to justify Treason & human trafficking witnin @DeptofDefense u see mi codes a woman©™®Arrest
Just another in a long line of lies by our so called President.
He lies so effortlessly. It's really quite astounding.
If you like your Dr, you can keep your Dr, bahaha!!!!
I think someone's, @realDonaldTrump, nose is going to grow. He never tires of the grifting and lies...sighhhh.

Can we force Trump to have a proper, lengthy news conference on #TaxReform? (Complete with running corrections, of course.)
Please rephrase to say clearly that Trump is LYING.
Another tRUMP lie nothing new.Unite as a nation come together do what's right for our country.WAKE UP before it's to late.
Oddly enough this is why he fails. The 35% of America that voted him into office cannot aid his legislative agenda. He doesn’t get it.
Well the dead give away there was when Donnie said "I think"
Like everything else, the Democrats are spinning everything because they are using lame excusses in order to obstruct as usual.
I think that our society has become so lame that they believe anything the  Democratic idiots say.
If we're not careful, this capitalistic society that we now enjoy will end up disintegrating before our eyes if Bernie Sanders gets his way.
This idea is hysterical! I don't need to read @nytimes to smell this BS!
But this is:
Here is the truth right here, people. READ THE TRUTH:

How do you know it't not true? Wishful thinking? Others swear they heard him.
@DemWarRoom @DemGovs @FBIWFO @ChelseaClinton
@RepMaxineWaters @TeaPainUSA

FLIP⚌
BernieHRC45…
Or grammatically correct. My 5th grade teacher would have had a field day with her felt pen in corrections and grading.  "F" START OVER.
He doesn't benefit..... That's a lie!
His kids will sure benefit from elimination of the estate tax
Particularly the2 who tried to screw Tiffany out of her inheritance. Not that I'm a fan of Tiffany. Just saying.
I didn't read it, but I agree if it's from the @nytimes that "none of this is true".. Should be on their Header
It appears you apply your “I didn’t read it” strategy a lot, considering your TL.
Thank you Senator Wyden for standing not only for Oregonians in DC but for ALL AMERICANS.  I am so proud you are my senator.
He said he doesn't benefit means he does. He's a liar, cheat and snake.
I nailed this morning with my tweet that this would labeled as s tax break for the rich
Prove it.  Let us see your taxes.
he could settle it by releasing 20 yrs of tax returns ..
He absolutely benefits with elimination of amt.
Thank you Senator for telling the truth! We stand behind you!
