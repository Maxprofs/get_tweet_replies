The FCC regulates interstate (between states)  50 states, the FCC are appointed by the President & confirmed by the Senate.
b'cuz they afraid of free speech.  They want to control who you talk to and what you see...
Just like North Korea and China
As an American the right to have freedom on the Internet should be an Amendment to the Constitution
Comcast owns msnbc. Maddow, Hayes, Reid etc, aint touching this bc Comcast pays em BIGLY. They are not your friends, people on this & more.
everyone's got a boss, right?
But w a boss like Comcast dominating the internet w price gouging & dictatorial control, msnbc's "liberal" heroes, ain't neither of those.
Ain't them who's about to fuck up either whether they cover it or not. Why redirect it to them from Trump? Oh well trolls suffer also.
Try killing a weed w/out going at the roots. Trump's a pos, but he wouldn't of happened if the Ds had been a strong&fierce opposition party.
You mean he wouldn't HAVE happened if Republicans hadn't spent decades being lying to & manipulating their constituents.
thank you brahs...please save the #libtards from having to accept they're losers. please, they need more fake Russia stories!
Let's remember, if you're old enough, the Ma Bell monopoly. If you're not old enough, look it up.
Ma Bell happened because of govt regulation. Regulations always come with significant compliance costs making startups unable to compete.
I though it happened because of monopolies.
Ma Bell became a monopoly because govt regulations kept everyone else out of the business. Nobody could compete.
What's that Stuart Smalley?
You KEEP getting it wrong... For the sake of quick hits. https://www.wired.com/2014/06/net_neutrality_missing/amp/ …
Quick hits? There was no URL with that tweet. That Wired piece is 3 yrs old. Same author wrote this a year later.
4/ ...Without consideration for how the technology actually works will create another sleep of bureaucratic mess.
*pile... Not sleep
Except this is how it has always worked! The Internet has always been neutral.
The ISPs want to choke out small business. How do you reconcile that with free market. That is purely anticompetitive.
http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/13/obama-gives-away-internet-and-it-our-liberty/ … these men are liars and had this planned from the start
This is so important!! Thank you for explaining net neutrality in this video.
These old idiots don't even know how the internet works, sigh. Constitution of the internet? OMG.
Wyden? Complete fool.
Now, if ppl make sense rearranging those previous tweets, they're > skilled than I. Good on ya.
 Just hit my button [clearly labelled 1stA]
Didn't have to listen to the final few minutes to grab this and throw it onto Facebook.
...Commercial TV(media) sells us stuff [loudly protesting public media] & has even conned us into paying them to sell us stuff.
@PChidambaram_IN Plz watch this video & read:

This is geat but is there anything we can do to help? Sign a petition, call a specific person(Representitive?) Or anything else?
Here's some info on action:
A second good site for info + ACTION on saving Net Neutrality:
Net Neutrality: What You Need to Know Now: http://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now …
Just came from that site and called earlier lol. Thank you though.
FCC GOV controlled agency & Special interests,only have a voice, when they control Politicians with money. Stop blowing smoke up our asses!
Crazy.  Less regulation is cornerstone of GOP.  How does this fit?  #freetheinterwebz
Homeland: big company paying bots would have its opinions shown first, so they could create a false public opinion to push forward whatever
watch this! act accordingly
You look for a job today using the internet and that would be changed where your access to the job market will be reduced and controlled
Good luck with that Big Business lol,first the hackers will have a field day with you , then the consumers will add you to malware lists
Senators I am behind you for various reasons but the one that is the most powerful to me is freedom
... for that, too.
 We must claim the rights to fair competition & let all sorts have the opportunity to sell us stuff.
@FCC keep your friggen hands OFF OUR INTERNET. @SenFranken @SenKamalaHarris HELP! SPREAD THE WORD PPL #HANDSOFFOURINTERNET !
As even a teenager can point out, what will that do to commerce if the little guy doesn't have equal access to the internet?
Ooh this bad territory
...Folks, this issue is perhaps only 2% less important than voter suppression.
  This admin. is covering for all*kinds* of crooks.
Folks, this issue is perhaps only 2% less important than voter suppression.
 [D.Jr's fate rates abt 37% or less on my importance scale. ...
These people are trying to save anything but their own interest
Why do we need to pay an internet ACCESS FEE to go where, we want? We should be able to contact competitors, independently, without a fee.
You know it's a bad day when the old birds of Congress are having to bring awareness to technology problems.
Yeah wait until the day you drop your cocaine in the snow......
It's amazing the greed of people. I will cancel my internet along with others. Everyone will lose.
Of course that are bad news for all the normal people!!! Now, what's to do???
Change it, or get rid of it.
Imagine a highway lane taken only by people who paid $100,000 per month, and you're picturing the future that @comcastcares wants.
It's truly free enterprise with all it's good and bad
Wrong they are trying to destroy the internet!
Every damn day it is something new the #GopKleptocracy is doing or going to do to limit the rights of ordinary Americans.
IMO..if we can focus on the vote..if the resistance would target that, we could bring change and soon. 1.
they are trying to save it . Like we should trust them??? remember ACA and how we were lied to!!
That's against the law. It's called a monopoly and or Laissez-faire. Illegal. That would monopolize one aspect of the market.
@russellcrowe 2/2 I am glad I am no longer associated with this party. They are not what they once were. 
Not since JFK.
@russellcrowe Ed Markey, John Kerry and Ted Kennedy, RIP,. I used to go to political functions with them. 1/2
@a35362 what action can we take to save net neutrality?
Lol

Net Neutrality: What You Need to Know Now:
Net Neutrality...just another Way the GOP and Trump Admin. Is Selling us down the river! WAKE UP AMERICA!
Thank you @SenMarkey, @RonWyden, @SenFranken
TAKE ACTION + get more info about Net Neutrality here:
the democratic senators do nothing unless it's for them.They do nothing for this country or it's people.Stop the hate and lies
This is as important as if someone was trying duck tape your mouth and silencing any opposition. 
THIS IS IMPORTANT!
Support and Speak your mind on this issue people! iI hope everyone will retweet this! Our democracy depends on freedom of speech!
Hallelujah!
Oh fuck the Internet. Just a marketing tool & nest for fucking scoundrels.
Get government out of my internet!  Per usual they give it a nice name like "net neutrality" which the liberal sheep love despite reality
Chris Evans.. Thanks
these senators should all be put out to pasture!
GOP thinks US is 1 big business deal Thzzzzzz on them
I support & thank all of you for giving us this warning & the tools to fight against it! Thank you.
Awesome post!
They want to squelch social media so we're divided.
If these guys are helping, we should all be afraid, very afraid
Thank you for informing us!
This is an extreme overgeneralization of the issue but yes we need to protect net neutrality at all costs.

Jesus. H. Christ
let me make it easy basically w/o net neutrality Verizon could slowdown Netflix if Netflix doesn't payup and speed up their own "netflix"
So Netflix gets to be a free rider on someone else's system? Then Verizon needs to beef up its system and passes the cost on. Difference?
@perlmutations when are they going to get that net neutrality is what we want!
Senators have you read this article? https://www.wired.com/2014/06/net_neutrality_missing/amp/ … tweeted by @burnetteddy
Hahaha...I love it..
What happened to free trade? I thought U.S. Was open for business..Are we being screwed in every orifice by corporate America? You SOBTCHES!
Leave it to @SenFranken to always get a chuckle out of me.
Al Franken is hilarious!!
This is a good video.

#NetNeutrality ftw.
@alfranken is a joke!
Everyone should consider and understand internet neutrality. Every person and every business should be equal in the free internet space.
... Tall people as well. And our Oregon dude, Ron Wyden! He's a good one for real.
The internet equalizes all of ours' access to info.  We can't let commercial businesses decide our INFORMATION POICIES.  #callyoursenators!!
I can't believe this is even a thing! #InternetForAll
Love Franken.....he's a badass and he's funny.
Ok but who can you really believe now a days
U know whom is really behind this? Trump, figures less of his Enemies can use the internet more of the real truth wont come out on him.
Thank you @RonWyden . @JoyAnnReid  @ChrisCuomo @jaketapper
I knew that.   Its been obvious
Hahahahh @MintMilana you have a cameo in this serious vid. ;)
This is insane...
Follow me please please please please
I like these guys across the board.
The FCC chair is the same guy that has ok'd sell of our private info by the cable companies, same guy who wants 2 make USA 3rd world country
Everyone needs to pay attention to this.
These men are babbling like idiots using sound bytes but with no substance
Check this one out , cool 
Net neutrality is a must!
Thanks for the awareness
#Screwtallpeople  @SenFranken is just great lol

Stay the course
#AuthoritarianRule #FascistBigotRule Secret Bills trump Russia #moneylaundering #voterOpression
the only thing an ISP can do is slow traffic down.  you cannot make 1's and 0's on a fiber optic wire go faster than the speed of light.
It's Ma Bell by another name.
Ma Bell was not a natural monopoly. It was allowed to happen directly as a result of government regulation, not a lack of it.
Thank you senators, for defending net neutrality. I do want to say though... pls take some speech lessons? I'm just used to clear speakers
I cannot stand this!  It's biz as usual!Big corps swallow the little companies cuz the idea of competition scares them to death!!
Monopoly!
@firefox wait, wasn't this already solved? or was th plan not enacted yet? Ugh, this is absurd
Ending net neutrality is an attack on small businesses and entrepreneurship. Stagnation for us, while other nations embrace progress.
that means the end of internet for big business, that's akin to shooting oneself in the foot.
Yeah right. I'm sure they are
Can we have our President Franken now?
When will the government learn, you dont fuck with people's internet
trump is a child, he thinks its okay to break laws, like the internet law, and various others.
@perlmutations hmm you know like they've helped competition with local cable companies not made gov protected monopolies right
Where does it stop? When is it enough for these people?
Save us
Ty. Fight it. Don't quit
Look a CLOWN video. RAD- Rise Against Democrats. #MAGA
You got my voice as well!!!°
Thank you for your service to keep free speech and equality on the internet.
While they're at it, how about breaking up big ISPs so we get higher speeds for cheaper?  Would help @clgaming win worlds for America, IMO.
Net Neutrality!  
Keep the big business choke hold away! They already have too much influence! Yes to net neutrality please!!
This s awesome!!  Spread the word yo!
Thank you Senators!
Thank you ! Isn't it enough that three giant media companies now Control radio and TV in US!  Public interest anyone?
I didn't know that .. they come from every direction to silence us. George Orwell predicted it.
Another example of Ds working in the best interests of ALL AMERICANS.  @AjitPaiFCC @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP working for CORPORATIONS.
45 appointed a conservative to the FCC, it is no longer bipartisan. Why appoint someone to FCC yet  leave 100 + other positions vacant??
Thank you for becoming a very important spokesperson for sanity and fairness.
We still love your humor;a sense of humor helps us with Dump.
A big thank you to @RonWyden for leading the fight for #NetNeutrality.
Yea and if these people where with the @SenateGOP doing this you would be complaining about it
They don't care about the citizens. These are the same senators who want to collect taxes from internet purchases.
#FrankenforPresident
I stand behind these senators 100%
@EvangForTrump @TeaPartyOrg @LibertyULibrary @VFWHQ @AmericanLegion @foxandfriends @WomenGOP @MilitaryTimes @libertarianism @NascarfansNews
I hope Al runs for President someday. That would be glorious.
#TheInternet #WWW Needs to be a #FreeEnterprise, a #FreeMarket (if you will). Not one where #BigBanks or #Corporations can curry favor.
@MegNrdyFreakx3
DO NOT LET THE FCC TAKE OUR RIGHTS OF THE 1ST AMENDMENT AWAY. IT WILL BE JUST THE BEGINNING. STOP THE FCC NOW.

Trump agreed to testify under oath. Trump gave no specific to which agency. Every investigating agency can demand his testimony under oath. 
" ALL THAT IS NEEDED FOR EVIL TO TRIUMPH IS FOR GOOD MEN AND WOMEN TO DO NOTHING."
The internet is for the world! WorldWideWeb. I can't understand how companies, american or else have a say in worldly matters.
No, they're trying to destroy it.
It's ok...@comcast says it doesn't *currently* have plans to discriminate against data or sell your internet history. We can all feel safe
#AjitPai & #Comcast say they support #FreeMarket but they really support #Monopolies & oppose #Entrepreneurs . #NetNeutrality

Trump agreed to testify under oath. Trump gave no specific to which agency. Every investigating agency can demand his testimony under oath.

Passing this on!
American citizens don't really understand or care how hard ancestors fought.
@Rafaeslomejor @andreopines @youpaynow @MungoNGus @Drewsmama @scwtajail @DirtyOldBroad @stinarichard @TheBoostress @LynHarris @adirado29
Net neutrality must stay! The internet is should remain an open avenue for everyone!
@SenFranken love this guy!!
Our country is ruled by the Chinese and Indians in charge of our justice system and money. 3rdWorld+communists rule America the to Wall st.
I MUST AGREE on this issue with the Democrats. Hey, 1% greedy rich Thieves -Hands  off internet.
Amen thanks for sharing
This is the very very best way I've heard it explained.
Al Frankin is just too cool!
@SRuhle heard you talking about this on your morning show - This is a very good explanation of why Net Neutrality is important!
@zacharyebell Save it by having the government control it. ROFL
Do you want Comcast and AT&T to charge you more to access certain websites? They'll put a surcharge on  popular domains w/out Net Neutrality
From all the 'odd-inary' and the 'ordinary' people .. we love you Al!  Thanks to all of you in DC fighting for the American people ! 
Um, so what's the CALL TO ACTION?!?! The Senators need our help -- HOW?! Does Now This not have an editor who works on this stuff?
This sounds like Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly that SCOTUS ruled illegal. We must maintain *internet neutrality*
You mean censor it, right? That's what you meant...if you're being honest.
You seem confused. How is making all web traffic equal a form of censorship
Unfortunately the world is under attack by yes really"Aliens they have landed experts expressed great concerns"..
Well stop sucking and do something to stop it.
#NetNeutrality it's in the constitution free speech
This is why I'm so torn and why we need stronger 3-4 parties I have some beliefs that tend left and I have some on the right

You seem confused about what #NetNeutrality is. If you ask questions, maybe we can all help
No
No you aren't confused. Or no. You just like memes and don't want anything more substantial
