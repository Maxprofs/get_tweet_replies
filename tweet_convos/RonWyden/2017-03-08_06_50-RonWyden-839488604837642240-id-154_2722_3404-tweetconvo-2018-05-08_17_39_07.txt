No surprise, #Trumpcare relegates women to health care the GOP chooses.
No surprise, #Trumpcare gives health care CEOs a massive tax break.
No surprise, #Trumpcare tells low-income Americans to take a hike & pray you donâ€™t get sick.
No surprise, #Trumpcare is good for the healthy, the wealthy & not much else.
So what shall we do about it? #suxbeingpoor #UnAmerican (or is it? Corruption seems to be the new normal.)
Your hyperbole noted. @RonWyden @GregoryMcKelvey
?
TrumpdoesntCare
No suprise, Ron conducts class warfare again. Him against those intelligent enough to see an opening bid. #StupidOnPurpose again
show the numbers please.
Thank you Senator Wyden for speaking truth to power and for fighting the good fight!
.@RonWyden it's #putincare because trump has his name on enough crappy things already.
@ballerinaX while average millionaire get $55K tax cut, working class people get to lose their coverage!!
Call it #Republicare. They all deserve the credit.
I don't understand how everything can crumble with one idiot in office. Can you help me understand?
#GOP  rushing change before #TrumpRussia collapse!!
Thank you, Ron Wyden for watching our backs on this.
@TrueBlue_2016
you had 8 years to fix your whatever that was broke and you and all the dems fail badly and all you can do is cry.
TrumpW'healthcare
don't call it Trumpcare, he doesn't need more name branding  I propose #DumpCare or #RyanCare or #RepublicansDontCare
#unaffordacare
@JoyAnnReid the ALtGOP Heath care mockery must be stopped. It's basically a : Pull The Plug Plan #PTPP
or sit in your car while it's running in the garage with the door shut care.
Please be our voice. Please stand up to him/against him/resist him. I don't want to see my sons drafted. #resist
Or my grandsons or granddaughters #resist
That just aint gonna workm for much longer - robbing the poor to give to the wealthy. GOP rename: ReverseRobinhoodParty
I support you Senator and have since the 80s.  Keep fighting for Oregon!
@BeautyBind 
Republicrooks paying back PAC men with taxpayers money.
He also saves me 600 dollars a month for something I never use.  Suck it up Ronny. You lost.
Trumpcare will be the leading cause of death in America.
I'm no way rich and HC costs are out of control, something needs to change.
where in the hell do you get this number??? more fake news from democrats....ahca is what should have been passed 8 yrs ago
@theatrechick76 well damn, gonna have to get on with the day. Didn't take long to get pissed at these asshats. ttys
I think Ron Wyden is a good man actually. 
seems to be telling it like it is. I'll watch for him.
@farandwee   Like I said!!! Always follow the money!!!!
@WeAreUnitedUSA not trumpcare.  it's trumpussycare.
- Dishonest Donnie just making America great again.  Just like 1890. Racism, robber barons. What a great place!  Thanks Donnie!
#Trumpcare. Let's make the 1% RICHER off the backs of middle/lower income
Drain Trump's Swamp!!
How Republican of them!
Republicans never deviate from their agenda to break the the back of labor. This is not new!
@JoyAnnReid With #Trumpcare the poor get sicker & die quicker,  while the rich get richer & the deficit gets thicker.  Truly GOP.
I saw another account recommend we call it #TrumpDontCare
please call it #Republicare
@AgitatorsNeeded  No surprise at all.
dumpcare
@mrb00mbastick feel like Dems are spreading themselves too thin, get this admin out,by exposing Russian connections,then attack
perhaps we should call it #Trumpdoesntcare
TrumpCare will kill me because I have asthma and without good insurance I will not be able to afford my medications. No DNR for me.
@grouperpro well then the rich need to build the wall.  They don't need my money.
@CarlaMoulton3 did we ever expect anything less from republicans than to come up w/ plan to line the pockets of the rich?!?
@idnov They feel better already.
it's their money, not the government's , Mister Communist
Had to count the zeroes.
Trump just made a swamp that truly needs draining.
"tax cut" lol. That's like me stealing your car, then bringing it back to you and saying "Surprise, I bought you a car"
- well, duh...
@JoyAnnReid @Lawrence 
This was a GOP meeting in the middle of the night. GREAT JOB PAUL RYAN. I'll remember on election day.
@trumpcare the Trumpites need to be stopped before they dismantle our government
All I want is a fair and affordable plan to stay healthy and get help when I'm not. It seems like I'm asking for too much.
tell the people loudly why Paul Ryan is wrong! Don't let them push flawed health plan thru.
Now your finally you admitting that Obama Care was a tax!!!
Please protect Oregonians who are on Medicare & Medicaid. Can Oregon support them w/o federal help? We R frightened beyond belief.
Obamacare was a tax on middle America and a way to bankrupt America. By the way this Paul Ryan's bill.
@kharly Or..the first GOP withdrawal from the medicare/medicaid system..! Next..!
@jasonabbate They can buy so many iPhones now
@SenateDems #CONCare
They have no compassion for the poor. They're all rich & greedy! Devil driving GOP bus.. & I hope it drives straight into hell.
.@RonWyden I'm too much of a simpleton to understand money. So, #howmanysmartphonesisthat? #HealthCareIniPhones
@TheEllenDumm Say it isn't sooooooo!
it's no better or worse than the ACA.  Allow competition across state lines, limit damages in malpractice cases, prob solved.
Yes, repair best. Sadly, it seems @GOP can't allow that after so many years, 60? votes to repeal, running on it. @RonWyden
both sides are just pandering and get nothing done to our detriment. Get money out of politics and #termlimits
@wokehillbilly Donald's family going to get them some of that?
Still unclear if he pays taxes.
More fake news. Same false arguments!Get govt OUT of our healthcare!!
@MelindaCaskey TrumpNoCare is a more accurate name for the proposed replacement of Obamacare.
@grumpyoldman418 

I thought It was 2 trillion...
You voted for Obamacare it's failing Could not even set up plan in Oregon it failed....     an Oregon voter
Well, they did take "affordable" out of the name so I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
@SenateDems Stop with the babbling and negotiate.
No surprise at all..
Blow purple smoke Due to socialism collapse I see. If you were an American at heart I would care. Socialism Sucks
@Toure - gee, how are they planning on paying for it then?
@SenateDems it's always that way Americans suffer while the line their pocket
It's obscene! What would make @GOP think they could sell this piece of garbage! #resist
That means Obamacare was a $275,000,000,000 tax on the rich
@SenateDems Well sure am glad the richest Americans will be taken care of y make money too. The starving struggling were worried!
@SenateDems Was it surprising to find out the Obama administration was so corrupt?
#wealthcare, #trumpdontcare, or #trumpnocare. Don't reward him by using a name he'll be fine with.
Repeal and Replace the GOP!
BTW STOP HONORING ANY NEW HEALTH BILL WITH THE NAME TRUMP! We have the American Care Act, no nickname needed.
@SenateDems @RepMimiWalters NOOOO WAY
Even @randpaul says big NO to that!
@PrincessBravato No time for polite discourse. Innocent people will be hurt This is inexcusable and the money behind it criminal.
Wow, welp I hope my death is worth it~
And what was the figure of ACA the largest tax increase in American history. OK to raise, not cut. Spending problem.
timeline. @MarkRuffalo @RussiaConnects block blood forbidden IPO basis is Death! Life only on market @usda food differ
Quick with the words, show the proof of these numbers. Twitter use at it's worse!! Lying without repercussions! MAN UP & put out the proof!
@SenateDems expected nothing less from GOP after all they have to protect their donors!!
@SenateDems That's not going to work for IL-16 voters @RepKinzinger.
-GOP esthetic 2take BO,s name off anything- Racists fucks!- Ryans crew sendin us in2 emergency rooms 2 take a # & wait 2die
@SenateDems wow! Let's just scrap Obamacare without replacement.
Please call it Republicare.  They must all own it--make them accountable in 2018!
I have been writing Ryan and Walden and others who are pushing this scary trumped up version of ACA on us.  What else can we do?
@JoyAnnReid @SharonPetrick on the backs of the poor, as usual.
@AnnH1958  While Rep Mo Brooks AL tells @CNN that it's biggest welfare bill ever sponsored by Repubs.  Cruel but not cruel enuf
isn't that an entitlement
@JoyAnnReid  that's a lot of zeros
Ron that is a despicable lie. 1/3 of ALL US counties with NO ACA coverage now. you know that ..STOP HATING AMERICANS.
How about those of us who don't choose western medicine? Can we have equal insurance access for alt. medicine providers?
Fake News
Go read it! You won't be able to make that claim after you do
.@ronwyden @michaelawoodjr We must stop Trump, Ryan, and all the other hogs at the trough. Impeach Trump.

@JoyAnnReid curious, for every poor folk who dies, how much does that increase wealthy tax advantage per body? #PullThePlugPlan
Perhaps once #TrumpRussia is unraveled,we can have more normal political discussions, and fix things that are actually broken?
@BranBrez the rich get richer. No war but class war!
Didn't you know, if you give back money to the wealthy, poor people will benefit?

#Itsgoodtobetheking
ssurree!!
And we haven't even started in tax reform yet!
That's $275 billion. With a 'b'. Or $2.75*10^11 if you prefer scientific notation. And now of it's paid for.
@JoyAnnReid shocked.  Shocked I say.
just shows republicans don't care abt the elderly and low income ppl.iphone or health care shows how out of touch they r 2world
wow! Like they need a tax cut! Shame on the Republicans! They will bankrupt our country!
No wonder doctors & more are against it. Will end up treating less people, earning less, medical industry unemployment will go up.
Counters GOP claim of wanting 2 get more Americans back 2 work. It will create less jobs not more bcz people can't afford med care
Exactly
I find the idea that I support the 1% out of my monthly discretionary income as cruel. Why am I less deserving?
why not call it #GOPCare? This is a failure for the entire incompetent, misbegotten, venal party
Funny I thought "No Surprise" Ron sold out progressives for Hillary only to turn around and blame Russia.
Rip Seth Rich RIP

@JoyAnnReid If I "like" this post it does not mean I support it
middle class family costs of ins and care goes way, way up (which you like) under #ACA.  Now fams get tax help, and you don't like
you'll pay 5x as much as me because of your age if this passes, enjoy!
so the family you married in to will be receiving a tax cut? More for u in the will right
It's a scam.It's pretend caring, economics, and governing. Tinkerbell will sprinkle #Trumpcare with pixie dust so it will fly.
#dumptrump #makeamericasickagain Thank you Senator Wyden!!!!
@JoyAnnReid its DonTCare. Please call it what it is.
wolf cryer
PLEASE DO NOT CALL IT TRUMPCARE. He gets no credit for being a puppet!
your proof he's a puppet? Stop repeating msm bullshit.
.@RonWyden @JoyAnnReid and some Republicans say it doesn't go far enough. smdh.
@JoyAnnReid Call it Republicare. They are all complicit.
Or "Republinotcare". Or more to the point: "Tax Cut for the Wealthy".
To be fair, if the Republicans won't bail out the richest people, who will?
Don't the poor and frail matter anymore? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
Please dont give in to him and his Russian cohorts.  He's out for himself and his buddies. STOP HIM before he destroys America.
@TheatreChick76 Try presenting this information to a trumper and see what you get back. 
how is this real life?
The rich get richer on the backs of the poor every time there is a GOP president. How do their supporters not see this?!?
The same way people don't see that the rich ALWAYS get richer at the expense of the poor. Always have. Always will.
Please do everything you can to GET HIM OUT.
