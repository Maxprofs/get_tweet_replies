@SenateDems DEMS ARE AGAINST ANYTHING TRUMP WANTS..Most hateful people on Earth
this reminds me of when R's where against everything BO wanted. The 2 party's are to blame!
and obviously doing what we have been doing doesn't either!!
so support the status quo and the teachers union because it's working so well...?
Sen. Wyden,  If we, the Dems cannot block Devoss of all appointees, how can we stop anything the R's want to do? What is plan B?
plan B?      Bwahahaha.  There is no plan B because Ron and Harry Reid voted to eliminate the option.  Can't do squat.
Thank you for standing up for public education!
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION, THE CORNERSTONE OF DEMOCRACY, SENATOR WYDEN.  WE ARE PROUD TO CALL YOU OUR SENATOR.
true, bc anyone in public will not get the ED they deserve
Public education has failed students, but it's really good at spending money. http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/ibd-migrated-images/ISS3_111101.png â€¦
thank you thank you thank you thank you
Lying again I see. School choice is a vast majority of non profit schools. Parents demand truth in the education debate. deciever
Confirm DeVos. Stop your party politics and do what is best for Oregon and our broken country.
@SenateDems@ fightthemfightthemfightthen
Thank you for your hard work!
The @DNC picked Trump over Bernie, R Dems refuse to apologize and let Trump get away with installing the Wrecking Ball Cabinet?
Love you, Senator Wyden! Like you always tell me, "Keep fighting the good fight!" #RiseLoveResist
#OregonHero #SenatorWhoCaresAboutThePeople

This is the most frightening thing about this whole charade. Absolutely no senate check on Bannon and crew. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/828975579395477504 â€¦
we can tell who on the right side, easy go outside meet the people and see smiles.
i work @public school (3different 1s)it a  liberal arts joke.if your kid is special needs or ap your good the kids inmiddle play-
. -sports or music. Plays.and   opt out of tests.its a  Absolute mess we run the kids aroud for 6hrs. Then send home. To
play video. Games btw 90% of public schools budget goes to teachers and staff and whats left on the students. #joke
And you believe that public (aka government) schools have given children that chance?! What planet do you live on?!
good job. Your work to get these appointees properly vetted has been great, we need more dem strength and coordination #NOTRUMP
Ridiculous. Thank you for trying. Please co sponsor Feinstein SB 274. We have to keep moving forward!
it's irrelevant who is SOE. Until KIDS and PARENTS VALUE education, there will be no improvement
.....or maybe.... YES???
You've been on fire since January 20th! Thank you! Keep their feet to the fire! #noDevos #NoBanNoWall
The American people want this. They have spoken. Public schools are disaster.
Plagiarism has no place in our schools or government---neither do those who engage in such acts of dishonesty! No on DeVos!
Thank you for taking a stand for education
Thank you sir.
Thank you, Senator Wyden. Best, a Portland elementary education teacher.
So proud to have you as my senator! #StopDeVos #HoldTheFloor
@SenateDems thank you for fighting for our children. Betsy DeVos is unqualified!
Thank you! Proud to have you as my senator.
Thank you! Keep it up!
Wahoo! Our Wyden! You look great out there doing what you were really meant to do. I notice you love the good peoples! No On DeVos
, thank you for opposing this nomination. Having $$ & caring about 1 type of school doesn't qualify #DeVos to support all schools.
Students in Oregon and throughout America thank you! When are you having a Town Hall near NE PDX? Would love to attend.
yes it will freedom of education choice for everyone not just elitist dems who think they are better than us
Thanks for fighting for my daughter's right to a quality public education. #NoOnDeVos Keep up the fight for all of us. =)
Go Ron. I'll be a donor for YOU (small ). #NoOnDevos #NoOnDeVos
Yay! Thank you Senator!
So the Obama plan to pump billions into failing public schools - how did that work out?
Thanks! I hope dems can stop this. DeVos is unbelievably unqualified for this position. Shameful that she could buy in like this.
FYI, Sir, we are fundraising to support oppo cands to run against any R who votes for Devos. $3.5m pledged in PA so far.
Thank you!
yes! A robust public education system is the backbone of a democracy & a necessity for anyone wanting the American Dream!
The status quo won't either. I don't know about DeVos, but choice or vouchers can be implemented in such a way as to help students
Good job!
phone lines busy tweet em https://twitter.com/gov/lists/us-senate/members â€¦?

@SenateDems You deserve DeVos not passing so U can continue to dumb down the Democrats Plantation but she will pass & begin 2 fix
Thanks for supporting the unions rather than each individual child.
Thank you! Keep up the good work!
I'm originally from Eugene, but now a Seattlite, I'm grateful for the spirit of the Pacific Northwest #goducks
Thank you senator. We need an education expert who at least understands testing & measurement. Keep it up!  #NoOnDeVos
And who won't use taxpayer money for private schools!
#holdthefloor â€œ@RonWyden: Making it loud & clear... : #NoOnDeVos. 
Privatizing public edu. will not give every child the chance to succeed"
Thank you for representing us here in Oregon!!!
@SenateDems yes because the way the public schools have been teaching kids according to progressives had been creating geniuses
@SenateDems How bout you spend 24 hrs actually talking to your R colleagues and persuade 1 w/a scrap of integrity to vote No??
@SenateDems why not privatize schools? Make them compete for students.
Thank you!
@SenateDems call out Johnny Isakson! He is not listening to his constituents! Georgia does not want Betsy Devos. We call we write
@SenateDems privatizing education is a vote for unions, unions don't care about children's education, follow the money
Um, "unions don't care about children's education" - you mean like the teachers' unions?  Agreed ;) ...
thank you, Sen.Wyden. Please shake some sense into those Republicans
.@RonWyden @SenateDems  But it can't hurt as much as the status quo.
All the Dems are making "loud & clear" is that they are sniveling idiots. Embarrassing.
#HoldTheFloor #NoOnDeVos Thanks Dem Senate! We are with you.
@SenateDems impeach the problem
@SenateDems fight Dems who are bought by NEA union money & afraid of busting up their monopoly.  Support school choice & DeVos!
WILL NOT ALLOW EVERY CHILD TO SUCCEED, WHAT IT WILL DO IS LET RICH MAKE MORE MONEY OFF THE BACKS OF OUR CHILDREN!!
@SenateDems as said by the teachers union. The only motivation here is to save the union, not the children. @realDonaldTrump
@SenateDems Thanks for taking a stand against Betsy DeVos, she's a total moron, and bribed her way to a nomination.
kids can't succeed without parents. The state is not a substitute for good parenting.
@SenateDems progressives can and do support public educational choices. Zip codes should not dictate quality of ed #CivilRight
@SenateDems Pay for play!  This is what it looks like.
@SenateDems does the current system? Don't need to delve into theory to prove current system fails many, mostly poor kids!

THANK YOU for standing up for public education
thank you for opposing Devos
I'm incredibly proud you are our senator!  Keep up the good work!
how much do the public sector unions contribute for this campaign? #YesSchoolChoice
Proud to call you my Senator! Keep fighting.
A large portion of Oregon doesn't support you.
Hey @senrobportman - not too late to join our in. @CbusIndivisible @OHDems
Keep up the good work. Proud to have you represent the people.
Nothing will. But will give a lot MORE children the chance. Thank you Senator from the state ranking 48 out of 50 in graduations.
honestly though, what about bears?
Thank you for your opposition to this obviously flawed candidate. No experience. No qualifications. Ties to private ed. business
Trump is incredibly dangerous. Incredibly dangerous! Itâ€™s obvious. Heâ€™s corrupt, heâ€™s unstable, heâ€™s reckless.
Davos is not going to privatize public education....pub ed needs reform with local mgmt and control instead of Washington
as a father of a child screwed over by medford schools, lied to about his progress because worthless teachers didn't want to deal
with his reading issues, I feel that you and your liberal ideas have failed our children and it is time for a change.
So proud to have you representing us!! #thankyouwyden #fororegon
Yes Ron we know you're working every day to prevent the loss of Federal control of the education purse strings & school standards
And u know this how? Oh yes that's correct, most public school student scores have been exemplary. Why not let parents decide?
thanks 4 being there
#DumpDeVos #BlockBetsy No Taxpayer Funded Christian Education. #FightLikeAGrizzly
How about no christian funded non taxpayers. Hmmmm?
you allowed Oregon to fall to the bottom in education.  You don't get a say
 Thank you, Senator, from one of your constituents. Devos is unqualified.
thank you #NotoDeVos #NoonDeVos #saveourschools
thank you for standing up for public education!
Thank you Senator Wyden. Protect our children and their schools.
thank you for being there to support my views sir!
Same!
Portland supporter here! Thank you for voting no on DeVos! #NoOnDeVos
and what have you done, besides beg for more money?
Thank You!
Thx Senator. This is, however, low hanging fruit. Pls also vote no on remaining nominees.
oh he will. He only votes party lines unless his NY constituents say otherwise
Sir, thank you for standing up for our children. Trump wants to take advantage of those who have no voice. Be their voice!
that's why nothing gets done, turds like wyden go and protest
Thank you Senator! I hope it works!
Thank you AGAIN Senator Wyden! ðŸ–’
please convince all constituents to deny DeVos and Bannon !! They are a danger to our Country
A real danger!
Thank you, @RonWyden - #BetsyDeVos is the most unqualified cabinet pick of all time! GOP is full of partisan hacks for supporting.
Also  full of hate.Look what thry are teaching our children..Riots and Violence in our streets.
Judging a group by its most extreme individuals would be like me saying all Trump supporters are racist. R U racist?
thank you  so very proud you represent me! 
He's getting MY campaign contributions.
thank you!
