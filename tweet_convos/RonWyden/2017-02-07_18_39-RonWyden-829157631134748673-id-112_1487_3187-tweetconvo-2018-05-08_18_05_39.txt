I am african american & liz doesn't speak for me I am tired of the race card being played for everything ..sickening
, we are lucky to have you in Oregon. Thank you for always having backbone-even when it is uncomfortable
thank you! We cannot let @SenWarren stand alone. I hope you spoke in support of her leadership on the floor and in the future.
Communists!
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!  You are a left wing nut job - disingenuous and deplorable.  Communist?
agree speak up more we need your focus on criminal acts going on like conflict of interests; treason with Russia, etc
What is GOP afraid of? #Warren? truth?
The uncomfortable truth, she violated the rules.
@SenateDems I want to hide. I am going to lose my mind. #ThisIsNotNormal
@SenateDems Hiding from doing ur job, boycotting hearings, lying on senate floor constantly, blocking cabinet picks, that is wrong
GOP naturally put forward conservatives. Couldn't they find any qualified and not corrupt liars?
No. Apparently.
oh please,we have had enough of her BIG mouth during the campaign .tired yawn
I am one of the weird democrat that wants Jeff Sessions
So what are you going to do about it?
Let Phonyhotas Speak! She lied to get Native American Preference @ Harvard when she wasn't Flipping Houses for 100% Profit
Liz broke the rules... ur rules... u should sit and color
Thank you Ron.
Will you support the RIGHT of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak "uncomfortable truths", or do only democratic senators have that right?
breaking rules is cool tho.... cause it's a dumbocrat, so all good
And so is using ones position to vilafy the will of the people. Resign!
it was a smear and it is a smear now
So get up there and read the King Letter! @seedywumps
Merkley read it. @senjeffmerkley
They all should read it! @RonWyden @SenJeffMerkley
I think the R's just made their new Nancy Pelosi.  BTW hi from Bruno George.
Please stop stalling and playing games in Senate. You are just making yourselves look like babies.
Thank you standing strong. I will send you a free t-shirt.  No joke. http://www.synchwear.com 
Such as?  Explain please?
You should tell that to Pocahontas!
You know, like how Hillary was a viable candidate... also WRONG
Thank you for always standing up for right.  #LetLizSpeak
Mr. Wyden with respect, your Clown Act is approaching the end of the line. Make sure you are using your Depends next election?

Thank you sir, for being a real man! Unlike those afraid of @SenWarren and the truth of Coretta Scott King.
Thats right it is very wrong. When people in the Senate don't even know who they work under.
WE live in 2017 not 1960 or even 1986! Gays can marry, blacks have it better than they have ever had it! Grow UP and start working
so your saying she was to use the time to come clean about unreported contributions
AMEN.. time to let some truth out under this ugly regime
you were quoted by @washingtonpost
the Senate has forgotten the first amendment to every American,  freedom of speech!
For the love of god man, what SHE did was WRONG. Plain. As. Day.
Warren was wrong in her approach.  McConnell responded correctly. U know this. Please stop partisanship.
Let us speak of all the pedophile sex trafficking in our city or is that too uncomfortable for you? 1 of those 70 warrants for you
I've appreciated your efforts so far but be aware that this Oregonian expects you to hold the line and back her up.
@SenateDems  Read the letter!
Sir, louder, longer and as if our lives depend on it. Time to step it up. Please.
.@RonWyden well said!
@SenateDems Please take the opportunity to read CSK's ltr and force R's hand to silence you all. That's where traction lies.
Tell us how we can help support you and Senator Warren in getting the real facts out to the public. You serve Oregon well, sir.
Saw you in Newport Saturday, Senator. Thank You for your service! #resist We're with you, in case you couldn't tell.
#LetLizSpeak Shameful what they did to silence truth. Let Liz speak!
shameful behavior by those who voted to silence the truth.
cmon. Get real whiner
I'm proud to be a "whiner" (your term) on behalf of those who speak the truth.
And here another uncomfortable truth comes tumbling out of the closet
@SenateDems  read the Senate Rules. You are not above them even if you think you are.
Like when DNC stole nomination from us (Bernie n most Dem voters)? DNC gave us Trump-they knew she would lose, still they stole it
Thanks for standing with our Senator!
We (the majority) are being overrun!! Help! #Fascism #Christofascism #Resist
Not uncomfortable truth...lies and slander!...Democrats motives these days and you sir are one of the worst...I left the party!
well don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you
Just because the great Coretta Scott King wrote a letter to Kennedy doesn't make her sentiments true.  Just her opinion.
Thank you for all you do, standing against the Bannon/Trump administration! Pick up the letter where she was stopped, please.
Thank you Sen Wyden's for your unwavering work on The Hill.
Seriously? U think this is good behavior? Wow.
yes, it is great behavior. Using the floor to attempt to sway R votes by spreading the truth. Rs stayed home. Sad.
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @CNN
Every Democrat in the Senate should read the same passage.  What's happening is appalling.
(@SenJeffMerkley) I'd like to have someone read King's letter on Sessions into the record the first day he is no longer a senator.
@LeslieMarshall then go down there and keep reading the letter
Stand up & yield your time to her.
So much grandstanding, so little time.  I wonder how long until the fundraising letter comes out.  8 hours?
@SenateDems the hashtag you have chosen is vomitus and @SenWarren Warren is a fake opportunist
@SenateDems Trend #LetLizSpeak is lame. Pissing off Democrats who expect you to tweet "I just got censored too"
@SenateDems The uncomfortable truth for Oregonians is that you ignore the conservative residents in your district.
The uncomfortable truth is libs don't even think there is another POV.
ronnie your ignorance is very unbecoming a senator which by the way is just below a used car salesman.
Please continue reading the letter! #letlizspeak
.@RonWyden I think you should pick up where she was stopped. Are you really outraged or not?
@LauraZigman #BREAKING the Ice: It is #relative #Truth  
She did it to herself by breaking a rule!
Will other Senate Dems pick up the #CorettaScottKing letter where @SenWarren left off?
Agree.  Wrote the same thing!
that's what racist do the guilty
THE @GOP should read the Bible they try to weaponize all the time especially Mark 4:22 #LetLizSpeak
many of the #GOP are our uncomfortable truths!
Whaaaat? U been drinking tonight?
Perhaps this blowback will galvanize a few of your R colleagues to vote Nay...
One can dream, right...
u talk to that terrorist in prison! Now arrest her.™©®
she needs to go to bed, tuck her in #ElectionsHaveConsequences
Women speak.  Mitch freaks. Mitch is afraid of voice mail in DC, but his Lexington office has voice mail: (859) 224-8286
well that mailbox is full now. I'm writing letters.
gop have not worked for 8 years. Why would we assume they would care to help our citizens, our nation now?
WHO hasn't worked in 8 years??? U need to look in mirror.
yes it is, practice what you preach!
why would she read a letter from 1986?
-Like residing in one state-new York-& legislating for another?I realize there R no rules 4 Radical Dems...like you-Whiner
idiocracy.
exactly-IDIOCRACY!!...love it-perfect description!

I agree.  Show us your tax returns.
Hiding from alternate facts is RIGHT!! #ImpeachTrump
the outrage is Dems doing everything they can 2 stop Trump they complained about gridlock in DC yet here they are doing just that
