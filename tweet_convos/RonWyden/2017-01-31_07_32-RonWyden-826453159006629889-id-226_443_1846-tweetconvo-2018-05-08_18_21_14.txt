The litany of ethics revelations regarding @RepTomPrice are strong evidence that he cannot be allowed to have control of #Medicare.
Mr. Mnuchin continued to fail to come clean on shady foreclosure practices that hurt Americans.
thank you for boycotting that sham of a vote. The @GOP just showed they'll break rules to install corrupt people for Trump.
thank you for standing up. Please join @SenJeffMerkley's move to Fillibuster supreme court nom!
Hilarious! Rethuglicans practiced obstruction for 8 YEARS! Wake up. @Devinitelybk @RonWyden @SenateFinance @SenJeffMerkley
What did the Rethugs in Congress accomplish in the last 8 years? @Devinitelybk @RonWyden @SenateFinance @SenJeffMerkley
Tomorrow you get out maneuvered by Orin Hatch. #psychic #theresistance #resist @RonWyden @SenateFinance
And yet, republicans are.
and how did that go for you?
Thank God Democrats are trying to do what Trump said he would do - drain the swamp.  Trump apparently loves swamps.
Sen, when did the USA become a tyranny? Repubs are trying me with the suspension of the rules.
Where is the law of our Land? Do something
we stand by you  stay strong!!!!   Boycott supported too
The nominees will be confirmed.
Leftists spreading their Marxist plague is an echo of Bolshevik & Menshevik subversion 100 years ago @RonWyden @AndyKindler @SenateFinance
no worries. They'll b approved n we'll hammer Dodd/Frank and that Obamacare pile of shit. Have a good day!!

Thank you for fighting for us
Why??
This is the courage Democrats have been waiting to see from our Representatives and Senators. Keep it up!
No surprise, you getting paid to do nothing. Shame on you for not even voting "present"!!!!
@KATUNews @SenateFinance the usual from Democrats - do nothing, get nothing done.  sick of it!
Democrats didn't "REFUSE" 2 move forward, they simply stayed away from their JOB instead of participating/objecting
Proud to be your constituent! Just read your statement, your VM is full, so I’m tweeting thanks! Ethics laws are not optional!
So proud you are my senator! Thank you for being all in with this fight!
Thank you, Senator Wyden! @SenateDems
Thank for for being a "no" for Mnuchin and Price today!
... Hold fast on this
And you are happy about that?
you should resign. You did not even go into room to further ask these questions. No call, no show, no job!
It's time Dems fought fire with Fire ! Great Move! 
Keep it up until the Committee votes them down. 
UNQUALIFIED

Please use everything you have at your disposal to stop this march of the religious right.

thank you! Keep fighting.
.@RonWyden @SenateFinance Thank you senators for standing up to this BS! My senators are too cowardly & spineless @SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn
Please tell me the rumors abound you being on the fence about Sessions aren't true. Tried to call, mailbox full.
Stop lying about Prez Trump's cabinet nominees. We voted & want our Prez to do his job. Get out of the way!
Bravo Dems!!

Well done Senator, proud that you represent me so well.
Thank you Sen Wyden for your leadership.  Proud to be an Oregonian today and everyday!

The audacity 4 Paul, Mitch, #45 to complain abt delays is vile #MerrickGarland Dems stand strong!
THANK YOU!! YOU SPEAK FOR US!  (from Indiana) (sorry about Pence)
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I live in NC. My senators are voting with Trump :(

THANK You. Keep it up!
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @voxdotcom
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you senator! Appreciate you being so vocal and supporting what is best for all of us.
@KATUNews @SenateFinance Small-minded, petty, dhildish people who don't speak for the majority! Sad..
that's fine. You don't count any more
Political Games Much??? Grow up & get over it!!! Y'all lost!!!
Good, no stay out. POTUS made Congressional staff sign NDA to pass a ban in secret. Check on power = shut it down
Thanks for doing your job!
Keep doing what you're doing! #resist
Thank you Sen. Wyden, we your stand on this. #indivisible #resist #obstruct
On the topic "Sanest thing in while"
Thank you Ron #resist the force is strong in this one - thx for being my senator
Thank you for standing up to illegal, immoral admin. Same for Tillerson, Pruitt, Sessions, Puzder, DeVos. #resist
the Dems do not have enough votes and are putting on a monkey show for their donors #pathetic #morons
dog and pony show
I support this action. Please continue to resist Trump's plan to destroy our country.
why?? they are qualified and deserve to be confirmed.  Your in the minority Sen. Wyden.
playing politics,do your damn job Wyden stop playing games.
thank you!
Thank you! Resist!
@SenJeffMerkley it really is frustrating that both OR senators completely ignore all but the liberal Democrats here. #ignoredinOR
THANK YOU for listening to us Senator!
thank you from a constituent. Relieved to see @TheDemocrats finding their backbone!
keep up the good work and thanks for standing your ground! Oregon u!
thank you for showing the rest of the Democrats what a backbone looks like
he's just doing what his constituents want.Thats how it works.
Thank you Senator Wyden for hampering confirmation of Price & Mnuchin
And so it continues - a big chunk of Oregon voters once again ignored by their Senators. Getting old. Many in OR disagree with you
well not enough!Guess you need to vote them out first.They represent their base. You don't
so, you would agree it's okay for a politician to ignore all but their base?
he goes with what the majority wants. That's how it works.
okay, then you're okay with what Trump is doing since he won a large majority of EC in the election? Same principle.
doesn't work that way. He's not r presenting the majority of the people. So no I don't.
Says who? POTUS is by EC, Congress is by pop vote and they won the majority, by pop vote. Time to listen to our side.
from Portland, thank you. Keep it up, we’re counting on you! 
@KATUNews @SenateFinance Stop DeVos & Sessions. Watch NSC closely
thank you!  Keep fighting!
excellent work. Keep up the good fight
THANK YOU!!!!
THANK YOU.
thank you senator. PLEASE keep this up
Thank you! Keep it up!
so proud! Thank you for standing strong and representing the American people.  Keep it up.
Great! Now stop Sessions!
Thank you, Senators #resist
Great job!!! We are behind you 100%!!! Hold the line! Give no quarter! 
OBSTRUCT IT ALL!!!
@SenJeffMerkley THANK YOU Senator! I'm SO Proud of my OR Senators!
thank you for this
Refuse it ALL - the USA as we know it is at stake #resist
Keep up the momentum and block Sessions and Devos! 
thank you.
This is a good start. Sessions must be stopped too. Need repubs to come to their senses.
@SenateDems @TheDemocrats This is a good start. Keep it up. #stopsessions too @JudiciaryDems . Devos as well.
Thank you!!  Stay strong.
thank you! Keep up the fight!
Thank you!
I believe it's your obligation to do whatever you can to slow the destruction of our democracy. It's that critical
YES! Boycott the vote!  More of this!  This is what we want to see. Oppose these sham cabinet nominees.
ridiculous, you should be thrown off the committee...
@gekkeijyu @SenateFinance yes. Thank you @SenateDems.
Sen. Wyden, huge thank you for this move. It is bold and right and it is the kind of leadership we need right now.
Thank you, @RonWyden !@SenateFinance
And that's great and all, but please convince Sen. Collins to change her vote on Sen. Sessions for AG.
@SenatorCollins is acting AGAINST HER BASE!
So, will you just leave them in limbo, or will you eventually vote NO???
they will vote NO and it won't matter,but they are doing whatever they can to obstruct,like we ask
SAD!
What a despicable act of obstruction by the Socialists Democrat party.
GREAT. KEEP IT UP.
Still can't reach your office by phone. Block Sessions!! (Portland resident) #NoOnSessions
democrats are a bunch of lying corrupt jerks. And YOU lost.
And, Hell No! on Sessions, and DeVos!! @SenJeffMerkley
why move forward with anyone?  Obstruct the fascist on everything
way to go! This ethical leadership gives others strength to do what's right.
in their own eyes-blinded by the lust 4 power n control. Stalin-like - or FDR - or Obama, right? #CCOT
please do the same for Sessions - in fact, block all remaining nominees. All pose the country a great threat if confirmed.
thank you, keep it up
Thank you, Ron! We're proud of you!
