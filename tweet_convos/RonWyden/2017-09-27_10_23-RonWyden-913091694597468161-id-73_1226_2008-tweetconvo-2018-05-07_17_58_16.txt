In June, Price took a Learjet 55 from DC to Nashville—a $17,760 roundtrip flight.

Commercial airline tix would have cost $102-$333/person. https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/912815493689544705 …
I bet if we match your so called official travel to NFL games and MLB games in different states that would be a great CNN or Fox News story
Their standard for "ethical" seems to be whatever is "legal." This is why they're so desperate for deregulation. Then anything is "ethical!"
I missed @GOP saying we can’t afford healthcare 4 people with disabilities. The lying tour continues for the Senior embarrassment from OR
Isn't that interesting?
Price is a liar, fraud & shyster; His "tell" is his repeated use of "the fact is" which immediately signals that everything he says is a lie
We are the highest tax country in the world why can't we afford health care
We are not, that's a right-wing talking point, not a fact.
Actually we can. And will someday.
Sen., would you direct staff to write a "Presidenting for Dummies"book & include ethics, appointing experienced cabinet, transparency, etc.?
As you sit in your residence in NY, how do you have any idea what the people of #Oregon want?
I'd like to remind everyone who has GOP representatives to call and tell them you want Medicare for all. Do NOT let the Dems silence you
Remember when Dems said you could keep your insurance? Keep your doctor? Save $2,500 a year? 
They lied!
Cannot afford  health insurance prems on top of non covered medical treatment, past out pocket medical bills pre deductibles with ACA now
So, if they have to take private jets because they are SOOOO busy, how come they can't get ANYTHING done?
@SecPriceMD is acting like the Democrat Rep Pelosi. Doesn't he know private air transportation is only 4 Democrats?
Remember @RonWyden  we can afford healthcare for EVERYBODY
But you're ok with what your state is doing to disabled? You do remember that you represent Oregon? https://www.facebook.com/oregonrepublicanparty/posts/10159456615305615 …
And #Pelosi flying across US on govt dime for personal business?  I missed that tweet from you Senator.
How much you sent flying back and forth to Oregon to speak to the liberal base would assume many times that
Say it with me #MedicareForAllNow
I read the bill, it didnt say that. Why lie?
You meant to say #MedicareForAll right Ron?
spending that kind of money  they sure in the hell don't need tax cuts got to pay for it some how
You must have forgotten about Loretta Lynch's private jet meeting with Bill Clinton to collude about the email thing.  Retire
And make him pay the difference, just like the OTHER federal employees would if they exceeded the travel allowance!
How many trip to and from DC have you taken?  And New York?
What the @GOP means is that there is no $$ for US.
There is no limit to the $$ Republicans will give themselves.
We can die, they don't care
And how much money did Oregon Waste on our failed Health Care website? That's right it was 300 million dollars.

Love you & have voted for forever but while these flights are a waste they really aren't comparable to health care. Get Real Senator.
I un-tweeted so I could keep retweeting this.
GOP affluenza
You mean #GOPclones like Idaho's @SenatorRisch @MikeCrapo @MikeSimpson4ID ?  That bold face lie when you talk 2 them about Medicare and ADA?
All elected officials should be howling about this!
I think he took 42 of those. Total 400.000$. Learned that from his boss
#GOPJesus is nothing if not hypocritically consistent. #TheGriftersKeepGrifting

Congress "should:" require all dept heads to fly coach on commercial flights. That would scare them sillier that they already are.
Go away Ron. Everyone in Oregon knows how corrupt you are. Nobody believes a word you tweet.
Hypocrites
@senrobportman @ChuckGrassley @BenSasse @RandPaul @JohnCornyn @BobCorker A lot of voters won't forget, and the machines won't be hacked.
To be fair, that's the cost of an average one-day ER visit (w/ tests), so he's not wasting all that much money. #sarcasm
Graft and corruption at it's very best. We know how to pick em, don't we.
When did they ever say that?
Hmmm! Never never 1 complaint about the worst president ever( nope not Jimmy Carter but Obama) 105 million of flights! Why not?
@kylegriffin1 Look senator you have failed to fix the failing ACA. We are not interested in the blame game. Get to work!
@kylegriffin1 & @realDonaldTrump are problems w/#RussianOps @jeffsessions #TomPrice & #StevenMnuchin kno he's n no position2FIRE'm
That 50 minute charter flight would have paid for a sick American's health care for an entire year under the ACA.
And liberals are the ones who are "entitled"
We should refuse the bills and send them to him....
Nice swamp @realDonaldTrump has built. #Impeach45
Sounds like an Americans yearly subscription into a Health Care Plan?
Right! The ACA that the left signed into law and then rammed it down our collective throats without reading it, now  blames the gop. Liar.
do you fly commercial(coach)when you travel at gov't expense?

#firetomprice #grifter
You need to talk to your Dem colleagues who are against M4A bc of cost yet voted to increase defense budget by $70b
From a guy I have personally sat next to on a cramped Horizon Air jump to SEA from PDX on his way to D.C. Thanx for representing our state!
So can you ask secretary Price we need that money back for Puerto Rico and can use the plane to
And if he were employed in private sector? Abuse of corporate expense account = termination for cause; end of career. #FirePrice
@TheDemocrats need to have a winning strategy to fight back & stop whining!
Wow a Lear 55, was there no King Air available to charter for that short flight?
Ron, what have you done to lower taxes on your Oregon Taxpayers? #LowerAllTaxes
This shit makes me ill
Wish they would say that & be honest, but they never are. They will lie & say people will be "better off because of more access".

#VoteBlue
I'm sure he took 52.3 others along for the ride.
Drag him Ron
Tom Price sees it as the reverse:  Every dollar spent on some person with disability issues is a dollar not available for Price's luxury.
Seared into our memory. The two are inextricably linked in our brains.
Beat this message like a drum, Ron!
