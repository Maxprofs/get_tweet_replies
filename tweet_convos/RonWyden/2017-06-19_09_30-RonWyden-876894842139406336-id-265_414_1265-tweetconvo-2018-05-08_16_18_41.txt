Republicans = scum of the earth. It's the end of their party.
Democrats are already gone.
Oh Steve. FAKE NEWS!! 
Nothing fake about lazy Democrats doing nothing. Even when they're in the room they have nothing to add to progress.
 wow. Spoken like a true child.
Yes, children speak truth even when clueless adults like you don't like what they say. Lmao! Give me some more, I love to laugh
The problem: a toddler is RUINING OUR COUNTRY. That - is NOT a laughing matter. I am saddened you think it is!
The problem: you libtards don't like that our country's on it's way back to freedom & liberty again. Watching you whine is a laughing matter
They did the same thing themselves with Obamacare and it cost America a trillion dollars. Democrats need to be in internment camps!
Bulllllllshit. They were simply unWILLING to contribute. Big difference. It can't be all or nothing.
 wow. How sadly childish you are. Oh poor you..blinded by a toddler and his scare tactics
Hahahaha!  You're such a fool. You totally have me roflmfao. Thank you
Laugh all you want. It's the world that is laughing at us now....
No, the world is laughing at you.  They are regaining respect for our country's leader after Obama took us down.
They all need to be working together not doing anything behind the others' backs
The Democrats have to show up for work to get that going on. And we all know Democrats are allergic to work. So, there you go
Said the real estate guy that most likely sold property to democrats everyday....yet he seemed to care so little about his commissions.
I'm in business to help people, all people. Political preferences aren't material & rarely a topic of discussion. Everybody is equal with me
So it's okay to tweet negative things that further divide our country but you would never actually say it to their face....
I'm not tweeting anything negative. You find it negative because you don't agree. But that's how liberals think with your double standards
Somehow that statement seems negative ....
No, that was a positive statement. Stating facts & observations.
@FoxNews @CNNPolitics @SenSchumer REASON for "closed door" to get SOMETHING DONE. Isn't this how You @NancyPelosi #Reid PASSED #ACA.
Uh, no. There were multiple hearings, bipartisan agreements, negotiations.... longest debate on a bill in history. Stop lying
You are obviously talking about the Democrats, Right?
Obviously humans are flawed and cannot foresee each domino in the chain. But the legislation of the ACA actually was designed to help ppl
Government's job is protection: military, Legislate, Judicial Congress is "not qualified" to control a massive health organization.
Well, you're wrong. Models are working around the world.. effective, healthy and happy peoples. Folks getting care
SMALL countries w/ Socialize Healthcare? The United States consists of "50" States with National DEBT 19.9 Trillions.http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
We really need term limits for both Senators and Congressional Reps.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews Remember the ACA and Nancy Pelosi stating, "You have to sign it to see what's in it."? NO?
The Democratic Party should now be declared a terrorist organization.
Republicans believe in sanctity of life unlike democrats baby killers
So good to see the Republicans working with the Dems. But they're right, it's the Dems who are 'obstructionists'...
exactly!
Good! That AHCA needs to be stalled and NEVER replace the ACA! Americans will be Thankful in the long run.
We are already thankful Obama & Democrats are out so we can fix the mess they made. Get government out of our lives & healthcare
WE ARE THE GOVERNMENT! You think Obama and the (D)'s made a mess, continue to watch the disaster the (R)'s are making. AHCA=No Healthcare!
@RealEstate4SoMD @CLAUDIOKLLAMAS1 @CNN You are wrong. Your picture suggests your Senior, probably with pre-existing conditions. No INS 4 U.
I am senior but likely healthier than you. Let me worry about my insurance, you worry about yours. Get government out!
No! I'm not going to let people like you decide to take away my healthcare. So like it or not Medicare&Caid will remain, Universal is next!
Universal is Obamacare & that's a disaster. Healthcare was better & insurance more affordable before the government got involved
gee, isn't that what Dems did to Repubs 8yrs ago, thought so!
You mean that's what Republicans did the 8 years of President Obama
Actually it wasn't what they did.  Spent over a month debating it and 166 republican changes to it ...
Actually you don't know what your talking about, Nice Try!
25 days of debate spanning over two months and actually 161 republican amendments .... so ummmmm..... yeah I do.
(We have to pass the bill to find out what's in it) Wise Up!
If they're in the senate they didn't lose.
Their party lost. All the "signs" pointed to a Dem's winning and controlling everything and didn't happen. Let POTUS get the agenda in!
Why does it seem Democrats have all the power? Basically doing and saying anything they want, where are the Republicans?
Crafting a healthcare bill in secret.
So what it still needs to get voted on, they can bitch then
Didn't the Dems pass ACA in the middle of the night and tell us we can read it when it's out?
Then again my friend she does talk coo coo so we have 2 read between her rants. But 2 me she said "you'll C it when we want you 2! Pres Bush
#Obamacaresucks #Obamacaresucks #Obamacaresucks #Obamacaresucks #Obamacaresucks #Obamacaresucks #Obamacaresucks #Pelosimyballz #DumDumDems
Just do it
How's that feel now Chuckie
Grow up
You're turn......How's it feel when on the other side of the door
Why don't Dems protest slaughtering of blacks in Chicago? They created the mess,with Dem Mayor who is blind to it.
Scary to think PPL actually picked this clown @SenSchumer to be their voice. His #faketears were for outsiders not his constituents. SMH
Trump RULES!! Congress has No Power's
Best decision ever! Let everything stay stand-still & maintain the status-quo till the GOP, @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan see their stupidity
I thought Obamacare was a dead duck.  Quack.  Lol
Awww, are the Republicans being mean to the poor, outnumbered Democrats - again?
Gee. What happened to the we are all one speech after Republican senators were shot? Typical 2 face BS!
Schumer is an awful, awful human being.
# of ACA Insurers 2017
# of #ACA Insurers 2014...
Funny with Obamacare "it had to be passed to find out what was in it" then Obama LIED TO ALL OF US. @POTUS God Speed & save us all.
My question is why have they waited so long?
Haha
We are backing you, hang in there...and Fight this Corruption
This guy is a friggin jerk, plain and simple
TO HALT BUSINESS,,,,, YOU SOB'S ONLY SIT ON YOUR HANDS ANYMORE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dems don't work anyway. They just slander their Pres.& work mainstreaming violence against folks who disagree with them. Bad,DiabolicalStuff
Question is, can GOP pull a nuclear vote and over ride DEM'S again?
Awe you poor snowflakes with no power bite me
We would but since basic immunizations are about to be lost for 1/3 of children in the US  and rabies would be catastrophic... no thanks!
Blahdy blah blah blah. #termlimits
Something NEEDS to be done to make this process transparent because it's not their insurance their deciding about, it's ours. Need to know.
Thank you @SenSchumer! Breast cancer pts like me need the #ACA 
They dont like that the republicans are using the same tactics democrats used? Shocking
Can't wait until #2018MidTerms to slap these jackasses around - Do It Now!!!
Chuckypoo (.@SenSchumer) maybe they should pass it to see what's in it (.@NancyPelosi) oh wait that line of BS was already used.
Just following the Dems example on the ACA.  Hypocrite.
False outrage
Democrats want to halt America 
 They want a swamp country and  call it a the United Banana State of Swamp??Fake news will remain as is.
@SenateDems Go people Obstruct Trumpcare! #Resistance 
Wait a second. Right after the Alexandria shootings didn't Schumer say that the Dems & GOP are capable of working together?
Send a message to Pelosi that it must pass before anybody sees it.  Isn't that what she said about Obamacare?
Actually it wasn't.  166 changes made by republicans done before it passed.
He's such an a-hole.  Get to work you whiner
Go dems fight abuse of power and legislative trickery
GOP determined to screw the little.guy as always
Why oh why doesn't little guy get it?
Good news. Not good that our politics is so partisan, but the dems can’t pretend it isn’t happening and not respond in kind.
Go for it.
@TopherSpiro I support you this and calling today to let u know!!! When great injustice shine light on it #ahca #speakup #shame
It's time for both parties to put the adult pants on and work together.  Our taxes are paying for them to work not throw tantrums.
Shut it down!  Don't give those seditious gangsters any slack.
Need some Republicans with guts to join in!!!!!
Maybe media and Dems forgot how Harry Reid shut out the Republicans
Does the media condone such behavior or are hey that biased to the left
Disgraceful
BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO FROG-EYES>>DISAPPEAR?
Go Democrats!!! Thank you for fighting for 23 million Americans' health care!! God speed.
They are doing nothing but wasting our taxpayers money .Yeah, thanks Democrats.
Good. It's about time they stopped rolling over.
.@CNN please keep the coverage coming. 10s of millions r depending on the beleaguered media to get them the info they need. #ProtectOurCare
This way I can have health care coverage and I won't have to get a job. I'll let the taxpayers pay for it. Thanks Obama.
Want to bet that Ds allow unanimous consent for recessing most of summer? No budget, no debt limit relief...
@RonWyden @SenSchumer Fight, Chuck, Fight.  Atta boy, Chuck!
Good! Shut it all down
The Dems haven't been doing any business since they lost the election who are you kidding
Good
#ShowUsTheBill
Good!!
heeeeeeell yeah
Is this what their supporters voted for very sad. Just going to obstruct our potus at every turn.
Obstruct potus till we impeach potus 
He is going DOWN DOWN DOWN
It's actually about transparency and protecting the healthcare of people... asking for transparency is the opposite of obstruction
So they're (democrats) saying: let everyone suffer greatly because we aren't gunna try to fix anything. Acting like spoiled brats.
This man has got to be the most disgusting individual on earth.
Democrats have always passed laws to fix laws they screwed up in the first place, usually making it even worse. I consider them lowlife.
Democrats need a cry space with pillows to scream into.
Awesome! Without Democrats then America will be even greater again!
Stop funding Obamacare now!
I remember the Dems behind LOCKED doors when the passed Obama care. They would not even let republicans in the room. These people are nuts.
Please stop crying and complaining you Dems! Enough is enough get to fff work!
Democrats have been working? On WHAT?!? It sounds like @SenSchumer is coming up with an excuse to sit on his ass for ANOTHER next 6 months
Like the closed door process used to create Obamacare?
You need to pass it to find out what's in it.
Democrats 
Come on children you need to work together thats why your there! WE NEED TERM LIMITS!
Yayyyyy
.......steam coming from ears.. ...Get back to work!
Democrats costing tax payers more money staying out of senate to protest never have and senate members ever protested till now disgusting!!
Children throwing a tantrum
Nothing has changed
So what's new! The dems haven't done any business since Trump has been in office. All they do is obstruct!
Exactly how? The republicans meet without them and yet the dems are obstructing? How?
I am sure the republicans has done the same under Obama and will do it again if the president is a democrat. USA is killed by its people.
Dumb move Chuck
Obstructionist ironic these damn is bitch and moan about not being included when they did the same thing with the ACA
Don't you dare to come with paper tiger stuff!
they hate everything to do with the right
Democrats have no power to do anything. Drain the swamp
They did the same thing with Obama Care behind closed doors under cover of darkness.
What the heck, the Dems just want to sit on their behinds until time to go home . If they had a real job they would be fired
Because they want to see the healthcare bill before its voted on ?
You mean like the dems did with Obama care??
why so dem can leak and say bull crap lies .  their globalist and want the usa to fail . to bring in one world order
Pelosi & Reid locked doors & refused any GOP opinions on ACA.  Obama ran around country promoting lies on keeping doctor, plan & saving $$
Kick evil clown & his side kick Pelosi out They're nothing but self serving, corrupt, lying, devious people Halt senate business & duty?
The Democrats are welcome to join in the debates but they refuse.
what business other than tv interviews
Deal with second class losers.
Once again #Democrats #Obstructionist #Hypocrites #AmericansFirst #MERICA #MAGA
Hard for the democrats to obstruct if the republicans have the majority....
Dems didn't include Repubs  when crafting ACA.  Now, they're protesting the  closed door process? They slammed the door in their own faces.
bWaahahahahaaa! 
Islamocrats Need To S T F U-
“Do As I Say, Not As I Do”
The time has come for #Resist supporters of the whole country to show the GOP that they cannot highjack peoples healthcare.
About Fu*king time you guys grew some balls
Senate business is an oxymoron isn't it  ?
What exactly have they been doing?Damn Dims can't remember what they did yesterday.Owl poop is smarter than the Dims.Cant cure stupid
What business are they doing? All I see are investigations and media talking points. Should be no results no pay both sides.
Russia
Please grow up and actually act like adults- both sides. Quit taking your toys and going home....
Funny!!  That's how the democrats got it passed behind closed doors
HALT, what do you mean!!!  The Democrats HAVEN'T done anything constructive in nearly 10 years.  They are laughable.
Good, lock the doors and Keep them out.
Good, finally the Dems are fighting back. The GOP can go kiss my Ass
What a bunch of morans
Democrats will never get over the election loss. We might have to keep winning to teach them a lesson #MAGA
How is taking healthcare away from sick children winning?
Oh please,  don't give me your CNN narrative
I think you meant CBO narrative 
No I meant CNN
Pretty sure you meant CBO
Nope
Democrats have still not learned their lesson..have they now ?
HALT Senate Business??? Tell us: WHAT else has lil' chuckie been doing since November??? They'll pay a dear & costly price for it next year.
Congress has to have term limits or this country is going to FAIL this democratic experiment VERY BIGLY bc of the greed in everyone in power
shummer shut up.
GOOD

Today the WH is holding an off camera and no recording daily press briefing? The president should learn the old Russian term perestroika!
Glasnost
Obamacare has already gutted itself!
term limits needed..these assholes are getting paid by taxpayers to do a job and not act like 5 yr old children..a waste of taxpayer money
Still crying what a bunch of losers
Why let Dems criticize parts of a package before the package is finalized?
Why is it when GOP uses the same tactics as Dems passing Obama care it's an outrage?
None...investigate trying to find a morcel of Russia/Trump collusion what a waste
Democrats need 2 B voted out of office 4  trying to support the legacy of a flawed terrorist supporting potus (O'enema) 4 no rational reason

The Democrats don't do a damn thing anyways so it's going to be business as usual we won't notice a thing
As opposed to democrats closed door Trump Russia narrative delay tactics?  Another useless socialist revolt.
Resist. Insist. Persist.
Dems r inept. They r being handed a chance to win one or both and especially the WH back BUT theyre ineffective
If you won't work with the man in charge, get out.
No brains from CNN
WTF that will show them, just what the hell have you guys been doing for the last several months other then your witch hunt get to work
Can we have a Day Without A Democrat? Then a week. Followed by a month. Know what we'd miss? Not one thing. #maga
Good. Passing something that affects 1/6 of the economy with no hearings and no debate should not happen.
You lost get over it.
Obstructionists
Obstructionism is not going to get you more votes The voters will remember your lack of real work in 2018 Reps Super Majority
So how about if CNN explains how this is obstruction

Who'll notice?
Exactly...they haven't done anything so far except scream Russia..Russia..Russia now maybe we will quit hearing that 
Do you think the lack of bi-partisan involvement in Obamacare passing back when has anything to do with this behavior now ?
Schumer 
Well, yeah, but who listens to Schumer anyway. I always spell his name wrong.
The democrats have now turned into a political terrorist organization.
No. No, they haven't
Oh, definitely! Because peaceful protest is anathema to principles of democracy oh wait...
Now we get to see the real "Party of NO" at work in their attempt to sacrifice the health of millions of Americans to show their "HATE"
ALL THIS OBSTRUCTION IS NOTHING MORE THAN "HATE" of America that Democrats feel and exhibit. They claim ballfield shooting as a Dem victory
Seems like inside baseball to halt the government over.  Why not wait until we see what they come up with as that may present a real issue.
Bc mcconnell won't let anyone read it & wants it 2 b voted on w/no debate r public hearings r cbo analysis.& no,ACA was Not passed same way.
ok...they seal their own fate that way.  They can't come up with a bill that gets all R Senators support.
These entitled schmucks are wearing on my last nerve. Term limits is the only solution . Job performance based earnings would be nice.
