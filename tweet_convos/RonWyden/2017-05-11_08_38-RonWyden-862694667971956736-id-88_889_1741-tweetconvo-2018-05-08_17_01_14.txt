He didn't fucking answer the question!
Thanks for your great questioning to #McCabe and standing up for democracy! #followthemoney
You mean he won't update him, the White House, unpack that don't exist? That's fucking perfect
What about updating sessions? He's supposed to be recused!
Dam McCabe it was a simple question a yes or no regarding regulations.
@RonWyden I understood & I will answer yes it would have been wrong!
I have a bridge to sell too.....
Thank you for all you do and keeping them honest

mc cabe needs to be fired next.~tik
He was asking a policy question if it is wrong but something like that to be asked. I don't like that he didn't answer
#Trumpstooge
I don't know if I believe that! Trump has way too many puppets in Washington.
I know. It seems like everyone is compromised.
Sounds like the right guy, hope he means it & he gets somewhere quick with this investigation...Trump worked my last nerve back in February.
He's the 1 went to WH after NYT story (on 2/14/17 saying Trump campaign team had repeated contacts w/Russians) & said it was BS (altho true)
So....shady Fukker, huh?
Not sure. Comey may have kept him out of loop. He says he doesn't need more resources for #TrumpRussia & not aware Comey asked for more
And we believe him because.....
More for Don the Con. Good job Kyle.
After Wyden acted like a disrespectful dbag to everyone in the FBI he questioned today...
Or the American public for that matter.
McCabe and I are planning to survive this.
I actually like my ADHD
Thank you Senator. Please keep the pressure high
Yeah right!
just watched  the question period  with FBI well  done Senator Wyden @RonWyden
Sen. Wyden was extraordinary today. Thank you sir for representing so many of us citizens who are horrified w #TrumpRussia. You do OR proud!
U believe him? Shuld we ? Idk
Who ever lets this loser stay as Atty. .Gen. long enough to get his name on the door should be fired. Wyden is one of the trouble makers.
No he will leak updates to CNN lmao
Easy for him to say, he'll probably be out of the job by tomorrow
McCabe wouldn't answer a yes or no question... I don't trust him either
Senator Wyden. Thank U 4 your direct ?'s today. U R my new 'man/brainiac'  crush.  That's a high honor. Judge R Posner is the other. 
But hasn't McCabe already assured Trump admin. to consult with them prior to Senate Testimony? Do I have that right?
@AltUSFWS @MSNBC Has he gotten his pink slip yet? #Fired #TrumpRussia #IndependentInvestigation
Do we believe that

Yes!!! Finally someone with some sense! There is hope!!!
All this political grandstanding and still I've seen no evidence of Russia interference/collusion. Stop wasting time & $$$ and get to work.
Thank you Senator @RonWyden !
@RonWyden @MSNBC  go get 'em Ron!!!
He seems a bit shaky 2 me; I dnt think he will be able 2 resist pressure from Trump. Additionally, Trump's staff said he wd be visiting FBI
DEMOCRATS WILL SELF DESTRUCT !

Our President Trump and  V.P. Pence
#draintheswamp 
#mega
McCabe too "cagey" in his answers & has already gone to WH to inform & impede news that was later confirmed as correct --Can't trust him.
Thank you for asking the important questions!
We will see!! He is the one that had the meeting with Rance Previos about the nine story from the New York Times!!!!!
U need to watch him very closely sneaky
If You need to know about E-MAIL SERVER'S' Phone's !! Ask HILLARY CLINTON' !! SHE SHOULD BE IN JAIL
Breached Privacy !!
@RonWyden
Of course he won't. Andrew McCabe will no longer be employed at the FBI by next week. Good riddance. @kylegriffin1 @mikiebarb @MSNBC
Calm down Ron!
Omg Wyden's voice like needles on a chalk board!!!
Fire him too!
Ron continues to make fool of himself pursuing his False narrative on Trump Russia Fake collusion. Very funny to watch, real soap opera.
Suffering succatash Ron Wyden is a huge political hack
Ron Wyden: sufferin succotash
He went to WH earlier re news re collusion & tried to delegit news via Congress for WH -- HAS CONGRESS FORGOTTEN!? Can't trust him.
Can we please consider reneging on this promise as treason? At least tentatively.
Ron Wyden is Sylvester the Cat
closet thing we're going to get to an 'independent' investigation??  I'm holding out hope that McCabe will wrap this up quickly
Pompeo needs to be charged with contempt.
Absolutely. That guy was a total dick.
THEY HAVENT BEEN UPDATING THE WHITEHOUSE AT ALL!SO WHATS THE NEWS?
I will believe it when I see it, so many lies and deceptions....hope this guys on the up and up...
Thank you Ron Wyden! Turn up the heat
it led to trannies Burr & Nunes to become Drumpf PR flaks.
Good on Wyden. Oregon pride!
Ask McCabe about his Priebus convo of 2/15  ‘I want you to know story in NYT is BS"
@B636... is a bot. 14 followers and profile says he has something to do with government agencies.  Block him.
Gauntlet, thrown.
@RonWyden @MSNBC if you lit a match in the current room @realDonaldTrump is in, it would explode.
You're a liar Wyden. Trump never encouraged Russia to hack. Can't hack a destroyed server. Issue was Clinton subjected herself to hacking.
Is this one of those "alternative facts" we've heard so much about?
suspect #terrorist in USA maybe #ISIS #Robert #Marcone  https://usaagainstisis.blogspot.com 
.What do you think of that @realDonaldTrump? This is a big FU to you. #TrumpRussiaInvestigation #TrumpRussiaCoverUp
Like being put in front of a firing squad and being asked if you're going to blink.  Good for him.
Incoming tweetstorm from @realDonaldTrump  tomorrow morning...
Sooooo, this guys gonna get fired too?
If he gets fired I'm pretty sure all hell will break loose.
doesn't matter. he'll be replaced soon
GOOD MAN
