#Mnuchin is a bad pick! Still in bed with the wrong people
All of you democrats need several valium, or how about a lobotomy.
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance 6.The public has been screwed in so many ways and the Congress knows that 90%don't watch nor care.
TY 4 always thinking of the people of OR and this nation, sir. 
You're a gr8 politician & even better human being.
Denial lives
Are you going to try blaming him for your mistakes? If it is not illegal it is your way of doing business.
people like you, are why people like me switched parties.   Quit over talking people!  Listen and learn.
Wyden criticizes others ethics yet supports President Obama- who pardons military spies & domestic terrorists- + spits on Israel
Distorted Thinking
I consider Ron illegitimate-he LIVES in New York while maintaining senate seat in Oregon-anyone see a conflict?
@TakeOurMedia @RonWyden @SenateFinance Trying to "Bork" nominees.  Shameful tactics.
.@DarlstephL Exactly. Wyden's "Borking" rings hallow. Just like his mentor, Tub Kennedy.

 @stand4honor @RonWyden @SenateFinance
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance 4.There are some senators on the Dem side.Warren,Kaine,Menendez,Franken,Murphy etc. who truly stand up
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance 3.that government is not by the people and for the people.Ot is,solely about POWER.NOTHING MORE.
UR an embarrassment to the U.S.Senate and all of your constituents...except maybe those POTHEADS who care only about their next PUFF!
Could DJT be #JFK, #RFK, #JFKjr , MLK revenge. Prayin.
You resemble grandpa in The Munsters 

I don't like you
I'm on the opposite side of the political spectrum from you. However, I appreciate your tenacity in vetting process
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance 5.That tRump will not be held accountable is an UNDERSTATEMENT.He will take his POWER OF GLOOM to DC.
Keep up your great work.
Mnuchin is unethical and should not be approved to lead Treasury. He can't be trusted!!!
Mr Mnuchin is chewing up members time with BS without answering question. Evil tactic.
Partisan Ron is OFF HIS MEDs embarrasses himself @ Mnuchin Hearing  Colleague has to offers Ron  some Valium!
UR arrogance, disrespect, asking ?'s requiring VERY detailed answers within a limited time then criticism for non-detailed reply is comical!
pay attention to the gothca crap from Wyden this guy needs to be fired Oregonians rise up and TRUMP on!
you better vote no on Mnunchin!
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance 2.republicans senators offer effusive praise for nominees that clearly are not qualified to run a dept.
eat an azzzzz
did you take that Valium?
: did @PatRoberts just promote Valium? Check his stock buys. I'm sure he's profiting off position like @RepTomPrice.
Thank you for being pointed, aggressive, Senator. No need to roll over for Trump's sure to be confirmed goons and plenty concerns
Thank you, Senator Wyden, for asking the tough questions.
Mnuchin keeps saying "certain" nonprofit. Does he mean private nonprofits, wealthy families set-up? Ask what type?
Sour Grape Questions!
You sir are a guy that epitmizes the frustration of Americans in our government, you're fired get out of DC
Hatch is countering to crap Wyden is spewing, the very type of non productivity fron senators in the last decade
release fannie mae & freddie mac. Reward shareholders who took the risk & now watch the profits get taken.
Where can we see your tax returns?
grateful to you Senator Wyden. Can't believe how crass @SenPatRoberts was. Embarrassing.
Why don't you let him answer the questions? I would love to see you grilled that way. You're an empty suit.
You acted like a "mean girl". A real man can ask tough questions w/o being uncivil.
what a crock asking policy questions that does not set them is just stupid and the reason voters are pissed
Take the #Valium
Why do you ask questions to which you ignore and fail to comprehend the answers from our next Treasury Secretary?
You can ask your questions without your snarky tone and demeaning remarks. You present yourself poorly.
You're an embarrassment to the state of Oregon by your rude behavior and grandstanding today!
Get over it!
.@realDonaldTrump Is our POTUS
.@RonWyden @SenateFinance please fix your lisp.
Ron Wyden is the definition of what is wrong with country! Stop focusing on being an arrogant a$$hole & do ur job!
Come out of the closet Ron. You major dork
you have not asked a specific question and your rude! Hope your up for reelection in two years
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance tell Senator Roberts the transfer of a controlled substance is a Feseral offense
.@RonWyden .@SenateFinance Morally/ethically unfit. Insist that doing the rt thing isn't a financial cost/benefit analysis-->peoples' lives
get em Wyden! Take some adderall instead and Sic em!!!!!!
#Mnuchin THANK YOU, Sen Wyden !!
It's beyond Democratic anger. That's over. It's about QUALIFIED cabinet! Rushing thru UNPRECEDENTED Noms is NOTOK!
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance #Mnuchin #MakeAmericaSickAgain #CabinetBlock #rejecttrumpcabinet #RiggedCabinet #RejectPruitt
guess you can twist anything to make it sound bad. @RonWyden
"turning out #foreclosures like @realdonaldtrump turns out ties" #mnuchinhearing #2008financialcrisis #StillWithHer
this idiot just blamed everything he possibly could on Steve Mnuchin
Ron Wyden screams & criticizes millionaires - what a hypocrite, he & his wife get millions from shady NY groups!
how much shit did I make up. Amazing that you @RonWyden can get away with saying so many false statements. Crazy
These are amazing times!
truly have lost faith in career politicians @RonWyden
the closing of Sears stores has to do with Mnunchin. Hahaha wow that is a stretch. Please wrap up @RonWyden
Obama enabled and encouraged roughly 9 million foreclosures. This was Geithner’s explicit policy at Treasury.
propaganda at its finest!
Wow, You're Absolutely Disgusting.. You Target Needed Tax Change and Label it a Scam.

@TheDemocrats Have NO Solutions, Just Blame
amazing to see such a high ranking person be so wrong and sit on an iron throne spewing untrue facts. Straight joke
you read your prewritten speech like it's the 3 little bears.
BRAVO FOR @RonWyden OPENING STATEMENT @REALDONALDTRUMP 0 TAXES PAID FOR 30+YRS OUR #PEOTUS @SenateFinance #MnuchinHEARING #notmypresident
nice opening statement. Thank you
@SenSchumer @SenateFinance He's a good man

Did Mnuchin forget to list the tax haven he directed in the Cayman Islands or was he trying to hide his tax dodging from the committee? https://twitter.com/jonathanweisman/status/822038790957047809 …
thanks for standing up for the middle class, senator.
Stress-test the hell out of him, Sen. Need competence, non-corruption to prevent next crisis. Mnuchin = "Brownie"
