Small reminder: @NationalADAPT doesn't fuck around https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2017/6/22/15855424/disability-protest-medicaid-mcconnell …

On scene today:
The scene: Lots of wheelchairs. Dozens of oxygen masks. Nurses & union reps. Doctors in white lab coats. Tons of police. Connects 2 bldgs
They should be careful the GOP may turn their protest into a disrespect to the flag and anthem  a page from Trump playbook
They gonna knock em outta their chairs and haul them off again?
I would not be surprised. I hope someone is ready to film it...
They are
Yeah, I've been seeing that.
Disturbing....
Soroooooooos!
Bot
Not
"shit don't start poppin till after 2pm"
Are they going to yank them out of their chairs like they have previously?
#CrookedDonald
Heroes  every last one of them.


KEEP STRONG THROW THE CORRUPT  SON OF BITCHES GOP OUT ON THEIR ASSES !
This is America at its best.
You must of used a lot of busses to bring in your welfare and Medicaid users
God bless them all, keep up the good fight #Resistance #Resist45 #HealthCareDebate #HCHumanRights
The “hearing” is a sham.  A complete perversion of the legislative process.
Disabled Americans out here representing..WHOOP WHOOP!!
The first of our rights guaranteed to us by the declaration of independence.
You could've told me it was also a line for walmart.
I so appreciate their willingness to be there to represent the millions of Americans who oppose this bill.  Thank you!
How many are paid by lobbyists to be there?
Not one single ADAPT member is paid to lobby. we fight for our own lives. we are way beyond the  lobby.
What a beautiful thing- you truly make my heart glad and hopeful! Thank you for being there! #KillTheBill #resist
All Rep Sens & Trump that support G-C should be ashamed! Donor first not constituents!  Our memories are long! #votethemout
#GrahamCassidy is a smoke & mirrors bill intended to fool the American people into thinking all will B covered. Shame on U @LindseyGrahamSC
Good for them..  repeal it!
Thanks to every last one of you for standing for what's right!
Fire Hazards!!
Thank you heros!!
Don't you just love Americans' never say die fighting spirit? #GivingItAllTheyGot
@lsarsour -Lobying for their free stuff
And in your opinion 250 people matter more than 380 million.
Please express the gratitude of many if us who wish we could be there.
THANK YOU THE WORLD IS BEHIND YOU.
GRAHAM CRACKER , AND McConnell, & RYAN MUST BE IN THE SWAMP!!
DRAIN THE SWAMP IMMEDIATELY AND SAVE AMERICA FROM DISGRACE!
YEAAAAA I'M WITH THEM IN SPIRIT
Which means McConnell & GOP leadership will probably switch rooms. Just like their fake "townhalls" they had (NOT)
Where the fuck is POTUS?
AMERICA WILL NEVER BE GREAT WITHOUT HEALTH CARE INSURANCE.
I DON'T CARE WHAT HUMPTY TRUMPTY SAYS!
JEFF CALL THAT GRAHAM CRACKER OUTSIDE OF THE HEARING AND STEP ON HIM TURN HIM INTO THE CRUMB THAT HE IS!
Why should congressmen & senators have better healthcare than the constituents they are suppose to serve? Have you ever ask that question?
Great Move Jeff Stein! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!
With you all in spirit.
Repeal & Replace GOP
What courage and heroism look like. They face incredible challenges and fight for us all. #ADAPTandRESIST
We are way passed 200 now.

#GrahamCassidy #ObamaCare
Americans are having to fight for the right for their own life

Spread the word. Anyone who can show up- please do. If you can give a ride to someone- please do!
These are the real heroes #Resist #KillTheBill

Wouldn't their message B more effective 2 show up at corporate headquarters & go door to door in wealthy neighborhoods demanding "PAY4ME!"?
Bless you wonderful people

Fighting for all of us. If you possibly can, be there!
Thank You from America 
Good start. Have many more people shown up since you posted this?
#FloodTheHalls #GrahamCassidy

It is time for the Capitol Hill Police to take a good look in the mirror.
Thanks for your superlative work covering the activism earlier in the summer, and continuation now.
One of them gives the power salute. Right on, lady!
Stop these people by any means necessary.
Sadly, you can't appeal to any sense of common decency or respect for ALL w/GOP. They are so evil they are incapable of empathy/ feeling
Please tell them they have our support 100%!! 

We need for folks to make calls today...especially to Collins, Murkowski, Capito & Portman.  Here are the numbers.  Please RT.
Only call your own Congresscritters.

But you can use @IndivisibleTeam's TrumpcareTen toolkit to phone bank to people in red states.
So all those people are on the dole?
As a healthcare professional, I need to know food and water are accessible for these awesome Americans??
YES! Thank you to these activists for being there for those of us that cannot.
This is democracy.
Doing the Lord's work
Stay strong. Hope those evil GOP reps have s that have compassion.
Sorry concerned citizens, those seats are reserved for lobbyists with a checkbook in their pocket.
And I bet none of them actually read the bill. Ignorance is so traitorous.
Thank ADAP and protesters. True heros!
@NationalADAPT we love you and we're with you!!
CLICK IMAGE TO ENLARGE......
These folks are amazing!
CLICK IMAGE TO ENLARGE......
These are American patriots
Such warriors! Tell them thank you all for fighting 
GOD BLESS ALL YOU HEROES FOR FIGHTING FOR ALL OF US! #SaveACA
"These folks don't even stand for the national anthem. Not real Americans!"
- Donald Trump
Putin's Puppet should not be potus
Thank you all! Go and get them!
