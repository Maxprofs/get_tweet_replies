Tomorrow, I will keep my commitment to vote to move beyond the failures of #Obamacare. I will vote yes on the motion to proceed.
Prove our commitment to not throwing 22 million Americans to the wolves on health care. #KillTheBill
When you voted yes on the #ACA you killed more Americans than Hitler
The aca kept more people healthy what are you talking about dude? Blame your insurance companies that don't care if you die
50% of Nevada Medicaid card holders can not get a doctor to see them. Insurance with no care. @ACA has failed.
We did our part.
@RonWyden please don't let them take away our ACA in Oregon. We don't deserve that.
I have faith in my elected leaders (@RonWyden) but who else should I call?
Never put your faith in a flawed human being
.@RonWyden - Consider filing endless amendments to delay vote. Consider filing amendment to drop ACA-style insurance for Congress & all govt
@SenateMajLdr is, literally the worst person on the planet. Not sure if he's really a person or just a festering pile of cowshit. #kygofig
O'Connell you need to know not all Smericans shrrr with your agenda
Somebody pls stop these madmen.. there must be so much money on it to sell out your country
And vote @SenateMajLdr out of office.
We have to get to all those ppl in backwoods who only listened to Fox explain what McConnell is doing to our&their country
They simply won't understand. DJT promised no cuts to what THEY need. #iamapreexistingcondition #MedicareForAll
@SenateMajLdr  @potus  Obamacare has not failed!  You and Trump are sabotaging Obamacare for a taxcut for the 1-2% wealthy in USA.
@SenateMajLdr  No tax cuts for billionaires on the backs of grandmas thrown out of nursing homes or poor kids suffering.
Keep fighting but Dems need a leader to run in 2020!
@SenateMajLdr YOU are the failure. Resign. You are Corrupt McConnell!
Here's a list to call:
Thx @johnjam101. Have just texted these 18.
Yes is what we in #Oregon demand you to vote. To move the Failed #ACA on to the trash heap of history.
Can you tweet out phone numbers?
Didn’t work folks
Despicable GOP!
I sure wish my target Senator were somebody other than Toomey.  I don't think he's reachable.
#45 = AmericanANGST @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenJohnMcCain @senrobportman  @cnn @SenDeanHeller @nytimes @weareoversight
McConnell is a trump flunky. Money over people's life.
No vote no
Why must we get lesser health care then what the congress and the president get? You get better regardless of the vote, not fair.
You caused obama care. You did not read it like any smart person would. You passed it. This is all on democrats
MITCH McCONNELL is a Bold Faces FREAKING OUT LIAR!
His GREED comes into Play too!
& Who knows his secrets causing him such FEAR?
Thank you Senator. Also, thank your staff for all the calls they graciously field. Your office is the best!
The #ACA has made my life comfortable instead of brutal just cuz of $! I shouldn't have to live out my days suffering #FixACA! 
The #ACA needs fixin not repeal! #WorkTogether! @SenMajLdr! This is #wrong4America! #FixACA! 
YOU'RE the only failure I see, mitchy

Must stop them! I hope today is "it". GOP extremists openly threaten they'll keep it up until they get "their" way.
Is it true, Senator Wyden, that total repeal is on the table to get Rand Paul's vote?
#IndependentCouncil!!
Be proactive Senator Wyden and ask for Mueller to become an "independent special prosecutor.
Made this spreadsheet w/ local office #s of house/senate to use if D.C. voicemail or lines are busy. CALL LOCAL!!!
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aNTEvz2N5il81uN5O18zEkvYVWAo9O-ObSS6akdBRuI/pubhtml# …
I support your efforts to block TrumpCare! Please stand against his tyranny over those with limited money or limited health or both!
"Leader" McConnell?!? Lol he's going to lead the #GOP into the biggest losses in history.  Mark my words, Republicans.
What is it your voting for?
Stop! Think!  Repeal causes economic disaster.  Hospitals close, Healthcare workers no jobs, many unemployed due to illness,  retail fails.
Called and thanked @SenBillNelson for his No and asked @marcorubio for a No, not that I expect him to listen.
This Man, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, has held over "*870*" TOWN HALLS! (Eight Hundred Seventy). THAT Tells YOU He Ain't Republican. #cNn #mSnBc
While secretly plotting?  Good for American people, the okey doke in full force!!!
Just called!
Vote no on motion to proceed. Millions more uninsured. It's a moral issue. Who are you representing?
Ever making the Target on his back bigger his job is over if he votes yes which I know he will
To @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan understand that if you drop millions from their health ins, YOU'LL OWN THIS #GENOCIDE. U can't blame @POTUS44.
Thank you for your efforts to stop this damage to us.
Fix the ACA!  VOTE NO ON REPEAL!
Thank you for the reminder! I called!
NO REPEAL NO REPLACE. FIX ACA!!!!!!!! Find somewhere else to give your cronies a big tax cut.
You keep your problem, I'm sorry promise, to gut the health care system and disrupt 1/5 of the economy.  I'm sure history will not be kind.
@SenateMajLdr Senator McConnell you are a complete failure as a leader . You don't care about voters in your own state . You are a disaster
@Alt_DeptofED I will vote yes because US corporate kleptos and pro-Putin Ukranian kleptos gave me big $$ to destroy US democracy
ALL MAJOR Medical organizations say #NoRepeal  #NoTrumpcare #FixObamacare
what a slick mob boss he is.
Already called and left a message will call back after office is open too.
and you will bankrupt this working taxpaying family (2 kids), then a death sentence for husband. daily,lifesaving treatment 72k yr. Thx nada
All should vote yes so it can be debated. Didn't Dems want a public debate ?
Let's not forget this is not abt h/c. It is ONLY to give the tax break to their very wealthy supporters. What is it..700billion?we pay again
How are we coming along on that #impeachment?
McConnell. Such a creepy guy
Call your @gop senator & ask them not to take away your healthcare. Or have no healthcare going forward. Live with #ACA, die with #trumpcare
This man would hand over his first born child to vote yes, to get something, anything to pass the GOP has put forward.
Vote no to save health care for all of us with pre existing conditions !!
What does tRumph have on you?
If McCain comes back to vote yes , he needs to retire
Thank you.  Call, call again and then,  pray. 
#NoRepeal
Fix it, enhance, don't repeal.
Nonononono. Yes I like that you fight everyday for Oregon.
Vote ( NO ) because this is an attack on the poor and to give the rich a big tax break and that not fair to the children.
God help your constituents, for they are so stupid and hill billy that they not what they do. #mitchmcconell
Hey Mitch, your support of President Trump, a self proclaimed sexual predator must make your family very proud... WWJD
Shame on you!
Did McConnell ever mention what those ACA failures were and how they would fix them?
Details details! Don't bother these important men with details!
Thanks, Mitch. Ignore the CBO score. Ignore the desires of the people. The most important thing is to destroy that evil black man.
Mitch McConnell  Russian off to make more $$$ & power off the misery & death of American Citizens
@gglightbulb Voting on a bill u know zip about is like being asked by a salesman to buy a car without knowing all about the car.
Stand strong
Vote No. Vote No. Vote No. Vote No.
FOLLOW THE RUSSIAN CONNECTION/MONEY FOLLOW IMPEACH TRUMP&CABINETS 2017 POWER2THE MEDIA POWER2THE PEOPLE JOIN THE RESISTANCE. FIX NOT REPEAL
Thanks Senator, but we need stronger, tougher tactics to fight the GOP dirt they engaged in to get these votes. Gloves off, now.
I called. Unfortunately @SenIsakson will always chose party over the good of the people. He DOES NOT CARE IF 22 million lose #healthcare
Horrible that daily we need to call Congress to remind them; stop stealing healthcare.Why won't they understand America doesn't support them
@leahmcelrath  show this to Mitch McConnell! Better yet, to his constituents!
Episode 6: "You Have The Right To A Lawyer, But Not To A Doctor." https://youtu.be/8LFS-_nJsnQ  via @YouTube Share w friends in KY, GA,FL,TX,MO!!
Ya think his supporters about to lose healthcare would storm the Bastille?
Mr McConnell, please get honest. I know it will be a challenge, but with help from Pence and Trump you should be fine. Just kidding. GROW UP

@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain 

Please RT…
The majority don't agree,  you don't care about we the people. Kentucky is the number one beneficiary of the Medicaid expansion. Shameful.
It's a travesty to call McConnell "Leader."
The Great Gray Turtle... Is a scammer!!!
If we live in a Blue state, is there anything we can do?
Watching you now on Rachel Madlow. Follow the money
and I will show up @ every event U R at begging you t2 pay 4 all my meds I will be unable to afford because I have no ins. due to pre-exist
Go home old man!  Vote him out already!
McConnell looks like one of those white guys in the 1800's. All he needs is a blonde wig.
Go get 'em, @RonWyden! ACA is complex & messy. So's democracy. They both work. 1/2
...When the GOP has an alternative for either that's better, I hope they let us read about it.  Until then, please keep us covered.  2/2
Keep up the good fight! But don't lose focus on other important issues like Net Neutrality, NATO, and Paris Accords.
Proud to hear you speak  on @chrislhayes tonight. Your message, your demeanor, you spoke the truth. Thank you for representing us.
WYDEN, a LIB LEFT ANARCHIST ATHIEST ANTI-AMERICAN FAKE !!
Thank you Senator Wyden for all your leadership
Who should I text and how?
Good showing on @MSNBC tonight sir. Thank you.

It's time to stop worrying about Trump's absurd tweets and start worrying about the dangerous legislation he and Republicans are pushing.
THE GOP HAS NOT RELEASE THE MEASURE THEY WILL BE VOTING ON. ONE SIX OF ECONOMY. GOP TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE.
Call @SenCoryGardner (202) 224-5941 and tell him to vote NO on taking HC away from millions of Americans! #HealthCare
Do you want Obamacare for your family? Oh I guess not that's why you passed a law that it doesn't apply to you. Horrible and cruel
Small business owner in Oregon. I'm asking you as my senator, to repeal the ACA. It's hurting my family.

Here's my idea for fixing healthcare in 6 tweets. https://twitter.com/TanyaGrahamDVM/status/889662329247465472 …
@AARP says NO to this repeal & replace that's 37 million votes NO @SenateMajLdr #NoOnDeathcare
We will ! Repeal the harmful bill by the democratic elites known as Obamacare #repeal asap
Repeal! We, the middle class, cannot afford Obamacare. Please vote REPEAL!
@SenateMajLdr Please vote No on motion to proceed, and any other attempt to doom Americans to the rapacious greed of insurance co.
In Fl we have basic needs issues. Housing, food, education now healthcare! It's a crisis for my fam. My country lets us down again if voting
It seems McConnell has no brain. He talks this crap in spite of Americans telling him NO.
thanks for your work, and @PattyMurray , @SenatorCantwell  @SenJeffMerkley  I'm thankful I live in the sane part of the country

#KillTheBill #Resist
You gotta wonder what this talking turd is getting out of this. 'Cause GOTDAMMMM is he eager!
Obamacare will be your demise
Yup!! In action here! Praying will of people prevails. No one wants to die or not get treated cuz GOP hates Obama.
Mitch McConnell couldn't care less about what his constituents think. He doesn't  care how many are going to suffer w/ no health insurance.
@SenateMajLdr  My hope is that 51 senators vote NO!
Call ALL you state reps & then your Governor! http://callyourrep.co !
Obamacare is not a failure.  The Reps are failures as moral Christian humans
Obamacare is a failure,  a financial disaster..
Mitch & McCain dragging america to drumpfcare
Pls inform Mr. McConnell he is no leader by taking 22 million people off healthcare coverage. He's a coward!
#Resist as if your life depends on it. Because it does
How could he be so cruel?
Please, spread the word on this chris wray story! It too is very important! Senate will be voting a sleezball! Please???
Chriz Wray is dishonest. Represented Chris Christie in the Bridgegate matter for 11 months at taxpayer expense. No records kept.
Taxpayers were in the dark for 11 months. Wray also is holding Christies cellphone, which might have incriminating evidence against Christie
Of course you will because you are a uncaring evil man!
@SenateMajLdr is a depraved ingrate: this man was cured of polio and lacks the human compassion to afford care and healing to others 4 money
Dear God,Needed very bad transportation issues in DC tommaro,I pray for multiple vehicle breakdowns,bus breakdowns,trains not running,rev jb
They can't enough votes if they can't get there !!!
Just heard you on Rachel Maddox. Your statements were clear. We are proud you are our Senator. Thank you!
#Trumpcare
I vote for "Traitor."
Hope he dies on his cross tomorrow
Every member of Congress and of the Senate has tax payer insurance and yet you want to leave us the taxpayers w/out insurance. That's FAIR?
they are creating a class system that will effect generations, research don't fall for it!
Just like in the grapes of wrath, the system will create a class of people that will be poor. rich men called poor whites white "nig...rs"
#ItsTimeForABiggerTable
don't fall for it guys not only will you suffer but generations will suffer, they are creating a class system..and you will be the new "N"
the job gop offers have high turnover, poor bosses, low benefits you will live paycheck to paycheck if you get sick your homeless.
Have they even communicated what's actually in the bill yet?
jobs with no benefits, working for slimy bosses, you won't even be able to afford a lawyer or send you kids to school, fast turnover.
GOP wants to give usa citizens jobs at the poverty level, keep you in debt live pay check to paycheck if you get sick you will be homeless.
Obamacare didn't fail your party is trying to sabotage. Why can't we have the same healthcare plan as federal judges, that would replace.
Explain $200 Billion given to non-profits to inform us about Obamacare.
Online audits and jail for carpetbaggers
We'd have more services if your friends would quit stealing from non-profits.
Comments please.
Mitch boy's going to Hell for this one
Health over wealth
Mitch McConnell ur about to go Jail for Mal Leadership & Obstruction of Justice with Speaker Paul Ryan & AG Sessions Mueller will have u all
I have been first to criticize @SenJeffMerkley & @RonWyden , but Ron stood very Tall Today.
It is cheaper to not have Insurance, use ZoomeCare, thanks to your signature passing the ACA.  Let the new leadership fix what you couldn't
You guys should work together to fix & tweek it not repeal it. Worthless DT just wants to undo all that BO did as well as his legacy just bc
No, this is not it. This is a motion to proceed, not a motion for the healthcare bill.
That should say Licker McConnell on that tweet right?

See linked thread and ReTweet if you agree.
It can be a way to hold GOP accountable
