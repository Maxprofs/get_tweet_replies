And all while denying intelligence community statements that Russia interfered with our elections. This is dangerous.
Although the hacking was wrong, democrats shouldn't have done what they did to help Hillary.  Accept responsibility.
um, she won the popular vote
Because of California.  She lost 30 states.
so you don't understand what popular vote means either
Yes, it means those extra votes only came from Cali. That's why popular vote doesn't matter.  At all.
wrong
Wow. No wonder we're in this mess. Apparently they don't understand basics. So CA isn't a state? "Doesn't count"???!
@donnabrazile Bizarre how long democrats choose crying over unity.
Why would I want to "unify" with evil?
Don't be dramatic.
reality is not drama. Trump is insane
Take your fake page and troll someone else.  The election is over.
@donnabrazile He's busy running insolvent businesses. All the incredulity bewilders; he's a charlatan-why the constant surprise?
cause many are still blinded or in the "give him a chance" phase 
We can only hope it's a phase--
sadly we wouldn't count on it for some
Pence is bad too tho both need nipped in the bud
.@RonWyden @WydenPress You worry about yourself Peanut Butter mouth!!
It's not bizarre. He's getting them. Just from a different country. #COMEON
not sure I want him to know anyway

@jdibb intelligence said Obama is only president to ignore their advice. Trump cabinet most INTELLIGENT in history! #MAGA
@donnabrazile  well Ron you at first have to find some intelligence in Washington to have a briefing!!
@donnabrazile but has time to watch every episode of Saturday Night Live.
@donnabrazile  And this is a guy who is going to bomb the "Sh$% out of ISIS?  God, this guy has got to go.
that's OK, he's getting all the help he needs from his BFF, Vladimir Putin.
my thought is that he's going to 'drain the swamp' at CIA and recruit a new Hitler Youth to control his American #BananaRepublic
didn't @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump and @FoxNews make such a brush anout @POTUS on this same issue even though it wasn't true???
why are you surprised. Intelligence is the key word. Over 140 characters he's done.
keep fighting and include repubs. Bi partisan is our only way to make anyone at WH notice. Good work
@donnabrazile #CrookedDonald is too busy grafting & selling out this nation foreign governments for #PDBs He doesn't care about us
bizare that Obama couldn't either huh?
http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obama-skips-intelligence-briefings/2012/09/11/id/451438/ …
I guess it's because tge world is such a simple place now, unlike it was during the Cold War or the filming of an episode of the Apprentice.
I think everyone knows he's too stupid to understand complex issues.
@DebraMessing It's not bizarre. He does not feel he needs to and delegates this to others. Dangerous.
Obama skips them as well.  Are you crying about that too?
@BBwriterchick
LOUD & PROUD, Ron. Hair on Fire Time. Please please, lead the charge to stop EC until report released or even better REVOTE
He is probably getting his intelligence briefings from Alex Jones and Info Wars
Don't forget Breitbart and SNL Parodies
Not just bizarre. Reflects dereliction of responsibilities. He has elevated a victory tour and tweeting above our nat'l security
.@RonWyden
Fact--Obama does not read his intelligence briefings nor does he get briefed in person by the CIA or DOD. Too busy I guess!
@donnabrazile Key word.......Intelligence! #notmypresident
@morgfair JLj
BTW, what is your opinion on #draftamericasdaughters2016? Do you think the enemy would rather capture & rape/torture them? Vote NO
@CNN no matter what Trump does, you will say it's wrong. We see through this. #oldnews #fakenews #liberalmedia. Yawn.
#CNN lol! #fakenews
@donnabrazile more like scary
why is Anyone shocked that he has a disregard for intelligence?  He wants an echo chamber.
#ImpeachTrump
Too busy getting them from Russia.
@donnabrazile "Dump Trump! His election don't pass the smell test"... 
he's got a direct Russian feed!
But he can make time to still produce Celebrity Apprentice. Sad.
Terrific interview guys !
@donnabrazile No biggie for now, there's still an adult in the White House who takes the job seriously and is being briefed.
Thank you for speaking out on this. This story needs constant attention and vigilance.
@donnabrazile Obama hasn't done much better
Former assistant secretary of defense  says "Intelligence is crafted to fit policy".
The same "intelligency agencies" that have repeatedly lied to get us into umpteen wars and overthrown multiple gov't
because he's nothing more than a carpetbagger...  #STOPTHECON
.@RonWyden @BershodM I guess he'll be surprised like George W when they start flying into tall buildings again?
http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/11/cia-directors-documentary-911-bush-213353 …
@DebraMessing FOR THE IMPAIRED:HE GETS DAILY INTEL BRIEFINGS VIA HARD COPY&VPE ATTENDS DAILY!IF U STILL DON'T GET IT, SEEK HELP!
well, when you've got "Celebrity Apprentice" producing to do, who cares if Russia blows us up.
May not be bad to pay less attention to securocrats talking about monsters under the bed. We need more focus on domestic issues.
@triplesss1001 key work intelligence
In Oregon, they call it 'delegation'.
@DebraMessing maybe if he wasn't so busy on his asinine 'victory' tour he'd have time for actually preparing himself for this job.
Thank you for pushing this issue.
thank you senator Wyden.   Please don't give up, and,please keep fighting for us.
@bosslady2898 it is bizarre you are absolutely correct we deserve to know the facts before trump takes office 
@Positividad3 
Clearly he's too busy w/hotels, twitter & soon, reality show producing.
If he can't do that, how is he going to stay on at his TV show in his "spare time"
Too busy tweeting, watching SNL & working on The Apprentice #PartTimePOTUS
But he has time to secure a 2nd job w/the Apprentice which he'll do in his 'spare time'
@ZenBonobo Whatever he needs to know his #Boo Putin will tell him.
he's too busy planning the next season of Celebrity Apprentice. Absolutely shameful.
I think it's more media making mountains out of mole hills. I trust he is getting the info he needs.
Life imitates art: https://youtu.be/tI3g_laToxE 
@donnabrazile head in the sand mentality...
He can make time for producing a reality show, however.
remarkable isn't it?Hmmm what happened the last time a Pres didn't pay attention to briefings?
was there a last time?
Ahhh yes... somewhere around Sept 11th, 2001
time for term limits in the Senate
why is our Senator on the proven Fake news network?
He is 2 busy with his thank you tour.Is he thanking the 3 mil more people who voted for Hillary.He should be thanking the antiquated system
@donnabrazile PEOTUS-no time for national security briefings cuz too busy being exec producer of a reality TV show. #wrong
@DebraMessing yet finds time for Celebrity Apprentice and keeping abreast f his business interests. #notpresidential
Keep the pressure on.
Thank you for making this a priority Senator.
@DebraMessing hey, he's on tour! 
42% for BHO is below average. http://www.g-a-i.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GAI-Report-PDB-Update-9.29.2014.pdf … Amazing how liberals suddenly think National Security is a good thing.
@donnabrazile 
There's nothing intelligent generated over the last 8 yrs, or US wouldn't be in this mess.Let DJT wait for his guys
He has no common sense, let alone traditional or any other type of intelligence.
@DebraMessing He would not understand what they were talking about anyway. It's all actually over his head.
@donnabrazile wow and CNN said it so it must be true fake news
@donnabrazile why not Killary voter fraud and crimes
Proof positive that he has no intelligence.  Not bizarre. He knows it all. "I know more than the Generals".

c'mon now, @realDonaldTrump has a TV SHOW to run! That's important work! #MakeTelevisionGreatAgain

it scares him
@TheMuseCompels he doesn't want to know BC he'd be responsible

Bizarre? He was elected because he's nontraditional. You shouldn't expect anything.
@donnabrazile Most everything about @realDonaldTrump is bizarre!
@DebraMessing Only surprising if you ignore who he really is.
We all know Biff is intellectually challenged bigly. Someone needs to explain things to him.
@DebraMessing but apparently will have time to continue working on his own show "in his spare time" 
@DebraMessing Obviously it's because he has no intelligence.
something his cult following will of course ignore, dispute or defend
@DebraMessing Maybe the word "intelligence" frightens him.
@LaurenKataya61 Allegedly. @CNN cannot be trusted after the election shenanigans.
not just cnn reporting this...there better be a review
@DebraMessing don't you have to intelligent first to read those types of briefs
@donnabrazile Too much detail and fact.  And cameras can't be present.
@MOVEprofPHD Maybe if he'd divest himself of his biz interests, "hobbies" & twitter he'd have time to focus on presidential tasks.
unfortunately not likely given his narcissism and questionable mental state
No argument from me there.
@donnabrazile at least he isn't golfing. He's building his cabinet.
@donnabrazile like O?
the sooner information about Russia mingling in our election process can be declassified the better.
Amen to that
@donnabrazile But he has time for "hobbies" such as Celebrity Apprentice!
That might be an advantage...
Thank you! Proud you represent us.
@donnabrazile Willfully misinterperitating public statment negativity reflects condesention to the People & Weakness to the World
@donnabrazile maybe he should give up his gig on the apprentice
why should he waste time w/briefings? Not why he's in the game. Will wing it next 4 yrs as POTUS then cash in.
you ignored the question about Russia. Stopped listening after that
@donnabrazile  Bizarre not the word..... Arrogant and stupid....
Here's my fav one: He has no time for intelligence briefings but will EP Celebrity Apprentice on his spare time.
I guess he really needs those royalty checks?
@donnabrazile irresponsible
@donnabrazile Hang black cloth or board on window 1/20 to show mourning over vile Trump presidency. Spread the word.
@donnabrazile Very strange!!!
Everything about Donald is bizarre
Refuses to hear real evidence that Russia interferes with US politics as it does in many countries. Bad influence.
@donnabrazile Or he knows how to keep them secret meetings.
Maybe he's concerned about betrayal.
They killed #JFK you know.
it seems Pence is getting more briefings so he's the one who's gonna be "President " obviously.
It's a great idea to give the VP more responsibility, as Pence is a "President in training."
@donnabrazile Well done Sir. Thank You for taking for speaking out.
it all sounds foreign to him because he doesn't understand or know anything plus he's not intelligent at all.
he has business intelligence and conning skills nothing more
why the neo-mccarythite crap! where are the hearings on nsa spying? cia crimes in syria? you are a coward wyden!
I'm guessing you're a Russian troll trying to spread false propaganda! Be gone with you!!
@donnabrazile he doesn't need briefings.  He doesn't believe our officials.  He uses Russian intelligence
@donnabrazile No! Stop labeling and making excuses for the insanity of this man You are all Complicit start legal action

BUT he will be able executive produce the apprentice in his spare time, so there's that.
but it's his job. #DoYourJob @realDonaldTrump
He doesn't attend briefings because he doesn't about the office of the President or the country. He cares about using it for money
@donnabrazile I keep telling you, intelligence is #trumpkin kryptonite
but can still be Exec prod of the apprentice? What?
@donnabrazile but he apparently has "spare time" for the apprentice. Listen up USA we r screwed
@donnabrazile Obama took very few of his intelligence briefings, so why the big deal now??Ohhh leftist are butthurt-yea that's it
"Obama took very few of his intelligence briefings, "

Where did you get THAT crap from?
probably Not So Breitbart or RightBart
@donnabrazile @CNN No news today.  Let's invite #RonWyden.  He's a funny guy.
I'm guessing you're a Russian troll trying to spread false propaganda! Be gone with you!!
@donnabrazile #CrookedDonald is a made for TV human being. @OurRevolution
@donnabrazile "Reportedly" Prolly the same reports that guaranteed Hillary's victory. You're being kept in the dark, losers.
@donnabrazile to help heal the butthurt
I'm guessing you're a Russian troll trying to spread false propaganda! Be gone with you!!
Because it is a lie! Fake news, at its best ... CNN is to blame on elections. If they reported truth instead of fake news.
lulz, keep hanging on to every word MainStreamMedia spews, but if you must remember that Obama IGNORED Them
I'm guessing you're a Russian troll trying to spread false propaganda! Be gone with you!!
