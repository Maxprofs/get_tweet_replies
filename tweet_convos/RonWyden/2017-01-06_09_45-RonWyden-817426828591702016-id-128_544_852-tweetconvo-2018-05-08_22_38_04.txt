I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.
@realDonaldTrump Obama did that so why not? Targeting reporters?
@realDonaldTrump PROOF would be nicebutyet again none!you guys should just shut up! We have been hacked over and over and crickets
Trumpty Dumpty sat on his wall, Trumpty Dumpty had a great fall
Hope so, he will do better than the NYT!
@jongarysteele Probably. He obviously has nothing else to do. He just passes the "hard stuff" to Wall Street or his kids.
@iyamtoo @realDonaldTrump yes because that's easier than governing. It's like suing people when he gets butt hurt
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump Maybe, so what if he does? You guys just can't stand losing the scoop! LOL
Thank you - this tweetmadness has to stop!
@realDonaldTrump just wants to make sure Russia is not getting the news first as in the past.
sounds like you are #triggered #ronwyden, why do you accept and work with #trump? #MAGAmindset
@realDonaldTrump   Then also direct an investigation into how Guilliani rc'd his insider FBI info before it went public
@realDonaldTrump #help #nomorenukes #bekindDonald
@jentaub @realDonaldTrump yes.  Just wait for the investigation into SNL!
oh and I am sure he is making a list of all the people who have called him a coward on twitter
gone need some aloe for that sick burn, peeotus
@realDonaldTrump Sen Wyden, you of all people should question people like Clapper who lied to you.
what do you think?
Better than murdering journalists and staffers: #VictorThorn #VinceFoster
That's fake news. You have credible references?
Do the math, the probabilities regarding Deaths surrounding Clintons Dixie Mafia. Or not.
Kind of the way Obama did.
Remember when Republicans complained that they thought @POTUS behaved too much like a king?
Yes.
Obama had a reporter arrested remember?
@jentaub @realDonaldTrump yep
.@RonWyden Like when Obama collected James Rosen's telephone records, emails and tracked his movements in 2010? 
Like that Ron?
After the check comes its funny listening to the old hens argue over who had the prune danish.
well most people buy the prune danish then seem so surprised that it gives them the shits.
@realDonaldTrump
By tweet no doubt because....???
@realDonaldTrump Yep! Welcome to the jungle republic, Ron. Sincerely, ur constituent.
There's every reason to believe he will do exactly that.
Prolly
@summerbrennan Rhetorical question right?
@summerbrennan @realDonaldTrump $20 says Nielsen gets investigated for rigged ratings
My God!  What next?
every one. And the lawsuits, oh so many.
Yes. And for this reason it's actually a good thing that he is now widely loathed within US intelligence agencies.
@realDonaldTrump if TS info was leaked to a news agency then that's illegal and needs to be investigated.
Isn't this beginning to threaten our constitutional right of Freedom of speech? Or has @realDonaldTrump still not read the it?
@realDonaldTrump Ron can you worry about Oregon?
With all due respect Senator (you are one of the few Dems I vote for) I like the immediacy of the Tweets. Why not unvarnished?
@realDonaldTrump  Cylvia Hayes was annoying.
@jongarysteele Trump & GOP are more concerned with Trump's ego! More Trump worries about status of his election, more unfit he is.
He will just have his enemies.. we Americans that speak against him....locked up!!
@Juniper_Rising NIXON ANYONE?
At least Nixon had brains.
@jongarysteele I think he is covering himself, in case he has to change his position. Not true if he doesn't know it first.  EGO!
@realDonaldTrump     Crazy that this outrages him, but Russia interfering with our democracy doesn't seem to concern him.
Is there any doubt in your mind?
Thank you for all your efforts, Senator, in the past and in the future, to protect our rights and democracy. Really.
Sounds like it. He is a classic narcissist. I worked for one briefly and he destroyed everyone but himself. I fear Trump will too.
Probably. Look at the Putin playbook and watch Trump and the GOP follow it.
@realDonaldTrump well,if you,TRAITOR, attended those intel briefings, you'd be in the know. QUE PENDEJO!
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump yes
Yes. It's called fascism.
@realDonaldTrump  If you'd go to the bloody briefings, Donny, you migh learn something.  Then again ...
100% he will.  #TrumpLies all the time and he will need to blame the Media for his lies.  

#LyingTrump is the New American Dream!
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump there has been enough corruption Sad he has to ask for investigations
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump no-but saw your comments on Plame/Libby.Inconsistent.Both investigations appropriate. #fireharwood
@realDonaldTrump  Maybe he would have seen it if he had attended his briefings!
you think?
But, it's okay for the Russians to see it?
is this constitutional?
With he make Nixon's enemies list mentality a goal?
@jongarysteele @realDonaldTrump maybe if you attended your intelligence briefings you'd be informed before NBC
.@RonWyden counting on you to fight hard. Proud to be Oregonian, proud you're my Senator, but very, very concerned about the future.
Kim - Completely agree with your statement.
@Phoenyxanon You bet!
@jongarysteele Anyone surprised by this hasn't been paying attention.
@Nord_Eh @realDonaldTrump I think we all know the answer to that. #ImpeachTrump
assume he could have seen sooner if he turned up to intelligence briefings
it's one of the things we hired him for, since regular politicians tend to do nothing about anything
@neilpX will @realDonaldTrump send in investigators to discover reason for bad Apprentice ratings
@realDonaldTrump Senator Wyden, did you miss the part where there was a leak of classified info?
@TheDailySchmuck BREAKING: POTUS @RealDonaldTrump orders drone strike on Rosie O'Donnell, Anderson Cooper, and kid from Twitter.
@TheDailySchmuck Seems like that would distract from initiating social media attacks on anyone who criticizes him...
@realDonaldTrump More concerned with news leaks vs Intel briefings about Russia. How is this happening? Sorry, feels treasonous
Obama used the IRS and other GOV dept power to bully and harass the American people. Trump is America first.
Evidence?
The 5th was plead more than any other time in history. Theirs your proof. Action not just words
The fact that the fifth was PLED is not proof that THERE  was deception.
Why else would anyone plead the 5th. It is a response to guilt. Otherwise they would w/o hesitation, tell the truth.
Not necessarily.  Might be for other reasons.  Perhaps some answers would require revealing classified info.
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump 
Excuse me, are we in Junior High? Childish behavior.
@realDonaldTrump how did it leak so fast is the problem.
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump leaking intel for political gain is an annoyance?
@JohnJHarwood Let's hope so since nothing our govt. does is as it seems. Transparency to them is like sunlight to vampires. 
Agreed
RIGHT, because it isn't a national disgrace to that our intelligence is leaking top secret info to colluding media propagandists.
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump grow up donald
Sound a lot like Nixon doesn't it.
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump Not about an annoyance. It's about MSM colluding with Hillary & dems bc they lost. #DTS
Tske off your blinders.
No blinders. That would be the liberal trolls.   You must be a CNN fake news follower
I would ask you where you get your real news but I never get an answer from Trumpsters, maybe beause they have none,
I will not play your game.
@realDonaldTrump yes. He likely will. Watch this and everything will make sense. https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5mb8ue/donald_trump_a_true_narcissistic_sociopath_2000_a/?st=IXM05R87&sh=87c811e3 …
@JohnJHarwood @realDonaldTrump Ron, do you care about leaked confidential information or is it only serious when you deem it so?
yes.  Your job will  be  even harder and more important in these  coming years Senator. Take care and be strong for  us all. Thnx
twitter  Trump is just a Traitor in  hiding
- too many syllables. He needs smarter minds to spin it for him.
Seems likely, as his feelings *are* his priorities. Full stop.
@HaroldWNelson @realDonaldTrump would like to emulate what Putin does in Russia: complete control of Courts,Parliament,Prosecution
And murder of journalists.
Just pat Trump on the head, give him a lollipop, and send him back outside to play. Tell him the grown-ups have to work now.
@realDonaldTrump he wants to investigate that but not the Russians, scary!
Why is Donny worried about "fake intelligence" anyway?
Fix the fricken voting system. Crosscheck is manipulating elections.  Why hasn't the voting system been fixed.
@JohnJHarwood going after journalists doing their job. No surprise. A miniscule human being self absorbed to nth degree.
he's asking those who already pay lip service to investigate? we almost would lol if not so jarring
@realDonaldTrump let's see our electrol college votes Wow 50 illegal electoral votes in favor of president elect trump
what, they wouldn't take his call?
@realDonaldTrump intel findings are correct Russians hacked our elections
@gregpmiller @realDonaldTrump yes.
What can be done about this? Who will hold him accountable for abuse of power?
@IM4NY @realDonaldTrump he wants to investigate for his sake, but has no concerns about hacking US elections
@realDonaldTrump Demand to see Trump's taxes to know conflicts of interest. Why does he love Russia so much? $$$$
What's really funny is that Trumpsters' default response to this hacking is SHOW ME PROOF and now it's THAT PROOF WAS LEAKED!
@JohnJHarwood Maybe he'll wiretap the reporters parents.
- shouldn't you be busy working on the next bill to legalize child prostitution?
@realDonaldTrump Mexico is not going to pay for the wall once Roman Empire built no changes
How very putinesque of him.
probably
that wouldn´t be good. But it should be reminded that Obama has been the president who has been doing that more than any other...
do you remember, ie: James Risen ???
Thank you for calling attention to this --it is disturbing.
so..
I want to file an investigation into @realDonaldTrump filing investigations before he's the president.
That should prove to be interesting since @realDonaldTrump doesn't seem to be interested in "intelligence."
He's most concerned with appearances and who's loyal to him, so I'd say....yes.
probably if it involves leaked classified information. Obama admin aggressively went after whistleblowers. Did you care then?
replace "Obama admin" with "Government" and that would be an even more accurate statement #GovtIsTheProblem
Why do we need the FBI, CIA, and NSA when we'll have the KGB to take care of that?
he will if .@SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan allow him to.
Ron Wyden?
Somewhere in Oregon, a village is missing it's idiot.
thank you Senator Wyden. Keep on him, Oregon is fully behind you!
