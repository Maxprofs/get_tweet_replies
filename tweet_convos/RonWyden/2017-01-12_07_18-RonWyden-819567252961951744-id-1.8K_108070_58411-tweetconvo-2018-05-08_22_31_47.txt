@CloudContact @RonWyden Excuse the slightly vulgar/accurate term,but I'm ENCOURAGED to hear there are still PPL in DC w/BALLS
Unfortunately, not nearly enough.
When we switch back to Paper Voting Ballots the Republican Party and the Freedom Caucus will be a thing of the past! They win if they cheat!
And that lmao
We definitely do not care. We do however, care about investigating Clinton's involvement in the murder of Seth Rich.
You betcha!!!
Great work!
What did you think when Obama had his records hidden in 08 ?.   bet ya wasn't concerned then.    Fake fucks in dc
why should anyone care about Trump tax returns? This only serves to promote class envy
trump would have to develop some class in order to be envied by anyone with common sense.  & we care b/c he clearly is hiding something as he refuses to release them--personally i think the speculation about russia is a little shaky, but i do think he needs to develop integrity
Blah blah we don't care. We care more about criminals and illegals. To bad the swamp clowns don't.
A bit rich for Chris Murphy to be demanding financial accountability from Trump.  Paying taxes and mortgages ain’t the best part of this Senators resume. Bad messenger.  With that said, DT should release his taxes.
Your bill is good, but less important now that Mueller's undoubtedly got the returns, don't you think?  Maybe direct your efforts towards protecting Net Neutrality; or stopping the so-called "tax reform;" or following-up the Russian sanctions; or ... etc ....
Oh hell yes, I agree!
Jan 2016 almost a year the dream is dead but the tweet remains.
Got other stuff to worry about
Go fuk yourself
Duh - we really care NOT!!!
Funny I missed that in con law class. Not only do you have no right but if  dumb enough to think that bill gives you right you are a fool.
NOBODY DOES BUT THE WACKOS!
No FU, enough with the tax returns. He is duly elected president. Let him do his job, get out of the way.
I care! A LOT! I hope you persist!! 
I care... you care... most of us care... but to Trump we are all no one.
, I created a http://WhiteHouse.gov  petition too, just to show DJT we DO care. 
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/those-running-president-united-states-should-be-lawfully-required-release-their-tax-returns …
Why? How will it affect your life?Didn't the Clintons fraud Found. take big $$ from other countries
The president’s allegiance being the American public & not only wealthy/foreign powers, affects every aspect of all our lives.
like this
Focus on those IN POWER, not characters from the political soap opera of the last year.
So now there's new rules but lets forget about all the corruption for the last 8 years. Got it
to ur point: how did Sec of State’s Fdn affect you? How did emails affect your life? Why are you mad? Bc you were TOLD to be.
Not mad, we won. Yes affects my life because econ. is changing 4 the better & the corrupt swamp is drained. 401k doing well
Lets see yours and Ron’s too. Both wealthy men, how did you do that
This is what Trump fears most ! That's where the sins reside that when finally exposed , not even his blind mice can't save him!
But presidents give up their right to privacy when they hold a public office.
Many other federal officials are required by law to submit their taxes. The
President should be held to the same standard, if not even a higher one.
are you ok with him profiting from the Presidency?
@elhofferdesign @RonWyden why do you care so much?
he has the right to keep it private. Go ahead, post yours. While your at it, post your salary too.
you realize that president is different from every other job in the country, with different requirements, right?
doesn't mean his basic rights should be revoked
it is not a basic right, I give up my history for security clearance, politicians give up their privacy for public office.
@k_welty please never retweet anything of @chrisMurphyCT 's again. at least until you become a seaman yourself. hmm?
why it's not law get over straighten out Democrats mess and clean up their foul mouth and craziness do something good go volunteer
Nothing trump says matter. 
Except the opposite of what he says is normally true
Here ya go: They’re underneath Obama’s college records, his birth record, his passport application, his immigration status as a student, 1/2
funding source to pay for college, his college records, his selective service registration, and Hillary’s  2/3
email log and 66,000 missing emails. Have fun! 3/3
good luck tho
I care very much,
Still!
BREAKING: As usual, when @realDonaldTrump lips moved, he lied. And affliction of jaw muscles? Who knows, but it is consistent.
#Resistance
Before you waste our taxdollars on this legislation, can u wait for the audit to end?  He said he'd release when the audit was over.
@ChrisMurphyCT What do you think it means when R's protect his returns like they are? It seems like they all have something to hide! What?
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT TRUMP TAXES!!!
STOP WASTING OUR TAX DOLLARS!
YOUR ON THE PEOPLE'S TIME!
 We care about putting #AmericaFirst ! 
@brookselaine70 @RonWyden all of us who protested Trump's tax returns yesterday did out of love for our Country !
It will never happer the GOP and trump dont have abide by the law or the constitution.  Democracy is a thing of the past America is doomed
No Trump fan, here, but if there was something explosively critical there wouldn't the IRS have moved by now?
Phoenix, AZ Not one soda truck or free money from soros showed up! Just US Americans who are fed up! #ReleaseTheReturns #ImpeachTrump
How much did u pay each person to retweet this. Lolol just kidding I don't wear tin foil hats
Please hold Dump accountable for calling for Obama to UNCONSTITUTIONALLY show his birth certificate. @claudinerlco @RonWyden
Yes!
Agree
Please hurry.  Trump may get us all killed very soon.

@realDonaldTrump. TAXES TAXES TAXES!
We need to see all the Russian bribe money that's been flowing in for years. Russia's been making inroads for years: trump, Koch bros, etc
Yes...Trump needs to release his TAXES!
Sad part about this is I believe he actually believes these things!Shows he is not for real!
How about every #tbTurdsday, we do this.
Yes
What is the status of this bill?
Yes plz, there r millions of ppl out here who want 2 c if he actually files & r they legit?
Of course we agree!
@murphy_gw @RonWyden Absolutely agree and will divulge his dealings with Russian money laundering and illegal transactions!
@vkkroe @RonWyden getting to the point where we the people don't matter Jared is offer to help him, investigation is on him
@Veritaph @RonWyden millions care about it!!! And he knows it!!!
@IndivisibleFL12 @RonWyden @marcorubio People of FL stand up & demand honesty
@stressgirl70 @RonWyden today no one @CNN area about #RussiaProtests. Are we state run media yet?
He has done everything he can to bring the nation to its knees. His tax returns will tell us why...
Please people, keep retweeting. His tax returns will reveal so very much...
Where is it? This was more than two months ago.
@Tcatzmeow @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump @POTUS RELEASE THOSE TAXES NOW OR WATCH PROTEST DRAG YOU OUT OF WH SOON. #WARNED
@Roxy4080 @RonWyden but do we really need proof he's a Russian agent? We know, we just know. Mobilize your base to impeach.

Yes, yes, yes, thank you, thank you, thank you!
@Ladybug014 @RonWyden SHOULDVE BEEN MANDATORY BEFORE THE ELECTION, and maybe wr wouldn't have this #Manchurian candidate
@DebbiebB15 @RonWyden And he, and his daughter/son-in-law need to divest immediately. This is ludicrous
@DebbiebB15 @RonWyden I'm honestly sick of people that say we don't want to see them.  It's clear we do & easy for him to do.
@hairymelvin @RonWyden  Proof positive that Trump is a delusional grumpy old madman living in his own alternative reality.
there's a petition already at the whitehouse w/1,083,936 signature & being reviewed? Use that fact.
Not just his personal taxes, but the taxes of Trump Organization. His son said lots of Russian money comes in there
Best of luck with that...
this isn't an example of self incrimination, is it?
????????? what happened, it is March 19th.... how many more retweets do you need? #trumptaxes ???????
@DeliliaOMalley @RonWyd. RELEASE YOUR TAXES! Just like every other pres has. You can't can you? If you do it'll get you out!
I care and will continue to push until they are released. Many, many Americans care! @SenatorBurr

@Congress @Senate @RealDonaldTrump @FoxNews Trump Is Wrong! What Is He Hiding? Show Your Taxes! 20 Years Worth Now
.@ChrisMurphyCT @LovelyLowEnd @RonWyden There is a good reason Trump won't release his tax returns: He has got something to hide.
Good luck with that.  Somewhere over the rainbow you'll figure out how congress works IRL.
