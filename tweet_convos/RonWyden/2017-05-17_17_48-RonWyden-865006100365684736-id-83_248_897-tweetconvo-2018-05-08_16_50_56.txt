I'm sure you wanted an investigation into the Clinton foundation too, right?
Why would anyone want to investigate a 4 star rated charity. Do people willing to help others scare you that much?
Rather than insult everyone's intelligence with your ignorance, look up their ratings. Then you can come back and apologize to us all
Look up the ratings?  Sorry, but the released emails from wiki raises very good questions.  Don't trust HRC or most established politicians
So basically, you know that you are wrong and prefer remaining willfully ignorant than apologize
Look, I see that you completely trust the gov,  but don't the leaked emails raise any questions?
I see you are gullible enough to believe anything run through Russia first son. What a gullible laughingstock
Thank you @RonWyden for everything you are doing to Keep America safe!  You have my support! #Trumprussia
So you would like to further poison relations with a major Nuclear Power for partisan political reasons. Yeah you're a real hero.
Hi putin bot
Good one. Does Soros pay you by the tweet that or is this an automatic twitter reply using algorithms to detect anti-Syrian war sentiment?
Ah yes, the predictable antisemitism from a feeble minded idiot.
Really think that is a good use of your time? A productive idea would be working on the skyrocketing price of Obama care in Oregon.
We need #TermLimits
What do you hope to accomplish by insulting everyone's intelligence with your blatant BS
You shouldn't use big words you don't understand kid
Go get them all @RonWyden #pitbullWyden Wyden for president 2020. Tough, honest statesman
Read 1 Corinthians 6:9-12..Luke 13..Revelation 22:15.

Good, then we can finally jail the Clintons.
Impotent deflection does not work for trump, what makes you think it would work for one of his ignorant lackies like you?

How about backing Term Limits
Thank you, Sen. Wyden!  It's going to be a looong summer!

No wonder Oregon is in a mess.
Follow the money given to the Clinton foundation
Of course, that then answers why foreign nations contributed while she was Sec of State.  No problem there right
Why are you bringing up Clinton? That's public info, everything is transparent.
Thank you, Sen. Wyden, for your integrity and hard work.  So grateful for adherence to ethical, humanitarian, and ecological values.
Embarrassing to be an Oregonian. Thanks ron
where's the intern with a blue dress who take one for the team this time.. ugh...it's America n it's just great
#inners I'm a huge soccer fan but I don't let countries like Russia control our country
#inners President Trump had the Mrs. Universe & The Apprentice show on @nbc now the FIFA #WorldCup
#inners he has control of our country via President Trump
#inners Putin thinks that just because the FIFA #WorldCup is going to take place in his country & @NBCSports has the rights to air it
#inners this is an investigation the FBI already started years ago & is relevant now more than ever
Good Job! The money is a good way to track what Trump's involvement is with Russia.
I am so thankful @RonWyden is my senator from Oregon. Doing the right things--a patriot !
Thanks for wasting time on a witch hunt instead of doing anything for your State.
