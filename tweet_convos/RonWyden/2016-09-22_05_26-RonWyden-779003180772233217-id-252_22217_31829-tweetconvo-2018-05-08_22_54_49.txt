just discovered Nyt book review podcast!  You are great interviewer. Great cast!
Thank you!
.@PamelaPaulNYT Its back page of an 8-page special editorial section on the opening of new Smithsonian museum on the African American story.
Native Americans are still not viewed as being equally human. They are sent out back while company visits.  But still in our age of speaking out, who will talk about them or how they were treated.
Yes indeed.  You are so right, and I applaud that and you.

Open ways to my window - 
Of Eternal Divine - 
Where Love, neverending - 
Surrounds all the time
By Debra (Bonner) Nester, c2014
@skeller85 @GeorgeTakei And then they will start chanting about taking their country back, Sad...
One of my favorite Langston Hughes poems (of many).
For them, I share my poem:
"Angel Windows of Eternal Divine"
An Angel to guide me - 
A Light on my path -

I'm Irish and I want to bitch and complain about the anti Irish laws from 100 years ago. I'm oppressed! Familiar?
when you walk down the street in a sweater, youre not viewed as a criminal. You DO NOT get to compare
that's be people who look like me don't commit 60 % of the crime when only making up 7% of population:)
Sir, you may want to acquaint yourself with books & facts.
In 2013 660,000 interracial crimes reported. Blacks committed 85% of attacks #factshurt
This unsupported statement doesn't support your earlier false statement & is not a fact.
We need more space like this for poetry, Thank you, @nytimes!
Transcendent, as Hughes always was.
Beautiful beautiful...
Also to read and reread: "Beaumont to Detroit: 1943."
Hughes about democracy: https://worldcitizenship.com/news/democracy_1822 …
So touching
As an immigrant and Muslim, "I, too, sing America" http://www.pbs.org/newshour/poetry/humble-one-liners-can-teach-us-times-live/ … I do hope you might support my latest song, 'Where Epics Fail' 
Thank you to the Times, & to you for calling attention to it.
Powerful poem, for powerless moment!

@adreamingskin @nytimes In Ireland 10 year old girl read that poem at assembly the day Obama was inaugurated. Unforgettable.
My father taught me this poem when I was a little girl about 8 years old. I still know it by heart.
Your coverage about Russian Revolution in NY Review of Books is a shit, indeed... Ideologically slanting...
Thank you for the Review for the Twitter and for keeping faith in the beacon of books                        Steve Gunter retired teacher
I've read it a few time and taught a class on   Hughes, Cesaire and Sartre.
Beautiful 
@ITooArts !!!!!
> So wonderful to see Langston's work continue to shine and unite!
: garbage. We're all equal here - unless you choose to be a victim. @ABPardue @nytimes
wow you fool! No one chooses to be systematically discriminated!
Great poem. We all need to remember.
Reminding me of the non_warm welcome Josephine Baker got ,back in the US
Pamela, Langston Hughes is larger than life and was friends with Thurgood Marshall. I discovered that when watching the movie MARSHALL. Check it out.
@karolinandrea18

@iJesseWilliams @nytimes one of my favorite poems
I met Milos more than 30 years ago at school. He's old hat nastiness
@clayhensley @nytimes So moving!
@JenniferSkyreal Far worse: a maid for a day made to eat lunch on back porch. Not in our house 1950s. Dining room!
@fuggirls Outdated,wow do people  in NYC & LA still think like that because most Americans don’t. What condescension
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/47558 …  here is a legible copy
They also speak about Guns & they call it poetics. They silence us and they call it poetics! The children of Nazis..
#Nazis are speaking of Poetics! Strange! here is a video they silencing my Reason by force
Great poem. Thanks!
I 'hear' what the poet is 'saying' but historically all cultures have been 'enslaved' at the hands of all cultures.
hey @shinaeg check out this poem it's beautiful

Beautiful words! Thanks for sharing! #Gratitudesocialmediachallenge
@asnhayes @nytimes Just bought the kids book of this to share with my little ones.
@lidiabayne @nytimes interesting that it was written 60 years ago at the height of segregation
@julieplec @nyti Гай яфйхйег  mes
Favorite poem of his. :D
Many people don't now Langston Hughes brought us the gift of Thurgood Marshall, too. (Mentored him.)
Huge fan of the Harlem Renaissance.  Loved teaching it when I taught HS American Literature
wonderful!
Whites are less than 12% of the PLANETS population. Everyone else is non-white. Time for action racists. Help Whites
This is pushing violence against Whites which are the TRUE minorities. We will not be punished in our own Countries
@rcallimachi @nytimes well not every one
Beautiful words. Sad that this was first published in 1926 & still resonates today.
is there something great behind that poem ,I don't understand ? 
@chris_tpage @nytimes Get your own house and eat in whatever room you want.
A poem by a man that wouldn't have been reviewed in the book review -
@soledadobrien @nytimes Thank you for sharing and for all the positive feedback!
To all who lived this who served as well as ate in those kitchens, and died just  because. I mourn . BLM
@Pearlie_mack @nytimes I used to teach that poem in class when I taught adult high school. It's truly beautiful.

Langston Hughes one of our great great poets
That wld be the @nytimes that hasn't seen fit to review the first complete annotated ed of Poems of TSEliot? @PamelaPaulNYT @CaiminsEnglish
progress
A full page in @nytimes dedicated to a poem. One that everyone should read and reread.  @PamelaPaulNYT @Jason__Ramsey
beautiful poem
@rcallimachi @nytimes  typical NYT race baiting and divisiveness.  Deplorable.
Before the vignette here, there was an American need to arrange society this way. Claimed falsely as people of God.
@rcallimachi @nytimes 
I KNEW there was a reason I should've bought the NYT today when I was in Starbucks. Gotta learn to trust my gut. :(
A poem that hasn't been relevant in decades... so... touching? You realise slavery in america is long dead right?
Great poem
Thanks for retweeting that, sista!
there's a beautiful children's book of this!
A beautiful book indeed.  Thanks for sharing it, @EmilySenefeld. @PamelaPaulNYT @nytimes
amazing
beautiful
One of my favorites!
@AVAETC @nytimes always loved that they were teaching Hughes to my son in kindergarten. Now means even more.
The message of @NMAAHC as well.
beautiful #StopRacism
Brilliant and profound.
I learned this in the 5th grade 1970. Made my 22 year old son learn it at 8. He recites it every year at Kwanzaa.
By Langston Hughes RT @PamelaPaulNYT: A full page in @nytimes tdy dedicated to a poem. One that everyone should read
... Amazing. Just a shame most voting for @realDonaldTrump are too stupid to read.
@nonleggerlo @nytimes esticats?
@Altair77 @nytimes beautiful. Was it sponsored by new museum on AA history? (Can't see entire top left corner.)
I've always loved this poem. Thanks.
maybe it would help if people stopped identifying as Afro American then...it might help to assimilate?
Maybe, but your water will still have lead in it.
wonderful poem!
@IMcMillan @nytimes Americe may be pure and innocent but are all the people who inhabit it just as clean?
Read the words
And
Heed the words !
RT this poem 2 million times!
It sounds sweet & lovely, but if Black ppl lived passively this way, we'd still be in chains.
@missmayim @PamelaPaulNYT @nytimes I have always hated this poem! We can't sit quietly & wait 4 a seat tomorrow.  We have 2 demand 1 today.
DATS DA ONE
Langston Hughes. *historic* o_o7
@hankdeleo @nytimes Not just "a poem," but seminal anthem by Langston Hughes, the stunning statement of "I, too, am America."
lovely poem. Claps 
@rubycramer @nytimes Beautiful.
@marktheshark @nytimes thanks for sharing. Poetic imagination is what will move us forward together.

"Tolerance" and "equality," while better than the alternatives, shouldn't be the goal. "Love" and "equity" should be @PamelaPaulNYT @nytimes
@BMoreAuthentic Langston.
I have loved him all of my life. This makes me so happy.
It's beautiful. I used to teach my 1st graders about Langston. He inspires me all the time.
Mother to Son is my favorite. I also adore the "Simple" series. I wll  bw back at the Schomburg soon.
Sokay. #HTGAWM is on anyway. Ha!
Act like an American. Prosperity will follow.
I wonder how many the US could not tolerate a 'Truth and Reconciliation Commission'?
a poem i once read with pride now stained by tones of disdain and sarcasm
no the sarcasm is coming from you
@LauraAMoran first published 90 years ago...
Langston Hughes: a truly American poet.
@7bugglettes @nytimes Excellent and thought provoking.
A beautiful poem. Thank you.
@joshgroban @nytimes What a Wonderful Poem!!!!
The "darker brother" has been president for 8 years and race relations are worse than ever. So now what?
Hughes is incredible. Speaks about America & Americans. Thank you Langston for reminding us.
So true
@ClaraJeffery @nytimes Langston Hughes is my fav.
I read this in high school, it's a beautiful poem
@DFWCON @nytimes Tomorrow they should print "Let America Be America Again." Same poet.
Indeed a MUST READ by everyone!
@johngreen @nytimes @saphiaax @NaarahKnuckles
@MormonLiberals @nytimes Amen!
@Loverdesart @PamelaPaulNYT @nytimes Thanks for the follow
I-2 = USA
this is great. Thank you!
so this guy's answer to racism is violence, or the projection of violence, bet he wasn't an MLK fan
@wrenawrites @nytimes great poem!
Yes, L Hughes is such a powerful poet! So is W Whitman, who wrote "I Hear America Singing". I love Hughes's confident reply!
you can hear Whitman endorsing this from beyond the grave.
.@nytimes Perhaps now the Gray Lady will start calling Trump a liar, racist, and fascist, instead of dancing round the truths
@katiegboucher @nytimes I've posted this on my blog. Love Langston Hughes
Georgetown U hosts musical performance of poem Friday at 1:15 https://performingarts.georgetown.edu/MargaretBonds 
Georgetown U hosts musical performance of poem Friday @ 1:15 https://performingarts.georgetown.edu/MargaretBonds 
Yes.
@johngreen @nytimes appropriate timing... Langston Hughes too, brilliant
wow. A poem about house slaves. So is this a recent poem? If so, the poet should be told there is no longer slavery.
Research the poet. You'll have your answer.
@hi_cherie  
I was so pleased to see that this was Langston Hughes.
Beautiful! Thank you.  I remember when the nyt was actually worth reading.
Beautiful words from the past work just as well today.
Besides, They'll see how Beautiful I am, and be ashamed.  I Too Am America.  Langston Hughes peered into the future.

Very nicely written
thank you! RT in Canada #Poets #Writers teach change worlds #LangstonHughes beauty
really, really excellent

@kathoderaytube @nytimes Langston Hughes wrote more than one great poem like this: read him and find the truth
thanks so much for sharing a timely piece from one of the greatest poets of our time
@LLQJ206 @nytimes Someday...
thank you so much for this, I think we all needed it.
I TOO - CANNOT READ IT BECAUSE THE PHOTO IS TWO SMALL!
@Kris_Sacrebleu @nytimes  Unfortunately not everyone can read...North Carolina comes to mind...
1/ I used this when I did my stdt teaching in 8th gr. Soc.Stu. Had the kids read it...
2/... the write a version from their own personal POV, then again...
3/... as a member of an historical minority group to which they did not belong.
4/ It ended up being a very powerful lesson in empathy.
thank you for sharing
