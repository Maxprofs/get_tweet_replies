Watch: The moment when women everywhere agreed with Sen Harris after she was interrupted by Burr who didn't do the same w King & others 
Because she's a she & you're a he. Male chauvinism on full display. Nevertheless, she persisted. And yes @SenatorBurr - voters noticed.
Yes we noticed senator Burr. Ashamed that you represent NC. I thought We taught our men to act better than that in NC.
Let's hope the voters are kicking ass and taking names. And remember when these people come up for re-election.
Middle USA noted the reason for the hearing was 702. Safety of US Citizens. Dems never got on subject and they care zero for Citizen Safety!
They were asked whether about pressure by POTUS to help derail investigation of #TrumpRussia. Idea Dems don't care abt safety is nonsense.
Really. They do not and they prove it each and every day. Sanctuary cities is a classic example. Not strong vetting is another.
Facts don't bear that out. Plenty of info on that out there if you expand reading beyond Fox News, Brietbart & InfoWars.
Actions speak louder than words. If you can't see it then the DNC agenda is imprinted in your brain. Take a trip to the border and ask!
Well evidently Rogers and Burr felt as if that little girl forgot her place. Didn't she have dishes to do?
Straight up. On full display.
Senator Ron Wyden everyone, a principled man who can understand the nuances of conversation. Thank you sir, for being an american.
The Nuance that @POTUS has never been under any FBI Investigation! There's the NUANCE!
Did you say never? Bad choice especially since comey testified he was not working anymore.and flynn is under a criminal one.
Yes I did and am still saying it. You forget Obama ran surveillance 18 mos.
That would easily explain all this weird random surveillance.
Nothing Random about it! Have you read the Dennis Montgomery Brief?
Reality winners. Heck give it to the kost conservative reputable newspaper. It will get picked up. Dont dilute the fact that every reporter

She should have persisted.
Wyden. Please go hide under your desk and smoke some more hemp. Just another #PatheticPolitician who's #BrainDead
It was a shameful display of misogyny by Senater Burr. She should not have been silenced. Thank you for pointing out this double standard
Well she should have let Jeff answer the Damn questions. She should have been told to shut the hell up.
This happens a lot to women, especially Black women.
Yes. Especially the part about being courteous... what? Wait, what? Is this real life? Who are you?
Same thing as Elizabeth Warren. GOP men think they are above women and this is the 1900 hundreds .Makes them look small and petty
GOP man-tra
Exactly. Several colleagues were visibly agitated, yet she was the only one interrupted. As a country we need to move on from this bullshit.
When men are held accountable for such blatant discrimination against 51% of the population, we might "move on."
I agree. This is ridiculous. It's 2017.
Proof that Mysogyny is alive and well.
We witnessed it done with E. Warren
Yep! "She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.‚Äù - Mitch McConnell, Senate Mysogyny Leader #TheResistance
Something tells me u didn't actually watch the hearing, rather just talking about something u know nothing about #ignoramus
The country becomes more divided when people turn normal things into problems. Not every time a woman is silenced is it automatically sexist
I watched it. She was clearly held to a different standard.
greatful that you observed that blatantly biased and restrictive action ... predjudice in action
Thank you Senator Wyden!
its always like that. always
Wyden is Sylvester the Cat..
Omg this is so WEIRD
Yo, call it out when it's happening then! Time for some of y'all to speak up. To hell with appropriate behavior
Thank you for acknowledging the double standard. Help make it stop
@SenatorBurr could use a hardy tump to the forehead the next time he interrupts a woman Senator this disrespectfully! We are watching sir!
hey Ron. Will U PLZ retire? UR doing Oregon & USA a disservice.Mebbe U shld be cut off as well
To be fair, Republicans think all women are 2nd class citizens, no matter their bona fides and achievements.
Idiot
her smirk says it all...some ridiculous bullshit
It was straight up blatant misogamy, just as with Senator Warren! We have come a long way in my 50 years & we are still standing in place!
unacceptable!
Our current "regime" allows blatant disrespect and objectification of women
"But she persisted". 
He is a deplorable "human being" @senatorburr
Senator Burr should resign.
Burr is not use to letting ladies or non whites speak in public.
Thank you Sen. Wyden for pointing out this double standard and rude behavior
I don't know what you're trying to say...
burr was rude and unfair.
Wow! Telling testimony given by Comey. Sen Burr needs to be taken to the woodshed for his biased attitude towards Sen Harris.
She's a pesky woman. NOT!
These old men who do not respect women need to go.
That's because @SenatorBurr was a whiny scaredy-cat over the answers.
Millions of women are showing no surprise at this. Sadly
What is the deal with NC? With all the shenanigans by their elected officials, I'd be embarrassed to live there.
thank u for noticing the typical double standard and rudeness toward women by these creeps
because weak men are threatened #GirlsWIthBalls
Strong men aren't
Welcome to our world. Every damn day
Love you Ron.
Thank you Mr. Wyden.
Sen. Wyden & Harris r both rude! R we trying 2 decide which is more rude and lacks decorum the most?
Exactly
@derek_petersen
Burr is one of our Good Ole Boys. She's a "colored woman"... can't be havin her talk to a white man like that. 
She's a woman and gets treated like crap
This is the way it is still. Women are interrupted and marginalized at every turn.
@SenAngusKing wasn't interrupted during his blistering questioning either. Country over party please, @gop.
No 1 interrupted @SenAngusKing when he got tough. @SenKamalaHarris was interrupted when she was doing her job bc she's a woman. Truth.
That's because Senator Burr is a sexist old coot. Hope he is replaced by a strong progressive woman in 2022 (or sooner )
@SenatorBurr has not only a gender problem but a race one also.  #comeyDay #comey #trumpRussia #impeach obstruction has already been proven
Unreal.
Women everywhere have had enough of this type of discrimination. We will not be silenced anymore. #persist
disgusting
And then Rosenstein wouldn't even look at her when he answered.
- we the people need to hear the questions and the answers - evasiveness cannot be tolerated
He's saying " know your place Bessie"!
We all saw it!
Thank you Senator Wyden 4 truth-telling and not gaslighting women when they see obvious sexism.
@momaura @SenKamalaHarris @SenatorBurr @yottapoint but should have been...
Like no one in GOP will rein in Trump, no one in the Senate has the guts to make these arrogant self-righteous MEN be respectful of Women
Next time a woman is mistreated like Sen Harris then MEN will STAND up interrupt  Burr-say NO this is discrimination & WRONG- let her speak
Pig.
Bottomline: @SenKamalaHarris is female, you are male. #radicalizedmom and all women know we get shut down when we speak up.
Still She Persisted
And yet, women vote for Republicans. So very sad.
Shame on Burr for treating Harris differently than the male questioners yesterday
Thanks for defending Harris! That was outrageous misogyny on Burr's part.
Dems are badass Repugs are tRaitors
Men are taught to apologize for their weakness, women for their strength. She came to slay!
That was absolutely unacceptable.
Older white men, sorry - your days of being in charge of women are numbered at this point. Burr you're on very thin ice, tread lightly
Then why didn't you point this out publicly during the hearing, @RonWyden ?
#BurrMustRecuse We will find out his ties to Russia. #alevo
Women aren't allowed to speak intelligently in government. These old men are living in the Stone Age. #disgusting #deplorable
Nevertheless she persisted. Future #POTUS
Yup. #crustywhitemen hold very old ideas. Except for a very rare few (@SenSanders ). #BernieWouldHaveWon
Rosenstein tried to filibuster through her time without answering any questions. Painfully annoying to watch.
Thank you for pointing out the blatant sexism.  It's disappointing, but unfortunately, not surprising.  
Man-splaining 101, sit down woman and be respectful.......  #disgraceful

Thank you for pointing this out Sen. Wyden
Republican always fear strong women like #KamalaHarris
Thank you Senator Wyden! #persist #resist
Burr is rude & chauvinistic. 
Racist action by Burr.
Maybe he thought she was "uppity" and should "stay in her place".
Because if women are dogged in their efforts to find out the truth of a matter...well we can't have that, can we? #wonderwomen
Why doesn't anyone speak up and call out sexism as it happens?
Burr is sexist. That's why. Next issue?
Rock the boat Senator Harris! Let the paradigm shift.
Shame on them. Same old Repubs. Misogynists. Keep up the fight @SenKamalaHarris. Thanks also, @RonWyden.
Misogyny for the win! Thanks for your integrity. Gold Hill  you!
Certainly shows the need for the #ERA to be ratified once and for all!!!
Burr the American people are coming for you next & your seat will be replaced
I noticed that too. They were quite disrespectful of her persistent questioning. I hate to say it, but did her gender play a role?
You know it did. It's so ingrained he's not aware of it.
Typical of insecure men who fear strong,outspoken women who don't allow people to play games in a serious situation. More women in Senate
She wouldn't let her subject answer
Thank you
Thank you Senator Wyden. @RonWyden
Some men love interrupting women; at home or in the office. Showing their power over them at every opportunity makes some men feel important
#doublestandard #chauvanism
Thank you for acknowledging this!
Sen. Burr that was rude and uncalled for. You came across as trying to cover up for Trump. Don't interrupt Sen. Harris. We need answers.
.@senatorburr showed the world the sexism that exists in America with that move today on @SenKamalaHarris #repulsivemove
Oh trust me, I noticed
#NeverthelessShePersisted
#LetKamalaSpeak !
She also represents 4 times as many people as Burr and we want our questions answered.
Great job both of you the question was simple the answer was nothing
Because Burr is an asshole. We noticed. Shame on you.
In the 19th century, female authors used pseudonyms. In the 21st, we need holographic male avatars.
Burr needs to be dismissed from the room for a tantrum break.
There were no facts on the record only a lecture from another West Coast Politician. She lectured more than asked. As you did. Such a waste!
White men treats women bc theyre women ( gender) , w/ Sen Harris, she's a woman & the other obvious .....
Bravo!
She persisted and resisted! Good job, rookie!
The look she gave him--oooh!  He asked for it!  There is no going back after that.  Burr is done.
Shame on @SenatorBurr - he should know better. Sexism never looks good on ANYONE.
Thank you, yes. Women are very familiar with this one-upmanship. 
Correctile dysfunction
You're the best!! 
Nevertheless, she persisted. Keep strong, @SenKamalaHarris 
#resist We're with you Sen Kamala Harris!%
@yottapoint #boohoo. It's all partisan b.s. Anyway.
@SenatorBurr should be ashamed of himself. This is not the 1800's when women were seen but not heard. He's a pig.
#resist #sallyyatesisapatriot "No one is your friend who demands your silence" Alice Walker. 
Thank you Sen Wyden! Speak Truth!!
Why is there no sanction in the Senate for such blatant discrimination? (I mean, I know WHY, but there should be one.)
So obvious, they don't even pretend, so sad
We saw that. Kamala can hold her own (but should have backup) & she isn't to be trifled with. She's extremely smart, ambitious and honest.
#shepersisted
#ShePersisted @SenKamalaHarris
Thank you for pointing out this blatant misogyny. Real men see women as equals and speak out when they're not treated as such.
It was flabbergasting when she was attacked and then spoken down to like a child. Utterly ridiculous. Shame.
This was disturbing to watch...
Yep
Glad u noticed and commented
Sounds familiar. Women keep being told to sit down & be quiet by men. Keep at it @HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris @elizabethforma. @SenatorBurr
@SenatorBurr nope
Can I  this twice? #manterrupting
#DickBurr #asshole
Another warren moment/issues with tough ladies it appears
Thank you for your leadership!
#NeverthelessShePersisted
Brazen misogyny. Halfway expected him to end with "Little Lady." And exactly! No man who took a very hard line was interrupted. 
Contact information for Senator Richard Burr. Let him know his misogyny is showing and we don't appreciate it. 
https://www.burr.senate.gov/contact/office-locations ‚Ä¶
Thank you Senator! You're a good man!
Senator Burr needs to keep his disrespectful mouth shut. What is it with OLD GOP guys trying to shut women up?
And of course from great state of north bathroom control!
Is the GOP conspiring o cover up a crime?
My senator was going full prosecutor on Rosenstein and then got mansplained by the Chairman. #CAproud #persist
Burr needs to be more respectful
Thank you for recognizing this!!! Much respect sir!!
This sexist behavior is actually against the law, and has been for decades. I am aggravated by this. We will not stop fighting. Shame on GOP
Appears that @GOP doesn't seem to value it's female colleagues. Whether it's in the House or Senate. Burr/Harris  McConnell/Warren.
Thank you Senator Wyden. Many of us are outraged by the way Senator Harris was treated by Mr. Burr, Coates, Rogers, Rosenstein.
Mansplaining!
.@SenKamalaHarris will have the last laugh when she is 46
He is part of the he-man wimmen haterz club.  Disgraceful.
The voters think the time of the good old boy mentality is way overdue for an end in our government.
Why was a woman reprimanded for asking a reasonable question when men weren't? Republicans are afraid of letting women speak!
Yeah, that didn't go unnoticed by TV viewers either.
So proud you are my senator!
@SenatorBurr learned that move from Mitch. Someone said he  conducted classes on how to shut women up. Anything to support Trump
No respect for women
Disgraceful.
@senatorburr has proven to be a huge disappointment.  I had such faith in him at the beginning.  @SenKamalaHarris was doing the right thing.
This needs to be addressed. She was not treated fairly. Senator Warner too
Disgraceful how @SenatorBurr treated ONLY @SenKamalaHarris! Was like he felt he had to put a #women #inherplace but not interrupt the men!
I saw this and am still angry. Senator Burr, you owe a public apology and need to make sure it does not happen again by you or anyone else!
Unfortunately-I'm sure she's used to it-especially with the GOBs (Good Old Boys) in this Congress & Administration. 
She will persist!!
