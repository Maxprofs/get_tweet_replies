@SenSchumer Get ready Dem's to flip the seats of Republicans that Vote to do this. No one wants this that makes less than $100,000
@GOP @FLGovScott
@CNN @NBCLatino @MSNBC @ABCPolitics @NBCPolitics Should never have trusted GOP/ TRUMP!
@SenSchumer @YouTube there you go with fake news again. Tell the truth and try to do what's right for America. You are  the swamp
This is an outrage and needs exposure on front pages of national newspapers and prominent placement in TV and radio
@SenSchumer @YouTube I'm 68 years old; trust me Medicare at age 65 is a godsend for working people;
Thank you, Senator Wyden, for your efforts in protecting our retirement benefits, which we've paid for, by the way.
only people who work in offices think it's reasonable to work til 70- try farming til 70 and get back to us
@MarcVegan @RonWyden @YouTube Or law enforcement, or any other job where physical fitness is a necessity. WTF?
@SenSchumer @YouTube fake news, scare tactics,  we need term limits to do away with the like of you
Take Healthcare from these govt. Cretins and their families , see how fast the healthcare issue gets solved.
@SenSchumer @YouTube but they are saying it will save program
@SenSchumer @RonWyden as I recall it was the dimms that was saying that last year.
@SenSchumer Big corporations don't keep older workers. They are RIF'ed to make room for younger employees. My experience.
@DamonSilvers @YouTube I'm 61 and I do work in an office. They call me super woman; I'm not and I can't at this pace much longer
GOP has been salivatingover this for years. Less taxes for the rich. Vote McConnell & Ryan out. Impeach Trump!
you're listening to fake news. Get your facts right. Listen to Fox news not CNN.  CNN not for best for America
@SenSchumer @YouTube This is rich coming from the Dems who raided Medicare to fund the disaster Obamacare. #whyyoulost
@SenSchumer @YouTube Come on! 65 was selected in the 1800's! Avg life exp. 1900-50 was 48! 2000-50 projected 78! Obstructionist?
@SenSchumer @YouTube you didn't mind showing Obamacare dollar throat now look at it morons
@SenSchumer @YouTube Ron your a sleazy partisan hack that tells half truths. Raise the retirement age to 70 that's 20 year out!
Just Say No!
@SenSchumer If you guys dont get Trump, Pence & them out of office immediately, none of this will matter!! FOCUS!
Please don't let this man mess with what he doesn't understand.
@SenSchumer @YouTube no no
@SenSchumer @YouTube VOTE HIM OUT, VOTE HIM OUT
@SenSchumer @YouTube my plan retire at 62 it will open up jobs and boost the economy. Let people enjoy life
stop fighting for people who vote against you every time...it is the white class that will be hurt the most.  Stop it
@SenSchumer @YouTube A high percentage of my classmates still work at 70+. Nothing magic about 65 is there when so many are 
This will not go over for winning future elections.  It will show that TRUMP lied to the American people
@SenSchumer @YouTube it's not like the average mortality rate is less than 10 years after turning 70.
@SenSchumer @YouTube I am a conservative and I actually am against raising retirement age! We pay into social sec, don't touch it!
@SenSchumer @YouTube someone needs to dig into HIS closet...let's get rid of him too.
@SenSchumer @YouTube otherwise we go bankrupt. All the Dems fault we r in the position. Their tax and spend does not work.
@SenSchumer @YouTube only way to pay for the economic mess the dems put us in.
@SenSchumer @YouTube NO!!
why don't they put back the 3 TRILLION $+ they borrowed? Easy fix!!
if he did it would cost employers more oh wait no medical, benefits sorry had a brain fart...
pay back the trillions owed
Medicare and SSI is our money. We worked for it.
.@RonWyden Another horrible human being from deep within the swamp #saynotomulvaney
WOW! You continue using bogus scare tactics....give it up we are on to you!
@EricShapiro3 @YouTube people who loose  job in their 50â€™s never get equivalent. We need to open up Medicare for them. Start there
Disservice to those who put Trump in office. #Resist
You are lying about this!
thank you, we have paid into these programs for decades to have a decent retirement, without them we may never get there
70 doesn't sound unreasonable as life expectancy has risen
I don't think the body can last until 70, some professions are very demanding on the body.
70? Who can do manual labor till 70? Companies want to get rid of anyone over55 as it is
If it's such a good idea, let them do it.  Remind 'em. Out @ 70.  No SS or Medicare.
Absolutely unacceptable!  Keep fighting!
Not only is this potentially catastrophic for seniors but also limits employment options for young people. Stupid idea!
also will cause number of disability claims to skyrocket as dis pays full amount rather than very reduced bens at age 62
They keep moving the goalpost instead of shoring up the benefit.
@VernBuchanan @marcorubio Please do not support Mulvaney.  He will hurt millions of Americans.
They'll approve him. Speaker Ryan wants to do the same thing.
OMG. This is a REPUB IDEA FOLKS! They have wanted this for yrs! GOP would rather you die before getting YOUR OWN ENTITLED Soc Sec!
Institutions don't even want u 2 work 2 that age. Seen ppl who have worked 2 that age n beyond it is not a pretty sight.
So what's your answer to SSI running out of money because government has spent all of it, as well as put us 17 Trillion in debt!!
How 'bout we just do it for people who pull in $100K+ in salary & investment income. In fact, everyone, not just elders.
how is this a good idea for anyone but the wealthy ?
Unacceptable for RETIRED Americans who have stopped working due to health issues in their 60s.
please tell me there are some republicans that will stand against this
Who is going to hire me at that age? I paid into the Medicare system. It's just not right.
