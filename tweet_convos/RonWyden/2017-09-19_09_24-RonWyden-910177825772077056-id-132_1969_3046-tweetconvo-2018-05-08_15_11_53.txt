Hej
Thank you @RonWyden - we appreciate it! #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
If this Republican bill passes, people will die. No exaggeration.
What a lie. Shame on you
Guess Dr.Cassidy forgot the part of his oath that stated, DO NO HARM!
Do no harm? Oh, that explains it. He thought it was "do no ham"
Taking care of yourself---paying your own way is hardly Draconian....
Health care and insurance can be too expensive for very sick people, many of whom are poor. Other major countries take care of their own.
Listen genius-We absolutely are ethically obligated to care for those who CAN NOT care for them selves  BUT NOT those who DO NOT. SIMPLE
I don't believe you sincerely think I'm a genius. You're being rude, and I wasn't rude to you. I shouldn't be shocked. You lack empathy.
Academically--Try a different approach and see things differently.  Base assessments on demonstrable FACTS not feelings or thoughts.
It's 12:24 in the afternoon on a tuesday???
I think Mr. Cassidy needs to me injected with West Nile and left to die.
The ones of us for repeal and replace work.
How many times are they going to try to do this
I can't believe the GOP killed the bi partisan Murry-Alexander bill!  We want bi partisan cooperation.  NO to the Graham - Cassidy bill!
I hate term Trumpcare! Should a cheating illegitimate Prez get 2 stake claim 2 anything I hv t deal w in t future? NO! He is an interloper!
Please STOP the hype!   Work well with others.  You used to when you were junior.
Thank you from Florida
What is the Tenn. Sen. Working on? He is working with Dems. the way it should be done. H.C. is not a Political issue. It is a Human Issue.
Thanks for fighting for us, Senator Wyden!
I'm with you in spirit! Give 'me hell!
They need to take the terms "health" and "care" out of the entire bill, and all references to it.  They do not apply.
That's good!
Any senator who is FOR this legislation is unfit to make decisions as a representative of US citizens!  CALL YOUR SENATORS
I have been calling congress texting and fighting for this for a long time. I have Tri care for life. Fighting for Trumps chumps is HARD!!!
A bill called #GrahamCassidy  is not magically turned into another named bill that has never existed. Socialism Sucks. Move to Venezuela
Death care DJT ins is murder
Ron: G-C is truly bad. Here is an aspect of its badness you may have missed but could help publicize: https://niskanencenter.org/blog/health-care-decentralization/ â€¦ (From an X-OR)
What is more "draconian" than requiring people to PAY in order to NOT carry health insurance?
Yes!! @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @SenJohnMcCain @SenSusanCollins

I loath the Koch brothers!
#TrumpCare
Dude your a goofball!
Alright, but why aren't you supporting the single payer health care bill Sanders is putting forth?
Can we deficate the money for this ?
Draconian?  Not sure word even applies to healthcare but at the least a great use of hyperbole.
Power of the People #democracy
You mean illegals. No American will vote democrat again
I am with them in spirit
Get over yourself, puppet, and get to work.
I say NOOOOOO
Still a disability
I chose not to fight SSD after denial due to amount. At 62 I will apply so I can get somewhat more than they wanted to give me!
One shot every 2 weeks cost over $4000.00 if no insurance and that is not the only medication I take. DISCRIMINATION!
I assume most of the 1% own major stock in medical insurance, medical suppliers, RX stock etc. Their reason to push this vile agenda.
Absolutely! What an ugly world we have become!
If this passes, the @gop in mass should be charged with crimes against humanity.
We will not turn back the clock! I have Ulcerative colitis Pancolitis with Eroding Colon with complications! I take Humira
@LindseyGrahamSC make no mistake, American consumers will not forget #VoteNOGrahamCassidy profiteering off sick BOO!! #MedicareForAll
#VoteNOGrahamCassidy  unbelievably cruel, throw ppl off healthcare #McConnellGreed 1% get tax breaks #MedicareForAll #SB562 #HR676 #Revolt
Once you say #draconian you're reciting from the talking points and you have no credibility.
#KOCH #Trumpcare
Thank you Senator Wyden

Graham explained on tv that it's better for each state to control our medical care, he forgot to tell us that states don't have the money.
#HostageVideo #Trumpcare #KOCH
It won't pass. Passing the responsibility to States with the burden. Putting the average people in harm's way
Are you sure it won't pass?
@NancyPelosi @SenKamalaHarris @SenSchumer FIGHT/RESIST WITH US NOW!
They're really calling it #TheGrandChastityBill
Taking away health care of people who don't vote has zero consequences


It's Obamacare lite stop the hysteria and do your job.
#GrahamCassidy is #SkinnyRepeal is #CassidyGraham is #SkinnyRepeal is #CassidyGraham is #SkinnyRepeal says #TheResistance
Trumpcare is inhumane and criminal.
Thank you!
you sound like a crybaby.
Please keep up the fight to rid the American people of this RIDICULOUS bill masquerading as HEALTHCARE. Thank you Senator for your reason!

We'll be paying for his healthcare alright but he'll be in prison!! HAHAHA
#TrumpCare #GrahamCassidy
How about not trump care, or Obama care. But America care. Maybe then USA can accomplish something. The old already PD there medicare dues.
Thanks to all being there protesting this outrageous "health plan"! Wish I could be there with you! Thanks #Resistance
Are there any demonstrations in FAVOR  of TrumpCare and all its morph versions?
We should regulate the pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies from price gouging.
This would lower the cost.
It started in Albany Oregon.....go get em, Ron!
How many times do Americans need to say this?!!! The republicans are VILE
Oh look @realDonaldTrump This crowd is WAY larger than yesterday's Trump supporters crowd! 
Go
#TrumpCare #GrahamCassidy
We still want universal health care
This is what Democracy looks like!!
The people want #Medicare4All
Need JIMMY KIMMEL!!
Thank-you for fighting against those who clearly believe that health care is a privilege, not a right in the lives of ALL Americans.
I see some of my Re-"Sisters" in the crowd! Wish I were there with you!
#Resistance #GrahamCassidyBill SUCKS! 
Liar. You spread false information to gullible people. Go back to New York.
Amen





















Reminds me of that gang of rabies-infected mutants from "I Am Legend"









Thank you!


You created this mess. #RepealObamacare





TRICKLE down
GOP,  vote for Cassidy/ Graham version of TrumpCare in 2017. We vote you PUT in 2018. You must support those who need hralthcare.




#Resist Cassidy/Graham version of #Trumpcare
Gee which taxes your defending because we know it's not healthcare for the serfs.

Good job Ron Wyden...keep it going!
@LindseyGrahamSC please hear the message SC and the nation are sending to you. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
He's toast- next election.
They are not. Obamacare and welfare are putting people through hell every damn day.
