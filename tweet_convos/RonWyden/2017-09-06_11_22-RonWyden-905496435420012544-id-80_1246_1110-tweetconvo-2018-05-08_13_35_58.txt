Back to Oregon – this is a wildfire engulfing our beautiful Columbia River Gorge Monday night #EagleCreekFire
I wrote the president yesterday urging him to include a wildfire funding fix in any disaster aid request. #EagleCreekFire
This fix makes sure we treat wildfires like the natural disasters they are. It's a must to maintain $$ for prevention & for fighting fires.
I urge you @realDonaldTrump, do not ignore the West.
I will keep pushing the president & Congress to fix our backward system of funding wildfires.
Senators u should have used ur $$ more wisely instead of providing for illegal immig. & sanctuary cities now Amer. will suffer at ur hands!!
fires burning, lands flooding, extreme storms, hurricane winds, apocalyptic--
Shit baby, are you there? Are you there?!
And........
Did you forget Northern Manitoba?
For a us politician, North America stops at the 49th parallel ;)
Oh yea. Oops.
Climate change is a reality & we need the CC deniers to wake up &  stop lying to themselves & voters. We still have time to reverse disaster
Yup.  Global warming has been at it for decades.  Where have ya'all been?  Heads buried in the sand...?
It's snowing ash here. I'm not letting my dog out.
and you're a failure! Get your ass out here and order aircraft to put fire out instead of rural fire dept OVERTIME scam. 3/4mi vis
@MyraDSirois1 @usnews  sent to the country!
Arizona too
OMG
Mother earth is pissed off #ClimateChangeIsReal
Do I spy a bit of misandry here?  Why not father earth?
It's horrible.  Not burning in Boise proper, but we're sure getting the smoke.  Can't see 1/4 mile. 98 deg. My bronchitis is not happy.  
Heartbreaking to say the least. The fires caused by humans, horrifying.
Family members around Seattle are going to work & school wearing dust masks so they can breath.  "Fire & fury like the world has yet to see"
From the mouth of what I believe is truly Satan's spawn.
In CA, it seems our worst fire season has been Aug-October for years now. [Note: I am NOT denying climate change].
I'm on OR coast and its hazy, smoky here. My sincere thoughts and prayers to those fighting these wretched fires and those in their path.
And living in smoke is not good :/
My eyes burn, I need an inhaler, the sun looks red thru the smokey clouds, plus its snowing ash...  kinda sketchy 
Has anyone had a conversation with a former Global Warming Denier who has seen the light? I just would like to hear what they say
Hurricanes to the south... It's not nice to fool Mother Nature, ClimateDeniars!

Don't be the sign lady... #resist clip art

I kid. Multiple scenario world apocalypse thing > Russian hackers electric grid & Nuclear NK > Hurricanes in the East and fire in the West
Good that you noticed.
Forgot to mention BC which has been generating smoke in all of the PNW this summer. Cross-border problem@
In lieu of this breaking development are you still advocating for the Jordan Cove LNG export refinery and pipeline? #KeepItInTheGround Ron
Husband and I live in Houston (and just survived Harvey) but we hail from California/Idaho and Oregon. Houston is ok y'all. Focus on fires!!
Pray, Dance, Meditate, Wish, Weep, & Ask for Rain. Do it til it's done. #wildfires
I'm in The Dalles and the air quality is really terrible. Please,stay indoors if you can.
YOU can do something about this. It's literally your job.
Ron.... still think the FEDS controlling 53% of Oregon is a good idea? Shame on you and the USFS/ BLM for disgraceful mismanagement!!!!
Climate change is like an Illuminati apocalypse: earth (quakes) from fracking, fire across the west, wind and water from hurricanes.
And, hello? FYI people, we can smell the fires all the way up here in Seattle, and we have ash falling here from the fires for 2 days now.
it's so smoky here I am stuck indoors. We are hundreds of miles away from the fires.
Washington is suppos s to be the wettest state in the Union. But it's not climate change. It's the gays fault. Jesus
Aside from a narrow strip along the coast, Washington is far from the wettest state. The dryest parts of Florida are wetter than most of WA
I stand corrected!!  Thanks for pointing out my ignorance. I just learned that Louisiana is the wettest. I learned a couple new things today
Gosh!  What did the GOP do to cause this?!
Feel better?
Why not! The Dems would rather blame than legislate!
Oh that's rich.  Carry on then.
Thanks!
It's fucking hot enough already as it is. Why can't these land owners keep their lands from burning? Jesus Christ, summer isn't over yet.
Yet the POTUS is talking about lowering taxes for the top 1% and corporate taxes.
The air is unhealthy to breathe in many places now.
This from a guy who lives in New York.  Tweeted like he really cares....
And no national news coverage, people getting sick, losing homes, and no tankers flying!
Let's see if you & @JeffMerkley are as inefficient at getting "Wild-Fire" aid from the Congress, as anything else the 2 of you do!
BUSTED!
And to think, all those EPA restrictions against the timber industry led to mismanaged forests resulting in our current situation.
Portland wants to see those young men from Washington prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law! Get on it Ron!
OMG it does feel like apocalyptic times-floods, fires, tyrants. 
Yeah, and water is wet. Next you will be saying the sky is blue. #liberalsAreNuts #turnORred #Ny3rdSenator #notMySenator
Steve you're a sad little man with no point to make. Go yell at your neighbor kids. #offmylawn
Maybe fire up that HAARP and send some rain. There's ash all over my car, the sun looks jacked up, and the moon is blood orange. Thanks.
Western Canada (BC) is burning too
The #ClimateChange War has begun, whether America believes in or not
Cue @JerryFalwellJr , @LibertyU , andJimBakkerShow to blame it the gays in 3...2...
Truth is, United States is facing #climate catastrophes "From Sea to Shining Sea" http://getenergysmartnow.com/2017/09/04/climate-catastrophes-striking-from-sea-to-shining-sea/ … "The West is Burning" part of this
Me landing in Medford. Maybe we should have paid for the 747 super tanker?
I'm in California.. no fire here... stop being melodramatic
Muted this guy for good reason. Here's his argument:
I live 30 miles east of cascade locks & the air quality has been horrible. Sports canceled and asked to stay indoors.
Don't you want to take this opportunity to blame Trump for the fires Ron? climate change? Identity politics, it's what you do. #TermLimits
PDX's climate is NOTHING like it was when I was a kid in the 70s & 80s. Anyone who's lived here all their life knows CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.
And what federal help are these states getting? And nothing, really, being reported on it nationally... :\
As a Harvey survivor, it pisses me off that media won't talk about the fires. The PNW is my homeland. Houston is 90% ok. PNW is not
Montana has been all but destroyed and no one even seemed to notice.  We need help, too! We've just been totally ignored by gov and media.
and DC does not even care. the national media does not care.
Living in the haze of thick smoke in WA too. We have air warnings & decreased visibility.
Living in Beaverton and spending lots of time in the gorge on weekends it breaks my heart to see the beautiful Columbia Gorge burning. 
Raining ash in Seattle for first time since St Helen eruption in 1980
Funding climate change action would help; the PNW wasn't always so dry!
If it doesn't benefit .ru, give tax cuts to billionaires, empower nazis, or hurt LGBTQI or nonwhite people, @realDonaldTrump doesn't care.
@realDonaldTrump needs to wake up. It's not just hurricanes!
Hurricanes fires floods drug epidemic threat of nuclear war we need to get our houses inorder because all the signs are amongst us. 
Pray
Maybe if you would allow some clearing and harvesting this would not be as bad
Mother Nature wants her planet back. Not going to ask us twice.

and British Columbia.
But you still won't introduce permaculture design repair for earth
and America is broken.
why is this phenomenon happening on a continuous basis??? these disasters are preventable with forest management.
An no real coverage on it at all on national news smh

#oregonfires #OregonFire skies over NE Portland

I don't think I've ever felt the dying of the world more viscerally 
Northwest Washington

Because people like you @RonWyden are not allowing Sustained logging on federal land.
Agreed, they must get rid of the old and dying trees.
