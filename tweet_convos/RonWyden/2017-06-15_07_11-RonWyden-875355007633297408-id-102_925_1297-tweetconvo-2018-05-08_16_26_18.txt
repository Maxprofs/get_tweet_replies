If you haven't seen the bill How Do You know. Speculation and assumption makes We The People hate your agenda and frankly we know Deep State
Your part is dangerous and very obvious . We The People are coming for your job. It is just we need to investigate you. Same disrespect.
Nope just making a point he can be replaced reelection why would I threaten anyone I don't know. 1st amendment but you threatening me son.
Too bad we in Oregon who vote for Ron Wyden LOVE him. Good luck influencing us from Texas. 
Share real stories of families who'd be impacted by #AHCA to make a difference! My child's life in danger
How do you know Ron- do you have secret recorders in the closed room or are you part of the leakers?
He saw it plus CBO score. Do try to keep up and thanks for playing.
And especially "whatever you do, don't get REALLY sick."
GOP #AHCA will cost Seniors on #Medicare an extra $38k ($43k for women) over lifetime. #ACA #TrumpCare #AARP #Medicare2kTax
Citizen: Need a gun 
GOP:  Okay.  
Citizen: Need health plan.  
GOP:  Whoa fella you don't want that.  Meanwhile, do you want a gun?
Smart idea. Guns are a right. Healthcare is not.
So, if you injure yourself with a gun, then we should let you just die without any help? You have no right to it?
Are we getting lost in the hyperbolic or is "right to die" becoming part of this discussion?  Asking for a friend.
Wear garlic around our necks and carry a silver cross, amen.
Right. People that are already sick will die. I stopped calling it Trumpcare. It is TrumpTaxCut for the rich. Bankrupt treasury too.
GOP health care plan=Walk it off
Maybe they'll take away my Insurance THREE times like Barry did?
Look at the numbers. Obamacare is losing ground fast. What about the families when it does? #MAGA
Too late. My daughter's MS infusions are twice a year, at $32,500 each. That's $65,000/year for two infusions. And I'm a cancer survivor.
That sounds about right don't get sick because we don't have anything to help u we spent all  money on giving tax cuts to the billionaires
That's a huge take away. So, even the people who are insured through work get screwed. Wow the @GOP didn't miss a trick did they? #Trumpcare
Don't get old and don't get sick - the new motto of trump care!  SAD!! @realDonaldTrump
Unacceptable. If they depended on it, the bill would be much different. They would cover themselves. Right @GOP ? Greedy & sneaky.
How can you complain about health care bill being secret and then gripe about all the bad things in it?  Hypocrite.
@jmichaelkell and if you're already sick .. die.
It's too late for me for that plan.   What's plan B under Trumpcare?  suicide?  move to New Zealand?
Or pregnant. Or old.
Or maybe - stop buying worthless garbage because it's shiny, so you can afford to Buy you own healthcare.
@TopherSpiro Please do whatever you can to stop this devastating 'health care' plan from being approved.
How different would government health care be if you and your colleagues were only offered this version? Thanks for taking care of us!
Are you trying to get more people shot. Call out players, stop blindly blaming HOP! Dems are the shooters
My decision to get a replacement battery for my pacemaker will depend on my savings & availability of health insurance in 2027 at age 63.
The original PM cost S100k of which half was for one medication I needed for less than 24 hours. My out of pocket cost with insur was $2500.
...and if you do get sick, DIE FAST and save the insurers' $$$. 
The GOP health plan will likely kill me. Why must I die for tax cuts for the rich?
Like obama care, and give me all your money.
"... and if you do, die quickly" 
Will always love @AlanGrayson for that line
and if you do get sick, die quickly."
@AlanGrayson
Also, don't get shot.
This constituent of yours with preexisting conditions appreciates your hard work on this.  Please continue to push for transparency.
Exactly like the #ACA then.
We urge you @WydenPress to have the Democrats withhold consent until the Senate plan is released and opened up for debate. THEN VOTE NO!
Don't get shot either! Americans won't be able to afford treatment for accidents & tragedies that include that & car wrecks, home accidents.
Smart plan. Eat right and exercise so slimy senators can't politicize your health!
will they (the waltons & walmart) raise wages to take the TAX burden off State & Fed govs for this assistance?
the waltons receive HUGE tax breaks- every walmart receives up to a MIL$ PER STORE in food, rent & health assistance for employees low wages
ppl who have nothing 2 hide, hide nothing.  GOP need 2 commit 2 bipartisan bill. Dems start talking fixes, Get on tv TALK Fixes
AND it is still bottom line a Finance Plan For HUGEST EVER TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH.

disgrace sir you complain and belittle and do and offer nothing to work together where is your out reach where is your humility reach out
"......and if you get sick, die quickly." - Alan Grayson
A mirror of OBUMMERCARE
Th DemonRats make me sick !!! 
Imagine that? Growing older in the USA would not be a good thing.
Where did you see that, i keep hearing that republicans not showing bill
Ron supported OBAMACARE & Oregon's COVEROREGON & Oregon's ONE. All Failure$ that have $quandered Billion$ & Ron keeps on Lying!
No not ALL Americans. Re-read your survey "study". And if you don't like the plan stop "resisting" and start making things better.
GOP need to understand that taking away one's ACA after having it for the first time will be A HUG HUG MISS STAKE ON THEIR PART.HUG PROBLEM
If you dont know whats in it, how can you make the statments you are making
Maybe the tragic shootings yesterday will illustrate to the GOP that one cannot plan not to need medical care.
It's all about covering only aspirin & bandaids.
And if you do, we will just everyone else pay for what you can't.
@TopherSpiro @axios please tell me if limits are amounts billed by docs and hospitals or amounts paid by insurer. Very different.
Lifetime caps are death sentences.
And if you do get sick, die quickly.
GOP: thank u 4 taking away BASIC care
4 paying more $ 4 less
4 making it cheaper to DIE than seek care
Compassion not in GOP vocabulary 
Guns = a right. Healthcare = a privilege.
@SenateDems @TopherSpiro No. It amounts to: you get nothing=die quicker=less people on Medicaid/care=LOOK HOW CHEAP HEALTHCARE IS!
@SenateDems @TopherSpiro @axios that's what it amounts for me now. As my deductible is to high for middle class
Always worked for me..I was on Native American plan. Do a little song, do a dance, say a prayer, put something in peace pipe..good medicine.
You don't even know what the plan is...
Plan is a three step process: 1 ER. 2 Bankruptcy. 3 Go fund me.
Call it #DeathByGOP which is what it is
Thankyou for your contribution to the demise of the Republic, you puke.
Congress should have to have exact same coverage
Alan Grayson was right on this one. 100 percent.
Those of us on Individual plans pay $17K per year before we can even see Dr. Employers get a discount, we make it up
Or shot
ACA for me "amounts to get sick ...pay $17K first before you make an appointment'"
Amounts to murder
Left drama
@CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez NJ is watching!  No to limits!
Please keep fighting for us! No wonder the "plan" is so secret
Hell of a New York senator you are....
Obamacare is taking people's homes away.  Its either pay the mortgage or pay the premiums.
We need a real healthcare sltn now. My RX alone = 6k/mo. D/n incl doc visits, flare tx, hosp, surgeries. Benefit cap = shorter, sicker life.
Please continue to work to support ACA and fight this harmful plan. Much  & support from rural Eastern Oregon.
It's not an 'idea'.It determines if many Americans live or die.A power no democratic gvmnt should have PS, @SenateGOP @HouseGOP chose death
You'll die under Obamacare.  It's broke.  Do you tell people that you are exempt from Obamacare? Bet not.
This bill will harm countless families in many ways.  There is no way anyone making minimum wages will survive an injury or disease.
And don't get old
and "don't have emergencies"
I'm urging Dems to now focus on healthcare please only and not Russia (for now)
New Analysis Finds Uninsured Rate for Kids Would Increase by 50% Under AHCA https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2017/06/14/new-analysis-finds-uninsured-rate-for-kids-would-increase-by-50-under-ahca/ …

No it doesn't and it's this type of fear mongering and ignorant, duplicitous rhetoric that gets people shot, .@RonWyden.
#TrumpCare
This is just an excuse. They want "no healthcare". Repeal the ACA and replace with nothing. Reward the rich.
