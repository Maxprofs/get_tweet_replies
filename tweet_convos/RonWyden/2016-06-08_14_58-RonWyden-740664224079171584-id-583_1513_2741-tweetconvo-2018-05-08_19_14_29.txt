@SenWarren Not a legal requirement to become president, get over it!
Neither are Speech Transcripts @SherriWilkie @RonWyden @SenWarren
if you think it's ok for her to take $ for speeches and Clinton Foundation then use her position @RonWyden @SenWarren
but the tax returns show how you made your money. Why wouldn't you want tax returns released?
What the hell do tax returns tell me? He's rich. I already knew that.
tells us a candidateâ€™s finances, charitable giving, investments and tax rate-transparency
Again, it already tells me he's rich.
if that's all you're looking for. Trust there is a reason that he won't release them.
@SenWarren I don't want to see them.  I just want strength!  I want a prez who draws a line & means it! @realDonaldTrump will!

LIZ: nothing U say abt him equal 2 your support of torture of disabled in your state, honey! So sit down.

I'm sorry.  It seems I'm still learning on Twitter and different devices. Plus I need new glasses.

@SenWarren #ReleaseTheTranscripts don't you want to hear @HillaryClinton harsh talk to @GoldmanSachs
I do
Is that what you do when someone doesn't post in your favor?
Weird 
We want the transcripts if you force Bernie out.  NO transcripts no votes. #BringClintonToHeel #GoGetHerComey
@MykaNecohl I own a rental property, make 20k a year positive cash flow,it can look like I lose money on it with depreciation etc.
@RonWyden@RonWyden sorry but we don't care about the returns- much more concerned about terrorist/
Security
@SenWarren and Emails
lets start with Hillary's emails. I think that's a better idea. @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren
well @HillaryClinton takes major money from Saudi Arabians that want to kill the LGBT Community?U want to talk about that?
@SenWarren releasing biggest bankers speech transcripts would be great also #ReleaseTheTranscripts
@SenWarren @absolutely47 You won't vote for Trump anyway, so he doesn't care what you think.  Our Votes will speak! #TrumpTrain
@SenWarren All that is legally required to be released by candidates are financial statements. Sorry.
@SenWarren No one cares about bullshit tax returns #idiot
@SenWarren - they want all of Hillarys emails which is more important but then you won't call that out
@SenWarren #DNCLeaks #DNCLeaks #DNCLeaks
the people of Oregon elected u ? Wow
No law requires it. Best look in @HillaryClinton's closet. I hear she's got a few skeletons!
@SenWarren But transcripts aren't important when speaking to Goldman Sachs.That's why I don't care what @HillaryClinton said for $
@SenWarren Your candidate is the most corrupt women in american and you're worried about tax returns lmao JOKE!
@SenWarren #RELEASETHETRANSCRIPTS
@SenWarren Isn't it great when politicians tell us what "a majority of Americans want" when it's tax returns but not transcripts?
@SenWarren but where are the 30k+ emails??
lol no one cares about emails or 4 people dead from Benghazi , bush killed millions and destroyed middle east
What does any of this have to do with Bush?? The only candidate that isn't intertwined with these crooked
@SenWarren Release the email prosecute violations of the federal records act.
#hillary2016
@hillaryclinton @realDonaldTrump Mr. Real guy how about your TAXES?
@SenWarren Did you get your Bonus Check from the Foundation too?
Endorsing your opponent that is total opposite to your values must have come with a hefty price tag.
- Actually, we Americans don't care.  H donated 4.3 Million to a "charity".  Wait, it was to her own CF - deductible!
Breach of Trust Bernie's Foot-Dragging on Tax Returns
Raises Serious Concerns
@SenWarren release the deleted emails
So release it you paid shill.
So why wouldn't #Bernie release his. His unsigned, incomplete 2014 return didn't count. What was he hiding?
you're kidding right? You know his net worth compared to your God right? Whether you're Shillary or Trump, you lose
We know #Bernie/Jane r millionaire owners of 3 homes, pay 13% tax, invest heavy on WallSt & hve govt pensions 4 life
lmao, you are delusional. That is a lie. You should do your research before you spread lies that make you look stupid
Clinton Foundation did not disclose donors. Fernwood gave $1m in 2009 to CGSI in Canada, transferred to Clinton Foundation in NY.
And the transcripts of their #WallStreet speeches. #ReleaseTheTranscripts
@SenWarren If there was anything illegal IRS would have prosecuted. Otherwise they're irrelevant.
@SenWarren But liberals, drinking from the #progressive spittoon lie continually. #Lieawatha.
@SherriWilkie Sherri, why do you defend Trump not releasing his taxes? Would u say the say if this was Hillary? I highly doubt it
As a matter of fact I would. However, I would be interested in seeing Clinton Foundation records.
@SenWarren neither do ethnic backgrounds she lied about being 1/100000 Indian to get a job. She's from the slapahoe tribe
@senwarren << 2radical homosexuals

speech transcripts also give our a lot of information about a candidate too .
@SenWarren speech transcripts also give our a lot of information about a candidate too .
@SenWarren Let's see your Harvard application. And take that DNA test then you get Trumps returns.
@SenWarren so do speech manuscripts.
Yet, when @BernieSanders wanted @HillaryClinton to #ReleaseTheTranscripts from Goldman Sachs, where were you then, @SenWarren ?!?
@SenWarren Lets #ReleasetheTranscripts while we're at it.
w/ the "right" accountant and lax morals, tax returns can say anything you want them to. Ask the Clintons.
that's why Hillary has offshore shell corporations corporations  @SenWarren
@SenWarren Warren your a peace of shit and wyden if you want to follow down that path your vote is coming . I'm from Oregon

@SenWarren The same goes for speech transcripts.
You are so right! Returns can't lie and #dishonestDonald can't tell the truth! He's got #greedylittlehands
@SenWarren They also want to know why the money HRC raised to help down ticket candidates ended up in her coffers.
@SenWarren they also want to have transcripts of speeches by presidential candidates who netted hundreds of thousands from banks.
@SenWarren Everything STAGED with you pathetic idiots. IRS monitors everyone's tax return each year!!!! Let them do their jobs!
@SenWarren who cares, not relevant
@SenWarren I wonder what Trump is hiding. And I'm not referring to his hair plugs.
@SenWarren MrTrump should tell you what Elizabeth Warren always say while she hittin that Booz bottle every night Go Duck Yourself
@SenWarren Tax returns are not &never was a requirement 2run 4president TRUMP Rights not 2release why should he liberal spin&twist
I think they are equally concerned with Clinton's emails and transcripts. Perhaps address Election fraud,as that's rather telling
@HillaryClinton has convinced everyone that taxes mean nothing about whether someone is ethical. #ReleaseTheTranscripts
@SenWarren - Well Ron Judging how the IRS SPINS BIAS all on its own why trust their judgement on ANY conservatives tax return?
@SenWarren majority of Americans? Another made up statement.

@SenWarren he also want them to #ReleaseTheTranscripts  when they give speeches for over $250.k plus
@SenWarren an actual subpoena asked hrc to turn over state dept emails, and instead she deleted them=unable to be president.
@SenWarren a majority of Americans wanted Obama to release his sealed docs and hrc's wall st speeches. When did that happen?
@SenWarren #ReleaseTheTranscripts
@SenWarren but its not law and uve never hd multi billionaire job provider running 4 office IRS wldve indicted Trump eons ago
@RonWyden
@SenWarren Assuming you are getting @HillaryClinton to do this, could you also ask her for speech transcripts/fees? #BernieOrBust
@pudcast245 and you'll release yours (and Nancy's) too, Senator?  I'm sure Steve Novak will release his!
Love to see those tax returns, Ron. Also the audited body count of the 500,000 women & kids killed by Hillary's vote for Iraq war.
@LisaTucc Yeah, but Hillary big bucks transcripts to Goldman Sach, no release needed due to hypocritical position she now has.
@SenWarren Lame attacks, but Hillary's criminal history untouched. Time for justice!
@SenWarren love Elizabeth Warren, got my vote
Hello Mitt Romney, now this is what is heartbreaking, not a Trump candidacy.
@SenWarren sellout! U screwed @BernieSanders - u lose!
@SenWarren
They can't?
That's an idiotic statement
Of course tax returns can lie
that's why the IRS does audits!
@SenWarren Has Clinton released her transcripts or was the money just her driving up in the limo to get from Goldman Sachs?
.@RonWyden @SenWarren transcripts can't lie either...
@SenWarren I want to know how to properly address you- is it Pocahontas or LIE-A-WHATA?
@SenWarren No law or rule says that tax returns must be turned over, This is a fraud, A hillary fruad! We say no Trump, Dont do so
@SenWarren Ron, you are trying to manipulate. His tax return is none of your, or any ones business. Shut up.
@Thom_Hartmann actually...
American public doesn't give a shit about tax returns - politicians & media just want them as ammo to create bogus controversies!
Have you seen our tax code? Only lawyers/accountants understand it so politicians & media try to manufacture controversies!  #scum
@Thom_Hartmann Yes, Bernie release them!
@Thom_Hartmann Progressives also want Clinton to release Wall Street Speeches & TPP e-mails. @SenSanders
@SenWarren tax returns tell nothing. If the Irs is okay with why do you care?
We have yet to see two candidates returns
@SenWarren Neither do Wall Street speech transcripts. But politicians do, in fact, lie. Right, Liz?
@SenWarren what are Trump's tax returns going to say? Rich guy who pays less in taxes than me. The tax system is the problem
@SenWarren Seriously you think Tax returns can't lie?  how simple and naive
@SenWarren Know what else can't lie? Transcripts of speeches to Wall Street brokerages. I don't have a party, I have principles.
my bet is the returns will show a fraud and a phony, why else hide?
@SenWarren  NINNYS THE BOTH OF'VE YOU- ugh
@SenWarren Hillary Clinton also should release the transcripts of her enormously paid speeches.
#ReleaseTheTranscripts
