How thoroughly and predictably tacky 
Happy Impeachment! Now THAT would make Christmas merry 
What was tacky?
Oh well let's start with crass over-the-top ostentation while Americans in Puerto Rico still have no power, perhaps?
Nope, and nope.
But i'll get on the case of *anyone* who flaunts rank hypocrisy.
@LadyHellsBells  I'm sure you turned off your power & water sources at your home in honor of PR, right?  Maybe fasting too?
IF... i were leader of a government overseeing a US territory devastated by natural causes, i'd damn sure have looked after their basic fundamental safety, medical and nutritional needs 2 months later, before pulling a tactless publicity stunt like this.
Looks like tax dollars spent wisely. Not.
The nativity was worth every penny
You know the nativity has been there since 1967...
Yes with a few years of exceptions
Nope every year since 1967
Thank you @FLOTUS  for sharing. It looks absolutely amazing.  Took my breath away.  Thank you so much  for bringing back class and  elegance and most of all the nativity scene. 
God bless you @POTUS  and @FLOTUS  and your family. Merry Christmas.
Beautiful! Love the nativity set. Merry Christmas.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
SO BEAUTIFUL!  We need to be reminded of the beauty of Life, of God, of ourselves and one another.  God bless us, every one, with the eyes to see the Grace and gifts raining upon us every moment of every day  Merry Christmas! and thank you Potus & Flotus for all your effort!
joli!!!! kiss
Absolutely stunning! So proud to have you as our First Lady!
Very nice. Merry Christmas. Okay haters what now??? @maddow
Merry Christmas to you!  Elegant and tastefully done.

It’s absolutely stunning and beautiful. Don’t listen to the spiteful haters. They have hate running through their veins and spew venom...but, ironically, still follow your posts. Ban the bitches! 
Absolutely gorgeous!!
To those leaving nasty comments: you’re revealing the nasty hate in your soul. If you don’t like something, move along. If you don’t have something nice to say, keep your mouth shut.
Trump works hard for us, he does pray every nite , u people need to get a life,
Breathtaking!
beautiful
Merry Christmas Melania. Be Blessed and The Decorations are Beautiful.
So wish i could visit and take my son. It’s the first time in his life I’ve been truly proud of our @potus @flotus
Absolutely Beautiful! Thank you for taking time to share with us! 
Beautiful! Thanks for sharing.
Disgusting way of spending money. People are starving in your country.
I hope & pray that it will be a celebration of your horrid husband's, & his equally evil administration's, exit from our lives. You all brought such darkness to all of us. Please get out of our lives by December 25th. Only then can there be true festivities. #MerryChristmas(?)
I can see you are a very I'll person, get well soon.
Yes I'm a very "I'll" person.
*ill. I'm going to correct it for you because I'm sure you couldn't figure it out for yourself. Ha ha. Be well.
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS VERY GORGEOUS FIRST LADY AND TO YOUR WHOLE FAMILY! THIS AMERICAN WOMAN LOVES THAT YOUR IN THE WHITE HOUSE!
So beautiful! Thank You for bringing the Merry Christmas back! God Bless You! Merry Christmas to you and your family!
Just beautiful!!!  Takes your breath away!!
Thank you First Lady for the Beautiful Christmas Decorations of the White! House! You did an Amazing Job BLESS YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP & USA*
Well now we have gaudy in the White House, along with stupid.
Tacky....like trump.
Wonderful!
Beautiful
Beautiful!! Love our Flotus!
Superb.@FLOTUS has class
What a special sight
This is just beautiful. 
It brings tears to my eyesand reminds me WHY this nation is exceptional.
#ChristOurSaviorIsKing
Thank Heaven!!!! Merry Christmas Everybidy!!!!
Beautiful again! Always a pleasure seeing what our First Ladies come up with for decorating The People’s House!
Absolutely gorgeous! Thank you!
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MELANIATRUMP  @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump



This says it all .....  Our First Lady is an Angel 
SO BEAUTIFUL.  Thank You @FLOTUS &  @POTUS 
WOW!!!
It looks GORGEOUS!!!!
@FLOTUS as a little girl, did you ever imagine you would be doing all of this??  awesome job on the decorations -the video makes it look almost magical..
No as a little girl she was saluting father Stalin. Kind of like Trump does with Putin nowadays.
No I'm just trying to highlight how ridiculous it is to grant Melania all this but not the refugees, many of whom are children. Just trying to show how racism can lead to double standards and hypocrisy.
NVM forget it. Sometimes it's hard to climb out of the shell of ignorance. Sometimes it's just age that makes the brain dull. My experience has been if they are stupid enough to like Trump and Melania and support them. It's always a mistake to engage on discourse. So bye 
Run away, run away 
This was so magnificently festive.  I have never seen anything so warm and stunning.
Is this going to be your Christmas card?
Better than Allah cards.
“Including Christians”.
Nope. Not buying it. Have a Merry Christmas.
Of course you’re not buying it. It’s a well known fact. Merry Christmas
You can call allah whatever you want but hes not The God.

1 to be an immigrant is to immigrate somewhere other than where you were born to live permanently, if you’re born in America you’re not an immigrant, if you’re born in Canada and come to America you’re an immigrant 2 by your logic “native Americans” are immigrants too
No they are not...
If im born somewhere and live there my entire life im not an immigrant to that place, so to say white people in America today are illegal immigrants is incredibly stupid and show a lack of understanding for the word immigrant. I could understand if it was decedents of illegal +
+immigrants but most people alive in America arent decedent from the “first landers” onto America soil, or any of those colonists
I never said white peope were illegal immigrants. Stop putting words into my mouth and educate yourself on the history of North America
Neither did i, i never accused you of it and im very aware of the history of North America.
This is the most beautiful Christmas I have ever seen the White House.  It was breathtaking.  Thank you Melania.

There are two days of Christmas. None of which are in November.
It's not even Advent yet 

Nightmare
someone loves christmas
Why waste the money when your boy Donnie is NEVER THERE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY IT?

Awesome elegant beautifully done THANK YOU MRS FLOTUS AMERICA IS VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INFLUENCE AND LOVELINESS 
GOD BLESS YOU AND YOURS XOXOX
This is beautiful but there are so many families suffering & xmas means nothing to them.  the money spent could provide a xmas to a few families.
The most beautiful holiday Whitehouse elegant like our First Lady
presioso melania saludos s.e. donalt trump
I thought the decorations were absolutely stunning
How Beautiful!  :)
Beautiful work FLOTUS
Dear Beloved, And Beautiful Melania,
You are Loved and Admired More than any First Lady That has Ever been in the White House !!America is Thankful and Blessed to have you Serve. 
My husband & I Are Trump Supporters 100%!
Everything @POTUS @FLOTUS have done is try to bring back American pride. They see the @WhiteHouse as THE AMERICAN PEOPLE’s house. They did that FOR US.
Well that would explain why they're so averse to the idea of living in it
Right right, that's why Trump keeps insisting he has two residences bc he's still trying to make "the winter White House" become a thing.
Again....IDIOT. Likely has many more. ALL modern POTUS' had homes they often went to. GWB, Crawford ranch. Obamas, Hawaii AND Martha's Vineyard, which they RENTED and charged to us, Carter, his peanut farm. Nothing new here. I call my house the Lake House. Doesn't mean it's one.
All other presidents didn’t CONspire with an enemy to rig an election and didn’t make millions off of their “winter house” trump crime family.. keeping it real
Kind of heavy on the White dominance as a theme this year aren’t we?
Best it's Ever Looked
DON'T YOU WANT TO DISAPPEAR INTO AN ARMOIRE AND NEVER RETURN #NARNIA #YOURXMASGIFT
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They keep talking about class and elegance @FLOTUS was a ho. I guess @FLOTUS44 and those before her weren't nude "models"
Looks like crap. Fake like the President.
Beautiful and Very tastefully done. Merry Christmas to you and President Trump. 
waste of tax payers money.
I loved it, beautiful.
Iwouldnt disappoint that inthe world keeping into consideration that you are the favorite one
It’s beautiful, Melanie!
I LOVE Everything !!!
Great Work
The trees & ornaments were beautiful & the Whitehouse staff looked like they were filled with the spirit of Christmas. Great job everyone!
Beautiful... thank you FLOTUS for bring class back to the White House!
Love our White house

Bless your heart...you tried.
Simply gorgeous!  Breath-taking, even!
THE WHITE HOUSE LOOKS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!Thank you to "AMERICAS FIRST LADY".... A FIRST LADY W CLASS....
Former nude model
Hypocritical slut shamer.
Merry Christmas! It Looks Beautiful!
These are the most beautiful Christmas decorations that I have ever seen. Why don't all the haters just take the planks out of their eyes and enjoy them for what they are! Merry Christmas.
Beautiful!  I'm glad I came to your Twitter Tweet!  I saw a few negative posts on my facebook and knew that they were probably just hater comments just trying to make others think negatively.  Happy a jingle bell day!
Gorgeous
Great
красотка))
What have you done?  This is the ugliest thing i have ever seen.
Your decorations SUCK!
Merry Christmas to u also.. Thank you .. am proud to say u are our 1st lady
Beautiful!! So glad that you are in the White House!!
Absolutely beautiful!! Merry Christmas!
Who cares if the decorations are up at the WH. It's not important any more, all the Joy of the season has been trampled on by a person who thinks he rules the world.
Beautiful!!!
VERY BEAUTIFUL, MERRY CHRISTMAS.
Beautiful, and so thankful of the restoration of the words #MerryChristmas throughout the White House. GOD BLESS YOU
@POTUS @FLOTUS and @WhiteHouse

Merry Christmas to you, Melania and to your son.  Peace,
I think the white is beautiful.   I’ve never seen the White House look so elegant....like our First Lady
Will you be decorating Donnie’s prison cell for him next Christmas?
Beautiful !! Merry Christmas !
Absolutely gorgeous Christmas decorations in the White House!
Thank you First Lady for your exquisite taste.
The White House looks beautiful!  I love how you decorated with those white trees! It looks amazing. And I love that grey sweater you're wearing too. So stylish!

Wow this is absolutely beautiful!!!!!
Merry Christmas !!!
Classy! Very talented and intelligent! Love THE  FLOTUS!
Are you gonna make it until Xmas, Melania...could be gone B4 Christmas!!!!! Please LORD that would be the best present...
I believe the correct adjective is ostentatious.
Looks like a real nightmare - as the presidency of ur husband. Merry christmas!
Looks like shit. Hope your hubby lives a long life just to spite you. #IvankaTrump
U r so dumb just as your husband
Thank you Mts Trump for the most beautiful whitehouse Christmas we’ve ever seen SO much class
@FLOTUS    So lovely!  Class is back!
happy holidays 
nice one ma lady
Winter wonderland at the white house! Every year I look forward to seeing the decorations, looking back over the years I must say  this years are the best over all the Christmas's Beautiful breath taking and the smiles upon the childrens faces!!!!
when this is the most important thing you've ever done as the first lady
The First Noel is of unknown origin but generally thought to be English dating back to the sixteenth century.   America’s problems are deeply moral & spiritual when we replace Jesus with a banal cup of coffee and a happy holiday cup emblematic of a culture of Christian cleansing.
Stupid much?
the mot beautiful decorating EVER. subtle mix of winter wonderland, hebrew blues and silver and the best merry christmas theme, love it classy look from a classy lady <3
Absolutely beautiful

Christmas Isn't about decorating or competition..its about the birth of our heavenly father....no one seems to care anymore in this century
Gorgeous! Christmas blessings to you and yours, @FLOTUS
Superb!  Merry Christmas Melania!
Beautiful
Merry Christmas 
Absolutely beautiful!
How much did this tasteless, gaudy crap cost us??!!!! When are you deported Melania? Don't forget that Trumps real heart throb, @IvankaTrump Skankvanka moved into the WH before you! She moved in on the wrinkly, nasty,  2 1/2 inch thing u married! Hope the $ was worth it all!
White House Christmas decorations are way coo cool Mrs. Trump!
Gorgeous!
Omg FLAWLESS!!!! Absolutely gorgeous just like @FLOTUS
It's beautiful, 1st Lady Melania... Awesome selection and the warmth is spiritually transferable from the video footage. Thank you, for making the Christmas season tangible with your touch of your love.  May it overflow. Charise
Where's the Hanukkah bush ?
And the fact that you are still there has ruined my Christmas. You are sick dangerous demented people who have stained our democracy and the Whitehouse!
