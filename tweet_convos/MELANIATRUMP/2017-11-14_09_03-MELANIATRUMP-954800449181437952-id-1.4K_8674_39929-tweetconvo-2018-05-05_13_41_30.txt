Liberal are hateful people!
Yea isn’t terrible how they do things like legislate healthcare for all and want to guarantee civil rights for all. What terrible things will they think of next lol
Wasn't it so nice of your poster children to break store front windows, destroy private property and beat people with bike locks because they disagreed with them? Wasn't it so nice when your Dem political leaders condemned those actions? They didn't, instead, they said resist!
Lol lies seem to be your only defense. SAD BIGLY SAD go ahead keep supporting child rapists
I could say the same about pedowood, Bob Menendez and David Alcon! You guys own them! They are all yours!
Actually I am against all types of slavery that’s more your gig. I don’t own anyone
Far more then you deserve. Yes
The most Elegant. Amazing, courageous First Lady since Nancy Reagan. Thank you @Flotus  #FlotusInAsia
NOT
Thank you Our First Lady! We are very appreciative of your gracious care in representing the USA! We ask the Lord's Blessing on all you do to #MAGA! 
I personally would ask Willy Wonka for his blessings. He gives out golden tickets and the trumps love everything gold ! Plus they are both just literary characters so what’s the difference

Is that a Prostitute
Love Japan, my former "home away from home" as a flt att
America is so proud to have you as FLOTUS!

I’m sorry but as much as I hate the president and his administration #MelaniaTrump it’s a nice video and shows how caring you are

That blue dress is stunning, so elegant. I love the First Lady 
Everything is very nice and very special. the Japanese put a lot of heart into all this, it's a very good thing. The whole trip to Asia was spectacular, everything.
You are so elegant and beautiful....it's easy to see how much you care about children. God bless and keep you safe First Lady of The United States, Melania Trump! 
Thank you @FLOTUS for making #USA proud every step of the way!

Thank you a thousand times!!!
What an elegant FLOTUS.  I love our country and yes we are constantly improving because we can with our form of government.  Thought what a disgraceful GQ Cover.  After disrespecting our law enforcement, the fans, and the USA he gets his plastered on their GQ cover.

199 Schools DESTROYED by Saudi airstrikes in #Yemen leaving children with no education & fearing death by missiles. Worse? Nothing in #MSN! https://twitter.com/YemenPostNews/status/930466397926326274/photo/1pic.twitter.com/s3Lxln1VPv 
crazy how the middle east that hates all westerners and wants to seperate the heads from the bodies demands help from the same people.
We love you first lady @FLOTUS
God Bless you and @POTUS. Your beauty and grace has made the WH a place of Honor again. Thank you again from a true deplorable American.

“You have beautiful legs Queen Risita!!!
Think we can get together?
I have huge plans for you.”  Though these words may be appealing to you for most of us is a disgrace for we don’t treat women as an object you know?
What are you even talking about, you lunatic?
THANK-YOU Melania!
