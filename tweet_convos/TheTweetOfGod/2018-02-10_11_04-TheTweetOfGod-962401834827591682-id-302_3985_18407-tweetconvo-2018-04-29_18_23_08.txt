With no power comes great responsible - during load shedding
With great crimes comes great punishments
Unfortunately, no.

Finally found someone who makes some sense and that someone is god. 
I love gody
And people who worship you, don't actually worship you for you but for what you give them and can do for them, and being a creator don’t mean to ruinite you're own creations, you're responsible for what you create, many creatures don’t have free Will at all

And apologists! Bonus!!
hahahaha......there will be a time when I will practice this ...
Power should always be lived as a MEANS not as an END....
You've been watching too much #FoxBoobs dear Lord!
I’m going to start using your #FoxBoobs tag all the time now.  They make me want to vomit!  Especially @seanhannity!
In India:
normal #people:with great #Power, cometh Huge Power Bill 

#politicians: with great Power, cometh greater Desire for More Power
With Powers you become currupted, evil, hatred and misussive, criminal, and unrightous, you create what you desire and lust for and who you are as a person and what you do on a daily one, evil prevails but the good get punished and hated
You r not the God
NONSENSE AND HYBRIS
Boooo
It makes sense
True in today’s scenario.

@ayushmannk haha.....
Except Elon Musk. The space unicorn king.
Hallo God,
Wish you happy Mahashivaratri
Dear God, WTF? For years I’ve been taught your Son is our Savior... Really?
And a great utility bill
That’s how I live my life
Do you live in Queens?
42 @Thoroughbreds – at Sunray COOP/Bushland Mercantile
when combined with a @GOP controlled Congress it means no accountability either...
They just advance a bill that gutted the ADA & People with disabilities will lose their protections. I wish he had a massive stroke
Says who?
God. Doh!
(It was a Michael Cohen reference)
.... iresponsibility in defaulting the utilities bills
Indeed
Apparently.
You need to read the Bible again, silly one. And the Koran.

Definition of @realDonaldTrump
@iamkshitija07
Dear God. Why is it still here?
We all know that one president who proved just that
.... God, God, God!  Thought you left, but I see you back,doing that thing only You do, tell it like it is, you met Dr Phil?
@Eminem said it best
Apparently
True for most of our leaders.
With great power comes reaposabilities for the previous administration.
With great power comes no accountability.
Haha, Trumpology...
Dude, may I call you Dude? We are desperately in need of some old fashioned smiting. If you can come through with that I'll stop bugging you for a pony. Thanks!
With great power comes the irresponsibility to 'monetize' the presidency. #PimpingThePresidency
If only
Doesn't that (sadly) justify Trump remaining as president?
That was Uncle Ben...

 With great power, comes great theatrics
Just blame it on fake news
Well in that case, you and Trump finally have something in common
In your case it just proves the saying "absolute power corrupts absolutely" 
But should include an upgraded fuse box.
With Great Power comes Great Responsibility lol lol lol
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
... in this administration.
When you got great power...gotta know how to control it! That's the responsibility!!!
Amn
Amen let him come ,,, I surely want things to work

But ego can.!
Hey God, can you help me? My cat fucked off and I've been calling her all night. Since the back garden light is broken and I don't have particularly good vision at night, could you, perhaps you know, break out those night-vision goggles and make yourself useful? Her name is Cat.
Bender told us that!
“@TheTweetOfGod: With great power comes no responsibility.” For @KimJongUnNuking @kimjongun_fans @KimJongUnCoc @DPRK_News @SebGorka @POTUS
@TheTweetOfGod have You experienced any power?
R u fake god ..
In your case absolute power 
May be yes but in case of Donald Trump.
Is that why you smote Usha for touching the holy ark?
Bcz You have great power , those responsibilities are nothing for you!

You'd know
This is why I stopped listening to you.
Lol! You are a God with great musical taste! When I saw you followed JBeebs & no one else you gave me the giggles. Thanks!! 
With great power comes Grayskull
My God you’re right!!
that's very reassuring

Err. Guns to protect != Guns to kill.
Shouldnt that read as GRATE POWER .
That's funny
Apparently ..at least these days
What use is power if you have to be responsible too?
With Great Power comes Great Responsibility; with Unchecked Power,
Comes No Responsibility.
In parallel world we have our “Namo”
Get over yourself
#DickPOTUS45!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse
Damn you’re good.
I know, that is why i use my ability for good.
absolutely true.

Ha!  Apparently
Mordern day superhero etho!
Amén
So that's why you're not going upside Donald Trump's head with a lightning bolt.
That's no true power
With great (amount of) alcohol comes great irresponsibilities
"....have you ever gone mad without power? It's no fun, nobody listens to You.." The Simpsons
God is talking about how you’re acting @realDonaldTrump
Kinda the point of power
Be careful or they will take you out of the National Anthem!
Pretty please...and the money too.
Or accountability
Yep! Just ask Trump! 
Great with power, comes responsibility.
 thou shall not worship thy fake twitter God
"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give..."
We already knew what that POS  character was. Too bad the idiots that voted for him ignored it. Great quote though.
Yup this is all your fault.
What do you think Peter Parker?
Lord, i mean no dispespect, but previously the message was that to whom much is given, much is expected. Just sayin.
i’m sure it’ll work out
I know, right? 
Apparently
God, wouldn't NOW be a good time to smite his ass.... ???  Asking on behalf of the entire world...

You can’t be real. No blue 
Trump is butt. Sory, Not good english.  (I'm just kidding. My English is pretty good.) 
Current admin...
Lol so funny but it does depend to whom that is aimed at in this day and age
Donald trump
This is true Javerbaum. You are a good example of having power to write US sit-coms & look how awful they are.
so I can't blame it on you then?...that's why there's no point in YOU...
God , some of your tweets are profound
This is one of them !
What are you talking about all of them are profound
Still don’t get why you let this happen. Don’t you have smiting rights? And don’t give me that Free Willy BS again!
Soooooo, Trump is not responsible for the words, actions or outcomes...with this high power they call presidency? Hmmmmmm interesting....answers for alot
Next time your due a holiday, I can cover for you honest no problem, 
I can take no responsibility all day long.

Just to be sure we delegate the responsibility to others right? 
Or at least give out a free to call  phone number?
@realDonaldTrump
Who even cares if gervis likes or dislikes any tweet.
Evidently you do
so sad...sadly true
Clearly.
OUCH!
The biggest and most real truth of corruption
Just mysterious ways.
Since when? The very beginning of mankind? Or the immense resurgence of deflecting responsibility in January of 2016?
But you have zero power. Except for showing for up in toasted bread and dog asses.
That's what politicians think. They never learned that if you are going to lead your people, you must serve your people.
With no great power comes no responsibility?
Or consequences apparently.
Unless it’s electric power- then ground it
But of whometh are you talking 'bout, lawd?

Right? Just look at Trump lmao
Your ability to say the right thing so often is almost divine #uncanny
That seem like the only thing they are passing down now, no personal responsibility.
Is this prophecy about @GOP, @SpeakerRyan, and @SenateMajLdr ? It really feels like it.
Shit - that means he’s being successful!!
Übermensch
Nobody told Moses!!
trump is the perfect example
And no accountability
God catch me
I don’t want to like this.... I want a sad face option .... I  this

Yeah, we’ll, whatever.....
...but massive electricity bills
Oh yes there will be ...
Only if your name is Donald Trump.
Trump's words to live by
correct
Spiderman would have turned out a whole lot differently if old uncle Ben told him that
I’m in!
who would know better?
شو جاد عامل ريتويت ل التويت تبع الله 

Seems so.
And with no responsibility comes heaven
How do i follow you
Can you explain this?

With stolen power comes no responsibility
Hum,now I understand Trump
And a long pole with a piano on the end
