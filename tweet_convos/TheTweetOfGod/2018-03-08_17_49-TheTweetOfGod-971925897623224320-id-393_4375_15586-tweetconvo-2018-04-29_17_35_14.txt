Really? Complaining about potential peace breakthrough??? Iran, Israel, Korea, Cuba. Trump winning for us all.
It's a joke. Of course it's good if it follows through.
I got the joke but coming from a massive Trump hater and Obama/Clinton lover it came across differently.
@realDonaldTrump was suppose to be this savior for the "little guy", the "forgotten" lower/middle class in America. Yet he now calls himself the "stock market president". Over 60% of people in this country have zero market exposure, and most of that 60% are his lower class voters
He’s a politician. But he’s trying to be good. I say he’s basically succeeding.
It's just that if anything even close to this had happened to Obama, there would have literally been calls for his head
Amazingly, you're serious.
Of course he was scandal free because our leftist media protected him.

Here’s a list:…
Uranium One
Seth Rich
Wall St
Cuba
Israel
TIPP
Food stamps
Etc
"And they will talk person to person.

Saint peter is going to have a lot of work...
Saint Peter won't see any of them. The doors to hell, on the other hand, will be flying off the hinges.
I know... I don't think the new expansion to intake was enough.
Told you to invest more, Uncle.
Well I figured the dumb worms would at least have enough pride to want to live and not kill themselves all at once.
Why do you have more faith in humanity than I do?
Though I may have been cast out, I still have the hope of the morning's dawn.
That's like something you'd hear in a Nolan-directed Batman movie. I dig it, Luci.
Blood brothers. Its like they were seperated at birth.  Is he going to give them top secret sub locations during the meeting like he did with Russia?
Stop advocating violence, Greg.
I read that as: Kim and Trump will meet in prison. Wishful thinking...
At first glance, I thought the headline read 
"Kim Jong-Un and President Trump will meet in prison"
and I smiled

#resist #meetingofthemines
Pest from the west meets the beast from the east!

Jetzt wird alles besser.
 

This tweet pretty much sums up this entire fucking saga of badness.
I feel like I can't like this tweet.
Oolon Culoofid mentioned this in his writing the follow up to his first smash hit, concluded not one of your best ideas.
I would think that Kim knows that @realDonaldTrump does not speak or act with the favor of the majority of the United States.

@TheTweetOfGod knows everyone knows that except, #Trump!!

So carry on.
Mr Putin serves a tea for both..
"woud you like some Polonium in your tea?"
Will they sniff each other’s butts and then go pee on a lamppost?
One could only hope..

doubtful tho!
@JynxJxmi  look at dis
Lol what
@MichaelFortney @aliesha_mcevers  hahaha
I'll be going the other way.
Never did he just tweet this
Oh My!  I read the headline to be, "Kim Jong-un and President Trump will meet in PRISON"   hahahahaha
^.^
Holy sh....
Tease
@HatsJohnny 
Wow haha hehe huhuhu bhrbhRK
Ivanka will meet the North Koreans. What a disgrace!
Lol
I wish they'd meet in prison instead.
You simply have to realize that Kim Jong-un hates America with a passion. He sees that a bit of seeming capitulation to the Donald for the time being could get Donald re-elected. Voila! Kim gets to do America great damage! Kim has become a student of Putin's in this regard.
I stated to my husband, after hearing about this meeting with Kim Jung-On, that perhaps Putin suggested Kim invite Trump over, have him killed or kidnapped & Putin & Kim become world leaders, while secretly Putin plans to have both killed. Crazy? Maybe not...
All I can say is that if that does indeed happen, "Heather McDaniels" will become a household name.
Oohh. Hmm. I don't know if I could handle the publicity. Unfortunately, once words are said, you can't take them back. I don't like Trump at all, but this IS one time I hope he returns fairly unscathed from a trip. (Gawd, that made me gag.)

I believe I see a supernatural reference?






I would think the devil himself would be the one who would be seeing Trump soon
What could go wrong?
God knows.. and he tweeted it 
I just hope he's wrong. I'm not ready to see him yet Maybe king Donald and Kim will bore each other to death with their endless BS and we'll all be better off.
Trump being Trump ..he will screw it up.. it’s a given.. Lets see if this even happens. Trump says a lot of crap then reneges.. He’s an impulsive ahole..
Changes like mountain weather.
it won't happen in N. Korea. They don't have McDonald's there.
Why wait? One well-placed lightning bolt...  Or did you mean all of us?
Please...one well placed lightning  bolt solves our problems

I see your plan now
Welp god
I read that as will meet in prison.  I think it was wishful thinking on my part.

How amazing would it be in Kim reached over the table and smacked him across the face???
Kim Jong Un should donate a part of his hair to Trump
Question God, will he be able to keep his hair in Hell?
They spelled prison wrong.
Well...  Shit.
Misread it as “will meet in prison.”  Hmmmm. 

@MurfAD @TabathaSouthey @paulisci @heartsnark @steveburgess1 @sadmonsters @EnlightFundy @paulisci @JimONeilPOV
@realDonaldTrump stay safe President Trump and President of South Korea. I don't want to judge but I wonder what Prime Minister/President Jong Un Kim's up to? I hope he really has had a true change of heart.

God bless, Matthew 16:18
Wait, they’re going to heaven?
You have so little faith, God.
Probably not all of us. Some, if not most are headed somewhere else entirely.
ryan pls  
Oh nah 
I reckon Kim will have a double wearing a suicide vest to take out Trump at the meet 
this shit is equally as funny as it is not funny. idk wtf to do.

I just glanced at the headline and for a brief moment I thought it said "meet in prison" and I was all excited.
Can someone PLEASE disconnect their nuke buttons while they are away at the meeting?
https://giphy.com/gifs/8McNH1aXZnVyE/html5 …

I’m good with that! I’m tired of all the bullshit on this planet.
More than likely.
I know I haven’t been the best person, but please let me in.
Does anyone else think this is a _really_ bad idea?!
They'll be at 36% that You WON'T see, but I suppose You already knew that, You being You.
Woahhh..see you soon @joshitaaaaa
#TRIM #DJ

@joelegomez lol
thats a deep dee joke
I have 9 lives ! 
May lightening strike them both at the same time....please God, please.
Well damn 
Well you said it, "all" this could get crazy.
Live this to @s8n he/she will do better job. 
Hopefully he won't shoot his mouth off and screw up  negotiations.
If they dont get on well with each other itll be WW3, and if they DO, itll be WW3..
Do you believe there is a chance they both take the opportunity to assasinate the other and succeed ?
In person or in prison?
Pretty sure they’re just setting up a chain of barber colleges.
Oh my!!
I am worried abt @indiatvnews now!!!
These great warriors should slap fight to the death.
@hardys0803

How long after the meeting will it be before they both deny everything they said to one another?
hear putin will supply the nerve gas ...
No. Send Pence!
Try not t f this up
Wao
God don’t waste your time; just send them both to hell and get over quickly! 
oy


i can't stop laughing!!!! brilliant comment @TheTweetOfGod
I'd bring the beer.
Aww. More bitterness because President is doing something BO couldn’t.
Lord help us all
Dammit. Not before Avatar 2.
Lol
Right on, brother.
Yeah, see you soon mate, I'm on my way!
Satan just bought a parka.
Had to read it twice, I thought it said "Prison".
Where and when? To the exact time and coordinates if you don’t mind
Here's hoping Kim offers Trump a tissue to wipe his face after their McDonalds lunch.
@TheTweetOfGod Please send a laser focused lightning strike.
Amen!
That makes no sense
At quick glance thought it said “will meet in prison “. My heart skipped a beat.
Kim’s father said basically the same years ago. It’s just BS!
Dim and Nit
@atefmkalled
Reviewed in context of SC Mueller progress, N. Korean chemicals to Syria, Stormy saga, visit of Russian national security bosses, steel tariffs, etc., hope this isn’t orchestrated by silent partner/player to shift media spotlight from Trump/Putin stories to anything else
i read it..will meet in prison..blv then i got it correctly.. it is in person.

i got your eyes Godi...
LOL that's funny
The meeting of two mean, stupid clowns 
Come on send the bees, locusts, frogs, honestly any plague will do.

Lol
Uhhhhhhh, @elonmusk HOWS THE MARS THING COMING ALONG!?
Otto Warmbier
Really Supar Power Trump AMRICA  talk to Kim Jom  N . Korea  Chef !  Unbelievable !  Peace for World ?

Can,t go yet owe tax money 
God, please kill these two person.
Maybe not ALL...
Does either of them count as a person?
Think Chung will shake hands with the poison on them that he killed his brother with?
And every professional assassin out there just wet their pants
How do I greet you Lord?  Do I genuflect or do I grovel?  Do we shake hands or do I wave my hands in the air.  Will there be a welcome party with drinks and nibbles?
Everyone except these two 


Please God take both of them!

Finally
Please don't mention the hair. Please don't mention the hair...

I was waiting for that 
Not *all* of us... some heading straight down south I’d imagine...
@Apenbil
Nice
Just drop a lightning bolt on the meeting and call it good.
This is fake news.  Kappa
And this is the point were I really wish you were real and could actually organise a double lightning strike. Oh well I can dream.
Talk about when shit hits the fan.
Lol
Did you freeze hell?
Now you're actually scaring me...
Rocketeers.
Ab dangal hoga
Dear God, if ever there was a time we good humans needed an 'act of God' it is when these two are in the same room together.
Givem' hell God. @realDonaldTrump #NorthKorea #incompetent
Joke's on you.  I'm going to hell
Looking forward. Talk to you as per on Sunday!

Poison time? 
It’s probably a trap, he should definitely go.
You gonna join them at @McDonalds in Seoul?
McDonald's Itaewon
Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea · +82 70-7017-0305
Open 24 hours
God are you saying this is not a good idea? Is this a nuclear trigger warning? BOOM!
Trump shouldn't go to NK as the guy Kim is Deceptive and Diabolic .He may even resort to Homicide of the American President ...Both NK and China can't be ever believed ..Both are cheaters to the core .

Hence he should go and meet Trump in US ..

Damn..
Break out the VX!
Oh jeez
@lionelmessijeet @ADshady13
No. Wait! I thought this is when Hell freezes over!
Not all of us 

When he gets there you should put him on gate duty just to f with people.
In your dreams.
$50 says Lucifer is already in line waiting like he's about to get a cheap TV on black Friday.
The HANDSHAKE.   I can't wait to see how Trump tries to unbalance Kim by jerking Kim's whole arm toward Trump.
From your mouth to Go.... wait. I shouldn’t say it.
I wonder if they'll compare buttons
Bullshit. It will never happen.
*Nervous laughter
Well two of the worlds biggest dickheads going to meet.
What the hell can be discuss, of course both will say I can destroy more than u.
Not too soon, I hope!
Don’t you want to pass them on to your nemesis?
I’d rather have Dennis Rodman do the negotiating.
Why do i think Trump is about to take credit for welcoming north Korea back into the mainstream.....?
Why do i think that him Putin et al are conning us all.
Aaaaaand that's a rapture!
What could go wrong?
