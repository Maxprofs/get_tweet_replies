@TheTweetOfGod don't go there God.
@conserv_gal @TheTweetOfGod Gun violence is far more offensive than a comment about gun violence will ever be.
@J2_0 dude, this was so 5 days ago. You missed that train. "The ship has sailed".
@conserv_gal Sorry, I have a life outside my Twitter feed. Insult not accepted.
.@J2_0 that wasn't an insult. Trust me, you'd know. And you can't favorite your own tweet, it's lame. #ByeFelicia
School shootings happen nowhere in the world like it does in America
And you do live like that 
Are u crazy? A friend lost a child in that shooting - please apologize for your tweet.
It’s a re-tweet from 3 years ago. What, is he suppose to know that a previous tweet would be offensive 3 years later? U know he’s not actually God
@TheTweetOfGod 
The right to own a gun seems to supercede the rightt to live. Ridiculous.
@stpeteyontweety @TheTweetOfGod owning a gun does not infringe on other's right to life
Tell that to the parents whose children were shot
Why did you reply two and a half years later with an emotional appeal masked as an argument
The simple act of "owning a gun" doesn't inherently infringe on anyone's right to life. Bu that is not to say a gun is not the most effective tool to do so or that better legislation is needed to affect their prevalence
How’s that murdering of innocents in Syria and North Korea working out? Killing who you need killed? China doing your work in the killing vans? Israeli kids blown up in school buses getting you hard?
Sam bade tak you  money  how'd  you  fall a Don  ting you can ansr  can you  fat food

Sadly, that's a pretty accurate recap of what they think.
.@TheTweetOfGod if only the government would stop staging these shootings. Gov't loves false flags to attack the 2 amendment or other rights

Amen!
(it's too hard to 'Like' this one)

Only a completely paranoid moron would totally ignore facts and oppose stringent gun laws. America would be a joke if this common recurrence wasn't so tragic. I feel for those poor families who lost love ones
"facts"
I'd call a large number of children who are actually dead, "fact". What do you call it? "Prayers"? Get an education.
What are you on
Suffer little children.. er.. period.
When will be the next one?
@TheTweetOfGod stupid
Not sure what you are getting at Ryan. Please explain.
All I know is that Trump is good and Norm is funny ... simple as fucking that!
made a mistake there God... it is ALWAYS freedom FROM and never freedom to...things like free speech = freedom from speeches. Liberty to voice does not sound same so people forget and the US specially chose to use both as same.
Liberty to
Freedom from
Universe has only free from
Do you gat  Sam shat hat lekar  ha ha layen
Oh, god...step in, eh?

And you have to be one of the stupidest persons ever!
"... You want Gun Control?  Get rid of the metal detectors around the Capitol building.  Take away the Secret Service protection for all politicians.  Christ, by next week the worst thing you'll have to worry about is drive-by SHOUTINGS."

-Dennis Miller,  'Ranting Again'
I almost pity the fact that you think you can sit behind your screen and say all this shit whilst claiming the name “God”, as if that gives you the right. Come out from behind ur screen boi and it won’t be so easy 
Hey everyone lets slowdown on the "thoughts & prayers" we're going to need some for the next time...
Do something

Last time people were wasted in your house ... 

We're gonna run out of safe places to gather for a purpose other than shooting rinks and gun stores. Perhaps that's where education and worship should occur, no?
Collateral damage to preserve the right to shoot up a school.
Smite the NRA & GOP
Oh, the irony!
Trump probably has this tattooed on his ass next to a picture of the NRA
Thanks, Big G. 
Guns don’t kill people. Bullets in guns fired by people kill people.
Step in and alter our 'free will' whenever you want pal...
not to mention forced belief in you and denial of your use of evolution, at your bequest of course
That’s fucking genius. Perfect.
Tell America how to stop it... their money says they trust you, I heard you bless them like all the time
In UK we don't get schooled on how to shoot people dead.
Because we don't have access to weapons.
He can retweet this every month, that's America for you
@BillOReilly agrees with u....
At only about one school shooting a week, parents can relax at the weekend. 'Will my child be shot next week at school?', Friday pm, ah not this week, weekend off, Monday 'Will my child.......' ad infinitum. UK is far from perfect, but shootings is not a thing. My heart goes out
This tweet should make no sense... Sadly... It makes perfect sense somehow...
There’s a time and a place for everything and this isn’t it
Noticed that tweet is more than 2 years old? Not time yet?
Good spot, all I saw is it was on my timeline but I stand by my reply. Not time yet, maybe tomorrow
@cwmonaghan
KISS OFF TWEET OF....
@TheTweetOfGod 
God! 
Damn the GOP! 
@TheTweetOfGod @campbellb_ @bsbeckerz
my new favorite Twitter account is officially @TheTweetOfGod. just made my whole day
@TheTweetOfGod @BumpinGemz Then tell the US gov to stop doing it.
@TheTweetOfGod @thejimfella @garyclarke86
@TheTweetOfGod @MrOzAtheist @GSpellchecker Nail. On the head. You hit it
@TheTweetOfGod @MrOzAtheist My dream us to one day be shot down while learning.
@TheTweetOfGod @MrOzAtheist It seems to be the American way. No connection between gun crime and right to bare arms. Duh!
@TheTweetOfGod Beatify Jim Jeffries, he speaketh the truth!
@TheTweetOfGod @PeterRelph
@TheTweetOfGod @JustJen64 You've been rereading Job, haven't you?
@TheTweetOfGod Truest of the saddest truths ! ..
@TheTweetOfGod 
touchdown almighty
@TheTweetOfGod @Paul_Bettany That does not make any sense...
@SarahAwachi @TheTweetOfGod What what? 
@TheTweetOfGod @rezaaslan or the freedom to carry out school shootings, iff you weigh up the consequences of justice and retribution
@TheTweetOfGod @rezaaslan @_ArgyleSweater
@TheTweetOfGod @clikchic Fpr reference, see the gospel of Smith&Wesson .38
@TheTweetOfGod man, this is kinda chilling to read.
@TheTweetOfGod @comictonypowell School Shootings is a small price to pay for 'Gun Free' schools.
@TheTweetOfGod Irony of a foolish antidote.. People getting killed?  .. More gun freedom please!. #NRA ., stands for Not relevant anymore .
@TheTweetOfGod @NYmaryann THIS ISN'T GOD...YOU'RE ALL FUCKED...& REMEMBER 3 CLIPS IS NOT ENOUGH...NOW WHERE'S MY TRUSTY COLT?...xjj
@TheTweetOfGod God only knows school shootings are, without a single exception, all hoaxes... stop spreading bullshit, God.
@TheTweetOfGod saving this to use in a debate
@TheTweetOfGod @Sirensongs Everyone who died was enjoying the right to be unarmed, which is a popular new thing I don't really understand.
@TheTweetOfGod only God could get away with saying something totally evil like that. It almost beats some of the shit you say in the Bible.
@TheTweetOfGod religious schools...
@TheTweetOfGod Or the freedom to commit school shootings. #freedumb  #gunnuts https://twitter.com/thetweetofgod/status/651553894640824320 …
@TheTweetOfGod sir,

The NRA has decided to pull its prayer support of you until you have a more gun friendly message
#scaretactics
.@TheTweetOfGod @maritzasolito we need #guncontrol, not #RWNJs
@TheTweetOfGod then cure mental illness
@TheTweetOfGod Thank you for the LOL . You made my day
@TheTweetOfGod She has spoken
@TheTweetOfGod omfg
@TheTweetOfGod Can you make the guns of the bad folks backfire and shoot them, like on Bugs Bunny?
Wise God, ha ha!
RT @TheTweetOfGod: "School shootings are a small price to pay for the freedom to be killed in school shootings."
@TheTweetOfGod @Iamlukebarnett How can you be shot at a school? It's a gun-free zone.
@TheTweetOfGod @Iamlukebarnett all know best way 2 protect yourself from shooters is 2 remove your ability 2 protect yourself from shooters.
@TheTweetOfGod @Iamlukebarnett We gotta stop criminals from doing illegal things by making more things illegal.
@TheTweetOfGod @fakeKevinDJ
@thetweetofgod that's kinda messed up tho
@TheTweetOfGod you surely cant believe that?
@TheTweetOfGod @AugustLady241  Praise God from whom all wisdom flows....!
@TheTweetOfGod @Vodkaninja this is all your fault
@TheTweetOfGod We need to arm the students. Only if you are on the principals honor roll can you pack heat and light up potential threats.
@TheTweetOfGod the sooner god and guns don't get mentioned in the same sentence, the sooner there's a chance for peace.
@TheTweetOfGod
This would be hilarious if it were not tremendously tragic.
@TheTweetOfGod Too far dude...
@TheTweetOfGod stupid thing to say.
@TheTweetOfGod I hear you, but no.  I own no gun and would gladly relinquish the right to in order to feel like my kids are safe.
@TheTweetOfGod @KyleKulinski Birth control?
BAN IT!
Abortion?
BAN IT!
Gay marriage?
BAN IT!
Drugs?
BAN IT!
Guns?
Look, bans never work.
@TheTweetOfGod really?
@TheTweetOfGod @MGBazemoreJr It might be saidit's a huge price to pay to have a "Gun Free Zone".
@TheTweetOfGod i don't think it sounds as poetic as it did in your head
@TheTweetOfGod @TheTweetOfGod: Car accidents are a small price to pay for the freedom to be killed in car accidents. #feartheinanimate
@TheTweetOfGod Fantastic.
@TheTweetOfGod #Murica
@TheTweetOfGod I followed you for a reason but this is too far. Ouch.
@TheTweetOfGod awful
@TheTweetOfGod Bad tweet!
@TheTweetOfGod OMG you've become a mouthpiece for the NRA
@TheTweetOfGod calm down Satan
RT @TheTweetOfGod: School shootings are a small price to pay for the freedom to be killed in school shootings. // Mal… cierto, pero mal
@TheTweetOfGod LOL Sensitive ass Americans.
@TheTweetOfGod I thought you were playing CS:Go from up above.
@TheTweetOfGod I wish I had time to read all the responses of people who don't get it!
@TheTweetOfGod @Auragasmic did you know this guy has harassed women who tweeted about not finding him funny?
@TheTweetOfGod @cathywilcox1 halaylooya
@TheTweetOfGod Awful... until you get it.
@TheTweetOfGod we should ban schools. That's the only way to stop them
@TheTweetOfGod I'm guessing none of the deceased are your relatives?
@TheTweetOfGod wait, I though they said you were the one who gave them the right to own?

MERICA RT @TheTweetOfGod: School shootings are a small price to pay for the freedom to be killed in school shootings.
@TheTweetOfGod luckily the education at these community colleges and public schools is soooo good it's worth dying for! #rollthedicepussies
@TheTweetOfGod Repeal the 2nd Amendment
@TheTweetOfGod Guns don't kill people. People use guns to deny victims the right to life. Gun violence is a public safety issue.
@TheTweetOfGod Congress Won't Pass Gun Control So You Have The Right To Be Shot In School Your Tax Dollars At Work
@TheTweetOfGod Congrats on your 500★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/651553894640824320 …
