You are hardly ever there. Lol 
Me everyday brotha
I have my own 'church'.
Thought I'd stay at home and play with the dog.

Love from Damien
I am invoking my personal Twitter rule....if you mention a dog you are obliged to share a pic  ...please
Bear Dog
That is a great big bundle of love in doggy form 
Well this whole thread didn't go in quite the direction I'd been expecting... But nice pics!
Tweet of god does strange things!
Harekirshna
Nei, bare #NRKdebatten 
Let's play uno(i won't say at your place though) :P
Can you spread the word to all your disciples on Earth to buy #ffwd on the AIM markets...and then help make it rocket? Go on...they invest in cannabis...there’s a sly spliff in it for you God if you do?! Hello?! Go on...you know you want to?
Hinduism began with 33 crore gods and goddesses.  In Hinduism people can become gods and goddesses.  In 1993 one person said the number is 36 crore gods and goddesses.  It seems you are one of them.
I can feel your frustration.  Try harder mate! Your hate towards a particular religion is quite clear. Shame!
Shame on fraudster who claims to be god and makes fun of people who go to church.
so fault lies here all these days i was convincing my fellow mates how good christians are. thanks for proving me wrong. you are the ones who have been making fun of our customs and convert poor in the village side with the help of money. even jesus won't spare you.
Somebody claimed to be god and made fun of Christians who go to church on Sundays. I made fun of him.  How did you come in?  Identify yourself.
@YourTara 
God : skipping church since man created him.
Why would I go if you're not there, huh?
...cuz he's everywhere. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
Or nowhere 
Holy f*** man you are scary dude I wouldn't shoot you from a thousand feet afraid I'd piss you off.
lol  ..hey i’m a peaceful easy going person ..
How does God NOT have a Verified Account?
My Bear and I do nature Church :) that's all we need!
Every week!  A priest said to my mom "It's more sinful to go to church as a habit than stay out"
I'm sure the #NRA send their #ThoughtsAndPrayers
Twitter is my church. You 'orrible lot are my congregation... 
Bloody hell.
That's a great psuedonym for twitter.

#BloodyHell
I woke at 4:20 and praised you appropriately.  We're all good.
Someday I will start remembering the significance of 4:20. 
For a good chuckle
I love the comments section too
Lol chilluminati
That was my fav
Love creator who created all of us
Haven't gone in 2000 years.
Aren't you guys technically always there?!
Nope. That's just something the men taking your money say. We hate church.
Sorry.. Like omnipresent.. That was my excuse not to go to church.. 'if god is omnipresent, I can pray at home.. Or in a field... Or in the cinema..' 
Your real true name is  I AM
@nahalrita
What's 'church' ?  
Hahaha
the sun is out and it's getting warmer, so i'll be going outside to enjoy nature, and that is my church
Yes. Someone here is on my frequency. I will be outside soon, within nature. The notion of me worshipping the same Abrahamic God is debatable, but in my mind that is just an avatar of a greater force... Your choice on what avatar you find inspiration in is a personal one.
Let us break bread and have a margarita.
That's nice
I get paid to be at church (musician), so I rarely miss it, even though I'm an atheist. Bless you, believers, for paying me for my labors.

That’s freaking fantastic!#dogmasucks
HAIL SATAN !!!!! 666 
I'm stealing this! Love it
I never miss church.  And church never misses me!
You should see someone about that ass-piss, my child.
I forgot.  HT South Park the episode where Cartman got Tourette's. PISS.. coming from my ass... 10 years later and I still walk around saying that completely out of context in the middle of Kroger
Since you're everywhere, I decided not to.
Not necessarily "skipping". I'd rather be out in nature that God created smoking some herb rather than sit in a judgmental church that man built.
Oh whoa. We must be related spiritually, because that would be an ideal day of worship.
Either related or just 2 hippie stoners
It's probably both. Not by blood, but by spirit. We will keep on reincarnating, and now with technology we can find one another and carry on where the 70s left off. 
I knew dis nia not listening to none of his homies prayers!!
Hi
Who said mass ?
Only exercise I ever do! And I am diligent at skipping it.
Omg !!!! 
राम राम
I've been doing that for five years.
@SenoraCatolica @Sra_Catolica
Let’s start the skipping church me too movement.
N@

lol I do like how you made the word dog actually be god backwards...clever.
Might stay at home and watch the new Lord @rickygervais
Is this what you did instead?
My back hurts
It was a toss up between church or bed.. so I compromised - I’m watching a Netflix documentary about a cult in Oregon 
By church you mean bar then I went.
Fool
You are not supposed to go to Church, mosque or temple. You must go to brains of humans as going to their hearts has not helped bringing world to an order
Save me Jebus!!
Pub?
good call all those people annoying you every sunday:)
Yas
Every Sunday and all the more important this Sunday because I had a hangover from Saint Patrick’s Day.
We have had countless adventures together skipping that hell hole.
You  XD
I worked a double shift on the Sabbath. Does that mean I have to get stoned to death twice?
I skip church every week... Sorry brah. 
You might catch me dead there.
Went to pub instead
i dont go to the church.... ayyyyyyy
18+ years church free!
Dear God,

You are damn right to skip church today!
I will sub in for you! No worries!

Sincerely, Lucifer

Ps. There are some stains in the confession booths!
Knew I forgot something. That's 28 years in a row now. God dammit.
Me,  too
It’s your day or rest, anyway.
Fo Show!

If you didn't go to mosque on Friday, it would only be fair
I gave up Christianity for Lent
I almost played hooky but my husband wanted me out of the house.
Then who the fuck am I supposed to pray too?
I went - thought you were in remarkably good form. Especially as things are about to get serious with Easter and all
#dog
#smarterthantrump
There is church today?
#thisguy ......
every Sunday.
Lol!!!!
Do ur priests rape girls in middle school?
meeeeee
God to work
U know ppl go there for u
You #fakegod dude. Think im daft?
I prefer coffee and breakfast with my husband.
Ooh. Me me
Oh God, you did not. I was there with a bunch of other people, and it was inspiring. You did a great job bringing us together.
Always!
somehow i can only read this in the james earl jones "i always assumed you had sex with your bathers…i know i do" vioce
I read your tweet but right below is a make-do for peanut butter cookies, and I'm reading your tweet but watching the peanut butter fold in... I'm going straight to hell, aren't I?
I don t go because it is not real
Your mum
I haven't been ever since the moneylender incident. Ironically, they won't let me back.
That's how it all starts!
You do this every weekend and yet you’re still the most popular religion in the world #shame good thing I only pray to tentacles
I went to mass yesterday good message from the Gospel
Liar. I saw you there. 

Wait a minute....
I haven't been for years, Sir. Only You understand why
No surprise, you were never there.
Joining you!
Too hungover from the party with St. Patrick?
That's like hosting a party at your house and not showing up
I’m in the back yard searching under a rock.
It's funny because you've never been. Ever.
Best God ever!
@aanumufeedh 
I remember church... Where all the hypocrites would dress up and say how God loved you for what you were inside...  
God, whoever you are, I like you a lot. You are way more fun than the one they preach. 
I hope the real one is closer to you (if he/she exists, against all odds )
Church? What's that?
Me too!!
Skipped church for clothes shopping with my daughter and then we joined husband and son fir a late lunch over some beers. BBQ pork nachos are all the enlightenment I needed today.
Yummy! Enjoy!
Whom do u like more, Caths or prots?
Here. Here.
Will you sign my permission slip? 
And here I was saving a spot, I feel like your Son now.
Abandonings issues that will cost you at least a Freud .....
Reality is my church - impossible to skip
Fine I laughed you got me

That's okay. I gave up Christianity for Lent years ago.
I’m sorry, but skipping implies that I ever went. But of course, You already knew that.
I skip church todas and I Will continue to skipping the rest of my data.
I took my nature walk....that's the only TRUE church a person needs.
I never go there
I am skipping church forever, soz. Except for weddings, funerals and christenings (for those who are hedging their bets or trying to get their kids into certain schools )
Please don’t strike me down because that will be well embarrassing...
I'm watching the golf. Way better then praying to some invisible guy! (way better)
Who you rooting for? #iceman
You always have and always will
I don’t believe in you everyday, not just Sunday.
Shhh, they will never realise.
Who isn't?
Ummm, God? I quit going to church when I was 10 and stopped believing in fairytales and sky daddies.
Are you even god? WTF is wrong with you? Why are you on Twitter?
#breaksilenceonafrin
Yeah, it's easy for a sinful impostor to skip church. No surprise there LOL

I figure you be happier if I celebrate in the “creation” you made than some edifice built by mere mortals, so it’s to the beach I go mate
Let’s skip every week 
Me! Haha

I'm conserving energy, and gas! Gas from the pulpit, fire from the heathen clerics, science from the Republicans, nuclear fuel from Iran and nerve agents from the Russkies. Is the Red Brigade still in business? Then, them too. Otherwise, dump all trash on the Republicans.
Damn! Missed it again. That's the 48th year in a row now
Every trump supporter it seems
I went to the church of get up early and play outside.
Sunday at my house means a leisurely coffee with an apple cider donut .

Is it those hungover catholics again?
That's me.
I stand with God.
I stand next to you standing with God, if that's ok with you two?
In the absence of celestial guidance can you just stand behind the line please. No crushing.
It's a reasonable request.
I skip it everyday...
I was too. But mom is making me go! Lol. Says I need more church.
Me for sure!!
Nah

Same!!! Mental health day!
Thoughts and prayers still count, right?
God,u forget u r not Lord just for the church goers but for also believers  without cross, multy devine, one devine and also no devine
I often reminded u about things that your highly paid secratery can't do.
Yet u gave me no award or reward for it...at least a place in paradise

@thaj1984 
Is this a test ? Are you testing me Lord ?
What is church
Not safe in America anymore anyway. So there is that.
Drove past a few earlier, some even had people in them.
Thank god i am not the only one
Skipped it for the last 37 years mate !!
Place is full of beasts and paedos mate
Shit! Didn't know you wouldn't be there. Guess I wasted my morning
I did! It was fab!
That's because You don't belong to any religion. 
I've skipped church....well practically my entire life.
Oh god, et tu??? with 86% world population still ‘sponsor’ a god
Probably  a hangover from the green beer.
I skipped today and the previous week also :P
Is there no higher authority above you?
@rdfrs @rickygervais 

Isn’t it weird how few religious zealots actually follow god on twitter but do follow Ricky
I never skip not going to church
I always do... I honestly can't remember the last time I was inside a church, where I wasn't a tourist... Despite My local church being literally like a 2 min walk away
@frostbabay
The Bangladesh cricket team!
We are, by default
Same
I’m doing some housework today...and after the “chore play” is complete, hopefully wine and sexual Congress with my wife.
whats a church?
I only ever see or hear you at AA or NA meetings anymore ... glad you hang with us bro
Your the most atheist God ever

Isn't Church just two or more people that talk about God?
Good god
God rules

Me too
I have a lot of questions for you. Where can we meet up?
The DEVIL is alive and flourishing in Conservative intolerant Evangelical churches.  Below is lastest picture of David Dennison, aka Donald Trump, who’s been f**king up a Stormy porn queen.
pls don't skip on trump. his american show is just starting to thrill us asians
You’re mad soft G lol for real tho
Check
