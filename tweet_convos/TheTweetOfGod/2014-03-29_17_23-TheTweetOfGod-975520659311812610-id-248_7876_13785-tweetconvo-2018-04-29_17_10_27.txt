You don't hate the Bible, you just don't agree with some of the things inside it.
Here's where you and I will disagree most strongly, Pierce. I am a life-long atheist, & I doubt I'll ever change. I think the Bible is mostly fiction. I even doubt that Jesus of Nazareth, either divine or mortal, ever existed.
"Mostly fiction"?  Sounds like you have some doubts.
Precisely
I still have nothing but respect for you Kait, and I enjoy talking with you.  Let me know if you would ever like to just talk about whatever interests you.
@saranev
At first glance, I thought "who is this random bitch throwing biblical shade my way" but OIC

Forgot you were on twitter and this threw me AGAIN

یادِ اون جوک افتادم که طرف می‌ره تو جایگاهِ شهود یه قرآن می‌دن دستش. می‌گه چی‌کارش کنم؟ می‌گن برای صدقِ مدّعات ازش استفاده کن. می‌گه همین تو کونِ هرکي دروغ بگه.

That's  foooooour
Ignorance
you can increase the range using a trebuchet
what about Quran??

GOD IS HOLY AND HIS WORD IS THE TRUTH. GOD, HAVE MERCY ON ALL OF THEM LAUGHING . Father, forgive them for they not know what they are doing

@josnoopy29 @TheTweetOfGod @CletisStump Talk about the Hand of God ... good pitching arm!
@txstarkeeper @TheTweetOfGod @CletisStump just found it interesting ...
@josnoopy29 @TheTweetOfGod @CletisStump Yeppers!!!

Look here. I admit I've got a bunch of bibles so should know if it is accurate. I definitly miss at close range quite often XS. 
So maybe it depends on the pitcher. Especially when thrown at close range.
Priceless
@ayanbh7 hahaha...
What about the Bible saying "being gay is a sin"
Unless it is thrown by an Evangelical...
.@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @DonaldJTrumpJr @MrsVanessaTrump
If the bible all of a sudden comes 100% accurate because of a sudden range than you, my father god, should indeed go to psyciathrs and schrimps and get treated for years by many of them for a anger management and get courses
It is not normal too change behaviour and a personality and attitude so fast,sir maaskoot,the old testament is out of the way and the New testament is in the New way,it is the only way,and also,i read between the lines how people use they word and they action
If the bible is all of a sudden 100% accurate when the range comes in than you should seek a psyciathris and a schrimps, sir father god, and start taking courses and threatments in anger management and get yourself some good pills too get well again
Solid use of the bible
You... How you dare

Gonna throw a bible at u to get u moving
If u are god, then why do u take urself so highly and tidy,why get pissed off so fast?in you're own image are we people created,you don’t like yourself that much,then why even create us?u make fun of you're own creatures/creations and they all make fun of u
Some things, many things are whipped out from the bible, and the bible have been on earth for longer then 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ did come many millions of years ago and it's speaks about all sins forgiven and shown mercy for
DemiGod is 100% inaccurate.

Is it true you can create a black hole once it’s made contact with the person your throwing it at?

Good night god
I’m forced into thinking of “Moaning Myrtle” from Harry Potter.
I think The Old Testament is likely far more accurate (and painful)!
You are Almighty Allah for sure!!

Allahu Akbar!!
Allah can fuck himself, Allahu akbar Allahu kheyr, he is very handsome and sexy and beautifull, so he Would not mind on doing it in all ways theyr is, right?

So you used your power to  impregnate a virgin while she was sleeping. Are you Bill Cosby?
Ouch!!
Now I understand the purpose of hardcover copies in the hotel rooms. Moses was quite a proactive personality.

With practice the range can be increased....
You may omniscient, but you don't know how bad i am at throwing.
It is the best use for that insane book
Funny and sober!
Why do you take everything so literally?

Got to accept it, God is a genius 
This is the funniest thing I read today.  Two Thumbs Up, ToG!
@AliDawow can u say same abt Kuran! 
NO, COZ IT'S Allah's word...he wrote everyword. ...Mohammad was perfect! Nothing can b beyond...applicable in all times.
Cmon...he was just a messenger!
It's was wrote after his death by commoners.
Apply ur mind !
Finally! A chance to use this gif!
Bible
On hit: (2d6+strength) points of bludgeoning damage.
On critical: deals an additional 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage plus 2d8 points of holy damage.
You're wrong "The Bible" is a magical weapon it also deals -1 intelligence on hit, check the game's wiki for God's sake. #Sarcasm
You're right. I totally forgot about the stat damage to intelligence!

That's no joke if you knew Mrs Thompson, my English teacher, she made the nose bleed of a 12 yr old boy that sat behind me in her class.  I'm just grateful her hearing was no way near as good as her aim....else I'd now be able to smell around corners too !


Someone should invent a bible canon, similar to one used for t-shirts.
It's called an AR-15 to many people.
How about the Quran? Is it also accurate? If you throw it you’ll be beheaded. LOL!

When my mom was in high school, this guy was trying to get her attention, idiot threw a Bible he had at her, hit her in the neck. The guys she was talking to kicked his ass 
New Testament is the original fan fiction. Been saying it for years.
No it is not and we all know it, the old bible is old and have 60 books too read, i have read it, some i did like but it was too much war and crime in it, the new one have many books too
Even the KJV?

That's funny.  You should become a comedian.
