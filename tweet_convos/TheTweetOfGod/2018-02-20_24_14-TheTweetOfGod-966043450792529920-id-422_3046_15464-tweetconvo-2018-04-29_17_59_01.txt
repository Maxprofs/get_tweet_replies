I am atheist, I beg to differ.
I’d agree with you except atheism is not a religion. 
Both of you are wrong. Atheism is a believe as any religion, so it’s also wrong...
Atheism is not a religion. It’s not a belief. It’s a lack of belief. 
Well said
Thanks. I just wish more people understood. 
Of course is a belief! Is the belief that there isn’t a God. That there must be another way of explaining existence, even if we don’t know how. And the same as any religion, atheism can’t proof their bases.
Then which is the correct one??
None of them. That is the point.
To criticize one's religion, we should study about it perfectly
It’s been studied. All of them. For DECADES. By people with far more degrees than you or I. And it’s been proven: religious books are fantasy stories mixed in with historical figures, written by man to control man.
Did I studied?if so which ones??
It doesn’t matter what us with our limited education has studied. SCHOLARS have studied EVERY book and come to this conclusion. The Bible, the Quran, etc. Just because you aren’t educated in it doesn’t make their facts incorrect. Facts are facts, and religious books are bull.
Please search about the scientists like Dr.T.V.N.persaud and Dr.E.Marshall Johnson
Look what they tells about Quran
I did. They have no evidence. I’m currently looking for the female PhD who I recently watched. But all you have to do is google “is the (Bible, Quran, etc) fiction?” To get plenty of evidence.
Nope. I believe in most holy payday. 
Jesus! #tWD
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

"Do or do not, there is no try."
Apparently so do Jedi... lol
Everyone needs to start wherever they are. No matter. That’s a absolute.
heheheh, nope.

There're more stars (like sun) in the universe than all grain of sand on the earth. Compare to entire cosmos we human insignificant. Earth is a speck of dust in vast cosmos. HUMAN MIND THINKING ABOUT EXISTENCE OF GOD IS LIKE AMOEBA & BACTERIA THINKING ABOUT THEORY OF RELATIVITY .
then why do you believe it? contradiction
Because GOD exists. we, human aren't anything special. something we can't comprehend that doesn't mean that doesn't exist. like Twitter for other species.
Well if you are deist that's ok. I can't say god doesn't exist. But it's obvious, religions are human made.
God, since it’s baseball season, would you please bless the LA Angels? We want a win this year
How do you know what my religion is? Oh wait, you're God. My bad, I'll change it tomorrow.
Well fuck
But my religion is science
If science is your „religion“ you are NOT into science.
Hey no disrespect please, this is my religion.
Hmm...I don’t have a religion
Well I did..
Untill I said.

Nah brah
So which one should i join?
I am agnostic leaning toward atheism, but your tweets are a very compelling arguement. Humanity still may have a chance. But what's with your hands off approach to the children suffering?

I thought mormons was the correct choice? South Park said so..

What religion??
I agree.   It's the Your.   Anything.
You are Incorrect damn you God. Who sent you here? Your dad? Or your creator,the supreme engineer?
When I was around, there was no religion at all.

My religion is tacos and music.
I agree more than anything 

You started it
he made a few jokes and wrote some fun books.
you guys took it seriously.
And the books he dictated to humans contradict each other as much as Donald Trump contradicts himself.
what does obama have to do with this?

obama sucks but trump is much worse.

Thanks for the re-mind
Atheism is non-prophet organisation ;)
God, you are so smart & funny....it almost makes me want to believe that you exist on your magical cloud in the sky! Cheers!

To those that say "atheism is a belief" I would reply. "Ok, if you say so... But it is not a RELIGIOUS belief".

Thanks. For your information... 
And you are following only one person i. e.. Justin Bieber.. 
Is He your God??? 
So don't Preach!!!
But im a zen buddhist. Whats wrong with seeking interpeace and enlightenment?
I’ve been encouraging and working to help ALL of us see that independence isn’t the answer, but interdependence.  Nice reply. 

Did you just assume my religion!

It's all because of you Gd
Uh can't say bout incorrection of religion
Ahem, (not to be confused with Amen). ALL religions are incorrect. (God drops mike, leaves stage.  Promptly disappears in a puff of logic)

#JehovahsWitnesses read Luke 19:27. " 27 Moreover, bring these enemies of mine here who did not want me to become king over them and execute them in front of me." This is Jesus talking...really? Makes me see that if there really were a god he would not have his son say this.....
What's left of it...

The astounding thing is that so-called intelligent people, in the 21st century, are still discussing the invisible man!
Strange....my god thought otherwise 
Someone's a fan of Internet Comment Ettiquete
I don't want to correct god, but I think you meant to say "all"
Questios for you, are you white, or black? And what's your sexual preference. Thank you god.
Y QUIEN DIJO QUE DIOS TIENE UNA RELIGION?
My religion is non existent
You are a fraud
all religions are stupid And I mean every last pathetic one of them.
That’s quite the claim, have any proof?
I believe in the flying spaghetti monster!

Shut up, @commentiquette
hhhhhhh
Why do you test us so, oh Lord?!
So satanism is correct, knew being Jewish was wrong
As an atheist, I’m unsure what to do with this information. Should I switch to a different style of utter lack of religion, like evangelical @realDonaldTrump voters did?
Religion is incorrect
Are you trying to cause trouble again? Enough now, look at the mess you already made by letting them split the atom.
Then what's right now?
All religions R
there is not religion correct...
You started this problem because you gave out so many crappy instruction books.
All novels do not have perfect story 
I don't have one
So is yours

imposter! all religions are about the same believes, with a slight difference
I'll kill you God!!...... Oh , the 20th century got there first!
I gave up organized religion. True religion will bring mankind together. Organized religion is fragmentary.
There is no such thing as „true“ religion.
„Trueness“ is the greatest bullshit if it is not a refernce to something that can be proven in an experiment over and over again.
Gos a sos bay gossneck
Your religion is invalid
Is satanism correct
You're wrong Buddy
I own a T-Shirt on which it says "I don´t believe in God, I believe in Al Pacino" ....but now, since you have your own Twitter account, I might as well change that into "I believe in God and Al Pacino" 
Hope that´s okay for you...
Your´s faithfully...
Sir ji who are you
Nooo... yours is, oh wait theirs is, no the other one is, shit I'm lost now... are any correct?? Mine is correct for sure... Atheism, no silly book or place of worship required in order to lose one's mind. 
Even God is so !

All religions are incorrect.
No im christian dont kill me

There's God, there's another  God.....which one's better? Only one way to sort this out.....

Or are they all correct?
Technically; it's your religion...

My religion is to observe Friday with beer and chips. It feels correct, so I’m gonna keep doing it. May even add the other six days to the mix so I don’t slip up.
So is your assumption!!
Well I guess I'll just have to find something else to hate strangers for then.
Everyone was one born with a religion, a Seal of religion on their Ass
Religion is always incorrect although it’s yours or mine.
Fuck yeah, I knew it, that is why I am haven't one.
Goddddd....Its high time you bring your own manual....we get confused , you know...!! Bdw Hows everything up there....We are as always in a mess , that YOU  have created ....

Nope, mine's correct and the other thousands are nonsense!
Please explain. Or were you just talking to the Catholics.
Every. Single. Religion. Is based in men controlling the masses. It’s all made http://up.Do  some research in your bible and see what the church did to control the people by taking out entire books, replacing entire interpretations with their own & getting paid for it.
Thankth Thor
So is yours :P
Really ...

God is dead
Are you equal to God

My Twitter Post religion is the one true religion because it says so right here in this Twitter Post.
Because there was never supposed to be one. 
I don't have a religion, just a certainty that you exist in some form.
I, a scientologist, am deeply offended.
So is Yours, Almighty Dotard!
Does religion have to be about the paranormal? Because i want to create one that doesnt involve woo woo. Im gonna call it the Educational and Fact, Scientific Method System! But you really have to put your mind into it! Maybe its to much to start off with what do you think?
Oh God, please change the syllabus, give us some new books. 
He did gave new books but everytime he did , a new religion came out of it.
Except "The Faith of Donald Trump."  
No God! Ats a bad God!

Yes, anything and everything is lost on you if you spell it "spaguetti". The word isn't fucking Spanish, it's Italian! 
Said the atheist
My religion is that anyone should become rich. So join up with Stratton or be a fucking coward and stay in the gutters. Even god can't fucking stop me
God, I believe in you an infinitesimal amount more than I do this guy,and honestly, I don't believe in you at all. (is that a prayer? Is that how it works? Asking for a friend)
