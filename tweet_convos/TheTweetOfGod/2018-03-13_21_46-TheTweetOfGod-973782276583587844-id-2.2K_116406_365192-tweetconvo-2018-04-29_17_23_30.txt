I'm sure Stephen Hawkens is not thinking that now...and God wouldn't waste his time.on Twitter...he doesn't have to prove to people like you he's REAL..he knows he is.GOD BLESS!!
I'm shocked you doubt the word of God! If he is indeed all powerful a twitter account should be no problem.
You are so adorable...how quick your feathers get ruffled,..I am going out do a a long hike...in nature...what. GOD created...and if you want to believe it was science...more power to you,..mocking people like me only makes us know we get under your skin,..and as soon as I put
I think that sounds kind of like blasphemy to me. All I’m saying is I can’t prove that this is the real gods Twitter. Better safe than sorry, am I right?!


Don’t worry, when Neil DeGrasse Tyson meets you, he’ll just redefine you as a “dwarf god “.
Have a great day Paul x oh and God
God will make it a lovely day for us both Dawn  Unless he doesn't exist ? 
true, I loved the tweet at least he has a sense of humour 
Ha !........Perfect !
My point exactly
He died at 3.14 am right? #PiDay
Yo God, if you can get rid of Trump, you'll get another follower, (but only on Twitter) 
X2
LOL. Indeed sir...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHRS01q72ic …  Sure lost some heroes in last 4 years
So metafunny
Surely him saying it to God's face would prove he's real... Cuz he's telling him...? No? Idk  #ripStephenHawking
You never fail to amuse me
I'm right though?

Haha excellent 
I don’t think it gets better than this.
I thought God lived in the White House. At least he thinks he does.
Stephen Hawking doesn't have the last word on what does or doesn't exist.
For sure Charles.
Condolences to his family on the passing of  Stephen Hawking.
I believe god exists but not you it's trump 
Then we're really fckd.
he didn’t prove you don’t exist ...he just believes it.
What do you expect when this happens?!
“God is dead.” -Nietzsche
“Nietzsche is dead.” -God
Made me laugh!!!!
But stay a little while longer, I need the laugh! And, do your job, kick out the cheetos! Oh, yeah, forgot the "you don't exist" part!

How do you know? Parallel universe?

@uh_oh_spagetios best stephen hawking tweet
Well my day starts with a loud laugh thank you for that
I'm picturing him healthy and freely traversing the Galaxy. Fly Stephen, Fly
Ok send him back to earth but please with a new functional body
I thought Douglas Adams did that.

"Lulu, Had lunch at Paradise Cove a few years ago & Stephen Hawking was in the next booth. It was an honor just to breathe the same air

Wow!!! How amazing!! 
"Yes & I literally walked on air for many days after. Really thrilling.
Think about it often 
@StephenHawking
@ParadiseCove

Stephen Hawking now knows he’s a fool...as all mans wisdom is folly to God! Hawking now knows truth as you shall one day! You may not fear God today; but there will come a day where you will quake with fear...
Please don’t use my retweet to promote your negative rudeness @wesdvrs. Try giving love and positivity a chance.
Truth is never rude! Might be hard to swallow at times for some people...which might make it seem like a negative; but again, it’s never rude!
I’m not going to engage any further with you on this. Talk to me about stocks anytime, but keep the convo to that.
No problem...I can respect that...peace!
Thanks !! $PLAY to the moon 
Did Haldane get an answer out of you about your inordinate fondness for beetles?
They breed well
And have a flexible (ornamentation-wise) exoskeleton.
Of course, the Flying Spaghetti Monster (Sauce Be Upon Her Meaty Balls) knows this well, but if this God character does, he sure doesn't like his minions to admit to it.
Yeah, first The Flying Teapot, then Flying Spaghetti Monster... what’s the world coming to? Next you’ll be telling me pigs fly
Given an appropriate initial trajectory, they sure do. Then they follow Newton's laws with minor tweaks from air resistance. 
Where is that #Mythbusters Chicken Cannon and a pig-shaped sabot?
They’ve been co-opted into @DExEUgov .
And Newtonian Laws are far too progressive - flatearthers have been coming up with very good policies
Oh boy I bet the two of you larfed (hysterically) How lucky to have someone with such quick wit, however do you manage to get work done.x
This was not for the tweet of god-don't know what happened? - weird though uh?it was for AT xx

Mr. Hawking once sang on a Pink Floyd song; an album named “The Division Bell”.

@lemelancholie he was a self confessed agnostic, not an atheist
@_zoeyag
wouldn’t have thought it would even take an hour. The power of science is always more positive and upstanding that some archaic mythological beliefs based on superstition and ignorance.                P.s. hail ZEUS. King of the immortals...

Indifference is the mark of a true atheist. 

Anything else is sour grapes.
He died on Einstein's bday. There is a god.
@andersonG1994 
To be fair though the babel fish was a bit of a give away.
@jmrose27
Relax Lord @TheTweetOfGod I RE-Proved your Existence! It's just a sad state that the World either A) Can't Read Books Anymore B) Can't Afford to BUY and OWN Books C) Don't care to prove to THEMSELVES GOD(S) Exist! So Far met 7 #ELOHIM is PLURAL for GOD(S) https://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00PUVY1AE

And there you have it.... RIP Steven Hawking
Okay close Twitter, there will never be a funnier tweet than this 
This is awful. Now trump is the only one left that can explain quantum theory.
Come on.  Douglas Adams did that already. 
Well then who's writing these tweets 
@rickygervais will love that one
The Babel Fish Conjecture.
God....you rock!!!!
Send him back and we’ll introduce himself m to Sachin Tendulkar.
@jeffpearlman From hell.
Beautiful, absolutely beautiful tweet. Say hi to him from me. 

 how do you tweet, then?

I know your account is hacked by him, nice try Stephen.
Oops
Bawhahahhaha! Thank you, thank you so much. 
Now you'll realise the actual art of making humans :-)
Geographically you are right historically
Also iternational delirium day
Or so you think, pizza eater.

But he proved it “to your face”? 
I wouldn't worry, G. He was always going around proving mathematically that various people didn't exist. He was funny like that.
 RIP
Have you sent him out back to play with Chris Hitchens?
@Gachaguaken
Forgive him for he doesn’t know what he’s doing!
#StephenHawking
Best yet.
And thus you “vanished in a puff of logic...” (HHGTTG)
You've been exposed finally!
Ha @JeffBeck11
That's just the sweetest and funniest tribute!
@leomeaney iconic
He also believed in the multiverse. Which is as theoretical as the belief in god. So either you know nothing about Stephen Hawking or ur mom gay
god mom gay

Dear God, it's not a problem. We're just getting stuck into the Quantum of things - and we've just realized something can exist & not exist at the same time. So, you're covered  Everything's fine Speak to you on Sunday again, just like last week 
I've been shown evidence that I don't exist, and frankly, it's pretty compelling. #CogitoErgoNonSum
Well, I will be jolly peeved if I ever find out I don't exist - after the hassles, worries, loneliness, shifts, sleepless nights, abuse from the public, being wronged, being smeared, colds & coughs - AND stubbed toes - it just wouldn't be fair... 
Bwhahaha 
Sure wish you were right.

"and, Hawking, I WAS that big bang"
But u do...
Why did you create me, Cthulhu, please tell me again.
Haha classic 
Is he coming for me too?
https://youtu.be/9nUo1x11w28  jay hind
You don´t. You are just an illusion.
Makes me sad that he rejected the most beautiful relationship and greatest love he could ever know! 
@nothingdood
Damn numbers and science-bring on the metaphysical - i don't exist therefore am I?xx
I love a deity with a sense of humor!
Maths flawed
Using logic to prove God doesn't exist is like using google maps to prove Earth is flat.
Courage. He could probably prove I don't, either.
If You really did exist, and were this funny, I might even consider going to heaven one day
@Gundesen00
Bummer huh?
@BlazeHazardouss
Has he told the one about the cops arresting NaCl for assault?
Lol 
one of the many reasons I love You and all Your creations - you still have agreat sense of humour x
@Chels_Millward I knew it
@ntbolton did you see this? 
@TomPocklington
But..but wait..how..you're..
Stephen Hawking is that you?
@HeatherHastie
I think no one should share such bullshits and like such pages...
Better stop tweeting then.
hahahahahahhaha
Sometimes the truth hurts.
Lol. Good for him xx
@mikealiii
@carlcollins1979
@JamesClarkRoss
As I said in a earlier tweet on the passing of Stephen Hawking, " I suddenly feel less human". Amen.
He’s just so smart.
Well just withdraw being his uncaused cause and *he’ll* cease to exist. Simples.

@AlocinDoc
@xLGxHadouken
Douglas Adams was likely first. 

But, says Man, the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and vanishes in a puff of logic.
@CraigChecketts
@FriendOfNickyG @Jsmoore64 @TrooperSF LOL
You just got a great guy. We already miss him 
@rogerwilko @VLVANCE @petersantana @rickygervais #atheism #ronreaganjr
Anyone denying existence of GOD... With so many proofs around. Is sad.  Stephen hawking disappointed in this regard. Could have done better.
@ohheyitsme_ally
Wait a minute. If you don't exist, then who in the hell have I been damning my entire life?
Science and math. Didn’t you like create that or something???
Don't take it too hard.  He might've been wrong once before.
@choo_ek beautiful use of the capital “My.”
Jesus f*@king Christ people, you won't even let God have some humor.  Maybe Hawking simply forced God to reassess their part in things.  Maybe Hawkings first post earthly life goal was to steal God's smartphone.  Why you all gotta be such dicks
@rodrigoaguilar7
Now that is funny

Poke @Sansdieux
Why do you only follow justin beiber?
Neither Does Stephen; not anymore.
Don’t act like you weren’t warned.
God, for that alone, you get a follow.

Best tribute to Hawking I've seen yet.

(And when I said 'God' above, I wasn't using it as a pronoun. Sorry)
