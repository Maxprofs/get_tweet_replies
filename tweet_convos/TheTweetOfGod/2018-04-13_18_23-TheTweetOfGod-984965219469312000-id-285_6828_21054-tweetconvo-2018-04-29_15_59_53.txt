Syria strikes will go down in history as an expensive tax payer funded smoke screen to cover up the investigation on a sitting US President's extra marital affair with a porn star!
I hope this was only over Stormy. I'm more afraid of what he is protecting that is not already public.
But it was ok for clinton to delete government emails. But we are past the no?
Oh wow zero followers well here’s your ride back to Russia
Hehehehe! Love  the Dr. who reference. That deserves a follow! 
Operation Desert Stormy
Good one that
Wrong, This strike has been planned for a week, just needed to get our ships in place to support it. Try to keep up,
Did you just tell God he’s wrong? You’re going to hell buddy 
Naming your acct God does not make you God. 

His posting ignorant statements, makes him a fool
Can you prove that naming your acct God does not make you God?
Wag the Prague
Hahahaha! Good one.
Because of course we would never impeach a sitting war president.
Wanna Bet...oh wait I am not the @GOP so...won't happen but it should.
Isn’t it about time you pulled Trump’s ticket? We’re all down here just waiting...
God doesn't want tRUmp either. So we are S.O.L.
@s8n ? Don’t you have a pit you can throw him in?
Satan isn't answering.
@s8n answers all prayers. May not be the answer you wanna hear... wait. That’s the other guy, right? I get them confused.

Fire marshal must have got to @s8n, Hell is at max capacity, no room for Trump’s ego.

Goddammit.......
Technically, He just did.
Wag the Dog
That

is some excellant waggin' !!
excellent
chemical attacks aren't comedy.
The ignorance of the people IS comedy. And if we don't have comedy in the worst of times, we have total darkness.
I’m sorry, that was just so beautifully said.  @richdavis1
Some would say that is blasphemous, I'll add to that, funny too, because you know God has a sense of humour, just look at Donald Trumps hair.
Allies will defiantly kill more civilians in revenge that Syria might have used chemical weapons against civilians 
Mos def
@darth

Dictators start wars to distract from their crimes. Sad.
Are you saying they're a smokescreen to take attention away from that?
I'm saying that starting a war, essentially with Russia who promised to strike America, is a good distraction from the fact that Trump is in a LOT of trouble.
Ok. Wd be true to form.
Unnecessary distraction, though. The yodeling kid is already at Coachella.
tRump is using this evi approach to distract from his evil behavior. Unfortunately many will have to suffer because he refuses to take responsibility. This is the price we pay for a man who has never suffered consequences because  others have been afraid to hold him accountable.

Nice one!

Ahaha!
When in doubt, leave it to @TheTweetOfGod to filter through the BS 
This is distilled BS.

The Syrian attack is globalist BS. There were reports of Syria preparing for a fake gas attack. The internet is full of fake victim photos and videos. There is no reason Assad would risk winning his very long civil war by doing something this stupid. Yes this is BS

I’m guessing all of those innocent people dying from chemical weapons is a distraction too? 
Or just like last time this happened the rebels did it and blamed Assad regime
Next time don't give free will out willy nilly.
Can I give free wily out ?
Second most disappointing porno ever. Next to Die Hard 
 Pacific Rim was another that failed to deliver
Never saw it and Octopussy just did sound my thing 
From a cute animal perspective.
Not to mention Trump's stupid (or intended, if it was Putin's plan) tweet that we were suddenly pulling out of Syria, only to follow up with tweets signaling when he planned to strike them so they could move all their most dangerous & expensive weaponry by the time he did strike.
JUST ANOTHER NEOCON WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Exactly.

so brilliant!

God sees Trump's true heart.
It formerly belonged to the Wicked Witch of the West

Don't know who he is but I am guessing he's a politician?

You called it, God!

Looks like we're launching an attack on Syria.   In Syria it smells like gun powder, explosives, and destruction.   At Lee Greenwood's house, it smells like money, as he sits by the phone and waits on the GOP to call him up to sing that damn song.  #TrumpRussia #Resist
Funny how at 9:39PM EST only @FoxNews is showing footage of US jets taking off! Really?
God, damn right!

Omg stop it god. I swear to god. My stomach hurts from laughing god damn it. Oh jesus I’m ok now god
Asi si; con traduccion incorporada q bien, ya subio mi moral

Hey! Children were killed. 
We must act! We must kill more children. You know, because we have the moral high ground.
From what I watched, they are striking military installations
These targets are in populated areas. I shat my pants when CNN said that there will be disinformation campaigns and not to believe in civilian casualties or that nerve gas escaped from explosions. The pentagon has taken over the media.
Ok, if you say so.
In times of war, all TV is State TV. 
It’s all F—-ed up when Fox TV says that we need to stop going to war but neocon liberal media is banging war drums.
trump wanted mueller, kelley said no, bolton gave him tomohawks...a compromise...
Desert Stormy
I’m wondering if this is a conflict of client/God privilege?
If so please let me know by striking Donald down with a huuuuge bolt of lightning.
Devine insight.
Amen!
I'm just glad to have woken up on a beautiful, sunny Saturday morning knowing Pooty didn't nuke Norfolk Naval Base 20 miles away.  Thanks God.
God I pray that you smite the fingers of Vladimir Putin so that he may no longer be able to push all those fucking buttons. #amen #maga
When has America bombed a country to "save " them but not offer refuge?
It's a deflection. Don't allow that to happen.
#Tweet of the day!
#Cohen's audio records are the first that were reason for a war.

#Syria
Aren't you afraid that Science will disprove you one day?
You aren't even close to God Almighty and His Will and Power! Your knowledge about what is going on is ludicrous
Amen

@POTUS
But we can see the wires.

Hey @TheTweetOfGod are you coming back because a lot of these Christians say you are . Although I thought you never left. Or is this one of Anansi Tricks?
Let the name of  Trump be stricken from every book and tablet. Stricken from every pylon and obelisk. Let the name of Trump be unheard and unspoken, erased from the memory of man, for all time.
A distraction from multiple investigations going on against trump...
If God is on our side he’ll stop the next war - Bob Dylan.
Everyone here is talking about this being some sort of distraction to a scandal (which in and of itself requires massive mental gymnastics) would also be crying foul if Trump didn't act and allowed the Syrian government to keep killing it's own people.
It is interesting to note that every US president caught in a sex scandal orders an air strike ?

The French President and British PM are also responding to the devastating attack and seizure of Cohen’s records? God you are better than this.

Short God-Quizz: This Is...A) the 3rd highest ranked design for the new Trump Wall     B) a new Syrian ‘Press’ entrance used for getting IN to the country    C) Somewhere in South Carolina ...we’ll take our response off-air, thanks
All about exposures; when Satans attack, innocents suffer and devils play at Mar a Lago- Oh Lord, deliver me, my god, strike with your Mjolnir.
Gotta wag that dog.
U mean the attack on the country of trump? Y did u not have him killed and sent to satan ages ago?
Fuck bang on.
That tail sure is waggin’ that dog
!
I have one God and it’s NOT you....blasphemous and arrogant you are.
Now wait for the retaliation from Putin. God what’s your prediction on that or you’re fucking too busy to make any good predictions
That the Orange one has to READ anything even approaching a normal human feeling is evidence that his professions of caring what happens to anyone else is just as self-serving and as much of a lie as anything else he spews out daily...but when it’s hateful, he actually means it.
This is God
.
And because of that, DJT is like Assad; ruthless, arrogant and destructive. He “saved” their innocents by putting ours in harm’s way.
#DistractionAccomplished
Well said
Haha! More fun things to come, folks! Donnie exposed
Indeed god

Indeed
Thank Dog!
You are a wise man. All efforts to distract us .
Although it was necessary to repramand a defiant child.
Sad but true.
Or nthe YouTube 2017-2018 Terms O' Services
You are a cruel and unusual God.
What Assad regiment has done and are doing to their people are horrific!
No doubt on that; but international policing historically proved to be disastrous to US. When democracy brings in unfit Presidents, who has to fix it???
Hahahahaaa!!!!
Damn...!  God... you see everything.

I love you god
lol I thought you follow your son Jesus but Justin Bieber 
I knew it God!
Spending so much money that causes people to flee their homes and yet then resent them for seeking refuge... Makes no sense
Please damn Trump. Thanks!
That one is still in the planning stage spaghetti boy
I got soul but I'm not a soldier.
How was British troops involved they were captured by the Syrian forces. FACT
You don't say Father!
this is the perfect tweet! RETWEETING
Dude, I totally said the same sh*t last night. You heard me, didn’t you, God? 
This was an exercise in military masturbation. Set us back probably hundred million dollars, and the only beneficiary was dotard in distracting and deflecting. Then to add insult to injury, mission accomplished crap.
God, You are both "en Fuego" AND (apologies to former ESPN host Dan Patrick) "el fuego."
bombs away!
Amen
@SusanMo16993439 
No matter what happens, Trump takes it personally and acts accordingly.
I hope he never sees the movie, "Wag The Dog".
Trump staff: HIDE IT!
what about the children God?
Trump/Napoleon
I would ask you to help us all, but you’ve been absent for the last 2000 years. So I doubt you’ll come through now
Sheena Easton's greatest hits, Barry Manilow et al...
Yup. That totally explains Macron’s motives
Not only ridiculous, but believe me when I tell you, you’re disrespect for GOD isn’t going unnoticed Try naming yourself something more appropriate, like BUD.
Dump thinks we are stupid, but this is basically an expensive diversion.
Yep
i miss him :( i remember when giexu beside me...i like everything christ bring come to me it is glory as i before...but choose christ my father can die i see
God knows that’s true.
Nahhh you got suckered in...not that hard to see
For the first time ever, I believe God. They're all looking for their #Falklands moment #SyriaStrike 

Right, so does anyone have a tip for the #GrandNational ?  It may be my last!!
Be nice to the president. He had a tough night. He had to read all those long paragraphs with the big words. Boy did he struggle. I couldn't stop laughing even though it was such a serious matter. You could hear the cogs turning.
Wonder what time the doomsday clock is ticking at now 
And to deflect attention away from the protest marches in London today.

With all due disrespect, I'm wondering if you are as despicable as me. As loving God, you should express fury for all the innocent victims of the strikes.
As usual God, you are bang on the money.@realDonaldTrump
Does that include 'hallelujah' and 'marriannne'
#HouseofCardsTactics
However did you know???? ;)
God please get rid of Trump & his master Israel .
Best way of getting people to forget is start a war. That’s how #potus have done it decades. #Stormy #SyriaStrikes
EXACTLY
Who the hell is Michel Cohen when he is at home? And can be stop using the name Cohen.
So sadly true
Oh God - yee of little faith
God sees all
look around at who is cheering the strikes, both left and right, make no mistake, leverage was taken to MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENED not because of
Oh Lord, you are amazingly all knowing!!!
His objective!  Change the narrative. Goes along with his pardon of Libby
Yes God! He Trump thinks he could deflect from his #Cohen #Stormie disaster! 
God smack.
Wag the dog baby!
As the oldest/biggest conspiracy creator ever, you come up with smaller ones everybtime you don’t get something. You’re going senile. Retire.
The American people are completely complicit in this taxpayer funded atrocity.
#SyriaStrikes this isn’t funny folks. This is an ACT OF WAR AGAINST A  SOVEREIGN COUNTRY. This is even constitutional Where the fuck is Congress?
NO IT ISN'T.  Only military installations are being hit.
Are you always that intelligent?
#Amen
Remember when Trump, in response to being asked by a reporter about Putin having people killed, said something akin to "We do bad things too"? Makes one wonder.....
You’re sick
In this grim hour of a pre-warned attack from a tweet, feeling more than concerned, I read your tweet & laughed. Thx! So glad decided not to rest on the 7th day and returned to @twitter.
This
4 real
Right????
@TheTweetOfGod  You are the seer of all things indeed!! I have never believed you existed until this second! #wow
Stop it Good you're killing me. Hey, is my auntie there?
Hey Big Guy - How's about waking up the fools who have been brainwashed by the Big Orange Fool?
Does it make you feel better to call @POTUS names? Grow up.
Unfortunately, this joke.
Seconded, can we forward some lightning to his nether regions? Or do you need a quorum for that? Maybe just take the first born idiot as a warning.... I’m thinking enraged emu kick.
Look like you're tough on Russia!
“To Iran and to Russia, I ask, what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children?” Trump said.
Who rattled your cage?
nice and new and “smart!”
He is just wagging the dog but no one will forget @StormyDaniels
Life's vs records?? What sort of a precedent are you setting god?
"Precedent". Rhymes with.... lol.
#MichealCohen
I'm not God but I know something about that.
Oh God! We're happy to have you with us
That's Correct
#WagTheDog
Yesss get it god!
Right on God. You're a pretty smart fella....
Imagine that!

The FBI raided Cowen' office and now Trump is showing off the military capabilities of the USA. Distractions so we don't talk about how small is his penis
I’ve seen this movie before.  Life imitates Art. Here we go again.
Geez, you are so omniscient.
I’m feeling the 
Amen

More like the other way around. POTUS distracted from the Cohen illegal act with a crime against humanity issue.
You win the internet. Perhaps forever.
lol
