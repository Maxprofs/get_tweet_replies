I don’t get the hate. He is a genius. Because of him porn stars are seen as more honest and trustworthy than the Leader of the Free World. That is a meteoric rise.
I see anyone working in sex industry as more honest than a politician 
At least you know what you're getting, and what the risks are.
#DontBeLikeDonald
His hands look just a bit too big. 

What have you got in store for Trump when he gets to heaven? 
Let me guess,  a harem full of porn stars 
Hahahahahahaha! !!!! Bonespurs getting to heaven. .....that's a good one.


Perfect description of the Republican Party.

You know that thing where You said You made everyone in Your own likeness... that was joke right?
I hear you God
yet again another accurate measurement done by God
So basically You, dad.
Dear God,

I’m done throwing arrows. Why can’t you throw a lightning bolt in the general direction of the Mar-a-Lago golf course?

Sincerely,

Cupid 
Dear God, you are so right.

Speaking of assholes ...why cancer and other diseases ?
@bewaremysting @iamAtheistGirl @wendybyrdm God has spoken...or at least tweeted.
And that is the absolute TRUTH!
And thus the theory of relativity in practice, Mr.god.
We call them the GOP down here
Give that Supreme Being a T-Shirt!
You’re so dry, ruthless, and sarcastic that I may have to start believing in you...
You need to read the book. You can find the answers to all of those questions. Easy to do, just read it. Adam&Eve did not get kicked out of Eden for growing up. And the reason for the flood is pretty well explained also. Just sayin
The standard model of physics does not include the Law of Conservation of Assholes
This is one of the rare moments in which I fancy to consider myself  #somesortofbeliever!
Yep,totally agree...
So Paul Ryan?
you made him dude, he's your fuckup
This is actually the most accurate description I’ve heard. It’s really difficult to express the level of asshole he is. Well done, God.
Or... you can be an arrogant f#%k like @JustinTrudeau and not give a shit about the people who voted you in who you are supposed to represent. @CBCNews
Three words God: Eden, Ark, Crucifixion . . .
Shoot the poachers.  There was one and only veerappan now there are thousands of Mari Veerappans usually followers of elected Members,  Ministers,  MPs MLAs local leaders. Talk to them at your Gun Point.
@antoinedecaunes 
UN PAR-ASSHOLE

He does tend to make others look good by comparison! Like Bush and Nixon, to name a couple!
Thank God.
Like this ?
#tRump
#Brexit
Donald Trump is like Albert Einstein, Babe Ruth and Amadeus Mozart all rolled into one, for assholedem. Asshollicity? Assholishness, probably, but that doesn't sound strong enough.
Just like @narendramodi 
Talking to the mirror again?
AMEN
Why try?
Is this a citation from the holy book?
You mean Hillary??

@RealHughJackman
Roger that.


You’ve proven that the biggest asshole to ever exist is David Javerbaum & you make Trump seem like a saint.
Yes siree, big guy
Why did U ever make this creature Trump ?? There is no way on earth that he could be of your image with that revolting face and egoistic negative energy 
Ha ha
Thanks for your recognition. Fake media will have to admit that I'm the biggest asshole that ever existed. Period.
True
Famous words from God!

Why would you delete your “cruelty movement” reply to this?
Loved your conservative comment.
Good bye.
God has no place in politics
The Black Hole.  Is that Yours, God?  And so we're particles of Your Holy Shit?

"Because I MADE you that way."

You’re making me believe in God again!
WoW ! Borrowed colorful vocabulary of modern God !

@mpksguthrie profound
As if your spambot looked enormous, I came off my pedestal, when will you,
@RickSantorum ?
Oh yeah they out there
Oh god ... you’re right.
Amen
The apocalypse is nigh
You could be an even bigger asshole by being God.
Oh no. God is a socialist!
Thanks God! I feel much better since I started following you! You’re “the shit!”
The visual is horrible! 
(considering you created billions of hideous hoomans in this world)... So, like you?
No, I take that back. To think that you're the one who brought him to life makes you even worse than him, actually.
What about ball tampooners, God?
You go God!
God is bringing the A game today!
Well thank you very much. I’ve now got the image of trump on the loo, stuck in my head. You bastard.
Being godly
True
Hahahahaha
True. You can be a liberal pretending to be a fictional character.
grow up for gods sake..!!
Pardon the pun, but @realDonaldTrump TRUMPS them all!!
You also can *have* a ginormous a$$hole and still have a smaller one than the Bloviating Yam.
Thank you for not making it a competition.
Your creation. Aren’t you proud.
This is so, so true.
You’re talking about Mike Pence...
Yea, it's like u might not be able to own a jet, yacht or hotels but still be very rich.
Truth from the almighty.
@TheTweetOfGod  you can also create gays and condemn them ina book you dictate to some dude on a mountain
Created in your likeness.
C’mon God we know this already. Give us a more inspired statement, something we can learn from
That's how I feel about Ted Cruz! Come on y'all, no one likes in Congress!
but he tends to be right more then you all mighty wind bag
He's more 'right' than Hitler.
yep
Speaking of enormous assholes. Sarah sanders told lies about the census immigration questions and all trumps base said was,  "Whats a census".
Well you would know!
Lookin at you, Gov. Romney
We mear mortals can not grasp the enormity of it.
So much wiggle room there.
I can see that.
Oh God
Yeah haha you all thought George W Bush was the bottom!
You don't have to hang from Stormy Daniels' chest to be a big boob!
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump                                        So true. That is where his kids slot in.
#Yuuuuuuuuge
stick a pipe in it lord, u created him now .....
exhibit A: Mitt Romney
At forum yesterday, Mitt Romney said he’s more rightwing than Trump on immigration: “I’m also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president. My view was these DACA kids shouldn’t all be allowed to stay in the country legally.” https://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/at-q-a-in-provo-mitt-romney-says-he-s/article_efee3320-23ac-5435-8c49-ddca54a69fe8.html …
Sweet!
When you don't have good arguments but being snowflake, you do this....

Seeing as you made us in your image, it doesn't say a lot for you does it?
So can we get a commitment that if we’re better than DJT we score entrance to heaven?
I am unconvinced
Well said
Like Rick Santorum? 
Truth!
By the way, you have close to 5 million followers. Shouldn't you have a blue check by now?
Amen
Who knew God cared about American politics this much? Can’t you make quarters appear behind ears for real?
Thanks! I was worried!
@beckyk313 lol 
One bar he raised pretty high
Hello @RickSantorum
That made me laugh out loud thx.
Ya mean Mike Pence?
Looks who’s talking..
Dear God. Kindly say something abt Pakistan ...please

This is a low bar.
That's why I believe in you God..you know everything and are all wise
YUGE
See, e.g., Mitt Romney. #sacredundergarments
Certainly looks that way from here.
