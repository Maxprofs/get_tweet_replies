Please fight against the Muslim Immigrant and Syrian Refugee ban, or you'll be responsible for THIS one.
#LNK is home to refugees from > 40 countries. They help make this city great. I hope you find this to be a helpful reminder.
Except, evidently, by the president you support?
the #MuslimBan is an unconstitutional attack on Muslims. Please speak up on this shameful EO—2018 isn't too far away.
seems to be happening all over again. What's your stance of Trump's ban?
I am a constituent, and I will not forget your silence on the EO when you are up for re-election.
You are still quiet. Shameful. Disgusting you want to talk about a zygote but not a real person. #2018
neither will your position on the #refugeeban and #muslimban. What is your position?
so please be on the right so if humanity this time and help refugees in need, in danger of similar elimination. #NoBanNoWall
stand up for what is right. Demand that the vetted refugees be allowed to come to the US. Stop the hateful rhetoric of WH.
shame on you. you don't represent me nor what america is about. how are you blind to your own hypocrisy?
your silence on the refugee ban shows that you have not only forgotten, you never comprehended what it means to remember.
since you are not fighting against #MuslimBan I highly doubt you care one bit about the victims of the #holocaust
I am still waiting and watching for you to say something....Anything.... #shame #bloodonyourhands
but you support Trump's ban of refugees?
.@SenatorFischer To truly remember, please speak often & LOUDLY about @realDonaldTrump's immoral and ineffective refugee ban. #NeverAgain
Now is no time to be silent.  History will judge you.  #NoToMuslimBan
Will you speak out against Trump's EO banning Syrian refugees, then? If you honor the memory of Holocaust victims, you will.
how about we think about the refugees fleeing horrific conditions TODAY?? Show just a little compassion as our leader
we had a horror seen this weekend at our airports and you are still silent! This man has to go and go fast!
So still no comment on the #MuslimBan...Should we start to wonder if you are racist like Trump, Bannon, Flynn etc.?
What is your Muslim ban if you support the acceptance of refugee? I'd like to fill you in. Silence is a response.
And where are you now to speak out against the illegal ban that has been ordered & stating the judicial dept cannot overrule
still keeping radio silence?Too busy internally debating #DeVos and #Sessions vote?All 3 should be easy decisions.Stand Up!
If you truly believe the holocaust should never be forgotten, please voice your opposition to the Muslim ban. Don't stay silent.
Your silence during the last 36 hours is disturbing. Time to stand up and be a Senator.
stop being SILENT and do your damn job! Stand up Trump and DO what's right!
meanwhile, Orange Hitler signs unconstitutional ban, but not for places he violates #EmolumentsClause. and you're silent.
so you are against the muslim ban then?
You didn't stand up for women when it mattered, I doubt you'll do the right thing for immigrants & refugees.Prove me wrong.
Interesting how @realDonaldTrump failed to Jews in this remembrance. What is he hoping to forget?
it's about to happen right under your nose. What's wrong with u people. Read up on Hitler's rise to power
And yet your silence on Trump's refugee ban makes me think this tweet is just empty words.
neither will the horror or the people we turned away. #NoBanNoWall #speakout #silenceequalsconsent
The immigration ban on this day is disgusting. The selection of countries are those w/o Trump inv $. Very Bad! Sad!
please stand against the refugee ban. We must not let history repeats itself!
where is your voice on the Muslim ban? Your silence makes you complicit. These are not our values!
- The horror of the Holocaust will never be forgotten. #HolocaustRemembranceDay #MuslimBan #NeverForget #RefugeesWelcome
seems you forgot
except when it comes to #Muslims. Grow a conscience. #MusilBan #DumpTrump
what is your position on #MuslimBan
Especially with such potent reminders you, #GOP & @realDonaldTrump are giving us.
And as a member of the GOP the horrors of the Trump regime are your responsibility. History will not absolve him OR you.
seems like you forgot already and your silence on the #muslimban is notes
Stand up to Trump's ban! It doesn't ban terrorists. It bans today's Anne Frank.
The countries that Trump and Pence have banned immigration from – none of those immigrant have committed terrorist acts.
it is quite ironic Trump signed the Muslim ban on the day of remembrance. Signals a new Holocaust. Watching it happen now.
Nebraskans: Contact this idiot who supports @realDonaldTrump and his Anti-American policies: http://www.fischer.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact …
what's your opinion on theMuslim ban?
Please stand with @SenSasse and condemn the immigration EO. Constituent in Lincoln.
if you state "never forgotten" yet support Trump on ban, then you are just as guilty as the Nazi SS w/victims of Holocaust.
Then why is it happening again in America right now? We elected you & you need to stand as a line of defense to protect the us from trump
Many Jews wanted to come to US, but were prevented. Are you standing with @realDonaldTrump today? Re-election in 2018...
stand up for Humans Rights and dignity. SAY AND DO SOMETHING!!!!
so we ban refugees?
ironic that on #HolocaustRemembranceDay Trump's exec order bans refugees fleeing to the US. Are you going to act?
Please speak out and do something about Trump's ban on refugees. It is unAmerican. Families are being separated. Please.
.@SenatorFischer stand up against Trump's religious persecution of muslims then.
remember the holocaust by not repeating it. History is repeating itself by turning our backs of refugees and banning muslims
It IS being forgotten as refugees fleeing their own deaths are being turned away by ExecOrder. NE hosts refugees. STOP THIS.
In light of #Holocaustrememberanceday: What are you going to do to counter POTUS' unconstitutional #MuslimBan?
Jewish refugees were turned away from US & sent back to death camps. Have we learned nothing?Please oppose DT's refugee ban!
As a Jewish constituent, I hope this means you'll prevent history from repeating itself by condemning the exec. order
It is disgusting that you are quiet. The blood of the next war and or terrorist attack is on our hands.
time to be a leader Senator, you're country needs you to stand up to this fascist
Does this mean you will speak out against the Muslim EO? If not, remove this tweet. I am a constituent in 68516. #MuslimBan
then how can you allow Trump to repeat the mistakes that led to it?
Oh really? How does this square with your right to life values?
This the same day as the Muslim Ban signed. You are a hypocrit. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/refugees-detained-at-us-airports-prompting-legal-challenges-to-trumps-immigration-order.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur …
If you stand up for those who were murdered in the Holocaust you cannot stand with Trump’s executive order. Speak out.
and neither will this:
Please speak out against the EO banning refugees. This is un-American
remember but also prevent! Stand up for what's right and condemn Trump's religious-based refugee ban EO. Children will die.
I WILL NOT ASSIST SUICIDE. NEITHER CAN I STOP JIM JONES OR KORESH DIRECTLY. IT'S PRES BUSH N CIA'S CALL!
and on this day we started a Muslim ban... your leader is pathetic
Will you speak out against Trump's EO banning Syrian refugees, then? If you honor the memory of Holocaust victims, you will.
.@SenatorFischer Highlights how imperative it is that particular groups of people, i.e. Muslims, not be scapegoated.
don't vote for DeVos
except by Trump and his cabinet
you corrected your meme. you're welcome (must have missed your gratitude and saying 'thank you' like i teach my son to do)
Then why is Bannon in the White House?
