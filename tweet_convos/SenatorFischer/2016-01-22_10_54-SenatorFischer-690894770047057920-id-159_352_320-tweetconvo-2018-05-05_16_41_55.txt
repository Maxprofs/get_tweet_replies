@SpeakerRyan this music is terrible. holy hell.
@alwaysonoffense Coming from someone that enjoys K-pop. @SpeakerRyan
@seanagnew @SpeakerRyan i'm having second thoughts about ryan as speaker.
@alwaysonoffense Well, you're a Trump supporter, so.. @SpeakerRyan
@seanagnew @SpeakerRyan if ryan was still ways & means chair, he wouldn't have power to torture us with this music, but nooooooo
@alwaysonoffense then we would have Boehner playing traditional Irish music and we know where that leads.. Tissues. @SpeakerRyan

@alwaysonoffense Worth noting. You're the only one complaining. You're in the minority. Go sit with the Dems. @SpeakerRyan
@SpeakerRyan The President wants a legacy, he would jump through hoops to get a budget.  You are too stupid to realize that.
, @SpeakerRyan snow jam fan
@SpeakerRyan
@SpeakerRyan and another example of wasteful government spending.  if nothing else, isnt the Capitol's electric bill high enough.
@SpeakerRyan another example of @speakerryan talking the talk but not walking the walk.

@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan is teaching a course, How to Make YOURSELF WORTHLESS.  By giving away the Budget to the Democrats.
@SpeakerRyan Screw the people who support you and then try to cover your ass.  Paul Ryan, everything that is wrong with politicians.

@SpeakerRyan @ellakpauly please enjoy is the most ridiculous thing I've seen in a while :)
@SpeakerRyan watching snow fall is probably less frustrating than watching Congress.
@SpeakerRyan pleasantly surprised that you apparently enjoy EDM music.
@SpeakerRyan Hello shirt tail relly.
@SpeakerRyan How 'bout a song credit in the description? I'm sure the original artist would appreciate a shout out.
@SpeakerRyan wusay for yourself  

Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan & Kevin McCarthy: Plot
@SpeakerRyan Or maybe he's getting in touch with his Irish roots #Dubliners #JamesJoyce
@FoxNews  Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed and Hillary raised approximately $500,000 by pandering to Muslims! How much did @SpeakerRyan get
@SpeakerRyan Man-up!!
@SpeakerRyan what's the music track source? Nice.
@SpeakerRyan Great use of tax payer supplied bandwidth.  But gov spending has never been a big concern of yours.
@SpeakerRyan What is the backing track music, please?
@SpeakerRyan So now we have to pay for your streaming privileges in addition to you mailing privileges?
Are taxpayers funding @SpeakerRyan's days-long live stream of falling snow??? #blizzard2016 #weather
RT @SpeakerRyan Follow me on SoundCloud, fam. #blizzard2016
@SpeakerRyan Please tell us what the song is - we are dying to know!!!!!!!!!! #SpeakersDanceFloor #snowday
@SpeakerRyan @SarahPalinLinks Cool! We can actually watch you screw us?
@SpeakerRyan since you're stuck inside your office, i expect you'll work HARD on behalf of your constituents, eh buddy? be nice 4 a change
@SpeakerRyan @MPRnews um.........
@SpeakerRyan @jillbader very cool "live" #postcard from #DC
@SpeakerRyan Are you finding warm places for our homeless Veterans?
@alafiadelight @SpeakerRyan I worked by White House, many homeless vets, looked after by charities in this weather
@stevendrowe @SpeakerRyan Shameful our Gov't treats Veterans like garbage! Yet cares for illegals & refugees.
@alafiadelight @SpeakerRyan many conservative staffers on my DC bus who treated/spoke of vet homeless as though they were trash, shameful.
@SpeakerRyan That is some comfy tune. 
(´〜｀*) zzz
@SpeakerRyan @slone Wow! Beautiful view!
@SpeakerRyan Does it remind you of home Paul?
@SpeakerRyan @instapundit Soundtrack is vaguely pornish -- do I'm told.
@SpeakerRyan  you're wasting my tax dollars on live streaming the weather?
Nice idea, but less interesting than the Yule log.  (I haven't listened to the accompanying music.) @SpeakerRyan
sorry @SpeakerRyan we're too busy dealing with the bad deal you signed with #omnibus to worry about snow. Way to screw base.
@instapundit
@SpeakerRyan okay well done!
@SpeakerRyan Thanks for that Speaker, it's sunny & 60 here
@SpeakerRyan @kairyssdal I really hope this isn't a sarcastic dig at climate change. I'm going to believe that it isn't.
@SpeakerRyan what is the music that you're playing on Snowfall at the Capitol - LIVE i must know YOU MUST TELL ME
@ASeabrook36 I found music. Liam Aidan - Gold Skies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwSoG8R_aUY …
@SpeakerRyan Nice!! I hope that the snow won't bury the city!
@SpeakerRyan Do the country a favor take a snow week. We would be much better off. Did u work 3 days this week. What a joke
@SpeakerRyan  I have waited so long for your vision & voice. PLEASE don't fall into their trap. You & Trump ARE the future both hand In hand
@SpeakerRyan the decay, more importantly THE RINO DECAY in DC - Burn it down!  Take down these imposters of the people!
@SpeakerRyan #AltarBoyRyan - Are taxpayers paying for your silly activities?
@SpeakerRyan the music is awesome lol
@SpeakerRyan Heard DC central target of storm. Brrrr!! Stay warm!
@SpeakerRyan @EricHolthaus I would have loved to hear the conversation that made this livestream happen (h/t @TessVanden)
@SpeakerRyan Love the shot but that music is really bad.  @mis2127 help!
@SpeakerRyan So, that's all that the Speaker has to do I guess....
@SpeakerRyan Wow that's awesome we will FINALLY see action in the Capitol
@SpeakerRyan WTF, your spending taxpayer dollars to let people watch snow falling? 

@GOP, the clown car that needs it's tires deflated.
@SpeakerRyan This is the most productive thing to come from the Republicans in the last 8 years. I was hoping you were going to change that.
@SpeakerRyan who's got the tequila?!!
@SpeakerRyan I really hope y'all are paying attention cause we are...$80 million to Lynch=No Burr from North Carolina=His done...no reelect!
@SpeakerRyan your streaming is like a polluted river nothing but toxin for the average citizen Try drinking your own water
@SpeakerRyan what's this track?
@SpeakerRyan That's great,y dont u get to work & START fullfilling ur promises!
@SpeakerRyan Mr. Speaker, did you pick the soundtrack, or did a staffer?
@SpeakerRyan heaven forbid sandy come back..
@SpeakerRyan omg! Snowmaggeddon!
@SpeakerRyan thank you!
@SpeakerRyan 

You'v been snowing us since you took High Command.  This time God made initial repayment.  Voters will pay off the balance.
@akirchstein @SpeakerRyan OMG yes it's like I'm there with him 
@SpeakerRyan BREAKING NEWS: DC government offices shut down. More snow please. !!!!
@SpeakerRyan @EricHolthaus somebody needs to be educated about the horrors of auto-play music on websites (and bad music at that!)
@SpeakerRyan @kairyssdal Best thing to ever come from that office. This is not why you were sent there. You could watch snow fall back in WI
@SpeakerRyan "oh, look, speaker ryan wants to share the snow with us...WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MUSIC OMG" 

*mutes* 

"much better"
@SpeakerRyan If this is your snowed in music, what do you play when the weather is good?
@Eugene_Scott @SpeakerRyan https://youtu.be/2nXGPZaTKik 
.@speakerryan dude...what's with the elevator music. Shouldn't there be viking music?
@SpeakerRyan Bundle up PR!!
@SpeakerRyan @kairyssdal Nice...but the music???
What's the story with the music? Reminds me of Tracks circa 1984 @SpeakerRyan
@mikeviqueira @SpeakerRyan omg, a Tracks reference. That's old school!

@SpeakerRyan This is great, love the music!
@SpeakerRyan SHU!T UP
@SpeakerRyan Not a crisis for someone from WI!  We had at least 5 big one's last year.  Safe home!
@SpeakerRyan Better clear a path to Tortilla Coast.
@SpeakerRyan @nielslesniewski  #DC Snow with Cool music!  lol
@SpeakerRyan Judges 9:8-15 (NIV) Donald thornbush. Donald the king of the GOP?
@SpeakerRyan very cool
@SpeakerRyan   I guess watching it snow in DC is better than watching Congress giving away Our Country
@SpeakerRyan Rome burns while Paul plays the fiddle.
@SpeakerRyan FYI
