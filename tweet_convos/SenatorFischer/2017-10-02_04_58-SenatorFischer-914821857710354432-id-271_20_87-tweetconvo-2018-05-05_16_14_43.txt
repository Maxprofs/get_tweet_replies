Thinking and praying isn't gonna do a damn thing Fish. Do something about it for Christ's sake
Dude chill...
Nah I'm good, tired of elected officials sending "thoughts and prayers" but won't do anything to help prevent. All talk, beholden to the NRA
Yeah dude, chill. I mean it's not like people are dying or anything 
Exactly,people died. Not everything's politics.let's mourn for a minute, find out the facts. People have died with Left and Right in office.
The facts. 1 man.  10 +guns. 50+ dead.  500+ injured.  It’s time for some common sense gun laws. NOW is the time to talk about it.
Wasn’t being rude man. Just stating some facts. The ones you wanted. Didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.

#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You continue to vote Nay on prohibiting the sale of automatic weapons, prohibiting high round magazines, and background checks.
Can you please explain your views on gun control inlight of the recent events in las vegas and the numerous mass shootings across the U.S.?
we're effing tired of words .... you're a legislator--legislate
And how about you also get to work on sensible #guncontrol legislation?
#LasVagasShooting #GunControlNow
You prayed for these too ... so what else will you do?  Prevention??

Show the victims and their families that you actually care. Vote NO on the #shareact.
What is more important? People's lives or you getting gun $$ from NRA? Oh, wait, we know that answer already. YOU contributed to massacre.
Your voting record on SAmdt 2910, SAmdt 4750, SAmdt 711, SAmdt 714, SAmdt 715, and letters against theATF show you voted against gun control
I bet the 14960$ from the NRA will keep you from doing something to prevent the next mass shooting? Guess everyone has his/her price...
Then PLEASE do some gun control and protect Americans Health Care!!!
Do something about it then. Stop listening to the NRA.
What are you going to do to stop this? You could propose legislation to limit ammunition if nothing else. Your mourning gets us nowhere.
Stop voting in support of the NRA. That's what you can do.
It is horrible isn't it? If only there were some politician we could turn to who could influence the availability of these automatic weapons
The moment you took money from the NRA, you became part of the problem. How can you live with their blood on your hands?

Now show you care by helping to enact stricter gun laws, not do away with guns, just do away with massacres like this. Their blood is on you
What will you do to make possession of weapons like those used in Las Vegas a felony? When will you stand up to the gun lobby and the NRA?

When will you make your stmt denouncing @NRA & their purchase of your support for their platform, including the push for sale of silencers?
Don't just pray, use your position to DO SOMETHING. We need common sense gun laws now, and for you to #SendBacktheBloodMoney
Mourning the loss of @SenatorFischer's moral standards, as she passes out of the senate seat due to lack of votes in her favor.
POLICY CHANGE OVER BLOOD MONEY
Try action like preventing those type of weapons in our country- that will do more good thN prayers and thoughts
How much did you take from NRA? $15k?!Right...got it. Tweet does not equal ACTION. #FAIL
How does that cold cash feel in your pocket? Spend wisely #VoteNoGOP! 
#GunControlNow 
#StopNRA
PIG
But hey, silencers are cool, right?
I approve silencers for #thoughtsandprayers hypocrites.
#GunControlNow
Can you imagine being in a position of power but not doing anything to fix the suffering? It's called cruelty.
Just stop.  Your words are empty because the NRA owns you.  Shame on you.
All those praying are those who intend to do nothing.
@nra shill.  #GunControlNow
This should have ended w/Sandy Hook. I will do better than NRA & donate $15,000 if U pass legitimate gun control. Even NRA members want it!
Oh please. You have power and do nothing. Spare me your fake sadness.
Prayers and condolences don’t stop bullets. 

Luckily, thanks to you, mentally ill can now get in on the “it’s my right to own a gun” party!
Another empty boilerplate tragedy reply.
Your regular Wednesday meeting w/ NRA lobbyist, U know the one where U get on your knees and suck them off, that cancels out your prayers.
.@senatorfischer. Say their names, Fischer.

Actions speak louder than words and your actions tell us you don’t care about the victims. So no use pretending you care. #GunContolNow
You do realize you are in a position to do something about this?
When you're done praying how bout #guncontol legislation? Or is the @NRA money worth more than those lives you're mourning? @OWHnews
you're lying. you're not mourning. and no one needs your damn prayers! #GunControlNow
Mourning the loss of those killed in this horrible Las Vegas shooting and praying for the injured.
You have power to do something more than offer your thoughts and prayers!
Send back the blood money. Send back your prayers - He hears them, and He sees your hypocrisy. Your lies will weigh you down.
You are in a position to prevent such tragedies. Please do so with legislation- not "love and prayers." Be a leader.
Thank you for promoting and exalting your prayer for the world to see. I pat you on the back.
Matt 6:6, Senator.
Insufficient again. Maybe you should start praying to God for forgiveness.

Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas @splinter_news http://ow.ly/9SsB30fAAVY 
You forgot the footnote:  paid for by the @NRA
Also, I’m mourning the loss of my ability to act on #gun control laws, because my privates are caught in an NRA money clip.
No, Deb. You're not mourning anything, considering you are part of the problem.
Send back the NRA money or all you say is pointless, shameful bullshit and lies. Empty lies.
Was it worth it, the 15 thousand of blood $$$$.
Mourning after the fact is not enough. Do something about! Is this not evidence enough to prove we need gun reform?!!!
Do more than pray for victims. Do your job and vote for gun control legislation!
Deb surely u plan on giving back the money NRA gave u to help with the victims funeral expenses and hospital bills BYH
Please do something to stop it-this is madness-this guy shot almost 600 people!
There's really no way to check whether you're actually mourning or actually praying, is there? All we know is that you said you were. Easy.
Your prayers and your mourning continue to do nothing. Try something different. Please.
Do something
Nice departure from the usual “thoughts and prayers!”
YOU ARE USELESS. Blood on YOUR hands.
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
This is on you and your support for the @NRA   #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Prayers mean nothing. Give them the money the NRA gave you to promote the weapons that killed their family members.
NRA donated 4,950$ to you. Do something about guns in our country.
We're all with you on thoughts and prayers in the wake of another tragedy. Now use your privilege of office and vote to prevent this from happening ever again. #enoughisenough #GunContolNow
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Listen - you can do so much more than pray. JUST SAY NO TO THE NRA! You know it’s the right thing to do.
Do something
You were paid to allow this insanity, you are guilty of enabling this sick murder. May you never sleep well again.
$14,970 in NRA blood money buys a lot of thoughts and prayers. Sleep tight senator.
Sucked the cock of the @NRA lately? How much for your so-called "campaign" this year, Debbie? Was it 59 bodies or more?
Liar: Your took FACT $15K from the NRA #BloodMoney  #giveitback #guncontrol #KarmaNeverForgets #vegas #TomPetty #LasVegasShooting
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
It's time to #SendBackTheBloodMoney and stop being complicit in the mass murder of American citizens
Mourn, then support sensible gun laws to help prevent tragedies like this. Stand up to the NRA & #SendBackTheBloodMoney they've given you!
Try getting off your knees and doing something to make it harder for it to happen next time.And,yes,there will be a next time.
You're only mourning the outing of the money you received supporting NRA
It's out and so shall you be.
30 pieces of silver from judas
What else are you doing? #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Mourning and praying aren't going to change things.  Banning assault rifles will.
What will you do with the $15,000 the #NRA gave you, @SenatorFischer BLOCK any attempt to control assault rifles?
"You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?" James2:20. Stop praying and do something
To honor their memory take a stand against the Silencer Bill. Otherwise, empty words Deb, devoid of honesty.
Blood is on YOUR hands
You still took money from the NRA after babies were massacred at their school. Who or what exactly are you praying to?
Does the NRA money keep you warm at night?
Fischer, prayer? Did you forget on Saturday to pray peace or did you pray more selfishly? Or, did you pray for a mass murder? Confused!
Looks like the NRA is getting its money's worth out of you! I'm sure they're very proud.
Hey Deb, How much blood is on your hands, from accepting @NRA blood money? Such hypocrisy
You praying your guilt away from the blood money you took from the NRA?
If you’re paid for by @NRA, save your empty words.
#NRATerrorist #NRABloodMoney #NRAOwnsTheGOP @NBCNews @USATODAY
Then send your #NRABloodMoney to the victims or 1st responders, you GOP hypocrite.

If #guncontrol gave you $20K, would you vote the RIGHT WAY? #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Shame on you, Senator. You could have possibly prevented this.
And verifying how much #NRA money you’ve received to know how measured your response should be.
You have bloody NRA $$ lining your bank account Debbie, you've bent over & voted away all gun laws. You are guilty & worship $$$ over life.
Blacksburg. Newtown. Aurora. Fort Hood. Charleston. Orlando. And now, Las Vegas.  Is it still to soon to talk about gun regulations?
If we want prayers we will call in the nuns.  Do your fucking job and pass sensible gun control legislation.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
The blood of all of these dead Americans is on your hands! @NRA #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Sobbing into your NRA thousands I'm sure. Praying next to your big fat check, amirite?
Sure Deb - you can send sympathy cards to all 58 victims with the money you got from the NRA.
NRA-serving politicians like you facilitate such massacres.
joins you in prayer. Send back the money, vote down the gun silencer bill #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You took almost 15 grand from the NRA! You are part of the reason these people were killed! You should be ashamed! What a hypocritical post! Shame on you!
God has given us more than we need to fix this. What other answer are you expecting?
So, will you actually do something about this, or does that @NRA $$ mean that all we get are thoughts and prayers? DO YOUR JOB FOR ONCE.
.@SenatorFischer took $14,960+ from @NRA so she'll just tweet about gun violence but won't *do* anything to stop it #SendBackTheBloodMoney
I don't believe you're truly mourning the loss until you #SendBackTheBloodMoney and cut ties with @NRA
As a Nebraskan, I can tell you the blood money you take from the NRA isn't any rational or ethical person's idea of common sense, Senator.
Pray, then ACT: The Lord said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the people to get moving! (Exodus 14:15)
.@SenatorFischer took $14,960+ from @NRA so she'll just tweet about gun violence but won't *do* anything to stop it #SendBackTheBloodMoney
How much money did you get from the NRA?
$14,960+
WE DON'T NEED PRAYERS- WE NEED GUN CONTROL!!!!!!
Put your money where your mouth is #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Hope those #NRA dollars can wipe the blood from your hands.
Isn't it pretty to think so?
On What did you spend that $15k the #nra gave you ?????

TODAY trump should issue a stop on any automatic gun and high capacity ammo until this sorted out! @realDonaldTrump makes good EO.
More fucking prayers?
No you're not liar
Hey Debbie! (Can I call you Debbie? Cool.) How about passing some legislation so this doesn't happen with such alarming regularity? Xoxo
Or ever again.
Sending back some of the NRA's $14,000+ donation would probably speak louder than perfunctory "thoughts and prayers."
Nice try. Keeping enjoying that #nra cash though.


F*ck your "prayers". DO SOMETHING. Stop taking $$ from the NRA. Blood is on your hands. #emptywords
You're a bad person
Might be time to do more than just pray, Ms. Fischer.
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, YOU GHOUL, YOU LEECH, YOU MERCHANT OF MISERY.
(2) there will never be a purpose for a civilian to have a silencer. Period. You made your bed. Now "lie" in it some more. 
How much money do you get from the NRA again?
You took $$& from NRA. So ... maybe shut the hell up. Your prayers mean NOTHING. NRA = GREED. NRA is pushing for gun silencer laws NOW. (1)
Could you work to bring some common sense gun laws to Washington?
Stop the prayers. Start the gun control
Yes it is horrible that you aid and abet the gun lobby by taking their money and failing to enact meaningful laws!
You're a disgusting accomplice in these deaths. #SendBacktheBloodMoney
Senator Fischer, will you return the $14K donation from the NRA? Or donate the sum to an anti-gun violence org?
People don’t give a f*** about your thoughts and prayers. People care about congress doing something to end this carnage. Do your job!
Until you do something to stop the carnage, you’re just an enabler.

LEGISLATE, DON'T SEND PRAYERS
Your prayers don’t do shit. How about enacting some sensible gun control legislation?
my relatives are constituents of yours, how about you do something to make this less prevalent
You took money from the gun industry.
You voted against the assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
They just needed better weapons in the crowd. Rocket launchers maybe.
What ideas do you have to help keep this from happening again?
Please act to prevent future tragedies. Don't support silencer legalization under the SHARE act. Support Universal background s, etc.
You are in a position to prevent these tragedies, but instead you accept NRA blood money and do nothing.
And what exactly do you plan to do about this besides pray and think? Because right now that is not enough.

God’s reply to “thoughts and prayers” 

"So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead." James 2:17

Thoughts and prayers are not enough.

God’s reply to “thoughts and prayers” 
are you so afraid of the gun lobby and nra that you can't do something other than "thoughts and prayers?"
Expand background checks
Remember the time after Sandy Hook when you voted against sensible gun reform? Blood is on your hands. Do something more than prayer.
Here's an idea: PUSH A DIFFERENT BUTTON
I'm so stealing this picture
You going to bring up &talk about gun control or u going to be party over country with the rest of the  @GOP
Makes no common sense at all to have weapons of mass destruction terrorizing public & add'l strain on law enforcement, first responders.
Then do something besides take NRA money, you hypocrite.
