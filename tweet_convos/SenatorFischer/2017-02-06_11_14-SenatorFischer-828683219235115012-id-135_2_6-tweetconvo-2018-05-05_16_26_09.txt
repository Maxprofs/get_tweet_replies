Thank you to the overwhelming amount of Neb people who are against DeVos! Please listen!
with your experience you really should know better regarding Devos. You can not agree this is the best
...Sullivan, Thune, Tillis, Tilley, Young. Why are none recusing themselves on her vote? #draintheswamp
Daines, Gardner, Grassley, Johnson, McCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Perdue, Portman, Rounds, Rubio, Scott..
17 of your colleagues took up to $98,300 apiece from the DeVos family: Blunt, Burr, Cassidy, Cotton...
How about RESPECTING the views of your constituents who DON'T LIKE Betsy #DeVos BUYING A CABINET POST?
@KatyTurNBC @MSNBC

this was a great interview! You sound so level headed which I really respect, but reconsider your Devos vote, Please Help US
The Senator has decided to not listen to her constituents and choose Party instead. #shameonyou
She is trying to defend Devos credentials. Lost all credibility. Another one who needs to grow a spine.
You looked like traitorous fool- unwilling to denounce your idiotic leader-shameful simply shameful!
shame on you putting party line above the best interest of school children. No common sense. #StopDeVos
you are useless
I agree that when one is first elected @POTUS he shouldn't attack leaders. He's attacked allies! OK w/U?
