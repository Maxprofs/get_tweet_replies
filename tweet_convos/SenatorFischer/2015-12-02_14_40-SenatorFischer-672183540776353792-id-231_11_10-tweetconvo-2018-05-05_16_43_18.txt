@SenatorFischer How's that NRA paycheck?
@SenatorFischer instead of praying which is USELESS you could have voted for stricter gun laws. You are a terrible person.
@SenatorFischer You don't have a heart. You only care about money. $7,950 that's what you received from the gun industry at time of voting
@SenatorFischer take public safety seriously?
@SenatorFischer How about you forward the money #NRA gave you to keep quiet on gun reform to #SanBernadino to make up for the 14 lives lost
@larsababa @SenatorFischer kind of doubt Farouq Saeed or the arabic woman are NRA members
@Women4Trump @larsababa @SenatorFischer Kind of know their firearms were purchased legally courtesy of the NRA.
@CarlaFromEarth @larsababa @SenatorFischer yup, so there goes that argument.People like you are why we've dug in our heels.
@Women4Trump @larsababa @SenatorFischer There goes that argument? You make zero sense.
@SenatorFischer what r u going to do about it? #enough #dosomething
@SenatorFischer stop thinking and praying and ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! how much money has the nra gave you to be on their side???
@SenatorFischer shame on you
@SenatorFischer Nice work on the meaningless platitudes. Take some action... do something... anything.
@SenatorFischer In memory of the public health workers who died, please vote for funding for CDC to study gun violence.
@SenatorFischer so what's your plan? Just take the money and run? Oops (gun)
@SenatorFischer Perhaps you could give the $1651 the NRA gave you to the victims families,
@DevinGoldenberg @SenatorFischer great idea!
@SenatorFischer So you acted by voting against background checks? Really?
@SenatorFischer Shameful behaviour
@SenatorFischer the god is the soul, soul is the tear of the world
@SenatorFischer / Shame one you.
@SenatorFischer do something about our gun laws!! You can help to prevent these tragedies.
@SenatorFischer
These are your hands with NRA money.
.@SenatorFischer and today you could have done something to help prevent this in the future. But you didn't. Thanks!
@SenatorFischer Please work hard to end gun violence. Put into action better gun laws and help educate gun owners. Make it as strict as DMV
@SenatorFischer please do SOMETHING to prevent future tragedies like this from happening. Your thoughts and prayers aren't enough.
@NoThanksJustin @SenatorFischer let's not use the word SHOT!
@SenatorFischer but your votes remain with @NRA.
@SenatorFischer Your prayers will do nothing to stop the madness. How about doing the opposite of what you did yesterday instead?
@SenatorFischer yet you voted against background checks. Thank you for supporting #terrorism and #ISIS keep bending over for the NRA.
@SenatorFischer My thoughts are prayers are with whoever opposes you in the next election. DO YOUR JOB. protect America. NO MORE #NRA money
@SenatorFischer Save your so-called "thoughts and prayers" Senator they're just public relations talking points. When will you and your lot
@SenatorFischer Lovely. Now, stand up for commonsense gun control legislation to address this mess. Your inaction is insane.
@SenatorFischer You could save a lot of thinking and praying time if you actually wanted to do something about gun violence.
@SenatorFischer hypocrite.  You don't even want to expand background checks.
@SenatorFischer YOU HYPOCRITE!  Your prayers are hollow!  You took money from the NRA. Their blood is on your hands!
@SenatorFischer DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
@SenatorFischer #Christian #terrorist #Muslim terrorist none of this cd happen w/out #guns, international arms sales. #USA = global leader.
@SenatorFischer then fucking do something to change it!!!!
@SenatorFischer assuming you will return the @nra campaign donations?
@SenatorFischer then give back your NRA blood money and then DO SOMETHING
@SenatorFischer Your thoughts & prayers are useless. It's past time to take action on gun control.
@SenatorFischer Those "thoughts and prayers" are not effective.
@SenatorFischer "faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead." James 2:17 NIV #gunsense #sanbernardinoshooting
@SenatorFischer shame on you
@SenatorFischer what is it with these hypocrites and their 'prayers and thoughts'?? Hear it one more time I'II throw up!!
@SenatorFischer You wouldn't want to upset your @NRA donors would you? no! that's why you only want to pray.
@SenatorFischer Substitute action for prayer.  Don't hold God responsible for your sins.
@SenatorFischer : Send the NRA blood money that's dripping from your tacky purse to the victims families, your votes killed people!
@SenatorFischer "thoughts and prayers" are useless - implement some gun regulation like we have in Australia. Tell the NRA to piss off.
@SenatorFischer : Shove the Hypocritical prayers, stop taking NRA $$$, stop voting yes for all NRA bills. Support expanded Brady bill.
@SenatorFischer Might as well get a head start praying for the victims of the next massacre you're doing nothing to prevent!
@SenatorFischer quit with the Obama care crap, and act on real gun control
@SenatorFischer I bet it's not heartbreaking enough to stop taking NRA $, you sellout!  How thinking about human lives instead of $$$$$?
@SenatorFischer More empty praying that won't help anything. #GunControlNow #NotAllMuslims
@SenatorFischer those thoughts and prayers don't stop bullets. Tell us how proud you are to take @NRA money.
@SenatorFischer the only people more evil than the ones that do the killing, are the ones that willfully allow it to happen.  Sickening!
@SenatorFischer You probably prayed a couple of days ago too. Didn't prevent this one, won't prevent the next one. Prayer isn't solution.
@SenatorFischer They don't need your prayers. They *needed* your support on gun control legislation, which you opposed. You're a hypocrite.
@SenatorFischer just sit there and think your #thoughtsandprayers while the rest of us try to do something.
@SenatorFischer Thoughts and prayers are fine, but it's not a solution. DO something. #GodIsntFixingThis #GunReformNow
@SenatorFischer We all know you're not ACTUALLY praying. That would require actual action. Not your strong suit-and it doesn't work--like u
@SenatorFischer stop taking money from the #NRA starting making laws to save our children from violence.
@SenatorFischer Seeing as your heart is finally broken by a mass shooting, are you ready to do something about #GunViolence ?
@SenatorFischer Your thoughts & prayers are not enough, since we've had 300+ mass shootings this year. I demand ACTION on  #guncontrol.
@SenatorFischer
.@SenatorFischer Platitudes won't help. Common sense #GunLaws will. Get the NRA out of ur pocket and DO SOMETHING! Ashamed of #NEpoliticians
@SenatorFischer Stick to status quo and keep cashing those NRA cheques. Or maybe just keep praying and hope that solves it? #Incompetence
@SenatorFischer stop praying and stop opposing background checks. Stop taking NRA's bribes. #SanBernardino #SanBernardinoShooting #gunsense
@Cult_Of_Freedom @SenatorFischer If you can find one proposed law that would have prevented this shooting bring it on.
@SenatorFischer Thoughts and prayers are fine, but it's not a solution. #GodIsntFixingThis #GunReformNow
@SenatorFischer When are you going to help solve this issue?
@SenatorFischer you helped make it happen, you and the NRA are to blame.
@SenatorFischer @billy98102 HOW BIG OF A CHECK DID YOU GET FROM THE NRA?
@SenatorFischer @billy98102 meaningless drivel from a meaningless driveler.  prayers DON'T DO A DAMN THING FOR ANYONE!
@SenatorFischer #thoughtsandprayers are not enough. #faithwithoutworksisdead
@SenatorFischer maybe w/ the expanded background checks you oppose there wouldn't be 31 more families to pray for tonight #BloodOnYourHands
@SenatorFischer Keep your #thoughtsandprayers unless you are praying for a government that will take action against #GunViolence
@SenatorFischer How about you pray for votes instead of campaigning for reelection? Seems fair if you REFUSE to help stop #MassShootings
@SenatorFischer I bet all that NRA blood money will heal that pain
@SenatorFischer  congress is full of cowards and you are one.  Do something meaningful to curb access to guns....then pray
@SenatorFischer
@SenatorFischer stop taking NRA money!
@SenatorFischer What's your plan to prevent more mass shootings and/or gun violence? You can't pray this problem away. #GunViolence
@SenatorFischer still ve hemently opposed to background checks? Still defending  people on the no-fly list  to buy assault weapons?
@SenatorFischer do something about it!
@SenatorFischer their blood is on your hands.
You can honor these victims by not backing violent NRA rhetoric. That'd be a good place to start. @SenatorFischer
@SenatorFischer take more blood money from the NRA. Your prayers mean nothing.
@SenatorFischer STUFF your thoughts and prayers! Your job is to ACT. The blood in the 355 mass shootings this year are on your hands.
@SenatorFischer please think and pray about doing something. Platitudes are not helpful. This is the time for action
@SenatorFischer #Enough
@SenatorFischer
@SenatorFischer your support of the NRA is heartbreaking. Think about how difficult you've made gun control during this difficult time.
@SenatorFischer Who are you kidding? Your own website states you actively support ways to get guns into the hands of terrorists legally.
@SenatorFischer Apparently, 30 pieces of silver equate to $1,651 in @NRA money. You must be so proud, right now.
@SenatorFischer You're job is to legislate, not pray.
@SenatorFischer No more thoughts and prayers. Do your damn job. #SanBernadino
@SenatorFischer What do "prayers" do to make the US safer for our children?
@SenatorFischer please send 1,651 prayers, one for each NRA dollar you got
@SenatorFischer You got money from NRA, you hypocrite.  DO something and quite bloviating.
@SenatorFischer DO SOMETHiNG #gunsense
@SenatorFischer will you back your prayers with action? Stop taking NRA money
@SenatorFischer how's the $1600 from the #NRA treating you?
@SenatorFischer next time don't take money from the NRA. Shame on you.
@SenatorFischer Do something about it! Sick of "thoughts and prayers" bullshit. That isn't passing any actually legislation!
@SenatorFischer Be a leader! Fix the damn problem!
@SenatorFischer stop with the thoughts and prayers bullshit
@SenatorFischer Your "prayers" mean nothing. Do something.
@SenatorFischer Don't want your condolences.  We want gun loopholes closed, background checks,  straw purchasing stopped NOW. #GOPkills
@SenatorFischer Yeah right, heartbreaking.Go count your blood money
.@SenatorFischer Take some real action to protect Americans from #GunViolence! Your #NRA paid for thoughts and prayers do nothing. #GunSense
@SenatorFischer hope you enjoyed your NRA bribe!
@SenatorFischer you got $1,651 from the @nra  explain yourself.
@SenatorFischer SHAME. Putting $$$ over lives, now you offer prayers. Pontus pilot would be proud.
@SenatorFischer Thanks for the prayer tweet DEB. Why shucks, It's the kind of common sense reaction to a mass shooting that the NRA loves.
@SenatorFischer you received cash from @NRA. Gun violence occurs every day, not just mass shootings. Do something. #NotOneMore
@SenatorFischer fix it. fix it. fix it.
@SenatorFischer As a constituent, I expect to see you supporting efforts to restrict gun access to those who can pass a background check.
@SenatorFischer you can't cry about something you're doing nothing to fix.
@SenatorFischer quit praying and thinking and fucking DO SOMETHING.
@SenatorFischer Your thoughts and prayers are an excuse for inaction. Reject the NRA. Grow a spine. Fix this!
.@SenatorFischer Maybe do something like, I don't know, legislate? Enact laws and protections for prevention? Or pray and think. Whatevs
@SenatorFischer And my prayers are with you and the rest of Congress, that you might use your power responsibly for life, rather than money.
@SenatorFischer yeah because thoughts and prayers have always helped more than actions. Pathetic.
@SenatorFischer two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer #GunControlNow
@SenatorFischer Then take action and pass sensible reasonable gun control. Otherwise stop tweeting as though you're surprised and concerned.
@SenatorFischer I suppose there's an unending supply of thoughts and prayers just like the unending supply of bullets, but ZERO ACTION DEB!
@SenatorFischer my thoughts and prayers are with you. That you get a brain and do something to stop the violence.
@SenatorFischer Your prayers are awesome and all, but how about some fucking gun laws? Make a difference, why don't you?
@SenatorFischer Do something that'd actually make a difference if you're so heartbroken!
@SenatorFischer You are truly a pathetic disgrace to our country.
@SenatorFischer Work to fix this heartbreaking problem.
@SenatorFischer  "faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead." James 2:17 NIV #gunsense #sanbernardinoshooting
@SenatorFischer how about you actually do something quit talking!
@SenatorFischer Your "thoughts and prayers" are as valuable as a used McDonalds napkin. Typical Republican jerk.
@SenatorFischer Me thinking about your prayers: hmmm, pretty useless. 

Do something real and useful. #GunSense
@SenatorFischer I guess when you get election money from the NRA, all you have is empty words.
@SenatorFischer STFU. Actions, not prayers help reduce gun violence.
@SenatorFischer good thing is your gun stock will likely go up along with the NRA contributions to your campaign #GunControlNow
@SenatorFischer You know what these families, the hundreds of families across our country, need more than your prayers?  Policy change!
@SenatorFischer  Ah yes,  the bullet-stopping power of "thoughts and prayers".
@SenatorFischer coward
@SenatorFischer quit praying. DO something. Assault weapons are not necessary enough is enough.
@SenatorFischer you voted against background checks. Might need to unlock your hands in prayer to wash the blood off.
.@SenatorFischer you know what's better than your prayers? Action.  You're a senator. You have power.  Make America a safer country!
@SenatorFischer it's not mental health. It's guns. Other countries have mental health issues. No one has our gun problem.
.@SenatorFischer meanwhile your working to keep armor piercing bullets easy to buy by anyone, anywhere.
@SenatorFischer how's that NRA money you took for your campaign? So sorry you find gun shot deaths heartbreaking. So sincere. Not.
@SenatorFischer That all u got?
As pointed out by @igorvolsky, you took campaign money from NRA, @SenatorFischer. America needs more than your "thoughts and prayers."
@SenatorFischer BUT what RU going to DO? UR 1 of the people w/  "power"! There have been 300+ "difficult times" this year! #nraowned #blood$
@SenatorFischer NRA campaign contribution = blood money
@SenatorFischer pointless platitudes. your prayers are useless.
@SenatorFischer God helps those who help themselves.
@SenatorFischer How about you, you know, actually do something, other than accept more NRA $.
@SenatorFischer That means nothing. Your VOTE FOR GUN CONTROL would have meaning. #GunControl #Gunsense #NotOneMORE
@SenatorFischer how about you take those thoughts and put them into a comprehensive gun control bill.
@SenatorFischer My thoughts and prayers are that you'll find your  morals and sense of duty DO SOMETHING! #SandanBernardino
We need not only prayers,but more action !!!
@SenatorFischer
@SenatorFischer THEN DO SOMETHING
@SenatorFischer Prayers are not working. We have been praying since the little children were gunned down at Sandy Hook. We need action!
@SenatorFischer not good enough Deb.
@SenatorFischer Is doing nothing about it what you mean by "Nebraska common sense?"
@SenatorFischer another NRA shill offering soul crushing emptiness. Your "prayers" will do nothing for the dead. Sleep tight, senator.
@SenatorFischer Your thoughts and prayers aren't enough. Stand up to the NRA and do something to prevent the next one.
@SenatorFischer you just keep cashing those @NRA checks
@SenatorFischer hypocrite
@SenatorFischer your thoughts are only with @nra dollars. Despicable.
@SenatorFischer One would hope you've been thinking and praying all along. Time for action.
@SenatorFischer Since you take NRA donations, I guess all you will do is pray and think?
@SenatorFischer If you accept money from the @NRA you're part of the problem. Prayers can't wash the blood off your hands.
@RimaMonique @SenatorFischer @NRA Exactly, @SenatorFischer u lie w ur "thoughts".
@SenatorFischer if i gave you, say, $1652 - would you vote to protect Americans from rampant gun violence?
@SenatorFischer When you're done, howsabout turning down #NRA money & passing meaningful gun control legislation? Thanks.
@SenatorFischer You can #prayforsanbernadino all you want, I want my government to #legislatefortheliving.
@SenatorFischer Heartbroken enough to reject NRA campaign contributions?
@SenatorFischer your prayers don't do anything to save people. Stop being a slave to the NRA and work to fix it.
@SenatorFischer As a constituent, I demand you support increased background checks. Otherwise, your prayers don’t mean anything.
@SenatorFischer Considering how your prayers didn't help out the last 300+ times, keep that shit to yourself. DO SOMETHING !!
@SenatorFischer
