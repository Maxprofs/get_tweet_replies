@ClaraJeffery #YearOfTheWoman
This woman has never heard of Margaret Thatcher. Stop playing the victim card. No one is stopping them to become politicians.
Men and women are not the same. Gender equality is only a theory #womensmarch #genderequality #MAGA @SenGillibrand
why did they march again?  Oh yeah, a big hissy fit
women's March in NYC 400,000

Imarch for these 2 I raised to respect and honor women, our planet and all other people #whyIMarch #WomensMarchOnWashington
Please tell us what exactly they have been forbidden from doing?  They TRASHED DC with their mess.  Thanks a lot for that.
@ScottEvon  Can't wait!
@MrJamesonNeat
Thank you for your leadership! We all appreciate you!!! Keep voting against his nominees.
Women love me, everybody loves me, they must be mad about something Pence said. #fakenews

Or to put it another way:
...we all know you want to pick up where Hillary left off. Please just...don't.
as your heads explode with hate. Get your behind out of NY and talk to your countrymen.
Get petitions ready start getting signatures.
Run for office in your areas.
We need city councils, we need many.
Yay! Go!
@cdjinteriors Thank you for your leadership and refusal to accommodate. Ooxxxooo
Thank You for holding the line for Democrats, Progressives, Liberals
You should have seen our Multnomah County Dems meeting a few days ago. Record turnout. 35 new precinct captains
Love it! <3
First we marched, now we fight. #IStandWithPP for reproductive health and rights.
and you run for president.  Gillibrand 2020
Love the picture with an @EmergeAmerica poster from the Women's March! We trained 23 women @emergemaine this weekend to run!
We love Kirsten and think she should run for President!
: Thank you, Senator, for leading the way! If you run in 2020, I'd be more than happy to vote for you! =)
you are a beacon of hope. We support you!
Hey big Dem donors. Give dems money to move to Republican gerrymandered districts and take them over.(I know, crazy idea)
if you can figure out an agenda besides degrading women with focusing on vagina hats rather than a quality character
@Pie_SocialMedia
Thank you for standing strong with the American people re: cabinet; you are a Patriot
Can we hold you to that, Senator? See you in three years?
<3
Until then grateful to have you in office fighting for us! As a member of your Congressional district, we're proud of you!
@womensmarch  good.
yes! @EmergeMaryland @EmergeAmerica We can help!

Please? This election felt like the last breaths of old, bigoted, hate-filled white men. Bring on fresh blood.
@JonesOnTheNBA That's more like a anti-trump rally...Let's be honest
I hope this true.

God has a very special place for you in HELL!!!!!!!!!! KEEP YOUR LEGS CLOSED INSTEAD OF KILLING BABIES!!!
@womensmarch Women should be guaranteed health care. After all two lives are being saved have a child.
Get Ivanka Trump on your side and use next 2 years to find &prepare female candidate who can win
@womensmarch Good luck getting Elected!
 “Keys For President”
thank you for being the badass leader you are
Instead of shouting&protesting use the next 2 years to find the democratic woman who can win the  election.
And, you have that right thanks to the efforts of thousands of white men! You're welcome! @TrishIntel @KennedyNation 
@womensmarch Absolutely!
I wish you had the same enthusiasm for Right to Life! In your world, it's ok to kill a partially born baby? I don't get that?
Terrific sign!
please run for POTUS in 2020!
ok, I'm in. #GillibrandFranken2020
You know it!!
Gillibrand 2020
They fight so hard against women only reinforces they are insecure, we already got bigger balls called ovaries!
Gillibrand 2020!
Please relate to your colleagues (R and D) that the ppl are pissed with how things have developed this past week
As the only lawmaker who is fully in the #resistance, I'm waiting for you to run. Hold the line. Then draw a new one.
and the day after that things will truly be better
....Amen girl!
