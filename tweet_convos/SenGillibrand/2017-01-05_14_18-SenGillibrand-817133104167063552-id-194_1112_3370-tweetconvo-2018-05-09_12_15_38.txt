#IStandWithPP
Oh, so you APPROVE of the organ harvesting that PP has been doing, huh? Does that fall under the heading of  'women's health?
Reputable citation/source for this claim?

Who are you really? Interesting how so many hide behind cute avatars and nebulous "bios."
He stung you so you go ad hominem huh? You're a joke
@frankdugan @HouseGOP 
well then you need to be voted OUT
Thank you, Senator. Please run for POTUS in 2020! @HouseGOP
Thank you for representing us and standing up for what's right.
We are supposed to have a Representative government & important laws need direct public input, not decided by a few
I think when it comes to major changes like Repealing the ACA or defunding a huge program, it should be on ballot!
Thank you!
.@SenGillibrand Thank you. Keep it up. It's going to be an exhausting 4 years, but we're counting on you.
Thank you Senator for standing up for women's health & #reproductiverights @reprodocs @PPact @NARAL
Women can also go to local OBGN for same services. No need for Planned Parenthood
provides sexual & reproductive health care, edu, info & outreach to 5M women, men, and adolescents worldwide each yr
Our local doctor's, hospitals and state agencies do the same
Seems like u live in a fortunate area w/ access to health care. Congrats! Don't assume everyone has this luxury.
The vast majority of this great country has access to healthcare. @ppact exclusivly in metro areas with access
Thank you Senator Gillibrand! We support you!
It's really simple. We don't want taxpayer $$ going for your abortion ops. Other women's health activities are ok.
If you have #ACA why do you need Planned Parenthood? Oh, can't kill babies under ACA. #IStandWithPP
Thank you. Proud to have voted for you.
And I stand with you, @SenGillibrand. Proud to call you my Senator.  @girlsreallyrule @HouseGOP

thank you from a fellow New Yorker
we spend <half a $BIL on PP and >$2BIL a year on free phones. I think healthcare is more important than free cells.

#DefundPlannedParenthood #DefundPP
please keep standing against them. Let us know what we can do.
Anyone that can afford to donate millions to politicians doesn't need.Oh look, they are one of your biggest donors!
thank you. #istandwithplannedparenthood too.
You'd better be damned glad I and SOO many others can't vote against you, Madam... Happiest of New Years to You
im in with alot others.
#istandwithPP  Thanks for fighting the good fight.
keep fighting
thank you @SenGillibrand I stand with #PlannedParenthood too #WomensRights
Why force people to fund murder? Keep PP private, don't make the rest of the country support your mistakes.
Good for you! Let's kill as many babies as possible. It's progress. Fewer babies=fewer carbon emissions. A win-win!
shocked
how can they defund? Even PP says they receive no direct funding,  only Medicaid reimbursement for services.
Waiting for the first of your many filibusters and holds, Senator! Start tomorrow w/objection to EC count. Stand.
Thank You.
#FeelTheBern We Don't Stand Down  Ever  Go with that
Keep standing up against them. They sure did Obama.  I am tired of the hypocrites.
Why should the federal government fund planned parenthood?
Planned Parenthood is not a government agency. The country has plenty of OBGYN's
Thank you
Thank you! The @HouseGOP is going to screw over the people who put them into power, along with the rest of us.
thank you #IStandWithPP
Thank you, Sen Gillibrand!
thank you! New York had your back! Keep fighting!

OBGYN's don't provide all the services listed? Explain please
thank you senator!

Thank you!  Glad to call you my Senator!
you stand with people who think it's ok to sell human body parts of aborted babies. #disgusting
yeah, cause admitting it on video isn't enough to convince you.
Sneaky fascists aren't they? They underestimate the fight of the American people #Resistance
Thank you
@LiberalResist @HouseGOP thank you Sen. Gillibrand for supporting a woman's right to access healthcare.  We salute you.
As a constituent, thank you senator. As a voter, I will do everything in my power to unseat the GOP in 2018.
thank you for defending @PPact
Yes and she didnt! The Dems failed us all!
thank you Senator Gillibrand!  Fight for us!! For our lives!
@photome @HouseGOP Keep fighting the good fight. We appreciate your courage. We're all in this together!
getting rid of #PPH is as bad if not worse than defunding the #CDC will cost us Billions! #NoTrumpNWay
It's a new America Senator. If you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA
- Right. tRump is the problem and republicans have no solutions!
We're you born stupid or is from all the Koolaid?
As a small biz owner, I see GOP targeting a perfectly legal business with a spotless record, for personal reasons.
if men were dependent on @PPact for their ED meds then funding would never be an issue. #IStandWithPP
#IStandWithPP
tell the establishment dems to grow a spine and do not give in to the republicans!
Thank you Senator for not being afraid to stand up for what is right.
@Honey17011 @HouseGOP God bless you for fighting for us. GOP isn't pro-life when they take away our health care.
KEEP FIGHTING. CONTRACEPTION PREVENTS ABORTION.
thank you. Women rely on access to this care. Does the @HouseGop care about women? #notjustamansworld #IStandWithPP
Thank you Senator Gillibrand! #IStandWithPP
Thank you, Senator!
thank you!
thank you!  This is INSANE!!  #StandWithPlannedParenthood

@Honey17011 @HouseGOP Stay strong! We need you!  The GOP is trying to dismantle safeguards & common good. Fight.
If ACA goes I'll need planned Parenthood for my daughter it's the only clinic that will see her she's on ACA now
Thank you Senator. Please keep fighting for the vital services the PP provides!
Keep fighting Senator. The GOP don't want to #DrainTheSwamp, their continued reckless behavior is bad for America
My own story with @PPact
1. In the 1980s, as a teenager in rural Conservative Christian America, we lived well, but we lived in poverty & we had no medical ins.
@scoutinfinity @HouseGOP we women are watching, and we can get nasty when needed. Tell them hands off our....#IStandWithPP
Join House Dems challenging electoral vote tomorrow. They need one senator.
how did it go?
if you stand with America U will challenge #objectECvote and we could secure #PlannedParenthood Do the right thing.
Unconscionable. GOP women-you, your daughters will be hurt. Stop this insanity. #Istandwithplannedparenthood
@girlsreallyrule @HouseGOP Thank you!
our senator Gillibrand fighting for women's health and rights. Maybe Gillibrand in 2020. Hope!
give them hell
thank you...from proud NYer
#ACA please don't bring back insurance companies denying coverage because of pre existing illness
thank you for standing against @HouseGOP #ACA
Thanks! @SenGillibrand But @HouseGOP Americans will call Members of Congress: US Capitol Switchboard (202) 224-3121. Save #ACA #Obamacare
@nastynoreaster9 @HouseGOP thank you.  These men are crazy.   Remind the religious nuts most abortions are on Christian women
so I guess you haven't learned anything either? Not all your constituents are democrats. Thanks for not rep me.
thank you! @PPact is vital. Do you hear that @HouseGOP ?!
#SpinelessSpeaker
Thank you! @spmaloney will stand with you - thanks to you both
@realDonaldTrump :what do you think about this? We're all contacting out Reps & Sens-how about a tweet-yeah, right!
Thank you!
Thank you!! Very grateful you are my senator!! 
@Deemoney521 @HouseGOP   Thanks @SenGillibrand
I stand with PP! Protect vital health care for millions of women and men!
Idiots

I'm one of your constituents. Thank you for fighting for me, for us.
@AllLeftNews @HouseGOP 
Tomorrow, can you please stand up and reject the Electoral College vote? This election was total sham
You should be ashamed of yourself
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. #IStandWithPP
I'm a NY resident and I do not want to see tax dollars funding the murder of children.  Sorry.
Cancer rate has been reduced by 25% since 1991,no doubt planned parenthood,woman's proactive care was part of it.
even war monger Hillary Graham will vote for defunding this murdering machine! You lose....AGAIN!
Thank you!
@ppact sells baby parts. I don't want my tax dollars supporting such a ghastly organization.
Good for you. Now we know who to vote out next election. We'll just add you to the list.
Thank you @SenGillibrand KEEP STANDING!! We need you to stay strong against the @HouseGOP & remember the last 8 years. #TheResistance
Thanks you for standing up against @HouseGOP horror show! Please continue to #StandWithPP
your fighting a war you cant win. Funding is gone get over it
spoken like a true woman-hater. PP has provided needed health care to poor women of all ages - jerk!

Remember, everyone: Planned Parenthood provides more than abortions. They also have vending machines with Pepsi for only a dollar.

Thank you for trying. @SenGillibrand A pox on both your houses. @HouseGOP
Thank you. Let constituents know how to support you.
thank you for your strength you are our voice and the future of our country!
I am a New Yorker & I expect nothing less.
Most businesses Don't use Taxpayers  $$$$$!!!!#
Thank you, they seem hell bent on hurting womens health.
Maybe u should get off twitter and answer UT phone in DC.U don't return calls when number is left on voice mail :(
.@SenGillibrand @HouseGOP As one of your constituents, thank you! @SenateDems @PPact
