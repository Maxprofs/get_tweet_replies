Last time I checked healthcare is a service, not a right.
So is DUE PROCESS for the accused and you don't seem to care about that on college campuses, hypocrite
it is not a right to be guaranteed health care
Then don NOT make the cost so expensive with ur regulations --DEMS need to SHUT UP and let Docs do their job.
the issue isn't the Dems, it is building a system on the greed of insurance companies. The @GOP plan makes this worse.
insurance companies have like at most 3% profit a margin.  Apple profit margin 40%
so that's why we aren't supposed buy a $700 phone, instead spend $10k a year on care. Got it. Thanks.
to lower healthcare you need to address base costs. We could start with the ambulance chairing lawyers! Tort!
start with CEO and Executive pay. Or will that money trickle down?
how much do you pay a person to run a 6000 employee company?
depends on exact specifications of  job description generally the exec paid to take media guff in time of crisis.
If its available, everyone has access. Nobody is taking away anything.
Show me which of the ten Bill Of Rights that is in.
AS LONG AS THEY PAY FOR IT THEMSELVES. IT'S NOT GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO SUPPLY HEALTHCARE. #Fraud IN NY MEDICAID.
REALLY --WHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION DOES THAT COME FROM????-9TH & 10TH AMDTS SAY NO FEDERAL RIGHT to insure
Please fight against 45's WealthCare proposal. It would give to the rich and take from the afflicted.
Please explain to the Republicans what "wrong" means. It's a word they aren't familiar with.
because they are usually right?
Thank you for caring whether people live or die, which has seemingly become a shockingly rebellious position lately.
really? It's a right? Can you show where in the constitution it shows that it's a given right? Like the 2nd amendment
improving QOL is basic duty of gov, healthcare access is important for US as > 50 % population is above 40 yrs
Please fight against 45's WealthCare. It gives to the rich and takes from the afflicted.
@susanfaiola Obamas mother DIED fighting for insurance to pay, & denied. She was denied life and to see her son become POTUS
We The People cannot go backwards, the GOP needs to be impeached. GOP tried to repeal Obamacare 200 times !!
@billsfan111344 shut up
Must push back against Trumpcare by offering single payer as the negotiating alternative. Compromise to LEFT of Obamacare!
You guys must find away to block them!!! What ever it takes!!! And thank you
As is clean water for Flint.   Has the US abandoned them?
"I agree... so is access to a Bentley... still doesn't mean we are entitled to either--just the access to it."
Know what else is a human right? Not being child-molested by immigrants you, yes, YOU pushed through customs.
Not access to - that's the GOP's plan - but honest to God good coverage is the human right
yes it is, which is why we need #MedicareForAll or similar #SinglePayer system
Reply to @SenGillibrand  Oh, do gun rights count too???
let them pay for it ! NOT the young ppl trying to pay  OFF SO much STUDENTS LOANS
Thus the fundamental misunderstanding that Democrats have of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
no it isn't.
You MUST vote against Gorsuch even having a hearing! Only Merrick Garland or no one!
Keep fighting for us Kirsten!!!  We greatly appreciate your dedication and compassion!
I think you are confusing terms again. Everyone has and has always had access to health care. What is being taken away???
You couldn't be more wrong. Do the Vets get this "Human Right" that you speak about? U seem not to care about their "access"
I agree. Do your best to stop repeal.
If we could refrain from the word "ACCESS" that'd be good. Access is what #GOP is calling this. ACCESS is not what we want
what about your hand in my pocket, paying for it? Is that nice?
IMO, situation calls for more #righteousindignation Thanks. A constituent.
A good health care system is also vital infrastructure, as important as roads, bridges and damns. Classic #publicgood.
You took it from millions when you passed Obamacare, I'm one of them. And I'm one of your constituents.
So give us all Single Payer.. it's less expensive and better. Health Insurance CO's can provide in excess of Universal Medicare
Access are you now a Republican.  What about a right.  Go away
please please do everything you can to make sure my family does not lose coverage
"Wrong" is not  a strong enough word. Try OBSCENE. Try anti-American! Try heinous! People are going to die...
WHY this delusional - corrupt - Including Conflicts of Interest - White House Administration Still Walks the Halls of White HOuse
FIGHT HARD. FIGHT FOR AMERICANS.
Not "us". It's the Republicans @SpeakerRyan taking away health care.
Strike the “Access to” and your statement works. I have access to a Ferrari but that means nothing.
YES #ACAworks
Did you just make that up?
This plan of the GOP is absurd. If they go through w/it, they should be required to use same health care as the rest of us.
I agree, and apparently they will be coming after our drinking water next by gutting GLRI.  I feel under attack by trump/GOP
Meanwhile, forcing people to buy Health Care Insurance is even more wrong.  #EndItNow
Helloooooo.......  it's not a right!!
"Wrong" is not strong enough. It's immoral.
Thank you!
pls fight the Republicans on this. #HeroSen #healthcareisahumanright
thank u!
how can we stop this madness?  Give us suggestions
Time for single payer.
I agree. So why don't the Democrats back a single payer plan?
their corporate donors don't like that.
so what's your solution. Obamacare was not working for everyone, so what's the solution?
what can we do about all these other then complain? Take the lead please for all of us.
GOP will let us access health.  We just won't be able to afford it.  Like window shopping
no it isn't
Get a fucking UHC like a developed and civilized country, not the current and proposed bananarepublic drivel!
Taking away the ability to afford healthcare from the old, poor and disabled is nothing less than genocide.
everyone has access to health care. Health insurance and care are two different things.
Brain Injury Survivor here, Ryan's use of elective to justify the concept of compare prices ignores emergency,...
How can I compare costs while in a COMA.... Why do people not realize reality ??
you are wrong. Access is not a Human Right, Healthcare. Access means nothing if you don't have the means to access it.
#repealandreplacepaulryan
Yea&I seeYour lookingTheOtherway on theMany likeMyself it cutOff fromOurMedicals,Congress'Blew theWhistle onYouThis morning

ACA was aBustFrom theStart.&you&your fellow Democrats Knew,Oh by the way,theOneWhoBlewWhistle onU SenAshoo,Ca Dem
I would go even further, it'd be wrong of us to fail to provide health care to the remaining millions without it.
And we can do a whole lot more if we can get back in and make it a right and not a commodity.
we're not taking it away. We're making it affordable to those of us footing the bill
where do you come up with this crap, it is not a human right and we always take care of the sick, more liberal hyperbole
that's total BS!
A right to other people paying for your healthcare?? That's more like socialism.
What's sad and terrifying is that most Congressional Republicans don't agree with you. What can we do to stop this bill??
thank you
No it isn't.
Not wrong, Senator - immoral.
It'd be tyranny.
