writing to urge you to support progressive policies ! Thanks for your public service and for being transparent!
This woman murdered and tortured a man.  she spoke at your march.  you support this?   I am asking a honest question
I organized almost 300 women in my county who are now writing, calling, and sharing the issues daily!
can you please explain to me what the march was all about
to get your attention A couple of million people saying this is NOT okay Not targeted at GOP or DNC but a worldwide rejection
yeah @Madonna got my attention when she told people to fuck off. Is Negative attention good?
if that's all you got from it seems like you're not REALLY asking
let's go over it. Concerns equal pay- i for one didn't know women wasn't paid equally,pro choice concerned? Why? Gay marriage?
for me the march was about healthcare- making sure I kept mine despite my pre existing condion
has @POTUS said anything about taking away your health care? AHC cost my family around 13k a year. W/3500D. It's out of hand
there are faith leaders speaking out on these issues and working together to bring change to communities.  With you.
Thank you for opposing DeVos. Her agenda is not public education and she has no credentials to advance education in US.
FIGHT the DaPL and Keystone XL!!! We do not need to deepen the pockets of some at the health expense of many!
Attending our county democratic women's mtg tonight with my 76 yo mom <3 #resist
I stood outside your NYC office and spoke to your staff about your being undecided about unqualified Betsy DeVos!
Please please come meet with us in Brooklyn and tell us what to do!  We are ready to work hard in any way we can.
I vote against every crazy democrat & #boycotthollywood because I saw a lot of crazy women at the  #womensMarch
it was a sight to see Calm and resolute determined and diverse. No vitriol or aggressiveness You could have learned from it
Learned 2 wear a Big vagina on my head or how 2 use vulgar dirty language NO thanks
Lighthearted takes on protecting vaginas from grabbers and women's health deniers are only dirty to those who choose to see that
More disgusting & vulgar than anything #presidenttiTrump ever said
Wdn't hold my breath waiting for @SenGillibrand to endorse THIS women's march, @foodlover1958
Visited @SenTedCruz @tedcruz Houston office 1/24 to give my opinion about ACA repeal. Ended up getting escorted out by police
@daeneryasss
subscribed to NY Times and Washington Post.  Must keep this administration accountable.  It was a great march!
I want to be part of ur 2020 run for president!

signed up at http://SwingLeft.org  to turn more communities blue.
that's the problem.  you look at a community and see the color red or blue.  Americans see their neighbors. #ProudAmerican
the election is over but #betterlatethannever. Nothing like losing both houses and the presidency to wake up the complacent.

I will spend my days getting to know my community, volunteering for local candidates, and learning as much as I can to fight.
Calling your office at least once a week, though you're already doing everything that's important. Thank you.
Glad to see that one of the things you are doing, @SenGillibrand, is refusing to approve the nominations of terrible leaders. Thank you!
tell us what you want us to do! #1actaday
Trying to reach your office to ask you to please vote NO on DeVos (but I can't get through!!)
sending you, @schumer_chuck and @RepYvetteClarke postcards of #whyIMarch preaching to the choir, but the choir needs help!

I've an idea: run for president.
Speak to my Senators and Congresspeople about what is acceptable.
created a Facebook group for friends who are taking action, new twitter account and following indivisible ideas.  More 2 come
watching Fox News.
keeping an eye on proposed bills, marking critical vote dates. Need to make calls. Help anyone thinking of running campaign.
I'm writing to you for starters. We gave you a powerful mandate. We're behind you. Be intrepid, don't back down, we love you!
Wonder how many tons less does this world weigh? Oh well Tuesday rolled around now we are twice as heavy...
can someone please tell me what rights have been taken from women???
how about this @ecdems
MORE action??? Uhhhhh what action was already taken?? That was actually positive, helpful, productive, & classy???
yea, the beginning of the failure
battered mothers have been at the Whitehouse every mother day being ignore. I suspect this year will be no different.


how do democrats support inbred muslim immigration when they force women to be separate & unequal and child marriage? how???
here is the lead march organizer supporting Isis. Islam and womens rights cannot coexist
they well can return and clean the mess #WomensMarch
for one I'm going to keep calling you to make sure you represent me! (Thanks, btw) But also calling your colleagues daily
I called you and Senator Schumer and used your contact forms when couldn't get through. I feel great!  Thank you.
applying to join my community board in upper Manhattan!
I called you today to voice concerns about Betsy DeVos!
What are our doing to seperate yourself from the filthy mouth celebrities?
Those "celebrities". Or so called- were a disgrace and none of you have condemned them. But I am sure you would have for Hillary
Admiring your heroism. #resist
We are standing with Trump!
I will pick up a phone and #grabaclipboard. I will keep saying yes to volunteering for candidates and issues.
Keep watching the videos from the event for entertainment purposes while trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with the left.
My family committed to donating $10 a month to 10 organizations that support human rights
I'll be contributing $10/month to 10 organizations that can help those who stand to be most affected by Trump. Please do the same & retweet.
hi Senator! I'm from Syracuse NY and I don't know where to start! Suggestions?
asking you to not confirm Betsy DeVos!!!
I'm going to call at least 1 elected official every Friday to request support for specific issues. #PhoneCallFridays
Hopefully you continue to wear disgusting hats and yell more foul things because that doesn't make women look crazy. #setback
I'd call my congresspeople, but you're already fighting for all the right things. (I emailed instead.)
Doesn't need to be a top down movement. I was at DC #WomensMarch & on the bus home we were planning our own steps forward.
I am coming to your office tomorrow to IMPLORE you to vote against Betsy De Vos as Secretary of Education.
Calling my Senators, Congressman good & bad, acting locally, thinking globally. Keep doing your part, we'll do ours.Thank you
I marched but now I don't know what to do! Living in NYC, you and my other reps are on it. Suggestions?
run for president
I'm sorry, I. Reading all these responses, and it's like seeing a turtle on its back trying to turn back over, so adorable!
support the ACLU won't do much, but it sure gives the CEO a huge paycheck
more marches, more protest, more complaining. I think a couple more, and Trump will feel bad. A bad bad man! Haha
I'm running for office
Please don't support Betsy DeVos. Why are you still undecided? Leave her to the grizzly bear and don't let her near our kids.
Binghamton March was amazing. Holding Tenney's feet to the fire. Ramping up my own local activism. Women get shit done.
calling all MOC on each committee. this provides info & scripts: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8Gf0r50LqhCWl9xZUJZbE5vNE0/edit?filetype=msexcel#TheResistance â€¦ #standindivisible
I'm attending my representative's town hall for the first time.  Oh, and calling my senators every day ; )
Not sure, help!
Your address was great. Proud to be a New Yorker. Please continue to resist. You are going to hear from me every week.
#MAGA Progressives lost and continuing to whine won't change it.
I applied for jobs with NYC and state offices; I'd rather work for you.
Please vote no one DeVos in support of public education
NO to @BetsyDeVos and Sessions!
You must not support Betsy DeVos for secretary of education. She is wrong for public education!

Thanks for everything you are doing. I've emailed my senators (you!) & rep Faso anti Betsy DeVos. I pledge something daily.
Give to progressive causes, make phone calls, organize with my neighbors, support free press
I am calling my congressman to express my opposition to HR 7
Exposing to the world how hypocritical, divisive and ideologically totalitarian the organizers of these marches truly are.
I'm really asking - what are next steps?  What is first goal?  What can we do to contribute?    I'm lost as to what's next...
I just heard you haven't decided on DeVos yet- I'm surprised. please vote no!
#StandUpForLindaSarsour
I've been trying to reach your office to urge you to say no to DeVos. No luck so far, but counting on you.
Thank You for being a champion for all of us. You work does not go unnoticed or unappreciated.

How about just doing your job....folks like you are why nobody trusts politicians.
maybe next #WomensMarch should take on Islamic FGM, forced marriage, stoning? These are real issues, but you're too cowardly!
amen. They go after the silly issues to give the illusion that they're actually doing something that matters.
liberals are a bunch of useless white genocide promoters.
I'm making at least a call a day M-F to Congress Reps #smallacts follow my feed to keep me accountable!
