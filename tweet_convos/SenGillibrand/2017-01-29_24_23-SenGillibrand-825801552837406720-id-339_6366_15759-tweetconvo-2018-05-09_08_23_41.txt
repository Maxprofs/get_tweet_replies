Your a true Dem. #Strong Presidential material. #PresidentGillibrand.
Remember to pace yourselves to avoid burn out. They want us to give up. Join group like Indivisible. Strength in numbers.1/2
Pick one or two days tops as YOUR action days. Let others do same. Recruit others to join. Make it fun. In it for LONG HAUL.
We won't!
Trump's ignoring of federal courts is criminal, @TheDemocrats need to publicly, loudly demand impeachment.
it's too late!!! Game set match! This is their world, we're just living in it!
The fight is never done.
I like the optimism... but man... we're fucked!
thank you for the encouragement!

Working to remove Steve Bannon from National Security Council should be a huge priority too. He has no business being there.
Kirsten, please call a spade a spade. Trump's exec. orders are illegal & unconstitutional.
Thank you. I wish all our elected officials believe as you do.

Trump is only in it for the future investment opportunities
Not planning on it. Thank you for being the only congressperson with a spine.

You might mention to Senator Warren that includes not voting for ANY Trump nominees.

@jessesingal Especially once "your team" sits at the helm of state.
I agree! Let's shut NYC down with protests!
From this point forward, ANY Dem that colludes w/ Trump is guilty of TREASON. Pls. let your Senate Colleagues know this.
Thank you for your service and support!
Thank you for taking-on Trump so aggressively. Hoping that other Congressmen & Senators soon follow your lead.
