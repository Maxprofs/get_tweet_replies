Senator, we're waiting on your response to #Charlottesville. Please speak out.
Clovis the latest Evangelical to join this crew
There's a reason this admin is so anti-science. Media reluctant to cover /1 
WHEN YA GONNA GET OFF THIS BS TRAIN
Explain it to the WH?? Although everyone there understand it, Trump will not because he just CANNOT ever backtrack. His ego it too big.
It is time to start calling climate change denial what it is, the alt-right gateway password for racism and sexism. They bring up climate change denial to see if you’ve drunk the kool-aide too so they can dig deeper.
Almost every prediction has been WRONG, you still wants us to believe in this LIE! What have you been smoking?
Zzzz
Criticizing WH is not enough, we must present a positive, solutions-oriented vision of 100% clean energy by 2045 for jobs, health & security
Stand up to the racist bigots in the WH.  We need to hear you condemn the hatred that DJT has promoted in our country.#Charlottesville?
The time for explaining is over. We need action. And if WH won't do it then Congress should.
The people demand meaningful action. Not having agencies like EPA gutted from the inside by Pruitt.
Congress can do a lot to protect the climate. Defeat the dirty energy bill. Investigate FERC. Be our climate hero. #mothersprotectclimate
They know. They don't care bc they make money off of fossil fuel. This is not ignorance, this is greed.
Hi Kirsten. This is Twitter. We’re doing Nazi mobs today, and nuclear war. Best of luck with your climate change messaging.
Some of the scientist need that explained to them too. Seems this has happened before and we need a lot of research on it from all sources.
If that's true than the leaders of the movement should lead by example. Al Gore should publicly give up his climate damaging technologies!
The Trump White House is not listening. It's up to us to act in a responsible way.
Impeach trump
B4 touting the party line and lecturing us, read this!
Stop and get to work on helping  the the Harding working Americans by helping the pres with tax reform  special interest is old now
Climate change is natural caused by Sun and ocean cycles not man. To suggest otherwise shows your ignorance.
No it is all bullshit
Watch Al Gores film or De Caprio's. He's an ignorant 71 year old bigot. If his golf courses were in peril maybe then.
We are trying but need political support to fight back against the silencing of scientific research by the Administration

They seem to be unable to deal in facts
Start with encouraging your constituents to divest from oil and gas companies. Much more effective than talking to Trump!
Our more immediate threat is the white supremacists provoking violence in our streets. We need your help to stop it.

please show your support for your constituents by condemning the violent white supremacist rally in #Charlottesville
America needs to start listening now..as what they are doing is irreversible and if we loose anymore time our world will collapse fro sure.
You are my senator. Sadly, WH does not speak science. Skip explanations. Support #25thAmendmentNow 

#Science  #EducationIsImportant
Focus on the things we CAN change, while he is in office. @CoryBooker #MarijuanaJusticeAct @realDonaldTrump
Where have you been on #MarijuanaJusticeAct would like to hear/see more from you about it. You've been a pioneer in the past! @CoryBooker
He only eats meat fried chicken & cake no fruit or veggies duh 
??  The WH could care less, but the occupants know abt climate change.  Since beginning of time. You R the 1 that thinks it just happened.
Deaf ears, Kirsten. #25amendmentnow
The WH takes its marching orders from the Kremlin. If sugardaddy Putin says climate change is a danger, then Drumpf will listen.
The Threat of poverty for Upstate New Yorkers is a whole lot more real Senator how about trying to do something for your constituents
Grateful you are our Senator.
Grateful for all you do. But by not acknowledging Charlottesville & doing all u can to get this hateful regime out of the WH, u support it
Sorry, we forgot to get the memo to you.  It is now climate disruption. Our bad. Please don't use the term climate change any longer.
Climate Change is a myth with doctored data. Just a bunch of lobbyist trying to get rich of scare tactics..
Fox News interviewing real peer reviewed climate science professors would help.......if that does not work, try a carrier pigeon......
Scientists pay tied to grants and funding are driving climate change debate
Please explain the threat. Al Gore has been humiliated. Are you next?
They know it's real. They just don't care.
Maybe so but, really, such a tweet on such a racist day? Focus.
Yes however not let their indifference stay us from working in our towns, communities & states to effect pro-EPA actions. @Michael36776349
Nonsense. Extreme weather is normal. Read a history book.
Yes the climates been changing for thousands of years and your point would be???
It's weather it's not climate change Tina.
pollution is real, climate change is real, the proposals for dealing with it from iPhone wielding imbeciles are from #Uranus
The threat of hate is real!
The threat of white supremacy is real. As a constituent I am waiting for your condemnation of the hate in Charlottesville.
If you're in Florida, vote @GwenGraham for Governor 2018! She cares about climate change as our state will be under water if it gets worse.
She has as much chance as Debbie wasserman would have
Explain?? RESIST!!!
Extreme Weather? During Little Ice Age global temps were 2-3 deg. F cooler than today. That was 16-17th Century. You'd have been frantic...
No, it's up to us to remove this dictator from the White House. He will get us all killed.
the threat of white nationalists marching on Charlottesville is real too. We've seen these effects in WWII and my grandparents generation
I don't think WH cares
It is up to us and you and other politicians to help us get this NUTCASE out of The Peoples White House! Please understand!
Really ACA is discriminatory & racist to American Indians in non federally recognized tribes 500k ppl it's up to @CivilRights 1/3
To prosecute @TheDemocrats for a blatant violation of title 6 of the Civil Rights act. Pgs 2006-09 of ACA "forgot" non fed tribes but 2/3
Sebelius directive non fed tribes must prove "Indian enough" title 6 no fed $ to any program that uses race as a qualifier "Indian enough"/3
I'm hoping @POTUS will get tired of your nonsense & simply have @TheJusticeDept prosecute jail and fine you as require by Civil Rights act
THAR SHE BLOWS, AGAIN. MOBIE DICKLESS.
That's cool. Nazis are on the streets of America
Enough with the climate change bs .
Re:/ hint. When you got Climate change deniers that Scott Pruitt, Steve Bannon in the West Wing and Donald Trump pull out of
Paris Climate change accord or agreement and more.. it up to ( _________). Stop the Trump administration
You might as well talk to a wall. He won't understand.
THAT SHE BLOWS, again.
This implies that those in the White House care about climate change ... or anything other than money & power.
Senator, please speak out about the horrors in #Charlottesville.
they won't return my phone calls
What about the ice age ? was that extreme weather ? Where were humans then ?
Keep explaining it to the people. 

The WH knows what it is and they don't care.
You have to stop assuming the White House gives a shit. They're disorganized, misinformed, and stubborn. We just have to pick up the pieces.
Why even pretend explanations are useful? The fossil fuel industry owns this administration. Climate change denial, bought and paid for.
They and their Exxon masters don't care
@All100Senators http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/gw_hurricanes/fig33.jpg …
Can someone explain to the White House that punching a woman is not ok as well? Thanks!


Kirsten the White House knows. It's the rich lobbyist that Trump, McConnell, Ryan & many others pay homage to. If we know,  they know$$$$$$$
Senator, I respect you a lot, but your feed has seemed a bit tone deaf this week. Please speak out against Nazis and nuclear war.
Nazis are for the most point gone .. what are you talking about?
We did. They won't listen. Please tell me there is a plan b somewhere?
What affects have you seen, please enlighten us to these experiences that have not ever occured before in the History of this planet
Is it as much of a threat as NOKO with nuclear missiles? I will wait for your answer.....
Regardless, Congress should be taking independent action especially in face of hostile WH.
Even with denying Climate Change, pinning our energy infrastructure on finite resources is unsustainable.
