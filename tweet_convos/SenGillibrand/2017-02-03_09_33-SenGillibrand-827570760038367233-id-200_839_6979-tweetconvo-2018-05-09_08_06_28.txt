Sen. Gillibrand has voted against the most Trump's cabinet picks. That's called solving real issues
by all means, open the gates and let them rape our country with no opposition. /sarc
making mountains out of molehills only make things worse not better.
no, we are making mountains out of mountains. For your benefit too.
you keep telling yourself that.
I take a scientific approach: look for evidence and go from there. Try it
considering what your sources most likely are I'd say you're wrong.
oh dear Lord.
@CelticLion1977 @amyschumer please run in 2020. You're the only one with the bravery to stand behind ur convictions!! Thank U
with Barack Obama as VP.
vomit
@SenSchumer @amyschumer <- please continue to SIT OUT til 2020, no room for your childish BS in my govt
Your govt? I guess the two elected officials count less than some guy with a goldwater pic.
We pay them to opine & vote, not protest and sit out (prefer the ladder).
Sitting out was the right thing to do the other day they should not be voting without vetting
crybaby tactics. These swampers wouldn't vote for anyone #Trump puts up, regardless.
Some of these choices are atrocious and they shouldn't vote for them. Betsy DeVos primarily.
Thank you both for being awesome. Women are saving this country right now!
No they are not you fool. Ham-y Schumer is a fair-weather "activist" yo backed the wrong side
.@SenGillibrand .@amyschumer Calling your representatives works! #KeepFighting

FLASHBACK : "Feminist" Chuck Schumer Calls Flight Attendant a "BITCH"
@davidweismann David, why do you follow Senator Gillibrand?
You vote because of political reasons. When you do something that's not anti President Trump let us know.
You're a lightweight. No morals. You were pro gun anti abortion in congress. In senate anti gun pro abortion.
Very surprising but thanks
yes you do! #gotmyback
Thank you @SenGillibrand
I hope so cause I will be contacting you everyday thru all the means I have until I see some kind of action
