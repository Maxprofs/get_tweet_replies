Are they afraid of not having an abortion? What a horrible aspiration- sick. Buy birth control, not hair weaves!
Good for you, Senator!  I notice you are usually on the correct side of issues.
Thank you ladies. God Bless you all!

Wut?  You guys were just bored, admit it.  I've not yet found a reason for these "protests".
What women's rights do you think are in jeopardy?  I am thankful I did not vote for you.  Please stand behind our president. Embarrassing!
What on earth do you think is going to happen to them because POTUS is now in office?What civil rights do you feel are in jeopardy?Shameful!
@armandodkos Thank you. You were one of the first people I ever phone-banked for.
were where you when Obama declared war on rural America, or when he declared war on farmers and ranchers, or small buisness
So grateful to march alongside my senator today! Thank you!
tremp a rasism president to day he is in the white house
Too busy supporting murder that you had to vote no against General Matisse. I'd say wrong, but your"choice" is evil.

Looking forward to "The Promise Keepers" march on D.C. but of course you will be threatened n protest their right to do so
Proud to have you represent me!

Say a prayer for the unborn while you're there, please.

Thank you, Senator, for representing my wife, my daughters, and me.
Who's paying for this ridiculous field trip to protest our President and call for rights that already exist?
Will be at sister march in Albany NY. Thank you Senator!
Why no pink knit cap?  You just want to go through with the photo-op, so you can say you were there.  You didn't march either
Why are using a tampon today?
Are you protesting Saudi Arabia?
No stupid America Saudi soon
A another soft penis
I can't march today, but I am glad you're out there representing our state. Let us know and we'll march for you in 2020! 
Thanks for supporting us.
your a piece of work. I guess that's more important than reading you work and and voting correctly
Your a guy that can't do it without viagra but when your significant other see your post you will not it
you going to attack some cops for doing their job!
Only if they are good looking not that you are
thanks! I,m not superficial like you. You sound like @SenGillibrand kind of person though.

Dead penis walking

Thank you Senator Gillibrand!!! This NYer is grateful for your support and participation

Senator in title only your actions donâ€™t speak for all of
us.
In title only? Wtf does that even mean?
your constituents are marching with you in London!
thank you!
You are the present and the future! 
Thank you senator!
Thank you for marching with, fighting for, and representing women in New York State! @SenGillibrand
what rights no one will tell me I'm a woman and I still have my same rights
how about equal pay and the right to choose for a start?  More importantly, it's a march for equality for everyone
I've always made more money than my male counterparts still do Hillary paid women less than men what now
that's great for you, but you are in the minority.  Not all women are that lucky.
and also not all women apply themselves to get ahead I know a lot who are happy where they are getting by
may be true of some, but not all.  And as I said, this is about rights for all, including the LGBT community
and sessions fought for civil rights he prosecuted the head of the KKK and got the death penalty for a kkk..
Hallo he has a black past
Why did you vote No on General Mattis as Secretary of Defense?  Please advise.  Thanks.
