We need to help Florida and Texas first they are states!!!!
Puerto Rico is a part of the United States.
They are NOT a state!!!!
They are a territory you willful ignoramus.
They didn't want to be a state therefore no help!!!!! Next time they will learn they can drink their rum while rebuilding!
shut up you ignorant asshat, it has never been and will never be that simple.
Honey less tweets more working out those flabby arms!!
Hi! I need help contacting my Mom. She is in a nursing home in PR. And I been trying to call with no answer. Is been a week today.
Lourdes--This must be very distressing for you. Please call the Senator's office ASAP since they may not see your tweet. Good luck!
Thank you! I will in the am. They may be close now.
You can also propose & support an aid package for Americans in PR!!! @SenSchumer @MarkWarner @timkaine
@EllenPompeo @HuffPostPol thank you
I think Tr*mp has forgotten that they're Americans too... 
Thank you senator
Without energy, water. Gas are hard to find, food is begin to rot. Hurricane rain & wind was damaging, the river goes wild & my house flood
We're 5 people in a 3 bedroom house,2 cats (can't be outside the bedroom) 1 dog. Wait, 10.5 hrs for $20 bin of gas
I would like Congress to accept Puerto Rico as a State.
Also do not forget about US Virgin Islands.
What abt sending several Naval ships loaded with food, water & medical supplies to PR?!
Senator, please speak more on the humanitarian crisis in PR. I know Gov Cuomo & Rubio flew there. You should too w/Schumer and B. Nelson
Is there a bill for aide coming? NY voter asking #PuertoRicoRelief
Where is our government's response????
This is so sad
You're a racist

Thank you for requesting Congress to Help Puerto Rico in Maria Crisis...
At least someone worries about us, thank you for all your help
Since the president isn't doing his part.
Om mani padme hum for the victims of #HurricaneMaria
Own...Ah! if I could help ..
Thank you so much for retweet this! Gracias!@EllenPompeo
I'd like to see the government also do it's part. Wth is Trump waiting for? This is infuriating.
You're on the armed services committee.. can you get the military enaged? #PuertoRico
Thanks for this!
Here's what Trump thinks of PR. This is why he is not helping
Keep in mind these Trump tweets vowing to inflict a health care crisis on Puerto Ricans came before hurricane Maria decimated the island 
If only our government would lead the efforts. Can't Congress act?
How about the US government and military doing something as well? Trump is useless
https://catholiccharitiesusa.org/ .  Goes to Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands
What is Congress doing to help our fellow Americans? What's the delay? Military and aid should be a priority. We vited you in now act!
Finally someone in government speaking about this crisis of US citizens. Thank you. Proud you are my senator.
We've done what we can w contributions now pls call on DOD to send Navy & USNS Comfort. Also time to repeal Jones Act!
What is the Senate doing to help?
POTUS does not know Puerto Ricans are American and does not care because they are Hispanic and brown.
This is not enough. I want to DO SOMETHING. Something where I know 100% of the effort goes to relief. Not nebulous "proceeds"
Maybe we can re-direct President Trumps attention to something positive foe a change ! Just hoping !
Let the world know that ham radio operators are needed there
Please convince the Pres. to do something ASAP. Can he lead, or just Tweet and play golf?
When will they get an aid package?  They needed it 3 days ago. USS Comfort?  Send it.
Just called both my senators and my rep to urge action for these citizens. Let congress know it MATTERS to you!
-thank u but help is not there! Pls help Gen Matthis contact PR Gov. We'll also need help from CDC; illnesses & mosquitoes!
@IvankaTrump everyone is on board, please let us know how you plan to participate.
@Alancumming @HuffPostPol Tienen mi colaboracion
Unbelievable that our (wonderful) Senator needs to tell us how to help PR via private means, not through our own government.
Great. But please call on fed govt to get stepped up humanitarian assistance there immediately.  No time to waste on fund raising.
Someone should inform potus who is too busy worrying about controlling black athletes than helping pr
Thanks Senator! Stateside PRIcans are raising money! http://www.prxpr.org  #PRxPR #PuertoRico
Why don't the Senate pass a 1 trillion dollar pork spending bill to puerto rico n let us all get a cut of the money u no whst I mean
Thank you for calling attention! What are senate's plans to help? Pls repeal/suspend the Jones Act and call on DOD to send the USNS Comfort!
Thank you for sharing.  We need help!
Pls move Congress to action: waiving #JonesAct rqrmnts & getting Fedl Reserve to designate PuertoRico as distressed area 4 CRA investments
Let our taxes do their part.. disliking this begger, welfare country mentality. We have 700 B. for war, we have resources to help these ppl.
it time for the Hispanic community to stop support politicans & celebrities who dont support the rebuilding of Puerto Rico "wake up people"
Someone needs to stand up and shout about PR and Caribbean islands in Congress. Is our whole nation utterly lacking in compassion?
Done!
Done. Now what legislation have you introduced to provide emergency relief?
We know OUR part. Are you going to do your part, senator?
Why not use the phrase, "our part?"
Lead by example, Senator.
How much have YOU PERSONALLY donated to  already—BEFORE today? 
#PuertoRico
Thank you for remembering those in Puerto Rico. And let’s also not forget those in the US Virgin Islands. They’re all Americans!!
Move aid through the chamber. @SenateGOP drop #GrahamCassidy do something that matters.
Have any Trumps, pences, Mitches or Pauls seen this?
when is Congress going to vote on Irma/Maria federal aid, Senator?
If for every tweet there was a donation or a call to your senator or representative I would feel better about this, they need to move asap!
Thanks Senator. Too bad Trumps busy vilifying his "enemies" during this time of crisis.
One place to start is .@AeropuertoSJU where 1000 people are waiting for evacuation with no electricity or water. See .@DavidBegnaud tweets!
I wish those in the WH could remember that Puerto Ricans are American CITIZENS.
Nope here is Trump's tweets frm April
Keep in mind these Trump tweets vowing to inflict a health care crisis on Puerto Ricans came before hurricane Maria decimated the island 
Can you get Trump to do something too? I know he’s busy tweeting.
Please tell @realDonaldTrump to do his job as president and take care of these citizens. Please Senator, fight to help our country
Need a lot more help from the Pentagon.

1st step is educating @GOP & @POTUS that #PuertoRico is part of America.
Yes, of course. But what is the USG doing about our fellow American citizens?
How about getting the Senate to do something?
Is Melania having a tough time picking out the right heels to wear? Why are they watching football and not on the ground in PR helping?
It's all about the win
Heroes in pajamas!

Someone tell the @potus!  His Katrina.
We also need law modeled on the FMLA called Emergency Response & Recovery Leave Act - I would volunteer but can't afford to lose my job.
when will trump do his job? Where is the #USHS COMFORT?
I wish @realDonaldTrump would do his part as well
