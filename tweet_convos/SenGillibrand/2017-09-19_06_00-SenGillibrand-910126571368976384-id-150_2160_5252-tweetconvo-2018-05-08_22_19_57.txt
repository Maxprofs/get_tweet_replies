You don't need to stop it bcuz the ACA will shut itself down on its own.
#AreDoctorsForcedToLaborForTheFreeHealthcare ?
#WillYouEverStopGivingAwayStuffThatsNotYours ?
#ByTheWay #ItsUnaffordable
Keep fighting!
Thank you for protecting the ACA.
Stop them. The newest idea does not have my support.
Yes,it is.
80 billion for the military, but Congress can't approve a bill that gives quality healthcare to all, this is absurd.
One day doctors will only except cashc congrats you kill more then TB
It's really on the Senate. Voters will make any senator voting against ACA pay.
Voter suppression wont spare them.
It ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT! TRUTH! 
#FakeNews
You are fake news
NYs finest
You should be so proud of yourself leaving millions of Americans with fake healthcare overpriced
ABSOLUTELY!
Get the people of America to help you! Get them phoning and sending postcards
Go Kirsten!!!
Yeah!
Please stop the repeal!!
god we are weary-we are not going to make it to 2018
Why stop it, negotiate it. Do your job and stop blocking it
How about stopping the generous health care you elite politicians get first.
Praying they can be stopped again
please work to save ACA, work on universal coverage thru ACA, not repealing it for Bernie. We need coverage now not later

Thank you! New York needs you
Thank you! So proud you're my senator and I get to vote for you 
obamacare is a bad stain upon society.  It is unsustainable.  give it up.
Why stop? Let it expode and then it is on you
Please do! I can't throw any more $ to help, you & fellow senator's need to do this!
Thanks for voting against the $700B defense bill. That's why we're broke, not healthcare.
As Senator, I'm asking your advice. What is the best thing we can do as constituents, as citizens? Phone calls, letters, emails...?
Would make healthcare worse for Americans in just about every way. Thanks for standing strong against this bad bill.
Promise! Have you counted votes as Pence will do what his Massa says
Good luck hope with all my being that your lose. Your plan blows.
Thank you Senator. Please do all you can!
Let's hope so.
The American public is learning to hate these dam Republiclones with a PASSION.
So proud to shit on the will of the people, aren't you.
PLEASE,I implore you to stop this madness!
Repeal obama care NOW! Get the government out of healthcare NOW! Stop your leftist liberal lies and do what is right!
Are they committed to keeping the health insurance risk arbitrage business model, or are they open to a new approach? @nytopinion
You did not stop a damn thing, the Republican stopped it.
thank you. I am so proud you are my Senator and you keep fighting!
I respect you SO MUCH. So what are you and fellow Dems doing about this? We are making calls, faxing, texting. What else can we do?

*deep breath*
RED ALERT
THREAD: GOP HEALTH CARE REPEAL IS BACK 
Danger real • Activism needed
…
Just called your office! Keep up the fight #KillTheBill
#DumpGillibrand and support the whole darn #Trump agenda New York.
Please fight hard!
Not this time Kirsten. What Bill are you proposing? Medicare for all is a non-starter and you know it.
It seems that's their only interest.
I'm trying, but I'm tired.
Republicans are not the only senators promising to Repeal & Replace Obamacare. We must protect ACA from all who threaten it
Tgen offer support for Collins Murkowski and McCain standing by their principles
THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK NEED TO STOP GILLIBRAND VOTE GILLIBRAND OUT MAKE NEW YORK GREAT AGAIN
Call for town hall meeting making Cassidy and Graham answering questions. Defending this to Americans. Please push for this or you do it.
@GOP Needs to listen to this again since it didn't penetrate the first time.
This devastating “health care” bill is the result of what happens when a party becomes beholden to a small group of creepy billionaires. 
They're going to keep attempting on Oct. 1st too, but they won't be able to do it w reconciliation. At that point, they may gut filibuster.
We must call.
I applaud your efforts. Get @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain & @SenatorCollins onboard as NO...and maybe try @SenDeanHeller #GrahamCassidySucks
Thank you.
For those of us w/ Dem sens-what can we do to send the message to your Rep colleagues to #KillTheBill? Theyre not interested in our calls.
Thank you Senator.
Keep persisting! Thank you, Senator!
No John McCain stopped it!
Just pay for the damn thing stop trying to distract us from every other terrible thing you party is doing.
Explain #Healthcare is CEO PAY #kochi #taxcuts ~ always was/is #gop #RepealAndReplace #Trumpcare   NOT #Obamacare
Getting ready to fire up some more dirty language? Your crowd loves it.  Maybe give up your playpen in the Senate and work for Bill Maher
Do it! 
Fight to the end!!  I need some sleep. I worry most nights as I have a pre existing condition.
It's also on us to vote these assholes out so we don't have to go through this every six weeks!
Thank you, from a constituent.
Your office isn't picking up. Called 202-224-3121 six times to vote NO on #GrahamCassidy and the your line disconnects immediately.
Keep Fighting for us!!! 
ACA is a wreck, but you're doing nothing to fix it.  This is your opportunity, but you prefer oppositional politics instead.
trying to get rid of pre-existing conditions AGAIN-not too good for the women of America were born as a pre-existing condition #SaveACA
Keep fighting, Senator!
Thank you. And thank you for voting against the 700 billion dollar defense budget. It's unfortunate you were only 1 of 8 senators to do so.
I'm thankful you and @SenSchumer are my representatives
Thanks for always fighting back
You would rather put citizens at risk just to keep an obama legacy #sodas
Easy to believe: GOP doesn't care about their constituents. 
Difficult to believe: GOP attaching their names to a bill called Trumpcare.
Working on it daily 
No it's up to you to help America get healthcare. If Obamacare implodes and you don't support this you are leaving people without healthcare
Keep jamming  lines but also send free faxes to your members of congress via #Resistbot. Text Resist to 50409. Faxes delivered instantly.
Please STOP supporting Bernie Sanders in his deathly distraction & self-aggrandizement. Fight to #SAVEMEDICAID #FIXACA #SAVEACA #KILLTHEBILL
Enslave us no more with government programs.
So Dems get majority after Sept? How does that work? Repubs will keep tying til they lose majority.
The only way they get around the filibuster is attaching it to the budget reconciliation if they vote before Sept 30th
Can anyone provide HOW much tax payers money has been used to sue and repeal the health care bill since its inception? Wasted $
Thank-you for your service.
Please and thank you!
Thank you, Senator! I'm really glad you voted against the defense bill, too. Proud to be represented by you!
#pray they do!
Concentrate on fixing it. If it were your healthcare there wouldn't be an issue. It would be fixed within a week.
Have your heard anything about what Senators Collins and Murkowski are doing?
I  think they're no votes.
Republicans are repugnant.
Red states will receive $$ By taking billions away from Blue states. This is a shell game, @SenateMajLdr you're not fooling anyone
All senate women should vote no, based alone on higher premiums for women to cover pregnancy!
This assumes the GOP senators actually listen to their constituents. In the case of healthcare, they don't. It's the lobbyists they hear.
Thank you. Please talk to those on the other side of the aisle.
Let them do it. They will then own the market collapse and the argument for single payer will too loud to stop at that point.
Keeping fighting for Americans, Senator! We stand with u!
Call your reps! Had them accountable! Healthcare isn't a political game to play.
But that is what government is making it. Get OUT of my healthcare. Government never improves anything.
All decent Americans are against the deathcare bill. Please keep fighting.
Who's your health insurance provider ?
Nope, REPUBLICANS stopped it, Commie!
Thank you! Please do all that you can! People's lives depend on it!
Why don't they listen to their constituents? #TheyHaveInsurance #TheyAreNotListening #KeepCalling #FixACA
Why do you keep trying to force ACA down our throats while YOU remain exempt?
Marco Rubio's phone is off the hook and/or message box full! They don't want to hear from us! Maddening!
There's a way to clog his fax too. I'm trying to dig up the #
Please let me know!!! I'll send multiples!
Also twitter is an awesome way to reach them. Social accounts are closely monitored.
Doesn't this hinge on the same three republicans? What's changed for them?
We won't let them. #HealthCareForAll
You are all worked up about premiums & cost rising with Obamacare but fighting the desire to change the Dems crappy law.  Which is it
Thank you for persisting.
Thank you Senator Gillibrand for fighting for us
Who have you called today? Some senators have said they've gotten no calls! Things will get worse if #GrahamCassidyِ passes! Call now!!
Thank you so much and the people stand with you 
I've been contacting my two GOP senators daily, but know they aren't listening to me.
2018. Stay strong and vigilant!
Think VP in 2020
Stop
yep you are a great SENTORIA  ( ITALIAN  SENATOR  PRONOUNCIATIONS )  ACA   IS   A  NO GOOD  AS OBAMA  WAS WHY ENACT IT INTHE  BEGINING
Seems like such a waste of Congress' time by GOP
Please slow things down- #CassidyGrahamBillKILLS
You are supporting the infringement of our Natural Rights to choose what we do or do not wish to obtain. America is not socialist. #Corrupt
Thank you
Keep Fighting
America stands with you
#Resist 
#SaveACA
Actually they don't. NY and Ca do but that's about it.
What can New Yorkers do, Senator? (Besides give$ which I don't have)
