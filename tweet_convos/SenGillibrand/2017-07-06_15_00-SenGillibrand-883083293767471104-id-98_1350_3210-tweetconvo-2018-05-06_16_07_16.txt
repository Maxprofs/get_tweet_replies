And that's why @physicianwomen will keep speaking out. #DoctorsSpeakOut #NoTrumpCare #SaveMedicaidSaveLives
We have to keep fighting.  TY for your leadership and support for America and Americans.
It's time for universal single payer, Senator .
It will never be over Washington is broke from within Until Citizens United is reversed the ultra rich will continue to erode our freedoms
Citizens United is only the tip of the iceberg.
@PamKeithFL #SinglePayerMedicareForAll
Why fight? Be bipartisan and get Healthcare done. Do your job.
Please keep fighting, unmask @GOP for stealing healthcare from the ill/poor/elderly to pay the rich instead of keeping us safe from Putin
Iwant trumpcare to pass so i enjoy destruction of GOP's neanderthals, Biggest benefactors of ACA & medicaid.
True. But they probably won't have the votes. Unless, of course, someone spikes all the Dems water with LSD
Keep fighting.
This is exhausting. My life cannot continue to revolve around GOP insanity.
REPEAL & REPLACE. That's why my family and I voted for Republicans.
What provisions make it good for America?   There is still a huge mandate within the bill, so no one gets off Scott free.
Need to push for majority in the article one branch 2018 2018 2018 2018..and keep resisting until then!!!
Stop panicking. They won't even have the votes by August. Being an alarmist serves no one. WE ARE ALL ON TOP OF THIS.
Or that they wont take the excuse "we didn't have the consensus to replace, we will get that later, let's just repeal now. That. Is. Coming.

Work together
Fight the good fight.
But they have budget and tax reform to work on. Of course, with budget that's pretty much set, regardless of what congress wants.
How so?
You're an obstructionist. Pure and simple sweety.

Stop the GOP (Greedy Old Pricks)!
That's scary.
Think we got the votes to get rid of you
I remain optimistic team of sheroes will fix #ACA @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenKamalaHarris @PattyMurray @senatorshoshana #SheRose

So, Dems, start dealing with #VoterSuppression, #ElectionHacking, #Gerrymandering & State legislature elections. WAKE UP, NO MORE NICEY NICE
Don't worry we're coming for you #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Keep up the resistance
Eternal vigilance is not only the cost of freedom but also may affect the cost of your insurance.
Thank you for fighting.
Well you know that Mitch puffy face is pushing all of the GOP to vote for their made in secret plan with NO concern for the people!!
They need to vote on REAL HEALTHCARE not the terrible version they're trying to float.
I think the people have spoken if you don't like it you could always move to another country
True because some billionaire will give somebody big bucks to change a vote
GOP discussing sleeves
&JustCuz McConnell&GOPLdrship Drops #GOPTrumpcare DoesNot MeanThey GiveUpOn ACHA TAX Cut For The Wealthy! CALL GOP SENATORS REPS! #ShowUp
Work with the Democratic Senator from West Virginia.
Keep fighting!
Boy I sure hope so!
Don't give up! We're counting on you to keep your colleagues' collective feet to the fire!
Republicans have no intention of passing the bill. It is all about generating outrage and a fake fight.
They want to distract us all from the real prize in their sights: a 2018 election hack that will put GOP majorities in both chambers.
*super majorities. Uncrushable Republican super majorities so they can hand over the keys of gov't to industry and collect fat paychecks.
Thanks for fighting for us!!!
You realize that republicans are using healthcare as a cudgel to distract us from Russian hacking? They are prepping for hackthevote2018
Well, that's terrifying.
Thank you.
Don't forget, they lie too, about every damn thing. Don't trust a word they say.
What do the top ten cities with the highest poverty rate all have in common? Don' t trust demos with health care!!

DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP!
There won't be healthcare when our democracy collapses!? He must go now!!
Did you see they asked Hillary for her plan? Shameless.
It is inconceivable to me that Collins, Portman, Heller, and Murkowski will support a GOP health care bill.
I hate to disagree with a US Senator, but I think some of your Republican colleagues know they have to vote no on this bill.
Here is my take! ACA is not affordable and if it's left as is it will fail! ALL OF CONGRESS needs to sit down and fix it! Enough if your
Childish behavior-both parties! You work for us, not the other way around! If we behaved like this at work we would be fired
You don't have the votes b/c it has very little public support. Trying to keep it hidden = bad sign.Your cohorts are afraid for their seats
Thank you for your hard work to protect all New Yorkers!
R u out in your communities spreading the truth & getting more citizens on our side @ healthcare?
I sent my Congressmen my personal story of how bad pre-ACA healthcare has negative effects on my life 20 years later. I hope they read it
What about the people that ACA has hurt? Millions took the fine and it's unaffordable in NY
@SenGillibrand - Just relax and don't throw the F- Bomb around. Stay cool,you're doing good lately.
Resist, persist, & insist!!!!
We will just sit back and watch while the fraudulent unaffordable care act passed under your watch continues to implode.
why did the Democrats back HRC & not invest in your future ? You'd be a great Prez
Any comment on your friend, "Womens march" organizer Linda Sarsour calling for jihad against @POTUS ?
Just sick of it. They need to make ACA better and stop wasting our $$
SENATOR AND NEXT WEEK WE WILL KEEP MAKING OUR ARGUMENTS !IM SURE IT HAS NOT FALLEN ON DEATH EARS!
America, keep the pressure on. Call. Email. Yell at the whitehouse   Make your congressman and senator feel the heat from All Americans.
and will you participate in the process ? or just obstuct?
Repeal and give to the states as the Constitution states.
Agree. They're feigning defeat to try & get the public pressure off before they pounce. We won't fall for that trick again.
Senator don't let them get away with it. The welfare of the middle class depending on it
We do still need to fix the ACA. GOP shenanigans aside, it does have serious issues. Write the bill.
Will you offer amendments and withold consent to force public hearings?
It's the ploy before their next attack
Thanks  to @RandPaul .. please give credit where it's due .. True champion of our Constitution..
thank you for fighting for us keep up the fight!!!
Thank you for staying on top of this, Senator. It would really suck if things were to go the way of the House vote on the health care billâ€¦
And they are sneaky...
Call Toomey. Won't change his vote but at least we make his staff lie to us every day.
Keep up the fight!
