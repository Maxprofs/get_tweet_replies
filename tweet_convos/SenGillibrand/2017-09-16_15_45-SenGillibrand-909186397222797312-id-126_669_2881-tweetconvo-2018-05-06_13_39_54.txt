Senator, when will we be getting the CBO numbers on this plan? We got them pretty quickly when the GOP issued their plans.
Yak yak yak. But you do nothing or suggest alternatives. You aren't our senator you're about to find out. #dumpgillibrand
Please don't follow what @SenSanders  wants !  He wants this but has no way to pay for it !!!!
So I'd appreciate you not trying to split our vote on this issue. We here in upstate New York love Medicare for all.
You didn't talk to me. You Democrats made it partisan.
Thank you so much! @SenGillibrand we Here in Capital district Love you!!! Thank you for signing HR676 SALUTE!!!
Thank you! @SenGillibrand We Upstate New Yorkers appreciate you and Respect you for taking a Stance on this issue. #MedicareforAll
Health Care is NOT a Federal issue either. Read the Constitution Kiki, especially the 10th Amendment #LeaveHCtotheStates
@TenthAmendment
Why don't more people get this?!!  The Constitution is supposed to restrict the federal government, power is supposed to be with the states!
They don't get it because of 2 things. Reading comprehension barely exists in America. 2 People are F'ing LAZY lemmings.
The Constitution is a LOT more than the first two Amendments to the Bill of Rights.

Article I Section 8 is pretty damn important...
Yes, blame the Jews for everything, Adolph. And $3 billion pays for about four hours of Medicare for All.

First, we STOP #GrahamCassidy #ProtectACA DC Switchboard 202-224-3121: @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenCapito
Well it's all those partisan things you did before this great illumination that are the problem. Partisan #ObamaCare needs to be removed.
I live in NY and you didn't talk to me. I don't want unelected bureaucrats making my medical decisions. I want your plan.
How about this you like paying out the nose in premiums then move to Florida! We here in New York prefer Medicare for all. #HR676
Bot
But you made it that way. Govt run with corruption is the ACA. GOP is clueless. There are solutions, govt is NOT the answer.
And should not be an enhanced ACA with heavy dependency on high cost insurance companies. Yes We heard your CODE WORDS
So how about you tell @SenSchumer that since he's the one that said single payer is on the table on @GStephanopoulos Sunday show months ago.
Hey, @NomikiKonst  Are you as happy as I am that @SenGillibrand signed Medicare for all legislation.  I know I am!!!
You're awesome! @SenGillibrand
Government needs to get out of the healthcare business. Free market and no regulation. Competition will make it affordable
U need a better solution then.
Then stop being so partisan. And clue how much "Medicare for All" will cost, or do you even care?
Glad I voted for you!
No ACA repeal

DUMP Corrupt Profeteering Trump Pence Ryan McConnell Kushner Dvos Session all GOP Dem Reps sabotaging & voting for ACA REPEAL
Yes. For ALL. Free health care for illegals!
http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/u-s-shouldnt-copy-u-k-s-collapsing-single-payer-health-care-system/ … this is what you want for America? Ration healthcare? Who's going to pay? Raise all taxes?
It won't work USA can't afford it! Australia doesn't cover illegals 1year or more to see a doctor in Canada! Stop lying
They want what's best for their stock portfolios
I couldn't have said it any better!!!. Even though I live in SC I feel like you represent me and my family.
What happened with @POTUS44 cramming #Obamacare care through without working with single @GOP, hypocrite? Do politicians ever tell the truth
Nor should it be a Right!
I concur, I also believe researching a idea thoroughly before supporting it shows wisdom. 1pay is not a good idea.
So why did you vote for Obmacare?
Then take your socialist program and have the state of New York pay for it
'Medicare for All' wasn't well planned or timed. The GOP has been busy gutting the ACA. Contact Congress folks. Lives depend on it. #SaveACA

The Graham-Cassidy disaster has to be the focus right now. #MedicareforAll needs to wait a few weeks. #SaveACA
@physicianwomen 8000 women docs from around the country want to meet with you and help form policy
I vote in NY.  Go ahead and proclaim everyday should be sunny.  Did the democrats make Obamacare partisan - not a single republican vote.
But you keep it that way!
The truth about Universal Health Care and why they dont want it. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10214027500826045&id=1366964314 …
Yes but it needs to be a realistic issue.Until you improve the #ACA specifically access to care proposing #MedicareForAll doesn't make sense
Just do it. All lives depend on it. No one can afford premiums as they are. You will be a true hero if you make this happen #SinglePayerNow
Free health care for illegals!
Then why don't you support first getting ride of the disaster of ACA and replace it with one that could work. Tory reform is needed.
You have to sit down with Chuck and get him on board!!  Or he's toast!!
Wish this was brought after ACA has been secured. Bernie has a point but it distracts at a critical point. Flashback to HRC campaign.
#SavetheACA

Stop following loser Sanders & his never-gonna-pass ego 'bill'.

Keep your eye on real priority: the ACA

Plus: Medicare sucks.
Stop diluting and diminishing the convo about the ACA by going along with Sanders' PR stunt.
Free markets are far superior. More freedom, choice, competition and lower prices. Buy the coverage wanted. SINGLE PAYER=SOCIALISM.
Work on fixing the ACA and stopping Graham Cassidy. Not all of us want nor believe that Medicare for all is the answer yet. Forget Bernie.
Amen! Vote NO to #GrahamCassidy!
Really because I would think it would be fixing the ACA, and stopping the Graham Cassidy bill. Things that will happen &help us immediately
Media care doesn't pay politician a dime,why do you think they don't pass a good plan? When the money is right they follow
I don't think the Dems will win this fight w/ minorities in both chambers. Until Oct. 1st the focus should be blocking Graham-Cassidy bill.
Who will pay for it? How will the transition be made? When you back a plan, please make sure it is deliverable
Who's paying for it?
Just when have u been across NY U haven'tleft Wasington since u got there  screwing up healthcare like the rest
I just now learned about you. All I see you doing is ways to add debit. If you want all these programs ,please find a way to pay for them.
Can we please first work to kill the Graham-Cassidy bill? We've got a clear and present danger right now. #SaveOurCare
Just listened to you on PodSaveAmerica.  You have great ideas, and a sweet voice!
Thank-you for your service.
Healthcare shouldn't be a partisan issue? Wait, what? Ur team eliminated ur Delphi constituents healthcare while ToppingUp union's! & u say?
Thank you Senator Gillibrand for co sponsoring the #MedicareForAll. @chuckschumer when can we count on your support? @BernieSanders
You never came to my area and NO! Don't want the government involved in my business
I've talked to people and what's clear to me is healthcare should not be a govt issue. Everything the govt touches turns to crap.
Healthcare shouldn't be a government issue.
I am one of the people you are fighting for.  Thank you.  Very grateful.
Thank you for doing the right thing. Still waiting on @SenSchumer.
Don't let them pass the #NoCare Cassidy-Graham bill.  We're counting on you to stop it.
should be individual issue, I'll take care of me, you take care of you, I'll keep my hands out of your pocket, you keep yours out of mine
No it should not.
No more Health care for anyone We need to lower the national debt and decrease the population.
Absolutely correct!
Healthcare also shouldn't be taxpayers paying for those refusing to work. Bury the middle-class even more, nice work
We are already paying for it.
...and She just wants to increase our payments, or haven't you read the plan?
Who RU talking about?
Get government out of healthcare Quit raising the debt and writing checks u can't pay.  Tell the unions you want to replace their healthcare
Healthcare should be non profit.
....except Planned Parenthood of course
Medicare for all is not about being a right but about a  basic respect for all citizens.Make America healthy again. Show the world who is #1
With respect, Senator: please focus on protecting the health care we have, and save the debate about the future for later.
Amongst voters it isn't.
I Agee. Sit down and fix it. Do your job and stop listening to George Soroes

@GOP
The best way to make healthcare non partisan is to get government & partisan self serving politicians out of it.
If only GOP MOC recognized that. Never seen a group of people so bent on destroying so many of the people they serve.
Hi @SenGillibrand ... as a Nyer why are you carrying such a soft stick, you need to be more vocal, it's time to be a force in the Senate!!
Health care shouldn't be a government issue at all
It's not a right. I don't want to pay for everyone's insurance just my family.  Stop trying to control people.
You are part of a bulk pack that likely already reduces ur premiums. Unless ur very sick ur already paying more than lowest possible.
I am fine with paying my premiums. I want the government out of healthcare.
Big Pharma made it partisan. Follow the money and tell us how we will ever be single payer with campaign contributions being what they are.
Big pharma and insurance agencies donate heavily. Ryan could simply not bring it to the floor, not that it would pass anyway.
Not should our freedom be taken away. No socialized medicine
No it should not! We have insurance and medical bills still forced us into bankruptcy!
No!  The Federal government should NOT be in healthcare!
the .@GOP will fight you tooth and nail. stick to your beliefs
We all realize that single payer is the only viable option. If there was something better that works, we would have it by now.  #SinglePayer
Well make sure to tell them that Graham/Cassidy bill is closer to becoming law than single payer, because of the roll out fiasco of SP
Yes. But right now need to focus on #StopGrahamCassidy. People are confused by M4all push while GOP issues even worse bill w/ 2 weeks left.
Please, Senator, help spread the word about how dangerous this is! #stopGrahamCassidy
If we could just get the racist poison out of our government from the left an or right our gov. Could function as it should it's tainted!!!!
Everyone already can get healthcare what you really mean is insurance for all.
No, it shouldn't be partisan. Now get with the president on fixing what the last administration created
Please fix ACA.
Then don't make it a federal issue.
But not a socialist program either, remember NY & CA most liberal so you need to look beyond reason DNC lost people want free market 
So how is it that @SenSchumer has come to a different conclusion representing the same constituents?
because schumer is an ass
Can we concentrate on protecting the ACA right now fewer people suffer and die waiting for Medicare for All?
Defending the ACA is a given.
How can we get your colleague @SenSchumer on board?
He probably is not on board because he knows it won't pass this House. If 2018 flips Congress then M4A would be more viable.
