Bill Clinton signed an Executive Order giving control of our National Park's to the UN
Yep! Selling U.S.
Really fun video to watch for those who love the outdoors. How many of these places have YOU visited?
Love this message! I always wanted to be a Ranger, I am the soul of John Muir & all the Native peoples of this land.

Privately managed National Parks refuse Golden Senior passes.  Stop letting private companies exploit American Seniors.
