I'll join @SenatorShaheen & my colleagues this week in introducing bipartisan legislation to permanently repeal the #GlobalGagRule.
Thank you both! The rule hurts poor women in other countries and serves no practical purpose. THANK YOU!!!!!
less than 1% of budget is foreign aid. Seems fair for wealthiest country in the world.
Then maybe rich people should start paying their fair share of taxes.
Why discredit the man all the time? His intentions are only the best, and will suffice in the end.
That is not true. Has nothing to do with accessing clinics, it bars the clinics from promoting abortion.
But American women voted for Trump so they must be happy with the gag rule. Except #WomensMarch
@LisaBrenner2 @HuffPostPol @SenSanders @SenFranken @SenWarren @amyklobuchar I think Trump is just starting his war on women.
The entire GOPDTRR. #StayWokeAndFight
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol love @realDonaldTrump he's the best!!!
Senator why are we responsible for taking care of women around the world?
Because we are or were #1.The GOPDT doing everything in their power to insure that we are not. #ThisisWhyWeMarch
I'm a woman, but as a citizen of the world and an international college counselor, sadly I know 
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol Men signing a bill that is about women's health is pathetic. Their arrogance disgusts me.
We need a hero to stop him.
I say again, examine what they are against, then see who it hurts. Don't have to be a genius to figure.
Does this mean we stop sending aid to Israel since they promote abortions?
--certainly do NOT love this! Must keep our eyes on POTUS & protect women
Please oppose appointment of Betsy vos for Education Secretary.
Thank you.
Why should we pay for abortions for other countries? #AmericaFirst
@sheilad715 @HuffPostPol Not sure who is most disgusting... Trump or his voters. #resistance #notmypresident
Please vote NO to appointment of Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary
this is a great start. Pro life!
that purposeful misguiding language. No one restricts access to "repro care", the governments stops funding abortions.
Actions without considering consequences is pure Trump, no depth, no intelectual curiosity. Harm isn't a factor.
so it begins. We must work to save Womens rights and the  valuable organizations that offer reproductive care
It's tragic enough that 50mil+ American babies have been slaughtered since Roe v Wade, why export it, Ms Mengele
March on Houston 2/5. They stop Healthcare, we stop #SuperBowl #ImarchwithLinda #WomensMarch #globalgagrule
just wrong !
: keep fighting please! Your constituents & the country need you to help resist!
TRUMPS GET BACK AT WOMEN & PEOPLE'S MARCH SATURDAY! HE'S WAGED WAR ON WOMEN! POST WWII RUSSIA! AND EAST EUROPE!!
#ProtectOurCare #Shameful
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol  You would think that there are women amongst those who voted for DT. Puzzling.
@Mangoluu @HuffPostPol Abortion on demand ! For tr*oink's* mom. 70 some-odd years ago.
Why should Americans fund women around the world. How about taking care of our vets and seniors?
Thank you. A gag won't stop abortions, just make them dangerous. Trust the doctors we support to care for all women.
Good. It needed to be
Please tell me you're exaggerating just a little bit for the sake of your agenda?  #libtards
please fight him, im a constituent
Please keep fighting for your constituents against this callousness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVw6iwmXvZY&t=1s …
are you going to pay fo them personally? Didn't think so. Put your money where your mouth is if u care so much(which u don't)
An 80's flashback, and a horrible one.
This will INCREASE the number of abortions!  What is wrong with these people?!
@ateacher97 Endangered women's, people dealing with aids and more this is the work of the Heritage Foundation and Pence
Women are going to die with this.
PRO LIFE PRESIDENT FINALLY!  Thank God.
@POTUS And our President loves women?  Gee, thanks.  So very little respect!
Because nothing unites wary Republicans quite like invoking the spirit of Saint Ronald, huh?
@bjorkianrice @SenGillibrand @Pandaphant1 Ah Reagan, psychic readings, IranContra, S&L crisis, wait why do they like him again?
Raised taxes 11 times legalized abortion in CA.
was president of a union fer chrissakes, the liebrul hollyweird SAG

#ThisisWhyWeMarch
thank you senator. Please pursue this ban.
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol  simply is Revenge against the woman's much this man is f****** dangerous
@blogdiva @HuffPostPol Ironic. Considering Trumps mother shouldve had an abortion. Wonder if its 2 late 4 her #GlobalGagRule
apparently +/- 1 million women march wasn't enough for him. I say let's make it bigger next time!
When do you realize this is why we elected @POTUS #Outin18
Here's an idea-it's called personal self control--be smart--
Too bad his parents didn't have birth control

> million women marching & #Trump admin. response is #Globalgagrule?
Givernament should be away of abortion issues let He and She solve the problem
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol Ironically he signed this 2 days after the Women's March. It is a slap in the face.
Well they elect a Sociopath what did they expect.?
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol it's the beginning of the end for us :(
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol We lose our humanity when we turn our backs on the less fortunate.
hey trump, so you never paid for your mistress' abortions? Note abortionS, plural.
The poor children who are raped
boooo!
@DavidCornDC does the Fistula Foundation get funding here?
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol
Spicer said that Today's Federal Hiring Freeze "Counters the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years- Alternative Fact! 
let them pay for their own abortions
WTF - this man is totally insane,
This is outrageous! I'm enraged & against the Gagrule#NoGagRule4abortionServices
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol I will NEVER understand where men feel they have the right to. Decide s woman's personal issue
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol @realDonaldTrump does not care about women.
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol potus is a self proclaimed sexual predator, what I'm I missing?
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol Well, PPtRump's parents should have used birth control.
@davidcorndc But your republican white male counterparts still get their boner pills covered by insurance right Seanator?
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol he is a shame and embarrassment
@DavidCornDC Can't wait until they outlaw all wars and the death penalty too..
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol disgusting.
@DavidCornDC @HuffPostPol right after millions of women marched. Tone deaf & beyond reach in terms of duty to constituents
I don't think his supporters care about anything other than their wallets.  The world loses.
why should we be paying for abortion and birth control in Mexico
why should Tax dollars pay for abortions overseas. Tax dollars don't pay for abortions for Americans right?
Thank you Ms Gillbrand, we keep fighting. now you "girls 4 bernie" Happy? #GlobalGagRule #WomensMarch #Resistance
@csilberman70 @HuffPostPol If you love PP,donate to PP. We the taxpayer don't want to.
And you wonder why we marched.  Pathetic.
and the war on women continues and people sit idly by
tragic to see grinning white men sentence women around the world to death. What does @IvankaTrump think?
must not let this pass
Stop throwing our money away you Globalist hack! @HuffPostPol
he's a disgrace!
Senator, I hope we can count on you & Senator Schumer to relentlessly resist this Admin"s regressive policies.
@HuffPostPoll many women in other countries are raped & disowned having babies out of wedlock and they get no financial help
respectfully many Americans voted for Trump to support thisI do not want to pay for abortions anywhere
he didn't restrict anything other than the US not telling other countries what to do with their own citizens.
we're not going to give our money to orgs in other countries to perform abortions.
Think again...you fund abortions in Israel
http://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-abortion-law-now-among-worlds-most-liberal/ …
that article is from Jan 6, 2014. Trumps exec order will stop sending tax money to orgs that do abortions other countries.
This cannot happen.
Active response from @womensmarch? Come on, people! Don't let us be the Liberal Tea Party! We must DO SOMETHING.
@ProgressOutlook @HuffPostPol sounds like #GlobalBlackmail
stop the fear mongering. How about promoting term limits for congress and senate. Career politicians need to go.
Sure Senator Suuuuurrrrrreeee.
@POTUS & @GOP care nothing abt women! Thank u senator for standing up 4 what's right
you need to do all you can to stop this guy !!
With that we go back to the '80s. Can the '50's be far behind
1850's
how is this a bad thing? He stopped US taxes from paying for it. THANK YOU @realDonaldTrump
I hope those extra 5 cents in your pocket are worth women dying. Well done
why not spend it on saving lives here instead? I don't have "extra" money and that's the point. Neither does US.
global gag rule doesn't actually save the US any money. It just means if u take our $ don't talk about abortion. It kills people
seems to give a choice from what you said. If you want our money it wont be used this way. DOES NOT KILL ANYONE... JUST DUMB
no, the $ doesn't go to abortion either way. It just means doctors can't talk about abortion with patients
or they can choose to talk and provide any procedure without US funding....very simple to see choices
Our tax dollars shouldn't be used to fund healthcare around the world. We are 20 trillion in debt. Donate to @UNICEF
I trust that you support Senator Shaheen's legislation? https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/shaheen-statement-on-president-trumps-reinstatement-of-the-global-gag-rule …
