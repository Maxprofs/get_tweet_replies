Climate change is real. Sea levels are rising, and I've seen firsthand how violent weather has devastated communities in New York.
Contaminants in our water and air threaten New Yorkers' public health. Our children and families' lives and health are at stake.
Scott Pruitt will not be vigilant on these issues—in fact, his record is hostile to them. He will not get my vote to lead the @EPA.
I'm genuinely shocked. Huge surprise. Big league move, Kirsten
please please keep that in mind upon voting for Pruitt
.@SenGillibrand @EPA What global average temperature do you want and why? Can we tweak CO2 to achieve that temperature?
Wrong question! Right question: how much longer do we have to save life on Earth before CO2 kills everything?
Forever
Please note that I said living things, not the planet. Try again. (The planet has 5B yrs +/-)
which doesn't refute what I said
You say the living things will live forever? I say all living things are at risk bcz of CO2.
Living things love CO2, especially plants
Yes but they only live w/in a limited range of temps. CO2=temps=end of all living things.
I seem to remember republicans using former senator Gregg rules of mucking things up in the senate use his philosophy
@sheenA_8886 @EPA will you go ahead and announce your Presidential candidacy please.
@ungaggedEPA @EPA Thank you, Senator!

Well, the WH is getting rid of the EPA...HORRIBLE

Also, environmental regulation makes and supports jobs... lots of jobs.
@altUSEPA @EPA Another canned statement carefully crafted by a comms team. Jesus, get an original script PLEASE
Did you get my tweet on ELE brewing in the Arctic – Methane emission http://ameg.me/  check it out
@itsmommy @EPA Well we could be breathing poisonous gases & drinking  Cholera because they've been censured. #WEAR-A-MASK
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A MYTH

The EPA failed to protect the planet from global warming. It's time to replace the EPA.
Keep fighting for us Senator!
absolutely!  Keep on voting no Kirsten! They want someone who hates the environment to lead the EPA? No way!
Thank u very much, &GOD Bless u always!!! U bring up very dire issue, air&water +the planet!
@altUSEPA @EPA thank you
.@SenGillibrand to bad they stopped long ago. #hoosickfalls #Flint & on & on  @altUSEPA @EPA
@altUSEPA @EPA yes!! Please stand strong for truth in science, environmental protection and our planet's health!!
@altUSEPA @EPA please tell Ryump!
While people should agree. POTUS does not read. does not suffer from the issues of " bad air" 200K die early in Texas
So what are you going to do to save it?  We need you to stand up and fight, Senator.
Funny democrats bust on POTUS for tweeting but they are tweeting all kinds of lies about the cabinet pick. Hypocrites!
EPA is outta control
And you're a senator so you're the line of defense even b4 them. Prevent bad secretaries. #nopruitt
thank you!!!! With no environment/water then what are we?
fight hard, listen to voters, prepare your exploratory committee now.
Above Look Up Trump and All Of You That Do Not  Think We Up In a Could Over You Now Beaming Down On All !
huh?
They  are Going To Be Paying The Pipe Pipers Thais Me and My Race We Will Make Them Suffer Before They Be Come  Dust
this is going to be an uphill battle with #Rejectpruitt
Our government wants to poison us to make money for billionaires. Black lung disease is no joke. Clean energy now.
If we don't have the EPA to look after air and water then who will we have? I don't want to have to wear gas masks.
@ungaggedEPA @EPA @SenCapito @Sen_JoeManchin Thank you! Your desire can not happen with Mr. Pruitt.
@tcarstens @EPA keep the good work. We need more like you
@SenateDems @senateGop you are better than #pruitt
you all just want to kill everything don't you?
YES!  Thank you Kirsten!!  Your sanity and commitment make me feel hopeful.  Thanks for all you do for us.  
you are doing a fine job opposing all of state cabinet pick.  Thank you!
TY Senator - Pruitt's replies in hearings less than believable, and worrisome. All too familiar here in Hoosick Falls
@CleanAirMoms will be back again today to show our opposition - we are with you @EPWDems
Make sure you tell the Donald.
We all have obligations to discharge with respect to the protection of the environment.
making the accountable shouldnt be difficult....
regulations meant to save our environment and lives
YES!
And protecting human health!
please do not let the protection of waterways from coal companies be overturned.
EPA should focus on real pollution, not fake claims of CO2 being a pollutant. They will then regain credibility.
What a nice sentiment. But unfortunately, the EPA is in the pockets of Bayer, etc... That's why pesticides are legal.  #bees
Have you searched for "watches porn at work at EPA"? http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/porn-watching-epa-employees-earning-120000-year-put-paid-administrative-leave … EPA is costly disappointment.

EPA failed to clean this up after many years. #Incompetent #EPA
Thank you Senator Gillibrand
Japan also tried to use coal for thermal power generation but abandoned it due to concern about global warming.
@EPA
I wonder if somehow can't develop a technology to stop smoke damage associated with burning coal?
@EPA
Well, we better stock up on water filters & breathing masks for the near future.
You mean the new Environmental Pollution Agency...?  Say goodbye to 

#ScottPruitt #RexTillerson #RussianOil #DAPL #KXL
thank u for standing for us Sen G
.@SenGillibrand .@EPA How do we fight if they keep changing the rules to suit their financial goals? this is a #Coupdetat
All of us need to be the extra eyes for them. It's our we are in this together
we're quickly approaching the point when we'll be thankful our lawmakers recognize that the sun rises in the east.
Trump said that was fake news also world is flat. The Chinese are doing this..

Thank you for standing up against Harmful Nominees and for the EPA
Run for President 2020 #GILLIBRAND2020
Don't forget the @NOAA! The broader view that contextualizes the immediate threats & helps project potential issues....
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand, for being the 1st line of defense in the US Senate, and showing your colleagues the way.
Thank you Senator.
thanks for standing up for our future #RejectPruitt
.@SenGillibrand @EPA you can't even keep Long Island clean!
Thank you for everything you do for justice.
is lit! get them girl!  @EPA
the GOP has made it perfectly clear they are going to decimate the EPA
instead of climate change, you need to worry about this country's morals.
We should focus on local communities to take care as well.  The EPA is to broad and many cases slip through the cracks.
please do what you can to stand up to @LamarSmithTX21 Secret Science Reform Act. GOP garbage parading as transparency.
I'm with ya Senator.
holy shit, are you showing some self awareness??????????????????
#draintheswamp @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
And please ask @realDonaldTrump why he thinks we must sacrifice clean air & water in exchange for jobs?!
New Yorkers are behind you Senator
You are correct.  Please keep up the good work. We are counting on you!!!
Sadly you seem to be one of the few dems left in Washington with any backbone..
I used to think this went without saying.
YOURE MY HERO!!!! #ImpeachTrump #StandUpToTrump #StopPresidentBannon
