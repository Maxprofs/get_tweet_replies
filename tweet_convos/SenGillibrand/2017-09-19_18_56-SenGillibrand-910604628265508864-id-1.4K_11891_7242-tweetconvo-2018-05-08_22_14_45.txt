So basically it ditches the people who need the health care.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @GOP are sacks of America we must, must vote this Party out of office #GOP willing 2Kill 30 million Americans
these men all look like poorly executed caricatures.
Concessions need to be made....would be nice for others instead of individual payers for a change
Great job @realDonaldTrump    #DEPLORABLES,  I hope none of you become pregnant or are currently ill. BTW 2 more coal mines are closing


which is why gop keeps blocking investigations into voter fraud & election tampering by russia
Trump has wanted the voter recount

Stop the FAKENEWS. The bill does not stop states from making preexisting conditions mandatory once they get their block grant. #shameonAP
I thought the previous round was the last ditch? This is exhausting.
Good idea: cut insurance for the sick, mentally ill, drug addicted, and pregnant.  #VoteNo
They're going to need new jobs if they pass this.
That would be true in a democracy where your elected representatives actually represented your best interests.
All the bill does is remove all the mandates of Obamacare and shift control of health care plans from the federal govt to states #shameonAP
I guess the YEAs will live with it. They'll be shunned at home, a really inhumane act, but how can anyone associate with inhumane guys?
What a shitshow, not fair
Evert successive plan they say is better than the last,  must grade by number losing health care
I think listing the losers may take years.
People who benefit from the GOP healthcare bill: insurance companies who dont have to pay for as much and the people whose pockets they line
DING DING DING We have a winner!  U hit the nail on the head! This is the work of the greedy devious insurance companies lobbying congress!
I couldn't say all of that and make it fit in 140 characters. I tried

These MotherFU%kers Should have to USE THE SAME Healthcare SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT...
Catastrophic works fine, and nobody disses pregnant women either. Get a grip.  Obamacare sucks really bad,  it's gotta go.
I can understand people not liking ACA. I can understand people wanting something better. I cannot understand anyone who supports this.
Not a single woman in that picture let alone a pregnant one. Please let women make laws affecting male health.
How could we be looking at this awful bill again?
I have made phone calls to my own Senators as well as swing R Senators...hoping it makes a difference.
Every week it's like this. We have to beg our own government every week not to kill us. What kind of life is this? Why, America?

Call your Senators
The republicans would kick the crutches out from underneath tiny tim to get a 'victory ' right now.
@LindseyGrahamSC You may have a comic side to you that people enjoy; this is definitely not funny, in any way!
I'm curious if the families of Senate/House members will be forced to be on this plan?
Oh, no!  They have a great plan that we pay for. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP. I think they should be forced to use it.

Glad to see him rip Cassidy -> Jimmy Kimmel: 'Bill Cassidy Lied To My Face' http://crooksandliars.com/2017/09/jimmy-kimmel-bill-cassidy-lied-my-face … via @crooksandliars
Independent analysts say the latest Senate Republican bill is likely to leave more people uninsured than the Affordable Care Act. GOP hate u
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Why are they doing this?
Look at these white men ruining lives. Embarrassing.  Deeply wrong.
I am a college educated white woman who carries the insurance for my family. My premiums, deductibles and copays are unmanageable now!
No to birth control, and triple-no to taking care of your baby.  Yeah, boy, those family values of  the party of @realDonaldTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @DeanHeller @SenateMajLdr 

WILL KILL CHILDREN FOR $400 MILLION IN KOCH CASH

Don't we need pregnant women?
College educated married females(Voted for Trump) have their spouse's insurance. This hurts single and minority women.

Uneducated white women predominantly voted for Trump.
Yes indeed as did uneducated white men. In fact all are actually entitled & often floating on the farm economy as owners or servicers, etc
The irony is that the farm community floats on subsidies that would be called welfare if offered in cities.
Yes, because NY and CA Senators know how to take care of folks in WY an ND.
So then the people who need it the most lose out??? What has happened to our humanity?
These old white men seem OK with that.
Shame on all of you. Cruel and partisan.
Cassidy always seems to be laughing about this...
Discouraged that the GOP don't see how important health care services are to people planning to screw the public again
Just look at those smug, old white men who can't explain the concept of insurance looking pleased with themselves.
The "pro-life" party seeks to cut off health care for pregnant women.
People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
let's not forget kids on Medicaid, special needs kids and Chips kids. Pro life indeed #deplorable
Noone  in Canada has ever been denied healthcare because of pre-existing conditions.   It is discrimination.  Utterly disgusting.
Well said, and kudos to #Canada @DrTedros @WHO
Care to comment? @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @GOP
No one loses the plan they purchase with their own money.
What does this even mean?
It means one only has the right to the medical coverage one pays for with money they've earned themselves.
So you’re against insurance as a concept?
Not at all. I'm against AP misleading its readers about the impact of changes to a welfare plan.
Ah yes, of course. How principled.
An unprincipled man is as trustworthy as a thief.
It - as I understand it - will ELIMINATE Medicaid by 2016 - many of our veterans depend on this.
Can't eliminate something in the past. I think u mean 2026
It's the same thing.  Profits at the expense of peoples' lives.  What does society stand for, it not the health and life of its citizens?
For these guys, profit for their patrons and power for themselves. 
That's all society means to them.
Great diversity of decision makers again, I see.
As a b/c survivor will pay a 28k surcharge yearly. GOP GENOCIDE. Systemic cleanse od kids,old,poor,women &pre-existing cond. MOST OF US
This health plan GOP wants to bestow on  us is disgusting
Thank you for standing for us as you always do! A better system in place to UPDATE us on things wld be GREAT!!! #resist #impeach45
Such a nice group of commie pinkos... traitors all.
@SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley @RepDavidYoung 
Don't make Iowans losers.
No on #GrahamCassidy
Do they even care about the people they represent?
Nope@
Yes but what do we do abt it. Other than tweeting.
Call all the senators. It's better then doing nothing. Just wait till one of their supporters gets cancer and has to die because of no $$
Cliff notes version: People that get sick and need health lose.
These are some mean boys! They could give a s#!+ about their constituents .
I thought fetuses had a right to life. Guess not.
I didn’t see anything where it said that pregnant women can’t be covered or that hospitals could turn away people.
Who pays for the hospital care?
Same people that pay for illegals who get care.   Taxpayers.  Or they get a bill and if they are citizens they get their credit screwed up
Gee, Just heard Bill's sponsor saying there is a specific provision requiring States to cover pre-existing conditions. But what does he know
The specific provision allows for pre-existing conditions to be charged at a higher rate -- or, yes, denied coverage completely.
ne of the authors of the bill will be on Fox New in just a few minutes to discuss. You might want to give it a listen. Then, we will see
Fox News?  You say that with a straight face?
Another point: About a month Harvard University, I will say that again, Harvard University, did a study of negative news re Trump . . . .
It's another bad idea by GOP.
#CASSIDY ACTUALLY THINKS IT'S FUNNY THAT PEOPLE WILL DIE UNDER HIS BILL--#GOP=#HATEDparty!!!
Well I suppose pregnant women should just suck it up. Men shouldn't have to pay for something they have no connection too. 
#thisistrump
Outrageous! Vote NO
Well Trump did say he loved the uneducated.  Ignorance is his natural constituency.
Misogyny! If men could get pregnant, this wouldn't be a preexisting condition. GOP block women's access to healthcare at every opportunity.
Lol...
they want to take away abortion rights and healthcare for women who have babies.  Why the assault on women? US has zero moral high ground.
Praying that all of these guys eventually wear adult diapers.
Kansans: Don't give up on @JerryMoran He voted against ACA repeal b4 citing impact of Medicaid cuts on rural hospitals, disabled. Call/email
Also remember, this bill does not effect the Members of the GOP at all, the totally excepted them self from it. They well get the
And you know who wins? Insurance Companies!!! They yugely win...big big win...the bigest win anyone has ever seen...FFS! Enough already!!!
Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and the rest of you thugs  give up your insurance you are a bunch of cowards
Protect you & your family. VOTE OUT all @GOP who support the Graham-Cassidy Bill!!! 

Your vote is your life. @DNC
They really people. The worst kind of people right here.
These guys want to let everyone defend for themselves!
.@LindseyGrahamSC .@BillCassidy, don't know why you hate #US, women, children, and elderly in particular but your mothers' are not proud!
Viagra still covered!
We just have to pass the bill to see what's in it.
@SenateDems @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain  This is not ok!
Start removing coverage on these 7 people first then we'll decide if it's good for the rest of America
Or in their callous and cold hearts, die, and "decrease the surplus population".
Scrooges all, no Spirit of Xmas likely
Why this cruelty?! Why, why, why?
We're all waiting for the AP to report on the millions who lost out when Obamacare became law. Instead ... silence.
Are we getting our moneys worth from these politicians? I don't think their looking out for the American ppl! Hmmmm
That's what they have security for. "Look out! American people!"
None of the Congress folks care about people - vote them out. Millions will become infirmed, financially bankrupt, or die because of them.
Uneducated people voted for Trump period.
Great way to drain that swamp.
So much ugliness
@SenatorIsakson his is not a good bill for ....
Obviously non of these men came out of a vagina they came out of hell, btw there is a reserved spot for their return
Why is it that they all are white and they all look impotent? Little Blue Pill is still covered?
The GOP are the other party of Marxists who keep the PC rule over us by providing the ILLUSION of choice --

if all of a sudden humanity had to distribute AIR
It would be unthinkable that only the wealthy had it
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayer 
@LindseyGrahamSC  @BillCassidy @GOP @SenateGOP and you people had the nerves to call POTUS Obama's bill a death bill...smh...
if you want something get a job and earn it you are not entitled to anything in this world
So basically again a full on attack on women's health by old white men. #Trump1stkills Vote NO on Cassidy-Graham call your Senators NOW
If 3 Rep. Senators drop dead tonight, it wd save millions of lives & prevent the suffering of millions more! Most wd call that a miracle!
A NATION BETRAYED DOH SHIPMAN NEVER ENDED PROF LIAM DOBALDSON PROF DAVIES JHUNT DR GEDDES   DEPOPULATE NEW WORLD ORDER POLICE FREEMASONRY
Stop faking indifference and news.
DEATH CARE, THE BILL THAT KILLS.!!
If they don't cover pregnancy women may revolt and cut off every male
@SenJohnMcCain Americans only want what you & GOP have - peace of mind for their family & themselves should they become ill.
@RepTomPrice @SenJohnMcCain @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr #ACASavesLives @BillCassidy #trumpcare2 @LindseyGrahamSC
White males, void of any moral compass, coercing huge tax breaks for a very few by taking from our most vulnerable.
#Disgusting
This picture of old, crotchety men tells the whole story.
#ABRB ( A Bunch of Republican Bitches.)
@LindseyGrahamSC
WHO BOUGHT YOUR INTEGRITY, COMPASSION and PATRIOTISM?
Hope it was worth it.
You're going 2die a lonely lonely man.
#RIPGOP
@LindseyGrahamSC Your party has become soulless and cruel.  There will be a day when you and your Repubs will have to account for your greed
@HeatherWhaley Everyone of these assholes in the picture need they're dirty ass kicked to the curb and voted out!!The no good FUCKS?????
In other words, over half of those who sign up potentially.
Back to the good old days where DV was considered a pre-existing condition by some insurance companies??...
@SenatorCollins - if you vote for this, you will be proven to be a liar and I should be allowed to NOT pay for your healthcare.
Jesus must be so proud.  @GOP
Who is that smirking guy in the picture? He looks downright evil
now just to save money, and be able to give the rich tax cuts.
Winners: Insurance companies and rich people. 

Losers: The poor and sick. 

Just how @GOP likes it
All those republicans should be fucking shot than hanged by their empty ball sacks for the cowards they are. They sold out America.
Wow, calling for the murder of political opponents is a nazi tactic. You're a disgusting nazi
are they as bad off as the 28 million left uninsured by the ACA? #singlepayer.
The Winner is @GOP so they can say they fulfilled a 9 yr camp promise at the expense ofcitizens! Their billionaires will then keep funding
Why are all the Pro Life™ lunatucs not out screaming about how this will hurt unborn babies?
what is truly wrong with these people?  Promoting deathcare for those of us with pre-existing conditions
Hello Dawn how are you doing ?
Outrages daily from this @GOP. They hate women, the elderly, the disabled, the ill. They worship money. They worship power.

@BillCassidy @LindseyGrahamSC @lisamurkowski @SenJohnMcCain So - you've decided to punish sick people & pregnant women to reward donors?
White people are the ones who befits more from #ObamaCare
These men in this picture are vile. @RoyBluntMO
These asshole white men suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why would anyone ever trust a single thing from a group of geriatrics that look like melted candles and moldy old jack-o'-lanterns
This is what voting Republican gets you folks...butchers!
Explain this - why would @SenJohnMcCain vote against his best friends @LindseyGrahamSC health care proposal? We don't have 3 NOs
I assume each of theses creeps have Mothers,wives, daughters.
Bunch of butchers getting at innocent life's who handed them power to protect them. Very 
Shocking to anyone not paying attention since forever.
Thanks @BillCassidy 
All losers
Only those who are breathing lose

If you had cancer diagnosis prev'ly-even if unfounded-ur premiums increase 3451%

Monthly.
Nice work GOP, your efforts combined with those of #CaveManTrump will wipe the GOP off the map for the next decade #IdiocyIsContagious

GOP leadership had previously set aside $45 billion in additional funds to fight the opioid epidemic. Now it’s gone http://thebea.st/2fx2aWn  
All ugly selfish white men...

@GOP I don't understand what the GOP has against average Americans, but Legislative Genocide healthcare is Un-American!! @LindseyGrahamSC
What a disgraceful pack of wolves trying to tear our healthcare system apart .
However Members Of #Congress can have a #Disease Like #Cancer & get the best care EX #JohnMcCain! #MayoClinic #SinglePayerNow
Gop are some real evil mfs
@lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain This BILL is BAD for women.  Shame on @LindseyGrahamSC  VOTE NO!
Hard to find that many turds off the barnyard.
Sad what you are attempting to do to Americans
#shameonthem
This picture just about sums it up
Look at them giddy to bring misery and death to millions. Cowards and fools.
So basically the people who actually need insurance the most won't be covered. Seems like a smart plan to me!
Dead in the water bill. Epic fail for the #GOP
Don't be so sure.
You know what my provider covers now? Nothing till I pay 8k.
How could any senator explain voting for a bill opposed by the AARP & AMA? Rationale? $$$$ from lobbyists. GOP is the swamp.
Repeal & Replace the @GOP!
Correction: there are no winners.

The rich driving us to a 2-class society will end up paying very very dearly for their shortsightedness.
JUST A BUNCH OF RICH OLD MEN WHO WANT TO KILL OFF THE REST OF US WITH NO HEALTH CARE PROVISIONS;GREEDY, SELFISH, THINK ONLY OF THEMSELVES
These clowns sent me a request for money, to help pay for Trump and his family's legal team! I left their party last year but they troll!
AP is biased reporting...
Vote NO on this bill @SenToomey   It's wrong for Pennsylvania (lose $131B) & our country (36M people lose coverage). Fix the ACA!
@kairyssdal As Sen. Graham states, "We’ve come upon an idea that is uniquely Republican.” A bill with flaws that would hurt countless.
Life is now a pre existing condition.
All sour pusses .....except that one guy to Graham's left
He may have gas
That shit-eating grin on Cassidy's face is the icing on this turd the GOP keeps trying to polish and sell as a viable ACA replacement..
Old white men at their finest.Their desperation to destroy Obama Care is sickening! @johncornyn @SenTedCruz, @GOP @lisamurkowski
I've lived in four countries, all of which had free healthcare and were economically stable.

Why does the US struggle so much with this?
False. But people discriminated against for disabilities should have sued 30 years ago when Americans with Disabilities Act passed.
Evil
Of course. We can't have abortions. God forbid we ever get pregnant.
Everyone should tell there senators if you. It's our rates to go up. You will be out
