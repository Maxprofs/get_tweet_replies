Tonight #BetsyDeVos would not oppose putting guns in our schools. I was shaken to the core by her answer. So should every American parent.
or you make it easier for mentally unstable family members to get guns and shoot up schools. But whatevs
well would you rather be shot by a student?
Will you be opposing her nomination? She is totally unfit. Please release a statement!
Oh, but  what about the grizzlies?
@ChrisMurphyCT At least the gun issue is over a difference of opinion. DeVos' lack of knowledge about IDEA is pure ignorance.
Sen Gillibrand, please stand strongly against Betsy DeVos. We will be behind you 100% @SenGillibrand
well, you know, there could be grizzlys and such
@ChrisMurphyCT bahahahahahaha, bahahahaha, bahahahahahaha, bahahahahaha, can't stop...bahahaha
-have u ever wondered if teachers/admin victims of school shootings wished they had a gun to defend themselves and kids?
@ChrisMurphyCT I Agree with you!
@ChrisMurphyCT Betsy DeVos is a threat to the many kids who rely on FAPE and the many kids who rely on local public schools.
-Only thing that stops a "bad guy" w/ a gun is a "good guy" w/ a gun.Arm responsible teachers/school admin to protect our kids
@ChrisMurphyCT I'm a constituent and this is beyond concerning. Does she think our kids' safety is a joke? #DumpDevos
Are you prepared to vote against this appointment? I'm an educator in upstate New York.
So does this mean a no vote? Her Impact on kids with disabilities would be devastating now and for generations forward
will you vote yes or no on DeVos?  Your office won't say, will u? Teachers want to know
Yeah, but bears!  ;-)
Please let your voice be heard & do not vote for B. Devos!! She is incapable of doing the job, thank you @SenGillibrand @ChrisMurphyCT
Less than 50 years ago tiny citizens were educated on gun safety & use for protection of self & family. Never had any issues.
Our youth also showed great respect 4 law enforcement who as part of public service proudly did this @ all the local schools.
Yawn. Gun free zones where people get killed....
@megmarrrero This is the way to kill history. #anticivicscreateschaos very disappointed
@ChrisMurphyCT Haven't you understood she don't care for schools, specially public schools and non rich kids
@ChrisMurphyCT thank you for fighting for what is right and safe for Americans
I'm a cert. Hypnotist and psych RN from near Pittsburgh. How do we move forward w this tyrant? I offered to hypno him!
time 2insist the US Capitol Police,who protectU and other  members of Congress,surrender their guns @door just like schools
-protected by armed US Capitol Police,doesn't understand our children in school deserve similar protection.Arm teachers/admin
@ChrisMurphyCT please block this nomination! Vote NO to DeVos!
My son's school has persons with guns. I feel safer. Less likely a nut job or muslim bent on jihad will enter the door there
@ChrisMurphyCT schools & gun free zones are so soft hence targets, put good guys with guns on campus & school is less soft
@ChrisMurphyCT  the Ohio State terrorist didn't do more damage because a good guy with a gun & good aim was on campus
Not concerning, come out and say totally unqualified. Stand up and just say NO.
@AhBarn @ChrisMurphyCT could @realDonaldTrump made a worse choice for education?
DeVos is troubling. Period.
lmao, guns for schools, you only want gun control to control the population, gun free= sitting ducks.
@ChrisMurphyCT what can we do to help! This appointment cannot be confirmed!!
her support of conversion therapy is horrible. Not fit to run education department
@ChrisMurphyCT Her responses were appalling.  #fearfulforAmericanChildrenInSchools
@ChrisMurphyCT begging you to say a strong "NO" to DeVos confirmation. Bad for children. Bad for teachers. Bad for schools.
@BruceLesley @ChrisMurphyCT "Very concerning". Ok I realize you're a senator, but c'mon, guns in school is nuts!
@ChrisMurphyCT vote this liberal quackjob out!!!
@mayread3 Her type can't react properly w/concern, empathy r compassion bcuz it didn't happen "to her" directly. Pathetic.
@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you Senators. This is a tough week - thanks for calling out the problems w these nominees.
Amen to your tweet! Totally agree!
@ChrisMurphyCT keep fighting!
@ChrisMurphyCT There are real grizzly bears in Kodiak, Alaska and children do not take guns to school.
@ChrisMurphyCT #Grizzlies

Sandy Hook kids were NOT protected by armed security
LIKE ALL OF YOU ON CAPITOL HILL!
You're fired Kirsten
@ChrisMurphyCT Gun free zones attract bad guys!
.@SenGillibrand @ChrisMurphyCT why tell DeVos, "You look forward to working with her." #SilenceIsGoldenYieldYourTimeBackAndMoveOn
@ChrisMurphyCT please stop Devoy. She is frightening
Liberty University teaches gun safety and has a gun range on campus.  LU is a safe place. Your propositional fallacy is an error in logic.
what does it take for you to realize that a law banning guns in schools does NOTHING to stop criminals??? @NYSRPA
@ChrisMurphyCT I cannot believe this person is being confirmed for this vital government post w/ zero relevant experience!
schools should be allowed to choose safety. Gun free zones invite violence.
time for Devos to make an exit!!! Not gonna make America great again.
@ChrisMurphyCT Liberal Vomit at work.
Which begs the question, what would ur plan look like? When u left for DC u left ur common sense & shotgun under the bed
@ChrisMurphyCT  guns make everyone safer.
that's interesting, because we have loads of guns in this country and it's certainly not as safe as many where guns are banned.
@ChrisMurphyCT your dismay is equal to your ignorance of the history of killers preying on gun free zones #2ndAmd
Evil doers ignore the gun free school signs.
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenSchumer @SenSanders I beg of you to all reject DeVos! Please from a very concerned mother in Upstate NY
@ChrisMurphyCT get over yourself already.
Senator please oppose the nominee, she is clearly unfit to assume this leadership position. Long Island resident
@ChrisMurphyCT this is a states rights issue. Keep the fed out of the states biz. Trying to ruin all states like NY?
yes, because a "gun free zone" sign will stop a shooting... #gunssavelives #tcot
she is totally and unquestionably unqualified uneducated and religion in schools. Express sadness wear black Friday
@ChrisMurphyCT - Guns in schools may have saved lives and then you would have nothing to bitch about.
DeVos is but one example of this illegitimate admin. So why are you attending the inauguration of FASCISM in America?
@ChrisMurphyCT but what if a bad bear comes in with a gun? None of our MANY good bears won't have anything!
Statistically, "gun free zones" are less safe. Maybe allowing a properly trained teacher or staff member to carry will help
exactly!
she has no concept of what happens in schools every day. She CANNOT be in charge.
@ChrisMurphyCT - because those mean grizzly bears may attack - 200+ school shootings - 0 grizzly bears ..
@ChrisMurphyCT posting gun free zones around schools is just to stupid to comprehend
I'm a public school special ed teacher, and she terrifies me. Please keep fighting against her confirmation.
there's a huge diff between having armed faculty and armed students. #termlimitsnow
Guess every school will need to be assigned a bear perhaps?  Make her go away!
I hope "safe space" doesn't mean "no ideas I disagree with or that make me feel unhappy even though factual"
Sorry but a "gun free school zone" sign hasn't worked either Tina. U used to know this when u were congresswoman.
Good guys with legal guns in schools stop bad guys and protect our children!
.@SenGillibrand Obviously you do not appreciate the seriousness of grizzlies! @ChrisMurphyCT
but GRIZZLY BEARS!
@ChrisMurphyCT This woman is nutzoid! It's apparent she has no young lives she's concerned about? She shouldn't procreate!
TRULY alarming....truly
@ChrisMurphyCT Dear Senator Gillibrand: Under our Constitution this is a question for the states to decide. You should know.
but the bears, Sen. Gillibrand, the bears!
Today: 11yo brings loaded gun to Somersworth NH school. No grizzly bear attacks, though. http://www.nh1.com/news/police-11-year-old-nh-student-brought-loaded-handgun-to-somersworth-middle-school/ â€¦
Trumpf and his whole lot are certifiable! Nutzoid!
@ChrisMurphyCT And it's now clear that children being shot and killed isn't enough to sway the GOP into action.
@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you, Senator.
Well, you know, the bears
