all women get healthcare unless there middle class then they got screwed bu higher then normal premiums.Low income gets it free
Your constituents are here to support you in that effort. Thank you, @SenGillibrand !
I'm so grateful you're my Senator - equally so for Sen. Schumer.  Proud to be a New Yorker. Highest regards and thank you!
YOU LIBERALS
#well aren't you just the saint of women's healthcare!
Thank you! Love & support from Amherst, NY!
SENATOR WOMAN ARE MORE DELICATE; THEY NEED MORE CARE !THATS WHY IN ANY HEALTHCARE BILL YOU MUST INTICIPATE FOR MORE SEVICES ;FOR WOMAN!
thank you
I cannot thank you enough for standing up against GOP'S repeal.
Notice how she said "Women" and nothing else.
It's men first.  That includes E.D. treatment.
Don't you mean access to murder their own child. How hateful and misguided you are. Abortion is murder!
maybe they should enter the work force and provide HC for themselves
Stay strong and loud and New York proud.
Thank you
Thank you for your leadership on this. You gives us hope in this medieval time.
As a NYC female constituent, I'm counting on you!
Get those brass ovaries out there !  Ladies we need to band together!
.
Good to hear.

What about ppl advocating divestiture of Israeli investments?  . Will you stand up/support them, or jail/fine them?
Thank you for representing me!
So, you're saying you'll do your job. You are so amazing!
Thank u Gengillibrand
Please continue to stand strong against this harmful bill!
Where were you on obamacare, when you clown shoes on the hill made it harder for everyone.
KG - Im a fan. but what about Sen Mc Cain's remarks? maybe its Dems and Repubs debated + create a bi-partisan solution.  ACA needs help.
Screw men and children ?
Thank you for all you're doing. On every front.
Doing a great job "raising your voice" to help save Upstate NY, great job you and your party is doing. You are a total fool lady.
Keep fighting
Thank you Kirsten.  I feel women's rights took a plunge back 50 years in 6 months.
I am a woman and you are against me by pushing for govt-paid killing of our children - SHAME ON YOU!  Wake up and see your harm!
you mean make it harder to kill those with no voice
Which Obama care plan do u subscribe to?
Didn't you exempt yourself?
           
Excellent. Please also promise to run for president in 2020.
If it's such a great bill, why are you exempted? You have no clue how your party screwed the American people with the ACA! Get a clue!
Keep it UP Kirsten! 
I am so thankful you are my Senator!!
I'm one of your NY constituents. Tim Ryan has the better ideas of what Dems can run on in 2018. You are way out in left field. Not my vote.
Take  one fight at a time
You are such a formidable voice. A better deal. Really? U have no idea what people outside of big cities really want. You are out of touch.
U and schumer are failing ny.
Thank you!
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I cannot count on my senators to do this for me.
Raising your voice doesn't work w Republicans. They don't give a shit about women.
Thank you.
The insurance Lobby is destroying Healthcare in this country we need a single-payer plan get this on the table for discussion
Thank you Senator
Thank you! All female Senators need to work together to protect the healthcare of mothers, kids, seniors. #LadiesLeadBipartisanship
You have nothing to do with healthcare. It's health insurance. And abortion is not healthcare it's elective just like a facelift.
Raise your voice about the illegal immigrant arrested in your state for raping a child
You would think that this bill being against women's Healthcare would be one of #1 reasons to say NO. No one I know was hatched from an egg.
dem shoved this down every bodies throat 7 years ago
not for killing babies
Please keep up the fight. Apparently low blows are allowed these days so, whatever it takes.
One would hope that you will also speak out against a policy that denies able Americans from serving in the military based on prejudice
What about that Israel anti BDS assault on the 1st Amendment you cosponsored? I CAN'T HEAR YOUR VOICE NOW.
Thank you!
Good Lawd you are pathetic.
I hope you're not willing to take crumbs! Women accessing good healthcare shouldn't negate all others getting same. We want what you've got!
Do not stop, keep fighting the GOP. My Health Insurance is at stake.
Thank you!!!

Thank you @SenGillibrand for representing us with your intelligent,reasoned, & compassionate voice
You mean abortions.
Women everywhere thank you!
Get all the Alpha females together bi-partisan and make it happen. Your caucus would send a message to
Thank you, Senator! Keep fighting for the American people! We don't want to die!
atta girl!
Thank you :).
Thank you
Do more than raise voice. Amendments! Vote-o-rama! Delay!
Thank you Senator!
Thank you, senator!! We stand with you. #SaveTheACA #SaveACA
How about any bill that makes it harder for ANYONE to access healthcare?  Those with pre-existing conditions?  The poor?  THATS the fight!
Nothing proposed makes it harder for woman to access healthcare. Free birth control & abortions isn't healthcare. Disingenuous hypocrite
You raise your voice Tina. Our should we say raise your fucking voice. What the matter the vulgarity not working for you any more?
thank you! <3
These New Yorkers thank you! Keep up your fight and know that we are behind you!
Thank you from these New Yorkers!
Thankful that you're my Senator! Keep up the good fight for NY and all Americans!
Thank YOU, @SenSusanCollins & @lisamurkowski leave it to women (excluded from process) to stand-up for humanity. WONDER WOMEN!
Thank you!
Does DC feel like you're working in the twilight zone right now? Thanks for fighting!
Thank you. We are depending on you! Keep fighting, and I'll keep calling.
We sure hope so.  Tks
Please help stop the GOP myth that Dems did not allow debate on #ACA in 2009/10. It is a dirty lie. @SenateMajLdr
Thank you!
@SenGillibrand but we are lucky ones.  So many other states :( I'm just in shock still
We know it Kirsten.  But what can we do? I didn't have to write or call you and @SenSchumer because you have our backs
Thank you @SenGillibrand What else can New Yorkers do to help?
You do that.
Thank you! Please keep up the good work.
Thank you Senator Gillibrand! We are stronger together!
Need to get more GOP Senators on board with this. Talk is cheap; we need their votes.
Hi Kirsten, how are you today
@SenGillibrand why do Dem politician try and cloak the killing of babies by calling it women's health care needs? Sick!
Thank you!
But will raising your voice against a sea of misogynistic Neanderthals make any difference? Can you be heard over the ignorance?
What will you do to stop it?
Will you withhold unanimous consent?
Glad to know you only care about half of your constituents
Thank you for your hard work in this. I am a New Yorker and you will always have my vote.
Thank you so much for all you do. I'm praying you can save Medicaid for so many elderly, disabled & handicapped that rely on it in NY.
The women in the Senate are showing the "stuff" to stand up for right of all Americans to access affordable healthcare.
Appreciate.
With high deductibles and premiums, Obamacare makes it tough for all.   Replace or Fix.   Do something.
Raise your voice?? Dems need to start breaking sh**.  Ahem, just sayin'
http://www.thedailybeast.com/before-trumpcare-a-free-clinic-saved-mitch-mcconnells-life â€¦ - RT Mitch on his free healthcare!
Then start screaming at Obamacare! Just don't drop the F-BOMB.......Please, the children might hear!
I do believe you're up for reelection in November and you voted "NO" on healthcare. Sen. Gillibrand doesn't want to do her job vote her out.
How can I get an important healthcare document to you? I have now mailed and attempted to fax to 4 female senators to no avail.
Registered letter w signature required?
Registered but was informed could not do signature required...unless I was misinformed.
Hmm. Check USPS site? Very frustrating  we can't easily get mail to our reps though.
All tracking numbers say delivered. I wont stop! I'll show up in person if I have to! Just don't want it to fall into the wrong hands!
Do it! Called my rep for appointment and it is 2 months out. Ugh! Good luck and thanks for your tenacity.

Absolute nonsense. Stop using women as a battering ram. Stop the demagoguery. Be specific without lies. We women are not stupid.
Keep fighting for us
Keep fighting @SenGillibrand !
Thank you!
Thank you for taking care of your constituents!
Don't stop!
I'm also a New Yorker and all I can say is "you better or you ain't gettin' my vote!". But thanks for your support.
As my Senator, I trust and know that you will! Thank you for your consistent, strong stand.
Does that include the little girls God has created in their mother's womb that are slaughtered by abortion?
Tina was pro-life and pro-gun when she ran for congress in upstate NY.  Then she was pro-choice anti-gun when running statewide.  HYPOCRITE!
I'm one of your NY constituents counting on you to do just that, and thanking you for your work on our behalf. Go get 'em!
You should start working with the President and not against him. You are not for anyone if you don't support him and his agenda.
Thank you @SenGillibrand
THANK YOU Sen Gillibrand ! In tears of gratitude. This is about OUR LIVES-do not prioritize tax breaks for wealthy on our lives @SenateGOP
My health care costs have tripled over the last few years - go ahead, help
Please know that we are calling,faxing,mailing and tweeting against McConnell's deathcare bill we won't give up either
What if the bill helps the majority of women and is better for the country's debt? Don't you care about men and children?
TY for all you are doing!!!!
Washington DC is all talk no action
Thank you. And thank you for your tireless support of survivors of sexual assault and abuse.
Start Screaming, candidate! #DumpTrump
I can promise you that I'll raise my voice against any bill that makes it harder for women to access the health care they need.
How many amendments you got, Senator. At least 100 I hope?
What about men?
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
