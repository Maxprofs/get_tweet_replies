.@realDonaldTrump said he cares about #womenshealth, but just signed a bill allowing states to withhold #titlex family planning funds. 
I am for planned parenthood but if you want an abortion then you should pay for it not us taxpayers..
Uh go read the HYDE AMENDMENT so the lie can stop NO @PPact FUNDS received from the government can fund abortions What is wrong with ppl
Oh please that's a lie What we don't want is taxpayer money paying for abortions get the money frm someone else
PP will go on w/o Govt $, IRS reveals they made $100 M profit from private donations last year.  Many other clinics provide real HC to women
& now Stephen Miller is in charge of women's issues? Please get these people out of the WH asap. #TrumpTaxReturns #TrumpRussiaInvestigation
Get rid of planned Parenthood. No tax $ for abortions! No more baby parts for profit!
Trump is a thief, masquerading as Pres. If not removed by impeachment, diminished in 2018; removed in 2020. We'll reverse the damage to US!
  As if!!
Duuuude...  yeah you, KG... You are so wrong and so sad.   Why do you lie so much?
Abortion is not healthcare. True healthcare PP farms out to legitimate clinics, they don't do it themselves.
@PPIAction @realDonaldTrump Stop the dramatics. Women have PLENTY of access to healthcare! I'm 48, survived w/o PP just fine!
@masculin15 Were either of you ever an unemployed or couldn't afford COBRA after a biz closed?
Simply because it's not the governments responsibility to do family planning. Unless however you're a Democrat and you can't figure that out
its not just family planning--its access to health care
And how is it the govt responsibility that you have access to healthcare?
Maj of Americans support fed funded healthcare. I'm one of them. Const says govt shld promote gen'l welfare to the public
You are excused but you obviously do not understnad the Constitution or what the heck you are speaking about.
less women less problems? Is that the thought? Beats me. #hemanwomanhatersclub
This President is the worse.
U mean abortion programs--abortion is not birth control
Maybe it's because they were selling baby parts. Talk about shameful!
Glad to see that Ivanka is having so much influence.  None of them have a clue or give a damn about women's health  #voteThemOut
It's pretty clear by now that women's health is this admin's last priority
Oh no it's a priority  - they are actively pursuing ways to undermine women's health
Thank you for your service, Kirsten.
Not!
Shameful
MORE REASON TO BE SAD TONIGHT...  SHAMEFUL...
The fact that even one woman voted for him makes me sick
Donald Trump: "I'm Going to Be Really Good for Women."
and drops #MOAB same day-- what have we become?
Ignorance on the extreme. US citizens do not allow your opposition to Trump and gang become diluted by his war mongering.Distraction tactics
DJT is having a revenge binge on America, it's citizens, & the world. This persons needs 2 be impeached immediately!
For the trumped up reason that they're stopping abortion. They're not. Abortion rates will increase in states that defund @PPact
So you are against abortion? You make an increase of them sound like a bad thing. Or saying women will have better access?
And drop a bomb and then go spend more taxpayer money to go to Mar A Lago.
And Drumph's agenda is only gonna get worse as we approach #Resistance Day elections and the @GOP kisses their seats (and asses) goodbye. 
@IvankaTrump must have to pick and choose what she whispers into Daddy's ear.
Wait. This says nothing about us not being able to seek a Doctor or medical help. How are we limited from it just because of PP??
@PPIAction @realDonaldTrump we should be making sure that everyone has affordable access to healthcare, especially women.
Good to hear!  Now maybe the baby who will grow up to actually represent all New Yorkers will have a chance.
Shameful. That's your response? You're a freaking US Senator lady, DO BETTER!
Did it in a relative secret way and then bombed Afganistan. Effective, nasty, low way to avoid attention that effects all American citizens.
be he never paid attention to a Government SHUT DOWN~! new fun for him? You Think?~! oh boy....
i love how he threatens to cut OFF the POOr~! as a bargain chip on health care ! Dirty= doesn't understand the POOR or Women.
And waste money on bombs we could use for health care or feeding hungry kids!!
@Marv_Vien @PPIAction @realDonaldTrump looks like he's gonna try to pulverize us all instead so we need nothing.
Make no mistake... Trump views women as 2nd class citizens whose crotches he can grab "because he can."
We need you & @NYGovCuomo to intervene at state level to protect our reproductive rights. IDC must stop colluding w Trump GOP. #noIDCNY
Why the hell are old men making these decisions for women?
He just continues to lie. He announced April as SEXUAL HARASSMENT AWARENESS MONTH and then he praises O'Reilly.  Full of shit as usual
@PPIAction @realDonaldTrump   Trump is a big liar!
Glad you are our Sen @SenGillibrand ! Trump does not get it.@MikePenceVP should remember what happened when HE defunded PP-an AIDS epidemic!
Exactly how Sen. Gillibrand?  I don't think it's as you state.
Thank you for your stance on women's health care. Another BIG issue is this President's lack of consulting Congress about military actions.
No public funding of abortions.
Thank you for calling out @realDonaldTrump for his war on women. It's appalling 
Why should taxpayers pay for it?  If you want an abortion, out of pocket, plain and simple.
Misogyny is a central pillar of his agenda, worldview & appeal to dumbasses.
Agreed! Let's be sure we only have to put up with these "people" for a limited time! Sent you a campaign contribution already!
No, he just took funding away from murderers. Woman have other choices for health care, that will actually help them.
And once again glad I live in New York.
@RealDonaldTrump Shame On You Stopping Any Woman's Health Care! We Are All HUMANS!
Donny continues to show how small and short sighted he is. Women's health impacts the entire family, by extension the country
It's infuriating
The Conservatives are thrilled with him. Maybe some of the things he promised in xchange for repeal and replacing OCare?
@IvankaTrump @IvankaTrumpHQ @realDonaldTrump 
Hey Ivanka, where r u when women need ur voice?
Shame on u and ur clueless Father.
Thanks 4 all your help, Ivanka. Tsk.
Killing children conceived thru irresponsible sexual behavior isn't heath care. Convince your state it is if you want to kill your offspring
Shameful doesn't even begin to cover it! #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
He is hateful, spiteful, small-minded and without a single moral thread in his expensive suits.
Change your message senator
not the taxpayers responsibilities. Let them by Obamacare, you think it's so great.
#SenateInvestigationDithersWhileDemocracyBurns.#WomensAccess2Healthcare only 1 of #manyOutrageousDestructiveActs #EntireAdminstrationHas2Go
Shameful...
Interesting how he signed this today when he knows media will only cover the bombing.
Nobody has more respect for women than the Donald 
It IS shameful, thank you Senator.
Where is @IvankaTrump now?
Maybe @IvankaTrump told daddy she was upset???
.@realdonaldtrump said: "I love women. I have great respect for women. No one has greater respect for women than me".  Trump = LIAR

When own people of Japan and the United States are detained  by the North Korea, North Korea will gain advantageous on negotiation at first.
it's specifically to shore up ratings with his base 
#standwithpp
At the rate he flip-flops, maybe he'll change his mind tomorrow.
More than 60% non-college educated white women voted for this. That's our problem right there. Start the conversations now. 2018 is coming.
No woman is unable to access health care in the US. The President decided to let each state decide for themselves whether or not to fund PP.
Liz, do you live on another planet?
Shameful and sickening. This from the person who "cherishes" women (ick) But not their lives, their health, or the lives of their families.
You know @realDonaldTrump only "cherishes" what he can grab!?!
Trump only has one use for women. That's why we decided to make him dance.
The president must be removed from office. Why is the GOP getting away with this lie that tax dollars fund abortion? Make them suffer.
And where is Ivanka to speak out on this?
