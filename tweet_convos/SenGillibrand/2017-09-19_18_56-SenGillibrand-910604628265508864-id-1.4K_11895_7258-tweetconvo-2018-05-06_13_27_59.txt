Don't we need pregnant women?
College educated married females(Voted for Trump) have their spouse's insurance. This hurts single and minority women.
Don't be so trusting. This bill allows waivers for insurers to raise prices skyhigh for people who are already insured if they get ill. Read
A *little* higher rate wld be fine. But many have their rates deliberately raisd to where they can't afford. A national pool keeps rates low
Explanation by my insurance agent 4 why my premium was so high. It's also basic common sense that larger pool distributes risk more broadly
The bill also has some extremely deceptive language that allows insurers to raise rates on already-insured families if someone gets sick

I can understand people not liking ACA. I can understand people wanting something better. I cannot understand anyone who supports this.
People who benefit from the GOP healthcare bill: insurance companies who dont have to pay for as much and the people whose pockets they line
The way the bill is written, insurance companies would not longer have to cover somethings. Like pregnancy. So they would benefit.
Great job @realDonaldTrump    #DEPLORABLES,  I hope none of you become pregnant or are currently ill. BTW 2 more coal mines are closing
So basically it ditches the people who need the health care.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @GOP are sacks of America we must, must vote this Party out of office #GOP willing 2Kill 30 million Americans
these men all look like poorly executed caricatures.
Concessions need to be made....would be nice for others instead of individual payers for a change
"No more medical care for pregnant women"---From the Pro-Life Party...
It's about time!!! Hey wait a sec...do what? U jokin?

Stop the FAKENEWS. The bill does not stop states from making preexisting conditions mandatory once they get their block grant. #shameonAP
I thought the previous round was the last ditch? This is exhausting.
Good idea: cut insurance for the sick, mentally ill, drug addicted, and pregnant.  #VoteNo
They're going to need new jobs if they pass this.
That would be true in a democracy where your elected representatives actually represented your best interests.
All the bill does is remove all the mandates of Obamacare and shift control of health care plans from the federal govt to states #shameonAP
I guess the YEAs will live with it. They'll be shunned at home, a really inhumane act, but how can anyone associate with inhumane guys?

What a shitshow, not fair
Evert successive plan they say is better than the last,  must grade by number losing health care
I think listing the losers may take years.
These MotherFU%kers Should have to USE THE SAME Healthcare SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT...
Catastrophic works fine, and nobody disses pregnant women either. Get a grip.  Obamacare sucks really bad,  it's gotta go.
Not a single woman in that picture let alone a pregnant one. Please let women make laws affecting male health.
How could we be looking at this awful bill again?
I have made phone calls to my own Senators as well as swing R Senators...hoping it makes a difference.
Every week it's like this. We have to beg our own government every week not to kill us. What kind of life is this? Why, America?

Call your Senators
The republicans would kick the crutches out from underneath tiny tim to get a 'victory ' right now.
@LindseyGrahamSC You may have a comic side to you that people enjoy; this is definitely not funny, in any way!
I'm curious if the families of Senate/House members will be forced to be on this plan?
Oh, no!  They have a great plan that we pay for. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP. I think they should be forced to use it.
Fuck those crap mongers! We need to help vote out the Repubes in 18!
Independent analysts say the latest Senate Republican bill is likely to leave more people uninsured than the Affordable Care Act. GOP hate u
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Why are they doing this?
Look at these white men ruining lives. Embarrassing.  Deeply wrong.
I am a college educated white woman who carries the insurance for my family. My premiums, deductibles and copays are unmanageable now!
No to birth control, and triple-no to taking care of your baby.  Yeah, boy, those family values of  the party of @realDonaldTrump
@LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @DeanHeller @SenateMajLdr 

WILL KILL CHILDREN FOR $400 MILLION IN KOCH CASH 

#VoteThemOut #TheResistance
When will they learn pregnant women is what keeps this world turning. Shame on @GOP

Yes, because NY and CA Senators know how to take care of folks in WY an ND.
So then the people who need it the most lose out??? What has happened to our humanity?
These old white men seem OK with that.
Shame on all of you. Cruel and partisan.
Cassidy always seems to be laughing about this...
Discouraged that the GOP don't see how important health care services are to people planning to screw the public again
Just look at those smug, old white men who can't explain the concept of insurance looking pleased with themselves.
The "pro-life" party seeks to cut off health care for pregnant women.
People with pre-existing conditions, pregnant women among those who lose out in GOP's latest health care bill. http://apne.ws/iP7et7Z 
let's not forget kids on Medicaid, special needs kids and Chips kids. Pro life indeed #deplorable
Noone  in Canada has ever been denied healthcare because of pre-existing conditions.   It is discrimination.  Utterly disgusting.
Well said, and kudos to #Canada @DrTedros @WHO
Care to comment? @LindseyGrahamSC @BillCassidy @GOP
No one loses the plan they purchase with their own money.
What does this even mean?
It means one only has the right to the medical coverage one pays for with money they've earned themselves.
So you’re against insurance as a concept?
Not at all. I'm against AP misleading its readers about the impact of changes to a welfare plan.
Ah yes, of course. How principled.
An unprincipled man is as trustworthy as a thief.
It - as I understand it - will ELIMINATE Medicaid by 2016 - many of our veterans depend on this.
Can't eliminate something in the past. I think u mean 2026
