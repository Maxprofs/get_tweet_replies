Less than 200yrs of actual data do not make trend.  What about our largest producer of energy, the sun?  Barely 30yrs of data on our star.
People ought to rebrand fight against climate change as a fight against POLLUTION.
Large % won't believe the former but do see the latter.
Yeah, let's ban water vapor...the #1 greenhouse gas...way more potent than CO2.
Climate change is not caused by CO2.
Another Propaganda Senator spreading false info... Fear Mongering on climate change
.
Need to start thinking about a solution beyond Trump and the USA govt ....

estas arando en el mar; trumph no tiene esos valores
The sun is 1.3 millions x's bigger than earth the sun drives climate not c02 which plants breath
Climate change in a joke, a made up theory to hide that fact that we have a 10th planet in our solar system causing havoc.
Try some other line your dingbat is showing
Why do you think they care about our safety and security? Look at no water for PR, taunting NK, gutting health care, pollution deregulation.
It would be great if you tweeted about the Constitutional Convention & how Gov. Cuomo is trying to take our pensions!
Really senator.  If this is really so important what are you proposing to actually effect climate change?  Talk a good game but no solutions
I vote in NY.  You should say that energy storage is the problem, until that is solved nuclear needs to be throttled up.
Enormous amts of water vapor are even far more effective in producing more water vapor than paltry amts of CO2. They won't tell you that.
Few deny climate change. It's the man made part that we deny. Water vapor is the no. 1 green house gas. Way beyond CO2.
Admitting climate change is real would contradict their policy agenda, dismantle CPP, bring back coal, which is predicated on Climate Denial
trump too stupid to understand global warming!
Thank you, Senator! Fyi going plant-based is a great way to combat climate change on a personal level 
Al gore is a fraud who spews more carbon on 1 private jet flight than most Americans will put out in a year
The climate changes constantly you're wasting your breath thinking it's man-made
They belong to the flat earth society Kirsten. They will never acknowledge reality.
Being real and being caused by humans are two different things. And then there are the exaggerations of the alarmists about the dangers and ignoring of the benefits.
Senator I wonder if you have heard of Patrick Moore he actually has degrees in environment and climate. Do you respect his opinion?
Yes climate change is real...... Just why is it changing AGAIN. Please don't be so silly as to say man is the cause.
Climate change? What about the donation from Harvey Weinstein?
Potential Democratic 2020 hopefuls took donations from Harvey Weinstein http://thedailypotus.com/potential-democratic-2020-hopefuls-took-donations-from-harvey-weinstein/ …
Apparently politicians don’t understand that the earth functions in cycles:water,rock,life&http://weather.Ice  ages come every 20K years
Keep standing tall! President in 2020
It would serve him well to do a lot of things, but he won't because he's a douchetwat psycho. Don't reason with him, get him out.
Climate change has been happening since the beginning of time. The dinosaurs lost to an ice age. We cannot change the course of the future.
Al gores lie about polar ice being fully melted in 2013 it's only thicker the earth hasent got warmer in over 20 yrs
Now where did u say u got that climate change degree??
Unfortunately talking to a brick wall -- Trump's head. Stronger persuasion method other than words is needed.
In order to do that Trump has to be convinced there's MONEY in accepting climate change...if he ran a wind power factory, he'd be aboard.
I acknowledge scientific proof that climate change is totally false. The Dems want the 10 trillion that it would cost the US in this deal.
Trump is mentally unfit. Congress please do something to remove him before it is too late.
Ko@m
Climate change is absolutely real. It was sunny and 75 here yd, and now it’s raining! WTF! Do us all a favor Kirsten and resign!

This "president" just wants to erase everything PRESIDENT OBAMA accomplished. He is a jealous moron.
of course the climate has been changing for millions of years the present Interglacial is over thousand years
What makes you think Trump cares about humans other than his own family?
Novel idea/ Trump Admin embracing anything rational. Unfortunately, our POTUS starts twitter wars with celebrities- @eminem on deck.
Box his ears...the polar ice cap is melting

Prove it!
Keepin' up with CHINA.
That is one of many things that would serve them well #toomany #somany #toomuchtocount #heavenhelpus
SCAM ALERT
It would Serve you to seek help for your Progressive Retardation! Chicken Little/Climate Change=Fairy Tales!!!
wow. You need to gather your facts.
Reality is that you are responsible for cutting our thoughts whit Phillip Morris. You are a corrupt individual and cannot be trusted.
#CPV #Minisinkcompressor #VLP spew ghg methane formaldehyde radon benzene making our kids sick! Speak out & help us #save our water #stopcpv
Right! In NYS @NYGovCuomo is promoting toxic corrupt #CPV in Orange County. Speak out against fracked gas processing in NYs. Making us sick!
Senator, have you not been paying attention?  Trump would sooner light himself on fire than do the right thing for this country.
His words mean nothing. Focus on getting something some. Small real victories are more important than his meaningless words.
madam   blonde  senator y  do not  know what climate  change it is  there is  no climate  change that is you are not familiar  with science
I’m more concerned about Yellowstone blowing up or for any other hotspots around the world. Throw that EPA crap right out the window
Climate change so real that we have records of the same kind of weather conditions in the 1800s
"It would serve the Trump Administration well" is simply not strong enough. Why don't you pass a law for presidents to show tax returns?
Kirsten is Keynote Speaker at Brooklyn Conference. Backed and funded by Soros and friends, including Linda Sarsour. Anti-American Senator.
When his golf courses suffer he will react
Agreed and not going to as long as he is being paid not to acknowledge it. #onlymoneymattersto45
As a student it sickens me that my classmates deny it... in science class and say that it is all a myth
Why r u not a friend to Israel?
Yep the climate changed today from sunshine to rain & the temp was 8 degrees cooler so we can agree on climate change
Yes but.. does that serve the Russian mobsters that own & (are blackmailing) the Trumps ? That's the real question here.
Zzzzzz
Nope !! Climate change is a farce
Trumps IQ is so low, he can't comprehend the term "GLOBAL WARMING". If him & his klan can't make $$$ off of it, it don't matter or exist
And you're smoking too much dope and listen to too much bullshit
This country is and has made considerable progress in improving our environment. We cannot afford to pay others to do their own job.
Good luck with that.
Would piss of Koch so not happening. All of the rollbacks are payoffs to them and they keep house in line from impeachment @realDonaldTrump
Yes, you're absolutely right! & to that end, we must leave fossil fuels in the ground & ban #fracking everywhere. #Methane=#Climate killer.
@realDonaldTrump knows he's so ancient he'll be dead long before the rising waters consume Mar-a-lago, so it is totally irrelevant to him.
What?!
Senator you are talking like this administration is rational. They aren't. These aren't normal people. They don't care.
Question what time period would you like rather live in, PETM or an Ice age?
Real down to earth ppl know what climate change is and what it's not. It's a scheme to fund socialism, as way to destroy America. Screw that
Senator, he has so much on his plate right now NK,Fires, Hurricanes, climate change is furthest thing on his mind. He needs genuine help
It won’t happen. #Impeach45
So true that no one has provided indisputable proof. I know, just like Obama, this is more of a security issue than fighting terrorism. Hum
Don’t hold your breath.
Spoken like a true phony POS...suckled at the teet of sexual degenerate Weinstein for years...now when exposed the feigned outrage comes out
If they could see the world beyond their own narrow viewpoint, but that's only in a fantasy world could they change. #sos
October has been the warmest September. I would normally be calling my landlord for heat, but instead I'm using the AC.
the US has lowered carbon emissions more than anywhere in the world its not a govt program
If it's real,  why do you need to continously alter or fabricate data to support this drivel? Real doesn't need fake information.
it would the trump administration to break his fingers and duct tape his mouth.

He diligently observed:
For whatever unites nature, though imperfectly, paves the way to the discovery of pollutants as Harvey Weinstein?
As long as it dont cost united states jobs and business to move out of us due to unbalanced deals.
Yes the Climate does change, it has for Millions of years. Its called NATURE
No one disputes climate change is real. When I was in High school in the 80's, the fear mongering was the coming ice age. Let it go, Gilli.
But they don't care about safety & security, they only care about themselves.
Libtards and the liberal narrative pushed by leftist professors on college campuses
No it's not. You can pretend all day but the real data shows otherwise.
At 74, considering dropping out. Could have done at 21, but went to Viet  Nam. Our country has been hijacked by bar stool creeps. Adios!
silence your lips. you're irrelevant
Sadly.    Not gonna happen
He'll never do what's right. In all cases he'll ask himself 'what would Obama do' and then do the opposite.
Harvey Weinstein is Hollywood and Politicians GOD........                       SILENCE FOR DECADES
It would serve Kirsten Gillibrand well to RETURN the thousands of $$$dollars that sexual predator/sexual abuser #HarveyWeinstein gave to her
it may be real but changing the world climate to be what you want it to be is simply ridiculous and unscientific. THINK about it
U mean it would serve U well ......dont u ??
Get rid of psychopaths & morons..!
Safety and Security??? How so? Or, Peddling fear again?
It would serve the American people to know  that the former democrat party is Now the George Soros NaziCrat Potty. Fascist/Communist,  same.
We(both parties) need to do profoundly more than just acknowledge effects of climate change but, that would be good too!
They don't care and they don't understand.
NY is in a neck and neck race with CA to see who has the biggest idiot politicians
You go ahead and believe a president can do anything about climate change @SenGillbrand , there is a higher agenda
Must be since none of these politicians ever acknowledge #GeoEngineering or anything else they do that makes it worse.
All should read Navy reports on how rising sea levels are threatening Navsta Norfolk and our Naval Spec Warfare locations in Virginia Beach.
Hysterical! C'mon man the sea hasn't risen enough to measure. Erosion changed that data.
No, it doesn't.
Man causd climat ch isn't real & no mattr how many times u repeat th lie wil make it true. Climate ch is natural causd by Sun & ocean cycles
Keep drinking that kool-aid.
And you keep believing bs lies.
What do you think about #GeoEngineering does or doesn't effect our weather?
Proof ? Or factless theories ?
Do you really believe that you can control God's earth with your political rhetoric. One good volcanic eruption will start a deep freeze.
Kill off all vegetation, and create a new "dark age".
Go preach you "Climate Change" to China and stand in Tiananmen Square demanding they live under the same EPA regulations Congress has on us.
Just heard today on the weather channel that this winter is expected to be colder than the last 10 years..... hmmmm interesting
YOU CAN'T CHANGE MOTHER NATURE GET TO WORK ON TAXES DO YOUR JOB
Our security? The southern border far more important to our security
We can't even get 45 to recognize the Wildlifes burning in the West or that the Hurricane Recoveries are not yet Recovered. He's useless !
He actually gave federal funds today
Like climate change is going to stop isis from attacking the US
#Trump's Far Right base would never okay admitting climate change
Maybe the fact that we're spending $$ on so much Climate driven destruction...never mind
If you educated yourself this has happened long before the industrial age. I know that doesn't fit your rant but real facts don't.
Alright. You stop driving, flyin Around on private jets, using plastic, having air conditioning, heating your house, and ALL that causes the climate to "change"... Im on board. You first.
yes Senator. He's right on the verge of doing that. I'm outraged at this fantasy statement like Diane Feinstein's stmnt that he'll change.
They know it's real they're just stalling so fossil fuel can collect their money and they don't care how much the world burns in mean time.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Why does it take fabricated data to support your claims if this is real? Caught 9x in 12 years.
That's not likely to happen with this administration. We need #RegimeChange in the USA... right now.
Treason
Damn right they're committing treason. When you take actions against the preservation of this nation, you're a traitor.
#weinsteinswomen
SENATOR ALL IS NOT LOSS! HAVE FAITH IN GOD! IT IS GOD WHO TRULLY CONTROLS EVERYTHING !EVEN CLIMATE!
Yes! Thank you @SenGillibrand!
SENATOR EVEN IF THIS ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGE IT! IT WILL TAKE EFFORTS OF MANY NATION !AND MANY DECADES ;TO CURB CLIMATE CHANGE!
That would be fine advice, if safety and security mattered to him.
Screw that... Tweeting about Jamelle Hill and the ESPN ratings are way more important!! 
Lol. 
or his entire party

Lying #FemiNazi gonna lie.
I worry for my grandchildren
