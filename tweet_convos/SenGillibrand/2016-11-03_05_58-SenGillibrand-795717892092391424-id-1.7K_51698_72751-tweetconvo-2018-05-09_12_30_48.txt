Just don't vote for Clinton.
There's no one else to vote4 but theBest QUALIFIED @HillaryClinton so y suggest theBest candidate not get theJob
Oops, I know: That's what U call #Heritage

TheKind that NEVER competed on a level playing field
Tell us Hillary: How does it feel 2b #BlackByExperience knowing u'r theBest QUALIFIED but rejectd
Indeed, suddenly, you're expectd to account for everyone else's faults bc your own r insufficient
HRC is a dangerous -unqualified- sociopath -- and frail little old lady.
Oh STOP it: You kno you'r projectn "a dangerous -unqualified- sociopath" @realDonaldTrump on2 her
Clinton violated the Espionage Act. Trump didn't.
And Mr. Lewis- you went through ALL of that just to end-up kissing-up to the Clintons. @BernieSanders was it.
You have a lot of gall trying to tell Rep. Lewis who he should support. You should be more respectful, Rep. Lewis is a hero.
Alias-So Freedom of Speech is "Gall" to you? Is that what Lewis fought for? FYI Clintons are no friend to Blacks @repjohnlewis
never said you didn't have the right, but yes, it's gall. The man can make his own choices. You're assuming he's ignorant.
No Alias- U R confused. Who suggested he is ignorant? Who said he can not make his own choices? You're all over the place here
You did. You literally told him he was wrong to support Hillary as if he's not smart enough to make his own educated choice.
Aliias- You are starting to bore me and you are making things up. No time for this nonsense. Have a good day. VOTE!
Seems to me the only cesspools are trailer parks and the green mountains.
Just Detroit?
@ValaAfshar
@seabethree right on schedule
Idiot
John does not look healthy at all in this photo! Had he been gassed?

 Thanks for sticking up for all of us, Congressman. And for trying to make civilization become civilized.
vote blue down the ballot vote honor the sacrifice of the people that died for our freedom VOTE 
You do know that Democrats were in conto of the southern states that stopped AA from voting.  They now want your votes in return for food

@HillaryClinton let's make a difference.
You are an inspiration to us all!
God bless you and thank you for being the man you are.
thank you, Sir!

@sahilkapur The Party they still vote 4 today did that. Democrats
Hipocrit tell people to vote and then when the person they voted don't win it's not fair to them. Mr. Lewis you're a sad man.
I will sir. I will. You are an inspiration to us all.  Walking the walk, not just talking the talk.
@DeShaunFrye 
I know many outside US wonder why we have to "get out the vote" and who never take their right to vote for granted.
Thank you for your service!!
Sure, @repjohnlewis. "Vote."...
For the party that cheated #Bernie, subverted democracy & yields to the Queen of Corruption. @HillaryClinton
If you really cared about @SenSanders vision, as I do, you would not be trying to help Mr. Trump win.
I'm not. I also don't subscribe to Establishment duopoly in political theater. @DavidSamuelAuer @repjohnlewis @HillaryClinton @SenSanders
I would love there to be alternatives also. Prioritized voting would be great. That is not the moment in time we are currently in, alas.
#DemExit happened for so many reasons. REAL Progressives will not stand for it. @DavidSamuelAuer @repjohnlewis @HillaryClinton @SenSanders
.@DrJillStein carries the Progressive platform forward.
I vote @GreenPartyUS for principle & major party status.
#DemExit
@DavidSamuelAuer
Millions of Progressives who left Dems will no longer be herded into supporting BS, the illusion of choice & GOP-lite. @DavidSamuelAuer
I hear you. Keep pushing what you believe. @BS_Whistler I respect your choice even if I do not agree.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis, for all you've done for our country. Much love and appreciation. Our family delivered our ballots today!
Thank  you for all you endured.
Rep John Lewis, thank you!  I also don't take my right to vote lightly. 
ONLY BECAUSE YOU WERE ACTING A DAMNED FOOL. IF YOU HAD COMPLIED, THIS PHOTO WOULDN'T EXIST. YOU FABRICATED YOUR OWN HATE. THUG
what have you done for me lately?
@Writer_DG Mr Lewis, you're a hero, my generation bears witness to your courage. Your legacy must cont. Trump will destroy it.
notre droit de vote en FRANCE est libre et indépendant ,alors allez voter a la #PrimairesGauche c'est votre responsabilité
@DWStweets absolutely! And it's a shame some1 like Debbie made hard earned votes void by fixing an election 4 @HillaryClinton
I voted for the party which woouldn't take those rights away from you again. #ImWithHer #Clinton2016 #VotingRightsAct
@HouseDemocrats I wish you didn't have to go thru all that THANK YOU
thank you
@NickCannon You need to read this by John Lewis, than tell me you won't VOTE!
what media outlet told you the lie that I wasn't voting?
I'm guessing they got their info from the most trusted source in news-casting, CNN
Actually it came straight from the horses mouth. Check my feed. I provided proof. Go check. You can always Google.

You cant be trusted, at least 5 foreign govts can easily blackmail you!
I agree with you on this, Mr. Lewis.
@bulldoghill When were you beaten for the right to vote??
Congratulations John you took 1 beating 50 yrs ago and made a career out of it. You are a Charlatan
And Act Like A Child!
Yet you helped Hillary defeat a man who handcuffed himself to colored folk around the time you were fighting. #ShouldaBeenBernie
I would have preferred @SenSanders too. Ask yourself whether you want Mr. Trump or Sec. Clinton to be our next president.
I want 4 years of a disaster, and 8 years of a Berniecrat to lead the new era in politics. We can't fix a corrupt system by playing along.
That seems unlikely and strategically unsound. I like your optimism regardless. @DoctorFluxx @repjohnlewis @WinterRaptor @SenSanders
Keep walking with the wind! #JohnLewisIsMyHero #servantleadership 
Nice Laura!
We did vote.  You lost. Accept it and accept your president.  No Russians knocked on anyone's door to vote for Trump.
. .The beating you've been trading on for 50+ years was given to you by Democrats MLK was a Republican and a good man unlike u
.@repjohnlewis You brought us honor and courage. We honor you.
John you did alot 4 right to vote, yet we the people, USA elected Donald Trump, who you call illegitimate! does that make us?
@HillaryClinton
That's RIGHT, not privilege @JohnHMerrill a right you don't believe Every Citizen 18 & over deserves to have automatically.
we agree! Voting is a right! We won't every eligible US citizen that is a resident of Alabama to be registered!
we do not agree. You stated you do not believe that automatic registration is a way to reach this goal.  https://thinkprogress.org/alabama-automatic-registration-b0c4de9b835c#.klthrdj2i …
.@repjohnlewis you gotta get over it old man. I have scars too. You've had 50 years employment while being dumb as a box of rocks.We're even
50 years of service, that is. A nation is grateful to @repjohnlewis. @TyrannoGov, I wish you health and recovery. Take care.
what the hell is wrong with you what is this man done to you
@mphoenixempire I am black and the moment he disrespected Bernie Sanders, I was dissapointed.
now sanders supporters don't know what to do but they need to vote HC going from Bern to DT makes no sense
I am #NeverHillaryOrTrump and I am going to #WriteInBernie.

@lexiplus eh, I'd rather not throw my vote away on someone I don't believe in at all.
so you won't vote at all? Lol
correct. Why would I vote for someone I believe should have no place in office?
would that not also be throwing your vote away?
so why throw my vote and my morals away all in one go? 
there's absolutely no one you agree with? Not even third party?
if I had a gun to my head I would vote Gary Johnson but he's also kind of a slight on the libertarian party. So no.
This is what @realDonaldTrump and his KKK supporters want to get back to. #TrumpsterFire #NeverTrump #TrumpistheWorst
Your past doesn't excuse the fact that you're now a partisan hack.
I will.  I've voted in every election.
@ViewFromWise thank you sir!
God bless you!!
You would think that Rep. Lewis of all people would want the laws executed.
thank u for the sacrifice, it's a shame that our people today have forgotten what it took to get our freedom.
We didnt forget... Parents didn't sit their children down and explain True American History
Congrats on your vote for Russia!
lol yep... Russia bought Clinton.. that's why they want Trump to win ok..:-)
It's tough getting through to the weak minded!! Those rump lovers just don't get it.
: My dad is a Holocaust survivor. Everyone has a cross to bear. We're voting for @realDonaldTrump. @seanhannity
U really have these motives twisted. Why bash Rep. Lewis.
: Because he acts like his trips to the toilet don't stank.
Still like to know why u don't like him.
By the way, who has @realDonaldTrump fought for.
AMEN it is a Damn shame people forgot the struggle black folks had to endure. Even Black folks forgot.
Hillary inspirara a mujeres y ninas de todo el mando a votar porella. ( inspired for women and girls through out the World.)

Brother thank you for your sacrifice and courage at that time nothing change really lets unite with Farrakhan now

For who? I don't care for either candidate.
You better feel damn lucky that black people vote for you simply because of your skin color.
While you were doing that, she was a GOLDWATER GIRL who VOTED AGAINST EVERYTHING you were trying to do. AnotherDEM sold out.
so did Bernie Sanders but U lied & told every1 he wasn't there! enjoy your silver, we R not voting for hillary #JillNotHill
We love you for all your sacrifices & drive to keep Dems @POTUS & back to the Senate! #StrongerTogether #ForwardTogether
And is was Leftists Dems that were the ones doing the beatings. Dems pushed, passed and enforced Jim Crow Laws. Fact!
Much respect for a true American here, John Lewis!
Voting is a RIGHT for CITIZENS. A VOTER "ID" would PROTECT those RIGHTS! But u sorry ass LIBS protect yourselves!
@stephanpastis 

Thank you for all your sacrifice. I'll think of you when I am voting for Trump.
Thank you for your courage.
you, sir, are a true American hero. 
@M3aloney Hope you voted for Trump and not that low energy criminal who left Americans to die.
Thank you. For everything. We're all better people because of your leadership and influence.
Yesssssss!!! For some of us we do not have a choice even when there isn't a real choice in Candidates..... always vote
John Lewis just led a march to vote in my county on the 1st. I didn't find out about it until the next morning. So bummed.
I know how you feel. I am trying to be more connected so i can get wind of these things on time!
I think they kept this one quiet on purpose since it was mainly for Bethune Cookman students, and this is the land of Trump.
I see!
@DWStweets Duped by democrats!
Thanks for your bravery :)

you forgot spit on when Obamacare signed. Or did you retract that claim?
Thank you!
we didmaking America great again
TRUE AMERICAN HERO! Working families thank you sir! #IAMAW
Thank you for all you have done.
I think I remember you from March 7th, 1965. Remember the little white kid in the suit and trench coat? ;)

Don't let the loss of their lives go in vain. Can't tell u who to vote for, but VOTE FOR HILLARY!  Do as I did....
Guy can't remember if Bernie was there, but he saw Hillary! DEMXIT. All corrupt.
@judydchandler VOTE. DON'T LET ANYONE INTIMATE YOU.
@HillaryClinton I respect all you've done Mr. Lewis, but the fact of the matter, we can't vote for Hillary's corruption
Bless you Rep. Lewis and all others that worked so very hard, were beaten and died for us. I will always honor you and VOTE
@coldplums #inspiration #amen
Thanks to YOU for your sacrifice! It's people like you who make the US great and the world a safer place.
You must not know, it was Republicans that gave you the right to vote with the 15th Amendment. Democrats called us Scalawags.
Thank you for your efforts for all Americans. You are a hero in my eyes!
You'd think someone so serious about the right to vote would support sensible voter ID laws, but no.
And we honor you, sir. Thank you. Vote, people. Don't let anyone use hateful rhetoric to discourage you & deny you your right
not pandering for votes just asking people to exercise the right to vote that countless have died to give us thank you john
Why won't the racist #CongressionalBlackCaucus let white ppl join even if they represent a majority-black district? @repjohnlewis #equality
@WildChild69 You, sir, are an American hero.
yes he is! We need to listen to him and take notice of what he is seeing in DC
and let's remember there was an FBI director back then who Was attacking people like John Lewis #Dumptrump
@KarlFrisch @FoxNews @CNN @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept @HillaryClinton  AMERICA HONORS YOU JOHN LEWIS.#NeverTrump#VoteBlue
@HillaryClinton so you myst be appalled that the DNC hired mentally ill to incite violence at Trump events #ProjectVeritas Vid
But you become corrupt like criminal @HillaryClinton get used to the fact of president @realDonaldTrump
Demand Trump release his taxes immediately! No excuses or delays!
And your party paid goons to disrupt Trump rally and blame him... you sully your legacy with silence
@M3aloney look at some crime statistics all you did was unleash the black beast
Yes, John. Vote for a liar and a cheat who cares no more for you than Bull Connor did! You haven't learned much!
Without you and those who fought with you, America would be a much lesser place. Thank You.
GOD BLESS YOU!
That's right- 
1870- 15th Amendment
Black America's Right To Vote 
Rep in favor- 100% Dem in favor- 0%

@HillaryClinton  thank God for the Republicans who fought so hard against the democrats for your right.
@M3aloney I have a video of yesterday where 4 black guys were besting up a Trump voter. TODAY! Not 60 years ago. Proud now?

Wow x

brave, brave man. I can't watch news from that time. Breaks my heart.  I voted!!#imwithher

Thos has nothing to do with this election.It belongs in history books..
@DWStweets

@HillaryClinton While some try 2suppress our right 2vote, let's show our strength. "No weapon formed against us will prosper."
Except, John...your own Dems rigged the voting, so exactly what is it you ask us to do here ?
@donna_dishman does this election cycle resemble the '60's in terms of racial animus?
How is voting a Right when all the choices are Pre-chosen by Wrong people?
like going to the store and choosing between #GMO yellow corn or GMO white corn...not a Right for whom detests it
Thank you.
@HillaryClinton It's time to assign a special prosecutor for this mess. Let's drain the swamp in Washington DC. Vote Trump.
@AthertonKD How much did Clintons/DNC pay you to smear Sanders?  Now look where we're at!
let's honor this American hero and go out and vote along with a friend or a neighbor!
Sorry, John, but you lost me months ago.
Thank you Mr. Lewis for your past and continuous honorable service to this country.
Powerful.....wings of thought soaring through a positive mind... Just shared with my children.
@jaketapper -of course you did and Donald Trump will do more for urban black voters the HTC who will be same old past !!
I will be voting Today!
Thank you For Your Service To Our Country.
@HillaryClinton Vote for change...Vote Trump!!
They're taking it from us John.
Democracy is dying before our eyes.
I'm sorry.
@jaketapper 
So why are you a Democrat?
thank you Mr Lewis for fighting for my rights
Very best of wishes to you for Nov 8th; many,many of us outside the US are watching this - and are with you
And Void elections when there is election fraud and foreign interference! Ask the Supreme Court Tuesday!
@FLDems
And just like Hillary, you've come through all the adversity a better person. I pray i have such courage.

True. And remember - a man like you got the franchise in the US before women did. Food for thought.
@RealLucyLawless if you don't vote you cannot complain so VOTE
@HillaryClinton Thank you John Lewis!!  This is why I vote EVERY time.  I do not take this for granted.  Grateful heart!
@MonopointAmy Bless you Mr. Lewis.
