Thank you for fighting Senator!
Dept. of Ag. also helps w/rurual housing subsidies. Dept. of Ag. is being cut too.
These sound drastic, but the devil is in the details. Cuts to bloated admin. are good, not program services.
@barbaraJean1980 info on cuts
Good, it's about time the fat is cut.
So basically he's making huge cuts to make any compromise seem mild in comparison. Don't fall for it Dems...
This is great news, @SenGillibrand! Less of you  (govt) in our lives, the better all New Yorkers will be! #PersonalResponsibly @POTUS
Good!  All the things that State and local Government should be funding themselves!
Americans have been under financial attack by an ineffective government, time to tighten governments fiscal belt
nope again.
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN GO PRESIDENT TRUMP
This New York Senior says Amen. And thank you!
This New York state
Exactly who is he Making America Great  Again for?? Congress do your job, please!
Right. The middle class is still bent over from 8 years of socialism. Lets try something different for a while.
For Christ's sake, Stop. Baseline budgeting! Subtract that from proposed cuts and your talking peanuts. What's next? Dogfood for seniors?
Thank you, my Senator. PLEASE find a way to derail this atrocity parade before it runs us over.
yeah and please let all these terrorists in our country too please! Give me a break
Eliminate HUD altogether.  Federal Govt has no business in the housing business!!!
thanks Senator I can see some "trimming " but not for stupid wall + defense increase of billions
what a shame.
Prepare yourself...2020!
We are counting on you and are proud to call you our New York Senator
get rid of duplicating and meals on wheels isn't even a federal program so where r u stuffing the money at?
#FAKENEWS #FAKESENATOR
How about every Politician for the state take a 25% pay cut to help supplement the loss.
$244 Million for Corporate Charters w/ 0 effectiveness measures & don't maintain qualified teachers is RIDICULOUS!
what's your solution? Not to cut anything? Or be a democrat and cut our military again? Don't bitch without solutions.
but it's Americas best budget ever!!!  </sarcasm>
none of that will shortchange me and I'm lower than middle class an none of it will shortchange my grandma stop lying
It's heartless and we shouldn't let billionaires run the country
fight this woth everything you have! We, the people, have no other voice.
please fight against the elimination of the 21st Century Community Learning Center initiative.
@SenSchumer please keep fighting for us - we need you! #nyvoter
Awful budget. Please move it toward supporting every day Americans. Thanks!
Gillibrand 2020!
Reportedly, small airports in many red states depend on Federal funding. Not for long. What do Trump voters think about that?
Hey Gilli, the last eight years of destroying the middle class didn't mean anything to you? Hypocrite.
@NPR good. About time spending was cut
And imperils our health
Please #ImpeachTrump
Please fight this callous, shortsighted, horrible budget blueprint with everything you got.
drop in the bucket, they should be higher!
Fight for us, Senator Gillibrand! You stand between us and this horrifying so-called president. We need to #Impeach45.
I am sure during his campaign all over "real America," he saw...what they need is a bigger military.
Instead of making America great again this makes war & big business great. #VoteThemOut
31% cut to EPA & possibly abolishing it. I cry for future generations. How short sighted the Repubs are #VoteThemOut
Do you have a better plan Senator? Let's see it.
do your job.  Don't pass this budget. He is dismantling our country
@Brasilmagic @POTUS We must stop this malignancy that occupies the WH.
meanwhile:
Melania 
Maralago 
Ivanka  
Kushner  
Trump  
DoD 
@NPR please speak for the poor. the middle class. arts after school and ed progs meals on wheels. the senior center
under Obama State Dept +37.4% & HHS +40%, while there's 100K govt emp who owe over $1B in taxes, let's start there..
America 1st? How is this America 1st? A total dismantling from the inside. We are going backward by decades each day!
we are being terrorized by our own WH. Thank you for fighting for us Kirsten! Don't give up!
There isn't one iota of compassion within this budget. Sadly, I believe this is by design.
Are there estimates on how many jobs would be lost?
don't forget about the environment!
10% reduction is standard corp budget adjustment. Too fat, tighten the belt.
America has nuclear weapons to build.  All Americans must suffer, except the wealthy of course.
Gov't stealing wealth from the private sector on unConstitutional and wasteful Federal offices hurts the economy. @POTUS
The budget has declared war on the middle class, the working poor, students, and the elderly.
Really? Shortchange middle class, seniors & the economy? Exactly what ur team did when they stole Delphi pensions.
Their plan is to make the US so shitty that Kenyan Muslims won’t want to invade us and pass Sharia law.
Thanks for being so concerned about middle-class New Yorkers all of a sudden, Senator.

for now in politics. If you know Trump going to keep talk about Trump been wire tape in Trump tower with there no evidence.
I maybe wrong. It time for Trump to stop talking about Trump been wire tape in Trump tower in Manhattan saying.
Thank you Senator, we know we can count on you to fight for us!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS~!~~~~~~~!!!!!!
