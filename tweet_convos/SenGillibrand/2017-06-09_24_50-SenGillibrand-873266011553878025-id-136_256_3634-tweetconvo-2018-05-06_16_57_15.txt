@jonfavs @PodSaveAmerica Well now that your #RussiaGate plan has shit the bed you have nothing but profanity and bad behavior
no it has not you Righties are so gullible, we are just beginning, lol
Keep telling yourself that. If that's what keeps you from going into depression I'm happy for you.
you will soon be the one going into depression and I will be ecstatic for you and America and the rest of the World!
Well I guess I'll be OK for at least another 42 months.
sadly mistaken there, buddy, don't worry we will  get America back and the world will respect us again, now on with yourself.
That's where you're wrong. When Libs are outclassed they fall back to their worn out phrases & tell opponents to leave. NEVER
bahahahaha
As Theo and Henry's mom, your language sets a poor example. One can be strong without being vulgar and classless
Coarsening does not mean brutish or threatening, insulting, fearsome, uncaring, or Russia. @MtnMD @SoSofieFatale @NBCNightlyNews
Add: crude, vulgar, unpleasant. Coarsening does mean: strengthen, toughen, commit, and empowered.
no I think you have that backwards, the racism belongs to your party, the degenerates belong to your party, the RACIST RIGHT
@jonfavs @PodSaveAmerica Children are watching. Be a leader,be a professional. How does speaking like that help anyone anyway
Yes!! Please! That would b a fantastic show!
About time you come out verbally swinging!  Prez doesn't like political correctness..? No problem. We can tell it like it is. He won't like
yeah its funny when the left acts even remotely as the right does they start their ignorant shit talking!

PLZ follow thru on this.We need your intelligent optimism.Your 'cast with @davidaxelrod in May was great, but eventually depression returns.
I don't think you actually understand the point.
@jonfavs Ha! @PodSaveAmerica was the first thing I thought of. I'd love to hear more from @SenGillibrand
Two people with no talent!
You're perfect for each other!
Yes please! @jonfavs
Do u kiss ur family with that same filthy mouth? Don't buy into the Dems strategy u have to cuss to be liked.
You need to be THROWN OUT OF OFFICE ASAP!!!! My goal will be to kick you so far to the curb>>> YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT YOU!
Mrs Gillibrand. You are the quintessential left wing dilletante. You use a curse word & get called a hero by your low info lemmings.
You get anxiety over Girl Scout cookies? You're a damn Snowflake. My grandmother worked @ Bath Iron Works. You work @ Bath & Body Works.
I can't wait to hear you, you are a great Senator. I am glad you represent us New Yorkers!
Yes!!!
Our culture was forever coarsened on 20 Jan 2017.
F#%@ Yes please!
My candidate for 2020 @SenGillibrand
dont hold back. why we do this. YOUR TIME!
She's also that type of older white women who CACKLES loudly. Yuck
If johnnie mop favreau likes gillibrand, you know shes over; Henry: dont listen to mommies language; she is very sick!
Your going to support her xfter today?
Here for this!
U have diarrhea of the mouth U shouldn't speak publicly about our President in that vial language Bad way to represent our country
NYS s Senator Gillibrand!! She's a force to be reckoned with!!! So glad to call her our Senator!!
Your foul mouth might be appealing in liberal cesspool states like NY, IL and CA, but won't get you anywhere in states that Trump won.
Looking forward to the coarsening of America?  There is something really wrong with you.
Fuck yes
@jonfavs @PodSaveAmerica Please stay in CA we have one no mind Sen you just make it two...f**k yeah! Speaking ur new language
@jonfavs @PodSaveAmerica I hope there will be New York City talk.
ALWAYS in favor of hearing my senator on my favorite political podcast. :)
@jonfavs I'd literally pay to see this. DO IT! PRETTY PLEASE?
@jonfavs NEED to hear K-Gills on #thepod! #myrep #mysenator #friendofthepod
I am proud of you, Senator. You have been fighting the good fight all year. Your voting record speaks for itself. (Take note, @SenSchumer.)
Thank you for standing up for all us concerned Americans living in red districts !! Our congressmen do nothing but ignore our pleas
Oh the pearl clutching indignation you experienced when Trump used foul language... but yet you have the mouth of a truck driver! #hypocrite
Yay!! @TulsiGabbard next???!??
kirsten go on chapo
When they go low ,kick them in the b###s. Nice work today Senator.
Yes please, this must happen!!
F yeah!!  her representing ladies needs  in Congress.
Not as much as I am!!!! 
Go back to NY, you foul-mouthed Senator. The people u represent get 2 weeks' vacation & you're complaining abt working more than 32 weeks
Yes!
Paul Ryan will say he is a newbee and didn't understand perjury and Truth!
This is exciting!

Your interview with Andrew was disturbing. Cursing makes you sound idiotic. I'm rethinking my support. We can be mad but civilized.
This makes me extraordinarily happy.
mom
Repubs started playing Street Rules, its about time Dems stopped playing by Gentlemen's Rules... You go Girl!!  Proud to have voted for her

YES i want this
YAAAAAS
NYC live podcast!!!!
Yay!!
Disgusted that you are supposed to represent me
I'm totally #teamgillibrand!   Way to say it well!
Yeah!  Get her on the pod!
Why testify?  Trump could just play his tapes to prove his argument.
if there are tapes, you can bet your sweet bippy, Trump will not play them, Trump is a Liar!
This better be a NY live show so we can go!!!
Hell yes. The next POTUS. "President Gillibrand" has a fucking great ring to it. Feels really good to say it out loud.
Once again, F--k yeah!!!
Omg YAS! Queen 
Now *this* is a normal New York City conversation.

"Fuck yeah!" -- Friends of the Pod
Keep doing you, Senator!
AHHHH A LIVE SHOW MAYBE? IN NYC? POR FAVOR?!!!
Why can't I "like" this twice?!
Sen. Gillibrand just heard you drop the F bomb and loved it wish more Dem would follow your lead and examples!!  #StrongLeadingWoman

Yes!! And do @hellbentpod too!!
I love both podcasts and female f-bomb dropping! 
Great example you are setting for the kids in this country.  You have no class.  Hopefully you can mature and not act like a teenager.

Yes! please do it @SenGillibrand. Please consider using your platform to help us at the local level too! NY1 is ready for progressive change
