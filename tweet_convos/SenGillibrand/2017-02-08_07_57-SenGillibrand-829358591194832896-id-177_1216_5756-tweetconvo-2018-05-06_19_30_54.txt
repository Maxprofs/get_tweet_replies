Thank you for standing against Sessions. I appreciate your leadership. #resist #democracy
A Racist shouldn't be the AG of this country! Thanks Senator Gillibrand!
they let Obama Run it for 8 years, weren't worried about him being racist
-2 bad Reagan is not around to explain y he had to withdraw him as a judicial candidate- Unfit
but you guys are the party of 2nd 3rd and 4th chances people evolve
Keep up the good work!
Did you say the same thing about Racist Holder and Lynch? They also politicized the AG office.
I OPPOSE @SenGillibrand & WILL NEVER GET MY VOTE!! START WORKING & STOP PLAYING GAMES!!
Thank you. Keep up the good work. It's not going unnoticed.
Thanks, Sen. G, for representing us, your thoughtful, racially diverse and human rights-minded constituents!

Funny, I didn't hear you saying that about Holder or Lynch, both extreme leftist and racist.
thank you for standing up against @SenatorSessions! America isn't built on hate and prejudice.

Thank you for taking a stand against discrimination.  I appreciate your efforts #Neverthelessshepersisted
Thank you   No Sessions.  He is a racist and doesn't deserve the job!

Not too patriotic and a disgrace to our state. Grow up. Glad in my 30 yrs of service that all were loyal.

Thank You senator!
Thank you @SenGillibrand from a constituent. @SenatorSessions
Proud to be a New Yorker!
I Thank you @SenGillibrand  & as for you @SenatorSessions - learning more about your past has convinced me you have no place in the future.
Thank you for standing up for civil rights.  I'm proud to have you as my senator!
thank you! for standing up for the rights of all Americans and rejecting an Atty. General who might not do so -
thank you! Keep fighting for us
#Gillibrand2020 Thank you, Senator!
like eric holder did, fast and furios cartels killed americans with guns provided them by obama and holder
What happened to "we the people" "governed by the people" All this protest against unqualified ppl...#Fight
you haven't defended citizens rights, so how can you say he, @SenatorSessions, hasn't?
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR US!
thank you!
You are nothing but a political puppet. The man has an exceptional record. Who is pulling your strings.
YOUR strings are showing @VisionarySage as u cast aspersions on @SenGillibrand @SenatorSessions
. Please continue to object to Sessions. He is not a stable individual.
Yes! Oppose Sen.Sessions!
I salute your persistence. But ... Atty General sounds kind of cute #inappropriatebuttrue #ShePersisted
I am never moving as long as you are MY senator! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Read CSK letter, Senator Gillibrand
he does, you don't. Simple facts. #MAGA clearly without you. 
thank you Senator!
he would be a rubber stamp to continue the regime's illegal and uconstitutional actions
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand!!!!!
dear senator you would vote no if president Trump nominated the pope.
That's right @SenatorSessions you have a bad history of being a racist...SAD!
will @SenSchumer reject Jeff Sessions nomination as well?
Thank you Senator for standing up for the rights of ALL Americans. @SenatorSessions is not an appropriate pick for AG.
Thank you! #WeWillPersist
Keep on keeping on, Senator! You're making Brooklyn proud! #NoSessions
happy to have you as a leader in my state Kristen!
No surprise here!!
2/ @SenGillibrand @SenatorSessions It would be a step UP for him to passively accept discrimination/abrogation of rights
1 / @SenGillibrand @SenatorSessions He's worse than you paint. He's an active force FOR discrimination and suppression/oppression.
Seriously how can I show you I've got your back? Fan mail? Donations?
thank you Sen Gillibrand.
Support this 1,000%! Thank you Senator Gillibrand for standing up for us!!
Like Lorretta Lynch and Eric Holder did? If that's your idea of an AG, no thanks.
Which he will do by Enforcing the Law, but you guys are mad that he will enforce laws that wasn't enforced
You go, Sen Gillibrand!  This New Yorker is backing you all the way!
Sessions' character is represented accurately & with relevancy by Coretta Scott King's letter from 30yrs ago
Thank you @SenGillibrand for standing up for the truth and all of our rights. I'm proud to be a New Yorker!
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.
keep resisting
thank you, Senator Gillibrand
.@SenGillibrand @SenatorSessions thank you for leading the #resistance #persist we have your back!
Thank you Senator! I'm one of your constituents and continue to applaud your principled stands. Stay strong!
Senator Gillibrand, I appreciate all your efforts. Not at all comfortable with Sessions, very untrustworthy
pls stay on top of this. keep letting public know
Excellent job Senator! I'm very happy that you are standing strong.
all Democratic  Senators stand on Capitol steps each reading Mrs. Kings letter! Do it.
thank you Senator. keep the fight going against this dreadful administration
I oppose Senator Gillibrand being so disingenuous when she has done 0 to help her Delphi constituents. ZERO
senator has the knowledge,  experience and character tb r atty General.
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand!
You can reject all you want, this is about an agenda led by Bannon. He's your culprit. Stop the madness
Thank you @SenGillibrand for your opposition to @SenatorSessions. Please work to convince your @SenateGOP colleagues and #ResistTrump
Why is @SenatorSessions able to vote for cabinet nominees when he himself is a nominee? #Ethics #SeparationOfPowers #Conflict
We are noticing your leadership.  #StopSessions #StopTrump
Thank you!!
no sure why you are thanking the Senator
You are truly delusional. It will be my mission in 2018 & 2020 to campaign against you & all other corrupt NY politicians.
mine also...
thank you, @SenGillibrand , for your moral compass & your leadership! Our children are watching.
your children need parents who are guiding them. Shouldn't be watching her. Let the children 
Thank you, Sen. Gillibrand!!
Shocker
You shouldn't even be Senator puppet Kirsten. You're not qualified. Some think you bought your seat? 
some?!
thank-you so much for what you are doing to stop Sessions. He won't be good for America!
he is exactly what we need. Get rid of political bs. Drain the swamp
hopefully she'll leave soon.
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator! Brava!
thank you for opposing this bigot
Thanks @SenGillibrand.how about u? @SenSchumer
it's amazing that history will repeat itself because certain Republicans want no one to remember.
Thank You @SenGillibrand
As your constituent, I thank you for your opposition to @SenatorSessions as AG.
you might want to remind some of your GOP colleagues of this.
Thank you @SenGillibrand Your constituents are proud of you and the rest of the @SenateDems for opposing  @SenatorSessions nomination for AG
.@SenGillibrand @SenatorSessions He's done more about civil rights for the black community than Obama did. This is your last term.
god willing!
Thank you, Senator!
not politics. You can tell as mostly. When Trump first announced running for president in the year 2015. You saw how
Trump was acting. Trump was insult people, mocking people,  dissemination people ( it from people background where
there from ). Correct you should block Sessions nomination. How GOP acting. You can tell they follow Trump lead. Just saying
We need 3 GOP no votes and every dem. Sessions must be denied AG.
Of course u oppose one of Senate's most respected Senators. Sad.
"Most respected Senators" in La La Land maybe. And I'm not talking about the movie.
That's a quote from the liberals. Seriously?
Time to block another ignorant troll. God Bless You.
You can't block yourself though. But since you want to end the conversation (which suits me as well): Bye! 
Thank you!  #StopTheCoup
who is WE ?
Gee such an intellect reply.
*intellectual    We is Synthea & I.  New Yorkers.
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand!
YOU DA BEST GILLI
Agree. I think Sen. Sessions should withdraw his name from consideration.
you are the future of the Democrat Party. Keep fighting the good fight.
Pathetic that this has to be tweeted so you won't be silenced by the New Nazi Party.
#kirstengillibrand2020
keep fighting for us!
Thank you Senator
thank you, senator!
