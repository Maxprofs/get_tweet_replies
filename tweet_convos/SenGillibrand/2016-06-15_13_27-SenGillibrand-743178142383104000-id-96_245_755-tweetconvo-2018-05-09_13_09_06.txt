Your speech was powerful & heartfelt. Small correction: it was a Sig Sauer MCX, which is worse that an AR15.

You can try to change the law. But determined criminals only obey the laws of physics.

you are DOING GREAT! THANK YOU!
thank you! #enough #GVPfilibuster #StandWithOrlando #ChangeGunLawsOrChangeCongress #gunsensevoter
SIG Sauer MCX not AR-15. It doesn't matter for the argument, but might help with credibility.
The AR-15 cannot be fired hundreds of time per minute! Do more research!
Thank you, senator, for your impassioned words and support.

@SenatorLeahy Thank you for your support of common sense regulations. Bravo! #filibuster #Orlando #SandyHook
@ydanis @ChrisMurphyCT assault weapons should not be for public consumption.  "well regulated" has disappeared from debate

Great. Its a step forward.
I am once again proud that @SenGillibrand is my senator 

I hope one day she is POTUS
<~~so glad you are my senator @ChrisMurphyCT
