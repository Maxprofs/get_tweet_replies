the whole admin is anti-science and there'a reason why:

Trump is scary in his own right, but he is also the vehicle Christian extremists have used to overtake our government /2

Something's not right when the Kremlin is operating out of OUR White House! #KremlinCohorts #ImpeachTrump
There was a time in Germany where the people thought Nazi-ism was a good thing. Popularity doesn't make a thing right.
How is Earth's average temperature determined for before 1800's?
Geology.
Can you refer me to that study with average temperatures across the a Earth within a several degree delta.
The information's all on the graph. Don't troll me.
Oh, Scientific Consensus who were owned by the Obama Administration. Tell me this, why are the snow caps on mars melting.
Like when our DOE Sec. didn't even know the job controlled US nuclear arsenal?
sadly our epa chief has been in constant battle with epa for years, & was chosen to degrade, devalue & destroy dept.
He should resign for his lies to Congress.
You realize that it was once "widely accepted scientific consensus" that non-whites like me, had different brain capacity? @SenGillibrand
Thank you so much for standing up for common sense. Please keep hammering this point home. Unconscionable.
can think of about two dozen things that were once accepted by the scientific world as true beginning with flat earth
We absolutely must move past Tillerson+take matters in2 R own hands. Irresponsible 2do otherwise. Irresponsible2 point
as an employee in the solar industry, this is unconscionable.
we are on upward trend to tropical climes from last ice age data from the last 150 yrs much of it unreliable is not proof
ha ha, like the science of gun silencers
Something is not right when a former president vows to totally destroy and bankrupt the entire domestic coal industry.
Where is your outrage when Obama granted clemency to SAVAGE Convicted Domestic Terrorist? NY residents were murdered? Answer
It's fascism.
uh oh!!!....Doesn't look good USA!
science has changed dramatically over the years. Climate is changing, and has 4 millions of years &man had no affect on it.
And what do you no about GLOBAL WARMING you get your information from AL GORE
When will EPA,  Environmental Protection Agency name change to more accurate, EDA, Environmental Destruction Agency?
Just like we may predict a hurricane's path, but we can't change it. What we can do is to adapt to the changes and evolve with nature.
climate change has been taking place from the beginning of time. We should concentrate on learning to adapt.
Even in scientific community , it's a controversial topic. The climate on earth has evolved on  many different path historically.
"something's not right"? Seriously? You and I know very well what or rather who is not right #resist
. Good.  It's about time someone stopped repeating junk science.
isn't right when a lawyer is head of the EPA, brain surgeon HUD and head of education thinking bears are a threat
Ya' think?!!! #LobbyistsGotToPruitt #KickbackPruitt #RussiaRulesUSA
This was obvious during confirm hearings, where BTW, he reportedly perjured himself. He's in the pocket of fossil fuel corps.
You got that RIght! This is really messed up. Denying science doesn't do anyone any good.
@JJohnson2u - #SoldSouls to OIL/GAS corps, #Russia, #TrumpRussia ties! TRAITORS 2 USA & Constitution! #TrumpTrash gotta go
This government is making me ashamed to be an American.
@KariStuart Sounds good to me. If you'd said "proven evidence" instead of "widely accepted," I'd be worried.
There's no limit to how much this administration is willing to insult our intelligence.

something's wrong when E PA shovels cash to dem fronts
At least its accepted by scientists that agree with it . Like any theory it depends who you ask .
everything is not right!
corporations own the govt. Maybe @DNC will wake up and stop taking corporate money and fight 4 the ppl.
Let me know when a scientist says factories, gas and many other things are causing global warming.
HELLLOOO?? It's scientific that the planet is getting warmer for 100s of years.NOT SCIENTIFIC that WE THE PEOPLE R CAUSING IT
thank you for acknowledging this. This keeps me up at night!
isn't that why he was put there? To destroy all the progress we've made cleaning up our mess?
As a ny resident I'm confused by your comments. It snowed last week with blizzard slated for Tuesday. Global "warming"? @SenGillibrand
We have MUCH bigger problems than this flavor of stupid. We have a President that is destroying America!
EVERY Congress person should be shouting on EVERY TV and radio station, EVERYDAY, until Trump is arrested or impeached
Yes, and I think we all know exactly what it is that is wrong. Please keep fighting, for all of us.
well, the GOP can't rape & pollute our beautiful country to make billions cause of those darn meddling scientists.
something's not right when ur still in office and blabbering all the damn time
you’re a bit too polite here. Something is very, very wrong when: [the rest of what you said]
Collusion and corruption
that's why Trump picked him! In complete opposition 2 the job...like each cabinet member!
Pruitt is simply being loyal to the oil companies who have paid him for 30 years.
@sextonrm   The Everyone Pretends Agency
NOTHING is right. America is swiftly losing its standing in the world.
Just wait until he starts claiming that the flat earth believers prove there is no consensus the world is round.
let's pretend it's not cold as hell outside and politically motivated experts are correct.  #ClimateChange
Something's not right when a climate denier is confirmed as the head of the EPA and then is allowed to fire staff and gut programs.
Trump continues to surround himself with very stupid people. God help us all.
Get him out. He has surely violated an ethics rule or two. @nytimes
Sad joke to put climate change denier at helm of the EPA.
You keep using that phrase, "widely accepted scientific consensus." I do not think it means what you think it means #SneakTax
it is criminal ignorance. He should have read the reports by Elizabeth Kolbert, at the very least @ElizKolbert
Is ANYTHING right with the current admin? @GOP @POTUS @RepKathleenRice @SenateGOP @AnneFrankCenter @ItIzBiz @realDonaldTrump
um, no
@ItIzBiz @SenGillibrand @GOP @POTUS @RepKathleenRice @SenateGOP @AnneFrankCenter @realDonaldTrump
This administration will be the most anti-science ever. That's why I'll be marching April 22 @ScienceMarchDC

Remember when you defunded PP, fueled the worst HIV outbreak in Indiana's history, & then used Obamacare to clean up the mess you created? https://twitter.com/VP/status/834493747836682241 …
WAKE UP AMERICA YOUR COUNTRY Is BEING STOLEN BY THE RUSSIANS AND TRUMP
He thinks EPA stands for EXTERMINATE PLANET ABSOLUTELY!
Consensus doesn't mean truth. O gave billions to scientists supporting his belief, others disagree. let's give them money. Real science
How about when the budget director Mick Mulvany says that Obama administration was "manipulating" jobs data
when trump rents a space in trump tower to the Russian mob to conduct gambling operations trump is a sick sad little man SAD
Is he ignorant or a greedy bastard who cares more about oil companies' profit margin than the health of the American people?
The facts absolutely do not point to humans contributing to #climatechange . In 1978 it was ice age hysteria
He was appointed to oversee the dismantling of the EPA and aid in the destruction of US democracy. That's not right.
how do you expect the billionaire corporate C O to make money with all those laws in place let's dismantle EPA for Russia SAD
You are the ONE.  Take the lead. Expose these dilettantes. This guy was a joke, errand boy for industry in OK. Run him out.
Bought and payed for like all trumps clan!!!!!
it's all about the almighty dollar!
Except he didn't. http://ln.is/judithcurry.com/2017/G1VdY …
#oceanofsharks
mankind been responsible for climate change is total bullshit.
There is no shortage of incompetence in the Trump administration. Future generations will pay a heavy price
@DrXPsychologist he is an idiot who made my state earthquake alley and can't distinguish (quoted) Wikipedia from Wikileaks.
Science versus "Gut" opinion is always bullshit but in this case follow the money as always!
You say "widely accepted scientific consensus" 
We need to start saying "scientific fact."
They deny it because it gets in the way of profits for corporations that give them kickbacks.
Millions protesting are encouragement enough, for politicians to speak directly of what they imply. #ScottPruitt #PayToPlay
because he is a #FossilFuelStooge.  @EPAScottPruitt is a disgrace.
This is ridiculous @LeoDiCaprio I'm so sorry we are now surrounded by idiots 
When people who want to limit or stop the Government, are now in position to Run Government and their Agencies.

'Something's not right' is biggest understatement I've read since elections. Who expect anything else?
he denies the consensus of scientists, not those of tin hat foil wearing variety. They love him.
something real is the GOP has selfishly chosen ideological pets and power over a healthy future for all the world's children
it's a consensus on junk science
.@SenGillibrand what's wrong is too many corrupt shills for corporations allowed in office.Pruitt is the worst parroting Exxon.
What, exactly, are you "resisting?"
.@Deplorable_Ed @SenGillibrand
EPA admin @ScottPruittOK is a slave shill; it is a sad embarrassment for him to be in EPA. How can Marilyn stand site of him?
fake science
he's an idiot
do you think it might be because he is on the oil companies payroll???? Or is he just ignoring science??
Believes the same as his braindead boss.
Please fucking get rid of that guy, what is wrong with you America?
check his bank accounts and that will tell you what's up
No, the consensus is based on suspect data.  No temp change in over 16 yrs. Sea levels are steady. You need to look at this!
you could say up is down down is up and we're being bounced around in between
@sciencemarchnyc Agreed, something is not right...
Consensus is another word for sheep. Science isn't about consensus. It's about dissent. Right or wrong, he is dissenting.
