You are what passes for leadership now? Its a sad day in America.
You were saying?
Oh & if you dont like the outcome, then be adult about it & move on OR become better than the one you "oppose"! Not be worse! LOL
At least democrats don't want to make CHD an uninsurable condition.
Just to see that OC internist to have him sent to another OC ins cardi dr BECAUSE HIS CARDI DRS & SURGEONS WERE NOT OC DRS!  And he's on ...
The house bill would allow states to opt out of covering CHD and other pre-existing conditions. OC PREVENTS insurers from denying coverage..
Lastly, I will say this...the best thing out of OC Ins., was the fact children can stay I fam ins till 26.
My position is th@ Congress should have kept OC & worked to improve the aspects of it that were failing in a bi-partisan way. Thats just me
I will donate $100 to your campaign for every swear word if you run in 2020. 
No way! Stop whining and grow up!!!
Kristen is rude and careless!!!!

Your point? He wasn't president yet!
Armando, you missed the point. He wasn't an elected official when he made those remarks...SHE IS! #YOUARETHEFUCKINGMORON
There is no period except from the blood coming out of @SenGillibrand "whatever". When was he saying FUCK a specific person? #demsnorespect
Profanity is the Hallmark of a weak mind trying to express itself forcefully
Meet the weakest of them all
The weakest mind you say? Leave his Presidential win over Hillary out of it. He built an empire. That sounds amazing to me.
see one of ur friends sent out this tweet, and in response I... u know what, explaining w/d take all day. Be well
Profanity is the Hallmark of a weak mind trying to express itself forcefully
What?
Enjoy the rest of your day Mark
You too.
The replies to this are people angry about F-bombs from a woman but voted for a sex offender.
My thoughts exactly. Also the same people that voted for someone who assaulted a reporter but the F bomb means no class? Double standards.
Can both actions not be classless?  You've missed the point entirely
Thanks for your help but I made the point I wanted to make.
Actually you did not make a point at all
Yes, dear, I'm sorry your reading comprehension skills are low. Double standards. That was my point.
yep, true story - cupcake!
Bill Mahr, reality winner, sen gillabrand, comey, Kathy griffin,Reza,Ramon Perez! How is that resistance going for you libtards
It's a sapphire ring and just a fun bauble ring. I have many in traditions.
Your mirror must really be broken because where were you for the 8 years of Obama lies and scandals??? YOU should resign!!!
You mean Obama make Believe scandal &lies? The left part of your brain wasn't working for 8 years
Your resisting is creating an environment of hate mongers and is not right. Some of your constituents don't know where the fine line is
I had at that point suffered 5 concussion and more followed. Place is overrun with dinosaur lizards and it was critical care/rest fully.
His separated and fully divorced and annulled wife actually just had died following and chasing him. My amnesia is recovering now as well.
You are a grown woman why in the world would you use fowl language at a speech. It is not cool it is nasty
You are an embarrassment
you should be ashamed. Your foul mouth is unwelcome. You will never be President. You are no role model and simply a phony.
I think he may wonder why you are wearing it if he sees it on you and reads this. He may ask you what occurred. Tell him if you remember.
This ring on your hand was mine as a promise ring from my Henry not the IMF Henry. It was stolen. It's fine. Keep it if you like it.
Hey Gillibrand! Stop using F language! You are not classy woman! You are still corrupted and crooked politician!!
Nice potty-mouth there senator.  Great example you set, nice to see you can be the adult in the room.  SMH
Yes, #45 is the picture of elegance & class we should all be emulating. SMH
Tell me what you know of Liberty, freedom and democracy.  Can you do it without ad hominem, strawman arguments and vitriol?  Bet you can't.
I see you're tweeting with your dictionary tonight. You are obviously very smart.
I see you are very sarcastic and childish.  Well done.  You haven't answered my questions however.
I'm just so intimidated by your superior intellect.
Liar
I am not surprised in the least that you are a Trump supporter.
It's a sapphire and diamond ring. It's fine. You liked it when he gave it to me. It's Pierre Henry.
Particularly disappointed in your choice of words.  Forget putting money in the swear jar, maybe a public apology would be better
We need 99 more like you thank you Madame senator
You obstruct Trump at every turn and then you say he's not keeping his promises.  I love it.  Great work.
Yep - amazing work. #Resist
You kiss your children with that mouth?
Does Trump Kiss Ivanka with his? Bet he does
LOL your followers seem as low class as you are
Speaking of low class
sorry not much of a Trump fan either. I don't care for anyone who drops F Bombs period
There's nothing funny about an elected leader expressing themselves publicly in this way. It's offensive & makes u look desperate4attention
I never more proud of you being my senator I knew it was something great about you you go girl
"It's not about the party, it's about the people."

Wish every single elected official would remember this.
Thanks.
Nice thanks
Aren't you cute. Are you the example you want Americans to follow?  You have no clue about what Americans think or need. #GTFH
why you just a FOUL mouth little TWIT......
I don't care about your cursing or lack of class, only about your disregard for the Constitution.
Not Senatorial. Not Professional. Vote Republican.
"Fighting and resisting"? How about just voting. You know?...democracy? But yet you want to "fight". Crazy, vicious new ager.
 you get all of the happy faces!
Preach
don't you dare apologize, excellent statement and 100% accurate.
I find you to be someone who does not listen. Your message is often wrong and often worded carefully so as to deceive people.
That's what you should do !
No please!! Keep doing the same thing you're doing a great job, now we now how you talk to your kids.
So why haven't you gone home?  All you democrats do is obstruct.
You are the epitome of what you claim your speach should be against. Corrupt self enrichment at taxpayer expense. F.....you 
Should people who don't have the vocabulary to express themselves without vulgarities be in public office?
As a Senator representing people aren't you totally ashamed of yourself? RESIGN!
As a human being, aren't you?
My niece asked to have a clown at her birthday party.Are you available?It will be a very young crowd so I am sure you are cool with that
So, the vulgarity was okay because you were talking to a younger crowd? What's that tell you about the so-called YOUNGER CROWD? Dimwit!
running out of talking points that the use of profanity is all you got in order to connect with a younger group? #lame #STILLnotwinning
#NoClass ... Just saying. Whatever happened to dignity, self-respect, and polite society.
Poor example to Theo and Henry... were you just trying to be "cool" to your younger audience?
Playing the HilRod game.. talking at a younger audience and ran out of actual points, lets swear and keep it "real"
Your an outstanding example of a #Democrat
Just wonder, is filthy, foul, vulgar words all you got ??? Not a very high bar to set for Dems 
So it's okay for the younger crowd to use profane and vulgar language? Is that what you're saying? SHAME ON YOU!
Freak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You must be a real treat to be around
great example-swearing in front of young people. No ideas to help-swear!! Focus is still on your incompetence
Wow. No class. I am sure your kids are so proud to have a mom that sounds like a sailor.
Do you use that language on your children?? I'm no prude but even my father didn't use that word. And no you weren't sorry. No class!!!
Wtf I didn't vote for you to go around acting like a jerk
Do you kiss your kids with that mouth?
Put money in the swear jar tonight? How is that going to change the minds of children who now feel justified in using the "F bomb?" SHAME!
Truly disgraceful for a US Senator to use this language. Respect the office if you do not respect for yourself. There is NO excuse for this!
Outstanding speech...way to 'show the way' Senator F***meister!
You used to seem sane. Sad.
Totally living in that tiny bubble there. After the deportations you lib's are finished. Uncouth . #ExDems4Trump2020
Grown professional people really should be able to express their thoughts without using crude language.
Whata potty mouth you have! You should be totally embarrassed! How UNprofessional..You lack intelligence and it's so obvious!
you are not my senator & trust me, you will never be my Pres, so you can stop the foul language, It was false & ridiculous
Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes—these are not for you. Instead, let there be #thankfulnesstoGod.
Ephesians 5:4 NLT
Don’t use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words willbeanencouragement#tothose whohearthem
The F Bomb is beneath you. It also diminishes your talk. A bad example for our and YOUR children. Your vocabulary has much better words.
Cheap to try to be relevant through swearing. Makes u look silly to young ppl.
That's it?  All the DEMS have now is their stupid RESIST??  Someone should wash your mouth out with soap .. no one to look up to for sure
Wow. What epic fail. Accept your loss and move on. Quit spreading hate & division when we should be coming together in unity. Stay classy
You are the type of Democrats who's behavior push @realDonaldTrump over the top, thxs Your PROFANITY was obviously written into the speech.
You're dangerous and evil. Spreading hate it not what you got elected to do  @RandPaul @SenBookerOffice
. You think you were real cute dropping F word for World to hear when really you came off as immature with NO moral compass Shame on you!
@SenGillibrand Nice speech! I remember the first time I cussed - I was determining who's a nastier woman, you or Senator Warren.  Disgusting
Wow, what a mouth on a lady and Senator. Shame on you. Dems talk about Trump. And you lied about Trumps campaign promises.
Lost me with the first swear word!   Reduces you to a low life!
Outrageous lies about @potus. Never heard of you b4 wash your mouth out w/soap speech. Hate makes things worse. You need therapy
.@1choice Kirsten the curser. You like being a foul mouth ? 
Why?  You should clean that dicksucker up. Or swallow. Ha ha ha
So sad that you just killed my hopes for the DNC with your gutter mouth. Trump really has your number. Hate to see u mentally breakdown.
Time to STOP fighting lady and get on board. You are harming the country with your hatespeak. Certainly your base will become weary of this.
Your foul mouth reflects your upbringing, diminishes your office and you should do more then swear to justify your salary
The F word does not become you; unfortunate, you did not need it to make your point.
Shame on you! You should respect yourself and the office you've been elected too! What are you showing our young people!

Another potty mouthed female Dem. (No amt of "Special Interest" cash in swear jar makes up for it) NOT a role model for my 5 granddaughters!
You complain about GOP; but your only vision & msg appears to be "fight and resist" - what? the improved VA? Stop parroting @HillaryClinton!
Are there ANY issues you can get involved with in a constructive way? Is NY "Infrastructure" important? Is "Child trafficking" of concern?
#SaveACA We need transparency in the Senate health care proceedings. It is undemocratic
people who curse generally are lacking in intelligence or you will say anything to placate the youth
How people like you are elected is beyond me. Not only untruthful but incompetent. http://goo.gl/xB83D9  #maga #AmericaFirst #dts #tcot
Great speech?More like potty-mouth rants!This is your"greatness"showing what?Seriously?When Dems became crude w/radical behavior,we said bye
Sure sign of a loser - when you start swearing everyone knows you have lost.
Swearing means I'm not smart enough to be persuasive so I add shock value. 

Vote her out!
Gillibrand is looking to be a career politician. Vote out. We need people who work with @POTUS.
Great speech sometimes the jar needs to be filled
You think you're really cute, don't ya! Your grandchildren must be so proud, we hope they'll emulate you at school. #STFU  #YaCupidStunt 
I BET THEO AND HENRY ARE PROUD OF MOMMY.. WHAT A PIG..
You're 60, not 16. Act your age old girl
This is not something you should be proud of
Seen Gillibrand needs to be replaced next election as obstructionists she is killing her own citizens and destroying America!!
I'm sure Theo & Henry are proud of their foul-mouthed mom. Your constituents & family deserve an apology. You are now Chief Senate Vulgarian
#LOL@DemocratsLOL #MAGA #TRUMP
@SenGillibrand Not very lady like. You should be ashamed. #TermLimits
Doing a crap job. U r resisting making America great again? Have u forgotten who u work for?
And I Bet you get a lot of cash don't u?
SWEARING, HOW UNCOUTH! A LADY, NOT! WHAT AN EXAMPLE FOR YOUR KIDS... GO WASH YOUR MOUTH WITH LYE SOAP!
Your vulgarity merely shows your lack of vocabulary and that you're a disgusting person.  Great mom?
I'm sure the parents of children in your district are pleased.  Profanity replaces intelligent thought, you should be better.
Hey Kirsten! Talk'in dirty ain't very ladylike ya know. Too late for that anyway huh....
You are an embarrassment and shame on you!
Swearing by DEM's Emblematic. Expected 4 Atheists, Pagans, Satanists who deny G-D Reject 10 Commandments. Pro Abortion (Murder) Gay Marriage
Tell that to the families of Vets who died waiting for care at the VA under Obama.
When having to resort to using Profanity, you have no valid platform. Your message is lost.  Run in 2020 so you can lose again.
DemocRATS are shameful.  Now their motivation is to curse every chance they have.  Shameful!
Why do you want to resist a good economy and people getting jobs...  You want Trump to fail,more than America succeed.  Sad for a Senator...
The Gillibeast she is popularly referred to around the military could do all a favor and resign.  She's useless and waste of taxpayer money.
To Ms. Gillibrand's parents...Great job raising such a foul mouthed individual.  You must be so proud!
Instead of fighting and resisting, how about working to create more well paying jobs and getting rid of reckless and harmful immigration?
Don't change a thing.  
Fantastic!
working together for American people instead of resisting your resistance is futile.  constituents will hold you accountable in NY election
A senator using profanity in a speech; you're a disgrace to the Senate.  Do you teach your kids to talk that way!
What happened to civility and respect. You can get your point across in public without using the fbomb.
By the way I agree with rest of your message. Both sides need 2 work together 4 us, we insist
If you are what is supposed to be admired as a representative, it's a sad day in America. You think it cute to curse? Joe Biden look alike?
Crass & low class! What a great example your showing impressionable kids - including your own.  #whendemsgolow
your disdain w/Trump's performance but yet all you want to do is resist?  Healthcare & taxes prob won't change then...BYE
Certainly behavior not fitting for a senator. You would fit right in a trailer park.
Too bad it is too late for the Democratic Party.  You all have shown yourselves to be hateful, manipulative, easily bought and terroristic.
I can't this enough!
You are just under f....g politician have no idea what people need and you never gonna f...g learn - EVER!!.all u know is the word resist 
Classless, crass and not a good example to those of us who want to keep the bar raised.
Grassroots
U keep on using the word resist what? yet ur 401k is making U $ U have no f..g clue what people need, no clue so pls continue your downfall
Why so foul mouthed? Do you have no class, dignity or self respect? Typical of your ilk. Degenerate thought and practice. BAD!
