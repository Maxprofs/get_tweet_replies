Okay @HillaryClinton @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris please announce a run for 2020, any day now:)
Gillibrand 2020. Biden could put Harris on ticket. Please Clinton do not run
I'd rather vote for a man who had great ideas then a woman who had shit ideas. There is no place for sexism in this world.
Great candidate in Bethlehem! @pmiwanowicz @enckj
I know one scientist thinking about running! @trish_zornio for Sen in Colorado 2020. Please follow her!
Thanks! @SenGillibrand I would be honored to talk should you be willing. I'm exploring U.S. Senate CO 2020 (Gardner). #electascientist
Yes! @SarahPalinUSA
I know a strong, smart, female scientist that's considering a run in CO! @trish_zornio - follow her! @500womensci
Thanks Wendy! I hope @SenGillibrand can hear our tweets! 
This Nation needs more women to take decision.
Hey, if Kid Rock?? Why not someone whose actual job is critiquing policy?
@iamsambee @FullFrontalSamB #senategiants
In just one week, @LifeAfterHate has gotten halfway to its goal. Let’s get them the rest of the way. https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/897203801614057474 …
@laurenchivee run please.
Why is that a problem if the men earned their position? Stop using your vagina as a campaign slogan. What are your thoughts on real issues?
And when you ask her, send her our way -->>
I am a Dem looking at running for a GOP held state office in NY.  I am interested.
Thanks for your interest in running for office @Shuana_weexist! We can help you- just head to
Still waiting on u to pop the question....
Nicole Malliotakis is running for Mayor. As an UES constituent I urge you to endorse her.
@Holly Gordon @susanmcph
I know a woman who should leave office. Representing this country does not depend on skirts/pants, it depends on qualificatns & sound thkng!
Has anyone else noticed that T does not have a deaf interpreter when he addresses America?

HOW ABOUT YOU? PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 2020?
No
Hillary...I still want her to be President.
Why?
I have Senator, my sister. Perhaps a call or card from you could help push it forward.
Hi
You should run for president in 2020!
Especially if she is a Republican!!! 
Why does it have to be a woman? Why not just a good candidate?
SEXIST!
Just as long as you run in 2018 @SenGillibrand one of the giant women of the Senate and my Senator.
Do it, @rmcgrudiva 
Oh, wow!

Damn. My twitter address & Gillibrands & that gif altogether in one tweet. Comb Over you ROCK.
A few I can think of. @LonnieRhea @marybethpf @PhyllisMervine
Aww. Thanks Michele. My sister-in-law ran for council last year. Gives me hope. @SenGillibrand @marybethpf @PhyllisMervine
I know one.  She retweeted you and is listed after you on the replying to list above.
Even conservative ones?
Yes Me as a Republican to stop the democRATS corruption!
How about the BEST person rather than a woman or a colored person or a transgender person?  That's what's wrong with America and politics
I know one who has! @ElaineDiMasi for NY-1!
I do and she is! Her name is Dr. Hiral @hiral4congress & she's running to unseat @RepTrentFranks in Arizona
Please contribute & support her!
I've thought about it.  Not sure where to start.
Chelsea Clinton
Chelsea Clinton.
@IngrahamAngle she would be better than anyone else! Ms Ingraham take the plunge!
Oprah￼
Nikki Haley, Mia Love, Karen Handel...   Did you support any of these strong, intelligent women?
Trumps daughter would make a great senator
@area0303 mom you should run!
I did! And she's running for Congress against Dave Reichert in WA-8! Check out http://drkimschrier.com  & show her some love!
Yes! And then be her first donor and her first volunteer.
I am hoping that those running get solidarity and support like speaking invites. Especially those rejecting lobby $s like @kathieallenmd
It is time for women to clean the House, of Congress that is! Only 20% of U.S.Congress is women. May they gear up for 2018!
U R a beacon senator
As long as her name isn't Hillary Evil Clinton have at it
@DrCSWilliam I know a powerful & brave woman who did just that! @HeatherforAZ just changed life from health care to politics!
The problem is, we need liberals living in red States
I'll vote for you Kirsten.
Why not Zenia? Y'know-daddy's one-time tart?  Smarter than you, tougher than you and unlike your gilded rise, up from her bootstraps.
Can't believe I'm saying this but especially Repub women. The few GOP senators with any semblance of a conscience are primarily women.
Extremely needed
Yes!! Liberal hate and bigotry and intolerance is giving rise to a new wave of conservative women ready and able to run for office!!!
@amyklobuchar #amyforpresident
Not you.  You support BDS
More women will hopefully consider it.
Do you know a person...
Soon as that person files legally...give that person..and bring sources of financial support Words & solid back up
I would run in a second if I knew how to get started.
I want to I just don't know what to run for. Senate?
Shout-out to @erinvilardi of @voterunlead, an organization that trains women of all political persuasions to run for office. Check it out!
Ok I'm asking you to run for president. Form exploratory committee. It puts u out there preempt Cuomo, warren, clinton, Biden, Harris etc
The thought of constantly having to raise money is just daunting. What's the solution?
I don't know you personally but you're my senator. SO, Senator Gillibrand will you please  enter the race for 2020? 
My good friend is running for county judge in a county that has NEVER elected a Dem judge (Delaware County, PA). She could use your help!
Feel free to make a donation at
My wife @ShawnaBlack17 is already running!
But you Senator Kirsten Gillibrand always care my situation. Thank you.
I support an activity of the woman politician. But whether woman or man politician, they must not undermine morale of their supporters.
I'm running for mayor of the City of Cortland
@pallmendinger

I know a few who should run from their offices. That would be any female working in the WH.
I don't know if I should, but I'd like to one day.
How about you, Kirsten?  I also like Rep. Val Demimgs--very presidential.
How's impeachment coming?
Would love to, but live in a completely red town and mostly red county.  :(
I did. I won.
Where do I begin?
@kriswaldherr Hmmm?
This racist, homophobic, misogynistic, narcissistic Nazi in the WH must be REMOVED #ImpeachDonaldTrump
Umm, hey Kristen, have you ever considered running for President? Just asking. Today.

#Resist
Hmmm. Seems like that should be you Kirsten.
 ehhhhhh no but love you anyways 
I heard Ayaan Hirsi Ali may run for your seat. You ok with that? Will you cheer her on? LOL
Hillary Clinton won't go away.
Look at the Seattle's mayoral race. A woman for mayor once about a 100 years ago. The top 4 candidates for mayor in 2017: all women.
@HillaryClinton #Hillary2020
Not all women are good candidates. @RepMcSally is agreat prime example.
I've asked her. She's a Republican who would run against a democratic incumbent. Here's hoping.
If I had ANY idea how to even get started, I would run...
Kristen for President 2020. 
Senator Gillibrand please run for president
I tell my wife everyday to run against Russia luvin' Dana Rohrbacher...
Then tell her 2 apply 2 @EmergeAmerica. When  run win same rate as men. Our alums win 70% of races, even red states, doubles your success!
No worries @SenWarren aka @ElizabethForMa is waiting the bullpen preping 4 2020 in case @BernieSanders somehow doesn't run. #TyTLive
We did. And when they all said no, @mdevitojr felt he had to run for Congress. Yes to more women! But yes FROM women too!
#LetsRunTogether
I'll support any Dem woman who supported Hillary.
So many! RBG's "when there are nine" quote comes to mind, too.
How about you put your name in the running for 2020.
@Dorothy410berry ?
@PoonamGi11!!
Please support @MikieSherrill, a former Navy pilot/federal prosecutor & mother of 4, in her bid to flip NJ's 11th and defeat @USRepRodney!!
Me
I don't care one iota if it is a man or woman-just get this nutcase out and Democrats get their shit together
Would love to run but can't afford to stop working to campaign #hatchact
Plunge? Perfect word! Right into your swamp!
