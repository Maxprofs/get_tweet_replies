Exactly how many people and biz have left NYS since Cuomo elected? How much higher is Upstate unemployment vs national avg?
So the fix is to tell people to move? Problems started long before Cuomo. It was manufacturing which is gone and Trump isn't bring back.
True, it started 60 yrs ago. Guess what leadership it was under. But disclosing a fact is not running away
You are full of it. How many NY republicans ended up in jail? The gov changes but the meat of upstate elected officials are republicans
You mean like way Sheldon Silver got caught red handed violating law for decades & didn't serve a day in jail?
Dean Skelos is serving 5 years. Let's not forget who was running Crookhaven. Jailing GOP there is a pastime for decades.
Good point. The convicted former Dem leader gets away clean, Republican gets punished. NY politics in action.
No, both parties have members sent to jail. There are just so many more republicans. FYI, lived in Crookhaven, watched it all happen 70s>>>
Thank you. Upstate NY knows better. HRC brought some jobs, Trump says move. Explains approach in a nutshell
.... he lie, lie, lies like a rug...
Upstate NY is creating really high paying jobs not the shitty ones minimum wage jobs Foxcom will create.
This is just another Trump lie exposed. What about jobs, jobs, jobs?
Thank you @SenGillibrand for your response! Upstate NYer's don't need to be told to give up, we need support for infrastructure development.
These jobs ain't gonna pay much!! Plus Foxcom already bailed on PA before!
Sure Yours Aren't?

and after a depraved week when you think you may have heard the worst #trump encourages #policebrutality on national tv! #magasux
Dear @SenGillibrand @students4brindi what's you opinion on the Downtown Utica hospital concept? An inner-city hospital district your wish?
Consider the source. Most of us in Queens don't agree with him.
He thinks the Upper West Side is Upstate.
Wonder how the residents of Wisconsin will like working for Foxcomm? Because no New Yorkers I know would tolerate them.
Melania should start her efforts against bullying by educating her husband. What a disgraceful example for our children.
Why? People are hurting & NY doing little to bring jobs back to upstate NY. Our leaders too busy running for office & politicking.
As a fellow Upper New Yorker I can concur, Senator. Next time you see that charade of a man in DC can you kindly give him  for me?
It's not just that Trump is an @$$hole. It's that he's such a consistent relentless @$$hole. (Pardon language but I'm from upstate NY, too.)
You support Linda Sarsour! She advocates for Sharia Law! Resign from politics! You are dangerous to America!
For some reason you lost your bearing   when you went to Washington!
What is upper NY
We've already been on this ride
I think he should pack his bags. I'll help!
I couldn't believe it! Just incredible!
Last time I checked "Upper New York" was still growing economically. There is nothing that would entice me to become a cheesehead.
Ooh, after all that hard work Quomo put into bringing jobs upstate?? Dems be fighting words!

High taxes, unjustified min wage increase - "free" collage, 12 wks paid leave (employee funded) free abortions( new proposal) rising cost
The truth hurts - BTW do you know where the highest rate of people leaving NYS state is from? Chautauqua county - second Catt county
All you need to do it take into account that they were made by @POTUS the most #ignorant president in history.
Agreed.I have lived all over NYS. Not a native, check my bio. Have seen the devastation caused by the loss of manu in NYS.
What is ignorant are the ppl who voted you and Sen Forehead in!
He's never made a trade deal, He knows more about it than I do, sure. But, if I were hiring someone, I wouldn't interview him
I wonder what street upper starts on?
Everything the man says is filled w ignorance.
New Yorkers to @realDonaldTrump:  Pack YOUR bags to move to Siberia!!!
 from Tompkins County. Grateful for you Senator Gillibrand.
That man is absolutely certifiable and needs to be confined. What a jackass he is and he is embarrassing our country, besides ruining it.
thank you
Decades of dem policies have made Upstate N.Y. uncompetitive to attract business and jobs. If u don't understand that then ur the ignorant 1
Is Trump going to pay their moving costs? I highly doubt it. I don't know who writes his stuff but they tend to think like does. No brains!
Wow, the truth really hurts alot of people.  Moved out, now have no state income tax and a lower cost if living.
As some1 livin in Upstate NY I can tell u ppl r already & have been leaving. We r struggling  because of dem policies. Open ur eyes b honest
Why did you sell your house in Greenport Gellybrain? People are voting with their feet and leaving NY in droves @realDonaldTrump is right.
Ignorant people make ignorant comments.
Yeah but you didn't stay here, did ya?
Why are they ignorant comments ? Fact is the job market in upstate NY is dismal at best. Start up NY was a waste of tax dollars
Unfortunately @SenGillibrand we r Stuck Listening 2 #NotMyPresident spew #HATE & Lies unless we #ImpeachNow ° #TheResistance Awaits Action
Build that wall !!!!!
doesn't matter where we were born and raised, only someone who was hatched could be that ignorant
Did NY Secede? Because the last time I heard @potus is supposed to be the leader of all 50 states
I have a better idea! I'll stay and you can pack your bags! Please don't ever step a foot back in New York again!
Wisconsin? What the hell is the difference between Wisconsin and Pakistan, or Bangladesh? All 3 are despotic hell holes!
It's the truth. With Cuomo at the helm, there won't be anything in upstate new york except higher taxes. Might as well abandon.
Better to be ignorant that an elected official that lies to get bills passed
You still don't get it.
What is ignorant is thinking people will stay here if there are better offer elsewhere.  Again get in the game or get off the field.
I've lived whole life in NY: Long Island, NYC, Westchester, Albany, Buffalo. 

And I've never heard anyone call upstate "Upper New York."

Is the health of America, our lives, to be voted upon a party line? 
Of all votes, shouldn't our LIVES get #Bipartisan committees &hearings?
You dems need to figure out that your socialist policies are job killers and that the state of New York is a prime example of that.
Well said Senator Gillibrand. We "upper New York" staters aren't going anywhere. Except to the polls.
Upstate NY is competing globally for technology investment, and succeeding, despite the sentiments of this President.
