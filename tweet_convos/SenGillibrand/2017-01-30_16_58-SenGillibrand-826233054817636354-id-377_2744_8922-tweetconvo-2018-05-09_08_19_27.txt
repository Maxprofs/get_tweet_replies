u think u might say something smart don't u think it's time to quit fighting rioting actingchildish your parties in thetoilet
We are with you Senator!
Does fighting simply mean rejecting all Trump appointments without valid reasons? You have no credibility.
you are our hero. Huge thanks and support from the West Coast. Stay strong!
please rally for a boycott of red states. If we stop buying American goods from red states, it would send a powerful message
@SenSchumer @TheDemocrats @SenateDems must learn from @SenGillibrand on how to put ppl ahead of politics & vote NO on Trump's #SwampCabinet
We cannot express our gratitude to you as the sole Dem senator to stand firmly against Trumps #SwampCabinet.
Mrs President...
you don't know how to do any of those things. You're a feminist liberal! Lol go scream and cry
Q4JeffS If as AG, u r not convinced an Executive Order is lawful or just, what will happen?

Politically motivated! Not impressed. Sorry I agave you my vote!
As a resident of NY, I oppose Scott Pruitt's nomination to head EPA,. I appreciate you calling out his extreme positions.
Please no confirmation for SCOTUS until trump/Putin/election tampering fully investigated.
THANK YOU, for being a strong leader and standing up for what's right and against this tyrannical "leader".
DEPOSE bannon NOW he is a danger to nation neo nazi white supremacist misogynistic while*rump watches movies he makes policy
You must be soundly defeated.
We only need to fight ISIS. Everyone & everything else can be discussed in peace.

I support all your doing. Also I hope you do not support the Supreme Court nominee.
Please oppose nomination of Gorsuch to #SupremeCourt to protect #WomensRights
You are my hero. Thank you for having our backs.
Stop the nonsense.  We all know he is an excellent pick and is very qualified.
say no to a Fed Judge that was unanimously voted in when appointed b4? Childish. I am a reg independent. I will not vote 4 u.
I second that !
Will you actually stand with the resistance, or will you normalize Trump and give his extreme SC nominee a vote?
Please keep it up!! We need you. We are with you.
.@SenGillibrand @ChrisMurphyCT @SenSchumer @SenWarren Keep fighting! Vote NO to Betsy DeVos, Sessions, and company!
@LisaHauser8 Thank you Senator!
Thank you Sen. for being the only one to represent our voice, the sane and scared American by your votes. We appreciate you.
.@SenGillibrand ...but YES is the answer.  Even master lib nutter Yoko Ono knows that.
Thank you!!
So you officially labeling the Democratic Party the party of NO.
you better get back to work or we will vote you out of office next election. Democrats are becoming obstructionist.
sad that it seems the only Senator with balls, happens to be a woman
we have come too far to turn back now.  Gillibrand 2020
Thank you for your courage in opposing Trump's vile nominees.  Why aren't more Democrats (especially Schumer) doing the same?
Now that is the kind of leadership we need from a US President.
..  yes
we have to do our jobs and get on board with your elected president. Wait you didn't think of that.
Thank you!!
Any replacement for Obamacare must include psychological therapy for liberals.
@susurrant #StopPresidentBannon
Senator, I'll trade you my set of balls for your balls any day of the week. You're fighting real good.
Thank you, Senator.  Pat from DuluthMN
we're counting on you
Thank you for your continued advocacy!
you also have to say "yes" to keep our govt functioning. You've made your point
When a Senator paraphrases Bob Marley... 
You know it's getting real
Stop 'fighting' and do your job!-honor your oath of office. You better pray President Trump is not successful.
Thank you for standing up for us!   We want our all of our democratic reps to say no to all of Trump's candidates.
you are a joke
Keep fighting. Keep voting no. Please consider withholding consent and filibuster later. NY needs you.
we must take a closer look at POTUS #25amendment
Thank You! Please continue to persuade those Republicans  who can be reached to block nominations of the inept & corrupt
& we must cross the aisle. We need 2 reach out 2 our republican friends out there. Preaching to the choir doesn't work!!!
No fight will not stand or be heard so long as corrupt Marxist de Blasio is Mayor of NYC.
I hope the people of NY know what an AWESOME junior senator they have! Thank you for standing up!!
#WeWillNotBeAssimilated

Thanks for your leadership!!!!  Glad to know we Democrats have someone who is doing the right thing consistently!
YES This is NOT my immigrant parents' America #DumpTrump #DemsSayNO #Indivisible #NoBanNoWall #NotMyCircusNotMyMonkeys
where was all this outrage when demos controlled senate and WH but sat back and watched Syrians get slotterered ie red line?
Judicial and legislative statements needed-in the meantime let the banned Nations submit reports on intending migrants to US.
have to fight, stand strong, not give up. Delphi retirees are doing all 3!  & we will win inspire of no support from you!
@AmyAyers16 @JoeManchinWV tell this idiot that does no longer represent Dems in WV and who will be primaries out
Thank you. Please listen @SenBillNelson #Resist #JustSayNo
Thank you, Senator! Keep up the good fight!
When you object to and protest everything you and your message will loose credibility. U WILL be seen as the sore loosers u r
It's a temporary ban. Obama did it to Iraq but no protests then. Irrational hypocrites are lookin like bigger asses every day
Please object to any new legislation until this heartbreaking Muslim travel ban is lifted. You are giving us hope, representing us.
We are running out of time to save our democracy. #Impeach
Thank you, keep up the great work! Thrilled to hear this from my Senator! Women RULE!
Yes!  #resist #WomensMarch
@GovHowardDean  tell other Dems that, we'll be watching
Oh, Senator, my Senator -- thank you, thank you, thank you.
your job is to support the president.  Stop the obstruction!
I like the way your roll @SenGillibrand https://twitter.com/SenGillibrand/status/826233054817636354 … I hear a little @RepJohnLewis influence in those words
We have to fight.
We have to stand strong.
We have to say no.…
Thank you for standing up for human rights!
No to what? Fight for what? Who says you have to give up or give in? What do you want you don't have?
Good job. We are behind you. The world is watching and you are making history for the better.
So proud u r my Senator! Use your most extreme measures to fight these most extreme times, we will be behind you & with you.
Stay strong. I literally thank God you're my Senator. From a 65 year old Christian minister in CNY
.@SenGillibrand Thank you!  Please encourage your fellow Dems in the Senate to find their spines.  
Thank u for fighting 4 our country! Have u seen this requirement for Bannon to be confirmed for NSC?
Breaking: obscure law requires Sen confirmation for WH aide like Bannon to serve on NSC. 50 U.S. Code § 3021  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/3021 …
Thank you Senator. As long your with us, we're with you.
You are an inspiring American hero, Senator!!
I think you show such courage.  Stay strong.  You rock!
keep working hard #resist
Tell Chuck Schumer and Feinstein. They need to get with the program. No cooperation from the senate.
Get the feeling D and R's in Congress have no idea what's going on. We are absolute terrified. I'm frightened for my family
Yes! Thank you for standing strong in your convictions and in representing those of us who voted for you! Dont let us down!
keep fighting!
excuse me,wasn't my president  elected by the very people you ARE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT?
I was just going through and following all democratic senators and reps. That did not take long at all!
You look like you would be more intelligent than your words and actions though, but thank you anyway!
Thank you for kowtowing to the most radical parts of your party. We already got the unions we will take more though.
YOU MUST SHUT UP AND DO YOUR JOB...You're supporting terrorism, racism, bigotry, sexism and so much worse. Shameful, for what
Thank you for voting against Trump nominees. We must fight against Trumps nominee for the Supreme Court
Senator, what are you going to do about Trump's purge of the acting Attorney General?
I wish all the Senate Dems were as principled as you. Thank you!
@GovHowardDean these just seem like words now
fight for us !!!! No on all trump cabinet
