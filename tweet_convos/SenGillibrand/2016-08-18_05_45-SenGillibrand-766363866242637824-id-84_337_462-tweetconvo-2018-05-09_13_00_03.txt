@WIRED @HillaryClinton
bad judgement and faulty logic

"...Now it has moved into George Orwell–as–interpreted–by–Paul Verhoeven territory."
Better if you stayed with tech rather than help spread lies.
becuase you have proven to have no brain
It would mean 4 years #corporate and #bigbank control of #politics and more foreign #Wars. Vote #JillStein #GreenParty #Election2016
stay out of politics! I will no longer be using anything wired publicizes.
Why I'm voting for #Trump2016
Yes, Obama & Hillary's policies led directly to the rise of ISIS. This is manifestly provable recent history. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Cwma6l0HQ …
endorses optimism....lol...
The key to keeping politicians honest is an unbiased media, which this country does not have. Focus on science.
@donnabrazile Well said now we have to make it happen.
Wired not drinking the GOP and Trump koolaid. Good for them!
Your establishment media owner Condé Nast (who also own Reddit) push corrupt Hillary across all their sources.
Bye for good Wired!
I don't know why a tech magazine feels like it's a good idea to insert themselves into politics.
goodbye wired, the people don't support her.
So U endorsed someone who has not idea how 2 secure her own server! Has caused the worst refugee crises & financed by Saudi arabia.
why does anyone care what wired thinks? #unfollow
.@WIRED Good job endorsing @HillaryClinton.
@EricBoehlert @HillaryClinton You don't have to explain it. REALLY don't have to.
also the whole he's a racist, antisemitic, xenophobic pathological liar who can't be trusted w/ the nuclear codes thing prolly helped
most americans wish it didnt have to. #newleadership #shehadherchance #MakeAmericaGreatAgain She should be in prison
“@WIRED: Why WIRED has decided to endorse @HillaryClinton for president: http://bit.ly/2bgaGXX  ” INTERESTING
"Trump’s campaign started out like something from The Onion..."
she has to believe that she got us here !!!!
and I just unfollowed you and will never read anything you produce again. #fairandbalanced #shesacriminal
#liar for president?
Bye wired, it's been a long relationship but it's time to part ways.
all credibility lost

I was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me.  I am now 73....it never goes away.

so by "get better from here" you mean more of the same from the last decade?  Why would a tech rag need to endorse?
because of all the things she has done, that no one can ever name?
also need leaders that act on those beliefs as well and not just believe will that be the case is the big question.
@WIRED @HillaryClinton
bullshit.  Truth and integrity matters.
So Hillary can WIRE money to the middle East.
Oh wait, it was shipped. Maybe next time it will be "WIRED"
We're just not that into you or your "Sí hablo español!" VP anymore. @timkaine #ByeFelicia
you’re voting for trump ? You’ve lost a patron. Bye
shame
Guess what? You don't HAVE to endorse anyone. You are now a propaganda rag. Congrats.
well as an advertiser I will not support your publication anymore as you support a clearly corrupt individual to be our POTUS
Very disappointed. In the course of reading this article. I got cancer, it metastasized, and now im in hospice care.
you are delusional
(((imagine that))) another media sell out pushing (((the agenda))).  No big deal, you were irrelevant years ago.
Hillary is a blatant liar, crook, and the perfect example of a career politician that is destroying our country.
why get political?!  Stick to your bread and butter!  #sigh #facepalm #unfollow
things will get better for the rich but will screw the rest
endorses the most corrupt candidate for President ever, @HillaryClinton. Deserves prison, barred from any public office; people died.
looooooooool get cucked idiots
any attempt at 'journalism' is officially gone. You're back to being just a tech blog again.
Really? And you don't think @realDonaldTrump believes that? Hillary is a BIG part of the reason WHY things are so bad
blocked
Who cares? You, WIRED, are irrelevant!
gee, another media outlet endorsing democrats. Why media needs to endorse any political group is beyond me....bias?
#FuckWired #FuckHillary
Too bad your editors couldn't refrain from pushing their #politics, you just lost a formerly enthusiastic reader

Pandering to Oligarchy for pay to play.
Stay out of politics. Your readers don't care. I don't care.
cant get my media from a now clearly biased source #unfollow and #deletebookmark
#Cisco just axed 5,500 employees because of the "Free Marlet" Hillary and Bill have shepherded over 40 years.
#TPP
