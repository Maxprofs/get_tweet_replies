The Salvation Army does more
Prayers for all in need. I wish I can come and help!!
I tried to donate $1000.o in diapers to my local #RedCross. In Wichita Falls, TX but they wouldn't take them.

PRESIDENT TRUMP Helps HARVEY victims https://www.disasterassistance.gov/  obama Ignored SANDY victims
Red Cross is the worst charity to give to and to put here. Only 15% makes it to help, and they are wasteful. 6 figure salaries for leaders.
Please donate to THE RedCross nothing is too small #HoustonStrong
you want to donate check out @TzuChiUSA these people were amazing during hurricane sandy. Real help plus they hug everyone
Bon courage !
Thank you @RedCross
Since @meacuppa blocked me cause she doesn't want truth, here it is others & myself have said
I
Why so you can keep 80% like RED CROSS always does, just a little bit goes to those who need it the rest you keep
@Red Cross & @UnitedWay
We REMEMBER
Have your CEO donate her million dollar salary
How can I volunteer?
One should donate to some local Texas relief agency ensuring more of your money goes to help the needy and not administrative echelon.
Us Texans appreciate every help we get
Just donated 40 dollars feel really good

Thinking of you all! @atdaustin is here for @ATDSanAntonio !
You failed in 2005 w/Katrina, 2010 w/Haiti, 2012 w/Sandy & Isaac & in 2015 in Cali

People should find other organizations to donate to
Find another donation source.
I hvn't donated 2 ARC since wht they did 2 Haiti. Won't until they rectify Haiti AND become 100% transparent abt hw funds raised r applied.

Please change your policy to allow pets at your emergency shelters
There are shelters that allow pets in Houston.
They give a meal, cot, emotional support. ARC stopped giving big disaster victims $ after Katrina; beware; they direct  to other $ sources!
Apoyemos es una gran labor!!@CHAYANNEMUSIC @gentebonitaperu
You are great big and wonderful peopleGOD bless you
Mhm
Wonderful how they built 5 houses w $500M Haiti relief and stole Katrina money
Que gran labor, apoyemos!!! @gentebonitaperu
We love you Senator Warren. Keep up the good fight for us!
Dios los guarde  @gentebonitaperu
Local church opened doors as shelter but they need help w/ food, supplies, organization. Pecan Grove Baptist Church , Richmond
Can you help? @RedCross ?
Good luck and God bless those in need.
Thank you red cross its getting better over here but house are still ruin and the road are flooded
I'm thousands miles away but my is with the victims Harvey.

Homeland Security warns of cyber scams appearing to be Harvey relief requests http://hill.cm/PziKjO3  
Your phone's do not work, and held on phone over half hour. Cannot donate by phone or iPad. I need help to help
Dios bendiga tan hermosa labor.  bendiga y extienda su Mano Misericordiosa a cada persona afectada #RedCross #Chayanne #FamiliaUvitaPresente
I don't know, are you going to FUCK IT UP like you did with Sandy and Haiti?
@lalalouda
THANK YOU
Isn't Haiti still waiting for your help?
Red Cross take six figure paychecks, Salvation Army or some other charity.. Red Cross are all about themselves.. look it up
Thanks everyone I live hear and its crazy and my nease was one of the survivors bc there house was flooded to there chest and she is only 4
Go to Texas  #RedCross ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° people need help after Harvey
I donated $100 to @RedCross - and just requested corporate matching.  Thank you for taking care of the folks impacted by #Harvey.
$60 of that will go to high ups at Red Cross üñëüñë 
At least that means $140 is going to folks in need.  Please share what you are doing
Thought you said you donated  $100? By my math, that means $40 from your $100 is all victims will get! That's ok with you?
I donated $100 and requested company matching funds.  My company just announced that they are matching 2:1.  Math was $200 less the $60
I didn't see about your company matching.. however you're OK with someone taking a 6 figure salary & not giving to victims?
God bless you for charities.
Jesus tells what makes us unworthy for rapture.
Hampton Inn at 10505 East Freeway, Houston 77029 has taken in evacuees who flooded Deiday night, but have run out of provisions. Please help
Glad to hear. Evacuating a really big place like Houston is almost impossible.
Your churches have to rebuild and clean up also. They aren't going anywhere. It will be a long time before the effects are resolved.
In the 99 tornado and the other last big tornado the Baptist churches in Moore and Del City were wonderful. It will be along period.  OKC
Don't donate to RED CROSS!! Those $ going straight to the C.E.Os pocket.  No lie..Nola still hasn't been been helped.

They never even paid the drivers who brought loads there
Fema is full of shit what about katernia they fucked everyone on that deal they lie so much
Praying for Houston 
If you are a victim, remember, Trump says Mexico will eventually pay for the wall, and David Clarke's new book is somewhat readable.
Thank you, Red Cross for your unwavering help for storm victims across the U.S. Now for helping Texas.
Shelters were understaffed and not well equipped!
GUYS DONT BOTHER CALLING THEY DONT EVEN ANSWER
I am not seeing this on TV. Can you do this? 
I am concerned about elderly sitting in or near water not knowing what to do.
@uscoastguard 6314 laver love dr spring Texas 77379. Ask anyone. But a boat would be needed. My friend's dad is stuck upstairs. Emergency!
@RedCross 6314 laver love dr spring Texas 77379 Ask anyone.But a boat would be needed. My friend's dad is stuck upstairs. Emergency!
Call KTRK channel 13 or DPS for evacuation 911 only for health emergency!
Thank you, Eric!! I have family there and it is just horrible!
The #RedCross is #HopeInAction. Most of us can't help in #Houston, but they can. Help them to help others!
No. I'll choose a different option.
Will the money donated for #HurricaneHarvey go to the victims!?? Or to 6 figure salaries? Luxury hotels? #RedCross
 
@gentebonitaperu
the Red Cross has run into trouble for spending much less on disaster recovery than they collect,

All these typical Americans that won't listen make there own rules to ignore the honest professionals,cost millions more in grief  and money
We are Cambodian , we really need many help from American Red Cross

I would like to donate but live in Canada. Can you post the donation number for Canadians?
Thank you
Use form on their website for specific donation for #Harvey. Any other method goes to greatest need!
Kudos to you, Chayanne, for keeping us informed of the Red Cross & its humanitarian efforts.  I work with those who are in crisis. Thanks!!

How can we volunteer at shelters once water begins to recede, roads clear. We are blessed where we are and already made monetary donation.
.@RedCross is a bureaucratic scam. Donate elsewhere so those who need it can actually get the help they need
