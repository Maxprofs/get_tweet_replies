Thank you
Excellent! Thank you to Senator Gillibrand! Preserve Titke II and net neutrality!
Thanks for your support. Wish our CT @SenBlumenthal and @ChrisMurphyCT cared more about constituents than their cush jobs #NetNeutrality
So great you share your positions on important issues. So good to hear whether agree or not. Getting real sick of secrecy at #POTUS level.
That's good, but you have a few shitty colleagues that voted for him. They gotta be voted out and #PaiGottaDie (hope he gets cancer)
Thank you! I trust that you will work to persuade your fellow congresspersons to do the same! #netneutrality is vital
I’m a technologist and believe in information for the people! Thank you Senator!
Thank you for protecting #NetNeutrality
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you so much.... for being a disappointment
For opposing net neutrality?
Thank YOU! A MUST DO DEED! What does OUR Vote (& Finanical Institutions) MAtter IF its HACKED!?!
Kristen, your statement isn't exactly accurate. Net neutrality, like the ACA, isn't exactly what was promised.
Thank you, we agree. Will you please publicly call on other Senators to follow your lead?
Thank you Sen. Gillibrand
Thank you!!
TY. Yes, net neutrality is important.
thank you senator gilibrand!!! this is extremely inportant.
Thank you.
Could you also help with this?
Sen. Gillibrand for President!!
NOT!  It's easy to resist.  She has no ideas of her own and she's essentially a socialist. Ask Venezuela that doesn't work well
Thank you for fighting for everyday Americans Kristen.
Go to Venezuela your socialist ideas would fit well there. I mean they don't work but you would be among like minded people
Thank you!
Do you vote for anything?  Time for you to retire.
Imagine that?
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you Senator for fighting for us every day 
Have you voted yes on anything since President Trump took office
Thank you! The man is corrupt to his core and obviously in the pockets of ISPs
Do you support my President Trump think he more trade experience than you
Of course you're voting no...@SenSchumer gave you your orders
Thankyou, Senator:  this is a democracy issue, and the net neutrality allows us a voice!
Thanks Kirsten. Please think about testing the waters for the WH in 2020.
Thanks, Senator
You have absolutely no idea what your voting on - towing the Company line
Keep fighting the good fight! Thank you @SenGillibrand

@SenGillibrand Thank you! Net Neutrality is something everyone needs to be aware of!
Empty words from a liberal politician, they don't mean a thing..
if ur voting against it , it must be good for US
Thank you#
@JoyAnnReid why is there so little coverage about net neutrality? I would think it has far reaching implications.
Also, please push to see Trump’s taxes. Americans need to see how much he will personally benefit.
Thank you!
Thank you. This is an important issues to me.
Thank you Senator!
