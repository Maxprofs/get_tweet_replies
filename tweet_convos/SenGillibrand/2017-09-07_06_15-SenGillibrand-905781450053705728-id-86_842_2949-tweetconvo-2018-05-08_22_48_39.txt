Protect Dreamers? How about you start to protect Americans first! ICYMI  #JamielShaw
Time u stood up to protect #diesel #petrol vehicle owners Electricvehiclessuck #V8Forever Imagine battery size 4 hgv planes trains rockets?
Y'all are the reason shit like #HurricaneIrma keeps happening.
Lay off the sauce... lol One volcanic eruption emits more gases than all vehicles put together! #livingplanet here b 4 us & here after us!
Oh, and your PhD came from where?
Common sense dear! #common-sense! far to much #politicaltaxation by the #politicallycorrect with #agenda's instead of #financiallycorrect ?
Common sense is an endangered species in America. That is how we ended up with @realDonaldTrump.
Could have been far #worse imo... only time will tell? But #media wont make a dam bit of difference other than allow people to vent? #Likeus
??  Isn't it about time to obey the law. BHO stated that it was not constitutional and yet he did it anyway- AND he made it temporary.
You are Sworn to Uphold our Constitution! Protect it and America or do U.S. a favor and RESIGN! What Part of Illegal don't you Understand???
Or,....you in congress could do your jobs and write comprehensive immigration reform.
Glad to see your support for Dreamers. Now please co-sponsor S1615, the Dream Act
What about protecting the people who are here legally through tax reform.? The country has 300 million people let's not just focus on 800k
Why do you want to give the rich a bigger tax break while #dreamers contribute *B*ILLIONS annually via taxes?
You create mobs. And should focus on your own constituency. You trusted the wrong people, fostered identity politics, & watered down crime.
So you are saying that the thousands of #dreamers that live in her area don't matter? Are you more important?
Done!
Agreed. But we can call, march, donate, and show up for both. And more. We have to.
.@SenGillibrand. Thank you for ur support but why haven’t you cosponsored the DREAM Act yet? https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615/text …
Congress had 8 mos&has been given a 6 mos deadline.Barry circumvented the Constitution.DACA,with immigration,is up to the 17%favorables.
PROTECT LEGAL NEW YORKERS FIRST THEY NEED JOBS
Thx, @SenGillibrand! Spoke with ur lovely staffers yesterday AND sent u a fax AND will call u again tmrw! So appreciate ur DREAMer support!
Meanwhile, you haven't yet cosponsored S1615, the DREAM Act.
You can't help Dreamers until u stop illegal immigration. Otherwise we will have a continual DACA problem. Reform the system!
ObamaCare is a disaster, so much so that one architect has suggested single-payer. Just say NOOOO! Repeal & Replace please.
when u can provide free education food housing and medical for American kids that deserve it before any outsiders do Save $$ send them back!
Glad I don't need to call you - you're already on the right side. Thank you, Kirsten!
Build the wall then we will make them legal
Why not make calls to @HouseGOP to #impeach @POTUS already in violation of Constitution? 

#problemsolved 

#emoluments #conflictofinterest
Dreamers don't need protected, they are not legal citizens.  We are a country of LAWS, which you don't seem to understand miss senator.
When are you going to start worrying about legal citizens many of whom are minorities who are not working because an illegal has it.
Illegals should find path to becoming Legal Citizens and you do your job to provide that legal path Senator !!
I am calling on this.  I'm calling on @congressdotgov 2 do the job millions of Americans hired them 2 do & fix the mess Obama created 4 DACA
Where?
Dreamers are ILLEGALS. No more #DACA
Stop starting trouble, 6 months and a deal will be done. Your a politician you know the system.
Why?
You and other Dems should be screaming TREASON on every news show every hour.
Make calls? Thsnds of ur Delphi constituents tried that w/U  with 0 results. Ur team stole our pensions/healthcare & never looked back.
We will continue to hav problems with illegal immigration if we don't have control over our borders n stop with this sanctuary city madness
Thank you for all you do!
Tie it to must pass legislation. You have leverage. Use it. Protect the Dreamers.
you are my Senator, please do all you can to protect the dreamers
Run them out of the country ,they don't belong here .
nos movemos
@IndivisibleTeam If you have a smart phone, you can also contact your Senators using @botresist for calls, fax and actual letters.
I can't even begin to understand the point of calling on Matt Gaetz. My rep who is awful.
For folks making calls for the first time http://5calls.org  @make5calls makes it easy!
Who should we call #ghostbusters.? Your party doesn't care about the current USA children let alone #DACA. You're dreaming!
#defendDACA we are a nation of immigrants. #opentheborders
Please send them to the back of the line behind those already following the proper processes. They have taken our welfare, free college etc

Why don't you speak some truth about #DACA
Shame
If you are here illegally, pack your bags........
Reps should speak out to protect citizens, not squatters. #EndDaca
Both are unconstitutional -You created this with a lawless pres (Obama) and lazy congress - now do your jobs and fix it. Pres Trump did his
It is w u now in Congress.  What are calls going to do? Work w other side and get something passed. No more pointing fingers and excuses.
So will you be supporting @SenSanders #MedicareForAll bill?
#AmericansGirlsAlsoHaveDreams of
#NeverBeingForcedToLaborFor
#CriminalTrespassers
#TellCongress to
#EnforceTheBanOnInvoluntaryServitude
@CR
I'll speak as well. #DumpGillibrand. End #DACA and let's go #Trump2020.
Trump now says no action.  You Dems gave in on Harvey relief.  Totally feckless party. No more $$ from me to party.  Done. @SenSchumer
I stand with citizens and legal immigrants.  Not dreamers.
The people have spoken. It's up to you and your fellow Congress members now.
Call for both, they still have sights on healthcare.
Not beyond them to use dreamers to destroy healthcare
Healthcare is imploding. It was a Ponzi scheme from the start.  They never intended it to work. It was a a step towards single payer
what a dingbat this woman is.
You want citizenship for illegals we want a wall work out a deal that's your job or to quote you go the f*** home
Protect our borders. Reduce taxes. Make those calls too.
I really appreciate you as a senator, but why must the average people have to keep fighting your colleagues? You guys let this get this far
Got your healthcare right here.
I was able to speak personally to a staffer in both @SenSchumer and @RepEliotEngel 's offices. Why did I have to leave a message at yours?
Yes vote on a proper Dream Act.
I'm a proud NYer, thank you @SenGillibrand  @SenSchumer  and @AGSchneiderman !!
@SenGillibrand Kirsten Gillibrand, Why didn't you and Congress make DACA LAW OF THE LAND? Why do you want us to do all the work? DO YOUR JOB
All Americans are Dreamers. How about you speak out for them for a change?
Rights for all does not equate to less for one group. It's not pie.
Rights to break American law?
Seeing as how my wife just finished chemo 3 weeks ago today, and the news re McCain, I sure hope you don't mind if I call regarding *BOTH*.
Have to split our focus on DREAMers and shutting down Cassidy-Graham amendment that will wreck access to affordable healthcare.
.@ofa made it easy:
Even our 1st POTUS did this because he knew it was the right thing to do for America! He self term limited and gave up POWER! A great man.
Protect healthcare? My premiums are through the roof and a deductible that's higher then that. Should I be thanking you?
Only YOU/WE can fix healthcare: Demand Medicare for all!! Face down the LIARS who say it's too expensive or will end in "rationing".
Ms, a proud Dem here would like to know that congress is working on term limits  for themselves, 3-terms and out! No more lifelong pol.s!
We still must protect health care, too. I understand McCain is supporting Graham's plan to get rid of ACA.
It is already gone on its own accord
