Get rid of the superdelegates! People don't trust u either! That's why we have trump! Sick of both corrupt parties!
Need is systemic change?
Thank you Senator for speaking up!
We need you to do your job.
we are out here & we have speaking up since 09! Problem is u have ignored ur Delphi constituents after stealing their pension
From here in nj we support you in NY.  Thank you.
What does "out there" mean?
We speak up with our votes. The majority of those votes went your way so the onus is on you to good, hard work. #DoYourJob mandate in hand!
Things have changed and for the better! After 2018 elections and the @SenateDemocrats lose 8 more seats #MAGA will work
I wrote you but never heard back

I got my lighter...let's set shit on fire! -my follow-up quote. @sgaughen @SenGillibrand
@SenGillibrand Mar-A-Lago has most beautiful cake & u now have to pay 2x old membership fee to taste. He's profiting from office. #REMOVE45
Practice what you preach sister and start standing up for #dueprocess & fainess for ALL students 
#TitleIXforALL
How many Democrats voted against health care for all? No $$ in it for them either?!
Thank you @SenGillibrand for all of your votes and your integrity. NY you!
Isn't there a point where we must concede that this is simply a caricature of the system as it was designed to be and that what we really
Thanks senator, but most of what I say has to do with your uber liberal ideas 4 the gov 2 pay 4 everything, i.e. the VA is a great example.
What are you doing? Out where? Are you rallying people to the street? What's wrong w/you? You're an elected Sen. Pass a bill
While the republicans pass laws to arrest protesters?! The dems can't stick together to pass anything! Have trouble believing u all!
Thank you. And thanks to your kind and responsive staff when we call to "make sure" you're representing your constituents' interests
They aren't working that's for sure.
“Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not.” Dr. Seuss!
With you all the way! Remember look before you leap and say what you mean and mean what you say.
@Rabbit2426 We gotta work to get reed out of there  How they can make a showing in blue ny is beyond me

@CHCmobile if considering a pre run, you need to get beyond the fortune cookie tweets. We want substance from our leaders
Pre-run?? who?
presidential run. Papers say she's throwing her hat in the ring
America spoke up in elections all over the US in the last 8 years. Too bad so sad. Dems should come up with real ideas not obstruction.
.@ValuesandVoices has been speaking up & sending you & your colleagues letters for 88 days. Are you reading them?
Your just so boring.  You got to go!
Don't know how u do it, sister. I do activist meets, read Tenney's newsletter (ugh) march, phone. How do u deal with #resistancefatigue?
us being out there is no more or less important than knowing you're on the Forefront fighting for us! Resistance thanks you!
You always make these meaningless generic statements. 20 trillion in debt, ISIS, Syria, what's YOUR plan, besides trashing Trump?
Speak up. Exactly right. That's why 5 million men and women from all walks of life belong to the NRA. Supporting the entire Bill of Rights.
I'm out there working and I cannot wait until @POTUS gets another #SCOTUS pick.
@jennybethm
@cvpayne
@FoxBusiness
Give me my rights back
THANK YOU.  PROUD OF MY SENATOR.
I'm out here, supporting Trump 100%!
#Gillibrand2020
Dec of indep. Says we can abolish our gov and start new for our own safety. I purpose we the people do this now.
<3
And we need you to stop taking the corporate cash.
We WANT to get out there. But when I complained that Indivisible wasn't planning enough rallies, I was told to do it myself. We need help
We have rallies every Tuesday in Portland, Medford and other areas around the state. Pls DM us & let's see how we can collaborate.
I meant to say "marches" not "rallies." IMO only large marches have a national impact and serve to keep the inspirational fires going.
More mindless blather from the dumbest person in the @senate. I'm thinking of a parody account.
It will certainly help if we can flip the seats in all the special elections!

#FlipThe4th #Kansas #Thompson 

#FlipThe6th #Georgia #Ossoff

Thank you for what you do.
Proud to have you as my senator.
What is not going to be easy or quick? Out where??
@SenGillibrand Saturday 4/15. Bryant Park. 1pm. 45 SHOW US YOUR TAXES rally. Speaking up and making it count. #TrumpTaxReturns
Hope to see you at the #ScienceMarch on 4/22!
We tried in primaries but were silenced,marginalized,removed fr voter roles,not allowed to vote,vetoed by 'superdelegates'.#DNCisTheProblem
Thanks for your remarkable leadership. Pam
We keep speaking up
This would be motivational if I thought you were talking to your Republican constituents as well. 
Madam President has a nice ring to it.
@oufenix OK so will you boycott United Airlines?
WE WILL SPEAK WHEN GILLIBRAND IS UP FOR RE ELECTION THE PEOPLE WILL VOTE YOU OUT OBSTRUCTIONIST
Long Island is a mess with high taxes, drugs out of control and political corruption everywhere. LIRR is a nightmare and too expensive.

Looking for more suggestions on what to do as a NY resident.  Already writing senators...
While we're focused on big things , Reclaim NY is trying to do some nasty things. How can they be stopped??
Start with air travelers' rights.
We need you n the #Feminist man-haters out of office. I feel bad cuz you abuse your Sons. :(
hahaha thats cute. You dont need me out there. At least not for minor skirmishes.
Of course we do. We need everyone out there speaking up for what's right.
You dont know what you are asking for. You wouldnt like me when I get operational.
Vote.
