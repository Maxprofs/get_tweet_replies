As we mourn victims of yet another tragedy, time to finally act on commonsense gun safety reforms supported by the American people. #Enough
Let’s stop allowing would-be murderers to legally buy weapons of war like the AR-15. #Enough
Let’s keep those who have been deemed too dangerous to fly on an airplane from being allowed to buy guns. #Enough
Let's make our background check system more effective so we can prevent would-be terrorists from buying weapons of war. #Enough
Let’s lift the hold on the CDC & allow them to study gun deaths the way they study any other cause of death in this country. #Enough
Let’s crack down on #guntrafficking & finally make it a federal crime. I'm still waiting for a vote on my bill to #endguntrafficking #Enough
It's time to act! Let’s have a debate & then vote on legislation to make it harder for violent people to get their hands on weapons. #Enough
because all the laws in the world only stop law abiding citizens not the criminals who are the real problem
the only time the American people are safe is when you are not in session.
Because the Constitution prevents you from doing so.  Any other questions?   #billofrights
Moms w/ @MomsDemand  wonder the same thing. Thank you. We can't wait to vote. #Enough #Filibuster
