I will always fight to protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions & I'll work to block GOP efforts to repeal the #ACA.
Gillibrand...stop using this term 'women's health' NONSENSE, is there a 'men's health'? STOP IT, LUDICROUS
Of course there is men's health. Doctors can't help you if you don't get screenings though
We only need 'one' health program in US, just one, not gender specific programs, NONSENSE
Do you need pap smears, mammograms? Do you use hormonal birth control? Do you get pregnant?
NONSENSE: DO YOU NEED A PROSTATE EXAM, this is all covered under a proper medical program
Yes, under healthcare that is specific to what each patient needs - men, women, athletes...
One System is all that is needed. Go to med center they don't care man or women
women health is not = to Minority genocide, encouragement to promiscuity, lack of fatherhood & unsafe sex. Insurance should..
= racist
You really don't get it, do you?
Caroline, that was my reply to that comment from Carolina- see it? I get it on your side.
Aha I see it. My b. I'm new to twitter and there's a lot of hate floating around.
no, we need to remove you and all liberals from office until you change your ways
Thank you #IStandWithPP
@BlueTeam007 @KingsCountyPols we stand with you!! #RoeVWade #DNC
You voted for Nikki Haley, though... kind of cancels out your "beliefs" statement.
what did they think would happen putting "him" in office? #everyvotecounts,
phenomenal these last few weeks Senator. Keep it up. 
Thanks Kirsten for being the ONLY Senator to vote against all nominees. Keep it up!
No,  you must follow the will of the people you represent,  both those that agree with you and those that don't.

Thank you!

Fighting things that won't happen. Queen of wasting time.

you should know, neither the government nor your insurance pay for abortions in the US
Put up the proof, or shut up. Public record? Should be easy for you to produce.
