Does that mean no more Anchor babies 
As a "mother" and as a "nurse/medical administrator" you should have known better than that. I, as a child-free man, knew better than that. Shame on you for lying in your bio.
Yeah, she was never a Dem.
Justice sweetie , I once was blind but now I , maybe you should try  it instead of being led like a sheep 
Speak for yourself, sugar plum & while you're at it, take that log out of your eye.  You're tripping over it, honey bunny.
Does she think Americans never have times they need help? After my divorce MI Chip meant my son got treatment for asthma.
So yeah. Yay that children who need help may die. I'm sure that helps you sleep at night. It makes me sick to my stomach.
Notice in her profile she claims to be an hospice RN & medical admin.  I deeply pity the patients in her care.
It is a no brainer.... take care of your own kids.  Leave me alone.
Is there a petition for us to sign?
I saw that it did not get renewed. My children are on CHIP, what can I do?
ANOTHER HIT ON HRC
Just more proof the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump hate children.
Washington has ground to a complete halt. God help the USA.  Politicians seemed to have lost the ability to.
Well, we have a prez w/no brains! Some Congress Rs have stone cold hearts!
Wondering why #CHIP isn't trending?? 
Everyone who sees Sen Gillebrand's tweet should retweet
U and Obama Admin legalized bump stocks U gave 
Machine guns to crazies U have innocent blood on your hands u r NOT for gun contl Hypocrite
Thank you Senator! Listen up @lisamurkowski @SenJohnThune and every Republican who claims to support human life and dignity.
Is this no brainer on the shoulders of donald and the rep party!? Then it's probably doomed! He has no empathy for anyone
Are we done commenting on every one of Trump’s heartless antics? He is one. GOP in Congress are AWOL. Call out every single one of them!
Almost done.
Very good list. Also:
If it's a no brainer, it should be right up your alley.
still like this one
Hey @SenKamalaHarris and @SenFeinstein are you working on this?
The GOP has no brains so good luck
Can you find out why the Veterans' Outreach Center in Rochester, NY lost funding?
Because all of the VETs referred from the VA were denied services that they were eligible for, especially the Black ones. VOC is an awful racist place.
Is it true states won't begin to lose funding until November?
Perfect, because the GOP apparently has no brains.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Have you people (Republicans) NO heart, NO conscience, NO concern for anyone but rich people?
The same can be said for Democrats also.
CassKid: Not even close. Dems: the most inclusive party. Rich Repubs: Koch Bros., Sheldon Adleson, Mercers, Murdock, Friess, etc. Research?
Take a look at campaign contributions for HRC:
Rich Republs like I listed R trying 2 end regs 4 clean water & air, climate change, voting rights, & remove any watchdog orgs 4 corruption.
Trump is an oligarch, not a Republican.

#Perkins #studentloans program expires after block in #Senate by @SenAlexander fulfilling #Prediction http://jdcpredictions.blogspot.com/2017/10/sep3017-pertaining-to-debt-or-loan-and.html … 
AAAAANnnnnd, it expired. Now what? Congress never fails to disappoint.
Sadly nothing a ‘no brainer’ anymore with this Congress (or president)
Dems are equally complicit in destruction of this country. I am disgusted at your inaction this and a list of critical problems #deriliction
Why is it that since Republicans took control of Congress, the only things that get done are via their inactivity? They are NOT Serving any!
Just like our “president” - a no brainer.
The idea is to kill of poor, children first!
What are you going to do now? Sincerely, personally, I'm scared.
U can spend $, but u hinder economic growth by not supporting tax changes & Healthcare reform. #budgetbuster @realDonaldTrump @TonyPhyrillas
Send us clear simple description & guidelines on how to fight for this PRONTO
You're in luck. There's currently a massive surplus of no-brainers in D.C.
Thank you @SenGillibrand
One of them is mine. Because of the services he received for his ASD he is a college bound honor roll student & Eagle Scout. #CHIP works!
There shouldn't be a fight for this - it's 9m children. The senators who are complicit in this lapsing should be named and shamed.
How do you explain a "no brainer" to people with no brains? Many in GOP have no empathy or compassion.
So....nobody is there on a Sat night, right?  Did Congress act?  Nope.
This battle should have been taken up before last night @DNC. Now the program is gone. Where were you??

It expired
Want to quit ur job.   Click my link http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=133413 
Donald trump has no brain. Oh god...will he be able to sign his name and make this into law?
We’ve all benefited from CHIP are the phones going to  up or whatever???
how many tweets will @realDonaldTrump send out today over @nfl? 5? 10?  How many will he send out for CHIP?  I'm going with zero!
you would think that giving kids health insurance would be a universal idea...sad!
Since tRump's inauguration,  what has Congress done that was constructive rather than destructive?
That's the problem. They don't have any.
No GOP congressmen's children are affected, so why should they care? Plus children can't vote or donate to their campaigns.
Protect CHIP should be a no brainer but GOP needs to cut somewhere to fund Trump's tax cuts , GOP doesn't care about kids future !
They will have to check with the Koch's and Mercers first. Children apparently only matter when in the womb!
Unfortunately we have too many @GOP ers with no brains
#ProLife party my a**
#CHIP
How can we help you fight for CHIP? My daughter has wonderful care because of it. We can't lose it...
WE GET TO SEE THESE PAST 8 MONTHS- WHO THE GOP REALLY ARE!! PAY ATTENTION PPL!!
Rs and Trump dont care if Medicaid for kids expires. They are pushing it to the States. Less kids will be covered. Heartless!

There's other things to worry about Senator...Puerto Rico for one.
The Republicans want those children dead. It frees up more money for their tax cuts. #trump
Tax cuts for billionaires on the DEATHS of American children. Way to go #GOP. We will remember.
Well then we’re screwed because the @GOP and this WH have been working with no brains for over 8 months with nothing to show for it but crap
OK, so what DID Congress actually do today? Besides let CHIP funding run out and ignore 45's repulsive display of inhumanity re Puerto Rico?
GOP Senators are too busy thinking about tax cuts & NFL players protesting. No time for children, Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands.
Is there even a chance to save CHIP at this late hour?
#ImpeachTrump
This program  is so important!  Congress must protect the children
What is going on? These dollars are essential for the health and security of these young lives and their families. #CHIP helps everyone.
My niece and nephew have it... or we’ll, they did.  please fix it!!!
The only thing the @GOP likes more than watching brown people die is watching sick kids die. Vote better next time America.
No brains describes the @GOP precisely.
@MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump If @HillaryClinton had been elected president, the children would still be covered with CHIP.
If it’s a no-brainer it should be right up Trump’s alley
Sadly, a whole faction of them have no brains.
Please save our children's care! My daughter's Crohn's disease costs $120,000 annually, just my DEDUCTIBLE would bankrupt me without CHIP!
I'm sorry 4 you and many more. Worried 4 myself. Got letter saying no health coverage after 2018-pay $16,000yr. type 1 diabetic 29 years.
True, but I'm not sure most of the Republicans HAVE a brain.
Don't worry,  I'm sure @SusanSarandon will cover their expenses...
Dems instead of talking about it  how bad it is for PUERTO RICAN bring a $100 billion to $250 Billion AIDE and REBUILDING bill to congress
The kids ain't begging enough
Absolutely!'
For real
Should be is a HUGE problem for this administration.
What is a no brainer for the brainless?
It should be a no brainer I’m sure it will be a political football!
Ya think?
Please continue this essential program Congress! Children and their families need it.
CHIP is a term with NO meanung. Wouldn't known where to begin to help.
what's going to happen? Does trump care? No.
Temperamentally, intellectually& in terms of civic& moral imagination,trump is not fit 4 the duties he is now supposed 2 bear #ImpeachTrump
How does it even come to this?
If gop hadn't taken up so much time with Graham cassidy.......
They knew CHIP needed reauthorization. I reminded them
So did a lot of us. Gop took up a lot of time with Graham Cassidy
I called Mitch and my reps yesterday. They want it gone like ACA. We have to get them out!!
I called Mitch and all of my reps yesterday. Nothing. They want it gone, like healthcare
Could not get through to Ryan
HmmDidn't know this. There are some kids in my family that use CHIP. I'll have to pass this info along to see if their side of family knows
I was a single mom and used it!
Thank you for continuing to fight for US. How I so wish we had someone like you in the WH. #TruePatriot
@jessblatter unless you are looking for players kneeling before kick off tomorrow.
We can't let the GOP use these kid's insurance & hold them hostage for tax reform to funnel & redistribute our middle class money up to 1%.
No brainers describes most of GOP congress members
And dickless describes the GOP also!
Again I ask, @SenBobCasey, @SenToomey:  what are you doing about CHIP?
Republicans only care about fetuses, not children.
GOP: Sorry kids, gotta save the Kochs some more money. We'll get back to you.
Lets get in our time machines and go back to the 1980'S, and smack the hands of i surance CEO'S who collected huge bonuses.
Well, @GOP ave no brains. Or heart. Or soul.Sold 'em 2 Koch&Mercers, whatever was left traded4rubles #FakePOTUS #impeach45 #MuellerIsComing
Also deadline for RU/NK/IR sanctions is tomorrow.

So now @realDonaldTrump turns off Healthcare for kids....LOSER!!!
Another obsession with #HillaryClinton.
#GetOverYourself45 
#45MustGoNow
But it was a Hillary program, it must be destroyed.
20 years later, 8.9M kids covered. Children's Health Insurance Program (CHiP) part of Obamacare w/patient protection, guaranteed coverage.
The cacophony that is this administration drowned this out. Calling reps
How can they continue to so cavalier about peoples lives?
But they aren't Trump's kids so he dont give a shit and neither does the republicans.
Unfortunately the nobrainers are in charge.
Don't count on it. Unless Republican kids are on it they DONT GIVE A FUCK.
Just add it to the list of failures from Trump and GOP
No brained? How would u know.
GOP doesnt care about anyone.  we're fucked.
Where did you get this number from it couldn't be the GAO they've been wrong all along Thursday no way that that there's many
Bot
Although congress does not meet again till Tuesday
Yeah, didn’t you get the memo? The GOP isnt interested in helping ANYONE that isn’t already rich, corrupt, male, and white
Should be but we are talk the USA GOVERNMENT
Children are not a priority for @SpeakerRyan or @SenateMajLdr
Sure.My insurance is up 26.5% this year.  Keep taxing me into poverty, then I get everything free.
This should be a States issue. Keep the Feds out of it.
@TenthAmendment
No it should not. All the states would do something different and it would be a mess
You just don't understand Trump voters, they don't care.
Thank you for protecting our children!
It's CHP but agreed
Problem: CHIP expires tonight and Congress is away.  But thank you,  Senator.
GOP is the no-brainer party.  Collegiality must be tough.
Well, that (no brainer) would seem to fit this administration but don't take anything for granted with this unqualified group
Unfortunately, no brainers are all they can handle
poor children? yeah I'm sure the GOP will get right on that.. NOT
Not gonna happen. Beat the Republicans over the head with their cruelty.
Children before Politics
He wants these kids to die. Hitler went after the disabled first. Republicans: Pleased to meet you. Don't forget my name  Love, Lucifer.
Congress says "Let 'em die!"
For those with brains that is.
I'm sure the pro-life @GOP is rallying to get this done! They are the party of family values, in that they measure the value ($) of a family
Thankfully we can all count on @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris but @RepMimiWalters is home, having coffee in Issa's district.
@POTUS golfing will kids get their insurance pulled
Agreed I no brainer like enforcing the law and departing illegals
Please save CHIP. How can we say we are a great society if we can't provide basic healthcare for children?
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN - THIS IS HOW- RIGHT GOP!!??
Thank you for your fight, Senator. You have my vote always.
They overlooked this important legislation while @realDonaldTrump busily mocked and bullied citizens #shameonthem #HealthCareForAll
You didn't count on your fellow Senators having no brains, be ready for anything...
We need CHIP. #TrumpSupporters want us to save babies  but we need CHIP to save the babies. #MAGA
For once I side with the left on this
Welcome Spook! Kick back, relax, #Resist and enjoy!
The senate and the house missed the deadline to reauthorize - putting millions of children's lives at stake. Unacceptable.
Missed? More like allowed to expire on purpose.
I would say I'd call my representatives, but you are one of my reps, so .  Guess I can remind Suozzi. Anyway, thanks for all you do.
How is this happening? Almost forgot...McConnell and Ryan et al.
Yes
Not really since congress is full of sociopathic grifters who think sick kids are a line item in a budget
Please have the guts to tell me Y U want the government to do everything for everyone?  I really want to hear.
Can CHIP still be approved after 9/30 with >60 votes or does it have to be during reconciliation?
It is a no-brainer. The no-brainers of Congress will let this expire.
Isn’t it obvious that @SpeakerRyan Congress careless about CHIP and children? They are VILE creatures of subhumans.
We the people ALREADY voted to end wealth redistribution. We will NO longer give healthcare to Illegal aliens while our Vets die on street
What the heck is going ON?
Senator, he continues to sow division and uses destructive rhetoric against American citizens. #CensureTrump
Yeah but these guys have no brains, and worse, no heart. Fight Senator!!
As luck would have it, the majority of Congress has no brains.
Bless her but Sen Gillibrand served us a long there.
Mr President has a different chip on his mind this weekend, unfortunately.
The GOP will gladly make children suffer. #Resist
Saving #PuertoRico should be a no brainer too but ...
Trump immediately signed auth for aid & FEMA to PR. Then he apoointed a General to organize efforts in Puerto Rico. Trump has done great job
When Katrina hit, local mayors hired locals immediately to clear the debris from roads. Mayor of PR organized NOTHING
The#GOP had no brain. A good fit
Renew CHIP NOW. Lives are at stake.
Sister Kirsten, Cash Jesus said let those without insurance be hit with a bag of stones. Blessed are the Rich!
Need to add a few emojis , to let the dim witted #Flaky45 Followers know you're being sarcastic.
Disn't sound sarcastic to me. sounds perfectly accurate.
Little known fact: before jesus would heal ANYBODY he required them to prove they had insurance. The Roman Centurion needed a valid passport
