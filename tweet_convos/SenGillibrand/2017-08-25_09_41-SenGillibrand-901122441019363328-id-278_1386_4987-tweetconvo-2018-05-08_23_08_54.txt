Lololol keep waiting
I'm running for town council in Huntington! Read Off The Sidelines right after I received the designation. I'm @EmilyRogan4HTC @EmilyRogan
And when you ask her, send her our way -->>
I am a Dem looking at running for a GOP held state office in NY.  I am interested.
Thanks for your interest in running for office @Shuana_weexist! We can help you- just head to
This Nation needs more women to take decision.
Okay @HillaryClinton @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris please announce a run for 2020, any day now:)
Gillibrand 2020. Biden could put Harris on ticket. Please Clinton do not run
I'd rather vote for a man who had great ideas then a woman who had shit ideas. There is no place for sexism in this world.
Great candidate in Bethlehem! @pmiwanowicz @enckj
I know one scientist thinking about running! @trish_zornio for Sen in Colorado 2020. Please follow her!
Thanks! @SenGillibrand I would be honored to talk should you be willing. I'm exploring U.S. Senate CO 2020 (Gardner). #electascientist
Why is that a problem if the men earned their position? Stop using your vagina as a campaign slogan. What are your thoughts on real issues?
Yes! @SarahPalinUSA
I know a strong, smart, female scientist that's considering a run in CO! @trish_zornio - follow her! @500womensci
Thanks Wendy! I hope @SenGillibrand can hear our tweets! 
Hey, if Kid Rock?? Why not someone whose actual job is critiquing policy?
@iamsambee @FullFrontalSamB #senategiants
In just one week, @LifeAfterHate has gotten halfway to its goal. Let’s get them the rest of the way. https://twitter.com/FullFrontalSamB/status/897203801614057474 …
@laurenchivee run please.
Still waiting on u to pop the question....
Nicole Malliotakis is running for Mayor. As an UES constituent I urge you to endorse her.
@Holly Gordon @susanmcph
I know a woman who should leave office. Representing this country does not depend on skirts/pants, it depends on qualificatns & sound thkng!
Has anyone else noticed that T does not have a deaf interpreter when he addresses America?

HOW ABOUT YOU? PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 2020?
No
Hillary...I still want her to be President.
Why?
I have Senator, my sister. Perhaps a call or card from you could help push it forward.
Hi
You should run for president in 2020!
Especially if she is a Republican!!! 
Why does it have to be a woman? Why not just a good candidate?
SEXIST!
Just as long as you run in 2018 @SenGillibrand one of the giant women of the Senate and my Senator.
Do it, @rmcgrudiva 
Oh, wow!

Damn. My twitter address & Gillibrands & that gif altogether in one tweet. Comb Over you ROCK.
A few I can think of. @LonnieRhea @marybethpf @PhyllisMervine
Aww. Thanks Michele. My sister-in-law ran for council last year. Gives me hope. @SenGillibrand @marybethpf @PhyllisMervine
I know one.  She retweeted you and is listed after you on the replying to list above.
Even conservative ones?
Yes Me as a Republican to stop the democRATS corruption!
How about the BEST person rather than a woman or a colored person or a transgender person?  That's what's wrong with America and politics
I know one who has! @ElaineDiMasi for NY-1!
I do and she is! Her name is Dr. Hiral @hiral4congress & she's running to unseat @RepTrentFranks in Arizona
Please contribute & support her!
I've thought about it.  Not sure where to start.
Chelsea Clinton
Chelsea Clinton.
@IngrahamAngle she would be better than anyone else! Ms Ingraham take the plunge!
Oprah￼
Nikki Haley, Mia Love, Karen Handel...   Did you support any of these strong, intelligent women?
Trumps daughter would make a great senator
@area0303 mom you should run!
I did! And she's running for Congress against Dave Reichert in WA-8! Check out http://drkimschrier.com  & show her some love!
Yes! And then be her first donor and her first volunteer.
I am hoping that those running get solidarity and support like speaking invites. Especially those rejecting lobby $s like @kathieallenmd
It is time for women to clean the House, of Congress that is! Only 20% of U.S.Congress is women. May they gear up for 2018!
U R a beacon senator
As long as her name isn't Hillary Evil Clinton have at it
@DrCSWilliam I know a powerful & brave woman who did just that! @HeatherforAZ just changed life from health care to politics!
The problem is, we need liberals living in red States
I'll vote for you Kirsten.
Why not Zenia? Y'know-daddy's one-time tart?  Smarter than you, tougher than you and unlike your gilded rise, up from her bootstraps.
Can't believe I'm saying this but especially Repub women. The few GOP senators with any semblance of a conscience are primarily women.
Extremely needed
Yes!! Liberal hate and bigotry and intolerance is giving rise to a new wave of conservative women ready and able to run for office!!!
@amyklobuchar #amyforpresident
Not you.  You support BDS
More women will hopefully consider it.
Do you know a person...
Soon as that person files legally...give that person..and bring sources of financial support Words & solid back up
I would run in a second if I knew how to get started.
I want to I just don't know what to run for. Senate?
Shout-out to @erinvilardi of @voterunlead, an organization that trains women of all political persuasions to run for office. Check it out!
Ok I'm asking you to run for president. Form exploratory committee. It puts u out there preempt Cuomo, warren, clinton, Biden, Harris etc
The thought of constantly having to raise money is just daunting. What's the solution?
I don't know you personally but you're my senator. SO, Senator Gillibrand will you please  enter the race for 2020? 
My good friend is running for county judge in a county that has NEVER elected a Dem judge (Delaware County, PA). She could use your help!
Feel free to make a donation at
My wife @ShawnaBlack17 is already running!
But you Senator Kirsten Gillibrand always care my situation. Thank you.
I support an activity of the woman politician. But whether woman or man politician, they must not undermine morale of their supporters.
I'm running for mayor of the City of Cortland
@pallmendinger

I know a few who should run from their offices. That would be any female working in the WH.
I don't know if I should, but I'd like to one day.
How about you, Kirsten?  I also like Rep. Val Demimgs--very presidential.
How's impeachment coming?
Would love to, but live in a completely red town and mostly red county.  :(
I did. I won.
Where do I begin?
@kriswaldherr Hmmm?
This racist, homophobic, misogynistic, narcissistic Nazi in the WH must be REMOVED #ImpeachDonaldTrump
Umm, hey Kristen, have you ever considered running for President? Just asking. Today.

#Resist
Hmmm. Seems like that should be you Kirsten.
 ehhhhhh no but love you anyways 
I heard Ayaan Hirsi Ali may run for your seat. You ok with that? Will you cheer her on? LOL
Hillary Clinton won't go away.
Look at the Seattle's mayoral race. A woman for mayor once about a 100 years ago. The top 4 candidates for mayor in 2017: all women.
@HillaryClinton #Hillary2020
Not all women are good candidates. @RepMcSally is agreat prime example.
I've asked her. She's a Republican who would run against a democratic incumbent. Here's hoping.
If I had ANY idea how to even get started, I would run...
Kristen for President 2020. 
Senator Gillibrand please run for president
I tell my wife everyday to run against Russia luvin' Dana Rohrbacher...
Then tell her 2 apply 2 @EmergeAmerica. When  run win same rate as men. Our alums win 70% of races, even red states, doubles your success!
No worries @SenWarren aka @ElizabethForMa is waiting the bullpen preping 4 2020 in case @BernieSanders somehow doesn't run. #TyTLive
We did. And when they all said no, @mdevitojr felt he had to run for Congress. Yes to more women! But yes FROM women too!
#LetsRunTogether
I'll support any Dem woman who supported Hillary.
So many! RBG's "when there are nine" quote comes to mind, too.
How about you put your name in the running for 2020.
@Dorothy410berry ?
@PoonamGi11!!
Please support @MikieSherrill, a former Navy pilot/federal prosecutor & mother of 4, in her bid to flip NJ's 11th and defeat @USRepRodney!!
Me
I don't care one iota if it is a man or woman-just get this nutcase out and Democrats get their shit together
Would love to run but can't afford to stop working to campaign #hatchact
Plunge? Perfect word! Right into your swamp!
You for president, Senator.
@SP_Squared, this has your name written all over it.
If you want to run check out @VoteRunLead and take their webinar for help getting started.
What about people of color? People with disabilities? LGBTQ? Of different religious background?
What about a transgender person should we ask them. Why should we be asking just females are you bigoted?
Ok we want Gillibrand2020 for POTUS
Kirsten Gillibrand will you run?
YOU! Gillibrand 2020!
Sally Yates
I will. Skeletons in closet but I am human
You,Kristen. Run for President!
How about those who shouldn't run, can we ask them not to?  @HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris @DWStweets Please go away.
Also: women, don't wait for someone to ask you! You can do it.
How about you?
Jackie Ceonzo
Yes, anyone but you!
Kirsten, would you please run for office?  You fit in nicely in an oval shaped one! 
Ok I will bite . I will gladly support you or your fellow Dem Senators Liz and Kamala in 2020 for President.
Please run for President
ahhh...........NO! not unless it is Ivanka Trump running!!!
Definitely need more!!!
Why are you such a sexist?
Actually I did. And she won. Congresswoman Tenney. Will you celebrate her success or does she not count to you?
Ok. Senator Gillibrand, millions of Americans believe that the Democratic Party needs your voice and leadership at the top of its ticket.
Millions is stretching it... she is a far left kook that prosecutes innocent servicemen accused of sexual assault.  EVIDENCE OPTIONAL
You
Ok asking  you to take the plunge run for president 2020
how about you for President in 2020? @Tulsi Gabbard as VP!#ShePersisted  #NastyWomenWeek
I am not independently wealthy and therefore running for office is out of reach.
PLEASE, run
please run 
Please @SenKamalaHarris @KamalaHarris run for president.
Yes! After Trump is finished with his second term, it'd be nice to see a Republican woman in office!
Are taking the plunge for the presidency in 2020?
Will you run for president then?
@mansiesq
I wrote this article about the Democratic Party, and I'm a woman that would run. What do you think?
Do we really care about gender still? I want the best people regardless of gender.
We love you, @SenGillibrand! Time to close the gender gap in US politics and gov't.
Yes, she is very conservative and I am trying to encourage her to run against you for Senator because you are such a pathetic Rep of NYS.
YOU! YOU SHOULD RUN FOR PRES!
I would love to if I had the courage.
Please run, Kirsten, I'll vote for you
Emily's List is reporting upward of 16K women who've contacted them re interest in running. We NEED more women in office!
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for President, 2020.
There are a lot of women that are more than qualified for office and most are conservatives
Any of of the woman republican or democrat in the Senate it's time to get rid of male chauvinism. Even Jesus had to have a mother
@rareblackbirds 

What about you :)
@amyklobuchar please run for President in 2020
Two brave and amazing women are running here in #NJ @LaceyRzeszowski for State Assembly and Beth Little for At Large #Summit Town Council.
Do it!!
Me?
I'm thinking about starting small and going for my local city council? Advice?
Read "Every Day is Election Day"
Start going to meetings.
I don't care what the gender of the candidate is...as long as it's NOT a republican!
Happy Friday, @lisabari. :)
Someone please run against #DumpGillibrand hopefully the #GOP can find us a winner.
Please run for president 2020!
Shouldn't she need more qualifications than just being a woman? What a ridiculous statement!!
You should run for president
#Kristen4Prez2020
And @runforsomething will be there to help.
Julia Peacock, @PeacockCongress, is running against @KenCalvert in California's 42nd congressional district. Please RT your support!
I know of one, but she's currently in the path of Hurricane Harvey.  Once it's clear, I'll ask her again.
We have a fabulous woman running for County Executive in Rockland County. @MPorette Maureen Porette. Please send some support! @rocklanddems
@Chelie44 @SenGillibrand and @SenKamalaHarris should run in 2020. We've had enough white men screw this country over

Wow!way to show you're a biggot!it should be the PERSON most qualified!way to continue the great divide Obama started!
They are all exhausted by House and Senate doing nothing.
Do you know a woman who shouldn't take the plunge and run for office? Ask her not to run. Ask her today. Please don't run again
Sorry but there isn't a woman Democrat I can think of qualified to run.
Is gender malleable?
Uh, ok. 

Sen. Gillibrand, will you run in 2020 for POTUS?
A bit sexist.. ya think
What if she is is pro life?
ok, I'm asking you to run for President.
@MichelleObama already said she wouldn't run. Lol. I miss them dearly
More women are needed in POLITICS....
The future is female!
I want you to run for Senate against Jeff Flake or Kelli Ward. Or whoever Trump thinks can win.
I think we'd rather keep her as our senator from NY. Call me selfish.
It's time for her to move. Please. I will trade two for one
I sense I would probably personally *like* Mr. Flake, but I'd never want him as my senator. Send him here if he agrees to resign. :)
Who can they reach out to for help getting started?
Yes, my wife. She's amazing.
Run!!
