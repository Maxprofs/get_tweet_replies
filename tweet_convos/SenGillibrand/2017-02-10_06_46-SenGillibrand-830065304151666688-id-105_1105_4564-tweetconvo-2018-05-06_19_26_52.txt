Today I’m introducing my first bill to Congress, the Access to Legal Counsel Act. 
http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/Sen-Harris-1st-bill-seeks-legal-counsel-for-10918943.php …
disgusting that such a bill needs to be drafted.

Those refugees survived Assad's genocide. They deserve safety & comfort
Will you support them and let them crash at your pad?  Didn't think so! Let's take care of OUR citizens...
Steve, stop it. Never have Republicans ever taken care of American citizens.
You want get rid of ACA,  Medicare,  Medicaid, & Social Security. The blatant hypocrisy and lies are so fucking disgusting
Melania Trump is costing us $500,000 a day and not a peep from Republicans about that bullshit, so don't  try and fool me
you elected a man who is getting rid of the Dodd-Frank Act. That's not taken care of Americans that's taking care of the  1%
I didn't vote for Trump...please save your liberal attacks for blocking streets and riots..thanks babe!
So you try to demonize 3 million ppl for the actions of 30 That's .o1%
Pretty illogical.  But anti intellectualism is rampant
why are you more concerned about immigrants than your own constituents. THAT is patently obvious.
they represent NY and CA -a large percentage of their constituents are immigrants.
the ILLEGAL ones are not constituents. why are they more important than you?
they're family of legal immigrants. And important to me everyone is treated w/due process.
Thanks to you both for your courage & intelligence. Proud to be Gillibrand's constituent. The future is female!
Your sexism sickens me........please do something about yourself...
Dude, you have 38 followers! Work on that.
Great come back!!!
I really want to see one or both of you on the ticket in 2020. This is the time for leadership and action.
she will loose just like Killary
@caroljdavy @KamalaHarris New CA senator off to fast start to being even more idiotic, misguided, wasteful than predecessor!
shouldn't they be working on the budget in that hell pit with $10 gas??
Who pays for this legal counsel?  Is it offered Pro-bono?
@SFGate You do realize noncitizens have no Constitutional rights, right?  Liberals love wasting taxpayer money!
So you think non citizens have no Constitutional rights? Ever read the 14th amendment?
proud of you ladies. keep up the good work!
@SFGate Thank you.
excellent. And there are lots of lawyers like myself willing to volunteer to help out.
you you should take the refugees in your house, since you are so helpful
.@dajulca01 @findianajones @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris you you should take the human beings in your house, since you are so helpful
Maybe you should ask the American taxpayers if that's what they want . Not just the Democratic Party.nt my dime
how many illegals are living with you woman or is this u spitting out bs again?
Gillbrand and Harris ticket, 2020!  @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris
Thank you both.
@chris63414391 @KamalaHarris how about  legal counsel for citizens who were victims  of illegals???
good luck
Thank you so much for all you are both doing!!!!!
do your job and protect Americans first, such demo crap, vote DEms out
They are not Citizens and have no RIGHT to taxpayer paid legal council.
@chris63414391 @KamalaHarris you should pass a bill for a pony too.
thank you for upholding US values!!
Welcome Senator.  Unfortunately, our POTUS needs a leash.  Protect our Constitutional Democracy- he's unstable.
We don't want them, and you want us to pay legal fees? You are crazy!
@mrs__peel @KamalaHarris #DREAMTEAM
#Gillibrand2020

and why no free legal counsel for women who are victims of family violence?
are you paying for that personally then that would be a nice thing!
Thank You, Ladies! 
Thank you!   The hard-working, tax-paying voting citizens thank you for offering our money!!!!!!!
Who is going to pay for this counsel? Pro Bono?!  How about we take care of the veterans in country before them
Thank you for sponsoring this bill!
thank you both for your principled leadership!
Thank you both.
Amazing that you and Chuck care more about refugees and immagants than citizens living in poverty here!
So nice you do so much for non citizens when I came back from Iraq the VA just wanted to kick me to the curb
and whose pockets might you be picking for this grand scheme.
Love seeing @SenateDems working together for We the People! Thanks @KamalaHarris @SenGillibrand
@SFGate 
who pays for this, Senator? 20 trillion in debt...
@PattyArquette @KamalaHarris grateful for both these strong intelligent compassionate women Senators!
#ShePersisted
When will someone help us with student loan interest which is too high?
You matter sir because you are a male and that doesn't fit into her female only agenda..
@PattyArquette @KamalaHarris    Proud that you're MY SENATOR!!!
good luck
Let us know and I'll call my senators
Proud of my @SenGillibrand @WajahatAli @KamalaHarris
@PattyArquette @KamalaHarris Good Luck
Go Kirsten, go Kamala, we need more like you!!
Representing non citizens!!  How about taking care of Americans first more importantly VETS
OUTSTANDING!!!
great! Now taxpayers have to pay for lawyers for terrorist! Isn't that what the ACLU does?
you both rock, thank you!
keep fighting for us
@CaliforniaJazz @KamalaHarris we love Kirsten! 
Is this part of your job description to provide legal counsel to people?
Please investigate this. Ordinary men did cruel things. This is how it starts.
and just when did you bother to even consider the thoughts of your constituents?
You two should team up for 2020'!
If they can pay for it, that's fine. I DO NOT WANT MY TAX DOLLARS BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. Are you crazy?
 & thanks, Senators!!! You make us proud.
@SFGate thank you, Senators!!!
@SFGate Thank U Senators!  #TheFutureisFemale
precisely why he will get the job.
always thought you were weak, but you proved me wrong by being the most courageous in the Senate @KamalaHarris
@TyroneGayle @KamalaHarris i don't like Trump's ban, I hate it cause I hate stupid things, but this also is stupid
@cloud_swatch The future of the Left in the U.S.!! Sen. Gillibrand is an inspiration!
Thank you, senator Gillibrand. You're making me very proud that you represent my family in the senate.
Thank you both!
You guys are rockstars. GO GO GO. We're behind you!!!
Thank you both! Please continue to be the leaders we need, encourage your colleagues to have your moral courage
Good thing the Senate and the House majorities are Republicans. It will not pass! Anyone need toilet paper???
this is huge. Thank you. #Neverthelessshepersisted #NoWallNoBan
THANK YOU!  Please don't stop, and don't back down! #Neverthelessshepersisted #resist #noban #realPatriots
not super interested in anything less than impeachment and removal...
Disgraceful! You keep spending tax payers hard earned dollars on everyone but Americans in need. Stop it now!!!
Inassume the attorney will be working pro bono?  I'm certainly not payin for it
Isn't that the job of their own country's consulate in the US?
Thank you!
I signed it too as a citizen co-sponsor!! YOU NASTY WOMEN!  http://go.kamalaharris.org/page/s/access-to-legal-counsel-act?source=em170209-b …
Thank you from Jefferson County NY.
Boooo!
You're getting voted against next election for this bullshit bill.  We have no reason to waste money on this.
I think I'm gonna turn on notifications for your tweets & tweet you "please run for president in 2020" every time you tweet
do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to spend my taxes?
investigate Flynn.
Thank you !
You all make me incredibly proud.  :-)
women leading in the Senate. I love it!!!
