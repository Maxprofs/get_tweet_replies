I spoke out about @SenatorSessions – until @SenateMajLdr McConnell decided to silence me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVyq6kAN6u4 …
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Maybe if you quit acting like petulant children...
I strongly condemn inappropriate use of Rule XIX (19) against Elizabeth Warren to steamroll the opposition to Sessions!  
So was not voting for Mattis.

@SenWarren @SenateMajLdr Another Democrat who doesn't know the Rule. #LetLizSpeak My Senators from NY are such children.
@starwood2000 @SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr
It's 2017, not 2009.
#MAGA
What are you going to do? We the People Are Looking for Bold Actions. Not Just Words. #Resist
what are you #Resist ing? The government working together to help our citizens? To fight positive changes? Smart
your right, Eliz Warrens actions are outrageous. I personally think that she is mentally ill (look at her actions!)
kudos to R for knowing the rules.  Not surprised Ds didn't. #rulesmatter #yesevenantiquatedones #dumbocrats
How about Every Dem read the Fucking Letter for CSK!?!?!
although by doing that, she did get 4 million live views on FB, way more of the gen public heard her (Silver lining?)
Perfect. 4 million people were able to hear how crazy she is. #letlizspeak
we women are being strip of rights let her speak
Ohhhhhh so it's "The He-man Woman Haters Club"...ok gotcha! Wouldn't want anyone thinking we'd moved past misogynistic rules.
we need to continue to tell the true facts and protect freedom of speech. Continue fighting for the truth
It is outrageous.  Dems need to continue to stand up and do what is right.
Elections have consequences.
- Yes, not following the rules is outrageous. But laws and rules don't apply to angry liberals.
this is unamerican 
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube Nothing like a room full of men silencing women drives me to polls faster.
Keep working hard ladies, we support you!  
#LetLizSpeak
ok but what is the political move being made? its uncalculated - why @SenWarren? is GOP banking on misogyny?
their tired of the propaganda and hate the dems are pushing to fatten their pockets. #bequietliz #followrulesliz
no womens rights why do we always have to fight with the male ego can't we just be heard men are nothing with out women
so you agree that personal attacks on fellow members is good?
the way you politicos act makes me want to vote all you supposed repressive state of the public out & start fresh#growthefup
female senators are not school girls. The senate is not a church. Senators are not required to be silenced by bigots.
it is when r u hosting a town hall meeting
And it sure didn't work. McConnell couldn't have magnified Warren & King's voices louder if he'd tried. #ShePersisted
Oh no!It's another #Libtard with her panties wedged up her ass! Everyone get ready I feel another pussy hat protest coming! 
We stand at ready!  He just elevated the 2020 Presidentsk
"Nevertheless, she persisted"
totally agree!  Women will not be silenced!
It is an outrage, but it had a significant backlash as people downloaded & read the letter. It is being absorbed word by word
@ammboston The up side of McConnel telling Warren to shut up & sit down is that he didn't grab her
@ammboston Essentially, McConnell told Warren to shut up and sit down. How many women have heard that before?
Yet a man can read it aloud later?
no it's not. She broke rules.
Outrageously Awesome!!
You are a hero. Thank you.We will all persist.
I agree!!! Unacceptable.
Make the bastards go nuclear regarding Gorsuch!
Please do something, Sen. Gillibrand. It is not enough to Tweet your outrage. Stand tall, stand firm, let's save our country.
Senate marginalized the end of the republic transition to imperial state
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube A violation of Warren's first amendment rights and a breach of protocol.
we are allowing them to lead us like sheep to the slaughterhouse!
freedom of speech being denied on the Hill? Troubling times. Alt facts and alt behaviours taking over DC.
you got schooled by Mattis and HAD to vote against him.  Can't you just rise above the partisan games?  #tcot
So Senate rules don't apply to Sen Warren in your opinion? Let me guess, the rules only apply to those with whom you disagree
Buy yourself a 'Rules of Order' handbook. Heck, you can probably pick one up for free in the hallowed halls of Congress.
Why isn't every Dem senator getting up on the Senate floor and attempting to read Mrs King's letter?
What's outrageous is the lack of decorum and decency your party is showing! In life there are rules! Even if your a Democrat!
#StopTheCoup
, you tell'em. #LetLizSpeak
- this is what winning looks like!!

they would have never silenced a fellow male
outrage is a good start.
thank you for supporting @SenWarren and opposing Sessions.
UNCONSCIONABLE on McConnell's part.
This is not a democracy.  Outrageous that you and Sen. Warren are being silenced!!
never be silent. #resist
@SenWarren We are behind you! Lst hurrah of the OLD BOYS CLUB! Underestimating us #NASTYWOMEN- nvr SMART.. your days are #'ed
PS thank you for your no votes on Trump's nominees.  I'm a proud and appreciative NY'er.
so why didnt other Senators pick up her speech where she was so rudely ejected? #letlizspeak
Dems need to voice alternatives and action, not outrage.  In Trumps America, outrage is a given.
I wish Dems would stop calling things "outrageous."  It's become a cliche sounds like talk w/o action.
Warren chose to break specific rules about the nature of speech allowed on floor. Rewrite rules for her?
follow the RULES....she broke the RULE you don't reward someone who breaks the RULES! Start reading the RULES....
Rules apply to only Republicans, amirite?
Stand up for your colleague!  Stand up to the Repugnants! We must all stand up to these evil people!
Warren did this intentionally to stir up the left. She should be ashamed but as one who lied about their heritage, NO.
where are your tweets to stick up for the conservative voices on college campuses? Hypocrisy abounds
yes how dare there be rules on the senate floor. #letPocahontasspeak
I would say the same. Outrageous! #XIForAll #DueProcessForAll #YouSayYouDo #Where?ProveIt
@MattAsherS  @McConnellPress and the @gop followed #TrumpTheAssHole what do you expect from them?
But a man got to read the same letter?  What century is McConnell living in anyway?
Rules don't apply to Democrats amirite?
I am proud of her. Keep persisting.
The last senator should read it twice, the second time to restore @SenWarren’s voice.
What should happen is that every Dem. Senator stands up and reads that letter, then votes “no”.
I agree. Let her speak. Let the whole world enjoy her kookiness.
mcconnell is following in trumps footsteps- right behind russia
every dem senator should read that letter in senate after a long speech about sessions disqualifications.
Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to disAPPitchfork everybody you meet.
And please let reporters ask you questions rather than having your staff shut them down... #LetUsAsk
better get the RULES changed then...
@TammaraMaiden1 the reality is undeniable https://twitter.com/riskyliberal/status/829165141757460480 …
& She was told "take her seat". #BlackHistoryMonth
Mitch McConnell silences a white woman reading the opinion of a black women about a racist during black history month #LetLizSpeak
just following Senate rules, wait, what? Forgot, Dems want everyone else 2 follow rules/laws except them.  ERISA/Delphi o yea
@SenatorCollins We're becoming more like Russia.  Ironic; rule used prot'd southern Sens having to hear anti-slavery talk
Can you print this rule that got Sen. Warren red carded. We the common people of NY are confused at the secret rules.
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr it is outrageous. Warren broke Senate rules. Asked and answered.
especially given a male senator read the same letter with no penalty at all.
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @SenGillibrand What R U  going 2 do? We  R Looking 4  Bold Actions ! ! #Resist
,  I think she's said enough.. We're sick of her race baiting & accusations. It's sickening, she is the worst of ur kind.
follow the rules and get over it, start working and stop whining.
Republicans don't want to hear the truth,always putting party before the good of the country and it's people.Shameful
A racist is a presidential advisor, the president can insult judges but she can't read this statement.  Misogyny reins
why? Do you think she needs to follow the rules?
: Curious, do you believe rules should be broken? @FoxNews
@_juliannemoore I love it when women get,silenced by men! Hahahahahahahaha!
she does not serve anymore she only tries to divide
you violate the rules of Senate, you get a time out.  Grow up
it's the rules they apply to everyone that's why @POTUS won election citizens got sick of the lawlessness the DNP let exist
@_juliannemoore Shame...!
attacking another colleague is ok then? 
Not to worry.  Fauxcahontas speaks smoke signals, doesn't she?
"The Senator Will Take Her Seat"
LMFAO, this "resistance" is going swell.
#RulesDontApply
Dems should sue-get court's input? Big $Republicans are overrunning our country #VoteAllRepublicansOUT #McConnellShouldResign
GOOD for HIM! Enough HOT AIR
We got your back, @SenWarren ! My fiancée and I are calling our senators (Tillis & Burr) to read Mrs. Kings letter to them.
Right, @JennytheCatLady ? They need to hear it!
@SenWarren now @GOP hates U all for standing up-they say pick your battles. They are ALL our battles. We the ppl respect U!
#ShePersisted
You know this came from the WH. #Standup #resist #letlizspeak
pick up the ball Senator.  Don't let him silence women who speak the truth
Another democrat who doesn't want to follow the rules or laws. Shocking (sic).

Last week, #SallyYates was silenced.
This week, #ElizabethWarren

#LetLizSpeak #CorettaScottKing …
. Please along with other female members of the Senate from both sides #Standup #resist Take control #LetLizSpeak
.@SenGillibrand @SenWarren Sen. Gillibrand, read that letter on the floor today. Get Chuck to read it. Get everyone to read it.
The future is  #NEVERTHELESSSHEPERSISTED
thisw as use of rules to censure.If sessions not a senator she could not have been silenced.
are we witnessing death of our democracy? What's left of the Republican Party? We do have insurgents, but from w/in I fear.
Dave, not sure you noticed, but Republicans are winning. Dem party is in shambles with nothing but kooky candidates
sadly forced to 'mostly' agree. Only a few good people left for Dems. They've lost their way & we are paying.
A few good Dems left? Name one!
a slap on the face to every woman who has been told by a man to sit down and shut up 
She Was Warned. She Was Given An Explanation. Yet She Persisted is now the rallying cry of all women. Thanks @SenateMajLdr !
Ling letter already part of Senate record so what's the big deal. Warren getting under Mitch's skin. Go Beth!
it is. Thank you for standing up. Please don't stop #resist
Everyone should close their statements be reading that letter!!!
So more of us will think the Democratic Party is so far unhinged and their candidates are toast
it's like the Salem Witch Trials.....I'd run if they start shouting burn the witch.....well not me, I'm Wiccan lol
I like the way he is talking to you -Ricky Bobby
@SenWarren  He is a disgrace to our democracy. Pls. Keep fighting these POS (sorry;-) )
sing it, sister #letlizspeak
it is an affront to the Constitution & Bill of Rights that man with Sessions' record should even have been nominated
For @SenateMajLdr to silence @SenWarren with an archaic rule created to prevent discussion of abolition is the gravest betrayal
So in other words, the Dems have been hurt by their own rule once again!
Yes, it certainly was!
right ACA being racist to American Indians is a travesty you should be prosecuted for defending discrimination & bigotry
All need to stand up for @SenWarren #Resist the racism & fascism rising in @GOP
Curious, what's your stance on suppressing conservatives on college campuses?
Thank you for all you are doing at this time, Senator.
As per @GeorgeTakei every one of the Democratic senators should get up and read from Mrs. Kings letter
Reps are scared about truth being revealed? It's a shame they are using their majority to push all of the nefarious agenda
@SenWarren @SenatorSessions @SenateMajLdr @YouTube    thank you for that 
persist
Wrong. Well, for the Left having to obey Rules and be held accountable actually might be. So maybe ur right.
#Persist #Resist
