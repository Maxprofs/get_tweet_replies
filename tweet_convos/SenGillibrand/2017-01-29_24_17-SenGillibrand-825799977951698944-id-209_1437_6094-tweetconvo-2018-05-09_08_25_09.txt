.@POTUS's Executive Order on immigrants and refugees is a mark of shame on our country. And it makes us less safe.
It's an absolute moral and ethical failure, and goes against everything the Statue of Liberty represents and our New York values.
#Kirsten2020
You are our next President (just saying...)
Thank you for standing up. And for voting no on poor cabinet picks. Please keep up the good work you do representing NY.
if you are white and live in this country you came here from immigrants

Cutting off immigration from countries which breed terrorism is just common sense if your honest and not a lying liberal.

How #ban makes us less safe: non-white citizens will not step forward as witnesses to help police solve crimes
@TheDemocrats http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-kentucky-us-dozens-terrorists-country-refugees/story?id=20931131 … odd how you don't mention this?
