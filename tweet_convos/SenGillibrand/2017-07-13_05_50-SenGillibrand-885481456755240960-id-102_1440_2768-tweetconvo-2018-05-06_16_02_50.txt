#DearBetsy: Abolish the Department of Education and return education to state/local level, where this can be more closely watched.
Omg no! I grew up in South Carolina. Believe me, you do NOT want that kind of ignorance teaching children. We need standards.
That was the excuse for establishing the DoE 40+ years ago. It's a failure. Time to eliminate social engineering and bring back academics.
It's not a failure. Never has been. But if you let states design their own curriculum, SC kids will think Jesus rode dinosaurs.
And seriously what the hell is wrong with federal standards?
You said it was a failure. Please explain.
Have someone read this to you and put it in whatever language you understand, then come explain what part you're confused about.
You said it is a failure. But you never explain. How has the doe failed Americans? You can't answer can you? You are just parroting. Sad.
No. MEN have a serious rape problem. Maybe try to get your shit together and stop raping women.
So you are saying only progressive men get educations?
FYI, rape doesn't just happen on campus. 1 in 5 women will experience sexual assault bc you men can't control yourself.
Did you follow me purely just to comment on things I post?
Secretary DeVos is a disgrace!  She's as big an embarrasment as her boss.
Ditzy devos won't read/care. She'll just leave it to jesus
Please also compel her deputy @CEJacksonLaw to zip it - since she clearly has no clue!
wrong Senator - justice is supposed to be fair and blind. innocent people r not 2b suspended, punished, expelled if innocent. #justiceforall
she don't care about people she cares about money...
Isn't that what Jesus cares about too?? (Sarcasm, just in case it doesn't read) 
She is clueless about everything to do with her job.Needs 2 b removed as Sec. of Education.Her $$ didn't qualify her 4 the position.
two words. Columbia settled
When are you going to put ratification of #Equal Rights Amend front & center of your political agenda?   #HandmaidsTale #ERANow
Money doesn´t buy everything ... conscience is just one of them
Experience in education is another
I have been assaulted 3 times; at age 6, 28 and 57.  I froze each time trying to be a good girl.  6 I buried  28 I froze and 57 I froze Help
This is just another example of how Betsy DeVos is not qualified and is a complete abomination.
Betsy Devos need to leave
Thank you
educate kids on affirmative consent but denying basic due process to accused is wrong. rape is hard to prove cant just assume guilt however
Send her "The Hunting Game" & talk to your partner in shedding light on the subject @ChuckGrassley #DearBetsy  @BetsyDeVos I'm a #CollegeMom
can't believe there are actually people like you that are so ignorant and not recognizing what is one sided propaganda
Be more specific...What propaganda? Ad hominems aren't worth my time. Have you seen #TheHuntingGame ? My daughter is heading for college 1/2
Are you saying she will not be at risk of sexual assault if she stays sober? Facts don't bear that out. If you have sourced info, share it.
The GOP is hell bent on destroying any legislation by President Obama ' s administration , regardless of it's merit.
this admin has many ppl who appear actively to perpetuate child rape and its lucrative business partner, child prostitution. Self-serving???
Did Paul Nungesser and other victims like him have an opportunity to speak?
Listen without legitimizing misogynistic, myth-spreading organizations that undermine victims.
She doesn't give two f%€*s
No denying this is an important fight — the fight must be fair and protect the due process rights of both survivors and accused
You should apologize for mattress girl. Columbia just settled too.
They ought to ask dems why the laws against rape are not vigorously enforced, when they hear you making social excuses for their attackers!
I'm concerned because you are getting your news from Teen Vogue. Do you also subscribe to Rolling Stone? #falseaccusersarecriminals
What I find more appalling is that you are a US Senator, you of all people should be supporting the Constitution, which dictates fair trials
Nice strawman.
Evil? Clueless? Destructive?
Hofstra, Duke, UVA, Allegheny, Lynn University, University of Texas, Colombia(w/ your favorite #MattressGirl)
@BetsyDeVosED 
#GoBetsy
She's no business being in her position.Another embarrassing idiot w/power.One day a qualified person will replace all of them.She's awful.
Does she own another ugly suit? She's always wearing that ugly suit
You should ALSO listen to falsely accused students. A one sided narrative resulted in the one sided system we have now.
Betsy if you come anywhere near Ct I will back hand you. #SexualAssaultSurvivor #IWAS15
Betsy is too busy shoving her religious beliefs down the throats of r children.
Devos barely understands the difference between HBC and NCAA!!   I'm not sure she's really up to date on many issues of the 21st century.
apparently you and @SenGillibrand barely understand the difference btw Kangaroo Courts and Due Process.
Best impersonation of "deer in the headlights".
As a Michigander, I can tell you we all know the DeVos family only listens when money talks.
Thank you for fighting the good fight Senator. My God @SecBetsyDeVosED, you are supposed to protect ALL students. #HeavenHelpUs
only an absolute fool can believe protecting all students=fighting for the rights of only the alleged victims
I voted 4 u. For3 yrs I have asked u to listen to my story. But u won't as it flies against your narrative. Hypocrite
this woman couldn't care less.  has no clue.  just horrible.
Im assuming your talking about @SenGillibrand who has no clue about due process.
More women can protect themselves from assault if you would support gun rights. 500K times per year guns save lives- but you ignore facts.
"Who are you here to serve?" #BetsyDevos serves white, rich, straight. We MUST get rid of her!!!
Please read these!
@TuesdaysToomey #DearBetsy
"Who are you here to serve"? Great question! You have done nothing 4 ur Delphi constituents since ur 1st day in office. Why? Please respond.
I ask you to listen to the victims of false accusations and understand just why we're in this fight to restore due process.
How can women do this to each other?
Respectfully Senator- she does not care for anything that does not profit her or her friends
She will ignore them, as she has already decided that they do not matter to her messed up agenda.
STOP already about all these sexual assults and START  working on fixing terrible Obama care.
#DearBetsy is a cold, calculating billionaire incapable of human understanding or empathy. I can't even imagine her idea of heaven.
apparently having "empathy" to you means ignoring the hundreds of falsely accused students who's lives have been ruined
She has a tin ear #Devos
If you want a different answer maybe you (sen G) should do your job and pass non discrimination laws. Not her job to make laws.
Devos does not care so sad

She does not give one shit about sexual assault.
sadly, I don't think she cares.
sexual assault happens not only at schools/colleges but at work, at home & everywhere in between unfortunately so stop making it about 1 grp
She doesn't care, just like the rest of his cabinet.
Please #DearBetsy MEET with these women and hear their stories! Thank you Sen Gillibrand, fight on!
seems Trump admin's&GOP's goal is 2 eliminate any law or service intended to help anyone below the 1%, anything that signifies human decency
are all falsely accused students in the 1%? Do you have any stats on that?
Betsy is here at the behest of our Leader to serve the 1% because that's who she is and that's who she cares about. @VP @BetsyDeVosED @CNN
Trumps people don't seem to listen.
Devos is religious extremist, judgement & blame is default w/respect to assault on women- she's incapable of listening
Perhaps she listened to you, but determined a one sided narrative is incomplete, and bad for making policy.
more fake sexual assault news! just keep ur pants on.
Agree! DeVos is beyond unqualified and is using the office for personal gain.
Kick Betsy to the curb.
99.9% of this went on before her watch-Some of it during your Senate tenure.  Ask for help/don't chastise.  This shouldn't be political.
I'm from Michigan and can tell you that she WILL NOT listen. She lives in a bubble and has no idea about the real world.
Perhaps you live in a bubble if you think your side of the narrative is the only one worth considering
Like many of Trump's cabinet and nominees, DeVos is grossly under-qualified. This is cronyism at its worse.
Thank you! She must be stopped from inflicting any more harm!
Like Trump..
Send her "The Hunting Game"; have her talk to @ChuckGrassley , who partnered with you to shed light on the subject. @JoeBiden enlighten her!
As a victim myself I know how long it takes 2 get 2 pt where life doesn't seem as overwhelming. Are u a woman? Don't make them victims again
She will have survivors and victims making sandwiches for these felons before long. It's not sex it's violence against women
What has she done, specifically, that has led you to that conclusion?

I think @BetsyDevoes should suffer horribly somehow.
yeah, more violence. that will help
When you're the least competent in a group that also includes rick perry, you know there is a serious level of cronyism
Ugh. I can't wait until the ENTIRE @realDonaldTrump administration is removed from office.
You only have 7.5 yrs to go!!!
#MAGA
^^^clearly supports #Russian interference in #American democratic processes.
 and now come the "insults".. please, "sir"... continue to *dazzle* us with ur intellect.
Thank you 
yes, cat lady feminist living in her postmodern reality thanks @SenGillibrand
Betsy is a willing part of @realDonaldTrump's "Grab America by the Pussy Tour" as described in the chorus.
She wont listen.
That criminal was chosen there for evil purposes
@SenGillibrand you'll get more attention on this if you curse
#DearBetsy what about the sex scandal at Emma? Didn't you go to school there?
De Vos is terribly misguided giving an ounce of respect to the so-called MRA groups. This is rape apologia & misogyny championed.
Senator, she is in so far over her head
Thank you @SenGillibrand for continually standing up for survivors of sexual assault. We are lucky to have you fighting for us!!
um so automatically believing someone and ignoring due process is now considered the good public servant!
Thank you for using your voice & platform to shine light on these issues, Senator. Thankful for how you champion for survivors everywhere 
#DearBetsy - Please listen and learn.
Correct. ....
