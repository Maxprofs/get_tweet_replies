Thank you for fighting the good fight, Senator! Proud you represent us New Yorkers!
@BrooksDslbrooks @POTUS @widowspider @SenGillibrand who cares the number of women/men. What's important is the job. NOT gender
Yes, and so far they are doing a shit job.
give them a couple days.
AMEN SISTER!
: keep working to break that glass ceiling! We're behind you!!
@SkepticNikki @HuffPostPol "legislating women's bodies?" If women took responsibility 4their bodies it wouldn't be an issue
@EJLandwehr @HuffPostPol you got that right but most White women voted for this!
Ah but the question is will they be dressed like vaginas or  be half naked or fully naked? #Offthesidelines
It doesn't matter what gender the POTUS is, as long as he/she gets the damn job done and makes the country better
Please tell these guys you're introducing a bill to outlaw viagra.
Gross! 2017 we are treat like a 2nd class citizens!
You'll never see a room full of women legislating men's bodies in your entire life. I'm so sick of this.
@SkepticNikki @HuffPostPol Total sausagefest!
Notice the desktop of BLOTUS and its resemblance to his brain - both EMPTY.
but not appoint them, right?
Thank you for fighting for us!
@SkepticNikki @HuffPostPol Women can be powerful & influential anywhere Especially the ones who choose 2raise future leaders!
If any laws get passed/Executive Orders against women, I think we women are up for a massive nation wide strike!
great! Who's gonna do the dishes?
Would love to see programs designed to mentor young girls in government. Do we have any?
KG, you're great!  Please don't change your vote as you become our next president
Is there aything a non-US citizen can do to help, Senator?
Republicans marched on November 8th, so you go ahead & march whenever you want to.  Just know we already did!
I hope you're considering 2020!
@KrisSanchez @HuffPostPol its sad that it took a room full of men to protect our BABIES!  wow women are at an all time low
I think we should tackle this with comedy & as a #FemaleEngineer I will turn to #BigBangTheory: involve them!:
@KrisSanchez @HuffPostPol yeah that's a problem
Continuing to play the "identity" strategy is getting you nowhere fast........
It is imperative that women who marched step up and run for office. #StandWithGillibrand
@jenscorpio83 @HuffPostPol women, Latinos, African Americans...
Deplorable
Thank you for not voting for  swamp cabinet members.  
Stay strong  
I wish  Chuckie also did not vote 4 swamp cabinet
.@Purplegarter1 @SenGillibrand Why are your peers approving ANY of Trump's picks? BLOCK SCOTUS too!
This Is Disgraceful.  I say we introduce a Bill to begin regulating Men's Sperm.
Why should women have any say in what happens to their bodies? They didn't in 19th Century did they?
Really, what men want women with no reproductive rights. Scary.
@shannonrwatts @HuffPostPol explain why you voted yes..
. True What a woman does with her body should be between she and whomever she calls her maker. Not old white men.
And one of them should replace @SenSchumer. I'm glad you have principles and the spine to vote by them. You honor our state.
@ja_maloneco @HuffPostPol noticed they had some women in the photos today. But just the crypt keeper and some randos.
@wonderfullone @HuffPostPol 
Everytime I see a woman next to him, I wonder how often their groped..."How They Got the Job"...
Completely agree.   Love to see you run for President in 2020.   I think you have a lot in common with Bernie Sanders
@HuffPost @ActivismNow  Yes, please! What can we do to help you??!
. @SenGillibrand @HuffPostPol please run!
.@SenGillibrand @MAHAMOSA They save the GOP women for propaganda shoots and legislation.
@MAHAMOSA @HuffPostPol go home… you're not helping… they war against the people and the planet and all you can do is pretend
Thank you for your votes against Trump's cabinet picks.
@Trumpnado2016 @HuffPostPol We need more feminists in office. Male or female, I'll take whatever I can get.
But you want the same "roomful of men" to force us to pay for your healthcare and birth control....so which is it?
are you similarly opposed to coverage for ED meds?
Yes I am opposed to all taxpayer funding for prescription drugs.  Fair?
Women walking down the street dressed in vagina costumes really shows intelligence and dignity #offthesidelines
Ugh!
@jmkarmstrong @HuffPostPol  that's called 1950.. Great again indeed 

This is an absolute atrocity.
so disgusting- a room full of white men thinking they're masters of the universe... how unusual!
I think you're awesome!
Pleeease!!  We have a women in office & she hasn't done a damn thing 4 her Delphi constituents. Nothing, nada, 0
Absolutely true, now more than ever! Keep standing up for us KG! We have so much faith in you!
Jared Kushner looks embarrassed, as he should be.
Save us, Senator Gillibrand!
Truth.
ugh
keep up the good work Senator
Old white boys club in action
hearing your name more and more for President 2020.  Together we will take a sledge hamer to glass ceiling.
THE OLD BOYS NETWORK.  SHAME SHAME SHAME
There are so many reasons. Everyday brings on a new one with trump.
Thank you @SenGillibrand for standing up for the people and voting no on Trump's picks. You are a hero.
How about tougher legislation to make men be more accountable & responsible for infants they help make?
Gillibrand for President 2020.
It is fair to remember that Trump wasn't legitimately elected. Intervention by Putin's spies invalidated his candidacy.
Trump surrounded by puppets that don't care he is ruling by executive order
Enough of the Hillary lost hissy fit
get off of it, they are not regulating woman's bodies, tell the truth

- You mean liberal women. Conservative women don't count, right?
unbelievable 
they are not legislating woman's bodies.  They are protecting babies bodies.  There actually is a difference.
thank you speaking out against this. No man should be able to tell me what I can do with my body.
yes Kirsten! Let's raise our daughters to have a day!
if you expect to elect more women? You need to quit generalizing by bashing all men!
Thanks for the work that you do for us.
2/2 ... what men can do with their reproductive organs
1/2  Twitter comment: As long as you live you'll never see a photo of 7 women signing legislation about ...
at all levels (local, state, federal)-- needs to be a wave lining up to swamp 2018
Please keep fighting for #WomensRights against this #patriarchy Senator. American women are depending on you.
Shocked to see just one woman among the leaders of Congress meeting with the President when we are 51% of the population
@marcylauren @HuffPostPol you need to get the Republicans out of office. We don't want Republican women
 The WHITE man at it again.
true and more must be done to keep perverts out of office , there is at least one in this picture !!!
Ms 1 dissenting voter: as a nys resident  I'm going to do my part to get you out of office!
Makes me so furious!!
Anything you need, we are here to help!  Keep fighting Senator!  We love the work you're doing!   
.@SenGillibrand  Indeed...  Photos of the business people #Trump has met with in first 2 days look much like this one.
The right women who support reproductive health and choice!
It's hilarious that you liked this tweet. But, I agree!
I hear he also signed orders to put the Dakota pipeline back on.  This is horrible news.
Love that bird!
how about Gillibrand 2020??!!!
Hope you'll consider running for president in 2020.
How do we stop what's going on now? What about the investigation?
