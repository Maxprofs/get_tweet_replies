Do you live in NY? Then how dare you? We pay outrageous state income tax. Just received a PSEG bill - 498! LIRR $350 for this month!
Guess what? Under the GOP plan you will no longer be able longer be able to deduct your state or property taxes. Educate yourself.
Geeze, I mangled that, LOL!
Did you know that you get hit with AMT and that deduction means CRAP. Most don't know that they are paying it. So yes, I educated myself.
Actually,most who pay do know,since they are required to fill out a special form. Obama's American Tax Relief Act of 2012 eased it for most.
You realize that Alternative Min Tax prevents you from taking all those deductions. If you try to deduct home taxes (especially LI & Westch
you don't get to deduct the whole thing because your income would fall too low. Then they would owe you money. Most people do not know about
Alternative Min Tax. It was supposed to be for the rich but in NY 2 working people can fall into a higher bracket bc on paper we make more.
Why does GOPalways make the rich, richer &the poor,poorer? That's not the American Dream
It's the GOP way.

Why should the people of Arizona subsidize NY. Low income pple dont pay TAXES they get earned income tax credit = stealing from mid income.
Stop the misinformation tactic. Work for ur voters not ur party. U will lose seat soon enough. Until then ur vote does not matter. Gosh
We need to drain the swamp and you are part of it!  You’ve been in office how long with no tax reform#drain
Big Corp doesn't even pay the 35% after all their deductions and loopholes
And your refusal is part of the never ending - not me - do it to someone else.
Awful how rich get richer, corporations pay less and avg guys gets screwed. Republicans adding to deficit with this plan
What a surprise

Unpopular = I want a tax increase on all but bottom 40%. If we can't insure 100% health, fix roads and have a space program = we've failed.
Of course! because yes they will pay more. Plan helps the rich. Just makes no sense. Except to the $$$$
But how else are they going to afford their plane rides. 
So is abolition of the estate tax that only affects estates over $7 million. I call it the Dynasty Tax.
You're so right.  Should be obvious.
Stop lying to your people.
Actually, corporations don't pay taxes, people do. Corporations are only tax collectors. Customer pays those taxes via higher prices.
Got to get the money for your communist socialist puke programs from somewhere.
You could have voted AGAINST the Family Medical Leave Act which is a tax.
I cannot afford anymore increases of anything. This is crazy. Please stop this madman.
#NYStateIncomeTaxes make #AllThingsExpensive in #NewYork #ThatsBad
#WellManagedStates dont #ImposeProgressive #OppressiveIncomeTaxes #BeGlad
The smaller States are tired,of supporting NY and California.
You mean like Bernie's single payer plan?
So let's fix NYS overburdensom tax rates.  Other states seem to do well without bankrupting their citizens.  Start with the welfare state.
Great plan if corporations hire bring back manufacturing that we lost because of Clinton and Obama middle class have had it with the Dems
#you think
Families making less than $150k need the biggest tax break. Rich people don't need tax savings
Why don’t you tell Cuomo to lower NYS middle class taxes in line with other states taxes.
Keep fighting for us
What does the majority of large corporations pay as a % of their taxes. Some pay 0%.

But be sure to take care of their rich friends.
Their plan is F the dem states that they know they can't win in 20. I would hope the GOP pols in NY, NJ etc. would oppose that but who knows
Great you're going to get gov Cuomo to cut state income taxes  
I am so SICK about the dangerous pathetic direction this country is taking. No wonder so many thousands are giving up citizenship.
Yes it's a bad plan. Don't pay it, and go to jail. You won't have to worry about your class. You'll be a criminal, and fully supported.
Isn't NYS giving tax incentives to companies that move there?

Republicans don't care about mid to low income people .
And despite being from NY, Trump can not make #GOP like NY. They HATE the lib Jew gay city that is arguably the 'capital of the world'.
Here’s an idea. Cut outrageously high state taxes for middle class New Yorkers
Wr are getting taxed to death right now.
We pay enough in taxes. Especially, the self employed.
Get you fax wright!!!!!
@SpeakerRyan is lying about guns & taxes &!women's health. Why? He's no Einstein but he's not not smart. In his heart & mind he must suffer
Negotiate with Republicans. What is your initial counteroffer?
Voters need to know that @realDonaldTrump rolled back Obama's provision on gun control in January. There will be many more mass shootings
I don't think so sweetie stop your people from being stupid and stop shooting each other
What's your plan? Or does that question not cross your mind?
Or else it means the city & state tax too much.
AMT knocks out the SALT deductions already.  Lower income benefits from higher standard and middle will be a crapshoot.
Why don't we all take a break & just let the 1% earn their pay. They can do the work themselves!
Would they rather have more jobs to pay taxes or less tax no job?
What a dumb thought since they won't have to. Might as well say if the sun doesn't come up tomorrow it will be a bad day.
DemoRats, O'Bummer, Clinton, all didn't give a crap about the Middle Class. That's why they Dumped on us for Decades.
But they can definitely rule out tax hikes for themselves. Guaranteed.
If New Yorkers are tired of high taxes, then get rid of the damn DemoRat Potty. Dems never, ever saw a tax they didn't like. Crocodile Tears
Thrilled to know that you are my senator
Love you Kirsten
you don't help the economy by taxing the Middle class. We are the ones who buy stuff
SENATOR THOSE LARGE CORPORATIONS MAKE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS !LET THEM PAY FAIR SHARE !SO OUR COUNTRY IS OUT OF BURDEN!
They pay their fair share but apportion over seas.   It’s too complicated for twitter.  Bad job by the senator in explaining.
Trickle down economics. It will make more jobs. I guarantee it. Trust me. Best plan yet.
Not for Trump and Mnuchin. Don't worry about them. They'll make out great.
