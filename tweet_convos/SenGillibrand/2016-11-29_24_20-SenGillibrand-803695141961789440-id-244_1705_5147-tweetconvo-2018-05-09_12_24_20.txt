Do you have the slightest clue how business works? margins in the businesses where low skilled labor works is razor thin
Stop it with the BS. A 400% increase in CEO salaries. While workers in the same time frame have  gotten a 7% pay.
why is that your problem? CEO is worth what a board chooses to pay 2 compete workers can move increase skill
That is a straight up con job PERIOD. Then let the CEOs do the work and do not use the workers See who is important
that is just dumb! If you're worth more than go get it. Company & govt owe you nothing. Take charge of you
Then workers owe the companies nothing. If you cannot pay a living wage. You do not deserve a business PERIOD.
clueless, absolutely clueless. It doesn't say non for profit on sign. Workers are free to leave if not happy
That's immoral period. To say a company has the right to pay substandard wages for profit.
From the 2015 guidelines, poverty is $11,770 for one person. $7.25 x 2080 (~hrs in work year) = $15,080. Explain?
explanation: guidelines don't effectively take into account true cost of living regionally.
then it would be silly to make one dollar amount the minimum. Why not $25 per hour?
minimum wage should be varied by region. In some cities, that's what it should be.
you missed have missed the day they taught basic economics in school! Here's a picture that will catch you up.
too bad there's no machines that can make food affordably, and that when one of those goes down, they all do.
Yes a kid flipping burgers full time should afford a home and food and clothes etc.
Learn why we have a minimum wage! https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act …
Bullshit. Laboring to produce or supply goods and services is no shame. Your ancestors would hate you!
Yeah we should break out ovens for them huh? Fuck you Nazi!
@PayDownTheDebt great book on this topic by Barbara Ehrereich, Nickle and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America
sorry misspelled: Barbara Ehrenreich
umm.  I had roommates to help pay the bills and then joined the military.  Worked hard!
check how much a new person going in the service he or she isn't making $15 /hour and they protect the country
wouldn't a 60 hour work week accomplish the same and make everyone happy? Who are we protecting at 40? How many hrs do u work
@jimmy_dore no its about the taxex. People are taxxed to death
How about we start creating live-able wages by not taxing the hell out of workers' income.
@jimmy_dore 15$ an hour will destroy small businesses.
you don't read much do ya buddy, it's 2016 update your argument because it's false now.
there you go, its ok to correct. Thankyou.
Well I appreciate you admitting when you are wrong it happens, at least you use critical thinking!
Min wage = false promise. Price levels readjust. After few years no change std living. Automation takes jobs. #LaborSecretary #womeninbiz
So those who are working outside the home for maybe $15/hour are now going to have to pay min $15/hr for childcare as well?
If you had a private nanny, yes it should be $15/hr. Most people split that in something called "daycare".
Point...childcare costs will increase. Companies will pass increase to consumer & negate effect of wage increase.
exactly anyone who thinks companies will absorb the cost nope they pass cost on to consumers
Except consistently when it's been raised in the past (in the US and other countries) that's not what happened.
companies won't lose money McDonald's on West coast already installing kiosk and self service dropping employees
They are doing that at current minimum wage. Automation has always been a thing. What is your solution?
Um, love ya Kirsten but, Trump's cabinet will abolish the min. wage & bring back child labor!
he sure will. Did you read that before you posted? Give me a break.
What is your problem?
do you really believe he will bring back child labor? When did a president have that authority?
OK, try & keep up.  His new Sec. of education is Betsy DeVos. She's advocated doing away with child labor laws for years!
I’ll try. She can’t institute that by herself or she would have years ago. Relax.
When Republicans control the WH & both houses of Congress & appoint a RW SC judge, they can do anything they want & they will!
We will see.
Really? Tell me why they deserve a higher wage? #McRobot Took Ya Job! #Maga
you make 100k+ a year. You really think $15 hourly wage gonna improve anything?
.@SenGillibrand Great. We need as many people as possible in the #democraticparty and fighting for #progressive values. #progressivealliance
Forcing me to pay entry-level employees skilled-level wages makes me unable to hire entry-level employees.
so if the get $15hr wage do the tax you take out go down or go up. #15minwage
If you raise it, you increase costs, prices and lower buying power.  LOWER the wage and it will improve lives.
At even $12/hr minimum I could no longer hire entry level employees to train them from the ground up.
Spoiler alert! $15/hr is living in poverty. Should be $25/hr at this point!!!
Will you "stand" when workers are replaced by robotics or prices skyrocket ? Take an economics class. You're embarrassing
and if they get it! I'll be standing in the poverty line unable to afford a $6 Big Mac
thank you Senator!
@SenSanders Amen,!
it's not going 2end poverty.have you ever taken an economics course? The supply of money will increase and its value decrease
Why are you so eager to have businesses in your state to close thier doors? The poverty arguement is an emotional straw man.
@SenSanders say bye bye to jobs in the US then! And bye bye to small businesses! Everyone has a choice and opportunities
@BDamatin no single pers can live on $15 in BOS it's 100% IMPOSSIBLE so if $15 aint a prob y not make it $20+? @BryanJBerner
prices will go up so $20 isn't enough either. As long as we all don't understand economics lol.
i was being sarcastic 
this is insane. You really should take an economics course.
u trust @SenGillibrand ? U opinion matters.
Hmmm . . . they're demanding twice what Gillbrand is worth.  That can't be fair.
Did your Wall Street masters approve ur message Gilli? Gosh these corporate slave corrupts tell anything for vote
@SenSanders unfortunately McDonald's is prepping tech, to go self-checkout style.  If the news is at all credible.
@SenSanders do you understand with a $15 minimum wage a third of the workers any business will be laid
@TammySouthwick1 The only reason for poverty in US is because of the governmental abuses it created.Obamacare,corp taxes, etc
@Freedom1776__ Heck yes give them the raise get them off public assistance and no more food stamps love it
Whatever you do, stay out of progressives way and don't run in 2020.
@SenSanders $25/hr. Cost of living is high in the cities.
why not $20
Just to be clear
$15/hr x 40 x 52 = $31,200/yr gross
probably not even close to what you two pay in property tax
You can't #Fightfor15 in the morning and #fightfor15Million from Clinton donors at night. @EmmaVigeland @TYTPolitics #DemExit
@SenSanders - does "standing with them" mean you'll take only $15/hr as Senator & return the rest 2 taxpayers? No? #Pandering
Oh, your tweet is sooo original.  I see Dem leaders sent out email telling you what to think and say.  #cantfixstupid
minorities should never vote dem again. Their policies lead to Venezuela results.
The 30K fast food complaint is ludicrous. Very few kids flipping burgers get 40 hrs/week.
@SenSanders them get a fucking education some business can't operate on that pay as swipe fucking comy
@SenSanders I'm actually for Politicians working for $15 it's a public service job yet senators are millionaires ironic huh?
Do that & employers will go to part time only!!! Most employers already have!!
dont we realize that a community together is indestructible?
Carrier in Indiana will have to drop to $5 / hour to be profitable.
@jonpier oh those were the days! When fighting for a decent minimum wage was the goal vs saving the Republic from Fascism
$15 an hour is not a living wage. People need education&training for better paying jobs. YOU & DNC r selling a hoax
@SenSanders but first they need to get my order right.
Only hope I write 2 anti Trump peeps w/ $$$ comfort 2 help fund http://Jillstein.nationbuilder.com/results  & tell electors they have a choice
@SenSanders RN retired @ 65, wages had flat lined, 403b losses, house devalued to below $ owed. Filed bankruptcy d/t cancer
why not 20? Is it too much?
@SenSanders I own a small construction co. I can not pay 15 a hour. I pay 12 now. I could pay 15 cash .
For yrs employers have a way around paying full time wages & benefits . Make all or must employees = 39hrs or less
@SenSanders how much do you make an hour?
no one is working full time since Obamacare (which left me sick w no ins) was rammed down our throats @MyHumanCompass
@SenSanders I agree but the military should be paid better than  McDonald's worker they are forgotten same with fire n police
How about passing legislation to reduce tax cost so they won't NEED job destroying min wage @ $15/hr
@CharlieaWhite  And while we are at it, can we eliminate 
child poverty and homelessness?
That will make America Great!!
Cost of living is quite different in various places of the USA.  Making one minimum wage is nonsensical.
the party will never change unless u stop being a corporate paid to lose dem party,your already setup to take big donor money
that's why you supported the candidate that thought a $12 minimum wage was just fine and helped the country have pres trump
@SenSanders 15 dollars an hour will put a lot of Business out of Business. What better pay get a better JOB
no 1 living in USA should have 2 work 4 jobs 2 create existence withn the greatest country
"Dictate" a minimum wage?
@AFLCIO Please tell me where a family can live on $15. an hour.
then be better at your job to earn more?  Why do we always feel the need to just hand out things to those who refuse effort?
When will you Stand to stop the greedy hearts of Congress to tax the people to take away our freedom?
What are you going to do with businesses who then decide to decrease full-time positions for more part-time jobs?
guess what? $15 an hour is still poverty
@SenSanders Future president? Gillibrand is corporate Dem. See $ received for KORUS. http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/112-hr-3080/1015862/total- … contributions
@SenSanders make education cheaper and available for all. Education shouldn't be a privilege.
@SenSanders no one should live in poverty when they work full time. $15/hr for remedial jobs tho? Go bk 2 school.
Those jobs were never and don't have the value of a full time career.  they are temporary jobs
so get a better job...why would anyone stay at a job that doesn't pay enough...jeesh
@SenSanders wage slaves voted for trump
@jimmy_dore about fucking time.
I work full time, have a degree, make what works out to be $17.50ish an hour. Still barely can feed my kids.
@SenSanders Let's not forget the lives of those at Standing Rock that greed has ruined!  #NoDAPL #WaterIsLife
@rbaker65708 yall just need to mention on the floor it will disqualify millions for foodstamps and welfare.Easy method 4 hate
@SenSanders Bring real JOBS to this state!
you needsome education. 
Start with Thomas Sowell's _Basic Economics_
You're full of cr*p you supported Hillary who never saw a corporate donation she didn't drool over, fracking, Monsanto/GMO's
Let me know when your in WNY. We need 2 talk about what u have not done 4 ur Delphi constituents & what they have put up with
@SenSanders anyone that would argue against paying a living wage has never worked minimum wage
@SenSanders allowing a few at the top to profit by paying people at the bottom less is crazy.
Increasing wages is not the solution of poverty. Controlling prices could help to stay immune against corruption.
OMG. No 1 working full time should live in poverty? Ur Delphi constituents lost up to 70% of their pensions & live in poverty
@SenSanders  if min wage goes up $6/hr does that mean everyone already over that gets a $6 raise? Boosts poor/hurts mid class
That is not my fault. Improve yourself if you want to be worth more.
@SenSanders lol.just seen the back rooms of walmart. paying the labor to do everything manually. No way companies can absorb
instead of enabling access to entrepreneurship, you'll hasten automation and job loss #rpa #automation
@SenSanders thre needs to be a chnge in comp mtrics and ideolgy; enctng $15 min wge will be pssd onto custmr negating benfts
@SenSanders Thank you.
That's not what Trump and the GOP think.
well we all know that, except for his voters--most of which likely earn minimum.
oh, so you can respond to protests quickly. #NoDAPL
how does cost of living factor in? $15 goes a lot farther in some areas, so why should it be the same rate across the country
@SenSanders Pay $15 minimum wage and the homeless numbers will skyrocket. Those working will only have inflation to face.
You and Elizabeth Warren need to get out of your million dollar mansion and grasp reality.
We'll most of them voted for Trump so let's let them ask him for a higher min wage. ROFL
you should stand for no more cliches in your support posts.
@S
enSanders
@jimmy_dore Lots of Dems are trying out Bernie's language.  Let's see if they'll emulate his actions.
If you had thrown your support in for the candidate who wanted this in the Primary we wouldn't be in this mess now.
and stand with labor unions and the right for workers to organize!
those that don't work full time deserve poverty 

and are lazy evil people that should be deported
Sanders said it better
until you learn the concept of "no cheese" on my burger,  then kiss off!  #Fightfor15 my ass.
Great, now you're creating a lot of part-time jobs.
If you get your way everyone on Social Security will be living in poverty.  Raise Social Security too.
while the idea is beautiful  companies would just hire robots so they could afford to stay open. Makes zero economic sense.
common sense isn't an option when all u want r votes right @SenGillibrand ?
HRC clone in "Super Clone Mode". On that #Fightfor15 late JUST LIKE #Her!! 

Please deactivate before she melts down too.
@SenSanders AND NO HOURLY EMPLOYEE WORKING OVERTIME SHOULD B DENIED OVERTIME PAY!!!
@SenSanders then get training and get a better job.
actually people need 2 apply themselves more to get a better job!! I worked hard for my salary, so u want lowskill paid same?
I'm sorry it takes zero skills to flip a burger. It isn't supposed to be a career, it's a JOB.
A job should't keep you needing welfare. I'm glad you love subsidizing corporate profit margins.
falling on deaf ears @SenGillibrand
@SenSanders what if they are only providing $10 p/hr productivity? They won't be hired at all. Zero economic understanding!
That will cost four of my employees their jobs. #cannotAffordIt
really? 1st world problems
Loopholes in labor laws and compliance with current laws would do more than making new laws with new loopholes would do more.
@SenSanders minimum wage is over $16 an hour here in NZ
a teenager waving an advertisement on a street corner does not deserve $15/hr
@SenSanders : Raising mim wage hurts the lower mdl class and imo is pandering for millennial vote.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/11/26/the-facts-on-the-minimum-wage-increase/#748873c952ad …
But let's consider the fact that this won't pass in Trump's version of America. Fight him first.
@SenSanders @Fightfor15LA @People4Bernie the next time they say no, ask them to prove why CEO bonus and share dividends paid?
@SenSanders Min wage not problem. Thinking flippin' burgers lifetime career choice is. Have aspiration & better yourself ++$$
So you're for cutting jobs and hours?
Which hasn't happened in city/states who have already raised it. #RegurgitatingBullshitMakesYouSoundDumb
Why stop at 15, why not $100?  Then everyone would be rich.
@SenSanders then $15 is definitely not enough!
@SenSanders if so the obvious answer is to prevent ceo salaries from being more than 10xs the lowest paid workers wages
@SenSanders perhaps it wouldn't include self employed ie babysitters, dog walkers etc
Can those of us making $115 an hour get a 100% pay increase as well?
Standing for Magic Boats.
The real minimum is $0/hour
@SenGillibrand
No one should live in poverty but an immediate increase will leave many jobless.Gradual increases better for all
This needs to be done gradually, if the min wage is increased to $15, immediately, a lot of companies will fold.
Hmmm... That was precisely what motivated me to go to college. So I'd be worth more.
@SenSanders you people are an economist's nightmare.
I thought I liked you, but after this, I'm unfollowing your account and will never vote for you for any office
Another economically illiterate http://Democrat.One  more reason they lost
Yeah cutting corp tax rates and gutting regulations put us in a recession. We should do a LOT more of that! /s
Thank you for confirming your economic ignorance
raising lowest paid worker to $15 means those above them get a raise too causing prices to increase. So nobody got a raise.
The school tax is killing our seniors  Do something!!
@SenSanders call @POTUS the police are attacking Stading rock and they are losing food now!!!
@SenSanders build your skill set then demand it. You fool.
don't STAND with them..FIGHT FOR THEM!!!
@SenSanders Good way to not get paid minimum wage is to go to college, get educated or complain forever.
@SenSanders of course you are. You're completely clueless about economics and personal liberty
Thank you! Please keep working toward this. It is so difficult..
@SenSanders  Higher min wage makes automation more attractive leading to higher youth and low-exper un-employment. Bad idea!
@SenSanders 
BS!! Gillibrand is a corrupt Centrist troll.  Rest assured, she's helping Wallstreet screw you in other ways.
.@SenGillibrand @SenSanders This is more of an immediate concern that you need to act on now:
This Thursday, the FBI and law enforcement get expanded powers to hack into your computer. Take action to stop them: https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-11-29-urgent-the-fbi-cia-and-other-law-enforcement/ …
Kirsten is Hillary Clinton lite. All talk, no action. See her donors
@SenSanders stand by your man
If Social Security and Medicaid are privatized you had better make that $45/hr #fightfor15
Enforced minimum wage is a zero-sum game. You must understand that.
$15 is too little. Fight for $100 an hour. Nobody in America should earn less than $200k a year.
Now you’re talking. Couldn’t understand why $15 was the magic number when clearly $100 is better.
That’s $100 to start, with 10% raises two or three times a year.
Dude!  Keeps getting better and better. Where can I sign up?
Obama will make an executive order his last day in office.

13 million Families in UK living in poverty...and these are all in work, work literally DOESN'T PAY, why bother
$15.00 an hour is still poor
@SenSanders Clueless.!!! Do the math...why not start at $10 an hour and go from there...#mathalete
You tell that to McDonalds now making automatons to replace employees :P
then they should ask for more than $15/hr.  If I made $15 an hour I'd still be getting health insurance subsidies
@SenSanders we could ensure the entire country a fixed rate of survival and education ability simply by controle federal note
thanks $15/hour...why work and live below poverty

I'm stunned at the responses she is getting. There is do little understanding of people, employment and the economy here!
Whom do you work for again? Oh, right...
@SenSanders for food we have land that need to go green, we need canals to flow the water and pumps to water the land.
@SenSanders Are you certain businesses will accept this without laying off a few workers or inflating product costs?
@SenSanders we could drop electrical cost maybe even make it free
@SenSanders I also believe we have wind mills what if we made a wind generator capable to change position base wind location
