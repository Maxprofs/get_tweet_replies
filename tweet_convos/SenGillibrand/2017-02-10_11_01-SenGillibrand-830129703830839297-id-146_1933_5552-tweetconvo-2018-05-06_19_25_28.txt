Miami based small business owner I'm willing to help get more women elected
We'd love to work with you to get more NY women elected! School board seats across the state are up this year.
this was a big thing for us at our #huddle. We want to know how we can support, too!
Gillibrand in 2020!
I run campaigns. Let me know how I can help you help them get elected!
Any advice on how to get started? Thinking of starting with school board...
same for me.  Thought I would start local.
You're amazing, thank you!
it's truly fantastic!
Our Queen Bee is in the process of searching for how and where to run so we would love for you both to connect!
I am very interested- what should I do first?
I am interested. Not sure where to begin.
You are such an Inspiration @SenGillibrand!!!!  @TheCut
good stuff

I realize @SenGillibrand was 1 of 12 who opposed Kelly, but please can she ensure David Shulkin be pushed through VA?

I'm looking at a local seat on the supervisor board this year so any advice would be appreciated. Filing starts 2/14.
go for it, Traci!
It's in the works as we speak. 
Please endorse me for re-election and my democratic team for Rhinebeck village election March 21
.@SenGillibrand .@TheCut***KRISTEN GILLIBRAND ADMITTED TO PRACTICING WITCHCRAFT IN ORDER TO SEDUCE MEN FOR FINANCIAL GAIN, INCLUDING   !!!
Approval process: ask Gorsuch what he thinks of the Constitutionality of the Senate denying Merrick Garland & how to fix it.
you are a breath of fresh air. It would be a honor to see how I can support and motivate others.

So many people are actually paying attention now & are motivated to make sure this doesn't happen again.
45 might actually make America better.Not by what he does but by the people who come after trying to fix his mistakes
A lot of people took Hillary for granted.
it's funny how all those people who loved to argue w/ me abt her being corrupt are being real quiet now
good for you dear...
Uh Kirsten, you only want extreme leftist progressive socialist. You fight against Conservative and GOP women.
why haven't you donated everything you earned in 2016 to homeless vets?
@emilyslist @TheCut I'm a young mama, and the daughter of immigrants, running in the whitest city in the US. #LetsDoThis
get the party up to speed w the people. Perez/Ellison for DNC co-chairs
@2ysur2ysub
Amazing that this new women's movement wants to be recognized & identified by clothing & hats of fem genitalia.#MilitaryCCaps
THANK YOU for everything you're doing, I'm beyond grateful to have you as my senator!

you and @SenWarren inspire me to FIGHT! #ShePersisted
Inspector of Elections in Pennsylvania!
Go Gillibrand!  and let us know where to follow besides Emily's List
@JaimeeJam  get it
just signed up to volunteer for you 2018 campaign!
.@SenGillibrand  Trump stepped in it via his "nasty woman" mumble. #MAGA will be owned by women, smiling as they win local and high offices.
I was so touched by an interview I heard with you- how Hillary helped you during your path to becoming a Senator. Shine on!
I'm running to be the next City Council member of the 49th District in Staten Island! #hanksforcitycouncil
Trying to round up your own Radical Liberal pu**y posse? American's take note! NYS take note! We need to vote her OUT
my friend @That_Bag_Lady is running for village justice of her village!
The previous election cycle re-invigorated my commitment to action - my vote is mightier when supported by willingness to act
You're lighting the way! This guy's mom was a state rep. I know how hard women work. Want a revolution? Women!
how u can help? Seriously? U haven't done a thing 4 the hundreds of Delphi women constituents that had their pensions stolen
Your negativity against Prez Trump is jaw dropping unfair without merit perhaps you need to reconsider the Senate 
thank you so much for your service to our country! You are a great example. True leadership!!!!!'please RT
could you DM me?
they are too fat to run
You can help by never running for office. Ever. Again.
I will ask for your help to tell me how I can help!
I am! And I will-- I can speak for my patients, I can speak for my community.  #strongnurse #strongwomen
I am interested....Paul Gosar's territory!
@AdrianCJax @TheCut I'm learning
@Donnaphoto @TheCut I'm running for Mayor in a village election that is happening March 21st. I'm in your district! 
Updating documentation on how I built a campaign site using WordPress http://www.electionseason.co  Feedback / questions welcome
Not that surprising when you are one of the inspirations out there. Thank you.
Thank you, you are so awesome ! Appreciate your support and encouragement!
Isn't that gender bias, to support only one of the many genders?
#OffTheSidelines
@1PercenterHater @TheCut Is there a urine test?
:Women=51% of the Nation=high time Conservatives stop act like of man over women=need more in Gov't>end inequity
: No more McConnell censor 1 woman in Senate while ignoring Males did same thing=he got nominee+happy base=pissed off women
I want to! Shut down here in IN. Dem party said wouldn't do anythig to help me when a dem was already in the office. Help.
@Heinzilla We need a big voice. General Strike, February 17th
@AndreaChalupa @TheCut You already help by being such a kick-ass role model for them!  
The best news I've heard all day!
- what a role model! 
Hope you don't teach them how to lie cheat and evade the truth like Hillary Clinton!
, women are ok to run for office, just don't help any #crazyliberal
A definite deterrent to seeking a statewide or federal office is the amount of money it takes to run a campaign.
No man ? :P I feel discriminate :P
Resign your seat and give it to someone competent.
We could use your help in the redder areas of NY! Will you come speak?
@USOWomen @TheCut hey @lkherman, here's a tweet for you!
Hey @SenGillibrand, I rounded up a group of almost 200 people who want to help women get into office. Lmk how we can help!
who are you? Where are you? I want to help too!!!
Strongly considering a run at a Texas House seat in Houston, would be an honor to host an event with you in HTX
What an inspiration you are!
Clone yourself a couple times?!
@JudyBrew66 thank you!
Yassss
Thinking of a local run ... would love Anh advice or support!
I've signed up for info from @emilyslist & class from @VoteRunLead. Ready to change what I cannot accept. What's next?
Gillibrand 2020. A girl can dream...
@MEGBusfield @TheCut will they be wearing vaginas while running?
I'm in! (Need to finish my dissertation & then it's my time!)
I'll run for office if it means I can work with you!
I'm getting #offthesidelines to take down an incumbent. I reached out 2 ur office, never got a reply.
@emilyslist I'm interested but not sure where to start or how to deal with some of pressures. Help is appreciated!
KG if you are in 2020 let me know how I can help.
Gillibrand 2020 for pres
thank you! You are a great example!
no 1 ever brings up Unions as being a Pathway 2 =Pay?  4 women. Dems need 2 get Bk in touch w/unions.  Otherwise both perish
We are trying to start a grassroots movement for replacing Zeldin but don't know how.
read your book. Very inspiring
BBC offers free media training seminars for women in the U.K.  Would love something similar http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/work-in-broadcast/events/expert-women …
would you consider  holding a women's forum with other women officials  to help discuss and build network
If anyone needs a blistering screenwriter/speechwriter I'm here for you
Had never thought I was qualified till this election. Give me a few years. Would love to keep you and hear yr journey
so proud to have you as my Senator.
hopefully they run 2 fix the levels of Lead in the N.Y. water system. Very high levels of Lead in N.Y. water systems.
if trump can be president, anybody, no matter your background, is eligible
Yes eligible, but the real problem is financing a campaign.
I was one of those 500 women at @emilyslist training. Proud to have you as my senator and happy to hear that offer.
Better question: How can we help YOU? Grateful every day for the work you're doing.
.@SenGillibrand With all due respect Senator, it looks awful when a public official offers to help only that half that belongs to her gender
.@SenGillibrand You seem to think that your entire salary is derived only from female taxpayers. But men are also deserving of your efforts.
My friend @LauraforKansas is running to fill Pompeo's seat in Congress. So proud of her!
Can u give me a resource for getting into politics in WI?
I am! Still in uni/working in community leadership roles. Your website is incredibly helpful! Proud to have u as my senator
Connect with She Should Run for comprehensive learning and assistance.
Senator, please talk to @lkherman she's organizing a #getherelected database.
I am considering running for Flake's seat in AZ.
Google She Should Run
I am tired of Democratic votes going down the toilet in AZ.
Reminder: Plz don't get discouraged if you don't win the first time. Incumbents very hard to dislodge. Fight on!
Can you direct me to a resource where I can find more info on how to run?  New to politics, no clue! Very interested tho
Google She Should Run
you are my inspiration! Thank you for setting an example for us on how to succeed and fight!!
you are my senator and I am thrilled to see you working harder than ever for the people!  Please persist in all you do!
The senator from West Virginia has a reason for siding with trump His daughter and wife are involved with epi pen
Glad to see you are willing to assist Republican and Conservative women as well.
This is excellent!
this is so great to hear!  thank you for standing up over and over to the GOP.  humanity is grateful.
I'm off the sidelines! Starting with community and school events, city meetings to better understand the process.
The ONLY adv. of Trump et al. winning is that the bar is set so low that anyone can envision thmslvs doing a better job.
@realDonaldTrump @SteelBackbone Thank U ladies a REAL POTUS can never be one who greets women by shaking them by the Crouch.
@nowhitenonsense @TheCut I've run twice for House here in Idaho. We get zero support from the DNC. We are dying on the vine.
http://sallyharrell.org/ 
Why didn't they vote?
54% of women voted for HRCuneducated white women voted trump other white women voted party line
.@SenGillibrand You go girls! #resistance led by woman!
I'm so happy you represent me.
thanks for being cool
