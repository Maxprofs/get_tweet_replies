Thank you @SenGillibrand! Can't they vote to change the name only since what they really object to is that it was Obama's accomplishment?
if if fails (which might be the republican intent), we must stop calling it obamacare! must refer to it as affordable care...
ACA is awful. You don't want to work on something that works, just tear down alternatives.  #partisan #TermLimits
Has ACA been awful for your family?
no been a blessing saved life of son
Standing up for only the needy. The hell with the citizens who are self sufficient. Thanks! @mfay1957
GOP 'death panels' will be the direct result of this bill
Why don't you ask the state attorney general why he isn't investigating the CLINTON FOUNDATION or GEORGE SOROS
I would like to support you, but this seems more political. My healthcare has increased 10-15% each year & benefits decrease
Were your costs increasing before Obamacare?
Not at the current rate. The problem is not political, its systemic. Intermediaries between people & their docs must be removed
are you talking about the ACA?
if someone wrote up a plan to kill people they would be arrested for terroism whats different put them in jail
Keep up the good work Senator. We believe in you! #Resist #trumpcare #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@ABFalecbaldwin #ConManDon lying about ACA doom to push this smoke & mirror legislation through. Immoral @POTUS
Please say the Dems are working on a repair plan so they have something to contribute. Just standing back is not leading.
They have offered nothing and the sad thing is they know ACA is in a death spiral and if left alone will leave millions w/o insurance.
more left-wing commie BS.
more rt wing crazies
There is no such thing as Trumpcare.
@nhdogmom Hey K, I've said that I don't want my name on the health bill. If you must call it something, call it TrumpDontCare
how the hell did this pass 2 committees? It really needs to be shown to the public. How can we see it?
funny didn't see you fighting against #obomacare #shedidntreadthebill which is a disaster for #America
Has Obamacare made it more difficult for you to get health insurance & healthcare?
no
OBAMA CARE WAS EXTORTION
shoves #Obamacare down our throats and now pretends to give a shit. #Trumpcare Why Democrats are losing in sane states.

SOME PLAN 
Can you amend it to rescind govt healthcare for Congress? I mean if it's so bad ...!!
Thank you, Senator Gellibrand!
Definitely agree so VOTE NO & do everything in your power 2 stop GOP agenda! You have evidence 2 #ImpeachTrump so do it!
.@SenGillibrand I think we've found the one thing that Trump doesn't want to affix his name to. Too bad. He owns it. #TrumpCare.
How many times do I have to say it? If you gotta use my name, It's #TrumpDontCare!!! MAD SAD and BAD.
Tell me how? What's the plan? How can I be effective in battle? #Trumpcare #ny19

I agree it's terrible but isn't the mainstream Republican bill the worse of 2 evils?
Sooo freaking dramatic. Help @POTUS to #MAGA and to #DTS
Have you read the bill? A lot of Republicans don't like it either. It'll kick upwards of 10 mil off insurance
Yes, I read it and it's not up the Federal Govt to guarantee insurance of any kind. #repealobamacare
I'm genuinely interested: what do you see as an alternative? What about those who can't afford insurance?
We still have medicaid for those who truly are destitute.
How do you determine who those people are? What if you have to choose between insurance and food?
We should be looking at health care not insurance. The more govt pays the higher the premiums go.
The more the government pays in subsidies? What's the between insurance and healthcare?
as a disabled older woman, pretty much sure this plan will see me dead. Horrified an saddened.
Please stop "fighting back"! Tired of fighting. Roll your sleeves up and add suggestions. This bill IS changing.Try and help.
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE. TAKE OVER YOUR PARTY AND FIGHT FOR US. IT STARTS NOW.
As your constituent, I ask you to fight for #SINGLEPAYER!  Everybody in, nobody out is the ONLY American value
Please do not let this happen. 
Your fake outrage is too late. ACA is dying under it's own weight. Where is your voice demanding a fix for ACA. U love big gov. Most don't.
why dont u try to pitch in and fix it instead of obstructing? - u have only gop potus who'd w/w dems + ublewit.
Trumpcare is horrible, less coverage , less conditions covered and more money. Punishes the elderly, poor, and sick people.
by "we" you are including yourself correct? Because constituents elect representatives to speak on our behalf
It is true @SenGillibrand It is life & death 4 #cysticfibrosis patients who rely on Medicaid: 1/3 adults & 1/2 kids @CF_Foundation @CFF_GNYC
@jimkoziak Sen we cnt allow for this bill 2 pass! It will literally destroy all the good accompl this bill has brought to HC
yeah, Obama care is going great guns. Should never have been put together like it was. I worked for my health care! Not free!
@ABFalecbaldwin  Wrong loon.
thank you!  Please keep fighting for us!
What can be done when they hold the majority?
Thank you Senator!  Can you please focus on POTUS taxes and Russian connection?  He's a #traitor and should be in jail
call it #trumpdontcare
call it #Republicancare so voters will always remember how much Republicans didn't care.
Yes, or #GOPcare. Republican lawmakers all need to hold responsibility for this travesty.
how can a fight be joined, when Democrats are the minority? Facts, lies, obfuscation rule now.
what's your solution???
I agree. This is an awful bill.
No one is refused care in this country except veterans which is a sin and President Obama only paid lip service too.
@ReginaA1981
'Literally' life and death.... a little melodramatic... Stop the rhetoric!
@SpeakerRyan @SenGillibrand including those of us who accidentally got cancer. #trumpcare is sick  #resist #womensmarch
@puppymnkey So happy you're my family's Senator! I know they're in good hands.
please don't "we have ...". Tell us "how" !
#TrumpDoesntCare you mean
mental health $ cut!! healthy mind=happy healthy productive citizens that don't go around shooting people
A healthy country begins with a healthy mind that raises healthy children that become productive citizens and neighbors
Thank you for your diligence  and please never back down.
we need to do something about mental health treatment   Fee for service NOT WORKING  BAD TREATMENT!
Go after them Sen Gillibrand! All young Dem Senators & Reps should hold a news conf. Jos Kennedy was impressive yesterday
Very concerned Ryan pushing harmful bill, many hit with higher costs or no insurance at all. Concerned Republicans will pass due to pressure
All this but ACA also needed to be fixed. Across state exchanges would have helped.
It sure would be nice if folks bothered to vote in off-year elections.  @SenGillibrand @JeanneFischer33
Stronger words, like MUST fight back, is a start
More than ever, along with every DEMOCRAT politician, that's your job too
what TV network talk shows r u scheduled 4 Looking 4ward 2seeing more from u
@puppymnkey 
Senator, call it what it is.  

#TrumpCare is - 

"Survival of the Fittest" 
on paper!!
disabled Veterans are being ruined by this administration
Keep fighting the good fight, Senator.
can we please call it #Republicare? The @GOP wants Trumpcare so they can blame him when it fails. Let the GOP cont. to sink.
you're a fool..it's part 1 of 3 or let you all fail further. Hard choice but better then you rats. 
You need to clarify: millions of POOR and MIDDLE CLASS Americans will die. 

GOP don't give a damn.
Yes fight back for sure. Or start buying stock in FUNERAL HOMES.  I wake-up every day & check to see if we're all still here
plz reach across the aisle to women Senators (i.e.@lisamurkowski) and explain we do NOT want this.TY, AK Christian voter99515
Why should it be a surprise @GOP cobbled a mess. Only had 7+ years to do "better." @POTUS @RepKathleenRice @ItIzBiz
#Trumpcare=#GopDOESNOTcare  #GOPDoesnotCareaboutKids
We will all go to the mattress on this, or to our Graves fighting for the greater good
Maybe those who support the bill should have to be covered under it?
Dear Senator Gillibrand:  Please make sure that the GOP can't take any action on this until the CBO gives its report.
Thank you so much, Senator!!
#TrumpDoesntCare
- it's called #TrumpDontCare
call it #trumpdeathcare
My access to healthcare is in your hands!
Be productive and offer solutions
With you 1000%
Thanks for representing
I don't even have to look up if you are a Democrat or not; you use just generalities; no specifics. Typical
you did fight back against #Obamacare you didn't even read it before you passed.
maybe can work with Sens Kaine, Capito, Portman, Gardner and Murkowski on something better
UdontListenTo @Potus tooWell.Fact isHisPpl put out a structure to be worked on,AS HE SAID,NowRoll up yourSleves&get to work
Thank you, my Senator, for all you do. Please know that you have our support.
You need to attack, release the bill with comments,notes, and  town hall meetings explaining details. #Trumpcare
No it's not. Ocare had zero impact on life/death. In fact, life expectancy has declined more in states that expanded Medicaid
Please cite sources for stats on relationship between states expanding medicaid and life expectancy.
have the Dems submitted/proposed a resolution to the Trumpcare?
do you think Republican controlled Congress would even hear it? We are diametrically opposed, clearly.
oh please, we still have a voice in Congress
I see the Democrats passing notes under their desks and talking in hushed tones. GOP is using a bullhorn
You shoved a bunch of people on Medicaid, which is tantamount to having no health insurance.
we are behind you all the way.  Thank goodness I live in NY and have great senators
if you live in NY you don't have to worry about health care. They are taxing us to death!
Republican Bill makes us Sick in every way: Physically and Morally
call it #trumpdontcare
