After we take care of our own
They ARE our own!!!
Uh....Puerto Rico is a U. S. territory. The entire island, every resident, all Americans citizens.
No bro u don't get it I'm talkin bout us brothas and sistas come first. We needs focus on. We b American just cuz we black
Garble much?
Just trying to defend Puerto Rico. Have friends there. Sorry my syntax wasn’t up to Twitter standards.
That wasn't directed at you, it was to @JohnyMeyers who, in his attempt to humiliate people of color, botched it.
I agree with you.
Sounds like he’s a true Trumper. Uncle Don blocks every person he doesn’t agree with
What do you call military, ships,supplies that are there working?Roll up your sleeves & go help. Easier to sit & criticize
lets take care of Texas and Florida first...any maybe finish New Orleans?
Exactly.  Time to start ignoring grandpa, give him a remote control and a Dr Pepper, and you guys start working on real issues.
Not Really  Lazy corrupt Island Dwellers, not my countrymen
Congress must act now!! Thank you!!
Then PLEASE don't ignore me+we can save MANY! Help me w/ the red tape in order to get my MD Team to Puerto Rico!Just heard 1 town has 1 DOC!
Jones Act Tru,p just can it #impeachTrumpnow
Please do whatever you can to get Congress to move on this! The situation is dire!
can you speak out about waiving Jones Act?
Congress should have acted already.  Ppl are stranded at airport running out of food/water and ppl are dying in hospitals.
Can Senators mirror House efforts on this??

#PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow
We need the Jones Act to be repealed. Relief cannot wait another moment!
But you know its in the middle of the ocean so there is absolutely no way to get there.
Our situation is critical with no water power or effective communication. The poor and elderly hardest hit. #SOSPuertoRico #wearecitizens
THEN STOP TWEETING AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!
SHE is. The Ijit-in-Chief, OTOH, not so much.
Im not obligated to ANYONE that will not HELP THEMSELVES
Yet PR AND VI WAIT FOR LIFE SAVING NECESSITIES. POTUS HAS NOT CLEANED THE SWAMP.
HE HAS RESTOCKED IT HUUUGELY!!!
VOTE ILK OF THIS KIND OUT!!
Waive the #JonesAct.
Please help us in the fight to waive the Jones Act in this emergency.
I know first hand people Rdying in south + west of the island. My parents from NEW YORK are trapped there! Help! I have 30docs ready 2help.
Very well said, Senator.  Thank you!
Many people don't understand that the people of Puerto Rico are citizens if the United States. 
Apparently including POTUS!
If only Lord Commander Marmalade and/or any of the Republicans in Congress agreed with your absolutely moral and correct stance.
Aren’t you a member of Congress? 
I support this. So what IS Congress going to do?
How is we can forget our responsibilities to our own citizens. Amazing!
@SenGillibrand Then please help me!I'm a doc stuck in Tampa.I need help getting 30 docs out there 2help! Getting blocked! Mdrodri7@gmail.com
It's a damn shame the Republicans wasted so much time on trying to kill OCare, yet again.
Send them the money stolen by the Clinton foundation.
Yes please Senator, ensure Cogress acts as soon as possible in sending aid to P.R., it should not wait till Oct.Thx!
Thank you!
Yes congress act. Trump will not.
What can be done to get the animal out of the white house? He is a clear and present danger to our people and our republic.
Words are good, but swift action is better!!!!  I still haven't been able to to speak to my daughter in Vieques Island, PR!!
SUGGESTION: EVACUATE THE ENTIRE ISLAND.  That will get POTUS' & Congress' attention! Since they're US citizens, no passports, easy breezy.
Senator what have YOU done? Ear marked FED fund request, filed legislation YOU do have  P RICAN  voters It's MORE than just posturing
Don't forget about the US Virgin Islands, please!!
Go down there then
Trump declared a state of emergency there BEFORE the hurricane even hit. We are there but access is difficult.
Suspend the Jones Act!
You are late as always: everything that should be done is done already. That's the response:
 
@realDonaldTrump will ignore it, there are no votes in it for him.
The National guard should get on the ground and check on people! We still do not know who needs help!
THEN DO IT
Sorry, some people are more worried about the NFL...
The actions need to include elimination of the Jones Act. We can't  continue to pay more per item with the unemployment rate we have!
They won't get shit from Republicans / Trump NBA/ NFL make Trump & Republicans see that America & The Flag means more than their words
Why aren't you acting now? What is the hold-up? You all should be ashamed!
Huh?
Absolutely! Now!
Glad to see Senator Gillibrand stepping into the leadership vacuum left by #uBum @realDonaldTrump. Thank you for serving us well, Senator!
What is the Senate doing?
AGREE but @senrobportman had no position or statement about aid to PR as of this morning when I spoke to someone in his office.
#portman
Don't worry puerto Rico/virgin islands #BROWN friends2day is a new dayTues 9/26 #DOTARD racist TRUMP/30% base can no LONGER IGNORE u 
THANK YOU
too many in the gov't right now don't like brown people. it's Genocide by Attrition 
https://glosbe.com/en/en/genocide%20by%20attrition …
Yes! Get going. No time to spare!
Well @realDonaldTrump has been ignoring it for days. Congress must lead on this! #PuertoRico &#PuertoRicoRelief #PuertoRicansAreAmericans
LATIN COUNTRIES MUST HELP CUBA.
FEMA's been there since IRMA, have u not been acting already? POTUS signed disaster declaration long ago. What action have u not taken?
Where is the cavalry ??   Army North....crickets.....
Just more chaos from this administration overlooked by @GOP, if there's a GOD I hope WH & everyone inside feels the next cat 5 personally
Yes and one can still have hope that @realDonaldTrump uses whatever executive powers he has to do something to help
repeal the Jones Act.
But what about NFL players taking a knee during the National Anthem?

#25thAmendmentNow 

#ImpeachTrumpPenceNOW
Make Puerto Rico habitual again
Obviously, Trump can totally ignore it.
FEMA is there
Not doing much: https://www.facebook.com/108679513654/videos/10155189553023655/?hc_ref=ARRtvPPXQn-dHdTli0AInw96fkHjlt5oHdEF9_SRF4WusDn5dok9tYmyIgr-wcl5yow …
Everyone on here PLEASE CALL your Senators and Congressmen get Navy ship COMFORT down 2 Puerto Rico now. They can anchor SHIP 1/2mile off
Ma'am please get the US naval ship Comfort down to Puerto Rico. Trump has it sitting in Norfolk doing nothing. Please help save them! PLEASE
It doesn't appear enough support has been provided. They definitely need more help, especially in food supplies & personnel.
Make a push for full statehood. Won't pass, but make them say no
So get off twitter and go do something- it's your job.
That's what we kept saying about failing O Care!! They need to repeal and replace like McCain has been saying for yrs. Lies!!
Meanwhile Twitler attacking NFL hero's and busy gouging us with golf cart rentals.
It's your obligation to provide justice and equality for all so lock up Hillary Crooked Clinton, a pathological liar is not above the law!
PR needs to be exempted from the Jones Act, permanently, as are the USVI already. This will greatly aid recovery.
@ChelseaClinton @nytimes
No.  Our obligation now is to solve a major issue, the 'kneeling'  of #Football players.  #EllenDegeneres 
POUTUS with his comments seem kick them while they'redown.
Sounds like @POTUS thinks it's all their fault! Also, that it's an island surrounded by a very big ocean. So...
Then support the Bill in the House post haste, without strings or political spin
Tell them to take a knee that usually gets Trump these days. Not people suffering.
Get off your butt and do something!
Yes. They should. But did you know it is an island in a big ocean?
Trump on delivering aid to Puerto Rico: "This is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. It’s a big ocean, it’s a very big ocean." 
That's my senator! 
About time  a US Senator spoke up about the crisis in Puerto Rico, even though some IGNORANT A..holes are saying they are not  U.S.A
waive Jones Act restricting other countries from helping to aid PR!! They need water, now and help for at least 16 months.
PLS DO all you can to help these Folks ASAP can @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems work on their own to do this. @MSNBCRachel @chrislhayes
@ChelseaClinton @nytimes @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @CIA @SecretService @IvankaTrumpHQ @VP @SpeakerRyan @ParisHilton
 #YOLO 
@gop leadership @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP immediately funded aid, support packages & supplies are landing hourly for #peurtorico
We're afraid Trump will start a war
He attacks #NFLPlayers & more
What if it's all just a show?
To distract from #Healthcare & #PuertoRico!
Can Congress activate the military for immediate assistance? A military airlift of generators, fuel, and supplies?
We can't wait for Congress. It's on us to push this cause forward. Show your support:
Thank you!
Trump says he can't go till Tuesday,  to much golf scheduled this weekend?
Senator, r president is to busy worrying about the flag to care about the citizens of the US. This man has no priorities, and is a fool
Please work to do this, Senator!
Wait Kristen they speak some Spanish, and Republicans are racists
Democrats are, always have been the racist hateful party. Know your history.
Please tell me how can I help.

Gofundme gets a %. Not cool. NO RED CROSS. They are terrible.
One of my reps tweeting about PR. Please, commit to support immediate assistance!!
Navy is on the shore, air force in the air. President declared disaster.  WTF is congress doing?
Load everyone in the airport into some 747's and send to ATL or other US hub and they can transfer from there.  Can do in 1 day!
So what is Congress waiting for? Every day it critical. Get this done please!
Won't happen. Trump already "blasted" Puerto Rico and he is too busy defending his ego with the NFL!
I'm a NYS resident with two grandkids in Puerto Rico. That island deserves our help.
Know airports/ports important but C130s can literally make supplies drops between buildings;ospreys can be fitted with tanks-We can do this!
#MakeGettingHelptoPuertoRicoAPriorityNow
We must all act. This is not their crisis, it is ours. Do something:
I am confused because if senators are saying "congress must act" but senators ARE congress, what are we waiting for? Godot? God? Who?
Well said. This is what you pay them for.
Thank you @SenGillibrand - keep fighting 4 what is right - it is disgusting that we have to ask for help for #PuertoRico but we do #DOTARD
Send the Hospital Ship as well as fuel, water and food!
Bend the knee maybe the President will notice
Parenthetically: Elect more women to Congress -- they're saving our bacon, right left & center.
Congressional action is an oxymoron
And what are you doing about it besides tweeting?
Look, Trump's just dealing with those kneelers at the moment. He'll get round to less important stuff later. OK?
@SenateMajLdr do something!
nah, you want war more then helping the world. and of course drugs from afghan
Where is Chelsea Clinton's donation?
We can't because you are resisting too much. Why not take all the $ you are giving to help the illegals & help with that. NY taxes too high
I vote we give all of #PuertoRicoRelief a free #Obamacare med card....with no guaranteed "HEALTHCARE" included. Compassionate? No??
@frostpixie5 we can't but Trump will #Truth
Sen Gillibrand - much respect!!

Can you find out why exactly response is so slow compared to TX & FL? I’m sure USVI still needs help too
Because the illustrious one is too ignorant to realize they are American citizens.
WH per spox to "get the ball rolling" in October?  These people need more help now, not in a month.  People are dying.
Thank you for the truth.
Agreed!
Do something.  Now.  This is an outrage.
Go get them, Kirsten!!!  #PR cannot afford to cover any fed grant local match - they need 100% aid!!!
Agreed! Please encourage people to call/email the US Gov to demand they do more to help Puerto Rico & USVI.
One helpful thing the Senate can DO NOW is pass S.1561, @SenJonMcCain's bill to repeal the outdated and recovery-crippling Jones Act.
#PuertoRicoRelief Absolutely, Puertoricans are US Citizens and as a USA territory our government has the obligation to help them
#PuertoRicoRelief or WE can ask the @eu_eeas or the @UN because the way the #DonaldTrump administration acts is like they don't care
#PuertoRicoRelief USA citizens are going to die on delayed help from our government, they can't wait for the president to stop tweeting
#PuertoRicoRelief about the fucking #NFL  @NFLEspanol @NFL
Senator we need the military to airlift Americans out of #PuertoRico. The airlines are not helping!
Supplies and donations aren’t getting to #PuertoRico due to airlines refusal to as Federal government permission to fly to PR. https://twitter.com/prinforma/status/912539328110366721 …
Thank you! Will you be proposing or co-sponsoring an aid package? What process is required?
Seems as if the GOP is far too busy trying to kill American here not realizing people in Puerto Rico literally are going to
Yeah!  Republicans are....Hitler!  Rapist!!  No.. THE DEVIL!!!  #HyperboleMuch??
Please Congress some one had got to run this country! Help these people put the lights on!
This needs to be the #1 priority of Congress right now
Well done! #NYunitedforPuertoRico
There is no benefit to trump plus they are hispanics to he isn't going to push for anything
Trump admin is intentionally not helping. Congress owned by Kochs..complete Dereliction of Duty.  America is being intentionally ruined.
Hey genius trump already did. It's congress that needs to act
Thank you!
