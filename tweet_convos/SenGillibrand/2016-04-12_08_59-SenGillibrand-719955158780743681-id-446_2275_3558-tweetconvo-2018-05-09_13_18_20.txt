@HillaryClinton Close the gap? then encourage Women to make better career choices, like you did
@orniastic @HillaryClinton It has nothing to do with career choice. A woman in the exact same position as a man will typically earn less.
@DustyJep @orniastic @HillaryClinton woman here.  Been in tech for 30 years.  Always got paid same as men.
@thundermom26 @DustyJep @HillaryClinton you prove the point being made,career choice is the difference between gender pay gaps
@orniastic @DustyJep @HillaryClinton Yes, career choice, choice of not working extra hours, choice of taking off for years to raise kids.
@thundermom26 @DustyJep @HillaryClinton again due to rigorous maternity laws in UK & US that argument is bogus but loving your victimhood
@orniastic @DustyJep @HillaryClinton not a victim at all.  Pay gap is a myth.  People make choices.
@thundermom26 @orniastic @HillaryClinton Many times people don't get a choice. #GenderRoles #GlassCeiling I tend to side with the studies.
@HillaryClinton What's your plan? As Secretary of State you were posed to help women of the world with this, what did you do? #EqualPayDay
let's close that gap!
@HillaryClinton  if their doing the same job it's wrong but most are not  let's tell the truth
@HillaryClinton stop lying!
@HillaryClinton WOMEN cost 30% more in HEALTHCARE COST 
meaning MEN have to PAY HIGHER TAXES to subsideise Women's health cost 

NOW WHAT
@kristinas_town @HillaryClinton 100%
So for that reason that cost more.

MEN do jobs most women can't So that's why they get paid more
@kristinas_town u want everything that men and women do to be 100% fair

OK
Let's have Women die on the front lines of a War like Men do
@HillaryClinton Start talking about how people in power make so much more than everyone else...

@HillaryClinton My life experience tells me women are paid higher for equal work and do a shittier job. Just telling my truth.
@HillaryClinton The women at the Clinton Foundation earn 38% less than man. Start at home.

Women earn just $0.79 for every $1 men do. It's worse for women of color. Let's close that gap. #EqualPayDay -H

@HillaryClinton Why don't you set the example by instituting equal pay at the Clinton Global Initiative?
@HillaryClinton Thanks for fighting for women and families!
@HillaryClinton first of all not true in the sense u want  it to be,  second were u paid same as secretary for all the damage u did?

@HillaryClinton Haitians were making poverty wages, yet your state dept killed a democratically voted on min wage for them. Hypocrisy.
@HillaryClinton You should know, you paid women on your staff less than men

@HillaryClinton COUNT ME IN!!!!
@HillaryClinton says the woman who paid women in her state department less than men...  Glass houses
@HillaryClinton Why do male executives at the Clinton Foundation make 38% more than female executives there?
.@HillaryClinton #RiddleMeThis If women are less expensive to hire compared to men, then why don't employers just hire women to save money?
@HillaryClinton gender card!
@HillaryClinton women are favored 95% of the time in child support/alimony payments and earn 40 times more than men in sexuality jobs.
@HillaryClinton @ElisabethRohm This really is why you should talk to an economist instead of a politician.
@HillaryClinton Even the wash post exposed $.79 as a HUGE hoax, not taking into account hours worked long term absences and hazardus job pay
@HillaryClinton @ElisabethRohm get a life already
@HillaryClinton WHY DID THE DEMOCRATS LET THIS HAPPEN???
@HillaryClinton angry with this income gap. Change must come 
@HillaryClinton Obama did say the same thing. He also said he was there to say we will not we should fill the gap.

@HillaryClinton $.79 is an average of all jobs, and men work more higher paying jobs. Pay difference due to bias is about one or two cents.
@HillaryClinton Perhaps if you switched from a feminist dance major to petroleum engineering, that'd help.
