@SenateDems u all lose midterm We the ppl who voted for trump want this ban we want those who want to kill us gone & ilegals
When will the light come.  We are the worst state in the union.  Why do you think that we had a population decline last year?
this is straight out of Hitler's playbook.  If I can see this so can others
who gives a crap your a obstructionist who is looking to be president

thank you for your integrity and courage
Thank you for all you are doing to stand up for our rights! Let's keep fighting - from Brooklyn, NY
@SenSchumer When you answer the question I'll stop asking it. Did you express all this moral outrage over Obama's refugee ban
@1jamiebell how about you go to work and confirm cabinet. That's your job.
@SenateDems @DNC Gillibrand must run in 2020! "HILLARY 2: DAWN OF THE PAST!" What fun. We never see her in Rochester NY.
omg another of my  heroines Kirsten i love ya
@SenateDems  After YEARS of Republicans ONLY voting NO on President Obama's legislation you MUST stand firm on NO to Trump.
I am disappointed with you.  He is doing exactly what he was elected to do.  I am ashamed of my state.
Thank you New Yorkers for standing up  for American values

@SenateDems  Delay vote on Tillerson. Demand he return to answer ?'s RE: #NoBanNoWall #BanBannonNSC & Gaz 19% sale
what hypocrisy. Where was all this outrage when Obama banned Iraqi refugees for 6 months in 2011
how many refugees have you personally welcomed into your home?
@SenateDems  it's time to give these assholes some of their own medicine they. Want to kill Americans by repealing ACA
Thank you!
Thank you senator #choosehumanity
I beg someone to answer this - how is this different than the 6 month Obama ban of Iraq in 2011? Did we not care about them?
Go ahead stand and protest for everything against America's safety. Stop putting America last!
Let's see if you rhetoric can ramp this up into full blown riots. Wall Street protesters needed something new to protest.
Vote against Jeff Sessions and ALL Trump's nominees.
I wish you were so passionate about helping our homeless vets.
that order is exactly what we need and is undeniably constitutional.  Get with the program or resign!
to bad you didn't do this for the Sandy victims you ignored them for a few months made a quick statement then ignored again
As much as I'd like to see Michelle or Kamahla run in '20, I think you'd be great too! I'm not a NY resident but I thank you!
