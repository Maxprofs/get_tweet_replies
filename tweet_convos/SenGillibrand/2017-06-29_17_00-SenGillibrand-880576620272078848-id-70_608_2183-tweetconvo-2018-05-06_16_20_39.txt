Indeed we do! 
How come you haven't authored any important Senate bills since you were elected ?
She's stupid!
And you my dear have the power to sicken people with your obstructionist attitude.

Welcome Wesley. Bill here. #healthyfaith
Hello Bill. Hope your handle continues to grow.
I certainly WANT to believe.
Don't mind the bots Senator.  The ones that have very few followers or r new and r rude
Do not let them Repeal and Replace. They will execute 1 and then leave us all to die.
Don't believe a politician EVER. Push for Convention of States for term limits.
Thank you, thank you. Please keep lifting up Americans that feel defeated by this disaster.
If there is no oversight of voting machines how will that happen?
Agreed. I don't have faith in our democracy right now.

Same holds true for you Senator. You have to power to work with the Republicans.
You like to talk tough and drop the F bomb. But then play the victim when the going gets tough. You can't have both ways.
We know. We elected @POTUS !! #MAGA
Need to converge at The Hill & WH
I do believe the cynics but still try to get out there & change outcomes. You never know. Thanks for supporting Medicare for all.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Please help rid the white house of the goons and the orcs!

Today GOP:

Defunded fed agency protecting against vote hackingâ€¦
Kirsten, even though you're an unscrupulous opportunist, I really like that you're in favor of single-payer healthcare
Agreed! Single payer, free college, ending drug war & interventionist wars, & policing Wall Street possible if we elect the right people.
We The People have all the power when we stand united!
Yes! Only in voting and by taking action can we the American ppl foresee change, and actually make it come to fruition. #Valles2020
Wrong! Nice try! Get to work!
Aspire to be... and make it happen!

You have the power to vote yes for Kate's Law and hold sanctuary cities accountable
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." ~M. Mead
You'd be a great president.
A big complaint I hear from friends, family, & operatives in NY is the inability to change national outcomes with stable national reps
Preach, woman! 
THIS!  Cynicism and apathy are servants of the status quo.
Can we have a Boston Tampon Party? No taxation w/o representation? Pleeeaaasssseeeee.....? #Resist #Persist Don't let them shut you up.
Kirsten, I am discouraged. I am sad. I know this is the white man's final cheer. What fresh hell is this?
Its growing pains. Ultimately healthy, short term painful and a huge test of our individual resilience, optimism, strength, wit,  empathy.
Yes please run!! #Gillibrand2020
You have the power to try him in the Senate. Dems need the House and call for Impeachment.
Thank you Senator.
A trump supporter being the purveyor of graceful behavior is comical
