If women really want equality, they have to be big girls and play by the rules. She broke rules.There are consequences
she did exactly what 4 make colleagues did and not a word was said to the men...
You know Coretta Scott King thanked AG Sessions right? Of course you don't #clueless
Speaking of two brave women, how about a Warren/Gillibrand ticket in 2020? @SenWarren
no not just 2 brave women, by doing this it's ALL women! We need to take action. I'd like to see more rallies and protests.
Remember when Coretta Scott King congratulated your new Attorney General of the United States?
Stop using your gender as a crutch of you want to play with big boys you better not whine like a snowflake!
We need you to a demand for public apology from @SenateMajLdr
I guess even women have to follow the rules. What is the world coming to!
Warren, an amazing voice for socialism. I hope she runs for president.
, can't wait until 3/1 for Women's History Month. It will be so interesting this year. I wonder who #45 will insult..
they accepted it's call keep talking & arrest my ass.
I find this appalling & disrespectful. Sen. Mitch McConnell shows his prejudice in his treatment people.
so you believe @SenWarren is above the rules of the Senate?
examining a person's character flaws at a debate over a person's character?
no, smearing a sitting fellow senator while on the floor of the senate. Big difference.
