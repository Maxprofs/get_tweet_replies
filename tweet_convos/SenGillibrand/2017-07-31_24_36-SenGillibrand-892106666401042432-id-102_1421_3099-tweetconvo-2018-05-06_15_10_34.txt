Trigger warning, the wage gap does not exist. Please stop spreading rumours.
WMP has struck again!
This will help explain the #BlackWomensEqualPay myth. Choices in this world unfortunately have real consequences. 2>1
Thx 4 reminding me men dont suffer their half of the consequences for getting women pregnant. Lets penalize unmarried men at same rate. ?
I don't quite get what you're hinting at. Could you explain?

This discrepancy must be addressed and repaired. No one should have to live below the poverty level in this country in 2017.
Better education helps. Not having kids before marriage helps
Ignorance is bliss
At least Obama gave them a free phone.
That is so terrible.
U think Obama would have helped them
That applies to @HillaryClinton' staff as well right?

Does that include education and everything else ?

You're dead. Get back in the crypt
Earning gap, not wage gap. Stop with your constant lying, the gig is up.
When you become Black, female and walk in my shoes, you can talk.  Until then, hush bcuz you know nothing of which you speak.
Truth is after a certain age no one has affirmative action.
But like overall wage gap, this number is largely a myth. I believe there is a small but significant wage gap. Using fake #s does not help.
Another white guy telling me what being black & female's like n America.  U who R deemed privileged by the color of your skin need 2 b quiet
I support efforts to equality - I think these fake nums make things worse, tbh.  Just like the overall "77 cent" wage gap.
Like I said.  When U turn black, w/ 3 a BA & 2 masters degrees & can't find a job, we can talk.  Until U walk in our shoes, silence's best.
I am disputing these "wage gap" numbers that misrepresent the issue.
You don't know.
The issue is real. The stat is misleading. That's been my point all along.
You sure are fond of spreading hateful lies!
Very interesting now there is a concern for the welfare and salaries of #POC. I am a Dem & where have the Dems been for 53 years (my age)?
Pander them votes
The Equal Rights Amendment in the Constitution is the ultimate legal argument to end sex discrimination. Cosponsor SJR 5 now.
Question... are the same professions being taken into account? Where can we find the information on what exactly is being compared?
Yep. Start with the loudest complainer - HRC and Sen. warren.  They pay their women less then their male counterparts
I think Hispanic women are there also, if not lower
September 25 is their wage gap day
@SenGillibrand as I replayed to @KamalaHarris you to must broaden your prospective to include all women of color when raising these issues
In fact I'll go so far as to say that a women's physical appearance also plays a role and that needs fixing also
The fixing needs to happen in the minds of those hiring.
Pass the ERA
Let's start by giving them a quality education. Something you are opposed to because you get money from teachers unions.

Are you suggesting we force them to take on overtime and danger pay jobs? That's awfully close to slavery.
Kirsten & team, please read "Under the Bus" by Caroline Frederickson with  political legislative history of wage gap.  How to change. - Cat
Achieving a promotion may cost you your job.
"That affects everyone" of those black women. *Fixed*
Tell me something I don't know already.
would like to see if that is in relation to fields they pick. know lot of women who enter helping fields. And this country doesnt pay those.
Fox shit forever.
At 63 cents to the dollar, only black women would be getting hired for the same skill set. What a load of BS.
@dnc, if the men leading the party want to backseat issues like wage equality and voter suppression, hand over the reigns.
You're utterly incapable of understanding even the simplest dynamics, huh? Wages are based exclusively on choices made. Not race.Not gender.
Don't want to work overtime? You get paid less. Don't want to take on danger pay? You get paid less.
Spent less time training? Paid less. Want to prioritize family over work? Paid less. 

All of these reductions are 100% fair.
If I'm risking my ass on an oil rig for 50 hours a week you're damned straight I'll make more than a part time Walmart greeter. Fucking duh.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Pay_Act_of_1963 … Seriously. I'm not even slightly kidding. Read the entry.
Good jobs and adding skills will be good for all of us. I have made 0 cents for the 10 years.
I wondered about this, thanks for sharing. May we truly embrace equality
So what r u doing abt the wage gap amongst Black women and white women?
It's pretty impressive you were elected despite being obviously horrible at economics. We'll be working to change the elected part soon
Maybe hire all them for Senate then, right? Or for every job, since apparently this happens and is legal. These "facts" are so idiotic.
Remove #affirmativeaction so that we can all be back on the same level. That way the smart black women will raise because they r worthy
Well when u get through school on affirmative action the corporate company will expose your worth. #BlackWomensEqualPay
What is that figure for white and Hispanic women vs white men ?
Shameful
That's the symptom not the disease. Fix education and get rid of bad teachers. Make equal standards for college admissions. They can compete
Paying people less because of their race/gender has been illegal since the 70s
Why don't they just identify as white men?
Lol. So much bullcrap.
This is crazy blowback for stating the truth. From the military to gun control & issues of equality, your representation is stellar.
It's like living in Canada ( 70 cents )
Thank you Senator Gillubrand for being courageous to talk about the same old thing that has bn going on for decades.  Will it ever change?
another tool of whites hold our sister down @oneunited @moreHOUSE @usedgov minority businesses @unitedway #mediamatters stir

Oh ok. What have you done for them?! Got it. Next bandwagon is......
Perhaps the highest teen pregnancy rate is more the root cause than employers or sexism? But that wouldn't serve an agenda.
More than Trump pays hires. Refusal to pay Lucky you'll get 25 cents to the dollar
Dumpy Corrupt Trumpy all GOP Reps voting ACA repeal
That's why President Trump is bringing back better jobs! You're a Senator, you should know this. If you really care you would work with him!
Why not provide some statistics relative to their education, experience & background. I would suggest the message is union schools failed!
Curious as to why I never see black female engineers. Statistically, there are very few.
That's easy.

I went to college for engineering. There was one white woman in class and a few black guys. Most were white guys. That's why.
You're a liar.
Thanks for highlighting the lower figure. This is important. #MindTheWageGap
Kirstie, babe, surely yer yankin' ma crank!
What did your Messiah do about that for the 8 years he was in office. Did you just discover this Tina?
Sad indeed
Weren't you in Congress when the democrats controlled the house, senate, and pres? Now you have to pander for votes. U R pathetic.
DISINGENUOUS crap. Liberal 101
If women are that cheap, why would anyone hire a more expensive man? I could hire 3 women for less than 2 men. Sounds like a deal!
oh rly? How about some sources
It’s an earnings gap, not a wage gap.
And when we speak up, we are often punished for it!
Why does Oprah make so much then?
You have been in congress long enough to have done something about this #action speaks louder then your tweets
What type of jobs are they doing ? Education ? Experience? lot of factors effect wage
To those woman who don't make as much as men!
If you and @KamalaHarris feel that not enough is being done, THEN give half of your $175,000 salary to a foundation that will distribute it!
Why would they give half of their pay ?  That's makes no sense. You're an embarrassing dolt.
The prison system is institutionally biased. At 6.7%, women are underrepresented in US prisons.

There should be no wage gap! If, anything minimize that gap as much as possible. #Valles2020 #KeepItRealAmerica
Women aren't paid less for the same job. They're paid less for different jobs. Men don't force them to take diff. career paths.
You Marxists just won't stop pushing for equal outcomes through government pressure
Cite your data.
What do we do? Talk to trump? We're dead
This year, Native American women equal pay day is 9/25 and Latina equal pay day in 11/2, according to NOW
Says a rich white woman?

Dear christ Democrats are shameless.
Where's your data source to support this ?
They don't have one
