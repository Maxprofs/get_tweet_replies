Amazing. @SpeakerRyan turns off House cameras, so @cspan airs Periscope/FB streams of @repjohnlewis sit-in protest! http://www.c-span.org/video/?411624-1/watch-house-democrats-continue-house-sitin-gun-violence …
Meanwhile, the Senate votes again today to warrantlessly monitor your web activities, expand PATRIOT Act. Stop them.
Fascinating politics going down: Senate vote on warrantless web surveillance, House sit-in protest on gun violence, EU referendum (Brexit).
Been listening to amazing, heartfelt oration about gun violence at House sit-in. Bearing witness to public servants. http://www.c-span.org/video/?411624-1/watch-democrats-continue-house-sitin-gun-violence …
Wow. A protest song from the 1960s Civil Rights Movement was not what I expected of the House today. #NoBillNoBreak
History being made on the House floor. Led by @RepJohnLewis, we sang "We Shall Overcome." #NoBillNoBreak
What's discouraging is that everyone, on both sides, is peddling fundamentally flawed legislation, even when I agree with the spirit of it.
Better gun control? Needed. The sit-in? Significant. This "no fly" gun bill? A frustrating "civil rights disaster."
Can't improve immigration because #SCOTUS is 4-4 and Senate won't consider nominee. House won't even vote on gun control bills. Also, Trump.
@aj_simonton @ScottPetersSD Political theater. Nothing more.
more "theater" means more coverage and more pressure to act.
If Lewis wants reform, he should work with R's to find a compromise. A sound bite is less work.
I think it's pretty clear that Republicans don't want to act let alone compromise.
I don't believe that. The issue is the integrity of the terror watch/no fly lists.
@MoniquePressley It's better than marching at this junction in life.
Long over due don't you think.
@ScottPetersSD Some uv "US" have to stand up,to prevent all this senseless killing
@AneesaSM @ScottPetersSD Its is a useless vote, on a bill that is not helpful
@iamrashidajones @ScottPetersSD Democrats blocked two bills already. Why not pass one of those?
rather than having a gun vote every few years, can 2nd amendment be repealed by 2016 referendum?
hold the floor Democrats...
@HouseDemocrats You and our fellow democrats are heroes! #NoBillNoBreak #NoMoreSilence Show @NRA how it's done! So proud.
Add defund PP and you have my attention. @repjohnlewis @LeslieMarshall @ScottPetersSD

@LeslieMarshall @ScottPetersSD
LOL, chirp, chirp chirp, chirp those are the crickets chirping because no one is listening to you.
You are my hero. A national treasure and a good man with integrity and courage few people display.
@ScottPetersSD ... Dems had more than enough time to pass MORE gun control Laws from 2008-2012. What were they up to then?
@ScottPetersSD  yes cause sitting on the floor is leadership and not acting like a 2 yr old! Haha childish morons.

@HouseDemocrats You already had a vote and you voted "NO" to H.R. 2578: To Secure our Homeland from radical Islamists. WHY?
What they once did with billy clubs, they now achieve through indifference. You are a fighter. The cause is just. Thank you.
@HouseDemocrats You rock, Cong Lewis! Thank you for your leadership to act now on gun control! Stay comfortable on House floor
Mr. Lewis, that feed ended. We would like to bear witness. Not sure if @ScottPetersSD is allowed to keep feed up. #goodtrouble
