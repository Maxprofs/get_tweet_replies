What about Orlando, Fl?
Hi. You can text SHELTER and your zip code to 43362 (4FEMA) - std msg/data rates apply. Web: http://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter …
Thank you.
FEMA has an app? TIL
We do! https://www.fema.gov/mobile-app 
Since when?
Its evil not to except pets@shelters. That's whats worrying me the most about having to ride out the storm. Not going to leave my little boy
I wouldn't leave my baby, either. I'd go down w/ the ship rather than leave my cat behind. BTW, cute kitty you have, there.
Yep, it sad that they make people choose between their fur babies or their own safety in emergencies like this! & thanks, he's a sweetheart
I have no children & my pets ARE my children.I once put myself between an unleashed Akita & my cat. I was willing 2 take the bullet for him
My cat is my child too&we've been through a lot together. Keep your fingers crossed for us in Tampa! &good you keeping your baby safe!
Wishing you the best w/ the hurricane. I've been to the Tampa area. really nice. Keep the kitties safe!
Thank you! We're all ready to ride it out and have backup plans in place. Pet friendly shelters are within a 20 minute drive thankfully.
Best of luck to you & your babies.
Will Lakeland be effected or evacuated?
Hi Margie, please listen to your local emergency management agency for instructions on if, when, and how to evacuate.
Thank you. It is my father-in-law who lives in Lakeland. He refused to evacuate because he has no records for his dog. Praying...
And if you only have a computer and not a mobile phone?
You can check local emergency management websites & social media accounts, or the Red Cross website: http://ow.ly/AFqX30f1fTM 
Thought those were tornadoes!
Thank You 
Didn't see where @oliviawilde is opening her homeup to refugees of the storm

FEMA, please talk to Polk County Sheriff about endangering lives by threatening to arrest people for minor violations and immigration.
Why don't we see contra flow traffic on evacuation?? Open up those southbound lanes for traffic north. Leave one lane for south!
I've been asking that of many people here in FLA. No answer. They did it in NY w/Sandy.
See those people at Gandy Bridge going down to the shoreline to look at the water receding?
Lucky to get my twins going to school down there out of south Florida just in time, so sad, prayers for all
Thanks but Trumps got this.
Mar a Lago? Unpresidented

@Jessitoburrito
@missmiameo !!!
DONT FALL VICTIM TO TRUMPS BS
If people evacuate without their pets can you sent them back in to save them?  Take your pets or don't evacuate.  Should be a law
don't trust anything you see or hear on TV or on radio or on the internet
@DaSaucyJ_49
 #irma
FEMA= concentrated camps
saying that, if these persons have the Internet.
I pity and pray all evacuees in FEMA shelter west of St Pete. Deadly wind plus storm surge there... What the heck?
So this is the new world order...
Check out @Space_Station’s Tweet:
The space station flew over Hurricane Jose at 10:10 a.m. EDT today and over Hurricane Irma at 11:40 a.m. EDT today. 
Best of luck Tim @timfargo @alphabetsuccess
Stay safe
Tell ppl to take their pets too, not board them in a clinic forcing those employees to risk their lives to stay to protect other ppl's pets
