@SenThadCochran   I THINK YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT WE PUT YOU IN OFFICE, WE CAN ALSO SEND YOU A PINK SLIP AND SEND YOU HOME...
@SenThadCochran   YET SENATOR YOU VOTED TO GIVE HARRY REID THE POWER TO STRIP THE DEFUND PROVISION AND FUND OBUMMER CARE,
@SenThadCochran Looks like you may not see another reelction after this. Correct yourself fast. you are heading downhill from here.
@SenThadCochran And to think my family knows you.... Atkinsons and the WARRENS from the DELTA. Yet you would pull this stunt. defund it!
@SenThadCochran No. You agree that you are FREE of it. You voted against the DEFUNDING. MS and TN agree to defund and you went against us.
@SenThadCochran You voted for cloture.  That gave the Dems their way.  You aren't standing firm against Obamacare.  You just appear to be.
@SenThadCochran You lie, sir. My late father-in-law who supported you in Harrison county turned in his grave when you gave Reid cloture.
@SenThadCochran Right. You want to over turn O-care but you voted with Harry Reed for cloture... Want it both ways.  Up for re-election 2014

@SenThadCochran nice vote Lefty. You let Reid win. You're done as a senator. We will be voting you out. Might as well announce retirement
@SenThadCochran your vote for cloture WAS a vote for Obamacare. You no longer have my vote come election time. #MakeDCListen
@SenThadCochran Just speak the truth Senator, if you can't stomach a fight just speak just say so. But do not treat us like fools.
@SenThadCochran A careplan made by the Magnates who control the Fed.Reserve, IRS, insurance companies, MIC &obama.
@SenThadCochran  Ted Cruz stood for all us, our rights as a republic while u chose 75% subsidies from a broke  nation.
@SenThadCochran Yeah, and if we are still a free nation, next election, I will overturn my neg. vote for u.
@SenThadCochran your constituents were not represented. You sided with the Bankers. U sold us out for your own rewards.
@SenThadCochran Sorry Thad, you blew it. Your whole party blew it. You're a loser.
@SenThadCochran we know how you voted yes to cloture. and we will not forget during your next election
@SenThadCochran we will vote you out along with wicker

@SenThadCochran Most disappointed with today's vote.
@SenThadCochran What U voted 4 was Cloture with Harry Reid & Obama.  Ur constituents R smart & will not forget. #Traitor
@SenThadCochran Please retire. You sold us out as has most of the GOP.  I have always voted a straight GOP Ticket. No more.  #JUDAS

@SenThadCochran A True Conservative: State Sen. Chris McDaniel @senatormcdaniel https://www.facebook.com/senatormcdaniel?fref=ts …
@SenThadCochran apparently you think your fellow Mississippians are idiots. I guess you ckd ur character and integrity at DC's door.
@SenThadCochran why did you vote FOR cloture? #StandYourGround #MakeDCListen
@SenThadCochran THEN WHY DID YOU VOTE YES ON CLOTURE WITH HARRY REID?? YOU JUST VOTED TO FUND OBAMACARE!! RECALL AND REPLACE.
@SenThadCochran Your words don't square with what you did, gave Dems 51 vote advantage. RU that stupid? We are not fooled. #TeaParty
@SenThadCochran A vote for cloture was a de facto vote for #obamacare. #wewillremember #makedclisten
@SenThadCochran if you agree that it needs to be over turned then why did you vote to fund it?
@SenThadCochran get a clue, Senator - IT'S LAW
@SenThadCochran you are pathetic and we are not fooled for a minute #rino
@SenThadCochran you did not vote against defunding Obamacare. As a Mississippi voter, we are not stupid.
@SenThadCochran Thank you for standing for the AMERICAN PEOPLE!
@SenThadCochran thank you senator Cochran... Keep up the fight to #DefundObamacare Dont give up until it is abolished!
