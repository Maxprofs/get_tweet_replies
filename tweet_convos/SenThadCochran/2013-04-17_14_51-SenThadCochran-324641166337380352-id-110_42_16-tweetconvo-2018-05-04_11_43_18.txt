@SenThadCochran We're gonna make sure people vote against your failed job as a Senator.
@SenThadCochran wow, you should be ashamed of yourself. Imagine one of those newtowne kids was one of your grand kids. You are pathetic
@SenThadCochran #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction
@SenThadCochran  Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? ... http://tmi.me/SvRC1 
NRA threatened @SenThadCochran w election backlash.But NRA's GOP candidates R losing.He betrayed dead 1st graders for nothing #DemandAction
@SenThadCochran For shame.
.@SenThadCochran What you voted for is more crime, murder, suicide, and maiming. You're a sick fucking bastard with blood on your hands.
.@SenThadCochran You sir, will rot in hell, and it will be better than you deserve, you asshole.
@SenThadCochran Do you really hate American children so much you are eager to put weapons of mass murder in the hands of extremists? #ctl
@SenThadCochran if 20 dead 6 year olds doesn't make you do the right thing, then I have no use for you. SHAME ON YOU.
@SenThadCochran  I thank you obviously some people are uninformed about deeper issues and why we need to protect ourselves #impeachobama
@SenThadCochran What a coward you are.  Shameful.
@SenThadCochran I'll tell the dead children's families you call them "assault weapons" in quotes, like it's all not real.  That should help.
Disagreed w' positions before @SenThadCochran, but til today never been embarrassed to be represented by you.Why risk legacy by pandering?
@SenThadCochran ur a piece of cowardly shit
@SenThadCochran Shame on you for supporting lobbyists rather than listening to and protecting your constituents.
@SenThadCochran shame on you #coward
@SenThadCochran SHAME ON YOU !
@SenThadCochran You do not just represent your State. Read your oath. http://www.emailyoursenator.com/oath.html 
.@SenThadCochran If this #GunControl policy previously failed as you say, what are you doing to better protect innocents from gun violence?
@SenThadCochran you were elected by a democratic process, yet you failed to support that process in allowing a vote. You are a disgrace
@SenThadCochran You should be ashamed of yourself. The blood of children is on your hands #criminalvoter #criminalcongressman
@SenThadCochran Shame on you! YOU HAVE FAILED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! May your vote haunt you forever.
@SenThadCochran You are a coward and a liar. You placed the comforts of your office above your country and the safety of its citizens.
@SenThadCochran You're disgusting!!!!! Innocent people are being killed and you don't care. Next election we will vote NO for you!!!
@SenThadCochran why did u vote no?noone is taking ur guns u r an elected official our kids want to go to school feeling safer u stopped that
@SenThadCochran and you should be ashamed of that vote. You are on the wrong side of history.
@SenThadCochran these people are failing you #protect2a
@SenThadCochran You must be so proud. Can't wait to hear from you after the next mass shooting. @MomsDemand #lackofleadership
Sen Thad Cochran ( @SenThadCochran  ) voted NO on #guncontrol . Verdict: Bad Decision Maker, Weak/Puppet, Unqualified for Pub Office.
@SenThadCochran voted against the policy that was successful according to all statistical analysis while it was in effect -talk about 'fail'
@SenThadCochran Thank you senator!
@SenThadCochran Great job. Keep it up.
@SenThadCochran Thanks for your vote!
@SenThadCochran Thank you for using facts over emotions with your #guncontrol vote and for protecting our Constitution #2a
@SenThadCochran Shame on you. Did you sleep soundly last night? Did the faces of the children of Newtown appear to you in your dreams?
@SenThadCochran  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@SenThadCochran #ShameOnYou you human cockroach
@SenThadCochran & u voted against what the majority of ur country wants!!! Why isn't it the ppl of the country who vote?!?
@SenThadCochran received $8,500 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2008. http://ow.ly/kaMdo  #NRALapdogs #playdead
@SenThadCochran next time a mentally ill person opens fire on a crowd, how will you look in survivors eyes & justify your vote today?
@SenThadCochran took the 30 pcs of silver turn your back on all citizens broke your vows to America you will loose your seat we don't forget
@SenThadCochran I'm thankful you do not represent me. Nor do you represent 90% of Americans. disgraceful.
@SenThadCochran Why do you choose military rifles over children? Why is fear, anger, killing machines more important the lives of innocents?
@SenThadCochran SHAME ON YOU.
@SenThadCochran I will financially support the next person to run against you. To clarify - you voted against expanded bkgrd checks.
@SenThadCochran No, you voted with the paycheck from the NRA. A background check does NOT equal a gun registry.
@SenThadCochran SHAME ON YOU..............................................................................................
@SenThadCochran You are a total disgrace to America. May your "vote" haunt you forever
@SenThadCochran Shameful
@SenThadCochran You are a great American. Thank you for opposing the attack on our constitution.
@SenThadCochran coward. you've allowed all our children to be endangered. You've favored loop holes and criminals for the NRAs support.
@SenThadCochran Shame. #guncontrolvotes
@SenThadCochran do you have the courage to go to Newtown to explain your vote to enable guns for criminals & crazies? Would the NRA let you?
@SenThadCochran Shame on you. You are a disgrace indeed
@SenThadCochran Another leadership failure...continued lack of constituent representation.
@SenThadCochran Shame on you!
@SenThadCochran thank you for helping to uphold the 2nd amendment right for me and my family. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you
@SenThadCochran So guns are more important than children's lives? Sickening.
@SenThadCochran You could have made America's children safer, but you elected not to. So shameful.
@SenThadCochran You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@SenThadCochran Dead children don't vote. Nor contribute to campaigns. But I'm curious: Did it EVER occur to you to do the right thing?
Shame on you @SenThadCochran
@SenThadCochran And you're PROUD of it. Unbelievable.
@SenThadCochran That's OK douchebag.  we'll be voting against resurrecting your sorry bought and sold ass for another term.
@SenThadCochran failed policy? our senate is a failure.
@SenThadCochran #TwitterFamily let him know how soulless he is. He's bragging about voting Against Background Checks. #Shameful #Newtown
@SenThadCochran Should u wake and fine someone dead there will be your pride for allowing the shooter 2obtain a weapon illegally. #Shameful
@SenThadCochran You're a national shame. Why don't we put "assault weapon" on the school supply list since that's what the NRA wants.
@SenThadCochran U FAILED! Round ONE BUDDY>IT AINT OVER
@SenThadCochran  I stand ashamed of your actions today!
@SenThadCochran Hang your head in shame because your callous actions will result in more innocent children being senselessly gunned down.
@SenThadCochran Failed policy ?  Did you consider all the people who died of gun violence since it was repealed a success then ?
@SenThadCochran You proved today that you represent the highest bidder not those who voted you in, not the 90%. SHAME on you!
@SenThadCochran shame.
@SenThadCochran You have failed the American people and your electorate. Shame on you.
@SenThadCochran Are you f*cking kidding me?  Shame.
@SenThadCochran Good to know. We now know who to send the funeral bill for the next group killed via assault weapon.
@SenThadCochran LIAR! That bill was about background check. Ur a traitor to Americans
@SenThadCochran shame on you.
@SenThadCochran you're a sad man and a disgrace to this country
@SenThadCochran You’re a coward and a mouthpiece for the gun lobby. You make me ashamed to be a MS citizen.
@SenThadCochran I personally know how hard you work for your constituents!  It fails me why you would not say "yes"....an epic FAIL!
.@SenThadCochran you are a coward. #UniteBlue #Newtown
@SenThadCochran For shame. Remember the 90%.
.@SenThadCochran shame on you.  You have blood on your hands!
@SenThadCochran How many bullets sir does it take to kill a six year old? Shame on you
@brontyman @senthadcochran Good for you! I hope you sleep well with all the blood on your dollar bills.
