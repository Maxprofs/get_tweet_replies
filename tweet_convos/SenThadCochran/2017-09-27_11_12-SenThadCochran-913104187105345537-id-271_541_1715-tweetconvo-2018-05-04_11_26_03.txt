Hope you are well soon...when you go back plz support our president n the people that work hard n worked to get you elected
So Mittie you want ppl to lose their healthcare? How does a God fearing Christian want to harm millions of fellow Americans???
I hope we can get socialized medicine fully repealed some day.  Tax payers shouldn't be forced subsidize anyone.
Konrad that’s typical Republican thinking, to only care about yourself until you get into trouble.
That’s actually how insurance works, your car insurance subsidizes others and you get subsidized when you need it
Sure, but I shouldn't be mandated to carry it.  If I don't want health insurance, that's my risk.  That's part of living in a free country.
When you have an emergency and go to the ER to get life-saving treatment, the rest of us pay for it anyway.
Um no.  Not when I maintain private insurance.  I pay for it.  Then, insurance co can decide if they want to raise my rates.  u r not smart
.@SenThadCochran, with all due respect: if @potus  says you're in the hospital, then I'm sure you must be in the hospital.

My house may never burn down but I still pay taxes to keep a fire department and I may never need the police but my tax dollars pay them.
Imagine if you were sick and found out while sick you had contracted a disease from someone uninsured.  What would you do to live?
Get well soon, Senator Cochran! Make sure you wash your hands frequently. Those hospitals are filthy!
Thank you for telling the truth ! @realdonaldtrump will keep up his #alternativefacts and BS but hopefully more will awake !
Nice job thaddy. Pretend to be the one TREASON trump was talking about. WE all know he LIES about everything. Nice come back
Trump is lying. Maybe you should check back into the hospital?
Get well but get yourself distanced from Donald!
@realDonaldTrump Is this the Senator's vote you were talking about? Glad to hear your on the mend.
God bless & protect you Senator because of Kimmel, Satan's Frequency & the pathetic Oscars which been Boycotted by more than half of America the Republican Party SHALL experience Victory in the upcoming elections. In GOD we Trust 
#MAGA
sorry to hear you're under tge weather.  May you have a speedy recovery! God bless!
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @guardian
I thought you held up Graham-Cassidy passing... was @realDonaldTrump the @potus ...LYING!?
Maybe you should inform the president. He seems to have bad intel.

WOW!  Good thing you have government provided health insurance.  Get well soon.
So, as you have been ill, you understand the need for healthcare?  and why it is important to have it for everyone?
I wish you well even if we are on opposite sides of the political spectrum. Speedy recovery to you.
Such dignity and kindness
What a nation we will have
Get well. Your Prez thinks you're near death's door...
Glad u get to have life saving http://h.care  while ur @POTUS @GOP @SpeakerRyan try 2 take it away from millions
Take care!
#LiarInChief @realdonaldTrump says otherwise and doubled down
Republicans need 2 stay home. Get well, don't return.
Trump would lie about his mother ,only she's dead .
Like he dows with so many others, DJ Trump used your "hospitalization" to LIE about WHY he did not WIN on the latest Senate Healthcare vote
We are all hoping you are not returning to strip healthcare from millions of Americans, including your constituents.
But.... Trump said you were? We thought you were on your death bed
Healthcare for all
Tell Dotard!
So you're not at work or in DC? @realDonaldTrump was right  get well soon
Glad you have access to quality healthcare. Many don't. And many would-be entrepreneurs don't launch business b/c healthcare risk #Jobs
So, are you going to make a statement regarding why the president lied to the public about you as an excuse? #ImpeachTrump
Please retire. Your last two terms have embarrassed your legacy. We would like to have a #Conservative representing us in DC from now on.
You may want to let @realDonaldTrump know...
Just resign and stay here. #diagraceful
Are you speaking in Pontotoc this coming Saturday morning at the bicentennial?
Get well soon
Cochrane to Trump:  "I'm not dead yet!"
If the president says you're hospitalized, then you are. Trump never lies. Stop making him look bad. Oh, sorry, been reading too many bots.
Tell fox news to pass on to that idiot playing potus
Keep the ACA and then get Health Care for all. Thank you!
So, you forgot the #TrumpLiedAGAIN part.
How nice you have health care!
You just received medical care. Please imagine what your life would be like had you not been able to afford it.
Please get out of the Hospital SOOOOON!  Covfefe's been relentlessly hounding after you!  hahaha ah-hahahahaha
Look at the trolls, who’re about to beg him for a yes while he’s at home resting.
So you're to blame!!!!
Glad you’re not in the hospital! since you obviously have @realDonaldTrump attention could you advocate for the US citizens in PR?
Do you STILL support a prez who LIES - about YOU - to get what he wants, even though the AMERICAN PEOPLE are AGAINST it? 

Get well soon.
Thanks to YOUR president, people are now using the excuse, "there's a senator in the hospital" for EVERYTHING! SMH. Unreal.
And once you get better with your top-notch healthcare, I'll introduce you to your sickest constituents you voted to kill.
So did u pay any portion of that medical bill..and if so how much?  And what was ur co pay..  or did we the taxpayers foot the bill
Get well too bad 45 is blaming you for not repeal and replace. He had the votes he said...but you were  ...
I would be FURIOUS if someone talked about my health in public. @realDonaldTrump had no right to do that. So unethical.
Better keep your ears open next a viewing will be announced for the Rotunda at the capital
I believe Trump.  And YOU shouldn't be tweeting from your hospital bed.
You have been through a lot Senator. You are on in fact still hospitalized. Get better soon so you can give vote that we need. #MAGA
Never believed the in the hospital or the alien abduction stories. Just "Probing" journalism or irresponsible statements. Get well quick!
Hope you want All-Americans to have healthcare that you are blessed with or are you never fake Christian doesn't give a damn
Another that's voice dictation for you
trump didn't even know ur name when asked who was "hospitalized."
@realDonaldTrump a LIAR!!!
Are you saying the President lies?
fake news
Maybe you should step down, take a pay cut and go into some private practice with one of the catfish companies that pay your real salary.
U better vote "NO" otherwise I cud care less how ur health is.
So.... you're saying trump lied? Over & over?  He's not going to like being proven wrong.
So you're not in the hospital. But were you perhaps injured in another Bowling Green massacre or maybe while traveling to Nambia?
I’m glad you were able to get the care you needed. Don’t take that away from others. Get well.
Well wishes for a speedy recovery. Seems @realDonaldTrump is clueless, (nothing new) thinks your still in hospital
Glad you are not in the hospital and Trump is just using you as a scape goat. 
Let's hope you, like MCCain realize taking H/C away is not OK
Get well soon! Isn't it hilarious that Mr. Art of the Deal @realDonaldTrump can't make a deal because 1 senator took the day off. #Dotard
Sen Cochran the President of the United States has blamed failure of Health Care vote on you. @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @POTUS  @SenateGOP
Hospital, home, same difference to Trump.
@SenThadCochran u better tell @realDonaldTrump @POTUS ur not in the hospital bc he's having delusions that u r!Seek professional help Trump!

Please don't stay at home where you can't ruin America!
I'm sure you understand the value of health insurance. Please don't vote to take my insurance away because I have a pre-existing condition
Hope you are 100% soon, Sir.
Please reflect on your Constitutional Oath & return to Save Our Country from grasp of a liar & his syndicate.
Take your time, the Liar-In-Chief will still be there
Are YOU sure you're not in the hospital, because Trump said you were.
Get well soon, Senator. I'm sorry that our dishonest POTUS spread this rumor.
WRONG! You’re in the hospital. Dear Leader told us so.
The President said you're hospitalized, repeatedly. Was he intentionally lying? Why does the leader of the Republican Party lie to us?
So you had the procedure done at home then?
Exactly. Recuperating from what his office referred to as TREATMENT for a urological issue & heartless #libtards are all #TrumpLies stoopid.
Trump lied again.  this is getting old
Don’t worry, @realDonaldTrump is a compulsive liar. No one believed him. He was of course wrong that your vote would make the difference.
Thank you for you tweet. Wish you well recovery. Now some tell trump to stop spreading false information.
That's ok Thad, we are better off with you gone.  Political greed over American lives
Get well soon.
I'm actually surprised they didn't wheel you into the hospital to allow *45 to save face. Best wishes to you and your recovery.
Good thing you had government funded insurance. Hopefully you were having surgery to remove head from ass #TrumpRussia
As soon as your tax-payer funded healthcare gets you well enough, you're going to vote to take it away and/or not affordable for millions.
Get well soon and BTW...you could really mess up trump by telling him you're a NO vote.  Thanks for thinking of people over party!
Get well soon...and RETIRE! Thanks!
Rest up. Trump thinks you get many votes. ("we have the votes")
Another lie of 45..sorry you are ill..recover quickly..sorry your boss is such a liar  #maga
Stop it Thad, go and stay in the hospital. Make our Presido look good
Good to hear. But LISTENING TO THE PRESIDENT LIE, IS DISTURBING to say the least
@realDonaldTrump  HERE YA GO CHIEF LIAR. RESIGN!!!!
Trump and his lies. Impeach this fool
Here's to hoping there is a lengthy hospital stay in your future.
He's STILL saying you're hospitalized!
Sounds like a No too me. Lol
God grant you a speedy recovery and the grace to ensure all your constituents have health care access. Vote for your people not party.
Get well soon. I’m sure your healthcare is terrific. For our sake, please vote against Trump’s asinine replacement bill.
Thank God you have healthcare!
I believe you mean thank the American people.
Hope you have healthcare senator
Is your "home" in or near a hospital? Asking for a confused @POTUS prone to lying.
Get well soon!AND please remember the healthcare you are receiving when the #CorruptGOP bring #repealandreplace #ACA up again! #TrumpTaxScam
Our president lied? Really?
how's that cadillac plan insurance doing ya? Why isn't that plan good enough for all americans?
Gaslighter-In-Chief
Glad you have access to great healthcare to get well soon! Must be nice to not have to worry about it being taken away from you...
Please tell @POTUS so he can stop blaming you for the failure of Trumpcare.
Why do you suppose @POTUS lies so much? Why doesn't it bother the @GOP more?
Because his base doesn't fact check & the GOP play team politics. The don't care what people say or believe, just need to vote their way to gain approval!

So your the mysterious sen in the hospital, I wish you well
Trump is lying about you to deflect from his failure.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Dotard Don, he's not in the hospital. But thanks for repeating that lie and the lie "we have the votes". Huge Liar DT!
Wouldn't it be great if all US citizens had the same government funded health care you are enjoying?
I can call him for you. What's his number?
OMG, I think @realDonaldTrump believes you to be dead or something crazy like that. You may want to give him a call.
Home~Hospital *IT DOESN'T MATTER TO* @realDonaldTrump HE JUST SAYS STUFF**WORRIED ABOUT** UPCOMING INDICTMENTS ** #TRUMP_LIES #COCHRAN_LIES
Should have tagged @realDonaldTrump, he has you in a much worse state
Oh yea, taxpayers are paying for your healthcare too.
Just another Trump lie.
@jaketapper glad your ok. Must be difficult knowing your vote would have made the difference on healthcare !
How does it feel to have @realDonaldTrump speak #FakeNews about your condition?
Get well soon.  I am sure @realDonaldTrump will reprimand you for contradicting him.
Maybe you should go since @realDonaldTrump said you are!   Hope you feel better.

Feel better.
Your president is lying on you. I'm from Hattiesburg and you were once very nice to me when I met you as a girl. Help Mississippi.
I wish you a speedy and full recovery. I hope your taxpayer-funded care awakes you to the importance for affordable care for all! Fix ACA!
Bummer
Hope U are well & your gold standard insurance paid 4 by taxes took good care of U please Vote to keep #ACA for  millions so they're well 2
Get well soon.
Would have been a miracle if you were in two different places at same time. Those who knew the truth thought you had been cloned.
Hope your health care is better than the nil and void we might get.
Good cover. We can all count on you to put your hand on the Bible and lie like hell.
thats good how are you now?
You should resign. Live out your days on a lake.
@GOP @TheDemocrats #PuertoRicoNeedsHelpNow

Praying for your speedy recovery.
Rest well, Senator. Love you!
I’d stay home, Congress is a mess.
Also I’d like to thank you for your help to keep ACA.  Wink wink
Tired of that joker in the WH yet?
What do you have to say about Trump lying about you?
Good news is you are not in the hospital - the bad news is our @POTUS is completely delusional - please do something about it. #ImpeachTrump
@realDonaldTrump   Guess what???  He's not in hospital. You are clueless or a blatant liar. I think both
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1950447618559272&id=100007821572916 …
So where are you?!
Do your job !
Vote to REPEAL ObamaCare 
GOP are bunch of losers
You know the worst thing about ObamaCare?  The Obama part.  Don't want some nigger's name associated with my medical recovery.   #amiright
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1949345412002826&id=100007821572916 …
Your healthcare paid by US TAXPAYERS
How do you know this man's personal business? And if we are so what? Everyone deserves healthcare!
@realdonaldtrump says he had votes for #GrahamCassidy but @SenThadCochran was out sick leave.  Sen Cochran says he's fine.
Sir, best wishes for a speedy recovery.

Planning on destroying other people's healthcare no doubt.
But, but, but...your Leader said you were so one of you are LYING...oh...silly me...u are both Republicans so that's okay to throw out bull
You suck, you shouldn't still be serving. You stole the last election and MS will remember. To bad it won't be you to get primaried.
I hope you'll vote No on the HC bill!!!
Sending my hopes for a speedy recovery, but not too speedy. Take all the time you need, but please don't take my healthcare when you return!
He doesn’t give a damn.
Get well soon!
you were quoted by @ABC
He can't even get that right!
Our well informed president misled us again? Get well soon.
#TermLimits
do America a favor,..retire, let the conservatives run the show and fix the mistakes of you elites

Get well soon! Please don’t take healthcare away to replace with a crap bill because Obama didn’t do it.
Get well soon, sir!
Slugger, @SenThadCochran  Get well right now in Jesus Christ Mighty Name! You're healed, Sir!
#MAGA
#USA
Doesn't work that way. 
another fake black profile, sigh
They could at least switch up the profile picture. I’ve seen the same pic on at least 10-15 accounts! That’s just lazy. 
Our best to you Senator!

Trump just said it again 10 minutes ago. What is wrong with him?
