@SenThadCochran I'm confused. Since you're a liberal you don't give a crap about Israel. Why tweet this?
@SenThadCochran I want you to remember 2 words you filthy disgusting pig- recall election.
@SenThadCochran With all due respect, are you willing to stoop to the desperate measures of a Democrat and trash McDaniel as being racist?
@unaccounted_4 @SenThadCochran No shit!!  He and #Mcdaniel should have made a pact; let's not talk about race at all; such a stupid topic!
@SenThadCochran you're going to be sorely embarrassed at the polls tomorrow! Drop out to save face!
@hermann_desiree what's up with the name calling there's no need for that
@SenThadCochran You are a piece of shit. You need to change to the Democrat party, they are who elected you.
@SenThadCochran RESIGN SENATOR! Or change parties if you need lies and black Dem votes to win a primary
@SenThadCochran  the difference between Thad and a bag of poo:  the bag!
You broke the law by soliciting registered democrats to vote for you! You will never rep me you cheating fucker @senthadcochran
@williBradowens @SenThadCochran I'm not sure that's breaking the law. Its legal for them to vote, why not legal to solicit their vote?
MS law is strange, influencing a nonpartisan voter within 100 ft. of a polling station (Boom) @steph93065 @senthadcochran
.@SenThadCochran We are not going to vote for you in the general. You are about to lose, son.
@458Cincinnatus @SenThadCochran
 why couldn't he just retire, do E D  commercials, and do some fishing?
.@yewkalaylee He's going to lose the general hard. We don't need him. Race baiter threw his money away. And good riddance. @SenThadCochran
Hi @SenThadCochran, Congrats on your hard-won primary victory, all you had to do was lie like a Democrat. Senile jackass. #mssen

@SenThadCochran You don't care about Israel your a typical republican who has been in congress for decades collecting a check doing NOTHING
@SenThadCochran Get rid of the R and put POS after your name.
@SenThadCochran Can't say Cochran...without the Cock. *Austin Powers Smug look*
Do the right thing Thad, you lost minus the democrat votes you bought, no crooked politicians in MS! @senthadcochran
@SenThadCochran I don't live in your state thank God now I know what slimy people live there I wouldn't visit if you paid me to come there.
@SenThadCochran  just making sure you know that you are a soulless piece of human excrement. #CorruptPolitics
.@SenThadCochran You should apologize for your outright lies to MS Democrats about #Mississippi Conservatives. Sleazy way to win.
@Keene329 @SenThadCochran the senator from MS hasn't had a soul for decades. The ends justified the means. Self preservation.
.@texantrueblue he --> @SenThadCochran will not win in November. He told outrageous lies about more than half of his would-be voters.
@SenThadCochran https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=6E8p76GbpvY â€¦ a low life way to win. Make up lies, RINO. #MakeDCListen #gop #pjnet #waar #tcot #tlot #teaparty
@SenThadCochran How do you sleep at night, Senator? You do have a conscience, right?
@SenThadCochran U disgusting piece of shit. TAKE YOUR LIBERAL LOVING ASS TO THE OTHER SIDE.
@SenThadCochran You're a disgraceful old man, you used dirty racist tricks to scare the black community into voting for you. SHAME ON YOU!
@jane747 @SenThadCochran Sad that blacks didn't do a bit of research; just followed what the robocalls from #Dems told them to do... #Shame
@SenThadCochran  Thad will be short about 180,000 votes this fall..too bad thad
@SenThadCochran @SharNeal U should learn to get along with Tea Party. Next time u won't be so lucky.
@jerrysweesy @SenThadCochran     yep - cheating got the win this time
@SenThadCochran I'm guessing you no more listen to the people on this account than you do to your voter "base".
@SenThadCochran Do you have ANY balls, Thad?
@SenThadCochran If you have any balls whatsoever, I challenge u to answer how u decided to lie, chest and break the law to "try" to win?
.@SenThadCochran Sad when a GOP insider has to buy help from the opposition party to win his own party's senate nomination. #mssen
.@SenThadCochran 

Relying on democratic voters that you lied to.

@SenThadCochran <-- no better than Obama! He has made me think the GOP is in bed with the democrats. We need limit on terms for senators
@SenThadCochran Question. How does America pay for the ever lasting war movement you embrace without devaluing the American dollar? #tcot
@SenThadCochran evidently Mississippi is filled with RINO supporters who are scared of Obama. I'll never vacation there.

@SenThadCochran You are simply pathetic.
@SenThadCochran Maybe you haven't been informed last 66 years, but Israel confronts terrorism EVERY DAY in their own country.
@SenThadCochran Why are you playing phony race card to try to get Democrats to vote for you in the primary? Afraid a little?
@SenThadCochran You are disgraceful accusing the tea party as being racist. This is your legacy now and will not be forgotten.
.@SenThadCochran Listened to one of the dishonest, race-baiting robocalls your campaign has made to Democrat voters. So are you a Democrat?
@SenThadCochran Are you so desperate to keep your job in those DC marble palaces that you would unfairly accuse a conservative of racism?
@SenThadCochran Wouldn't strengthen are ties with Israel create more turmoil as most middle east nations have a bad relationship with Israel
@SenThadCochran Hey Thad, too bad you've never done anything to strengthen our middle east ally #Israel. Vote @senatormcdaniel
