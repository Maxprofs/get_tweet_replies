yes we do and have since Scalia died. Why did all Republicans walk past that for an entire year?
@SenateGOP 
Few Recall Gorsuch’s Volunteer Work at Harvard https://www.wsj.com/articles/few-recall-gorsuchs-volunteer-work-at-harvard-1486342894 …
#Maddow
we don't need Betsy Devos.  She is a stain that won't come out.  She will fail so bad and drag you down too.  Do not confirm
@SenateGOP Yeah, we needed nine a few months ago while Obama was still in office. Thanks for the #stolenscotus
Yes it is. I'm tired of seeing the dems running things when we have the house and Senate.
did you think we needed nine last year when the vacancy occurred?  I did.
don't even act like you're getting concerned now. We needed 9 LAST YEAR.
PLEASE RETHINK & VOTE AGAINST #GORSUCH.  He has been found to be a nutcase as well as disrespecting sep of church & state!  @SenThadCochran
@SenateGOP Let's not be too hasty.  I believe we are within 100 days of the end of Trump's term.  #RememberMerrick
one can only hope
"Time for the Senate to act". Shameful. The time to act was almost a year ago.
I was under the impression that it was ALWAYS "time for the Senate to act." For the People & all #toobusyblocking
This SCOTUS pick belonged to President Obama and Senate should have confirmed Merrick Garland.  #Filibuster #NeverTrump
You could have had nine. Long ago.
@whitehouse The people are waiting for help, we have been ruined and we want action for us too.
lol.  What? NOW? things deemed to be fine for a year with just 8.
I am tired of right and left politics. This man is too conservative.
@SenateGOP seriously?  Y'all weren't too concerned about all of 2016 with eight. Facism Forever Club?  Really? #NotGorsuch
Biden wrong to give 1992 speech but NO NOMINEE under consideration at that time. Gorsuch is antichoice, anti LGBTQ. #NO
@SenateGOP read these responses and listen to AMERICA.
@SenateGOP 9 for over a year and yet you blocked Merrick Garland. Talking to both sides of your mouth
we have a democracy although doesn't seem that way. Seems You prefer a dictatorship?
Wanted: One Republican with integrity to defeat Betsy DeVos
We needed nine when Garland was nominated. What you Republicans did was disgusting and hypocritical. Garland was qualified.
@SenateGOP We like 8
#NOtoGorsuch We don't need a conservative activist, we need a conservative who upholds the Constitution.  Hard to find.
Funny how this grand notion comes up when we have a "Republican" as POTUS. #DoubleStandards
@SenateGOP Garland yes, DeVos no.
@SenateGOP Please vote NO to DeVos- education of tomorrow's leaders is at stake!
That wasn't your tune last year.
Please support @BetsyDeVos. We need real change in America.
We needed 9 a year ago, but GOP didn't think that at that time
@SenateGOP we've needed 9 for a long time you seemed to manage alright a month ago. Nag nag
You are sick!
We've needed 9 for over a year! Where was the hearing for Garland?!
@SenateGOP We needed 9 a while back.  #SuperBowl so now you are in a rush to 9 justices. Obama had one for you. Fake Rush
then why the stall tactics for Obama? #StolenSeat rep agenda - party over america, shameful
HYPOCRITE! GOP sat on their hands for 293 days. @SenateDems will block! Filibuster! #resist #no2gorsuch
What happened to your respecting the highly respected Merrick Garland?
We needed 9 a year ago...but a group of no talent ass clowns prevented it. Know them?
@SenateGOP I can't believe you'd use "we need nine" after you obstructed garland. Garland > Gorsuch(^3)
We need moderation
I hope @SenateDems act just as quickly and with as much cooperation as you did with #MerrickGarland. Blessings
@SenateGOP You have been living with 8 since April.  How about 7 instead?
@SenateGOP also Trump is crazy. Maybe Frederick Douglas can stop by and advice him how to play nice w others like AU
@SenateGOP what you did was shameful and undemocratic. You've destroyed democracy to keep welding minority power
We oppose Gorsuch - a horrible nomination - please support our cries.
@SenateGOP Then you should have confirmed judge Garland.
@SenateGOP What's the rush? It hasn't mattered to you for the last several months
@SenateGOP I know you won't, but pleas vote no.
@SenateGOP
Yah and he supports big corporations over the little guy, families, average working ppl. GOP don't care about them. Just $$$
@SenateGOP You need 9? But you were perfectly content with 8 since 3/16/2016.
nah, let's leave it as it stands. Why not just wait until we have seven?
You are implying of course it is time to act because you all are well rested having NOT acted for over 8 months? #hypocrisy
@SenateGOPwith all due respect we needed 9 a year ago
We've needed nine for nearly a year now.
We need Nine GOOD Justices.  Don't confirm Gorsuch if he is going to undo already set precedents.
@SenateGOP Dems owe you nothing.
@SenateGOP Vote No on Betsy Devos! Unqualified! Stand up for All American children!
@SenateGOP you stole this Appointment - expect it to go S L O W. unless you like to proceed w/ hearings for Garland #JackAss
NO, you need to have integrity. You already had a nominee for the past year and did NOTHING. Shame on you! #IVOTE
@SenateGOP ass I hate this guy
@SenateGOP you need to get with your constituents, or you won't be reelected.
@SenateGOP I wonder why #weneednine sounds familiar
No we need a balanced court who knows what the Constitution is and upholds it. This choice is a good start.
@SenateGOP your career is over and you will all hang at "Nuremburg"
@SenateGOP oh yeah?? For a whole year your party said 8 was great. What a joke!!! Thieves!
@SenateGOP I can agree that Gorsuch is a good judge of law. But I am pro choice and this issue worries me.
i agree! Not convinced he will stand with our Constitution. UGH!
@SenateGOP  oh stop with your butt kissing. You were just fine to live with 8 for 10 months. #hypocrite
@SenateGOP who?
@SenateGOP senator, why do we need 9 now, but not this time last year? Response for why your party makes govt partisan only?
@SenateGOP you mean like how you acted for the last 8 years and Obstructed the Nominee from President Obama? #hypocrite
@SenateGOP we only need 8 #resist
You're way too late to act.  That seat should have been filled last year.
@SenateGOP we need a president not a dictator or a puppet controlled by a racist or Putin! Come on!
@SenateGOP Why?  We have had eight for a year. No problems mate!
Nuclear Option. Stick it in their face before Democrats try to destroy Gorsuch like they tried with Thomas.
@SenateGOP you condone fascists being appointed to the Supreme Court?
we need 9?  Time to act??? How bout needing 9 a year ago?  How bout acting then?  Wow.
Oh interesting you would think that because Scalia died almost one year ago. Yet.... 9 didn't matter.
U dare to post this when U and the rest of the GOP Senate failed to even hold a hearing for M. Garland?
#senilehyporcite
This presidency will have a scandalous end. How many of his choices you rubber stamp will define your legacy.
thanks for all you do!
nah, let's wait a while.  Until you and some other hypocrites can be voted out.
WILL PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMIT TO NOT MAKE ANY “IMPORTANT” DECISIONS IN HIS 4th YEAR??
but I guess 8 was fine while you and your party obstructed merick garland and president Obama#weneed9
Commend all you want.An honorable Senate wouldn't hear/seat anyone until they respect Mr. Garland with a hearing. Be honest.
you have to be kidding with this. Really? Did you even make this or did you just steal it from 6 months ago? Shameful
arguably well past
- Really? A fine candidate was nominated by a valid president who was not elected by Putin. You have some balls posting that
.@SenThadCochran Pls ask every Sen, who accepted campaign contributions from the DeVos family, recuse themselves frm voting #draintheswamp
We needed 9 almost a year ago. Gorsuch is not for #EqualRights must be blocked for 1,450 days.
We need 7. cut gov't.
We have NEEDED nine and y’all BLOCKED a great candidate. Shame on you.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Hahaha. Hahaha. Heh. Whooooboy. That's a #KneeSlapper, coming from @GOP
you didn't need 9 for 1 1/2 years. Just breathe old man
we've needed 9 for almost a year but only NOW you're concerned? Hypocrite.
We didn't need nine last February?
MERRICK. GARLAND
go back to the 1950's #cheetohfollower and more white only #cheetohsafespaces you people still want to create
8 has been fine
