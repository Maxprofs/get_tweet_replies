@LeoShane  they from iowa not from mississippi all the other vets were scared or democrats get it right
@doneplayingnow Yellow shirt vets in later pics were from Iowa. Red shirt vets were from Mississippi.
@LeoShane @doneplayingnow Probably yellow and black. Iowa is the Hawkeye State after all.
@jschmeling Hats could have been blacker...
@LeoShane Fantastic stories pouring out of you. Thank you so much. What a day!  Take the night off! Attaboys all around.
@Freeforall Many thanks. Still some more work to be done though...

@TheBrothersFund @MsRock4Ever @LeoShane Like WWII vets are intimidated by ANYBODY!!!!!
@YoursAlwys @TheBrothersFund @LeoShane I know. My Dad was 17 when he joined the Navy in 1942
@MsRock4Ever @TheBrothersFund @LeoShane There's a reason we call them The Greatest Generation!

@LeoShane @BCAppelbaum God Bless them EVERY ONE!! IF not for them we might not have a government!
@LeoShane These brave men stormed the beaches at Normandy, they better damn well let them storm the memorial they paid for in BLOOD !
@VonBehrens @hobbscoop @LeoShane Once Bad Azzes....still Bad Azzes......my tip for the day to DC & America is DON'T F%&# with these Guys!!!
@hobbscoop U know that meant "dont 'Fudge' with those guys"...ha  Resisting a tyrannical govt & following God's Word requires #AngerControl
@hobbscoop 10-4!  Why #Patriots MUST start Standing Toe-2-Toe & be willing to Arm themselves to protect whats already been paid for in BLOOD
@hobbscoop Yes, the Blood 4 what we enjoy being pissed away by spoiled cowards, it makes me sick! People dnt understand where this is going!
@LeoShane My Grandfather a paratrooper in WWII passed Dec. of last year. These vets are larger than life with TRUE GRIT!!!!
@LeoShane This was sick very sick WTF do they think Veterans are we are not stupid
@LeoShane Can I have permission to use this picture for a meme supporting these WWII Vets? Thanks for live tweeting, btw!
@LeoShane My dad was an honor flight participant last year.  These vets have more right to be at the Capital than Congress!

@LeoShane GOOD FOR THEM!! I love that generation
@LeoShane @KatieSweeney_1 good on the vets. Travelling all that way they Gould be allowed in. Glad it didn’t happen when I was there.

@LeoShane Gives me chills. This is what makes them the "Greatest Generation!"
@LeoShane your definition of "storm" is different than mine. Think you meant stroll.
Mississippi WWII vets have taken control of the WWII memorial in DC. It was supposed to be closed..  via @LeoShane #MS
@LeoShane They stormed Normandy and faced Nazi machine guns, I doubt cardboard barricades are going to stop them.  YOU GO, BOYS!!!
@LeoShane those guys stormed the gates of hell, the park service doesn't stand a chance
@LeoShane "Storm" in wheels chairs and walkers? Poor choice of words. They fought for a better gov't and deserve one.
