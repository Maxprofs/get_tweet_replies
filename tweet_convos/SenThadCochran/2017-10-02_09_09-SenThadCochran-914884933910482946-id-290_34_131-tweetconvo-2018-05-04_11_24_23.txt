How about DOING something, Senator? Or is the NRA's money too important for you to step on those toes? Yeah. We know how it is.
Ok...and what else you gonna do? You're one of the leaders in the US, so lead.
The ONLY ppl that need assault/semi auto/automatic weapons are the police & the military period!!!
Let's unite on sensible gun control. Private citizens do not need military grade assault weapons!
There's no excuse for you taking money from the NRA and voting "no" on regulating assault weapons. #GunContolNow
Let's pass some common sense gun laws that will actually be effective.
hagamos algo mas que orar
How about uniting and actually doing something about gun control?? Oh wait, the NRA owns you. Pathetic.
@NewtownAction  @Bradybuzz @Everytown @resp_solutions @MomsDemand @smartgunlaws @sandyhook @GabbyGiffords @ShuttleCDRKelly 
@SUPGVNetwork
who's trying to excuse it? "condemn this evil"? what are you rambling about? evil is those who vote for these types of weapons to be allow
Condemn the evil, pray for the families, wait, do it all over again in a few days or weeks. Repeat endlessly. 

Great job.
When you do the same thing over & over again but somehow expect a different result, that's a pretty good definition of insanity.
Let's unite to do something about guns. Empty words otherwise.
Just curious, since you have no balls, is it just a patch of wiry white spider leg pubes that spread up your sagging ass crack or what?
And then take action for the victims and their families! Vote NO on the #shareact. You are in the Senate Majority, we are all subject to you
we pray for people like you to change laws. Our prayers go unanswered. There's no excuse for that either. #enough
Let's condemn lawmakers who take money from the NRA. Your job is to vote for change, not prey.
 NOT A TYPO
#VoteDontPrey
#GunControlNow
Condemnation and prayer have been rather ineffective thus far. But go ahead and tweet out this useless pablum so the NRA give you a B+.
there's no excusing you for taking blood money! no one needs your prayers, we need u OUT of congress!
There's no excusing the horror that occurred in Las Vegas. Let's unite to condemn this evil and pray for the victims and their families.
While you PRAY, we're PREY! Pass sensible gun laws NOW!
Historical data show prayer won't  stop this kind of violence-historical data also shows gun laws will- Ask Australia and other countries...
Obvious to tell who Cochran's supporters are.  
Your whole party needs to take your "thoughts and prayers" and seriously just shove them in your wallet with your NRA money.
Prayers do nothing. 
Legislation does.
U better pray 4 ur soul. FYI, there was no such thing as assault weapons when 2nd amend was written. Ur greed & ignorance is killing ppl!
Prayers are not enough.  Do something.  Take action.  Provide leadership.
Common sense gun control! Stop taking money from the fucking NRA.
I would ask you to take a stand but you're from Mississippi so I can already tell you won't do shit beyond count up those @NRA  dollars.
How about we condemn all the politicians taking blood money to vote against the safety of Americans. There’s no excusing that behavior.
There's no excusing the horror that occurs every time @GOP legislators choose their own wealth over citizens of this country. #doyourjob
Thad, can I call you Thad? I sent my thoughts and prayers to your parents when naming you but they didn't listen. Sorry.
Hypocrite....
Quit taking the NRA's money and start helping pass some common sense gun control laws.  Shame on you for fake platitudes and posturing!
So what will you do to combat this evil? will you increase access to mental health treatment? Where's the legislation? Or just keep praying?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
The true Evil as you put it is that someone failed to do their job and protect Americans from this sort of gun violence. Was that You ?
Ban all assault style weapons. Thoughts and prayers don't work.
Wait. Did you get hurt in Vegas? Is this why @POTUS insists you’re in the hospital? News said it was urological. Were you shot in the... ?
So you will be onboard to change laws and take war weapons off the streets?
Your prayers mean nothing. All words, no heart. No action. It's just words that you're used to saying. Do something for once!
@SenatorBurr Hasnt your dry cleaner told you? Thoughts and prayers can't remove NRA blood money Stains out of your pockets.
.@SenThadCochran took $9,944  from @NRA He'll condemn gun atrocities but wont *do* anything to stop them
 #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Put up or shut up.
You take @NRA #money .. you also have blood on your hands & this is your fault ..
You and the @NRA should pay for their funerals. Murderers.
Maybe an Ambien will silence the knowledge that you are complicit in this mass murder.

And do something about it, for God's sake.
Who voted against gun control? Joe and Mika read their names http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/who-voted-against-gun-control … #BloodOnYourHands
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
How about some GUN CONTROL, Thad.
How dare you sully the memory of those lost with your inaction. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
In addition to praying, it is time to implement true gun control. #nomoreguns
Enough prayer senator; stop fellating the NRA for 30 pieces of silver. Protect Americans. You have blood on your hands. #LasVegasShooting
We're going to unite and get rid of lawmakers like you who take blood money.
Do you believe just condemning this & praying for the victims will prevent future #MassShootings? #GunControlNow
How about something more effective than praying?? 
BS
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So ask yourself if there is anything you can do to prevent future loss of life.
Prayers don't stop bullets. Stop taking blood money from NRA (a terrorist org) & do something.
We need action not meaningless condemnation! Stand up to the NRA for reasonable gun control! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Blacksburg. Newtown. Aurora. Fort Hood. Charleston. Orlando. And now, Las Vegas.  Is it still to soon to talk about gun regulations?
Hypocrite! How much blood money did you get from the #NRA? Save your phony prayers and pass strong #GunControlNow and #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Let's enacted sensible gun laws. Please vote to continue to ban silencers.  There's no reason to loosen these restrictions.
"Republicans" = gun lobby. If Sandy Hook didn't change your fetish with unfettered gun access, nothing will.
Agreed. The horror is inexcusable.Send back the money, vote down the gun silencer bill #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you got $9944 from @NRA
There's no excusing the NRA whores sucking on Wayne LaPierre's money filled cock either, but that won't stop you and your GOP colleagues.
Let's unite to pass sensible gun control legislation. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Let's unite to enact responsible gun laws instead! How many more have to die senselessly?!?! 
Don't just pray; vote for some sane gun control in this country. How many more innocent people have to die?
Pray and restrict guns. Better background checks, coordination between states, etc
So what's your excuse Senator for taking money from death merchants? YOU facilitated these murders. Stop praying. Your prayers = worthless.
Blah blah blah. We see you.
How much have you taken from the NRA?   #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You’ll take their money though won’t you?
I noticed you didn't give any way to stop the horror. Just to unite and condemn. I don't think that's going to cut it.
So keep on praying, but don't ACT...
How about we unite to pass legislation to take weapons like that out of civilian hands instead of offering platitudes.
You took money from the gun industry.
You voted against assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
enjoy the blood money, Thad!
Are you serious w/ this? You are a NRA accomplice to mass murder. You've refused to unite to take action. Screw your prayers. #GunControlNow
There's no excusing Congressional inaction on sensible gun control laws. You are #Complicit - the blood of these victims is on YOUR HANDS!
Victims & families don't need the prayers from some douchebag senator what they need are common sense gun laws so this doesn't happen again!
No excusing that @SenThadCochran took $9,944  from @NRA #hypocrites
don't forget to cash your NRA checks, thad
Then give the NRA their money back. Or is there maybe a LITTLE excusing?

Because that has been 10,000 times less effective than the dog collar the NRA gave you to wear and speak for them. So helpful, so cowardly.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You are an accessory to mass murder: http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Thad_Cochran_Gun_Control.htm …
@SenThadCochran GUNS
Condemning & praying may ease your conscience, but until YOU and your fellow GOP do what needs to be done these victims blood is on YOU.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
ENOUGH of your damn prayers, which do nothing. Explain to us why civilians need military weapons. If you say self-defense I will laugh at u





Let’s have a reasonable discussion on gun control!!!



GOP and NRA are partially responsible for this disaster. Fully automatic weapons & high capacity magazines made this madman much more deadly
The arsenal he used went far beyond what anyone could say was necessary for self defense. Congressional inaction is inexcusable.
Is here excusing the $9,994.00 you took from the @NRA ? #LasVegas
Hey Thad - you've been doing a lot of condemning & praying, but these acts of terrorism still keep happening. Maybe #GunControlNow?
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
I would rather pray you return the BLOOD, literal BLOOD $ you took from @NRA. And then pray you come to your senses and pass gun control.
And yes, I am one of your constituents who just wants sensible gun control.
So when can we expect legislation introduced by you to outlaw assault weapons in US? Or don't you have the courage? I won't hold my breath, Senator, because I figure you don't. Surprise me and make me a liar.
save us your #thoughtsandprayers, #SendBackTheBloodMoney and get to work on #CommonSenseGunControl
You take NRA blood money...thoughts and prayers are worthles
I 1:15 Whn u spread out ur hands in prayer I hide my  from u even when u offer many prayers I am not listening ur hands are full of blood!
Your words are hollow; you accept money from the NRA and do their bidding
Condemning Evil does nothing - pass effective gun legislation instead!
lets start with gun control, keep it simple for you and your followers.
You EXCUSE the #HORROR every time you accept blood tainted #NRA money. Stop asking for #PRAYERS & actually do something to stop the CARNAGE.
Did you mean to say there is no excuse for not banning automatic weapons? Praying will not solve this.
Stuff prayers. Put thoughts into action to stop this madness. Otherwise, you're a coward who values money and power over people's lives.
It's not "evil" it's the guns. We take off shoes and jackets to get on a plane, but some asshole grabs his assault rifle & shoots 600 people
I assure you my shoes and jacket are not "evil". Assault weapons are.
@SenThadCochran took $9,944  from @NRA He'll condemn gun atrocities but wont *do* anything to stop them
Stop taking money from the NRA and do what is right by your constituents. Stop letting the NRA kill innocent people.
Do something that will actually make a difference! Let's unite and ban assault weapons
Its time as a lawmaker you take steps to prevent tragedies like this.
Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
#GiveBacktheBloodMoney
You need to send back the blood money you took from the NRA
There’s no excusing profiting off of death either Thad. Will you stop? #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney, and then let's talk.
There's a way to stop it. Gun control.
Your prayers aren't enough.
#GunControlNow The horror is seeing this over and over and refusing to do something about this. So make legislation happen
Hey shit for brains: your job is to do more than condemn evil! Do your job or get outta the way!
.@SenThadCochran took $9,944  from @NRA He'll condemn gun atrocities but wont *do* anything to stop them

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Not one reply in favor of status quo on gun laws. GOP approval ratings at an all time low and still sinking.
Gun control is the solution.  Individual carrying 10 long range guns into an hotel room is unbelievable.
It was a terrorist attack man!!! Why won't you call it what it is man??!!!
Stop condemning and start refusing to be an NRA tool? How about starting w/the $10K you got from the NRA. Give it back & retrieve your soul.
#thanksNRA  for cheap bullets and big magazines!
Hey Washington, here's an idea: pass the Murphy Bill.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney from the NRA.
Condemning and praying does shit.  It's obvious, so you must have an inability to learn.
Prayer, like talk, is cheap.
Refuse all further donations from the NRA and support sensible gun control
Unite to condemn assault weapons
How many yrs have you been in Senate & have done NOTHING to stop this? You are 1 of 100 of most privileged & powerful in country of 300M+.
No excusing the willingness to take dirty NRA money. This is YOUR fault, so save us the empty words.
Praying is nice. Action is better. God wants you to stop the slaughter. It’s in your hands. #guncontol
This is blood on your hands. YOU took @NRA money and YOU blocked any action we could take to stop this.
Establishing stricter gun control laws would be an amazing way to honor the victims. #CongressStartTalking
But don’t do anything about it.  I think there might still be a couple nut jobs out there without an assault rifle.
Your words r meaningless-u took $9,944 from @NRA -hows the bribe workin 4 ya? Fill ur coffers instead of protecting those u swore 2 protect
You sir have blood on your hands
Pass gun control legislation now
You forgot to mention that it's about damn time Congress actually did something about it! There is no excusing them for not acting.
Empty words. Empty and sad. Save your prayers. Do something. Enact gun control laws. Now.
Praying will not help as long as people like YOU are bought by the NRA and promote guns and silencers.  Hypocrite!!!!
Didn't you take a bunch of money from the  NRA? Give it back. Vote for more sensible gun regulation. Then your words might mean something.
Try doing something to end the gun violence in this country.  Start by coming off the NRA payroll.
Some common sense gun control!! That's all I ask. 
How about we put down with bible long enough to vote for an assault rifle ban?
.@SenThadCochran took $9,944  from @NRA He'll condemn gun atrocities but wont *do* anything to stop them. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Let's take automatics weapons off the streets!
Looks like the NRA paid you 9.9k green excuses in 2014 not to condemn this evil by enacting meaningful, effective gun reform ...
Thoughts & prayers don't really do much. Do you bathe in your #NRAbloodmoney? Here's a country song - a little less talk & a lot more action
Maybe you should make laws that require more gun control
"Our thoughts & prayers are with the families & victims of this tragedy. Our votes and cashflow are with the @NRA." > @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP
stop taking @NRA money you scum
#NoMorePrayers it's time to act, Senator. We need psychological tests for ownership, background checks across the board, and no assualt.
Let's unite to prevent mass murders by outlawing/preventing access easily-modified auto weapons. Hold the the @NRA accountable, maybe? #nah
Here's an idea:  Don't vote for the Share Act, which will deregulate  silencers, which are needed for what legitimate reason, anyway?
Prayers don't fix bad public policy.  Our nation's reliance on prayers  to fix problems that WE cause is what allows these tragedies.
You're bought and paid for by the NRA.  Give back the money and do something to help.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Unite to condemn... Hmm.. So you gonna stop accepting NRA money ??
So a life is worth $10, 000?
You're going to hell for this
There's no excusing u taking $ from NRA. Save your thoughts and prayers
How's about you return the $9,944 you received from the @NRA? Does that come with automatic thoughts and prayers? #bloodmoney @igorvolsky
