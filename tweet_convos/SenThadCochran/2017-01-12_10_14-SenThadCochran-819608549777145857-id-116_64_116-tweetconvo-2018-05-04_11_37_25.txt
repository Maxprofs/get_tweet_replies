Politicians who attack #yesallwomen's right to #abortion care are unsustainable.

States use #corporalPunishment most have highest murder rates includ #Mississippi
We have as yet to see the replace portion. Unfortunately, you are an elected representative of the people. Actually represent us for once.
I sincerely hope that you treat it as replace, then repeal. So many Mississippians depend on and benefit from the ACA.
Thanks for voting against your own constituents. Please do not accept your government paid insurance.
@SenateGOP Are there pamphlets that explain the new insurance packages & premiums?  How do I get one?  When will cards come?
@SenateGOP No replacement!?!? My ins will go away. Absolutely no way to prevent having Multiple Sclerosis. Thanks.
Make it better.  Don't replace and repeal and waste taxpayer money.  In fact Impeach & replace MAD TRUMP
PRACTICING PHYSICIANS OF AMERICA - real physicians, no lobbyists or $$. We want to help legislators with #healthcare reform
I am saddened to see this during wee hrs...for those of us whose healthcare will lost, it feels like a betrayal #wreckless
A country without abortion care is unsustainable.

You will have blood on your hands sir
It's not called Obamacare, that is phrase made up by it's opponents. Call it the ACA.
@SenateGOP it is sustainable stop cutting taxes for corporate America!
Pls meet with real docs -PRACTICING PHYSICIANS OF AMERICA,FEB. 2,8:30–12:00 LOC--JEFFERSON BLDG Members Rm 1st Floor, LJ162
This will be a disaster for your state. Ds should not have helped you survive your primary.
Politicians making more than minimum wage is unsustainable.Time to #repealandreplace those,too.#yesallpoliticians
Parasite politicians with great healthcare on our dime are unsustainable. #yesallpeople #yesallpoliticians
All to enrich your puppetmasters. Meantime, we will be DYING. #Murderers http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2016/12/15/obamacare-repeal-results-in-tax-cuts-for-the-rich-tax-increases-and-lost-insurance-for-the-rest/#2b0aa91169b3 … #ObamacareRepeal
12yrs?Obama in office only 8 yrs right? Selling out USA? What does Russia have on #trump?
Don't you think government is too big and slow to change to waste so much money on an "experiment"? Sound thinking is right!
@nickberoxbe1989 it's also crap health care
YOU HAVE NO REPLACEMENT! NO REPLACEMENT! THIS IS A CRIMINAL ACT IF PEOPLE DIE.
@SenateGOP You haven't noted any replacement to the ACA and whatever comes next needs to be better as it's been 8 years
@SenateGOP Can GOP create an organized and strategic process to repeal and replace Obamacare?????
.@SenThadCochran @SenateGOP I think you forgot the whole "replace" part. Instead you put millions of American lives at risk. #SaveACA
okay then I hope you plan to add a billion people to your private insurance and your premiums go up
@SenateGOP when people realize you took away their coverage - that's when you can pack your bags. You're going home
WE KNOW U WANT TO REPEAL OBAMCARE TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE PEOPLE & PUT IT IN YOUR POCKETS SO - STOP WITH BS!!
.@SenThadCochran @SenateGOP can you please share the details on your health plan? #GOP
THE GOP IS UNSUSTAINABLE!
...wish to nullify any advancements made by an exemplary President. Shame on you.
You have no plan in place to offer a viable alternative. My feeling is that you and others simply.....
I've called your office and begged that this very thing NOT happen. Please don't ignore the wishes of your voters.
AND OFFERED WHAT REPLACEMENT??? Repeal and replace is a lie, and you should be ashamed.
@SenateGOP Obamacare is the biggest "tax" increase on the middle class ever, if you include the exorbitant deductibles!
@SenateGOP you won't get elected again if you kill off your base
@SenateGOP you are hurting the people of MS.  VOTE AGAINST REPEAL!
we the PEOPLE will remember this come election time.  Our voice will be heard
repealing without a plan to replace is negligent. Women, children and sick Americans are at risk for your twisted vendetta
shame on you and your GOP cronies for siding with you own agenda over what the PEoPLe want. Sir, you work for us.
@SenateGOP 
I've been waiting since 1986 for a secure border
@SenateGOP where is he replacement. You are lying to the American people and we see you
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Can u tell us--your constituents here in MS--what is the GOP's plan to replace it? <...crickets...>
In case you missed it. Rot in hell for working to take my children's healthcare. You are a monster!
@SenateGOP what you have done/ are doing is reprehensible. You do not represent the American people.
thank u
@SenateGOP I hope you all rot in hell for taking healthcare away from my children
Please explain your logic to all of your fellow Americans. Millions of people not having healthcare is truly unstainable.
YOU WELL BE A MURDER IF YOU DO THIS
You're a coward. You'd rather repeal it and leave us with nothing than make it work. #dicklessshits #goldenshowers
You have affected so many people's lives w your stance. Understand what you are doing. How do u sleep at night?
He sleeps on a bed of kickbacks and children's tears.
Yes. 'Tis sad. He has no idea what is feels like to have compassion.
@SenateGOP you should be ashamed of yourself and I am in the midst of cancer and I rely on my healthcare .
@SenateGOP GOP Stop CEO multi-million $ salaries to bring down healthcare cost! #SaveACA #Obamacare
@SenateGOP you did it with no replacement plan. 30,000,000 fewer Americans without health ins, but u made your political pt.
I hope that we don't go back to pre-existing conditions and 20 million uninsured:
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @SenToomey U r not listening 2 us! Trump when between crossfire will throw you under the bus!
@SenateGOP You know this is wrong. Trying to erase all things Obama is going to cost lives and hardship. #youjustdontcare
@SenateGOP what is the replacement plan?!
Well, Thad, what, exactly is your replacement plan?
END OF AN ERROR - CONGRATS

@IngrahamAngle #SeanHannity #DNCChair #TrumpInaugural @CNN
Replace with what? Inevitable death?
@SenateGOP nah 12hrs ago y'all set in motion to leave 30 millions without insurance,and ND fatten  the insurance companies
@SenateGOP let's hope and pray no one dies because you got rid of their insurance.
with NOTHING!
@SenateGOP Bullshit...what kind of insurance you voting to get yourself and your colleagues?...how about Medicare for all.
@SenateGOP Do it and avoid the UK/NHS mess. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, but it's still the road to hell.
The first thing to be repealed better be congressional healthcare!
How would we ever know; you insurance company crony Reptilians have been throwing wrenches into it from the start
@SenateGOP Republican ideology is unsustainable.  Our country cannot keep you.  #TheResistance #resist #GOPLies
.@SenThadCochran @SenateGOP Will you be sharing the replacement plan w/ your constituents soon? Or will you leave people sick w/o coverage?
@SenateGOP  SO many of my patients don't realize OBAMA care and ACA are the same thing!!! Many in shock and fear.
@SenateGOP and you will need plenty of time to attend a lot of funerals due to your action. Good job! #Obamacare
@SenateGOP Perhaps we could cut some corporate Welfare?  Oil subsidies?  Figure it out. #GOPlies #resist #trumplies
@SenateGOP the ACA helped my cousin pay for chemo & it enables my aunt it get health care w/ her preexisting condition!
@SenateGOP as long as you have a plan
The pendulum of power will swing back to our house; make no mistake it is inevitable. "The people" are with us.
@SenateGOP leave my health insurance alone !
@SenateGOP Replace with the old system, please..#FreeMarket
