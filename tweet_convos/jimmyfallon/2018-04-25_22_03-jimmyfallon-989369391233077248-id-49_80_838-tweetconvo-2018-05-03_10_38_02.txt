Jimmy you’re a great storyteller  I can hear you all day & night #LateNightSeth
Love you both so much! #BFF @sethmeyers
You gotta bring @BoomerWells33 on the show to talk about that story
I had to go find this, from when Horatio was on your show 
So funny story Jimmy!
“True stories”.....is that your a puppet for the dirty, perverted Weinstein Hollywood Elitist....Hopefully, and prayfully, ur time and career is numbered.....KARMA is ALIVE and flowing in our Country and in this Universe.
Jimmy invite me to your show. I love youuuuu
Really classy young boys!!
Jimmy great stories just sort of happen don’t you think almost by an accident..hey by the way if you happen to have a picking session in Central Park and need a mandolin player I’m available 
Man, you never call me to your talk-show.
Goodnight Jimmy, it’s been a gorgeous show with you tweeting to us, and thanks for the follow you did for a bunch of my pals, they are on cloud nine now!!
Jimmy I could listen to your stories forever. Espically the Slip n Slide table. You have led such a life so far. Now please go to bed as you have to work tomorrow.   #FallonTonight @jimmyfallon @LateNightSeth
I love hearing SNL stories. They make me very joyous.
"really classy guys" 
Will I ever be visiting your following list someday?
Ahhhhhhhhh so funny and amazing 
How ironic you and @sethmeyers should tell that story about @BoomerWells33 since Monday was Boomer's bobble head night at the stadium to commemorate that game!
I Love Your stories so much Jimmy! So much fun !!!#LateNightSeth
I love your stories Jimmy  #LateNightSeth
Can you write a book of your SNL storied..and if not why?
LMAO 
You know one of my boyfriend I hated, sandy, East Indian jerk.  I still hate him and that’s not his real name.  He stole it from me and gave it to his friends at the phone company to spy on me.
Will I ever see myself in your following list it would be a dream come true!
It would mean allot if you slide into my followers!
You should be on LNSM at least once a year.

I could sit and listen to the two of you talk together, and tell your stories, for days!  You are both amazing!  Love you guys!!
