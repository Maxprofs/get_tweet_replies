@pattonoswalt is dreamy. 

The way he loves is a standard all men should strive for.  It makes him as hot as hell.
Are you TRYING to rip a hole in the space-time continuum?!

Please ask @jimmyfallon what it feels like to get clobbered by #StephenColbert night after night.
I hope you got the news about the East Area Rapist before recording with @pattonoswalt
Trash
Seth is way cooler than Jimmy. The best thing about Jimmy is The Roots.
YESSSSS
https://www.mediaite.com/online/lgbtq-group-rescinds-award-for-joy-reid-after-homophobic-blog-posts-revealed/ …  The hypocrisy of you all is truly astounding!!!

My boys, I very much love this
I hope Jimmy Fallon shared the secret with Seth Meyers that the vast numbers of Trump jokes aren't funny.  Just not good comedy.  Comedy should be more creative.  Also it's not smart to piss off half of America with something that deeply offends them over and over each night.
Someone should inform Miss Minogue that someone is clearly taking photos of her while she is asleep.
Am, the guests sound awesome!! Who needs sleep anyways?
I AM SO EXCITED.
Wait! Seth has Patton today?! That's what I call serendipity!
