Morning Jimmy. Happy Friday. You did Burton Cummings proud. Feel the love.   #FallonTonight @jimmyfallon

You guys did rock that out. The original story of that song (myth? Real?) is hysterical. Burton was late. The band just kept playing the same riff wondering when he’d run out. He finally did and started singing. Made the thing up on the spot. An audience kid had a tape recorder.
Good Morning Have A Nice Friday!!!!
Burt, my homeboy!
This was awesome.  First Drafts of Rock is one of my favorite things ya'll do. Always funny .... but showcases your musical talent. ♡♡♡
