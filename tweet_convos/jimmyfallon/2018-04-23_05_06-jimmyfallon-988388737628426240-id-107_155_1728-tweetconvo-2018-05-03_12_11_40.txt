Well looks like #ChrisRock didn't have the guts to say his ex-wife joke where once you get to a net worth of $100 million dollars you'll have thousands of women 20 years younger just begging to replace her. Didn't want to lose 1/2 of his fan base, huh Christopher.  #FallonTonight
@OfficialSting you looked like you were proper high during the show! And you seemed agitated too!
The best show ever man! Finally I got to see you
