a GIF from me to you.
I have a feeling this will outlive me. So fun. #FallonTonight turn on @NBC now!!!
I should mention that it’s me tripping over a Cheeto. That was the challenge. Very difficult. #FallonTonight #KevinJamesNetflix
Props to Chevy Chase for the inspiration. #FallonTonight

I love Kevin James he's so funny in every show and movie. I've watched King of Queens every season and episode about 3 times, I think to myself who comes up with the ideas for the show mad funny, I love it!!!!!
Jimmmmmmy!!!! We all know how prone you are to accidents. Please be careful. I hope there were no broken bones or scratches this time.
I absolutely can't wait for this. Kevin James is awesome .... and you ALWAYS give him a run for his money Jimmy!!!
