I love you! You still are adorable, and have a sweet 
smile!
omg. My entire childhood I crushed on him. From Eight is Enough!!!! Yup cousin Jeremy!!!
I m BL NITARWAL
I have no clue

Oh Daniel-san you have so much balance now!
Great loved seeing karate kid #good memories
@P0LISHPHEN0M check it out
Crazy how we are all getting some cool reboot or sequel. @frightrags is getting a new #halloween. #roseanne for you. #karatekid for me.
Because they can't come up with anything new,  so they just want to bring back what used to work, but sometimes, just leave well enough alone.
I couldn’t disagree with you more. If you take a moment to look at the Roseanne reboot stats, you will clearly see people still want it today & are loving it every week. It used to work then and is CLEARLY working well now. This is a dream come true for the fans.
I did say some,  not all.
He's still alive? No offense just a lot of actors have died lately.
Ahaha!génial !trop drôle #good night cher Jimmy

I think you should invite @priyankachopra to the show and do a dance off Bollywood vs Hollywood! I think it would be really fun to watch!

Hi Jimmy  Happy Friday 
Dude does not age!

Awesome lineup 
Right hand ah circle,  Left hand ah circle... 
Don't forget to breathe, very important. 
Lol... the great??

Yaaaas
I recently watched a karate kid reunion talk and didn't realize what a troubled and complicated person Pat Morita was. His portrayal as the calm and collected Mr Miyagi was sold to audiences but the reality was far from that
That's fitting! Ralph is still a cutie! Can't wait Jimmy-san.
I thought that was @TopherGrace

Wait! Isn't that @TopherGrace ???

hi handsome
Your thoughts, @ActuallyNPH ?
san-the-floooor-! 
I missed some wrong information to Switzerland 
Ralph looks like @TopherGrace  in that pic.

Get him to "wax off " on national TV. 
Doin' it for Johnny! #Greasers
Johnny is going to sweep his leg and gets his revenge
#SweepTheLeg
Daniel son
Jimmy, get @robertmaschio on your show! Karate five 
Chipins! New animated series about a group of high school friends who struggle every episode to get enough money to smoke weed. https://youtu.be/noKlygUijBU
