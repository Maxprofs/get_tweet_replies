I'm still up. R u????
That was gross!!! It was a great magic trick though!!! #DavidBlaineMagic #FallonTonight

i won tickets to see him in a few weeks in San Jose!! woo hoo
That was CRAZY!!!! #DavidBlaineMagic #FallonTonight

#Jimmy Fallon. I Can't sleep.. 
all I see are slimey #frogs, & #David Blaine. I love you #Jimmy Fallon.
It is going to take a lot to bring me down off this "high" from your show.
Went from watching a fun skittles eating contest to a JIGSAW TRAP 
And I used to love you Jimmy... why?!? Just why?!??? Just say NO to needles and thread and frogs!!!!
My reaction the entire time. I can't even handle that. Nope!
I got no words, just.... #FallonTonight
And now YOU on Seth’s show, @jimmyfallon ?!?! I think this should be officially Jimmy Fallon Day in New York City!! Love it and love you! Glad I only gagged a few times with that frog trick and didn’t need to throw up so I don’t miss you on this next show!
OMFG I JUST LITERALLY RAN TO THE BATHROOM AND ALMOST VOMITED
Me too!
Ironically today, the morning after I had to binge on dry PRETZELS at 12:30am to get rid of my NAUSEA from your hysterical, amazingly gross magic segment with @davidblaine swallowing the frog last night ... TODAY (LOL) actually happens to be #NationalPretzelDay !!!!   
My lips hurt. Can’t un-see the frog being regurgitated & then back inside!
What kind of witchcraft was that! I could tolerate the video by focusing more on @jimmyfallon or @priyankachopra reactions. Also, David Blaine isn’t real. No.
OH MY GOSH! THIS IS SO FUNNY! It’s now 2AM & I just can’t sleep! My eyes were closed but I’m Still nauseas and laughing!!!!
I keep wondering what that poor frog is thinking...  Still feeling a little nauseous.  #FallonTonight #DavidBlaineMagic
What does a horny toad say????
