Great to hear!! What about The Shape of Water? Seen that yet?? Lol! #keepbeingamazingregardless

I've never heard Trump speak so when I read his tweets all I hear is your impression of him.  Thank you.
According to White House staffers, Chief of Staff John Kelly called Donald Trump an idiot, saying that he doesn't even know what DACA is.

Sure he does. It's fun for him to stay at the DACA, where he can hang out with the boys and have a good meal.
Can you even fathom the futile irony of your claim?
I m upset that a liar can’t be exposed for making WH communications a farce!
Loser @StephenAtHome tries to rap and fails miserably
Thx I love true human stories of triumph
Looking forward to seeing it!
I am dying to see it!!!
I just saw that episode of #Quincy where he found diamonds inside a dead guy and ended up getting poisoned by the mob and had to get an antidote. A real metaphor for our times!!!
Still waiting for you to stand up for @michelleisawolf please
@StephenAtHome my nomination President @JoeBiden as @VP may come as shock or surprise to many out beyond concrete jungle where you live is a vast wildness that in incomprehensible beauty rest source true power it was my task to go out find it, study it, learn its way to become it
Check out pedo/homo Colbert's video molesting a child.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXwny6VfFpg&t=42s … @realDonaldTrump @therealroseanne @RealJamesWoods @TheRealHublife #GreatAwakening #WeThePeople #QAnon #TarmacMeeting #NoRedactions @colbertlateshow

free will is an illusion, it's a deterministic universe
LOL! QM does not agree.
Bullshit. The movie is evil. 

It's literally about a religious woman cheating on her husband to have sex with Rachel McAdams. 

Nothing "beautiful" about that.

If your wife cheated on you to be with a woman, would you call that "beautiful" too?
I mean, if you’re gonna try to come for the plot, at least get the names right.
What name did I get wrong?
McAdams
How did I get her name wrong?
McAdams’ character is cheating with Weisz’s. And the story is important to tell bc McAdams’ character felt forced to deny her sexuality bc of religious rules. Telling someone they have to deny their attractions bc of some random thousands year old writing is what’s evil.
Either way both characters commit terrible adultery. 

You don't have to agree with Jewish law but it's certainly not evil. 

Adultery is awful and this movie finds a way to promote it and portray the adulters as victims. Absolutely disgusting.
Cool. Have fun with your opinions, and I’ll have fun going to see this on Friday. I might purchase an extra ticket for ya.
Then why do you advocate for politicians who want to control our lives with bigger, ever growing and more oppressive government?
Loved your monologue about Wolf’s #WHCD speech last night! The press had a temper tantrum because she (correctly) called them out for creating Donald and making millions of dollars- super annoying and hypocritical
Will Donald Trump receive the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing North and South Korea together?

Doubtful, but unscrambling the letters in "Nobel Peace Prize" does reveal a possible chapter in the Stormy Daniels saga:

"Epic bra peel zone".
Rike my peace dear!


Where is Ching Chong ding dong.
Just, shut up!!!
Your crush is showing, Stephen ;)
....ya got that right.
on my list!
I can’t wait for you to see Evie, written and directed by fellow Wildcat me! Unmasking the problem of child marriage in America with @UnchainedAtLast
Please consider having James Shaw, Jr on your show!  Exceptional young man who has done great community service!
Stormy Daniels attorney this week?  Wow a new low
she wants to be involved in making the world not see race as a skin color and people hate that. it's insane. she seems like a really beautiful person
Unless you’re Donald Trump. Then he has to be like you want him to be.
So you’re not a groupthinker? @StephenAtHome
rotflmfao... maybe watch a few of your monologues one more time... wtf?
I saw that at Tribeca earlier in the week.  I completely read the synopsis wrong and was expecting to see a buddy detective movie.  Technically, they became buddies, but Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson never went there.  Excellent movie overall.
You are a man of your word. You said on air with Rachel that you'd see the film - and did. 
Heard the interview on 
@NPR this morning. Can’t wait to see it.
A free plug? It must be a good movie.
Looking forward to your conversation with Rachel tonight! #MFF18 #Disobedience

Unless you’re named Kanye
Sounds like you're actually talking about Kanye's love for Trump. 
Oh I’m sure it’s actually “love” that he’s expressing (my new room m8) he reminds me of my mom tho with nagging at me about my weight or whatever then she’s nice to me because she feels bad... he does that too... he used to offer to get me donuts or McDonald’s.. abusive outward
I’m inward I keep it in most of the time... I’m real life anyways just like now.. I can’t get evicted... but he’s very outward same with my mom they’re both very OCD real neat freaks he just vacuumed again and on Tuesday and Thursday... go Susie homemaker 
I tried asking my old room m8 is I could move back in but her baby daddy daughter still lives there a few times a week... and nothing available yet on Craigslist so yeah... sort of stuck for now especially with no car I just gotta use my earbuds 
FREE WILL -
I thoroughly immersed myself in the beautiful story. Problem is it was a 100% false depiction of the Chasidic community.
Looking forward to the conversation this afternoon & then the movie afterwards #mff2018
So am i!
I love you @StephenAtHome and I don't care who knows it!
Is there any karate in it?
Would have never guessed you were an advocate of free will.
Oh, so it's a fantasy movie?
What are you doing for #EdBallsDay? I made a meatloaf in the shape of Ed's head.
Bacon! ok I don't know why I'm tweeting bacon but in some mysterious way it seems appropriate.
But you don't allow people to be themselves.  If they have a differing opinion you spew crappy jokes about them
Sounds lame.
I've watched "Walk Hard" three times today, but I'll check this out too.
A wonder beam of positivity, blowing my synapses into another dimension.

Thanks Steve!
And girls kissing 
No political joke , nice.
She is never going to marry you Stephen.
@kanyewest make a guest appearance?
How was Rachel McAdams?
Brilliant
Enough to earn an Academy Award nomination, you think? Hope she can get her second from this movie. I feel like she's underrated sometimes.
Too early to tell since l dont know who the competition will be. She was excellent. I'm bias. I love her
Me too! Hope she campaigns hard for a nomination.
