@cletus1969 lmaooo
I’ll add him to the list of people I can’t watch or hear.  It started a long time ago, but I just made it official.
I think they're a cult. If Trump would tell them a spaceship will pick them up they likely pack their stuff and wait for it. I have no hope for them.
I'd rather a spaceship pick me up than two bullets in the back of my head.
Wow this makes you guys losers, and reaching wayyyyyy to hard to try to get something out of nothing, #losers
bitch - it's a comedy show ;)

Haha.
Meanwhile  no one cares
Everyone with brains cares.
The Dumbing of America continues with out and out lies, misinformation, falsehoods, conspiracies and just plain made up stories. What happened to honesty, intelligence, facts, professional reports backed data? It's a fool's game that's paying big bucks?
Not before breakfast.
If ur a Catholic act like one
Fuck Hannity
hahahahaha!!!!
 awesome job 
WHERE is your neck @seanhannity?
That's probably where you hide truth & facts & sadly it turned your head into a blimp
To your video editors:
So Roman Polanski didn't rape that 13 year old?
Harvey Weinstein didn't sexually assault anyone either?
What about Woody Allen!?
All people that woman defended and all accused of sexual assault or rape.
One even admitted it, well more than one really...
#LockHimUp
Hahahahahaha!!!!!!
Sean stopped by the Bunny Ranch to see if any of these Ladies wanted to attend Church services with him.
Those cost MONEY?

BAAAHAHAHA!
This is the perfect time for a Jon Stewart appearance
It's ALWAYS a perfect time for a Jon Stewart appearance.  I miss him terribly...smartest man on TV


You are pointing a finger at him and four fingers point back at you. Stop blaming people and start LOOKING IN THE MIRROR.

Yes he is putting out the real facts!!
Sean is a great man.
Hillary Clinton killed Kennedy. 
I thought @tedcruz father killed Kennedy? 
Hillary IS Ted Cruz's father

@barroneg
Hannity is a propagandist tool.
Brilliant
I needed a laugh after being on the phone with comcast.  Thanks.


FAKE NEWS GOING AT IT, AND CREATING THEIR PROPAGANDA TRASH#!
Great work!
CIA Director MIKE POMPEO met with Kim Jong Un over Easter weekend. President Trump makes ex President Obama look like America's first Female President. 
The funny thing about that is that liberals know that it's true
@seanhannity Lumpy’s definitely gonna need his duech flute tonight...
Maddow here I come......
hannity , cohen, trump... oh, my
Who’s your lawyer Mr. Coal Bear? Oh wait, why would I care? All I see is back stabbing entertainers trying to steal each other’s audiences and sponsors. This is why I don’t listen to you Hollywood types when it’s time to vote!


I Can't Wait!,
Flipping hilarious 
God, I love you

Mr. Colbert you are a man with great talent.
Brilliant! 

Fingers crossed, the turd is circling the bowl.
He buried the lede. Hard.

And Hilary shouldn’t have been arrested? And Bill Clinton’s shouldn’t have resigned out of disrespect that he showed American
This video should trend. ROFLMAO
LOL
So funny!
...And tomorrow night on the Late Show, * Groping Joe Biden *

Classy
OUTSTANDING!!!
@LadyFoSho
What a fraud
Bahaha
Lol
Look at that bloated piece of crap #FireHannity

Just listened to a recording..Hannity says, " I never retained Cohen's services." Then goes on to say I assumed our conversations were protected by attorney/client privilege. What?You just said you were NOT a client. Hmmm.
@seanhannity

They have to fire this guy.  If they don't, they're complicite.  Imagine if THIS is what happened:  https://np.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/8cqbb1/sean_hannity_irl/dxhprwu/?context=1 …

#Hannity is a legend!
In his own mind...

That is just funny
Hahahahahaha!! Priceless!!!
This is the best.
Top notch, A1, First Place, Kudos,YOU WIN.
How does it feel being in the hot seat  Let’s see how long is it gonna take you to bullshit your way out of this
Fire hannity
Hey Hannity the fix is in
Oh man watch the progression of republicanism is in his face....
When will we know how much @seanhannity has earned in fixit moneys from Cohen for the propaganda @realDonaldTrump enjoyed on FoxNews?

LMAO! Well done. But which Kennedy? ;)
Yup that’s Hannity top reporting. Absolute Spanky looking dipshit for brains. Lols.

Perfect
He is being saying it all this time! Ha, ha, ha. The truth one way or another, will always come out.
Omg... 
sounds like Roger Stone
Sounds a accurate. I don't get why people bought into all the BS to begin with. No good has followed the 2016 election.

He. Has. The. Same. Expression. In. Every. Clip. 
Well, at least he's consistent? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Liberals are getting desperate. They already failed miserably with the whole phonetic Trump Russia Collusion BS.
Troll...
Sean Hannity
I love this so much!!!! Kudos to the editors involved.
Well done!
Sean Hannity refused to disclose that Michael Cohen is his lawyer all the while he was bashing the FBI's legally approved raid of Cohen's home, office and hotel room.

Free speech is not always pretty!

Love hannity!!!!
what a world..
EXCLUSIVE:  Michael Cohen the moment the FBI raid began.
#MAGA
lies

Do Fox viewers even know what he’s been up to?? There’s been nothing about this scum bag on Fox online. Do these people never change the channel????
Blah blah blah

Hannity is bad ass, nobody is falling for this attempt to discredit him lol.

Wow, didn't realize Colbert's show was still on.
"Hillary Clinton killed Kennedy" 
Hannity right now...

How does that hair even work?
Hilarious!
Oh damnity, Hannity.

Stephen Colbert just dropped the  
Like the old saying goes, you lie with trump you wake up with STD's and needing to hire a lawyer
Har
This is a slippery slope when lawyers have to start providing lists of their clients. Is anything privileged anymore? Government overreaching? What does Shawn or any other client have to do w/ Mrs.Daniels ?
Thank you.
Lol
.....Collusion...
That’s some funny stuff right there!
Brilliant.
Yooooo found of pic of the Late Show, looks like you threw quite a bit of intersectionality in there. Great work!

Thank you Stephen for giving me something to laugh about (with glee) after the news horrors of the day. 

@seanhannity
Karma is a trump
I've been watching his corrupt ads meltdown all day. F that guy.
Let's send thoughts and prayers to all the people who had to watch an unimaginable amount of Hannity to make that!
Do what I do: soak my head in lysol for 1 hour
Shaub, how much longer do you think you will last at Fox? I am sure you think the owner of Fox is your dad, huh?
B R I L L A N T
