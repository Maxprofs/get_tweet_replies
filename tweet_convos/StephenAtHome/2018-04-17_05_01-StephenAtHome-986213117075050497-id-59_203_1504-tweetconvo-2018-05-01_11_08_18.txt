We need an all star show on President Trump featuring Stephen Colbert, John Stewart and John Oliver!!!
we need an all star independent vounsel to nail Hillary& Obama to the wall for all their illegal activities
Can I just say how much I LOVE YOU!!  Lately you give me much more laughter then I’ve ever had. 
Okay, here's a question for you: why would you pay off a pornstar, even though your President is an honest braggart without restraint? I don't like Trump the least, but to attack him on this shit or even insinuate that he keeps this shit a secret just seems plain wrong to me.
Stephen is awesome!
She wants more $.  #prostitute #badmom
Late night comedy writers are going to get lazy.  All they need now is to transcribe the news.  I do like the movie titles.
Was it your Mother Stephen who Hannity was pounding on the side?



Love....love...  
Can't stop laughing!!!!!!
Funny that your castigating the “guy who paid off Stormy Daniels”. Stormy D whom willing took the money and signed the agreement. Even if the porn star turned hooker did suffer under the Orange Chimp she’s not a bit trustworthy having gone back on the deal she made. That’s Irony
It just gets better and better...
So Hannity chose not to share
That Cohen was his consigliere,
Critics agree
It stinks, ethically…
gave Hannity legal advice many years before Trump was president..what was there for him to reveal? Cohen as a lawyer has a duty an oath to never reveal or discuss his clients unless forced to by the courts. He was so and did reveal Hannity's name..very simple, nothing there idiot
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. .@FoxNews @RealJamesWoods  @PrisonPlanet @WomenforTrump  @seanhannity
Isis has surrendered, Kim jon un of North Korea is capitulating, Russia is quiet, and soon you guys making fun of the strongest man in the world will surrender!

Did your BFF Podesta the Molesta make this dish for you?
Lock him up
Thank you brilliant you!!!!

And 2 think Kimmel ended his feud with Hannity already.!
If @seanhannity wasnt paying @MichaelCohen212, then perhaps $$$ was flowing the other way
And ?

Why is paying an ex lover to not go to the media illegal? I don’t get it
Federal election law.  Duh!
It's, politics, pure and simple... well, maybe not pure.
You call that trouble?

Try holding on to the presidency when nobody but the Russians and Iranians likes you.

It takes a lot of fake news to get both the altLeft and altRight on your side.
The altLeft...
5. These Staged broadcasts, "propaganda seeding" will continue so long as deceitful #TankieFronts avoid any costs!

 #FewNotice the global networking & destruction these 100% …
The altRight
Hey, we miss Brain Fight!
Loll!!!!!
Keep it coming Colbert.  You'll make Hannity number one on cable news!  Lol!!!!
And? Still not saying what, if anything, he did wrong. Raiding lawyers' office for late night attacks on people. This is pathetic.
This segment was amazing. And oddly arousing.
@seanhannity is a clown
 You guys rock !
He paid this
I only love my bed and my momma I'm sorry TYPE BEAT
