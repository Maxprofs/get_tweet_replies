This tweet continues to age well, don't you think?
Such irony...
Such schadenfreude...
Getting closer to full ripeness now...
#MuellerIsComing
Just like like your boss
There's always a tweet, isn't there?

Lol true dat 
It's like you can look into the future! AMAZING!
This didn’t age well.
Morning Sarah. For once we agree.
Hey @realDonaldTrump your spokeswoman says you’re LOSING! It looks like she’s finally cracking under your enormous pile of stupidity. SAD
How's California?
Fantastic! How’s #fartcatching? #trump #fartcatcher
Lol
how much do you regret this
This aged well...
Brilliant Sarah. Just brilliant. Have you by chance showed this to your boss @realDonaldTrump ?

Stupid woman.
Somebody oughta tattoo this idiotic statement right onto her rectum...and I don't suppose we're gonna have a flood of volunteers for THIS job.
This tweet keeps getting better with age.
The Karma machine is working over time.
@PressSec    Ouch!
@realDonaldTrump #FridayFeeling #FlashbackFriday
When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing https://twitter.com/politicalwire/status/794255050243801090 …
We all completely agree. Tell your boss to resign.
This certainly did not age well. Poor dear. She has a real problem
Remember these words Sarah Honey BooBoo?’nn

Sarah!!!!  This Tweet is soooo cute!!! Do you wish you could take it back? Delete it??!!     Nahhh... let’s leave it up.
Liked, but not liked.
Haha heard!

Can you do anything that doesn't involve every word coming out of that ugly pig face of yours being ridiculously large lies?
 Oh my sides!  I cant breathe! 
You really, really, really, really need to delete this one now  #MuellerIsComing
So Sarah Huckabee Sanders, what say you now?
Donald Trump is attacking FBI agents - and Donald Trump is losing big time
#TrumpMustGo
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @KellyannePolls @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @GrassleyPress
In other words you're saying outright that that president is losing.
True then. True now. Only let's add: when ur pardoning people who attack FBI agents, ur losing.
You still feel this way?
This tweet is like a fine wine, every day it just keeps getting better.
Does this apply to Presidents?
^ This tweet is really one for the ages.
Another of the ‘this tweet has aged well’ category, eh?
this tweet is *italian chef kiss*
Ahh, wouldn't that be particularly relevant as @POTUS  @realDonaldTrump is doing exactly that?
Yes Sarah, this tweet has aged exceptionally well. And it shall live on during the Trump impeachment hearings. Thanks
It was bound to boomerang back, but this boomerang seems to have been thrown in space or anyplace it can loop around endlessly. 

I hope all of her attacks become as prescient as this one.
A golden oldie.
Thank you for admitting the #LiarInChief @realDonaldTrump is losing! Good for you!

When the "heads" of the FBI are criminals Americans are losing. 
@HaroldLang16 @MichaelAvenatti @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @CNN @AC360 trump and administration tweets do not age well. 
So... what does that make you?
Oh Sarah, this tweet, like so many of your utterances, did not age well. How do you do it? Sycophant.
Still feel that way? Press Secretary Liar?  
No sweetie your Boss is losing. Check the score,sheet
Bahahahahahaha
Because nothing but  comes out. #LiesLiesLies
Well well... didn't that come back to bite you LIAR SARAH!! Lol..  @PressSec


Hi Sarah, just wondering how your grifting ass feels about this tweet?  No pressure.  Answer when you're ready.
lol
Accurate for once.
It’s a classic.  
You're really ugly when you lie Sarah!  Are you making daddy happy?
Remember this tweet?
This tweet isn’t aging well Sarah is it?
This is a great tweet. And so true.
Isn't your boss mad at you for speaking the truth?

No kidding, Trump is sure acting guilty.
We still agree.
Omg, @StephenAtHome made my head pop when he retweeted this.

@SarahHuckabee, when you're attacking former and current FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing!  Make sure your buddy knows.

@Comey, can't wait to read your book.  Be blessed.
@realDonaldTrump 
Uh Oh.
@politicalwire Sarah, please further your thoughts on this well-aged tweet..... I'll wait......
...
CAN'T take anything you say SERIOUSLY!!!

Could you RT this a few more times, Sarah? Say it just a little louder, please.
LMAO

It's essentially like having a wild animal trapped in a corner and the only thing it can do is to attack.  Trying to bite those that have it backed into a corner so the animal might find a way out of entrapment.

Oh Sarah, YOU ARE SO FUCKIN RIGHT.... Donald Trump is under Criminal Investigation & lots of Lawsuits against him. Trump is Guilty Of All Charges & Losing.....
This tweet aged well don’t you think Sarah? You work for the most vile, disgusting, embarrassing president EVER!
Oooh, sweet irony
This aged quite well...and will continue too
It's glorious. They keep getting self owned by past tweets.
This has aged well Sarah 
Where is your profile pic? Laughable when people tear down others looks.  Or is the dog pic really you.
@realDonaldTrump
You ARE talking about #Dolt45, aren't you?
This aged well
Wouldn’t you agree @POTUS ?
So True
For once, I agree with you.  And yes, words do have meaning.
I agree
That is SO true!
Might want to explain that to the illegitimate @POTUS though. He doesn't seem to get it.
#TweetsThatHaunt
Unless you're @realDonaldTrump !?!?!
i agree Sarah!
Nostradamus would be proud of your skills...
Couldn't agree more.
Boy, has her tune ever changed! I must have missed that verse.
This wears well. Thanks, @PressSec !!
Classic
@presssec #SpinThis
Ironic
Comment again now please. And BTW: how do you sleep at night, especially as a mother and wife? #ImpeachTrump
There are two FBIs.  Sara is speaking of the rank and file.  The POTUS is against weaponized FBI, leftovers from the Obama administration.
Hey Sarah can you say it louder for the people in the back?
Just had to look at this again for a laugh. Funny not funny

And now your boss is doing the exact same thing. Oops.
@realDonaldTrump 
@DonaldJTrumpJr @RepAdamSchiff @RepMaxineWaters
This aged well!!
Yes Sarah Sanders @PressSec, seems #Trump, #GOP, @GOPChairwoman & @WhiteHouse must be loosing it as you ALL are attacking the brave men/women of @FBI!
Does your hypocrisy know any bounds?  If your boss said the sky is green today, what color do you see when you look up outside?
Yeah, that's true. How's that working out?

Hmmm? That’s what 45 is doing.

Is that why slick Willy Clinton was such a looser?
During his  network TV interview, former FBI Chief " Slippery" James Comey likened his ex-boss Donald "Horse Patootie" Trump to a mob boss.

 However, rather than the Godfather, Don Corleone, he should go down in history as the Oddfather, Don Fullabaloney.
Can't thank you enough for these words of wisdom
Twitter is truly the gift that keeps on giving.
You are correct so why does Donnie keep doing it??? Oh right he is losing!
Lurch

Statement from former AG Loretta Lynch on Comey 
When you defend the indefensible your already losing
Guess that makes you a loser Miss Sanders.
Oh Sarah...remember when you said this? We do
There’s always a Tweet
Care to comment?
Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!

I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!

Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus!” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
Justice will prevail.....it always do.

Animal feces was reportedly found in several brand name make-up products, including Kylie and MAC.

I guess for the hapless consumers of these products, there's a new meaning to the term "shit-faced".
I have to agree with @PressSec 
Don't you @realDonaldTrump ?
Attacking the FBI when you are under investigation...
So much LOSING! 
SAD!

YOU ARE a #FingMoron !   And #BoxORocksStupid ! ! !

How did you ever have offspring ?

@SHSanders45 @PressSec @WhiteHouse

Being part of the conspiracy, Miss Sanders, will get you in jail, too.
Oh my. People who live in glass houses shouldn't tweet.


#HYPOCRITE #LIAR

Proverbs 6:16-17
There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a #LYING TONGUE, And hands that shed innocent blood,
This is hilarious. I'm sure you'll call it fake news if anybody questions you about it.

Wow once again a trump administration member's tweet from the past did not age well #TheResistance #ImpeachTrump #GOPHypocrites
@realDonaldTrump The why are Trump, you, and the GOP attacking the FBI and DOJ?  Losing much? #TheResistance #BlueWave2018 #ResignNow  #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives #FBR
Hucka, remember this tweet?  Loser.
Are you still standing by this statement???
There is a special place in hell for fake Christians who equate God with this monster in the same sentence. When you can shove their own words up their ass, they get a special suite.
You couldnt be more correct, Uncle Fester.
I sure do believe this tweet now. So much winning get tired of it all. Thank for the 8 dollar tax cut per week but my gas went up 0.20 a gallon which now caused all my food to go up. Everything is now going up including other taxes

YUP @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @VP @KellyannePolls #MAGA
Really?
Was Donald Trump's post-attack proclamation of "Mission Accomplished" an attempted timely distraction from his scandals, including the "pee tape"?

Maybe, considering that unscrambling the letters in "Mission Accomplished" gives you "Lo, coincides a piss, hmm?"
Seriously.  Consider deleting this one.  Are you sticking with the lie that that Trumpty Dumpty had nothing to do with Stormy Daniels?  OK.  You just keep sticking with it.  See how well that goes.
Aged well 
Hey.  READ THIS AGAIN.
YEP.
Please read that again out loud so we can all hear it. #VoteThemOut #Sarahuckabeeisanembarrassment #TrumpRussia #TrumpResign #25thAmendmentNow
Remember this???
How do you get up and look at yourself in the mirror each morning?
Change ur mind recently Sarah?
Wow, Sarah, you have amazing psychic powers!

Yep, seems that way doesn't it?  Especially when you're now defending those attacks yourself these days
I love this tweet!!!!
LOL
Hey needledick...I hope Trump fires you...The world will be a better place..dueces
Tissue for your issue?
First of alll...show me a comedian
Well this tweet has aged BEAUTIFULLY, @PressSec

Welp! THIS tweet aged POORLY! 
This tweet has agreed so well. I wonder if @SarahHuckabee will be in the criminal investigation?
You're #LOSING alright!! #TrumpColluded #tRumpIsBeingINVESTIGATED #LIAR #GOPLies #embarrassedbytheGOP #embarrassedbyTRUMP #crookedTRUMP #lockhimUP #Impeachment #25thAmendmentNow #WeThePeople deserve better NOW! #CleanTheGOPOut2018 #BlueTsunami 
Ha ha ha ha
Classic Sarah with the @gop double standard.
History repeating itself...  tick tock, tick tock...  time for tRump to do the Nixon walk of shame!
The FBI “broke in” to Michael Cohen’s office, hotel, residence, etc. These FBI rank and file agents are an “attack” on our country. 
-Donald Trump.
