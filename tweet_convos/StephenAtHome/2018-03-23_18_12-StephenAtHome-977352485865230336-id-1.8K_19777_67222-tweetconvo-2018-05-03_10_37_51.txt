Thought for sure he’d show up...just to see what a crowd of almost 1m people looks like. But...guess I’m wrong about him. @AuntLulie @Alllwftopic @michellebhasin @Mahogany1992 @granisnark12 @CeciliaLisa3033 @alexespind @wonderfullone @TheCentryst
He’s in Mar a Largo....no chance he would show up.....I wish the Obamas would.....they live nearby.....
I’ll bet that at least one of them will...probably @MichelleObama most likely at the concert.
It’s full day local coverage here......
Same on MSNBC
Yep Joy and Lawrence will be down here.....
She did ‘All In’ tonight.
Yep great show...luv Maxine Waters...
You should see the billboard that we put up on the road to Mara-la-go talk to @TrueFactsStated


These are going up around the country-please chip in here to help fund. http://maddogpac.com  
Meh 
Please tell me there will be marchers headed for Mar-a-Lago 
Oh yes. Starting at Dreher Park and to Mar A Largo.
It's hard to fathom how selfish and slimy our president is.
Every time I hear the word president next to his name gives me the creeps.
Not one time, have I ever called him the President. He is NOT my President.
I hear you. Not my president either!
Trump is afraid of any group but his base.  He's not president of the American people...he is president of the Alt-right.  These kids deserve his presence...they should have his support!  $30 million, whether from the NRA or Russia, speaks volumes about his allegiance.
Sadly his base are reality show watchers, porn stars and playboy bunnies. Can we talk abt human trafficking? DJT standing up for children is hilarious, he only cares abt himself.
Seriously Beth? Do listen to what you say
#Botblock. This is fun
I’d be so impressed if he could actually run. He’d probably be like: “I’m the fastest runner of all time. Believe me. I’m like such a tremendous runner. My runs are so highly rated. Believe me.”
As I read this his voice is playing in my head... Sad!

#bonespurblubberbag 
Now there’s a hashtag

(Kinda hard to read I know but #rump deserves no capitals)
Glad to lend my creative contribution. You added your touch. 
Yes, we all know exactly who we are talking about. I was hoping that would get picked up?  Anything to irritate that bag of blubber and bonespurs works for me. Carry on.
Thanks!
he's chicken. He's orange, but also..yellow.
C’mon! You know him!
I found a photo of Donald on his way to his golf course.
Lol. 
Bone spurs, so 
They don't seem to limit his ability to play golf.
Another $3 million down the drain. @realDonaldTrump "I'll be too busy working to play golf." Bullshit #VoteThemOut2018 #ImpeachTrump #VoteGOPOut
But, but... he works "for free".

@realDonaldTrump running? 
The Big Orange is slinking out of town like the rat that he is.
“Somewhere in a lonely Mar-a-Lago room, a man is realizing that eternal fate has turned its back on him. It’s 2:00a.m.” - Twilight Zone, Golden Earring

He’s a coward! Plus for him it’s golf over country
It depends on the country. Golf over America, of course. Russia, I'm not so sure about.
Remember the reset button Hillary presented to Russia? I guess not.
Relevance?
It would be amazing if they faked the DC plan, and swarmed Mar-a-Lago instead.
He can't even run, not towards or away from anything.
You already know that.
He'll roll then, like an orange
This would be a bad day to have another lunch with Wayne LaPierre

Who did you think you were talking to?
He’s a draft dodging coward
He is a coward!
DT has to run away from tomorrow's March and hide in his own swamp with his 'old school' cronies.
Coward in Chief
Trump goes to Florida & Florida kids go to Washington - BEST TRADE EVER!
He doesn't even have the guts to face kids armed with their rights let alone a gun.
He is a coward in every sense of the word.

Typical coward
There's a pretty big march going on in Miami right now. He can run but he can't hide.
Niiiiiice ... bringing it to his doorstep 
Not surprised. He won’t face the common people, he’d rather hide away behind his estate and private guard. We are total banana  republic now.

@realDonaldTrump says a lot of things
And all of it nonsensical psycho-babble.
he simply rambles on and on.........repeating himself time and again.  scary to listen to
He's like Rainman and Sarah Palin all wrapped up into one.
Give him a little credit, he's behaving rationally for once. He's running away from everyone when they're mad at him.
All americas mad at him why not move countries then?
Because it's OUR country and we're taking it back.  
PS Your English isn't perfect, keep practicing.
Theres a reason no one likes donald trump and you americans have to suffer with him its fine taking america back just you have to wait for re election cuz us brits aint taking him off ya
Cough cough brexit cough cough.

Sorry, something got stuck in my throat. I meant to say "brexit."

We don't have a monopoly on shooting ourselves in the foot.
And what a coincidence that Cambridge Analytica was involved in that, too......
Oh yeah, I did hear about that. Not sure how down the rabbit hole their interactions with that mess go, though.
We both have unperfect countries difference is u have trump we dont
Liar. Hypocrite. Coward.
He can run but he can't hide. Oh wait, he's too large to run or hide. Oh well, I'm sure they'll find him in FL.
His golfing while Rome burns is going to be featured in what is written about him and his “presidency” in the history books.
To hell with DC, next March should be at Mar A Lago
I'd love to see a "surprise" march pop up at mar-a-lago, in anticipation of him avoiding the march in washington
Time to move the March to the Winter White House.
Cranial bone spurs.
Biggest snowflake of all @realDonaldTrump
I don't know about you, but I for one am glad he's *not* running towards the kids.
He's a coward.
Coward! #MarchForOurLives
Yeah, go and hide at your golf resort you sissy coward. What a waste of skin and air.
And hair.
HEY! WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH HAIR?!?! lol
I was just rhyming with air and trump's hair is a disaster!
I know, I know. Just poking for fun. Nice rhyme, btw.

Cadet Bone Spurs says what he thinks his clueless base will believe
Trump's Clueless Base is the Minority! WE are the MAJORITY!#HellHathNoFury #TrumpRussia #TrumpColluded #TrumpObstructedJustice #ProtectMueller #FBR #THERESISTANCE
lmao!!!
Priceless...
Totally. & Hi! 
HOWDY THERE!
Howdy over there! Snow melted just like nitging ever happened... Spring. Next: baseball... 
*nothing. lol.
I still have quite a bit of snow here... snow & whopping areas of mud lol So eww lol
Mudslides!!!
Ol Trump just never seems to get it, does he? Our last “real President” would have stayed in DC.  #MarchForOurLives
and this is the, person, that stated he'd run into a bldg with NO weapon to confront an armed gunman..........yet left DC before future voters get there HIS future does NOT look good...!!!!!!
He’s an effing coward- Cadet Bone Spurs is playing golf... 
Avoidant personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder.Those affected display a pattern of severe social anxiety, social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation, and avoidance of social interaction. #youmrpresident
It's the bone spurs again, isn't it?
What a coward
If Trump was even half a man he'd be out there marching WITH those kids.
Well, by that description, we know he won't be there....
Only if they look like his daughter.
The Farting “President”
Trump probably doesn't want to be in the same zip code as Melania when 60 Minutes airs on Sunday.
Trump probably has some made up event planned so he can bill the government AGAIN for his trip there. We've paid the Trump organization millions for him to fu@king golf! 
The #TrumpBase supports this BS

Let him run to #MaraLago he would just make #MarchForOurLives about him
Unless there's a sale on Big Macs or pornstars the nacho nazi ain't running anywhere. #facts
Will be marching in the rain in Nashville. So proud of those kids!

Stephen We know Trump is what he likes to forcefully Grab on women
Bill rapes em and Hillary drags em through the mud and Democrat media (led by Stephen , CNN, WaPo and NYT) cheers her on for 30 years
You ever get tired of being full of shit?
He is scared out of his mind about these Parkland students who stand up for what they believe in!
They stand up for what someone else tells them to believe in
Wrong
Great opinion, I’ll be sure to stick that in the “ I don’t give a fuck about your one worded tweet” right next to the “ been blocked by smarter” file
Yup, still wrong
At least you stick to your guns

 That’s okay @StephenAtHome We are Marching here in Parkland as well Mar A Lago isn’t so far away...
A real president would walk with our kids. Shame on you @Donald
I wonder if he took his Coke ordering button with him?
No need for caption you get the picture
Hard to like but its so true.
Yes, also it was hard to post, but he just doesn’t care
.@RepErikPaulsen is also great at running away from voters. He's a coward, just like Donald. That's why we're replacing him. #ReplacePaulsen #MN03 #VoteThemOut

Video of Trump rushing into a hailstorm of gun fire to save children.
Every damn time. @realDonaldTrump proves himself weak, a coward, waving his button on tv and at safe rallies yet when it comes time to man up, he runs for cover. Sad.
He doesn’t want to make the kids feel badly because his inaugural crowd was the biggest crowd in the history of any event in Washington PERIOD. (Until the impeachment party).

Scared of courageous teenagers. Or maybe scared of Stormy interview.
He is a simple minded man with no spine and money in his veins. Back in the late 50's early 60"s we thought the "The Blob" was bad
This march is so big I guarantee West Palm Beach will feel its impact.
How can he face them after his cowardly backing down from doing anything at all about making them safe.
He's afraid of the kids. He has to go to his safe space.
I wish we can say that we have a real intelligent, and brave president; but instead, look what we got....Trump It can’t get lower than that....
Golf is more important than kids on a march for their lives.  Good to know.  #ChickenTrump .
He’s a joke that already got too old.
...and tax payers once again pay for this bone spur to fly to FL to hide and sell the government.
COWARD
I intend to be with the students & their families. For a tiny salary I am prepared to die for my students. Trump ran from a heckler. Courage only comes when you care about others in your soul. Teachers are the conscience of America, & they are treated as if they are baby sitters.
Thank You @StephenAtHome for All You Do, Informing The Electorate About What is Actually Going On and What Direction We Need To Go In November #BlueWaveComing2018
His bone spurs are acting up

That fat fuck's not running anywhere...
LOOKING FOR MAR-A-LAGO HOOKERS   I MEAN STAFF
He took another bone spur deferment.
President Bone spur ran away to play golf. Sad! @DumpTrump
What would you expect from the coward- in- chief!#midterms!
@realDonaldTrump is hiding out (at OUR expense). Aside the fact that he's a coward, he no doubt got out of Dodge as a big "F*ck You" to the teenagers of America. He has no soul. #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain #BanAssaultWeapons #GunReformNow #NRAkills #Resist

Huh? These kids are REALLY make a statement about gun control & that baby boy president is too afraid to face them. Typical bully who is also a coward. :(
That's how Trump gets his exercise. He Runs! Runs from the draft, runs from kids who #MarchForOurLives  He runs to NRA, Runs into Putin's arms.
Putin made Trump his choirboy
Yup! Trump loves Putin!
Bone spurs is a medical condition in which there is a lack of ability to run forward. Backward running however is unimpaired.
Bugs the hell out of me when people think this old goat will pivot, his BS aren't promises but ill fated bad omens, evil is before us. #WakeUpAmerica

He meant the kids in the dressing room at the Teenage Miss Universe Pageant.
And these kids are only armed with their 1A rights. Go figure!
BOOM!
A real leader would be out front dealing with this catastrophe of gun violence we’re living through. He golfs at a fancy club instead. He is a coward and unfit to be president.
#NeverAgain
Many of them will be voting and they will remember who stood by them and had their backs. Trump and the NRA are oceans away from these kids.
Grab them by the Trump.
Trump is afraid of the Parkland kids. Shame on him.
45, being a sociopath, is incapable of feeling shame or empathy. That is the problem. 

He is like an alien doing a bad impersonation of a human.
Correct.
Don't worry, the kids are coming for you!
Trump is such a wast of skin and water
Trump fucking off to Mar-a-Lago the weekend the #MarchForOurLives  hits DC tells you everything he is thinking about how serious he is about changing gun control legislation.
#puttPuttPresident
Running you say ... did you forget the bone spoors ?!!!
 #worstpresidentever

There will be a group marching in West Palm right towards his place in palm beach so he didn’t escape it totally.
He only runs into locker rooms at beauty pageants and then only if they’re stocked with underage Ukrainian girls
Running from the kids because trump lied to them too about the tougher background checks.   Why does trump still have supporters
New color for the TRAITOR is YELLOW!!! Does Yellow & ORANGE Match??? #ImpeachTraitor
Spot on ! His announcement on Transgender Troops also was timed to deflect the coverage of the  march today oh and yes his misdeeds with a porn star 
When has he ever kept his word
#MakeAmericaGunsafeAlready #AustraliaIsTheModel As a side note Mr. Colbert, since Fox News won this past presidential election, I would really love to vote for @colbertlateshow with  @LastWeekTonight as the running mate in 2020.
Now you knew #45 was not going to put himself in a position to look out a WH residence window and personally witness MORE gun violence protesters than people who attended his inauguration!
Can’t believe Trump will leave DC when the city will be loaded with kids affected by GUNS. He should be addressing them. SHAME on him!
I said it before and I’ll say it again they should march at Mar A Lago.
Yeah, he can't face up to those Parkland students.  Cadet Bone Spurs is afraid of the criticism AND I'm sure Melania's not to happy with him right now.
So, I heard that melania flew to mar-a-lago by herself... does that mean that the American taxpayers pay  for them to fly seperately... separate security as well? That probably costs a bit eh...
He's afraid of the kids, knows he's outmatched intellectually and just wants to hit balls.
Mar-a-Lago is a gun free zone. Therefore one of the most dangerous places in the nation. Trump is a hero when he goes there without fear.
Coward.  Probably a bone spurs issue
He’s a coward.
You have him mistaken with Roy Moore.

I just don't get golf. I've tried it, even took a class. It's just...meh.
More like
@realDonaldTrump
Great sign. Great cactus.
I think what Trump said is that he’ll only run toward children in order to use them as human shields,

to protect him from getting shot at it.

In fact, I suspect Trump would hide under a dead body before trying to protect anyone other than himself. 

#trumpisacoward
**at**

Gdamn typos :)
He just went to FL to watch #60Minutes with FLOTUS

Had to know this was coming!
This is the only reason why he signed that bill. He wanted to go away.
Shud picket in front of that dumpy building. At least his wife gets to stay there with her son for Easter breaks and chubby fly’s back  to d.c.
Why would he hang around for protestors? The solution to the school violence is a "simple" one. TSA type screening at the entrance. But naw, easier to fake cry liberal tears on camera while asking for Twitter followers.
Dal? Member KKK or NRA???
Vote him out

Considering his attitude, he's probably just scared that someone might grab him. What goes around, etc.
On his way to MaraFraudO he got to drive past this beauty.
Looks like the Hotel California.

If only they would refuse to let Donald leave....
If only he’d just run towards a wood chipper....
Hey Steve why don’t u help change rot in culture ? That’s the prob not the guns ?
Does this sum it up, Stephen.
#MarchForOurLives
Pretty sure he would suffer a massive heart attack from the mere thought of running
Let’s be honest here he wouldn’t run toward or away he’d take a golf cart.
No problem, the kids will find him.
,Donald Trump is hiding at his private club and golf course today. Because he's an emotionally-fragile coward
Little man trump, why so afraid of the children???

Oh right, because Russian backed @NRA helped you cheat to win electoral college & @GOP can’t win without them.

I get it... freaking cowards!
His bone spurs are acting up. Cut him some slack. Wait... no, don’t. Give him hell.
Im pretty sure he either has no clue its a march or thinks its the Black Lives Matter ppl.

OK March moved to @MarALago
He's nothing more than a #COWARDINCHIEF
#SOSAD
#IMPEACHTRUMPNOW
#KICKHISSORRYASSOUTOFTHEWHITEHOUSE
Trump is a:
Broken promises from trump.  I'm says it mildly.  He should be marching with these incredible students.  Shame on him! @realDonaldTrump
#IWillMarch #MarchForOurLives
Hope he gets a birds eye view of the new billboard, Impeach him now.
That's okay; the kids have got this:
Please note Trump is not a man of his word.
He’s a scared child.  Can’t handle being around those smarter than him.
Yeah because with the little you pay the schools they kids would never be able to figure out just where that gaudy hell hole of yours is.
@realDonaldTrump could shown support, but he runs instead #truecolors #MarchForOurLives
Coward

He always runs away...
All the students took a day off from school... And went home to play Grand Theft Auto. #true but #sadbuttrue
"The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood." 

#45_the_COWARD
#smallSizeOfTrump
Good one.
Well he did once. Into a Miss Teen USA dressing room.
The second largest #NeverAgain concentration will be #MarchForOurLives throughout Florida

And without a weapon! Such bravery.
So true ...
About to run that city broke for the security every weekend...
During his campaign talking shit about Obama’s golf habit..
What a two faced asshole...
Am I right?
Did he make Mar-a-Lago in the image of his beloved Beverly Hills Hotel Bungalow?
asking for a friend?
#chickenTrump
Presumably though anyone heading towards Florida is - statistically - running towards the guns.
Yeah go hide.
Stephen. Please stop. You’re better than this.  Please become a comedian again and stop lecturing us. If you do that I’d be happy to watch your show again.
He’s just funny anymore.  And when Trump is gone, and he needs to be funny, he will lose everything.
I hope that trump or no trump these late night hosts remember that their job is to entertain us and give us a common culture. I think they’re being woke but really they just fomenting division. I know they mean well and their heart is in the right place but it hurts to watch
Comrade Bone Spurs a.k.a. @realDonaldTrump cannot run though.

Also because he's a fat bastard.

People like Miller, they are chicken shits

They run scared very easily

Miller is the worst of the worst
But he will watch @MSNBC (not FOX :) to know for sure how many ppl really came to Washington!
He's a chump.

BREAKING: Newly release footage of Trump aka Cadet Bonespurs running in unarmed to stop a mass shooting. 
March against the pollution, smart meters, surveillance, high college tuition, all the wars we are in, kids being stolen from their families by CPS, medical kidnapping...but marching so you can lose your rights to bear arms is just misguided. Don't throw your rights away!
I've marched against many things, even got pics to prove it... No one is taking citizens guns away. Stop with the same fear mongering/ guilt crap. Well regulated means being ruled by rules and laws. They want better laws to try prevent this from happening again and again. Logic.
It isn't fear mongering. These kids were carrying signs for repeal of the second amendment. . Misguided.  You want to turn in your gun---have at it. But most don't want to. The gun laws are fine--it is the FBI, local police, schools and psychological profession who failed the kid
They can carry signs that say whatever they want, but in reality that will never happen.
It won't happen. But the fact that kids are protesting to have rights removed is frightening to those who value freedom and see the slide toward extreme control in every aspect of our society. Indoctrination. Telling kids they know more than adults etc
Not really. People say a lot of things. They might ban certain guns, but they won't ban or take all guns from the people. Not sure how old you are, but they keep repeating this fear tactic ever few years when a shootings happens. Laws may change, but no ones coming for your guns.
This truly should shock anyone 
Hello!!!!
GM Sweetie
Its afternoon for me!!! 
He is a coward. Any other president would have spoken out and would have been at the Shithole, formerly known as the White House.
While they are under the gun, he waddled off to play with his balls.
Runs from kids but not from Putin?
Seriously,  can we have a grown up debate about The 2nd Amendment? 
#repealandreplace
Yeah didn’t he say he’d be the law and order president? What about term limits? Anyone believe the swamps getting drained? Are you tired of wining too?
Burn!!!!!!!
They had to drive him, since his bone spurs were too painful for him to run.
Stephen Cole bear is Dennis Rodman’s cock holster
Hey Colbert...remember when you had Trump on your show and had the audience cheer for him and talked about how everyone loves him?  I do.
I wish about 800,000 of them would have stormed mar-a-lago.
