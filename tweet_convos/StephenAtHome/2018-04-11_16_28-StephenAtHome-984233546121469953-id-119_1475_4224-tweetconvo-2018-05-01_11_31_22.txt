Prickly pear ?! Hmm 
Yep. Delicious!
Agree ( not many appreciate them).
More for us.

What more can be said, oh, it’s about time, he’s taking up valuable SPACE!
Do you think @realDonaldTrump and @GOP will return Paul Ryan’s soul and spine on the way out?
Nope he won't even get his balls back.
#CowardlyRyan
He is a good man, with a wonderful family.
Courage he never had , and soft he is . The Republicans are done 
Creepy Dad RYAN is driving up the deficit a trillion dollars and splitting town before the 99% find out they’ve been robbed. Doubt he did that to impress his kids.
Clear a short film....

Steven is a "0"
Never watch any late night zeros but this truly shows failed speaker's spineless character
Ryan was who we thought: In it for the tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations. He’s just surrendered his last chance to destroy Social Security and Medicaid/Medicaid - and his fond wish to watch the poor and elderly dying in poverty. Oh, well. We all have our dreams.
sums p. ryan up perfectly
The late show is a  "0". Saying fake mess like the fake news CNN.
The Hate Show with Stephen Colbert!

Paul your 'career' was very damaging.  you and your cronies are wreaking havoc on this country. Hopefully youll make ammends but going away forever is a good start.
Oh have you heard about Larry Sinclair's site. He had sex and drugs with Obama in 1999, when he was a senator. Gosh so much sad news!

He wanted the U.S. to fall, because he was treated bad, along with his Mom, so he says.
@SpeakerRyan on retirement, “I have accomplished much of what I came here to do!” Which part? You’re supposed to rid of our nation’s debt. Instead, according to CBO report released on 4/9/18, the tax reform @GOP passed will increase deficit by $13 Trillion Thanks a lot #PaulRyan
Nope wrong, President Trump has gotten us trillions from not sending money overseas.
Well thank God no one can say,he didn't gave the nation fair warning. Clarity of intent has always been heard and seen. To me there's just authentic feeds. God bless him in his future chosen pursuit. Lots of love and respect for sure.@mancallchicago



Good riddance lol
Nailed it! Well, his legs are usually farther apart so practically nailed it.
Feel free to have an audience sing along.
He was brave enough to leave us stuck with the #PaulRyanDeficit Wish he'd stand up to Trump now, but I won't hold my breath for that. Maybe he'll at least ask fake @foxnews to #FireHannity? just kidding
Fox news is the only straight news on.
Please consider having Robert Reich as a guest on your show. Please, please, please?
Wouldn't he be in his second term as VP if Romney had won? Would have done less damage.
Cut and Run RYAN
Nice


More honorable than most of you haters.  Of course that's all you have, no real substanance.  Pathetic, I'm sure your all waiting for your new gov. Freebie items.  Go gutless Colbert
Good riddance you piece of shit!
Invertebrate!
Talk about a lack luster end to a career..
We need this guy on the show
Treasonous Trump the RussianTraitor is guilty of:

Obstruction of Justice and Collusion, Obstruction of Justice and Collusion, Obstruction of Justice and Collusion, Obstruction of Justice and Collusion, Obstruction of Justice and Collusion, Obstruction of Justice and Collusion,
Thank God he's leaving...
Who gives a fuck I’m sure nothing memorable
#BIGLOSER
Glad Ryan is going, but @GOP is still coming for our Social Security and Medicare to fund their tax scam for the wealthy. 
Na na na na, hey hey hey GOODBYE!!
Get Em outta here
Rhino!
The Flimflam Man
FUCoff #paulryan & The Entire #REPUBLITEAPARTY FkN COWARDS GoTHELL
#DAMNFOOLS
Lol lol Courage #MyMessaegeToSpeakerRyan
Profiles in Cowardice?

That says it all. The #Courage of @SpeakerRyan. Maybe spending more time with his family will stiffen his spine.
You nailed it again @colbertlateshow!! 
I'm so glad that he's leaving office. And this video captures his lack of Courage perfectly.

Ryan got his tax break. Now he's cashing out.
Cat's In The Cradle https://youtu.be/7OqwKfgLaeA  via @YouTube
Ryan's legacy, tax cut for the rich, no health care and increased deficit by trillions, something really to be proud of.
Yep,  a gutless worm.

I’ve been cackling for over ten minutes
Paul the Rat Ryan is supported by the Evil NRA!
Guess this was made for @ananavarro
Bravo! Good riddance take McConnell and most of the other spineless pandering GOP who enabled a feckless POTUS to promote racism division reckless deficit expansion gun violence global humiliation...enjoy your retirement..don't let the door hit you in the ass on your way out
#rats  #ship, #etc ...

Too far. Unfollowing.
Say what you will about #PaulRyan and his #courage, but at least it appears that he can read the handwriting on the wall. #Vote2018
Wish I could retire at 48 and make my full salary with health care for the rest of my life.
I am so happy for #PaulRyan being able to retire at 48 and spend time with his family. He definitely made sure the rest of us won’t. #hero #goaway
Don't kid yourself hes running for President
I don't think so. I think even he sees the writing on the wall.

Your man crush on Trump is quite deep ..
Does his departure count towards White House bingo? #bluewave #bingo
If he was so brave he should have done something about it. Instead, he let it all happen.
Mr Ryan, Ayn Rand thanks you for your service. You made the wealthiest of Americans richer, motivated the unworthy classes with massive cuts to the safety net and put the privileged in charge. And No worries, deficits don’t matter.

So true!
#SpinelessWonder
#awful
He courageously kept the same haircut as that kid from the Munsters.
When it comes to speaking up and taking a courageous stance, Caitlyn Jenner has bigger balls than Paul Ryan.
This is what happens when you have no father figure after your kiwis get some fuzz on em.
You’re boring
Yep. He’s awful. Good riddance and work to get out the vote every where!
#FUCKPAULRYAN
So says Clit Colbert of liberal s#ithole television.
Perhaps his plan ended him


That is a little harsh
Hit the weights because politics didn’t workout. 
Talk about kicking a guy when he’s down. What’s he gonna do?  Open a used car dealership?!
@IronStache, for you. Enjoy.
Note he said his last year as Speaker of the House. Do you think maybe he's planning to run for president? I can't stop laughing
He might not have to run. He could "reluctantly" take the spot if Pence gets bounced along with Trump. Ugh- Trump, Pence, Ryan. Would one prefer death by shooting, stabbing or poisoning?
with mid terms coming up soon i doubt pence would be bounced with trump at the same time and likely would be in office when (if?)trump is removed or resigns.  someone else will be speaker of the house by time that all happens.
#FUCKYOU & GOOD RIDDANCE @SpeakerRyan! 

Using your KIDS as an excuse to run with your #GOPTaxScam #GOPCorruption  #NRABloodMoney money?

#FUCKYOU! America hates you! #LOSER! #SCAMMER #Traitor 
You will ROT IN HELL! 

#PaulRyansPartingGifts
I'll drink to that. Zero acts of courage! Cheers! I'm despondent... Not! 
@GingerLefty enjoy!
Love it
Agree. He will have served just long enough to get retirement, and now that he's lined his own pockets and verified that he will never be president, he's out the door.

Paul ANSWER UR FUCKING PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!
This isn't going to take long, he has none.
<3

That final 'courage' graphic needs a '?' tact onto it.
