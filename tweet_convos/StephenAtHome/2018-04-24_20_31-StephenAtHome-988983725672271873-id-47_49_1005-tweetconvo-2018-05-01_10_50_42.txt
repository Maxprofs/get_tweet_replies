Hank Azaria is cool en tabarnac. He’s a brilliant actor w a sick bod. That interview was too rough for me. I love him.
I forgive the few who takes what they see and turn it into ugliness. I love the many who can laugh with me and tell me that that stereotype is totally not me and that the truth is so much better. #LaughingWithApu #TheProblemWithApu @TheSimpsons
Just to clarify: I’m relating as a fellow minority lol 
Will you be declaring Bill Cosby's innocence tonight?
Nooooo!!!! Missed it. Doh! @TheSimpsons
Remember when comedians wanted people to come watch them for comedy? Now comedians are encouraging people to tune out.
How about the Australians who take our American roles in the films because they're able to look and speak like us Americans and that's just not right, they're taking our jobs! #IGetItButIDontGetItSorry #TheSimpsons #ThatWasABadJoke #PleaseDontBeMad #ThoughtsAndPrayers
Missed it like I always do.

      
Construction workers in Iran may have unearthed the mummified remains of the father of the country's last monarch.

So would that mean that his mummy and daddy are the same, near and dear?

 To which Caitlyn Jenner may say "Hold my beer".
Somehow it is illegal to mention ‘Stephen Colbert’ on Chinese version of Twitter. I can’t post a comment containing your name.
If you are offended by apu, then you are a straight-up idiot LOL. I just don't see the racism. do Indian people have accents like that.. Yes they do. soooo..  What's the problem?
Didn't you just do an offensive fake French accent during your monologue yet we are roasting Azaria for doing an Indian accent on a satirical comedy show where everyone is a stereotype including Homer? The offended by everything police are ruining the world!
Colbert is a fraud. Part of the #pedogate cult.
Go spend some time outside. Log off for a bit
Now your turn Mr Ching Chong Ding Dong.  Take your purity test.
A big thank you to President Macron for bringing a little dignity to the WH even if it was for just a short time. It’s a good job you had dandruff otherwise drumpf might have checked out your fly. Thanks again. Come back anytime you can stomach it.
Ask him why he won’t talk to the guy who did the documentary?
Awesome
As excited as I am. I can’t wait to watch @runjewels on @colbertlateshow tomorrow night!   
That was the worst interview ever! Hank Azaria is so amazing and all you did was hold him accountable for the Simpson writers! Nothing about his wife and family or life?! What a fail!!
Your assessment is racist. You should not be representing women, especially Internationally.
Has anyone looked at Big Bang Theory? Worst than a cartoon character... leave Apu alone.... it is a cartoon with morals....
You're missing the point. It's because of the characterization of Apu on The Simpsons that a problematic character like on the Big Bang Theory exists in the first place.
The cracks are showing, Stephen. You've done it. You've really done it. #TheGreatAwakening #AtlantisRising
I love Apu always have I never looked @ it being stereotypical!! Raj  from big bang theory makes jokes about being of Eastern Indian decent!! Too may butt hurt folks making a mountain out of a mole hill!! Im 46 been watching since the beginning!
Im 36 typo!!! Hahaha 
Brockmeyer. Great show.
Since you live behind guilded gates you don’t have to experience the porch pirates. #porchpirates
Fallon has Kevin James. Decisions decisions.
Colbert > Fallon. Every day
Agreed, every monologue is genius. I meant Kevin James.
@StephenAtHome Thank you for existing! I watch you every single night, and cannot wait for your monologue, even when I'm not in the best mood, it's always unpredictable laughter, the best.


More like 2 hours for me??
You are my therapy, Stephen Colbert.
Can't wait..  It's 11:34 pm 
  Almost midnight in a perfect World...  tty L @StephenAtHome




Damn. I love me some Brockmire, but I can't watch this crappy show.
Can’t wait to watch the show 
Better be.
does he apologize for apu ?
For what?  Sincere question.
he voiced a character in a way that's pretty inaccurate and perpetuates a negative stereotype about indian culture... and not to mention the fact that the show didn't handle the story very well...
Thanks for your response, I need to Google this one.  But when you say "he", do you mean Azaria or Cobert?
Azaria. Who was apologetic, said all the right things, and confirmed that the producers of The Simpsons hadn't even given him a heads-up, let alone consulted him, abt the show's response to the controversy. He expressed a willingness to step aside from Apu.
Janice do you have NO!! 
Idea that you are making 
It so soon you will not be allowed to speak.whats with the urge to police every one.
