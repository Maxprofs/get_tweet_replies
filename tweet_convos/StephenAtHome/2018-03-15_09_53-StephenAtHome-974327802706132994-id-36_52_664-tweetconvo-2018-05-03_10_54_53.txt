#tbt to the such fun times with @JonBatiste and Stay Human on the @StephenAtHome @colbertlateshow  
I honestly wondered where she's been. I get a grin when she plays her baritone. She almost needs a stool. Tis cool.
Female sax players FTW!!

@gracekellyPAZZ was the BEST member of @JonBatiste ‘s #StayHuman band. I loved going to the shows just for that band. (Sorry @StephenAtHome )
Such a fun band, what a group of guys :) if you are at home near a computer on Sunday check out my live stream with my band! http://bit.ly/GKFBLive318 
If anyone can add momentum to this fight it is you Stephen! Emma González is a living revolutionary hero, 17 JOAN OF ARC. You have the power brother and I'm calling on you to use this power here and now! Have Emma on the show,help free us from this NRA PRISON CAMP! THX
Stephen, don't forget to remind The Donald that TODAY is the day, centuries ago, when a soothsayer warned William Shakespeare's Macbeth, "beware the ides of March!"      Love your show!

We all need more Grace these days!
Me and several of your viewers need your expert opinion .. Who did you think lasted longer ? Betsey Devos with 60 minutes or Trump with Stormy Daniels ? That might be a good viewer poll !
