Good for you and Happy St. Patricks Day!  Now getting back to Emma Gonzalez.....
Aren't you comfortably numb in your whiskey bottle yet?
@SeanOGraTek
Happy St. Patrick’s day
That was awesome.
"Danny Atta Boy"?
Stephen, there better be a Late Night talk show episode of #OurCartoonPresident with you on it! If there isn't I give up!
AWESOME!
Awesome awesome awesome!  First time I heard Danny boy and cried from laughter!
That song normally makes me cry. This version however...
Love the foot work!
Good Morning,  One day or another, I'm gonna get ya'
I'm gonna get ya', get ya', get ya', get ya' ATTENTION on having EMMA GONZALEZ on your show.  Please give this some thought Stephen and help support this young lady and what she is trying to do!

Beautiful and stupid. Agreed.
And yet, very funny and beautifully presented!!!!!! 
All i remmeber from this you were having cold , phlegm and persistence  to sing and dance
Danny Boy was written by a man mourning his son who was killed in WW I. Now I’m going to go snort a pile of Lexapro and cry myself to sleep.

I fucking love this.  It made me cry when I thought the head was going say he's already there.    When it continued I was, well, you know.
Not to be confused with the parody porn Donny Boy .. Similar happy ending .. Different boy
Omg....that was amazing, and a little scary.
The song has a certain shabby eloquence to it ... or is it baroque simplicity?  You're both credits to Inis Ealga!
I never liked that song.....and this is a day when you can hear it almost everywhere.
This and the memo saved the day! Happy St. Patrick’s day!
Loved the bagpipes.  And the step dancing!
#HappyStPatricksDay to you, too, @StephenAtHome  & @KarlScully ! Needed this today...
Oh...my...
Wow! 

Awesome: lyrics and the voice! (BTW, I think the song IS supposed to be the mother, not the father.)
We're going to need some theological input from @JamesMartinSJ before this is over.
It’s almost as good as the Muppets’ version of Danny Boy!  Beaker really brings it...
Thank you! And Happy St. Patrick’s Day to you!
You should have bagpipes on your show more often.

Even  on mute it was a thing to behold.
Skit'em, sic'em
I love this
Happy st. Patty's Day!



You missed a Hannity tweet about his jealousy of Comey going on your show 
~Really? How about try a new rendition of 'Yo Mamma'?
Grandma's favorite song 
happy st. paddy’s day!
