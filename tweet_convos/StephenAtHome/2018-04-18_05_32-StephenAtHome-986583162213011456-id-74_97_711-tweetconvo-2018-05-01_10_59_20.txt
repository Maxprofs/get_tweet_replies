Not his ears...
You’re a little bitch.
You use to make me laugh because you were funny!! Now ,not so much!!!
Killing the deep state! The more you make fun of mr President the mpre he rises in polls
I hold with the person who said the pic looks like Rosie O'Donnell...
eWatched the whole video, didn't smile once you're a moron.  What happens to your show when Trump is cleared? Comey's statement didn't cost Hillary the election, Hillary cst herself the election with her name calling.   Keep it up.
@StephenAtHome Probably no danger in @jenspyra  being released for violating Colbert Show standards because he has none. @NU_SoC @main_dempster
WHEN will @StormyDaniels be on the late show, Stephen? We all wanna see that!! #UpTheStormy
For what??
Franz Ferdinand's sax player can wail, but he looks like Joe Pesci and Steve Bannon grudged out a love child.
i worked on intro for strangers w/ candy was a huge fan wtf ??

Hey windbag, @marklevinshow said you have Spock ears and America agrees!
Colbert Writer Under Fire for Mocking Barbara Bush "RIP Barbara Bush, the only woman who was 92 for 30 yrs." https://tinyurl.com/y99phfxo  They call us the party of hate but the only hate I see comes from the left. Alinsky rule #4 Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules.
@StephenAtHome for president!!

Great interview! Enjoyed watching two intelligent men interacting with each other.
Trump continues his assault on our institutions.  Now it’s the U.S. Postal Service.  Comrade Bone Spurs, our Russian about town, wants to gut this communications giant.
Just in from Stephanie......Trumps pearlies.

I thought colbert was a good replacement for lettermen.  I was wrong.  Way to political.  Give it a break.
Thank God for Colbert. He is absolutely needed.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @POTUS @StephenAtHome You were @Comey s C*ck Holster yesterday. 
Conspiracy! AT&T UVerse Customers UVerse is aware that there is an issue with the on-screen guide for tonight, Tuesday, 4/17, which is not displaying THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT. They are working to correct the issue so that it displays the CBS 58 news...
Assholes

Loved loved loved your show last night.......Thank you .....

No.
Ok
Will there be @johnkrasinski or Emily Blunt (or both) coming to your show for A Quiet Place? Am so looking forward to that but haven’t heard any of that

Watch MY tuesday monologue here!
Wanted tt watch the entire Comey interview. Only on all access :(.
It's Trump whom we're satisfying my friend. He likes to have his name float around on anything long or short, foreign or domestic, legal or illegal etc. You're guilty as well as me and director Comey, in keeping Trump the "hovering"he needs. Read my earlier tweets
Has he deleted it yet? I’ve heard about it but not seen it
Eh...

Don’t tell me what to do ...... I watched it already and as usual it was thoroughly entertaining
No, can't do it. Promised @RickBeeney that i'll wait till her gets home to watch it together. Couple that laughs together,, :)
awesome!   thank you for the comey interview and for making him smile.
