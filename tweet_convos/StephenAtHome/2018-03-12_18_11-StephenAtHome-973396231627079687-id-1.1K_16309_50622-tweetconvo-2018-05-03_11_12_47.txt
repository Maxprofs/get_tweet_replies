Oh shit nowadays... Tom Brady needs rehab LOL
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, what if Tom was allergic to strawberries?? His throat might have swelled up and it might have been very messy!
AWESOME!!!!! Hate that I missed this
Sorry, Mr. Colbert. Anyone who supports Trump is dirt to me.
Sorry, Sam. This is a #ColdTake 
He only left drips in the bottom of the glass
He cheated. Light beer?!? 
@dallythekid
Haha the  at everything he does
Stephen, please stop forcing your guests to do things they don’t want to do.  It comes off as super abrasive. No means no!

Finally a reason to watch the bigots show.
wo
Who Cares what Tom Drinks.?..lmao

Lost to a backup quarterback in super bowl 52 tho....
by this logic the patriots won 5 with a backup
Damn
An extremely rare sighting of a tweeter accepting a loss
I don’t even know what to say to that so I’ll take my L
a rational adult on sports twitter this is amazing. @smithsonian please print this shit for a museum.
Plot twist: I’m not an adult, I’m 16 years old

Wow
yuck! I despise Brady
@2high4life_
Hahahahahahah I just go chicken skin !!!!!!!
That was pretty damn impressive!
Stopped watching Colbert after he hosted this guy
He could probably drink one glass in the time Brady could drink five.
Maybe he’ll kiss his son five times. One for every super bowl win.
Two seconds isn’t an extended period of time. I think that, in your clear obsession with the matter, you’re exaggerating.
I did not know tom Brady even drank beer 
@txcmb
I just love Tom!  He is a real God fearing man!  Love's to take a challenge!
You may have been asked this, but how much beer was that ( or size of glass?
@clintyp18 surely you’ve seen this by now since it’s been all over everything but MySpace. Still tho, I knew Tom Brady could suck some  
@Shawn_Spradling
That s my Tom!
@shane_hosley
this man inhaled that beer and STILL had time to go back and nonchalantly finish off the rest knowing Colbert would say something. against an Irishman. GOAT

tell your 55 followers, or your one Lombardi. they might care
@reptscantollie you got destroyed
The Philadelphia Eagles beat Tom Brady + the Patriots in The Super Bowl after Brady fumbled the ball on strip sack by Brandon Graham.

Eagles   41
Patriots 33

#FlyEaglesFly
When a Eagles fan sees a post about football and hasn't brought up their SB win in the last 24 hours
So hilarious

The single greatest human being of all time.
GOAT
Donate to make a giant mural of an eagle terrorizing him
@Slackar @MrBrando3 @mhammer43 Brady () >>> Peyton
That's an accurate hot take
I would legit pay large sums of valid US currency (not Bitcoin) to go to a college house party in 2018 with Peyton and Tommy where they alternate playing the Frank the Tank role.
He's gonna kiss his son so hard
@shanecass79 @nubbyfoster4   

Nice like total
Hasta en eso es bueno el cabron, lo amo! 


Tom Brady just wins at everything
Automatic bid
@bourquie94
@spencerhuffman
How can anyone hate him... 
@antnobili @antdelli
He deepthrows on the field and he deepthroats off the field. That's a special talent!
@poynts impressive
@TomBrady, glad to see your roots showing as we all learned that chug in a Michigan University
He’s good at everything
this is a picture of 2 really bad cheats

My idol 
Bro TB12 smoked Colbert 
Brady swallows #confirmed
Awesome!
Eagles
@Aye_slimkatie15
Shizzzzz

A new respect for Tom Brady @LemyH @bows33 @anniehopkins10 @Pablo_DaPlug_

Don't recall @StephenAtHome being poned like this...ever ! @TomBrady12_EP
@BortlesFacts Bortles would crush Brady in a bud light shotgun contest
@JakeGesse
Not bad
fake beer
The goat may be better than me at football but there is no way that he is better than me at chugg....oh damn.
So loved this ... Tom Brady such a class act 
@Mgeer21 wasn’t expecting that shit from such a pussy

@wglax18
@pewterws6_jamie

U see him switch beers? He ain't drink no beer
@BehindCurve
Tommay! Stevay !
More TB12 on Colbert! Love!
I like Tom even more now. He demolished that beer!
@ClintBennett90 @KDTrey5 @PEngelkemier1

@YOUR_mITCH_MADE
Tommy Boy and Competitiveness. A better love story than Twilight!
Why did Colbert switch the glasses tho
He is a straight up nice guy but not a good judge of drinking buddies

I personally do NOT like all the recent drinking of alcohol @colbertlateshow Stephen is doing with guests. Alcoholism is a serious disease. Stop promoting it. PLEASE!
What a fraud Colbert is, nice apple juice you chugged @StephenAtHome
But he can’t eat strawberries?
@fnik_
@Katielk5 just making sure you seen the legend himself confirming his legendary status. Lol
I love him!
@xXkenny996Xx
Brady’s on Og 
He might have just body bagged @PatMcAfeeShow 
Like a BOSS!
@austin_marr96 He is the G.O.A.T at chugging beer too lol
Lmao I saw, lit!  Daiquiris! 
@Brnin33 @nate_daling  can chug
He might be faster than me
of course he can open his throat up....loser
@Sm3w think you got him beat? 
Easy 
I guess this means I'm gonna have to like Tom Brady again.
Okay cool. :]
But was the beer... deflated?
reaching dude
Welll
@per_wolfisberg
@tom__vandenburg  this might be the greatest video on the internet
I could beat him too
@ssman05 Brady has a little O’Tierney in him
Wow that might be even faster than Seamus
Tank. Brady style.
Wtf that was fast
Next time, maybe he could try a real pour #yardofbeer #mysisterchugsbetterthanbrady @megsv13 #chugsanduggs
@saulborboa hasta en eso es una verga 
Si que pedo
During the interview #Brady says “you can’t win em’ all”... #JoeDid!!!
.

Tom has slowed down from his
Days in Ann Arbor.. ..
.
I love Steve Colbert!!
Do you kiss your son on the lips with that mouth?!
Wow that was really fast.
@PcainPeter
@Jobo7030

Try doing a keg bong, wussy.
For many years, the signs at McDonald's boasted of "100 million served".

Meanwhile, at  the present-day Trump- Donald's Pennsylvania Avenue franchise, where the turnover is higher than Ronald McDonald's cholesterol count, the sign can read "Most of America Unnerved".
@Jhayes4mu
That’s awesome
Who cares
Is there anything he cant do well? No wonder he's so happy!!!!
Hopefully this isn't a DeAngelo Vickers moment and now he just falls off the wagon haha
Tom Brady is the coolest guy ever!!! THE REAL DEAL!!!!!
@RealDanteDalton @D_train51
He’d outchug anyone. That’s insane.
He prolly cheated
The perfect man doesn't exi....
Did he get a facelift?
How about congratulations to Nick Foles? Finally. Worst sore loser ever. #fucktombrady #sorelosers  @TomBradysEgo
this is my only reason i like him
Love it  the !
very cool!
@HDMH42
Colbert switched the glass, its water.  Tom doesn’t want alcohol on his breath when he makes out with his son
why is colbert chugging apple juice?
@BigOleBrando
That’s weak
Brady and Gronk could beat anyone in a race
@S_Kelsey77 @Cmonkey888 @Motha_Licka 
Is Tom Brady a robot from the future
Sends it
Bruv
Cry baby
He’s a cry baby
Epic chug by Brady. Tough to top that
@Jremmes333
@stoolpresidente the  vs @PatMcAfeeShow...who do you got?
Jesus H! @LayDShea
Colbert is more used to chugging estrogen and man sauce.

That’s my Michigan boy 
Is he a competitive guy? #goat
@mrsbrintle 
Brady let’s loose. Hilarious.
Why he switch cups tho 
Anyone ever think it was non alcoholic beer??? The color is different and the dude is insane about what he puts in his body.
Who cares?
@ColinCowherd @KristineLeahy Tom Brady's 1 and only off season beer.
How the fucccccc
What's the most special thing about Tom Brady? Should we admire him? What's you most exciting moment about Tom Brady
@renersharp @bowers97
@loweMikee
@Zwett @Milt_III @Mitch_J_Weiss is there anything this guy can’t do?
Beat Nick Foles #hatetosayit
Or Eli I guess
@djvancourt is there anything he isn’t good at?
This reminds me of @BrodyOConnell...right @corydickman?!
I know who I’ve got my money on if there was ever a showdown #ohiomanzone
GOAT
lol I'd whoop his ass, saw this yesterday
@Rocarva @dwright0660 not gonna lie that was quick. Probably apple juice tho
He trying to be more liked make him more down to earth. Nah bro that wasn’t beer it’s not in his diet book that cost 130 dollars
