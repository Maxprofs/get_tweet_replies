Nice to see other’s have the same sense of humor:
So, the President likes to give everyone he doesn’t like a derogatory nickname. Now we have a really good one for him.

“Spanky.”

Why did you change your mind on Trump Stephen. What an eye opener this is. Shill.

You (Stevie)and Trump (Donnie) should change your respective acts. BORING.Can’t wait to see the backs of both of you. Bring back Bill-the last president for whom I voted and he left the office with America out of debt.  Stevie and Donnie-you’re both jerks-sad
Using nicknames is one of the important ways we can learn how to tweet like Trump.  Can I get a retweet?

You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit.
Start a segment called 'Got Spanked.'  A viewer's great tweet response to The Presidents tweet.

Captain Spanky Pants!
Colbert interviews @realDonaldTrump:
I'll be glad when Trump is out of office so Stephen has something else to talk about 
I will end you. stephen
Johnny Carson was a Class Act.   Carson seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he "didn't want it to become a political forum" and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers

Hopefully he’ll get spanked really hard in 2020....or earlier if we’re lucky 
Probably Spanky is better than my name... President Pussygrab.
I still think my "Philanderin' Chief" should get some traction.
Nice

Like yours? DikFore.

Ladies and gentlemen,  the President of the United States of America, Mr. Spanky Dennison.
Call the President of the US and ask him to spank a Thanksgiving turkey through the phone when the time comes for that and judge if it is ready as an eating meat.
HOLD ON STORMY, I MEAN DAUGHTY, I MEAN STORMY....

Oh spanky.  I though you meant the other nickname.
Call with China.
I'll call him Micro POTUS, and he'll call me the better fighter after we face off in the Bellator cage! If he thinks he has the worst hair in fighting, he's got another thing coming. 45 is going down in 5!  #ComeAtMeBro #Bellator #BellatorLegends #CuckResurrection

And apparently Monty python is preparing a spoof on the White House; have a great name for it

         SPANKALOT

"spanky" is pretty good but I still prefer "my little brony" for a nickname for Drumpf, given his frenemy relationship with Vladimir Putin...
Is it corndog?
Pants down @POTUS
Haha, I love it!
We call him "Buffalo Butt".
You use to be a Democrat leaning left! But gop money and Russian treason changed all that.
Ugh got me,,, fuck  #tRump
That’s president Spanky.
#PresidentSpanky the best nickname, for sure. 

Ohhh teehee teehee...that is so funny.. Do you have a nickname for your ear..?
We know, thank you.
This spanky actually has more progressive policies.
Also, Trump played the rich douchebag in this movie.
Spanky has a new nickname?
Yes he does. That name is Quasicheeto. And Quasicheeto belongs in his NY Tower not the WH.
