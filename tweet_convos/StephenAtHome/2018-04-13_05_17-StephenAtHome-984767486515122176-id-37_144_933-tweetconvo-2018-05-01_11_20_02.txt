I think the Comey book should be released as a graphic novel!

The real leaks seem to be coming from Trump....Yes. Pun intended.

I have never doubted for a second that the pee tape exists. 

The guy is a cliched frat boy. I wouldn't be surprised if he took the secret service to TJ for spring break to pick up some Spanish Fly and take in a donkey show.
it's too late for America, the country is heading for a car crash. The only question now is, how big the wreck will be?

Goood morning. Do you make breakfast for your wife when you are home
Oh, my gosh. After watching this, I stumbled onto your interview with Dana Carvey. The clip of Tom Brokaw banking obituary announcements for Gerald Ford. Eaten by wolves. Literally crying with laughter! What a great ab workout to laugh that hard!
Thank you!

Are we to believe that our four-fathers fought for freedom and liberty, so that we become a "Fascist Nazi Regime!" I'm pretty sure it is"NOT!!!"
How about a comment  you hypocrite.
I love you, Stephen!

Stephen, please comment on the new Tolkien book. It's your duty as the official master of all LoTR fans.
I would subscribe to a print version of the show...
Hi Stephen! Another day, with more news on the way. How often are do you and your writers scramble to update your monologue since Chump’s been in office? Crazy times!
Colbert is irrelevant.
