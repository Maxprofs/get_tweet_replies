We’re urging @POTUS to rethink cuts to #Medicaid that would be an assault on veterans and their families. More here: https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1376628189089726 …
À LITTLE LATE ON ALL THREE OF YOU! You were shamed into it!
They should be free to see a Independent Doctor if the wait over 30 days at least ,
They should be able to see an independent physician regardless of wait.
Exactly ,
Right on!
Our VIETNAM disabled #Vets need to receive the same health benefits that POST9/11 receive. 2010 Caregiver Stipend Vietnam #Vets were denied
If we had universal health care we would not need special health care for vets, Medicaid, or Medicare!
I get what your saying but where can the US cut cost? We are currently spending more than bring in. Not saying we shouldn't support our Vets
I think I say at least once a week, "I love @SenFranken" 
Is there a reason they love Trump?Just wondering.
Start w/ budget cuts. Those are good.
Cutting Milatary would be nice since they get all the $ in the world & still cant seem to win a war.
Have you ever seen a war fought on our soil?
Wait, now the dems want to take care of the vets? Where were you the last 8 years?!?!?!
Look Al - it's your girl!
Keep hanging with #Warren and more Minnesotans will realize what a two-faced hypocrite you really are.  
Start representing the moderates
If healthcare for our veterans is an extreme position, then moderation has worn out its welcome.
Health Care for our Veterans is extremely important.  Progress made by @POTUS is great.
@SenFranken  don't mess this up by our pandering
No reply, I see. Would you rather a veteran go hungry than that s/he'd be helped by someone you disapprove of?
He's forgotten the vets. Unless way vets pay T with some money, he doesn't care. His greed talks!
An important issue, meanwhile; when are you going to impeach Trump?
No money in it for @realDonaldTrump and his cronies #fuckery
Can y'all introduce a bill that prohibits insurance funding towards erectile dysfunction medication for unmarried men? How'd that go over?
Insurance funding, or government subsidies? 

I think you have the two confused.
Either. Viagra is covered under government subsidies for certain conditions
That should also include those non citizen vets that served this grateful nation, and thanked them by deporting them...
That's not how it works..
2 clowns you need Pelosi & Maxine with you to get 1/2 a brain between the 4 of you
you haven't care in the past letting thousands of vets die waiting for care.Not going after the corrupt Va's.Shame on you
Urging?  Are you kidding me?  He campaigned on and is doing more than Dems have ever done. Hard to fix the system you ruined.
This isn't something you needed to urge him on, he spoke about this EXTENSIVELY. Don't pat yourselves on the back!
Y didn't u hypocrites ask for that when obama was President?
U suddenly found out about common decency?
Franken... you're a screw up but if you go do your event with Kathy Griffin, you're be MUD too!  Denounce and CANCEL. Not about your Book!
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi  WE are waiting to see if the DEMS put out a Presser TODAY condemning @kathygriffin  beheading of @POTUS  ???
Why didn't you do something years ago when it came out how bad the VA was instead of passing the buck now
And did he respond?
THAT WAY YOU GUYS CAN SAVE YOUR TIME/EFFORTS TRYING TO RIDICULE ANY TRUMP IDEA & INSTEAD PROVIDE EVERYONE WITH YOUR DEM MASTERPIECE 
For 8 years the Zerobama Admin ignored the vets.  Now that Trump has made it a priority, ol Frankens on the band wagon.  go figure
WOW!  ITS ABOUT TIME ALL OF YOU AGREE TO DO SOMETHING WITH A POSITIVE PURPOSE!!  WHY DONT THE DEMS OFFER SOME IDEAS?  
To have an idea, would take some gray matter.  Any more questions?
So Tell Me Why Dem Pres Barry didn't do this????
Funny how this wasn't a priority the last 8 years.
Yeah, cuz @BarackObama didn't do squat.  No one believed him when he claimed respect for our military personnel.
#Trump's plan is written on back of #TrumpTaxReturns & he's still under audit
But will you take stage next week with Kathy griffin if so you disgrace our veterans
You were awesome on @TheView  today.  Ted Cruz / fish in the microwave was hilarious.
lol cause Obama wouldnt do it!!!
.
Half the eligible voters don't have enough interest in America's politics to even vote.

How do we get them to be interested?

#FAIRism

#nothelpful At some point we have to change minds and try to unite. This plays into RU hands. We are one country. Recall Obama '04 conv spch

#FAIRism is the answer to hold TRUMP & CONGRESS ACCOUNTABLE,

How about help get him impeached!
@USMC @usairforce @USArmy @USNavy @USCG 

These brave men and women deserve to be taken care of for life as they take care of our country!
The cost of war is not just on the battle field, but in the lives it destroys on and off the field.
#SuicideAwareness #veterans #military
Good luck with that
Thank you.  This is the broken promise that hurts my heart the most.
http://www.HomefrontHugs.org/2016/09/28/vetsuicidesolutions/ …
If that happens all around and we can start offering buddy programs &therapy dogs in between appts we might reduce these horrendous suicides
Thank you so much !!
I just dont understand WHY they can't get care, whereEVER and whenEVER they need it. The suicide rate is horrid. 24/7 care has to happen.
@franifio how 'bout demand? After all, it was a promise.
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha.....MY PRESIDENT IS DOING MORE FOR OUR VETS THAN ANY OF YOU SCUMBAGS EVER THOUGHT OF ! GO GRANDSTAND ON TV MORON !
@SenFranken thanksfor your intentions,but dt listens only to dt. As a retired vet, he doesn't really care bc he doesn't understand!
how about  just getting the 5th columnist traitor and his traitorous administration out of the USA!
Yea like you actually give a flying monkeys A about us
Where were you 2009-16 as BO mismanaged the VA?
Help him with the courts. Court just ruled corrupt va administrator could not be fired.
The VA was corrupt under he last administration but weren't most things.
Please don't refer to him as POTUS and don't ask him to do anything. It only legitimizes what is illegitimate.
Lol,  not too bright, are ya?
While @tedcruz insistS the  man keep his promise to pull out of the Paris agreement! WTF
Could there be a chart & PowerPoint presentation with @POTUS quotes so to help him comprehend them? Perhaps send them certified mail? 
The VA healthcare system should be abolished.  It is gangrenous.  It cannot be salvaged. Veterans should be able to use any hospital.
so. much. winning.
@POTUS 
Get him to release his taxes while you are at it.  I have little hope he will do either. #resist
Al, please don't let this administration do ANYTHING. PLEASE devote all of your resources to getting tRump out of the WH NOW!
@realDonaldTrump is too incompetent to do anything. The real power lies across the aisle with #corruptGOP. They all need to be fired
You should urge him to walk off a ledge
