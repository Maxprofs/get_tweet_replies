"Will there be a hearing on the health care proposal?" Senator @clairecmc asked today in the Finance Cmte. You should watch: #Trumpcare 
And I agree with @clairecmc. Americans have no idea what's being proposed in health care bill behind closed doors. GOP, show us your plan.
They don't want us to kno! RESIST!  VOTE! 2018 take back OUR
CONGRESS!
Y'all don't forget Joe Ossoff in GA 6th district is in an election on June 20th!if he wins that gives us a new seat in Congress! Contribute!
Let's remind people that she doesn't support a liviable wage
As is your RIGHT & obligation @SenFeinstein @SenateDems - withhold consent & filibuster by amendments; lives are at stake! #ProtectOurCare
I'm not a fan of people who don't work getting better health care then people who work.workpeople pay the bill of those who dont
I challenge Congress to give up their taxpayer subsidized healthcare plan and buy one on the open market in their own state. Step up
This lady needs to show up so she can take part in the process.
I have disagreed with Rs (&Ds) before. Never ever thought I would live to see this level of deceit & corruption. What happened???

The Dems need to provide a strong alternative, not just complain about the GOP.

We all need to keep our eyes on ALL of the balls.  The Russia Investigation is a small part.  The rest of the damage is still in progress
.@GOP Congress 1)stop sabotaging Health Insurance Markets to drive up HC Premiums, 2)work to fix ACA & 3)throw #TrumpCare Death Panels out.
I think it's hilarious that you consider any aspect of #Obamacare "Progress".  Lorne Michaels was right... you are a funny guy.
Wow

WOW!
The GOP is out of control!!! This is so ridiculous!
Scumbags 
Get them Sen Franken!
and they are doing it behind closed doors.  GOP is embracing a different definition of democracy.  It's clandestine and will destroy the US.
So what are @SenateDems doing.
P.S....Look in This months AARP magazine . As Promised they published the full  list of Reps that through us Older Americans under the bus .

The Senator's statement was chilling
We must stop them! This health care plan they are looking to pass is despicable!
Wow preach it 
Progress?  Rofl.
You've made no progress!  Quit lying to the public!
You call skyrocketing premiums and not being able to see a decent doctor because they don't accept your "insurance" progress? 
Is there ANY Law, Rule or Regulation to force the @POTUS to undergo a Mental Exam ? I do believe it is a valid point, given His behavior.
is it me or are most #republican senators & representatives past their expiration date to serve in government.
This is what we need to be talking about @CNN  @maddow
This should be illegal!!! #WeWillRememberin2018 Thank you @SenFranken for keeping the @HouseGOP actions in the light of day. #VoteThemOut
You mean the same ACA that has not paid one dime towards anyone medical bills and only forces people to buy a product they can't afford?
Actually they're trying to roll back ev'ything Obama got to pass either through executive privilege orthe Supreme Court.
A Mexican who hates Trump you are so original. The elite political class relies on your ignorance. Good job!
Keep fighting! Back room deals are not acceptable!

Hatch seems lost in the jello line, behind McCain
How'd you like his pathetic reference to Flint? I haven't seen/read/heard anything he's done for them (or anyone else, for that matter.
Thank you! We are paying attention and are worried and I appreciate that you stand up for our health care!! 
"progress"
Obamacare has twice the approval ratings that your so called President does. Try again.
Earth to Al!  You do realize the healthcare that you speak of is collapsing. It was jammed through before reading it. Remember? #disaster
She was amazing!
What progress? We've totally regressed in healthcare. Time for a true free market!!
