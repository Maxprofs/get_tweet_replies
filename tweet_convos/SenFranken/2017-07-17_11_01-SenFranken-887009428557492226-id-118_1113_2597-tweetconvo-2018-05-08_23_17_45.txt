And That’s the Way It Was In 1972 Cronkite Warned of ‘New Ice Age’
But wait there is more! The were going to blame man for global cooling as well.

Yep - man made ice age coming, then man made global warming coming, now it's "climate change"
The "web of denial" is people with common sense looking at the real data. You're fear mongering, and its going to fail.
Who are the funders of climate alarmism? http://www.climateworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/design_to_win_final_8_31_07.pdf … Billionaires club devoted to renewables.
Smart oil people like T Boone Pickens have already bet on renewables.  Oil and coal workers are skilled and could work in other energy jobs
Considering the rate of job growth under renewables, I'm surprised that coal country hasn't undergone a renewable renaissance.
Pittsburgh went through a very painful transition. My Dad is from Pittsburgh. They are less dependent on coal and steel today
Good to hear it turned out alright. Hopefully future transitions in other regions can be less painful :/
Compare PA with WV. Shows importance of policy foresight by govt, academia, businesses, and citizens
It comes down to acceptance of the status quo, or daring to venture into new territory. The latter seems to beget more growth.
It comes down to the government destroying industries and ways of life to benefit others financially. That's it
As in big money corruption in politics?

Mark Jacobson, climate alarmist, has scientists questioning his work. Rather than debate science he hired a lawyer.

What was Obama's connection to Solyndra? Hint:Donation money

UPDATE "Perhaps the biggest story in #climate this year, the rebound of #Greenland snow and ice" https://climatism.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/97-of-climate-experts-promised-you-the-arctic-would-be-ice-free-by-2014/ … C/o @BigJoeBastardi
No one denies the climate changes. You have to change the NAME every 10 years because no one buys the scam.
Who are the major players getting rich pushing the climate change scam? Hint: They use private jets, yachts, multiple estates, & motorcades.
Want some credibility concerning climate change? Hint: Quit manipulating data and quit being hypocrites concerning fossil fuel use.
More likely to be new Turks seeking market. Crony capitalist scum from Big Renewables seeking to leech tax payer wealth. Your mates/donors.
Another 3 years before you can be voted out. Counting the days.
And look at the HUGE niche market for #fossil fuels!  Wind and Solar!!! https://youtu.be/TVJZdJZ6PwQ   Ppl are so gullible.
Could it be . . .  RUSSIA?
If Russia controls our elections this part matters little. People protest fracking because it's generally a bad idea. We don't frack in MD.
One of the major players in climate change fear mongering made his fortune at a fossil fuel empire. He's probably given you stacks of coal $
Couldn't be enviro leaders racketeering about the 'certainty' that skeptic #climate scientists are 'industry-paid shills', could it? #tcot
You are a carbon cycle denier! Necessary for life on this planet. Combustion only happens on this planet in our solar system for a reason
Perhaps you should brush up on that 1st Amendment thing, Mr. Franken.
The term "denial" is used by nonscientists who in their naivety think that they understand science
Who are the major players behind the web of denial on climate change? Hint: They have a huge fossil fuel empire. https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1435756513176893 …
Franken is also brainwashed with the "Fossil Fuel" myth.  Russians deep wells at 40,000 ft. debunk this false belief.
As if the people pushing the "climate change" agenda don't have green investments.  Come on, Al...another lie

Green = Socialist Slavery.
That is uninformed, hypothetical rubbish!  Stop dishing out unsubstantiated lies.  Who has funded the alarmism? HINT: Gov. has deep pockets.
You know that's not true. You're making it up. When did you decide to sell your soul? #climate
I don't deny climate change yet I'm totally against instituting totalitarianism as a result. But unlike politicians, I think rationally.
No empirical data on Global Warming.  Yes idiot things are always changing. I used to have an iceberg under my A$$ a million years ago #MAGA
If they hadn't gone all in on the alarmist bit. Taking care of our planet is always a good thing but when it hurts economies at zero gain?
Not necessarily. What they probably have is data, Sir. Data. I'm sure you know what that is.

Which is the major Party behind the Climate Alarmism? #DemocratsSuck #Socialists #badscience #algorewaswrong #suckitcockknockers #climatelie
Of course the climate is changing... I'm looking for someone to tell me what % of the change is caused by humans? #Science
al you need to tell david letterman to get on twitter about this koch issue
And tell him to expose the Democrats fleecing the system soaking up green energy subsidies too!
Hint: The climate change cult has a larger government grant empire.
You just proved that you know zero about the subject. So Sad.
A simple assessment from a simple mind. *slow clap*
This is BS. All the money is on one side.... Those pushing climate change. That's it
Ah. David Letterman, noted intellectual.
Hint no they don't. And hint it pales to the $30 Billion our government wastes on flawed studies that make failed predictions.
You cannot deny facts Al
Leaders have a stake in solar Lol
You can't name one funded "denier"! All the money is on the other side.
It was 27 degrees warmer in 1927.  Explain that.
1917
Real Science is behind it:#CO2ClimateChange is Falsified by its[100%]Prediction Fails.CO2=Source for all Food,Oxygen,Life via Photosynthesis
No, it's people who can think and see through this fraud.  CO2 harmful? Cmon, come up with a believable villain.
The money is all on the global warming scam side.  This hoax is making Al Gore a hypocritical billionaire for example.  Why lie?
I assume this is a poor attempt at humor.
After all, it is obviously baseless.
Just like the Communist loving left claiming to hate Russia.
Data, science, and common sense. Those are the major players.
And you didn't even #ention  or #consider #manmade or #not huh? #Science and #commonsense do #not #lie like #foxfakenews. #Deniers, geez.
I used to think you were a funny & talented man. I lost all respect for you. The global climate was warmer than today 5x in past 8000 yrs
Who are the major players behind the web of alarmism? Hint: the major governments of the world. Which have much bigger pockets than FF.
I'm special, good looking and dammit people like me.
Al you are a joke (not funny) and an embarrassment to the people of Minnesota and a stain on the senate,
Be quiet and go away.
Senator, don't you know how to do anything but lie? You make me ashamed to live in Minnesota sadly.
Hint: people who see the truth that we are not in danger.
Bugnuts also is presently lacking a huge fossil fuel empire, but is willing to learn on the job.
Give it up man, the 3 percent have been right for over 20 years.
Without climate change (global warming) your state would still be under 1000's of feet of ice.  CO2 had nothing to do with that.
At least you get something useful from oil. You get nothing but debt and poor people poorer from the Pollution Indulgences you sell.
Remember when you had to spend 3 times the amount in campaign funds to beat Stewart Mills? You are so screwed next year. MN is Republican.
Fossil fuel is killing over 50% of the ocean's corals worldwide.  Watch #ChasingCoral
Stop worrying abt fake climate chg & conduct an investigation on who gave the American hating muslim a gun & hired him as a police
The MAN 
Follow the oil. Enjoy!
Koch Bros...?
They lie hard for the 
Al my fellow Deadhead it's Trump and Pence, McConnell and Ryan. They don't care about the planet they just want to raid it for its spoils
New talking point?
Elon Musk Mr electric car better hire the best security
Love you AL!!!
Are you joking?
Please listen!! Dems rally cry must be, "Healthcare A Right"!!! This will cut into his supporters. No explanation needed.
That would be Koch Industries.
Not in denial about climate change in denial you & your friends can fix it. Y'all tried results=hottest yr ever.6th extinction.Lost Larsen C
Oh please.... And it is so tied to Russia and the Ukraine.. Don't get me started on Exxon
Fossil fuel is a ridiculously unscientific lie!!! Let go of your Cold War Propaganda Al!!!! The monster is loose!!! He killed the good Dr.
Sweat, toil and blood for oil profits! Hint: a money/wages system...
Fix the cops in your S5ate. They are killing people for no reason. This is more important This is real!
Follow the $$$$ works everywhere, the writing on the wall has been evident for decades
So obvious! Why not name names?
Also take a look at the Mercers... They have and are influencing things in this area greatly. Of course the Koch brothers who are heavy oil
Just a bunch of dinosaurs who should've gone extinct w/the rest of their kind.
Am reading your new book. Love it!
And as with everything else from them, those that pay the price don't reap rewards. https://earthquaketrack.com/p/united-states/oklahoma/recent …
Exxon seems to play all sides.
Does their last name begin with K?
It's a literal "power" grab. Uranium, oil. All greed, power and ego-based.
But what about their trucklers?
al this is great ...i work w/public and can certify that only 1 in 10 actucally know who koch are and what they are doing to ruin america
But the other 9 know the damage done by Clinton(s) & Obama.
They're also sticking it to us over the price of toilet paper...has skyrocketed the past few years...greedy bastids
We know, but their supporters can not conceive of an alternative.
The same who fund disinformation against 60% of America's carbon-free, clean energy. #nuclear
MN's Monticello and Prairie Island nuclear plants avoid 10M tn/yr of CO2, equivalent to taking 2M cars off the road. https://www.xcelenergy.com/energy_portfolio/electricity/nuclear …
Idiots All. #TheResistance
Exxon knew, big tobacco knew. Nixon knew, Reagan knew the war on drugs was a lie, Bush knew it wss an oil war


War of the fossils over oil and dollars
Everyone should watch this funny & educational video on climate change! I even learned what carbon pricing was!
It's a series - and needs more episodes!!
I'm running against Trent Franks in AZ8. Since elected his income has risen 340%-all oil $. Now he wants to sell fed AZ land for exploration
I hope you are successful. Sounds like he is profiting from being an elected official.
He just tried to pass bill to expose 'extreme' Islam leaders in US. 27 repubs voted with dems and it was shot down. He's alt right +
Great info.
Thanks for your kind words and support. I plan to represent ALL of my constituents. Collaboration, compromise & consensus.
It's like a drug dealer denying the existence of the heroin epidemic
Dinosaurs???
No they are rational people not fear mongers
The Koch brothers!? Not fear mongering!? Lol!!! Wow ok. Sure. They just push the narrative of how BAD AND HORRIBLE renewable energy is!!

i will be blaming susan sarandon.
Hmmm, That is a tough one Al.
