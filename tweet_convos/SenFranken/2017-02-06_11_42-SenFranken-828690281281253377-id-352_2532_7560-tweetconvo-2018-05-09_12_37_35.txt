please read out the bribes of your GOP colleagues.  Name names -
AL All your Donations from the Teachers Unions may have to be returned..Good to see a woman who will help Minorities
Apparently rich girls finish first, an idiot appoints an idiot and no one in his party has the balls to stop him sad day 4 kids

Puppets gotta do what the string master Teachers Unions beckon.
@POTUS @seanspicer

Did you vote for war crimes legislation against the last administraton? Ignoring it?

@TulsiGabbard
when was the last time you walked into a public school? Talked to the teachers? Listened to the community? Saw the reality
whoops that didn't work out so well for ya!
Al, time for Common Core, and State (i.e.Fed. Govt) mandated education indoctrination to end. 

Dept of Ed=Waste of resources

@SenFranken
YOU lost,  WE won. Build a bridge and get over it.
How much money are the teacher unions paying the Democrats there? I think I'll check that out.
we know Stewart.... how will LIEberals control the votes & thoughts of the next generation of voters if they are taught to think
You lost ...... Again.
Aaaaaand she's in there.  

Good job there Al, you shill.
You shouldn't even be there. 1100 inmates allowed to vote. You win by 300. Your seat is fraudulent. You decided o care, fake.
@Juniper_Rising win or lose your showing strength and backbone...Get job so far on the hearing!It's clear you stand w/the ppl
thank you for trying. She is the most unqualified candidate for this position ever. Thank you for trying. 
When they line up with Trump's policies, hope no longer springs eternal.
please accept the position Trump offered you: Ambassador to the Bermuda Triangle.
Why don't Dems want better schools for our kids?
.@SenFranken Thanks for fighting the good fight.
thanks for trying. So sorry we're being railroaded by Wall Street insiders.
your GOP colleagues continue to betray our Country! Thank you for fighting #TameTheTyranny2018 #PublicServantnotPOTUSServant
.@SenFranken because you want poor kids to stay on the public school plantation.
You lost.  DeVos confirmed.  How many votes did you win by in Minnesota?
we need more than hope sir
stay stupid vote with al.
Al u r now worthless in two careers, comedy and politics. Go home 2 daddy!!!
so happy #confirmed our kids deserve the best
good lord, go away now
thank you for your vote.
Thanks for your NO vote on DeVos. Shame on Republicans!
Haha, you lost just like normal .
Thank you for standing up for our kids!

. You people should get on with the vote, it shouldnt take this long to do this, you waste all of our time
YES!!!! Thank you, Senators!
Thank you!! Thank you #Democrats #NoonDeVos
.#WeThePeople know why #Democrats are voting #No. #TeachersUnion paying 4 your votes. Not folling anyone but yourselfs anymore.
@cajunsicily #StopPresidentBannon
Keep fighting for what's right for ALL our kids! #NoonDeVos
as a voter from Minnesota I don't want you playing these games, I will do everything I can to keep you from being re elected
why? 

because you'll be out of business when schools start performing
you go, Al!

This is the most frightening thing about this whole charade. Absolutely no senate check on Bannon and crew. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/828975579395477504 …
this is part of a COUP to dismantle America orchestrated by Putin, led by Trump, and abetted by Ryan. Truth
Thank You Senator Franken
..except your @GOP colleagues don't work for the people. Just their big donors. So, there's that.
@USAjobs2017 @nytimes DeVos reminds me of the separate but equal school lie I grew up in.  No to that rabbit hole.
Did your kids and all you D.C. ELITES SEND YOUR KIDS TO FAILING PUBLIC SCHOOLS?
we certainly wouldn't want families to be able to choose where kids go to school...
, you demoRATS only want to oppress children in failing schools instead of giving them a choice!  SHAMEFUL & DISGRACEFUL!
Have to keep the poor uneducated right? Explains how you became a Senator.
it's how they get votes. Keep them dumb. Dependent on gov programs
you've done an amazing job at standing up for our children by standing up for our public school systems. Thank you sir! #nodevos
How much money do the school Unions 'donate' to the Dems?
Because they are protecting the unions, and the money they give to your party, NOTHING MORE, idjit.
You have no idea what is being taught to our children in pyblic schools, do you?
Thank you Sen. Franken.  Run for President.
you are a JOKE! But not in a funny way!!!
hey Al, I taught in both public and private schools. There's no comparison. Devos is right. Education by states not fed.   gvmt.
FYI @SenFranken did HOMEWORK & BLAZED last night on Betsy DeVos - THREAD: https://twitter.com/HectorSolon/status/828793751422255106 … #StopDeVos cc @SenGaryPeters @SenStabenow

@JoyAnnReid @SenFranken @SenGaryPeters @SenStabenow Or, dilettantes!
¡Muchas gracias! This middle school Gay Straight Alliance is proud of you for making a real difference to our kids & our country
Will there be an all-nighter to block #sessions as well?
FRANKEN ITS TIME TO STOP FUNDING THE TEACHERS UNION AND START FUNDING SCHOOL CHOICE
fat chance Al. Your party has catered to teachers unions and ruined schools. Time for change.
YOUR so called Democrats are bought and paid for by the Teachers unions which refuses to fire bad teachers. Facts not hype.
thank you!
Thank you, Senator Franken for opposing DeVos in education leadership position. I am watching from Texas.
how much money did you take from the teachers unions since joining the senate? HACK
lmfao
my kind of education leader. Because the "educated" ones have done so well She knows how to get things done.
Too bad you dont have the votes, Al. Go back to comedy. Oh wait you were awful @ that too.
will they announce when & how much the unions are paying for them to DUMB DOWN 'OUR" CHILDREN?
VOTE NO. This is ultimate pay for play.. not qualified in any way for this job
This is going to be the best 8 years ever
, can please with your colleagues who are in the fence, the GOP who are the fence. Keep her hand off education!
You had 8 years to improve education, but our education system has gotten worse. We owe it to our kids to do better.
I know you're not really hoping that Al. No way GOP will vote her down.
@marcorubio @SenRubioPress  The school children of Florida deserve so much more than DeVos.  Please vote no for them! @cnn @nbc
please stand up to most powerful union in country, the teacher's union & do what's best 4 kids. Vote yes DeVoss. Don't be afraid
Franken and his gang care only for the teachers union,not the children
Heroes. Thank you for standing up for our children. We will remember those of you who fought.
Too bad you are so full of hate for POTUS that you won't do what is right for our children!
Gosh darnit, I think I like you! Give 'em hell Al!!
lmfao. I really think...you've clearly already demonstrated...why there should be a #NoOnDeVos
As a Republican, I am hoping for the same. She will be a disaster for our schools and our children!
thank you for taking the floor and telling it like it is! #DumpDevos
I hope not, but believe you are right! GOP bought by Devos.
— @TheConservative Greedy One Percent @GOP indentured politicians in State & Federal legislatures are treasonous prostitutes.

Teachers Union lackey. Children's lives will be ruined because of you. Very Progressive. Very political. So sad.
@DNC showing who they really are, #Intolerant #AntiAmerican #viloent #socialists burning down Americasn Values and History.
you're a joke....
Dems have made it abundantly clear they want poor kids to stay poor and be stuck in miserably failing schools with no hope
Dim, "Because if poor children have a quality education I may not be able to convince them of their victim-hood and Dim-ness."
u stole your election with voter fraud
@BetsyDeVos The voters saw the hearing! Thank you Senator Franken! We would like an experienced person in this position please:)
if one republican is afraid to step up get 10 !! that haven't been payed by Devos
maybe they explain why they voted for his other unqualified nominees?
wake up Sen. Vote yes for Devos
call 202.2253121 let your voice be known.
Dear GOP not everyone can afford private school like this woman & her ilk. Someone Man/Woman up & help!
THANK YOU, good Sir! We the people strongly oppose this unqualified, unfit candidate. We are w/ you to #holdthefloor #NoOnDevos
You Support War Criminals
http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/5oGhd …
I think Republicans will let it go to Pence to decide. We know what that means.
Better than the war crimes you ignore, because of party politics.
http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/BKL47 …
did y'all just vote HIDING FUNDS FROM SALES OF GAS OR OIL ON FEDERAL PROPERTIES?Disclosure of Pymnts by Resource Extract Issuers
than you for standing up for public schools. #holdthefloor #noDevos #NoonDeVos
it's about time you stood together and just said NO! He's CRAZY and so are MANY of the nominees!
Minnesota is blessed to have you! beautiful place! I'd love to live there again but I may as well be in Canada. Will u visit? 
.@SenFranken - thank you for holding the line! #noDevos
Thanks to u & ur esteemed fellow @SenateDems! Our children's futures are at stake! #holdthefloor #saynotodevos
Thank you for standing up for this country's kids and teachers!
@SuperStarCam1 
From your mouth to God's ears.
Thank you and the other @SenateDems for fighting for education and our children.  We are with you.
.@SenFranken @jimmyj48125 I called John Boozemen and his voicemail is full.  I doubt he'd listen anyway.
I cannot believe someone sending a tweet like this to a United States Senator. Surreal.
wish more had voted no on Tillerson. :(
That is the only way you stay in office, by keeping your constituents a bunch of stupid people coming out of the public schools.
THANK YOU, Senators!!!!! #NoonDeVos
Do you ever consider retirement? Think of all the fishing you could do.


How about nominating an actual educator to head education in America? #NoonDeVos
Tell Devos the gov't is ending funding by student and see how fast she dumps those kids in Michigan! They are just $ to her!
Except for Cruz, right?
B/c I don't want to have to tell my students that the price of plagiarism is that you get to be edu secretary! #NoonDeVos
. @SenFranken stand strong!  #NoonDeVos
Suddenly school choice sucks? Give me a break this no vote means the left is in bed w teachers unions
@LeslieMarshall Last time you said anything of import was in "Trading Places"
@SenatorTimScott attempted to share why he's voting for DeVos, but instead rambled and became nonsensical. The answer is $$$$$$.
@despdomestic GOP:
"Wait, how much were we paid off to ignore public schools?"

*checks*

"Nah, we good. Have fun with poverty!"
Thank you for working hard to do the right thing.
Thank you!
@nola24073693 We are praying that they are listening! We The People Are Watching! #NoBetsy
great job tonight compelling, good solid facts and most important kids that come from a disadvantage and the adverse effects
if  they want to keep their jobs, they had better join you on this.

thank you...
thank you!
This public school teacher and mom is very grateful!

THANK YOU from this #NBCT in Maine! #holdthefloor Thanks for being brave & voting with your heart! #NotoDeVos

@ActualEPAFacts 
@FDouglass2020 @tedcruz @JohnCornyn Please! Integrity. #NOonBetsyDeVos #NoOnSessions
Thank you for standing up and fighting for public education!
Anyone who received bribes/campaign contributions from DeVos needs to Recuse themselves.
@ActualEPAFacts Whip your fellow Democrats into a frenzy, Frank!  We need everyone front and center!  Love you!!
Thank you for your words tonight! You made excellent points - I hope @SenateGOP paid attention! #NoOnDeVos  #holdthefloor
do they ever pay attention.  They aren't in it for us.  They are in it for themselves and their cronies.
#hopespringseternal
my argument on #NoOnDeVos - are they Republicans or sheep? It's still legal to disagree with him when he's wrong!
thank you #NoonDeVos #holdthefloor
Thank you!!
Thank you! We have your back! #resist
thank you!
I truly just love you! You bring such humor in the midst of chaos! Thank you for your leadership & integrity!
I really hope some wisen up and do the same.
We do too. Thank you!
@LifeWithEvan pretty simple, cash deposits and party fear. When your party denies facts, why bother with reason.
thank you
Thank you so much for your support of what is best for our children. #truepatriot
Great speech tonight, and I'm not just saying that because you cited my home state in your speech.
