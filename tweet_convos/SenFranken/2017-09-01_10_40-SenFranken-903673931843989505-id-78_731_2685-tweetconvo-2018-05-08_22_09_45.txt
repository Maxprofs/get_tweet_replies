But @FCC is considering whether mobile broadband service at lower speeds could supplant, rather than supplement, fixed #broadband services.
.@FCC, a small business owner who wants to begin a new venture today would not be adequately supported by mobile only #broadband service.
If slower mobile broadband speeds are deemed sufficient, @FCC could conclude Americans' broadband needs are being met. That's not the case.
By redefining what it means to have access, @FCC could abandon further efforts to connect ppl living on tribal lands & in rural communities.
I'm urging @FCC @AjitPaiFCC, along with fellow @SenateDems, to allow time for Americans to make their voices heard. https://www.franken.senate.gov/files/documents/170901BroadbandLetter.pdf …
Live & run a business in the country. Biggest concern is lack of decent internet service (can't call it "broadband" because it ISN'T.)
And cell service is spotty at best.
That's great, but rural communities with shrinking opportunities need jobs. What can be done to bring new opportunities to rural areas?
Education !
Well, you need to have jobs to support a population that can support an education system.
Wow. I totally forgot you were in Trading places.
Oh, because that's a "right" too.....
Electric coops like @BRMEMC are in a great position to be part of the rollout.
Fixed wireless like http://sky-tekcommunications.com/  goes the last mile for people that don't have fiber access but do have line of sight to a tower.
Speeds are similar to @TMobile 4G around here. 6Mbps is enough for video chat, but not close to the 25Mbps considered broadband.
Satillite's intrinsic lag, price, and data caps make it unusable for modern communication.

I live in rural Vermont. No cell service. For spotty internet people pay too much if they don't want xfinity
Amen! How do we make this happen? Our customers at @integral deal with this issue all the time
Bet theyd rather have healthcare.  Just saying...
Should have the right to have both. The education of our next generation and health are equally important .
@AjitPaiFCC needs to be jailed until he admits to and tells who paid him off. #clearlybought #ajitpaiisacriminal @US_FDA @FCC are bought
I do remember something about high-speed internet in the Bill of Rights.  Remind me where that could be... free iPhones and MacBooks too!
#Franken2020
I think you meant health care
Good luck. @ATT won't come an extra 1/8mi to http://us.House  here since 40s. They don't care.
5G microwave exposure is definitely not the answer, Al!
FCC should not exist. Internet is real. We don't need our caveman TVs&radios regulated any longer.
Urban communities underserved also #Atlanta @ATT hi-speed internet not avail in zip 30310.   Check ur address in AT&T availabilty website.
I would like to have city water and sewer in my house. Can you help with that you fraud.

And every other aid that all others are getting
And food and clean water and shelter, but broadband is important too.
Go Al!  Thanks for stepping into the arena.  But comics are super tuff, right?
Access is not good enough!

Yes, PLEASE! none available out here in rural MN!
Proud to support you from 55707 sir! Broadband out here in the swamps would be a dream come true.
Why do "we" need to do that?
Thanks Al. Upstate New Yorkers would appreciate it very much.
You rock, Senator!
In the best sequel ever, Stuart saves America.
When are you going to issue your statement condemning Antifa and the Black Bloc?  Do you support them?
And clean water! We must address these changes in protecting our air & water. Now.
Please run for President in 2020, sir.
Agreed.   The age of encyclopedias is over.
This should be a right along with healthcare
Democrats should be challenging the media to cover "net neutrality" . If Trump can challenge the media -why can't Democrats ?
Another dumb idea from peanut gallery.
Thank you!! This is a true equity issue, especially for kids who don't have same tech/computer educational opp as the kids in urban areas.
...and healthcare. Broadband AND Healthcare. I get it, "...baby steps to the elevator." #goamerica #broadband
We have to be broas minded as to methods and specific technologies
If they're truly representing WY's citizen interests, here's a couple folks you could work with: @SenatorEnzi @SenJohnBarrasso

Yes I worry about children whose parents can't afford charter schools and sign up for online school programs
Thank you
THEN bring a bill making it legal for cities and counties to build & run their own wired/wireless networks to make #Access4ALL available.
Thank you!
Thank you! I have young children and more and more ed. tools going online it's creating a disadvantage. Mobile does not cut it at all.
Senator please help me to see how & why some gov thinks that restricting the internet is a good thing. What benefits? All I can see is bad!
@RoyBlunt 's current cause is outdated accessibility. Perhaps you could reach across the aisle to him.
WTG !!!  #broadband
As of right now, @SenFranken is my favorite senator, and the ONLY person in the government I actually like.

I was honored to speak with you @refee00!! Thank you and you are truly a courageous #Whistleblower. I hope our interview goes viral!! https://twitter.com/refee00/status/899469441230139392 …
your almost there... You just need to remove the word "Access" and simply state Reliable Care... &  In a single payer system. #SinglePayer
I’m in small upstate NY town — broadband upgrades seen as  crucial for business.
Net Neutrality also!
PLEASE run for POTUS in 2020 Mr Franken. I'll send you a fruit basket.
I think reliable affordable healthcare might be even more important.
The FCC needs to serve the public good for the long run not just the short term profit interests of publicly traded companies.
This thread is  Thank You @SenFranken for remembering the Indigenous in your many bills. Including the missing and endangered Indeg Women
Yes! Everyone should be able to see The Go Go's in their lifetime! (Broad Band; bad joke, I know..just couldn't resist)
The economic explosion from nationwide high speed internet access is 2 great to b ignored b/w building it & use of it $ will flow everywhere
Broadband should b high speed & free like roads/freeways or low cost like public utilities. Who doubts the economic gain from public roads?
you are a funny little man
Yup!

That translates to "let's make sure they have options other than Comcast!"
And clean water.
