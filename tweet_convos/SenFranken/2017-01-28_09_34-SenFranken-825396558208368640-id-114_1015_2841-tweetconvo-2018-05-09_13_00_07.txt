Thank you @SenFranken for your leadership. #AmericaWelcomes #NoBanNoWall
(1/2) @realDonaldTrump has made it a top priority to tear families apart. It's disgraceful, and it's not who we are as a nation.
@realDonaldTrump We are better than this. #NoBanNoWall
It's a *play* to distract from;
He removed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Dir/Nat'l Intel from the NSC to add Bannon.
Physical separation does not tear families apart. Still disgraceful.
Thank you, @SenFranken, for speaking out so eloquently.
getting tired of you out of touch politicians telling us who we are as a nation.
then do something to stopMr #Trump - call for a competency hearing
Please work with Congress to overturn this executive order. All eyes on us.
It shouldn't be possible to threaten our country, so why is it?
@JayGordonMDFAAP @realDonaldTrump  ANYONE who commits a crime is torn from families. Illegal is ILLEGAL!
Do something. Don't vote to confirm one more nominee. Obstruct everything. No cooperation. Anything less makes you complicit.
will ONE gop leader denounce it??
They are not leaders. They're politicians, aka not even close to being leaders. The GOP enabled this. Fire them.
Fight Back - Dems need solidarity- oppose everything until he overturns this ban. Force GOP to go nuclear to defend this
Very true. The current American leader ship are cowards. And they don't even know who or what scares them.
He is implementing Obamas Ban you imbecile.  Where was your outrage when it was drawn and signed back then?
#FakePresident
thank you Al for fighting the good fight!
The 1st amend. Will be ibolished under Trump. He is attacking a religion, the press, speach, even thoughts.
This requires drastic action on the part of Democrats. You should all already be assembled in Washington to meet and demand time on TV.
Does the constitution really say that we are whatever the President say we are?
Thank you for standing up to protect the values, rights and protections embodied in our Constitution, Sen. Al.
Thank you, Sen. Franken.
so stand up against him and get GOP'S to help stop him! The American people are scared and mad. We need you all to fight!
@JayGordonMDFAAP @realDonaldTrump  U can't just pick & choose which laws to enforce! Our safety comes first!
You tell your colleagues considering a 2018 or 2020 run that what they do the next few days will make us embrace or reject them.
they don't even have a way to get articles of impeachment to the floor for a vote
@FemDem2021 @realDonaldTrump #2018
. Thank you for fighting for America. I hope you can stop the tyrant.
Tnks and I stand w/ u against his ill advised nominees and ex. orders.  Let's hold him to a higher standard
The man's had 5 wives, he probably thinks he's doing these families a yuge favor.
You're doing a great job standing up to Trump and his Nazi cronies so far, @SenFranken, keep it up please!  Stop @realDonaldTrump
UNFIT FOR THE PRESIDENCY.
so when do impeachment hearings start? RISE UP!!
@Captain_Heck @realDonaldTrump nope.. small minded people are tearing themselves apart. What happened to "discourse"?
thanks Senator Franken for fighting on our behalf!
YEAH AL FRANKEN! Lead us, and crush this guy. We need your leadership! #resist
YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS. NOW IS THE TIME.
@yayayarndiva @realDonaldTrump breaking families up is not Christian

apparently it now is who we are. I am profoundly saddened.
Donald Trump is sending a message. Let it play out. Obama didn't have the cajones, instead equivocated.
@EllenMorris1222 @realDonaldTrump #IMPEACHNOW!
"I'm not good enough, I'm not smart enough, and doggone it, people hate me." #AmericaFirst
@MinnesotaDFL off track and out of order. You have hurt our safety in MN long enough. 

@parrish4mn 
@realDonaldTrump
@VP
@MinnesotaDFL a lot of spin and no substance Sen. Franken. You are off track and out of order. You have hurt our safety in MN
Apparently it is who we are now. The rest of the world recognizes it. I'm embarrassed & ashamed of my country.
what will you do? Nothing or actually take a stand, not symbolically . #TheResistance No More Talk! Action!
if he's vetting who can come into this country-each one of his nominees needs to be vetted accordingly
@scron @realDonaldTrump then impeachment is in order, before it's to late..
Get ready to primary the hell out of DNC corporatists all over the country.
sthu u idiot
current MIT students being turned away as they try to come back to school?  This is insanity.  #notmypresident
when you let illegals into this country we cease to be America. Your ideals are endangering your constituents
#resist BIGLY!!
PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP!
thank you Sen Franken. Please keep up your hard work, we appreciate it very much!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP  Silence is consent. This is not American. The world is watching.
@LGMB97 @realDonaldTrump 
134,000,000 humans now banned from entry.
This is nothing more than a act of a incompetent madman.
We want to see more than words on twitter sir we want to see actions taken against this racist nonsense
@coton_luver How can this be stopped? Where are the patriots? How could we have become fascist so quickly and what can we do?
Dear Sir But is the effect any different than what has been going on for the last 8 years? Separating Latinx families Precedence
@seterapia @realDonaldTrump
More fear mongering from the left. You need a new game plan Senator, this propagandas not working anymore.
A bill should be introduced restricting travel for Americans outside the borders of the USA. #trumpworld
Will you be introducing/co-sponsoring legislation to overturn the executive order?
No, but it's who he is as a self-centered, scared-of-his-own-shadow businessman.
notice #trumphotelcountries exempt from exec order
get to MSP and find out if anyone is detained
so what are u doing about it Al? I voted for u and expect u to be the voice we need!
please do everything you can to stop this and further action from GOP and Trump. Disgraceful
vote of no confidence? Pretty sure it's time!!!
@realDonaldTrump shame on you
Please do something!! 
.@SenFranken Al, will you team up with me on  #PeaceTheFinalFrontier? 250k followers worldwide, unique approach. http://facebook.com/PeaceTheFinalFrontier …
--I'm scared & pissed off!  We're helpers not hurters.
can't we find 4 non-democrat senators who still love our country to join forces?
.@SenFranken Agreed. So what are you doing as an elected official? Your constituents are losing hope.
@amyklobuchar glad Minnesota has one senator who doesn't feel the need to equivocate in the face of pure evil
@julieorth2 Good to hear that members of congress are now protesting in disgust over this nazi dictator measure against refugees
Thank you Senator Franken. Your constituents look forward to your strong and principled leadership in stopping damaging Trump policies!
Stop discussing confirmations until you are sure @POTUS finances and executive orders comply with the constitution
Louis, unfortunately, GOP hold the cards. B/c, the election. #consequences
@jerweber Tell us what is being done by our elected reps to stop this horror
What are some realistic things that can be done?! We need serious action against this.
senator, you and your colleagues should be busting down the doors @ the WH over this.
@Nikluk @realDonaldTrump.He doesn't know Constitution .His Voters are saying they're sorry they voted for him
ffs do something man! Is anyone in congress or senate going to stop any of this?
did the white christian attack on Newtown, CT?
maybe I'm crazy but seems like Trump's group is at war with U.S. federal gov't.  Bannon's past statements are dangerous.
Apparently now we are! Republicans celebrating?
I respect you more than anyone in the government, senator. You are someone not afraid.
stop  pulling that my children shit make sure your a citizen and you won't have to deal with this Liberals have allowed this
Thank you Senator.  This is not what America is about.
@jerweber @realDonaldTrump Apparently it's not who we WERE as a nation.
Then do something rally up the troops and impeach this lunatic before all out War begins. Lives are lost and our Country destroyed
Time for another march. All colors, religions and genders. Show the world this is not what America values are.
well it's who we are in Trumps nation, hope the people that voted for this trash are happy
stop saying it's not who we are it is we are here no turning back
can you please light them up? This is too far
what is the legislative plan?
sadly we elected this government - maybe this is who we are. Effed up.
Only if we accept what is happening. Which we won't.
I hope not!!
It's disgraceful, but it is who we are. We're the ones doing it. You'll vote to confirm supporters of it.
