You might want to start by keeping Islamic Radicals out of the country.
Try truth for once rather than the RW lies you seem to swallow so willingly from NRA-purchased politicians  @SenFranken
Remind me: what did I say that wasn't truthful? You think Orlando shooter wasn't an Islamist?
He was a US citizen born here. Our gun laws allowed him to buy guns. Whose at fault here?
The FBI had several complaints about him & failed to stop him. But you think the answer is disarming all citizens, right?
The answer is clearly to stop the sale of semi-automatic weapons and/or high capacity rounds. "Citizens" don't need them.
Just muskets, right? Lets do all we can to identify terrorists/mentally ill, &leave law-abiding citizens &their #2A rights alone
Convoluted use of 2nd A. You know that. But, why is NRA so keen on stopping all studies of gun violence? Paid Congress 4 that
@Llamamama85 Thank you. Without a majority in the house & senate we can't win this battle. We all need to work to change that
@MLCzone You're kidding. Another epic fail by the Senate? #EndGunViolence
Our tax dollars are wasted. We're electing and over-paying stupid, selfish people.
.@SenFranken 
Dems need to V.O.T.E.
Plenty of Dems. 
Need to bestir ourselves.
 Ppl's lives depend on it.
And we love you for that.
Thank you!! Moms w/ @MomsDemand VOTE and we will #RememberInNovember. Much love! @Everytown #DisarmHate

@SenFranken
Start with yourself and liberals denial of dangers to unprotected citizens as they flood country with more danger to them
We'll just have to send you some helpful votes in November.
Thank you, let's all#RememberinNovember
@Africanfighter This was a hate crime plain and simple. He just wanted to use it to promote ISIS. He wasn't "with" them.
#DisarmIslam #BanTerroristImmigrants

Thank you, Senator Franken.
@Rebecca_221B Thx for your efforts, Senator. For your selfish colleagues, We will #RememberInNovember
@brielarson So pathetic that changes to gun laws not accepted. Do we have to wait for another tragedy to take place?
your Tweet was quoted in an article by @mashable
Replace "disarm hate" with "trample due process"

You sucked balls on SNL by the way.
thank you for your tireless service.
#DisarmHate by #ArmingLove. love of #freedom. love of the #Constitution, all of it! #2AisHomelandSecurity @nrawomen
@Womenspeakup 
We know you will !
thank you thank you thank you. Yes yes yes. #DisarmHate2016 #RememberInNovember Keep on keeping on!
@JuddApatow @BenSasse What have you done "Senator". I guess we should ask the NRA where your backbone is.
#DisarmHate #WillRememberInNovember
thanks
@CloudKatt disarm suspected terrorists
Thank you for your leadership.  Stop these fools.
Really?  And all this time I thought you didn't want to stand up to islam.
@clgoddard #RememberInNovember
Thank you for your efforts!
@lor_knibbs the fbi questions the guy three times. He buys a gun in a shop w/ bg chk and response is more bg chks needed? Unreal
I thought his father bought the guns.
dunno. If so, proves the ignorant ass folly of the bg check.
@GravityisRising 
Everything? Starting now? I guess better late then never.
Maybe we need to stop calling them mass shootings & start calling them post-birth fetus massacres?
am at an #Orlando vigil right now. Thank you
@JuddApatow What about #disarmcrazy?
I think we should promote a fundraiser to pay these low-life senators for their vote against the NRA. Could that shame them?
@JuddApatow then give up your security detail Sen. "Satirist/Frankenfraud"
@JuddApatow Does that include sidestepping due process?  You have lost your way, Senator.  So disappointed in you.
please keep fighting! #DisarmHate
@girlsreallyrule The vote was strictly party line. Shame
@JuddApatow thank you senator.
which is harder comedy or politics ? Unbelievable
Any way we can #DisarmTheNRA?
Love that you and @amyklobuchar rep MN. Time to start funding campaigns in other states to get you some decent colleagues. #vote
Stop hate speech in religion. Make it an inciting violence law.
@kingwood1455 You should support the best candidate for President @BernieSanders/ he has the common sense to do what is right.
time for another filabuster???  I would like to see a list of all who voted against. Douche bags
I will continuously post the names of the Senators that voted against these bills. Those Senators should not be reelected
.@SenFranken TY! So glad to have you on our side. #DisarmHate #RememberInNovember
Thank you very much!
