Thank you Al!  I'm in California but, I still care about Minnesotans.
Keep fighting Senator
Al Franken is running for president already.  The race identity people will not like this.  But, he is not good looking enough to win.
The saddest blow to average Americans yesterday was McCain's Yes. He denies others the healthcare he is now enjoying. His speech was hollow.
Trumpcare is literally NO-CARE insurance!
But you were more than willing to hurt Minnesotans in 2009.
Minnesota by importing already hurt themselves.
Tell them, Al!
Yes, you finally figured it out - you work for us, not your party
If you Dems and Reps cannot find a common enemy in @realdonaldtrump, we really are doomed.
Thy can start at th garbage he sends out on Twitter & th insults & hate against his opponents he spits at his everlasting rallies. #Resist
Especially when they're not CURRENT opponents!
That's the point! He keeps ranting about BO & HRC; it's over, done, he won! He just wants to spit hate. 
#TheResistance 
Wow like that is news. Obstructionist
Now you want to come to the table? Should have thought of that sooner instead of RESISTING http://everything.You  have no credibility.
Inspiring speech by @SenJohnMcCain - I sincerely hope our legislators will take it to  & work together for a beneficial solution.
I have so much respect for you!  God Bless you and your family.  The Tone and adership of the Trump Administration is so Destructive
That was Leadership!
"Do not eat the brown acid."
I love this man!
The good guys. Thank you.
Senator Franken thank you for thinking about your fellow Minnesotans. I was born and raised in Minnesota I wish Heller would do the same.
Thank you!!!
Get em Al!!!
#ADAPTandRESIST #KillTheBillDontKillUs
How can we work together?  Dems want health care for all.  GOP wants tax breaks for donors paid for by Medicaid slaughter.  Common ground??
I'm counting on you Senator Al
Thank you, Mr. Franken I have stage 4 cancer and Obamacare is what keeps me alive, my one medicine is 13,000 a month.
Give them hell! TX is supporting you! #TX8Constituent #GerrymanderedToDeath #NoHealthCareRepeal
Thanks you for being our champion!
Please fight for all Americans!
YES YES YES   FINALLY    THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH
Agreed!!!
Sen franken America has your back 100%
Call or Send letters to your GOP Senator(s)? "What's Trumpcare"? "VOTE NO, UNTIL YOU KNOW"! Don't take Health Insurance from most Americans!
Proud to see you and @SenatorBaldwin standing up for the children of MN, WI, and the USA #KeepKidsCovered
All Americans should....those who oppose....let them die!
My wife suggested that government appointees CANNOT be fired until a replacement is selected.  We have monumental vacancies.
Who is actually crafting a workable health care bill? We the people would like to see the progress?
Thank you!!!!
But yet you voted against bring the bill to the floor where you have an actual say? Do you not know how the system works?
The people are with you!
Haha! Oh now you want to come to the table? You are a comedian...smh
THANK YOU!!!! WE are here with you LOUD AND STRONG! #NoRepeal
God bless you, Senator.
To all w/ full-time jobs&adult kids under 26 who think ACA Repeal doesn't apply. Your kids will LOSE THEIR HEALTHCARE on ur policy #saveACA
Please have @SenSchumer read Chapter 1 (Why I'm a Democrat) of your new book. It could be sub-titled An Idiot's Guide to "A Better Deal".
Wow look at who your surrounded by....far left politics does not work for all Americans
Your fine congressional healthcare should cover a ripped out nail but I don't know what your dental plan is like. Good luck.
Why didn't @senatedems invite @senate republicans to the table when crafting obama care? Huh? Maybe not be in situation we're in now
Kudos to you!!
It was time 6 months ago you nitwit!
These people in the picture will do the right thing !!!

All so that the most wealthy citizens get their tax break, for shame GOP! You and your pseudo Christians will share space in hell... 
THANK YOU SEN. FRANKEN at least someone is honest, and that THESE PEOPLE WILL DO THE RIGHT THING!!!
Great
Thank you Mr. Franken for doing your job. I'm MD-D, pls fix the existing $$$ plan,so we can afford college&retirement
How about working with them to pass a bill that helps all Americans?
Go back to Comedy you are you are even funny looking
Time for you to resign you don't know what a better Healthcare is
SINGLE PAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Senator Al Frank it is time to come together Minnesota family and friend thank you I know you're working hard everyday
It's time to suggest risk corridors be paid to fix the #ACA!
http://tinyurl.com/m373yqh 
GOP don't want us to have gov't heath care!
I may not be from there,,BUT thank you Sir....Keep Fighting
The Hero is now a Zero .
Just stop the antiChrist NOW!
My response 2UR #Facebook post about #HealthCareVote 2day Would  2get an answer from u, @alfranken #HealthcareBill #SinglePayer #Democrats
Thanks Al. Big fan. Please do more to allow people w chronic pain to access opioid medications via their pain doc, I was surprised u oppose
My response 2UR #Facebook post about #HealthCareVote 2day Would  2get an answer from u, @alfranken #HealthcareBill #SinglePayer #Democrats
They're coming to the table- with knives. They're not interested in working together. I'm not sure why you don't get that.
Pleassssseee, come up with a plan to fiiiiiiiix it..nt replace fix it..pleease. Tx
sorry you lost  !   but keep fighting
Can you bring the megaphone to the floor?
Nice of you to say, but really the GOP is in control and nothing is stopping the hate. It's like Germany.
Thank you, from a MN constituent.

Please don't allow FAKE #POTUS Trump and his cronies to pass the bill It will take away coverage from so many.
I'm not sure it will work but def worth a try. Tax cut: off the table. Money for women &children healthcare for all. Expand Medicare. Do it.
They will never work w you, Al. Their constituents hate you and would rather see the perish than see it prosper with liberals
Your my hero in Washington thank for your hard work I'm the mom of an autistic son with epilepsy it will ruin us you have my vote run
Represent Minnesota Al! Fight the good n right fight!
Thank you Senator Franken- keep fighting for MN and access to affordable, high quality health care.
yes - #bipartisan hearings, non-partisan #experts - work to improve people's lives!  #Thank you (#healthcare for #Americans not party line!)
I wish you were my senator in TN, Mr. Franken.
Don't listen to his lies!!! @StarTribune @ABetterMN @MPRnews @MinnPost @PioneerPress @FoxNews @MPRpolitics @greggutfeld @Bikers4America
Not jus Minnesota the entire country!
You going to need a bigger megaphone.
Like the Dems worked with the GOP on ACA?
Honstly,just got on twitter.cuz Al Franken wanted me to stand up! And John McCain needs healthcare. Bipartisans can end mistake. Only way!
yes i am with you
#StandUp #SPEAKUP #LOUDVOICESNEEDED #HEALTHCARE4ALL So much money in the United States, the Wealthiest can pay MORE nit less.
Executives (Esp.Pharmaceutical) with RIDICULOUS bonus Amnt$, must  pay a Healthcare Tax -INSTEAD OF A TAX BREAKS! Donate orsupply a hospital
"Single Payer" please.
What will be the trigger that will get you to support massive civil disobedience akin to Civil Right era against Trump and the GOP agenda?

Thank you Al!
Oh NOW its time to work together - why disnt you suggest this when the ACA was obviously failing after four years??
Of course you know they did and were ignored. BTW after living uninsurable for 7 years, ACA arguably saved my life w/ emergency CABG surgery
So it worked for me and to a > or < degree, millions of others fellow Americans.
Minnesota? Fight for America!
Thank you from this mom of an adult disabled daughter. Without Medicaid we would be lost trying to help her.
You go, Al! Fight. #Resist this obnoxious immorality.
Thanks, Senator!
Thank you!!!
Here are some in case you need more!
You should have been working on something different 8 years ago, I an disappointed as a Minnesotan. 2018 is coming
Thank you!
You go, Al!
Pres Kamala Harris, VP Frankenstein?
Franken - damn autocorrect!
Not just Minnesotas but all Americans. We support u from NC.
Go!! Senator Frankin
Thank you.
Letting millions "choose" to lack insurance and go bankrupt spreads disease and harms the economy. Appeal to ACA opponents' self-interest.
Senator Franken thank you for your work
I want a single payer, medicare-for-all system. If you push for health insurance that profits companies, at my expense, then you are a fraud
Let's get this done, but a plan that works; not a plan big money gave to Trump to shove down our throats.
You're still my senator - even though you're no longer a New York.  You have many fans here.
Go Get Em!
The Republicans won't work with anyone. If they don't get what they want, they'll pick up their stakes and leave.
Thank you! Stop this horrible process. #Resist #ImpeachAndReplace #Shame #SaveACA
Please consider 2020!!
Thanks Mr. Franken!
Yes Al go go go
Thank you, Senator Franken!
Are you opposed to open debate on the Senate floor?  Guess your more worried about party support for your re-election campaign.
If it hurts Minnesotans, it hurts all Americans.  You go, Senator.
Thanks Al
Hear hear
Please keep fighting against Trump care of any kind
Thank you.
"Work Together"
Thanks, Al Franken.
Thank you!
Give em hell Al
Work together? Our healthcare system is based off a failed employer based model. We need #SinglePayer NOW.
I support you man, but it was time to do that 30 fuckin years ago. This is a disgrace.
uh dude its time to pick up the fucking table and see if you can hit the republicans so hard they go back through time, then everyone wins
#RepealCongressHealthCare #RepealCongressHealthCare 
#RepealCongressHealthCare #RepealCongressHealthCare
#RepealCongressHealthCare #WeTheUSA
sure you will and you didn't come to the table with obama care
You have 0 interest in "working together." #RadicalizedDemocrat interests don't extend past politics & power.

And shooting Republican Reps
You have like two teeth left - good luck & good night!'
Introduce "The Mikey Amendment" -mandating  Senate, House, Cabinet & POTUS enroll in any healthcare plan they pass- see how they like it
THANK YOU!
I wish we had someone in Arizona fighting for us.
Introduce new bill eliminating party lock outs. #McCainBill
Godspeed to you, Senator Franken.
Great that you and Amy rep mn. Thanks. What sen/states shld we be calling. Flipable?
Thank you for your leadership Sen Franken!
OMG! I sure you all do your job and stop this hideous GOP.
Thank you
First STOP the GOP from passing ACA repeal and Trumpcare. THEN work together.#VoteBlue #WeFightForYou
We need more members of house and senate like Al!!!
Thank you
Thank you
I suggest publishing a directory of all the businesses the @GOP has financial involvement with. A #Boycott would wake them up. #SaveTheUS
Can never take Stuart Smally seriously. 
Bring a great plan to the table, complete with @USCBO score, @SenFranken.
Poor baby. How much you money you personally losing in some back door deal that trump is closing?
@bulldoghill ...that #MedicareforEverybody is what a #BetterDeal for everyone looks like, not #Trumpscare the ins. for no body.
Can we just take ACA.  Rename it TrumpCare.  We get what we need. He gets adulation.  Trump won't read it -he won't know
Have 'table talk', but American voters & taxpaying citizens will only take so much disrespect & abuse. This is going to get much uglier soon
@bulldoghill Thank you for all, Al. 
Can we start by calling it #healthInsurance  th@GOP wants to take it from #thePeople ...
I hope so.
love the work you're doing!!  Pls keep it going!  Speak truth to power!  You ARE a giant in my opinion!
Obamacare hurts many people from MN.  Do you not care about them?
Thank you Senator. We're counting on you.
What a joke glad to see you go back to comedy.    You have had 6 months to work together but obstruction is NOT WORKING TOGETHER
Thank you Senator!
@DNCwe need more than one moment with a bullhorn.we need a plan of action, to fight lies with the truth.
Proud of you
If GOP will only allow you to the table.
@DNC I wish u will mobilize the dems to fight 24/7 or we will lose fight like them or we will lose.
THANKS AL for all you do Nev wants to keep ACA repair Obama cares not replace it with wealth care. Saved my life
. @JohnCornyn @tedcruz  Can you all work with the Dems to do what's best for Americans?
GO BABY GO! Do it for FRAN,FOR US,F OR U.S.A.
Senator Franken please run for POTUS 2020!  The Dems need a strong voice & a clear message - not just any bandwagon that passes by!
AlFrankin 2020
What happened to Ron Johnson? Was going to vote no and changed his mind. What pressure did Trump place on him?
@SenateGOP  Do you hear what Al said? Get to work- collaboratively!
Look at this Smuck, a Failed Comedian and now a Joke!
Thank you @SenFranken Please keep fighting for us
Work together to do what? Pass #MedicareForAll? Because anything less would be uncivilized (and status quo)!
Thank you, Al. Glad to call you my senator
Shame on you you should have done something along time ago
Be specific @SenFranken. What does "fight tooth & nail" look like? Polite parliamentary procedures? Strongly-worded letters? Hand-wringing?
People are going to DIE if the GOP gets its way. Standing on the steps of the Capital & shouting through a megaphone accomplishes NOTHING!
That'll be the end of the RNC as we know it.
We need a universal health care single payer movement. Organize the working poor. Vote out the reactionaries.
