I love your shirt sir. The hat is nice too. Wear it Proudly. Thank you!
you shouldn't have backed Clinton. #demexit
nah,why ya playin?Bernie was Stein spoiler; ,dnc primary aka bought ticket&corrupt;done;stayin in box on you
Those elderly folks that supported Trump are in for a very rude awakening, As the saying goes, "They know not what they did."
it is great to hear all the leaders pontificating, but what is the Democratic vision for preventing the rollback of everything
The usual...crickets.
lol, yes, but no surprise
please keep doing the heavy-lifting regarding doing what is right &just for working people &consider running for Pres in future
maybe we could shave a couple billion off the alimony we pay Israel and the care of our own first?
@ZaRdOz420WPN We would'nt be in this spot if you & the other super delegates hadn't voted against your constituents #DemFail
this statement is weak He should say> I will Filibuster any attempt to get rid of Medicare&Medicaid
No argument from me on that. @SenFranken
that statement really annoyed me. Im afraid the dems will cave in. The last days of our Democratic-Republic are here.
Dems will do wht they always do, CAVE. Ppl need to stop voting 4 these parasites who don't give a abt us!
I mean, you're RIGHT, but that was 5 days ago & I want some quiet. Everyone does not want interjections all the time.
please don't forget protecting Social Security, 2. Otherwise have to screen scene of you on train from Trading Places in Senate!
TY @SenFranken
Republicans seem to have no care nor understanding that Medicare/Medicaid cuts will kill people.
GOP know this, but like Dems, they are bought by big money & don't work for us, the people anymore.
easy for you to say...you can afford your gov't insurance...us paupers who work harder than you cannot.
If U TRULY cared U would've backed @SenSanders since he promised Universal Healthcare 4 all but ya went with the MONEY instead
we need more Senators like Al who remember where they come from.
@ColleenHolt20
thank you Sen Franken for your common sense!
Do all you can for us, please. Old folk & poor are going to suffer under Trump/Ryan. And many voted for Trump. Don't understand
Keep up the fight! If GOP can obstruct for the wrong reasons we expect you and other Dems to obstruct for all the right ones!
The GOP thrives in the suffering of others, that is the fundamentals of their party establishement.
And social security, too. Right @SenFranken? @NanaDavis_46
Thank you so much! @j_ro3
you were much too kind in your trump likeness. He needs a few more chins
It's called a #GOITER !!
then please commit to fixing it, not just defending it... there's little point in preserving that which is unsustainable.
that's an untruth politicians + Corp America want u to buy
Thank you Sen. Franken, my family is counting on you!
Thank you! Take note @realDonaldTrump
how about doing something about Donald trump? He is not legitimate.
thank you!!!
THANK YOU, SENATOR!!
Thank you Senator we need your help. We in IA get no help from @ChuckGrassley @joniernst in many matters.
@edunwody #Filibuster @CoryBooker @SenatorMenendez
@Headerop1 The ACA actually reduced Medicare program costs; Ryan's plan will increase costs 4 60% of participants. Not good!!
Al I agree. Personally I think we should all enjoy the healthcare benefits that the speaker has.
Join the #Resistance and boycott the Inauguration Senator.
thanks Al. You're a prince among men.
Feel better knowing you are there looking out for us. Potus run 2020 maybe?

thank you Al! #savemymedicare #savemysocialsecurity #fightforus
Thank you so much!!!
Please also fight to keep retirement age as is.
.
This is Your CALL TO ACTION the big Question is; HOW WILL U ANSWER?
Endangering not just us & Our Nation, but our Friends & Allies. ask them HOW THEY COULD ALLOW HATRED 2 WIN? So I would say that
At night knowing that they Voted in Racist, Bigoted, Sexist, Religious, White Nationalist, Extremist into Congress & White House
3/3 HOW MANY AMERICAN MEN, WOMEN,. CHILDREN, VETERANS,DISABLED will GOP Voters ALLOW their Party 2 Hurt? ask them how they sleep
2/3 ALLOW THEIR PARTY 2 MURDER by repealing ACA? facts(written by Heritage in 1997) they had all these years 2 pass it & didn't.
The real question U & all of us have 2 ask Republicans, Including DJT, but mainly Voters is this, HOW MANY AMERICANS WILL THEY
I hope you also make it clear to Seniors voting Rep finally have badly affected them, not just throwing younger gen under bus!TY
Al, he was assured a win working w Conway & Manafort. It'll happen again& again if we "move-on" to go fwd. There is no forward
@6grade56 senator if we no how corrupt the man is why does PBO have to follow through with oath on a bible ?
We're counting on you & your fellow Senators & Congress critters! Thank you 4 all your hard work.
@VABVOX Thank You!
Hey, Al. Could you also do something about this impending nuclear war? Much appreciated.
@VABVOX we seniors need a voice. Surely not all republicans want to screw senior citizens. We deserve what we paid into
@VABVOX WE NEED U THANKS
Thank you, Sen. Franken. I'd be dead without it.
Sure would be nice if someone would let the @GOP, @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr know this is what they're supposed to do.
Pl.stay committed to preserving Medicare&Medicaid! Ppl.who work pay into Medicare & deserve benefits & low-income need Medicaid.
Don't forget Social Security.
Send more Democrats my way, here on twitter, if you can. I'm suffering from republican regurgitation.
I freakin Love You, Al!
yay, hear, hear!
thank you Senator
@Geb_nut the strongRsupposd2DEFENDtHWEAK, not take advantage of them the elderly fought4the vry ppl thatRtrying2eviscerate them
You know? I've often wondered the same thing.
Think you Sen Franken for your hard work in the Senate
What about fighting privatization of the VA?
Too bad there aren't 52 of you. We're screwed
Throw in #SNAP
@HatticusFinch -& keep food stamp program too. (Fox News is suggesting that its too fraud-filled) b.s of course
How about preserving Social Security too?
RT'ed"@SenFranken, "@metaquest -, #Prev-RT, #Medicare, #Medicaid. mj (#p/NO-connection w/ANYbody-same Last Name)
Thank you!
Thank you Senator Franken. I'm so glad you're in the Senate!
please also commit to preserving insurance for those with preexisting conditions.
Thank u, also social security, because GOP doesn't give a damn about the little guy
Thanks, Al.
why do they try to take away programs the majority want? Just assholery
yup
fight back!
I've been terribly wrong all my yrs I thought congress was elected&was suppose to serve the public not kill them off
JPG, oh it's much much worse than that. See this. http://fairtaxgoofy.blogspot.com/ 
@PaulSorrentino3 Have you SEEN the plan?? I hear people saying they won't let @realDonaldTrump When did he SAY he WOULD? #PROOF
Hoping the Senate/Congress agree to save both,
Thank u Senator 4 fighting good fight on behalf of we the people. Repubs want to cut Medicare & SocSec 4 tax cuts 4 the rich!
Thank you, Senator Franken. I beg you now to help expose PEOTUS' corruption, his massive debt & terrifying state of mental hlth!
Man gets on TV not even sworn in yet talking about jobs he's created-you'd think we'd rather wonna hear how we can stop this!
Thank you! @SpeakerRyan take a lesson from Dems.
Please do, Sir. I am one who if Medicaid goes, will literally die. I need Medicaid to afford my meds to live.
unfortunately that is their modus operandi..you got your work cut out for you (for us)..
thank you
@davidpsdem Thankyou
Hey @SenFranken are you also committed to SHOUTING #TREASON. Will you be the 1st senator to CHARGE #donald w #ConspiracyToCommitTREASON?
Thank you, Sen. Franken. You and the other Dems gotta fight this!!
Thank you, @SenFranken
. Senator, it sounds like Democrats are going to lie down and let them trash the constitution, lock us out &sell the farm.
I just hope to God that's enough
@MissLin68640163 I Al Franken!
@RobertH01920864 suggestion to you fight every thing about the national alt - right hatered
@KnudsenColleen you are a good man
@KnudsenColleen I am with you!
You go sir. You are right. Why should we have to beg for what we paid into our whole lives including SS.
Thank you for being a voice of sanity!!
Thank you Senator. No go back to D.C and fight them. Show the same respect that Obama has received
But DJT and the GOP are going to replace these programs with something better. It will be yuge! Bigly!
Thank you! For taking a STAND
Article 30 states "Misleading Congress and the American People in an Attempt to Destroy Medicare." IMPEACHABLE OFFENCE
@CJLavallee Mr.Franken Why are we not investigating Trumps business in Tawian purchased after election?Ukraine business? @funder
I don't understand their "vision" for America.Stepping over the dying to enter a hospital, homeless encampments, filth, broken?
@puppymnkey thank you Senator Franken. #uphillbattle
THANK YOU. I'm one that will be hurt. Please help us.
and the ACA I'm assuming?
@tenaj74 Thank you Sen Franken. Stand up for us!
Maybe people with "keep Gov't hands off our Medicare" signs could be strong allies & consequently leave GOP. #tcot #DNC
No it isn't Al, but it's ironic that certain voters KNEW what they were voting for, and they're crying about it now!
@puppymnkey Ted Cruz and #RadicalChristianExtremists henchmen need to be strongly fought as well with this BS RFRA thing
@puppymnkey can you do something about blocking the Fed RFRA bill being proposed? It's only gonna shred the entire constitution
What kind of pol. are you Al?! Care about the people? (Thanks)
Resist!
Thank you, Senator Franken.
Thank you. If we on Medicare are forced off we would then be of the group- pre-existing conditions. How could we get insurance?
How are you going to save it with repugs in power and the #PUSSYGRABBER in office?
WE ARE WITH YOU! No more expecting others to carry the ball alone. WE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP WITH OUR HAIR ON FIRE.
How come you didn't list the ACA exchanges? Pls don't be fooled. It's a critical piece of the puzzle. @ASlavitt
and Social Security...!
I'm looking forward to you being one of the most important voices of reason in the Judiciary Committee in the coming year.
Thanku. My disabled son is depending on u & other #Democrats to preserve fdr policies & democracy of our beautiful free nation
You go Al! - Sr. in AZ.
What happened to the self proclaimed Republican Christian conservatives? Why are they persecuting Jesus?
Also what about Social security? That must be stopped it cannot be put in the hands of Wall Street bankers.
I'm very frightened about this. I've seen my 401Ks go through two "corrections." My broker doesn't want me to move $.
How? All the Dems have to stand together and bring four or five Republicans over to stop it from happening.
You could care less about your constitutes. You made that clear. http://www.snopes.com/al-franken-superdelegate-judgement/ …
1/ A lot of people voted for trump because they believed the Democratic Party wasn't representing them or their needs.
2/Actions like this only re-enforced these beliefs
Please run for President in 2020. (With Barney Frank as your VP! Franken & Frank in 2020! The double-Jewish ticket!)
@DrXPsychologist Thank you Senator. Pls have a chat w/ @SenSchumer and tell him to grow a pair
Well said sir
Fight Trump & the GOP every step of the way! We will fight with you!
I feel more confident that you will stand up for us than I do about any other elected official- except Bernie, of course. :)
@pdq8ball Thank you!
@freelancewoman Looks like Jan 3rd the GOP will bury Medicare Privatization in a reconciliation package to get some D support?
. @SenFranken counting on your voice. We will provide the pressure
@stacy_friday sometimes u have to let ppl fall in order that they recognize their mistakes ,wrong decision face reality
Climate Change also hurts the vulnerable the most. Please hang tough on this issue.
TY!!!
As a disabled American, I LIVE ON SS & Medicare! Yes Sir, lives depend on it - Thank you from one who worked on your campaign!!
thank you #staystrong ##staytrue
@RiseUpAbove Thank God. Seniors have contributed enough! Enough is enough and too much is nasty; go get 'em Al #NeverMyPresident
Senator, these programs along w/SS have to be protected. W/o them we become just another country. They work well. Stop the R's
@LOLGOP We have to work out here and are counting on you to stop this monster. Get him in the poker asap
Good for you
@Kamgirl47 thank u! Please investigate the Russian interference in the election, Trump and his businesses & Comy. Stop Trump plz
@vsansome Hi, Al! #ResistTrump #ImpeachTrump #UniteBlue
@IndivisibleTeam Don't forget protecting/enhancing Soc Sec. Already a bill introduced attacking it!http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/12/09/top_republican_releases_social_security_plan.html?wpsrc=sh_all_tab_tw_bot …
and as a recipient of Medicare I thank you for your efforts
Thank you, Sen. Al :-)
@CarlaMoulton3 ... then expecting the rest of us to jump in and save them. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR VOTE
@CarlaMoulton3 But at some point the most vulnerable have to stop VOTING FOR the assholes that keep trying to screw them! ...
you r exactly right
counting on you, Senator!
thank you! Please do. Even with Social Security. It's not right. We paid into these programs for years with our paychecks
fox ran a segment on getting rid of food stamps. Hello next war....
@shawsaluto And Social Security!
Thank you @SenFranken ..save our medicare/medicaid Amen🕇
@SheilaInCT thank you Senator!
Try amping it up a few notches please!! We are not in a class. This is real life.
Senator, plz get out the message about "how" those $ are being used in states and not helping the poor since "reform"
@breton_anne Thank you, Senator Frankenstein
Thank you! For standing up for the people! I really appreciate it! God Bless!
@RachelK1967 The other side are protecting what they deem vulnerable, those poor corporations sucking the life out of us.
I'm Canadian, I wouldn't trade our system for anything. Hearing of people not able to get the help they need is heartbreaking.
I have loved your SNL World Events bits, and you'd say how we must have been concerned how it affected you-Al Franken! So witty
A society should be judged on how they care for the young and old. We suck. We are about to suck more I fear.
What would happen if somebody started calling these people out as the competitive, addicted, money hoarders they are? Rehab?
Financial fears of losing support complicate an already painful and debilitating life, so thank you for being ther voice.
@Yvonne4166 and Social Security, PLEASE
Thanks Al!
Setting the bar pretty low, Senator. When are you going to use your smarts and take some big risks?
Thank you Senator!
Thank-you for your service & upholding the Constitution.
@neeratanden Thank you, Senator!
don't forget social security
So far Sen Franken is one of few speaking out loud for us! Where are the rest of the @SenateDems ????
@BillSou Thank you.
you're welcome!
Thank you, Sen. Franken. We have a long road ahead.
@YouCowardlyLion what about social security?
Thank You Senator Franken!! Will be there 4 the fight. Pls let us know what is happening, what we can do!!
Please do more, senator. Speak louder. Attack. Don't play nice. This is life or death for many people
@98cowboys Thank you Senator Franken. We need Democrats protecting us.
AND social security Al! PLEASE RUN AL!! We must all do what we can to stop donnie cocksplat. Our country is at stake
@mattyglesias do me a favor, and tell Paul Ryan he's a dick...from me.
Walmart employees are the largest group of Medicaid recipients. They are also the single biggest group of food stamp recipients.
@mattyglesias Thank you, Senator.I am caregiver for 89 y/o Grandpa. Am terrified of P.Ryan's thirst to destroy Medicare.
I cared for my mom until nursing home. Lost half the farm to that. Losing parents and farm rips my soul.
@Michelle_888 Please. We Dems are begging you. No memes. Fight the bastards!!! Where the hell are u guys. This is war!
@LOLGOP They seem to forget that part abt "promote the general welfare" in the first line of US Const. Gov't is NOT a business.
@boundry19 You can't do it alone.
please do! A lot of us depend on someone on Washington to keep us safe! Medicare and Ss came out of our pockets, not Ryan's!
let me know what I can do to help?Thank You very much senator,there are a lot of people worried,and nervous,and want to fight.
Thank you. what about Social Security?
thank you, Senator. You are one of the good guys.
