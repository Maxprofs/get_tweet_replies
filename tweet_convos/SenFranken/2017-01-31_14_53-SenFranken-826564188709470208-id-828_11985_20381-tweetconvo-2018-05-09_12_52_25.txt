I'm in Texas, I may as well be yelling at a tree in my yard.
I don't think you should feel that way...what if all the blue hiding in a big red state started speaking out together?
You’ve never been here have you?
ha! Only the airport. But I will say, my folks moved to NC a decade ago and it has grown ridiculously more liberal since
Maybe, but it’s still being black in a no black zone is still punishable by death there.
change the zoning board today, school board in a few years, then a rep, then who knows...don't give up! Be strong :) <3
I’m old and tired.
I hear ya, I'm just not sure this is a fight we should/can give up on
It makes them hate you.
Delete your account.
Thx.
then why are we known as "cry babies"? U believe we are stupid. We arent u all had stopped working for us long ago.
- Sen. Franken your direct and fact filled rebuttal opposing Sen. Sessions reminds me of Sen. Ted Kennedy. Inspiring.
@AllieLarkin Sure doesn't feel like it. SC Senators have pretty much spit in our faces here. @SenatorTimScott @LindseyGrahamSC
Remind them of that now & at election time.
Bet your ass I will!
@cjdrgg except when it's @SenToomey . then it makes no difference. Party hack. 60,000 Betsy DeVos campaign dollars.
@LeslieMarshall Regardless, your behavior is still embarrassing & unbecoming. Sigh
@catawu Keep up the fight & think about 2020! (If we make it)
2018. Vote on Every Office, everywhere in 2018. Local, State, Federal.
@leftnotright Sir, it sure doesn't seem that way.  I've called emailed & sent tweets @senrobportman he doesn't seem to care.
Millions of us are taking your advice...I think they are noticing :)
How about tweets? Bernie would have won. And you, Sir, are on the People's SH!tList >> http://vcbestor.blogspot.com/2016/06/wanna-add-to-our-version-of-hillarys-st.html …
.@SenFranken Thank you! I needed that right now!! 
@neeratanden I've put them into my phone contacts!
I call and write postcards, but I'm pretty sure my NC Senators don't care about a word I say. @zeitgeistbabe
Even more reason to call them. Let them know that they have constituents that oppose their agenda. Harangue the fools!
Are we going to #DumpDevos or what? That lady is clueless!
Al love ya but I don't think it does..otherwise the tangerine wouldn't be in power still..
@TruckersVote I've got @congbillposey and @marcorubio. It is not going to help, even though I have called several times. The
Tell that to us in #Wyoming @SenatorEnzi has a full voicemail box.And despite what his constituents say,he voted for #DeVos. :(
Not sure @JohnCornyn or @tedcruz are listening but Texans are talking to them...America's children deserve better than DeVos
but does it help to call elected officials from other states?
@obsessivelyMe no it doesn't. Unless we have money to buy a congressman from the NRA or big oil we are voiceless
@bonuslife ask @senrobportman if it does...
I wish you could do more. I admire you for taking the stance you did in the confirmation hearings
Thanks Senator!
sadly, my senators don't check their voicemail or reply to their social media and blindly follow. #GeorgiaProblems
It's time for Democratic leadership to publicly speak out against the riotous activity that is censoring conservative venues!
wish u were my Senator I'm stuck with @LindseyGrahamSC and @SenatorTimScott one has half a spine the other has no spine at all
how about tweeting him- does that count :)
I love you Al
He's smart enough, he's good enough, and gosh darn it, people like him! :D
I think if anyone has the courage to stand up and fight for us now it's Al. And @SenGillibrand, she's good.
And @SenSherrodBrown. He always has our back.
.@SenFranken thank you for fighting the good fight for education
Thank you for your good use of your good brain. We need you
Thanks. Can you let .@SenatorBurr know that our Dem strategy is simply to protect public ed & our children. He sounded confused
unfortunately that's not true in NC thanks to @senatorBurr
I think he may live to regret not taking his constituents seriously. This is about kids not politics
he doesn't care. He's not running for reelection again. He just doesn't care about his constituents. He's an ass.
ah. I didn't realize that. I'm from NJ but was so disgusted by him today 
But @OrrinHatch received thousands of calls and emails against DeVos and he still didnt listen to his constituents... @SenFranken
@hypocoristicon1 Voting is much more effective!
Thank you for fighting for us Senator. We need you.
I love you, Al, @SenFranken
What if they are already on my side?
If you can get through to anyone, which is like, impossible.
you're illegitimately elected, fraud & faux voters put u in
Thank you, Senator Franken. I appreciate your work. Keep up the fight. We're with you.
all of a sudden you want to hear from us?  Seriously ..
Not when it comes to Republicans. What else can be done Al? The Republicans aren't gonna stop him so who can do anything but us?
Too bad you don't have integrity or facts in your side.
I've been calling @SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue who obviously don't have our best interests in mind
@neeratanden thank you!
@DorisMurdock you rock, Al. Keep up the great work!
Even if we live in a backwards red state? (Texas)
I'm doing so daily.  Twitter, facebook, email AND phone.  Thank you for your efforts!
keep up the good fight, Senator!!!!
Thank you. We need to know there is *something* we can do.
@MacinEwa Sen Franken. What are we going to do? Trump is insane. How can he keep running our country?
Work with the Republican's. No boycott!
And it's very cathartic too! #DemocracyForAll is a 24/7 operation, not just once every four years.
No it doesn't make a difference. Vast majority of MN voters chose Bernie.  You said your judgment was more important, voted HRC.
ok then....this:
#NOFEDERALFUNDINGFORBERKLEY
what's most effective?  Phone calls? Letters? E mail? All of the above?
... +++ ...
Unless it's @SenToomey
That's good - b/c we aren't stopping. This man is dangerous - lots of distractions - but he is dangerous. #resist
@MattMcNeilShow any Democrat who works with republicans needs voted out. Fuck the high road. Obstruct

@norml How do we find out whom our state and federal representatives are?
. Happy to hear that. Am frustrated with so much going on
 Calling and emailing senators for first time
Hope they listen to me us
Will you oppose S.164 and H.R.424 ? Unregulated killing of wolves WITH NO JUDICIAL REV.IEW
@Leslie_Muse obviously not. How many TrumpDickHeads have you voted to confirm? 4 so you are not out of the hot seat, #HotOrCold
Enjoyed Watching you setting the record straight today, Well Done Sir and Thank You.
@js_edit Thank you Senator. I've called both my senators Schatz and Hirono this week. #TheResistance
If only you took your own advice regarding Bernie v Hillary, we wouldn't be in this mess.  #DNCIsNotBlameless
@BarbaranneWylde especially if it's Sen. Brat of Virginia, who thinks women shouldn't be seen or heard. @GOP
Don't you ever feel you're getting punked? And any moment Ashton Kutcher would come out to tell you, it was just a joke? I wish.
yes, but it shouldnt be required for leaders to...lead. Dont wait to be shamed into doing your duty. Just do yr job
I have watched every comment you have made during these sessions. Although always a fan, you make me want to be an Minnesotan!
My State Rep and Senator are anti-Trump but I called both offices to express my support and gratitude.
Can you find 1 more Repub. Sen. who will vote v. DeVos? <hands folded in prayer>
(Voting, on the other hand, don't mean jack. Cuz I'm a superdelegate, and MY vote is the only one that counts!)
Keep fighting for us Sen. & Keep voting no on nominees & SCOTUS. Thank you.
@msbellows Thank you, Senator Franken!!!
Thank you! And thank you for supporting students with your No vote for Devos!
@ScottEvon It's a little disheartening when you hear that your Republican @SenToomey has turned his phones off to avoid calls
, ask @RepTomEmmer if he agrees. And then ask him if he stands with his Muslim constituents in the #6thdistrict.
Al, I have loved you ever since the guy in the gorilla suit.
It's never budged Coryn or Cruz a centimeter--they just pull their gold-plated shells closed and go right on.
please tell your friends to answer their phones!
Thank you!  Some so called Congressional insiders trying say that petitions go immediately into the cylindrical file!
Except for @senrobportman. Unless it directly affects him (same sex marriage) he doesn't care.
Al Franken has always been a bad comi-dian.  Well, he makes me laugh!
Trump once handed me two passes for an Atlantic City buffet..do you know if,as president, he  still has them?.
If they answer the phone. I haven't been able to get through to mine in days.
Thank You for your hard work and putting that Texas Yahoo! in his place! also for letting Prince Albert out of his can
@mame6432 sent 2 senator letters, 1 rep letter, and 3 news outlet letters today.
@cristela9 not if it's Oklahoma cause they don't give a fuck
@LVSelbs took this advice, called my senator about the upcoming Sessions vote. The rub: my senator is@SenatorSessions. #awkward
you are amazing! Thank your for what you're doing!!!
unless your rep is a racist gasbag like @jeffsessions then you're pretty much screwed
if your elected officials actually care about their constituents opinions...which the GOP and several Dems appear not to
unless you are stuck with @tedcruz who hides...
It's not easy when you have to do it via 3rd party who sees you on video. (video relay) If I can do it anyone can.
what about folks on committees that are making recommendations?  I've been bugging them (you) too.
Which Rep. Senator would likely vote against DeVos? Who should we cal
like ur superdelegate vote??
my elected officials are generally good. I mean-I can only complain about @SenFeinstein for God's sake. So I'm calling others
what about when you have a Sen like @SenToomey who won't answer his phones ???
I'm not so sure we're breaking through in NC, but we'll keep chipping away.  #RESISTANCE
please talk to our crazy contingency from WI (minus Tammy Baldwin of course) they all need an attitude adjustment. #saveus
what about calling or writing officials outside of your district or state?
doing our best.  In NY but still calling.
Thanks for the reassurance @SenFranken that maybe someone is listening & can be motivated to act #ILoveAmerica #TrumpHasDelusions
thank you senator Franken for your courage standing up to right-wing radicalism
I live in CO. I've called Gardner 3x & never get a live person. He's complained that he just gets calls from "paid protesters."
Pls urge your colleagues to vote "NO" for DeVos. Thank you, Senator!
@MR_PRIME69 Call out the Berkley False Flag as being orchestrated by Trump Family aficionados... Propaganda Chrystal Nights...
We need more information/facts. We know it was a protest against Bannon.  @SenFranken
many of them turned off their phones.
thank you for everything you're doing!
@BronwynAnn @LauraWilker !!!
@lz000 good to hear! DEMs have taken us voters for granted. That's over start earning votes. Stop assuming you have them already
what about Tweets? As they're POTUS preferred channel, these count somehow, yes?
Makes all my calls and voicemails feel like they matter. That *I*, my community, & MN matters! I remain a grateful resident, @SenFranken!
GOP would shut down the government if tables were reversed.  Don't give them an inch. Go after their favorite cash cow contracts
can you and other Dems help us get through to Reps hiding from us? Turning off phones & the like? We need help to reach them.
I don't have a Senator b/c I live in DC, but my Minnesota mom has called your office on issues we both care about. Thank you!
even when their voicemail box is full? Does @Twitter count for writing? Thanks , earnestly.
That was yesterday. Today the GOP pushed through Munchkin and Pricetag and we have T-rex for sec. of state.
You didn't listen when your state overwhelmingly voted for Bernie.
@jeffmillerla SEEEEE
@AlexShapiroPR you're awesome, Al. It goes without saying, but no on DeVos please.
Not in Tennessee. Our reps are oblivious to their constituents!
woah I just called you today! Are you saying you actually listened to me, the angry guy named Carl?!
(btw this is us )
it's not making enough of a difference.  Impeach him now!!!  Please, put country first.  Before we are a Fascist regime!
Could you maybe call Toomey for us? His VM is full.#toomeyanswerthedamnphone
AAAAAL. What in the world is Sn Klobuchar voting for. What am I MISSING
Yeah, but I have run out of names to call them.
even the Repubs?! I try but it is so frustrating.
Does emailing work also?
even when they are Republican?
@CeeLeeMusic Until senators turn their phones off...
@EscaleraCat Senator Toomey took phone off hook- not even giving pretense of listening to constituents
This admin.is nothing but a power grab.They will push the agenda they always wanted. Christmas for GOP.

Thank you for standing up for so many of us!
which is better?
but is it okay if I call them by proxy, it counts, right?
@LadyDemocrat1 can you give me @marcorubio's direct? No damn way #BetsyDeVos should be allowed in a school much less the DOE.
I'd love to believe you.  Unfortunately I live in Wisconsin. Need I say more?
@ChuckGrassley not answering his phone/listening to meesages...
lol maybe for yr constituents. I live in NC and my senator addresses his nonanswers to "Mr. Wallace"
Thank you for your strong statements regarding Jeffrey Sessions and your no vote, although he still got voted in. Heartbreak.
does sending chocolates help?
Thanks for trying today.  Working with a bunch of bricks is hard, isn't it. Fight back hard. Get a strategy and focus
Why do @PRyan & the @WhiteHouse have the phone lines off? 
We pay their salaries! 
They work for us! 
#Resist
@JEDBPK Unless if it's @SenToddYoung Because he is a fucking smuck!
I wish I lived where @SenFranken lives.
@JoshGeog That is of said representative takes the call, keeps lines open for messages
55417 here--stop being reasonable in your voting. Stop voting for any Repub cabinet members. Now. Stop. Now.
really? Because it looks to me that no matter what we do, the GOP will just change the rules and renders it moot.
Gov being hijacked. Dems better have eyes open & stand strong! We're doing our part!
I'm sure it might if you were my senator. I called Sen. Burr (& Tillis) re: DeVos...not that either really care.
I called my senator's office ALL DAY today Dean Heller Nevada All 3 #'s answer machine full D.C. Busy ! That's ok we vote 2018!
here's the thing (and I am a democrat) fighting each other like school yard children is clearly not working. Fix it.
What does it say about competency of our Rep. that it takes 1000s of calls/emails for a Sen to not vote for an obviously unqualified person.
More diff for some than others. Heightened engagement has been the bright side of the past 13 days.
Even if he's Dick Shelby or Mo Brooks?
Only if you can get through. @SenToomey likes to ignore his constituents.
please vote no on Betsy Vos!!!!
Not when you are "represented" by @SenToomey - could not get through all week. Can't effect change if I can't reach his office.
I finally got through once, today, but my other family members cannot reach him at all. We feel abandoned.
I did, however, see YOU speak today. You were clear and eloquent and LOGICAL. Thank you.
@sandi_childs hasnt made Ron Johnson listen at all. All GOPs are leveraged with the hacked RNC emails. They are all cowards.
@AnnTruwe keep fighting AL we are behind you! #TheResistance
unless your senator is macro Rubio
thank you for your questions and statements around these confirmation hearings. Keep fighting the good fight.
what if you live in DC and don't have representation?  Can I call you? @DCstatehood51
My personal opinion of Devos...
went to the capitol to speak with reps. only able to see aides who seemed bothered to speak with me about research funding
I LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU!! YOU sir, Rock the house!  You are the MAN today & at DEVOS hearing--PRICELESS!!!
Ok then, vote for Trump's picks :)
I've been trying to get a hold
Of @SenOrrinHatch the last 4 days with no avail.  I will keep trying, and I've also emailed!
I love you too!
Get used to full voicemails, full mailboxes, multiple tweets, EMs, letters for a while! @SenFranken @SenateDems #RESIST
Thank you.  
An aside ... @SenToomey mailbox is full for a week. Not fair!
@danachis I respectfully disagree. @SenCoryGardner blanket ignores me
You are a champion. We will win. Not American.
Republican Sen VM boxes have been full for a week. They are hiding from their constituents
but what hope do we have? pieces all set for a truly rigged game (exec, legisl, judicial)
I wish with all legislators it actually did make a difference; friend called OK senator & was told he'd still approve DeVoes.
even though ALL of the calls he has gotten at the time were asking to not approve.
@mch7576 you are a Rock Star standing up to Session  and Cruz Epic awesomeness you are my hero Thank You!
@neeratanden Unless their mailboxes are full & they ignore all else, as @SenToomey in PA seems to.  

@SenToomey -PA wants INFO
...we know



keep encouraging us!
@cajunsmiley But Al, seriously, name one bigwig in politics who has EVER really been held accountable? Even Nixon resigned.
THANK YPU!
Keep up the good fight senator Franken. All of your hard work is very appreciated.
@anylaurie16 been calling the crap of our #gop #pawn @SenCoryGardner blue states vote!
It only helps if the answer the phone. @sendavidperdue @SenatorIsakson are either always busy or the mailbox is full. #Shameful
@anylaurie16 Teach, Senator Franklin. Amen!
Not in Kentucky, my elected official is Mitch McConnell 
Nice work today. Keep it up!
Or ditch out of their own town halls early. @RepMikeCoffman
