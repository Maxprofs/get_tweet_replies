@johndickerson John, what did Sen. McConnell say this morning when you confronted him with this...Hmmm


I'll see your Impastor and raise you a Blobby
When @SenFranken @SenateMajLdr @went through "the elevator" johndickerson
@The_Borg_Queen_ @SenateMajLdr I live in Ky, do the ethical thing for once, follow the rules you set for President Obama!
Call your senator tomorrow and demand the background checks.
Senator Rand Paul: 202-224-4343; Senator McConnell (202) 224-2541.
Seriously; they need to hear from YOU. Write a script, be ready to leave a message. Include your name & zip.
thank you!  You rock!  
Good Job Sen. Franken!
Nah, that only applies to Democrats! Republicans don't need no stinkin rules! Make The Rich gtreat again!
@SenateMajLdr
haha Stuart from snl
@WDW_Dreaming @SenateMajLdr The chance that PEOTUS could sit through or answer any of these questions, intellgently, is zero.
state facts you twit
Franken 2020!
Do you?
I faxed this to his office with a polite cover letter reminding him of his position. 202 -224-2499
79 bill have been pushed through the house with no debate in such a speedy manner dems have no time to review them and or debate or amend.
Did @SenateMajLdr respond? He wrote an excellent letter in 2009, after all. It deserves a response.
@DesleyAndrew @SenateMajLdr McConnell is the definition and poster child of hypocrisy. He has placed party before country
McConnell is also poster child of someone to old to serve. His opinions are old
You mean like the GOP SOB/Traitors who penned a letter to foreign govt behind the back of the American ppl? Yeah, talk comedy! @HalfFull0
Amen why is only democrats are wanting to use the constitution and constitutional law to conduct government affairs
Frankenstein your a hollywierd flunky , go crawl back under your rock and stop using UN SUBSTANTIATED QUOTES
.@SenFranken .@PhyllisCopeland .@SenateMajLdr the public has a right to know what type of conflicts of interest Trump has
& i think we all know he has a HUGE investmentN Russia4he takes up 4 Putin Daily
DT's stand on Putin does make me wonder about holdings in Russia
You ask that of the guy who filibustered himself! Hypocrisy is what Mitch does best.
@Terryoneill @SenateMajLdr I'm old enough to remember when Al was funny.
thanks for your standing up for right
Looking forward to an answer. Not holding my breath. Keep pushing, Al.
you know  @SenateMajLdr is a turncoat partisan hack who only follows rules for his favor. No @GOP has balls to stand up to DT.
Sen Franken..he has two sets if standards..his and his big money interests..only what suits them!
No ethics no hearing!simple-follow the same rules that Mitch put back in 09 being the minority party-have we already turned in2 kleptocracy?
stay strong! #GOP must standup 2 Trump&Advisors manipulating laws 2push personal agendas-NOT good 4the people-NO 2 Sessions 4 AG
No he doesn't. He is a liar and a cheat. He is the lowest form of human that exists along with the rest of the GOP
Do you remember Mitch? I'm sure you do.
lay down and scream@
watch Monday's @democracynow news report. IMHO Trump is holding a news conference the same day as a distraction
They're hypocritical and shameless creatures of the swamp!!  #NOINTEGRITY!
that was a black democrat as president. Soooo 2008
@jag7337 @SenateMajLdr  Please speak up. Or do those rules only apply when you want to obstruct #NOTNORMAL
yes, we the American people still like ACTUAL vetting. It's policitical suicide otherwise.
And when he says NO you will say OK because democrats just roll over as usual
HOW ABOUT IT MCCONNELL?
He has no ethics, he has no standards, he has sold the United States to the highest bidder - Comrade Putin
@neilpX @SenateMajLdr you cannot and must not approve of sessions
Consistency is EVERYTHING for nominees! You and Sen. Schumer are RIGHT ON.
@ngunn7 @SenateMajLdr Obviously not, but we will hold them to it!
LOL, don't be silly!  Of course not! That was only for OBAMA nominees. Everyone else gets a pass!
any response from @SenateMajLdr? You gotta respond and since our country restricts itself to <140 characters / get busy!
#HoistWithHisOwnPetard
FuckingSleazeball #McConnell
mitch is really not worthy of being called 'Senator' @SenateMajLdr he's a bit of a 
Thank you, @SenFranken for your leadership & integrity. We need more politicians like you. @SenateMajLdr, take notes. #NoEthicsNoHearing
The epitome of hypocrisy. Shame on you Leader McConnell. Maybe you should actually lead by taking your own advice.
When has Washington cared about ethics?
@SFL4Hillary @SenateMajLdr 
GREAT QUESTION! Unfortunately the answer in NO he doesn't!

@JLongGallegos @SenateMajLdr I hope that hypocrisy will take a back seat to patriotism. DO THE RIGHT THING! #DoYourJob
@lks62 @SenateMajLdr Have the duplicate hearing times been resolved yet?
doesn't practice what he preaches. He practices hypocrisy. Refused to adhere to constitution on nominee
Good question. Have you received an answer?
Thank you for refusing to allow the ethics standards to be side tracked.
I do wish you had enough time to do some comedy bits about all this... Thanks for your service!
The ONLY thing consistently transparent about The GOP is their CORRUPTION!
let's just change the rules for trump nope the people will not allow it
SPEAK! We need to hear you fight against this steamrolling machine for Trump!! Where are you!? Get on media, ptotest in Senate!!
Is This Mitch McConnell for real? His hypocrisy is literally mind blowing. History will not be kind to him.
STAND STRONG AGAINST the incoming Putin-puppet dictator! Thank you, #TheResistance
that only applies to democrats duh
#NoEthicsNoHearing
You hold them to their own words, Al. You have our whole-hearted support in this.
@mdcolli @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @Reince @maddow @senrobportman @SenJohnBarrasso @SenJohnThune GOP hypocrits true colors.
McConnell has zero ethics
McConnel's wife Elaine Chao's father's company caught shipping coke; huge conflict of interest for a Sec of Trans.
Cowardly old turtle man dodged Vietnam in 1967, I went in his place. Optic neuritis is treatable
No vetting? No vote. Thanks Senator Frankenstein. Wish u were my Texas senator.
@TrumpResist @SenateMajLdr Thank you, Sen Franken!  Stay on it for us - 65,844,610 of us have your back!
has McConnell responded yet? Pretending he didn't see this?
I'm assuming this is  a rhetorical question!
@ThisSucks2017 @SenateMajLdr thank you Sen Franken. Oh Yes! #EthicsPlzVetAll
@Shari2112 @SenFranken @SenateMajLdr  No!
Thank you, Sen Frankenstein!
@MattMurph24 @SenateMajLdr asking for a friend
I really do hope that is the case because anything less would be disingenuous and might appear to favour his wife
Oh it's fine.
@brontyman @SenateMajLdr /Those same rules have 2 b followed.After all they're n black&white. Force ethics rules 2 b followed!!!
@brontyman @SenateMajLdr
@HeSlimedMeRay @SenateMajLdr Many of us have asked him the same question today. Silence is deafening
It was fixed to be sent back to Majority Hypocrite by @SenSchumer !
GOP are hypocrites. #TheResistance
the people of America believe your words matter , do the right thing.
@denise2r @SenateMajLdr  One of the multitude of reasons why Trump was elected.  All of you are hypocrites!
"Ready or Not, Republicans Say Cabinet Hearings Will Begin Tuesday" http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/us/politics/cabinet-hearings-senate-republicans-donald-trump.html …

@SenateMajLdr  <-- #WheresTheSwamp?
Yes, Senate Majority Leader, answer Senator Franken's question! Aren't Republicans the party of the Rule of Laws?
Yeah FK @SenFranken ! That short sighted SOB is 1 of the many reasons we're stuck with that POS @realDonaldTrump @nicolesandler Dems r toast
@MISenDems @demoStand for what is right! Sit in or what ever it takes. Do not allow this hypocrisy.
@Honey17011 @SenateMajLdr The letter needs to be enlarged and brought to next nomination hearings.just to refresh his memory
Don't confirm squat Al.
you @SenFeinstein and @KamalaHarris better make sure @SenateMajLdr doesn't cripple our democracy. counting on you.
Doubtful. It was never about ethics or standards. But it's ALWAYS about partisanship with @GOP @SenateGOP
Why would he when those same standards didn't apply for POTUS? #fucktrump
And when you call to discuss they hang up on you.
McConnell needs to understand we are asking for nothing more than what he demanded in 2009
POST ON SENATE FLOOR HAVE THEM READ IT
When Trump said he'd'shake up DC' wasn't expected to mean 'dodging accountability & normal vetting'
He has to get his wife confirmed somehow.
#TalkingTurtle
Thank you!
Please keep calling out the hypocrisy of @SenateMajLdr like blocking @POTUS SCOTUS nominee after he won 2 landslide elections
@jodotcom @SenateMajLdr Of Course Not!
Mitch has selective ethics; bribes and handouts "Trump" honor and integrity every time.
Silly Senator, rules and ethics don't apply to Republicans. They had no problem with treason, long as they won.
Don't you guys work in the same building? @jodotcom @SenateMajLdr
Now Al u know those were only meant 4 Ds the GOP hv NO morals or ethic standards they think they can do anything @SenateMajLdr
No, Senator Franken, they were issued in the 3rd Person - Your Standards. No longer applicable! Thanks for asking!
Of course not when do Republicans care about ethics in relation to their power? when?
@Shanny_resqchi @SenateMajLdr
And the response is "...only if it benefits our party agenda". Shameful!
@CassandraCorvid @SenateMajLdr Uh, nope.
Pretty sure his answer is NO. Please Senator Franken, fight hard!
@zerogeefootball @SenateMajLdr people, please call your senators. A call is more powerful than a tweet, email or FB post.
Mitch did bring his to work with him today so he will not be able to read and respond. Try back after nominations
we need more than words we need action, no action = stolen democracy.
Thank you.  Not about the election. About the standards.
call your senators. It took me less than 5 minutes of my time to do this
Keep pointing out that McC is doing this to protect his wife who is up for a position.
Point out the nepotism repeatedly to hammer it in.
Sen. Franken, please fight this with everything you've got!
McConnells hypocrisy is breathtaking. Perhaps we should erect a monument to it?
Thank you, Sen. Franken! Sen. McConnell, you set a standard for vetting nominees.  Will you follow your own rules?
Pls stand up to this mockery and do not vote for trumps completely unqualified cabinet appts

Senator McConnell:what is the value of your (written, signed) word?
@damonbethea1 @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SenSherrodBrown  We can't let rich $mill and $bill appointees SKIP vetting!
@damonbethea1 @SenateMajLdr  @realDonaldTrump @robportman  Country NEEDS clear, transparent vetting of Trump appointees
Of course he doesn't. Now it's our time to be sure that their president is a one term president via obstruction. @SenFranken @SenateMajLdr
- why can't Dem Senators put "holds" on nominations? GOP Senators known for this tactic! #ethicsmatter
Because his wife has a Cabinet position given to him by Donald; it's clear #McConnell is bought and sold.
He obviously doesn't, has one standard for democrats and no standards for republicans. Corrupt GOP.
Let me answer for the very busy man, @SenFranken, -  "No, Trump is white." 

You're welcome, @SenateMajLdr.  
I hope, Sen. Franken, you will read this aloud at the hearings.
U rock, Sen. FRANKEN  Keep the pressure on. Do not vote 4 any nominees until all requires met.
Thank you Senator Franken for standing firm. No hearings without the proper ethics review!
As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
#resistanceparty     if not, why? Answer before even first hearing!
That's a rhetorical question, right, Al? You becoming a Senator was a huge loss to comedy, btw.
I'd like to know the answer to this question....
Thank you for bringing this up, Senator Franken. Keep at it!!
please stand with the ppl and Demand he support the standards he wanted in 2009.
do you?
Thanks 4 reminding them that what goes round comes around and I hope they'll remember the Supreme Court vacancy 2
no, Mitch does not.
@NaYaKnoMi @SenateMajLdr Thanks for postin this @SenFranken !
We are all waiting for a response please. #stopSessions #NoConfirmations w/o vetting!
@politicalmiller @SenateMajLdr yep I think these are the rules that should apply. Glad you stated regardless of majority party!
@MitchMcConell What say you Turtle man????!!!! #hipocracy #doublestandards #TheResistance
I called my reps. today! Each one of his picks need to be vetted! Or face backlash for years!
Audacious move by the GOP in direct opposition to their demands of Dems in the nomination process. Why do they get a free ride?

Republicans only believe in ethics for Democrats.  @SenateMajLdr has shown Republicans more interested in shmethics. #Treason
.@SenFranken @SenateMajLdr  Try Kentucky offices.  https://lwvky.org/your-government/federal-government/mcconnell/ …
I hear it's impossible to get through to D.C. Office.  Try #Kentucky offices.  https://lwvky.org/your-government/federal-government/mcconnell/ …
@politicalmiller @SenateMajLdr Mitch the same guy that said making Obama a one term prez is r goal and grid looked Congress
They SHOULD be vetted, but if you think you think it's going to be easy to take the high ground after the BS you guys pulled...
@TurnKyBlue @SenateMajLdr   Come on Mitch... all I hear are crickets...and the clock ticking...#doublestandards
Sen. Frankenstein, I will be calling today. You need to enforce the rules. Get the vetting completed!
This should be Franken.....My virtual speller. At least I hope I gave you both a smile. Now work together!
If Mitch will not go by procedure concerning ethics he should be forced from his position.
Hold trump's choices to same ethics standards as 2009.  #TheResistance
@ecclesias @SenateMajLdr Yes we do
Hypocrisy is a GOP value.
Trump is Putin's willing accomplice & must be held accountable before taking oath.
Only for dems hypocrite MUCH mitch? Ethics's Violations!
Probably McConnell doesn't support it.  Ethics are only in play for Dems.  GOP can do whatever they want
That's when O was in charge, we have to talk/act different in other words be obstacles to everything. Now #MAGA
Why doesn't the media respond with this info when confronted with this BS? Mitch is a hypocrite.
@Insurgent_Storm @SenateMajLdr thank you Sen Franken!!!
Rally your fellow dem. Senators and force accountability from McConnell and Repubs.
We love Harry Reid now we are going to use his Nuclear option..thanks, Harry!
Thank you Sen Al!
@AnonBruja @SenateMajLdr after your money laundering w/Hillary you don't get to say anything about ethics.
Of course he does not, ask in hearings are there connections btw Russia and @realDonaldTrump
@howard5591 And if you don't @SenateMajLdr you are the ultimate hypocrite! Well, you are the intimate hypocrite.
Once you allow access to codes,IRS,FBI,CIA to DT minions it's too late!!! Don't think behave better with our info?
You should follow YOUR OWN RULES Mr. Majority Leader !! @SenFranken
And if not, why not? Unvetted GOP nominees always end up mired in scandal. Does @gop want that?
Serious Q: How will you keep @SenMajLdr to uphold his own rigorous process? We need more of this.
Are those Standards or Double Standards?
Why would he support something that was meant for those "other" people? Mitch ONLY sees red; never blue. @SenateMajLdr
Or as I like to call it, The McConnell rule.
sold our jobs, stalked vets, women  in #gamergate. Stacks of felonies committed after Fargo hoarded jobs we built!
@elle_tb15 @SenateMajLdr apparently rules are only for Democrats to follow because the GOP was specially anointed by God?!
God don't like ugly either, and this crowd, for all their plastic surgery, is hideous.
made some weird voting habits,
but on this
we are crystal clear
@RLComedians know @realDonaldTrump = RL traitor!
@SenateMajLdr
I'm proud of my senator-@SenFranken Please hold Rs to same standards.  Especially with this group
Double standard much! They been waiting for this for many years now the will unleash the plans to destroy us
@creynoldsnc @SenateMajLdr why have ethics's in a trump dictatorship as long as his wife got a job he's all good without ethics
His position has changed since 2009. Because all he cares about is power! A special level of hell awaits his death
