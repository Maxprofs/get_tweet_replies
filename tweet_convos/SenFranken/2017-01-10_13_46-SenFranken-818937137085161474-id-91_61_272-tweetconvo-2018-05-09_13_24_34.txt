The only fraud is YOU Al.  Is there any evidence that California stopped illegals? No. Ask me about FL fraud..I'll tell you all about it.
Says man twting about fraud w a mask on. He's OK w Trump lying about taxes, too.
Will allow your ignorance of the 'mask' symbolism to pass since ur a duck Chuck! 
Ur #PEEOTUS lies about everything. That's what u should worry about. duck Chuck?
Nah #peeotus nailed it on @HillaryClinton and @POTUS. He's UR president too..if not, try Mexico or Canada. But UR all full of it. Noone goes
Hahahahaha even you're using #PEEOTUS you hack loser. And Obama is your #POTUS, traitor. Check the date.
Naaa...Obama's not my president.  He doesn't even know he's not black. How can he lead? He's mulatto jerko. #Trump #MAGA #usa
Fuck right off then you #racist #traitor #RussianCuck. You and your #lying #RussianPatsy #PEEOTUS. #AmericaFirst, asswipe
comedian/moron Franken grilling a true honorable statesman like Sessions is a pathetic joke
Your phone autocorrected "making a fool of Sessions" ...fixed it for you.
Look,that idiot comedian only got elected by a few ILLEGAL criminal votes
Trump only got elected by a few illegal Russian hackers.
Lost by 3m votes. Losing-est president in history. And a #traitor

For not going to law school, you did just fine. Thank you for today.
NOTHING you asked was relevant to Jeff Session USAG! All you did was try to trip him up! You made a fool of yourself
Since @SenFranken "won" his 1st election thru votes of felons & a suspect recount, he's a voter fraud expert
Hahahahaha! Your #OrangeJesus was installed by #Putin, and you whine about fraud? SMH
Putin revealed Hillary/Dems/press corruption, but voters "installed" Trump. Sorry...
The truth will set you free, Joe. So you better avoid it at all costs.
Truth: Sessions got death penalty for KKK member & bankrupted the local KKK. Gotcha!
Sen. Franken u r a disgusting & disrespectful human being,you're an embarrassment to this nation.
Donald Trump, #conman and #RussianPatsy is what Americans should aspire to be, right?
You better believe it pal.Don't like it, start packing
...like costing Macy's 10,000 jobs and getting his ass handed to him by @VicenteFoxQue
Thank you for calling him out and challenging bogus voter fraud claims! Nice work for a 'non-lawyer'
Let's discuss #Putins main #bitch http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-intelligence.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share …
Thank you, Senator Franken!
Jeff Sessions is an honest man & you led people to believe he isn't with INCOMPLETE information. That's lying!
Way to hammer on him, Al! Love it!
@ctlss @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary Please don't allow him to be confirmed!
Please listen to the Franken lies & attempts to distort the truth. @greta
Thank u @SenFranken for fighting for what #Democrats #Progressives believe in. Watching u on @CNN now. #ImWithHer
Wasting ppl's time- using hearing to spout your rehtoric,disagreement wi POTUS vs ?s to future AG
http://atfp.co/2e5eyhm 
Al, you did good.
Ask Sessions what he will do as an AG about Trump conflict of interest in case of terror attacks on his hotels.
Great job Al!
Didn't think it was possible but ur bigger embarrassment than @GovMarkDayton
So proud to have you representing Minnesota! Thank you!
You're a moron.  Go back to snl.  You have absolutely no business being a senator.  Disgusting.
NICE JOB!!! 
- @SenatorSessions is quick to point out the 5 to 4 vote on SCOTUS decisions where doesn't approve but not on the ones he does.
you were great! thank you.
you did a great job, keep it up.  Sounds like Sessions inflated his stats
You were great!!! @SenFranken @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
Thank you @SenFranken!! You're doing great!  @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
"Meaningful, tough questions?" You've GOT 2b kidding.Stuart Smalley, you are an uninformed idiot.
your a bafoon. Minnesota can do better
Thank you @SenFranken for your tremendous work.
@AnnCoulter Clearly you didn't understand the questions and statement written for you.
Thank you! Thank YOU! THANK YOU!   Sanity!

@AnnCoulter You should have practiced reading questions someone wrote for you before appearing on TV. Bad job.
Your attempt to make name for yourself-via your questioning-is nauseating; not over HRC loss I C @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
Thank you for standing up for the American people.
SCOTUS found Southern states now no more problematic than the rest of the country @SenFranken, maybe less so!
if there's an umbrella and you....wa, wah, wait... what? You still look like your on SNL
BTW..you're one goofy looking SOB. But I'm sure you've heard that before. Weren't you the ape in 'Trading Places'. U liked it in the end,no?
You did an awesome job!! Thank u for fighting for all Americans. U r a true patriot.
Good job, Al. Glad to see someone actually asking meaningful, tough questions. Cruz is a kiss-a**
Oh Great, the whinny ass Al Commie Nazi Franken is talking, Fanken is such a racist.
You are very negative toward @realDonaldTrump and @SenatorSessions.  Stop playing games and do your job. Approve. @senjudiciary
are you the only Democrat there?
Legend in ur own mind!
Didn't he get in by a few hundred ILLEGAL CRIMINAL VOTES! What a HYPOCRITE!!
Thank you to you, Al Franken.  #Sessionshearing
Listen, Al, U.S. citizens can vote.  Everyone should have a CITIZEN ID!  Get it?  NO.  You don't!
Ah, this is an example of the "truth, fairness, compassion" that's your profile
That's right.  All legal Americans should be able to vote.
Turn up the heat!!!!! you are doing great!
when you used evidence from a guy who lied about Sessions before?  Not a shining moment dude.
Thank you for calling him out on his lies! #feelthefranken #stopsessions
thank you for calling out N.C. on their voter suppression laws. TX does the same thing. Thanks for your comment to Ted Cruz too.
when your lies come back to haunt you. Voter suppression - "um, um, um ..." > GET 'UM AL <pride>
.@SenFranken @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary Interrupting Sessions BS response: "Okay... here's the thing.." How much do I love Al Franken!!!
It'd be much better to rubber-stamp #ComradeTrump's picks like they do in motherland!
#GOP
#eVerify Voter Registration & Employment
Pass Federal #VoterID Laws
Thank you!
.@SenFranken @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary "I'm not familiar with.." "North Carolina targeting African Americans with surgical precision"
Good job today!
