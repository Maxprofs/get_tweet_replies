For DT to say he likes people who don't get captured was a sophomoric, impulsive and smartass comment. It's who @POTUS is.
Please make them stop. Talk to @SenCapito & other reasonable Rs. Get them to vote No. 

My life hangs in the balance & frankly I'm scared.
Perfectly said!
They are motivated by extreme racist hate for Obama and want to kill his legacy and erase him from history. Their hate is strong!

There's no mystery, the current bill defunds planned parenthood for a mere 12 months. As a @GOP I wouldn't vote for that til it was perm.
Thank you senator you are looking out for your own interest.
Which is the welfare of the American people vs the tax cut for the wealthy.
All you want is free shit go work for it you want every thing handed to you that why you hang on to the Dems party you love them freebie.
Contrasting Senator McCain's speech today vs Trump's Boy Scout speech is clear who is a self sacrificing patriotic hero & who is a sociopath
They should have listened to Dave. But that whole generation of GOP is long gone.
#KillTheBill
@robportman not listening @SenSherrodBrown
Can we trust lawmakers who have made sex reassignment surgery a military benefit?  They have burdened taxpayers w/expense, no ins. co. wld?
Minnesotans deserve a #BetterDeal than having a Senator who stole Election by having Dem sec of state fight to toss out military votes!
Couldn't manage to dig up Lincoln for a quote?
@marcorubio @VernBuchanan zip34025. Please do not support Pres Trump's mystery plan. Improve existing ACA
Does sex reassignment benefit incl breast augmentation or mastectomies?  Do we follow up w/ psychological & hormone treatments? Can't trust
Vote no
Wasn't OBAMACARE a "mystery bill?"
@marcorubio @VernBuchanan Please vote to retain ACA then work across lines to improve it. My zip is 34205
Hopefully, one day Trump will learn that marginalizing America - like he's doing now - actually makes America weaker, not stronger.
What if @SenJohnMcCain had no healthcare? Yes people will die.
...and by 'in the years to come' he specifically means in November of 2018 and November of 2020...
Will any of the GOP listen?
Keep the pressure on your Republican "colleagues".
I agree!  Thank you to all in the House and Senate who stand up to the WH bully who is dismantling our democracy! :( Hoping for Karma kick.
Franken for President 2020!
Thank you  someone with common sense. You can't vote on a plain pad of paper with nothing in it. Again thank you 
I don't know, Al. I think you guys ought to vote on all legislation w/o knowing what it is. Adds a whole new dimension of intrigue.
Al Franken is an idiot and a commie.
Be a Patriot, get rid of him and 0bamacare.
Thank you

History will judge very harshly those who supported this immoral HC Bill, as well as those who did not stand up to Trump & his cronies
Voted for Durenberger back in the day. Quit voting for Rs when they went batshit crazy. Voted for @SenFranken instead.
How is it even possible that so many are even considering voting yes on this? Is it that whole 'what would you do for $1M'on a grand scale??
Good luck Al! Are you still taking care of that other stuff..net, bad judges, etc.? Hope so
Indeed !!
MN is far from perfect,  but I'm proud when our elected officials stand for what's right.
Yes, yes, yes and yes!!!  Please!
We do not want TRUMPCARE. The president needs to listen to the people.
Thank you Sir! We need our care!
Tell your GOP colleagues. Have Durenberger call them. Keep up the pressure.
Durenberger was one of the LAST Republicans I voted for.  He was knowledgeable and fair minded.
Lots of good stuff coming out of MN!
A Nation agrees!
Complete repel of Obamacare or hunt a job. All of you! Support Our President and do the things the people voted for!
What the f*** happened to your party?
A NO vote is the only MORAL vote


@SenDeanHeller where do you stand? #NoTrumpCare is the only defensible vote!
Thank you for your conscientiousness. I have end-stage liver disease - awaiting a transplant. I'm covered under the ACA. Trumpcare=death 4me
They could be liable for "Depraved Indifference Murder/Deaths" or so class action attorneys say as they rub their hands together & drool
#KillTheBill
Thank you for your common sense and your show of humanity. Both of you
Franken/Harris 2020
#trumpcare kills: The @GOP plan for #Obamacare could kill more people each year than gun homicides - Vox
Thank you, Minnesotans.
I need to move back to my home state. MN rules.
Gotta convince my boss
Pay attention @SenateGOP....VOTE NO! Americans will remember come election day! #RIPGOP2018
FULL REPEAL
Once the vote is taken and constituents start dying explain that to the masses
@senrobportman @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @JeffFlake @DeanHeller @SenJohnMcCain #TrumpCare #VoteNO
Thank you Senator
Ahh, a blast from when @gop had a shred of decency and morals. Good times.
Please Sen Franken, Congressman Ted Lieu, Sen Tim Kaine..Run 4 POTUS/VP
How can ANY Senator vote for a bill they (or their staff) haven't read?
Gee good question. Ask @NancyPelosi she's the one who said they had to pass Obamacare to know what was in it.
Democrats message on the economy is Americans deserve better, 7 months after a Democrat just spent 8 years in the WH
#ABetterDeal LOSERS
Thank you, Senator!  We have always had insurance and now buy thru exchange.  My husband has stage 4 kidney cancer.  ACA has saved his life!
The voice of reason. Are you listening #GOP ?
Thank you. Al.  Donno what we'd do without you and Amy!
Yes
A yes vote for something you haven't read is so stupid, guess that's gops new standard
it will not take years. The outrage will happen as soon as details come to light. Determined people will ensure that.

I would not vote for a "Mystery Box either; esp. if intuition told me the #HealthcareBill Mystery Box contained a stinking turd . Bad Deal.
Think of it as US Population Control.
Senator Franken, I really wish you would run for President of the United States.

I agree Shazz. It's do or die
#TrumpRyandeathcareact
Read this #JeffFlake and #SenJohnMcCain
He was the only GOP Senator I ever voted for.
They should be worrying about more than this vote when it comes to defending themselves in years to come.
You'd think so. But GOP/Rs are hell-bent on overthrowing democracy, counting on never being held accountable. Read their ideology #RESIST
I guess I just can't wrap my head around that.  Beyond my comprehension why they would want that.
Only sociopaths - without empathy & conscience let alone moral fiber - could. Too many politicians sold souls to heartless Neoliberalism
Thank you, Senator! You are looking out for real Americans, not the 1%. We appreciate you greatly!
That's why he's a former
Yes! So thankful that our MN Senators have a clue and an understanding of their duty. What kind of person calls a vote on an unknown bill?
#RepealAndReplaceTrump
Because you're smart enough, you're good enough,  and doggone it, SOMEONE likes you!
Help the people. He's only hellbent on a win without knowing the damage they'll inflict. Narcissism won't save his presidency
Yes voting no on debate is the smart tactic to allow more Repub victories in 2018.Debate the damn thing if you are so smart/make an argument
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain - do the right thing. #VoteNO
Senator McCain: This is one of the most important votes of your career. Do the right thing and vote NO. The history books will remember.
Reinstate the Risk Corridors that Sen Rubio took out right before the law came into effect. That will stabilize the exchanges.
The fact that the vote is going forward means people who've said they'll vote no, are telling R leadership they'll vote yes, doesn't it?
I didn't think of that 
 I really hope that you're wrong
