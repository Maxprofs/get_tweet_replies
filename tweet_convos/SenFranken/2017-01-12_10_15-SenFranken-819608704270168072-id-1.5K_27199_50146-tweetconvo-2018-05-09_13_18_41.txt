Please explain this, Al.  It's a picture of George Soros' son, Alexander, buying Democrats.
Soros is hardly the worst. You can do better. To earlier topic, LEGAL immigrants are being banned, is that why you served?
The POTUS has the authority to suspend the entry of any class of aliens.
just because he CAN does not mean he should. He is punishing people who are here to help, and HAVE helped us. How is that right?
Source please.
Um, everyone? Here's Fox News:
Dick Durbin is your "source"?  The same guy who compared US troops to Nazis?  You've got to be kidding!
you are missing the point.  LEGAL immigrants are being barred from coming to the US due to the executive order.
Thank you. The ACA saved my son's life. Keep it up sir.
ACA isn't perfect, but it was a very good start.  No one has seen the alternative - will most likely be worse for most people.
thank you.  Now tell us how we can stop all this from happening.
By calling your Senators now: 202-224-2131
been doing that and tweeting
They dont pay attention to emails or tweets. Blow up their phone lines. They cant avoid those.
I get "Voicemail full" when I call #GOP
Try again.
I do. But I'll keep on keepin on
@TheDemocrats SNL misses you.bring your mirror
Interesting, am I the only one who's insurance went through the roof this year? Not good for small biz
Expect bigger hikes w/o ACA. Rates were going up faster before it.
well it's going back up to 78% since it fail on it's own
thank you
Thanks Al! Keep givin' 'em HELL!!
@ctorm This is wonderful.  I'm still giggling
@DebHarkness ACA caused millions 2 See their premiums soar, mine 400% & then retirees dropped by Co. so no HC ins. Bad law
THANK YOU!! I am a cancer survivor;medical bills bankrupted me 1x already.  #SaveACA #preexistingconditions
And having to pay for higher insurance because of Obamacare nearly bankrupted us and millions of others
Haha no, but thanks for calling me a fool! Appreciate it, but no premiums sparked after "ACA"
Says the liberal
Got any explanation to the American people what exactly is motivating the GOP to harm their constituents?
$$$$  that's about it
ACA incl a hefty tax on the top tax bracket to subsidize the premiums.  This is about 1%ers
that would have been a lot funnier if talking about HRC mattered in the slightest.
make Trump jokes, snowflake.
Thank you for shouting over that #GOPbastard & speaking out for US #TheResistance #Resist #WeDoNotKneel
@ericdayton  Because what the Demacrats inacted is so terrific? http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/10/21/dayton-affordable-care-act-obamacare/ … #RepealAndReplace  ur own Dad said it.
@ericdayton you vote no on anything that will help my country. We won!!! You lost!!! Get over yourself, no community organizer!
thank you Senator Frankenstein!
They had eight years to come up with an alternative. They have to own whatever happens & hopefully voters pay attn
That's what I keep thinking. They've been trying to kill ACA for years yet in all that time...
@tyillc Will have to pass it before we find out what is on that blank page.
Why do I vaguely remember the House Majority leader saying this before ObamaCare originally passed?
why do get a sneaking suspicion you have no idea of the full quote or the context
It was 8 years ago. Don't care.
you didn't care 8 years ago, and you'll continue to be wrong until you do.
Was there not one @GOP in Congress who thought beyond "Hey let's repeal the black president's healthcare plan"? 
#ACA #Obamacare
Al Franken places his brain scan on twitter.

The ACA is a disaster. Yay everyone has health insurance. None of them can afford the premiums or deductibles but hey, wth.
you should go back to SNL. Your beloved ACA put me $6K in debt and is forcing me to file Ch7. You're exempt so don't preach

you are a poor excuse for a senator. Bully-
I live in Minnesota, and I cannot afford health insurance. Come up with something better, or get out of the way.
is no one considering HR 676 cosponsored by #JohnYarmuth https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/676 …
better than Obamacare
really? I'm surprised!!!!
@queenbloggy #MendDontEndACA
.@SenFranken @indivisibletx30
Thank you Senator Franken for voting to save the ACA and save lives.
@dst6n01 I wish they all had your guts and your character, Sen. Franken! You're a hero....
I have idea on how to address the high premiums and deductibles which is what most folks are upset about. How do I get them to u
0487
thank you for the hysterically funny interlude in this ongoing seeming nightmare. Happy to retweet!
@OccupyDemocrats 
Thank YOU!!!!
you are my great hope for politicians in Washington. I really feel like u are one of the only ones that have a brain in congress
Thanks, Al!
Did you read the ENTIRE ACA before you voted on it and Obama signed it into law?? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say, NO!
Stack a few of those in blank folders and you get a Trump dossier!
@Hudson_Photo Keep fighting for us!
this is actually the GOP plan.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/01/13/health/obamacare-doctors-opinions-aca/index.html?client=safari …
Wow, didn't see that coming...
Thank you for your dedication and your no vote.
If it weren't so true, it'd be laughable.
@AlimiBallard thank you
thank you!!!!
Stand back and let the adults work to find real solutions.  Not a Gov controlled mess but a market based solution. @jjauthor
Your party lost the Presidency, both houses in most states, including MN & most governors seats. #ACA was the main reason fool!
The replacement will not be blank but it sure as hell won't be >2,000 pages long & a need to pass before seeing what's in it.
You got into office on a ? Victory & made the deciding vote for this failed program. Sit back & watch it be repealed.
@Democrats It's a pity the Democrats are unable to be honest. They've been blocking Republican solutions to ACA for 8 yrs.
Thank you
Thank You.

These guys want zero government except for subsidies.
You supported S510, making it illegal to grow our own food, so you have no credibility, Senator.  http://www.naturalnews.com/030577_Senate_Bill_510_voting_record.html …
remember Feinstein saying we wouldn't know what was in the ACA until it passed, should have read it 1st, wouldnt have to fix now
@djackson18283 Sen Franken you remember regarding ACA https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&hl=en-us&ei=lWB6WK_xKpjKjwOb96CoCA&q=pass+the+bill+to+see+what%27s+in+it&oq=oass+the+bill+&gs_l=mobile-gws-serp.1.3.0i13k1l5.234187.239050.0.242603.15.15.0.1.1.0.474.3599.0j8j4j1j2.15.0....0...1.1.64.mobile-gws-serp..0.15.3173.1..0j41j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i10k1.fIsviB3_DQc … A blank stare or saying nothing better than that.
@wtfnewsamerica your irrelevant mr. Smalley!  You democrats are in a tailspin and its awesome to behold!
#EndOfTheDemocratParty
this is the height of hypocrisy. haters and sore loser crybullies. Trump is YOUR president babydolls so eat it.
Thank you Sen. Franken, thank you so much.
Thank you, Senator Franken, for having our best interest in mind. You are much appreciated in these days of insanity.
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@NekoCase Thank you Senator Franken.
its simple logic...dont repeal if replacement isn't ready to go..sigh...maybe its me is it me? lol
don't say citizens who lost healthcare under ACA; now pay taxes 4 having ins. Y would u want govt over healthcare. Can u say VA
tell me why we should mandate this again? Which ammendment says I pay for my neighbors health care again?
@JanoBallesteros thank you!
Thank you@SenFranken
Robbing healthcare access from the middle-class to benefit the poor is wrong.  Working full time should benefit, not punish.
Thank you
Thank you!! #StayVigilant #SaveHealthcare
wow, you're not funny and you're a terrible politician. How's your barista skills?
No, they still have their original plan, ca. 2009:
1. Don't get sick
2. But if you do, die quickly
Thank you for caring about the American people!
thank you
since the ACA was such a joke I always figured you wrote it
fake? He was elected by a majority of the ppl in his state. Tell me, did Trump get a majority of the votes?
@tsaoko_6 thank you sir
Stay Strong! Thank you #TrumpIsPutinsPuppet #PressDoYourJob #TrumpIsAConman #RepublicansCondemnThousandsToDeath
THANK YOU @SenFranken !!!
you should've stuck with SNL....they're no longer funny and you still are!
Explain to me how it's not grounds for dismissal for government assholes to vote yes to a plan they haven't seen?
Thanks for voting 'no', sir. GOP prefers going backwards as opposed to forwards. Silly primitive alpha male pride.
We found a page with a little bit of information:
Went looking for the Republican healthcare plan on @SpeakerRyan's website. Took some searching, but here it is: 
you are an fidiot
More people lost insurance due to this monstrosity than will lose it now, but no one cares about the middle class and working poor
I thought this was the list of compromises Obama and Dems made in 2008 to work with GOP to pass Obamacrap initially.
also, all of the alternative plans the Republicans have come up with in six years.
@TheDemocrats # How cruel to take away millions of Americans health insurance away and have nothing to replace it with...
@alleecoyle - It's hard to believe that after 2 yrs of planning to repeal Obamacare, there is no substantive plan to replace it.
who cares what you did
@Glock35Gal Get 'em Franken.
That does it...my tweet of the day...possibly the week and in the running for the year.
You're my hero and a brave patriot.
Would you ever consider moving to CA? We need you here.
@TheDemocrats Yeah,how about we give them that plan for themselves.
you're not and haven't been for some time.
Thank you!
@ShontelleP_C a blank page would be a huge improvement.
for who?? ACA was good enough for now until we can get universal healthcare
no, no, and no!
opinions are like hearts everyone has one
....let me rephrase everyone should have a heart that not everyone does
Dimwitted, dogmatic and now simply a liar, huh Franken?
ACA:  NEVER have so many been so screwed to help so few ... and then it imploded.  Great work Senator.  # thanksobama
Thank you for standing up for #US in the middle. Poor have #medicaid. Old have #medicare.   We middle have to have #Obamacare.
Tell Cory Booker to f--- off! Pharma pimp who supports profits for the drug industry. Watch him vote for repeal. Poser
@clairecmc @SenFranken @SenatorDurbin loved how each Democrate stated WHY they were a NO!  Shaking it up, fighting for us & making us PROUD.
@PreexistingOrg Thank you for the vote, as well as your tough questions for Jeff Sessions this week.
@Montgomery_bjm Thanks, to bad they get to continue on anyway.
@DrAlParsons Hang with us, Al. Stand strong.
Sir, respectfully, you are an ignoramus.  Thoughtful people will develope a solution to the mess U made w ACA & it will B yuuuge
any way you can bring up Treason charges against Trump McConnell Ryan and I'm sure you know a few more.I have no trust in voting
thank you. Without ACA, I can't afford $1k-$2k a month on my not optional medicines in order to live  as a type 1 diabetic
@StopNuclearWar proud to be a Minnesotan
amazingly similar to the conception of ACA.
Well said sir but could you say  it a little more often an LOUDER
go to http://pre-existing.org . Tell your representative to sign and take the pledge they are keeping your interests at heart.
thank you.  Keep fighting!
@kumailn please senator Franken, you're our only hope.
Just so i'm clear...how did you sleep at night prior to 2009?  Where was your plan, partner?  *page intentionally left blank*
thank you.
@yashi_shiroma this is truly ugly politics. Congress should abide by the repeal and vote to cut their healthcare. fng Hypocrites
Who knew that a background in comedy writing could be so valuable to being an effective senator?  Well done, Al.
love you Al!
@kumailn People were pissed when the website didn't work, what will happen w no plan at all to work, let alone a website
@mateosfo As @benteller said they want to replace Obamacare w/ wedon'tcare! If they were forced to use it, it might b different.
Thank you, Senator Franken. Please keep up the fight for Minnesotans and all Americans.
Maybe this is finally the @SenFranken decade.
Doggone it.
 @kumailn 
[Thanks, and keep doing good work!]
Thank you!
@robneyer You should vote no on every HC plan the GOP proposes. Don't participate in Trumpism.
@maybellinecat Thank you!
@MikeOkuda what a surprise!
@robneyer you're a funny man Senator. Maybe you should go back to the stage But you weren't funny there either so you gave it up
You're a liar
@kumailn hope to see Al in 2020.
thank you. My job won't give me Benefits until I've been there for 6 months. I need ACA to see the doc.
Thank You! My mom had insurance for the first time ever because of the AHA.

The @GOP are nuts.
Their plan is what we had before The ACA! Lifetime caps, pre-existing conditions, women paying more and people dying for lack of insurance!
looks like what was stuffed in those folders at Wednesday's press conference
blank for six years and counting! Thnx for your No vote
@Cravanicus uh oh
Thank you, my senator.
@TamelaD Can't both parties ever get along?  For Americans sake?
Trump and his republican attack dogs can even buy some Democrats. You have seen it. It's the bread, Fred and they want more.
@catiyas  Thank you Senator Franklin. #theRESISTANCE
Funny, like a clown
That’s GOPee, Al
So apparent to you then why not the DNC? DNC, with knowledge aforethought, purposely put our country in danger running Clinton.
@MissyMMilton thanks for doing what my Arkansas Senators don't want to do for us. Ours don't understand or don't care it seems.
Thank you & all the other Democrats who did this. Are there problems w the ACA? Yes. But @POTUS def moved the needle necessarily
@18DianneM You nailed-it, Sen.  Stay vigilant. 
"Hate is not a plan." -HRC
....and this is what most working people have left after paying these ridiculous "affordable" care act premiums: $0.00 @SenFranken
...we took you more seriously when you were on "Saturday Night Live" @SenFranken
7 years later and these fools can't come up with anything!  America, you got duped by a con man!
-- @realDonaldTrump  This means YOU!  It will be YOUR job to DEMAND a better REPLACEMENT!
thanks, Senator. You make me a proud Minnesotan.
Thank you!
thank you Senator Franken!  I wish you were my Senator..  Keep fighting for us!
THANK YOU SENATOR AL FRANKEN FOR STANDING UP FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!
THANK YOU!!
just remember how great it really is when you all exempt yourselves from it...make laws you have to follow too!!
Thank you. This is why Minnesota loves you!
probably in a pile with other replacement bills on Harry Reid's old desk
thank you for your service.  Please keep up the fight.
@kathi1_va Thank You Sir.. it won't be forgotten 
I love you. That's pretty much it.
there are like fifteen competing plans to replace the #ACA! Granted they're all dumb ones, but still they exist.
Thank you.
