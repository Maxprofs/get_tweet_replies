We can't. This was disqualifying. Senate must vote against confirming De Vos- totally unqualified
Are you getting pay to attack her?  She is very qualified and will do a great job!
Wait is that paid protestor thing something you folks actually believe? Also: what are her qualifications?
Google it do your home work
I have. It's why I know she has no qualifications for the role.
Lair
What does a hiding place for wild animals have to do with the nominee for Secretary of Education?
Make sure to vote NO on her nomination . #Dems have been part of unanimous approvals! Disrupt the process! #Unqualified
@SmartLiberal @usedgov somebody get her an education!
Franken-Duckworth 2020
Betsy DeVos is grossly unqualified. Her ideas are dangerous. She must be disqualified.
@sassyemmy3 @SenFranken #DumpDevos
Go Al!
@Alt_DeptofED My 81 y.o. mom, retired elementary special ed teacher who's not on social media, says thank you and keep going!
god bless al franken
Should at least be able to pass an entry-level teacher interview.
@SenFranken @ms73 @usedgov
Bet she didn't think preparation was necessary. #Trump #nominees prob used to $ buying what they want.
Probably?!?
I couldn't abbreviate 'allegedly' as well.
lol
@GrandmaWat @usedgov Al, you should run for president. Honestly. I would follow you into battle.
@AFSCME @usedgov Dems in the Senate must stand up and fight!! Most dangerous president ever. Save Our Democracy
thank you for standing up and asking important questions.
get a life AL, proven private schools excell over public, that is what our taxes should support!
@kmt188 Wow

I love you Mr franken
@SenateDems @SenStabenow @SenGaryPeters 

NO ON DeVOS
You Democrats better get your shit together Al, u looked like a stuttering clown on Maddow. Obstruct all things Trump or ur out. All of you.
Make DeVos take the SAT!
they all laughed at you (democrats,the public). How did that make you feel. did you have to look in the mirror....
@slak909 @usedgov She is beyond far the worst candidate ever nominated! #NotoDeVos #DumpDevos
this woman should not be allowed within 10 yards of our kids!
 Dumb Trump and friends
to build up your self esteem? I don't mind you being part of the @usedgov. Just remember what it felt like getting ther
Mr. Franken, you were a comedian and when you went for the Sen. seat nobody thought you were serious...
Thank goodness for you Sen Franken!
guns in school should only be provided by a police screened princable. 
thank you for standing up for education.
Maybe because it's not the Fed's job to lead our nation's schools.  Less bureaucracy and more parenting is needed.
@shesgotgame16 @usedgov An educator of 13 yrs. #concerned #salariesarebasedpartlyonthisissue
So glad you're my Senator - thank you!
Did you guys drug tested her before she got seated? She seems to be kinda imbalance if you catch my drift.
you did an excellent job trying to get a morsel of truth out of her!!
Thank ypu Senator Franken!!
Thank you for speaking up for students!  DeVos is not right for SOE-doesnt support public ed.
She is a FRAUD!
Brilliant Mr Franken.  Be ready for 2020!
@AidaGray13 @usedgov @SenWarren  Your questioning has been very well done. Thank you!
Then please stand with us and vote NO on her, Tillerson & Price especially. Stand with the majority. You have the power
thank you!Please vote no and convince the rest of the committee that a NO is in order.
THANK YOU!! 
Bless you, Sen. Franken
Nice to see you pop your head out of the hole you've been in the last 8 years.Could have used you earlier.
I think @SenFranken should think about running for President in 2020.
@honk4peace @usedgov Are we going to let her indoctrinate our children in federally funded religious schools? WTF!!!
@honk4peace @usedgov Isn't anyone concerned about her extremist religious views and desire for a Christian theocracy? 1st Amend?
@honk4peace @usedgov "So, our desire is to confront the culture in ways that will continue to advance God’s Kingdom" B. Devos
thank you for caring for all Americans and their need for quality public education #noDevos
This woman has no clue..again ..could not buy a clue from Vanna White!! Vote her out!!! Rich crazy woman who tosses $$$
Congress... don't buy into "No appointment left behind" sometimes it's good to say "no"
Jesus needs to come and personally slap this woman.
we can't she's a simpleton fanatic that wants the world to think like her. No thanks.
@Moomerizer she's not fit to run any thing especially education I heard she doesn't believe in special ed I have an autistic son
@CariONeil3 @usedgov Please, Senator, protect our schools and our children. That woman is nothing more than a proselytizer.
Wants to lead education but can't understand the question. Well...
@LeslieMarshall @usedgov I'm a teacher in public schools & we do need parental involvement. Best way to empower them is w/check
Any hope of aisle-crossers blocking her? Can your committee vote her down? Do you have the votes?
Will you be at the March in St. Paul on Saturday? I think it's important for our Senators to be there.
she's like trump never really even had a job...just muscle of money
DeVos  should just keep playing in the sandbox, but make sure the pail & shovel are edible & have rounds edges!
never liked you but you are right on with #trump cabinet noms questions
.@SenFranken @usedgov Agree!
This would be funny if it where not so very sad. Thanks Sen. Franken great job on questions of all nominees!!
@LeslieMarshall @usedgov Too bad there isn't a grade lower than an F because this was terrible. She bought her seat @ the table
Many idiots think she got an "F" for that's FINE with me!!
now doggone it, people just don't like you, Al.
becuase the Rep don't care, it's all a horse and pony show for them. We all are going to lose in the end x4yrs
@maschem67 @usedgov Agreed. Federal involvement in education needs a rehaul, but this woman would be a disaster.
@lizzzzz_c @usedgov I have some friends who are head of our PTO Who can tutor her on some of this stuff.
We can't.
Thank you sir!
It's like putting the Lunatic in charge of the Assylum because he has got a Mental Illness
well she can't be confirmed. Everyone saw it. If she is the process is clearly theatrical and a waste of time & money
@BetsyDeVos refused 2 answer questions as if she was in a Senate hearing based on her companies & corruption practices
#potentialgrizzlies she or her family never attended pub school never needed student loans. How can she know anything?
Did I miss your announcement of your 2020 Presidential run yesterday? Please run.
best for the job? or his best donors?
@Rand0mpers0n235 @usedgov time to ask GOP senators same question. Has to be some that see how poor of choice she is. (Please?)
Thank you for fighting for our children! You're more awesome now than ever!! #TheResistance #TrumpLeaks
All trumps nominees are square pigs in round holes.
Excellent questions!
there is no way that DeVos should more forward.  Our families and children deserve an actual educator. Seriously!
He revealed her ignorance on just this matter which is tip of the iceburg of her ignorance!
Ut must b stopped! This is the billionaires grab at the education funds. They plan to steal us blind
Thank yoiu Al Franken for proving  this woman is an utter fraud.
HALT INAUGURATION INDEFINITELY... trump & ALL HIS TROLLS ARE ILLEGITIMATE.   CUT THE BS & ACT NOW!!  ENUF IS ENUF
@TheTeditorial and guns to protect schools from grizzlies.  Fails to understand that IDEA is a fed law. Glad I'm done w/teaching
good good good
@Limeylizzie @usedgov Luv ya Al. You're the best!
@LiberalJaxx @usedgov Expose these shallow, incompetent twits. Nice job! #TrumpSwamp #ShitShow #AssClowns
@EndorMoonTeam @usedgov  
please watch this video#NOdevos 
https://www.facebook.com/AFTunion/videos/10154534444179160/ …
thank you @SenFranken for your diligent good sense.
Qualified? Oh Al, you didn't get the email. It's about swamps and campaign contributions now....silly, silly Senator
@camille223 @usedgov 

Yeah! Choice is only for killing babies!  Not education!
That tart is a clown. Glad you are on our side! The good guys must unite and give the Russkies and Donnie hell!
I love you Al @SenFranken
@MMASOCCERFAN @usedgov Slay
We can't have an unqualified person as sec of Ed. Thank you for your questions
@kattjenny1 @usedgov hope she isn't teaching.
Her lack of knowledge re: laws and process for students with disabilities is disappointing- clearly unqualified. Vote no.
@incognito_4747 @usedgov
#AlFranken2020 #saynotodevos #NoToVouchers #YesToALLEducation4ALL @realDonaldTrump #OurKidsMatter
Al, thanks for sticking it to Devos. Keep up the good work and enjoy our 2nd song.
@TheBriefTruth @usedgov as a teacher, I feel that Mrs. DeVos isn't qualified for this job. It's quite obvious she hasn't a clue.
Thank you for standing up for our children, @SenFranken
thank you Sen.Franken-- your reply about being a minute over was PERFECTION.
U asked the most basic questions She knew nothing and smiled like this was all perfunctory Please dont let be A+ for u
excellent job! Keep it up. Education is our highest priority
@Ddebn8R @usedgov thank you for standing up for our country!
@doodlebug0 @usedgov It would b funny if it wasn't so sad.
I'd have given her a few points for homework but it's clear she hasn't done any. Disgraceful.
Thank you for sticking with it Senator, and for having a live person answer the phone when I called today!
Thank you for trying to protect our children
@Dina_Tan73 @usedgov God bless you, Mr. Franken.
@drgaiainc @usedgov Thank you. Educators dedicate lives to serving ctry's children.To treat us so poorly.Disgraceful.
@GBankin @usedgov Did she really think she could just wing it?
Please Al, STOP her.  My son has autism, and our special needs kids can't afford her in charge.  MN mom here
@adnildyob @usedgov BetsyD is proof private schools fail at education.
solve this Betsy and u can be SOE ...Domain of f (x)=x/(x^2-1)
Please DON'T confirm this person. She admitted she won't hold private schools accountable.
Best question, I've ever heard a senator ask a nominated secretary of education. Inspiring. Thanks.
Thanks for caring about our future.
Come on Rs even though you will never admit it your r ashamed of this train wreck. In deep dark places you r saying WTF
Thank you for your work, too bad she will still get appointed, like all the rest. 
We don't expect she'll will. I'm a retired teacher of 32 years and this woman does not know education.
The GOP want to keep us stupid & subservient by teaching creationism & weakening our public schools. #Resist
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Speaking as an advocate for children,they deserve better.
@TSal58 @usedgov the Republican agenda of eliminating government is being manifest via Trump cabinet. P Ryan's smirk is constant
very unfortunate your questions were blocked please keep trying more politicians like you would drain the swamp
I just learned kids do not have spelling errors corrected anymore bc they r worried about self esteem of bad spellers.
much better than anybody you would want in that position
This woman cannot be responsible for the ppl who will take care of us in our old age. Equal, free education for all!
oh and deny Sessions and tillerson as well
plz deny her confirmation. I have never been more opposed to any one in my life, except trump of course
@Truman206 @usedgov
Woohoo! Git her, al! She has no business being ed sec. Plz dont approve her. I emplore u. Kids r our future.
Thanks for your leadership! You only need to pay attention for 15 minutes to know difference b/w growth and proficiency! #DeVosHearings SAD!
Keep fighting Senator Franken!  We appreciate it.
loved your Q/A. Get her GONE! !
@AnOldLefty @usedgov love you Al you are amazing
She obviously has no idea what she is doing. I don't want her anywhere near America's children.
@riotwomennn @usedgov Thank you for fighting Al.
@mary_mary5653 @usedgov if we start privatization, we will walk back to segregation and call it progress.
@riotwomennn @usedgov our children are counting on you,There future is in our hands. Thank you Sen. Al Franken.

In life we have to choose our battles, As a parent, I thank you for choosing this battle
@jandroid @usedgov 
#Education #miched
She gets an F in a red bold letter. She doesn't have a clue of the demand that would occur under her inept leadership.
@Mtbkgrl @usedgov she's a voucher supporter and they don't work. No approval for her.
Can someone else get nominated? She doesn't seem to know much.
Betsy Devos is #notqualified
thank you for your service
But this ok! Her housemaid's childrens went to public school, so she must be qualified!
@talace @usedgov 

Let's hope they continue to hold her to account in the way he did. 

Expose the swamp!
Thank you.
@MikeFitzburg @usedgov  Thank you for doing your job.  Wish someone would ask her if her brother is part of transition team?
DaVos - big name on the westside of Michigan. DJT must need to return a favor. As a mother to pre-schoolers PLEASE appt a qualified person!
Great job, Franken.
ha! Ask her about IEPs , 504s, ELL, DDMs, SSPs... does she know what any of the basic lingo means?
Can't.
Some may be more familiar with the terms Criterion-Referenced vs Norm-Referenced in testing. Doubt DeVos knows either.
Thank you!
Can't you look beyond her words and into her heart? She's rich,loves  children,wishes the best for all. Isn't it enuf?
. @SenFranken @usedgov Thank you, Senator Franken!
Even more shocking than #BetsyDeVos is the scum trying to vet her.
such a frightening thing for the American people to witness! We must do better than this!
This is very troubling. Thank you for asking these questions.
2020?!
. @SenFranken sincere thanks for your work on these confirmation hearings.  You are the absolute model for a legislator and public servant.
@disgust_d @usedgov We cannot trust her! She will also blur the separation of church & state-bad for the future of this country!
Senator Franken, your alter ego approves. #TheResistance
.@AynRandPaulRyan @SenFranken @usedgov Unfortunately she is in possession of the big bucks and able to play in "his" pay for play
y r doing an excellent job, Al!  Bar the cabinet idiocracy #resist save our country from lunacy corruption thievery
#neverBetsy does not know zip about education. Throw her to her grissley bears #resist
@realDonaldTrump tRump do you understand the difference? If so, withdraw DeVos.
DeVos clearly cannot be trusted to enforce ADA, IDEA, Title IX, civil rights. How can we trust her with our children?
Keep up the great work you do for us. Proud to have two great Senators in Minnesota.
, Thank you from NY state public school and college families, administrators, staff, and teachers! cc @usedgov
Thank you so much for showing the world what people already know about her in Michigan! Excellent job!
great job by Al Franken.
@kbeninato @usedgov You can expect the whole crew to try to prove democracy leads to chaos, and is obsolete.
She's like but I'm loaded and no one every questions me. Hahaha good job pointing out how clueless she is? Pay2Play
Thank you for all the hard work you're doing!

Too bad you can't do a damn thing to stop her, LOL. Thanks Harry Reid!
