You only add to the hate & discord in this family called #America You should be ashamed!
Well here's the #truth #Trump won. #JeffSessions WILL be approved. YOU can do NOTHING about it either.  #ItsOver
.@USAObserver @CrociKaren  But we can do something about it, and @SenFranken is. We will continue to oppose and stand strong #TheResistance
 <<<<<...is doing nothing but obstructing, creating division & pissing off the #American people.
Delusional. Obstructionists. But know, that #America is NOT on your side. Done here.
It's a shame that the Committee Chair and Senator Cornyn have NO integrity. Thank you, Senator.
You voted against #JeffSessions because you're hateful mean nasty person. Period!
You need to go back to SNL. You're a mockery of the United States Senate.
Franken was only funny for one skit on SNL, when you were that stupid satellite backpack! Then it was over. 
thank you Sen. Franken. We need more like you. Ur good, ur strong, we like u! 
I do believe @SenFranken is an American Hero @NormOrnstein @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZkwUKY4cc â€¦ #NoSessions

-Gotsuch is well-qualified, even if right wing. Likely to be confirmed.  Offer Dem support in exchange for DTs tax returns.
Thank you for your Resistance Senator.
@KevinDarryl Just a few blocks from where #MichaelDonald was lynched this a.m.  #Justice  #Sessions
You're my Mr. Douglas in Hooterville. Well done, sir.
@JudiciaryDems @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary @YouTube  Can we sue the President for lying? This is ridiculous and dangerous
They boycotted 10 mths for NEW President. We'll boycott 'til the new guy gets ETHICAL. #NOT1DEMVOTE #BecauseEthics
Thank you so much, Senator, for resisting the authoritarian takeover of America.
.@senjudiciary Great job @SenFranken we need to see more of this outrage. You cannot submit to an evil agenda, it never gets you anywhere!

Sessions also one of the architects of Week 1 madness & EOs. AND, may be involved in Russian espionage via Carter Page

Thank You!
PROUD to be represented by SENATOR AL FRANKEN! Now THIS IS WHAT INTEGRITY LOOKS LIKE!!!!
and Lynch met with Bill on the tarmac and sent no help to Chicago. Stellar. Really.

Thank,you Sen Franken for trying!
It wasn't a "speech" Stewart Smalley, it was a whine fest. You're pathetic.
We urge Mr. McConnell & Mr.Paul to follow your lead & get onboard. Peace TY. @SenFranken @KatCapps @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary @YouTube
Your terrible judgement as a super delegate caused this. Step aside.
Of course you voted against J Sessions. I expect nothing less from YOU "PEOPLE".
Thank you for standing up to tyranny as best a minority can.
I did...Thank you...
YOU WERE HONEST, TRUTHFUL & APPROPRIATE FOR CALLING OUT THE FACTS. Thank You!
Thank you @SenFranken for the consistency you have shown throughout @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary
I did.  It reminded me of the Jerry Seinfeld show.
thank you Sen. Franken
and a great speech it was, thx
If you didn't nestle up to corporate interests & stood w/ Bernie we wouldn't be in this mess
Thank you, @SenFranken! I listened to your every word - you are a treasure!
I feel Franken wasted his time focusing on Cruz.
Thank you for voting against Sessions!
don't ever back down Senator! We are counting on you. Now more than ever. Thank you! Must #BlockGorsuch
.@SenFranken Thank you for your detailed views. Your points were excellent and brings to light the fact that he will not act as an AG should
you need to stop being hateful and do the job you are being paid for. You will voted out
You were a true Democratic Hero today. Thank you for exposing Lyin' Ted Cruz & Sessions for who they really are
Says the Clown who's nothing more than a Comedian & A BAD one at that 2018 is OURS

One Hell of a job! Thank you, Senator!

@zayntill @SenatorSessions @senjudiciary @YouTube Thank you!
Good work, Al. Even the President calls him Lyin' Ted Cruz.  Misrepresentin' Ted is pretty courteous.  #decorum

: Franken: After your 40-min. rpt--AM, I heard all--more discriminatory than any.  YOU?!
