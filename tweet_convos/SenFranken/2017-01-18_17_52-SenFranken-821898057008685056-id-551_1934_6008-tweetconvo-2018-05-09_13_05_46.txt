Thank you, Senator. You have done an outstanding job questioning these nominees.
you can thank #HarryReid for the reason you're vote won't matter #NuclearOption coming home to roost. LOL
True. Are you glad that the R's are going to approve so many inexperienced, unqualified Cabinet members? 
I believe most of these cabinet picks to be significantly more qualified than previous administration picks
Really? Which ones? Devos for Ed? Carson for HUD? Perry for Energy? Zinke for Interior? Pruitt for EPA? How so? 
@MooksInsight @SenFranken
if everyone would just stop demonizing Trump & cabinet picks before anyone has a chance to prove you wrong/fight
Would you hire someone without experience to oversee a bureaucracy of 1000's w/ a budget in the 100's of millions?
that's exactly what we got with Obama and somehow the left thinks he was a great President LOL
Please consider a run in 2020.
Yes please do, Stuart Smally is Sure to get elected, please please please please please run
Thank you!!
You are unqualified for the job that you hold and certainly not qualified to judge Betsy DeVos.
you were quoted by @washingtonpost  https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/01/27/sen-franken-no-democrat-will-vote-for-betsy-devos-as-education-secretary-and-were-seeking-republicans-to-oppose-her/ …
This Minnesota educator thanks you!
I agree I agree I agree... please make this your plight
Follow up with Bob Corker, R-TN. Lamar appears to be a dead end, given refusal for 2nd hearing. Corker may swing.
THANK YOU!
Thank you!
It's not even about politics. She's just not qualified. #grizzlybears
Stuart Smiley isn't qualified to be a US senator.
I disagree. He's good enough, he's smart enough, and doggone it, I like him.
He's a bad actor and cheated to win.
You got Trump, just stop while you're ahead. 
Can't stand Trump.  Old Stuart is worse.
Thank you, Senator. She's completely unqualified and an extreme danger to our education system.
totally agree
@doctorow - Now "crystal clear" or "undeniably clear." It's always been "clear" she's unqualified. Who claimed to the contrary?
As a teacher, I thank you.
do not vote for this unqualified individual who does not have our public schools or children in her best interest.
Thank you!!!
Always a champion of the most important causes and http://issues.You 're funny, but we're born to be where you are now. Respect
@emmatayl @usedgov PLEASE don't tell us, tell the GOP senators, there must be 3 willing to put our children above party. PLEASE!
.  I APPRECIATE YOU, SENATOR!!!! GRACIAS!!  #releasetrumptaxes #participationispower
i take you serious. Like a hemorrhoid, a cancer sore, or any other pustule. 2/2
as clear as the first count in your election, or the last one? as clear as that diaper from your old SNL gags? 1/2
You were a comedian on SNL so how were you qualified to be a Senator?
Whats clear is U people need to not support every single spew the GOP put up. Ben Carson included. Fight everything
@JackieC1989 @usedgov Thank you senator. I don't care for any of his appointees but she scares me most because of long term.
she is not qualified. As an educator this deeply concerns me.
You sent your kids to PRIVATE school you hypocrite.
Thank you Senator Franken! Our children deserve so much better.
Which Republican senators should we call that might be swayed to vote NO-on Betsy DeVos?
I applauded your questioning of Ms DeVos during the hearings.  Its good to know there are still good men on the hill.
You certainly know about not being qualified for a job.
- Thank you for not giving this woman your vote!  She is NOT qualified to run this important department.
thank you for all you do Senator Franken.
thank you Senator Franken!!  Education is so important (clearly) and demanding responsible leadership is essential.
Thank you!
Thank you! Please be sure to #VoteNo on ALL OTHER nominations. make sure you tell everyone in the @SenateDems also!
thank you!
please oppose this unqualified nominee
@BetsyDeVos thank you Sen Franken for voting NO on DeVos!
Thank you, Senator Franken, for taking a stand for quality education for all.
find a way to filibuster all these fools. Please.

thank you for understanding there needs to be a base skill level for the job. #grizzlies
@AdrianColbert1 this is not your business, you are not American!
Thank you! Please fight for us Americans & keep grilling those billionaires that have no clue!
Thank you.
Thanks Al! It is a travesty that she was nominated in the first place. I have a disable child and fear this administration.
it's clear that your comment about teachers ignoring high and low achievers makes you unqualified too.
thank you for your level headedness. She's completely unqualified
Thank you Senator!
Thank you!
@ASedlander @usedgov
Thank you Senator!
I beg for all to vote against this unfit woman.  Thank you!
why are you participating in hearings when SCOTUS hearing is still languishing??? #demochump
Make Sure #Booker & the other swine have a front row seat. #CORRUPTION #PurgeTheDems #NeoLibs #NeoCons. #OnlyTulsi
Funny from a guy whose main qualification for the Senate is his previous experience as cocaine dealer.
thank you! She isn't qualified at all, my opinion as a retired educator of 38 years
It's also clear that you aren't qualified to be a Senator, yet there you are. So your point is negated.
https://www.facebook.com/AFTunion/videos/10154534444179160/ …
@KaooavopaKatapa @usedgov     Thank you Senator Franken for this.   She certainly is not qualified. 
Why not filibuster the confirmation hearing as Stuart Smalley?
Thank you for your clear thinking and strong stand! #mnlovesfranken
Thank you for your thorough and intelligent questioning of these dreadful nominees, and for calling out  @SenAlexander on his BS
Good for you, Senator. You have turned out to be a bright light on the Hill.
Thank you for working for all of us, Senator! We appreciate you.
Thank you, Senator.   My son, who is disabled, fears Trump.  I try to keep him calm.  I pray to keep him safe.
finally a person with character
She's not qualified to find her asshole with both hands and a dog. Neither is Trump the Clown.
Its also "clear" MN shouldn't have sent little Stewart to Washington. She doesn't need your vote anyway  #irrelevant
THANK YOU!
@WarAgainstWomen @usedgov  Thank you, Sir!
@GravityDynamic @usedgov 
THANK YOU!!! From the heart of an educator.. THANK YOU
@cmiche1 @usedgov THANK YOU!!  Good work today. Keep it up! 
@cdelbrocco @usedgov As a college chemistry student I recall laughing at the snake oil that Amway bottled and sold. Like Trump.
@relombardo3 @usedgov 
Dems better stop taking big $ from Rx, big oil etc. If not, they're new Whig party, in dustbin of history
She's good enough, she's smart enough, and dog gone it, people like her. Fucking get over over it AL!
thank you
Who cares?  You're a circus clown.
@UniteBlue cruella de vos
@UniteBlue @usedgov Appalled by her lack of knowledge. Thank you for the adept questioning which helped expose her incompetence
Thank you Senator.  Her hearing was embarrassing. Proving once again that money does not in all cases,  buy Logic.
Get this, village idiot Franken tries 2 lecture an expert in education & she slaps him down,Al should keep his yap shut
thank you.
@LindaCrowNEA @usedgov Please share the additional questions posed and her responses. She risks our future...our children.
@mariecorfield @usedgov Thank you, Senator.
@UniteBlue @usedgov if she clears the bar, there is no bar. Pack up and go home - the show is meaningless.
@UniteBlue @usedgov my cat is more qualified.
@UniteBlue @usedgov @Morning_Joe See, some politicians actually care about our KIDS winning bigly!
And in other shocking news the sun will rise in the east tomorrow. @ClaraListenspre @usedgov
@UniteBlue @usedgov thank you sir It is blatantly clear she did nothing to prepare for the hearings
I support you for the SNOWFLAKE award! We won you lost! The American People elected President Donald J Trump! Get in line!
Gotta work on your logic there. Trump victory doesn't automatically make DeVos or any other nominee qualified.
Your questioning was spot on and helped expose this charade for what it is. Keep fighting for us.
as a retired SpEd teacher I'm horrified at her lack of knowledge! She's utterly unqualified to lead Ed Dept #NoToDeVos
Thank You! Please also consider a NO vote on Price, Tillerson & Sessions.
Thank you Senator Franken.
@Susanmills158 
Guess Who Cares,---- nobody!!!
you'll regret it when all those grizzlies attack our schools and the kids won't have AR-15s to shoot them with
@Susanmills158 @usedgov surprise,surprise,when were you "EVER "on the right side for America? Btr .on S N L ,LOSER ON FREEDOM
Its so obvious!! I hope many more are like you!!
watch the movie "The Accountant"to see what Mnuchin knows about laundering money.He was the producer.
@usedgov
THANK YOU!!!
@BetsyDeVos totally unqualified for the job.
Thank you, Senator Franken!
Gee, didn't people say the same thing about you? Once as ass, always an ass!

Thank you!
Why didn't you resign when you learn you were elected through fraud? Or is election integrity not important?
That coming from Stuart Smalley
what are the chances this woman can be blocked from confirmation?
@roseamund @usedgov thanks Al, you
.@SenFranken @usedgov You just came to that conclusion after giving her a fair hearing, eh Al? What an idiot...
It's clear that Betsy DeVos is not qualified for the job of @usedgov Sec., & I will not be supporting her nomination https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1231060996979780 …
said a shitty comedy writer who helped sink SNL quicker than the Titanic.
THANK YOU!
Luckily, your support is not needed.
it's clear that you are a partisan hack voting on party lines.  Oh, and you were never funny.
@used Gov
Progressive Democrats will NEVER accept vouchers or non-public ed ~
Unless it becomes their idea 
#LetsTalkPrinciples
OK tool, like we care.
based on your vast knowledge and personal qualifications.  uh huh.
Rule of thumb....If a liberal hates you, you're good for the country.
Not qualified? That's funny coming from a wannabe comedian & useless lump of a senator.
@PeterVecsey1 @usedgov Many think you yourself are unqualified, Senator.
I'm sorry, but as a failed washed-out comedian, exactly how much political experience did you have when you first ran?
thank you!
@BetsyDeVos  That smug smile on her face yesterday saud, " I bought this job & there's NOTHING  u can do about it!"
@BetsyDeVos  Thank u, Senator Franken for your work yesterday exposing DeVos' complete & utter ignorance.#unqualified
Thank you, Senator! Keep fighting for us.
THANK YOU Al!
You are a great senator Al Frankin. Love watching you work!
our schools need protection from ignorant people like her!
less qualified than a comedian to be a Senator?
thanks you Senator Frankenstein!
as if it was ever going to be any other way huh Stuart?
You were a freaking comedy writer. U think u were qualified for ur job? The uneducated still voted for u
Al, go take a nap
It's because she and her husband have donated money to private schools, isn't it?
Shocking! 
i suppose a would be comic would meet your qualifications for that post . huh al ?
Speaking of qualifications....
Gee, what a surprise!  As if that, along with many other votes is in question. So, curious, will she still become Sec?
since I consider you a partisan hack, your opinion has as much credibility as the former Yugoslavian auto industry.
Thank you for your courage, intelligence and eloquence. Please consider running for Pres next go around. From a MT admirer.
then please senator do not approve her.
she should have spent some time writing jokes for SNL.
Agreed. I'll go even further. If you haven't appeared on SNL or World Wide Wrestling you should never hold office in MN
Franken in 2020!
jag-off
hey doofus!  No one cares!
@bad_bad_bernie @usedgov Too bad you didnt feel that way about Hillary. Bernie would have won.
Thanks. DeVos shouldn't lead Dept of Edu my sons need for special srvc in Eden Prairie MN is on the line!
U were not qualified to be Senator, but here U R still not qualified. Look into UR mirror&pat urself on the back 4 being a dick
What experience did you have before being a senator?
Betsy DeVos not qualified? Given her track record in Detroit Terry Schievo in her last year would have been better.
Proving you are right and doing right are not one and the same. Watch full confirmation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRBNkMM0-pM …
#swampminions More interested in for-profit schools than educating kids. Typ #swamptoad appointee ala Trump U. So sad!
It's clear that you're not qualified for the job of US Senator, but there you are anyway.
We stand behind you, Sen. Franken!
You're not qualified to be a Senator, but there you are.
Says the #UnQualified washed up 'Comedian' who was elected with fraudulent ballots?
you're not qualified for your job either.
@Mr_Turek @usedgov it's a shame that a clown like you is unqualified for you position
MN had a knack for picking winners lol
Isn't it great to know......you only get an opinion.
Devos NOT QUALIFIED.  Just another BILLIONAIRE donor getting "paid back" with a nomination! Please vote NO
Thank you!
@France24_en @AlJazeera @hsmoghul @WajahatAli 
#DumpDevos Please RT, it is for the sake of our #childrenEducation!
U #DirtyDems just want 2 #ProtectTeachersUnions but u #Voted4CommonCore ur #Not4Kids #VoteFrankenOUT #EndCommonCore
LMAO this from a 2nd rate comic with no experience (who's election win has doubts) playing at being a US Senator
u r NOT qualified 2B a senator either!  U don't speak 4 #MN Time to #DTS start w/ #Franken #SNL means nothing
good thing nobody gives a rats ass what u think
It's also clear that you've joined the ranks of the political hypocrisy when you grill someone over stocks you own too
we already knew before you even said a word - that's how predictable you are
@carmen_armillas @usedgov Thank you, Senator Franken.
good job, Al.
Nobody gives a shit what you think.  We do NOT need you.
Of course, you would have said that about ANY GOP nominee.
Said the Clown.
#Franken2020
Based Franken! Franken2020!!!
Thanks, Sen. Smalley.
Why?  Serious question.  Why is she not qualified?
