Had SPAM for the 1st time in 40+ yrs. the other day. SALT, SALTY, TOO MUCH SALT and did I mention SALT?
I'm sorry, what's that? You really think it's salty? I mean, just a little salty? Or really salty? I can't quite tell by your comment.
Visiting Alaska right now and found out they have the second most consumption of Spam after Hawaii
That's good news for Austin, Minnesota. Minnesotans don't eat that.
