Thanks @SenFranken for joining us on the House floor to demand action on gun violence. #NoBillNoBreak 
thank you. We need #guncontrol.
, you have it in Chicago, Detroit, Paris. Epic failures
This crap has NOTHING to do w/"gun violence". Purely a power grab by socialist "new party" Dems. ONLY about controlling citizens
Thanks, I wish I was there
and you actually have constituents that are stupid enough to fall for that lie
@chi910 @RepBonamici @RepDanKildee We're with you! Kick ass! #NoBillNoBreak #NoFlyNoBuy #enough
@RepBonamici I'll give this one, but you were on the wrong side of history when you endorsed hrc.
if you hate gun violence then ADDRESS THE BLACK COMMUNITY!! don't SIT-IN, "GET OFF YOUR ASS!" and head to Chicago!
@RepBonamici 

Heil.

At the end stands victory.
So glad you were there. I've never been more proud of the Democrats! Please keep standing up for common sense safety measures
@WesSmith123 @RepBonamici Our undying thanks to all in tonite's #ProgressCongress
Hope U don't have 2 use the bathroom. We want the 2nd amendment protected from people like U
linda,  I want my children to be safe. You can die alone with a cat eating your cadaver. #noonewillcare
you're kid would have been happier aborted
that's what YOUR mother said but your grandpa/dad said no.
Ha! My dad would beat your dads ass
but then again you and your dad/grandad love getting bent over,  don't you.
@RepBonamici so how come dems voted down the bill that would have prev. terrorists from getting guns?
Proud to act like a pouting child? Well we have always known you have no sense.
What bill are they advocating for...?
too bad you didn't care about #riggedprimaries
@RepBonamici Thank you, stand up for our beliefs, stand up for common sense #NoBillNoBreak
@LaMinang @RepBonamici You're doing a good job.
What's with all the ISIS recruits coming from Minnesota?  @SenFranken
@RepBonamici The US senate is a circus and the monkeys are holding up the show!
@RepBonamici shut up
.@SenFranken .@RepBonamici .@SenBillNelson .@SenWarren .@ChrisMurphyCT Thank you! #HoldtheFloor You have strong support >90% #NoFlyNoBuy
@RepBonamici , how much cocaine did you do on SNL?
didnt have a sit in b4  4 all the gun crimes in chicago! hillary getting bashed by trump u needed something 2 distract i suppose
Those against restricting guns from criminals & no-fly lists are deranged enough to be placed on the list. (inc. GOP)
Please ask opponents: I can't take more than 3.4oz of YOGURT on a plane for "safety", but "no fly" guy bought assault weapons?
@RepBonamici you know, of course, the ACLU is suing to protect due process, not remove it, right?
Thank you sitting in for our country! It means a lot to see MN represented. #EnoughisEnough
You belong with the rest of the asylum denizens.  Enjoy!
Thank You!
@Ms_Wind @RepBonamici we are all behind you.  Stay strong.
@RepBonamici Thank you from Minnesota for your leadership!
@RepBonamici only a person who's former job is read and repeat with emotion could be this dumb.
wow so you actually have done something there! Well at least when the cameras are on
@RepBonamici
your good enough you're smart enough & doggone it, people like u!
@RepBonamici Keep taking tax payer money and sitting on your ass!
@elizabethavedon @RepBonamici @RepEBJ 
Thank you to your and Amy.  I proud to be a Minnesotan today.  You have our vote
Keep it up, Al!   We are ALL behind you--even your supporters out here in California!
Why don't you sit in for all of the gun violence in Chicago @SenFranken do #blacklivesmatter
THANK YOU!
@MinnesotaDFL @RepBonamici 
Are we going to organize a sit in of support here in MN ?
How about you disarm your armed security guards before telling us we can't have protection.
keep up the good work!
@RepBonamici 
If we don't stand up and together, how will there be change?
@RepBonamici why are you pushing the UN agenda of citizen disarmament rather than 2nd A rights?
making Minnesota proud, my man! Hope to see you on the range in a couple of weeks!
@RepBonamici Take extra diapers for your   friends
@RepBonamici you guys all look like dopes.
.@SenFranken Obama orders FBI ‘NOT’ to treat people associated with Islamic terrorist groups as potential threats
@RepBonamici we're with you from Arizona!! #NoFlyNoBuy #NoBillNoBreak
@DaltonRoad 
DEMS CHANT on HOUSE FLOOR:
What do we want to END ?  DUE PROCESS
When do we end it?  NOW!
i can sit on the floor and play with my phone for hours too
@RepBonamici and not a single thought given to root cause, critical view on data, constitution or Supreme Court judgements
Thank you for sitting up for these needed bills.  I wish that you represented me instead of that coward Tillis.
you and all your pals should start smelling your own farts too
@SenateDems Thank you Senator Franken! Minnesota sees you and we are proud!
@RepBonamici Then why'd you vote against two gun control bills proposed by Republicans? This is politics not progress.
@RepBonamici Let's go with No bill & No break. Put the phones away.  Looks like you are all taking a rest as usual. #MAGA
@RepBonamici I am disappointed. Due process is an important thing prior to stripping constitutional rights from any citizen.
How many secret government lists are there, and how many Americans are on them?
Way to disarm Americans and encourage more muslim terrorist. Now I know why you are all jackasses.
easily the least funny snl cast member of all time & thats saying something. so glad others still respect #DueProcess & the #2A
@RepBonamici Be sure you have plenty of arm security before you commence your temper tantrum. Grow up.
And as your constituent, I thank you.
@RepBonamici oh, for crying out loud! Grow up!!!
.@SenFranken Strange to hear a liberal US Senator think it's OK to deprive people of their civil rights via a secret government list.
take your ball and go home. have your mommy make you your favorite sandwich
so you're proud to deprive due process and constitutional rights while ignoring ISLAMIC TERRORISM #NoBillNoBreak
@RepBonamici won't accomplish shit. # giveup
remember when you were an SNL writer?  you got more done then
@RepBonamici remember when senator fiengold told u to protect the constitution and not be a rubber stamp? U are doing it again.
Thank you Senator. All other amendments have common sense and reasonable limits and checks, why not the 2nd. The gun lobby & NRA
@RepBonamici go after the terrorists you knuckle heads!
thank you
Thank you Sen. Franken! Proud of you! It's time for change. #EnoughIsEnough
@MinnesotaDFL @FoxNews @CNN Doing NOTHING again! Millions out of work, Poor and elderly struggling, VA a mess, GET TO WORK!
@KimikoGlenn "...a  course of action to prohibit ... gun ownership in establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. -Lenin
@KimikoGlenn If you want to reduce gun violence eliminate gun-free zones and start packing a 9mm.  You'll be amazed.
@KimikoGlenn And I'm sure you don't get any contributions from Mr. Soros.
thank you!!!!
@deray @RepBonamici thank you
@RepBonamici-Proud to watch @HouseDemocrats exhibiting Theatre of the Lemmings. When you dismiss your armed guards, give notice.

@Kat4Obama Thank you Senator Al Franken (I never get tired of saying that)
Thank you for your leadership, Senator!
A big thank you from all of us back home in Minnesota!
@michelemorrow Rather pointless when the NRA has money and greedy Senators sell their votes, rather than save citizens lives.
thanks senator. Take it to them. Prove that our reps can make a difference.
