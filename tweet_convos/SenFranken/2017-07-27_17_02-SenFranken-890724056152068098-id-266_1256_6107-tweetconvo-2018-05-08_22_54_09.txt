Thank you Al for fighting the good fight for us
@JoeNBC @SenSasse ..Republicans cried for 7 years, that if ever given the power, they would repeal ACA..they now have power and did NOTHING.
How can @SenateMajLdr hold congress & the democratic process hostage like this?
Thank you @SenFranken and @maddow for doing what you do! @SenFranken is that #WillRogers behind you? #Oklahoma
That's Will Rogers behind you. "This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as when the baby gets hold of a hammer."
Now there would be a waste an hour out of my life that I won't get back. No thanks
Obamacare is EXPENSIVE

And if you don't buy it you have to pay a FINE

That is a terrible law http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/8057031/1/ â€¦
Will you finally be going on record in favor of single-payer?
Thanks for the warning
- Good, you make me feel safer  and so does Rachel. It's a scary time 
I'll be watching! Thank you so much for all you did these past 6 months, and all I know you will continue to do.
For that matter. Pols should tape "average Joes"more often for ideas Really get the pulse of the nation. DNC runs risk of the elitism of GOP
Please officially support national  #SinglePayer #nonprofit #healthcare. Healthcare is a right not a for-profit product.
Don't just talk; feel free to shout- I think it's deserved!!!
Oh my God to haters together in the same room fireworks will be blowing up why don't you to quit your Healthcare in join the exchange
Thanks for representing and fighting for the resistance Al!
Please thank your Republican colleagues Collins, McCain and Murkowski for their courage and integrity.
Thank you for your work, Sir.
Dems cannot float.  Now we have to push the POTUS to stop holding O.C. hostage.  He must reassure the insurers and commit to make payments.
Going to a propagandist. Not good Al. Try @jimmy_dore  or @JordanChariton or @LeeCamp. Thats how voters are going to know who to vote for.
This is a long shot that you read this. But I have a few excellent ideas for health care to build upon. #publicinput #ThinkOutsideTheBox
Oh please talk about how weird it is for Kid Rock to be running for Senate.  I need a good laugh
doesnt trumps base seem eerily like followers of jim Jones? Its is too brain washy the way they support him! #weird
thank you for kicking ass everyday in the senate sir!! Cant wait til I get your book!
@CNN just showed a moment of you addressing protesters outside of the Senate. Keep up the good fight for those of us who can't be there.
Sorry for you
Thank you, Senator! Huge relief this morning!
Thanks senator ! I'm a big fan, nowhere near your state except your state of mind ! Keep fighting big dawg !!
Trump HIRES his "Cocaine Man" GOD HELP us ALL
The story you told about how the govt helped your wife's family got me choked up Senator. Thank you for your govt service.
Thank You
@UdnSpeak4me @maddow I'm afraid for our democracy.
All sane people are but gird yer loins the battle is ahead!
#ImpeachTrumpAndPence #ImpeachTrumpAndPence #ImpeachTrumpAndPence #ImpeachTrumpAndPence #ImpeachTrumpAndPence #ImpeachTrumpAndPence
Will you post your interview, please? It's the only way that I could see it. Thank you.
Thank you for speaking to protestors right now
Watching C-Span...will catch you both later...HUGS!
I'm so glad your here!
Thanks @SenFranken and all @SenateDems for standing up for the American people.... the 99% appreciate the fight.
Idiots of a feather...
Keep fighting the fight, Al.  Minnesota is behind you
Al, you look very tired.  I hope you have some R&R planned after this craziness.
Keep fighting for us, Senator Franken
That's great but can you talk about americas expectations for Palestine? It's ludacrious they give pensions to terrorists and we fund it!
What can we do? I fear it's the end
How about helping with health care stupid both parties
Thank you @SenFranken for fighting for us, you have the admiration of millions millions in this country sir. I thank you for my family.
There has been a lot going on in Washington since January. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Does the #SkinnyRepeal do away w/Medicaid? If so, will I be covered for my doctor's appt tomorrow? I'm just super worried right now!
You'll be covered tomorrow.
Why are Grassley&Graham creating false narratives around Russia and FBI? When will they be ethical again?
I'm on vacation in Maine. I can't get Rachael. 
Please tell all your dem colleagues that the mandate and med device tax aren't on the table unless they want a primary fight on the table
Fight this bullshit!
You did a great job and gave as clear definition as possible. Thank you for making Minnesota look good
You were measured and helpful,but are scared.
Thank you, Senator Franken! It was great to get your thoughts and perspective on all of this crazy in the Trump administration.
Thank you for continuing to fight for us!  Your integrity gives me hope.
Stay strong Al...
Fight like OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT.
A guideline for your discussion #StopThePunk #PutinCameOntoTrumpLikeABitch
How do you speak about the Republican Congress without using the word sociopath? @chrislhayes @Lawrence
You mean the @GOP massive tax cut for billionaires?
#SinglePayer I hope.
@MaddowBlog @maddow GIVE HIM NOTHING BUT HELL, & Thousands of Salutes to You, SenFranken!
Sen. Al Franken for president. Please
Keep using the word "HATE" regarding the GOP and their healthcare plan. Dems need more aggressive talking points!!
Minnesota residents are lucky to have you represent themI'm in Indy 41 female, will people ever realize D's get elected to clean up R's B
You re the man !!!
Thank you for keeping it sorted for us, @SenFranken. We do appreciate it. Don't forget to eat something tonight.
Thank you for following the (lonely) straight and narrow path, Senator.
Mr. Franken. Thank you for being a calming and very sane voice amidst the trump chaos and abuse!  Keep up the good work for this country.
Senator Franken... stage a walk out and shut down the Senate. They can't vote without a quorum. You only need 2 R's.
If you cover All the govt news, the show may need a sensitive-viewers warning.
As much as I like @maddow, we're in dire need of reaching conservatives. You're preaching to the choir. Go on @FoxNews to #SaveACA.
Thanks for all you do Senator Franken!!!  Nice to see you on @madow !!
I bet on days like today, you wish you could put your SNL hat back on for a bit ; )
We need him impeached now
can you talk about the inherent intellectual dishonesty in trying to pass a bill that you don't want signed into law?
Washington is quickly going to hell in a hand basket! We have unhinged people in our @Whitehouse! They make Kim Jong Un the sane one!
I am disabled single mom caring for son & elderly dad w/health issues. Please help. Need bipartisian fix of ACA not Skinny Bill punt.
LOCK THEM UP ALREADY!!!!!
Today's news has inflamed a growing sense of dread. Justice is in the process of being liquidated by a band of Scarface extras.
#trump n #Scarface turning US into a political Siberia where only the most vile will remain. Let's foil their plan and stand our ground.
Off camera of course...will you hug her for me? You both help give me faith in the possibility of a return to sanity!!
Waiting for you Senator.. watching

@MaddowBlog @maddow I like me people like me.....
I cannot get over your wolf vote Al Franken!  I'm a Minnesotan and was a hugh fan for a long time.  BUT This cruel vote.....well no more!
Can't wait to hear how @SenateDems can stop this debacle. @SenateGOP #GodSaveTheACA #IStandWithPP #KeepKidsCovered
Can't wait
Thank you!!
How about Russia too?
Please keep fighting to stop the bill!  Thank you.
YES!!! Love her show, love you. What happened with the "not sworn in"/sworn in guys' statement?
Cool. What time?
Wonderful. We cld use a bit of humor from a normal, sane legislator.  Hope you run for pres in 2020.  The pig will have no chance if u do.
I always enjoy listening to u & it's even better when ur on with @maddow. She's the best! Keep fighting the good fight Senator Franken!
Looking forward Senator! Btw reading and loving your book! To be able to laugh out loud during this current climate in DC is remarkable! TU

You be living in a SNL sketch these days 
When will the leaks stop?
Hope you can illuminate situation #fubar
Born and raised there, gone now but still love the state. Al & Amy are great representatives and people. Keep fighting for Justice, thankyou
I don't have cable TV.  Saving $.
Almost like one of your SNL skits except it"s really happening.
@maddow get ready for some affirmation!!!
Fix this please. Pls run!
How about talking about the @GOP House voting to fund the border wall?!?
@MaddowBlog @maddow thank you
Franken on Maddow, unmissable :-)
That's good,I'll be watching
Can you lead the ticket for 2020 ? We need a straight shooter with charisma. You have it!!!!!
Tow of my favorite, intelligent, rational voices. Can't wait!!
Oh boy!
Will @maddow be supplying you with one of her famous tin foil hats that prevents the Russians from hacking into your brain? #McCarthyism
You're boring. Stay off TV so we can win.
Derp
Ok. I understand healthcare is top priority but PLEASE make a joke on the mobster communications director
Will you now?  Cute.
Will be proudly watching Senator Franken on TRMS tonight. I'm a proud constituent. I switched video services just to watch TRMS. Go TEAM!
Will Def Be Watching !!!! #RachelMaddow
It will be a relief to listen to two knowledgeable, calm, sane people after all the craziness of this week.
Wish you had a daily segment
@MaddowBlog @maddow yey, thank you Senator, keep up the fight for us, we deeply appreciate.
Never ending list....until we Vote him out in his face!!
Tell Randy "hi"
Would you please run for president? I think you'd be great.
YAY! So glad Steve Bannon isn't going to be on after what Moochie said about him today.  Although it might be entertaining, I'm not a fan.
snl has been n madcow mangirl, great combo! He pretends, she dreams of being that man body!
Go get 'em, Senator!
Dont be surprised when you get primaried and or defeated by kid rock
Thank you and please #VoteNo

I think you're swell.
Yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Two of my HEROES!!!!!
Run for president @SenFranken !!!
Are you going to announce that you're running for president?
Can we pleeeeeaaasse get you thoughts on moochie, Rience, and Bannon?  Pretty Pleaaaaassssseeeeeee?  With sugar on top?
You mean shit going to hell and back?
thank you.  I stand with all the care orgs, church communities, & neighborly citizens who want to keep ACA.
You must call Rachel by her name. Don't like it when her guess don't. I like to be happy. Just saying
Long agenda - glad it's you two!
I like Franken, but I noted a bit of hesitation with his some of his answers last time. I don't understand why 
How about who likes to suck their own cock?  Will you be talking about that?  Because the WH comms director is.
Both my favorites. We are tuning in. #KeepFighting #keepfight #resist #saveourdemocracy #realpatriots #maga #ImpeachTrumpNow
Thank you! Knowing you're fighting the MANY fights affecting all Americans, is one of the only bright spots in this shit show.
Can't wait!
Thank you @SenFranken and @amyklobuchar
Dear @SenFranken
Why does the man we call POTUS get to act like a ruler? How does he get to lie to his followers & turn them against govt?
He may be our Pres, but he's doing everything in his power to get his followers to hate govt &him. He wants his followers to only trust him
I remember the "Only I can fix this..."  words of a dictator.
It's showtime @maddow tonight
I doubt SNL could have come up w/ this clustered*#k!
A lot going on = Gone bat shit crazy?
Thank you, Sir! Total trust and admiration for you and others who do what is right for Americans!
Thank you for all you do @SenFranken. Looking forward to hearing you.
Tell @LindseyGrahamSC he's about to let @SpeakerRyan stab him in the back, and he's too smart for that!
Making popcorn, settling in for Maddow, Lawrence and my fav Sen Al 
Save us!
Please, for the love of democracy, run for President.
Are you going to talk about #filibusterbyamendment?
@SenFranken be sure to bring up Wasserman Schultz, Awan brothers, the real evidence ect ect. @maddow will go ballistic for us. #Popcorn
I'd love to see you run for POTUS as soon as the seat is vacated. I'd totally support you. !!!
You mean Wealth Care...
Two of my favorite people - @SenFranken and @maddow! Plz blink once if we are going 2 be ok and twice if I should get a new passport.
EXCELLENT America is loving you Al. Your courage is so appreciated. @easilymoved @ADIC33 @gzusscripes1 @GeorgeTakei @KamalaHarris
As always, it should be interesting.  Thank you for your continued good service to our country
Thankyou
To put it mildly Al.
Thanks @SenFranken  see you then!
@SenFranken Can SC adopt you? Think about it. You and @LindseyGrahamSC talking about a "skinny bill." 
Franken and Maddow you are two of my heroes. BTW some thought 'skinny repeal' means no one can be discriminated for their pants size!
My two faves in 1 place! Yay!
Will you be calling out the insanity of your colleagues from across the aisle?
I'll be watching!
Looking forward to watching.
Minnesota senators make us proud!  Thank you for fighting for us @SenFranken @amyklobuchar
I'm a proud Minnesotan! Thanks Al & Amy!
YES!!!!

thanks for the warning
My grandfather always said, 

"There's 2 kinds of people in this world: 
those that get ulcers 
& those that give 'em"
Don't settle. VOTE NO.
Will be waiting to watch
Can't wait to hear you! Now, could you ban that little Italian Mafia man and 45 from America's Whitehouse?!
I would like to hear more about the stupid GOP request for a second counsel to investigate Comey, Lynch and Clinton.  Waste of money.
I will be there!
Hope it's to celebrate the NO vote on skinny deal!
Yay!
You bet there is!! I'll be watching tonight. #holdtheline @SenFranken
