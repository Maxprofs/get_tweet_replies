Mushkaad is one of the reasons I pledge to keep fighting against travel bans that are wrong for Minnesota and our nation.
Work for Americans 4 a refreshing change. The rank oder of obstruction must be eliminated from the halls of Congress. Ban Burkas

Fantastic!  I'm so glad she is with her family. 
Stop with the bleeding heart crap! We need ban in place, & a few were temporarily affected.
Since new ban was again blocked by a liberal judge, it will be on you if we have more attacks.

Thank you for helping Mushkaad reunite with her family. You give me hope!
You are the best Senator Franken. If you ever run for president you have my vote.

@SenateDems @amyklobuchar @POTUS #TheInfantile kept her out & I thank Al for bringing her home. #SwattingGiants
I'll take "The sort of acts that get your name inscribed in the Book of Life" for $800, Alex.
She looks terrifying. Were you scared? She's obviously up to no good.
@SenateDems @amyklobuchar @POTUS invite her to stay with funny guy, I'm sure you have room
@SenateDems @amyklobuchar @POTUS  and at a mall no less. How American is that?!?
@SenateDems @amyklobuchar @POTUS Makes me wonder what great things Mushkaad could do for US one day. Perhaps even a MN Senator.
Well done sir 
she is so CUTE. :D
@SenateDems @amyklobuchar @POTUS
This is the SWEETEST THING EVER
She looks like a terrorist, all right. I'll bet she steals hearts wherever she goes! Deport her!!
@SenateDems @amyklobuchar @POTUS I'm sure there is more to the story.

There is some humanity in politics after all. Thank you!
@InSpiteOfTrump @amyklobuchar @POTUS thank you Sen. Al and your staff!!!
you are the greatest. Hands down
Mushkaad separated from her mother for 3 yrs and you try to insinuate that it was President Trump's fault.
Seeing a kid laughing like that makes the day.
Thank you, senators. Your service is keeping my hope alive.
Thank you my senators!
You're a good egg Sen. Franken.
This is why I love you, Al!
What a cutie!
She's adorable.
Must have been a good joke.  :-)  Thanks for caring about reuniting kids with their parents. Excellent!
How wonderful. Thank you for your kind actions to everyone involved. It's a good action that's appreciated.
This is a great photo
An act that could pay off in a hundred different positive ways in the future of our country.
she is too cute!
Human compassion...what a great concept.
