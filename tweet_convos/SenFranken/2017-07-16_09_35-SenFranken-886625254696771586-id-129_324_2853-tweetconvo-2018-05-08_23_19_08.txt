Thanks to @MayoClinic for its excellent care – I appreciate your support & look forward to getting back to work! https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=FF8ABBEC-F6BB-45F6-8E8D-A4D3BA906C83 …
Funny how it's OK to use our tax money to pay for their health care but not for our health care. I want to see his final bill.
You are a class act Senator Franken. You give me hope that there really are good guys fighting the good fight.
John , good luck and fast recovery but don't rush back,  in fact , just retire,  it's way overdue
yes, we pay for their healthcare and we get none,,,be gone mccain,
Too sad  he wants to deny such care for millions of people
Good thing you have Healthcare that covers EVERYTHING! Unlike Trumpcare!
But will he vote for others to get this great care?  I doubt it.
http://strib.mn/2nCOjQ6  I don't begrudge the good care Mc Cain got. Wish him well. But, doesn't everyone deserve the same?
WOW, @SenJohnMcCain ~MAYO CLINIC~Only the best @ taxpayers' expense for you who'll vote against same for the rest of us.

#Hypocrite
@SenJohnMcCain Same here Stay hydrated #SinglePayer #SinglePayerSunday #MoreHumanismLessTheism #ETHICS #Reason #Logic #Compassion #Education
@SenJohnMcCain glad you enjoyed the tax payer funded healthcare. Now you can get back to taking away access to it for the rest of us
Everyone deserves healthcare
If I were a betting woman, I would bet Senator McCain is grateful for his taxpayer insurance.
How about a recover but, long enough after the Senate goes home in Aug? Hope everyone's family can get diagnosed at an annual checkup.
So glad he has such good health insurance, right?
Yeah, thank goodness for tax payer funded health care! Now to get back to the business of denying it to others!
So glad you've got good health care.  Important isn't it?
Hope he dose ok. And hope he has good healthcare.
I wish @SenJohnMcCain a speedy recovery as well. I would also ask that he NOT vote to take health insurance away from people.No on #DonTcare
I also wish Senator McCain a speedy recovery and do hope this is a time for him to reflect on what the GOP plan would do to sick people. #NO
I hope he looks at his itemized bill and what theninsurance took care of.
It's wonderful to have health insurance.   Comfort of having it when you need it is immeasurable. @SenJohnMcCain
@SenJohnMcCain @MayoClinic nice to have great healthcare John! And you want to take it all away from simple Americans! get well!
For some, sadly, it's hold the Mayo.
Maybe he'll have a change of heart about health care bill. One can hope.
good thing he has congressional healthcare huh?
Best wishes for a quick recovery and a gutsy no vote on Trumpcare
Please vote no on trumpcare!
Glad you're getting good gov't funded healthcare @senjohnmccain #Irony
“@SenFranken: Wishing Jihad John McCain a quick recovery, so he's fit to stand trial for TREASON! 
#CRIMINALSCUM
Get well soon Senator McCain!  What insurance plan do you have that allows you to get treatment at the Mayo Clinic????
Is it a little hard to realize that the most excellent care you get to have is something you can't wait to make sure everyone else doesn't?
John, thanks for keeping Trump in line, get well soon
Sen McCain is fortunate to have health insurance which won't bankrupt him. So many Americans-not so lucky,  w/others losing their coverage.
A gentleman you are
@SenJohnMcCain glad you have great health care on my dime. Please vote NO or give all the same care you & congress get? I think that's fair.
@SenJohnMcCain @MayoClinic 
Health care for everyone! Ted Cruz would have let you die. Vulgarian trump would have let you die.Paul Ryan-dito
My God you have class, @SenFranken :)
what"man"contemplates war over healthcare for the people"he"represents;$600Byr 4defense contractors2 pool vs $95Byr for ACA citizen care-sad
Good thing you've got health insurance!
just think , if he had trumpcare he wouldn't have been covered
A fine facility, fully staffed by Liberals.
Was the cost covered by Medicaid?
# FakeCaring
Sure is nice the @SenJohnMcCain had such great health care, isnt it!
Now vote NO on the failing Trumpcare plan Senato McCain!   Do the right thing!!
Make good healthcare available to everyone, not just the rich and those in Congress
America will be great again when every American has the same healthcare as every member of Congress. It's what the doctor ordered.
@SenJohnMcCain    You are welcome for your free healthcare provided by my taxes! Vote NO on this GOP abomination trumpcare 3.0. Disaster
Anyone notice there was only one photo op visit from Trump and Pence to their good friend Scalise?
Nice to have healthcare
How about letting the rest of us have the same peace of mind, sen. McCain ?
@SenJohnMcCain ironic that the Senate is trying to eliminate coverage for millions, while it's own members get A+ coverage???
McCain will come from great GOV health care to vote 2 repeal Obamacare & screw poor and chronically ill by voting for crappy Trumpcare. SAD
Take your time, perhaps Divine intervention to prevent passage of the equally disastrous GOP health insurance bill, NO AGE PENALTY, vote NO
Think he'll pass mustard at the Mayo, or is he in a pickle?
Imagine if every American had that same access? The ability to get quality care w/o fear of destitution.
Glad ur okay, @SenJohnMcCain.   Now please, when you get back, vote no on the death bill.
He served our country & he IS a hero. Get well John.
Good news is John has healthcare insurance paid by taxpayers and won't go bankrupt. Maybe he'll become empathetic for the millions without.
Hope his insurance doesn't deny Coverage.  Senator Al look out for the guy please
let's hope McCain now realizes the importance of our health care system & votes NO!!
glad you had great Medicare get back to work soon taking it away from the rest of us
Your welcome, don't worry about anything, my braking my back for years working helped pay for it. Thanks for your service. Don't use your $

Notice he isn't giving up his ACA insurance, but yet he's pushing TrumpCare for his constituents.
God's care and healing energy be with you John McCain
Best wishes but don't the rest of us deserve the best too?
Ô the irony of the killer #BCRA bill held up by .@GOP's .@SenJohnMcCain, whose Obamacare is saving him so he can kill us (not Congress).
imagine if @SenJohnMcCain had to pay full price for his surgery.
Good to know you guys have such good healthcare!
And has healthcare to cover it and $ 4 airfare to get there
Come back in good health and save the nation from #TrumpNoCare
Of course, you had excellent care.  You were admitted to one of the finest hospitals in the world and didn't have to rely on Obama Care. DUH
Absolutely, speedy recover!!! Ponder had a Democratic Senator taken ill, would the vote be postponed...
Get well soon, Sen McCain.
And good thing you have ACA!!!
Get Well John McCain and Best wishes..:):)
Lucky him to have the best insurance
When you're back on your feet, remember, how you felt sick and on your back. Now think of others.
...so thanks...i paid my taxes and sent to die. You all rob us blind and free top notch healthcare. Thanks. Appreciate it!
It's a good thing @SenMcCain has healthcare. Be a shame if millions of Americans lost theirs. 
@SenJohnMcCain Heals on our we pay his healthcare & r waiting 4 him 2 vote 2 kill Medicaid & kick your grandmother out of her nursing home
...are waiting to be voted out if healthcare all together. Enjoy getting all taken care of for you. This taxpayer was relegated to die...
Such great healthcare at Mayo. He is very fortunate.
He'll be right back to talking the talk then voting in lockstep with the GOP #partybeforecountry
@SenJohnMcCain @MayoClinic must be nice having health insurance, huh John?
Its great that our members of congess have such full and complete socialist healthcare packages, at the expense of the taxpayers. Who now...
'Work'?
Now. if McCain would just stop being a little Trump toady
Bet it helped he didn't have to fret about health insurance during such a scary life moment. Maybe Americans should have the same relief
Healthcare is wonderful, ain't it though???
@SenJohnMcCain @MayoClinic Yes. All Americans should have such wonderful health care.
...We need John...
Dear God McCain is speaking with some sense regarding the Russia investigation. He's got great insurance. And hopefully the of best care.
Why does the left cry about taking away, stealing, robbing.... HC from millions. Those millions still have HC just not forced through govt
Just finished your book, where you plugged the Mayo Clinic a lot...hopefully McCain sees them as a positive, too, and votes NO on Trumpcare!
Why not the VA
@MayoClinic rocks!  Has helped 3 members of my family. They're amazing at what they do!!
Again-best care in the country-MN healthcare rocks & with due respect save the ACA so all can enjoy good health
Wishing Sen. McCain a speedy recovery!
Now, please, Sen. McCain...vote NO!
I do wish him well. Maybe this is Gods way of making him see the light and vote NO on trumpcare
Sometimes sm misfortunes are placed at our feet to raise our consciousness. Hopefully he will see this as a sign to think and vote no.
Best wishes for Mr @SenJohnMcCain
And looking forward to your return to the Senate where you can provide an urgently needed vote to take healthcare away from millions.
Now get well..and vote no..so others can have healthcare..
@SenJohnMcCain Everyone deserves healthcare, not just those who are fortunate to have great coverage,so you are able to treat at Mayo Clinic

Divine intervention God has put his thumb on the scale this clot will change history McCain will vote NO, The Lord works in his own way
Amen.
Get well quickly Senator I am praying for your recovery
His doctor needs the Medal of Honor #Wealthcare
Let's remember what he's going to vote "yes" on as soon as he's up and about
DJT ever send good wishes Mr. McCain's way or is he too busy worrying about ratings and who won the electoral college?
Watching lady golfers
@SenJohnMcCain I truly do wish you a good & speedy recovery. Nobody likes being ill. Think about that please.
I hope you get well soon too. Illness is awful. Imagine adding bankruptcy fears to the misery of illness. Pls consider that when you vote.
Get better, but take awhile to recover please. Vote NO
Yes, nothing but the best health care for those who can pay for it!
We pay for it.
And we pay and pay and pay and pay.
great that he has health insurance that covers it
Good thing he had healthcare!
Good thing he has that great government health care plan.
Get well 
Classy Al.
Of course McCain Is a democrat
