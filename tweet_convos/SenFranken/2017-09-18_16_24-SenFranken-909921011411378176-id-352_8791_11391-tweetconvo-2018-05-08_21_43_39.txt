Wolf hater. You co-sponsored the War on Wolves Act, loser.
If we do all we can and the Bill passes, we will at least know we gave it our all, and then make their lives miserable, esp. #DOTARD
And, work to repeal and replace the GOP.
Exactly, and we will.
1/Have you used the Resist bot. You text the word "resist" to 50409.  It will ask you where you live, to know who your reps are.
2/ After that you can use it to send letters to your reps and to call. It turns your txt into a formatted letter and will send via fax.
3/Makes it very manageable.
I know I am a stranger, you can search for it on Twitter if you want more info. I use it a lot and no problems.
THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS DO IT...DID U KNOW UNDER OUR 1ST BLACK PRESIDENT BLACKS ARE WORSE OFF THEN EVER  LOST AN AVG $4K INCOME 8 YRS OF OBAMA
let's hope that they are smart enough to realize they vote for it they will not get people's vote
Thanks from a constituent. I feel a bit powerless here in MN, since we have such good support for you know, not killing people.
I wish I had senators that didn't have heads stuck up their asses&wanted to kill off most of their state.@SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue
Ungh. We always need good docs in MN. Join us!
That is appealing 
Call, people! This ain't over yet!
I am so pissed at @LindseyGrahamSC  -  posed as someone who with a conscience, and now sells out to the Koch Bros!  #SaveACA
"Maternity" not part of Graham bill. Are they worried about that splinter polygamy cult arrested for welfare fraud in SLC recently?
It's the Republicans population control bill.
And maybe the new world's order to kill off the population
I'm sitting here, lost my mncare, without pain relief after a molar extraction, & don't have $4 to buy my blood pressure pills
Hubby WAS being evaluated for COPD from industrial work exposure, CAN'T BREATH without inhaler, & Dr. won't re-prescribe w/o further test
Serious question: how many calls from Americans equals a single Koch phone call?  Just trying to work out the math.
Millions
NV Republican gov opposes bill; NV Republican Sen Heller is co-signer. He doesn't care it will hurt his constituents. Blame Citizens United.
@GOP doesn't care about lives of Millions of Americans bc they make their money off bribes. These repeated votes are to punish dissenters.
"Citizens United" court ruling made bribing MUCH easier.
Obama & Hillary STUPIDITY  an you wonder why Hillary lost an are 0-6 in runoff elections  lost THE HOUSE,SENATE,PRESIDENCY,1200 STATE SEATS

Call your senators and especially these senators now.  It's a horrible bill for cancer patients, women, those with pre-existing conditions.
Alexander's phones off only get busy signal.
Lamar Alexander did this before and while he championed the highly unqualifed DeVos as Ed Sec'y. If he's not accessible, he doesn't belong
You hear the right talk about "elites." What is more "elite" than a guy like Lamar Alexander w/ his phone off the hook to duck constituents?
@SenFranken please do all you can to stop this GOP plan. It will create unhealthy USA
Go back to SNL you hysterical, uninformed foolish man.  Seriously.
Just saw @SenFranken on @jimmykimmel and he is not for the hatchet Graham/Cassidy BS Bill. There's hope. We have to keep making those calls.

Because I preexist I will B the ones that die NONE of these R for pain or mood elevated drugs Just a day in the life 
Thank you for being so candid on @jimmykimmel
Thank you, and I have called my senators to ask them to vote no on the bill.
What is left of ACA if this passes? How will the majority pay for Health Care? We all knw Health Ins Co's will rob us even more!
Yep...and this.
Tea, your wit reminds me of Franken's.
It's 800 billion tax cut Koch Bros are after They'll get 10s of billions, probably 1000% return. So nothing personal it's just business. Sad
Thank you!  @SenFranken

Evil GOP are again attempting to rush a vote for their full ACA repeal. Please, #Resist actively.
A peaceful protester did the right thing & China executed him.
@GOP wants to execute MILLIONS of Americans.
@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski
We need for YOU to run for President, Senator Franken.
Health care or... genocide?
So the @GOP literally could care less that AMA, AARP, Cancer, Arthritis, MS & other advocacy groups say the bill is horrible.
#KillTheBill
Please introduce bill that members of Congress must have the same health care they're proposing! TY!

Everyone NEEDS to listen to Sen. Franken's explanation of what the Cassidy/Graham bill be I'll do. Call, call, call, call your Senators. ☏
They are obsessed with doing anything just to get the "Obama" name off of it. Nothing else matters.
Don't take my health care away I need major back surgery to be able to keep walking !
Shut up Al your state a heaven for illegals and terrorist
Reported muted have a nice day
It has the same issues as the last one that Graham spoke out against. He must be feeling the pressure from big $$$. At the cost of millions
If you care that much, you shouldn't have helped Sanders et al derail the HC convo. 

As your constituent, I'm hugely disappointed.
What? Franken came out for Hillary big time and was booed for it at our state convention. He did not coddle Bernie at all.
He just stood with Sanders & the DOA Med4All fake bill, which has helped the Rs and derailed the HC convo.
He & 15 other Dems took the opportunity to have photo op for a useless 'bill'. Almost all are possible 2020 contenders who want to look prog
IMO, it was a bad political decision & as his constituent, it's my JOB to tell him what I think. 

No one has to agree with me, but many do
It's do or die says no democrat to this bill
Put a hold on it.
Ask Americans to contact Senators/ House Reps and demand a NO vote
My response: GFY
Been calling three senators a day
Yep, Gina roll right over you. Cheers
DONT JUST RETWEET CALL YOUR SENATORS I called mine!!
This is horrible again we have to go through this
Keep up the fight Senator.
My mom has severe dementia and I depend on Medicaid and Medicare for her to have the care she needs. #saveaca #SaveOurCare
The @GOP is going to let Americans die - for a $400M Koch bribe, if they deliver on tax cuts via #GrahamCassidy 
I called both from NC, and the Reps. Price said he was voting "no." We just need to keep going.
Don't let them do it!
How can this gain steam when it is worse than previous bills (rhetorical question) ?  So so scared. This significantly affects me.
Why on earth would you call it a "health care bill"?
So why are you not on TV discussing this....We continue to call ...yet you write a statement? Dems on the capital steps fighting this?
This sickens me  We MUST take back our Country @GOP pack your bags, an election and pink slip in your future. We will NOT take it anymore.
I dont get it!! Do you want DACA or not? Personally I think the premiums are too high, but the dreamers need to know who has their backs!!
Where's @SenSanders? Right hollering we need single payer & blackmailing Dems 2 get on board or die in 2020. Sounds just like the Death Bill
@JohnCornyn @sentedcruz are deaf to people saying don't vote for this bill. Party and wealthy first.
Why can't they just fix the ACA?
Bernie once again helping the R's. No friend of the Dems. McCain needs to say no because it's only got worse.
it's like the more opposition they face (doctors, hospitals, AARP, constituents) the more they will act out of spite.  #GOPDontCare
Why can't Chuck Schumer shut down the Senate? No unanimous consent on anything until October 1.
Not surprise that some crap Alexander would do, he needs to go.
Stop their HC madness!!
It doesn't repeal joker
If this passes, we all need to drop insurance.I don't want them to make a dime off of me.
The continued funding of the war machine will be wrought over the uninsured bodies of the populace. 
From May 4th this year. Some turnabout @LindseyGrahamSC
. You wish. A false narrative will not make this true Senator Franken. Stop the hate. Compromise or resign.
I have a feeling Senator Fraken knows just a little vit more than you do about it. He isnt a cheep Liar like Potus.
Unfortunately this is not true Franken has no experience whatsoever in healthcare and he is biased as the day is long. Educate yourself
If you see @SenToomey tell him PA is trying to get ahold of him & we are not very happy with him...Tell him to answer his phones! & VOTE NO!
We are calling -Tweeting & Emailing we need @TheDemocrats to #JamTheAgenda #HoldTheFloor #DemandCBO #DemandHearings We are stronger w/ YOU
That's HORRIBLE!!!
Thank you, @SenFranken! So grateful to have you and @amyklobuchar fighting for us in the Senate.
Call your representatives. Don't be an accomplice to #GOP murder.

because free is better
This bill would eliminate care for foster children & medically complicated children. It would strip care from millions.
Call (202) 224-3121
Will #GOP pass a law that kills 1000 x more people than hurricanes #Harvey & #Irma combined? How evil R THEY? #GrahamCassidy
I can't emphasize strongly enough how much this needs to be killed/voted down. As a constituent, I'm glad you're a "NO" vote

Please keep fighting those heartless criminals who put money first. Not Americans. #GrahamCassidyBill
i'm not on facebook anymore, i still am voicing my feelings by calling  the capitol and putting my name,city behind my messages to congress
We ALL need to call @SenateGOP and STOP #GrahamCassidyMurderBill Republican patients feel horrible effects of this bill too! #MAGA #Resist
Do you think the #GOP would be focused on debt ceiling talks had @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi not a cut a deal with @realDonaldTrump?
@GOP @VP @POTUS  Knowledge is POWER which is why you want to keep  Americans in the dark?  WE SEE THROUGH THE CRAP bill you've proposed.
Really
Harris, Warren, Booker, Franken...there go your "progressive" heroes. 
ACA is gaining speed in its cost, when were you going to sound the alarm about that?
Al Franken, please don't let this health bill go through!  We need your help and strength right now. Get enough  republicans to vote no!
Al, stop this. Even if you have to physically stop this from happening. Soldier up.
The @GOP seem to have no heart. The want to see the sick and poor suffer and die! So sad. Bankrupt them. Never vote for them again, Ever!
I'm terrified, appalled and physically ill.
Please don't use Facebook- it helped elect trump
They are all pigs, greedy self-centered pigs
Shout out how the Koch brothers promised the heartless @GOP  money so they are selling out on protecting the American people. @GOP greed.
WOW, Happy  Last night about 5am someone released a series of yea/nay on bill. They said you and E. Warren were yea, and enemies of us.
At what point do we consider the GOP a Hate Group?
Mass murder is illegal.
@GOP is literally Organized Crime
Let's Make America Great Again! Let's REPEAL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!!
RED ALERT! Let's finally get rid of the terrible http://O.Care ! Are you listening RINO-RATs!? @SenJohnMcCain @SenateMajLdr
When people start dying I want graveyards to be setup in every republican's front yard. That are such assholes All of them

What are you doing about it? Are you making any Republican friends???
Thank you for standing against this terrible bill. I'm proud to have you as my senator. Keep up the good work.
Where's Obama?  #silenceistheenemy
Do these men get excited when they see Million of people lose health care coverage?
What do we do if we're in a Democratic state??

.@SecPriceMD's private-jet travel breaks precedent http://politi.co/2fyHQE2  via @ddiamond & @rachanadixit 
Thank you. Now bring us MEDICARE FOR ALL and don't compromise.  Nothing less will do.
WELL GROW A PAIR SENATOR AND LEAD DON'T FOLLOW!
@janjer1 I've so HAD IT with this @GOP! Damn, can we take their health insurance away!?
why Dem Senator can't do a filibuster?
Don't think filibuster rules apply with a reconciliation vote scenario.
Repeal the fine!!!
Hey #GOP

No worry

#TrumpCare will #White #Genocide your #Base.

#Latinos Will Fix things in 2030 - permanently.
Help sound the alarm. New GOP health care bill to repeal the ACA is gaining steam. My response: https://sen.gov/5XZ8 
Why does the GOP want to kill us
Your response should be "I will cover all those people "
Don't worry. Bernie Sanders is holding a rally Friday about his plans to replace the GOP plan with BernieCare.
You are a comedian oh wait a us senator as well.
How many times are we going to have to fight for our healthcare?
Trump care For Everybody!

Poverty by a crude reform.

#MakeAnagramsGreatAgain
Know what's interesting,my daughters a PA. Says if have ins,pay a co pay$45 + mo ins premium. If no ins, office visit $80. Hmm no ins cheapr
It's clearly just exactly what they did before only now they're including bribes for the states where those no vote Republicans are.
How can this happen? How can the Koch brothers rule? Y'all are supposed to represent we, the people!
The only alarm I help to sound is that you are a shlemazl.
I can only guess
thank God, the hard working taxpayers need help
Sounds like the GOP doesn't care what anyone thinks. They just really hate the black guy.
And he was only half black. Imagine how they feels about Shaq or Denzel or Le Bron?
I am a 55-or old woman with a chronic mental health condition. This isn't looking very good.
Really wish you had sounded the alarm on the defense appropriations increase.
I thought Senate already voted ....someone explain how this can happen!! But 1st call your representative ASAP and save #ACA! !!!
@congressdotgov we are watching you closer THAN EVER.  Remember #ACA is THE 50%+ factor as to whether you'll keep your seat.  TY Sen Al!!
@SenFranken leaves two choices, the crash and burn of #Obamacare, or $1.4T in new spending and 52% tax rate for #Medicare4All - really?
Send a message to House and Senate Republicans who vote to repeal the ACA.  The loss of your seat is now a preexisting condition.
Shaaaduup tool. Yeah, you're not here with a pointed agenda at all.
Trump2020 baby! 
If kill every 2nd born child was in the bill these dumb fucks would still vote for it, just to get rid of the ACA
Just called Moran and asked him to vote no on Graham-Cassidy. Roberts (KS) is a lost cause.
People over politics!! Yes!!
McCain 202-224-2235
Murkowski 202-224-6665
Collins 202-224-2523
Portman 202-224-3353
Capito 202-224-6472
Alexander 202-224-4944
Would you any of you Sen. or Congress people, give up your gov funded healthcare, for whats proposed? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. Why dump on us then
It's called the Trump Train 
Keep fighting for us Al & we'll keep calling our senators. A sorry lot here in TX
Thank you for opposing this terrible bill. Please work across the aisle to fix the ACA!
Let it happen and make the GOP own the shit show that follows.
true, but unfortunately millions of Americans esp. those older, babies, women & w/ pre-existing conditions will suffer
Maybe we have to suffer a bit to start making the right decisions on election day.
What is the Alarm? The ACA is in the Tank in the State of Minnesota! Have you forgot who in the Hell you represent? You should be fired!
@weareoversight @RandPaul @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @MikeLeeforUtah @SenAlexander @SenCapito @JerryMoran @senrobportman
Good, ACA needs to go.
Do what you can to stop the bullshit sabre rattling against the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela.I think it is our only hope for demicracy
STOP #CORRUPTION #shakopeemdewakantonsiouxcommunity #smsc
#HealthForAll #Resistance #WeThePeople call for action most important issue today for millions!
The fact that I can count on my fingers the Senators who voted against a $700 Billion war budget is beyond shameful Why didn't you? phony!!
why did you vote for 700bn in military spending?
STOP THEM NOW!!!
You must fight to the end to stop this, Senator. Thanks for your good work.
Is there a searchable speadsheet of this? Or a PDF sorted by STATE?
Yes, let the GOP have this cruel rotten bill, for their own healthcare, and give America, the healthcare plan the Senate voted itself.
We need a bipartisan healthcare bill. N/Or fix #ACA to make affordable 4 All!  Stop #trumpcare. Stop GOP congressional dictatorship!
Love the fax tool. Doubt it will help with rat bastard Toomey, but I keep trying.
Uh oh...an effing ex unfunny comedian doesn't like it
@SenCoryGardner vote no! #saveACA #killthebill
WHY???
Stop the #GOPWarOnHealthcare !!!
I'm a business owner is AZ
O'care is crushingly expensive 
Congress voted themselves out of O'care 
Why force it on
Because we don't want to die while the 1% gets a tax break.
I'm in the 1%
If u knew the advantages Obama gave us u would claim it's a lie
It was almost embarrassing-but we used it
If you're in the 1%, then quit bitching about how "crushingly expensive" everything is. Your voting & thinking makes total sense now.
Just becuz I don't need it now
Doesn't erase that I once did
Government is only friendly 2 their donors 
Speaks Loudly
Then why not vote for the people who, unlike you, need help & stop voting for those who only favor the 1% like yourself? Oh. Right.
Cuz I employ & insure & give great benefits & help grow
Thousands of wonderful young people


Get rid of ACA.
Why are you afraid of justices who idealize respected men?  Why do you fear Clarence Thomas?  Why do you have no shame?
Why are you holding back qualified judges for purely partisan reasons? http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/09/the-franken-fallout.php …  That is an alarm worth sounding.
Thank you!
Ty for standing against this. I have stage 4 cancer, my son has autism. GOP is killing me faster then cancer. #saveACA #protectourcare
Do not let this happen to us Democrats and others!!
Al what the fuck exactly do you stand for?
@nonnie7696
Mandate that it is the Healthcare plan for the Senate if it's so darn good.
GOOD REPEAL THE ACA NOW all it's done is make health care unaffordable
let's hope it passes
Al Frankenstein when you and your family have Obamacare as your only health ins maybe then but until that happens don't preach to me Jerk!
Mr.Frankin,dear sir ive seen u some were before was it on a comedy skit or a congressional hearing seat? I a also smoke weed but here it is.

Our story.
Warning. It s a thread about the current state of healthcare insurance and its bleak future. It's very blunt. Crude. And it's our story ..
This matters.  Please keep fighting for us and our healthcare. TY.
@KenBurns @pbs disgusting to watch Viet cong veterans smile, gloat and brag over killing Americans . Disgusting!
