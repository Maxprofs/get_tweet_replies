You won't support single payer? It's time for you to get primaried.
I VOTE to keep my tax$$$ & @GOP can keep their asses HOME
Why should we pay for the destruction of America
fess up al..........dems wanted o-care to fail so they could install single payer
is it wrong to think Americans have the right to form thier own list of demands we need our own voice
@SenFranken thanks for all you do You are great
Sen. Franken.  Great show last night.  And Thanks for everything you do.  I know you will always have our backs!!!!
We shouldn't call it Trump "care"
  It's  Trump DOESN'T  care
Screw McCain and anyone who's ok with this "open debate".. we know the truth. Millions will DIE. McCain deserves NO Sympathy. #ShameOnMcCain
Call it what it is #DeathByGOP will be the leading cause of death.
The GOP are proud of making the disabled & elderly & children that are poor suffer.
Thank u .@SenFranken u seem to be the hardest working sen.trying to save healthcare. U aren't my senator but I'll support any national run
#MedicareForAll #SinglePayerNow This is what the people want! You all have great healthcare, time we ALL have it!
Thank you Senator!
Stop going on @TheLastWord where they blow you and answer a question @SenFranken
thank you
We must stop McConnell and his Axis of Evil. I am with you. Resist, Obstruct and defend the ACA.
Will watch. Kick ass Al from a Minnesota native tranplanted in Sacramento , Ca. Give them hell!!!!
I am a conservative who left the Republican Party over Trump. There are millions of us. More people are joining us all the time.
Frankenstein the coke head.
Senator, please get me a ticket to your Strand event on Aug 1. Its sold out! :)

FL. You were awesome Mr. Al Franken. Please don't stop fighting for us the 99% of the people
Caught you on The Young Turks tonight! Sorry you didn't have time to answer that one question!
Stuart Smalley sells the American people out again. #BadDem

DID. You talked like a real senator, rationally and with common sense.
Thank you, Sen Al!
Al you're a partisan hack with zero credibility and you'll likely Lose your next election
Tuned in, ur still terrible. U have no ideas except resist. We need help with aca. It's KILLING our paychecks and choice!
Please watch wording..Republicans who vote no to health care aren't "defectors" but patriots who put people before politics.
On it!
Watching you now- how tired we all are ... exhausted!
I will be listening very careful
Or should I say the joke Cruz! Haha
im here waitin 4 ur input...plz just a tad comic relief we need it.
And Mitch publicized it so the base can confuse the meaningless vote as a win for Trump. Thanks for the education, and loved the Cruz joke
Excellent book and it educated me on how things work in Washington. Like today...a meaningless vote to "start a debate" on repeal?
Al, I listened to your book and laugh when I hear "robust" amongst the rhetoric now. It's said so frequently and I never realized it.
Al Help us please.
Ooooh Yeah. Can't Wait
I  love Lawrence. Best newsman on TV.
I can't afford cable. Will it stream? Where?
Yes sir I am in
@SenateDems @TheLastWord @Lawrence show Mitch McConnell this video
Episode 6: "You Have The Right To A Lawyer, But Not To A Doctor." https://youtu.be/8LFS-_nJsnQ  via @YouTube Share w friends in KY, GA,FL,TX,MO!!
Save your breath...you voted this last disaster into law..try writing a comedy script...oh I forgot, you sucked at that too @potus
Let's face the TRUTH... we are all screwed by GOP and an inhumane Health Care System!!
The Rip Van Winkle mom will transpire after 3.5 more years of scandal, corp theft, mass environ destruction, wars, Trumpet family looting...
The lying, secrecy and bullying by our congress and president makes me believe russia is already ruling the US. Terrifying!
American people deserve the same healthcare we provide for you Senators #youworkforus American over lobbyists!
Can't wait 
Love you two!!!
I'm so glad that you are working hard to keep us safe from that lunatic
Are you going to announce your  2020 presidential campaign?
Loved your book. Will definitely watch.
Great! I'll be watching. Can u plz rerun the clip of T reciting #TheSnake  poem. Seems so apropos  #AG
How do u cope w/other side's lack of caring? Their desire 2 WANT to hurt millions so wealthy wallets grow. They seek to harm the vulnerable.
Look forward to it
I just put your book on my Kindle today and planned to turn the TV off and read. Now you go and spoil my plans. Thanks Senator!
Can we. Keep tweeting to fight back!!!
you better believe it!!! lots of work to do!
Hell NO this is corrupt as the Clinton foundation. #maga
If you feel up to running for president, you've got my vote.
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of our country.      You are both good men.    They never took a typing
Class.
So sad....
Yay Senator Al!! Thank you for your persistence and honesty to America!
I would have watched anyways, but the idea of moving forward is compelling.
Better start talking louder, longer Al & tell the other Dems , Trump had 40 K BoyScouts applauding Trump degrading Hillay, Obama, DC ?

Please run for President.
You Betcha, I'll be watching!  #SaveACA #saveMedicaid  #saveAmerica Damn,  #SaveOurDemocracy @TheLastWord  Thank You @SenFranken
What can be done about it when it is completely obvious that the GOP doesn't care how many will die, but that is exactly what they want?!
Wouldn't miss it

Ted Kennedy came back to Congress  to vote to expand HC McCain came back to vote to take it away
Ironic ain't it
#childrenofthecorn = #DemsResist @SenateDems installing fear in general public with manipulate lies & erroneous truth #MAGA #ACARepeal
#SinglePayerNow , show then the Democratic party still stands for the rights of the working class.
Will do!

Yes! Looking forward to it, Senator!
#SaveACA 
#HealthCareVote 
#FrankenforPresident


Write a bill to stop either party from excluding the other on bill writing or law making. Time to grow up work together for America #McCain
i'll b there
I'll be watching. Keep using that mega phone Al. You did a great job on the steps today!
. Single Payer w/ option 2 purchase second, no state boundaries.
His name is Lawrence, right? 

Some day would love to hear the story behind that one
Can't wait 
Medicare for all should be the Dems mantra.
No politicians can have that mantra unless they don't take $ from healthcare industry. It's why they are all silent.
Senator Franken, your Country NEEDS YOU-and a great joke every once and awhile to keep us from sliding into the abyss. 2020?
Cuz he's good enuff, he's smart enuff and doggoneit, we love Al Franken! Come on Al give 'em hell. Ur smarter than all of them!
A GREAT film!!!!

You Bet I will Sen Franken. Please Give me some Peace of Mind today
Forward off the cliff!
Al Franken I may live in PA but you are my favorite Senator.
See you soon.
Hope you have some great plan. Looks like @GOP scored big today.
Why aren't we asking Trump specifics about #trumpcare? He said it's going to be "great" and "spectacular", but has no specifics as to why.
Have you seen ANY of them answer a question.
Not really, but we need to expose them/him. Trump's biggest flaw, is being Donald Trump. He has no policy. No care for the people. Expose it
He walks out of interviews and doesn't hold public press conferences, he's thinks he can rule as an authoritarian
Lion of the Senate, roar!
You go, Senator! Thank you and good luck!
Thank you for your vote today! we appreciate the Dems &Collins & Murkowski standing up for us! thank you!
Are you considering Single payer? Thats really all we wanna know.
