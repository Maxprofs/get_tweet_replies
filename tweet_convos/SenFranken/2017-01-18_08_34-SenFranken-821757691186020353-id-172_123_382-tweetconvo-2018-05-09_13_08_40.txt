That was a disgusting personal attack on Rep. Price.  You obviously live in a special glass house.
Keep standing up for the privileged to get more & more. Your ignorance is astounding.
Your's is even more astounding! Lemming.
Haha, yeah you're not nasty at all. Keep protecting the rich snowflakes, tool.
Oh dear you're a nasty name-caller.
Not angry at all. They're idiots.
Watching you now. What a stupid question. You know how brokerage accounts and mutual funds work.
If you think Price doesn't know exactly where his money is your delusional.
And your nasty, and delusional.
I suppose this is where I call you deplorable?? Why so protective of nominees? Snowflakes?
Call me whatever you want that what y'all do.
lol, that's cute.
That's twice now you've called him a liar. What an ass. Let me guess, you'll close with yet another insult.
The truth is not an insult. The truth just hurts your precious ignorance. Toughen up.
Well aren't you nasty. Typical liberal feeding the stereotype. Have a wonderful afternoon.
As a Minnesotan I can say you are an embarrassment.
Its tough, I think of him as Stewart Smalley. He's a douchebag.
@SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice @YouTube and I watched it you didn't ask any questions you lectured
My private ins. is more money less coverage! I am paying for Obamacare & not on it
Could #DJT be #JFK, RFK, #JFKjr , MLK, CIA revenge. Prayin.
Hey here an idea you make us all suck so we went REPUBLICAN! Now to replace each chair
ask Price if he's also against increased regulation on PP and other reproductive centers if he's against gvnt regs
Franken lives in some kind of demented world that only he and @SenWarren live in.
He comes from Minnesotastan
Trump 15  & 13 interviews met Putin.We know met. VP lying for DT re relationship, both know it.Proof Puppet
NO! CROOKED!
@SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice repeal and replace Obamacare now!
Repeal it and replace it WITH WHAT? The GOP has no plan to "replace" it. Ever.
Make a point Al? You're wandering all over accusing this guy of fraud. Got proof or just mouth?
It's not just Al Franklin.. Price is in hot water for ethics violations, pay attention
According to Schumer? Hahaha! What a hack. Useless Dem.
@SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice @YouTube ***the only way you'd get me to watch u wd be to point a gun at me. Well, maybe not.
no you were about to do what you always do. make a fool of yourself.
#BOZO
These hearings are a joke
Time limits?
Guy is buyin stock he's making legislation on we're talkin bout ?
You don't care about me that's why no longer democrat
< great job. @HHSGov @RepTomPrice <<<  dodging questions and looking uncomfortable, your dishonesty is glaring. @YouTube
You are incredibly rude.
Kudos Sen for speaking out for one of the scared millions of Americans who think this nominee is dangerous
Your complaint about going 1 min over & how the #Benghazi hearings went 11 hours: how about you ask @KrisParonto about his 13 hour battle.
Wow-for a #NonLawyer you sure kicked Legal ass! #ThankYouSenatorFranken #YouDidWellstoneProud
how fitting to have a comedian, go get um Smiley
OMGOSH another Dem who doesn't post his own posts!This post was done while he was already talking!
Does Obamacare actually bend the costs or do you not include the taxpayer money funding subsidies?
Contrast the way @SenatorTimScott asked questions of @RepTomPrice and the way @SenFranken attacked in an underhanded, political way!
Go get him.
Now you're starting to sound like Trump.  I'm also very low energy, right?
@SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice @CNN Inside Trading Is A Crime. Putting Laws in Place to Benefit his Own Stocks=UnClean Hands!
oh you losing a lot of US COLLEGE EDU. DEMOCRATS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT US GOODBYE IDOTS YAP YAP
@SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice @YouTube I guess when you're a failed comedian you go into politics
YOU TOTALLY ROCKED IT, Sen Franken.  THANK YOU for all that you do !
@SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice 
What the hell you know about anything your a washedup
Comic
thank u Senator for firm stance on Trump cabinet pics keep up good work the people need u don't back down
why are you not asking Rice why repeal ACA b 4 a final vetted bill signed into law?
.@RepTomPrice ‘astounded’ by his own “nefarious” profit-taking, insider trading, and corruption https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Evo_5hXp8WE …
@SenFranken @HHSGov
Thank you so much @SenWarren & Franken for fighting for the many millions of Americans covered by ACA.
With that statement it shows that you are grandstanding and there is NO substance to your questions! Phony
please continue to be as bold & thorough as you have been throughout hearings. Fight! #resist
Franken's political career will be over come 2018. I know the people of MN can do much better than him.

This garbage will be remembered in 2020. Right around the corner "senator". Don't count on short memories anymore. Even folks in MN pay attn
The lack of respect your party shows for the office is great. Same lack of respect you show for your constituents. Keep up the great work.
Thank you for caring! Great job!
Hey Stew why not have all you libs stay home for inauguration and paint the empty seats blue? Really drive that message home eh?
http://excellent.one  way long term congresspeople can become multimillionaires>special stock offers on products they oversee
Nice speech, and thanks for reminding the world about how the gov't leaves people to die the Benghazi @SenFranken @HHSGov @RepTomPrice
I guess you were channeling Stuart Smalley. Dreadful.
Q: "Rep. Price, as a MD you claim 2 be anti-cigarettes b/c it kills 180k Americans a year, but u made $300k from tobacco stocks"
Rep. Price, A: "I know every $ spent by Congress, but I don't know where large sums of $ come from in my stock investments."
Al Franken struck gold in Q&A w/hypocritical Tom Price 4 Sec of HHS: Price's wealth in tobacco stocks
Come on 2018 so we can vote the rest of you self important dimwits out. And yet another reason we need term limits.
either you are disconnected or just financially inept. Prem.  not gone up per historic trends, its made up by high deductibles
sop up the foam in the corners of your mouth there Al..."sunlight heals" as TP said - get outside buddy.
Rambling Fool...comedian congressman
Sen. Franken, thank you for bringing the backdoor dealings of Mr. Price to the hearing. #corruption
Transparent corruption is not accountability. #corruption #CorruptionFacts
If @SenFranken is going to give a political speech slandering a @RepTomPrice, then give him time to defend himself for chrissake!
you, Benet, Sanders and the rest of the Dems are shameless! Gotcha? Only the Clintons & democrsts get a pass?
You are a great American thank you
all you can say is same old Democrats stuff which is not true. ACA sucks big time.
We can know of corruption but if we do not press charges and remove from office there is no accountability.
You're such a nasty human being. Dems are interrogating not confirming @realDonaldTrump picks #Shameful #Hater @RepTomPrice
Excellent interview.  Wish you had more time.
Franken is an embarrassment to this whole process. What idiots voted for him and @SenWarren? Shameful.
Price is a disgrace. Lying about his illegal stock trading, lying about Medicare gutting, lying sbout guting medical insurance. DESPICABLE
Vote Franken OUT!!!
terrific questions to Price. His intentions and motives are not in the interest of the voters.
Al Franken. You are a hero.
You poor excuse for a Senator, Benghazi hearing was a bit diff. Spend less time lecturing.#MAGA #TrumpTrain #TrumpInaugural #DTS
"sunshine cures disease" Price says...may be the only form of healthcare middle class can afford!
I'd LOVE to get FREE medical advice, Bennet!
I have been a democrat my whole life but the continued partisanship is embarrassing. Stop it!
In Which a failed comedian doubts the qualifications of an MD to head HHS....
Go Go Go @SenFranken @HHSGov Dr @RepTomPrice is a racketeer. Betting on & profiting from sickness.Let's audit his healthcare billing claims!
Frankin sits there and tries to act intelligent in the hearings, not possible, fool.
you're comparing HHS hearing to Benghazi hearings? You truly are that ignorant.
Then you said #Obamacare kept costs down. WRONG! http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/16/news/economy/health-care-costs-rise-most-in-32years/ …
Funny. Mr. Franken NEVER mentioned the ACA in his latest re-election bid. Never. Says all we need to know.
So proud of you!  You have been a strong voice at the hearings.  Please continue!
Bravo Mr. Price for taking the high road. Franken is a low life trying to make political points. He's a loser
I agree that if you hold public office it's your job to be transparent & know you've invested in tobacco companies @RepTomPrice
Do #s on smoking deaths include Marijuana smokers, Dems support?Govt.gain taxes on tobacco! Scum
Franken you were fraudulently elected in 2008 and you are an unhinged alt-Left clown 
26 year olds are NOT children. Any adult 21 and over should be able to pay their own insurance.  Make it affordable
Will take a peak, thanks for the heads-up.
Mr. Franken you are my hero for today!
What a jerk! Rude liar. You should be ashamed.
You are a hero!
Why aren't you on Obamacare?  Oh, you voted to opt out if it.
So a doctor shouldn't try to make? Too bad you and the rest didn't give a hoot about Clinton  U Socialist
I feel sorry for you!

Guess you'd better find out about your own mutual funds/stocks! You've done nothing in comparison to the Dr
you call that questioning?  I call that political grandstanding and BS.
I love you, man.
THANK YOU for holding @RepTomPrice accountable and being real about this!
good lord, watching the hearing. Almost fell asleep. How did you convince 50+% to vote 4 you?
Go get'em Al. You are rockin it for the country!
Minnesotans KNOW (I'm one) you will bankrupt healthcare organizations if you expand Medicare to everyone. You're nuts!!
Thank you Sen Franken!
- He just looks so smug sitting there
Trying so hard for that gotcha question! You're just embarrassing yourself!
- You're a JOKE Senator, listening to you questioning of Dr Price, you're not credible, hypocrite, nauseating to listen to. Lies
This should be better than Sat Night Live as far as comical.
Thank you! Let's get some real questions answered!
Hearings r on coverage no matter how bad --Dr. Price cares about highest quality care & its priority 4 all!
He's in hot water for unethical behavior already... making millions using his position.
Are we watching the same hearing?  He has devoted his life to bettering care for patients.
You're KILLING IT AL!!!!! GOOD JOB!!!
thank you for your pointed questioning of Price.
Love you Al @SenSchumer @HHSGov @RepTomPrice @YouTube
@SenSchumer  So appreciate your questions, Mr. Franken. Thank you.
you've been the best!
Hope this isn't just "for show". Stop these crazy fuckers from destroying our democracy.
HES SQUIRMING NOW
Ask the tough questions!  Your constituents, and all America, is depending on you.
ohhhhhhhh!!!! KILLING THE GAME RIGHT NOW! GOT'EM!
Always eager for you questions! Thank you for asking the tough ones. Loved your questions for DeVoss too
Don't let up. Ethics-challenged @RepTomPrice needs to hear what Americans think-even non-Trump voters deserve a voice
It all "begs credulity"-his stock deals sound, look & ARE sweetheart deals.We are disgusted. Price:proudly puts the BIZ over patients always
That he dresses up his plan to bolster med biz - where he is wealth lives-as "empowering patients" is most craven, cruel, unethical, absurd
Go get him Senator
there's $$ in tobacco. He doesn't care
u should have streamed the whole hearing. http://greatagain.gov  for info on @RepTomPrice #unity
huh huh uhhh let me go have a smoke and think about it
uh o he needs a smoke.
Thank you Senator Franken!! You make us proud!!
Caan't you make a citizen's arrest instead
This should be humorous.
school him
DON'T LET UP.
please vote NO
give it to him. SHRED HIM
