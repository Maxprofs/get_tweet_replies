8 YEARS LATE CLINTON OBAMA DEMOCRATS SHOULD OF CONFRONTED TRUMP FASCISTS 24/7 WHEN OBAMA WAS IN OFFICE
@SenFranken @SenateDems @SenateGOP
Immigrants experience what Naturalized America does not! They say the oath/pledge. We should say oath to unify again
Thank you for leading opposition to DeVos nomination.
You will never bite the hand that feeds you. And u will fight 4ever to keep poor kids trapped in failing schools.
thank you!!
No wonder kids are so screwed up
    
2 + 2 = 22
@marcylauren @SenateDems Nice try. Thanks. Maybe a little one-on-one persuasion w/your R colleagues would help...
Nice job Stuart. Condemn kids to the failing unions.
thank you!!!
Frankenstein is a turd in the Senate and I wish he'd get flushed. 
#Flushthisturd
Thank you for your efforts. Please don't stop.
Thank you!  We appreciate you taking a stand for our kids.  Too bad our Texas senators aren't doing the right thing.
Don't use our children for your speeches. You do noit believe in Jesus Christ. You even use his name. God Sees You!
but yet you guys just ended up looking stupid and spending your diminished political capital on this...
- THANK YOU for working so hard to protect our children, educators, schools, and education system!
THANK YOU for all you're doing!!
Thank you for your efforts.
@StopLordDampnut @SenateDems Thank you on behalf of my 2 grandchildren that attend public school You speak for them!
@iwanttolearn @SenateDems Thank you, Senator! DeVos would be a DeSaster!
Thank you for your leadership and for the shout-out to my hometown, Warren, MN!
Thanks, now please get ready to do the same for Sessions.
Thank you senator, Franken!  Keep it up the fight fellow dems!
Was it effective?Have we no Republican allies, who understand that we must put educating children first?@SpeakerRyan
Worked harder on obstruction last night than they have on anything important in 8 years. #weak
TY 4 standing against bad nominee for ed sec, & serving constituents appalled she's being considered. #noDevos
just too bad not one more GOPSenator cares about the education of the children of this country.
Thank you for fighting to keep this woman out.
Thanks, Senator Franken! You've been a powerful force for truth & objectivity; we appreciate that!
Yours was one of many great speeches! #NoonDeVos
.#TeachersUnions #SpecialInterestGroups running #FailingPublicSchoolSystem. #Democrats like it that way #DumbedDown
and Americans thank you for putting our children first! Stay strong  #TheResistance
Watching you now on the floor.  Thank you Senator for standing up for American children and families.
To stand up against such profound stupidity and political ass kissing takes a great deal of courage. We applaud you.
So glad you are there and fighting.
Making sure you don't jeopardize that sweet flow of teachers union cash, right Al?
loving you from afar- NJ Mom
Please do not stop the argument. The consequences would be unbearable.
college dropouts has a direct correlation to public education - Think!! #NoOnDeVos.
@BanjoHfuhruhur @SenateDems Education is good. I aced the "Haters" section of my junior high Constitution test...
@DSenFloor @SenateDems Thank you.
After you pocketed how much money from #TeachersUnions ? You should be ashamed.
Thank you Senators, please don't stop! We'll send pizza, just let us know :)
sadly gop does not listen. #noDevos #NoBanNoWall I called #MitchMcConnell
thank you!
That is great but I feel like it won't make a difference in the end.  Winning 2018 mid-terms now becomes essential.
We're proud of you! Can you find one more Republican with a conscience? DeVos would be disaster for schools.
I'm proud of Mr. Senator! Thank you!
thank you for your leadership!
Thank you Senator Franken for standing up for our children and country!
You were so much better at comedy........GO BACK
Thanks AL for your strong vetting of DeVos and Sssions.  MN should be proud to have a Senator with a backbone!!
and this is why we should not pay billions for a wall!
You voted yes on four disastrous cabinet nominees yourself, Sen Franken. Are you capable of taking your own advice?
thank you Dems
Thank you for fighting for our kids!
thank you!
I've been watching you, along with the others... Great job! That woman MUST NOT be confirmed!
THANK YOU!!
thank you for your words. so glad you represent my home state.
you and your party have shown you're unhinged sore losers. DeVos deserves a vote. @VP will break the tie. #youlose
Thank you Sen Franken.  Your questions at the nomination hearing settled the issue for me.  No DeVos!
Thank you! If she gets through, we won't forget.. #2018
I appreciate you fighting for our children
@SenBobCasey @SenToomey watched you on TV last night. You did a great job. I hope Senator Toomey was listening!!!
if she's voted in keep fighting for our students please .
Thank you! Unfortunately, our Texas Senators continue to play partisan politics rather than listen to constituents.
Thanks to you and all the Dems who stood up & spoke for us.Maybe there is 1 Repub who was awakened & will vote NO.
Thank you very much!  I have 2 small kids that will be in public school.
Thank you.  What's your take on how things stand?
Thank you, Senator Franken
@amyklobuchar thanks for standing up for strong schools and quality education! Our students deserve better than @BetsyDeVos
Thank you!
all of Georgia is trying to tell Johnny Isakson to vote no but he isn't listening. Why is that?
I hadn't heard mention of this
No one notice? #DeVos' SoFi Lending had #SuperBowl ad, pushing student loans while Ed. nominee. #holdthefloor @GOP  http://www.superbowlcommercials.co/sofi/ 
but, did it work? Concerned parent. 
Thank you for standing up for public education!
Finland is highly centralized and funded by national government, not local property taxes.
Don't know how it could happen -- federal system, etc. But our system is indeed broken. Try explaining to an international 1/
visitor that local taxes pay for education "But...that guarantees inequality!" Yes. It does. 2/2
Exactly! A Japanese colleague put it perfectly: "Now you know why your students perform so poorly in math & Science."
