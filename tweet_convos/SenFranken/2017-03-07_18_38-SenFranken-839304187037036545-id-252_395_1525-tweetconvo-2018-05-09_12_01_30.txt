Might want to learn how to ask adirect ? so you can get a direct answer. The ? in ? is moronic
you lost the elections get over it  , or else hulk smash confirmations and legislations
and how do you Hulk smash?
you shove with 2 hands regulation down libtards Iran backstabbing democrats
geez we did not realize that!
you're both hacks!
You make me proud 2b a Minnesotan! Great interview! @USAGSessions & his lies will take down swamp cabinet
I feel Al Franken is one of the few politicians I completely trust. He's earned that trust!
laughable you are!
i'd rather put my trust in a businessman. And not a idiot washed up comedian
lol good luck with that!
David Letterman said you're one of the smartest people he's ever met.I'm starting to agree! Franken for prez in 2020? (Please??)
What did they do to you Al? Did you let the senate corrupt you? What are you afraid of? Do they have videos of you too? #Pedogate
are you for real? Smoke and mirrors is all Trump is about.
Go for it, Al! We support your quest for the truth!
God love you Al Franken!!!!!
No, he needs to resign immediately, he obviously lied & shouldn't get a do over.. Please, make it happen
you need to be honest about where your kids go to school (private) while you disavow school choice
Sessions must resign.
sessions needs to resign
Yay!  Love hearing Al's perspective.
Al Franken is my HERO!!
@seanhannity Sessions answered the specific question with a specific answer-"no" how can u jump to any other conclusion-HONEST.
Sessions isn't guilty of perjury but he's guilty of "Making False Statements" to fed officials
Perjury would've been if he intentionally answered directly to your question with a lie
He didn't he offuscated to your direct question & then uttered an unsolicited "FALSE STATEMENT"
that's what I say when ever I sneeze. offoscuse me.
have you told the truth? Nope.
you are not very smart. Read the question asked. He answered honestly
you also asked a hypothetical? From a CNN story I urself said may not even be true. It's insane.
Wikileaks has never been wrong our intel has been. Dem scream no WMD in Iraq our intel said there was.
why didn't u address him not answering the question u asked right then? He didn't lie.
The system is broken.  We have a President who is mentally ill and an Attorney General who perjured himself.
Another honest and candid interview. I'm grateful for your unwavering commitment to our democracy! Thanks
.@SenFranken @GuidepostGroup @TheLastWord @Lawrence  Sen.Franken is so smart, so calm under pressure - thrilled he's here now.
GOP wouldn't know honesty if they tripped over it! Keep their feet 2 the fire; only way is 2 expose them
'cause you're good enough, you're smart and enough, and doggone it, people like you!  Wish you were still funny...
And trying to remember his first name.*Smirks* lol
get to the bottom of this new executive branch crime
Where were you when Hillary lied?
Thank you for digging for the truth! @SenFranken @TheLastWord @Lawrence
I watched. Thanks.
.@SenFranken @TheLastWord @Lawrence Clapper said there was no Russian collusion. You should learn the truth

Keep fighting the good fight Sen. Franken!  We sane people need you and your ilk now more than ever!
if he were, would you be able to see or appreciate it? Seems you've already condemned him.Ur ? was a mess
@jd_Constitution @SenFranken @TheLastWord @Lawrence was Al calling for the last AG to resign or even excuse her self. NO! #ObamaGate
@VP Why do you hate so much. I understand your life is a lie but you can change that. Start telling the truth love will follow.

Excellent interview!!
thank you for ur message. We r looking to u to be a leader in getting to the bottom of trump and Russia!
@niteowl66 @TheLastWord @Lawrence you killed it Al. You always do. Voice of reason and logic. Thank you!!
Holder & Lynch will do well if any invest needs to b whitewashed.
Let's appoint Holder or Lynch. Hands up don't shoot. Contempt. Meet with Billy. DOJ slush fund.
The oath was to tell the whole truth, which he also took as a senator to protect the Constitution too!.
Ha! You asked Sesdions if he met with Russians to discuss camoaign, he said no.
Al. 
Sen Franken.
Thank you for getting to where we need to go 
W/kindness.
I admire both of you MEN! Now that's what men do, tell the truth!
I feel so grateful for your presence in the senate, Al. We need smart folks like you to save our country
Well, you failed America calling it Perjury - not your call.
Stop persecuting and Demand evidence/Proof
How can he claim he was not speaking about campaign-related communications, given the question? Crazy.
You absolutely ROCK!






Jeff "papa smurf" sessions was not asked if he had communication with Russians. He volunteered to deny it

You & Lawrence were great. Thanks.
AG Sessions,such an HONORABLE MAN, WE'RE DISGUSTED AT THIS SEDITION AGAINST THE NEW ADMIN,ASHAMED OF DEMS
Franken for President
how in the world did U become a senator, and U think U can back sessions into a corner that's comedy
Then you be honest and tell America your Global elite sell out America plan..picture of u in article
Keep it up Al!
welcome to the "new" Al Franken decade!
I love that Al is speaking so straight forward about Sessions.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For fighting the good fight, for speaking #truth, for continuing to be a true leader.
After 2020, hopefully, you'll be in the White House and we can sleep without nightly presidential tweets.
while you're at it explain the donation from the Podesta Russian group jackass!!
I'm glad you emphasized that Sessions answered a question you didn't ask, and it's on record.
Great job today Senator & Great job tonight!  Thank you for all you do for our Country!
Perfect response from a perfect lunatic. Back to your bunker, guns and bibles please.
was Al calling for the last AG to resign or even excuse her self. NO! #ObamaGate
Thank you for all you do. Please do not give up on the Trump/Russian investigation. You are the Best.
why you not honest your self you know it
Thank you a Senator Franken!  #awesomeness
@bonnie_london @TheLastWord @Lawrence Sally Yates perhaps
TY 4 continuously tightening the thumbscrews on this cadre of grifters, liars, thieves and extortionists!
@Kare_P @TheLastWord @Lawrence By that you mean partisan right?
@adirado29 @TheLastWord @Lawrence your questions have been spot on
But I am a comedian no one takes me serious
thank you Senator.
Sessions is terrible at sleight of hand. He's a fumbler, lousy dancer, bad listener. And a crap lawyer.
In other words .@SenFranken nobody's gonna  see you .@TheLastWord .@Lawrence
#SessionsMustResign
Seriously?! Why can't you get this HEINOUS AG impeached & removed? We want him out & expect it!
You let that Grassley off too easy. "Gotcha" shouldn't be a worry of an honest man.
please Sen. Invoke the 25th amendment! #TrumpLies#TrumpTaxes#SessionsLies#FlynnLies#Manafort#russians
Great interview w/Lawrence O. Keep after the truth!
I watched it. Keep on pushing like you are doig. Thanks for being the good guy
why are you trying so hard to not declare the Sessions lied and committed perjury?
Al- As a lifelong Republican, I applaud your unwavering concentration on Trump/Sessions untruths. Go!
I'm so thankful @senfranken gave up comedy for something truly hysterical -- politics. Just sad won't ever be a Franken-Davis ticket.
UR 1of the few I trust. If collusion found 2B true, can U say what would happen? Throw out whole White House? Who is next pres.?
please don't ever throw in the towel on the effort to get to the bottom of it!
still you are funny take this orenge monkey out of WH please

.@SenFranken @TheLastWord @Lawrence Thank you for your service to all Americans!
I think the Russians are using @twitter a lot, like @POTUS and manipulating #stockmarket.
.@SenFranken @TheLastWord @Lawrence @ChuckGrassley kept Mrs. King’s letter in a @senjudiciary drawer & @WaPo had to file FOIA req to get it
you are my absolute favorite senator. Thank you for actually working for the people.
Yes, Sessions perjured himself. And no, he can't continue as AG. 100% discredits DOJ, & dishonors AUSAs.
[Sessions didn't lie, he said he didn't meet any of the Russian about the election. Thats what you asked.
but if he can't prove he's innocent, lick that pos up for perjury!
Thank you Senator Franken!!!
@adirado29 @TheLastWord @Lawrence so glad you represent us here in Minnesota...so happy with both of Minnesota's senators!
why can't you call a spade a spade? Tell Sessions he's a liar! If he proves (ha)his innocence,apologize!
sessions also needs to explain why he didn't know about the other four trump surrogates who met w/kislyak
I am so glad you are who & where you are! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! #LastWord #TheResistance
Yeah, don't hold your breath that he'll cross the thin red line.
Thank you!!!  A senator that cares about our country! Sessions is a liar. Perjury!
the fact that Sessions wouldn't have recused himself if wasn't caught...
I'm with you... why are we tip toeing around Sessions... numerous Russian contacts
Don't stay up too late, Senator. You've got the hotdish competition tomorrow.
Hi Al!  You are wrong.
Thank you! You're right, Sessions should come back to testify & explain himself.
You are just great  and thank you!
expecting a lot from someone that was appointed by #rump #trump #resignunder100days #cnn #1a #piersmorgan
I am proud of the work you are doing Senator Franken. Thank you,
I'm an Iowan thinking of moving to MN just because of Frankin @SenatorCharles @SenJoniErnst
sen Franken you are AWESOME!!!!
Why Not Me?  Yeah.  Why the hell not you?  Al in '20
Keep the pressure on.
You are my hero!
great job in the hearing today Senator!
Sen Franken, You A true Patriot and I admire you so much. Thank you for OUR Truths
Should that not start with the entire DNC ?

Thank you for speaking on behalf of the majority of Americans who are behind you and grateful.
, do ask @SenFranken:

"Will you ever go on Saturday Night Live?"
Yes?: "as 'host' or skit?"
Sessions can't be working 4 White House,it needs to be independent &Sessions lying doesn't meet that test
I'm watching.Sessions needs to resign. of great importance to keep White House and justice dept separate
Just like Holder and Lynch were.
thank you for your courage and intelligence Senator!
The guy who's supposed to prosecute people who lie under oath, is a documented LIAR under oath.
please move for impeachment @TheLastWord @Lawrence
thank you for fighting for Minnesotans!  So proud that you're my Senator!
Thnx 4your questioning of cabinet noms. DeVos, Carson, Perry totally unqualified. Most of rest sleazy.
whoot!  whoot!
He lied. He sought to decieve you & congress. Senator
Yeah, we all felt he was lying about something at the time. Now we know exactly what it was he lied about. Hope his mama's proud
No "Gotcha" questions tonight!  :)  You were great today!
Please I beg you get trump out of office into obscurity. He's a horror story & global embarrassment.
There's no need to be honest now!! He already lied!! #mustresignnow
Love you, Al.       Mound, MN
I was so impressed today with your honesty and your ability to be forthright thank you
Blah blah blah - do something
#congressional #perjury is a #felony
