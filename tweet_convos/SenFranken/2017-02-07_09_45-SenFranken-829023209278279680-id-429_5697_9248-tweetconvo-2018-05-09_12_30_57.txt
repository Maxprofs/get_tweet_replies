@Lynn_Henning also shame that senate Dems spent more time on #Devos then #Sessions who is more dangerous as AG #TeacherUnions
Kevin: No. Not more time. She simply blew her hearing, making a vote for her untenable. Had zero to do with "unions."
I am not a supporter of hers  and yes she had terrible  hearing but I am sorry my friend had MUCH to do w/ unions
No, Kevin: It had MUCH to do with teachers, union or non-union. They know this is the last person to be heading Education.
ok  agree to disagree   Teacher unions very powerful lobby for Dems- all of the above can be true
A powerful and necessary lobby. Teachers are overworked, under-thanked, under-paid, and blamed for all shortcomings. Endlessly.
not what I was saying -  of course teachers are underworked and underpaid- I am simply pointing out a political reality in DC
Seems people accept the DeVoses of the world and their direct financing of Senators, but a teacher's union gets 'em all worked up.
Every senator who voted Yes should be required to have their children and grandchildren placed in public school.
public schools aren't a punishment
not yet.  But soon.
I refuse to have my classroom be a punishment. I will always work to educate and help my students
I hope you dont think I want public schools to be a punishment. I fear devos will lead it down that path
Not at all! I fear the same. I'm just taking a stand as a future teacher.
thank you!  If not for wonderful public schools I wouldn't be where I am.
Me too!
Does it matter who Trump's Cabinet pick for Education is? The whole dept. will be privatized before elimination.
Yes, GA David Perdue sold out the children's educ for a mere 23K
GOP didn't confirm her to run it, they want her to dismantle it.  Rep. Massie introduced legislation to abolish department..
DeVos is a disaster! One moe example  of GOP Pres.&GOP Congress Destruction of USA foundation needed for educated citizens
Thank you for displaying intelligence and honor in the face of genuine hypocrisy.
@Kaygirl8Lawana  DeVos is against Pub.Ed K thru HigherEd(GOPGoal)Central2American Dream!Website 4 Disabled Kids eliminated (1
I agree! Thanks for all you and The DNC's help
u can't possibly believe the GOP cares nothing about education, and frankly it's a breath of fresh air to see non politicians
thank you for being a voice of reason
You keep up the good fight, Senator. I love watching you in action going for 45's nominees. Each 1 hand picked to be worst ever.
Thank you, Senator, for your fight. It will be remembered, even by those of us who aren't your constituent.
A shame yes, but definitely not a surprise. 
Shrug. Speaking of "major donors," Senator, didn't  teachers unions contribute about $20 million to Democrats?
Do you have an actual point? Does that improve DeVos' competence? I think not.She's still a horrible choice for ED
Isn't the point obvious? He thinks GOP approved her due to money: is it  possible Dems opposed her due to money?
No. Nope. I think they watched her confirmation hearings, read her plagiarized answers, researched her shitty...
...results in MI, and decided a blind dog could do a better job.
@amyklobuchar Thank you for fighting for education.
you've already tweeted it's not new anymore
Need to identify all republican donors show up at there homes, business. Let people know they buy votes.
@sixuntilme confusion
Give her a break! You don't know what she will do & she just wants what is best for our children.
FRANKEN 2020
teacher unions almost exclusively vote for dems, who turn around and vote to give more money to teacher unions- support that?
maybe a run for President?
Doesnt that tell you how much she CARES about our education system?!!!
Thank you, @SenFranken.  All the rest of us can do now is pay attention to our school board elections to make sure our schools are OK.
But you had no problem w #ClintonFoundation accepting all those donations did you?
Deb why don't you send me link to what you are referring too.
Here is one article I read:  http://ln.is/washingtontimes.com/LYZGE …  There are a number of articles about the Clinton Foundation
you gave it a good go. Keep up the good work.
it says it all!  We have to give them a fight to the finish!  They cannot silence dems.


The money Devos contributed to their campaigns.
Senate's vote is for sale  I thought the ppl's senate was supposed to put the puplic interests before lining their own pockets
#GOP demonstrating how gov't is dysfunctional & terrible by taking calculated steps to make it more dysfunctional & terrible
@CarlaMoulton3 Not a shame it's a crime, "donations" bribery put it how you want legally, it's payment for vote, #GoPISStealing
@granisnark12 Keep dividing, Sir
@LindaCollins11 there are 700 more offices to be filled in the top bureaucracy. It will be staffed by political operatives.
If this were any other country, the US Gov. would be crying foul, citing absence of due process and claiming corruption.
our new America will erupt into a revolution and it will be ugly.
"Knowledge is power" is currently at war with "Ignorance is bliss." And ignorance is winning.
why r u just now concerned about our children?  Dem controlled city schools are a mess.  Should we just continue to throw $ atit
Thank you for fighting for all of America's children! We are with you!
Maybe it's because #America is now run by #Fascist #DictatorTrump , #Russia, #PresidentBannon, #SwampCabinet, & #corrupt @GOP???
yeah like our senators look out for anyone but themselves, that includes both sides. You all suck
@ezlusztig 

It is not just shameful.  It is corrupt.
Keep up the fight! Y'all did everything possible. Hope we win this next one. You have support! What can we do right now to help?
Please run in 2020, not many Dems I can trust nowadays either
@ezlusztig hey we now live in a world of alternative facts one that says no one on Capitol Hill give a shit
Shame? NO

#Democracy doesn't live without #ChecksAndBalances. @FEC no longer tries. #SCOTUS no longer cares. #Bye #US #Democracy.
@Slate @JoeConason @MaddowBlog 

Isn't this sort of what that Blago guy in Chicago went to jail over?
not surprising though.. they deny climate change and all environmental concerns which we equally impact welfare of our children!
@lisalocicerogh  when the population is uneducated it is easier to repress facts
@SenateGOP is a complete sell out bunch of traitors
- @ProperManors Teacher #TameraBroskette loves you both. Some thoughts & pic from her for you: http://propermanors.tv/blog/dick-tater-2017/ …
political whores selling their vote.
I would like to suggest Senator that you run for President in 2020. I will campaign for you and support you 100%
Hard to believe that some will choose political party over what's best for our children. The children lose.

this surprises you?!
@LifeatGnome    Stowe it
Donor sorta rhymes with moron. Makes sense #noDevos
because you believe in the choice to kill children, but not to educate them.
thank you for your hard work to protect us
Clearly bought and paid for...Disgraceful
it's more like a travesty.  Please start the process to remove trump
Thanks for your support for children across the US, as well as public schools. So disappointed in our Senate today.
@clementinesford I can't believe we pay for this shit show.
Senator Franken, we need more senators and representatives like yourself, someone who truly cares and looks out for the people
Their children aren't filthy poors who have to rely on the gov't like leeches.
As opposed to voting to continue supporting teachers unions at expense of students because kids don't pay dues to donate to Dems
we'll get em' next time Al!
DeVos just bought her very own Department of Education, she can't wait to start educating us on the value of buying republicans
.@SenFranken @BetsyDeVos 

Us Mama Bears gonna make the grizzlies look like kittens! #Resist #StrongerTogether #SpeakUpRiseUp #Indivisible
@BooRadleyHere here is colorado's response to @SenCoryGardner
We appreciate ypur efforts to stop her Senator, thank you for hearing us. Keep up the good work.
@jasoncabinda r u f ING kidding me thinking dems look out for children?  Teachers unions over innner city poor kids all day long
All we can do is follow the money trail because thats whats important to him and his gang. He doesn't care about the other 98%
And his 3rd worked without a work visa. Where does he draw his lines ? In the sand so he easily erase them as needed !
. I guess we can all go back where we came from but most of us are mixes of many countries now so we'll need that geneology test
What nationality is Drumpf (Trumps real name) His first wife wasn't a citizen until she was married to him for about 11years.
Thank you for trying so hard. I wouldn't be able to speak to my Republican colleagues if I were you. They are out of control.
I'm ashamed of the president and all his beleifs and all those he's appointed. We are the next immigrants. But his wives stay ?
@venividireliqu1 
Really Al?
@ZellaQuixote maybe the wrong swamp was drained.
BTW, when can we have new outlets drop the former SNL writer part?  You've accomplished so much!
Thank-you for trying so hard!

Another Dem cry baby !! 
all.
Republicans are useless to the Democracy. They put their money and greed ahead of the American people. It is time to fire them
@marymancini @BetsyDeVos is beyond unqualified
Thanks for standing up for our children.
Protect our kids. #BeABear
thank you, senator for doing what is right. 

Keep fighting the good fight. 

Minnesota believes in you!
thank you for fighting for us, Al!
a shame that you guys couldn't bring another republican to his senses.
Actually
Its all about 48 Democrats voting for unions over 
a decent education for poor kids.
Again and again they prove that, to them, neither our children nor the working class matter.
@Millennial_Dems GOP hates kids and education
Thank you for being a voice for our children.
You obviously don't share the same view as many, if not most, Americans who don't trust the statist status quo #NotBigGovernment
Thank you for being a voice and advocate for all children.
Sad that $$ are now the new moral standard under this administration.
American kids lose, GOP put profits B4 kids, way to go senators! I will do EVERYTHING I can to unseat GOP come re-election time!
agree, greedy, corrupt, and perverted is the Trump trade mark, the agenda for Trump is to look after the rich, wake up AMERICA
Thank you for helping lead the fight. More fights to come. #RESISTANCE not appeasement.
just an appalling use of patronage not seen since Ulysses S. Grant's administration.
yup!
thank you for being a voice I can believe in
#DeVos and my parrot both can talk, but neither are qualified. P.S. My parrot is the smarter of the two.
@ColinKahl GOP is only about the wealthy & Corporations. All others, especially our kids, aren't important.
its a shame our dems don't go to work& look out for Americans.instead they undermine our morals-theres a lesson
Learned a lot about politics & the influence of money with this nomination.
Plan to use what I've learned in the next election!
Thank you Senator Franken for fighting for children. #wewontforget
Thank you so much for all you did and undoubtedly will continue to do to fight for our schools and children.
@SunshinePearl . Standards are now just a liberal conspiracy
@southerntalker I think the Republicans have now officially earned the title of the "pussy party" by voting for DeVos.

Tragic.....she is the most unqualified and unfit candidate I have ever seen.
Talk about shame: Remember this?  ‘I give pills to Lesley Stahl. & when Lesley’s passed out I take her to the closet & rape her’
@cherokeesher2
GOP continues it's smash and grab strategy because they know demographics are against the and the window will close. Take heart!
they are traitorous scumbags. it
@personalitty Stop session and Price. You got to stop price
Thank you for working hard against her confirmation. The battle continues.
Give her a chance.  Our public school system sucks ass!
@melissagarrison why does she even want this job?  It's not going to make her richer, she has no history of helping kids! WTF?
I'm not a constituent of yours, but I often donate to your campaigns, because I know I can count on you to speak for me. <3
& @Amyklobuchar care so much about children ... that they abort everyone they can ... late term ... post term ...
GOP=shameful. If not country b4 party, then at least kids b4 party, you'd think? What will become of us, @SenFranken ?
DeVos is not good enough, not smart enough and G-d dammit no one likes her. #DeVosvote #devos
@ColinKahl  this is a very sad day for the children of the United States of America 
@theBlue_Falcon We need 2b marching on all Repubs NOW a& demand that they do their job & uphold US Constitution & #IMPEACHTRUMP
Thank you, Sen. Franken. You’re good enough. You’re smart enough. People like you. :) Fight on!
well we know whySwamp Full!
Shameful, and a loss.  I am grateful to you and other senators continuing to fight for what is right, pls, keep pressing on.
at times its best to let Gluttons eat like in Monty Python's Meaning of life. Give them another cracker. Let them go too far.
@treynolds_42 I'm pulling for you in 2020. Please consider running for POTUS #franken2020
yeah cause Arnie Duncan was such an independent and not close friend with Obama. #history #hypocrisy
Thank you, and ALL Democrats, for trying to save American Education. Shame shame shame on the Republicans. #ShameOnThem
now let the war of the memes begin!
@amoobrasil GOP will pay 4 this in elections. We r voting them ALL out! Screwed up BIG this time! Didn't listen to constituents.
It's feeling kinda swampy at the White House.
TY for working to defeat DEVOS! Your intelligence and caring was obvious. Now, #NoOnSessions, #ReleaseYourTaxes, #invest Hacking
you r a Shameful xcuse for a public servant! Why don't u come and help me shovel my driveway
Thank you for your vote and efforts to persuade colleagues. If Senate is a rubber stamp, they aren't doing Constitutional duty.
@brazil_patricia they supported an unqualified president. An unqualified Cabinet is an expectation.
These Republicans are backing the child Trump.Come election time they must be beaten.
Don't Look Baby...This Is Not America! 
This is The Pay For Swamp That *45 Brought To Shame America's White House!
Astounding outcry by the people to reject & still the unfortunate powers that be do not listen.It's only about the money.
They need to dumb America down to their level of uneducation @CherokeeNative3
@dr_w83 It's hilarious she so obviously bought this job. $ talks. Too bad it didn't answer her questions while she was vetted.
She's never seen a public school 
.@SenFranken @beining_re not their children
Thank you for fighting for my son. He matters, too. Without IDEA and public school services, we would be lost.
I am a Conservative who voted for Trump and this is a Travesty. I will  vote for you in the Next Presidential Election.
@SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio And the Republicans continue on w/ their dumbing down of America agenda w/ @BetsyDeVos confirmation.
we need to take back the house in 18. This is disgusting. The majority of his cabinet is a reward position for $. Bribery!!
@MableGertrude but that's okay, because she's good enough,  smart  enough and doggone it, people like her!
@EllenMorris1222 Al, this #GOP acceptance of lies and corruption is beginning to look like complete dismantle of Democracy?
A shame, but not surprising. When they see that other nations children are smarter, "why?!?" "We chose our pockets, remember?" 
then every Senator who benefitted from her $$$ should not have voted!
thank you for fighting so hard. 
Thank u & all members who stood up for America"s children.  We will not forget.  Our voices will be heard in our votes.
So much for the future of our nation as this move will surely result in generations of citizens dumb as a box of Trumps, sigh...
@lovebscott? yes what is going to happen to a special needs kids
Thank you (& @amyklobuchar ) for doing the right thing in opposing this travesty.
are you sincerely surprised by any of them?  McCain maybe?
you mean an organization promoted someone who donated lots of money to their cause? Never seen this before.. (they all do it)
Not all of them, however, have spent their lives trying to tear down the institutions they are now being put in charge of.
Sure-but this is like looking at two wrecked houses: one w/only a door left, the other w/a window while we pick - good luck
You are talking about the entire state of American politics. I am talking about one asinine & potentially disastrous appointment

We will march in the street until every last one is out of office
thank you for being upstanding
@realDonaldTrump what do you know about poverty? How a hot lunch & knowledge may be ALL a child has to rise to better? FURIOUS!
I nominate you for president in 2020
they only want rich kids smart. the others can be used for cheap labor!
@realDonaldTrump This whole administration is a joke.  President Bannon is so happy right now he had Don make that tweet.
