Mnuchin is example of @POTUS pulling one over on voters who elected him by stocking Cabinet, Admin with people who want to put banks first.
I’ll be voting no on Mnuchin this evening. And I have suggestions for @POTUS if he really wants to drain the swamp. https://www.facebook.com/senatoralfranken/posts/1261420543943825 …
He could try to stop filling it with alligators, for a start.
Tru dat. Keep digging. It's dirty under there.
Seriously, who is LEFT to run GoldmanSachs? Everyone now runs the WH!
I know. They should all be exposed. (I'm neither R nor D, partisan finger pointing doesn't work on me.)
could be known as formerly AirAmerican failed talk show host.
AL FRANKEN, YOU & DEMOCRATS/LIBERALS HAVE TO STOP THE CRAP YOU'RE PUTTING AMERICANS THROUGH! YOU'RE SIMPLY A DISCRACE!
Well if you expect Goldman Sachs cabinet to change the direction of job creation and living wage, please pray hard!
And they bitched about Hillary and Goldman Sachs
oh Geez. Whst about draining the swamp
.You #CrazyDemocrats are going into #Oblivion in 2018. #WeThePeople are #MadAsHell at the #Obstruction #Lies #Heresy #DoubleTalk
but the emails...
@TmcuseoCuseo Goldman Sachs cabinet recalls the Trump's criticism of Hillary for making a speech. I feel sorry for the trumpets.
#GivingGovernmentBackToThePeople

Yes and we need them ALL out so get a Special Prosecutor and get trump investigated and out. #resist
Goldman Sachs are ubiquitous. And almost always "win". @economicsNZ
the house always wins.
be our next pres
we love you Al, keep talking
Stay on their ass Al! #CorruptTrump #impeach
It's President Trump, Senator
A joke! Mr. Franken, you're like Batman putting the cowl back on.
so as a comedian were u qualified to represent the Democratic Party? Seems like a great fit with the democratic fools
It was different back then!  Lol
Keep up the great work, I live in AZ.... all I can say is I hope 2018 will bring CHANGE!!!
Drain the swamp!
my deepest regret is not living in your district so I can vote for you! Keep fighting the good fight! 
Trump admin is all doublespeak. Say they'll #DraintheSwamp, really mean they'll fill it - with a happy assist from GOP congress.

I still say it's not a cabinet but a board of directors.
sad and getting sadder...
coming from this guy, brain addled by Peruvian products?
I'd rather have that comedian than the Joker in the White House, who just wants to watch the World burn.
for sure.
tell me what swamp he's draining again?!?
The Trump team could even more easily be called the Admin that "formally sucks." There, fixed it for ya, Sen. Franken
I call them the Turd Reich.
Swamp?  What swamp?
@JonHutson Thank you Senator Franken for standing firm on this terrible nominee
he's putting in ppl  know what they r doing u couldn't get it right b4 So much 4 working 2gether smartest minds u cut them down!

I wish I could say that I'm surprised
@OHenryHernandez Government Sachs as known by Bush administration
Post 2008 we were all lulled into believing 'Government Sachs' had likely ending thr run. Clearly not. "Double-Down" new mantra.
What can we do though? A republican congressman isn't going to care about my vote, knowing they wouldn't have it anyhow 
Atta Boy! Thank You!
When is Enough ENOUGH !!
or soon all called Russian agents.
Trump's team is everything he said it would not be! iamthemimi65
Trump wine at liquors stores. Yes I realize it is Monday.
give Goldman Sachs a break. They offer accounts with $1 opening and 1.05 interest. Beating othr banks 
And the Admin currently known as Russian Influenced.
He drained the swamp into his own cabinet. Bought and paid for. Ugh.
Our government has been Government Sachs for decades. Neoliberalism is why so many are turning to Democratic Socialism. Try it.

So what do you intend to do about that, Sir?
I amn curios abour your answer too!
the oval, however, can't be described in such generous terms
Clearly those who voted for Mr. Trump do not care that he lied to them regarding Goldman Sachs and so many other things. SAD
he's doing EVERYTHING she said he would & putting the ppl he needs 2 make it happen He signed no lobbying order
they are just going with a the symbol tho
.@SenFranken leading a country formerly known as America.... disgusted
Frustrating that someone who has violated laws gets this position.
Government Sachs
