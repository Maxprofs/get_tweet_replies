Americans deserve an attorney general who can separate fact from fiction and speak truth to power. @SenatorSessions is not that person.
@DrDinD @SenatorSessions dems grill in front of cameras then vote yes behind vlosed doors. #traitors
no they did not. They voted against sessions
shuner voted yes on 3 noms do far
yes out in the open. I agree they should oppose all but a case can be made for some worse than others & for not going 100% oppo
i know u r probably right but....feeling scared 2day
why is the @MSNBC @CNNPolitics  news all about LEAKS ?? All we care about is WHAT WAS LEAKED.  Stop falling for Don's tricks!!
@peterframpton learn the enemy of freedom > Why We Are Afraid, A 1400 Year Secret, by Dr Bill Warner http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/lKDVW …
Al, a good first step, but we need to fight on the beaches, in the streets, in every home in America. Aux Barricades!
I agree they aren't playing by the rules this country has in place to keep our country free. We need to escalate it
Absolutely 100% right. Obama was reasonable, he got nothing from it.
it's time to make America, America again. The southern KKK thugs in office are overthrowing this government
you damn straight,  it's hopefully waking up some of the Republicans that still care about this country
@Trumpnado2016 @WhiteHouse is the new #ANIMALHOUSE! The movie will be yuuuuuge with the highest ratings ever!!!
@AprilDRyan Because he's crazy.
Amazing work today, Senator.  Please keep it going.  Thank you.
Yes great work! Keep it up! I hope you run for President next time.
I'm a Trump supporter but do think Al Franken would be a good candidates for Democrat party..
You, spread lies! Trump tells us the truth, good or bad! We believe that their is Huge Voter Fraud & it needs to be stopped!
Pretty sure Southwest ran a two-vote fare on Nov. 8 so people could fly between states if they could prove they voted twice.
@peterframpton 3three things you probably didnt know about islam  http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/hU8Rq …
Islam does not recognizes womens right

@SenateDems yes i agree Thank you..his grown children are getting free plan rides that we pay taxes for Air Force 1
Yes Senator you tell them.
, you know pesticides kill #bees. Why don't you write a bill banning #pesticides? It may pass-- worth a try. RT RT
Pedofillia is a huge part of Islam .Ignorance of Islam will destroy our society
you're a FOOL
Electronic voting is hard to prove. But I heard Pres Obama condoning illegal voting with a latina actress.
You are good enough; you are smart enough; and, doggone, we really NEED you right now.
Here's the problem... Obama encouraged illegal voting before election https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCLO0WBvhF8 … #MAGA #infowars
Thank you.  Where are the other Democrats?  We will remember them. If you guys think we're playing, think again.
I'd totally vote for you If you ran in the next presidential election, just saying

@peterframpton Know thine enemy >> http://ln.is/blogspot.com/i8TOh …
@Nupe117 thank you.
then let's also investigate the mere 77k votes that won the electoral college. Who's the joke?
good luck, your logic doesn't cut the 'mustard'.  Enjoy your cult leader as you believe every dribble about of his mouth.
@Newyorker2212 Love you Sen Franken. One of the few Dems to call it like it is.
@toastedalmond22 whose job was it to call out Obama about the lie about keeping your doctor. #alternativefact
The truth about voter fraud is the election fraud that caused & created it, See https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8ciOFtydRP5eko4d2RlVGdWem8&export=download …
But he'll get fired! Or tweeted at. That's scary!
you are doing kick-ass job. Keep up the great work!
so question remains w Sessions as AG call POTUS out on this or w he simply ignore this hyperbole as Twitter Talk? #factsmatter
Like WMD?
Didn't you jus admit there are lots of people registered to vote in more than 1 state? Isn't that the point of an investigation?
@louvice Good luck with that if Sen Sessions will be AG.
Seen him 4 Years> Putting on a Great Acting Job. God Save USA
how are you still here? If any President can find the voter fraud you have looked the other way for years he can and will!
@AprilDRyan President Trump must continue to be challenged when he tells lies, and so should his surrogates and staff.
address #ElectionFraud in the tally code. Insist on validating election results w/2X verify & paper copies
see http://Michigan.gov  MI 2010 GEN database logic = wide open 4 fraud Confirm not nationwide problem
@Jpdawe7 What happened to the voter fraud investigation Trump said he was going to begin?
@AprilDRyan
TRANSLATION: "Alternative facts," is what we used to refer to as, "Talking out of your *ss."
. Who appoints attorney general?
YOU ROCK!! #NoSessions @MMFlint @MarkRuffalo @SenWarren @timkaine #CallOutTrump #TrumpLies #voterfraud #Resist
@pseudosudio you're a rock star Senator Franken!
Let me help you Stuart; Detroit, this year, Google it. Jack-ass.
@LeslieMarshall It is the job of the Attorney General to do their job. We the People pay the salary. Our Govt. Our money.
@PoliticalBee whose job is it when he lies about it raining? How about his staff making up massacres? Any of these your job?
And it's your job to vote NO on Sessions,  DeVos, & Price. And don't forget to demand @realDonaldTrump release full tax returns!
@2020fight Senator....how about a run for President in 2020? We need someone like you to stand up to this bullshit!
help us !!
Dear Sen. Franken. Heroics of sanity are needed now. Stand strong 
right on! Keep fighting for us we need you!!!
why are you the only one saying anything about all the lies. Why won't anyone else? Why does no one care?
Thank you, Senator.
you're not my senator but I love you! Keep fighting for the American people.
@Politics_PR they impeached B. Clinton for lies abt oral sex. @realDonaldTrump's are MUCH bigger.

So when do hearings start AL?
thank you
http://ln.is/www.youtube.com/CX18O …
!!!!!
it is also the duty of the attorney general and the justice dept. to investigate an allegation.
@frany3 Yep but he fires them ha lol
@granny_st liar in chief
thank you Sen Franken. Keep the pressure on! #resist
every1 needs to inundate elected republican officials and DEMAND they stop out of control White House b4 untold damage is done
@Robin69262653 AL, You lost your point when you backed trumps picks. You are the problem. The DNC needs to whither and dry up.
Who the hell told you to speed it up? Some brown nose ass kissing Trump-luver? Tell him you'll take all the fricken time u want!
@marcylauren Can we stop referring to him as "President"? A simple "Trump" should do if we want to be polite.
.@SenatorSessions Do you have the courage to tell .@realDonaldTrump that he is lying? If no affirmative answer, step down! .@SenFranken
I saw this whole speech. Al Rocked it!
Thank you!
Thank you for standing up to kleptocracy!!! @jackhutton

Fixing VA is 1 of many reasons i voted for Trump VA Sucks i Know it Does give a person Job & tell em they cant be fired Yeah NOT

I love him! Did you see him blasting the fuck out of Creepy Cruz?
Yeppers. C-SPAN for the win!
Who's job is it to #Remove45andBannon Who's job is it to stop #45Carnage. Obviously not the leaders or the voters. #RiggedGame
Know how much we cherish the uncommon amalgam of goodies you  Bring!!!
Please filibuster the Supreme Court nom. Also call to order a vote on every appointment. Play dirty like the Reps did Obama.
Trumps answer to anyone challenging him is to fire them. She did her job & he didn't like being called out. I support her.
But didn't Trump just hire some idiot to do that? Impeach this man and all he hired, include Pence in that, too.
Why did you lose your composure when Cruz entered??? You are a POS!
If Staff call out Mien Kampf Trump they will be fired or disappear like Putin does!Typical Dictators!
FOOL Trump-he wins yet he DEMANDS MORE VALIDATION!!!! INSANE LUNATIC!!
@lloyd_t_spencer; But he won't; #JeffSessions will HELP that #MoronInChief aka #Trump undermine ALL R DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS!
please be relentless on the GOP !!
Thank you for your hard work in DC working for the people!!
Why have you voted for the last 5 of 6 Trump nominees? Will you continue to support his Nazi agenda?!
@franksnstein You Go @SenFranken Thy'll have a lot of objections now but whn they were doin crooked it to @POTUS44 no objections
@ntvnyr173 Frankin is a P
he's such a liar and a libtard dirtbag
AL Franken for President! :)
Thank you! Keep fighting. #resist
really that why project veritas has proof. That's why dead ppl are voting that's why ppl are registered in more than 1 state!
thank you, sir!
Next sound you hear, is every elected Republican rolling on the floor laughing out loud at you on that !!!

@severud relying in this administration to behave with integrity is a excercise in necessary futility. Time will come for others
thank you for trying to protect our country.
I love this man..as I am now old I will only be able to bake him cookies to prove it..gotta great soft gingerbread recipe AL!!!!
@WiccanMethusela there was voter fraud; perpetrated by DJT, PUTIN, & RNC
you are my hero. Thats my daily affirmation for u
@clarencehilljr but there is massive voter fraud. How does Philadelphia have 12 million registered voters & get 14 million votes
@brownsugar7878 iIs the job of the senate to call out voter suppression too.  Where were you?
remember the Black Box stuff from 2004? I find it curious that Trump won by a small string of key districts. Just a thought.
won't even investigate it
Lies and the Lying Liars was great, too.
I was an Air American fan. I still admire you.
whose job is it to make sure inadequate house reps do their homework before flapping their gums? Oh he's a senator?
@Rosie but he fires those guys!!
yeah, good luck with that now. Thank you for trying to stop this carnage
Get the US out of the "Sebelius Syndrome" where algorithms just dupe all of you into oblivion https://goo.gl/yXNjtJ 
Get a law passed to index/license all data sellers, we need it-this non partisan request https://goo.gl/PRSVL5 
@buell003 This guy knows all about #voterfraud #Russianchaking coups abroad and home etc. #Constitutionalcrisis
i am hoping for a hail mary in the senate when you vote on Sessions. Plse let there be a magority NO. #nobigotryinjustice
you go !!!!! Xo
, you are my new hero, keep up the good fight!! We desperately need your voice.
@clarencehilljr
Sen Franken, thanks for getting tough on the liar who is destabilizing the US in his first 12 days.
Wouldn't it be best for the AG to investigate and by doing so, put an end to speculation? Afraid it might be true?
then I guess it's a good thing he fired her.
@slater_rose The "massive voter fraud" was Manafort fixing the vote in Wisc., Michigan and Pennsylvania like he did the Ukraine
@clarencehilljr has the investigation been completed or what you basing this on ?
@MishaMishaps   Thank God for you, Senator Franken.
powerful words, Senator
@KristenClarkeJD how can anyone take you seriously! @SNLUpdate
Keep fighting!!!  Thank u thank u thank u
How about when he gets found guilty of stealing $6 million from Americans? This is insane, he's a thief!
thank you!
love the silent chuckle when told to "speed it up".
impersonate someone who doesn't plan to vote or who is dead, and these could be citizens OR illegal aliens. This needs fixing!!!
they are.  PROOF is unfortunately clear that with anyone can vote rules like in California and multiple other states, people can
NO, its YOUR job in Congress to create rules/laws to make all states & DC work together to VERIFY who voted is who they say
I still am in shock that you got elected
It's also the job of this Republican lead Congress to stop this lunatic Trump before he gets us into a really bad war!!!

Good luck with that. These people are all bought and paid for
Well, if anyone knows about winning elections due to fraud it would have to be you.
My God, Senator Franken, if you eliminate lying from the Groper & his cabal, they'd be reduced to being mimes.
lame
go Al!
Well said Senator, but the AG is a Fascist who was put in place by tRump, so will do nothing.
thank you!
@neuronAttX REALLY NOW! What have you been SMOKING.
I know from personal experience that there is widespread election fraud in the US. Only establishment candidates are elected.
How r the riots going for u? Intolerance at Berkeley? Destruction of property is the Democratic way? Committing suicide of Dems
yes! Thank you 
you have a great speaking voice.your speeches r direct to the point and understandable.we share the same views
Thank you for being a voice of reason although it seems there are no reasonable people left in the Republican Party.
remember Robert creamer was fired for admitting bussing around voters to different poll locations?
The only fraud I see is the Russian involvement in our election, and now, Trump admits it. Treasonous.  He must go.
dead do vote. What about Detroit saying they had more votes than registered voters in all blue districts?
remember the dem employee who signed up a dead judge to vote? He only got caught since it was a known person, so it seems the
Sessions believes the lie. No spine will never stand up to president Bannon and his secretary 45.
I say we verify the voter rolls in every state!! If anyone wants popular vote to matter we need ID. Mexico and India have it
@mariced   With all the shit being flung around DJT managed to do what he wanted since election... Payback Putin! Stop Him!!!
thank you senator!  Wish more were like you and Bernie!
Please for the love of God... HELP US!  I'm watching my country implode and praying that you guys DO SOMETHING.
you're my hero since the days I read all your books
Dear Senator Franken please do not address him as President. Reps referred to PBO as Obama. He is just Trump, not President.Tks
He's just "trump" with a little "t" @juneofla @SenFranken I heard someone on @CNN call him "mr. trump" a few days ago.
@ruthe_susan Wow, AJ should have had #Obama in front of her full-time.
Thank you Senator Franken for standing up for us. Your voice makes us stronger.

How do you know he's lying without an investigation?  Know anybody who voted twice?  I do. Now extrapolate.
@ghostofhypotia True. However, we know this AG won't do it. H
Why are you being told to speed it up by a man with a weary tone of voice? Because, you were displaying emotion?
@PurlLeslie 1 problem- racist @SenatorSessions agrees w/lie, prefers shutting down voting for ALL MINORITIES! #WeWontGoBack
@POTUS44  Many of us are looking to our National Leaders to CALL OUT TRUMP, & Rep., ON HIS FRAUDULENT WIN!. RISE UP!
WE THE PEOPLE WANT JUSTICE!
what is with the time thing? Oh please don't waste time with actual questions about facts...
It is your job to impeach this fraud.
@KgKathryn 

And it's your job to execute:

#AmendmentXXV
Dear Senator Franken. I'm Republican, please give every DJT enabling idiot in Congress a beating for me too. They have it coming
God Bless you, Senator Franken. Please keep fighting for sanity.
@RVAwonk Please don't let up, Sen. Franken.
Please work with the @HouseDemocrats & @HouseGOP to begin Impeachment proceedings on Trump.
Well done Sir!!
@kkfunch THANKS! Kick ass Senator! We want our country back!!
