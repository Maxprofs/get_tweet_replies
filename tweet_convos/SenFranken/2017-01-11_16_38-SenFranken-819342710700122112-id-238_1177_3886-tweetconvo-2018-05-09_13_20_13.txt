Good luck!
you don't even know what you're talking about
We in MN are grateful for your service to average citizens who are anxious and deeply disturbed by this downward spiral in D.C.
It's a bill making embezzlement legal via insurance carriers. Paying premiums for literally NOTHING.
@SenSchumer please start using the term TrumpDoesn'tCare when you refer to the Republicans replacement for ObamaCare!!
Thank you! @SenFranken @BlueVotr
Coverage that is becoming more and more unaffordable.  Even our governor admitted this.  #repealobamacare
Ryan and McConnell are going to come aftet Meficare and Social Security.
Thank you.  #SaveACA
.@SenFranken 

With u as a representative I'm thankful I'm not from Minnesota!
@SenSchumer Keep enjoying your $174000+ annual salary & benefits. Ocare exempts lawmakers from using it...why? It's good, right?
@funder 1.Trump colluded with the GOP & Russia during the election to hand Mikhail Fridman of Alpha Bank our Health Care System

@Deemoney521 thank you. Keep up the fight. We are behind you. #theresistence
This list bars ALL coverage.Inpatient/Outpatient services EXCLUDED. Office visits can be considered Outpatient services.
: thank you. We would all be in deep if it weren't for good patriots like you. Please do not stop. Please 
@Skamama01 Thank you Senator Franken. These are dark days. trump dialogue is vacuous. Cannot understand the desire to damage ACA
Thank you Senator Franken. You are a good man and a great Senator.
- Get 'em, sir.
Mr. @SenFranken you are a Clown  Get yours ideas on the state level only....I'm talking about Minnesota, that is the idea #repealobamacare
You... Al Franken.
thanks always been a fan
please fight against the nominees as well. #Resistance #Unpresidented #rejectREX #RejectDeVos #RejectSessions
THANK YOU, Senator Franken! You are AWSOME!
Please, PLEASE help us. We can't go back to being dropped from, or denied #healthcare at a company's whim.
#SaveACA
Thank you for your work to try to save lives and keep healthcare affordable.
@SenSchumer They're not taking coverage. They're trying to correct the issues with Ocare. But you wouldn't understand that.
And, you'll be Voting Against Lower Drug Prices. F' U, Franken; you're just as sleazy as the rest.
Please help protect ethics org.
and Franken continues to lie and be ineffective.
YES!  WE NEED YOU & more of your ilk in DC.
@prezthentonow GOD SPEED and may the FORCE be with YOU!
Good luck Al.
@wtfnewsamerica will yoou know what are in the measures you are trying to keep, or will you wait to find out if they are kept
@riledirish Come on Al! Do something!
@Lindsay05946319 Thank you, thank you and bless you
Thank you, Sir.
THANK YOU senator Franken. Keep eye on my sneaky gov though read #johnsonamendment on video sent to 1000s churches pre-election
gop pleased as punch w/impeachment, because pence is the goal. Trump hearings MUST be preinauguration bc #notrumpmeansnopence
Godspeed!
We need you, @amyklobuchar, and other Dems to fight like the dickens for us. My friends and I are terrified of GOP agenda. Thx.
thank you, from ALL Americans, whether they know it or not.
A valiant effort and thank you.  I wish you had been successful.
Well, I hope you can get other DEMS to support the bill, seems trumps nominees are going to be confirmed. #FDJT #theresistence
let them hang themselves
great! what about Sessions, the other cabinet appointees? how will you vote? Too bad Bernie didnt get nominated eh
strengthen law... u mean make sure ins, companies keep raising costs by 30% or more.
so their lobbyists are giving u money, huh
@SenSchumer defend the ACA! @PattyMurray @amyklobuchar
With @marcorubio as my senator and @FLGovScott In the state house, it might be worth considering a move to Minnesota!
THANK YOU!
Sincerely… thru my tears of terror at losing my healthcare due to pre-existing conditions… I thank you for any/all help
Thank you!!!!!!!
YOU'LL NEVER STOP THE ACA FROM BEING REPEALED, TIME FOR COMMIE FRANKEN-STEIN TO GO HOME....
thank you for your work to protect the ACA.
#Finally Jumping on the bandwagon?
@SenSchumer @dougducey @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @charlesornstein I wish my Republican senators would fight for my ACA coverage.
how can we help?
when r u running for president?
I had to leave my job of 29 years as a direct result of ACA. But I'm sure you don't want to talk to me about that.
You know Minnesotans are seeing HUGE premium increases and STILL you act like nothing is wrong with ACA. Are you incapable of understanding?
thank you for your leadership
@SenSchumer waaahh waaaahh waaaahh
@SenSchumer 
Why haven't Dems& Obama tried to improve ACA?They had to loose election to fix!
You & all the Dems MUST stand up to the Repub bullies. Cannot believe they're gonna strip 30M ppl of their health plans.
@SenSchumer thank you. Hang in there over half the voting population is with you remember you have lots of support.
its a skit from SNL
Thank you for this and also for the fantastic job on the Sessions hearings.
@SenSchumer Won't work Stuart
That didn't end well. Wait until #breastcancer survivors and millions of others w #preexistingconditions wake up tomorrow. #BCSM
Will you also be blocking the Sessions nomination??
keep fighting for us!
@DavidKoechner
@DavidKoechner cool so you'll set us up with your insurance we pay for Al? Cause we can't afford the affordable care act.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @MikePenceVP good words but u don't have votes-time to work w/DJT who shares ur views If u r to win
Thank you. Sincerely, thank you.
Thank you @SenFranken for trying to stand up for regular Americans. @roripierpont1
Somalian Jihadist must love you. Working Tax Payers, not so much.
@SenSchumer why dont u just offer to help redorm the bill ?
Al, am against human cloning but in yr case & select others now, I might make an exception.  We CHERISH YOU.
can you also commit to voting "No" on Sessions and every other Deplorable nominee? #ResistTrump
@PrincessBravato @AwakenOne16 -Keep fighting the good fight!! We must stop these deplorables and uneducated Trumpsters!
Respectfully disagree. The Trumpsters are ignorant and don't want to be enlightened.
@SenSchumer, @SenGillibrand We in NY really hope you guys are fighting as hard as Sen Franken to protect the #ACA.
@SenSchumer I would say you should go back to comedy... but what you do now is quite laughable!
Thank you, Senator. We look to you & other members to protect the people from the GOP power grab, and we won't forget.
Thank you for always looking out for your state.
Keep up the fight @SenFranken! You're not just representing MN, you're representing ALL of us who need the ACA!
# I live in Georgia, could please relocate to Georgia. Thank you.
@SenSchumer Mn called special legislative ses 2 keep ins.2017. Every 1 no's plan dying in MN gone next yr regardless B honest
damn auto correct! I obviously meant Franken.  Now get Apple to fix that bug!
Thank you Senator Frankenstein!
@SenSchumer Please keep up the good work for the people! Thank you!'
@SenSchumer thank you for common sense health care legislation
@SenSchumer So, if congress were to come up with something better, you would make sure that couldn't happen?
@animaeme Please vote against @jeffsessions
Thank you, Al!  I'm a Democrat from OK. I support you and your progressive colleagues.
@SenSchumer God bless you! It's going to be a long 4 years & we are counting on you to keep fighting.
Minnesota gets what they deserve.
don't bother, only an idiot would introduce a bill of this kind, waste of time and money.
you're a real comedian
@joanwalsh Thank you Sen Franken. You keep your cool. We admire that. Unlike Trumplethinskin.
Keep fighting 'em, Al!
@BadASSSery Thank you.
So tell me Al, why did you wait so long to do something about the POS ACA?
you should probably bring it up with gop obstructionist who never showed any willingness to work to fix it
@SenSchumer The ACA is a disaster!
I appreciate the work you're doing to protect health care for us all. Something so reasonable should not be so hard.
@SenSchumer Don't let this become a totalitarian regime. #freedomaintfree
@SenSchumer Repeal the Unaffordable Act.
@SenSchumer LOL  oh so dense - I guess that is what you get when electing somebody that was paid to pretend to be somebody else
@SenSchumer Thank you, keep up the fight!
Thank you, Senator. Those of us in states with Repub Senators appreciate you.
Al - in case you didn't notice the GOP is in control. You don't matter, not that you ever did.
Thank you, Sen. Franken! @Mangoluu
Waste of time.
@SenSchumer senator Al. Quick fix to ACA. Require that congress enroll.
@SenSchumer You two are clueless classless leftist liberal nuts
@SenSchumer Please run for President!
wasting your time. That will all be covered regardless of anything you do. Get to work on something important. Mining leases.
@SenSchumer Repealing the ACA will out rural hospitals out of business. Farmers will be in a world of hurt.
@SenSchumer Please share how with other states governors & senators, as so many desperately rely on ACA. Thanks 4 all u do!
Please help get the word out - Sen. Rubio needs our support in questioning DJT's ridiculous nominee for Sec of State
why didn't you stop it in the first place before it gutted the insurance markets and ripped existing coverage from many?
@SenSchumer Every tech advance has gone down in cost except medical, Only difference is Govt. involvement, nearly 50% in US.
@SenSchumer your both a joke. You had years to fix what was wrong with Obama care and did nothing. Go work for HRC !
@SenSchumer Thank you!
@SenSchumer Both of you plz consider labatomies #HeadInSand
@SenSchumer 
Maybe you should try 'working' with the GOP to that.
@SenSchumer thank you thank thank you! You did a fantastic job questioning Sessions yesterday!
Oh that's ok @SenFranken!! Even that other sleazy democRAT #slickwilly Clinton said Obamacare is a shit law. REPEAL IT NOW @realDonaldTrump
@SenSchumer single mother of two kids I have multiple sclerosis 1 Med $9015.59 A MONTH! U take head of HH, ss MEDICARE away?!?
@SenSchumer can you also stop the inauguration of this compromised despot of a peotus
@SenSchumer if wasting everyone's time with no hope of success is your idea of leadership I feel sorry for you
Glad to hear it. We're counting on you and your colleagues to protect American's best interests.
Got Votes?
@SenSchumer Nice work today. Thanks. Both of you.
and you don't have the majority to get it passed
@SenSchumer thanks BC the NE ones want to leave us high and dry. Might move to MN!
@SenSchumer here's what you do...
- take half US health care $ and fund a plan by GOP and half fund Obamacare. Let people decide
Thank you Senator Franken. Here in the Brainerd Lakes area of Minnesota we are proud to have you as our Senator
@SenSchumer bring it on, Franken!
Thank you! It's a rising tide that lifts all boats. I've a child w/chronic disease who loses "bigly" w/o ACA.
@SenSchumer Either way it is imploding. Talk to Arizonians.
Thank you Senator!
#Franken2020

Al quit being a sock puppet! 
https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/goldRpt/current_report.htm …
Single payer the only way to go
@SenSchumer 
Just rename it Trumpcare and PEOTUS will love it. Then we can work to repeal and replace @realDonaldTrump
@SenSchumer -- miss your radio show Senator Franken -- endlessly grateful for your new job though --
Thank you for taking a hard stand against Jeff Sessions. He is unacceptable as an AG.
thank you! I'm covered via work now it you never know and I can't afford my meds w/o insurance
you're good enough, smart enough and doggoneit I like you.   NYer and Repub, but I hate the current GOP Con and Prez and all of it.
@SenSchumer while you're at it let's do single payer. The majority supports it
@SenSchumer no matter the bill u put forth it has  been denied period.Signed the GOP and also us everyday voters.Stay delusional
Thank you Senator.  I remember before ACA how health insurance companies could just deny insuring you for no reason. @SenFranken
@SenSchumer thank you both!
@SenSchumer THANK YOU!
What about the rest of us? #COVERAGEMATTERS #savehealthcare
@SenSchumer so wrong you are… Not stopping coverage, but getting better coverage
Please stop them

Thank you!
@ja_maloneco Quit fear mongering Senator. Trump will keep pre existing conditions and other key elements. Wait until you see it.
thank you
@tkdmike keep fighting the FAMILY GLITCH LOOPHOLE! It is killing us. We can't get ACA because of.
what is the loophole? Genuinely curious.
@joanwalsh thank you.
Thank you for Referring to the ACA as ACA instead of the overused other name that I refuse to use againThank for having our back
@marvswife Hope it helps.
one can only hope! On the other hand, I seem to have lost all  hope! It keeps getting worse but he'll still be there.
@joanwalsh Thank you, Senator!!
NO REPEAL!  REFINE!
Good luck, Senator.
the GOP can't even vote to keep kids under 26 on their parents health plans.  I doubt anything can be salvaged!   #ACA
Thank you Senator Franken!
@joanwalsh I have a friend, a single mom with 4 kids under 7, struggling to survive, pays $36/ monthly on ACA. Need is great.
Continue being resolute Senator; it's gonna be a long slog.
@joanwalsh Thank You, thank you!!
thank you!!
@joanwalsh r u going to keep it from going thu reconciliation?
