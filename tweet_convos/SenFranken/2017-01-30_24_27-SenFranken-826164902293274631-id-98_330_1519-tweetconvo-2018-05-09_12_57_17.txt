Senate has GOT to require commitment to govt/public ed as secular to uphold 1st amendment
I love you.
Aren't sold on...? How could anyone think this good for public edu.? Zero experience but plenty $.PTP!!
Good to know. Hoping some GOP senators will Also say nay.
can we get any Republicans behind this?  @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC
if she doesn't get confirmed and our rural schools get ravaged by bears that's gonna be on your head Senator.
Thank you for voting NO on DeVos
Thank you but you also need to vote against all the others, they're just as bad & worse than she is!
Thank you @SenFranken. You do a great job for all of us!
and never heard of IDEA!
Trump already has DeVosâ€™s replacement nominee selected -
This public school teacher thanks you! She has zero qualifications. #YesToBears #NotoDeVos
She comes across as cold and frozen. No human touch. Evidently stupid and self serving
She has hired help to wipe her behind, what does she know about struggling folk?
Thank you!
Vote NO on everything. Obstruct everything. Resist everything.
we need Republicans as well to vote NO corporate Democrats like Cory Booker need to be stopped
Set em up and knock em down
