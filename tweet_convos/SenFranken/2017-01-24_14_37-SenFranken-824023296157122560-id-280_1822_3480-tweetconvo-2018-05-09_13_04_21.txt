@margil9000 How about fighting by not voting to confirm any of Trump's cabinet nominees?  This is ridiculous that we have to ask
Why would @POTUS? That was President Obama who sold us out on the internet. @senfranken @annlewischicago
He did? Hmmm. #DementiaIguess
I'll find the article the I get a chance. ;)  @POTUS @SenFranken

How about this total smoke screen. trump wont divest, will you vote to impeach? You know he's coming for net neutrality.
Can't u talk 2 ur republican colleagues & help them 2 see the danger t presents. Or is it that they know & just don't care?
We need more fighters here not capitulators
I wish you had more support from both Dems & Reps but it won't happen. Dem voters leaving your party slowly but surely.

What about the rest of the shit he's common after. So far the perception is that Dems have just rolled over.

Thank you Al!
Thank you. I thought no one noticed his FCC pick.
can you please take Trump to task for gag orders on @natlparkservice @usda and @epa? My America is a free America
Why didn't you fight to delay the inauguration?  Not one senator.
I hope so. I'm seeing all these "yes" voted for unqualified cabinet positions from people who should have our interest in mind
i'm busy preparing to liquidates my assets to leave the US.  The one many army of Franken ain't enough.

@RachelAzzara please fight against price.
@MrJamesonNeat What about all of these EOs???? This is bullshit!  We're living in a nightmare.

Oh, they're coming. No doubt about it. :(  Thank you Senator.

MORE democratic congressional members like you & Maxine MUST speak out STRONGLY everyday.  REPUBLICANS DO!
Good luck with that, Al.  I'm sure that you'll be exactly as effective as them dems have been so far.  Like not at all.  #weak
Run in 2028, and you'll have 3 votes in this house.

Thank you, Senator for fighting for our ability to share and access factual information.
Thank you for your service, Senator. I appreciate your work in Washington.
@macmommamary and people wondered why we are terrified. We are looking at a dictator in action
Thanks Mr. Franken. This is incredibly important not just for media content providers but also information and news providers.
I'm with you Al.
It won't matter because your know-nothing colleagues across the aisle will rubber stamp whatever legislation Comcast provides.
@luvman33wife All you have to do is think as Donald Trump as Big Brother in 1984. We will win
We know you will, Sen. Franken. Thanks and be careful.
