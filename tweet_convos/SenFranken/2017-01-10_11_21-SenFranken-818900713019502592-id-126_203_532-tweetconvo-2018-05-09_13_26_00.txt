Thank you for your informed questioning! Please do everything in your power to stop this man who justifies lies as "my memory at the time"!
Yes.  HRC could not recall hundreds of things in her testimony, but she gets a pass.  Idiot.
Do you have a source for that information?
http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/02/35-times-hillary-clinton-could-not-recall-when-fbi-asked-about-her-emails.html â€¦.  Other time too. Sorry. You lose.
what Sessions did today amounts to lying on your resume and being caught in the job interview
U R making a fool of yourself. Watch Cruz destroy Frankenstein later in the hearing. Wake up
That's not destroying the issue raised by Franken. Why do you support Sessions?
Why don't you support Sessions?  Wants to follow constitution and laws.
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions democrats are traitors to Israel
No we're not. We're just not traitors to Palestine, either.
the corrections
@burroughsben @SenatorSessions Keep up the good work! Never Again Jim Crow!
- Thank you Sen. Franken for posing some of the best questions of the whole hearing!
@frannieOh @SenatorSessions you nailed him, Senator! Good job!
Good job. Well done. #troubling
Thank you Senator Franken. We need your continued  vigilance.
You just got exposed by Sen Cruz. I would hide if I were you.
Yep Franken another out of touch liberal
I just want to hear Trump gets tossed and @HillaryClinton is @POTUS To @BarackObama 
very proud of your questions to Mr. Sessions.
Why didn't you give ALL the info about the guy you quoted saying he LIED? You favored PARTY over America!
thank you for standing up for Americans re: @SenatorSessions. We will not forget. 
Thank you!!!
thank you so much for your service today! Makes me proud to be a new Minnesotan.
Thank You Sen Franken!
Fraudulent votes? Maybe more in the trunk of a car to take you over the limit.  Sad but disgusting
Oh! We just can't wait! Yawn.
Thank You Sen
Thank you, Sen. Franken!!!
Way to go, Sen. Franken!
You got buried by a Cruz missle.  Everything you said was a lie or you're just stupid.  Which is it Stue?
Thank you, sir!
You're an American hero @SenFranken . Thank you for speaking truth to power. @SenatorSessions
Perfection!  Love watching you (as well as Sanders, Warren, & Sherrod Brown) on these hearings & the Senate floor! Keep it up!
Thank you Mr. Franken, you made America proud today. You are a true patriot, and this country thanks you.
made a fool out of yourself
Oh la la!!  Super hero!  Get real.
This is interesting @SenFranken questioning @SenatorSessions this is better than an SNL skit it is reality.
100% Voting ID should b applied  just as Democrat run Hawaii where voter ID a must We have no problem
https://youtu.be/0p-8MLGHh7g 
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions Show AMERICANS you are moving forward not backwards by accepting him. It will boost your party Up.
Everyone should vote NO on #Sessions
it's obvious you're not a lawyer! I've listened to the confirmation hearing from the beginning.I don't think you'll be reelected
Git, 'im, Al!!
great lawyering today!! Whoo Hoo!  You were awesome!
I'm not a lawyer, either, but am often mistaken for one. And those other attys tell me words mean same to all~ @senatorsessions
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions well done Senator Frankenstein!
Thank you! Excellent!
Just watched the video Al.(Can I call u Al) Thank you for the bals to go after this man who can't remember shit
@SenateDems grill these fools!!!!!! Dig deep! Don't make it easy the right doesn't fight with fairness or reason
.@SenFranken You were amazing! Thank you!!
Thank you for raising serious questions about @SenatorSessions in his confirmation hearing! #LoyalOpposition
You are a perfect example of the liberal turd face
Orrin Hatch regurgitates Session's fine acts. Is that a hearing? Get a Room
Good thing you're a comic. I laughed at your asinine, insulting line of questioning from start to finish.
Doggone it Senator - We Like You!
You were better as an actor and comic.
If there had been an honest AG in office when you were first elected, you would have LOST. #corrupt
I strongly oppose him as AG. His history of fabrication is evident to the American people!
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions the point of this is...?Virtue signaling thru bureaucratic masturbation.Dems r powerless,thx Harry

sen franken kicks butt!! Good going showing what a liar Sessions is
Did you even watch? Cruz pointed out what an idiot Franken is with facts.  Get your head out. STFU
Yes I watched. You obviously didn't. Cursing does not make it true.
I guess those under oath testimonies put quite a hole in your lame attempt to make a liar out of Jeff Sessions.  Failure!
thank you for your vigorous questioning. #Noethicsnovote
guess which version of al Franken showed up at the Senator Sessions confirmation hearing and got his ass kicked. This one 
do we have to remind you the Dems are the party of KKK? Sen Robert Byrd(D) was active member & leader of KKK
You rocked  @SenFranken @SenateDems @SenatorSessions #sessions
ccYou obviously do not understand Law in this country. Jeff Sessions does! Your questions were redundant.
I would stammer too if several loud mouths interrupted me and lied about cases I counseled on.
Thank you Senator Franken for your strong resolve and unrelenting questioning. Please vote NO on Senator Sessions.
Good job.
Thank you for your questions & efforts to protect the process, the position, & the American people
Ask Sessions relationship to FAIR, CIS, and CSP pls
Bravo @SenFranken way to not back down and speak the truth on the floor.
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions Hey Al why don't U call for investigating how Iran gets cash, uranium & is emboldened to nuke Jews?
Did you hide under your desk when Ted @tedcruz shut you down? Give it up, Franken. Shoulda stayed with SNL.
...@tedcruz didn't expose shit. Let off the gas.
the questioning was spot on-Go Al Franken!
Tell @tedcruz to fry up some green eggs & ham for us.  @SenateDems @SenatorSessions
"Portrayal" is the correct wrd. Thanks 4 exposing his lies. His gentlemanly manner fools no one but the foolish
as a constituent I appreciated your questions & continuing to push the issue. #stopsessions
congratulations! (on not being a lawyer;) 
Thank you!
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions you were just criticized for your questions. Must stay tough! Forget being polite.
Truth BOMB!
Well done, sir. A thorough and specific line of questioning on a topic of great importance. Thank you! #cabinethearings
Thank you, Sen. Franken!
We appreciate you questioning and standing up to Sessions. We do NOT want him confirmed for AG! #TheResistance
.@SenFranken @SenatorSessions Well done, Senator Franken.
Thank You!
Give all you got Mr Franken.  I support you. No on Sessions.
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions you did an awesome job. Call a spade a spade.
**snatch that hood off
cruz's only motive is to look good for SCOTUS nomination. Franken's points still hold: jeff put his name on docs to look good
Oh yes. Cruz tried to throw you under the bus.
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions SO PROUD YOU ARE MY SENATOR!!
You were brilliant today!! Thanks Al!
cannot rewrite history no matter how hard #Trump & "team" promote revisionism. Thank you Sen Franken!
@SenateDems @SenatorSessions Are you just putting on a show for us, or are you actually working to stop his confirmation?
Well done!!
great job!!  You had him sweating.
You certainly had the best time so far.
You left him in the dust Sir.
LMFAO! Ted delivered!
Al is better than the average from the right. They're more like the schoolyard punks.
great job. It was the highlight of my day.
Legal Marijuana questions need to be explored
Thank you.

.@SenTedCruz points out that @SenFranken's attack was based on false testimony that was later recanted. http://bit.ly/2jyWK0G 
@DailySignal @SenTedCruz That's a right wing political spinner, far from center for truth.
What ever makes you feel better
Truth always.
Sure
Thank you Senator Franken, you're doing an impressive job with your questioning. I appreciate your integrity!
Thank you very much Senator Franken for representing my interests and concerns in the Senate.
Please ask him about his record on disability rights.
Thank you! Keep pushing. @tedcruz is trying to question the legitimacy of your line of questioning.
You were great! These are the questions all should be asking, not just you!  Thanks for being a voice!
thank you Al for your work today!
Thanks Al!
You were simply amazing. Bravo.
