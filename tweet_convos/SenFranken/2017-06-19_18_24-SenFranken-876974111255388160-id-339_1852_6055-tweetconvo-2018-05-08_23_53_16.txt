Thank you,  Senator Franken!
Serious question, How is this different from when Obama care was passed?
NPR just reported there were 8 months of hearings,testimony, debate. Wasn't secret. In terms of rules to pass w/fewer votes, the same.
Can you link please?
It was on The Take Away with John Hockenberry- just checked, today's show not posted yet.
Thank you Senator Franken
THANK YOU!  FILIBUSTER BY AMMENDMENTS!
PUNCH THE GOPs IN THE GUT FOR US!!
Thank you @SenFranken
Go get em tiger!
Thank you so much!  @SenFranken
Where were you when the Dems did it? "You'll have to pass it in order to see what's in it".
Go Al.
Be serious but throw in some shtick for good measure!!
@donale1 @SenateGOP is ashamed of the  bill....YET they press  on
Yes! Debate and disclosures about #GOP #DeathCare plan!
Thank you for working to protect the Affordable Care Act. You have my support.

YES!! Thank you, Senator Al Frankenstein! Kick some ass for us!! 
Thanks for looking out for us man!
When you first ran for Senate, my daughter sent you $1 from Ohio. All her $$. She was 6. Glad she did. Thanks for all you do.
Have you WATCHED Philando Castille dash cam video to see ur fellow MN gunned down in cold blood in front of a baby?
WARREN / FRANKEN 2020!
Go gettem'!
Hell yeah! Go get 'em!
Hold the Floor! Please call out the worst senator in American HISTORY @SenToomey who actively hdies from his constituants. #ToomeyIsaCoward
Seems like a familiar situation with reversed roles #Obamacare
Thank you. Secrecy isn't how our country should be governed.
Do any of the folks playing government have any idea how tired we folks out here are of all of the nonsense going on in WH?
Awesome Sen. Franken! Thank you
I wish u "much luck" with this #AltrntvAdmin . #shameful ! #USA citizens deserve transparency & cooperative communication frm #POTUS #YES !!
Thank you!!
Carry a big stick!
I hope you're a fast reader Al @SenFranken !
Good luck, keep fighting the good fight..
Remember this is a type of genocide that gop wants...no healthcare, then it's death, then "YOU" start loseing votes b/c there dead already.
Thank you Sen. Franken for being a smart and appealing alternative for 2020.
@soccermom1517 @SenateGOP hopefully their plan will get lost and never be found.
Good Luck
You wouldn't consider moving to Wisconsin, would you?
#HoldTheFloor #resist #insist #persist
Good luck, Senator. Here's hoping two or three of your colleagues in the @SenateGOP still have a working conscience.
THANK YOU, SENATOR!
Thank you, Senator!  I appreciate what you and Senator Klobuchar are doing!
Thank you for standing up for our rights, @SenFranken !!!

You'd be a "treat" as President Al!
I love you Al Franken! 
So proud of you Senator Franken!!!
Thank you for fighting for the health care of Minnesotans.
We're fighting 4 the wrong things.Dems & Republicans want us to rely on insurance companies & CEO's who constantly fuck us in the ass. Help
The insurance companies already reneged on the ACA act by doubling our rates just before the election causing this enormous anger still here
Democrats have to pretend the ACA is a great healthcare bill when it's a piece of shit.Our rates, already high doubled.Who can absorb that?
Are you here to fight for the people or the insurance companies who are raping the people while paying you guys to look the other way.
Thanks for doing this! BTW, Can y'all call for peeps to get out in the streets like South Koreans did?  That's what's needed.
Get 'em Al!!
Another loon dem shows America just how much he hates us! Loved black whimp community disorganizer, hates a mam in WH
GET'M Sen Franklin!!! O'Connell is a total ass 4 pushing this bill!! What d hell is wrong w/d Gop. #OConnellhastogo #impeachthemall #0heart
Thank you!
Go get 'em Al!
Thank you for standing up for all of us, Senator.
I think if you have to shut the government down you should
Thank you.
Thank you for working to #HoldTheFloor
Thank you.
I was diagnosed w/Arthritis @ 15 so I've spent my life w/a preexisting condition. Wot would my divorced mother have done w/o ins coverage?
But Al, that's exactly what the Democrats did with Obamacare.  How is this any different?
These are the times when a senator speaks for more than just his own constituents. #MrFrankenGoesToWashington
U are dangerous u are the enemy of America and ur a danger to any American who puts God and country first ur enemy to 63 million Americans
If this is a filibuster you could take up hours by reading peoples tweets about Trumpcare.
Good luck Senator.  You could not use a sharp 63 yr old woman who was Legal Coord for BC/BS in DC?
5 LIES------that the Democrats told about the new health care law

Frankin panders to you all and you all just suck it up.
You dims hid it, passed  it, lied about it over and over and now want us to be mad at Republicans. You are a joke and a bad one at that.
Thank you!  Don't stop!  I have stage4 BC. This matters. #ShowUsTheBill #preexistingconditions #nolifetimecaps
How can I help you, Al Franken??? You are the best!!!
Thx Senator
And it will do nothing. Do something useful like shut them down-they r violating OUT right to representation
DON'T LET THEM DO THIS. WHY DO THEY HAVE ALL THE CONTROL?
Thank you, Al!
Thank you for standing up for our rights! Please continue to #HoldTheFloor don't let this be pointless.
Thank you Al Franken. The end of press conferences & attempts to pass AHCA behing close doors is the end of our democracy & public education
Senator...you guys need to use hot button words like...death panels...unpatriotic...killing people....this IS a fight..and it's dirty!!
Throwing 23 million off Health Care is political TERRORISM....This is what GOP have become!!
Thank you, Sen. Franken
Good luck, Senator! Thank you for all your hard work, I believe you will fight til the end with us! ♡
Resist!
give them hell Sen. Franken! You are a breath of fresh air for the dems!!
Good luck!  McConnell is on "I object" autoplay.
GO BOYYY. Sir.
@SenFranken Start calling it what it is "Trump tax break bill". There is no consideration for health.
#Trump and #Republicans aregoing to destroy #health of #Americans with their #bad plan . #Senate needs to hear from #publics #voice on HPlan
Go get em Al! Bust out some Stuart Smalley and make them look into the mirror.
We're all really scared and besides calling we're helpless out here we know it's bad, it must be really awful for them to hide it like this
Thanks, Senator Franken!  We're all behind you. Let them know their plan is horrible and their process, dispicable.
Remember you need to sign the bill before you know whats in it!!! Good ole Pelosi
Thank you! Hope the GO listens. So tired of the gun to my head.  At least I'll know soon if GOP is pulling the trigger...on me & millions.
How effective do you think you will be?
Been watching
#SaveTheACA
You're the best Senator!  Everyone's behind you!  Rock on!
I felt the irony and yes it is palpable. Keep up the good work!
Go get 'em!!! You rock!!!
This is not a healthcare plan, it's a tax cut.
Like the saying goes : "Secrets keep you sick"... DON'T ALLOW THIS BILL TO PASS!
Like when your ACA was going lower my premiums by $2500? Or Polisi said we'd have to pass it to see what's in it? 100% Dem only!
Thank you, Senator, for fighting for the people. #HoldTheFloor #Resist
THANK U AND OTHERS!!!!!!!!!
Shut them down senator
I can't believe they are getting away with this..isn't this illegal?
Go get em Al!!!
Go get em Al.
We need health care. We need pre-existing conditions covered & treatments for them. I pay $1800 a month for coverage now. More than house.
Duh u think
They need to be forced to show what they are trying to do. We also need time to read and study it carefully.
Great job!
Yay! Go Al! I'll tell you what I think about your book later,cause your obviously busy at the moment.
Kick McConnell in his little girly balls!

The GOP is corupt & evil.It shows they know what they doing is wrong , why else hide it. Vote all republicans out
Not from the public, from you. Because you'll bog down the process & accomplish nothing as usual! But you'll appear to care about the ppl
Yes. Thank you.
Let's please stop calling it a health care plan.  It's clearly a Wealthcare Plan.  Plan for the wealthiest...nothing 'healthcare' about it.
Thank you---you have to wonder if all these Republican's think they will hold on to their jobs? Amazing that they don't care about us.
#repealdontreplace You have to vote on it to see whats in it. But, if you like your Dr you can keep your Dr.
Tell it like it he it is senator
Thank you
Go Get 'Em Senator Franken!
Go get it!
Proud to call you my Senator!
Bless you Al!
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Franken!!
Thank you, Senator! I appreciate it!
Give'em hell, Senator!
Thank you for having the American people's back.
Give em hell, Al.
The #GOP is doing the Dictator's bidding.  This isn't the American democracy any longer. Citizens need to stand up.  @maddow #DEM #P2
We are counting on you.  #HoldTheFloor
