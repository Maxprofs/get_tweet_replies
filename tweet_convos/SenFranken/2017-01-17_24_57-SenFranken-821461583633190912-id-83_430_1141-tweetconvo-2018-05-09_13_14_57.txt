because he should be in jail for insider trading
Broker controlled blind account. Try again.

The fake news story has been debunked already.
ur "proof" is amateur site quoting...a random person on twitter #seemsLegit
no his words at his hearing actually.He didn't use broker didn't use trust - got special price
I was trader for 20 yrs. that is insider trading plain-simple. And special price is free option
because UR Wikipedia bio lists comedian 1st &U need material 4new stand up act? Those w/brains view U as a joke
I guess you view the reality star Donald Trump as a joke too

There needs to be more info on the ethics of this nominee, to fully vett him.
Delay, at the very least. Investigation into insider trading allegations needed @SenSchumer
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov because you just want to make me mad so I'll tweet badly about you.

@neeratanden @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Thank you!
@neeratanden @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Because he may have broken law.  Is that good enough?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov He is being investigated for insider trading.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov a serious look into his finances is in order.
cause some boss said so. u cannot think 4 yourself that is sure. big arc!
I bet Martha Stewart knows why 
Thanks for getting all up in DeVos's grill tonight. She is absolutely worthless.

INVESTIGATE NOW! READ #DworkinReport AND HERE @Khanoisseur! SMOKING GUN FOUND. #TREASON #TRUMPLEAKS #mobmoney
@SenSchumer Al I vote you as Chuckies number 1 clown. That the role your most suited for!
You ask why Mr Franken....is because you are a mindless Democrat instead if a proud American
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Why do Marxists Celebrate when Democrats win and March in Protest when Democrats LOSE?
@RepTomPrice @realDonaldTrump His nomination should be denied. he and @BetsyDeVos are just bad 4 r country. Trumps nominees r all criminals
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov please stand for transparency of all personal and business dealings of those who act for us
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov You were a lousy comedian Fraken but sonehow managed to become a worse Senator.
Delayed? That should be the least thing that happens to this crook. Us nobodies would be in jail by now
You need to look into that a little more closely. You may have fallen for fake news!
or maybe Price is a crook.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov well I might ask him why it is ok to commit stock fraud but another to
deny poor people bury control; graft is ok but sex isn't?
funny how high flying right wing moralists are always hiding closet full of skeletons
every time one opens their mouth, a bone flies out?
anything you want, I'm against
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Take your time
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov   When are these people going to finalize their ethics and tax information
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov 'cause he's a crook?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov 
Thank you.  People do care.  M. Stewart went to prison for something similar to this.
Stand your ground Al!!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Ethics issues wrt his stock purchases a week prior to pushing a pharma bill?
B/C you are "Al Franken & Chuck Schumer" obstructionists.  Think about being Statesman!
Coming in 8 yrs ago and blocking other party from bringing their ideas to table for mst hist legisl didn't incite sedition?
- Most Americans know why! Thanks All 
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No one cares why u want it delayed. Maybe chuck. But literally no one else.
Sen. Franken, just out of curiosity, since all is being laid out: What stocks do you have again?
Thank you Sen. Franken. Put his feet to the fire.
Thanks Senator from me. Do a THOROUGH investigation/questioning on him. He's wrong for job. SO wrong.
