That was always ludicrous.     
He's in hock up to his ass,and trying to get out of it !!
Yes, but we know he has mental illness & lives in his own reality. He is actually for sale.
No one who bothered to look past the image ever thought otherwise.
I watched in "awe" watching you SCHOOL 45s appointees! Keep em in √ cuz they r  BAD NEWS w self serving agendas
do you know what caused the financial collapse in 2008??? So making it easier for sm bus to borrow money is a bad thing???
@hmbryan @realDonaldTrump He's paying down his debt indirectly & leave the White House in the black at the country's expense.
@GOP @TheDemocrats has anyone one noticed #MAGA  actually means making trump and his buddies richer
#ResistLiberalBullShit
HIs GOD is MONEY. He is doing everything to make himself & his family / friends rich.
don the con sells out to wall street
He does have a problem knowing where his loyalties belong, the citizens or his cronies.
U are a citizen. U don't support him. Why would he support you. It's no longer about helping satan
@N2glass @realDonaldTrump lollll he drops to his knees for peanuts so broke so desperate a thief robbing charities & campaign$
Al, maybe this answer is Here: #TrumpsChumpsDumpTrump is the soon to be true story of a rich lad whose mind was in the gutter.
you don't get it. He's doing the buying. It's a down payment for post presidency.
@eprophotog @realDonaldTrump So true.
's rich friends can't make a buck with all these regulations saying who can't cheat who out of their retirement
But but but Hillary Clinton gave a speech to Wall St that one time!  **facepalm**
He owes Putin and Comey an election.
@TheClaudiaBlack @realDonaldTrump that's because Bannon is the real president.
he has been bought by Betsy DeVos , putin, Bannon, mnuchin, Tillerson, kushner, ailes, and many many more
Saunders is a true coward
Here's #AlFranken at his very best!
Why isn't somebody recommending impeachment? What does trump have to do that he hasn't yet? 60% of Americans want to know.
@bonniehorgos what about the 19% of Rosneft he just acquired Al?
not bigger than a country,
trump is making the swamp extra swampy...No draining here.  Calling him out publicly will get under his skin
he's draining the swamp and filling it with alligators
he is pumping toxic waste into the swamp while insisting he is draining it.  #swampmonster
Still the Clown!
@RodMyers22  Yeah, wonder how much Wall Street will "gift" tRump
to big to be bought. So he will settle for being used by Putin, Pence & Ryan. #notmypresident
What happened to the little guy the forgotten man -LOL
I'll add short the housing market to  my plans for 2019
he was never for the people Senator.  Steve Bannon and him are trying to destroy whAt America is about
you mean President Bannon, right?
@melodychi @realDonaldTrump
oh. He has definitely been bought!
Like Besty DeVos didn't buy her nomination. Please!!
doesn't sound so bad when you call it a "donation"

con man
better Wall Street to incentivize business than the Chinese, Russians or any other enemy we want to appease.
no one ever has enough money, especially self proclaimed millionaires who won't release their taxes!
Tell that to Putin and his 19%of Rosneft that is now in trumps hands..
He's helping his "friends"... http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2016/10/20/trumps-business-credit-score-is-19-out-possible-100.html …
He is also ending fiduciary response of brokers especially could impact retirees
We need to take one hour airtime and gi over each thing they just took away and what it means- then repost distribute everywhere
Trump has been bought, but by whom? WHERE ARE HIS TAXES AND DIVESTMENT FACTS?
#Donald?  Not to big at all.  I'm pretty sure he'd sell his soul to the devil if the price were right.  Sad.
can't sell what you don't have!
It's okay to use the word "corruption."
Think of what it takes for the GOP to be waiting and ready to destroy all these regs. But yet, no healthcare
he actually bought his own election bc he couldn't get donors at first.
how close are the impeachment proceedings? Can't take too much more #TheResistance
It has been 13 days or so and the American people cannot take much more of this let alone 4 years.  We must look into 25th Amend
no new amendments needed, he will be impeached quickly- just gotta figure out what to do with Pence 1st
gifting the greediest douch bags on the planet instead of creating jobs, probably will cause a loss in jobs
C'mon, man
will repeal Dodd-Frank so his rich pals can borrow money more  easily. THIS DESTROYED THE MIDDLE CLASS yrs ago!
Let's have an update.
Trump said "friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can’t borrow money," Aww how sad, no conflicts here
Gee, and its so easy for middle class folks to get low interest loans 
, if only there were signs @realDonaldTrump was dishonest before last Nov. Sad. #signseverywhere #NoBanNoWall
Trumpers believe everything they hear (on Fox News) not capable of independent thought or judgement.
so far trump has done nothing to help the US middle class and has actually hurt Americans and our environment
With all due respect Sen Franken, #Trump is owned lock, stock and barrel by Putin. One day we'll find out why.
always about Trump and his billionaire cronies wallet, but guess what orange one the money u spend is not yours
THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING TRUTH! #RESIST #SHOWYOURTAXRETURNS #LOCKHIMUP #IMPEACHTRUMP #PUTINGATE
true- but Pence is just as bad... maybe worse. Gotta have a plan for both.
We've agreed on what he is, now we are just haggling on price.
But her speeches and emails...
oh my! The emails! Horrors! I know I prefer nuclear war to a president who had a private email server 
don't forget the speeches too. Sorry, can't keep it up, the sarcasm and eye rolling.  But we are I think in agreement.
Still haven't seen those dang taxes either.
- Lola's Kelly Ann said we never will. He doesn't want to confirm what we already know.
yet his supporters think he's looking out for them when he is helping steal their money
Please share what the Republicans are muttering under their breath!

tell me more about those speeches Hillary gave-you gave those assholes cabinet jobs and eased their laws!
.@realDonaldTrump is a liar and a fraud and it's best y'all start treating him as such.
any Trump follower who is not outraged by this is nothing more than an immoral hack.
.@senfranken They didn’t necessarily need to buy @realdonaldtrump. Businessmen just like to give one another gifts, right?
