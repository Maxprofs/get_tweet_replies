Drain the Swamp for all Americans is coming.  Incumbents will leave
Your wasting your breath
can you please Please please get them to get out of their pocketbook voting, and back to We The People? #noDeVos
@puppymnkey @BetsyDeVos most private schools created in Ga in 1970 2keep white kids from black kids.They will steal public funds
senators, please vote NO! An experienced, dedicated, TRAINED educator should be in this important position
keep up the great work - your constituents appreciate it tremendously
@VatiaSpider @BetsyDeVos Hey Al, NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR VOTING RECORD ON TRUMP NOMINEES.
@puppymnkey then why is @BetsyDeVos being forced down our throats?!
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos Translation: She's the perfect choice. @POTUS @RealBenCarson @realDonaldTrump @VP #MACA #educate 
Al, if you could visit our class in Ottawa it would be the event of the century!
let's work together as congress has in the last 8 years.
Thank you Senator for your fierce advocacy for children, families, teachers, and public schools. #NotoDeVos
Respectfully disagree It appears youve fallen for negative propaganda and manipulative fear mongering of a lying tyrant
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos she can't even tie her shoe...the kids dont want her that says a lot.
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos so Tillerson was? Sessions? Are you kidding me! So does the GOP have guns to the Dems head?
And Al Franken pocketing $150,000 from teachers unions didn't hurt either.  Same old pay to play right al?
@Eemunchagote I love you guys so much
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos This is funnier than his SNL skits!
haaaaaaaaaaa.
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos thank you!
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos I'm in NC and repeatedly sent requests for my Senators to vote NO.
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos Whatever, Frankenstein. If Pawlenty runs against you next time around, you're toast.
if Sessions is confirmed before the DeVos vote, does he still get to vote? Wouldn't that reduce the # of votes needed to defeat?
, we need more senators that stand up and fight for what's right...Good jobs...in Trumps words"SHES A NO BIG TIME"
@Lido21201Lido .Continue to hit Pres Cheetos HARD. We stand w you!
COMMUNISTS....ERRRR I Mean PROGRESSIVES STICK TOGETHER. YOU KNOW THIS AL!
HELP!!!   HE REMOVED RUSSIAN SANCTIONS AND WILL REMOVE THE REST!  GOP IS ENABLING THIS.  WHERE IS CIA?!?
You heard it here first: #AlFranken2020
franken, a comic, a senator, neither. and empty suit!
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos the only reason you are still in senate is due to a trunk load of votes appearing from nowhere
C'mon, Senator Al, she can get us all cheap Amway Soap-On-A-Rope!
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos ..the confirmation vote for this unqualified nominee will demonstrate the integrity of the Senate Repubs
doing a great job in cabinet hearings, proud of you.
Senator Headcase..When are you challenging Ted Cruz to the debate? Could you please do it soon..I can use the money!
you don't have to convince US you have to convince your peers in congress
Love you guys you have my back. WE SHALL OVERCOME..
IT IS TRUM/PREPUBLICANS PLAN TO PRODUCE MORE DUMB SHITS (AKA DEPLORABLES) BY GUTTING THE PUBLIC ED SYSTEM!  RESIST!!
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos Al Poster Child 4 Dems you specialize in lying, cheating & name calling. You stole election from Coleman
It's clear that Democrats will find every excuse to obstruct Trump's administration.
Thank you Sen. Franken. May clear heads prevail.
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos Franken, your a perfect example of how unions failed our education system!

I bet Ms. Smith understands "Proficiency v. Progress" much better than the current nominee.
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos well senate keeps putting people in anyhow.  How do we stop them?
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos well of course!  She is for the parents and child!  So I say vote for DEVO
Thank you!! #resist
.@SenFranken @BetsyDeVos Al Franken is not up to the task of being a US Senator representing #Minnesota
.  Franken is a joke & a disease. Minnesota = Jesse Ventura, Keith Ellison, & Franken. 2nd coming of Ca.?
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos Thank you. #OurChildrenAreWatching #SayNotoDevos @SenateGOP
I am a Texas liberal and have a great spokesman in @JoaquinCastrotx . My senators are a lost cause. Help us, please!
@txmetroasdfw WOW WHO LET THIS CLOWN BECOME A SENATOR? HE CANT EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH CORRECTLY. SCRIPT KIDDY!
he needs to go back to SNL...hes useless now.
LOL HE IS A CLOWN
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVos Go Katy! You're the best!
@SenateDems Not sure @BetsyDeVos could organize, manage, monitor an intramural flag football game!
PLEASE get one more vote! She is HORRIBLE for education,. Do you need 2 more if they us Sessions votes?
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING, SENATOR FRANKEN!!! 
Senator - remember when Kissinger called SNL for show tickets & you answered the phone?  His underling is going for SCOTUS.....
what's the latest on GOP Sens that may be on fence re: DeVos?  Anyone other than SenDebFischer, NE ?
@KatyMN12 Two of my favorite people! Thank you both for your fierce advocacy for kids!
Right back atcha, friend.
As a public school teacher, I agree. No to @BetsyDeVos
Betsy, I want you to look in that mirror, and I want you to repeat after me: "I am a worthy human being." #Resist
.....2011? A lot has happened since then, is this your idea of a counter argument?.....nothing to see here.
how can we help other senators realize how unqualified @BetsyDeVos is as well?
Heavens to Betsy: NO to DeVos!!!! Keep up the pressure, Senator Franken!
- Fortunately I do not value your opinions.
I can't believe all that was standing between us and all this madness was @BarackObama!?
is unqualified and a crony. Nobody should buy themselves a cabinet position regardless of who is in power!
