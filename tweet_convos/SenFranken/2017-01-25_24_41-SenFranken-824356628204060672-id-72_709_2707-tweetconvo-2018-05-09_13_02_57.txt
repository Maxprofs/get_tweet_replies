@dixie70056 @realDonaldTrump wasn't it more than that?
I thought it was 3.6 million, but I could be wrong.
agree, can't only quote the HRC numbers. We need the whole picture including 3rd party.
But he did win the unpopular vote, so ... HE WON! There. Now he's all remoralized again!
.@SenFranken @MoniqueMellon Cabinet votes should stop until he explains lies, exec orders, the country is in crisis Senator #theresistence
I saw my dad get like this as he descended into dementia, irrational, paranoid, stubborn to extreme, grandiose at times
He has major probs for sure DEMS must not act/cont to do biz as normal,have spines,this may be only chance we get
Here is a fact your person who ran 4 President is now lost  2 times U make excuses for her lost That is a FACT
Important to remember a Minority of people voted for him

He does not represent the values of Majority of USA
Who cares. You don't win a football game by accumulating the most yards. You need to score points. POTUS scored the points. Win!
Yet his PR stunt landed him in the highest office in the land! Surrounded himself with uber NeoCons. Help!
Al why did you vote to approve Nikki Haley?
Haley was Bush/Rubio b4  45*. (No Putin fan) & gov. Better than others. Pick ur battles
Trump isnt holdin himself acctable w/ self-regulating integrity to American democratic process so...
These are not normal times. These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. https://www.facebook.com/theDanRather/posts/10158087282405716 …
and another 7 million voted 3d party. Lost pop voice by near 10 mil
Please Help Us. It is getting Uber insane
and seems to be the driving point of his voter fraud claims. No facts, just punish people who don't support 
sounds like FAKE NEWS to me!
Crybaby, Butthurt, Snowflake, Get over it! Trump won...this is what they say to liberals, but...
and there were another what 5,6,7 Million who voted 3rd party?
if #DJT still thinks there was voter fraud - let's call for a do-over!
@HillaryClinkon @realDonaldTrump 
Illegal Immigrants Are Voting in American Elections
http://ln.is/com/LL4c2m3 
@HillaryClinkon @realDonaldTrump Allowing illegals to vote in California, invalidates all of California's votes for President.
can't we the people fire him? The majority of tax payers don't like how he's spending $. How do we do this?
And, boy does he HATE that!
Afraid we'll be seeing some #alternativefacts on this soon, and more #votersuppression @SenFranken @SilverAdie @realDonaldTrump
@Boynton117 @realDonaldTrump Burnnnn..."words matter"
Not really; there is no actual "popular vote" for anybody to win or lose. But this mistake is understandable.
An actual fact is that DJT won 30 of the 50 States. As it turns out, that impacts the Electoral College.
you not getting that delusional obsession is the real issue?
There are too many issues tangled together, and it's fouling normal analysis...
There is the obsession, which is partly real, but also seems largely being read into it...
Then there's the endless dueling "bogus analyses" (pop vote, removing CA, blah blah blah)...
Then there's what may be a continual trolling of the left, which enervates as it distracts...
Then there's the boundless (partisan) ill-will from cultural gatekeepers.
Rumor has it he will find 2.9 million fraudulent voters. #TrumpWeakNeedy
its a tactic called divert attention from PT
Al, keep going on these people.#freakshow
@alexespind where is your legislation to end electoral college..:. Please be a leader...we are counting on you.
We truly need our Dem leaders to get to work
didn't you take an oath to something... you know we live in a #Republic
2.8 mil is nothing
Were not the US of @LosAngeles
damn straight!
and that includes both of Brannon's votes.
What are Democrats going to do about CrossCheck?  Any lawsuits in progress?  #VerifiableElections
I know-U know-We all Know this is a ploy to enable Governors to suppress voting by minorities-You work (1)
- YOU are a Sen., how about doing something about this voter suppression Misdirection? #TheQuietCoup (2)
#AlternateFacts  #AlternateReality #0Credibility #WeGotWork2Do #Accountability #Credibility #Truth #Integrity #Hope
also known as fiction.
@mrapier @realDonaldTrump 
Does it make you feel more like a man to make fun of someone your not in grade school any more Sen.
and he is still the president
and your point is.... he won the Electoral College ...is that not how the US determines presidency?
He is not saying that Trump didn't win, just that his claims of winning the popular vote are false.
@DavidADemarest @realDonaldTrump Hey! Trump President Naaaoow!!!
Senator please include the 7million + votes for the other candidates not named @realDonaldTrump or Clinton in these posts about pop. vote
Its an Alternative fact, There is no such thing as a National Popular Vote
For god's sake, DO something about this ignorant madman. GEEZUS.
alternatively, he won by -2.86 million votes.
.@SenFranken, He's trying to get us to "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain." Focus on harm done, don't get distracted by B/S
Republican gaslighting is sickening. It insults voters' intelligence & you should be offended too
If the popular vote were the determining method, we would not be in this mess. Abolish the Electoral College!
And, 74,000,000 mil voted against him!
And he's President. Good talk!
Not so fast slick.
Donald Trump knowingly broke the law and assumed a position he is not legally allowed to- arrest him https://twitter.com/foxoriondesign/status/823995277803560960 …
Even his own lawyers say that there was no voter fraud.
then an investigation will determine that and that will be case closed
will you vote no on DeVos?
So if investigation finds there was voter fraud in HIS favor,do we get to dump his ass and have a new election?
Why should this man be able to spend taxpayer money on this and his wall? 25 billion could help a lot of people
HRC got more votes & nothing will EVER change that.  Trump has lowest approval of any new Prez - another fact.
This is why Trump wants to "investigate". He wants to get that number down so he wins popular vote. #propaganda
It's definitely an inconvenient fact.
please stop Trump, his lies and dangerous agenda.  Enemy of the state!
And now we have to pay for his pride with yet another nonsensical investigation.
