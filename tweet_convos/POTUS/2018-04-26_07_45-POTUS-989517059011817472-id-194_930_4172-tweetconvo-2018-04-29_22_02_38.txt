Did he talk about his bone spurs? #FakePresident #FakeHero #CadetBoneSpurs
Looks like u r planning a military  coup Duck.

Remarks is about all you can call his rambling self-aggrandizing rants.

Wrong video.
Here's the correct one
Consider Giuliani for VA head..  Ex-mayor of NYC would be great for vets

‘The search of Michael Cohen’s office in New York was an ACT OF TERROR! MUELLER knew it was going to happen. ROSENSTEIN authorized it!…

I think it's remarkable they don't dare to call it "giving a speech" anymore when he talks. In fact, it's remarkably honest.

You mean @DonnieBoneSpurs? Sorry, we're all too busy laughing at him becoming unhinged on FAUX news this morning. Our Wounded Warriors deserve a hell of a lot better then a draft dodger speaking since he's cut their medical care and was nominating a drunk to oversee the V.A.
Rob, there's such a thing called a First Amendment in our Constitution. Anyone, myself included, is allowed to have free speech. I suggest you get your head out of your a** and stop telling people what to do. Especially when you don't know history.
No.

This is a man who thinks so little of their needs that he nominated an inexperienced, under qualified personal physician to head the office of veterans affairs.
I don't know if you know any long history of the va. But let me five you a clue. The first whistle blower protection act was placed vlby george bush Sr back in roughly 1986 meaning the va had bad integrity issues way, way, way back before this nit wit attempt placment.
Their biggest problems are they have about 49,000 job vacancies and an antiquated computer scheduling system. It is an amazing organization doing an amazing job. My dad received wonderful care through the clinic here



Disabled Veteran here.  My 5+ long year fight continues against the Veterans Benefit Administration - not one ounce of help, just delay, delay, delay until they decide when I can take them to court!  Disgusting!  Fire all the VBA decision review officers that get paid to deny!
@WhiteHouse @wwp Should be called wounded male soldiers project. Way to represent. #wwp #boysclub #profitsoverpeople
Is this the same wounded warriors project that misappropriated funds in Las Vegas I hope you did your homework
Spanky Bone Spurs, the inspirational babbler.

Thank you sir
A draft dodger and his illegal Russian spy wife. It's no more absurd to say than to discredit Obama's birth certificate.

Missed it.
Did he talk about his bone spurs?
Or the troops he will send off to war?
Of course, @realDonaldTrump speaks at a charity that is questionable re actual distribution of monies to vets.Instead of throwing your $$ away, please support these fine organizations:
Fisher House Foundation 
Gary Sinise Foundation
Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society
Semper Fi Fund
. @WhiteHouse Do you know how stupid "deliver remarks" sounds, especially when all 45 can do is rant and repeat himself?
All vets should be equal. Why do these vets gets get treated special butI the Vietnam vets and Korean vets plus WWII vets get less benefits. Than these guys. #POTUS #RealDonaldTrump
Oh!! He was LIVE?


#WIMP

."You know, if it weren't for my very serious bone spurs condition, I would have been the greatest warrior of the Vietnam era, because no one would be a greater warrior than me. Believe me, I would have won that war and a Trump Tower would be in Hanoi today."

I actually am looking forward to reviewing donny's performance on FOX and FRIENDS...from the many news and legal sources I hear it was...revealing.

I wonder if Mr Cohen is not only pleading the fifth, but drinking a fifth as well... hmmm
Yes,  lets all watch him stroke his ego,  we all know its not about the vets...  He will just talk about himself, congratulate himself and speak in the third person lol
We know that @realDonaldTrump is a five time draft dodger so he wouldn’t care but the rest of you dimwits need to realize that only 2% of the funds collected by the Wounded Warrior Project reaches Wounded warriors.

Trump Attacks McCain for Being Prisoner of War: 'I Like People That Weren't Captured'
Yeah I do to. But not great choice of words by Trump I can say that.
The same Wounded Warrior Project that embezzled monetary donations to give top officials millions dollar salaries and big skiing in entrance conventions at Colorado Springs! Figures he would support them, they took money away from wounded warriors and sent them stickers instead!
While we still are not doing enough for our Wounded Warriors and many veterans. #DamnShame
Cadet bone spurs should apologize.
Can't help but notice. If Republicans actually got behind vets and funded staffed VA we wouldn't need the dog and pony show for these organizations
Maybe is The Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride a good thing - but in connection with #NotAPresident & #BigRocketMan Trump... I‘m not sure if it is a honor...

Take care of our Veteran and build strong border.
Our Veteran sacrificed their life for us and what they get ? A bunch of Illegal Immigrants !
No more !
Immigrants live in our country that's built by our blood.
They must respect our country, our flag, our Veteran.
#Respect #Maga
Trump is really stupid. After trying to destroy VA trump goes to talk to veterans. Hope they threw him out.
NEVER FORGET the fakery of a phony Potus who dares to speak to others of their patriotism and their courage.


Why, does he want more to inflict more misery in their lives?

We appreciate all your work in these difficult times President Trump. We are supporting Wounded Warriors & many others will too. Please know we also pray for our veterans, military & for you. MAGA!
Not worth a response!!!!

Ask the wounded warriors how well their pain is controlled
Two words, bone spurs
No Thank you. Already have a good idea about what this draft dodger will say.
Thanks to all the ways mr.president you are helping us,and all veterans, military, police officer, and all patriots, and family members and caregivers. God bless you and God bless AMERICA

"I don't like giverinners "
Living Wage for the Military!? 25% of military families are on Food Stamps!!!! Pay them a living wage and stop the vacuous prattle!! 600,000 military visit Food Banks to feed their families! So cut the Bull Shit and pay the military a Living Wage! These are words of a vet!!
Speaking of military pay, early on for roughly the first 5 to 6 years it's rough lousy wages. But they feed you free food and give free room and board.. so not sure why or where you got that stat..
That's right. Trump, himself, receive a Purple Heart. It was a gift from a fan, not earned in honorable service of his country.
ARE THEY AWARE THAT IT DODGED THE DRAFT AND THEY TOOK ITS PLACE....you could not believe it if it were not in front of your face. Draft dodger praises those who did not have a sore toe.
That corrupt organization that gives less than 50% of charitable contributions to the folks they are suppose to serve.  SAD
I would like to see the recognition of our Army contractors. How many of them injured or killed ppl have no idea. #AIG needs scrutiny because of the way they treating these injured workers with threats and actual harmful acts AIG has done.Somebody have to take care of contractors

Nope.


Ok
Please let him know bone spurs don't count. #Fivedeferments #hypocrite
So proud of our Soldiers!


@WWP #WoundedWarriorProject is GUILTY of #VeteranProfiteering (back-loaded #WarProfiteering) in the WORST way--taking advantage of the injured. #GeorgeWBush was paid 100k by these crooks to talk to #Soldiers injured in #PointlessWars.
Hate to tell you, but most wars are for the most part pointless as far as I can tell.
@maddow He has no credibility...when he speaks he lies, misrepresents and degrades ppl, agency’s and democracy...a modern day Benedict Arnold...action show an incompetent, blowhard with little knowledge of how the country and government works. A Bozo, con man, Wizard of Oz...
i think it's pretty effing disrespectful that a draft dodger would deliver any remarks to someone in uniform.
The same organization that was guilty of defrauding donors and misuse of donor money.

Ok
Will he bring his deferments?
Gutless traitorous freak shouldn't be in the same room as vets

Cadet bone spurs will only deliver embarrassment.
Donny just saw you on tv your not looking to good aliddle puffey or maybe just fat  enjoy
You could have given millions to wounded veterans,if only you had shownus your Taxes,what do ya think Donnie #pleasestoplyingtousyouGiantAssHat
Where was trump when it was his duty to serve his country?
He mentioned VA accountability. Where's your accountability trump?
He has been for the most part. Yes there are no doubt some issues, but the liberal media does a usual distort the stats and facts.
#SexualPredatorTrump
Why would I watch a dog and pony show??? Liar n pussygrabber
@realDonaldTrump

Oh Joy! Cadet Bone Spurs is going to deliver some remarks. Maybe he'll offer up some of the sage words he used in this song.
It makes me sick the watch him preen and lie... Pussygrabber lies
Nope! Not going to watch him make an ass of himself and listen to him lie.

Well it's a round about way of getting there so to speak.

No thank you.


Respect veterans. Will take a REAL HARD PASS on listening to -45. Thanks but, Nah.

Can’t wait till Saturday night rally. President Trump is so much fun.
Better than anything on TV
How do our wounded soldiers feel about a draft dodger that used his Daddy's money to stay out and party while his classmates came home in black bags?
Do you think I should have to close my business to protest a store poisoning our community? Citizens were being arrested for possession, hospitalized and murdered
@WWP #WWP #WoundedWarriorProject is GUILTY of #VeteranProfiteering (back-loaded #WarProfiteering) in the WORST way--taking advantage of the injured. #GeorgeWBush was paid 100k by these crooks to talk to #Soldiers injured in his #PointlessWars. WTF
WWP, what a joke. Look at the administration overhead cost. Why anyone would donate to them is beyond me.
No thanks. I heard his lies already today.
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other.

Don the Con said Michael Cohen represented him the "crazy Stormy Daniels deal". Also Cohen represented him in a "tiny tiny little fraction" of his overall legal work. There goes A/C. Oopsie!
His remarks on Fox this morning are much more interesting.
Did Trump tell them about his bone spurs? #cadetbonespurs
Over/under on how many minutes into the speech Trump says something embarrassing?  I say 1.5
Maybe Trump can have Kanye join him in his  speech, the two of them both know everything about everything! Both extreme Morons...
That's ironic...they hate Trump
This old USAF vet's skin crawls whenever DRAFT DODGING COWARD IN CHIEF COMRADE BONER SPUR gets near my fellow veterans,active men&women who SERVE,SERVED in uniform. WE DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS CHICKENSHIT BOY!
USAF ...you were almost in the military
YEP but I'll wager you didn't mind the F-105s(Flying Bricks) dropping Napalm,BOMBS to keep you REAL MILITARY COMBAT VETS ALIVE.
Trump’s message: I wanted your VA headed by a complete amateur. Remember Trump’s goal (Putin’s goal) is to dismantle our government.
How about you get the VA a good leader, no crooks. Show your taxes, give the millions of dollars for the military parade that is for you to our veterans who deserve it and quit lying and being a crook. It isn’t about you donny.

I support the WWP, but not the 5 time draft dodger who said his foot hurt, only likes veterans that weren't captured, and veterans with PTSD are weak.
but you support a charity that takes in millions a year but only gives back pennies on the dollar to the vets as @wwp CEO takes home nearly 300,000 a yr.
I support the wounded veterans,  period.  Every dollar helps and counts.
Why, he just blathers on about what he calls fake news. Bone Spur General

Been wondering all morning after the pathetic live interview on fox ... which one has a higher IQ?
Our wounded warriors have been through enough, why subject them to this?
Because he wants to gas light them he’s despicable.
No!
Hope he doesn't insult McCain while talking about the brave soldiers this time.

Long past due, and very possible to do even in the next 10 years if, there is a big push.
