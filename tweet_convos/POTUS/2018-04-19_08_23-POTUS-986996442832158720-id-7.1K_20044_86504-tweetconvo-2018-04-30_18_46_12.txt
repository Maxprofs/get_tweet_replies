I have serious differences with James Comey over his handling of the email investigation, but on two points, I am in solid agreement: Donald Trump does not reflect the values of America and is morally unfit to be President.
Californians continue to take our great state back ! Get rid of the “looney” democrats.... vote them out of office !
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Good Morning! Thanks to all the "Great" people of @SanDiegoCounty for supporting your #ImmigrationAgenda and working hard to keep the #America people and @VisitCA safe by securing their "Southern Border".

The rule of law. Good one, sir.
Didn't Neil Gorsuch just kick you in the nuts
B S talks 
Too bad Judge Gorsuch didn't defend the rule of law.  I think he might be a problem.
Dangerous policies? The most dangerous reality in the world today is Donald Trump
What dangerous policies? Killing ISIS, increasing  the workforce, energy independence, Summit with North Korea to try for denuclearization? Sounds like excellent reality policies to fair minded ppl.
They just say the buzz words that their handlers have programmed them to say regardless that there are zero facts to back up their idiotic claims.
California has a huge homeless problem. We need to set up roadblocks so people coming out of California can we searched.

Pics or it didn't happen.
You’ll definitely have a cough, and you may have various problems with breathing, such as:
• Chest congestion, where your chest feels full or clogged.
• A cough that may bring up a lot of mucus that’s clear or.....
As opposed to Washington, where they end up in your cabinet.

Your kakistocracy is collapsing after its lamentable journey.  As the greatest Nation history has known, we have the opportunity to emerge from this nightmare stronger & more committed to ensuring a better life for all Americans, including those you have so tragically deceived. …
We are all Americans.   We are not all Trumpists

That includes you, Alexander.

You have no room to talk about protecting citizens. Flint, MI and Puerto Rico have citizens that need our help, yet you do nothing. Except golf and screw hookers. You are a joke.

Don't worry about California. We're cool. Worry about the unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' now at the WH; housing violent criminals, putting all Americans at risk.

You lost the popular vote
Fear mongering at its finest (as usual).
You are a huge stain on the rule of law. You are a huge stain on America and what most Americans actually want!
Funny his approval ratings say otherwise lol. Don't speak for most of us Americans, because you really don't know us.
Karen McDougal's story provides a detailed look at the way Donald Trump and his allies used clandestine hotel-room meetings, payoffs, and complex legal agreements to keep his affairs out of the press:
Dear Mr. President as you can see who the people are waiting to stab you in the back on the Republican side to watch yourself and get them all the criminals

Hilarious! YOU WANT THE TRUTH & yet support the illegal president also known as John Barron, David Dennison and John Miller (to name a few) depending on which corrupt deed he is pulling off.  His lies have topped ALL officials combined in US history! YOU sir, are a FAKE Patriot!
1. We just had an illegal president for 8yrs. CIA construct, records sealed.
Why?
Barack Obama=Barry Soetoro
The name he used as a foreign student.
Barack Obama=
Harrison J Bounel share home address & social security number.
Used a pseudonym emailing HRC
WHILE president. Why?
Oh no, a conspiracy quack.  Or a Russian bot - either way "Bye bye"!

What is a libturd.
It's one if a handful of words conservatives use to insult liberals while simultaneously claiming they never insult liberals and everything a conservative says is cold, logical fact.

You see, key components to being a US Conservative are hypocrisy, and a lack of self-awareness.
Who said I was a conservative ?fake news cnn
Oh, my bad. I didn't realize you were a meaningless troll.

But also, I didn't say *you* were a conservative at all. Way to make it all about you, though.

Mr. President you’re doing a fabulous job sir if we can get rid of Pelosi and Feinstein we can make California Golden again @JoinTravisAllen @RealErinCruz #MCGA
Remember when Republican were all about State's rights?  Good times, good times.
State rights to break federal law? When did the republican party allow that?
Yes! Please!!!
Truthfully...california needs to follow suit. This is ridiculous unless things change and by that I mean, LAWS CHANGE, then we must defend our borders and homeland...
#RacistDonaldTrump
Mr. President,  why are you going to court against CA.  Just enforce the rule of law us g the powers of the president.  The courts ARE NOT THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE LAND despite recent misguided practice.
Very awesome that you connect with people like you do Mr president..  #MAGA
Amen
You need to respect the constitution
The court case they won and you lost you mean which means that actually those policies are legal and constitutional So sad so bad.
Polls, ratings in the toilet. Resign slime ball.
Can any of the immigrants be any more dangerous than you?


*You’re
Wait, you’ve heard of the rule of law? That’s a surprise, since you don’t follow it.
Meanwhile,Republican criminals,are making plans to loot Social Security,Medicare,and Medicaid.Lock them up !
I'M not at risk.
Also Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Costa Mesa,and San Juan Capistrano! 
Do you know the first rule of #fightclub?
Glad to see San Diego County do the right thing.
When was the USA not the greatest country in the world? Have you live here for the last 50 years? If so you are the deaf, dumb and blind kid.
Before you come back there is a typo should be lived.
Great

Cry?
You don’t know what the rule of law is. There is no Trump law. You know that right? There is no Trump rule? You know that too right. Probably not...not that bright.
Hey look I am a bot let me spam shit
The criminals putting America at risk are you and your swamp buddies in the White House
Why are illegal aliens getting approved for drivers licenses? Arizona funds depleted by the BILLIONS!!! Illegals need to get drug tested to receive any type of assistance! Americans should've been first priority! Scholarships going to illegal immigrants! What about us Americans!
As a 5th generation Californian I thank you for working towards a safer California. I absolutely do not agree with the California state government in regards to "sancturary policies" - a slap in the face! So, thank you, I am with you on this disturbing subject.
Oops, that pesky judiciary rules ANOTHER of your ideas unconstitutional. Is there anybody in your circus that knows the law? Certainly not Sessions
Ha. Courts note only congress can do what you illegally attempted to do. You lose.
You lose the case

What the hell does con artist comrade Trump know about the rule of law? Ever hear of Trump University?
Those violent criminal women w babies and children? Those criminals??
Remind me of your pardons
Wow!
All possible because of the outstanding leadership by our #President #PresidentTrump best president in the history of #America




This is sad &horrifying beyond all description-how can anyone in their right mind murder babies?Deepest part of hell reserved for murderers of innocent children #PP they sell the body parts-no remorse-all support #PresidentTrump & ppl who don’t murder babies
Coming from you-based on your previous tweets & lack of spelling ability etc-I take that as high compliment having you call me a freak-
Mr. President, what are you going to do to help Puerto Rico ?????
@realDonaldTrump America first right? So why aren’t you helping the most struggling
You mean American territory.

Puerto Rico is a Caribbean island and unincorporated U.S. territory 
They voted against becoming a state until they were out of money and about bankrupt.
Ridiculous
Im just pointing out the facts.

But I'll take ridiculous from a flat earther as compliment.

Where in the Constitution does it state that sanctuary cities are illegal?
Your welcome boss!!!!

Spanky, since when do you care about ‘the rule of law’? Your whole life and administration has been about bypassing the ‘rule of law’.

The rule of law ... SEXUAL ASSAULT is against the rule of law ... see you in prison
Something tells me Abe bukkaked you without mercy these past few days.
Sir due long yrs  of mkt  economy a lot of poisonous byproducts have precipitated only to b treated with law or abandoned. But urs disowning might corrupt other countries. So time to act judiciously otherwise they may invade USA later on.
This is a significant win for Trump whi has marshalled people put upon by dipsy Brown to stand up for themseves and their communities. And btw putting Calif in play in 2020

Cool! How is Mexico going for you?
Hey, you're a criminal. What the hell makes you so special?
How
Hahahahaha YOU talking “rule of law” is HELLA FUNNY!! Man, it would be great if you quit being POTUS and went back to being on reality tv!!
- Don the Con takes the credit for Korea talks and adds he’ll bail. That’s his out if his con doesn’t work on Kim Jong Un!
Three cheers for #SanDiego!
I support you 100% Mr Trump! California should have got a vote regarding if we “wanted” to become a “sanctuary” state or not. I sir, DO NOT!
do you realize that it was YOUR representatives that voted to make it a sanctuary state, people that YOUR fellow Californians voted for? It's called a representative democracy mate
It
Fake news, again!
People don’t know that
You should probably stop waiting the term rule of law.  You literally break them on a daily basis.  You should say, rule of racist.
It must be embarrassing that during Abe's visit you don't have control over Democratics, women, children, disabled people, Black people, most religions or most Christians including the Pope, people more intelligent & educated than you or your base & a growing # of Republicans
Moon Beam could give two craps (Look at San Fran) about American born People - All about the illegals and refugees -
Dear Mr Precedent...eat my bum you orange skinned  tiny handed russian puppet...
Idiot
Empathy! Empathy empethy.
Police here don't aressest anybody. No criminals or people that do drugs. I say Lets start a war on criminals an drugs abusers. Please give the power to police to want to arrest bad people.
That's a laugh. YOU saying to defend the rule of law?
Do you have the remotest idea that you will not be in office much longer.  Best part? There will be many millions of people shouting LOCK HIM UP! 
Shut up and go away
KEEP ON TRUMPING
Haas Institute poll = 70% of Californians agree that immigrants strengthen our country through their hard work and talents.
73% agree that immigrants coming to the United States are doing enough to blend in to the American way of life
The danger is YOU Drumpf!

You are the biggest risk to Americans!
We are trying to do our best, but it isn’t easy with so much against from Sacramento.. please help..
TRAITOR
Fuck off already.
but what if they are innocent? Like Steven Avery. Start getting the innocent out and busting corrupt police departments
If they are illegal, they are illegal, they are not innocent.
Another YES!! 
Thank you SAN DIEGO 
Liar
F*** off
Trump, I cannot save enough. You are a menace you are a terrorist, a Russian operative and you’re illiterate and ugly. We are going to take you out using the justice system. I hope they decide to hang you but I don’t think they do that anymore. For you, I can make an exception

با نگاهی مثبت اقدام دولت ایالات متحده را برای شروع مذاکرات خلع…
lol he is defending the rule of law and TRUMP THINKS HE IS ABOVE THE LAW IMAGINE THAT
If Trump has nothing to hide, why hasn't he released his tax returns like he promised?!? The IRS audit excuse was obviously yet another lie.
Most of us in San Diego hate you.
“Dangerous Violent Risk” Get the fuck out of here.
Americans are at risk while you are in office.
Showem your support 
Proud of #SanDiego #County 4 standing up against stupid #Moonbeam.
We are being invaded thru southern border please Make this a top priority
Actually, the only thing putting America at risk is you. Your mouth, your actions, and your lack of actions jeopardizes Americans everyday.

Gan?
God bless our President Trump and teams San Diego’s care Vote Trump  2018
Keep our name out your mouth. Sincerely, San Diego
Violent Criminals afoot in the White House 
You lose again.
BREAKING: Appeals court rules against Trump policy punishing sanctuary cities https://politi.co/2vrPWJh  
I think I will vacation in San Diego instead of San Fran! It’s much safer!
This is was our deal when we elected you, Mr. President @realDonaldTrump.
You are the most dangerous person in American History you orange dotard!
Best part is, I'd bet 50% of the respondents, or more here (Including Orange One), don't  ACTUALLY know what makes a sanctuary city.
 And how/why they got the designation and still do push back against feds. 
But do carry on.
