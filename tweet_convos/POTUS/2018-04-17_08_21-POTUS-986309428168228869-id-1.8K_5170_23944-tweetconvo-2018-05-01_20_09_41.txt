Trump’s #taxscam is proven to have no benefit for the working class!
Funny, I have over $125 each month in my paycheck that wasn't there before.
Pay attention people. These so called cuts have an expiration date. Not the ones for the rich though. Trumps crony’s get what they want by dangling carrots in front of you.
I've paid and overpaid on taxes since 2013 this year I got a return nobody's dangling anything
Pay attention, class.  The cuts expire in 2025. But not for the upper class. That’s when their cuts become permanent. For heaven’s sake, stop being sheep.
The sad thing is that these #trump sheep have been lied to for so long that facts terrify them.
They are thoroughly brainwashed little people who don’t want to know the truth.
Very pitiful.
We seen the untruth for 8 years under the Democrats so rave on!
I love the extra 10 dollars.  I’ve funded a trip to Europe and bought a new car.


Some of these jerk-offs actually go down on Trump. @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @SenBobCorker @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @marcorubio @VP
Propaganda
You’re all going to jail, and we’re going to sell off your assets to pay down the deficit.
Please arrest these people what's going on i am praying for our president and justice come on restore our trust arrest these swap monsters
Trumpsters are happy with any Crumbs they get thrown their way rather than looking at the bigger picture. Even those so called $1000 bonuses- what a joke
True!
No clue what that supposed to mean
The Clinton Foundation raised donations for Haiti then keep 95%. They awarded family and freinds with contracts to build housing and manufacturing plants which were never completed. Another Crooked Hillary scheme
At the age of 76 I am still a full time hard working taxpayer. So far I have seen very little in the tax scam that is looking out for me. You gave lots of child care credit but nothing for us older folks who raised kids without those credits.  You even took away some deductions.
Guess what?  Now you will fall into a smaller tax bracket and your standard deduction just doubled!!!
CBO's latest current tax law projections, trillion-dollar deficits will  return in 2020, the debt will grow to 96% of GDP ($28.7 T) by 2028, the  highest since 1946. CBO's latest projections find that by 2025, current  law deficits will total $1.5 T, or 5.1% of GDP.

I have an idea! What about making the tax cuts only for lower class! ITS GENIUS
The lower class don't pay any! They get money back out of my pocket!
Thank you for the tax cuts and reform! So greatly appreciated!
Amen !! Wait,  was I allowed to say that on this platform?
I have worked my way through all the intricate details of this tax plan, also considering new trade laws, and the math makes sense for once in our lives! Good plan! This Dem LOVES!!!
For posterity’s sake:

out with the old Sarah Sanders in with the new Sponge Bob White House spokessponge.
Please tell me this means you’re retiring.


This was all for the upper 1% of the people. TAX CUTS NEVER work for for the working people. RESIGN NOW CARNIVAL BARKER
Define the 1% please.   Income earners or those that already accumulated large wealth and no longer work for a paycheck?
Remember how they're going to pay for their tax cuts for the wealthy! Vote BLUE
I see you @RepHuizenga
Dear #GOP -- Why isn't your #POTUS filing his #TAXES on #TaxDay?
Since the #TrumpTaxScam RAISED the taxes of Middle Class Home Owners in: NY, NJ, MA, MI, MD, VA, IL, CA, NM, PA, CT, NH, WA, OR...

And since this is written in the LAW, one has to come to the question: 
WTF are you talking about?
Thank you President Trump for the nice pay raise. I did not get a pay raise the whole time Obama was in office. You truly care for us.
#GOPTaxScam is only benefiting the top 1%
I’ve gotten an extra $74 a week in my check and I’m middle class.
Amazing!!!!!!!

I get an extra $74 a week in my paycheck,that about $300 s month which is pretty good I’d say...$300 more than Obama gave me in the 8 years he was in office
Propaganda!  Recession/Inflation to hit Taxpayers soon; as, tax cuts to go to wealthy & WH Administration’s frivolous spending is out of control!
@POTUS "Out with the old, in with the new" - an excellent slogan for the election in 2020. Combine that with the hashtag #FlushTheTrumpToilet & the @DNC is ready for 2020. 
Yah sure right...maybe in Trumptovia, or Trumpsylvania.

If your plan is to try for some positive news/press/spin, touting a tax cut for the wealthy isn't gonna do it!
Yes, thanks for that “Tremendous Relief” comrade. I’m not sure where to begin to spend the $16.37 increase per month. It’s overwhelming
Can’t even buy three Starbucks.

IMPEACH THIS LOSER ALREADY
When we began our push for tax cuts, I promised that our bill would result in more jobs, higher wages & tremendous relief for middle -class families & that is exactly what we have delivered. “PROMISES MADE & PROMISES KEPT “ Thank you to President Trump. #TaxCutsandJobsAct
My rich GOP donors are going to be much richer, believe me!
Hubby works as a tool and die guy in a carbide factory here in MI and he owns a small business. At the factory they got bonuses AND raises! We got our taxes done and we were VERY happy with our return. We didn't do too badly at all for a married couple with no children.
Wait until next year. We get shafted in the middle class. Lots of deductions like mortgage interest going away.
Despite the windfall of a big tax cut, Devon Energy is laying off another 300 employees.” “Devon also began a $2 billion stock and debt buyback plan.” #TaxDay #GOPTaxScam
Probably a poorly run company with bad policies!
Lies. Propaganda. Yawn.
As Trump gives himself a billion dollar tax cut !

RIGGED! 

1. Trump BORROWED $1,5000,000,000,000.00 -1.5 trillion 
2. Trump gave himself + Top 1% richest 83% of it
3. GOP supported this crime 100% 
4. 100% democrats opposed it.
5. The Media buried story
Propaganda...you’re pandering for adoration from your base. You’re addicted to “ratings” and you appear anything BUT stable. Or genius for that matter.
There is no reform. It’s just tax cuts, like Crooked Lying Don said, for the rich and his family. Nut jobs fill up rural America. Lol lol lol
Lies, from a deceitful Administration, Congress and POTUS. Tax Cuts for the rich, corporations and pennies for everyday Americans. #TaxScamBill
Will @realDonaldTrump show his tax returns?

Keep it up Mr President, proud I voted for you!
3.5 million moved from tax heavy blue states to tax relief in read states. Quit being sheep. Read the news. This happened in the last 18 months. Go Trump.
Or stay and clean house! Vote red republican local, state & fed and your fellow states and neighbors will help rebuild!? First cleanse out blue! Then- we rebuild! With love- to all you blue states- signed ohio
Lies, lies, and more lies. There has been no “tremendous” impact on middle class paychecks. Saying it does not make it so.
You DO realize that Donald Trump RAISED my money taxes so he could cut *his* taxes, right?

You sh1theads really want to remind me of this?!?!
The truth won't be available until tax season 2019. I am betting that people singing glory to extra money find their taxes were under withheld for a year.
And when are these tax cuts due to expire for the middle class? 2025 wasn’t it?  The same time the tax cuts for his rich crony’s become permanent. Sneaky, conniving treacherous thieves.
Tell Trump we want to see his tax returns.

Tax break was not applicable to the 2017 tax year.
Trying to distract us because your stolen SCOTUS appointee is giving you gorsuch a hard time?
So will Trump release his taxes so we can see how much he will benefit from the tax cuts?  Probably not because then people would see how much of a cheat he is.
Tax cuts for the wealthy, adding trillions to the debt, cuts that look out for the hardlyworking millionaires and billionaires. #TaxScam Where is the chief clown? Hitting the links again at our expense?

Saying it over and over doesn't make it true.  We know that's your strategy but we're not all stupid.
Out with the old, in with the new. Finally you are admitting that Trump(out with the old) needs to be out and a new competent person needs to be put in as President(in with the new).

Here’s a reminder that President Donald J. Trump has not only refused to reveal his tax returns like he repeatedly promised, but he's bragged about how little money he's paid to the IRS.

There were no meetings with Russians, except for the meetings with Russians. The meetings with Russians were not abt Russia, except for the parts that were abt Russia. There was no follow-up after the meeting with Russians abt Russia, except by ppl who followed up after meeting.
There's no reforms just taxs cut for the rich !!!#
So when will you produce your tax returns?  Failure to do so is just another lie on your part.

Trump said the The White House has no name.  He said it is called The Tippy Top bldg/house. Explain.
ugh... sigh...

My tax cut....

$25.00 per week for a family of 4.

Are you listening? Donald? Pence?

$6.25 per week per person. 2 adults, 2 teens.

What can you do with $6.25 per person per week? Not much.

You clowns are nothing but con men.
Thank you Mr. Trump!!! 
Totally Not what you crammed down America's throat. Higher wages!? Oh wait I get it now, your saying that the working poor don't work hard enough, cause you sure don't give a flip about us!
Well said!
Wages have not gone up and In Hollywood, Fl we are paying 2.9 for a Gallon of gas. and Rentals are between $120 to $150 per sq ft about 10% higher than at the end of 2016...No thank you #dotard
BS
Hooray, the typical middle class American is paying a higher percentage of his or her income in taxes than is the typical multi-millionaire or billionaire American. The Trump-Republican tax act will make this even worse, starting this tax year.
Be sure to ask your accountant how much you'll owe NEXT year. Our modest paycheck increase is outstripped by the THOUSANDS more we will owe next year without a pay increase. #WheresMyTaxCut

Only reason wages are higher is because of we the people. We the people voted for wage increases in our state. I don’t see the Republicans increasing federal minimum wage. It’s against their policy.

Wages are stagnant, only 27% think this cut is good. Trump gets at least 61k in tax cuts and more for his businesses. The middle gets under 1000 and nothing because of health insurance increases. People know this is a scam
