What should matter to all Americans is that the President of the free world Obstructed Justice. 
Trump's statements linking Russia investigation to Comey firing could lead to legal problems
President Trump: This Russia Thing is a Made Up Story https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/president-trump-this-russia-thing-is-a-made-up-story-941962819745 … via @NBCNightlyNews

If you watch news from someone not working for CNN you might find the truth! Although I doubt you have the sense to try before youtype!
I hope you are not referring to Fox News because it isn't even classified as a news station. It is an entertainment channel.
The reason Fox News is so successful is because it offers fact based reporting with good conservative commentary. Conservatives are more interested in real politics and world events than liberals who choose to get their news from sources like The View and Saturday Night Live.
That is funny. I get entertainment from SNL and I never have watched the View. Fox is an entertainment network that loosely includes the facts if and only if it matches their views. Conservatives are willing to be complicit while allowing the executive branch to overstep laws.
The problem is people who get entertainment from sources like SNL often fail to differentiate comedy skits from real life. And of course, no one overstepped the executive branch like Obama.

A blue wave is coming
He dumb
James Comey’s ABC Interview Is Tonight. Catch Up on the Feud.
Comey will be on Colbert's show Tuesday night. I'm looking forward to seeing how Colbert handles the interview.
Hopefully like he should...As a joke. I mean Comey and Colbert... Two jokes sharing a stage.
While Colbert is surely amusing, he's also a man with intelligence and compassion - two attributes found lacking in Donnie J. 
I'm interested in seeing more of Comey, to get a better "read" on how he comports himself.
Colbert, amusing, and intelligence...All in the same sentence... Wow, never imagined it possible to be so lost in detritus that one could ever put a sentence like that together. COLBERT IS A COMEDIAN. His work is done by writers. He's no where close to that intelligent.
Like many successful comedians, Colbert is brilliant in his own right. He didn't get to where he is today, with LOYAL and appreciative audiences, by riding in on his daddy's wealthy coattails. Nor is he scandal-ridden like DJT. Donnie is the one who is nowhere near intelligent.
So, wait, you're comparing a comedian, that reads his jokes to an audience, to a Billionaire President? You need to seriously get your thinking cap on straight. Quit listening to the news and pay attention to what's actually going on in the real world. Colbert's a COMEDIAN.
Colbert is a talented satirist and comedian. DJT is a guy who schemed his way into our White House, most likely with the help of Russian vote tampering & money laundering. 
I'll say no more on this subject, because it's clear we're too far apart to agree.
Blah, blah, blah. Not a word about the March for Science? You know something real, that actually matters. I think I know why .  .  .
President Obama is 100% more credible & better liked than you Lying Trump!!! You are for Russia not the USA!!!
BLOW YOUR OWN TRUMPET because if true, we. Really do not care! Just like you do not care!  Now, take that with a bag of chips. You are still dirty and nasty like Carson! Like Pruitt!
Today is tax day! A big windfall for the wealthiest Americans.  I want pollution free air, clean water, and protection to wildlife. This administration is harming America and breaks laws.  No taxation without representation!
Tax day is tomorrow, the 17th.
Because it fell on the weekend.  Sorry 
It is great to hear someone speak the truth about you. Your sycophants are all too worried about you destroying their careers. Most quit before that tho.
I just might pull an all nighter waiting for you to wake up. I don’t miss any of your tweet storm. #TrumpMorallyUnfitForOffice #ComeyInterview
I’m thinking the same thing!  It’s going to be hilarious!  Can’t wait to see what Quasimodo has to say in the subject too!

Racist administration is doing all it can to keep America white.
Your obsession with President Obama is starting to sound like someone is in love. Just say it already. You’ll feel so much better.
Quack
So only half of the Republicans polled approve of the job you're doing?
In your wildest dreams

You know we don't like you and the fact that you feel the need to compete with people who are not in office and constantly bring up stories about people who are not competing with you is pathetic.
No leaks about Awan spy ring in Congress, but Cohen eating a hamburger with a Russian in New York,  leaked...
Moustaf the smuggler as a panelist, the same Arab spring,  Libya fiasco,  now Syrian Task Force, a la Christian, Yezidi orphanages for Islamic sex slavery markets
Yep
Yep
And yep again 
Yep
Yep
Yep
Yep
Yep

Thankyou Mr. President, we Thankyou for your tremendous efforts!


The president always goes through a doorway first. Everybody is to make way for the president. This is pre-Trump. The president is to always be first through a doorway or moving to a new room or entering a room. Nice try
The only problem with that is that at the time of that photo guess who was still president? Trumpty dumpty had not yet been sworn in.
There is a cultural difference that people are missing. If you are Western, the most important person enters a room first. If you are Eastern, the last person to enter is the most important.
That is why most people open the door to let people in, respect.
Sorry, other Presidents didn’t behave this way. There are even videos to prove it. Clinton, Bush Sr., Bush, and Obama’s did not behave like this at the inauguration. Not only that, Trump slammed a car door in his wife’s face, let her get rained on while he was under the unbrella

I simply can't
The kind thing to say would be “Bless you heart” but since you have no heart, even that would be a waste of breath.
#FakePresident

Had to steal it! 
Thank you for your service!
Hopefully a competent person will be POTUS in 2020 or sooner! 
Trump is great at one thing, deflecting the attention with another distraction! Some of his followers are catching on, others are still easily conned & will stay that way!
Here’s bunch of REAL polls (via @Twitter, @ABC News, @FoxNews) showing u & @GOP have almost ZERO CREDIBILITY vs. James @Comey (97% believe him); PUBLIC will TAKE 2 STREETS if u “FIRE” Rosenstein; 7 of 10 support Mueller’s investigations in2 COLLUSION, ur BUSINESSES & NDA PAYOFF$!
More BAD polls for u, @POTUS Trump: Clear majorities believe in @FBI & @DOJ investigations & NOT FIRING Mueller, Rosenstein & Sessions; 83% of respondents feel @MichaelCohen212 BROKE law, will IMPLICATE & FLIP on u; 72% cite U & RUSSIA 4 #BadBlood; & 86% DISSAPPROVE u#RESIGN


With each passing day, more & more “reformed Republicans” tentatively place their Twitter foot on the left side. Welcome them warmly. Show them the respect they deserve for questioning their prior beliefs. It takes a strong heart to admit you were wrong. Introduce them to others.
Use caution. Vet them. I have yet to find an insincere one. Some of them voted GOP all of their lives, some, generations. They are genuinely horrified by the direction the right have taken. Trump has brought out the worst of the worst in their party. Recovering Republicans search
Recovering Republicans search for the values their party has lost. I remember the GOP of yesterday. They were staunch patriots who loved our country & fought hard for our way of life. They were Conservatives. Intelligent, interesting, dignified men, who always put country first.
Today’s GOP doesn’t hold a candle to the Republican Party my parents supported. My father would be bitterly disappointed by these people. I do thank God my father isn’t alive to see this. I sympathize with the recovering Republican. Just put yourself in their shoes.Pray for them.
Welcome them to our party. Talk to them, it’s easier than you might think. The division launched by foreign enemies, & enforced by Trump & his party is manufactured. Recovering Republicans aren’t haters & bullies, they’re American patriots, just like us. They want the same things
They are leaving the Republican Party because today’s GOP isn’t what they want. The excessive spending is a huge bone of contention. Trumps spendthrift ways, his admin’s ridiculous waste, the fraud tax break for the wealthy. These things bother them as much as they do all of us.
Adding 1.5 trillion to the deficit that future generations face is one of the main reasons why so many Republicans are leaving their party. Trumps trade war is another. His cavalier attitude towards the very people who voted for him has not gone unnoticed. Be kind to R. refugees.
This guy......celebrating getting and F on his report card.
Must you spend your time & energy bragging about lies that you tell? I'm convinced someone dropped you on your head as an infant. No other excuse for your disrepectful behavior.  I'll be so happy when you vacate the White House.
Awesome. 

Best.
President.
Ever (except GW & Lincoln)
I'll bet President Trump will be right up there side by side, shoulder to shoulder with GW and Lincoln. He's handling foes from all sides and winning.
GW set every precedent with his actions fully in mind for how future generations would act.
Did #RonnyJacksonMD leave you the key to the White House pharmacy?
TWEET TO FOLLOWERS
You are rife with jealousy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton, aren't you, my little man?  Every time you say something unflattering about them, we Dems have to chuckle at your envy, jealousy and childlessness.  Your words are sooooo revealing!  Tee Hee!
You got that right: it IS hard to believe.
I am sooo proud and amazed that President Trump has accomplished so much even while relentless attacks by crazy liberals. Way to go !!!
FAKE!
RT @realDonaldTrump  Just remember, Good or Bad; all Polls are fake numbers & bias. Just like #FakeNews, all of these Polls are #FakePolls. YOU have so much that YOU should/need to be doing & accomplishing; instead of talking about nonsense. #USA #WeThePeople #Americans #America

Trump Hits 51% Approval
  In The Rasmussen Poll
Much Higher Than Obama 
AT THE SAME POINT

See For Yourself

Nice nose ring ... are you single? Asking for this guy.

Linda your outfit SCREAMS maga 
REPUBLICANS ARE ME ME ME PEOPLE NEVER SEEN SUCH A INFESTSTION OF PARICITES LIARS CON ARTISTS CHEATS CRIMINALS HOW EMBARRISING cŕeepy types
Hi
Obama was way better then u

What, no tweets this morning? Did you not watch the #ComeyInterview like the rest of the world? It was the biggest audience ever!
Nah, only sheep watch those channels sorry. Go elsewhere for real stories
Says the sheep who blindly believes the fake news that comes out of trump’s mouth on a daily basis.
You obviously didn't watch any of Trumps speeches and all the things he promised, he has been fulfilling his promises rapidly, even with many politicians working against him. Unheard of that politicians actually keep their promises
Which promises has he been fulfilling?
There's no use in trying to reason with someone who relies on the lies of a dishonest president and his administration.
I’m aware of that. It’s sad but true.
Trumps better than any of the other options
Last time you quoted Rasmussen Poll, you lied. It was 51% disapproval rate, not approval. Bet you lied again.
The vast majority DO NOT APPROVE! You are the most despised human on Earth!
Sorry spirt. You & your liberal commies are in the minority!
I don’t get the communism reference but yea trump does lie about his poll numbers. A LOT. So insecure.
That's because many of the polls are inaccurate man. The polls before the election were saying he had no chance, hillary had a 97% chance of winning. You will soon find out in November....especially if they make voter ID a thing....eliminating all the illegal alien votes.
If Hillary had a 97% chance of winning, that would make trump’s chance 3% not zero lol. You clearly don’t understand this process but doesn’t change the fact that trump lies about pole numbers all the time and constantly compares himself to Obama. Insecurity?
Because the polls and media are used to belittle him, if people believe the media / polls, they will think Trump has no chance, therefore why waste their vote on him....it's a deceptive tactic, so trump is basically forced to keep reminding his base that they are strong.
But his base is not strong. If it was people wouldn’t have to be “reminded”  it doesn’t really matter much anyway with the amount of legal trouble he’s in right now.
this is desperate and pathetic.
Thanks Mr. President
I am not sure how to take that pill. Please send a link. Thanks.
Things like replacing thousands of American workers with HB1 immigrants and allowing an unregulated industry like Uber to keep 40% of a riders fare while all of us lower and middle class scramble around wishing there were a few 'Crumbs' left over for us. #greatdepression2018
.@realDonaldTrump Did you think we forgot you said the exact same thing a week or two ago? You "just" hit 50%? Twice? 

No one cares about Rasmussen anyway. Look at all the other polls. You're still failing.
You really are weird. How many times do you have to promote your approval ratings, and compare it to previous presidents? Face it!!! Over 70% of the US Population cant stand you! You lost the popular vote! If you really want to be liked, shut your mouth and go hide in a room.
You are at 39%-42% in all other polls.
Good!  Americans are savvy; we are not nearly as naive or liberal as big media would have their viewers believe.  We are decent, honest, good people who want fair and equal to be just that, whether you're a teacher, a homemaker, a doctor, or the POTUS.  Stand tall, Mr. President!
In YOUR DREAMS!!!! LOSING!!
Wow 39% that’s awesome!!  Keep dreaming you POS!!
Fake news indeed
Omg! Why do you continually have to compare your ratings to others? This is not a tv show! Who cares? No one but you. #realnews
FAKE NEWS. Just look at my profile pic comrade Trump. As much as you want yours is never going to be as big as the black guys.
It wasn't because of the mantrump it was all about ideology. Everyone knows that.
Hello sir woh are you
you can bet it is a lot higher, remember they said Hillary was going to win
Astonishing how you never ask yourself why there is only 1 polling institute that shows good numbers for you. All others are conspiring against you and post fake numbers?
That doesn't seem to be very smart, you stable genius…
He meant to say the ramen noodle poll
Poll should be 70 percent approval
LiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiarLiar
WTF is wrong with you?

Travis Allen for California Governor!
The fact that you can't hide your lust for Putin—who has aggressively undermined & harmed America & is a lawless thug—while insulting & discrediting American institutions & people far better than you'll ever be makes you a vile waste of oxygen that history will never forgive.
The reason it's hard to believe is that it is not accurate.
Come on, STOP LYING!!! Lyin` Trump!!! 
Lyin`@realDonaldTrump 
Your approval ratings have NEVER been higher than Obama at any point!
And that 50% is just bullshit. You know it in reality is below 40%

Rasmussenis that Russian?
Yes, it is hard to believe.
Anything you say is hard to believe.
I don't appreciate the language you used here when talking to THE PRESIDENT! 
Some people were having a positive conversation, before you came along.
I never harass THE PRESIDENT and you should stop making assumptions regarding  people about whom you know nothing.
Rasmussen= fake news. You are a complete failiure by any serious standard
 Can't. Stop. Laughing.
Thanks Mr President for your fine leadership.  MAGA
Every one we ask shows 75% Approval. THE REAL DEAL POTUS.
Keep ur promises, PROTECT 2ND AMENDMENT, keep economy & stocks on the up&up.
#GOD BLESS POTUS & FLOTUS
You're delusional!!!
#tellthetruth!  Polls are at 39%
These same polls said Hillary would win in a landslide. Be careful what you believe.
54% DISAPPROVE OF YOU!!  Liar!!!!!! 
I love how jealous you are of Obama. 
Because Rasmussen is reputable, right? Your depravity and narcissism is growing day by day. It's not even news anymore when you do something despicable. And your retweets to promote yourself and cover your verbal vomit isn't fooling anybody. It's #MuellerTime! #TrumpForPrison
Nets getting tighter, dumb ass
I LOVE YOU
What?!  You just.NEVER.stop!?!!!
#Dumbdon keep dreaming!!!
As if that affects the price of eggs in China, widdle boy tinyhands...
Wow American s still actually believe in this guy. The rest of the world lol.
You are obsessed with Obama. Get over it. You won. Isn't that good enough for you. He is a private citizen now. A very good private citizen. Lay off. Stop being a jerk. Oh, don't expect him to visit you in the slammer.

You keep telling yourself that. If you are so well loved..why are you hiding from the Nerd Prom? You scared of the brilliant journalist that man the “Fake News”? (MSNBC CNN) You should be, they got your number. Oh..and they actually read!  
I want to know the latest development of zhang yingying's case.
God Bless you Mr. President !!!


For some reason, she looks stupid.  Just saying.

FAKE NEWS con man
Thanks for doing such a great job!
Russia....sanctions........not now......quid....pro......quo.....!

Shut up.
Your impeachment will get the ratings you’re hoping for.
It sure is hard to believe
Liar
The polls now are being released honestly when before they were intentionally deflated.   Only reason where seeing real polling data is the desire for us to start ww3.  All a sham as normal
u make the world worse
Hahahahaha in your old man dreams! You are the most hated disrespected fraud living in the WH! Nothing more.
HAHAHAHAHAHA, oh,  God, I just pissed myself laughing.  I wish it was on you,  but you would like that too much and I don't want hi think of you ever getting pleasure.  #goldenshowers #trumppeepeetapes
You are an abomination!!! #ResignNow
You are welcome

Americans are sick of all the havvock they are trying to create. Stay strong, keep working forAmwrica. It will be ok
Imagine what their poll results would be if the Deplorables were participating? A lot of us are holding back like in 2016. Looking forward to mid-term election surprises!!!!
Read a real poll! You are lucky to be at 39%! MORON IN CHIEF! How you feeling about that quality legal staff you have these days? Can’t wait till they prove your”ex-lawyer” is proven to have been in Prague! Want to bet?
You’ll NEVER even be half the man #PresidentObama is  your #potusenvy is showing again

But that's not a Rasmussen poll, so doesn't count.
@boettcherr see how trumpty dumpy is so obsessed with the great @BarackObama ? He will never be 1/3rd the honorable man our former “real” POTUS was !
अमेरिका के राष्ट्रपति सरजीत डोनाल्ड ट्रंप सर जी माननीय प्रधानमंत्री सर जी जो भी विदेशी यात्री आए सबके लिए उन्होंने प्रोटोकॉल तोड़ा है और सब को सम्मान के साथ भारत में लाए हैं कोई भी हो किसी भी देश के राष्ट्रीय अध्यक्ष आए हैं उनका स्वागत किया उनके परिवार का और भारतवासियों को बड़े
Trumpty Dumpty climbed up a wall.
 Trumpty Dumpty said, “I can’t fall.”
 Everyone wondered how far he could climb
 so full of himself
 and hot air all the time.
should be 98%!  We love you Mr. President!
Find a way to get #McConnell to retire and you can bump them up another 10 points  #MAGA
Only a real LOSER brags about having the support of only half of the people. I  never ran home as a child to brag about getting half of the questions right on an exam. But Trump sets the bar very low for himself and still trips over it!
The latest figures include 33% who Strongly Approve of the way Trump is performing and 41% who Strongly Disapprove,,,, you forgot this part....
Yes we are, what is wrong with the press?
50% of 1% maybe!!

Best
You are like a fat KID at a maltshop..."Grasping at straws!"
Go away with your lies

I find it extremely tasteless that you'd speak of someone YOU HIRED for this job in such a fashion.
Never. You could never be higher than him. Dream on, fat boy!
#روحت_شاد_رضاشاه روحت ـ شاد
It is truly a testament to your hard work in the face of MSM fake news. Probably would be higher if Sessions were doing his job and indicting the likes of McCabe, Comey and others.
Ma taci ogni tanto.
Fake poll.  Sad!  Destroying America.
No, sincere thank UUUUs to you Mr. President!  #MAGA
Should be higher! POTUS keeping promises, economy GREAT, foreign relations showing our POTUS/country strength. Trump loves USA KEEP MAJORITY
