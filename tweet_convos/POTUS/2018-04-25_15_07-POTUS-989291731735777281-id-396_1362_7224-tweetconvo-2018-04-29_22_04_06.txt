These attempted distractions are a HUGE FAIL.  We all heard Michael Cohen 'take the 5th.'  How embarrassing!  

Remember this:

"The mob takes the fifth. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?" — Donald Trump in 2016.

#MichaelCohen
Isn't that his constitutional right? There are many reasons to take it, many other than guilt.
But guilt is one of the reasons to take the fifth
Can be, but according to the law, cannot be assumed. I'll wait to see how things play out instead of assuming anything.
You are My President Trump.  Thank you and GOD BLESS

As if trump could lift a bowling ball. Pffft
They come in many different weights just so u no
Great defense 
Looks very regal. I’ve never seen it. Incredible! Thanks!!
Which is it? Regal? Or you've never seen it?
Are you joking? It’s RIGHT there! 

#CommonCore
If your ever in “Key West “ visit the the Truman little Whitehouse !
Cue the entire planet making jokes about how @realDonaldTrump’s fingers aren’t big enough to hold a bowling ball. 
When will Trump leave and #MAGA
January 20, 2025
Dear Mr President, may the angels in heaven wrap their beautiful wings around you and protect you like the softest, warmest blanket you have ever felt.
Seriously doubt Agent Orange is snuggle buddies with angels. #StormyDaniels
As an aspiring below average bowler, I was honored to roll the boards at the Truman Bowling Alley
I suck at bowling but would love to bowl there!
Nixon used this a lot.
Is there a dominoes room?
Have your horns, forked tongue, & tail grown out yet?
Trump sets record for number of scandals in the White House, and he's seldom there. #LockHimUp #StormyDaniels #Cohen #MuellerTime
  
Meanwhile most families can't afford to take the family to the bowling alley!
He doesn't accept a paycheck right now. Good thing we voted him in so he could stay there. He works for all of us.
He doesn't need to collect a paycheck. He had already spent over 90 million on his travel to his own properties. He is profiting every day he holds office. Looks like he drained the swamp and all the creatures are now in the WH & his administration. Sad!!
Like no other President ever traveled. At least it is to his own property and we are not having to foot the bill for that or overseas shopping trips on our dimes. It could be costing a lot more. I guess it was alright when it was a democrat spending like it was their money.
Obama spent the same amount but over a period of 8 years. Trump hasn't even been in office for 2 and is surpassing that. Trump is making money from rooms rented by secret service as well as their need to rent golf carts etc while protecting him on his over 100 golf games.
Can you link that information? I haven't heard that one before.
Since this profile only has 151 followers, it's probably just a Paid Bot spreading propaganda. I typically ignore these accounts. 
And on this day in 2018, Michael Cohen, @realDonaldTrump's personal lawyer and close personal aide, announced that he was pleading the 5th in a criminal investigation about the @POTUS. #Disgrace
#RESIGN

Recently turned into a Hooters and Trump's Gentleman Club. Too small for indoor golf
LOL...:)
AGE OF DRAGONS
On this day in 2018, Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen took the 5th. Trump has previously said only monsters take the 5th. Don the Con was dragged by Macron, and Ronny Jackson was exposed as an alcoholic pill-pusher.
Remember Bowling (green)
@FLOTUS looks so happy in this picture
Dude!! Thats really an unjustified anger!

#Kanye2024
If I thought the BLOTUS could fit something larger in his cake hole, I’d suggest that.  I’m pretty sure a bowling ball is the largest item he could get down his stupid lie pipe.
Truman was the bomb at bowling.
That was gold!
I’m glad someone appreciated it
Dear Mr. President,

   I will be glad to allow you to see the evidence that will be used against you and your attorney, Michael Cohen once the prosecution has been allowed to go through it. Be patient as there may be further raids before your team has access.

Thank you,
Judge
You watch too much CNN. I suppose you liked the previous president.
I watch all news. I can also tell when a car salesman is making excuses of why can't provide me a car fax.

Ummm...
On this day in 2014 this happened... and it’s still happening. @MichaelSkolnik
So cool

There is a widespread culture at VA where officials are rewarded with lavish bonuses for attaining performance goals by any means necessary, including violating veterans’ constitutional rights. Specifically, the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution prevents.

You’re awful 
president barack obama has signed an amendment to an executive order that would allow him to order the apprehension and detention of americans who merely show signs of “respiratory illness ” #WTH
That would make it 71 years old.

Pretty cool
On this day in 2018 President Trump started a love affair with Kanye West.
YES! Yeah Bowling! 
Nice.
I'd love to see a video of Obama trying to bowl. If it is anything like throwing a baseball 
I'd like to see Teump body surf at Sandy's Beach like Obama
Current & former colleagues of Navy Rear Adm. #RonnyJackson have told Senate investigators that Randy Ronny repeatedly drank on duty, has an “explosive” temper & garnered the nickname #CandyMan among WH staff because of his prolific prescription practices.

#TimesUp
On this day in 2018 America was one step closer to Impeaching and Prosecuting @realDonaldTrump
Truman White House Renovation 1948-1952.  It was only standing out of habit.  Truman's lived in Blair house, where their was a serious assassination attempt by 2 Puerto Ricans in 1950.
Dont go for the orange fury ball, it always misses by definition.
Is that bowling alley open to the public that paid for it?
No, never has been since 1947.
Who cares. #SaveAmericaLockUpCrookedDonald
I wonder which President since then was the best bowler
According to Google, Richard Nixon was.
Which challenges The Donald because he hasn’t yet figured out a way to cheat at bowling.
So?
As Truman said any politician that gets rich is a crook. Our president is doing great!
Cool story bro
Truman. The DEMOCRAT who used Atomic weapons on civilian populations. Yeah, you might wanna put this day to rest.
Cool!
No Of White House I Go Work I m Home Rental Home Don't Mind  White House United
“Trump pushes to swap Electoral College for popular vote.” GOOD! THIS PRACTICALLY GUARANTEES US THAT YOU WON’T BE IN THAT OFFICE WHEN 2020 ROLLS AROUND.

Nice. Can I play? (Remember when they showed bowling on TV?)
That creep can roll, man!

United States Air Force.
REALLY? On this day in 1986 Chernobyl happened.  No mention about this. Why?  You would NEVER have forgotten to mention National Holocaust Remembrance Day.  #SelectiveCompassion +  #SelectiveSolidarity= You are a #Hypocrite . #RemembranceDay
The victims of communist incompetence...
From an outstanding Texas newspaper editor,
By the way, the newsprint tariff on Canadian paper - brought by one hedge fund-owned mill (no other mill complained)- has boosted our paper costs by $450-$500 per month. You can imagine the impact on larger papers - shrinking the paper
Someone should post the pic of BHO and kids in this bowling alley
Imagine if you did that now, the left would go crazy

We're waiting for Trump's signature! We  send 300 000 emails goes to Polish companies with information about the lack! 1.9 trillion outstanding bonds USA

Nice
Bowling is a much healthier pastime than watching Fox "news" all day.
Mr. president, I just wanted to let you know, I am seriously considering coming to Washington and sitting outside the white house until you talk to me.
I have been a rehabilitation teacher for blind people for the past 18 years. I have had students blood splashed on me from other teachers and have been written up when I reported it for talking bad about my co-workers. There is so many other things

Scott Pruitt is the total opposite of a public servant. His favor-trading with lobbyists and lavish lifestyle at the EPA are threatening our environmental protections and tarnishing the name of the agency.  https://www.edf.org/Lo6

BREAKING NEWS from WSJ, leaked documents from Walter Reed Hospital shows @POTUS weight is 289 lbs, BP is 154/91, cholesterol is 237. Not quite the healthy person we were told. At 71, #Trump could drop dead any time. @Foxnews @DailyCaller #Resistance @Huffingtonpost #maddow @CNN

They also monitor their 'progress' via bugs, torture them, for easier access, as the victim deteriorates and falls prey to the attack, identity sales begin, its huge business & none of these r americans. KKK at the helm.
replace them with the people who stole those peoples identities.
the alqaeda terrorist network while working with police is streaking across the usa, infecting household with aids, parasites, malaria and anything they can, the cops control the doctors, they steal the peoples identities as they fight for their lives, and when they die, the cops

And on this date in 2017, @realDonaldTrump opened the original Trump Bumper-Bowling Alley in the West Wing!

There's a strike!!!
Awesome

US drops to 45th in press freedom ranking due to "media-bashing enthusiast" Trump http://hill.cm/aEjFKrO  

Do they have balls for people with very tiny, little hands? 
Lets bowl, but I'll need my six year old granddaughter along (Olive) so we can put in the gutter bumpers. It improves my game tremendously and the fun quotas.
no need go to cinema, enjoy movies with giant screen at any time

Barack Obama already has White House remodeling plans: the bowling alley is gone
Happy 71st.
Trump should stop lying down in those lanes.  Not helping with his memory.
