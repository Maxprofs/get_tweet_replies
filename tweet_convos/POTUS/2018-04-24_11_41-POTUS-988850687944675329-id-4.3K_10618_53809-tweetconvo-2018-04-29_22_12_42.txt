Until you get super mad because Macron looks better in his suits...
He is so sarcastic he has to retweet this crap
.talk about A GOOD GUY WITHOUT A GUN STOPPING A GUN NUT
Tweeting compliments and affirmations in third person. Lovely.
Quoting someone who is talking about you is *not* considered third person...
Dear #DonaldTrump, I’m wondering how long it will take you to acknowledge the #WaffleHouseShooting, 4 innocent people died. How long will it take you to acknowledge the hero,  #JamesShawJr who put his life on the line to save others. It’s been 2 days, still waiting.
GOD BLESS AMERICA 

GOD BLESS @POTUS
Unbreakable? Based on what exactly? You think he will be loyal to you or the U.S. when he can't even be loyal to his own culture, his own heritage, his own country, his own people? Boy, has he pulled the wool over your eyes! He doesn't give a damn about France's history!
You disappoint me, President Trump. If you see what he is offering as worthwhile you need to be more transparent about what "that is about" and why we should rally behind this traitor to his own country. 
After the Trump administration us real conservatives will never see the country again  sad people can’t see what’s really happening

@realDonaldTrump’s Racism:

The Definitive List

…
What history might that be, if you don't mind my asking?
Allies feel relieved America finally has a leader in the Oval Office!
Bullshit!  Hahahahaha!


History also shows that Donnie is a racist. Sooooooo, there’s that.

I thought a Medal of Honor is a military decoration?
Not the Ellis Island one.
Oh shit well damn I gotta look that up

Would be one of the few things you didn't break or bankrupt.
So it is a witch hunt!
Recognize the Armenian Genocide.
What history?
Years ago in the United States you wanted to banish French fries now you're totally in love with them
#Poll: Who is better?
We are bestest friends... EVERYONE WITH AGENDA
two words.   remember Congress cafeteria   FREEDOM FRIES !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Joshua 3:7
And the #Lord said to #Joshua, “This #day I will begin to #exalt you in the #sight of all #Israel, that they may know that, as I was with #Moses, so I will be with you.
Amen
So confirming it means you still find need to bash him?

Robert Mueller please hurry up @PressSec
Caution... Objects in Mirror are Closer than They Appear. 
Yeah, that object is about to run off the road, hit the end of a guard rail, and explode in shitty flames. Somewhere around Muellerville, I think.
.we got a ZERO in the White house and a HERO in the Waffle House
Mueller stands with Trump!
You need to pay attention kid. Quit eating tid pods and snorting condoms...

REMEMBER When
BS Donnie Promised
To IMPLEMENT Russian Sanctions
Disclose his Personal Income Taxes
Grow Balls & Back up his Rhetorical BS Under Oath?
Negative thoughts about your President of your America is emotional garbage. Throw it away and find the positive right side.
i am still waiting for that ONE thing.....
It's great to see Trump on the international stage like this. Macron reneged on the whole Paris Climate Accord thing. Hasn't even brought it up. Can't stump the Trump!
It is apparent that you have no moral compass and have utilized the fears and anxieties of your base to project policy for various moneyed interests. Your time is coming. A new generation of voters is dawning. All this will be undone. 
His base (us) have no fears or anxieties.  We know what is coming and the path which we are going.  #GreatAwakening #WWG1WGA
Amen. I love our President and the rest of the people fighting to better this country. #WWG1WGA
He hugged Macron more than Melania.
What a joke hahaha
Please!Please!Please POTUS Donald Trump, no pol correctness  no beautiful speeches  just straight up Trump deplomacy when you meet with Buhari on 4/30  Can't wait to get my MAGA hat. Only you can do this #STOPTHEKILLINGS
Freedom Fries
Only people with a mental disorder refers to themself by their name.
Was this just stated to draw attention from that, that Mrs. Macron states that Melanie is trapped inside the whitehouse...
I seem to remember petty-ass Republicans in Congress renaming French Fries, Freedom Fries. It's been an even steeper decline of the GOP since then. Now they defy rule of law, hide traitorous dealings w/ Russia and turned America into a kakistocracy.
“President Trump Calls the U.S.-France Relationship ‘Unbreakable.’ History Shows He’s Right.” http://45.wh.gov/PxDvqT 
It’s about time French people wake up too.
They did long ago. The US is the one that needs to wake up.
U should have been a comedian..oh that's right u have a SAG CARD FOR ACTORS!!
Trump's says his marriage with the First Lady, @FLOTUS, is unbearable, but look who he screwed during that relationship. I wouldn't trust him.
No one gives a damn if you trust him or not. Question is..Do you trust yourself??

Ayuda al pueblo de Nicaragua te necesitamos apollanos hermano q aigan  elecciones justas
Mr.President is in charge of how he feels and today he is choosing happiness.Well Done President.


Trump is going to try and get us involved in a war with North Korea and Iran before any more people from his campaign get arrested.
Great
Candy man
@PressSec Except when the president of France  contradicts everything #Spanky45  stands for.  Hahahaha @SarahSanders you my dear are a lying SOS.  Is this you before H&M

Yup right up until you claimed to pick dandruff off his jacket and announced it to the world. You are the worse person imaginable, no wonder Mel detests you. Go have that stroke so Dr Candy can tend to you
As a Brit, I feel left out.
Honestly, same

I made it Mr. Trump, bringing back to this alliance France.
As a French, event though I don't like my president, I was happy to see how Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron managed to show the world that the friendship between france and the us is, indeed, unbreakable !
Yeck
Can you confirm if is true

Hey we are strong with France but remember your faith, its Jewish, muslims are not what America stands for.
Unlike past ADM President TRUMP is strengthening our relations with our fellow countries worldwide. 
Thank you sir! 
MAGA

Remember when u banned French Fries  from Capitol Hill, when France  said no to the Anti-Saddam Coalition? At that Time nobody talked about an unbreakable Relationship
LIAR!
Ive never seen two straight men touch each other so much before
It’s called the ‘You Three’ movement!    Let’s see the ‘Likes’ to support this movement!  Don’t be bias!


Hell yeah!   Freedom fries baby!!!   Hahaha
Trump is not trustworthy. Period !  Our countries will always be allies, but Trump will put a knife in anyone's back. Trump is on his way out of our white house. He's a complete embarrassment and has been enabled by our Republican Congress to undermine our Constitution.
Nuts O!
So apparently real news; White House press releases, faux news, and tweets. Fake news; everyone and everything else without something nice to say about the trumpeter.
Fortunately it is unbreakable - not even YOU can screw it up
You will be impeached.
Lafayette we Are here
Your son will remember you as the worst president ever
If you keep being such a biggot, bigmouth it will break very soon.
It's not because of him. It's because of hard working  passed presidents and outstanding cabinet. You just don't have it. Impeachment.
Uh, remember "freedom fries"? Another classy republican maneuver!

Thanks for loving our country! The last person tried to make us ashamed of being Americans!
You freak!! Stop talking in the 3rd person!
So says Donald J. Trump about what President Trump said?
The States broke it in 1939. or forgot it, or ignored it, whichever it was you left France occupied for 3 years and did nothing
Just for test
France needs to get out of the business of facilitating its own invasion

              Validate your 2nd Amendment Rights.....     Carry !
Freedom Fries?
The Americans have more interest with same faith values.
What else has Iranians have to offer, let me see terrorism, I would stand with Israel.
Oil is a commodity,  we can survive without it, history has proved it possible.
The American people fought hard for freedom Iranian rule is not freedom.
-
Not true trump you will find someway to break up the US-France Relationship
Be your decision for the climate a part of the unbreakable......... I am confident you'll keep it that way, President.

#basta
Whis history is that? The one I am reading here, is saying that the 45th was an impostor and was thrown in Jail...
Be nice. You would have that kind of relationship with everyone else the same. Jeez.
Too bad he doesn’t have the same relationship with the American people.
Macron is a perv like Anthony Weiner just the opposite way
He is the Traitor& Chief. We will have him charged and incarcerate for treason, collusion, terrorism and other felonies that he's committed.
It better be... France helped US when revolutionary war, back in 1700's

If anyone can duck it up you certainly can sir.
America is HOME in Europe and Europe is HOME in America.We share the same goal.This is the healthiest friendship between two worldwide powers (see more about NATO)Mr. President seems to be always more relaxed and confident when he is here and it's a thing hard to immitate or hide
Look what I can do
Is @realDonaldTrump a traitor? Soft on Russia, spent none of the $120M allocated to stop Russia meddling in ongoing elections. Chooses Tillerson over Romney then fires him because Putin ordered it. #putinspuppet  https://theintercept.com/2018/02/16/trump-russia-election-hacking-investigation/ … April 24 13:41:09
I don’t know about that I recall that France wouldn’t let the US enter their air space when Iraq invaded Kuwait and again when we respondedto the September 11 attacks. The response by the French government was a clear no
Thank you Presidents Trump and Marcon for strengthening this great relationship.
Those French, great allies! What a fighting force! The only French most soldiers have learned is "I surrender!"


Just like Japan , Hillary forgets a lesson in America understanding of freedom and law an order
I am Iranian So I Say (Down With America)
You’re quoting yourself?
#TrumpWillScrewFranceSomehow
...
Incredible!  God Bless you, Mr. President.

This was  a waste of our tax money dog and pony show .We are not a dictatorship we do not do this  kind of crap.   The Frenchie is so smart he played you like a fiddle.Him & his wife will be laughing on plane all the way home.
We are so proud of you!!!!
You are the best POTUS. Everyone is so jealous because you have it all. No one can touch what you have. No one works harder than you and your family. Pls don’t stop!!!
Felicidades por ser Presidente de este Gran Pais Bendiciones

Wow. That is disturbing. Certainly not "beautiful poetry"  as she put it. I can see why people are concerned.
Potus you really need to do something about the liberal bias on Facebook. 
My account was suspended again for no reason. 
My account is use for financial lively hood ..
Too.Many.Quote.Quotes.
I just about got off watching you and your boy toy Macron today. Are you sure you are straight?  Bi right? Come on, put on that rainbow tie you have hiding in the back of your closet.
The left is bashing homosexuality??? Oh my true colors!
Let’s hope so as all you have done so far is take America down as a world leader. BTW- Talking about yourself in the 3rd person only reflects your emotional separation from reality.
You actually wrote that?  Telling us that you said you are right?  SMFH.
Margaret likes your comment! Oops I mean I do!
Are you gay?  Sure seems like it.
No He's  No Right I Really Respect Mr President Donald Trump God Bless you American Availability

#plead5th only the #mobs does it. Huh
To a certain degree, the establishment of America was for the sake of France.
Narcissistic Trump tweeting about him self, again...
You are like a glass when you put down others & break christ only knows.




sounds hot.
Donald Trump it will be broken once you drop your pants in front of the wife of the French President!
Even Republican congressional leaders couldn't break it when they ordered french fries referred to as "freedom fries" because France didn't support our invasion of Iraq. Turns out, the French were right.
Obama would have apologized for the Louisiana Purchase. #MAGA

Except when republicans start renaming French fries freedom fries because France didn’t support us bombing a random country...
