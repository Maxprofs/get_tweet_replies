Colossians 3:16
Let the #word of #Christ #dwell in you richly in all #wisdom, #teaching and admonishing one another in #psalms and #hymns and #spiritual #songs, singing with #grace in your #hearts to the #Lord.
Romans 13:5-7
Therefore you must be #subject, not only because of #wrath but also for #conscience’ #sake. For because of this you also pay #taxes, for they are #God’s #ministers attending continually to this very #thing. #Render therefore to all their due: #taxes [1/2]
to whom #taxes are due, #customs to whom #customs, #fear to whom #fear, #honor to whom #honor. [2/2]

Obama 1st State Dinner. One Republican Senator, his fellow Indiana Senator, Luger. One Republican Governor, Bobby Jindal, because the guest of honor was the Indian Prime Minister.

Nobody from Fox or any other conservative-leaning news media.
That's because they didn't attend, they were still invited.  Nice try snowflake.
Wrong - they were not invited....
Exactly.

Still very offensive.
Christian Trump supporter...

#LMFAO
The writer/contributor of this is a desperate fool has been. no body cares!!! He's our president and we support him 150% !!!
Like the inauguration, the State Dinner is smaller than Obama's.
Well isn't that nice since State Dinners are payed for by the Tax Payer
Yep, just like all of Obama's multi million dollar vacations and Michelle's designer dresses.

Trump knows he WILL make an ass of himself so he doesn't want any witnesses that he doesn't think are "loyal" to him. 

Trump shuns Democrats and media at first state dinner - POLITICO
Any words from the White House for the unarmed African-American hero who disarmed a mass shooter? We will not be distracted. Americans are needlessly dying. We need sensible gun laws NOW.
Of course not. The hero is black and the gun man a white supremacist.
What a spectacular job FOTUS does!  It was beaitiful!
Let's hope he doesn't embarrass us too much
The only embarrassing thing for the USA are the haters openly disrespecting our president
If you’d been around the world just a little bit, you would know that the man is a global laughing stock and the biggest disgrace to the USA since Agent Orange. Well .... maybe he IS Agent Orange actually?
No Democrats or media invited?!? That's authoritarian not presidential. Sad.
Why would you want to invite those people who are constantly badmouthing you, and making false statements about you?
 Flotus beautiful state dinner 

Awesome, so looking forward to it. America  has the best President ever!
Obama-Obama-Obama is that who your talking about. I know he was a honest MAN something that ASSHOLE in office knows nothing about
Grow up, get some followers and stop lying to yourself!
This isn't the kind of thing you promote. Do you want a gold star? The White House is supposed to be able to do diplomacy and things like State Dinners. Most presidents have already done theirs by now. Obama's first: 11/24/09 (sworn in 1/20/09).
He had many of them, because that is the one dinner that the Tax payer pays for, most ppl think all meals and party's are on us they aren't

Last night, a white gunman killed four innocent, unarmed people of color with an assault rifle in a Tennessee Waffle House.…

Dear '@POTUS, PLEASE reach out to '@theresa_may to have #AlfieEvans released 2 his parents. He is an Italian citizen, currently in a #UK hospital, '@AlderHey; they took him off of oxygen, etc...that he desperately needs to live!!! They are depriving him of life!

How do you violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause if Macron stays at the White House? Does he just give you cash in a bag, or do you bill him for meals from a trump Org restaurant, or take him golfing at a trump Org course?

We know you’re only in it for the money, you greedy POS!
James Shaw Jr. protected everyone At the Waffle House. Donald Trump refuses to acknowledge his heroism because he is black.
France and the EU are no longer our allies. I will feel safer once Macron goes back to his terrorist ridden craphole country and even safer if he takes that statue of liberty for ILLEGALS only back with him. Its overstayed its welcome.
Does it outline what a coward 45 is? Too afraid to invite any Dems, the media...worst president ever!
kind of looks like an outside look to me
This not not a state visit like all previous state visits. I can't wait to read all about it in the papers. Oh, I forgot, the free press is not invited.
If you want the Russia fiasco to END
 all you have to do is focus on the real crime @BarackObama is laughing at you because you are focused on the wrong thing
#AwanBrothers HAVE ALL OF @HillaryClinton #Emails
@TheJusticeDept @JaySekulow
Let's have an inside look on Trump's taxes shall we?
The new GOP line on Trump may be its best yet: yes, he's an internatonal money launderer whose dirty money has for decades come from Russia; yes, that felonious conspiracy drives his Russia policy as POTUS; but we're not sure you can investigate that, even if DOJ said you could.
Taxes will show us yes or no.  Yet he resists clearing himself.  Guilt?
Makes one wonder why he never released his taxes like everyone else.
TOO MANY RUBLES.
Because if you follow the money we are going to find something he doesn’t want us to find.
....without the Democrats because he believes in bipartisanship.
Or maybe because he want s a pleasant evening
Obama invited republicans many times for these and had a pleasant evening, even though they hated him. Your comment essentially admits that trump can’t handle criticism.
There was a van attack yesterday in Toronto. A mass shooting near Nashville Sunday. Any comment?
Everything about Trump is small!!! 
SC Mueller & NYAG Schneiderman r working hard. They're getting close. Obstruction, RICO, money laundering, racketeering, conspiracy. Indictments dropping soon! Who's next Donnie? U R! Resign now! #moron #dotard #Muellertrainrolling #theresistence #indivisible #voteblue #BlueWave
ROTFLMAO you keep on dreaming, on May 8th your going to wake up its going to be a nightmare
Let’s see how he f***s this up!
Any plans for a press conference by Donald? He has not had one of those in 431 days. Is Donald afraid to take questions from reporters?
While we're on the subject of EXCESSIVE spending of tax payers money. When will you be firing Jarad & Ivanka & Pruitt? And what's with this nonsense of the Prez? Week long golfing on our DIME too! Also separate traveling for FLOTUS & prez it has to stop!
also heard the prez is planning a playboy bunny invite to WH for a party??? Is that true??? If so ya damn well better shut that shit down. Hasn't 45 made a mess of our great WH already?? What about that impeachment? When will ya be doing this???Let them all go to Marlago!
Why didn't he put on his show at Marlago? could of saved a trip. He was there all week long last week. Why was it okay for Japan but now we have to welcome France to the WH what is the difference??He run out of money while playing all week long at golf?? Don't France love golf 2?
Need to also tell the mrs @FLOTUS  she has to travel with her hubby no extra taxpayers should have to pay for two trips on our dime. Suck it up you married the idiot so deal with it! Not to mention more secret service staff is needing!
Help honor WWI by putting the memorial next to the WWII memorial. It is currently going in front of a zamboni door in the bottom of Pershing Park. No Kidding. Sad. Frank Buckles fought for the mall at age 108. How about you? #dishonor #veterans #nationalmall #GreatWar #WWI

#colluderinchief nice of you to drop Russian sanctions. Heard they called to thank you!
is it a state visit if you exclude half the people?

He’ll embarrass us. Per usual.

Thank you for your hard work Mrs Trump. You are very much appreciated. God bless. 

Looks just GREAT, Mr President  !!
Interesting bit of history.  :)
He will highlight his legacy....

Shouldn't the quote under this picture read "near the White House" not "at the White House".  Last time I checked the EOB wasn't on the White House grounds.

I started today with this statement and I'll end with it:

Trump is a #royalbaby.
Is that cupcake @EmmanuelMacron coming for tea  leaving the perishing people of France behind for a couple of days ? It should have been @MLP_officiel visiting  not that €urophyle wet newspaper 
An embarrassment to America and Americans.

WHERE ARE THE CONDOLENCES FOR THE TORONTO VICTIMS? FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE WAFFLE HOUSE SHOOTING? 
Macron already found the time...

Who cares?

Chlorpyrifos hurts the brain and lowers IQ, especially in kids, who also experience tremors due to the chemical. It's been linked to everything from cancer to Parkinson's.
