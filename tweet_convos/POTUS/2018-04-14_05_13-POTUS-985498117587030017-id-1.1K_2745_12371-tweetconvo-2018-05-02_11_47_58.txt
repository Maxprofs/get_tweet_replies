Friends went to Cuba. Poor country, nothing there.  Obama administration loved to support this dictatorship! Freedom is a God given right. #EndSocialism #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
I've been to Cuba twice.  Lovely people, beautiful beaches, excellent healthcare, etc.  They have plenty to offer.
excellent healthcare ... plenty to offer." Add good food, service and decent shops (aka 'diplo-tiendas'). ONE CAVEAT: as long as you pay in $$ or "convertible pesos" (remember the CUC vs CUP). Ask any body how many of those they make a month... 
A real joke for locals...
excellent heathcare? Filthy hospitals, no access to modern  tools or medication.Would you like to have a biopsy performed with a dull instrument from 1955? Good propaganda BS
I guess that's why the last president of Venezuela went to Cuba for cancer treatment.  It's another good reason for lifting the embargo.
Sounds like you really like Cuba.  Why don't you just move there and take your Socialist Propaganda with you. #DemocratsHateAmerica #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #SocialismKills #BuildTheWallNow #immigrationreform
Oh look, a bot.
That's the only reply a Socialist Dem ever has. They can't handle the fact that true Americans don't believe in Dictatorships! Truly, you should take your Propaganda and sail back to Cuba!  #SocialismKills #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
You all are so quick to be critical and hateful to our VP, lets see if you can show there is more in your head then hate and criticism. Give a 5 point presentation of what we should do about Cuba.
Lift the embargo, start trading, stop demonizing the people of Cuba, stop being afraid of socialism and get rid of #45.
start trading.." btw, Cuba does plenty of business with EU. Spain's hotel chains are an example. Reason: cheap labor. Hotels pay a fixed fee per worker to Castro. Unlike other Caribbean spots, in Cuba there are no strikes, wage negotiations, absenteeism etc. just obedient people
Once again, I've been to Cuba and actually talked to Cubans.  You?
You?" Low and behold.. you have actually talked to Cubans ?? WOW...
I believe I have been to Cuba more times than you just visiting and once doing a project there (a few months). Risky to have the notion that you are "above the rest" all the time. Cheers.
Good for you, if you've actually been and haven't met people that would dearly love to see the embargo lifted then I guess it's you that's been dealing with the elites.
Thank you. It’s been 57 yrs ago at age two when I left Cuba. Raised here. I would one day like to see where I was born, but never ever go unless that communist country is free.
I'm Canadian and I've been a couple of times.  If they really wanted to help the Cuban people they would lift the embargo.
If you'd ever visited Cuba you would see how the embargo is hurting the Cuban people.  This is not about politics, it's about humanity.
Castro is dead, I thought you Russians knew that.
Before being with cuban's, be with your self. Stop killings everywhere in the world. Stop wars , attacks in Syria, yemen. Leave people live in peace. Stop manipulations! Solve the human right in the countries you are supporting as Egypt or SAK, Then talk about human rights

More untruths !

LIAR!
You want to help them? Really? So start lifting your embargo, let them spend their money in schools, hospitals, research and technology in stead of missiles and weapons to be sure they are safe from you. Stop lying to people please. Promote peace in stead of war & destruction
সুন্দর
Where’s your wife?  Did she know you were touching that woman’s hand?
Oh, you're just mad because President Trump wants to stop sex changes in the military.
Nope.
Mad because President Trump is having thousands of pedophiles rounded up.
Ha!
Indifferent to that huh. Then you must be angry because Trump kicked the Muslim Brotherhood out of the White House and now they're having Bible studies in the West Wing.
That is just silly.
Hey Mike, how bout standing for free and fair elections for the American people?  Do you stand with them?
Omg does Mother know u shook a females hand?!?
You dont stand for the Cuban people. Open the Embassy in Havana if you really want to help. We Cubans waiting to be reunited with oue families will always be thankful/gratefull
Seems like you enjoy lying to people
Is about time!
Not  buying that line Pence .. as long as I can remember, Cuba has been an enemy .. what has changed that these days?
Read with comprehension

Love our VP Trump.
When are we going to have the same in this country?  Let Mueller finish!
So, did Mrs. Bush for Kendrick Lamar.
Please if you're considering country for their freedom and restoration what about Biafrans are they not worthy of freedom,? please you people should look into it we plead with you guys.
Dear Mr. Vice President, it seems you don't know your ass from your elbow and you seem ineffective in  actually helping most of American people, including the poor souls you count as your base. What have you done for the Cuban people?
Well Puerto Rico is part of democracy how’s it working out for them? #screwupence

JA JUŻ PODPISAŁEM A TY? 
You & your buddy, DUMP, are so full of Donkey Doo! Another FAKE Christian..

Just like China
You’re for free and fair  elections in Cuba yet you do nothing when Russia Putin attacks are elections here
america first would mean letting our farmers sell beef, rice, beans, etc. to collapse the ramon’s communist market from within. #FailedEmbargo #BillionDollarSales
You probably don’t know that cuban can go to jails if then eat beef
i do. the gov’t owns all the cows but they turn their backs to all the black market beef. esp those in the restaurants.
Thank you Vice President Mike Pence for recognizing the struggle the Cuban people have suffered for almost 60 years. We thank President Trump for listening to the Cuban community because we personally know what a lot of us been thru.
60 years of Republican BS..and you eat it up..and now in cahoots with Russia just like Fidel! How about we restore free and fair elections in US before we do the same in Cuba.Pence and Trump are traitors.
I was born in Cuba... you're an uneducated fool. I know what I'm talking about, my family and I lived it. What do you know socialist?
I feel relieved that finally the DOS seems to realize that Cuba and Venezuela situations are linked and should be properly addressed altogether! In Venezuela the Cuban G2 is ruling the country while in Cuba the regime is violating civil and Human Rights systematically.
Lyin David Dennison!
Congratulations VP Pence as You and President Trump are "The Best One Two Combination to Ever Be in the White House and May The Good LORD of Heaven Bless You Both, Always", Sir !!!  Sincerely; Mr. Frank M. of Ontario, Canada
If you stand with the Cuban people then you should STAND WITH ALL CUBANS. INCLUDING THE ONES WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR DECADES FROM U.S. TRADE SANCTIONS.
Cuba is a Communist Country . Correct ?
Free Clint Lorance!!!!! Ridiculous charges brought against a serviceman who did what he felt he must to save his men!!!
You want free cuba of free health care and free education? Rigth!
PUT ZUCKERBERG in "THE" jail.
Oh shut up you puppet , your so insignificant and invalid
Bs

You are promising free and fair elections for the Cuban people?!! how ironic...since the American people didn't have them!
As a Cuban American that am I I gave thank God for President TRUMP!!!
Can you just give us a heads up when f*ckboy @realDonaldTrump decides to declare #WW3 .. Thanks @VP
Mike Pence: Then I immediately deported her.
Liar
Did you tell her what a great job you did with Puerto Rico? You don’t have to.
all hail to freedom... all hail to love... all hail to Yeshua... we are so very blessed... aint life a blast....
Cuba should pledge allegiance to the USA.Become another Democratic Territory  of US
Um and Trump congratulated putin on his fake election.  Your hypocrisy is astounding
Theres always dirty behind spanky and gang..just thinking.....m
Is that Mother, behind the flag? Are you aware that @POTUS tweeted hateful things about Obama being “too nice” to Cuba? This Crime Party is all over the place. Mr. Pence, be assured, we are aware you are as criminally corrupt as your boss. You’ll be leaving too...
So now Americans don't have the freedom to travel to Cuba to do trade and business?  The Revolution was decades ago. America trades with VIETNAM. They are Communists, Chinese are too.
CAN WE GET ALL THIS HERE IN AMERICA FIRST.
Thanks for the Great job you are doing Mister Vice President! Pence 2024!!

Awesome!

The woman who had @POTUS lower his trousers for a spanking has arrived in court. 
More news as I have it... 
यह VIP लोगों की व्यवस्था होती है
Yes we are with the Cuban people!
Mr. Vice President it is time to bring Assata Shakur, AKA Joanne Chesimard, to justice for the murder of NJSP Trooper Werner Foerster. Justice has been delayed long enough.
Hope your wife was there otherwise you can’t be trusted.
Can't believe pence is shaking a woman's hand. Where's his wife? I also wonder if he mentioned that people of color aren't welcome as immigrants to US. That this admin's racist.
انا برأيي انت تدعو العالم وترفعو ايدكم عنه وسوف يعم السلام بدونكم
Really? Human rights & fair elections? Hypocrite.
You are puting your eyes in the wrong people. We are happy in Cuba, we don´t need any freedom, we already are freedom.

It seems to me or not she provokes naked knees
How about opening the US EMBASSY In Havana and allowing families to reunite. That seems like a basic thing that should not involve politics or government. @EmbaCubaEEUU @EmbaCubaUS @VP @realDonaldTrump
How about Cuba turns on WiFi so their own people can arrange rides instead of standing on the side of the roads for hours and hours to go simply 40 miles.  How about Cuba not coming in and closing a business because it’s too successful too soon. #Basicthings
Not buying that line Pence .. as long as I can remember, Cuba has been an enemy .. what these days has made that fact any different?
Chin d merddd!
So we do this from a distance with no diplomacy?We condemn rather than demonstrate democracy.Doubtful with you as leader,any good can be seen in democracy by Cuban people.I can only imagine what they think of you as 70%of America  thinks you an imbecile.
You're not even for those things here.
BullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshit#MORON
What about Saudi Arabia? What about Russia?
Do you feel the same way about helping #PuertoRico or how about #Syrians #hypocrite
But said Fuck You to our own People in Puerto Rico... UNFIT FOR OFFICE... You need to be impeached, swishy @VP MikePence  and his little dog too  
What about the embargo? You are inhuman. ABOLISH THE EMBARGO FOREVER YOU POSSER.
You demonize Communist Cuba, yet cozy up to Communist China and Vietnam. What’s the difference? Oh yeah, cheap computer products and cheap labor. Cuba? Just another Spanish-speaking country you can’t stand.
What a joke, just another visual production by the TRUMP media, Hope you like the Kool aid coursing through your greedy veins Mike,
Awesome to know you will help.
Follow us @TrueStoryYOUTUB
so Karen must've been in the room
By “human right” you mean for men, right? This administration disrespects women on ever level.
Then USA need to solve Mexican question with his gang:)
That’s great but what about the American island of Puerto Rico? Fema loaned PR momey? Why is PR left in the dark and being discriminated against .
You discriminated because you never sent any help in Puerto Rico. Just wait for the government which use our children money.
During his  network TV interview, former FBI Chief " Slippery" James Comey likened his ex-boss Donald "Horse Patootie" Trump to a mob boss.

 However, rather than the Godfather, Don Corleone, he should go down in history as the Oddfather, Don Fullabaloney.
Pence trying to look presidential as he preps for taking over in the White House.
But yet all the progress to that made by the last great president of the USA Obama Putin’s puppet destroyed in a week of stealing office

Have you ever been to Cuba. If you lift the embargo everything would be fine, but belligerent USA just want to cause trouble. Maybe it is big business that don’t want their rum and cigar monopoly upset.
if you are on their side - they are in trouble.

Russia, Cuba to deliver old samples of air defense S-125, s-200, cube, square. And democratic missiles will be broken by obsolete air defense systems of the USSR. Disclosed combat capability of the US army, betrayal of the US military.
They know how you really feel. You’ve made it pretty clear.  It is so shameful and embarrassing the way you talk about people.
Back up those words with actions.
You and trump are just no good liars
Кирдык вам амеры.Бландинчик,ты скажи,в чем сила? Пиздец тебе,сучара.Медный таз вам янкам.ФБР в жопу,ебать буду,кончалыги.
Cuba is better off now then when the mob ran it. Just like here the rich treated the populace like slaves, Castro asked the United States for help but mob was tied to Washington D.C.politicians.
So now the "Cuban people" have a worthless dog as a friend...how nice for them.

Mr President can the CIA look for the generator of this meme and make sure they never get American Visa
HILARIOUS
I HATE YOU
Good thinking!
you don't want us to have free and fair elections. what a joke.
How many Russian dissidents have you met with? Are you and Trump fighting for free and fair elections in Russia? Oh, of course you're not.
Do not believe them,they do not respect the sovereignty of other countries, they talk about freedom and democracy  while they intervene in other countries, killing people& changing it's rulers. They are the masters of lies and undisputed.
if the US invaded 23 missiles directly into a plant and research project and the production of chemical weapons in the suburbs of Damascus, WHERE IS CONTAMINATION ???? So there was nothing there, and they were lying ..
TRUMP warned Putin days ahead.
@POTUS Nice  Job maga 
You're holding hands with a lovely young woman. I sure hope Mother was in the room.
Maybe try that first on the USA!
Hit the chemist and let the butcher 
Lol. In other words - we are with the people - but that’s about it. Until you guys overthrow the island. Look at Puerto Rico. You left them for forgotten

Solo 2 cosas tumban tiranías comunistas por un pueblo. Multitud en calle enfrentándose con fuerza, furia y rebeldía (ojo no con debilidad) y/o con armas. Esto también puede desencadenar ayuda externa. Libertad #Cuba #Venezuela. Es algo similar a "estás conmigo o estás contra mi". …

Better check with Big Don before you speak

Disown tyranny & succession, yes. Now, what platform to "decide", the tyranny’s one? It failed already with @oswaldopaya, & brought Irrevocable Socialism #Cuba. #Venezuela is another eg.

The worst president in history. History books will describe you clearly: Stormi Daniels, Prostitutes urinating, Racist, Greedy, Self-centered, CheAted your wife and country, Mueller Investigations, Comey, Tax fraud, Narcissistic behavior, Thief, and it goesON
But, Cubans should stay on Cuba and not come to the US, nor should we trade w/ them, nor travel there in any numbers. Right?
Why would you suggest all that? The U.S trades with other communist countries, Cubans can get travel visa like anyone else. And why would you suggest Americans shouldn't travel there? 
I didn't say Americans shouldn't travel to Cuba! Our government has cut back on it's citizens being allowed to go there, just after Obama reduced sanctions. I'd love to come and see the buildings and old cars and meet people. It wasn't my idea!
Actually the rules for travel are mostly the same.

Dump tightened U.S. embargo cause he owed political debt to conservative Cuban Americans who supported him; the Bay of Pigs vets org endorsed Dump. In return, he promised to reverse Obama’s policy. Invocation of human rights is more an excuse thn the reason 4 Dumps policy chnge.
The biggest busness in USA is Holocaust Business.All the world have to pay for Jew because of USA.
End the Cuban Embargo!  Pence/Trump lie!  Obama opened the door, they are closing it.
Why USA is dependent of Israel means they will lose their friends.
