In the face of tragedy, we pull together, support each other, and thank the extraordinary first responders who keep us safe. #TorontoStrong 
The tragedy happened yesterday, fool. If you weren't golfing you would have sent this tweet then.
You have no idea what he was doing yesterday.
Symptoms

1. Raised red area, usually around the nostrils and lips, which tingles and feels itchy. Tiny blisters then form on the spot.

2. Weeping blisters, which then crust over.....

Trump Just Threw His Own VA Secretary Nominee Under The Bus https://www.politicususa.com/2018/04/24/trump-just-threw-his-own-va-secretary-nominee-under-the-bus.html … via @politicususa
I didn’t vote for Trump because he was a morally perfect person. I voted for him because he has the BALLS to do what is RIGHT for this country!

I believe God has placed this imperfect man in the perfect position to save us from ourselves. May the Lord continue to bless the USA.

@SashaLakic
Don’t hide from terror face it head in
WE need Canada to stand with US. Dump Trump!
Thoughts and prayers ain't shit.
vans are used for transportation and ar 15s for killing only

My thoughts and prayers are with all involved in this tragic incident and with the people of Toronto.
What about our own recent #racistdomesticterrorism ? #AmericaFirst???
People with hay fever or cystic fibrosis are also more likely to develop this problem....
And the AMERICAN Waffle House shooting? Weren’t you the America first guy?
Ohhhh but we don't want thoughts and prayers from a criminal like you, donald !

#TorontoAttacks
Hey, .@POTUS, white lady in #Utah here, wondering WHEN IN THE HELL you're going to comment on mass-murder of 4 people in Nashville 2 days ago

You posted 20+ tweets about "witch hunts" (& every other thing) this weekend--BUT NOT 1 WORD ABOUT THE MURDER OF 4/OTHERS INJURED
Where are your, "thoughts and prayers" for the young people shot and killed at Waffle House?  Or your thank you to the young man who stopped the shooter?  You're a POS.
#BanRentalVans
Your racism is so blatant that no one can ignore it anymore. Four people were killed in Nashville house by a white supremacist nutcase and you say nothing.  #TrumpIsAWhiteSupremacy
If you really stand with Canada (and not Russia) you would have offered thoughts and prayers  YESTERDAY....when it happened.
But what about the Waffle House shooting?!? (And the hero who stopped it!!??)
Canada first?
well it is for Canadians
I completely agree with the statement (and it should be made) but for a guy whose slogan is “America first...”
well, we are neighbours
Again I have nothing against the actual statement and completely agree with it. The point I am making is he hasn’t commented about this shooting at all (and it even happened a while before the Canadian event).
Yes.  He has.
Show me the tweet
#JamesShawJr #HERO
Also, a he started a Go Fund Me for the victims families. What a guy. Also, someone started a Go Fund Me for him! So if anyone would like to buy him a drink or send flowers, do that instead!
You know that there was a Waffle House mass shooting in your backyard, right? I see that you're conspicuously quiet about that,  tho.
what about the hero who saved many in the Waffle House shooting - oh yea, he's Black and the shooter is white -  racist Trump doesn't care about that.
Who stands with us?
A white domestic terrorist shot up a Waffle House with an AR-15 and killed 4 people. He was stopped by an unarmed black man who, so far, has raised over $40,000 in donations for the victims. Not a peep from you.
True that!
Curious there @realDonaldTrump where's your tweet to the four victims killed here in America while have an early breakfast...do you stand with them, their families, the community? #WafflehouseStrong
PLS 4 ONCE IN UR LIFE PRESIDENT HUMPTY DUMPTY DELETE UR TWEET WE WANT NOTHING FROM U. IT TOOK U OVER 24HRS 2 MENTION US, IT'S OK WE NO U HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS 2 DO, U HAVE 2 LIE & MAKE SURE U DON'T GO 2 JAIL. UR GOING 2 B LOVED BY THE MEN IN JAIL. WE R BETTER OFF WITHOUT U.

A GoFundMe to raise money to help pay for the college of the Waffle House Hero’s daughter. A real hero. He deserves this. Thanks for making it @yashar https://www.gofundme.com/help-the-waffle-house-hero …
Ronny Jackson goes under the bus.  thump, thump.

next up?
thx god emperor trump
Trudeau is a pawn of Soros et al
Thank you President Trump for your amazing leadership!
He’s not gonna let you touch it.
This would be a good clap back for Joey Mann and Jacob Wohl 
I hit them with it all the time. They’re the worst.
Thank you for being a caring, compassionate President! Trump 2020!!
oh  Lord bless the weak minded...
Amen. I wonder why they are being so tight lipped about victims and the man who did it. It all seemed to fade fast from the news.
Have the liberals started talking about banning vans and all automatic vehicles yet?
The poor people of Toronto, which is a beautiful city, should not have had to go through such a horrible tragedy. I really hope they actually released the details of the story as they really seem to be burying it at the moment. That’s probably at Trudeau’s request.
It’s all over Canadian News you moron. Ours News outlets don’t make up lies or falsehoods to sway public opinion like @FoxNews and @realDonaldTrump do.
Because they don’t have the facts! When they do know something, they share it. Speculation is self-serving stupidity!
Still silent on the Waffle House homeland terrorist, are you?
“Thoughts and prayers” just sounds wrong coming out of your mouth sunshine.

Before Trump: We had racist
Before Trump: Indigenous people lived in America
Before Trump: We had bigots
Before Trump: We had White Supremacist
Before Trump: We had slavery, Jim Crow, Tea Party, Birtherism
Before Trump: The KKK wore white hoods
After Trump: The hoods came off
Canada would be stronger if it had a real leader instead of Justine prancing around bending over for the radical musilms.
With Trudeau at the helm, Canada truly needs our prayers.
Were you ever planning on giving credit to the hero who wrestled the gun away from the Waffle House shooter or no because he’s not white?
And still no mention of those black victims by the white killer here in our own country (Nashville)?
Took Obama 6 days, oh wait he NEVER thanked this hero who literally took bullets to prevent a shooter from killing more people... Feel stupid yet?    Obama slow to honor the man who rushed the killer in Oregon.
Pretty much like your president hasn't said a word about the black college grad who disarmed and shooter in Houston Texas...in as many days but we all know you're lying. In fact post what you said here and I bet I can post the truth to prove you lied about Obama.never missed one
Your President
Now I'm waiting...oh wait..for what??
Guess what he never did.  Notice that it said “to call”.  Show me where it said he did.
Ho hum sooo gotta post where he did call? Lol! Wow he always called, he also went there I remember seeing the report on MSNBC or wait..maybe that was fake news as well as the video of him touring and speaking at the campus...he did that but at least could have fakexa call too huh
It's great to support Canada after the killings but what about the 4 Americans who were slaughtered in a TN Waffle House?  What about the brave amazing heroic American James Shaw Jr who not only saved lives but started a gofundme for the victims!
James Shaw Jr. a real American Hero. He makes you proud to be a GOD fearing, American loving Patriot. Keep him and his family in your prayers. He deserves a blessing that only GOD can supply. In Christ Jesus name I lift up my prayer for them now. Amen
YES!  100% agree :)
BEST PRESIDENT EVER


Two things: 

Did you see how well trained the officers were that arrested the suspect alive?

#JamesShawJr, who stopped the mass shooting at #WaffleHouse in Tennessee has raised over $100K for the victims.

Talk about a guy that doesn’t know what he’s doing or talking about... every tragedy he says the same thing... but never fixes anything...unbelievable that he runs an entire country and is allowed to
Trudeau has ruined Canada
Said the American whose idea of a good country is the US
USA is the Best! I’m
A proud American with an excellent President. I’m safer in the US then Canada or Europe will ever be! Haha

Canada prime
Hope Trudeau wakes up to the threat he can’t see in his country...before it is too late!
You should teach Trudeau how to behave!
Still nothing from you about the Nashville attack?
Should we ban vans??
Smells like another intl agencies collusion false flag attack against citizens
You forgot to mention the Waffle House Massacre in our own country. 4 dead!
Trudeau, the Empirer, with no clothes.
Yes, they do. But many-I would like to say all Canadians but...- are appalled and disgusted by you and @GOP.  Sweet talk doesn't fool us. You may think we are foolish, that's just fine. Works for me. #ResistanceIsEverywhere.
trump we dont want your prayers
I hate to break it to you Sir, but our PM is the reason this terrorist attack happened, in the first place.
I am very disappointed  in CNN and Trump. Canada is supposed to America's  closest  alli and to virtually  mention this act of Terror  in a 1 liner is not good enough. With CNN being a regular on Canadian  tv,  very poor response!!. Personally  I will remove CNN .
How nice that you took time to tweet about an act of terror in Canada yet you have yet to mention the act of terror in Tennessee. Many shot with four deaths until an unarmed courageous man tackled the shooter. There is no excuse for your silence about this...
Have any reporters asked him why he hasn’t mentioned it??
I haven't heard any ask him. @PressSec mentioned it yesterday on behalf of Trump but he hasn't spoken or tweeted about it himself.
What about the Waffle House shooter?
What about Chicago
There were four people gunned down in a Wafflehouse in Chicago before an unarmed hero disarmed him? When?
Trudeau and Macron are real leaders, unlike you. In the face of tragedy, you're selective about who you support. What about James Shaw Jr., the hero of the Waffle House shooting? Do you support him? I guess not, since you haven't bothered to even mention that tragedy.
Trudeau is far from a "Real Leader" #Scheer2019
More so than trump is
yeah definitely more so than trump but Trudeau is worsening our economy, our federal debt hit 1 trillion dollars under his government
It is no the US being screwed by NAFTA  look at what Is doing to Canada.
What about #JamesShawJr.  American a Hero savedlives with his bare hands!


I’m stealing both 


No recognition for the hero who saved lives in Memphis. Incredibly disappointing. But then again, not at all surprising.
Go back and listen to the WH press briefings.
Also, unless I missed something, the POTUS himself has not addressed this -- has he? I could care less what SHS says. She is a lying liar who lies. As is he, but it means something for him to acknowledge and give credit where due. If I missed it, please correct me.
No she’s not a lib

I too support Toronto. I love the people of Canada and respect their president. I’m disappointed that my president never spoke out about the tragedy in our country where a white man with a gun killed 4 black people and was stopped by a brave black man without a gun.
You're so transparent and... racist. Where's the tweet about the white male who gunned down and killed four black people in Waffle House who was then apprehended and disarmed by a black man??? Oh, right, they're people of color and you hate them.
The glaring and disturbing omission by @POTUS of any thanks to American Hero, Mr James Shaw, or acknowledgment that the Waffle House shooting even occurred is unconscionable and unforgivable, IMO.
Guess you don't have any thoughts and prayers for a black American hero in Tennessee who took down a WHITE TERRORIST? Sad!
We stay with Canada to Canada
WHAT ABOUT THE WAFFLE HOUSE SHOOTING?! Condemn the shooter and praise the hero. You racist pig. #racist #sad #ImpeachTrumpNow #WaffleHouseShooter #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpCorruption #TrumpCrimeFamily #trumptreason
Trudeau is reaping what he has sown by opening Canada’s doors to terrorists. Thank God for President Trump. 
More pointless thoughts and prayers...

But you don't have any thoughts and prayers for Nashville? We DID have 4 young lives destroyed by a mass shooting. Thank God that James Shaw, a black good guy WITHOUT a gun, acted heroically. But no words from the @POTUS... Figures
Donny... 4 Americans were shot to death by an assault rifle in Tennessee. Thoughts and prayers as usual or nah?
Maybe you don't want to stand next to Donald or Donna depending how Donald dresses for the day.

Canada doesn't want your thoughts and prayers. Canada doesn't want anything to do with you. The world was a better place until you became President #makedonalddrumpfagain #MuellerIsComing #TrumpResign
Speak for yourself, I’m Canadian too, you don’t speak for all of Canada
I haven’t met a Canadian who is impressed with Trump or what he’s done. Are you ok with him spewing lies about Canada???
Pputooo
There’s some parts way up north in Canada I don’t stand with. Too cold.
On their way to Canada as Van drivers. https://edition-m.cnn.com/2015/04/16/europe/italy-migrants-christians-thrown-overboard/index.html …
Yet Americans died in another shooting this week and you said nothing! Because it was a white American pulling the trigger! Doesn't fit your "all foreigners are bad unless I marry them" propaganda
Nah, that’s ok. We good. Love 
Still no thoughts and prayers for the four young Americans slaughtered by a white supremacist?
Maybe we should have that Canadian Police Officer teach American police to shoot less. That officer was so brave and no one had to die.
But not with Tennessee?! That IS America??
Why are you silent on the tragedy that took place at the Waffle House?!? I’ll wait... #BLM
Funny #Dotard .... hates you
Frankly, the prayers are so much talk, Donnie.
Mr. Trump Please come to Canada and secure our borders. We need a strong minded individual like yourself to deal with this.
And where is your tweet about the Waffle House mass shooting?
What about Waffle House Don? Unarmed black man disarms white terrorist and saves lives isn’t good for your agenda? Shameful
How come you remain silent about the Waffle House shooting?
Большинство ненужных жертв также возникает из-за неустойчивых личностей,паникеров и фантазеров,но в мире видно это неизбежное зло.
Just wondering Fake Christian-in-Chief...how do you pray & to whom?
But still nothing on Waffle House shooting!
We all do not stand with Trudeau........he himself, is killing us. But we stand together in our tragedies as do the USA.
We have and will always stand with Canada, who we do not stand with is you, Trump.
What about some heroic man who stopped the Waffle House shooter?  Oh, yeah... he’s black so you don’t say shit!
I bet he's gutted it wasn't a terrorist attack maybe by Muslims extremists....he cannot mouth of his hate speech now.
Dan, You don't have the class to  fake it and mention Nashville tragedy? I guess it's because it involves 4 people of color murdered, a white supremcist. the father of the white supremcist, the rifle everyone wants banned andnot wanting to upset the NRA/BASE.
And still not a word from Daffy Donnie about the killings in the Waffle House. Could it be because it’s a white guy and a big fan of yours or is it because the Hero that stopped him was black?
Have you spoken to James Shaw Jr., a real American hero??
What, did you have to see that America was asking you to send our concerns to Canada. 1 day and a 1/2 shame on you.
 Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.
US might. But you trump? Nope
No comment still on the Nashville shooting?  Wonder why.....
Your thoughts and prayers mantra is getting a bit stale now and is worthless because there is not a religious bone in your obese treacherous body.
Any thoughts and prayers spare for the black people killed by a white man with an AR15? Any good words spare for the black hero? No?
WHAT ABOUT THE 4 PEOPLE DEAD AT WAFFLE HOUSE IN NASHVILLE? STAY LOCAL!
What about our country? No mention of the loss of life in the Tennessee mass shooting???  Why do we have to beg you to honor Americans who we’ve just lost? I know the answer but I want to hear you say it!  #RacistTrump
That's just plain stupid. A: HE DID COMMENT ON THIS! Just not on camera. B: It's always because their black right?
What about America? White Supremacist terrorism in both cases. #WaffleHouse
And still no word on the awful Waffle House shooting. And I thought your slogan was America first.
S T F U ! ! !
Do we stand with Tennessee and the heroic good unarmed black man who disarmed the bad white guy Nazi with an ASSAULT rifle????
I am so not surprised that you posted this but didn't even consider posting your "thoughts and prayers" for Nashville #WaffleHouse victims.
1 full day later. #KeepUp #DickHead
Sock boy has to go....
Thank you Uncie Trump!!
Canada thinks your mind is terribly limited. 
Save your rubbish.
Thoughts and prayers....yeah, right...
Hey Donald, what about the mass shooting victims at the Waffle House? I know. A white guy did it, but the guy in Canada was white too.
Except if you research incels their a big part of your support base... So America stands in solidarity, but you're not America nor are your supporters. You ppl literally are the incels, homegrown white terrorists, cousin marrying grammer school drop outs... But nice try, #lild
It took u a whole day to say anything about Toronto & u have yet to acknowledge the BLACK man who saved lives in Tennessee. Is it bc those that were killed were Latino & black? Their lives matter too not just whites. YOU'RE A RACIST PIG.
RESIGN YOU'RE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE USA
Toronto and Canada will stand strong...we are Canadiens..thats what we do..

Finally a tweet that isn’t embarrassing. Who wrote it for you?
Nothing to say about the victims of Waffle House massacre? LOSER!


U are on your way out. Because u are corrupt & not qualified
He just likes to put it out there so the people who are unable to detect nuanced behavior and only work on "face value" can confirm that "He cares" about more than himself.  Truth of the matter, he's not even tweeting this.  Look how well it's phrased.
Thoughts and prayers to a tragedy in Canada, a foreign country. But no thoughts and prayers for the tragedy in Tennessee, a US state!
WTF.

What about the Waffle House shooting? Don't want to say anything to the families of the four people shot to death? 

You're not fooling anyone.
Useless prayers again. But at least it cost no money and you don't even have to pray, you just say you did.
الإستخبارات الأمريكية وراء الحادثة لأن كندا رفضت الإنضمام إلى الولايات المتحدة وبريطانيا وفرنسا بضرب سوريا
SHUT THE FUCK UP @realDonaldTrump - YOU DON'T SPEAK FOR AMERICA #SmallDickDonald
Sooo....what about Waffle House? Oh I forgot...you don't like people of color so it's not important to you!
It is so hard to believe. The liberal media keeps saying there were no scandals under Obama. Why didn’t we hear about all these supposed issues with Admiral Jackson, which happened during Obama’s administration, before he was nominated to lead VA? Did the liberal media hide this?
Yet you still haven't said ANYTHING about the #WaffleHouseShooting
So sorry for tge tradgey in Canada! May God be with all in Canada 
Oh French! Like Macbeth.
It’s so stupid that you tweet a message to the man when he’s in the next room.
@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the ATF's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners!
First responders don't keep you safe. They clean up the mess left by the evil bad guys.
As a Canadian,go fuckkk yourself donny
Your words mean nothing because you only care about yourself.
Hey jerk off, you haven't said word one about the 4 victims at the Waffle House and the hero that prevented further tragedy. Your silence says it all...People of color don't matter to you because you're a bigot.
“Thoughts and prayers” again. 
The shooter took a page from your book, Donald. He’s a crazy woman-hater. Oh, and a racist.
Maybe you could take a few minutes to mourn the 4 black Americans that were gunned down in the Waffle House and maybe honor the unarmed black American that stopped the gunman and saved lives.
Talk is cheap to you.  Save it you criminal.
Hey Justin u banned knives after finding out about your murder rate with knives r u going to ban vans and trucks too since the terrorists u let in to kill your citizens r being ran over by them?
“Thoughts and prayers”...have to laugh but will not as it was a serious event. I say “laugh” because Trump and @GOP always respond to mass shootings or deaths with “thoughts and prayers” and then forget the events.
I thought Trudeau said he would be personally responsible for any such acts. But no, he's all hot air...
Waffle House and hero who stopped it from being worse.
Curious, not even a tweet mentioning the shooting at Waffle House.  Why is that?
Why haven’t you mentioned what happened HERE in the USA, in Tennessee?
Keep sending your bullshit prayers out there with no change to policies.  All these mass killings have your name on them @realDonaldTrump , you are a dispicable human being and an atrocious example of what an American is.
