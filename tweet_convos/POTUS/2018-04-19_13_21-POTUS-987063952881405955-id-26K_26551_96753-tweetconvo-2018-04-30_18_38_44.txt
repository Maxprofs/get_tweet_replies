I, as an American citizen wish to sue the democratic party for obstructing for over a full year, the duties of the current admin. and a duly elected president. Who will represent WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA VS THE DNC/DEMOCRATIC PARTY?
Good luck - unconstitutional?!
Really? Which amendment says so? I don't want to sue my country, just dems and the DNC.
My good Lord u show daily how stupid and uninformed u are. You lie so much. U don't know crap! Go back to school dirty corrupt Trump!
The left is such a waste.
So blaming dems u cant hire decent qualified people. Plus u don't vet anyone. People pay for thier jobs. U prove how ur a horrible business person over and over again. Sad, your hate for America shows.
Hi Donald I know you probably won’t see this but I only joined Twitter to tell you that I think you’re doing a wonderful job, and that I’m counting on you for my future.
Maybe you should do better background checks on people that you are going to put on your Cabinet. It should be noted that your Cabinet is the biggest revolving door in Presidential history. The White House has been in total chaos since you’ve taken over.
#AmericaThirst #CandyMan
For someone (good Doc) who served two presidents without incident and excellent creds from each, the only conclusion is that Trump brings out the worst in the best people he has working for him.  candyman
There is also the deal when you step out or are pushed into the political arena. Everything in your past good and bad is going to come out. In this case, it was a whole lot of bad. Allegations so far but with something like over 20 independent sources it's not looking good for RJ
If he couldn't handle the heat of these mere allegations and clear his name though the confirmation process, then I have only one thing to say:  He's unfit for the job.
Absolutely! The innocent don't run from confrontation, they crave it imo. But then again, look who's president. The fish does rot from the head...
Agree.  If I was wrongly accused of something, I would welcome the opportunity to clear my name and challenge any of my accusers to prove their BS allegations.  The last thing I would do is run...unless of course, I was guilty.
Stop whining.

Grow up.

Put on your big boy pants and be a real President.

This is the way democracy works,  to prevent despots from appointing sycophants who are just as corrupt as they are.

Try not to take it personally.

Unless the shoe fits.
Tweeting the same trash day after day. You've said all this and done nothing because Dems don't agree with you so you say they are the problem. What a crock'o'shit!

Good. Your picks have been f****** awful

Maybe if you picked people that could actually perform the job and weren’t just your rich friends, what an idea right?!?!
Yes sir, it is called "Reap what you sow" and the GOP wrote the playbook during the Obama administration. 

And you supported it then.
Again Trump tries to deflect blame for his sloppy nomination process and his perennial failure to vet nominees selected not for qualifications, but for presumed loyalty.  He promised us the best; he's given us the worst.  It isn't Democrats : it's Trump's incompetence.
As usual  this proves how much was reason for me leaving the left side and I will never vote Democrat again! #Obstructionist #Hyprocrits #DemocraticPartyAntiAmerican They Hate This President more then they love America and it’s Peoples!!!! Get the nominations passed now.
Sorry that you’re so disillusioned!

Yeah, They'll be sorry when the zombie apocalypse breaks out! Still building your #InsanityDefense I see!
No it won’t take nine years. U will be gone by January 2019 and all those positions will be filled by competent people.
Maybe u should resign now and save your own behind from more humiliation.
Gee, it must be nice living in a fantasy world where every problem is caused by “others”. No need to face the fact that YOUR party is the one slow walking everything because they don’t like your nominations!
Wow- you really aren’t bright. You need a majority for your nominees. @gop is ruling party in congress and WH. Look no further than your own party and the fact your nominees are not qualified.
Anybody out there ok with an abusive drunk, an opioid pusher & a doctor willing to lie to make #Trump seem healthier than he is with ZERO executive experience running one of the largest agencies for 9 million vets? #JonTester did the vetting YOU should have done & you attack.../1
...him? Threaten him? There is something seriously wrong with you. You made a decision without gathering all the facts. You hired someone b/c you liked/trusted them. You didn’t determine if they were qualified. What was in their past. YOU FUCKED UP. Deal with it./2
Seems to me you are the only person in Washington DC who has given anything up. Everyone else in Washington DC has made out like Bandits.
Stop firing people and vet your nominees properly. That will save a ton of time,
Today Trump told Fox, "I'm very disappointed in my Justice Department" and threatened to interfere in Russia probe. Mr. President, it's not your Justice Department; it belongs to the American people and serves the public interest, not yours. Any interference will not be tolerated
Have you ever heard of vetting? You should try it sometime. Preferably before you select someone to hold a high government position. We really don’t appreciate your mob style attempt at leadership.
GOP is In Majority!
They are in Position to Confirm.
Maybe if U sent QUALIFIED lawyers 2B Fed Judges? One neverTried case
Dear @POTUS, you said you don't want to step into the DOJ mix until the #Mueller thing is over. 

What makes us think it'll be over?

Manafort, @GenFlynn, @MichaelCohen212. Who's next? I'm sure there's someone in view. along with extended paychecks.

I don't see it ever ending.

Looks like you took a picture of yourself and put president Trump's face on it
Oooo, a 1-follower bot! So impressive! #putinbot #Bot
Making it obvious they don't care about our country, only about regaining the power they had before. The left r godless ppl, led by Satan. They're deceived & blind & don't know they're being manipulated by him to do his will. They'd rather our country burn than DJT succeed.
Is it kinda like when republicans would not even speak to Obama’s Supreme Court nominee for a year? And all your nominees are so qualified baaahhhaaaahhaaa
I think of a great way to fast-walk everything.

Maybe you should make good on your pledge of attracting the very best people rather than the losers you nominate!
Interesting the way Trump ignores the recent years of Republican obstruction - Merrick Garland?
If you vetted your upcoming appointments you would get more support. Experience counts
Biggest liar on the planet. So glad everyone is seeing that now - even Fox News!!!!
So you consider a drunk, pill pushing, harassing jerk "good" or "great" people? 
Not a surprise considering you think murderous Nazis are "Very fine people".
How are your supporters ok with this? What is wrong with them?
All your nominees are criminals. #ImpeachTrump
If you really think about this ,how can it be the Dems when the GOP is in control? It,s your own party "slow walking" your noms because they know you pick the worst people.
You should of listened to the advice Bloomberg gave you??
It is because they can't pass. They are not qualified just like you
Well, it would help if all your nominees weren’t incompetent morons. But then again birds of a feather... #DumpTrump #TrumpColluded #CorruptGOP #LiarsAndThieves #LockThemAllUp

Mr. President, thank you, worked all 3 of your properties in A.C., back in in the day when you ran them successfully. Plenty of latins, blacks, gay waiters were a dime a dozen. As a white man I was a minority, I know there's alot of ppl that know same facts. Thank you for MAGA!
Other people ran them into the ground, call them out from the bully pulpit someday, you set them up for success, they failed, shame on them.
Maybe if you nominated some people who are actuallly qualified and not diametrically oposed to the mission of the departments they would be heading. Maybe that. #BestPeople #VeryStableGenius #MAGA #Meltdown #WorstPresidentEverByFarTremendous
Maybe @realDonaldTrump your criteria should not be: willing to lie about my weight.
Then stop funding them.  Figure out how to fight back.
Since the noms are happening in the Senate, make Mitch lock the doors and force a weekend of processing...by the dims rules. Either speak up or send them through. Gotta get those entrenched deep staters out!
well said, patriot!!
Trump tends appoint faulty candidates because a bird of a feather tend to flock together.
DUH. The people you nominate are CRIMINALS

You were slow to nominate people.

You nominated people who are the Dolores Umbridge of their field.

43% of your people quit or were fired.

This is all your own fault.

And yet your party has control of both chambers. Hmmm.
MERRICK GARLAND.......
You added Scott Pruitt to the Swamp!! How many lobbyist go in the sound proof booth a week? $43,000 American tax dollars spent to make secret deals with lobbyists in a private booth.. Then they should head for the confession booth..

Extreme vetting is needed to fill the swamp!
Just a thought, maybe you should pick better people instead of incompetent nincompoops? #JustSayin

Nominate decent people vetted properly and quit putting up these chumps. Remember the judicial nominees that barely knew procedures and doctrines.
Well, if you would recommend qualified people, maybe things would work out for you. Most people learn from their mistakes, but not #DonTheCon
Yes what a shame democrats are slow walking all of your nominees. They all have worked out so well thus far. They spend most of their time interviewing people for positions that have already been filled once!

That’s because you refuse to do a proper job of vetting candidates.
your nominations are ,at best, horrible. you are afraid to surround yourself with smarter, more capable and more ethical people than you.

Democrats are doing this on behalf of the American people! It is their job to vet these people.

As witnessed (by the ones they don't have power to control) you do NOT hire the best people

Also missed your outrage when Repubs STOLE a SCOTUS seat by "slow-walking" Merrick Garland

Do what Obama did, bypass them all, make your own rules and use the ones he made to empower himself.

Mike Pompeo received more money from the Koch brothers than any other federal politician. The 11 Senators on the foreign relations committee who voted to confirm Pompeo as Secretary of State received a combined $705,415 from Koch Industries. 
…
Actually, democrats are still looking out for America by making sure the abusive people you keep trying to put in office are called out for their abusive,  illegal behavior. Seems you like like the abusers a lot. Birds of a feather perhaps?
Are you kidding me? You keep nominating people that won’t stick around or you end up firing, and now you’re going to blame that on the Democrats? Why don’t you nominate someone who isn’t corrupt?Why don’t you learn how The executive branch works.
That's because you keep putting shit people forwards. You don't have nine years. Maybe not even nine months - you know, like the nine months that women shouldn't be allowed to deliver babies at?!?!
You won't be their that long to worry about it
You attack time proven agencies that are independant agencies. Who do we believe when reps have supported your lunacy ? Not you or them. #bluewave
There’s a solution 4 that 
#MAGAGetRidOfTrump
Ending the Korean war:. Did you place Israel's foreign policy interests in front of America's economic interests for NK denuclearization
Hopefully you will have all your nominations approved.  Happy about Mike Pompeo.  Highly qualified for the job.  The same does not go for Jeff Sessions.  We feel he betrayed you by recusing himself.  He triggered nonsensical and costly Russian collusion investigation.  Fire him.
By that standard set by congress, it looks as though we may have to change a president's term to 10yr

Have we reached that level of functionality with our congress? 

Should we take 9 yrs to pay them for their services to this country?

Wages are paid with services rendered?
I thought there was a statue limitation for congress which they must make their decisions

I don't recall our Congress pulling this (Crap) UNJUSTLY act against Obama or any other president. #WTH

That is like putting in a BANK full of money in Mexico with no employees to run it.
Despite all of your boisterous bluster, you’ve really botched and blown this whole ‘presidency’ thing. What a total traitorous train wreck you are. I’ve been nauseated by you for years and saddened that our worst dullards voted for you. But now I enjoy witnessing your demise. FU.
I'm ok with that. You're people suck or get fired or get indicted.

The Dems run to the courts on every issue because the courts are in the Dems pocket always siding with the Dems against POTUS. THE GAME IS FIXED, 9th Circuit Corrupt.  Must take them out of the equation, in order to get justice.
Every court decision has sided with the Dems against Trump and conservative values, what’s wrong with this picture? Obama was the real perv, yet the courts always side with him.
#Trump is incompetent !!! Your nominees are incompetent !!! What did you expect ??? Your administration is  #Crazy !!!!
Sounds familiar.  GOP stopped Obama at every turn. Sucks doesn’t it?
Last I checked Republicans did EXACTLY THE SAME THING TO OBAMA, INCLUDING BLOCKING HIS RIGHTFUL NOMINATION OF A JUDGE TO SCOTUS. You're just a spoiled brat....
#Donthecon #Lockhimup #traitor #Lies #Fakepresident

Good(hopefully great)... this does not sound as though the are the “Best People” more like best guess.
Whats the rush you will fire them all later anyway?
Your nominations are way out in left field and your little minions that keep voting your BS in, will not be reseated.See ya Mitch, Pruitt, Pompeo, Nunez, John, Kelly Anne,Mnuchin,Betsy, Pence and the rest of your swampy group of the “Elite” entitled scums #ImpeachTrumpNowASAP
Puhleeze Dirty Donnie....YOU have set the hateful tone in today’s politics....as usual you can dish it out but not take it....you are doing a lot of whining instead of winning....

Because you have continually put people into positions that are unqualified.  DeVos, Carson, Pruitt, Hicks,  Bridenstien...just to name a few!!!  You said you know the "best people".  You know the worst people!!!!
Thats what i been saying they be dragging things out so long making it very costly for absolutly no reason. 
#Commander an Cheif you Do Not Have,To Put Up With This...#MAGA
Donald seriously if you don't calm down you're gonna have a stroke. Nothing is worth having a stroke over it.
PLEASE LIST THESE GREAT NOMINATIONS THAT ARE BEING OBSTRUCTED.  IT'S A SHAME REALLY.  LIKE WHEN MERRICK GARLAND FOR EXAMPLE, A MOST QUALIFIED JUDGE/SUPREME COURT NOMINEE COULDN'T EVEN GET A VOTE.
You hire wife beaters and adulterers and your kid colluded with Russians, oh and takes after his dad in cheating as well. I really don’t think we should be hiring anyone you pick without checking to see if they have a record first
I know! All these spousal abusers, drunk drivers, white supremacists, gambling addicts, and compromised liars just can't catch a break.
Don't worry, your indictments and impeachment will not take that long. Conspiracy to TREASON. OBSTRUCTION. EMOLUMENTS. MISAPPROPRIATION. 
We're already in a constitutional crises, you DA! 
Slow walking, is what criminals do.. to their execution. Treason, executable crime. SMILE!
Have you thought about nominating good people? That might speed up the process.
Sort of like Ronny “the drunk” Jackson? Or are we talking about your nominees that YOU have already fired (Tillerson, Flynn, Shulkin, etc.)? You’ve nominated the most heinous and unqualified individuals ever brought up for confirmation. Please spare the American public your BS.
So much winning Spanky! 
You mean like you did with Merrick Garland, you bloviating hypocrite? Your ignorance and lack of self-awareness is staggering. You are literally the worse president ever, it’s in the books. Not that you can read or anything.


Like crooked Pruitt? The Candy Man Dr. Ronny? The utterly UNQUALIFIED judges you keep appointing?

Try VETTING them first and perhaps they can get confirmed.

Or appoint someone QUALIFIED like Merick Garland!

"Slow walking your nominations?!?" If your pathetic band of nominees were even slightly qualified for the the positions you have nominated them for, this process might proceed in a quick and orderly fashion but that isn't the case, is it?
Not walking slow enough, apparently
The Senate on Thursday easily confirmed Mike Pompeo as the nation’s 70th secretary of state, elevating the current C.I.A. director and an outspoken foreign policy hawk to be the nation’s top diplomat. https://nyti.ms/2Fk3170 
STFU #TrumpPrinceOfDarkness
YEAH...

I voted against Mike Pompeo. From his calls for America to leave the Iran Deal, to his extreme views on the LGBTQ community, women, and climate change, I'm concerned that, as Secretary of State, he will embolden some of the president's most dangerous instincts and policies.
Don't worry @realDonaldTrump. You will be looong gone before then.
And you are slow walking our H2B visas ... why??? You use them
So Cheeto, McCain, Flake, Ernst, Short, Collins and Cassidy are not Republicans? The reality is that you can't come to terms that you've made yet another mistake pretending to be president.
I’d like that great American Scott Pruitt to pay for my next 1st Class travel to Morocco w side trip to Paris. Since he’s using my tax money for his high life I demand equal time! Scumbag
Have U heard @BarackObama speak highly of #RonnyJackson? Jackson was highly respected & had a bright future until u got to him & turned him into a stressed out drunken dealer. @TheRickWilson is right. U touch it,it dies.
Why don’t you try nominating qualified people instead.  Your nominees are pathetic, unfit for the positions, and like yourself unwilling to learn.  YOU are the problem, not the Democrats.  #DumpTrump #notmypresident
Because there are Republicans who find your nominees to be lacking! Democrats are not obstructionist, we just have common sense and we don't follow you blindly!!
Sue them for collusion on your picks!
Look at the clown car of a cabinet & nominations you've made. Maybe it is the nominator who is the problem.
You keep putting up inexperienced and unqualified people.
Thank you sir!
#TheGreatAwakening #QAnon #WWG1WGA #WWG1WGA #WWG1WGA #WWG1WGA #UnitedWeStand
The system in place for vetting cabinet positions is no different from the one previous presidents used. It worked for them then and it is not working for you because you do not have the skill set & knowledge to perform the job.
1. GOP controls Senate
2. Nominations need only a majority vote. 
3. GOP Senators control the pace
4. You're famous worldwide as a liar
"The mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"
PIECE OF SHIT!
Try vetting your selections so you don’t pick a heavy drinking/pill pusher; a wife beater; liars; arrogant divas spending taxpayers money faster than they would their own.  And WHO is the military staff member HOOKED on PERCOCET?
Nominate people for those 70+ state department position. Then you can criticize Democrats for blocking nominations. Dr. Ronnie wasn’t blocked, he withdrew.
