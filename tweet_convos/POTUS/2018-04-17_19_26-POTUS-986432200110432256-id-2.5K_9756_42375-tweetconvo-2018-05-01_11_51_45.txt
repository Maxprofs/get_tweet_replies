Unite our allies

Amen Corey. 
TRUMP 2020
2020 out of office


Shut up now Donnie - we know you’re stressed.

Incoming pathetic leftist inbound! Man the battle stations! Load the Trump guns!FIRE THE TWEETS!
How unfortunate for Abe!

on what grounds?
Obstruction of justice. Trump is playing you. Wake up.
and how is he playing me, he has done everything i would want a president to do for this great country
How did he obstruct justice? I’ll wait.
What an honor to have a President who is respected by the most important leaders of the world. We spent the last 8 years before Trump being laughed at. Now the world is asking us "what can we do for you"! #MAGA #KAG
Grown man that tweets like a high school bully.



Get out of our country if you dont like it!

True story.
What a crock...
You should be hosting him at the White House.
Quit holding his hand!
Did you know you are only slightly more popular than acne?

Sir, you're working too hard!  Take a break you deserve it.  Thanks for doing your best to #MakeAmericaGreat
Are you kidding? He golfs all the time! SAD!
No kidding.  The only difference between doing work at your desk or on the course is the fresh air and exercise is good for you.  Happy!
I'm 100% sure there's a much bigger difference than just fresh air and exercise.
The differences are you're not in an office, you're relaxed, nobody listening, a lot of advantages for a smart person to use..
Nobodies listening? You'd have to be a complete fool to think that you aren't being listened to! Anyone who calls themself a smart person would know that.
True, being listened to, and being heard, are two different things.
You're not helping your case...
Hello dear sarr Apne kemon Aeche
Yea, you look totaly honored to be there
Welcome to AMERICA!

At my golden palace, where I can fleece all these Japanese people who accompanied Abe, and line my pockets every time I host a leader at Mar-A-Lago.  Who knew?
Lol


You are an amazing man. Keep going. You are doing the work of an army. God Bless you, your family and mankind. Thank you for making such a difference!

Go Trump Go!!!
Way to go Mr President
When these “State” events are at Mar-a-Lago, who pays for them? I assume we, the taxpayers do. 
But who gets the check? Your business?
Let’s not even talk about the free advertising he gets out of it. Whole place being professionally photographed at our expense. Not to mention us paying for it to be decoarted to host state dinners. Unbelievable.
Wow you people are small
What was said that isn’t true?
I'm just saying your comments are small
How’s that, exactly?
You take something positive and turn it negative with no proof of what you're saying
No proof?

Does he not visit his properties every weekend? Sometimes more. 

Does he not decorate his properties for state visits?

Do we not pay for the staffing and decor to be sent to FL?

Did he not double the fee to his club, making it $200k, right after he won?

Great Job!

Good lock

Jokers! How much did that cost you???
Wow, that looks great with the Japanese  and the American flag together.  What a beautiful place  is Mar-a-lago. It is very much like the White House.

You have no honor, sir! You, and your followers do not, AND will not represent the ideals of this nation! #Resist #BlueWave2018 #Spanky
Thanks President Trump for everything!
Please elaborate...
Check out my podcasts!
Best President ever
We love you President Trump
No, "we" don't.


You are the worst
Just grab em by the pussy 

Morals matter !!!
He's mired in scandal just like you and speculation is he may not last long. Here's hoping the same for you!


Oh yeah...



Her time is Coming......
Give Hillary Hell

KONICHIWA 
You have no honor
You describe yourself as an Obama Republican? Have you sought Mental help?

Makes my heart feel good to see all those marines that died in the South Pacific wasn't for nothing. It took many years but here we are the United States president shaking hands with the Japanese whatever he is prime minister I guess makes my heart feel good thank president Trump



.
@realDonaldTrump may never leave Mar - A - Lago again
Doubtful you will either, but the taxes you've contributed towards his trips there and to his other properties would probably buy you a membership, currently $200,000.
We are happy to help a PRES who loves USA.  Been a longggggg time
Were you born 2 years ago?  That would explain your reply.
What is it with you Trump supporters?  Never, ever reply with anything of substance, like facts.
Mr. President, congrats on end of Korean War! Hats off to you!
Shouldnt these meetings ne conducted at The White House or Camp David...NOT your privately owned Hotel leaving us tax payers to pay the bill
Gee, I don't know. Why don't you ask Obama, given the dozens of extended trips he took to Martha's Vineyard, Hawaii, etc. at unprecedented taxpayer expense. In many cases, to meet with no one in any official capacity. If that standard applies to one, should apply to all.
Theres a difference btwn a vacation & conducting National Business. Martha's Vineyard is a Presidential Retreat...Not owned by Obama! Idiot!
Это Моя большая честь принимать @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo!  @realDonaldTrump
China first, Japanese garbage
Japan and Germany are far more qualified for the permanent member of UN council than the two axis of evil Russia and China. @UN
một vị tổng thống quá nhàm
Sadly, he was hoping to meet someone with honor as well, but got stuck with you
Conducting Meetings with foreign officials in your private club is very strange and unethical

There you have it #MAGA.  You got $75 and the rich people got $Millions.   It's not that Trump and Ryan got it wrong.  It's that Trump, @GOP and @FoxNews lied to you.  Until you accept the truth of that you'll never get more than $75.  
…


Are your taxes going up next year?  If you’re not wealthy or a corporation, you have a 30% chance of paying more taxes next year, higher if you live in a blue state. And your kids will definitely pay much more — the GOP borrowed from them to lower the corporate rate even further.
He means California or New York us over 4 million working Americans will be ok an we will remember no liberal Dem voted for the tax break.Dems plan raise taxes to pay for their entitled programs that has destroyed this Country.

منور
Next meeting: Iwo Jima? Could be a nice symbolic gesture from both Countries.
.@realDonaldTrump has made America a shameful place with his treason, lies, corruption, racism and misogony. Great? April 17 21:26:57
Memo to President : We are going to need a bigger Train !

You are the most vulgar and embarrassing person to ever occupy the White House.
Did you #GrabAnyoneByThePu$$y? #AskingForAFriend who is working in a #CoalMine in #Kentucky and does not have access to #Twitter.

Why don’t you greet visitors at the White House instead of Florida??  You continue to make America pay for your home in Florida and your many golf outings.  This should stop!  Personally I don’t like supporting your lifestyle!!!
NOT MORALLY FIT!  #BASTA

The DOJ and yanked democrats trying to set up the Donald so that impeachment cuz' they know they are losing the next election...phony story about SD,collusion etc...Very SAD


Defending President Trump in Russia probe: Several  lawyers asked to help represent Trump have spurned the assignment at least partly out of concerns he wouldn't pay his bills, sources say http://cbsn.ws/2qEOs9q  

Who's distracting you in the back of the room?
He sees something to grab. #impeach45
Putin, come swoop your boy up.
You have no honor.
Fore!!!! Spend another $million golfing!
Could your golf course look any more like a brothel?
You are a tool.

This guy comes from the other side of the world and gets an invite where I live just a few miles away I haven't even been invited for lunch. Come on Donald we can talk about the old days in construction up in new york..
It's funny this clown thinks he can order people to do stuff still how cute. He's so in over his head lmao. Should of impeached him on the pussy comments now it would just be embarrassing like his Twitter page. How far we have sank as a people and nation.
You have no honor.
Did you give him a hard and grip handshake? Let him go? No!
Your tie is ridiculous.
hehe
How long did you hang onto Abe’s hand this time, Grifter Don? For dear life, I suppose!
posso presentir o perigo e o caos.... 


Actually you seem to fit that well.
jesus you literally have the schedule of a 75 year old retiree
most obliging.
Boring Boring Boring. Please go back to shouting and insulting people.
Resign

Yeah right, every thing is your “great honor”. You have no idea how sick of you the majority of us are.
ありがとうございます

Trump you had ask black people what do they have to lose it seem that I lost my citizenship or being a regular citizen in America because I see that illegal immigrants have more rights than I do and thanks for the new judge that just sold all American citizens out
Trump showing Abe how corrupt he is as he personally profits off Abe's visit.

Thanx!
Why are you afraid of a man who killed his people with a chemical weapon, Bashar al-Assad, on him to leave


real negro hours #resign
二傻逼
Who's the fellas on top of the column? Interesting......very interesting 
It seems JPN_PMO's hand is tender and smooth, Trump can't help touching and feeling its softy in Pic 2. Here should be inserted with an Ads of Japanese hand cream.

What a pity he will be tasked with suffering the insufferable POTUS.  My thoughts and prayers are with him.
Why he just not smile in any way
Have you ever seen an asshole smile? #impeach45

One crock to another #ImpeachTrumpNow
Thank you for sharing your agenda with me; us. We are hounored  to be included in your day!
