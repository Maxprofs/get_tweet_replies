The man in charge of the WH is a cowardly draft-dodger.

Nice try ...
Tell us all about Obama and Clintons exemplary military careers.
What you need to know is Obama wasnt a draft dodger & he was not corrupt nor did he need many many lawyers to cover up his unethical deeds I'm often bewildered about what type of person that could support such a pathological corrupt liar; It must be someone who has similar traits
Do you have a clue how much he spent sealing his college records.


Thank God for President Trump. I've waited so long for a President who values our military, first responders, Constitution and faith.
here's your 30%  trumpanzee... They like trump cause he don't use no big fancy words......
As a person of color I'm offended by your racist language.

Trump has spent about one third of his days as president on a golf trip.
Our tax dollars at work. 
He donates all his presidential earnings back to your country - wake up #Qanon #WWG1WGA pay attention - even I can see it from Scotland...
He charges the US millions for the use of HIS resort that he is staying at to golf for 33% of his time in office. We pay to get him there. We pay for his quarters there we pay for the swcret service to stay there and all of that money goes into his pocket.  He is costing millions
Thank you

Thank you boss Donald J. Trump 
And your master,  Trump, has never apologised for anything.

RHINO REPUBLICANS ARE DEMOCRATS
Then make sure you don't vote for any Republicans Steve.
Thank you. You couldn’t have come at a better time to save this Country.
And I will pay off hookers and get pissed on! I promise!
Haters gonna hate @POTUS Thank you for the job your are doing thank you from saving us from HRC and the Democratic Party! Now please #ReleaseTheTexts #NoRedactions
you should thank putin, remember trump said only the mob plead the 5th. ohhh... you forgot all about that didn't you. ha ha ha ha lol lol
Wounded Warriors? The same org that screwed millions of Vets?
GOD BLESS all our Heroes! 
America spent about $ 200 million on a missile attack on Syria. How much money did America spend to protect its children at schools? The answer is 0. Do we have enemies in the USA Government? Yes, we do.
Hey Alex, school budgets are local.  Take it up with your school board.
This is not an answer. All money belongs to the Americans, not to the government. School budgets should be a priority for the US government, not illegal military interventions. The US government should work for Americans. This is democracy.
I can tell you aren't an American
Hahahaha
God bless you all from us in Scotland too 
Lynn thank you for being a friend from across the pond, the left in our country didn’t even give him a day before they started on him, I believe the USA will pull through all the idiotic days the left is causing here, Trump has a strong personality, and don’t take any crap.
Thanks Neal - it helps that I don’t watch tv so wasn’t brainwashed.... he isn’t affected by the BS cos he is a good guy fighting evil. I know a good man when I see one.
How can you not support the potus
Aleluyaaa..

Not supporting the president doesn’t make someone a traitor. So that means u were a traitor during obama since u didn’t support him
No I dont think either were or are traitors but was replying to RIPGOPs stupid tweet.

I voted for President Trump. I don't care for all that he says or does but I respect his win and stature now. It saddens me the controversy surrounding, but this right here is why I voted for him. Love his devotion to our Troops.

  @realDonaldTrump

Good to know that you're ok with valid threats being made against the personage if our President.

Let's me know exactly that I'm correct in  reporting and blocking you
He just keeps doing very presidential things day after day!  Keep going Sir!!
If the d.. people would just leave trump alone he can be a president
This vow means as much as the wedding vows to his 3 wives
Where do ad hominem attacks lead you?...
Saying #FatDonnie is a habitual liar whose word is worthless is not an ad hominem attack. It is a documented statement of fact
Just another lie
Sometimes people don't realize in life that its the little things that matter the most. Thanks for your continued effort to support the country that I love and cherish the most GO USA!!!!!!!
Yes that’s my President!! And my three military boys say he’s their president too!! Wake up America before it’s too late!! God bless all in uniform.
BS
Who’s writing is this?? Certainly not the little guy who failed remedial English!! These WH posts are ALWAYS so AMUSING!
I can tell that was written for you.
Does anyone remember how he insulted the Gold Star Family
How he told the wife of a fallen soldier that "..he knew what he signed up for
how he said McCain was not a hero
His disdain for the military & their sacrifices is VERY CLEAR as is Using Wounded Warriors as a distraction
Yet you're cutting #SNAP benefits which many Military and #Vets #Veterans depend on to feed their families
Thank you for helping our honorable veterans get the support they should have had all along. GOD BLESS YOU.
I unfortunately could not join the Marines but my brother and my father-in-law as well as a few of my friends served. It is an honor and a privilege to serve this country and our people. I only wish that I could have done more. I am now a state certified peer support worker.


Y'all know Cadet Bonespurs can't wait to send you to war, right? He loves wounded warriors so much he wants to make more. Effing draft dodger.
Yet you have already cut budget funding that directly hurts many veterans and their families and have promised to cut funds further. Which side of your face are we to believe?
The one he sits on
That why you’re trying to privatize the VA?
If the VA was privatized money would be saved. That's why It should be privatized & care would be better because the companies would be competing for the VA business.
Love my President!
you can have him.
Thank you! But, if you live in America, he is your President too! Wake up leftyLove, Love my President!
You’re the one who is sleeping! Lol! He is the President of the United States but he is not legitimate. He is the biggest crook ever and an assault on our Democracy and all we stand for. He is very ill. Even Fox News couldn’t stand his ranting & cut him off.
Thank you for giving Fox and Friends the ratings, and you couldnt hold yourself and watched our President! You didnt have to and you did..i see some love to OUR "American President "
#MAGA #KAG #WakeUpAmerica #WWG1WGA #QAnon
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR HONORING OUR SERVICE MEN & WOMEN!
In my opinion these are MEN&WOMEN 
that will never be forgotten before and after there greatest moments in the American military defending us and our great nation. TRUE HERO'S. 
Your compassion and support of those who serve and protect us is appreciated by most Americans.
Nice to have a President who loves America and is especially committed to our military, who put it all on the line everyday to keep America safe.
Thank you for what you are trying to do, in the short time you have been in office...the useless swamp, which has been in office these many years, has NEVER shown respect to those who lay down their lives, deserve. Stay hard and stand strong.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump 

Lol!  Sure. 
Until you take their health care away by privatizing the VA...
#DownWithUSA 
#مرگ_بر_آمریکا
I think we know by now that if Mr. Trump makes a promise, he is lying. He has no intention of keeping such a promise. All he wants is a great photo op for his base.
Trump, you used bone spurs, to avoid going into the service, yet now you have so much respect for our Vetrans. I'm not buying your b.s.
He is only interested in Vets cuz he wants to privatize VA so he and his wealthy friends PROFIT. Schulkin did not agree so he was eliminated and Dr Ronny was a stooge that would do what he was told. After all he lied about tubby tuba’s weight and BP
...but only the ones who don’t get captured. I only like the soldiers who don’t get captured.
And he hires the ones paid by other countries to kidnap people
Russian consulate in Seattle which is a property of Russia, was hacked. This is another crime committed by the American Government. Don't expect they will have a different attitude towards American citizens.
Hey Spanky mcBone Spurs #karma #Mueller
i'm sorry.  the draft dodger said what?
When was the last president that actually served?
There’s a difference between not signing up and dodging the draft.
Oh so this is just more screaming about nothing then. You guys are getting pretty easy to understand now
Serious question....
Insults are all you got ? 
I better leave you and you tiny mind alone as you obviously can’t handle anything serious
That wasn’t an insult, it was a question. Still waiting for an answer.
Your tiny mind still having trouble. Your easy to understand

Right on..  let’s do it
Lying James Comey on Fox News tonight. Sure is dancing around questions. Nothing specific. I think I don’t recall not to my knowledge.
Yes he is "crawfishing". Also 13 minutes late - poor form. "I don't remember ". 
Noble draft Dodger.

#FakePesident
God bless you President Trump
Oh yeah let’s here it for the 5x drafter dodger who wants to give congratulations for something he dodged!!!
Except I need to privatize your health care and make some money

Donald J Trump was my choice in 2016, and will be again in 2020. I prefer "Common Sense" NOT what the Liberal Left DemocRATS call Political Correctness!!!!
Dam it’s nice to have such a patriotic potus
Thank you. 28 years in the Army
And yet you nominate two terrible, terrible people to run the VA.
Actions speak louder than words.
#TrumpPropaganda 
#TrumpLiesMatter
Hmm, I think that means that you have to nominate a QUALIFIED person to head the VA. Duh. #IllegitimatePresident
Then try nominating an actual qualified person to be over the VA.
Oh! Is that why Trump nominated a completely unqualified person to run the VA?
Then YTF did he try to appoint the Candyman to run the VA?!
I just can't even...
Wow, he really is uplifting the Hebrew Bible.  I agree, but it's weird because of the, Freedom of Religion.  So- what is our future?  I know one thing, I can easily tolerate different Religions, but not Evil People.  Some, don't even claim a "God"- and are just plain Wicked. 
May God bless America 
#MAGA #LockThemUp #WWG1WGA
Thank you to all who serve and who have served. Thank you for all you do President Trump. May God bless you as well.
A shame @ChrisCuomo couldn’t find anything to report on except for a misspelled word on a @POTUS tweet.

#WoundedWarriors #Veterans #Military #AmericanPride 
#USA #PitifulNews @RedNationRising #Media
#ComradeTrump - the words of a Draft Dodger who has many times belittled soldiers who served with distinction and honor are an affront to our valiant warriors. Your words are as hollow as your Russian-owned soul.
Over 1.5 MILLION VETS are on Medicaid! Your tax cuts gutted Medicaid & Medicare of over 
ONE TRILLION Dollars. 
Make no mistake, you did not help VETS with your tax rich friends tax cuts
Worse president ever ...sad

American soldiers are not calling President Donald Trump a draft dogger.
Then fund the VA for more staff and facilities!
Sorry, but I'm still pissed at program execs who misused money for parties and other bullshit. Never forget.
Great! Thank you. NOW, end 50+ yrs #Systemic #VAcorruption. Compensate Vets retroactively for #Unjust denials of legit benefits claims. 50+ yrs #Overdue. MAGA 
Maybe find a VA head with some relevant experience?
If you care so much about vets; why did you submit for confirmation someone to head the VA who is not qualified?  Stop the nonsense and give is a break.
That's a nice bike. Can @realDonaldTrump even ride one?
By recommending a drunken drug dealer to run the VA?  You have a very strange way of implement your promise.



Forget or help? 2018 veterans now must pay for even their generic drugs unless they can get them on base. Really?
Thanks for honoring these veterans!!!
Awesomeness
Unless, of course, you are transgender.
We, the veterans of America, support you all the way Mr. President @realDonaldTrump - and this one prays daily for you, sir.

WTG

You gotta love incompetence.  Hahahaha!
GOD BLESS U WOUNDED WARRIORS
#Thankyouforyourservicebydavidwilcox
America Will Be Great Again!
Thank you For Your Service
YET you stated  MCCAIN A WAR HERO. WHO WAS CAPTURED AND STILL DID NOT TALK a NON HERO. DO YOU remember that. They are his PEERS YOU SALUTE BUT NOT HEROS THAT PAVED THE WAY FOR. THE US MILITARY SHOULD STIKE AGAINST. BET THAT PUT YOUR RACISM TO A HAULT.
Charity Navigator subtracts the fundraising and -- in its most recent report --“the Wounded Warrior Project spends less than 60 percent on its services. The rest, according to Charity Navigator, went to fundraising and administration.”
Ronny Jackson, a US Navy rear admiral and doctor, was drunk on the job and created an opioid epidemic within the walls of the White House.

He'll get a full pension unless he's court-martialed and convicted (which he absolutely should be).
Says the guy who can't keep anybody running the organization that helps these people
You could start by finding a nominee with some actual policy experience to run the VA. You won’t though... your entire statement is hollow lip service. You’ll find another chronic whom you won’t properly vet and all these men and women will suffer because of it. #POtuS

What an awesome POTUS we have!
You can prove that by selecting a person to head the Dept. Of VA who has a modicum of experience in large health care facility administration.
May God Bless you Mr. President
Thank you President Trump.
Amen!
never to forget the wounded warriors  those who sacrified their lives; to defend the american values to give peace and freedom to all nations in need .
As a 27 year Navy Veteran, this warms my heart. It was my honor to serve. God bless these warriors and more thanks than words can convey to you Mr President for your  words and support. Whatever I may be or not be, I am a VETERAN! Thank you Veterans- God bless you.
♡♡♡
And the first thing you can do is approve Shulkin’s recommended new disease additions to Vietnam Veterans Presumptive list. Unconscionable you have not approved them. Specifically bladder cancer. Stagnating in OMB. Vets dying too soon from herbicide exposure
Thank you
Thank you sir.  I have seen so many vets suffering
Now that’s a President who really cares about our heroes!
Not just talk!!
MAGA!
Too much Sir, thank you very much
Thank you Mr President.   #KAG

♡♡♡
Best PRESIDENT In my time MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Did you take any of their Purple Hearts?   You said you always wanted on of them. I guarantee that everyone of them would gladly give you their medals in exchange for their limbs back. And yet you joked about it.
Most inspiring tweet of the day! 
At least he cares more than Obama did good job Mr President
NOW, This is a PRESIDENT!!!
Thanks Mr.President for taking care of our veterans
God Bless those participating in the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride

Don't trust Trump! He is a perpetual liar! He lies so much that he can't differentiate between lies and the truth!
Wow wonderful
It was my honor, sir

Amen
Yes!
Please support new California
Amen
True
AMEN!🕇

Watched this, super.  Wonderful, our Finest.

Thanks! And too all soldiers and veterans you must go on to see your self as family, and take more Care on those that don't have the strength after service! Help them to come out from there mental prison war create for some!
President Trump  is Great！
BRAVO MR TRUMP! SEI UN GRANDEEEE UOMO! 
@WhiteHouse

HELL YEAH! 
When you nominate a drunkard doctor with no experience in managing an organization as large and as important as the VA, what does that say about your commitment to our vets?
I don't remember Barry doing this ....?
President Obama never needed the PR facelift. He wasn't a rapist under federal investigation.
Veterans it's time to stop being used as a spoken word by politicians that use us for a vote!
We know. That's why the #TrumpTrain is growing by the day. It's easy to support a @POTUS that loves our whole country the way I do. 
! Keep practicing you could be the next Richard Pryor. 
We had a genius for a president. Trump 2020 there snowflakes president was seven glorious years.

@realDonaldTrump didn’t write this tweet: it’s grammatically correct, no misspellings, and, “NO COLLUSION” isn’t contained within it. Also, he doesn’t give a damn about our military personnel or veterans.
Yeah he only signed a bunch of legislation to improve the VA and increased the funding for our military. That is exactly what someone would do who doesn’t care.

What a completely different America since the election of trump. Obama was nothing but a communist lackey. We are so blessed his Marxist agenda is gone. God bless this great country. God bless all the opportunities we all have. God bless and take care of Trump.



U should open old and new base and give all homeless vet a place to live for free.
@POTUS how about giving my man his re-enlistment bonus that is 1.5 years overdue...
I also would like to make a special pledge for the love of good. Please vote below and make a dream become a reality, to help others less fortunate, here in the UK I also have a dream.
Help me get my business in front of Richard Branson - hit the link to vote for me in @vmbusiness #Voom Pitch 2018: https://voom.virginmediabusiness.co.uk/pitches/monument-music-festival …
I LOVE TRUUUUUUMP!!! Hands down love the MAN! He does things I don’t like but WHO THE F DONT? My kids piss me off once a day . However I’ll gladly take the 4% of bad and 96% good everyday.
Wish those words actually meant something!
You’re so disingenuous.
Blah blah blah.
My nephew lost a leg and was badly burned over 30% of his body in Iraq/US Army. He's always had trouble with the VA. Has even been told he's not injured enough after evaluations. Legs don't grow back and burn scars never heal. Its been a nightmare for him since 2006
And money that could be used for veterans will be used instead on a parade to stroke Cadet Bone Spurs ego.
Is that why y'all are fighting for a pill poppin doctor to be the new VA? >.> fuck outta here with your lies
You’re the USA boss and the best boss ever...
From Billy Bonespurs
That is why I voted and will stand by my President...President Donald Trump! 
Means a lot to real heros, coming from capt.bonespurs
Right on Mr President!  Soldiers have served in all capacities - turning in a blank check to Uncle Sam, always ready to defend and serve our country.  It was my honor to do so.  My country owes me nothing in return, but appreciate what it did and does for me and family.
We are proud of you. Anyone who feels otherwise is just being jealous. When you admire the good things, the good things come to you. We admire your determination and endeavor
Is that similar to the sacred commitment you made to serve America at the time of the Vietnam War? You weasled your way out of military service and have demonstrated since that you lack courage, ethics or any sense of dignity. You are truly a waste of human flesh.
Love our vets and how our President supports and loves our military families
Where was your sacred commitment when you chickened out 5 times...oh I remember it was in youre foot spurs
Just so long as you have never been captured, because we don’t support the weak people who have been captured!
Thanks you Mr.President D.J.TRUMP I thinks my self you do tremendous jobs for this Cuntry AMERICA hast to be very Happys to have you are President God bless you
Get a qualified person to run the VA would be a step in the right direction. Remember Bush had his buddy running FEMA, the horse guy, then Katrina hit? Looked like a complete idiot. I was 81130 MOS USAF. I've been sick, a Mgr, that doesn't mean I can run VA.
Sure, that’s why you tried to install an alcoholic as payback for telling your lies.
God bless you for having a heart.
