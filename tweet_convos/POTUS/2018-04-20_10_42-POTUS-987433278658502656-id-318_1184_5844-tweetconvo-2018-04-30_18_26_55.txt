How do we defend against a President that has lost touch with reality.
Hillary isn’t the President. 
Donald Trump won. #MAGA
Security is more than just being armed. Multifaceted stability is important, starting here and spreading to our allies and other countries. I am tired of Trump lobbing economic, social, and governmental grenades. #StopTrumpocracy #integritycounts
Are you purple from holding your breath maybe? Your worried about Security, your party won't give him the wall, that they were for, be4 they
Were against. He is also about to get NK to give up there Nukes so as far as lobbing grenades lol lady go back to your safe place lol
POTUS is failing at bilateral talks and alienating our allies with tariffs while simultaneously disrupting our markets with TwitterTrade policy and Willy nilly exemptions. Just let him resign, he clearly hates the job almost as much as he hates America.
What is your opinion on Trump bring north Korea to the table?
If talks actually get underway and some mutually beneficial agreement is reached I’ll be impressed, even more so if POTUS can stay off Twitter/news and not sour the diplomacy/enrage our allies.
Actually talks are already underway. We'll see how it goes.
In other words, "more weapons means more peace." What a load of horse crap. Is the NRA running our foreign policy? Did Trump invest in @northropgrumman or something?
Good point. This seems like the year of the rich squeezing every last coin of profit from hard working Americans. Then when the administration leaves they can laugh to the bank. While we and our great grandchildren pay back there debt.. No one can blame a Democrat for this one!
Does the #notPresident believe that Russian hookers are the best looking in the world? What about America first? @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @VP
Do you actually believe an ageing hooker?  The dirt searchers are amoebas. She doesn't care about who she hurts, no character or integrity. FLOTUS knows better and you should too. If our Pres drinks water with the wrong hand on the glass, they would gossip!

Arms dealer to the world. You get an arms deal, you get an arms deal.....
The arms dealers in the US then just sit back and rake in the tax free cash and watch the world tear  itself apart.
Merica!
Give it to them, the freeloader Europeans. No increase in spending? Up the tariffs. About time the Germans stop using WWII as an excuse
Make EU countries take a bigger stake in their own defense. Then we’ll stop hearing nonsense about their “successful” implementation of socialism.

Hold off on the parade... we're not there yet.
If we band together, and weed out hate, this is our spriitual rain dance that shall unleash the blue wave flood for weeding out the trump
And when our country is led by a narcissistic baby-man who is morally unfit to serve, there is greater instability and less respect for America.
Thank God Obama is gone.
Damn straight
Wouldn't the American services be better out if harms way if the people they're facing don't have guns? And what about the kids you're meant to protect?

I’M not anger
Let the POTUS TRUMP know that Military retired don't have vision insurance with their medical, and or dental.
GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP! #MAGA! 

The problem is when the tide turns and those weapons are aimed at us.
BUILD AMERICA NO MORE CATCH AND RELEASE, LIVES LOST AND BILLIONS WASTED
@realDonaldTrump When Trump is a respectful participant in global affairs, respects our Allies, respects our NATO partners...then America can work well 2 sustain our democratic values. Trump's grifting kakistocracy is not respected. #Muellertrainrolling #theresistance #dotard
SO NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY SELLING ARMS??? Is this the new NRA AGENDA since gun sales are plummeting? You are so transparent and easy manipulated. 
#TrumpIsAWarCriminal
Most of our allies have been in existence longer than we, they should be well-equipped by now.
WHO IS IN LINE FOR THESE GOVT CONTRACTS? 
FOLLOW THE MONEY! 
ON BOTH SIDES !!!
Just seems a sure fine way for our enemies and def industry competitors to get hold of our latest technology and weapon systems and then reproducing it probably at a cheaper price , unless we plan to sell less capable variants of our Equipment ??
China already has....step up and keep up
Point taken but I'd like to think since we are aware China Russia probably North Korea maybe Iran too have been hacking DOD and a number of Def companies data bases we are now making it harder for them, with this move I guess not 

You mean like Iraq, Libya, Vietnam? Nato? UN peacekeepers, Mexican Army, Saudis, India Nationalist Chinese, south Korea, , American National Guard, ICE,....and more coming
As long as those countries or factions don't remain allies and turn those weapons against us.
I unconditionally agree with this.
US Gov is dysfunctional, unable to prioritize saving life on earth w/peace, vs profits over weapons of war, as Gov is programmed trapped in a cycle not knowing any other economy. Humanity has answers now to end all Military, end toxic weapons of war/Nuclear use/waste/fossil fuels
What we don’t have is cooperation. You’re speaking to the choir.
The Brand New Congress and Green party have similar platforms, and I believe all now should be working together to co_evolve w/mindfully acting or step down to gain understanding, for skilled priorities are needed and we have a plan to fuel all to do one's local `plan. Thank you!
So happy and proud of you, OUR PRESIDENT, gosh all of people I know are happy, well except, Brown. Not going to call him Governor, he doesnt represent his people, just his agenda.
And remember,  Russia is neither one of our allies nor a partner.

Just heard of yet another Demoncrat Highschool shooting in Ocala Florida today!
We know the Demoncrats are doing it.
Why are we allowing them to murder our citizens?
It's time to outlaw the Demoncratic party!

Always a Demoncrat!

I hope this doesn’t include regional trouble makers Pakistan who are responsible for instability in Afghanistan & India. Their intelligence service is responsible for the death of countless American service men
James comey for President 
SECRET SERVICE ON NEWS INVESTIGATING PINK EXPLOSIVES STOLEN FROM WKSITE - reporting nothing found yet - hope it's all found and the reason for it exposed and whos involved too !!!  GOD BLESS THE USA AGAIN 
The people you are going to need to defend yourself against are THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  #TheResistance2018 #justsaying
*****DOES NOT APPLY UNDER CURRENT ADMINISTRATION*****
You guys dropping the tax scam line and going with fear mongering? Classic
Yes, when our allies & partners are better equipped to defend themselves,there is greater regional peace & stability. The U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy is the first step in a wider effort to achieve greater efficiency & flexibility in U.S. defense trade.

Hi,mr president, we youngs of Iran need your help, please don't accept Iran nuclear deal anymore, Ayatollahs and their families are 500000 people,all are billionaire but we are so poor , we are ok with economy deals with EU and England.
Thanks
And especially for Raytheon.
yes , it makes sense.  If they will carry on once we've helped them gain their ground. If not, let it be their problem. 
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP   LIe to us again then as to WHY the military budget had to be increased and our national debt the highest in history. HAHA.  CAUGHT YOU
Not so sure I trust our so called Allies,1 is responsible for starting world war 1,the British, another likes beheadings, Saudi Arabia,and another has called for all 57 Muslim nation's to form a massive 5 million man army, after they conquer Israel, where will they go?
To bad we are doing the opposite
Not sure highlighted statement in attachment is still true. The US may produce effective 'offensive' weapons, but judging by the fail in Syria the other day, it seems the Russians produce the best 'defensive' weapons, which sort of defeats the point, no?
That is good sense like it should be.


To understand the reason for the current Chaos, it is enough to realize that Bergoglio denies Christ and His Truth ... if a Pope arrives at that ... everything becomes clear ...

…
Oil prices on the rise. .. who does it benefit. Wallstreet laughing all the way to the bank. . AGAIN.
Theres one dude in office that if you got rid of people might have a much easier job and an even easier time applying for jobs once his "shift" is done
very true we cannot make peace for the world. Evil will do its best to win . Every country must train their young men on the battle lines and take ours off of it . Draft is what other countries should be doing not volunteer .
First define who the trustable partners are for now and the future.
No more Weapons to genocide Israel.
peace thru strength,  mutual assured destruction is a myth.
to live in peace, prepare for war. or my unit motto in the 7th bomb wing

Give them nukes.  Right? Isn't that what you said?

Never thought of it that way! Thank you!!! So glad you are our POTUS.
Just like Kurd defenders in Africa?

Until those weapons are stolen, resold or otherwise fall into the hands of rogue actors. Don't you people read history?  See: Osama bin Laden, Afghanistan, Russian invasion.
Arms marketing :D :D
Instead of saying...my economy is falling down, please come and buy from me! Begging for help
Putinesque Propaganda folks!
AND a win for our robust arms industry.  MAGA!
Maybe. American retreat can mean less influence. Please consult with professionals on this.
#MAGA
YES AMERICA MUST HOLD ITS ON - if not we will be swept away too !!!  Europe targeted to become swamped in 20yrs is already underway !!!  MAGA & KAG !!!  Make it happen PREZ TRUMP - your our only hope 
CONGRESS THROUGH US CITIZENS UNDER THE BUS A LONG TIME AGO - worthless to US NOW !!!  GO TRUMP USA TRAIN STATION TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT 
Your poll numbers will go even higher when the economy  routinely  hits 3% annual gdp,something democrats did not accomplish in 8 obama years.
Has to hit it once before it can hit it routinely.
@realDonaldTrump @GOP @POTUS
Retweet this ... SDNY Attorneys Office has Michal Cohen's EVERYTHING!! 

EV-ER-Y THING!!!
Cannot wait until we get to see some actually important stuff, ie: ALL of Lynch, Comey, Rice, McCabe, Strosk, Clinton, Powers, and Obama's stuff! Oh heads are going to roll. #MAGA #Trump #LockThemAllUp #LiberalLogic
All revelations are welcome, And all speculation will be combed through, but as much as Trump lies, I struggle to find valid reasons people support the man
Maybe you are misinformed about President Trump and his actual words. #FakeNews twists and tortures everything he says or does and spins their propaganda to fit the #LeftistSedition agenda. Sad that so many actually believe their lies and anti #AmericaFirst agenda. 
Let me tell you what's not leftist media... SDNY Attorney's Office!
Understood copy that.


It is a disgrace that our soldiers are not getting the care they need without donations.
Then there is the whole 'no need for conflict' possibility you could explore, don't sell many guns that way but people need tractors too
the strike against Syria was against international law, and I am sure the UN will blame you for it....oh, not possible because the USA have a right to veto.....good luck!
447/1226 law in America Created occupation American allies by American Jew.(Greedy-not honest Holocaust business destroy trust in relationship between allies and USA) which occupation is better Russia,Germany, Jew,or China????
Is possible that East Europe who have to pay for AmericanJews  because Germany destroyed completely their citizen property in II war, can be American allies on the future?Holocaust Business is not honest. America is going loose of the soul of honesty in society of the East Europe

Michael Cohen case shines light on Sean Hannity's property empire https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/22/michael-cohen-sean-hannity-property-real-estate-ben-carson-hud?CMP=share_btn_tw …
Rosvelt sold East Europe for Stalin in  II War. Can Trump sell East Europe to Putin instad for Russia cooperation in America -China war
Not when we trade our old allies for a new team of tyrants and dictators

No, there is more tension and distrust.
You don’t even know the difference between an ally and an adversary. —The World
Playing this way means that  today allies can be our adversaries tomorrow  has limited time for America because trust can not buy by money . It is historical process not busness. Kosher Slaughter of East and Central Europe can be awakening like in Serbia Sweden,Holocaust business
What allies?
Any specific countries in particular this is aimed at?

That's a #Fact 
So true, the best President Ever
Ally?
Turkey or Pkk/pyd
Which one is right
Turkey is a losted  ally because of  wrong policies McGurk's
Pkk pyd is a terrorist organisation
I 'm sorry Usa people do not know it
The same goes for everyday Americans.

It helps to have strong, intelligent leaders, who know how to negotiate peace. And our nation doesn't have such a leader. He wants money, fame and fortune
Guatemala is your ally in the region?

The Democrats are suing @WikiLeaks and @JulianAssange for revealing how the DNC rigged the Democratic primaries. Help us counter-sue. We've never lost a publishing case and discovery is going to be…
Absolutely. Thank you President Trump
Still the world's biggest lying hypocrite. You profit personally by weapons sales. A war profiteer. Makes money on the suffering of others. Yet evangelicals still worship you like a god. Despicable.

No matter how hard you all try, racist #45 will never be as great a man as Barack Obama. History is being written.All of the evil deeds that have been done will come to light.The truth will prevail and justice will be served to those who have committed treason!!
Someone should tell the crazy person posing as president

don't u think american service members would b better out of harms way if the people they're facing don't have guns? and what about the kids ur meant 2 b protecting?
True so true

New data shows the Trump administration has separated more than 700 children from their parents since October, including more than 100 children under the age of 4.…
. @WhiteHouse Right. Is this justification for selling arms?
Dear whitehouse pres mbeki can give trump some tips on being a humble leader and business as usual
Historically that's always worked out great!
Right up to the point where they're no longer or Allies or partners!
We've been playing that game in the Middle East for 70 years!
You'd think we'd learn!

Your allies in Africa, is Afrikaners. Equip us to defend ourselves against the genocide they threaten us with. Farm murders, land expropiation without compensation,  case in point.
Well...that is national but for me as former GovWorker, the Gov USA Trump Admin is white; but I wonder if it received my request for former Gov Pay due  to me for sick time/sick policy paid in full bfre I left office/NY Buffalo HUD due to sick later they gossip & say boss=Queen.+
Agree
Allies are ILL BEHAVED.
Take their damned toys away!

Amen to that
Amen!

I agree Mr President but it also can create a bad situation if they join together to attack us, like China and Russia.
Pee off Rusky loving Ho buying Doggies!
Oh. I see. Make the U.S. an even bigger arms dealer to the world.
Just more lies from the RCE Republican Criminal Enterprise of the United States!
What?  This doesn’t actually make sense. So when regional powers we like can be the aggressors, we don’t have to be the aggressor for them.  Is this what you meant?
BTW.. If  @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS wants our allies to buy US military equipment, it would help if it actually worked.. Aside from the absurd disaster, the F-35, our No Korea Missile Defense is a failure and our Patriot missiles can't hit a target:
If dimwit @realDonaldTrump / @POTUS wants our allies to defend themselves by buying our weapons, why did he just get a $200 Billion increase in military spending? Does he also fill up gas cans and put them on the back seat if he's only driving 2 blocks? WTF?
This also occurs when we have a reasonably intelligent person in the White House.

Yaaa Guns and weapons 
for everyone...
Make the world safe....

Praying for Mueller 
There win was electing a true American!
What a sick joke.

Until the president stops being Putin's bitch we are not safe - there is something very very wrong with this presidency
@POTUS If that's true guess you're wasting a lot of money on military.
When you supply sophisticated weapons to countries in the Middle East, they abused those weapons and use them on smaller countries. Stop supplying weapons to the Middle East so your buddies like Raytheon and you profit.
Blah blah blah!
Is that what's happening in @criminal states of @Israel & @Saudi?
America: Buy our death-dealing war toys.
It is time to take them out!
Yup, out military can use the money budgeted to finaly train and maintain. As long as a POTUS doesn't strip the funds from the military again to support a doomed to fail social program .
