フェイクニュースマスコミの攻撃にもかかわらず、

先ほどニコニコ世論調査から５４.６％という安倍内閣の支持率が出た。

ここは選挙当日、最も正確だった唯一のところだ。

いちばん外した朝日新聞、毎日新聞、東京新聞は、相変わらずだ。

クズなマスコミが多すぎる。
フェイクニュースマスコミの攻撃にもかかわらず、先ほどラスムセンから51%という支持率が出た
ここは選挙当日、最も正確だった三社のうちの一つだ
いちばん外したCNN, ABC, ワシントンポストは調査員を増員したのに…
こんな局面にも日米同盟が
North Korea kidnapped tens of Japanese people, including 13 years old girl. We really hope that the close relationship between Japan and the U.S. will retrieve all of them in the future.
いちおう訳もつけときます。
｢北朝鮮は数十人の日本人を拉致しました。その中には13歳の少女もいます。私たちは日米の緊密な関係で、彼らすべてをいつか取り戻すことを切に願っています｣
英文ありがとうございます！
世界に知ってもらうには英国です。
とても有り難い。
ありがとうございますm(_ _)m
英国でなく英語でした…(´･_･`''
You lied again. You're a disgrace. 89 indictments, 4 convictions and multiple raids say The Russian thing isn't a hoax. Dems didn't make it up. You, you're associates and family had multiple meetings with Russians during the election that all have lied about. #TrumpRussia
Shut up, Russian troll. You hate when we post truth about Trump, the Putin Puppet.
Nobody supports you. Because you are going down.

"I got the skid marks out".
Thanks. Hope you wore haz mat.
I was inoculated first.

I really appreciate your perfect splendid speech Mr President from Japan.
God bress you and our PM Abe fighting together against the fake news.
We are always with you, no fear to go anywhere u guys believe.
Or, two crooks crony-up together at the expense of the actual people of their nations.

Who wrote this tweet? There's someone left at the State Dept??
GOD I Love Our POTUS!  Thank you Dept of State for Twitting This!  Makes Me Proud. #KAG #MAGA #BlessTrump
Mr. President, Great talking points between U.S. and Japan in your speech. Please consider follow-up with North Korea transforming from nuclear-identity to what new identity. And, consider follow-up to ensure on-ground UN inspections of recent gas bomb facilities are not impeded.

Obama is already out of office. Thank God! But his Hitleresq rule has not been forgotten.
Bye bye bot boy moron.
Mr. President...you have surpassed my expectations of you.  You accomplished so much of what you promised and then some.  Much appreciation for all your hard work.  You really get results!
Imagine being Shinzo Abe & being forced to be Trump's best friend. All he wants is a good relationship with the US but what he gets is a guy plying him with endless tales about eating Arby's with Ted Nugent. Shinzo, blink twice if you need help.
We know why there aren’t any new sanctions, don’t we?
If we now have such a close friendship  make japan abide by the HAGUE!!!!

If you thought the 85,000 "cap" on H-1B (employers can use H-1B to fill U.S. jobs even when U.S. workers are available) was too high...the U.S. issued 345,262 H-1B visas in 2016. Program much bigger than widely reported (or understood by Congress). https://twitter.com/NumbersUSA/status/979818044191985664 …
Thank you, Mr. President. We Japanese will never forget your kindness and understanding

トランプ、拉致問題に言及（動画6:25〜: 前半はバーバラブッシュへの弔辞、その後 非核化）期待してマス “@StateDept: …Trump thanks PM @AbeShinzo for his support, discusses U.S.-Japan cooperation on #NorthKorea, defense, and trade, and affirms close friendship
Trust me, Trump, Abe is LAUGHING AT YOU!
Your buffoonery, your stupidity, your trashiness, your incompetence, your criminality, your allegiance to Russia, your lack of culture are all fodder for mockery!
You’re inept & corrupt.
You have no redeeming qualities.
Ich bin neugierig, was der Deal bringen wird
