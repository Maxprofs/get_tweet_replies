Why isn't the people's business conducted in the people's house or do you like spending the people's money?
More secure than the Whitehouse.
That's just crazy talk.  It's held at Mar-a-Lago  so his resort can bill the American public for it and add more tax payer dollars to Trump's pockets.  Wake up.
Once a con always a con.
You liberal lemmings make me laugh and you make me sad. So much hate for so little reason. He's not accepting his salary or his expense account, what makes you think your tax dollars are paying for this.
trumpanzees are so naive

My husband and I highly respect you Mr. Vice President!
We feel like President Trump made the right choice when picking you to be by his side! I love the fact that you aren’t ashamed to tell the world  that you are a Christian!!  May God Bless you & you’re beautiful family!
LMMFAO !

@VP #Liar-A-Loto nice this time of year is it? I bet the electricity is nice too huh? How do you people sleep at night? #PuertoRicoisDark
#HOW Does your computer work without electricity? Moron .......
Bless your heart
@VP you claim to be a Evangelical, evangelicals believe adultery is wrong, your boss has cheated on his wife more than three, and you as an Evangelical haven’t said anyhthing about. You have the audacity to call out Bill Clinton for his affairs, but can’t call out Donald Trump.
You have no idea what being an Evangelical consist of, do you?
Beautiful place ..a nice gathering  for better a relationship the world needs ..more power and God bless us all..
LMMFAO


Could have saved taxpayer money (Not tRUMP since he pays none) and had the meeting at the WH.  What are we up to?  About 100 million paid to Mar a lago so the WH swamp creatures can meet there?
The worst part is that our tax money is paying who? The Trumps org is getting our money.  Lesson one on Coorporate compliance training! So he meets at his resort (why not someone’s else?) so we pay to Mara-lago to have a gazillion people to do meet(midweek) cld hvbeen done in WH
Looks like really nice weather.
Hopefully a Storm is rolling in.....
How did Mar-a-Lago look? All the H2B workers did a nice job!! So could you please release the visas so we can all save our businesses. H2b
I heard a Stormy is coming for Florida.


100% #WINNING
So it's totally okay to bring politics into sports when it suits you, but kneeling NFL players are disrespectful?
Camp David not good enough for you two?? Having state meetings in his private hotel. No brains no ethics




You are a good man Mr Pence
Troll

She's the one who should get the lawyer.

And how much money has Trump raked in by "hosting" these events at his property?   Any ethnics or moral issues there Mr. V.P.?
Is it just me or did anyone else notice Donny's not wearing a wedding ring?  Could be a sign he's considering himself available again!
Nah, his fingers probably just got too fat for it.
Amazing how quickly President Trump is learning and oftentimes mastering diplomatic complexities. The obvious satisfaction and praise of the Prime Minister of Japan showed this. So whatever you all (POTUS, VP, FLOTUS, SECONDLADY and ALL staff) are doing, keep it up! 
LOL!  That's some funny shit!
Why are you hosting heads of state at a business owned by someone in your administration? Why are you using government funding and prestige to increase the wealth of someone who has refused to divest and end conflict of interest? You should not be proud of this.
What’s wrong with the White House? Not enough gold to your taste?
The marketing junket for @realDonaldTrump at citizen expense continues.
.@SecondLady & I were honored to join @Potus & @Flotus at Mar-a-Lago for a good day of meetings with @AbeShinzo, Mrs. Abe & the Japanese delegation. 

They wouldn’t let me play golf because Mrs Pence has to chaperone me. But I got to eat off the Good plates.
Isn’t it illegal to have this sort of thing at a Trump property?
Boss, it's bigly not nice not to mention the Russian "delegation".... daddy Vlad not happy 
Judge Moore can barely hold a candle to @realDonaldTrump when it comes to pedophilia. His defense will be that all these children are lying and he is going to sue them all. Stay tuned.
Crooks.
While you’re down there, can you tell your boss we’re tired of paying for his golf trips? BTW, when is he going to prison?
You're spending our tax dollars frivolously. Party of fiscal spending has been replaced by greedy corrupt men. #mepolitics

مش حابه اتصبح فيك .. الله لايصبحكم بخير 
Nice! 
Proud of my VP and his wife.
@SecondLady Mrs. Pence, that is a pretty blue dress, and you look lovely in it! We hope you all had a very Prosperous Day/Meeting with Japan's PM Abe Shinzo! God Bless you all!
We love you guys thank you for all you and your family do for our Nation we do love you so very much 

This is all WRONG! IT'S.......
Why don’t you do your business in Washington where it won’t cost the taxpayers extra. Oh. I forgot you don’t care about taxpayers.  Just pretend we’re fetuses.
Looks like Mar-o-Lago made some righteous cash this week.
#VoteTrumpPence2020
Any of you traitors at that dumpy Bushwood discussing the US citizens in Puerto Rico without power?
I want to make sure you know how thankful I am to know that you stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump in this critical time in American History,God Bless You & your Family Mr Vice President!
Why can’t you hold meetings at the White House?
Are you golfing too?  I love seeing tax dollars wasted.
What’s wrong with the White House?
He doesn't make any money hosting at the White House.
How many taxpayer dollars went into Trump family coffers to get your two entourages to Mar-a-Lago? Our US state residence is at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave; our nation maintains a presidential retreat at Camp David. Either option is perfect for a state visit. With good cheeseburgers.

Puerto Rico, an island made up of American citizens is without power!! Enjoy your lavish dinner.
Clara, talk to your local politians why PR has NO power. Funds were released to the  months ago!!
Manpower is needed!! For example, the National Guard would be better used helping citizens in PR than staring at Mexico.

Nice to see you came up for air from between Trumps butt cheeks long enough to get some air before diving back in with this comment.
Trump's grifting kakistocracy will b toppled. SC Mueller & NYAG Schneiderman r close. Obstruction, RICO, conspiracy, money-laundering, racketeering. Indictments dropping soon! Adding Giuliani 2 the circus is priceless!  #Muellertrainrolling #theresistance #indivisible #dotard
Yes, you are the Marie Antoinette administration saying “Let them eat cake” while Puerto Ricans are dying without electricity.  And you are Nero fiddling while Rome burns. STFU GTFOH
GOD BLESS YOU @Vp and @POTUS AND BLESS AMERICA.AMEN
  Keep making america great again  #maga#

How's the party going on the tax payer dime Mikey, ? Couldn't hold business in the White House have to wine and dine mother at the resort?? Enough, #VoteThemOut2018

Between you and me, @VP, how much did Trump charge the Japs?
How much did Trump make on this "conference"? How much did taxpayers have to pay him to have all this at Mar a Lago?
How nice! All of you got a multimillion dollar taxpayer-sponsored vacation that lined the pockets of the #TrumpCrimeFamily. If only there was someplace to meet foreign leaders that didn’t involve renting gaudy hotel rooms from the #TrumpCrimeSyndicate. #stopwastingmoney

After that big day it would be an even bigger day if you resigned
Waste of taxpayers money
The @WhiteHouse is no longer good enough for these occasions?
Lovely couple! 
We have a White House and a Camp David that are perfect for that sort of thing. And a lot cheaper. Mar-a-Lago looks like a whorehouse at the beach.
Blatant, admitted conflict of interest once again. Trump's property should not be making any money from official business of state. #corruptGOP #Impeach45 #MarALago
It was so cute the way you looked up admiringly at #Trump as he spoke. That's #RelationshipGoals right there, if my boyfriend did that and listened that well, I would love him forever.
Meanwhile, #Americans in #PuertoRico are still in the dark while you guys continue to spend #taxpayers $. #November2018
This “good” day of meetings COULD have and SHOULD have been held at the White House... not a resort setting OWNED by the criminal POTUS where he is making Money for his CORRUPT family! Think about that ...
What was for dinner? What does the PM and his wife eat. Such a classy event.

Clearly there are no other places in the United States of America to meet with dignitaries than Mar-a-Lago (all hail @realDonaldTrump).
heheheh
Why are my tax dollars spent hosting parties at trump properties??
Can't wait until this assinine regime is gone and buried in history.
You wouldn't know an "assinine regime" if it roared up and slapped you in the face! Oh wait!! It did, and repeatedly slapped you silly for 8 long years!!!
I do know and.. I also know an assinine response  About what I expect from a *Patriot*.
At least it made you laugh...
I was fortunate to view the news conference yesterday. President Trump and Mr Abe obviously have a close relationship already. I'm very impressed with President Trump. He has strong leadership/negotiation skills.
God Bless You Vice President Pence and your family. Excellent job.
You are perfect at your job: kiss Trumps ass daily, place Trump over the tenants of Christianity, 
Go on meaningless trips to perform meaningless tasks so he is not shown up, complicit yes man. Too bad your association has ruined your political career. Thoughts and prayers
Did you think to give the leftovers to the poor in the US? #supportCHIPnow

You have many active trolls, which is completely normal

Just always remember: conservatives don't generally participate in random polls or speak out in active or ugly way

It may feel you overwhelming- but we are a silent majority, and we aren't going anywhere

@realDonaldTrump

Are you getting a cut of the Mar-a-Lago profits generated from @POTUS' shameless violation of the #EmolumentsClause, hawking gear and pushing his business through his official Twitter account?

#Grifter
#ethics

Stop waisting our money and enriching Trump. You are such a coward. Thought you stood with the people. You are as treasonous to your office as Trump. #whitehouse cowards
You allow CHILDREN to be separated from parents to soothe racist and xenophobic views... kids are damaged because of your cruelty.
YAY!  More of my tax dollars spent on profiting Trump directly!
If only there was some place closer to D.C. to have meetings like this.
We have a TV host pretending to be Pres. and a radio announcer pretending to be Vice Pres. . . . and the world is watching. .
Puppet

Pissing away taxpayers money, we have a White House, the people's house to do such meetings, not Trump's private club stealing the people's money
How much did this cost us tax payers?
Yeah,  you should have joined then in DC not wasted taxpayer money at Donnys resort!!!
Why are our tax dollars going to enrich the Trump Organization? More if those great Christian and love of country VALUES? Sanctimonious Swindlers.
I love Japan and its culture, had wonderful experiences there
How about instead of wasting tax payer money and sticking it trump’s g string you hold these events at the freakin White House?
#moronparade

A vacation with Trump! How appropriate and not unexpected.
Indiana Stooge, and Least Curious VP in modern history, needs to meet with Mueller and come clean.

Melania looks super stressed and at this point would probably appreciate getting deported just to get out of the grasp of her lying, cheating husband.
Did the question come up as to why you all aren't implementing the sanctions on Russia that Congress passed all those months ago?
Who's care
Resign
We love our @VP and @SecondLady! We love our @POTUS & @FLOTUS ! Thank you for the great team you all make, as you #MAGA! Praying for you each day-so thankful for you! 
Who the Fuck is "we"?
All at our expense...
You have a beautiful wife and life partner Vice President Pence.
Did you talk directly to Jesus when you were there?
There’s so much going on here. The more I look the more I see.
So Proud and Blessed! What a Great Team ! Just make it happen! Your the Best! So many stuck in the Past ! Move Forward we the people have Faith! Amen
How about we move the meetings to a neutral site where POTUS doesn’t rake in review off tax payer money? This is the first time GOP is not going crazy over frivolously spending probably because the bottom line is their own benefit... how about we start caring about the people!
#conflictofinterest
Spending more taxpayers money at a Trump resort Comrade Pence
Disgraceful 45 profits by making his own resort his escape and profiting off of taxpayers.  Disgraceful.
Truly sad that @VP has decided to indulge in Trump personal business income by hosting our gov. business at his private property.  You getting a kickback on his new income stream?
Hi Mike!!! Keep up the good work Mr Vice President!!! MAGA!
Advertising that shit show of a club. 
#WorstPresidentEver
Second lady sure makes you look good .so proud of you two. Thanks for your service!
Great! More Tax Payers money spent at a Trump Dump! Does this clown ever stay at the WH? How many rounds of golf this time? And it’s not even the weekend!
How lovely you got to waste more taxpayer money to play golf.  Is the nation's capital not good enough???
President Trump feels comfortable in Florida! He doesn't get paid thousands of dollars to be President!
虎の威を借る狐(苦笑)
How much did the hotel charge you to stay over ?
Are you getting a cut of the taxpayer   money he's getting for these visits to Mar a Lago?
Aww haha this is sweet :p

Where you trying to assure an ally that you wouldnt also be impeached? I think thats a little premature thinking on your part mike
What would you leftists care, you wanna take Christian conservatives and throw them into death camps and loot they're possessions like your leader the Nazi collaborator George Soros did to Jews in Hungary


@WhiteHouse @SecondLady @POTUS @FLOTUS hope you and the Mrs golf or you're just not really there. You know, Like in the situation room.
Meeting where? What happened to Camp David? Was it bombed too?
Enjoy it while you can.
Mar-a-Lago looks like a dump. Were there prostitutes there?
Does this not seem wrong to you?
Another vacation.
More golf.

Sick
Yes, thank you
Another week... Another taxpayer funded vacation...

How much did that lavish dinner and golfing cost us “little people”??? My $2.00 a check tax savings is already gone. 
Is @FLOTUS the entertainment for Everyone? I hear she was good at that when @realDonaldTrump met her? He seem to like those type of women like @StormyDaniels & Karen McDougal? @VP u might like it too. Is that why ur going alone? I know ur wife wouldn't like seeing Melania's hm hm
Trump just called the Russia Probe a “hoax created by Democrats.”

— 70 Contacts

— 22 Meetings

— 13 Russians indicted

— 3 Trump advisors pled guilty

— 1 Trump advisor charged w/ conspiracy

— 1 Trump Jr met w/ Russia in Trump Tower

RUSSIA’S NOT A HOAX.
TRUMP’S PRESIDENCY IS.

Proud to call Donald J Trump my president



Cool, glad you had fun. Why does your party work to kill the sick and the poor?

Wow great picture.  Everything looks beautiful
I don’t think foreign dignitaries come to the United States to hang out with Trump at Mar-la- go. I’ve wondered how other people feel about that?
How did he manage to fit that in with all his golfing?
God is using Trump to expose fake Christian fake morals and fake patriotism Pence already sold his soul GOD don’t want it back
On a daily basis.
Glad you were able to have a wind down time this week and enjoy some well cooked meals and relaxing time with the MRs.Doing a fine job for our country sir and we thank you ...God Bless your meal and the family

When do you start to combat Bullying?

Lets start with the ones in parkland that bullied a kid for years to the point he snapped and now they are preaching gun control
Ok.. See Melania, everyone wants you to start somewhere. What's your plan #Bullying
How Tax Payer money is going to Mar-a-Lago???  #ConmanDon

Thank you sir!
thought you might enjoy that!
