Hey Jack , were you still breast feeding your child when you brought it to work with you?
Why are you still around? You haven’t been in government for 25 years! Take up knitting.
A rat's nest of Kingston Propaganda. 

Just when you thought it might be a tweet of integrity you remind yourself, "Oh! It's that Kingston guy"
Big difference between being a babysitter and providing nourishment for your child with breastfeeding.
One Kingston in a room is too many.  With the money you were pocketing from lobbyists, you could afford a damn babysitter
Define frequently, in your vernacular?
Crybaby
How many Americans not self employed are privileged enough to bring their kids to their work? Whiny Jack.
So... Ga Leg is not the US Senate  shutup
Well, Jack, when you tried to breast feed them on the house floor you kind of forced the Dems hand.
Well , it’s unprofessional jacky boy ..
“Conservatives must support”? No they don’t. They don’t have to do squat if they don’t want to...it’s a representative democracy...not a dictatorship.
Is that the best you have to offer today Trump tool?!
Frequently is not appropriate; rare cases ok. Must learn to do what all other Americans do, figure it out.  Govt is work and children belong in congressional places anymore than they do on a shop floor, classroom or office.  Since when support the nanny state! U r still SAD!
