Don't forget the $1.5 trillion price tag in deficit spending for the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct!
How much did corporations bring back, 3-4 TRILLION dollars in illegal profits, from AMERICAN jobs they moved overseas. Republicans even gave them bonus tax breaks for wealthy investors and put loan on middle-class.
OMG. To anyone who still believes this nonsense, I have a bridge for sale. The grass is orange, the sky is green. Just because you say things over and over does not make it true. And who is paying for the placement of these lies on twitter?
The American people aren’t seeing shit. Stop the GOP con! Vote them out!
Only 4% of workers are getting one time bonus.
Did y’all tell the Dow Jones ? Cause....
Wow!!  That's 4M out of a work force of 150M.  Wow!!!  4/150 --> 2.67%  Im stunned.
Bonuses are nice but meaningless in the long run.
BUBBLES ADD JOBS.

4 million Americans is an extremely small percentage of the US workers!
No Change in Paychecks

Majority of Americans not seeing change in paychecks from GOP tax cuts
NEW POLL: Majority of Americans not seeing change in paychecks from GOP tax cuts http://hill.cm/Z3NyfR3  
Funny...I'm not seeing the benefit. I just had to get a 2nd job. #GOPTaxScam #Gopcomplicit #GOPTraitors #TradeWar #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpRussia #TownHallForOurLives #TownHall #ScottPruitt #BlueWaveComing2018 #BlueTsunami2018 #November
Me too.
FACT: Hillary Clinton’s lawyer’s office was not raided today.
Such awful comparison to support this tax law. People will ask how many businesses total that only 500 use tax cut to benefit employees? People will ask comparison of invividual worker bonus vs tax cut money spent to buy back stock? SUNSET PROVISION IS DEVASTATING!
And in the time period described it will all fall down and reverse. The workers will loose everything it gave however small and start to pay the extremely rich Instead of those that need it most. YOU GUYS SHOULD QUIT BEFORE WE VOTE YOU OUT!!!!
Expand on the new benefits and bonuses. Have these companies always given bonuses? Are these new health benefits? Paid by employers?
Lots of talk, no benefits to me.

More lies
500 out of 18 million companies.  $4 billion in bonus? Who got bigger bonuses? Corporations? http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2017ar/2017ar.pdf … "The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code."  4 million feeling the benefits? Out of 126 million workers.
fake news!
Líes.
500+ companies?  $4 Billion?  4 Million Americans?
So, how many companies do you believe do biz here in #America?
More than $200 Billion in Corporate buy backs sin passage.
How many Americans in our work force?

Compare the numbers & get back to me...

Oh we’ll feel the benefits 4/15/2019-income tax.
The #GOPTaxBillScam increases the deficit, funnels $$ to the rich, piddly or nada for regular folks. Shame on the GOP.
There are 126 million full-time workers in the US.
So just 3.4% of them received some benefit
PEANUTS
Lol...temporary crumbs....pittance to the peasants and paupers,
The #GOP are seeing the results of the #GOPTaxBillScam #BlueWave2018
How about you give us a list of those 500 companies??

 Starting a Trade War with our biggest Trading Partners, which will destroy Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Transportation Jobs Nationwide.
Funny that GOP members keep harping on this point. It's like they're trying to convince us because they know the evidence we experience in our own lives has shown they're full of . @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @GOPChairwoman
Really?

Here you go: Proof of nanomachines digging through my walls. If the TV or radio was on, you'd never hear them. You need to address this immediately.
repeating a lie over and over doesn’t make it true.
You forgot the part about the deficit growth.
Save our money by not forcing us to support illegals and govt overuse of our resources for their free medical, MEDS, floods, benefit and schooling. Do Americans know we pay for school interpretators to speak to illegal parents?
FAKE NEWS!

Yes but what have u done lately? Pass the abominable  Omnibus bill?This bill among other things gives my tax $ to Democrats laundered thru Planned Parenthood. Why PPHD? Couldn’t you find another abortion provider who doesn’t launder my money to Dems?

This was a good first step but we need to make individual cuts permanent.
You're disgusting liars
Did your #taxscam help all Kmart stores? Nope they are all closing. Did your #taxscam help toys r us? Nope they are all closing as well. And this week here in NC another business closed and 50 of us are now unemployed by the end of next month. No full time jobs
Blinded American Deplorables maybe; not sensible, clear-minded, voting Americans, who are in the overwhelming majority.  See you in #VoteBlue2018 #VoteBlue2020
My taxes went up, a**holes.
Meanwhile $176 Billion went to stick buybacks to reward the 1%

4 million out of 320 million see a few crumps from #GOPTaxScam or to you want to count just the 2% of US workers?
#treasonousGOP #UnfitForOffice #MAGAMoronsAreGoverningAmerica #LyingGOP
The @GOP #TaxScamBill was just their way of saying to hell with you We are going to do what we want & stay in power

Tax breaks went Koch Brothers network of arch conservative donors to spend $400 million on the 2018 elections all to push their agenda not 

#VoteTheGOPOut
I don't believe you!
Trump and his minions lie and skew everything.  They can't be believed on anything.
Yes all this is easy to put into a tweet to make the “base” happy but what about the LOW jobs numbers for last month? What about the big hit the 401k’s have been taking because of the stock market??? Yup you guys and Trump are doing a great job! NOT!!!!!
And yet you refused to just admit the #GOPTaxScam was a massive giveaway to the rich.    You tweet to convince us you were trying to help us but you never tweet trying to convince the rich.   Because they KNOW it was for THEM.
Still waiting to benefit from the tax scam 
Start counting the many business that have closed, 
Not to mention people being laid off !!!
4 million that is a little over 1% if people in the USA , pop. 350 million  so your plan helped only 1% .. I would be fired if I produced shitty results like these! #resist #2018election
Since most Americans are against your tax scam I can see why you're still trying to sell it
#TaxScamBill
These are not great results...you are aware of that, right? Once again, the GOP has increased wealth inequality in the United States to fulfill their TREAD WATER plan for the majority of Americans.
Where they at? Can't seem to find them. Shhhh now! thanks

How many billions have been used for stock buybacks?  I recall it something like 400 B.  Most benefits are going to the richest 1%  #Trumptaxscam
@HouseGOP Republicans: It looks like teachers across America have discovered that the #TaxCutsandJObsAct has not helped the education of students. So does this mean that the @GOPrepublicans would like to literally #ThrowOutTheBabiesWithTheBathWater for a legislative win?
Yes we are seeing the result of the tax cuts....crumb and for the people. Mar-aLogo people getting massive tax cut.
