Why would you subscribe to the New Yorker in the first place? You don't sound like much of a reader.
Jack.
Ass.
No great news would be if your ass kissing is ending.
Poor Jack has nothing of substance to contribute. Just petty little jabs like our man-child President.
Of course, the NRA supplies you with more appropriate reading material.
More good news!!
Wow. You got dumped. They didn’t even make an offer to get you to stay. You’re having a bad day.
Words too Bigly?
U been ending. Jackass
Did its intelligent writing trigger you? Ps reading all the comments on everyone’s responses to all your tweets is still one of my favorite activities. It never fails.
Back to Highlights for you! (And probably a leather mag)
That’s OK you can’t read anyway.
Yes more time for you watch Fox, we know.
It’s too sophisticated for him
Oh, can't wrap your head around fact based experienced reporting!? Preference is for FAUX propaganda machine spreading disgraceful bigotry, hate and fascism that you fully embrace! It'll be nice when you're thrown out on your ear! YEA for that day!!
That's what happens when you don't pay your bills, Jack.
When you tire of the truth there’s always Sara @PressSec
I think you're just cheap.
You know you want it Jack!
Wannabe Cracker Jack admits defeat....finally realizes he is not capable of being a New Yorker. Once a Redneck Hater always a Redneck Hater.
Your really are Donald mini me
Jack, I am surprised that they would even allow you to have one.
What are you up to now ? Boy !
