On another topic: wonder why uber-rich Hannity would hire such a lousy lawyer as Michael Cohen? What do you think, #DisingenuousJack?

Well Jack Hannity is now exposed.  Hope you haven't had any real estate dealings with Michael Cohen. He seems to be the attorney of choice of the Republican Party.
Oh do they Jack?  Do you get paid by the letter?
@seanhannity is caught up in this Cohen raid circus!!!!
