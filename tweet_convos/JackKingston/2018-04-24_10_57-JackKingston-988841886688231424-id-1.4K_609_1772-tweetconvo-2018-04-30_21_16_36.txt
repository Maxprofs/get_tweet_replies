Not at all interested in what Comey has to say.
Trumpies are not interested in many things, that's true
trumpies are not interested in many things that are true.
I’ll make it clear I’m not interested in what either of you have to say. Try saying something intelligent. Name calling is getting old.....
it is apparent that you are not interested in opposing opinions. what is sad is that those opinions are based upon facts whereas your opinions are based upon wishful thinking.
Opposing Opinions LMAO you mean I don’t agree with you so I’m wrong. I don’t let anyone tell me how I should think, sorry you got caught up in all that brainwashing. Please go on now enjoy your day, you obviously need to have fun.
You can’t spell correctly in a three word tweet.
Pretty sure he meant it that way......
#DrainTheSwamp #MAGA #Trump2020

Can u trust the Times Best Seller list when they won't put conservative books on it?
Giggle worthy...they call it the "best seller" list.  Is it that difficult to understand the reason conservative books don't reach it?  There is a gap between the number of conservatives and the majority...you are in what is called the minority, by more than a little.
Plus most conservatives don’t really like books
Reading is fundamental.
Our POTUS doesn't read.  Daily briefings went from long and thorough (he lost interest), shorter hoping to catch his interest (didn't work), bullet points (too many) to just plain not listening because his focus is himself. Narcissism at its best.
Yes, there was nothing *about* him in them...I'm sure he was shocked.
who the hell buy lies? I wouldn’t touch for free. His time will come
You buy Trumps lies, no?
Good one

Idiot. 

If your god-king #Trump hadn't bragged to his Russian handlers that he fired #Comey to stop the #Collusion investigation,  we would have never had a Special Counsel.  

Trump is the worst most corrupt President in American history. 

Also the stupidest.
You're still talking of Trump / Russia collusion yeah?  You know it's 2018 right?
You're still talking about Clinton and Comey who aren't even in the government anymore! Sad!
Yeah Comey has literally just released a book, a failed book at that, so warrants discussion... & until Hillary is in prison or this stupid counsel is shutdown she will be relevant too! It's that simple! Have you anything worthwhile to say?
A "failed" book that sold 600k copies in one week. LOL!
Failed asin credibility, ofcourse! He's just cancelled his book tour. There is no demand for more lies & I think @LauraLoomer scared the shit out of his team so the plug has been pulled on that! It was always going to be an earner, it's America/Trump! People are crazy for that!
Lol, there is nothing in the book that has been discredited. In fact, it's been corroborated by pretty much everyone involved (except Trump of course.) But don't worry, I'm sure it's just a massive, government-wide conspiracy against Trump! Couldn't possibly be that he's corrupt.


He’s going to need all that cash for his legal fees.
Wow ,, very greedy of him to sell more books than the others sir !! This is not what the Bible teach’s us !!!
Sean Hannity = Welfare Queen
The Real cash Grab #FireHannnity
#WelfareQueen #SeanHannity
Well fiction often does well.
At least he produced a book. You're just a #welfarequeen
He'll need it for his Lawyers!
AGREED his book is "comedy". 

Because too much $$$$$ goes to other foolishness like supporting illegal immigration
Keep in mind, Trump only signed it cause it will benefit him & all his Fox News friends. Including Hannity now that we know used 20 shell corporations to buy all that real estate using government help 
Ok............

“Sean Hannity’s real estate venture bought houses thru a property dealer who was involved in a criminal conspiracy to fraudulently obtain foreclosed homes.”

…
To all TRUMPSTERS - Go to @MichaelAvenatti Twitter page to get copies of ALL COURT TRANSCRIPTS!  REAL NEWS that @seanhannity DOESN'T WANT U @ READ!
You are in no position to make judgement on anyone.  870 homes?

You’re a lying thief who abused a government system to help the under privileged.  Deplorable isn’t even close. 

Welfare Queen. 

@FoxNews
Sean, are you still in touch with Julian Assange since they took his wifi away?  "The head of Wikileaks told @SeanHannity__ to seek ‘other  channels’ for information on Sen. Mark Warner of the Trump-Russia  investigation..."
WikiLeaks is Russian agitprop and Assange is a Russian operative.
yep. and Assange is apparently also a source of information for Sean Hannity.    Russia=>WikiLeaks=>Hannity.      Ironic that so many of Sean's fans are conspiracy theorists, but they are missing this great big REAL conspiracy that Sean Hannity is involved in.  #ComradeHannity

CONGRATULATIONS on making it to the TOP of the BEST SELLER LIST Comey! Thanks for Tweeting this Hannity!
Some people write and sell books others become secret slumlords
Welfare Queen Hannity at least he didn't get money from HUD
#hannitysHUDcashGrab  at least selling books is a legal way to make $$, unlike #handOutHannity
Why shouldn't he get paid for a best selling book?
He was fired and now he's an author. It's the great American comeback story. How about Hannity using HUD money for property when the fucker is already rich? You're ok with that people? Look up Hannity and his dirty deals.
New song for you; set to the melody of "Dancing Queen" only we're gonna call it "Welfare Queen"

#republicanthings
Welfare Queen
Said the guy that bagged on #Obama about housing crash (Bush created by the way) and then took advantage of #HUD and borrowed millions at the expense of people who lost their homes. Great guy!!! Not!!! #FireHannity #Hannity #GOPTaxScam #NeverTrump #JimmyKimmel #TheResistance
Joseph Goebbels, Cash Grab? You'd think he used  Millions of Dollars  in #HUD loans to buy property. James Comey wrote a compelling book about himself & about his involvement in matters of national importance. That book is a national treasure, not a cash grab.
Looks like your boyfriend firing Comey kinda backfired a bit. 
Hopefully he is digging his own demise, because there are holes in his story and untruth to his book
I know exactly what you mean.

It seems people of power are not held accountable for anything.
Cash grab? Like shady real estate loans/dealings with HUD and a venture linked to fraudulent property dealer, Jeff Brock? You mean like that?
You're the wrong person to talk about a cash grab. How much HUD money did you get to create your welfare queen empire? And how much gov't help did you get flipping them as condos for a higher profit?
There are two things I don't like about you - your face.
It must annoy you immensely when someone gets rich for telling the truth.  It's like upside down world for you I'd imagine. #HandoutHannity #WelfareQueenHannity
Jealous much?
@seanhannity HUD CASH GRAB!
#SeanHannityHudCashGrab
The irony: Hannity making $36 million / year as a dishonest media personality who spouts off for hours every day is mad at Comey for selling a book about his own life, recollections, and opinions.
Hannity the welfare Queen

BEST. VIDEO. YOU'LL. SEE TODAY. 

Melania did NOT want to Trump's hand.


Bot 63658486 has been recalled back to Macedonia. We apologize for the inconvenience.
Get a Life Sean your cashing in on low income housing.
What do you mean by Comedy's Cash Grab? This means your tweet says: "COMEDY IS CASH GRAB". Do you sometimes feel like an IDIOT Hannity? Just a question. BY THE WAY: you going to get MICHAEL AVENATTI on your show Hannity? Or does he SCARE you baby? Just a question.
YOU'RE A POS WELFARE QUEEN!!
You have some nerve talking about a cash grab, welfare queen. I hope they put you in jail for this one.
Love Comey and Comey's book.
Isn't profit from a crime or criminal activity illegal? Son of Sam law?
Slumlord Hannity and Carson of HUD needs to be investigated. TV time for millions of increase Gov’t back loans! Jail time. @FoxNews @HUDgov
Sean. Come on. James Comey is not disgraced. That’s a ludicrous thing to say.
That’s OK he’ll need it to pay his over priced defense attorney/ dream team.
It's not the same as you taking advantage of the poor and the government. #Hypocrisy is rampant.
Yes, it's much better to let forclosed houses sit empty and ruin surrounding home values. For shame, Sean. Stop buying foreclosures! Let those neighborhood values decline!
You missed the point. Sean has a history of hypocrisy. He is for smaller government but takes advantage of HUD loans. He also got an increase of $5 million recently and never mentioned it when he had Ben Carson on his show. He says one thing but does another.
#Democrats Garbage ...
 You'll be in the movie, The Wall. Rachael @maddow will make room for you, as you try to climb back up w/o a get out of jail free card (pardon). Obstruction, corruption, deduction, right-offs... low rent real estate deals with shell co, that you own! 
Sean Hannity, as long as we are discussing "Cash Grabs" lets talk about those HUD DEALS you have been getting. You like Foreclosures huh? How many millions have you laundered my dear? Time Will Tell.....Tick Tock 

And what of your cash grab??
Listen , I wouldn’t be calling anyone else disgraced. You have disgraced our airwaves. You who has no problem making insulting remarks about the poor yet gets loans through HUD to buy houses! SlumLord #AmericasWelfareQueen #FuckHannity
As opposed to Hannity's Cash Grab, which puts Comey's to shame for being so puny. You are known by the company you keep:
Oh, Sean, Sean, Sean...the only one grabbing cash, and from HUD no less, is YOU. You lying, pandering hack. #WelfareQueen #IfTheShoeFits #FireHannity
He’ll need the money for his legal defense
So Hannity was working with a convicted criminal to purchase foreclosed homes?   Wow, Welfare Queen Hannity is in some trouble now.
America's advice to Comey enjoy your new fame and under no circumstances should you spend any of the money you've made from your ( BS. Book ) your going to need it for all the lawyers that you will be retaining for the coming years FOR "YOUR CORRUPTION"
you are one to talk

Hannity, you misspelled in a three word tweet man. Are you nervous about something????
He's going to need all that money for his gofundme legal defense
You're fleecing hud college dropout. At least comey isn't corrupt.
*comedy
Looks like you should be thanking Obama for the welfare.

Comedy? Ok. Here’s a joke. Did you lose your house in the financial crisis? Sean found it.
He will need it for legal fees.  Candace Owens is so right. Brainwashed fools!
He looks like a very uncomfortable Giraffe in an ill-fitting WalMart Suit.

#GrrAnimals 
#GrrrGraphics
@GrrrGraphics
Bashes Trump but doesn't mind making money at his expense.  So many money grabbers these days writing books at Trump's expense and profiting.  MAKES ME SICK!
Helppay his legal fees.
Look who else is cashing in...
I "almost" feel sorry for her......
He should of just grabbed cash from government loans like #HandOutHannity.

I thought there was a law against criminals profiting from their crimes by writing a book?
Um..you spelled "irony," wrong, Mr Ed.  You're welcome.
#HandoutHannity knows cash grabs
 #welfarequeenhannity #WelfareQueen  is talking like his  don’t stink #HandoutHannity biggest taxpayer subsidized land grab, during housing crisis, maybe ever!
Lying (legally) to the American people since 2004...
LIE MUCH HANNITY?
#CohenFlipped 
 
#Hannity #maga
I guess it doesn't come near your money grabbing buying houses in foreclosure :-))))
He'll soon need the money for a good attorney
Doesn’t even compare to your cash grab of hud
Time for #WelfareQueen to trend
He should have hired Cohen to set up a shell corp to funnel the money thru, right Sean?
coming from #SlumLordHannity

He'll need the money to pay for the protection he'll need in prison.
Ouch 
The guy is a worm...my only regret is not being able to tell him to his face. I’ve worked with and worked for many people like him, and watched how they went down in flames  I will take some satisfaction knowing he spent all his book money on legal defense
You and @realDonaldTrump share dictionaries don’t you?
Crooked comey sells his fiction fairy tale book. Next book? Lying got me nowhere, I was wrong, got me here.   
Well I guess criminals need to make money also, and he’ll need it to keep his ass out of jail.
Hey Sean. Question for u. How many NDA’s did Cohen do for u? Tick Tock
Lets hope his hubris puts him in the big house, turning big rocks into little rocks.
I corrected the title 
Proof that weak-minded idiots exist...
Sir, you don’t get to call people out on cash grabs. Not this week at least until we get this rather untidy business about how you’re financing your real estate through FHA loans sorted out.
Might be outselling Hilley's book but I do not believe publisher going for reprints. Fake news.
Aren’t you involved in some real estate cash grabbing?
Comey's hilarious comedy cash grab?
At least he isn`t grabbing it from HUD like you, welfare queen.
His money will never get the respect back he once had. No good will his money bring him

Says the up to my nose in shell companies buying foreclosed real estate. You’re just jealous. Sold more books in a day you ever did.
Will provide him a nice allowance in Leavenworth!
You’re the one to talk about a CASH GRAB. Lol. #HannityWelfareQueen
The only thing that is “disgraced” around here is you, Sean.
A bestseller because Americans are sick of the fallacies coming from Trump’s ignorance. He has honed the art of the lie since he was a teen. His father was aware of it as were his teachers. And you are making a farce of yourself supporting him. Why?
He'll be in the "remainders" bin, soon...watch and see.
Wow, you're bashing everyone today...it is because you're trying to deflect from the HUD scandal...hmmm? #WelfareQueenHannity
I don’t think criminals should profit from selling their stories!
He will need the money
#LockHimUpAlready
He should’ve been a slumlord. More honorable profession than author eh?
Thrash about all you want but you’re in the net and you’re about to be pulled into the boat.
Comey’s book is selling because 1. The FBI Director would usually tell the truth 2. We  all knew Hillary is a liar 3. People who hate @POTUS want to read some dirt. #sad #hypocrites #DrainingTheSwamp
Million dollar retainer and that's just the beginning of the Attorney scalping party. After a potential Fed prison stint, he might be fortunate enough to live in a 63 Volkswagen van with camping luxuries. He might write his My Time in The Fed Joint book.
Shame Shammity Cashes in....with the help of HUD!! Welfare Queen!
Sean Hannity got favoritism from Ben Carson.  HUD gave Hannity Mega Dollar loans so he could cash in on others misfortune.  Hannity is a WEASEL.
He’s going to need that money for his upcoming @Comey legal fees
Would never read that garbage...
That’s great! He will need as much of a criminal defense fund as possible. Though I’m not sure it will be anywhere near enough to cover for his distinguished public service of monetizing crime. #CashStrappedComey
@HUDgov loan guarantees!!!! $17M!!! Cash grabbing Hannity!!!
He makes money off of a book, you make money off of government loans for the poor, who's worse? Learn how to spell.
LEAVE HIM ALONE!! HE IS RAISING CASH FOR HIS CASE N TO LEAVE FUNDS FOR HIS FAMILY WHEN HE GETS 15 TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR TREASONOUS ACTS!
Sit back @seanhannity is going to give a lecture on “cash grab”, free attorney advice and real estate
Disgrace to America
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @MSNBC @foxandfriends 

1. Please don’t pick on Hannity for spelling he is a college dropout and poorly educated.

2. Why are you dissing an American citizen following the American dream. I thought conservatives loved the idea if capitalism. 2faced ad always
Also outselling anything written by @seanhannity
At least he's not a welfare queen like you.

Yeah but YOU are the punch line!
#WelfareQueenHannity 
#TrumpLies
BEWARE of any BUYER.
So Sean seems new news out about your #WelfareQueenHannity actions and dealings. Care to explain.
Sean Hannity is so desperate to destroy Hillary Clinton he's reduced to using Comey's success to do it.
Are you jealous, Sean?
He is going to need every nickle for his DEFENSE FUND!
How embarrassing.  And to think of the position he held - astonishing.
You have no room to talk about what anyone else is doing to make money #WelfareQueenHannity
Who bought it, 100,000 to the Soros foundation, 100,000 to the Obama library (the only books will be Obama biographies and Comey book), 100,000 to ...
...said the bottom of the cracker barrel HUD-felon as he prepares for his new gig as Leavenworth’s #1 butt-monkey.

Bend over and say AAGGHH tough guy...
Book Flop! Read American Bill of Rights instead!
https://membership.nrahq.org/forms/signup.asp?campaignid=XP032234 …
Hopefully it'll all be spent on legal fees.... (SOON)..
So says the Welfare Queen.

And what about your CASH GRAB courtesy of HUD OEOPLEXWHO LIVE IN Glass houses shouldn’t throw rocks TICK TOCK
Is that anything like a welfare cash grab Sean? @Comey @CNN @nytimes @FoxNews
Hannity you are such a disgrace. Just like your true friend DT. Avenatti is coming for you and he is bringing Karma with him. You know Karma not so?
Leaky Comey has not served Americans well
Get fucked
Yeah whatever welfare queen!
Listen to the welfare queen speak about grifting. Sean how many low income folks yoj screw out of buying a home because you took 5 million from hud for low income buyers. Dont you make 40 million a year. Shame on you
Why are you giving him free press on this???
That's because all the people Comey is holding dirt on, are buying big lots of his book to keep him from giving them up.
Hating on Comey for selling a book? How many have you sold? LOL
You know how you manipulated your friendship with certain officials to get HUD backed loans meant for low-income housing development? 

Retire. Before you are destroyed.
Give me mein kampf over that crap
All for the optics. 
How many copies did Soros buy to ensure "best seller" bragging rights?
Oh, Comey sold 4 books? Hillary sold 1 to Bill, 1 to Chelsea and 1 to Barack!

Ok, I guess they are tied now.
Comey is Projected to break $1000 by August, Hillary once again may not break that Glass Ceiling until 2020...
He'll need all that money for his legal fund...
Not a "buying up millions in foreclosed real estate"-style cash grab... but sure...

Ufda. Somebody's pissed Comey's book is outselling any of the trash he's ever written.

Comey's time is up.... the TRUTH will be told....

#QAnon #WWG1WGA
If Comey is comedy, it's not funny.
That's a great line @seanhannity

Comey, the kingpin behind "operation insurance policy" an active measure plot to frame a sitting president with a felony crime, collusion, for a single goal-the total annilation of freedom-indict now with one count of treason on steroids ...@realDonaldTrump  @CNN @nytimes @ABC
One for the $$ two for the show three for HUD ,Hannity must go 
His name is Comey, Client #3!
If only Comey made his money flipping distressed mortgages with HUD loans, but NOOOO, he had to write a book.
Comey is telling the truth. Those that haven’t believed before ,after reading his book, do now. Being Consistent,including the memos that back it up, That’s a sign of honesty ,not changing the story 100. times as ppl learn the truth. Like you and tRump.
YOU ARE THE COMEDY... You come nowhere close to even an iota or the smallest particle in existence to @Comey  when it comes to integrity....
