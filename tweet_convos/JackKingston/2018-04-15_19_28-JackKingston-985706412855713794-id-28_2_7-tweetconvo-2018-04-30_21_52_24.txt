Big surprise!

Jack Kingston didn't read the book.

Everyone just dismiss what this comrade tweets.
You quote "mulligan"? Really? After the right wing evangelicals give @realDonaldTrump "mulligans" for his marital infidelity? That's too much. Even for you.
Habitual liar vs Comey
But then again, it reflects an equally vengeful bleak representation of this presidency, doesn't it?
Have you read the book through or are theses your observations from @FoxNews ?
Oh Jack, maybe you need to get on medical marijuana.
Kiss a rattlesnake in the mouth
Aren’t you a good little sycophant for the @GOP?  You’re on the wrong side of history.
Jack Kingston is really nuts
No only Trump gets that
Yep!  Trump deserves payback!!!!
But not untrue. What Comey has said on the record is spot on. Should he have written the book? There’re cogent arguments against it.
Oh Jack...bless your heart...
Man shut up and go press the front of Trumps trousers. Let's let the true  Americans speak tonight.
If not for that you wouldn't be a sycophant to your president.
Are you pacing back and forth? Nervous. Angry that beans are being spilled? #Nevertrump
People have gotten mulligans for worse.
Are sitting on Hannity’s lap while you tweet? You two nimrods are tweeting the same garbage.
Spelled unprofessional wrong seriously?
People know that nothing viable comes out of your thought and  opinion. A good reason why your tweet doesn't get that attention, comments & retweets. Its garbage and trash.
Jack you're trying way too hard here - you should really give it up before you embarrass yourself any more, if that is possible!

Have you read it?
