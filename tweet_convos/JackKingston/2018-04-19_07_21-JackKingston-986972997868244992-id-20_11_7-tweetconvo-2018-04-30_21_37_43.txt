When asked whether #MichaelCohen could handle prison, @realDonaldTrump former attorney says, "Prison has certain racial overtones and I don't see Michael Cohen walking down Broadway while someone asks him to be his wife." Did I just dream this moment? Wow
FU jack

Righties play all the time, right Jackie!

Rand Paul is Republican you stable genius
Give it up Jack. With the Dems and  Obama’s and Clinton’s. Your own party can’t say if they would support the chameleons re-election.
The only Chicken Shit in the house is you! Go Cluck some other place!
Not as a high of stake with having him as SOS with Trump as POTUS and Equally hawkish NSA person. W/out current POTUS would be tolerable.
Consequences being Trump & GOP congress eliminate elections? Cohen has ties to Ukrainian/Russian mobsters, Pruitt continues his corruption, Trump continues lying, McConnell going to allow Trump to fire Mueller!! America will vote - if allowed to - and toss you SOBs out!

If you can’t keep all the butt kissers in your party on his side that’s not a good sign
Bring it ON
SHUT UP FOOL!!!!!!!!!
