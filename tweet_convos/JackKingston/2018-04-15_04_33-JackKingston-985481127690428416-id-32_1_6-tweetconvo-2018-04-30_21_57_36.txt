Errr...no, I don’t see any facts that show Comey is a liar. And, that’s not a partisan comment b/c I’m a Republican. Sorry, Mr. Kingston but your attempt to spin this is just not working.
Jack i think you might be the most unpopular person on twitter. Also ETTD
STOP hating... @realDonaldTrump lies over 2G You don't see us whiney JUST SAYING
You are so fucking full of shit!
Jack, aren’t you being rather selective in your identification of those who lie and twist the truth? It certainly seems hypocritical for you to ignore the same behavior in those with whom you politically agree.
Trump is the "Me first"!!!!
Conservatives show their true values through the actions of thugs like Matt Bevin as they toss America's next generations under the bus of their idiot-ology. Crowded classrooms, out of date books, underpaid teachers. Voting conservative is a vote to end American values.
We know he is telling the truth
....them self's like @PressSec I guarantee they don't feel the same way as the president they can say they do all they want but they're only saying that to keep their jobs because they know if they speak their mind they will be fired and I would rather be fired and work for him
The only one that wants to bad mouth #comey is @realDonaldTrump and why is that that's because #comey knows all about @realDonaldTrump secrets and that's why he is trying to discredit him everyone at the white house says what Trump tells them to say they can't ever think for...
A Higher Royalty is the new title. It’s stormin’ through the best sellers, until Cohen’s comes out
It's like looking in a mirror isn't it Kingston Propaganda.
One exception is that you're a sack of irrelevant commentary.
No get 'em seat at the grown ups table Jacko.
@POTUS @SenateGOP @Morning_Joe @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @paladine HEY SPANKY WHAT ABOUT YOU AND STORMY LMAO
You were an embarrassment this morning. Blackwell can't hold his laughter anymore.
Jack the Cracker, so by your logic, @realDonaldTrump is a HUGE liar, right?
Really, Jack? Comey just calls it as he sees it.. seems fair to me..
@JackKingston So, @realDonaldTrump has lied well over 2000 times since being in office. @JackKingston you lie every time you appear on tv. Why do you suddenly care about lying?
@JackKingston @GOP @realDonaldTrump When did the GOP get so concerned about lying?
Then why are they trying so hard to brand him as a liar? We KNOW he is not a liar, we know that Trump and his enablers (including you) are pathological liars. We also know you are helping Comey sell his book, and not smart enough to stop talking about it. Keep talking.
When someone such as yourself paints Comey's book as lies, most people are inclined to believe it more. That is how little credibility you have at this point. Choosing to support a pathological liar, such as Trump has consequences.
Jack if facts  Spoke  for themselves Trump would be in jail. Unless of course you're talking alternative facts And then you guys are King
Today students, we find that taking Lickspittle Jack's hashtags, and multiplying them by 100 gives us a product equivalent to @realDonaldTrump
The American people will choose who is the more truthful and honorable man, although flawed as we all are. By the way your no help to the president. You come off as a jester.

Ditto Jack.
Facts do speak for themselves which is why it's amazing you're still lying about Comey!
The facts do speak for themselves!!
