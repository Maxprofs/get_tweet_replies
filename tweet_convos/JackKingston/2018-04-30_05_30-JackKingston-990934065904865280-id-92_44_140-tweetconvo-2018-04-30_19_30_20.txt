Trumpocrisy in this Trumpocracy! #VoteThemOut
Tell this to the poor fired chaplain. @Pontifex @GOP  Shame on you GOP!
Watch the Senate GOP misrepresent who is really benefiting from tax reform, and how much. Watch as they give to their donors, and tell you how it benefits you. These are the people who would take healthcare from millions, who could have crafted a fair tax plan, but didn’t.
#CorruptCongress TAKE HEED!
Say what you want, folks, it won’t be long before voters realize what a Ponzi scheme your #TaxSCAM REALLY IS & how most of the $1.5TRILLION hole you blew in the national debt is being used to pay for more jets, mansions & yachts for 1%ers & corporate execs!
It’s not working for hard working families. #GOPTaxScam
Umm, no it’s not- it’s paying off for your corporate masters..
It isn't helping this constituent very much. Cost of living going up. Gasoline 10 cents higher. Groceries higher. Tax cut added $40/month. Bet the 1% loves it though.
Working for the Swamp #goptaxscram
Not helping me, and then there's the whole TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THING my kids are going to be saddled with. But I am sure the rich and corporations are thankful to you Aholes.

It's a scam.  I'm still broke.
BS

Goodbye Middle Class GOP has TAKEN EVERYTHING FROM YOU!!! #GOPTaxScam
Not in Arizona our Educational system is paying high prices.  49th in the nation for teacher pay.. #RedForEd
Lies
Yaaawwwn, here we go again. No one’s buying the #GOPTaxscam you’re pathetically trying to sell. Stop #gaslightingAmerica w/ fascistic propaganda, disinformation & demonizing the media. #GOPCorruption #GOPComplicit
Pathological liars and propaganda for a criminal enterprise in the White House ! No minimum wage changes , trump products still being made in China .
You mean the top 1% and corporations. Certainly nit the middle class
It's sure working for your billionaire donors.

Tell America how much @POTUS @GOP and their cronies are making millions from tax cuts then how your constituents make 2 cents more an hour.
As one of their constituents,  I can assure you it's not doing much. #unimpressed
8 journalists were murdered in Kabul, Afganistan, today, for doing their jobs.
The #GrandOldPervs have lied every step of the way about their #TaxSCAM & conspired with the #FauxPOTUS to authorize the #LootingOfAmerica.  No matter, come November #WeThePeople will be taking corrective measures.  Dust off your resumes...
#VoteThemOut
No ILLUSION 
#trumprussia 
It is working. Working to drive up public debt.  The deficit is rising again after falling under Obama. It’s projected to be larger than its ever been in the history of the USA.  83% of benefits go to the upper class.
We would like to hear how it is helping them and Trump.
THANKS GOP
If it was working so well they wouldn’t still be harping on about it like 3 year olds who made poop in the potty 4 months ago
Again, repetition does not create truth.  The tax cuts are primarily going to the corporations, who are NOT spending most of it on employees, and the top 1%,, who I couldn't care less about.  All with the price tag of 1.5 T.  You think that's a win???
Lies, talk to any CPA to learn the real truth. Elected Republicans are the greatest terrorist threat this country faces. November can’t come fast enough, vote these thugs out before we lose our country.
Rubio says otherwise

Hey when do you start talking about the #Deficit again? I guess you waiting for Dems to take over so you can start talking about how their "entitlement programs" (you know school lunches for poor kids) are killing the debt - but not "farm subsidies" or "military spending".....

#Taxscam lets hear about the millions of those that don't need it

Explain this for me.  How is doing what you always do constitute reform.
...for the rich!
What are you people on? Taking those pharma drugs yourselves now? Are they free for you and your fam?
Lying, as usual.
My tax cut completely consumed by oil companies.   Looking at a net loss this year
How about the constituents they refuse to meet with and have arrested for trying to get a sit down with their representatives?
Tax break permanent for the rich. But middle class go down each year for ten years finally to a negative during the last year of the ten.
Less than 4.5% of Americans got a one time bonus.  Where’s the increase in minimum wage, overtime, safe working conditions, family leave, healthcare benefits?  No, you decided it was best to give everything to the rich; crumbs to workers.
Take a look as members of the @SenateGOP talk about how they all got large Super PAC gifts from the Kochs,Mercers et al for the Trump Tax Scam.
Banks have made huge profits from the Trump-GOP #TaxReform, lining the pockets of CEOs and shareholders, contributing little to economic growth, and trickling only a few percent down to workers. And now banks can buy even more political power in Congress
If the only news source you’re quoting is #FauxNews you’ve already failed and companies which buy back their stock w/o providing living wages & benefits only helps corporations. Co’s which fail to adhere to previously stringent EPA & banking regs also FAIL Americans #NoMoreLies
Where?
all except that RINO Collins, who is out of control
STOP LYING!!!

You can only underestimate your constituents for so long.
They seem to understand the game this time.
Why continue the con?
#Buck50 for me and millions for @SenateGOP

That's NOT what 99% call working for them. 

#RepealAndReplaceGOP The BlueWave is coming.
Where exactly is GOP congress on fixing border issues such as "catch and release"?  What the hell are you waiting on? This is priority #1!!!


It's working for the RICH & the CORPS ONLY!!!!!!!!
Hey y’all motherfuckers better not let the Democrats win dammit I better see y’all out there shaking hands and knocking on doors.I want that $2000 tax credit for each of my kids better not let the Democrats win. Y’all better campaign like y’all’s lives depend on it
Lying @GOP! What 95% of working Americans will remember come Nov is the sham of a tax 'reform' pushed by @GOP & @realDonaldTrump: it's criminal to give a temporary 2% cut to working Americans while giving a permanent 14% cut to corporations so that can pay their CEOs $7,000/hr!
Hey- DO YOUR JOB!
what world do you live in?  Gas prices are going up-over .20 per gallon here.  Food, plants and even dirt( over 2.00 a bag).  In my world there was no Tax cut.  Republican Tax cut is a joke.
Dictator Donald Tyrant Trump and the basket of deplorable Banana Republican cheats must stop lying to the people. The tax cuts are for the rich, not the middle-class. Can you say DEFICIT.
Daily Repugnican lies and bullshit!
No they are not working. Still a tax scam.
Ya for Billionaires...you scumbag traitors.
The #GOPTaxScam is working for the rich.    Don’t buy the BS about it working for all.   The deficit alone is reason to hate the bill.   Eventually we will have to deal with that and they sure as heck aren’t going to raise taxes on the rich to pay for it.

I lie, repeated, becomes increasingly insulting, not increasingly true.


http://talk.is.cheap .  the tax reform isn't.
