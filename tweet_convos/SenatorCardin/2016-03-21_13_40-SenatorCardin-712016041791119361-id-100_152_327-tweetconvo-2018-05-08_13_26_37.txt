@SenatorReid where were all these #DoYourJob people when Senator Reid neglected to pass a budget?
@pandard66 @SenatorReid couldn't pass a budget b/c of the @Senate_GOPs obstruction. They need to be held accountable.
@benintn @SenatorReid @Senate_GOPs never even introduced a budget. "obstruction" wasn't issue. didn't bring 1 even when had super majority
@pandard66 read this
@benintn what about the 5 years prior to 2013?
@pandard66 tea party and GOP blocked Senate. But budget resolution is only a place holder. Senate just used President's budget to start.
@benintn read the articles. what happened in the years prior to TP take over?
. @SenatorReid Has @NinaTotenberg spent much time conferring w/ you & @SenatorLeahy on oppo research on Garland?  #OhWaitHesADemocratNominee

@SenatorReid Your tirades are only 4 the #DEMENTED, Harry.  Nobody really listens to your ramblings!
@SenatorReid Mr Reid, pay by the same rules you've played before you worn out liberal politician. Give it a break.
@SenatorReid
@SenatorReid Still upset with Chuck Todd for masterfully exposing your hypocrisy on this matter?  !992-Biden rule-2006 Alito filibuster.
@SenatorReid I don't usually agree with you but regarding #SCOTUS I 100% agree #DoYourJob McConnell s/b embarrassed
@SenatorReid you've been in power to long Reid the millennial vote is coming for you
@SenatorReid You are in no position to tell anyone to do their job in that you have been grossly derelict in the performance of yours.
@SenatorReid #DoYourJob and get a viable immigration reform bill passed.
@SenatorReid An Act of Congress can only be repealed (invalidated) by congress which means DOMA is valid law. #DoYourJob and defend it.
@SenatorReid #DoYourJob before concerning yourself with whether or not someone else does theirs.
@SenatorReid Legislators legislate; courts adjudicate in accordance with enacted legislation. #DoYourJob and uphold the US Constitution.
@SenatorReid you do not #DoYourJob anytime you allow the court to legislate in violation of the US Constitution.
@SenatorReid you did not #DoYourJob and rebuke the court when it used a court decision as though it was legislation to persecute Kim Davis.
@SenatorReid did not do his job when the court presumed to amend the US Constitution conferring person rights on corporations #DoYourJob
@SenatorReid You don't a damn thing about doing your job or the Senate wound have passed a budget while you were Sen Leader
@SenatorReid Americans raise your voice & tell congress to observe the Biden rule and not appoint a justice during an election season.
@SenatorReid Senator Reid, you are one of the most corrupt people in DC AND you are a disgrace to your chosen faith.  Go suck rocks.
@SenatorReid You are obviously not a student of the constitution. The President may appoint and the Senate may approve.
@SenatorReid Hypocrite
@SenatorReid have the democrats put ppl up to these demonstrations to take the press off of the president shaming us in Cuba ???
@SenatorReid How can you TELL ANYONE TO DO THEIR JOB?  You have never done yours unless lying and stealing is your job, pant load.....
@SenatorReid we just wonder how much the democrats paid for the protest on woman said she got $150 so who knows what the dems are up to ?
@SenatorReid Amazing you telling Republicans to do their job. You never did yours and still don't. You cost the Dems both houses of Cong.

@SenatorReid What about blocking the vote twice on Kates Law??? What about Grant Ronnebeck and Sarah Root?? Do they not matter???
@SenatorReid A chance for a lame duck president to make SCOTUS nomination in last year only happened once in the past century: 1968.
@SenatorReid I called, and said, "Block him, filibuster him."
@SenatorReid What about Alito? You are the biggest enemy of the American people.
@SenatorReid thanks for the #RobertsStandard.
@SenatorReid how many days has it been for @POTUS (2) #DoYourJob
@SenatorReid does @POTUS stand w #FlintWaterCrisis stop the food fight & solve problems. Bush had action in 4 days and got criticism (1)
@SenatorReid how about you do your job, which has nothing to do with predicting the eventual winner of the Dem presidential nomination?
@SenatorReid how about apologizing to Dem voters in the states still to vote/caucus for declaring Hillary the nominee before they've voted.
@SenatorReid I only heard rumblings about today's "Day of Action" and I've been very vocal about demanding a hearing. Notify your base.
@SenatorReid So was it a secret campaign? Seriously, Dems get your act together & activate your base better than that! Wasserman needs out!
@SenatorReid The Biden Rule should apply. Here's Biden Rule set in 1992.
@SenatorReid What voices? Schumer, Hillary, Obama?
