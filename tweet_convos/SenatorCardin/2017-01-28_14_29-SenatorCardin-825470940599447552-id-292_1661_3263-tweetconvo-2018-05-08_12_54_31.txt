You don’t just ask an authoritarian nicely. You stop them. Use your power and be a roadblock!
Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.

You peddle bullshit, I stand with the founding fathers.
no I don’t
yes I am
can't you guys do something to stop him?  Isn't he impeachable???
withhold consent! The Reps did to Obama. Use the strategy & use it well.
Cardin doesn't have a clue. Stop pandering for votes. Vetting doesn't endanger the US, it protects it.
How much more "vetting" can you possibly need? How is 2 years by 5 agencies not fucking enough?
Vetting has been a joke for the last 4+ years. Kerry could not be trusted.
Call for hearings, start Court challenges, begin Impeachment proceedings-in whatever order you like
Thank you @SenatorCardin for speaking out against @POTUS & his horrific & unconstitutional #MuslimBan #NoBanNoWall

Pl vote to reject nominees for Justice, State, Education and HHS. POTUS is making us insecure at home and abroad

Not one more vote for his nominees, senator.

So you want to let people in who might become terrorists if we do not?  #CardinTreason
thank you Senator Cardin! Keep defending the Constitution!!!
.@SenatorCardin Thank you for opposing the refugee ban, please continue to be vocal #NoBanNoWall

Thank you!!!  You are our frontline of defense.
Thank you but you have to do more than show up! Attend protests, bring your colleagues, pass legislation to stop this!
@IndivisibleMCMD @potus Thank you Sen Cardin.  Your constituents .  Resist the Trump agenda.  No to nominees.  No to hate.
He won't rescind because that would mean he was wrong. He just needs to be REMOVED.
thank you for speaking out against this dangerous and offensive executive order
More anti-immigration orders coming if this stands. Please stand firm now, or it will get worse for immigrants.
call on him again - does not seem to be listening!
and this is addressed to President Double Down?  best of luck to you, Sir @SenatorCardin @KimRippere @POTUS
What are you doing about this? I see our other legislators at local airports protecting our citizens. Where are you?
please do all you can to FIGHT @POTUS on this!
Can this man be stopped or are the next 4 years going to see our country become a fearful place for so many
thankyou for not supporting this ban.  To me it shows you care about people Of all faiths.
Hey @SenatorCardin, I guess no fly lists without due process are fine for gun grabbing, but not protecting America? I support the @POTUS
Thank you Senator. Take a stand. Let me know how I can help you.
will you be at bwi this evening?
I agree with you sir. Now what's  the next step to stop the President. We need action from Congress not just words.
please tell this foolish trump we have troops over there ! One death it's on his soulless self
Thank you! Now what can you/we do to get this imbecile @POTUS impeached before he kills us all?
Thank you for your words. Terrorism is a grave threat to the world, but this ban does not help it.
sure if we let them in they will not want to kill us.
Thank you for opposing the EO!
Thank you, Sen. Cardin, for opposing this unfair, unAmerican EO. Pls. take action; I will support you. #nobannowall
With all Obama did to ruin our nation and he didn't get impeached, why should Trump? 

M
Thank you for not staying quiet in our Nation's time of need. #resist
Thank you, but don't stop there — keep fighting for American values. Please vote against AG nominee.
Thank you, Mr. Cardin, for standing up to a bad decision made by @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
Some reps surely still have enough common sense to see the danger Bannon & trump present?
I know Dems are in the minority, but surely his actions & conflicts of interests are enough to start the ball rolling.
Thank Senator Cardin for opposing this un-American EO
How 'bout before he harms & traumatizes any more #refugees & green card holders?! #RefugeesWelcome
Congress must address NPD situation & lack of stability/experience in oval office. #Unfit to lead
Thank you for speaking out. Not our values. Not constitutional.
it already is! We have heroes in danger because of unfit trump!
thank you for your stand against #muslimban
#StopPresidentBannon
Impeach and replace him!
Explain to folks that @POTUS signed a ban but the law for VWP already had sufficient scrutiny- Your S.2458 helped see to that
This EO is unAmerican, unconstitutional & immoral. Your statement is not strong enough!
Thank you Senator for standing up for true American values! #NoBanOnRefugees
Thank you. @POTUS
Thank you, Senator! Stand up to the spineless. Be the democratic spirit to light our way forward in America. We are watching you!
Thank you, from a Takoma Park constituent.

I want to hear and see you protesting Trump's dictatorial executive actions
Thank you for speaking out about this, but what are you actually planning to DO? We need you to fight harder.
he is protecting American people Gaeat on board!!
The executive branch is defying the judicial, the legislators MUST act.  https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/department-homeland-security-response-recent-litigation … Tell us what you're doing, Senator.
Thanks, this nation is a land of immigrants and we need to welcome more, esp. refugees! They'll make us stronger!
.@SenCoryGardner represent the people of Colorado who find these type of actions shocking and wrong like @SenatorCardin and resist @POTUS
Article 25!
Agreed. Potus is a fascist puppet, did Putin make this order? #MinorityPOTUS #FauxPOTUS
Refugees from Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Somalia should be resettled in Maryland, near Ben Cardin's home.
There are houses for sale in my neighborhood. They'd be welcomed here.
I'm not sure you'd be happy with the results. Look at what's happening in Europe.
Completely different. These people have been thoroughly vetted, not boatloads of random individuals.
They have visas, which were necessary to get on the plane. Some people being detained have green cards. They're legally US persons.
Are these immigration actions bordering on "high crimes and misdemeanors" yet?
Sen Cardin, did you object to Obama's Iraqi refugee ban is 2011?
Please resist Trump's Muslim ban with all you have, and your constituents will back you up!
Thank you. Are you reaching out to GOP leadership as well?
Thank you, sir, for standing against this shameful and unAmerican ban. #MuslimBan
@RefugeesIntl @POTUS   MORE HYPOCRISY: Obama Banned all Iraqi Refugees for 6 Months in 2011 – Liberals SAID NOTHING!
Can't call on POTUS with anything but US Marshalls. No diplomacy w/a coup. The ONLY question now: How to REMOVE Trump.

.@DiamondandSilk give you the spill about @realDonaldTrump 1st week as @POTUS. Putting the American People first feels great.  #ChooChooBaby

John--I've posted a copy of the Court's order here:  http://slnews.us/pb012817a 
Thanks for your efforts!
Overturn this garbage.
