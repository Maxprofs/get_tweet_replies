Thank you, sir.  You have my respect and my support.
In sum, you have voted over and over to try to outspend nature. $4 Billion per day spent in world on faux science
counting on y'all to STOP THE MADNESS!!
VOTE NO on Pruitt! DeVoss is a disaster too.
Thank you sir!
Matt Gaetz,  Florida House Rep has drafted bill  to completely abolish EPA.

He has just fought against Government over reach, and so should you if you did your job.

Thank you Senator!  #Pruitt is a threat to the Earth.  #climatechange is real and #Science is not a liberal conspiracy.
Thank you Senator!!
@ungaggedEPA @EPA stop the madness!!! #DeleteDonald
Of course Trump wants to hire a head of a department he has been against for so long. That makes no sense.. Of course.
Take it to the GOP rednecks.  They hunt and fish.  Assume they want clean forests and rivers.
Thank you! Rachel Carson's state thanks you!
