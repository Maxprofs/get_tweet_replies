you americans are so messed up-denying people healthcare-put the shoe on your foot for size
@22Avengers @HouseGOP
You had 7 years to come up with an alternative to Obama.
This is the best you've got?
#Trumpcare
.@SenatorCardin @griffbos @HouseGOP Ur assuming they wanted 2 come up with a plan. They didn't & this proves it. #GOPlies #obamacare
.@SenatorCardin @IdahoResistance @HouseGOP 
Throwing millions out of the lifeboat is a PLAN? Need #Medicare4ALL
Say NO to #Trumpcare

#ResistTrumpCare
They are the dog that caught the bus. They never thought they'd actually have to do something. #SavetheACA
Take from the poor/elderly/children and give to rich  @SpeakerRyan plan with a big smile on his face
It does exactly what they want it to -- lines their own pockets. Thank you for fighting them, sir.
This is a TAX CUT, not healthcare. It's paid for with American lives.
24 Mil lose healthcare - 20 Mil added by ACA.
4 Mil fewer will have healthcare than before ACA.
@TNsmartgal @HouseGOP And after 7 years the best they can come up with 'who knew health care was so hard'?..OMG.
@kegill @HouseGOP Let's make Medicare for all and allow Ins Cos to sell polices for "buy up" plans! Compromise!!
Hopefully you won't be bankrupting and killing me anytime soon! What does putin have on all of you? #russiagate
@22Avengers @HouseGOP YOU SUCK! Complain 4 years, but you've got NOTHING? Just want 2 repeal cuz Obama did it?Cuz black prez?
If OBAMA would have done a good Deal,people wouldn't be so  The reason why many wanted CHANGE,N GOD SEND US DJT !
READ. DID YOU HEAR..FBI IS INVESTIGATING DONNIE T. AND HIS CABINET
@mcspocky @HouseGOP This says it all.
we are in this situation because of the Democrats I wouldn't be speaking if I was a Democrat hang your head low
@mcspocky @HouseGOP And they sabotaged ACA with Rubio & other republicans leaving out reimbursement for ins co so that Prem >
They never thought they'd be in a position to do it. They're better at bitching than doing #AHCA flop
Why don't try to work with the other side all I see you do is complain, help your constituents.
AHCA aka #trumpcare aka the reverse robin hood bill. Steal $1-10k from every 99%er, give $50-100+k to every $1%er.
@comictonypowell @HouseGOP while Cardin did nothing for seven years watching the ACA implode and die on the vine. Blame who?
Terrible, terrible bill. No good for anyone except Repub ideologues and insurance companies.
It has nothing to do with healthcare-it's about making the rich, richer. "Healthcare" another scam.
Thank you
@Politics_PR @HouseGOP All they a\had was 7 years. They had one job. #FAIL
Incredible.
Is this a form of population control and genocide of poor, sick, elderly and disabled?  Sure seems like it #ACHA
when they care more about where their donations come from than their votes....
@mcspocky @HouseGOP -It is a joke but if it fails tomorrow trump will quit trying
Hypocrite You all created the mess and joke about people trying to fix it Pathetic @KellyannePolls
They know Single Signer is in #WeThePeople's best interests & helps big w/Debt reconciliation-
@JustWhatNowWhy @HouseGOP We got to stop playing these games. The alternative was to repel and replace with nothing
@VeryEasily @HouseGOP @GOPHouse @GOPSenMajority @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump TRUMPcare KILLS!
@CariONeil3 @HouseGOP DEMs called it, GOP HAD NO PLAN!!!
Stand up to the bullies.
ROME WAS NOT BUILD IN 1 DAY.AHCA BILL CAN  COUPLE F DAYS.During7 yrs GOP MEMBERS WR On BOARD,Adjustm,Cost SUCCESS!
SAD! Stand up for us sir!
Dems had seven years to fix the ACA.  Don't blame your failure on others.  Step up and propose a fix to the ACA.
as a Maryland Voter & Navy Veteran #resist the #GOPs theft of SCOTUS seat and #Trumpcare if it comes 2 you.
this happens when you spend your effort trying to invent problems to solve, rather than find ways to improve.
This isn't health care, it's health scare for millions of Americans who will be left without hope.
Seven years! Nothing! This is a load of crap! However, Senator Cardin, perhaps a few fixes are in order?
@ChrisVanHollen @SpeakerRyan 
LYING SEAN fails to show
DEMs against because it hurts US
GOP/FC against -want US to hurt more

They simply want to give #tinyHands a win for his frail ego and kill folks
Hopefully Democrats can come up with a plan to fix the ACA when Ryan's plan is DOA - show the GOP how governing is done.
@suzanthony7 @HouseGOP it's boils down to one thing, Racism. Trump and the GOP leaders hate  Obama, a black man.
truth
keep going we are depending on you
#Trumpcare  sucks.
What are your plans to fix healthcare?
#AHCA is so BAD, they had to keep it under wraps or they would have all lost their jobs!
It's the best they've got.They're working hard to make it worse and get rid of that pesky women's healthcare, too!
#THANKYOUOBAMA
And this is the version that isn't ruthlessly anti-poor enough for the @freedomcaucus to find palatable.
@All100Senators @HouseGOP And you could be bipartisan and help make a better HC plan 4 the American ppl. Dem plan failed!!!
You get an "A" for you work to defeat this bill, but an "F" on graph making. This is horrendous.
GOP rushed to get this out without full due diligence just so @POTUS 45 can claim he delivered on campaign promise.
