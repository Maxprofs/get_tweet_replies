thanks mr President
.@POTUS It's as if your admin. can't see the evil empress #KweenKrookedKillary is buck naked, EXCEPT your brother! #VAXXED #CDCwhistleblower
I saw documentary "Semantics-The Rise &Fall of Muammar al Gaddafi"https://youtu.be/qVHzAinRH4g . Anyone who sees it will NEVER vote Hillary
I am now devastated that I voted for you twice. I never would have voted McCain or Romney, but you are NOT any better.
You are no better than Bush, and @realdonaldtrump kicked out the Neocons out of GOP. Now NEOCON Hillary hijacked the Dem Party
#Hexit>@POTUS For the survival of the planet, every American MUST see this documentary and vote @realDonaldTrump
Michelle Obama's speech brought tears 2 my eyes as my daughter's Malia's age. I agree, our children & they're future's safe w/#HRC
