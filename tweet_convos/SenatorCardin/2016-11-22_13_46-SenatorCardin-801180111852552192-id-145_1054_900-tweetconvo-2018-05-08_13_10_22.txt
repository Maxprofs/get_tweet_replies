Thank you for leading this charge! Not even (maybe especially not) the president is above the Constitution.
I support @SenatorCardin's resolution to get @realDonaldTrump to put assets into #blindtrusts. No pres should have such clear COI. #WallofUs
Thank you. I am one of your constituents, and we urge all of our representatives to OBEY THE CONSTITUTION
Thank you for your leadership on this important concern.
your resolution would be unconstitutional and would hinder @realDonaldTrump from doing his job as POTUS
I suspect the senator knows more about the Constitution than you, mortgage man. Cheers!
THINK SO ?
hope y Resolution will amass bipartisan support or GOP really sold its soul to the devil #ImpeachTrump
I'm glad to hear that, thank you
thank you. This is an important step. America's interests must be put first.
, thank you. This is reassuring. Action must be taken now to ensure the constitution is not blatantly violated come January.
thank you. This is so critical.
Sir, we need to #AudittheVote
