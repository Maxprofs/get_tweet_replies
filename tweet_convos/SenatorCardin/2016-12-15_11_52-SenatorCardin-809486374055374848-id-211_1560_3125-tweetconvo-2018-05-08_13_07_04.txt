Bill would force Trump to shed conflicts of interest or risk impeachment
http://hill.cm/LmjHXmJ  
@Gluonsrule @thehill "Risk"?!
i'm sayin'.
@BoingBoing Newsflash: the EC not acting as a stopgap from handing the presidency to an existential threat is a crisis
We are already IN a constitutional crisis.  Still, let's see which Repubs try to stop this legislation.
@thehill You can count on one thing Sir. PE Trump and his lawyers will outsmart you.
thank you, Senator Cardin.
.@SenatorCardin Thank you! But we already have a Constitutional crisis, the PPEOTUS is an enigma & may well be a Russian puppet.
please move fast.
He worked with Putin to cheat an election and you're concerned about his business interests?!?! HES A TRAITOR #LOCKHIMUP
boo hoo a Trump bot said a not nice thing, i think ill go cry now ,, lololol #fuckingloser
Thank you. Please continue to fight for this. We, the people, are depending on you.
Delete your account. Resign. .@SenatorCardin @thehill
The potential for abuse is too great without this bill. @realDonaldTrump has shown no voluntary restraint so must be passed.
Thank you
@TheObamanista @thehill He'll take it to court, tying it up for 4 years so he doesn't have to comply.
Please keep up the fight!
Pro Patria. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Cardin!
@thehill than you Senator and everyone who supports this, ignore the trolls, don't give them  a voice,they hate to be ignored
Thank you, Senator. Please do not back down.
How cute.

You think there will be law and order for us little people after 1/20.

Applaud your efforts, nonetheless.
@summerbrennan @thehill Thank you!
He used Exec Orders cuz of Repub obstruction. Not illegal. Trump's conflicts of interest is.His kids sit in on mtgs!
though you guys can keep kicking the can on the budget and almost shutting down the government every three months. Fix it
@thehill 
Nothing in constitution
Says Presidents can't own Property or have money! Trying to impeach before Day 1 pathetic!
do you not understand what conflict of interest means? Low information Trumpkin I guess
Or did you forget your precious President Obama did not use a blind trust? Hmmm double edged sword!
Thank you Senator Ben Cardin for standing up. Agreed-no President is above the law and we must avoid a #ConstitutionalCrisis.
Partisan obstructionism at work! @SenatorCardin when is your pathetic term up? Time for you to go "Grasshopper"
@BoingBoing Nope, gfy. Clinton, Bush, & Obama, all had businesses while in office. Why this selective bill? More Democrat BS.
if electoral can not protect us from foreign influence in our elections, as they are suppose to, why have an electoral?
- Thank you, Senator.
Trump CAN'T utter as PEOTUS w/o affecting his own financial interests & $713 million debt. #hamiltonelectors
Thank you
thank you for ensuring this.
@thehill Thank you Senator!! Our nation must have faith in our institutions of governance, or they will not last.
Thank you! 
Make this happen!  America can not be the Trump family cash cow for sale to the highest bidder.
@thehill Thank you!  You know you doing a great job when so many paid Russian trolls start attacking!! Conflicts = mistrust.
@thehill GREAT JOB. MAKE IT STICK
You are a peacock who needs to think hard about what you have done to America http://usdebtclock.org  95 million out of work
lol Constitutional crises lol Little over board don't u think?!
So if you wld do the same to HRC why didn't you do anything about Obama?! Stop being a hypocrite! Bring your party together!
There is no law stating Trump has to do away with his companies! Besides you don't even know what Trump is going to do yet!!!
@TeamCavuto #ConflictOfInterest
When are yall (Democrats) going to work harder at bring country together rather than pulling us apart?! JUST STOP!!! PLEASE!
@TeamCavuto #ConflictOfInterest

YOUR A HYPOCRITE. Nobody need become poor to serve country. You will find an uprising of like you haven't seen against dems
GEORGE - E WASHINGTON HAD GLOB'S OF LAND THAT MAKE TRUMP LOOK LIKE A SLAVE!  

I WAS AN IND., NOT ANYMORE!  U GUY'S R A JOKE!
constitutional  duties without  legal restraints. Yep you sure know your  hit
The  theory behind exempting the  President and Vice President  from this  law is that they  need to carry  out their

Wrong- In fact, 18 U.S.C. Section 202 specifically states, as relating to Section 208 which deals with financial interests:
Dear Ben,  you are a HACK!  H-A-C-K, HACK!  

YOU DID GREAT ON CAVUTO!  KEEP IT UP, TRUMP 2020 IS ROLLIN!

BY THE WAY (con't)
Please tell us where the constitution discusses the wealth of the president elect? Carter had a peanut farm & the bush's oil.
You are a joke and further proving it more so. You need to read a little history and note Kennedy, Johnson.
If I understood @Judgenap DT can keep his bis and not break the Constitution! POTUS & VP are exempt from conflict of interest
I'M MD RESIDENT & SEN. CARDIN U R AN A**! WHERE WAS THIS PROPOSAL W #Obummer OR #HellHillary WHO TOOK FOREIGN MONEY 4 FAVORS!
You sound like a sore loser. Don't preach the Constitution to us. Much of what Obama has done could be challenged.
but it's not in the constitution ! Washington did not put MountVernon in a blind trust,  working plantation GW richer then DT
Obama  never set up a blind trust according to wash times
I prefer a president who comes 2 office with a personal fortune, than Hillary who left with one.  Congress turned a blind eye
AND..understand this....The people have spoken!! So STOP your BS partisan political hogwash. Thank you.
you lied on @TeamCavuto about Trump wealth. The Constitution does NOT force Trump to put wealth into blind trust.
Sir, I have just seen you being interviewed by Neil Cavuto. Since when are you Dems so concerned about following...
...the Constitution?? Many times President Obama went beyond his Constitution authority via Executive Orders, skirting....
...around Congressional authority, etc., and no Dem (as far as I know) protested the ignoring of the Constitution. Indeed...
...President Johnson had many investments and wealth (as Neil said), but was not required to surrender any of these.  Sir...
...I think this is simply a "sour grapes" plot to get revenge on President-elect Trump and on those who voted for him by...
....implementing possible impeachment proceedings. Hillary lost because she simply was a bad candidate with TOO MUCH...
...baggage. You Dems have ignored middle and small town America for too long with insults, looking down upon us, not...
...honestly addressing our concerns, insulting and attacking our religious and ethic beliefs, our way of life, and forcing...
Y didn't U raise hell over the Clinton Foundation.  Hill & Bill R worth 200M & they have a fortune in the crooked foundation.
you are batshit crazy ! Your side lost !
WHERE have you been? Obama has Trashed our Constitution by refusing to enforce Laws! @realDonaldTrump is a PATRIOT!
Where were u as Hillary sold us out? Or when Obama bypassed the Constitution by pen & phone? Hypocrite.
#ConstitutionalCrisis
P.S. Ed Rollins just debunked your entire misinterpretation of our Constitution. You must be a "scholar" just like Obama.
I THINK TRUMP FARTED TODAY. DID HE DO IT WRONG? OBAMA WROTE A BOOK WHILE HE WAS PRES, & MADE MILLIONS, AND STILL SELLS BOOKS.
YOU need to resign. U are senile & a corrupt Democrat that does not know how to LOSE. Trump won. Get over it.
You are a traitor to the USA. Where were U when Hillary was above the law, hmmm? You need to resign.  Defeat coming in 2018.
@thehill Just like Presidents Washington and Jefferson right?  How bout you focus on serving the interests of MD for a change
You & Senator Warren must be giving equal concern to the foreign $$ received by Hillary, yes? @TeamCavuto @KellyannePolls
Finally someone takes a stand!! Thank you. This man is damaging us; has nothing to fo with party!!
@BBC @LAtimes @FoxNews @TeamCavuto
Get to work, sir!
you are sore losers. Get over it. You lost. I will happily contribute $$$ to your oponent in your next election.
A fu**ing NO BRAINER!
I agree, but it's sad that it requires a bill when it is already codified. You know? @julichilliard
@thehill Thx, Senators-especially @DickDurbin .This is what happens when we have a millionaire PEOTUS who isn't a statesman.
Please include that ALL elected officials should do this, including you and other members of Congress.
maybe you should've stopped Obama from trampling the Constitution #Constitutionalcrisis #careerpolitions #draintheswamp
Then please support the President when he declares the President Elect a foreign agent and asks for his arrest.
unless HRC would have won right? I mean she is/can be above the law right?
You have had 2 Sec states in breach of OWN bullshit trying to push here...partisan politics to the bone...sore losers
@corvetteBeth @thehill Good
And you're on the Foreign Relations Committee. #ConstitutionalCrisis Use Impeachment to enforce #EmolumentsClause.
My Senator! #ProudMarylander
uhm.. you Senators don't start impeachment.. the House does.. cold day in hell that we'd impeach. Elections have Consequences
No, you're just BITTER that HILLARY lost and that's nothing to be "PROUD" of.
@thehill Well, I think you must be a hypocrite........@HillaryClinton has been above the law for a very long time.
are you fking kidding me pal?
Hitlary has PROVEN that you ALL are ABOVE the law.
@thehill good job! Keep it up
@Juliane_Seattle @thehill AND he needs 2 release his tax return!
The fear of many Americans is that Trump can do anything to us that he wants without consequence bc no one seems to care.
EXACTLY
@EmmaSnapea @thehill thank you for your effort! Doesn't this have to pass a republican house, though?
Yes, which means this is nothing but grandstanding.
@thehill why didnt they close the clinton Foundation. Seems hypocritical
so why didn't do you do it for Hillary?
Thank you for doing the right thing. It's not a party issue. It's an America issue.
Thank you, thank you, Senator.
thanks for what? NOT saying shit when GAY MURDERING SAUDIS gave Hillarys 'charity' $25 million?
@thehill you are acting like the Dems have power in the house and senate... oh wait you don't. 
no president or congressmen/women, senator or gov't official is ever above the law. But yet the only thing they care about 
That's good, but we should avoid getting him into WH in the first place. Everybody knows he's unfit and criminal.
Thank you Sen Cardin.
Thank you Senator!
& the fucker hasn't even started yet!
@thehill let he who is without sin throw first stone.  Prepare to be exposed. #draintheswamp
You showed equal concern when @HillaryClinton sold SOS access for personal benefit, right? (insert sound of crickets here)
Well so called Senator why didnt you all do that when Obama started using his damn pen and phone? Shame on you Dems & Reps
@thehill what a bunch of fucking crybabies, Clinton was above the law, all lawmakers are above the law, such hypocrisy
thank you
@thehill if you nut jobs put half the effort into the county as you do against @realDonaldTrump  this country would be better
retire...u r a dinosaur...
@thehill
#iVoted #accept it.
Hillary would be in prison in a fair world
Hillary is above the law
Thank you for your leadership- I'm happy you're one of my senators!
@thehill you're weird fam
Losing JOBS? OBAMA HAS CREATED MILLIONS!! GWB was losing 800,000 a Month!! Read stuff other than Coal Whiner.
@thehill who the fuck is this cherry?
@devislaskar @thehill thank you for this bill, Senator, but we are already in a Constitutional crisis
@thehill this is called sour grapes ya old ass mf
YOUR JUST HURT FROM A BIG LANDSLIDE WIN. YOUR PARTY IS IN CRISIS MODE. UNBELIEVABLE. REGROUP AND FIND A NEW MESSAGE.
Landslide victory by HILLARY! Trump kids NOT ELECTED, ILLEGAL to work in govt. Did you pass 4th grade?
We need to test all govt officials w. GED & Citizenship exams. Can't trust them to actually have passed
You were fine with the Clintons accepting obscene amounts of cash from foreign governments but are upset about this? SMH
#TrumpTrain
@thehill all this proves is that Trump has been telling the truth all along.  All you saying thank you are idiots.  #MAGA
@EndTrumpsLies @thehill Trump has no choice/there are only 2 remedies; divest or impeach
@JJohnson2u There is already a law in place. Why spent time on a frivolous bill that will never pass anyway.
Thank you, sir!
@thehill how about the laws #HRC broke?  Laws already in place.  Now your creating a law for Trump to violate???
@thehill if no president is above the law then why is Obama not in prison for aiding and arming Isis?
You are no true American. Politicians like you just continue to divide our nations coming up with zero solutions to our problems
@thehill Thank you!
@thehill  then why didn't we do this with Obama ? Retarded
Obama's kids not in meetings, not running billion$ biz. Why do believe he belongs in jail Harper?
this has nothing to do with obamas kids Obama should have been impeached you have to be born in the us
Oh dear God. You still believe that crap. Even Trump has given it up.
I'm just stating a fact
Facts have credibility, evidence. You have neither! Just hate.
@thehill can we include Secretary of State, senators, congress etc???
If nobody is above the law? Impeach @BarackObama and arrest the old drunk  @HillaryClinton
Russian.  Go home.
you talk of this conflict, but never held HRC accountable for hers.  You are a joke.
is a coward. How about HRC? Who's lining your pockets?
well said.
Saudis are probably giving her more 'donations'.
@thehill take king/ruler Babylon down b4 USA go down instead! Short list/leash.DJT gone buck wild !
Thank you Senator!
@thehill bring it on ....
@thehill Thank you. I am proud to call you my senator!
@thehill Please do it and help America be free of DT interests!
@thehill You're my hero, Senator Cardin!
@thehill THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP!
At this point I would question giving this unstable person any information at briefings.  Can't control himself or his kids
WOO HOO!!!!  THANK YOU!!!
Thank you, Senator
@thehill thank you. Electors must be briefed on Russia's involvement before Monday's vote. Our #democracy depends on it.
Why not just say "Vladimir Putin ate my homework." And we live in a Constitutional Republic
