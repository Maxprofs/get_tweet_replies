booooo!
Thank you for standing up for health care. Please stand up to big pharma profits. They are bleeding us dry.
@WomenG4Hillary we're just beginning to address the opioid epidemic!!!!
replace with what?
So nothing. They have nothing to replace it with. Thanks for clarifying.
table your wasting your talents i think youd best be suited for any teen tv series
drone? We were screwed along before Trump. Agenda 2030 cause any alarms?
@  a very large and increasing portion of theUS will vote out all GOP if they screw with this!
Doubtful
Middle Class families have been NOTHING but taxed and abused by you Democrats. We voted that oUT of our lives. Go
@biloxichoctaw of course it will!!

Lies, lies and more lies.  ACA TAX passed because of the stupidity of the voters and the congress NOT READING IT.
Such lies. Obama stole half a billion from seniors for his horrible Obamacare that noone can afford!!
@lionessmom76 Please save the ACA!  I have a pre-existing condition and MUST have healthcare!  Please fight for us!
@NancyOsborne180 very disappointed in your refutation of obama effort to keep Israel within the bounds of international law
GROW UP...YOUR TIME IS FINISHED! #NOMOREDEMIDIOTS
@Newyorker2212 Ok seniors just try to find insurance with pre-existing conditions. Try to understand the stock mkt!
That's a fucking lie. There is no plan to cut #Medicare. Here is the plan (u probably co-sponsored half these things)
If u voted for the CURES Act, you already voted for the first item on the Republican plan for #Medicare. What a fucking liar
So you're saying without Obamacare your premiums wouldn't go up? What insurance do you have?? I want what you got!!
a lie is a lie, that's who Trump is. Some folk surrendered their integrity in order to vote him in office. Why? Hate?
Why is anyone surprised?- the times any truth was uttered by him could fit on a postit
a promise from @realDonaldTrump with worthless. #ConMan #Lair #Unamerican #Traitor.. other than that he's a nice guy
GOP healthcare = die quicker
@PaulBegala They bulk of them are low class, money grubbing liars.
@PaulBegala let them ..see if they ever win an election again. Even racists like Medicare
And, Trump hasn't tweeted in 8 hours. He's gone dark. Off the grid. What a loser. #TheResistance #notmypresident
Democrats plan with ACA is to Make America Poor again. #makeAmericapooragain  Do an unnatural act with yourself.
@PaulBegala hey @realDonaldTrump now this is branding...what you do is lying
@PaulBegala   Trump's new healthcare plan is being called, "HeDon'tCare" #HeDon'tCare
@PaulBegalaThank you Mr. senator the great state of Maryland appreciates your work !
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump Be a hero and shut GOP down. They have no respect for you.
@PaulBegala #TheResistance
All he does is tell lies. HRC tried to warn people
.@SenatorCardin @EricIdle From my friend in STL #makeAmericaSickAgain
@sheilad715 can't trust GOP ever or Donald Drumpf. Liars and connivers
America must stand up against these bullies. Join the fight it is our right to speak up and be heard!
We will fight. As a woman I will not pay more than men for health care! I will call my state representative in the morning.
@SenateDems assholes. Cancelled 12/31/16. Old plan $347/mo, new plan $650/mo. Same giant deduct. Go #Trump Go! 
shows us some proof of how this is going to hurt us; not just words. Make it factual.
stop your damned scare mongering!!
well thank your Democrats for that.
Remember Romney care in Massachusetts? Very successful oObamacare the same thing. Popular in Mass. the Rs just call it Trumpcare.
Wrong again.  You don't listen.
@realdonaldtrump FAKE NEWS!  FACT: obama took $500B from MEDICARE.
Open ended budget (8 trillion increase) & planned cuts in  Medicare & Medicaid
Gutless republicans should have an ACA replacement plan ready 4 our review. Hope trump voters are paying attention!
Especially since they've had 6 years to come up with one!! 
How did Democrats lose 1,040 seats under Obama if everyone agrees with you. Paying 3x as much as I used to is making me sick.
@tkdmike 
#GOP
Always disturbing news
Obama already took $700,000,000 from Medicare, you are all from the same cloth. You think you deserve better than the people
And toads & snakes will fall from the sky & the oceans will spill over the lands & frankly this is a lot of crap!
@SenSchumer A prime example of fake news. You have no idea what Republican's plan will be but you fear monger anyway. Losers!
Lies lies lies from the party of liars.
Absolute BS.
BS propaganda from the left. ACA repeal and replace by Trump will undo the Obama broken promises of failed ACA.
@ElizabethRowin they don't care about paying more for medicine. Sometime you wanna say let them pay 50.00 per pill.
Let the American People see who they voted for Let it be repealed and cut, He will resign before the first Term.
Trump is being a follower not a leader dick riding people that want to fail him he knows nothing about Equality
Terrible!!!
@SenSchumer Prove it! My Medicare funds have been stolen by Obama & Dems.already. My SSI increase.3% went 2 Medicare! LIES!
#MakeAmericaSickAgain Trump will ruin the country
@badwolf303  The naïveté of American voters believing anything Trump says is appalling and tragically disappointing!
Are these promises like keeping your doctor, premiums going down and families saving. If so, then they are LIES.
@KellyannePolls said no one will lose ins. I'm sure she knows what she's talking about.
@SenatorCardin @SenSchumer
Bravo, Senator Schumer, for standing up to the sociopath!
I hope it can be made clear that any member of Congress who votes to reduce Soc Sec or Medicare will be gone next election
You are our voice.  #StandUpForUs    http://bit.ly/2iIVeYZ 
Its getting 2 the Point I cant afford My RX,MY BP med went from $36 about 3yrs ago 2 now $96 W/RX Plan!

@SenSchumer that is incorrect
@SenSchumer seniors are our most vulnerable citizens. We owe to them to see that they are taken care of
What current plan?  The GOP has not offered one.  Where are you getting this?
You didn't seem outraged when Obamacare cut Medicare...
@SenSchumer change slogan to:
#DoNotMakeAmericaSickAgain
We are middle class and our insurance,prescriptions are unaffordable under the"affordable care act".
@SenSchumer like y'all did with Obama care
We see you!
middle class families were already wrecked by Obama care with rising premiums and huge deductibles.
I thought you said they didn't have a plan? Which is it?
Nancy Pelosi“The most privileged person in America has better health because if everyone has health, everyone is in the loop"
.. Supposedly Sessions has convinced Trump to 'drastically reduce' Medicaid payouts.
BULLSHIT!
We are already SICK of the #SchumerClowns approach to governance and health care. #MakeAmericaSickAgain is stupid
Trump Tweeted (!) that he would NOT cut Soc. Sec., Medicare or Medicaid. By lying, he'll #MakeAmericaSickAgain
MORE SCARE TACTICS. MEDICARE FUNDS WERE ATOLEN TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE.! Put that money back!
S T O L E N,  Twitter..!
@SenSchumer If you don't believe Schumer look at Paul Ryan's website!  They want to cut Medicare
And bankruptcies will affect middle class fams who face cancer, get kicked off insurance. That's the worst. Ppl will die.
@realDonaldTrump DEMOCRATS ROBBED MEDICARE FOR OBAMACARE!  I TRUST PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WORD.
Great message. Also need to present re positives. DEMS trying to SAVE Medicare coverage 4 etc. Negs didn't work.
Keep flailing, Baghdad Bob.
thank you for stating on top of this!
republicanCare - you break it, you own it.
If we are sick & depressed we check out & don't care, protest or vote, which benefits the GOP. They want us sick & Uneducated
@SenSchumer I would say this is another Democrat lie as usual
hope you continue to say sky is falling in 2 yrs you lose again bigger You're not listening to American people.
i can not afford it with the tax subsidies. WTF i do???
@SenSchumer seniors have gained the right,after working all their life, 2 have free /low cost meds and care.they deserve it.
@senschumer What is the truth?
Wrong....#SchumerClown
@SenSchumer really silly slogan. Are you in 3rd grade?
Similar to MAGA. It's a slogan for people who refuse to think for themselves. 
@SenatorCardin @SenSchumer
What is that plan? Can you show it to me?
Yes Senator..we are sick of the high premiums, high deductibles ...tired of you picking our pockets for illegals.
I'd love to know what premium costs have to do with illegal immigration.
You seriously want a Trump subject to expend their one brain cell to answer you?
@senschumer  What is the truth?
Trump is a Putinist. How can we allow him to take the Oath?
@HillaryWasRight trump voters suckered by a grifter, when they have to pay more for meds who will they blame?
democrats will sink their ship to keep Obamacare cause the fear they will be racist if they don't fight for his legacy
