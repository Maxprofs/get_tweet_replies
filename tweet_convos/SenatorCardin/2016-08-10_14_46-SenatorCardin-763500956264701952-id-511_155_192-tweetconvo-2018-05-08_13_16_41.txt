.@TheJusticeDept Announces Findings of Investigation into #Baltimore Police Department â†’ http://go.usa.gov/xTVNC  
@TheJusticeDept @CivilRights What were you doing before the report?,
protecting Hillary from going to jail, that's her priority
I don't think they care I think they own the press
understoodIt's insulting that they think we aren't smart enough to know what they r doing
of what progressive, pro-social justice activism look and sound like (the opposite of what you're doing)
what I am doing is looking for @HillaryClinton to answer to the same charges anyone else would
@CivilRights @TheJusticeDept it's time that we start hounding this dept to do their jobs!
@CivilRights @TheJusticeDept
