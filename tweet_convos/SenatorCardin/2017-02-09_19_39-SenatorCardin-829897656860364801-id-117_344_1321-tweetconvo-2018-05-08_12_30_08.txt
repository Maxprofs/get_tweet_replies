Stop being so arrogant and start working for us! @POTUS is doing what we want, what we voted for. #Obstruction
You may enjoy playing with our safety for political gain; we don't appreciate it.
it should be, but he is a fucking idiot....so no.
you can't teach the narcissistic man anything as he believes he knows everything. #parallelstoHitler
we'd all like to think he'd learn. Can the Senate arrange a viewing of Schoolhouse Rock for him?
I wish I could say anything other than "Right........."
YES - NOT POLITICAL - but rather Judiciary Branch that has pledged to the public trust of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Perhaps it is you, Senator, that needs a teachable period of time and to act in the best interest of America.
@wendydavis That would require him to be teachable. #25thamendment
no he had his chance the first time the court stopped it
@SenateDems @POTUS key word being "should". Unfortunately, for @realDonaldTrump , it won't be.
od concern is that they knew for weeks and did nothing.  Anyone else involved?
Guess you didn't see Miller this morning expressing the judicial has no authority over the executive.
He'll do some schooling, & you're the student.
That is assuming that Trump is teachable, which is questionable
this is like the President over turning their Constitutional decisions. They are rogue. Impeach Judges Now.
:  Teachable Moment for the LIBERALS for the NEXT 8 years when they get their asses handed to them every day.
you will learn senator. It is a very teachable moment 4U2. Listen and do your job!
@RoyBlunt This is basic 5th grade curriculum!
this should be an impeachable moment for the @POTUS #ImpeachTrump
Dump trump NO DOUBT the most dangerous man in our government and a true liar
he and pence should be impeached
.@SenatorCardin Nah, #45 subscribes to the Seinfeld principle.  No hugging, no learning. @POTUS
Agree. POTUS would have a much better time moving his agenda if he didn't appear to be attempting a dictatorship.
Thank you
are we on a 3 strike policy? Once should be enough! This isn't a classroom.

@DrAlParsons @POTUS I think you mean "impeachable" lol
But Donald is incapable of learning. Also incapable of listening. Also, #trumpcantread
Problem is...stumpys ignores teachable moments like he ignores Ethics and the Truth!
@wendydavis MT: We can only HOPE our civil SERVANT @realDonaldTrump Sham @POTUS that the OLD Dog CAN learn a new trick!
@SenateDems @POTUS a Civics lesson; @KellyannePolls
that senator, is about as stupid a comment as you can get. You all checked and balanced when the law was written
funny thing is, this whole deal is allowed according to U.S. code title 8 chapter 12 subchapter 2 part 2 section 1182
@SenateDems @POTUS he's clueless
@SenateDems @POTUS The liberal judges don't have ANY regard for the law. That's why their the most overturned.
@SenateDems @POTUS Why are we having to teach this - POTUS not an entry level job and 25A gives us safe exit from this farce
@SenateDems @POTUS SHOULD...
@SenateDems @POTUS good luck with that lesson. I think it bears repeating again & again & again
@SenateDems @POTUS His mental illness prevents him from logic!  He will never understand...
@SenateDems And the @GOP apparently bc they are standing with DT.
@SenateDems @POTUS Something MOST learned in grade school!
@SenateDems @POTUS There are NO "teachable moments" for a egotistical Narcissistic sociopath like 45
@SenateDems @POTUS unlikely
Sen, he is mentally ill, and only thinks of himself. We need to #Impeach him, now.
@wendydavis @POTUS Operative words being "should be"
@SenateDems @POTUS Note that @POTUS has NOT overridden the courts decision however misguided. Despicables honor constitution!
@wendydavis @POTUS Sure, if he and Pres. Bannon weren't planning to overthrow our government.
@wendydavis @POTUS pretty sure this teachable moment should have been unnecessary for a President.
Gee, guess he should have borrowed that copy of the constitution from Mr Khan (and had someone read it to him)
@SenateDems @POTUS I don't think its teachable to Trump. He is reckless and keeps doubling and tripling down like it's Show
@SenateDems @POTUS It should be but...
Please, losersplain for us some more.

Your welcomed advice means so much.



@SenatorCardin @SenateDems @POTUS
@SenateDems @POTUS That's 5th grade curriculum. He should know that
@SenateDems @POTUS  congress & senate need to do their part as well, continue to stand up! Demand the GOP own this mess.
@SenateDems @POTUS The teachable moment can be covered during his impeachment proceedings, which will be coming!
@SenateDems @POTUS "Teachable" moments require pupils ready, willing & able to learn; @realDonaldTrump isn't such a pupil
Do you really think @POTUS is teachable?
Any normal person WOULD learn from this. 45, a sociopathic narcissist isn't willing to.He knows everything
@SenateDems @POTUS @DavidYankovich It should be, but u can't teach stupid
@SenateDems @POTUS Trump has learned nothing.
@SenateDems @POTUS   don't have high expectations... you will be disappointed
@SenateDems #ImpeachTrump the President should uphold our laws not try to destroy them!
@SenateDems @POTUS "Teachable moment?!"  Being President shouldn't involve on-the-job training.
.@WWE_AJLee @SenatorCardin @SenateDems @POTUS crooked? BC they understand the Constitution/BoRights? Stahp. Plz. You're in too deep
@SenateDems @POTUS Impeach and replace
@dgarrick5534 remind him he's not running is fail businesses,h e cannot bully his way around the Constitution
@SenateDems @POTUS this should be a lesson for you that you can't win remember 2018 will soon be here and you won't
I doubt it, you can teach someone that is mentally ill, they need to be medicated.
And for America. I am so distressed seeing how so many people lack knowledge of the basics of our govt.
@SenateDems @POTUS You cannot teach the unteachable.
@SenateDems @POTUS With all due respect, Senator, @realDonaldTrump has NEVER exhibited an interest in learning anything new.
@SenateDems @POTUS wait till the Supreme Court turns it. Then you'll learn the law.
teachable moment implies capacity to learn
Do you know what lol means Senator?  Lol, Trump will learn nothing, he's not capable.  Keep fighting for us!
ha! Teachable and POTUS in same tweet. Now that's funny.
@kaystowe62 @POTUS you would think
Trump has THE constitutional right and the opponents win shall be very short lived watch and see 
it'd be cool if the legislative branch could be involved in this sorcery of which you speak
dump trump trump has two speeds fast and dumb and slow and silly he operates on them all time
president has constitutional right and you all are having temper tantrums because you feel powerless that's FEAR!!!
It should be, but Donald doesn't seem to care much about school. I'm an exteacher. I know these things.
can't teach an old dog new tricks senator
if he doesn't know now we are in deep kimchi
@AllenEllis14 @POTUS It. Should be a teachable moment to your constituents that their senator doesn't read the constitution
.@bendur6 @SenatorCardin @AllenEllis14 @POTUS it seems the 9th Circuit Court of USA agrees with his reading of it.
But Chump comprehends better than anyone. Thus, he does not need to learn anything.
The President has no "shoulds" in his ego driven being. His policies just need to be put down when necessary.
Teachable moments,  Trump, ran out about 55 years ago.
Will go on until GOP removes him, 4 which they lack character.
very proud of u, Ben Frosh & MD senate dems - u will keep my vote by challenging #PresidentBannon
"Should be", but won't.
#Hahahahah #Bathrobe #WW #WhoHidHisDevice?
teachable or impeachable? Thin line there.
Obama gave IRAN billions. He is the one that should have been impeached.
It's clear now that he learned about checks and balances at #TrumpUniversity
Trump will get it done, watch and see!!!
The triumph will be very short lived for his opponents

the man is mentally ill, he doesn't learn lessons. Sooner ya'll admit that, sooner we can fix things. Its unraveling
