@keriRN @YouTube Its high time the @GOP experienced the full weight of the constitution .. Justice is best served cold
Tried and failed at the waste of taxpayer money .. No legit charges.. ever possible
..PBO nor Hillary have ever commited acts of Treason period.. give me one example of fact
You have zero proof of what you claim.. if this was the case where was the investigation
.@SenatorCardin Thank you! 100% in support of this critical starting point to prevent conflicts of interests in our highest office
Thank you Senator.  I am a resident of Maryland, and I fully support your resolution.
thanks
@FactYouSoHard @YouTube Amen
a law is needed to put a control on presidents telling them they are not above the law? What brought this on? Hill?
I'd like to start saying "lock him (DT) up!"
thank you Senator.
Keep fighting. Don't let these Republicans screw over the American people. Thank you.
YES. Thank You. I fully support this much needed action.
Good Luck, Senator. NO ONE will ever be able to hold him accountable. Didn't the election teach us that?
no president elect is above the law and Trump should be charged with treason, trying to overthrow our gov't.
He's won the election that is not overthrowing the government duh. Draining the Swamp is getting rid of corruption
he's fiilling it with everyone he conned u into believing he was against.
Thank tou for this Sir. America's interests before a Selfish, rich billionaire's.
He is not selfish are you kidding me? Shows how little you know
u need 2 do ur research on this his award claims are bogus and this is 1 of skeeviest  of all
.. Trump refuses to divest his foreign interests completely. The Electoral College must refuse HIM completely.
@jerryehudson @YouTube thank you Senator
He needs to work USA, He has to do business for USA, Any money need/made to be documented.
You go Senator! Lead like you MEAN it!!!
Appreciate it, Senator!
work in the best interest of the country!
No Republican CARES, most of all Trump.

So...
Constitutional crisis? 
If need be
.@SenatorCardin you must be aware that a blind trust is worthless. He must liquidate his assets and then place them into a blind trust.
*resolutions 1) #Trump #MustDivest per #Constitution  pic.twitter.com/eBouZxUZ08US & 2) always pro #Israel http://toi.sr/2fBlNx 
@norcalhappy @YouTube He's saying he'll divest to his children and that's fine with GOP majority. It's NOT a blind trust!
Great! Work It Dems! #ImWithPeoplesPresident
I am gobsmacked that, the President is exempt from conflict of interest laws. How is that possible?
you are a hero. Thank you!
.@SenatorCardin @seankent  Yes!  We now have a Pres. elect who thinks he has no legal boundaries.  #EmolumentsClause resolution
We are with you!
Thank You
I LOVE my Senators in Maryland.  Give him hell along with Chris Van Hollen!  Knowing you have our backs=good!
ah mental masturbatiin without climax... not even sterile enjoyment
Thank you and good luck
Sorry Ben, Trump will just say he is doing that, so do something real. Get investigation going into Russian vote hacking
@Alasscan_ @YouTube He'll lie, say he's giving his business to his kids. Hell deed them the D.C. Hotel and get away with it.
BLIND TRUST, not just taking his name off business agreements. His kids are not blind
Impeaching the loony fascist would be easier. @SenatorCardin
hell do a trust, satisfy every1 except it cant be blind, its his building's, not stock, so we'll accomplish nothing
No President is above the law? Did @SenatorCardin call for President #Obama to be impeached over undeclared conflicts?
Who cares? Why does one wrong make a right in your eyes? Trump is about to be Pres Obama is out.
neither are members of the House of Representatives and the senate @YouTube
ABOUT TIME
thank you.
Hoping to avoid a Constitutional crisis, I've introduced #EmolumentsClause resolution. No President is above the law https://youtu.be/3SrQkKyvKBQ 
Trumps efforts to me...still do not satisfy. The children have been involved in Government. Its a murky cauldron.
#EmolumentsClause should b renamed @HillaryClinton clause!
#BlahBlahBlah #StopPoliticalRhetoric. Emoluments Clause deals with salary/payment from Foreign states, kings, etc!
@marieinal BLIND TRUST IS NOT TURNONG. BUSINESS OVER TO FAMILY, ESPICIALLY WITH THEM WORKING IN WHITE HOUSE CONFLICT FOR SURE
@bannerite @YouTube keep going Senator! No prez should make $ from my tax dollars
@AndieMarie888 @YouTube Thank you Senator Cardin for standing up for us. We greatly appreciate your hard work and dedication
and thanks @SenatorDurbin for co-sponsoring. Now what can we do?
yes, we ARE watching and we WON'T be distracted. Thank you sir.
Thank you, Senator. Someone needed to do this.
// @Amy_Siskind - have you seen this
Thank you, sir.
THANK YOU! Please don't let this go!!
Keep on fighting for us.....
I hope this will stick to Trump. But he will just say it doesn't apply to him.

Hillary was selling access to the State Department using her foundation, and crickets from you.Trump wins and now a problem?
goodness knows how many times they went after Obama over nothing with GOP majority nothing will happen
@obbibb @YouTube Repubs don't count, right?
Like selling the State  Dept?

@TheWomensWatch 

Thank you!!!!
@cusackdr @YouTube Why now? these last minute reactions should of been done months ago! Prime example wht Dems are failing!
To be fair we've never had a president who so obv planned on making $$ off of his position as president.
That's exactly what should take him down! Assholes are going to take Social Security and Medicare
Nothing is going to take him down the force is with him. #MAGA
@MattMurph24 thank you sir, we need more people standing up for this country. Trump will destroy it
THANK YOU!! #democracy #NotKleptocracy #EmolumentsClause
@MartinHeinrich @YouTube Oh! Come on! Don't take Little Donny's toys away from him.

@aplemkseriously Dubya is above the law. #warcriminal
I hate to rain on the party but this is only a Non Binding Resolution. Nothing more than congress wagging it's finger. (cont)
to REALLY effect change,I urge you and others in Congress to repeal Presidential exception to: 1978 Ethics of Government Act,
1989 Ethics Reform Act & their predecessor: Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code! These laws - The 1st issued ... (cont)
as a reponse to Watergate!! ironically -  exempt the President. THIS is why Trump have conflicts!! REPEAL these exemptions!!
@SantiCoulon @YouTube @tribelaw 
EXACTLY ESPECIALLY TRUMP BUT HE THINKS HE IS
I think you are confusing that with the Treasonous HRC. She has 4 open investigations she's going to jail
thank you! Keep at it.
@devbost @YouTube 
Is there nothing that can be done about Bahrain and his hotel?

This makes our country sleazy.
In addition to constitutional crisis, I worry about Trump properties being terror target. Not that I'd visit one
....Thank You for fighting for the constitution.
@shannoncoulter @YouTube wow! thank you! definitely a lawyer!
Thank you.
THANK YOU! What can the average American do to support your efforts and put pressure to bear on others? We are here.
@Madam_Nyobi @YouTube Good luck with that.
Thank you Senator, Trump will destory America.
No he wont so ignorant. I'm sorry you missed out on WW3/ISIS invading us at the same time. HRC + NationalSEC=NO
THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! Keep fighting!
thank you for standing up for us! I hope others in the senate follow your example!

Hillary isn't above the law either
Thank you for this, sir.
I fear no one is going to care because Rs have majority.
Thank you!
Thank you, sir. You're on the right side of History. Those in govt aligning with DT or keeping silent are on the wrong side.
thank you from Illinois for doing this!  Tell us what regular citizens can do to help move this forward.
#partisancrap You're nearly 8-years too late
thank you!
What is the resolution number/reference so that I can ask my senators to support this resolution?
And how do we find the list of who's come out in support?
Thank you!
