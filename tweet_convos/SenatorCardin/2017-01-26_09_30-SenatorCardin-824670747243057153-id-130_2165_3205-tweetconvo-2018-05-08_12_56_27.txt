Cardin please vote NO on ALL nominees. Am a Md Resident. RESIST or we will find other representation
vote against Pruitt and Tillerson!
Global Warmism aka 'Climate Change' based on #FakeFacts @SenatorCardin @POTUS @EPA
And here's reality!
Means he's a very smart man, & perfect to look at the scientific process
So @realDonaldTrump & his #billionaires & #millionaires in govt aren't enriching themselves with his policies?
@SenSchumer sctuslly not true
Key word.  Facts? Surface Stations:  http://www.surfacestations.org/ 
@DzDownUnder @SenatorCardin @POTUS @EPA 

Solar Minimum, MCE minimal, Sun Spot Minimum. Marunder Minimum Probable.
Now that is something to worry about, Global cooling! Less food, etc
If Marunder goes on too long Dalton Minimum is major glacial period. 100,000 yrs.
Tbis became more probable after 19 volcanoes in Oceanic rift erupted in Nov.
Sen. Cardin is not real. He and his "facts" are a product of his own imagination. :)
@SenSchumer @POTUS @EPA Senator Franken wrote about these clowns, in 'Lies and the Lying Liars that tell them!'  Fight Hard!
Get together with others in Congress and do an INTERVENTION! 
This man is mentally incompetent! 
Needs serious help!
PLEASE!!!
Climate change is real and caused by natural sun cycles documented  millennia before human activity.
Trump did NOT "fail to support" NATO. He suggested: #1 It needs modernization. #2 That members pay up!
And got rid of the entire top staff of the State Department! https://twitter.com/pharris830/status/824670479214456833 …
Only thing NP service should be tweeting about? How come use permits take 6 damn weeks for the grand canyon.
.@SenatorCardin .@POTUS .@EPA VOTE NO Betsy DeVos. NO Jeff Sessions.The president can't lead-the people will. #notmysecretary #ScienceMarch
He's my Senator...thank you!
@MollyJongFast @POTUS @EPA #climatefacts #environment
@realDonaldTrump is a pathological liar and a truly unstable reckless individual. I won't even call him a man.
Thank you. Gov't belongs to Americans. Continue to support open government. #DefendScience
He may silence you next We can only hope
- Denying reality does not change reality but does prevent us from making wise choices!
No longer a Maryland resident but damn our Senators are good!  @SenatorCardin
#DemandTransparency #freespeech #resist #TheResistance #WeThePeople #ThisIsntFunnyAnymore
he also silenced the spies that told us about his treason
My climate plan! I need everyone to open their windows and turn on the A/C. #climatechange #climatefacts
@HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP  @SenateDems YES!  We need u & yr House & Senate brothers & sisters 2 speak truth & fight
Silencing those who are putting out facts to save lives is considered #Unconstitutional #Climate
Scientific data through peer review it is called research, political review is called propaganda #sciencematters
.@SenatorCardin @POTUS @EPA You spelled BS big govt scam that O pushed wrong! Fact is the climate has changed as long as earth has existed!
did #illegals from #sancuarycities #baltimore and #silverspring vote you in #voterfraud #registered #identitytheft
Whose facts? There are other scientists that disagree and they were silenced by Obama administration.
this is garbage. You realize we CAN find the real data right? #climategate
did you wear a coat or jacket today to help keep you warm? I did. @epa @potus
as a Maryland Voter, thank you keep fighting Trump.
I'm so happy you're my Senator! Vote NO on DeVos and Sessions!
@ConnieN45988691 @EPA @AP

U should've thought of that when U helped @HillaryClinton & the Super Delagates Rig the Primaries!
Thank you.
@lacrossemom5 @SenatorCardin @POTUS @EPA Well... You see... That's because POTUS believes in his new ALTERNATE facts
.@SenatorCardin Incredible. Trumpers care more about Tribalism than facts pertinent to the Earth their children will inherit.
@POTUS @EPA
wishing you and your wife more perfect walks & hope the same for your children <3
Thanks, Senator, for standing strong on this issue. Please keep up the good work.
Trump is arrogant and ruthless. #ResistTrump
Tell your fellow Dems that are rubber-stamping Trump's picks to knock it off. That's part of problem!
Many people don't know why EPA came about. I worked in an industry that polluted.
My father died because of lack of OSHA.  So good air and water is a little personal to me.
Disgusting lie.
Climate skeptics have been silenced for decades, losing funding for researching the wrong facts.
Let scientists, engineers, and inventors come up with the solution with the people's help! Enable positive change
as soon as they explain why we are warming and cooling at the same rate as mars...real science
It's a people problem, not the small percentage of administration in America problem. The world is alive like us
Let the rest of the 7 billion people on the planet come up with a way to address climate change. Not the gov't!
Climate change isn't an administration topic with more focus than the obvious. The climate will always change.
@AmericanWhoaMan @POTUS @EPA YOU'D BETTER BE READY TO FIGHT!, NO WORKING WITH THE ADMIN, SCORCHED EARTH #ResistTrump
Please fight back and do not let this administration destroy our Republic.  @StandUpRepublic
Question, what are you doing about this????? #sonotright

@Diedre09 @POTUS @EPA He is just the front man for Bannon and Heritage Foundation
Thank you for this statement.
@Lauren13momo2 @POTUS @EPA @nolanotoole
National Parks Service, several parks and NASA have all established rogue accounts on Twitter.

The little shitbird was included deliberately as an insult to his fragile ego. He HATES...
Without Science we will go back hundreds of years Medicine tech goods space Electric everything
Is there no chance to stop him? 
I fear that the world is going to war.
@SenSchumer @POTUS @EPA no one should be silenced. THIS IS AMERICA. Where is 1st amdmnt?They are OUR employees not DT servant
This has been happening in Australia for decades. BoM & CSIRO, Climate Council all gagged.

@SenSchumer @POTUS @EPA So what are you doing about it? Besides confirming all his nominees???? All talk no action. Typicla

Keep information free flowing and remain a democracy!
The Climate is controlled by God ! Man made climate change is about control #climatefacts #communism
Pls make bill again to ensure @POTUS won't freely touch NUCLEAR button; @realDonaldTrump can't control himself, dangerously
Please don't forget today's @StateDept news. As an advocate for the civil service, we'd love to hear your voice
@S Get YOUR Thumb--OUT OF YOUR REAR POSTIER--Before Feces Hits the Rotating Oscillator. America Is Waiting--Do Your Damn Job!

Thank you for your support and the truth Senator. tRump is a delusional traitor and should be removed from office
@SenSchumer @POTUS @EPA Can you say commy.
Democrats are to facts as fish are to bicycles.
Not so much. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/01/24/gagged-not-hardly/ …
Thank you for standing up for the truth! #DefendScience #ResistTrump
do you know how the scientific method works? LOL.. data manipulation at it's finest
Thank you Mr Prez
What facts ... you can't control Mother Nature ...
@SenSchumer Please fight to protect our climate and our right to speak out. Thank you.
oh you mean the "alternative facts"?  They are only facts when you & your ilk agree with the data
Is this because Obama funded fake climate control agencies??
Yet senate Dems keep voting yes for his regime picks. Find your spine or the Dem Party will be left behind. #resist
@SenSchumer @POTUS @EPA 
Can you guarantee everything posted is absolutely irrefutable?Do Government Agencies set policy now?
oh it's so funny watching you guys squirm. Hey wasn't the world supposed to be ended by now? #algore
Independent voters are watching this confirmation process closely. You're on the right side of history.Great job!
Polar ice caps r melting on Mars..we need to ban SUV's, industrial coal plants, and cow farts there. #CLEANMARS
it's Leo DiCaprio visiting ET on mars with his leer jet.
@SenSchumer @EPA then why are Dem Senators voting aye on ANY trump cabinet picks? They work to put terrible policies in place
Maybe some cabinet picks aren't the worst?
The agencies & departments are running open loop.  Confirm the cabinet heads.  "Elections have consequences"
