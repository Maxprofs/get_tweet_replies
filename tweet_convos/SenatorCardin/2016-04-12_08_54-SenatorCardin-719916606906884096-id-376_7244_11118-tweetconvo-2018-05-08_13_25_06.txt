@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS it should definitely be equal. It always should've been. We deserve it. We work our ass off #EqualPayDay
@dinahjauregxi  @LaurenJauregui @POTUS  You don't get STEM degrees,  and your always taking maternity leave.  #EqualPayDay #myth
@Isa268100001 @LaurenJauregui @POTUS maternity leave? I'm 17, in full time education, single and gay lmao. I work as a cleaner after school
@dinahjauregxi @Isa268100001 @LaurenJauregui @POTUS so how much less per hour do you get paid than your male coworkers?
@schley_guy @Isa268100001 @LaurenJauregui @POTUS I'm lucky because my school are fair and I get equal pay, but not everywhere is equal
@dinahjauregxi show me one place that pays women less for the same job.  This #EqualPayDay #myth is based on LIFETIME earnings, dumb bitch.
@Isa268100001 call me a dumb bitch when you're actually correct next time :)
@dinahjauregxi ok first pic.  Men work 27% harder and longer therefore get paid 27% more.
Just because you (@WhiteHouse @POTUS ) keep repeating it doesn't make it real. If women were cheaper than men no one would hire men!
@bashpr0mpt @WhiteHouse @POTUS they typically are, but men still get hired more often, how do you explain that?
@MoonHarvest1 @bashpr0mpt @WhiteHouse @POTUS well it explains that the gap is fake.
@schley_guy @MoonHarvest1 I was addressing that @WhiteHouse @POTUS are repeating a debunked lie / misinfo that's been thoroughly exposed.
@bashpr0mpt @MoonHarvest1 @WhiteHouse @POTUS well in politics if you repeat a lie enough it becomes truth. Sadly.
@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS it almost sounds stupid how this isn't a thing already
@dimplesregui @WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS equal pay is a thing. And has been for 40 years.

@scooterjudy @POTUS And jobs that are historically held by #women should not be devalued in our economy.

@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS Yes equal pay for equal work.....shame still debating it -21st century- yet not implementing it!
@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS agree with you Sir
@WhiteHouse @POTUS people just want to be paid for just showing up and not doing any work. WORRK is the operative word.
@WhiteHouse @LaurenJauregui @POTUS my humble opinion is -presidents aren't taken seriously like they used to be.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I support that idea sir, and you are right about immigration the twelve tribes are here sir! Thank you! Awesome!
@WhiteHouse Equal pay should be a top priority.

@WhiteHouse @POTUS too bad it can't be retroactive
@WhiteHouse @POTUS it is ILLEGAL to pay women less. They EARN less because they dont work the same hours. Who pays women less? Be specific

Today is #EqualPayDay. WATCH @TheBlazeHotList (Amy Holmes) bust the gender pay gap myth.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS I'm more concerned that employers got rid of all non-management full time positions in reaction to the #AffordableCareAct
@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS yep. Equal pay for all. Yep
@WhiteHouse @POTUS there never was a gap. its just a reason to argue with this socialist divisive BS. the country is ruined
@WhiteHouse @POTUS women are favored 95% of the time in child support/alimony payments and earn 40 times more than men in sexuality jobs.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS. Should start with the white house and his administration
@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS Women are powerful and deserve to be treated that way! #EqualPayDay
@WhiteHouse @kerrywashington @POTUS Of course!

@WhiteHouse @Kalaax008 @POTUS why should a poorly performing teacher make the same (or more) than a poorly performing teacher? #EqualPayDay
@bobcotte @WhiteHouse @POTUS That's a totally different situation not based on gender
@Kalaax008 @WhiteHouse @POTUS No 2 people have same skill set. Cant regulate =pay without negating skill and work ethics provided by some
@WhiteHouse @Kalaax008 @POTUS if you want equal pay for equal work, join a union other wise, pay for performance is better.  #TwoPaths
@WhiteHouse @UUtah @POTUS nope... Equal pay for equal results. Results are what matter.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS equal pay for equal work strengthens our economy

@WhiteHouse @POTUS I am trying to go to college to get that equal pay.. I want to be a nurse. I have 5000 due. If I don't pay I can't return
@WhiteHouse @POTUS A woman has to go to college to get equal pay.  It's as simple as that. Men have the strength to perform jobs w good pay
@WhiteHouse @TheEllenShow @POTUS Agreed
