@mcspocky I used to think people had an obvious incentive to want to protect clean water, not so obvious after all I guess.
Soros' pets have no credibility, Ben.
soros behind the protests and  violence
this is denial talking. The protestors are like you and me, just expressing their views
Speak for yourself, Rebecca.  The protesters are either paid or useful idiots who trust the corporate media.
that's an alternate fact
Alternate facts?  Oh, you mean the corporate media ...
you believe Briebart ? You need only check your sources to know what's real. No need to close your eyes and ears
You're deflecting, Rebecca.
Trump helps friends pollute our clean water. Ruin our children's future  for corporate greed
@jayvandy dated story but still relevant. Ask your colleagues if they'd drink this water?

@Ash10222 There will hell to pay when downstream communities have contaminated drinking water.  That will be on GOP.
I'm sure all value clean water! You really are a mean person. Tell us who wants their family to drink dirty water? Stop lies
this is pretty naive. It's money that makes policy, sad but true
what recourse do we have now?
Save our water!
@mistyclifton can we ban bottled water from congress?
Nice idea. Would force congress to do something about ensuring clean, public tap water.
Fresh air and clean water.. try living without it.
please continue to fight back against these terrible actions!
agreed!
@WeNeededHillary ABSOLUTELY DUMBFOUNDED that @GOP & @SpeakerRyan don't even want clean water for AMERICANS!
@skyclad_dancer WTH is going on with your colleagues on that DAMN HILL
@WeNeededHillary I guess it depends on who's paying you
Rs don't care abt the peop who elected them, nor clean air & water. Only mining, cattle, oil, & other bus that give them $$$
#GOP_Spectre is a terrorist organization being treated as legitimate officials.
@WeNeededHillary Thank for seeing the insanity. Even the downtrodden coal miner would want his child to drink clean water.
You actually think?
What was the reason to overturn the stream protection.
Dems had better pick sides: either the ppl or ur Corp $Sugar Daddy Donors$. LABOR HAS NO REPRESENT. Dems face primary chall
Please, RESIST with all your might! And believe me, as a Maryland constituent, we'll back you up.
The modern GOP wants the people to die from a lack of healthcare and clean drinking water, not a lack of ammo.
keep fighting senator! We are behind you!
Trump administration won't be happy until our country is trashed, drilled dry, with polluted water and air we can't breath.
Resist for US, Sir. WE and history are watching.
@bellablue1060, Sen Cardin keep fighting and say "no" to Gorsuch-eight is enough!
What the FUUUUUK?!!!@HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
@MaddowBlog Money Trump's people's health. How many people will die because of no clean air or water?
@MaddowBlog Trumpy figure out a way for people to breath coal dust and drink oil? Few jobs for clean water and air? Thanks.
thank you for intent to vote no CWA
I started alerting enviro groups I belong to last night,this is a disaster-watch cancer and leukemia rates rise again
unreal!
that's because these people dont drink from the same taps.
what can we do to fight this?
Vote them out in 2018, and 

FIRE THE LIARS
IMPEACH TRUMP NOW!
U have to remember that this President also thinks climate change is a hoax. We moved from MD to WI. Wish u were still my Sen
insanity
I guess Mr. Watt will be proud. @SenatorCardin @NormOrnstein
@RepMikeBishop Even from Michigan!
if #StreamProtectionRule overturned can you introduce rule that allows #wethepeople to dump our waste in Mining CEOs yard?
@GurrdyGirl
-- thank you for your strong stands against the destruction of our environment. Keep fighting. We're behind you all the way.
This is absolutely terrible.  We don't need coal debris in our water!
If you or others are being forced to vote yes, against your will, wear red pins so you an be saved from this mad man.
work against it block by any means possible.
@MatterFeminist Your faith in the intelligence and/or compassion of your brethren is misplaced. #staymad #resist #Indivisible
Thank you for support efforts to keep our environment clean
agreed
@senrobportman @SenSherrodBrown Oil/mining  shld use $ 2 create (!) jobs in renewable. Don't understand, drink dirt water?
We need Congress to stand up to these attempts at env deregulation. You have our support and we won't quiet our voice
RESIST!
@mdnastyactivist they're lost all sense of decency. Keep fighting.  MD is with you
do u mean #WOTUS? Not sure y ur not using actual name. Talk to ur ag constituents about our concerns than blanket tweets.
taking over private property because there a pond is WRONG!  You want a centralized government - we don't!!
Then move. It is the UNITED STATES not the states.
Enough of this lunacy. We must have clean water. tRump must be removed frm office. American lives are at risk. #ImpeachTrump
all Americans should file lawsuits for threat to our lives #ExxonKnew #russiagate
This is the first intelligent thing I have seen come from your twitter account. Congratulations!!
@MaddowBlog what the heck is go n on with the GOP ? Have they forgotten who voted 4 them? They r supposed to make life better
They haven't forgotten anything. They just don't care about anything that doesn't line their pockets. 

apparently white working class of rural america can do w/o clean water, "good luck & fu!" from @gop & @realDonaldTrump #maga
I just moved to MD and I am very happy to see your stance.
@MaddowBlog Frms please stand up!!!!
right?
If I remember right, didn't you Dems kick this can down the road before? Gotta keep up with Chucky and his rhetoric.
@MaddowBlog  this will hurt the coal mining trump voters. But I guess if they don't have to drink the water then....
@MaddowBlog GUESS ALL THOSE IN RUST BELT AND COAL MINING STATES WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP CAN LOOK FORWARD TO DRINKING TOXIC WATER
@MaddowBlog you forgot we're talking about the Republican party. $$$$$$$$$$$$$
@MaddowBlog @peffowlkes  makes me think of Erin Brockovich offering the water to PG&E executive
why don't you pull an Erin Brockovich. Bring dirty flint water and ask them to drink a bottle before they vote!
that's actually a decent idea or let them drink it and tell them afterwards
Shit, I mean have you seen flint ?
indeed. Can we trust Big Coal to protect the communities they pillage?
Do something about it then! How about some Democratic unity, instead of appeasing Trump? GET A SPINE! #resist
@JacekJasinski  What the hell is wrong with our Fucking congress! We need clean air and water. Your greed is not sustainable!
Their greed is sustainable,  life isn't.  Think they care? NOT.
@MaddowBlog does that mean you gonna take care of flint??
@MaddowBlog Senator Cardin, thank you for speaking out.  We need clean water.
@MaddowBlog  trump and company are ruining our land,water,air,children and will leave our country without resources
That's the plan.
Totally agree. Soon we will all have cancer and other environmentally caused illnesses because you know, regulation is bad.
some of your colleagues like to bathe in money.
Relax.  The Koch brothers will have plenty of clean water to drink. There is no need to be alarmed...
THEN STOP TRUMP
join me. I'm a social worker organizing as a grassroots effort.

I don't know how you would ever think that, considering a majority of the Senate wants to burn the world down.
@MaddowBlog U would think they value clean air n food, safe working conditions 4 American workers. All they care about is $$$
@MaddowBlog Bye bye Mountaineers. It's been a slice.
@MaddowBlog I'm not surprised they don't value masses having clean water. Example is #FlintWaterCrisis
what are you going to do about it? time to act on your regret.
@MaddowBlog 
Try living in WV!
What makes U think they value clean water? 
Look what they'd nominate & approve, to head the EPA.
Vote NO on Trump noms, Ben!
@MaddowBlog At a certain point, can we just admit that some people are evil? I guess Flint, MI, has "good enough" water, too?
@MaddowBlog the rich think as long as they got  everything is ok they can drink & breathe  I hope they drowned in it
@MaddowBlog so is your voting yes to any more Trump cabinet nominations
Anything to make a buck and enhance the bottom line - no scruples.
@MaddowBlog no surprise really - they shut down  #FlintWaterCrisis w/no action
I think some of that has 2 do w/ Trip "THEY" made to Alaska - Some "Gold Mine" areas? Not sure +H2O was a Key
Know any Dems in Alaska? I read they made a tour of the areas and some water rights or EPA issues came up.
Sarah Palin...Donated "BIGLY" to His Campaign...Oh, and the Oil...Don't forget Drilling! hmmm
@MaddowBlog why would you think that? repubs don't care about the environment. They only care about themselves.
@MaddowBlog clean water won't increase his (their) wealth.  War will ,their planning it as we speak.
Thank you sir! Looks like we will have a few battles to fight this year! 
@altUSEPA @AltEPA 
#cleanwater matters .
and when the ACA is gone, where will they get care from their environmental maladies?  Will Trumpcare cure their Trumpitis?
@MaddowBlog then do something about it!  You're a US Senator!
I guess they drink bottled water only from plastic bottles.  Thank you for your service
Remember in the preamble to the Constitution the nod to posterity?  That is no longer relevant.
Does the Senate get a vote on this?
remove environmental regulations.  repeal health care. what could possibly go wrong?
You got 'em there! Dirty water protectionists!
@MaddowBlog this country has totally gone off the deep end. Frightening to say the least
.@SenatorCardin "Let them drink dirt!!" - GOP
with a coal on the side.
@MaddowBlog Oh they enjoy liquid alright. Just the kind that clings when dropped
PLEASE don't repeal the #StreamProtectionRule. Disaster. Counting on you.
.@SenatorCardin I used to think a lot of things that not longer appear to be true
Resist "alternative" reality.  Stay strong.
Respond accordingly.
We MUST #ImpeachTrump
Any without a spine epidemic among Republicans, how? Dems hold; we PRESSURE/SUPPORT. Congress must hold.
I don't remember Ivanka describing this in her list of "passions" that she was going to work on: Coal filled streams? Ick.
You would have zero policies enacted without Lying to sell them
@NormOrnstein maybe not the Congressmen in Michigan
why are they overturning?   Just because or??  pls dont stop fighting...it appears that is the only way...dear Lord.
Dems and any remaining reasonable GOP members  need to do something - what will we tell our kids?!
Tell them to put their shoes on and get ready to go for a long march.
I would think they wouldn't sell out education for campaign contributions. I was also wrong #richardmakesaaronlookgood
You wouldn't believe how bad WI schools sre!
Stop Trump or be replaced
that's great. Voting to poison the very same voters who elected them. Profits above people! Party alliegance over country!
25th Amendment, Article 4. Learn it, Love it, Work towards it.
LIVE IT! When can they start proceedings
Maybe I'll change that to 'Enact it'? Thoughts on that?
yes!
Thanks for the feedback - please share the comment :)
I already did, thanks!!
