Listen to local officials directions for updates on actions to take during and after Tropical Storm #Nate. http://www.ready.gov/hurricanes  
Unless the facts are inconvenient or make us look bad then we will remove that information.   Thanks @potus.

It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.
Please give us statistics on state of Puerto Rico: state of water and electricity, food supplies a d infrastructure etc.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse
Where are the thousands of people you rescued not a single word from all those people?
If you're in the path of #Nate, please don't rely on @fema to rescue you. Organize with your neighbors for post storm rescue. #PuertoRico

MAGA! From a Puerto Rican!
To gente se estan muriendo de hambre.. MAGA
Brock from FEMA yes U have made some progress in Puerto Rico but why aren't u going into the villages not only bigger cities ppl r waiting
Will you delete the page if it doesn’t fit the narrative like you did for Puerto Rico?

Until you delete them at @realDonaldTrump orders like you did on stats for #PuertoRico
