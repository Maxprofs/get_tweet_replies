.@SpeakerRyan do the right thing
.@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Because they don't want Obama to get credit for anything?  Heroes aren't political footballs!
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr oh man that is heartbreaking.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr #WorstResponders are you kidding?! This is blowing my mind! Thank you @TheDailyShow for informing us!
@TheDailyShow @beccagrawl @SenateMajLdr Beyond belief that we are having any issue with covering the costs of the care for first responders

@TheDailyShow the moment of zen in this one was pure tv brilliance
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr please help our first responders. Don't abandon those who help us in our darkest and most vulnerable times!
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr I cannot understand how any Congress person could deny first respondes needs. Greed and lazyness are my best bet
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr heartbreaking image, why doesn't this have full bipartisan support? Get this done now, campaigning can wait.
9/11 Responders Showed No Fear. #WorstResponders Show No Morals. @TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr @speakerryan

@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Why are democrats refusing to fund first responders in order to protect millionaires?!
#WorstResponders
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr  #WorstResponders
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr -- A nation that refuses to take care of its ailing heroes has neither honor or dignity #WorstResponders
@TheDailyShow @laurihendler @SenateMajLdr Pass the act so everyone can be with their families for the holidays.
@TheDailyShow @spaceguy87 @SenateMajLdr this is seriously sad and pathetic. There is no excuse in the world.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr #SHAME
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr    It's only human to help the 1st responders of 9/11 who are dying #itsOnlyHuman #stopHypocracy #justice #love
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr why does someone have to come out of "retirement" to get congress to do the RIGHT thing? #worstresponders
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Pass it!
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr #WorstResponders
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Unbelievable that we have to ask for this.
So wonderful to see #JonStewart back on @TheDailyShow, but for such a heartbreaking reason. @SenateMajLdr you are a despicable human being
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr  no brainer, so Sen. McConnell is having trouble with it
@TheDailyShow @sarinah_moon sad
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Do the right thing.

@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr This. If you dont support 1st response, drs, scientists, & troops after what message do you send?
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Very, very sad image.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Better late than never, but sad nothing was done sooner. The political bickering and bigotry killing heroes.
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr this picture is absolutely heartbreaking.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr How can anyone look at that photo and not want to help? Are you waiting for the rest of them to die?
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr this breaks my heart, please do the right thing Senator!
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr cowardice is what Is happening here. For the record,  he pulled this stunt before.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr This image breaks my heart. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan must pay attention. #TheyGaveEverything #ZadrogaAct
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr and yet, all @twitter lets me do now is "love" this.  There is no loving this.
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr that's McConnell's twitter handle? What'll they do when they lose the seat?
@TheDailyShow @Takahata101 @SenateMajLdr the fact that this is even being questioned is unacceptable
@TheDailyShow Yes, thank you 4 posting the 2 pics together so I can tell @SenateMajLdr. Stop being among the #WorstResponders. Bring vote!
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr I always loved Kentucky but now, thanks to you and rand Paul, I think it sucks. #WorstResponders
@SenateMajLdr You, a failed leader of idiots, an empty windbag of shortsighted hate, have earned my complete contempt.  @TheDailyShow
@TheDailyShow GOP claims2support/praise Troops/1st responders but don't lift a finger2continually support heroes of 9/11 in Congress.
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr This upsets me greatly but neither surprises or amazes me.  Doing nothing is a hard job.
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr  First responders are unsung heroes. Let's make sure they're taken care of. #WorstResponders
@TheDailyShow wow. @SenateMajLdr
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr #ClintEastwood these chairs needed the 9/11 Zadroga Act to be passed; http://www.ryanike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/empty_chairs_audience.bmp …
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr The other three died? Oh.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr you dare say #NeverForget911? Help our heroes NOW!
Dear @SenateMajLdr please pass  the #ZadrogaAct first responders-THEY RAN IN WHEN OTHERS RAN OUT! HELP THEM NOW! @TheDailyShow @willmarfuggi
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr We can't give them benefits because Islamism isn't at war against the west or USA. Just terror.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Are ANY politician's constituents AGAINST this? Can even 1 politician say that the people they represent say no?
@mmonogram @TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr No one is against it. Dems are refusing to fund first responders in order to protect millionaires.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr This embarrasses me as a person
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Man, if only they handed you boxes of money like the people you create tax breaks for, then it would happen.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr Senate: "Indeed, they are..." *grin*
@TheDailyShow @wilw @SenateMajLdr Heartbreaking.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr you only seem to be able to find the money easily when it's to kill people not save them. #WorstResponders
@TheDailyShow @TheMurdochTimes @SenateMajLdr They need to pass this bill as a matter of urgency. Shame on politicians.
@TheDailyShow @SenateMajLdr help first responders now.  Please
