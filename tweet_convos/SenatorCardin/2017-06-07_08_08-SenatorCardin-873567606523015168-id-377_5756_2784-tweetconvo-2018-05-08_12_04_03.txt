We have to do our duty.  Everybody needs to phone their two senators.  Other staff can hear the phones up and down the hall.
Precisely why I'm running against Mitch in 2020. I propose mandatory simplicity, transparency & accountability on all legislation. #CoxforKY
Simplicity - All bills must be presented in plain English in the simplest form possible.
Transparency - All legislation should bill easily accessible to the public before it can be voted upon.
Accountability - Treat the misrepresentation of legislation as the highest form of purgury.
I guess its okay2 ram a bill down throats of the American people w/o debate,hearings or mark-ups. Wasn't OK B4,but that was then
call the help committee members & demand a copy & transparency
The HELP committee is handling the ACHA. Call the number above & say their state to get to their office https://www.help.senate.gov/about/members  https://twitter.com/DavidNather/status/874288693242191875 â€¦
that  A-HOLE!! Who does he think he IS? HE doesn't care, he's out anyway and will NEVER be elected again- why should he care?
Good!
no, or... https://youtu.be/6KF-SgEj5lw?t=9  With a little help from my #AbFab friends 
Further if McConnell hopes to pass tax breaks to richest based on loss of ACA to working class families, he'll lose the Senate for sure.
McConnell threatens his majority. Let him do it and lose majority in '18.
It times to repeal and not replace with anything Health insurance is not a right.it your job to take care of your family not the fed gov
Consensus is the Senate won't pass...fingers crossed
This Resistance is going to be up to other states than Virginia & California. Maine, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio call ur Senators.
Call 202-224-3121 don't sit & complain. Actions speak louder. I called yesterday I have the worst Sen @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake 
#resist
GOOD!
Bastards! is there no end to their duplicitiousness?
Yes, let's separate the wheat from the chaff and the so-called patriots from those who are distractors... now get your asses behind ACA !!!
@indivisibletxjc are U @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz going to attend funerals 4 those that lose their healthcare @IndivisibleTeam
Start talking about @SenateMajLdr 's corrupt Russian connections - he's complicit
@GOP must be stopped. Where are the whistleblowers? I refuse to believe that The United States Constitution doesn't prevent such action.
Traitor to American values.
People, call and write and protest this now!
I can't believe they're gonna actually do it. This is crazy.
right
The GOP are using smoke from trump's many fires to cover up their anti democratic chicanery to cut the rich's taxes at the expense of all.
#Republicans #TrumpUnite2020 @POTUS #TrumpTrain #Persist #MAGA
@POTUS #TrumpTrain #Persist #MAGA
@SenateMajLdr @GOP trying to force thru any evil they can before @POTUS resigns.  All despicable.
Back to work people! Do not let McConnell fast track horrible AHCA bill!
GOP will be *toast* in 2018 for this.
I so despise McConnell.  Thanks Kentucky for thrusting this schmoo on our country yet again.
What's rule 14
Feck.
@robportman seriously Senator? You & your colleagues are that anxious to serve the rich & kill the poor just to screw the ACA?
McConnell is evil
I wonder if @SenateMajLdr has this flag hanging up in his house? #racistMitch #MITCHMKKKONNELL
Dirty @GOP at it again. CALL, CALL, CALL
So freaking underhanded. A big blatant "screw you" to the American people. They are so evil.
They have to rush things through before the president and party fall in 2018
AHCA will result in death and dismemberment of Americans. All for tax handouts to the rich. Tell your senator to oppose!
Citizens United and the Koch Brothers destroying our democracy.
This would be a great time for a few Republican Senators to switch their party and take the Senate back from Mercer, Koch, & Putin.
Yep.  I get to be the weirdest POTUS ever & they get 2 undo the New Deal. IDC.  I don't like Walmart types. Well, from a distance they r OK.
so, McCain can't be coherent at the hearing, but now he's pushing for Rule 14??? or did this happen before today's hearing?
@SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @DickDurbin @SenWarren @SenMarkey @timkaine @SenFeinstein @ChrisCoons @SenWhitehouse -take care of @SenateMajLdr
Of that 1 we need, Sullivan, Heller, Gardner are probably best bets but Portman, Capito and Cassidy should all be called 24/7
They still need 51 votes and Mitch apparently says Murkowski and Collins are no votes meaning we need 1 more.
Call these Senators 24/7
Guys everyone needs to call their senators and voice your opinion. These people will take our Healthcare. Give the profits to the rich
So all this Comey stuff is a distraction that helps the GOP take our country away from us. When will we officially become a dictatorship?
Wtf is going on?! Is anyone representing the citizens of this country anymore?
On behalf of my fellow Kentuckians, I'd like to apologize to the nation for mcconnell. I promise, I've never voted for that clown. Hate him!
When #MAGA shitkickers come off gumment disability & #Medicaid, they're going to howl like stuck piglets. #sorrygrandma @GOP killed mommy.
Call your Senators! They're trying to sneak this through. RT! Get the word out
@SenatorTomUdall @MartinHeinrich .
Hence the reason for Russian interference in the 1st place.America's aware so they are racing to get things through b4 they are shut down.
I can't wait to see that dirtbag @SenateMajLdr lose his seat and HOPE to see him prosecuted in the coming maelstrom 
Any open discussion on the bill? Is there a process for feedback (fr healthcare pros & public ? Previous bill was debated for a year  !
@SenatorBurr: while we know you have enjoyed showboating in the #ComeyHearing, we're watching your actions regarding our health.
That will end well. And unread bill fast tracked by the review body. @t_magennis think you are in the middle of a coup.
Desperate to pass something! Who cares if 24 million lose insurance
I thought gop senators said they wouldn't vote on the house bill.  That it would be deliberative and take about a year.
Don't u understand?    Democracy is dead.
@SenMajLeader McConnell is going to devastate the state of KY. We already have senior couples who take turns getting meds every other month.
#GOP is digging their own grave -
So, what do we do if we live in a state like Fl where freaking Marco Rubio is a senator??
Wow they really gonna shoot themselves in his head.
@SenateMajLdr has destroyed the Senate not that he cares. All he sees is tax cuts for the rich & the chance to stick it to the people
@GOP @SenateMajLdr Shame 4 putting your hateful agenda before what is best for the MAJORITY of citizens and 4 selling out our country.
.@OFA never underestimate the disgusting ability of Sen. McConnell to cheat the American people on #Obamacare.
Ahem, @KamalaHarris and @SenFeinstein I expect you both to BURN THE BUILDING DOWN before you let a bill like this pass.
Time to get on the phone! DON'T be distracted!
What happened to writing their own bill?
As horrible as many GOPs are, McConnell is the most horrendous soulless monster of them all
Called both my Senators today!  NO repeal -  STRENGHTEN Obamacare!!!
When is it going on the calendar what's the date ?
Look over here at #ComeyTestimony & the @GOP destroys Healthcare over here when nobody is watching.  #sad
The GOP plans to blast #TrumpCare through while people are distracted by Comey! Come on, folks. Call. Write. Scream to save ACA!
Who exactly are they passing this stuff for, themselves?The rich? 

It's certainly not to help regular citizens. 

@sahilkapur @bethsinni21
No hearings, no info on bill. Just vote. This is what one would expect in Russia. Not the United States. Guess democracy quickly on way out
Because fast tracking one of the largest, most expensive pieces of legislation has always worked out well. Both parties included.
Cuz @SenateMajLdr knows it's about to go down for trump and his cronies and they need to pass shit fast
Another attempt to "Nuke" the Senate. 

#resist
Yup. Weasel Mic!
@SenateMajLdr do anything to distract from  testimony of James Comey. Including screwing #women #poor #elderly and #minorities
While US is watching the magician's diversion (DJT) GOP is driving AHCA through. DJT and side show are useful for GOP Ldrs.
What is Rule 14
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!
The GOP are living out their dream of squashing Medicaid  while destroying ACA.
I thought it was DOA?
We need to keep our eyes on the True Sneaky Treasonists, Ryan and McConnell!! Ryan now has a challenger, he betting on VP job!
@Sifill_LDF #ComeyHearing #voted #democracy #VoteCorbyn #Attention !!!! @DNC
This is why R's say nothing. While Trump sucks oxygen out of room, the Turtle pushes 2 complete legislative wet dream despite unpopularity.
AHCA can only pass by cheating.Which is way @GOP  @realDonaldTrump @RNC got the majority. Gerrymandering,voter suppression,mob$.
this GOP needs to be voted out in 2018--what they are doing is inhuman...none of the are working for the citizens
Dueling 2the death: Healthcare & Frank Dodd bust ups v Comey testimony=WHlot burn? All bust....
Where are the DEM Leaders? Too focus on Russia. Please RESIST & STOP corrupt GOPs from jamming Healthcare! Wake Up, Watch Out 4 our healthC
@SenatorTomUdall @MartinHeinrich you will vote no on any form of the ACHA bill, correct? It will hurt millions of New Mexicans
AHCA
That is what the Dems are worried about.

Everyone should watch and share this heartbreaking @dscc ad on the GOP health care bill over and over. 
While USA peeps watch the constitution turn to dust,GOP members put the final nail in our coffin's behind close door in middle of the night
McConnell is an asshole. Calling him a turtle is an insult to turtles
Vote all repugs out! Medicare for 55 & over; then 5 years later 45 > then 5 y later 35>. Etc until all covered. Take away cap on MC to fund
Hurry! Pass something before Trump gets run straight outta town! We won't let it happen.
Good. We were all getting tired of having health insurance. We'll be much happier if Trump and the 1% pay less tax instead. #wealthcare
Which confirms how pathetic he is.
I can see them rubbing their hands
US is Russia now.

Putin is in power.
Sneaky Pete strikes again
Let's not get distracted. More pleasure in watching Trump panic re Comey testimony.
How many f*ng rules are there that the turtle drags out? It seems like there is one for every bill so there is never any business as usual.
.@realDonaldTrump  we will NOT allow you to shove this tax cut down our throats while you pretend it's healthcare. #ShowUsTheBill
We see the criminals. If they are traitors, doesnt ANYTHING they try to do become illegal and unconstitutional? REMOVE the republicant reps.
What happened to them working on their own bill from scratch? Oh right, "healthcare is complicated" so we'll just use the House's garbage.
It will never see the light of day.
Sneaky. He's not hiding Rule 14, it's the timing. Eyes open, all! They will shut down and throw away all the good things if we look away.

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, @GOP  will let the Motherfucker Burn !
Burning down the house, the country and the citizens! From the ashes republicans will rule!
No problem we'll just vote them out in 2018.  By then we will not be able to vote. GOP changing state voter laws every day.
They sure do act like people who can't be voted out!

We gotta stop this NOW!!!!
Gotta hurry before Trump goes bye, bye...last chance to shaft the poor an middle class and $$ 2 the wealthy.. gotta hurry.. GOP loathsome!!!
Dear @BuzzFeedNews @npr @nytimes @TriCityHerald @chicagotribune please provide more coverage on this! #TrumpCare
Another instance of @SenateMajLdr using this process during the previous administration
ResistBot & call your MOC
#TheResistance
What happened to the senate tossing the house's #ACA to write their own? Panicking because 45 is on his way out?@tedcruz @JohnCornyn WTH?
You ridiculous, small men of the GOP: you will kill people and you do not care.
Jesus...I hear the drums of revolt beating in the distance
THIS is a CODE red TWEET 
RESIST  THE rumps TRUMP ragtime 
Hit the phones peeps
Get busy PEEPS
He has to be stopped.
If Senate passes any of that bill, there will be riots.
Oh NO  NO  NO  NO  NO  NO PLEASE GOD NO.
.@GOP @SenateGOP you pass this and I'll make it my life's duty to destroy your corrupt "conservative" party.
RESIST!!!
Mitch must really think Trump is fast tracking his lame duck status.
when does CBO score come out?
Really bad they would do this. Mercers, Kocks, Putin, Exxon and  billionaires, oligarchs/mobsters and republicans  have hijacked my country.
Well if the AHCA, I will most likely not be able to afford insurance next year. Too many pre-existing conditions  would increase premium.
@SenBookerOffice @SenSchumer @POTUS44 stop @SenateGOP from passing AHCA & wasting our $.  Changes yes, repeal/replace no.  Let's vote out !
@SenShelby @lutherstrange Do not trade away my family's health for political gain. The AHCA is cruel, short-sighted, awful. Vote NO!
Fingers crossed! Fast-track for losing House & Senate majorities in 2018, then impeach!
Hey @johncusack @jonfavs @JohnLeguizamo, let's make sure the AHCA nightmare doesn't get passed "under the table" while distracted w/ Russia!
This is so scary. It's like a horror movie.

GO RIGHT AHEAD. We'll all get hit by it & be suffering anyway; but do it now so we're REALLY feeling it in time for the midterms.
Contact your Senators ASAP to say no to Rule 14 and AHCA. McConnell plans to put the Republican health care act on the fast track.
@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Had a chance to see & carefully read this? I don't want to hear "I have not read it"
while you were distracted today...
On his head be it.
But her emails!!
What the hell
Republicans are just evil
This is why Rs need Trump. He creates noise while they destroy ACA and other things.
While the Trump scandal takes everyone's attention, scoundrels like @SenMajLdr are silently imposing their rotten, repugnant agenda.
Oh boy, the citizens of Kentucky is going to be in for a rude awakening when they have to kiss their Kynect buh-bye.
.@marcorubio Please don't allow this to happen. Floridians deserve the chance to truly understand this bill, including a full CBO. #noRule14
Obviously fast track it before Trump gets impeached & world finds out Trump/Pence are fake ticket in office!
This is because all anyone has talked about since it passed the house is Russia - giving them plenty of cover

Sneaky sneaky GOP-y.
On behalf of Kentucky, I apologize.
I feel you. Burr embarrasses NC just as much.
We are in this together!
My senator Rubio will do and vote as told. Rubio always says PARTY BEFORE COUNTRY. Politicians before constituents
It won't pass is my guess.
RT RT RT
ALL HANDS! NOTHING works as effectively as calling:

CONGRESS MAIN LINE:
202-225-3121

Senate 866-985-2543
House 866-948-8977
We are here to make the $uper Rich, richer and the poor to die without health insurance.
#GOP 
#AHCA
#kremlinklan
I have to do it. Sorry. Are those quotes or inches?
bunch of MOFOs
Nothing. To. See. Here.
Good gawd, folks ...  this is very, very serious.
@McConnellPress @SenateMajLdr is a sneaky man. All Congress cares about is having AHCA & tax cuts passed.They're colluding w/Trump, in a way
Reality is @gop wants to see poor people dead while white rich people profit. It's as simple as that
My son & I both called all of the offices of our Sens & left messages. Also tweeted, fb'd & emailed.
@Deanofcomedy Is the AHCA being put on fast track?
Not much we can do in MA. Warren and Markey already oppose. We had it before US and will have it after. Thanks Romney!
I've put the Republicans on the fast track calendar to be voted out forever come 2018. Corruption at the highest level.
We have not even seen the bill they feel totay empowered to screw us over
wonder why they not concerned about next election. Is it fixed already?
There's a benefit for them that outweighs their burden. They're 5 steps ahead. When we figure it out--way too late.
I'm disheartened
#getyourfighton. This is subverting democracy for perm. control of gov't. While structure in place- put our people in.
very true
McConnell using Rule 14 to fasttrack #Trumpcare for vote. In just days #AHCA could pass! Take action w/ http://www.trumpcaretoolkit.org  . RETWEET!
@Lawrence @maddow @chrislhayes you all need to be talking about this!
