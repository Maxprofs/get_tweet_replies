The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!
Ben.  What do you suggest we do?
Talking is always better than war unless war is absolutely necessary.
@realDonaldTrump doesn't *have* aforeign policy, and even if he did, there's no one left at State to implement policy. Better start digging
#UnityNotHate send Donald Trump a mean tweet that's the solution. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
I'm quite sure #DPRK #NorthKorea hasn't used depleted uranium against anyone. Or killed 1000's with nuclear weapons. America? Well,.. yes
Well, too late for that seeing as we just paraded ourselves around the North Korean Peninsula, because that's gonna calm Kim down...
Trump cannot conduct foreign policy by any means. Senator, please get GOP colleagues to understand the grave threat he is to our safety.
If #KimJongUn is such a #SmartCookie as @realDonaldTrump praised him he would have a Twitter account. Solution is build #TrumpHotel in N.K.!
#UnityNotHate
Maybe if you worked with POTUS and got the rest of his cabinet installed he could focus on policy!
DJT has demonstrated that he will work with no one but himself, sabotaging any bipartisan efforts along the way.
25:4 this insane potus before he does something you can't stop.
So true. The thought of trump making these kinds of decisions is truly terrifying.
No Clinton giving them the nuclear capacity is the really terrifying part. Dems create the problems want the Republicans to solve them
And I absolutely do not want trump to try to solve the problem. He's incapable.
Look like Cardin Obama both bushes and Clinton wasn't able to solve your problem either
DJT's sabre rattling will get us nowhere except closer to the possibility of war. What a legacy DJT.
Senator he will get us all killed...help!
Haven't you been in Congress since North Korea has been acting badly & you want the President, Donald Trump, to listen to you, really?
Neither are nukes
I don't think our ambassador to the UN has been tweeting about it and she probably knows more about what is going on than you
diplomacy has failed us for the past 15 years, now we are about to be painted into a  corner
Wish there were more reasonable folk like you in Washington. This is really terrifying. Like chronic anxiety provoking.
@Potus tweets to keep his supporters informed because we can't believe anything coming out of Washington for years. #VoteThemOut
well that's what you get when you chose Hilary as the DNC candidate. now we have trump. Thanks Dems
Work with trump on health care and taxes
We have been "talking" all the way through 3 generations of despots running North Korea. United Nations "talking" since you were 6 years old
Oh stop it Ben. How long have you been in Congress 20 years no plan yet. He's just waiting for his pallet of cash like Obama gave Iran
What is your answer Ben. Apologize like obama did and bend over so they can screw us some more. All you do is obstruct. Please resign.
By the what is this your speaking On? Oh yeah, Twitter. Cut the crap.
He's talking   to us because the media and politicians lie. He's not making policy. That line is getting old.
Yes, DT work w/ Congress. There's a gang that shows brilliance at diplomacy & foreign policy. Conduct FP by Press Release instead of tweet.
Senator, stick to protecting Maryland crabs.
. BEN! POTUS ISN'T CONDUCTING FOREIGN POLICY ON TWITTER...YOU TWIT! As a @realDonaldTrump supporter I love hearing from my Pres via twitter!
Thank you, @SenatorCardin , for being a voice of reason.
Just how long do you want to "kiss ass"? If you're afraid, should be, but it's time to stand or roll over and submit!!
Well hell Twitter is totally diplomatic lmao

Cause working with Congress has proved to be an avenue to proceed with, the lack of leadership from these hacks has proven no leadership
countries that presume clinbton guilty get nuclear war. And there's nothing that parties who presume clinton guilty can do about it.
Can you please identify the people in North Korea that are a threat. Whole populations are not to blame for government personal decisions 
Says the man who during his campaign claimed he loves WAR
never having participated in one!
Dodged 5 times Spurs you know...
Busy September if you have to run the country, pass budget, debt ceiling, healthcare, impeachment trial
#TheResistanceIsaHateGroup funded by #Soros
Jesus, drumpf please take your snake pit of an administration, and...GO HOME.
A-freakin-men.  Just look at how well that's working out for you here at home @realDonaldTrump

Ears open for suggestions. We've had 50 plus years. The inevitable has only grown worse... Seriously, hit me with your best shot. Ears open.
Nice, seriously how long has Ben in Congress. Clinton created this problem now they want to push the blame on Trump. Liberals forget history
Thank you Senator.
@realDonaldTrump gets intelligence briefings from @FoxNews
Why is he so obsessed with extortion money?
Senator please speak with me I have reason in my voice anyone in the federal government knows who I am
No worries Cardin... POTUS knows what he's doing
Congress is useless. #DrainTheSwamp #MAGA
Trump no care of consequences doesn't think beyond the next lying tweet @POTUS
. SO SICK OF YOU PPL ACCUSING POTUS OF LYING! You kno...I've always heard, People that accuse others of lying are liars themselves!
I think Dirtball Don wants to treat North Korea like Melania - no talking but a lot of grabbing.

We should START with diplomacy
Armed conflict of any type should be the very very last resort
It has always been the policy. They escalate, we negotiate, they get rice, the end
Remember we now have a pentulant, spoiled, temper tantrum throwing child in the Whitehouse.
Will just impeach this incompetent fool already ?
Did you forget Trp won the election thru a http://tweet.Talk  is over.Talking heads don't work either
You're misinformed. Tweets are only part of POTUS's foreign pol. State department and the military conducting bulk of our foreign policy.
Oh that's great: @StateDept still has ~200 empty staff positions. We don't have an ambassador on the ground in S. Korea.
Trump is right and you know it.  How is our deal with the Iranian despots working out?  Oh yeah, they just denied our inspectors entry.  lol
Sad, the President needs this father figure, so do we.
Thank You @SenatorCardin. This man is endangering the United States.  Please consider Amendment 25.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump YOU HAD BETTER FUCKING LISTEN TO SENATOR CARDIN AND STOP FUCKING WITH OUR LIVES, YOU ARENT PLAYING MONOPOLY GAME!
You can't reason with crazy just like I can't reason with you! You got my waiver yet?
