Well say his name or you are no better. In fact, it makes you the cowards I know you are not.
He is prohibited from doing that. What Gen. Lengyel said here is perfect, and perfectly clear.
I did wonder about that and I feel so sorry for the position they have been placed in. Thanks for your tweet and the important clarification
Call him out by name or you're complicit
Thank you
need to go a step further & include donny trump's name in your comment.
@CNORichardson @GenRobertNeller @ArmyChiefStaff @GenDaveGoldfein
Thank U for standing w Joint Chiefs in denouncing racism & hate #Diversity
Thank you
I am not racist or extremist But I HATE Radical extremist Muslims and KKK and now ANTIFA BLM LGBTQ Obama Clinton & Corruption. Destroyers
Bully for you.Your job is to stand up for the Commander in Chief, not to make political statments. If I were @POTUS I'd strip you
Thank God for the Joint Chiefs!
Thank you Gen. Joseph Lengyel for your support. We salute you. #NationalGuard
but we discriminate against the LGBT people :)
We need leaders like you speaking out against racism & protecting our Constitution.  No president should be more important than our country.
All stand against racism, especially Pres Trump.  Dems have decided 2 malign Pres because they can't defeat on issues, & don't care who dies
And America stands with you all
Thank you for speaking up. 
I am human.
You are human.
We are standing up.

I agree that everyone should be nice, but our strength has ALWAYS come from our war-fighting ability, NOT our diversity.  #Priorities
so true.Thank you.
Thank you for opining that our Diversity is our Strength, Sir. The Great American Melting Pot is all about HYBRID VIGOR! #IDIC
God bless you all!
As a father of a service member thank you sir
If you love your country & would like to keep your values,history &  statues ..Most better start standing up for your @potus. If not..LOSER

What @SenatorCardin fails to mention is 20 years in prison if you support a UN or EU boycott of Israel or settlements. #BDS #RighttoBoycott https://twitter.com/US_Campaign/status/899734706576609280 …
Gen. Lengyel, I laud ur statement in standing against racism, extremism, & hatred. I thank you for speaking out against this evil
Thank you Sir for giving us hope in dark times It's vital to be reminded that our brace men and women in uniform serve all US citizens. 
Clean the military fast before supporting others
I applaud your comment & thank you for your service but your CIC is a racist & a bigot, now what?
Thank you General.  And the utmost thanks to the National Guard for protecting and upholding the values of our great country.
Thank you General Lengyel!!  You make me proud that my son serves under you!!!  #NationalGuard
Thanks General!
Thank you for your service and your strength.
We know
Thankyou, Sir.
I cry to think what my grandparents, all of whom served in WW2, would think and feel if they saw this.
#NavyWife
So long as you condone all extremism & hatred instead of the ones we are being told are heroes instead of the terrorists they are
And hopefully condemn the words of our #FakePresident and #FascistInChief #littleDonnyDrumpf. Leavenworth should keep a cell ready
Thank you Gen. Lengyel. Our Joint Chiefs are standing up for American values and it is a great comfort to know this. Blessings
Thank you General!
words words words.  DO SOMETHING!!!!!!
Please condemn the call to dip bullets on pig blood.  I can't believe I even have to ask this.
NOT GOOD ENOUGH. You must renounce the Nazi in the WH by NAME. His name is .@realDonaldTrump and he's a NAZI.
Thank you from a grateful nation!
Thanks for being a patriot and for standing up for your principles,
Thank you for your leadership and service. God bless you
No word from Joint Chiefs if they oppose ongoing JimCrow "separate & unequal" #VoterSuppression of DC citizens in US military. #DCstatehood
I can stand with them as you.  BUT HOW DO YOU STAND BESIDE KNOWING WHAT 45 REPRESENTS ? HONOR, TRUTH, COUNTRY, VALUES ?
Agreed, Thank you for standing up for military and American values and thank you for protecting America. You give great comfort.
Thank you. This means a lot.
Can't you & the rest of them get together and declare him unfit? Order a psych eval? Abt 70% of the ppl'd be OK w/a coup Riiiight about now.
Did you vote for trump?
#ItsTime2CondemmTrump
Our security is in the #RemovalOfDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrumpNow
Thank you for your leadership. We need all we can get.
Make sure to vet all social media b4 recruiting. Authoritarians love the military and police work. Chance to use their rage.
If diversity is a strength, why do all members of the military wear the same uniform & have the same haircut. E Pluribus Unum Remember that!
I sincerely hope that when the time comes, and it will, you will do the right thing sir.
THANK YOU SIR, NOW PLEASE ADDRESS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH THE #UN TROOPS SECONDED ON US SOIL, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR TREASON EITHER!
Thank you!! It's good to know our milatry is in safe hands!
THANK YOU, GENERAL!  That's a virtuous and patriotic sentiment! Now will you back it up by calling for Nazi sympathizer Trump to #resign?
Now drag that SOB out of the White House.
.@SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan U & @GOP r responsible 4 putting a Dangerous Incompetent @POTU$ in d WH-#Censure 45th Now! @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
If America continue to the evil path of these hate groups,you don't know what our creator will do.What God has given, he can all take away!
i implore you then to assist the people of boston in standing against the nazi marchers this weekend. Actions over words, sir.
Thank you General!!!
Thank you Sir 
Thank you for your service Sir.
Did you want to specifically condemn POTUS for his comments, or .... ?
Thank you. Can you take one more step please and call out Trump?
Thank you for standing up against our enemies, even when he's one of our own. #Resist #TrumpTraitor #MAGA
I thank for your service to our country. There Is a storm building in our country. Will you help quell the storm?
#SayHisName
Thank you Gen. Joseph Lengyel I'm so grateful for your love and devotion for what the United States of America truly stands for and defends.
Thank you sir and to all the other branches of the military for recognizing these barbaric acts for what they are.
@POTUS 
They are not listening to you and will not listen to you. They are men of courage and conviction and they see you for what you are.
He stands with Joint Chiefs, not Trump!
Thank you!!! xoxoxoxoxo
Work on removing the racist white supremacists from the White House and Congress, they have no place in leadership roles for our country
Thank you, I am grateful for the protection of this great country and the people who serve
thank you
Thank you.
Thank You!
Thank you for your leadership
Agree. I lead a sheltered life thanks to the great work you and your team are doing. Thanks for the great service.
General, thank you for taking a stand with your fellow Joint Chiefs. Please- we may need you to step in & save us from fascism. Red alert.
The signs are very bad. This is unprecedented. Law enforcement is prob infiltrated by white supremacists. Can we count on you if need be?
Thank you
I condemn Donald Trump.
Well we have a president who is praising the traitorous confederacy. And is under a counter intelligence investigation. Do something!
But you won't weed them out even though you know that some use the military as "Hate University", because you need the warm bodies.
do you stand with Antifa & BLM who have incited Hate and racism?
This is true, but you and I, and anybody with a brain cell, knows there is blatant racism in the military.
Yes there sure is. My nephew served in Iraq. He's Italian but very dark & looks very arabic. He faced racism every day
Thank you General.
Your CiC is an embarrassment to our country as well as our greatest threat to democracy!!! 
#SayHisName #ImpeachTrump
Thank you, sir.
Don't let their lives be shat upon with Nazi America
Much love...there have been many military deaths from those fighting to ensure the protection of ALL of our people
It will be our military that ultimately will save of from trumpian fascism. A bit of a constitutional problem but necessary
Someone inform General Kelly if this stance.
Thank you, sir!  You & the rest of the Joint Chiefs are showing moral courage.  The appeasement of Neo-Nazis & KKK by the WH is disgraceful.
thank you he is destroying this already great country
Thank you.
THANK YOU (to infinity and beyond!!)
https://gopwillnotgovern.com/2017/06/02/the-permanent-government-v-dolt-45-redux/ …
your Tweet was quoted by @washingtonpost
Condemn the Presidents statements too while you are at it sir.
Hey can't. This is a strong statement from a military officer.
Excellent
Thank you, not only for your service, but for being a voice of reason.
Thank you Sir.
You sir, are a silly PC sod
Diversity is NOT strength though it can surely be a component of strength but just as frequently causes fracture
Only because reactionary idiots refuse to accept reality. Keep drinking the Kool aid.
Yum
You forgot to @realDonaldTrump There I've done it for you.  No need to thank me
ANTIFA,BLM,white supremacist,radical Islam,socialist fascist instigators,lying media,corrupt politicians have no place in America.
Weak statement, Sad
I thank you  for  standing up!!!
Thank you.
General your as strong as a pimple on a hogs ass.
Do you vow to disobey when Trump tweets that blacks and jews won't be allowed to serve, or will you betray them like you did transgenders?
Hero List Appointment 
Please form a military coop and take back the White House until we can organize a general election.

You should then stand against ANYONE who supports intolerance, Nazi ideology, and hatred.
Thank you for standing up!
Now all the Joint Chiefs just need to acknowledge that Trump is clear & present danger to our democratic way of life. #RacistInChief #NoH8

Thank you
This IS what makes America Great! NOT DONALD TRUMP!
Thank you !
Let's make sure that @realDonaldTrump is aware of it too!
Who is/was the Svoboda party in the Ukraine????
Please put a little bug into General Kelly's ear before he loses all his pride
Thank you
#SayHisName or what you tweet is meaningless
The white nationalists should be driven out of the USA like ISIS was in Iraq.
Did U condemn when BLM marched & chanted "What do we want? We want dead cops?" Did u condemn the 1 shot Steve Scalise? Hypocrite.!
I like this . I would love to see the national guard treat these white supremacist terrorist the same way unarmed ferguson protestors were
Thank you general
Thank you, Sir!
General, thanks for your service and your courage. Help save USA.
you were quoted in an article by @USATODAY
#ImpeachTrump #StopTheTrumpAdministration
Thats how all dictators start , make certain groups feel slighted by the other groups ,pit them off against each other ,#WeaponizedCitizens!
thank you, sir. and as others have said, it's painful that it needs to be put into words.
But shall you defend the constitution against ALL who threaten it?
Thank you, sir. #AmericaDeservesBetter
Thank you General for your service to our country and the strength to speak up!
Thank you General. I hope the #NationalGuard are locked, loaded and ready for action. We're going to be requiring your services before long.

Say right out that you condemn the president's equivocation, please.
Thank you so much sir.
Thank you!
@ChiefNGB all you joint chiefs speaking up for what is right is a breath of fresh air. thank you. 
Bless our military!! 
Thank you.  But you need to http://SAY.HIS.NAME . or it's meaningless
Your words mean nothing until you execute a #MilitaryCoup and remove this despot.
Well said! We are an inclusive country, stronger from it. Thank you for your service, bravery & protection.
Thank you @ChiefNGB for doing the right thing.
Bless you General
Thank you Sir. Honour and integrity. 
So this is where we are now? Armed forces force to disavow their CIC because he's a lunatic!
Anyone in mind?

Say it. Do it. #ImpeachTrump
Thank you for standing up for American values.
Thank you, Sir for your service and courage. I believe your branch will be sorely tested in the coming days. Honor, Service & Country.
these comments would have been helpful before the election.
Thank God. Glad to hear this!
Our military will have very difficult choices ahead.  Sir, I truly hope and pray the military will be able to put country before party.
Thank you General! #NationalGuard Call on Congress to #CensureTrump
Name his NAME!
Thank you from We The People General!!!
@GenDaveGoldfein @ArmyChiefStaff @GenRobertNeller @DeptofDefense  Talk is cheap.
What actions will you be taking to purge these terrorists from our armed services?
Who are you condemning. Is trump in there. Couldn't find it
Thank you General! We appreciate all you do.
The joint Chiefs work at the pleasure of the President and will do as they're told. Today's statements might not reflect tomorrow's actions.
God bless you
Well said!
Then I suggest that you have a talk with your boss or mass resignation
It's okay to call Trump out by name.
go to the Oval and tell your C-In-Chief
Why won't any of you have the balls to condemn your President?
What about Nazis? Looks like a statement prepared by the WH.
https://twitter.com/immigrant4trump/status/898006333861097472 …
Any relation to the legendary Marshall coach?
Thank you General for Standing Up against Racism. We all appreciate your service to our country. #NationalGuard
Now this is starting to get real fangs. Has Chump bitten off more than he can chew??
Thank you, General. Nice to see leadership again in this nation... we've missed it of late
Thank you!
Hmmm....seems like a coordinated effort in our midst. While it would normally cause concern, under the circumstances, it's ok. Protect!
General, you forgot to condemn the man who created the extremism in our country. Call him by name, Donald J. Trump!
needs to get specific and rebuke  Trump
Thank you Sir!
Thank you so much for being on the right side of history.
Dear General: Thank you for standing up so clearly. The day may come when the Joint Chiefs have to back up those words with actions. #usa
Thank you for protecting America from enemies both foreign...and domestic.
I commend our military leaders who stand against racist hate groups though their Commander in Chief does not @POTUS
