how else would you pay for uninsured people who need healthcare? lol
Get rid of deregulation and stop the greed!
Hard work ahead to make health more affordable.
That means that, if your premium is $300/mo now, it'll be $1,290/mo in 2026.
It rises as the cost of living rises, Ben Carson doesn't bother to mention that!!
Now's the time for Dems and Reps to work together to help us, the non elected and highly affected Americans. Make healthcare good for all.
Can u name me a time over the last decade the CBO has been correct. The CBO numbers will bewrong since they continue to use the ACA formula.
If you clowns in Congress actually had Ocare, instead of exempting yourselves, you'd sing a different tune. 

We eat dog food, you feast!
How many times did AHA premiums jump?
Have you even read the bill? How would it cause premiums to go up? By not forcing people to buy insurance they dont find valuable?
CBO has also been wrong on just about every prediction it has made. Including saying ACA would reduce deficits by 1.5T (which was way off)
reference please?
Official CBO score from 2010 states that budget deficits over 10 year period would be reduced by 1.2T. was off by 300 billion, but still...
So 0.02%? It seems like a lot  a huge mistake, but when you are dealing with numbers that large you have to understand the margin of error
Yikes!
Mine have gone up about 20% every year since Obamacare was implemented
Have they? Post your bills.
Let me get back to my office and I’ll pull up the records online
No! CBO math & assumptions do not compute. There is no way insurance $ go that high & as u claim cover FEWER ppl. CBO lies AGAIN! #RepealACA
The only reason Obamacare has not gone up 20% or more each year is because taxpayers have funded it for billions of $.
Thanks senators murkowsky Collins and McCain for doing the right courageous thing.
So he saying the increase is not enough and ought to be more? Seems to be the case based on the past.
Thank you for taking a stand! @SenatorCardin #CancerMom #CancerSUCKS #morethan4 Our children will face the consequences of our actions.
Those poor insurance companies. They're really suffering, right?
Man, even the insurance companies know this is a bad idea....
Great call by @SenSchumer to get the extra 5 mins for @RonWyden to explain that to dem and republicans
As opposed to Obamacare, where… oh yes, premiums rise sharply every year.
Shows you hiw dishonest the CBO truly is
In January my employer based ins premiums rose 300%. Thanks Ben & all your socialist cronies hurting America one family at a time.
As a Maryland Voter & Veteran thank for voting No!
@MoveOn @SenateGOP PAY ATTENTION! Trump's plan to boost the economy is on the backs of working Americans. $$ for the rich.
#maga's want nothing to do with "being clear". They want their information as murky as they can get it unfortunately. They need to #Evolve
@SenJohnMcCain  Thank you sir!
Well wth can we do NOW?? All those monsters are sitting in the room with you folks!!! Thing is sociopaths DON'T CARE!
well it's a good thing insurance isn't insanely expensive with high deductibles that can make it useless. Oh.. oh wait.
Well, if you are lucky enough to be in the near 50% of nations uninsured, you won't have to worry about premiums going up.
Well that sucks.
@ivyleaguepunk My Blue Shield premium went up 24% this year WITHOUT their bill. How much more can in possibly increase.
I'm still waiting on the$2500 per year obamacare was going to save me.  Instead it increases by 300% in one year.
Wow! Wow! What heartless, cruel, immoral, unethical Republicans! Shame on you @GOP #TrumpCareKills #KillTheBill #SaveACA
Seriously, is my math correct? After 10 years what costs $1000 today will cost $4000? Better make sure your car doesn't break down.
Never mind getting sick or being diagnosed with cancer. Cheaper to buy a gun & a bullet than try to pay for chemo & radiation.
There is a coup going on as we speak in the Senate. It's being led by rich, white Americans who hate PoC, immigrants, poor, & middle class.
Oh my god.
What the hell is going on down there? Canada is getting concerned by all the crazy coming out of Washington
In 2026 pay $5.15 for every $1 you currently spend just in case you didn't think you would be one of the 16M people killed by this bill.
Wow! So in 8 years I'll be paying approx. $3200/month??!!! Way to lower those premiums @LindseyGrahamSC !
Vote no
A travesty of governance. Not with a bang but a whimper
People shouldn't have to stay up late and monitor twitter to catch a glimpse of the shape their finances & health will have in the morning.
Over 400%increase in 10 years
Why would they still trying to push this Skinny Bill thru? They already know it will affects millions? Is this America?
So if your 55 you can exhaust your life savings by the time your 60.  And that's if you stay healthy 
Angry..We are witnessing the rape of our democracy right in front of our eyes..
Great so we can be in debt from college and now from paying for healthcare! Thanks @SenateGOP, you're really representing us!
U think Obamacare is working? Open you . U liberals are gonna lose again in 4 years. Absolutely no message
One person said thats a total of a 430% increase.
Will salaries rise by 20% every year too to cover this?

Any GOP Senator who votes to pass bill should be voted out. Acting against your constituents is unacceptable and egregiously evil.
Someone let me kno when the BIG BIGwinning starts the biggest of the big best of the best winningness winning begins I don't want to miss it
Jesus Christ they are nuts
Tens-of-thousands of newly-uninsured Americans will end up dead, too; mainly in GOP-run Red states....
Easy math - in 4 years, your premiums will more than double.  In 8 years, they quadruple. Unconscionable.
I'm totally fine with that if my Salary doubles.  But it fucking WONT.
STOP LETTING THEM DRAW THIS OUT.
20% every year.  Thank you GOP and the dandy Trump administration.
MAGA! congrats Trump voters, you just blew health care rates up by 20% a year, if you keep your insurance at all ... winning?
And midnight is the 52nd anniversary of Medicare & Medicaid.
...on top of current projected increases.
You're screwed regardless.  Big business doesn't have to offer healthcare now

A 20% increase every year, compounded at the end of each year, for eight years straight, = a 430% increase.

Good god. https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/890772417978806272 …
But @tedcruz said high premiums were the reason to repeal ACA ... No #SkinnyRepeal
I read it as 20% more than they would have risen anyway.  A 5% rise becomes a 6% rise, etc.
Keep fighting. We Marylanders appreciate your efforts.
If all this keeps on, it'll be 2026 before anything happens.  Back and forth, back and forth, lies and lies, truths and dares, yays and nays
Would you mind explaining the math to my Senator, @SenCoryGardner ?He's not good with numbers, or answering calls. Thx.
A big hit on household finances .
Full CBO https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/s.a.667.pdf …
Yet @GOP allows not one pause for reflection. Thank you to my MD senators @SenatorCardin @ChrisVanHollen for NO votes.
Hard  to know who to believe since you all lie
Senator Cardin, you seem surprised. This is the Trump administration. Greed has taken over the U.S. government. Remove TRUMP then repair.
