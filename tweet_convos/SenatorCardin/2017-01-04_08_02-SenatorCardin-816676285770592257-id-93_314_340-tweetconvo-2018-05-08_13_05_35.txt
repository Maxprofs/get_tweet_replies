@SenSchumer Bullshit.
Hopefully there changes will decrease insurance premiums without very hugh deductibles. ACÁ was not good legislation.
@FriendEden100 ......and raise rates on a whim!
Of course! While @SpeakerRyan has the best healthcare in the world for free! #MakeAmericaSickAgain
Congress should be required 2have what the rest of us wind up with!Besides,they work part time!
I agree 100% Have read some of their coverage, unbelievable?
@ebpersons As long as Amerikkka is White oops.. Great Again who needs Healthcare?
Maybe they can look at this short list to see what they need. #VotingAgainstThemselves again.
This does not list White Supremacy so Trumpsters need no healing from regular maladies!
Yes, mental health is missing from the list; white supremacy is delusional thinking, a DSM listed disorder.
white people do not have mental illness.
Racist ones do.
Sophia, I blocked John some time ago. Please exclude me from thread. Zero tolerance for trolls.
Blocked him also.
If you're so concerned about their plan to #repeal the #ACA why didn't you sign the objection for the EV tally? All talk!
Insurence is a business and has swindled the public for years. Hospitals a business is complicit with Insurence companies.
Trump he would protect thepreexisting clause.Obamacare failed, work with Trump to fix the mess you made!
@RitaHisgenBoone And that is what the republicans want! They are working for insurance lobbyist.
As a parent with 2 children who have potential pre-existing conditions, thank you for standing for MD fams!
@MoveOn it is horrifying what is happening in this new congress, we will soon be taxed wothout any benefit to us.
Please work toward end of increasingly rising of DISCRIMINATION: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4092360/Three-teens-24-year-old-charged-wi.html …
no it won't. scare tactics while I pay for people who don't work
Then work with them to make it better. It is your job. I do not like Obamacare. I tried it, it was bad.
@SenSchumer Dem get heads out of Obama's butt y'all already loop holed over 100,000 retired auto workers loss Thier coverage
#fakenews there buddy

I'm a disabled mom with a college kid who only can get reasonable coverage with ACA. We truly need Obamacare!
@SenSchumer GOP clearly stated New plan will have ACA SO WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKUNG ABOUT
@SenSchumer 
Please...you don't know what you are talking about
There are solutions to save the #ACA. We must demand a public option.
1) Why is the #GOP intent on repealing the #ACA and what can we do about it? #Obamacare #MakeAmericaSickAgain 
But you all refuse to work with them to come up with something affordable? Don't believe 1 word you say.
Wrong again.  You don't listen!
@SenSchumer fake news! Lying schmuck! That's one of the things they are keeping!
as they should.why should I pay more or the same as an obese person or a smoker? Or someone with Aids?
@SenSchumer Sen. Fix that case 4 these people. Quit destroying access 4 all Americans! Govt.not authorized in Constitution!
Bravo, Senator Schumer, for standing up to the sociopath!
terrifying
@SenSchumer we should go back to witch doctors and blood letting- the sky is falling; the sky is falling
Are you covered under the #ACA ?
@SenSchumer Pretty simple, if states want socialized medicine, nothing stops them.  Go for it NY.
#ACA @repeal will keep us from a time when unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats decide when you're not worth saving
Coverage for pre-existing conditions not exclusive to #ACA and can be continued with new legislation. Dishonest scare tactic
Tired of paying for illegals med. ins. and moochers.Why should they get med. when we are working and can't afford to go to Dr
So Trump will take that away from Pre Exist people and then lose all elections for Rep's running next time? LOL
Except that they plan to keep it.When will Dems tell the truth?
I can only pray I get taken back to previous insurance, doctor and premium rate...I've been raped by Obamacare...repeatedly
@SenSchumer Keep lying folks. 2018 is right around the corner. Chuckie doesn't give a damn about 'affordable' healthcare.
we will not take this. GOP will pay a terrible price.
It'll go back to how it was.......ppl filling up the er because they don't have Healthcare to see a doctor
Including rare pre-existing conditions like "being female"
Not true. This is why your party lost again. Marylanders are waking up. Good luck in your next election.
@SenSchumer I have worked my entire life, got injured and am now disabled. SSD is all I have. DONT LET THEM DO IT!
Schumer and Cardin, two total IDIOTS w/the most elite healthcare on the planet thanks to hard working taxpayers.
@SenSchumer Do you gents use Obamacare? If not why not?
@MoveOn STAY TUFF !!
Health care is a matter of national security. People w/out healthcare esp. for "prexisting conditions" = nation unable to protect itself.
@MoveOn democrats will sink their ship to keep Obamacare for fear they will be racist if they don't fight for his legacy
your the poster child for term limits retirement is your best bet
your 'code' word 'discriminate' will sure scare the mindless libs! Being able to buy insurance across state lines WINS!!!
Another senior scare talking point!  Another lie.!
WHY IS CONGRESS EXEMPT FROM OBAMA CARE if it is so great for the rest of us???   HYPOCRITES!!!!!
@SenSchumer Are you Cardin bought and paid for by special interests and lobbyists? Do u really care about our health? MAGA!
@SenSchumer Republican plan will take us to NEW unbelievably good healthcare for ALL Americans Trump can't be bought.Helps us
@SenSchumer @SenSchumer Obamacare is a disaster.  Repeal and replace it NOW.
LIAR, LIAR, Liars!
More BS from the rejected, repudiated party of old geezers.
@SenSchumer Politicians can't give us healthcare.Trump can.
@SenSchumer democrats will sink their ship to keep Obamacare for fear they will be racist if they don't fight for his legacy
this is all of us over 30
because no one is smart enough to think about that except you. Offer assistance instead of resistance.
we are aware. What should we citizens doto counter act this impending debacle? I voted, & think the ACA is the best option.
And that's coming from someone with a pre existing condition
Easy to say when you pay nothing for awesome health care
