Thank you for your stand for truth and our country but WHEN will the GOP put country before party?
Bless you Senator Cardin, and thank you for hearing our plea.
Thank you Senator Cardin.
Will you promise to get back to work for Americans after nothing is found? Will you promise to not waste any more tax dollars on this?
S27 #wastingtaxpayermoney
Demand #impeach @realDonaldTrump now!
#MarchForTruth from Bloomsberg Pa
Thank you!
@MarchForTruth17 are you going to look into Obama's illegal surveillance which is TRUE story vs the collusion fiction?
For 20 years the US has been working to influence elections in countries around the world. Isn't it a little hypocritical to complain now?

Can you idiots go one day without "Russia" in you vocabulary.
Stuck it in your arsez, we are tired of your wasting time on this word!!
Fight on Ben!! But listen to all your liberal colleagues that have said publicly that there is no evidence at all of any collusion.
We intend to investigate you (financially) and your staff (Family members being paid via our tax dollars).
Grateful..your putting the Country above Poltics...hopefully more will follow suit..
Now get it through. Thank you.
Keep up your no proof accusations you dufe
Good!! CA is with you!
and, we do have a right to know @GOP - you dolts -- you work for us!
Thank you and good luck. I will  encourage my senator @senrobportman to support this bill!
Thank you! Please keep the pressure on!
Kudos on Bill - but no action for 5 mos.
What can WE do? 
.
Investigating an illegitimate Election is ESSENTIAL to our DEMOCRACY!
#Revote
Come on 8 months billions of taxpayers  put in rich dems pockets. Using same poles Hil liar y used. Stop wasting our money!!!!
When you fight for "it", you will be fighting for America.
Sure hope you do more fight for healthcare and fight against that horrid tax plan
Call your Senators and ask that they support S 27 for an independent commission.  Capitol switchboard (202) 224-3121 https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/27 â€¦
Thank you!

Thank you!! @SenateDems Please join your fellow Senator, aka #patriot calling for an #IndependentCommission for #TrumpRussia truth & justice
And on the Seth Rich case, and DNC fraud during Nominations.
Thank you Sir for putting country first. 
Yes. Thank you. I'm sure @SenBobCasey will be on board. How about @SenToomey ?
Thank you Mr. Ben Cardin
Thank You, Senator! 
his administration of mobsters took over the USA.  /end
@GOP CANNOT & SHOULD NOT investigate themselves. That is like a murderer being his own jury.
Thnk you, frm Colorado! I encourage our Colorado senators to support this: @BennetForCO (hopefully will) @SenCoryGardner (don't hold breath)
I'm realizing more and more this is absolutely necessary.  It's critical to survival of USA for everyone to know how and why Trump and /1
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!!!!
Thank You Sen
Thank you. From out here? Things are looking pretty damn bleak.
Thank you, Senator Cardin! I don't live in your state, but you have my gratitude and blessings.
BOTH sides of partisan politics have abused exec orders+ powers/privilege whether red/blue hope 4a gov overhaul/restoration of cks/balances
Thought was Mueller. How about we get Russian to investigate? Will that satisfy nothing there? How About Maxine Waters? Will that satisfy?
TY4 bipartisan focus beyond criminal lens to independent commish on ALL foreign tampering/conflict of interest #COI
Special counsel will investigate criminal activity but #S27 creates a commission to report on ALL facts/foreign interference. #MarchForTruth 
That's my Senator!
Ok @SenToomey it's your turn to show PA citizens that your not a complete sell out! 
TY @SenatorCardin please continue the fight .. many for of us that couldn't attend, also support #MarchForTruth
Thank you for fighting for us every day.  This ugly, traitorous regime will literally destroy our country. #MarchForTruth #TrumpRussia
More hypocrisy. Unbelievable.
Proud of my MD @SenatorCardin
If Russia had interfered it would have been in Hillary's favor, so just stop this BS
Why are you wasting time on this. There is nothing there. Do some real work for the people of MD instead.
More obstruction we need to throw all of you out. Just do your dam job that is not your job
While your at it how about 1 on Hillary and 1 on Obama wh unmasking and IRS and guns in Mexico and spying on millions of Americans
And which specific alleged crimes would the commission investigate, Senator?
#myth #LetItGo
How about a commission investigating Bibi/Israel interference in our politics & elections? Saudi Arabia & Turkey too? #MarchfForTruth
Thanks, don't see my Senators Jeff Flake or McCain standing up for we the people or for the Earth! Shame on them.
Thank you. We need the truth. Not  the unintelligible babble of Agent Orange.
Can we (March for work) quit recess ,stay in Washington get Health care, Budget, important things . Pull this country together,not apart
We need a 4th investigation? You don't believe FBI, Senate, House or Mueller Dems will never believe ANY SAD country u have created
Thank you, Senator Cardin.
Any chance you and others in Congress will ever introduce legislation intended to help Americans? Or just more politics as usual?
Yeah, I thought so... Politics...
Perhaps you can introduce legislation to validate the existence of unicorns as will...
Thank you @SenatorCardin I New you wouldn't let me down
@realDonaldTrump America will hold you accountable for Treason.
You and your co-conspirators will be impeached & prosecuted.
