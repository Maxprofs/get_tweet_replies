oh cry me a river, that is all U dems do is whine and hold up @POTUS cabinet picks, we R going to vote U all out next time
sorry but I don't see where Muslims are being targeted
Pretty sure they were targeted just the other day while staring at the gun inside their Quebec mosque.
Dem Senators can stop this -- #withholdconsent and #filibuster until the Ban is rescinded.
US drones targeted 100s of thousands, but democrats did that, so, no protests & no news reports, pathetic hypocrisy.
More and More ppl r now waking  up and the # awake will continue to GROW thank God
"For their faith," Senator? Really? Did you even READ the EO or are you just pandering? This is #FalseOutrage.
you forgot the Democratic motto..you have to vote for it before you read it..
Or in this case, hyperbolically condemn and distort content to stir protests and cry #FakeTears
Trump Day 12
Czar Trump signs exec. order expunging the Constitution, 230 years of U.S. history.
Using hype to obstruct a democratically elected president is UNAMERICAN but you already know that.
SO VOTE NO on Tillerson, Sessions, Mnuchin, DeVos, Price. DRAIUNTrump's swamp. Vet BANNON- America's new CANCER
.@SenatorCardin #JeffSessions as AG will not make this better. Vote NO!
we R voting all the dems out next time,watch for it, it is in place now

@SenateDems No one is being targeted because of their faith!Vetting Refuges that come from Countries that harbor Terrorist!
THEY WERE NOT TARGETED 4 THEIR FAITH.THEY ONLY DETAINED 109 PPL TO QUESTION THEM DEEPER. To make sure that we were safe....
just watch
thank you Senator Cardin.
build the Wall
Are they immigrants coming to the US or your constituents?
lying to the people to push ur ideology is unamerican. Try the truth once in a while, u may not become obsolete
...It had nothing to do with their faith but where they came from.
Well then Ben - WHY DID YOU ALL APPROVE THE CABINET PICKS and give this tyrant legitimacy?  HUH? Spineless
@SenateDems I have been detained entering a foreign country! So what it's the law of their country! Stop Whinning
why have you guys done NOTHING about that as Obama dumped thousands of them into our country huh? Sharia is BAD!!
Are you even aware that in Minneapolis they teach them Sharia law but not our Constitution? THAT IS DANGEROUS!
nobody is targeting their faith. It is however the cause of more bloodshed down thru the ages than ANYTHING else.
no you don't. These are NOT Americans. THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY OUR CONSTITUTION! we MUST be careful!
no ban
SEDITION

No Citizens were detained.. just stop it now.. only citizens are your constituents..
Get real you fools...
Were they really detained because of their faith, Ben, or because of their country of origin? Kind of an important detail.
Ben you're smarter then that. You should be ashamed of yourself! You're a grown man. SMH
Untruth. Read the EO. Makes no mention of Islam, Muslim, etc.
Give it a break no he did not WRITE any EO on faith.
vote NO on Steve Mnuchin
@SenateDems. So statt an empeachment movement
#witholdconsent

Stop your drama! We the people have spoken. The election is over!
confirm Sessions, our country deserves the rule of law, not politics.
Now please DO NOT confirm anymore of President Trump's cabinet picks who will continue this agenda. #voteNO
@ryanzerbe You took a oath its not your Job to pick & choose what laws you want to follow. Time to remove traders at ballot.
It's an EO, not a law and it has a stay on it currently b/c its unconstitutional and its spelled traitors.
@dpeterfreund what is your stance on #sessions based on this? Withhold Consent!! No on DeVos. No on them all!!
@serenityatsea Get Bannonout if there!He will be inventing propaganda to use!He has no Right to be in security! @SenFeinstein
Please gather fellow senators to stand up to Trump. We need you now more than ever to provide checks and balances.
Did you read same Ex Order that I did? The word RELIGION is nowhere in it. Are you making up another story or is thisRhetoric
@SenateDems NO ON SESSIONS!
https://youtu.be/mY4LGECbjTg 
PLEASE vote NO on Sessio & No on DEVOS.
Thank you for your protests against these orders. Now, will you come out to oppose @SenatorSessions to become AG?
We have crying rooms for you and them. It's better to be safe than sorry...too bad! Proper vetting is our right.
@SenateDems  so terrorist that would kills is American. Your free to join and live in any other country. Unhappy here? Go!
Boo bloody hoo. No ones faith is being targeted. Spreading BS IunAmerican
Thank you, I believe it will take a concerted effort of elected officials, rallys, marches, media and more to make a change.
I'm one of your constituents+my American family deserves protection.It took +2yrs for my father to be vetted,allowed entry.
If Refugees are from these 7 nations the OBAMA admin.identified as having higher incidence of terrorism...they can wait,too.
Are you going to spend your last term fighting everything and getting nothing done?Work across the aisle and be reasonable!
@SenateDems Vote No on Sessions, vote no on DeVos.
thank you, Senator!!!!!
have you forgotten September 2011. How did  they enter USA. Boston  bombers??????
targeting native peoples for their faith is very American. Remember Wounded Knee & the cross over their graves.
@SenateDems liar. They can't vote.
@SenateDems Thank you! I tried calling your office today, but VM was full. I think that's a good thing!
thank you senator. Now, what is your plan of action??? --Constituent in Silver Spring.
@SenateDems if targeting 4 faith is "un American" Y are ALL violent beatings of protesters being done by intolerant Muslims?
Were they stuck because of your constant protests? We voted for a Safe America.
Right, ex-Senator.
Boo hoo we don't know these people let's keep our country safe!!!
just going to leave this here
you missed that word "average". Personally I don't want to give up my humanity because of misplaced fear. But you do you.
Farook was an American born citizen and Malik was a legal US resident. What would this ban have done?
@SenateDems cool. What are you doing to #resist ?
@SenateDems
@SenateDems be honest. Religion has nothing to do with it. You are more worried about reelection than getting work done
@SenateDems Dear Senator Dimwit; it's not a ban on Muslims. Quit with empty rhetoric. It's temporary freeze to vet immigrants
it's a waste to say this. They can't read. Idiots

@SenateDems You mean country of origin, right?
Dems need 2 break out in2 committees to fight each thing they do - Ban, hacking, wall, etc. Don't lose sight of hacking.
Ur so busy spinnin that I bet u don' even know what's real anymore.
@SenateDems republicans have not one voter stranded and if they do, they don't care
@SenateDems frightened? Lol..
@SenateDems and you spreading a false narrative is. And still, u don't understand why you guys r losing voters
tweeting isn't helping. Go do something.
@SenateDems then do something.  Words aren't enough.
Thank you for speaking up! #stoppresidentbannon
WHY do the DEMS/LIBS, MSM & "so called" celebrities hate hard working Americans so much? #IamWithHIM
fight him on everything. Don't throw him any bones.
you are why politicians are thought of as
.@SenatorCardin,
Please vote NO on Sen Sessions. 
Please vote NO on Betsy DeVos.
.@SenatorCardin,
Please vote NO on Sen Sessions. 
Please vote NO on Betsy DeVos.
Thank you for standing up & speaking out. We support u 100% #WeAreAllImmigrants #wewillprotest #wewillnotbesilent #WeWillWin
Please don't spin it to a religious ban. To encounter a delay for the good of all Americans is a small price. #asaferamerica
You probably also have constituents that want their children safe.  But that doesn't matter because they are white.
I'm with you 100% Senator!
unAmerica but Trumpic unfortunately
Where was this comment on Saturday night?
