yes to the wall you crooked politicians have stolen from us you last time this is war against God and you loose
Thank you for supporting America's continued  welcoming of refugees, especially those from war torn countries.
Take them into your town Cardin.  Give them all they need at your expense, not ours.
I help the needy everyday and even when I pay taxes for all refugees while American's, our Vets suffer.
Are you a Christian who will not help needy vets??  Hypocrite!
Uassumed the 1 you posted to was Christian shirking their Christlike values!  Why is that! Hate Christians?
Be clear: the 90-day ban is for safety of Americans. The wall is for control of who comes & goes. What's wrong with that?
the 7 banned countries are proved to have led to no US deaths, and the wall won't control immigration
most illegal immigrants come either on plane or with a travel visa, wall doesn't stop either
At least they won't be strolling across by the hundreds!
the wall seems kind of unrealistic to me, the cost is sky high and the time it would take to complete it probably over a decade
American workers and Mexican workers are diligent, focused and work hard. I say one year, not a decade!
are Mexicans working on it? Also the border fence took 5 years, and it was only a combination of fence and vehicles!
then let them live in your home and pay for them

Remember Ellis Island?? Vetting has been going for a long time.
Why don't the refugees go west?
#NoCardin #NoCardin @BobLeahyJr It only took @realDonaldTrump 5 days to erase 8 years of STUPID!
I DON'T THINK IT SAYS: "GIVE ME YOUR TERRORISTS", AS MUCH AS YOU SEEM TO BE WELCOMING THEM.
I am so proud to call you my senator!   Thank you for taking a stand against the Muslim ban.
@TheDemocrats how about working class Americans with the jobs overseas. Ever heard of us? Remember us?
Have you startedputting money up for them the mexicans are already flooding the US many illegal
@MSNBC @RoyBlunt @SenJohnMcCain Senator Cardin, Ty for your objectivity. 1st & foremost we should always do the right thing!
@VFORVICTORY1 #trump supporters have a delusional view of #Jesus and his teachings. To many, he's a white imperialist. #Noban
Just ask them to come LEGALLY!!!
DoJ’s Sally Yates Wanted Muslim Refugees Not Christians, Says Source http://theguardiannews.ml/44e   https://twitter.com/USA_PolicalNews/status/826605084595195904/photo/1pic.twitter.com/2bfdVbD3WX 
@TheDemocrats Vetting immigrants is nothing new. Stop the sensationalism and do your job. Protect Americans!
That was written when people came to help build our country, not suck welfare benefits & blow us up with pressure cookers.
You & Babs voted for it
@TheDemocrats they have had and will have their chance. As soon as we know they have American intentions at heart
That's Obamas list. Trump didn't pick that shit as much as you want to hate on him for it. #itwasyourboy
sorry bro that's your boys list. You see when you take a very i@portabt job you have to use what's given. Obamas list.
Obama made the list. See also 2011 when the same thing didn't piss you off.
fake http://news.you 're such a tool.Statue of Liberty had NOTHING to do with immigrants.Know your history Senator
When Muslim immigrants blow up innocent Americans in Boston, sir, I must object. @CNN @nytimes @latimes @washingtonpost
well for 8 years under obama it did not apply to syrian christians who were murdered
You guys gotta realize that democracy is over & the rules we used to know no longer apply. Now let's fight to get them back.
thank you! You have my support as always.
As Pres. Theodore Roosevelt said they must assmilate to stay in this country.
exactly what about our forgotten Vets and homeless people. THEY SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
People who were vetted in detail.  My grandparent came to US thru Ellis Island, did it the right way; became US citizens!
It certainly doesn't apply to unvetted terrorist. Obstructionist and worthless representation!
hey!  You are an #amalclooney pal, right? Those who hang w the enemy are unfit to serve http://ln.is/wordpress.com/G9SvB …
Can you tell us what % of refugees want Shari'a Law instituted above the US constitution? https://youtu.be/NGaO3NKJa-8 
If you want to stop the Ban do it! #withholdconsent and #filibuster until the Ban is rescinded. No business as usual!
have to do more then tweet sir! STAND UP AND FIGHT!
@TheDemocrats 
the order is a nightmare and embarrassing! Please fight! Impeach Trump !
America first mr. Cardin. Again how do you think we can be safe?
disappointed with you. Ignorant to think there will be no one detained. I was during 911. I did not kick and scream
how would you keep America safe? How there are no magic wands.
No one has sovereign right to enter America except citizens
Dear Senator Cardin you desire refugees that may wish harm to our nation? Can you vouch for each one?
reject Sessions and Pruitt!
doesn't say anything about importing the enemy during a war.  poem was added by liberals in 1902
@TheDemocrats not what it means buffoon
Stop approving cabinet nominees. Stop Sessions tomorrow.
Delay Sessions vote and then vote NO!
"white" refugees?
Ben Go and Kick Some Ass.....
Thank you from this constituent.
@TheDemocrats Mr Trump made his intent very clear during his campaign,  to ban Muslims from USA,  Americans must speak out!
We need you to stand up to racism and bigotry.  We need you to stand up to Trump. We are counting on you!
it's not about that anymore. Putin's agenda is to destabilize our country and economy. It's a coup!
No to Jeff Sessions. We need impeachment of the president.  This is worse than Nixon!
@TheDemocrats high unemployment, we don't care about American people, we care about bringing in more people to vote Dem
pandering pandering pandering. Where was all this attention for refugees last week who needed help.
@puppymnkey Thank you. Guess trump can't read.  He says he doesn't
only problem is, respectfully senator.. give our huddled masses living homeless help first. Families, Vets...
thank you Senator.
Step up! POTUS just fired the Acting AG. A lawyer who is bound by ethics cant argue in court an unsupportable legal position
Glad to hear this sentiment. Your constituents await a NO vote on Sessions to show action to back up your words.
@TheDemocrats Maybe you own people who are starving on the streets,babies aborted, veterans on the street and refugees
This Bethesda, MD resident agrees with you Senator Cardin 100%.  Please keep up the fight.
Thank you so much for speaking out, many concerns recently, thank you. #NoBanNoWall
@TheDemocrats no actually it doesn't when terrorists are coming in with them killing our civilians.Facts over feelings #MAGA
@adjordan true christian. Kind of. We all want to believe in something yet life is cruel. I miss my European mother.
only approved vetted
@adjordan amen
@TheDemocrats and they will be welcome when they are citizens!
Thank you! Please continue to fight for what is moral and true and just.
It's a reasonable description of @KellyannePolls
@TheDemocrats lady liberty doesn't say give me your extemist that want to change our fabric and bring their laws
One who wants to break/change our laws and way of belief. THIS IS NOT 1955 ANYMORE
It doesn't apply to those who bomb every country that takes them in!
@TheDemocrats hey tool that's before all these entitlement programs were initiated.# end entitlements..
VOTE NO TO BETSY DEVOS. pleeeaassse
@TheDemocrats didn't Obama just ban Cuban refugees a couple weeks ago lol #Hypocrisy
@TheDemocrats must be screened vetted and come legally#americafirst
Where were you when Obama abandoned the Syrians? @POTUS is seeking safe zones for them.

@TheDemocrats #extremevetting#buildthatwall#thepeoplehavespoken
@TheDemocrats . Trump's relatives?
@TheDemocrats I think they want it to refer to American citizens now, which is why they're trying to make us tired, sick, etc
Thank you Senator. We support you 100%. Stop all cabinet & Supreme Court appointments #impeachTrump #Emoluments #Amendment25
@TheDemocrats  another dummy there is a right way and a wrong way.  Let's put them up in your neighborhood.
But there is always a limit to everything, America has reached hers!
It applies to those who would wish us well. Keep the unvettable away from our schools! We like our classes bomb free.
@TheDemocrats Now your going to reference the constitution? More than two decades too late!#draintheswamp
@TheDemocrats Well at this rate it won't be long before we Americans will be tired, poor and yearning to breathe free.
@TheDemocrats Non terrorist! Non Mexican! Non Black! Non LGBT! You know, good, white, Cristian, people like me
@TheDemocrats. It's  a "lose/lose" position.  No preemptive action taken and tragedy happens... same outrage.  Remember 9/11?
@TheDemocrats why don't you ask Hillary about her friends and their pipeline, then get them to take of all the refugees

@TheDemocrats It applies to following the procedure to be in America!
It means America has rules and protects Americans
Point to the constitution this refers to , please. @TheDemocrats
@TheDemocrats yes, if your home country has known terrorists living there or cannot be properly vetted. Times have changed,
Not ALL refugees, just the ones who want to kill us, and I have no problem with keeping them out.
@ReganWV I predict #OrangeHitler will get rid of Her Majesty #Liberty. Maybe sell her to #CocaCola
@TheDemocrats what's wrong with building safe zones in the country they are all ready comfortable in?
Trump wants his wall bc he thinks it will be a giant testament to his greatness. Does not care about veterans, elderly, kids.
@TheDemocrats 
To those immigrants and refugees that are coming to America legally to assimilate and become Americans.
Obviously to terrorists who yearn to kill our asses.  Give me an EBT card, Alinsky for Dummies, and free pussy hat!  #MAGA!
apparently it only applies to white christian republicans
@TheDemocrats   Waiting for Exc Order to take down the Statue of Liberty!
American workers, middle class, poor, seniors, disabled, minorities, LGBT, veterans under Trump?
Trump must be impeached.
@TheDemocrats Trump doesn't have a clue where that is written.
Trump needs to be Impeached ASAP! He Isn't even qualified to clean Toilets at a Local Public Rest Room!
@TheDemocrats Trumps future wives?
@TheDemocrats your Americans? Just a shot in the dark.
@TheDemocrats Don't u see that his multiple chaos has to be met with one simple word; IMPEACH!
@TheDemocrats We need your courage and adherence to normal standards now more than ever, Ben.
.@SenatorCardin please keep speaking out. Vote no on all cabinet picks
@TheDemocrats it only applies to those of minority religious persecution. Not mostly Muslim.
@TheDemocrats
@TheDemocrats
@TheDemocrats
@TheDemocrats
REJECT SESSIONS.
They can't dullard.  GOP majority.  @SenatorCardin
@TheDemocrats if somebody poured u a bowl of cereal & told you 5 of the flakes r laced with poison would you eat the cereal?
your logic - All white teenage males should not be allowed to go to high school bc All massacres were perpetrated by them.
yeah cuz those are same things...try again.
oh so your in favor of gun control?
the only thing I EVER agreed with Hillary Clinton about id that if u r on no-fly list u should not be able to purchase a gun
@TheDemocrats thank you Senator for your service
.@SenatorCardin Poem continues, "The wretched refuse of your teeming shore." Lazarus definitely meant refugees--exiled, abandoned people.
@TheDemocrats Nice try. We can't take everyone who wants to come in, you should know better
I thought it was written about racist xenophobes who have suffered so deeply under a minority quasi-foreign President
@TheDemocrats To Trumpsky only!
well said sir
@TheDemocrats legal ones..
@TheDemocrats so Americans safety isn't worth a 3mos freeze on immigration from countries we can't properly vet?  #MAGA
well our TSA under Obama did pat down 5year old children even put on No Fly Lists on a regular basis so...
18 month old child work for you?

It applies to everyone at end of the day for the Women's March on Washington.!!.Lighten Up!
@TheDemocrats -INNER CITIES, oh but wait, that's where they will be placed as well!
our country was not build on hate #nomuslimban #makeAmericahateagain #Maga #illegitimatePresident #UNFIT
Then stand up and do something other than talk-the base is leaving you behind
@TheDemocrats they wouldn't be refugees if your party had left Syria alone. Our people are weary, and tired of your messes
Very much agree. So where do you stand on @SenatorSessions who is behind Trump's immigration & refugees actions?
keep fighting Senator
The KKK since they voted for trump
@TheDemocrats #liberalsareviolentextremist
lol... You've just have spy TV 
good idea. I love that liberals have a voice, just not a choice anymore... Maybe later, but today is MAGA!
wrong... SCOTUS for decades, see you're naive & fueled w/hate. I feel sorry 4 u. Take a look at the next election pool group
@TheDemocrats don't give a shit
thank you for your leadership on this and many other issues.
@TheDemocrats no...no it doesnt.
Thank you @SenatorCardin for standing up for justice. I'm no longer an MD resident, but you've always served the state honorably.
It applies to Americans First! We need to take care of our own! We need to care for our #VetsFirst + our children/families!
yet were going to cut va funding and spend billions on a wall. How does that help Americans?
Thank you, Senator. Your constituent, John Appel.
Thank you! I am very glad you are one of my Senators!

Please?
Can't we just impeach @realDonaldTrump @potus already so we can get this country back on the right path and make America great again?
