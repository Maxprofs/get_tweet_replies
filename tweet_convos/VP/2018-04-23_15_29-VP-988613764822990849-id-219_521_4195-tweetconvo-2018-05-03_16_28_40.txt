They are manipulating our currency and we shouldn’t let them paint any of our plates until they help our potus with North Korea.
Wrong.  Read her tweet again, it was at the India World Conference.  Why wouldn't the Chinese be invited they're right next to each other.
That says "Indiana" OMG learn how to freakin read. Ya know the state where the VP is from? WOW
The Vice President lives in Washington DC, you ignorant troll.
I understand that a BOT doesn't have the facts, but you must learn how to freakin read. I didn't say that the VP lives in Indiana, I did say that he is FROM Indiana. Ha ha you idiotic SNOWFLAKE
I don't know why anyone needs 100 plates anyways.  Just do the dishes every once in a while, right?
....When your husband loves these fabulous plates even more than you do...

You might be married to @VP
And there is something wrong with that?, it about art, not politics

As most know, my daughter was killed in the Parkland school shooting. Please sign the petition and ask VP Pence to become part of the solution for gun safety.

Jesus, do you not have anything better to do with your time?  You're in a position to make a difference in this world, do something constructive!
Remember.  Me & a trough
We love you Mrs Pence and Mr Pence!
do you know a single person of color?
Gosh, what sort of question is that? Look at the picture on the Indiana World Organization of China Painters list of officers: http://www.indianawocp.com/2017-2018-State-Officers.html …
omg...is buckwheat on the board?
Conservative morals and values!!!!
She was a model doing a photo shoot. The only modeling anyone would ask your liberal honey bunnies Michelle and Hillary to do would be for a live stock magazine.
Oh you pulling the race card Freddy? What else is new? Michelle O and Barack Hussein O are long gone and are not coming back. Get over it
Oh how lovely!

How white.

#AlfieEvans is about to murdered by UK gov't. Cold-blooded, state-imposed MURDER!! Please!! Please tell your husband @VP & @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to intervene b4 it's too late!! @WhiteHouse @seanhannity #Hannity @TuckerCarlson #Tucker #MAGA
.@realDonaldTrump We fought in WW2 to stop NAZI'S!!
SAVE #AlfieEvans from UK state-imposed MURDER!!!
YOU are his only hope! #prolife #catholic 
@FLOTUS @VP @WhiteHouse @KellyannePolls …
Shame on you both for not calling out the  morals and lack of values of Trump.  Guess cheating is okay and lying about it, politics over religion!
Awesome
How very nice. They could fetch a neat price at the "Keep Mike out of Jail" garage sale you'll be having in 2019.

NRA just had a strong month cause of dumb shots like you. Eat some bacon and try to be an American.
IF that made any sense at all....it might be funny. Instead, it's just pathetic. 

Try something real new next time you feel witty. 

It's called "Spellcheck".
Because being American means eating bacon? 
When you figure it out, let me know. 

Better yet....don't. I don't want to know.
Really making a difference in the world.
Yes, we are very proud of their work to Make Porcelain Plates Great Again.

Comgratulation Mrs Karen Pence 
Really I can see the love of culture in time
Would you spread for Baba Booey?
You should use @flotus as a model next time, I hear she poses great in the nude.
You mean....
Pathetic.....we really don’t need to hear from the fake Christian family....or should I say the King diddler wanna be

Any man that calls Johns wife mommy is sick
What a magnificent idea thanks for sharing

What a beautiful and gracious hostess you are!  Thank you so much for honoring us at your beautiful home!
Wow! Those are Gorgeous!
A beautiful addition to @VP Residents
How lovely
His hands say all I need to know about this event.
Beautiful plates
Those do look really nice Mother.
Beautiful!

Jessica Leeds…
Very cool   : )
How beautiful. How many children will they feed. Lord do SOMETHING that matters. Waste of polluted air.
.
Will you be trashing the plates representing blue States? 
Literally and figuratively?

Don't you just want the plates that represent the "real America"
.
Nice plates. Too bad our executive branch* bears only bad fruit.
.
Will the DofC be rented represented by an  or ?
Did you check the lead content?... or does it remind you of your childhood of eating paint chips...
So beautiful , Wow
The plates are beautiful! What a wonderful gift. 
Very enterprising, I like your plates too, well done.
What's wrong with this picture? 

Whites - 28
Minorities - 0
How homogenous of them
BEUTIFULL
To bad there was any Democratic participation. This us the worst Administration this country ever had!
very great
Oh! Just beautiful.
Build that wall now
#PutinsPuppet

So lovely. Porcelain plates. You are such a deep thinker.

"the residence"----which residence are you referring to?

Cool. Nearly half the country hovers at the poverty level, eating off of second-hand plates they got at a thrift store (if they do eat), but tells us more about how wonderful it is to be showered with luxuries for being a corrupt politician's wife.
Very nice you are a great person I can tell...God BLESS.
Beautiful plates.  What a thoughtful loving gift!!!
Karen How Can U As A Woman Let Ur Husband Say Such Nonsense? Are U Scared To Stand Up To Him? Does He Abuse/Beat U? Karen Do U Really Believe This What Ur Husband Said From My View And Everyone Associated With Trump..Pence Does Look Like An Abuser/Wife Beater
#IMPEACHPENCE
Wonderful heartfelt thanks karen!
Zzzz
Awesome!
So pretty

Pence **knew** about MishaFlynn’s close ties w/#Russia. These were a FEATURE, not a bug.

So although Flynn didn’t lie to Pence (no need), **Pence did LIE** to the press

Remember that Pence BEGGED for an interview by Mueller last summer.
So what are your thoughts on the RADICAL, WHITE, CHRISTIAN TERRORIST who gunned down the innocent people in the waffle house on 4/22/18? He was eventually arrested, but not shot, by police even though he was carrying a gun. Waiting for your response...
Painting plates? Nero fiddled while Rome burned.
Mrs, Pence 

Please join us in prayer for our President.

He needs it as do we all.

***Please read***
Maybe pray for that little girl?
You deplorables are monsters.
You are class lady
Your tweets amaze me. “Nothing to see here...life is beautiful....look at my paintings...” Keep that head in the sand Lady.
What are you talking about? I can see the plates! Take off your blinders!
Wow... beautifully done. Well done!
What, no thoughts and prayers for victims and families of Americans killed a gun in a waffle house?

Doesn't your Jesus care about black people killed by guns? Is the NRA more powerful than your ability to offer thoughts and prayers?
Bitter much?
SOS for VENEZUELA SOS
What a special day for these folks. 
Wonderful. 
Thank you.Mrs Pence
Beautiful
.@SecondLady @VP Who cares? Your husband & his American puppet master are practically humping each other with glee over people killed in Toronto because it might involve a Muslim. Never mind the 4 black people killed here or the black hero.

Are you ashamed of @VP? You should be.
@SecondLady , I am sure your graciousness & warmth filled the room. 
What wonderful gifts & such talent.
May the LORD richly bless you & @VP .
Thank you.
From #WeThePeople

Does President Trump deserve the Nobel Peace Prize after getting North Korea to shut down their missile tests?
You really are all about frivolous activities aren't you.....arts and crafts Lady!
Life without art its like walking without shoes.. Sometime people need some arts for a better lifestyle. 
they should have made 1 extra pair: one for each of your beautiful daughters ;)    Best regards, also to Mr. Pence.
Awesome! They look GREAT!!! Back Home, again, in Indiana........Enjoy! all of what Indiana has to offer in DC and, in the State.  Bravo! Congrats! Enjoy!
We YOU, Mrs. Pence! Keep up the good work.
. @RioLacey @SecondLady @VP No we don't.
Elles sont magnifiques!
Not a word about hero James Shaw jr
You seem very nice. How can you enable a pathetic sychophant who lauds every shittything the prez does? History will remember you
Gorgeous workmanship
And what’s the value of the plates?  Looks like way more than you are allowed to accept. Got a problem with ethics?  SEND THE PLATES BACK. I am reporting this illegal gift.
Thank you @SecondLady for sharing a lovely day.  So interesting seeing all the state flowers like this   #Hoosier4Ever 
What a wonderful gift they gave the United States! They look beautiful.
COWARDS
Don't we have American Painters who could have done the job???  What happened to Americans first???
Art Therapy.
Most. Worthless. Second. Family. Ever.
Is it true @SecondLady that Mikie wears your dirty panties as a nite cap for sleeping? I read it somewhere!!
Oh mother how wonderful! 
That is the coolest!!! 
And this is one of those moments in history too!!
How COOL is THAT!!!
China painters or klan leaders wives luncheon?
Not clan leaders, gay conversion therapists.
Make sure your hubby gets to give each plate a nice rim job ok?
The group picture looks Ike a DaVita commercial
You might even say you enjoyed a nice plate job.
The plates are beautiful ladies...

And something to share with each Vice President is very rememberable.
Omg. I hope not $0.01 of tax payer money was spent on that.
Lovely
When you can't get the Presidential Cabinet in Order, the Vice President orders China for his kitchen Cabinets. 
#flowerdiplomacy
Do something meaningful you boring 2nd lady. Come on
You are absolutely stunning @SecondLady
Are any of the plates gay
They look pretty happy to me
Beautiful. That's very special.
Absolutely beautiful 
How lovely.  The plates are beautiful!
What did they cost about a billion bucks?
This is really the most lovely thing I have seen on Twitter all day. The plates are beautiful. I am in awe of the china painters.
My great-grandma did this and tried to teach me.  I fell in love with quilting though.  Such great remembrances of her come to mind when I saw your tweet!   this!
Shut up, Karen with the plates.
Tell us how much you hate the orange menace, be honest, come out
This appears intimate and less Nouveau riche then gold plated everything....
Those will look great when you and your husband move into the White House.
How newsworthy! Sad.
Thank you @SecondLady! The plates are beautiful! 
Ugh
God bless America
I'm pretty sure that's a Camellia!! #Alabama
Very nice
I'm just in awe with these beautiful plates!   Thanks for constantly sharing your interesting life.  
Some Amerikans don't have enough to eat.
Is there one of your gay bunny?
Lovely Art Creations
Love seeing your gift for art in the White House. They all are so very blessed by you!
@PARISDENNARD, that's so nice that you retweeted this. I may not have seen it otherwise!

Beautiful
The plates are very beautiful!!!
@IndianaWorldChinaPainters Congratulations! Yay!! What beautiful artists you are. Such an opportunity and deserving! @SecondLady such class!
Yes, high morals and values. So much class!!!!!!!!!
Why don't you grow up!
That’s lovely
Another class act in the second lady. We are very lucky to have such class with the wife's of the President and VP
Mrs. Trump is the most trashiest, sorry, conservative class of them all.
Second Lady, you never get enough recognition for all you do for our nation.  Thank you for sharing this lovely event and for serving our nation.  God Bless you and the VP and these talented women and their dedication and love to art and our nation.
Do not abide an evil man.
Where're the Forget-Me-Not flowers for the State of Alaska? Would love to see them!
Beautiful and fun


Chlorpyrifos hurts the brain and lowers IQ, especially in kids, who also experience tremors due to the chemical. It's been linked to everything from cancer to Parkinson's. A study found the chemical in 87% of umbilical cord blood. Trump reversed its ban. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/chlorpyrifos-dow-environmental-protection-agency.html …
So awesome - they are America!
#cakedecorating I'M SURE THEIR VERY NICE. I saw how creative people could be when observing celebrants who had help of RESTAURANT ASSOCIATES @Newseum, DC. These minicakes were intricately designed like @uscapitol. Unfortunately rush caused damage to a few of the cake's domes.
Beautiful, all
So beautiful - what talented ladies.  A wonderful treasure for years to come.
What a beautiful tribute 
#Beautiful
beautiful job @SecondLady we love you!!
Very cool!

Beautiful plates. Lovely of you to host a reception for those talented ladies.
@vp @SecondLady Good Afternoon! Prayers you, @charlipence @realMarlonBundo and your family have a wonderful and safe evening...God Bless! 
Very nice
Class!  pure and simple.
How beautiful & how kind - you & @VP Pence must be delighted 
That is really a beautiful project. Would be great to see a pic of each plate.
Thank you for sharing. Didn’t know about this group, but it makes sense there are many dedicated artistic groups in Indiana. IN,USA 
Beautiful!
Dear Karen Pence-Beautiful-just like you and your Hubs-thank you for serving our Country with integrity, elegance, intelligence, grace and beauty
How is she serving? Is she down at the soup kitchen feeding the hungry or helping orphans find homes, is she helping people find affordable healthcare? She's not doing anything that helps anyone but herself and her family. So much for being a true Christian. Waste of tax money.
"We the plates! Thank you so much!"
Beautiful
Your great
Beautiful!
Great photo of the group. 
WOW!  My grandmothers used to hand paint china.   What a lovely gift for the nation.  Beautiful setting.
