With perhaps one exception, the group gathered behind @VP does not appear to be enthusiastically endorsing his speech.  And that one exception may be more a result of a malocclusion than agreement.
They are foreign workers on H1b visas from India. Tata is a outsourcing firm that has taken jobs from qualified American in IT, and given them to cheaper Indians on H1b visas.
here we have our very own VP Mike Pence who cannot praise Infosys enough for causing trauma to thousands of Americans using it's criminal methods. See for yourself. Do you know of anyone as shameless as our own Mike Pence?
I want to thank @SenToddYoung and @GovHolcomb for supporting the Trump agenda and for giving companies like @Infosys and many other companies the confidence to invest in Indiana and in America. 
I will NOT vote for Mike Pence. It’s a shame for all of these politicians who game the livelihood of American citizens. Republicans’ pro-business policies are ruining the country, with the foreign work visa programs.
Spread the facts using below tweet. Our politicians are telling us lies about the amount of money they are sending to India. All of this money thst we are borrowing from our future generations. If this doesn’t make american stand up for their rights nothing will. Spread the word.
You inflicted a big shame to American workers.Its time for TRUMP to fire you. Infosys is a poisonous snake & it's founder Narayana Murthy is the father of bodyshopping. Why not give confidence to local american companies to expand & hire US workers.
In the same Indiana, younger bro of Infosys (Cognizant) took the entire IT department from state auto insurance & fired 300 Americans in 3 months in 2014. now it is getting out of control with ur current decision
@Success87473781
Please bring #HR392 to the floor for voting if you truly care. It has 322 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle and raises $4 Billion from legal immigrants.
HERE IT IS AGAIN! BLATANT BRIBERY BY THE INDIAN CIMMUNITY! WE WANT SPECIAL TREATMENT & WE'LL PAY FOR IT! WORKS IN INDIA SHOULD WORK HERE RIGHT? WHY ARE INDIANS ALLOWED TO LOBBY CONGRESS? FOREIGNERS CAN'T DO THAT IN INDIA! INDIANS ALSO GOT H1B BY FRAUD! SHOULD VOUD GC APPLICATION!
We must ban all foreign lobbying NASSCOM, USIN-PAC, http://rhcusa.com  These are our enemies. Why should any foreign nation get a PAC in our country? It's OUR govt.
That was NOT what we voted you for!! You allowed an Indian body shop company like Infosys, that had brought in cheap labor H1b visa workers from India to flood our jobs and get qualified Americans laid off? Shame on you @VP !!
So where are all the Americans in that video? All I see are H1b Indians!
What a crock of . Infosys has been a huge cog in IT jobs moving offshore.
Not to mention how small of a piece of their hourly rate the worker actually gets.
@POTUS  #traders Importing FRAUDSTERS!!!! 

 WE DON'T WANT TO BE REPLACED BY FOREIGNERS.  Pink Slips at Disney. But First, Training Foreign Replacements. https://nyti.ms/1H02mFN  #NOH1B  #MAGA #AmericaFirst @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #NOHR392
All Americans ought to know that Trump and his #MAGA marketing is another grand hypocrisy, selling our people one person/family at a time. He listens to corporate operators over the pained citizens of the #USA. Read below.
INFOSYS HAS TAKEN AMERICAN JOBS AS WE SAT IN OUR OFFICES!! HOW CAN YOU SUPPORT THIS COMPANY!! TRAITOR!! @POTUS @FLOTUS @USCIS @STEPHENMILLERAL @ChuckGrassley @4US_WORKERS @michellemalkin @HANNITY @IngrahamAngle @AnnCoulter @LouDobbs @BreitbartNews @therealroseanne @RealJamesWoods
True it is their greedy business model, there are now thousands of company.  Government should take strict measures against these outsourcing companies.
@Tim_Canova Sorry, but this is The Low Point for the Trump Administration bordering on the level of @HilaryClinton. We need to invest in, educate, and train Americans and NOT be accomplices to our own destruction by unethical companies like Infosys who pretend to hire Americans.
Crony capitalism does not help the American worker.
Thanks for nothing. I am a US Citizen IT worker with 25 yrs experience...out of work for over a year.
Above is infosys new strategy to showcase fake US worker benefits in disguise .
They must have shared fake promises to Mike Pence to work in the best interest of US n US employees
So it is ok that companies like these abused the #visa program displacing #American workers & swindling #H1b workers with low wages? While both types of workers are put in #UseAndThrow model, these companies thrived.
Definitely not a #MAGA moment!
Damage is already done! Apu & US media characterizd evry Indian as ‘cheap labor’ & US govt endorsed stereotyping by putting high-skilled immigrants frm India to 70 years long green card wait compared 2 just 7 months wait for aliens frm other countries! (1)
…
Attorneys assist employers in running ads with goal of NOT finding any qualified Americans , & steps they go through to disqualify even qualified Americans to get  H-1b.Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant HCL are running fake ads in Sunday newspapers across the USA @realDonaldTrump
That was Indiana, USA??
It looks more like India!

@POTUS Invest in U.S. workers, not foreigners! Keep #MAGA promise to American workers!

End work visa fraud & misuse!
Let ordinary-skill work visas expire!
Keep per-country GC limits!
#revokeH4EAD #endH1B #NoH1B
#noHR392 #noS281
Yes tcs has strong hold there. Also cts and infosys is in every IT office.
An utter disgrace. At least Rome resisted the barbarians at the gates. We have them bribe our legislators who then open our labor markets for their easy exploitation with US workers relegated to retirement, Opioids, or minimum wage jobs. NOT MAGA.
What kind of #insanecountry brings its enemies in by the millions and give them its most important industry and technology for free. We are comitting suicide. India Incs must be removed from USA period.
Such shame @VP doesnt know @Infosys is taking jobs away from #Americans @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @USCIS @DHSgov #revokeH4EAD No #H1B No #H4EAD No #HR392 No #GreenCard #NoH1B #NoH4EAD #NoHR392 #NoGreenCard
#MAGA #AmericaFirst #buyamerican #hireAmerican  @RepKevinYoder @TulsiPress

Mike Pence just cost the 2020 re-election. Notice how there are foreign Indians behind him. Tata is an outsourcing company that many American workers in IT lost their jobs because Tata would provide cheaper foreign labor to replace them. Indiana should rename and become India.
There is still time for @VP & @realDonaldTrump to make good on #MAGA promise to end rampant work visa fraud & misuse!

Investigate & revoke all H1B/GC/USC that have participated in work visa fraud/misuse.

Keep per-country GC limits!
#revokeH4EAD #endH1B #NoH1B #noHR392 #noS281
#VP Why you are selling ? Don’t you know @Infosys track record in screwing & discriminating #AmericanWorkers, replace them w/ #questionable #cheapLabors? @POTUS this is against #MAGA #BuyAmericanHireAmerican promise you made

I want to thank midterms for a chance to flip the house and senate! #BlueWaveIsComing
Trump administration has been true to his agenda. I have never seen any genuine leader in a long time
Lol. Do you know what the company TATA is? Notice all the foreign Indian people behind Mike Pence? They all come here on H1b visas to replace American workers in IT jobs. That's the business model of TATA. TATA is an outsourcing company. Many Americans lost their jobs due to Tata
This picture have every American replacement

HEY MIKE, YOU OR DONALD STILL HAVE NOT MENTIONED THE SHOOTING AT THE WAFFLE HOUSE IN ANTIOCH. HOW ABOUT JAMES SHAW, JR THE GUY THAT HAUGHTED MORE PEOPLE FROM BEING SHOT BY ONE OF DONALD'S SUPPORTERS. HE DID IT SINGLE HANDED WITHOUT A GUN. I CALL HIM A HERO. WHAT ABOUT YOU & DJT??
Why invest in Indiana, anyway jobs will be taken away to india. Go invest in india directly . If in American then jobs should be given to american. Not for cheap labors
You'll be out of office and on your way to jail soon !!!

We crunched the numbers and our taxes will increase by $4,500 next year because of the GOP tax plan. I am a TV editor and my wife is a pediatrics intensive care nurse. 1 child. I'd say, "Thanks for nothing," but it's worse than nothing.
You fucked Indiana though, did you forget? 
#Jesus would not like you - his close personal friend #MikePence - defending & enabling this dishonest, immoral, corrupt man #DonaldTrump. #WhatWouldJesusDo ? Not tweet things like this.
disgrace!


CONGRATULATIONS INDIANA!! YOU ARE NOW REPLACED BY INDIANS #SOLDOUT
News from your home state. You were governor when these illegal acts were perpetrated upon the people of Indiana, correct?
BREAKING: Federal Court orders Marion County, Indiana to open satellite early voting sites for 2018 general election.  County GOP refused to allow them in Federal elections after Obama's win in 2008 in violation of US Constitution.  Congrats @CommonCause!

What vain assholery.  Obama didn't name-drop himself every time he tried to pass a policy.




What is your boss on speed this morning he sure sounded like it.?


Just take a look behind you, do you really see Americans???!!!!
How many???!!!!
One,two???!!!!!

End #H1B
Note the 100% #indians except for the ONE token white person. Does #mikepence even realize Infosys is in #EEOC violations? What a #racist company



Why are you happy to invite a company that pays a lower tax rate on $2 billion in profits than a family of four living on $60k a year?

And then there's toys r us and sam's club who are benefiting so much because of y'alls plans.

How about the steel mills how much did they give their employees
You know pence certin people respect me, and most people cant believe i cover with these girls that im trying the pleasentries two people can share, and im almost no matter how i try im going not to beable my future held in the space time continuem Sir/.
And causing ribs to crack is determined by punch depth, and force.
The thing about taking on a large swuad of men in 1 vs 15 is the time and placement to cause the most damage and pain. Which it's the pain that keeps them to the floor, not the damage Sir/.
I dont know why so many men have the reason to attack me and attempt imaginary settings that give the idea they hold the medal plattform over me. I dont like showing my exspertise, but im not afraid to Sir/.
Wait. You are actually saying that Infosys fulfills Trump's slogan "America first" ?
The guys in the male sinority program are ages25-34 they have jobs ranging from tv superstore to guys set up a level of trust with a girl they desire and its like a fertuturnity ritual like ki alpha i Sir.
Worst Vice President ever. Spineless!
Great. There goes all the American jobs. @USCIS Please hurry up!

Looks like the clown car out for night.

Thank you @Infosys
You're honestly the only VP I've ever liked lol I couldn't name Clinton's VP. And honestly history only remembers ford as a VP because he was the only president not voted for. I wholeheartedly respect you Vice President Pence. You're a good man, and in a non homo way, I love you
