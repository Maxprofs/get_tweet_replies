She is the smart one... she is the one that realizes the true economic drivers are the poor and middle class who HAVE to spend their money to survive, not the rich who might choose spend their money on a trinket. She also sees a corporate handout when she sees one.
It is no wonder ... the dems have one main agenda .... tax and spend for big federal government!
. @VP @SenatorBaldwin Now you're at it, too.

Give it up. Lord Dampnut has destroyed the republican party. You all will lose your precious sense of power.
Gee, maybe he objected to the billions going to billionaires

@SenatorBaldwin 
The iranian people have trusted you. If you do not cancel the barjam traitor to the nation.
Thank you Tammy Baldwin for understanding economics!

If by “your taxes” you’re referring to the taxes of rich people, then yes, she voted not to hand out a massive tax windfall to rich people on the backs of the middle class & poor. #StopLying #JesusHatesLiars, but you’re a #republichristian, so greed/corruption are your religion.
BECAUSE IT ADDS TO THE DEFICIT DUMBASS
Remember, Bernie has a plan that if you can't find a job the government will give you a job. Nevermind the government is broke.
I don't know what Senator Tammy Baldwin stands for?  What has she did in the last 6 years that was good for Wisconsin?  No seriously, I want to know.  Oh yeah, I know she doesn't like President Trump... whoop da doo..
Tammy loves bolshevism and money. Immoral supporter of various sinister legislation with misleading titles.  https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/447/cosponsors …

Kanye West has broken free from the mental prison of the left. Liberals hate diversity of thought... They are enraged when a black man in America voices opinions that are contrary to the liberal narrative. Keep fighting #Kanye. Don’t let the left control you. #MAGA
Quit lying you did not do anything for the Poor or the Middle Class your TAX CUTS WERE FOR YOU TRUMP YOUR RICH DONORS AND YOUR RICH FRIENDS...SO QUIT LYING

Chlorpyrifos hurts the brain and lowers IQ, especially in kids, who also experience tremors due to the chemical. It's been linked to everything from cancer to Parkinson's. A study found the chemical in 87% of umbilical cord blood. Trump reversed its ban. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/chlorpyrifos-dow-environmental-protection-agency.html …
Beware of wolves in sheeps clothing....
What a smart man is Baldwin!
This man is brilliant God lead


@SenatorBaldwin should be praised for standing up for her constituents instead of the GOP Lies.
Senator Baldwin should be Thanked for voting NO on the GOP Middle Class Tax Rape.
GIve the business billions, so the wokring class sees pennies on the thouseands of dollars that the greedy see.
Cutting taxes wasn’t the solution, please help the poor in America, my family has been here since 1624 on mayflower, now we struggling.
This is what She voted against!
Maybe she wanted money to educate children.
Because she knew these tax cuts would not benefit the people.
Vote Republican in 2018
@VP this is why Tammy @SenatorBaldwin voted no!

Tax cuts, spending to raise U.S. deficit to $1 trillion by 2020, CBO analysis shows
Tammy Baldwin ---> 
This is inappropriate.
Most haven’t seen the benefit you’re lying about.

That's because @SenatorBaldwin knew your 'tax cut" was a #GOPTaxScam.  She was  too smart to fall for your fiscally irresponsible bullshit.
Wisconsin now has a State Income Tax that can no longer be deducted from Federal Income Taxes.
Deflect much, Mr.VP?


And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear:  your hands are full of blood.
Wash you, make yourself clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes: cease to do evil.
Isaiah 1:15-16
Cutting taxes is the biggest myth that Republicans and conservatives have visited upon this nation. It smacks of “we don't need to pay for good government”.  The monstrous deficit has grown from these demon seeds planted by cheapskates masquerading as conservatives.

An analysis by The AP shows the nation's six big Wall Street banks saved at least $3,590,000,000 in taxes last quarter, thanks to the recently enacted Trump tax law. https://apnews.com/96589643061e4437bd45fdcc35959fe0 …
Thank God for @SenatorBaldwin

How many people could have health care for $3.59 billion? Child care? A college education? Housing? Food? https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/987325029393293313 …
Yay Tammy!
Going down! Flynn moving in!

If Senator Baldwin is Democrat? That is why the prejudicial Pence Trump administration objects to him. They want to dictate everything to their favor. But none of their policy is in favor of average American welfare.
What Pence is doing is glomming your emotions with lies like Trump etc. and hooking you with their agenda of misinformation: like the Russian/Cambridge hacking. Well I'm trying to also do that to counter what I think is POTUSES lies! I don't trust them!

How much profit did Wisconsin companies make because of your tax cuts that have yet to filter down to the average Wisconsin citizen?
Tammy Baldwin is doing her job by voting 2 protect the people of Wisconsin. The tax bill was a bad deal for the middle class but, supports the 1%. UR negative & insulting tweet proves she is doing her job. U should be ashamed for your attempt to discredit her bc she is a Democrat
Apparently she is the only one from Wisconsin smart enough to get it right
R U really out there saying negative things about a Veteran who lost limbs in service to this country & who is a brand new mom? #GoToHell!
Please grow a pair and make Donald leave office for keeps, enough is enough. I know this will cause damage to a lot of standup comedians but they already have trump material enough to last for decades.
So the Governor of Wisconsin, REPUBLICAN SCOTT WALKER has NO CULPABILITY in the decline of the State? That's absolutely senseless.
Need our tax many for their own programs uses.
Pants on fire.
Are you making political/campaign statements on your official government account again?   You know that’s a no-no.  Mommy will be mad.
She voted against your trillion dollar tax scam. That's a good thing. Repeating lies will never make it truth.
I got my tax cut!
 Pence. Pence. Pence is complicit.
All thanks to the Republicans
Borrowing has gone up since your circus came to town now the deficit is spiking and for no reason except to give to the rich, this congress is also going down as the most fiscally irresponsible in our history
GOP-party of no. Party of hate. Party of tearing things down. 

Has no answers....just hate.

.@mrod21mvp
Remember this?
Destroying evidence is a felony.
Obstructing justice is a felony.…
Could it be that her no for the tax cuts was because she realized it wasn't going to help her constituents. And she's not out to support the big corporations like you are. Unless you're a multi-millionaire or Corporation very true Americans normal Americans see the tax cuts
Wisconsin will once again save Americas ass by voting with President @realDonaldTrump vote conservative Wisconsin.

God help us..Not just one Pence but two...the same white Q-Tip..
Another Pence Runs for Congress- BUT His Business Record Raises Questions...Lawsuits, Bankruptcies...
#BlueWaveComing2018
Hey Mike, telling lies is a sin and treason is a felony. Both you and your buddy @realDonaldTrump are going to jail for the felony part.
Senator Baldwin voted no to the explosion of the defecit by the GOP tax cuts for corporations and the super rich.
Perhaps she didn’t want to add 1 trillion to deficit?
She's a combat veteran. When did you serve?
No comparison. @SenatorBaldwin is a true American Hero who didn't fall for the #GOPTaxScam that the vast majority of Americans see as a mistake.
link it and not from brietbart or fox.

Tammy Baldwin is part of the uniparty's controlled opposition that refused to do anything about Bush's illegal wars. #MAGA
I'd love to see Mike Pence in the Whitehouse after Trump for 8 years.
ONLY 0.9333% OF WISCONSIN WORKFORCE SAW ANY BENEFIT FROM YOUR TAX SCAM...less than 1%. We see the truth you liar. MOTHER IS ASHAMED OF YOU. #PenceNotXtian #yousuck
Your tax cuts SUCK PENCE!  My paycheck is SMALLER and my insurance went up 50%!!!!!!!!!!

#FuckPence #PenceKnew #LyingPence
when are you coming out Mickey? I am sure mother knows already!
What is her message anyway? Obstructionists
Tax bill is a big scam. Rich got richer, companies are doing stock buy backs, interest rates are going up, and the middle class will again pay. Trickle down does not work. Your alternative Christian faith of #MoneyOverMorals is a sham
I am sure that you are brilliant.
Good for you. Not economics or spelling and grammar. Funny! Point made
Wow, a bit of self promotion. Hope you feel real good about yourself. Now run along and have some Kool-Aid and pat yourself on your 3 degree back. I am just overwhelmed with your greatness...

And now back to .....
QUIET UNETHICAL PIECE OF SH^IT!
We crunched the numbers and our taxes will increase by $4,500 next year because of the GOP tax plan. I am a TV editor and my wife is a pediatrics intensive care nurse. 1 child. I'd say, "Thanks for nothing," but it's worse than nothing.
I applaud her for that. The tax cut only benefits rich HOP donors and the Trump family?!
Is the Candyman giving you samples? You are delusional Pence!!
I guess leftists want to go back to this.


You mean add $1.5 TRILLION to the deficit in tax cuts aimed at big businesses and the rich? Jeez, the "fiscally responsible" GOP has left the building.
How about we stop cutting govt revenues with tax cuts for rich people and companies that just hoard it overseas anyway and use it to create jobs by building/repairing infrastructure across the country?

Mike here is lying, because the #GOPTaxScam was about cutting HIS taxes, and screwing the middle class with higher insurance premiums and eventually higher taxes.


Which traitor is that? I'm old enough to remember on Obama's last day in office, he pardoned a terrorist that bombed and killed Americans on our own soil. He's the only traitor I see.
Smart move voting no on “tax cuts” for the rich. @SenatorBaldwin America will support you.
Dude, you're in the wrong state if you think Wisconsin is the battleground in these midterms. You should try Tennessee instead.
He’s in the wrong century. Or on the wrong planet.
Get over it.
Sorry she stays you go.

That's all a matter of perspective.
