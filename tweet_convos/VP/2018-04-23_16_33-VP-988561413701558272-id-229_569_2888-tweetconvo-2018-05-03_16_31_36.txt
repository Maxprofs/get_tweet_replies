There’s no way... no... way... possible that was productive
Vice President Pence is doing what he does best.He prays and then takes care of USA Business! Awesome job Sir. God Bless You and Your Family with every good gift. 
Why are you blubbering about prayer on a tweet about science, and furthermore NASA was doing better before Trump Admin. Also while we're on the topic, prove your god exists.
Climate change. deal with it or get out of the way
Clown
You might not be aware of it, but we are all in space and you are lacking behind!
So what are your thoughts on the RADICAL, WHITE, CHRISTIAN TERRORIST who gunned down the innocent people in the waffle house on 4/22/18? He was eventually arrested, but not shot, by police even though he was carrying a gun. Waiting for your response
Because that has what to do with NASA?
If he had made a statement about this violence elsewhere, I would have commented there. But since it is being ignored, this seems like a good place to remind him. Your opinion of my actions is irrelevant.
We still can’t launch an astronaut into space. That duty goes to Russia.
That should be resolved by the end of 2018 or early 2019. @SpaceX and @Boeing are working on their own capsules (spacex both capsule and booster). Should be pretty exciting to not have to pay Russia $81 million per seat to the @ISS_CASIS
I thought you thought the earth was flat?
That was Christopher Columbus
NASA going in right with new leadership to Moon and Mars. This will create new technology revolution. High technology companies will be produced, creating millions more jobs in the future.
So let's guess. After Trump takes over America, he plans to take over the universe cosmos & galaxies too? 
We need to be the leader on ending animal abuse. America is a leader, not a follower. Get tougher on animal abuse issues.
There is nothing "productive" about any meeting with this boring gentleman!
It’s unbelievable the number of cabinet positions that have been filled by morons!!
We are truly screwed!!  Making America gag again!!
**cough** SPACEX **cough**... I feel like half the commenters on this either don’t know, forget, or choose to ignore the existence of SPACEX... wonder why... you hate big government but cheer for this???

Leading in what? our currently non-existent human capable launch vehicle or the hodgepodge useless SLS vehicle that will be outdated before it sits on a pad?
Get us back to manned space flight on NASA spacecraft and stop paying the commies to bum rides on their cold war antiquated gumball machine rockets!
Look around...we are the commies now.   
The Bernie supporters & Dems sure are.  I’m a dyed in the wool, God Bless America, Capitalist
Oh look...someone that believes a magic fairy in the sky is going to save the planet when we destroy it.  
Though the wicked join forces, none of them will go unpunished.
You know what would be particularly supportive of NASA? A Director with an advanced science background. #DidGodTellYouToLieToAmericans ?
For NASA, it's an Administrator, not a Director.  The fact that you got that wrong shows how little you know about NASA...
Yeah, the correct title is the important bit. 

Hahahahha such intellect. Did you get a BA in the humanities or some shit?
Going to need to find a planet B, because of reckless and disregard to mother earth enviroment. Is it possible the last 50 years what is unidentified flying is ours and plan to start else where?
ALMIGHTY GOD is not mocked.
Knock that off!
Yeh....but India also
But you're anti science. How will this work?
They came for the Jews, but I wasn't Jewish so I said nothing. Recall that little bit of wisdom? The same is true for science. Just because the Trump administration favors NASA doesn't release you from the obligation to resist their utter destruction of other scientific agencies.
I don’t understand...truly, if he doesn’t believe in science why is he anywhere near NASA? You can choose which science to believe in!?
“The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.”
Neil deGrasse Tyson


When were we not leading in space? After 1958, I mean.
Maybe since Obama canceled the shuttle program and our astronauts had to pay the Russians for trips to the space station?
First of all, Bush cancelled the shuttle in 2004. And what other nation has been consistently sending probes and satellites to explore the solar system? I know, facts are optional for Trumpers but most of us reside in a reality-based world.
we always were, you anti-science pig.
Hmm Trump's vision is distracted by porn stars and NASA have a reputation for spending money faster than a Kardashian and getting equal results. Now I'm hearing you're a creationist? These aren't good ingredients... The private sector are going to lead not any nation.

You two certainly have plenty of it.
Who cares about NASA when 20 trillion US debt bomb is about to ignite a reversal Big Bang anihilation ? @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @MELANIATRUMP
EMERY SMITH - UNDERGROUND BASES - ET AUTOPSY - DISCLOSING the SECRET SPACE PROGRAM... https://youtu.be/EXPPH9n-Dk4  #QAnon @realDonaldTrump
Are they investigating the large space between your ears?
“Take off that ridiculous lid.”
Trump only has visions while delusional. Often.
My..my...how White male the room looks.
Did you prove the World is Round?
I'm glad you are taking NASA under your wing. I think it was abused and politicized by the last administration. Get them back to what they should be doing and let's get back to the moon and on to Mars.
Yes... the team paying Russians for rides to the ISS
Difficult to say you’re  leading if you can’t put a man in orbit.
Nice you show up once in a while....People forget very easily....

Also good to see you at #SS34 #SpaceSymposium sir.
@MattOBJ
What important factors did you discusse to help America and not the World (because you don't have the great ability to make friends with your enemies)
(Jokes on me,you are the enemy that has so much power,I cannot do nothing about but hope you can read this)
(Money does not save)
College Spam taught what to think, not how to THINK!!! Just Obey your President Trump.....OBEY !!! Get over yourself oh I'm sorry! Get over Crooked Hillary losing even when y'all CHEATED. See Hillary could do nothing right without Billy.

NASA needs REAL leadership, Cuckie. Not the idiot Bridenstine. He's unqualified...as are you, the "president" and every cabinet member, to sell girl scout cookies.
Pence approves of NASAs new, J-C White 3:16- Heaven exploration rocket.
Anybody know any good AltNASA accounts?   These tweets are nauseating.

good
You liberal Democrats are so cheerful! You put your faith in a fabricated Democratic lie and it's about to crumble. The investigation about the real Russian collusion and payoffs will begin. It won't end well for Hillary and the DNC. Can we say boomerang!
After the era of Sputnik/Gargarin, America has always led in space. Now we have an unqualified science denier running the agency; I hope the damage is minimal and not long-lasting.
Climate-change deniers aren't qualified to discuss science or technology, much less lead NASA. You're all manifestly guilty of crimes against humanity.
Climate change is fake news...oh yes you believe in that....not you fault...Shows you been to college...yes taught WHAT to THINK, NOT HOW TO THINK!!!
College Spam! Perfect!
US New Space Era in action! US New Aviation Era in action! Go NASA! Go Team Trump/Pence! Go US!
Trump appointed a science denier to head NASA and cut funding so I don't know what you're so excited about. You're a little slow aren't you?

This has nothing to do with putting someone in space, and everything to do with getting rid of the last vestiges of climate change.  #dotard
Resign
You don’t believe in science so why go there? It is insulting to all the brilliant and hardworking scientists at nasa
I didn't know @VP knew that space existed! Good work!! So proud
Have they found the firmament yet? Or the pillars?
NASA is fucked.
... so what's the plan then? Find a replacement planet?
they're in the ass.köcsög
beast
Your leadership will only lead into the void!
You don’t even believe in science... why bother?!

#TrumpOfTheDay
What a waste of money.

1.9 million people no longer capable of getting food stamps & you are doing your white thing.
Maybe they could you send you and Donnie Two Scoops to the MOON.....one way ticket of course!

What the heck do you actually do ?
Oh, the same Fake NASA with moon  landing farce, space station... That NASA!
U a tard
Uhh you still trying to get a man on the moon?  It’s been done.
W/ @Potus' vision?  Are you f'n kidding me?f His vision is Trump centered only.  Maybe you can convince him to launch into space.
The new NASA guy is as incompet as you and the rest of the clowns in the WH! What a sham you've made of America! It will take years to dig out from under your poop pile!
You're a creationist and the NASA appointee is an ignoramus. You both disgrace NASA and the country. Don't talk about science; you're an idiot, and unworthy.
He can have his beliefs as long as he keeps NASA moving forward.

I'd like to see you win an election and do so.
Maybe the fine men and women @NASA deserve to be lead by a man of science. Not a potatoe with dead brain cells and embezzler of nonprofits. Just saying.
Always #Resist #TrueBelievers
The Indiana Stooge, and Least Curious VP in modern history never read about NASA and its decades of great Works — the Indiana Stooge should not be anywhere near NASA.

Remove Trump and the Indiana Stooge and vote complicit GOP Out.
Lot of progress has been made since Jan 2017, but media won't admit. Still lot of work needs to be done to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #AmericaFirst
How much was NASA’s budget cut in the @POTUS last proposed budget?
Something along the lines of $560 million less than 2017, wasn’t it?




College Spam. Are you still crying over Crooked Hillary? YES COLLEGE SPAM only know what to think instead of HOW.....lol











Great News!!! Believe it or not this will help accomplish that
What did that trip cost the country and how does the country benefit from that cost? Flynn Jr. Says that there was no lie. Who’s lying?
As a person that worked in the aerospace industry that is a wonderful thing! With the  technology today and are extraordinary people we have, we will be able to go anywhere soon!!
We'll be launching rockets with rubber bands by the time you're through wrecking this agency.
I feel nauseous.

We need to colonize Mars
Yay!!!
You have no credibility you have nothing to say you sold your soul to the devil I wonder how God's going to see that
Then can we build a space station that doesn't look like pvc pipe with Budweiser cans attached to it. It really looks like a piece of junk. Stop money to other countries and spend it here in America on American projects.
First off, @POTUS has no vision except to watch Faux and Friends. And as for you, you’re just looking for a hot astronaut.
Pence is always attending meetings. It appears that he is purposely being kept away from the White House. When will he open his eyes?
How about Climate Change, Jesus?
Book a flight to Uranus.
Pray for President Bush 
No thanks. I think if I was going to pray regarding Bush I would pray with the Iraqi families who's loved ones he killed and pray that he dies slowly and painfully.
America no longer leads in anything.  Our world standing is in the toilet and  we are no longer a functioning democracy.   #ImprisonTrumpPence MAGA ASAP.
Exactly WHY DONALD J TRUMP was elected.  To repair the DAMAGE done by Barrack HUSSEIN Obama.
Tell me specifically what damage Barack Hussein Obama did to this country and tell me specifically what Trump has done to correct it .
You learn what "do not touch" means yet?
Are you lost and lonely! Feel free to go to the airport.....Troll wanted on run way after dark. Isn't that you style hidden ohhhhh...after dark what ever. Joint The NRA after you repent and then learn to be happy.
Um, what does that mean, Mike, 'leading in space again'? When haven't we since the '60s? Ooooh, right; Mike is stuck in the '50s!

#PenceKnew
"Vision."  Does he even know what NASA does, you ridiculous liar?
 #Obama ruined the Space Program. Because he lacked any vision. You have a lot of work to do. #MAGA
Please, you’re a fucking joke.  You just hired some stupid fuck who knows nothing about science to lead NASA.  PULL YOURE HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS!
I look.up to America  for being ahead
Maybe they'll look for your head in Uranus.
#LyingPence has to make everything sound like it is Dear Leader's brilliance that is making things different. Trump is anti-science. NASA does well since they have smart people there, despite Trump.
WoW that was perfect like a real college Student and beyond... COLLEGE SPAM taught what to think not how to Think!!!!

This.

Please God, let the James Webb Space Telescope escape the earth's gravity before these right-wing monkeys figure out what it is and make border wall parts with it. NASA patriots: send all the source code to the European Space Agency.
We better lead in space since you are destroying our Earth.
Fake
Very fake 
Extremely very fake-Christian
Again?
If Trump was there he would be telling everyone that he is an astronaut and had the greatest mind ever,
Not for long
Vision, you say? Your hapless fawning, @VP, will be remembered when smoke on the disastrously corrupt and indecent administration that you participated in clears. You, sir, were, are, and will always be complicit in the constitutional crisis that your dear leader orchestrated.
Hey VP Pence, Your brother, Greg, is up to his eyeballs in debt. He might not be the best choice to run for Congress.....just sayin’.
With the idiot you have chosen it won't belong before you have a crisis on your hands. Climate denier to boot. How embarrassing for the USA.
@VP  Way to go!! We all are so proud of you!! Keep up the good work. God Bless you and yours.
So you actually believe the premise for Pence's tweet that some how he and Trump helped NASA even though they cut funding to NASA? Your "Keep up the good work" comment leaves the impression that you actually believe Pence did something or is somehow doing work.
Specifics please. What has been done in the last 15 months to transform the US from a follower to the leader in space? Which countries was America behind in 2016?
How? You guys are going to need science to achieve this!

Trump's vision for NASA: Harvest all the cheese from the moon.
Hey, if there's a profit to be made go for it!
It took 60 years but the Soviet Union (Russia) has finally fired back after NASA managed to bankrupt them during the space race.  Congrats for your roll in destroying America @VP.
If that is so, why has #Drumpf slashed @NASA budget?
Can you go to the moon with the orange nightmare and stay?
Mr. Vice President, myself a Hoosier, and behalf of many a great people, why are you not more vocal on Mr. Pompeo? #MAGA
Go read your NIV again
Oh just stop. You just installed a lying NON-SCIENTIST to run one of our already great country’s greatest scientific agencies. You people are despicable.

Trump's and vision do not belong in the same zip code much less same sentence .
Go away seriously
Do they have special NASA crayons for you?
BS and you know it! ;-)
How to put this? Oh...
YOU NEED A SCIENTIST RUNNING NASA.
Way to make it sound like @NASA was just scraping by until today… 
It was under Hussein.
When it comes to the 'space race' the JFK administration comes to mind. "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." Thank you guys for your hard work. #MAGA
Wow, you sir are the prime example of
