no this is lying to america and getting caught week!!


God Pence

Truly amazing what we're seeing in America under this President and Vice President. This Administration is a huge blessing for the world
The Deep state has taken years to desensitize the world but we're waking up.
This alone is bigger than most people know.

God bless

And of course there are the Syrian refugees, also fleeing an oppressive regime.  Your boss' response is to stiff-arm them, because... they're not Christians, so their lives don't matter.
My dad flew corsairs n the Korean conflict 52 53. 69 missions. Captn thurston gilchrist. His memoirs were incredible to read after he passed. He loved this USA . What I remember most was he left with dark brown hair. Returned totally gray . And deaf. God bless u dad. Love u

So it's totally okay to bring politics into sports when it suits you, but kneeling NFL players are disrespectful?
Absolutely
to defend #sharriffArpaio you are not a Christian you have no values you are not a real Republican and you know better
. @VP So how many should we grant asylum to? Oh, you can sympathize but not be altruistic in deed?

You are the most unchristian Christian ever. Your the antichrist... ian.

Your saying,” working on denuclearization...” but what I’m hearing is The Trump Administration just weeks ago requested $24 billion to upgrade US nuclear weapons and defenses...so no, not much work really?
It's hard to take you serious after AZ trip fawning all over Arpaio & forgetting what the Rule of Law is all about.
Stay Tuned for the next episode of ...
"The Fall Of Mike Pence"
Lying hypetcrit Mike , God is watching you.
Vice President Pence would you please help my family-Bryce and Maryl Wilks bring their adopted children home from Nigeria? Please intervene and ask the American consulate in Lagos to grant their legally adopted children visas to come home to the US. Please
Thank you VP .God bless you. We ,Koreans remember  your mind that you showed us when you came to Korea at the winter Olympics. I trust you,Trump.

The more important issue than denuclearization is the socialistic revolution  by Moon. Moon recently ordered to demolish defense walls on the border which was built to protect armored vehicles and tanks from North. Moon promised to give $200 billion to Kim at the Summit Talk.
When you say "we", who is that exactly?
Dear Mr Vice President, please don’t forget the evil China which is much more deceptive and threatening than North Korea.  They murdered the Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaoyi just like North Korea did to Otto.


Remember Pearl Harbor
Some are on your southern border.

Meanwhile, at our southern border, we have a group of people seeking asylum, who fled oppressive regimes, in search of a better life.  Your boss' response is to demonize them.
"In case the Vice President has forgotten – Joe Arpaio was accused of flagrant civil rights violations, and when a court ordered him to stop, the Arizonan ignored the instructions."

- @MaddowBlog's  @stevebenen
How about "it would be great for KOREA and the world"?
So you only feel badly for oppressed Koreans.  Mighty Christian of you Mikey.
Or just being played by North Korea. Why was Otto wandering around North Korea in first place?
It would, my only worry is how Kim can explain away NK Propaganda to his people. Will the people accept or rise up
Too bad you blocked others from oppressive regimes from entering Indiana.
The only thing you are working on is destroying America.  #BASTA
About your lying ass up. You guys have LIED ON THE KOREANS, THREATEN KIM, and had AMERICA IN FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN ONLY TO HEAR YOU LIE MORE ABOUT HOW GREAT YOUR REPUBLICAN STATE IS NOT.
Он как Саадам Хуссейн откажется от ядерного оружия, а потом его точно так же повесят? Грустно констатировать, но уважительно в мире относятся лишь к странам, где много эффективного оружия.
How about 's illegal nuke program? Shall we denuclearize  next?
Did it freak you out sitting so close to so many women?

You were helping their scouts.
My father and an uncle were decorated for serving in the Army during Korean War before I was born. Aboard a guided missle destroyer I visited Korea in 1976 and never felt closer to war. Let that be the last visit bearing arms that my family needs to make. Make peace in Korea.

No one should give trump any type of credit for what's happening in regards to North Korea, it was eventually going to happen no matter who happened to be in office.
Thank you.

Illegitimate president and administration
Fake VP
Fake Human
Fake Christian
How about your oppressive beliefs toward women, gays, minorities and probably animals?  You are a sick, hateful man who doesn't belong in politics.  And to all of you "believers" -  your day of reckoning is coming.
WTH is NK Freedom week ?
It would be great for America and the world if you and #FakePresident @realDonaldTrump would immediately resign.
Wait is it #smallbusinessweek or #NorthKorea freedom week? Nah. it's I'm always right week.
I  just Read  what people answer u .  ...may God protect u from the evil    be  strong  and bold God is with u
What  your doing is great job for all north korea  be blessed and success in all your  way

How about the poor people at the border "defecting, who fled their oppressive and dangerous environment" who are trying to save their families?  DO THE RIGHT THINGS.
They are lawless pepole! They can stay in. Mexico! They are away from thier country there!#nomore
That's one perspective. They are also victims of a horrific society trying to protect their families and SURVIVE.  I agree that we should have alternative solutions - because, frankly, NONE of these people really want to leave their homes or countries. This is not easy for them.
When we have millions of homeless, baltimore schools with no heat! Kids going hungry, I do NOT pay taxes for non- american citizens that dont like where they liveclean it up here first

Keep up the awesome work VP Pence, We appreciate all that you are doing

Man of God  Give freedom to North Korean
Wouldn't it be nice if refugees from all countries, where they are oppressed and threatened, had a welcoming , sympathetic country to welcome them? That used to be America. It no longer is.
Wouldn’t it be nice if they came here and did it the right way instead of illegally and deal drugs and commit crimes and the American people pay for them to live here illegally
Don’t forget Don’s older brother and his family!
You still think you can de-nuke North Korea?
They are so getting ready to play you.
Your sad attempts to appear presidential cos you know Trump is a criminal who will have to resign at some point here are all in vain, Mikey boy.
You are going down too.
Have a nice day.
A dream I hope comes true!
and the Trumpies are "so moved" that they'll give NK whatever it wants.  Thanks for validating a dictator, torturer, and liar. 
But hey, that's what the GOP supports
Sure Jan!
@Italians4Trump The justice of countries around the world will thank President trumunremitting efforts!
Justice will prevail over evil!
Comrade Bot.   Love the grammar.
What wld be great for America is u and trump leaving before u kill America
I can't hear past your hatred and bigotry
seria uma vitória do bem sobre o mal. o  mal em pensamentos, antes do mal em ação prática. @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @SecondLady @FLOTUS @TiffanyATrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump
Fake doctor report. Fake news conferences. Fake Veep.
ur a goat alright
In 10 years you can tell us about all the stories you’ve heard from all the Americans living abroad who have fled your fascist regime
How bad must Otto’s parents feel that @POTUS was elects a year too late.  Sad.
Otto Kunz: Olanta was at The Power...Alberto was UNT worker...Taki.Vitalicia was very American people.Reagan:Lady Oscar:Steve
Oh get off it... You're not fooling anyone. You cannot distance yourself from your complicity in 45's conspiracy against the United States with foreign agents. Mueller has paperwork for you too!
And yet you sneer at any refugee at our borders only seeking to work and have an opportunity for a better life, or to flee from a dangerous leader. Jesus weeps for you.
I'm mean, he str8 puts Tim Kaine to shame y'all.
We need to have faith in kim, mike! He will make history in friendship. Trust!
Moved by those who fled an oppressive regime.  Then moves to turn away those fleeing an oppressive regime.
when are you coming out the closet cup cake?. Mother knows anyway!
Mother isn't afraid of I'm cheating with another woman, it's the men.
God Bless North Korea
Go Mike! This is 1 Jesus freak I like y'all.  He's good.  Just listen to him speak y'all.
Are you talking about the kind of "peace" where people hate gays while hiding their own homosexuality? Ask your mom if you're allowed to answer that.

Infrastructure week is going great! Your boy tRUmp is decompensating, tho’ You may want to call Mueller sooner rather than later
yes.
NK has the potential to churn out good things in time.  Think Samsung, Hyundai, etc.
Your Christian act has always been phony, now we know just what a fraud you really are. You truly are a disgusting human being.
THANK YOU @VP  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!  

I remember that meeting- I made you go while I golfed!  Smart!
Just going to leave you a shirtless photo of #Obama because there is nothing like a sexually attractive younger black man that will make you feel more insecure about both your life and sexuality
And smart! So very intelligent 
Thank you for following the lead of Bill Clinton in his meeting with the North Koreans! I'm sure we can all agree Bill Clinton deserves the Nobel Peace Prize!
You endorse a crooked sherrif, how are supposed to listen to your evil, greedy intentions?
..you sound sinless..maybe you should b Sheriff
Ha. Read the bible. PENCE and Arpaio are evil. Racism is evil in my bible.
Bible? Who said anything about the Bible? Ur preaching intolerance of free will. I might add God judges people & motives
Separate church and state, you mentioned sin. You did. Not me. I mentioned law.
no u mentioned the Great VP supporting evil..u forgot to separate it
Evil isn't confined to the rules of the bible for fuck's sake
and law is not based on emotion..the only people that attack our POTUS/VP r muslim and lunatics
What @VP do you know about freedom? You are want to control the behaviors of others according to YOUR STANDARDS, that's not freedom! Gods GIFT OF FREE WILL is freedom! Unless you decided God was wrong for that GIFT!
I remember your resolve face, #FuckingMoron 
“I thought it was important that we went outside,” he said. “I thought it was important that people on the other side of the DMZ see our resolve in my face.”
When, in the middle of the week, you realize the week was not named.
The previous administration failed to do in eight years what you did in a year and a half! Congratulations !
GOD
....
Shame on you, spreading and working your propaganda on the death of Otto
Are you talking about immigration?
The first VP in US history who applauded a man running a US concentration camp-j arpaio. Screw U Pence
Unless they're from Honduras. I hear they form caravans!
Would #Jesus call @RealSheriffJoe a tireless champion?
Why don't you open up your Bible and let us know?
It would be great for America and the world if you would #RESIGN sooner than later.
good sir
The United Nations should put sanctions on Israel until they give up their nuclear weapons and submit to inspection of their nuclear facilities.
Arpaio is a criminal and a scumbag, how dare you honor him, you traitor!
Awesome! Thank you for being our Vice President. You are appreciated!
Happy North Korea Freedom Week, everybody!
Happy North Korean Freedom Week! For this year's celebration, we should all call on Bill Clinton to win the Nobel Peace Prize for successfully arranging talks with the rogue regime there!
Relax @VP , it was just locker-room talk

#hypocrites
You’re  a degenerate if you think EVERYwhere is a locker room. At least conservatives know where that talk belongs.



Reminder: Joe Arpaio once faked an assassination attempt, then framed a man for it — all to win sympathy for his reelection campaign. The innocent man spent 4 years in jail. Taxpayers footed the $1 million settlement. https://twitter.com/nbcnews/status/991448021169852417?s=21 …
