Thoughts and prayers for Dr. Ronny Jackson, Mike?
No, he's saving his prayers for the NRA (I bet there will actually be a prayer at this meeting).
According to @VP's figures, #TCJA tax law benefited only 1% of Wisconsin's 3 million workers. & he wants to brag about this. 

Working families get lots of PR & promises. Meanwhile 100% of bank owners split $2.5 billion in benefit in law's 1st quarter.
Yeah and they REALLY needed that to buy another government.
Why are you campaigning when you should be doing actual work for #WeThePeople ? #TrumpFraud #GovernmentWaste #TrumpStooge
Besides groping women, what exactly did Joe Biden do for 8 years?
Here is some light reading to help you get started on that question. 
BTW you can google can't you?
I live in NYC. I don’t know anyone who got a raise or bonus due to your tax cut for huge corporations.  I heard the banks made a couple billion though.
They said NY would not see a tax cut due to your state tax. You better watch who you're voting for next time. Them democrat communist love taking our money to  pay for their foul fish projects. You could always move out of NY. Many are moving fr NY due to high state tax.
Since your horrible #GOPTaxScam
Boy you are on the koolaid. Ryan and Walker HAVE bankrupted this state. And 28k are a drop in the bucket. SERVERS STILL ONLY MAKE $2.33 AN HOUR. WHERE IS OUR RAISE (SINCE 1976) #LYINGRYAN #VOTEGOPOUT #TREASONTRUMP #BLUEWAVE #RESIST


The President" #REPUBLICANS & #Trump lies lies lies and lies and here is the the RESULTS #AMERICA : NEWS ALERT:    #WakeUpAmerica  LET THIS SINK IN!! #America
No matter how many times you repeat that lie we all know it's a tax scam benefits only the wealthy you may have convinced some but not most of us.
You do realize that 28K is only  .007 percent of Adults in WI.  Your tax cut didn't help the unemployed, Union members with contracts, or seniors or all the companies who didn't make ANY changes due to the tax change.  @GOP
History will show republicans better way was nothing more then a fleecing of the nation but building a bigger swamp with bigger swamp dwellers
Resign hypocrite
Now, if y'all can do something about the gas prices! Goes up daily & will be maxed out for Memorial Day weekend. 
Greedy people when the barrel prices are low & stock market high.
Pure greed--- take them down
Do something about gas prices, every time a Republican is in office gas prices are sky high and they don’t give a damm, because they are vested in oil! Bunch of sorry bastards!
They build their bank accounts off the back of working people!!
So Mike, what about the 13 million that will lose their healthcare insurance, the other's whose premiums will rise, the $1.5 TRILLION added to the deficit from the #CorporateWelfare for Big Business and taxcuts for the 1%....what about that?
Over 80% of tax cut benefits those making $1,000,000 or more!

Yes, yes you do!
Keep repeating and some people may believe.  Don't forget to mention the $4 Billion that big banks profited last QUARTER by the tax cuts.
Later today you’ll also still be in the closet.
SAD!
Raise: permanent ongoing change to salary

Bonus: one time payment, not guaranteed again 

Also - many of these “bonuses” were $1000. After taxes, it comes out to about $62.50 per month.

Tell me gain - HOW MUCH IS THE COMPANY BENEFITTING VS. the employees $62.50?
Hey Mike, tell the folks how you screwed In State employee's with MANDATORY FLEX TIME. NO OVERTIME PAY REQUIRED.
You do realize that 28,000 workers is 0.48% if the population of Wisconsin. Too much kool-aid.
They are busy celebrating their $1.50 /week pay raise. Yeah, @SpeakerRyan already told us. Yay. We’re also really excited that @realDonaldTrump ‘s cabinet is wasting our precious taxes-$40,000 secret phone booths, $30,000 tables, 1st class airfare for private vacations...

The poor do not pay taxes
Tell democrats they need to stop trying to smuggle in their voters with bus and train loads from south America and Mexico
They are not here legally. They can't vote. Where do you get up your information?
He gets it from @realDonaldTrump and/or @FoxNews
And how much did those 28K get? Because a thousand dollars is paltry & patronizing, when your billionaire donors got hundreds of thousands or more! #truth #GOPTaxScam #GOPCorruption #resist

@VP  What say You? #FakeChristian Go Yourself
Can you spend equal time explaining the use of most of the 1+ trillion $$ you gave to big GOP donors, big corp stock buybacks & corrupt US Senate vote buying schemes?
Still lying? Jesus.... 

Any comment on the waffle House thing?
$1.50/hr??? while WS took 93 Billion??
Unfortunately, my Leftist company with 1.56 billion USD revenue for 2017, has done NOTHING for its employees.  They're afraid it will reflect positively on Republicans for the mid-term elections, is my guess.  I am very grateful for the extra $100 I get to keep in my paycheck.
Go work for someone else then. It sounds like you are unhappy and your morals apparently do not align with those of your employer. I’m sure there are others who would gladly take your place.
Hey Michelle, do your morals line up with your employer? You must be an automaton.
She's probably a leech.
Yeah, that’s me alright. Work two jobs, always the breadwinner... I don’t complain about my life, I work it. Maybe you should try that approach. A leach is a person who stays at a job they hate and complains about their employer... look in the mirror John.
LOL, you just make up definitions as you go along.  1st, I said leech.  2nd, look up leech. 3rd, you complain all day every day (see page).  4th, I stated why my employer didn't do anything with the tax cuts & why I thought they didn't.  Nothing to do with morals. 5th, Idiot.
Look in the mirror John. It will be painful but do it anyway. Don’t like your employer, quit your job. Pretty fucking simple... enjoy your $200 a month. See ya in 2018 for tax time... you’ll really be crying then.
You poor thing, Michelle. 

.......................

Why is it Left loons have to lie to themselves?  I'll tell you why.  
They must feel good about themselves, but what they do rarely makes them feel good.  So, they lie and live lies, so that they feel good.  Truth be damned.
So the population of WI is approx 5.5 million, and the civilian labor force is approx 3.2 million. 28,000 / 3,200,000 = less than 1%. Way to go!  Super successful!
The American electorate is not stupid. Passification of the masses with a token, miniscule pittance of a tax "cut" will not float. Not even in Wisconsin.
Holler back after we file our 2018 tax returns. How many of these fine workers will pay MORE in taxes because you clowns have increased their taxable income? How many charities will fail?

Trillion-dollar budget deficits will make the next recession more painful https://cnnmon.ie/2Jl0coM  
If Pence were an honest man, he'd talk to Wisconsinites about how his party is coming for their Social Security and Medicare, now that they have created massive deficits.
The impending deficit was Ryan's excuse to go after S.S, Medicare/Medicaid. Hopefully nothing is done before he disappears into a bear cave to be devoured. He sees S.S. as handouts. Doesn't want to think  he existed w/death benefits after his dad died.
And....billionaires have made billions. Trickle down works just like your lawyers...NOT

ONCE A RINO ALWAYS A RINO.
Fucken clowns leading clowns with lies
That’s nothing!  You can brag when the numbers are in the millions!
Sweet but what are you doing to keep them permanent besides NOTHING
Look at the stock market -- look at the T bills -- this is all because of your stupid tax cuts -- it is becoming a disaster and your lies and propaganda will not change our views. Midterms will be hell.
I know your ignorant base can't see the Forest for the trees but the majority can! It's a scam.
Less sure of Ryan's input and utility
I find it strange that you call yourself a Christian.
Most Christians condone adulterous behavior and divorce.
The people who benefited the most from the #TaxScamBill are @SpeakerRyan and his millionaire friends in #Wisconsin. Your #MAGAts are going to figure that out by November @GOP

Oh, dear. I hadn't seen this before. Talk about lowered expectations.
28k... In ALL of Wisconsin... 
So the #GOPTaxScam isn't working.
It's all a matter of perspective.
Maybe while you’re at it you could pop on over to Michigan and drop off some free bottled water to the residents of Flint since Gov Snyder doesn’t think it necessary to provide them with clean water.

Liberals would rather tax higher, then tell us it's ok... we will give you what you think you need.
Hey Mike, if the tax cuts were the big selling point ya’ll hoped they’d be to voters, you and Paul wouldn’t have to try and convince everyone how great they are, just saying.
Effect... debt...
You really should stop talking like we're stupid. You added 1.6 trillion dollars to the deficit. And now you think you're going to come for Social Security. Which is why Ryan is bailing because he doesn't want to be there for the Mayhem
I love your sweet gaze  to illegitimate potus .  It’s sweet .
Go @VP and God bless
Six big banks made 3.5 Billion dollars in the first quarter of 2018 alone.   $3.5 Billion.  But do go on.
Pence is a sorry complicit liar continuing to hurt and embarrass Americans. Ryan, there are no acceptable printable words for what ryan has done to Americans. Can't wait until they are all exiled or in prison. #ImpeachTrump
The number of folks employed in WI in November was just above 3 million. That means that 28k is less than 1%. Whoopee!  #GOPTaxScam

How much were your raises? Those people are suckers. You are the worst kind of liars. #TaxScamBill Eddie Munster is quitting because he knows what's coming. They got measly raises while you all plot to kill benefits they need in the future.  Your base is not that smart. #vote
Wait till that tax plans goes into effect and they all get slaughtered maybe those idiots will wake up then.
The idiots will probably blame @BarackObama. They will get exactly what they should.
3.1m employed in WI & 28k w raise/bonus = LESS THAN 1%       #GOPTaxScam #TrumpTaxScam   so yeah, good for the 28k.  where is the rest of the tax cut going???
Maaaaannnn, I wish I live in the same America as yours ( God bless). In our sanctuary states we got $0 taxes, plus we losing our jobs to illegals. Unemployment overpayments debt is killing us American veterans.
So which job did uou lose to an illegal immigrant? Picking fruit? Cleaning toilets? Doing crap level construction work? You can’t be stupid enough to believe they actually take jobs Amercians would do
It seems you’re one of those who lives in can of sardines, with shrinking brain!! They work in DMV, immigration, IRS, banks. Educate yourself about sanctuary state??!the secretary of the Governor is illegal.wake up?
You Moran, it is a sanctuary states. Do your research about it . But what do we expect from aburritohead.

Borrowed money we all owe.
Deficits as far as the eye can see, huge tax cuts for billionaires and gargantuan stock buybacks for corporations- that is the actual result of your Enrich The Kochs “reform”. When did honesty stop being a Christian virtue?
Inflation, rise in interest rates and rise in gasoline prices will take those bonuses and raises all away! Not to mention the rise in premiums for health insurance!
Wisconsinite here....thank you to all who made this happen! I am already seeing a big difference!! #GodBlessOurPresident #MAGA
Thank you!  Please help make them permanent!
Did Trumpito allow you a seat at the state dinner?
Pushing your anti-LGBTQ agenda on Wisconsin. Wisconsin deserves better.
Wisconsin really does deserve better you sickos should be sent to Canada or somewhere else

He prayed for poor people! He urged others to keep the poor in mind when drafting legislation. That’s what a Jesuit Priest does. This action is not a failing of a priest but the failure of @SpeakerRyan to uphold what every religion teaches, care for the poor.
Monney is welcome.
Y'ALL DON"T GOVERN, you just serve your masters. #KochSuckers As Deficit Soars Toward $1 Trillion, Congress Shrugs and Keeps Spending
Harley Davidson is moving to Taiwan.
But those raises are all spent on rising gasoline prices. One would think Exxon’s 8.3 billion dollar tax savings would trickle down to consumers, but I guess no one in government really cares about reality.
For now just wait a couple of years when their salaries go down
YES ...THAT IS WHAT THE USA NEEDS TO REBOOT OUR COUNTRY.
Yeah 28000 people got a onetime bonus or an insignificant raise that constituted a tiny portion of the windfall those corps got from the phony tax fraud break trump and friends gave the super rich. No go to wisc and have a party. Please stay there

Funny. Only 27% of Americans support the GOP’s bonus for the rich. Your signature legislation is a big flop for most of us. We’ll remember how you sold us out come November.
Hello
28k get bonuses and 20 million loose their health care.  Another million plus loose food stamps and more loose some social security benefits.  Yeah this tax cut certainly seems real winner to me.......NOT!
Hahahahaha that's hysterical! I'm now working two jobs with no protection or stability whatsoever. Also, both places are completely understaffed.
Did anybody get the $4-7,000 annual raise as promised?  Why are 80% of corporate tax savings being spent on stock buy-backs?
Vomitous claptrap.
Some reminders: @SpeakerRyan has jacked us with a massive deficit the GOP is fighting to pay for by cutting your mom's #medicare and #socialsecurity & your kid's #medicaid. Any cuts to your personal taxes expire in a few years. #WI

What a bunch of BS.  Your taxscam is a disgrace.
Too busy reading about big banks saving 3 1/2 BILLION DOLLARS to bother with the GOP’s pennies for paupers news.  Why not tweet about that?  Don’t you think it would play well with the little people?

A tiny fraction of the millions of workers in WI have seen any benefits. Sickening.
Most of us didn't get that.  My 401k is getting killed.  Gas prices up at least 20 cents in 2 weeks #fuck45
But not for seniors
Gay man
You should also resign. The law will also be going after you. You are just as much of a traitor as trump. The truth will come to the light.
And goes on to say, "forget about gas prices going sky high again after Kushner got his money from a mystery source, and appx 400 a year of that break will go to pay more for gas just to get to work; forget about city, county, state taxes going up to offset what we gave the rich
Wisconsin is returning to blue...hopefully more resembling our Victor Berger past
I’m still waiting for my dollar fifty, not going to hold my breath. Meanwhile, my grandkids will be paying for the trillions the tax scam will add to the national debt.
#GOPTaxScam doesn't help low and middle class earners. But your buddies the #KochBrothers love it! Ain't that right @SpeakerRyan $500,000.00

Jesus doesn’t like liars Mike, how do you reconcile that?

The increase in the price of gas will wipe out any increase that any low to mid income workers saw. And rising healthcare costs and food and shelter. Thanks Mike you've screwed us all.
Only makes up for the furloughs and 20% pay cuts from a few years ago.  I know whereof I speak, as I have a sibling who is a prof at U of WI and his frustrations with having to feed his family and get the same amount of work done on 20% less.   Trump is a complete idiot.
What about the nearly 3,000,000 Wisconsin workers who will only see their taxes go up? The GOP sold us out.

The collective yawn of the media to the revelation that Trump may have faked his medical records especially after he made Clinton's health an issue is the latest reminder that he gets to play by different rules than any other politician.
Ur mortgaged the future of our children....! For nothing! We only pray for Trump’s health because you are worse!

Unfortunately Chaplin Conroy. The 2017 GOP Tax Plan definitely had a very small group of winners and lots of losers. House Chaplain Who Prayed About GOP Tax Bill Fired By Paul Ryan
Wow one company
1.9 trillion more in debt by 2020.Not concervative at all.
Speaker Ryan forces out the House chaplain, angers lawmakers
Oh, all $12.00 of it? - now they can buy a frozen pizza.
@PRyan  You both have no backbone. Treasonous non-American traitors!

Tax cuts from US incurring large debt that will come due and payable after 2018 election and with rising gas prices will barely cover the increased cost of filling up their tanks.

You mean tax reform, not a tax cut.  This is a joke!!
Never seen such hateful replies from people who seem to simply appear envious of those who have made different life-choices which lead to greater success.
You are such a con artist.  Tax reform is a scam.

Do any of you jerks @POTUS, @VP, or @SpeakerRyan tell the people in WI that the bonus is a one time thing and that they won’t ever see it again and that your raise though it adds money to your check it’s also taking away money as well!

You’re in the minority here Mike!

Just read the story. This a beautiful thing for Wisconsin. For the farming industry in the American people.

Nice job good news
Such a sham!

More than half of registered voters say they haven’t noticed an increase in their paychecks as a result of the new tax law https://politi.co/2HsENgP  
The workers who did get bonuses (most didn’t), got a tiny fraction of their yearly pay. Meanwhile billionaires and giant corporations are laughing all the way to the bank. You’re a horrible person who is going to hell.
