I live in NC and I can tell you that NONE of what you are claiming is true. Things are a mess in this state from taxes to pollution. Come on down for some GenX water!
Not to mention our failing schools, cuts to safety net programs, failure to protect DACA....I could go on and on. Republicans are failing NC in DC and here at home. The #TaxScam you passed will be paid for by the poor and middle class. #VoteThemOut
How about Tennessee, Sir?
You can have pence. He is why we’re going to jail the donald slowly
Thanks for all you both do & staff  From a North Carolinian! 

The tax cuts are working in every State.
Why don't you address and help SC too?
You are completely wrong. It’s a tax cut for the rich and the corporations & banks.
I have a small business and I don't see none of the money.

Tax cuts benefit the richest in North Carolina - and elsewhere else in America. Thanks dude
Poor people dont pay taxes, so how can you cut what they don't pay?
Great job bro.

If this for Hillary the nose would be all the way to China:-))

Keep up the great work!!! 
What great work would that be?

After the GOP tax cuts, corporations have spent **37 times** more on stock buybacks than worker bonuses or raises.

Because of the sacrifices by N. Carolina’s homeless, sick and poor, TAX CUTS are working for Donald Trump and his family. To maintain his wealth @POTUS wants N. Carolina to keep delivering. 

Read my op-ed in @theobserver
Get off your knees please. It is unseemly for the @VP to be a butt kisser. You are being an enabler to Treason. Our Democracy is at risk and your political career is over. You will never be president. You are  @VP to a Moron-in-Chief. Not a good reference for a presidential run.
1. The old system isn’t complicated
2. Few of us do our taxes on “a sheet of paper,” we call it e-filing, it’s been around for years
3. NC has lost & stands to lose a bundle more $$ b/c of HB2
4. There are 10.27 MILLION citizens of NC, 50K is a tiny drop in the bucket
@vp @SecondLady Good Morning! Prayers you, your @WhiteHouse team, @SecretService and @USMC/@usairforce crew have a safe and successful trip and visit to the "Great State" of @VisitNC Have a nice day...God Bless! 
 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
What is this trip costing the country and how does the country benefit from the money spent?
North Carolina won't support Tillis anymore. We do however want the pastor back. To bad Tillis won't stand with our President like he does in his support for a bogus investigation.
As a lifelong Republican, it’s a mystery how the extreme, intolerant branch of my party merged with the Trumpers to form this awful hybrid of the GOP.  They listen to talk radio and Fox ,don’t read and hate Hillary and Obama with an insane passion.  All dog whistles for hate.
Thank you President Trump and Vice president Mike Pence
Tillis is a RINO>
Socialism does not work.   I ask any democrat please show me one country it’s worked in.  My family is from Venezuela.  It has destroyed my country.
God bless...
Bullshit, tax scam is working
Lier
We the public are so tired of you that are so negative, so down on everything that the Trump Administration does, that you all should just stop talking because We that truly sees what he's done for this country, are not listening. Last Administrat gave nothing olny took.
Amen Ms.Joyce Amen!!! 

Suggesting we make Jesus our source?  OK...I’d agree with that.  
Mike, what about trump breaking the 7th Commandment multiple times? Does that not apply to him? I’m confused.  #Adultery
It didn't mean anything to both Clinton's when Billy boy did it in the oval office. How soon we forget lol
I don’t believe the hypocrisy was as extreme then. You go your way, I’ll go mine.
You VP , you make me laugh to death.
Which North Carolinians? Not the middle class ones.

Lies and deciet, just as bad as his boss!
Liar. Can't spell
If those families are the 1%, this tax cut works great.  Otherwise you've saddled the 99% with >$1,5 trillion in debt to primarily benefit the 1%.  Tax cut will not be ROI positive to the economy.  What a waste!
1.5 over 8 yrs but u were ok with obama increasing it 8 trillion in 8 yrs....yea we will listen to your hate.
They are all good with running it up to give tax breaks to corps during healthy economy. Want to steal our ss & medicare total bs
I agree stealing Social Security and Medicare is bullshit but don't try to lay it at the Republicans feet alone
Seeing as how dems oppose this and gop is for it & #donnieshithole is for it OF COURSE THIS IS ALL ON GOP geez how blind can you be
I am talking about the deficit not all being on the Republicans and I have no problem with the tax breaks as I am not the 1% but I'm still making how about $40 more a week
Sure Dems share blame, but much of the 8T you blame on Obama is R in origin (same things in my chart, deficits drive debt). So if I offer you $40/WK for 10 yrs so I can get $4000/WK forever & you pay for my windfall over generations + kick 13MM off healthcare you're good with it?
So glad we're out of that 8 year race baiting, unemployment, welfare oppression!
Yay !
The best the best we have ever had. Thank you thanks to our mighty God bless you all
Thanks for all the hard work
After 8 years the billion dollar companies tax cuts become permanent, and the rest of us Americans our tax cuts expire, and we are going to have to start paying back the 1.3 trillion debt that this tax cut has burdened us with by paying higher taxes. This tax cut helps Trump/rich
@SenatorBurr @RepDavidEPrice The POTUS is a mentally ill criminal. Stand up to stop him from firing Rosenstein and inviting Putin to the WH on his way to a GOP-enabled dictatorship.
Tax cuts certainly ARE working for Wall Street banks. To the tune of $3.6 Billion! You people are crooks. Shame on you! See you at the polls.
Brainwashed and apparently dropped in Clorox as a baby.


The banks are loving it. Gave some change to the rest of us.
The Vice President didn't say that he would pray for North Carolina. 
You’ll never be the President. Stop pandering and get a real job.
Lying is a sin. Its one of the commandments
Awesome thank you .
You are awesome...praying

One state of 50. Woo hoo. 
My husband just got a bonus love it just 2 weeks ago.Thank you. . Not a crumb (  a thousand dollars )  but I am grateful for what we were given. Loving more money in my paycheck as well.
@SenThomTillis @POTUS @theobserver 
Really @SenThomTillis?
Does Trump make you kiss his ass ?
Lies

Just more lies from stooge Pence and the lying, corrupt President.  It’s so bad that Pence has to write his own propaganda.  Real journalists won’t spread the lies.  So, we are now left with Pence and Fox & Frauds, to sources with absolutely no credibility.

No they are not working for poor people or for most middle class. Moreover, this tax cut puts our country deeper in debt to facilitate more money for rich people.
MAGA Mr. Vice President!!
President Pence speaks to Americans while so called President Trump, squawks to Americans. #2 -your stock is rising!!#realDonaldTrump


@Beth0214Skal @POTUS @theobserver just worked there last year. My state taxes were 50% of federal.
Mike, How about the rest of us in the United States.  American People, not just one state.
Well, show those numbers then
Thank you Vice-President Pence 

Don’t be stupid
You're the TOTUS - Toady of the United States.  Pathetic.
Did you see all the empty seats? LMAO
live in NC and have seen many benefits already.
I paid more this year than last year on less income because of your lies.
Fake news
Trump puppet@his best

Can't wait to celebrate with you in Las Vegas! We're getting things done!

Do not know anyone who benefitted from the tax cuts.
You’re as much a joke as you’re me boss
I thought I felt the presence of Satan close to me today. You were 50 miles away. Makes sense.
How are tax cuts + large U.S. debt supposed to work-out? Negative + Negative = HUGE NEGATIVE... right?
But if the tax cut is working for ordinary people, why are so many standing in line for free  dental care??? You are NOT taking care of the people in your nation.
Thank you for your visit to Greensboro
What a liar you take after Trump all these tax cuts are doing is making the rich richer
The letter sendet to the oportunist and best farc friend president Farc Santoshttps://www.eluniverso.com/opinion/2018/04/19/nota/6721014/presidente-santos

Leaving the poor poorer
Pence you’re a tool
Just don't look or be close to any of those women. We know how you are
I'm here waiting to see you!
I'm still waiting for you and #OneTermThom to deliver *anything* that improves the situation for those of us in #northcarolina.
They may be working but at what cost?  Over $1 Trillion added to national debt.  That’s a national security risk.
Not my family
. @VP @POTUS @theobserver Liar. The tax cuts aren't working and will cause a huge recession/depression as the deficit rises. Giving more money to the rich doesn't help the economy.
BS. Tax cuts were a reward for big donors, add trillions to debt, corps are buying back stock instead of investing, middle class cuts are minimal, passing debt problem to future generations.
#dishonest #irresponsible #corrupt #TrumpGOP
You're so full of crap it's leaking out of your mouth. So many lies.
To be fair, we still need some help in a lot of places.  Hopefully it won't be much longer of a wait.
Your son Hunter isn’t playing well for the Giants. You need to take him to batting practice
This tweet is a lie.

Your strong support of  our POTUS, has been his strength.

It's a good thing that President Obama left the U.S Economy in such good shape for P45 so he could just take credit for it.
Lying hypetcrit
Crock of lies.
Toady, saying it don’t make it so.
Yay
This is fake news.
I call BS...more like the GOP Tax Scam that only benefits the rich and corporations at the expense of the Middle Class!!!
Liar!!!!!
Thank You
FU traitor
More GOP Lies! 
The GOP promised $4k - $9k for the average American Family. The truth has come out ... the average American Family is getting $323.00,
but Warren Buffett is getting $22Billion!
Have you counted up the # of jobs lost that came w/the bonuses or plant closures?
Um, perhaps you could find the time to do something useful and, instead of fundraising for @RepMarkWalker at GSO Country Club, offer actual support to the community living with the aftermath of the tornado? Just a thought.
Yay!

Wow Mike!! If you think this is great for NC, you’ve been around Trump way too long
What leadership?  Keeps changing his mind on policy issues. All he does is watch television, tweet and golf! How presidential!
Are you kidding? It's been a failure!!! Except for the rich   and know that! Stop lying your children and grandchildren will read about you in their Gov and history classes!!! Shame on you!!!
Seems like the Veep needs to do a little brown nosing with boss man before this weekend’s inevitable tweet tantrum.
Your' Prayers and Encouragement to President Trump and others are a continuous need. Thank You
Oh, yuck Poor NC
Lie Pence, you all have indebted America to the future. Selfish!
Why do you keep writing op ed's that the majority of the people do not read. The leadership of POTUS and the Republican Party are destroying our country the tax crap bill that was passed will come back to haunt everyone except the rich
my dude, you're bragging that 50k workers have benefited from the tax bill in a state with 4.7 million workers. 

Your big message as you come to NC is that 1% of workers have seen benefits?
Well to be fair in some states it is as much as 4% of workers have seen a benefit....
Lying is a sin, you know. Lucky you're just s pseudo Christian. But you'll still be going straight to hell
HYPOCRITE
Thanks @NC_GovernorCooper! As for you, VP Pence...please l stay away or you'll be hit by the #BlueTsunami made up of millions of NC #Snowflakes 

More delusional drivel about the trump tax scam.
So sad you’ve sold your soul and are working for trump. You’ve become a pseudo-Christian. What happened to your moral compass? #MostUnstableAndCorruptPresidencyEver

Just drove thru NC. They voted on a promise u can’t deliver

Tax cuts are working for the rich only!
And the DEFICIT????
Prices are already rising. Wiping out any tax cut


How is the #GOPTaxScam compensating for rising costs?  NC families are in the hole due to rising gas prices while corps and wealthy are swimming in $.

So much for the rest of the country!
HAHAHAHAHAHA, Ya Hedge Fund Workers.
No. They’re only working for the top 5% of North Carolinians.
VP Pence is once again pimping the tax scam.
What North Carolina are those tax cuts working for again?
if you like our republicans so much, take the @NCLeg with you on the way out.
Hey man are you going to take the chair or what bro.
This money grab disguised as a tax cut is designed to further widen the income gap. Trump and Pence are cutting the education budget. Why? Because an uneducated electorate works in their favor.
Who's paying for the republican $$$$trillion debt?
Shut up Pence.
