A place based on science and fact.  What in the hell are you doing there?
All the VPs tour JPL



God Bless you Vice President Pence and President Trump! May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Bless your Soul's for all of Eternity!
Proud of this Adminstration!
God doesn't bless racists
That also includes you!
Not racist, try again
What part of their policy showed them as racist?
I think the topic that was covered was Truchas and Mexican Mafia which in my neighborhood is very real. I don't think much has been done about it though. The same people I just mentioned still live close by. NBA dude though, I have no idea.
A blessing for you and your family.
The Lord is on our side Mr President. 
I am so proud that you are our president. Thank you! It's a great time to be ALIVE
I listen to this song every day since I discovered it. I'd like to dedicate it…

Amazing how far we’ve come in 6,000 years huh, Mike?
NASA believes climate change is real. Do you?
More like, knows
Don't pretend that you're pro-NASA when you tear down science and put a climate change denier in charge of it.

Mike Pence I love you so much!  #MAGA

She is Miley, she was rescued today from a garbage dump, she barely has the strength to eat because of all the illnesses she suffers, she feels fear to humans, but thanks to God everything went well and I trust in us. …
I don't know if they mentioned it to you, Mr. Vice President, but they have definitive proof there at NASA that the Earth is round and is more than 6018 years old. Don't let it throw you for a loop.
Gee and why is that?  6000 years is about right biblically....you fool!

Does mother approve?

You think the earth is like 6000 years old lol
Time is a concept created by man.Throughout history man has changed the scale of time.Years in accordance with the bible and people of ancient times are way different than http://today.You  think you know time:-0
But the Bible is complete horse shit.

Hey did you cut funds and end the lunar lander project if you support NASA so much?


Is that what you do?? Since you suggested this about others makes people think that’s what you only think about!! Stupid much??? Your post speaks do you!!#Trump#MAGA
Please get your boss to resign!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No way!  He is a Great boss!
#MuellerIsComing
#Qanon Yes he is!
This stinks. No one should have to wait for prosecutor to begin the political remedy for a guy who is openly accepting bribes, has conspired with a foreign adversary re our election and is an organized crime boss. The Articles of Impeachment write themselves.
You're in the dark.
Boom
Beautiful clear blue skies 3 days straight! No #chemtrails! Does this mean we are winning the #SpaceWars? #MAGA #Qanon #FlatEarth #SpaceForce #QuestionEverything #KAG #GreatAwakening #NASAlies #firmament #Trump2020
JPL is awesome! I've been there. Have a fantastic time! 
But you don’t believe in science?
I've worked at @NASAJPL teaching astronomy and science to people from all around the world. It still baffles me @VP and @POTUS that you are either dumb to the facts of science/climate or you are being heavily influenced and bought out by the oil industry. Everyone else gets it!
You can't say we are "leading", not untill we can shuttle our own astronauts to the ISS at very least.
You need to shut up
I sure don't.


Did you meet any nice air men?
We cannot lead in space until we have our own manned space program flights. Get #Orion and #SLS flying.
why? Just why? @NASAJPL @POTUS
Bummer you can’t go to the #WHCD because you’re thin orange skinned snowflake of a boss is too busy “campaigning” for an election over 2 1/2 years away  you might want to let him know he actually has to work the next 2 years (or at least until impeachment) 
come visit us at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland @vp, @SecondLady and @charlipence.  Bring @realMarlonBundo too!
Thank you Mr. Pence

That’s all it’s between  his ears  is space !!!
MR VICE PRESIDENT I THINK BEFORE EXPLORING MARS ;WE.SHOULD FIX OUR PROBLEM HERE AT HOME!
Good

How ironic -- no guns at NRA convention? Why, you'd almost think guns were dangerous  Lying hypocritical @GOP @NRA @realDonaldTrump

And meanwhile... ICE held an American citizen for MONTHS... And Trump is holding NAZI rallies for his white supremacist followers.
Errrmmm, don’t you mean under @elonmusk and @SpaceX?
Delusional. We are not leading in space exploration. Sigh.
Awesome job Vice President.  God bless you and your family.
God help us with the two of you in charge.
I may just unfollow you for that RT...
Sputnik. A Russian satellite was in orbit in 1957. NASA didn't even fully exist until October of 1958. Explorer 1 was the USA's first satellite in 1958 as well. Not yelling. Just gently correcting.
Under Trump America is being destroyed. The Trump/Pence administration is the single biggest threat the world faces today! Trump must be stopped.

While you are here, get yourself an In-N-Out Burger.
This is too easy. Next time Pence. Next time. #mulligan

#Electromagneticgravitics please #electromagneticgravitics
I think that's what's called 'walking a fine line' Whatever the reason, it's nice to see things move forward i.e. you really make use of the money!!! U really know 'which side your bread is buttered' !!! Just smile nicely and take the money and run...

Trump effect
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING!
A real rocket scientist. LOL
Wait, What? America is leading in space? The rocket trucks we send to the space station are provided by a private company, and US astronauts hitch rides on Russian spacecraft. We haven't been to the moon in 46 years, longer than most Americans have been alive. Leading? Bullshit.
If left to his own thinking The Indiana Stooge would have you believe the earth revolves around Trump.

Remove Trump & Stooge, vote complict GOP science deniers out, and get a qualified NASA administrator.
And you are supposed to be Vice President not Trumps minion.

@VP @POTUS  hey Trick, Morals is what you should be researching for your come back gimmick 
This teaches you NOTHING 
NASA been at this for years you just happen to be in the Chair
By the way sleeping well..  
 Tea and milk won't help the FALL Down Hill Lovee

Thank goodness!  A more enthusiastic look at the future of space.
Big whoop!  Can’t live in outer space but if any of you Repubs would like to go - have at it.
Just fly away
But it’s Science!!!
Take a jet out of the USA. #NOW
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE

As if Trump designed it all. What BS.
GOD.
Really? How sad.
Glory to God!!!  Leading in SPACE!!!   We shout, hallelujah!

Please step down, and take drumpfer with you!
Do you ever work in DC, or is your job a permanent,  directionless road show?  Asking for a friend.
Golden Boy your boring

Let’s get back to the Moon.
Let’s get back to Earth climate change observation, which is what NASA was doing before Trump sent it on a forced “vacation” to Mars.
Let’s get you a ship and blast you off.

US Vice President Mike Pence  @VP
The real genius tRump wants to defund the space station and go back to the moon! BRILLIANT!! Now if only we could get HIM to go and stay there!
omg mr pence 
you are a true american hero
thanks for your dilligent work ethic and ideals
Have to take mother along cause she knows when you start thinking about men alone in a space station for months you end up back in conversion therapy.
Caption: " You see that Rover mr Vice President?  Hopefully it finds a place for us to live in space before you republicans fuck up our entire planet by refusing to do jack or shit about finding alternative energy sources to oil/gas"
Vice President Mike Pence.....consider Loren Dale Hunt for vice president if you become president
Can you, for once in your life, stop being a sheep and start being a factual leader?  @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with @NASA and it’s plans and you are politicizing a great federal agency #morontrump #fool #pence @VP #stoplying
You don’t even understand what that means....meanwhile, ESA has a space station and a cooperative one at that where work together.
love you and yours, vice president Pence
Thank you for your hard work VP Pence. Keep America great! Stay strong!
@SecondLady God bless!  #NASA 
Yay!
Quit this again bull shit. USA was leading by a mile before you ever left Indiana.
Again?
Thank you VP Pence! And thank your wife for all of the great work she is doing with art therapy. I can’t wait to see my son on the moon for just a joyride!!
Prez Pencey sounds good

Wow, that’s great! Who was first in space before Trump took over? What new initiatives did he start/complete to move us back into first place and what can we expect in the future? Thanks!
Pence thinks his grandfather hunter dinosaurs. Probably not the best person to listen to when it comes to anything involving science. And congrats to Nasa despite trump’s incompetence.
Wondering if this will be the future for criminals ...

@realDonaldTrump all about saving tax dollars. 
Could space be the new GITMO ? Huuuum 
I for one  think it’s a fantastic idea. One way trip to outer space.  
Just for kicks and giggles,
Who should be one 1st trip?

STFU dill weed.
In my old home town!  Thanks for coming, Mr. Vice President!
Awesome! Thanks for all you do@VP! Here in Indiana we know you have taken a lot of flak for standing up for conservative values! God bless you, your lovely wife and family!
What ur god say about flighing into space Michael?
Brah do you even believe in space.

Re: #FatherConroy's unjust firing: advocating for the poor and marginalized is what every priest, every minister, in fact every Christian, is called to do. If you have a problem with that, you have a problem with Jesus.
@NASAJPL is an awesome place!

You mean we are leading even after your administration has cut budgets?    I think you mean we at “still@leading, despite budget cuts, thanks to billionaires with dreams.”
Please do not be fooled by North Korea!  We have repeatedly experimented and developed to discard them. The real crisis is imminent. Please do not negotiate easily, do not agree!

@WhiteHouse @NASA @Scavino45 @TeamTrump @BoeingDefense Our beloved @realDonaldTrump Bold NEW policy of #PeaceThroughPOWER has shortened space with the newly GREENLIT magnetized #ParticleRailBeam solar project enabling connecting travel between Earth, Moon & Space, @CassiniSaturn
My cousin works there!


Hahahahahahaha, you really are completely delusional Mikey.
Did you stick you greasy fool hand on the rocket again Pence? Listen up Pence, you, and Putin puppet con-man TRUMP'S SCHTICK IS UP, over, kaput, finished. RESIGN NOW for the good of the country, for Democracy, for our Children and our World...and for the sake of "God"... RESIGN !
Impose your prejudice and antipathy to science here too. You are a horrible embarrassment to every American and Jesus wishes you’d resign.
You love NASA so much do is a favor and go you won't be missed
Under most presidents, the US leads in space, you bs artist.
What is @VP doing there?  They deal with #science, something #MikePence is against.
Wonder how many JPL scientist think human caused climate change is a hoax? Answer===>0.0
Leading in space but not at home.  Sad!
Not inspiring for them... friends at NASA so embarrassed by Trump nightmare appointee... they are both despirited and enraged by Trump amateur hour. Can't wait for perp walk...Trump ruins everything he touches...King Midass ... Everything he touches turns to shit.
You fool, our planet is going to shit because you and the orange moron don't believe in climate change but you want to waste money on space exploration? For what? Spend those billions on our Vets, families, healthcare!
You should write for AAA



Space exceeds our time & makes us bow in aww the Miracle! eternal secrets of the Almighty!
Why don’t you help out the distressed American citizens instead of bragging about your stupid visit to a Jet Propulsion Lab?
Too bad the leader for #NASA APPOINTED by @realDonaldTrump isn’t even a scientist #TrumpSwamp #VoteBlue2018 
Wrong!!! Trump defunded NASA!!!
STFU, Mikey

Welcome to California!! Sorry for the disrupters!! So many of us love our POUSA and VPOUSA
Who's Dis? Is this VP "Traitor Jr." Pence? Why u so quiet these days? Getting hot around the WH?

Trump is known as currish flap-mouthed clotpole


https://www.britannica.com/event/Nurnberg-Rally …  Today, Trump imitated his hero. Shame on the Republican party.
Space force! Do you have any idea how insane that sounds?
As the daughter of a test engineer from the Minuteman through the Space Shuttle, just what is the sudden change in our space exploration since Trump entered the arena?
The 2nd Bush administration did not want to spend the money to re-certify the system (given reason #1), so they directed NASA management to make only critical safety fixes, shut down the logistic chain, and fly the shuttle only long enough to complete the Intern Space Station.

Facts please: Arpaio was convicted of contempt--as in, contempt for the law--and pardoned by Trump. https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/991448021169852417 …
You must be blind. How can you stomach serving a man who is so obscessed with himself that he has put our country in jeopardy just so he can boost his ego?
Careful, looks like you might be endorsing science.  You know the guys that believe in evolution, climate change, vaccines, and a round earth.

Since there is nothing new in improving on propeller systems,which can propulse cargo ans people throughout space at least  300.000 miles per hour,it seems boring to hear that it is impossible to invent.
