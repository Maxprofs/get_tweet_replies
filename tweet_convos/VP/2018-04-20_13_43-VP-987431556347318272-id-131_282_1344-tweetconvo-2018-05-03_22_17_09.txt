Who profits? Specifically, who?
Cintra.  A private company from Spain.  They develop shell companies.  I77 Mobility Partners is shell company in NC.
ALEC??? Is that the group that writes legislative bills and passes them off to state legislators or Congressmen who introduce them w/o change?
Yes.  Our senator won Alec legislator of the year the poof! We have P3
Jeezuz Lordy me
With what money?  As important as infrastructure is, you should have thought of that before you gave such a tax break to the corporations and the top 1%. Don't expect the states to pay for this. They don't have the money either.
Maybe you're too young, or maybe you weren't paying attention, but when Regan cut taxes, the revenue to the federal government DOUBLED! The key is increasing business activities and thereby increasing jobs and thereby increasing the number of tax payers. Check out the numbers.
I meant to say REAGAN.
I am so proud of REBUILDING AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE!!!
Thank You Mike!!!
You are THE VERY NEXT!!!

More slime added to Trump’s swamp in the form of EPA head, Scott Pruitt:

Many more things going on not all US citizens keep their head in the sand and believe everything they read. I do the research.
Ford is moving to China have you seen the news? Walmart laid-off workers the same week they gave some pay raises. GE plant closes in Northeast move to Mexico after getting their 250 million dollar tax break. It's not about the brakes it's about the loopholes pay your fair share.
It would be great to have update on America's plans in competitive arenas (e.g., light speed rail, reported success in Europe), & plans to assure investments in science & technology (STEM) in government. Julie Ann Racino, ASPA Denver Mtg on Science & Technology in Government 2018

Chlorpyrifos hurts the brain and lowers IQ, especially in kids, who also experience tremors due to the chemical. It's been linked to everything from cancer to Parkinson's. A study found the chemical in 87% of umbilical cord blood. Trump reversed its ban. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/28/opinion/sunday/chlorpyrifos-dow-environmental-protection-agency.html …

But to do it the way you are going, invites graft and corruption. Oh yes its the GOP.
Lordstown layoffs, Elder Beerman and Toys T us closing. Yeah FU
Fix @lirr please!!!!!!! Come to NY!
PENCE DON'T GET INVOLVED IN INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE TRUMP IS GOING TO PRISON TOGETHER WITH MICHAEL COHEN.
Exactly How much have you budgeted for infrastructure ?
@RepMarkMeadows @SenThomTillis ?
This is so pathetic
Get it done; we are wasting valuable building time while you vacillate: infrastructure must be taken care of....
Respect the President and Vice President. If Honorable Hilary won I would respect her too.
It’s OK to come out of the closet, Mike. Mother will understand.
Burr, Meadows, and the rest of the pro-treason gang are getting voted out. NC was more progressive years ago before the gerrymandering
Did you discuss your homophobia
Try to save the taxpayers money by selling the empty federal building to local developers to build for local business. http://www.realchangenews.org/2017/05/10/federal-reserve-bank-san-francisco-sold-developer …
Look at all those old white guys! How’d that Asian women get in there?

#GunContolNow
Rebuilding by cutting taxes? How does that work?
Look at all those fat cat white business types. Guess how this is going to go.
So no matter how successful you become you can not escape Power Point!!!
Trump took office with a 45.5% approval rating and 42.3% disapproval rating, per @FiveThirtyEight.

Today, he has a 40.3% approval rating and 54.3% disapproval rating.

He’s lying in a tweet criticizing the media... for lying.

Burr needs to get his head out of his rear end.

Your boss has been a prolific money launderer for stolen Russian money. What would Jesus say about that?
1/ Sedition Timeline - This thread chronologically reviews Trump and his campaign’s crimes against the United States.
You do not represent me, in any way, with your conservative old white man anti LGBT values and your midwestern Republican BS. Try reading some Howard Zinn.
I can’t wait to see the Man Child, this corrupt administration and your fake bible thumping ass go to work.

Your boss and his administration's personal conduct have made the US a joke to the rest of the world.

What does that have to do with rebuilding America's infrastructure?
