Avez-vous électro-choqué vos organes génitaux aujourd'hui?
All of Europe is under the control of the United Nations, who are under the control of the Elitists that want to destroy Sovereignty exchange it for One World Order under Muslim Control! They are all together evil, please wake up!
Watch out @EmmanuelMacron, turns out Pence is taking lying lessons from @realDonaldTrump
sorry Sponge Bob is on.
Ok Mikie, get back where you belong and give Trumps ass a resting place.
Macron's a handsome man.  Don't let Mother catch you popping a boner.
Mr. Vice President. Thank you for your Godly leadership. Baby Elfie Evans needs urgent help.Britain took him off life support and refuse his parents any rights to save his life. Italy gave him citizenship,  but the British gov refused to let him be saved..help him sir ! Vital!
Pence! Didn’t your religious background teach you that it is RUDE to whisper in a Blotus’ ear during world wide television coverage? That’s pretty basic stupidity on your part! Lots of good judgement shown right there...(lol)
Ahhh...Stinky Cheese, The Indiana Stooge, and President Macron of France.

The least curious VP in modern history, hasn’t apparently met with Mueller to talk about managing indicted Foreign Agents Manafort & Flynn.

Remove Stinky Cheese & Stooge and vote complicit GOP Out.

Try not to brush the dandruff off the guys lapel! If you can control the impulse. The other thing, he might kiss you on either cheek, it’s ok to be a little gay.
If you're in #AZ08 please  vote Democrat. We can do this! Together we can make America great again!
Kiss kiss, Morher won’t like that.
Macron? Didn’t that dicknose managed to convince Trump to stay in Syria?
You have no honor
Whisper something to that orange thing about class and etiquette and not to pick lint off of the French President's shoulder. Try to keep him from embarrassing us more. Maybe sit Mother next to him.
Kissing where you always do Pence?

Wrong on all three counts.

Don't let rank partisanship blind you to reality. Far too many people do that these days - both conservatives and liberals. Don't listen to Trump's blatherings and accept them as fact - actions speak louder than words. (Example: no wall will be built.)
