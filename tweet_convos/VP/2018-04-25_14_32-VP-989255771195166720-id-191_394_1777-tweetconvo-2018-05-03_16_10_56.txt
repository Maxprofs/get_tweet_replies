#TaxScam

An analysis by The AP shows the nation's six big Wall Street banks saved at least $3,590,000,000 in taxes last quarter, thanks to the recently enacted Trump tax law. https://apnews.com/96589643061e4437bd45fdcc35959fe0 …

You're doing a great job.


That dog still won't hunt . GOP TaxScam is for corporations and the wealthy . It is bankrupting the country .
Stop the lies!! Just stop!! Your tax cuts make a difference for the wealthy ONLY, not the rest of us. Sit down and stay quiet !
Helped me gain about 100 bucks a month. I’m happy! #TrumpTrain
Crumbs.
Please step down.
Awesome job Vice President Pence

Forget it, Mike. We all know the #GOPTaxScam did nothing for Americans making under $100K a year.

IDIOT DOUCHEBAG!
Middle Class Worker here. 
Eat shit.
#GOPTaxScam



So you are lying.

Have fun!

#GOPTaxScam
I am glad that you and your wealthy buddies are enjoying the tax cuts at the expense of the elderly and the poor.
Liar!

Just fucking quit Mike. This is all losing  battle for this administration.
Certainly making a difference in the lives of #GM & #Carrier workers as they face layoffs. #ThanksDonnyDBag END #TheDonCon NOW!
Oh what tangled lies you weave.
Lies

With musical scoring in the background playing "Telling Me Lies" by the Trio. "Don't put your life in the arms of a man who's no stranger to treason" #BlueTsunami2018
Got news for you....it is all a bunch of lies and you know it
Your tax cuts wii F the country up long term you evil lying POS
Yeah, Mikey, just ask those folks from Kimberly-Clark corporation who are losing, or have already, lost their jobs while the company bought back stocks and moved production to Brazil! Oh, don't forget Ford moving production to Mexico. That'll be great for WI, too!  You moron!!

Kanye West has broken free from the mental prison of the left. Liberals hate diversity of thought... They are enraged when a black man in America voices opinions that are contrary to the liberal narrative. Keep fighting #Kanye. Don’t let the left control you. #MAGA

Ted Cruze wants to make them permanent for middle class. Ask your senator to help him.
My condolences to Milwaukee
Sounds like a propaganda campaign straight out of Goebbeels tell a lie often enough...
So far, corps. and top investors benifit big, the rest not much.

How many people could have health care for $3.59 billion? Child care? A college education? Housing? Food? https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/987325029393293313 …

The Indiana Stooge, and Least Curious VP in modern history, promotes a tax scam that gives corporations 99% of Tax Cuts and maybe gives workers 1%

Stooge is a Corporate Welfarist.

Remove Trump & Stooge and vote complicit GOP out.
Liar
In other telling lies.
We  in Wiconsin are tired of an immoral President and the Republican asskissers that support him.  jk
Hmmm, higher gas prices, rising healthcare, rising interest costs...great job mike you suck
They're super-duper popular! Mother told me so!
Tax cuts don't mean nearly as much when you, Pence, go around all over the world continually running your mouth in lies about the taxes and increasingly wasting taxes for your senseless gaddings!
Your doing a fantastic job
Thank you Vice president Pence

Ha. My taxes are going way up. Thanks for nothing.

Welcome to the epitome of a wolf in sheep's clothing acting as if he was Godly trying to destroy the American people
Does Mother know there may be other women there?
Will you also be talking about all the many, many billions of dollars Wall Street saved and spent on stock buybacks? Many people are worried about the exploding deficit, but at least the bankers are richer.
Still campaigning?

Any idea what to say about the trillion dollar deficit that’s coming?
Or will you just tell those hard working Americans that they’re fucked?
Mike, just STFU already.
Resign.
Ummmm can't prove that by me. 
I got nothing. And my 401k has been impacted and gas prices are going up.
The Koch brothers & Waldens are doing great though. I am sure they'll be very generous when they pay you back with @GOP campaign contributions.

#TrumpPenceTaxScam
He's lying, as usual.
For a very small percentage of working families. Y'all want to do something for working families, bump the minimum wage to be more livable so people don't have to get 2+ jobs to make ends meet and not see their family that much. Or do y'all not really like working families?
You, @realdonaldtrump and @GOP can spin this bullshit anyway you want ... lies are still lies. Americans earning under $100,000 are NOT reaping any reward from tax cuts and the deficit has exploded. You clowns will be collecting your pensions while citizens pay it down.
#GOPTaxScam has to be a hard sell in @IronStache land
Sorry Sacks Of Semen. I pray you reap what you sow. 
Speaking now in Milwaukee about how much bull shit we snuck past the American people. Trump Tax Cuts are already lining the pockets of the top one percent. We amaze ourselves on how stupid people really are.

I'm not surprised people haven't been noticing the TCJA in their paychecks. Even if everyone adjusted their withholding perfectly, more than half (56%) of families would see a tax change of $20 or less (including a…

UNETHICAL PIECE OF SH^IT!
Mike, don't forget to pick up your Koch check as you exit Wisconsin.

WOW! what planet do you live on...I think your more delusional then potus.  for just standing by allowing him to destroy democracy.


So, you're lying. Cool, cool.
THE TRUMP TAX CUTS ARE NOT REMOTELY MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR WORKING FAMILIES - THEY ARE PERMITTING COMPANY SHARE BUYBACKS AND ELEVATING THE INTERESTS OF SO-CALLED "SHAREHOLDERS."  THEY ARE DOING NOTHING FOR US.
IDIOT!
Hmm, wonder what the audience thinks.

Tax cut hoax
