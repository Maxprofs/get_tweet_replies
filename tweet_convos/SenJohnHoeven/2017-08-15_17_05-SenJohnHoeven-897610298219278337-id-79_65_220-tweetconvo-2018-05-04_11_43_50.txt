Condemnation by tweet are not enough WE NEED ACTION. We expect both Rep &Dem to #25ththe45th Trump has got to go
There is NO ROOM for @realDonaldTrump whose vitriolic rhetoric gives voice & instigates action to Nazis & white supremacists. Call him out!
Please vote against Mandel who is unqualified and racist
Muslims are pushing a violent agenda.
Call out by name the chief enabler of such groups. #trumpisaracist
DO SOMETHING #ImpeachTrump
U must call DT out or your words mean nothing. @realDonaldTrump=White Supremacist=Alt Right=White Nationalist=Nazi
#FireBannonMillerGorka
So what are you going to do about the PRESIDENT? He is encouraging this.
Make this a stronger statement. No room for @realDonaldTrump.  #UnfitToServe North Dakota.  #ImpeachDonaldTrump #MorallyBankrupt
Then call @potus into account for normalizing hate groups. @GOP is responsible if they do not censure him for supporting racist organization
And Antifa who are masked wonders at inciting violence.
"Whataboutism"
You mean like these white superemacists
White people elected him wanting a shake up. It's ok to say you made a mistake. Plz, b4 he shakes our country apart.
Stand up to Trump. Name him.
The only thing missing from your tweet is @realDonaldTrump.
.@POTUS is telling us there are "fine people" in their groups. GOP is complicit. Impeach him. Malicious, dangerous embarrassment to us all.
Thank You,but now do more than tweet about it....#action speaks louder than a tweet
Call out the President specifically for his unhinged support of white supremacists.  Action is stronger than words. #ImpeachTrump
Don't forget #BlackLivesMatter or #Antifa riots
Indeed, Senator! Now turn those words to action and help us get that Nazi bigoted mobster crook out of our White House.
ANY hate group ... you only mentioned half of the equation, John.
wow, you sure gave that some thought...pathetic response to Trump's words
North Dakota and South Dakota are not far behind with 59 and 58 percent approval ratings respectively. You support racism and hate
It's called domestic terrorism initiated by white supremacists who voted for @realDonaldTrump -- who use his name to defend their actions.
Really?! Because the leader of your party, is one
Please save this country and Impeach him! Impeach Trump now!
Like the group in the White House does?  Miller, Gorka, Bannon, and Trump need to go.  Stand up and help to end this with action Senator!
"There is no one righteous, not even one" Romans 3:10 We all need Jesus in our hearts!
sir, you'll win re-election regardless. You can speak your conscience about the man in the Oval. Please be a leader.
So what are you gonna do about it? Trump is supporting their cause! Are you simpatico? When you do not choose, you still have made a choice!
They are coming to #NorthDakota (Kulm)
Remove Trump. There is no room for him by your own admission.
I agree.  There is NO ROOM for an American President with a racist agenda.  Your party needs to do more than tweet.
The White House of full of them m. Fix it
Actions speak louder than words. #GetHimOut #ImpeachTrumpNow
Talk is cheap. Reinstate the Voter Rights Amendment. Pass a law to end Gerry mandering. Action speaks louder than words
Then why do you allow white supremacists Gorka, Bannon and Miller to stay in the @WhiteHouse?
Agree but also you can't have a posse bludgeoning people. You can have contempt but to hurt others is wrong.
Finally! Now #DoYourJob! Get that crazy man out before we have #WWIII or the next #CivilWar. Tweets are cheap. Your behavior has led us here
Do your duty, Senator. #ImpeachTrump. No #WhiteNationalistsintheWhiteHouse
Keep supporting a real bad person then.  Cause he has a R next to his name your will go around it.  Don't be another suit.
why did trump use the tragic death of a young women as an opportunity to talk about his "large winery"? promoting his junk again? awful!!!!
What action are you taking to support your statement? It is past time to #impeach the racist president @realDonaldTrump #action
please remove trump,  he supports nazism... oh, and he has lost his mind
Does that include your president?  Need action, not more platitudes!
Tell this to president.
Be like President Trump and denounce all violent groups. Neo-Nazi and WS do not have a lock on violence. We are tired of the one sided slant
Those darn antifa almost rammed a car into the peaceful neo Nazis but thankfully the nazis struck first. (100% sarcasm)
Well then stand up. Twitter won't help. Stand UP
I agree to let all of us stand united let not have any group black life matter or KKK or neo nazis or white supremacist  BLM are violent too
Why are you posting on a North Dakota Senator's feed when you are from California?  Are you originally from here?
yes i used to but not anymore thank god
You need to denounce the vile unhinged man we saw today. He is incapable of leading this country. You know it. Just say it.
That was fast!
There's apparently room in the @WhiteHouse
Finally!  So Senator do repudiate POTUS remarks?
The Dems promote violence to keep control
Then call for impeachment #ImpeachTrump
Yeah I'd probably jump off the sinking ship now while you still can
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ANTIFA, BLM, ETC EITHER THAT R FUNDED BY NEO-NAZI GEORGE SOROS SO B READY FOR WHAT W/HAPPEN IF U DON'T STOP THIS SHIT!
Drinking the kool-aid, are we?
GO READ MORE FICTION HARRY POTTER LITTLE SISSY SNOWFLAKE, REALITY WILL SMACK U IN THE FACE ONE DAY!
its time Congress labels them the terrorists that they are. Stop pussyfooting around this.
Absolutely not and America does not need destructive groups like the Resistance! MLK was peaceful advocate.

This is how #HillaryClinton treats people who disagree with her. H, this is why you lost. #Tatiana
