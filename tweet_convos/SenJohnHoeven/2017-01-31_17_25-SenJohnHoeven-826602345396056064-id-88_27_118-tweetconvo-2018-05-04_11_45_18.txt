Please vote for your constituents and not your party! Say NO to DeVos!
I fear a lost cause: $$$, just elected, kids private school, not a leader, stuck like a tick to the GOP.
Where is the coward Hoeven hiding? Under Trump's or DeVos's desk?
is ignoring his voters. We don't want Devos, but he's going with the  instead of his obligation to People of ND.
@dgmaccurl The silence on @BetsyDeVos at @usedgov from @SenJohnHoeven is disturbing. #DumpDeVos #SavetheBears
Listen to your constituents! We want a NO from you on DeVos!  Our kids are not an experiment and we want a worthy sec. of Ed!
I've got kids in public schools, and I like the teachers. They're good. Please listen or get voted out. #VoteNoOnDeVos
Thanks to @SenatorHeitkamp for choosing people over party. Billionaire DeVos is wrong for our kids. #shame #NoonDeVos
A Personal Message to #SCOTUSnominee Merrick Garland #MerrickGarland #SCOTUS
so did Merrick Garland...we all know how that worked out...
Two days left to see whether you can actually put those "big boy" pants on by voting against an oblivious for Ed Sec, DeVos.
@SenateGOP Merrick Garland.
Gorsuch believes Corporations come first, money second and people, well unless your lily white, counting might not exist.
and garland didn't??
@SenateGOP @SenateGOP Listen 2 yr email messages! Empty yr voicemail! Listen to MAJORITY who did not vote 4 #Trump!!
You're not at all concerned about Fascism Forever? Or that it's a stolen seat? North Dakotans are ashamed of you.
What next? A racist A.G. in http://Sessions.One  need only to be alive to know Sessions beliefs.
Well, Senator Hoeven could not find his "big boy" pants and voted for DeVos, one completely devoid of educational knowledge.
Heidi's letter sent out to ND newspapers was spot on. Why are u voting for a Billionaire who is not qualified for Sec of ED?
I recommend that you read this article. The Republican Fausts https://nyti.ms/2jQ4OGP 
Your office in GF is failing taxpayers. No one answers the phone.  No one calls back. No one answers the door. UNACCEPTABLE.
W/ Hoeven voting for DeVos & now m/b Sessions, it is obvious that the teachings of Jesus no longer lives in the repub party.
since when does that matter?  Betsy Devos doesn't have the experience to be a lunch lady but she's rich, right?
#GarlandBeforeGorsuch for #SupremeCourt #MerrickGarland deserves your vote. He can sew our divided nation back together
Please vote NO to DeVos! Put politics aside and think of the students. She is not good for rural education. Vote NO to DeVos
disagree.  Also listen to constituents and vote NO on Devos
Who do you serve? Putin? Just like your best buddy Trump?
please vote NO on sec of Ed nom. Our children and America future depend on it. Kids with disabilities matter! All kids matter
Remember this moderate judge named Merrick Garland that you ignored?  What ever happened there?  He seemed very qualified.
@SenateGOP please vote NO for DeVos- our children deserve better!
#DumpDevos do the right thing for your country and constituents
you need to rethink this statement if that's what you believe. Serious concerns with this pick...along with DeVos.
President Obama nominated an exceptionally qualified candidate months ago, yet Senate republicans refused to do their jobs
I'm waiting your announcement that you are going to vote against DeVos, in ND you cared . . . you should care about kids now.
Merrick Garland had the experience to serve well. #GarlandBeforeGorsuch
The signs are right in front of you. Are you a White Supremacist? Is that why you stay silent?
so did merrick garland your point?
Judge Gorsuch has a record siding with corporations over individuals & is VERY conservative. Need a moderate
@SenateGOP Позвольте Уточнить: Что Это - За *Необходимый...* Опыт? И Кому, Судья Нил Горсуч - Должен *Хорошо...* Служить?
So did Merrick Garland....
@SenateGOP you know who had the necessary experience to serve the scotus well? #MerrickGarland
@SenateGOP You're all a disgrace, literally stole that seat from the 1st blk president, history will remember you as villains

Clearly many North Dakotans disagree. Do the right thing, Senator.
as an ND resident and a woman, I'm against this decision
#DumpDevos NOW
and so was Merrick Garland!! Disgraceful how GOP treated President Obama and his nominee!  So extremely disappointed in you!
DO you agree with White Supremacists/Radicalized Christians running the USA? #ImpeachTrump Stand for the proud people of ND.
You have sold your soul. Here is what the Republican Party has become told to us by a Republican. http://m.dailykos.com/story/2017/01/31/1628060/-David-Brooks-roasts-his-Republican-Party-for-their-deal-with-the-devil-But-the-COMMENTS?detail=facebook …
How is believing corporations are people a "strict interpretation of the constitution? You obstructed Obama, hypocrite.
Did Merrick Garland lack the "necessary experience to serve well"?
The republican process getting to this point with the supreme court is simply the ends justify any means of getting there.
A vote for DeVos for ed., would be a vote totally against public schools and for someone ignorant of educational testing.
well his child did go to St Mary's so his concern for public education may not be up there
Just remember, Gorsuch places Corporations first, money second, and we, the people last. Same old same old for republicans.
yes a long history of ruling against workers and womens health and being very pro corporate, helping big Corp. works for you?
What do you know about anything except taking $$ from corporations & turning your back on people who elected you. PRIMARY HIM
You know who else was nominated and had great experience? Merrick Garland.

His history/actions have shown he is against #EqualRights must be blocked for 1,450 days.
why wasn't garland?
disagree. Not what this North Dakotan wants. Disappointed in your representation to say the least.
@NastyNortDakota @SenJohnHoeven Wish we could get a swell of protesters there. Wonder what changed at Army Corps of Engineers.
Political pressure.I'm sure.
Exactly. And quite an obvious lack of integrity. I wonder what the carrot was... #resist
as did Merrick Garland, but he wasn't even given a hearing.
you sir are just another henchman for potus... seen you adding me to a group of #NorthDakotanstoignore so you feel good
don't trust the judgment of a moron who picks Devos, Sessions, and Bannon. #OpposeDeVos #nobannon #nosessions #NoBanNoWall
