God hates your prayer and the 2nd amendment. STOP taking money from NRA. You are complicit and have blood on your hands. #GunControl
perhaps in addition to your thoughts and prayers you could stop taking NRA $ and do your job to prevent the next shooting
"Praying"? If you gave a shit about these people, your thoughts would be with gun control, not accepting money from the NRA.
That's wonderful that you're "praying" for victims! How about that $8,450 you accepted from the NRA in 2016? There is blood on YOUR hands.
Your prayers do nothing and NRA money fills your bank account. #emptythoughtsfullpockets
One of the top earners ($8415) during the 2016 election cycle. Your votes are bought and paid for.
Stop taking NRA moneystand up and save lives
Hi Mikey and @SenJohnHoeven  Could you donate the money the NRA gave you in 2016 cycle to the Las Vegas victim's fund? $8,450?
Excellent Tweet @PibbleRacing 

#NRA PAYS THESE WHORES...excuse me POLITICIANS
Praying is harder than accepting blood money apparently.
#BanAssaultWeapons #BanBumpStocks #BanHighCapacityMagazines
praying is not enough anymore.  Do something about the bump stock & the amount of guns & ammo one can purchase.  It's insanity.
GIVE THIS MAN THE NOBLE PEACE PRIZE WOW I MEAN IS HE SUPER-HUMAN HOLY SHIT HE FIXED EVERYTHING
Our words say 'We're so sorry' & our actions say 'Who cares?'
To the victims of this tragedy we send our thoughts & prayers.

-Roy Zimmerman
How much are your prayers worth? More or less than $8,450? #NRA #NRAKills #NRABloodMoney #LasVegasShooting
If all ur good for is prayers and payouts then please leave politics and join the priesthood. #ResistTheNRA
hollow words. That doesn't bring 60 of my neighbors back from the dead.
$17,499 worth of prayers, right? Good try, and this is entirely on you. #NRA
Hopefully you will help pass some common sense legislation on gun control! That would be an answer to prayers.
Sending love...prayers peace
Still praying4de fams of Sandy hook elementary school 20CHILDREN HYPOCRITS 

JUST PUT IN PLACE SENSIBLE GUN REFORM ALL WERE ASKIN4 #phonies
NRA 2016 contributions:
Hoeven, John (R-ND)Senate$8,450
God and Las Vegas don't want your useless prayers.
Give back the over $8000 you took from the NRA, take legislative action, and maybe people will take your useless prayers seriously.
That $8450 in NRA money would probably help some of those shooting victims. OR, you could just keep it and continue to ignore the problem.
North Dakota Senator John Hoeven received $8,450 from the #NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
how about you and Mikey stop receiving money from the NRA instead? that would actually help, you moron
North Dakota Senator John Hoeven received $8,450 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
You have blood on your hands.
.@SenJohnHoeven You accepted $8,450 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle. Your prayers mean nothing.
I'm grateful if you would stop praying and start acting. I'm sure 1st responders would be too, if they didn't have to come to these scenes.
Are you going to help pass some gun control legislation, or just stay there on your knees praying uselessly?
For someone who has taken NRA money, your "prayers" remark is unbelievably offensive.
Prayers are great but how about you donate the money the NRA gave you to the victim’s families? That would send a message.
may you please also send the NRA their money back. or better yet donate it to save lives. thank you.
I'd be grateful if you stopped lying and admit you care more about that blood money the NRA gives you than the victims.

With respect, sir.  Keep your prayers. I want your vote for common sense gun control. #NRA #LasVegas
Prayers but no Thoughts? Don't you know the script? This is not how you tragedy.
Keep your feckless “thoughts & prayers.”

Gun Control is a Pro Life issue
Please fund research to help find answers
Great, now what's the game plan? Please call for a bipartisan effort to do something to prevent this from happening again.
get off those knees. You're kneeling for the NRA, not God. #BloodMoney 

YOU DID THIS!
Stop taking NRA money- pass common sense gun laws

Pray for your next payment from @NRA. You owe them. They own you. Don’t forget.

@RepPoliquin Starting to regret those NRA campaign contributions yet? #YouHelpedThisHappen
Forget the prayers. Do something real. Stop taking money (over $8,000 in 2016) from the NRA & put sane protections in place.
Their jobs would be easier if you weren't so easily swayed by NRA dollars.  You are just as guilty as Stephen Paddock
You took NRA funds. Now vote agaist assault weapons & armor-piercing ammo.  Require careful checks before purchasing.
I’m a resident in Henderson NV. We don’t need your prayers. You took money from NRA. Get these automatic rifles off the streets

right because praying keeps us safe.  DONAOMETHING YOU GUTLESS PIECE OF SHIT
We would be grateful if you passed some laws to protect us.  Reject NRA money.

@kurteichenwald: Does the NRA install automatic "thoughts & prayers" buttons on lawmakers keyboards while bringing bags of cash  /1
2 their offices?  #ActOrShutUP  /end
stop with the prayers... since there is nothing Christian about you... your NRA support shows you stand with white terrorism
...yes, praying for victims, and praying for more NRA money @SenJohnHoeven
North Dakota Senator John Hoeven received $8,450 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
Instead of praying Senator, you should return the $8,450 dollars the @NRA gave you and #ACT with your #VOTE. #shame
Prayers don't stop terrorists from killing people. Blood is on your hands for bowing to the @NRA. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
@RepTomEmmer, how does it feel to pray knowing you accepted $8,450 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle?
the NRA paid you less than your colleagues. Stop getting paid by the NRA to look the other way. LV blood is on your hands.
Aw how sweet- so. What part of your campaign/life/dinner did you use your NRA $$ for???
Governing Officials if not now when! We are human! Evil is all around! Prayer works when we are righteous! How ye?
Pray works after you have done all that you can to stand!
Get to some serious governing!
I am praying that u stop taking NRA $$$, that u man up & pass meaningful gun legislation, that u stop insulting me with hollow platitudes
Shame on you for accepting money from the NRA. You’re a murderer. Fix this
You took $8.5k from the NRA to get elected. Are you willing to challenge them, or will you stick with "thoughts & prayers"?
It's a Holy and wholesome thing to pray for the dead and injured. It's insulting to them to not take action to prevent future tragedies.
Republican Jesus: Gather your automatic weapons, stockpile ammo, slaughter your brothers and sisters. Let the blood run. God Bless the NRA $
Mickey should pray for your hollow soul. Do something! Senator John Hoeven received $8,450 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
John, you take money from the NRA. You're part of the problem. Are you going to change, or are prayers all you've got?
and your pockets are lined with NRA CASH
if u really care about 1st responders youd want effective gun control instead of taking a ton of $$$ from NRA
Maybe you could do something helpful rather than pray & take NRA $$ - pass common sense #GunControlNow! #ComplicitGop
How about praying for the balls to return the blood money the NRA gave u & work for gun control? If not, the victims' blood's on your hands.
North Dakota Senator John Hoeven received $8,450 from the NRA during the 2016 election cycle.
who cares what u Native American beaters think? Take ur $ from NRA murderers & give to victims fund.
