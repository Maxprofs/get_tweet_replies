@marcorubio Kinda reminds me of your really big #AmnestyBill which does not secure the border and gives welfare to illegals! #StopAmnesty
Just like how the more guns there are out there, the more gun related deaths there are likely to be? @marcorubio
@marcorubio @PJStrikeForce 
Sir, you are apart of that very system!
If your against it get out and expose them. We see through the smoke!
@DanielCrane81 @PJStrikeForce @marcorubio Happy Hump Day, It "We The People"
@marcorubio Then why aren't you leading an effort to eliminate the IRS and go to flat tax?
@marcorubio @SensibleLifeJoe And U are pushing the other big FRAUD on the American People! #NoAmnesty #LiarFraud #SleepingWithTraitors #tcot
@marcorubio With logic like that, good thing you are a Republican.
@marcorubio Time to fix this Senator. You need to support #FairTax and abolish the #IRS. Time to prove you're a true #Conservative. #tcot
@marcorubio same with banks and corp.
@Foystein1 @marcorubio Oh, come on. Banks & corps can't kill you or destroy your life like big gov't can. See Home Depot story from OK.
@writingdownpat @marcorubio ever hear of dupont?
@marcorubio @CoxWebDev lets be honest, corruption more likely web a Dem in office
@marcorubio Government will be a little smaller when we get rid of YOU!!
@marcorubio Why is it that u have much 2 tweet about the IRS but nothing re your bill to secure our borders? No more BS....
@marcorubio a reminder tht whn u're in charge, govt expands, illegals steal jobs & benefits,commit crimes & vote dem, while Americans suffer
@marcorubio ...and you also want to rapidly expand government through your #shamnesty #immigration bill?! Sorry, your words mean nothing.
@marcorubio At this point you have  no credibility with conservatives with your "Amnesty" agenda. what about Immigrants that done it legally
Clearly, with Gov expanding exponentially under O, now is not the time for your immigration plan. It increases the size of Gov. @marcorubio
@marcorubio @SladeOBrien you are trying to make govt bigger with the immigration bill #immigration #amnesty #tcot #doublestandards
@latinthinker FYI: I never said I supported that bill.
@SladeOBrien it's ok. Just wanted to keep you in the loop in case @marcorubio answered.
@latinthinker  :)
@marcorubio @New0rleans_Lady IKE -deport
@marcorubio @WeGotEd @BarackObama 
The two leaders of the IRS are R appts by Bush? No replacement! Leaderless like Katriinas Brown
@marcorubio now 
immigration reform all but signed How R-YOU planning 2stop libs when they have lied n illegals will continue 2get govt aid
@marcorubio Really? Is that why you became Schumers' republican?
@marcorubio when you got Gvt assistance Marco, you never complained it was too big
@marcorubio 

Lip-service to bipartisanship? Check. 

Appeal to the smaller government GOP base? Check.

#coverallthebases #sneaky #slimey
@marcorubio  (clap clap clap) good job getting your scam out of committee. Nice job stabbing Reagan in the back from the grave.
@marcorubio what is scarier is both parties are in cahoots. I will not vote for you again sir. Had a lot of hope in you. Adios y cuidate
@marcorubio Set an example. If you want smaller government, get out of it.
@marcorubio: "so... support me in any big govt boondoggle I approve! which is all of them!"
@marcorubio @NASCARNAC 2012 ELECTION Do-OverTime? #DOJ #Killary #Immigr #FandF #Bengahzi #Fraud #IRS #TeaParty #OC http://northamericanlawcenter.org/notice-to-congressional-election-certification …
@tasteofaz @marcorubio @NASCARNAC if we could impeach @marcorubio we would, he's in bed with schumer now, he sold out,  #amnesty #tcot
@1purple50 @marcorubio @NASCARNAC rubio's done
@tasteofaz @marcorubio @NASCARNAC rubio is in bed with schumer and we get screwed, NO to rubio #amnesty
@marcorubio @NASCARNAC your pseudo immigration reform does not conform w/ psychobabble 2 sell this charade 2 American people..SHAME on you!
@marcorubio @SenMikeLee Abolish the #IRS!! Go with #FairTax!  The IRS and the current Administration are definitely #CorruptToTheCore 
#tcot
@marcorubio @Ledamaae The needles stay the same size, the haystack gets exponentially larger.
@marcorubio @Ledamaae suddenly you sound like Ron Paul. It sells doesn't it?
@marcorubio Not arguing for big gov't, just that it feels like a solution finding a problem.  1974- gov't was 50% as big but had Watergate.
@marcorubio Perhaps if government was 1/4 the size.  Short of that, strong oversight & a strong/independent press are much more important.
@marcorubio So let's add 30 million more to the welfare rolls. That should help to shrink govt. Imm  reform is a joke. Enforce  current laws
@marcorubio Best Tweet 'O the Day!
@marcorubio Oh pls. Go get water for Schumer. OK?
.@marcorubio @jonbouy00 Take that lovely sentiment and apply it to the immigration bill you're so proud of, Mr. Rubio.
@marcorubio same with illegal immigration #hypocrite.
@marcorubio #whereisJoebiden why is Joe Biden hiding
@marcorubio time to remove IRS and have a flat tax. Please start to impeach
@marcorubio Kind of like your shamnesty bill.
@marcorubio @RennaW thank you for attempting to appeal to a wide voting base !
@marcorubio Yes! Checks and balances are right and best.
@marcorubio the #IRSscandal is a reminder that lawmakers who can't lead simply whine about scandals. Clean energy requires leadership.
@marcorubio #NoAmnesty #TREASON That's rich coming from YOU: Your AMNESTY plan would EXPAND government & spending to levels never imagined.
@marcorubio  sure thing RINO.  ass kissing idiot
@marcorubio and that is a fact. Too big to function, too big to serve and too big to represent the people it is designed to serve.
@marcorubio Plus it is very difficult to get rid of employees who abuse the system.
@marcorubio You mean like minority groups abusing process to impose their agendas on the rest of us?
@marcorubio Agree 100%! Will we ever get to point where we have had enough! I'm there!
@marcorubio @owendbanks then do something term limits.
@marcorubio That's the right message. Keep it up. Now don't make the govt bigger by dumping immigrants on to our welfare system.
@marcorubio You mean like rewarding 11 million law breakers with citizenship? I know what ya mean, it's really pathetic!!
@marcorubio you think there would be less abuse if the IRS were smaller? That makes no sense, they are the only ones stopping tax cheaters.
@marcorubio Never was a work spoken (or tweeted) more true.
@marcorubio RE last, absolutely correct Senator.
@marcorubio @SenMikeLee It's not so much "the abuse of power;"it's "the power to abuse" that scares regular Americans!
#tcot #tgdn @GOP #tea
@marcorubio the obstruction in the house shows that as long as the GOP/TP are elected no work will get done & only lies & obstruction occur.
@marcorubio the likely hood for abuse is 10 fold
@marcorubio so you want to add to govt by increasing population of illegals.  Fear you've turned into a rino!
@marcorubio @SunflowerGal356 How about putting your hatred for YOUR president aside, & doing the work that you were elected to do.
@marcorubio that is why we need to shrink the size of the federal gov' t when elected officials can't control or don't know what's going on
@marcorubio @SunflowerGal356 You & your desperate compadres are so busy barking up the IRS tree when there are serious issues to be solved.
@marcorubio Please apply that sentiment to your Amnesty endeavors!
@marcorubio Most of size of government comes from social security, Medicare, and defense. Which of these do you propose cutting?
@marcorubio so can we reverse it from bigger to smaller? Ir has it gone too far as politicians benefit too much?
@marcorubio Which doesn't change the fact that we NEED gov't. Food safety. Education. Infrastructure. Duh.
@marcorubio And you trust these crooks to actually enforce border security?  Naive beyond belief!
@marcorubio @SenMikeLee why make it bigger with Obamacare, death panels, immigration, IRS. Enough already Senator we can't take anymore.
@marcorubio YOUR RADIO AD IS A LIE.STATES THAT ILLEGALS WILL NOT GET WELFARE AND BENEFITS.WHAT DO U CALL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. DON'T LIE
@marcorubio Amen Senator! Let's do something about it!
@marcorubio reminder that you and your cohorts do nothing to correct these things. You are all in it together. Shameful
@marcorubio Start streamlining tax code & IRS by eliminating loopholes that allow billionaires & corps to pay lower % than average worker.
@marcorubio 100% agree !!!
@marcorubio And cutting Medicare and Medicaid prevents government abuses how exactly?
@marcorubio  Rubio said so well "No matter who is in charge, Rep or Democrat, the bigger govt the more likelihood of abuse @mtchellreports
@marcorubio  and what about the immigration "scandal " your are helping with. we will get t bottom of your involvement
.@marcorubio And in a smaller government the abuses will come from the private sector. This problem could be fixed with legislation. Solved!
@marcorubio Exactly. And the Gang Of 8 Imigration Bill is a HUGE power garb and growth of central government. You are being scrutinized
@marcorubio Likely hood , Really Marco !?? Big Government " DOES" Abuse! Period !!!!
MT !!! “@marcorubio: This #IRSscandal a reminder that no matter who in charge,Rep or Dem, the bigger the government, the more likely abuse”
@marcorubio Amen!  Our Founding Fathers understood man's nature.
@marcorubio you and Ron Paul for 2016!
@marcorubio If you were president, which depts would you shut down?
@marcorubio Please, no amnesty.  No security on borders, no amnesty.  Period.
@marcorubio Do democrats believe in a Republican Government like Benjamin Franklin and the rest of the founding fathers?
@marcorubio Tax reform would pave the path to abolish IRS
@marcorubio DING!!! and thats why Illegal Immigration MUST B dealt with SIMPLY. Deport&make them do it legal. #tcot #tlot #ctot #ccot #pjnet
@marcorubio Senate Judiciary Committee voted Monday to allow illegal immigrants who get legal status to begin collecting welfare payments!
@marcorubio Just as likely those same people who r corruor in govrnmnt wld b corrupt in private sector
@marcorubio So does that mean the bigger the defense department (govt) the more likely the abuse. So you're for major cuts to defense?
@timkephart33 @marcorubio DOD HAS been cut/ Bulk of budget is only 17% SS&Medicare r 58% http://nationalpriorities.org/en/analysis/2013/president-obamas-fiscal-year-2014-budget/?gclid=CJiyn5nbp7cCFc4DOgod1XAAKA … #tcot #pjnet thx 4 playn
