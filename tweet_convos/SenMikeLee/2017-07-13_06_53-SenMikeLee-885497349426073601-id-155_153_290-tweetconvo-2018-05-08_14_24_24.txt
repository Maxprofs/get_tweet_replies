Most Americans lose under the Senate healthcare bill. You will too if you vote for it.
Lee and Cruz must stand their ground and for gods sake let's get rid of the cancer McConnell
Agree is like staying in two bed breakfasts, on my way to Niagara Falls, both had artificial  plants that needed replacing badly
Great analogy Barbara
No to Trumpcare! Many Republicans, Dems & experts, (medical, @AARPadvocates etc are against & the popular voters.
Instead of patriotic Conservatives speaking out #LOUD_N CLEAR, fighting against tyranny, rebuffing the unjust assault on our POTUS..#SILENCE
The idea of REPLACE should be outright REJECTED. A one page legislation #FULLY_REPEALING_Ocare is all that's needed. The POTUS will sign it.
Most Americans lose under the Senate healthcare bill.
If we give any legitimacy to ANY control of our healthcare 2CivilGOV all Americans lose except for those exempt   & have private healthcare.
The goal of this old Statist trojan horse is #POWER & #CONTROL not the well being of the citizen who becomes subject 2 "some live, some die"
@SenMikeLee we need full REPEAL! Nothing else is beneficial to the people or the country! 
When you on a long trip, their are detours, road blocks to get to your final designation,  It's not done in one giant leap.  Have faith
Make them change it back to the way it was originally written by you & Sen Cruz. You hold all the cards. Talk to Prez Trump
Kill this bill!!! It's either that or killing innocent Americans.
CBO estimates that 22 M will lose coverage, premiums will increase in 2018 & benefits will decrease if bill passes.
This bill is a disaster! You might as well be one of the few who #KeepTheirPromise of #FullRepeal or No Deal! If passes GOP own it.

We the American citizens were promised repeal and replace, that is what we will only agree to, keep promise.
@SenMikeLee  and Constitutionalists promised REPEAL. They promised to get government out of health care, not another government boondoggle.
Why haven't you already read it, also the taxes put in by Obama hurt the American, only thing to do repeal and replace.
They promised repeal. Gov needs to get out of health care & ins. Everything costs more when gov gets involved, either higher prices or taxes
Mike, hope you & @tedcruz can Impliment Healthcare Bill 4 Interstate Free Markets & Tort Reform. $7,000 lower Premiums, 2 mil more covered?
this new healthcare bill, if passed would you yourself want to be covered by it if not then why pass it All in Gov should be under this bill
AHIP opposes the Senate healthcare bill. They say it will undermine insurance markets & increase premiums.
Please say NO. My US friends need their health care. Thank you.
Right - and who exactly are you?
I voted for you but I promise to do everything possible to see you lose next time if you vote for this horrible health care bill!!!!!
Please don't.  Forcing a healthy person to pay more for health insurance because I have asthma is 100% not fair to them 
Read carefully. Do the right thing. Vote for affordable healthcare not a corrupt version of "cover my campaign promise & I'll cover yours."
Americans are finally learning that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans give a hoot about their welfare. 2018 & 2020 is 3rd party time
No - just elect more Freedom Caucus / Tea Party candidates. Replace in primaries. We don't want the Communist Dem party in power again.
Cruelty, thy name is Mike Lee. No BCRA. No amendments.
You can still keep your wonderful OCare coverage under this bill if that's what you want.
2018 will be ugly, if we don't get healthcare through. Find a way to make it happen!
If you don't vote for it then you will own Obamacare!!! Unconscionable and unacceptable!!!
TELL YOUR COWORKERS WE WANT THE OBAMA DEATHCARE NIGHTMARE TO BE SENT BACK TO HELL THIS WEEK! THANK YOU!
http://money.cnn.com/2010/03/23/markets/markets_newyork/index.htm …
Why is it that Congress is exempting themselves from Obamacare, is it because you would also be exempt from the taxes in Obamacare? No good!
Please scrap all amendments and stick to a #FullRepeal.
Don't vote for this replacement bill. Repeal only first.
Please, Senator, vote no on BCRA. It hurts the neediest among us and helps the wealthiest among us by giving them a tax break.
Please do not vote for this bill. It will hurt the most valuable. My son!


"Passing “something” is not better than nothing. Passing bills is not progress. Doing the right thing is progress."
#KillTheBill Vote NO Senator Lee!!!

Nay to rescue the conservative movement.
why would you want to buy a burning house.
Plz protect your constituents from #Trumpcare. 

@realDonaldTrump has filed 6 bankruptcies.  
He survived, but can they?

#VoteNo
Don't sell your vote to Mike Pence - tantamount to selling your soul to the Devil
Still withhold judgment after seeing this?
It's an albatross with your name on it. Smart to tank it, as  it will kill those w/pre-existing/64+ & it bears your name.
Well, it's been two days. An amendment does not take even one day to read and comprehend. What is your stance?
Voting for this bill is voting to kill Americans. You will be more successful than ISIS at killing Americans if this passes.
I fixed it for you, Senator.
Nice move, congress exempts themselves from new bill, if its good enough for us,should be good enough for you Nov 2018
From the constitution you are to defend the general welfare of the citizens of the whole United States. Rework not Repeal
Cancer is not a Corvette. You get no choice on choosing it. Take profit out of health care. Rework not repeal.
It's a disaster! Americans deserve the same coverage we pay 4  @gop 2 have! #VoteNoBCRA People deserve coverage more than McConnells pride
THERE IS NO PERFECT BILL SO U NEED TO GET IT DONE WITH WHAT WE HAVE.IF NOT, U ALL WILL NOT BE RE ELECTED.BYE.
MANY OF U WILL LOSE YOUR SEATS IF YOU HOLD UP THIS BILL&PREVENT OUR PRES.FROM KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO US.WE RUN THIS COUNTRY&WE WILL REMEMBER
How about a fair, honest and open debate with input instead of back room deals. You want to MAGA? Start there.
I'm calling on you to reject this terrible trumpcare bill that will reward the rich and punish good Americans. Be a hero. History will know.
Yes to Medicaid, mental health, maternity care, & preexisting condition coverage... No to your immoral and inept bill. Who do you work for?
?? -even knowing this??>>
Vote to protect Americans with disabilities, vote against cuts to Medicaid!
That I wasn't dying, I have acute general anxiety,  CPTSD, O-OCD and ADD.  Now that I receive treatment and meds. I am in school, I'm 53.
We're covered, that I bought Health insurance. I knew I had a heart condition, arthritis, major depressive disorder.
Being covered I found t
I look forward to hearing what you think. Can I read it, where is it? I'm against the former. It wasn't until by law pre-existing conditions
Pass it DAMNIT!!
Please read this letter from physicians as well.  
https://www.acponline.org/acp_policy/letters/letter_to_senate_opposing_revised_bcra_2017.pdf …
Still withholding judgment? Or looking forward to taking health care away from millions?
#KillTheBill not Americans!
Tell your senators to vote NO on healthcare bill. Text 'Resist' to 50408 to easily send letter now.
You hold our lives in your hand! Please vote 'NO'! Become our HERO! #PROTECTOURCARE
Repeal only nothing more.
Still trying to decide if it's worth it to take health care away from millions?
#trumpcarekills
Thank You for standing for the #AmericanCitizen!  Say NO to #SocializedMedicine.
Thank you for the update!
Loud Mike will fall in line and do what McConnell tells him to do.
Nothing gets done and you will make history books for letting Socialism end the U.S.Amazing this day in age people think Socialism good!
Keeping the Obama care taxes? How is this a repeal?
While you're waiting, please read how France solved healthcare.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_France …
Not Judging but I look to seeing you unemployed. #worthless #tcot #idiot
THE RICH DO NOT NEED HELP!

Nice try, but Jesus never commanded us to use government programs to help the needy.
You've helped convince America what an achievement Obamacare was based on the GOP's complete incompetence.
You promised repeal, no wait and see what it is.
Do healthcare taxes immigration we are tired of republicans afraid to govern only care is reelection not american people
Please keep us updated sir... far as I am concerned I get my news from you an @tedcruz ..cant trust any media..thank you for fighting for us
Please vote no. I'm not your constituent but your vote will affect my child who has DS and will rely on Medicaid as she becomes an adult.
hey at least you guys are #reading it, unlike #democrats did with #obamacare :P #passwithoutreading
Even pragmatic conservatism makes this bill a nonstarter. Completely altered your amendment which defeats the whole point.
I wouldn't trust your fellow senators as far as I could spit, save @tedcruz and a few others.
Why can't HC regulations be returned to the states where they belong?
Repeal and Replace NOW!!!   or you can kiss your political career good-bye.
Ted bailed on this one
PLEASE don't join him-need Full repeal as promised!
Don't institutionalize healthcare as right! No more entitlements
KEEP your promise Mike! This is not pulling ANYTHING out by the roots! #UnitedforFreedom!
I trust you to do the right thing.
2016 was 1st AND last time I vote Republican! At least Dems work together in their insanity!
You are a coward who is waiting to be told what he thinks.
PLEASE consider the risks for Medicaid. All I can imagine are loopholes. Disabled adults in Utah can not be left behind.
Hope it wasn't screwed up by some RINO-TOO IMPORTANT! I know you & Cruz have worked hard on this. God bless you guys! #GodHelpUs
REPEAL!!!!! 

@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
while you're waiting maybe you could stand up and be counted on unamerican activities of trump/russia case. histroy is waiting for good men.
Please vote no. We need to improve healthcare, not destroy it. Rural hospitals will be negatively affected most incl lost jobs.
and putting healthcare into a stagnating single payer system is 'improving it'? is this a principle we apply in any other industry?
I am one of your constituents. The ACA literally saved my life. Please, think of the Utahns with cancer or other issues. This bill is not ok
Sounds like a plan there & revolutionary idea to read a bill before you sign on to it!
Are you waiting to see how many people it'll kill before you agree to vote for it?
Are we going to have a hearing so we can all try to understand it?
If you can stomach perhaps pass it and perfect it after taxes have been addressed?
Do NOT trust McConnell!
We don't need to reinstate cheap plans that insure nothing. Cost of full coverage healthcare plans will skyrocket. Bad idea!
SKIP THE LOCAL , WHERE DO YOU STAND ON FOREIGN POLICY , DONT DO A DONALD , ELECTED ON PROMISES OF JOBS YET FLIRTING ON FORGEN ISSUES.
I'm so sick of government controlling our lives. Separate the bills and pass a complete #FullRepeal first then negotiate a replacement bill.
You too Mike.....
Eliminate govt funded healthcare for senators as well.  There, problem fixed, go home now.
#Freemarkethealthcare
Look for this to be the reaction for the next few hours.
Repeal, replace is only acceptable option.
Signed,
The Ones who voted you in
Get off your butt and read it
#CleanRepeal @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs
Do they let you read it before voting? How progressive!
At least he's willing to read the bill and not saying "we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it"
faaaaaart
What happened to normal committee process?
Urge GOP to vote NO on healthcare bill. Text 'Resist' to 50408 to easily send letter to your senator
Hey how about you actually have hearings??
You are rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

shifting the cost to others is not 'making healthcare affordable.' i can always make my costs more affordable if i steal from my neighbor.
REPEAL ALL! Then figure out a new plan this Fall
Way to still be optimistic Senator (sarc). #FullRepeal is the only path to more freedom for your constituents. Thank you for all that you do
Make sure it's Constitutional!  Or kill it!
I'm gonna hate the results of the 2018 vote if the Senate fails. I think we will loose the majority.
They deserve to lose if can't keep their word
We need HSA's (can be funded for poor by tax credits)and put patient in charge,then providers post list of costs!Add catastrophic ins plan.
Congress people is #1
Full repeal!!!
fight till the end we will prevail
Please don't pass this bill. Please don't let millions lose coverage.
We all pay more if there are millions who can only get care through ERs & cant work b/c they can't afford their medications.
Your taxes aren't being lowered by this bill unless you're a multimillionaire.
Still has us,taxpayers forced to subsidize insurance companies. Your RINOs are obstructionist partners of the Democrat. 2018 they'll be gone
America is America. We Love you Congress people

JUST IN: Insurance industry says Cruz amendment will unleash a death spiral for people with pre-existing conditions. 
It's a bad bill. Millions that have insurance today, will not if it is passed. People will go bankrupt. Do your job. Work w/Dems to fix ACA.
. Dems are the one's who screwed it up in the first place! So No to the dems!
Thank you 
I wouldn't hold my breath.
