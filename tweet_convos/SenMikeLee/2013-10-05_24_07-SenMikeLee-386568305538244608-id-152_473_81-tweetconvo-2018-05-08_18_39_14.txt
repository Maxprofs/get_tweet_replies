@SenMikeLee @vmpcott We're all VERY tired of the GOP blather.  We're sold already.  Now do what we sent you to do and #ImpeachObama !
@Nottinghams1 @SenMikeLee @vmpcott @JoAnnEileen @boehner  I used to say that last week. Now I say they just need to impeach. No more deals.
@jskrepak @Nottinghams1 @SenMikeLee @vmpcott @boehner I agree. Obama continues to lie to American people & supports our enemies. He hates US
@JoAnnEileen @Nottinghams1 @SenMikeLee @vmpcott @boehner The truth is not in him. He is incapable of good. If it's wrong, Obama is for it.
@Nottinghams1 @jskrepak @SenMikeLee @vmpcott @boehner Yep. My husband & I were appalled by the ignorance of dems & complicity of #msm.
@SenMikeLee @belvdere Good job. Keep the heat on. Agreed w/ur point about response 2 shutdown being best argument against Obamacare.
@SenMikeLee @billyraybryant @SenTedCruz @SpeakerBoehner Not surprised. You guys got to hold strong. Make him give the ppl a yr delay.
@hickory66 @billyraybryant @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SpeakerBoehner 
May take Dems that long to fix website. Will there still be penalties?
@easydoesitdav @billyraybryant @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SpeakerBoehner If he can close the WWII memorial, yes penalties will be charged.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Keep up the great work. We appreciate all your efforts. @SpeakerBoehner @SenTedCruz
@retireGOP @SenMikeLee Actually, the House of Representatives  DOES get to pick which laws get funding. Civics 101. You must have missed it.
@retireGOP @SenMikeLee All spending originates in the House of Representatives. Per the US constitution.
@retireGOP You said that House doesn't get to pick which laws get funding. As proven, it DOES get to choose. Senate can reject. Then what?
@retireGOP Senate rejection = shutdown. House has passed govt funding bills, Dems in Senate veto it. Shutdown = Dem's fault.
@SenMikeLee @BreightonSmith bcuz they don't have 2.JB should've held out 4us,r country&what's right!He always caves.Only O&dems count here!
@SenMikeLee - Why should he negotiate when you won't do your job? ObamaCare is FUCKING LAW.
Why did House stop? @SenMikeLee House continues to pass bipartisan bills to fund government. Senate Democrats & president still refuse...
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce let @HarryReid know his wake up call is coming on Friday, #T2SDA >
@SenMikeLee @se_george : unreal, something has to be done legally to stop congress from acting like spoiled BRATS! Start legal proceedings .
@SenMikeLee @vmpcott In Sept, 2009 O told Congress he needed 4yrs to get ACA right. His whole speech has proven to be a lie - ask Joe Wilson
@SenMikeLee If wouldn't have shut down the government, you wouldn't be passing bills to fund it right now! #TeapartyShutdown was the cause!
@SenMikeLee how can we get around these closures  can we defund psrk service?
@SenMikeLee Can I burn down your house? No Just the 2nd floor?  No  Garage? No Let's talk what can I burn down?  No YOU AREN'T COMPROMISING!
@SenMikeLee @gerigee8860 and the lapdog media will continue to spew as we preach to deaf ears !
@SenMikeLee @TabNP   Stand Strong Mike. You guys are saving the USA!! #tea   @SpeakerBoehner  #tea  kill #Obamacare  balance the budget
@SenMikeLee @bzaz Please pass on to the others that WE THE PEOPLE support the stand against Obamacare. STAND FIRM. #ObamaReidShutdown
@SenMikeLee @LadyofSPR Mr. LEE, You need to school them. Article 1, Section 8. GIVES CONGRESS THE RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE TAX DISPERSION.
@jeffyd37 @SenMikeLee Evidently #Presidenthissyfit doesn't have that memo. He's all about bsmirchin and passin the buck. #Impeach Already
@LadyofSPR @SenMikeLee You would think an ex-constitutional lawyer would know how this works. Keep the pressure on! MR. LEE!!!
@jeffyd37 @SenMikeLee LOL from all I read he sucked at that job too! I agree keep on the pressure we appreciate all u are doing.
@SenMikeLee Continue to fight for WETHEPPL w/ your colleagues @SenRandPaul  and @SenTedCruz we are with you and you will prevail in the end.
@SenMikeLee @MoberlyG Please tell @SpeakerBoehner  @gopconference To begin #ArticlesofImpeachment
@SenMikeLee @USAlivestrong stand strong!!!!
@lauracupp @SenMikeLee People have to se this is all a result of Barrys stubborn insistence on having his way or else!
@USAlivestrong @SenMikeLee Just like a dictator.
@lauracupp @SenMikeLee Not quite! He still fears our Constitutional strngth and guns! More like petulent child!
@SenMikeLee @ladynra1 This Doesn't sound like the Republicans are keeping the gov shutdown. to me
@sandismom @ladynra1 @SenMikeLee This falls solely in Dem hands now! Can't hide it! Wake up sheeple!
@SenMikeLee THAnk you for just amitg on fox this shutdwn is how doing fundg 1 at a time is all about defund ocare which 72% amer are against
@SenMikeLee @chipwoods Obstructionist Democrat Senate refuses to pass funding bills that Constitutionally begin in House. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @Lurayrom #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee @Bigballzz77 And you, sir, still haven't signed up for Ocare. Your a hero, but it's hypocritical for Gov ppl not to have Ocare.
@SenMikeLee @miaconserv2 Don't give up. Stick to your guns. The people are counting on you. End this dictatorship and make Obama negotiate.
@SenMikeLee @chrisenloe Keep it up. The more petty the Dems get, the more folks understand the fight. Put them on the record.
@SenMikeLee Isn't using NPS personnel and supplies for political goals contrary to the statutory mission of the NPS an 18 USC 641 felony?
@SenMikeLee @CaskieW + Don't let him play President anymore.It is clear he doesn't play well with others so give him a time out in a corner
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater We support you Senator & tell your melee mouth squishy colleagues to man up & do what they promised to do.
I'm trying to figure out the financial logic behind giving back pay to gov employees that we have sent home @SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater
@Bloviate_Barbie @SenMikeLee WHERE IS THE BACK PAY FOR MILLIONS W/ HOURS CUT OR JOB LOSS? This is O pandering to his precious gvt employees.
It just makes no sense. If we are paying them anyway, send them back to work and produce! This is just a game. @TenNamesLater @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Keep up the fight sen. Lee! The American people are with you, thanks for standing up for us! God bless you!!!

@SenMikeLee -  Get your constituents real stance on the issues through transparent governing. #Accountability Citizenship
@SenMikeLee We know there's garbage in "clean" CR & Oscare so, you & other Republican Patriots need to post pics on here & copies on-line
@SenMikeLee Obama and Reid OWN the shutdown now.  Putting 'Barrycades' and guards around monuments where there were none before....
@SenMikeLee  Love the plan!  Keep passing them out of the House!
@SenMikeLee Praying for you.  Do not give up and neither will we.  This country is worth fighting for!
@SenMikeLee  @retireGOP the law is the law, so why is POTUS passing out exemptions from ACA 2 big biz?  Good work Sen Lee!  #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee Keep fighting! #WeThePeople are with you! #MakeDCListen
@fedupwithgovern The #Dems are #Losers in the #shutdown @SenMikeLee & @SenTedCruz are waking up American ppl. #ObamaSpite is helping too.
@SenMikeLee @elvincan2   Thank you, Sen Lee, for standing for the people! You are exactly what we need in D.C. !
@SenMikeLee 
I would rather endure a short term shutdown than live in a long term Obama socialist nation.  That is what is at stake!
@SenMikeLee Let's start playing the tape  of Sen Obama's speech against raising the debt ceiling. Early, loud, and often.
@SenMikeLee The Senate dems and O are looking very petty, keep on passing those bills, you are doing the right thing.
@SenMikeLee Dems have already negotiated and compromised. Why won't you tell the truth? Look in the mirror, Sir. #TeaPartyShutdown
@SenMikeLee Keep holding your head up, we the people appreciate your efforts...
@SenMikeLee why is it that when you want to negotiate you're called "hijacking" but when other side of aisle demands it's ok?
@SenMikeLee not surprised senate progressives are trying to make life as difficult as possible for regular Americans -we see it
@SenMikeLee @hughhewitt Wondering if the shutdown is a cover for two raids today and FBI one earlier in the week. More planned?
@SenMikeLee @hughhewitt New policy 2move forward.Never pass bill nobody's read.Do bills in small chunks&make Senate responsible4 every vote.
@SenMikeLee continue to stand, Senator...the ppl are behind you!
Good job so far, hold fast! American Patriots cannot cave to tyranny, nor negotiate w govt terrorists @SenMikeLee @Ledamaae
@SenMikeLee what happen to the great uniter. Over these last 5 yrs we have never been so divided  and so disrespectful to each other. Sad?
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  Thanks for your hard work! Tell the house, plead with the house to hold the line! #MakeCDListen
@SenMikeLee Keep it up! We are with you. Public opinion is shifting, it's different this time, we can WIN this. @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee Stop with the rhetoric, do your job, and GET THE GOVERNMENT WORKING!  #EndTheShutdownNow
@SenMikeLee . Obama and his deaf, dumb and blind follower , Harry Reid are destroying the fabric and heritage of this country ....

@SenMikeLee @baumsche Unless all of you so-called leaders are in cahoots with Obama, do something to stop his madness!  Why not already done
@SenMikeLee You are a waste of time and taxpayer money.  Stop this nonsense.
@SenMikeLee Mike stick with it were all behind you
@SenMikeLee Reid has not allowed a budget or negotiations on budget for 4 yrs. CR's r the problem!
@SenMikeLee tell your friends in the house to pass and send over a bill without strings. It's called a clean bill.
@SenMikeLee by pass resolutions do you mean send ransom notes? Making demands while holding USA hostage not the same as negotiating.
@SenMikeLee I've seen that hot mic video. Your "negotiate" is all polls & talking points. Please be REAL & do your job for Amer families
@SenMikeLee Stay strong, house of reps!
@SenMikeLee Stay the course, Senator. Thank you.
@SenMikeLee One of Teddies Teabag bitches is whining again. It's like you admitted today House has yet to bring ONE Senate CR up for vote.
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work for Americans!  I stand with you.

@SenMikeLee 18x GOP refused to conference on Budget..you are only fooling your rubes
@SenMikeLee Stand your ground!!!!!!

@SenMikeLee It's terrifying that people can't see through your charade. Informed people are taking note; GOP will suffer over the long term.
@SenMikeLee  Hold the line!  Dems didnt pass a budget for how many years?
@SenMikeLee HOLD THE LINE!!!!
@SenMikeLee @bartmckinley Time to #ImpeachHussein
@SenMikeLee Stop calling it a negotiation. Say it simple: The Senate refuses to pass legislation to keep the Government Open! Period!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for putting your necks on the line for us, like true Patriots you stand strong!
@SenMikeLee I know old guard #GOP trashing you, but the people are behind u & will be sending in replacements for those guys! #TNsen #tngop
@SenMikeLee We can all see the toll this has taken on you by the fatigue on your face. We're so sorry GOP elders corrupt. We have your back.

@SenMikeLee thank you for leading the charge in truly representing the will of the American people. You are appreciated!
@SenMikeLee why has no one moved to impeach Obama?
