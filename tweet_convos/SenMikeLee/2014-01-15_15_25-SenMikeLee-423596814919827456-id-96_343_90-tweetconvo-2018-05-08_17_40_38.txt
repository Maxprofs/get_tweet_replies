@SenMikeLee @SpotJSO oh word is that the defense appropriations bill?
@SenMikeLee @SpotJSO oh you're talking about $1tn over the next 20 years, not just this year. nevermind
@tinybaby @SenMikeLee so ppl who weren't old enough to vote for these idiots will be paying this off? Taxed without representation..? Yes.
@PepperLSnyder @SenMikeLee actually those people are represented by the congressmen and senators elected in their districts and states.
Why are you supportive of taxing ppl 20 yrs out? Wouldn't it make more sense to just spend what we need NOW? @tinybaby @SenMikeLee
@PepperLSnyder @SenMikeLee I don't think you understand how cost estimates for bills like the ACA work.
Sure I do. Spend what they need now, nothing more. @tinybaby @SenMikeLee
@PepperLSnyder @SenMikeLee How would you suggest we fund something that takes more than one year to do?
@StLNetworkGuru @shad39 @SenMikeLee Shouldnt the EPA be outlawing laws like this? How many trees were butchered for this? Wheres the justice
@SenMikeLee To write a bunch of garbage, except for the part that would solve the problem that would only take 1/50th of a reem @COCrowe
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea maybe you all should take your heads out of your asses and write no more than 2 page bills
@SenMikeLee @jsinacore007 AND 1trillion will be the tip of the iceberg.
@Longtails53 @SenMikeLee but nice that they're funding illegals' tax credits on the backs of Disable Vets true heroes! Ugh!
