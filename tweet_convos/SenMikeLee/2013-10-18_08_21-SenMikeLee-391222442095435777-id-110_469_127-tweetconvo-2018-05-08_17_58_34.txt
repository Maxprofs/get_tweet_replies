you should be held accountable for your treasonous actions toward this country, you asshole @SenMikeLee
@GRYKING @SenMikeLee your statement show you don't have a clue what treason is !

@GRYKING @SenMikeLee yes Obama and Harry Reid shutdown the govt, which was a good thing. To bad it was not closed down for longer.
@buddy_faro @SenMikeLee @rpollockDC The question really is how do we educate the public so this never happens again
@AppSame @buddy_faro @SenMikeLee @rpollockDC 
I have said this exact thing, its about the ability to communicate
@buddy_faro @conservativejfp @SenMikeLee @rpollockDC By having someone in power who can relate to them
@buddy_faro @conservativejfp @SenMikeLee @rpollockDC That is someone We must find someone we all must find we need another Reagan
@SenMikeLee @Prayformetoo If any of this happened under Bush the News would scream yell claim the world was about to end Obama gets a pass
@AppSame <--- so true, Obama is like teflon nothing sticks to him & it should ~  @SenMikeLee @Prayformetoo
@808AAlohalaniMc @SenMikeLee @Prayformetoo At this time we dont need that we must worry the Senate and House only TRUE Dirt on those we need
@AppSame <---what we need is to keep the House & take back the Senate in 2014, Obama would then be irrelevant ~ @SenMikeLee @Prayformetoo
@808AAlohalaniMc @AppSame @SenMikeLee Pray, pray, pray!
@Prayformetoo <---in additional to prayers it will take more involvement by all conservatives in their home states ~ @AppSame @SenMikeLee
@808AAlohalaniMc  Definitely!

@SenMikeLee @RightOnWeekly  #DEFUNDILLEGAL IMMIGRATION >> #NOON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION we do not want it
@SenMikeLee It seems to me that if the DOD is required to use contractors level 3 sys certs, the rest of gov should too.
@SenMikeLee <--- LOL for a minute there I mistook you for a liberal ~ yes, top mgmt in this admin in total disarray ~ @hrkbenowen #Obamacare

@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater Cut our losses and toss it out with the bath water.  President has tossed on billions to his buddies
@SenMikeLee OCare doomed to failure from the very beginning.
@SenMikeLee @kksheld This WH seems to have a policy, never admit anything and if it is wrong, ignore it & let the media cover for you.
@SenMikeLee @ronzel63 or, we've got to launch this website to find out everything that's wrong with it
@SenMikeLee @Pudingtane LMAO. What progammer in h is right mind would do this. You design, test, correct, retest, then implement. Not hard.
@SenMikeLee @DocWashburn Get the mantle of authority in place and let the details sort themselves out, or not.
@SenMikeLee - we support you in fighting ACA but unite GOP for more effective cuts in budget & debt ceiling. This is all vital for America!
@SenMikeLee @kksheld @rpollockDC while the Exchange rollout was incompetent, let's not lose focus of the underlying anti Freedom of the ACA
@SenMikeLee total incompetence

@SenMikeLee No one listening to you. Govern and cut the crap.
@SenMikeLee @torpedostatism The senator could have helped us. Instead, he just stood in the way. It’s our right to carp, his job to govern.
@GozoTweets @SenMikeLee Senators don't govern, they represent their State.
@torpedostatism @SenMikeLee My bad. I thought the Legislative Branch was part of governing. Just my misreading of the Constitution again.
@SenMikeLee what will you do when you are voted out of the Senate I hear you're poll numbers are crashing 20 pts down in a week.
@SenMikeLee @rpollockDC lol, also looks like the admin was too stupid to steel code that actually worked! #TGDN #tcot #teaparty

@SenMikeLee @jennybaggy didn't permit testing??? like they don't allow A's in class any more??
how the hell do you build it but not test it?
@SenMikeLee :)  The super large deductions make the Program look like a catastrophic care policy.
@SenMikeLee #Greta Obama does not want USA to know the higher costs but they do gather personal info & # of hits?
@SenMikeLee @InWithFlynn2014 And now we know,a big bucket of poo. So what do those of us who lost our ins and cant get onto the exchanges do

@SenMikeLee @hrkbenowen using ten year old technology a recipe for disaster. But when there is no budget, HHS can spend spend spend spend
@SenMikeLee  Thank you! Keep the pressure on.
@SenMikeLee This what you get when lawyers are in charge of everything, They think they are the Swiss Army knife of management tools.

@SenMikeLee isnt the Democrat response: "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?!?!?"
@SenMikeLee Obama is great at "Launching" sinking ships.
“@SenMikeLee: We've got to launch website to find out what is in it:  #Obamacare”

Perfect! Then have care denied to find what isn't in it!
@SenMikeLee It's probably too sickening to reveal! This is another slick delay to confuse the people.
@SenMikeLee @BretBaier too funny re: launch website to see what is in it

@SenMikeLee DC knows whats in it... And they don't want it!
@SenMikeLee That's what happens when you award a contract to an OBAMA DONOR who donated $340,000 to 2012 campaign, INCOMPETENCE!
