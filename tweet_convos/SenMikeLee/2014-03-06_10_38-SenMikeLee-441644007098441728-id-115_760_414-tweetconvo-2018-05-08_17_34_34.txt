@SenMikeLee @MercuryOneOC 
you mean pass amnesty for illegals,bailout corps, raise half a dozen taxes, and sign huge trillion $ budgets?
@HixsonT bringing the country back from the depressive brink of Carter #Reagan
@MercuryOneOC if we had a balanced budget amendment in 1980, none of what you say would have happened.
@HixsonT Reagan was in favor of a balanced budget amendment, link to his letter about it below.
@MercuryOneOC  Yes I remember. Back then they all said they were but nothing ever got pushed forward. Like illegal immigration now, all talk
@SenMikeLee @FreeSmart well, he talked like a conservative, but he sure didn't act like one.
@armedandjewish ;0) Unfortunately he's the best president conservatism can point to. Sad. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee the notion of Ronnie Reagan is a myth created by the Right. the reality is much less appealing. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/04/AR2011020403104.html …
@SenMikeLee which one. the real human reagan or the one you guys make up to hold as a saint?
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 I agree.....
@SenMikeLee @drginareghetti Not just "acting" like him, but governing like him.

@brenlogan82 @SenMikeLee Reagan is my hero too Brenda! That was a great proud time for our country!

@SenMikeLee @TheTweetSlinger  Actually it's time to act like Regan on steroids. Different time dif place. All world in trouble!#rebuild#mil!
@SenMikeLee @FreedomDisciple Reagan supported amnesty and assault weapon bans. Does that mean you will too? #justsaying
Reagan said Amnesty was the biggest mistake of his career. @fawfulfan @SenMikeLee
@FreedomDisciple @SenMikeLee false. Reagan never said that, nor is there a shred of evidence he believed it. http://dailycaller.com/2013/07/16/internet-myth-ronald-reagan-regretted-legalization/?onswipe_redirect=no …
@SenMikeLee Ronald Reagan wouldn't even recognize the conservative movement, and no that's not a dementia joke... How dare you.
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 amen!!!!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 AND the GOP MUST STICK TOGETHER. OTHERWISE the USA we all love will be LOST FOREVER.
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry Revive his ideals and revive the party, but the party has to come together first!
@SenMikeLee @Anna_Spicer2013 it's time America be told to grow up and become responsible for our problems and stop blaming like liberals do
@SenMikeLee @maggiejaehnig Thinking like Reagan would be a start.
@SenMikeLee @ellietilley ~~Very important concept. Start doing & stop talking ;-) Re:Reagan
@SenMikeLee But government grew under his watch. @Sam__Rice
@SenMikeLee Obama Admin releasing serious criminals becuz their country doesn't want them Please write law to correct loophole #LeeTownhall

@SenMikeLee AMEN!
@SenMikeLee @Patriotjan Do you know Reagen forced a 2nd appeal when DEA Judge (F.Young) ruled Marijuana was UNJUSTLY misclassified in 1968.
@SenMikeLee The problem Senator, is every time they do, they get shouted down by the establishment center.
@SenMikeLee Cruz/Lee or Lee/Cruz either way 2016. I'll camp out in advance to make sure a get a chance in line to vote
@SenMikeLee you forget sir that Reagan was not really "of" the GOP. He was more inspire of the GOP...
@SenMikeLee Agreed, tea party patriots are our only hope!
@SenMikeLee BINGO!!!
@SenMikeLee @ellietilley ~~Better yet, MORE doing & LESS talk :)  Re: Reagan

@SenMikeLee You said a mouthful! Hope enough people are awake & will vote in a way that will make people more accountable & act like Reagan
@SenMikeLee so…being assholes to people with AIDS, invading Caribbean countries and giving more money to the rich?
@SenMikeLee You are sooooooooooo right!
@SenMikeLee so true, thank you!
@SenMikeLee you're right! Let's ignore AIDS! Again!
MT @SenMikeLee: It’s time for the Republican Party to stop talking about Ronald Reagan and start acting like him. http://ow.ly/ujxeo 
@SenMikeLee Absolutely agree, Mike. We need action that people can believe in, that gives us real hope and a vision of a prosperous future
@SenMikeLee Sorry Sen  Lee, as Gov, Reagan tried to eliminate the 58 counties and implement regional government. Regionalism is Communism.
@SenMikeLee How true.  Having Chris Christie at CPAC to speak defeats this!
@SenMikeLee You mean to illegally sell weapons to Iran again?
@SenMikeLee I don't know, seems to me they're already doing a pretty good job of acting dead.
@SenMikeLee You mean raise taxes 11 times? Wow, that's surprising you're all for that.You best talk to your buddy Grover first...
@SenMikeLee YES!!
@SenMikeLee True that
@SenMikeLee How about saying "Mr. President" you can't change laws without going through Congress! Why is he not accountable for anything?
@SenMikeLee Amen,and let's start by getting rid  The Speaker and the Minority Leader
@SenMikeLee It's also time for the republican's  to take Lerners pension away if she refuses to answer questions!
@SenMikeLee So you're pro gun control, want to expand the debt, cut and run from terror attacks on marines, and sell arms to Iran?
@SenMikeLee Yes...and do the right thing for the American people. ..your bosses. ...stop being tools for the progressive socialist.
@SenMikeLee AMEN! Conservatism doesn't need redefining it needs  reviving. #RedNationRising #TeaParty #TCOT #CCOT
#Bravo @SenMikeLee: time for the Republican to stop talking about Ronald Reagan and start acting like him. http://ow.ly/ujxeo  #CPAC2014
@SenMikeLee I hope you're joking. He was.... just terrible.
@SenMikeLee Yes it is!
@SenMikeLee #teabagnosepickers
@elmergooch @SenMikeLee #teabagnosepickers Reagan was the Most Loved US President despite so much to report on the negative side. May he RIP
@SenMikeLee You mean increasing defense spending even more and taking us from the greatest creditor nation to the greatest debtor? Bad idea.
@SenMikeLee  Your the only Senator qualified to say that and really mean it --- # 1
