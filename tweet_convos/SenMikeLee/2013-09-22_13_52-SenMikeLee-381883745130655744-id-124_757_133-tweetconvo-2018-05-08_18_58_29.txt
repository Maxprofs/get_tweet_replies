@SenMikeLee Try to follow this. We had an election. One candidate supported ACA, one said Repeal It. The one who said Repeal It lost. OK?
@WayneASchneider the majority of Americans opposed it. The majority want it repealed. You didn't elect a dictator, ok? @SenMikeLee
@Mister_Gates @SenMikeLee Wrong. The majority of Americans oppose what the Republicans say is in the bill, but the GOP has lied to them.
@WayneASchneider there's no mandate then?  It's so great people don't have to be coerced into it?  The IRS isn't ENFORCING it?@SenMikeLee
@Mister_Gates @SenMikeLee What the GOP lies about is that the individual mandate was one of their ideas. They deny that.
@WayneASchneider Now YOU are lying. The GOP had NO hand in Obama care. Obama even said he opposed mandates.. A lie. @SenMikeLee
@Mister_Gates @SenMikeLee I never said that. I said the individual mandate was their idea. It's a main part of Romneycare.
@WayneASchneider doesn't matter who thought of it. American people hate it and want it gone. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee The only reason Americans say they don't like the ACA is because your party has been lying about it the whole time! Stop lying!
@WayneASchneider It doesn't matter that costs 4 avg famly of 4 2 go up ~ $7,450? Here's some news 4 u: http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/09/23/its-official-obamacare-will-increase-health-spending-by-7450-for-a-typical-family-of-four/ … @SenMikeLee
@CalFreedomMom @SenMikeLee This article will explain why that Forbes article is pure bullshit
@WayneASchneider I prefer 2 believe Forbes not 'ThinkPROGRESS.' It's bc of Progressives from both parties that US in trouble @SenMikeLee
@CalFreedomMom Enjoy a life in the darkness of RW lies. There are no progressives in today's Republican Party, thx 2 ppl like=> @SenMikeLee
@WayneASchneider LOL! Study history. It's taken more than 100 yrs of Progressivism to prevail. Conservatives purging GOP now. SenMikeLee
@CalFreedomMom Conservatism is all about Selfishness. Period. That is the underlying, driving force behind it. It can't succeed. @SenMikeLee
@WayneASchneider You and others have NO RIGHT to the fruits of MY labor. SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee is supporting what his constituency wants and now Americans. This is why we are a republic.
@DgailB @SenMikeLee Um, I'm a Utah constituent and I expressly disagree with Lee on EVERYTHING he does with Cruz!
@TraceyOaks @SenMikeLee He won the popular vote in your state.
@TraceyOaks @SenMikeLee I'll make you a deal. You can have Claire Mckaskill and I'll take Mike Lee ;)
@TraceyOaks @SenMikeLee Mo overwhelmingly voted against govt healthcare with a 67% vote. She turned around and supported it.
@TraceyOaks @SenMikeLee I have always said we can't fix anything until we have term limits.
@DgailB @SenMikeLee Completely agree!
@SenMikeLee @INHOC478 If you spent less on war over last three decades you could easily afford Obamacare! #war
@speakeezie @SenMikeLee also if your dear leader didn't increase welfare by 33% maybe we could afford his train wreck of ACA?
@INHOC478 @senmikelee Its the hypocrisy of the Republicans that is hard to stomach as though they were in no way responsible for the mess!
@speakeezie @SenMikeLee no one said that. But I'm sure it's Bushs fault right. He passed ACA? He doubled the debt to $17tril?
@SenMikeLee @Cats_lmbo EVEN DIMS UP 4 RE-ELECTION want it DELAYED! REPEAL&VACATE is the only AMERICAN thing to do to even TRY to Save USA
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea God Bless you Sen Lee & Cruz! Obama & Dem elite must be stopped from destroying our medical care & country!
@SenMikeLee obama care is here to stay get over it Dems will win back senate &house in 14,because of u blithering IDIOTS
@SenMikeLee @Cats_lmbo HOLD!, Yes - REPEAL AND VACATE that UNCONSTITUTIONAL and FRAUDULENT evil poison - or the nation DIES
@SenMikeLee @toby_dorena Thank you Senator Lee. I'm afraid the Senate Republicans don't have the courage to defund though.
@SenMikeLee GOP must hold, I will donate my last dime.
@winthrop_ann I love my wacko birds @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @SenRandPaul @TGowdySC

@SenMikeLee Bad idea. People need health care and other people need the jobs created by the AHC Act enrolling people in that health care.
@SenMikeLee Thank u 4 ur outstanding work in representing the majority of ur constituents, everyday Obamacare grows more & more  unpopular.
@SenMikeLee Demand a 60-vote threshold 4 any effort that wld add Obamacare funding back in2 the HCR. Fund the gov, do not fund Obamacare.
“@SenMikeLee: The American People Are Rallying Around the effort.” LOL in CNBC poll 19% support defunding. Can't get senate votes, get real.

@SenMikeLee @LdySis Lee...you wage a noble war...but your sense of how things play out further than a week or so are dumb. Let Dems OWN it.
@SenMikeLee @ronzel63 : ACA is garbage. The way to change it is to win House and Senate! This tilting at windmills is not good for Repubs.
@SenMikeLee @ronzel63 : Stop playing Don Quixote! Cannot win this way. Gov shut down will cost Repubs House and Senate. This is stupid!
@SenMikeLee @ConserValidity Careful not to delude yourself my friend. Look what runaway ego has done to #Obama
@SenMikeLee @ConserValidity Oh ya - Republicans get the credit?  NOT here. They had to dragged, kicking and screamingm by *Conservatives*.

@SenMikeLee WE the PEOPLE stand with you! At least someone in the Senate has integrity. God Bless you! #exemptamerica
@SenMikeLee Why don't you focus on getting rid of member & staff subsidies? NO ONE supports those except, perhaps, you guys.

@SenMikeLee Stay the course. America is behind you.#DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee before you defund ACA, defund your own health insurance first.
@SenMikeLee Why aren't The Repubs & Dems united against #Obamacare? The Majority of Americans don't want it! We'll remember in 2014/2016!
@SenMikeLee @EintheD1 Yes! Hold your ground! #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee The won't have background checks and many working out of civic orgs like Acorn. Crooks are going to steal identities like crazy!

@NavOneDallas I doubt it. The right is getting more extreme & older. They'll stay strong in some local races, but not nationally.
@pubic_slugs Your Doubts a good thing to have! We shall see if we continue on this path of Progressive Constitutional Demise! I have FAITH!
@NavOneDallas calm down, dude. The country will be fine either way.
@pubic_slugs I'm clam dude! Not raising my voice calling anyone names just have faith that true Americans want Smaller, less intrusive Gov.
@NavOneDallas I guess it depends on your definition of a "true American". I have no problem paying a little extra to help my fellow citizen.
@pubic_slugs Then walk down to ur local Church and Give! $17T in debt shud tell you the Government can manage the money! @RedNationRising
@RestoreAllTruth @SenMikeLee I have to agree with you. I lived in AZ & saw the state suffering because they were paying4 all of the illegals
@SenMikeLee Standing with you, Sen. Lee. Shutdown will be on the hands of Dems or Pres.
