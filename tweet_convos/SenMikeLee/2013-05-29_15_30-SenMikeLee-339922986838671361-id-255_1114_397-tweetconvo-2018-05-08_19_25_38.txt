@SenTedCruz : "This is one Cruz we want to catch fire and DOCK in Washington." (quote by @JohnQPublicJR ) #CruzToVictory #constitution
@MMangoz @SenTedCruz @JohnQPublicJR Is Obama constitutionally eligible 2 serve? http://po.st/nYZ1uY  LYING is his Game, Obama is his Name!
@tasteofaz @MMangoz @SenTedCruz A better question. Can our Constitution digest all of the poison it has been force fed by the Obama admin?
@JohnQPublicJR @tasteofaz @MMangoz @SenTedCruz We WILL take our rights back!!! http://irishjoeharrison.blogspot.com/2013/05/surviving-america-iv.html …
@IrishJoeHarriso @JohnQPublicJR @MMangoz In 2014 Dump 100% Dems, RINOs & 99% GOP 4TeaParty Citizen Legislators Who'll Swear 2Uphold US Const
@tasteofaz @JohnQPublicJR @MMangoz We wont make it to 2014
@IrishJoeHarriso @tasteofaz @MMangoz But God always has a remnant. That is why we must remain vigilant to uphold what is moral and true.
@JohnQPublicJR @tasteofaz @MMangoz As I wrote in a previous article. perhaps God is counting on us, maybe that is why we are here.
