@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen I'm sorry, I've been following on twitter.  Which part was 'the right thing'?
@Soledad_OBrien @SenMikeLee well let's see. The right thing? If obamacare is good enough to shove down our throats. The why the hell
@Txladywolf60 I'm sorry, my understanding is that obamacare didn't change--and no one expected it would. So what was 'right thing'?
Your understanding is incorrect. BO continues 2change it. Unaware of delay of employer mandate & exemptions?  @Soledad_OBrien @Txladywolf60
@0311firebase  what makes you make such a statement about @DocWashburn. How is he puppet? @VoteRivette @Soledad_OBrien @Txladywolf60
Inquiring minds want to know! @127bama @0311firebase @VoteRivette @Soledad_OBrien @Txladywolf60 :0)
@DocWashburn  silence. Guess that's the answer to that! Go figure! :) @0311firebase @VoteRivette @Soledad_OBrien @Txladywolf60
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen even if you made poor children go hungry and denied medicine for AIDS patients? Fuck you.
@paulhogarth @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Because those are only functions that our competent govt can do, right?
@TreyDyson @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen I don't see the private sector rushing to provide these services. Big Pharma rips off seniors & disabled
@paulhogarth @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Ever heard of charities, churches, or private citizens who love helping others? You should try it.
@TreyDyson @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Arianna Huffington used to agree w you. Then she volunteered @ private charities & realized we need govt
@paulhogarth @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen you have more faith in govt than I do. In all seriousness, if u don't already, volunteer. It's awesome
@TreyDyson @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Volunteering is awesome, I worked at nonprofits that help the poor. But they need govt funds to survive.
@paulhogarth @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Govt wastes .75 of every buck. So, get govt out of way, lower taxes, and Private citizens will help!!!
@SenMikeLee no matter what the morons say here. The true Americans back u 100%.
@Txladywolf60 @SenMikeLee They are Government Trolls hired by Soros! Don't argue! Just BLOCK!!
@Linda_Wray430 @SenMikeLee good idea Ms Linda
@SenMikeLee Thank you for listening to your constituents & not the nitwits.
@SenMikeLee @CalRWinn Don't play good cop, bad cop game saw enough of that played out in the LDS community & church
@SenMikeLee @808AAlohalaniMc Please, please keep it up, we Democrats are counting on you !!! We need you and Ted !!!
@Politics_n_Beer <---bite me, literally speaking of course ~  @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee It was. You& a handful of others were more focused on the American people NOT your political career. Thank you.
@SenMikeLee @bboneusa Davy Jim & Travis died at the Alamo.Not good for them.But Texas was born because of a fight they lost.
@gipper40Rick @SenMikeLee I don't feel the last fight was lost myself I think if  fight was lost rinos & liberals wouldn't be so up in arms
@SenMikeLee @MrsVerCrouse Thank you Mike for your courage.
@SenMikeLee Yes it is worth it. They have awakened a sleeping giant. Tea Party, Constitutionalist, are ready to vote the Rino and Dems out.
@SenMikeLee @808AAlohalaniMc it was worth it..Fight on!!!
@PatroitStrong61  ~ you bet,  most times doing what is best is not doing what is easy ~ @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @jdavid17 Rhsnk you Senator.  I'll definitely support your campaign
@SenMikeLee @capemaydolphin You forgot that the O started this dang Ocare..cld hav given it to those needing it..while letting us alone.
@SenMikeLee I only wish I felt as if any of you had. Congress continues to vote on bills and then read them.  And I thought you were lawyers
@SenMikeLee @LVNancy You know you're on the RIGHT TRACK WHEN THE TROLLS COME OUT IN DROVES! May I suggest INSTABLOCK?
@SenMikeLee @KCprinss
To continue to overspend is treason
Overspending is an attack on America.
Bankruptcy jeopardizes our National Security
.@PoetPatriot @SenMikeLee @KCprinss Obama blames Republicans for all his failures like Pakistan blames India for all it's terror acts.
@SenMikeLee @SSchwartz8 
Thank you.
@SenMikeLee @wivoutadoubt Yes sir it is
@SenMikeLee @Roy__Rogers democracy is centered on the assumption that voters will do the right thing as they see it. You go!
@SenMikeLee @CalRWinn Michigan Misconduct http://michiganmisconduct.blogspot.com/   then U need to confront those in your church who R inv in wrong doing
@SenMikeLee remember Immigration Laws arecthe law of land tell the others to just get over it! Lol
.@SenMikeLee Standard & Poor's says your little game cost the U.S. economy $24 Bill. "worth it"!?! @BuzzFeedBen
@jholston @SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen AW come on grow up ben.
@SenMikeLee @KCprinss
The American Way is to do the right thing.
#ThemDemLibs have to evaluate the advantages of doing the right thing.
@SenMikeLee 
If in Ur heart u feel u did the right thing. Ur a STATESMAN THANK U
@SenMikeLee @beastusa Of course it was.
@SenMikeLee Mike you flat kicked some arse. You made the Dems hold even tighter to ObamaCare and that my friend,  is going to haunt them.
@SenMikeLee in America the poorest are rich compared to poor in 3rd world, cell phones,  tv , food handed out everywhere. ..
@SenMikeLee @FredZeppelin12 I have to laugh when progressives ask "Was it worth it?" and watch this POTUS spend $7tril w/o saying a word
@SenMikeLee Throwing a tantrum and closing down the government because you lost an election was the right thing? You're deranged. #p2 #tcot
@BlueDuPage You sound deranged.
 If you think trying to keep overspending down is not right, then you are one of #ThemDemLibs.
 @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson Keep it up, the Tea Party will Prevail, it's Hammering Time, we've got you back!! God Bless America!
@SenMikeLee @capemaydolphin And...all those SIGNS & PLACKARDS ??? How they appeared in a flash..Amazing! Where they totally prepared?
@SenMikeLee the best way to help the poor is with prosperity not entitlements , cheapest and best health care is via competitive free market
@SenMikeLee ignore any of these ignorant idiot trolls, Thank you for standing up for what is right, our country was founded despite the odds
@SenMikeLee Yes, always do and stand up for the right thing even if you lose. If you dont, then you become just another wishy washy nobody
@SenMikeLee good job Mike keep fighting. #ObamaCareFailureToLaunch #teaparty #Teapartynation
@SenMikeLee I notice all the hateful comments from the 47%....tired of being baby mama to UNGRATEFUL THEIVES #MakeDCListen #CutTheCreditCard
@suzanrosanadana @SenMikeLee "47%" Ha! That's what GOP deserves!
@SenMikeLee next time ask the media if their soul waa worth tearing down the America & propping up a DICKtator? #MakeDCListen #DefundTheGOP
@SenMikeLee @Mariacka I don't understand that people don't get this.  Most of us are raised to do the right thing.

@SenMikeLee @sgpope19 Sen. Lee, U are a true American HERO! Thank U so much for standing by your convictions & with the people. Stay true!
If you are serious, and I think you are, then always stand your ground and be loud.  Very loud.@SenMikeLee @hollyR_J_N
@SenMikeLee @hollyR_J_N The right is the only thing worth doing. All else in life is (to paraphrase) "Sound and Fury signifying nothing".
@SenMikeLee that's why conservatives keep losing. they will never stop till 100% total govt and 100% total equal poverty.
@SenMikeLee @hollyR_J_N  TY so much.
@SenMikeLee @hollyR_J_N Then why didn't you object to the fast tracking of this BS bill?
@SenMikeLee good. Never quit
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler Absolutely!
.@SenMikeLee You didn't do the right thing. You licked #tealiban boot at the expense of the People. u r a moron. #vote
@Catballou @brighteyedjaymi @SenMikeLee A Party Gone Mad – Today’s Republicans are Yesterday’s Fascists http://www.politicususa.com/2013/08/14/party-mad-todays-republicans-yesterdays-fascists.html … …
@SenMikeLee good for you!!
@SenMikeLee Media?  You mean 'obama's media'...ignore them, we thank you for standing with us!
@SenMikeLee 
To do the right thing is the sign of a statesman not a politician
@SenMikeLee Always fight to do the right thing! The American people should know where you stand.
@SenMikeLee If we had more like you America would have won tonight instead we all lost The media is so corrupt cannot say we have free press
@SenMikeLee How would they know, they have never done the rt thing
@SenMikeLee @sheila14all 2 Kings 6
"Don't be afraid," the prophet answered. "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
@SenMikeLee @sheila14all I see all of the little Bolsheviks are trolling your tweet Sen Lee. Stand firm against Barry's Obammycare
@SenMikeLee @sheila14all We must stamp out Obamacare law. The #msm was successful in blaming Conservatives. We the People know the truth!
@SenMikeLee thank you.
@SenMikeLee Thank you, Sir!
@SenMikeLee what is the " right thing " anymore when millions are being crushed by Dem policies?? a little slower death? @theabundantgift
@SenMikeLee @XHEMILA2011 You're a good man Senator and what you have been doing will not be forgotten!
@SenMikeLee @MIRestoration I like your upbeat, positive attitude.  We will live to fight another day, but it still hurts and stings tonight
@SenMikeLee @theabundantgift Come back with answer in March of 14.
@SenMikeLee the ppl here condenming u dont live in your district and aren't even #AmericanCitizens
@SenMikeLee it is always easier to do nothing. That is why we have a 17 trillion dollar deficit.
@SenMikeLee God bless you and Senator Cruz for being the voice of the American people in DC. We have not yet begun to fight.
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator. Keep it up. God bless.
@SenMikeLee the ppl that are against u either dont know the liberties theyr giving away or r socialists @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee @griffisk Senator Lee.. I'd say to them.. Your question implies this fight is over.. its not.
@SenMikeLee @LVNancy Cannot wait for these GOVERNMENT TROLLS TO PAY FOR OBAMACARE! OUCH!
It's about time that someone stood for US and spoke on our behalf #MakeDCListen @Linda_Wray430 @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #DefundIt #ACAsucks!
@LVNancy @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I think #DefundIt is an impossibility!I think THE LAW willBVictimOfItsOwnDestruction!SiteNeeds2BupNrunning
Both @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee on @seanhannity "if Senate Republicans had united, outcome would be different" @Linda_Wray430 #TrainWreck
@SenMikeLee Thank you for trying Sir.  I'm done with Republicans now in spite of your efforts.
@senmikelee It saddens me that you feel the loss in GDP was "worth" it when you all had YEARS to go about it he right way.
@SenMikeLee @MarianCantwellF Than why are the #GOP members in the House rolling over tonight? Why did some roll over in the #senatedeal?
@SenMikeLee @LVNancy Go Mike Lee!!!
@SenMikeLee I thank you for taking the stand and all the crap that came along with it.  You have my respect and appreciation
@SenMikeLee your type of extremism is insidious. Do u live on the moon?
some1 check ti see if siddhartha mahanta is a us citizen "Keep Up The Good Work @SenMikeLee #DefendLiberties
@SenMikeLee  It certainly was and is, sir.  We will continue to stand with you; we fully support your virtuous efforts. Thank you. So much.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing for the Constitution.
Yes @SenMikeLee it was worth it! You listened and stood for us! Worth it just to know where we stand with the @gop #tgdn
@SenMikeLee correct! If only u had done the right thing.......
@SenMikeLee  Thank you for standing strong. We are with you. Please keep fighting to save us from Obamacare. Keep up the good fight.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen you did NOT do the right thing. You committed sedition & treason, asshole.
@SenMikeLee yes..fighting for our ideals is definitely the right thing!
“@SenMikeLee: The media keeps asking, was it worth it?  My answer is that it is always worth it to do the right thing:" you sir are nuts
@SenMikeLee....RMFE.
@SenMikeLee I like you! Don't say this deal is the right thing!
@SenMikeLee Yes, thank you. At least we know there are some willing to fight for America.
@SenMikeLee @dhrxsol1234 Right on, Mike!  Stand for Truth and Values and don't let up. By 2014 let's all work 2 elect more like you & Cruz.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Well, of course it is, but when you do it in such a badly planned and delivered manner, then no, it's not worth it.
@SenMikeLee Since when is standing on principles and honoring the promises made to constituents a bad thing?
Thanks for being stand up, walk/talk trusted leader .@SenMikeLee  short term not same as long term, trust process and carry on. With you sir
Idea that we've abdicated doing what's right depending on what other guy does, or polls, or "brands" hurts USA.@SenMikeLee @Morlen4Distrct1
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing for what is right. People seemed to have forgotten that integrity matters.
@SenMikeLee what is the saying abt evil prevailing when good men do nothing?!  @jetx86
@SenMikeLee @SaltyBlackBroad Soldiers dive on grenades to save their friends not to make it's danger less visible.
@SenMikeLee mike thank you for speaking up. We really need more like you to save this country from the fools that will promise anything
@SenMikeLee so when are you going to start doing the right thing?
@SenMikeLee @Bipolarsmom2 It don't do no good if you don't stick to it until the end, two weeks, just to hurt your cause., #Sickening
@SenMikeLee I, Doreen Laird, wish that I lived in Utah rather than Arizona.  I appreciate your intelligence.
@SenMikeLee STFU. Next time don't collect ur own fucking paycheck while u grandstand. Ur full of shit
@SenMikeLee @Jiminmodesto thank you for standing for us!
@SenMikeLee Sen.Lee, Thank you.You fought the good fight.We may have lost the battle,but we will not lose the WAR.Keep #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee your doing what u said you would do.  Your standing on what u ran on Obama said healthcare would go down by 2500$ #obamalied
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up. We will prevail. Stay strong.
“@SenMikeLee: The media keeps asking, was it worth it?  My answer is that it is always worth it to do the right thing: yes Sir it was
@SenMikeLee TY Sir for standing with the American people! We appreciate all you tried to do! Keep fighting! We stand with you!
@SenMikeLee Thank you. You, and your efforts, are much appreciated.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen  Of course the human beings who were hurt by the shut down might feel a little differently.
@SenMikeLee you and your partner-in-crime @SenTedCruz owe the taxpayers $24billion for your quixotic quest. Pay up!
@SenMikeLee You showed us there are adults in Washington, not just 2 year olds throwing a tantrum bc they can't have everything they want
.@SenMikeLee intentionally hurting people is NEVER "the right thing", especially when you're just grandstanding.
@SenMikeLee You are truly a fool. I hope your voters recognize that.
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek and you did the right thing this evening.  I will make sure ppl remember for your reelection.
@deanmeek I agree, thank you @SenMikeLee for standing up for #American and against a #tyrannical #POTUS
@jimcc66 @reshas @deanmeek @SenMikeLee  Well at least Lee didn't make my #RepublicanShitList today.
@SenMikeLee the American people thank you. It is worth it
@SenMikeLee Absolutely it was the right thing!
@SenMikeLee Putting your political career ahead of party and Country is not right.
@SenMikeLee Maybe you should try doing the RIGHT THING. We want ACA -- not you. U R destructive and ignorant. Go mess up Russia or someplace
@SenMikeLee Yes, because furloughing 400,000+ federal workers and draining $24B from the economy with basically nothing in return is "right"
Issue is ur def. of "right" MT:@SenMikeLee:media keeps asking, was it worth it?My answer is that it is always worth it to do the right thing
@SenMikeLee You took ~.5% from GDP, hurt 300M people, tarnished our reputation and our monetary system. All for show. Done the same w/ vote
@SenMikeLee But you were doing the wrong thing.
@SenMikeLee You mean it was worth it for you to cripple your country just to prove that you didn't like losing the election #TeaPartyFail
@SenMikeLee and we have a fundamental disagreement about what is the "right thing."
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen U live in a fantasy world in UR own mind. U r out of touch with the people of this country. Repubs have hurt us all
.@SenMikeLee Costing the economy $24 billion and trying to deprive my best friend of health care is the right thing? Unbelievable.
@4lgsgood @SenMikeLee your best friend wont be able to afford this affordable healthcare.
.@SenMikeLee @kasie You need to take a step back, look at the damage your stunt caused to real people, and apologize. Then resign.
@SenMikeLee The media doesn't comprehend political principle, only political expediency.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Yeah, you're a real hero. /s
@SenMikeLee Amen, Brother!
@SenMikeLee a lot of support for you in our household. Good on you sir
@SenMikeLee It isn't over until America collapses under it own borrowing, taxing and spending weight. There will be no debate when it falls.
@SenMikeLee U need to keep the fight going or this country will be lost, if not already.
@SenMikeLee Your awesome Mike. Stay strong. @sentedcruz #letgetbacktobeingamerica
@SenMikeLee No body likes you!
@SenMikeLee Absolutely!  Never quit/give up.  We appreciate your stand 4 Americans & Constitution. We support  u, @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul!
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen U voted 2 fund the farm bill that U benefit from personally,but no funding for Teen moms/babies, special needs kids
@SenMikeLee @kasie again polls say u were wrong it is hard 4 u understand u freakin moron that the way u went about it was STUPID!!!
@SenMikeLee It's always worth it leaving working folks without child care @HeadStartgov or infants without formula #WIC #letsinflicktpain
@SenMikeLee God Bless u and all conservatives!
Definition of "right" is the problem. Cloak yourself in service if you need to but you did it for yourself, ego & ideology, @SenMikeLee.#hcr
@SenMikeLee You mean wasting $24 Billion on your bone headed plan to #shutdown the government? #utpol
@SenMikeLee #StandFirm to #MakeDCListen it's  #HarryReidsShutdown America #StandWithCruz  & those who uphold their Oath. Yes, it's worth it!
@SenMikeLee Enjoy your Obamacare liberals. Hope it was worth it.
@SenMikeLee Agreed, always right to do the right thing.  House should STILL REJECT this offer.  We're not there yet. #tcot #FairnessForAll
@JohnWilson So, have you signed up for your ObamaCare yet?
@SenMikeLee tell that to all the government contractors who won't get paid for your little stunt, you pompous ass.
@SenMikeLee Amen!!! Thank you, Senator Lee!!!
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen You've proven to America you're incapable of figuring out the right thing to do.
@SenMikeLee Your the Man Mike. If the idiots above me gave a crap about spending they would have been with you too.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen 

"The right thing" is denying millions of Americans access to healthcare. Gotcha.
@SenMikeLee Right thing? American people by huge majority don't think your tactics were the "right thing". Your bubble is full of poison.
@SenMikeLee is it annoying to be Cruz's useless Lindsey Graham or r u OK with it
@pareene @SenMikeLee lol... awesome
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen When an overwhelming majority of US citizens don't think it was the right thing does  that not give you pause?
@SenMikeLee Obama closed the govt and the Senate too by not voting on the passed spending bills!
@SenMikeLee You are really deluded. Or lying. No rational person can believe what you just said.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen As with most atrocious behavior, misunderstanding what the right thing is led you down a misguided path.
@SenMikeLee true!
“@SenMikeLee: media keeps asking, was it worth it? My answer is that it is always worth it to do the right thing” even if it's 2 weeks late
Yes it it! Thank u for fighting tor us little people against the elitest lib's @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Yes, it was absolutely worth it. Great job! The US is broke, $17 trillion in debt. #Obamacare will make it much worse.
@SenMikeLee Amen. This is the point. Not political gimmicks based on polling data, but sticking to principles.
@SenMikeLee you are an imbecile and I can't wait until I can vote you out of office!
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen  U think U did the right thing? For whom? What about the millions of people U screwed out of a nutritious meal?
@SenMikeLee AMEN!!!!!! TYVM 4 saying that. ANYONE who says it wasn't worth it should hang their head in shame. What r they doing in DC then?
@SenMikeLee It was worth it! Our family from Wisconsin supports you.
@SenMikeLee YES right thing, still need to hold out!!
@SenMikeLee The blanket of self-delusion is warm, indeed.
@SenMikeLee how many lost jobs because of you? How much did it impact economy? More importantly, how much $$ did you raise? You are a fraud.
@SenMikeLee You furloughed thousands of workers in your state. Sending the unemployment rate up 3 times higher than normal, and for what?
@SenMikeLee Thank you, Sir. Keep fighting for America!
@SenMikeLee Then why didnt you Mr. Lee?
@SenMikeLee @kasie 24 billion dollars worth it? So much for being fiscally responsible.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen U r FUCKIN 4real man go away
@SenMikeLee God Bless you for having integrity loyalty morals & conviction to do what's right!
#tcot #gop #ObamasWarOnAmerica #ObamacareFail
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen Ok...when are you guys going to reimburse the country the $24B this stunt cost us? #GOP #Democrats #shutdown
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen You're an idiot. People went w/o paychecks & you don't have enough shame to be sorry or at least pretend.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen slink back to your hole Lee, you shame our nation.
@SenMikeLee I agree. Keep up the fight.
@SenMikeLee The right thing for who? Not the nation! Just your ideological followers. The minority should never run our nation.
.@SenMikeLee I thank you for trying. If Dems get #amnesty, too, the country will collapse. At least you'll get to say "I told you so".
@SenMikeLee Thank U & Ted Cruz 4 fighting 2 do the right thing. You, Ted, Sarah Palin & Rand Paul R the young fighters we need. God Bless U
@SenMikeLee @marklevinshow reveals total constitutional betrayal of this bill.
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen so in other words "No"
@SenMikeLee Damaging the economy and ruining the reputation of the US and hurting its citizens is not the right thing
@SenMikeLee @BuzzFeedBen I just threw up in my mouth a little...thanks Senator. #shutdown
