@SenMikeLee Why do GOP Presidents create deficits, and then blame DEMs? is this an honesty issue, or sanity? 
#shutdown the GOP for God.
@jonhartmannjazz @SenMikeLee All presidents add to deficits, this one just snowballs the process and is too arrogant to compromise for US.
@Artemis7299 @SenMikeLee do you mean "is too arrogant" for a Black Man?
@jonhartmannjazz @Artemis7299 @SenMikeLee Half-black Half-white PETULANT CHILD would be more accurate.
@Maxicat @Artemis7299 @SenMikeLee that tweet was very unfortunate. you sound like something of a Racist Dog. enjoy INSTABLOK  3000
@jonhartmannjazz @Maxicat @SenMikeLee HAHA, I have mixed family, and my own is blended. So typical to pull the #racecard when empty-handed.
@Moni53825245 @Artemis7299 @jonhartmannjazz @Maxicat @SenMikeLee Wow, look how grown up you are! I'm impressed with your vocabulary.
@SenMikeLee See how #Democrats are acting? They're panicking. You can win #Republicans; #DontBlink #DontCave, #GOP #DefundIt #StandWithLee
@Ron_GriffithsJr @SenMikeLee Panic among Democrats?..no, it's Glee..joy, happiness, giddiness.
@jonhartmannjazz @Ron_GriffithsJr @SenMikeLee good joke! thanks for making me :-)
@PeggiD Reagan raised the debt 190%, W raised it 86%..do you need glasses or a hearing aid?
@jonhartmannjazz Obama: Deficit falling fastest in 60 yrs. liar liar pants on fire! #ReduceDeficit http://www.factcheck.org/2013/08/deficits-falling-from-way-up/ … …
@SenMikeLee Army Wife here, 28 years in service and being treated like garbage by #HarryReidsShutdown. Not enough to abolish our Tricare.
@Moni53825245 @SenMikeLee True enough. My hubs is owed a very sizeable chunk of change, being held hostage by #HarryReid & friends. Sick.
@SenMikeLee Do it my way, or the highway, do we have a president or a dictator ? Stand firm
@SenMikeLee @Frances_D and if Vegas took money on who blinks first, my money would be on GOP blinking first and last
@Cracka_Gavin @SenMikeLee I'm not taking that bet. The GOP's motto has been "Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory" for years.
@Frances_D @SenMikeLee Used to be. I don't believe it is any longer. Which is why we have Obamacare, a massive deficit & Obama as President
@SenMikeLee  treason unconstitutional
@trixienovel @ladynra1 @SenMikeLee easier to prove fraud just prove Obama papers fraudulent and harmed people with his presidency.
@zanografix @ladynra1 @SenMikeLee hang him with treason for Begahzi 4 never forget Bengahzi
@trixienovel @ladynra1 @SenMikeLee No I want him naked in a jail cell like that one Japanese PM crime defrauding America
@zanografix @trixienovel @ladynra1 @SenMikeLee You have some rather demented fetishes
@SenMikeLee  PATHETIC RW talking points...Get a grip A-H. Lets get the FACTS straight!
@SenMikeLee @valuepointorg In that case, shut down the Capital Police. Shut down all the perks they enjoy. Shut down the remaining 83%!
@SenMikeLee @POTUS7 Democrats are communist dirt bags. Back in the day they would all be questioned by the FBI.
@SenMikeLee @schwingcat truly disgraceful shame on the democrats
@SenMikeLee YOU DO NOT REPRESENT ME!  and yes, i live in UT
@SenMikeLee Hang in there boomer the game is on
@SenMikeLee Shame on you for trying to mislead people. You're betting a lot on our ignorance.
@SenMikeLee Just like you all made it clear that you are a bunch of childish jackasses. Senators gossiping on Twitter. Real mature.
@SenMikeLee @VoteRivette Another sign of Senate Dems, disregard for the men who have offered up their lives to protect their sorry Butts!
@SenMikeLee What's clear is that you are an extortionist and a liar. You have no place in our society much less our government. #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee OH stop acting like an ass. Amer Public is not stupid. Know sen cr would pass house if Bonner put up & would immed open all govt
@SenMikeLee @DebWilliams57  STAND YOUR GROUND!
@SenMikeLee @schwingcat Obviously a tit for a tat.....but somehow this seems vindictive and obtuse.
@SenMikeLee 
 I think your doing the right thing, keep the fight and educate the president of the rules of engagement.....
@SenMikeLee The president is a petulant child. He will never waiver. He's taking all the toys from everyone. It's his way or nothing
@SenMikeLee it's you who won't fund va benefits because you won't fund the affordable care act. Why is this difficult. #84043
@SenMikeLee Hang tough, stay strong, read the story of Moses for courage!  You and #SenTedCruz are doing the right thing
@SenMikeLee  Now Senate Dems shove #Obamacare down throats of WETHEPEOPLE all over again, this time through extortion #HarryReidsShutdown
.@SenMikeLee Excuse me but you're only fooling yourself & low info voters who watch Fox "news" #GOP is flailing.Stop hurting American people
Sure Lee, you'll fund everything piecemeal and then leave out #Obamacare - @BarackObama and @SenatorReid are not dumb - YOU ARE @SenMikeLee
.@SenMikeLee  Keep up the fight for fairness and #fiscal balance @Norsu2 #MakeDCListen #DontFund obamacare
@SenMikeLee Traitors to our military
@SenMikeLee @tgradous Dems have held GOP hostage every time they have stood 4Helping ALL USA 23Mill Out of work non Gov EmployeeNOW STANDING
@SenMikeLee @Bonacker69 Was commons sense and decency gone out the window for the Dems?
@SimmonsBart @SenMikeLee @Bonacker69 Did those veterans only fight for Republicans?
Bingo!...Great point. 
“@friscoprolifer: @SimmonsBart @SenMikeLee @Bonacker69 Did those veterans only fight for Republicans?”
@SenMikeLee Patriots VOW, often we WOW however, we will NEVER bow! STAND FIRM & present ONE BILL at a time as needed to re-open Gov up.

@SenMikeLee Sen Lee, I want to see that all day long ! I can't wait to see the back lash if those brain dead Dems do that. Make my day !
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 Isnt it tough dealing with incompetents?
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 This is a record of the lengths 2which DEMS will go2 2protect Obamacare - The ppl will remember this come election time.

@SenMikeLee @mundyspeaks I'm a vet.... STAND STRONG ! DO NOT CAVE,! WE CAN ENDURE!! #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee The same ones who attacked Newt are attacking you now, same tired DC power game; they need to go. Stay strong, we are with you!
@SenMikeLee you're a pathetic excuse for an American. You're a fascist bent on destroying any opportunity for poor of middle class
@SenMikeLee So your political actions caused the shutdown.    #ShutdownTheGop
@SenMikeLee the  only reason why you Tea Party members dont likeObama is because he is black.. look at all those good all boys
@SenMikeLee you are another piece of crap that becuse of you I have no money to pay my bills,
@SenMikeLee Stealing from those that earned it to force socialism on people that don't want it
Lies and Calumny! RT @minigoon94: @SenMikeLee Stealing from those that earned it to force socialism on people that don't want it
@SenMikeLee Obama and Reid are already turning on their own voters by closing down MLK Memorial.
@SenMikeLee yes!! Hold the line
@SenMikeLee @OCAmericans WHAT A HORDE OF IGNORANT ELITE DESPOTS, THEY R NOT AMERICAS PARENT. THEY HAVE NO SOLUTIONS, SPANK THEM
@SenMikeLee Stay strong Sir. They are like toddlers having a tantrum. Give in and they'll just get worse.
@SenMikeLee The V.A has already been punishing our veterans & holding their pay calling it a "back log". Liberals hate our military #tcot
@SenMikeLee @LovToRideMyTrek Hang in there. It looks 2 most of us that Obama is coming unhinged. Give a man enough rope 2 hang himself with
@FedUpJoe @SenMikeLee don't give up the fight there are more on your side than u know. If  media did their job right admin would have caved
@SenMikeLee only reason regular orderbisnt used is dems know that reg order makes defunding O-Care possible. GOP has fallen into CR trap.
@SenMikeLee I am a Democrat and I say don't give up the fight, I support Republican values, will be switching parties soon.
@SenMikeLee you are delusional
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  keep fighting! #WeThePeople will stand!
@SenMikeLee  Stand strong Republicans obamas gestapo tactics are starting to wake the people up
@SenMikeLee @gardenofthegods Right? The Party that - supposedly - cares about people. #tcot #lnyhbt
@SenMikeLee Nonsense as the ACA is already funded.
@SenMikeLee  Democrats are now holding vets hostage!!!.Keep fighting those Democrats and Obamacare,the democrats are feeling the pressure.
@SenMikeLee Stand the Course! Great Job on Hannity! The American Ppl know you are fighting for them! Thank You 
“@SenMikeLee: Today Senate Democrats made it clear that unless we fund #Obamacare, they won't fund veterans' benefits: #occupytheparks #vets
@SenMikeLee  Don't buy obamacare or pay penalty they can do nothing no criminal sanctions, no ability to levy a bank account or do seizures.
@SenMikeLee That's on them.  Dems and Repubs debated veteran benefits in the past.  But the Dems did not allow debate with ANYONE on Ocare.
@SenMikeLee thanks for fighting the fight for us. You are a patriot
@SenMikeLee @gailtalk The Dems are mad because they can't get a Clean CR & get carte blanc to spend as they please
@SenMikeLee SO SAD POTUS AND LEFT REID PIGLOSI SCHUMER THE WHOLE BUNCH ARE A DISGRACE WIRING SHUT FENCE WW2 MEMORIAL.SHOULD BE TRIED TREASON
@SenMikeLee #DontBlink #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee it's like a bunch of vindictive teenagers with no common sense run our country. #firecongress
.@SenMikeLee  Thats sad! PLEASE keep fighting for Americans that want to be treated FAIR @Lambjrstephen #MakeDCListen @Senate_GOPs #gop
@SenMikeLee A clip from FOXNews doesn't help your case
@SenMikeLee @coff33loveit Because they don’t care about what the people want. Why not have a public vote on ACA?
He would never.. Already looks weak! .@B_radHilton .@SenMikeLee
@coff33loveit @SenMikeLee He knows the people would shoot it down. If that happened, he may as well move out of the WH.
@SenMikeLee @BlessedintheUSA Remember #America, it's @SenatorReid who caused this #shutdown! The @GOP is doing everything it can to help us!
@SenMikeLee  the dumb dems r starting to feel the pressure don't give in keep passing single funding bills  Harry is feeling the heat
@SenMikeLee Yup, that's right.  You don't get to get to pick & choose.  Pass a clean CR & pay the Capitol Police & 800,000 federal workers.
You are a failure. At running the country. At paying your mortgage. At honesty.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee They just keep digging the hole deeper with their temper tantrums.  Stay strong.
@SenMikeLee Hold the line! Don't give in and keep fighting!
@SenMikeLee Senator, please help the Speaker stay strong.
@SenMikeLee @camobell24 Seems 2 me that Obama & Reid r INVITING a rebellion not seen in USA since 1775. #ORPUW
@SenMikeLee Which is reason we need 2 call, write or visit local offices, our Dem senators, 2 tell them 2 AT LEAST support bipartisan bills!
@SenMikeLee @camobell24 Then if the Dems take away Vet's funding, Perhaps they better prepared 4 vet's descending on DC #ORPUW #STANDFIRM
@SenMikeLee Page 1 of the Obamacrat playbook.
@SenMikeLee  Stop holding our government hostage! The people voted FOR #Obamacare and the republicans are hurting the USA #EnoughAlready
@SenMikeLee @repsandylevin @SenCarlLevin @StabenowPress Guess the congress people from Michigan missed this, so...
@SenMikeLee Because they are heartless souls.I get them totally.Wolves in sheeps clothing....#Beware
@SenMikeLee  I am one American that is sick of the Dems lying, watching C Span Dem Claim they have cut debt in half, big lie. #demsshutdown
@SenMikeLee @doug_dingman Wow. Who's holding who hostage??
@SenMikeLee @barbie124h Dems want to take care of poor - but not take care of Vets. Yeah -that seems about right. @marklevinshow @ShareThis
@robtdfischl @SenMikeLee @marklevinshow @ShareThis Not taking care of anyone but themselves is more accurate.
.@SenMikeLee so Senate Dems, Reid, Obama holding nation hostage to protect massive job destroying govt boondoggle? #HarryReidsShutdown
@SenMikeLee wondering if u have the k hoons to ask why muslims got an exemption from aca.thats 4 mill americans exempt thanks.no surrender
@SenMikeLee Could this statement be any more disingenuous? Stop using veterans for your own political ends.
@SenMikeLee Or you could pass a clean CR and a clean Debt Limit.
@SenMikeLee @doug_dingman   I am a vet.Do not give in to these goons.
@SenMikeLee the GOP are on a sucide mission. Have lost all sense of reality.
@SenMikeLee Why won't @SpeakerBoehner just allow an up-or-down vote on a clean CR?
@SenMikeLee @CottonMandyGram According to Obama at the first of the week ACA was already funded.
@SenMikeLee I guess they are now taking ACTUAL hostages: veterans, people wanting to see natl landmarks,etc. Really?
@SenMikeLee yall are holding the country hostage to prevent millions from receiving health care. Nice editing. Yall are idiots
@SenMikeLee Senate Dems are right while Tea Party is becoming more delusional. Will people reelect you knowing your Tea Party extreme views?
@SenMikeLee this will backfire on progressives - only blacks will support on basis of color
@SenMikeLee I'm looking forward to you getting bounced at the nominating convention just like Bob Bennett was.
@SenMikeLee Senator Lee This point needs to be made: Obamacare v. Vet's $$. Dingy Harry made the choice and vets lost. You can win!
@SenMikeLee How about if both corrupt parties quit borrowing & wasting 100s of BILLIONS of $ on foreign aid & world policing ?
USA $ for USA
@SenMikeLee No, they made it clear they don't 'negotiate' with guns to their heads. #GOPshutdown #JustVote
@SenMikeLee Only one front in the Democrat's #WarOnVets stop block access to monuments and grave yards too, Children. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up for us. We are trying to #MakeDClisten. We want to #defundobamacare and stop all the craziness.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for working so hard to stop obamacare, my prayers are with you!
@SenMikeLee #DontBlink they are wrong we are right! #DefundObamacare stand strong! America is at stake! Believe it!
“@SenMikeLee: Today Senate Dems made it clear that unless we fund #Obamacare, they won't fund veterans' benefits: http://youtu.be/KLNNt0k0yyk ”
@SenMikeLee They are full of hot air threats.  Let  them go against the veterans and they will have a fight on their hands.
@SenMikeLee Read the polls...Loser.
@SenMikeLee The Democrats bring dishonor to those who put their all on the line! All I can harshly say about them is, the Dems are cowards!
@SenMikeLee #DontBend #RecallsStarting
@SenMikeLee  Sounds like "extortion" to me
@SenMikeLee don't cave. Don't back down. We can take it. The military vets are strong and can endure!
@SenMikeLee You have made it equally clear that unless they defund the #ACA, you will not fund the full government. GOP tied $ to agenda.
@SenMikeLee Or another way of saying it is YOU won't pass a clean CR. Please end this. Please.
@SenMikeLee Terrible!!!
@SenMikeLee @GOP #DontBlink #ObamaSpitesVets #ObamaShutDown
@SenMikeLee You have lost your mind that's not even close to what was said.Open your ears.Stop playing your stupid games
@SenMikeLee Not to worry Senator, the American people who actually work and pay taxes will remember who they are in 2014 and beyond.
@SenMikeLee Damned right.  Now go hug a #SlabOfStone #CryBaby #GOPShutdown #BoehnerShutdown
@SenMikeLee Thank you for all that you are doing, don't back down.
@SenMikeLee They're holding our veterans ransom for their twisted agenda to push a failed piece of legislation.
MT “@SenMikeLee: Today Senate Democrats made it clear that unless we fund #Obamacare, they won't fund veterans' benefits."
@SenMikeLee Obamacare is already funded. You are the one trying to defund it. Educate yourself on cause and effect.
@SenMikeLee Obamacare is already funded you jackass!  It's a decided LAW! Reopen the damn gov't.
@SenMikeLee Time to march on Washington - November 1st
@SenMikeLee sounds like extortion to me.
