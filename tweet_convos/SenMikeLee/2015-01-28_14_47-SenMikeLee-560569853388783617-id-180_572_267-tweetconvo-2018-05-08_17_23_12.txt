@livingstranger @senmikelee "STUCK in the 60s?" The best minds of the 60s Counterculture were right about 99% of it all. …Amerika.
@livingstranger @senmikelee Of course it has because people in the 60s stood up & pointed to the injustices of racism. MLK..Freedom Riders..
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty Stand against her confirmation as she does not support the USA.
@SenMikeLee @Ruach321 She is totally committed unlimited Executive power.  She is a dangerous person and must not be confirmed.
@SenMikeLee 'you dance with the guy who brung you' is what she is practicing.
Shame on members if they confirm this woman..More Holder
@SenMikeLee LETS SOLVE THE HORRIFIC PROBLEM NOW BEFORE THE NEXT 2 YEARS OF DESTRUCTION !
@SenMikeLee Loretta Lynch is just a corrupt female version of Eric Holder. She is just another addition to a lawless adminstration
@SenMikeLee @JackieKarlsen She can't name a boundry 4 exec power.  THAT IS ENOUGH TO DISQUALIFY HER.  OPPOSE HER PLEASE!
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty    She Did.....She Said It's ALL Good For obama
@SenMikeLee Im disappointed Im already hearing she'll B confirmed. If those who confirm her have 0 problem w/her they had 0 problem w/Holder
@DreamWeaver61 @SenMikeLee  anyone is better than Eric Holder.
@Rushlimbang @SenMikeLee Shes buds with Holders wife. Shes Holder in drag.
@SenMikeLee So, I hope you all make the right decision and DO NOT CONFIRM HER! She is only trouble for America.
@SenMikeLee @arivonelle lets get an American this time!
@SenMikeLee @stacyhyatt That's because you were paying attention-she lacks any belief we're supposed to be ruled by law not men
@SenMikeLee #JustSayNoToLorettaLynch
@SenMikeLee @arivonelle then don't vote the commie in!
@SenMikeLee  Sir.. Approve no more Holder's @arivonelle
@SenMikeLee @00_jackie "Erica" should be guided to the exit door with a swift kick in the butt.
@SenMikeLee @arivonelle Approve no more Holder's.. enough is enough!!
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty She is just another Obama drone.
@SenMikeLee: I am disappointed in Loretta Lynchs inability to articulate any boundaries for exercise of exec power.: http://youtu.be/_UM6xZFQIPw 
@SenMikeLee Please don't confirm her.  Just more of the same.
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9    McConnell Will Make Sure She Goes Though
@truewildeone @SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 If McConnell is going 2 work against t/ ppl HE MUST BE OPPOSED! Oppose the appointment
@SenMikeLee - Do you ever get tired of reading from a talking points sheet? @bmaz
@PeskyJski @SenMikeLee I think Lee's concerns in this regard are extremely valid.
So, WHAT will You DO? “@SenMikeLee: I'm disappointed in Lynch’s inability to set boundaries for executive power.: http://youtu.be/_UM6xZFQIPw ”
@SenMikeLee @willpow357MAG she's Michelle's college buddy. THat should be reason enough. Too close.
@SenMikeLee @SuzieQt154320 You could just say her entire world view is skewed. It is. Don't go wobbly on us, Sen. Lee!
@SenMikeLee Our country is being taken away from us. Why doesn't someone just say it?
@SenMikeLee @FredZeppelin12 that's exactly why O wanted her
@SenMikeLee move on to the next nominee.
@SenMikeLee  AG Nom.Lynch stated that she thinks Holder is going a fine job.& supports Obama. If she gets confirmed = more of the same.
@SenMikeLee @luchadora41 You aren't the ONLY one!
@SenMikeLee @bzaz ~Have you asked her views on voter intimidation and ignoring video felony evidence?Willsheserve "her people" specifically?
@SenMikeLee @Kay15Judy she will be the same as Holder but at least it's only for 2 years
@SenMikeLee @mkibbe doesnt matter progressives are going to confirm her
@SenMikeLee @mkibbe Seems to have all the same beliefs as Holder but is not quite as obnoxious.
@noll_kathy @SenMikeLee  Yes, it is frustrating how many brilliant people follow the the Pied Piper and forget basic principles of d law.
@SenMikeLee - Senator, do NOT confirm Lynch! With gop maj, there is NO reason this criminal is confirmed, unless you're afraid of race card?
@SenMikeLee @cgpb she's a hack! Burn her
@cgpb @SenMikeLee  http://twitrpix.com/c8nhq  http://twitrpix.com/c8nis 
@SenMikeLee Hey Mikey, your hypothetical questions would be laughed at by a judge.  Just talking to those that agree doesnt mean much
@EMAdair225 @SenMikeLee

Maybe Disappointed
But not Surprised.
Who would expect #PrezO
To select an AG
That would Rein Him In?
@SenMikeLee Vote NO, Lynch. She's evasive, can't answer Graham on polygamy vs gay marriage, supports Obama on Amnesty, clone of Holder!
@SenMikeLee @saveusrepublic2 That makes THOUSANDS of US! She'll only serve Obama & will NOT uphold Our Constitution!
@PattiSM74 @SenMikeLee @saveusrepublic2 Hyper politicization of Appointed Govt. Unelected Officials will likely B the undoing of our Country
@libertytombob @SenMikeLee @saveusrepublic2 Agreed! It has already begun as you well know. We must hold our elected officials to oaths!
@SenMikeLee Hillbilly Mormon Teabag Obstructionist confirms he is fine with Eric Holder remaining AG...........Idiot
@SenMikeLee @gipper40Rick How could she? Lynch owes her job to him.....
@chiquibon2 @SenMikeLee This is a leftist government with scared Republicans so nothing will change They will cry for America then excuses
@gipper40Rick @SenMikeLee What are the Republicans scared of? Because he is backed by the Muzzies?
@SenMikeLee @LorenzoCastane3 Join the crowd She shouldn't be confirmed We don't need another Holder | Need some1 to uphold the Constitution
.@SenMikeLee @pkrisci  Me as well!
@SenMikeLee why aren't any Sen saying she disqualified herself when she testified ALL PEOPLE qualify to work when PL99-603 CLEARLY ILLEGAL
@SenMikeLee  She has her own agenda... ANIMAL FARM...
@SenMikeLee Does that mean your vote will be 'NO'?... #LorettaLynch
@SenMikeLee @ChristiChat   Why do we keep appointing racist to head these departments?!
@1usagrunt @ChristiChat @SenMikeLee Because we elected a racist TWICE.
@SenMikeLee @GooGwaba #LorettaLynch has NO business being head of the DOJ!!! @GOP @Senate_GOPs @McConnellPress @marcorubio @SenBillNelson
@SenMikeLee @ChristiChat your never going to get a straight answer from anyone who places politics above principle.
.@SenMikeLee You're being WAY too diplomatic.  This woman isn't fit to work at a Burger King, let alone be Attorney General.
@SenMikeLee @ChristiChat Any Republican who votes to confirm this law-breaking “progressive” does so at his/her own peril.
@SenMikeLee @ChristiChat Can she articulate the meaning and intent of the Bill of Rights?
@SenMikeLee PPL make me sick when they abuse power or back ppl who do Obama knew her in Chicago planned things how to bring America down!!
@SenMikeLee I'm waiting to see what the GOP does with their majority.  It's time to fight Obama & his pack of trained buffoons.
Dear @SenMikeLee, that's cause she doesn't believe there are any. Our government is infested with commies. #NoMasComunisma
@SenMikeLee @SoCalEdgyGal she's waiting for Obama to give them to her
Why didn't you ask her, flat out, what are the specific limits to Presidential power? I think they are written down somewhwere. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee  She flat out said she would violate federal law...how can she be confirmed/
@SenMikeLee @lightning7876 DO NOT confirm her. U know her background, supports ILLEGAL immigration.
@SenMikeLee @Just_a_Texan that's because Democrats prefer dictators over a representative government. Why they love Comrade Obama.
@SenMikeLee @bmaz you and your staff are stupid twats just like Lynch & obama. Lolol
@SenMikeLee @bmaz what do you expect, statist.
@SenMikeLee how many republicans will ignore what this lady said and vote to confirm her just as they did for Holder.  What a piece of crap.
@SenMikeLee I am so glad you helped bring Ms, Lynch's failings to light. I hope a majority of Senators vote to reject her,
@SenMikeLee I bet you are this has nothing to with her it's all about Obama if he says yes u say no,The imperfect expecting perfection
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Do NOT confirm Lynch for AG. @HouseGOP @Senate_GOPs
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler wouldnt you have to know if the gov of a state, had the legal power to do such a act in your hypothetical?
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler kind of a dumb hypothetical,,,because the law determines what one can and cannot do
@SenMikeLee @CarmineZozzora ...please vote No...
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Who will decide which laws she enforces and which she ignores?
@SenMikeLee @Savage_Sideshow Disappointed, but not surprised. #AttorneyGeneral
@SenMikeLee @alilovestexas I'm disappointed she was appointed at all. You're past it...
#WeThePeople are continually disappointed by what is happening in DC. Every. Damn. Day. @CarmineZozzora @SenMikeLee #Constitution #FollowIT
@SenMikeLee sir that's because she doesn't believe there are any limits. You can't articulate what you don't believe in. #tcot
@SenMikeLee #YOUWORKFORUS
@SenMikeLee #FeettoFire we just want a government that IS HONEST.
@SenMikeLee I hope she's not confirmed!!
@SenMikeLee  #NoLynch @izzysroses
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net there are too many red flags going up on her testimony. She will not stop the illegal amnesty exec. order etc.
@SenMikeLee @ScotsFyre her comment on equality of employment opportunities is enough to deny confirmation. American citizens deserve better.
@GaryACarlo @SenMikeLee @ScotsFyre absolutely
@SenMikeLee SLAM DUNK MR LEE! YOU HIT LYNCH GOOD NOW #ImpeachObama 911....
@SenMikeLee @WarriorsHart444 I'm disappointed she thinks illegals have as much right to work here as American citizens! Another radical prog
@OldKid56 @SenMikeLee @WarriorsHart444 yeah.Tht snippet alone should cost her confirmation. Shes a #RAcialist social justice thinskinned rad
@SenMikeLee @WarriorsHart444 Already let my one Senator know I think she is Holder 2.0 Other senator @SenSherrodBrown can't think 4 himself.
@SenMikeLee I agree please don't vote to confirm her.
@SenMikeLee yes but is it just theater or is the Senate actually willing to vote against her?
@SenMikeLee Shorter LL: I'm not going to answer that question.
@SenMikeLee @TruckerBobS It's because she doesn't believe in any and is going to help justify any move WH makes.  Vote No
@SenMikeLee Well should we pencil you in as a "nay" ?
Hopefully not surprised. @SenMikeLee @TruckerBobS
@SenMikeLee Think Loretta Lynch and Loretta Lynn might do a duet? :-)
@SenMikeLee @Patriot_Ink If you really expected & are disappointed, you're dumber'n I thot.
@SenMikeLee  http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/28/jeff-sessions-oppose-loretta-lynchs-nomination-as-attorney-general-over-executive-amnesty/ …   NO ON LYNCH!
@SenMikeLee @dhrxsol1234 I fear she will be just like every other appointment bho has named, they are all run by him!
@tographer @SenMikeLee or by Valerie Jarrett....I don't think bho has the smarts to run a hot dog stand!
@SenMikeLee do not approve her,nomination. She us a radical bigot. No more. We need healing not more destruction.
@jjauthor @SenMikeLee Showing alot with less said.
@SenMikeLee Do not confirm her. She has no respect for the Constitution or law. This will be a test to see who is willing to fight Obama.
@SenMikeLee If she cannot articulate the boundaries, then she shall not be confirmed. Quite a simple vote if you ask me.
@SenMikeLee @tym4tea PATRIOTS HAVE HAD ENOUGH MIKE. IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH IMPEACH B42LATE2SAVEUSA. THERE IS NO END TO THEIR DECEPTIVE WAYS
@SenMikeLee @tym4tea I agree with you, bcuz she is very articulate. I wish you had given her a chance to respond to your response to her.
@SenMikeLee 
The BHO regime doesn't recognize that there ARE any boundaries on executive power!
@grampa_Tex @JrJacktown @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @mboyle1 yeah she's another big government progressive, nothing new here
@SenMikeLee @mboyle1 liberals always refuse to answer truthfully on the grounds that they may be incriminated.
@SenMikeLee @LATiffani1 then stop her
@SenMikeLee @LATiffani1 She doesn't believe in the rule of law. Another activist judge, like Holder. Confirming her will be a big mistake!
@SenMikeLee vote her OUT
Excellent analogy on permits to speed & permits to work...rest of us get the disconnect that lefties rationalize! @SenMikeLee @RickCo01
@SenMikeLee @RickCo01 She is 'In the Tank' with all the other Subversive Democrats just swimming around while giving Americans the Finger!
@SenMikeLee What else can #WeThePeople Expect from an Obama Appointee
@SenMikeLee so are we Mike,she is Holder 2.0
@SenMikeLee @GCGATOR24 Im disappointed that any Republican finds it necessary to confirm her
@bguarino58 @GCGATOR24 @SenMikeLee Very Disappointed.
.@SenMikeLee Well, we're seriously upset that you've turned a simple conformation hearing into a trial of President Obama, so there's that.
@NefariousNewt @SenMikeLee I'm disappointed Mike Lee is a US Senator.
@SenMikeLee @brakktonbooker Senator, you can fully explore your thoughts when one of your guys exceeds Bush's use of Executive Order.
@SenMikeLee @Sr4liberty Loretta Lynch agrees with Obama agenda that illegals are equal to Americans! She's Holder in a female body!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for speaking up. Don't approve her
@SenMikeLee @Bonacker69 >>Don't confirm Lynch.she didn't answer Q's from @SenTedCruz.
What a joke @SenMikeLee: I am disappointed Lynch’s inability to articulate boundaries for exercise of executive power
@SenMikeLee. Do not approve her nomination
@SenMikeLee Vote against her.  Filibuster her nomination.
@SenMikeLee Ask her what she knows about the Constitution of the US?
@SenMikeLee are you surprised because I am sure Obama's appointee will agree with him on most everything.
@SenMikeLee she sounded a lot like "if u like your doctor u can keep your doctor!"
@drscott_atlanta @SenMikeLee Lynch is a student of #GruberSpeak.
All in the family! #EpicFail “@LHolloway2: @drscott_atlanta @SenMikeLee Lynch is a student of #GruberSpeak.”
@SenMikeLee ...do not confirm!
@SenMikeLee @SenRandPaul @McConnellPress @SpeakerBoehner @TGowdySC 
Do NOT confirm her!!!!
#LorettaLynch #AttorneyGeneral
@SenMikeLee So, convince the Republicans to vote no! She's Holder with matching chromosomes!
@SenMikeLee LL was chosen to push the regime's fundamental transformation agenda! 'Catch me if you can' now becomes, 'Stop me if you can'!
@SenMikeLee @jjauthor Why would you be remotely surprised????
@SenMikeLee @jjauthor I agree senator Lee.  She is a clone of Holder.
@SenMikeLee 
Hallelujah!  Why, why, why is she presumed to be confirmed?! She said she wouldn't enforce immigration LAW.  Automatic disqual.
@SenMikeLee Once again we'll be strapped with an AG interested in enforcing only the laws they like and not "OUR" laws. Gonna be a long 2yrs
@SenMikeLee then you must vote No!
@SenMikeLee and yet the spineless "leadership" of the GOP will probably confirm her
@SenMikeLee Handpicked by Obama? It's probably more disappointing when she DOES articulate!!Don't confirm! She won't enforce laws either!
@SenMikeLee   No Surprise there Democrats do not believe in boundaries for themselves.  Power Obsessed.
@SenMikeLee Disappointed, but not surprised? The Republic is dead. We have a dictator, not a president. And no one can do anything about it.
@SenMikeLee It's one thing to be disappointed, but another thing to be surprised. I doubt you are surprised at all. I'm not.
@SenMikeLee  I would agree and ask that they Stop her now, before she can destroy more.
I am disappointed that you follow name-calling juveniles on my tax dollars @SenMikeLee .@jasoninthehouse #ethics
@SenMikeLee Addington and Cheney haz a sad
@SenMikeLee time to make AGs accountable to the ppl!...appointing one is a free pass for corruption...case in point... Barry/Holder
No more!
@SenMikeLee don't vote for her if she is not going to support independence in reality not lip service or checks and balances
@SenMikeLee She demonstrated zero legal knowledge during the hearing.
@SenMikeLee Get ready to trade "Dissapointment" for "Discouragement."
@SenMikeLee Lynch used "I have not studied that issue" to deflect many questions
@SenMikeLee there is a laundry list of disappointments
@SenMikeLee She is the wrong choice and will hurt Americans. She is not for the American people! Do not confirm her in.
@SenMikeLee Don't confirm.
@SenMikeLee There will be no EO boundaries under Lynch. She's just another Holder.
@SenMikeLee You fail to comprehend English when black women speak it. Not her fault.
@dingalingy55 @SenMikeLee LOL "dingalingy"? Your words are useless when you abuse your handle like that. Twitter handle, that is.
@SenMikeLee don't confirm her
@SenMikeLee - Agreed…and her inability to answer simple questions with a yes or a no.  Seems her evasiveness was not #reasonable.  #tcot
@SenMikeLee  red flags!! She certainly seems to agree with this PRESIDENT! WATCH OUT
@SenMikeLee Absolutely right Senator Mike Lee!
@SenMikeLee then can her
@SenMikeLee point is, she was appointed by O & Holder, that is too much evil.
