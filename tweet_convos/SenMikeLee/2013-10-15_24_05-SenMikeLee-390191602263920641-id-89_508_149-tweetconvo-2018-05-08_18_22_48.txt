@SenMikeLee  Senator Lee, thank you for standing against this travesty.
@SenMikeLee WHY Aren't  we using  Article 1 Section 7  of #Constitution to DESTROY #ObamaCare #ACA
@SenMikeLee I suggest you all senators to follow each other. https://twitter.com/sansaku/lists/senators … Would you take this? I'm waiting for your consensus.
@SenMikeLee With all due respect, Senator, your letter is worthless; Obama will do whatever he wants & no one will stop him. Emperor reins.
@SenMikeLee We MUST stop U.N. & cell phone freebies. Cell phones are a luxury item not a handout. STOP the madness, save millions per month!
@SenMikeLee We need to understand our Constitution & the freedoms it gives us & that it won't allow International treaty to trump it!

@SenMikeLee @pondlizard It goes against the 2nd Amendment. It should not even be considered by those who want to keep their office.
@SenMikeLee we appreciate you keeping us informed. God knows the 'leaders' of rep. Party don't do it.
@SenMikeLee Keep fighting the good fight! The Constitution is the law of the land here. Not the UN!!! Down with Fascism!!
