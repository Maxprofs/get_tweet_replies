Good idea @SenMikeLee. Former prosecutor Merrick Garland for FBI Director is great idea. Need special prosecutor too
https://twitter.com/senmikelee/status/862660636903387136 â€¦
Lee = Anti Trump
PICK THE MOST RIGHT WING GUY OUT THERE.   THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS INDEPENDENT NOW -- PICK A GOP WHO WILL BE LOYAL TO TRUMP - THATS NOT YOU
Preet Bharara is a better idea. He would really give confidence to all sides and make Trump look good.
Confidence of Stalinist pro-Fraud Odrama Queen Dims, NO TRUST RESTORED
Makes Trump look like a FOOL
TRUST is not found in Traitor's Approval
@SenMikeLee Go stuff your damn special prosecutor unless it going to tag DNC, Hillary & Obama! How about Reset button, Uranium & Obama on
@senatormikelee Stage, who said i have to wait until I am re-elected! Senate is filled w/corruption! The public doesn't trust you Period.
YEAH AND AN OBAMA LIBERAL APPOINTEE WOULD BE PERFECT -- WHY NOT BRING BACK LORETTA LYNCH? OR ERIC HOLDER?  ARE U CRAZY?  THESE LIBS HATE US
WOW - Your Colors R Showing! Still working W/ #McMullin & #Glennbeck  looking 4 Mormon Prophecy?? SAD and Poor Judgement!
Do you fools never learn? The left is relentless in beating you  and you give up yer bellies like yellow dogs. Why appoint one of them???
Well it sure isn't Merrick Garland. Think outside the box.
HISTORY WILL NOT REFLECT KINDLY ON YOU AND YOUR PARTY. YOU WILL BE LUMPED IN WITH #TRUMP & he's a Hindenburg waiting 2 explode
What a liar u r Lee. Big govmt pro Democrat hipocrit. U dont put political enemies in charge u loser. God help us.
AMEN!
NO TRUST RESTORED w/PROVEN ANTI-CONSTITUTIONALISTS who sold their souls to Fraud Odrama Queen & SOROS
Now including Mike Lee & Garland
1 yr after 9/11 - offered to let MOB set aside election results in which he was NOT a candidate BCZ TERM LIMITS 
& ESCOUNCE HIM as Mayor
@amyklobuchar stay away from recommending prosecutors or judges to head FBI.  NEED DETECTIVE INVESTIGATOR BACKGROUND.
Why on earth would Merrick Garland give up a lifetime appointment on the D.C. Circuit to serve at the whim of a stark raving lunatic?
This is a *precious* suggestion, but no, it's too late for you to soothe your conscience over the horrible way you treated Merrick Garland.
How Merrick Garland was treated? He accepted OBAMA NOMINATION after the UNINVESTIGATED MURDER of SCALIA who was given NO STATE FUNERAL
JUDAS
Obama,Clinton & marxists liked Garland.The NRA did not. I go with The NRA. If he doesn't believe in The 2A, he doesn't belong in OUR FBI.
Now that I know "never-Trump" Mike Lee wants Garland, and Mike says the Dems won't fight him, I know it's a very bad idea.
WUT ABOUT RAY KELLY?
Then you should put Garland out of mind & find a legitimate constitutional originist to act as @FBI director, someone to do house cleaning
News FLASH:  garland will never  be appointed to any post while repubs rule...give it up.
FBI CREATED THE FICTION OF TRUMP RUSSIAN TIES - with WRITERS not INVESTIGATORS
Sat down and COMPOSED a MANUSCRIPT
@amyklobuchar  ,,it doesn't matter who he picks, libs will go just as bat crazy
If libs go crazy, Trump did what we the people elected him to do
drive the TRAITORS to USA CONSTITUTION out of their minds CONSTITUTIONALLY
We trust the FBI a lot more than @realDonaldTrump appointing another crappy, partisan choice.
or better yet a president who can restore respect to the position of POTUS
seems like trust wasn't the issue, until @realDonaldTrump blew up the morale of the #FBI. Keep being on da wrong side of history
You & Merrick Garland WRAPPED AROUND ODRAMA QUEEN'S NECK couldn't restore TRUST in the FBI any better than HILLARY CLINTON and John Brennan
We have/had trust in FBI under Comey. It will be very hard to replace him. Stand we The majority of Americans to expose Trump.
The majority of WHAT - REVEALED Stalinists.
NOT majority of USA CITIZEN VOTERS
FBI director cannot be a liberal
#TreyGowdyForFBI
Special Prosecutor is needed to restore trust
No,  Amy this is a terrible idea ... Garland sits on a left leaning court by 1 .. this is a win for GOP .. nice try Mike
#GowdyForDirector
yep and i just lost all faith in Utah
Troll infested in here...
FREAK
This guy from the convention to now never got over @realDonaldTrump being president. End up being some lobbyist after he's voted out
Agreed but trust will only come if R&Ds work together. Can't be one of Trumps  guys. How about fired US NYAG?
WHO'S TRUST will come after collusion with TRAITORS
WOLVES EAT SHEEP for lunch. When they give you confidence, we know who you are, too.
What hard right has been put up - the OBAMA NOMINEE??? HARD RIGHT???
Are you kidding anyone Obama gives the seal of approval to is shady in my book #notogarland
You should take the job, we would love to see you leave the state to get chewed up in that disaster of a White House.
Go ahead and offer it to him, I hope he denies to even meet with you. He's way to smart to get sucked into that trap.
Won't be Garland unless he investigates the Clintons without passing out immunity deals like porn flyers.
Great idea on Garland
No on Garland. Sorry
NOT GARLAND A Democrat TOOL 
I trust the FBI to investigate Trump. This is what we want.
Joe Arpaio
Trust in FBI never lost. Trust in @POTUS diminishing.
Don't need any special prosecutor - until and unless there  is evidence  of some crime - and there isn't any. #SorosStrikesAgain w/his evil.
Never Garland
I agree, we need someone who will completely stop investigating Russia. Someone who will cover for the GOP, and keep normal Americans down.
yes. their names are Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. for PRESIDENT.
Republican mistrust of @FBI doesn't correlate with the American people. Even McCabe says moral is high, with the exception of Comey firing
and what does that have to do with an activist obama judge?
I miss MN politicians so much! @amyklobuchar, you especially! As Utah politicians listen exclusively to their own tribe
2)  But, wasting my time. Y'll don't read tweets from the American People.  You Only send them.
. 1) Don't believe that's the issue. Obtain Trust w/Congress, AND w/the Pres/VP is the real issue.
after that maybe we can work on restoring trust in the Executive branch?
establishment is trying their best with the phony Russia BS, pay attention conservatives, this will happen to you also if elected president
but he won't listen to you
Trump will top the @FBI w/  a crony
maybe under investigation for $$ laundering w/ the Russians or worse

@Amyklobuchar Stop the circusNo grounds for "special" prosecutor No evidence of "collusion"  Read Henninger WSJ Get on w/impt biz of country
I would much prefer to see Trey Gowdy in that position
This is political warfare with Liberals and the Media if your not will to fight them then get the F..K out of the way. Mister white flag.
Yea I'm positive the DEMS would suggest Gorsuch is the tables were turned. WTF?
Merrick Garland is staunchly liberal.
NFW
Horrible idea. Wow, the capitulation to the Democrat Death Star by even the most "conservative" members of congress is shameful. #WeakGOP
How about a Senator that could actually restore trust in the Senate? When you put party before your constituents we don't trust YOU.
No its not a good idea. You guys just want to fill his seat with a Republican. So no. Nice try senator.
Obama followers are NOT REPUBLICANS, regardless of the label =
$30.00 Louis Vitton handbag from the trunk of a car parked in an alley
Ti restore trust in FBI the special protection afforded the political class will have to be removed bigly&yuge.
Merrick Garland?  Not in a million years!  Why are the GOP always bent upon kissing Democrat butts.  GOP, You are embarrassing us!
As badly as I want, & need to believe in the independence & integrity of law enforcement agencies in this country, I'm losing it.
Not because or Trump's firing of Comey. Just nature of the beast these days. Will be a disaster for US if (when) people see no rule of law.
talk to Sally Yates.
Sad to say, that's a tall order, the FBI has been in a downward spiral since the fiasco at Waco Tx.
OBAMA'S MAN Merrick Garland put up by OBAMA SCHILL @SenMikeLee  couldn't restore trust in a stack of solid gold bullion after Scalia Murder
The REAL TEST is to find out if you are willing to put the country over your party.  #Trumprussia #russiagate #penceisaliar #impeachtrump
"COUNTRY OVER PARTY" means SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION over Stalinist and FRAUD, OBAMA
And open a seat for you to fill on the 2nd Circuit, right?
I would like to trust that this was a sincere recommendation, but you do realize why it comes off as extremely troll-y?
As you point out, trust in institutions is important. Your shenanigans with Garland hurt that trust. Now we need trust, but it's damaged.
I totally agree with you I also think the FBI can't redeem themselves without reopening so big investigations and expose real truth
Mike Rogers
Agreed or Sally Yates.   We still need an independent investigator for Trump Russiagate.
@TGowdySC for @FBI Director.
Trey Gowdy.
ugh... lets not nominate a politician
At its base they are all politicians- they are not machines. They all lean one way or the other and Trey Gowdy would be a great choice.
