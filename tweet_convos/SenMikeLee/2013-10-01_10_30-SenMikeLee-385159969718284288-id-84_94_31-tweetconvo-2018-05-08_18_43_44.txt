@LiberalHDWoman @RepStutzman @BuhByeGOP He got national recognition as a complete jackass. That's something.
@frenchpug14 @RepStutzman @BuhByeGOP just shows they don't care about anything but their fragile egos. American people be damned! #enoughtea

“@RepStutzman: Only the American people can drag Harry Reid to the negotiating table."

We don't negotiate with terrorists.

#GOPshutdown
@RepStutzman there is NOTHING to negotiate, the PPACA IS LAW. Back down and pass a clean continuing resolution!!
@timnovinger @RepStutzman Americans being held hostage since 2009 disagree.
Let our Budget go! #tcot
@RepStutzman See your minions are scrubbing your Tweets and Facebook.Afraid of some real criticism?
.@RepStutzman ACA passed/Upheld by SCOTUS. GOP lost. Obama reelected. GOP lost. Now GOP acting like wimpy whiny petulant....Econ terrorists.
@RepStutzman If the English language had a rape whistle it would be blowing it right now.  You should look up what 'negotiate' means.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee I'd like to drag him to a retirement home!!!
@RepStutzman @vmpcott I, as an American deserve the same treatment as Big business, Govt. employees, Unions. i don't expect better treatment
@RepStutzman I've seen that hot mic video. Your "negotiate" is all polls & talking points. Please be REAL & do your job for Amer families.
@RepStutzman Stop bearing false witness. There's a clean budget to vote on, do your job instead of acting like #15yearoldgangbangers
@RepStutzman Negotiate what? The #ACA? There is no negotiation. How do you keep your job? Its la LAW. Do you remember what that is?
@RepStutzman Well, u alreaded "disrespected" PresBHO, @SenatorReid @NancyPelosi & American people. Guess u excl fr strategy sessions @cspan
@RepStutzman "We have to get something out of this and I don't know what that even is." Rep. Stutzman http://youtu.be/YF1ezkmNTdE  via @youtube
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Pass one bill at a time. Bundled bills full of wastefull spending/ pork is #1 reason why we're in this position
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Why Democrats Are Scared Out Of Their Minds -http://lastresistance.com/3309/democrats-scared-minds/ …
#ActOfDesparation #LiberalRhetoric #Shutdown
@RepStutzman what can American citizens do to get YOU to stop disrespecting them with mini spending bill games & lies? End #GOPShutdown now.
@RepStutzman your comments today... You Sir are a boob.
@RepStutzman  ur remark showed how close minded u are...u shutdown thr gov. And u dont even know y u shuted it .that the dumbest remark ever
@RepStutzman won't help when #GOP feel "disrespected" & "doesn't  know what it wants". #House needs to pass clean CR & stop being idiots!
@RepStutzman Negotiate a law that has been passed and upheld?  Quit whining, America has spoken, do you damn job pal! #GOPshutdown
@RepStutzman You don't even know what you want out of all this.  LOL. Just.. get out of politics.
@RepStutzman we don't negotiate with domestic terrorists. we the people rule, not you tea party nut cases. take your pills.
@RepStutzman personally, I think you and the rest of the hostage takers should be tarred and feathered then run out of office.
@RepStutzman Only @SpeakerBoehner can end #GOPShutdown by bringing CLEAN CR to House Floor Vote - #GOP is irresponsibly hurting Americans
@RepStutzman  Don't Cave or come Oct 17 Debt limit Obama & Dems will railroad @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader @GOPWhip USA = Greece
@RepStutzman  Dems always talk Bi-Partisanship NOW WE KNOW their meaning of Bi-Partisanship Agree With (D) or IT's GOP fault  #MorningJoe
@RepStutzman "We're not going to be disrespected, We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is."
@RepStutzman Pass a clean CR, you troll. No one is buying your narrative, and you all look like spoiled children.
@RepStutzman There Is Nothing For You To Gain This Is A No Win For The GOP & The Dems Will Take The House Back In 2014 & Win The WH 2016!!
@RepStutzman Open your eyes. The America people don't *want* that, so where does that leave you? Grow up and understand reality.
@RepStutzman And only the @GOP can drag them to the altar of a Plutocracy. You took an oath. Your words and actions undermine that oath.
@RepStutzman So, you shut down the government because you can't do your job, and need us to do it for you? And you draw a salary because...?
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee I don't know about that. He doesn't seem to understand words like "representation," or "constitutional."
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Harry Reid voted to fund the government 3 times. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz have voted against funding it 3 times.
@RepStutzman What's there to negotiate? Right-wing Republican's don't get to hold the federal government and public hostage. Do your job.
@RepStutzman "John Boehner's face is this weird orange traffic cone that keeps flashing in front of all our eyes". Make it stop
@RepStutzman It's law. The Supreme Court agreed. Pull your shit together and serve your country.
@RepStutzman So why didn't you skip your summer vacation if this negotiating is so important? Instead, House GOP waited until last minute.
@RepStutzman Please don't risk the economy & default, pass clean cr and raise debt limit! Fight ACA at the ballot if you want.
@RepStutzman @PoliticaILine: (Dem) Senate asked to go to conference EIGHTEEN times since April, (GOP) House said no 18 times... #cleanCR
@RepStutzman Your party needs to act like adults.  No more legislative tantrums.   Donate the salary you don't deserve to WIC
@RepStutzman I'm not even sure if it's metaphorical. They're threatening the well-being of countless Americans to get their way. #terrorism
@RepStutzman On the plus side, this shows how far a community college dropout can go if he's willing to sell out his neighbors.
KEEP #shutdown REMEMBER: #F&F #Benghazi #NSA #Obamacare #Stimulus #Solyndra #media #NBP @RepStutzman @DarrellIssa @JohnCornyn @SenMikeLee
@RepStutzman @RepStutzman , that's how negotiation works. You give something, we give something. *Not* destroying America is not negotiable.
@RepStutzman I want @SenatorReid at the negotiating table...with a ban in assault weapons and single payor. Oh and an increase min wage too!
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Seems like ones available are those who are under freebies- Conservatives are working and don't seem to have time.
.@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Which other laws should we 'negotiate' by shuttering the government? Church tax status?

#p2 #ctl #topprog #tcot
@RepStutzman ransom demands are not negotiations you theif. Thank Gerry for your job. Most in your district hate you.#AusterityPimp
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee No negotiation right now.Only issue should be to end #shutdown.Negotiate long bill term AFTER U OPEN MY GOVERNMENT
@RepStutzman @Jbrock130 He is there 2 work. Not working means he is non-essential- He needs to go home
@RepStutzman The GOP accomplished what Al Qaeda couldn't, shutting down the government.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee You mean only 17% of American's can drag Harry Reid. Get ur facts right.
@RepStutzman As a Veteran I'm ashamed if you! 1 million from the farm bil to your family yet WWII & Holocaust memorials CLOSED #GOPshutdown
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Actually he needs to be recalled. A complete disgrace.
@RepStutzman if that is how you feel they should follow all laws not just the ones they like.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Sorry, but ? How does one expect the millions of unemployed to sign-up for ObamaCare ? How does that work ?
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee I'm sorry, there is no way Harry will go anti Obama's marching orders,when have you ever known him to listen2thePpl
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee But it's high time Democrats start coming to the table.  They don't own the joint.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee I agree completely.  I guess I'm hoping the American people will come to their senses sooner rather than later.
@RepStutzman  America is now 2 camps, the Communist/Socialists (formerly called 'democrats') vs THE AMERICANS. no going back, USA WILL WIN.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee @SenatorReid NEGOTIATE, it's the least you can do. AMERICANS DESERVE QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND ACA WILL DESTROY IT.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee   Reid & dem Senate have denied 4 separate proposals sent by House to keep gov't 'open'. Reid is not going to win.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee @CongressmanIssa just used the term kidnapped in referring to D.C. funding. The entire Country has been taken by Rs
@jalcalanv @RepStutzman @SenMikeLee @CongressmanIssa  your (D) President used the term holding for ransom referring to (R) and the budget
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee 1-2-3 let's drag!
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee i'll give them by the right ankle
@RepStutzman Pass a clean funding bill! Insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results Einstein
@RepStutzman Speaker Boehner is being just as intractable. Defund the #ACA or no deal is just as obstructionist as you claim Sen Reid is.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee Harry is represented by a state that does not care about this issue, therefore he does not care.
@RepStutzman @SenMikeLee But  we won't we will instead Spread the word, #Republicans R #HomeGrownTerrorists.....
@RepStutzman the Senate tried for 6 months to bring you assholes to committee, and negotiate a budget. Now you want to be the hero? lololol
@RepStutzman Stand up 4 #Obamacare. Millions need health ins. Y is #GOP trying 2 convince us we don't want it? We do. #cspanchat
@aubman because just like social security the government has no Idea how to manage it!
@RepStutzman @MarlinStutzman  #StubbornDonkeys are hard to drag. #Obamacare passed without single GOP vote they still  refuse to negotiate
@RepStutzman It's a #DirtyCR that funds ObamaCare.
@gkissel Yep
@RepStutzman nothing should be debated! Pass a clean CR. The AFA is here to stay.
@bradybrown24 Nope!
@dan65630969 yep!
@bradybrown24 ACA will be over in less than 4 years!
@dan65630969 is the Supreme Court going to strike it down? Nope. And I don't think a republican congress will be elected after these antics.
