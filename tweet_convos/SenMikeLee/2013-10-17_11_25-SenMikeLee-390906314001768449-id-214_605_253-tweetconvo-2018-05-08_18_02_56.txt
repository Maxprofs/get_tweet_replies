4 @SenMikeLee & @tedcruz being a true #patriot means fighting to TAKE AWAY your #healthcare It's a demented world do these #idiots #occupy.
@sensiblegreen  Obamacare FORCES u to carry health insurance covering What It Says You must cover; even if you don't need that much coverage
@vmpcott every state FORCES u to carry car insurance covering What It Says You must cover; even if you don't need that much coverage ?..?
@sensiblegreen  Because having a car is a privilege granted by the state;
According to @vmpcott paying car insurance is a privilege while paying for #healthcare insurance is #statism. #WTF #Obamacare #occupy #lol
@sensiblegreen  No Owning a car is considered a privilege not a right; but Health Insurance is not a right;it is a commodity to be purchased
I find it #funny when #teaparty #idiots like @vmpcott think wrapping themselves in a flag makes their un #patriotic logic make sense
@SenMikeLee @regressivesRUs denying healthcare to those in need is very generous of you.  I'm sure your family must be proud. #spineless
.@RodeNode yo loser my young friends healthcare just went up 78% are dropping coverage ur old hippie friends must be proud @SenMikeLee
@regressivesRUs @SenMikeLee seems these "friend" cases are usually undocumented. Employers choose to put the burden on employees #austerity
@RodeNode dude u live in the 1% bubble..u uniformed tool of the corporate USA n thier MSM
@regressivesRUs no 1% in my universe "dude".
@RodeNode ok so u r old n on Medicaid n hve no understanding that the rates skyrocketed for twenties to forties who r not welfare babies
@regressivesRUs lol, I agree with you, but not on #Medicaid  Look at #insuranceindustry and #deregulation as root causes.
@RodeNode not buying tht lib msm corp story, bush had a much better health plan n libs shot it down to create a IRS state of domination
@Bridgittegreene @SenMikeLee What part of “America Moves Forward When We Just Say ‘No’!” don’t you understand, Ms. Greene? Regards, (($; -)}
@Bridgittegreene My sarcasm (putting words into Sen. Lee’s mouth) may not have been clear. Let’s hope the GOP “strategy” soon does them in.
@SenMikeLee Most Americans think you're wrong.
@cressman @SenMikeLee no sir. You are mistaken.
@Rinzl3R860 @cressman @SenMikeLee keep up the crazy! Turn the house blue in 2014! Thanks
@JChurchtown  @SenMikeLee cutting spending is crazy? Fixing our debt is crazy? You're part of the problem
@Rinzl3R860 take some classes, understand the Fed, treasury, currency, banking, and the role of government. Stop living in fear
@JChurchtown I live in reality. This debt isnt good. When is debt ever good? 17 trillion on the shoulders of my genration. #EnoughIsEnough
@SenMikeLee What you and @SenTedCruz have is courage and conviction! The tide is turning! The majority of us want leaders of moral character
.@SenMikeLee We need more like you & @SenTedCruz. We know you care. We appreciate it. You are willing to take the heat. That is rare in DC.
@formerbondgirl @fedupwithgovern @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz It's Obama himself aside from Obamacare who is hurting Americans. Keep the faith!
@IIIBagley @SenMikeLee We are not going away.   http://ow.ly/pV6tw 
You and Ted Cruz are two of the most disgraceful ass backward men in Senate. @SenMikeLee
.@SenMikeLee Thank You! Without you and @SenTedCruz this train wreck would be just a speeding ticket for #Obama Show him the law of the land

@blackacreesq @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz   OR 20 or 30 MORE--The More the Better
@SSNjl @SenMikeLee Agreed. Why isn't this case before SCOTUS right now? Why haven't they re-examined a law gone so wrong? No justice w/#AFA.
@SSNjl @SenMikeLee If #AFA isn't working, If data is Wrong, If enrollees only 36K, If not fixed - NO ONE signed up will have #healthcare.
@SenMikeLee @TheRyanSipple Then you need to investigate this...http://www.occupydemocrats.com/watch-california-man-gets-health-insurance-1-per-month-obamacare/ …
@SenMikeLee : Keep up the good fight, I am behind you. The "CREEP" is going to do everything to throw "AMERICA" in the gutter!
Without #obamacare I would never be able to get insurance in America. You aren't helping Americans like myself. You hurt us. @SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee America is dying, being assassinated by its own people... thank you for trying to stop it
@SenMikeLee Hurting Americans by allowing my daughter to be covered even though she has a preexisting condition? Odd definition of hurting.

@SenMikeLee @Debber66 can't we just tell young Americans not 2sign up if they don't want 2? Obama, congress don't have 2 so why should they?
