All right. But consider #DisarmtheDemocrats!  Democrat voters are responsible for most gun crime. They must be controlled.
Religious nuts are the bigger threat.
Agreed. Take guns from Muslim Democrats Now!
No take assault rifles from everyone but military and law enforcement.
oh good, another #NRAbot that wants to talk about assault rifle vs rifle. ZzzzzZz
can all those rifles do this? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo4kFzECXGs …
.@SenMikeLee If you don't vote for this common sense legislation, I'll work tirelessly to see that you lose your seat.
What part of the 2nd amendment is being infringed upon by closing the terrorist gap & requiring background checks?
Oh! But there are loopholes depending on your state & where you purchase the firearm! Did you know that?
LOLOL you are precious.
I pray you don't ruin this opportunity to save lives
yes you would like muslim terrorists  to be the only ones with guns right?
that sounds like a fucking awful idea. Jesus, no one put this guy in charge of anything, ever!
it is what YOU want right?
dude I don't want any part of your harebrained ideas.
I know they make too much sense and don't infringe on anyones constitutional rights.
your POTUS nominee wants to ban a religion. Are you denouncing for violating 1st Amendment rights? #NoBillNoBreak
no backbone like a jellyfish #noflynobuy #guncontrol #orlando #keepamericasafe
how dare you! You should be ashamed!!!
.@SenMikeLee Since when do you read? You just do what the Kochs tell you to do. Resign now, clown. #UniteBlue
@swimmom0f2 Coming from a Senator who endorsed Ted Cruz 
Yes, Mike Lee is one of the few smart and honorable senators.
A Ted Cruz/Mike Lee ticket would put our Country right back on track
They would definitely have my vote!
@dixieland4life AMEN this is about radical Islam .. if he hadn't had a gun would have been a bomb.
every new death is now on your hands.
you hear that? Listen. That's your name being written in history: Supporter of the NRA, not the people. #DisarmHate #enough
Too many don't understand the intent of 2nd Amendment and the verbiage. Keep Liberty alive, don't pass knee-jerk gun control.
@KatyinIndy  Go ahead Mike fight what 90% of Americans want U should be ashmed U R protectng NRA nt Ur Constituents #LeeisaLoser
You're an idiot if you think 90% of Americans want to have their constitutional rights trampled.
understand please, our founder's gave future generations #2A so well regulated militias could #fight tyranny should it#arise
and we will vote you out and all you GOP in the NRA wallet! Worthless senator!
.@SenMikeLee You realize the Second Amendment says “well regulated”, right?
blood is on your hands. Blood is on your hands. Blood is on your hands. Blood is on your hands. Blood is on your hands.
Could you please move to CA and save us from the Moonbeam?
Thank you.
#nrawhore much?
Hey @RNRUtah, at least your >>@SenMikeLee<< actually reads it before voting!!  WISH TN could say the same. #2AisHomelandSecurity #RNR #2A
SHAME ON YOU!!
@StopLibs you so have to say in your best Akroyd: We're on a mission from God!
thank you
@sltrib I'm surprised you can read. Let me know if you need help with the big words.
Which gun bill does not infringe on my rights? Remember Rights 1-10 come from God and that doesn't change until He says so.
your god is too busy giving kids cancer to worry about the Constitution
Embarrassed to have you as my senator.  not representing your people.
 the good Senator is defending your 2A rights. Have u ever read the 2A?
YES. Have you? No where does it say anything about bombs and semi automatic high capacity weapons
way to go Mike! Stay strong!!!!
from tbe 1700's that's not applicable today
Thank you.
YOU should be ashamed! YOU & @GOP ARE COMPLICIT IN ALL MASS SHOOTINGS!
HOW MANY MORE DO YOU WANT KILLED?
@cnni @FoxNews @maddow
@SteveDeaceShow TY Senator Lee! I'm worried about it being like the IRS, you have to prove innocent. Many don't have $ to fight
would you rather terrorist on the watch list buy AR 15's? #NoFlyNoBuy
gov can add names to that list on a whim.  No thx
there's a way to challenge being on the list. #NoFlyNoBuy #closegunshowloophole
probably run just like that IRS targeting that's still going on in the courts.
where can I find that so I can read it for myself?
if the FBI keeps watch lists for reported terrorist sympathizers, maybe they can check in on them the next time one buys a gun
good!
Thank you Senator for shutting down sneak play run by the democrats to resurrect unconstitutional secret lists outlawed in 1776
@2AFightR what an idiot this guy all gun control bills undermined constitutional rights
Umm, #2A doesn't say "unless someone says it's ok to infringe, then it's ok."
..thank you for your patriotism
forgive the ignorant liberals. When you have no valid points all you have left is sarcasm and name calling. Like high school.
it is a right to pursue happiness. Not a guarantee of safety. Protect the 2nd!  Don't run with the rabbits!
Stand fast. Stand firm. Protect the second.  Too much at stake to surrender to foolishness
Vote against it. 2 much ambiguity. How does 1 get on a terror watch list? By being suspicious. How does 1 get off? Same way.
real conservatives are behind you. Ban gun free zones that would save more lives. How many criminals you know that follow laws?
@toddeherman how can anyone justify taking guns from someone placed on a list with no process to remove yourself in place?
They can't & will simply say--as Obama essentially did--we must give up actual liberty for false promise of safety @NickJeepers @SenMikeLee
does it ban these too?
: Socialist Party (aka old Dem Party) MUST BE STOPPED from constantly violating WE THE PEOPLE's Constitution. TYRANNY!
@Mrjake08 HEY MIKE - I UNDERSTAND - BUT YOU MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND - SO WHAT IS YOUR IDEA?  WE CAN'T KILL ENOUGH TO CHANGE THIS...
Don't say we! I can't understand how some blame the object instead of the person! Abortion kills more every year! 
I wanted some of you to put up more resistance against Obama and his progressive activists
No gun control!  Control Islamic terrorism!!  Restore restrictions that this administration has put on FBI and law enforcement.
Thank you.  I know I can count on you and Ted Cruz to vote against any gun control legislation.  #leavemyconstitutionalone
how banning a AR-15 taking gun rights away? We can keep hunting rifles and hand guns. You must have the NRA in your back pocket.
this post is exactly what ever senator & house rep should do, READ. Then vote, always regarding the constitution as how to vote.
Thank you, Sen. Lee! Unfortunately my sens @RonWyden and @JeffMerkley don't feel the same way. #molonlabe
so what are your plans to stop crazy people from getting  guns n killing innocent people
"well regulated" it's right in there. Maybe you should actually READ the 2nd amendment! #bigly
.@SenMikeLee Which #guncontrol bill numbers should we be watching? #protect2a  #protect5a  #protect14a #DueProcess
thank you for defending the constitution
Please challenge Harry Reid to a duel!
Reading now. I'll vote against any #guncontrol bills that undermine constitutional rights. #protect2a #DueProcess 
@TonyGiusiana Sen Mike Lee How many others will? Why is he still POTUS? Not been arrested yet?
Thank you
Good job, keep earning your #NRA blood money. Maybe u can use it to start a fund for all the unemployed #GOP in November.
simply no way that banning assault rifles violates constitutional right to own guns...you're merely doing talking points
we need more like you in Congress to stand up for us!!!! Spread the word...if they don't they'll be sent home come November. Thx
You're on OUR side, Senator, and that's why we  you!
there should be no latitude for the government to think someone is guilty of anything due process matters
too late registration has begun and is infringed upon our rights 
Period
@wkirkm how about voting against any gun control Bill PERIOD?
Beyond you are the solution "YOU" are the PROBLEM!!!!
But then how will we make 1984 a reality?!? D: 
That was my FAVORITE book! D:<
your the only sitting senator I would ever vote for. 85% if your colleagues are sellouts.
Constitutional rights?  Like abortion, as decided by The Supreme Court?  Or YOUR version of The Constitution?
@KonniBurton Congress HAS NO ENUMERATED POWERS TO TAKE OUR GUNS. NONE!
do we not all have a constitutional right not to get shot the fuck up? How much money have you taken from @NRA
God Bless you and @tedcruz No truer Patriots.
@KonniBurton US Congress can NOT alter our bill of rights without DUE PROCESS by the American People. http://lp.hillsdale.edu/constitution-101/ …
Thank you Senator for preserving our rights.
every one should reread this tweet. All of the tweets from readers makes no sense
Americans are behind you 100%. Veterans 200%, we've been there. Stay the course, keep the Constitution safe for those who can't.
I hate when laws are passed based on emotion and not facts. You all need to be addressing terrorism not gun control.
Thank you Senator
Thank you
Good to know Mike as I  will  vote  against ANY one who try to pass any more meaningless gun laws. Regardless of their party.
@Tazmanian5 MIKE LEE! Thank you!
Thank you Senator Lee. We need more Senators to do the same thing.
@Stand4Liberty_ Thank you Senator!
Liberals: imagine a secret list, ability to strip a right, no remediation, executive action. 

Now Imagine President Trump.
This isn't a bill to ban all guns. You're 2nd Amendment rights are still safe. As a Utahn & a mother I beg u to please sign.
why don't you vote what your constituents are asking for?
defend due process, rule law. If this precedent survives all rights can go at whim of those willing to take them.
I ask that you remember that we have the right to Life, Lib, PoH too and allowing assault weapons-mass killings robs us of that.
how many pages? How quickly put together? Please keep defending our rights
Please consider all of our safety and choose to sign the common sense gun measures in front of you.
@SteveDeaceShow A pol who actually reads a bill?!  Setting the bar a little high, aren't you?
@ThomasPaine5 a guess Ur find with every member of ur famly wlkng around with assult weapon even small children.
Pistols are more convenient, but sure. Society would much more polite.
@jwsmccarty Thank you sir! You, Cruz and few others are the only ones we can trust. I'm feeling beat down & low w obamas rants
Honestly, there should be no proposals or changes. Leave the 2nd amendment alone. VOTE NO - period. @GOP @SenateMajLdr
@RestoreHistory Thank you Sir!
@ThomasPaine5 America's forefathers valued an armed populace. the last resort against tyranny. every gvt was oppressive b4 US
I wonder if Pulse will reopen as a Gun Free Zone once again. Gun Free Zones set up sheep for slaughter.
Thank you. @vjeannek
Absolutely correct that we will not forget.
Thank you for upholding Constitutional rights. It is hard in this emotional  & political  environment. Thanks for fighting 4 us
You're an id*ot j*rk!
@lindarutter they ALL do. WTF? 15 hr by dems=bills on UNCONSTITUTIONAL BS; 21 hrs by R's=zip on UNCONSTITUTIONAL BS. WTF?
Is your vote against any #guncontrol because of the campaign finance support that you have received from the @NRA
Simple question-guns to "no fly listed", yes or no?
@vjeannek Until Congress addresses real issue I am frankly NOT impressed..U all dance around it even now ...
I realize that...but I am frankly not impressed by how many support finger pointing instead of real issue...
I SAID not just Dems are finger pointing elsewhere. 
I did NOT name Lee or Cruz but pointing out a fact
I believe your constitution allows for amendments does it not?
#dueprocess
You're breaking my heart. Really. We care more about guns in this country than we care about human life. God must be pissed.
in history how many countries haven't ended up in dictatorships where they kill millions.
This Utah voter urges you to take action to protect people from #massviolence #backgroundchecks #CDCResearch #assaultban
@N_Fatale
Aren't ALL #guncontrol bills unconstitutional? No power's been delegated for them.
#gunsense is nonsense
Great!  Don't lose the Constitution or its meaning.  We have plenty of laws on the books, just enforce with common sense.
Thank you Senator!
@LADowd hey, he's READING it, unlike others.
I'll work tirelessly to see you GET re-elected. My gun don't shoot by itself. Some people just think criminals should own guns.
@PhatDaddy50 Better be careful bc they want to blame free speech as cause & censoring speech is the next attack on our freedom
@ggg217  we are watching.....
If you can't bring yourself to vote for the bills in front of you, work to build consensus instead of stonewalling. Please.
Your constituents can't craft legislation or vote, but you can. Don't throw us under the bus for the sake of politics as usual.
@Utesbyfive Can you send us a copy to read?
*sarcasm font* You're a member of Congress. You pass the bill to see what's in the bill. You don't read it ahead of time.
thank you Senator Lee
Thank you, Senator. This total disregard for Constitutional rights is getting scary, frankly.
the list as with all lists are used and abused for retaliation against opposition to liberal policies. #2A #VoteNo
in 2009 Frmr AZ Gov Nappy placed Az treasurer Dean Martin on the watch list as retaliation to his fighting her on policies.
what's BS about it, is if your name is the same as a watch lister, you have to PAY a lawyer to get YOUR rights restored.
Thaqnk you senator
is that a correct reading of the constitution or the NRA interpretation?
Thank you Senator.
thank you
And others with you I hope. Thank you.
.@SenMikeLee would rather a terrorist have guns then someone be inconvenienced? 
As your constitutient I'm begging you 2 support #NoFlyNoBuy
@FreedomDisciple 

Nobody is giving them up.

It's just not happening.

People are more than ready for this fight.

Don't do it.
@cmdorsey Mike... They all do, even those already wrote and on books
why, it hasn't been an issue when you vote against abortion, Roe made that part of the Constitution.  @LeahNTorres @AtroposRFH
Thank you Senator. Could you please ensure your cowardly colleagues follow your lead. @SenMikeLee @banda_mlbanda
@VengeanceIsOurs @banda_mlbanda If only there were more like you, @SenMikeLee
@RTHTGakaRoland oh that the rest of congress was so respectful of the Bill of Rights
@FreedomDisciple ..Mr Lee, we know you will that's why #GodFearing and #LibertyLoving patriots love you so much #HaveOurBack
Thank you @SenMikeLee .  Appreciate the great work you are doing in the Senate standing for and protecting Constitutional rights.
@FreedomDisciple thx Mike
.@SenMikeLee We'll know IF you DON'T. That includes 'no fly, no buy' because a DC bureaucrat decides it, which denies #2A

@robertthedeuce
HI @SenMikeLee Thanks for reading before you vote!

Probably easier to be a Democrat senator... All you have to do is vote as told.
Thanks for speaking for the people.
@KatyinIndy good to know as we watch repubs acting like scared little libs.
Well. Regulated. Militia.
Is that how it works?  I thot u had to PASS bills to find out what's in them?  U should explain to @NancyPelosi #Obamacare
why do you think that people on the terrorist watch list should be allowed to buy AR-15s?
@cmdorsey Watch the left wing plan 4 our guns...http://www.floppingaces.net/2016/06/16/the-left-wing-plan-if-you-try-to-buy-a-gun-or-get-a-permit-you-will-be-placed-on-the-terrorist-watch-list/ … #trump2016 #NRA #2A @tedcruz
I'm so thankful that you're my Senator. Keep up the good fight!
remember that there is absolutely no reason to be able to buy an assault weapon for personal use. It is used to kill humans only
your opposition to gun control infringes on the rights of other people to LIVE. You are allowing innocent lives to be taken.
but will you really vote against any gun reform?
That would be any gun control bill.
basically any gun control bill
give no fly no guns for kates law. No less can not be tolerated
.@SenMikeLee It's also gratifying to see a member of either chamber actually take time to read a bill before voting. Thank you!
Seconded - I consider you and Mr. Cruz my Senators.
yes because a gun means more than human life bought and paid  for by the nra
@MOTT7 Start repealing some of this crap and go on the offensive, Senator. I'm gettin' real sick of this crap.
I'm glad you value gun manufacturers over human lives. Don't want to jeopardize those NRA dollars coming through the door.
why can't we just start enforcing all the current laws that are already on the books
http://www.thenation.com/article/how-the-roberts-court-undermined-sensible-gun-control/ …
it's the people not guns. FBI was watching this asshole, and liberals let him go
exactly,the more we learn we find out that Obama has  FBI hamstrung and they cant ask the q's needed to find truth
That would be ALL bills dealing w/ #GunControl
.@SenMikeLee What then is your solution to help fix America’s gun violence epidemic?
@JohnHatch237 @SenMikeLee
this is terrorism and war, not a gun problem!
Agreed. NRA is a terrorist organization and we need to jail them all. Now.
@BattleHamster1 @realDonaldTrump @RealBenCarson Senator Lee, a good conservative choice for VP!
@tweet4upatriots Losing gun rights without due process brings to mind what Lois Lerner did in her position in govt without charg
@GolightlyGrl427 Best pencils ever made by the way
#BringBackPsychiatricAsylums to protect Americans from mentally ill people who get guns and commit heinous acts. No #guncontrol
gun free zone are deadly.  Encourage trained concealed carry.
.@SenMikeLee .@MignonFeldstein The same Govt that wants to create a "Terrorist List" for Gun Control is the same that used IRS against @GOP?
ONE COURAGEOUS SEN MIKE LEE STANDS STRONG AGAINST GUN CONTROL.WHO WILL JOIN HIM?RYAN/MCCONNELL?WATCH&TAKE NOTES!WHOS 4 THE PPL?
"Constitutional rights" or talking points provided by the @NRA? Be sure to vote in the best interests of your constituents.
I would like to see @SenTedCruz bill reintroduced.
you’re a clown
