@SenMikeLee @ksdvm86 and a health care website as bad as the law that established it
Oh, and don't forget we're "an Islamic country" according to DHS advisor, Mohamed Elibiary:  @SenMikeLee @Schmidt2R
@nsroundtable @SenMikeLee @Schmidt2R Oh No We Are Not! And He Does Not Get To Decide This For Us !!!!!
And yet he's in our Dept of Homeland Security. Feeling safe yet? @Gislana449Susan @SenMikeLee @Schmidt2R
Not particularly. Who knows what information he is funneling to his MB contacts. @nsroundtable @Gislana449Susan @SenMikeLee
Oh, they already hv all the info. What's troubling is some average folk listen to him. @Schmidt2R @Gislana449Susan @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @lucille_moss Compromise only works when you have a common goal. That's why "moderates" & RINOs continue to get us NOWHERE!
When people have a fire in their belly, things get done, when they get fat happy & complacent, they just get by. #termlimits @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @Schmidt2R  Obama is the first president in a while to double the nations debt. Remember HE would not raise the debt on dime.
@GraniteState4U @Schmidt2R @SenMikeLee He will almost triple the debt before he's gone :( http://www.usdebtclock.org/

@SenMikeLee #HellHathNoFuryLikeScornedVoters2014
@teapartybloom @SenMikeLee a lot of people mad at tea party... Can republicans and especially conservatives win and hold seats?
@GetsCPA @teapartybloom @SenMikeLee tea party not a fringe group.  They were duly elected by a lot of ppl.  IRS harassment prevented more.
@lisakelly_sun @teapartybloom @SenMikeLee not saying they are fringe, saying democrats have done a really good job of pinning crisis on them
@GetsCPA @teapartybloom @SenMikeLee Oh, I see what you are saying.  Agree.
@lisakelly_sun @GetsCPA @teapartybloom @SenMikeLee Dems can frame any argument saying "Blah, blah and it's going to stop your free $hit" #BS
.@lisakelly_sun @GetsCPA @teapartybloom @SenMikeLee Low info don't care where free $hit comes from or who is subsidizing it #ArguementWon
@SenMikeLee 
Keep up the good work you are doing. Don't be discouraged. We are with you.
@SenMikeLee A good portion of us Thank You & @SenTedCruz for the fight! Many in the @gopconference can say Bye Bye! @GOP is so weak!
@SenMikeLee @HickoryStonewal Thank you for fighting for us Mike Lee.
@SenMikeLee @MidSoutherner 
Mike, thanks for standing courageously!  As Obamacare collapses, the RINOs will be running for cover!
@SenMikeLee we can start lowering the debt by dismantling the national highway act b/c grandma can't eat a freeway for dinner #fixthedebtqa
@SenMikeLee Thanks for fighting for us..we won't forget your loyalty..gotta say wish we had a 3rd party..repubs have lost their way
@SenMikeLee And weak ass caving rat fink GOP establishment leaders. McConnell, McCain, and Graham makes me sick. Keep up the fight Mike.
@SenMikeLee Every battle is worth fighting! RINOs and the idiots who continue t argue for their preservation need t learn that @garygramscom
@SenMikeLee @DaveSchwick   U & @SenTedCruz r the only ppl I trust in Washington. Stand strong WTP r w u
@SenMikeLee Iraq was a difficult battle. How did that go? Oh. It was a war. And the trillions continue to add up.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @betseyross Please thank the @GOP for handing Obama his dictatorship. They've pissed off the makers to appease the takers.
@SenMikeLee @RememberRedDawn It's apparent the IRS doesn't understand it either
And, by my count, exactly 18 people in DC standing up for #Americans. Thank you! @SenMikeLee @RememberRedDawn @tedcruz
@SenMikeLee with where we are now can you and @SenTedCruz prepare articles of secession for those who want America back? @RememberRedDawn
@SenMikeLee @_HughBris  Not to mention the IRS sharing our healthcare private info with who ever asks for it 
@SenMikeLee @marklindesr The debt has now surpassed our GDP. It can never be paid.
@SenMikeLee @marklindesr And now health care regulations nobody is going to be able to understand either!
@SenMikeLee @razshafer shutdown cost the economy 29 billion $ furloughed fed workers who we paid anyway. Hurt middle class.  The point was
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks it's like you fuckers don't remember we had a budget SURPLUS from DEMOCRAT Clinton b4 monkey boy W showed up.
@SenMikeLee @USAB4L clearly you have no alternative but to fight - Winston was political pariah in 1930s!
@SenMikeLee @Im_janipoo A health law nobody wants or understands
@SenMikeLee it's beginning to feel a little hopeless.. THANK YOU AND TED FOR GOING AGAINST DC ELITIST @Tazmanian5
@SenMikeLee @moosebuster2 Doesn't help when the Senate goes 4 years without passing a budget.
@SenMikeLee @razshafer Not to mention an ill advised #Bush medical prescription plan for seniors with no formula to pay for it. #Hypocrites
Of the 17 trillion, tell us how much was built by Reagan, Bush, and Dubbya. I know the answer- do you?
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @razshafer Where was your conviction when Bush put Iraq war on credit card & blew up the deficit by giving the rich tax cuts?
@SenMikeLee People on the other side are joking that you and Cruz are part of a left-wing conspiracy to destroy the Republican Party.
@SenMikeLee "We The People " Understand !!!  Stand United !!! Take our country Back!!!
@SenMikeLee senator lee ,there is no difference between 10 trillion &17 trillion in the hole.
@SenMikeLee @ThorntonB1 Thanks for the fight Mike. You will be proven right when all is said and done.
@SenMikeLee @TehachapiHomes Yep; also way to much back room deal making & spineless people that seem to forget they represent us the people!
@SenMikeLee @TehachapiHomes Yes and until the inept GOP can get its act together and craft a unified front, f'ing Dems will stay in control.
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler Yes.
@SenMikeLee @TehachapiHomes ... Fight for your right! Proceed,Sir!
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 NO my fault my Congressman and two Senators voted NO!
@SenMikeLee @JEANNEinWa Mr. Lee, in the infamous words of Mr. Obama: What debt? Entitlements, no they are now human rights. Tax redistribute
@SenMikeLee $17 trillion debt is the elephant in the room. Don't hear bout it much in Liberal talking points. Weird...
@SenMikeLee @sheril904 Sen., this President has abused his Executive powers, he needs to be Impeached & you, TedC. Should start the proced.
@SenMikeLee @EnragedinCO Kick'n the can down the road? The cans that need kick's is the herd of RINOs roam'n around Washington.
@SenMikeLee @EnragedinCO Mike hang in there. America is behind you.
@BlackrobePrecha @jensan1332 @SenMikeLee @EnragedinCO I'm with you Mike. I'm very proud of your efforts. Great job!!!
@SenMikeLee @sheril904 Why do we still have Lobbyists?I think it starts right there
@SenMikeLee Amen
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Exactly where they want us. the majority of people now can't see the big picture and go along with the temporary
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  Thanks so much gentlemen for doing exactly what we sent you to DC to do. Got it @GOP @gopconference @Senate_GOPs ??
@SenMikeLee @TobyMarie Not enough people CARE is the problem.
@SenMikeLee No sir.  INSISTING on UNWINNABLE battles is how we got in this very specific mess that YOU dragged us into.  #juststop
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks
@SenMikeLee Congressman You & Congressman Cruz are great! Thank you for fighting & continuing to fight even against your own!
@SenMikeLee How can you stomach those RINO's.  I'd be sick having to look at them. #traitors#
@SenMikeLee u and Cruz caused this mess!
@SenMikeLee Absolutely..that and pandering to least astute voters to get elected/stay in office..rather than doing what's RIGHT FOR COUNTRY.
@SenMikeLee @SRRonan If we could we would escort the entire admin and Congress less Conservatives out the door, wait 4 bus throw them under
@SenMikeLee and a bill full of Kentucky pork for McConnell
@SenMikeLee Just business as usual in Washington.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Vote NO Mike.  The beginning of the end has to start eventually, we all know it.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks   Why should I have to pay on average $300 a year to have my taxes done?  Should NEVER be so complicated!
@SenMikeLee Obama is the Antichrist. He's causing chaos purposefully. Pray for us all. This is the end
@SenMikeLee
Thank Lyndon B. Johnson for that.. http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/770072-i-ll-have-those-niggers-voting-democratic-for-the-next-200 …

Ignorance is so bliss.
@SenMikeLee - Nothing but a bunch of whores in DC selling out America !!!!
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks freedom works are the greatest danger to US nothing but lie from them.
@SenMikeLee We're with you!
@SenMikeLee @WickedHuntress 
Not to mention Pork and Deals for Buddies and Supporters
@SenMikeLee Correct.  Imagine a country that is $22T in the hole by the next election.  One word: AUSTERITY!
@SenMikeLee Mary you have no idea what you are talking about or you are evil
@SenMikeLee +legis/prez who R above law/out of touch w real Americans realities @DefundOcare @DefendLiberties Thank You @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee You should have been FIGHTING the difficult battles along the way!! #RIPUSA
“@SenMikeLee: Avoiding difficult battles got us here: $17 trillion debt, broken entitlement system, tax code no one gets”CC @SenDanCoats
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks $2 Bil. For McConnell/Ky? I hope he loses next election
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks additionally you & Cruz, & Paul were magnificant! keep em on the ropes & drag those forsaken Rhino's with you
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks all of senate and hoyuse should be embarrassed! you are not governing by crisis- you are SPENDING by crisis-BUDGET
@SenMikeLee pass a balanced budget in 90 days. Stop paying elected officials unless said elected officials pass a balanced budget.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks That CAN keeps being kicked down that yellow brick road toward ruin of that shining city on a hill. #disgusted
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Keep fighting the good fight you are in my prayers
@SenMikeLee please don't say entitlements. Nobody else is entitled to my money.
.@SenMikeLee Good. Stick to your guns, Mike. Gotta keep this front and center so America recognizes the horror of ACA, ASAP.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Ya'll better start making plans sir. Unfortunately, you have hitched yer wagon to a goat. GOP is dead!
@SenMikeLee keep up the fight Mike us veterans appreciate it
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks lost chance to be a leader, become the next liberator, become the next Jefferson or Regan
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Mike you have got too get this government under control. BHO Is a not a leader. Take control.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks my serious question, why didn't you stand up and fight ACA on the floor? You would have had an army on your 6
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Rome burns as Caesar smiles.
great job @SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks...make people realize WHAT the debt amount is...@BarackObama never uses the actual number
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks 70,000+ pages of tax code?  Who can't understand that kind of reading.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Thank you, Senator Lee, for standing up for the American people!
@SenMikeLee @veroderugy Also, losing difficult battles got us here too.
@SenMikeLee @UneditedPol You &  #GOPtempertantrum cost #taxpayers #billions & nearly crashed the #global #economy! #GOP= #entitled #idiots
@SenMikeLee @UneditedPol senators catering to one percent instead of eliminating loopholes
@SenMikeLee Never give up. l support any primary challenge to John McCain. It's time he goes. Back anyone against Harry Reed.
@SenMikeLee @FlashReport Senator, please explain that to @RepPeteKing - He needs someone to draw him a picture. Thank you. #tcot @GOP
@SenMikeLee but we are no better off today than we were on 1 Oct or before. The American people remain in a losing position. @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee TY Senator for standing with Senator Cruz.  God bless you both.  Many of us so appreciate your principled political philosophy.
@SenMikeLee @jetx86 - make sure to ask ole Mitch about his 2 billion dollar wet kiss from Harry Reid.
@Dzydvl @GlockLady @SenMikeLee @jetx86 the Kentucky Kickback McKickback
@SenMikeLee The ink is not even dry and now they are going to try to ram immigration down our throats. That bill will be 5000 unread pages.
.@SenMikeLee And a partridge in a pear tree. What on earth is stopping us from cutting these absurd entitlements and balancing the budget?
@SenMikeLee Or are the powerful afraid of the competition resulting from a real level playing field? Nutrition, Education, Healthcare.
@SenMikeLee Stop protecting the powerful. Start investing in our most valuable natural resource; Americans.  All of them.
@SenMikeLee is it true there is a provision for voting not to raise debt ceiling? Please confirm or deny.
@SenMikeLee you are bad at your job.
@SenMikeLee they won nothing ! Adding more debt more entitlements , at some point they will pay!
@SenMikeLee HOW MANY #HOUSE MEMBER will #LOSE if they #VOTE 4 EXEMPTIONS on #Themselves WOW http://WhatKindOfCakeDoesHOUSEeat.com    http://VoteUmOut2014.com 
@SenMikeLee Still no reason the shut the government down.  Do your job!
@SenMikeLee Citizens are about to be awakened. No more sleepy time voters. Your time is coming. Next go around will be your time.
@SenMikeLee I get the tax code pretty well. Favors people who can buy Senators, who then screw the middle class folks who can't buy votes.
.@SenMikeLee @FlashReport So, what's up with this "bill" taking place in Senate that bodes to greatly expand visas, handouts, more debt...
@SenMikeLee THIS WAS THE FIRST BATTLE, THE ENEMY LINES HAVE BEEN TESTED, WE KNOW THE LEADERS/ALLIES & WHO SOLD OUT
@SenMikeLee ...  this just reinforces my suspicion that the current decline is irreversible.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your no vote. We appreciate you standing up for us. The debt will be our undoing.
@SenMikeLee And GW BUSH had nothing to do with that? YUCK!!
and 2 wars & unpaid med bill
@SenMikeLee Millions do understand Mike. Its not the tea party that gave us 17 trillion in debt, 90 trillion in unfunded mandates. Dems did
@SenMikeLee Stand tall..DO NOT GIVE UP!  WE STAND WITH YOU!  ITS TIME TO GET DOWN DIRTY AND FIGHT!
@SenMikeLee @heritagektown if I was a large debt holder I would start selling all of. Because chances are I will never see a penny of it.
@SenMikeLee the government is out of control.  I am ashamed of this ores and Senate.   Enough slamming America
@SenMikeLee compromise is what's lacking in Washington. Drawing lines in the sand helps no one
@SenMikeLee U and Cruz r amazing. True leaders, men of character. U bring tears to my eyes. Keep up the good work. We r out here with u.
@SenMikeLee you are a fool
.@SenMikeLee nice job. thanks.
@SenMikeLee Don't forget the scrapping of the rule of law, well that outdated constitution stuff. Thank Barack, we'll now be led by the nose
@SenMikeLee Many difficult battles have been waged long before you & Tea Party were around. How about those unpaid wars & Wall Street greed.
@SenMikeLee To fight a battle requires a spine and a certain amount of intestinal fortitude. Both of which are in short supply in congress
@SenMikeLee @SarahPalinLinks http://www.barenakedislam.com/2013/10/16/egypt-mohamed-morsi-trial-destined-to-lay-bare-barack-hussein-obamas-nefarious-muslim-brotherhood-connections/ …  WTH?!?!?!?
@SenMikeLee Keep up the fight. Educating the low/no info voter is part of the battle. What part of overspending is hard to understand?
@SenMikeLee Thank YOU for standing strong and for helping to bring the issues to the forefront - even though the drive-by media didn't.
@SenMikeLee bla bla bla #tea
@SenMikeLee Yes! It's Congress' job to debate the tough issues, and make hard decisions. It's all about money and power in DC. The easy way.
@SenMikeLee A policy of just saying no to the president is why we are in this situation. What are GOP solutions? Other than whining?!
@SenMikeLee proud of you and all fellow Constitutional Conservatives for voting for American Values, not Washington DC politics
@SenMikeLee you, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz have integrity. Many of us will remember your efforts.
@SenMikeLee Starts at the top. Hate to say it, but POTUS is a coward.
@SenMikeLee Amen!!  What happened 2 the 2011 SUPER COMMITTEE??  Boehner caved on the dept ceiling then 2.  Promising 2 fight next fight.
@SenMikeLee It is so invigorating to see a handful of quality Congressmen that reflect the values and dignity of our Founding Fathers!
@SenMikeLee I'm looking forward to "Flat Tax" Legislation!!
.@SenMikeLee thanks for trying keep educating voters
@SenMikeLee no thanks
@SenMikeLee and senators who serve their special interests and not their constituents
@dragonflyfntasy @SenMikeLee It is people like u who r destroying this nation with ur ignorance.
@patriotmom62 @SenMikeLee My statement is destroying the nation? If you think that you must be Mike Lee's wife, or live in a cave.
@dragonflyfntasy U will find out the hard way. get back to me when u get ur obamacare and let me know how great it is.
