Yes, and that last word will be "thanks," @SenMikeLee.
@LeahNTorres yay! Fund #ACA so I'll get more $$$ to kill women's babies! Burn, Rome, Burn! #firstdonoharm
Withholding standard medical care to those who need it is in fact doing harm, @bleufishcat. #WhyDoIDoAbortions? Primum non nocere.
@LeahNTorres @bleufishcat I wonder if Dr. Torres can hear babies say "thanks" once the murder is complete and the scissors are in the skull
Scissors aren't used, @jaywelliott. If they are, you're doing it wrong. And there are no vocalizations so "thanks" can't happen.
@LeahNTorres I hope that rationalization helps you sleep at night after a hard day's work. I dint sleep has been ann issue for you tho #tcot
I sleep very well knowing that my patients receive excellent, evidence-based health care, @jaywelliott, so thank you. Sleep well.
@LeahNTorres I like the sanitized language. You're very clever doctor. #tcot
@SenMikeLee Gotta tell you man; you are the REAL DEAL. Proud of you! And I like the crowd you hang with, too.
.@MCTStJames But the 3 amigos basically got us NOTHING   #zero
@Dark_Red_Hair You don't refuse to fight because winning is unlikely.  They are doing what we sent them to do. It's all we can ask.
They weren't doing what I send them to do. We asked for more & they caved. @MCTStJames
@Dark_Red_Hair MMc sold out. Boehner caved. But the 3? How? McCain/Gragam/King hates em. All the MSRinos hate them. What more cld they do??
.@MCTStJames Maybe the 18 etc. couldn't do more, but don't praise saying they did what we sent them to do ---> they didn't get it done!
@Dark_Red_Hair We differ. Victory is never certain. Numbers are what they are; their hearts are right...I give credit. They're best we have.
(cont @MCTStJames ) They didn't get the job done - and here's where we may differ -- I think they could have!!!!!!!!
@JeffLassiter @SenMikeLee people didn't get to say a word, dummy! Obama and Democraps spoke for them. #democraps #obamasucks #youareatool
@JeffLassiter Oh no, mister! People like you simply don't deserve names. Very seldom sheep get to be named. You aren't that special.
@JeffLassiter ask me if I care. Feel bad for the country being ruined by "people" like yourself. #Obamabot
@SenMikeLee sadly, much of the damage already done, & on the way, can't be undone in my lifetime. #DefundObamacare #DefundObamacide
@SenMikeLee @Rockprincess818 and we'll have to suffer through the gubmint saving the day by putting us all on single payer. Goal all along
@SenMikeLee @GOP_RN For years our government has had the mentality that they know what's best for us more than we do. It'sjust getting worse
@SenMikeLee American people do not know what they want.  More divided than we have EVER been in our history.
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin It's time someone in govt tells uninformed Americans that Obamacare isn't FREE!
@SenMikeLee @carolinagirl63 When they realize how they've been OBamboozled, they're gonna be pissed!
@SenMikeLee @NoInfidel33 So hope you are right Mike
I hope he is too. At least he's n quitter @e_tme @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber You got that right.
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber Can we use the term "final say" instead of the last word. The last word reminds me too much of Chris Matthews.
@SenMikeLee @Earthfire9 - let's hope voters remember this and do something about it
@SenMikeLee @WDTnow preach sir, that's the God honest truth, ppl won't pay attention until their pocketbook takes a hit
@SenMikeLee we did...in November of 2012! #suckstobeyou
@SenMikeLee your still in a dream world
@SenMikeLee That's right Sen. Lee~We have a President who no longer governs for the by the people. The MB have greater negotiating power w/O
@SenMikeLee @gayla415 thought we might see the beginnings of that in NJ, but it didn't pan out tonight
@ResearchRatCT @SenMikeLee what happened to NJ? Sorry.
@SenMikeLee @DrKC4 when dc starts taxing our healthcare as income...there will be some serious trouble
@Amyloukingery @SenMikeLee they're already taxing our life insurance as imputed income.
@SenMikeLee not if we all die first because we can't get in to see a doctor
@gary4205 @SenMikeLee I'm in Jersey.We got hit with Booker tonight! Texas sounds nice. I can learn to love country music!
.@SenMikeLee Yes we will have the last word. GOP and stupid teaparty favorability almost at rock bottom & ACA is up. I think we've spoken
RT @SenMikeLee There will be very real consequences for people in both parties as a result of #Obamacare American people will have last word
@SenMikeLee Many Obamacare supporters think they will be getting FREE health insurance. No one in the GOP is explaining this to the sheep
@SenMikeLee @hollyR_J_N impact on family budgets will not be forgotten.
@SenMikeLee @carolinagirl63 SEN. MIKE LEE, MAYBE GOD WANTED IT THIS WAY,TO LET OBAMACARE IMPLODE ON IT'S OWN, THE BLAME WILL BE ON THE PRES.
@SenMikeLee @kraig4u yup, 2014 can't come fast enough!
@SenMikeLee @Rockprincess818 ...cheesy grins & Chicago politics do not a real world program make...
@SenMikeLee Yes we will! @CRODAGNONMAN
@SenMikeLee @priesterpr I hope your right. Seems like the media will never allow us to kno how bad obamacare is.. They will say its great
@SenMikeLee @AmyKremer THEY WILL.  THE PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU SOMETHING AND YOU ARE NOT LISTENING.  SHAME ON YOU.
@markgstachowski @SenMikeLee @AmyKremer ??? #Lee what is wrong with you, besides your friendship with #Cruz?
@SenMikeLee The  GOP has lost the confidence of its members. I will defund thw GOP until the progressives are gone.  @eeners
@SenMikeLee @BlueWaterDays  We Love You-But You Need More Media Time-Must Figure This Out!! Pple Have No Voice w/o You/Ted/few Others!
@SenMikeLee Yes Sir! There WILL be consequences for Republicans that turned their back on their base! @SenJohnMcCain  and his ilk are FIRST!
@SenMikeLee I hope the #lowinfovoters figure this out before the midterms, Senator Lee.. @BlueWaterDays
@SenMikeLee  Thank you for riding towards the sound of the guns on behalf of our country. We the people will not forget. God bless you.
@SenMikeLee @sherrysamples how?
@Gratefulval2 @SenMikeLee We keep fighting and also Obamacare can't help but collapse. We will have the last word, maybe not tomorrow.
@sherrysamples @SenMikeLee I'm praying and hoping!
@SenMikeLee @sherrysamples When? After the damage is done to the people? Its kind of late then.. They don't reimburse after they fine you
@2Pockets2 @SenMikeLee We can't just lay down! We must keep up the fight. We can't sit back and say someone else will do it.
@SenMikeLee I'm afraid that's what it's going to take for people to believe it. All I can say is the Dems wanted it and they got it. Enjoy
@SenMikeLee @WNeiljohnson Mike sorry to hear U R still a member of the New brand party #Capitulation Party tks 4 standing with WE THE PEOPLE
@SenMikeLee @DebraPianalto more horror stories will not be covered by lame main media,,can't make O look bad..
@SenMikeLee t party 2016 presidential candidate
@SenMikeLee @Kathy_Amidon DAM RIGHT WE WILL!
@SenMikeLee @MootsaGootsa You better believe it, and none of you are safe.
@SenMikeLee @LetUsPrayAtSix ask AARP and united healthcare about fired doctors
@SenMikeLee OBCare is making a nation of part time works, have to work 2 jobs & still no insurance! What the HELL is going on!! WAKE UP!
@SenMikeLee They should have gotten more, changing a 30 hr. to 40 hr. work week, to help job growth at least!
@SenMikeLee THIS WAS THE FIRST BATTLE, THE ENEMY LINES HAVE BEEN TESTED, WE KNOW THE LEADERS/ALLIES & WHO SOLD OUT
@SenMikeLee @BossHoggUSMC Yes sir, I believe they will!! 
@SenMikeLee People will GET IT when they really feel the consequences, but RINO's will still be the same people
@SenMikeLee People will get it when they feel the consequences
@SenMikeLee @shakhill I hope your right but with a representative republic WE THE PEOPLE are supposed to have the 1st Word. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee  Yes they will.
@SenMikeLee Yes Sir, and God Bless your efforts. Make sure you give McConnell, and Graham best wishes for their future's after office.
@SenMikeLee I hope some people see this. No more access to doctors, the crunch is already here
@SenMikeLee I hope they enjoy getting what they asked for with #obamacare May they all enjoy paying through the nose.
@SenMikeLee @AmyKremer You and your Tea Party cohorts should be required to pay the $24 billion you cost us with your political stunt!
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea AMEN AND AMEN!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea Amen.
@SenMikeLee 
Prohibition was the "law of the land" and it was repealed.  Therefore their is still hope that ObamaCare can still go away!
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea Hopefully, Big problem though,if that last word does not come soon,it will not matter.
@SenMikeLee its not called Obamacare it is  called affordable healthcare then why are the Republicans whining  so much about it!
@SenMikeLee Yes.  When you get bounced at the nomination convention just like Bob Bennett, people will point to this moment as why.
@SenMikeLee I doubt it once he shoves immigration reform down your throats we aren't we the people anymore
There will be very real consequences 4people in both parties as a result of #Obamacare. American people will have the last word @SenMikeLee
@senmikelee Would you finish this quote?A dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people.
@SenMikeLee @ChristieC733 AMEN!!!
@SenMikeLee They laugh and mock hard working Americans now until they realize there careers in politics is over
.@SenMikeLee i accidentally insuranced myself how do i fix this #please #respond
@SenMikeLee CC: @FreedomWorks #WAR #DefundTheGOP
.@senmikelee only if you mean that their last words on Obamacare will be: "yay, we're insured!"
@SenMikeLee I'm very let down that the republican party has no backbone anymore
@SenMikeLee thank you for standing with the American people and Senator Cruz.
@SenMikeLee @yunsun1967 Mike. I like U, ur spirit of fight and resolve 4 USA. I will follow U. Thx 4 being 4 #WeThePeople
@SenMikeLee like the 66m of us that voted for his reelection? Pretty sure we had our say....and will again..gerrymandering can't fix all.
@SenMikeLee American people will have the last tear.
Like me not being dropped by my health insurance for "pre-existing conditions"? Cancer patients with no cap on coverage?
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Would you like to join my new party.
@SenMikeLee @KayakSandy You bet there will be consequences. & some won't like them!!
@SenMikeLee Real consequences? You're darn right there will be … people will have health insurance.
@SenMikeLee oh yeah & pple like #McCain,  #McConnell,  @johnboehner  & any & all liberals are due for change in 2014! #TCOT #TGDN
@SenMikeLee God bless u Senator. I stand w u & @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee @1catherinesiena American people brought this on by voting him into office.  Perhaps it is time to humbly repent, face reality.
@prolifejoan @1catherinesiena @SenMikeLee Tell em til blu n d face. They wont hear. IT'S GOD THAT SETS UP KINGS & PRESIDENTS. judging nation
@SenMikeLee @CathyCS the way things are going, I wouldn't bet on it. The more Obama gives away, the stronger the allegiance to his party
@SenMikeLee The American WILL have the last word, when we kick out all the idiots in congress. Good luck covering your ass.
@SenMikeLee Keep fighting for us! #makedclisten
@SenMikeLee @1catherinesiena  Help us (praying someone hears & that its not our last word)
@SenMikeLee @TheRyanSipple And Washington will not like it when We do!
@SenMikeLee I hope so today's vote in NJ unbelievable . Our children & grandchildren will suffer under #ACA  @mariewmcclellan #defundtheGOP
@SenMikeLee What do you think will happen when the IRS starts withdrawing money from peoples accounts and leining their houses.
@SenMikeLee  yes, we will have our say !  Blunt just lost a lot of votes
@SenMikeLee By next year, Obamacare, the Economy and the Banks will be in the shitter and Barry will be back saying raise the debt  again
@SenMikeLee @AmyKremer I am keeping a list of votes in my purse - ready to use at any opportunity
@SenMikeLee everyone should live by the Law. If you are American you have #Obamacare period. No one is above the law.
@SenMikeLee @jsinacore007 House will pay country will lose dcraps will control gov. "We the People" get screwed again! Helll socialism.
@SenMikeLee @LillyIsFree thanks for trying to fight for our rights
@SenMikeLee yep last word, last vote, you can go ahead & pack your bags mr. lee, your fired!
@SenMikeLee yeah, greater access to medical care and preventative medicine = healthier population and lower costs. Consequences I embrace!
@SenMikeLee we have.U lost. Now move on 2more importnt matters such as jobs, lo wages, poverty, tax reform, infrastructure, Tx reform etc
@SenMikeLee @MrMosis were you in a coma in November? Americans have ALREADY spoken. Elections have consequences deal with it.
@stormkrow 2014 will make 2010 look like a non-event. A few spoke in Nov. Most were in a coma. Obamacare pain will awaken many. @SenMikeLee
@MrMosis @SenMikeLee check the polls lately?? How'd those polls work out for you last election? How was that "landslide"?
@stormkrow 2010 was Obamacare referendum. Check those results lately? 2012 was the uninspiring Dem-lite candidate Romney. You'll see! =)
@MrMosis because the "real" conservative candidates were soooo loved the couldn't even win the primary?
@SenMikeLee @GrodenBiker You ain't just a whistling Dixie, Mr. Lee. Cos it's gonna blow.
@SenMikeLee @pegenz Thank you for listening . We stand with you & Ted & Tea Party.. Keep standing together .We need you in 2014 & beyond
@SenMikeLee @anabomb25 get rid of the exemption list so enough ppl and groups feel the pain to make a difference and show POTUS duplicity
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up for Americans! We appreciate you!
@SenMikeLee When Americains find out the real truth about the bill they will wake up and raise heck!!!!
.@SenMikeLee Yes. Unfortunately, it will be, "fine. Just give me the damn morphine, then."
@SenMikeLee  Caucus every member who voted on their knees, instead on standing on their honor.
@SenMikeLee they already have, sadly. We are the minority now...
@SenMikeLee Poor woman It is not her fault This is getting to ev1  http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/17/stenographer-dragged-off-house-floor-after-protest/ … #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee The American people the ones who do all the working and paying taxes did stand up and we were let down by the boo hoo boehner
@SenMikeLee I look for a downgrade soon
@SenMikeLee  Does anyone pay attention? How many more times is the President going to stick it to the American people and get away with it?
@Mammagistweetin @SenMikeLee jw, how, exactly, did he do so? Specifically this time...I'm sure you could go on and on. Just want example
@SenMikeLee @jimLinduff 
If that is true! How do our leaders keep caving? (Not you) Nobody takes us at our word because we keep caving!
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler ... Let's hope so.
@SenMikeLee this pres has shredded the constitution and anointed himself king.  Don't understand why you guys can't impeach
@senmikelee Thank you for not backing down!
@SenMikeLee A new communist mayor in New York City and Booker in NJ And you all in DC.  doesn't seem voters know what they're doing at all
@SenMikeLee  Thank you for the good fight.    Silent minority of country is very unhappy with status of this administration.
@SenMikeLee Our votes don't seem 2 matter much when our Representatives can B bought
@SenMikeLee You are so right we will have last word. SenVitter stays SenLandreiu and RepBoustany are out &  our new Sen. will be RepCassidy
@SenMikeLee collapse, single payer, then hyperinflation. Apparently there are 10 people in the country that can do math. Thanks for fighting
@SenMikeLee there will be in 2014 #outwithincumbants
@SenMikeLee Thanks for fighting the Good Fight.  God bless you and God bless the USA!
@SenMikeLee @nswells I hope so.  doesn't seem like many people care about the details or consequences of this.
@SenMikeLee   That's right. Buh-bye, teabaggers.
@SenMikeLee  Thank you, Senator Lee.  The people know how hard you have worked on our behalf and are appreciative.
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS!  KEEP FIGHTING!  GOD BLESS!
@SenMikeLee thank you!
@SenMikeLee So true.  And here, as I type this, there are democrats on Fox News telling @seanhannity that O-Care is working perfectly.
@SenMikeLee   WTP will have the last word&we will remember the traitors of freedom. TY for standing in the face of evil. We will not 4get
@SenMikeLee as 1 of the "people". I do not want a gov shutdown, I do not want to be on the brink of economical implosion. I do not want you.
@SenMikeLee go away and shut-up. We've heard enough from you and your crazy buddy Cruz for the rest if our lives. Both are losers.
@SenMikeLee At this point, we worry if we really have a say. We stand with you but it is appalling to see the @GOP attack their own.
@SenMikeLee I appreciate your efforts & thank you for standing for those of us without representatives that care or listen! #FairnessForAll
@PatiWoodburn @SenMikeLee good luck with that~ you'll need to wake him from his cruz-crack induced stupor
@SenMikeLee  we are behind you! As for the RINOs:

2014 #OPERATIONPAYBACK
@SenMikeLee American people are paying for it with our blood sweat & tears! Our children & grandchildren will pay the price 4 Obama's votes!
@SenMikeLee we need to get rid of the irs  let obama own that one
@SenMikeLee Let's hope it's the Right side of the American people we hear from! #DefundObamacare
@bleufishcat defund affordable health care that your god damn Republicans started
@SenMikeLee will we be heard?  I don't feel like my voice has been heard for the last 6 years.
@SenMikeLee Those still living, anyway.
@SenMikeLee @RealTXTarheel Thanks for your valient effort to try stopping Ocare.
@SenMikeLee The GOP, with a few exceptions, threw the people under the bus tonight.  #DefundTheGOP
@SenMikeLee Sorry, but the American people voices are no longer heard. I am afraid that the Republic is receding. We all are loosing! #tcot
@SenMikeLee Real consequences like people getting insurance.  You need to go home and pray. Talk to people at your church who don't have ins
@SenMikeLee IF the American people had the word this shutdown would've never happened you dumb fuck.
@SenMikeLee you and mr Cruz stay faithful to a conservative America and we will stay faithful to you.
@SenMikeLee @RealTXTarheel The last word, at what cost?
@SenMikeLee we need choices, a competitive market place.
@SenMikeLee @SenatorWarner @timkaine @RepWOLFPress Oh yes there will be real consequences!
@SenMikeLee I stand with MIKE!!
@SenMikeLee thanks for fighting, those of us in the care of sick ppl, not just "woman's health" already see care being compromised
@SenMikeLee Amen  Dems Own this Now- all of  it
@SenMikeLee I wonder what that 24 billion lost by you idiots may have provided for those who needed it most,veterans,seniors,children,etc,,
@SenMikeLee exactly I like that u include the other side.U guys need to use this language when speaking.Dems will b/r hurting as well
@SenMikeLee The people will have the last word while the irs takes our last dime to pay for a pipe dream that we never wanted #dysfunctional
@SenMikeLee Wouldn't it be nice to tell some Senators in the party how you really feel about them
@SenMikeLee When people realize what Obamacare is doing , you and @SenTedCruz will be angels. Hang on.
@SenMikeLee That depends. Communist leaning MSM will lie and tell everyone how wonderful OCare is as it bankrupts the country.
@SenMikeLee Hey Bro you make any money on the shutdown ? I got $2million in contributions. Now I am going to be hitting them every week. Luv
@SenMikeLee Kick rocks! Do u know wht u did to families,communities&businesses?PRIDE comes B4 a GR8 fall! Watch out below
@SenMikeLee praying
@SenMikeLee How True How True that the American people will have the final word once they see what the ACA bill is going to really cost them
@SenMikeLee Yeah & you ain't gonna like what they say neither! #ignorantRubes @GOPtraitors
@SenMikeLee Dang straight!
@SenMikeLee that's what I hope, pls keep fighting, we are paying attn, thank you sir
@SenMikeLee the problem is that if the American people cannot depend on its representatives to support them without caving into threats
@SenMikeLee appreciate you, Mike!
@SenMikeLee didn't stop the cave in by GOP. Looks like business as usual.  Meanwhile, lives across America are ruined! #longtermunemployment
@SenMikeLee @JohnCornyn @tedcruz I am so mad at the @GOP . Why?
@SenMikeLee not just about the ACA. Sick of constantly raising the debt ceiling. #enoughalready! #timeforarevolution
@SenMikeLee The Free Stuff seems to be winning the day & the ones paying the bills are not paying attention. Not Voting has consequences.
@SenMikeLee I totally agree with u Senator. The American ppl will prevail. Trust me.
@SenMikeLee There will also be very real consequences for the Amerikan people because of 0bamakare.
@SenMikeLee Precisely - the president's signature legislation will have horrendous consequences for Americans.  Praying for you and Ted Cruz
@SenMikeLee Yeah, too bad you're not up for re-election next year.  I'd give you my last word...
@SenMikeLee who's gonna save us?
@SenMikeLee For God sakes shut up. When are you & Teddie going to apologize to the American people for your stupidity that hurt millions?
@SenMikeLee How about #ObamaDoesntCare ? He couldn't give a crap about the U.S. and/or US.
@SenMikeLee thank you for fighting the good fight and I for one am very grateful for your efforts
@SenMikeLee Time to rebel!!  Time to arrest the dictator and Valerie Jarret.
@SenMikeLee We did have the last word, remember the 2012 election?!
