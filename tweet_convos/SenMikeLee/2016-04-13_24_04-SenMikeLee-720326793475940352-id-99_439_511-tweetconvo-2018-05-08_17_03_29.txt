@BrydgeVerdun @EngrishPorice it's also social media not the pearly gates. That's gods decision. But if you need a ladder for the high horse.
@SenMikeLee so helping a city thats been poisoned with federal funds will add to the nations deficit? You are a evil, cold hearted asshole!!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Are you also proud of blocking a bill to support Flint Michigan?
@SenMikeLee  @SenTedCruz @DailySignal you think Trump could do this? He knows nothing about running gov't & can't bring jobs-congress does
@SenMikeLee the city of Flint needs that $250 Million NOW & your holding it up because u don't like the way it's being funded? ASSHOLE MOVE!
@SenMikeLee if your family was living in Flint I bet you wouldn't be doing what your doing now. You need to pray heavy for forgiveness!

@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz It instilled fear in those hard working individuals like Secretaries, janitors, contract specialists.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz When you shut down the gov. you threatened people's livelyhood. Yes, they got back pay but it was no guarantee.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Ted you shut down the government on YOUR principle.Government employees are not trash to be discarded.In most cases
