@LADodgerReb @SenMikeLee Fucking liberals trying to define every Fucking thing to fit their narrative. It is fucking sad
Joan's not my mother thank goodness
want to reduce abortions in Utah? Put REAL sex-ed in schools, not just "abstinence!"  It's PROVEN to reduce unwanted pregnancy!
wait... choose life by refusing refugees? Alternate facts....
You don't choose life when you are on the wrong side of history voting down party lines to pollute the world and bomb human life. Hypocrite.
Whose life? The only lives you seem to care about are the unborn.
, butt out of women's health!
#ACA saves 1life/455enrolled/yr per New Eng J Med.  46k lives/ yr saved. If you kill ACA, you're not #prolife. You're #pro-birth
These marches exclude the bodies of the millions of refugees. More refugees and victims of war will die than aborted babies. Focus on that
Seeing how you'll never be confronted with this issue, it's very brave of you to weigh in on my repro rights.
the life of a fetus but not supporting the life of the child later in life, the mother during pregnancy and after. #prochoice
how grateful are you for refugees to the US who are seeking to save their OWN lives?
.@SenMikeLee So you're #ProChoice?
But once born, they become leeches, sucking gov teat if poor?  That's the sick GOP thought process. YOU are not pro life.
i support the courage to not force your beliefs onto others
.@SenMikeLee I'm grateful for the millions of Americans who don't allow their personal feelings to interfere with the freedoms of others
If you choose life, then support it after it's born. Otherwise, you only support birth.
while you make them chose between feeding them or taking care of their medical needs.
and that is their choice,it must always be a choice.don't legislate my morality and my life with your opinion!#WomensMarch
Orwellian use of "choose", when threading force of state vs bodily autonomy.  Non-fake small government needs individual choice.
I'm grateful for Planned Parenthood. You know, a health care service that lets women LIVE so they can have health kids.
Please choose life for the children of Flint, Michigan. They need clean water to drink and bathe in.
I am grateful for the Supreme Court for giving me choice and dominion over my own body. #RoeVWade #mybodymychoice
and yet you take life away from children of Flint. Have u no shame. Hypocrite.
pro-life does not = anti-women's march. Show me where it said prolifers not welcome, or stop sharing inflammatory fake news.
I am grateful for the millions who recognize women's reproductive rights and stand up for equality.
Now let's continue to make the right decision and educate them properly. NO on DeVos.
Then you would be wise to support complete insurance coverage of contraception.
I sure hope your love of life extends to those who are already living. STAND UP for refugees seeking safety here!
where is your statement of the lives of refugees and immigrants?
Do you have the courage 2 speak out against the unconstitutional Bannon executive order?  Will you choose THOSE lives to stand 4
& for many is not a choice but a necessaity
All lives matter, huh? How about the lives of LEGAL residents of the USA who are being denied entry? How about them? #Cowardly
Not such a good vs evil issue. Zika virus,rape, domestic violence and threats to mother's life muddy the waters. Think!!!
if you're pro life then be pro refugee! Hypocrite!
your silence on the #muslimban speaks volumes for your RAGING hypocrisy and cowardice.
You are not pro-life. You are pro-forced-birth and that is EVIL. We're coming for your job. Just watch.
Your Tw tagline says to help you restore Constitutional leadership in Washington- what have you done? Crickets...
then I also expect you to end capital punishment
it is a women's choice not the government. To be real the fetus is not a life because it cannot sustain life outside the womb
You are not pro life but pro birth. Why not protect life with health care like ACA and Planned parenthood.
You want 'smaller government' only after you tell everyone who doesn't believe the same as you are silenced and destroyed.
Maybe you should do more to protect it and enrich it after birth.
Just so we're clear supporting life is more than supporting birth. This includes #Undocumented Life, #Refugee Life, #Muslim Life
Thank you.
choose life? Refugee children are not life? Hypocrisy!
I am grateful for the 223,000,000 Americans who believe we have the courage to choose for ourselves: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/03/about-seven-in-ten-americans-oppose-overturning-roe-v-wade/ …
You control your own uterus.. leave ours alone ok Mike?
You are GONE next election
How many "pro life" marchers have adopted any of the thousands of unwanted children n the system?  I'm pro-choice & we adopted 5
Syrian Refugees are struggling to stay alive and #MuslimBan. @NRO with the measure you use, it shall be measured back to you @VP
says man wanting to kill millions by taking away their healthcare.
I have 2 beautiful children but I also understand and have compassion for those who must make a difficult choice. #prochoice
U are pro birth, not pro life. If U were why take away health care, food stamps, & programs that benefit children? Hypochristian
when you choose life, you choose all life and that includes immigrants and muslims #hipocricy
.@SenMikeLee If we valued life we would be responsible w/it before & after birth. Abortion is not empowerment. Women deserve better options.
.@SenMikeLee Women deserve better. #LoveThemBoth #ProlifeGen

*hundreds of Americans you mean
.@SenMikeLee Legislate education at all abortion clinics. Prenatal development, risks to mom & baby, & adoption opt. #ProChoice #RightToLife
so please share your adoption story.
access to birth control decreases abortions
I've never understood Y sex ed is taboo when we only exist because of it?! How shld govt be a part at all?
Pro-choice is pro-life! Knowledge is power!
Thank you Senator Lee!
at age 62 I've adopted 2 little girls from meth/abusive parents. I've seen our foster parent system close. @VoteChoice
you don't choose life if you take away affordable health care.
It's not 'choosing life' when you take that choice away. It's forcing religious 'opinions' on strangers
Why can't it just be a choice? That way those who want to can and those who don't agre with don't. All seems rather silly
because these past 8 yrs the far left have made you believe that going against the grain is wrong
The left lmao. I have zero to do with right or left let ppl choose. Less government in peoples lives is what is needed.
the far left- n less government involved in ife is good -
Implying that the decision to have an abortion is easy.
Stop cutting funding to programs that ensure quality of life for actual children & shut your hypocrite mouths! #TaxChurchesNow
try supporting the children that are already here. You are pro birth, not pro life!
if you value life you won't support ACA repeal, right?!?
Only if you're white and conceived within US boarders and you're insured. Pro life until you're born &need help. Hypocrites.
How to eliminate abortion...Support education, safe sex education, and birth control. 

All things Republicans hate.
"the courage to choose life" So you're pro-choice?
I am grateful for the millions of Americans that have the courage to choose life: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444264/march-life-one-mothers-story … #MarchForLife
If you are "Pro-Life" Senator Lee, why do you continue to block funds to fix the water system contaminating children in #Flint? #MarchOfLies
@NRO yet you consistently cut back social services. Lee youre a phony pro-lifer
can your tiny brain not comprehend the word choice? Is that why you advocate and support taking away choices from the people you represent?
let's make sure women don't have to make the difficult choice of abortion: Compressive sex ed and access to contraceptives
.@SenMikeLee Courage is when a woman stands for her right to manage her own body. Presumption is when a man does it. #IStandWithPP

@nro @RedState the @GOP play Pro-life card for favorablity in south as south suffer under climate change sever weather.
"If you NEED an abortion you should definitely get one" Louis CK
Not an overwhelming march....
#MarchforLife2017  if we valued life the value of that life would not diminish by virtue of being born.
#MarchForLife  if we vales life we would support universal health care, equal education, we would end mass incarceration.
#MarchforLife2017  if we valued life we would be better stewards of the environment & provide clean water for Flint
#MarchforLife2017  if we valued life we would not destroy families through police brutality or mass incarceration.
#MarchforLife2017  if we valued life we wouldn't seek mass deportation of migrants & threaten to destroy families
@@SenMikeLee  #MarchforLife2017  if we valued life we would welcome refugees. We would defend Muslims against vilification and hate crimes.
#MarchforLife2017 if we valued life we would  address the causes of poverty rather than place blame and maintain the status quo
the bodies of the unborn are not conscious. Yet you want to give them a 'right' to live in a world where they arent wanted! Evil
unless that life needs health care, or is fleeing crises in nations we bombed, chased down because they helped the US military.
You want to take away health insurance from millions of Americans. That's pro-death.
You do know that choosing life = NOT CHOOSING the death penalty...? Feeding the forced births...? Healthcare when born...?
@NRO and impose their will on someone else's body ahhh the American way.
Pro-birth does not equate to pro-life. Denying healthcare, poverty assistance, access to contraception & sex education is wrong.
Choose life ? Remember that statement when the first person dies from not having Healthcare then the second etc. we will make sure you know
.@SenMikeLee I am grateful that millions of Americans have to option to CHOOSE pregnancy if they wish.

Newsflash: people who support "life" don't favor taking health insurance away from 29 million people & Trump's #MuslimBan #RefugeeBan https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/825060898003963904 …
I choose life, too-the life of the women FIRST. 74.5% of abortions are prior to 9 wks-Fetus indistinguishable as human-Grapesize
So you'll protect "the sanctity of life" by fighting against stealing health care from millions, right? #SaveACA

pretty ironic that your "March for Life" is on Holocaust Remembrance Day.  #MuslimBan #MentallyUnfit
Wonderful story of a woman having a choice. Wish my MA had that choice in '71. Instead she nearly died & was left infertile @ 32
People who are "pro life" don't vote to take away healthcare/food/housing from millions, or champion the death penalty. You're hypocrites.
I can't wait until we vote you out.
You folks don't have me fooled. Such a line of crap. What about insurance-less people, poor, muslims? Noble claptrap. #MyBody
i guess the 29 million Americans YOUR about to boot off healthcare do not matter?! #shameonyou
increase access to family planning if you want to prevent abortion!
Unless we're talking about the lives of refugee children, apparently.
New Rule: You can't say you support life when you support taking away lifesaving healthcare frm 30M people. #antiChoice #saveACA
disgusting facts about what you support after child is born though
pro life until they come out of the vagina.
What gives you the right to control women ?
With over 200,000 women raped a year GOP desire to take away their access to a legal, safe abortion is a war on women.We see you
Yes, life! Except for refugees because fuck those kids!
Are those the same that support the #ACA?
but once your beautiful child emerges, it does not deserve healthcare, right?
thank you Senator!
<--A rapist best friend.
You mean help you control women's bodies more, of course you're grateful
again
does this #Marchforlife come with healthcare, access to healthy food, good education, free speech, religious freedom?
Get your laws away from my body. It is MINE.
Thank Mr. Lee for standing for life. The carnage that the President talked isn't only about the killing in our streets.
So true. It's  also in the brains and hearts of so many Americans. #IStandWithPP
You are only pro-birth. You do not support education, healthcare or other basic services needed by children of all ages.

#MarchForLife #IStandWithPP #ACARepeal #RefugeesWelcome #ProLife #BLM #FlintWaterCrisis #gunsense #womensright 
how are *you* making abortion unthinkable for a woman? Parental leave? Health Care? Remove stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy?
pro birthers who don't give a damn about a baby once born. you're not fooling anyone
