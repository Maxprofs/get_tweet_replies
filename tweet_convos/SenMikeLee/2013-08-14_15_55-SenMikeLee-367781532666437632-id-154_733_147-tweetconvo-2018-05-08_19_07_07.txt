@SenMikeLee @VistaJake They won't cover "it" that way because "it" is manifestly false. #upisdown
@Jacksontong @SenMikeLee  Sure, and George Bush is still responsible for everything like O's incompetence -or Sharpton's asinine racism.
@VistaJake @SenMikeLee I agree with some shavings off your tweet, but @SenMikeLee is threatening to shutdown the govt.
@Jacksontong @SenMikeLee  Look around Jack, government by the people is shut down now.wake up, a tyrant and his cronies have stolen our land
@VistaJake @SenMikeLee I didn't feel tyranized under gwb even though I had more points of disagreements with him.
@Jacksontong @SenMikeLee  You have the tyranny, the dictatorship now--By executive order-- SCOTUS stooges sit idly by. Deliver us..
@VistaJake @SenMikeLee Look at executive orders in other presidencies particularly Republican.  Don't take the word of @SenMikeLee  et al.
@SenMikeLee Obama must be shut down... Impeached... No more stalling around... ACT!!!
@drciliate @SenMikeLee Impeached on what ground.  Aca is law.
@Jacksontong anything this far-reaching should have been decided by direct vote of the entire population! Obama is not a legitimate leader!
@drciliate 1. You may think so but that is nothow US govt works. 2. POTUS has won two national elections. #constitution
@SenMikeLee let it shut down then... We can survive without Obama
@drciliate @SenMikeLee We the people can survive without government-they can't survive without our $$$. We can take care of our own.
@JoAnnEileen Absolutely!
Welcome to the NFL, Senator. MT“@SenMikeLee: It's the president who is threatening to shut down government...media won't cover it that way:
It will not hurt the House @GOP to quickly pass funding w/o #Obamacare. Lay it on Reid's desk, then say "your ball" @brithume @SenMikeLee
@cyamas @GOP @brithume @SenMikeLee Gridlock is a reasonable response to a divided people.  A tied score isn't the same as a loss.
@jskrepak @GOP @brithume @SenMikeLee oh, I see. I guess you're agreeing.
@cyamas @GOP @brithume @SenMikeLee Yes
@jskrepak sorry. Slow on the uptake sometimes :-)
@cyamas Still friends anyway.
@SenMikeLee @lovusa4 Bravo to Ted Cruz. It's nice to see a "real man" on Capitol Hill, isn't it?

@LFS7 thank you for saying that, but I don't think so. It's heartening to know others think so, though.
@welshman007 never second guess yourself budy you are doing great work for Americans.
@SenMikeLee Sir, how is that? ACA is enacted, SCOTUS approved, and referendumed.  You will "not blink" until it is defunded?
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty as a #FrederickDouglassRepublican we believe in respect 4 the Constitution !
@SenMikeLee @VistaJake Mike you, I and the rest of the US knows Boehner will Fold like a cheap lawn Chair. Yet NO ONE on Gop will remove him

@SenMikeLee Obama directed the Office of Personnel Management, which has no power to apply change to the ACA law. Repeal this change
@SenMikeLee @gelinorb  Newt wouldn't let MSM get away w/ that crap, But some how you guys do. Grow a spine!
@SenMikeLee Every single Republican when interviewed should preface their answer with correcting the question.
@SenMikeLee that is THE most frustrating part about this and the fact that many republicans are half-assing the answer isn't helping.

@SenMikeLee @EmfingerSScout Exactly right.  So why are all the Repubs I see interviewed say they are "willing to shut down the government?"
@SenMikeLee @EmfingerSScout OBAMA IS A DESTRUCTIVE FORCE.
@SenMikeLee You along with @SenTedCruz are very unethical individuals who are self serving. U want to keep us 1 illness from bankruptcy
@SenMikeLee NO....It is you and your party who are threatening to shut the Gov down. All in an effort to keep us 1 illness from bankruptcy.
@SenMikeLee let the govt shutdown! Far better choice than OCare. Libs say U obstruct? Please do! Obstruct this monstrous nitemare @tedcruz
@SenMikeLee If AUDITS are like a BIOPSIES..Then the Dems "nothing to see hear"! Is MALPRACTICE!!

@SenMikeLee - Thank you for having the guts to stand up for the people- it matters!
@SenMikeLee Senator, the response should be, the Fed Govt has been shut down before, and the sky did not fall. Dismiss & disarm media.
@SenMikeLee @coff33loveit The harder #defundobamacare is pounded on, the harder it is for the media to spin it.
Then it's time to bring in the big "Hammer"....@ysBones @SenMikeLee Turn up the heat Big Mike!
@SenMikeLee @NBC @ABC @CBS @CNN @MSNBC ARE THE PALACE GUARDS, NOT JOURNOS AND ARE MANIPULATING MEDIA AND 4GOT THEIR E.T.H.I.C.S. #boycott

@SenMikeLee - the narrative to blame congress for all of Obama's failings is already written: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/07/13/13-reasons-why-this-is-the-worst-congress-ever/ …
@SenMikeLee This Person that infiltrates the White House is a Parasite.

@SenMikeLee @paulrevered1776 We know but will the "low information voter" know? Regardless, you HAVE 2 try 2 defund that abortion of a bill.
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson Even  other Republicans are phrasing it that way.  We need G.O.P. not to join in with Media.
@SenMikeLee No, you're wrong. I always told people that you aren't that bright. #ObamaCare!
@SenMikeLee @marklevinshow #Obamacare was rewritten by the Supreme Court so Justice Roberts cld find it constitutional. Defund on this alone
Gee, projecting much? MT @SenMikeLee: It's the president who is threatening to shut down government, though media won't cover it that way.
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber Go for it. It's way overdue.
@SenMikeLee You ppl have to keep up the fight.  This man is a tyrant and a lier.
@SenMikeLee @instapundit You ALL need to be saying it's OBAMA'S SHUTDOWN everyday. Otherwise, no, it won't be covered that way.
@SenMikeLee  Obama wants to blame the Republicans for the gov. shutdown when the Democrats passed all the Train wreck Bills and laws
@SenMikeLee Win what? 30 million Americans dying because of lack of Health Care? How is that a win? I thought we should CARE for the ill?
@SenMikeLee Hillary Clinton: More deserving of occupying a stockade in Leavenworth than holding political office!  http://dcclothesline.com/2013/08/15/hillary-clinton-more-deserving-of-occupying-a-stockade-in-leavenworth-than-she-is-of-holding-political-office/ …

@SenMikeLee appreciate your speaking the TRUTH!  Socialized Healthcare is the Liberals Holy Grail and has been since Hillary was First Lady!
@SenMikeLee @usa_truth The media is not so much an arm of the government, as it is working for the same people.
@SenMikeLee Many of us want Obamacare to succeed. #doyourjob #helpamericans
@SenMikeLee Your party is scared! Hell shut the govt dwn. We will blame only GOP in 2016
Congress has duty to come up with an acceptable budget that doesn't hurt Americans. That's why they get the blame for shutdown @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee GET REAL!
@SenMikeLee @ReCorwin Get  the bastard out now, or find another job, we WILL vote you off the fence and out of office!
@SenMikeLee yeah it's not like Mitch McConnell is blocking the senate from doing their jobs constantly or anything...
@SenMikeLee Worst case scenario: they succeed. Best case scenario: they succeed. Either way THEY will have Econ on them. Ocare is a failure!
@SenMikeLee I keep saying that! All want is to defund obamacare! THEY will shut govt down to cry & try 2 pin on Repubs.

@SenMikeLee Of course the media will favor Obama. That's why I don't support defunding #Obamacare yet
@SenMikeLee Amazing isn't it?
@SenMikeLee @StephenKopan Obamacare is failing under its on weight, let the Dems own it. 2014 is crucial dont give them a point to rant on.

@SenMikeLee gdamn liberal media if you  ask me
@SenMikeLee The gov't shuts down on weekends, it shuts down on holidays. Obama is tweeting climate change on vacation. Get a better mantra.
@SenMikeLee let it shut down for a few weeks. No one will really notice just like the sequester
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks They ain't gonna cover it unless the Pubs say it! You guys need to get on the same page. OBAMA shut down the gov.
@SenMikeLee @BestRDSP He is offering to defer payments on ~25% of government. No bill will go unpaid, nor essential svc stopped.
@SenMikeLee @jonburtonhx #Sequestration was and always has been Obama's idea. He created it now wants 2 distance himself from it. It's HIS!
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Is it possible to defund Obamacare without defunding entire Govt.?
@SenMikeLee lol. The ol' "why are you hitting yourself" defense, eh?
@SenMikeLee You're just another ignorant Tea Party liar. POTUS IS NOT and WILL NOT threaten to shut down the government but GOP sure will.

@SenMikeLee It's despicable behavior if true. Just like it is when your team does it. All the time. Stop being partisan. Start representing.
@SenMikeLee We don't give a damn about the Media. The #GOP needs to Start standing up for #WeThePeople! & We will stand behind you!
@SenMikeLee I am so proud of you!  Keep standing up to power!
@SenMikeLee @PaulRyanPress @SenRandPaul @SenatorTimScott
@SenMikeLee shut it down, only way to stop the bleeding.
@SenMikeLee #DefundObamacare That's because you republicans don't work together. If you did & had daily talking points that would be the msg

@SenMikeLee  Yadda, yadda, yadda. Your "flop-doodle" is becoming so tiresome.
