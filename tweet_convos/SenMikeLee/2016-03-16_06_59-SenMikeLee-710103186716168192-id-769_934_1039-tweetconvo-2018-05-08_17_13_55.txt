@SenMikeLee @MendyWax U should resign!!!
@BeckyJohnson222 why do you say that??
@MendyWax The Constitution says it's the Senate's job to review & approve Supreme Court nominees.He just announced he refuses 2 do his job!
@BeckyJohnson222 nowhere does it say they must approve a presidential nominee! Their advice is that they are witholding their consent!!
@MendyWax @BeckyJohnson222 learn to read the constitution annd follow presidence. Many americans dont know thier ownn constitution
@MICHAELSTATEN5 @BeckyJohnson222 what specifically does the constitution say? I've posted it in this thread already, but for arguments sake
@MendyWax @MICHAELSTATEN5 It doesn't say an elected Senator can refuse 2 perform the duties of his office
@BeckyJohnson222 @MICHAELSTATEN5 and they're performing those duties!
@SenMikeLee Sen. Lee is doing his job. He advised Obama not to nominate and he won't give consent to any nomination.
@docwesley90 @SenMikeLee that is not his job. Suggest you not make up the law but read it again
@MICHAELSTATEN5 I'm not making up anything, rather liberals are. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say hearings must be held...
@docwesley90 @MICHAELSTATEN5 learn to read the constitution & presidence case law. In this subject
@MICHAELSTATEN5 I have. Liberals have avocated doing the same thing, ie. Biden in the 90's and Harry Reid in 2008. They just failed at it.
@docwesley90 actually they held hearings. You can talk all u want but you better do your job to hold a hearing on the person
@SenMikeLee thank you Senator
@BeanfromPa @SenMikeLee ...for being un-American???
@BeckyJohnson222 @SenMikeLee I think he's a patriot
@BeanfromPa @BeckyJohnson222 @SenMikeLee patriot my ass! Should be kicked out of office for treason!
@Fricat @BeanfromPa @BeckyJohnson222 @SenMikeLee. That's not your call. His constituents LOVE him 4 standing strong so he'll b staying.
@WisegalGranny  @SenMikeLee Look. U can elect any guy U want.But his JOB is 2 hold hearings,NOT announce a conspiracy 2 NOT do his job!
@BeckyJohnson222 @SenMikeLee. His job is 2 represent the voters who elected him & he's doing just that.
@SenMikeLee That is neither advice nor consent: it is the GOP punishing a twice-elected president for being both black and successful.
@HunkyGayJesus @SenMikeLee 
Children of the GOP.
@SenMikeLee   Jesus Christ you a stupid shit!
@SenMikeLee Hang tough no backing down.
.@SenMikeLee No you haven't. #DoYourJob or resign
@Ti_FusedCynic @SenMikeLee Not your call. I'm sure his constituents will be keeping him.
@WisegalGranny @SenMikeLee It affects the entire country so yes, it is my call. Move along now.
@Ti_FusedCynic @SenMikeLee. The Senator gave his answer. It's NOT going 2 happen.  So move along now.
@WisegalGranny A) get your own lines B) use them on someone else C) fuck off
@Ti_FusedCynic. Kisses
@SenMikeLee If you won't do your job Sir, please retire and let someone else run for Senate.
@GlennBackes @SenMikeLee He's doing exactly what he was sent 2 DC 2 do! We need a LOT more like him. I can't WAIT til Obama retires though!
@SenMikeLee No, you advised you would NOT DO YOUR JOB, AS you swore an oath to uphold your Constitutional duty.  #SCOTUSnominee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Honest question, Senator: will you regret this stance or change your mind if Trump is the GOP nominee?
@Captain_Strongo @SenMikeLee I remember hearing "up or down vote" demands all the time during the Bush years. #hypocrisy
Pes Trump to refer this on Twitter !! _ 
Levin PROVES Obama Wiretapping Trump | Fox & Friends 3/5/17 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91fNfGjZdM0 …
@SenMikeLee Have it your way. I hope that you're all #ReadyForHillary . I sure am.
@SenMikeLee your responsibility is advise and consent, your job is not to give any president "advice" - any 8th grade civics student knows
@SenMikeLee Damn. Racism is all you're good for  isn't it?
@SenMikeLee @Photogbill222 But but the Biden rule...... LOL can't believe that plagiarizing arse has a Senate rule named after him.
@SenMikeLee thank you for"doing your job"  we appreciate all you do!
@SenMikeLee absolutely disgraceful. You are promoting discrimination by refusing to work w/ someone who identifies with a different party.
@SenMikeLee You've failed to meet your obligations and should be impeached. Sorry.  We have a President (twice-elected).  Do your job.
@SenMikeLee Hold The Line Mike!
@SenMikeLee I wonder if you know how infantile this looks from the outside.  The American Senate is throwing a tantrum for the world to see.
@SenMikeLee that is not how the law works. The pres nominates and you vote. Do your job or we the people. WILL replace you.
@SenMikeLee @Depasquallers thank you Senator
@SenMikeLee keep that pledge and pray Cruz wins cuz I don't trust Trump to app a Conserv judge
@senmikelee your consent and advice is to go on strike on scotus?obamas term is 4 yrs not 3.DO YOUR JOBS!
@SenMikeLee  give us #twitterfolks a breakdown on the status on #scotusnominee.  Our opine is mute. We depend on U. TY #tgdn #ccot #ctot
@SenMikeLee I hope you can keep RINOS in line on this.
@SenMikeLee @coloradorebecca this life long conservative Republican will believe it when he sees you not cave like you always have
@Mikerhartmann Mike Lee doesn't cave. He's one of the few good guys -
@SenMikeLee @MattFromTexas31 
I WILL VOTE FOR TRUMP ONLY TRUMP ON WHATEVER BALLOT TRUMP RUNS ON
GOP HAS BETRAYED AMERICANS FOR THE LAST TIME
@SenMikeLee Have a hearing n vote him down this wl backfire big time Most ppl have a sense of fairness will cost u the Senate in Nov
@SenMikeLee No you gave UP your right to advise and consent on #SCOTUSnominee. With no legal argument against, #POTUS can appt. now. Thanks
@SenMikeLee: not impressed. Elections guarantee governing continuity, not an excuse to avoid governing. You & Obama were elected. #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee @oracle_ed  Mike Plez don't let BHO's SCOTUS nominees come up 4 hearing/vote-WE already see some in GOP giving in to BHO again
@SenMikeLee Because for you to actually #DoYourJob is too much to hope for.
@SenMikeLee Do the job you were hired to do and have hearings. You can always be fired next election.
@SenMikeLee Because you like violating your Constitutional Job Requirement???
@SenMikeLee Yes, but why? Because you are hoping for a better outcome for your /party/; you apparently don't care about the people.
@SenMikeLee @VengeanceIsOurs thank you Senator Lee
@SenMikeLee Excellent news! By giving your consent, the President can move forward and appoint Justice Garland!
@SenMikeLee Great! I look forward to President Clinton and a Dem Senate appointing a liberal to the SC. Maybe Obama? #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee you say "constitutional leadership" and yet you choose to ignore it when it says the pres appoints justices? Do your job plz
@SenMikeLee your own profile says restore leadership leadership IS NOT inaction Hold the vote
@SenMikeLee #doyourjob or don't accept the paycheck
@SenMikeLee love how I wave the constitution flag but only when is convenient. Do your job or resign.
@SenMikeLee you are trying to nullify the people's vote. The people have spoken and they elected President Obama. Do your job.
@SenMikeLee You are violating your oath of office to uphold the constitution. You are unfit to serve the American People
@SenMikeLee it's your constitutional duty - not to mention your J.O.B. - to work w/ the POTUS in replacing Justice Scalia. DO IT!
@SenMikeLee STOP FUCKING OVER FLINT
.@SenMikeLee No you haven't, not without a record vote.
@SenMikeLee isn't ironic Senator that your seat is up for the vote????
@SenMikeLee You & your colleagues are an illustration of a broken Congress. You're turning SCOTUSnom into an "elected" position. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @forewit We don't trust your colleagues!
@SenMikeLee do your job.
@SenMikeLee  See what happens during next senate recess? Be Open door for Obama to throw in another liberal justice. You guys are to much!
I think the best thing about this, is @SenMikeLee’s twitter bio. @ShakingStick  https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/710103186716168192 …
@timoslimo deary me, these people.  @SenMikeLee
@ShakingStick Arguably they’re “leading”. Here’s something to help with the “constitutional” bit: https://youtu.be/0EfnNUt_nwY?list=PLQcaoHLSZZPnAsFnJPCiY0nJ0xUc6S207 … @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Resign. You don't represent me. Vote no if you have to. Only cheaters change the rules in the middle of the game. #FORTHEPEOPLE
@SenMikeLee Senate as a body should discuss the nominee; not just the Judiciary Committee. All the power shouldn't be in these committees.
@SenMikeLee @cjprender that's not consent or advice. That's obstruction. Do your damn job
@SenMikeLee WHY R U NOT SUPPORTING TED CRUZ????,AS THE IOWA DEMOCRAT DOSE....
@SenMikeLee Keep up all this obstruction and you won't have any credibility left by NO-vember, either.  Fitting for the "Party of No".
@SenMikeLee please do your job, just vote him down if that's what you want, but do your job.
@TexasJew @LibertyBell1000 RTMT...   "What about us?"... http://bit.ly/1PdaVfu 
@SenMikeLee Why do you represent and legislate for only half of your constituents and essentially treat the other half as the Enemy?
@GIbuddy @SenMikeLee #Godspeed throughout your tenure.
@SenMikeLee I wonder who Hillary is going to nominate?
@SenMikeLee & his peers r depriving the people of a possible great addition to #SCOTUS 
Their actions r petty unjust and unwise #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee You make a mockery of what it is to hold elected office and NOT #DoYourJob  GO READ ARTICLE 2 SECTION 2......
@SenMikeLee you have an obligation to consider the scotus nominee
@SenMikeLee I love living in Utah, but you sir make me ashamed. You are acting like a spoiled child taking their ball home. Do your job.
@SenMikeLee #ThankYou 4 your #ConstitutionalDefense vs. #BarackHusseinObama's #Marxist-'Progressive' #SCOTUSnominee #MikeLee #TeaParty #CCOT
@jaredlaw  @SenMikeLee for #SCOTUS.
@SenMikeLee And we will vote out the vulnerable GOP senators in November. You've put the Senate majority in play. Thanks!
@SenMikeLee I'm your constituent. This is a mistake. I'm no fan of POTUS, but he nominated a smart & decent person for SCOTUS. Do your job.
@SenMikeLee have fun when Hillary nominates someone more liberal
@SenMikeLee when are you up for re-election? Curious?
@SenMikeLee Amen! Stand true!
@SenMikeLee @EvelynGarone 

I respect u & am part of liberty movement
But I support trump 4 pres
Please dont start w war on woman or kkk BS
@SenMikeLee @FernLargok Thanks senator Lee.
@SenMikeLee You think you'll get a conservative #SCOTUS nominee from Hillary? LOLOL.
@SenMikeLee @coff33loveit Fine print: Unless Hillary wins the presidency and Democrats get the Senate back...
@SenMikeLee You are acting against the principles of the Constitution of the USA. your holding a country hostage  and it will be your head
@SenMikeLee god it will be great when Hillary turns around and nominated Senator Warren for the post!!!!!
@SenMikeLee thank you for all that you are doing and I look forward to doing all I can to make sure you get reelected
@SenMikeLee @atlblog How is that advice? It's just childish refusal.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your vigilance. I'd like Ted to nominate you for SCOTUS, or at least have you as Senate Majority Leader.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Do your fucking job!
@SenMikeLee so keep taking that welfare check we pay you for doing nothing and working part time, awesome
@SenMikeLee Your voters might be that stupid but the majority of Americans are not. Do your job or get off the committee. Bum
@SenMikeLee Did we elect the President to a three-year term, or am I missing something?
Dear @SenMikeLee,

#GOP currently going up in flames and you're throwing GAS ON THE FIRE??? #DoYourJob for #SCOTUSnominee.
@SenMikeLee So you should resign if you’re not going to do your job.
@SenMikeLee I mean you haven't done your job yet, why start now, right?
@SenMikeLee What the hell does that mean?
@SenMikeLee I realize you're limited to 140 characters, but I'd love to see your justification for not having hearings or votes
@SenMikeLee @PecosRoyBean Thank you sir!!
@SenMikeLee @atlblog "please help me restore constitutional leadership" is in your bio. Helpful hint: #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee have you read the constitution? Senate is required to advise and consent, not given power to wait for a president they prefer
@SenMikeLee @doggerbank #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee @D_SMITH2401 That is no way to keep America working, sir.
@SenMikeLee @atlblog you sir do not care about this country
@SenMikeLee @atlblog Then you go against the exact wording of the constitution
@SenMikeLee @atlblog the most laughable thing Sen. Lee is you claim in your bio that you want to restore the constitution.
@SenMikeLee Tell me, do you know that you and your GOP Committee colleagues are jackasses, or are you oblivious?
@SenMikeLee @Reince  I'm a moderate GOP voter. I want to see @SCOTUSnom receive a fair hearing. Does my vote count?
I'm used to political cynicism, but this one from @SenMikeLee really takes the cake
@SenMikeLee @atlblog hope you like President Clinton's younger, more liberal nominee.
@SenMikeLee more GOP obstructionism. Can't govern, won't govern. #doyourdamnjob
@SenMikeLee @LegInsurrection Nothing like standing up & giving a big F U to the public, ah Senator. You r a huge part of problem Washington.
@SenMikeLee @Craftmastah We will see. Obama will threaten to shut down gov't and blame GOP, because they won't approve his SCOTUS pick.
@SenMikeLee Thank you! Don't pay any attention to these "do your job" people. They'll never vote Republican... or read the Constitution.
@SenMikeLee thank you! Now twist some squishy arms!!! LOL
@SenMikeLee That sets a dangerous precedent where future Senates may refuse to consider Republican nominees. Stop the gridlock! #doyourjob
You are what is wrong with this country @SenMikeLee . Try to remember you are representing ALL Utahns.
@SenMikeLee Thank you senator!
@SenMikeLee @RTHTGakaRoland-Not to ignore #SCOTUS still operating per usual. The only rush here is an Obama pretense.
@SenMikeLee so, basically you want to be the #KathyDavis of the federal government, refusing to #DoYourJob but still get paid...
@SenMikeLee thank you for finely using your Congressional powers! I mean that as a veteran and citizen of this Great land.
@SenMikeLee @TPPatriots I heard this guy isn't as moderately leaning right as they're trying to make out, he wanted guns taken in DC
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @LegInsurrection I have faith in you, Senator,  but not in the Tory wets in the leadership.
@SenMikeLee do your job
@SenMikeLee Then you are abdicating your duty as a Senator and the choice of American people who voted for this President. Leave office then
@SenMikeLee Oh just do your goddamn jobs. If you don't confirm, fine, but hold the hearings. It's why we all hired you people.
@SenMikeLee Thank you sir for DOING UR JOB!!! #DoYourJob #SCOTUS  it's also a bonus that #LibTards are losing their minds!!
@SenMikeLee You have the gall to invoke the constitution in your profile while failing to do your constitutional duty! #DoYourJob, senator.
@SenMikeLee If you won't do your job, return your paycheck, you bum!
@SenMikeLee Today's GOP loves it when people don't #DoYourJob [from not following the Constitution and completing SCOTUS down to #KimDavis?]
@SenMikeLee Did everybody on the committee do that, or just senators who are not in the last year of their terms?
@SenMikeLee Great. Then let’s hope voters in #Utah do their jobs and vote you out of office. Stop playing games. #SCOTUS
@SenMikeLee @TPPatriots So what's new. You haven't been doing your job for over three years now.
@SenMikeLee @TPPatriots Stick to the Biden Rule!! Stand firm!
@SenMikeLee @disciple96 
GOOD MAN!!
@SenMikeLee @sltrib why are you defying the constitution? #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee  Shame on you.  Please DO YOUR JOB and allow our President's SCOTUS nominee his due process.
@SenMikeLee Obstruction instead of representation -SHAME on you!!!
@SenMikeLee Why won't you #DoYourJob? UT is full hardworking people & I expect more from the officials representing a state with such ethic
@senmikelee by that you mean just 1/2 of the Jud. Cmt.  do your job!  #ridiculous #ifirefusetodomyjobigetfired #SCOTUSnom
@SenMikeLee Then you're not doing your job.  We got bigger problems than this nominee.  #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @TPPatriots Thank God! Stand fast on your word and don't straddle the fence #GOP
@SenMikeLee @TPPatriots Way to go Mike Lee! We back u 110%! Don't let our despicable POTUS do this to the AmericanPeople. We deserve better!
@SenMikeLee @RepMattKrause 
God bless you Senator, and all that are standing strong against evil. We are with you.
Stay strong and bold.
@SenMikeLee Good to know you're making 6 figs/year holding up the process.
@SenMikeLee @TPPatriots Glad to see you are taking Bidens & Schumers lead.
Respectfully @SenMikeLee HarryReid has stated McConnell will cave.
Can you assure anyone that McConnell will stand fast?
@TPPatriots
.@SenMikeLee Your pouty "No!!!" response is childish. I hope the people of Utah will decide to elect an adult that is willing to #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea Thank you, Senators. #ccot #tcot
@SenMikeLee because you are shirking your duties and are 10k times more ineffective than the former 'do nothing' Congress
@SenMikeLee stick to it
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob #GiveThePeopleAVoice advise AND consent # #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee You said NO before you knew who it was, making the party look foolish. Prepare for the GOP to be stomped in November. @hardball
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator. Biden requested the same when Bush was in office.
.@SenMikeLee >Yes. #Judiciary exercises that right.. For all intent & purpose; there remains no benefit in the passing of a #SCOTUS Justice.
@SenMikeLee BOOOOO
.@SenMikeLee I support Republicans' decision to let the people have a voice in our next SCOTUS in 2016! Thank you for standing for us!
@SenMikeLee Sorry, you have given neither advise or consent. Saying you will do nothing is not advise, it is being petulant. Do your job
@SenMikeLee @RealBPhil So Lee thinks he has the authority to take away POTUS' constitutional right. Odd interpretation of the constitution.
@SenMikeLee @yrwol7 Stick 2 ur commitment Sen. Lee. We're watching!
@SenMikeLee @sassy_gramma Thank you!!!
@SenMikeLee I hope this comes back to bite you, but it probably won't because your constituents eat the #GOP nonsense you feed them
@SenMikeLee Do your job or resign.
@SenMikeLee Why disgrace yourself  and ignore the constitution?
@SenMikeLee @ScotsFyre best news I've hear all day Senator Lee!
@SenMikeLee I wish I could tell my employer I'm not going to do my job and still get paid. DO YOUR JOB!!
@SenMikeLee Then you owe us your back pay immediately! #DoYourJob #ConfirmGarland
@SenMikeLee Where's the consent? Hell, for that matter where's the advice?
@SenMikeLee You & your colleagues may want to look for other work; we're going to remove you all from office.
