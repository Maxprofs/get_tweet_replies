@SenMikeLee you're only voting on whether or not it goes to the floor for debate. #dramaqueens
@SenMikeLee Your objections will be the same regardless of the specific text of the bill. I think you can handle it.
@KABartleby @senmikelee seriously, I don't sign blank checks regardless what store it is? But I guess you wouldn't get that.
@diflann @SenMikeLee Sean you are absolutely right!  I don't write checks at a store cuz it's 2013! #LivingInThePast #GunControl
@KABartleby @senmikelee you are so witty, nice. Do you give the cashier your PIN number then?
@diflann @SenMikeLee still not how it works.
@KABartleby @senmikelee wrong, knowing what is on it is important in deciding whether to bring it to the floor.
@diflann @SenMikeLee "Oh it's already been brought'n!" ..and we all know what's in it. #BringItDontSingIt
@SenMikeLee counties are cutting law enforcement, people need to be able to protect themselves.
@SenMikeLee That was pattern set by successful passage of ObamaCare, so Dems figure "worked before" besides have years to read later
@IAMPCBob @SenMikeLee Reps need to jump start r ldrs cause if we dont get majority in Senate & keep it in House in 2014 we're screwed.
@SenMikeLee Will the idiocy that IS Harry Reid ever cease? The US Senate is run like a kindergarten class.
@SenMikeLee Senator Mike Lee says he is open to voting for the gun control bill depending on the specifics! #SenLeeSwingVote #GunControl
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee If they haven't been able to read it yet - how could they possibly vote?
@ThisIsNickSmith @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Well, they voted in #OBAMACARE without reading it. They just don't care!!
@AZ_Susan @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz perhaps it's time to vote out those who choose not to take the time to read bills before passing them!?
@ThisIsNickSmith @AZ_Susan @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Why were they in such a hurry?  What was the rush?
@bekayfranks @thisisnicksmith @senmikelee @sentedcruz To ram it down our throats supposedly without our knowing. Replace senate & House!
@SenMikeLee It is the highest form of disrespect to the American people for our reps to vote on any  legislation they have not read.
@SenMikeLee not surprising. We got sold out on Obamacare the same way
@SenMikeLee How can politicians represent their constituents when they don't even know what's in the bill?  Most are representing Socialism.
@SenMikeLee sir is it true that the 2A right is god given if so that would mean congress cannot take it away or change it ,
@SenMikeLee Let's hope everyone reads it before they pass it w/amendments. #Reid needs to be replaced. Hope the REP take the Senate in 2014.
@SenMikeLee Just like ObummerCare, you'll have to pass it to find out what's in it.
And then it will be too late.
So don't pass it!
@SenMikeLee So we do not have an opposition party then Senator Lee and the constitution can be amended with up or down votes? #tcot
@SenMikeLee Of course you have to sign it to know whats in it Thank you Nancy ( retard) Pelosi
@SenMikeLee God, he;p America, even tho we don't deserve it! Amen
@SenMikeLee then why r u voting? Why not protest this BS nonsense? Did u vote having not read it?
@SenMikeLee -this is assanine and a gross malfeasance. Stripping more rights from us?
.@SenMikeLee .Just Say No.
@SenMikeLee wtf???
@SenMikeLee 
What is going on in our Country?
Do Senators who voted on this know what is constitutional?  I think not.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Fact: Senate was voting to allow debate to begin on a Bill, not voting on the Bill itself. You should know this!
@SenMikeLee This is not a valid government of the people.
@SenMikeLee "The Senate is voting now on a gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read yet."  No threat of gov. tyranny THERE!
@senmikelee @selenabridenbec This is not a Republic anylonger. The @GOP is dead.
@SenMikeLee Ironic- people voting for leaders they knew nothing about is what got us here....
@SenMikeLee You never sign anything you haven't read. Why should voting be any different?
@SenMikeLee yes
Thank you Patriot. Americans stand with you. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee nobody voted for the bill.  This opens debate.  Or did you not have time to read the rules of the Senate either?
@SenMikeLee Here remind your fellow Senators on other side why gun registry isn't a good idea…http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/highway-patrol-gave-feds-missouri-weapon-permits-data/article_266b644e-a235-11e2-a8e7-0019bb30f31a.html#.UWdTCxBxPN0.twitter …
@SenMikeLee I'm 3001
@SenMikeLee How can that be legal?Shame on you @SenToomey,@saxbyChambliss,@senjohnmccain @deanheller Didn't you learn anything from 0'care
@WrightWingPilot @SenMikeLee @SenToomey @SaxbyChambliss @SenJohnMcCain @DeanHeller you work for the people, grow a spine, cowards!
@SenMikeLee 
Sounds like Obamacare all over. Have u not learned thing? 
I have a bill pass it and I will fill in later..
Call it Jim's bill
@SenMikeLee Sounds about par for the course these days in that chamber.
@SenMikeLee You guys should never vote on anything you haven't read.
@SenMikeLee They dont want to consider it; they just want to pass it and run.
“@SenMikeLee: The Senate is voting now on a gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read yet: http://ow.ly/jY8Dx  #Protect2A”
@jimheinzman @SenMikeLee If you can't read it how the HELL can you vote anything other than NO! We the people should also be able to read it
RT @SenMikeLee: The Senate is voting now on a gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read yet:
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul It should be against the law to vote on a bill that HAS NOT been read. #seriously
@SenMikeLee Because they are complicit
@SenMikeLee http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/9/second-amendment-supporters-start-sandy-hook-chari/ … Help us spread the word!
@SenMikeLee Please, NO "expanded" background checks until EVERYONE can read and understand the language...
@SenMikeLee What kind of a #FOOL would vote on a law without knowing fully what the law contains and the enforcement thereof ?
@SenMikeLee There is NO transparency with anything in the Admin. I'm tired of all the secrecy put forth by the Dems & Obama in the past 4yrs
@SenMikeLee The guncontrolbill hv bn N UR office 4 at least 4 months; I am so tried of being ashamed of y'all I am a Texan let's do LBJ now
@SenMikeLee 
What can y'all do to protect our freedom

Why r there turncoat repubs that don't
#FightForFreedom
@SenMikeLee The Nancy Pelosi effect seems to have taken hold. It's fair to say, constitutional jurisprudence has been defeated by the left
@SenMikeLee Yes, because that worked out SOOO well with Obamacare.
@SenMikeLee We will fight every republican that votes for this bill in their next primary.  We will not forget, we will not forgive. #NRA
@SenMikeLee It's what the Dems do. Cram bills down our throats that no one has read because they know it will not be supported.
@SenMikeLee thank you for standing up for our rights. tennessee needs our own lee,paul,cruz please
@SenMikeLee @Yowan just to let u know it be more surprising & newsworthy if bills WERE read. Save your time; nobody thinks bills get read.
@SenMikeLee They only voted to allow the bill to be debated on, as the American people are demanding.
@SenMikeLee  Then the obvious vote is NO.
@SenMikeLee and 16 turncoat republicans are foaming at the mouth to help the dems steal our rights...
@SenMikeLee : Remember Nancy Pelosi, "we have to pass it to see what's in it".  Yeah, right.  Thank you Senator for watching out for us.
@SenMikeLee  haven't u heard about the fog trouble. Seems to happen a lot with the democrats.
@SenMikeLee INSANE. Not about 2nd Amend. All about totalitarianism, and the Second Amendment!  NO COMPROMISE!
.@SenMikeLee thanks for trying. Most others in the senate don't respect us or think we have the right to know what they r doing to us.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  DO ALL YOU CAN FOR US. AND WE'LL WOTK ON FIRING THE RINO's B4 ITS TO LATE #opslam #tcot http://wwwwakeupamericans-spree.blogspot.com/2013/04/list-of-how-members-votedsenate.html?m=1 …
@SenMikeLee Please let us know the Republicans that vote for this. We will be like the guy from NY that had his firearms taken. Wrong guy.
@SenMikeLee you lose all leverage in an argument when you do exactly the same wrong that was done to you... See OBamacare!
@SenMikeLee That's" par for the course" these days, isn't it? Generations will look and wonder how we could let thus happen.
@SenMikeLee I think the trick is to spend more time reading and less time filibustering.
@SenMikeLee You’re right, the senate is ridiculous!  Kick those goofballs out of washington!  Oh wait…
@SenMikeLee And did you plan to filibuster a bill you hadn't read?  This doesn't look good for you Sen.
@SenMikeLee What are you taking about?  I've read accounts of what is in the bill and how it is different from current law.
@SenMikeLee shades of oblaber care
@SenMikeLee Shame on them! This is why no one trusts politicians anymore.
@SenMikeLee here we go again with this BS! read the bill and let the ppl know what yall have. Just because a few legislators agree,
RT @SenMikeLee: The Senate is voting now on a gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read yet: http://ow.ly/jY8Dx 
@SenMikeLee No, they are voting on cloture. (which now has passed) http://fxn.ws/10Op0c1  Also see:  http://1.usa.gov/cRcMcz   ru confused?
@SenMikeLee THIS is how business is done in DC. Sad...
@SenMikeLee This statement is misleading. You didn't have the Manchin-Toomey provision that will be an amendment. Had the bill since 3/21.
@SenMikeLee New rule: Anything passed without being read by a majority, is nullified. Retroactively. Starting with Obamacare.
Just vote 2 pass it first and then we will work out the language later, oh and maybe read it ... NO

@whitehouse @congressblog @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee shouldn't that be a cause for an uprising?? Why the crap do we have a bunch of retards running the country?
@SenMikeLee ok so the heads spin on that one .. no more other cheek bro.
@SenMikeLee Thank you! I liked how Harry said he'd keep Constitution in mind.Scream
@SenMikeLee  I'm tired of Reid and his cronies idea that a bill has to b passed b4 it gets read. #NOTCOMMONSENSE
“@SenMikeLee:voting now on gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read http://ow.ly/jY8Dx  #Protect2A” then vote no always!
@SenMikeLee how on earth are such sleazy tactics allowed?
@SenMikeLee Looks like it is time to #standwithrand for another lesson in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Should be fun.
@SenMikeLee sounds familiar..didn't Nancy Pelosi famously say you need to pass the Affordable Care Act to be able to find out what is in it?
@SenMikeLee Stop the Bill and read it!
@SenMikeLee How can you vote on a bill you haven't READ?
@SenMikeLee that is the blind leading the blind. #stupidity
@SenMikeLee demand they give you all a copy of the bill. Just like Pelosi said...have to pass Ocare to know what's in it and now look! wrong
@SenMikeLee Well duh. Nancy Pelosi has already addressed the issue of passing a bill to find out what's in it. Don't you listen to her?
@SenMikeLee Another you have to pass it before you can find out what's in it deal? Fool me once.......
“@SenMikeLee: The Senate is voting now on a gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read yet: http://ow.ly/jY8Dx  #Protect2A”
@SenMikeLee Just like the Affordable CommieCare Act. Just pass it first, then read what's in it later.
@SenMikeLee Let The People Know when its time for them to come to washing to Help you guys get it done
@SenMikeLee Just like Obamascare when it was rammed down our throats!
@DebraPianalto @SenMikeLee exactly
@SenMikeLee i would be appalled but 2 be honest this is 2 be expected of our leadership. Thank you and @SenTedCruz for fighing 4 reason
@SenMikeLee Again? Do your job! Read before voting!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Can't you demand time to read it?
@SenMikeLee I don't think the majority of elected can read
@SenMikeLee Senate has NO AUTHORITY to abridge Constitutional Rights
@SenMikeLee Again? I propose a constitutional amendment. All Bills must be read & understood before a congressional/senate vote is allowed.
@SenMikeLee That's how they voted and passed ObamaCare.
@SenMikeLee idiots in #congress thank u for trying. Emotional voting is bad for this country. #GunRights Criminals no background checks
@SenMikeLee - How on earth ca u guys vote on something u haven't been allowed 2 read? What has this country come to?
@SenMikeLee Like they'd read it even if they did have time?
Sorry, I thought they were voting to *debate* the bill. What are you afraid of? @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenJohnMcCain #Protect2A
@SenMikeLee they did this with obamacare it needs to stop!
@SenMikeLee I hope they remember the last time they did that!
@SenMikeLee fillabuster now
@SenMikeLee How does Government continuously get away with this? Where is the backbone of the Republican Party?
@SenMikeLee NEED TO READ THESE DAMN BILLS
@SenMikeLee Bills to vote on without substance creates total lack of respect for our government.
@SenMikeLee Then put a stop to it.  The people should be able to read and understand any and all bills before they come up for vote.
@SenMikeLee gotta pass it to know what is in it.. Vote NO!
@SenMikeLee which means they are complicit in this farce or dishonest/stupid if they vote for it.
@SenMikeLee OUR 2ND AMENDMENT IS NOT UP FOR A VOTE!!
@SenMikeLee Same Ole BS going on I see.
@SenMikeLee God help us
@SenMikeLee With all due respect Senator, how many bills that you vote on DO you actually read?
@SenMikeLee Our gov't proves everyday that is has become dysfunctional
@SenMikeLee America should throw out any SOB that votes before reading this bill. @Talkmaster
@SenMikeLee @NRANews how the hell is that even possible? Let's fix that instead of a nonexistent "gun show loophole.
@SenMikeLee Isn't this the same thing they did w/Obamacare?  We'll find out "later"?  Please.  Stop the madness.  Use some common sense.
@SenMikeLee This is Obama's way of saying that our Constitution & Bill of Rights don't exist in his eyes.
@SenMikeLee filibuster it.
@SenMikeLee Explain this one,  @TheDemocrats? This is your #bullshit.
@SenMikeLee How are they planning to expand Bkgd Chk, Online purchases NOW only go to FFL's. FFL's do NICS- B4 releasing to buyers.
@SenMikeLee pass onto the fools that vote yes that is a violation on their oath which falls to be treason
@AntDeRosa Either way, @SenMikeLee isn't the leadership of the Senate committing a fraud on the American ppl and therefore a crime?
@SenMikeLee are you, @SenTedCruz and @SenRandPaul going to filibuster this bill? #Protect2A #2A
@azlibertarian76 @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul If cloture motion wins then no filibuster. #Protect2A
@SenMikeLee Sounds like the same tactics that were used to ruin the HealthCare system.
@SenMikeLee Is this how we legally amend the Constitution? The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. Unclear?
@SenMikeLee Is it a true vote, or a vote to debate the bill?
@SenMikeLee Unconstitutional and illegal the citizens are demanding action
@SenMikeLee vote NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee FILIBUSTER
@SenMikeLee don't vote!!!Demand you have chance to read it!!!
@SenMikeLee  Imagine that...
@senmikelee I think we all know how well that worked for us the last time #tcot
@SenMikeLee how is this constitutional?
RT @SenMikeLee The Senate is voting now on a gun control bill that senators haven't been able to read yet: http://ow.ly/jY8Dx  #Protect2A
@SenMikeLee Seems on line with Ferret Faced Reid's normal MO. HE SUCKS & SHOULD BE ARRESTED but he is teflon coated in his tyranny
