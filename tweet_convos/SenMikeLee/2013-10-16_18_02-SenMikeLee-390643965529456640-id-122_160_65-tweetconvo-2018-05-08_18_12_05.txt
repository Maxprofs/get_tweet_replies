@SenMikeLee @pursueliberty #Obamacare wasn't meant to work, it's meant to destroy America, http://changingwind.org/index/news.php?extend.260.2 … #OpSLAM #TeaParty #TCOT
@SenMikeLee Stand firm we will bring McConnell home in May!  Then send you another conservative in the fall. @mattbevin #DitchMitch
@SenMikeLee @royparrish It's just going to implode ON ITSELF and when it does you and @tedcruz can say ' I TOLD YOU' #Patriots #tcot 2014
@SenMikeLee @royparrish so you cant defund Obamacare/go after IRS & target the youth with ads because without them Obamacare will implode
@SenMikeLee thanks for the motivator you polygamist fuck
@SenMikeLee @pursueliberty Correct. Because Obamacare is meant to erode America's recovery, a persistent Progressive check on private wealth
@SenMikeLee if people wanted ACA repealed Mitt Romney wouldn't have lost by 5 million votes. Quit taking the country hostage
@SenMikeLee @cath1423 @SpeakerBoehner caved.  He has nobody to blame but himself for his upcoming political demise.
@SenMikeLee Medicare didn't Bcome what it is 2day overnite & u won't B voted out of office overnite-Like a fine wine great things take time!
@SenMikeLee actually it kinda was...
.@SenMikeLee unfortunately #entitlementprograms don't die. They morph into huge cancers on society. #DefundObamacare #HarryReidsShutdown
@SenMikeLee Thank you so much to you and Senator Cruz for fighting for the American people, never ever give up or quit.  Stand on principles
@SenMikeLee why didn't you say this on October 1st. You wouldn't look like such a big douchebag tonight. #16daysfornothing #ShutdownOver
@SenMikeLee What happened to the "replace" part of Repeal and Replace?  Where are the Republican ideas?
@SenMikeLee Obama care was created long before Obama became president, a complicated structure like that doesn't appear out of thin air.
@SenMikeLee I appreciate you not allowing defeatism to take over...many said the British would never give over the U.S. We can't give up!
@SenMikeLee the 2nd Amendment is 222 years old and many still want it repealed, I do not!  I hope it doesn't take 222 Years for Obamacare
@SenMikeLee @amandacarpenter "For example, my House colleagues have tried repealing it 40 times already! I would counsel patience."
@SenMikeLee Will it be repealed IN TIME?  Prayers for AMERICA - 2 Chronicles 7:14 - Joel 2
@SenMikeLee B4 u repeal ACA, please have a plan 4 uninsured, disabled folks who need medical care, can't get insurance under current system
@SenMikeLee But it can break us almost over night.  Then it's too late, no one will even care about it in the rest of the anarchy.
@SenMikeLee @ElishaNEWS SUPREME COURT SAYS IT IS TAX.CONGRESS WRITES TAX.JUST REPEAL!
@SenMikeLee Thanks for standing for what's right despite the price you're paying.  2014 may bring us more strong voices as a result.
@SenMikeLee keep voicing the mess when the smoke clears it will be obvious who was working for the people and who was supporting a dictator.
@SenMikeLee  Obamacare is here to stay; Sorry I cant say the same about you; Start Packing!!!
@SenMikeLee ,Steve &Randall, it was 100 yrs in the making & the vote was quick. We stand with you Senator Lee. This fight isn't over.
@SenMikeLee keep fighting. We need to get rid of the cowards in our party and replace them w / mike lees & ted cruzs who will fight 4 us
@SenMikeLee Than you Sen, Lee!
@SenMikeLee you won't repeal it in 2014, & you won't repeal it in 2016, less you damage the economy again in hopes of wresting control of WH
@SenMikeLee there are many ways to skin a cat.don't give up, please!
@SenMikeLee Reality Check: You've destroyed the national GOP brand & ensured the election of a Democratic POTUS in 2016. #dreamon
@SenMikeLee it's like every other social program once enacted, it will never be repealed
@SenMikeLee sincere thanks for the fight you and cruz put forth. Dont give up! Thanks
@SenMikeLee keep up the fight. Millions are supporting you, Cruz, DeMint, et. al
@SenMikeLee I appreciate what you and @SenTedCruz  attempted to do. Hopefully we get our country back someday.
 #30piecesofsilver
@SenMikeLee I just want to say a big THANK YOU for standing with us and fighting to save our country.
@SenMikeLee The delusion is not diluted.
@SenMikeLee , if you cave now its over. Dems don't think they have bad ideas... Only good idea w/o enough funding.  You quit... ACA stays
@SenMikeLee The FederalReserve has yet to be abolished & it's the biggest scam going. It's lasted 100yrs + or - &the #1reason for this mess.
@SenMikeLee #teaparty keep up the fight. looking forward to another 2010, but even bigger for 2014.  praying 4 ur strength n leadership thx
@SenMikeLee ...but it is certainly moving forward.
@SenMikeLee @amandacarpenter u won't be there if it happens
@SenMikeLee Stand strong. You are the future of this party if it is to be saved.
@SenMikeLee God Bless you and Sen Ted Cruz for all you are doing. Behind you men 1000%
@SenMikeLee  Need to defund it before it gets going.
@SenMikeLee once started Democraps will keep pouring $ into Obamacare until they declare it a success.  Hoping it fail on it own is foolish.
@SenMikeLee Or ever.
@SenMikeLee. At some point the Republicans have to look Obama in the eye and say, we are willing to default on our debt to save a nation
@SenMikeLee #cspanchat You would be much more persuasive if you had a well-thought-out alternative to address American Healthcare debacle.
@SenMikeLee fight for your convictions. Now is your dare to be great moment #holdthedamnline
@SenMikeLee Take your point, but it was passed overnight. In the dark when the country was not engaged. Your efforts deserve much credit
@SenMikeLee No matter how you slice it, you're still awful.
@SenMikeLee Thanks.  Hang in there.
@SenMikeLee Better get on the horn with all your house buddies and send this thing back. We have been patient, but patience is running thin!
@SenMikeLee OCare  was designed to fail-praying you and other Conservatives will be able to block single-payer system & save healthcare!
@SenMikeLee for @GOP  Vice President !!
@SenMikeLee We will keep fighting and standing with you and @SenTedCruz. The American ppl know who is on their side. Thank you. #ncpol
.@SenMikeLee ACA was approved by Congress, signed by the pres and declared constitutional by SCOTUS. Obama was reelected in 2012. Give up.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for taking a stand and continuing the fight.
@SenMikeLee Get over it. Everyone's getting access to healthcare in a relatively conservative fashion. Stop wafting my money and Move. On.
@SenMikeLee @amandacarpenter yeah and trying to defund it was pure stupidity.  Interesting how the goal posts have moved so much.
@SenMikeLee I am so proud of you & Sen Cruz. Wish the rest of the Republicans didn't cave.
@SenMikeLee @Hsquared_Studio Since you and Cruz are joined at the hip, I'm surprised to see a pic of you without him alongside your head!!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Thank you for all you do. You give some hope that we may someday restore this once great nation.
@SenMikeLee keep up the good work
@SenMikeLee ...you did your best but bottom line...Republicans lost and look weak and cowed...Democrats are doing a happy dance...
@SenMikeLee #Obamacare was passed in the middle of the night, behind closed doors, in secret.
@SenMikeLee "In Washington, victories are rarely immediate & very few are permanent."

And huge failures like yours have multiple returns
@SenMikeLee @pw1331 Romney would've repealed through executive orders. But he wasn't "conservative enough" for the right wing.
@SenMikeLee keep fighting the good fight. Plenty of people behind you!
@SenMikeLee Thanks for your efforts & we're counting on folks like you and @SenTedCruz to help dig us out of the hole!  #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Definition of Obamacare: Replaces best medical service with worst due 2 overloading resources by those forced 2 buy so use more
@SenMikeLee Obamacare won't be repealed until the dollar is collapsed and this debt deal is a large step in that direction
@SenMikeLee Statement thereby assures the American people will be here again and again because the GOP will not move on.
@SenMikeLee so in the meantime we suffer.... thanks for standing up for us, we need more men like you and Sen Cruz
@SenMikeLee it was made law overnight and nobody read it.
@SenMikeLee umm. Hasn't your ilk been trying to repeal this for the past two or so years? You're a failure and waste my tax money.
@SenMikeLee @amandacarpenter Thank you for fighting - please kick RINO's in the ass for us.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Y bother fighting if ur just gonna throw in the towel @ the end?  #WeThePeople deserve better! #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Is it true Senate bill will effectively transfer more spending & debt ceiling power to executive branch? Someone address this!
@SenMikeLee I am so very proud for your hard work  the lies will always show thru but as you said wtp have the finsl word!!
@SenMikeLee hopefully it does get repealed.
@SenMikeLee Sir it would be easier if rino republicans wouldn't leave you hanging and stood with you Cruz and America
@SenMikeLee bull,stand your ground and keep pointing to what's wrong. Low info voter will catch on. 
God bless
@SenMikeLee I hope everyone is listening to you tonight!  We're all pissed by we can all do something about!  Unite, stand & fight!
@SenMikeLee Be smart America, know your politicians, vote out Rinos, vote smart in the future!  Lee, Cruz, Paul, Hill, Rubio the up & coming
@SenMikeLee  Thank you for being a big man in life. My dad always said there are big man and small men and it has nothing to do with size.
@SenMikeLee we are with you Senator. Keep on fighting.  The liberals will not take this nation from us.
@SenMikeLee What happened to replace? Where's the GOP plan to help cover Americans w/ preexisting conditions? #NoGOPAlternative
@SenMikeLee How did you vote Senator?
@SenMikeLee Actually, Mike, Obamacare was enacted overnight, but I get what you mean. Thank you for your service.
@SenMikeLee Name one social program the Democrats have gotten and it's gone? None that's what we won NOTHING
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your efforts.
@SenMikeLee don't give up..we are with you
@SenMikeLee it won't be repealed ever but it will be tweaked. All you Tbagggers will pay a heavy price for this little tantrum
@SenMikeLee “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” #quote
@SenMikeLee the fight is just started
@SenMikeLee we will never give up, the people are just rising. And we know we can outsmart them.
@SenMikeLee   save yourself
@SenMikeLee thanks for fighting.
@SenMikeLee Is this true?

$2 Billion Sweetheart PAYOFF to McConnell for deal?

http://wfpl.org/post/mcconnell-reid-deal-includes-2-billion-earmark-kentucky-project …
@SenMikeLee Do not give up.We the people are behind you
@SenMikeLee Or in 48+ attempts.  Feel free to stop anytime...
@npv708 Yeah - left tried for 100 years and finally rammed thru a disastrous bill no one read in the dead of night on Christmas Eve. #fight
