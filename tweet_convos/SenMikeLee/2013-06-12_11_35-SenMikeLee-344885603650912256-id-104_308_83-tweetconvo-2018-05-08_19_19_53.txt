@SenMikeLee Amen!  Keep up the courage to do right.
@SenMikeLee @777DB Or we just need to enforce the laws already passed, build the wall & enforce the consequences of coming here illegally
@suzieqolden @777DB @SenMikeLee what? That makes too much sense!
@Shannonw65 @777DB @SenMikeLee God forbid we ask for common sense! While theyre at it they should #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin Need to enforce current laws & quit worrying about being re-elected.
We don't need immigration reform. We need enforcement of existing laws. @SenMikeLee @katadams14
RT! RT! RT! RT! RT! RT! RT! “@SamThiessen: We don't need immigration reform. We need enforcement of existing laws. @SenMikeLee @katadams14”
@SenMikeLee Why don't any other legislators get this? By default; a law so large and incomprehensible is bad policy.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce No bill should exceed 10 pgs! Constitution 1pg bill of rights 4 pg the rest of it is pork and nonsense!
.@SenMikeLee is making border security a priority. Step by step is the way to go on #immigration reform.
@Heritage  @SenMikeLee Unenforced new laws are just as ineffective as Unenforced current law. IT'S THE LAWLESSNESS, Stupid! Power2StateLeg
@SenMikeLee @lambodiablo91 <> I disagree, Sir!  We just need to enforce what we already have on the books! #CCOT #TCOT #TeaParty
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin Get rid of A/C in Federal offices. That'll kill 1/2 the bureaucracy in a week.
@SenMikeLee  @SenTedCruz most LEGAL immigrants like me DO not want TO PAY FOR THE @marcorubio'S AMNESTY BILL @KLSouth @jjauthor @KatyinIndy
@SenMikeLee We need deportation and border closure to stop furthering economic destabilization
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry  what is best for the parties not the people. Same reform crap Ted Kennedy gave us in the 80's More illegals no fence
@intensejava @SenMikeLee  It won't be border crossings anymore it will be opening the flood gates.
@Lrihendry @intensejava @SenMikeLee   ENFORCEMENT first - why is there such a hurry on this when we have more important stuff
@SenMikeLee Just another way to have no immigration reform that's all your saying!
@SenMikeLee @SamThiessen we don't need any more 1000 page bills for anything. They never work out, create mass confusion, and kill jobs
@SenMikeLee We also need legislation for time to debate the legislation after it's read. Washington is KILLING us!
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Can't use reason against inverse morality legislation. IML circumvents the constit for a purpose: repartiation.
@SenMikeLee @777DB why reward bad behavior when those who do it the right way wait years?
@SenMikeLee @PolitixGal http://www.examiner.com/article/the-gang-of-8-immigration-reform-plan-must-be-rejected …
@SenMikeLee We need you & other senators who care about this country to DEFUND OBAMACARE.  We do not want govt healthcare!
@SenMikeLee @PolitixGal   Senator Lee we need enforcement FIRST
@SenMikeLee Resign from the Senate you ignorant bigot.
@SenMikeLee @ReCorwin enforce present laws
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin We need to enforce existing law.
@SenMikeLee What we need is legislation requiring time to read bills before they're passed.
@NationOfAtooi @SenMikeLee States should be allowed to review the completed text of any bill before passage in either House or Senate.
@OnalaskaGarry @SenMikeLee I couldn't agree more. Exactly my point.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce They r gonna charge tax payers for that of course.. It is not about helping people Its all for political reasons
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce I heard some agencies are renting apartments for anyone who says they are fleeing from the Democrat Drug Cartels
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce The #Democripts desperately want those votes for Hillary in 2016. Don't let them destroy America please!
@SenMikeLee I pray for that too!!!!!
@SenMikeLee We need a similar list of House Members on http://defunditnow.com  to contact and to know who stands with us to defund #ObamaCare
@SenMikeLee @wentworth8022 No bill should exceed 10 pgs! Constitution 1 pg bill of rights 4pgs all the rest is pork and nonsense!
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce We need to enforce the laws we already have~!
@myshaela @SenMikeLee True, One step at a time. #Patience
@SenMikeLee listen the MAJORITY that means MORE OF voted for President Obama your efforts are null and Void!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/312727-shutdown-looms-over-#obamacare … #TrainWreck END IT! GREAT WORK!! … … | http://ekklesiafoundation.org.uk/Blog/Santas_Bl 
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce We MUST secure the border before any amnesty. Stop this insanity.All conservatives have are you &2 other senators
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce All Bills authored by Dems have a high degree of Vagueativity!
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Purposeful vagueness can be summed up in a word coworkers & I coined while working in Gov't: 'VAGUEATIVITY'!
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 Why do we nd reform? BC pols decided not to enforce the law? You are bigger than that sir! Enforce current law.
@SenMikeLee @DebraPianalto Should Start with internal enforcement.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Why don't we start with enforcing the laws on the books.
@SenMikeLee Actually, all that need be done is to enforce existing laws. Simple.
@SenMikeLee There are few things more dishonorable than misleading your electorate & no substitute for working w/ Obama & not always against
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin We need to enforce the laws we have ..Government has never done the job..why would this time be different?
Speaking of "unconstitutional", let's see which one fits the description?  @SenMikeLee @Norsu2
@ElianaBenador @Norsu2 @SenMikeLee  Well put!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 people can apply for amnesty now & can apply for citizenship.  But we don't usually grant to criminals.
Front Door Only
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 HELLO!   Can you just enforce the law?  Could you enforce a new law better then an old law?
Punish those that hire them!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 there's no reason to make illegal aliens citizens. 
We have an enforcement problem.
We have a border problem.
Senator, words will no longer suffice. Would you not only join but LEAD a march on D.C. next Labor Day? #Regimechange @SenMikeLee @Norsu2
@SenMikeLee Hey, mean balding fatso, how about you shut your stupid mouth, instead of threatening to shut the government down! #StupidParty
@SenMikeLee What if mexicans immigrating to the USA were allowed the same property rights as Americans immigrating to Mexico? @MarkLevinShow
@SenMikeLee You and @SenTedCruz give me hope that Marxism can be turned back, stop the tide!  http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/10/Sen-Mike-Lee-Urges-Government-Shutdown-If-Dems-Won-t-Defund-ObamaCare …
@SenMikeLee Good to speak with you at Walk for Hope / Freedomworks Mike. Small individual bills - BORDER FIRST! No monstrosity sized bill.
@SenMikeLee .I hope immigrants can come from all over the world with education and skills , not just illegals from Mexico...#immigration
@SenMikeLee Not Constitutional 4 a SPENDING BILL 2 come out of the Senate~that happened with obamacare~Immigration is a PORK Spending Bill
@SenMikeLee E Verify now!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up for the United States of America!
@SenMikeLee @TimKahanek  THANK YOU for your clarity and common sense!
@SenMikeLee It's NOT that our imm. is broken...It is that they are BREAKING our imm laws. By giving them Medicade, food stamps,etc !
@SenMikeLee If Republicans pander for votes by giving amnesty. They will lose the American voter. No amnesty. No citizenship of the soil
@SenMikeLee Thank you.
@SenMikeLee Filibuster the bill to stop it! My representative Cornyn can do it and he better! He's going to end up like Dewhurst, voted out
I stand with @SenMikeLee & others to #SecureTheBorders FIRST!! #Go8 deal = DECEPTION! #NoAmnesty Keep fighting, Senator & God bless you!
@SenMikeLee @partyot Work permits for qualified; E-Verify enforced; NO citizenship for sneaking in; No waiver power@partyot for DHS.
@SenMikeLee Thank you from #TN http://bit.ly/19YjwU5  @BobCorker Cornyn lite amendment just doesn't cut it. #noamnesy #immigration
Flip this capital eclipse!...The #TIME for #ImmigrationReform & a #BudgetConference is NOW http://bit.ly/17qqAsL  @SenMikeLee @LaNOW @AJC
@SenMikeLee @bobmeyer667 How hard is it to build a fence and close the border???? That would be REAL immigration reform!
Immigration bill weighing as much as an anchor baby that people have to pass to find out what's inside=no solution @SenMikeLee @lucille_moss
@SenMikeLee @EmfingerSScout When you are right, you are right
@SenMikeLee @GOPBlackChick We need to enforce the laws we already have., NOT more laws.
.@SenMikeLee @Imadancer821 let's just enforce what we have now & secure borders. Deportation has happened under 3 other pres so that works 2
@SenMikeLee Illegals rewarded 2 b in USA but the right to b citizen & vote is absolutely wrong -- one does not just become a patriot!
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce If the bill is over 200 pages YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
#TryNot2SolveWorldHunger

@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Thanks for you Tea Party guys, the RINOs are just breathing and receiving. Keep leading please! @SarahPalinUSA

@SenMikeLee @CarolynAngileri WHY do we need immigration reform? Why can't we just enforce the laws now?????
@SenMikeLee ALERT:US DistCt Chf.Jdge Gives LeaveOfCourt 2File Motions/Docs Providing Evidence,Obamas Use STOLEN SSN# http://bit.ly/12vMfwl 
@SenMikeLee And allowing gang bangers, criminals, and DUI offenders citizenship is reprehensible! I'm ashamed of gang of 8 group! Disgrace
RT @SenMikeLee We don’t need another 1,000 page bill full of unintended consequences. We need real immigration reform
@Norsu2 @SenMikeLee there is absolutely no reason why ANY federal bill should be longer than 20 pages!
@SenMikeLee We do not need immigration reform or amnesty for people who broke the law to get into the US, CLOSE THE BORDERS!
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry we need oversight by the people not a bureaucrat.
@SenMikeLee Nice to have at least 1 Utah Senator with some common sense.  #tcot #immigration
@SenMikeLee #shamnesty Borders first, freeloaders last.
@SenMikeLee @votermom we need 2 enforce th laws we already hav on th books.  why nt try those once befor making mor that won't be enforced!!
@SenMikeLee @RedNationRising shouldn't we just pass it so we can know what's in it? #Pelosi #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 Anchor Babies are not citizens. Read 1866 congressional transcript: http://goo.gl/MPDC5 
@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 Words matter. They are illegal occupiers. They did not immigrate. All return home so we can know what legal US costs
@SenMikeLee go get them!  I'm in NJ and it's hopeless here.
.@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 WE need secure borders, competent homeland security visa clerks! CIA/FBI/NSA/DHS that actually communicate w/each other
@SenMikeLee Excellent speech! Unfortunately, the problems with the bill are so pervasive that the only hope of real reform is from the House
@SenMikeLee Thank You !  #p2 #tcot
@SenMikeLee  
Step 1 Deport all illegals
Step 2 Lock down the border
Step 3 5 year moratorium on all immigration
Step 4 Grant legal visas
@SenMikeLee benghazi, Sir.
@SenMikeLee agree with you 100%. I am disappointed with RUBIO. what happened 2him? Did he sell soul 4some power or benefit, shameless RUBIO.
@SenMikeLee @SenRandPaul @SenTedCruz Keep fighting! You have many people who have your back! Fence/Border security FIRST! Smack down Rubio!
@Cheery1 @SenMikeLee @SenRandPaul @SenTedCruz border security and enforce existing laws. We don't need more legislation!
@SenMikeLee Why not just enforce the laws already on the books?
@SenMikeLee is on top of things
