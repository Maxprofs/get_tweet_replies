@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul amen!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Shouldn't we make sure they aren't taken at all.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul  start talking about IMPEACHING OBAMA  for what he has done in destroying America
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Correction: WE must see Constitutional rights r not taken away EVER without amending th Constitution.
@SenMikeLee tell them to come and get them..but bring guns..WE WILL NOT GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT. STAND UP #rednationrising & FIGHT TYRANNY
@SenMikeLee what will it take?30.40,100 dead children?
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul Side with the people, not the NRA!!!
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul 
First, lets stop Obomba from "Bluntly" and "Forcefully" taking away our Constitutional Rights.
@wwjdtoday4u @senmikelee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul If you're against background checks, you prob couldn't pass one.
@mmmparker3 @senmikelee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul where do you come up with these assumptions MP? What does MP stand for? "Miniature Penis"?
@SenMikeLee How about just make sure our rights aren't taken away AT ALL!!! @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul -VP Bidens lack of knowledge on guns makes himself look extremely foolish everytime he speaks publicly.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Amen patriots!!!!! #tcot
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul, thanks for standing up for americans world wide.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul And we cant trust the Courts to right any wrongs Congress makes in this area as well.  So Amen!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul  then during the gun control filibuster, begin to lay out the IMPEACHMENT of obama conversation
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul http://c.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/politics-blue-collar/2013/jan/11/second-amendment-debate-it-you-must-first-understa/ …   read it!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul IMO Constitutional rights can be taken away by 2/3 state's ratification. Stop the EROSION of our rights
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Who gives these people the right to mess with our rights and theirs if they only knew it effects all.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul / casually? I think you meant "period".
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul How about not taking them away at all.  If it happens in war it is tempting to gov in peace.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul 1. Defend constitution at all cost. 2. Align the GOP/TP/Libertarians for victory in 2016.
.@SenMikeLee .@SenTedCruz .@SenRandPaul How about not taken away AT ALL. All you guys took the oath to protect and defend the constitution.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul I wouldn't say it's happening casually.  More like a foaming mouth, frantic, assault.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul you all casually make my ears bleed; least of concern is 2nd amend; u should b thankful for 1st amend.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Where were you guys when the patriot act was written!  We need more of you and less of everyone else.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul When do I get my drone?
<NEVER> MT @SenMikeLee: We must ensure Constitutional rights are not taken away casually: http://youtu.be/Adl1NdZodwI   @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul except the reproductive rights of women or our LGBT citizens. Let's be sure to limit theirs. Schmucks.

“@SenMikeLee: Univ Bkgrd Chk=Registration. Criminals don't follow the law. Shall NOT Infringe. #2ndAmendment #tcot @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul”
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul "casually"?  How about NOT AT ALL

@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul Thank u all 4 ur commitment 2 freedom.Biden & Obama swore an oath 2 the Constitution: duty dereliction
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Meaning no disrespect, but how about NEVER take away Constitutional rights.?
@senmikelee @senrandpaul @sentedcruz @eando1773 U GUYS ROCK!!!
.@SenMikeLee .@SenTedCruz .@SenRandPaul It would be much better if you made them keep their hands OFF the Constitution many have died for.
. Rights are not to be taken at all, they aren't yours to take.    @SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul
. Senators, please remember the rights are not granted by constitution (see Decl of Independence) cont
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Yep, if you're gonna take rights away, it's best to do it quickly! Because casually is too too slow.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul  Please get busy on Benghazi..
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul They aren't. You clowns are taking them away right from under our noses.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Seems like many already taken away. Too much done in the dark by those in office, and we lose.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul "casually" is not the correct word. The correct words are "at all"
MT @SenMikeLee: "We must ensure that Constitutional rights are not taken away." Universal background checks don't take away any rights.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul EVER.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Beat #Obama at his own game. Do a speech w/gun owning mothers to speak for gun rights.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul Not taken away 'casually'?  How about not at all.  Gov't has encroached way too much already.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Do a speech w/gun-supporting mothers surrounding you. Counter #Obama's propaganda/agenda.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul "Nay" is NOT a solution. A filibuster is NOT a solution. Protect people, not guns. #momsdemandaction
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Um, how about making sure they aren't taken away AT ALL?
@SenMikeLee I'll donate $5,000 to Sandy Hook families if @piersmorgan let's me destroy him in debate for an hour on his show. #BeAmerican
@SenMikeLee Please tell me "casually" was a mis-speake and you meant "without a fight" or something similar. @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Biden: "We must make sure ALL weapons of war are taken off our streets." That better include military!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul WHAT? Did Biden actually say what I think he did?
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul casually? How about not at all. #Godgivenrights
@SenMikeLee Thanks cousin. Keep up the great work! We support you!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Sirs,TY. Also,we fear not only this attack on 2nd A; but if he gets ANY movement on this, what's next?
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul How about 'not taken away'. Period.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul <---Mike Lee & company  abandoned their Oath to Office to pledge corporate loyalty to Grover Norquist.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz @senrandpaul If #sandyhook happens at Kstreet we wud hav #guncontrol within 48 hrs #tcot #2ndAmendment #nra #newtown
