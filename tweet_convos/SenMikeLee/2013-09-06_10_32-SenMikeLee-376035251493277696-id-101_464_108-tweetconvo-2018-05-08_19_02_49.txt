@SenMikeLee don't pretend like this is a representative statistic.  I know you're smarter than that.
@IAMWillBeck @SenMikeLee The war mongers need their voices heard. Get your blood thirsty brethren together and sound the battle cry!!
@josephcbeck @SenMikeLee I trust my reps to make the decision they think is best based on the info they have not on calls to the office
@IAMWillBeck the answer to chemical weapon use is trial in the Hague not bombing innocent people.
@josephcbeck opposed to war in all circumstances. I'm not. If they vote no on war I can accept that
@IAMWillBeck if they vote for and can't give us a reason, I have no reason to trust them. I can't be a good citizen and blindly trust my rep
Sen @SenMikeLee Listen please PopeFrancis @Pontifex "All men and women of good will are bound by the task of pursuing peace" #prayforpeace
@SenMikeLee @thebarbecuemast Ones who support military action should "put their money where their mouth is" & be first ones sent into battle
@SenMikeLee > Obama clearly sides with Al Qaeda & Muslim Brotherhood - that's the real reason he wants to strike Assad - to help A Q & M B
@SenMikeLee --Stand Strong - Stay out of Syria!! Not US strategic interest; inconceivable the US has all the facts:  http://shoebat.com/2013/09/11/report-assad-denied-requests-to-use-chemical-weapons/ …
@SenMikeLee Reality of What happens. .
@SenMikeLee @DefundMSM Yet your co-members like Mike Pompeo will go against those they represent to back Syrian bombing. 2014's coming.
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty And how many of them know one thing about Syria?
@SenMikeLee MUST SEE! UNDENIABLE #PROOF Al-Farouk Brigade Committed #ChemicalWeaponsAttack in #Syria http://syrianfreepress.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/undeniable-proof-al-farouk-brigade-snc-behind-chemical-weapons-attack-august-21-2013/ …
@SenMikeLee I think #Syria accepting international control of it WMD stockpile is not going to work. It will only give them cover. #Meow
.@senmikelee Nation overwlelmingly oppossed 2 this unjustified war Obama lied about Benghazi we don't trust our own Gov't Roll out HRes36
@SenMikeLee the way it is proposed makes only"Obamasense"as in no sense
@SenMikeLee NO NO NO to Syria!
@SenMikeLee People tend to lose faith in a ship captain who keeps going aground :-)
@SenMikeLee add me to the opposed.
@SenMikeLee If legislating could be done through polling we wouldn't need leaders.
@SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee @royparrish So it's really close then.
@SickOfTheKrap @SenMikeLee Yep of course it is LOL
@royparrish @SenMikeLee Obama always knows what the American people want.
@SickOfTheKrap @SenMikeLee YES indeed he does,he gets that info from NSA.
@royparrish @SenMikeLee haha exactly, President Scandal is hard at work.
@SickOfTheKrap @SenMikeLee Yep, surprising how much you can get done on the golf course.
@SenMikeLee @dpla844 Thank you Senator Mike Lee for all you are doing for America.If you happen to see my sen burr,give him a pink slip 4 me
@SenMikeLee Syria is not Like Iraq, and we should not have been there either.   Concentrate on us
CONTACT them ---> @SenMikeLee 1.2% of the constituents ...support military action in #Syria.  98.8% are opposed. http://ow.ly/oDu6Z 
@SenMikeLee Iran is a bigger threat to US & Israel, than Syria. @netanyahu
@SenMikeLee RT @motomot15 A message from a Japanese citizen, the decendant of Okinawa and Hiroshima,Nagasaki. Please do not bomb Syria.
“@SenMikeLee: 1.2% of the constituents that emailed me this week support military act in #Syria. 98.8% are opposed. http://ow.ly/oDu6Z ”
@senmikelee How many is that in absolute numbers, Senator?
@SenMikeLee You repubs fucked up Iraq by lying about it and ruined the country economically. Your credibility is zip, nada.
don't fight with Al-qaeda in syria .... vote No to war @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @mistere7777 Guess all the insane asylums are connected to the internet & they have email service...
@SenMikeLee @momisaverb 

Um, maybe that 1.2 percent of calls in favor of war simply was Sen John McCain playing with his office speed dial
@SenMikeLee Support our president its our duty
@SenMikeLee Here's my opposition http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpumfeWZu2w&feature=youtu.be&a …
@SenMikeLee  impeach Obama now
so when shall we expect the bombing to commence as the US govt never follows the will of the people. @SenMikeLee @Libertyworld
@LFS7 @SenMikeLee How can #Syria be so important but #Iran getting NUKES?! Not so much. ("And they will") :) #Hewitt #Levin #Limbaugh #TCOT
Obama is islamic employed by the Saudi Royals to promote Sunni influence globally its clear as crystal.  @Libertyworld @SenMikeLee
#Syria? @LFS7 @JacketNation @SenMikeLee "They couldn't agree on the color o' shite. It's a trap or you're blind!"
If you dont want the answer dont ask the question. @Libertyworld @JacketNation @SenMikeLee
@LFS7 @JacketNation @SenMikeLee Like, what is this, another Saudi stooge as POTUS? Worked out great w/Carter! #TCOT #Hewitt #Levin #Limbaugh
it is what it is and we are funding it; like it or not.@Libertyworld @JacketNation @SenMikeLee
@LFS7 @Libertyworld @SenMikeLee It changes the debate and it advances Muslim agenda. Congress is giving him an exit strategy.
@SenMikeLee My grandfather always said no good can come from shooting into a hornets' nest
@SenMikeLee Why weren't American lives worth sending in help for? What about Benghazi? What about border patrol agents being killed? Justice
@SenMikeLee How can Obama ask us to be there in Syria? When  Americans were being killed last year in Benghazi no help was sent.
@SenMikeLee @lcia88 Probably the same percentages as #ObamaCare  and it still passed.
@bacon4bacon not sure of% in 0-Care vote>but this regime manages 2slip&slide their way thru every Constitutional"obstacle"
@lcia88 they have no one to check and balance them, #SCOTUS #Fail,#Congress #Fail, he can run amok.
@SenMikeLee @TruckerBobS The people are roaring their opposition to bombing Syria.
@SenMikeLee @Ckirkusa  Yea for some good news. Thank you, Senator Lee!
@DavidTinnon @SenMikeLee I voted for him, I'm glad he's serving the people and not himself! #UTAH #SenatorLee
@SenMikeLee @PoliticalPieces At least 1.2% of callers were likely military contractors or....
@SenMikeLee I oppose attacking Syria Mike; this is insanity! It only helps Al Qeada.. how is this not treason???
@SenMikeLee Americans are not aware that silence on #Assad crimes means making Syrians terrorists and #cwmassacre a habit.#act2endassadswar
@SenMikeLee It should be "No" who would engage in a #SyriaWar when we have no #Strategy , firing a shot across the bow, is useless #Congress
@SenMikeLee anyone in their right mind would be AGAINST taking action in #Syria!!
@SenMikeLee Yes, but they won't listen to the 98.8% will they!
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty If Pres Obama gives the call to bomb Syria without Congress approval I expect Congress to start Impeach proceed
@SenMikeLee @1969tttt From what I've read it's like that every where.
@SenMikeLee Ask those thugs who defending Assad regime if they can stand up to him and say NO to WAR #Syria
@SenMikeLee Just remember senator most of those 98% are Assad thugs in USA take time and read there comments #Syria
@SenMikeLee Your constituents haven't seen the classified information that you have - that's why you were elected to make the hard decisions
@SenMikeLee Man Up and support your POTUS
@SenMikeLee  YES! NO! on Syria, Ocare & amnesty!! Thnks for fighing EXCELLENT fight!  Saw U @RedState.  Wld LUV to see U on Supreme Court!
@SenMikeLee @JoeTurner212 Bobo sucks, all clowns do =( grrrrrr
@SenMikeLee Thank you for listening to the American people then other senators and congressmen that only going by there own opinions.
@SenMikeLee @BobG231 Liberals think Americans are as stupid as they are. Republicans who think that way will rue 2014. You are doing good.
@SenMikeLee Vast majority of USA ppl and not only strongly oppose this senseless unilateral action. No objectives, no clear outcome. Nothing
"@SenMikeLee 1.2% constituents that have emailed my office this week support military action in #Syria.98.8% opposed. http://ow.ly/oDu6Z 
@SenMikeLee http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G_btDkPKk4 …
@SenMikeLee @RightWingNews You need  a better caliber of constituants.  Bomb the shit out of Syria and then Iran if they even look our way.
@SenMikeLee One man can become the majority if truth is on his side and his cause is just.
@SenMikeLee that's what John McCain said also, except he turns it into "they mean boots on the ground".
@SenMikeLee Solution to war profiteering?

Consider:

Open Letter
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwU9HBGzbts …

"If You want peace, take the PROFIT out of war."
.
@SenMikeLee I hope that you vote based upon your constituent's wishes.  A resounding NO!
@SenMikeLee We need to demonstrate same sense of urgency & passion for #NoSyrianWar to tell our representative #DefundObamaCare & #NoAmnesty
@Ron_GriffithsJr @JohnCornyn @PeteSessions @SpeakerBoehner @HouseFloor
@SenMikeLee Wow!  I bet that's common among your colleagues, too...#NoWar
@SenMikeLee then why are we doing this? When will Obama be stopped? Sick of him...
@SenMikeLee @jimgeraghty Impressive. I don't think you could get 98.8% of Americans to agree that the sky is blue.  #Bipartisanship!
@SenMikeLee Syria is repercussion of stink of PNAC ..world wants no part of it
@SenMikeLee I agree with those who disagree but, the damage was done years ago so unfortunately, it must go forward ...
@SenMikeLee  ... My Eulogies will be a reminder for it not to happen again.
@SenMikeLee hmm me thinks your office isn't alone.Safe to say AMERICA doesn't want to attack #Syria #UNHocusPocus #justsaying
@SenMikeLee @jimgeraghty people like your constituents are the reason there are so few people like me left in the world, Mike #jews
@SenMikeLee @jimgeraghty seems like it should be clear what your vote should be
@SenMikeLee @nicolejpearce and yet I haven't seen  @CongMikeSimpson or @Raul_Labrador even give thoughts on Syria.
@ArtNelson1 @SenMikeLee @nicolejpearce @CongMikeSimpson @Raul_Labrador Simpson been there too long. Plays safe. I fear Labrador to follow.
@SenMikeLee @jimgeraghty follows hip, not leadership.. You think it was easy for Bush to champion the surge?
@SenMikeLee \o/
@SenMikeLee #NoWarWithSyria
@SenMikeLee @C4Liberty Sounds like a no brainer!
@SenMikeLee what Congressmen saying?  has to be 70-80 % against
The REAL 99% MT @SenMikeLee 1.2% of the constituents that have emailed my office this week support military action in #Syria. 98.8% opposed.
@SenMikeLee I don't support immigration reform until fences or Syria. Don't let us down @SenMikeLee
