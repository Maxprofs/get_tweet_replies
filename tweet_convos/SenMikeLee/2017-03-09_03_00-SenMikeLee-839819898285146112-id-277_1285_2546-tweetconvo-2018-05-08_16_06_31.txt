in the long run ? Your plan does not work leave the ACA alone
youu haven't been paying attention. The ACA is collapsing. It can't survive in its present form.
Of course it can. The Republicans are killing it.
need to do some research, the ACA was designed to collapse.
I've been reading about the ACA for years. It wasn't designed to collapse. What's your source?

it wasn't always the plan. It really needed work all along. I'm man enough to admit. But this new plan is awful.
I'm waiting until it's done but so far it's horrible.
Medicaid Taxes Weekly out of our checks to pay for Medicaid Insurance wen we retired or gt sick or gt disabilty tht caused us
100% Repeal. Hire the many expects who know how to return affordable & quality care to America. @hectormorenco
Bullshit. Tom Cotton is guilty of treason and just trying to make a name for himself. #ProtectOurCare
if he makes a name for himself, it improves upon ACA and leads to better HC, the I'm all for it.
I hear you but that's my point, he didn't do any of this when Obama was president. All he did was fight against it.
He drew a line, if US doesn't get better/cheaper HC then use it against him.US needs GOP help unfortunately
RU willing to have same coverage as your constituents?24 MM+ uninsured Americans?Costs $$+? Vote NO on AHCA. We're listening and watching.
As a constituent,  can't say how proud I am on your health care stance #TrumpCARELESS #trumpcare #russiagate impeach 45 #resist
@NetworksManager  the ACA was a bad idea. Ryan as speaker was also a bad idea.
no other insrnc co gna give us health care or for free like Full Medicaid! I Want Medicaid! I Dont Want Choices!Plz help us! 
Entitlement healthcare programs and coverage for elected officials must stop.
are there any #actuarial s reviewing HC proposals? How can you provide HC for all without all paying in? @realDonaldTrump
You're such a liar! Your very words were "if this bill goes through-you fear house will lose majority!" You're a disgrace!
Get it right - not necessarily quickly!
@POTUS, jr.
Fire this man!
@freedomcaucus should have  got rid of  Ryan last time..do it right this time..Americans would support u as #FedupwithPaulRyan
@EnragedNY @RedNationRising @Hutch_USA @TeriGRight @POTUS @seanhannity  @jhbentley @RNRFlorida @RNRTexas
@RNROhio @RNRNCarolina
The #GOP is legislating and dissension is great for the process gets all the bad blood out and good law #MAGA
Aren't you going to lose a lot of support from your base when they lose health their health care?
The base will die off. That can't be good for elections.
So true. I'm wondering if maybe they're not planning on having anymore elections. 
Then why is the @GOP drive to undo anything at all Obama put in place, regardless of the consequences? @TomCottonAR #DefeatGOP to #MAGA #p2
this is about humiliating a great black man who made them feel small…
Do u read these comments Sir? How can we reach u ? Ty
not to be able to work! We cant get a job or work w disabiities n not healthy! I gt $735/month n pre-existing chronic illness
we spose to get a job wen we are disabled n get SSI/Disability? I + others who was able to work b4 becomng disabled Paid in
disappointed in you. Compromise to be part of solution not the problem. Repeal and Replace is what we expect from GOP
you better stick to what you say. DO NOT approve this death care. It will kill everyone. Better read the bill.
So the single payer system you & all your Cronies will be Shilling for the Big Club of benefactors & Lobbyists?
@hectormorenco take your time do it right. And don't forget to restore American's privacy protections. No Med data collection
finally, some common sense, if taken truthfully. SLOW DOWN. Don't screw over our most vulnerable. That's criminal.
that said, don't promote a bill that gives huge tax cuts to wealthy. We're all onto that game.
no more pickng winners & losers. "Free market" solutions. Some ntrlly will b happy some not. Cut regs! Govt OUT!
why not? Because there are clear winners and losers under this plan.
also W's & L's under ocare. Had Ind cov prvt pay & prem WAY up, lst covg 4 my girl & I bc co plld out of MO. Win?
Cotton & Con's cut out services then give Ins. Co.'s $400M+/yr for multi-million $ CEO salaries.
In the long run, this is costing an arm and a leg.  Sent people into foreclosure.  Lost their medical insurance.
Tell us WHY you're giving Millionaire Healthcare Ins. CEO's $400M/annually & taking healthcare away from poor Americans? Why?
Why don't you say ALL PEOPLE INSURED like Trump said??
Amen UR a great senator. I wish you were mine. I'm in deep blue Ct.  UR a smart and decent man with character. Bad bill
Here's a thought... KEEP Obama Care REPEAL & REPLACE TRUMP
I don't agree with u often but do re: healthcare. Even if you make 2x minimum wage u can't afford insurance @realDonaldTrump
@SenMikeLee & we want govt out of our Dr.ofc!
@O_IrishT yes totally agree let's get it done sooner the better
Ryan Plan=Failure! @potus meet w/Freedom Caucus! They have put 4th best/fairest/smartest healthcare plan4 Rcountry.
SAY IT, Tom: Repeal & Replace!!!
congress n senate don't have to worry about their medical insurance what do they care our fault for electing them
I am 63 yrs old. Under this plan I will be penalized & lose my insurance. I guess I've lived too long for the Republicans.
#universalheathcare #SinglePayer Be bold and push for #healthcare4All
@TerriGreenUSA THANK you!
you've said the price will increase, so why are you letting this happen?! Why will you vote yes?
The House won't listen, but thanks for giving them some sensible advice anyway.
***thank you***. Can we apply this same logic to our state legislature? I don't agree with you on a lot but these 3 tweets, 
@SenMikeLee Stay with it! This is NOT the bill of goods we were sold! Paul Ryan turned on us!
since when?
Yup.  Affd. HC for all.  Not repub, not dem.... All.
NO what matters is stop making citizens PAY FOR ILLEGALS/REFUGEES INSURANCE. NOT A CITIZEN, NO INSURANCE  NO MONEY, CAN'T COME
Democrats r the  problem. Medicaid is the problem.Want ALL ILLEGALS/REFUGEES 2 GET FREE PAID INS
Don't believe me check. We need to take care of U.S citizens  NOT NON CITIZENS  NO FREE LUNCH
agree obama care must go. how would you cover the poor and 11 mil added by obama care?
Will people over 50 on SSI/Disabilty (minimal $) n already getting Medicaid,lose thier Medicaid Insurance altogether?
what matters is if we as citizens are FORCED by our govt to buy #HealthInsurance . IMO, govt run care = disastrous all around.
baby, you're the best. Fight for those who cannot speak on their own behalf. Thanks!
@ThinkAgainUSA Kim Strassel "Deal" piece in WSJ is helpful clarity on the process & content particulars.
here's what your darling said
Put your vote where your mouth is.
@SenMikeLee groups would have massive bargain power. Nra group. Reward saving $ kickback some savings for using good rx
Good on you @TomCottonAR for speaking out and standing up for America! #countryfirst
And the President's. Why excuse him?
@SenMikeLee yes slow down get it right. Instead step up independent investigation on Russian/Trump attacks on US institutions.
GIVE US BACK THE INSURANCE WE HAD BEFORE OBAMACARE OR AT LEAST GIVE US THE SAME AS CONGRESS HAS.
@RedheadAndRight free market, free market, free market
thank you for showing you listened to your constituents. Just fix ACA don't repeal!
Ultimatums from rinos in congress saying this is it, all or nothing an outrage. BS. We voted for repeal, just do it!
Why do politicians think they are knowledgeable enough to screw w/ our healthcare? Republicans really want to take ownership?
YES! Thank you Senator!
when's your next town hall? Or are you going to stick to telephone town halls? #curious #screeningIsEasier
@ByronYork TRUTH!
but your plan sure as shit better actually deliver better and more affordable healthcare.
thank you for taking such a giant step toward doing the right thing for America. Thank you!
not surprising that the Cubs won the World Series before I found something we both agree on, but I'll take it.
neither matters the Senate leaders' filibuster rules that deprive my senator of power-of-majority and hence my right to vote
I appreciate your tweets but I don't believe you or the other GOP Will stand their ground.  I think you'll cave. #provemewrong
So what should be done  ?? What's your plan ?? Big Talker !!
You are SO right!  We citizens can't make our household budget decisions w/o the needed $ info , and neither should Congress.
Many Hoosier's are behind your positions on AHCA repeal and replacement. Please help stop the current proposal.
@SenMikeLee @tedcruz  @randpaul @senrobportman @SenJohnMcCain Please make the health care plan affordable for age range 50-64.
I agree with this.  I wish you actually meant it.
Thank you
What are your suggestions to fix the aca?
make them get it right.  Don't forget senior citizens on fxd income.
AND...please do not make us pay huge premiums to cover people who can't afford to pay...find some other way to fund the gap.
NJ family of 4 paying $27,000 yr very unfair! Add in 2 college tuitions...you need to make over$215k a year to survive
@Tellall2012 Why is Ryan and Co drawing up Health care bills in secret? Does he want a hug from Trump that bad?
Man, take a break. You were already my favorite legislator!
Agreed. Start over & KEEP IT SIMPLE. Repeal should ONLY repeal ACA. Replacement should give free market control of insurance.
apparently you are the republican voice of reason. Thank you.
How many days a year do they work ? $ 220,000 a year plus expenses and they can't make it to a town hall ? Ungrateful pigs
I applaud you @TomCottonAR for finally stating the obvious! 
The ACA was debated for over a year...
Why the rush?
Because @DumpTrump22 made a promise.
I didn;t that a "promise" @ADVgrrls took control over common sense & the American public!
@TomCottonAR @DumpTrump22

#Trumpcare @realDonaldTrump If the USA would gather all the single payer countries and find out how they do it..USA can follow.  Yes Follow
Amen!  Senator Cotton I hope they are listening!
Here is the deal: there are 52 Reps  in the Senate. You need 50 of them & fit in reconciliation. Get that & have what you want.
We voted for President Trump agenda not YOURS......
Did FC et al have a chance to contribute? It seems impolitic to come out after bill is released and undermine Speaker and Prez.
well the for-profit insurers would be the place you should focus on!
your job is to make it work for everyone, the ACA is not perfect but it is a much step forward compared with what we had before
please understand that not because ACA(health insurance is not a joke, not Obamacare) work for everyone it means it is a cancer
Seems GOP healthcare plan only focuses on tax cuts for their gluttonously wealthy friends & donors- very Christ like of them.
Proposal: tax top 1%, stop 7 invasions, get money from corps hiding in cayman islands, universal healthcare, full coverage. win
niiiiiice!!!!!!--a real thinker vs TRUE SOULELESS AUTOMATON BELIEVER---@MSNBC
@RestoreHistory Took you three tweets to get that out. Health care in three stages. Get on board the #TrumpTrain
GET Y'ALL SH#T TOGEATHER OR I'M VOTING FOR ANYONE BUT YALL
There's not enough votes 2 get a new bill. What R you talking about? We don't have 60 votes in the Senate. Dems will never help
you're becoming a bit annoying
I am OK with this bill.  I am not OK with starting over because you all have been yelling that you have a plan for years.
All of your jobs depend on getting this done and NOW!
It does seem like they are most eager to leave millions without insurance. Forget tax cuts for the wealthy!
#TrumpCareLyte is GOING DOWN, No one in their right mind wants this crap
what matters is you just signed up for a shellacking in the fall of 2018 messy messy messy you and Trump care
Tell Ryan that, he thinks HE IS THE KING! Even though Americans despise him and his 8 yrs of kissing ob rear.
Our President and most of our Leaders of the Republican Party have given there souls to Corporate America.
this makes me think you actually listened at the town hall. I hope that continues.  #repairdontreplace
the problem is that this should have been ready when u guys 1st presented appeal 2 obama. Now u r stalling. Do your job pronto
the tax reform is equally important. Can't you guys compromise & get it done. Congress is the most inefficient egotistical body
@SpeakerRyan why do we pay you? You have very few results & lots of excuses.  Trump works harder than any of you
Yes! Yes, and yes! We need affordable care that provides coverage!
how does it get cheaper when ppl choose not to have health insurance? Where is the help coming from? Not from fucking congress!
unsure how it is going to become more "affordable" when the extreme rich get a break and middle class gets the burden.
long run? Bull fucking shit. So short term means ppl dying, no healthcare, and filing bankruptcy until what? What long term!?
Both parties should judge any new healthcare bill this way.Better, more affordable health care 4 the public is all that matters
Shaping up that we need new leaders in both houses!
@RealBPhil we can kiss "affordable care" & quality & doctor base goodbye.
what about giving everyone the healthcare plan the Senate & House have?
@RealBPhil free market ppl had choice ins or no, Ocare created forced care vulnerabilities. Socialism sucks.
@RealBPhil chose no ins, young healthy, etc... After Ocare ppl who want/had ins can't afford $hikes n coverage. C difference?
@RealBPhil dirty little ins secret: there will always % who will b uninsurable 1way or other. B4 Ocare most of '20 million'>
*uninsured as opposed to "uninsurable."
.Finally a voice that cares about the American people NOT the political score! Thank you, @TomCottonAR.
Good for you, Tom. I've never agreed with you on anything before, but I applaud you standing up for millions of Americans!
let's ALL support this republican healthcare plan before we lose all hope of eliminating Obamacare!
But you already know that
The problem is that Trump& Ryan are trying to come up with a wealth transfer plan that they can sell as a free market plan.
Not even remotely doing what the American people want with this new bill. Why does healthcare have anything to dowith commerce?
YES - #SinglePayer, not #Ryancare which is NO improvement over #ACA. Must have a CBO score. #CareNotChaos
Ryan - "better way" = HIS WAY!! NO WAY!!!
Tom, thank you for being a voice of sanity during the repeal process.   I sure we can afford the new insurance.
a Republican exercising his muscles against his own party. I'll take it!
4. hold Insurance and care providers accountable for costs!- not the sick!!
The only constitutional federal role in healthcare is no role whatsoever.
they simply can't allow an Act with Obama in the name to stay , they are the mass uneducated and healthcare corps all lobby
At least we agree on Paul Ryan.
The deathcare bills needs some tweeking big time it favors the rich, young and the insurance companies everyone else is a loser
thankyou we do not need another festering turd of a democrat program. we need something that works for America
dropped or cut?Is Medicaid for life sustaining meds n treatment getting Dropped for us on Regular Medicaid, not on Obama Care?
mental health issues at no cost to t patient.  Tht are over 50, poor, n got pre-existing health issues ..Will our Medicaid be
Mr Cotton Can u tell me plz if people already on SSI/Disability, that are n have ben getting Regular Medicaid for physical and
Thank you for being the reasonable Republican, to speak out against ramming this through!
Do U understand what Arkansas citizens that are poor go through I have outstanding Insurance but I set beside one that doesn't?
your friends, sir, care more about proving a point and winning then they do making a good meaningful bill.
@neeratanden #Trumpcare screws older/elderly folks. One day, those are our loved ones, or us. Take a breath & check the math.
This may be the first time I agree with @TomCottonAR. In this, sir, you are correct.
I'm still suspicious. Your change of heart for the good of Arkansans on Needed #ACA smacks of fear of job loss or new backers.
What matters is getting Govt. Out of healthcare.
what matters is the plan being repealed. Then take some time for a replacement. This plan is hurting the hardworking families
Only thing that seems to matter to GOP is big tax break for rich.  #TrumpDoesNotCare accomplishes that, so House did its job. #CorruptGOP
Glad your thinking has changed since your Townhall.
your all criminals
Curious how a poor state (#45 or lower) will cope with a giveaway to the richest of the rich.
So BLUE COLLARS purchase health care letting big & small business owners off the hook AND they also get a $200k TAX BREAK? WTF
Healthcare will never be affordable for average citizens with 6% yearly increase in costs projected through 2025
wow, I'm actually in full agreement with Sen. Cotton. What a world we live in.
With ACA, coverage for your folks in Arkansas increased by 60%, better cov, lower prem's. DON'T REPEAL. Fix things that need it
@SenMikeLee We agree. We have Millinials self funding so states can cover Medicare gaps. Veterans on patrol, less traffic too.
7 years of obstructionism, bitching, tantrums and this is the best Republicans can do? More Money+Less Coverage=NOT WINNING
that's the kind of leadership you expect from a #Ranger.
R U sure U R GOP?  GOP has demonstrated over & over they R ideologues & don't care about people.  They (U?) R mean & cowardly.
except, sen, my insurance disappears in 7 mos. So there's that timeframe for me.waiting isn't good either,there's millions w me
please still to this, don't cave to political pressure. I prefer public option but can support more affordable care for all
yes, keep fighting this horrendous bill #Trumpcare
@neeratanden If you're over 60 and low income you are screwed...better invent time machine to stay young
If the AHCA is as great as you say, why doesn't the GOP work to make it the healthcare program used by Congress.
Single payer=better, more affordable care. Many models to choose from, all cheaper than our patch-work system.
Thank you for standing up for us! Country before party! #ACA #DonTCare #GOP #SaveACA @SpeakerRyan
@neeratanden What matters is Baby Boomers get punished for their lack of planning & failures. I don't want to pay their bill.
@neeratanden plz no tax cuts for rich . The people need reliable healthcare for all!
@neeratanden I guess that town hall got the message through his stubborn skull.
I agree. Good, affordable healthcare for ALL Americans is the most important agenda item in front of Congress. Be careful!
Remember when a seven-year-old boy dunked on you and everyone laughed? And realized your policies are monstrous? Good times.
