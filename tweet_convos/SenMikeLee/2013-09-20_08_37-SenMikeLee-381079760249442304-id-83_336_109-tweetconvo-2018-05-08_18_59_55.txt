@SenMikeLee @syjere17 We will still be voting out Boehner, Cantor, Ryan, & the rest of the establishment Republicans...
@PaulFolklore1 @SenMikeLee Exactly. One party of good ole boys, disguised as two, doesn't cut it. Last time I checked that's communism.
@syjere17 @SenMikeLee They act like they really did something..Mike Lee what did you actually accomplish, the answer is nothing..
@SenMikeLee It is going to do nobody any good to shut down the government. Nothing positive there. I think there will be a settlement.
@SenMikeLee @USVICTORY So the left believe republicans want to shut down government by funding government can you get them to explain?
@SenMikeLee Already thanked mine (the great Tom Graves) but thank you too, for all you are doing!
@SenMikeLee @Midgespeaks thank you for working for us Utahans in the senate..at least 1 good Utah senator believes in defunding Ocare
I've already thanked @aaronschock for doing the right thing.@SenMikeLee @rwhitmmx I've  asked @SenatorKirk to do the same.
@SenMikeLee Soooo... we won't thank you, then...
@SenMikeLee/ I don’t have any representation here in Monterey County.
