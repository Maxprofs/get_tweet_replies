@SenMikeLee @LoveuLynn Nevermind the critics, Senator. The ppl of your state selected you to govern, not a Democrat.
@SenMikeLee @RepMarkWalker Of course there is, but facts and history are not your strong point.
@SenMikeLee Everything about it is obviously improper, hence your need to snivel about it in advance #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee What about holding up aid to kids poisoned by lead by government bungling? #isthatethicaltoo
@SenMikeLee Withholding consent is one thing. Refusing to participate in the process completely is unprecedented. #DoYourJob #Obstructionist
@SenMikeLee You Sir have no shame. Your ideology is destroying our country. #BoughtAndPaidFor
@SenMikeLee    More bullshit from the liar from Utah.
@senmikelee There is something wrong with you holding up aid to 8000 poisoned children in Flint, MI. @thedemocrats
@SenMikeLee This is why we don't want people like you. I want you to lose. I want you out of office.
@opredemption009 @SenMikeLee Speak for yourself. There are a whole lot of Americans who want a principled constitutional conservative.
@SenMikeLee @ssandee51 Senator Lee purposely misleading people? Shameful.
@SenMikeLee when was the last time the senate chose to not hold hearings on a candidate with more than 10 months left in the presidency?
@SenMikeLee Says you. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Consent was given. Now, you're just withholding advice and consent w/o argument against the appointee. Have a lovely vacation.
@SenMikeLee "What's good for the goose..." I.e. Joe Biden & Senate vs Robert Bork, etc...
@SenMikeLee @TheRightMelody It's their JOB, I fthey have questions about a nominee's worth or ability!
@SenMikeLee What gives you the right to choose to not do your job?
@SenMikeLee the Senate isn't choosing to withhold consent, Tyrant McConnell is. Hold a vote, or are you worried a few R's have some sense?
.@SenMikeLee Nonsense. This move on the part of the GOP IS utterly unprecedented. Hold hearings, vote. Let Judge Garland serve. #DoYourJob.
@SenMikeLee Like it or not the people spoke in 2012, if u can't/won't do your job-RESIGN
@mfstoker @SenMikeLee They spoke in 2014 too...when they elected a majority GOP in both chambers. #RemoveFootFromMouth
@aldematt @SenMikeLee and what have they done, Oh yeah, lies and Obstruction and the 100 votes to repeal O'care
@SenMikeLee @smartvalueblog there is something very improper about another repub Sen. Pushing NWO on the people you work for. Shameful!!
@SenMikeLee #MikeLee thank you for ingnoring the constitution to serve the party
@SenMikeLee but it is bullshit refuse to even hold hearings or make up constitutional excuses for a sitting President not to nominate.
.@SenMikeLee Do you think for once in your fucking life you could stop lying? #UniteBlue
@SenMikeLee Fuck off loser.
@SenMikeLee praying the Senate stays strong on this issue
@SenMikeLee consider the idea that the supreme court be reduced to eight justices.  The founding fathers built an even numbered court with 6
@SenMikeLee Unless of course you swore an oath to do your job and you did, didn't you?  If you really don't want to do it, be an adult quit.
@SenMikeLee The constitution requires you advise and consent. You've signed pledge not to do that.
@SenMikeLee time for new leadership in Utah. What are guys 6 year old children crying because they don't get their way. #crybabies
@SenMikeLee it's a great way to get things done and demonstrates the effectiveness of our government, good luck in your reelection
@SenMikeLee Mitch agreed to meet with Obama, please tell Mitch to forget the meeting and JUST SAY NO NO NO.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob. Obstruct at your own peril.
@SenMikeLee NAY
                           NAY
@SenMikeLee LIAR!! #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Oh Really???
@SenMikeLee I thought Repubs promised in 2014 they could make Congress work. A swing and a miss for the Party of No.
@SenMikeLee @RepMarkWalker why not vote down rather than no hearings
@SenMikeLee there is a general pettiness and spoiled tantrumming child about it as well as general neglect of responsibility. U R all fools.
@SenMikeLee stop lying.  there is ZERO PRECEDENT for doing this...ZERO. But thanks anyways. Pres HRC , a DEm Senate will confirm a real lib!
@SenMikeLee Show me the precedent for refusing to even consider a nominee before you even know who they are
@SenMikeLee @MrDewMaster BUT WAIT...Mitch McConnell will fold and give into Obama for something shiny dangled over his head...wait & see.
@SenMikeLee you're a mentally challenged govt employee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee please show this precedent you speak of. Who? When?
@SenMikeLee @POTUS is going to do his job, why won't you and the Judiciary Committee do yours? I am afraid you have boxed yourselves in.
@SenMikeLee @freedomtex I agree! I am appalled at Martha MacCallum giving you such a hard time today!!!  Don't cave to BO!
@debbyjo921 @SenMikeLee @freedomtex You said consent review a waste of resources, like 60 Obamacare repeal votes #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee liar. It is improper. Never say you revere the Constitution again. Your actions close to sedition. I will work to defeat Ayotte
@SenMikeLee @freedomtex 
Make sure you remind  Sen.Grassly of this before his meeting with #POTUS
@SenMikeLee @freedomtex Agree. S.RES.334 1960:POTUS shouldn't make recess SCOTUS appointments.http://wapo.st/212OnHe 
.@SenMikeLee @freedomtex Mike, Utah is lucky to have you, as are the rest of us. I wish you weren't so selfless and had run for president.
@SenMikeLee  Mike,you are one of the good guys.Rock on bro...
@SenMikeLee Hey @HillaryClinton / @BernieSanders Read this....http://www.lee.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=speeches&id=0EBE5DF6-4883-489E-B090-120F387BE71B â€¦
@senmikelee your perpetuating the problem of partisanship, not solving it #GoBeyondPartisanship #SMH #AdviceAndConsentInsteadOfRefusals
@SenMikeLee I actually voted for you and supported your campaign because I wanted better in Washington. You're no better than @SenOrrinHatch
@SenMikeLee unseen except trashy partisan politics. The senate is supposed to represent the highest ideals of debate and democracy. Shame...
@SenMikeLee is appointed his or her decisions will outlive the nominating president. I see no good reason to reject any Obama nominee sight
@SenMikeLee Your argument regarding a president in his last year shaping the court for a predecessor is misleading. Any time a new justice
@SenMikeLee But there is no nominee. You're refusing to even consider a potential nominee based purely on partisan politics.
@SenMikeLee: CONSTITUTIONALLY correct. WE THE PEOPLE WARN GOP TO HOLD FIRM. NO MORE BENDING OVER, NO MORE COLLUSION. ENOUGH!
.@SenMikeLee you mean other than the fact that it's never happened before?
@SenMikeLee If you don't want to govern: LEAVE!
@SenMikeLee You are 100% full of shit Mike. Still supporting concept that Blacks only get 3/5 of a vote?
@SenMikeLee You better get on with your hearings now before Hillary nominates someone more liberal.
@SenMikeLee No.  But it's still the wrong thing to do.  And you know it.  BTW, Lame Duck status only applies after the election..not before.
@SenMikeLee  TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN LIE , WHEN WILL YOU EVER LEARN SEN . NUFF SAID .
@SenMikeLee At the very least, I've been waiting for such a moment since the disgusting treatment given to Robert Bork & Clarence Thomas.
@SenMikeLee @RBReich @SenWarren how does this bigotry and ignorance continue without direct challenge? The foolishness! #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @Freedom4Dummies staying to tell Obama to stick it up his ass
@SenMikeLee @RBReich @SenWarren  How do educated Senators say this without knowing it is ABSOLUTELY an incorrect statement if 1 just READS!
@SenMikeLee We conservative youngsters don't want you establishment idiots anymore. You are all failures. We need Trump!!!
@opredemption009 @SenMikeLee You're a Sanders supporter and you know it. Conservative my a$$!
@LouisianaEagle @SenMikeLee No conservative just a smart one who knows how to win. We can't keep making sorry arguments about dumb things.
@SenMikeLee why have u or other colleagues not come out & support Ted Cruz? Are the repercussions too much for you? Did McConnel say no
@Marhill7 @SenMikeLee GOPe would support Cruz as Rubio's VP.
@SenMikeLee Its says advise and consent. Which means you have to do something you idiot. When he nominates someone then advise.
@SenMikeLee Not to drag you into cynicism, but this is first time doing it to Obama. He won't sit idle, + he's much more cunning than Mitch.
@SenMikeLee As long as you like purposely stepping on land mines.Statement gave LibMedia&Dems political ammo & fodder&talking pts.#WiseUp
@Zachy224 @SenMikeLee More like strict obstructionist. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Withholding consent is one thing. Refusing to meet with the nominee, or provide advisement, is a whole other thing, Counselor
@SenMikeLee Grow up and stop acting like children.  You were voted in to govern, not throw tantrums.
@SenMikeLee The Senate's job is to approve or disapprove of a judicial nominee. If you disapprove, fine, but do your job.
@SenMikeLee Have you endorsed a Presidential candidate?
