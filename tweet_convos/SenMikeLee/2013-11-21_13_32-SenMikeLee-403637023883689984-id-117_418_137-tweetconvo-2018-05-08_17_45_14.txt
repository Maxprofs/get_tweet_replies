@SenMikeLee @USAlivestrong ok so how about do something about it, no more tweets no more talk just Impeach! You have enough to do so
@FitButFlawed @SenMikeLee Boehner has no reaction, but more jaw work???
@USAlivestrong its all they ever do is talk nobody takes action just #WindBags
@FitButFlawed I think they all have too much invested in the status quo--They love the way we go out our business and leave them alone!
@USAlivestrong Yup and when the crap hits the fan everyone will be sitting there going damn we should have listened. Its all a game to them
@FitButFlawed They've depended on our being too domesticated, too willing to live civilly!
@USAlivestrong he has become garbage in the eyes of most Americans so be sure another false flag will rise very soon
@FitButFlawed Looks like a series of grandiose  fumbles and lots of preening and mirror gazing, little to encourage anything else!
@SenMikeLee @TomDickson so get to work. 51 votes is easier to get than 60..a total repeal of Ocare for We the People . Smile at Reid w a TY.
@Lynx60C @SenMikeLee @TomDickson > i like ur logic!!!
@RonnieBenjamin @SenMikeLee @TomDickson Thanks Ronnie. Sometimes it is hard for busy Senators & Representatives to see a positive side
@SenMikeLee "If they can change the rules any time they want then there might as well not be any rules." @limbaught, today's show. @dlb703
@SenMikeLee Sort of like the teabaggers in the House changed the rules there? #potmeetkettle
@SenMikeLee The "very purpose of the [Senate]" is long since deceased. When election went popular the meaning and use of the Senate went too
@SenMikeLee @The2ndguardsUS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS BENEATH THEM!! THAT'S WHY NEXT NOVEMBER THEY ALL HAVE TO GO!!!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 The libs see the constitution as TP. They are totally lawless!
@SenMikeLee @Jim_Peoples_ "...Senate protects the American people from authoritarian one-party rule by requiring at least some consensus..."
@SenMikeLee Whe does the GOP even try to work with DEMS?? I do not understand.  This was so awful when GOP threatened this..,,they said.
@SenMikeLee @BarbieHitsBack If America cant see how shady the Democrat party has become after yesterday's vote than there is no hope left.
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler SO SINCE THEY BROKE RULES WHAT ARE OPTIONS IS THERE NOT A ETHICS BOARD OR COURT THAT CAN LOOK INTO RULE ABUSE
@Dymodon @SenMikeLee  Vote them out in 2014.  This is the cure.
@SenMikeLee absolutely Reid abuses his power. Not a real leader.
@sickntireddoc @SenMikeLee MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE'S NOT A PATRIOT BUT ISTHERE FOR HIS OWN ADVANTAGE & MORE POWER!!
@SenMikeLee Is there a chance that the Democrats will appoint the judges and then change the rule back before 2014 mid terms?
@SenMikeLee you're a tool! You and your butt buddy @SenTedCruz are a couple of #mentalmidgets #tcot #shitheads
@SenMikeLee Well, Obama breaks laws all the time.  What makes you think that won't spread.  We need to go after the Dem up for reelection
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 Sen. action destroyed the riles and handed #Obama dictatorial power. What do you plan 2 do about it, Senator?
@SenMikeLee pledge to filibuster every piece of legislation and deny all requests for unanimous consent until the rules change is overturned
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler  punch Hairy Reid in the face please
@SenMikeLee So what are you and your colleagues going to do about it? Talk or action!
@SenMikeLee @BarbieHitsBack  Dems are on path of Tyranny. When Govt.thinks it's bigger & better than the people, we're a Socialist Nation!
@SenMikeLee You control the purse. Return to individual funding & starve bad programs& departments. Defund judges who break oath of office.
@SenMikeLee We need to impeach Obama for illegal activity.  Get the Dem to come together you and get it done.
@SenMikeLee What would anyone expect from a worm like Harry Reid and his crew of uneducated Democrats that can't read what they vote for?
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 If by "purpose", you mean "wasting time, money, and resources to talk about time, money, and resources", than yes.
@SenMikeLee Anther desperate move by a desperate party.  Even in the majority they have managed to screw it up.  Payback Republicans???
@SenMikeLee #mike lee isn't there anything that can be done to stop this fascist take over of the Senate?
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun If you like your DEMOCRACY you can keep your DEMOCRACY....PERIOD
@SenMikeLee Who has standing to take this to court?  Better yet, who will stand and tell the people this is wrong?
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun change everything nothing has tradition anymore. Filibuster were there for a reason.
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun so was it like the cloture vote to move fwd with the bill giving the dem socialist party a simple maj to pass
.@SenMikeLee @CAP741776 Amen Senator Lee, Sir. Will work against them, repeal Obamacare in 2014. Dug their own grave, #Democrats Harry Reid
@SenMikeLee FDR would be so proud of his party. The left is disgraceful. Will do anything for power.
@SenMikeLee Well Sir, deny Harry his judges by refusing a quorum on the Judiciary Committee, do not vote them out.
@SenMikeLee 

Today the Judges, tomorrow the  change of the voting system and the day after tomorrow the stay forever.in 1600.
@SenMikeLee @WagnerTalone44 Desperate measure from desperate progressives, seeing their ideology slip away.
@KgiardenKaren @SenMikeLee They will eventually pay big time!
@WagnerTalone44 @SenMikeLee Indeed.  Karma is already in the process for all the deceit, treachery, and leaving our citizens to die abroad.
@SenMikeLee Today the Democrats double-down on Obamacare by limiting Republican options while giving Obama even more power.
@SenMikeLee Go away nobody believes that crap! Stop crying
@SenMikeLee they are the liberal crybabies
@SenMikeLee the Democrats want to do things they want to do, and to do it how they want to, and nobody to tell them they cannot.
@SenMikeLee @DrMartyFox  So, WTH are you guys going to do about it? CRICKETS!
@SenMikeLee @DrMartyFox I'd be surprised if an out right riot doesn't break out soon. Chks and bal's is critical for safety of America
@SenMikeLee The question is WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS OUTRAGE? Where was Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn?
@SenMikeLee @gardenofthegods Maybe now others will understand what Lee and Cruz were fighting to keep - America!
@RoseTompkins1 @SenMikeLee Yes indeed!
That's nice. They don't care. @SenMikeLee @luchadora41
@JamesAnjanette  
Hey >> @SenMikeLee
Why are you bragging on twitter that your party is gutless. If I'd just been bitch-slapped I'd not brag
@kraig4u @SenMikeLee I agree! I can't wait for 2014; #Dems will scream & shout about the same treatment they're giving @GOP today. #Payback
@SenMikeLee @gardenofthegods Because sir, they care not for the Constitution and care only win at all costs.
@SenMikeLee @IP4PI ReLly makes me regret the 17th Amendment, more than usual. @SenatorReid either crazy or evil.
@SenMikeLee Mike, please stop these guys...we are now a country where so few have all the power.
@SenMikeLee @IP4PI Jimmy Stewart/Mr Smith Goes to Washington - is rolling over in his grave.
@SenMikeLee Harry Reid is killing this Republic. This is not what the people want.
@SenMikeLee democrats don't believe in our system and this is further proof. Thus it's laughable when they get offended by the label Marxist
@SenMikeLee democrat radicals are starting as many fires as they can. Packing the courts w/nut jobs is a backstop for when they lose power
@SenMikeLee Now they can focus on Senators that ignore the majority of the electorate and have representatives in the Executive branch.
@SenMikeLee @GaltsGirl if they tried this BS!
@SenMikeLee @GaltsGirl Reid and Senate Dems are so partisan, lying sacks of crap! If Repubs had senate control Dems would be up in arms!
@SenMikeLee How can Obama change the rules to taylor his needs anytime he wants and get away with it(impeachment) asap.
@SenMikeLee Skipping socialism and going right to Communism.  What can be done?
No, @SenMikeLee It cannot be that the @GOP is outraged about a rule change consistent with the Const. Not after this
@SenMikeLee Let us keep working together to Repeal Obamacare!  Thank you.
@SenMikeLee please fix this when there's an R majority in the Senate in 2015. Promise?
@SenMikeLee @GlockLady Especially when so many Democrats are on tape opposing the "nuclear option" it's rather hypocritical
@SenMikeLee Way to incite more partisan division and finger pointing! What are you doing for #Utah? #tcot
@SenMikeLee these people R socialist hypocrites and we R supposed to believe that the #constitucion  is safe. America vote them out. 1789
Repealing 17th ammendment would also return Senate to intended purpose... @SenMikeLee @GaltsGirl
*swoon* RT @TCRunner288 Repealing 17th ammendment would also return Senate to intended purpose... @SenMikeLee @GaltsGirl
@SenMikeLee Brightside - easier to repeal ObamaCare and now impeachment!
@SenMikeLee if the GOP would stop with the childish games maybe it wouldn't have happened. People are so tired of the DC BS
@SenMikeLee This is yet another attack on liberty to a dictatorship! American is no longer what it was.
@SenMikeLee @syjere17 when the republicans regain control of the senate make sure you stick this change up their ass at every chance
@ConstWarrrior @SenMikeLee @OregonINFIDEL of which Obama,reid,Biden & Hilary not in favor as senators needed 2 "protect democratic debate"
@SenMikeLee @RileyRebel129 DO NOT FORGET THIS DAY!!!! WHEN REPUBLICANS ARE THE MAJORITY STICK DEM'S NOSES IN THEIR DECISION TO DO THIS!!
@im4ue  stop crying! You won't win national elections again country has changed. All you got is hate
@lhornr No sir, not hate, a whole lot of people that voted for current president are not happy. Are they "haters". I do not hate, I disagree
Simple: #SatanRisingInAmerica 
.@SenMikeLee @emgtay
... and...... what? Your not going to do anything about it! We The People have to elect new & hope we get some help..@SenMikeLee @sheilaaj
.@SenMikeLee @jonzies.They are desperate and their contempt for the rule of law is obvious.
@SenMikeLee And now we're stuck with this?  There is nothing to be done???
@SenMikeLee Yes it is! You have to stop them.
@SenMikeLee the left in senate look bad
@SenMikeLee In house rules should not take affect til election. Not mid game. Imagine a football game that changed rules at half time.
@SenMikeLee heard U on @seanhannity >> Hope U never underestimate what this #LAWLESS #POTUS is capable of again. #GOP failure of imagination
@SenMikeLee Also, it's real name is the "Constitutional Option" as it derives from Article I Section 5 of the Constitution.
@SenMikeLee just keep pounding Obamacare and the senate will be the GOP's next year!
@SenMikeLee Obama &Dem Senate GOT ANOTHER PIECE of AMERICA's FREEDOM &POWER! ObamaLIE/Care Is 100% Dems CONTROL over Americans' Life! DESPOT
@SenMikeLee I consider filibustering everything in the Senate to be a partisan attack on the very purpose of the institution.
You sound like a 7 year old who is crying about the ramifications of behaving badly at school.
#RepublicanObstructionism 
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee worked, though... didn't it?  they are scheming, unconcerned about what America wants and will rue the day they did this.
@SenMikeLee Desperate times for DESPERATE Dems...HYPOCRITES ON DISPLAY!
@SenMikeLee Several legal precedents, statements from Presidents and Supreme Court. Not really breaking rules.
@SenMikeLee I thought any one Senator could put a hold on any nomination? Please do so with ALL of obamas nominees.
@SenMikeLee this is going to be the death of America Obamas agenda to destroy is going ahead and who will stop him
@SenMikeLee 2005 Ds fillibustered Pres Bush nominees. Rs threatened nuclear option. Ds threatened to halt all Senate work. Gang of 14 saved.
@SenMikeLee Clinton nominee Paez blocked repeatedly by Sen Rs, approved with simple majority...
@SenMikeLee What step will they take next 2 finish mking Cong evn more Irrelevant? The slope was already slippery, they added a snow strm!
@SenMikeLee The Democrats "broke" it because of jackasses like you.
@SenMikeLee There are a couple of amendments that I think should be reversed, a la prohibition, and the popular election of Senators is one.
@SenMikeLee I really doubt if the public at large gives a rats patoot about The Senate filibuster rules.
@SenMikeLee   So they can just decide to break rules with no throw back?? Unbelievable. They'd scream holy murder if GOP  did that.
Tears "@SenMikeLee: Today's decision by the Democrats to break Senate rules is a partisan attack on the very purpose of this institution"
@SenMikeLee Senate Republicans threatened and intended to do the same back in 05 for the same reasons. Ds gave in so Rs didn't.
@SenMikeLee... Please continue your fight against big goverment...we will soon have an empirical president!
@SenMikeLee I went to your site and I am agreeing with most of them,When will the Republicans work for the people in waiting for IMPEACHMENT
@SenMikeLee the #democratic party LITERALLY does not care about the #constitution...especially when they are in power.  #communists
@SenMikeLee They are working on eliminating all opposition. Scary!
@SenMikeLee Well Mike if you all would wake up and smell the coffee these things would not happen.
@SenMikeLee Hope to see you elevated in 2016.
