Yes, It is an exciting, delightful week, with the GOP being put through hell over Ryan's monstrosity of a "health" bill
Remember this: You wouldn't be so excited if Hillary Clinton was President....you need to support Pres Trump more.
Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland...  I'm glad judges aren't political #RESIST
Garland wasn't a shoo in.Democrats didn't control the house or senate...it would be up to republicans to vote for him
Really shame on you. Why would I ask my boss if I can have a baby. Thought it was GODS WILL. He is one of the unfaithful
Merrick Garland much?
Pls continue to share your constitutional insights! @SenMikeLee
@CruzNewsLive I never hang hope on any man. Too many went bad. Sounds good but I'm suspicious.
@ChuckNellis the real fireworks start when the next Supreme Court justice retires in summer! Reid's nuclear option then happens!
@SenTedCruz #LoseCruz2018
It will be exciting and amazing...If the Dems do anything but obstruct...I hope that you're right!
@SenTedCruz Know what would've been exciting? Holding a hearing on Garland. This seat is stolen.
/ Oh, Yes /
@SenTedCruz Get this done we clearly see the importance of the right person being in the court. Go nuclear if the left forces it
That with COMEY testifying is going to be must SEE TV
@SenTedCruz Conservative Christians make for the WORST type of politicians/judges. They are corrupt and vilify small groups.
@SenTedCruz get it done and push forward our Presidents agenda! @POTUS
@SenTedCruz stolen seat
@SenTedCruz This shouldn't happen until healthcare resolved. You have already said 8 is enough.
Can't wait for Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed. Now we need Judge Kennedy or one of the liberal Justices to retire!
senator we need a plan to combat the dems. Keep bringing up things that aren't true to stop this admin. @SenFeinstein -sue them
Hell begins for him. We do not expect nothing good from the haters!
@SenTedCruz stolen seat. You guys are crooks and thieves
@SenTedCruz America will never know how big of Heros you two are. However History will notice. Either w/ur success or failure
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz it should be an exciting week to hear Comey talk about the investigation of @realDonaldTrump & #Russia
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump will be #impeached; wait until the next president is elected before you vote on a SCOTUS.
@SenTedCruz concerned that the Muslim ban will hit the Supreme court after he's confirmed
@d__el definitely not a surprise that USA never upheld the constitution.
@d__el exciting for who? We have a supreme Court that doesn't know the meaning of "is" and commas are total mind benders...
@SenTedCruz it's not the judge it's the POTUS who elected him we want all y'all out! Men without integrity compassion plus liars
Do Rs and Conservatives plan to run counter ads, etc. re: Gorsuch to counter Dems lies airing now?
It will be the beginning of the end of the credibility and impartiality of the SC. Bye Bye Democracy It's been nice.
. it's called law and order. CONSTITUTIONAL. Get used to it.
exciting? It's going to be a kangaroo court! Why doesn't GOP start kicking some DemocRAT asses?!!
@SenTedCruz oh I remember you think women are nothing. Men are in control of them
@SenTedCruz I don't understand how you could be excited! Is he he agains women's right?!
@SenTedCruz if the dems block go nuclear and get this done quickly please !
Hopefully the committee will do warm ups and stretches... Because: Olympic level posturing and posing. #caring
Please tell us why Garland didn't get a hearing? Oh yes, he was Obama's nominee, & U ignored your constitutional duty. Shameful!
NO VOTE ON GORSUCH SEN , NOT FIT TO SERVE .
Constituent. You are a shill Mike. Either DO SOMETHING or get out of D.C. Give us the same healthcare you have! #TermLimits
great job
Sen. Lee, please explain to this constituent why there's presently a vacancy on SCOTUS? How did that happen? Scalia passed away ages ago.
someone should ask Gorsuch if he thinks Garland deserved/deserves a hearing.
really? That's what you're excited about?
Better hurry up before Comey cancels this clown show
congratulations on your subversion of democracy and successfully putting party before country.
Exactly.
stay strong Mike
And on top of that you will rob the poor of their healthcare benefits and give tax breaks to the ultra rich. Delightful!!
@AmericanSpringg 
Good luck, you're surrounded by morons
"surrounded by"? More like "birds of a feather, fuck it up together". Give Trump a legit congres
I can't wait!
54% that's how far the number of uninsured people in Mike Lees' state but he doesn't care...why?
Wishing the judge luck and wisdom
I'm tuned in all the time but eager to watch the hearing on Monday with Clapper, Brennan, others.
Good luck 
great week I hope
block Gorsuch he does not believe in the constitution
lmao, u really need to stay away from National Enquirer! In the contrary, he believes n implementing it AS WRITTEN!
exciting in that we're that much closer to denying the rights of millions without checks/balances?
WHO is losing WHAT RIGHTS? Please don't give some made up stuff like health care, or immigration.
sorry who are you?
apparently some1 asking u a question u can't answer without you giving an ambiguous BS answer.U made a statement,just asking 4 facts
While you're at rule of law stuff, consider this Pres has more Russian connections than a Soyuz. Don't repubs think that's odd?
no they all work very closely with Putin and his 60 billion dollar. Like rats with cheese they smell  $$$&
The other "Republicans" (O'Connell, Graham, Cronyn, McCain) had better stop acting like such libtard Demoncrats..STAND TALL!!
Wait. I'm confused here...What happened to Judge Garland?
you can't put a man on the court that actually believes the constitution is s real and living document
it's about damn time!
I for one am not excited for the inevitable character assassinations on such a respectable man
What was wrong w a Merrick Garland? You skipped over that...
