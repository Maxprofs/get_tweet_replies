GREAT & what will the American people get when Obamacare is repealed? Back to being uninsured due to preexisting conditions?
Good ol' Patriotic American!  NOT!!!!
Stick to hiding behind an avatar & being deplorable. 'Kay?
Problem is, you only wish I were as dumb as you. Yes! Yes, I am far superior than you. Glad you recognize it! Thank U!
Congrats on your win as well.
no, I think not! ANYONE would have been better than phony, two-faced, A-W like Sen Lee! He voted 4 McMuffin!
I like ---> @SenMikeLee because he understands and supports the #Constitution. Good man.
HOW can U possibly continue this? Being deliberately dense? Lee voted AGAINST Trump, 4 McMuffin (wasted vote); what's good?
I like ---> @SenMikeLee because he understands and supports the #Constitution.
REALLY? Really, Sen Lee, just hours after you voted for McMuffin "to spite Trump" now you're there? Utah loses due to you!
REALLY? Really, Sen Lee? You didn't even support Pres-elect Trump when he named you as potential SCOTUS! Now? Now you're there?
can you repeal my pre-existing condition while you are at it Mr...I call myself Christian. Say hello to..jes...not going there.
you won't be there when it's over.  Evil begets evil.  Enjoy the toasty bed.
prices went up?  People lost everything before.
everything..god's creatures who through no fault of their..own have expensive medical conditions.  Should we die now?
you are going to repeal..a REPUBLICAN PROGRAM
hummm @SenMikeLee I remember watching u at the RNC.. I will always remember watching u at the RNC.. Always.. smh.. @jd_Constitution
@ReaganBattalion not gonna happen
Many of us will be watching closely. These are tense times for a country headed in the proper direction for 8 yrs.
@CutiePetunie cancel all exec actions immediately and advise new legislation if sufficiently important
@ReaganBattalion Haha!  You better stabilize him 1st!
Senator I look forward to working with you and the other Senators to work with President Trump to undo the past eight years.
Supreme court must be balanced in order to work.
OH now you care!
Repealing Obamacare not an accomplishment unless you can replace it with something better. Repeal w/o a plan is just spite.
He benefitted from Russian interference in the US election. We want an investigation #InvestigateTheVote #WeWantBetter
I thought you #Republicans didn't believe in confirming #SCOTUS nominees. You want to take heathcare from 20 million people.#GOP
@ReaganBattalion welcome to the dark ages with the #republicanparty
Why use blame to gain popularity?  If ObCare needs change, do it! Don't fault good work of another if the policies were needed/2
Thanks for taking a stand on principle by voting for @Evan_McMullin even though it wasn't the popular thing to do.
no wonder Utah has such growing problems, if Lee & his vote for spoiler McMuffin are "principled."
Forgot about your daughters, huh?
WTF?  u think we'll forget ur traitorous acts?  trust, we will not. The guillotine is calling ur name Mikey.  Vive le Trump!
you forgot "Replace" Oh wait, you have no replacement plan, never did
no vote for Session
When Obama came to office, aging population urgently needed ObamaCare, as Millenials have become the majority, not as urgent. /1

loser. Ha e you ever managed anything besides your own staff. You never really have. Sad.
Why does defending #PrinciplesOfLiberty enshrined in the #Constitution make you disappointed? I continue 2 B proud of @SenMikeLee
He does this & he will deserve my credit. He can even act like an ass if he can do all this.
but if he can do it all WITHOUT being an a** even better. Time to be presidential. Time to unite this great country
GL w that. Sorry you prolly hate all my sailor talk round here-just push our agenda I'll be happy as clam-plus he's lib EZ reach
Repeal NFA.
Here, let me help you help me.

Condolences.
You left out... and grab lots of pussies, and help him learn to read
remember presence set by Harry Reid federal judges only simple majority 51 don't buy supreme apt is different ram it threw
how can you congratulate trump ,when you tried to take him down not cool.
Congrats to you as well.  I admire you so very much.
Stay vigilant and keep him honest, Senator.
You should replace #Scalia. You are his natural successor and the #SCOTUS needs your voice! We need you @SenMikeLee. #JusticeLee
That's Mr President Trump Mike Lee. After all your put downs if Trump and he willing to still consider you for High Court
LOL -- Two days in and Trump has already vowed to keep Ocare. He's a Democrat Trojan Horse!
@Norsu2 @SenMikeLee No he didn't.People have asked him to keep certain good points.Dont want to lose pre-existing conditions
Socialism - socialized medicine has no good points. Trump is Obama's third term. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYrlDlrLDSQ …
@Norsu2 @SenMikeLee
@PAMsLOvE I do also
It a shame that you didn't help him get elected.  He did it without your help.  Makes me doubtful as to who you really are.
Lets comb his donor book rudy.... I smell a federal crime...:) I really do..
There is a blog out that said you were 4' 11" and that is the cause of your insecurity, anger and resentment...? Comment?
<-- #benedictarnold. and revoking tax status for the #mormonmafia cult.
You have a lot to answer for. If you fight against President Trump, I pray for your destruction. Your days of treason are over!
Don't forget 22 yr old incarcerated sailor who took 6 cell phone pics and is in fed prison. Reinstate him please.
@kksheld Subtle.
That's rich....you demanded he get out of the election.
I'm way disappointed to hear you didn't vote for Trump. #lostmy vote.
@TuxieTaylor13 Immigration Mike, you don't fix that and we'll eventually be a 3rd World Hell hole.
Recommend you add to your agenda rescinding Motor/Voter Law, or pass law requiring ALL states to demand proof of citizenship!
Now that we put him in there; where are the conservatives? Certainly not Christie.
you better after making a fool of yourself in Cleveland ;)
I really hope you meant to say "confirm constructionist judges"  The last think we need is more conservative oppression.
Find some courage Mr. Lee did you .... Where were you to defeat the Democrats?????? 

#Gutless
@Freedom4Dummies I hope you will help him along the way. He will need you.
hold his feet to the fire, Senator.
let's get it repealed. Repubs been promising for a long time.  So far, all talk not action.
I hope that are his beliefs!
And after Election Day, indicting, prosecuting, convicting and incarcerating HRC?

Thanks Mike for supporting President Elect Trump:)
We will remember how you tried to steal UT delegates at the convention. Liar!
Congratulations also to President-Elect Trump's landslide victory. Lawyer Benjamin Musau, Nairobi, Kenya http://bmmusau.com 
Congratulations to you Senator Mike Lee on your re-election. Lawyer Benjamin Musau, Nairobi, Kenya http://bmmusau.com 
@PeculiarBaptist 3 things that matter that the MSM never really addressed.
We need more just like Mike Lee!
how does his dick taste
To think that radio hosts have gone to bat for you and asked us to send you money, has turned to insult. Sore loser.
long as it nothing like justice roberts...
Thank you, sir.  We all look forward to the progess we make under President @realDonaldTrump .#MAGA
our next Supreme Court justice. Congratulations in advance sir.
You, my senator, are a huge disappointment. Your vote for McMillian was a vote for HRC. I hope the next 6 yrs find you gone.
you not only refused to support nominee but blocked and ridiculed him. You need to be purged. ASAP
how's that dumpster fire going?
yeah good luck with that.
Hopefully you are one of the judges.  Thank you for standing up for the Constitution.
@crazyhawg87 You forgot ending late term abortions.
glad you and @RandPaul won last night, too! Congrats to you both.
@AdamBaldwin will not happen..
Hoping to see your name on the Supreme Court list.
.@SenMikeLee hope you can sleep at night knowing you plan to help repeal legislation that keeps people healthy
oh sure- you wouldn't stand behind @realDonaldTrump but now that he wins you're ok with him.
we are with you Sen Mike Lee, time to come together and support the economic policies of Trump/Pence.
or BE said conservative Justice?
HOW ABOUT help building the wall and no amnesty? Remember we are watching 6 years are not that long.
@sdfellows I just wish that Mike Lee would have been on board at the Republican National Conference rather then protesting.
you're a hack Mike.  Let's not forget your failed coop at the Republican convention!
@mcprn1 Trump won this election for 1/2 Price that included a political revolution he will save the country billions
Too late. Don't trust you anymore.
Just junk it.
I hope you are his first pick!
... That's the spirit, Mike!
Good luck with that.  You are going to need a crapload of luck if you expect that con-man to do a damn thing.
congrats on the win sir!  Now let's PLEASE do something to fix the mess we are in rather than gloat we won.
Glad you'll be there to hold him to his promises Sir!!
Sorry Sen. Mike, remember he wants to replace it with something like Obamacare. Same song different verse. Smh
Suck it Mike
I hope he nominates YOU to the supreme court!
Think again
@JBaker31826004 great use the simple majority as the dems did!!!
I can't wait to see you on the Supreme Court!
Hope to see you on the supreme court! Congrats on re-election
@JBaker31826004 America 1st.This was our 3rd revolution. Changes must be made so we are never again this close to globalization.
@sheila14all There will be thousands of Obama Ex Orders to rip up! Thousands of Obama minions implanted in Federal Jobs!
Time To Clean House. Fumigate. Remove the ' Plants'...
I don't like ACA &want to see a new plan that still protects pre-existing conditions
Agreed
praying he actually doors those things and doesn't revert to authoritarianism.
let's unite!!
And, don't forget - we're going to be building a wall too, Senator....
#AmericanJobs #Security
#BuildTheWall
#NoAmnesty
Aren't you forgetting something? #NONAFTA, #NOTPP
Thank you!
And how about an apology for being a douch towards Trump?
@Claudia4Trump I am a mormon Utah Trumpster. I was disappointed in you. I hope my feelings change. Congratulations on your win.
yes!
One can hope
we feel the same about POStrump
I hope he appoints you as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court #TRUMP @realDonaldTrump
@Claudia4Trump But, you didn't vote for Trump
Amen on all points!
real easy to repeal it.the letter of the law is flawed. Roberts said so in the beginning.
After Ginsberg leaves the country, he can fill two spots....
Are you willing to accept being a SCOTUS appointee? :-)
@Rydell_C Hold Trump Accountable.
He must be held accountable! Or it's just as bad as the left turning the blind eye to Obama.
.@SenMikeLee Er, "conservative judges?" Would that be as in "conservative Supreme Court Judges?" <grin>
@lukejoh01158045 AMEN2 That
Trump won the popularity contest, which I'm thankful for. He's now going to need true conservatives like you to help guide him.
How do you feel about a cabinet that rewards Trump's cronies? Can we count on you to keep him in check?
You need to run for the Majority Leader of the Senate. We need strong, principled leadership to be successful, not McConnell!
and congrats to Senator Lee for making it through the elections! A great conservative to help guide trump.
@TimothyLShull @marcorubio Yes! Obamacare repeal/replace or fix should be job one.
And here's me hoping he appoints you to the Supreme Court.
hi ifU legit ourGroupMedIllegalBlock 4LONGyrsAdvocateAsSufferWorsenDIE TAXFRAUDbillions so pl Action speaks&videoDontLie #trump
I wouldn't be so confident about DT, were I you.  Tread carefully.  Dude doesn't like being told what to do.
So, you will support him now?
I used to have great respect for you until your actions in this election. You should do better at making amends.
Your bitch ass was trying to tear him down when he needed help most. Your a scoundrel. We don't forget. Fuck off.
<<<another of the trumpCULT spewing their "special" kind of unity  @SenMikeLee
he needs you!
@scm021374 probably be good to repeal Roe v Wade and get the bible taught in schools finally, right?
Thank you for showing class and respect for our President. I gained a lot of respect for you today.
Let us begin 2 practice #highcalibercitizenry and each of us rise by celebrating our diversity & sharing our gifts and talents!
@PaulcTynan antigay scum bag (mike)
and abortion. Don't forget abortion!
keep a close eye on him; make it happen.
No thanks to you Senator. He won despite the #GOP #MSM #ClintonMachine #DOJ
Congratulations Mr. Lee
@AdamBaldwin yeah, how about you be one, senator Lee? You and Cruz in SCOTUS is a good start.
@gentlemanirish A little too late but I do believe you'll work well with him. Glad Utah understood the importance of a Trump win
: & patriots who value healthcare for ALL, abhor unfettered GREED & want fair judges will fight u & yr ilk EVERY step of the way!
And create a peaceful united America and world.  Peace through strength.
eat shit
Too bad you didn't support him...we noticed
@gentlemanirish 
Precisely.
May the changes Pres- Elect Trump makes R for the good of all people!
@AdamBaldwin sadly the sick are left to die while kkk celebrates! Well done you!
@misserdoodles you're a big disappointment.  I'll never think of you in a positive light again.
Hold him to it.
Congratulations Senator Lee. We need you fighting for the Constitution & the American people right along with Senator Cruz!
Good tweet, Sean. Sen. Lee:  Form a coalition to "drain the swamp" and evict all of the leftist denizens therein.
as a Supreme Court Judge, whatever you need Mr. President 
OHsoDoWe weHave4yrsVideov#obamacareFrauds as SickWorsenDie& bill$taxfrauds ITStime4 full expose main media coverup
@DocWashburn u and @tedcruz need b the SCOTUS noms
You are a valuable asset for The United States in the Senate. Thank You for staying upright. The United States of America won!
wow, just in the nick of time senator....
What will replace Obamacare?  I happen to like having my 23, 21 and 19 year old children still on my employer plan.
Don't delay! Please get to work on this immediately.
One-Term Senator who could have been great. #FAIL
Lee, UNDERSTAND, American are PISSED with you establishment pogues, TAKE NOTICE of face the consequences.
oh now you're on board now
Work with Trump on massive infrastructure investment and border security. We voted for that too.
Repealing Obamacare is easy. Answering to those that will be denied insurance after they get sick will be more difficult.
Thank you! As a Utahan, I have been ANGRY & embarrassed at UT GOP in DC not supporting DJT!!!

and start working with me?
With the way you acted that is so disingenuous. You are not forgiven & behavior not forgotten
@realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr In spite electoral win, NOTHING has changed (watch ur back)
