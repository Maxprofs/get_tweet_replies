@SenMikeLee it’s time to get physicians to stop taking Obamacare. Then it collapses…..No one can dictate who you see as a patient!
@SenMikeLee @Scooter_Texas Sen. Lee & Cruz r worth their weight in gold. They should have a nice meal & put on 1lb. each.

@SenMikeLee thank you for being a true Patriot!
@SenMikeLee No more room for RINOs...if they don't defund ACA, they OWN it - and will pay for their cowardice. Keep fighting, Senator!
@actlightning actually, the republicans can't defund the bill.right now all they can do is vote against ending the debate
@tbshaff They can do it in the senate if they find the stones, and the House can do it with ease.
@actlightning there are not enough Republicans to do anything but to prevent a vote on the bill by voting no on cloture
@tbshaff That would get the job done.
@actlightning as much as I wish it would, it only puts evrything in hold.only hope wld b 2 get 14 dems to join and pass bill
@tbshaff Value is to force Senators to own the ACA by forcing them to support it...any delay can accomplish that, and they will pay in 2014.
@SenMikeLee @CesarConda @JohnCornyn can we count you in Senator Cornyn?
