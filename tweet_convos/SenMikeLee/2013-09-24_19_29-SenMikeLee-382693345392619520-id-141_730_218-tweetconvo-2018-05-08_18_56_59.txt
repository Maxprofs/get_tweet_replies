.@SenMikeLee I also want #ObamaCare repealed, replaced, defunded, but not with freaky,  wing-nut-drooling sideshow. #StandWithCruz
@toddschnitt @SenMikeLee Plz explain *precisely* what is wrong with Obamacare? You don't like it, you don't have to buy in. What's ur beef?
@rpwpb If you don't have private insurance then YOU MUST enroll in O'care~if not YOUR ARE FINED~second year FINE is doubled~IRS will take $
@SenMikeLee @vlb55jr And every one of those emails are based on bogus 'information' put out by the #Koch types to fool the gullible yokels.
.@rpwpb My insurance premium just went up 74% because of #ObamaCare. And no Koch brother in sight. #ImagineThat @SenMikeLee @vlb55jr
@corrcomm @SenMikeLee @vlb55jr That's odd, given that Obamacare premiums haven't taken affect yet. Insurance co screwing u.
.@rpwpb My premium "takes affect" on 1/1/14. But I've received notification of what the bronze level plan will cost. @SenMikeLee @vlb55jr
@SenMikeLee @CAT1PRO Simple question to ask "Are you willing to bet your children's lives on Obamacare'? Americans say NO
@weeki1 @SenMikeLee  #Obamacare has cost #TheWorld more than 20BILLION$$$$$$ in 12 days! Throw it away! #AMERICA deserves better!!!
@SenMikeLee @ramjet_tx  To bad cornyn wont answer his phones.

@SenMikeLee If I can ask @PattyMurray to defund ACA everyone should contact their senator and ask to defund now!
@SenMikeLee @mistere777 Mr. Lee! We need to Start By Firing the traitors to this Country, Hiding under the GOP covers.  To:Give in why win?
@SenMikeLee that's because you get emails from fellow batshit-crazy people. Support something sane and you'll get more emails.
Don't like your senator? Don't feel like yours even comes close to representing you? #AdoptaSenator!

@SenMikeLee how about supporting #HR1801 and keep some of the expenses of treatment on the ins company
@SenMikeLee  Thank you Senator Lee, you are a great American and I appreciate all your efforts to defend Obamacare!
@SenMikeLee  We all hope your colleagues received similar  correspondence Senator Lee. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee My Republican Senators who support funding Obamacare forwarded their phones to voicemail.
@SenMikeLee  Please defund it, repeal it and anything else you can do to stop it. Thank you for standing with Cruz and the people.
@SenMikeLee Thank you!!!  You and Ted Cruz have the American Spirit!
@SenMikeLee Thank you.
@SenMikeLee r all of those from yr kids or your cousins
@SenMikeLee Man I hope you did not go soft and explain the liberal spin.

@SenMikeLee thanks for the hard work!
@SenMikeLee the "delay" tactic is a sham...simply assures more pain. Defund is the solution.
@SenMikeLee: I have complete and utter faith in you. It's many of your colleagues that I'm worried about...!
@SenMikeLee One wonders how many were sent to @johncornyn. I sent him one earlier for his shenanigans.
@SenMikeLee Get the dirt on all the RINOs from the NSA and publish it the way they did...
@SenMikeLee keep at it....die with your boots on,,,,,the Lamestream media will talk bad about you regardless....#MakeDCListen
