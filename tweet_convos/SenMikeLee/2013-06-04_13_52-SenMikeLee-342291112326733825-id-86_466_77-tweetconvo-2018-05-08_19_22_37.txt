@SenRandPaul @SenToomey and when Palin said "death panels" the left laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Little Sarah isn't laughing
@papacass84 @SenRandPaul @SenToomey Sebelius is a "Death Panel" of one, denying a 10-yr old girl a lung transplant. #obamacare
.@Leslie_H20 @papacass84 @senrandpaul @sentoomey Every American life matters, especially to the parents of that child.
@TamaraColbert @Leslie_H20 @papacass84 @SenRandPaul @SenToomey  You are so right, there has to be something we can do to help this child !!!
.@ParaDc @leslie_h20 @papacass84 @senrandpaul @sentoomey No pressure Senators, but Its up 2 U, unless Doc's go rogue & operate.
@TamaraColbert @ParaDc @papacass84 @SenRandPaul @SenToomey Docs ought to go rogue. It's not like they're getting respect from Sebelius.
@senrandpaul @sentoomey @senmikelee She is a cruel human being if she doesn't lift ban! Give that child a chance to live!
@SenRandPaul @NickEgoroff @SenToomey Didn't you learn the lesson of Terri Schiavo? This will haunt you, Rand.
@SenRandPaul @nadinemaenza @SenToomey How about congress get over their Obamafear and deal with this?
@SenRandPaul @Kate_Is_Awake @SenToomey Congress needs 2 REPEAL O-care and end this BS and Death Squads! This is worse than IRS abuse! WTF!
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey You are wrong about the transplant issue.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey
@skitch411 @senrandpaul @sentoomey this is just too much!!  Where is our America?  How can we deny this need? #horrified
#CHRISTIANDEMS MUST demand to #Savesarah THEN this Admin will listen. (votes) Many of my dem friends leaving party! @SenRandPaul @SenToomey
@Iamkellylong @SenRandPaul Saw that too, great to hear answers to questions!!
@Iamkellylong @SenRandPaul Yes, he does and it is so appreciative. Our own president can't even answer a question correctly !!
Thanks @SenRandPaul @FoxNews you helped make history; judge's ruling to #SaveSarah & children younger than 12's a miracle. Let's save lives!
@SenRandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenToomey Ignorant.  Little girl has wks. to live, and some beuracrat moron excusesGov't tooROYALfor we thepeople.
@SenRandPaul @coff33loveit @SenToomey Can no one bypass this? Bet it would be if name was Obama, Clinton, Pelosi et al!!!
.@SenRandPaul @61soprano @SenToomey Can you say 'death panel'?
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Sibelius is a one woman death panel. Welcome to ObamaCare.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey #DeathCzar @Sebelius is the #PontiusPilate of ObamaCare. Washing her hands in little girl's death order.
"Federal Rule" - Gov't should have NO role in whether treatment is approved. @SenRandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenToomey #ObamaCare
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey There are always exceptions. Make the exception!  These are just guidelines people. Do what's right! #saveherlife
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey / What else can you expect from a criminally minded person like 
sebelius? who needs secret private emails galore.
@SenRandPaul @AACONS @SenToomey Sen. Paul, you have to realize, most likely Sec. Sibelius just considers this a near birth abortion.
@SenRandPaul @SenMikeLee @SenToomey .Screw HHS do it anyway !
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey or we could embrace the freemarket: allow private organ sales & organ donation lists. Capitalism drives innovation.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey bet her parents wanted ACA and voted for Obama--welcome to the world of socialized MED-no death panel req'd! #tcot
@SenRandPaul Mitch McConnell:  WHY no cloture vote for the immigration bill?
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey This is what happens when the government gets involved with healthcare.
@SenRandPaul @gelnails2012 @SenToomey  not endangering hers, Senator. Its going to MURDER her.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Rules are made to control the non-elite. Dismantle the Federal gov't. Abolish the IRS, FDA, EPA, OSHA & fraud. #tgdn
@SenRandPaul @CrosbyJeff @SenToomey An Obamacare preview.
@senrandpaul @sentoomey Thank You! :)
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey please help this 10 yr girl, this is insane she only has 2-5wks to live without that lung
@SenRandPaul @EricaRN4USA @SenToomey God bless you for raising awareness, Senator!!
@SenRandPaul what are the odds?
@SenRandPaul @sentoomey @gretawire. Please help to #SaveSarah
@SenRandPaul @kksheld @SenToomey I am so sickened by this, I cannot think of anything to write.
@SenRandPaul get Sarah a job in DC where rules do not apply. #savesarah
@SenRandPaul @kksheld @SenToomey When rules get between you and your Doctor, people will die needlessly!
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey File Child Endangerment charges against HHS...
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey sebelius refuses to step.   And she could.
.@SenRandPaul @sentoomey Kathleen Sebelius is disgusting! She's going 2 let this little girl die & now she's in charge of all our healthcare
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Politics as usual ... unbelievable!
@SenRandPaul TX guidelines are made per surgeons, NOT bureaucrats. You know that. This has nothing to do w/ fed regs. You know that too.
.@SenRandPaul @queenBee1120 @SenToomey I'm afraid this is only the beginning with Obamacare breathing down our necks!
@WenzOmatic unfortunetly im afraid to say thats probably true :( @SenRandPaul @SenToomey
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey DISGUSTING ! Can u say #hypocrite ? U point the finger? How many do you #sentence to #death with repeal #obamacare ?
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Sebelius:"Some people die"
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey You are a fraud and coward. Several adults have priority over Sarah..
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Best of luck Senators clearly something should be done for this girl but Sebelius not exactly pro life, won't care.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey No. Not fair to others on transplant list. Procedures are there for a reason. Evaluate P&P but don't lift for one.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Not medically ethical to change rules for one child
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Federal rules damage more than they protect!
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Glad to see ObamaCare did not create death panels.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey HS says "uh uhhuh!"
@SenRandPaul @sentoomey huh I didn't think there was death panels? #SaveSarah these "public servants" are gonna stir up the hornet nest
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey what I want to know is will Congress stand by and allow @Sebelius to let that child die? Death Pannel #1
@SSReaney @SenRandPaul @SenToomey @Sebelius Sebalius SELF-APPOINTED FIRST DEATH PANEL showing just how its going 2 work=heartless, merciless
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey What campaign will we have when this happens 100X a day?  We need to defund Obamacare.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey If that child dies, then her death is on the head of @Sebelius who has the power to over rule the rule!
@SSReaney @SenRandPaul @SenToomey @Sebelius Trust me. she doesn't give a flip.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Why don't you try her at her SECRET email acct: Kathleen.Sebelius@hhs.gov
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Just another reason to overturn Obamacare!
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey 
My thoughts and prayers for her and the family and those caring for her.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Why is there a federal rule at all?
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey The New Normal
@SenRandPaul @rachelcohen12 @SenToomey Obama should issue executive order for this! One time I'd be in favor if him using it!
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey  What rule, death panel?   10 yr old not adult= death, 26 year old child on parents insurance= A OK
@SenRandPaul What can we do now for the victim of Fort Hood now that Nidal Hasan has admitted he did it to "protect the Taliban"?
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Put yourself in the mothers shoes! This should be fast tracked.Give her the lung already! Please help her, God bless
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Is that what Sarah Palin meant of a "Death Panel?" Rhetorical Question, the answer is YES! Gov't involved in Med Ser
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey just saying after IRS EPA Benghazi one has to ask
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey hate 2 ask but R parents conservative  liberal bet U Sibelius know quote some die IRS may b fun time 2 die or comply
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey sadly,the reality of the organ donor program is there are more needs than organs available.Someone is going to die.
@SenToomey @SenRandPaul And so it begins... having 2 prove worthiness 2 get medical care #deathpanels #obamacare
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey Pretty soon we'll all have to run twitter campaigns just to get a checkup.
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey I expect nothing less from 
Kathleen Sebelius--she is a mass murderer of the unborn--she does not value human life!
@SenRandPaul @SenToomey we will see more and more of this kind of situation with Obamacare  she is not within the bell curve of treatment
