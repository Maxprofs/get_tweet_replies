@SenMikeLee As usual, his whole spiel is fraught with false premises, strawmen, and shuck-n-jive. Lies. All lies. @texasfreedom101to
@SenMikeLee @teaparty321 That's the same thing as " YOU FUCKED UP YOU TRUSTED ME" (Animal House)
@SenMikeLee @avemariateacher 

There R more than enough separate charges>TREASON>MURDER>ABANDONMENT> to prosecute him if USA makes it 2 2014
.@SenMikeLee @avemariateacher will he now admit detrimental reliance? With measurable damages? Perhaps add to Articles of Impeachment?
@SenMikeLee @AppSame But sadly, he still hasn't admitted he lied...or apologized for lying...we know he won't.
@SenMikeLee @avemariateacher 

Senator>that appears 2B an ADMISSION OF FRAUD>Who cares if Senate will impeach Goober>Indict him on something
@SenMikeLee Senator who cares what he says or doesn't he's All Spin All the Time.There is no middle ground it has been scorched Free or Die.

@SenMikeLee @Vision4USA > now! that is a shocker! since BHO knew this would happen with ACA. BHO is not creditable, not honest,not truthful.
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler Not me. I NEVER depend on the gov. If things implode, I can hunt, forage, drerss...Like to see libs try.

@SenMikeLee If you want to understand Obama’s decisions and his underlying motives, see “Obama’s America: 2016”
@SenMikeLee i don't care what he says now he never mentioned that you could keep your insurance if it had'nt changed since 2010
@SenMikeLee do U think people will forget that you are either ignorant of facts OR a liar when you lose your primary? http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/11/05/insurance-cancelled-dont-blame-obama-or-aca-blame-america-insurance-companies/ …
@SenMikeLee @AppSame Pres. Obama sat across the table from @GOPLeader acknowledge that he knew10 million or more would lose their insurance
.@SenMikeLee @dave_gosh Only 'cause ppl kept pressure on 'bout the lies - All need to keep pounding now 'bout harms "OC in entirety causing"

@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler But nothing will come of it. Too much $ was wasted on implementing it that COULD have gone to ppl in real need
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler GUESS WE ARE SUPPOSED TO KISS HIS FEET OR MAYBE HIS BEHIND HE LEADS FROM ?
@SenMikeLee actually he barely said that at all. keep up the good work. thank you for all you do.

@SenMikeLee @Gengm7 The Great Community Organizer!
@SenMikeLee Mike we need new leadership.  See 15 reasons for forming a new party at #classiclib
@SenMikeLee The ELECTION was based on these lies!
@SenMikeLee @The2ndguardsUS Impeach him for public perjury
@SenMikeLee @AmyKremer Poor deluded ObamaZombies! Truth hurts, doesn't it?
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber Worst non-apology in history and he lies about it being an apology.  People dying because of lost health ins.
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber Can you say FRAUD?  Most dishonest and incompetent POTUS in history.  #ImpeachObama
O needs called out by all of you in Congress!. He knew this would happen & intended it. It was obvious 2 most.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Here's a thought...Since Obama's Puppet Master is using Obamacare to divert attention You should talk about something IMPORTANT!
@WBVT_98FM @SenMikeLee I still believe Obamacare is unconstitutional,and we have been misled about the whole thing.
@SenMikeLee Too bad it was fully intentional on his part. (And they aren't sorry about it)
@SenMikeLee Low info voters elected a mental dwarf and now we are all suffering.
@SenMikeLee So DESPICABLE. Turning the blame around to the people = LIAR, TRAITOR, CRIMINAL.  #ImpeachObama NOW!!
@SenMikeLee He's sorry we Relied, but Not that he LIED!!! @anthropocon Feel a good country song coming on.....
@SenMikeLee His supporters let themselves be targets for SCAM, thinking they could get brass ring for free & easy! Nothing is free; STRINGS!
@SenMikeLee Losing respect for GOP.$27mil EACH spent to sign 5 PPL up.What the eff is wrong w/you all.All u atty's &u can't stop this admin?
@SenMikeLee You r giving him way to much credit 4 half apology at best.That sh*t is not helping me pay my $1200/ mo med expense.GetOverIt
Bush Lied, People Died.

Obama lied, people got better health care plans.

#RandPaulStyleTweet 

@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee POTUS lied to get re-elected!  #Obamacare problems can only be solved by #RepealObamacareNow
@SenMikeLee He was not sincere. Kept saying "well it was ONLY 5% of the population"  "So sorry you misunderstood me" 
Lying about the lie.
@SenMikeLee He should be asked to resign.  He has intentionally hurt the American people with forethought and malice.Please stop #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee like us republicans did with your suggestion of a shut down... LOSER
@SenMikeLee When are you & your Teabag idiots going to apologize for shutting the government down & costing the economy $24 BILLION?
Waiting
@SenMikeLee and only 22% of uninsured say they'll sign up...REPEAL!!!
@SenMikeLee There is no doubt that Obama has been a failure & #Obamacare & all his other plans have been failures. Is he out? NO! WHY?
@SenMikeLee I didn't hear the "sorry" the same way everyone else did. He should have acknowledge he LIED. The 5% he dismisses voted for him.
@SenMikeLee Obama sorry not sorry!
@SenMikeLee Obama can say he is sorry all day long but he will do nothing to change it. The man isn't sorry...it was intentional
@SenMikeLee If he wouldn't have lied he wouldn't have gotten elected.  Nice ethics huh?
@SenMikeLee he may acknowledge but he doesn't give a dam
@SenMikeLee In other words, SUCKER!
@SenMikeLee Obama doesn't regret it. He has said before he prefers single payer plan. His failure is his win. Obamacare fails, hello gov.
@SenMikeLee  Why didn't your magic underwear protect us from this monstrosity?!? #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee - being one who has lost my insurance - I say @BarackObama can keep his apology - IF he likes it. Period. #fauxpology
.@SenMikeLee Obama Shouldn’t B the Only One Apologizing 4 Misleading Statements About the #ACA http://thedailybanter.com/2013/11/obama-shouldnt-be-the-only-one-apologizing-for-misleading-statements-about-the-aca/ … #TruthMatters #ethics
@SenMikeLee Actually the people who follow your bullshit are screwed. The lady who lost that policy with NO hospital coverage not so much
@SenMikeLee Your turn to confess your sins, Sen Lee. So many to confess -- where to start? Your war on U.S. cost billions of tax dollars...
@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 He's blamed: Bush, Republicans, Tea Party, Racism, Wall Street, Banks, Ins. Cos., etc.! What's his responsibility?
@SenMikeLee IMPEACH HIM....
@SenMikeLee That's short for "He lied his ass off." @EricAmey2 #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee finally, but it's a day late and a dollar short for those who relied and got harmed... tsk, tsk, tsk.
@SenMikeLee how? That's the ? Of the day. #impeachobama #RedNationRising #tcot
@SenMikeLee Really?
