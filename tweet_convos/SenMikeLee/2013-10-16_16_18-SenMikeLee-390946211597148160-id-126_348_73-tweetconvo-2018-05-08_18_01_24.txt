@L_Wheels Yeah that's not possible that you typed that up.
Because it's impossible for Obamacare not to work, right? RT @JoshuaMilesh: @L_Wheels Yeah that's not possible that you typed that up.
@L_Wheels Just like its impossible that it'll work right? Only Republicans deal in absolutes.
@JoshuaMilesh Do you think it's working now?
@L_Wheels I think it's two weeks old.
@JoshuaMilesh Do you think it's been working so far?
@L_Wheels I think that depends on who you talk too. I've seen cited examples for it working and not working.
@JoshuaMilesh I would love to hear your examples of it working!
@L_Wheels Sorry to hear. Law only hurt the working people. Only the middle class and people who are not in the know will be hurt.
@Glennjbourgeois Those of us who work hard, pay our own way, choose our health care responsibly. We're now forced to support those who don't
@L_Wheels @Glennjbourgeois My $500k household income is being taxed for the good of the country. That's the American way. 3 cheers for ACA!
@justsayit65 The American way is people who earn their money keeping it, deciding what's best for them & donating what they want to charity.
@BillVanTweet @justsayit65 Me too! I'm happy to donate what I can to those in need! But I can't when I'm forced to spend more by the govt.
@L_Wheels They are changing the coverage and in order to do so must offer you new plan.  They are not cancelling your coverage.Read it again
@HughScot They are canceling my current plan due to Obamacare regulations. No way to misinterpret; it says so right in the letter.
@L_Wheels But not cancelling your coverage, different plan plus more cost.
@HughScot Yes it cancels my current coverage. Just because it offers different coverage doesn't mean it doesn't cancel my currwnt. It does.
@L_Wheels  Every person who has received a notice of cancellation/increase of premium should post it.I'm tired of left saying it's not true.
@127bama Agreed! Check out Twitchy for a pretty big list of people who tweeted pics of their cancellation letters.
@L_Wheels will do. I've seen several, but I know there are many more out there. Thanks! Keep up the good work!
@127bama Thanks! :)
@L_Wheels @Norsu2 Yeah right. You made that up because you want Obamacare to fail. Etc.
You refuse to believe truth because of politics? RT @Minutemaniac: @L_Wheels Yeah right. You made that up because you want Obamacare to fail
@L_Wheels I mean that's what rank-and-file Libs are saying to folks who prove their healthcare is being disrupted by ACA.
@Minutemaniac Oh I see. Lol. Didn't catch your sarcasm in the flood of similar, serious comments in my timeline! My bad. :)
@L_Wheels That's what's so frightening/infuriating. The complete. aggressive denial of some of these folks.
@L_Wheels "If you like your plan, you can keep it."
*crickets* RT @JessaNaomi: @L_Wheels "If you like your plan, you can keep it."
@L_Wheels @JessaNaomi I'm waiting for him to tell us, "You didn't like your plan..."
@JBrenn @JessaNaomi You would be SHOCKED at how many Liberals in my timeline over the past day and a half are saying just that!
@L_Wheels @jbrenn Oh, boy. I can't wait until they appoint a personal nanny to act on my behalf, too. I won't have to make any decisions!
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Uh, reading comprehension failure? Your plan is changing.  Like it usually does every year.  That's not canceled.
@ryan_o_ceros @SenMikeLee Nope. My CURRENT plan is cancelled. Because of Obamacare. Did you read the letter?
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Yes.  Is this the first time your health coverage has ever changed?  If so, lucky!
@ryan_o_ceros @SenMikeLee First time my plan was cancelled because of Obamacare, because govt thinks they know better than I do!
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee How young are you? I haven't had the same plan for more than a year in the last 20 of full time employment.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee But of course we all know we can blame the Affordable Care Act for even the slightest perceived misstep.  Oh noes!
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee I feel your pain, my premiums tripled
Sorry to hear that! SHARE your story! RT @DKobylinski: @L_Wheels I feel your pain, my premiums tripled
@L_Wheels 2 healthy 27yo's married 1 newborn. Premium was $230/mo, cheapest bronze $738/mo. W/ higher deductible ($6k)
Awful! RT @DKobylinski: @L_Wheels 2 healthy 27yos married 1 newborn. Premium was $230/mo, cheapest bronze $738/mo. W higher deductible ($6k)
@L_Wheels @DKobylinski Was it $230/mo for your family plan? Still trying to put this together out here in California...
@Hwoodpolitix it is until the first of the year, then the ACA plan kicks in at $738/mo
@L_Wheels @Buckyworks Same happened to my family....we were forced into another plan with a different provider (BCBS)
@Duane106 @Buckyworks Sorry to hear that!
@CampeauWayne I do remember it, but evidently Obama did not...
@L_Wheels @Jn3_16_21 what it's the price difference(increase) that's what I'm interested to hear
@Portland_John @Jn3_16_21 20-30% increase, I believe. At the very least.
@L_Wheels we need to demand that the news reports this!
@JoAnneNolen Tweet the news organizations who used that phrase! Tell them what you think - they need to stop dehumanizing babies!
@L_Wheels @Jn3_16_21 Doesn't look cancelled to me. You can keep it til Dec. '14 & there are other options. You are still covered.
@MorteDeMocknbrd @Jn3_16_21 My current plan is being cancelled. Because of Obamacare. Other options aren't what I want and cost wayyy more.
@L_Wheels @JoeTalkShow will the cost be the same though?
@missquiltLaura @JoeTalkShow No, the premium for the plan that is acceptable under Obamacare is ENORMOUS. Way higher than my current one.
@L_Wheels I got one too from @grouphealth. They are cancelling my current plan but offering another plan. Rate goes from $444 to $876.
@JaimeVelo @grouphealth So sorry to hear that! SHARE your story as much as you can!
#overdramatic "@L_Wheels: Just received a letter from my health insurance provider canceling my current coverage...because of Obamacare!‚Äù
@ozoneic Since when is righteous indignation over canceled plan, jacked premiums, and an assault on my freedom over dramatic?
@BillVanTweet Thanks! You too.
@L_Wheels Surprised?
@jennisahotie Nope. Never surprised when obvious things happen, but always shocked at the outright assault on my freedom.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Many seniors are getting cancelation notices. Obamacare is sticking it to seniors. #tcot
Seniors, youth, middle class... RT @CForum: @L_Wheels Many seniors are getting cancelation notices. Obamacare is sticking it to seniors.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee we just got this same thing here in Los Angeles. This can't be happening!
Sorry to hear that! RT @digitalwavetv: @L_Wheels @SenMikeLee we just got this same thing here in Los Angeles. This can't be happening!
@L_Wheels @RightCandidates I got one of those letters from my insurance last week! Sad day!
@rapsays40 Sorry to hear that! So many people are receiving them.
@L_Wheels But this wasn't supposed to happen.... lies, lies and damn lies.
@TheRealPanicFC Exactly! "You can keep your coverage...your doctor..." NOT.
. @L_Wheels Liz, DO NOT let Blue Cross put you in an exchange plan. Rather, look for non-Obamacare alternatives. #Obamacare
@RedheadAndRight Don't worry! I'd rather pay the penalty.
@L_Wheels when this mess blows up due to not enough young people signing up ,it going to be #insurancedeathspiral. How will dems spin that?
@Shameonmsnbc Bush's fault, Repubs are racist, and we all hate women, right? ;)
@L_Wheels damn, I forgot  ;).
@L_Wheels that is what I got also - so much for keeping your same - cost more, covers less, new docs. Lie, Lie, Lie
@JonMQuigley Exactly.
@L_Wheels but let us look at the other part - it does help drive us into #debt faster as it is not revenue neutral http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
@L_Wheels Sorry to hear! :(
@MitchBehna Thanks. Me too.
@L_Wheels @MitchBehna Wow, I bet a lot of folks just like you are regretting voting for Liberal Democrats again and again about now.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Liz, you have options...look into them and stop whinging...
@gibsongs The option I chose already is being cancelled because govt says it's not acceptable...do you want govt telling you what to do?
@L_Wheels You still have choices
@L_Wheels OMG, I'm so sorry! I'm so nervous I will get the same thing. I hear people are getting these letters or 10,000. + higher premiums.
@LisaKravits Let me know if you do! Hoping you don't!
@L_Wheels Thanks, I sure will.
@L_Wheels @blackrepublican Keep us informed on process, failures of, etc.
@railboy63 Yeah, will do! Gonna be interesting and probably expensive.
@L_Wheels From everything I've read it's cheaper to pay penalty.
Your coverage isn't being cancelled, your plan is being cancelled. 2 different things. Plans cancelled nothing new.
@L_Wheels 
@SenMikeLee
@MenaceSocietyUT @SenMikeLee Because of Obamacare. The plan *I* chose - not the govt - is cancelled because govt says so.
I've had a plan cancelled by Intermountain Health Care and had to change plans. It happens.
@L_Wheels 
@SenMikeLee
@L_Wheels America does not like a whiner
Since when is righteous indigniation about my rights being violated whining? RT @4neekate: @L_Wheels America does not like a whiner
@L_Wheels you have no rights deal with it
@Brewen Sorry to hear that!
@L_Wheels Oh No! I'm sorry hun. Do u think u can get another carrier without having to sign up for ocare?
@geezaloo I'd rather pay the penalty if it came to that! Lol.
@L_Wheels @geezaloo  Wishy  washy Gov Herbert went with 1/2 Private 1/2 ACA. Talk to HR Dept BlueCross has plans U can switch to without ACA
@L_Wheels @RedheadAndRight send this to @michellemalkin for her twitter collection of HI cancellation
@ksdvm86 @RedheadAndRight @michellemalkin Yeah, I tweeted it to her before! Don't know if she saw it in her busy timeline or not. :)
@L_Wheels @ksdvm86 @RedheadAndRight thank you! got it. my condolences. #ifeelyourpain #ifyoulikeyourplanyouCANTkeepit
@michellemalkin michelle  can we somehow start faxing proof of loss of ins. or increase to whitehouse@L_Wheels @ksdvm86 @RedheadAndRight
@L_Wheels willing to share your story with a news outlet? WND looking for tales of people adversely affected by Obamacare
@L_Wheels Me too. But the good news is my deductible doubled, my premium tripled and the ins. only covers 60% after I pay my deductible.:-(
@L_Wheels @BarbraLWP Lost my insurance and my job because of Obamacare.
@L_Wheels http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-xA3WiL2Xo ‚Ä¶ (Good luck getting coverage)
@L_Wheels @DocWashburn I received a letter about 3 months ago as do my brother   Currently estimated private ins. Triple premium
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee SHOW LETTER!! PROOF!! GO 2 O-CARE INSREAD OF I DON'T CARE
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee : What it is going to do is run the doctors out of business and then the damn gov't take over. "COMMIE"!!
@L_Wheels Not surprising, but I'll be facing the same thing soon too.  Owebama can't tell the truth - his ego won't allow him.
@L_Wheels Yes your PPO was likely canceled and being moved to an HSA plan. It is more consumer driven and incentivizes preventative care.
@L_Wheels @JoeTalkShow wow. Better be checking the mail 4 mine. This Obamacare sucks
@L_Wheels #Greta We all know Obamacare was designed to lead to single payer.
@L_Wheels @DrMartyFox "If you like your health care plan you can keep it" - Barack Hussein Obama..  Repubs should run that video 24/7.
@DonPearson1952 @DrMartyFox @L_Wheels Run the Video then He will blame Big Greedy Business then they will say OH H*LL NO This is what U mndt
@L_Wheels Saw your post on @TwitchyTeam . So sorry to hear of your loss.
@L_Wheels @codeezra I have my ins but rates have increased. I went 2 look@ rates & if I got o-care I'd b $ more than my already high rates
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee heck ya!damn that law enacting min cvg req's&other protections!i hate perfect knowledge leading to perfect competition
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Be careful of that. Use ACA get protect from insur abuses & let your tax $$ help you out for a change.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee If this is real you can act quick & keep w/o ACA protects like no kicking off when your care gets too expen like chemo
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Says: ‚ÄúIf you act quickly, you can keep your coverage with your current plan design...‚Äù But who would want non-ACA?
@L_Wheels #Greta Ouch!!!!!
@L_Wheels nobama is the anti chr-st
@L_Wheels @LdySis #ShareYourNewCare
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee : WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?? My friends daughter two doctors dropped her because of the crazy "ODUMBOCARE".
@L_Wheels @MikeMcGFL Americans voted 4 the fools that gave us the ACA! Now live with those voters poor decision & the ACA or vote them out!
@L_Wheels Oy!
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee I am waiting for mine. So scared to see it. Sorry this is happening to you right now.
@L_Wheels @Buckyworks We'll all be alright at the marxist inncerity plantations. Just got to get use to rape, murder, gangs, hate & despair
@L_Wheels @JoeTalkShow Surprise!!!! Isn't Change Grand!!  -_-
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee I received a similar letter yesterday.
@L_Wheels @DaisyMae84 @gop @Reince @McConnellPress @SpeakerBoehner Way to go RINOs. Another American negatively affect by your inaction.
@L_Wheels @Jn3_16_21 I smell a setup. Cancel your current coverage  to force ACA enrollment. Probly involve kickbacks.
@L_Wheels @JoeTalkShow What will it take for the American People to finally understand that it is Obama' true intent to destroy this nation?
@L_Wheels @JoeTalkShow What will it take for the American People to understand. Obama' true intention is to destroy this nation completely?
#cspanCHAT @L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Why not show the whole letter? As a negative consequence of Obamacare your presentation is unconvincing.
@L_Wheels @youthpastorbry so much for being able to keep your coverage & keep your doctor-I'm sorry for you; you are not alone #MoreLies
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee well it's for the greater good. You pay more and the rest say, "good, good!"
@L_Wheels @DrMartyFox - standard for most of the responsible ones that had/have insurance
@L_Wheels @blackrepublican Oh quit ur whining- The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few...or something.(/sarc)
@L_Wheels @NetAdvisor Feel you pain.  I'm an IBM retiree.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee "If you like your #healthcare you can keep it." NOT. Canceled too. New rate +192% https://twitter.com/NetAdvisor/status/385937539812429824 ‚Ä¶ #ThanksObama
@SpeakerBoehner @SenTedCruz  @SenRandPaul @Senate_GOPs @SenatorReid NOTICE CXLD INSURANCE. PREMIUM +192% #ThanksObama 
@L_Wheels @blackrepublican at a lower rate. The old plan was probably over priced. Research it then comment?
@L_Wheels @blackrepublican I'm waiting for the same to happen. 8 insurance companies have dropped Nebraska coverage.
@L_Wheels @blackrepublican Notice how it says it doesn't meet the requirements then in next sentence says hurry to keep same coverage, $$$$
@L_Wheels @blackrepublican Ugh!! :(
@L_Wheels Practice multiple health degen/dysfunc & accidnt prevention measures+ save 4 unexpected. My practice 4 13 yr w/o "ins" & will cont
@L_Wheels @DrMartyFox Pathetic! Our BC/BS FL increases 60+% beginning 1/1/14 thx to "Affordable Care"
@L_Wheels
Basically @BarackObama #lied when stating:
"errr--umm--if u like ur current health care plan--errr--um--u can keep it"
@theblaze
@L_Wheels @ChristiChat you take the good you take the bad and there you have the facts of socialism
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee Sorry about not being able to keep your plan
@L_Wheels they can not provide new coverage plan if you have an existing plan. They have to cancel a policy to start another. Same user.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee my daughter's policy with Blue Cross got the same letter
@L_Wheels @patrickcrean good luck with that 10,000 deductible! And remember - ITS THE LAW
@L_Wheels @dbongino That is so pitiful I hope America wakes up from its stupor.  It's bad policy not racism that would also b hard for me.
@L_Wheels read the LAST SENTENCE! The new plans have to accommodate MORE options, not less. Sheesh‚Ä¶. (@SenMikeLee
@L_Wheels Too bad. The President's gotta have his law.
@L_Wheels A law sold on the foundation of lies is like a house built upon sand.  In time it cannot stand up to the wind.  So make lots of it
@L_Wheels I got the option to renew my current Blue Cross plan12 months if I paid my December premium. Not sure how that was determined
@L_Wheels #DefundObamacare The current Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare is a tax...#StandWithCruz #epicfail
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee . Right , so who will Obama blame for this one ????  Certainly not the king of teflon's fault...  Act Presidential !!
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee ...people just closed their ears to "Obama'scare" at election time.  I'm so sorry to hear this.  Thx 4 sharing!
@L_Wheels Let me be clear!  You will be able to keep your coverage if you want to.  #bigfatliar
Hey @L_Wheels: you forgot to read the last sentence. Where it said you have until 12/31 to enroll in the same coverage? Shame on you, #hater
@L_Wheels If you need help finding better and more affordable options for your future health insurance plan, let us know. We can help you.
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee They are only changing the coverage plan because they have to adjust. They are offering you a new plan, why not taking
@L_Wheels stop the crying and go by Obamacare and get on with your life
@L_Wheels @SenMikeLee I do believe that there are spambots in here that's keep tweeting the same old garbage
@L_Wheels @avik so either your plan didn't cover essential benefits, they wanted to raise your rates, or they're just saying that.
@L_Wheels Liz, you must be mistaken... I mean... uh... you can keep your coverage... right?  Just write them back and explain it to them!
@L_Wheels @RightCandidates welcome to health care reform aka socialized medicine
@L_Wheels @RightCandidates I would imagine that this is happening to millions here in America. Nobama is determined to destroy America.
@L_Wheels But are you losing healthcare coverage?
@L_Wheels got the same "form" letter from my ins Humana they can help alright but a new improved (gag) plan raises my premium over 500 mo.
@L_Wheels We appreciate you doing your part and paying/sacrificing your fair share. <end sarc> liberal middle america luvs you
@L_Wheels Gee...& 'he' promised U could keep it....
@L_Wheels we should...everyone start faxingw these papers showing increases  to whitehouse
@L_Wheels LIZ...WE NEED TO START FAXING PROOF OF THE LOSE 9R INCREASES SINCE NO DEMS BLIEVE ITS HAPPENING
@L_Wheels its happening to everyone....but dems dont believe it
@L_Wheels Take the early 12/1/13 renewal & avoid O'care for most of 2014! Even if you get a rate increase, it will be your best option.
@L_Wheels   and ......u voted for obama
@L_Wheels I don't like Obamacare either but it is what it is and costs will go up.
@L_Wheels @edonn84 - ahhh good old BCBS, crappy coverage when you have it, but will pray for it when you can't have it anymore.
@L_Wheels @sheilaaj yet you are the extremist
