@SenMikeLee Please STFU and stop holding the CR hostage to your fringe demands. #TEAliban
@strobist @SenMikeLee Hold the line Senator for working, taxpaying, child rearing, praying Americans. Ignore the lazy, crazy and evil.
@aloysiusmiller @SenMikeLee ... and anyone who is not ultra-conservative, middle aged and white, presumably?
@strobist @SenMikeLee you are implying that those are the lazy and non productive? How characteristically progressive
@SenMikeLee y aren't you yelling louder how John Roberts rewrote bill to make the fine a tax?why would we be 'taxed'on smtng not purchased
@customjewel @senmikelee it's a "fine" tax
@ChuckJackson10 @senmikelee if you heard sebelious on the daily show,she actually slipped and said if Indv's don't buy, just pay the 'FINE'
@SenMikeLee @TriciaNC1 thank you Senator!
@SenMikeLee OBozo does NOT WANT any Bill except unlimited spending. Doesn't care, will declare Marshal Law and do what he wants.
@SenMikeLee Since YOU shut it down Mike, looks to me like YOU are the one "reaching further into our lives", and it's not working well for U
@SenMikeLee @ClosetConservat Thank You for your service to the PEOPLE of our REPUBLIC! ( Mr. President, we are NOT a Democ-racy!!!  )
@SenMikeLee @Pkrbkrmary you go Mike Lee. The tax paying, family rearing, working and praying people of America are behind you.
@SenMikeLee @fostermomMN @WITHDRAWN29 (MILLIONS OF PATRIOTS ARE WITH YOU ALL) AS YOU ARE THE TRUE PATRIOTS 
UNMOVED  BY THE SOCIALIST !
@SenMikeLee @KSTAR102TALK But  the government is reaching into our lives more and more everyday. Who will stop it?
@bethlewis28 @SenMikeLee   Americas have the Bill of Rights & Constitution & the rule of law.  Americas must use these tools.
@KSTAR102TALK @SenMikeLee Yes, but those tools are slow, while the govt usurps our rights quickly. I worry we the people are sol and time.
@SenMikeLee @Shannonw65 stand strong! We are behind you
@missydaysardo @SenMikeLee just heard a "news report" said GOP is backing down don't let that happen! Ludicrous to think raising limit fixes
@Shannonw65 @SenMikeLee MSM will say that. They need to stand strong but continue to offer to negotiate and then do so in good faith
@missydaysardo @SenMikeLee negotiation has come only from the right! That's the problem!
@Shannonw65 @SenMikeLee yes!
@SenMikeLee @crogersc Yep ! Don't Cave To DemBullys !!
@SenMikeLee @Amyloukingery Absolutely!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your continued efforts.  Stand firm.  We the people support you.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce / Stand Fast!  Fight like our lives depend on it, because our lives do depend on it!
@SenMikeLee stay strong, stand strong. we r with you Senator. We stand strong for the heart & soul of America! Never give up never surrender
@SenMikeLee @sjh2222 Even with a partial #shutdown the deficit grows- so the govt needs to cut more in order to balance No room 4 ACA ImmRrm
@SenMikeLee @crogersc Pls hold the line. America & future generations are counting on you guys! You all are our voice #makedclisten
@SenMikeLee @arym58 agree! what happens next #shutdown under #obamacare regime? barricade hospitals?
@SenMikeLee @CAP741776 Every day Congress in session also good example of why TERM LIMITS ARE NECESSARY, esp for monsters like Reid & Pelosi
@SenMikeLee @Catherine4GA Liberals let their emotions rule rational economic thought..thus gov humanitarian mess
@SenMikeLee Proves how critical it is to stop O from hurtingUS. It proves of his spite & hatred of the American people.Thank you Senator Lee
.@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce 

Educate voters on how economy will never recover with part time workers and too many fed workers. No budget!
@SenMikeLee Thank you and Senator Cruz for exposing the treachery of the Left and the Duplicity of the eternal politicians!
@SenMikeLee  Hold the line Senator....We the people support you.
@SenMikeLee I hope you stay strong to give us a voice in this runaway government. You young men and women are our future. Keep that in mind.
Mike I love ya but you don't go far enough. Not about reaching further. It's about getting the hell out of our lives. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee 4 in 10 identify themselves w tea party. It's not a fringe group! The number is prob even higher than that
@SenMikeLee DO NOT BACK DOWN! WE the people ARE behind you!!
@SenMikeLee This is why everyone should want limited gov.  Personal responsibility =Freedom
@SenMikeLee so why don't you resign since govt is the enemy? Why continue to be a part of the problem? #seditiousconspiracy
@SenMikeLee @csham21 Senator, and to get them out of our lives: See Federalist #45.
@SenMikeLee @helensharvest President Obama is using this Shut Down as a Warning to Opponents and as a Model to Supporters is Patiently Clear
@SenMikeLee 
Or into our pockets
@SenMikeLee DOD is still refusing to pay death benefits to our fallen US warrior families. What does that say about Obama's immortal soul?
@SenMikeLee Fight On Senator! USA is Behind You Sleeping GIANT is Awake we see the BS from Beltway We Know UR standing=2014GOP @AtlOBrien

@SenMikeLee @LilSouthernSass Well said Sir!!  #WeThePeople
@SenMikeLee @RCamsore Are any dumbass Americans even remembering the IRS will be running Obamadeathcare?
@jasondecker55 @SenMikeLee Would people perk up if we changed it to Nazicare? Just compare it with Hitler's.
@SenMikeLee @southsalem Keep fighting for the RIGHTS of the AMERICAN PEOPLE.  LAST CHANCE to KEEP what's OURS!
@SenMikeLee MIGHTY Lion ROARS...ROARS louder..with outrage...Much Shame on AMERICA...
@SenMikeLee @southsalem Such a vindictive & petty power as the US govt is, in charge of our health care, ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIES me! #Ccot
@SenMikeLee the shutdown has shown that the federal bureaucracy is headed by sadists. As a nation, we'd be insane to given them more power.
@SenMikeLee @onewhitetiger expose Obama he just gave #pbs  millions! Then hires thugs to scare #tourists
@SenMikeLee @coff33loveit - Any able person who DEPENDS on govt is a fool!
"ABLE" key word GOP MUST USE! @grandpa_jimbo @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @coff33loveit - COULD NOT AGREE MORE!
@SenMikeLee Amen sir
@SenMikeLee @glockster23 I'm OK with shut down until Election Day. Just refuse to fuel up AF1 or mow the grass at Andrews AFB/country club
@SenMikeLee @Csinaco When they get out of my life, I hope they take their hands out of my pockets. A bunch of petty thieves.
@SenMikeLee @Csinaco #holdtheline
@SenMikeLee @Csinaco Senator , do you know anything about a back door amnesty? Keep up the fight I support you.
@SenMikeLee @RBPundit Stay strong. Americans are behind you.
@SenMikeLee Go to hell. Each day of #shutdown is a reminder why I can’t stand you and how far YOU reach into our lives. Congratulations.
@SenMikeLee @StarfireSue Each day of #shutdown keeps #GOPAMNESTYPLAN from passing.

@SenMikeLee What a Statesman... happy and gleeful to talk to Dictatorships but refuses to talk to Congress on principle
@SenMikeLee Young healthy people are not going to support this "trainwreck"--it's over. Really. They just don't know it yet. #obamacaresucks
@SenMikeLee @LaydiHD shut the whole thing down who needs Gov. fire every 1

@SenMikeLee It is so scary to me that we're being told we can't pay our bills without borrowing more money. We already borrowd $17T. Enough?

@SenMikeLee @FedUpJoe 
The Shutdown, by #ThemDemLibs design, is only showing the most visible and shallowest of spending.
@SenMikeLee  Is it Because you have a lot of lies in your past. You are no J Bracken Lee,  more like the Mountain Meadows massacre Lee !
@SenMikeLee @debjnich @Theblaze  they don't LIE and they will even break it down for you.
@SenMikeLee if you really believe what you're saying and it's not merely messaging, your cognitive dissonance is at psychopathic levels.
@SenMikeLee @3Quarters2Day Obama continues to hold US Constitution hostage#shutdown

@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Downsize Govt. just like most Americans have had to do.
@SenMikeLee You are Washington, Mike. Why not #JustVote ? You don't speak for all of us. You were elected by your State alone. #GOPshutdown
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Amen Mr. Lee!
.@SenMikeLee I so agree. This display should warn us all: Giving a vindictive government power over our health choices is a grave mistake.
@SenMikeLee @tedcruz @SenRandPaul Take the Hill, men! We're behind you guys. #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee #RedNationRising #NoSpecialTreatment #FairnessForAll
.@SenMikeLee Each Day of #HarryReidsShutdown shows us how unnecessary much of #FedGov really is. #CutSpending and #defundObamacare #shutdown
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks I'm liking the smaller fed government, but, not presidential heavy handedness to make us hurt! #ImpeachObamanow!
@SenMikeLee Keep your line. Keep fighting for/with us. They need to know that they work for US. We are their employers.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks I'm so proud to have Mike Lee as one of our leaders.
@SenMikeLee or run our parks, beaches, memorials, etc #SpiteHouse #limited_Government
@SenMikeLee Because you're all incapable of acting reasonably and rationally? Or because you're all power-hungry monsters who don't care?
@SenMikeLee keep up the fight to shrink gov. Work to get rid of dept of Ed, small biz, and all these other do nothing good offices #tcot
@SenMikeLee Each day of the Shutdown gives the people you claim to represent more of a reason to not vote for you.  #EndTheShutdownNOW
@SenMikeLee You LOVE government intrusion into peoples lives - especially through their genitals.Senator,you are the worst kind of hypocrite
@SenMikeLee Thank you Sen Lee..for doing the job we sent you there TO DO! You are standing TALL..We appreciate that!
@SenMikeLee do not give in
@SenMikeLee Eliminating the for profit health insurance companies might be a good start or do it like the Germans do it:
@SenMikeLee Keep spines straight! Why can the people b kicked out of their houses if they had a lease? wouldn't the lease have been paid?
@SenMikeLee stay strong #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz STAND YOUR GROUND! Do not back down. Obama must be stopped& ideally impeached. Plz keep fighting on 4us!
MT @SenMikeLee: Each day of #shutdown brings a new example of why it's critical that we not allow Washington to reach further into our lives
@SenMikeLee Yet despite Elephants battle cry of small government, every year we get more laws more rules. Your actions discredit your ideal.
@SenMikeLee There will be an event SOON and obama will officially declare MARTIAL LAW (in place already).!
Watch: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-7EIW4e_xBQ … …

@SenMikeLee 
Why do you think obama will not U-TURN on abamacare? It's by ORDER of rothschild-illuminati obamacare is THEIR program!

.@SenMikeLee "The ultimate goal of collectivism is not universal service, but rather a transfer of power to the ruling elite." @rrt00004
@SenMikeLee When will you begin the fight to amend the Constitution to rein in the malignant metastatic federal aristocracy ?
@SenMikeLee Keep standing firm Senator.  We're behind you, and we can see the various shutdown shenanigans for what they are.
@SenMikeLee Each day also shows they've already reached too far into our lives.
@RedBrightandTru @SenMikeLee @SpeakerBoehner Each day is a day to identify what agency, office, or "service" to keep closed permanently. TY
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work Senator Lee,Missourians appreciate everything you are doing for our country.
@SenMikeLee Aren't supposed to be committee voting or something?
@SenMikeLee Thank you sir!
@SenMikeLee HOLD THE LINE
@keepingmyguns @SenMikeLee praise GOD from Whom.......
