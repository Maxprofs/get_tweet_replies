Effective criticism of ObamaCare must accompany a specific alternative Free Market proposal. @SenMikeLee @genita101
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea We must remind the American People of the harmful effects of RINOS in our Party. They are power hungry zealots.
@SenMikeLee @stix1972 Howabout reminding them DEMS know nothing as a CLEAN BILL.  McConnell-Reid $3 Billion Earmark http://goo.gl/fb/3PBm9  ”
@SenMikeLee We must remind the American people of the harmful effects of #TeaPartyTraitors if we are ever going to see the country prosper
@SenMikeLee @tjoy7 Agree. Also, remind people that the Dems & Prez alone - with no Repub support - created and endorsed it!
@SenMikeLee You're right! Let's start by pointing out that people with pre-existing health problems will actually get medical care!
@SenMikeLee And as we all know, Jesus wouldn't want people avoiding unnecessary pain and suffering.
@SenMikeLee You just funded it, so how are you going to repeal the train wreck now
@SenMikeLee We are still here behind.with you! It's a GOOD FIGHT keep it up!
@SenMikeLee B4 a bad law can be repealed it must be vigorously enforced so everyone will feel the pinch #noexemptions
@SenMikeLee I think they'll be reminded when they get online, get their #obamacare account.....oh, wait. #404 @DecisionZero
@schwingcat @SenMikeLee indeed !
@SenMikeLee now I say to hell with them. Let them eat #Obamacare now.  I will not sign up. Will pay the fine,I mean tax,no fine ,
@customjewel @SenMikeLee As for my wife and I, we will not comply with ObamaCare.  We are prepared to go to jail B4 we give in to tyranny
@B1gHorn @senmikelee if U go to jail,you will get free health care lol
@customjewel @SenMikeLee u know prisoners will be denied nothin under ObamaCare but the average Joe will be rationed to death. Freaking Libs
@SenMikeLee @Jim_Peoples_ What about the harmful effects of Obama himself?? Do something REALLY important & start impeachment proceedings!!
@SenMikeLee As someone who enrolls people in ObamaCare, I can tell you they do not like it already. It will collapse on its own. #Trainwreck
@SenMikeLee @BarbieHitsBack As I recall, both @McConnellPress & @SpeakerBoehner promised repeal of #Obamacare Liars both
@SenMikeLee @Al_Gorelioni They will prop it up to have enough votes for Dems locked in until collapse. Then of course, blame Reps for truth.
@VonnieOpn @SenMikeLee Amen
@SenMikeLee Thanks Sen Lee.  We know we can count on u to do what's right for America.
@DrMiguelPestana @SenMikeLee We sure can!  http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-defund-obamacare-181906962.html …
@SenMikeLee @SkyeShepard Mike U may not be able to respond to this Subject Matter, Leak from high Hill R-Chip be required 4 OB-careNoChipNoC
@SenMikeLee No preexisting conditions. Equal coverage regardless of gender. Kids allowed to remain on Ins until 26. Fewer uninsured.
@SenMikeLee what is sad is how ignorance by you and your #teaparty cohorts runs rampant. OR you are purposely misleading ur ignorant base.
@SenMikeLee please remind me again.
@SenMikeLee Are you going to tell your constituents that you wasted $24 billion with your political stunt?
@SenMikeLee Translation: We must lie to the American ppl about Obamacare every opportunity we get.
Please, remind us of the "harmful effects" of having health insurance vs not having health insurance.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee only to producers see the takers want more. Immigration plans will tip the scales for the next 40 years. We may never recover.
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 Thank you for standing with the American people!
@SenMikeLee like less disposable$ within 24 months- go Perot with charts carry them everywhere you interview
Stay strong and courageous.
@SenMikeLee @lambodiablo91 In about 6 months, you won't have to remind them, they will know.  But for those getting subsidies, it might work
@SenMikeLee preventative care, not excluding people for pre-existing conditions, and women's health=all "harmful" things
@SenMikeLee wait til they sign up, they will figure it out!! #DefundObamacare #DefundObamaAndMichelle #ImpeachObama
@SenMikeLee counting on your leadership to continue this fight for we the people
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler They will see it for themselves when they see it's not FREE. Let it implode.
@profilerjr @SenMikeLee  And implode, it will.  The establishment just has to do it the hard way.
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 im sure major personal info hole to leak US. tax payers info US will all need new SS# After this debacle crashes US

@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 Too Bad @SenOrrinHatch doesn't listen to the people like you do. #VoteOutHatch
.@SenMikeLee We must remind the People that the US Gov't and Federal Reserve has USURPED our Liberty and Replaced it with Debt Slavery.
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 looks like ppl will need 2 experience it & even then @SenBobCorker & @SenJohnMcCain will blame probs on you & Cruz
@SenMikeLee Remind them? Oh they are going to really feel this one at home. They are about to be awakened. Just like the sleeping giant.
@SenMikeLee These guys are trying 2 paint Americans as enemies 2 be done away with. It is a quiet coup which will turn even more radical
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 whatever!  We are suffering and past breaking point and you fools caved
@SenMikeLee You can't just remind of "harmful effects" of the AHCA but go beyond to the national heart of the matter, a tyrannical take over
.@SenMikeLee Thank you, Senator Lee. @fearlesswidow
@SenMikeLee Really Mike, I'd expect you to be settling in for long snooze but here u r, fighting onward! Thank U! @Al_Gorelioni
@SenMikeLee RT CALL @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader NOW 1-202-224-3121 "NO NEW DEBT" No #TreasonAMNESTY No #TreasonCARE No #TreasonDEBT #TEAPARTY
@SenMikeLee We won't HAVE to remind them about harmful effects of #Obamacare.  They will soon see for themselves!  Some already have...
@SenMikeLee @sheilaaj 1 thing is for sure. No matter how bad it is (& it is) MSM and CNN will laude it like it is FABulous!
@SenMikeLee @sheilaaj Not 2 mention they will probably throw in some bogus poll #s to try to convince the sheeple how much everyone luvs it.
@SenMikeLee Thank you Mike Lee for standing with Americans and Vets!
@SenMikeLee @snarkfetish it won't get repealed ever. You can thank your spineless colleagues for that.
The @GOP bought it with this debt deal.  This was our last chance to rid ourselves of it. @ineed2takeatwit @SenMikeLee @snarkfetish
@se_george @GOP @SenMikeLee @snarkfetish agreed.
@SenMikeLee @GirlPainting Well, us American ppl won't need reminding. We will be living it. You guys won't cos you don't have it
@SenMikeLee You make me want to vomit
@SenMikeLee Hopefully, they won't need reminding. They'll be living it every day! #ObamaCareFailure
@SenMikeLee thank you for your effort
@SenMikeLee Thank You for fighting.
@SenMikeLee what world are you living in ?
@SenMikeLee  Sure, keep reminding us, but the sad truth is we'll be living it. Yes, it has to be repealed.
@SenMikeLee But it's not going to mean anything if they win every fight, even when they shouldn't and when they control the media
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work the support is not too visible but it is here.
@SenMikeLee http://healthcare.gov  is doing that nicely.
@SenMikeLee thank you Senator Lee for all your work.  You are a great patriot and American.
@SenMikeLee @SandyMcPalmieri  How can we forget how stupid you really are. Climb out of your hole and see that you are the new  minority.
@SenMikeLee thank you Sen. Lee you are one of the few that stands for his principles
@SenMikeLee we in new jersey need more people like you, ted, and rand.
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea we need to remind the Senate of obamacaid harmful effect by voting out the money spenders who would enslave us
@SenMikeLee We are with you! #tcot

@SenMikeLee Th problm is, nt gtting it defunded is going 2 prove 2 b our end n undoing!
@SenMikeLee That helps no one, including those you're trying to protect from Obamacare.  Just move on to other business.  There's plenty.
@SenMikeLee Yes &We need 2stop focusing on only the econ effect's & YELL more about the real reason for it! 'FundTransformationOfAmerica'
@SenMikeLee mike they will see oh they will see
@SenMikeLee @ChrisBentonTenn its the Affordable Health Care Act, quit pandering and get a jobs bill done.
@SenMikeLee or  work on a Student Loan bill. Or rework disability and how that's decided.  or keep pandering and go back to a real job
.@SenMikeLee Sometimes you lose the battle but win the war. Obamacare will speak for itself
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up for America.
@SenMikeLee first start by getting a Majority in the Senate #electionsmatter
@SenMikeLee @barbie124h I would be embarrassed to sit on your side of the aisle tomorrow. Send our disdain to McCain.
@SenMikeLee Agree 100% Sir, but certain members in your party@SenJohnMcCain need to retire or change parties with all do respect to McCain
@SenMikeLee #cspanchat Your arguments against Obamacare would be persuasive if the lachchromose anecdotes could be shown to be credible.
@SenMikeLee @irishspy O-cares' ugly effects will be clear 'nuf to those watching. I worry more about how it will be solved w/MORE of same.
@SenMikeLee Ty, Sir, 4 all you do. We will fight harder. God is on our side! Bless you!
@SenMikeLee the sad thing is, the Obama idiots deserve what they get with ACA, the rest of us r sucked into it.
@SenMikeLee you misspelled "never going to see ot repealed.
@SenMikeLee Tnxs for fight'n the good fight.If more plp in DC would stand on principle,maybe it wouldn't be a den of scum and villiany. :P
@SenMikeLee. We the people hear you and soon all of Washington will hear form we the people… (~_•)
@SenMikeLee  I  know we need to get the republicans slugs out of office starting with McConnell , McCain  Graham and on and on both houses
@SenMikeLee agreed! And thay SS is not entitlement. The ppl and employers paid into it NOT govt. It is our money not govt #TCOT
@SenMikeLee The grassroots formed the Republican Party because Whigs too wimpy to fight Slavery. Today r fight is corruption! #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Better to remind politicians of the effect the #GOPshutdown had on us. Work w/ no pay = bullshit!
@SenMikeLee   Luckily, the word is spreading quickly. a LOT of my clients are waiting in dread to the THE letter from their ins company.
@SenMikeLee pretty sure we will experience it for ourselves, unfortunately. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @TimGamble Maybe stop creating colossal distractions then?
@SenMikeLee how is that exchange thing going. Oh that's right they do not want to tell us for a whole month. I guess not so well
@SenMikeLee We must remind Americans of the harmful effects of the Tea Party (aka John Birch Society) at every opportunity. #p2 #tcot
@SenMikeLee #Obamacare has been the biggest jobs killer in US history
@SenMikeLee We must point out  the

$2 Billion #McConnellBribe for brokering budget deal
Call the House
Stop the deal
http://wfpl.org/post/mcconnell-reid-deal-includes-2-billion-earmark-kentucky-project …
@SenMikeLee Not enough patriots in the conservative ranks. Too many RINOS dilute our strength. Thank you & @SenTedCruz & a few others.
@SenMikeLee As a wise pundit said today, "we don't have the media on our side so the GOP has to get out the message ( ) times more."
@SenMikeLee You have to win elections not take hostages. You cost our economy $25B in 16 days. Fool. Utter fool.
@SenMikeLee Jill you are blind. Remind me to send you and "I told you so" in a years time...or less
@bradcooney1 @SenMikeLee If you can't, I'll be happy to do it for you!
@SenMikeLee Maybe we should get a more effective strategy, too.
@SenMikeLee The war is over! You might as well raise the "Stars and Bars" start whistling Dixie and  shout "The Right Will Rise Again"!
@SenMikeLee Yesterday POTUS exempted himself by threatening to veto Sen. Vitter's Amend. The American people will remember that in Nov. 14.
@SenMikeLee That was not a reference to you Senator.
@SenMikeLee I am in the medical field and have been warning people since It's inception.
@SenMikeLee thanks for you and mr Cruz hold them responsible we haven t lost yet. We are the people.
@SenMikeLee What we need to keep doing is to not only remind people, but remind people that the people have never supported BOCare.
@SenMikeLee we are very much damaged.
@SenMikeLee As I plan to remind everyone the harmful effects of your shutdown every chance I get.
@SenMikeLee Thank you so much for being our voice of reason.  Stay strong and keep up the good fight.  God Bless You!
@SenMikeLee we got your six mike  lets roll!,
@SenMikeLee We should also take advantage of this time to remind them of the harmful effects of voting for idiots.
@SenMikeLee just as you tried to do during the August recess, while the "leadership" tried to cut your legs out from underneath you
@SenMikeLee I surely hope you get a chance, because conservatives have lost the media.
@avrilionis @SenMikeLee Nobody watches lamestream media.
