.@repjustinamash @gopfirecracker And Constitution also says President may veto funding bills.
@gracels @repjustinamash @gopfirecracker & that we may impeach the president.
.@retakethestate @repjustinamash @gopfirecracker Oh, Lord, here comes impeachment talk again. Do you really know what grounds are?
@gracels @repjustinamash @gopfirecracker Oh honey, how long have u got?
@retakethestate All the time in the world, sugar.
@gracels Give me email address, I'll send u a list. Let's start tho w/ selectively enforcing laws, #FastandFurious, punishing whistleblowers
@retakethestate One at a time. Where does each fit in Constitution? Let's go with selective enforcement.
@gracels U'r familiar w/ Pres Oath of Office?
ACA passed in both houses, Congressman. MT @repjustinamash Constitution: Congress decides programs will be funded & amount of funding.
@repjustinamash Do you believe your own B.S.? Or do you just hope that we do? @MIGOP @GOP #GOPshutdown #teaparty Spinnin every excuse #MIGOP
@nancysue41 @repjustinamash @MIGOP @GOP So the TRUTH is now BS. Love how Libs keep redefining words. Murder/choice; fact/BS #tcot #lnyhbt
@repjustinamash @rbostick12 Congress has conceded too much power to the president! Especially an incompetent, dishonest, tyrant president!
.@Furnkranz Cheney said in an interview that he & Bush deliberately concentrated power in the exec --  it's not just Obama. @rbostick12
@cassandrab784 @Furnkranz AMEN to that. It's been going on for decades R's and D's complicit. GH BUSH one world order on down.
@rbostick12 @cassandrab784 I think more & more of our politicians are selling US out over the years for their own personal profit & power!
@Furnkranz @cassandrab784 For principles in all fairness. There's not ours. They believe in commie principles disdain ours.
@rbostick12 @Furnkranz @cassandrab784 Socialism, communism appealing to lazy leaders incapable of positive results! Make US same & oppress!
@repjustinamash @BerinSzoka right, so Congress decided to fund ACA and then not fund the government...so this is squarely on Congress.
@sinkerinthedirt One Congress can't force the next to continue appropriating money. That's just not how it works. @repjustinamash
@BerinSzoka @repjustinamash and they aren't, the senate maintains funding of the law. Holding the rest of funding hostage is irresponsible
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee The Constitution is quite clear that the President's signature is required. You two are truly special.
“@repjustinamash: Constitution: Congress decides which programs will be funded & amount of funding.
Pres Obama: No.” Constitution>President
.@repjustinamash @ladydshops We R a Constitutional REPUBLIC, not under the whim of a dictator. Obama needs 2 grow up. #PresidentStompyFoot
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee - Congress funded ObamaCare. GOP says no to everything else because they don't like ObamaCare. GOP logic.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee but you can't get your crazy proposals through both houses of congress...
@repjustinamash @BerinSzoka Constitution says House, Senate and a President must agree on what to fund. Must work together
@repjustinamash The Chief Executive has a problem with English comprehension. #Constitution
@repjustinamash needs a "Schoolhouse Rock" refresher...Reopen govt & get Boehner to appoint budget conferees #ThisIsReal #CR #DebtCeiling

@repjustinamash Congress: Does Congress adjudicate the Constitutionality of existing laws?
Constitution: Nope, that's the SCOTUS's job.

@repjustinamash Just wanted to let you know I appreciate everything you are doing and support you! God bless you! #MakeDCListen
@repjustinamash @pikester45 Obama does as he pleases and House and Senate lets him do it. Why hasen't he been Impeached
@repjustinamash Remind and encourage Boehner!
@repjustinamash Ellis is gonna help you to the unemployment line.  Tea party lackey
“@repjustinamash: Constitution: Congress decides which programs will be funded & amount of funding.
Pres Obama: No.”
@repjustinamash people spoke, Supreme Court spoke, Congress/House spoke. Your anarchist actions are hurting real people. #GOPshutdown
@repjustinamash @gnudarwin - the American people want to pay you piecemeal for actual work performed. Like factory workers get paid.
@itsweezie Isn't that abit of an outrageous exaggeration and bad metaphor? He asking for good accounting practices. @repjustinamash
@repjustinamash Spending Bills start in the house,so how did we end up with Obama care? Crammed through the senate
@repjustinamash you may explain your votes but that doesn't mean we agree with them in mich dist 3. So happy w mi GOP wants to primary you

@repjustinamash where does the constitution say the US can skip paying for debts the US CONGRESS authorized? Man up and do the right thing.
@repjustinamash @3sons4me2  I only pray republicans understand the power of their position.  House gets to decide who gets paid.
@repjustinamash "No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law."
@repjustinamash @rbostick12 Please start the impeachment process sir O's transgressions are egregious & must be stopped
@AlexisinVT @repjustinamash @rbostick12 unfortunately impeachment starts in Senate and we all know that'll never happen w/ Reid
@ChrisHubler @AlexisinVT @repjustinamash Reid is on the way out. No doubt in my mind.
@rbostick12 @ChrisHubler @repjustinamash Agreed He is a disgrace & has no business being a rep of the people
@repjustinamash @Mama_4_Liberty Evidently, our "Constitutional Law Professor in Chief" missed that day in class.
@SenMikeLee :@repjustinamash: RT: Constitution: Congress decides which programs will be funded & amount of funding. Pres Obama: No.
@repjustinamash @jonzies Checks & balances ..Obama can't raise debt ceiling as though it were an executive branch prerogative.
@repjustinamash you are correct.  So just pass a damn budget.
@repjustinamash @bzaz This is exactly why they won't pass a budget, No constraints where the money goes!! No more Spending sprees!
«@gopfirecracker «@repjustinamash Constitution: Congress decides which programs will be funded & amount of funding.
Pres Obama: No.»»
@repjustinamash @FreedomWorks that's because he cares about what he wants not the American values.
@repjustinamash Astounding hypocrisy. History will judge you and your gang for betraying the country.
@repjustinamash @CHetterick This feeling of absolute power Obama has must be stopped!  #WeThePeople > #ObamasEgo
@repjustinamash @FreedomWorks Yep @garcels that's why they negotiate.Neither side has absolute power,nor should they.
@repjustinamash @FreedomWorks Then FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT!!! Ever hear of MALFEASANCE OF OFFICE?!
@repjustinamash @FreedomWorks
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee How's that working for you?
@repjustinamash @FreedomWorks ABSOLOUTLEY!  Enough said....
@repjustinamash pass a law or it doesn't count
@repjustinamash Hear ! Hear ! We are thankful for Congressmen like you, Sir !
@repjustinamash Where in the constitution does it mention holding the government hostage when you lose elections? Pass a clean CR, you hack.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee indeed, this scandal ridden president keeps having daily learning experiences. Community organizer politics/pot?
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee thank you from Michigan.
@repjustinamash Unfortunately, the Constitution doesn't matter to this usurper in the oval office nor the puppets in congress.
@repjustinamash New week, new lame excuse for the shutdown. Also, presentment clause.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee Boehner: No.
@repjustinamash Did you try telling @BarackObama this?
That wld be inconvenient.RT@repjustinamash Constitution: Congress decides which programs will be funded & amount of funding. Pres Obama: No.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee Pres has absolutely no interest in what Constitution says. Hello?
@repjustinamash Hey,  it's Bo's party and he'll lie if he wants to.   Never mind,  you are too young to get it.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee Exactly.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee #PresidentStompyFoot at work
@repjustinamash The legislative loses more of power day by day.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee The citizens are required to follow the law .We just ask the same of #SenDemocrats #HarryReidsShutdown
@repjustinamash congress needs to do what's GOOD FOR AMERICA -- republicans are killing america and risking american jobs and the economy
@repjustinamash obama is having to parent his idiot republican kids in congress who haven't learned right from wrong
@repjustinamash that's because the republicans in congress are acting like fussy children about an argument they lost
@repjustinamash easy for a #kamikazecaucus member to tweet.
@repjustinamash He's a Vindictive Son Of A Gun, isn't he?
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee Precedent for restoring regular order & end of ‘omnibus’ spending bills = another benefit of “piecemeal” bills
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee Sure just ignore the Senate, it's not really a part of Congress anyway, it's definitely @BarackObama.
@repjustinamash until we pass a prioritized budget, there should be no more blanket CR's for discretionary spending. NO BLANK CHECKS.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee But Justin..isn't that fascist? #tcot @Senate_GOPs @gopconference @oreiIIyfactor @seanhannity
@repjustinamash have you respect for billing and payment obligations? we are world leader not chiseling flakes
@repjustinamash the past is over work on cutting future spending
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee Constitution: All taxes start in the House/Reps.
John Roberts & Obamacare: lol, yeah right.
@repjustinamash once spending is approved and spent, it has to be paid, no redeciding or refusing at that point there must be sure process
@repjustinamash Per the constitution THE HOUSE IS WHERE THIS ALL STARTS!!!!
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee C'mon. He's the King.
@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee, "Congress" implies majority agreement. One-sided attempt to ram through is not agreement.
@repjustinamash You can at least admit the Tea Party has the whole country by the balls & why no mention of self immolation at National Mall
The House decides...Senate and Prez then decide if they want to go along...@repjustinamash @SenMikeLee
@repjustinamash The president also has veto power. Civics 101! Please don't insult our intelligence, you are smart enough to know better.
The rise of lawlessness.@repjustinamash Constitution: Congress decides which programs will be funded & amount of funding. Pres Obama: No.
@repjustinamash Remember the statement "Presidents budget is dead on arrival" has been a mainstay in the press for fifty years.
@repjustinamash I thought it was Sen. Reid who said that.
@repjustinamash with a two thirds vote if the President disagrees with funding amount, Yes, indeed.
@repjustinamash I wonder what he thot he was doing when he was in Congress then.
@repjustinamash 
Republicans: HURR DURR 'MURICA STALL PROGRESS
Obama: Let's actually get meaningful things done!
@repjustinamash Shutdown veiling an assault on Separation of Powers, oversight, & the budgetary authority of Congress
