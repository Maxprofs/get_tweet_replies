Darn right @SenMikeLee @PatriotCzar ..but @McConnellPress said on Nov 5 we would NOT shut down Govt? Bad as Obama saying what we won't do
yep - all options should be on the table - including the nuclear option of imprison... I mean "Impeachment" :) @LUVofCountry @SenMikeLee
@PatriotCzar @LUVofCountry @SenMikeLee if they were to uphold their oath it would be imprisonment
The higher your status in the public trust, the harsher the penalty should be for betraying that trust. @CRKittle @LUVofCountry @SenMikeLee
You should have done that last October against ObamaCare.. . @SenMikeLee @michael_mosher
@SenMikeLee @instapundit No more talking about doing things. Do it.
@DCinAZ @SenMikeLee @instapundit They can't and won't try to do anything.
@SenMikeLee Amen! Absolutely!
@SenMikeLee you are on target. Keep up the pressure on other Republicans! We need to keep our country's laws.
@Nick_LosAngeles @GOP I agree with you. ....we have awesome people waiting in the wings @tedcruz @TGowdySC @SenatorMikeLee.
@SenMikeLee @gegco that power can be used to fix so many things.  They must find the will to do so.
@SenMikeLee @SHA457 Please, save our military! Get rid of budget cuts for military!
@SenMikeLee @instapundit If you are going to hit someone with a purse put a brick in it
@SenMikeLee perhaps restoring our constitutional roghts should be first priority since yall actually took an oath to uphold it @wakeup1442
@CRKittle @SenMikeLee They have completely thrown out Constitution & the Republic. And Obama expects us to go along with that?
@wakeup1442 @SenMikeLee shoot repubs have too all they are talking about are pipelines aca and immigration reform.
@SenMikeLee @gegco Prosecute lawlessness. Go after Holder, Scandals, Jarrett, Obama, his attorneys
Fight 'em @SenMikeLee

cc: @instapundit
@SenMikeLee republicans need to call the Sergeant At Arms to arrest Obama the second he breaches his oath in defiance of the Constitution
@SenMikeLee @instapundit Why is @SpeakerBoehner saying he's going to file a useless lawsuit? NO. That is NOT an acceptable course of action.
@SenMikeLee @landau_byron Please call, email and send postcards of support to Rep. Lee. http://www.house.gov/representatives/ …
@LiveFreeorDie3 @SenMikeLee OK
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  @SeanHannith You are a sour puss Koch Sucker
@SenMikeLee Obama belongs in prison. The GOP needs to get the guts and courage to stop his intentional destruction of everything America.
@r1965rainey @usarubric @BettinaVLA @JoAnnEileen @SenMikeLee he's doing a great job thanks to the RINOs and communist in congress "Gutless"
@SenMikeLee 
Impeach Obama For Not Faithfully Executing The Laws Of The United States, That Includes Immigration Laws!!
mt"@SenMikeLee: Republicans need to be prepared to exercise the power of the purse to prevent #ExecutiveAmnesty: http://youtu.be/uV1aNRK_7Hw ”
@SenMikeLee @BeanfromPa But they wont, love their big govt.
@SenMikeLee @PolitiBunny BHO is spitting in the face of Americans that voted for a new direction Tuesday..he's dangerous and divisive
@SenMikeLee @slone - they also need to be ready to kick @SpeakerBoehner out on his ass of he even tries to push amnesty. #LNYHBT
@SenMikeLee  and if it takes shutting down Godzilla to kill Obama's illegal alien fiesta then shut down Godzilla #NoAmnesty
@SenMikeLee @NicolePickler Obama was a Constitutional scholar? He has to know he's a fraud. Sen Lee is the Constitutional scholar. #tcot
@SenMikeLee You caved on the budget already.
@SenMikeLee @vmpcott 
#GOP should also put Dems on defense by stating Dems would block impeachment.
@SenMikeLee @Herfarm Senator, I wish it were true, but with current leadership in both houses it will never happen. Amnesty is a given.
@SenMikeLee @slone Yes, defund every program that Obozo wants.. especially the Immigration attempt at exec order.. also illegal!!
@SenMikeLee @TruthGunner YYYYYEEEESSSSSS PPPPPLLLLLEEEAAASSEEEEE!!!!
@justmetmc @SenMikeLee   If this doesn't work, we need to make a national citizen's arrest and thro obama in prison
@SenMikeLee Senator, you're more than just one Republican, you're a member of the US Senate, so please take a stand and begin fighting.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz YEAH! Debating is hard! Just shut it all down, and hope it starts back up, like a computer!
@SenMikeLee Or you could exercise your power to read the Constitution and notice that it forbids Congress to regulate immigration, full stop
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Legal action he can take is to execute the immigration laws.
@SenMikeLee @jeanniemcbride great post. What can I do?
@SenMikeLee @TEXASSHEBANDIT they also need to keep the power of #impeachment handy to prevent him from continually ignoring #laws
@SenMikeLee @jeanniemcbride  cut the money and jobs and they'll go back
@SenMikeLee @RedNationRising  Yes Yes Yes....We have to stop the lunacy and the bleeding...#tea
.@SenMikeLee .@RedNationRising You better make the language COMPREHENSIVE bc HE'LL FIND SOME LOOPHOLE SOMEWHERE! i.e. "NOTHING OF VALUE"!!!
@SenMikeLee @ChapmanNancy A nice idea,but since they no longer have any "power of the purse," b/c FED prints money,public outcry might help
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Lee, your just another #stooge  STFU and think for your self and don't be a Teddy Cruz lemming...
@SenMikeLee @ConsrvativeDiva they had better be ready to deal with nonsense that will goad them to the quick,it's opposite Tuesday next 2yrs
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Oh please. Two terrible wars, the patriot act, largest terror attack ever, economic ruin. Now you need to fix shit?
@SenMikeLee @cautiousone1 like not accepting gifts&under table donations...
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz That's your answer to literally everything, isn't it?
It's not like we vote on things in this country or something.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Oh, so basically Republicans need to buy more politicians. Power of the purse? Check for wolf bites. #WolfPAC
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz except where military corporations are concerned.., where you profit from the death of soldier? Then discard them...
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz cut to the bone so we can look like Europe. I will short the market.
You should be taken out of Congress wirh Ted Cruz in a straitjacket ,@SenMikeLee ... #ThisIsaFactualStatement
May I spank him first? It's clear his Mom & Dad fell down on the job. @southerntalker @marcianhgirl @SenMikeLee <== Piece of SHIT.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Obama is going to do the right thing, the reason he lost was not taking decision earlier.
@SenMikeLee @tarafdavis sen don't wait on barry obama do something now!
@SenMikeLee @MaxCUA Best spend a little face time with public so they appreciate the tactic as a Constitutionally mandated tool.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz return the power of the purse to the REAL distributors... The states! ABOLISH THE 16th Amendments!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz End the private, corrupt piracy of the Federal Reserve and ABOLISH the 16th Amendment. We have the ability to vote.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz And to stop @barackobama from getting U.S taxes from Congress for ISIS and it goes to the enemy..b/c of weak plan
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #powerofthepurse that is the stupidest thing I've heard this year to stop amnesty! But wait this is the GOP!
@SenMikeLee @Cate_Tweeting Sign of what's to come if in 2014 lame duck session O sends troops to Iraq, appoints AG nominee, and EO's amnesty

@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Impeach @SenMikeLee and @SenTedCruz !!!
@SenMikeLee @lesstaxingcpa Republicans must use power of purse for many situations of OBAMA over reach & Illegal corrupt behavior
@SenMikeLee  When 1/3 of the country votes, you win, when 50%+  votes you lose. You don't really believe that this is a trend, do you? LOL
@SenMikeLee GOP, Obstructionism, Sabotaging USA for 6 years. Friends close, Enemy’s closer, Remember?
@SenMikeLee Mitch McConnell Admits The Koch Brothers Running GOP at Donor Summit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNOaGBec5Q0 …

@SenMikeLee @paulbenedict7 Sen Lee you are correct. The problem is  @SenatorReid in 2014.  @McConnellPress & @PRyan in 2015. BACKBONE!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Rein in Obama!
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler  Only idiots believe anything at Fox(faux) News !
.@SenMikeLee Tell Obama and Dems it's their turn to 'ride in the back.'. Keep up the good fight, Senator.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I hope you guy's get some help from those just elected Republican Senators!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Exactly! #WeThePeople have spoken & do not want amnesty.We are trusting Republicans to stop Obama's abuse of power.
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler    Don't Fear 2016...You Are Supported For Protecting The Constitution Even If It Means Impeachment
@SenMikeLee He's going to do EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER (Take a at Word)..So, CONGRESS HAD BETTER USE ALL OF IT'S POWER TO FIGHT! Don'tbackdown
@SenMikeLee @NeedA2ndJob Really, and what are they gonna do with 11M of people?
@SenMikeLee I pray to GOD Republicans can stop this lawlessness or We the People will have to take matters into our own hands! #tcot
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Build the fence
@SenMikeLee @Miller51550 Where was the power of the purse when W was president?
@SenMikeLee @conservbtfly Big AL says correct if we took action on his deliberate refusal to enforce immigration law,,he might b in order
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Not only the _right_ thing to do, also _great_ political strategy. GOP must_lead_! America wants this mess _fixed_!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #amnesty keep them all out!
@SenMikeLee do something on #Jobs #Taxes #CorporateTaxes first!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz How about deporting Illegals instead of resettling them in all 50 States?
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz REPUBLICANLIEONEWORD REPUBLICANLIEONEWORD.
@SenMikeLee @edwrather Good luck, McConnell already sounds like he's ready to surrender
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Ya! That worked the last time you tried that back in Oct'13. Very popular increasing national debt by $24B. Go 4 it!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz last time you all did the purse string thing it resulted in Gov shutdown. Very ineffective. Highly unpopular. failed
@SenMikeLee @lindamills62 Everyone wants immigration reform except for the racist right wing Rs. Get Speaker Orange to vote on Senate bill
@SenMikeLee @BettinaVLA With Boehner and McConnell there nothing will change. Obozo will do whatever he wants they won't fight him

@SenMikeLee Your Tweet Takes Center Stage On http://rbl.ms/1xtI1B3 
@SenMikeLee #Executive Amnesty is not amnesty. Congressional amnesty would be amnesty. Executive Amnesty seems to be an oxymoron.
@SenMikeLee @jmurd911 they need to pull all money away from him. No golf, vacations, FLOTUS 1 assistant, and keep her at home. No party's
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #youlie So extortion & holding the American people hostage is all you got? #gop #dnc #Potus
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Exactly, Boehner telling O that there won't be a gov shutdown or default on the debt is giving the purse to O
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Perhaps you should learn the definition of amnesty:
http://i.word.com/idictionary/amnesty …
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Please explain this "amnesty." I know it riles your ignorant racist base, but no one is proposing amnesty.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz That is an understatement if I ever heard one. Start with AF-1 fuel & Maintenance budget.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz The first thing you should do is get a better majority leader..SAY NO TO McCONNELL
@SenMikeLee Please rally the base to shut BO down through the power of the purse.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz take your jesus and stick it in your canadian ear you fruit loop bird face.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz This will be disastrous if this is mandated. It needs to be STOPPED! #NoAmnesty #tcot
@SenMikeLee  more abuse of power! when r u guys gonna impeach this moron
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Republicans need to do their job. Vote up or down on bills! Stop blocking & obstructing.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz The House needs to pass the bipartisan Senate immigration bill.  Boehner, get off your ass. #TeaPartyfail
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz You guys need to pass a budget. We haven't seen one of those for a while.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz What ever it takes, #Amnesty is not acceptable.
Thank you Sen! “@SenMikeLee: Rep. need to be prepared to exercise power of the purse to prevent #ExecutiveAmnesty: http://youtu.be/uV1aNRK_7Hw ”
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Calculating risk of impeachment efforts is other key if President O runs with overreach of power.
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz PLEASE stop Obama.  This is one of the top 3 issues I voted GOP for. #tcot #NoAmnesty
@SenMikeLee @NCconserv what 'purse' your purse has been snatched by a 'purse snatcher'
@SenMikeLee exactly.  You need to explain that concept to those who haven't a clue what congress can do! Go get 'em.  We need help! Ty
@SenMikeLee I wouldn't grant amnesty to a person who snuck across the boundaries of my property and say go ahead stay
.@SenMikeLee I'm sure your rhetoric is envied by colleagues that have to get votes from constituencies that aren't just white men.
@SenMikeLee really the only thing that will get obama's attention , spending.
@SenMikeLee @electricbassic I feel that they should have been doing it all along.#ExecutiveAmnesty  #tcot
@SenMikeLee millions of us have your back, just make "them" do the right thing Ppl sucking off system know it wouldn't last forever No fear!
@SenMikeLee Remind the other Senator's that they were not sent to compromise.  They were sent to stop Obama and his lawlessness.
@nuclant @SenMikeLee your a idiot
@hiqek6 @SenMikeLee Thank you.
@SenMikeLee In this case ....you mean the power of Shoulder bag......
@SenMikeLee How about a fallow the law funding act? I understand that is the law! Seems your opposition colleagues and the press forgot!
@SenMikeLee we need you to not let mitch mcconnell screw us by giving away the power of the purse.
@SenMikeLee Senator, it's CRITICAL that they do so! Republicans CAN stop Obama's lawlessness, IF they're willing to do so.
They MUST.
@ROCKInTheUSSA @SenMikeLee Obama needs to b impeached!!!
@SenMikeLee thats why we sent the republican to washington to stop obama
@kissangel864 @SenMikeLee if the republicans do nothing in 2 years other then fight obama be ready for 8 years of Hillary
@SenMikeLee Exactly, Obama can have temper tantrums  & then the dems will have to answer for it in the 2016 election..stay calm & be wise!
@JaeMcSprinkles @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz all DEMS r throwing tantrums right now. #keepcalm
