@RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI The majority of the American people don't want it repealed. Only you politicians do.
you are mistaken. Repeal it all and let the free market do its job.
The free market was doing a job alright. Denying coverage to me and to my son's chronic asthma. Polls show majority want to keep ACA.
who's fault is that? Mine? Other Americans? No. So don't ask we pay
just don't ask other insured people to pick up the tab
That's the whole point. This should be a single pay solution.
then don't call it insurance. Words have meaning. But just the same, when did my bills become your responsibility?
since ACA was enacted, healthcare costs have come down. And, they are rising at a slower rate than before. ER's expensive
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump income tax penalizes working Americans for being productive.
consumption tax is fair. Makes everyone a taxpayer. Repeal income tax
fight to make that happen please
Sooo Sessions lied like Flynn, and your defense is he "said" he would recuse himself if necessary? Boy
how did you become a politician with that argument
@WendyDamron @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI yuppers
The US Citizens want Obamacare gone! Finished! Removed. It has taken time but we now know what it is!
agreed! @senrobportman @SenSherrodBrown
MIKE It's your turn pal..step up and make this happen. DO NOT wait any longer! #MAGA
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI Our #ACA insurance needs far outweigh typical party lines. All incumbents should fear our vote. #utpol
If you can repeal with 51 you should, but also replace, don't leave people in the lurch.
WORK with them and get something done, stop fighting over bills!
Can they do that with 51 votes not 60?  I thought that was the issue?
2 yrs ago they KNEW Obama would never sign it so it was simply theatre for @SpeakerRyan
@FBI arrest these men. They knew about Sessions.
How come we never hear a plan to lower health care cost. We just have plans on how to buy insurance.
:  Yes, please get it done. No more excuses.  If McConnell won't push for this, he should be replaced as Majority Ldr
Keep fighting the good fight and stand strong for our new President!!  #MAGA
We want same healthcare Congress & families get & for the same price they pay
@ginareyna @SenTedCruz @SenRandPauI NOW
need to weed out the rinos.
noon stop obstruction.  Political ideology before country I see.
Let's see a plan and how it compares to Obamacare.
Thank you for stdg strong on #FullRepeal!! You are the True Conservatives in Congress. God bless you!
Sir, all of you had 8 years to work on this. It is hurting our small business. Why isn't it done?
what's the replacement? You are idiots - already voted on 60 times.
#Spreadinglikewildfire
Thanks for standing up to RINO's who want to undercut President Trump. This needs to be a full replace
Do it!!
#dontfukthisup
GOP Congress passed a the bill that Obama vetoed. Trump would sign it. Why all the delay?
no.
nope
Please have a replacement prepared and ready before a full repeal. Doing anything else is irresponsible
WE DON"T WANT IT REPEALED, and what excuse is there that GOP has had all this time and no replace plan
actions have consequences. I'll haunt you for eternity
So what's your plan for replacement? Don't ask the public to agree until you have an alternative.
just to make it crystal clear. If you succeed in a #FullRepeal how are you going to make sure I don't die?
oh wait. That's YOUR day and age.
it's your job to resolve issues not just dump them. In my day and age, we fixed things that are broken, not throw them out.
