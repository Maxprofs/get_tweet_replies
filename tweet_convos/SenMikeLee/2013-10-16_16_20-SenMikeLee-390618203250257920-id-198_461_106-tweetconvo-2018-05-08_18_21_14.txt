@SenMikeLee @rmack2x We need a provision mandating that all proposals etc. MUST BE READ, allowing appropriate time.  This is insane
.@epiphany504 .@rmack2x .@SenMikeLee Plus a permanent provision that each bill must pass Constitutional muster are its dead in the water.
@PhillipLaird @epiphany504 @SenMikeLee I like the "applies equally to all legislators and Pres & Vp, and Supreme Court..."
@SenMikeLee You made it that way, chump. While you're licking your wounds, think about the millions of families who went w/out. #resign
Then try a different strategy next time. "@SenMikeLee Here we are again: A proposal that maintains status quo, very little time to read..."
@jermsguy @SenMikeLee Exactly.  Thing is Senator Lee doesn't care about strategy or actually changing policy, only in grandstanding.
@idesignwis @jermsguy @SenMikeLee False. We could've used the last two weeks to highlight botched Obamacare rollout, but Lee shutdown govt.
@idesignwis @jermsguy @SenMikeLee U realize that this shutdown cost $34b right? How is that fiscal conservatism?
@SenMikeLee @USAB4L up against 17.10 DEADLINE unless special law invoked re paying interest 1st(GOP not have votes)fund>mid-JAN!FIGHT AGAIN!
@SenMikeLee So very sad.  But at least Mitchy is happy, until he is finally out of office that is.  Just tragic.
@SenMikeLee @rjames1928 yea and fall in line or lose your campaign money from GOP #corrupt
@SenMikeLee @wribb Status Quo? We did worse with the debt ceiling deal.
@SenMikeLee @_labbe Don't worry sir! There's $2B in there for Mitch so vote for it and shut up!! <snark off>
@_labbe @SenMikeLee I sooo wish T.E.A Party would leave GOP en masse! To Your ears dear Lord, to Your ears...
@SenMikeLee The biggest mistake the Founders made was not requiring an 80% vote in Congress to pass anything! And only 50% to repeal laws.
@SenMikeLee thank you for not giving up, thank you for showing the other senators what leadership looks like through courageous action
@SenMikeLee @korrifoster Filibuster the damned thing. We got your back. PLEASE
@SenMikeLee Senator, we got it. We, the American People, are screwed.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net  Our fighting the debt ceiling cost $700B. Great work slowing recovery! Who cares if it hurts US, blame Obama!
@SenMikeLee Now that government is open, the Obamas can plan their multi-million dollar Thanksgiving and Christmas vacations!
@SenMikeLee love the $174000 check to 5th richest Sen Launtenbergs wife -- she must really be choking I mean struggling on all that money
love the $174000 check to 5th richest Sen Launtenbergs wife -- she must really be choking I mean struggling on all that money @cspanwj
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU for fighting for US!  The tide WILL turn.. just wait and see!
@baumsche @SenMikeLee This was but one battle. This war is on, We need to keep our heads. 2 days of venting then we start thinking again.
@SenMikeLee @wribb oh wait this is also how they ran obamacare through as well!  No more end earmarking of our future to the #gopjudas
@SenMikeLee JUST SAY NO!
@SenMikeLee you will be one of the chosen few who will survive future elections if you stay on this path.  We the People are fed up w/ DC!
@SenMikeLee @happykarigirl #notanotherdime2GOP
@SenMikeLee PLEASE make it a mission for someone to expose the $ to rich Widows, $ for Dams etc. PPl Don't know these things @ttsocb5
@SenMikeLee as  a leader of a losing team I would keep my mouth shut and hide for awhile. I read the bill why can't u. U had your chance
@SenMikeLee @msbs05 WaPo commies want DirtyFilthyPeeps living lke Palestinians in darkness thanks 4 shining light on them and their agenda
@SenMikeLee NO TIME BECAUSE DEFAULT IS SECONDS AWAY. That one's your fault.  Try taking "personal responsibility" for it you Hypocrite.
@SenMikeLee @monkeydogman @GOP senators up 4 reelection voted yes. They GONE!
@SenMikeLee @monkeydogman Basically more loss of freedom shoved down throats of the PPL. TY 4 staying true. We got yor back.
@SenMikeLee @wribb RINOs claim that GOP strategy was flawed but offered no alternative. GOP has 3 months to come up w/better one. Start now!
@SenMikeLee @jessalanfields Stop the cry baby tyrant!
@SenMikeLee We stand with y'all.
@SenMikeLee And gives a $3 billion bribe to Mitch!
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Good fight Sen Lee  Keep it up!
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net No need to read the bills...status quo=US taxpaying citizens get screwed again!
@SenMikeLee thank u and Ted Cruz for trying.
@SenMikeLee I want you to know that we conservatives are glad you are there.  You are what American needs and wants.  Hang in there.
@SenMikeLee sand yet it will save the country continued pain and uncertainty! Both a good thing
@SenMikeLee Keep reminding people that ACA is a Dem nightmare. We thank you for all you do. Ignore Sen. McCain.
@SenMikeLee keep fighting the good fight, sir! :-)
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Hey. Obama promised to post bills online for us to read. Oh yeah. Another lie.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for standing tall for the Republic.
@SenMikeLee nancy's way of running r govt
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net no time to read the bill? Everyone should vote NO then! "FREE THE People" @ThePeoplesCube
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Same ole same ole.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net what else should we expect our president is a lying ass clown
Don't understand how house is permitted passing if can't evaluate or read bill! WTH? This is irresponsible.@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Thank you for fighting for EVERYONE
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Congress has failed in its responsibility to represent and to be the keeper of the purse. This treason
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net You and @SenTedCruz need to start a Constitution Party!!!! I won't be voting for another Republican.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net  The bill gives 174G to the widow of a late representative.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net 2014, time to retake the senate and also primary out McConnell and the other Rino's.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net I like the way you stood up. You and #TedCruz are our HEROES.
@SenMikeLee @edonn84  So Sad...The GOP always caves.... Disappointing
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net WE stand with you. THANK YOU for your vote. Pork. We don't want it.
@SenMikeLee  this tactic used time and time again. Time for some rule changes to the way Congress conducts OUR business
@SenMikeLee God Bless! On to the next fight. You haven't won in DC but you're winning Americans!! #MakeDCListen #shutdown @Senate_GOPs
@SenMikeLee @sparkles3020 in the meantime...another circus performing in January. Same actors, same acts, same show.
@SenMikeLee America just died
@SenMikeLee Keep on fighting for the American people...most of us out here beyond the beltway appreciate you and Senator Cruz
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry way to hang in there and fight Mike, you're a true, great American who cares about our Constitutional Republic
@ScottMDixon22 @senmikelee Indeed you are a great patriot Senator as is @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee Thank you for fighting with US against the ESTABLISHMENT @gop We'll help do some housecleaning in 2014 @tedcruz #makedclisten
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry Porkalicious!!! Haute slop cusine for hungry politicians!
@SenMikeLee I can tell you Americans are fed up, they have reached their breaking point. Thank you for standing on principle.
@SenMikeLee @RileyRebel129 Thank You and Senator Cruz for trying. Fighting the establishment clowns will always take guts.
@SenMikeLee @DayKadence You have to pass the build to find out what's in the bill. #StopTheInsanity
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry - with $2 billion thrown in for Mc Connell's Kentucky Kickback!
@SenMikeLee fight like hell and don't back down, the truth about Obamascare will break the USA #RT
@SenMikeLee Isn't there a time frame for introducing a bill before a vote is called? If do, why not enforce it?
@SenMikeLee Not your fault sir..You did your best. GOD BLESS.
@SenMikeLee then vote NO!
@SenMikeLee DO NOT ACCEPT IT if you don't have time to read it! Jeez even a 10 yr old knows that
@SenMikeLee As long as govt members are "leaders" of parties and not servants to the People they'll do as they please with our money
@SenMikeLee @fitzfam2000   God Bless U Sir....No Money No Votes 4 ReProgs
@SenMikeLee we the American people deserve so much better!
@SenMikeLee @climber25 :FIGHT LIKE HELL AND NEVER EVER BACK DOWN! #PRINCIPLES!!!!
@SenMikeLee @Jude505 Status quo is not what Americans want.  Status quo is a downward spiral!
@SenMikeLee and full of pork
@SenMikeLee stand your ground
@SenMikeLee its time for term limits lets get the entrenched politicans out of DC
@SenMikeLee @WAMK enemies from within.
@SenMikeLee Now law should be over 4 pages as that is all it took for the constitution
@SenMikeLee I am looking forward to you getting bounced at the nomination convention just like Bob Bennett.
@SenMikeLee quit being so nice and maybe you'll get everyone's attention.
@SenMikeLee filibuster
@SenMikeLee Don't allow it...no more! Done..Americans are extremely pissed off at all of you! DO YOUR JOB! No exemptions! No to higher debt!
@SenMikeLee Welcome to "Hope & Change", We hoped things would change, but it didn't. You need a new vehicle to express your political will
@SenMikeLee the elected elites need the status quo to keep their exalted seats of power. To be responsible is NOT their nature.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for trying.  It might help if the GOP didn't eat its young and stopped trying to be Dem lite.  Same to @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee When you have finished reading the spam you probably won't want the American people to know what it says.
@SenMikeLee pretty sure the clean CR 20 days ago didn't have any surprises.
@SenMikeLee thank you for the fight with your blinders off and looking out for your fellow Americans
@SenMikeLee  Please keep trying to #MakeDCListen  and Thank You
@SenMikeLee #dontcave Stand strong
@SenMikeLee Thank you for doing what you did. @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee governing by chaos it's the Chicago way.
@SenMikeLee You lost once again, get over it! Can't wait to dedicate my time, money, & efforts so you don't get reelected in 3 years!
@SenMikeLee How will you vote?
@SenMikeLee maybe try something different next time.
@SenMikeLee then vote no on everything until it all dies
@SenMikeLee Need a unfavorite option on this tweet.
@SenMikeLee this is a bunch of bs !! Who in the hell do these people think they are ? Gods?
@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 Then you should make time to explain it to the people, before it is signed.
@SenMikeLee beat them at their game, it's now or never!
@SenMikeLee perhaps u should of thought about that b4 u&Cruz put us in this position #idiot
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up 4 the ppl &  #makedclisten. If @GOP were smart they would realize Obama doesn't do Good OLD Boy poltc
@SenMikeLee Agreed.
@SenMikeLee God Bless you Senator and Thank You for standing up for the American people
@JosephMRyan1 @SenMikeLee in '14 we'll elect more true conservatives to help you in your fight for America - and remove the big gov elites.
@SenMikeLee  Congress's all-talk-no-action is reminiscent of the Dodo in Alice in Wonderland, "everybody has won and all must have prizes"
@SenMikeLee Please put fight for a rule that says you have to read understand and have time to debate something before you vote on it
@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 just pull it pants down and bend over now you know how we feel
@SenMikeLee Let me break it down for you. Sen. Mitch McConnell and the state of Kentucky 1 - Sen. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz 0
@SenMikeLee - Voting NO I hope?
@SenMikeLee if it maintains the status quo, it has already been analyzed and explained to Americans #logicfail
@SenMikeLee So much for #Capitalism Fed Govt continuing to prop up Big City Real Estate bubbles at the expense of taxpayers #shutdown #Fox
@SenMikeLee I support you sir, but I'm all for #DefundTheGOP because your colleagues are the surrender caucus.
@SenMikeLee When can we have CLEAN bills? No wonder we are BROKE!!! #
@SenMikeLee Time to get new leadership for the GOP in Congress! Are you listening @RepGusBilirakis, @marcorubio ?
@SenMikeLee Turn your efforts to something productive.
@SenMikeLee Praying for you, I really wish you would not vote until you read the bill .... Thank you for standing for us
@SenMikeLee Tea Party extremism isn't going to work. Everyone knows debt must be addressed but you're not going to bully people.
@SenMikeLee 
Thank you for fighting for the American People! You have my continued support!
#Patriot
@SenMikeLee Well, you're either part of the problem, or part of the solution, Senator! Start calling a spade a spade! For Once!
@SenMikeLee Sen McConnell got a $2,000,000,000 kickback for caving to Obama. http://tiny.cc/uyl24w 
@SenMikeLee Fight without blinders on next time.
.@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 vote No
@SenMikeLee  why are kicking the can Mike? What will it take?
@SenMikeLee Then publish a list of all pork and which pig it benefits.
@SenMikeLee We got your back.
Tough when it's not Green Eggs & Ham. RT:@SenMikeLee A proposal that maintains status quo, very little time to read & evaluate the bill...
@Scrivener3 @senmikelee and money for Kentucky . Disgusting. Why are we in debt? There are so many thing we can cut.
@SenMikeLee I would encourage Reps to WALK OUT & REUSE TO VOTE IF they try to do this to us again.  Do you think that would get attention?
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU You are a HERO and are truly trying to help the American people, your sincerity comes through
@SenMikeLee Time to get rid of the career politicians. Since they forget who they work for they need voted out!
@dblozik @VerumEstLiberta @SenMikeLee  The USA's True party is BORN -- perhaps called #AmericaRealParty or TeaPublican
@Palinspired @Swthghheel @dblozik @VerumEstLiberta @SenMikeLee LIBERTY PARTY - freeing the people from the oppressive grip of government!!
@orangepoppins @Palinspired @Swthghheel @dblozik @SenMikeLee I will stand with the Liberty Party
@SenMikeLee pls keep fighting the good fight. We stand behind you. God bless.
@SenMikeLee I'm hearing there're  provisions in there that let the POTUS raise debt limits unilaterally! Is this True!?
@SenMikeLee Please, just stop. You're making the sane limited government people look bad. REALLY bad.
@elforesto @SenMikeLee Let's not dumb, he's just being responsive (pandering) to the nutjobs that elected him. Time to take our party back.
@SenMikeLee Fits the definition of insanity.
@SenMikeLee no time to read then all votes should be No!!!!!
.@SenMikeLee I mean...I'm pretty sure we all agree that shutting down the government was a terrible thing and we want it over.
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator Lee I stand with you Sen Paul and Sen Cruz
@SenMikeLee and yet all the republicans will sign it.
@SenMikeLee I feel lost today! Like there is no hope at all. There is no leadership in my party!!!!
@SenMikeLee  Aren't you proud of yourselves, our Arizona Senators @SenJohnMcCain @jefflake , thanks for spending MORE MONEY! @juliekatsel
@SenMikeLee Don't say proposals and bills anymore. They're all just deals for the political criminal element holding us hostage.
@SenMikeLee holy crap, the avg. working American is doomed under Obama!
@SenMikeLee AND Reid&BO emboldened and for sure will not negotiate in future.Caving Rinos may be worse than ACA for Americans.McCainsplan?
@SenMikeLee @R_Will_34 win or lose doesn't matter if you keep fighting! #NeverGiveUp
