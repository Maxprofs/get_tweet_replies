@Wrench06 @bzaz @SenMikeLee @SenJohnMcCain @GrahamBlog Will McCain or Graham ever admit that Mike & Ted were right?
@RCamsore @bzaz @Wrench06 @SenMikeLee @SenJohnMcCain @GrahamBlog 
No, because Progressives never concede to truth. It ruins their reality.
@GH719 @bzaz @Wrench06 @SenMikeLee @SenJohnMcCain @GrahamBlog You got a point there!
@SenMikeLee @RealRepublican Indeed! It's pure SHAM--as unadulterated as sham can possibly be!

@SenMikeLee...Obamacare in one word:  Scam
@SenMikeLee  #SenatorMikeLeeInOneWord  : History,  #p2 #tcot
@SenMikeLee Its the law. Rather than kicking and holding your breath why not try to improve it. Its a GOP plan after all.
@pmeahan888 GUN rights are the law. Why don't you libs accept that ? @SenMikeLee
@GloriaMitchell6 @SenMikeLee Right. It's settled law. Same as the ACA. What can I say? It's Majority rule. Votes matter. Sometimes u win etc
“@SenMikeLee: #ObamacareInOneWord ShamWow ... without the wow.” Genius!
“@SenMikeLee: #ObamacareInOneWord ShamWow ... without the wow.” Did you stay up all night thinking of that?

@SenMikeLee Have to ask. With a 3 yr dev period for ObamaCare, what can we expect with immigration? 11 million go to http://undocumented.gov ?
@SenMikeLee O'BarryDontCare #ObamacareInOneWord
@SenMikeLee Stand strong Senator!  We in the TP worked hard to get you there
@TalkerMark @SenMikeLee He did  work hard but until the Majority is the Tea Party. not much will change. You win some and lose some.
@SenMikeLee Makes sense to us. Sham President, Sham product.
