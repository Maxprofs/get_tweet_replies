@SenTedCruz @DailyPamphlet Really? Because we thought you were a huge fan!!  You are on wrong side of history
.@jbased @SenTedCruz  Obamacare can't be implemented. Very poorly thought out. It will euthanize itself.
@DailyPamphlet @SenTedCruz Like in MA?  Right wing fought Medicare too. You were wrong then - and now
.@jbased @SenTedCruz Medicare is a mess and nearly insolvent. Lots of DRs won't even take Medicare patients.
@DailyPamphlet @SenTedCruz Do you and Sen. Cruz think Medicare should be eliminated?  Thought not.
.@jbased @SenTedCruz It's not sustainable. It will eliminate itself eventually. In case you haven't noticed the country is imploding
@DailyPamphlet @SenTedCruz You didn't answer the question. Do you want to eliminate Medicare?
.@jbased @SenTedCruz Why not?  It's just insurance. If you want insurance go buy some. Government can't run anything efficiently.
@SenTedCruz @STSTWO Thank you, Senator!
@SenTedCruz @Bellanieve Keep fighting Senator
@SenTedCruz I almost rue the effort I put into your grassroots campaign. Wasn't thinking about the Shark Tank I was sending you to. Sorry.
@SenTedCruz @BlackIrishI  Amen brother!
@SenTedCruz @Marsha250 We've heard hat before. Cruz is NOT recommended for 2016. Another Trojan Horse terrorist.
@coastx @SenTedCruz Keep an eye on him.
@Marsha250 @SenTedCruz Right...
@SenTedCruz defund away!!
@mozartcat @SenTedCruz Look at what Obamacare is doing to this state http://healthcareforall.com/2013/07/obamacare-is-working-in-maryland/ …
@SenTedCruz @southyrivver Outstanding job Ted!
Good! @SenTedCruz Because #Obamacare was never the least bit about #healthcare. It is a power grab. A trojan horse. #Hewitt #Levin #Liberty
@Libertyworld Interesting. How so? I wouldn't be happy with any public healthcare reform that didn't remove insurance companies' influence.
Fine,@markgr101, but that doesn't win the case for #Obamacare, esp. when one faces the devastating % of docs who intend to quit over of it.
@Libertyworld not trying to win any case, idk enough about the current reforms to have an informed opinion,was why I asked how is it trojan?
@markgr101 It is a Trojan Horse b/c it could hardly be better designed to ruin what it presumes to save, paving the way for central control.
@sentedcruz @maramasu Thank you Senator!
@SenTedCruz @Sagesavant  SIT BACK TED LET US SHOW YOU HOW ITS DONE WE THE PEOPLE WILL DEFUND OCOMMIE CARE WE WILL NOT COMPLY
