@SenMikeLee @winojanet Only affected when you and your GOP jerks caused the shutdown. ACA is the law, get over it & move on. Stop lying.
@acey49 @SenMikeLee @winojanet You can't be this uninformed. The Obama WH has been lying to YOU since day 1.
@SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee @glockster23 those poor people will still vote democrat because they didn't learn this public schools
@SenMikeLee @cbinflux Mostly I am tweeting a lot more to help my blood pressure. Thank you!
@EricKjos @SenMikeLee Pressure cooker principle...
.@SenMikeLee @Toupsfamily  Jay Carney needs to see this. When asked the other day, he said there's no evidence to suggest it's true.
@Hail_Paul_Here @SenMikeLee he is Obama's patsy
@Toupsfamily @SenMikeLee Who isn't that speaks on his behalf. Up to & including MSM. Like a giant circus w/more performers than audience.
@SenMikeLee my family is now going to pay $8,000 more per year. Instead of saving it, paying debt, clothes, food, retail. Has to hurt GDP!
@SenMikeLee what's the economic growth impact on health care INCREASES at a rate about $5,000 per citizen? Neg or Pos for the Country.
@SenMikeLee The problem is that there are to many lies floating about.
@SenMikeLee @cincinchili Thank you for representing the people and not the GOP establishment or yourself. God bless you, Mike!!
@SenMikeLee Actually, municipal & county employees seem 2b wallopped by #Obamacare.  Huge # of cuts & hr reduxns.
@SenMikeLee @glidermedic My doctor is no longer accepying insurance of any kind--only cash, check, credit cards.
@SenMikeLee @PolitiBunny
@SenMikeLee GOP needs to gather those thousands of people who have gotten HC Cancellation notices due to ACA, to upstage POTUS' staged event
@Madison_con @SenMikeLee Problem is Lee doesn't have tax $ to fly ppl hither and yon, like 0b0z0 has.
@LuanaMacLac @SenMikeLee would be quite relevant if Lee used the obamacare subsidy he gets but doesnt want, to fund it.
@SenMikeLee my company elim employer life ins, deductible subsidy and our rates went up 25%
Many new part time vs full time hires
@SenMikeLee not being affected yet. Dont have HC and dont plan on getting it.
@SenMikeLee Thanks, Barack Heussein Obamacare!
@SenMikeLee @LibertySurfer Obama didnt address the disaster for us that had ins we liked now cant afford to pay for or use!
@SenMikeLee O'care=29 hr work wks 4 Americans~$Millions 4 Canadian firm 2 NOT created website~Now, O'care Call Center in India?
@SenMikeLee you should have tweeted this @BarackObama maybe if enough people tweeted to him his assistant would mention it to him.
@SenMikeLee @PolitiBunny My insurance has now doubled. I'm not a happy camper. :(
@SenMikeLee @PolitiBunny If I keep my plan and same Doctor.
@SenMikeLee Wonder how many "public' employees getting hrs cut voted 4 #Obama? Probably complaining w/no idea #Obama did it to them. #Sheep
@SenMikeLee @RushetteNY New Obamacare Ad Deceptive: "Site was Very Easy To Use"..Until it Wasn't http://weaselzippers.us/2013/10/21/new-obamacare-ad-deceptive-the-site-was-very-easy-to-use-until-it-wasnt/ … …
@SenMikeLee Older couple, one retired, one employed. High premium cost, deductibles, higher taxes means less $ for retirement savings.
@SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot   TY and @SenTedCruz for trying to stop this abomination #DefundObamacare #DefundTheGOP
Obamanomics: Here is a list of Employers cutting jobs and hours as a result of #Obamacare - http://ow.ly/q1DVi  via @SenMikeLee
@SaysMissy @SenMikeLee and that is just govt or almost govt jobs.  Private sector is decimated by it, more for welfare! #ObamaHikes
@SenMikeLee My sister Grocery emp of 25yrs got her ft hrs cut to parttime 2 mths ago and still in effect. I have been helping with groceries
@SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot Mike, Obama Care gets my blood pressure up!  So, I guess I'd say, Obama Care KILLS.
“@SenMikeLee: Did you see this list of employers that are cutting jobs? #Obamacare? http://ow.ly/q1DVi  How are you being affected?”
@SenMikeLee @jpguillory_ /I have seen many loose their jobs and insurance already over obamacrap , even one of my daughters, he's an insult.
@vfroe @SenMikeLee I couldn't agree more Virgil. And what's really sad is that he was re-elected. It's pathetic!
RT @SenMikeLee: Did you see this list of employers that are cutting jobs and hours because of #Obamacare?
@aubreyvaughan @SenMikeLee 
tell them to stop lying to their employees
@SenMikeLee @archers6 Alas; the unintended consequences of the policies of an incompetent President and his crew of thugs.
@SenMikeLee My M.D. husband got his hosp. based salary cut 50% due to OCare.  forced into retirement. not worth working 4 zero
@SenMikeLee @Rmueting Our BCBS rates went from $700/mo to $1300/mo. for our family of four. This is not affordable.
@SuzanneSF @SenMikeLee OMG that is just BULL its a almost 700 Bucks a month TAX yea TAX isn't that what the court said it was
@Rmueting I know, right? In what reality is that affordable?@SenMikeLee
@SuzanneSF @SenMikeLee god mam dont know how your going to do it
@SenMikeLee Notice it is mostly govt public jobs. Prob gop govs.hurting ppl to make this point. Sound familiar.#GOPshutdown
@SenMikeLee Fulltime jobs are a thing of the past thanks to #obamacare @whitehouse #teaparty elect a conservative next time.
@SenMikeLee I had my girls insured until ObamaCare. United Hlth dropped them 'cause NO more KIDS ONLY POLICIES. Offr me Family plan @ <1K/mo
@SenMikeLee The majority is public schools. So gop gov are trying to help gop msg. Rotten politics. Thx I am going to use this to show govs.
@SenMikeLee @ConnieHair Yes, Mike, we saw it a long time ago, while you were busy in the effort to crater the poll numbers of Republicans.
@SenMikeLee current plan terminated. New ACA plan is 152% higher, increase of $10,000 per year
My meds, copay and deductible exorbitant. Roll out the victims not the glitches. Organize quite a crowd 4 Nation to C @SenMikeLee @tahDeetz
@lilium479 but you're just anecdotal, or something. @SenMikeLee
If you did your homework I am the norm not the excpetion. @tahDeetz @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee 
Maybe, we have some good Ol' Patriot Hackers screwing up Obama's care website.. Of course or Gov would never admit to it.
@SenMikeLee I'm seeing my freedoms disapear'n, what's the next thing Obama will make us buy or be taxed,...tracking implants ?
@SenMikeLee Monthly rate went up, coverage went down. All deductibles and out of pocket costs went up 50-100%.
@USAB4L @Psysamurai33317 @SenMikeLee Sounds affordable to me.
@AnnMaran @Psysamurai33317 @SenMikeLee It's the #UnaffordableCareAct.
@SenMikeLee I work in a clinical lab now that insurance covers screenings @ no cost our business is growing and people are healthier
@SenMikeLee in 2004 I worked part time at Wendy's my hours were cut 3 times in 6 weeks until I worked less then 15hours a week. Before ACA
@SenMikeLee - you have to wonder WHY this isn't front page news? #ACA is such a success story from every angle. #trainwreck.
@SenMikeLee Do not give up! Follow the Constitution and do not become Democratic-Light like the old guard Republicans.
@SenMikeLee I notice that its only part time employees who are having their hours cut.
@SenMikeLee 8% increase, premium now over $2,200.00 a month.
RT “@SenMikeLee: Did you see this list of employers that are cutting jobs and hours because of #Obamacare? http://ow.ly/q1DVi 
@SenMikeLee That's how biz reacts to bad policy Something Libs know nothing about
@SenMikeLee GOP needs to deliver this as a headline for Press Conference.  "Lost coverage?  Vote Tea Party"
@SenMikeLee FL is acting like a spoiled child and so its screwing us big time on #Obamacare.  Screwed by FL legislature and #RickScott
Hahaha! Most of these "employers" are governments & state schools, with politicians in charge who want ACA to fail.
Failure -> @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee So put together a shock ad compiled of these stories and air during primetime programming to tell ppl truth with DETAILS.
@SenMikeLee thank you for your service. Obamacare is cake compared to the shit we have endured.Are you a doctor or insurance salesmen?
@SenMikeLee If Obama gives a speech stating there is "No Proof" of job loss, how does he get away with openly lying to America ?
@SenMikeLee my buddy is freaking out. His healthcare and premiums are going up. His company warned him after increase last year & this year.
.@SenMikeLee
.@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Obama has my twitter accounts blocked when I tweet people. Twitter no longer free speech. It is controlled by progressive.
@SenMikeLee Im being forced off my wifes plan
@SenMikeLee Not to mention all the companies that are doing it & NOT openly calling the media to tell them
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz My Company is dropping a good plan. Used by those who need expensive care. Now they foot twice as much.
@SenMikeLee No problem, just put the minimum wage for part-time employees to $20/hr so people can afford the ACA health exchange insurance.
@SenMikeLee just had hair cut at Fantastic Sams in CA and her hours were cut to 31.
@SenMikeLee Premium will be half of my annual income if I chose to use ACA exchange and my family would be responsible for $12,700 O.O.P $$
