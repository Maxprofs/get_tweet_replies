Conservatives should follow and support the ideas of Cruz, Paul, and Lee regarding Repeal of ObamaNoCare.  POTUS must work w/ them.
He's a complete disgrace to this great nation. I would distance myself so as not to be taken down with him.
I like hope you tagged his personal Twitter rather than the POTUS one. Says a lot don't you think?
I'm sorry are you living on the same planet we are? Or is your definition on success avoiding impeachment?
Please bro what ever u smoking stop  @SenMikeLee
Congrats to the 115th GOP Congress for going down in history as willing to sacrifice every principle they ever had for Donald Trump. Sad!

@GOP please read & watch this before voting on healthcare: https://twitter.com/chare11/status/859385012612935683 â€¦
Can you say the same about the Republican Congress ???
no thanks to senate Shut the Government down..MORONS to put this bill together
Really? Nothing successful about this morally corrupt guy be ikng supported by Republicans.
Seriously!?! The last 100 days have been horrific, I felt like I've been living in the twilight zone. Gorsuch was the good, the rest was bad
The "bad" are the activist judges and Rino's who block his efforts to honor his promises.
Being a Republican does not mean you have to support a crazy president who is Republican. I choose principles over party.
If your so strong on defending the constitution, start with impeaching president 45!! I as an American feel unsafe with him in office!!!
You could always move to the middle east.
Shouldn't you be congratulating Russia if you really like this hot mess?
Make no mistake. #TrumpCare is an act of #Terrorism. #TrumpCare is an act of #HybridWar, designed to kill and confound. #TrumpRussia 
What movie have you been watching?
Sincere question, @SenMikeLee- are you on drugs?? 
worst spending plan ever.Obamas republicans strike again.We dont need our party.They give dems all they want..Need new party.kid yourselfs
I was going 2 troll but looks like everyone else did a good job.
He Allow CA Conversion Therapy Ban to stand forcing young people to suffer until they turn 18. I don't think he is what you believe he is.
You literally were able to name one thing in 100 days. That's embarrassing! I've been more productive than our president! SAD! And laughable
You've got some brown stuff on your nose Mike.
delusional.  unfollow
thanks Mike ,we need to get all the support that we can
really @SenMikeLee you're going to peddle his line of B.S. to? #WhereAreTheConservatives?
Are we declaring it a success because he's managed to remain president thus far?
Lol dude... Lol....
You are Delusional!
You lost my vote next time lee. Your supporting a liar 84121
Come
Although he didn't start any wars to get a Nobel Peace Prize  (LOL), he's had a great 100 days in spite of Congress. He Gorsuched the Dems!
Your statement is as delusional as many of Trump's.  Failed Muslim bans, ACA repeal, one lie after another.. NOT successful.
You are delusional @SenMikeLee and an utter embarrassment to Utah.
Mike I love what you're doing in general but if we're being honest, he's done next to nothing to advance conservatism.
@Evan_McMullin Please primary this guy. Total sheep. #iliveinutah
This is what success looks like? #thebarislow #embarrassing #goaway
And for in doing a lot of Obama's executive order messes
Is success defined by further polarizing the nation?
We who voted for Trump are frustrated with Congress for obstructing policies we were promised.  You have a Repub House and Senate! Fix it!
You must know it's not just liberals complaining about Trump, right?
It's not a success if the only accomplishment fits in one tweet.
Successful? Please, don't give credit to @POTUS, all "credit" goes to the nuclear method @GOP Senate had to enforce. No success here!!
The lower courts run this country at the moment. SC doesn't take up important cases anymore. Just ignored CO baker #religiousliberty
That's great and all, but Trump just nominated. No political capitol was even needed to get him confirmed after the rule change.
I would debate that, the 2 unelected co-presidents have subverted too many campaign promises ABOLISH DACA, no refugees, and MAGA
I hear that there is special at the eye doctor 2 for 1
Well now we all know where your loyalties lie. What a shameful representative.
Merrick Garland
 You are joking Sen. Lee, right? Tell me you're joking. I can't take another good man falling for Don the con. Not again.
You've got to be kidding!
Nope. 
What have you been smoking!?!?!?!
Hahaha...    Wtf?
Umm and failing on every legislative goal he promised. Not hard to get a Supreme Court justice when you have a majority and change the rules
@carolinagirl63 @realDonaldTrump
now #AuditCongress @GOP & @DNC #DrainTheSwamp  #MakeAmericagreatAgain 
your idea of success and mine are clearly at odds.
Lolololol
Successful? LOL. Sad!
jeepers.
so he appointed a stolen Justice under the nuclear option.. and that was a success? What? Who the F are you ppl
Democratic Party made  the rule now you live by it 
Wow, you must set the bar real, real, real low.
No.
Outside of Gorsuch, there have been no successes you can attribute to #45
With all do respect, I question the genuineness of a politician who refers to this as a successful  days. Unless successful means surviving
I hope the next 100  days will truly be successful.
@POTUS @SenTedCruz #JustDoIt ! #LetLeftSueGovt #ConservativeJudgeShop #UseLeftsTactics #EndSanctuaryCities #IndictMayors #BuildTheWall now!
Successful? Perhaps, if one only cares about filling a SCOTUS seat. And this was more a McConnell accomplishment.

Really? Successful? The biggest failure in recent history!!
Only a sycophant would call D-bag D's first #100Days "successful" Do you remember the last time you felt your spine sir? #TermLimits4Senate
successfully stealing a Supreme Court seat? I'm going to remember this....You look like a stand up guy but what y'all did to Judge Garland..
Agree, Senator. Been pleasantly surprised, will vote for Trump in '20. Suspect many suburban GOP leaning voters who sat home in '16 will too
Say it a few thousand more times.  I'm sure you'll convince someone eventually
Please stop being a sheep. I really want to vote for you next year. Country before party. Pull your head out. #100Days #Trumprussia
Lets get this border wall funded..
el chapo law builds the wall.
read up on ted cruz tweeter

When these accolades are made, is it too much to ask for examples cause I have no idea what has been successful thus far. Btw..I'm serious.
This is a joke right? Is this the new standard for "successful" - what about the "100 day contract" he signed for his voters? #TrumpRussia
Why didn't we see you at Judge Thapar's nomination hearing Wednesday? Another brilliant selection! Let's fill those 180 vacancies.
Contract broken. The swamp wins again.
He's a complete and total jackass! Keep your distance.
Love ya senator but honestly, it hasn't been that successful
