We in your district are watching you! You know the right thing to do...will you have the courage? I just saw you vote I.
Judge seems ok...Everyone else Trump picked very bad!
Arlington Cemetery is full of WW2 Vets who died fighting what we just installed in the WH and Supreme Court.
Pretty sure we elect Presidents 4 years at a time. Nobody thinks McConnell would've stopped confirmation with Repub pick.
I hope all Republicans support the nominees of President Trump.  I'm sickened when I hear McCain and Graham giving dems fuel.
@muzikgirl11 
Thanks Sen. Lee ! We do NOT want Gorsuch to be "borked" !
Stand up & FIGHT with your words for his confirmation !
Your hypocrisy is pathetic. #GarlandTreatment
@GLOingNews Perhaps the court will once again do it's job, and bring end to activism!
#NeilGorsuch
grovel grovel tongue up ass
@BeagleGuy13 Thank you! We need you right now in the Senate Mike!
Today in Utah. THOUSANDS. Grow a spine and denounce the insanity.
you say you're committed to constitutional leadership but then support Trump?!?! Hypocrite much??
do you remember when you wouldn't even TAKE a meeting with Garland?  What's up with that, Mike?
Your applause of this president will emphatically not serve you in elections to come. Or in the history books.
So in other words, you're a typical Orrin Hatch wannabe a******.
think about #PeopleOverParty. If you & @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP don't stop 45, you're all going down with him. Wake UP!
.@SenMikeLee As do we! Now let's confirm #Gorsuchbae
Filibuster 4 /8 years... not sorry
Our president Trump always knows how to choose a winner.
Too many descriptors. Lack of humanity. Sad!

Do you applaud Trump for insulting our Australian & Mexican allies, while he eases sanctions on our enemy Russia?U R a hypocrite
you support the dude who founded a fascism club?
Rubio is saying, DEMS have been ordered to oppose EVERYTHING he tries, no matter what, just keep opposing.
why wouldn't you enthusiastically work for Garland? Only distinction is that one supports the labor and women's movements.
If Gorsuch were a principled Constitutionalist, he'd have refused nomination and demanded that Merrick Garland be seated.
once again! Listen to a majority of your constituents and be their voice! Stop voting contrary to YOUR people who do not agree!
READ BANNON BACKGROUND, CLEARLY WHITE SUPREMACIST
@WilkowMajority #Sad
eventually the parties need to show some unification. Or we're going to have 4 to 8 year ping-pong of parties.
Can't wait for 2018! Oh don't forget about #MerrickGarland  and also #resist #StopPresidentBannon
have to started to work on Soros and the NGO's?
By supporting him you Republican party line, anti women & corp legislation, and anti campaign funding changes.
Not only that: Republicans have approved two SCOTUS nominees for Obama. Why do democrats forget that? Was that 100 years ago?
and you should apologize to President Trump!
When will you tell us your thoughts on the Muslim ban? Have you heard of it?
Ihavemany questionsabouthisbelief's. PresidentTrumpismyPresident,butIneedmyquestionsansweredbeforeIcanagreeforhimtobe approved!
do not be afraid of nuke option. Utah has your back
Excellent choice? Don't make me laugh.
this is not okay. This will reverse women's reproductive rights. Why does the GOP hate women?? #theresistence
No way, No How! #ObstructLikeARepublican Merrick Garland!
Applaud all you want.  It's too late.  We will remember you weren't a Trump supporter.  You were a complete jerk.
I don't object to nominee, but want to know why Republicans stalled Obama's nomination?
80 years of precedence support no action on Garland.
What are you smoking? Prove it - show me the precedence.
Those are the facts, try Google if you want details.

80 years of precedence support no action on Garland.
U betcha buddy. This seat was STOLEN. Karma is going to bite you. We will see to it.
FU
Thank you!
It should have been you!
@RichRagamuffin caught Mike Lee on CNN and can only say, "Wow... logic, clarity and honesty." Thank you Senator Lee.
glad your my Senator and thank you for representing the state the way you do please do what you can to get Gorsuch Confirmed
Good decision. It is very encouraging to see law makers who weren't supporting our president before now love him like we do.
How about Judge Garland-fantastic and excellent choice!
Bifen rule of 1992. Read it sometime
I would ask you not to @SenMikeLee , but you don't care what your constituents have to say when they don't agree with you.
First time I've heard him. He sound like a wonderful man. Full steam ahead!!!
thanks Mike.
After the way you all treated President Obama, get ready for a battle royal.  Things go both ways in Washington.
80 years of precedence disagrees with you.
Democrats are Plotting to kill his confirmation.
#MakeSchumerCryAgain
gross
Really "gross" @hidinginhorror @SenMikeLee
really
You sound like a 2 year old (gross)@hidinginhorror @SenMikeLee
that's cool with me. Maybe then I could be president too.
forgot clap emoji. unfollowed.
of course you do....! Kissing his butt much? Enjoy it, because you won't go back. You'll be voted out in a landslide.
ha ha

Hope you stand firm & not let the Dem's get away with annihilating poor Judge Gorsuch. They will try!
His nomination was too late in O's reign--it was justified not confirming him. This is just rank obstructionism.
80 years of precedence support no action on Garland.
that's partially right--Kennedy was appt. in 3rd yr of Reagan's term, confirmed in 88. But close enough!
This pic really is blasphemous.
thank you !
