@SenMikeLee This is how central-controlling leftist mindset works works. This is what we face when they control every aspect of out lives?
@metaphorsbwithu @SenMikeLee hey guys. I live in the UK. We're following yr politics with interest. Our NHS saved my mum's life. Thoughts?
@Wangleberry Good for mum.  Just saw you have no money & will be stopping "free care" for migrants. Canada is going bankrupt too. #rationing
@metaphorsbwithu ...those down on their luck or less fortunate than ourselves, which could be us one day. It is basic, compassionate...
@Wangleberry @metaphorsbwithu I find it compassionate to let me keep the money I earn, with my own life's blood.
@darkageofjoe @metaphorsbwithu what if, one day - and god forbid - you have an accident, and can't earn wages. What do you do then?
@Wangleberry @darkageofjoe Huh? Are you serious? I've taken care of that like a responsible adult. U want someone else to take care of that?
@metaphorsbwithu @Wangleberry I dunno, a back massage would be awesome. Heh
@SenMikeLee The #GOPshutdown is introducing us to the abusive, partisan, unaccountable bureaucracy that is the #GOP.
@SenMikeLee I am going to be taking a list of all of your names into the voting booth with me to vote for your opponents next time :)
@six7six7 @SenMikeLee You do realize u can only vote out the person4 your district and at most one senator, right? You can't memorize that?
@DrKC4 I am not alone. Everyone is being fired nationwide in the next election.
@six7six7 yeah I get that.My point is there's no point in memorizing past the people you can actually vote out. That's all.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz We must stop them.#governmentshutdown
@bennettdavis172 @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz we must stop people from getting healthcare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@GreedyOldPricks Get your website repaired first. I know they're  waiting in Droves. All in the 100's so far have signed up from Cemeteries
@bennettdavis172 lmao. foxhole
@GreedyOldPricks Thank You.
@bennettdavis172 affording people access to healthcare is just a horrible thing! R's are afraid of its success, not failure!  Open ur eyes!
@GreedyOldPricks I have The Right to disagree. Last I checked.
@bennettdavis172 you do, but history will prove you callous and wrong!
@SenMikeLee @ConserValidity Our country is as close to a  tyranny than at any time in our history.
@SenMikeLee @spsmith78 its just a taste of what the left wants for us; health care now, self-reliance tomorrow
@HyperSentinel2 @SenMikeLee absolutely, this is all on purpose
@SenMikeLee that wasn't abusive or partisan at all! Lmao
@Moni53825245 thank you for the laugh.
@SenMikeLee @Navymom21 --and totally IGNORE "hank" who is likely tweeting from his Mom's basement! Angry little troll! Shooo!

@SenMikeLee isn't your state so sorry that it depneds on the Fed for like 87% of its jobs. ok maybe  50% LMAO. puny rep mike lee
@SenMikeLee @MPeper Republicans such hypocrites, as is this tweet! Polls speak for themselves, and USA also needs an Independent third party
@SenMikeLee @proteinwisdom  Term: petulant is my first thought on how partial slowdown being administered .. just to maximize nuisance pain
.@SenMikeLee @Josh_Painter Be quiet and surrender, Senator Lee.  As a Republican, I demand you stop standing your ground. Comity Uber Alles!
@proteinwisdom @SenMikeLee @Josh_Painter or how about we open the fricken government.  We don't need another General Custer strategy.
.@JohnFeehery @SenMikeLee @Josh_Painter Yes, however can we survive without 17% of the federal government being funded?  HELP ME OBAMA!
@SenMikeLee @drdrjojo @SenTedCruz Don't lose focus... #DefundObamacare .  #SenatorReid OWNS this gov't #shutdown .
@SenMikeLee I realize @GOP is bloated&afraid. But how do they not see despotic danger of this admin,&that it will soon have our HC info?
TY! MT @SenMikeLee #shutdown is introducing us to abusive, partisan, unaccountable bureaucracy soon running America’s health care
@SenMikeLee @johngunn2011 Yes sir. The problem is that too many citizens are too worried about their free shit to give a damn about freedom.
@PsychoSix @SenMikeLee and that attitude is what helped end the roman empire
@johngunn2011 Yes. I believe so.
@SenMikeLee @GOP Right On. Stand Strong.  Time to win this fight.  No Deals.  Americans R waking up to high cost of an unaccountable Gov't.
@SenMikeLee @BlueWaterDays you guys better not backdown.  The establishment in our own party is tryin to cave. We need u guys to step up
@SenMikeLee Don't give in! We've gone this far!
@SenMikeLee @TedCruz pls stand ur ground! We have your back out here! #TeaParty #tcot #military #veteran #MAKEDCLISTEN
@SenMikeLee the shutdown reminds us that democracy is the worst system in the world (except for all the others) and government is needed.
@SenMikeLee and when prezpissybritches doesnt gwt his way and stomps and pouts we all get denied that is forseeable
@SenMikeLee How did DC let this happen? Someone had to be asleep at the wheel.
News flash, Mikey. We already have that bureaucracy. One fed, and fifty state. Fifty-one bureaucracies. @SenMikeLee @ConchoQueen
@SenMikeLee You forgot tyrannical.
@SenMikeLee @TopSouthern | Introducing? Maybe for some, but many of us saw this tyrannical bureaucracy take shape years ago.
@SenMikeLee @SOSUSA2016 Yes, the political frauds are being exposed. like PETER KING!
@SenMikeLee @LillyIsFree  A bureaucracy  that will ultumately decide who Lives and who Dies. #tcot #uniteblue #Democrats #GOP
@SenMikeLee @wambam5361 God help us!
@SenMikeLee @judyme3 This is why we sent you to office. You and @SenTedCruz to fight to take our country back from this socialist path
@SenMikeLee @WhitneyNeal Thank you for your service and don't cave
@SenMikeLee Your party is doing just as much as the other one to ensure that govt continues to stay broken. 

You're not a solution either.
@SenMikeLee it is very scary!!
@vendettajane @SenMikeLee The ENTIRE COUNTRY IS ON ANXIETY ALERT!
@SenMikeLee @clark7950 Can a Law be created to prevent the IRS from running Obamacare?
@SenMikeLee @clark7950 A  bureaucracy that is guilty of abusing its power against political adversaries,should not be allowed to run Ocare.
@SenMikeLee @Texgalleslie   Obamacare can be defunded without Senate approval http://www.examiner.com/article/obamacare-can-be-defunded-without-senate-approval … … … via @examinercom
@SenMikeLee If people are upset enough with the post office and the DMV, imagine government in charge of the very breaths we take.
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty Obama has turned dictator. Taking from the American people just to punish them to make the GOP fold. Hold firm!
@SenMikeLee Thankyou Senator for your continued Courage..We are still here with you!
@SenMikeLee which is exactly why ALL OF YOU need to be fired.
@SenMikeLee Why don't you introduce a bill to fight Obamacare? Because you know that America has already decided and you'd lose. Be humble.
@SenMikeLee Be humble. Accept defeat. Move on. If you want to fight Obamacare, introduce a BILL.
@SenMikeLee keep up the good work! #governmentshutdown
@SenMikeLee @BillHutto1 KEEP THE IRS OUT OF OUR HC, SHUTDOWN O's DIVISIVE RHETORIC, STAND FAST & RESIST!
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin  STAY THE COURSE. WE NEED HOPE & YOUR VOICE
@SenMikeLee @sjfalcigno You forgot to say spitefull and racist. Allowing illegals on our soil and not americans, just pisses me off.
@SenMikeLee @DiverGuy1960 Of course you r right. The koolaid drinkers will seevit too late and probably still blame Repubs.
@SenMikeLee @nopenochange We all know that Obama is the Law of the land and Socialism is the new way.
@SenMikeLee LMAO! I'm more worried about the fact that American citizens are too scared to fight for anything anymore. Nation of pussies!
@SenMikeLee Please keep fighting 4 us We're behind u 100%  #GOPHoldTheLine #ObamasWarOnAmerica #ObamaShutdown  #dontcave #ObamacareFail
@SenMikeLee u r so right Mike. If these oh so smart Americans don't wake up we are not even going 2b...anymore. Please hang in there 4us GB
@SenMikeLee Ty 4listening 2us&making sure our voices r heard. Those still not paying attention & w/o a clue r allowing their ignorance to...
@SenMikeLee - How the fuck would you know? We haven't experienced ObamaCare without a government shutdown.
@SenMikeLee @ValerieSMartin It's introducing us to reactionary freaks like U willing to destroy US govt over law approved by all 3 branches.
@SenMikeLee I am proud of you-stand strong!
.@SenMikeLee Exactly right, and Americans must stand up to these people. They're not your father's Democrats. @Taxpayers1234
@corrcomm Exactly. My father was a Dem and would be spitting nails to see what today's Dems are doing. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @Bud1miSScrub32 House of Reps should IMPEACH

@Ad40Dunn paying our bills is surrender?   You're a nutcase.
@marshallInTexas  up yours!
@SenMikeLee @bobmeyer667 Valerie Jarrett is behind all the meanness with her puppet, BO. They hate Americans.
@SenMikeLee @f396 Absolutely!!! How do we get the message to sink into the thick skulled liberals that can't think logically?
@SenMikeLee @f396 Not if you stand your ground Mike
@SenMikeLee @bobmeyer667 People have shown their true faces.  Time to #ImpeachObama and anybody with him
@SenMikeLee @Fingersflying Libs don't see the unaccountability of Obamacare bureaucrats as a drawback. They think it's a freaking FEATURE.
@SenMikeLee @libertyladyusa God help the Vets with access to healthcare if they are refused access to their Memorials. #KingBarakthePetulant
@SenMikeLee Boehner needs to hold firm!  Please deliver the message that we don't want him to cave to this peevish, little man.
@SenMikeLee @libertyladyusa Whew, worried there for a minute. thought u you were talking about the IRS
@SenMikeLee The GOP will be running the health care system?
MT @SenMikeLee: The shutdown introduced us to abusive, partisan, unaccountable bureaucracy soon to be running America’s healthcare system
@SenMikeLee @libertyladyusa Mr. Lee, I'm terrified at the direction our country is taking- progressives MUST be destroyed-not defeated.
@SenMikeLee @WendyZieres We didn't need much clarification; except on asses like the RINO King! @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee @Locke_Wiggins Which makes it no different from any  other bureaucracy. It's not remarkable just a really dumb idea.
@SenMikeLee Thank you 4 being an oath keeper & fighting 4 the American people. #WEthePpl are w/ u & urs all the way! #GodBless #LNYBT #GOP
@SenMikeLee why don't you talk on a topic that you know something about
@SenMikeLee @MelissaTweets Stand your ground Senate repubs
@SenMikeLee motherfucking libtard faggots. make me so angry
@SenMikeLee A trillion seconds = 32,000 years. Only way to end debt crisis is to "realign" the debt. See http://www.debtrealignment.com 
@SenMikeLee @coloradorebecca Riddle me this. .. if there's another #shutdown and Ocare is implemented, guess what that means for patients?
@SenMikeLee #ImpeachObama
@SenMikeLee Hey, Senator, you read Kafka or Orwell lately, 'cause we seem to have landed there. I gotta up my meds. #shutdown
@SenMikeLee At this point, I have NO idea which side you may be referring to. I forgot how laid-back & reasonable #teaparty is. #shutdown
@SenMikeLee @ClearlyTruth Pay attention people. WH #shutdown is brutal attack on citizens.They will also brutalize our healthcare 2 oblivion
@SenMikeLee @ClearlyTruth Mike, you are an American hero!!!! So glad you are MY Senator!

@Aileenk007 @KatyinIndy @SenMikeLee And, Sen. Lee, tell McConnell 2 pound sand.  HE's the Traitor; HE's anti-Constitution; HE needs Censure!
@SenMikeLee @backatone000 Thank you for your hard work Senator , we support you and senators Cruz and rand
@SenMikeLee @backatone000 The BASE stands with YOU, Senator, NOT w McConnell, McCain, Graham & Hatch. WE STAND WITH YOU! @Team_Mitch @GOP

@SenMikeLee Yeah!! I just can't wait for Government to tell me what to eat when I can sleep How much money I can make & Time of my Death????
@SenMikeLee @wakeup1442 we don't need to be sucked into an Anti-American vacuum. #DefundTheGOP #MakeDCListen #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee  we the people don't like GOP getting in the face of leaders making  the different, in Washington DC  stand tall Mike
@SenMikeLee @AmericanSpringg Over our dead bodies. Literally.
@SenMikeLee U r forgetting one thing here Mike! This WH has run rampant over our constitution & country & soon It will be running our lives!
@SenMikeLee hey Mike take your head outta your ass. You tied yourself to the wrong albatross.
@SenMikeLee @ricknofzinger  #DefundObamacare enlightening > TY Reps, I KNOW you are strong enough cuz u Have2b #MakeDCListen & show #truth
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks You are so right! Please don't let them fold! #StayStrong #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks scary ... plus it's sad to see so many Americans just want a handout in exchange for freedom
@SenMikeLee this tweet is made even more amazing by the fact it is said without even the slightest hint of irony.
@SenMikeLee Who will hold you accountable for what you are doing? You mislead, misrepresent,  & lie. Real Republicans aren't libertarians.
@SenMikeLee @lovusa4 lol, you're referring to the same insurance companies that have been running it all along.
@SenMikeLee @Gerilenn really scary if you're already sick.
@SenMikeLee @southsalem WELCOME TO OUR WORLD...........and we can guarantee it will get worse ..................and death panels do exist !!
@SenMikeLee mike we are so fucked
@SenMikeLee You sir, are part of that abusive, partisan, unaccountable bureaucracy. It's sad that you do not see the irony here.
@SenMikeLee @RobertCParker The same man who now blocks access to parks & monuments can block access to healthcare.
@SenMikeLee no one wants a shutdown. Get the government running.
@SenMikeLee @Time4SumAxShun Fortunately we finally have senators who will do something about the abuses.
@SenMikeLee The shutdow is revealing your tenuous grasp on reality and honesty.
.@SenMikeLee Detractors' comments in your timeline show the abusive nature of those w/o comprehension of pluralism. Haters gonna hate.
@SenMikeLee @3Quarters2Day those calling you a liar must have listened to pelosi and posted it BEFORE they read it
@SenMikeLee @3Quarters2Day get it right sir it's "ruining" not running 
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks never give in to the #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee @3Quarters2Day not if I can help it not in my lifetime I have 4 Grandbabies and I will not leave this earth till they r aafe
@SenMikeLee @3Quarters2Day Not if I still have breath.
@SenMikeLee You are either purposely misleading people or you don't under how healthcare works
@SenMikeLee "running America's health care system." Nice attempt to deceive. How is expanding health ins coverate the same as "running"
@SenMikeLee No, it is showing us how paritsan the Repubs can be and are willing to ruin the economy to get their way.
@SenMikeLee Congrats you are everything that is wrong with america. Please fade to obscurity soon and save yourself the embarassment. #Gop
.@SenMikeLee …petty, petulant, chickensh-t, arrogant, uppity, audacious, radical, dangerous, thuggish, tyrannical…
@darkageofjoe
@FreeSmart we describing Harry Reid, or the Democrat party as a whole?
@darkageofjoe Busybodies in general. #MYOBforLIBERTY ;0)
@SenMikeLee @dvanvalk98 power-hungry human shells that have little or no care for this country or anyone in it.
@SenMikeLee The bureaucracy runs everything else.  Healthcare is the next logical evolution of the DC leviathan. @venusvotes
@SenMikeLee There are Millions of us who support what you are doing. BIGGER than health care, it's about a Totalitarian Gov't riding rogue!
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks
@SenMikeLee @LegInsurrection Whaddya mean "will soon be running America's health care system"?  Who cares?  It's already running AMERICA!!!
@SenMikeLee - Nice try.  Do the right thing for the country, and for your party before it tears itself apart - end the shutdown.
@SenMikeLee God help us #Praying for bho's hands to be tied
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks .... CALL FOR A NEW YES OR NO VOTE ON OBAMA'S CR IN THE HOUSE!!! Does the GOP still have the unity to stop it?
@SenMikeLee @JpHaar you can sure tell Leftists commenting by the name calling and senseless comments.
@Rond_m @SenMikeLee that's all they have...no intelligent discourse, just childish name calling; like their leader Obama: Whiner-in-Chief
@SenMikeLee @JpHaar Be concerned America!
@SenMikeLee @suzanne54 they are vindictive and deceitful! Stand strong as we stand behind you!
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Yes it's sad to say that in the future your political beliefs will impact the health care you receive(think IRS)
@SenMikeLee we need a single payer system take profit out of people's lives. We are not just a number
@SenMikeLee If the government defaults, you should be arrested and tried for treason.
.@SenMikeLee @PressSecret  . .  can't be any worse than the broken health care system currently run by campaign contributors & their lobbies
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/million-man-veteran-march.png … we're coming
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks
@SenMikeLee the Obama administration thinks Republicans are terrorists and anarchists. Those 2 groups get great treatment, so will be good!
@SenMikeLee  SET A BUDGET DO YOUR JOB  We want Affordable Medicine not MikeLee
Painting w/ broad brush.Lot of fine public servants.“@SenMikeLee: #shutdown ...abusive,partisan,unacctble bureaucracy to run US healthcare.”
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks keep fighting! America is behind you!
@SenMikeLee the bureaucracy that is shut down is also abusing us because it is shut down? #TeaPartyLogic
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks For the love of God, will someone please stand up and demand impeachment!Convict & put Obama's ass in penitentiary
@SenMikeLee Every time you open your mouth I have to take a dump. #UniteBlue
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Politicians attacking each other is part of d give n take but when d govt declares war on citizens it is despicabl
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Mike, don't worry @megynkelly  will explain that Americans love death panels.
@SenMikeLee @ConservaDeb Stand strong. You are so right- I do not want the government running health care.
@julmem @junipersage1 @SenMikeLee @ConservaDeb can anyone name anything that the government runs efficiently, including the military?
@SenMikeLee @LegInsurrection excellent point just like the IRS.
@SenMikeLee No Mr Lee, I WILL NOT accept that.#DefundObamacare #MAKEGOPDCLISTEN, We know how #IRSSCANDAL works on #teaparty,#Chicagopolitics
@SenMikeLee @lovusa4 Keep up the great work Senator Lee!
@SenMikeLee @gopthinking oh you mean you ?!
@SenMikeLee My own understanding is Justice Roberts declared Affordable Care Act is a Tax'''
@SenMikeLee As in the #IRS? Art Laffer wants a flat tax plus lower corporate rate. Worked for Reagan, but then, he didn't have Obamacare.
@SenMikeLee Not if all Republicans stand fast and keep fighting the good fight!
E. X. P. O. S. I. N. G.   BIG. GOVERNMENT!  @SenMikeLee .@NASCARNAC
@SenMikeLee @ginthegin also known as an argument for privatization and smaller government.
@dave_mears @SenMikeLee  and a critical need for rational lawmakers who read bills before passing them...please dear God.
@SenMikeLee @AIDF911 According to the dictionary, Furlough means NO PAY! Stop supporting back pay. It means the shutdown has no time limit.
@SenMikeLee  #governmentshutup @GlendaRoseMcGee
@SenMikeLee You & 83% of the gov't is getting paid. Don't flatter yourself. If "WE THE PEOPLE" wanted a shutdown you'd have 1. #Revolution
