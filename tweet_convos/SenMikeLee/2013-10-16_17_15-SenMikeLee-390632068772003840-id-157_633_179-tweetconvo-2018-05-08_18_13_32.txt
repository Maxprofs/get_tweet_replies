@SenMikeLee @ibrwab49 Amen and amen...and right now...Ocare has 93+ mil Americans at risk for ins loss...as a nation.....WE ARE HEARTBROKEN.
@TenNamesLater We ARE heartbroekn and we're PISSED OFF, watching our worst nightmares unfold before us.  Muslim dominance slowly unfolds.
@AKSnackShack I haven't heard this from God's voice or His Word. Until then....not true....it's just a nasty little O rumor.
@TenNamesLater I believe efforts to distance the US from God is our downfall, we need to return to One NATION Under God...nuff said?
@AKSnackShack Amen.
@SenMikeLee  I choose to "opt out" of Obamacare on the grounds of Executive despotism.
Get out while you can. the GOP is finished. @SenMikeLee @daxtonbrown
@SenMikeLee @blakespop -When it's a shenanigan such as all-night show 4 attention & $$, American people, GOP & country lose. #stopthestupid
@SenMikeLee @ChuckMuth I say that to make a point that default doesn't matter - you just don't pay your bills for the next 6 months!!
Thank you @SenMikeLee for the good fight! #WeThePeople R still stand with U! We R NOT done yet we know! @The2ndguardsUS
@Kaybirds @SenMikeLee What you said Kay
@SenMikeLee : risking the whole parties chances in 2014 is flat out stupid! Can't make changes when out of office! Foolish and naive!
@SenMikeLee @LovToRideMyTrek You tell Obama, We the American people R coming. He  & DEMS gloating will b voted out.
@SenMikeLee @The2ndguardsUS And the American people just lost
@Cavemaninc @SenMikeLee We will dust ourselves off and get back on our horse.

@SenMikeLee Thank you for fighting the good Fight for us. ..
@SenMikeLee @MatureAmericans Amen
@SenMikeLee @Fore_Warned My god you get it.  Do not allow ANY fight to be cheap, or easy, or especially omitted.
@SenMikeLee @NTSOS Thank you for standing strong. The fight isn't over. It's just beginning. Millions will be hurt.
@SenMikeLee @NTSOS As soon as some of the older establishment types retire, the GOP will never come together.
@SenMikeLee @akstkpkr2 

Shout it from the mountain tops !
@SenMikeLee @marklevinshow I took an oath in the Military to fight all enemies, foreign & domestic
@SenMikeLee And we lost tonight
@SenMikeLee And we're becoming pissed.
@SenMikeLee you got that right
@SenMikeLee THIS is the tweet of the year.. no this is the tweet of my lifetime. Daring to counter the media is step 1. Avoiding it is death
@SenMikeLee Unfortunately, the concept of America is the most tragic victim...I fear political risk is merely a convenient illusion.
@SenMikeLee @DebraPianalto AMEN!
@SenMikeLee @ChuckNellis Thank you for fighting for us. Impeach Obama!!
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator, for being strong and principled.  God Bless you.

@SenMikeLee @TheBluesTex Thank you for fighting for Freedom for all Americans...no exemptions!
@SenMikeLee 2) Millions of us r working n our spheres of influence 2 rid the House of liberal sewage & elect people 2 stand with you. PI
@SenMikeLee Thanks for being there!
@SenMikeLee http://ow.ly/pTvHo 
@SenMikeLee 1) It is the teeth in the Constitution that is causing so much "constipation" for the liberals. Hang in there. PI
@SenMikeLee @ChuckNellis we more than lost, we were sold out by the speaker. Never again getting my support. You will 4 your no vote thanks
@SenMikeLee This is why we need term limits.
@SenMikeLee @ChuckNellis  Glad you stood strong.
@SenMikeLee Millions of Americans are with you. Truth is what you speak. We the People support you.
@SenMikeLee Mike, we are so tired of being used and abused by unethical, unconstitutional politicians. It's gone too far.
Thank you, Sir!
@SenMikeLee It was McConnell who put that amendment in. Can't blame Dems for that!
@SenMikeLee The Constitution gives power of the purse to Congress. Your Branch gave it to Obama. Does that make the Fed govt illegal now?
You said this is Washington at its worst.  I'm afraid this is the best that Washington can do.  Sadly, we need more changes. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee By abdicating Constitutional authority to Obama, you void out the Constitution and yourselves.
@SenMikeLee Why abdicate Const authority over the purse? You know you will never again get 2/3 to objects to Obama.
@SenMikeLee @The2ndguardsUS Hey we agree, but many of your colleagues don't.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your honesty and the good fight.
@SenMikeLee @politsoutherner I love u mike lee.thank u 4 all u do and please keep fighting 4 us
@SenMikeLee Amen! Thank you Senator, for putting the People ahead of the Party on your priority list.
@VoiceofaPatriot @SenMikeLee I second that sentiment! Never give up fighting for the people, & against the Establishments that hurt us.
@PaulMarketos @SenMikeLee Amen
@SenMikeLee Please speak out against McConnell's Kentucky kickback. Make him famous for selling us out.
@SenMikeLee @Eden_Beach we need term limits for all members of congress and no pension, get the corruption out of DC
@spicydo22 @SenMikeLee  Average American aka Middle Class getting royally screwed!
@SenMikeLee Eventually when China turns into an activist investor, our great nation will lose control over it's own destiny
@SenMikeLee and that's the truth
@SenMikeLee Thank you 4 speaking up for us Senator. Please don't stop till we can vote out these DC elite-spendaholics! #tcot #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee OK, whatever you say loser.
@SenMikeLee @SimonTemplarPV “During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act” _George Orwell-1984
@SenMikeLee @nursesuezq America needs to purge ALL politicians w/more than 18yrs service & start w/new leadership in Congress!
@SenMikeLee remember when @SenJohnMcCain campaigning said "fight with me fight with me" he was really talking to liberals
@senmikelee perfectly said. Thank you for for your hard work sir.
@SenMikeLee Thank YOU, at least, for standing up for us. I wish our other Utah Senator would grow a spine.
@SenMikeLee @bloodless_coup THEN WHY WERE WE, THE PPL, BETRAYED....THE RINO's  ARE ALL IN TROUBLE.......THIS IS SUCH BS AND WEVE HAD ENOUGH
@SenMikeLee @danielprofit Mike we believe in you we now know who to vote out.
@SenMikeLee The American people have won. A reckless & vain pursuit that damaged our economy & world standing has been soundly rejected.
@SenMikeLee Will see how serious we desire change come 14! That election will tell the story of USA future! @gopconference @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee Why does CR include provision that increases funding for Olmsted Dam Lock in Paducah, Ky., $775 million to nearly $2.9 billion?
@SenMikeLee @formerbondgirl stand tall you are not one of the status quo, they are back stabbing trash
@SenMikeLee Is a coward. He has not said anything for days, and now bloviates when what he says makes no difference.

@SenMikeLee Keep the Tea....WE DRINK COFFEE!!!
@SenMikeLee Define 'Washington establishment'.
@SenMikeLee Don't worry, a lot of the so called "establishment" will be looking for one of those new p/t jobs b4 long!
@SenMikeLee Beginning to believe there are no Constitutional Defenders...Just members of a new Monarchy.  Sickening
@SenMikeLee B/S an Don't Showboat With Our Vets ! U&Cruz&palin ! Fools 
.@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator for standing with the American people by voting NO on the Debt Ceiling deal tonight. God Bless  #IMPEACHObama
@SenMikeLee @KLSouth Fact is the People wete sold out to backroom deals & pork added to yhe BILL!  GOP lies, like Dems all special interests
@SenMikeLee - We keep losing because of the jellyfish principle - no spines (you, Cruz, Vitter notwithstanding)

@SenMikeLee thank you for the fight. 
American people thank you

@SenMikeLee I don't want to play kick the can! #tcot
@Divapalooza @SenMikeLee @joey40404: @McConnellPress @Team_Mitch the Kentucky Kickback!! Mitch McKickback ! Pathetic
@SenMikeLee We want the names of those that voted to approve! FB it PLEASE!
@SenMikeLee 81-18 is a strong vote of support for your strategy. Clearly, getting America back to work is strongly supported in the Senate.
@SenMikeLee #cspanchat You disdainfully call the federal govt the "Wash Estblmt" You were elected to serve. How about pulling your weight?
@hager_joe @SenMikeLee he did the rest of the  left their pants on the floor
@SenMikeLee so true.  Lack of term limits and MSM are two of the biggest threats to our freedoms.
@SenMikeLee so true.  Lack of term limits and MSM are two of the biggest threats
@SenMikeLee 
No. When idiots like you and megalomaniacs like Cruz are allowed any say in government, America loses.
@SenMikeLee sad day for America and 51% do not know what or do not care what that means. Thank you And to @SenTedCruz @SarahPalinUSA
@SenMikeLee  I can tell...we are going to lose...smh...
@SenMikeLee That is where we are at.   "Avoidance of political risk" means saving their own butts.  Thank you for being an exception.
@SenMikeLee I'm tired of the talk. Approval ratings and results are poor. Fix something, would you? @JonSawyer91 @rollcall #debtceiling
@SenMikeLee There's only u & Cruz.Most of the rest of the #GOP senators r blood sucking leeches who lie. At least Dems r upfront about goals
@SenMikeLee It's amazing how the Democratic Senators practically broke their  arms patting themselves on the back. No respect for HR vote
@SenMikeLee thanks mike for all your work. We will win sir just time to clean house and vote more REAL MEN like you into the house & senate
#Cavemen RT @SenMikeLee: When avoidance of political risk Bcomes dominant motivation,  Washington establishment wins American people lose
@DrMartyFox @SenMikeLee Mamon wins. America loses.
@SenMikeLee @SandFostcat There I only one way to change government an I am not willing to go there yet! You guys SUCK!
@SenMikeLee well said, wish it was practiced more. hope you can start a new trend!
@SenMikeLee I admire your courage. Thank you for doing what's right! Your dad would be proud :)
@SenMikeLee Yes we sure did lose.. Thank you for your fight.  Please don't give up fighting for us.
@SenMikeLee Where did you hear that.....from your sociopathic bed buddy @SenTedCruz?
@SenMikeLee It is a travesty, an evil perversion of the Founders intent to serve the constituents. Instead they serve themselves to A LOT!!
Please start a third party. This two party plutocracy is destroying our country. @SenMikeLee @HeidiL_RN
@SenMikeLee @michaelterry337 No the American People won in spite of radicals like you and Cruz-You dont like Gov stop taking a Gov paycheck
Thank you for fighting for Americans.
We won't forget. Bravo Senators @SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee @senmikelee @DrewMcKissick EXACTLY! Now stop PROJECTING your problems onto those who acted in our interests! #sociopaths
.@SenMikeLee When governance is replaced by political risk for the sake of political risk, who wins? Cuz it ain't you or us!
@SenMikeLee I'm sorry to say, it seems the public is too stupid or too apathetic to care!
@SenMikeLee Republicans caved AGAIN! There, I said it for you.
@SenMikeLee Are you drunk tweeting? Shutting down government not a win for America. Please know that...
Inquilab Zindabad RT @00_anabel: @SenMikeLee @DrewMcKissick BULLSHIT! This in the government R Marxist Fascists on both sides of the fence!
@SenMikeLee @DrewMcKissick Your jump into the Heritage/Cruz shut down was wrong.
@SenMikeLee You are right! Come on 2014!

@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  keep fighting for us, support you men 100%  #wethepeople #ameica
@SenMikeLee My children have lost. My children's future children have definitely lost.
@SenMikeLee I think the advocacy and fight 4 the ACA carried great political risk especially when u consider it still lacks popular support!
@SenMikeLee Thanks for caring about those who pay a higher cost for the shutdown than you and your pals. Women, children, cancer patients.
@SenMikeLee REPEAL 17TH AMENDMENT
@SenMikeLee @DrewMcKissick you sir, need to shut up now. YOU LOST.
@SenMikeLee I agree.  Thank you for standing up for ordinary Americans!
@SenMikeLee amen brother! Thanks for fighting the good fight Senator Lee !
@SenMikeLee You have that right, Senator.  People, it seems, always want to win.  When we choose the right, we win.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz and others; Thank you for taking the stand for US!
@SenMikeLee God bless you Senator Lee for sticking to principle and ignoring political winds, unlike the empty suits that surround you
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your hard work. I appreciate it. Hang tough
@SenMikeLee Hang in Senator. Thanks for your hard work! The fight continues!!
@SenMikeLee It's clear to me, a constituent of yours, that party is more important to you than people. You sir, have lost my vote.
@SenMikeLee 
Time for a #HouseCleaning
#ImpeachObama & Biden and clean out the "dirty" seats in the HOR & Senate. 
#WeThePeopleHaveHadEnough
@SenMikeLee The War is Not over! Obamanation must GO!
@SenMikeLee Term limits now!
@SenMikeLee in this case avoiding severe economic hardship was the motivation, not political risk. If , by chance, we now get debt deal good
@SenMikeLee But when political risk becomes political stupidity as evidenced by the Tea Party all Americans lose.
@SenMikeLee Avoid reckless political risk, please. You caused American people anxiety and serious loss with this stunt. TeaP must go.
@SenMikeLee 
McConnell-Reid Deal Includes $2 Billion Earmark for Kentucky Project WHY?  But we get stuck with OBAMACARE!! I am done with GOP
@SenMikeLee Unfortunately CAREER POLITICIANS only care about their PERSONAL POWER & PERSONAL WEALTH! THEY ARE THE RULING CLASS!
@SenMikeLee start talk about amnesty now and how bad it is. Get out in front. This deal is done #saynoto15%unemployment
Thank you Sen Mike Lee for not giving up the fight and leading for We-The-People against the establishment. 
@SenMikeLee #tcot #teaparty
@SenMikeLee THIS WAS THE FIRST BATTLE, THE ENEMY LINES HAVE BEEN TESTED, WE KNOW THE LEADERS/ALLIES & WHO SOLD OUT, RALLY THE TROOPS
@SenMikeLee stop tweeting and act.
@SenMikeLee Isn't "avoiding political risk" just doing what the people want?  If you go against the people, isn't that increasing risk?
@SenMikeLee Agreed. Keep Fighting for the people. Thanks for ur continued effort
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator for standing up for Constitution loving Americans
@SenMikeLee every time !!!
