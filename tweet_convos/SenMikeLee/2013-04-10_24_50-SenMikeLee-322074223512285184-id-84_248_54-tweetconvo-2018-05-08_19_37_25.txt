@SenMikeLee Thank You Senator for Defending Our Liberty and Protecting our Rights!! You sir are a Patriot!!
@SenMikeLee We need to stop being soft on these people. Its clear their goal is to disarm law abiding citizens. Local security, Local Laws.
@SenMikeLee  Sen Blumenthal just said the gun control bill was just a start. If it passes then the next step, & next until complete control
@SenMikeLee we are behind you patriot !!  ★
@SenMikeLee there is nothing that can or needs to be changed in Our 2nd Amendment. It's Not for Gun Control! It's for Criminal Control!!

@WashingtonDCTea @SenMikeLee  It is a moral imperative and societal self-defense that Obama be arrested for treason,espionage & usurpation.
@SenMikeLee Wish you cared about America's kids and schools as much as you love guns. TJ, Madison, George, said schools essential, not guns.

@SenMikeLee go get'm Senator! Help those of us in socialist states like Massachusetts where we have no representation! @GOALupdate
@SenMikeLee Thank You
@SenMikeLee hold firm Sir, no compromise. Enforce our current laws.
@SenMikeLee Honestly I can't stand the sight of Obama. Cause I served during the cold war and communist infuriate me.
@SenMikeLee Be sure to mention the recent Utah gun fatalities in your public remarks today. #utpol
I agree @21stCenturySLC that @SenMikeLee should mention recent UT gun deaths & how the bill in congress wouldn't have stopped them #utpol
@SenMikeLee We the people don't need congress to protect our 2amendment.It is something we are all born w/ we will protect it ourselves.
@SenMikeLee Good-luck and please convince fellow Republicans to join in the filibuster.
@SenMikeLee God bless you, sir!
Thank you "@SenMikeLee: I am headed to Senate floor right now to share #Protect2A submissions."
@SenMikeLee Can you tweet a link to the actual language of the background check bill? Thank you!! Keep up the good work!!
@SenMikeLee Your fear-mongering on guns is hilarious. Thanks for some good laughs while I was working. It reads like parody. #tcot
@SenMikeLee Stand firm Senator NO MORE GUN LAWS.

Tell Toomey I said "BITE ME"
@SenMikeLee I don't own any guns, don't feel the need, BUT, it really scares me to think that the government would be the only gun owner.
@SenMikeLee next you'll want to add bazookas & grenades to your quest. NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE! No one is taking your right to bear away.
@SenMikeLee All of congress swears to uphold the Constitution. 2A is part of the Constitution. To now limit our rights is treason.
