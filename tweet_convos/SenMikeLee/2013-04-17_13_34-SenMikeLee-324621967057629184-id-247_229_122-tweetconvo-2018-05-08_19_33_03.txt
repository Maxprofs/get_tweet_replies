@SenMikeLee You have failed the American people and your electorate. Shame on you. We look forward to seeing your next election run fail
@DeirdreS @senmikelee seriously, he is a Republican incumbent from Utah! Do you people think before you type? No way he loses
@blakespop where did Utah fit on the spectrum of very strong support for background checks nationwide http://ow.ly/kaK8C  ?
@DeirdreS doesn't matter. He's safe, that's why he voted against Cruz amendment. Btw that Poll is incredibly unreliable.
@blakespop It was one of many similar polls, IIRC. We can only hope that the tide is turning on this as well, even in Utah...
@DeirdreS sorry, on the polls, you can't have a sample size of 750,and call that representative of population. Larger the poll more reliable
@blakespop @DeirdreS why not? Boehner polled 1500 people NATION wide and said his Keystone XL pipeline was supported by 72% of Americans.
@TraceyOaks @deirdres see previous tweet. Larger=better
@SenMikeLee Thank you for reading the 2nd Amendment & obviously understanding it. SHAME ON YOU @SenJohnMcCain  ! You disgust me! #tcot
@cps3indy You tell 'em RB. BTW I see you also have no tolerance for BS. Good for you!
@Elky305 Lol! Absolutely NO tolerance for America's domestic enemies, LIBERALS, at all!!
@cps3indy @Elky305   it's not ok to disagree with 90% of Americans.Get out of NRA's pocket & represent US people. #ShameOnYou
@PattyNicol @cps3indy Now what was that you were saying about disagreeing with American's. I will await the 90% poll you cited. #shameonyou
@Elky305 @pattynicol If that fallacious poll were true, trust me, our spineless "leaders" would've caved-they only care about reelection.
@cps3indy @Elky305 @PattyNicol morning KUTV news quoted 82% of Utahns agree w/gun control measures and 92% of Amreicans. There's your truth!
@TraceyOaks @elky305 @pattynicol Well if it's on KUTV it MUST be true!! Lol!! Obviously NOT!!!
@SenMikeLee why did you vote against the Cruz amendment?
@SenMikeLee so where do stand on #CISPA?
@SenMikeLee SHAME ON YOU! ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. SHAME ON YOU!!
@SenMikeLee Shame on you. #RememberNewtown
@SenMikeLee Shame! Shame! Shame on you! - from a Utah voter
@SenMikeLee how did/will you #vote on #cispa and other #unconstitutional amendments against internet #rights?  How about the #stockact?
@justinfondriest @SenMikeLee I guess no answer?
@SenMikeLee voted AGAINST Bill That Would Have Made Fed Gun Registry A FELONY http://tinyurl.com/c2wsg4y   #tcot #Protect2A #NRA #MS #P2 #ctl
How did you vote on CISPA, @SenMikeLee ?  #tcot #tlot #utah #gop #4A
@SenMikeLee Shame on you for choosing the gun lobby over 90% of Americans - you make a sham of our system - 2nd amendment crap
@SenMikeLee nice
@SenMikeLee How many movie-goers, how many first-graders, how many innocents is your interpretation of 2A worth? Shame on you.
@SenMikeLee Death Has 45 Faces-Janes Sunday Sermon
Shame on You
http://bit.ly/45FacesOfDeath 
@SenMikeLee Please vote for what Americans want, not the NRA. Background checks!
@SenMikeLee As a Utah, I am disgusted. This was demanded by 90% of American voters, you have lost MANY voters, just wait!
@SenMikeLee if 20 dead 6 year olds doesn't make you do the right thing, then I have no use for you. SHAME ON YOU.
@SenMikeLee You're a douche! Preventing a criminal and the mentally ill from gaining access to guns should be a no-brainer.
@SenMikeLee Coward!
@SenMikeLee And that is part of the reason you do not get my vote. Background checks would not hurt the 2nd amendment.
@SenMikeLee thank you
@SenMikeLee PROUD?! to let felons and the mentally disturbed keep buying guns?
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator Lee!
@SenMikeLee It is too easy for criminals to get guns. http://nyti.ms/17215tM   You voted against the American people. #demandaplan
@SenMikeLee <-- Big #FAIL
@SenMikeLee great work upholding our constitution, thank you.
@SenMikeLee You are a disgrace to the American people. Shame on you for voting against the will of the people to protect your #NRAbloodmoney

@SenMikeLee Thank You for upholding the constitution of the United States of America, unlike Obama!
@SenMikeLee And you're proud of that?
@SenMikeLee I will financially support the next person to run against you. Your vote was shameful.
@SenMikeLee - a big thank you!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee 93% of gun households, 89% of Republicans & 85% of NRA member households support universal background checks. #badatyourjob

@SenMikeLee Good vote. Thank you.
@SenMikeLee You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@SenMikeLee Thanks, public enemy.
@SenMikeLee The Toomey/Manchin background check proposal failed because you and your cronies are in bed w/ the gun lobby. Unpleasant dreams
Shame on you @SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee Since the bill had nothing to do with 2A, you are really a liar. You should feel ashamed, but that is something you can't do.
@SenMikeLee Thank You Senator Lee! Keep up the good fight! V/r
@SenMikeLee You followed the $$ the NRA put in front of your fat grinning face & won the day for a few angry Utes. Majority ofUSA wont 4get

@SenMikeLee Why R U smiling for?  B/C your action will help criminal to kill more children?  Shame on you.

@SenMikeLee lol idiots..
@SenMikeLee I'm sure all the dead kids appreciate your vote. A special place for you and your ilk in hell.
@SenMikeLee  Dear Senator:  Pride goeth before the fall.
@SenMikeLee Stand your ground and don't let the Kenyan, Obama destroy our country. We need honest politicians not corruption!
.@SenMikeLee You are a coward and a liar. This bill was no threat to the 2nd  Amendment. #protectpeople
@SenMikeLee  And you are proud of that. This Marine calls.BULLSHIT... So if Charlie Manson walked into a gun show and bought a gun, thats ok
@SenMikeLee Disgusting. Hope you don't call yourself a "Right to Lifer". BORN children have the right not to be shot. @MomsDemand
