Ok Senator Mike Lee. I've agreed with you twice in two days. Socialism is about CONTROL and FAILURE.
you spelled capitalism wrong friend.
Not really. I actually pay taxes and don't want the Govt. handouts.
All right, hope you like privatized fire depts.
Fire Department?? Bad Example, but we can privatized the Post Office NOW!
1. USPS is very good and cheap, and performs vital public service.
Get a job!
Dude ... I'm in the top 2-3% of income earners.
all while the gop is rewriting mein kampf
This is so childish. Can't believe you're my senator. 
Great book!  I just now read it and highly recommend it ... especially, for students!
Yeah, chinese, n korean, venezuelan children!
I hope Bernie wipes the floor with you
Batshit Bernie is an rconomic illiterate.
and Cruz is a spineless, gutless pushover
I would disagree, but fine...doesn't dispel the FACT that Bernie is an economi illiterate.
that's your opinion
His 'plan' was shown to be unrealistic and factually innacurate. I read it...never happen.
.  Ted Cruz is a constitutionalist,Bernie Sanders is a sell-out to Hillary and Soros for .SAD but TRUE.
Hey Mike, Why would Lyin'(your dear leaders words)TED debate socialism, when  ACA is GOP Plan?
Why not let each State choose there own way?Some may choose single payer some won't.
@SheilaGunnReid @SenTedCruz @SenSanders it's called a social democracy. Maybe it's time to relearn your basic poli sci terms
@IsraelNewsLinks @SenTedCruz @SenSanders Karl Marx left wife & 4 children STARVE TO DEATH for this crap. Socialism/Communism.
always amusing as a Utahn for aMormon rail against "socialism" when that was the basis of your religion.
You don't understand our religion if you think that's the case.
I am a recovering Mormon and know church history.
Doubtful. Socialism says the state is god. The church believes no such thing.
what's worse, the Mormon cult or whatever bullshit communism Sanders is pushing?
Sorry, I don't debate with eggs. Have a nice day.
All 3 of the aforementioned Sen.are dumbasses.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Can I plagiarizer the content of that book to spread the Gospel of Socialism?
A definite "good read"!!
that book and the one it was resting against just verifies you're one of the best.
@HaydenLeeMartin
learn how to edit a video old man
@dgeis016 
That's a quick read!
Where's the video of you reaching for The Constitution to show our President about checks & balances?
All of a sudden Eric cared about c&b, but has been silent for the past 8 years.
Were u following me for 8 years? I Didnt vote for Obama 12. Regardless, ur cool w/an ExecutiveBranch w this kind of power?
The ACA insured me, a chronically ill person, when no one else would. It's kept me out of med debt.
My dear friend had to close his dream business & 11 employees are now on unemployment
is not our fault your dear friend couldn't run his business.
how low can you go?

I want a copy. Quick read!

. @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenSanders the ACA has helped utahns, Sen Lee. Recognize this.
It has also harmed others. The duplicity (see Gruber) was enough to turn me against it.
stop debating Bernie and listen! support Trump. Go nuclear it's not about you!
You're a National Treasure, Senator Lee.
Cute! Sanders is going to kill it. #nobodylikested
#NobodyLikesTed
"The Road To Serfdom"  by F. A. Hayek is also good, although it's a slower read.
You are an embarrassment to the state of Utah.
I want that Benefits of Socialism book, very informative!
As terrible as it is for you to repeal ACA-I almost hope you do bc it will put a nail in the Repub party
Best tweet of the year!stop counting!
@dawinship

If Bernie, Hillary and barry are so enamored with obamadoesn'tcare, they should REALLY keep it. 

hes gonna crush that commie
had eight years to come up with a plan and you're joking about Sanders?  You're the joke!
Nice.
Brilliant & Cruz did an awesome "job" last night!  Love you both!
hahahahahaha
lol good stuff
@_weissy @TomKopania @JoeKopania
iconic lol
I have a first edition signed by Fidel!
LOL Apparently he doesn't need help from what I keep hearing!!  :D
, would you please spend a little more time engaging with @SenSanders and a little less time posting unfunny tweets?
dayum.
You nailed it!  LOL 
How can we take you seriously when you sold your soul to the party instead of voting against DeVos?
Wasn't @SenWarren censured for actually saying facts about another senator, but you get away w/ this?
ha!!!! Nice
Childish and ignorant, as usual. Your little book on socialism could just be filled with Medicare, for starters. Plenty more.
Well done!!!!
Good to know that you are NOT interested in listening to your constituents.
there are no benefits to Socialism...
@Kaybirds @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
@ShannonJoyRadio
socialism fails every time it's tried!  Cruz destroyed Bernie last nite. Nothing is free in life.
so much win! Socialism doesn't work kids. Just like that.
Ted did a great job. First time I Watched CNN since election night.
#ForTheWin
need atty. to represent me for filing treason on demon-crats,muslimobama,clinton,and others.
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenSanders Isn't that the Republican ACA "replacement" proposal? Now I see why you put it away, high on the shelf.
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenSanders HAHAHAHAHA JOKES. How about some substantive policy proposals instead, dickbag?
that's a best seller for sure.
make all the jokes you want removing Obamacare will cause 27,000 deaths
Unemployment insurance; Social Security; Medicare; Workman's Comp = socialism. Keep or lose it all, Lee.
Looks like it covers all Socialist benefits! So many pages!
Here's my take on #Socialism& #Republicans: @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
these 2 guys are hilarious
srs question..... where can I buy that book?
Ha ha ha, nice.
@Ambercobia801 @SenTedCruz @SenSanders But Trump wants Single-Payer or he did before he didn't and really still does.
Where can I get one of those?!?!
@itschappy @SenTedCruz @SenSanders There's no books in Lee's office. #fakenews
.@SenMikeLee @RestoreHistory @SenTedCruz @SenSanders that's pretty damn funny. I'm gonna give you that one there fellas, that's funny.
that is funny
He needs 2 learn 2 make his point & move on. ALWAYS talks too long like lawyers & we lose interest. Humanize him
@jetrotter @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
Yo @jaketapper did you or @BernieSanders plant this question for @tedcruz? Maybe it was DWS? Will you all ever learn? lol

â€¦
haha excellent. good luck revamping a broken system. they need you! @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
I can't believe the Benefits of Socialism would not be one blank sheet of paper.  There are none.
I love the football on your shelf!  #reptheY #GoCougars #BYUfootball
I thought the benefit was everyone equally lives in the government slum lifestyle @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
I remember a Dan Qaulye book like that.  But yeah, socialism  sucks!
Socialism brings everyone down to the same level of poverty.
Liberals coloring book
Thousands of your constituents concerned about how they will survive without ACA health insurance. But by all means, mock them 
Brilliant!
You may think this is cute but I doubt people whose lives depend on the ACA would agree.
Tedro is kicking his ass

Ever hear of Social Security? Sir, you are advertising your ignorance.
very clever! 
where can I get that book?

where can I buy one? @SenTedCruz @SenSanders
this is what Bernie needs: Citizens Council For Health Freedom. Get her done. Lower cost, all can afford
Hey @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenSanders - if you think this is the best way to communicate, please quit now.
So people in US have full access to health care? Or you prefer them to die if they can't afford it?
I'm getting the popcorn ready. This is going to be good. Sort of an unfair match though. Lol.
So funny
@m2qm1g @SenTedCruz @SenSanders What a dank meme.  I didnt kno u had it in you, Senator!
So do away w/any debate by ad hominem attacksThat's how the @SenateGOP does it. #CNNDebateNight
@RitaPanahi @SenTedCruz @SenSanders Do you have the readers digest abridged version or maybe one in cartoon format?
@RitaPanahi @SenTedCruz @SenSanders Americans doing exactly the opposite to what Jesus would do. Heal the sick & feed the poor
@RitaPanahi @SenTedCruz @SenSanders Rita are you against or for Medicare in Australia?
...total win...credit where it is due. Good on you sir.
socialism seems to be working well for every other developed country just fine.
how small of you. But certainly not unexpected from a member of the deplorable @GOP
That's MY Senator! Dude fought my battle against DoD after my assault. He can do no wrong.
Excellent, Sen. Lee. S. Sanders needs to recall >100M people were murdered for nothing b/c of socialism.
In Canada, we will never go broke with healhcare.
Can I get that in audiobook?
Haha omg! 
it works pretty well in France and Canada so what do you know nothing
Ah, you should check out the second edition. It's called Denmark, Sweden, Canada, the UK, Japan, Aust...
I like the BYU football!
Burrrrn
@benshapiro @SenTedCruz @SenSanders I should just repackage a phone book and call it people getting screwed by capitalism
Is there a followup book on the drawbacks?
@benshapiro @SenTedCruz @SenSanders cute
Great. No benefits of socialism? I'd like to opt out of taxes and keep all my money for myself. #weresortasocialistalready
#Hilarious 
@benshapiro @SenTedCruz @SenSanders LOLOL
Too funny!! 
where do they sell these wonderful books?
Good suggestion Mike. That will be what Sanders is preaching from. Wish they'd realize socialism is dead
No benefits to Socialism, look at Venezuela eating their dogs. Bernie is a SELL OUT #SorosStooge
One of the most accurate books I've ever read
So glad it's such a joke for you Senator Lee. We're fighting for our lives here. #CNNDebateNight
now that's funny!!!
@GOPjenna @SenTedCruz @SenSanders 
@tedcruz The United States military is the largest and most funded socialist program in the world.

Let's start by cutting that!
"Mikey likes it!" and I do to.
Love it! Ha ha! I can so relate. I lived in a socialist country half my life. So greatful to be in US!
 so true
You're a jerk
@RealBPhil this is a brilliant tweet.
hurrr all of those books are blank or special editions with a size 24 font

@GeorgiaDirtRoad @SenTedCruz @SenSanders The true story of failure of a ideal not fit to print!
It's printed on soft paper?
Benefits of Socialism:  U.S. Military, Public Education, Disaster assistance; Medicare, SIP Health care.
LOVE IT!!!!  Thanks Mr Lee for a great laugh!!! Cant wait to watch this debate.do an fb live party
anybody else get excited to see that BYU football?
cc @ComfortablySmug did you see this?
lol. A+
@scottienhughes @SenTedCruz @SenSanders I can't stop laughing at this. Well done!
I knew there was a reason i liked having you as my senator
Mike Lee you are so embarrassing.

Where can I buy this? 
You are a genius Senator Lee! Let's go Ted!!!
Bravo
Is that the one by Hugo Chavez?
Mike Lee is being extra spicy tonight. Libtards are triggered as usual.
It won't help...CNN already gave Bernie the answers to the questions...its what they do
