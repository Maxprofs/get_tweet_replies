@SenMikeLee @fasonk More time than the Dems took to read OCare? That would take all of about 2 minutes
@LUVofCountry @SenMikeLee ahhhh come on....you're exaggerating! I doubt they spent that long on it!
@fasonk @SenMikeLee I had a rare moment of trying to be nice, lol...and I was assuming they actually read at all.

@SenMikeLee we're not sure we'll be able to keep our dr yet...if not I'm getting my signs ready for #DC ...I won't sit still over this.
@SenMikeLee @cps3indy If we'd read ACA before it was passed we wouldn't have had to read health care plan cancellation notices.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz your assertion that ppl read more Ins cancels than Demos read Obamacare bill is just snarky remark not based on fact
@SenMikeLee - Hey Mike, you might have more cred if you & @sentedcruz provided verifiable info on ACA & not rhetoric only deluded believe
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I AGREE!!! U guys are doing a great job it would just be nice if some of the other republicans would stand by u
@SenMikeLee @DrMartyFox This could eventually be understood as shortening life expectancy.
@SenMikeLee @azblacksheep Sir, thank you.. your the other hero in this struggle.
@SenMikeLee You have to pass it to know what's I'm it!!
@SenMikeLee @Al_Gorelioni We're private company (45 employees)...try & go on the exchange & decipher options on SHOP.  We're screwed!
@SenMikeLee Mike, I am now convinced that Progressive Democrats/RHINOS can't read! or they are just evil.
Ouch! MT @SenMikeLee Americans are spending more time reading health plan cancellation notices than Democrats spent reading #Obamcare
@SenMikeLee the rest of the rhino republicans should have stood strong with you and Ted Cruz
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Lol!
@SenMikeLee @gary4205 They can read? I thought avoiding reading the bill was just a cover.
@SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot those cancellations have a date. What happens to those, if they wanted to, can't sign up for Obamacare?
@SenMikeLee Yes.

@SenMikeLee Faux news is always right
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz GOP Senators are spending more time telling lies when they should be doing their job.
