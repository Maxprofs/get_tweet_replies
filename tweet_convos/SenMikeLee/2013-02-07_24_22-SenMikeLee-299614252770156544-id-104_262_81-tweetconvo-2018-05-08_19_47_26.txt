@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator Lee for your vote to #BlockHagel!
@Mrmom1231 Gabby is very dangerous to the future of bogus left wing narrative. #Benghazi  #Abbottabad @gabby_hoffman @senmikelee
@Mrmom1231 I'm nonpartisan, and registered Dem. you're the looking kooky at this point. Obviously narrative over reality.  @gabby_hoffman
@SenMikeLee Do you find him unqualified because he is hiding something?  If so, what is he hiding?  Who else is with you? #Hagel
@SenMikeLee weary of endless wars we can no longer afford. #Hagel deserves confirmation.
@SenMikeLee Thank You!!!!!!!! Stand strong. So grateful for you!
@SenMikeLee Hold your ground, Senator! @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee thank you for blocking Hagel. No right minded American can support him!
@SenMikeLee didnt #brennan tell FBI 2 read rights 2 #UNDERWARE #Bomber & give him #American #Rights over treating him like an enemy VOTE NO
Stand Firm @SenMikeLee Also stand against bad legislation. Obstructionism is good when it obstructs bad legislation. http://FlagPoems.PoetPatrot.com 
@SenMikeLee Thank you......I hope it's contagious.
@SenMikeLee Hagel shouldn't be Sec.of Defense. Keep up the good fight!!
@SenMikeLee Thank you, Senator - bless you for your clear thought and sharp vision!! I hope many others follow your lead!
@SenMikeLee funny how you have no military experience and are disparaging an American  hero #disgusting #p2
@SenMikeLee you're a lying sack of republican shit. you unamerican unpatriotic asshole.
@SenMikeLee Good, now would u please go over to that ignorant Senator Landrieu and give her a freaking clue? Thanks. #Hagel
@SenMikeLee thank you!
@SenMikeLee I don't support Hagel either. Thanks for standing up to Obama.
@SenMikeLee Good!
@SenMikeLee Obama girl Marjorie Clifton says its not fair to lay blame. Well Obama leaves and goes?? Hillary claims interference on her TV?
@SenMikeLee Q:Name one dumb policy the Israeli lobby pressured Congress into  A: Invading Iraq http://mondoweiss.net/2012/02/the-iraq-war-coverup-what-did-aipac-do-and-when-did-it-do-it.html … … #GoHagel
@SenMikeLee Who cares?
@SenMikeLee 
You were against Hagel even before the hearings. You were told what to do, you will do it and that's who you are. No principles
@SenMikeLee 
Well senator, you are just making excuses. You are bought and paid for. Get out of politics !
@SenMikeLee Rubish. No failure to comply on Hagel's part. Hagel deserves confirmation now.
@SenMikeLee Yea!!! Whoohoo!!! Now if you can get the REST OF THE SENATE to be reasonably & do the same we'll be on a roll!
.@SenMikeLee Thank you for you NO Vote Sir.
@SenMikeLee A great choice and we support you for this decision! #BlockHagel
@SenMikeLee Good. Now can you please tell us where the Benghazi survivors are? And why they are sequestered? Coverup? GOP part of it?
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU So MUCH!!!
@SenMikeLee This Hagel appt is some kind of Political statement by Obama. Hagel is not qulaified to be Def Sec!
@SenMikeLee Maybe if you stuck to real issues, you would, quit the clown show and work for the people, does mean gop gang oppressing people?
@SenMikeLee thank you Senator
Thank you, Senator! THIS is what the American ppl want! @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Good.
@SenMikeLee TY! IMPEACH OBAMA NOW!
@SenMikeLee hope the majority of your conservative colleagues will follow your lead and do the right thing. We need more checks & balances.

@SenMikeLee Thank you! #BlockHagel
@SenMikeLee Thank you Sen Lee. Did Hagel take money from Friends of Hamas? http://www.redstate.com/2013/02/07/breitbart-chuck-hagel-hamas/ … #Utah
@SenMikeLee He will be confirmed anyway. Everything is going to hell in a handbasket in Washington.
@SenMikeLee - cannot support #Hagel for SECDEF. @JohnCornyn @Senate_GOPs @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee 3 thumbs up!!!
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator Lee!!
@SenMikeLee Sorry, Senator. Hagel has more than met transparency requirements. You would never be satisfied no matter how much info you had.
@SenMikeLee YOU ARE PROBABLY THE ONLY #SENATOR TO OPEN HIS EYES & SEE THE TRUTH BEHIND #HAGELS HIDDEN TRUTH. #P2 #TCOT @GOP @THEDEMOCRATS
