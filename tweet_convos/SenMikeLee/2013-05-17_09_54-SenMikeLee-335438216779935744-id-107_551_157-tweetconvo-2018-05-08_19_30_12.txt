@SenMikeLee @ChristiChat What about what they are doing to #overseasamericans?! Targeting #expats with #FATCA #FBAR just wrong!
@SenMikeLee You love the phrase, but lack the mental capacity to detail the scope of what you bray
RT @SenMikeLee: To prevent the next abuse of government power, we need to reduce government power:
@senmikelee mr.Lee go go go for it.
@SenMikeLee @WILORamosFerrer agree small but efficient
@SenMikeLee @ArtistdeeLd How about you guys do this, start over and if a law takes up more space than the constitution toss it.
@SenMikeLee How about doing away with those wasteful ones who do nothing but steal our tax dollars? what am I talking about?
@SenMikeLee Yes, government has become too MASSIVE, frightening, and is endangering our freedom & liberties! #ShrinkGovernment  #tcot #IRS
@SenMikeLee @mipatriot01 No only that Senator. The Congress must #Impeachnow and the Senate must convict.
@SenMikeLee So they,re  socialist governments, large, corrupt and harmful only care about their control over the people !
@SenMikeLee To prevent next abuse of govt power Congress needs to impeach Obama; his rat's nest is national nightmare of ongoing corruption
@LawrenceLange1 @SenMikeLee #RememberWhenBarackObama said to attack your political enemies? Proof (cont) http://tl.gd/lrfo5s 
@SenMikeLee  Axelrod:"Part of being president is there's so much beneath you that you can't know because the government is so vast." #IRS
@RobEngstrom @SenMikeLee That is exactly the problem.  I think G. Washington had four cabinet members and NO CZARS!!
@senmikelee Amen. Amen. Amen!

#IRS #Scandal
@SenMikeLee Gut the #IRS remove the 13th amendment for starters....
@sallyeastman1 @SenMikeLee I will vote for that
@SenMikeLee. I agree that both parties are responsible for the mess we are in. Dems just don't want things to change. Good article!
@SenMikeLee =ELIMINATE THE IRS, DEFUND THE JUSTICE DEPT CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION, GET THE EPA OUT OF THE REGULATION REPRODUCTION BUSINESS,
@SenMikeLee call me a cynic, but I'll believe your words when you all actually do something to destroy #ObamaCare & #IRSPower, not reduce!
@SenMikeLee the real #scandal is giving tea party groups charitable status. Where's the investigation?
@SenMikeLee power corrupts. Increasing power increases corruption. Not exactly rocket science. http://ow.ly/l8KUd  #IRS
@SenMikeLee @cpeppler Ummm...I hope you know that unless you do your job and stop Obama America is gone for good. #ImpeachTheCriminalNow
@senmikelee People get out of the White House through a box- ballot or coffin. It's high time he chose one.
@SenMikeLee @rratkinson Good idea but it would be simpler to ENFORCE the constitution which LIMITS POWER to executive branch
@SenMikeLee @stevenlaststraw Any plans to do something about this current abuse of power...or do you just intend boot dog yapping?
@SenMikeLee OK, start w/IRS, DHS, TSA, DEPT. OF EDUCATION, BATFE. That'll be a good start. Just sayin...
@SenMikeLee Thank you for ALL you do for We The People!!! God Bless You
@SenMikeLee Too many would vote for, "Start All Over."
@SenMikeLee Sign me up and get rid of the rest
@SenMikeLee Here's an interesting article: "Obama Classmate Audited 2 yrs Ago Now Vindicated" http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/obama-classmate-see-i-told-ya-so-about-irs/ … #IRSscandal #tcot
@SenMikeLee  Sen. Lee, to prevent abuse by IRS, DHS, EPA, USF&W, Justice, etc., we need to find the direct link to Obama and Impeach him!
@SenMikeLee Please, Sir, just "reduce government".  And the power will disappear with it.
@SenMikeLee @BV4ME Agreed!
I believe @SenMikeLee deserves huge praise for that article. I 'd hug you if I could. Thank you.
@CAAmyO @SenMikeLee Thanks Amy would have missed that. What a great article. Taking back America 1 election at a time.
Indeed--> “@SenMikeLee: To prevent the next abuse of government power, we need to reduce government power: http://ow.ly/l8KUd " #tcot
@BossHoggUSMC I agree heres a thought the politicians must have a real Civilian full or part time job!
@SenMikeLee @WickedHuntress And also get a real President who is honest and has morals.

@SenMikeLee @tjurman Now time has come to reverse the tide!
@SenMikeLee A lot of these guys are drunk w/power, so good luck w/that!
@SenMikeLee Prosecute IRS employees who broke the law not for example, but because THEY BROKE THE LAW! 
Fire the rest.
@SenMikeLee sir I would like to see alleluia of you do the job you took an oath to do. Stand up for the constitution.
@SenMikeLee @KatyinIndy Sen Lee, the best way to prevent this type of abuse again is to repeal the 16th amend& remove the ability to destroy
@SenMikeLee @mblapeer Yes.
@SenMikeLee @SarahPalinLinks So DO IT!  All Republicans STAND TOGETHER, Get some Dems 2 STAND W/U, #ImpeachObama  FIRE HOLDER, SHRINK GOV!
@SenMikeLee The one and only way to resize #GovPower is to #ReOccupyWhiteHouse period.
@SenMikeLee But unfortunately, the horse has already left the barn_the debt and economic/#Bankster system are at critical -mass !
@SenMikeLee Reducing gov power-w.o. reducing corp monopolistic power would B a dangerous scenario- indeed !
.@SenMikeLee Don't you think it's time for the Fair Tax? #tcot #tgdn
.@senmikelee Miller claimed you can't discern someone's malicious intent, but he then championed the "lack of intent" in the IG report.
DO IT!!!! ==>RT .@SenMikeLee To prevent the next abuse of government power, we need to reduce government power: http://ow.ly/l8KUd  #IRS
@SenMikeLee. If Congress REALLY beleived this, why do the congress pander to those thst " donate" the most money ?
.@SenMikeLee It's the only realistic way to stop this abuse. We have WAY, WAY too much government. @SusanKnowles
@SenMikeLee OK. Eliminate the IRS, Dept of Education, and the EPA. It will help our spending problems too...
@SenMikeLee I created a White House petition to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the #IRS @ http://wh.gov/SOhF 
@SenMikeLee We also need to set an example for future corruption but this can't happen if you guys won't ban together and start impeachment
@SenMikeLee @chinadoll756 I whole heartedly agree Sen Mike Lee! Starting with the #irs. A Flat/fair tax system is a good place to start? RT
@justadad21 @SenMikeLee #FairTax is the best, most #Liberty promoting least tyrannical form of taxation.
@SenMikeLee / thank you for sticking up for Americans! N your tuff questions on theIRS scandal, don't givemr. Miller an inch!
@SenMikeLee 
The IRS Should Be Praised For Giving The Tea Party's Dark Money The Scrutiny It Deserves #IRS #Rush #tcot #Scandal #topprog #p2
@SenMikeLee @hildismom Another huge endorsement for HR 36 via @RepWOLFPress http://wolf.house.gov/uploads/FLEOA_benghazi.pdf …
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks No more reforms. Abolish, then begin anew. No Immigration without reinforcement of borders, language and culture.
.@SenMikeLee , I have a great deal of respect for you Sir, but the problem is Obama and his thugs. Get rid of them, problems mostly solved.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Abolish the Dept. of Education, and Institute vouchers for school choice. Abolish IRS after that. That's relief.
@SenMikeLee That was so disgusting this morning. I don't know how the Pubs didn't reac h out and slap his arrogant attitude!
@SenMikeLee Can you look back into the Homeland Security & Fish/Game raid in 2009 of conservative Gibson Guitar, in light of scandals
@SenMikeLee  The #IRS is politicized by the NTEU and they followed Obamas rhetoric. Time to end Union control of our Government.
@SenMikeLee 
What are 'we' waiting for?
Yet you want to take citizens' Constitutional right to directly elect US Senators away from us & give that right to government.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee OK, you're saying it,http://ow.ly/l8KUd  what's it going to take to make it happen @SenPatRoberts @JerryMoran @RepMikePompeo
@SenMikeLee @Gabby_Hoffman  wanna see it dont just talk about it
@SenMikeLee @jamesbranch3 Amen to that brother!
@SenMikeLee @marklindesr #fairtax levels the playing field for all Americans.  Taxes illegal earnings when spent.
@SenMikeLee 
You are the tool of Corporatists who resent Govt's trying to prevent the next Great Recesdion
@SenMikeLee #BIG SCANDAL!!
@SenMikeLee What is your opinion on the #IRS scandal? What  changes need to be made in #US #tax law? #bseenbheard #CTOT #Obama
Fire the #IRS Flat or fair tax. No loopholes. @SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Great Idea.Start with Term Limits and pay cuts for Congress and making sure that all laws passed apply to Congress

@SenMikeLee Next we need to elect an American! A person who is not influenced by corporate sponsorship! A person of Intergrity, Truth Honor
@SenMikeLee  You said it SEN. LEE and hopefully, the powerful people wont get away with this... my prayers are with you.
@SenMikeLee If this is your chosen stance then you MUST also be for reducing government regulation of private decisions, correct?
