@SenMikeLee @formerbondgirl Communists are all the same in that respect, aren't they? I see more of Putin in Obama every day.
@CharlesdeCharle @SenMikeLee @formerbondgirl Putin isn't a communist
.@YahyaIsrael @CharlesdeCharle @SenMikeLee Really? A former KGB agent isn't a communist?
@formerbondgirl @CharlesdeCharle @SenMikeLee no that doest make him communist that makes him former KGB. Now he he leader of a free nation.
@SenMikeLee @LawrenceLange1 it all starts at the Top And to think this Admin. started the Anti-Bulling campaign  they know how to do it best
Yep. RT "@SenMikeLee Msg behind Obama Admin’s #shutdown bullying is same sent by IRS’s abuses of political opponents: Do what I say or else"
@SenMikeLee There is a desperation in the air. ACA is shredding our rights and revolution isn't out of the question.
Stay strong.
God Bless u for standing @SenMikeLee We r in very dangerous times & we need men of courage like u @SenTedCruz @replouiegohmert

@SenMikeLee @Obama26Obama This Is an Ideological Battle and it is fought in the Hearts and Minds of every American. We must Unite+Fight.
.@SenMikeLee @DLBut Big reason this is happening TO US is that YOU in Congress have FAILED to challenge his lawlessness for YEARS
@DesireeAaron @PaulOD1 @DLBut @SenMikeLee When?????
@Linda_Davis @SenMikeLee The AG is just a Team BO hack, so it's past time for Independent Counsels for IRS, FF, NPS abuses, and Obamacare
@SenMikeLee @We_The_People2 A blatant socialistic reaction to dissension! Remind the peons of the dictator's power over them!
@SenMikeLee Amen Sir!! If you respond, you get the next level threat.
@SenMikeLee @PaulIzzo2 we appreciate you and @SenTedCruz for standing string for WE THE PEOPLE ...it is still VERY impt to us y'all did
@SenMikeLee @Obama26Obama All wrongdoers and those complicit need to be held accountable and prosecuted...especially int'l bankers!
@SenMikeLee @formerbondgirl potus needs antibullying posters his peeps r hanging all over our schools
@SenMikeLee @judyme3 This has been Obama way of governing or dictating sad times for America
Losing touch w/ reality: @SenMikeLee message behind Obama shutdown bullying same as IRS abuse of political opponents: do what I say, or else
.@marshallfitz Your profile tells @SenMikeLee and the rest of us what you are. Why not tell truth: you're a Socialist. #ImpeachObama
@SenMikeLee @Rep_Of_NoFear That's right. It's no fun living under a NAZI Administration. Isn't it time to start Impeachment Hearings?
@SenMikeLee @Senate_GOPs @GOP @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader @RepPaulRyan @PeteSessions @JohnCornyn 
WE DO NOT WANT ANY FORM OF
#NOAMENESTY
@SenMikeLee @pamnsc I couldn't agree with you more.
@SenMikeLee @BelindaKapaun The response to the bullying should be the same as toward ANY bullying. FIGHT BACK! Bullies prefer victims 2 foes
@SenMikeLee @a3auntie@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I proud of what you are trying to do. But we have a lot to do for 2014 elections fire Rino
@SenMikeLee @pinecohen Hooah to you http://youtu.be/Rmz4G4zqMtU 
@SenMikeLee thank you for saying exactly what I have been thinking. #IRSScandal
@SenMikeLee Heard that guests at Yellowstone Park hotel were held at gunpoint by park rangers. Is that true?
@SenMikeLee @SteelMagn LISTEN 2STRONG BRASS. DO NOT CAVE. FRONT MEDIA SHOUT LOUDER! DESPICABLE WH DESTROYER KILLING THIS COUNTRY. DO IT NOW
.@SenMikeLee @DLBut Agree but ARE YOU GOING TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT or just post on Twitter?
@SenMikeLee - GOP is the party holding the country hostage. If Obama is a bully, you GOP members are terrorists.
@SenMikeLee Now I know you r delusional! Your buddy #CRUZ & T-party buddies are strangling America until #ACA is defunded.  Grow up.
@TraceyOaks ACA is off and running! Oops, the website keeps crashing! NSA can listen to a mouse fart in a hurricane but ACA website CRASHES!
@SenMikeLee @BlackIrishI and just like the IRS scandal has been buried so to will these abuses as the MSM works with Obama to blame Repubs
@Cracka_Gavin @SenMikeLee Yep!
@SenMikeLee @LawrenceLange1 But WHEN will you ppl in congress DO SOMETHING about the abuse & lawlessness of this regime!!  PUSH BACK NOW!
@SenMikeLee @Shannonw65 Disgusting, & UNAMERICAN at its core. Someone in DC grow some man parts #MakeDCListen #timetotakeitback #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee @Flower_Power_Us we want our AMERICA back! Stand strong senator!
@SenMikeLee @BradMD  I'm curious, how long will the citizens stand for #ChicagoStyle politics being imposed on us by fiat? #tcot #CCOT
@SenMikeLee I suspect the IRS was "following the money" of criminals like you.
@SenMikeLee you're the only one making demand simply to keep the gov. Open.
@SenMikeLee @KLSouth The "eminence grise" in WH named Valerie Jarrett promised name-taking of & "retribution" towards those opposing Obama.
@SenMikeLee @KLSouth Chicago thug & community organizer. The only jobs on O's brief résumé.
Run the TelePrompTer!
@SenMikeLee Thank U 4 standing strong 4 the American ppl - Obama clearly believes in the "shut up & color" syndrome; Shutup OR #shutdown!
@SenMikeLee ludicrous idea!
@SenMikeLee Hypocrite: a person who indulges in same behavior he condemns others for; Insane: state of mind that prevents normal perception
@SenMikeLee  Barack Obama is corrupt.
@SenMikeLee @punditOcrat so wby dont we get rid of all those pesky power grabbing positions then, including your own?
@LibertarianHC @senmikelee my power grab is absolutely essential
@punditOcrat @SenMikeLee And I'm slobbering with good intentions.
@SenMikeLee  The Dem's need to know theres 2 parties here not just them.All of the people need to be heard and represented not just Dem's.
@SenMikeLee All they lack are the black uniforms, peaked caps and Swastika armbands.
@SenMikeLee AMEN! Thx 4 telling like it is on news this a.m. Need MORE in ur face pushback on #Dembullying! End POTUS #BullyinChief tactics
@LILLYTHEPINK1 @SenMikeLee Fucking embarrasing.
@SenMikeLee we can all see this.  But what can be done?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  We are toast as a nation.  Sad
@SenMikeLee  Despotism
@SenMikeLee honesty and truth are pillars of any debate... 
Thank you... Keep fighting, our beloved America has meant so much to so many!
@SenMikeLee That is the message of his entire presidency. Transforming our system of government and beating us into submission
@SenMikeLee Thought that was the GOP message. We voted for Obama, you know. Kinda like what he's trying to do.
@SenMikeLee Amen
@SenMikeLee It's no suprise that a #GOP senator would stoop so low as to bring up a issue that was proven FALSE. YOU need a reality check!
@SenMikeLee  What does the punishing way the #SpiteHouse has run the #shutdown tell you about how it will run our health care? #tcot #tlot
Right on, we must put an end to the government overreach. @SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot
@SenMikeLee @edwin19401 Sir,why haven't any IRS people been charged with a crime? Do you realize the message that sends?
@SenMikeLee @TradersRule or it could be called old style Union negotiation tactics
@SenMikeLee for WH negotiation tactics, looks like House needs to adopt Tip O'Neil strategies, parties reversed of course
@SenMikeLee @TradersRule  Its called chicago old style politics
@SenMikeLee @whythetruth 

Please stop thinking that Goober is normal American>Actions have one purpose>DESTROY US ECONOMY<He is a TRICKSTER
#ImpeachObama @SenMikeLee @tradethecycles
@SenMikeLee @CANARYorg Obama behaves more like a Godfather in the Mafia than the leader of the free world. #JustGoBO
@SenMikeLee @edwin19401 Stand your ground!
@SenMikeLee Hmm. Didn't I just hear that from the teapeople in Congress? Yes I did.
@SenMikeLee @TBradleyNC Check this out if you want to see what he is really planning. This comes from the Pentagon.
@SenMikeLee @TBradleyNC more than bullying; he is endangering wellbeing of Americans (attack dogs @ memorial & kicking ppl out of homes.)
@SenMikeLee please be more aggressive in letting the public know not raising the debt ceiling is NOT defaulting on our debts #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee this is a lie. You are a liar.
@SenMikeLee Americans informed "get it" we are worried, Obama acting more like a Dictator protected by his "inner circle" everyday.
@SenMikeLee "That's what she said!", LOL. Hey, you, all of you, need to stop jerking the people around before it's too late. Fuck us, right?
@SenMikeLee you are right that our future is there to see
@SenMikeLee  the people voted in 2008 and 12 and said loud and clear we want the ACA
@SenMikeLee #Thuggery & #intimidation: It's the #ChicagoWay
@SenMikeLee That is why we know this message comes from the very TOP.
@SenMikeLee Obama wanted to delay implementation of #ACA?  How does the rest of your lie follow that ridiculous opening?  Kochs prefer Cruz
@SenMikeLee we all know Obama is manipulating the system. He is going for high profile targets to shut down in hopes of destroying the GOP
@SenMikeLee keep up the fight Senator.  This law isn't affordable high deductibles, monthly premiums. Check it for yourself tweeters
@SenMikeLee @Southern_Woman1 I don't really care whose fault it is, lockouts suck because people lose jobs, let's rectify that
@BroncosItaly @SenMikeLee I agree.
@Southern_Woman1 @SenMikeLee and Mike Lee represents Utah so he'd best not piss me off especially since I voted for him
@SenMikeLee The King has decreed. So let it be written. So let it be done. #PresidentStompyFoot and the #DemocratShutdown
@SenMikeLee We need to #MakeDCListen and #FundtheVA  It is unacceptable that our veterans are being used as leverage for the administration
@SenMikeLee @goqivana Apparently all Fascist think alike!
@alaphiah @SenMikeLee exactly!
@SenMikeLee you must stand firm! Keep demanding equality for all Americans.
@SenMikeLee Obama demonstrating just a sampling of what he has in store for the American people. Hope it leaves a bad taste in their mouths.
@SenMikeLee & they're drooling over punishment that #Obamacare will allow. #MakeDCListen #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee You need to get a Government Directory and everytime you say "WHATS THIS" Defund it!
@SenMikeLee Yes he needs the white coats to go get him and take HIM out of that FEDERALLY FUNDED White House and take him to the crazy house
@SenMikeLee REALLY?  Seems more like YOU are the bully, or a petulant child.  We can do so much better - will be glad to see you GO!
@SenMikeLee Up to this point in time, Obama seems to have complete approval from Congress. I hadn't seen any action that would make him stop
@SenMikeLee  Obama is even a lousy King. he will fall.
@SenMikeLee the more republicans fuss, the worse they are going to look -- end #GOPshutdown before people really start to feel its effects
@SenMikeLee So much to do, but must remember we've got to revamp the IRS/usage-consumption or flat tax a must! IRS = enforcement thugs!
@SenMikeLee Actually, Einstein, that is your position!
@SenMikeLee this is so true. #spitehouse is nothing but a street thug anymore. this is worse than Jets vs Sharks in WESTSIDE STORY.
@SenMikeLee sad thing is, you're desperate and for what? to make obama look bad? #obamacare will be great for america that's whats important
@SenMikeLee What can we do to put an end to it?
@SenMikeLee Bullying is trying 2 deny millions affordable health insurance. #obamacare is law. Reopen the gov't and let's move on.
@SenMikeLee They are all the same, they are taking their orders directly from BHO
@SenMikeLee dude it's a #GOPshutdown and everyone knows it -- you guys are getting desperate and everyone can tell
@SenMikeLee you mean the GOP's bullying?
@SenMikeLee  Must read: http://washingtonexaminer.com/park-service-oks-immigration-reform-rally-on-closed-national-mall/article/2536908# …
@SenMikeLee Thank you for holding Obama accountable! We cannot let them get away with #harryreidsshutdown #tcot
