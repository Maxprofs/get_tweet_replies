you're a fucking retard
could be but is right on this time
actually, he's not
it is a rejection of globalized governance whether or not you agree with it
it's white nationalist rhetoric under the guise of freedom
those two interpretations are not mutually exclusive but I'll study up on ur claim
same thing Americans are feeling with trump!
@KellyRek @prepper1776: #Removeallglobalist
@DrJacaranda 
Soros & Rothschild are pissed. 
No it was caused by false information being told as facts. Just like Republicans do in America.
WE WILL VOTE U OUT!!
Also tanked the UK economy...but look over here...talking points!!!
The #brexitvote is a rejection of centralized power and unaccountable bureaucracy, a sentiment widely shared by many Americans.
Brexit is about national independence, national self-determination, national identity, sovereignty, now before it is too late.
yes now please fire yourself and every other politician so we can start over
@LorraineCaracc1 Will you renounce your biggest open borders donor, ClubForGrowth? They DIDNT SUPPORT #Britexit  #GlobalistShill
.@SenMikeLee @NolteNC Including #Trump2016 who I hope you're strongly supporting.
@NolteNC Then Mike Lee should endorse and campaign for Trump.
that's my sentiment!
AMEN
Donald Trump is is on the right side of that. Time to get behind him and defeat Slick Hilly.
support Trump!!!  Your fault if Hillary wins. Put you're big boy panties on and go to convention and support Trump!
@heathrodgirs I don't believe this is the case. I believe it is abuse of central power and elitism. Do as I say leaders
@LeighPatrick Just remember why Eric Cantor was voted out and we'll agree you are getting the message!
@Lamarche Yes. We instead chose an unelected monarch, unelected House of Lords & unelected spin doctors, quangos & bureaucrats.

@NolteNC why I'm voting for @realDonaldTrump
wha r u basing this tweet on?
@BlameBigGovt Well, shared by the ~50% that aren't beholden to the nanny state for its survival.
@Maxinerunner : yes why Ryan, Cruz, Kasich, Bush all need to be out of GOP they are globalists
@instapundit California companies: Start packing now. After #Texit, the move will only get more expensive.
@NolteNC So let's follow your lead and criticize Trump candidacy w/13m+ record votes. FN genius mikey! Either help or shut it!
@aubrynathome Dang right! #COSaction
you don't get out much do you
Oh that life could be that simplistically summarized.
wow you revel in your own countries economic devastation
There is way to do everything. To reduce excess bureaucracy, you don't vote out of the worlds largest single market.
@instapundit yes, Senator it is a rejection of centralize power… Hint
Indeed. Americans, too, could vote and be 10% poorer overnight. Or worse. And led there by this guy.
Amen!
keep it up. You are the best.
...., Russia and Iran.  (just thought I'd finish that for you).
#BrexitVote
so true
@erotao  You mean like our congress? ALL CORRUPTED BY $ AND POWER.
That just resulted in pensioners and investors taking a bath today and a very uncertain future, but ... Freedom .....#Brexit
@NationPride2015 And Canadians
umm no.   The GOP is the single biggest threat to America.
Yeah, Independance to Louisiana!!!
I'm with. Sen Mike Lee on this.
FYI: http://www.goodfieldinstitute.com/pdfs/The%20power%20of%20NO%20and%20other%20single%20words.pdf …
Every major economist acknowledged that this would be bad for the #economy.  It was xenophobic and anti-immigration. #fail
Senator with the greatest respect you clearly do not understand EU. The logic is would you allow any State of the Union to exit?
absolutely!
.@SenMikeLee Completely irresponsible for you to fan the flames of potential global economic crisis. Unbecoming of a United States Senator.
Brexit is at its core, xenophobia! Look it up, Mike!
@yadkinfarm you bet we agree! No large centralized power! Put fed govt beneath state Sovereignty where it belongs!!
When did Chile become a state of the US?  Incredible.
@yadkinfarm 2016 Yr of MEDIA REVOLT Citizen Journalists WILL stop the BIAS RECLAIM THE narrative & DESTROY ALL Biased Media!
Looked up Unnacountable Bureaucracy: "See Utah legislature." Feds help keep states in check. Intended balance of powers.
You,GOP&NRA handed terrorist the ok to purchase weapons to kill Americans. Enjoy this life, rot in hell
No is a chance to actually RULE our own country!
Actually its an endorsement of racism, xenophobia and isolation, which is exactly why you and your minions love it
Be prepared to be called a racist xenophobe by idiot liberals.
stop it!
Yes it is, Senator Lee. And thank you for being a leader in the charge for smaller, fiscally responsible gov't in DC! #Brexit
We must sever all ties with the UN. It's a threat to U.S. sovereignty.
they're going to tank, that's what's going to happen. Not that you'd care
But then, so is the Monarchy #PrisonInc #IraqWar #Oligarchs #NAFTA #SuperPACs #WTO #Banks #Media Vs #union #occupy #vets #BLM
Yes, Wall St is a huge problem #PrisonInc #IraqWar #Oligarchs #NAFTA #SuperPACs #WTO #Banks #Media Vs #union #occupy #vets #BLM
@Fector  Wish it was shared by the GOP.... I can't be part of  Trump's "worker's Party"... I'm old enough to know better.
You over simplified the issue, missed the point & made a non equivalent comparison. 
Congratulations on your Hat Trick of Stupid
You've tried to F us with your illegals. Go F yourself
you benefit from doing nothing as a profession. Can I have your health benefits?
@veriphile Yeah like Gvt that removes caps on Foreign workers pouring in like you tried to do.,.twice.
The #BrexitVote is a result of racism and fear. It's a win for terrorists in UK. Let's pray it doesn't happen in US
fear of the obvious  has a lot of haters barking at you Mike. They know you speak the truth.
No, the #brexitvote is a victory for racial prejudice and tribal bureaucracy in place of shared bureaucracy. I hope USA rejects.
haha you dumb SJW's. I love how a vote for self determination is now racist. You will be triggered this November!
This is what happens when Sheeple follow & listen to a bunch of Wankers/Idiots!!#BrexitVote #WhatHaveWeDone The pound Plummets
except america isn't in any international organization as remotely binding as the eu
How is this toolbag's tweet in my feed?
yes widely shared!

My democracy trumps (excuse the phrase) your ideology! Apples and oranges!
Mormons are crazy yo
You have no idea what you're talking about.  Don't shut up.  it helps us identify the foolish.
I'm glad you got the point!  Thanks.

Thank you, #MikeLee and keep defending the Constitution.
Oh well.
Actually, I'm not, if you examine history, but I respect you right to believe otherwise.
#Texit is next up! #TexasForever 
yeah, but we need a lead r who doesn't have diarrhea of the mouth, or foot in mouth disease. It's a scary situation.
