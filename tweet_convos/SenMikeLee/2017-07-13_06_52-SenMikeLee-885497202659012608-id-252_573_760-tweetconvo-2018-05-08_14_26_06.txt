Don't you think the Senate should have, I dunno, maybe, like one hearing about this before voting?
Wake up and upgrade your education.
Main reasone we gave GOP all 3 branches of Govt over the last 7 yrs is due to the promise of #Fullrepeal. Not a replacement or amendment!!!
We stand with YOU! #REPEALObamacare completely! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
We the People put a GOP majority in Congress on the promise of a full repeal. Not 'repeal and replace', REPEAL only. What is the excuse now?
Keep standing strong Sen.Mike Lee! We stand with you. UnitedforFreedom! Repeal as promised!
Insurance companies used to sell sham policies; when you filed a claim, they would say "That isn't covered".  The ACA changed that.
Senator Lee, this amendment is a piece of crap. Get on the stick and fight for real repeal.
Vote NO on the BCRA. Stand for #FullRepeal & free market reforms. Keep your promise or suffer the consequences. Show us Repubs are better
Here is what Kaiser is saying about it.

Please vote NO on the BCRA. It is no better than Obamacare. We want what you promised - FULL REPEAL, then FREE MARKET SOLUTIONS!
Standing with you. #FullRepeal

Please stand for full repeal Sen Cruz. Your legacy depends on it. Our future rests on it.
When this fails, remind the folks in DC, we don't care about their reelection chances. We want #FullRepeal - get the govt out of healthcare.

Gov't needs 2 get out of business of HC. Since they began getting in HC it's gotten worse.  #fullrepeal #getgovtoutofhealthcare
Mike, Thank you for holding the line against #Obamacare light. @tedcruz
Mcconnell is a proven liar don't trust the rino
Why? A detailed review Gov't control of HC in US including employer paid HC
Insurance ACA VA HC Medicare & Medicaid

It's now quite obvious that the GOP never intended to repeal Obamacare. It has been lying to us for years.
BCRA doesn't offer the ONLY real solution - FREE MARKET! #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom
Thanks for doing what's right for Americans and voting NO on this healthcare bill! I appreciate it.
Vote NO on the healthcare bill.
A vote for the BCRA creates an uninsured problem in Utah. The "free market" will not fix that problem. Health care is not a commodity.
Full repeal!


Please continue to stand up against the pressure and vote NO to kill this bill. #UFF #Fullrepeal
One recent poll on the bill: 12% approval. Hard to get 88% of Americans to agree on anything, but this bill actually brings people together.
Yes, thanks,  come from a large extended family that taught me  well on the value of team efforts, people like to be listened & respected

@SenMikeLee We r counting on u 2 fight 4 us If Tcare goes thru it will get worse if DNC is n control. Setting us up 4socialism
#fullrepeal
Umm.
Please stand up for us. We are counting on U. If RNC lets the bill pass we R doomed. I'm N healthcare. I see the damage it does. #fullrepeal
Thank you. If adding the amendment is the best we can do, PLEASE make sure the full amend is included in the bill and stays there. 
Stand your ground! We The People will not accept anything less than what was promised! #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
FULL REPEAL PLEASE!
#Fullrepeal or vote NO. Trumpcare merely fails faster with Repub branding.
#Repeal
Good idea. This amendment is good
Thank you for fighting and doing whats best for us & our country.Its very much appreciated!!God bless you!  #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom

Sir Patrick Herny stood against the British in the face of death, can we at #unitedforfreedom count on #FullRepeal?http://www.history.org/almanack/life/politics/giveme.cfm …
Americans let DC know, loud and clear: #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom #NoSocializedHealthcare
Cruz/Lee amendment was the ONLY tolerable aspect of BCRA. Without it, just Ocare II. #FullRepeal #UnitdForFreedom
Thank God for you Mike Lee!  Stand strong!  No surrender.  Full repeal. #FullRepeal
This bill is not what you and the rest of the republicans promised.  End of story
#FullRepeal waspromised to the people keep your promises We stand with u Mike

As a citizen, I want you to stand by your promise of FULL REPEAL!!
You are one of the few Senators we can trust. Please hold the line for a #FullRepeal.
Please stand strong! #UnitedForFreedom #FullRepeal


ThanQ Senator Lee. You are a bullwark of Constitutional positions despite the shifting political winds of DC. #UFF stands w/U #FullRepeal
#FullRepeal stop playing with our lives..
Stand on that promise Senator.  Those who will blame or shame you have already surrendered their honor.  We are with you for a #FullRepeal
We hear YOU Mike!  We STAND with YOU! #VoteNoToTrumpcare! #REPEALObamacare completely! #UnitedforFreedom!
Stand strong Senator Lee. We need your patriotism to stand against socialism. Vote no on TrumpObamaCare. #FullRepeal
#FullRepeal. Vote NO. McConnell and the RINOs are going to pull another fast one and mandate socialism. Please. Vote NO.
Please say no to the disaster of Trumpcare 3. It's a horror story!!!
Enough is enough, get it done.
Stand your ground. Americans want a repeal, not a rename. Thank you.
Just called your DC Office, mailbox full but I wanted to let you know as your constituent I want you to vote NO on BCRA
Repeal and replace...
JUST REPEAL THE DAMN THING!!!  AMERICANS ARE SUFFERING FROM THE COSTS. @RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenateMjrLdr @SpeakerRyan @POTUS
It's close enough to blame you for it's inclusion.

#VoteNoBCRA #SaveMedicaid Just say no tp #Trumpcare
To my understanding the fix is in... The amendment intended to get you, Ted and few others on board will be removed in reconciliation. 
Healthcare is not an enumerated power , thus in my understanding not governments job! Tired of government overreach ! FED UP!

The GOP Senators should be embarrassed to even present this evil, cruel, anti-American bill. Soulless!!!
#TrumpCare
22M poor, disabled & kids lose HC 
Preexisting conditions priced out of HC
Age tax 
12% of Americans approve
Vote no
@GOP had 8yrs 2 put something together. This is such an embarrassment. @POTUS needs 2 call out these clowns. @DonaldJTrumpJr @SarahHuckabee
No Trumpwealthcare
Thank you Senator for honoring wishes of the American ppl. Kudos to yourself & @SenTedCruz
Susan Collins is Republican Nancy Pelosi. Liar & can't read.Slowed growth in unsustainable Mdeicaid w Zero CUTS.Ran on Repeal & replace!!
If your amendment is added, we will need massive government subsidies for the pool that insures sick people.
The Republican leadership will not follow through.  They have no integrity and will doom us to single payer.  Good effort.
What about Atlas medical indirect physician care. Is that something that could be used in the new medical plan?
#FullRepeal
No hearings no input from agencies? You are exempt from this insurance! People will die ! Will u choose party over country ? Only for rich!
I cannot support anything less than what was promised. A #FULLREPEAL
Fire McConnell !!!
Why don't you introduce a bill to just repeal Obamacare?
Agree, we need #FullRepeal like we have been promised for seven years.
Thank U @tedcruz 4 supporting Americans who can't afford the premiums/high deductibles. It's a work in progress! @SenMikeLee do your job!!
Why Mr. Lee do you feel you and your family deserves better coverage them the American people?our taxes pay your insurance don't they?
you must be a monster to take the Health care of poor children, disabled and the sick that can't afford insurance that now have coverage
Another FYI - @SenateMajLdr is a lying DC swamp reptile just as bad as any Democrat.
For my wife: Prior to ACA HC premiums growth rate < 11% /yr, since ACA > 42% / year and deductible up 9X.
Need to get rid of the 10 essential benefits, only 5 of which are essential to many, especially those over 60.
When will Mitch McConnell an the RINO's learn? .... this is getting ridiculous
I hope it will be. Forcing anyone to buy something is wrong. Thanks for standing strong!
- Best way to restore leadership in Washington would be to get both McConnell and Schumer to resign.
- Good. It was a bad idea from the start.
Full repeal. Insurance was a working free market, healthcare isn't. Req providers to have one transparent pricepoint regardless of insurer.
Replace allowed amounts for each billable item with a % of national average. Ins then can sell plans that cover x% of national average.
Since allowed amounts are based on a nat ave instead of a network rates patients can go to any US doctor and doctors can set their prices
and if it ain't REPEAL, don't agree.  Please ...
Kill this bill!!! It's either that or killing innocent Americans.
@Im_ur_hklbry it would be nice if you could agree on something.
I am a dr, this bill is bad for patients, bad for GOP voters. Just let it go, and start over
Junk policies that dont meet the min req will hike basic prems & the market will collapse in short order. Debated ad nauseum Pre-ACA
Just do #FullRepeal as you ALL promised us for 7 long years. Last chance before 2018 elections
They are handcuffed Mitch needs to go .. watch him remove these provisions also
Thanks for trying. Mitch needs to go.
I want the whole Cruz amendment
Thanks for your service and representation! GOP is dropping the ball on health care. they have nothing in place? Seriously!? Get It DONE!
@SenMikeLee, just kill the stupid thing. Please.
PEOPLE OVER PARTY!!!!!
Please do not give up Sen Lee.
FULL REPEAL
Why doesn't someone propose a 1% federal tax on all goods sold that will go to medicaid?
To the very end; shenanigans, subterfuge, collusion & sneaky backroom deals will continue.  GOP desperate; must pass something at any cost!
Thanks for that info!  
Senator, someone needs to kick that snail McConnell in the ass to get him on track.
Hold firm @SenMikeLee @RandPaul @tedcruz Do NOT have #GOP own this sinking ship #FullRepeal No where in campaigns was replaced mentioned
If Ted Cruz worked on it it's bound to be screwed up start to finish
@tedcruz @RandPaul eliminating the individual mandate for Obamacare alone will make it a shell of a law, vote yes on MTP
Thanks for keeping us informed..instead of Santa tracker on Xmas eve it's the Cruz-Lee tracker
Translation:  it's not as cruel as I would like it to be but I'll vote for it anyway
Thanks to you, @RandPaul and @tedcruz, you will save this country. KEEP FIGHTING
#FULLRepeal  NOTHING less!
Yes, and the new additions to the @GOP #Trumpcare bill look like this 
Why are House & Senate members & staff exempt from Trumpcare (BCRA) as written? Please Explain to America! Good 4 Them Bad 4 U ?
You all need to agree and do your job or resign. Get it done.
Well hopefully it hurts enough Americans, you can get it passed. The rich have been suffering so much lately, it would be nice to help them.
Where's the open debates and discussion on this 
What happens when someone  has a barebones policy and then gets sick? Wait 6 months for treatment?
Thank you!
What does it take to get new leadership in the House/Senate?  We don't believe our interests or Pres. are being served by Ryan/McConnell.
You and Cruz stay strong
We want govt out of our healthcare - Full repeal - NO replacement
Dear @POTUS DO NOT SIGN WITHOUT AMENDMENT. WHY ARE WE BAILING OUT INSURANCE COMPANIES????
Complete repeal of Obamacare.  Once this is done, Dems would have no choice but to support the piecemeal replacement.
ObamaCare Lite will be the end of the republican party and given the people you have to work with the only doubt is the time of death.
Keep up the good work.
@SenateMajLdr truly shameful!have ONE mtg requiring all senators 2 attend so that all this BS can be sorted thru at ONE time #GOPisfakenews
Repeal!!! Repeal!!! Repeal!!!
I hope to God BCRA does not pass. The American people want a full repeal. BCRA only delays the inevitable. R u Cruz & Paul the only consrvs?
Stand firm > @SenMikeLee @RandPaul @SenTedCruz @SenatorCollins 
We do NOT want  #Obamacare or #Obamacarelite
We voted for a #FullRepeal
Senate leadership is a disgrace
#Repealdontreplace 
#Freemarkethealthcare
Mike you have my permission to slap some sense into the Mitch's head, 2 ins plans in an exchg is a monopoly not a choice #freemktchoice
HEARINGS on the bill?  HEARINGS?
Insurers Rip Ted Cruz's Trumpcare Amendment via @forbes
If the Cruz-Lee amendment has not been added as it existed, the bill CANNOT be supported by conservatives. Period.
I don't know how you people sleep at night.
Because you're afraid it doesn't harm enough people?
Transgender is a mental health issue not a physical ailment
They shouldn't be allowed in #Military 
Taxes shouldn't fund cosmetic surgery
Your amendment is a public policy disaster that would create a death spiral for insuring those with pre-existing conditions. Why propose it?
Frankly Senator - it's not a repeal bill.
Anything Cruz would add to a healthcare bill would be BAD for Americans
I'm looking forward to the Cruz-Lee Antitrust Repeal Act, because the market can never be wrong.
I'm looking forward to the Cruz-Lee TVA Shutdown Act, because if God wanted rural denizens to have electricity, he would have Created it.
I'm looking forward to the Cruz-Lee Overtime Pay is Overrated Act. Oh wait, you already did it.
Tell me, Senator, do you want the 60% of the people who work for an hourly wage to know you are trying to take away their overtime pay?
And before you try any of your Republican lies on me, assume I already know that your bill doesn't include attorney fees for violations,
which is what gives (and has given) teeth to overtime laws since the 1930s.
I'm looking forward to the Cruz-Lee Medicare Voucherization and Out of Pocket Increase Act, b/c 50 year old success stories are blasé.
That's what happens when you disregard regular order so to pass a bill that will hurt millions. You are complicit. #Trumpcare
I found this on http://Mormon.org  . Note the compassion part. Guess you won't be getting into Mormon heaven.
It continues ..."Wear magic underwear, avoid coffee and be delusional."
Submit your financial records to your pastor, so he may properly tax you
Just tell us you won't fold like a cheap tent. Clearly!
Repeal, please!  That has been the promise all along!
How about you demand a hearing so the public can know what is in the bill before it is voted on?
Why are you so concerned about giving Trump a "win"? Why don't you focus less on trump and more on what policies the. I'll advances?
Any bill should be used by ALL..that means #Congress has SAME HEALTHCARE the PEOPLE get swindled into!!!!!
Thank you for keeping an eye on this. America is depending on you.
No hearings, no experts ..no pass
Maybe when you include the other parties senators in the process, y'all will finally be able to repair the damages y'all have done 2 the ACA
You have to vote for it to see what's in it.
We don't want OCare light! Behind you if that's what's coming up. Let free market lower insurance price like everything else, open markets!
Why can't you guys get it together? You have had over 7 yrs to work on this! I wish the Senators could see what we see.  We want results.
How have there been ZERO hearings on this bill? The secrecy in writing this bill flies in the face of democracy. Cowards.
The moment they abandoned promised #FullRepeal for obvious propaganda lie of #RepealAndReplace the entire thing was obviously BS.
