@SenMikeLee hang in there - upending the political power elite is no small task
Correct. Now do nothing let it explode let the dems eat it we need yo win in 2014 @SenMikeLee @SteveSteveolson
@SenMikeLee @BUcrimlaw Thx for exceptional effort. It is not over.. now all realize that ObamaScare is not affodable
@SenMikeLee @USMC_Nightmare not getting it from that article tho.
@SenMikeLee @BUcrimlaw Yes, and thank you for your stance. Proud you did it.
@AngieBeakley @SenMikeLee @BUcrimlaw keep up the good fight
@SenMikeLee @cpeppler I agree. Great article.  And now I'm REALLY depressed.
@Wyona440 @SenMikeLee Don't get depressed.  Remember the most formidable opponents have a weakness. David dropped Goliath with single stone.
@SenMikeLee @dotjenna Too bad it was only an effort.
@SenMikeLee @Pudingtane But will it lead to a majority in both chambers for the GOP?
@SenMikeLee @wivoutadoubt Yes, I agree, a must read for those thinking there was any other way to get the job done. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @BVIhomesales This thing was opposed from day 1 By the People; NO one read the 22,000 pages, but YOU PASSED IT INTO LAW anyway.
@SenMikeLee Thanks, Barack Obamacare!
@SenMikeLee @billinwaco Senator, this article says absolute zero about why saving 0.6% off GDP to defund RomneyCare/ObamaCare was necessary
@SenMikeLee @billinwaco Moreover, it is a good idea to get all those GOPers to stop freeloading off the medicaid backstop AND BUY INSURANCE!
@SenMikeLee @billinwaco GOP & Heritage Foundation agreed with me in 1989. Article doesn't say what's changed,or why default a good idea!
.@SenMikeLee @cheriehend53 think all news idiots need 2 read this. And every R that did not stand with u &  @SenTedCruz  Thank u 4 standing
@SenMikeLee when SCJ Roberts said it cld only be enforced as a tax, & it originated in Sen, why wasn't it thrown out?  @Lrihendry
@SenMikeLee  Please defund liberal PBS.
@SenMikeLee "singin"
Jimmy broke a bone
ObamaDontCare
Jimmy broke a leg
ObamaDontCare
Jimmy GONNA DIE
ObamaDontCare
WILL TAX HIM ANYWAY!
@SenMikeLee @CinderellaMan2 = So Machiavellian. Do our congressmen really conjure all these plots at night, or they just stumble and repair?
@fearlesswidow @SenMikeLee The socialization of America is all but complete. All but a few honest members of Congress were mute bystanders.
@CinderellaMan2 @SenMikeLee = I am glad we have Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, Mark Rubio, Mike Lee, etc. All is not lost.
@SenMikeLee @senmikelee @GiveMeMyRights and accurate to the last word
@SenMikeLee and there are #24Billion reasons #GOP should be imprisioned #UniteBlue
@SenMikeLee  Thank you sir for standing with Senator Cruz, you two did a magnificent job. You gave a lot of people hope!
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Our cov cancelled, on exch rate double ded $5000 co-ins we pay 50%, copay $200=will be uninsured. Don't give up
RT @SenMikeLee This is one of the best articles I have read about why the effort to #DefundObamacare.. http://ow.ly/pZ5AJ   #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work, u crazy TP PIRATE, u! Let ur staff do the reading, U do the HOSTAGE TAKING! Does wonders 4 DCCC coffers!
@SenMikeLee @USMC_Nightmare Shutting down the government and hurting hundreds of thousands of struggling Americans was morally wrong. #tcot
@SenMikeLee Keep up the hostage-taking, u ol' pirate, u! Does wonders for Tea Party favorability ratings--down 13% in 1 month, to 21%!
@SenMikeLee Option Two is still the best choice since the deflation of 
ACA like a balloon is not really practical.
@SenMikeLee unfortunately you stepped on your own message by giving the news cycle a more sensational story of the shutdown. Option two=fail
@SenMikeLee Where are the Americans are we just Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Religious affiliation, ethnicity, division is a tool
@SenMikeLee Mike, the GOP has failed us.  Failing to unite even if it meant going down with the ship has only emboldened our enemies.
@SenMikeLee Tyvm Mike. Everyone needs to read this!
@SenMikeLee  Senator, Thanks for standing up.  Everyone should read this article, including Mike Huckabee, after his rant at conservatives.
@SenMikeLee Time to sweep the decks!
@SenMikeLee how many times was the #24BILLION  you wasted in your fiasco mentioned? "0"  you get #NOPRAISEHERE #
@SenMikeLee you are so delusional!
@SenMikeLee  Thank you for your heroic effort to save Americans from  Obamacare. If your party had supported you, you might have succeeded.
@SenMikeLee Go to bed.  There's enough time to figure out what you're gonna do after you get bounced just like Bob Bennett in the morning.
@SenMikeLee Good article. The comments/discussions are enlightening.
@SenMikeLee Mike, please form a new party; leave us pro-growth Republicans behind, PLEASE. Call it the Anti-Govt Party. Take Cruz with you.
@SenMikeLee Very sad that you thought article was worthy of comment let alone that you thought it was "one of best articles".
@SenMikeLee @DailyPamphlet It's over Mike. The only 2 ppl on Earth who don't know it are u & Ted Cruz. Here's a tip: try actual governing.
@SenMikeLee   Very good article, never saw waiting 'til later as an option. There is far more at stake than just high prices.
@SenMikeLee This. The defund battle was needed to try to highlight why folks should vote GOP to enable repeal. Loss to set up win conditions
@SenMikeLee  Thank you Senator Lee for doing your best to overthrow Obamacare!  It's great to know we have you on our side!
@SenMikeLee @bitsy2569  
Dear Mr. Lee When the dust settles,
I hope your still standing!
You can be a hero
You can be a BONER
#dontflake
@SenMikeLee @ChrizDDv3 well it was supposed to be non appropreated pay for itself since it can't demand its repeal it doesn't work
@SenMikeLee, Congress isn't football. You can't play senator like you're Virgil Carter. Time to come to reality, get serious.
Good article @SenMikeLee ; focus needs to be HOW we DEFUND via Const. power of purse & REPEAL via UNConst. forcing us to buy product
@SenMikeLee of Ray Kurzweil quest of Immoratlity
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2467514/Ray-Kurzweil-shares-plans-immortality.html?ito=feeds-newsxml â€¦

& how will it effect Obama Care & a whole lot more if they do it
@SenMikeLee "To repeal O'care on the establishment plan, GOP needs sudden & sustained electoral success, despite high hurdle of media bias"
@SenMikeLee Excellent article! What I've been trying to put into words myself!
@SenMikeLee @Fitzzer777 Mike hang tough, many are with you.
@SenMikeLee McCarthy nails it what you and Cruz did was critical
@SenMikeLee -obama wants all this stuff he listed-why not do the Pipe Line. It has been ready to go if he would sign off.
@SenMikeLee u and @SenTedCruz will always be remembered by THE PEOPLE as being FOR THE PEOPLE!
@SenMikeLee show it to your colleagues and have a retreat with Senate & Congress to unify message. Blame Obama for ObamaCare! #accountabilty
@SenMikeLee 5.5 yrs for this President and still no focus on Jobs for the American People.  Next Up Imigration.
@SenMikeLee America owes you a great big Thank You #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Move on Senator Lee, there is no justification for ypor actions! #ReplaceMikeLee #GOPshutdown #Vote2014
U kno what really upsets me is how the pundits like @krauthammer and @brithume didn't even see this. #fnc #failed @SenTedCruz & @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Great article that makes perfect sense..if the GOP had stayed together, the Founders had available the perfect check..the Check.
@SenMikeLee 4 yrs without a real authorization/appropriation budget process due 2 Harry Reid is absurd. ACA cost over-runs must b addressed.
@SenMikeLee Please keep fighting for the people of the United States of America.
.@SenMikeLee Thank you, Senator, for standing up for us. God Bless.
@SenMikeLee you are a pasty, doughy disaster. #adhominem
@cashsavior @senmikelee Cash, you're one to talk...
@SenMikeLee Thank you for efforts! Keep it up! @ChrizDDv3
