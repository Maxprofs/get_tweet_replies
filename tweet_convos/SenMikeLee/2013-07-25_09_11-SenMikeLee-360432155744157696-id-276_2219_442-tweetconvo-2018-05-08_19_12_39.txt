You should be fired and have no clue. I guess united is funding part of your reelection? “@SenMikeLee  http://ow.ly/njNJG  #DontFundIt
@keriakos @SenMikeLee Are you in favor of destroying middle class so that a few poor can have healthcare that's not accessible?
@gkenn99 @keriakos @SenMikeLee "A few poor" is nowhere near the reality of the class climate we live in.
@VoteMillennial @keriakos @SenMikeLee as a percentage... It is! But either way, their healthcare isn't my responsibility!
@gkenn99 @keriakos @SenMikeLee Next logical step of your arg is to deny them care completely. Pretty morally shaky for the "faith-based" GOP
@VoteMillennial @keriakos @SenMikeLee Charity is handled by churches and social groups, not government! That's theft and never meets goals!
@gkenn99 @keriakos @SenMikeLee Catholic hospitals provide charity care & run huge deficits. Who helps them? The govt, by not taxing them.
@VoteMillennial @keriakos @SenMikeLee that doesn't seem 2 be the problem of a progressive statist! But charity declines when gov takes over!
2 @SenMikeLee This explains why you & other GOP nuts are willing to ruin our economy: "Republican Health Care Panic":
2 @RonSupportsYou Maybe you would realize our economy has already been ruined by #ACA! Have you bothered to take in any news in last 5 yrs?
2 @gkenn99 The last 5 years were a great improvement from George W. Bush's destruction of our economy (massive job loss & plunging stocks).
@RonSupportsYou ....yeah, almost full employment under Bush.... Tell that story to the millions of unemployed! Get a clue!
2 @gkenn99 "Since the start of the recession in Dec 2007, the number of unemployed persons has grown by 3.6 million": http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm …
@RonSupportsYou ...again, tell that to the millions of unemployed, underemployed, and newly unemployed due to obamacare!
@SenMikeLee @Heritage What do you say to the Republican leaders who have said this will never work and is a waste of time?
@SenMikeLee @t34pic Thank you for your hard work and standing strong!
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek I love how they say "taking over healthcare" when it is a system to provide affordable insurance.
@mattisaac Matt please do more research on Obamacare. Your premise is wrong.
@deanmeek It's the premise of the entire bill.
@mattisaac That's why is such a colossal cluster.
@deanmeek How so?
@mattisaac There is this and 1000's more articles I read against it:
@deanmeek I just don't buy what the article & others like it try to sell. Seems like a lot of conspiracy proven wrong by reading the bill.
@mattisaac Oh please. You read and understand the 2400 pages of Obamacare.  I am in the presence of genius...LOL
NO: @SenMikeLee you're digging your own grave or caving to lobbyists: add YOUR voice to affordable #floodinsurance now or lose votes #Utah
.@SenMikeLee @Mike_Beacham The ACA seems designed in anticipation of what we don't know. W IRS tentacles gripping it, no wonder OB says fini
