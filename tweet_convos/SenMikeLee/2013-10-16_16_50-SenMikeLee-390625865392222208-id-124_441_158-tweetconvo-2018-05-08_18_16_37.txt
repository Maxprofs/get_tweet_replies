@SenMikeLee Mr. Lee we are ready for a third party @rtoberl
@SenMikeLee @Crossbowman1 Thank you Sen. Mike Lee, Sen Ted Cruz & Sen Rand Paul for fighting for Americans! RINOS MUST GO!
@SenMikeLee @CVN70MM2Nuke .. It's No coincidence that Conservatives have the 'Right' moniker.
@BuffaloBill71 @SenMikeLee correct and the left should be left in the failings of the USSR
@SenMikeLee  @FreeLion7 @tgradous when men set their face to do the right thing it is our duty to stand behind them, don't let integrity die
@SenMikeLee Amen!
@SenMikeLee @bloodless_coup a AMEN!
@SenMikeLee You'd think that Barack Heussein Obamacare would act after listening to this! Oh, right, he did this with Banghazi too - no acts
@SenMikeLee Yes! Thank you for doing the right thing! It matters to the people!
@SenMikeLee who makes the call on what's "right"?  you?? #tcot
@SenMikeLee @ClearlyTruth becareful Mike,  RepKING is threaten to go after you and Ted Cruz. He lives in New York (whatever)
@SenMikeLee burning thru $24 billion/1 million jobs for a political stunt is the new fiscal responsibility.  Go home #tcot
@SenMikeLee you just have a man crush on @SenTedCruz - just admit it! #puppylove #youmakeitlookakward
@SenMikeLee Much love 2U, Sen, & the gallant 19, including @InhofePress for continuing to stand for the American People. U R righteous men!
Actually, health insurance companies have been abusive, necessitating the consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee So, when will you begin your noble fight against mandatory car insurance?
@SenMikeLee @ramjet_tx need to make them remember, politics are local too, cut their legs out from under them. Tea party will only grow
@SenMikeLee Thank you for fighting the good fight for America Senator. You are a true patriot.
@SenMikeLee @ChuckNellis Those who fight for We the Peole are very brave.  McCain is the coward who bows to Obama. OUT with his ilk.
@SenMikeLee @ChuckNellis Thanx for standing up for the truth and the ppl!!!
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 Well, I would appreciate a little help here then...
@SenMikeLee I would much rather have someone who I know will fight for me than go belly up and whine "We cant win". Thank You Sen Lee
@SenMikeLee How will we recognize when an abusive government has turned into a #TYRANNY & our Bill of Rights has been stripped?
@SenMikeLee thank you Senator. Let mercy guide your response.
@SenMikeLee @formerbondgirl Yes it is and we support U!
@SenMikeLee You sir, are an idiot and a traitor to America. If you were my senator I'd vote you out!
@SenMikeLee Sen Lee - All I can say is thank you.  You and a handful of others can sleep tonight with a clean conscience.
@SenMikeLee right
@SenMikeLee one of the last things I did with my bro before he died was campaign for you... You made me proud I did thank you...
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU SENATOR!!  You and @SenTedCruz are just the sort of public servants the Founders envisioned. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee abusive government? Bring bills to the floor that end the ruling class. Elected officials pensions? Elected officials Obamacare?
@SenMikeLee Yes Sir :)
@SenMikeLee hurting American families and threatening the global economy is NOT the right thing!
@SenMikeLee @michelledlamber We know you,Senator Cruz and others stood strong against all the other sell outs and we are very thankful!
@SenMikeLee LOL.
@SenMikeLee 
U stand out 4 working 4 the ppl. U have drive,integrity & sincerity. Politics is hard. 
Appreciate ur fight 4 truth & justice.
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek we got your back, keep it up.
@SenMikeLee Thank you!!
.,@SenMikeLee Dont stop the fight. Exposé the tyrant for who he is! Impeach
@SenMikeLee but not when one side capitulates. It just makes the other side stronger to the detriment of the American people. @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee - though so often a thankless endeavor.
@SenMikeLee Right on!
@SenMikeLee What about abusive private industry that is protected by purchased lawmakers?
@SenMikeLee yes it is. Even when you gotta fight both parties.
@SenMikeLee I thank you for standing up for the people who are going to get hammered by Obama care
@SenMikeLee you stopped paying a million people to make a statement. THAT'S abusive!
@SenMikeLee @ishapiro Consider, however, Russell Kirk's point that "prudence is chief among virtues." http://www.kirkcenter.org/index.php/detail/ten-conservative-principles/ …
@SenMikeLee And it is why you @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul &a few others will return to Congress but the RINOs wont #ImpeachObama #DefundTheGOP
@SenMikeLee but meanwhile American citizens get hosed once again by elected reps that f'ing don't care about anything but reelection.
@SenMikeLee  Thank you Sir 4 what U tried to do against all odds. I'm not sure if most will remember about this fiasco but I'll never forget
@SenMikeLee @ElishaNEWS God bless you Senator stand strong! May #God raise up an army of more like you & Cruze!
@SenMikeLee you need not speak for me thank you I would just assume you keep your mouth shut
@SenMikeLee Thanks You!!!
@SenMikeLee yes it is.
@SenMikeLee THANKS for supporting ME.  Thanks for looking out for my freedom.  I know the next 3months will be trying also. GOD BLESS U
@SenMikeLee I've not been abused ever by my American government. Maybe you deserved some government abuse. Were you bad.
@SenMikeLee Stay strong!
Representing your constituents in a government you abhor is a travesty. And anti-American. @SenMikeLee #delusional #TeaPartyShutdown
@SenMikeLee God Bless you. You are a man of high moral standard and I thank you.
@SenMikeLee Quit throwing around the red meat of rhetoric to your teabag hyenas. Abuse(ive) is a black and blue woman living in a shelter.
@SenMikeLee thanks for fighting Mike.  I am done with the Republican Party.  Time for a third party
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek Thanks for trying. We need to clean up DC, starting with our own party, full of elitist establishment frauds.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for having the guts to stand & fight for right when the majority of Republicans in Congress have proven to be wimps!
@SenMikeLee we know how the story ends ! Remember England ?
@SenMikeLee      We are so proud of you. We lost a battle not the war.
@SenMikeLee @ElishaNEWS Stand Firm Sir! We The People stand with you to Defund/Repeal Obamacare & Reign in wasteful govt spending
@SenMikeLee If you support individual rights and freedoms then I expect you to support gay marriage; either that or don't expect my vote
@SenMikeLee Everything you did to destroy our economy was the wrong thing and proved to be ultimately pointless.
@SenMikeLee You Mike and BFF Cruz are the most abusive part of this gov't. U and Cruz cost us $24 BILLION for YOUR SHUTDOWN. UTAH is ashamed
@SenMikeLee Always the RIGHT thing, indeed.
@SenMikeLee Stand strong senator over time Americans will tire of the libs moving this country towards socialism!
@SenMikeLee Exactly! If you think the government is abusive now, wait for #Obamacare to kick in.
@SenMikeLee @LibertyCrabs Hard to fight against a govt who doesn't play fairly.
@SenMikeLee Then do it!
@SenMikeLee @drdrjojo Why isn't he #impeached He is breaking laws,stomping on constitution, senate democrats have no morals,integrity
@SenMikeLee Damn Straight! Takes more time & effort to stand. Sen. I know ur family is making a sacrifice also. Thank them pls as we thnk U!
@SenMikeLee God Bless u and all who stand for hard working Americans!!
@SenMikeLee Keep up the fight.
@SenMikeLee Amen brothah!!  Keep it up!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing up for the American people and for being a true Patriot.
@SenMikeLee people, be ready to win 2014. We'd need a lot of Mike Lees in senate!
@SenMikeLee Thank you sir.
@SenMikeLee. You are right. Its time for all real conservatives to join together and bring back our Republic!
@SenMikeLee I cannot even believe that @McConnellPress put in a $2Mil surprize for his state... We have lost all Faith!
@SenMikeLee to bad GOP leadership doesn't see it that way!  Time for the dinosaurs to retire
@SenMikeLee Thank you so much for all you are trying to do.  Please don't stop fighting to restore America's luster.
@SenMikeLee MOST POLITICIANS ARE ABSORBED IN SELF INTEREST, REFRESHING WHEN WE HAVE ONE THAT PUTS US FIRST. THANKS
@SenMikeLee you don't win by quitting. Never give up. #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee What the H happened today? The Rep party has just made itself obsolete. Welcome to a one party system and dictator obama. Bye US
@SenMikeLee jump boy. Jump. Higher. Fetch.
@SenMikeLee Senator in 13 months, help from TN is on the way.  Stand strong!
@SenMikeLee  thank you ! Keep up the good work !
@SenMikeLee Thanks for fighting. I appreciate that you and @SenTedCruz tried to do the right thing for the country.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for walking the walk and not just talking the talk.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I couldn't agree more. We need more people of your conviction, devotion, and morality if we are to save the republic
@SenMikeLee McConnell getting a $2 billion earmark for Kentucky? Is this true? He was paid off?
@SenMikeLee thanks Mike! Appreciate you standing up for us!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your efforts, the country is no longer recognizable. Next week immigration reform, even less the America we knew.
@bacon4bacon @SenMikeLee please do not let them get immigration....Please!
@garbones @SenMikeLee The king has spoken, will take this up next week, momentum with him, spineless GOP in Senate will back it too
@SenMikeLee tell rep to not give in hold the line tonight
@SenMikeLee Thank you! Keep up the good/right fight!
