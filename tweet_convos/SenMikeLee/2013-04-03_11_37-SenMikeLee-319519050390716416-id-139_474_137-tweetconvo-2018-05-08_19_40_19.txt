@SenMikeLee How can a treaty trump the Constitution? Asking, need to know?
@gracels @SenMikeLee Article 6 of the Constitution states once ratified it becomes the Supreme law of the land. Hope that helps you.
@CatPing @senmikelee "This Constitution, and the laws ... and all treaties ... shall be the supreme law of the land."
@gracels @SenMikeLee Nice to know you were just quizzing the good Senator.
@CatPing I'd love to know where @senmikelee got his authority. Sure ain't Article 6.
@gracels @SenMikeLee I'm not sure I understand where you're going with this. I didn't see anything out of the normal purview of authority.
@CatPing @senmikelee Don't understand what "normal purview of authority" means.
@gracels @SenMikeLee Excuse me, Grace, but aren't you a defense lawyer?
@SenMikeLee All that do not stop UN Fraud President can start packing your bags. @GOP @TheDemocrats @NRA #USA #OATH CONSTITUTION

@SenMikeLee You neglected to say, 56 countries voted for treaty but you supported Syria, Iran and North Korea, the only three No votes.
@SenMikeLee dummy
@SenMikeLee Be prepared for his next move to get around that.  Just stay one step ahead.  We need you!!!
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator.
@SenMikeLee @kkiddkid Go Sen. Lee! Any congressmen NOT voting to prevent US Arms Treaty ratification will suffer from OUR vote in 2014!
.@SenMikeLee Thank you.  But my question: ONLY 34?  What a disgrace & how shameful that 66 anti 2# senators don't uphold Constitution!
@SenMikeLee @LAsThePlace Thank you for standing strong for US values.  We need a list of who stands with u plz.
@SenMikeLee @LAsThePlace Thanks Senator Lee.
@SenMikeLee @SCforfreedom thank you SenLee. Has this country lost its mind ? Letting an international group dictate our rights.
@SenMikeLee @pawleyislgrl I suspect that this won't pass the Senate, but that doesn't stop our buddy Obama.
@SenMikeLee UR going to pay for no votes. "A Message From Newtown" on The Cutting Edge Blog http://worthanopinion.net  #2ndAmendment #GOP
@SenMikeLee Ye shall know them by the company they keep. North Korea and Syria. Nice bedfellows Senator.

@SenMikeLee great job, thank you for trying to preserve our sovereingty!
@SenMikeLee you need more than 34 don't you??? why isn't every Republican against its ratification?
@patriot32 @SenMikeLee I thought with Inhofe's Amendment, this wasn't going to be done. What is going on Mr. Lee?
@SenMikeLee Thank you!  Is there anyway you can get rid of that threat once and for all? We MUST protect American sovereignty!
.@SenMikeLee Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit. You vote in line with the likes of Syria, Iran, & N. Korea. Homegrown terrorist.

@SenMikeLee Thank You Senator Lee. All of your efforts are greatly appreciated. We need to get the Corrupt politicians sent home.
@SenMikeLee Thank you- but I too wonder, how can this supersede our Constitution?
“@SenMikeLee: I have joined 34 senators to prevent ratification of UN Arms Trade Treaty, http://ow.ly/jIm2M ” Thank you!
@SenMikeLee The ONLY path to more gun control is to repeal the 2nd Amendment FIRST and that's not going to happen...
