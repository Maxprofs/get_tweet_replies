@SenMikeLee Is it that Holder can't explain it, or that we're not allowed to know what he knows? @instapundit.
@NumbersMuncher @instapundit @SenMikeLee Holder knows Obama is an illegal President and he knows Congress allowed it to pass. He owns them
@SenMikeLee @PatriotTay @dcexaminer  Eric Holder has made a joke out of our laws and justice, and should b brought up on charges as well!
@SenMikeLee @KayakSandy @dcexaminer  Holder can't explain because there is no Constitutional basis 4  dcvrinchiefs EO's
@SenMikeLee: Att.General Eric Holder can't explain constitutional basis for Obama's executive orders http://washex.am/1hNJ47E#.UulXHGs6hak.twitter â€¦ via @DCExaminer
@SenMikeLee Thank you for saying what needs to be said & standing for the rule of law #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @shad39 @dcexaminer MUST B CHARGING THE BS B/U BATTERY PK-OR ON KNEES- http://shar.es/UNDG2  WHOELSEDID?
Well done @SenMikeLee  this is what oversight looks like.

BTW... How's the contempt case on Holder coming along?
@SenMikeLee @MolonLabeNJ @dcexaminer then why does he still have a job,
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer true recklessness is the only way to describe this administration !!
@SenMikeLee @EternalRiteWing @dcexaminer Mr. Ponzi must be spinning in his grave...
@Rebel_Arky @SenMikeLee @dcexaminer WH&it's flunkies don't bother w/details of the Constitution bc it obstructs their agenda/TheyDon'tCare!!
@SenMikeLee Eric Holder is corrupt.
While nothing is being done about it, how about explaining NOAA & USPS,etc Buying armament?!?! @SenMikeLee @sassyandcowgirl @dcexaminer
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Thank You Mike! keep fighting.You and Ted Cruz are the only true patriots in congress, everyone else sucks eggs!!
@SenMikeLee @blackandgold43 @dcexaminer It's really simple - #COWARDLY #COMPLICIT #GOP leadership in the House.  #UNOPPOSED #DC citizens
@SenMikeLee @heidi164 @dcexaminer Thank you Sen.Lee for exposing lies emanating from& by the WH
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer @Joelmentum
Can he explain magical thinking? Obama is delusional and no one calls him on it. #EmperorsNewClothes @SenMikeLee @Obomination1 @dcexaminer
@SenMikeLee @JBRichard50 @dcexaminer he should be prosecuted for murder at #WACO NO STATUTE of LIMITATIONS,NEVER CAME UP AT HIS CONFORMATION
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Holder is a liar and will do anything he feels like doing.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Sounds like a problem to me!
@SenMikeLee he couldn't explain a dr. Seuss book!
@SenMikeLee is grasping at straws and demonstrating astonishing lack of historical knowledge & precedent to make cheap political points.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer  Eric Holder belongs in jail.
Obama's Executive Orders have the same Constitutional basis as those of previous Republican presidents. @SenMikeLee @nobullchit @dcexaminer
@SenMikeLee @EternalRiteWing @dcexaminer Did Caesar have legal advice when he Used Executive Orders to wrest power from the Roman Senate?
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer @Joelmentum Really they are Buds and will stall everything needed. Who's there to stand up for the peoples rights?
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer "...again, I haven't seen that particular illeg- executive order myself so I (being unaccountable) can't comment..."
@SenMikeLee Sen Lee,  Why, if Obamas Executive orders are not legal. Why can't we stop the man?
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 @dcexaminer -He didn't have to attend law classes. Got stoned a lot slept late & attended student activist mtgs
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 @DCExaminer The night of November2008 Presidential elections HugoChavez said "we have anotherChavez inThe United States"
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 @dcexaminer Since when does a self-proclaimed king have 2 explain anything 2anyone. As 4 Holder, he's the Court Jester.
@SenMikeLee fantastic questioning today of the AG.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Why would any of them? Their all thinking about the next vacation there going to take while Americans suffer.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer I think his intentions are not good
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer  By the way Sir, great SOTU rebuttal speech I heard this morning. You have my support from now on.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer So, it finally comes to the point that Moe can no longer front for Curly? Could it be a crime?
@SenMikeLee The entire administration is a corruption of justice and the rule of law. Just ask J. Christian Adams. @dcexaminer
@SenMikeLee @Gunnerguy1911 @dcexaminer oh yeah he's an expert in constitutional law to like Obama oh and taught it to yeah I get it
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer We have a rouge White House and only you and @SenTedCruz have the guts to after these thugs. We need more like you
@SenMikeLee @DCExaminer Hold his feet to the fire. They should not be getting away with this. Thank you, Sen. Lee.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer @Joelmentum "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Do you find that interesting? Attorney General Eric Gun Runner doesn't have to explain anything to you Sen. Lee.
@SenMikeLee @mefbama @dcexaminer You kicked ass today. That was a nice job.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Masterful questioning of Eric Holder, Senator. Why Obama, and Holder, aren't in federal prison is beyond me.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Tell Holder that we are We the people not We the stupid
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer So what if Bush wrote more ext orders than Obama The number of ext orders has nothing to do with unconventionality
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Bravo to you Sen Lee!  Thank you Senator! Pin him to provide the analysis!
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer He can't explain it because there is none.  He is a criminal and should be in Jail.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer I suspect AG Holder could explain his OWN existence, given the chance. Probably thinks big govt birthed him.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer He's a lawyer fool, the question can you explain it before screaming like a castrate ,impeachment,impeachment!
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer TeaParty congressmen are  constitutionally challenge,bet you need the emancipation proclamation explained by holder!
@SenMikeLee there is no explanation
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer so you need it explained to you when it's your responsibility to know as a senator.You'd fail a Jim crow poll test!
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer idiot he doesn't have too.Why not try reading the constitution which you swore to uphold it's all there stupid!
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer then stop him. We see what's wrong, no what's wrong but only tweet? Please act legislators.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer he can't do it! Button like!  He acts like the king talking 2 his subjects last night!
Save us Mike!! Lee2016?!
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Holder can't speak nor understand legalese...
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer so what, he doesn't have to cuz no one in congress cares enough to impeach their asses.  They rub it in your face
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer of course he can't because there is no basis. The question is what you're going to do about it.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer I can. His entire presidency has been a struggle against Republican SABOTAGE EFFORTS.  It's time to get things done!
@SenMikeLee A concern about Holder is his desire to confiscate guns base on mental health issues. many are labeled for insurance purposes
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer I watched the video - priceless. The DOJ should be required to submit a brief outlining feasibility for each E/O.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer  Just like the rest of the regime, no one knows anything about anything.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Am I correct in thinking holder was just spewing words without rhyme or reason to try to confuse the issue?
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer maybe because there aren't any.
@SenMikeLee if he would read your emails more closely.....he would find that there is no basis.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Wake up Repubs! Administration has been doing unconstitutional acts left & right & u guys do NOTHING!!!  IMPEACH!
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer What's NEXT?
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer TY 4looking out4us. He would've been behind bars by now had it not been 4 do-nothing RINOS @johnboehner @DarrellIssa
.@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer so maybe file a lawsuit, not as a private citizen, but as a sitting senator. Stir the storm. #standing
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Were George W. Bush's 291 Executive Orders just fine then...?
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Ahh...cause there aren't any.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer I doubt that Attorney General Eric Holder could explain the Constitutional basis for sending guns to Mexico, either.
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Has he even read the Constitution? I'm beginning to wonder if any of the current administration knows what it says!
@senmikelee @dcexaminer You should ask him about constitutional basis for the Patriot Act
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer but it doesn't matter to Congress, does it?
@SenMikeLee @dcexaminer Because there are none!
