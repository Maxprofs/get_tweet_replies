This tax credit is a lie & doesn't bennifit the true middle class!
Fails 2 mention it will get rid of head of household & the LOWEST tax rate will b raised from 10% to 12%-taking more money from the poor.
As they take more money from the poor, who need the money the most & give it 2 rich ppl. Hes been bought folks. Trickle down proven 2 b lie.
Noooo
I would be in favour as long as we ended the EITC! And, as long as nobody gets a refund if their credit exceeds their taxes!
Get rid of “earned income.”  Increase credit for adult care.
Common sense gun laws now!
Flat tax
Stop monies 2 Planned Parenthood & use 4 the good of tax paying American families! 
Who doesn't benefit from child tax credits? The rich who can afford many children. The very poor who have no income, birth- or self-control.
Support should be growing for Congress to stop overspending, to start telling the whole truth and to start doing things right.
School vouchers will help the kids out much more.
Please, I'm tired of subsidizing other people's children. What about those of us who don't have kids? What tax credit will you give us?
Even better, get rid of the tax system and the IRS and pass the @FairTaxOfficial !
I agree, but we should do it for all low-wage earners.
No.  On average each year, each child in America results in 140 more tons of CO2 emissions.  We should encourage fewer children.
Also need to increase the income limit for eligibility!
Any reduction in taxes is a step in the right direction because #TaxationIsTheft.
Low #FlatTax rate ... no deductions including charities.
Its a start but flat tax is the way to go, of course no tax would be great!
Support is growing for congress to live on its budget and stop adding more debt. What spending are you going to cut for this tax break?
Not if illegals are able to use those credits to scam taxpayers out of our money like they have been doing even when the kid is in mexico.
This would be a great first step towards a children's #basicincome, otherwise known as a universal child allowance.
We need the fair tax. Then people would know how much taxes they are paying. To many hidden taxes people don’t know about. Fair tax
Sure, but refund should never exceed withholding.
So the tax form will end up being 25 pages. Post card form was promise so I guess this is a no go. Again lies.
Support is growing to #RepealXVI and abolish the IRS because Congress is out of control.
First tweet in three days is about tax credits instead of the worst shooting in American history.
What are you doing to prevent mass shootings in America?
#CHIP ?????????????
I have 3 kids, but why are we giving exemptions for having children? FLAT TAX! Kids are the families choice.
We all need lower taxes children or not don't need special tax breaks , just need tax breaks
bs
How about helping the "real" middle class for once?  You know, the ones footing the bill for the rich and poor alike?
#ZeroTax30K #MoreTakeHomePay
How about CHIP?
That should help all the illegals who file false returns
We don't need more tax breaks, Country is beyond broke.  We should be eliminating tax breaks not adding them!
It is your choice to have children. Why do you get a tax credit for your choice? Give them affordable healthcare then.
There should be a cap on the number you can credit. Being rewarded for having 10 kids will not help solve #utahs problems #utpol
We need a flat tax thus ridding ourselves of the feared IRS. #FlatTax
ABSOLUTELY NOT! Limit to 3
Limit to 0, children are your choice. I have 3, and we need a flat tax.
Support is also growing for meaningful gun reform. Let's help kids stay alive!
We already have laws on guns. Shooter broke many of them. So what do you suggest. Criminals will get guns no matter what laws you pass.
No it's not. It's an enabling mechanism for divorced mothers that already receive child support. It encourages the breaking up of families.
How bout supporting rule of law and declaring the income tax is an excise tax? #Liberty #Freedom #CtC
 so more illegal alien families are subsidized by the taxpayers. Can we get a budgeting mindset representing the taxpayer please?!!
#TrumpTaxScam
 “Trump isn't telling the truth about his tax plan. So I am.”
How about not giving them check for more then amount they put into system. Redistribution of my tax dollars someone who has lot kids NO
Is this going to happen? Or will it be another lost promise from the GOP?
RT @realDonaldTrump Why outsourcing #Healthcare & #Taxes to #Congress/@GOP is/was a failed strategy, b/c @GOP doesn't work for #WeThePeople
RT @realDonaldTrump @mike_pence YOU ARE FAILING #Americans & #WeThePeople. YOUR proposed #Healthcare & #Tax Plans sell us out to Big Corps.
Should state a limit to number of children claimed at 3 per family. I should not have to subsidize more than that per family!
Should my 5 kids have to subsidize your SSI when u retire? You realize you will be getting back MUCH more than you put in, right?
Exclude the illegals in child. Credits!
So Christian, you can watch them die.
wow- not 1 tweet on Vegas- I guess you realize how responsible you republicans are!
Unfortunately, it cannot be used by the children who have been murdered by gun violence.
If it barely makes up for the lost exemptions, you're not helping.
Will this result in more tax fraud and wealth redistribution?
Racist! Of course their white hands!! Gun control now... nun control too.. they're some crazy sistas
Support the estate tax. This country made their success possible; the fortunate can give back --- so others have a chance.
Support the alternative minimum tax. It's a last ditch for when closing loopholes fails.
RT @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer The #American People require both their Federal and State itemized Deductions (all) with no exceptions. #USA
RT @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz #WeThePeople do not want to see COHN at the podium lying to us about itemized deductions. VERY BAD. #USA #taxes
And those of us without children get worked over to pay for everyone else’s kids, gee thanks
We need to be able to deduct state and city taxes.
RT @realDonaldTrump #TaxReform Priority: No Corporate Tax Cut Giveaways to the Big Globalist Corporations. Tax Cuts for The #American People
Sorry corporations are owned by people
RT @realDonaldTrump RE: #TaxReform YOU FAILED because you didn't address/fix the ROOT PROBLEM: BIG CORPORATIONS' TAX EVASION and FRAUD. #USA
RT @realDonaldTrump #WeThePeople #TaxPlan req. changes: Ind & Sm Bus Flat Tax 10% (keep ALL Deductions); Corp. Flat Tax 15% (NO Deductions).
Child tax credit to those who put nothing into tax system.... is just another pandering form of welfare
RT @realDonaldTrump The new Tax Plan from the @GOP, Brady, & Cohn is a sell out to the big Corporations at #WeThePeople & #Americans expense
RT @realDonaldTrump #American People (your voters) reject the GOP/Mnuchin/Cohn/Brady Tax Plan. It's a sell out to big Corps. at our expense.
RT @realDonaldTrump You can pay for your #TaxPlan & everything else by taking the deductions away from the tax evading Big Corps. #USA #tax
You can also partially pay for it by cutting entitlements and not supporting illegal immigrants. Not part of your socialist agenda though.
Who do you think pays corporate taxes. Consumers.
RT @realDonaldTrump YOU were not elected by #WeThePeople & #Americans to sell us out to Big Business & the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. #USA
Instead of another slight-of-hand tax credit, let's just do a usage tax & do away with Income & corporate tax altogether! What a Novel Ideal
And then reduce some of the right offs!
With a usage tax, there are no write-off's.  It is essentially a federal sales tax... you pay taxes on purchases - no more than 10%.
RT @realDonaldTrump RE: #TaxReform plan, YOU don't screw over 25% - 30% of people to benefit any group. Everyone gets the benefit or No One.
Hey Mike, Why isn't congress exposing that paying income tax voluntary? I listened to the hearing with the IRS admitting it.
seasoning your food you understand sir and Than food will Test good to everyone 
Tax cut for all, only way to boost economy, everybody that pays taxes need cuts. Non-payers are 50% of the population. Improve econ $ growth
No way!
WHY?
Ridiculous.
How much NRA money do you except?
Asking for a voter. Me!
Balance power and money sir 
Support is growing for a national gun registry, and stricter gun laws. Your thoughts?
Currently writing a paper on this topic in law school Mr. Lee
Sorry sir I'm not Have a kid
