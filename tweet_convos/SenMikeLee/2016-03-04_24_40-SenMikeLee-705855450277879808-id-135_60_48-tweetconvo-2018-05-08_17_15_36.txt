@SenMikeLee You are the Devil. Holding back funding for an Emergency? http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/senator-puts-hold-lead-bill-says-flint-doesnt-need-fed-aid … #pathetic @gop
@the_roncarey @frelling_cute @SenMikeLee @GOP But RW always looks out for their own, just look at US disaster relief during Obama admin
@JimJlr2 @the_roncarey @SenMikeLee @GOP And Katrina with Bush.
@frelling_cute @the_roncarey @SenMikeLee @GOP Yes
@SenMikeLee @JohnMcCain @JeffFlake elsewhere: 
Navajo leader feels betrayed by EPA over 'contaminated' water supply
@SenMikeLee Don't care. You are owned by satan.
@SenMikeLee Keep standing up for poisoning children.  It makes you look so admirable.
@SenMikeLee get it together Senator. Do your job and send aid to Flint, MI
@SenMikeLee thanks for blocking the bill for #FlintWaterCrisis God looks down at you for not helping shame on you!!! Out gov won't help
@SenMikeLee No Mormons in #FlintWaterCrisis, I find you predictable. Regardless of color, #UncleSam wants you in despair. #Kanye2020
@Laztheteacher @SenMikeLee State of Utah has more toxic water than any state. That's the irony here. #FlintWaterCrisis
@PaulJElliott that's poor leadership. sounds like @SenMikeLee doesn't have a clue or no ones met his demands. #TermLimits
@SenMikeLee HYPOCRITE
@SenMikeLee If they were white mormon babies in Flint, you'd have been first in line asking for aid and savaging anyone standing against it.
@SenMikeLee Simple Google search shows the State & Gov of Michigan HAS asked for help. Stop the blame game & be part of the solution.
@SenMikeLee I read this all the way through. It is politicians never letting a crisis go to waste. Par for the Democrats like Hillary & BO.
.@SenMikeLee  You are truly a monster. What would you be doing if YOUR children were being poisoned?  #FlintWaterCrisis  Another #GOP fail.
@SenMikeLee ur a villain straight up
@SenMikeLee  I support you on this Senator Lee!
@SenMikeLee Who pays 4 education&care of all those brain damaged&sick people?Churches?Really?We already tried them&they were dismal failure.
@SenMikeLee #MikeLee loves that he is able to persecute people using his ignorance and tea party devotion he wants more ppl to get sick
@SenMikeLee Give his office a call in the morning to lift the block on clean water. (202) 224-5444
@SenMikeLee the ppl of Flint deserve clean water, not your self righteous grand standing
@SenMikeLee Yeah, really terrible that taxpayer money is being spent to help taxpayers. You seem fine with corporate welfare, however. Tool.
@SenMikeLee Michigan does NOT have a budget surplus which makes you a big liar on top of being a complete heartless a**hole.
@SenMikeLee I think you need to drink unfiltered Flint water until you stop blocking the bill.
@SenMikeLee What a guy - holding up the funding for Flint. You're a good mormon, right?
@SenMikeLee What a dick!
@SenMikeLee you wouldn't know compassion and empathy if it fell on your pee-tart rock of a head...
@SenMikeLee @POTUS @POTUSPressPool @PressSec 1st time UTAH has ANY  kind of crisis. NO FEDERAL $. none. @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews
Utah Senator Mike Lee - The Party of Lincoln dumps on Flint Michigan
#MillennialMonitorPolitics @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Wrong.
@SenMikeLee why are you hurting Gods children to save a hopeless ideology,no wonder trump and the KKK found a home in your party&leadership
@SenMikeLee I can't believe your colleagues would learn from this tragedy and try to avoid it in their states, thank god you object
@SenMikeLee Americans don't have clean water to drink. You should do all u can 2 help not hold up a bill to help them. #yourpartoftheproblem
#FlintWaterCrisis https://twitter.com/senmikelee/status/705855450277879808 … @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Why do u think it is proper for you to stop a vote on the bipartisan bill? U can vote against it Just more obstructionist policy
@SenMikeLee are you evil or just stupid? It's a serious question
@SenMikeLee Only monsters have the lack of feeling this man has towards people who continue to suffer damage from a wholly GOP tragedy.
@SenMikeLee Lee is secretly holding up a bill to help the residents of Flint, Michigan, who have been poisoned by their own water supply.
@SenMikeLee PRO-LIFE!!! THINK OF THE BABIES!!!!! EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS!!!! Until they pop out of the womb. Then it's fuck 'em. Right? @GOP
@SenMikeLee Is this stunt to help coverup @onetoughnerd 's culpability in creating #FlintWaterCrisis ? "Signs point to yes" #GOP
@SenMikeLee Believes Flint Has Enough Aid. 
https://shar.es/1CzWKA 
@SenMikeLee the people of Flint deserve drinking water... Shame on you
@SenMikeLee You make Utah look bad
@SenMikeLee pos
@SenMikeLee very Christian of you to not want to assist flint. What if your kids had to drink lead water?
@SenMikeLee we came to the federal government for help BECAUSE of @GovRickSnyder 's failure to act on our behalf. Do your damn job!
@SenMikeLee yeah no shocks here. You don't think there's an emergency? @GovRickSnyder 's failure to act isn't a clue that they need help??
@SenMikeLee Making a name for yourself/GOP as the worst of government
@Grimcrotch @SenMikeLee @onetoughnerd we got people dying here, kids being f*cked up for life, this is more urgent than some f*cking policy
@SenMikeLee Sounds like you are political grandstanding not everyone else.Yet another Republican obstructionist;The party of No & Me not We.
@SenMikeLee Make your GD GOP Governor do the right thing!!
@SenMikeLee Do you Support Trump? If yes maybe i'm your man . But do it clear. If Trump wins USA presd. we fix the problem.
@SenMikeLee go to Flint and drink the water.
@SenMikeLee You're a Disgrace of community, blame it on the Utah-tax-payers right? did you know you're poisoning Utah-voters of Flint..
@SenMikeLee Seriously WTF is wrong with you? Are you that hateful you will continue to deny help to the people of #FlintWaterCrisis
@SenMikeLee wow ... what a miserable POS you are ... I hope you are hounded beyond belief for your decision to hold up that bill #Flint
@SenMikeLee I assume you call yourself pro life ... That's a gross misrepresentation
@SenMikeLee stand firm
@SenMikeLee shame on you. Children need help think of the children.
. @SenMikeLee you have to take a good look at yourself and see if you're the kind of person God intended.
@SenMikeLee Is this really because LDS Church still secretly hates black people? It's ok. Let it out, champ. You'll feel so much better.
@SenMikeLee your a monster
@SenMikeLee So Repub gov poisons Flint and now you block aid? Hope we don't have water problems in Utah. Maybe you should drink Flint water
@SenMikeLee 

Of course, when Utah is hit with some type of crisis, you'll be singing a different tune
Hi @SenMikeLee  you're talking about Michigan - the same state that that's ignoring Detroit....right? -> http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2015/04/detroit_bankruptcy_could_signa.html …
@SenMikeLee go back and read your Bible until you learn that Jesus wants you to help not turn away needy people.
@SenMikeLee The Samaritan woman gave Jesus water. Jesus gave the wellspring of eternal life.  Flint asked for water. You: Let them eat cake
. @SenMikeLee John 4:7 when a When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"  Flint came to you?
@SenMikeLee Children were poisoned due to the govt failing to protect them. I would love to hear what you believe deserves $ over that.
@SenMikeLee Your cowardly actions against safe drinking water in AMERICA is another reason I will NEVER vote Republican again after 44 yrs..
@SenMikeLee stop w/ the #feelthebern crap. This guy is just plain garbage. & I'm a republican. This guy would never do this in his district
@SenMikeLee do the right thing in Flint. Imagine your kids being poisoned through no fault of their own!!!!! Don't be a despicable repub!!
@SenMikeLee There is a problem though, Michigan has an inept Governor.
@SenMikeLee another fine example of the obstructionist party. Refusing votes while people's lives hang in the balance.
@SenMikeLee why don't you go drink the water and tell us if you feel the same. you lazy welfare case, do your god damn job and help your ppl
@Pauletcoffee @SenMikeLee these aren't his people. Flint might as well be China to this jack wagon. Guy is turning his nose 2 the rust belt.
@SenMikeLee the fact that ur delaying something so serious is beyond me. I don't understand how someone could be so wrong
@SenMikeLee disgusting. I clearly u have no morals or value. Refusing to do ur job aka obstruction
@SenMikeLee Ridiculous as always.
@SenMikeLee - Another reason why your party is quickly becoming obsolete - inhumane policies disguised as "prudent government". What BS.
@SenMikeLee Would you block aid if this were happening in your district? #FlintWaterCrisis #Flint @SenSanders #FeelTheBern
@SenMikeLee and the @GOP stands for #stopprogress   Can the federal government cut all funding to Utah since you don't believe in it
@SenMikeLee thank you for your support of people in another state. Your a real leader you and your @GOP are the real reason why USA sucks
@SenMikeLee This is ridiculous and inhumane.  Now is not the time for political posturing, people are dying!  #Criminal #FlintLivesMatter
@SenMikeLee You didn't have much to say about the children of Flint who desperately need your help. That would be very Pro-live of you.
@SenMikeLee #Flintwatercrisis: what went wrong

@senmikelee the Federal Government does NOT need to be in the Water, or LAND Business.....PERIOD
@senmikelee the Michigan deal was done on purpose, as was the Animus River Spill, to get the UN to manage our Land and Water, UN Agenda 21
@senmikelee ANYONE proposing we allow the UN to Manage ANYTHING in the US needs Tried and HUNG by the neck until DEAD.
@CHIEF_CABIOCH @SenMikeLee we need to stop all funding to the UN, tear up our membership card & kick it off us soil..lol
