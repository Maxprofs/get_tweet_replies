#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
Oh please stop the hysterical photo ops!! Those paid stooges were in the hall protesting before the HC bill came out!!
Not true #NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer
POINT 7: CBO lays blame for the insurer exit largely with Trump.   In fact... 12 
Where are they getting all this money? STOP lying to the American People sit down with Dem's and Fix Obamacare for us the peo u work for.
It also lacks ethics. Giving huge tax cuts to the rich and decreasing Medicaid funding is unethical and will kill people. #NoAHCA
how can repealing ACA w/out replacing or fixing performing w/humility? you will cut millions off on healthcare - many many Utahns.
How do you propose that we protect the poor? Utah already cut Medicaid. The LDS church doesn't help everyone.
Harvard Study Released, last night

If you pass #Trumpcare 
It will KILL 217,000 people 

#Medicaid
Missing Ingredient for most of your House of Representatives and Senate is CONSTITUTION. Does anyone know what it says?
"Humility" presumably includes looking at health care systems in other similarly situated countries for ideas, also.
Lee is right on this & lets start with Term limits on congress. They all are a part of getting nothing done & 20 trillion debt.
Do United States elected Senators @SenateGOP have the President's back ? #BetterCare #BCRA Better Care Reconciliation Act #RepealAndReplace
Simple Fix Obamacare, Liars in DC keep promise #FullRepeal its that simple! Cure illegal immigration enforce Everify @tedcruz @RandPaul
The #GOP's last 2 #HealthCareBills suggesst they can/will do worse. Make UT proud @SenMikeLee be #CenterRight and take care of us in the USA
What about making insurance open across state lines??? Sad but GOP establishment are pure crony corporatists!
Somebody needs talk about the lobbyist money influence.  For health care bills so far this century; Lobbyist 3  American People 0.
Lobbying is freedom.  Key is for Americans to not elect politicians that have no principles & can be bought! Article V term limits a start!
This Nation exist for the sake of the people not for corporate oligarchs. It is time to classify corporations as subgovernments put in line
Sick and tired of Corporations and special interest subverting the domestic tranquility of this nation this country belongs to the people
We need to shut down the Federal Reserve get out from under the World Bank and limit corporate influence on our government...
It has become evident that in order to retain their oligarchy the elitist mainly liberals fool the people ino  believing BS likes democracy
Every one of us knows all too well that it is the Almighty Dollar that rules our Nation rather than the rule of law as this Republic was met
Make sure we do NOT sidestep these:
Money, money, money, money... Current GOP agenda regarding healthcare
Where was the famous free market savior to the health care system BEFORE the ACA?
DO BETTER MAKE ACA BETTER INSTEAD OF LEAVING PPL TO DIE
WHAT IS XTIAN ABOUT THAT
GOP shd not make kids/elderly/disabled/ vets to suffer to enrich their donors. 
Arrogance an incompetence = trump admin.
Amen brother Mike!
probably a little humanity too
What do you know about Humility?
Baby Killer!
The missing ingredient is money! Since 1970 the wealthy's tax down from 90% to 36%.  Reform taxes fairly and all will be well!
Some sort of Republican repeal and replace must be passed. Get the best deal you can, but you must pass something.
AMEN
Aren't you a part of "arrogant incompetence"?????
We voted to give you a majority and you have FAILED to "repeal and replace" O'care!  We should raise money to boot you out of office!
I voted for u beginning to regret. All I see is hot air no spacifices. Hatch thinks it's a start. Start or get out of way. Facts not openion
Glad to see this! I'm an American abroad who just called to ask you to vote against this bill out of compassion but your voice mail is full!
Yes! The BCRA is horrible for 98% of Americans & the big tax cut for the top 2% is ridiculous.PLEASE VOTE NO!
Thank you. Please urge @SenCapito to join you in opposing this heartless legislation.
The real missing ingredient is your refusal to deal with reason all of the GOP ideas are terrible:
PLEASE oppose Trumpcare! We need more covered, more funds coming in or premiums will rise Bigly!
Healthcare affects dems & repubs. Why not let both dems & repubs decide it? Work together. Find a bipartisan solution everyone can accept.
Show you've got great heart & vote NO
STOP cut on health care older,women,disable,kids deserve,do your job serve and protect+90%American taxpayers
Please stand strong against BCRA.
Wasatch front but for some reason, we keep cutting Medicaid?
Give me the "tough economy" line, go ahead
Please stay strong Senator Lee. This bill is a disaster and will lead to single payer. We cannot have that.
Correction after CBO: #The400 $1,000,000,000,000 #TheRestOfUs -$21,000 
Why do Republicans hate poor people?
Since Washington DC is ruled by a Nobility Class that answers to the Nazi Royal Crown, I don't see you doing ANYTHING to oppose them.
I wish I could like and retweet this 100 times! Maybe it's time to leave the GOP, Sen. Lee?
Also compassion! Ryan pretends under this bill people can "choose" 2 not buy insurance. Their only choice will be between food or insurance.
Please keep fighting the good fight.  #SinglePayerNow
Please vote no
We are working in removing the Washington Incompetence, but you are not up for a vote yet.
Try HUMANITY over Humility. #utpol

Looks like you're a cheap date - you only held out for $66,750! Orin Hatch got almost $500,000! You got ripped off!  You should vote no now!
Do not ruin healthcare coverage for 250 million just to cover 8 million!! That would be INSANE!!
Please sir DO NOT WEAKEN on this position. You are spot on. Rates on Obamacare have risen 140%. Just get the government OUT of the ins. biz!
Not one #TeaParty Senator should vote 4 Trumpcare @SenTedCruz @marcorubio @SenSasse @RandPaul - If you do - SINK in the D.C. swamp!
Humility is certainly missing in DC. The "missing ingredient" in BCRA, however,  is providing health care for all in America. Vote against!
SINGLE PAYER FOR ALL, NOW!
Delete your account.
Letting the states pick and choose coverage isn't the answer either.  Medicare and Medicaid should not be touched. fix what we have mr Lee.
Mike Lee keep up the good work
My understanding is that GOP bills allow for liberal exemptions to states to decide what is best for them.  If so, that's a good thing.
Lotso f missing pieces.  Time to go back to square one and act like you care about constituents
#YouHaveThePowerToSaveUs #VoteNoAHCA #TaxCutNotHealthCare #peoplewillDie  #help #findFundsNegotiateDrugPrices #RegulatePharma
Republicans need to get it together and Pass this health bill and tweak things in the second phase LETS ACT LIKE REPUBLICANS !!
Please don't vote for this disastrous healthcare bill. People will suffer and/or die if it passes. My government makes me feel ashamed.
GOP shudn't pass socialist-lite HC bill. Daft. Conservs- either full 10th amend/all2State or fix ACA. GOP shud b answer 2 Dem, not DNC-lite
Stand tall, do the right thing, vote NO! You'll work together to find a bipartisan plan. Lives are on the line #ACA  
No recess for congress.  Sequester yourselves until you negotiate this bill for Americans.  You can't just obstruct w/o solutions. Negotiate
You have had 7 years to figure it out. When will you stop funding Planned Parenthood, causing us to be accessories to murder?
How much are Koch Brothers paying you to vote against GOP healthcare? Vote for unfunding P.P., and the 30 hr workweek, mandatory purchase
Sen. Lee. Please work with @POTUS & compromise 2 Repeal/Replace OCare.Unite @GOP 2 pass it or GOP will lose seats in 2018.A MUST WIN 2 MAGA
Humility? How about compassion? Vote NO on this monstrosity of a bill .@SenMikeLee
Another missing ingredient?   Concern for the weakest among us.  There is more concern for the rich in this bill than the disabled.  #Parker
I was promised #FullRepeal for 7 yrs. I worked 2 elect repubs for 7 yrs. No repeal, no more GOP votes. Im done giving & not getting from GOP
Allowing companies to profit from healthcare ensures that people will never be able to afford what they need. Do like the rest of the world.
Don't use words like humility - it has no place in govt. or healthcare.
I UNDERSTAND I NEED HEALTHCARE NEITHER MEDICATE NOR MEDICARE WANT TO ASSIST ME. I AM DISABLE FOR LIFE. HOW CAN YOU ASSIST US TEXANS.
This thread:
In Portland, ME a 60-year old with middle income will pay $9,290 more ( 208%). Premiums will be 31% of income.

Ahhhh...but there's#California & #Illinois
@OpinionOnion7 @AppSame @LouDobbs @RandPaul @DailyMailUK
Do not vote YES>You will have Blood on your hands will be a murderer.The Rich will get richer.What will happen to poor people?VOTE NO!

The GOP wrote a bill in 5 weeks in secret that'll impact 1/6 of economy. They'll destroy health care for tax breaks. 
The missing ingredient for GOP primary for Utah Senate next time will be YOU! Support @realDonaldTrump and @SenateGOP and pass repeal now!
If you all had half a brain you would have just fixed ACA which has probs bur a lot better than this. I can see two senate seats flip !
In the End, Lee will vote for this TURD and your rates will skyrocket!
MORE $ for mental health & addiction, NOT LESS. It's costing America money to not help mentally ill. CRUEL TO TAKE AWAY TREATMENT
pLEASE DON'T RESURRECT AHC SOCIALIST TRTY FORCED ON US BY LEFT. WE ARE AMERICA, NOT COMMIES, WON'T BE COMMIES, THEY CAN LEAVE! JESUITS/VAT
#The400 $1,000,000,000,000 #TheRestOfUs $0
Remove State boundaries for insurance. Help Trump win a good bill. You can do it.Speak positive & convince other 4.
You can buy a cell phone for less than $100. Be bold and Let the free market do what it does best.
Stand firm, sir
Vote health bill.democrats want to impeach..hold onto your power..vote with Trump..
Missing ingredient: REPEAL !!!!
Thank you for making the hard but right choice for voting no on BCRA. I my ACA #healthcareforoeopkenotforprofit
Dear brother. Please repeal and replace Obama care. Tq
You've contributed nothing, Sen. Lee. Absolutely not a whit of constructive work. This is a tough question and you're simply a rock-thrower.
Go Mike!  And why aren't repubs embarrassed?  Just a little bit?  What on earth are they thinking?  Holy Batman  (No capitals intentionally)
So--if you don't get to opt out --then what? Utah lives out the collapse of Obamacare? Submit an amendment! Have pity on folks not in Utah
Get healthcare thru. You have had 7 yrs. compromise. You are an obstructionist just like dems. Do your job
Why not: 1) Let insurance go across states, & 2) make all health care costs tax deductible?
Mike Lee will fall in line and vote as told.  PARTY BEFORE COUNTRY. All smoke and mirrors hot air and BS
We'll see who chooses party over their promises. I hope Lee stands strong. Remember he never endorsed Trump.
mine in Arizona is going up 116 percent  ARE YOU GOING TO PAY IT?  OBAMACARE MUST GO... PLEASE STOP BEING AN OBAMA LOVER
Senator Mike Lee. Please vote "YES" for your Republic Heath Bill. Do you want to stay "Obama broken down Heath"?  You can always make better
, thank you for standing strong against the #bcra.  The people voted for #FullRepeal, not for modified, #Socialism #RinoCare
Support you four and are proud of you!  Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have to go along with John McCain!
Please vote no, Senator. You must show empathy and be on the right side of history. We're all watching.
Senator, why would any Republican be against choice and allowing states to be a competing laboratory of best (and even worst) practices?
Maybe true for most states, but Illinois will find a way to make it way worse than it already is!
So in order to win your vote on healthcare it must be perfect for you and your state. You are an obstructionist Lee! Utah=Trump haters
get involved. Vote yes on health bill.Then discuss.Please  cooperate with your  party.This  is when your seat really matters.
The huge premium increase for seniors (5 X's) is disastrous to seniors & will lose a lot of votes for the GOP.  Please change this feature.
Thank u for standing for us.#fullrepeal
People will die because of this bill.  You know it's a bad bill, yet you are going to vote for it anyway?

Mike Lee roasts the Senate health care bill before adding he could still probably end up voting for a version of it. https://medium.com/@SenMikeLee/the-missing-ingredient-in-bcra-humility-771ce270fd00 â€¦ 
You say that BCRA provides massive tax cuts and bailouts to billionaires & insurance companies. How would an opt-out fix that? Just vote NO.
remove NOT replace we the people do not want the govt to decide who gets care that is marxisim NAZI etc .... just remove it now
Thank you for your sanity and your standing up for what's left of what used to be the right.
Please do your best to protect the people, Senator Lee. Thank you so much for speaking out.
Why not resurrect HR3762 to @RepealObamaCare.It abolished Obamacare & @Defund_PP. Obama vetoed it 1/6/2016.
Yeah. That's it. It isnt mean enough. It won't hurt enough Americans. Shameful.
@tedcruz @RandPaul YOUR ALL 3 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF AMERICAN HISTORY ON THIS VOTE! WE WANT FREEDOM FROM THE OBAMA DEATHCARE BILL!
@tedcruz @RandPaul YOU 3 R THE SMARTEST MEN IN THE SENATE STAND YOUR GROUND &GIVE THEM SOME HELL! WE WANT REPEAL & FREE MARKETS!
@tedcruz @RandPaul THIS 4TH OF JULY STAND YOUR GROUND! TEACH WHY IT IS A NO VOTE! YOU CAN'T BUILD ON A SAND TRAP DEATHCARE BILL!
@tedcruz @RandPaul THE 4TH OF JULY IS ABOUT FREEDOM & WE THE PEOPLE ARE BEING PUSHED INTO SINGLE PAYER DEATHCARE #VOTE HELL NO!
Understand that healthcare is a big issue for us-fix it by learning our stories
Please apply this to your unwillingness to humble yourself and actually listen to those of us who have left the GOP
Getting the government to give up power is like getting rid of base line budgeting. Will elites still be exempt? So disingenuous
The problem is that now almost our entire party has bought into the idea that government has a place in healthcare.
Don't vote for it!
#FullRepeal
You & rest of the RINOS r the problem w/conservative party.
If you were truly the party of fiscal conservatism you'd be passing #MedicareForAll and saving taxpayer $$ by cutting out the middleman.
Humility?!? I think the word you're looking for is HUMANITY.
