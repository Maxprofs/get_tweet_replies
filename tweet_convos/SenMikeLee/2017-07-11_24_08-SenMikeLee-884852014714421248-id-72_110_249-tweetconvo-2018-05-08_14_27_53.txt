You are really giving Americans the choice to "opt out" of coverage? This is double- talk. You were sent to D.C. to improve life in the US
Actually, they were sent to D.C. to defend the constitution. Doing a fine job at that as well, right?
"promote the general welfare" is defending the constitution.
Politicians today are going as far as saying the Constitution is NOT the Supreme law of the land. That's defending the Constitution??? NOT!
waiting....
Both Cruz and yourself need a side of reality. Maybe others will join you in the test. You believe in the market, well this is your test.
Then the conservative way neglects & discards my sick pregnant patients and their high risk babies. - A Utah Doctor @MySMFM
Incredibly, you actually think we're this uninformed about our healthcare. Incredibly, that's how uninformed you are. #DontInsultMe 84106
Sick patients don't have the luxury of being Consumers. Health care is not a market. Signed, a Real Doctor.
Healthcare is not a market??? WTF do you think all of those INSURANCE COMPANIES are out there for??? Looks??? Shop around and get some!
The average Trump voter has to be furious at this point as they see the Republicans make complete FOOLS of themselves.  Amazing failure!
It's not #FullRepeal, which is what we were promised. Please do not fold on your commitment to fully get rid of the ACA. #UnitedForFreedom.
You're a liar. Increase health care quality? Seriously? That BS you're proposing? Yeah, you're a LIAR. Just admit it.
Just REPEAL this BS and move on. Not your authority anyhow!
Halfway repeal doesn't work, all or nothing !
WRONG. Sick people mostly can't work to generate the extra charge in premiums. The Healthy PAY FOR THE SICKâ€” kindness, remember that?
Kindness yes...but do not force the "nice" working people to pay for it...kindness=donation
Steal from the poor and infirmed to give tax-cuts to R's wealthy donors. It has always been about getting money to the rich, and you know it
Not so,  not all congressmen are on the take.  Cruz and Lee are good men.  I am thankful that they are in congress
Do you count on Medicaid for survival? My guess is no.  So you don't consider it important.
You and Cruz need to drop your Congress healthcare and buy your policies on the open market and report back to us in two years.
After 25 years in health insurance & another 10 fighting WF&A "on behalf" of for-profit insurers, you can't fool me, Senator. #Whistleblower
Where r u on WH connections to Russia? NO security clearance for Jared and Ivanka.. Enough!!!
Love Cruz and Lee!  Keep up the good. Work
And for Gods sake! Quit using big words you don't understand... like FREEDOM! We'd have freedom if you guys would quit Effin it up!
"Consumer Freedom? We haven't had consumer freedom 4 decades. Govt keeps letting companies create monopolies & duopolies. Freedom is gone.
Repeal Obamacare fully. That is the #1 reason the GOP got control of all levels of govt. Now do the damn job.
Thank you for trying Senator. The Progressive Statists won't accept this option, so I hope that you side with the 10th Amendment instead.
and vote for Full Repeal only
The conservative way is 2get r lousy elitist entitled class heck out of r lives Go w  @RandPaul plan, not a fan, but this time he is right
Think ted could get it done ,doubt many others care about anything except their checks!!!
lower premiums
and lower deductibles
and cover pre existing conditions.
right? mike?
It segregates the insurance market which will lead to significant adverse selection.
I'm for it! Do not back down on this!
Loud Mike just says meaningless stuff because he doesn't know much about this issue at all.
This is why government should stay out of this. The dummies don't understand what insurance is.
If you just want healthcare to be for the well-to-do, say so. Come out and say "survival of the fittest." That's what your plan is.
Inhumane
And it has been shown over history that the "conservative" approach fails.
There's so much double speak and spin in that slam piece... I don't even
The logic of it fails on assumed market forces that do not accurately describe the needs of healthcare.
Come on.  You don't really believe this, do ya Mike?
Killing elderly and children ?
From what I understand, this would be harmful to many with preexisting conditions, Senator Lee.
Free market choice, competition, incentives, etc.  All work. Forced control and compliance died when we won at Yorktown
Ok only if folks buying junk or limited plans sign a waver they won't ask for public help when they can't afford to buy that life saving med
Only if "conservative" means the idea that only rich people deserve health care.
Yeah sure. Black is white and up is down. Not buying your b.s.
Repeal this Obamacare POS, do what you promised. REPEAL. Govt doesn't have any power over this. U know as a Constitution supporter.
Rephrase the debate by calling all gov programs guarantees  people see through that crap
What about trump? Use your voice. You're silence promotes his illegal, dark, desperate, deplorable agenda. This is not normal
Parker is currently inpatient in rm 3071 of @primarychildren   Where do medically complex children fit in your healthcare philosophy? #utpol
Good luck Parker and Tammy. Hopefully, they can see reason, and Parker.
I'm not Morman but not to admire how they support the disadvantaged in their " family" is missing the generosity
Comm rating is SO horrible that it's what every employer ins plan provides. Are you suggesting changing emp ins? #bcra nonsense #utpol
The truth of the matter is you simply don't care about the poor, sick and elderly. Every man for himself!
Do you have some proof of that?
Sorry, it's not a right. It's a responsibility.
Let's  do  it.
And ruin people with pre existing conditions lives... But then again probably a reason you like it.
If Senators can't agree on a plan, at the very least, repeal the ACA. Then work on a new market based plan that works for America.
You guys are the real death panels.
Why don't you concentrate on your communist President Trump instead of wasting your time and screwing up healthcare even further
Hahahahahaha 
Cannot seriously believe you're supporting this. Shameful.
The pathetic leader of your caucus, @SenMajLdr, wants high premiums and inferior quality, government-run health care.  #FullRepeal
Cruz? You're supporting something Cruz came up with? I guarantee there's something in it that will cost us more money/provide less than ACA.
It's  called  personal  responsibility.  Pay your own way....
REPEAL OC completely! Have a TIME LIMIT on those with Pre-existing conditions to get on Medicaid! Open selling insurance across stateliness!
Those who are working would once again be able to afford insurance IF the Free market were given a chance to work again! Economics 101!
don't trust Cruz with a 10 foot pole - you need to do some pondering, fasting, and praying about how to truly help America
But how about those Donald Trump Jr e-mails, right??
