@SenMikeLee @MegaDriver86 There may be a few people that agree w/you but they are the minority. The fraying fringe on the right.
@ladybigmac @SenMikeLee Ruth DO NOT speak for me...I am an American & this is not over & there is less of a minority than U think
@monroemk Then YOU should not speak for ME. Besides, we voted in 2012 and the Dems. won. Tell @SenMikeLee to check the papers.
@ladybigmac @SenMikeLee Ruth Have a nice life under the Hitler regime & explain 2 my cancer pt's why they can no longer afford their ins !!!
@monroemk @Libertyguy72 @ladybigmac @SenMikeLee Ruth is still one of the people who believes it is all about dems and repubs.
@mefbama and you believe it's about....? Though I do agree,  O is mod repub in views/laws. We'd do better with more liberal president
@gusnlea The country and it's debt. If people can not get past their divide of blue vs red, north vs south mentality we will all lose.
@mefbama agreed to some extent. Debt has been rising out of control since Reagan, except Clinton. We need to reinstate higher tax rates.
@SenMikeLee You can't let the American people down any more than you already have.
@apple_butter Yeah, ignorance always scares me.    But what are you gonna do?
@apple_butter Hmmmm.  You felt the need to inflict your dipshittery on me.
@apple_butter You seem kind.  And sweet deep down.
@SenMikeLee And it IS over.    You lost.
@Crutnacker @SenMikeLee Real mature! And if it is over, we have all lost.
@thebigjman57 @SenMikeLee Tonight we true patriots tasted victory against the tyranny of the uneducated tea party!   USA! USA! USA!

What are you GOP "guys" doing to keep Obama from forcing a Single Payer System?  Can he Exec Order it?
@JOEROWE409 If Exempt Est Actually Opposed Obamacare,it wouldn't have Attacked Cruz & Lee http://bit.ly/1cLmTfP  *Single-payer or bail outs
the law needs to be repealed it will never work ..everyone will be on medicaid @SenMikeLee @Rowanes
In one form or another thats the quality we will wind up with @ultraconcept @SenMikeLee @Rowanes

You made the #gop look like idiots --->@SenMikeLee. You and @SenTedCruz should be ashamed. No plan but personal aggrandizement.
The plan was to remove the smoke-n-mirrors of ACA. Shine light on it and let us as Americans see its-@RBruceMorgan @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee @MegaDriver86 I am an American "people" and I totally don't agree w/what you are doing. So don't say "American people".

@gusnlea I did not ask for my tweet to be forwarded. Others may do that w/o my knowledge.
@ladybigmac again, directed at John. Since you blocked him, you can't see his childish reply asking some1to fwd his tweet so u would see it
@SenMikeLee @wattsjim Thank you Sen. Lee. We will keep you in our prayers.
@SenMikeLee @afezio1952 @SenTedCruz I'm looking at news ratings,  the lies told by the big 3, reach 10x more than all cable.  Need media
@SenMikeLee @afezio1952 @SenTedCruz 16 x more people see big 3 for news than fox.  That doesn't count CNN, MSNBC
@SenMikeLee @chipwoods why would you let a bill pass that gives debt ceiling decision to POTUS?
@SenMikeLee @chipwoods Not winning the battle is not as important as winning the war. Thousands,especially victims of OC are asking,why?
@SenMikeLee @LeahR77 I'm behind you and hope a lot more Americans are. Thank you for standing up
@Cterry18Terry @SenMikeLee Same here, Mr Lee you have our respect & support. We hunger for real leadership!!

@SenMikeLee @BlackIrishI Was always against the idea of 3rd party. But I think it is time. You, Rand or Ted could win with only 40% or less.
Keep the pressure on @SenMikeLee the leftists attack means the message is getting through. The unaffordable care act will crush itself!
@SenMikeLee @pljulia50 Senator, focus on the debt crisis.  You all have kicked that can down the road too many times.

@SenMikeLee @dchris4089 A more concise & concerted plan is necessary. Must follow Reagan's rules & stick together.MUST! Or face destruction.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Please don't give up! I'm so disappointed in Congress, especially @OrrinHatch. Utah deserves better.
@HeyRonWilson @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I'm so disgusted I ever pulled the lever for @OrrinHatch #disappointed #termlimits
@ccritchfield @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @OrrinHatch Me, too. I should have known better! I do now.

@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce If ACA won't tank our economy, amnesty will. It's The Organizer's plan.
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator! we need to educate the pub about Socialism/Comm. How can I help?
