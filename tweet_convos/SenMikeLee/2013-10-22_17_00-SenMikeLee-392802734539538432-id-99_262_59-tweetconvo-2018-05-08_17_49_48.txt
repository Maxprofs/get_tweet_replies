@SSNjl @Pudingtane @SenMikeLee @georgewill According to what I heard at today's hearing....need to start all
Over! #Clustercare
Of course. The whole idea of completely reinventing the USA HC system was totally wrong thing 2 do @MJBodary @SSNjl @SenMikeLee @georgewill
@Pudingtane
@SenMikeLee @Pudingtane It's time to back up and let the law kill itself. Savage says, "give Obamacare a chance". It'll die a natural death!
@SenMikeLee if you can't hire tec firm to build it the whole thing is flawed
NO BILL should be more then 2 pages
@SenMikeLee @whuggins Do not resuscitate. Let it die. If GOP try & save damn thing just cause they like parts of it they need an a$$ whoopin
.@PatroitStrong61 @SenMikeLee Therefore, keep friends & loved ones close... and your enemies closer. You'll know what to do when time comes.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz   Why is Spanish website that IS ready deliberately being kept off per hearing? 
#pjnet #tcot #ORPUW
@SenMikeLee @prfekrdumbrella  Mike, "We the People" ACA is Unconstitutional since Liar in Thief unilaterally gave out exemptions. Repeal
@SenMikeLee @prfekrdumbrella senator, he wants single payer.
@SenMikeLee @prfekrdumbrella The entire law is broken! If they can't manage a website how the hell r they going to manage healthcare!
@SenMikeLee @Texastweetybird Well, the entire law is 1.unread 2. unconstitutional 3. tyrannical and 4.evil - so yeah, I'd call it broken.
@SenMikeLee @FreedomS00 "Losing faith". my first question, which Americans started October WITH faith n #Obamacare?
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 well, isn't it?  Wink wink!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 It's such a small part of the entire administration of the law and it's an indicator of how bad it'll be.
@SenMikeLee Thank God  Mike Lee Ted Cruz stood up against obamacare ..thumbs down on  rinos Sen  ayotte, rubio,McConell,cornyn,corker
@SenMikeLee "The best way to get a bad law repealed is to enforce it strictly." Abraham Lincoln
Dumb @SenMikeLee The Law and the Website has no correlation if that is the case then it is true All ppl who reside in Utah are Mormons
@SenMikeLee @LoriLandRich this is so ridiculous you have six months to sign up.why not wait till the law is implemented?
@SenMikeLee If it were only tech problems, ok, that ain't the problem, pay more, bigger deductible, less coverage & NO privacy = problems
@SenMikeLee  IF @SenatorShaheen @SenMarkPryor @SenLandrieu @SenatorBegich @Sen_JoeManchin Voted With U No Shutdown
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz True.Now some Dems agree w' conservative idea to delay indv. mandate.They delay to save law instead make OC extinct!
@SenMikeLee Do U know a what bothers  #UTGOP ? @UtahGOPBlogger @HollyontheHill  Delegates 
 @SenMikeLee & Established $$$ (R) hate Caucus
@SenMikeLee So which awesome law do you propose to replace it? Tort reform and sending uninsured people to the emergency room won't cut it.
@SenMikeLee Only the #ignorant people....oh, yeah, like your #TeaParty devotees. Most of us know you are working against American people!
.@SenMikeLee #ButWaitTheresMore Many more believe you are a horse's ass who is not qualified to serve in Congress. Please proceed.
@SenMikeLee That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard, that's like saying I had a flat tire so I need a new car,come on people, REALLY
@SenMikeLee keep fighting for us the american people!! We need you. You have awakened so many people to what going on in DC. Thank you
@SenMikeLee @Jim_Peoples_ Not "Broken"-Was never, ever designed 2 work. Gosh, won't work so, let's see, Single-Payer sounds good.
.@SenMikeLee Why are so many military leaders being fired? http://benswann.com/9-generals-fired-2-military-leaders-suspended/#ixzz2iZcHJZIf … & Plz don't forget we need answers for #Benghazi B4 2016.
.@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul Thank you for standing up for the Constitution & #WeThePpl. You are appreciated. #tcot
@LillyIsFree @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul for all the bad talk about them they sure are looking good
@SenMikeLee  #obamacareisadisease
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 Don't let the Dems impose (foist) their single payer socialist plan on us!!
@SenMikeLee Why worry about ACA? Your reign is coming to an end. Let me be the first to say BYE and #shut the door behind you!
@SenMikeLee think it's time to give it up and work on fixing America's problems instead of beating a dead horse?  Would be a nice change.
@SenMikeLee 2000 page law ...20000 pages of regulations .. govt designing an insurance web site ....gee, what could go wrong :-)
@SenMikeLee Need to investigate #CGI contracts-9BILL DHS and ties to NSA PRISM platform. No limit on data mining for int'l companies.
@SenMikeLee that's not what the article says. the word "indicate" is wrong.
@SenMikeLee  As Obama nears the end of his 5th year in office, his toughest job is dreaming up new excuses for his mounting failures.
@SenMikeLee God works in mysterious way! 
@SenMikeLee #ButWaitTheresMore #Obamacare THANKYOU Mike LEE if we had just a few more Reps like you to take a real stand in DC we could win.
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin Obamacare punishes hospitals providing care to un-insured The Daily Caller http://dailycaller.com/2013/08/08/obamacare-installs-new-scrutiny-fines-for-charitable-hospitals-that-treat-uninsured-people/ …
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin No crises in confidence. No confidence to begin with. #PresidentStompyFoot #spitehouse
@SenMikeLee If a thinking person will visit http://www.hhs.gov  and read some of the 'law' they, too, will realize it must be stopped.
@SenMikeLee @CAPTDSPAWN5  I want to know why it cost so much!
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty send us a solution NOW TALK ABOUT #truth
@SenMikeLee yes agree and i feel this has never be about the law but him wanting the countries personal info
@SenMikeLee The problem with Obamacare is not the website but that its socialism. Stealing the rights of American citizens
@SenMikeLee @middlemom don't let the impotent RINOs in the Utah GOP get your goat. When Obamacare come crashing down you'll he a hero.
@SenMikeLee It does no good to repeal this. It's being hung from the rafters by its own iniquities. Sit tight-they'll hang with it.
@SenMikeLee In 2 yes when this fiasco has crashed and burned all anyone will remember is 18 senators defied the establishment and said No.
.@SenMikeLee The Affordable Care Act is well on its way to covering millions of Americans who had been shut out of the system.
.@SenMikeLee Keep REAFFIRMING all the amazing benefits people are already discovering through the http://Healthcare.gov  website.
.@SenMikeLee The Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act is helping thousands of parents insure their previously uninsurable children.
.@SenMikeLee The Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act is already helping hundreds of thousands to find previously unaffordable coverage.
.@SenMikeLee And you used RW pejorative for the Affordable Care Act. People who hate O-Care, like the ACA, so let's call it that.
.@SenMikeLee You didn't intend it but you just blasted a RW talking point, reinforcing it as true. Best to restate. http://www.winningwordsproject.com/rule_1_when_responding_to_right_wing_lies_and_talking_points …
@SenMikeLee most Americans never had faith in this disaster. Continue to fight on repealing Obama care.
@SenMikeLee "Many believe technical problems plaguing #Obamacare website indicate the entire law is broken"

They're called stupid people!
@SenMikeLee #obamacarefailure is inevitable, as the young healthy enrollees needed to make it work, will end up paying a fine w/ no coverage
@SenMikeLee the website is bad, not the product. What! Are you worried that it;s going to work and everybody will see that you're a liar?
@SenMikeLee 
This was a $500 million scam, plain and simple. now how much more will it cost?
@SenMikeLee https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=597870896937064&set=a.542268289163992.1073741829.542219879168833&type=1&theater …
@SenMikeLee Bullseye. Exactly. Entire law is unAmerican
@SenMikeLee Don't do Obama's dirty work for him.. let him ask for the delay.
@SenMikeLee SHOWUS FROM PLAN #FIREJOHNMCCAIN #FIREHARRYREID
@SenMikeLee losing faith we never had faith and never wanted it
@SenMikeLee cause it is!!!
@SenMikeLee I don't mind paying more in state & local taxes Why when I bust ass to make 2k biweekly does Uncle Sam think he deserves $500.00
@SenMikeLee clearly it is
@SenMikeLee Can we work on defunding the federal government? I do not think the federal government deserves 25% of my pay.
@SenMikeLee if Obama had broken do many laws..why can't he be impeached? Why isn't anybody getting him out of office?
@SenMikeLee #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee What glitches will doctors face when they start filing claims?
@SenMikeLee As in a relationship where 2 people have never gotten along, it's having all of this trouble because it was "not meant to be."
@SenMikeLee A responsible person would point out that is an illogically leap and incorrect inference. Unfortunately u r not responsible
@SenMikeLee  " We the People" agreed, incidentally Steny H wants more money for glitch repair - tell him to take the "pork" spending.
@SenMikeLee certainly does. That's what happens when you hire an amateur to do the job of an executive!
@SenMikeLee Many believe correctly that with people like you & Cruz the entire Tea Party is broken.
@SenMikeLee @bartmckinley #Obamacare has been broken from day 1!
@SenMikeLee // Dems have to fix the website so we can find out what's in the website...
@SenMikeLee people wake up! Socialism just around corner
@SenMikeLee The tax that is #Obamacare  was broke on arrival.  Congress shall enact no law that is not binding on the Congress. Needs fixing
@SenMikeLee ...and they would be wrong, as are your lies, oops! I mean "talking points", but facts don't change those, right?
@SenMikeLee Argumentum ad absurdum.
@SenMikeLee What we really need is to see it up and running properly, and see how much, if any, is worth keeping and/or tweeking.
@SenMikeLee what was the cost of the website?
@SenMikeLee Cool story bro. So what're you guys gonna do about it?
@SenMikeLee It does. #tcot
