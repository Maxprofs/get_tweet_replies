@SenMikeLee Senator, it's here. It's been legislated, judicified, and popular-voted. Instead of squabbling to no end, let's make it work.
@Jeremy_LaMont @SenMikeLee No, they didn't read the bill. It hurts my family and many others. Obama lied. People CANT keep what they have.
@ignorancecosts @SenMikeLee I heard something about that yesterday. People getting cancellation notices through plan change, I think? Bad!
@Jeremy_LaMont @SenMikeLee Necessary. The old plans didn't cover maternity & gov mandates.
@ignorancecosts @SenMikeLee So what's the process for those things to be picked back up? Is there a big delay or lack of coverage period?
@Jeremy_LaMont @SenMikeLee New policy. More expensive. Of course, because costs have to be spread out among everyone.
@ignorancecosts @SenMikeLee The costs are already spread out among everyone for non-paying care though. This just formalizes it. Right?
@Jeremy_LaMont @SenMikeLee For people who had insurance. Their choice. Could have set up fund 4 the FEW people w no access.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce I think he DOES know this.
@SenMikeLee @RealNewsBlazeTV Obamacare is unconstitutional and I will not be forced to sign up for it. And everyone's premiums will go up.
@SenMikeLee That's because Obama is living the high-life in the DC bubble. He needs to be impeached for crimes against America!
@SenMikeLee Only those of us paying the bills for the Royalty in DC. They care  about themselves. I hope they are accountable in my lifetime
@SenMikeLee @lucille_moss Again the difference between business & an idea.  In business we see a loser & cut our losses in Govt keep going.
@SenMikeLee @jimLinduff Oh, he knows!
@Twisty58 @SenMikeLee yes he does Tammy. Thats undeniable.
@jimLinduff @SenMikeLee the whole thing is insane
@Twisty58 @SenMikeLee I totally agree. Kabuki theater of the highest order.
@jimLinduff @SenMikeLee Ha! Precisely!
@SenMikeLee @lucille_moss All part of his plan to fundamentally damage America and turn us into a 3rd world country.
@SenMikeLee @TRUCKER4AMERICA because he sees it as another POWER GRAB & more control over the minions.
@SenMikeLee @labelladiva He knows it but does not care! He has his own agenda to destroy our nation.
@sunflower1790 @SenMikeLee I honestly believe that his agenda is to destroy our nation . . . for what reason I have not figured out yet.
@labelladiva @SenMikeLee You are 100% correct! He is NOT an American, he was raised to HATE America!!!
@SenMikeLee @mjselker he wants it to be terrible? He wants to bring America down to 3rd world level because he's anti-American!
@SenMikeLee @mjselker we need more ppl in Congress like u & Ted Cruz who R fighting for the American ppl
@BigDaddyCool724 @mjselker @SenMikeLee   Amen!
.@SenMikeLee .@vmpcott Yes, it will be terrible. But you must consider this is what Obama *WANTS*. Our congress is allowing an enemy within!
@SenMikeLee "everyone" who? Seriously, @BarackObama ran on HEALTHCARE REFORM and won. So, again, WHO is the ACA hurting?
@SenMikeLee @RealNewsBlazeTV #Obamacare those in favor aren't affected, so don't care #rulingclass
@SenMikeLee Obama is as smart as a box of rocks
@SenMikeLee @__DragonWings__ Don't be fooled.  He knows it's bad, he planned it.  Aim is to lead to single payer system Socialized Medicine!
@SenMikeLee @bloodless_coup The truth is #Obamadontcare
@SenMikeLee ...a President who refuses to protect all Americans, including unborn Americans, is clearly not the "kind" of President we need.
@SenMikeLee Yes, Senator,Obamacare w/b terrible 4 us ...but isn't that the plan???
There may be a few democrat hold outs that are still carrying Obama's water. @SenMikeLee @labelladiva
@jwsnyder00_john @SenMikeLee Hopefully the masses will protest when they realize the cost out of their pockets and vote them out!
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce We do, continue the  good fight.  RINO's must go. Time 4 conservatives & libertarians to take off the gloves.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce WH web site states ACA will save Middle Class $$$. But O's eliminating that entire portion of populace!
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce I could support OCare if it included a cure for Stupid.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Very clear that @BarackObama lives in alternate universe. But he claims to understand #constitution, so. #obvious
@SenMikeLee @DonnaBanister General Mike Lee,Semper Fi!
@SenMikeLee Pay attention "universal healthcare is the keystone to controlling the masses". Obama knows exactly how bad Obama care is. #tcot
@SenMikeLee -the Pres. recognized,  he just doesn't care.  Remember- "Fundamentaly Transform the country" YEP!  HE'S DOING IT!
@SenMikeLee No. He recognizes...and approves heartily! POTUS=Enemy of the #Constitution. Jury's still out whether foreign or domestic
@SenMikeLee @AndrewLuck23 And @kirstenpowers10 also fails to recognize that Ocare will be terrible for Americans @brithume @oreillyfactor
@SenMikeLee Thats just what Obama wants, DIVIDE AND CONCKER
@Ladyred133 @SenMikeLee Right..its part of Obama following the Cloward-Piven Plan to take America down, then resurrect as socialist
@SenMikeLee @RushetteNY He realizes it. It's all by design. Read the Cloward-Piven strategy and you will understand. Happens when not vetted
Fascinating glimpse at Sargent Shriver's contribution to Cloward-Piven  read "Sarge".......@joshualionel @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee OBCare is making a nation of part time works, have to work 2 jobs & still no insurance! What the HELL is going on! WAKE UP!
@SenMikeLee  it's designed that way! It's just the path to single payer system . It's no big secret.
@SenMikeLee keep up the good work Mike.
@SenMikeLee "Almost everyone" in Congress doesn't seem to care "that #Obamacare is going to be terrible for the American people"
@SenMikeLee @AmyKremer - that's the big lie of America's Nazi Party.
@SenMikeLee he knows exactly what hes doing why do u think hes been going to places that are ran by dictators daaaw
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek he recognizes it alright thts y he was makn sure it went thru even 2the point of default O has got nothin but contempt
@SenMikeLee @RobForshey he realises vwell an indoctrinated progressive bent on humbling our nation"fastest way2socialism is thru medicine"RR
.@SenMikeLee @deanmeek TY so much 4 ur courage. It's worse than a bad law; it's designed 2 destroy US. Privacy: gone Cost: prohibitive.
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek Yet more than enough R going along w/B0 inflicting it on us, but not themselves. Now we know what they think of us.
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek and that's because his nose is so far up Soros and jarretts butts
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek No, I think the president realizes just fine that Obamacare will be terrible for the people.
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek and none are acting on stopping it.
@SenMikeLee @deanmeek Oh, he knows!
@SenMikeLee @DecisionZero There will be BIG political price for that. FOX poll - not raise Debt Limit 58-37 - American people on YOUR side!!
@SenMikeLee This word, "almost".  I do not think you know what it means.
@SenMikeLee @RealNewsBlazeTV  I am donating to http://FreedomWorks.org .  Sen. Lee real Americans will continue to stand beside you. Thank you
@SenMikeLee and then you went and made it more popular. I despise you for that. #MakeDCListen #GOPSurrenderSongs #GOPplaylist
@SenMikeLee then don't sign up. Oh, I forgot. You don't need health care. You have your own sweet plan.
@SenMikeLee thank you for being a good man, we have your back :) xo @PeteNicodemus
@SenMikeLee @PeteNicodemus
Remember it's about control,  not easing our existence.  Look at the exemptions
Dude, step away from the echo chamber! @senmikelee
@SenMikeLee You threw the American people under the bus to look good
@SenMikeLee Then why hell did you let it pass?
@SenMikeLee @The2ndguardsUS Will be great for those who get subsidies, will be terrible for those who don't get subsidies.
@SenMikeLee @RealNewsBlazeTV thanks for your character and courage in the face of the tyrants who stand against us all
@SenMikeLee He recognizes it. He doesn't care because it's intended to be terrible before it crashes and burns.
@SenMikeLee @BarbieHitsBack Obama knows, he does not care he wants to take America down a very bad path.
@wakeupbeheard @SenMikeLee Like the President & his family I too don't want Obamacare..Mr President #EatYourOwnDogFood STOP forcing it on me
@SenMikeLee Obama believes if he repeats something enough, people will believe it to be truth. He's good at propaganda. That's not a virtue.
@SenMikeLee this is worth watching
@SenMikeLee @drscott_atlanta #obama knows it and he did it on purpose to destroy America because he is a #muslem mole in Washington
@SenMikeLee Apparently 81 Senators don't realize how horrible it's going to be, thank you for being a voice for The People
@SenMikeLee He knows it, he taught Saul Alinsky.  The road to single payer goes through the town of misery.
@senmikelee @thorntonb1 Almost everyone but Boehner & McConnell & all other RINO's I guess $5B will buy anyone anytime. $3B Ohio $2B KY
@SenMikeLee @hiattchiatt That would be SEN Lee, sorry :)
@SenMikeLee @hiattchiatt Mr. Lee, as a software person, I can tell you the rollout alone was telling. Very poorly done, just like the law
@SenMikeLee Not "everyone". I'm one of your constituents that supports the ACA. There's a lot more like me. Take your head out of the sand.
@SenMikeLee @ThorntonB1
ACA INOP Website a Dem Strategy
To Protect Dem Incumbents
Website will Miraculously Work 1 Day after 
11/5 Election
@andscan  This you know, or are you speculating?
@ThorntonB1 speculating based on Dems 2012 Strategies,,IRS Attacks on Active Conservatives,  Benghazi Blame it on the Video Act
@SenMikeLee They will find out come election day
@SenMikeLee That's why Obama, Dems, Congress & their staffers made sure to exempt selfs from #ObamaScare Do as I say not as I do DEMOCRATS
@SenMikeLee   why hasn't this  illegal resident been arrested for treason yet? What is it going to take to stop this communistic admin?
@SenMikeLee by almost everybody do U mean everybody that cannot comprehend PEW and Gallup polls? #ObamaCareSavingLives
@SenMikeLee @EnragedinCO it is as he planned, he wants us to suffer. He is in power and that is intoxicating.
@SenMikeLee #Obamacare = #Fail Time to re-write or start over.
@SenMikeLee I dislike Obummer as much as anyone .... But my premium is going down 30% for coverage comparable to what I have now.  Explain.
@SenMikeLee @EnragedinCO Cue: http://sharlaslabyrinth.blogspot.com/2012/12/john-boehner-leads-republicans-into.html …  http://sharlaslabyrinth.blogspot.com/2013/10/oath-keepers-just-as-we-warned-china_16.html … @SpeakerBoehner
@SenMikeLee really? Again polls show 48% of people like ACA and 18% of the people who don't want single payor. Some facts are inconvenient
@SenMikeLee Obama knows Ocare is bad, that's why he wants an exemption.
Doesn't appear your fellow elected representatives do either.@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee He knows but he is after a large structure for the country which banishes democracy.
@SenMikeLee yep, that's why Romney won. Oh wait, he didn't. a small percentage of rural Utahns does not equal "almost everyone".
@senmikelee @resisttyranny you and TP lost. GOP receive nothing, but cost America $23 billion dollar for this fight. You a fisal hawk right.
@SenMikeLee  We are feeling the birth pangs. End Times.
@SenMikeLee @RealNewsBlazeTV you mean Obama and everyone who just voted for the Congress to be irrelevant.
@SenMikeLee as long as it enslaves the people and keeps them dependent on govt. it works for Obama...fight on senator and thank you.
@SenMikeLee why is obama getting by with this stuff?  WHY!?!?!?
@SenMikeLee What bubble are you living in where "everyone" thinks ACA is terrible? Who are the interests you're really fighting for?
@SenMikeLee more bullshit propaganda out of your mouth.
@SenMikeLee @nevergiveup_kgs oh, he knows. He just doesn't care. Why should he, we pay for the best care for him #hypocrite
@SenMikeLee he doesn't care
@SenMikeLee Obamacare approval has increased since your debacle and is more popular than GOP. Ponder that.
@SenMikeLee  well it gives him more money to spend. He is an addict! Addicted to spending. Collecting that fine and spend more money!
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler we r gna be terrible for Obama come next November
@SenMikeLee He knows it, or there would be no mandate.  He just does not care.
@SenMikeLee We the people are behind you Mike. Fight on for is. 2014 is right around the corner.  Its time for a change in the Senate
@SenMikeLee oh, and Congress.
@SenMikeLee   u and Calgary cruz  wuzed
out u could have defunded Obamacare
@SenMikeLee Please. Don't think for a moment BHO doesn't know. That's the plan. @@
@SenMikeLee Except the AZ Senators! Im sorry they did not represent the wishes of AZ & rally behind you. Cowards.
@SenMikeLee Remember the Alamo Mike, agnst all odds, a few stood for freedom as you 18 did! You are Heroes to the Republic!
@SenMikeLee shorter O tonite- you can't stop us, point made, next amnesty.  Not one Dem said  good for our country, all good for govt
@SenMikeLee Obviously, BHO considers Americans having 'affordable healthcare' as his legacy-so you'd think he'd WANT SOMETHING THAT WORKS...
@SenMikeLee @drscott_atlanta I can't believe you and your cohorts in DC think he cares what the American people think.
@SenMikeLee then why is the Repub party not united on this? Why the spinelessness?  Fix the party before O divides and conquers all of us
@SenMikeLee Not Everyone, it appears many members of the HOUSE GOP think it's ok...
:(
@SenMikeLee Thats because Obama's head is so far up his ass he cant see daylight or hear anyone except the Muslim Brotherhood #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee He knows, he just doesn't care
@SenMikeLee God bless you Mike. Stay strong!
@SenMikeLee The president and some of your fellow senators who voted yes or just plain sold out.
@SenMikeLee we must not give up or give in!!  Third party!
@SenMikeLee its a sad day
@SenMikeLee It's not that he doesn't recognize it. He just doesn't care about anything but his own egomaniacal agenda.
@MissJitter @easyhandoff @SenMikeLee He is a in love with himself. He hates America and her values.
@SenMikeLee It's intended to poison the American ideal, not help people. That's the real scandal here.
@SenMikeLee @billpostmus Yeah, he and all his kool-aid drinking lieftist-socialists! My God, what has happend to America????
@SenMikeLee I know a few RINOs that must agree with the Pres.
What say U @MarkUdall? @SenMikeLee:Almost every1 but the president seems to recognize that #Obamacare is going to be terrible for Americans
@SenMikeLee 
Keep up the fight, stop obamacare!
@SenMikeLee Almost everyone but you seems to recognize that you are already terrible for the American people. (there, fixed it for you.)
@SenMikeLee BS...not even most in your own party would back your case leading up to this Epic Failure.
@SenMikeLee Are you 100% sure ACA is terrible for all Americans? I want to tell you it's not terrible for my family. More Teabag lies?
@SenMikeLee #Obama knows it will be terrible for #AmericanPeople but he doesn't care. As long as his goals are met he doesn't care.
@SenMikeLee @miaconserv2 Part of his plan to fundamentally change America. Bit by Bit.
@SenMikeLee You get NOTHING! You LOSE! good DAY sir!
@SenMikeLee Not as terrible as you are for the American people.
@SenMikeLee Jeremy how can the popular vote? Like a commercial that says this can of corn is the best ever. Only to find it taste like shit.
@SenMikeLee Obamacare will self implode....
@SenMikeLee @billpostmus  He knows it's bad for America.  He just doesn't care.
@SenMikeLee no thats where you wrong he knows exacly what it will do
@SenMikeLee good luck with that @Jeremy_LaMont
@SenMikeLee The deal that was fixed today reminds me of the evolution of the jack o lantern. See at http://history.com 
@SenMikeLee @BarackObama KNOWS the destruction of Obamacare on American people.
@SenMikeLee Ocare is doing EXACTLY what it was designed to do.....total collapse and Boehner/McConnell will fast forward it.  O is smiling
@SenMikeLee I am thoroughly convinced fiscal enslavement is his goal and Obamacare is the vehicle.
@SenMikeLee @ConnieJayRN Never assume #PresidentStompyFoot gives a damn, Senator. Obvious he.does not. Stand firm.
@SenMikeLee Stop economic terrorism , . You are the problem ad should resign if you can't bide by the economic process. Retired Army Vet
@SenMikeLee He knows exactly what he is doing. All part of his socialist agenda.  Dictator & his Dictatorettes must go.
@SenMikeLee I think he recognizes it... and likes the idea.
@SenMikeLee @ResistTyranny Try referring to it as The affordable care act acceptance comes through respect. You might just like it.
@SenMikeLee while I thank you and @SenTedCruz for what you are doing, please tell me that you both see where Obama is headed with this...
@SenMikeLee Call our show 877-297-8022
@SenMikeLee  please focus on the debt and entitlements
@SenMikeLee @RealNewsBlazeTV  The only people that support ObamaCare are the people who feed off of the hard working people of America.
@SenMikeLee Senator, thank you for standing up to # we the people. Gid bless you and your colleagues that stood with you.
@SenMikeLee Senator, he wants it to be awful. He's the man who cut veterans and survivor benefits.  He argued AGAINST the IL Born Alive bill
@SenMikeLee Learn your job, Health of Society is one of your highest priority. The new health care sstem is better than the old
@SenMikeLee Today will go down as one of the darkest days in American history and politics. Future generations will feel this fact.
@SenMikeLee Everyone agrees with you. That's why GOP lost seats in both chambers and President was reelected.
@SenMikeLee @ResistTyranny Everyone but  President recognizes Obama is terrible for America's future.
@SenMikeLee   Then why doesn't someone do something about it?  Impeach HIM!  WE The People are coming back 12/5/13  #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee I really thought Obama wanted to defund Obamacare and was going to use the shut down as an excuse end the trainwreck
@SenMikeLee NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION! Tea Party will never endorse a TAX by a Dictator! O'care is an utter FAILURE inside~out...
@SenMikeLee Wake up Mike! Obama doesn't care about USA. It's about changing USA for the world. Obama's America= No More Greatness.
@SenMikeLee POTUS couldn't care less about the American people. He never has & never will!
@SenMikeLee  HE DOES NOT CARE!
Really? That was an awful lot of Rep *aye* votes just now. I hate the majority of Congress right now. Hate, I say, HATE.  @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee sadly not enough of the senate and congress though. So glad they represent us. #pathetic
@SenMikeLee #sound #fury #signifying #nothing
@SenMikeLee They realize it, but what you guys don't get/ talk about is how this was meant to fail so the Dems can usher in single payer.
@SenMikeLee please dont give up  wtp need you guys  We got screwed!
@SenMikeLee I disagree with you Senator Lee. Lots of people support #Obamacare. It's not perfect - tell me about your plan for medical care?
@SenMikeLee keep fighting!!!  We r behind u!  Thank u so much
@SenMikeLee #ObamaDoesntCare so lets #RemoveObamaFromOffice
@SenMikeLee Yeah you are going to find out how terrible polls work in an election jackass. #GFYtraitor
“@SenMikeLee: Almost everyone but the president seems to recognize that #Obamacare is going to be terrible for the American people."

No.
@SenMikeLee Keep Fighting! @MakeDCListen.
