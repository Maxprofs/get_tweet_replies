@SenMikeLee @AlanAshton10 The constitution is dead.  Obama has been above the law for the last 7 years.
@Tulgaat @SenMikeLee Constitution not dead. Not enough ppl who know what it means & why there. We need a Cruz to remind them & follow it.
@AlanAshton10 @SenMikeLee That's a tall order.  Gonna take more than Cruz to do that job.  Not a single person I know gives a whit about it.
@Tulgaat @SenMikeLee I believe in Article V as well. He can't do it by himself but I never shut up when chance 2 talk abt Constitution!
@AlanAshton10 @SenMikeLee We need more like you.  I gotta recover my fight.  Things are looking grim for America.
@Tulgaat @AlanAshton10 @SenMikeLee I know. I get down abt direction of primary. It's scary so many ppl willing to throw all away cause angry
@SenMikeLee so what's your excuse for withholding the help that Flint, MI needs? #Hypocrite  #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee So why is @BarackObama records sealed ? And why is @tedcruz records sealed? Federal gov. the most corrupt institution @greta
@SenMikeLee  I am DEEPLY concerned about Obama's abuse of power. What has happened to our 1ce great nation? PLEASE help the AMERICAN people

@SenMikeLee @Shimmyfab will they do what CJ Roberts did so as not to let the Pres fail? 
@SenMikeLee Please respect the #TenthAmendment & oppose efforts for a federal ban of online poker.  It's a state's decision. #NoPokerBan
Good news. Anti-#poker, anti-#TenthAmendment @SenMikeLee (R-UT) drops bid for Senate leadership post: https://morningconsult.com/2016/04/mike-lee-drops-senate-gop-leadership-bid … #tcot
@RichMuny whew! He's got to go completely! He's among the most corrupt which is really saying something!  @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Congress rejected instate online poker bans in 2006. Adelson's RAWA restores nothing. It's a new ban. Please oppose RAWA.
@SenMikeLee You cannot be both against government overreach and for anti-states' rights HR 707.  Regulated online poker works - butt out.
@SenMikeLee UNBLOCK THE MONEY FOR FLINT WATER CRISIS! Call the Senator at #s 202-224-5444, 435-628-5514 & 801-524-5933 BLOW 'EM UP, AMERICA
@SenMikeLee  people wonder why Trump is so popular  ... it's bc we have no faith in our govt . I am truly disgusted .
@SenMikeLee legalize and regulate online poker, and support it. Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have proved economicly, it's better for all
@SenMikeLee If you actually believe in Constitutional rights for the people, support online poker. Let us make the choice.
@SenMikeLee release FLINT FUNDS NOW STOP GENOCIDE!
@SenMikeLee heartless bastard will not be re elected! #FlintWaterCrisis #HOLD
@SenMikeLee If the last 7 years had been under a republican prez, he would have been tarred and feathered then run out of town!
@SenMikeLee I agree that the rights of states should be respected and that online poker should not be banned.
@SenMikeLee  It is shameful that 4 of these judges have chosen to follow their ideal and agendas instead of the rule of law.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz why does gop get to not due their constitutional job of supreme Court nomination
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz will there be Amnesty and reward for all, Scotus has ruled, All created equal, Must be treated equal! ??
@SenMikeLee in order 4 there 2 b #ruleoflaw,#donothingcongress must actually enact, #adviseandconsent laws & revise & actually show up 4 wrk
@SenMikeLee If you haven't already please stop blocking the funds needed for Flint. These ppl suffered enough
@SenMikeLee  we r no longer a nation of laws :-(
@SenMikeLee @AprilKay14 -This is true, ask Hillary
@SenMikeLee How about you stop blocking the funds needed for Flint!
@senmikelee at least obama is trying to do something about immigration which cant be said about the do nothing congress.
@SenMikeLee Please respect the rights of states by rejecting calls to ban state-licensed online poker sites. Thank you. #TenthAmendment
@SenMikeLee.  Amen!!!
@SenMikeLee meantime, u are keeping the people of Flint, MI from getting the help they need #DoYourJob !!!!
@SenMikeLee Please support online poker.
@SenMikeLee Please respect the rights of states by rejecting calls to ban state-licensed online poker sites. Thank you. #TenthAmendment
@SenMikeLee Lee sponsoring  S. 1668 made it clear that he doesn't believe in free market principles when Sheldon Adelson pays him not to.
@SenMikeLee AS DO YOU SIR! 2 STOP THE INHUMANE TREATMENT&DISREGARD FOR YOUR CONSTIUENTS' WELLBEING.'SILENCE BREEDSCONSENT'&SPEAKS VOLUMES!
@SenMikeLee 

CAN YOU STOP BLOCKING FUNDING FOR #FlintWaterCrisis 

What is wrong w/ you sir? Don't all AMERICANS deserve CLEAN WATER
@SenMikeLee ...unblock the money for Flint!
@SenMikeLee #Please Stop Blocking the Funds for The Flint Michigan Water Crisis Immediately.
@SenMikeLee Shame on you senator blocking funds from Flint.  Release funds now!
@SenMikeLee instead of trying to talk about our President, why don't you do what you NEED to do, and that's to UNBLOCK THE FUNDS FLINT!!!!!
@SenMikeLee I agree with the pro poker tweets. We should authorize online poker, not ban it,
@SenMikeLee  Support the  legalization and regulation of online  poker .
@SenMikeLee And you should not violate the 10th Amendment by pushing a federal ban on online poker. It should be up to the states and people
@SenMikeLee Regulated Online Poker works in NV, NJ, & DE.  Oppose HR 707 & S 1668.  Prohibition is a Failed Policy.  Say No to RAWA!!!
@SenMikeLee You say you're for less gov't, yet you support Adelson's S.1668/RAWA bill that strips states of their #TenthAmendment rights.
@SenMikeLee If U believe in limited government, support online #poker in America for those who enjoy this card game. Also new $$ for gov.
@SenMikeLee Coming from an "individual" who is blocking financial help for #Flint.
@SenMikeLee except he has 4 justices who will always support his actions. And they are the law!  So corrupt
@SenMikeLee u should be held accountable for blocking funds to flint #HeartlessMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz problem is Obama thinks he's a king not a president doesn't care what the law is
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Also what happens when Congress doesn't make the laws and the courts do.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Today we realize what happens when Congress doesn't shut Obama down with the power of the purse.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz So are you two gay for each other?  Is that you you keep retweeting each other?  It's the love that can't be named!
@SenMikeLee @Live_Free_orDie I agree with your statement but this POTUS has operated outside the law for over 7 years
.@SenMikeLee Yet you're trying to violate New Jersey's #TenthAmendment-protected right to authorize online #poker.
@SenMikeLee Ted Cruz is not above the law; he was not born in the U.S. and therefor per our Consitution cannot be America's President. EVER!
@SenMikeLee @DrottM Ladies & Gents - your senate majority leader Mike Lee. (Sorry Mitch your toast)
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz SCOTUS will tell Texas that it's reps in Congress should deal with it. Too bad the Senate is elected by the people.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz no one except those with the right connections. The SCOTUS has placed itself above the Constitution
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Fabulist Republicans such as you 2 & the RW #SCOTUS (i.e. Citizens United) are making a mockery of the CONSTITUTION.
@SenMikeLee @t2gunner 
The Truth reveals itself at the perfect time.
https://twitter.com/stickyfacts/status/722125139345735682 …
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz why WE the people have asked why Obama has not been Impeached for not upholding his sworn obligation 2 uphold law
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Gee, Ted, I wonder what they would think about presidents who want to torture people?
@SenMikeLee @NRO 

If he is not above the law, he is walkin the
Street because he is boss of AG??
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz the word Illegal before the word immigration give you guys in DC a clue ? SCOTUS is sworn 2 uphold law also POTUS
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #FuckYou
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Unfortunately, our protectors of our Constitution have turned into change agents
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz No one is above the law? Trying telling #Obama that.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz fat chance of that. Half of them will support Obama no matter what
Don't Mess With Texas! Don't Mess With #TedCruz. #Texas rocks! @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #Immigration #SCOTUS
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz --Agreed!!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Crossing fingers SCOTUS will deem Obama's actions outside scope of his power;that he attempted law making #onlytrump
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz ,Tell that to ted Cruz and his wife golden sacks just like Hillary ,throw dollar bills at them
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Try Explaining That To Your Party.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz SCOTUS, POTUS, WHY!!! do they make them sound like STD's ??? Like, fuck, i have a bad itch, must be the SCOTUS. :S
@SenMikeLee BRING BACK OUR DEAD KILLED BY #ILLEGALALIENS
@SenMikeLee it's not about immigration;  it's about how much power the executive can wield autonomously. Prosecutorial discretion=despotism
@SenMikeLee Fear mongering from #DAPA opposition that immigrants will become a public charge burden of STs is false! Look#immigrantworkethic
.@SenMikeLee If the growing scent of the land can penetrate the DC bubble, maybe our #Constitution, of the #USA, will play a role.
@SenMikeLee prior precedent showed that President worked within executive power. This is not an issue of legality. #electionyr
@SenMikeLee they won't.
@SenMikeLee No one, Not even you and Your opinion is above what God wants to decide to #DAPA #DACA
@SenMikeLee  Please, look into the Mirror and REPEAT THOSE WORDS, except replace the words "No One" with one letter "I" or 3 letters "GOP"!
@SenMikeLee And, like almost everything else that comes before them, they'll decide along partisan lines. Constitutional reasoning b damned.
@SenMikeLee I'm sure #SCOTUS is a big fan of yours right now. Hope you get a nice little 4-4 tie...#DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee We can only pray that they make the right decision.
