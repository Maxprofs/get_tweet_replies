@SenMikeLee Thank you for your #standwithrand AND for actually voting NAY on John Brennan. Demand McCain/Graham apologize to all of you!
Did you ever get an answer from the WH on the drone strike issue? 13hrs was a long time just to drop the ball. @ConTeach @SenMikeLee
@StoreyLine @SenMikeLee Holder did finally send a letter saying that NO the president could NOT use a drone against unarmed US citizens.
Does Obama know this and concur? Kind of an important point since the president can send that down to the Sec Defense @ConTeach @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee watching you on CSPAN - Cable's new most watched network.
