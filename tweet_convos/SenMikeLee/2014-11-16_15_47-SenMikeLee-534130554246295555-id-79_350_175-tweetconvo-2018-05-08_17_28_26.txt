@SenMikeLee @bwtanker can you blame us
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Tough shit. You have had 6 years to pass a immigration bill and you haven't.
What EXACTLY are you going to do?
@SenMikeLee
@LillianNTX @SenMikeLee  I hope tweeting about it isn't all he does. He's part of the problem if he does nothing to stop it.
@SenMikeLee @walkerkpt  and here's a picture of 100 pct of Congress and SCOTUS after Obama coup:
@SenMikeLee @marinobuzz13 If GOP can't stop this illegal immigration they are impotent and elections mean NOTHING.
@SenMikeLee @WeThePeople1st You haven't been listening to the people who didn't vote, Obama has.
@SenMikeLee @Cate_Tweeting And 100% of the residents of the WH favour it. Guess what's gonna happen.
@SenMikeLee @marypatriott I oppose Congressional #amnesty being granted2 those in our country illegally as well! #NoAmnesty #SecuretheBorder
And the 2/3 who didn't vote told me they oppose it as well. @SenMikeLee @KarenMonsour12 Obama isn't the only BS artist in town. #NoAmnesty
@SenMikeLee @Photogbill222 So... Do something! @KarenMonsour12
@SenMikeLee @LATiffani1  at next election the Congress should pass a law that all cand. should be fully vetted,no hidden transcripts!
@SenMikeLee because @barackobama knows McConnell & Boehner will do nothing but whine like kicked dogs . A double middle finger to USA
@SenMikeLee @NetAdvisor and those are the 74% that Obama could not care about..not that he cares about other 26% either.. His Way or Highway
Shut him down.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @sunbeltgirl That's right Senator we want to stop the socialist freight train.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Only if you are a tea turd.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Tough shit.
.“@SenMikeLee: 74% of those who voted in last week's election oppose unilateral #ExecutiveAmnesty by the president: http://youtu.be/b0NeLzeTrIQ ”
@SenMikeLee - Right! Keep standing for principle Sen Lee! NO Amnesty! #DefundObamacare #fullrepeal #noamnesty - FULL O-CARE REPEAL!
@SenMikeLee @LATiffani1 STOP HIM, Sen. Lee! #TCOT
@SenMikeLee @instapundit Given that R's in Congress won't respond 2 Executive Amnesty, what would Obama have 2 do 2 cause R's 2 impeach him?
@SenMikeLee @instapundit only 74%?  We are f#$%ed   #ImpeachObama
@SenMikeLee @marypatriott And you guys appear to be powerless to stop it, or you don't have the backbone to do what's necessary.
@SenMikeLee .And 100% of informed patriots oppose it.
@SenMikeLee #PresidentReagan only "executive action" on Immigration was order federal agencies implement provisions of lawful legislation
@SenMikeLee Yep - and they get a vote in 2016 to show it again - shouldn't curb presidential power over it - exec order good pres-l tool
@SenMikeLee if ACA was written to elude or misdirect CBO (gruber) isn't this a Conspiracy?????????????????????
@SenMikeLee NO "Amnesty" is possible.   ONLY temporary deportation delay.  Don't make a tempest in a teapot.
@SenMikeLee ~ I'm sorry .. did I miss something?  Republicans SHUT DOWN the government a year ago .. and they just WON!
@lynette530 @SenMikeLee GOP filibuster was partially in response to the dirty SOB Harry Reid 'filling the tree'.
@SenMikeLee u lying stop lying the election have nothing to do with immigration
@SenMikeLee @nowiknowmyabcs 
I hope they stand there around and don't give in
@SenMikeLee With respect, you should heed your own advice Senator Lee. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/background-checks-bill_n_3103341.html …

@SenMikeLee @sunbeltgirl He doesn't give a sh*t, we didn't like Ocare either just ask Gruber whom he does not know
@SenMikeLee stop him with the power of the purse
@SenMikeLee @Monica9707 Analysis: Obama Prepares Most Serious Violation of His Oath of Office http://www.netadvisor.org/2014/11/15/analysis-obama-prepares-most-serious-violation-of-his-oath-of-office/#.VGlkF2ePmHs … #NoAmnesty #tcot #tlot
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Care to cite an independent source for that claim?
@SenMikeLee Not just Executive Amnesty, ANY AMNESTY!!
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net Obama doesn't listen to the American people.  He only hears voices from the far left.
@SenMikeLee @TheTeaParty_net we also oppose obummer and the dumbocRATS
@SenMikeLee and since on 36% of those eligible...actually voted your numbers are quite stale
@SenMikeLee Sir, what's this about Republican Hal Rodgers donor benefiting big if Obama does amnesty? I knew Gop couldn't be trusted
@SenMikeLee Seal the border first and then most Americans would favor a common sense, immigration policy with compassion for illegals
@SenMikeLee Why won't Obama seal the border? Why does he instruct Eric Holder not to enforce border immigration laws. Votes! Votes! Votes!
@SenMikeLee We the people know that, that's why we voted overwhelmingly for GOP. Now y'all need to do your jobs and stop this lawless thug
@SenMikeLee You mean 74% of the 52% who voted GOP out of the 38% who bothered to vote? Small change, my man.
@SenMikeLee Most Americans are concerned about open borders & illegal immigrants. Executive amnesty just makes more want to come illegally
@SenMikeLee Americans conned again! Executive amnesty makes the problems of illegal immigration & open borders worse. But It does buy votes
@SenMikeLee & POTUS, Boehner, & McConnell don't give a damn. We need the Republicans to fight! If that means money standoff, then do it!
@SenMikeLee obvious that PRES does not care about the will of the people and refuses to listen to what they say.
@SenMikeLee @IvanFollows OBAMA claims to represent those that didn't vote & the dead that usually vote
FIFY!  @SenMikeLee 74% of those who voted in last week's election oppose unilateral #ExecutiveAmnesty for the president:@JammieWF
@SenMikeLee I am opposed to unilateral #ExecutiveAmnesty.  Please fight it. Stand up to the Presidential overreach please.
@SenMikeLee If he tries to do it, impeach him !
@SenMikeLee I'm sorry Senator but no matter the %, this Admin gets away with whatever they want with no consequences. Its quite sad really.
@SenMikeLee Mike, Obama is representing all of those that had other things to do on election day. He heard them loud and clear, remember.
@SenMikeLee Why is Mitch the Clown McConnell gonna be Majority Leader? Only people who like him are cronies!
@SenMikeLee u believe everything your boss, Ted Cruz tells u!!  What a joke u baggers r!
@SenMikeLee Sen. Lee, deal makers in both parties will not be impacted & move forward to pass a bill that will not solve mess govt  created
@SenMikeLee Because truth is the corporate cronies that fund the BIG GOV'T GOP RINO's want amnesty for low cost labor.  Wake up senator!
@SenMikeLee Probably about the same percentage that Obama cares. He also "hears those that didn't vote".
@SenMikeLee so his plan is to screw us up one side & down the other #dumbvoters
@SenMikeLee 

The other 26% apparently smoked dope with obama in college.
@SenMikeLee therefore, I believe that's precisely what he'll do
@senmikelee 74% and this man is still going for it!  Incredible!
@SenMikeLee That is irrelevant!  Truth is the BIG GOV'T GOP RINO's that are bought and paid for by corporate cronies will do nothing!
@SenMikeLee I think #Gruber should go to jail for RIPPING OFF THE FEDS as he put it. Impeach Boehner and Biden, elect @TGowdy as speaker
@cmdorsey @SenMikeLee @tgowdy AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee  @SenateGOP   This whole amnesty issue with Obama proves One Thing.   He and His Democrats are Fanatic Socialists.
@LizConteBeach @SenMikeLee @SenateGOP or commies
@SenMikeLee he no longer cares #dems out of power and he's out in 2
