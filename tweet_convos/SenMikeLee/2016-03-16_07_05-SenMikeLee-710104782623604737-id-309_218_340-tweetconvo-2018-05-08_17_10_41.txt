@SenMikeLee #WeThePeople do have a voice. We voted for @POTUS to do his job. Now #DoYourJob. You're not the House of Lords.
@SenMikeLee @TEW_1787 You are a good man MR.Lee keep up The good fight My family an I will be praying for you thanks for all you do.
@Alasken12 @SenMikeLee 
Agreed, and join with that in every way!
@SenMikeLee Dems refused to allow Pres Bush to name a SC justice full 19 months out from election. Now they have to live by their own rules.
@Timpanist @SenMikeLee you mean when Alito was confirmed in early 2006?
@schmieder83 @SenMikeLee Following the Biden Rule... Uncle Joe argued for denying Bush a SC appt and won, now Dems have to live with it.
@Timpanist @SenMikeLee but they still voted and confirmed Alito though. So stating they reused to allow him to name a justice is false
@SenMikeLee we did. we voted for obama twice. #doyourjob
@Sarah_Nicolas @SenMikeLee We also elected a Republican Senate.
@Sarah_Nicolas @SenMikeLee Biden rules - funny how the Dems feel differently when the roles are reversed
@ChezAprilKern @SenMikeLee i'm not a democrat. i'm actually a registered republican
@Sarah_Nicolas @SenMikeLee I, for one, am sick of the Rep not standing up for our values.  This dec is too important.  Let voters decide.
@ChezAprilKern @senmikelee It's not license to practice partisan influence by blocking confirmation of entire slates of well-qualified noms
@Sarah_Nicolas @SenMikeLee The current nominee is not strong on the 2nd amendment.
.@SenMikeLee We *did* have a voice. We re-elected @BarackObama. He’s President until 1.20.2017. Grow up and #doyourjob. #DoYourJobFriday
@SenMikeLee Even for a government employee you are a little thick. The did have their say......they elected BO!! Your ilk failing to WIN!!
@SenMikeLee @fadboo Good man, Senator. R u the only one? I certainly dont believ @SenateMajLdr  lipflapping anymore.
@silverkait @SenMikeLee @SenateMajLdr I don't know, I don't believe any of them any more, in congress that is.
@fadboo @SenMikeLee @SenateMajLdr I believe Lee. I believe Gohmert. I believe Cruz. . .
@silverkait @SenMikeLee @SenateMajLdr Yes,yes,yes. I am lucky in that my new congressman has voted with us EVERY time. @RepKenBuck Awesome!
@fadboo @SenMikeLee @SenateMajLdr @RepKenBuck 

#Cruz is my Senator  
@silverkait @SenMikeLee @SenateMajLdr @RepKenBuck Lucky you!! Ted Cruz and Mike Lee are the smartest men to go to DC in eons!
@fadboo @SenMikeLee @SenateMajLdr @RepKenBuck Agreed.
@SenMikeLee Didn't the American people have their say in '08 and AGAIN in '12?  Why are you taking away their voices? #DOYOURFUCKINGJOB
@SenMikeLee    They had a voice in 2008 and 2012 you idiot. You're party will confirm the nomination when the Democrats keep the White House
@SenMikeLee We had a voice.  The President's term is still active.
Constitution is clear on this issue: president's term last four years.
@SenMikeLee The American people did have a voice, when we elected President Obama three years ago.
@itsdlevy @2sense2 @SenMikeLee
@Shelbypitt8Pitt @scottabeer @itsdlevy @SenMikeLee BOOM! BOOM!!!
@SenMikeLee Did u like the SCOTUS decision on Unions? I did. Hold off on hearing & I will be happy about more decisions. Or do ur job.
@SenMikeLee Yet, the RNC determined to deny the voters will if Trump wins most delegates, and deny him the nomination. That's NOT democracy
@SenMikeLee The people have spoken when we elected @POTUS TWICE, now #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee u are just like the rest Bought and Paid for
@SenMikeLee 

Trump
@SenMikeLee I'm from Utah. 15
month too long to wait on Garland. Do the work we are paying you to do! I'm for Trump because he cuts deals!
@SenMikeLee good, so you plan to hold a hearing, then? Repping the American people's voices is sorta your job, right? #DoYourJobFriday
@SenMikeLee we did & he's been the #POTUS for the past 7 years. Do your job & stop acting like such a baby.
@SenMikeLee We had our say three years ago. It was called a reelection. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Funny how the Dems thought differently with a Republican as POTUS.  Biden rules.  Stick to your guns!
@SenMikeLee We have a voice. We elected him twice. Your hypocrisy is glaring.
@SenMikeLee The people of the USA already have a voice on SCOTUS. Our President! Don't use us for your excuse to not do your job
@SenMikeLee Since you're up for reelection, please refrain from all voting: we really should give the American people a voice. #DoYourJob
.@SenMikeLee The American people spoke twice, electing @BarackObama. You are a LIAR. Your only principle is keeping your rich owners happy
@SenMikeLee @ItsJustJill  Well Senator, welcome to the ranks of TRUMP supporters!  : )
@SenMikeLee where were all these critics when Harry Reid was running the show. #karma
@SenMikeLee 
American people elected @POTUS 
#PresidentObama nominated #MerrickGarland 

#Senate #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee We have with a twice elected President. #DoYourJob #CountrybeforeParty
@NoiseCollector_ @SenMikeLee Tight knit groups whether they be politicians, media, talk radio - all team up against the people.
@SenMikeLee Good to see you're interested in the Constitution or maybe for you that should be a little "c"
@SenMikeLee Then get off your ass and do your job.
@SenMikeLee FOOL
@SenMikeLee The people did and do have a voice: we elected both @POTUS and you. Hold a hearing!
@SenMikeLee ALL Senators for re-election should recuse themselves from this process.  Be consistent, if you can't be intelligent. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee The people spoke in 2008 AND 2012. By mandate. The President has a 4 year term.  #DoYourJob or #LoseYourJob
@SenMikeLee we elected you too do your job last time I checked you represented me now go and vote on a superman court nominee.
@SenMikeLee we did 3 years ago. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee they did when they elected president Obama TWICE!
@SenMikeLee Trump get to be Pres/ he will nominate Sis / used the WH to endorse /hotels/clothings line/ etc/ not for voters/him it about $$$
@SenMikeLee the American people decided in 2008 and 2012. #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee Unless those Americans voiced their opinions in 2008, 2010, 2012, or 2014 #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee  "let the voters decide,".... the voters already did,they gave this President two terms and, the power to make this appointment.
@SenMikeLee you sir are a disgrace to this country and your office.  You're part of the problem, not the solution.  Dialogue not obstruction
@SenMikeLee For an alleged scholar, you sure are dim.
@SenMikeLee Cool story, bro .... The American people had their say when they elected @POTUS
@SenMikeLee 65,000,000 had a voice in 2012. President Obama was elected. He is still President asshole.
@SenMikeLee The American people did have a voice in deciding who will be Justice Scalia's replacement - it was called the election of 2012
@SenMikeLee The American people DO have a voice in the SpCt Justice selection. It's called electing the President. Must I remind you!
@SenMikeLee  Listen moron, the people have a voice. They had a voice when they twice elected Barrack Obama. #SCOTUS
@SenMikeLee We did have a voice. We elected Barack Obama president. Twice. He has 309 days left in his term. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Merrick Garland has seven Supreme Court  related decisions in one he voted to ban guns in DC 2nd amendment not withstanding.
@SenMikeLee It's not the "People's Choice Awards." #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee They elected POTUS, you, and your colleagues who are sitting at the time of his death.
meet, listen, vote. Repeat if necessary
@SenMikeLee Our voices WERE heard in Nov 2012, when we elected Pres. Obama for a FOUR year term. It's 10 mos. till 1/20/17. Do your job!
@SenMikeLee You know they decided 3 years ago, right? Presidential term is 4 years. Do your job.
@SenMikeLee time to elect someone who understands #SenateDoYourJob #Utah #VoteDemocrat #Vote2016
@SenMikeLee You want the American people to have a say?

We had our say when we reelected President Obama.   

#doyourjob
@SenMikeLee Pretty sure that's what I voted for when I voted for this president
@SenMikeLee You're dedicated to taking that choice away. We already voted for Obama. He is president.
.@senmikelee Are you talking about new American people since Obama was last elected? Because 3 year-olds can’t vote.
@SenMikeLee - Can't wait till HRC nominates on or two SCOTUS judges - you will be crying in your beer that you did not do this one – at Singer Island
@SenMikeLee we had one..we elected President...#doyourjob or you basically are welfare recipient collecting our $$
@SenMikeLee I am a citizen and my voice says #doyourjob!! Stop playing politics, Mr. Lee. If I refused to do my job, I'd be fired.
.@SenMikeLee We already spoke our voice, when we voted for Obama twice.
@adamlauria @SenMikeLee And we also elected a Republican Senate.  Biden rules suck when it's the other way around....
@ChezAprilKern Biden was wrong then, and @SenMikeLee is wrong now. Obama is doing his job and Senate isn't doing theirs, period
@adamlauria @SenMikeLee You're certainly entitled to your opinion.
@ChezAprilKern the situations also aren't analogous, Biden was speaking hypothetically & Judiciary Cmt decided obstruction b4 O named a name
@ChezAprilKern Bidens own words are here
@SenMikeLee How about letting us vote for term limits as well!
@SenMikeLee DO YOUR JOB!!!!
@SenMikeLee PBO was elected to office twice. That is what the people chose. Are you really that obtuse and dimwitted?
@SenMikeLee it isn't up to the American people. It's up to the president, who the American people voted for...
@SenMikeLee The American people have a voice, and it was heard four years ago. We elected the current president (much to your dismay)
@SenMikeLee You seem committed to not doing your job whilst still getting paid. I am an American person and you should hold a hearing.
@SenMikeLee we did that when the majority voted for the @POTUS  whose job includes the nomination of justices.
.@SenMikeLee The American people elected you to represent them. That's what Democracy is all about. DO YOUR JOB! #tcot #gutlesswonder
@SenMikeLee The people HAVE spoken: we elected Obama twice! Do your job and stop being obstructionist.He is doing his!
@SenMikeLee https://www.createspace.com/5607739 . The #FoundingFathers never meant for citizens to have a voice re #SCOTUS pick.
@SenMikeLee We did, when the majority voted #Obama into office for the 2nd time in 2012. Show your commitment to us by #ConfirmingGarland.
@SenMikeLee they already have, asshat.
@SenMikeLee please don't cave
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob  or you all will be voted OUT / sick of your obstruction politics / you should be ashamed
@SenMikeLee That is not in the Constitution, Mike. From self proclaimed Constitution devotees, it's pure hypocrisy.
@SenMikeLee We already had that voice when we elected President Obama to a second term. A term that does not end for 10 months.
@SenMikeLee The people chose when @POTUS was re-elected, and we'll choose a Democrat again in Nov. You should shut up and #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee We spoke when we voted Obama in for a FULL second term. We want him to pick SCOTUS. Do your jobs!
@SenMikeLee Elections have consequences, and if you don't sign up with this guy, never know who @HillaryClinton might send up! #DoYourJob
.@SenMikeLee The American People voted for President Obama. Twice. Were you out of the country at the time? #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee  How stupid do you think the American people are? Do your job.
@SenMikeLee And finally, this childish behavior is why the #American people want an outsider to win in 2016. Please do your job. #utahvoters
@SenMikeLee FYI, we already had a voice in this, 4 years ago. I think we made it pretty clear. #doyourduty #childish
@SenMikeLee Yeah, we had a voice in 2012 when we elected @BarackObama
@SenMikeLee We did.  Three years ago when we elected the president to do his job.  Now do yours. #doyourjobcongress
@SenMikeLee  So you want @realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton to take care of this? #blowingit #republicandeathspiral #republicanimplosian
@SenMikeLee We did, in 2012, when we elected @POTUS by 5 million votes. #DoYourJob
I was happy to vote to re-elect Pres Obama, @SenMikeLee, who has nominated the next Supreme Court judge. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee They do have a voice ... They elected #Obama - twice ! For 4 yr terms .. Not 3! #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob stop obstructing the government!
@SenMikeLee the people spoke when the @GOP lost two elections and the president's favorable numbers are higher than your Congress's
@SenMikeLee we already have a voice in it.  we chose that voice to be @BarackObama
.@SenMikeLee: You're a disgrace. This has nothing to do with the people having a voice. You're just hoping for a Republican president.
@nifkinjuice @SenMikeLee this coward won't answer you because he's too busy hiding from his responsibilities
@nifkinjuice @SenMikeLee Imagine what would happen if the British attacked us again while this coward was in charge
@SenMikeLee the American people do have a voice. They voted for President Obama. Now do your constitutional duty!
@SenMikeLee Obama has been the obstructionist in chief he say he can legislate any time he wants lib jerks.
@SenMikeLee you are the second senator I have seen today who doesn't seem to have any idea how US political process works.
@senmikelee We stand with the President Judge Garland is more than qualified #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee Obama can only nominate this judge is a total lib and when you vote remember McCain Susan Collins and Oren hatch vote in
@SenMikeLee you should be fired #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee We do. We elected the President twice and want him to do his job now #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee they did have a say.  They elected Obama twice.
@SenMikeLee Thank you, Senator Lee.
@SenMikeLee They already had a voice, jackass. What you're committed to is obstruction.
@SenMikeLee they had a voice when Obama was elected for 4 more years. Do your job
@jdartute @SenMikeLee looking like a centrist may be the best move today
@SenMikeLee I like the way you uphold the constitution and believe you are doing a good job. Ignore social democrats behind iron curtain.
@SenMikeLee And as a Utahan, I'm committed to not voting for obstructionist Senators who created this toxic environment.
@SenMikeLee we already had our say. We elected president Obama. Do your job!
@SenMikeLee Just because you didn't like what you heard didn't mean we didn't say it. Represent us and vote!
.@SenMikeLee we elected Obama for 8 years, not 7 you dope.
@SenMikeLee We DO have a voice. We used it twice. You were elected to implement what the people want. When are you going to listen?
@SenMikeLee You are committed to nothing more than your own selfish agenda. Stop letting everybody down #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee we used our voice by electing the president twice. Constitution is pretty clear on this, you traitor.
@SenMikeLee We do have a voice. We the people elected him 3 years ago. Stop being a child and hold a hearing.
@SenMikeLee It blows my mind that someone like you can say this when we all know, that YOU KNOW how you don't even believe it, Counselor.
@SenMikeLee We did have a voice when we elected Obama. Do your job.
@SenMikeLee didn't the people decide when he was overwhelmingly reelected to the Presidency? #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Anti-gunner, anti-free speech Merrick Garland? NO WAY!!!
@SenMikeLee Excuse me, but they already did have a voice.  Have you forgotten about the 2012 election, Senator?
@SenMikeLee the American people did decide. Twice.
@SenMikeLee So basically you lied when you swore to defend and follow US Constitution. We the people spoke. Voted for Pres. Obama twice.
@SenMikeLee You're an elected politician, yet you're unfamiliar with the constitutional notion of judicial independence?  You're a joke.
@SenMikeLee and you endorse Cruz? What is the logic?
.@SenMikeLee Hear my voice: How many ppl elected you? How many ppl elected POTUS? You do not speak for America. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee We already did when we elected President Obama. Twice. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee We do have a voice. We elected Barack Obama president. We expect him to do his job & the senate to do theirs. Quit obstructing
@SenMikeLee I had my say in 2012. I voted Romney. And? Obama did his job. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Normal humans see what kind of nutjobs you guys are today your only hurting the country right now. We see through this BS
@SenMikeLee No you aren't - I voted in the '12 election to determine who would be president for following 4 years- You are denying my voice.
@SenMikeLee We id have a voice when we ELECTED OBAMA TWICE!!!. If you don't at least have hearings Clintons going to go WAY left.

@SenMikeLee @LibertyBell1000 guess I need to learn Dr John King is, my page keeps going blank? Thank you senator! Your a God sent!
@SenMikeLee call the Prez bluff and appoint the 63 year old moderate.
@SenMikeLee Hey, uh, Genius? This petty tantrum disguised as populism, here? That's how the Race-Baiting Fascist got to be our nominee. FYI.
@SenMikeLee You are also up for re-election, Senator. How on earth can you function with this level of hypocrisy?
@SenMikeLee weird I thought we already did

@SenMikeLee Would you rather have Trump place one of his friends on SCOUS?
@SenMikeLee @Kegan05 Congress does not have a constitutional duty to have a hearing or confirm anyone. Dems did not confirm for 19 months.
@SenMikeLee Please stop the partisan grandstanding and do your job.
@SenMikeLee The American people had their say in 2012.
@SenMikeLee The American people made their voice heard, twice, when we elected @POTUS. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee
