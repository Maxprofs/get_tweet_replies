@SenMikeLee What about the Flint crisis that is mostly affecting the poor?
@SenMikeLee yep u want federalizing financing of badly needed infrastructure .
.@SenMikeLee Why do you support a big govt ban on iPoker. Are you abandoning the #TenthAmendment, like @marcorubio?
@SenMikeLee      What bullshit!
@SenMikeLee Utah is a haven for extremists & anti government nut cases, you're one that got elected. You're another "Lee Atwater" con artist
@SenMikeLee Please end your efforts to strip states of their #TenthAmendment right to authorize online poker.
@SenMikeLee tell the truth Senator.
@SenMikeLee bullshit
@SenMikeLee S. 1668 (RAWA) is intended to squash the competition for Sheldon Adelson. This legislation is the epitome of crony capitalism.
@SenMikeLee #MikeLee serves his donors by putting profits before citizens he loves the #FlintWaterCrisis happy for those that are sick
.@SenMikeLee Yet you cosponsor S 1668, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson's anti-#TenthAmendment bill to shut down states' #poker websites.
@RichMuny @SenMikeLee Banning iGaming IS excessive regulation, especially at the behest of an owner of B&M casinos !
@SenMikeLee @RichMuny Please end your efforts to strip states of their #TenthAmendment right to authorize online poker.
@SenMikeLee How about regulations to stop them from getting lead-free water?
@SenMikeLee That's why kids in Flint continue to drink lead today as you hold the bill that would help?
@SenMikeLee Please reject Sheldon Adelson & #CronyCapitalism by opposing S1668, a bill to shut down state-authorized poker websites.
@SenMikeLee How do you sleep at night? Blocking bills to help the people of Flint....You are part of the problem, not the solution
@SenMikeLee   For states’ rights (protected by the #TenthAmendment), and for liberty, please support #OnlinePoker. Thank you. #10A
@SenMikeLee And yet you placed a hold on the bill to aid the people of Flint? Perhaps you & your family can live there until you release it.
@SenMikeLee Yes, no regulations really helped the people of #flint. To bad we can't help them, oh wait it's only you holding up the vote.
@SenMikeLee Full of crap. Sorry. Regulations stop your corporate masters, satan.
@SenMikeLee you mean like your refusal to help Flint, despite wanting federal help when Utah needed it?
@SenMikeLee Did David Duke endorse you too? The separatist,  anti government types that flock to Utah must really be proud of you
.@SenMikeLee @MMFlint time for this senator to go! #Utah vote him out!
@SenMikeLee No. They dont.
@SenMikeLee Politspeak bullshit. The poor are exactly who are hurt by lack of oversight of your corporate masters.
@SenMikeLee You're lying; lack of regulation killed 29 coal miners... how many people in Flint?   U R establishment
@SenMikeLee HAHAHAHA...oh wait, you're serious #GOPFail
@SenMikeLee What about this secret "HOLD' on Flint HELP. You are totally useless to anyone in America. Wake up ya dope! Where is Inhofe?
@SenMikeLee Excessive regulations impact BIG BUSINESS, not the poor! Stop being a liar!
@SenMikeLee There has not been a single case of anyone from Utah accessing a licensed #poker site. States have a right to allow iPoker.
@SenMikeLee what regulations did the "people" of Flint have? Children have been/keep being poisoned. #Flint #GOP
@SenMikeLee I agree with those supporting regulation of online poker. Please oppose a federal ban. #LetStatesDecide #NoPokerBan
@SenMikeLee you mean like placing a procedural "hold" on an aid bill to help the poor in Flint, MI? You are a hypocrite!
@SenMikeLee regulations impact the poor by protecting them from rich sociopaths. Stop sacrificing public health for campaign cash
THIS document @SenMikeLee makes me think #FlintWaterCrisis WAS possibly population control & WAS on purpose @onetoughnerd #GOP #NoGOP
@AnitaNelson @SenMikeLee @onetoughnerd Its neglect of their obligation to the people. Save a few bucks, or whatever the motivation.criminal.
@llennirG_nosaJ The propaganda @SenMikeLee is pushing against REGULATIONS is shocking after the @onetoughnerd #FlintWaterCrisis #NoGOP
>@SenMikeLee This is the most TWISTED thing I've ever seen! The problem is REGULATIONS?! REALLY?!! #NoGOP #GOP #FlintWaterCrisis
@SenMikeLee Your colleague in Utah & the House Jason Chaffetz has admitted that Geolocation works. Please drop your support of RAWA.
.@SenMikeLee And what is holding up help for #FlintWaterCrisis ? How dare you use the poor & income inequality while holding up #Flint help!
@SenMikeLee In actuality Mike, regulations do not increase income inequality.  You sound like @realDonaldTrump. " If I say it, its true".
@SenMikeLee, your actions regarding Flint are reprehensible. The only logical explanation for such a thing is that you are a sociopath.
@SenMikeLee Do u really think all Voters are Dumb? Look what Deregulation did for $$ in Politics, Banks or Wall st?
Jesus Christ, how does @SenMikeLee sleep at night? #FlintWaterCrisis Children have been poisoned.
NEW: The senator holding Flint aid hostage http://thebea.st/1ORMR1H  
@SenMikeLee What the hell do you care about the poor?
@SenMikeLee kind of the same way poisoned water impacts them
@SenMikeLee Yeah...lets just let people be poisoned.  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/02/the-senator-holding-flint-aid-hostage.html …
@SenMikeLee So y r u opposing #FlintWaterCrisis aid legislation,4 reasons which appear procedural or ideological. w/ hypocritical "hold"?
@SenMikeLee you forgot to add "benefits the 1%"
@SenMikeLee @Tokyo_Tom Yes, and Yes
.@SenMikeLee AZ AG Mark Brnovich opposes your bill that would close states' poker websites. Let the states decide:
@SenMikeLee Tell that to the people of Flint!

@SenMikeLee 
#CruzorBust
Thank you for your endorsement of @tedcruz 
#SaveOurRepublic
@SenMikeLee Plenty of case studies show that the negative impacts of deregulation hurt low income families the most. #garbageresearch #nope
@SenMikeLee Nation cannot permit Wealthy Predators to do what they did to Nation's Financial Sector; to, other Sectors of U.S. Economy.
@SenMikeLee It was the lack of Regulations & Competent Oversight that turned, so- called Capitalists into Predators - with License to Steal.
@SenMikeLee Pure RW Tripe.  Deregulation single biggest factor in bringing Developed World Economies to their knees; especially U.S.!
@SenMikeLee SOS maybe Rubio Cruz or Cruz Rubio ticket. Cld pull rug out from under DT for the good of the country. 11th hr You 3 can do it.
@SenMikeLee Regulations in general. Used to support an entity over another.
@SenMikeLee it time to endorse Cruz. Seriously
@SenMikeLee Still sounds like a lie, better practice in front of a mirror.
@senmikelee your country is more important than your “friendships” and popularity…..isn’t it?? ENDORSE TED CRUZ!!! IT’S TIME!!
