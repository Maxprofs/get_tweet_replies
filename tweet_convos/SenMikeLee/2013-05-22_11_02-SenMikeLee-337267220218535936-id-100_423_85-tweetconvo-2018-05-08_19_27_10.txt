@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 

Thank you, Senators, for taking a stand for America.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and Ameicans!
@SenMikeLee @jsheets19 @SenTedCruz We all know less damage will be done by shutting down the govt. than raising the debt limit. Stay strong!
.@SenMikeLee @PolitixGal @SenTedCruz The more important issue is why Barry Soetoro is using HJ Bounel's SS#. Anybody got the COURAGE to ask?

We must STAND TOGETHER against raising The Debt Ceiling without a Plan To REDUCE SPENDING!!
â€œ@SenMikeLee: I joined Senator Rubio and @SenTedCruz to oppose raising the debt ceiling ..." Its been raised so many times, its meaningless!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 
Raising the debt ceiling is for stuff we already payed for. 
Are you this clueless? Cut military spending by 40%
