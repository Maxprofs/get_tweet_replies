@SenMikeLee @GaragistePhil Call it what you will As long as it not privatized it will remain in the "public's" hands
@sailvarmint @SenMikeLee but is it really "public"?
@GaragistePhil @SenMikeLee It aint private and that's good enough for me
@sailvarmint @SenMikeLee yeah, try taking a strolll there during a "shutdown".

@SenMikeLee @RepStaceNelson Our Federal Government hasn't been truly federal for a long time; let's just call it what it is, National Gov..
@SenMikeLee It is time to defederalize all land.
@SenMikeLee #StandStrong #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee stay strong!
@SenMikeLee @Rhondako and with who's money did us purchase said land
This > RT @DaleHStump: @SenMikeLee @Rhondako and with who's money did us purchase said land
@SenMikeLee @lillymckim Funny, it would never occur to me to follow someone I don't like in order to insult them. Liberal behavior????
@liane2552 . Sorry, I'm not following what you're saying? :0)
@lillymckim I'm sorry. I was responding to all the people who were insulting Sen. Lee.
.@liane2552 . I thought so after I read back thru the tweets :0)
@SenMikeLee So, the land Hillary used as collateral-China Loans, is FED Land or were DEMs planning to lose Private Citizen land in default?
@SenMikeLee King's Lands.  Land reform! Open up every square inch of Federal Land Parks conservancies Forests each citizen selects his acre.
It's all Obama's..:( RT @msschantz: @SenMikeLee @GirlOnMission What would you call it? Is public n            (cont) http://tl.gd/mq2tkg 
ATT Dems: This is how u debate. Informed. Civil, Direct. No name- calling  ==> @SenMikeLee http://ow.ly/pCAW6 
@SenMikeLee @DebbieBess The federal government owns NO land: they violated treaties, erected structures they don't maintain, manage nothing.
@SenMikeLee @mimimayesTN Don't let your party or the Dems get away with this crap! Stand strong the American people are behind you!!
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator Lee for all you do:)
@SenMikeLee @lillymckim Very true!  Thank you for your service.
@SenMikeLee @PredictionMan As Churchill said to Congress "...never cease to persevere against them until they have been taught a lesson."
@SenMikeLee @PredictionMan Federal Gov't was created by States & the People, and time has come to return it to its Constitutional Roots!
@SenMikeLee @PredictionMan The Federal Gov't, meaning Dems & their stooge Obama, are like a banker who says you can't access your money!
@SenMikeLee Thanks for your patriotism. Don't back down.
@SenMikeLee Closing Nat'l Forest and Rec Area facilities and Boat Ramps in UT - Strawberry and Fl'g Gorge. W/ deer season in 2 weeks = ugly
@SenMikeLee @ConserValidity I beginning to think that states could do a better job
@SenMikeLee @backatone000 Return the land to the States.
@SenMikeLee keep up the good work.  You're helping fix the problem instead of adding to it.
@SenMikeLee Amen #obamashutdown #harryreidshutdown #Demshutdown
@SenMikeLee Thank you for taking the slings & arrows..We're still Standing with you! Keep Faith with us, we'll keep Faith with you!
I think @SenMikeLee it's time to instead talk about reducing the AMOUNT of land owned by the #FederalGovernment. #MakeDCListen #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee Yes
.@SenMikeLee Is there any support in Congress for returning the majority of federal lands to the states? #MyEasternLandlord #tcot #shutdown
@SenMikeLee @RTHTGakaRoland thank you for standing with the ppl that don't have a voice that's ever heard...stand tall and strong. bless you
@SenMikeLee You're an idiot! The federal government is the PUBLIC. Try reading the constitution- the people own and run our nation!
@SenMikeLee why? What so u propose we use instead?
@SenMikeLee #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee And let's refer to America as  a Republic cause it ain't a democracy as u should know 50%+1 don't win here.
@SenMikeLee and they should stop using the word #default while at it. #POTUS #shutdown #ACA
@SenMikeLee @formerbondgirl Mark Levin floated idea of it becoming privately owned, prevent owners being held hostage by government.
@SenMikeLee amen
@SenMikeLee usurped a good substitute?
@SenMikeLee  Agreed.The land clearly belongs to the Federal Government, not the people.
@SenMikeLee @katadams14 . Take back our lands from the Feds. #abuseofpower
@SenMikeLee please keep up the good work
@SenMikeLee thank you and please keep fighting!
@SenMikeLee 
I wish lying was a crime so the democrats would be in prison
@SenMikeLee We are proud of you please stay strong. Obama will have to negotiate one day
@SenMikeLee @1969tttt Amen! Whatever happened to 'this land is my land, this land is your land...this land was made for you and me.'?
@SenMikeLee  thankyou for standing strong .... keep it up ..
@SenMikeLee  thank you Sen Lee @HarrietBaldwin
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU for standing up for freedom and trying to keep Progressives from destroying our nation. I admire your courage!
@SenMikeLee The park closings shows what can happen when the gov. has total control over something. And some want it running healthcare too.
@SenMikeLee @jonzies no it's time to give all that land back to the states.  And the NA lands the deed so they can thrive.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for  giving me a ray of hope in the midst of the insanity.  Common sense is becoming very rare in our leadership.
@SenMikeLee You're right. It's only "public" when it's politically expedient and when the libs choose to let its real owners use it.
@SenMikeLee It's time to reign in the BS. Public servants work 4 the people. And public lands are 4 the benefit of the people. #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee Obama's clearly in over his head. #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee If the businesses are paying their leases then Obama is breaking the contract by shutting them down. "It's the law!"
@SenMikeLee Are you sure the federal government owns them or have they already be sold & given to China
@SenMikeLee If "pubic lands" were managed by "private enteprise" the word #Shutdown would become obsolete. #MakeDCListen #DefundIt
Please propose legislation to return most federal land to the states. Thanks. @SenMikeLee @museofhistory
@SenMikeLee as a fellow Utahan#. We met in southern Utah. We understand how much the blm controls! Keep it up sen!
@SenMikeLee WHat do you think is going to happen when people find out the TARP II bonas to #SNAP drops out this November. #Mepolitics
@allforjury @SenMikeLee fuck SNAP get a fucking job
@TH3R34LTRUTH "Nation lives on it's stomach... Feed the people you quell unrest. Starve them and you insure riot"-the prince @SenMikeLee
@allforjury @SenMikeLee they should feed themselves through hard work or go out and kill an animal or grow some vegetables oh forgot that
@SenMikeLee It's time to end the rhetoric and end the Shutdown.  #EndTheShutdownNOW
@SenMikeLee Your destroying the vision of Teddy Roosevelt by saying that. It sad that someone needs a campaign issue.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for your part in ruining our country!
Your proctologist called, he left a message for you in #butthurt. @CherylFull88 @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee No it's time to give the land managed by the Feds to the states.
@SenMikeLee It should be repatriated.
