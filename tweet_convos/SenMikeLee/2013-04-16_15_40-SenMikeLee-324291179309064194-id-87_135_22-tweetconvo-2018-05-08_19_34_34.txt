@SenMikeLee Love you, Mike - But WE THE PEOPLE are  sick and GD tired of this! No passage of these bills until we read it!
@SenMikeLee NOT READING the bill is clearly Congressional Malfeasance and should be a crime of negligence.
@SenMikeLee  I fully support you on gun control and upholding our 2nd amendment rights... stay strong...
@SenMikeLee just  like Obama care its pathetic
@SenMikeLee if you don't know what is in it you are obligated to vote no. Keep up the good work
@SenMikeLee Go to Boston, propose banning backpacks, assault duffels and high capacity pressure cookers.  Restrictions on ball bearings too!
@SenMikeLee how can you debate what you cannot #ReadTheBill
@senmikelee @ambeachy ya'll better read it 1st....#tcot
@SenMikeLee I'm counting on you to look into this matter about the Saudi National being involved with the Boston bombing.
@SenMikeLee My web version of the bill was put up on Thursday but impossible to get any visibility. Links are on my profile @getoffmyline
@SenMikeLee This is so ridiculous. It's unbelievable that anyone would put up with this.!  People need time to read and think things over.
@SenMikeLee 
Hey, didn't BHO promise three days online first??!
@SenMikeLee You Republicans never read the bills.
@SenMikeLee Yes, what is the rush on it anyway...I don't see any reason to push it through
@SenMikeLee Seriously 844 pages and many concerning elements. Shut it down!  @marcorubio #fail #tcot #tpp
@SenMikeLee it's not unfortunate sir, it's corruption. Glad to see that you are one of the few unbought. #fillabuster
@SenMikeLee well read fast. Its Washington. What you expect?
@SenMikeLee why is there such a short time limit?
@SenMikeLee @michaelwweston 
It's not "Unfortunate", it's Deliberate.  #ReadTheBill!!! @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul
No to To Read:@SenMikeLee just Say NO.
@SenMikeLee What's the hurry.
@SenMikeLee  thats crap since when do people do business that way? How about that Mombasa Birth cert?seems more important to #impeachobama
@SenMikeLee We the people, the LEGAL citizens should be allowed to vote on this--not you guys.
@SenMikeLee  tell Schumer & Leahy. Schumer says he wants a national conversation. We all know he just wants the media spotlight--at any cost
@SenMikeLee How do you handle the blatant ineptness you are faced with on a daily basis?  How do many of your colleagues sleep at night?
@jjauthor @SenMikeLee: It's unfortunate to have so little time 2#ReadTheBill b4 hearings on #immigration reform: http://ow.ly/k89xX ”
@SenMikeLee its not unfortunate its by design... just like obamacare. you all every one of you need to be kicked out.
@SenMikeLee so vote NO!  Don't vote on anything you haven't read please...
@SenMikeLee the convoluted Leviathan will win again.  Madison warned us about the atrocities of voluminous laws in the Federalist Papers.
@SenMikeLee  What do they say about children who do poorly in school? They can't read. Congress refuses to read.
@SenMikeLee @tripodcat73 Please read it, all of it
@SenMikeLee If Americans aren't given time to read it & there aren't plenty of hearings & debate, filibuster the damned bill. We R fed up
@SenMikeLee Shoving a Bill through without reading and knowing what's in it? This is like Deja Vu!

http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=ACbwND52rrw&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DACbwND52rrw …
@SenMikeLee a 1500 page bill? guaranteed you will never get to read it all, cuz they double it after it gets passed. did it 2 BamaCare bill
@SenMikeLee Simple. Don't do it until time has been made. USA future vested in hands like URs. God help us all.
@SenMikeLee if you can't read it you should never vote for it
@SenMikeLee #ReadTheBill #immigration Shouldn't every Senator w a conscience vote no for that reason alone? Wait, ... http://tmi.me/Sotr5 
@SenMikeLee that isn't right....and tell Marco I said so! How can you all work for "We The People" w/o reading bills? Smells like #obamacare
@SenMikeLee If you don't know whats in it you can't vote for it!  Think O-care & Pelosi......#benghazi
@SenMikeLee You could spend those Fridays you spend not working reading upcoming legislation.
@SenMikeLee Oh, you mean that bill that's been online for 2+ weeks?
.@SenMikeLee If you can't read it, I would think it would have an automatic "No" vote. Don't you think?
@SenMikeLee Illegal immigration costing us 345 billion a year. No to amnesty!
@SenMikeLee not buying it. your jobs is to make sure you know what its about for us who employ you, otherwise you should look for a new job
@SenMikeLee If by unfortunate you mean "what the hell are they hiding?" We agree!! PLEASE stop them.
@SenMikeLee Hurrying to pass bad law is a recipe for suffering to those that have to live under it.
@SenMikeLee 'Senate and Congress need to live under the laws they pass. Make this into an Amendment I'm sure 'We the People would support."'
@SenMikeLee  Just say NO  CLOSE THE BORDER  This open border is destroying the Western Hemisphere
@SenMikeLee That's what filibusters are for...feel free to use it! We don't want this #Amnesty bill....
@SenMikeLee Yes, epic fail.
@SenMikeLee The strategy of tyrants: "We have to pass the bill to find out what's in the bill."
@SenMikeLee this is the same old line just like Obamacare. Why dont all of you demand i so just vote no unless strict border control is firs
@SenMikeLee so that's easy - Vote NO
@SenMikeLee @marcorubio @SenatorReid The citizens want Senators to have enough time to #ReadTheBill, DO NOT RUSH IT THROUGH!  #immigration
@SenMikeLee

DO NOT VOTE ON
ANYTHING YOU DON'T
THOROUGHLY READ
& UNDERSTAND.
ANYONE.
EVER.
@SenMikeLee Do your damn jobs and READ what is placed in front of you There should be NO bill EVER passed without reading it.
@SenMikeLee This is outrageous!  Other news events are taking over the wires. The hearings should be delayed...
@SenMikeLee is this the transparency that this administration touts? Just like ACA?
@SenMikeLee please read the full bill Senator.
@SenMikeLee I get tired of this moaning about not having enuf time to read these important bills before voting on them!  Vote NO!  Simple!
@SenMikeLee Sen. Lee, you don't have to vote yes, if you don't have time to read it!  Duh!
@SenMikeLee @SenMikeLee: It's unfortunate that we will have so little time to #ReadTheBill.
 #ReidTheBill
@SenMikeLee If you can't read it vote no. It's a simple concept really, "I'm not sure if the milk is still good?" "Don't drink it!"
@SenMikeLee #immigrationreform is a tool for corporations to get cheap labor,for senators to make money by thrashing Americans #readthebill
@SenMikeLee it's not u fortunate, it's offensive. #Readthebill @RoyBlunt  but I'll bet @clairecmc votes for it any way.
@SenMikeLee why are you letting them get away with it?
@SenMikeLee read the bill before voting?  Are you serious?  Next you're going to want to ask questions.
@SenMikeLee Unfortunate? I'd say it is criminal. Someone needs to dig in their heels and stop the insanity.
@SenMikeLee That's wrong! But at least you are trying to get everyone to read it.
@SenMikeLee This reflects badly on those who pass for the "leaders" of the Senate. #ReadTheBill Push to pass it fast speaks volumes.
@SenMikeLee Unfortunate isn't the right word. Intentional and deliberate is.
@SenMikeLee why u need to read it,gang of 8,@BarackObama @SenatorLeahy already got money for it from corporations,they will pass it anyway
@senmikelee Then vote no . Remember obamacare .
@SenMikeLee Unfortunate? It should be criminal!
@SenMikeLee Thank you
