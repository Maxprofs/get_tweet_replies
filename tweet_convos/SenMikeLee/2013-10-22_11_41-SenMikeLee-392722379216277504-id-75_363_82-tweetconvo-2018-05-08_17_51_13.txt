@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  If business has small # of staff,  Act does not even affect them. Using Act to justify their move is pretty petty.
@champa10 @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 3) my employees are FORCED to buy insurance, or pay fine; hurts them, AND it subtracts that $ from economy
@elmothegr8 @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  Your employees are not forced to buy ins  if income is above certain mark.  Of course you knew that.
@champa10 @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 1) I pay above minimum wage. "Minimum" has certain connotations.
@SenMikeLee 77% of the People want it defunded & want Obama impeached, why will Senate & Congress not act? #impeachObama #defundobamacare
@2ndAmndmntDfndr @SenMikeLee Because there is absolutely no law he has broken. You can dislike him but there is no impeachable offense.
@champa10 @2ndAmndmntDfndr @SenMikeLee If anyone’s looking for Obama’s legacy, IT’S IN THE CRAPPER HAVING A SMOKE
@ProfessorRobo @2ndAmndmntDfndr @SenMikeLee Come on...be an adult here.  On second thought, behave like a kid with someone else's post.
@champa10 @2ndAmndmntDfndr Against all odds: Liberal Democrats can not go this long without Common Sense and not feel Stupid …or can they?
@ProfessorRobo @2ndAmndmntDfndr You may want to ask the GOP and the extreme Right that question, which is where it belongs. Projecting much.
@champa10 @2ndAmndmntDfndr extreme lol lol lol
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  lying small business employers, who will not even be affected by the ACT and keeping staff P.T. Why...More Profits!
@SenMikeLee  #Obamacare is the #Destruction obama's been looking forward to. My sister works 2 jobs, my son has 1 pt job.Can't live on that
@ohululu @SenMikeLee nhs Ecomony has greatly improved from recession.  Businesses using Obamacare as excuse for not paying more & PT folk.

@Michaelsnyder60 @SenMikeLee Oh that is so rich.   I heard this morning Boehner is being investigated for some serious ethics violations
@SenMikeLee @robertbirsinger "My Hrs were cut due to o-No-care "
@robertbirsinger @SenMikeLee "I refuse to sign up for the UnACA & give my SS# & personal info to some possible crook with no background ck "
@robertbirsinger @SenMikeLee "Likewise. My Doctor said if I pay cash, there will be big discount. Cash usually gets discount w/ most HC "
@robertbirsinger "I like the part: spend more time w/Doctor for less $$ instead of Libs way: pay more, longer wait,less time w/Doctor "
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work sen Lee...your one of the few that cares about America and I have to say THANK YOU!!!!
@SenMikeLee @LeahR77 Don't forget the employers that are dropping coverage for employees
@SenMikeLee @texasfreedom101 Oh what a surprise!!!  
@SenMikeLee @rockynickydog 
Yes Sir, It's an Enormous Disaster!
@SenMikeLee    thank you and Sen  Cruz for your stand against obumacare .  Please against immigration reform with the same vigilance.
@SenMikeLee @UreapWatUsow We small businesses can no longer afford to cover our employees and stay in business.  40% increased cost for 2014
@SenMikeLee @Senate_GOPs pass the truth along!!mb_6p_111213 http://www.ktrh.com/media/podcast-michael-berry-show-on-ktrh-michaelberry/michael-berry-11122013-6pm-23964920/ … … dare Republicans in name only to listen
@SenMikeLee #MakeDCListen As evangelical, Christian & Tea Party supporter, am I an enemy of State? Who is watchin the radicals n the WH?
@KolbJoseph @SenMikeLee Most small businesses will not even be affected by Act and if they are using this as a reason to layoff or parttime.
Dear .@champa10 am in a small biz.former plan being cancelled. New plan to comply w #ACA 30% more Boss drops grp coverage gives cash. #truth
@SenMikeLee @LeahR77 Don't forget all the employers that are dropping coverage for employees because of the high costs of Obamacare.
@SenMikeLee  America Used to Offer The Dream Of Liberty-Now It's The Nightmare of Tyranny UnderObama& DC Obamalinskyites That Keep Him There
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Why do they do that, employer mandate is not on yet.
@SenMikeLee jay carney confirms its time to PUNT obamacare it will only make 3 yds a run and NEVER make a 1st down
@SenMikeLee carney said HC like football 3 yds a run that means your PUNTING on 4th down you NEVER make a 1st down time to punt obamacare
@SenMikeLee Continue to protect us from the government
.@SenMikeLee So, employers are cutting people a year in advance? Buahaha. Plus 90+% employers already provide insurance. Overall effect?
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @DefundTheGOP101 Even Ms. Cleo could have predicted this! #ButWaitTheresMore http://ow.ly/q4m44  #Obamacare
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee @DefundTheGOP101 #Obamacare is to the East India Tea Co as Private Health Care is to the Colonists buying elsewhere!
@SenMikeLee Sure are. Son's employer cut 250 jobs this week.
@SenMikeLee That's what obama wants Pain & Suffering so he can blame & slander Republicans & make believe he's fixin it  What a joke
@SenMikeLee obama just wants to ruin the middle class and have more control over everybody's life.that's what liberals stand for
@SenMikeLee @wakeup1442 Welcome to our new national nightmare. Obummercare.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Furthermore, with Obamacare, we've lost our 1st Amendment right to religious freedom! Where'd the Constitution go?
@SenMikeLee @TPMUInc Thanks for LISTENING to #WeThePeople & resisting this #UNConstitutional gov #HELLthContol plan to break #America!
@SenMikeLee @LibertysArmyJr yes, those lucky enough to have a job AND that have money left over from their TAXED TOO MUCH paychecks!
@SenMikeLee @texasfreedom101 did you se 300,000 in FL got cancellation notices?  Incredible!
@SenMikeLee @LilSouthernSass even obamacare call centers can't provide employees with health insurance http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2381502/Obamacare-center-hired-time-employees--denying-healthcare-benefits-promoting.html …
@SenMikeLee #ButWaitThereAreFacts no credible evidence that employers R cutting jobs/hours. Saying something lots does not make it tru!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz That's funny. You just put over 800k ppl out of work for 16 days costing the country billions...
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz "data provides little Evidence forNotion that Health Law is driving a Shift to Part-TimeWork"
@SenMikeLee i agree Senator, this disastrous website is planned distraction! BO is the Dr. of Chaos, no one can be this stupid by accident!!
@SenMikeLee @Ltinsley72 The fight has to be against the LAW! IT'S what's wrong. Private sector people will fix the web site.
@Ltinsley72 @SenMikeLee Haha! You're damn right!
@Ltinsley72 @SenMikeLee People like Linda Blair in The Exorcist I think. These people aren't going to run my life...period.
@Ltinsley72 Thanks for being smart!
@SenMikeLee keep it up sir
@SenMikeLee/@SenTedCruz-#Nigerian's/ REALLY/Where'd u get that from/same dump u get everything else that spills out of your sewage mouth/TPT
@SenMikeLee Less hrs=less $, less $=fewer new businesses, fewer new businesses=fewer jobs, fewer jobs=fewer opportunities.  #commonsense
@SenMikeLee According to Pelosi, We'll have more free time to become professional finger painters. Now, we'll need 2-3 jobs to make same $$
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Keep fighting for America, Go For Broke!!! Ted Cruz. Create a new awakening for all of us.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Reality is a good teacher. The oblivious part of America has to learn the hard way.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz not for nothing but there has been job growth and unemployment nos down. Could u be specific what states, companies?
“@SenMikeLee: #ButWaitTheresMore Aside from website problems & policy MANY DO NOT HIRE50 OR MORE! MORE PHONY INFORMATION! STORY TELLING!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz If your going to gritch about #Obamacare, at least you could be original. And retweeting Ted Cruz? You can do better
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Would one of u 2 call I have a different angle that might help u (us) win this battle
@SenMikeLee @Senate_GOPs That's unrelated to the ACA. We call it... Greed.
@SenMikeLee @Senate_GOPs And employers chose not to hire to keep their employee number below 50. Bigger drain on growth than most understd.
.@SenMikeLee << #DomesticTerrorist ~ By #FBI definition .@Senate_GOPs << #AmericanTaliban
.@mommadona @nicolesandler was just talking to @Frank_Schaeffer on @randiradio's show & he used the term "Jihadists" for the Cruz crowd.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #Obama told you were he was headed! 
http://youtu.be/fpAyan1fXCE 
@SenMikeLee agree we really need to keep an eye on the big picture of what is happening
@SenMikeLee @Senate_GOPs wrong part time hours have been steady since 2008, go look at the BLS stats. It's a lie.
@SenMikeLee the employer mandate doesn't kick in until 2015! Nice try!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Why would we listen to Libs regarding what's good for Conservatives Immigration- ACA-whatever. Do what's best 4 USA
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz ya u guys R the biggest prob.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  Cause and effects. ACA is bad on all fronts, starting with its name.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for fighting!!
@SenMikeLee Its too late for us that our deductibles & rates skyrocketed already got our notices fix that first
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  just found out my health care is going to double. Thanks Obama.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Do you ever supply the names of all these employers?There are 3000 Nevada employers spending thier money against you
Plans being cancelled and having to change plans at the end of the plan year is not having insurance policy cancelled.
Liar -> @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Senator Lee, beyond website fiasco, ACA has not even addressed WHAT PROVIDERS will provide the care and at what REDUCED costs.
Something not mentioned yesterday by #SalesManInChief Obama campaign event in the Rose Garden @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Understand, this is all by design to direct 'health care' to a single-payer program.  Frightening.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz I hope you are ready - WH will press for single-payer system as a fix for their own debacle. #ButWaitTheresMore
@SenMikeLee Very hard to pay for expensive health care, ridiculous deductibles woking less than 30hrs week.  How did Obama think could work?
@SenMikeLee  We the People stand with you, Cruz, Paul, Gohmert, Gowdy. Stay strong.
@SenMikeLee Wow, you'd think Baracks liberals would wake up after #websitegate - I say we impeach #oboma and #defundobamacare
@SenMikeLee I thought the university economists thought that employers wouldn't act in their own self interest this time.
