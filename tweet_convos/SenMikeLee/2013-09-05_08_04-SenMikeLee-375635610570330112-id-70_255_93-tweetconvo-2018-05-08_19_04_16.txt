@SenMikeLee Please stand firm on a NO vote.
@SenMikeLee Thank You ! #stayoutofsyria
@SenMikeLee @fostermomMN -No evidence given to anyone to "PROVE" Assad was responsible for the attacks. Chemicals used does not Equate Guilt
@SenMikeLee @fostermomMN -Any number of Rebel groups in the region may have carried out those attacks including the Muslim Brotherhood

@SenMikeLee @sherrysue66 // so PLEASE VOTE NO! on Strike on Syria
@SenMikeLee @maryannemercog - Your spot on with Ocare but dead wrong on #Syria.  As a DS/DS vet and son w/3 in Iraq.  We speak the truth.
@SenMikeLee Then expect Assad to make the next 6 months make the last 3 years look like a picnic in comparison.On your consciounce be it.
@SenMikeLee #Syria - It's reasoning like this that kred me to vote for you.
@SenMikeLee I hope this will continue to be your stance on #Syria. No US action/involment of any kind!
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU for voting NO on war with Syria
@SenMikeLee @kecurley22265 it's not what you believe it's what WE THE PEOPLE BELIEVE you are a representative  ONLY not a decision maker

@SenMikeLee @seyferjm87 I didn't participate, kinda like Sen. McCain and I don't think we should bomb Syria.
@SenMikeLee Please convince more of your fellow senators to do the same
@SenMikeLee Syria is a sovereign nation and we should not interfere in its internal affairs.
@SenMikeLee For God's sake keep us out of it.

@SenMikeLee Obama is outsourcing our GDP & National security to the enemy! MB infiltrated within DC! War w/ Syria=US Mkt/Dollar collapse!
