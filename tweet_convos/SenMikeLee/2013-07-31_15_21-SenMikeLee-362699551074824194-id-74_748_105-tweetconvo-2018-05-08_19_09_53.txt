@SenMikeLee @CopperBraden We are with you!Thanks for not being afraid to fight this CORRUPT administration!!
Racist calculators RT @SenMikeLee: Georgia requests emergency #Obamacare delay.  Projects 198% increase in premiums:
@SenMikeLee @DavidWebbShow the number of problems already found should tell anyone with any brains that it is going to destroy health care
@SenMikeLee @McdanielDemcdan My disabled neuro patients with chronic diseases like MS will have no prob with rate increases of 199%. 
@SenMikeLee @sheilaaj 198%? Who is going to pay for that monstrosity?? Most people don't have a pot let alone an extra 198%! REPEAL IT!!
@SenMikeLee @restoremerica Sorry GA overwhelming re-elected POTUS because of color not performance. They are getting what they asked for.
@ReporterGreen @SenMikeLee 
Couldn't agree more
@SenMikeLee @tnlawgirl premiums are only a portion of increase; our deductibles (outofpocket) are going through the roof #unitedHealthcare
@SenMikeLee GA projects 198% increase in Premiums with Obamacare @drscott_atlanta @BradMD @JulzMooreWorld @lipstickpundit1 @Rockprincess818
@SenMikeLee @ChristiChat Will @SaxbyChambliss support your vote to defund #obamacare
.@SenMikeLee Shame on u for wanting to take away #ACA patient benefits & protections. No fear of dropped coverage, no lifetime caps. #Kids
@SenatorIsakson @SaxbyChambliss  how can you NOT vote no on cloture 4 this nightmare? #StandWithCruz #MakeDCListen @callmechick @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee #Obamacare is uninsuring the insured, not insuring the uninsured. My very affordable premium trebled 2 B unaffordable, due 2 it.
See 11/6/12 // @SenMikeLee @vmpcott GA requests emergency #Obamacare delay. Projects 198% increase in premiums: http://ow.ly/nvZ4j 
@SenMikeLee @Semperlisto  But that's not good enough! Dems want you to lie dwn, die, so they march ( in lockstep) across you. The patience!
@SenMikeLee I wonder if @Senjohnmccain calls this "hype" too?
#DefundObamacare #GA #AZ #ACA 

Georgia...emergency delay on #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee and this will happen nationwide.  Please stop this in its tracks
@SenMikeLee #Massachusetts has a version of #ObamaCare already in place & their exchange functions very well. #Obama #FoxNews(Idiots) #GOP
@SenMikeLee @Jsue2U We DON'T WANT #OBAMACARE listen 2 the ones that elected U. STOP it-REVERSE IT @MikeNeedham nailed it on Fox this a.m.
@SenMikeLee I've known your mom since she was a girl and your dad since BYU days.  Your mom is so proud of you as we. Keep the pressure on!
@SenMikeLee OC it will destroy small&even medium businesses;Growth potential, annihilated,there4dissipating the reality of The AmericanDream
@SenMikeLee God Bless you Mike and @tedcruz
@SenMikeLee that is completely false
@tedcruz MT “@SenMikeLee: GA req emergncy #Obamacare delay. 198% incr. in premium. http://ow.ly/nvZ4j  #DontFundIt #ObamacareReadingList”
@SenMikeLee Please carry on in this effort, Sen. Lee!  This evil law will destroy our country.
@SenMikeLee congress exempted itself from obamacare, so they don't care about you.  http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/08/02/guess-whose-healthcare-premiums-arent-going-up-next-year-n1654588 …
@SenMikeLee @junipersage1 great. We're a red state so imagine answer = no
RT@SenMikeLee: Georgia req emer #Obamacare delay. Projects 198% increase premiums: http://ow.ly/nvZ4j  #DontFundIt #ObamacareReadingList
@SenMikeLee why isn't the rest of the country on board with you to do an Emergency Delay on #ObamaCare? All Rep. Should unite and follow
@SenMikeLee Republicans/DEMS both supported Devil's work killing God's unborn babies I dare you to learn truth http://www.blogtalkradio.com/luckyr/2013/05/26/best-way-to-hate-a-n-kill-before-born-abortions-part-2 …
@SenMikeLee @Anewhomestar this really scares me
@SenMikeLee You're an idiot & a liar! Go home for good!
Anyone in this administration that is shocked by this needs to be fired  or voted out! .@SenMikeLee @Jaxgy  We read the bill. We knew.
@SenMikeLee I project about a 200% increase in my premiums. Can I get an emergency delay too? Good to end of time?
@SenMikeLee: Georgia requests emergency #Obamacare delay.  Projects 198% increase in premiums: http://ow.ly/nvZ4j  #DontFundIt
@SenMikeLee Where does GA rank in health care & Education? MD is # 1 in Education. Premiums lowered. Move to New York or MD.
@SenMikeLee @thomasj17431826 Unbelievable!!
By what authority can Obama decree the implementation of a law? @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee We are trying to brace for the impact but its really gonna hurt. O care has got to be stopped. Help us!
@SenMikeLee Cannot understand why only 14 senators in your corner. Disgusting.
#DefundObamacare
@defeathemarxist @amendment_guy @SenMikeLee It is because we let them. They are supp to be OUR voice. Yet WE as a nation remain complacent.
@michaelsimmon32 Time for those that don't to be removed from office. @amendment_guy @SenMikeLee
YIKES! “@SenMikeLee: Georgia requests emergency #Obamacare delay.  Projects 198% increase in premiums: http://ow.ly/nvZ4j  #DontFundIt
@SenMikeLee We will not comply. These "navigators" are democrat voter recruiters. More brown shirts. Like #OFA.
@HarrietBaldwin @SenMikeLee Exactly! I wonder if they will come to my home with armed guards?
VERY IMPORTANT STORY! We must get this OUT! It'll effect 49 States as well.... Go GA! @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @NewsNinja2012 wow count me out then , I cant afford the 7000 it would cost me now to aquire insurance just for me .
@SenMikeLee No kidding!! Please keep up the fight to defund this monstrosity. Proud of the work you're doing.
@SenMikeLee @hughhewitt Let the Food Fight Begin,,,time to find out who we are.  No significant change ever occurs until their is a WAR.
@SenMikeLee hmm. California, NY and Maryland getting rebates and seeing rates drop. Mike, who's payroll are you on? 80/20 is working.
@SenMikeLee @hughhewitt #obamacare is the grenade on top of our economic pyramid. Pin's been pulled and now panic sets in!
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks WHEN is somebody with some balls going to step up & STOP this insanity?
@senmikelee  Thank you ,Sen lee for fighting this obamacare !
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks broad, unsourced data backing a partisan position against a bill ratified by all three branches #propaganda
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks obamacare only helped NY bc NYC already had manhattan insurance prices.i do not want manhattan prices for anything
@SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks Must be exaggeration. #ObamaCare will save us $2500 each.  The One said so.
@SenMikeLee all u who approved his signature legislation w/o reading it 1st don't want it now. Bcuz his gr8 Affordable care is unAffordable!
@SenMikeLee I am laughing because it's now too absurd for words only formless noises are adequate responses to this insanity @BlindManMark
@senmikelee Georgia demand to delay Obamacare is suspicious. Isn't BHO planning to make the ACA a political platform for the next election?
@SenMikeLee WE do not want Obamacre, amnesty or the IRS.
@SenMikeLee On October 17, 2013, Steve @Lonegan will be at the U.S. Senate to help repeal ObamaCare!  #TCOT #StandWithRand
@SenMikeLee @Doc_JJK Senator we are with you, defund the entire thing, maybe some day soon Pelosi will get done reading it!
“@SenMikeLee: Georgia requests emergency #Obamacare delay.  Projects 198% http://ow.ly/nvZ4j  #DontFundIt #ObamacareReadingList”
@SenMikeLee @Paratisi Even their numbers are fuzzy as those of us who PAY now have absorbed 100% increases already. Want a revolution????
@SenMikeLee @ReCorwin The entire Republican Party needs unite over this instead of being so Polly Anna...
“@B_radHilton: @SenMikeLee @ReCorwin The entire Republican Party needs unite over this instead of being so Polly Anna...”#ObamaCare
@SenMikeLee 
Sure, when the fed govt gets involved rates always go up. Same with colleges.
@SenMikeLee I guess it's an amazing coincidence that none of the states that support ObamaCare are asking for "emergency extensions"
@SenMikeLee thank you for staying on this. Ignore those old poops like @SenJohnMcCain
