“@SenMikeLee: "This isn't about the person, it is about the principle" NO ITS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION https://youtu.be/  #SCOTUSnominee”
.@SenMikeLee you have no principles. You're ignoring the will of the people that re-elected Obama. Sour grapes is no excuse. #DOYOURJOB
@CitizenFTW @SenMikeLee I think our government all a whole has been ignoring the will of the people for a very long time #LongLiveJFK
@1mJuStSay1nG true, but in this instance its a pretty obvious attempt at ignoring what voters told them when they reelected Obama in '12
@SenMikeLee when the people kick senate republicans out of office in November it will be about both the persons and the principle. Doyourjob
@SenMikeLee <--Thank You for endorsing @tedcruz I hope the jerks you work with aren't giving you a hard time @georgeunangst33
@georgeunangst33 @SenMikeLee @tedcruz <--write in and Mike Lee VP
@SenMikeLee Bullcrap
@SenMikeLee THE principle is #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Please do the right thing and hold a hearing. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee we can't all put our jobs on hold because it's an election year. Please do the job we're paying you to do!
@SenMikeLee Concerned about a principle, yet holding up aid for Flint? It's easy to see what type of principles you live by. Shameful
@SenMikeLee #GOP r expert rationalizers. Machiavellian. True definition of lawless: Selective respect for Constitution. #SelfServing
@SenMikeLee This is about y'all quit w/ the bs excuses & do your damn jobs. WE THE PEOPLE have already spoken, we picked POB. DO YOUR JOB.
@SenMikeLee The principle is the constitution which says advise not block. Hold hearings and do your job or in Nov Republican senate is over
@SenMikeLee The election has NOTHING to do with it. The @POTUS was elected BY THE PEOPLE. #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee - Obstruct through all 8 years of a Clinton presidency? Take the moderate now, while you still have a chance. #GOPinFlames
@SenMikeLee @YouTube wrong! Do your job and let the President do his.
@SenMikeLee #shitmoronssay
@SenMikeLee You'er blocking the #FlintWaterCrisis legislation? Blocking #SCOTUS nomination? Supporting #TedCruz ? #DoYourJob #gop
@SenMikeLee @YouTube STOP FUCKING OVER FLINT
.@SenMikeLee Voters should remember this sentiment in Nov when they vote you out of office. After all, it is about the principle. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Do you job.
@SenMikeLee   You're lying it is about the person. Not the nominee! But the President. Who do you think you're fooling?
.@SenMikeLee What you're doing is the exact opposite of "principle."
@SenMikeLee The Constitution is in jeopardy when the majority decides to ignore it. DO YOUR JOB on Merrick Garland!
@SenMikeLee Don't let politics stop you from #DoYourJob #CountrybeforeParty #FollowConstitution
@SenMikeLee So you have no principles, ignore the Constitution, and ignore historical precedent. Got it.
@SenMikeLee 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsuu43QUnzw …
@SenMikeLee You mean the principle of doing your job? The American people had their voice when they elected the president TWO TIMES.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob Don't try to blame it on "principle" when in fact you just don't want to give @POTUS another justice
@SenMikeLee
Obstruct away, @GOP #SCOTUSnominee #SCOTUS #Hillary2016 #MadamPresident 
@SenMikeLee Exactly!!  How about the principle of following the instruction from the Constitution??
Bull. #DoYourJob #SCOTUSnominee @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee You mean the principle of obstructing the first African-American president any way you can?
@SenMikeLee seems like a dereliction of duty to me.  Isn't the constitution principled enough for you?  #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee What principle? Obstructing every action taken by @POTUS? There are no other principles that are at work here. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Just do your job!  Hold the hearing and approve Obama's nominee.  To do otherwise just shows your racism!
@SenMikeLee you do realize you represent constituents, right? #doyourjob #tool
.@SenMikeLee The principle of ignoring the will of the people that voted in a democratic president for a term of FOUR full years? That one?
@SenMikeLee The people HAVE spoken, you dumb bastard. Twice. #doyourdamnjob
@SenMikeLee #doYourJob
@SenMikeLee  Principle equates to allowing the electorate voice their opinion via elections. #Obama was given that mandate 4 yrs ago.#SCOTUS
@SenMikeLee not an Obama fan by any means but he looks like saint compared to you evil SOB.  Please follow Scalia soon for the USAs sake.
@SenMikeLee Still holding up Flint recovery? #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee what is the principle?
@SenMikeLee Hey, which bank's borrowers were on the hook for the short-sale of your McMansion?#DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee A Fox News clip does not any case help.
@SenMikeLee Please. Most Republicans HAVE no principles.  Don't embarrass yourself.
@SenMikeLee The principle of ignoring your responsibility, of not allowing a president's nominee a hearing. We picked Obama to choose.
@SenMikeLee you mean following the constitution??
@SenMikeLee it is about the people of the US...DOYOURJOB Twice elected president gave you a nominee...earn your $$
@SenMikeLee violates oath of office.This is a "purpose of evasion" and isn't in "true faith." He won't "discharge the duties of the office"
@SenMikeLee You can begin on your own by doing your job on the nomination for the Supreme Court.
@SenMikeLee We the People elected President Obama TWICE. He did his job, NOW DO YOURS! You Senators are worse than a bunch of spoiled kids!
@SenMikeLee it should be about what's good for the country and about doing your job #doyourjobcongress
No, it’s about hate RT @SenMikeLee: “This isn’t about the person, it is about the principle” https://youtu.be/ZYJzl0bKfNw  #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee From a man without principles. Great to be paid for a job and not do it. Aren't you against takers?
@SenMikeLee It's not principle, it's your job.  Do it or stop taking a paycheck from my taxes!
@SenMikeLee It's about abdicating your consitutional responsibility, at this point. Do your job. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee @YouTube  Of not doing your job?
@SenMikeLee no sir it about the constitution! Get a copy and read it!
@SenMikeLee I'm glad your standing up for principals! I'm sure you'd have the same conviction if Romney were Pres? Yeah right. Posturing BS
@SenMikeLee This is about you playing partisan politics.  #doyourjob or resign and return you wasted pay to taxpayers
@SenMikeLee yes it is about a principle- that the voters elected you , on their behalf to give advice and to fulfill your duties as Senator
@SenMikeLee we couldn't agree more. #DoTheRightThing
@SenMikeLee no it's about the Rep blocking everything the Pres does  #DoYourJob  / we are SICK of your bs
@SenMikeLee   Fighting because of the "principle" of a thing keeps courts open and lawyers fed. Have you not a better reason @SenMikeLee ?
@SenMikeLee Idiocy doesn't even begin to describe your "principle" Point to an article in the constitution, not some contrived 1888 bullshit
@SenMikeLee the principal being you will be out of a job next election cycle... YOU do YOUR job !!!
@SenMikeLee obviously you're not a statesman only a far out politician who relishes in chaos
@SenMikeLee If the sitting President was a Republican and he made a nomination you'd DEMAND the senate vote.  So, #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee as a us senator you have an obligation to advise @POTUS on the #SCOTUSnominee #DoYourJob
Attention all US republican Senators you have an obligation to advise @POTUS on the #SCOTUSnominee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Exactly!! We voted for our President and now he is fulfilling he's obligations. Republican's once again hurting our country!
@SenMikeLee So not only will the GOP lose the presidency, but with this latest ill conceived stand, the GOP will lose the senate.
@SenMikeLee what principle is that, exactly? "We lost the Presidency, so now we're going to stamp our feet & pout about it"?
@SenMikeLee Thanks for failing us with partisan obstructionism. #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee As my Senator I expect you to respect the Constitution that you swore to uphold and defend..#SCOTUSnominee
@JaredTSwift @SenMikeLee Not before one is nominated...
@maddogg2463 @JaredTSwift @SenMikeLee  BAM
@SenMikeLee the principle of obstruction at all costs? The principle of ignoring the Constitution? The principle of party over country?
@SenMikeLee hold the hearings! #obstructionists #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @YouTube https://www.createspace.com/5607739 
@SenMikeLee - uh, huh. And "the principle" you're referring to is "the American people are stupid and will believe any #&$?!€£ I invent?"
@SenMikeLee   Do NOT impose your will on your constituency if you seek reelections. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Hey. Hi. How's it going? Do your job.
@SenMikeLee Thumbs up for sharing that tweet. It's now live on my @RebelMouse!  http://rbl.ms/1STbeCY 
@SenMikeLee Resign immediately if you don't want to do your job. We, the American people, should not have to be paying your salary!
@SenMikeLee  Principle!  How juvenile is that.  At least the man could be vetted. You all are forming a huge republican party wrecking ball.
@SenMikeLee @YouTube the principle of abusing power?
@senmikelee You have none!
@SenMikeLee I don't believe that for a second #Obstructionism
@SenMikeLee u bet it is about the principle! Now step up and do your constitutional responsibility! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee @YouTube  then do your Damn Job. Vote yes or no. you disappointment and embarrassment.
@SenMikeLee Principle? What do you know about principle.
@SenMikeLee Do SOMETHING, tell Kasich to get a life, make a scene, get him out !
@SenMikeLee No Mike, its about saving my Social Security !
.@SenMikeLee The principal that it isn't important for #SCOTUS should be split for the next year? I'm your constituent. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee I've supported you since '10.  But this is partisan politics.  Let Prez do his Constitutional duty and do yours w/ vote.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee wait who did u back ?
@SenMikeLee what idiots
@SenMikeLee The principle of blinkered obstructionism?
@SenMikeLee what principle?That Your Black POTUS can't make this appt??but HRC will! Wicked Sin-ators! Lee,McConnell,&All their cronies
@SenMikeLee @JohnCornyn And the principle is obstruction.
@SenMikeLee no up or down vote?????Clearly not principle, what a joke. 

Constitution!!!!!
@SenMikeLee So much for meritocracy.
@SenMikeLee I call bullshit
@SenMikeLee pathetic to put party before your constitutional responsibility. #DoYourJob
.@SenMikeLee Ahh, you must be referring to conservative principle #17: "Piss on the constitution when it's politically inconvenient."
@SenMikeLee Hey Mikey, principle is a weak argument when 1/3 of all US presidents have nominated a SCJ in their last year. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee How about you do the job you were elected to do?!
@SenMikeLee why no tweets to support Cruz and expose Trump???
@SenMikeLee Eloquent reading doesn't change Fact.
@SenMikeLee Principle is not the constitution.  #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee At what point does the "principle" apply? Election calendar year? 18 months before election? 2 years? Why not wait a full term?
@SenMikeLee Your principles are not in line with the Constitution.
@SenMikeLee @YouTube do your job!!
@SenMikeLee We've got your back Senator. You are right he's a leftist on guns. Absolutely cannot fill Scalia's seat.
@SenMikeLee @stangertweets I like you Mike, but I don't agree with your Cruz choice, It's all good though!
@SenMikeLee Damn right it is. This is a lifetime appointment and @BarackObama has one foot out the door. He's looking to stir up chaos!
@SenMikeLee Sen McConnell makes it look like the principle in question is revenge...
@SenMikeLee Principle. Really? Its about the principle of obstruction you set the day after Obama's election. Shame on you all.
@SenMikeLee @YouTube What do U know about Principle. GO TRUMP.
@SenMikeLee Well said. Stand firm.
@SenMikeLee did I miss the revision of the number of years a president is elected for? Last time I checked it was 4, not 3.
@SenMikeLee and SenMcConnell won't approve the SCOTUS nominee because they want the people to decide. Don't they "represent" the people?
@SenMikeLee Ask your constituents what they think, not party bosses.
@SenMikeLee It's about the constitution that the GOP holds so dear only when it favors them. Presidents nominate Senate has hearings/votes
@SenMikeLee The principle of disruptive politics? Great idea? Why not just shut down the government again? That worked out well.
@SenMikeLee is the principle at all related to you not wanting to #doyourjob ?
@SenMikeLee Don't let the Democrats bully you. @StopObamaCourt
@SenMikeLee @YouTube don't you dare confirm anyone until the election
@SenMikeLee the principle that the PEOPLE choose the nominee.
