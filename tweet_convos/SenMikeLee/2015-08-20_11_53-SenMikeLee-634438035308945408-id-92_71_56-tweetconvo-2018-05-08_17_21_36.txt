@SenMikeLee Fire the incompetent, stop the risky acts, prevent them from happening again in the future & set land back to private ownership.
@SenMikeLee Looks like http://tinyurl.com/animas-usgs-data … puts the "spill" starting on Aug.3rd. It takes some time to pour 3mill gallons. Toxic Fishy?
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA we need considerably shrink it's budget reduce to essential 6% personnel
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA Abolish the damnable, unconstitutional org. Return responsibility to the States.
@SenMikeLee In the private sector where most of us have to make a living the woman in charge gets fired. That is a different world than DC.
@SenMikeLee Disband them.
@SenMikeLee the creation of the EPA was done under Richard Nixon as an executive order in the first place and it never should have happened
@SenMikeLee elimintate them.  they are worthless and cost the country too much $$$ anyway
@SenMikeLee The Media does likewise which makes me think NBC, CNN, CBS, and ABC as well as many othe rliberal pundents are the enemy.
@SenMikeLee mothballs
@SenMikeLee Reduce funding to agency by estimated cost to clean & remediate. Funds in special account managed by task force oversee cleanup
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA Fire app. 75% of them.
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA  Is this a trick question? They did it didn't they? But will they suffer? No, we will.
@SenMikeLee shut down funding.
@SenMikeLee The EPA gets on the case of business like a hound but overlook their own failures and inadequacies.  I am grateful for Mike Lee.
@SenMikeLee  by firing the head of EPA. No less than what the environmental extremist demand from the private sector. Taxpayers will pay.
@SenMikeLee defund and dismantle.  It's a shame we can't find a private entity to extort over this.
@SenMikeLee put the EPA on ebay and sell it to the highest bidder
@SenMikeLee put the EPA on ebay and sell it to the highest bidder.  International bidders only let some other country deal with them.
@SenMikeLee How about getting rid of the EPA??
@SenMikeLee cut their funds drastically
@SenMikeLee defund it kill it and let the states take care of their own land
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA I say they should get the same punishment they would give the mining company, had it been their fault.
@SenMikeLee All similar clean up-super fund projects or remediation on hold pending review & verification by outside audit & engineering rvw
@SenMikeLee Replace EPA leadership immediately. Restrict policy implementation unless legislatively approved. All funds on hold pending rvw
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA how about put their asses in jail.
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA Lets's start with shutting the EPA down. Close the doors.
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA Yeah right.  Like Congress will do anything...
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA Fire the hole bunch
@SenMikeLee @andersonDrLJA BY GETTING RID OF IT!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee at the very least someone should be fired
@SenMikeLee I wish you could eliminate the entire EPA along with the IRS.
@SenMikeLee close it down, and take away their pensions!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee They should be privatized so they aren't political puppets like the rest. I personally think they might be excused here though.
@SenMikeLee America's being robbed:

@SenMikeLee Capitol Hill is a mess to much of democracy toxic waste into Animas River whats next with these agencies including fake jews.
@SenMikeLee US Congress should hold EPA accountable for their actions that's a shame. What sick world in today's  society.

@senMikeLee @AnnCoulter @Benz500CLS @realDonaldTrump    The people in this administration are children!  Shut down the EPA.
@SenMikeLee @bchillebrand putting them behind bars would be a good start !
@SenMikeLee Only #Scapegoats r offered & held accountable. The real offenders always walks away clean. #BusinessAsUsual
@SenMikeLee Y ask? Ur fellow senate colleagues will hold no1 accountable. The track record 4 congress holding any1 accountable is atrocious.
@SenMikeLee --disband federal EPA and return jurisdiction to the individual states.
@SenMikeLee 
Make them personally responsible for the cost. Don't let them use our tax dollars to fix.
@SenMikeLee How SHOULD they? Brutally, as the EPA would attack anyone else. How WILL they? ha ha ha ha
@SenMikeLee Defund it, then dismantle it.

@SenMikeLee The funds used for the cleanup should be deducted from their  budget. They made the mess, they should have to pay for it.
@SenMikeLee You ask that as if anything will actually happen. You & every other GOPer will use this 4 political points but u won't fix it. 
@SenMikeLee @SBSportsDiva Pass (and enforce) a statute prohibiting EPA from promulgating any regulation without a vote by Congress on it.
@SenMikeLee Get rid of them!
@SenMikeLee AT THE SAME time stop these industry killing regulations on CO2 and methane. Congress must act B4 thousands more jobs are lost
@SenMikeLee Defund, investigate and prosecute, just like in the real world.
@SenMikeLee That's obvious, increase their funding and promote those responsible.
@SenMikeLee @bakerlarry84 absolutely!!! They've wrecked havoc on business and people, it's time 4 them to be fined 4 their role in this mess
@SenMikeLee @SBSports REALITY! Nothing is going to happen. Congress in its current state is as out of control as the EPA, Article V
@SenMikeLee Shutter the doors...
@SenMikeLee  what is going on in DC? The justice and IRS depts just give you the finger when u have ?. Defund them 10 percent
@SenMikeLee Disband EPA
