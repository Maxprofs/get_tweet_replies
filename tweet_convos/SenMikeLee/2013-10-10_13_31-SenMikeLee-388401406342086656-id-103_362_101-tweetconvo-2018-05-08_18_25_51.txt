@SenMikeLee NO CAVING IN! NO NO NO #dontfundit
@Heis_hooargoo @michelledlamber @SenMikeLee ACA is not healthcare, it's insurance via taxation. Have fun with your free healthcare!
@Heis_hooargoo @michelledlamber @SenMikeLee Andrew, TY for not freeloading! How much do u pay for insurance?
@Heis_hooargoo @michelledlamber @SenMikeLee Good luck w that, might need to clear some ash
@SenMikeLee that is more then have sign up for OBummercare
@SenMikeLee @PolitiBunny Obamacare is how a Socialist and his party of commies force the people to be as ignorant as they too bad were not
Socialism... idea so great you have to force people to take part. smh @TheMickVet @SenMikeLee
@PolitiBunny @TheMickVet @SenMikeLee Socialism...been a great lasting success throughout history...wake up people #EpicFail every time.
@lochlass @PolitiBunny @SenMikeLee Socialism... when you just aren't that good at running a nation.
@SenMikeLee @redmeatmonday The difference is,ur's is just some shitty letter. The latter actually helps Americans. U dickbag.
@SenMikeLee R the 51k Alive&Legal? Didnt know dead voted til lived in Chicago. Didnt know illegal immigrants got TaxRtns til '08 n SanDiego
@SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot Dont Let them Cave. You and @SenTedCruz  are #Leading keep Leading !!! Dont get beat down by "our guys"
@SenMikeLee And I wonder what portion of those who created accounts were #ComDem s?
@SenMikeLee @SenMikeLee @M24Miles "6,200 Americans applied for health insurance" = *created an account* not successfully selected a plan.
@SenMikeLee @PolitiBunny Hang in there!  We're still standing if you are! We must defeat progressive R's and D's for freedom to survive. THX
@SenMikeLee I see you are using the same Twitter Censor that ur BFF Cruz is using. Believe me, NOBODY ever whats to hear from you again.
@SenMikeLee @judyme3 
Good point Mike no glitches there -  makes you wonder if it was on purpose for the single payer plan
@SenMikeLee TY for all you are doing to preserve our republic.
@SenMikeLee To be completely fair, unlike voting you can only sign up once, you must be a US citizen and have ID #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee STAND FAST MIKE !!!! Save Our Country From TYRANNY. Call For The IMPEACHMENT #NSA Violations #IRS Violations #BC FRAUD #ENOUGH
@SenMikeLee Thank you for fighting for the American people.
@SenMikeLee if the ACA is so great then it should be voluntary. Defund Obamacare! America can't afford it and we shouldn't be made to buy it
10k people signed your #DontFundIt  on the 1st day, if only that was a fraction of the people you have harmed @SenMikeLee #psycho #shutdown
Dear @SenMikeLee I am FED UP with the "UNNECESSARY" drama in #Congress that YOU are putting our economy through. STOP IT NOW!! Pass #CLEANCR
@SenMikeLee they have no empathy care only for themselves
@SenMikeLee @neuro7plastic Obamacare is the dead-end to my pursuit of happiness !!
@DwnstaufferDawn @senmikelee 

Unconstitutional!
@SenMikeLee 65 Million voted for Obama.  New strategy please @JTofCaroline
Bipartisan abuse: GOP Congress doesn't exert Constitutional authority to oust Dems who don't abide Constitution. @RPFostex @SenMikeLee
@JTofCaroline I'm only saying that GOP needs votes in 2014, and strategies that will get those votes. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee this would have all been much simpler if the Gov had just applied a $95 tax to all people w/o insurance. @irritatedwoman
@SenMikeLee @irritatedwoman Remember what happened to Bush senior when he caved and raised taxes pressured by D's they tore him to peices
@SenMikeLee @irritatedwoman  that is perfect
@SenMikeLee It's already a law, moron. I think they covered that in law school, right? How a law becomes a law? & the appeal process? Yeah.
@SenMikeLee Here in #California Sign-Ups Exceed 28,000 in First Week!! YAY!
#Obama #ObamaCare #GOP #Congress #Senate Eat your heart out!!
@SenMikeLee

YOU SUCK!! 
How about that?? #House Has Now Voted 46 Times To Repeal Or Dismantle #Obamacare!! OPEN THE GOVERNMENT!!
@SenMikeLee In New York?? #ObamaCare Sign-Ups Exceed 40,000 in First Week!! YAY! 
#Obama #GOP #Congress #Senate

@SenMikeLee how many Fed Employees n yur state affected by yur shutdown? #p2 #tcot
@SenMikeLee @zebra78610 You should track those numbers daily to put back in Obama's face
@SenMikeLee @zebra78610 Dwarfing those signing up for it
@Godndguns  Hopefully the BO Hero worshipers will wake up Before he leaves WH. He and his WH gang are wreaking havoc on USA.@SpeakerBoehner
@SenMikeLee Well if you properly funded the ACA rollout would that have helped?
@SenMikeLee @UreapWatUsow bet 6200 of those 10K were those that have the insurance & realize what it actually is
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater You now have almost 2.1 million and it didn't cost taxpayers 1 cent let along $643 million to Canadian firm!
@SenMikeLee the fact you're proud of trying 2 rip healthcare out of the hands of those 6200 people says a lot about your  "Christian" ideals
@SenMikeLee @BornOnTheBayou9 Mike stay strong #WeThePeople stand with you and @SenTedCruz @ChuckGrassley @SteveKingIA #RedNationRising
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater There are gonna be a lot of surprised people come April 15 next year...
@ellenbutler @SenMikeLee THE 2014 Ocare penalty is 1% of earnings.....not a flat $95...... Yes that will be a surprise.
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater It's funny they report 6,200 sign-ups when nobody can find 62 people that could even log on.
@SenMikeLee  Disagree strongly with your stance on #obamacare. Use your influence to stop the  #TeaPartyShutdown
@SenMikeLee The media's constant drumbeat against you is drowning out the truth. Figure out a way around that or little will change.
@SenMikeLee @KLSouth I signed!  Thank you!
@SenMikeLee Please help us save our First Amendment right to religious liberty! It's demonic to force pro-lifers to kill babies.
@SenMikeLee @lynn_lwrightpcd got an 'impeach obama' form ready?
@SenMikeLee @Saki_Knows U rock! Sen, Lee. Keep up the good fight.
@SenMikeLee and your poll numbers dove 20%
@SenMikeLee And yours doesn't save one life.
@SenMikeLee Stand strong! Stop negotiating against yourselves!  #DefundObamaCare #NoAmnesty #Benghazi
@SenMikeLee RT Things wrong w/ Obama b/c he's BIPOLAR & we R dealing w/a mental case POTUS who's run every Fed agency into the ground!
@SenMikeLee @NewCongress4NE And those wanting it was marching in DC with Pelosi
@SenMikeLee Hey Mike the 6200 stated above are all the dead people that voted for Obama.
@SenMikeLee @mericanrefugee How on earth was your website able to handle all that traffic? /snark
@SenMikeLee 
Just another program to make the poor more dependent on govt thereby voting in a liberal block. 
Imagine 12 million aliens
.@SenMikeLee Tell US the truth, Mike: The ACA is IMPOSSIBLE to comply with (Drs, Hosps) & citizens must revoke 5A rights to sign up; illegal
@SenMikeLee @mericanrefugee We trust you Senator Lee and @SenTedCruz  to fight for we the people.
@SenMikeLee @MercuryOneOC more than what 1-800-F1UCKYO did. Congrats!
@SenMikeLee RT Things wrong w/ Obama becuz he's BIPOLAR & we R dealing w/a mental case POTUS who's run every Fed agency into the ground!
@SenMikeLee Because the people stand with you, not Obama. Thanks for fighting for us.
@SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot Only 330,000,000 to go, give or take... #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee @tedcruz Stay strong. People out of the Beltway are with you both. God bless.
@SenMikeLee  Keep up the good work, Mike!  Conservatives love you!
@SenMikeLee keep up the fight, don't cave like other republicans. We don't need and can't afford more government spending.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee That's cuz you're smarter and more helpful than Obama or Obamacare, with far fewer lies
@SenMikeLee  I just donated $100.00 to senator Lee for his commitment to us Utahan's  Keep up the fight...
@SenMikeLee..With patriots like you getting attacked from both sides of the aisle, why can't morons see they should dump their partisan ways
@SenMikeLee How many of the "sign-ups" were "journalists"?
@SenMikeLee get rid of obamacare
@SenMikeLee Compromise with libs just means we're taking smaller steps to the edge of the cliff.
@SenMikeLee @NetAdvisor Senator, I'm betting you didn't have a $634 million website supporting your signup process either!
@SenMikeLee don't back down
@SenMikeLee @IP4PI it's over guys.  It has been over.  Please go be productive.  Sincerely, most people.

@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @MikeCrapo @Raul_Labrador @RepTomGraves Do what you gotta do to get this done.  Just make sure our Troops are safe.
@SenMikeLee With all due respect, I do NOT believe that 6,200 ppl actually purchased insurance the first day w/ or w/o subsidies
@SenMikeLee we believe in you!! #MakeDCListen... #TruckersToShutDownAmerica
@SenMikeLee What will it take #America 2 pay $17 TRILLION 300 Years if we add NOTHING,will YOU take PAYCUT & give up #PENSION & go on SS
