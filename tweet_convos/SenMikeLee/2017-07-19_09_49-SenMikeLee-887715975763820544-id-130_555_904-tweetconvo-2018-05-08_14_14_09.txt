Maybe Utah doesn't have a problem with drug dealers accumulating large piles of cash, but there are good reasons this is law for 30+ years.
If someone is a drug dealer, it should be easy for law enforcement to prove as much. Why should due process protection not be observed?
It's a system of civil reg. If you're holding it to criminal standards of proof?Just say you want to dismantle financial regulation of banks
Now you are mistaken. Most forfeiture reformers are looking for more modest reforms, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 1/2
That's fine for real lawyers seeking reforms. Not true of most ideologues writing articles or non lawyers on TWTR.
I have no idea what the ideologues or non-lawyers on Twitter say. But you are tweeting all of this at two "real lawyers seeking reforms" ...
Lawyer seeking fair reforms doesn't impose criminal standards on civil forfeiture-you: "If someone is a drug dealer, it should be easy to...
See my previous post re probable cause standard & timing of hearing. Perfectly consistent with idea of "proving" s/o is a drug dealer
"In fact, four out of five administrative civil asset forfeitures filed by federal law enforcement agencies were never challenged in court."
Given that asset forfeiture disproportionately targets the poor, it isn't surprising that most go unchallenged.
So poor person wouldn't go see free lawyer? If you lost $10k and are poor you wouldn't make any effort? Judge would bend over for pro se.
What free lawyers? There are a few who will take these case pro bono, but not many. And we must have had different experiences w/ pro se
And often what people have lost here is property, not cash.  A car; a house. Not like they can split that w/ atty if they win.
Improved Procedures are one thing. Immunizing landlord who allows notorious drug dealing something else. W/o civil ff dealers laugh at cops.
Who is responsible for setting this DOJ policy? Name names and be specific.
Oh golly, where shall we start?
Has to be balanced so u don't end up on side of drug criminals? Who is it that u r worried about protecting with"due process"?
DOJ allowing gov officials to act like criminals. What happened to INNOCENT until proven guilty? We are now guilty until proven innocent!!
IRS, need I say more? Reason why we need to take power back from feds, including entitlements and social issues.
Yeah, because that attitude has worked out so well for red states.

#FactsMatter
Let's see, how many strings can you attach to federal grants? How many fed regs affect those states, either causing the probs or exacerbatin
Advocating failed policies and people doesn't help with anything. Try living in the real world for a day or two, I know it frightens you.
And NY, CA and Illinois are fiscally solvent? I lived in NYC most of my life. Liberal utopia, not! Where do u live?
Yep! 100% of IL taxes go to pay pensions that progressivs promised 20-30 years ago. They voted 2 weeks ago to raise taxes on the working ppl
Reality is too frightening to face, isn't it?
What's next Mike??? Reps are letting Trump and DOJ sell my country out! Lady Liberty weeps!!!!!
I'm blown away right now. It's like the twilight zone. I thought our side fiercely preserves the constitution?  This is Gov overreach BIGLY
What could possibly have hinted that this administration could be a rip-off? This comes so out of the blue... really? #DonTheCon
Mike get off your ass and vote to repeal Obama care, get rid of all the regs and mandates.
Asset forfeiture is about as un american as u can get !
We don't agree w killing Medicare, destroying healthcare for 34 m or Reps that are lapdogs to DJT, Kochs. U attacking Sessions 4 DJT?
You knew who Jeff Sessions was when you voted to confirm him. Talk is cheap, Mike.
Hey Sessions is a Hell if a lot better for this Country than Mike.  Mike's a closet Dem.. Sabotages his own Party.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Police state is up and running!
Take your Tin Hat off cowboy
The cold cash is just too good to pass up & they have been sharpening their meat hooks for some time. Let's call it "Operation Jackpot."
Sen Lee ; How Do We Encourage DOJ To Reform Its Forfeiture Rules?
Don't agree with u on much. But glad to see you taking up this issue. Stand strong.
RICO
Thanks for pushing back!!
WHAT Part "Thou shalt not steal" does @USAGSessions not get?  I put him in with the Lucifarians cause blood is on his hands!

Please direct me to a court that has due process rights..  The local resemblance of such institution is practicing something very different.
Looks somebody is trying to get President Brannon's attention for AG.
DOJ should be all over this....folks like Trump have a lot to lose if found criminally liable.
Personal property rights no longer exist
I called the offices of both @SenFeinstein and @KamalaHarris today and asked them to work with anyone & everyone to end this practice.
How can we believe anything you say @SenMikeLee after breaking your promise to repeal. Thanks to you and sen moron we are stuck w/ obamacare
Look is you want to be a Democratic be one, don't play two ends against the middle,  that's a loser's stategy
So why'd you vote to confirm him? These were always his policies.
Everything and I mean everything CSK and Kennedy said about Sessions was 100% accurate ,but still GOP pushed him thru .
And GOP seems determined to get their asses voted out of office
Seems like congress could fix that . . .
You need to get to work on health care bill now,,,!
Then WHY DID YOU CONFIRM JEFF SESSIONS?
This was not unexpected.
Since it is suspected of being the site in a crime, can Trump Tower be seized?
Firmly Agree with you!!
your party is representative of the corruption! you are to blame by default!
limited use for drug related crimes, trafficking, etc is definitely appropriate. We need more deterrents for drug crimes.
Don't complain & do something abt it. Highway robberies must end.
Thank you for standing up for our civil rights on this issue!
He didn't. He voted to confirm Sessions, knowing he had plans for violation of civil liberties.
#Nullify
#REVOTE
or live w/the consequences.
You're right, of course, but couldn't we just seize a few @realDonaldTrump properties before correcting this misguided policy?
More assets are unconstitutionally seized than are lost to burglary.
So many illegal things going on with the Dems and Lee is worried about this? Lol
Care to list what the Dems are doing that is illegal?
Setting up @DonaldJTrumpJr in the meeting when they were the ones colluding, umasking 20,000 Americans,  etc.
I meant real crimes, not make believe.
Why is @TheJusticeDept @jeffsessions defending @BarackObama ongoing #fraud #theft called #Fanniegate scandal? #usa
Fuckheadmagoo, you will NEVER be on the SCOTUS so give up the armchair legal insights. #MikeLeeisCorruptAF
It behooves Congress to pass fair forfeiture laws, drug dealers & criminals should lose they assets derived from crime AFTER conviction only
if only it were possible to know sessions' view on this before he was confirmed
What we need is something like... a hearing. Yes, yes, some way of vetting the candidates. We'll call it... a confirmation hearing!
#KillCivilAssetForfeiture
Losing Asset Forfeiture cases is a big WIN for The People.
Why are these sick freaks getting away with such blatant unconstitutional action?
You knew Sessions position on this before his confirmation. Why didn't you vote against him then?
Because 1) he has testicles the size of raisins & 2) #Sessions ' overt racist fascism appealed to Mike's own poor character.
wasn't Sessions on record BEFORE you voted him for being pro- Civil forfeiture? You, @RandPaul , @SenTedCruz et. all are all cowards.
You knew his position on forfeiture when you voted to confirm him.
So what are you and your colleagues on the Judiciary Committee going to do about it? Talk's cheap to point of being worthless from Sen GOP.
We will have to fight this locally .. we pay for the police salaries .. not the federal govt ... go to your city council meetings!!!!
More "destroy the state" crap from Bannon, Mike .. what has @GOP signed on to?
Senator, NONE of AG Sessions ideas or positions were secret. You voted to confirm him, did you not?
Too bad you're not in a legislative body with oversight and the ability to write laws.

Oh, wait...
You voted for his confirmation.  He never hid who he is - you own this.
doesn't this assure that anyone who has assets will park them overseas?
Now that you're done wrecking Healthcare you'll have plenty of time to not fix this problem  either
Didn't you vote for Sessions nomination?
YOU CONFIRMED HIM
Is the legislative branch so powerless that your only recourse is to root on the judiciary Senator?
thank you Senator these outrages are an affront to Constitution due process is sacrosanct asset forfeiture must be struck down and kept down
See 2-7-2017 video of Trump w Sheriffs Assoc. decrying need for guilty verdict prior to asset forfeiture. 45 is AUTHORITARIAN. Cares not.
You voted for this guy, pal. Own that shit.
Gotta get rid of those laws entirely. Feels like the actions of a monarchy against the commons.
Thank you for speaking out against a policy that is ripe for abuse.
Congress should put an end to this theft by taking done to innocent people by police more interested in profit than crime fighting.
Good. Take it to court.
Its crazy. His lack of self awareness on this is shocking. Feds trumping states AND lack of due process. Hypocritical & tyrannical.
This is not only stupid, but unconstitutional. What are they thinking? Did someone repeal the 4th Amendment while we weren't looking?
Sir, If i may isn't the basis for this the RICO act? Either way, could it not be addressed via legislation? If so why not try?
Horrible Sessions should not be talking about other's criminal behavior. He is very likely to end up in prison with HIS assets seized. Fool
Do your job Bro...
Wait, you think this wasn't totally expected, given who you guys voted in as AG? 

Are you high?

Cold comfort to citizens with seized assets that cannot be used to pay for attorney.The punishment is the process-even if you eventually win
Winning your court case does not necessarily mean you will have your seized assets returned to you. One of the most un-american things ever.
Do you not see what is happening Senator? We demand answers for being complicit in this charade for too long. THIS IS A DEMOCRACY!!
America is a Constitutional republic ....not a democracy. While similar, there is a distinguishable differences
How about voting yes to repealing Obamacare or are you spinless like other Rhinos!
You need 100% transparency on #BCRA to GOP, DEM, & people of U.S.  You need WOMEN working on #BCRA.  Stop the patriarchal attitude.
You voted for Sessions confirmation. You own this as much as anyone.
Thank you for acting as an American first and not a partisan hack. We notice, we thank you. Fight for our rights
Jeff Sessions is an a hole
You need to DUMP TRUMP before he destroys the country further Pence too cause GOP is ALL gone in 2018-2020
Lose????????????????? What bearing does 'losing' have on DOJ 'adopting asset forfeiture policies???? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Get rid of POTUS. Get rid of them all
In the meantime  -  how many innocent people will have their assets stolen by civil forfeiture
After all #MikeLee in order to pander to the left, you were suggesting a leftist be head of the FBI. Remember that?
I disagree with #JeffSessions on this policy-however they did get support from police-huge so this is politics which is unavoidable
Thugs and criminals.
Wow, Mike Lee is on the right side o an issue for one
This really disturbs me! Come on @jeffsessions we don't do this! Pls speak w/him & #DOJ !
Ahhh yes the pesky constitution getting in the way of AG Sessions. I thought I remember reading he was a lawyer at one point.
Tell em sir!  #gettheelf
It is disastrous! This should not be a left-right issue but something all Americans should opposeâ€¦ Disgraceful at the highest level!
These are the first steps in Trumpâ€™s jackboots.
Yup......very Hitlerian. Will start by seizing the property of deportees.
Are you pleased with Jeff Sessions' policies on asset forfeiture?
Well it doesn't look that way since that's what he's talking about in this fucking tweet you responded to. Jesus h Christ
So why did he vote for Sessions? That's what I'm getting at.
This should not require courts. No U.S. government should forsake due process in the first place. This is an outrage. IMPEACH.

The more the supreme court is used to define our rights, the more it becomes empowered, by the appeal of authority, to take away our rights.
The supreme court has no superiority over the constitution and amendments further limit it's power.

@grammyisabel Senator Collins is correct. Glad she stands for all people. Not just GOP POV
@SenMikeLee Why should the American public have to be troubled by the inconvenience of Law when Commerce can do it faster and easier?
Healthcare bill needs to be voted and passed or all that say no need to resign stop the BS
Let them lose. Constitution is pretty clear on just takings and due process.
Wow pretty rude. Sen Lee is doing his job by the way. A wonderful job 100% @CR
Wow, how we remember............
Iâ€™d be fine with that. At least weâ€™d get a definite ruling.
