@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Hold the line, defund obama care, we all know who's fault the shutdown is, the democrats!
@mefbama @jwbrown43 @SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce I think the shutdown is caused by the house of reps. They are unable to pass a budget. Right?
@hellmart @jwbrown43 @SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce No not true. the president is required to submit an annual budget proposal by February.
@mefbama @jwbrown43 @SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce OK.... but why is the government (that Republicans hate so much) shut down then?
@hellmart @jwbrown43 @SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce they want to fund something most do not want now that they no what is. It is not that hard.
@mefbama @jwbrown43 @SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Republicans don"t eNt to fund what has been signed into law? #disruptive
@SenMikeLee @JimDarcy2 Not until the GOP stands up to Obama and his minions. Stop talking the talk and start walking the walk!
@SenMikeLee @JimDarcy2 In the meantime, over in the House, Ryan is giving the Dems all they want on the trade issue.
