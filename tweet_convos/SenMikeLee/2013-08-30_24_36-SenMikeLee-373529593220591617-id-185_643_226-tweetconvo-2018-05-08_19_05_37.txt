.@SenMikeLee If the report released today doesn't convince you of Assad CW attack, nothing will.
.@gracels Grace even if convinced, why must the US do anything militarily about it. Other Arab states should react with force.
@wowpopwow Yeah, sure, but they're not.
@gracels @wowpopwow they have been killing each other for 1000 yrs.we cant stop that. attacking will not bring anyone back from the dead
@franklazor @wowpopwow No, Syrians have not been killing each other for 1,000 years. Not like this. Not mass murder of civilians with gas.
@gracels Do you remember when San Francisco was gassed as a test for CW? It's not above any society to harm people. The "world" has to react
@SenMikeLee Most of the world has known since 1925 that CW threaten all of us.
.@SenMikeLee Is that the test: whether violation of modern law of war affects us today? That's sole requirement for intervention?
@SenMikeLee And w/o having to convince congress of shit it's off the table. O should get bonus just for dealing w/tea ppl w/o laughing.
@SenMikeLee our final word is we DON'T want obamacare we are the majority obama needs to learn who runs this country

@SenMikeLee If a brutal regime is battling a group of Muslim Jihadists,with an unidentifiable number of 'democratic' fighters,why intervene?

@SenMikeLee what is the purpose of beng the greatest military power on earth if we do not use it for good and for the expansion of freedom??

@SenMikeLee @michelledlamber Obama is AFRAID of Syria, Putin, Iran, Netanyahu, Saudi! He is a FAILURE in foreign affairs!

@SenMikeLee @EricAmey2 Amen.
@SenMikeLee He'll get one if his czar's to order it-or Valerie--or Reggie Love!
@SenMikeLee what ever happened to severe sanctions? #QatarPipeline #NoWarWithSyria
@SenMikeLee - How did Iraq threaten our national security?
History of arms control: Geneva Protocol on Gas Warfare (1925) http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/229055/Geneva-Protocol-on-Gas-Warfare … … #pjnet #Syria @SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty
@SenMikeLee @BigDave74Tex Ummm... Rebels accepted responsibility for that attack. As for Congress, they will agree with O. They DON'T care
@StillLooking9 don't think the house will
@BigDave74Tex I hope not, but also have no hope here. They ALL need to go if they low this
@StillLooking9 if they vote to support the buffoon they should be voted out of office
@SenMikeLee the citizens do not support assinine interventions of this nature. Nor do they trust this administration to tell the truth
. @SenMikeLee Do you want to support the opposition in #syria ?
@SenMikeLee We can't be world's police force.It's a religious war, civil war that's been going on 4 centuries! Let Arabs sort it out@Daggy1
@SenMikeLee @cokeybest it won't, he will just do it anyway!
@SenMikeLee @JoAnnEileen Yes we totally agree! #nowarwithsyria #nowarwithsyria #nowarwithsyria  #nowarwithsyria #nowarwithsyria
@SenMikeLee @toby_dorena if he cant do that, we bettdr impeach him quickly.
@SenMikeLee @FFRNewsNet1 Exactly what makes it a threat to us, do you know? Wondering minds really do want to know!!
@SenMikeLee @Chopine5 everything obummer does is political or as activist in chief. He does not care about true US security.
@SenMikeLee Once he runs out of military excuses, he'll play on your heart strings "For the Children"  Page 31 of his playbook.
@SenMikeLee #Syria Posing A National Security Threat to US is an idiotic & absurd statement right off the bat. Needs to be rethought..!
@GamerOps @SenMikeLee On the other hand WE sent terrorists and US Army personnel to destabilize #Syria. We Are The Threat To Syria.
@GamerOps @SenMikeLee Did Syria come into our country and did anything to any of our ctzns? NO. So Where does the national security Q arise?
Please vote NO WAR ON SYRIA @SenMikeLee @repjustinamash
@SenMikeLee Both sides are our enemies can't Imagine our military fighting for Al Queda That's Treason #StayOutOfSyria
Right @SenMikeLee If POTUS can't convince Congress that Syria threatens our national security, military intervention should be off the table
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 Lose/lose for US. Stay out of this one.
@SenMikeLee @polavenger Since when has OTyrant cared what Congress has to say? Did I miss something here? Impeach him already....
@SenMikeLee You roll up your big boy sleeves and do ur duty 2 evaluate. vocab word: Red line. To allies and enemies, what does it mean?
@SenMikeLee Do you even read the WSJ? Our allies are telling us inaction is dangerous now. Man up and show leadership!
@SenMikeLee @danielcucich how about throwing IMPEACHMENT on the table instead?? Anybody second that????
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 More than our national security to consider, Mike- repercussions from Iran & Syria against Israel Are we ready for that?
#Syria such pressing issue for Pres #Obama he's not calling Congress back from vacation AND went golfing (AGAIN!) today @SenMikeLee #TGDN
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 so true but too many of them in his back pocket..don't trust them any more than i do him. don't feel they care about us.
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 
British News Paper says Bombing Syria makes America Al Quada's airforce:
http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/does-obama-know-hes-fighting-on-alqaidas-side-8786680.html …
Forget the fact it shouldn't even be on the table @SenMikeLee regardless this is not our natl sec issue #NoAmericanBlood 4 #Syria @Norsu2
@SenMikeLee so why aren't you headed back. apparently @SpeakerBoehner want to wait until 9/9. WTG
@SenMikeLee I agree but keep eye on Turkey. They have a role to play in this situation. Syria presents no RAS of threat to us. Stop him
@SenMikeLee Stop him! He is incompetent! As Oliver North said "all this is because Obama shot from the lip" Impeach if he goes w/o Congress
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce Agreed! Time for Congress to reassert itself into process!
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash  Oh 4 politicians who'll lead w. acts of love for the maimed and traumatized Children - not workshops 4 bullies
@SenMikeLee if u haven't publicly requested Boehner call back House from recess to debate  then I'm not listening.
@SenMikeLee False. Should be off table but 90+% Americans want strict gun control & what did Congress do? Nothing! Who cares what they want
@SenMikeLee @Sassy__Britches http://www.examiner.com/article/breaking-news-rebels-admit-gas-attack-result-of-mishandling-chemical-weapons …
@SenMikeLee @Sassy__Britches "Convince"??? How about PROVE!
@SenMikeLee @Sassy__Britches After the youtube video, Fast and Furious, Extortion17, and many more, I don't trust anything from this admin
@SenMikeLee @maggiejaehnig I'd say the muslim brotherhood members in the Presidents administration are more of a threat to us.
@SenMikeLee @blmeek Congress has lost the trust & confidence of THE PEOPLE! U now have 2 work 3 times harder 2 regain that Trust&Confidence!
@SenMikeLee @blmeek Mike is that clear enough now to CONGRESS? You r 1 man I know but a Real Leaders lead!
@SenMikeLee @blmeek the Majority want VoterID Vote accordingly! Do the people's work!
@SenMikeLee @blmeek The Majority want @BalancedBudgets Vote accordingly! Do the people's work!
@SenMikeLee @blmeek The Majority doesn't want OCare in its current form! @DefundObamacare Vote accordingly! Do the people's work!
@SenMikeLee @blmeek Congress works for the People! Prez has to convince the People!
@SenMikeLee @blmeek Mike who do you work for Sir? Ans: The People! The Majority has spoken - No to Syrian military Action! Vote accordingly!
@SenMikeLee Under your test, Bush's invading Iraq and Reagan's bombing Libya should not have happened. Is the U.S. the world's moral leader?
@SenMikeLee @NickEgoroff but a muslim chanting a slogan 'God is the greatest' in some remote corner of the world becomes a US nat sec threat
@SenMikeLee @NickEgoroff ....and then there was #Benghazi
@SenMikeLee @NBCNews poll: 79% of Americans believe President Obama needs congressional approval to strike #Syria.
@SenMikeLee @NickEgoroff and the process of impeachment should begin!!
@SenMikeLee @NickEgoroff Please stick to your convictions!
@SenMikeLee @NickEgoroff AMEN!!!
@SenMikeLee interesting that the party known for leading the charge when it comes to war is so reserved now that its being pushed by dems
@SenMikeLee @dzdork how does #Syria crisis threaten US?
@SenMikeLee @CRODAGNONMAN awkward huh?
@SenMikeLee @CRODAGNONMAN  Israel grant oil rights 2 Cheney, Murdock Rothschild in Syria http://linkis.com/bit.ly/ZrX6#and  Brit Ambassador Craig Murray
@SenMikeLee @CRODAGNONMAN Rove pressuring huh? Rove Romney's and Cheney's bud. Look what Mitt's Bain Buddy Bibi did.
@SenMikeLee @CRODAGNONMAN  66 "experts" pressuring Obama into attacking #Syria: Karl Rove Senator. Lieberman (cont) http://tl.gd/n_1rm6rnc 
@SenMikeLee lame duck Obama looking to go out with a bang? Or will he get his goose cooked.
@SenMikeLee a large Syrian population  emigrated to Australia & NZ. I found out my English NZ relatives are related to Aleppo Syrians.
@SenMikeLee #AP journalist confirms #Saudi Prince #Bandar& #alQaeda responsible for #GhoutaMassacre CW attack!
@SenMikeLee  No, shld be off table anyway; Natl Security threat IF go to war: Regional breakout w/World War involvement. #HandsOFFSyria
@SenMikeLee Hate to give you bad news Obama does not have to go to Congress. I am not an Obama fan just a fact
@SenMikeLee @DanaBordeaux I keep saying it's a trap. Read this http://www.thebrennerbrief.com/2013/08/30/the-big-what-if-in-syria-83013/ … and tell me it's not possible. Of course, it is.
@skshtgr11 Scary
@DanaBordeaux To beat the enemy, you gotta think like the enemy before he does. Too late is too late.
@SenMikeLee @itnasty51 YEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee @Bergg69 #Syria countries that mind their own business, seem much better off all around!
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash You mean like Bush did?
@grackij I’m not a fan of Bush but he did go to Congress. @SenMikeLee @repjustinamash
Should be? How about WILL BE! Do not cut this disgrace of a president ANY more slack! @SenMikeLee @JTthecarguy @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash all Congress has to do is look at all the countries backing out!
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash I'm against #Syria attack. But hard to reconcile #GOP skepticism w/ Clinton & Obama w/ partisan support for W.
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash I thought Libs were Diplomacy first (ahem, only) sorts of people? Why war? To help Muslim extremists naturally.
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash So when's the vote in Congress?
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash make sure the vote reflects such!
@senmikelee @jamilahanan Agree. The time will come when those responsible for atrocities on both sides will be brought to account.
@SenMikeLee thankyou, you are right. And here is 10 more reasons why to say no to war with #syria http://jamilahanan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/10-arguments-for-your-member-of.html … thx 4 reading
@SenMikeLee Congrs told T Roosevelt same thing. He sent Navy 2 Manilla &  told Congress it was up 2 them 2 bring (send money) Navy back
@SenMikeLee #Syria True regardless of which president or party affiliation.
@SenMikeLee I don't think Obama cares what congress decides. He said HE hasn't made a decision on what to do with HIS military.
@SenMikeLee Obama risks US missiles shot down by Russian intercepts over #Syria. Element of surprise is gone. The USA will retreat in shame.
@SenMikeLee Don't you love how he "needs" the UN's permission, but won't go to Congress.
@SenMikeLee @goodinohio Please stand against this. Where is all of Congress? Many questions#Benghazi. Prez not honest!
@SenMikeLee @iworkiron Then stand up to this #Dictator #Obama and shut his agendas down Do not allow him to go around #Congress #tcot
@SenMikeLee / follow me Mike!
@SenMikeLee Why?! Cos this is debating society issue?! If can't figure that out, what's point of being in Senate?! No political shenanigans!
@SenMikeLee You and the rest of your feathered, ball-less, hypocrite Congressmen are Neville Chamberlains in the flesh. You all disgust me.
@SenMikeLee Yes. Keep telling the truth! More human atrocities & greater threat from N. Korea; why is Obama not threatening them?
@SenMikeLee That does make sense.  Something administration  doesn't understand!
@SenMikeLee but you're okay with them killing thousands with chemical weapons?
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl Why hasn't Congr/Sen called themselves back into session while O has us on brink of WWIII
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl What if Egypt decides to close Suez? Are our ships sitting ducks? Who wrote3 the plan?
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl Did anyone ask what happens if Assad Russia, China, Iran decide to retaliate and what that might look like?
@SenMikeLee shouldn't be too hard. Those idiots believed that Saddam was responsible for 9/11. There isn't a single brain amongst them all
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl Obama isn't destroying chem weapons. He isn't saying remove Assad. So what is the expected outcome?
@SenMikeLee @JonathanCohn Ugh, Obama has me agreeing with Mike Friggin' Lee #lonelyprogressive
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl Have you considered the possibility Assad, Russia, China, Iran may not sit still and let Obama bomb Syria?
@JoAnneMoretti @SenMikeLee @orngbrl add North Korea to that mix.
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl What is the objective in Syria, other than to appease Obama's bruised ego?
@JoAnneMoretti @SenMikeLee @orngbrl yep
@SenMikeLee @orngbrl Kerry said Admin knew in advance. Didn't strike then! Obama said Assad violated International NORM. A NORM?
@JoAnneMoretti @notalemming @SenMikeLee @orngbrl Interestingly, #Syria is not signatory to Chemical Weapons Convention.
@SenMikeLee Not one more drop of American blood. We lost our honor in Benghazi. More blood will not get it back. Who will we leave here?
Congress=coequal branch w/ exclusive war-making power. @SenMikeLee, what will y’all do, beyond strongly worded statements, to reassert that?
@senmikelee If this jackass goes into to Syria even with a Pea shot from a slingshot he should be IMPEACHED.
@SenMikeLee How can he if  you're on vacation??   Who is stopping you from coming back and representing WE THE PEOPLE if he won't..
@SenMikeLee Can't convince them if they're not there.
@SenMikeLee how about making this Conservative's holiday weekend by following back. #StandAsOne
@SenMikeLee think calls to the military to not support are in order! military has duty to protect the constitution! #syria
@SenMikeLee Since when has this president cared what Congress thinks? We must pray!
@SenMikeLee -I agree but Obama's selfish pride is on the table here and the only real reason why he's insisting on attacking Assad.
@SenMikeLee I agree. Not a partisan issue. So, are you going to insist on this? Take to the Senate floor & dare leadership not to join you?
@SenMikeLee Please make sure it happens please....no more war !
@SenMikeLee he will not because he believes he is all powerful and has contempt for congress!
@SenMikeLee Totally. Just like Aushwitz didn't really affect National Security™ and we ignored it.
@RepubliGAL @SenMikeLee - At Aushwitz however we knew Hitler was responsible..no hard proof yet to verify Assad responsible for attacks.
@RepubliGAL @SenMikeLee -Why do you think the UN investigators were sent in to gather evidence to assert who's responsible.is Obama psychic?
