@SenMikeLee @Catballou Which Congress has been doing since SS first introduced.
@_Orwell @SenMikeLee indeed. The younger peeps may not know this.
@Catballou @_Orwell @SenMikeLee Why would a guy who thinks SS is unconstitutional demagogue like he cares about it? 
#perpetualoutrage
@randiego2 @_Orwell @SenMikeLee it matters to me.
@Catballou @_Orwell @SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee @YvonnePandaFan The US Senate has ceased to represent the American people. @mitchmcconnell_ @HarryReid #Corruption
@SenMikeLee - We know, Senator, we know.  We are thankful there are a few in Congress not bought, you being one of them. @GenGSPatton
@SenMikeLee @YvonnePandaFan At least we paid 4 that $43M defunct gas station in Afghanistan & billions in fraudulent Obamacare claims.
@SenMikeLee http://crfb.org/blogs/fiscal-factcheck-third-republican-debate …
@SenMikeLee just reposted that on my @RebelMouse http://rbl.ms/1Tcz21U 
@SenMikeLee strange how it matches the dollar amount that Kerry and Obama want to send to Iran. #itwasalreadyspent
@SenMikeLee @realDonaldTrump This Congress goes along with Obama's.agenda to bankrupt America.
@SenMikeLee AND WHOS IN CHARGE OF THE SENATE...WEAK ASSES
@SenMikeLee @anna12061
OBAMA & CONGRESS STEAL SOCIAL SECURITY LIKE THIEVES!
THEN TAKE COLA RAISE FROM ELDERLY TO PAY FOR THEIRS!

VOTE TRUMP
@SenMikeLee @anna12061 King Barack and Michelle Antoinette have more billion dollar vacations planned or what?!?!?  #tcot
@SenMikeLee , they hate SS so much everytime "we close our eyes" they borrow more money, what if it wasn't availableA$$HOLE$ #NO BORROWING
@SenMikeLee senate are thieves and robbing scum! We give billions to our enemies and our vets and old people have nothing!
@SenMikeLee About the same amount stolen from GSE's. #fanniegate when gov went criminal and now looking like Russia.
@SenMikeLee earlier this year when we were awake you, @RandPaul and @SenTedCruz voted for McConnell for leader

that's why SS raid occurred
@SenMikeLee The measure passed by the Senate is to transfer funds from the SS Retirement fund to the SS Disability Insurance Fund? Comment?
@SenMikeLee thanks for no response !
@SenMikeLee Why use words like "steal" when talking about what is legal and routine?
@SenMikeLee @GarciMeyer How thoughtful!
@BobOLilly snakes in the grass!
@SenMikeLee This has to stop.
@SenMikeLee Thank God your fellow Republicans are in charge, so that this sort of thing NEVER happens!
Wait a minute; they did what? 
@SenMikeLee @Dc37Deborah from a trust fund that doesn't even exist!
@SenMikeLee @dwthompson1945 That is not right!! When will we wake up & toss those criminals out of the senate??? I can t do it alone
@SenMikeLee @Psysamurai33317 there is no money in the same fund. It was spent long ago. There are only ious in it
@SenMikeLee Thieves!
@SenMikeLee @MAPires1959 senate doesn't work when I am sleeping
@SenMikeLee decisions such as this by our elected officials is what will ignite the next known revolutionary war.
@SenMikeLee @1bigbeer He meant to say "another 150 billion," and we Seniors are told that the system is going bankrupt on its own, magic.
@dwthompson1945 @SenMikeLee our kids better plan on working the rest of their lives
@SenMikeLee @1bigbeer there has never been a social security trust fund
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee With an 11% approval rating & 63% of GOP voters saying GOP betrayed them Rino congress doesn't have to worry about being blamed.
@SenMikeLee "We'll be Blamed" GOP will always have an excuse for waving the white flag, kicking the can & surrendering to Obama the store.
@SenMikeLee Rino controlled congress doesn't work 4 voters paying their bills i.e GOP traitors work for donor class, ILLEGALS & Obama agenda
@SenMikeLee TRAITORS GOP. Rino budget deal selling out bankrupt taxpayers gave Obama more spending than Reid/Obama budget. GOP 2016: D.O.A.
@SenMikeLee @BobEstesPGA Oh I guess congress, senate, potus don't participate in social security. #TERMLIMITS #noretirement
@SenMikeLee @BobEstesPGA HOW IS THAT LEGAL? NO HONOR AMONG THIEVES FOR SURE!!
@SenMikeLee @TeaPartyExpress Trish Regan owes #RepLouisGohmert an apology and should not be on a debate team questioning Rep. candidates
@SenMikeLee @TeaPartyExpress - but the tea party wants to destroy social security, correct.
@SenMikeLee @TeaPartyExpress why didn't this mention it?
@SenMikeLee @BobEstesPGA I'm surprised it has that much in it!!
@SenMikeLee @TeaPartyExpress Well, Chris Christie said it's no longer my money, so #WhatDifferenceAtThisPointDoesItMake
@SenMikeLee @TeaPartyExpress terrible news for us 40 somethings #notthe1stime
@SenMikeLee @AmericanHeart5 exactly why we need @GovMikeHuckabee who is the only candidate concerned about this! #ImWithHuck #SocialSecurity
@SenMikeLee @heifer109 i have no faith in that ponzi scheme anyway
@SenMikeLee @SharonMcCutchan You cannot penalize those that paid into ssdi and are disabled...that part of the deal was good
@SenMikeLee @DesireeAaron The Senate should have to give it from their pay! They are all thieves in the night!
@senmikelee Fire McConnell NOW!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee By pretending the money is actually there?  Great trick! 
Spineless!
@SenMikeLee Why can't @RandPaul get more support? Because the @GOP is for a big government like the dems. They need to follow Paul's lead.
@SenMikeLee  thank you for trying,  any idea how we stop the madness?  We have an out of control spending problem
@grandlinda3033 @SenMikeLee The "Power Of The Purse" Rino controlled congress selling out landslides 2010/2014 have the spending problem.
@SenMikeLee They didn't even have to use a gun!
@SenMikeLee Sounds about right. I'd like to same I'm shocked,but I'm not. Actually,none of us are. We've come to expect it.
@SenMikeLee  tell Mitch, McCain and Lindsey to keep up the great work!!!
@bmartinbb @SenMikeLee Well that is the nail in Lindsey coffin.. BYE FELICIA
