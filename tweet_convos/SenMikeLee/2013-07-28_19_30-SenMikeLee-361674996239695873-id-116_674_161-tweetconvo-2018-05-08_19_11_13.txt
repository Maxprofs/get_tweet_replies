@SenMikeLee Obamacare would not be unpopular if your side told the truth. You started with death panels.
@gracels @SenMikeLee Wake up gracels!  We are not on SIDES. We are Americans seeking truth and what's best together. Sheesh! #partisan
.@thevavorg @gracels she just can't wait to be in line months for a doctor as treatment & physicians are rationed
@Shawn_Mize @thevavorg Bull. Doctors will come to meet our needs.
@gracels @thevavorg because they'll toss out all profit motive of course. The law of supply and demand can't be dismissed with a wink & nod
@Shawn_Mize @thevavorg Not sure I follow. If demand rises, so will supply. What could be more free enterprise?
@gracels @thevavorg drs don't grow on trees, nor do MRI machines. Prices help ration them. But now lines will do so (re: Canada & UK)
@Shawn_Mize @thevavorg We don't apply that rule to anything else. If there's more demand, we produce more.
@SenMikeLee    I WILL SUPPORT YOU IN ANY WAY IF YOU WILL help us defund, replace and repeal Obamacare.  It is the quintessential curse
@SenMikeLee @AndrewLuck23 yes we are seeing as how it's mandates are going to cost us work hours, take our present coverage etc. not good
@SenMikeLee I agree we should give up on #obamacare, instead everyone should get the same awesome insurance you get.  How's that sound?
@SenMikeLee @ladynra1 .. just dont buy it
.@SenMikeLee @jacobson_martin .Dems want 2 make Obamacare so hard on people that they'll scream for single payer/public option. #DeathPanels
@SenMikeLee @dgoates We're NOT asking, Mike. We're DEMANDING! This is OUR America & we're taking it back. Gotcher back, Buddy! Thanks!
@SenMikeLee @cokeybest Senator Lee, we are not just asking, we are BEGGING our representatives to repeal this monstrosity.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Nope, Mike! We're actually asking for IT! WE, the people voted for it. You and your piers must make it work more efficiently!
@SenMikeLee @stephan96391239 You are doing the ppl's work- so where is GOP leadership & why has party waited so long to make a last stand ?
Calling on All Patriots Help @SenMikeLee to Defund obamacare. This Law will be the Death of America! It's Now or Never!
@SenMikeLee Oh please do and get rid of Obama while you are at it! No sides--can't abide usurper of oval office and his TERRIBLE policies
@SenMikeLee @gracels drs aren't being made at rates needed because they know they won't be allowed to make much money, plus over-regulation.
@SenMikeLee "Obama's Affordable Care Act" Is neither Affordable or Caring, However It is Obama's!  Keep reminding  voters who owns this mess
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater No offense but I think too many people in this country are too stupid to ask for protection.I hope your right.
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater Above person proves my point.
@SenMikeLee @divingnut Sen. Lee American people should ask to be protected from this president. Ignoring checks & balances alters democracy.
@SenMikeLee http://www.dontfundobamacare.com/-listened  2 Ted Cruz tonite;emailed/FB & twitter-SIGN the petition,call UR congressman/senators. NO $ 4 O-care
@SenMikeLee NO! OBAMACARE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL! WE DEMAND RESPONSIVE REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL FED GOVT & TRIALS 4 THE WHITE HOUSE ADMIN
@SenMikeLee @souperfan2012 You got that right Sen. Now convince the rest of the GOP to man up and admit it.
@SenMikeLee @sherrysue66 Most working American ppl can't afford this law-rates/copays/prescriptions are all increasing because of Obamacare
@LauraMarklin @SenMikeLee yes, very true!
@SenMikeLee You Sir, are totally UN-Authorized to Speak for American People.  You are Anti-Americans!  Self-Serving Loser, so #Teaparty #KKK
@SenMikeLee @littlebytesnews Thank you
@SenMikeLee @welshman007 thank you for taking a stand Senator! Insane more don't support this!
Too bad they elected the guys that passed it. RT @SenMikeLee #Obamacare: The American people are asking to be protected from this law.
@DaleFranks @SenMikeLee And funded it.
@SenMikeLee @amgrassroots #Obamacare. Kill it dead Dean Heller NV my Senator cannot be trusted anymore. Was a good guy now a globalist.
@SenMikeLee bullshit
@SenMikeLee @EmfingerSScout  Was told by Anthem policies will increase at least 40% in Virginia come Oct.-middle struggling already!
@SenMikeLee The People ask to be protected from you!
@SenMikeLee The American people shouldn't have re-elected Obama if they didn't want this law. What did they think would happen?
@SenMikeLee 45 lemons stopped background checks, but that won't stop us. #Lemons2Lemonade #MomsDemand
@SenMikeLee @AndrewLuck23 BEGGING to be protected. STOP holding symbolic votes for repeal. Now is the time to do something real.
@SenMikeLee @AndrewLuck23 Since Obamacare is a "trainwreck" and the American people hate it, Obama should be thanking you not fighting you.
“@SenMikeLee #Obamacare is not controversial it is despised. The American people R asking 2B protected from this law http://ow.ly/np2is 
@SenMikeLee Senator Lee, two questions: 1) What, exactly, is the source of your misinformation? 2) Why do you disdain the American people?
@SenMikeLee only unpopular in red neck areas where people have#TeaTRASH for reps and listen to fox and freaks #lie
@SenMikeLee @kksheld If Americans haven't rushed the Congressional building yet I don't know what is the matter with them, gone yellow Igues

@SenMikeLee Tomorrow, anniversary of Medicare. Today, #Obamacare helps more than 6.6M seniors save on prescriptions: http://OFA.BO/Sua24h 
@SenMikeLee #ObamaCare working in Maryland, cutting costs, delivering care. You saying Utah is incompetent?
@SenMikeLee @OCAmericans Is despised because it was push thru without popular or partisan consent and has favoritism written all over it.
@SenMikeLee @OCAmericans hoping that so many of us go galt that we crash the system
@SenMikeLee .  Just signed your letter.
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 Senator; You have the full support of the #TeaParty to stop #Obamacare. Millions are backing you. WE can help!
@SenMikeLee No disrespect, but what planet are you on? Speak to the base, not the rest of us. We're "most Americans" & we support Obamacare!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 Let the dems own it. Reform it in 2016.
@SenMikeLee In conjunction, IMO, WE THE PEEPS shld hold own vote by stats PLUS citizen grandjuries in ea state2force action.
#tpnn #teaparty
It is also epically flawed and unviable. RT “@SenMikeLee: #Obamacare is not controversial, it is despised." #repeal
.@SenMikeLee Stand strong Mike!! Thank you for actually doing something to rid America of this despised legislation! #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee @JamieGator Looks like we'll be asking away - too much money is passing hands from the K St lobbyists to Congress and the WH
@SenMikeLee @fitzfam2000 This R won't vote for any R that votes for Immigration or to fund/repeal Ocare! I will work hard for term limits!
@neonyorkie @chazmoch @SenMikeLee @fitzfam2000 Me, too.
@SenMikeLee @joethepatriotic "O"care gives Gov't all kinds of rights and deny the citizens of Americans theirs! Better listen up America!!!
@SenMikeLee @joethepatriotic "O"care gives Gov't access to your private bank accounts and make electronic money transfers w/o ur permission.
@SenMikeLee @joethepatriotic "O"is using Patriot Act to allow DHS to look into your safety deposit boxes and take what they want!Beware!!!
@SenMikeLee @joethepatriotic Defund Ocare It's a fraud! It's not just a"HC" Bill. It's a Tax Bill. Gives Gov't legal rights to steal frm you
@SenMikeLee @FredZeppelin12 Unfortunately, your Senate colleagues don't know or accept this truth.
@SenMikeLee @Kerryepp FFS  US only countrty in World w 4$$HC--it doesnt work--check the WHO stats on HC  results from rest of world
@SenMikeLee @noprisoners1 @SpeakerBoehner repeal or defund #noobamacare
@SenMikeLee No one as ignorant as you should be in the U.S. Senate. GOP trying 2 "govern" with fear & lies. #GOPFail
@SenMikeLee more than a fool, you are a liar. May God show no mercy on your damned soul. Burn in Hell, but have a nice day!
@SenMikeLee @WDTnow   Shouldn't you focus on the TAX INCREASE aspect of it? It's a TAX according to the USSC.  It's a HUGE tax increase.
@SenMikeLee #DemCare ~~they made it, didn't read it & passed it anyway. #WeThePpl remember 2014-16 ! #DontFundIt !
@SenMikeLee @WDTnow It really will ruin us completely...so un necessary
@Amyloukingery @SenMikeLee Oregon, first to jump in, officially defines alcohol abuse as more than 1/woman, 2/men/day. OHIP:2011-2012
@SenMikeLee @3Quarters2Day And if you clowns don't abolish it, there will be insurrection
@SenMikeLee Mike,don't let them intimidate you.Those against U need a reality check & a brain transplant. U R the ppl's voice SPEAK OUT
@SenMikeLee you have government healthcare.
@SenMikeLee @JimNAcworth personally i'm looking forward to the exchanges. it's about damn time someone did something about our failed system
@SenMikeLee   your effort to defund - stupid, absurd!  From an anti ACA conservative.
@SenMikeLee @DinahSchoen We are DEMANDING to be protected from this #phony #potus
@ladydshops @SenMikeLee I agree 100%! We must stop this phony POTUS!
@SenMikeLee @vannschaffner An enigma.
Just throwing this out here, (Former Adviser to Presidents.) Maybe your people should get a hold of @RealAlexJones @SenMikeLee @mlong42947
This entire illegitimate seizure of control of the American Landscape and Her Citizens is despised.  @SenMikeLee @mlong42947
@SenMikeLee @teaparty321 CORRECT!!!! I donated and signed petition tonight!!
@SenMikeLee pls. Speak to your friends in the house. If we do not defund now it will be too late
@SenMikeLee @LindaArmijo STAND YOUR GROUND!
@SenMikeLee even the #IRS employees are fighting #Obamacare. I'll accept it when the Obamas sign up!
@SenMikeLee @DonnaBee511 No more delays....DEFUND #ObamaCare NOW!!! @JohnCornyn @PeteSessions @GOPLeader @GOPWhip @SpeakerBoehner NOW!
@SenMikeLee It is not despised. While it has flaws- due to GOP mandates- at least it is something trying to help people. What do you offer?
@SenMikeLee IT IS INTRUSIVE TO OUR GOD GIVEN, CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOM.
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work. RINO's better vote to not fund!
@SenMikeLee Do residents of  California, Oregon, Washington et al. despise Obamacare? http://ow.ly/noWyP  #CheaperPremiums
@SenMikeLee Hang tough! Obamacare needs to go the way of the trash heap!!
@SenMikeLee I love to hear a politician talking like a patriot who is trying to defend the greatest nation on the planet! #fighttyranny
@SenMikeLee I sure hope my Senator doesn't depend on FoxNews for a clear bipartisan understanding of issues. That is not the FoxNews agenda,
@SenMikeLee stand strong senator Lee - thx
@SenMikeLee I never thought I'd live to see the day where the majority of citizens are battling against the govt that belongs to us.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for caring and fighting for us. It's good to know there are still a few that care about DC destroying our lives.
@SenMikeLee This is a disaster. So if you politicians REALLY care about the USA and the people you'd mobe swiftly. I have used all I have to
@SenMikeLee just #impeach this bastard please.
@SenMikeLee If a topic sounds so one-sided and simple, then half the facts are being suppressed or misrepresented.
@SenMikeLee Do the uninsured despise ACA or those with pre-existing conditions or those approaching cap limits? You and Tea Party suck.
@SenMikeLee Actually, we need to be protected from the entire -----ing govt. these days. Oppressive by intimidation.
@SenMikeLee respectfully, you may not like it, but the American people spoke about their feelings for the law when we reelected #Obama
@SenMikeLee SB 744 Is despised too. "We The People" have said loudly that we do not want amnesty yet It Is being shoved down our throats too
@SenMikeLee Yes! Yes we are! @SenPatRoberts @JerryMoran @CongHuelskamp
@SenMikeLee I'm an American AND someone you're supposed to represent. Please stop fighting the inevitable. Obamacare is a great thing.
YES RT @SenMikeLee #Obamacare isnt controversial, its despised. American people asking to be protected from this law: http://ow.ly/np2is 
@SenMikeLee It is THE WORST legislation to ever come out of Washington DC.  Why @johnboehner refuses to defund it blows my mind
@SenMikeLee  thank you
