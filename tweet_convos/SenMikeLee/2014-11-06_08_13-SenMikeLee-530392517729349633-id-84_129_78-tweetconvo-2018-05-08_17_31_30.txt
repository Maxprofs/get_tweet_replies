@TonyJohnIII If I don't have time to read a bill, my default vote is "no."
@senmikelee I hope you can implement that.
@mattjbatt I will work hard as hard as I can to make it happen.
@senmikelee I've got faith in you - keep up the good work.You're one of the few good guys.
@SenMikeLee w/ House & Senate @GOP better put US Citizens, VETS, jobs & border security 1st, NOT illegal aliens. #AmericaSpoke #NoAmnesty
@YesAllThis4Flag @SenMikeLee Infidel, somehow I don't think u need 2 worry...The way Reid & the Dem party jerked the (R's) around, PAYBACK !
@BluSthil @SenMikeLee Hope you're right & @GOP does not compromise & has the courage/ balls to stand tall & fight for America's sovereignty.
@YesAllThis4Flag @BluSthil @SenMikeLee @GOP  If they don't, it will be a cold day in Hades before they r given the chance to govern again !
@SenMikeLee  Pls defund 'Truthy' TAX PAYER funded BHO hiring ppl to troll TwitterVerse to confront LIES ( assume as they see them! ) Thx
@BettyeBear @SenMikeLee ANY use of Govt Resources for Political or Personal purposes is a CRIME in every state. CHARGE+ARREST Them
@UnitedCitizen01  Sure, as with lawlessness in this admin, we'll never know exactly who approved 'Truthy' so no one 'guilty' @senmikelee
@BettyeBear @SenMikeLee A FOIA like Judicial Watch does,can Reveal.
@UnitedCitizen01  Excellent idea (what would US do without @JudicialWatch )  same for Mike @senmikelee & Ted @SenTedCruz  Trust in them
State power needs 2 b reestablished. The 17th Amendment needs 2 b repealed. @SenMikeLee @FDRLST
@JJPatriot @paphotog @SenMikeLee @FDRLST Why? If 17 is repealed then governors appoint Senators. How does that establish STATE power?
No. Appointed by State Legislators. Senators would b accountable to the State. @AklamJor @paphotog @SenMikeLee @FDRLST
@JJPatriot @paphotog @SenMikeLee @FDRLST I was around when Senators became elected. It changed because "Good Ol' Boy Network" made senators.
@JJPatriot @paphotog @SenMikeLee @FDRLST Senators were responsible to their pals & not the people. Lots of abuse & pay backs.
@SenMikeLee We the People want to see "clean" bills, no more shoving things in last minute that do not pertain to the reason for the bill!
Great ideas “@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke: http://ow.ly/DVBbW ”
@SenMikeLee No omnibus anything!
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin @FDRLST term limits will build trust fast,  zero retirement and fixing the VA should be priority #1!!
#AmericaSpoke. We want a simple flat tax across the board for individuals & corps, no exceptions, write-offs or loopholes. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee I appreciate the reasonable tone of these initiatives.  Time to get to work :)  Consistent, incremental progress succeeds.
@SenMikeLee Love your plans. 
-Balance budget in 10yrs
-No increases in taxes
-Repeal #Obamacare 
#AmericaSpoke #tcot #gop
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin @FDRLST pass one page, one issue, plain language bills w/ no riders, attachments or additional spending.
@SenMikeLee It would be nice to have a simple flat tax across the board for individuals & corps, no exceptions, write-offs or loopholes.
@SenMikeLee That penny-plan on spending sounded promising. Combine that with informed and targeted cuts.
@SenMikeLee Senator, I'm sure you heard polite applause when you gave that speech, but I didn't see any passion in it.  Core beliefs?
@SenMikeLee we stand with you! #AmericaSpoke #PJNET
@SenMikeLee, oh, & can we, please, have #NotMcConnell as our Majority Leader? He is way too elitist/big government/status quo. #AmericaSpoke
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin Also, though, let's make sure Congress defunds Obama Care while replacing. No funding for unlawful exec orders!
Must read!“@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke: http://ow.ly/DVBbW ”
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin @FDRLST when the GOP stops blaming Obama for their own ineptitude that will be the day you start to govern.
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin One more thing: NO MORE, SIGN IT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT IS IN IT. NO BILLS WITH THOUSANDS OF PAGES. Clear & concise.
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin #Americaspoke Ensure that each member of both houses please the people they serve, rather than power brokers
@SenMikeLee, thank you. I don't think we need ten years to balance the budget, but thinking big & killing cronyism is good. #AmericaSpoke
@SenMikeLee ....Congress should only fund 'reformed' programs. 
#AmericaSpoke
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin @FDRLST Every republican, conservative and libertarian should read this document ASAP. Good roadmap yourself!
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin @FDRLST Great job Sen Lee I just wish new bills were written as clear and concise as your proposal.
@SenMikeLee Its time for Congress to reduce or shutdown US Dept. of Ed.  The record proves states can do it better and at lower cost!
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin #AmericaSpoke Could we focus on lowering the debt and finding areas of wasteful spending to cut? No new programs
@Chaaluna @SenMikeLee @michellemalkin and #RepealObamacare
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin Good plan; lets make it work and not be PC in your motives.
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin @FDRLST Mike!  I love you, but here's MY plan! Sessions to lead Senate, Gohmert/House, or it will NOT change!
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin All bills must be made public for the people to read before signed.  ALL BILLS MUST BE READ before signed.
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin 1. Balance within ten years (without accounting gimmicks),
2. Not raise taxes, 
3. Repeal Obamacare.#JustDoIt
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin A well thought out, reasoned plan. Now... legalize all incandescent light bulbs!
TERM LIMITS!!! “@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke: http://ow.ly/DVBbW ”
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin can't we somehow expose the real Obama's as the bigots and disassociate pair they are. They don't care.
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin There are items that most support & only well meaning liberal nitwits won't support. After all they have theirs
@SenMikeLee An excellent piece...one I virtually totally support.
@SenMikeLee @michellemalkin Hey Senator, you can't be serious if YOU don't announce that @SenatorReid 's nuclear option has to stay alive.
@SenMikeLee This is excellent. Impressive as philosophy, strategy, and tactics. My admiration for you has leapt to another level.
@SenMikeLee @marymauldin @FDRLST #AmericaSpoke just do it OUR way, no faux reaching across the aisle
“@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke: http://ow.ly/DVBbW ” why I trust Mike Lee.
@SenMikeLee Sounds pretty good.
@SenMikeLee I thank God that you're my senator. You are thoughtful and principled and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to shake your hand.
@SenMikeLee @ElishaNEWS Something keeps tugging at me about ACA. How did it get thru Congress? Had to be back room deals.
@SenMikeLee @ElishaNEWS @FDRLST good ideas. I have a feeling that most Democrats & Rhinos will not like your ideas...
Urge you @SenMikeLee & all @GOP to show America what #transparency looks like~ALL bills made public AND Obama response
vetoes must be seen!!
@SenMikeLee @marymauldin Stop Obama!  Shut him down!
“@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke: http://ow.ly/DVBbW ”

Great plan, Sen. Lee.
We need term limits 4 Congress & SCOTUS @SenMikeLee @FDRLST
Congress can't fix itself. We need an Article V Convention of the States 2 pass @marklevinshow Liberty Amendments #tcot @SenMikeLee @FDRLST
@SenMikeLee @BassAckwardsUSA #FairTax get rid to #IRS Do you think Dems have learned lesson about voting with Obama? #Democrats12
@SenMikeLee @BassAckwardsUSA So we need 12 Democrats to get a 2/3s vote & Yes break the bills apart!! NO OMNIBUS!!
@SenMikeLee @PatHensley14 don't fall for the "go along to get along" clap trap of the left, we voted to stop any more of the bad spending
@SandraHartle @SenMikeLee I agree. R(inos) are Dems in disguise.
@PatHensley14 @SenMikeLee Some have been there too long and don't even know they have been pulled way past center, into left field
@SandraHartle @SenMikeLee It's an addiction problem I think.
@PatHensley14 @SenMikeLee Clean bills so we know what we are paying for, no more bloated budgets with grants going to God knows who.
@SenMikeLee @pikester45 #AmericaSpoke Okiee Dokiee here ya go my two cents> http://sharlaslabyrinth.blogspot.com/2014/11/gop-tsunami-republicans-take-senate-win.html …  http://sharlaslabyrinth.blogspot.com/2014/11/attn-gop-john-boehner-mitch-mcconnell.html …
@SenMikeLee 1st step. Start imprisonment and impeachment of the foreign usurper occupying white house &terrorizing our country.
@SenMikeLee Think Cruz and Think Gowdy as the first major steps to recovery.
Mike, do not compromise any of your principles!!! “@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know... MT http://ow.ly/DVBbW ”
@SenMikeLee Address ACA using rules approach suggested by @mfcannon so budget can be purer play? #AmericasPoke
Thank you @SenMikeLee @mdk06792015 ...add to that a badly needed CHANGE in Senate leadership ...my choices would be Sessions, Cruz or you
@SenMikeLee  3 step plan Mike.  1) We elected mature people.  2) Act like we chose correctly.  3) Talk nice to the kids. #AmericaSpoke
@SenMikeLee @FDRLST Awesome ideas I hope can be carried through. If only the rest of the Repubs felt as you do. Don't settle for status quo.
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU!  This is one of BEST things I've read & you are SPOT ON!  We will be there in 2016 from TX to help your reelection!!!
@SenMikeLee U & other few conservatives need to FIGHT the RINOs by getting WE THE PEOPLE on your side of PRINCIPLES!  DO NOT COWER!
@SenMikeLee OUTSTANDING....THANK YOU!
@SenMikeLee If Republicans do nothing on immigration, we will lose in 2016. We MUST put a bill on Obama's desk that fixes the problem
@CoxWebDev @SenMikeLee I vote for enforcing current law and fixing fraud and abuse in the current H1B system.
@USAB4L @SenMikeLee Current law is not enforcable. It's too complex and outdated. We need to fix it.
@SenMikeLee @FDRLST agree but don't loose site ; mandate = stop the lawless radical in the White House
@SenMikeLee you will be hearing from me. Next Townhalls? Keystone ,boarders and Military and stop Obama before he hurts us event more.
@SenMikeLee Dont back down 2 Liberal Repubs--> DeFund Obamacare. NO Amnesty.Take it 2/t ppl, use social media 2 debunk lies.  #americaspoke
@SenMikeLee stop the "comprehensive" BS. Pass some bills that fix things in small increments. Make Obama veto good conservative principals
Resigning would be a start.
#PayYourMortgage

“@SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke ”
@SenMikeLee goal 1 is to unite established gop w/ new grass roots conservatives.  New senate leadership 2nd. Then go2 work! @SenRonJohnson
@SenMikeLee Senator Lee...IMHO a lot of middle class economic anxiety is related to the RIDICULOUS cost of higher education.
@SenMikeLee  don't compromise until after the harm done by dems are fixed! To be fair you must get back to status quo BEFORE unfair dem acts
@SenMikeLee @FDRLST Don't repair the procedural damage done by dems until undo the unfair policies and action done under those unfair rules
Excellent. RT @SenMikeLee: Here's my plan to fix Congress. Let me know what you think using #AmericaSpoke: http://ow.ly/DVBbW  #utpol
.@SenMikeLee odd years-ballot measure to approve Congress. If fail, all seats up for election next year, no incumbent eligible #AmericaSpoke
