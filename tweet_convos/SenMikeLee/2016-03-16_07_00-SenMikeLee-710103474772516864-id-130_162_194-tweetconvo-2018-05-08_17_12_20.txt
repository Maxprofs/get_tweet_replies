@SenMikeLee do your job. The people spoke 4 years ago and we support POTUS and the constitution. Your bias is clear. #GOP #FORTHEPEOPLE
@SenMikeLee Do your job. Do your job. Do your job. THIS IS YOUR JOB. Do your job.
@SenMikeLee C'mon, really? We did choose the justice when we chose Obama in 2012. Let the people's choice be heard!
@SenMikeLee It is such a shame that such petty partisanship is allowed to get in the way of what is best for this country! #SCOTUSnominee
@SenMikeLee Why? He is the @POTUS elected by the PEOPLE. #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee why does this guy even have a voice?  Doesn't he have to clear every thought through Cruz?
@SenMikeLee Yeah, we don't want to take you away from all of the time you spend not doing your jobs. We need term limits for the senate asap
.@SenMikeLee @sltrib what if he nominated a tea party person like yourself? Or is because “not from Obama”? You don’t represent me.
@SenMikeLee Um who provides the money for your paycheck? OH RIGHT. The citizens. Maybe listen to them? #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee is it hard being a walking sack of crap living partially inside Ted Cruz's anus?
@SenMikeLee Waste of your time? Can you name one thing the senate has accomplished that doesn't include obstruction?
@SenMikeLee Seems like anything of substance is a waste of your time.
@SenMikeLee YOU are a waste of time. DO YOUR JOB. If you are so anti-Federal government, why on earth did you run to become a part of it
@SenMikeLee Doesn't the #GOP have a name for someone who doesn't work yet expects a pay check? Yup, you make a dandy little welfare queen.
@SenMikeLee  You know what is a waste of time? Is paying you to do a job that you are refusing to do. Hopefully you don't win reelection.
@SenMikeLee he is POTUS until Jan. 20, you have a responsibility to give a fair hearing to whoever he nominates, till then, you hypocrite.
@SenMikeLee  So what else is new? All the senate ever does is waste its time. Do something for a change, something good. #DOYOURJOB
@SenMikeLee Or you not commit the treasonous act of refusing to do your job & act like an adult...that may suit you, never know..
@SenMikeLee It is your constitutional duty Senator.
@SenMikeLee @BenWinslow good to know you think doing your job is a waste of time.
@SenMikeLee I miss Bob Bennett
@SenMikeLee A moderate now - a young liberal later. Wonder how you'll feel when Hillary picks.
@SenMikeLee thank you for following the Biden rule.  It may fall to Hillary, maybe to someone else, but that's what both sides have done.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib you waste the senates time constantly. Why are you still there?
@SenMikeLee It is YOU who is CREATING the "waste of time." DO YOUR JOB!!!
@SenMikeLee @sltrib wow that’s constructive.
@SenMikeLee Wasting time!  That's what the stupid senate does every day!
@SenMikeLee  you mean because you won't #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee get off Twitter and do your job!!!
@SenMikeLee My 4yo son didn't want to go to preschool today. He still went though because currently, IT'S HIS JOB. Stop acting like a 4yo.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @LibertyBell1000 Time to start running the video of barry blocking Bush's nominee....
@SenMikeLee what a joke!  How can you restore constitutional leadership if you won't even try to do your job!?
@SenMikeLee Then resign.
@SenMikeLee DO NOT WEAKEN AT THE KNEES!!! WE ARE STANDING BEHIND YOU!!!
@SenMikeLee @LibertyBell1000 2of2/ State S/Cs can hear cases simultaneously, decide by majority vote. The NATION shld decide national issues
@SenMikeLee @LibertyBell1000 1of2/  Why do we continue to ALLOW as few as FIVE political appointees to overrule our decisions?  END SCOTUS.
@SenMikeLee cuz the senate never wastes time.
@senmikelee @sltrib Doing the job you were elected and swore an oath to perform is never a waste of time. #DoYourJob #utpol
@SenMikeLee you give another reason why I don't support your extreme views or your candidacy to represent Utah. #obstructist won't listen
@SenMikeLee #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee I look forward to the day you can no longer claim to represent me.
@SenMikeLee do your job. You get paid a ridiculous amount of money to be incredibly incompetent.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib Up or down vote #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Isn't it your job to hold hearings? #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee @sltrib if only you would put as much effort into helping the American people as you do into trying to win elections...
.@SenMikeLee I wish I could just not do my job because I'm bought / an ideologue
@SenMikeLee @sltrib Senator, #DoYourJob and stop wasting my time with your inane posturing
@SenMikeLee You and your colleagues are clearly experts at wasting time.
@SenMikeLee: a waste of the senate's time - and the constitution was wasted on you. The American people spoke when @POTUS was elected twice.
@SenMikeLee MFW <10% approval rating.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee The current Senate is adept at wasting time. #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee Please stop
@SenMikeLee Yeah, totally unlike all the Benghazi and Planned Parenthood investigations. Do your fucking job, traitors.
@SenMikeLee spoken like true man who would rather keep a country down by doing nothing than to be moral & dignified by doing what is right
@SenMikeLee Thanks for your continued obstruction of the United States government.
@SenMikeLee congrats on not doing your job.
@SenMikeLee Do your job
@SenMikeLee @sltrib @SenOrrinHatch DO YOUR JOB and follow the flipping constitution.
@senmikelee I despise partisanship. Can’t we be better than that? Please?
@SenMikeLee
Watch @POTUS announce his Supreme Court nominee at 11am ET → http://go.wh.gov/SCOTUS  #SCOTUS 
@SenMikeLee @sltrib DO YOUR JOB!!
@SenMikeLee @BenWinslow  just vote no if the nominee is bad
@SenMikeLee @BenWinslow up..a pitiful media show....
@SenMikeLee thank you. Hopefully the rest of the Senate agrees.
@SenMikeLee HRC will nominate someone more liberal when she's elected. And then this will be on your shoulders.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib THANK YOU! Hillary will bring someone waaaay more progressive. #doyourjob
@SenMikeLee @sltrib As if the Senator's time is so valuable.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib of course it would. When has the Senate ever done their job? This is why your ratings suck & people are voting for trump
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator Lee. Please do not vote for another bad decision from POTUS.
@SenMikeLee Don't confirm. Obama CANNOT be TRUSTED he wants a vote on his illegal immigration pen and phone NO WAY AT ALL!!
@SenMikeLee  Absolutely!! Stick to it!!!!
@SenMikeLee @sltrib So much for your love of the Constitution! #DoYourJob #UniteBlue
@tcp25 @SenMikeLee @sltrib He is.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib Didn't the people already choose when they re-elected Obama?
.@SenMikeLee Holding confirmation hearings is not a waste of time!! DO YOUR DAMN JOB!!
@SenMikeLee thank you senator.
@SenMikeLee I could argue that you are a waste of my time (and I'm from Utah). #truthhurtssometimes
@SenMikeLee this behavior and attitude is a big part of what's wrong with our country and what has given your party to Trump.#obstructionist
@SenMikeLee @sltrib Right. And we wouldn't want any senators "wasting" their time on anything the Constitution requires.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib NO CONVINCE VOTE FOR MCCONNELL NOW! WE INSIST!!! Last Century is not good enough. SCOTT or GOWDY or RUBIO stop Obama! !!
@SenMikeLee Do your job Senator!#DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee the waste of time was the time people wasted voting for your sorry ass!
Do your job senator,this is how Repubs end up w/ Trump
@SenMikeLee Tell that to the other Utah Senator.
@SenMikeLee @sltrib You know your party is about to be taken over by an insane clown racist and xenophobic billionaire right?
@UtahPigBus @SenMikeLee @sltrib Better yet,it's going to hand the WH&Senate to the dems. Guessing Hillary's nominee won't be this moderate
@ColoUte @SenMikeLee @sltrib Hillary's would be a flaming Liberal...flaming.
@SenMikeLee 
#DoYourJob
#QuitStealingPaychecks 
AmIRight, @POTUS ?
@SenMikeLee  You are just another Senator who thinks he is above doing his job just like waste of time @mrubio.
@SenMikeLee Thank U Mike.With so many traitors allegedly representing us U R 1-man who's roots R planted firmly in US soil that speaks 4 us.
@SenMikeLee #DoYourJob
@SenMikeLee it takes a lot of humility and confidence to admit when you're wrong
@SenMikeLee YOU ARE COMMITTING TREASON when you put party befor country and WE THE PEOPLE will not let you get away with it anymore
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU!! Senator the people are behind you!
@SenMikeLee Well, the Senate wastes most of its time anyway.
@SenMikeLee You consider doing your job a waste of time (and money). You are obligated to review, and vote. Its a Senator's job.
@SenMikeLee my name is clemente turner:you are a racist and your party has wasted 7yrs of our countrys BLOOD TIME TREASURE, HANGINS 2GOOD 4U
@SenMikeLee Excellent! Let's see if the establishment has the balls to keep up the block.
@SenMikeLee @hfearny I guess you can always wait for Hillary to nominate someone.
@kjewellcook Both will be bad. *shrugs*
@SenMikeLee ... That is UNCONSTITUTIONAL
@SenMikeLee I'm really confused about this.  Why wouldn't you just wait to see who is nominated and THEN make up your mind?
@SenMikeLee so you've just completely given up on governing properly?
