@SenMikeLee what the Hell are you and congress going to do about this rogue president. Sick of it. It's time Americans take back our country
@jinx510 @andilinks @SenMikeLee seems to me  EO has amended law INA Sec212 [8 U.S.C. 1182] see (4)(A) & (9)(B)(i)(II) http://www.uscis.gov/iframe/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html …
EO's are subject to judicial review, I can't see this one standing for long. @fiverrules @jinx510 @SenMikeLee
@andilinks @jinx510 @SenMikeLee Not soon enough. Intentional division & "fire starting" beginning to tear republic apart.
…things will begin happening more quickly than we can cope with them, then they w/declare an emergency. @fiverrules @jinx510 @SenMikeLee
@andilinks @fiverrules @jinx510 @SenMikeLee another day, another EO.
Yes, you can distract from the chaos with more chaos. @CjfRiley @fiverrules @jinx510 @SenMikeLee
@andilinks @fiverrules @jinx510 @SenMikeLee deception is the currency of the devil
.@SenMikeLee ~ Obama thinks of himself as the "Czar" .. and thinks of Congress as the "Duma" ~ @SeeTac7
It's not so much the party anymore Kelly, it's about O's legacy. He wants to get something done @KellyRek @SenMikeLee @SeeTac7
.@dparkinson45 ~ "The ends justify the means." ~ @SenMikeLee @SeeTac7
I know this is late coming...but it doesn't exist.  A definition (for real) of a large bunch of baboons is a CONGRESS.
@SenMikeLee Saw what you did there, you used quotes to claim POTUS said that, but you lied. He didn't say that, you thought that. #ToxicGOP
@SenMikeLee @WortheyAC  It's really time for Congress to be patriots. Stop this guy!! He still has 2 years to finish our destruction!
@SenMikeLee Don't be afraid of Any option. We are counting on you to save America from this Tyranny! We want representative government!
@SenMikeLee @crackenbob When Congress is removed from process, the people lose their voice in gov. What do we have left? Nothing !
@SenMikeLee Sen. How bout you guys do SIMPLE Plan like this for the good of 100% of US, FINALLY. MERRY CHRISTMAS USA
@SenMikeLee The quotation mark would mean you are quoting POTUS. You probably weren't teach that in the underfunded Utah public schools.
@SenMikeLee quit the anti-Obama stuff...work on U.S. Infrastructure, jobs, student loans. Do Something!
@SenMikeLee @crackenbob Everything Obama outlined he is basically already doing. He has castrated border agents, stopped legal action.
@SenMikeLee @KarrattiPaul The Mandate from Nov 4 clearly requires Congress to Block and Reverse Obama's agendas. Do it!!!
@navstadt @KarrattiPaul @SenMikeLee Really? Some must not have gotten the memo. McConnel was rolling over for amnesty within 2 seconds.
@SenMikeLee That's weak. If Congress would actually do something, President Obama wouldn't have to. At this point you're stealing paychecks.
@MenaceSocietyUT -Do Something? U mean do as BO says? If BHO enforced the exiting immigration laws we wouldn't have a problem @SenMikeLee
@SCforfreedom @SenMikeLee 
Yeah, because the immigration problem started when Obama took office. It hasn't existed for decades.
@SenMikeLee POTUS IS WRONG!! Congress does exist but doesn't do ANYTHING! Never mind ! POTUS WAS CORRECT!! My bad!!!
@SenMikeLee #SenMikeLeeTellsLiesAboutThePreisdent
@SenMikeLee Senator, is this indeed a direct quote from the President? Or is this a deliberate lie.
@SenMikeLee  Thank you for standing up for America. XO.
%obongo chronicles % #IRAN gets A NUC WEAPON, no use 4 1yr. TILL THEIR ICBM ready, AIMING @ US via @jiminhofe = “Dhimmitude”  @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee  Why doesn't anyone even dare to poll the American people about whether they want to see b.o. impeached? I think the majority do
@SenMikeLee Thanks for the update . Now PASS A BILL!!
@SenMikeLee When you have the lowest production in congressional history you basically don't exist. Do your damn job!!
@SenMikeLee can we pretend he doesn't exist? Send him over to Africa, Iran, Russia,Gitmo? Just go golfing on his own dang dime, JUST GO!
@SenMikeLee @LATiffani1 no pay check for dem in Congress if they believe obama can pass & write law there is NO use for them
@SenMikeLee now that obama made Congress Irrelevant u should pass a Law that dems cant receive a paycheck they believe he can write&pass law
@SenMikeLee  Country needs you now more than ever to defend the constitution. We did our job Nov 4. Stand strong. We have your back.
“@SenMikeLee: POTUS:  "I know the politics of this issue are tough; that's why I'm going to pretend Congress doesn't exist."”#DefundObama
@SenMikeLee You only hear what you want to hear #typicalpolitician #willfulignorance #getoveryourself
@SenMikeLee doubt Pres Obama cares what you think and neither do I
@SenMikeLee Republicans:"We don't like nor respect immigrants so we are going to oppose him and people he represent" #getoveryourself
@SenMikeLee Liar
@SenMikeLee @philnovack we must impeach this dictator.
@SenMikeLee And Congress erplies: Yeah, okay. Whatever you say, your highness.
@SenMikeLee @New0rleans_Lady --gave House Power in 2010-they did nothing 2 stop BHO- last nite declared himself Dictator-@SpeakerBoehner WHY
@New0rleans_Lady @SenMikeLee @SpeakerBoehner --They were given most Power b/c they CONTROL the purse-ppl like Ryan worked with Dems-spending
@New0rleans_Lady @SenMikeLee @SpeakerBoehner @RepHalRogers said-"We can't legally stop BHO's amnesty" He gets $ fr printing ID 4 BO illegals
@SenMikeLee It's Time you get some Conservative Senators & Leave the GOP you have us to go with you. #tcot #ccot
@SenMikeLee We lovu Jim and We love Obama to
@GastonSlsg @SenMikeLee The people spoke on the 6th, Mike. Game on. Cowards won't last.
@SenMikeLee every Repub president since Eisenhower have done the same this. So how is President Obama "shredding the Constitution"?
@SenMikeLee @AlyssaLafage Thank you Senator for properly characterizing this! Now we _need_ you to ensure that Congress does _its_ job!
@SenMikeLee @RestoreHistory Congress makes themselves irrelevant by allowing this sob to get away with running over  them.When do they fight
@SenMikeLee @RestoreHistory Well, does Congress exist? If it does, does it plan 2 plan or plan 2 talk? Baby steps 1st to defund each day
@SenMikeLee Boehner: I know the politics of this are tough; that's why I'm going to pretend the senate doesn't exist
@SenMikeLee @northmtnstates only your side Senator.
@SenMikeLee @Pissed_Pat Much easier that way.
@SenMikeLee @SeeTac7 Good. Can't wait for Joni Ernst to make Obama squeal.
@SenMikeLee @texbarb I voted for @BarackObama , but I see this as no-bid contracts & corporate offshoring - skirting law. Take him to task.
@SenMikeLee Easy to do when Congress does nothing to ease the Obama nightmare.
@SenMikeLee He had both houses his first two years, what happened? Couldn't they work on more than one item?
@SenMikeLee But Congress does exist. They just don't do anything. They get nothing done. They take long lavish holidays.
@SenMikeLee Obama thinks We The People don't exist either! Please stand up for us with all the power you & congress has against lawlessness!
@SenMikeLee #asshat
@SenMikeLee I heard his speech and you have misquoted the POTUS.
@SenMikeLee @northmtnstates Distortion of facts from a ignoring distort facts party of lying intended on doing nothing. #ImmigrationAction!
@SenMikeLee ..so. Tell the house to pass a bill.
@SenMikeLee @billpostmus they're a 'pigment' In their own mind. #gopcongress
@SenMikeLee as soon as you lift a finger to legislate and bring forth solutions, all your talk is complete bullshit.
@SenMikeLee @votermom  Obam is correct, With Mcconnel and Boehner in leadership Congress no longer exisits, neither does constitution
@SenMikeLee @billpostmus Arrogant bastard!  XS
@SenMikeLee @LnGunMan CRIMINAL.
@SenMikeLee If you like your constitution you can keep your constitution
@MiaVeritas @SenMikeLee #Ogruber gives up on America!
@SenMikeLee @KyLawnDude  Get your damn ass off twitter & do your damn job,  IMPEACH & ARREST this POS
@SenMikeLee ONLY OPTION !
@SenMikeLee What are you going to do about it?
@SenMikeLee It would be helpful for RNC to saturate with vids of legal imm doing it right. But maybe pubbies on take too! Anger out here 10+
@SenMikeLee where's GOP replacement for ACA?  Or immigration? Or anything?  You have 2 yrs to show us something...ain't holding my breath.
@SenMikeLee so do something and #ImpeachObama
@SenMikeLee @LFS7
@SenMikeLee sorry to tell you this, but Congress has acted exactly as if they don't exist in any capacity, except obstruction.
@SenMikeLee 
Who is going to step up and arrest BHO lawlessness???
@SenMikeLee Except when he needs them to cover his rear end in war, to get their approval, yes?
@SenMikeLee In other words...the people of the Unites States do not exist as their representatives don't exist and only Obama exist...bullsh
@SenMikeLee "My name is Obamandias, king of kings!  Look upon my works ye patriots and despair ..."  -- Apologies to Shelley
@SenMikeLee Exactly you ignorant fool
@SenMikeLee  Absurd.  He has NO legal precedence for this executive  order.
@SenMikeLee Maybe you and the rest of congress can do your job?
@SenMikeLee good one, mike.
@SenMikeLee well when there are senators like you..
@SenMikeLee Do you know about this?
@SenMikeLee compares them to his daughters! Ha!
@SenMikeLee Please Sir. You have to save this country from Obama's disregard of the Constitution. I'm begging you.
RT @SenMikeLee: POTUS:  "I know the politics of this issue are tough; that's why I'm going to pretend Congress doesn't exist."
@SenMikeLee he has to be stopped!
@SenMikeLee That's exactly what he said.
@SenMikeLee congress won't do anything,  so...umm...yeah
@SenMikeLee ..so GOP Congress WTH are you going to do to stop the emperor who just violated the Constitution of the United States!!!
@SenMikeLee @1969tttt Exactly.
@SenMikeLee CONGRESS DOESNT EXIST YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING WORTHLESS
@SenMikeLee if this is how you feel, then #Republicans should get some balls in February and set him straight or show him the door. #lawless
.@SenMikeLee Please, as an American, I'm begging you...DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS! #Defund Use the #PowerOfThePurse Save our great nation!
@SenMikeLee then do something about it....that's what America is waiting for
@SenMikeLee It was a great speech, but why not persuade congress to pass the bill using this speech? Agree with substance, not process.
@SenMikeLee Americans see what's going on here. Obama is a dictator.  We want our Constitution defended. We don't do kings.
@LHolloway2 @SenMikeLee the house could vote on the bill the senate passed...
@SenMikeLee "If Congress doesn't give me what I want, I'll throw a tantrum until they fall in line." (Community Organizing 101)
@SenMikeLee I like you more and more w/every tweet!
@SenMikeLee it is up to you and other's in the Senate to halt this assault on the separation of powers.
@bdp514am @SenMikeLee Why is "other's" single-possessive?  #URADUMBASS2015
@SenMikeLee Don't fear a shutdown!
