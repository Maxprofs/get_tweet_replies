Absolutely. Please keep fighting for #FullRepeal and free market solutions.
ACA is a free market solution
You can have any color you want, as long as it's black, and costs enough to cover Minimum Essential Coverage.
You seriously have no idea how the ACA works, do you?
they never due they just think it's "blackcare"
Where is your DETAILED PLAN?  I guess you need more than 6 years. That's called worthless by my judgment.
it's dangerous to just repeal without a replacement ready to go.
No it's not! We didnt have govt insurance for over 200 years and planets didnt collide. Free market!
think of those that now have it, but would lose it with nothing in place.  What would you do?
turn that place into hong Kong
or singapore!
Thank you, Mike, for standing tall in support of OUR values --- for not taking @SpeakerRyan's bait! We need a CLEAN REPEAL & FREE MARKET!
Ryan Plan=Failure! @POTUS support Freedom Caucus Plan. They have put 4th best/fairest/smartest healthcare plan 4 R country. #DTS
Who's this "we" you speak of?  The AMERICAN PEOPLE do not want this repealed #saveourhealthcare
.@UTwomenallies @SenMikeLee The majority American People #RepealNotReplace *I* do not work hard to support your HC. MY TAXES=BO-RyanCare
you pay for his HC and he pays for yours. What's the issue?
the millions dumped into Medicare pay nothing #justSaying
@TruckerBobS Mike Lee you need to get on board
If repeal it, & 6 months later, replace. Whats your plan for a gap plan.I had my own ins b4 ACA/Obama made me buy in.
@SpeakerRyan found the one thing that the right and the left can agree on
 @RAndrewMartens No, not everyone on right & left wants #repeal & agrees on this new statement from @SenMikeLee. Tweek/fix, don't repeal.
show me a conservative that likes either bill/law and I will show you a fake conservative.
Bull - let's get Something done for once and tweak it later
@SoSezMikey Obama DID get something done. After years/decades of talk got a fix: #Obamacare. Tweeks are all we need,NOT restart.@SenMikeLee
@TruckerBobS 
Jedi Mind Trick: "This isn't the #ObamaCare replacement bill you've been waiting for...Move Along..."
.@SenMikeLee @Twin66 You've had eight  years to propose a solution and this is your response? You got elected to solve this. #CBO #Fail
the only suitable replacement is a plan to phase out government from healthcare entirely.
Why not send Trump the 2015 full repeal bill? This tells me GOP leadership never wanted full repeal. They lied to us. Again.
Mr. "Pro" - That's a helluva sick comment. You are pathetic. Go away.
Fight like hell. Kill this bill.
Can't they just throw the whole thing on the ashheap and let the free market provide? Another entitlement is a bad idea.
They could pass a bill to allow state lines/free market today if they wanted to. On it's own & separate from Ocare.
.@SenMikeLee Absolutely.Unearned Tax Credits R More Redistribution And Market Distortion.Empower The Individual @RepMikeBishop @repdavetrott
no one is mentioning the mandatory clause, and the fines that may be imposed.
keep fighting the good fight.  Full repeal is worth standing your ground.
Exactly! For premiums that spiked 300% who cares if, eventually, they drop 15%. What is the point?
Try repeal and not replace. I want freedom to buy or not buy whatever the heck I want or do not want.
@votewarren We need universal healthcare for all Americans.  US is the only industrialized nation without universal healthcare.
And what do you do in the interim?  Where is your plan?  You guys have had 6 years!  I'm on your site searching.....nada, nyet,.
why @SenMikeLee does it not eff over enough poor ppl + give insurance execs big enough tax cuts? the free market is hazardous to our health!
True poor ppl have medicaid! Those who barely live above poverty are being slaughtered w/ obamacare.
No @aaaaaaaaaaaronn wasn't agreeing, said free market is hurting us. #Obamacare has HELPED my sis & I not hurt.@SenMikeLee
yep. Private healthcare companies put profits over ppl: keep them out & we can use that $ for care!
If I had my Ocare payments BACK, I could afford my surgery MYSELF! Too expensive to USE Ocare.
sounds like your state did not opt in to the Medicaid expansion. Many Republican govs did that
which kept millions of federal funds from their citizens which would've helped keep costs down
Wrong. You dont know as much as you think you know. We want ZERO FED govt healthcare.
Pass legislation allowing hospitals to deny care to the uninsured and you'll see almost everyone buying insurance!
Well, where is your DETAILED plan? Oh yeah, that's right,  you want to talk more.
@jinouyang @GOP #BeBoldNotBoehner 2018 is really your last chance.  Fail at your own peril.  Go #MAGA or go home
embarrassing!
God bless you, Sen. Lee. Thank you for standing, and against relentless pressure and fury. Do what's right.
@LarryNaselli  Can't the Republicans get it together. What ideas  have you come up with Senator Lee?
you may have to step up and help
@sistertoldjah "these aren't the droids you're looking for" 
Sorry couldn't  resist it.
@tographer then go help get it done ..
@blackrepublican Get rid of the "Bird" rule just for this!?
of course not. It doesn't take health care away completely.
you are wrong.  just wait --it's complicated, but you have to start at the beginning and walk with it. get behind this, all!
#Wrong_Direction is correct. Stop this now. @POTUS.
@RandPaul @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Support Sen. Paul's repeal bill. Trash @SpeakerRyan Obama-Ryan care bill
So why don't you make a real proposal instead of talking points?  I appreciate that some are brave enough to at least try.
@hoosiergirl71 It's Ryan...check him!
Then Sen Lee...where is your plan?  Your alternative. You've had 6 years yet all you guys have is the repeal. Sad.
That's right! Repeal. NO replace!
Its a $600 billion sneaky tax cut for the 1%, thy tht thy cud fool us! Rip us off wth a 100 pg Fake HCP! WE KNOW AND WILL STP TM
Mike Lee for President 2020
Am fully supportive of the conservatives. Let'em know.
: agree with you on almost nothing, but unified in this. Pass along to @jasoninthehouse he doesn't listen to his constituents.
SO right! We R going to miss chance to get Gov off our backs & to lower costs by competition so that all may have ACCESS to AHC.
Glad to see U with @RandPaul & @freedomcaucus on wanting to destroy this Obamacare 2.0 garbage! How about pushing Rand's SB 222?
20 MILLION  Americans losing their insurance isn't enough? wasn't "you're going to lose your care" a talking point for you?
does your faith call you to help the poor? are you a liar?
how much is your salary, and how much of it would you donate to help low income people with their health care costs?
I was diagnosed a Type 1 diabetic at age 2. is the market going to provide for me?
by which you mean it doesn't hurt the poor enough?
@WashingtonDCTea good speak up and let's have open debate and include blue collar solutions to or face big trouble at midterm
@WashingtonDCTea it better get fixed - what incompetence!!
Don't let Trump bully this through! He does not have to represent #Republicans  
Take the @GOP back!
#AHCA #TrumpRussia
It's clear to me that you don't care if I have healthcare AT ALL. It's clear to me, that you don't care if I die. Holladay 84117
Here's documentation of Obamacare not having been passed, if not given before, http://changingwind.org/rename/comment.php?comment.news.121 … #RyanStrikeObamacare
Until Obamacare passes Art I, Sec 7 Constitutional muster by 60 vote approval it isn't a law, not subject to repeal #Teaparty
Re-submit the bill to be passed again as a tax with all House Ways & Means review. Anything else is unconstitutional! #Teaparty
Upon SCOTUS finding Obamacare a tax, it lost its legislative authority entirely and requires striking it from the record or....
Procedures of the Congress for taxes under Article I, Sec 7 per House Rules weren't followed, http://changingwind.org/rename/comment.php?comment.news.121 … #Obamacare
I have asked @SpeakerRyan where is the public markup, where can I submit my version of the bill, but it's not a law so no need.
The political football and subject-matter hyping of "issues" that sell and promote political parties must end. #DrainTheSwamp
Pursuant to Constitution's checks and balances, #StrikeObamacare from record of Congress or submit to be passed as tax #Teaparty
Also, once SCOTUS said Obamacare is a tax, the process of passing it was insufficient, it's not a law thereby.
"Democracy," also, in no way means, these supposed 30m should be dictating policy for the other 300m Americans! #StrikeObamacare
This bill needs to just be a bridge act to assure those supposed 30m with O'care are not obandoned #Teaparty
This bill applies this to States and thereby includes the populations of those States. The States and People do not want this.
I'll go further, throughout the #Obamacare repeal bill is "automatically enrolled" language, do A and DC says you're a member
Do you differentiate between Medicaid for the general population, and Medicaid for the disabled/?   Two different populations.
Let's do what the democrats did. We have to repeal it first, so we can find out what we eliminated.
This draft needs Lottery winner Pgs9-15 & Mandate at p62L4 to p65L5 struck, http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3492553/Merged-Document.pdf … #Teaparty #MAGA
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #FullRepeal ! @marklevinshow @RMConservative
@pambesteder And what do Americans do in the meantime for insurance? Individuals r using Obama Care. Its their only choice
@vmpcott Agree.  Get it right or not at all.
You had 7 YEARS to figure out something. 7 YEARS of OBAMA to come up with a better solution. Come on....
So get to work!
I agree Senator. It's Inomacare light. When will these republicans understand we need NOMORE ENTITLEMENTS
Ask trump about Kislyak and Mammadov.  Or don't you care about any of that corrupt stuff?  Tax returns matter.
if congress doesn't support repeal and replace look to loose moderate support resulting in another Obama.
Get on board Americans are suffering from the lousy disgusting Obamacare bill GET ON BOARD! We the people demand it!
I trust President Trump. Work the process.
they're going to be in for a big disappointment come the next election cycle! Tea Party, activate!
Yes!! A terrible bill! Plz keep fighting for a free market solution with min govt. Could you write one??
Now Obamacare becomes even more entrenched, like every other entitlement created in this country, leaving us little for savings.
Sen. Lee, as Utahn, I ask you to fight Trump's Leftist agenda, get Govt out of commercial sphere altogether 
#FreeMarket
I AM SO SICK AND TIRED OF BUSINESS AS USUAL @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No on #Obamacarelite
Since we are Land of the Free; why not let Health care market go back to free market system. Allow charity Church Hospitals to take up slack
"How about Obamacare replacement Govt. eliminates student loan debt for Dr. interns that do house calls for needy, based on..."
"For every hour an Intern works delivering health care via house calls; X amount of debt is removed from his or her student loan debt."
So help make it better, the alternative is Obamacare.
Agree completely. Thanks for standing up for your principles and for the voters who want #FullRepeal not Obamacare lite.
You had 7yrs to come up with a replacement & the best you have is repeal? Wtf, have you been doing for 7yrs?
@POTUS NEED TO DELIVER WHAT WAS PROMISED. Or lose in four years. RINOS will sabotage ur efforts to repeal/replace. @SpeakerRyan
Then work together to improve it. Repeal w/o replacement is 7yrs to late. Quit bitching & get to work.
Its called GOP est. proving they want big govt. It's clear they LIKE Obama care-Passed repeal 20+ times knowing BO would veto.
It is still a communist government program. As if all the other guv programs aren't killing us already.
glad you don't like current replacement. Disappointed that you want to repeal then replace. Irresponsible! Millions will die.
yes, repeal #Obamacare and open up the markets across states and get the govt out of private healthcare & a bunch of other stuff
hope u will meet trump and discuss these things
Good morning Sir, now yourself and the rest of the Freedom Caucus can change it to what we the ppl want....get to work!
you had 8 years. Your an irresponsible group of leaders with party above country priorities
Amazing that you guys have been complaining about ObamaCare for so long and still have no solutions.
from what I have seen, the bill is trying to replace stick w a carrot. Tax credit for being responsible +++
When you say republicans were elected to repeal, keep in mind while you still control both houses, you lost seats in both.
Saw you on Fox saying most Americans want it repealed. Not true. Pretty much an even split.
Thank you for standing up for us! You along with a few others are our only hope!
@realDonaldTrump Don't let the in DC fool you about the Obamacare2.0.. Please examine it,  only trust you.
@TeaPartyNevada

 In its present form it is one of the top five political blunders of all time.
1994 Gingrich said healthIndustry can do better than HillaryCare. 2012: blankSheetMcConnell. @gop lies 20+ yrs later.
.@SenMikeLee @TeaPartyNevada you of all people know there are 2 more phases coming what is your contribution to the bill? Are you on it?
The @FreedomCaucus was locked of the drafting of #AmericanHealthCareAct. At least get to read it before voting on it like Dems did
I'm thinking they weren't doing such a bang up job with the last administration huh? Not one's been held acct
get the last PPACA repeal bill that obama vetoed and change the date, then ask @potus to sign it
Agree. The sooner we get a single payer, the better.
Compromise, modestly accept compromise. No one is completely right. Don't let Perfect be the Enemy of Good.
@sthomas0311 We The People demand Obama …http://CaretobeabolishedcompletelyGovt.MustgetoutofHealthCareNomandatoryorderedgovt.HealthCare !
@sthomas0311 We The People demand you to vote Yes to defund Planned Parenthood!
what's your plan then?
Refundable Tax Credits = billions of dollars of fraud. Sell catastrophic policies across state lines.
@TheMarkRomano you got in too big a hurry..if it took a year to get all the best minds in health care involved so be it
We didnt put you guys in cntrl of all 3 parts of govt to fight amongst yourselves. Get it figured out! So tired of all the bs!
Then the president needs to veto the bill and have you all try again. This has to be done right! Godspeed Senator.
@janehughesmd Thank you Senator Lee. Bleach bit Obamacare. Start over. No special interests in the room except American people.
Fix it, please. Go convince Trump there is a better way. No more broken GOP promises. Repeal then replace with what was promised
TrumpCare is ObamaCare with a different name. #RinoCare
As my Senator @SenTedCruz I couldn't agree with Sen. Lee more!
@docdhj Couldn't agree more Sen Lee!!!!!!
.. Trumpcare is worse than Obamacare!!!!! Big government run amok.
@docdhj They didn't do anything to obamacare.
then quit tweeting about it and start working to fix it also called compromise
@CardPamcard Remove cogressional insurance when ACA is repealed . Give congress incentive to fix it right
@TheMarkRomano @LindaSuhler @realDonaldTrump @pjbowles  Rand Paul is right this time. #Rinocare #Accountability #FullRepeal
Then take this bill and work with congress and make it right. Then pass it and get it signed!
@EmfingerSScout I agree mike
@EmfingerSScout Did ya look at @RandPaul bill? What ya think? #MAGA
just make sure this waste of paper dies in the Senate!
if you're going to reject - Where's your plan?
Please resist repeal with this bill.  Don't let 45 scare you with tweet threats.
agreed!! We need free market based competitive health insurance.
The ACA is in your hands now. I hope that you handle this with the same care you have for your re-election.
Way to go sir. Thank you for all you're doing on our behalf, and God bless you!
@TheMarkRomano I've always felt the rhinos never did want to repeal.
@sawsharee #FrankinCare.....the dead lives!
So Senator what are you doing to help fix it? It should be a team effort for the American People.
Thank you!
I thought @SpeakerRyan was a financial genius, but this plan was developed by a dunderhead
@TheMarkRomano this repeal bill is junk they need a new bill and really repeal it
it's so frustrating to hear opposition when there's no real EFFORT To COMPROMISE
then offer something damnit
@TheMarkRomano Can not repeal without a replacement PERIOD.
it's the first effing day! Quit bitchin' & start amending the damn bill!@TheMarkRomano
We will LOSE the narrative.  The press is laughing at you. The Dems are mocking you and you guys stand and talk....and talk.
@smokesangel This is pitiful.
Creates an entitlement - Wait a second - Democrats did that! @tedcruz @POTUS
yes becuz it is important that GOP congress kill folks with low mod mid incomes to finance rich while u get taxpayer paid HC.
so I can expect dramatic increases with my employer plan and less benefits?!?!meanwhile u and your cronies get the best.
public statements should be about what you can work with as well as your differences. Build confidence & trust
@TheMarkRomano This is #RyanCare hld over frm Romney/Ryan ticket! Congress nds 2b mandated 2have 2this BS, GET OUT OF MY LIFE!!
@TheMarkRomano Fine but where the hell have the Republicans been for the past 8 years?  You've done NOTHING
@DrewRyun Agreed. Republicans creating more beauracracy and government control. #LobbyistsDream
Fix it then please instead of whining to the press to prove that you can stand up against the president.
Don't give in Please.
yes, it is. Thank you for standing up.
let the Free Market Reign! Get the government OUT of my life!!
#repealobamacare as promised and voted on several times!!! We don't want @GOP version of Obamacare !!!!!  #teaparty #pjnet
The problem is,  the individual market does not have 2 years.
@Collette_AZ YES, we demand #FullRepeal !!
