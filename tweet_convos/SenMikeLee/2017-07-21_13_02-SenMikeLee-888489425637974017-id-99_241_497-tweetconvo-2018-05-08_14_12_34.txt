@jeffsessions IRS confiscated an immigrant family's assets, in Texas, from their bridal shop. Were not charged or found guilty. This.....
Well, @SenMikeLee is fine with that. He is worried about republican white collar criminals. Hence, the bipartisan mention in the story. Sad
Are you on drugs? He doesn't support CAF, legalized gov't theft, or any other crime. He's calling out Sessions for reinstating 2 practices.
Yes, I am on drugs. Blood pressure medication made possible from Obamacare. I was a republican, but they are worried about millionaires only
So now, I need to look after myself, and those I love. I assume you and your family make over $466k a year. Good for you, republicans love $
I have to look after myself.ACA gave my taxes to ppl making $98K to subsidize their ins while I couldn't afford to buy.That's 2× my earnings
Yes, that was one of 199 parts of the plan, added by republicans! Also, if you make less than 12k a year, you are not eligible. REPUBLICANS!
There's no where in the Constitution any citizen has right to my wages or anyone's labor to pay for a good or service. That's theft.

Thank you for standing strong against the ones, who wish to destroy our America. That we both Love...
He damn well promised to repeal
#REPEALOBAMACARE completely as PROMISED! NO trumpcare! #UnitedforFreedom!
Don't take away healthcare from 23 million people
Truth! http://nordic.businessinsider.com/chomsky-says-trumps-scandals-are-only-a-distraction-to-hide-whats-going-on-behind-the-scenes-2017-7/ …
Nothing less than #FullRepeal #RootAndBranch.
It is time to stop this NONSENSE! #KeepThePromise #FullRepeal #UnitedForFreedom We demand our liberty be returned!
Full repeal of obama care!
Please don't vote for BRCA-even Mitch McConnell admitted it was awful! NO INS CO BAILOUTS!! PRIORITY >>>#DefundPP
I read that. Hilarious! No one should bail out rich insurance companies already pocketing billions. Google United Health Care profits.

The Senate is considering #Medicaid cuts that could affect health care for 1 in 5 Americans, 74 million people. http://kaiserf.am/2vUC7ye  
We voted you spineless worms in for repeal NO REPLACE!
this is not constitutional
Politicians need to get OVER themselves and get OUT of health care. #FullRepeal #FreeMarketSolutions #UnitedForFreedom
We can't afford work insurance- ACA pushed up premiums. Not eligible for ACA. Now we pay for own ins + subsidize Ocare! Ridiculous.
Thank you, Senator Lee. You are among the few honest members of the Senate.
He promised to repeal, we will see how honest he is
wasnt this seizure stuff from Sessions?
also Sessions has a history of voter suppression and racism
but you endorsed him. why?
Like our healthcare?? Yes, don't take it. #VoteNoBCRA
Like the ACA   Stop taking our healthcare
MAKE GOOD ON YOUR PROMISE & VOTE NO TO REPEAL THE ACA! WE STAND BEHIND YOU & YOUR CONSCIENCE TO NOT LET 22 MILLION+ GO W/O HEALTH CARE
STOP BLOCKING HEALTHCARE!
Repeal Ocare tomorrow...you promised...do it, please
How many times you plan on voting? Or was that a threat of violence against him?
Agree!! Don't let them take our HEALTHCARE vote NO on repeal please!! Thank you for remembering people over party!!
He was hired to stop YOU from taking away OUR healthcare to give it to yourselves at 3X the price to US.

166 Civil and Human Rights Groups Urge Senate to Reject taking Health Care from Million Americans.
We had no right to seize Russian embassies either.  Where is the proof, beyond Dems cover story for losing election.  Shame on us.
Thank you for speaking out against this. Please also vote no on MTP on senate HC bill. No one knows what's in it, so why vote yes?
That includes ACA. You and the @GOP are the laughingstock of this country. Fools covering for the most corrupt admin in our history
How dare you anchor this corrupt conman to Americans. You think his base is enough to sustain the @GOP?  You're in for a rude awakening
This will be the USA if GOP allows Trump to fire Mueller
WARSAW! 
@Potus ran on repeal and replace. That's what WE voted for. Get over your purity conscience.
What in the world is Sessions thinking??
How will BRCA protect those who cannot purchase insurance bcs they're forced to buy $28k/yr work insurance?
We can't afford work insurance- ACA pushed up premiums. Not eligible for ACA. Now we pay for own ins + subsidize Ocare! Ridiculous.
You must work to get Republicans on board for #FullRepeal. My support for you will be gone if you vote to replace Ocare. #FullRepeal ONLY
Senator Lee, once you vote in BRCA our country goes downhill with socialists. Don't do it. Senators promised #RepealOnly. Remind them.
How much money, etc. is @SpeakerRyan getting from Ins Co's to bail them out & pass #BRCA? We have the right to know! @RandPaul @SpeakerRyan
Probably in the millions. Paul worships his lobbyists. Doesn't give a crap about the people.
You need to become a team player and not a maverick/obstructionist. If not you will own Obamacare!!! Unconscionable and unacceptable
Dear Senator, TY for keeping your promise of #FullRepeal. Most conservatives do not want socialized HC-too much rm 4 Gov abuse/power.
Socialized medicine too easily leads to abuse of Gov power. #FullRepeal, then let ins co's compete over state lines. Costs will go down.
Keep our Military strong, No Sequestration..it is not fair, to our Military
Thank You #MikeLee for what you do! The hit piece on you is crap & we need to #RepealReplace @SenateMajLdr #Progressive hack!
I'd be happy if the Republicans would back our POTUS & help him pass his America First agenda.
"Mike Lee" a State of Utah Republican is the same as a 'Republican' from Illinois! There are no such things!
I love senator Lee.  He is serving in congress honorably
Mike Lee don't sell out! If you vote yes on health bill, we know you sold out. Keep your integrity.
Well said.  If they pass a lukewarm repair, we'll NEVER get rid of Obamacare.  If they can't keep the promise now, they never will
You're such a wind bag - focus on health care. That's where you career ends
Excellent piece Senator.
THANK YOU for fighting for our FREEDOM & defending the CONSTITUTION! Elected officials should be tested on r AMERICANISM
How about you doing what you promised and repealing Obamacare? #Traitor #RINO
Lee is one of the only ones that *is* keeping his promise.
Oh mike, you are so much smarter than this quote. Elevate!
Sir, I am not quite sure of your comment's implication. Mike Lee's intelligence is beyond reproach. Perhaps self elevation is required
senior couple is now destitute. $600K of wedding dresses sold for $6K, for a supposed bill of @$36K. This is theft sanctioned by big govt.
@jeffsessions this is what the Colonists fought against "writs of assistance." WE ARE NOT GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT!!!
One of the reasons why we have a constitution is so people can't act stupidly to give up their rights. That includes rich people.
They can have my house if they take my wife
Sure you stoped repeal but gave the Dems a lifetime of Obama care what a great victory, don't even think about national politics
Don't blame Lee. Blame the 4 Republican dissenters and convince them to do #FullRepeal as promised.
Why are senators dogging on Lee rather than those who broke promise saying they'd do #FullRepeal? Stupid.
So, do it! And hurry up, because what is coming down the pike that they want this right to act worse than criminals? Very scary!
YES, PLEASE!!!!
Mike staying strong voting against Republican health plan and working towards saving Americans. Good job!

Why does the Gov't feel that it's THEIR stuff.   Their stuff is ONLY what we decide they can have not vice versa.
Aside from a few like Sen. Lee they've forgotten WHO they work for They LIE to voters each election then go to work for BIG GOVERNMENT!!

You do know it's your party doing this?
Right now I am mostly concerned with the Senate taking my healthcare. #ProtectOurCare #FixACA #bipartisan #NoOnMTP
Stop the GOP from operating with no moral compass
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Inbox: AARP letter to senators, warning that they’ll tell their 38 million members about every GOP vote on repeal. 
Stencil the 4th on their foreheads Mike!
Get the Obamacare Repeal done Mike...quit distracting from that.
He's trying...it's the 4 Republican dissenters we need to speak with. He's working w/BRCA bcs he sees no other way to repeal ACA.
Hit hard on those R's who flipped on #FullRepeal
Then get on Jeff Sessions' ass about it.
Does this in my healthcare?
When states prohibit forfeiture, Feds sd not be able 2 share assets. Sharing is just a way around state laws. & there is never due process
