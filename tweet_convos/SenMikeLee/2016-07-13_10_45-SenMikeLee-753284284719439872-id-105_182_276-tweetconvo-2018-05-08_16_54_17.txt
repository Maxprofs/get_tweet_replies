We are sick of what we have seen in the past.
spot on. And eliminate depts unconstitutional. As per founders End Dept Ed and others.
We have had enough lawlessness from within. We need a MB purge of all branches, Military & nat. security
@c5hardtop1999 @SpeakerRyan End dept not in constitution return money power to state. Dept ED and some just end.
@c5hardtop1999 @SpeakerRyan All govt retire SS an Medicare. Term limits Amendment 1 bill up / down vote. Live same laws as us
Can we depend on Ryan to not surrender Article I, Power of the purse? The Gov. shut down 20 times since the 1974.
Like repealing the 17th amendment, returning states representation to U.S congress? @BunnysDaughter @SpeakerRyan
Good even though @SpeakerRyan is just trying to weasel out of being primaried. Thug @rep_stevewomack better worry bout that too
Go Mike, GO!
You can only shift blame for so long. Every dog has his day. #WakeUpAmerica @RealDonaldTrump #InfoWars #Truth
what does that mean. Please tell me
Aren't you SOMEWHAT LATE?
It's time to dismantle the corrupt RNC and their tyrant leaders like Mr. Ryan. #ExitGOP
Mike the people have spoken!  Paul you're next
Love it senator. @SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
hopefully you 2 dolts are fired next year
@pnehlen   After handing Obama everything with the majority, now before re election decides to fight? STOP REFUGEES
Even if the legislation passes both chambers , Ratcliffe expects President Obama to veto it.....More of the same.
Trying to eliminate the constitutional system of checks and balances so you can have more power.  Hypocritical.
how's that never Trump movement working for you  Mr Lee no room in this country for pure conservative principles
Whu do you need a another bill to do what the Constitution already says?
From a do nothing congress. Lowest approval in history and they are proud to be on vacation for 7 weeks
lot of talk lack of action
@SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
if congress made laws helping common man instead billionaires & their businesses, those departments wouldn't have 2
Git 'er done!
If you really want the job of writing legislation, then write it instead of obstructing everything. Do your job.
BIG GOV IS AT IT AGAIN!
@america_lost 

WANT good to grow - Stop attacking people verbally - The People can & will beat THIS. POLITICS NO
What the hell is the 4th Branch with a $600 Billion budget, too big, approve 2 Billion
if you fucks dos your job and defended the presidents lawless behavior this article would be moot! DO YOUR JOBS!!!!
SCOTUS in the past few years initiated a move to create a 5th branch when deciding over LGBT issues & marriage act.
CJ. Roberts said these decisions were purely political, not Constitutional. (i.e. J. RG w/ Trump)
What if congress refuses to exercise that power?  You leave POTUS no choice.  Try drafting some clean legislation.
restoration of respect and working for country and people. that is movement forward and yr percentage just went up
shame you support a nominee who Advocates war crimes.hypocrite
I thought the 4th branch was Hillary. U guys failed against the Clinton machine. How could u let this happen?
I think it's time to dismantle the entire US government. You represent the top 1% and the rest of us are f$&@ed.
more nonsense, its time to deport republicans from every elected office
Hey STUPID!  do think Obama will sign it
U fools just keep shooting URselves in the foot w/ such nonsense. #ByeGOPinNov

YES, get rid of the bureaucracies.  Get Fed out of State and Local business.
the power to do nothing?
@ChuckNellis @SpeakerRyan 
That include getting rid of Ryan and McConnell? It should as these two jokers gave Obama everything
Why even have a Republic if the 3 branches are going to overstep their constitutionally set powers?
Worse yet is the tendency to "unify" their political theologies.
So in that case we might as well have an Oligarchy or a Triumvirate.
Lol
#rncconvention You tried Mike! Too many RNC ticks infesting the Party.
@SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
@SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
@SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
@SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan
time to listen to your people as well #Trump2016
Its time to save yourself before getting run over by a train. Please!
you guys don't see America burning. History will show your denial. Of reality and immaturity to grasp problems
nice fence. I wish I had one. You crumbled on that interview
now if we can keep open borders! Get common core! And tpp! Get rid of 2a!
Great. Why didn't you use this awesome plan 3 years ago? It might have made a diff. Big men now aren't you?
Great when will you both resign.   Lee betrayed America by supporting Ted Cruz
why don't you create a congress that does something.  The most ineffective useless branch of government.

I can't take my phone in the room in the @WhiteHouse w/ @POTUS. I'll be back. We have tone honest about the issues & get to solutions.
Where've U all been the past 7 yrs. 6 mths 2 go so it's safe now 2 pretend ur  concerned? "Amen", my ass.
limiting chevron deference is fine better: no "Secretary shall promulgate regs to carry out [unclear] intent [...]"
It's time to dismantle the Republican Party TRUMP IS OUR CHOICE you Republicans will be out of jobs
Is this for real or just another fan dance? Sorry for my skepticism, but.... history.
hasn't the house always had the power to shut down by not funding?
Yes they do but are too cowardly to use it.
@1Rock777 @SpeakerRyan How'd you all allow it to grow!? #Never2Life2Impeach
Sounds good but Congress is about seven years too late.
You mean to imply that Congress is actually going to try and do something to help the economy? Do it!
Waiting....with popcorn.
I have to ask: who does Ryan fear more, Clinton or Trump? I'd guess Trump.
Oh good.  Something new for #Obama to laugh at. #tcot
Time, and PAST TIME, to rein in the unelected, bureaucracy which cannot be held to account for anything, by anyone
Throw in a 7 year mandatory sunset provision for all federal laws and regulations and you'll have pure gold.
Ryan finally starts to speak up in time for election. After election it will be back to being big gov lapdog.
funny you want to do this now at the end of his presidency. Sounds like you guys are afraid Trump won't play nice
About damn time you did something. Pass it on a veto override before elections & I'll beliveve it. #Trump16 #tcot
@djdoobs @SpeakerRyan And where was this war cry when @POTUS made his "I have a phone & a pen" comment? #toolittletolate
It wasn't re-election time.
what a joke
How? Even Reagan couldn't do that.
