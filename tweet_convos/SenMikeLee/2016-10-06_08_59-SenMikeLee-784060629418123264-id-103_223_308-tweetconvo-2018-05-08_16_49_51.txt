.@SenMikeLee As you are seeking to usurp the states with a federal ban on states' #poker websites, I find that quite laughable. #tcot
Do the proceeds or any kind of major income from igaming go to other programs at all?
iPoker is licensed at the state level. Tax revenue goes to state programs. @SenMikeLee
@SenatorLankford Lee is the architect of the attempted destruction  of our Homeland. ( attempted) let's talk after nov 8.
@SenatorLankford MIke lee have you always been for a borderless country? How does the country administer services?
More than frustrating it is criminal.All Obama' s actions & policies criminal & atrocious. IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES. Nation suffers
Didn't GOP campaign on stopping Obama and the out of control left? What hasn't he got that he wanted? You all have failed us.
We need clean out that rats nest.. They, like the Clinton's know the price of everything and the value of nothing
@karole1945 UR fighting Obama? Hardly. UR working 4 Hillary & Bill 2 show U respect women. I regret donating 2 you. Never again
@AveryChasten @SenatorLankford Just wait until Hillary is in office, compliments of Mike Lee.
Again, you lost.
@SenatorLankford it is quite obvious you didn't fight hard enough now do the job that we are paying you for sick of the excuses
@SenatorLankford 

Support our chosen Republican nominee, Trump, so you won't hv another Soros puppet as POTUS again!

#MAGA

@SenatorLankford

@SenatorLankford so you ready to change parties yet? 
And frustrating is the term you choose to describe this?! #ICANN @SenMikeLee @gatewaypundit
This is BS. u can fight till your blue in face...you need POTUS to sign it. All political garbage. You give 2 craps  just spin
School District 4, Vote Jennifer Graviet if you love Hillary. If Not you might want someone different.
@SenatorLankford Never thought you would be trying to elect HRC either!
Utah’s Senator Mike Lee 1s a b1tch
@SenatorLankford ...Please back Trump...He will work with you to keep the Internet off the auction block.
@robtdfischl @SenatorLankford I never thought we would have to fight our government over destroying our country! Shame on all
You should get out of the bubble called UTAH that you live in. I never imagined I would have to read about a senator complaining
Reminder the real emery to our country's freedom is HRC and the Democrat's and u know it Senator.Stick together support Trump! 
Maybe it is time you step down and suspend campaign. We need unity and you are proving you are not capable of that.
@SenatorLankford  where's your outrage about Clinton emails?  Leave the GOP!  You're with Dems!
@SenatorLankford while you help get Hillary elected does the Internet really matter. She will destroy 1A & 2A and you know it
they are rats. Luckily it's usually those that abandon, that drown first!
@SenatorLankford @HillaryClinton
@SenatorLankford I know you're a shallow little man. Trump will remember you sir  so enjoy it while you can
@SenatorLankford well you've all made it about a likeability contest a personality contest based on BS please now live with it
@SenatorLankford you must be disappointed you cannot give Internet control to your corporate donors
I never thought a man of your caliber would suggest Mr Trump to step down.
will you be supporting bills from the upstanding potty mouths, drunks and porn fiends on the hill?
@SenatorLankford It's bcuz u r use 2 agreeing with them 2 give F16s to Pakistan & selling weapons 2 Saudi Arabia. Right James?!
How look have u & ur puppet master, @MittRomney been waiting to plunge the knife in @realDonaldTrump back? opportunist crybabies
Now we know @SenMikeLee truly is Glen Beck's puppet. #BenedictArnold this will not be forgotten. Coward back stabbing POS @SenatorLankford
Traitorous @GOP like MIKE LEE sold US citizens out for donor$$. HELPED Obama destroy lives/USA - did NOTHING to stop. PALMS OUT
Wait till you try fighting Hillary's executive orders. Good luck. #MAGA
by the way the next thing they're going to try on Trump is accusing him of rape that is the next thing right before the election
I have 3 daughters I have a wife I think the world of them but I'm not going to screw up there future like you want to
And of course you all lost and the internet is no longer here. Time to replace all you losers.
@SenatorLankford did the 4 AGs stop this?
@SenatorLankford Hillary treatment of those who protect her. Just imagine if she became POTUS. https://shar.es/1EWLhD 
u r a disgrace do ur job r step dn prosecute criminals like @POTUS @HilliaryClinton @FBI Comey stop lining ur pockets 
You #GOP are gutless wonders. You have done NOTHING while Obama has torn #America apart. 
#VOTINGTRUMP Because we America!
u r a traitor as far as we r concerned. bet u have said things in the past that were distasteful.  so u should resign w/out pay
we pay your hefty salary, transportation to/from utah, provide u the gold standard health care and u can't stand with our choice
@SenatorLankford
@SenatorLankford do you support Hillary over Trump and what she done to this child it sickens me
@SenatorLankford no one cares about a senator from a state with 100,000 voters
@SenatorLankford your fake you're fights or fake you're a fraud and you fold like a cheap tent your all show and zero go
@SenatorLankford hey I know! How about another bullshit vote to repeal obamacare knowing it will get vetoed! What a great idea!
@SenatorLankford your BFF Cruz lost Mike get over it
unfortunately he hasn't. that's why he's pushing for trump to get out of the race so cruz can get in.
@SenatorLankford your a fraud Mike your fights are fake and you are fake
@SenatorLankford This is the Republican base. These are YOUR voters. Maybe rethink what YOU are saying and stand for.
he stands for greed and power just like the other rino rats.
But you let it happen because you fail at everything and secretly love the Clintons and Bush, who are one and the same.
he loves HRC, WJC, bush family, mittens romney just to name a few because they are for the new world order
@SenatorLankford it's like republicans in congress. Professional whiners and watchers. Inability to lead on anything #wikileak
You guys fight with the President over everything. Obstructive, do-nothings on expense account of tax payers. Smdh
@SenatorLankford thank you for standing up to Obama on this.
Keep up the good fight gentlemen!!!
Is this a done deal?
@SenatorLankford keep the internet free and open #netneutrality
Mike how bout a shout out for @cnstitutionprty and @DarrellCastle maybe help turn this country around, thanks
@RMConservative @SenatorLankford Too late now
It wasn't presented well enough to Americans as ceding U.S. sovereignty to the UN. Simple talk is what most undestand.
President:Sharing is caring,We must do this
Senators: 
Ay 
Ay
Ay 
Ay
Google search:"First Amendment"
Redirect....
#ICANN WTH?!
Its almost as if he should have been impeached before it was too late.
@SenatorLankford what is the President's argument?  How is it positive for the USA according to him?
@Rapunzel_39 @SenMikeLee the corrupt crawl out of the shadows for any hyped up nonsense on Trump. But now we know who they are
RATS.  they r the losers, not us, because i will not vote if they try to take Trump out
@SenatorLankford Some are still missing the forest for the trees...
@SenatorLankford you all let us Dow  with how much shit you let him get away with
.@SenMikeLee @SenatorLankford An effect of unbridled liberalism. Always chipping away at liberty from every angle. GOP leadership is naive.
@SenatorLankford Keep fighting This is unreal!!!
keep fighting you say who he fighting trump or our freedoms he seens like he fighting trump
it had nothing to do with Dt i was telling him to keep fighting regarding the fbi
@SenatorLankford If the UN is in charge of ICANN I'm sure the cost of domain registration is going to go way up in the USA.
Reality is, WE created it, so it's OURS.
BS.
