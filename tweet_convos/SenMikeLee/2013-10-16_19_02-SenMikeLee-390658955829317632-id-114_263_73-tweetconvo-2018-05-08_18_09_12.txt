@SenMikeLee @rac80 They have LIED(Dishonest to nice a word) to get it through, bho has LIED! Keep your MD.,Keep your ins. plan. LIES!
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson Indeed. The math in Obamacare is already causing suffering, but nothing like we will see in the next 12 months.
@SenMikeLee May the God of this land, Jesus Christ bless Mike Lee and his family.
@SenMikeLee sorry but the American people are dumb and don't realize they embraced Communism. #NJSen
Oh brave new world RT @cherokee140: @SenMikeLee sorry but the American people are dumb and don't realize they embraced Communism. #NJSen
@SenMikeLee  @RTHTGakaRoland 

I'm leaning toward them being incompetent and out right liars.
@SenMikeLee Dishonest? Like the strategy you pushed the House to until they said “Yes!l”, and then you said “Not worth shutting gvt down”?
@SenMikeLee I hope obama is impeached...and not just words.
keep going conservatives/wake the GOP up...
@SenMikeLee So many think they are getting something for nothing. They are in for a big surprise.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing with WE THE PEOPLE! Keep up the fight..many of us STAND WITH YOU!
@SenMikeLee and the world is flat too right senator?
@SenMikeLee you have been very helpful lol
@SenMikeLee I look forward to you getting bounced at the nomination convention just like Bob Bennett was.
@SenMikeLee is this your new sappy song. How long does this record play. ADD is running rampant and your voice is fading. #GOPSurrenderSongs
@SenMikeLee Yeah, but the Republicans are the ones that let it pass and get funded. You failed us
@SenMikeLee I'm so proud to be a citizen of Utah, and to have you as my Senator. You, along with @SenRandPaul @tedcruz are the best.
Speaking of dishonest, how long after you were elected as a Tea Bagger conservative did you stop making your house payments?
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee Impeach
@SenMikeLee #tcot @SCF @gopconference All the "disasters" occurring with #Obamacare are well planned strategized and intentional by POTUS
@SenMikeLee @uberstephanie let us just say that they are breaching contracts
@SenMikeLee And don't forget....CORRUPT!!
@SenMikeLee he's a moronic idiot weak and unsure of himself he's a bucket of snot without the bucket u need to start saying it like it is
@SenMikeLee @LdySis. I would say @BarackObama LIED and Four Died in Benghazi plus where is POW Sgt Bergdahl oh right O hates Military
@SenMikeLee I hold u n @SenTedCruz in high regard but please stop bn the nice guys,   John McCain is not a smart brave man with courage.
@SenMikeLee Oh r those the choices?   Im struggling here cuz I can't see were BOTH dont apply,
@SenMikeLee for political reasons because it was an Election year!
@SenMikeLee dishonest for political reasons it was a election year!
@SenMikeLee @LdySis  BOTH!!  Incompetent/Dishonest&Vindictive to TheAmericanPeopleThat MakeThe MoneyTheySo FrivolouslySpendOnThose ThatDon't
@SenMikeLee I believe the Obama administration has been dishonest and incompetent even without ObamaCare. Evil in motion.
@SenMikeLee really? Based on why evidence can you say "Americans" realize anything. Seems a broad over generalization
@SenMikeLee My vote is for all three- dishonest, incompetent, AND stupid.
@SenMikeLee Both!!
@SenMikeLee The SHIZNET will hit the fan w/young lib BO supporters when he takes thei weekend $$.Dems SHUD not rejoice realty is coming.
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea Obamacare will collapse upon itself.  My concern is Amnesty.
@SenMikeLee It is all in their plan for total control
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson rescinding the ACA exemptions would have made the dishonest part clear and unavoidable  Missed opportunity.
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea when the IMF bank comes calling 4 UR- IRA b/c US$ is worthless &the $17T debt quickly becomes $68T by sunrise,?
@SenMikeLee @WashingtonDCTea Please, just once,  call him a lying sob,  he does not pull punches as he attempts to destroy conservatives.
@SenMikeLee BOTH!
@SenMikeLee re OCare- Dems Own it Now-watch them blame the repubs for its failure or maybe even it will be Bush's fault! @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee sir I just wanna say I disagree with you on both counts. Thank you 4ur time. Please support more humanity projects.
@SenMikeLee #Benghazi #IRS #NSA #GM #Fast&Furious #EPA #NLRB #Reset #Israel #Syria #Iran #SEIU  #Zimmerman #ACORN #VanJones #Transparency
@SenMikeLee Ran out of space not even halfway through #DishonestIncompetent
@SenMikeLee Expect liberal left to lie about fdetails about laws passed, but not conservatives leaders. Big reason to rid Congress of RINOS.
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 Which is exactly why U should have let the left own all 100% of it. Then U probably win on not raisingDebtLimit
@SenMikeLee Are you describing the Teabags & yourself when you say "dishonest & incompetent"? If so I agree completely.
@SenMikeLee Dishonest. @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader @RepPeteKing Agree w/Dims Absolve Selves of Responsibility Anoint O Emperor & Forget God
@SenMikeLee Both
@SenMikeLee @lheal both
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson U act like u r defending a democracy rather than a republic.....what gives?
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson I'd say both!
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson U R fighting like u r preserving a democracy rather than a Republic.....WTH? Restore the @republicanrock
@SenMikeLee @Texgalleslie I'd go for both!
@contrarian11 Me too! @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee
keep up the good fight @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee go fuck yourself!
@SenMikeLee I believe it was both, but I honestly don't think they even know the difference between the two anymore.
@SenMikeLee fuck you!
@SenMikeLee its so embarrassing to vote for  reb ,there nothing but democrats ,who are the scourge of the earth
@SenMikeLee cant beat media backed regime as a fractured minority and no organization.
@SenMikeLee only way 2 turn this into a possible salvage is to unify in house and senate prior to next debt ceiling battle.
@SenMikeLee You and Cruz are making fools of yourselves. When you say "American People" you are speaking for less than 20% of the country.
@SenMikeLee both. So not give up the fight
@SenMikeLee They still don't see it. When they do, they will continue to support this corrupt idiot like they always do...
@SenMikeLee I like to use simple terms, Language he'e a LIAR, Fraud...
You & @SenTedCruz have my everlasting admiration. You did the right thing. Thank you. @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee But Senator, no one is doing anything about it except you, Cruz, and a few others.  The obvious corruption is tragic.
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson Just more GOP bullshit!
@SenMikeLee and for a few billion in Paducah the @Senate_GOPs can be bought. sell it some where else Mike. waiting for new party to rep me.
@SenMikeLee Our Constitution states: Duties, Imposts & Excises shall be uniform throughout the U.S.  Obamacare tax fees, r not uniform.
@SenMikeLee @PhilDeCarolis Lt. Gov. Dewhurst Calls for Obama’s Impeachment http://www.tatoott1009.com/2013/10/16/calls-for-obamas-impeachment/ …
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz FIX the obamacare website,  see how many truly sign up once they see premiums, deds, copays... #DOA, #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz the only winners in ObamaCare are the insurers.. working class/small buisness loses
@SenMikeLee This may sound cold but anyone who didn't realize that before the last election deserves Obamacare.
@SenMikeLee BTW I have setup another meeting with @SarahPalinUSA and her people to go over options on TV shows and books.
@SenMikeLee sorry you and a few others seem to be the only ones who remember the people in this country, we are watching #timetocleanhouse
.@SenMikeLee Someone has been dishonest or incompetent, but not the admin. His name rhymes with Sike Pee.
@SenMikeLee - unfortunately, I believe those still aboard the good ship "Hope&Change" are incapable of such consciousness.
@SenMikeLee I have always realized that, unfortunately.. now there is proof! #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee When the Obamacare really goes off. All the FLEAS will be looking for a back to jump on
@SenMikeLee Rich to hear a Tea Partier talking about dishonesty and incompetence.
@SenMikeLee Both, hands down.  President 1 People 0.  Lose, lose.
@SenMikeLee thank you for opening the eyes of American I hope you still have fight left in you Utah is proud to have you
@SenMikeLee Show a youtube video of a dancing monkey or something
@SenMikeLee both
@SenMikeLee Man have something creative to say. You just are repeating lines.
.@SenMikeLee are you open about your mental handicap or are you in the closet about that
@SenMikeLee @morris_turner I would say...BOTH !!!
@SenMikeLee ...or sabotaged.
@SenMikeLee Dishonest? Incompetent? Sounds like Cruz & Lee to me (and to your GOP Senate colleagues, too).
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your vote tonight.
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson May be ya`ll do`nt ned to defund #obamacare. We will do it for you by not buying into it.
@SenMikeLee Some member in the GOP have been dishonest also which is really troubling....
@SenMikeLee both and then some.
@SenMikeLee what republicans are voting yea?
@SenMikeLee both
@SenMikeLee  19 r's vote yes .........it will pass @seanhannity
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson don't worry we won't forget who fought and who folded.
@SenMikeLee @EWErickson Says the guy that just helped incompetently shut down the government.
@SenMikeLee both
