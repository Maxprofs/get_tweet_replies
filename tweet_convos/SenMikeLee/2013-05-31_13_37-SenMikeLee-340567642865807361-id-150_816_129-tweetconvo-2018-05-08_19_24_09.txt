I would rather see us de-fund the UN @SenMikeLee and stop sending money to those that hate us. @ktbis244
@OnalaskaGarry @SenMikeLee sounds good to me!!!
@ktbis244 @OnalaskaGarry @SenMikeLee - move UN from our country & at least cut back our contribution. We pay the most & for what?
@SenMikeLee definitely.
@SenMikeLee @restoremerica So, they don't keep receipts either?

If people think IRS is corrupt, the UN is worse. Small gov't: less spending. #tcot #tlot
@ShnitZee @SenMikeLee If American people can't trust their own politicians, why trust international politicians? END UN $. #tcot #tlot
“@RonPaul2012FTW: @senmikelee a better idea would be to get the #UN to fund US state militia batteries. Think they'll go for it? Excellent!
.Why @SenMikeLee would you suggest we just track and report the billions of US taxpayer dollars sent to UN? Waste of our money. @SenTedCruz
@stacyhyatt @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 

Why play small ball? Go bigger. Create huge, stark contrasts.

#tcot #tlot
@JAndrewPeak what’s the purpose in tracking wasted money! The UN attacks our sovereignty on an ongoing basis!  @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz
@stacyhyatt @SenTedCruz We're broke! Thought ML knew that! Go ahead - print more money:(( Stiffen spine @SenMikeLee U can do it! #tcot #tlot
@SenMikeLee @restoremerica I'll Retweet But would you at least Get us the Hell out of the U.N. Quit Giving OUR MONEY to OUR ENEMIES
@joebrentgreer @SenMikeLee

@restoremerica @SenMikeLee And If Obama and McCain get their way were going to Fund A Lot More
@SenMikeLee @wanttruth I have a better idea.  Evict UN, save lots of money.  Use the facility 2 house homeless vets &  $$$ to care for them.
@DarlaQuinn3  Formula 2 SAVE Future of USA=Conservative Candidates (NOT Dem or GOP) + ABSENCE of Voter Fraud http://northamericanlawcenter.org/notice-to-congressional-election-certification …
@SenMikeLee @FiscalConservat Don't send money to #UN period!
@SenMikeLee Time to kick the UN off US soil so we can go our way unhindered by globalist plans.
@SenMikeLee @MoberlyG Actually I think we should STOP sending money to the Anti-freedom UN. Get the UN Out of the US & the US out of the UN.
@SenMikeLee Don't give the UN one penny more and give them the boot instead!
@SenMikeLee pretty weak stand. Why not do something about it instead of watching our country undermined?
@SenMikeLee WHY is the money not tracked???
@SenMikeLee PLEASE RETWEET IF YOU THINK OUR TROOPS DESERVE HOT MEALS!
@SenMikeLee The US out of the UN and the UN out of the US.
@SenMikeLee @seesayusa or simply get us out of the UN, stop sending them a dime, send them packing off of our shores? Just a thought!
@SenMikeLee @pikester45 Should be "a given" - not a question.
.@mooretommyh @SenMikeLee @lsferguson The UN may be corrupt but keeping our friends close and our enemies even closer is a good idea.
@SenMikeLee the UN has outgrown any useful purpose and now is nothing more than a means of forcing nations into submission
@SenMikeLee Why are paying the UN anything?? @a3auntie
@SenMikeLee We should track the millions of guns that are threatening the public's safety before you or I , or yours or mine become victims.
@SenMikeLee How about we grow a pair and not fund them at all!
@SenMikeLee @fitzfam2000 We you lent be sending any to the UN. We need to get out
@SenMikeLee @WickedHuntress No. No. No. END U.N. funding. Mike Lee, U R asking the wrong question. Go big or retire.

@SenMikeLee @jkolsen We should be OUT of the fruit and nut show at the UN. Embarrassing that we give them money.
@BettinaVLA @SenMikeLee Agree about out of the UN but please don't insult fruit & nuts because that's what we grow.
@jkolsen @SenMikeLee Sorry, can I call them flakes, instead?
@BettinaVLA @SenMikeLee That's pretty mild. They're basically leeches.
@SenMikeLee BIG BROTHER IS TRACKING EVERY MOVE OF TAXPAYING CITIZENS WHY NOT THE ASSININE UN?
@angelfitzpat51 @SenMikeLee 
I like your way
@SenMikeLee WE  shldn't be giving $billions 2 UN 2 begin with & furthermore, shouldn't even allow them on our soil! Get rid of corrupt UN!
@SenMikeLee The UN is corrupt! American tax dollars are wasted on that corruption! Its time to stop &  take care of the American people!
@Revenant0202 @SenMikeLee 
USELESS NATIONS. If we cut our support by 50% they would cease to exist  #tcot #tgdn #CTOT #lnyhbt
@SenMikeLee @Doc_JJK Insanity that we don't..Just how incompetent are we?
@SenMikeLee @grampachap #UN and how much taxes that churches pay... Oh wait. That is 0. Because that makes sense.
@SenMikeLee you mean actually get a receipt?
@SenMikeLee Defund the UN - They are completely worthless. Expel them from US soil. Secure the border. Defend the Constitution. #TCOT #NRA
@SenMikeLee @gop votes against JOBS by voting NO on Infrastructure Bill. What do U care, U got one? Repubs hate when our Nation prospers
@SenMikeLee I do not agree $$ to the UN should cease immediately
@SenMikeLee @MKbrw Use Twitter like - a lot - here because without no real press in USA, we know nothing about this outrage.
@SenMikeLee @MKbrw So use Twitter here and spread the info about Obama's refusal to report his UN money on behalf of USA taxpayers.
@SenMikeLee @MKbrw This is a very big issue we conserves are just learning about on Twitter thanks to you. Insane that we don't know more.
@SenMikeLee  Not "should"...must. We spend as though the supply of money is endless.
@SenMikeLee @dadavis65 I'm tired of my $ being sent 2 countries that ridicule us or want 2 kill us.  Enough already.  Charity begins at home
@LoriBlaney @SenMikeLee You'll get no arguement from me
@SenMikeLee @stephan96391239 please get the US out of the UN and the UN out of the US
@SenMikeLee Some things R just common sense
@SenMikeLee  heartily agree!
@SenMikeLee 
Most households maintain a simple rule.... You cant spend money you don't have. When you do, debt follows.
@SenMikeLee @MrsVerCrouse At least!! Shouldn't the $ go where they're needed not the UN?
@SenMikeLee taxpayers should not be subsidizing the anti-American UN that is now merely a tool of Liberals to subvert Congress!
You mean we aren't tracking it already?!!  @SenMikeLee
@Jacquie0415 @SenMikeLee Expel the UN and turn the building into a giant transportation hub to ease lives of New Yorkers. Privately funded.
@SenMikeLee If they hate us then we should send nothing. #followback
@SenMikeLee Absolutely Senator Lee! I completely agree with you. I also believe that we separate from the UN until common sense prevails!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 And every tribal leader in Afghanistan!
@SenMikeLee we should get out of the UN. Shut down their Hqts. Send them packing. Have they stopped one war. World peace my ass. Waste of $$
@SenMikeLee @trgore   Why don't we stop tracking it and just plain stop it. We should charge a fee for our facilities to all member states.
@SenMikeLee make a difference STOP the $ to the U.N.
@SenMikeLee @gibletjones No need to track our money if we just stop giving UN our money. Kick UN out of USA!
@KnownAsJessie @gibletjones @SenMikeLee how about tossing the UN out do US altogether.  What have they DONE for us?
@KnownAsJessie @gibletjones @SenMikeLee how many votes can we always count on, besides Israel?
@SenMikeLee If in our interest to fund UN, track & report.If $$ is used against us, then cut funding. Seems simple enough to me.
@SenMikeLee Dude, the jokes on them cos I don't even pay G-ddamn taxes!
@SenMikeLee Hells yeah!
@SenMikeLee @Gerilenn We need to get Out of the UN..they are Not Our friends!  No money should go to them!
@__DragonWings__ @SenMikeLee I totally agree.  We are a sovereign nation and don't need them.
@SenMikeLee I believe we should STOP hosting UN and STOP aid to hostile countries. Can't spell Unethical without the UN.
“@IrishTea1: @SenMikeLee I believe we should STOP hosting UN and STOP aid to hostile countries.”. Get the UN out of the US!
@SenMikeLee Why do we continue to provide support for UN? So banana republics and terrorist states can vote against us 100% of the time?
@SenMikeLee I just want it cut OUT! No funding for UN & they can take their criminal enterprise 2 a 3rd world country! Most of members from
@SenMikeLee @jjauthor We need to totally defund the UN

@SenMikeLee the un is a farce
@SenMikeLee Why not report about the Monetary System & how the debt is created. Y deficit is bigger than GDP?
@SenMikeLee @jjauthor ppl should be asking how much of my tax dollar is used to protect poppy fields in afganistan which ends up on streets
@SenMikeLee Shouldn't DC be tracking every single penny... seein how that's our money?
@SenMikeLee How about leave the UN and get the UN building out of this country
@SenMikeLee @jjauthor This is the next stop for the POTUS; UN General with new title World President.
@senmikelee @jjauthor Better yet, let's get out of the UN altogether. Nothing but antiSemitic Islamic Global Domination/NWO.
@SenMikeLee Obama supports the UN because it is the only organization more useless than his!
@jjauthor @SenMikeLee Wow not sure I agree on that its so darn close as to which is the most pathetic but I still give the edge to Obama
@SenMikeLee @lanele123 stop sending billions to other countries for five yrs and get our Econ in check. It don't seen hard to figure out.

@SenMikeLee @lanele123 govt buildings need cleaned govt cars need to be washed. Send investigators at 4 am to check on these people
@SenMikeLee @lanele123 elderly need roofs replaced floors fixed fences mended grass mowed handicapped need ramps built floors fixed
@SenMikeLee @lanele123 make welfare recp work 40 hrs a seek for beni's if they're not handicapped or elderly.
@SenMikeLee @lanele123 boot their asses to the curb. Use un building to house and retrain soldiers to re enter society
@SenMikeLee @lanele123 totally.
@SenMikeLee and that back tracked money should go to the people
@SenMikeLee I hate to say it, bit what has Israel done for the US.... EVER? nothing.
@SenMikeLee @EmfingerSScout   We should not send any money to the UN, we should tell them to get off of our soil.
@SenMikeLee @EmfingerSScout How can Senate sit by and watch Obama give Phones to illegals and take meals from Military?
@SenMikeLee Not good enough. Let's get out of the U.N. and throw out all of these lying, thieving immoral criminal "untouchables"
@SenMikeLee @ds_pence wow right on top of things there Sen
@SenMikeLee we shouldn't send any $ anywhere & use that $ for our veterans & are made top priority & given all their benefits disgraceful!!
@SenMikeLee And that 100 + million to Syrian "freedom fighters" after Netanyahu said they are al Qaeda? Like #Benghazi, we arm our enemies.
@SenMikeLee I thought Congress was in control of $$? How did 2 bil go to TMB, and now Kerry wants 4 billion for Hamas, a terrorist state?
@SenMikeLee   we need to kick the UN OUT OF USA DEAR REP LEE ..IT BRINGS US SPIES/ TERRORISTS ALL UNDER COVER OF USELESS UN #TCOT #TGDN #GOP
@SenMikeLee meanwhile Sgt Bergdahl continues to wait for you to ask for his freedom #ebringbowehome why not RT that Mike
@SenMikeLee @medpac Please defund, leave the UN and boot them out of the US!
@SenMikeLee why not get out of the united nations altogether. The u.n. has outlived its usefulness.
@SenMikeLee I'd be interested to see how much the US sent in $$ or aid to Countries who are now using that same support against the US
@SenMikeLee @MorelHunting We don't need the UN they want One World Order . Not negotiable here in America. get out Now #Freedom

@SenMikeLee We shouldn't give un money! Also, I'm disgusted by you and Rand Paul working behind scenes to help Rubio move Gang 8 bill!
@SenMikeLee Even still allowing the #UN to operate here, let alone give 'em BILLIONS, shows how gutless & dysfunctional our #gov is. #tcot
@SenMikeLee I think we should get out of UN Before BHO w/his Executive Orders puts Our Beloved America under the UN
@SenMikeLee @BettinaVLA billions? I think we've safely sent trillions.
@SenMikeLee we can't track a couple thousand guns we send to Mexican cartels... ;-)
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 Better yet, the US should pull out of the UN and simply mind its own business.
@SenMikeLee @fbterpfan - We shouldn't be sending a NICKEL to the UN! They've become an international TERRORIST organization!
@55cmvs @SenMikeLee Agreed!!!!!! Kick them out of the US!!!!!
@SenMikeLee @redlegwife13 We need to get out of the UN.
We should also track the billions in foreign aid.. Or better yet, end most of it @SenMikeLee @dontaggart
@ConservativeSyn @SenMikeLee agreed.  friends we need to buy, aren't friends
@SenMikeLee This is a must!
@SenMikeLee @mrclean2012 as a final audit before we stop housing and funding the UN.
@SenMikeLee ABSOLUTELY WE SHOULD REPORT EVERY CENT THAT WE GIVE THE UN! We must stop allowing the UN TO DICTATE US POLICY.#STOPUN #tcot #USA
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson We need to get out of the UN. It is not a global humanitarian organization any longer. Bias and purpose.
@SenMikeLee @AmyKremer I don't think we should send billions of dollars to #UN in the first place!
@craftylady55 @SenMikeLee @AmyKremer amen!!!
@SenMikeLee at least! Amazing that we don't
@SenMikeLee @4inspiration2 We should evict UN and use the complex to house homeless vets.
@SenMikeLee How about we start tracking the Billion$$ in Corporate subsidies first? http://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2012/08/20/where-to-cut-the-federal-budget-start-by-killing-corporate-welfare/ …
@SenMikeLee Hmm. How about we don't track it and more importantly we don't send anything to the UN?
@SenMikeLee How about we stop wasting U.S. taxpayer $$on the UN and kick them out of the country?!
Ok. I won't tell you...the gov't isn't tracking where they spend r $. Budgeting is for peons-n I feel peed on @JulieQBarnett :-) #ccot #tcot
@SenMikeLee  get out of UN all together
@SenMikeLee @Rhondako Senator UR a Republican, don't U know GOV'T was created ONLY 4 Defense & Judicial System, not 2 give 2 other countries
@SenMikeLee @Rhondako Senator when U take $ from people forcefully (ie. taxes) & give it 2 others it's not charity it's theft from taxpayers
@SenMikeLee @Rhondako Senator you have it 100% wrong. Why send $ out of the USA & put MY country into further debt. Stop all payments NOW!!!
.@SenMikeLee @MassRon .It's way past time that the US stopped funding the charade that the UN has become.
@SenMikeLee @LibertySurfer I would prefer eviction. They are mostly Arabic/Islamic anyway. Let them pay for the party.
@SenMikeLee 

Sir>UN is tool NWO advocates R using 2 undermine USA Sovereignty><2011 Libya Humanitarian Intervention
@SenMikeLee you Rs refuse to even let us pay UN dues. UN could be an effective org for the world if people like you would get out of the way
@SenMikeLee @RepStaceNelson and the billions wasted everywhere else
@dyehjr @SenMikeLee Those we don't need to track, but C-U-T!
@SenMikeLee We don't need the un they can go to france and we don't even know where the money goes figures Gov. out of control
@SenMikeLee ok, but only after we start tracking all political contributions
@SenMikeLee @Rhondako what we should do is get out of the U.N., it's full of haters of America and Israel.
@SenMikeLee Better yet, why don't we kick the UN out of the US?
Nope. Stop all funds. MT“@SenMikeLee: if you agree that US should at least track & report the billions of taxpayer dollars we send to #UN"
@JDtheBard @SenMikeLee And evict them from US soil.
