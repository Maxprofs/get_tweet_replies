@SenMikeLee Many ppl are really angry....
@SenMikeLee @fatima_madsen We'll see how much you can get them to bend curve.
@SenMikeLee @Stealth_Patriot Change is coming, that's cute!
@SenMikeLee http://www.teaparty.org/sen-mike-lee-change-coming-washington-73448/ … get rid of RINO Boehner as speaker, & #impeachobama only way to change to better.
@SenMikeLee Squandering the new Congress' first year by funding government for a full year isn't change, same crap from the Democrats
@SenMikeLee I hope so , and I have a question for you are you running for president , you'd be a great one , God Bless and Merry Christmas
@SenMikeLee @feedinup I hope you're right, Senator!  It depends upon us--We, the People!!  We MUST stay on your colleagues like glue!!
@veriphile @SenMikeLee ...an AUTHENTIC Fundamental Transformation is Required, Hope Sen Lee is Right
@feedinup @SenMikeLee Me, too!!
@SenMikeLee @UnPoliticalPrty Talk is cheap and everyone promises change. Who plans on actually delivering?
@SenMikeLee @Ontly A good start would be replacing Boehner.
@SenMikeLee republicans had better straighten up their act. We need an opposition party or no parties at all.
@SenMikeLee @HuntleyTeaParty I'll believe it when I see it. 6 years ago it was Obama who said change was coming. He was right.
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 Sir, get rid of baseline budgeting. It is exploding our spending unnecessarily.
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 I hope so Sen Lee! Keep up the fight
@SenMikeLee @libertylady44 - We hope that is true Mike, but with RINO @mitchmcconnell_ in charge, change may never happen! #tcot
@SenMikeLee I am skeptical of "hope & change". How about some true fiscal conservatism instead?
@SenMikeLee @presbo I very seriously doubt that, O's still President, #ImpeachObama
@LindaDLee2 @SenMikeLee That would be great
@SenMikeLee @ConnieBAustin Cruz is going to start acting like a first term Senator?
@SenMikeLee Can't wait to see proof of that come January 12th, Senator. #WeThePeople are watching.
@SenMikeLee  we'll see, there has been no leadership from McConnell or Boehner and I don't see that changing.
@SenMikeLee When? America spoke last Nov.Obama said, I heard nothing!
@SenMikeLee enjoy what you think is change ...remember you only have 2  years..@JonVince1
@SenMikeLee Jon Huntsman's Father: Sen. Lee 'An Embarrassment To Utah' @TPM http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/jon-huntsman-mike-lee-utah-embarrassment …
@SenMikeLee whats wrong with America is we got lazy & let them take over & they got Obama in
@SenMikeLee @paulbenedict7 sure hope so!
@SenMikeLee  which means, change will have to come *despite* the failure of the Republican leadership in Congress.
@SenMikeLee I hope so,but honestly, their don't seem to be a way of stopping the madness, with his EO's and Memorandum's & Corruption!
@SenMikeLee  so basically you're going to try to repay the Koch Brothers and your other cronies.  You are a disgrace to the State of Utah!
@SenMikeLee I hope you are right
@SenMikeLee @AllenEllis14  like all politicians, you talk a good game.  Time to back it up with action.
@SenMikeLee @VengeanceIsOurs You and Senator Cruz are to be commended and supported. May your colleagues join you in #RealReform
@SenMikeLee  North Korea could find Lois Lerner's emails in 30 minutes
@SenMikeLee @NewCongress4NE let's hope so
@SenMikeLee I fear that without new leadership in Senate & House, nothing will really change. McConnell & Boehner are both corrupt.
@SenMikeLee To change will require a different Republican Party or a new Conservative party. Republicrats want larger Gov,amnesty, Obamacare
@SenMikeLee , Also, you all need to remember that WE THE PEOPLE put you ladies and gents in office and we ARE paying attention.
@SenMikeLee Unless the change is #mcconnel & #boehner NOT getting elected to leadership......#NothingWillChange
@SenMikeLee when all our representatives return to running things on the founding CHRISTIAN principles, change will happen.
“@SenMikeLee: The last few weeks of Congress perfectly rep everything wrong w/ Wash. But change is coming: http://ow.ly/G5dWh  #utpol” 
@SenMikeLee @cbbreeze The newly elected, for the most part, haven't lived up to their "promises"; will feel Patriots' wrath in 2016!
America is counting on you----------->@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @BeckyJoSpray I support you, a few others, but it's hard for me to believe that anybody in DC. knows how disgusted people are.
@SenMikeLee @BeckyJoSpray Seeing is believing!
@SenMikeLee I wish I believed  that Mike but Boehner & McConnell just proved they can't be trusted .
@SenMikeLee we need a new speaker.
@SenMikeLee heard that one before..
@SenMikeLee Yes sir it is. Thank You for staying the course.
@SenMikeLee u can start by publicly shaming the entire Utah US house members for their cromnibus yes votes
@SenMikeLee Yes Mikey, change is a comin' soon. Unemployment down, wages up, Healthcare for the poor, War over, Now Cuba!! Change comin'.
@SenMikeLee I seriously hope so. I am losing faith in the Repub party. We need to get America back!
@SenMikeLee I sure the hell hope so.  Congress looks like a bunch of morons that can't decide what to do. WE THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED IF IT!
I have faith in @SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee @GenGSPatton  BLAH BLAH BLAH ITS ALWAYS TH SAME OL SONG AND DANCE, YOU ALL NEED 2 DEVELOP A SENSE OF URGENCY .A NAT. CRISIS U NO
@SenMikeLee I hope so, I truly do.  But running out of hope.  Keep being strong and maybe more will join you.
@SenMikeLee @utahpolitics I agree, perfectly represented everything wrong, and there you are doing it. 

Everything. Wrong. You.
@SenMikeLee @GenGSPatton yeah we will actually vote for 2nd party candidates now and stop buying yalls lies. Gop is done.
@SenMikeLee @GenGSPatton The American People are coming to change it.  And we're pissed.
@SenMikeLee We will believe it when we see it. We have been fed so much crap by politicians, that no one has faith.
@SenMikeLee Really, Mike?  All we have seen so far is selling out the American people.
@SenMikeLee Yes it is.  It comes in January, 2015.  More of it comes in January, 2017.  Still more in January, 2019.  And you are helping.
@SenMikeLee I pray that change is coming because if it doesn't, I fear we are done for!
@SenMikeLee Mike, I love you conservative Senators! Keep up the GREAT WORK for the Nation!
@SenMikeLee @claramarks Sure change is coming,lmao.We Westpac Combat watched DC promise BS.@vcortesusmc @hitman0321 @Jim_Raue  I like U Lee
@SenMikeLee @claramarks @vcortesusmc @hitman0321 @Jim_Raue Your a ok Man SenLee.I'm 65, who UFooling @GOP  nothing but LIARS too.
@SenMikeLee don't  believe you. All you are is Ted Cruz shadow. You have no solutions and only follow what he does. He's just a smart-ass.
@SenMikeLee if lawmakers don't realize what the Dodd-Frank bypass means their either stupid or psychopaths.  Past history tells me latter
@SenMikeLee hope your right. Many of us conservative Americans are tired of the BS if the #GOP establishment.
@SenMikeLee @_Jay_King CHANGE. The Obama slogan. I see a bad omen here
@SenMikeLee sorry Mike.  If spending bill was struck down b/c of ACA,amnesty, Dodd-Frank I'd say there's change but it's business as usual
@SenMikeLee I want to believe Mike, but with Mitch & Boehner in charge, there will be none. If we don't ROLL BACK some of what's been done..
@SenMikeLee 
Fun Fact:
You're what's wrong with Congress.
@SenMikeLee ..Hey FatAss 
@SenMikeLee You are a tubby, pasty disaster. #adhominem
@SenMikeLee you and Ted Cruz give me hope! God bless both of you!
"@SenMikeLee For the first time in a long time, help for working families is on the way."
Amen!
@SenMikeLee i'm one of your constituents, but I don't hold your optimism! Hatch and Stewart voted for the omnibus! brush up your resume!
@SenMikeLee I sure as heck hope so. I'm so disgusted with DC. Need more like you & @SenTedCruz. Too few, so sad. What happened to Patriots?
@SenMikeLee We are Not holding our breath on your Change. 1st move GOP has given away your Power of the Budget. Same stuff different day.
@SenMikeLee Please Sen Lee I hope you are correct; Remove McConnell and Boehner from power to start
@SenMikeLee Mike, other GOP refuse to answer. What's the GOP's preferred immigration reform policy? Pls provide a link to it. Thanks.
@SenMikeLee Keep your promise. We are counting on you. Actually, we are pretty desperate.
@SenMikeLee it doesn't feel like it on this end. Current GOP leaders remind me of mid-2000's in every bad way there is
@SenMikeLee boy do we need it.  Why the H did you give that bastard 9 months?
@SenMikeLee Please, slap the damn republicans around, they have lost their freakin minds. Oh, should I call em repugnocrats?
@SenMikeLee repugnocrat is a republican that's morphed into a democrat. in other words a repugnant republican with liberal beliefs.
@SenMikeLee @HouseGOP @SpeakerBoehner started off really really really badly. Didn't help you guys cause any. #DisllusionedAmerican
@SenMikeLee So... McConnell & Boehner are standing down. Fantastic news!
@SenMikeLee Sounds good, we want Trey Gowdy to take over for John " Cry Baby" Boehner, to start!
@SenMikeLee Good to here because this has been HELL
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU, Senator. You are a statesman.
@SenMikeLee KEEP ON JAMMIN MIKE ! WHEN YOU GET SERIOUS ABOUT REMOVING THE #TERRORIST, USE THIS TOOL ! BIRTH #ID FRAUD
@SenMikeLee senator Lee..who will lead us?
@SenMikeLee Never give up!! Never give in!!
@SenMikeLee how about restoring voting rights to felons or allowing a majority of votes to earn a majority of seats?
@indictGW @SenMikeLee Part of the punishment of committing a felony is to lose voting rights. Should've thought about that B4 the crime.
@1OKCupcake @SenMikeLee Nowhere in the Constitution does it say criminals lose voting rights.The poor more likely to suffer this consequence
@indictGW @SenMikeLee 14th amendment leaves it up to states. Criminals know it's the punishment--it's not like it's a surprise.
@1OKCupcake @SenMikeLee most felonies nonviolent crimes..stem from the drug war. 10% of blacks can't vote. GOP design
@indictGW What does that have to do with anything?  Victims of crimes R never made whole again.  Criminals know the law & if voting was
@1OKCupcake what does racist sentencing, which disenfranchised 10% of the black vote have to do w/ universal suffrage?EVERYTHING. GOP design
@indictGW Sentencing is not racist. Do the crime--do the time.  Victims r never made whole--why not fight for the worthwhile:  The victims
@SenMikeLee I hope so you are one of the few we trust thank you
