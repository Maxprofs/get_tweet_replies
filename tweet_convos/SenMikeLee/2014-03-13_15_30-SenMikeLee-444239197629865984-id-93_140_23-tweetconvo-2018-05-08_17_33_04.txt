@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun I think he should be given a prayer rug, koran, and bowl of humus; put in Guantanimo and water boarded daily
@SenMikeLee #AZ Democrats are running for cover!  #Obamacare albatross getting too heavy!
@noprezzie2012 @SenMikeLee #azgop needs to use this as a strategy.
@SenMikeLee @wyverncreature   His delay is illegal, it is designed to help Dems get reelected, and is a slap in Congress' face!
@SenMikeLee @ItsJustJill he DID build that!
@SenMikeLee @JamesAnjanette I think he needs to dump it completely, my son is having to pay 5X as much for less.
@SenMikeLee #ImpeachBarry
@SenMikeLee @ItsJustJill I dislike snakes
@SenMikeLee @ItsJustJill Nothing but@Politics designed to help@the Dems in upcoming Nov elections. It won't work!
@SenMikeLee  This president believes he is KING and he is slippery. Working stiff does not have an out.  FAMILIES SUFFER.
I would say that is a FELONY. How about you? @SenMikeLee @MonteBringle
@SenMikeLee it stinks. Obama is lawless with his changing the law on his own.
@SenMikeLee @MDL67 it is sneaky just like all he does.
@SenMikeLee @FredZeppelin12 Typical sneaky lawbreaking... Again! What about the internet handoff???
@SenMikeLee @Mike_Beacham i think its more pathetic when our elected officials wont impeach him
@SenMikeLee @Mike_Beacham Obama doesn't want to have to be accountable before the elections
@SenMikeLee Twitter would suspend me if I responded to this question honestly.  Suffice to say I don'think much of it at all. @Mike_Beacham
@SenMikeLee More to the point is what is Congress going to do about it?
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun I would like him to explain how we can keep our policy cancelled because of mandates Dec 1, 2013.
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun Would you like to know what the the rest of the world thinks about your president?
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun http://www.house-press.com/?p=4032&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter …
@SenMikeLee @LessGovMoreFun JUST TRYING TO KEEP HIS CRONIES IN OFFICE! SEE RIGHT THROUGH THAT! TRANSPARENCY AT LAST!
@SenMikeLee #defundobamacare #FullRepeal
@SenMikeLee guess you can teach old dog eaters new tricks
@SenMikeLee @NewCongress4NE How many people will it affect?
@senmikelee OBfuSkating on individual mandate..
@SenMikeLee this whole damn thing is designed to force to single payer system; B.O. gave a speech back in 2003 stating that's what he wanted
@SenMikeLee Everything he does hides truth from voters to elect more Marxists into office. Read RULES FOR RADICALS & Cloward-Piven.
@SenMikeLee this and every other #obama change in laws act should be litigated post haste to SCOTUS and #obama should be impeached
@SenMikeLee REPEAL/DEFUND/DESTROY #obamacare #defundobamacare
@SenMikeLee would anyone expect anything else from him.
@SenMikeLee @InaudibleNoise Does the suggestion of tar and feathers and wood rail bring anything to mind?
@SenMikeLee   Illegal like the rest of the buttclown's actions to put off getting hammered in the coming election cycle.  #ImpeachObama
@SenMikeLee The President's job is to see to it that the law is faithfully executed--NOT to edit it as his political needs see fit.
.@SenMikeLee I think since the plan I could afford is gone (thanks to Obama), my choice is $$$ or newly uninsured. Thanks, #Democrats.
@SenMikeLee @BraveLad #Obamacare #MakeDCListen um, consistent with a disingenuous relationship w/American citizens that began day #1 #hoax#
@SenMikeLee He can't do anything honestly. He has to do it in secret. Obama is a serial Liar and Cheat. He Can't be trusted.
@SenMikeLee Unlawful and he is unworthy to hold the office. He is disconnected from reality. Ruination of our great nation is on him.
@SenMikeLee I'm alright with it
@SenMikeLee I think you guys have lost you minds.
@SenMikeLee I think all the libbies & RINOs owe @SenTedCruz an apology
@SenMikeLee President hiding his signature tax & spend legislation to make sure it's roots run deep before dem heads roll in Nov & in 2016.
@SenMikeLee @BraveLad Just a ploy until after the elections . Just like they did with everything the last election .
@SenMikeLee The law of the land has become just like the Syrian red line. Maybe Putin can save the day again? Oh just blame the GOP... again
@SenMikeLee Sickening. Based on Supreme Court case presented by WH, to now delay this should make act null and void. It's actually sleazy.
@SenMikeLee potus is just trying to help the dems in the midterms?  Right?
@SenMikeLee - Very transparent of him.
@SenMikeLee - what do you think about doing something but talk about it?  Take Action against this guy Mr lee or else you are useless
@SenMikeLee repeal impeach
@SenMikeLee  I think he thinks he's a king. However, I'm pretty upset at the House for not impeaching this clown and at the Senate as well!!
@SenMikeLee Thought individual mandate critical to ACA viability. Now anyone can opt out with any lame excuse and no penalty/tax. Some joke!
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler :Not surprised.
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler Secretive government law delays + selectively enforced laws = corruption & discrimination.
@SenMikeLee impeach him. What are waiting for?
@SenMikeLee The ObamaCare delays are ALL politically motivated. Trying to protect the Democrats from that disaster won't work.
@SenMikeLee unconstitutional!
@SenMikeLee If it's "secretive" how did you find out? How about you working with AND respecting the MAN in the Oval Office, you dimwit!!!
@SenMikeLee I think it's par for the course. When are you guys going to quit playing games and push the House for impeachment charges???
@SenMikeLee I think if only people would work together to make it better instead of just playing politics, we could have a better system.
@SenMikeLee Let's just say that it doesn't go well with his "transparent administration" promise.
What do you think of people who take out home equity loans, then secretively quit making their mortgage payments? #ShortSeller 
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee We need to win back the Senate in November, keep the House and get a 2/3's vote to nullify the whole law!
@SenMikeLee @greggutfeld @DanaPerino @AndreaTantaros @BretBaier I dont know why conserv media isnt highlighting the irony after bashing Cruz
@SenMikeLee ILLEGAL
@SenMikeLee unfair.  Some States go along. Others decided not to.
@SenMikeLee Like I said yesterday @SenTedCruz  should have asked for three year delay, then the government wouldn't have shut down. #tcot
@SenMikeLee The same thing I think of the man occupying the White House You 
are correct! I don't like either!!
@SenMikeLee impeach
@SenMikeLee Why not...everything else is secretive!! We can now see through the claim of "Transparency".
@SenMikeLee ~I think he thinks he's a dictator!
@SenMikeLee I think it says that @SenMikeLee & @SenTedCruz were spot on to warn about this disaster.
@SenMikeLee incompetent goon. Wants to make laws then can't properly roll out or enforce them
“@SenMikeLee: What do you think of the president's secretive individual mandate delay? http://ow.ly/uzfNK  #Obamacare #MakeDCListen” NOT
@SenMikeLee I just wish you guys were on the floor and saying "I told you so" - just to be obnoxious
@SenMikeLee 

More deception, half truths, etc.
@SenMikeLee why is it surprising? Other than for the lefties who have there head buried in so far in the sand they can't see past there nose
@SenMikeLee Par for the course these days with the #ExecutiveOverreach from the #ImperialPresidency.
@SenMikeLee He is well aware when people start getting fined by the government it will spell major losses for Democrats. Try to delay pain
Par for the course? @SenMikeLee What do you think of the president's secretive individual mandate delay? http://ow.ly/uzfNK   #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee More disdain for the Laws of our Nation. He "had"to have it, and now he picks and chooses what is valid in the LAW?#DCvsAmerica
@SenMikeLee wishing he would disappear like that airplane...
@annem712 @SenMikeLee That's a good one :)
