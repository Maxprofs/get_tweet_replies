@SenMikeLee Utah gets more money from Government than Calif. You are Ted's flunky and you are ignorant.
@SenMikeLee RT this. Why worry, your reign is coming to an end. Let me be the first to say BYE and #shut the door behind you!
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber We appreciate all that u and Senator Cruz and Senator Paul r doing for this country.
@SenMikeLee @darab_ic I don't believe our immig. System is BROKEN. It's NEVER been ENFORCED! Why pass new laws that will also go UNENFORCED?
@ryteisryte That's exactly why it's broken :) I agree with you actually. Rule of Law applies before making new laws.
@darab_ic @SenMikeLee Until DC shows it will enforce the existing laws, to qoute The Who, we "Won't Get Fooled Again"!
@ryteisryte Yes & that msg > @SenMikeLee needs to give to the rest of the Senators. I know he will stand & speak truth to them.
@SenMikeLee Just wanted to let you know I appreciate everything you are doing and support you! God bless you! #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @eph4_15 You guys have so many fronts to defend.  Our prayers with you. I believe God wants us to have personal responsibility

@SenMikeLee If_You_Say_NO Assad will use chemical weapons again, and our children will continue to die #Say_yes_to_save_them
@SenMikeLee @JohnFromCranber Mistakes of the past?  Hmmm, can u say 1986 and California?
@SenMikeLee  Let me ask you Senators. Why is Obamacare good for me and not you? Did you do what Nancy said, read it after you passed it?
@SenMikeLee thank you for standing up for the rule of law and the American citizens.  #NoAmnesty #ObamaKillingAmerica
@senmikelee Great idea putting the speech in multiple tweets. I will re-tweet each one. God bless you Sir.

@SenMikeLee @NickEgoroff this is why I appreciate the piece meal action taken by #Congress to address #immigration. Not sweeping but focused

@SenMikeLee @KatyinIndy We need a lot more like you, Ted Cruz, and Jeff Sessions to stop this type of governance.
@SenMikeLee Sad 2 see the 1st Black POTUS bringing slavery back 2 US~import foreigners- work 4 low wages & do whatever the ruling class says
@SenMikeLee I applaud you for your efforts sir! The bill will die in the House. I look forward to the backlash on the 14 @GOP who voted yes!
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU! FOR DEFENDING OUR LIBERTY!!!
@SenMikeLee Senator, thanks for your opposition to this sham immigration reform bill in Senate that grants amnesty before border enforced.

@SenMikeLee --we want the existing LAWS enforced & border secured--4.7% unemployment in Mexico-here 4 freebees-#NOAMNESTY @DickDadamo
@SenMikeLee-why is amnesty being pushed-special interest control Rinos--untold millions of new Dem voters & welfare recipients  @DickDadamo
@SenMikeLee Re-tweeted! Thanks Sen. Lee. You are a true patriot.
@SenMikeLee Thank you Sen. Lee, this makes me sick to know my Sen. Jeff Flake voted yes on this horrible bill ...
@SenMikeLee Please gather all @Senate_GOPs to help strip bill of everything but border security,Follow on bills can prosecute the illegals.
.@SenMikeLee OK! Now you're talking Sir! :-)
@SenMikeLee It appears you and @SenTedCruz are the last men standing. RINOs are parasites who will give the nation away to the lowest commie
@Pedroamartinez @SCforfreedom @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Well said Pedro.
