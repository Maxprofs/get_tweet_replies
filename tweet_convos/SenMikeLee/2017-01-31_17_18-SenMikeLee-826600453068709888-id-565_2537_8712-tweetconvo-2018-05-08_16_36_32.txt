But do u think they might have read the books and be offnded? Don't want u on there rong side
Your treatment of Merrick Garland was shameful. And you stole President Obama's rightful nomination. GOP senators are thieves.

@tedcruz who is Senator Mike Lee? You are not the total committee and you are speaking something untrue.
Step one. Apologize to the American people for the SCOTUS seat you stole from them.

@texasfreedom101 BREAK UP THE 9TH CIRCUS
I pray you are able to push your liberals dressed as republicans along. .They are timid, weak and pathetic
@tedcruz Susan Collins is voting Devos down because of vouchers, choice, competition -Liberty monopoly she chooses
Oh, so unlike your breach of constitutional obligation to consider Garland, now you're "working"? Hypocrite. @mattdpearce
Go Thank the Biden Rule!
You mean the Biden Rule, that uh. Didn't actually block anyone back in 1992, and was just talk? Derp
Yup, words came back to hunt the Democratic Party . Sucks!
@tedcruz is just worried your Klan buddies will F him up a lil
 That's why he has a "help me" smile on Melania taught him that 
Every person in that pic has at least once said he was #NeverTrump .
@tvheidihatch get the lazy dems to end the pathetic boycotting of cabinet picks. Or maybe boycott their pay..
Well how about the eight years of the lazy GOP not bringing any legislation for job creation.
#whineylittlesnowflacks #smh #gofindyoursafespace #Tearsandtramafromnotgettingurway

#tortreform
@RichLowry We're too close to the mid-term elections. You must wait until the American people have spoken. Right?
No,that only allows plies to the Presidential election. Research.Learn&GrowUP. Be nice.
Why?
why be nice? RU dense?
why does it only apply to presidential elections?
What a bunch of tools. Such brown nosers. Get spines
Yes all part of your plan to dismantle the constitution ignoring my rights
Dont be afraid of the Nuclear Option if there is any undue stalling.
he needs to be SCOTUS in APRIL BC 6 key cases&must break tie!
. Get it done, Senator. @SenMikeLee @Jana_1977
No thanks! No Gorsuch.
@tedcruz  The CITIZENS of the USA will BE the Benifactor of Bringing back the True meaning of CONSTITUTION   AMEN and Thank GOD
@SenSasse @tedcruz Three of the most awesome senators!
@Catholic_Radio  Thank you sir.
Works for me!
Judge Gorsuch was easily approved once before.
Tons of good wishes coming your way and prayers for your continued success!!
I hope it happens quickly
when do you begin?
My top three favorites! God Bless you all!!
i suppose you can be redeemed as well.
@tedcruz @tedDo the thing!

YEEGO @SenMikeLee from Navajo land

@raiderman108 is going to be good for the American people see judges respecting the constitutional rights and Americans values
Gorsuch is a start and a promise kept. At the next opportunity, I'd like to see you nominated and confirmed as well.
go hold Al Franken on the steps of the Capitol while Ted Cruz punches him in the stomach
Gotta love the moral values of #Mormoms Kneeling at the #SEXUALPREDATORINCHIEF
2 bad the constitution didn' applied 2 the black president, there is 1 for R n antoher for the Dems, #shameful
yeah go to it!!!!
I hope he never gets a vote.  Serves you hypocrites right.
git it done!
Why will it take 6 weeks before the hearings begin? 2 weeks should be sufficient.
Hopefully not but then again you guys dont care what the people want
I have faith in the dream team. Go go 
I love that pick, go forth and conquer.
and how about h1b can we stop that? Hurting Americans getting jobs? There bring taken care of more then American
what about Scott Pruitt. Dem. Are holding this up also. Will this go to the Senate. ? And how about the others in cabinet.? Pass
didn't you disparage Trump before the election?
NOW you're ready to get to work? Aren't you a little late?
@senjudiciary  You have the support of conservative millions who will not stand for leftist carnival stunts during this process.
@tedcruz Hi guys! How is Sen Sessions confirmation coming along, and does anyone ever reply to tweets from us deplorables?
Look Curly, Larry and Moe. Glad you are enjoying the #TrumpTrain Now lets get to work and Make America Great Again! @POTUS
@JimWilemon Thank you, Sirs.

@tedcruz y'all are a bunch of chumps who follow trumps orders, next year your time is up!!!
#Deplorable tears won't save you!! 
Do some of you Republican Anti Trumpers still not approve of him and still trying to thwart his every move?
. Thank you!
Confirm Neil Gorsuch Now!  Great news!!
you were quoted by @washingtonpost
You would have been better IMHO.
sir let's quickly confirm this brilliant jurist. Hopefully you will be the next nominee for the next SCOTUS vacancy.
@sumarie711 get it done, he's the kind of Judge that's needed.
The three best.
Sub out cruz for Rand then you have the three best
Glad you guys are more worried about horrible selfie angles than you know, fixing your broken country.  Great tweet!

Git R Done! God bless you guys!
Do it!
#stolenseat
Great Job! Glad we have people in the white house that actually care about Godly morals and the American people!

@tedcruz Godspeed
Who's that sellout bum to the right of #BenSasse
Thank you!
PS please tell the nasty boycotters the American people want their pay refunded back 2 We The People & them REPLACED!
#Constitution Dream Team 
Too early: Cruz says "[W]e should not vote on any nominee until the next president is sworn into office."
@tedcruz Ben Sasse against Trump EO on terror nation travel!! He is a globalist!!
@PoppyPoppyb   Who is that constant obstructionist in the middle?
@tedcruz Now you're ready?    Traitorous Repuglicans sat idle for a year on Merrick.  Now you're ready?    Shameful.
Then with all due respect , don't allow the left one day of self indulgence , kill their idea of revenge , use nuclear option.
According to recent survey data, 2 out of 3 US Senators in this picture consider Gorsuch the 2nd best pick for the SC.
Please! No filibuster or fight! Dems loved him in 2006. Call them out on it!
How about you tell your lazy staffers to answer their phones.
@tedcruz Get the entire cabinet passed! President Trump is our voice & we love him. He is his word!
@SenSasse Glad You're on board for SCOTUS because you sure didn't help candidate TRUMP!!
Is your motto "Never Trumpers till we die"
really? Where were u 4 last nominee? Party over country-shame on you. NOW u want 2 do your job? Shame on u #VoterRights #Choice
@Bane1349 Pls touch SCOTUS, Scott Harris (personally) rejects 14A cases filed pro se against their state. Sec 7, Jud Act @POTUS
3 of the best
Good.. Watch out for these 2 idiots.
@GovtsTheProblem I would pre-announce the #NuclearOption date to be 3-4 weeks from today if the Dems continue to act out.
Make that 3 to 4 days.
There is no point in debate. 
The Democrats have chosen their path.
can you guys finally give the president credit?
Refused to vote on Merrick Garland for 293 days
hope it is nothing like our cabinet picks!! This is taking way to long @POTUS @vp
@ish10040 So now you NeverTrumps who risked our country and SCOTUS want to claim our victory. Lying RATs.WE don't forget.
I listened to Ted last night on Tucker, I was impressed. Stopped caring what Sasse said long ago...
I hope you get it done.
@tedcruz praying for you all.
'Git 'r done' sir!
Obstructing hypocrites #MerrickGarland deserved a hearing. #StolenSCOTUSseat is what Gorsuch will fill #weseeyou
why didn't you say this when Merrick B. Garland was nominated? These political games need to end. #resist #LoveArmy
Mr Lee...Please do it for us. I have had enough of the democratic blockade.
@qnoftherealm Mike I remember you saying you could not get behind Trump. glad to see you changed your mind. "we the people"
@tedcruz Why didn't you work for Merrick Garland and not obstruct for a year? Too immersed in hypocritical bullshit I guess.
Since when does the president get to chose the new justice?
I'm with you!
Go with God gentleman.   May The Spirit of Gods Holiness make your way for the glory of Jesus our King and God.  Amen
Tell all those who would try and stop him that the American people are tired of their dam games. Do their jobs.
Love this picture. My 3 favorite political crushes! Now crush the Dem BS!
@SenSasse @tedcruz @marcorubio @SenatorLankford @SenBobCorker @SenAlexander @SenatorTimScott tell us what u need 2 #geterdone
@CLewondowski_ hoping that you do your jobs and need be go nuclear. The country is counting on you!
Can you also get to work on the confirmation hearings so that President Trump can get started fixing things full force?
Thieves
@tedcruz Traitors . I'm ashamed of my country because of you.
all that's missing is their NeverTrump badges, exclusive fake conservative club cards and 3 pussyhats.
@tedcruz puppets on strings! #GarlandforSC
.@SenMikeLee Please gain the wisdom decidedly absent during election. @BenSasse 
Please never slander our president again.
.@SenMikeLee What would the American people do without the good judgement of Nevertrumps? 
(hint: we'd have Hillary's pick) @BenSasse
Hey thanks so much for your help in getting Trump, the only reason we have a possibility of a great judge, elected
in 12 months #karma
nope! Hope smart Americans vote you out next term!
DO YOUR JOB!! "Come on Man!"
That's great and all. BUT! Try confirming Trump's other Cabinets also dammit!!!!!!
I’d like to see you unemployed! Nothing personal.
#novoteforrelection
@tedcruz where were you in 2016? Oh sorry you were making crap up and calling it constitutional
@tedcruz That's a lotta legislative horsepower right there! #GitRDun!
Thank you!
@UghToHillary Use Nuclear option if you must. Get him in!
.@SenMikeLee @tedcruz Thrilled to hear that! Millennials at #TheMilReview thank you for all you do in the fight for freedom! #Gorsuchbae
@tedcruz @SenMikeLee Thank you Cruz!
Don't dick this up Mike.
@mattdpearce Too bad you weren't so eager to meet your Constitutional obligations under Obama. #GOPFail #GOPLies #ResistTrump
#novoteforrelection
@tedcruz Lunatics!
God Bless you Senator Lee
@tedcruz Make it so...
Outstanding, get it done.
Thank you Senator Lee
@tedcruz u both disgust me! This should b Garland; instead u r mincing & dicing 2 justify this pick who will screw women, LGBTQ
Godspeed
Three of my very very favorites! So glad you're in DC to represent us!!
Sure, right after you give a hearing to Garland like a decent person would.
I am happy with the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the U.S. Supreme Court. He is good for the nation. Fight for him.
If it were up to you Hillary would be nominating SCOTUS. 

TRAITORS to your own voters. Despicable. Unforgivable.
Please do not confirm Sessions!!

@BenSasse You're reaping the rewards from the victory you tried hard to prevent. You're welcome, signed #AlwaysTrumpDeplorable
Three #NeverTrumpers who want to bask in the glory of a DJT Supreme Court selection, yet wouldn't support Trump as nominee
Hey, it ain't all about YOU. Give us our Secretary of State and other top slots NOW!
go nuke if you have to!!
@tedcruz  Not.
The Three Stooges. #commies
@tedcruz He must be confirmed and sworn in before April
NICE! GREAT EMPLOYEES! THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE OF AMERICAN FREEDOM! LOVE FROM TEXAS! NOW GIVE THE DEMOCRATS SOME TEXAS HELL!
