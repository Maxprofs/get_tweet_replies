@SenMikeLee Dems have strapped the helm toward the iceberg ACA while the people on the Titanic are screaming to change direction.
@SenMikeLee STOP.  You're killing the Republican Party.
@tomHiawathaLake @SenMikeLee These poorly thoughtout tactics empower Dems, they don't stop them.Dems delighted by Lee shutting down govt.
@SenMikeLee @MushKat especially when we've borrowed 6 trillion in 5 years! Maybe we should pass everything individually...
@SenMikeLee @LynnD_P Correct! and my tax dollars should not go to pay for an Obama-PHONE !!!
@SenMikeLee @StevePerkins14 Most Americans feel the same, seems REID doesn't represent AMERICA?
@SenMikeLee @CCreiglow You don't have to.  The House Represents the American People, and the President is not a dictator.  Stand Strong!

@Ron_GriffithsJr Reid & Obama are engaging in dangerous posturing. Nothing unreasonable in our position.
@LindaSuhler I agree. We need to #HoldTheLine, #DontBlink & #DontCave. .@SenatorReid needs to pass & .@BarackObama needs to sign #House CRs.
@ladydonnalands @Ron_GriffithsJr @SenatorReid @BarackObama You got it darlin'. Crank it up--we're not budging.
@SenMikeLee @sleeepathon #Shutdown #MakeDCListen  We agree with you but (thankfully) we're not Democrats. We actually 'think!'
@SenMikeLee Says a guy who defaulted on his home loan.  Paying debts you owe is different than "funding everything."
@SenMikeLee @Bidenshairplugs you shouldn't be funding anything that isn't good for the American people.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing firm.
@SenMikeLee @whethervain1 if obama changed law 19 times doesnt it have to go back to supreme court?
@SenMikeLee Thank you for YOUR work!!

@SenMikeLee If your not doing whole job, you should be getting none of your salary! Or, not paid anything to just do some things. Simple eh?
@SenMikeLee Shutting down our government 2 please a minority is wrong. #Teaparty safe through gerrymandering, but you'll never gain WHouse

@SenMikeLee @ROCnewsletter senator Lee please keep reminding US its about $$ we don't have that we are stealing from our kids. Not just ACA.
@SenMikeLee #Shutdown #MakeDCListen we especially shouldn't fund your sorry ass.  Do your job and open the government
@rlkelley @SenMikeLee RL, CONGRESS holds the purse strings, not the pres. Once the pres compromises, then the govt will open again.
@SenMikeLee @sounds4freedom BOOM!! House of Reps people's house, where purse strings are held. Thank you for fighting.
@SenMikeLee please tell me you'll run for president.
@SenMikeLee Defund O'crap care!
@SenMikeLee  Is this serious or from the Onion? It's downright embarrassing to watch this. I can hear the terrorists laughing
@SenMikeLee good job at hurting business and jobs! #shutdown I look forward to voting against you!
@SenMikeLee Sen. Mike Lee, proud supporter of the Articles of Confederation (not so sure about that Constitution stuff...)
@SenMikeLee YOU don't have the power to determine how the entire government works. You will pay for your terrorism and radicalism.
@SenMikeLee @belvdere right you are Senator. #obama needs to start realizing it's not all going to happen his way.  Needs to negotiate.
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash Yes, you should. That's how it works. You will fund popular programs that you always voted to slash previously.
@SenMikeLee @Lrihendry Logic, common sense, and fiscal responsibility will get you no where. How dare you make such a fine and cogent point.
@SenMikeLee @justadad21 thank you senator for standing tall against the liberal left beast out to destroy our free society!

#confusion  @SenMikeLee
Can u remind Dems who think its fun calling Republicans terrorists, that us vets fought real ones #FundMyVA @SenMikeLee @repjustinamash
@SenMikeLee  Government shutdown progress stops moving forward and the Democrats solution is to throw out the anchor.
@SenMikeLee @pinecohen Harry the sexist Reid shut it down!!
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash So you'd pay your electricity bill but skip out on the gas bill? I don't think you understand how bills work...
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash Warning: If I have to choose between affordable health care and the Republican Party, guess which one will lose.
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash As a citizen I'm tired of "comprehensive" legislation.  Just used to hide waste and pork!
@SenMikeLee @repjustinamash You're holding the United States people hostage, which is tantamount to  treason. Shame on the GOP
@SenMikeLee  The end Game should be! Tell Dem's make obamacare if someone doesn't want it optional! Win / Win for both sides!
@SenMikeLee Show up @ your local Rep tomorrow 12pm http://www.teapartypatriots.org 
.@SenMikeLee @FredZeppelin12 Logical you are, as always.
@SenMikeLee tell that to the 800, 000 workers not getting paid. We can see right through you.
Yes you should. @SenMikeLee Democrats and POTUS aren't going to deal with terrorists.
@RepublicanRehab @TurnKyBlue @SenMikeLee Yes Everything Gets Funded Or Nothing!!!  Stop Holding This Country Hostage GOP = Terrorists
@SenMikeLee @Toupsfamily No Family Buys Everything To Get Some Groceries And Neither Should Government.
@SenMikeLee amen
@SenMikeLee you do not speak for the demographics of American anymore. Only people who fear like GOP Thug gang #hatesamericans
@SenMikeLee Hey Mike, You know what happened? You got bit in the ass by the kooks you coddled. Obamacare is here to stay. It's a success!
@SenMikeLee Yes Sir
@SenMikeLee We shouldn't have to fund bits & pieces to satisfy GOP. Tell Boehner to bring clean CR to floor for a vote.
@SenMikeLee Right... we should just fund what YOU want. Fascist.
@SenMikeLee U also shouldnt B paid through all this The only reason Y U R donating your checks is because U were forced not because U chose
@SenMikeLee Wow, u speak w/some serious intelligence 2 bad the senate commies hear only 'wah, wah, wah wah wah wah wah.'
@SenMikeLee your constituents shouldn't have to be furloughed so you can stomp your feet about a bill that was upheld by the Supreme Court
@SenMikeLee this could have been avoided if the senate would have just done their jobs and passed a budget
.@SenMikeLee GOP shutdown the govt bc they LISTENED to #WeThePpl. We don't want a Bad Policy big TAX. #MakeDCListen #GOPshutdown #shutdown
@SenMikeLee The more time passes with the "shut down" the pressure & hype will surmount. Use every moment 2 expose them & make em cave & run
@SenMikeLee Did u note Obama's inference today that those who voted 4 him would sign up for O-care FOR HIM? #dearleader
@SenMikeLee Don't stop, don't cop out, don't sell out the nation's people. Fear God whom this nation is under & look alone 2 Him 2 deliver u
@SenMikeLee  Thanj you and stay strong. You, Cruz and true conservatuves are heroes outside the beltway.
@SenMikeLee keep up the fight! Please for God and country don't back down! Tell Dem's make obamacare if someone doesn't want it optional!
@SenMikeLee  The Democrats are the modern day British from the Boston tea party.
@SenMikeLee words escape me. I can't tell if you really believe in what you're doing, or are just pot committed and see no way to save face?
Such as, you probably continued funding your car payment after you discontinued funding your mortgage payment.
#RepayThe400K 
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee This is the time 2 wake up Uncle Sam & get him off BHO's blood letting table. The Marxicrats aim is 2 finish him off & bury him
@SenMikeLee Quit your childish Tea Party temper tantrum and send a clean bill, including funding war memorials, to President Obama.
@SenMikeLee #Shutdown #MakeDCListen Good to hear the #teaparty is on "strike"!  Hold the line!
@SenMikeLee Repubs need to stand firm!!  The tide will turn.  Dems are boxed in. They HAVE to accept piecemeal funding.  Then we win!!
@SenMikeLee The Marxicrats can only spit out the same retread propaganda over & over. Powerfully call them out on their lies with clarity
@SenMikeLee Nicely said
@SenMikeLee Pass one bill at a time. Bundled bills full of wastefull spending/ pork is #1 reason why we are in this position
@SenMikeLee This country would be better off if we never again fund anything that doesn't fall under intended powers. #shutdown ok by us
@SenMikeLee AMEN! Stand ur ground, guys. UR fighting the good fight. If they dont come our way, up ante. Bal budget, spending cuts &NOBAMACA
@SenMikeLee Don't #shutdown everything. People are hurting. Right fight, wrong venue. Pass a #cleanCR and fight #Obamacare later.
@SenMikeLee #Shutdown Stand strong! When the opposition will negotiate, you will have an edge on them. Thank You!!
@SenMikeLee EXACTLY!
@SenMikeLee Dems are upset about cherry picking? ObamaCare ring any bells? Delay for all AFTER approved by Congress!
@SenMikeLee @LawMDF DO YOUR JOB.
@SenMikeLee I agree! behind you 100% #DemShutdown #MakeDCListen

@SenMikeLee ACA is NOT the law of the land. It has been illegally altered many times since it passed 3 years ago and SC ruled constitutional
@SenMikeLee The House has set the platform. You BOTH better get on it and start pounding away and exposing the Marxicrats' trojan death care
@SenMikeLee .. like needing only a gallon of milk but forced to buy the whole cow in the process.
Agree! RT.“@SenMikeLee: We shouldn't have to fund everything in order to fund anything: http://youtu.be/WUYb9PfedcY  #Shutdown #MakeDCListen”
@SenMikeLee Until they change the law so there are no Obamacare waivers including Congress. It's safer for everyone that it not be funded.
@SenMikeLee making congress eat the dog food is the first step in galvanizing their opposition to something we all know is crap the ACA
@SenMikeLee You are doing the right thing! Obama and Harry are proving they are more interested in protecting OCare than funding the govt.
@SenMikeLee The Supreme Court declared Obamacare a tax. A tax that the president can inflict on his enemies and waive for his friends.
@SenMikeLee Y'all are doing a fine job and we the people thank you. The #SenateMustAct to end #HarryReidsShutdown. The people won't give in!
@SenMikeLee what about the millions of ppl who need affordable health insurance. #Obamacare is law. Let's reopen the gov't & move fwd. #gop
@tomHiawathaLake @SenMikeLee Private companies are doing it. Check the exchanges. It's privatized.
@SenMikeLee equal treatment under the law. Hammer that all day. Eventually that will reach the populous. It's an un-defendable position.
@SenMikeLee Keep up the good work....we're behind you.
@SenMikeLee IMPEACH !
@SenMikeLee please continue to stand Tall and Strong against this tyranny!!!! We The People are behind you!
@SenMikeLee YES that is the FAIR WAY to do the Funding, Fund EVERYTHING.  However you are not Fair.
@SenMikeLee No, you shouldn't.  But ur dealing w ppl who think they're never going 2 lose another election.
@SenMikeLee Do not break, Americans are behind you, the state run media is a joke and few pay attention to it. #DefundObamacare
@SenMikeLee Look at the incompetence in #DC. Why would we give CONTROL of our #HealthCare to this dysfunctional #Leviathan? #DontBlink
@SenMikeLee Amen! Keep up the good work!
