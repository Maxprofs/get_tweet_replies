Why can't Trump admit that Russia interfered in the U.S. election.  Not a "hoax" - ia national security threat

As Jon Huntsman said
Jon you should have had the courage to run for President. Instead you're serving as Trump's lackey why?
R u qualified enuf to put Americans over corporations?  NO on Trumpcare3.0
@SenSasse @BenSasse @SenatorFischer @SenJohnMcCain THIS is how you should legislate...for ppl, NOT 4 Koch checks!  Vote NO on trumpcare 3.0 https://twitter.com/funder/status/910604482043678721 …
How about #healthcare ? Please vote (((NO))) on #GrahamCassidyBill !!! #Medicaid #Disability

Love the tears
Your staffers hang up on constituents when they phone your office to express their opinions, Mike.  Maybe you train them to talk to people.
Are you guys planning on confirming any more judicial nominees, or waiting til Leap Year?
They are slow walking it
Why is your office hanging up on people expressing their displeasure with #GrahamCassidy? Why do you want Americans to die?
Fine, Senator. Now we need a "no" vote on Graham-Cassidy. It is a travesty.
Horrid bill
Will you vote for #GrahamCassidy without full hearing schedule and CBO rating?
Of course he will Nicole, the Republicans don't care how many people are throwing off healthcare. We have universal healthcare.
When someone is admitted to the hospital without insurance they are not turned away. The taxpayers in that state bear the brunt. Not smart!
Or if taxpayers don't pay the hospital has to eat the cost of care. How many people want their local hospitals to go bankrupt?
But he was appointed by Trump....I thought u nevertrumpers hated Trump!
But do we really need an ambassador? I mean Ivanka has sat in Putin's chair & trump camp has so many personal ties. I don't see the need.
Why wld u risk the lives of Moms & babies w #GrahamCassidy ?
Risking Mormon #LDS Utah lives 
Shame on you!
Vote No for 
Huntsman is a stealth democrat
#SaveACA #ProtectOurCare #NORepeal. Think of all your constituents who will be adversely affected by Graham Cassidy bill. Vote NO!
I hear your staffers are hanging up on constituents expressing their opinions.
At least Mr.Huntsman understands the seriousness of Russian meddling in our elections!!!
You have the rudest staff I have ever talked to. Day good by #GOPGONEBY2018
Cancer patients will face a nightmare scenario if Trumpcare becomes law. Don't let Kids Die! Vote No on GOP Health Care
We can
Do we have a U.S. ambassador to France? Seems like we could use a bilingual level-headed representative to help r rocky relation w/key ally
I like Huntsman and I'll try and not hold it against him that he didn't fire you if he was your boss. You Mr. Lee are a joke.
Will be a great day in Utah when Mike Lee is voted out.

Put up somebody a bit better than Misty next time.

Huntsman says Russia influenced the election. What say you Short Sale?
Throw up Mike Lee. U sure have a lot of friends & former bosses. Too bad your constituents don't feel the same about you!
Really????
Get rid of Lee, also !
Huntsman is an old swamp dweller
As a HUMAN You can't vote for #GrahamCassidy crime I know you can't cuz you are a real man not a criminal God bless
Finally something Mike Lee is correct about. Maybe there is hope......
He was mission companion of my husband when they served in Taiwan in the late 70's.  He's a good man.
Think he's right....
Not really a fan, but okay.
As long as he's got CIA credentials we're good.
You're a HACK Sen. Lee
Our current Congress is pathetic & worthless.
How can you look us in the face & claim you represent UT? #NoIncumbants
Damn! We agree on something!!!
Yes the huntsman is a good man. Great family he's great positive figure for the  Trump nation good man to watch over our friend in Russia
Didn't you say he was a traitor for serving as Obama's ambassador to China,hypocrite
Too bad you haven't tweeted about POTUS's FABULOUS speech. Guess it hurts.
How much do you want to bet the "Russia collusion" crowd will try and say John Huntsman Jr. colluded, is racist.....?
Hopefully he is not as anti-Trump as you and follows the will on the citizens of Utah.  REPEAL OBAMACARE, that's why we put you into office.

Vouching for your boss???
I've always enjoyed listening to his words and thoughts.
Should of been president
GOD BLESS YOU, SENATOR MIKE LEE, FOR ALL YOU DO!  I'M SO PROUD, KNOWING YOU ARE IN THE U.S. SENATE -- and I don't even live in Utah.
Another Crook?
You're a deplorable.
I can
Why would anyone accept anything that comes out of the mouth of a GOP senator. They have lied to the Amer. public about everything for years
I'd rather have Huntsman in the Oval Office.
No
Huntsman is actually ethical and sane, two reasons the @GOP abandoned him years ago
Mikey you and your Treasonous buddies are finished in 2018, the slime from septic tank will be cleaned and you are part of it
Please do not vote for Graham Grassley bill. It will bankrupt Americans w pre existing conditions
That's not a bug, it's a feature.  @SenMikeLee hates people.
I bet Tillerson's pissed if he didn't get *that* job instead
*pissed off I mean. I'm crap at typing on iPad.
Pissed on..?
Huntsman is to good of a man to work for this administration. He will permanently ruin his reputation! @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC @HuntsmanAbby
I like Jon, but sorry to see him involved with anything to do with Trump!
Joey looks like president trump WAS wiretapped. When are you and mika poo going to apologize. President trump is always right. #MAGA
saw it too, but there's a really strong community beneath all that.

Our @will_c_fischer says #GrahamCassidy is just #TrumpCare with a new name and still takes health care away from thousands of #veterans. 
His Wikipedia bio doesn't even mention Russia outside this appointment. Shouldn't an ambassador speak the language and know the country?
I can, my Labrador
You should try being as reasonable as Jon Huntsman, Mikey.
Oh dear God! Really? Why not? He loves Russia like TRUMPUTIN does!
bet you voted for BHO too!
GOP has to cut OBAMACARE to give HUGE TAX CUTS to wealthy...we get $300 and get to wash their limos http://a.msn.com/01/en-us/BBEiIdb?ocid=st … … …
Manafort seems pretty qualified
Huntsman would have been a great POTUS.
I "m a Liberal and if a Republican had to win,this would have been the man!
Thank you Mike 
A great American - a great ambassador
