Our founding fathers did not compromise with Britain I do expect you to compromise on socialized healthcare. #fullrepeal #unitedforfreedom
Abe: Do or don't?
Don't #cruel #CharlieGard   https://www.facebook.com/abe.martin.9/posts/10213768746122670 …
Support the Cruz amendment! UnitedforFreedom
So you voted against sanctions? Now you're in bed with Jr. and Big Shot Kushner. Well you just lost in'18. Good riddance, traitor!
Gosh, it's almost like the American people prefer healthcare for the poor to tax cuts for billionaires
Fuck Cruz
Why is a Putin appointee in the White House?
NO trumpcare or Obamacare! #Cruz Amendment! #UnitedforFreedom!
Nearly 200,000 in Utah will lose insurance under your plan. Little worried about your part in self governance. #SavetheACA
Cruz doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground
#FullRepeal. No Trumpcare or Obamacare. At the very least go with #CruzAmendment. #UnitedForFreedom.
For repeel no replacement united for freedom
Honored? You are unpatriotic at best to continue to support a corrupt president and now trying to take healthcare away from all of us.

Self government? LOL! God, are you full of it, or what?
What do you expect from Utah 
How's your insurance buckwheat?
Why don't you serve them by stopping this lunatic action by dt.
Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded..
We are honored to have atleast one Senator working for Utah. ;-)

France, Germany, UK & Holland all ditched voting machines for hand  counted paper ballots. Canada uses them too - never had machines
you are not of Texas senators I would trade john cornyn any day of the week,please keep up the principled stand you have taken
#faketownhalls Lee just screens all the calls so they reflect what he wants. #utpol Face the music Mike!
While moving forward, actually move forward. Don't just thrash about. Get an AHCA version, tax relief, immigration controlled, laws abided.
Please vote NO on the AHCA.
Self government yes. Keep Trump away from Utah, with him in office, I'm feeling the (R) belief of resistance towards federal officials.
obama making parts of Utah federal monuments is okay with you, clearly you are not affected my it
Blah, blah, blah.  Why do you continue to suck up to the lying, narcissistic POTUS when you must know better?  Shame on you.
Shrink gov..otherwise wasted! Shrink all spending..& power! Please. God bless!
Senator Lee, you are serving more than just the people of Utah. Thank you.

Happy Idependance Day to you!! Senator!!
Self-governance requires a willingness to invest in the government and its people, a concept that Republicans can't grasp.
Please say Happy Independence Day!!!
You ignore your constituents and vote in the worst interest of Utahns. I haven't been more disappointed in Utah government.
Cool, cool. Let's talk about keeping it exceptional by helping the country stay alive. Vote no on AHCA, Senator. It's the Utah way.
Then hold POTUS accountable. He is not our  ruler. Stand strong.
Mike.  I'm in Brazil til Friday.  Each day I'm so thankful I am an American & US Citizen.  Like big Gov't?  Come to Brazil
Mike,  I just wished you represented VA.  We have bozo-1 and bozo-2 (or is it Thing-1 and Thing-2).  Keep fighting. Sorry to lose Jason
Self government means take away r healthcare, sell R privacy rights, kill R bear/wolf pups in their dens along with selling bears ears.
I don't call it service, when you are trying to take healthcare away from Utah's vulnerable, and destroying our national parks.
Boy-I sure wish you actually served us utahns rather than your high dollar special interests and religious/party-line views!!!! 
If only that were True!  Larry Kudlow & Guest on his most recent Radio Show; concluded that, Congress & the Presidency have lost, - - more -
. . . have lost the Consent of Governed.  American People have lost faith in both Institutions; thus, T/System - NOT Working for the Masses.
My view; nothing wrong with,The System! The Problem exists because immoral, selfish, &  greedy People are getting elected W/lies & Dark $$$
What?
Remember 2018 is coming and is not funny. Start, you all Republicans working with the President.
Please try harder to REPRESENT the people of Utah, rather than "serving" us with your fringe-right views. 
Listen to us.
No kidding.
Bipartisan Senate!!!!!!! And, please think about actual people when you craft a healthcare bill. Don't take our healthcare away!!!!!
Represent UTAH! Be sure to care what America wants. No my way highway. Make a deal good for America. Give in a little. Work 2gether.
Get health care and tax reform done.
It's "Independence Day" not Happy 4th.  We don't say Merry Dec. 25th we say Merry Christmas.  You should know better. @LouDobbs
No, it's politicians serving the wealthy donors via legal bribery. 
America needs a Free and Fair Elections amendment.
Honestly, I find you worthless. Remember when you said  "women use birth control to protect themselves from "𝑹𝒆𝒄𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒂𝒍 𝑩𝒆𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒊𝒐𝒓"?   84790
God Bless @SenMikeLee. You are one of the few in office who have principles.It's because of honorable men like yourself that we have freedom
Government should provide for the common defense and general welfare; put America's Health first over ideology and politics. #Trumpcarekills
What facts or evidence exist to prove that the Constitution and Statutes APPLY to anyone at all?
Thanks for serving and please get the best healthcare bill you can accomplish and pass in the Senate-no bill, no repeal!
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
Maybe you should answer your phones so you could know what your constituents actually want
Tell it like it is...  #Fearless
Strengthen your resolve to screw the poor.  Take away their healthcare so you can shower the rich with tax cuts they don't need.
Last line of Declaration of Independence is about dependence
"We ... pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor."
Independence day honors modern day Patriots like you. God Bless Sen. Lee!
Thank you for your service and support of our troops!
Those of us that love America can't wait for you to be unemployed.
Those of us who REALLY love America can't wait for idiots like you to leave!!  No one is forcing you to stay here!
Represent Utah and tell Trump to stop his idiotic tweeting.
Represent America and impeach a corrupt illegitimate president.
Did you do anything to keep @gordonhayward in Utah? No? Maybe we should impeach you.
bless you sir for holding the line on healthcare, have a wonderful safe Independence day
Thank You Senator, God Bless you and your family Patriot
#stayward
Repeal Obamacare.
Why?
as we are watching the destruction of it by partisan politics and corporate greed
you don't speak for me, you have been a failure in representing my values.
/as your party sabotages our experiment in self-government.
