@jraykitty @linksteroh @SenMikeLee @hillplus @cole_cole38 R y'all serious? Don't believe the Fox hype. Clearly not looking at facts
@jraykitty @linksteroh @SenMikeLee @hillplus @cole_cole38 it's the #gop controlled House that's done nothing in 5 years
@BigDCSW @jraykitty @linksteroh @SenMikeLee @cole_cole38 Um, no. Dems controlled both house and senate when BO took office. Do nothing, true
@hillplus @BigDCSW @jraykitty @SenMikeLee @cole_cole38: Yes, and from the day he was elected the GOP has vowed to obstruct his Presidency.
@linksteroh @BigDCSW @jraykitty @SenMikeLee @cole_cole38 Bad policy will do that to a president. His policies have been horrific
@hillplus @linksteroh @jraykitty @SenMikeLee @cole_cole38 bad policy or bad policy makers trying to make him into a bad man? #GOPLies
@BigDCSW @linksteroh @jraykitty  @cole_cole38 Now, you are not trying to play the race card, here,are you? It's overdrawn and will be DENIED
@SenMikeLee While you're #shooting your mouth off, here is what the rest of the #AmericanPeople have on their minds
@Terypat Terypat did you miss the by force part? @SenMikeLee
@NeoConAtheist I really have no idea what your point is, but I will say my #October tweet got a ton of hits!
@Terypat My point was to be guilty they would've had to use force to oppose Obama & they didn't.  Didn't you read your own post?
@SenMikeLee #VVS13 "It is time for a new approach to education, to break up the special-interest cartels that hold back our young children"
@SenMikeLee #GOP #Tcot you made History Again! ALL-TIME LOWS  In Favorability: #GOP = 24% / #TCOT #Teaparty = 21%. Crtsy: NBC/WSJ poll #P2

@joshduggar after reading your tweets, I'm sorry to say my family will no longer watch your TLC show. There is no value in extremism.

@SenMikeLee To Dumb Republicans - "You don’t get to force a government shutdown, then complain about the ramifications of that shutdown."
