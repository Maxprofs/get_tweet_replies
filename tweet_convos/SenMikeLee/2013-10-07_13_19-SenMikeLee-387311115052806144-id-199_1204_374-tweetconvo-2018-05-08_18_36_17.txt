@papicek @SenMikeLee come on Brett your better than that #dissapointed
@TH3R34LTRUTH Piss on that noise. @SenMikeLee is a lying sack of shit and I've been seeing that in my TL for days now.
@papicek just so I'll know what is he lying about and why do you like ACA so much
@TH3R34LTRUTH The telcom companies got huge tax breaks (we all paid for) to buiild broadband, btw. Lots of places are still waiting for it.
@papicek I don't believe anyone should have anything give to them except truly disabled but way to much fraud there
@TH3R34LTRUTH You get just as much fraud in the private sector and most people woud love to work. 94% in an old study I saw.
@papicek 18 an hour  he is 22 with no college every tine they said no to raise he said fine I'll leave so they said no don't here's a raise
@mooretommyh @SenMikeLee Probably don't have the votes.
@mooretommyh @SenMikeLee I just remember Clinton. Impeaching him really didn't accomplish much because of the Senate. #SameSituation
@mooretommyh @SenMikeLee Yeah it did but I'm just not sure it accomplished much.  It's a shame the Senate didn't do anything.
@SenMikeLee @toni_toniham You have friends in the house time to get them to #ImpeachObama

PETULANCE is not PRESIDENTIAL.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Your reasoning is laughable.
Thank you for your voice and for your backbone---------->>@SenMikeLee @trucker4america #NoObamaFear
@SenMikeLee Exactly right, Senator. Petty and vindictive is no way for a president to go through life.
@SenMikeLee Thank you Sen. Lee for courageous leadership! Millions of us are behind you.

@SenMikeLee 

Full Speed Ahead Senator!!!
True patriots are not fully recognized from the beginning.   Especially by the uninformed!!!
@SenMikeLee @itsweezie So you think just because there were computer issues that are being fixed,people shouldn't have healthcare?
#Liar
@SenMikeLee @gnudarwin - like @Romneycare in MA - same program.  After 10+ years, 98% participation. I call that SUCCESS. Your program = DIE
@itsweezie You may be putting these gentlemen in the difficult position of supporting Romney ;-). @SenMikeLee @RomneyCare

@SenMikeLee U were onto something regarding SCOTUS declaring it a tax NOT fineand Congress didn't intend or author that tax.
@SenMikeLee @tntDVM Behold the misery Obama is dishing out now, can you hardly wait until Obama Care is implemented?
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Yes, absolutely!

Stand fast, Mike. :) @SenMikeLee @FedUpJoe
@SenMikeLee @PKLady22 Don't listen to all these Libtard's Mr. Lee, they have been drinking the Kool Aid to long and are stupid drunk on it.
@SenMikeLee @AndyWHumphreys don't think glitches r real, they don't want actual costs getting "out there".
@soccbballmom @SenMikeLee Maureen, I don't want to be rude, but you look exactly like Sen Cruz!!
@AndyWHumphreys @SenMikeLee lol, was showing support
.@SenMikeLee True! His acts show he despises citizens & is vindictive. Y would we want this gov't knowing r personal stuff & deciding HC?
@SenMikeLee @craigfinch1   You can say that again. Everyday Obama makes a fool out of himself with his comments & lies. WORST POTUS EVER!!!!
@SenMikeLee You're a peach Mike, along with your buddy-in-arms Ted Cruz. #Koch boys have you by the balls, huh. Stop lying and try honesty.
@SenMikeLee @PJStrikeForce  Did U see the director refuse to answer HOW MANY signed up?
A bureaucratic slime pit..Marxist/takeover/scheme.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Proof Of The Dictatorial, Tyrannical, Conniving, Colluding EXTORTIONIST Known As Barack Insane Obama.
@SenMikeLee @BunnysDaughter Certainly can't fault your logic!
@SenMikeLee r  Obamacare: Irresponsible, spiteful, wasteful, incomprehensible
@SenMikeLee You are right! Keep at it. This is #HarryReidsShutdown #StandWithTed #StandWithMike
@SenMikeLee @SteveSteveolson If Obama's IRS would target conservatives, why wouldn't it use their access to health care as a weapon? Fight!
@SenMikeLee @Jim_Peoples_  Thank you and @SenTedCruz for trying to save us from the Obamanation!
.@SenMikeLee @Jim_Peoples_ 
You are absolutely right !!!
Stay the couse Sen. Lee. 
Do not give in to the socialists
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee Govt big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have

@SenMikeLee hey Mike, #ObamaCare helped me lower my Insurance costs. I think it's here to stay buddy. #ACA
@ualdrivr @SenMikeLee  As long as I am willing to pay for it....
@SenMikeLee #Obamacaregoawaynoe
@SenMikeLee you're nothing but a stinking anarchist!!
@SenMikeLee You know as well as I that @speakerboehner is a drunk, a coward, and a liar. @cspanwj
@SenMikeLee: Boehner's behavior during week 1 of #shutdown has been the best argument FOR #Obamacare. @cspanwj
@SenMikeLee @iResistAll did O forget everything he said when he was a Sen for 124 days?
@SenMikeLee @joyreaper Obama administration behavior during Week 1 of #shutdown is justification for Republicans standing strong in Week 1!
@SenMikeLee @ashleythorel *best argument against Obama
@SenMikeLee  The 4 previous tweets capsulized all of my thoughts. Thanks!
@SenMikeLee @RealRepublican SHUT DOWN. Stand strong, stay down! Nation debt or Obamacare...that's O's choices!
@SenMikeLee @RealRepublican how about Congress NEVER approved the bill to repeal the entire bill?!
@thralltaken @SenMikeLee Defund it, repeal, just get rid of the unconstitutional piece of garbage.
@SenMikeLee @Conservative_VW Mike Lee press release ... Great overview
@SenMikeLee @LibertysArmyJr   Indeed!  It's Obama's way or the highway.  He knows Obamacare will bankrupt Americans & that's what he planned
@SenTedCruz @SenMikeLee http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/19-times-democrats-tried-to-negotiate-with-republicans-20131007 …

Seems to be a perspective than the Tea Party spin. Not much time left for you in Congress.
@SenMikeLee help! Our HC went from 570.00 a month to 1040.00 a month! Family of five making 32,000 last year.
@SenMikeLee @willstauff What is happening is not very smart of the DEMs.
@SenMikeLee @SnakebiteJones TRUTH!! Cannot sign up knowing govt not above punitive. Counter intuitive when unsecure as well. Defies logic.
@rbostick12 All this data mining & storing has to bother young Obama voters. Many are intelligent; just naive & idealistic.
@SnakebiteJones Truth. They are very savvy. Tech wise. Idealistic and inexperienced but not dumb.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  I hope you buy private insurance and do not get government health benefits that are payed for by taxes.Hypocrite!
@SenMikeLee Now that you’re winning, you need to declare what you want. I say voter ID for 1 year delay at a minimum
@SenMikeLee @angelamcknight9 Does anyone really want these petulant bullies in charge of healthcare?
@SenMikeLee I don't understand how the president's behavior this week refutes #Obamacare. #tuquoque fallacy.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz AMEN! Please stop the Dictator-in-Chief!
@SenMikeLee I would say impeachable when a President purposely targets Americans. In fact I would say the rule of law is along w/Constition
@SenMikeLee Excuse me? I think he's behaved pretty well, just expecting congress to DO IT'S JOB AND FUND THE GOVERNMENT.
@SenMikeLee
A govt so petty, spiteful & cruel
As 2 kick out 90yr olds & shutting down Amber Alert
WONT HESITATE
2 shut down YOUR HEALTHCARE!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Good!!!!   I Don't Want Obamacare!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz & Your Doing????
@SenMikeLee Obama's behavior has provided some very good justification for IMPEACHMENT & REMOVAL from office, truth be told.
@SenMikeLee @MoralsToFreedom derp derp derp
@SenMikeLee You mean @Presidentstompyfeet?
@SenMikeLee u need to get in line at the unemployment office come nov . hope those lobbies paid you well you are not an american
@SenMikeLee Obama has behaved like a  spoiled child. He should really grow up
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Speaking of behavior, any upcoming lunches with the caucus planned? You and Ted seem real popular there.
@SenMikeLee
Can you people not see that the ACA is failing yet you continue with your brainless defund agenda..#outrageous
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz If the government controlled health care Obama could hospitals and doctor offices like he has parks and monuments.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Don't back down.Tide is turning as more Americans learn they are losing health plans and new ones cost twice as much
MT @SenMikeLee: Obama’s behavior during week 1 of #shutdown is the best argument against #Obamacare anyone has made: http://ow.ly/pAjzt 
@SenMikeLee Defund Obamacare, this is the Democrats All Our Way. Or Nothings Fault. Everyone crying is exempt anyway, everyone suffers now.
@SenMikeLee Stand strong.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz....so true!! Now if his voters would/could understand that
@SenMikeLee God bless you and Senator Cruz! Thank you Senator Lee. Please stay strong and fight the good fight!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz The voter is getting their ins. wake up calls in the mail...Not pretty for Dems
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz YES.  It makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR.  RR said about gov't big enough to take everything away.  BINGO.  BHO 2013. Busted.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz .... Mike Lee is the best possible reason for free contraception there ever was.
@SenMikeLee You r delusional if you truly believe that. Rs holding budget hostage to defunded #ACA disgusting. Do it legally! #govshutdown
@SenMikeLee Your behavior during the first week of the #GovernmentShutdown is the best argument against voting for you.  #EndTheShutdownNow
@SenMikeLee There is a reason why all if DC is exempt from this disaster. Ocare is nothing but a scam. The dems need to eat this one
@senmikelee @sentedcru 14,775 and counting are people in KY signing up for much needed ACA in state! Thanks to their gov not their senators!
@SenMikeLee Exactly how does a President, who cannot legislate, shut down a goverment? What procedure do you claim he used?
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Hurting the entire USA to extract concessions from the President is unpatriotic and immoral.
@SenMikeLee @jrstws One wonders what will make democrats happy-all of nation be Detroit??
@SenMikeLee You risk our country for right wing propaganda! You will lose.  Stand firm Obams!
@SenMikeLee then let it fail if you're so sure it will? See Ronald Reagan on medicare before its passage, here: http://crywolfproject.org/taxonomy/term/75/quotes?page=1 …
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 
You both are sick
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 
Really Mike..........is that true......... who's paying you?
Big pharma, Big Oil
@SenMikeLee You are so right! Stand strong, Obamacare violates the 3rd, 4rth, 5th, 9th and 10th Amendments of the Bill of Rights.
@SenMikeLee However, their complete disregard for our constitutional rights and the violation of said rights are enough.#DefundObamaCare
.@SenMikeLee #DontBlink Public starting to realize #SpiteHouse petty antics to inflict pain from #HarryReidsShutdown
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz AMEN to that -- it's AMAZING, you'de  think they'd be touting the sheer number of signups -- no Obamaphones left???

@SenMikeLee you guys need to say in every media interview "Do you want the govt shutting down memorials needlessly in charge of your health"
@SenMikeLee Out of touch. http://wapo.st/1gkJ9A7  @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Obama is hurting America! Why are people being kicked out of their homes?
Here is what I did!
@SenMikeLee  and a good argument for Impeachment that needs to come soon or Senate and Congress will have no power. He's going to take it.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz REOPEN GOV'T. SEND FED EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK. WHO'S GOING TO PAY OUR CREDITORS? WHO'S GONNA FIELD THE HOUSE CALLS.
@SenMikeLee Yes, because #Obamacare ,#IRS and #NSA are a lethal combination that it is now obvious he will use.
@SenMikeLee No worries....No one can login to even sign up anyway...
How much money was spent on the site that does not let you sign up!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Mellow out Mike! It's not like he was hoggin' the Glory Hole @ the Airport or some other inconvenience 4 the GOP!

@SenMikeLee Isn't that the truth. It doesn't even matter who's "responsible", do you want ANYONE to have that power over your healthcare?
@SenMikeLee  The president is being bendictive to the American people
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz If Obamacare is so wonderful, why aren’t the Dems using that term?
@SenMikeLee Tea Party couldn't be MORE out of touch with what Americans want... @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee YES, total control of the people of this country!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz SEN LEE MUST HAVE NOT YET WOKEN UP FROM HIS SLUMBER OF STUPIDITY     SIR, OBAMAN WON HIS REELECTION  & ROMNEY LOST
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz   Still no fences or gates at the border though. #SpiteHouse
@SenMikeLee these bureaucrats will control our healthcare too.  What could possible go wrong?  Thank you Mike Lee!
@SenMikeLee Senator, you should attempt to change the law through the ballot box. Can't? Why do you think that is?
@SenMikeLee And the fact they can't even run a website.
@SenMikeLee Because he won't lay down and let you walk all over him? Really? @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Hey Mike, eliminate the Dept of Education, and reenact Glass-Steagall.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz and I thought the best argument against it was Death Panels?  Did that change?
@SenMikeLee Wiki: "petulant", see "Obama".
@SenMikeLee Really? Demeanor = argument against settled law? Earth calling Senator Lee.
@SenMikeLee you are an idiot
@SenMikeLee To quote Death, "Damn Right"!
@SenMikeLee Well said! We stand with you Sen. Lee! #MakeDCListen #HarryReidsShutdown
