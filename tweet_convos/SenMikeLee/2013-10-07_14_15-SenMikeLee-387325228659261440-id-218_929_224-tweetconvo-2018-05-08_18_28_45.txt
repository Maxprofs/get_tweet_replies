@SenMikeLee When will you start calling for impeachment Mr. Lee?
@bradcooney1 Impeach a president for disagreeing? What next? Impeaching for the color of his tie?
@sunoxen No, impeach him for violating the constitution on several fronts. Disagreeing? Jeez, I wish it were that simple.
@bradcooney1 What's your case?
@sunoxen and either you aren't American or been hiding your head in the sand!! @bradcooney1
@Atruetexan I'm an American and a Packers fan, moron. But don't agree that Obama should be impeached.
@sunoxen You are right what you called me...he should be arrested!
@Atruetexan Who would arrest him? He is Commander in Chief. Please explain.
@SenMikeLee Then congress must get in his way and stop his power grabbing @Pudingtane
@SenMikeLee   obama is disrroying we the people  too!! I want u to hear my fight for life story!!!
@SenMikeLee @BUcrimlaw Someone in Congress should stop this nonsense. The ACA was a mistake. How can a tax bill originate in Senate?
@reeltexas @SenMikeLee a tax bill CAN'T but don't let a little thing like the constitution get in Obama's way
@BUcrimlaw @SenMikeLee well what is the use of having laws and Constitutional parameters if nobody follows them??
@reeltexas @SenMikeLee I agree. For this administration-they either follow them or ignore them based on which furthers their cause.
@BUcrimlaw @SenMikeLee I don't get it. There must be something that Congress can do to stop all this.
@reeltexas @SenMikeLee you would think so since its blatant as hell. I went to law school too-it's unlawful. It perplexes me.
@SenMikeLee @willstauff More importantly we'll see how determined GOP is to stop expansion of govt & if they'll use their power to stop it.
@VoteEmAllOut @SenMikeLee @willstauff There are progressives in both parties. Peter King, Dick Army, McCain, Lindsey Graham, Cornyn & others
.@carolinalisa let's cut the bullshit and call "moderates" for what it is it's called, VOTING WITH DEMOCRATS!!! @LoriPatriot @VoteEmAllOut

@SenMikeLee @onewhitetiger Absolutely! This imposter in chief or Gangster in charge which ever you prefer is absolutely out of his mind!
@SenMikeLee @GOPBunny Exposed! But now will @GOP hold together with one argument? Or will the blink? This is more important than #Obamacare
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin He is a dictator, along with the congressmen refusing to represent us. Obama is scum of the earth in my book!!!
@SenMikeLee @Scrltt64   Do you have any indication that Obama has a Muslim agenda for America?  Please answer. I know you're busy but please
@SenMikeLee @HarrietBaldwin No surprise.  So what are we going to do about it?
@SenMikeLee Hopefully America is waking up to what #PresidentStompyFoot is doing> #ClowardPiven.  Google it #LowInformation types.

@SenMikeLee reps need 2 have sen and house members working 24/7 to find millions n waste & show Pelosi cupboards arent bare;  it's there
.@SenMikeLee We now see how determined the president is 2expand power of Fed Gov't & use that power 2harm the country to get what he wants
