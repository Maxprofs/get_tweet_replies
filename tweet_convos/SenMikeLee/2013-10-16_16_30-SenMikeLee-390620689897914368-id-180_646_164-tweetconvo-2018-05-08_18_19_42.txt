@SenMikeLee I'm ready to just cry at what these men & women are doing to my children's futures!
#ObamasWarOnAmerica & #ObamacareFail #tcot
@SenMikeLee I identify w/ @lisamichelle20 w/small children even tho mine are grown, My daughter in her 20's has BA w/retail job to survive.
@ChasD3 @SenMikeLee Thanks Charles, had 2 change channel when Obama began to gloat on TV just now, even hearing his voice makes me sick now!
@lisamichelle20 Dear Lisa, Lk u I hv been changing the channel as fast as my fingers can operate a remote when he appears. He nauseates me!
@ChasD3 What's really sad is those who accuse me of being racist because I disagree with Obama!
I only care about merit!
O bullies & lies!
@SenMikeLee Senator Lee, a sincere thank you for your courage and action.  May God continue to bless you and your efforts to save the USA.
@SenMikeLee @LilSouthernSass another chance when funding ENDS mid-Jan WITHOUT IMMINENT Debt Limit issue-3-4 weeks to squeeze AGAIN&CAMPAIGN!
@SenMikeLee how does #obamacare not violate article 1 section 7 clause 1?
@ahuntre Since U were TOO LAZY & to get off your ASS & VOTE, I think @SenMikeLee is far less of a tool than you!
@SenMikeLee Isn't extortion, blackmail & bribery against the law. Why can Obama get away with all his criminal activity & NO one stops him
@SenMikeLee Thanks for the fight Mike don't give up we just have to be smarter oh and throw McCain under the bus like he has you and Ted
.@SenMikeLee It's how they do things now. With Gangs of X and special committees, you are just supposed to sign the X w/o questions @vmpcott
@infocyde @SenMikeLee @vmpcott Proxy politicians.
@coastx Probably. But until they break their roles I'll tentatively have hope in 'em. It won't be too long till they do most likely.
@infocyde We have honor. THEY have the child sacrifice debauchery pledge. Which one do you think holds up under pressure?
@SenMikeLee And even Another DEAL Like Corn Husker and Louisiana Purchase-  the Kentucky Dam Deal   $2 Billion for Mitch McConnell
@SenMikeLee 100% correct!! That is the way it's going to go for years to come if we don't get it together!! #Benghazi
@SenMikeLee awww were you not invited to the adult conversation? #tcot
@SenMikeLee @vmpcott Barack Obama Orders Up More Divide And Conquer To Win 2014 (WHI Related) http://theulstermanreport.com/2013/10/18/barack-obama-orders-up-more-divide-and-conquer-to-win-2014-whi-related/ … … …
@SenMikeLee explain why obamacare is bad without using headline arguments like "it cuts jobs" ... I'll wait....
@SenMikeLee I hear caves in the mountains are nive this time of year maybe you should move there
@SenMikeLee @SAMROD2935  the #stenographer2016  only 1 to trust ...
@SenMikeLee That is exactly how so many women are forced and coerced into abortions.  Think about it.  65% of all abortions are coerced.
@rdr45 @SenMikeLee Ocare and Amnesty is the perfect storm to kill America. One day .@SenTedCruz will be proven right.
@SenMikeLee @luvGodncountry We have a weak cowardly party. Care only about themselves Not the ppl. TY SenMikeLee & @SenTedCruz you tried!
@cokeybest @vmpcott @SenMikeLee @luvGodncountry @SenTedCruz Ted Cruz and Mike Lee are superstars.
@SenMikeLee ACA will help 30Million. S&P says your shutdown cost Americans $24BILLION. Only an idiot would do what you are doing. Resign.
@SenMikeLee @NateHorton1 time for some leadership and diplomacy. I am tired of extremists. Neither side of the aisle is 100% right.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing with @SenTedCruz in support of the wishes of the American people. Please keep fighting for us.
@mayosdream @PaulKinkel @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz - ditto!
.@GotCinnamon @mayosdream @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 

this thing ain't over
@SenMikeLee but u &@SenTedCruz drew clear lines. WTP know where @GOP stands. We r grateful & will use info wisely @pinkartgurl59
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater  we have an unelected President in the White House, Pres Valerie. Not supposed to be a co-chair position
@SenMikeLee @vmpcott We need to fire every democrat for 100 years to come.
@SenMikeLee @millman85 if it's a "deal" then it wasn't forced braniac
@SenMikeLee Is it true in this bill that KY gets a few bil$$$ for a dam?EXPOSE THIS TRAVESTY...
@SenMikeLee @LilSouthernSass Thank you Mike for standing with your constituents and make our voices heard. Sorry about the Mitch and McCain
@SenMikeLee Sad that the establish't GOPs care only big donors. They'r no difference than the Progressive!
@SenMikeLee warriors who are also ethical leaders are a blessing...you are blessing to all of us.
@SenMikeLee It would be awesome if both pathetic platitude aware parties wld legislate out of real concern & not fake emergency mind set
@SenMikeLee @LilSouthernSass Don't believe Ted Cruz is giving up,he did what he had to so Gov would reopen.Cruz won't quit,he has more fight
@Jodiandrow @LilSouthernSass @SenMikeLee 17% bureaucrats laid-off w/pay isn't a shutdown! Cruz counted & knew Senate was lost.
@SenMikeLee @EricStrobel Thank you Senator.  This TED DIRT NORTH GEORGIA Man IS PROUD of you.  SOUTHERNERS like GRIT. You have it!
@SenMikeLee @LilSouthernSass the way it started was with lies and the way it ended...more lies
@SenMikeLee Thank you for continuing to fight for the people. God Bless You!
@SenMikeLee @cleopattraUSA It seems 2 end with McConnell being bought 4 $3billion deal. I guess Obama just buys votes when he needs them
@gapper53 @SenMikeLee Probably with money provided by Obama's socialist mentor, George Soros.
I have a list! RT @cleopattrausa: @gapper53 @SenMikeLee Probably with money provided by Obama's socialist mentor, George Soros.
@RedScareBot  What kind of list?
.@SenMikeLee @karindarby It will because you allow McConnell to be bought. But its ok we Americans expect that from you guys.
@SenMikeLee @CalRWinn Forced? Or made to appear forced?
@Sarge1208 @SenMikeLee HAHAHA
@SenMikeLee @RadicalGrambo So very well said! Senator Lee you have covered yourself with HONOR
@SenMikeLee @CalRWinn with bribes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee @InWithFlynn2014 thank you for your efforts...we little people appreciate it, but it's hopeless.
@font4842 @SenMikeLee never never never give up.-Churchill.  If Washington gave up after he lost a hard battle, where would we be?
@InWithFlynn2014 @font4842 @SenMikeLee I am litterly in tears over this... Our country us lost..I can see nothing good in our future..
@SenMikeLee How abt a bill defining #highcrimes as crimes or breach of laws W/O enforcement mechanism commited by those in gov't/in charge w
@SenMikeLee @just4given As Sen Reid said the American people will never know the hard work he does behind the scenes...
@Lindarsey @SenMikeLee - beautiful.  You found a half truth I overlooked. Well said! Probably just another unintended liberal consequence :)
@SenMikeLee Absolutely correct!  Right is right no matter how many or how few believe it. Facts are stubborn things, they don't change!
@SenMikeLee Strange, you of all people complaining about something being forced on the people when you were driving the USA bus off a cliff.
@SenMikeLee ABSURD.
.,@SenMikeLee @jeweliaob Dud you all know what this bill had added to it?! Sounds like rotten dirty politics to me.
@SenMikeLee thoughts on 14th amendment? People say it makes debt ceiling unconstitutional. Control, purse, and debt with a balanced budget.
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson isn't that the way stuff is done in hell hole that is Chicago ??
@Abvthelaw @lsferguson @SenMikeLee Welcome to Chicago, Murder Capital USA, aka hub to Mex. drug cartel.Thanks for sending them lots of guns!
@SenMikeLee question, after you're done blowing Ted Cruz...does he let you spoon with him? He looks like a selfish lover, I'm guessing no
@SenMikeLee You ceaseless squeals amuse me. #butthurt
@SenMikeLee with only 81 yes votes to boot...wait
@SenMikeLee @joethepatriotic - trolls are out tonight!
@SenMikeLee Same $&!#, different day!
@SenMikeLee and McC gets his perk for the price of our freedom. Disgusting.
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson Yeah right.
@SenMikeLee That's the way government works. We've grown to expect it. Why do you think there's so much apathy & cynicism toward politics?
@SenMikeLee Romney lost the election. The people spoke last year dude.
@SenMikeLee @joethepatriotic I expected this mini "made up" crisis to end no other way.  NO MORE DEBT INCREASES
@SenMikeLee @KLSouth thank you for your effort Sen. Lee we all noticed. You will be rewarded
@jimmadill @GlockLady @SenMikeLee @KLSouth  Thank you Sen Lee we are with you & Sen Cruz!
@SenMikeLee @sbethcarp See @McConnellPress  got some nice pork in the deal too, this is what is SO wrong in DC, It smells
@SenMikeLee @lookupfolks someday soon the "kick-the-can" Road will be a deadend....my grandchildren are doomed.
@SenMikeLee forced by a small ideological minority that was hurting American families. Approval poll reflect UT's gratitude-congrats!
@SenMikeLee Much appreciated, Mike!
@SenMikeLee Why does the electorate put up with this crap?!? @Lrihendry
@SenMikeLee "last-minute back-room deal forced on Congress & the American people."

Yet, this deal is necessitated by you and Ted.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for the fight Too bad the R's in the Senate put kickbacks before integrity.
@SenMikeLee @JudgeLucas  Did McConnell get $2bil to sell us out?  #NotARepublicanAnymore  I'm done.  Registered Unaffiliated today.
.@SenMikeLee @DecisionZero with @McConnellPress selling the GOP for 30 pieces of silver AKA 2 BILLION in earmarks. #judas #shameless
@SenMikeLee @ullikemike  Mike,thank you ! Give them hell...
@SenMikeLee so sad.  But sir you are welcome at my table.  Thank you for your hard work standing up for the constitution.
@SenMikeLee I will remember all this when I VOTE...
@tedcruz @MicheleBachmann @TPPatriots @SenMikeLee @Mike_USPatriot With a $2 Billion bribe to McConnell! Disgraceful and disgusting!
@SenMikeLee Working with idiots like you ensures that good outcomes are reached inspite of idiots like you. Glad ur shutdown is over. $24B
@SenMikeLee don't do it!
@SenMikeLee @DosMasCervezas can you say the Kentucky kick back
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Thank you for your Integrity, at least 2 people still have their souls in DC #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee @copperpenny222 @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @tedcruz Thanks Lee/Cruz for you fight.  Sorry Arizona has 2 losers in the Senate.
@gwhazz @copperpenny222 @SenMikeLee @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @tedcruz Arizona's Senators are as bad as mine @SenatorBoxer @SenFeinstein
@SenMikeLee The only thing "Forced" on the American people was the #GOPshutdown that held us hostage. I hope UT gets wise and votes you out!
@SenMikeLee    Sickening.
@SenMikeLee Hear page #47 has a 6 figure pay off deal for a constituant in NJ, and a lot of "ear marks".
@SenMikeLee Lottenburgh family got $147K. Aren't they millionnaires already? @SenatorReid @SenateDems @Senate_GOPs What other pork?Clean CR?
@SenMikeLee  know u did ur best. Prepare 4 the next battle. Washington didn't win the war without losing battles. Truth will win in the end.
@SenMikeLee Yes, thanks to you and your counterparts in the House. Can't wait to see the fallout next election.
@SenMikeLee I look forward to you getting bounced at the nomination convention just like Bob Bennett.
@SenMikeLee Not if the faithful 'just say no'!
@SenMikeLee @carlisledeeann thank you Senator for fighting for us!
Can @SenMikeLee find a #backdoor and leave already?  #worthless #tool
@SenMikeLee like this was ever going to end any other way... @BenHowe
@SenMikeLee this is sickening.  This country is lost.   Not my America anymore.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your stand, Senator.
@SenMikeLee I am proud of you and Ted Cruz.  Our founding fathers are also pleased with your efforts.
@SenMikeLee thank you for your valiant efforts with @SenTedCruz, and 17 other GOP Sen who are living up to their promises. We know who didnt
@SenMikeLee Wow, lots of dumb and hateful trolls right about now. #TolerantLeft
.@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing your ground for the American people! By 2014, even most on the left will understand Obamacare was a lie
@SenMikeLee Tear down those doors Sen. Cruz and Sen. Lee, let America see what goes on in the back room.  Expose the dealings and lying!
@SenMikeLee Stand your ground Sir! While many of your fellow Senators lack the moral courage to be responsible we stand with you!
@SenMikeLee hang tuff Mike, and thanks!!!
@SenMikeLee you're an idiot.  Going to enjoy voting against you.
@SenMikeLee My sincere thanks for all you have done, we are indebted.
@SenMikeLee @rainsUSA unfortunately nobody is shocked by this news. #Liberty #Awake
@SenMikeLee If you want to repeal or change #Obamacare, win elections. Elections have consequences Senator, surprised you did not know that.
@SenMikeLee OBAMACARE WAS NO BACK ROOM DEAL & SCOTUS RULED IT CONSTITUTIONAL. WHEN YOU DO THE DEVIL'S WORK YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TELL LIES!
@SenMikeLee We are not walking away empty handed, not really. Chin up, valiance is priceless.
@SenMikeLee Obamacare forced upon us? Why are you trying to rewrite history? Plus it was McConnel that made the deal so shut up!
@SenMikeLee Senator, if you or Ted Cruz aren't the nominee in '16, I'm not voting again. I'm done.
@SenMikeLee Poor Mikey & Tea Party. Did you forget to mention that the back-room had the Republican minority leader in the room? More lies.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for fighting Mike and Ted @SenTedCruz , we are NOT giving up on doing the right things for America and our Constitution
@SenMikeLee Nah Mr. Lee, it's likely going to end by Americans taking back our country the hard way. Thanks for all you do. #FightForFreedom
@SenMikeLee Teahadist!
@SenMikeLee : and the American people lose. Thank you for talking a stand
Good to know we can depend on .@SpeakerBoehner & .@McConnellPress when the going gets tough, unlike .@SenMikeLee & @SenTedCruz's principles!

@SenMikeLee How were u planning to win w 52 Dems, 2 Indprnts, 46 GOPrs,1 Dem WH?Support dialogue/debate;how were u going to win by the math?

Would Jesus look for ways to keep people from seeing a doctor? 
You embarrass all Mormons.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for the fight
@SenMikeLee Does this mean while the #IRS spies on Christains and Conservatives, we eventually will pay the bills but won't have healthcare?
@SenMikeLee please don't give up. Thank you for doing the right thing.
@SenMikeLee Thank you sir, for representing millions of us, for trying on our behalf, by using the constitution as you could.
@SenMikeLee @tedcruz @SenatorSessions @SenRandPaul please for the good of America don't stop fighting for our values and beliefs
@SenMikeLee So, you're clearly organizing an effort to block cloture, right?
@SenMikeLee Keep fighting Obama and Obamacare! Thanks for the fight
@SenMikeLee Thank you for fighting.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for all that you tried to do. We appreciate it...  God bless
@SenMikeLee And the concession from Democrats is that #AffordableCareAct provision of verifying eligibility has to actually be followed?
@SenMikeLee And all who vote for this are begging to retire! #LetCleanHouse!
@SenMikeLee this isn't the end, this is one obstacle we will get past, keep fighting...millions of Americans are behind you!
@SenMikeLee Oh shut up. You are donzo in 2016.
@SenMikeLee Would it be possible for someone to send me a complete budget breakdown. All debits and credits etc. Would love a look at it
@SenMikeLee #Obamacare was voted & written 100% Democrats. Yet they are 1st in line to refuse this wonderful #healthcare shoved on us! #tcot
@SenMikeLee Sadly, I agree with you. Thanks for all you did. 2014 is coming...

@SenMikeLee Do you even think about the irony of your tweets before publishing? "FORCED"?  Really?!
@SenMikeLee The shutdown yes, the fight against Obamacare though will continue into the foreseeable future.
@SenMikeLee God bless you & others who took a stand for the hard-working people in America who are taxed enough already.
@SenMikeLee Please come home and face your constituents.
@SenMikeLee just stop embarrassing yourself.. just stop..
