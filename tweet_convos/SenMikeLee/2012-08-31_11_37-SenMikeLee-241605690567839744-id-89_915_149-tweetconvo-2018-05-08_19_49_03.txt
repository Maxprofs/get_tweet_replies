@SenMikeLee @Senate_GOPs republicans on the Senate budget committee have been empty chairs for the last three years. What have u done?
@SenMikeLee it would be nice if @SenatorReid let ANYTHING past him and his agenda.
@SenMikeLee sad , and the Dems have had to talk to EMPTY headed  Republicans.

@SenMikeLee Do you realize how stupid it is to have spent 5  trillion more money that we didnt have. $16 trillion is Obama's lagacy
@SenMikeLee If you call empty chair stopping the insanity of spending money you do not have then I agree.

@SenMikeLee @KMPHR Maybe if you would take responsibility for your own votes, folks might respect you. Debt ceiling fiasco comes to mind.
@SenMikeLee Maybe if the Republicans ever said anything worth listening to, the chairs would be full. All they do is tell incredible lies.
@SenMikeLee YesbecauseTea nincompoops who've come to change the Congress into the vision of RasputinNorquist,are incapable OfMakingItWork!:)
@SenMikeLee Might as well talk to empty chairs, you have to talk to an empty suit in the WH

@SenMikeLee @WestCoastGal88 It appears more Sen & Rep do not even show up to even try to accomplish something.Those need to be "let go".
@SenMikeLee We the people talked to empty heads when dems was cramming Obamacare down our throats
@SenMikeLee we do understand that is part and parcel of Harry Reid plan and to blame it on GOP. Uneducated voters believe him unfortunately
