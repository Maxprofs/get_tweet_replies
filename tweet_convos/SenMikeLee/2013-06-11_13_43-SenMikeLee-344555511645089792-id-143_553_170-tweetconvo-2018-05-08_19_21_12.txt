@SenMikeLee Please tell the #LowInformationRepublicans to listen to @RushLimbaugh. Damn they are DUMB. End of America.
I'm getting mighty tired of all these crises coming down the pike! I'm ready for better times. @HarrietBaldwin @SenMikeLee @rushlimbaugh

@SenMikeLee @SummerSksr888 - Thank you !
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing on principle, as so many did not. #NOAMNESTY #NOCHAINMIGRATION #NOANCHORBABIES #SEALTHEBORDERS #RULEOFLAW
@SenMikeLee @PJKirk9 The Orwellian name "comprehensive immigration reform" is an oxymoron for "incomprehensible imgrnt destabilization" bill
@SenMikeLee I say no amnesty, close the borders. Deportation  24/7. We have a law. Enforce it.
You are with and for the American People, thank you ! @SenMikeLee
@JustOrchids1 @SenMikeLee @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio @SenRandPaul @JohnCornyn Stupidity is EPIC! No thought to future, just personal $$ now
@SenMikeLee @dhrxsol1234 thank you
@Wondasioux @SenMikeLee Keep up the good work Mike!  I like Mike!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for standing with the tax paying middle class.  Your courage and leadership are inspiring.
That bill @SenMikeLee rewards wanton & willful disregard for our current laws (no matter how flawed) and is plainly #amnesty! @gopconference
@SenMikeLee @GH719 no immigration bill until the border is secured
@SenMikeLee @vonzion Thank you mike!!!
.@SenMikeLee @trucker4america thanks, you tried!
@SenMikeLee Thank you for voting against this abomination. Best wishes for honesty in government.
@SenMikeLee @navy8r good for you!!!
@SenMikeLee  Glad u voted against grang of 8 bill. It's just another way to break America down by supporting the world's poor.
@SenMikeLee @fredtkennedy  Thank You for sticking to your guns with immigration.  Step by Step is best.
@SenMikeLee Stupid, as usual. You're a hopeless stooge.
Why doesn't the gov't enforce the immigration laws already on the books - would solve 90% of the problems!!! > @SenMikeLee @POTUS7
@Tierrah46 @SenMikeLee If we did, then we would be called racist by this administration, demonized then lectured that we are world cutizens.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for voting the right way on the immigration motion.
@SenMikeLee @AndyTho10107697 stand strong Senator Lee!

@SenMikeLee THAT'S. the kind of Tweet I wanna c from a Rep. What he is doing to stop the avalanche of Socialist crap.

@SenMikeLee @patriot32 Thank you Senator! We can count on you. Never let DC change you like it has so many others. @marcorubio @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee @patriot32 Thank you Sen Lee..We need so many more like you!!..@marcoRubio has proved to be a Major  Mistake We need to remedy!
@SenMikeLee @MrsVerCrouse thewy do not want to reform immigration THEY want amnesty and BORDERS will NEVER be closed>
@SenMikeLee @MrsVerCrouse Thank you Sir
@SenMikeLee 1)seal the borders 2)streamline the immigration process, THEN 3)offer path to legalization. Any other plan is irresponsible.
@SenMikeLee Thank You, !!

@SenMikeLee @Gunny2862  Thank you, Mike, for being one of the few SANE people in Congress. IMMIGRATION REFORM = SECURE BORDERS
@SenMikeLee OK, and this is what we need. Debate and offering up other solutions. I have not heard your ideas, though, out here in NM.
@SenMikeLee Thank you so much! Repeating past failures won't work. #SEALTHEBORDERSFIRST This is another amnesty. Don't reward criminals!
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU! Y do they vote for cloture w/a huge majority but want " significant changes" to actually pass the bill? @ChristiChat
@SenMikeLee .Just like Ted Cruz. You whine and complain but offer no other ideas.
@SenMikeLee 
Thank you sir!
@SenMikeLee Thanks for taking a stand.
@SenMikeLee Unlike Rand Paul, Marco Rubio & other so-called conservatives, u sir, have upheld your oath of office. Congrats. Must be lonely.
