@KandiRider @DailySignal If you do not completely repeal Obamacare the Republican party is finished
I am ashamed that you support this travesty. Utahns will loose coverage & die w/no healthcare, all on your head.
please please please repeal obama care i dont have it i have had to pay a penalty every year for refusing it. tell Pres Trump dont obama us

GOP gonna be in for a surprise next election when they will be added to "purge" list if they oppose
Please don't give in on this. You are our voice, Trump has bailed..it's up to freedom members to be firm
Go ahead and do it. :D
will there be coverage for @jasoninthehouse to be reunited with me?
But we need a viable replacement first!
I voted for the President, but PLEASE save us from Obamacare Lite!! Repeal it 100% or use Senator @RandPaul's plan!
@JohnTDolan @DailySignal keep up the fight to get what we voted for. Don't care 1 cent about lobbyist #WeThePeople
You ALL must get in a room and get a deal as the Republicans are looking bad with all infighting in the media
I don't trust @SpeakerRyan. I think he's got intentions that aren't in line with @realDonaldTrump, nor the People.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/03/21/trumps-lies-are-failing-him-and-it-is-making-him-deeply-frustrated/?tid=pm_opinions_pop â€¦ LOL. I don't trust the con artist.
Agreed
RU willing to have same coverage as your constituents?24 MM+ uninsured Americans?Costs $$+? Vote NO on AHCA. We're listening and watching.
Party before country, whatever the cost. Today's #GOP
But don't replace it! Let the free market do its job. Gov should get the hell out of the health care business!
@carolinagirl63 @DailySignal And maybe Speaker Ryan too!
@carolinagirl63 @DailySignal Of @SpeakerRyan cannot understand that and get it done. He must resign. #GetErDone! #REPEAL FIRST!
That's he correct answer.  Thank you for standing your ground.  @ConserValidity @DailySignal
No sir Senator.
@Pjw20161951 @DailySignal . We voted for the GOP. Do your D.... job for heaven sakes. U failed Trump. Get to work
Doesn't the Senate pass their own bill and then negotiate the House and Senate bill into one WHERE IS YOUR BILL?
Well, the current version of the ACA replacement does not do better, unless you are an insurance company because they are people
The GOP has mishandle this from start. 50 repeals that meant nothing no replacement bad messaging.
Mr. Lee Please include healthcare sharing in healthcare reform. & also ensure the 30% continuous coverage penalty does not apply. Thanks
Regardless of how may people lose their insurance #hypocrisy
We either need to petition @SpeakerRyan to resign or he steps down. He will never truly back this movement #MAGA
You're just another NEVER TRUMPER. NO credibility. We need to hear from people that put principles before personalities.
thank Senator. Poor people don't need health care. I love trumpcare. It's going  to squeeze filthy poor people. Yay
and with the garbage you propose we will keep our promise to see you retired
you must keep your promise to give every American access to health insurance.
@GQinNC @DailySignal we are with you. Each bill passed by GOP was a repeal bill. Not a repeal bill.
Lee backs Ryans population control plan to hurt as many poor & senior Americans while giving rich tax breaks
Paul Ryan is a puppet. Too many in Congress are. @POTUS should only support #RepealFirst
@KatyinIndy @DailySignal Doesn't look good from where I'm sitting Mike 
Mike why aren't u exposing the dirty truth of why Ryan & GOP establishment cronies are doing this? Get a damn spine
Remember, you get 1 shot at this. So far the replacement is NOT good. We can do better!
You realize that people actually like to have health care right? Taking it away does not make them free.
free to die is what I think they say
You need to get rid of trader Ryan
But not with the disastrous RyanCare ACHA. Vote No to ACHA.
My vote for this bill is NO...   Just repeal the ACA for now, effective 2018, then get busy...
repeal, then replace.
wouldn't expect otherwise. Of course you have to keep your promises to the rich and screw over the American people
plse consider use of nuke option if needed to bring real reform, thx
Repeal Obamascare now OR we'll Repeal & Replace... YOU!
expand it, or watch your party implode.
RYAN IS LOBBYING FOR BLUE CROSS .. DRAIN THE SWAMP
Amen
AS A CONSUMER HAVING A CHOICE .. I CHOOSE NOT TO PAY DIRECTLY TO INSURANCE COMPANIES .. WE NEED YOU MIKE
Not if you care for less well off Americans. Or older 50 to 64 who will get hammered. Trumpcare is foreseeable junk
and promise of cheaper,everyone covered??You get to pick which is a promise an which just a lie. You sir are a tool
@FreedomWorks @DailySignal and no RINO BS where there are still hidden mandates & high premiums for seniors.
We elected Donald Trump. You need to support him
@FreedomWorks @DailySignal Then get RID of Ryan and his cronies!!!
PLEASE KEEP UP THE FIGHT AGAINST THESE RINO/REPUKEIN BASTARDS
trumpcare is a travesty Americans aren't stupid, scrap phase 1, republicans will be wear a scarlet letter "R" 2018

@FreedomWorks @DailySignal It won't happen. Just a  with another name. Managed care kills protecting corp/govt expenditures.
this bill is no diff than dems did. Lying untrustworthy politicians screwing us again. Shameful!
then send the December 2015 repeal bill to President desk. Then, start from scratch. Use Rand Paul plan.
.@SenMikeLee @DailySignal it is better to let Obamacare implode than to put your name on a halfass repeal. Let Ocare implode!
Totally agree they need to be tared and feathered with it.
Quit talking and just do it. Tired of the talk. Action is required, now.
Why does it have to be at the expense of the poor and the elderly?
Work as a TEAM, stop fighting the TEAM in the MSM - work behind closed doors like all great teams
@FreedomWorks @DailySignal yes, yes you do! You promised and you work for us! We demand it, that's why you guys are in power
, stay strong Senator,Stich with Cruz,Paul, Jordan and all other principaled patriots.
get RYINO OUT!
Stand tall.  Complete repeal. Side on Rand Paul's proposal. RyanCare against all us voting on Full Repeal premise.
@FreedomWorks @DailySignal Even if nos of uninsured rises higher than be4 Affordable Care Act. Do poor figure in your ideology?
Lee doesn't care about the poor. He's a Christian and I guess that's not in there
What about your promise to represent Utah?
party first
Be sure Congress has to participate in the next healthcare scam!
repeal it then let states do Health Care NOT Insurance
from what I am hearing and seeing, new HC bill is O/C lite,we didn't vote for it to just be renamed @SpeakerRyan
Thank you Senator #MikeLee for Standing Up and being a Leader Against this Disaster of ObamaCare!  #FULLREPEAL NOW!
Then @HouseGOP & @SenateGOP BETTER it together! 7yrs "We will #repeal !" 7 yrs we voted @GOP into majority4 this?
... wake up @SpeakerRyan ... you're blowing it ...
it has to be better and less expensive than obama care or don't bother. Work it !
@RandPaul
Looking forward to hearing you speak about this tomorrow afternoon!
#FullRepeal #RandsPlan #RandAid
Yes we need to get a  better bill.
Okay 
after that How about make a plan on what u get & all Fed empl. get from Gov't if good for u good for people
you really don't have to.
i apreciate you.  Keep up the good fight on healthcare
Sen.Mike LEE of UTAH, Good Tuesday!
@manchogagog @DailySignal damn straight Mike! That was the promise! That's what's expected!
Because tautology.  Not because it helps anyone, or is a good idea, but because you promised.
Fix it, just like the President promised. Don't make it worse for the American people.
Yes and so many other promises effectively blocked by antiquated Senate Rules (esp XXII). @SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr
No socialized medicine!  Full repeal, full stop.
the promise was "repeal and replace", but your replacement is honestly insulting. Americans are going to die over this!
PLEASE! The #RINOcare plan is HIDEOUS. The @POTUS must be made aware of this. I'd like your thoughts on @RandPaul's plan.
*sigh* Again: first read, then review, then reform-with both parties @ the table preferably #ACA #RepealAndReplace
exactly. They're pushing this through recklessly
@POTUS pay attention @SpeakerRyan is driving the Trump train into a ditch
