@SenMikeLee You do know the "government" is made up of, and voted in by, Americans, right?
@UGottaLovItBaby I'm quite sure he does. He's referring 2 ones in power that have let it go 2 their heads, u know that, right?@SenMikeLee
@LadyConserv You mean those ones who misuse their power & shutdown the gov't (which punishes people), like....@SenMikeLee?
@UGottaLovItBaby Pay ATTENTION !!!! The liberals led( if u can call it leading) by Obama REFUSE to negotiate!  @SenMikeLee
@LadyConserv @SenMikeLee Why should they? "Obamacare" is a law. It's already been "negotiated." If GOP wants to change it, find the votes!
@UGottaLovItBaby Not going to be a problem as soon as ppl SEE what the cost of their premiums will be. Signed up yet? @SenMikeLee
@LadyConserv @SenMikeLee I already have ins. so I'm not signing up and my premiums have stayed the same.
@UGottaLovItBaby Ur not going to KEEP ur insurance, Pal. @SenMikeLee
Especially Liberals under the guise of some grandeous plan to help some cause. @SenMikeLee @CherylRenetteBa
@JrcheneyJohn @SenMikeLee Like winning back the House in 2014??
Holding the House & taking the Senate in 2014 is a must do. @CherylRenetteBa @SenMikeLee
@JrcheneyJohn @SenMikeLee Absolutely!! W/out it OB will do immensely more damage than he has already done!!
I have never had this much fear for our Country, Obama's overreach never ends  @CherylRenetteBa @SenMikeLee
@JrcheneyJohn @CherylRenetteBa @SenMikeLee I'm feeling the same way but we're going to fight.
@wendeebendee @JrcheneyJohn @SenMikeLee  I am not giving up either!!
We've got a Hell of a lot of fight left in us, we're not dead yet @CherylRenetteBa @wendeebendee @SenMikeLee

@SenMikeLee @cgnnightmare Did you know the families of those KIA are being denied death benefits#delusional #DontBlink #shutdown
@SenMikeLee Thank you Senator and Stand Strong, we are with you.
@SenMikeLee AND KILL AMERICANS
@SenMikeLee which means its time to throw them out.
@SenMikeLee You are misusing your power for personal gain and glory.
@SenMikeLee Like minority of minority, feels bruised egos tops majority rules. #MikeLee & #Cruz use power to advance own interests over USA.
@SenMikeLee The abuse of power by governments is only limited by what they believe they can get away with. This is the truth history reveals
@SenMikeLee @dennygirltwo I think federal lands belong to the people can we arrest him yet?
@SenMikeLee @balf1980  My big ? is, WTH do you let him get away with it? IMPEACHMENT in order. Race war or revolution, take your pick!
@SenMikeLee @jacquestoddard keep working to shrink the size of gov. As the gov grows our freedom shrinks #tcot
@SenMikeLee @Shirleystopirs  EVERY meeting, EVERY conversation, every VOTE, shld be public record. Doing ppl's business - IS ppl's business.
@SenMikeLee @Shirleystopirs  De-centralize govt. Elected reps shld represent their constituents from AMONGST them. Why must they BE in D.C.?
@SenMikeLee @JimDarcy2  Government headed by radical liberals such as Obama, et al, will most assuredly harm Americans, he hates Americans.
For this Admin, @SenMikeLee , *especially* if it means punishing Americans! It should be criminal and impeachable!
@SenMikeLee  In progress
@SenMikeLee @jonzies IS using and MISUSING its power.
@SenMikeLee Government looses sight of their employers. The bosses are waking up and voicing their displeasure at their misuse. @LindaSuhler
@SenMikeLee @LindaSuhler Thank you Senator Lee for standing up for our Constitution!
this #shutdown showed everyone gov too big. Let go of #obamacare and talk debt @SenMikeLee We need grown ups in the room #allagreeonthat
@SenMikeLee Now all Americans have experienced being BULLIED! Except for the administration, of course!
@SenMikeLee lol yea we knew that already. Its been this way since the dawn of civilization. Power corrupts people.
@SenMikeLee @WhackobirdLisa The American people have lost their voice in DC.  Representatives that "represent" the ppl are becoming extinct
@SenMikeLee http://www.examiner.com/article/obamacare-can-be-defunded-without-senate-approval …         read this MIKE,  this is not the law on obamacare .. #dirtyharry can not do this read it
Americans being able to purchase affordable health insurance is "punishing Americans"?
Up is down. Left is right.
@SenMikeLee
@SenMikeLee This shows exactly WHY ObombAcare should be defeated. Next shutdown will deny healthcare FIRST.
@SenMikeLee Thank you & @SenTedCruz for standing up & persuading the House to stand with you. We the People are with you. #DontBlink
@SenMikeLee I would hope the "enforcers" would understand they work for we the people, the punished taxpaying, salary paying Americans.
@SenMikeLee the reference is to those who abuse their power and the bureaucracy!
@SenMikeLee So true! Thank you for your fortitude, truthfulness, and perserverance!
@SenMikeLee republicans are hurting america and abusing power. obama is standing up for americans and their health.
@SenMikeLee you misspelled "tea party" - it isn't spelled "government. "
@SenMikeLee We're behind you! You can't see us but believe in our fight for you! We LOVE America and we're working hard to restore her glory
.@SenMikeLee the evidence is all around us. Please continue to fight for defund, fundamental reforms to Obamacare, energy, entitlements
@SenMikeLee Ahhh - the truth!
@SenMikeLee speaking of punishment, why are 20% of the minority party punishing everyone? #TeaPartyShutdown http://www.salon.com/2013/10/07/poll_vast_majority_of_americans_disapprove_of_gops_shutdown_stance/ …
@SenMikeLee You are the one misusing your power to advance your own interests and punishing Americans, you jackass.
@SenMikeLee @BrainwashThis disagree. Not "Govt"... that was fine. 
It is POLITICIANS who misused their power. Get what your saying though.
@BrainwashThis @SenMikeLee Yep, Lo-info or party-line voters have no idea how dangerous their actions can be to our great country.
@SenMikeLee #obama & #dems trying 2 cause as much #pain & disruption as possible on @USPublic 4 personal gain tells U #allUneed2know
@SenMikeLee  This is seen clearly now
@SenMikeLee TWO OBAMA VOTERS CALLED RUSH FURIOUS @DEMS.ACA THEIR RATES GOING UP BY $1600/yr... YOU GUYS CUD BACK OFF LET THIS #FALLONITSOWN
@SenMikeLee Thank you for speaking up for Americans. Our Government's temper tantrums and lawlessness are dangerous!
@SenMikeLee @LadyConserv Thank You for Standing up for us!!!
@SenMikeLee #PresidentStompyFoot will abuse his power to advance its own interests while punishing Americans: http://ow.ly/pAjLJ  Creep!
@SenMikeLee Keep shining the sun light on them Sen. Thank you
@SenMikeLee At least this admin has that attitude. @BarackObama  #MakeDCListen
@SenMikeLee at least you can admit it.
@SenMikeLee Is abuse of power/office grounds for impeachment? If so, get'er done. It's Congress' responsibility. Protect Americans.
@SenMikeLee YOU are the one who is punishing Utah citizens - you should be ASHAMED!!!
@SenMikeLee Its own interests? That makes this "government" not only illegitimate, but CRIMINAL
@SenMikeLee I wish u would run for prez senator! I would then have more trust in gov!
@SenMikeLee punished by Obama. I am unable to attend my sons wedding cause I have to be at work, "essential" non furloughed VA employee
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your leadership, Senator. Stand strong.
