@SenMikeLee Unless u guys figure out how to get your message out pass MSM I fear this bite you. Ppl need to see the reality of it.
.@mymac24 Once done it won't be undone. They'll just patch it. There will be no moment of clarity on the left that Ocare was a big mistake.
@DonnaBee511 I agree with you but I fear we have passed done. I have grown tired of my party's  ability to lose these fights.
@mymac24 I'm on team Let-It-Burn myself. :-)
@DonnaBee511 :-) I think some buyers remorse is needed. Lol if that's possible
@SenMikeLee @TallJohnSilver   Stop being pussies and grow some balls defund Obamacare and then shut down the amnesty bills.
.@SenMikeLee You're pretending that Sen. Dems will be responsible for shutting down the govt by not voting to defund #ACA? You have no honor
@SenMikeLee Nope, DEMs will squander the savings 1st, then blame GOP for everything. Gives Hillary something to run on.
@SenMikeLee @BARRYCUDA3 I don't know but Thank u @SenMikeLee  for your courage and determination to stop this
@SenMikeLee idiot
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @InhofePress @SenRandPaul I can guarantee that the Democratic party will NEVER win another election period!
@SenMikeLee .So you guys are willing to shut the government down when obamacare is a law. Your stupidity has no bounds.
@SenMikeLee Defund delay but fund gov't. Train wreck..20 mil left uninsured. Thank you!!
@SenMikeLee hopefullybeven the Republican numbskulls in the house are smarter than that. Shame on you Mike Lee
@SenMikeLee @mkues65 Good question hopefully we will find out. #DefundObamacare #Now #RedNationRising
@SenMikeLee God Bless you this is our last chanch
@SenMikeLee @SpeakerBoehner @GOPLeader Pls do this..defund, delay and fund gov't. 20 mil left uninsured. Health Savings!!
@SenMikeLee you are a waste. No ideas - just destroying our credit rating. Bigoted and bitter. Resign
@SenMikeLee Knowing how @johncornyn, @SenJohnMcCain , @LindseyGrahamSC , @lisamurkowski  operate,they will back Obama and Obamacare. Bet?
@SenMikeLee They will shut it down and blame you! Please keep fighting Mike!! your our last chance!!! Thank you!!  :)
@SenMikeLee What ever irrational decision they take, they will do it w their backs against d wall. #WeThePeople REJECT Obamacare completely.
.@SenMikeLee By passing a funding bill that they know Sen.Dems will vote against,it is House Repubs that'd be to blame for any govt shutdown
@SenMikeLee @mfrperez SHUT DOWN will equal #DefundIt
@SenMikeLee @pacsgirl36   ? Is does House have enough courage and strong leadership 2 DEFUND OBAMACARE? Sure hope so-need to rep Am ppl!
@SenMikeLee @Norsu2 How about securing the boarder with these socalled new middle east threats? Now would be the ultimate time to do so?
@SenMikeLee Let them blame @GOP. We know better. #Obamacare has to go. @BarackObama & @SenateDems will be choosing govt shutdown.
@SenMikeLee I honestly don't care if the Govt. gets funded. I will not support #ANYGOP who doesn't support you.
@SenMikeLee @presbo They will step in front of a moving train to protect Obama and Obamacare.
@DarlaQuinn3 @SenMikeLee .@I hear ya there. :(
@SenMikeLee I personally would like the government to shut down. As long as we have power & water we don't need Washington DC. Sorry. :-\
@SenMikeLee Good Point Sir Mike....
@SenMikeLee They will shut it down and the State Run Media will blame the Republicans.
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson Mike, The Senate is a disgrace. My Opinion, they would rather SAVE OBAMA THAN SAVE AMERICA! We need recalls!
@SenMikeLee @lsferguson I hope they do not. Can you say political suicide? TL
@SenMikeLee Time to find out.
Oh, and #Defund the #Obamacare #TrainWreck!!!!!!! Affordable care? It's NOT affordable when it costs MORE!!! @SenMikeLee
Shut it down! The States can do just fine without the Feds. @SenMikeLee
@Ltinsley72 @SenMikeLee @Tazmanian5 Can We also Defund Obama ?
@Ltinsley72 @SenMikeLee @Tazmanian5 Ob should be arrested for Treason,And all his MB buddies !!
@SenMikeLee @notyourkimmy They are obstructionists who care little for us "folks". They will shut down!
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater They will shut down gov't and Obama will go on a campaign tour blaming the GOP.  GOP response: PHONY SHUTDOWN !
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater The Americans who will B FORCED 2 pay 4 everyone's FREE obamacare stand with you~make o'care separate DO NOT FUND
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater  I'm really po that deal has been struck to exclude Congress & staffers.  Where's ours!!
@SenMikeLee  Rhetorical question..?
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater tell them to defund it to find out. After all they passed it just to see whats in it.
@SenMikeLee @TenNamesLater The House needs to defund. It is the law for all, or the law for none. NO exemptions!
@SenMikeLee Harry won't even touch it to protect the others from showing how they would vote.
@SenMikeLee We must get the media to report the true and only stories otherwise no matter what we will loose again!!!
@SenMikeLee We, the right, just keep telling ourselves the same things.  We need to reach everyone not just US.
@SenMikeLee thanks for standing up for what got you elected in the first place. You still have my support. #tcot #ObamaCare
@SenMikeLee You're a fraud and liar.
@SenMikeLee 45 lemons stopped background checks, but that won't stop us. #Lemons2Lemonade #MomsDemand
@SenMikeLee @vmpcott They will screw it up and blame someone else for their screw up. Same as the last 50-60 years...
@KevinRandall5 @SenMikeLee  That is the Democrat Way
@SenMikeLee I agree with you, but this is going to backfire on the GOP.  The establishment GOP will likely fold anyway.
@SenMikeLee dear senator. Thank you for standing up for our country.the dems and republs will do anything to get mire $$.they dont care!!
@SenMikeLee You're all so busy fighting each other NO ONE is getting anything done. Stop throwing rocks and start working together.
@SenMikeLee You're painting a contrast that doesn't exist. Everything you blame Democrats for doing, Republicans do also.
@SenMikeLee If they take a cue from what your team has done, they would shut things down right? #DoWhatISayNotWhatIDo
@SenMikeLee Defund & find out. Defunding is the first step & most important. Put the money where the mouth is & do it. It will be alright.
@SenMikeLee @GOPLeader Senator Lee, if we can get the House Leadership to stop doing Dem's bidding, we WILL find out!
@SenMikeLee No CR without stripping obamacare. Shut it down. We need to #STOPSPENDING anyway.
@SenMikeLee @OCAmericans They'll shut down the Government --after they have the media blame it on the Republicans & some how the Tea Party.
@SenMikeLee ,Illegal for Obama to exempt Congress: Congress's ObamaCare Exemption http://on.wsj.com/183B0uz  via @WSJ
@SenMikeLee @OCAmericans They will shut down the government and blame it on the Tea Party Republicans.
@SenMikeLee ACA is the LAW.  Get over it !  Where are the Jobs? Pass a Jobs Bills !
@SenMikeLee Illegal for Obama to exempt Congress: Congress's ObamaCare Exemption http://on.wsj.com/183B0uz  via @WSJ
@SenMikeLee It matters not what Obama will do; it only matters what Republicans believe he will do and how they respond to that belief.
@SenMikeLee Defund ObamaCare and let the chips fall where they may. I'm tired of Republicans worrying about what 'might' happen.
@SenMikeLee If House passes Bill to defund ACA House will be Shutting Down Govt . ACA is the Law when will they get that through there heads
@SenMikeLee Do it! Sadly, America will be better off with gov't shut down.
@senmikelee Just repudiate the fraudulent foreign debt, go directly through the US Treasury,don't pass go(eliminate the FED)and collect $200
@SenMikeLee Thanks for what you are doing!  Conservatives need to fight for more than "elect more Republicans and we will fix it."
@SenMikeLee Undoubtedly, they will shut it down. Still, #DefundObamacare because the people are with you, @SenTedCruz & @SenRandPaul.
@SenMikeLee @DanaBordeaux 

Shut it down. But who cares?
@SenMikeLee If things go as they have thus far theyll shut it down. Obama loves pulling out his presidential power card
@SenMikeLee Senator, please do what you have to do to defund Obamacare! please, for the sake of the USA
@1Oyster1 @SenMikeLee What are WE going to do to help?
@SenMikeLee: I'm pretty sure they'll shut it down. When's the last time most of them did the right thing?
