@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz Thank you for protecting and defending the integrity of our constitution. Keep up the good work, you are supported
@SenMikeLee  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Cowards all, you should have N_R_A tattooed on your cowtowing foreheads #sandyhook #newtown #guncontrol
@SenMikeLee For shame. Remember the 90%.
@SenMikeLee #ShameOnYou
@SenMikeLee  #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per dead child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction
@SenMikeLee Sen. say they're afraid of NRA. Your fear worth more than terror of mass-murdered 1st graders? Coward 4 hire. #DemandAction
#NRA threatened @SenMikeLee w election backlash. But NRA's #GOP candidates R losing.He betrayed dead 1st graders for nothing. #DemandAction
Yes, very rational - @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz #Protect2A NOT US Citizens. The #2ndAmendment obviously means use no prudence in who buys guns
@SenMikeLee A victory!! However, if Obama proceeds with EO's, it will be time to impeach & remove! http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/biden-president-already-lining-some-additional-executive-actions-guns_718027.html …
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz You should be ashamed of your vote in the Senate yesterday. More people will die from gun violence because of you.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Thank you for protecting the Second Ammendment. We may need our guns the way Obama leads from behind
@SenMikeLee http://bit.ly/15qwicb 
Sen Mike Lee ( @SenMikeLee ) voted NO on #guncontrol . Verdict: Bad Decision Maker, Weak/Puppet, Unqualified for Pub Office.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz What a horrible horrible thing. You should not be proud. You failed to make us safer. You're a disgrace to the US.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz You took an oath to uphold the #Constitution. Uphold this: A WELL REGULATED MILTIA BEING NECESSARY TO THE SECURITY
@SenMikeLee  You are a coward and a liar. You placed the comforts of your office above your country and the safety of its citizens.
@SenMikeLee you are part of the problem, clinging to the idea of a right instead of commonsense legislation to keep people safe.
@SenMikeLee can you scale back the 2nd Amendment so I can also buy a tank?  I've been saving up for it for a long time.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz Thank you for your work and standing up to fight Obamas false narrative and gun control freaks
@SenMikeLee Epic FAIL for America - our children deserve better.
@SenMikeLee Shame on you.
@SenMikeLee Thank you for using facts over emotions with your #guncontrol vote and for protecting our Constitution #2a @SenTedCruz
@SenMikeLee Assault weapons are not in the 2nd Ammendment, genius. Grow up & actually help ur country!!!
@SenMikeLee Thank you!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Well done, but it is time to orient onto #Obammigration before he can build enough momentum to be unstoppable.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz The #SecondAmendment is to protect against government overthrow. People will die. You have blood on your hands.
@SenMikeLee received $2,500 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2010. http://ow.ly/kaOfF  #NRALapdogs
@SenMikeLee  SHAME ON YOU .......................................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz You are a total disgrace to America. May your "vote" haunt you forever

@SenMikeLee thank you for helping to uphold the 2nd amendment right for me and my family. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Shame on you.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Don't worry your seat will be open soon. Preach 2nd Amendment to Newtown parents.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz You are a disgrace.
@SenMikeLee thanks for your support of our 2 nd amendment rights!
@SenMikeLee Hang your head in shame because your callous actions will result in more innocent children being senselessly gunned down.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz Outstanding and keep fighting for freedom!!
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz  They are not & never will be assault weapons. Assault weapons are already illegal without extra fed licenses.

@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Thanks for voting against anti-gun and anti-Constitutional legislation!
It has nothing to do with 2nd and you two know it. #Fail @SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz

@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz great job gentlemen. We couldn't have done it without men like you. @SenRandPaul
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz Thank you both for leading the way to uphold the constitution. #patriots
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz 1st Amend. is not threatened by ban on child porn, just as 2nd Amend, is not threatened by background checks.
@SenMikeLee @sentedcruz Great job. But the bill to support veterans' #2A rights failed.
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz @SenRandPaul thanks for protecting #2a also did you see this link?  two look prior service http://imgur.com/a/sUrnA 
@SenMikeLee @SenTedCruz Thank you. Please spread the word around the Senate:GOP Sens.McCain, Toomey and Kirk voted "yes." and face primaries
More American deaths prevail.
Not pro-life.
