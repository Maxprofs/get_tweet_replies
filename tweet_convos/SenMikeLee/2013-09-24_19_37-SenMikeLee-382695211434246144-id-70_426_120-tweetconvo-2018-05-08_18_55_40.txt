@SenMikeLee You and Cruz and Rubio would have worked well in the Nixon White house. Or even in the basement with Ollie North. Party First.
@SenMikeLee Thanks for supporting Cruz, Sir.  You are both a scholar and a gentleman.
@SenMikeLee I think Ted should filibuster by asking Pelosi, Tell us, now that the bill is passed just what is in it?
Exactly!“@SenMikeLee: I don't understand why voting to give Harry Reid power to gut the House defund bill is a vote in favor of House bill.”
@SenMikeLee Because they are only interested in a symbolic vote. I'm TIRED of symbolic votes! House/Senate Republicans should band together!
@SenMikeLee THANK YOU for STANDING for US. THANK YOU for RESPRCTING the working Americans, THANKS for STANDING w/Ted -  we r watching C-Span
@SenMikeLee Thank you for your service,sir!
@SenMikeLee we in Alabama support you and mr. Cruz......roll tide!
@SenMikeLee who do we need to be contacting??  I'll harass. cajole and persuade to senators who might care.
@SenMikeLee @mkibbe Sen Lee doesn't understand a lot of things, that is why he has lied to people. #CruzLeeObamacare
@SenMikeLee I have never heard anyone with a college degree be told, 'You are qualified but I can't hire you because of Obamacare
@SenMikeLee You are a good man and a rare breed in that town.
@SenMikeLee thank you!
@SenMikeLee Harry Reid is a disgrace to the office he holds! Thank you Senator Lee!

@SenMikeLee Sounds like your on the wrong side. Makes me wonder if your not just giving lip service when you say De-fund Obamacare?!
@SenMikeLee It's a communist trick for ppl who can't think. Reid must be stopped 1 way or another. #MakeDCListen
