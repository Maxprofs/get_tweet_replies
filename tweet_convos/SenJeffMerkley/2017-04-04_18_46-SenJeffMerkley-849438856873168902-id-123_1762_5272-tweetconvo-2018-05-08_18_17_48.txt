#HoldTheFloor #NoGorsuch My name is NO! My # is NO! My sign is NO! U need 2 let it go! @SenateMajLdr #ThisIsDemocracy #WeObject #NoGorsuch
NO equals nuclear option. Dingy Harry Reid open that door in 2013.
& #Traitor @SenateMajLdr kicked it down with #MerrickGarland FOH U need 2 let it go! #NoGorsuch My name is NO! My #= No! My sign=No!
I hope the Democrats are paying you good money.
who is paying U?
No one I been out of G** d@m F ing work for a month.
best advice I can give is from my Father's desk: Good luck!
When  Obama adm.& Dems turn wva into chaos jobwise attitude no miracle yes.
This is what real American heroism looks like. #holdthefloor
Real American hero's those who fought in wars. While they do this crap Assad use gas on his people.
I agree. I served aboard USS Tarawa for 4 years. Assad must go, as must Trump and Tillerson who enabled him with apathetic diplomatic policy
Democrats are going to cry about sending marines, Bradley fighting vehicles & m1 Abram tanks
So are the parents of those Marines. You think Trump,Tillerson,Kushner or Gannon give a shit about them? #holdthefloor
Sorry, typo. I meant Bannon
Republicans take better care of the military than Democrats do. They got please & run from activist.
Thank you @KamalaHarris
Justice is under investigation?
I don't know. Is that some of the bullshit Putin's paying you to spread?
they will cry like babies when nuclear option comes into play.
Yay! Thank you @SenJeffMerkley !
Unbelievable. We need Gorsuch confirmed!!
he's still speaking at 9:11am EST
@boomdcampbell @SenJeffMerkley Never give up.
It makes me feel a little better knowing there are Senators &Dem politicians who have our backs when the men at the top are tearing us down!
Considering it was @GOP blocking President Obama's rightful appointment to SCOTUS, I think @GOP deserves nothing less than this.
Yes go play in your sand box
Your turn, @KamalaHarris.
Disastrous?  Really?  #hyperbole
#resist
so disastrous he was unanimously confirmed to the federal appeals court a decade ago  be fair
A true hero!
Please join him Senator Harris!  As your constitutent, I am asking you to fight for us alongside Senator Merkley.
America is being ripped off by a DISHONEST Democrat Party, COLLUDING against an American Pres. Actively lying 2 bring @POTUS down.UR BAD PLP
The GOP are pushing a right wing, anti women's rights, conservative for the SUPREME COURT to go back in time.
Not having it.
Wait to see what you get when Ginsburg is gone lol
Actually gave me chills to think of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg not on the bench.
Whose up next?
Why is his nomination disastrous! Schumer etal supported his nomination in the past! You're an embarrassment to your state and nation
It does not make any difference for GOP will still confirm him with a simple majority. This was their plan all along.
SenJeffMerkley I thank and congratulate you,MereckGarland should be supremecourtjudge.
Too late idiot read or watch the news. Its all good Gorsuch is the supreme Court Justice. How great is that now you can go speak about that
By saying Gorsuch is a disastrous nominee you prove that you only care about yourself and not at all about the American people! Go away!
This is total BullShirtz. UDemocrats R involved N an active political coup against fellow Citizens @POTUS44 BHO surveillance.wRussian dreams
Good luck in the contest.
Thank you all for your tireless leadership !
Yes!! We all thank him,  hope he will have a marathon sleep after this!
LOL Awarding each other participation trophies. Hey Harris. Wait till 2nd & 3rd appointees are approved LMAO
Yep Gorsuch believe in constitution & law harris believe pedophile human traffickers rapist of unconscious have more rights than us
Thank you for supporting @SenJeffMerkley #holdthefloor
@TexArcana @SenJeffMerkley he just said Gorsuch plagiarized his book and in law school
Gorsuch could show patriotism and withdraw his name since he didnt reach threshold. @judgengorsuch do the honorable thing for your country.
Just love paying the salary of a bunch of losers than care more about politics than the country
Thank you, SenJeffMerkley. I voted for you. More importantly, you work for the common good of all Americans.
Fools who lose.....American Citizens have spoke with the vote get over it we won.
progressives destroy everything they touch / just lost big
@politico Broke story Gorsuch plagerized.  Please fight for a candidate worthy of being on the Supreme Court. #holdthefloor
why did I vote for you Harris? I thought you wouldnt be a partisan crony. Nothing more than obstructive and partisan. Hopefully you change
Thank you for fighting, Senators!
#HoldTheFloor
Excellent.  Thank you, Senators. Stay strong and #HoldTheFloor
Thank you!
Can't help but think you'd be doing the same thing if Trump nominated Merrick Garland. Your stance is purely based on partisan BS.
That's bull! If he'd nominated Garland, they would have confirmed! Aren't mean spirited as GOP!
Disastrous?
That describes entire Democrat beliefs, agenda.
#UnAmerican
#Treasonous
Boo! People have spoke. #confirmgorsuch
You'll regret that when Ginsberg retires or dies.
Kamala imagine the howls of derision if conservatives had filibustered any of Obama's nominees. You would be spitting blood.
#StopGorsuch #Holdthefloor
Dems are just mad because they didn't get Obama's nomination through. You know Gorsuch is highly qualified &respected and WILL be confirmed
Thank you for nothing.  You serve those who only serve themselves
DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
Thank you so much for being the frontline of our democracy.
We're a Republic, not a democracy #facts
Please please please filibuster Gorsuch!
Thank you ALL for standing up for us and our country!
#Gorsuchfilibuster
yep stand there like a fool cuz kamala wouldn't
No nominee while #trumprussia #russiagate is still in investigation
What does this talking all night prove? Is anyone listening?

Then you both will be crying when the  nuclear option comes in to play. At least you both got d@m jobs.
Reid rulewaste of his time. Thank you Harry Reid. 
U are crazy
Go help him!  You can speak too and help #holdthefloor
Is anyone helping Senator Merkley tonight?
Great job so far, @SenJeffMerkley. Thank you for calmly setting straight the MajLdr's decision to force the nuclear option.
@docrocktex26
@SenJeffMerkley talking  in order to #StopGorsuch  #HoldTheFloor!
Will you follow him, to keep this up as long as possible, Senator?

Haha Losers!
Despicable partisan plpy.

Why don't you wait until the last hours before the cloture vote before you hold the standing filibuster?  Force maximum drama.
A filibuster is wrong, you need to vote on this nomination.   Why are you putting America second to your political ambitions?
Nuclear time
Awesome!  More More More!
Thank you both for standing your ground! We patriots are proud! #HoldTheFloor on this, we have many battles to go, #StrongerTogether #resist
Hope to see you both @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein speaking all night as well. Beat the record. OR #HoldTheFloor just talk? Just asking!
Thank you Senator Merkley! Another Dem hero #holdthefloor
Can't believe McConnell blocked Garland for a sitting president and expects cooperation for an inappropriate nominee now. Get real.
Slept through history class I see. Unfortunately this is partisan politics. Biden & Ds did the same 2 Bush nominee. Thank Reid 4 Nuc option
Please tell me what exactly don't you like about Gorsuch besides him not being a full blown Liberal?
#Calexit
This is the theft of a #SCOTUS seat. You should keep talking until they have to physically remove you. What GOP did was unconscionable.
@KamalaHarris thinks #Gorsuch isn't fit for SCOTUS, but she's fine w/ him on 10th circuit for OK, KS, NM, CO, WY, & UT. #fakeoutrage
Yes! Thank you to both of you & all the others who are speaking up & holding the floor. #Resistance
Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks Senator Merkley 4 ur outstanding stance  support with this filibuster.  Good job
Ty   so much!  #StayStrong #BeBrave  #Resist
Thank U senator Merkley. #resist
I hope to hear @SenKamalaHarris speak next.. California, represent 
Keep it going!  With you in spirit if not voice.
Yes, thank you for being a D bag
Hopefully you plan on doing more than tweeting your thanks. #standup #standwithhim #speakout
Thank you Senator Merkley for filibustering against Gorsuch tonight!!
I support you 100%.      Proud to be represented by YOU !
Thank you for representing the will of most Californians on this poor nomination!
How do you know? We don't have voter ID laws, so there's no scientific way to determine what the majority of Californians believe!
Thank you for doing this
The Reid rule will come into play. Shame you don't put the same effort in running a successful country. Joke
thank you so much, takes the scare down a level
I'm tired of @SenateDems fake outrage.  If #Gorsuch is so bad, you should call for his impeachment/removal from 10th circuit.
Let's fight a thousand battles at once. That way we can B certain 2 lose them all. #resist #gorsuch
Thank you, sir
Tuned in. He is killing it.
Thank you Senator!  #holdthefloor
Great talk on Citizens United and Jefferson's intent!
Thanks for standing up for us.
how are they standing up for us??? A stupid senator from California & stupid one from Oregon.
#holdthefloor
Who's going up next ?
I hope, @KamalaHarris (as one of my fine Sens from Cali) that you will be participating as well
