The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!
@realDonaldTrump I agree and if he doesn't sell his businesses he doesn't become president.
lol don't you wish too bad democrats have no political power to get it done
The American people (who chose HRC) will hold him and Republicans accountable.
they didn't choice Hillary she only won 20 states or 270 EV sorry you can't win only
The American people chose here. Large swathes of land chose Trump.
elected her
People selected her. States don't vote. Plus voter suppression changed vote count
this is a misconception please read article II of the constitution
that's making the huge assumption that there would be a positive net balance after liquidating.
Doesn't matter. He chose to run for President knowing what the rules are. He must show his tax returns & divest.
it's not that I disagree with you. It's that I suspect he's hosed:he probably can't afford to sell everything. @SenJeffMerkley
I understand. He probably is underwater. Too bad. It doesn't matter. He knew the rules and he's not above them.
@realDonaldTrump no one asked anyone to sell Halliburton.... I'm just saying
No one owned Haliburton who was President. You make no sense.
Cheney owned Haliburton stock while he was VP; they got billion$ in contracts
Owned the company dimwit. He is in violation of Emoluments Clause of Constitution.
good thing the media told us about it this time huh
@realDonaldTrump so now it's an issue of a president owning a business? Right remember Clinton and his businesses?
it's ok for democrats to do it! Had he been clinton they see nothing wrong
what are you and our other elected senators going to do to make this happen?
he is a democrat nothing they don't have the political power to get much of this done!  To blackmail the pres
@2lisa4 

Step 3 resign
I am so glad you have time to worry about Donald Trump since you are not overly concerned about the people of RURAL OREGON..
It only took half a minute to type that tweet mate. And he should be educated on laws for the president.
he should be working at least as hard for the people that HE represents-we have starving children here at home
I doubt taking a moment to address Trump diverted him from any pre planed efforts from him.
I haven't seen any pre planned efforts to address the needs of rural Oregon for a while now..
when I do.. then I will listen to what else he might have to say...
He's at it again! Blames everyone else 4 his stupidity! Figures you'll forget about businesses, and kids in administration?
Step 3: You realize you are unfit for office (I can hope can't I?) @suestroud
@realDonaldTrump better yet step down
You're right, it's pretty simple. Step 1: Turn over presidency to winner of popular vote.
@realDonaldTrump Divest.
Why didn't U do anythng 2 prevnt Killary frm takng donations frm foreign govts? Obama telling illegals 2 vote? Where were U?
Why didn't you fight for Clinton Foundation lies when Clinton was Sec of State- you are a hypocrit and a liar.
or stop this #RussianCoup and the installation of #Putinspuppet. This election should be nullified.
That @realDonaldTrump needs to sell properties is a lie; he sells the business via IPO and he's done
Step 1. Show taxes. That's it!
@ThomasB00001 Step 3: Release tax returns.
all due respect: you should be speaking loudly about Trump/Russia everyday and about nothing else. This is an emergency.
@realDonaldTrump You and your supporters are truly deplorable.
@nutcrackermom @realDonaldTrump blah blah blah Russia are you listening ? Donald is whining again
@SusanDanzig219 Trump didn't write that tweet. "Pertains" isn't in his limited vocabulary; and commas properly placed? C'mon
Thank you! It is that simple  @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump and having your deplorable "children" in a meeting with Tech Industry leaders is a joke. Blind trust #swamp
No one prior ever had any other priority other than the business of the country. Of course it is a big, complicated deal!
@Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump Is he aware the media has no control over that, but that actual laws do? What a snake.
Trump doesn't have to sell his business, he could just step down.
@SenJeffMerkley @Lee_in_Iowa
@realDonaldTrump Step 3: ??? Step 4: PROFIT!
or he could turn it down and go live with putin since he loves dictators so much
@realDonaldTrump he might have to accept the presidents salary after all is said and done after all
: He's setting up a family dynasty not an American Democratic Fed'l Gov't
@realDonaldTrump yet not a word about Kate
Trump plans to skim 10s of billions while in office. It's that simple
IDIOT
Step 1A show US your tax returns.
Actually he needs 2 be impeached 4 treason
SENATOR, ALL AMERICA IS WAITING FOR THE INDICTMENT. CONGRESS MUST STOP THIS MEGALOMANIAC FOOL NOW, NOT AFTER 1/20/17.
@KaivanShroff I'm confident F-Face-VonTrump a) did not think he'd win, b) did not know what he'd have to give up if he did.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats are in no position to make demands.
3. Get rid of children BEING AT meetings.But most of all get rid of Trump & RNC/GOPS FOR HACKING. TREASON @THE HIGHEST LEVEL
@Sashworks_com @realDonaldTrump. Or...he could step down and check himself into a psychiatric hospital.
Amazing that his obvious insanity hasn't gotten any attention. Unprecedentedly insane.
. It's gotten some, but to no avail.
@realDonaldTrump how about everyone on "capitol" hill get rid of your special interests #payForPlay
He can place all of his equity interests into an omnibus hedge fund and sell off interests. Done in a month
3. Cooperate fully and proactively with Russian hacking investigation.
thank you for sponsoring this bill! #proudtobeanOregonian
@tribelaw He blames everything on the media! Isn't this stuff in the Constitution? Others have divested on principal!
@tribelaw 
you ARE RIGHTEASY PEASY
A BLIND TRUST
step#3 resign so as to not allow your ego to demolish the GREATEST NATION THERE IS.
@realDonaldTrump divest. Not complicated!
I would add if you don't divest yourself,you cannot be President.
actually it's one step: do exactly what he said he'll do and leave the businesses to his children.
Praise the Lord! Please stop the tyrant President Elect Donald Trump and his family from getting in the White House please!
if business transactions are so simple, why don't you have businesses worth billions of dollars?
@realDonaldTrump America above your interests, Trump. This is what you came for. Release tax returns and divest.
why don't we look at all the net worth of every politician before they went in office?.then and now
so only politicians can make money off being in office not the other way around corrupt senators
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump 3. A blind trust is not run by your sons.
@ElizabethRowin @SenJeffMerkley @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump maybe if they have their own email server
I 
make 
Deals

D. Trump
With
The
Devil
@realDonaldTrump How about just following the law. Oh that's right you believe yourself to be above it. #notmypresident
@chrisjzullo Caution: You May Get A Nasty 3am Tweet. #Divest
You're saying he shouldn't speak out against the president for fear of losing his elected job? Very dystopian
That's what it keeps coming out to. There would be riots if Obama tried pulling half of Trump's crap.
Totally support this. Thank you
it's really simple, hold HRC accountable, then come back and talk.....how's that sound??
@realDonaldTrump also, the ones who don't want u, are the ones who fear what u will do to corruption.. make a list don..
Why is news media NOT talking about  Secretary of State Kris Kobach and CROSS CHECK? You need new leadership!
He obviously knows and trusts a bunch of Goldman people who can do it for him
A true blind trust overseen by a nuetral party not kids- and how about he release his taxes too
@realDonaldTrump he really thinks he's fooling us! More people voted against him
What if he's under water? Needs branded hotel money to support rest of empire. No brand, no money, BK here we come. Again.
Thank you, Senator Merkley, for not being afraid to speak out!
