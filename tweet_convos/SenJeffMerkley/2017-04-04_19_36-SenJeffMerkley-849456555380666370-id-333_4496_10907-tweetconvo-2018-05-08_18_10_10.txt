awesome move... but with turtleman having filed cloture will it make a difference?
It doesn't look like it @67donnalynn Republicans are using the (nuclear option) 2 change law n the favor
i know.  i heard.  sad sad day for America... i cant even call my country by it's full name bc i we are the furthest from "United" 
It's crazy! But they already founda way 2 blame the Democrats B4. U know, to cover their *as!
NO Scotus vote with FBI investigation still going on!!!  How can this even be happening anyways?  like, isnt there a law or something???
When it comes to republicans, laws and rules don't apply. Are you as fed up as I am?
yes.  i'm fed up and i hope those Dems talk all night and until they kick gorsuch to the curb!!!  he's not fit to be lifelong scotus!
Yes! Couldn't agree more!
Money is all they listen to. If 45 is still president on May 1st I say we walk off jobs & shut down their economy to march on Washington.
Please do. I'll be sitting on the curb laughing as you get arrested.
What on earth is arrestable about walking? Was Forrest Gump not on the syllabus for your "How to Sound American" class, troll?
That's my senator!
I would honestly consider moving to your district. I live in NC, where everyone's a Republican except for our new Governor @RoyCooperNC
I'm thinking of moving too! Being in a deep red state is getting depressing
I grew up in Utah, so I know the pain.
I grew up in New York and moved to the heartland. I've never really felt like I belonged. I'm starting to understand why now
He's my senator... so proud of him! #NoStolenSearForGorsuch
Mine as well. Loving it.
And mine! I never tire of repeating it. We are so lucky.
Oregon is lucky to have all the great , hard working reps, with the exception of Walden. Walden really but it on trumpcare. SAD.
Walden is the one sad turd that, it seems, must mess up an otherwise perfect punch bowl.
Talk all night about how these 12 Dems supported #Gorsuch as a Judge in 2006.
List of #Democrats Who Confirmed #NeilGorsuch to Judgeship in 2006. 

NOW it's problem bc #Trump nominated 2 #SCOTUS? 
Have you read any of #NeilGorsuch's cases lately? Please start with the #TransAm case.
.#Gorsuch has heard some 3,000 cases, has a bio that would embarrass most ppl's bios http://courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gorsuch-QUESTIONAIRE.pdf â€¦ & u r whining about 1 case?
Not whining. I suggested that you START with the TransAm case. Firing a frozen driver, refusing treatment
I was impressed, listening to him speak. Then, I noticed his pattern of upholding businesses and not individuals.
Hmm. Thought businesses were made up of individuals?
Like #HobbyLobby.
Bless him for getting this read into the record for the benefit of future generations
Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed. This idiot losing his voice is just the first benefit.
Props to @SenJeffMerkley 
"Mr. Merkley Goes to Washington" ...  Get 'em Jeff!
@SenJeffMerkley is the voice of Democracy speaking. He is not alone. #holdthefloor
I'll only give him my support after it works.
Waste of crying dem time.. He will be confirmed and thank God our constitution will be legally upheld. MAGA
Rockstar!
Amen.republicans didn't object to Merrick Garland based on his record! They objected because they wanted 2 stack the court with conservativs
America needs a total political house cleaning, yes?
So? If we were playing by the exact same rules, you wouldn't have even posted this.
I just hope and pray that we can end this terrible terrible plague of deceit and cancerous turmoil that we have going on in the WH --SOON 
God love him   Lotsa coffee.
Republicans don't care about the constitution or courts. They care about their agenda, big business and their big money
Sometime send these guys coffee
I'll predict that attention-seeking Jeff Merkley will be very likely the NEXT Democrat US Senator to be thrown-out of office.
Bravo Senator Merkley!!
Let him have at it
I don't care who you are......you gotta appreciate a man who can go *all night* lol

#HoldtheFloor
This is what a champion looks like.
POS!
You seem really triggered right now, Richard.
Yep, love my Glocks--but can't stand totalitarian liberals!

Yep!
What a Boss. No bathroom breaks though. I hope he consulted the Catheter Cowboy. He's down for the cause.
Real strengthen use the tools God give u to fights injustice!!!!!
Just curious, do they wear diaper during filibuster? 
Yes!
Way to go @SenJeffMerkley I feel you are the right person for this job.
He's an idiot and will be gone 2018
STAND STRONG DEMOCRATS!!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley !! Keep holding their feet to the fire!
Can they hold till Russian investigation is through?
And as usual cowardly @SenMcCain despite contrary lip service will support nuclear option. Party over country!
I just wanted want to be a fly in the room lol
Jeff Merkley Proud of your outstanding dedication...(Can he be cloned for a total of 7 Senate seats?)
I'm so proud of our Senators fighting regardless of what the outcome is there fighting and it's appreciated
@PanacomHumayun
Another hypocrite. He can act foolish in front of camera, that won't change the outcome. He might just need a timeout.
He was great, politely tore apart errant decisions by Gorsuch, made a fan of me.
POS!
Time for the nuclear option.
No one will mention Judge Gorsuch's ruling on the medical/religious use of marijuana. He turned his back on 6,000yrs of history and Science.
We're with you, .@SenJeffMerkley !! Thanks
THANK YOU JEFF MERKLEY FOR STANDING G UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT
God's Blessings on you!!
Yesssssssssssss
Thank you!
What a guy! Went on for more than 15 hours.
He's my Senator!
And I voted a straight Dem ticket....and all I got was Faux-Dem Joe Donnelley!
You have my sympathy. I have 2 good Senators & OR has 4 good Reps, the 5th one is an embarrassment  (he's not mine)
The only thing 'stole' was IQ points,
about 50 per Senator.
It's contagious, and I reckon it got you too.
There is one valid nominee. Garland. @kylegriffin1 @MSNBC
It's just bull crap that these lunatics were allowed to steal that Supreme Court position!
Go Merkley Go!
If sen merkley had an intelligence contest with gorsuch he would come out looking like a moron!! Doesn't do a bad job of thAt on his own
Good, let him stand like a fool.  Shortly thereafter, Gorsuch will be a SCOTUS justice.
a lot of things in our system need to be fixed. LOTS, the Supreme Court is one. Y do they get a job for life? Terms?
Who is sending donuts & coffee this morning?
Now he is a leader! He is a patriot Wouldn't it be great if the GOP had even 1 of him? Spoiler alert they don't! @SenJeffMerkley @SenateGOP
I think a vote should be done so the American people can choose between Judge Garland & Judge Gorsuch, & GOP should not force a judge on [US
@leftistideas @MSNBC Such sincere caring, people's champion.  Bravo Sen Merkeley! Amazing fortitude!
And the GOP did not hear a single word you said and will never change their minds. they don't like something they change the rules.
I know he believes what he's doing but their going to go nuclear so in the end it's not going to matter....GOP are cheaters!!
Hang in there Senator @SenJeffMerkley ! You can do this! Keep up the good fight! We are proud of you!!
bravo 
It would be totally awesome if he read Dr. Seuss to Cruz's kids for a bedtime story.
BRAVO! Thank you @SenJeffMerkley
Garland could NOT get 51 votes for confirmation. The Senate effectively voted Garland down.
He's weak he'll barely make it 16 hours, Rand Paul can go a full 24 on the 4th amendment.
Love him
Thank you Sen Jeff Merkley #StopGorsuch
I'm so glad for our Democrats keepin this country together.If it wasn't for them Putin would be in total controlGOD I thank you for the dems
Judge For such IS going to be on the #SCOTUS Get used to it! @MSNBC
I support Sen. Merkley's clear assessment of the GOP senate. Steal Supreme seat/pack the court. Following authoritarian playbook. RESIST!!
Just saw Jeff LIE on the Floor of the Senate about the "60 Vote Standard for Justices"There have been Many Justices been voted in w/ 51-59!
So if Gorsuch was a transgender,illegal,Muslim confused about which bathroom he should use dems would jump for joy.
Republican right wing backed by Koch Brothers are working diligently changing our constitution permanently why is no one talking about it?
Thank you
Hust doing it for limelight and votes. Grandstanding.
Thats leadership trump.
Good on you senator Merkley thank you

#holdthefloor #HERO
Serious question:
Do they wear makeup for these special performances?
A politician that is working by right and wrong not by party. People like that are American Hero s.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley !
Thank you, Senator Merkley. So glad I introduced many students to you over your last terms. I support you!
Thank you Jeff!
Heroic and right thing to do.
And he did; been going over 12 hours now #holdthefloor
@AltUSPressSec @MSNBC
Nothing stolen once O lost the senate. Just rude.
Agreed!  No SCOTUS vote while Trump's being investigated!  Sen Merkley & Dems have my support. #NoToGorsuch #RESISTANCE #NoBanNoWallNoRaids
Thank you Senator!!! You are saving our country and i couldn't appreciate it more 
Everything he discusses now becomes a permanent public record blasting abuses of the GOP congress!
he will be confirmed by Friday thanks to harry reid
@mattmanaz @MSNBC Best worded rebuttal from Dems I've heard yet. Why haven't they been yelling this the whole time? #SCOTUS
He will be a name to remember for years to come and will go down in history as a person who stood his ground and make people accountable.
@bannerite @MSNBC  President Merkley?
A good man will defend what is right even when faced with angry opponents.
this is why Mitch McConnell needs to go. A stolen seat. Republicans have lost so much integrity & don't care who knows
Wonderful!
Remember all the years  Republicans harped about Biden 'borrowing'  words from Kinnock? Not a word about slimey Gorsuch

@SenJeffMerkley thank you for your service.    @SenJohnMcCain
You go, Senator Merkley! Geaux Oregon!!
poor guy! He is embarrassing. We will remember how u played games instead of working for our state. #voteGorsuch
This is quite admirable but we r dealing with the most corrupt WH admin & GOP in American history They r traitors to country & forefathers
Love from back home in OR @SenJeffMerkley! Drink H20 & don't let @GOP & #Gorsuch forget: Thou shalt not steal (incl SCOTUSseat & plagiarism)
Go the distance!
Proud to be a next door neighbor to this Senator. Seattle is behind him all the way. Fight the good fight! #RESISTANCE
Is it allowed to read books to the Senate? Perhaps the dem can teach the republicans something :')
Phony Garland outrage.
Go Sen.Merkley. This was Garlands seat. #potus is a fraud, #gorsuch is a stool pigeon for corporations.
A true American patriot
@SenJeffMerkley Bravo!!! Thank you for the all night #Filibuster!!! #NoGorsuch
I'm in Portland and we are proud of Merkley. He's our man!
@AltFedEmployee @MSNBC Dang! That's a lot of talking! Hope he's stocked up on water & lozenges. Is there a live feed online?
I'm with Merkley 
Don't you just love this man for his dedication?! I do!!
Thank you for doing your job
I will have "crocodile tears" for you guys, you poor abused Demogods!
Nuclear option.
Too bad @HillaryClinton  is no longer Senate. She sat through bullshit for 11 hours...I know she would fillibuster like a boss....
Too much focus on the fact that he's holding the floor. Not enough focus on the extremely wise things he's been saying all night.
Go brother
Til Thursday??? And then what???
BFD
@orangepussygrab @realDonaldTrump @SenMajLeader - GOOD for him.
Rocking the david letterman late night power tie. He didn't come to f around. 

*applause sign blinks*
In case you've lost faith in the future of humanity, I remind you now that is the children who will lead us.
I made my 7yo watch for 6 whole minutes while I explained what was happening. Her comment? "Next time they should wear grown-up diapers." 
Sen Merkley is a Rep doing more then some of the over paid Rep in office. Gorsuch is scum Merkley doing his job! Unlike other Rep Senators!
@ShebaRiddle5 @MSNBC THANK YOU, @SenJeffMerkley!
3 Dems voting for #Gorsuch: @Sen_JoeManchin (WV), @SenatorHeitkamp (ND) & @SenDonnelly (IN). Shameful!  #GorsuchHearing
Love my Senator. #holdthefloor.
My Senator Jeff Merkley is ALL IN on his rightful opposition to Gorsuch nomination.  & YES, Coree; all other Democrats stand with him. ALL
This makes me so happy to have voted for him. Way to go @SenJeffMerkley
So proud of my senator right now!  YES!
@SenJeffMerkley thank you Senator!
Ok then
Wish I could bring him a Starbucks and a cookie .
Love Jeff Merkley, glad he's my Senator!
LOL, I was watching the beginning and then I said, "I don't think he is going to stop!". Fucking crazy
SO MUCH RESPECT FOR @SenJeffMerkley THANK YOU FROM THIS AMERICAN!!!
Cali, OreGONE and Washington states should form their own country.  Bunch of wackos
Go Joe Go!
He's pretty amazing, what endurance....!
Haul ass senator!
My wife is an insomniac. I'll suggest she turn on C-Span for this riveting oratory. They could bottle it for a cure
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT Jeff!
Oregon loves Merkley
Still here with you @SenJeffMerkley #TheResistance believes in you! #RESIST against GOPs they are NOT what America stands for!
Good man
It's time people ACTUALLY filibuster
It's refreshing to see Dems actually fight
Liberals Dems #resist it's time to support @SenJeffMerkley  It's always been about the Court.
would be the last of the branches to fall.
Worse than that... How can a Senator who is under Federal indictment vote?
Omg I love this man!!

When filibustering only one person holds the floor.
Good for Jeff Merkley!!!
Give them hell
thank you @SenJeffMerkley
Right On Brother, Right On!
#ThankYou for having our backs!
Yes! Thank you, Senator Merkley! #holdthefloor #AllNightLong
My Senator- so proud of my vote!
Yay!
Yes!!! Thank you Senator!
My senator and proud of him!
Oregon has given us a hell of a great man...
Way to go!!!!#resist #impeachTrump
Now THAT'S being a public servant! Thank you @SenJeffMerkley 

Poor bastard has been trying to make a name for himself for years.  Just can't get out from under his stepdad Wyden.
Read the plagiarized stuff!
