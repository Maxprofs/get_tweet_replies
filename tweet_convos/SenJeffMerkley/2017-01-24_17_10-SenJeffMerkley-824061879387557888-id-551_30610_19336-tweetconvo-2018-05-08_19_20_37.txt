Most right wingers don't believe there was a 650,000 years ago...
Many care about their own 1A and 2A rights, but don't care about anyone else's.
yes to you! @SenJeffMerkley
would b diff if press sec had an expln.tweets are efficient way to get info to the public Fires, avalanche, road probs.Dumb!
thank you for fighting the good fight. From a fan in MD.
this isn't us as Americans! Please demand this STOP! people with visas and green cards in hand should not be stopped
Please cite (reputable sources only) documentation of President Obama ever having done something similar to this.
I stand corrected.  Might I suggest you spend some more time reading their information.  They seem legit.
I railed against some of Obama's as well.  Specifically because I feared a President Palin - never dreamed of this.
I'd be much less worried if his cabinet nominations were remotely qualified for their positions.
$4 Billion per day wasted on this delusional portrayal of man's ability to control nature. Climate Fraud!
Thought Obama took care of the climate. Wow!!
@johnlegend hard to believe there were scientists 650,000 years ago. Learn something new everyday I guess.
Senator, how can any POTUS have this kind of power? Aren't there limits & fail safes in place?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! ...oh I'm sorry. You were serious. Short answer is No. Welcome to Trumperica.
Reporting factual information to the public through a media that reaches millions is not playing. It's informing.
Hard to deny when you can't see the sky.   Or Breathe.
@NaomiOreskes makes sense as I believe there are a lot more ants in the world today as well
ah maybe because no trees carbon different everywhere doesn't mean climate change #hoax
.
@AndyRichter How is it that he can delete tweets paid for by American taxpayers?
I am with you!!!
@WarrenCliisaac @potus this make you better President Trump

I'm starting a movement #NotInMyName
#ImpeachCorrumpt
thanks for standing up for scientific integrity! You and those like you are awesome.
And now it gets even worse since Trump is taking our funding for clean water & air. Have we lost all our rights?
Thank you!
@ChelseaClinton Chelsea, Shouldn't you be spending as much time as you can with your corrupt mother before she goes to jail?
Make IRS stop "audit" #TrumpTaxes. Pass GOP-friendly law > no rich person can be audited over 1yr. @SenWarren  @SenSanders @SenJeffMerkley
Thanks for standing fast in support of science! Proud you are my Senator. #resist

Please vote No on Sessions!
Thank you for your leadership on this topic Senator. This is censorship; retweeting yours, but that will not be enough. Please take action.
@SenSchumer
keep fighting the good fight Senator. Those of us Americans overseas are trying to show what #RealAmericans stand for.
Way to go, Sen. Merkley!
is it illegal to delete piblic records?
hey did you see this? http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/voice-america-has-concerns-about-team-trumps-takeover …
GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE he is #delusional and wrecking our country
"The main reason for exhalation is to rid the body of carbon dioxide". Shall we kill off population?
thanks for retweet!
@LegendofWelda "facts"
data is data
right.
The statements are true. Their implications may not be.
so they're facts. How you interpret them is up to you.
yes, they are technically correct.
Much like it's true the earth is actually cold  :)
it's sure fuckin cold outside right now that's for sure
kek
Implementation of the stimulus package....
Federal officials were ordered not to talk with the media due during the Obama administration “increased scrutiny surrounding”
Did the world burn up 650,000 years ago and I missed it?
Is this Russia or the USA? Impeach trump before he starts killing people. I think he is capable & he plans to in N Dakota.
thank you
It is the Bison farts!
Badlands National Park is Bad-Ass! Good job, whoever you are!
Is there any proof that Trump is responsible? Asking for a friend. @lyssophobe
.@SenJeffMerkley You're missing the 3rd deleted tweet (perhaps I'm missing 4 through 10?): https://twitter.com/SJB_in_NDG/status/824411545182601216 …
@chickilopiccolo There goers any type of transparency Back 2 hiding activities that will hurt We the ppl. #TheResistance
thank you, Senator. Keep up the hard work. We need more of you!
...you lie!
@AndyRichter we have been keeping track of co2 levels for 650,000 years?
Aren't these part of the public record and therefore cannot be scrubbed?
I have to say, I don't understand his reasoning behind gagging the facts
Check out @AltNatParkSer
@PaulGosser ghjk
@PaulGosser That is Carbon Dioxide is not bad. Trees and plants need it. Also humans have not been on earth for a millionYrs
Already retweeted the original. Not surprised it was deleted.  Kremlin taking over! #RESISTANCE 
@BumblebeeNebula science?!? you've been monitoring levels for longer than humans have been on the planet? that's not science
are we still crying let's give him a chance
@Mabukon keep these facts alive
whacha gonna do bout it? asap!!!
Your "climate facts" leave out real science and instead use political propaganda. So....good for Trump.
Thank you and we stand behind you!
is pushing #alternativefacts - they said a rogue former employee did it & they took action to delete hacked tweets.
well, we have some #roguerangers from @AltNatParkSer working hard to keep the word out! Let's help spread the word!
@jmuhj1  These only refer to carbon dioxide,which is a definite&measurable quantity.It does not speculate on warming.@POTUS
"Climate facts". Sounds like "settled science". Newton and Einstein are rolling over in their graves because of you guys
for Christ sake people
This is something @NicolasMaduro would do in his country... Does our @POTUS share his way of governing? @SMShow @CNN @AP
And it's 405.25 PPM now, as of the last reading. #sigh
National Park Service Tweets @AltNatParkSer - if you follow, unfollow the other one, they want this on the DL
after being shut down and removing the tweets they have started a new account: @AltNatParkSer
So we need to genetically modify more sea life to convert it to food.  FREE FOOD!  We need more Co2!
seems unconstitutional to censor them.
I think all this is a bad joke and I'm waiting on Ashton kutcher to jump out and scream, " punked"
This is a regime, not admin 
Can you say Dictator in the house?    #Resistance
Bullshit! That was an unauthorized use of a government twitter account. Violating department policy.
New ones...
I have made full copy of the entire website including files and links
#nocensorship!
CNN http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/politics/badlands-tweets-climate-change/index.html …  The Park stated that it was deleted of their own volition since was an ex employee
No matter your position on climate change, this level of executive interference is disturbing.
thank you for standing up for us.
Also I encourage everyone to make free accounts on http://internetarchive.org  and archive everything you read moving forward.
so you know.. it would be really nice too if we could hear from the other scientists that Obama had HUSHED UP!
that then puts all of this in the category of man made bla bla bla. God also said HE alone will destroy the earth NOT MAN!
far beyond what we know it to be. God tells us the earth was created along with the Heavens.. approx 6000 years ago..
Let me remind you what we were told before.
none of those are true. It is based on science that assumes the age of the earth is FAR beyond what we know it
speaking of gag orders...
@dbzell  CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT PRIORITY ALL $ ON PLANET WON'T HELP .RIGGED HER VOTES STOLE  PRESIDENCY TREASON CORRUPTION.
I just went to look back at that accounts and they still have several tweets about climate change 
im going to guess that was before Trump's presidency. He put a gag order on EPA + USDA. https://www.google.com/amp/amp.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2017/01/25/trump_issues_gag_orders_on_science_agencies.html?client=safari …

global warming is real can't believe we do anything for a vote and a  dollar
Thank you!
You guys should be investigated for political fakery and fraud against the American people...
I agree with @realDonaldTrump .  Global warming is junk science.  God created earth and all that is therein.
Follow @AltNatParkSer, a feed some heroic nartional parks employees have set up. 1st front in #Resistance
@SenSchumer Please oppose this!!
Thanks.
new Admin didn't delete those tweets. Badlands twitter was accessed by an ex-employee who was unauthorized to speak on their behalf. #facts
I believe in science and especially communication to the public. Please help to remove the gag order on @EPA and USDA-ARS!
@SheWhoVotes the govt is not trumps personal domain. The agencies have wk to do. Truth is first on agenda.
@SheWhoVotes you Senator and your Democratic and Independent colleagues need to start fighting back b4 it's too late!
I'm pretty sure the embarrassing dead animal on drumpfs head would not be possible if not for climate change maybe that explains the spite
@0rdellRobbie 
There is a lesson here. For me, that lesson is once you say something, those words can never die.
Pass this on ...
thank you
Isn't this a First Amendment violation?
@SenSchumer if u have been to the @BadlandsNPS u really think it matters. Why it's called the badlands.
CNN changes fake news story about crowd size! http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/crowd-size-matters-trump-is-right-it-was-huge/ …
watching u on cable yesterday showed how childish you and the DEMS are. You wonder why you lost! People tired of Washington
Thank you.
We will FIGHT but will YOU, SIr & Dems in Congress? 
UNANIMOUS approvals of UNQUALIFIED #SwampCabinet?
Where is your #resistance #courage ?
Thank you Sue! @SenJeffMerkley
Why is Badlands NP tweeting about climate change? Violates 1939 Hatch Act per Obama's OSC rules. https://osc.gov/Resources/Social%20Media%20HA%20Handout.pdf …
@LikusPJ Didn't @realDonaldTrump go after @HillaryClinton for deleting things? Now he's ordering federal agencies to delete?
check out @AltNatParkSer
@SenSchumer there is no climate change just the sun
@twistedparent 

TRUMP:

@ezlusztig Yes I do. He must be stopped from damaging our planet.
@SenSchumer Why did you vote to confirm Pompeo, known pro torture ass.  Guest of Frank Gaffney.   He's worse than DT!

@SenSchumer You lost shut up
@JuddApatow #censorship #dangeroustimes

@NormEisen Time for @altBadlandsNAtionalParkServicr
Check out @AltNatParkSer The Unofficial "Resistance" team of U.S. National Park Service.
@BadlandsNPS come on guys
being charitable, say the new admin. is "finding its feet", being more critical, they r authoritarian fascists
Wonder why they are so mild and meek? That's been Dem's prob for years. Since DT plays rough, WE MUST TOO!
thank you, senator!
Jeff's & EPA's "Alternative Facts" on CO2 Highest NOW? Stop the Fake News Senator!
@billbarnwell stick to football, please.
nope
How does this not violate the 1st Amendment? I am also worried for the 4 journalists that were arrested.
What is this tyrant trying to do ? What  har about the EPA scary. Please stand strong
Things are getting scary.
@billbarnwell next we'll get the parks view on abortion gay marriage and gun control!
republicans are pure evil
Dear @SenJeffMerkley 
Will you stand w/ us? Will you promise to filibuster EVERYTHING? Will you #DemandGarland as we do?

@hotelkeys
@AnyShaps try @AltNatParkSer
Trump thinks he knows more than all the scientists! What a fool. He doesn't care about maintaining fresh air and water.
where are the Republican senators?
Good for you. Now get out and organize your Dem co-workers to stop his madness!
