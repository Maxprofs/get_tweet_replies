Keep fighting for us! We've got your back.
Thank you, Sen. Merkley.
#pollutingPruitt is a nice hashtag. And Senator, thank you for your questions.
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley for your service during these ridiculous times.
we have no facts that global warming is cause by people. Inuit Indians noted the earth has tilted 20 degrees, that's why!
This was a beautiful take down Senator, thank you. Keep fighting for the American people.
omg you tried to vote our rights away with the UN now you cry wolf
keep holding out for truth and transparency!
Wow. We must see those emails. Reject #PollutingPruitt
Challenge @jiminhofe to find a snowball in Washington DC in this winter without snow. It's #climatechange #RejectPruitt
Your total lack of objectivity makes you unfit to lead.  RESIGN!!!!!!!...or you're FIRED!!!
@JuddApatow Thank you Sen. Oregon is so proud of you! Keep fighting for us and the country.
#Impeach45
, are those e-mails going to be released to you? If it's found out to be that he did something illegal what happens to him?
Thank you.

This is a real issue, and Oregonians voted him in to take stands like these.  Find a safe space in a red state.
Just wondering.  Is PDX the drug they feed you to keep you zombified and following the globalists?
Sounds like you REALLY need to move to a safe space.
Don't worry zombie clown.  I'll be safe!  They haven't castrated all of us yet!
You seem to think "zombie" is clever enough to use in every other tweet. It isn't. Get creative.
Infuriating. 
Wake up @GOP & &RealDonaldTrump, there is NO PLANET B!!
#TheResistance #Resist #NotMyPresident
thank you for being one of the few still towing the line for working families. Ignore the trolls.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for demanding to see whats in those emails. Clean air is human right. #pollutingPruitt
nicely done JEFF
@Earthjustice Thank you Senator.  He represents profits for himself & rich elite. He can't be givin this position.
Disgusting behavior by future EPA administrator.  Disgusting.  @SenJeffMerkley @OEVAorg
Go Jeff!!!
nice job Jeff
Thank you for fighting for us.
#ThanksJeff Thank you for speaking on behalf of Oregonians.
don't confirm him.
GREAT JOB! we stand with you in the fight against these Charlatans put up by DJT!
We KNOW that if it were Santa Clause himself, the libbotard world would be up in arms.  Go away.  It's OUR turn now!!
Great job Senator! So proud to have you as my Senator. We need 99 more like you. Holding these people accountable!!
so tired of the childish name calling. You should do your job w/o this & be professional.
thank you for your tireless work on our behalf.  We need more voices like yours. Maybe 1 day fellow Repubs will b as brave
well done Senator. You should have picked up your  and dropped it at the end. Excellent work.
Thank you We lived in WVA. Natural gas drilling tainted the ground water for a 50 Sq mile area. We boiled tap water to drink
Senator Merkley, do you represent the interests of America & The State of Oregon, or just the LEFT-WING Liberal arm of  #DNC
Why do you oppose a strong self-sufficient economy?
Thanks for telling #pollutingPruitt what's what!
Jeff you're a phony stop line in your pockets
You talk crap about others, but do little. Just do your job and leave the party talking points behind. That is if you can.
should've figured Obamas behind you you're his puppet
all you Democrats think you're funny you're going to pay at the polls laugh at that one
about as mych as criminal merkley
thank you for your vigilant efforts. Please fight for the people and our precious environment.
Man made Climate change is hoax perpetrated by #regressiveLeft to tax citizens to death, a conduit for CONTROL.
@SenateDems better then taking some politicians at their word.
if I could tweet this again, I would. You're our hero Senator, thank you for fighting the good fight #noonpruitt
making this Oregonian proud #merkley2020
Pruitt knows nothing of working to produce anything Good. Only what helps Oil, Koch Brothers and his friends. BAD BAD 
@SenateDems Hahahahaha. Someone got caught in a big whopper. Every single person in this admin LIES.
Thank you for your integrity and service to Americans!!
Go get 'em Senator!!!
@SenateDems should keep your eyes on both Pruitt & Tillerson as they help roll back regs to limit oil drilling & pipelines!
it sounds to me like Pruitt just said the residents of Oklahoma don't matter but the corporations therein do.
@AGScottPruitt Let's find out! Seems this administration has nothing but secrets. #CongressCanRequest #PressOn
@SenateDems maybe his name should be  Oily P
Hypocrite, I didn't hear you once ask what Hillary was hiding in thousands of destroyed emails. Partisan & #StupidOnPurpose
It's always about her emails with you people. Your boy won. He's accountable now. Deal with it
sent letters b Becky Bladerson a sped teacher b a junkie in plainclothes working next to her! Saw stash @DEAHQ Â©
@SierraClub Thank YOU Senator!
Thank you, Senator. Your work is appreciated--@AGScottPruitt would be a catastrophic choice to head @EPA. #RejectPruitt
@SierraClub Well done, Senator. Thank you.
thank you
let's hook up #pollutingPruitt and #RexTillerson and send them to Russia. Let them destroy Putin's country!
We have to have people woth INTEGRITY whose interests are for clean air/water-NOT oil co's.
He must not be confirmed!
You're a hero! Thanks, Sen. Merkley.
Again, I disagreed with you many times in the past, but I find myself on your side more and more every day.
THE ONLY EMAIL SCANDAL WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IS HILLARY CLINTONS. WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THAT ENOUGH YET
thank you for putting Pruitt on the hot seat...he is sooooooo bad for our environment..
@SierraClub Why choose someone who seem not interested in improving environmental quality?
Thank you for this.
well done Senator!  I appreciate your ability not to let the lies stand, challenging his answers based on the FACTS! #RESIST
Can Senate subpoena the emails??
