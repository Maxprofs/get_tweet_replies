Love you Sen. Merkley!
They never quit do they. #SaveACA
Once again career politicians don't understand if they don't repeal and replace ACA they will be replaced by American voters who will do it
We'll do the opposite. Democrats will repeal and replace republicans for their neglect and traitorous behaviour. Roll on 2018 #ITMFA
Lmao, just like Hillary was gonna be president and Obama wasn't wiretapping Trump. You may wanna see a therapist to help with ur delusions
DoJ report confirms Obama DID NOT wiretap Trump.

Exactly
The only ones being "ripped away" are the unborn in your state due to the bill signed by the gov sanctioning genocide.
TRAITORS THIEVES TAX us unfairly & unnecessarily give nothing pay WILL SPEND REST OF MY LIFE REMOVING ALL.
@SenateMajLdr @SenJohnMcCain @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @KamalaHarris
CONSIDER THIS- it might be impossible to disprove that ANY CONDITION wasn't to some extent "pre-existing"  WHAT A VILE CON  #impeachtrumpnow
THANK YOU!!!
Thank you for your tireless fight, not just for your constituents, but all Americans.
Press needs to put GOP senators in hot seat. "So you are PRO-no coverage for Americans with pre existing conditions?" Make them defend this
Someone made a comment.if GOP is pro life, why are they trying to take lives of millions by cutting medical care? But we can buy more bombs?
Anti Choice not Pro Life
True but argument for being anti-choice is that the unborn life is sacred.....it would follow that all life is sacred.....or should be.
They don't want women to have a choice at all is my point. The life isn't sacred. It's the act of denying the choice that is sacred.
That is true.Must be the choice that is the issue. Women are entitled to make their own choice & that should be regardless of others. Thanks
They promised better healthcare -not 2 rip millions OFF healthcare! GOP have lied, we're done with it.
And, once again, there will be no "ripping away". Many will CHOOSE to not carry health insurance. That's their right.
Many will not be able to afford coverage - that isn't a 'choice' it's manslaughter.
Affordable? Many can't afford premiums-must pay a fine. No coverage but money out of pocket...manslaughter? Avg mo. premium=$1021 Ded=$8,352
THANKYOU
Just can't give up that power to the states can u senator. Must be difficult to be that power hungry.

Thank you, sir, for standing for women, the elderly, and all Americans. OR  YOU!!!
This guy is it. #RightonJeff
Americans are literally pleading for theirs and their children's lives but the GOP can piss away 700 billion to the military. We are failing
Pissing away on the military?  Have you noticed that (a) China &Russia don't like us & (b) they're rapidly expanding theirs
The GOP doesn't have money for our own people who are sick. Seven hundred billion dollars?
It is an $80B increase, after years of sequestration to point that huge numbers of planes had to be cannibalized to keep the other flying
It's also 83 billion dollars over the budget cap. Even Corker voted against that.
This needs to be the LARGEST stand because now Koch brothers threatening to cut donation funding to @GOP 
Money speaks 2 GOP #GrahamCassidy
The Republicans could never rip as much insurance away from Americans as you did passing the ACA.
More Merkley Merdre.  BS.
You gotta hand it to the cons, they never give up...unlike the democrats
Thanks for working for us Senator! Keep it up. We are depending on you!
Thanks for continuing to fight, Senator!
Everyone needs to keep retweeting the ways to text senators and call them.
Thank you for fighting Senator!
ThankYou @SenJeffMerkley 
Under Berniecare, 180 million will lose their private health insurance. But I'm sure you're for that.
1) Millions would leave of their own choice. No mandate. 2) What about the 7 million who lost their private policies under Obamacare???
Naw, just trying to fix the mess the donkey party created
Its cute how you never get tired of being perpetually wrong....
Thank you, Sen. Merkley!
If it cums out of your mouth you lying
When GOP backers realize the tax cuts weren't for them, AND they still can't afford healthcare, remember, they are all fully armed
Stay on your feet Jeff
#SaveLives   #SaveACA
Ppl would take you more seriously if you didn't didn't make such silly claims about political opponents and quit using the word diabolical.
@ElinHege GOP Senators NowOften. Protest this bill that will leave fellow Americans to die of pre exciting conditions
Thank you for all you do.  The GOP must hate poor and middle class as much as they love the Kochs.
ACA is imploding and millions more will lose coverage and what you are protecting is all those hidden taxes.
#18Voter Civil War to flip Congress of all rhino's who don't put America 1st,Total Repeal/Replace,TaxReform,Wall build,&18 budget by 1Oct17
Why do you think Calie and Vermont said no too single payer Jeffie ? Could it have been it couldn't be payed for?
Please find a different adjective. There are no devils (and no gods).
#RepealObamacare
And bring the U.S. too complete bankruptcy giving Bernie Care too any citizen/illegal living here ??
Thank you Sen Merkley for protecting our right to healthcare
Keep it up Senator Merkley Oregon is with you!! Thank you for being there for us!!
Referring to a diabolical scheme..#Obamacare
Yes we remember how dems pushed it on the middle class
without 1 republican vote.
How's it feel
Thank you so very much Senator Merkley for working so hard saving The Affordable Care Act. I'm so honored to be one of your constituents 
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for fighting to protect our healthcare. Stop #GrahamCassidyBill
not trust @OregonGovBrown to distribute grant $?  Already 40% inelligible  taxing those who have ins, unlimited abortions..waste, murder ..
Absolutely! The bill allows the wealthy to actually get dough... yes that's right. Tax cuts for the wealthy. Not kidding. This is SICK AF
And you don't pay into a retirement account ?? HCSA are for every tax bracket !

Diabolical Scheme!!!!!
FYI-bill strips healthcare from 32 million people & eliminates ALL Medicaid by 2026 (which 1.7 million vets depend on) not just expansion.

Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley. I wish Senators @timkaine and @MarkWarner would stop defending corporate insurance cos & start helping Americans
Sen. Merkley, keep fighting the good fight on healthcare for all Americans. Don't let the Senate GOP pass tRumpcare-less 3.0. FIX OBAMACARE.
Thank you also for voting against the additional $700 billion to the military,  senator
Yes seconded!
Can you "third" something? If so, I'm doing it!
Be honest Jeff, you're NOT interested in healthcare, you demand funding for @PPact to murder babies:
GOP have heard Koch threat not to fund their re-election campaigns unless they deliver massive tax cut to wealthy via ACA destruction
