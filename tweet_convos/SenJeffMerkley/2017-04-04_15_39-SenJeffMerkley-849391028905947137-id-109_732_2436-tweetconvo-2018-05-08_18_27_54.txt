GORSUCH HAS A 97% CONFIRMATION RECORD, WHICH MEANS THE LEFT APPOINTED JUDGES AGREED WITH HIM 97% OF THE TIME! THIS IS A FACT.

@SenateDems - Go go go!!!
Can't wait to watch Judge Gorsuch get confirmed.
Thank you.
Great job, @SenJeffMerkley!
Give 'em hell, Senator!
Why will something new be said? Will you site constitution law? Or will you pander to emotion?
Watching now.#DarkMoney = Koch Brothers= Gorsuch. #Block Gorsuch!
We are a Republic and you sir are a sore loser and will be voted out and what's left of your criminal party
This will be your last term.
Watching. Thank you for standing up for true justice.
Thank you, Senator Merkley!
#GoingNuclear #SupremeCourtJusticeGorsuch #JustAMatterOfTime LOL!!
Sour grapes. Act like an adult. Do what's right for the people not what soothes your damaged pride.
Thank you
Don't string your lemmings along. Come Friday, there is nothing you or any Dem can do to stop Neil Gorsuch from becoming Justice Gorsuch
Thank you!! Illegitimate "president" does not get a SCOTUS nominee.
Go get'em Jeff!!
Thank you over and over again. #StopGorsuch
Thank you, sir, for serving We The People.
Keep going Jeff.

Thank you for fighting for us! We the people!
You go, Senator!!
Thank you for doing all you can to block this nominee.
YEA
This filibuster is one of the dumber stunts ever pulled. Now we'll get radical judges.
My family supports you  Senator Merkley. Stay strong and fight for us average Americans, against the corporate RATS like #Gorsuch!
THANK YOU!!!
THANK YOU for standing strong on this, Senator! #StopGorsuch
Gorsuch is a great judge...stop protesting and start working!
go to good sir!
Hey Staff! What's up?
Gorsuch received unanimous highest rating by the American Bar Association. Highly qualified jurist, perhaps the best Trump could nominate.
Democrats already did away w/ filibuster for everything else, saw what happened this year w/ Trump nominees. Nuclear option coming soon.
Obstruct. Filibuster. Block. At all costs. Do it. Time to fight fire with fire. Let chips fall. We know the stakes.
Foolish idea. Gorsuch was confirmed to Circuit w/ wide Dem support. Filibuster now and you can say good bye to re-election.
The fight is over. You lost. Didn't Schumer tell you. No? you must not matter
But you and your fellow Democrats voted to confirm him once before. What changed? The cold truck driver?
Good luck, you and the control freak demos are not going to succeed. Demo-turds
Wrong, Rick
No, I'm right turd or is it snowflake 
#StopGorsuch Do What you can. Appreciate your work
Please filibuster!
