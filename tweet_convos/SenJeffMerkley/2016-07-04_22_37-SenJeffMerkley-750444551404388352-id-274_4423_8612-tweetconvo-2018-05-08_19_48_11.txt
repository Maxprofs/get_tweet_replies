The spaccraft arrives into Jupiter's orbit at a velocity of 542 meters per second.  The insertion in Jupiter's orbit is a success.
There are 16898 individual solar cells giving Juno its energy to explore planet Jupiter.  There's more to come with the mission.
Impressive getting there. Really is. Now explain how the $1.1 Billion cost will benefit the US tax payers who funded this project
We'll learn also a lot more about the role these gigantic planets played in putting together the remaining of the Solar System.
congratulations. Your work is awesome. Out of this world to say the least.
You people at NASA are (and have always been) an amazing team......
The spacecraft will also observe Jupiter's auroras.  Juno will help to learn much more about the giant gas planets formation.
A new chapter of space exploration is just beginning with Juno in orbit around Jupiter.  This mission promises many discoveries.
Blind us!
@GCataldoNASA BELLISSIMO BRAVI!!!
, grazie mille! Anche se non sono direttamente coinvolto in questa missione, è fantastico vedere dove siamo arrivati.

Juno will look beneath the thick atmosphere of Jupiter to see if there is a solid or a liquid core.  And it goes farther away.
Juno will map Jupiter's very intense magnetic field, measure the amount of water and ammonia in the deep atmosphere and more.
It was a journey of almost five years, travelling 2.8 billion kilometers to arrive to the giant planet and explore inside Jupiter.
We'll learn more than ever on the largest planet of our planetary system.   We'll discover many new facts about planet Jupiter.
can't wait to see the pics
When are we going to get to see some photos?
Congratulations!
nice nasa juno
gonna regret fucking with mayan moon alignment prophesie ..js
jajajajaaa xDDDD
y'all should be ashamed of y'all self anyone can tell those images of outerspace aint real..seriously its  computer graphics
waste of freakin money
♡♡♡
I need photos of Jovian system please. Not the team.
Photos?????
Still amazing to realize @NASAJuno is in orbit around Jupiter. Just 60 years ago, we couldn't put anything into orbit around the Earth.
congratulations!!!
#SpaceOut
Great Job!!!
Why no new pics yet?  Juno, Do we have a problem?
Contributing Excitement and Future to This Lifetine We All Share... So Very Cool.
Is it true? Are us men more stupid(er). :D
.@NASAJuno Manuel A Rubio we are all so proud! The Rubio Family @NASAJuno
@NicholasLPinto
very awesome work!
"Great Kid....DON'T GET COCKY!" Han Solo   Don't forget that....when it comes to "unlocking" Jupiter's secrets....that's her call
#HappyEid2016 #Jupiter 
And Good luck #Juno 
#SaudiArabia

Yay, we fly with NASA too, vicariously! @NASAJuno
How amazing is this?! Io might be our best shot at other life in the universe!
Congratulations!! So proud of the team!! Hi Jupiter!! Ready to share with us?
Anxious to hear news from Jupiter.
QUE BIEN,
, I'm very interested in following your work and discoveries.
Truly an astronomical feat!
Where are the pictures?
I hope to publish soon on the alien ship is located in the "hurricane of jupiter"
wow
Congrats! 5 yrs is not a long time! Can't wait to hear more, great photos!
so inspiring. Please teach congress a few things about teamwork
great job Juno team
do you mean, from earth to Jupiter?
Congratulations @NASA team. An exciting mission for the entire world. VB, @Bulc_EU Commisioner for transport
Approximately a year ago New Horizons executed its Pluto flyby, and now Juno's reached Jupiter! Wonder what next year holds! 
I’m so happy for you.Jupiter banzai
Congratulations! Also Sprach Zarathusta had to be on & a black monolith unveiled at moment of orbital insertion #cantdothatdave
in my imagination this crater was created by the impact with a planet that was between Mars and Jupiter.
Is it possible that Jupiter has a rock core and a crater deep thousand of kilometers, that produce the stationary redspot?
The vision limit of human eye is now 365 million miles...! Congratulations Juno...
great team
축하합니다~~!!♡♡♡
Spectacular! I would have loved to see more women in that control room though.
Live this. The @NASA snaps were terrific and exciting.
you guys kick so much ass!
http://goo.gl/Ss4nJS 
CONGRATULATIONS, NASA Juno Team! With Much Love!
Godspeed - continue to push the known limits!
amazing. So inspiring!!
In case you've been oblivious to the incredible and fascinating achievement that is @NASAJuno
Teamwork! From #Jupiter to Earth: thanks, team for guiding me into orbit. And now… SCIENCE https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/juno_spacecraft_in_orbit_around_mighty_jupiter … 
Congrats!
It is sad that we get a bad graphic simulation instead of a delayed live feed of Jupiter after all this is 2016 not 1971!
I love all of NASA's work!!! It's inspiring and it changes the world 
My mind said me,this year @NASAJuno will give great news ||about of life there||
Congratulations to the Team!
congratulation to the @NASAJuno Team!
Dear Juno, we seem to have a problem processing your S-pass info, please contact us about your unpaid space toll fees.
Yay!  Now show us the damn GoPro photos!  -the World @NASAJuno
congratulations!! This is a big feat!
#askNASA Is there a specific reason to have the whole spacecraft descend rather than a wireless camera transmitting to the craft?
@NASA_Johnson @NASAJuno congratulations

Super congrats, NASA! Thanks for all the hard work. Looking forward to next week's footage and coverage. HAZZAH!
YESSSS
Awesome job people! Cant wait for some juicy jupiter info.
am so overwhelmed #Juno has finally found its new orbit  in a much awaited Titanic Showdown around Jupiter @DrPhiltill @AlanStern
Congratulations everyone!  So looking forward to this.  :)
congratulations Nasa
SCIENCE!
@IAstrobiologia Juno llega a Jupiter
congrats Juno...great!!
congratulations to the Best team
The power of your teamwork is awesome! The science is so cool and awesome to ponder! Well done @NASAJuno @NASA !
Hearty congratulations to the Juno team on this marvellous achievement.
Who's the guy with the red-white-blue hat?!?
amazing
congratulations team
Sofa king amazing!!!!
I am still wondering how that thing survived all the way to jupiter. NASA should make a phone like that which can survive anything
Couldn't have said it better! That tweet is now on my @RebelMouse  http://rbl.ms/29nY4h0 
An awesome work for new generation
Congratulations!
Nice Work Mission .
Ok
.Grate Work NASA Cience with NASA Earth.Nice Job Guys.
imagine trying to land a bullet on a flying bulet while standing on a roof of a riding train, you guys are amazing!!!! Great job!!

Parabéns a todos da Equipe que trabalharam nesse projeto
Congrats on such a huge achievement.  Can't wait to read the discoveries that #Juno makes.
Congrats Juno Mission Team 
@NASAJPL Please how long does it take to communicate to Juno from Earth?
I think it takes 1 hour
Thanks
congrats to entire NASA Juno tram great job
@InnovativeHindu With so many poor people on earth..should we be doing these expensive junkets?
Yes. The sooner we get off this rock the less likely we'll die on it like the poor dinosaurs.
Cool, congratulations!
.congratulazioni
Amazing work!  Looking forward to the images!
Congratulations!!! Good luck for the next steps! 
NOW THE REAL ADVENTURE BEGINS!!
it was pluto flyby last year and now orbit insertion, just incredible
Congratulations all! Another fine example of what can be done when humans work together :) #science
Great work! 
Is time for the big one
While I am fascinated by space, I would rather see us abandon space exploration in favour of fixing our world. #SaveOurWorld
Congratulations!
Another finest hour.
@NASAJuno 
#NASAJuno #JunoAtJupiter
Congratulations @NASA, @NASAJPL & the international science & #DeepSpaceNetwork partners.
Can't wait to see all your gorgeous photos, Juno. Don't work too hard out there!
