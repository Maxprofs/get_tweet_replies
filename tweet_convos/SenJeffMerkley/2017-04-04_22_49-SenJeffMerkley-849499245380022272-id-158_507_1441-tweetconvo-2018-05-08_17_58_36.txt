Watching from Phoenix
Man you got guts. I could have taped but I prefer to watch what DEMOCRACY looks like. Proud USA citizen.
Thank you, Senator!
I'm very proud of you for standing up to the GOP who kicked Garland to the curb.  Gorsuch is an illegitimate nominee and deserves nothing.
i will never understand why Gorsuch would not remove himself, he ran ads and played into this dreadful scheme.
Thank you Senator. This is a great and historic service to the nation.
Hang in there, Senator. We the people have your back!
Way to go!  You're an inspirational representative of our democratic process. Thank you for standing for our constitutional rights!
PERSIST, INSIST, RESIST
Oregon says, don't "crater" on us now.  You're doing great.  Stay strong! #HoldTheFloor #StopGorsuch
