impeach Trump and Pence now
well done! Thank you for reading the letter! #letlizspeak
You and Wyden are disqusting shouldn't you be doing work on behalf of Oregon rather than an obstructionist?

: Total leftist BS. Oregon needs to throw you out!
Please explain why you and others were allowed to read this and Warren wasnt.
Can anyone explain the difference? Same floor, same issue? Am I missing something that isn't gender related?
it's because Merkley  is irrelevant.
at least 4 men read the same letter, what was the diff?
Thank you Sen Merkley.  You represent what most moral American citizens feel about equal rights, freedom for all!
Your Elizabeth is s fraud, perhaps Cherokee cheekbones .She was silenced because she doesn't know how to behave.

Debunked. Lie from Sessions himself.
Thank you Senator Merkley for your courage and support.  I'm a proud consituent.

thank you standing for what is right

Thank you, Senator Merkley, for standing up for social justice. You make me proud to be an Oregonian.
Nothing more than political grandstanding. Stop obstructing and stalling. Vote on cabinet nominees and get to work.
#StillShePersisted! BRAVO! When will the Impeachment begin PLEASE HURRY!!!
63 Million of us voted 4 Pres.@realDonaldTrump along w/ 81% of #Evangelicals! Ur Party will NEVER WIN the White House Again
Thank you Senator from a Massachusetts fan.
Why are you so ignorant about Jeff Sessions? Have you done ANY research on the man? Or(most likely)just politics.
To Republicans  a male voice reading the same words are considered better than a woman's voice.  Ticks me off!
 thank you!
when will we ever get a senator that represents Eastern Oregon??
thank you for sharing the words of CSK @SenWarren wasn't allowed to share. #LetHerSpeak
thank you Senator
@RannMillar @SenateGOP thank you.
more fake news from you...shame on you!
thank you!!!! A thousand thank yous for standing up for what's right and reading #CorrettaWords
thank you for your words and for standing with my @SenWarren. you @SenateDems rock! #ShameGOP they have lost their morals
well you don't represent my interests
Thank you, Senator!
I appreciate you standing up for Americans that are against the racist, hateful, and greedy agenda. I respect your fortitude
We've heard #CorettasWords & reject your cheap political trick. Remember, #RepubsWon. #MAGA.
Thank you Senator Merkley
So embarrassed that @senrobportman
won't stand strong against #Sessions
long time ago and not proven.  Character assassination  designed to fuel violence on streets
Thank you for showing the decency and integrity I would expect from a representative from Oregon.
could you please speak about the fact that your male privilege allowed to you say this when Warren was censured?
Thank you for speaking up.
thank you! You are everything a senator from this great state of Oregon should be!
Thank you!!!!!

you never lashed out a Byrd for being in the KKK you Dems always just said, " he's changes now"
Byrd wasn't nominated to be the US AG. West Va voters elected him, nothing other senators could do.
The other senators praised him.

Thank you so much Senator!  You are a hero and am an with integrity!
The meltdown of the Dems and the left continues. Glorious!  #repsupermajority2018
Thank you for your courage in standing up for all Americans!  So proud to call you my Senator!
so proud of my senator!  My dream ticket "Warren/Merkley 2020"
saw you on #CNN last night! Good job, keep fighting the good fight!
@TheDemocrats @GOP Jeff Sessions is not qualified to represent ALL Americans
At least they were able to get someone more feminine than Coretta to read it.
Do nothing peacock incited PDX riots -> beat man unconscious 1/29/17

@PrisonPlanet @BreitbartNews @seanhannity
@MoveOn @SenateGOP Democrats MSM fight for terrorists in Yemen but let blacks in Chicago be murdered by thousands
Stop being an obstructionist in Washington. We will not forget what you are doing
@McConnel_leads you can't hide the truth!
Thank you, Senator Merkley!
THANK YOU for making me proud to be an Oregonian. Keep fighting for us, Jeff.
Senator-I am NOT a Dem BUT I applaud your strong relentless efforts to protect our democracy. Thank you!
Thank you Senator Merkley for standing up for us and fighting for us!
THANK YOU for doing this. Also PLEASE be sure NOT to meet w or proceed in any manner w SCOTUS nom. #StolenSeat
Stop trying to sully #CorettasWords and to bring our revered civil rights leader down to your unAmerican level.
I don't understand how you, Sanders, others were allowed to read full letter after Warren shut down?
my guess is that they saw how much attention it gave Warren and knew they screwed up.
Thank you to my Senator Merkley!

THANK YOU Senator.
