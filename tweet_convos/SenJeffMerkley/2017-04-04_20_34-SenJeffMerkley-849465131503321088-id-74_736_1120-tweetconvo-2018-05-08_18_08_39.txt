Great job! More ammo for you....
A short section in Neil Gorsuch's 2006 book appears to be copied from a law review article https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/a-short-section-in-neil-gorsuchs-2006-book-appears-to-be?utm_term=.glW9eLxVqn#.qxyW9eyB2w … 
He's a vicous right wing extremist who cloaks himself in the guise of being a Christian
@RonWyden get2work stop ur games! U cant stop the vote! U should b ashamed of how u r treating #GorsuchHearing #voteGorsuch
As an Oregonian I am extremely embarrassed of Jeff Merkley. He does Not represent the values of southern Oregonians. He Must be voted out.
And he plagerized parts of his book!

Thank you for your efforts, Senator!
Not easy to be to the right of Scalia. Frightening
Beautiful site isn't it!!! Justice Gorsuch!!! Has a great ring to it!!!!
You used the wrong "sight" in your tweet,Dick.
Awwwe thanks for noticin!!!
Da nada, Brother
He's as conservative as Uncle Thomas? Wow. That's saying something.
Except the American Bar Association mainstream where he is given the highest rating possible.
One whom Ron Wyden previously voted for...wonder how he missed that ;-)
That's not very convincing, given the different contexts.
what is wrong with a conservative who protects the 2nd amendment,Constitution, and also reads the constitution as printed!!?
He is a threat to the dems wanting make the Constitution a living changing document.
This looks like a quiz I would find in cosmo. However even cosmo does a better job than this justice mess
Perfect! 
Some aide is working overtime. Hope you're paying #EqualPay
Looks good to me.
Painted with a slightly different brush 
Did you ever notice how much Republicans hate activist judges? Of course they waive their outrage when it's an activist, conservative judge.
@CaptainsLog2017 Gorsuch is member of good ol' boys club where money is king & comes before people & country. #holdthefloor
Thank you, Senator. No one's ever going to forget what you're doing for us all tonight.
Oh yea they will. Already forgetting.

Gorsuch is replacing Scalia. Nothing is going to change on the SCOTUS with Gorsuch in!
when I voted for you it was because you were supposed to be a national security analyst. Gorsuch is exactly what the russians ordered.

Again, would make Scalia look like Louis Brandeis.Forget the palpably fake humility/affability while dodging every damnl question!
#Gorsuch is bad for America.
I'm afraid we will be stuck with him. Nuclear option. There no hope for checks and balances any longer.
Wish republican senator dean heller would educate himself.  Oh wait he determines a Supreme Court nominee if he likes fly fishing.  Wow.
We support you. Thank you
Thank you
blah blah blah. Lefty
He's also a plagiarist. #GorsuchPlagiarism
Thank you, Senator!!#GoJeffGo #HoldTheFloor
He's also a guy who plagiarizes law review articles:
You know this makes perfect sense for dumb conservative voters who always copied their homework. "He is one of US"
Thank You for your eloquence and courage! #holdthefloor Say NO to Gorsuch!  Where are @JoeManchinWV @SenatorHeitkamp #shame
Great job Senator!! Keep it up! #holdthefloor
Real ? What other judges really want to have to interact with him Ruth, Clarence which one if any ?
You are doing a great job. 
Good for you! Stand strong!!! Proud of you all! @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @DNC @SenWarren @SenSanders @SenSchumer
Thank you!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for your public service, honesty, diligence, clarity, and for doing the hard work needed to protect #Democracy!
THANK YOU
#Gorsuch unanimous appointee in 2006, including by then Sen Obama.  Quit being obstructionist, do your job!
The "mainstream" judiciary has turned into a super-legislature and needs to be reigned in.
@SenSanders @SenSchumer Fine speech, Bernie: for voting, women, & labor rights & to move billionaire money out of politics vote Gorsuch down
Thank you for filibustering. 
Thank you for standing up against Gorsuch!

Pres. Obama says you are wrong to put Party ahead of Country.
Doesn't the chart mean that Thomas is way outside of the mainstream? Here Gorsuch is more or less close to Alito and Scalia @SenJeffMerkley
gorsuch is a done deal
Thank you Senator!
HEY, that's your next Supreme Court Justice you're talking about brah!
Keep going! We stand with you! #resist #SCOTUS
A heartfelt thank you for all you're doing! We need more Senators like you! 
Fake News.
This is total crap. Origionalism is totally antithetical to judicial activism. Accusing conservatives of judicial activism is insane.
Keep going! We are all with you!
Let's sure hope so!!!
If you think so, you should fully commit to your bullshit & call for his impeachment & removal from 10th circuit.  #MAGA
