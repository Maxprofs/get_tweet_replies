Seriously? Wasting time on writing rubbish? We are in this mess because democrats passed ACA in the first place! Fix it!!!
Bot.
There's still a war to win, so keep them handy.
Please tell me you slipped a couple Garfield comics in there, or like an amendment ordering the Lincoln Memorial be made animatronic
Looks like @SenateMajLdr Mcconnell must be delinquent on Satan's bill.
