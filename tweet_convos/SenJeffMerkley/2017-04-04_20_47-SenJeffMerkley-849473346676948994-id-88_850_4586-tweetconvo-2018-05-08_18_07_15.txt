Thank you cory. But you cant fight the fbi from within the party. Its too little too late.
Moran
traitor.
@SenJeffMerkley Odd you didn't join him, want to tell me how Kagan is more qualified? Never sat on a bench period.. I'll wait...
I'm done with you jerks left wingers for today haha
I'm proud of @SenJeffMerkley and proud to be an Oregonian. Sir, Sen Booker, will you also step up?
I'm so done with the partisan BS. You guys care more about party than constituents--and you're supposed to be one of the good ones.
Hats off to Sen. Merkley! True public service.
That's s boy , give us a good reason to nuke your butts.
Thank you too, Sen. Booker. We appreciate that you were among the first to speak out-- loudly.
Moran!
Sen Booker, can you help him hold the floor?  Can other Dems gve this guy a break & keep going? 
No, no one joined him all night, D. Due in joined about 5am. Tells you this is just grandstanding.
It's embarrassing your my senator...can you please describe what you believe are mainstream views?
@SenJeffMerkley Wow,  This is very useful. Glad you guys are solving the nations problems.  #obstruction. #useless
Booker in the back pocket of Big Pharma. He will applaud Green Eggs And Ham being read by Merkley. See? Hypocrisy much? VOTE GREEN 2020!
Thank you for supporting @SenJeffMerkley #holdthefloor
Just don't jeopardize your health
I would hope that you'd be ready to step in next, and keep this going, Senator.
President Trump is the best thing to happen in this country for decades. There is zero evidence of collusion 0 NONE NONE ZERO SI SHUT Up
You people are all so f---- up
Term limits

Left wing nazi both of you and all dems
Plagiarism?
We're with you all the way @CoryBooker ! Speaking as one of your constituents.
Who else is there to keep this going?  I am so proud to see you & my Dems  demand the the Trump nonsense stop.
Moran!
Thank you!
Dah Dah Thank You Dah
Thank you Senator Merkley. Stay strong!
Moran!
Obama refused to even NOMINATE a black person for the Supreme Court

Example http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/8061012/1/ …
Rs are going nuclear. Ds are losing the last bit of influence they have for this? STUPID!!  Do this and the party will vanish forever.
I know you want to move up in your party, but you amaze me how you just follow like a sheep. Learn to think and act for yourself
Are you joining?
Resign
@CoryBooker are you going to run for governor of NJ?
Loser- Gorsuch confirmed on Friday. Play time is over
I used to like you
Don't you guys got a tree to save

Thank you Senator Jeff Merkley! We love you. #PleaseVoteNoOnGorsuch We do not want Supreme Court Judge that copies others law review article
Seriously need you to stand up and impeach him. Do not stop. We need you !!!
#getthemansomeRedbull
Thank you.
Go out and speak with him!
Slow clap...
Looking forward to voting against @SenJeffMerkley.  I'm his constituent and his self serving partisan behavior is disgusting

What he said @SenJeffMerkley
I love my Senator!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley ! #holdthefloor
Recall Jeff!!! You are ruining this country!!
#AcceptGorsuch #StoptheTantrums
Way to go Senators! Thank you for your patriotism. Let's talk about plagiarism!! @politico.
ready to tag in when neede Senator?
EVERYBODY thank Jeff!
Cory, this is a pointless exercise. I am saddened to be a democrat. A fight is called for but not a symbolic one. This is pathetic.
Warren take a walk on the Red Carpet! It's thriving!
A true waste of time and God will probably give President Trump 2 more justices in the next 8 years! Careful boys...lead don't follow.
I hope you are next in line to hold the floor, Senator.
.@CoryBooker @SenJeffMerkley ProTip: Filabustering someone almost unanimously confirmed to last job is why you'll lose more seats in '18.
Shhhh Frank! They don't get it! We like it like that! #TurnItRed
Thank you, and thank you to all the Senators still fighting to protect us.
@SenateGOP - don't break the Senate. #Vote No & #StopGorsuch
@SenSanders Bye Bye Booker. The approx 45% of registered Independents are going to #DraftBernie #StillSanders #DNCLeaks #PodestaEmails
Yes, thank you @SenJeffMerkley for those 2013 changes to the filibuster rules.
@SenJeffMerkley thank you Senator Merkley!
Thank you for your courage
So anything anti republican is now worthy of praise? That seems childish and counter productive. What a sad scene.
Give him the gorsuck plagiarize info
You're destroying our country. Anti-Booker for president sentiment already percolating because of his hate
and the blathering fools continue their childish games.  SMH. on the hypocrites of the @SenateDems
Jimmy Stewart would be proud. #MrSmith
Some people are fighting the good fight on the senate floor (yawn), but @CoryBooker ? Tweeting the good fight from his cell phone.
What a waste of time Americans see through the democrats and will continue to vote them OUT #WeHaveHadEnough #Gorsuchfilibuster
History  being made this sadly will be the last  filabuster
Senator Booker, are you helping Jeff tonight?
I am in agreement on you with this one, thank you grr actually doing your job—but you're still not gonna' be president.
Why aren't other @SenateDems there helping? Or are they? No TV here. Stand with @SenJeffMerkley!
@SenJeffMerkley thank you! You have our support! Fighting for what is right is never easy, but it is sure worth it
Hold on. Y'all are up now?
@SenJeffMerkley #Stop Gorsuch #Don't let the Republicans change the rules to elect Gorsuch. #Proud Senators #Thank you.
May GOD be with you soldier of the nation 
Where are U? We heard from u.
@CoryBooker WHY AREN'T YOU ON THE FLOOR WITH HIM, SENATOR?
