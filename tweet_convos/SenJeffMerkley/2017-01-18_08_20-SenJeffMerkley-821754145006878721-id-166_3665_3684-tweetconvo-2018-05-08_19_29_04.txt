#Pruitt used Oklahoma AG’s office as a direct extension of an oil company rather than for the public health of the people of Oklahoma.
FAKE NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!
please block them ALL Senator!
@AynRandPaulRyan I am very confused by the dates on the 2 letters: 2014 vs 2011 
. What, on earth, will it take to get your attention?
Please forgive my typo...Should have been Yes
@Annalee_Perez #Pruitt has sued the EPA 13 times in favor of his corporate masters #bigoil
fire him
Hello...His racist, mysogistic, blantent disregard for LBGTQ rights won't stop him from being confirmed & you're worried about cut & paste?
Dictionaries will have appalling new synonyms for US govt: kakistocracy, kleptocracy, kratocracy.  Oh, look, three k's.
Yes.
What is with all the under qualified and ethically compromised nominees from the incoming admin? Corrupt leadership?
I believe the word you're looking for is #kakistocracy @thorNyourside @SenJeffMerkley
Thank you for that word. I hate that the USA is now a #kakistocracy. We are the snowball headed for hell!
So many things concern me about this, it's hard to know where to begin.
When you decide, I hope you'll call your US Senator ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
YES, YES IT SHOULD!
What is it with DJT Goons and plagiarism!?!
Yrs indeed it it should.
it's not the first time they plagiarized stuff & it won't be the last. Everyone take out their bingo cards & get ready 4 fun
@AynRandPaulRyan No need to wonder why they rushed his nomination.
It should.. But Republicans aren't everyone. They're in this for themselves..
@ohiomail Isn't this similar to ALEC work w legislators? They write the law!
most bills are drafted by staffers and lobbyist. The people are just a catch phrase these days.
True. ALEC funded by Koch Bros so bills written 4 legislators to favor oil, stand your ground etc
@SenSchumer he seemed a bit sketchy. .
#Pruitt They call it plagarism, and demonstrates a candidates lack of integrity and the ability to write
@SenMurray @SenSanders @SenSchumer Please look into this before votes
...and inside the @GOP, not one single fuck was given.
#OwnedAndOperated
GOP must be held accountable. Not one has a conscience. This is disgusting. Party of corruption.
What is it with Trump's choices and plagarizing.  DeVos, Crowley.  Trumps picking people who don't do their own thinking!
(2 of 2): Bigger issue: he lies about climate change and made a career suing the agency he's about to lead.
(1 of 2): Common practice on both sides of almost all policy issues, left and right.
This is shaping up to be the most corrupt administration ever...and they haven't even started the job yet!
#Pruitt should not be confirmed. Plagiarism is why Crowley stepped down.
lol in his defense, he sold Oklahoma to frackers ; ) https://nyti.ms/2k1MRoB  (also see "OK fracking earthquakes").
thank you for sharinh.  Must block Pruitt!
yes, yes it should.
Very swampy! The lobbyists official agent!
ALEC wrote bills, send them to the GOP who would do what Jeff did. Pass them off as their own ideas as "bills" they wrote.
Plagiarism is all the rage in Post-Truth America. Pruitt can be bought? Surprise?
I'm betting Jeff is a major proponent & booster ofALEC. A rightwing thinktank that came up with the idea of voter fraud
DT is surrounding himself with severely compromised people to make himself look good, when it's having the opposite effect.
This says it all about DT's ability to make rationale educated choices for key offices in government. Every pick a failure!
This about the executive ability of making decisions about choices. Every pick is ethically challenged, & morally bankrupt.
Work is hard. Elected officials rarely have a breadth of skills or interests. This is Trump's political deplorable base.
-Yrs, it does. Have to wonder how much $$ that energy company contributed to his campaigns in OK? & how rote his reply was.
@Safari_Street  #WomensMarch  #TheResistance
It should. But Russian hacking SHOULD concern everyone, too, don't you think? 
- Do not approve Pruitt for EPA. One of the worst choices in a pretty bad bunch.
#CabinetOfDeplorables
this from Oklahoma paper tells more
@NormEisen please vote no on Trump cabinet nominees
Extremely concerning-in fact,  disqualifying.  Say NO to #PollutingPruitt #BlockPruitt
@skookerG Holy cow! Who in their right mind would approve this guy? Example Republicans acting like this last election ever.
dang! wish I could read that small print!
@NormEisen Another Plagiarist phony.  Ideas not his own; words of lobbyists.
Yes?
@timkaine @SenWarren Can you believe this???
it should but you assume that their conscience hasn't already been seared by graft and malice such that it is DOA now.
listening to ALL of #Trump picks causes concern - Pruitt, Sessions, Devos, Price, Tillerson.
HELL YES!
@tkdmike
OMG Slimeballs one and all!
you have ignored the plight of most rural Oregonians.. shouldn't we all be concerned about THAT..
LOCK HIM UP! HE'LL, LOCK 'EM ALL UP IN THE SAME CELL
#Pruitt is just trying to make America Oklahoma again. b/c fracking water tastes gray(T) & all day earthquakes are fun. 
he didnt even read the cliffnotes?  Just like mr trump!
Senator are you attending the inauguration? Please make our state proud and don't.
please vote against these people! DeVos?? Come on!
dramatically lowers chance of typos
these are the types of people DJT can come up with: liars, bigots, cheats. please, oh please, block this! #horriblepicks
There's so much concern about Pruitt, it's hard to know where to begin.
@speechboy71 Hey Melania did it so its a ok
It concerns me but apparently not @SenateMajLdr - he seems fine with all of them
@Trumpnado2016 check out Marathon mr. X NPR news story.
it's highlighted a death in the Bakken where Marathon Oil tried to cover it up settled for millions of dollar
doj investigating now
Not really, I think it is a requirement for this administration.  #Crowley
Yes it is a concern. All these nominees need ethics office ok & complete disclosure @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Need hearings
YES, IT SHOULD! Please vote against these HORRIBLE cabinet nominees. Protect our nation!
An Okie from Muskogee with a plagiarism fetish.
He didn't seem very concerned...just horrid for our country, environment, and world as we know it.
Yes. Thank you, Senator.
@alikat747 greatly
Yes!
you think by now @gop would've learned about plagiarism
It's a big complicated word.
Well, maybe before the First Black POTUS but now anything goes.
yes
Hells Yeah! Do we have any power to prevent these nominees from taking office?
Everything about this whole election and subsequent Cabinet selection concerns me!
Plagiarism is acceptable in Trump world. So is ignorance.
@Lee_in_Iowa  yes!! All us ducks should be concerned.
@IndivisibleTeam  GOP doesn't care. They will all get confirmed. #sigh
@Maggyw519 Jesus Christ. Absolutely reprehensible.
@SenSchumer was he cutting it out and then pasting?like we did in kindergarten?
notice that the top 12 lines appear to have been copied and pasted as well.
@IndivisibleTeam Trump team elevates plagiarists.
It concerns me.
The lobbyists weren't paying @AGScottPruitt enough to have him write them from scratch.
@IndivisibleTeam @SenBennetCO  That is wrong, as are most of Trump's picks.
@Riela2 It concerns me.
Every corrupt action the Trump team is committing and wants to commit concerns and troubles me. It's not good.
It's clear he takes orders straight from his corporate masters. It'd be interesting to check his website for ghostwriting.
nauseating
.@SenJeffMerkley Yes, it should matter to everyone. What has happened to morals & ethics??
#ScottPruitt conflicts of interest and questionable practices as AG render him unfit to head any fed agency, especially #EPA
@KJ_Jeller Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
@sacca @crystale Yes. #Pruitt has no understanding of own original writing cf. giving attribution to sources. #ThiefofIdeas
@KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @SenWhite good god. Stop this man.
the lack of ethics on many of nominees is staggering. Why would GOP vote for them?  Makes them as unethical as nominee.
Happening in Canada too.
The next four years (if #PUSSYGRABBER lasts that long) will have absolutely NO ETHICS.
To be fair, Monica Crowley was his Press Secretary.
I strongly oppose the confirmation of Pruitt. Thank you for your support
it does say recycled paper :)
Thank you and keep up the pressure.
@lizrosej .
This is what we are getting from many in high profile government positions!
They R bought & paid 4by lobbyists
@GOP plagiarizing?
Shocked I say..
GOP taking from poor for rich
#ShockedISay
They're a Criminal Conspiracy
@ToniTagliarino
Wow. His office likely received an emailed editable version of the lobbyist letter in order to do that. Crazy.
Trump's cabinet and himself are nothing but a scam on the American people. Corrupt to the core.
Oy vay. It keeps getting worse
good point. Please vote no @SenDeanHeller @SenCortezMasto on #PruittHearing
unacceptable, please block his appointment. @monicaMedHist
@stphil Looks like plagiarism to me.  Of course Republicans are very good at  this
It concerns those with integrity, which does not describe most of @GOP Senators. Party over country with that bunch. #Ethics
Wait, your beef is that #Pruitt copied something, but not that what he copied alleges EPA is deliberately inflating stats?
it is directly from a lobbyist who mislead people. Glad you said alleges. Gives you some credibility, surprisingly.
What was the misleading part?
it is what lobbyists do. They misinform and misled. Paid to CONvince lawmakers their point is good for everyone not just a client.
Agreed: http://freebeacon.com/issues/report-attacking-epa-critics-traced-green-pressure-group/ …
but never a company with ties to a republican official?
No. It works both ways. Give politicians the power to regulate & they'll sell those regulations to whoever pays.
I'll agree to that. I am partial to saving the planet through. I like my oil and gas but not fracking.
@VeniceRiley Just confirms that he's qualified for Team Trump...
lmfao jesus
@dana1981 should NOT surprise anyone
@SenSchumer no!
@SenSchumer Shameful!
@Sen_JoeManchin @SenWarren @SenWarren @SenCapito @SenSherrodBrown VOTE NO
@SenSchumer Vote No!
No, because members of the GOP, committing acts of terrorism on U.S. citizens, are busy going from power-hungry to power-mad
At least it shows he's proficient with Microsoft Word
Enough!  Stop him!
Crowley, Carson, Pruitt.  Not an original thought or word between them. #copynpaste #myword #appropriategate
plagerism is the best part of Pruitt.  Character flaw
please don't confirm.
@SenSchumer It should. ..
Yes we are concerned about every nominee they have all exposed themselves as completemorons and unfit for reality let alone their Positions
@TheTacoSalazar 
Check this out
@SenSchumer #FillingTheSwamp
@SierraClub It concerns me greatly
Not surprising. Never has a finer group of crooks been assembled. God help us all.
#Pruitt Yes, it should.  It certainly concerns me.
The @GOP sure does love to plagiarize...
letter on left from whom/what entity? Didn't see it- Lobbyisten?
@SenSchumer yes....
Please vote against Pruitt and Betsy.  Neither are good choices.
@SierraClub I'm concerned.  Our children's future is not for sale.
30x more potent than CO2? Methane has at least 84x more global warming potential than CO2. It's why warming exceeds models.
Yes, it should.
doesn't concern me
