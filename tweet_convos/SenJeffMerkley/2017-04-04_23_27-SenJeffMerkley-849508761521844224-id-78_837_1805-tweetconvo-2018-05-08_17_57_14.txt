Plz tell me this is a fake acct. Can a Senator be this ignorant? Um, never mind. Yes, they can 
Keep up the leftist resistance...more GOP senators on the way in mid terms!
Thank you!!!
What a joke.Ever since Judges were appointed for political reasons rather than as jurists the rule of law has been undermined.
@SenTedCruz @johncornyn #NoVote until #TrumpRussiaCollusion is investigated!
Thank you Senator Merkley for trying to stop this aberration of justice - first time ever Congress tried to steal a Supreme Court seat!
LoL, first time they undermined the rule of law. After years of political malpractice are you really surprised? the vote, the law, the money
Like a petulant child...
@SenJeffMerkley, the American people can't steal what belonged to them in the first place. That's what the election was about. You lost.
This photo shows you right next to the very document that proves you wrong. No requirement for congress to advise and consent SCOTUS nominee
Thank you from Astoria!!!

You're a joke and an embarrassment to your office for what you're doing.
From moment FBI said POTUS & Co. are under investigation, no one he's nominated for anything should be confirmed until it's over
Sorry. That's not how it works. Elections have consequences- Barry said so. You lost
Appreciate the attempt. All you had to do was not nominate the witch whose DNC stole the nomination from Bernie. Democrats elected Trump.
Where are the rest of the Democratic Senators?  You're amazing, but why are you alone?
Not a stolen seat. Have u read the Constitution? I hope we can get a few more conservative judges on supreme Court under Trump! #MAGA
Hat's off to you, Senator. THIS is what true patriotism means, something that the egregious, hypocrite #McConnell will never understand.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley 
Thank you!!!
wrong
Thank you!!!!

How about no.
Thanks Jeff! Remember Merrick Garland!
Thank you, Jeff. At least someone cares about a reduction in personal freedom.
Thank you Senator! You are standing up for all of us... fight on!!
Yes!!! #GarlandNotGorsuch #holdthefloor
And that chin flab twatwaffle @SenateMajLdr Mitch Mc Connell is soooo proud of himself. Ugh.
Still with you in Oregon,  SenAtor!
I just wanted to tell you good luck. We're all rooting for you.
I'm still with you at 1:24 PDT and learning lots from your informed filibuster. Go team, Go Jeff!. Don't let the bullies win uncontested!
Thurmond, in protest of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, has the record. I have a feeling this stain of a record  will end this year #holdthefloor
thank you for working to #StopGorsuch
You are AMAZING. From Ohio I cant say Thank you enough. Keep fighting
Our checks & balances seem to be broken, & it's getting worse.
You are a true hero! We appreciate you & all you're doing! Thank u for taking a stand & representing us concerned Americans!

Coffee Time...
Thank you for standing up and speaking up for the future of our nation. May God bless you.
Thank you, Senator! The #resistance is cheering you on. #holdthefloor #GoJeffGo #StopGorsuch
thats only the start. And if you stand in their way they will just treat you like they treated clinton. People will allow it because you did
I wish Alabama had a senator like @SenJeffMerkley .
Democrats broke the rules, Dirty Harry did it so dont complain Senator
Thank you so much! Grateful you're my voice in DC! You're making #Oregon proud right now! #holdthefloor #resist #stopgorsuch

But they are not going to steal it! #StopGorsuch
Thank you, Senator Merkley, for doing what is right.
Thank you Sir!! 
A Democrat standing tall
Oh well then, if Cher said it.... Wait, tho -- Did Sarandon say it, too? (Every good conservative knows you need evidence from 2 women!) 
Please let him know we are watching and cheering him on! Senator Merkley is a ROCKSTAR!
