Told #OMBNom @RepMickMulvaney in hearing: huge tax cuts for the rich mean increased deficits - saying otherwise is an #alternativefact.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley, but let's not confuse or normalize this issue. "Saying otherwise is" A LIE!
oh look another photo debunking yours.

try not to lie anymore please
What's really funny is that you can still see the crowd thins out way before the Washington memorial.
no it does not, even the @cnn megapixel allows you to see the crowd reaching it
Drumpf called CNN fake news, so how do you know if this photo is real?
because there are other photos to verify it.

lol using Drumpf?

keep crying egghead
Please share them.
gladly

not to mention the gigapixel that cnn shared which is accurate(for once they get it)
Yes, another photo shot from a low angle with nothing to compare. Wow.
the real pic!!! #trump
@painter_nancy @RepMickMulvaney And can we make "pledges" legally binding? Maybe "oaths" too while we're at it?
Your Trump inauguration photo is a lie! A very deliberate one. SHAME! Watched every minute on TV. Saw TRUTH
- thank you for spending our time and $ on this.
What time were they taken?
Do you pledge to stop lying and using #alternativepics to embarrass President Trump? You should be ashamed!
This was hilarious, thank you!
Just remember, you are part of the reason @realDonaldTrump is now @POTUS


how about this??? Why do you guys lie so much it's mind boggling
nice work Senator!!!
yes we need cabinet members that will not feed Trump's sociopathic #fantasy
"tax cuts cause government revenue increases" #AlternativeFacts
Do you pledge to tweet out fake news from CNN? Please our senators should be smarter than you! Pompous
I think this is to distract us from the real business at hand; figuring out healthcare costs
I call BS 

#Kudos Great question & great comparison of inauguration photos
The @CNN GIGAPIX shows the actual crowd larger so your question is silly

Give em hell Merkley!
you're worried about audience instead of budget chief? Do your job! #failure #Oregon @realDonaldTrump #AmericaGreatAgain
stop putting out lies Merkley. Time to think about getting you recalled.

...please post a photo of Hillary's inauguration.
will honest ethical employees support liars?   OMB will be made up of alt facts= 45th Narcissit President
real problem is OMB #s important in legislation process.   Liar Trump can use OMB to get what he wants.
a fucking elected official cares about crowd sz. Lunatics


No he pledges to remember your name and any bill with your name on it crosses his desk. Can you spell VETO
Anyone report on the tons of garbage left behind, comparing 2012 to 2017?
Grow up and get to work. Democrats like you is why Democrats keep loosing seats in Congress #alternatefacts
Even if Trump's crowd was not as big as Obama's (was a freak show), it was much bigger than the pic u show
Dems, Media and Trump need to stop talking about this.. Who gives a fig??
You are my HERO! THANK YOU for proving this point so definitively and so well. Thank you for representing the PEOPLE! 
Blatant fake news
The photo on the left was taken @ BO address; the on the right was taken 3-4 hours before the address
Shame you can't compare crowd size with Trump/ Clinton Egnauration.Oh wait,Hillary Loss.
Love it!
Not only are you dishonest & promoting a biased FALSE story but misusing taxpayer resources.Actual real pic
how childish

Every Dem rode the subway to Obama's inauguration. DC voted 92% for Hillary, Trump's crowd from all US.
Cannot even provide a picture at inauguration. I was there and this is fake news
Here's the real picture on who showed up at trump's Inauguration!
and were they taken at same time of day?????
HOW ABOUT YOU DO SOME REAL WORK
That was not appropriate to ask his nominee at hearings.He had NOTHING to do with that row.(I'm a dem,btw)
@flowerpower69 @RepMickMulvaney #HillaryClinton inauguration crowd.  Zero.  Nada. Nothing. #InaugurationDay #trumpwins
The pic used for Trump was the same pic used well before the inauguration. Now what was that about reality?
You know Republicans lie when they take pledges, right? Never quit Jeff!
Honesty is always the best policy, Senator.
Brilliant. Let's not acquiesce to kleptofascist unreality: https://medium.com/@Elamika/see-no-evil-7a05cd77778c#.4dol2d7gy …
@BeachPeanuts @RepMickMulvaney There is NO Rethuglican I would EVER trust. Lying traitors one and all.
@BeachPeanuts @RepMickMulvaney THE ONLY REASON IS THEIR HARD TO SEE 
imagine that, fake news from a dipshit democratic senator
@CNN gigapixel shows this picture is a fake
kudos for standing up today! Loved the pic!
love it!!
are there time stamps for those images?
Thank you Senator Merkley.  You do us proud!
Haha! Thank YOU Senator!
I've seen hundreds of pics from that crowd so yes, there could be several different opinions based on pics
All well & good to use photos, but there's no action here! You work for the people! Do something about it!
#IronMaiden
SenMerkley so glad I voted for you right now, would do so again in a heartbeat
I am proud of my Senator!
You need "We the people's" voices to stand behind you in choirs; as you speak for us. Gather our voices!
do you pledge to use REAL photos of the max crowd size instead of ones taken early?
Head back in sand please

Grow up, Senator.
