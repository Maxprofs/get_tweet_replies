Instead of giving billions to 1% -should give some to PR quickly.Why is pres waiting til next week to visit?does not have to go to send help
I friends still on the USCG down their helping. Ports have to be cleared and drivers need to be found. With that not all roads are cleared.
Bring PR 21st century infrastructure. It could be a world-changing opportunity.
What can congress do? Build a bridge? Those who can, do. Those who can't,  criticise!
If these were any other Americans, help would have been there the day after the hurricane. Stop treating them as 2nd class citizens. @POTUS

they are americans too! what about them?
Where is the general that straightened out New Orleans after Katrina? Or better yet, put the Coast Guard in charge.  Always 1st to help.
#TrumpHelpPuertoRicoNOW
Please do NOW. President obviously more interested in giving billions to richest and fighting with NFL.
Read this morning those hospitals are only open on limited basis.
@Skepmi Could PR gov ask for a ship with military vehicles&manpower 2 transport aid inland? - air drops to targeted areas?
Military is airlifting supplies. It's helping. But there are 3K containers sitting, unrefrigerated medicine - no inland coordination of this
Need troops, trucks, road clearing equip, generators, gas, diesel! Unreal diff-7 days and conditions worse! Trump is ignoring-no directions
It's really all your fault , not Trumps. You didn't help them prepare in advance. Maybe you can do better next time.
Why isn't congress doing something about having having that orange clown impeached?
Why isn't the military there? They could drop supplies like they do in so many other places! These are Americans in need,now!!
And in all this, Trump admin is taking private jets! Remember, @SpeakerRyan is totally fine with Trump—all while US citizens perish. 
You should have watched press briefings today, instead easier to yell do nothing write a check out
Totally agree. Sounds like tons of supples are there, but not getting distributed. Can you folks waive Jones Act? Call right officials?
Jones act only allows foreign ships to help. They don't have ports open to support ships. Supplies and military are there already
Um, you're in Congress. What are you doing about it? You talk like it's other people. You are the other people. Stop tweeting, take action.
Why don't you find the 500M you lost for Haiti earthquake victims and use it Jeffie ? And you fools want a raise. More BS !!
No, that's communism, they need to let the free market take its course.
I'm embarrassed that America has neglected other Americans. It's atrocious!! And sad!
to bad they should change bldg codes. why should i in oregon pay for them?
And they have not even begun to recover bodies yet. This will be gut retching.
Why were they not better prepared?  Who is running that country?  Why?
Repeal the #JonesAct
How about of Congress stays in session until you pass legislation making the military get down there and get a 4-star in charge
Word that I received our of PR is that the military coordinate its part, but no one's overseeing & coordinating 3K containers' dispersal
Because there's no Blackhawks 5K trucks or Logistics specialist on the ground
How many MILLIONAIRES in Trump's Admin sent their private planes to help our citizens in Puerto Rico? They travel on taxpayer funds anyway.
Did you get on a plane to PR and go help?  Probably not but you could instead of criticizing.
Have U heard from ur family? Do you knw anything? I'm in WPB/FL. & we r funding a prvate fndation that has been sending rescue missions 2 PR
They are acting.
Why would they?  It isn't there family or Trump's.  What's the rush.  Then when all hell breaks loose, Trump will criticize them.
But will sit on their lazy asses and just bitch instead.   You and Wyden are good at it
Congress & Trump acting as deplorables yet again. Think Flint, Michigan!
POTUS is busy at annoying black of NBA and NFL who are taking knee
#PuertoRicoRelief 
#TakeTheKnee
Its going 2 hav 2 b a world effort 2 help them I don't C how USA can pay 4 ALL the damage all these hurricanes has caused All U give urWages
Unclear why the loss of 250k homes is a highlight. Must be plenty more poor in need? Not just the 250k home owners.
Think when ppl listen 2the news they hear 1/2 & just what they want They said it was days B4  could get close 2 them & power will b months
A  Kansas City gourp has been sendin supplies water ppl &help boxes Was 1 of the 1st 1s in They found a way If they can others can TakesTime
Yeah, don't bother mentioning #USVI

US citizens! 2 hurricanes & waiting THREE weeks!

#USVirginIslands #StJohn #StThomas #StCroix
Well SENATOR...get to work on it.
You're in Congress... act!
But football players and taking away heathcare from 30+ million is bae
Why do the Republicans want American citizens to die? I'm afraid I know the answer.
What are you doing to get them on it?  And WHY hasn't Congress completed the 25th Amendment so this shit STOPS! Orange Ass is mentally ill.
What was the open hospital % before the storm? People were already being turned away and we haven't done jack. #maybenow?
NOW is the perfect time for a clean, sustainable energy model grant! Please help make it happen!
Are Feds purposely slowing down distribution? How can they quickly aid Tex, Fla, and screw up in Puerto Rico? What's really happening here?
Congress still hasn't acted to get clean water in Flint, MI either.
PR radio reports supplies not distributed quickly, due to poor planning, lack trucks & fuel! Feds creating red tape, & poorly communicating!
PR needs full statehood. They need a vote and they deserve the full support of govt. if they don't get it from us they will from Russia. 
it's an absolute shame they have to be told this, they should know. they're politicians, they work for us 
They need to fly in truck drivers that can get those shipping containers out to the people.
my husband's company is in Puerto Rico. Happy to see you are NOW saying something. Thank you.
They are. My cousin is in the US ARMY and he is being deployed there for 6 months!
AGREED!!!!
Thank you Senator!
Hey Sen Merkley, I called about this on Monday. Thank you for advocating for this issue.
The heat is becoming practically unbearable without air conditioning, gas is running out, food is running out. Pharmacies are closed
So does Trump.  He is not doing a "great" job in PR, or much of anywhere else.
Congress needs to #impeach the on the grounds he broke Oath of Office to protect ALL citizens of the United States. #SavePuertoRicoNow
@VP  hurry up
Military commander to take over. Just like LA, the resolve of our military is better organized than FEMA.
How are you helping? What can we do to help you?
Senate & House must pressure WH for a genl. to coordinate, to drop Jones Act (too bad for shipping cos.), etc. Katrina-level incompetence!
I call on u & all members to remove @realDonaldTrump who is derelict in his duties, putting 3.5 mill Americans at risk. #SavePuertoRicoNow
And where is Trump?  Oh that’s right.  U can’t drive a truck to PR and it’s in the Atlantic.  But he’s doing great and getting great reviews
Definitely yes! No question asked! Any idea to reach out to Congresses on Twitter?
No one in the US should ever have to beg for basic survival needs!
This is unforgivable. 
Wrong on hospitals and number of homes September 27 Aid Update for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands http://www.simmins.org/Site2017/wordpress/september-27-aid-update-for-puerto-rico-and-the-virgin-islands/ …
What are you telling us for.  Do you realise who Congress is?
Republicans are too busy trying to cut taxes for rich even more
No, no, no. Tax cuts for billionaires while increasing taxes for working families must take precedence over American lives. Right GOP...?
Congress needed to act last week.
@SpeakerRyan American lives more important than taxes, no??
Congress and WH should have acted days ago this is un-American
Acting fast... That's something politicians only do when it helps them keep their job.
SO, tell the Pres. tell the rest of congress.  Tweeting to the peanut gallery accomplishes less than ZERO.  STEP UP AND SCREAM IT LOUD.
Well then let’s repeal the Jones act that is delaying ships
And you @DebraMessing are most likely out shopping for more frivolous jewelry #hypocrisy
And yet the main focus is on NFL players taking a knee
No HIS main focus is NFL players-the rest of us r desperate watching Puerto Rico suffer as the ASSHOLE in charge of our country does nothing
NOW
This is the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen. The US Army needs to send five k trucks tankers and Blackhawks now
Please work diligently to help these Americans. The WH is doing nothing. They need that Jones Act suspended. http://THEY.NEED.HELP.NOW 
You should of acted days ago like everything else in Washington f... up
What’s the hold up? @gop @SpeakerRyan
https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/09/23/federal-government-moving-resources-support-puerto-rico-and-us-virgin …
Why, in this day and age, is this a question?? What are the conversations on the HILL and who is NOT in 45's face about this?????
If Senators worked in the private sector, they'd be fired for their incompetence. We need term limits.
Thank you, Senator Merkley! Nine days into this I still have not been to speak to my parents.
Are you not Congress??!  Get to work instead of resisting everything.
I just found out about The Jones Act of 1920, crippling the PR economy & enslaving the ppl. That needs to end. What can you do?
At least @POTUS is helping.
Briefed @POTUS @realDonaldTrump in #SituationRoom and thanked him for his leadership, quick response & commitment to our people  
Did the hurricane blow all of your solar panels away?
So what are you doing?
@odinpie @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr #JonesAct #JonesAct #JonesAct #JonesAct #JonesAct #JonesAct #JonesAct
Why doesn't the military help with helicopters to bring in supplies till the port is open. Chinook helicopters can cary a shit load.
Will Mitch McConell bring anything to the floor?
Puerto Rico , sadly, not white enough for trump to help
What kind of organizers could support off grid restoration of life support where FEMA won't get for weeks? Tents, water  catchment, solar ..
Trump is too busy tweeting abt NFL players kneeling
This is what happens when the country elects a President who doesn’t know he is President of Puerto Rico. We have an education problem in this country. When have a Presidential problem in this country.
Please do whatever you can to get them help 
Why the hell don't they send our construction divisons Sea Bee's. We have built airstrips and total bases every war . They are Americans
Are you cosponsoring the bill to suspend the Jones Act and the FEMA matching funds?
I appreciate you raising the issue. Recommend trying to get on radio/TV to magnify it even more
But we need to repeal the estate tax and do other cuts that will cost trillions over time.
How many displaced Puerto Ricans can Oregon accommodate? I'm happy to share my home. #GodhelpPuertoRico #WeCanBeTheMiracle
Wait a sec. @realDonaldTrump said everything in PR was going very well, thanks to him. #TrumpLies
So what are you going to do.
What we're shocked that you actually propose to do some work. About time.
You don't need a DHS waiver. #RepealJonesActNow
Sorry, but black men are kneeling and billionaires need a tax break.
Lol. #Priorities
omg, this is unbearable.
