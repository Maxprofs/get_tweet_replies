@SenWarren @SenJeffMerkley Thank you for reading Mrs. King's letter.
thank you! 
Thank you Emily! Part of what makes Feast great is its heart.
why don't you try working WITH the current administration.. to inprove the outcome for everyone.. then you could help Oregon
I'm pretty sure the majority of voters who voted against 45 would want @SenJeffMerkley to do exactly what he's doing.
I want him to attend to the needs of Oregonians.. THAT is what he was elected to do..
I agree with you there. I don't agree that Sessions is the right person. I'm happy @SenJeffMerkley is concerned on my behalf.
I respect your right to your opinion.. but I am afraid I am not of the same persuasion.. and I think..
Jeff Merkley has been looking out for Jeff Merkley since he was a snot nosed kid in Mrytle Point
. @SenJeffMerkley I appreciate your parliamentary queries. #rule19 we need the truth in the record. #stopsessions
