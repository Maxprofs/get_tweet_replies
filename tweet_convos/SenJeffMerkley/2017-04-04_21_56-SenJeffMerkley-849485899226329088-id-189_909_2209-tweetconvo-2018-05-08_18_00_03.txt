That's why he got approved last time in a bi partisan vote.  You're just a stooge for Chuck Schumer  another partisan hack.
And Garland wasn't? ... Do you think all appellate ct judges approved that way should then get a free pass to the sup ct?
I think the Dems are manufacturing outrage and smearing the man. Felt Garland should have gotten a hearing not upset he didn't  tho #pro2ndA
"Manufacturing" outrage? The GOP flatly refused to let Obama fill a sup ct seat & said they would continue for 4 years under HRC.
Dems would have filibustered anyone Trump nominated.  Thank Harry Reid for today.  Blame hyper partisanship on both sides.  I voted Gary J
BTW, did your dude ever figure out what is Alleppo? ... His VP nominee didn't even vote for him, right?
Aleppo wouldn't be in the news if Obama had learned lessons of Bush's Middle East regime change. Confident GJ would appt Solid cabinet.
Ah. Johnson's ignorance of major world events was Obama's fault for not preventing those events.
Yes I'm very concerned about the impact his anti-women views will have on reproductive rights.  He should not be confirmed.
Thanks for framing and filling it all in last night. It was a presentation that I think should have overwhelmed Republicans with its truth.
Thank you for your effort!
Thank you for representing us so faithfully and tirelessly.  #holdthefloor
When they should be concerned about your far left idiotology!
Thank you
Thank you!It's wonderful to know there are some Senators who actually care about their constituents.I wish I were that lucky(from OK, sadly)
Right? TX here we have zero shot of having a senator listen unless you buy them off.... Hopefully @BetoORourke. Will change that in 2018
Unfortunately @SenateGOP doesn't give a damn about women....
TY #steelyspined Rep! Need you to transform the rest of the Dems-#steelspine transplants. Sometimes 1 has 2 to do what is right #TakeAStand
We might be concerned if he was actually an extremist. Unfortunately for you, he is not.
complete bullsh!t and you know it
Americans don't really care about a Supreme Court judge...they DO care about a #psychoinchief and Russia.
Be proud of your legacy @SenJeffMerkley. It will stand the test of time.
Got to love this man, he stands up for "We the People"!!

Thanks for your help and support.
Not only a stolen seat, but a paid for nomination by a political donor-thank you for representing what is right
Really? More so than Scalia? Yes Garland shooda gotten vote and yes we SHOULD have had betterPOTUS choices - pick a better fight
Thank you, Senator. We're behind you. Keep fighting the good fight for us, we need you!
He is not for us!
#holdthefloor please. He is not fit to be SCOTUS. Remember Garland.  #Resist #Resistance #NoProbeNoRobe
Hold the floor Senator, we are behind you. Stolen seat! Gorsuch toooo
far right, supports corporations over citizens
Thank you! #StopGorsuch
#MerrickGarland
Thank you!
Really?
I'm and American and I'm not "concerned". I appreciate a judge who rules based on law and does not legislate from the bench.
Keep persisting!!!
thank you
Thank you, Senator!
Please continue! Thank you
Thank YOU Senator!
Thank you for standing up for Americans who see that Gorsuch is too extreme to be on the Court. He puts Corps over people & is anti-worker.
#NoGorsuch -- a total corporatist who would never dream of overturning #CitizensUnited. 
remember #MerrickGarland
Go Jeff! You are right & we support you
♡
Yes. #HoldTheFloor   #NoGorsuch   
and remember #MerrickGarland
You have the blood of children on your hands!
If you're pro choice you do!
Liar!
How about reading the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Amendments aloud?
Americans are concerned about Merkley's extreme, far-left, anti-originalist, anti-progress record - and Senate should be too.
Thank you!
I'm an American and I'm not concerned one bit. Because it's HORSE SHIT! Liberalism is a mental disorder. #NuclearOption
Keep up the fight @SenJeffMerkley!
Thank you! No to Gorsuch! Dems resist!
Proud of you, Senator! Thanks for all that you are explaining about why Gorsuch is a poor choice. Wish I'd tuned in earlier. #holdthefloor
As one of your constituents, thank you Senator.
We are with you! Thank you!
He is heartless, too; apart from wanting to legislate! I wish many of those things had happened to him! Privileged & biased like Trump!
Hold the floor, sir!
amazing. Oregon stands with you!!!
Thank you Senator  
GORSUCH HAS A 97% CONFIRMATION RECORD, WHICH MEANS THE LEFT APPOINTED JUDGES AGREED WITH HIM 97% OF THE TIME! THIS IS A FACT. #partisanbs
Thank you for making this Oregonian proud!
Americans have read Judge #Gorsuch's decisions, and are mildly amused by your lies about him, @SenJeffMerkley. #Twitterbuster
Thank you, sir! Your efforts are appreciated!! #StolenSeat

Thank you @SenJeffMerkley!
s to you, Senator Merkley!! 
The Left:We must fight DJT for perceived transgressions on the Constitution
Also The Left:We must fight Gorsuch for being aConstitutionalist
The Right: We must strip the rights of everyone who is not a white Christian male #holdthefloor
If the Right from Ford to GW Bush is anything to go by, they made no efforts to do any such thing. 

As for your skin color: IDK;IDC.
That's delusional... sorry other reply was not meant for you... just recently started "trolling"
Twitter's new reply system autotags people.As for your entrance to trolling, prepare to be carried over the threshold and into the dumpster.
I am a faster learner. Are you going to call me a snowflake or a libtard anytime soon?
Keep it up, @SenJeffMerkley!! Sending you strength, as you fight the good fight!! This 'Sconniegirl appreciates what you're doing!
Thank you, Senator! We will sleep better tonight in #Beaverton #Oregon knowing you're fighting for us.
All Americans need to be reminded. This is not just about #Gorsuch's qualifications. This is also about a STOLEN nomination.
Thank you for holding the floor!
Thank you for having the courage of our convictions. It's a stolen seat. No reward for bad behavior.
You can quote Seuss too: “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, Nothing is going to get better. It's not.” The Lorax.
Thank you for speaking up
