The eclipse is now total in Oregon.  A celestial event you see once or twice in a lifetime.  The shadow of the Moon is now covering Oregon.

@realDonaldTrump, making eclipse great again.
Waiting to hear how many ppl didn't use proper eye protection. #business for #ophthalmologists
It's kinda bizarre. We pollute our planet but then stop to admire a planetary event. Strange parasites we are.
Moonbows and Moonbeams 
We had a partial one and was amazed but you guys got the total solar eclipse - God's universe is beyond words 
Wonderful!
Did we get any footage of the dark side of the moon?
maanaaaaaa
Why did you guys use your weather changing chemicals to block my view at the last second
That is awesome thank you @NASA
Just speechless!
I witnessed this incredible event in Gallatin and I'm still in shock. What an incredible experience, words can't describe the wonder!  
The corona was breathtaking! Six of us about fell out of our lawn chairs in amazement!
Beatiful
This is science. If POTUS believes this, good. "Money makes the world go around, the world go around." Convince me.

You are talking about this right
اشهد ان لا اله الا الله وان محمدا رسول الله
The eclipse of the sun reminds me of how fragile humans are..and considering the big picture (of the fragile earth) how stupid we are.
اللهم اغفر لنا خطأنا
رحماك رحماك يا الله
Watching on MSNBC. This so cool. Emotions bouncing all over the place.
Is it possible to have vidio of path of eclipse across America from space station or satellites ?
Underwhelming so far in northeast, thanks NASA for allowing me to enjoy it.
So it's not on East coast but still awesome, Thanks NASA
Amazing.
U guys have the best view of all, umm I should be jealous, well I'm kinda. Hmmm
You going crazy for an eclipse caused by moon! Soon I will show you an eclipse caused by the earth!

@DebnamCarey  
Proves science is real
@MiliZavarra
MO dropped the ball on what they showed in their live feed. Coming out of eclipse? Yes, show us people putting glasses back on.
@nasa Is possible to have a nationwide totality solar eclipse where every state can see a total eclipse?
#ImpeachTrump. Nature reacts to bad energy waves emitted by #IdiotDonaldTrump. #NASA involved in cover up by tweeting ridiculous explanation
@lolmorgann
It looked like an engagement ring
@YildaGzz
Woah
Incredible.
So Awesome wish I was there. Still waiting for our 8o% coverage
spectacular
socked in Sonoma CA thx for the  live stream
Will we see celestial bodies that are behind the sun as predicted by Einstein? #SolarEclipse17
Desde Argentina ,Sudamerica.
U send solar eclipse vedio for me
Daughter cut her eclipse glasses in half so I can watch while she's at school. So thoughtful
L'eclisse
@NASA question -- why do smartphones not need an eclipse filter? My teen is asking...
Because cameras doesn't have retina cells
Awesome 
someone told me that the sun will never come back... Is this true? I am worried for the grass.
Wow amazing!
Can't get your live feed to load, even on wifi.  Very disappointed.
Too Cool!!
It was so incredible to experience it first hand!!!!!!!
Awesome views
Can't wait to totality we are 1/3 of the way there. #SolarEclipse #eclipse
Ready for it.

#SolarEclipse2017
First glimpse of #SolarEclipse2017 totality in Oregon! Take a look here and watch our live stream for more: http://www.nasa.gov/eclipselive  
Allah is greatest!!!!
@NASA excited to see solar eclipse today.  my 6 year old has question on how the eclipse goes from west to east.
Give son a flashlight. You lie down holding a ball/hat. Have him put the light near his feet. Have him lift over the hat and pass beyond it
This has literally been the best day of my life #SolarEclipse
You guys rock!  Please continue to inspire our forward thinking youth who have dreams for our future!  #SolarEclipse2017
God's amazing creation. Sun is 400 times larger than the moon but 400 times further away, creating this amazing event! Not a coincidence.
Thank you NASA
Awesome
Good job NASA
Amazing!!

White House sources say #Trump CRAZIER than the public thinks.What??
#TheResistance #25thAmendment #CNN #MSNBC #bbcnews 
May we all find our best selves and shine above dar.
Interesting side effect with those witnessing it live gaining clarity in life & asking, "Why hasn't @GOP impeached their crooked leader"?
Oregons been in the dark for a long time now. Getting worse than CA with all the Libs.

Why was the founder of JPL/NASA an occultist?  Do you trust satanic occultists?
I am sorry because in my country is not a total eclipse
