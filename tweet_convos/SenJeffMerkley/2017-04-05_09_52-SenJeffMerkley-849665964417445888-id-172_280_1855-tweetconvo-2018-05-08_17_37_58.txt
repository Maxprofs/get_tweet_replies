So what did your grandstanding accomplish? So you think gorsuch is more con than those 2 harpies were liberal?
Democrts are pathetic obstructionist's with no real argument that Gorsich is not qualified,
honey & lemon in tea. Don't talk much (and don't feel bad about it) for a couple weeks. Rest your voice. 
You are my hero Jeff. Been involved in politics since 1967, and you're one of the VERY few who stand 4 truth. Donated via Act Blue today....
Thank you for taking a "stand" against a stolen SCOTUS seat. Well done.

Senator, we all thank you for your hard work- I do not know how you do it! You also deserve a great meal and a foot massage, at least!

When the next democratic president nominates a Supreme Court justice some Republican senator will follow your bullshit example.
thank you for your dedication. I was impressed by your professionalism during 15 hours of filibuster. Well done!!!
Thank You @SenJeffMerkley from a constituent
Poor guy, I hope he gets a lot of sleep after this!
I'm guessing they needed to run the air conditioning the whole time due to the massive amounts of hot air.
@DaveAdams27 and this man is one of many reasons why we should move to Oregon asap
Thank you, Senator. You're like the energizer bunny.
You've earned it, Senator
