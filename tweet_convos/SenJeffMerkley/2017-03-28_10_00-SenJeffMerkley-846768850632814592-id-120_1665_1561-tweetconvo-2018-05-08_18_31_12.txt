By trying to roll back #CleanPowerPlan, @realDonaldTrump is tragically pushing our nation back – w/ job losses, sicker kids, & wasted tax $$
#CleanPowerPlan has set ambitious yet achievable goals to protect our health and communities, all while creating jobs in growth industries.
Koch Brothers, Big Oil and Gas win, our kids lose. Who would you side with?
GOP/Trump assumes only poor people will die from bad air, rising water & heat.  They haven't heard of tides & trade winds.
@Syr829 
New jobs. In Healthcare
@fireheather Trump secret plan no 102... make big pharmacy execs richer by making people sicker thus requiring more drugs.
That does sound like a plan he would enact.
@realDonaldTrump If you truly cared about people, you wouldn't have done this. You lie, deflect, misdirect, to hide the fact YOU DON'T CARE
@SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake @azcentral WHY DO GOP HATE US CITIZENS??
@nudlesoop  Nice job @POTUS my daughter has severe asthma. Sad!
Trump is destroying our country and our future one EO at a time. Why is it taking so long to impeach
I have no idea, I would like to ask 1 of the Attorneys in my office but they ALL drink Trump KoolAide 
that must totally suck!
are you set up not to receive private messages?
I don't know I think I can get them?
I tried again and I get an error message that your account doesn't accept messages
Folks who risk their lives to mine coal should know #DontheCon tried to eliminate their lifetime healthcare in O-care repeal
@dperry913 Suppose King DT holds pharm stock in Albuterol? Someone should tell him smog drifts into gated communities, too.
Bingo. None of them care, they live in a total fantasy world that looks like a Monopoly board.
on the bright side, jobs for doctors, nurses, home healthcare will increase!
Absolutely cruel heartless
@SenateDems More scare tactics
My child has asthma. ONE inhaler costs $100/month with insurance. Need your "president" to witness a child having an attack!
The "Mark" of the DE***!
@AltFireAviation this is already issue for me. I hope Trumpcare comes with a Bubble and oxygen mask
Trump(doesn't) care will come with nothing.
Learn from your past, move on, grow stronger. -> @RelatabIeTweetz <-
Take a trip to India or China. You'll see what REAL pollution looks like. We will always have a cleaner environment here.
where are your numbers coming from? Nothing on CDC or Oregon Health Department!
@LeslieMarshall scare tactics by Dems. This act not needed. Clean was already here b4 Obama
Where does your data come from. Source?
@Timmbarton123T 

#Republicans LOVE killing Americans more than isis.

Imagine if jihadists tried to kill so many citizens
Imagine the reaction if jihadists killed 3,600 American children per year. 1,000 more than 9/11 every year
Tens of thousands of people are dead because of Democrats' mileage standards forcing smaller cars onto the roads.
The biggest threat to the environment is overpopulation, but Jeff Merkley wants continued mass immigration.
Illegal aliens kill thousands of Americans. Jeff Merkley wants to let them stay and invites more in.
~ #DTs response: "Jobs 4 Medical Drs & Undertakers. Jobs R what I make! Quit bitching"!
States ready to sue and people will resist.
@SenateDems What do u think the Ammonia in the air now due to DEF liquid is doing thanks to the Cal EPA restrictions?
@Jcombs27516 maybe that's how Trump intends to "create" jobs: by letting people die needlessly.
once again Trump voters pretty much said screw you to their own children
These people are sick. And I mean the GOP.
#Propaganda #FakeNews Fear mongering nonsense. "Boogah boogah".
Trump isn't content with destroying democracy,
he wants to destroy the planet
Can you share this on FB please?
And they  celebrate "explosion" of ACA. Dangerously small-picture w/long term consequences for our children and our planet.
That's a false narrative my kids have asthma....Maybe smokers should stop smoking but that's their choice
There is no upside to play a climate change denier mindset.  Worst case, we have jobs, tech, and renewable energy.
But...but...at signing ceremony, Trump said "we're gonna have clean coal...really clean coal"! LOL
...then help us FIGHT Senator.
Please share @SenJeffMerkley to PRESERVE #CleanPowerPlan
@eugene_warmoth Yet, Trump will devastate the environment AND not plan on covering basic medical needs for those impacted.
Seriously, @SenJeffMerkley how is this happening in our country and what can we do to stop it?
@SenateDems and greater national debtcould mean no money for healthcare anyway
@epa public health should be more imp than quick profit. Preserve the Clean Power Act. It is right.
Nice "Could" story. OK, here's another one: Singing the national anthem in Italian could entice a crow to crap on your head.
The GOP pro-life plan-miscarriages instead of abortions.
#GOPpsychopaths #GOPdeathcult
@puppymnkey they don't care, it saves corporations money
@MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @senrobportman @boblatta @sengraham2016  Unite country DT/GOP? Ha! Breathe death
Congrats, Trump supporters. You must be so proud . #CleanPowerPlan
@SenateDems I heard it COULD mean 1 billion more asthma attacks and 1 trillion  more premature deaths
Oppose the LNG pipeline in Southern Oregon!
@SenateDems Bull
"Could."  Any proof?  Or just bluster.
I agree. What are we gonna do Sen? What's the message that will help 50% of Americans c what the rest of world does already?
@SenSanders Healcare is a right. Support Bernie's #Medicare4All Legislation #StillSanders
Senator, would you support American Lung Association class action against EPA/Trump over this on behalf of us asthmatics?
LIARS! HATEFILLED Democrats always LIE! You just make up these numbers! DEMOCRATS are BABY KILLERS thru abortion
The GOP doesnt care about pollution effects on we the people.
Whine.
@MalcolmNance This could be called criminal, endangering the health of children!There should be a class action by asthmatics
Are you using actual facts or the #AlternativeFacts the Dems like to pile on us over here on the right... #MAGA
.@SenJeffMerkley @SenateDems #Trump must be prosecuted for endangering the lives of our children, he will be held for responsible. Fight on
@SenateDems and so much more... allergy sufferers will be worse. Republicans still caring about themselves and no one else
i dont care about my  self but its funny all demorcats are swj who wanna be politically correct
I guess the GOP is cool with Beijing and New Delhi's air quality? Will masks become fashion statements here, too?
Hope not, though I would be happy to see them become expected here if you have a cold, etc
Don't forget all the senior citizens who have breathing problems. This will only magnify those issues.
Climate change denialist fossil fuel execs to become Tobacco execs of the 21st century.
Until a powerful Repub's kid,grandkid dies from a dirty air asthma attack, they'll continue gleefully destroying the planet.
@MalcolmNance trump is an abomination. Usher in the environmental apocalypse. Wake up America. This can't stand.
@Khanoisseur .@thehill Trump knows coal is dead; refuses to invest in #cleanpowerplan.  All for $$ to his friends.
@MalcolmNance This is what I'm afraid of. I knw lots of folks w horrible allergy-related asthma mostly caused by air quality
Bullshit!
The #CleanPowerPlan was a hidden, regressive tax on consumers. President Trump is right to repeal it. https://twitter.com/Heritage/status/846793926283612160 …
Who cares about kids as long as old fat guys get even richer!
@MalcolmNance Trump. Is. A. Devil
@MalcolmNance not 1 Republican believes U or gives a shit...remember that next time you meet one
Oh, we'll all remember those who voted for evil.
@MalcolmNance Only black children in the Dangerous Inner City die of asthma attacks. What's the problem?
And are trying to get us to believe cutting spending on policies will save money?!?!? They're hiking defense spending!!! No savings!
And these Repubs keep spewing lies about PP paying for abortions!
@Khanoisseur thanks for the info. But what are you &'colleagues going to do to fight it?
COPD meds ~ $250/mo; Asthma inhalers: up to ~$150/mo.
25% of child deaths are from pollution.
@MalcolmNance Not good for heart disease
@Khanoisseur Check how many COPD patients are in the U.S. Literally deadly for them,too.
HOW do we stop this maniac?
@Khanoisseur Yeah asthma is not a respector of political parties.
Why in God's name, do we have a Russian Linked Nutcase making Decisions???
huh? Clinton paid 500 grand to speak at Russian event.  They not in office
Thanks to Trump, my daughter has a lousy medical future.  She has asthma.
@Khanoisseur Bad for folks will COPD or any other lung issues and the elderly.
Keep fighting.  Being able to breathe is worth it. I remember flying into LAX in the bad ol' days.
stop talking about climate (half the US thinks it's a lie), start talking about pollution (everyone agrees pollution sucks)
Yep. Gotta keep it simple.
my son has asthma. this is a huge setback!
I am an adult with recent diagnosis of asthma. It hurts all humans. Hurts our planet.
Especially my lungs
@Khanoisseur   Isn't convenient that we are cutting CDC which would track this kind of stuff.
Does Trump realize that is will affect trust fund babies in golden towers as well?
@Khanoisseur Yup.
@Khanoisseur soon to be like China yay!!! Vomits a little bit in mouth
@Khanoisseur 
"could mean" is that how you legislate
wrong PP only cares about money
Driving past the Boardman coal power plant trigger terrible and frightening asthma attacks.
Is Trump's only agenda is to repeal every good action President Obama took??
yes, he legacy should be wiped away
profits
thank you for highlighting the health consequences of these actions. Especially given they want to dismantle health care.
all the more reason that Democrats need to run better candidates and win elections for a change.
