Thank you for being a stalwart warrior in defense of Obamacare!
Not saying "thank you" until its fixed.  Now get to work and stop your incessant whining. ACA is not sustainable!
A healthcare program that is not sustainable is a failure. Obummer & all Congressman should have ACA for their family insurance.
Thank you for defending us, Senator Merkley!

Thank you, Senator-- for standing up for Oregonians and Americans. 
Please your faux outrage not helpful as we have a failing healthcare system all owned by you and #senatedems.
No different than when Obama Crammed Obamacare down our throats without one Republican vote. Now lets see Obamacare crash!
So you've never heard of Obamacare? Huh.
There's never been a bill more deserving of being defeated â€” the process was an embarrassment to the Senate, and the substance was awful.
Thank you!
Thank you for your hard work, Senator Merkley!
