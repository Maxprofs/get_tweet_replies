Thank you sir!!!!
Thank you Senator Merkley!  Hold onto those amendments.  The zombie bill may rise again.
Thank you Senator!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley  #Oregon
Thank you Senator Merkley for all that you have done for us.
Proud to call you my senator. Glad you didn't need to use them tonight.
Proud to have you fighting for us Oregonians in the trenches - actually, for all Americans. #WarriorForDemocracy
That's just it, you battle for the few in your view and not the whole your are responsible for. Put congress on Obamacare! I dare you!!
Senator Merkley, we should work together to make a decent affordable health care. That's what democracy is about.
You seem to work around the clock! Thank you for representing Oregonians.
My Senators rock. Go Oregon!
Lucky. I get that cadaver Lankford.
You have a project to work on :)
Trying  I live in a county with very few dems, and one progressive 
Fighting the good fight. Thank you.
Thanks Jeff for fighting for me. I need you to take it to the next level.
Amendments for what?
Please stop wasting our money and your time and do something productive..
Senator, thank you for fighting for me!

THANKS JEFF! GLAD I VOTED FOR YOU!

Single-payer
You are the best- proud of my @SenJeffMerkley
With these ammendments, did you include how to pay for each and every one?
....that's not the law, He is...* prepare for that... loose those chains from him, from his heart... that he may know his arms are empty . Z

This shouldn't be a battle. Everyone SHOULD BE on the same side. Let's call it a process.
Thank you for all your work for all these years Senator Merkley. You have my full support.
Get THEM!!! Thank you Senator!! Keep fighting for OUR healthcare!!
No it is not.  Anarchy rules and must be anihilated, not stopped, anihilated.  Thr is more than most know.
So proud...And no wonder, you're one of the top 100 in an entity (govt.) that really sucks at doing things, but can't stop trying! Pathetic.
Thank you for working for Oregonians and all Americans!! #RetainAndReplace.
committee process--public hearings--60 votes, not 51. From @ASlavitt
#HumaneBeingsUnited!!! @SenSanders @davidsirota @DNC @GOP
Thank you Senator Merkley! Please keep fighting!
You're submitting amendments to a document you claim you have never  seen. Still playing people for fools I see.  #IdiotSenator
You have done an awesome job and I look forward to bipartisanship to work on the ACA to improve!!!!!
Thanks
You are the Mensch!
Thank you, Senator!
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Merkley!
This man has never had a real job. Has lived off us tax payers his whole life!!! Thanks but no thanks, can't contribute.
This Oregonian thanks you! Now please work to make affordable health care available to all! #NoSkinnyBill #HealthCareForAll

Thank you!!
Go Jeff!!!
They wanted suggestions! #merkleyed republicans will be crazy to skip on these amendments!
Thanks Jeff! (i only wish YOUR healthcare was on the line as well)
1) strip congress of healthcare. 2) Set term limits. 3) start impeachment. 4) single payer now. 5) defund DEA. 6) SNAP ELECTION.
Keep fighting.  This is an absolute disgrace.
Have you ever seen senators vote for a bill they want to fail?  This is insane.
Jeff run in 2020
Get 'em, Jeff.
Hang tough Senator
Go get 'em, Jeff! #senatorwithasoul #thisisnotnormal #resist
Thank you Senator, you're fighting for people like me whose Senators don't care
Thank you for fighting for Oregonians and all Americans
We're counting on you.
Thank you brother
Thank you!
thank you :) for all you're doing! This is life/death & a massive job loss if it goes through.
How about you start with that and end with #impeachmentpapers?
Thank you!!
Yes, yes. The amendments. Where are they?
Amendment: If you opt out of insurance, you must give up your right of healthcare in any form.
Amendment: Males who opt out of insurance have to give up sex with females due to the need for healthcare of possible pregnancy.
So grateful to you for fighting the good fight! Thousands of Oregon families like mine are counting on you
Please fight for us all. We're counting on you. Goddess bless.
Fight for us.
Please implore your colleagues to stop this madness. This is not democracy. People if they pass this we must take to the streets!
Every senator + house member should be required to maintain the cheapest plan available in their states after waiver... Save federal money!
thank you
Represent Oregon Jeff and stand against this terrible process!
Thank you for fighting for us! @SenJeffMerkley
Please please please!
