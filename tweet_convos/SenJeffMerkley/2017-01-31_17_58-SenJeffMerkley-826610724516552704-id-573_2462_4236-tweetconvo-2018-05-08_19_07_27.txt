It's not a stolen seat.  The senate had every right to block Obama.
Then by that logic, Dems have every right to block Trump?
No.  What Dems are doing is unprecedented and wrong.
Unprecedented? HAHAHA. The GOP held the SC seat vacant for a whole YEAR! The hypocrisy is astounding!
They let obama have his fucking cabinet.  Dems even let Bush have his.
Obama won by an ACTUAL landslide. Obama had a near SUPER MAJORITY in the senate.
Obama entered office with an 83% approval rating. But most importantly, Obama nominated QUALIFIED PEOPLE.
So yes, they let Obama have his fucking cabinet. He had an ACTUAL mandate.
. @SenJeffMerkley THANK YOU for all you are doing to oppose the horror of this administration. I have lived in OR for 5.5 years & I'm PROUD!
Hi Alana please explain why you disagree with this nomination.... Very interested in your opinion.  Really I am!
1. Wasn't their seat to fill in the 1st place. 2. Hobby Lobby 3. Anti-abortion 4. Anti-euthanasia = anti-FREEDOM
won't even attempt to argue that but I do hear you and I appreciate your passion!
Thank you for being respectful.
Respect is all we have anymore!  Sad to see the way things have gone.... So when do you believe life begins?
this is what I think and others can decide differently, because it's THEIR life/choice: not mine.
to further the conversation.... At this point I'm really at a loss for solution!!!!  Do you see what I am seeing?
the GOP blocked Garland. Ever heard the phrase, 'turnabout is fair play'?
lame duck. And when you lose, you don't get to choose.
Presidents get 4 years, regardless of party. Reagan got Kennedy.
True. But he wasn't voted during lame duck session.
not wrong. That is exactly what I said.  Lame duck:no vote.
Lame duck. If you lose, you don't choose.
I don't think you understand what lame duck means...
When a seat comes open in election year..current pres.does not choose. The next elected pres. chooses.
Senator Merkley please oppose Gorsuch and #Trump's other nominees.
@Brian_Hjelle @realDonaldTrump we need to impeach this disgrace! Why have we forgotten about Russia and Comey???
@JustLolatalkin @SenJeffMerkley @Brian_Hjelle @realDonaldTrump impeachments now.
not@realDonaldTrump not listening to the constitution.
Yes! I'm Californian and GOP stole SUPREME COURT NOMINEE TO STACK HIGHEST COURT! TREASON!
don't you leftist/Marxist want to stack the court with your un-American judges?!
Amazing. You guys still just don't realize what happened in Nov do you ? WE THE PEOPLE fully support @realDonaldTrump
What can we Oregonians do to help support U in standing up for the integrity of the SCOTUS?
Made the right pick . Pretty sure @SenJeffMerkley is in his LAST TERM
You lost - aren't in the driver's seat now, thank Almighty God!  O'bama was unpatriotic, dishonest & worst!
A "far right extremist" unanimously confirmed in 2006 by the likes of Schumer, Kerry, Clinton, Obama...
Get a grip!
SCOTUS isn't voted in during election year. Don't you know anything??
Maybe ISIS pays your state a visit
THANK YOU!!!!!!
Hell yeah, Senator Merkley! You just got yourself another donor! What can we do to help?
hope your a spine and balls donor Colwill...cause Sen Merkley is in need of both.
I see public school has failed you and I'm sorry for that.
Merkley has repeatedly failed his constituents. If you care about such things.
Some maybe...not the majority.
Merkley and his party have all but destroyed this state, and all we used to stand for.
I think you are out of touch with the majority of Oregonians... I truly am sorry you feel that way.
I think you live in either the Portland MSA or Eugene, and have no idea of Oregon's real diversity.
.@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Need this Senator?

.@SenJeffMerkley
any senator who doesn't filibuster gets primaried out
thank you for standing up against Trump. This country could use more Senators like you!
you are unacceptable merkley!!!
It is not you to say who is acceptable or not, it's the congress. You are but 1 vote. It is not stolen coz it is vacant.
Oh get over yourself.  It's politics.  You would use the same tactics if the situation was reversed.
But I guess it's okay to nominate a left wing extremist? What hypocrisy!
Thank you Senator!! Keep pushing!
thanks for hearing your constituents and speaking out! #proudoregonian #resist
Jeff ye areLeft-Wing Liberal DemoncRAT and Anti-USA /Anti-Israel / and Pro-Abortion ( MURDER )!!
@ronwyden  legalized weed has scrambled the brains of Oregonians. Fundamental Constitutional Rights=Gorsuch
It is OUR seat.  Gorsuch WILL sit in it.  YOU can do nothing about it.  Have a great and blessed day!
- Thank you for fighting! Stollen.
being a constitutionalists is not being far right. I want someone who is law constitution abiding
Thank you!
Hes quite acceptable 2 65mm ppl. DEMs not only ppl in US. U wld have done exactly same if sit. reversed!
Cry us a river, #snowflake. Biden Rule ring a bell, #hypocrite? #propaganda
and btw, upholding the constitution does not make you a far right extremist, it's the sole duty and purpose of a #SCOTUS
you are pathetic. Enjoy what time you have left in the senate. @realDonaldTrump has already begun to #draintheswamp !
A farvright extremist?  Please dear God back up your name calling with some facts!!!!???  Yes that's a ?
Biden Rule
Thank you Senator!!!!
Extremist? 
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/a-jeffersonian-on-the-supreme-court/515319/ â€¦
Seriously? This from the man who encouraged the IRS to harass the Tea Party?
Too bad, libs. YOU'RE not in control, anymore. MAGA!!!
Calling a standard conservative an extremist - great way to help heal our broken nation.  Solid leadership there, statesman.
So you were going to vote against any Trump nominee. And now you actually have a name.  You are the swamp.
I don't know how u go to work without punching those CRIMINALS in the face @SenJeffMerkley! 2 seats stolen-Don't forget @HillaryClinton's!
Good luck with that blocking, let me know how that works out for you
@Indivisible_STL @realDonaldTrump Thank you! NO COMPROMISE NOSUPREME COURT W'OUT GARLAND! PERIOD!
#GARLANDTREATMENT
#RESIST
Why did 0 of your colleagues oppose him previously?
Please pick your battles. Everything does not have to be partisan warfare. Fight for what really matters!
Nothing stolen/Believe what you want. There is a winner, there is a loser/Trump is fair winner vs. HRC lost
President Trump is going to get 4 more. 2 of yours in a scandal, 2 will retire.
trump prevented civil war with conservative judge clinton was gonna take our guns and BOOM it would be on!?
Senator Enjoy Your Time In Office. If Gorsuch Is Not Confirmed We Will Replace You!
#Gorsuch4SCOTUS
Not as extremist as whacking Scalia. A Democrat's definition of extremist: Having a different opinion.
Wow this guy (Jeff) is a nut! No stolen seat (good try) - he's an excellent judge & will be confirmed
: Actually, it wasn't owned by libs, ever! Now go cry alone whiney baby.
"Far right" as in a traditional constitutionalist who'll uphold the rule of law and the 2nd amendment?
so stolen seat means you agree with @POTUS and illegal votes?

The SC nom is not an extremist. He respects the Constitution. You should try it.
never voting for you again super bummed about you Oregon guys and your disrespect of the process.

Yes, to communists like Merley a Constitution loving patriot like Gorsuch would be an "extremist."
Thank you Senator for not selling out.
@RandiRhodes you're the extremist. Elections have consequences - Barry told me that. You lost. Deal with it
.@SenJeffMerkley  Resist, yes!!  We cannot reward this coup-in-process from Trump & whichever lackeys will misguidedly join. Thank you!
IDIOT Markey Confirming Hussein's pick in the midst of election would be stealing it from American people
LOL. If the situation had been reversed, you would've been screaming BIDEN RULE!!! from the rooftops.
That's the thing about falling on your own knife.  If it happens, then nobody feels sorry for you.
BIG LIE Senator! For long time a Supreme Court vacancy during a Pres election yr was left 4 new Pres 2 fill
Very sad that Senator Merkley sees democratic strategy as "two wrongs make a right". Show some leadership Senator Merkley.
Hahahaha! Silliness just like a fifth grader.
because Obama wouldn't have nominated a "far" left judge??  And what's good for the goose...
Nuke option coming!!! Dems spiraling outta control into oblivion! Next election will double as funeral!
You come up with that yourself, or did the DNC write it for you?
LMAO...stolen? You're hilarious ðŸ–’
I distill Leftist tears to fuel my SUV. Dems days of lawlessness and destruction are over!
Dolt Forgets History .@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Biden in '92: Supreme Court Nominee Should Wait https://youtu.be/qPAzVNmOYgM  via @YouTube
Yawn, Butthurt femme corruptocrat speaks.
PLEASE get all Dem Senators to vote no, especially Feinstein!!!!
--and who do you think you are?  Get outta here you good for nothing..
Quit crying, limpdick.
Could someone on your staff research whether Garland's nomination has to be taken up 1st?
Someone who follows the Constitution as written is an extremist? Like George Washington? DUMB@$$
Thank you.
I do NOT want to be in the party of obstructionist. We are Democrats - we are better than this
no obstruction, we are the grownups. Let's act like it
no to obstruciton - fight, protest, VOTE-but I don't want to be an obstructionist. I refuse to be them
Thank you Senator Merkley! You are standing up for justice for our entire nation! #Resist
Never within 70 yrs has a Lame Duck President at the end of his term seated a SCOUTS. Ppl voted you lost.
Two words "Biden's Rule". Look it up.  Dems always crying when Reps actually hold you to your words.
.@SenJeffMerkley thank you for standing up for this. We need the rest of @SenateDems to do the same!!!
You triggered?? 
the Republicans knew since March 2016 that Trump would win? @realDonaldTrump
Get over it, this Judge will be confirmed as well he should.  #Obstructionist Democrats
Stolen seat? You would have done the same thing if situation was reversed. Don't be a self-righteous hypocrite!
Shout-outs to @SenJeffMerkley & @RonWyden for showing Oregon willnot stand forthe Racism&Treason of @POTUS
LOL!!!!  Merkley You are Wrong and you know it!!!  Lame-Duck President = NO stolen seat!!!
Thank you Senator Merkley! The Stolen Supreme Court Seat https://nyti.ms/2jEp5C2   belongs to M. Garland!
Just following the rules Biden laid out so not a 'stolen seat' #FakeOutrage #FakeNews
I am sure the I.R.S. that you used in your unethical targeting of conservative groups agree???????
THANK YOU SENATOR . Please keep fighting for the citizens whose states elected officials won't 
Please please please insist @TheDemocrats filibuster this hearing. #Resist #TrumpMakesAmericaWeak #2018PrimariesAreComing
You crying like Schumer? Maybe you'll like @POTUS' next appointment better!!
@donnabrazile @realDonaldTrump Learn history: 80 years since a lame duck in final year pushed thru a SCOTUS.
Yeah, um, no Merkley.  Enjoy your very limited time left in gov't.  You and Dems have WAY overplayed cards.
Please fight! This allows Kennedy to retire and be replaced with another far right extremist. #resist and #BanBannon
Put your big boy pants  on and suck it up buttercup. Stop obstructing
Thank you!  Dems have been inspirational standing up to the fascist regime of Trump.
grow up buttercup.  Not a stolen seat.  He never had the votes.  If you want to be a protestor then resign
thank you for opposing  @realDonaldTrump SCOTUS nominee. Continue to #resist!

Agreed. Never let them steal that seat.
Stolen seat? Rubbish. Joe Biden Argued for Delaying Supreme Court Picks in 1992
It was the Dems that made the rule that no president can get a scotus on his last year. Memory issues again
I wish you'd kept your integrity, Jeff. I used to like you but #DemExit.

ALL so proud of U here in ORYGUN...
Once more ORYGUN makes an ass out of itself & 
THIS time U R it
Shut up and do your job.
The ignorant responses to this below make my stomach turn.
Thank you for opposing Neil Gorsuch. He opposes women's choice, workers, & death w/ dignity.
Resist ANY candidate @realDonaldTrump nominates unless they have a proven track record of being a centrist. #resist
I could only wish you were as zealous about the plight of rural Oregonians..
I think the Russians stole the seat. Investigate, now!!!
Ha. I think a Russian stole your seat, Ivan.
Yeah, and I'm PISSED! Where's that investigation? Chuck the Schmuck?
"Stolen"? Obama had a chance to fill the seat but didn't, so that's just tough noogies, man. It doesn't "belong" to ANYbody.
Thank you Senator! I'm proud to have you represent Oregon in the Senate.
Just upset they couldn't steal "ideological and extreme" Scalia's seat.
1st check the constitution, 2nd, this https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/joe-biden-argued-for-delaying-supreme-court-picks-in-1992.html â€¦
cry all you want to the ppl who own you. Gorsuch will be confirmed.
thank you for your support. We need to stand up for our rights so we do not lose them. Garland first
Hiroshima will be like a firecracker pop if McConnell uses the Dirty Harry rule "paybacks are a bitch"
oh Jeff, you and the liberal idiots need to sit down and be quiet. America has spoken
#Fillabuster #Resistance

you most likely would have called Jesus Christ a far right extremist too!
No: Jesus would be a Democrat.He'd be the first to help the poor/refugees. Republicans should be ashamed of their selfishness #WWJD
explain far right extremist? Following the constitution as written?
Stolen because a Republican led Congress did EXACTLY the same thing a Democrat led Congress would do? RIGHT
Thanks Jeff!  We, your voters (and most of the country) support your filibuster!  Stick to it.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump #BlockGorsuch
LOL
Thank you, Senator Merkley.  Thank you for standing up for what's right in America
thx u !  I concur. #StolenSCOTUSeat
You're a public servant? Look into the suspicious/advantageous timing of Scalia's death Obama wanted seat for an extreme lib
Stop whining. The Dems do the same thing, nominate extreme liberals. Scalia's life was STOLEN. #criminal
Whoa, there. Not even nutjob conspiracy theorists consider Scalia's death suspicious. He died among right-wingers. Settle down.
thank you. filibuster the shit out of this thief!
yes following the Constitution is so extreme, you nut job
thank you for having a spine! We will have your back. Let dems know this is the hill to die on!
