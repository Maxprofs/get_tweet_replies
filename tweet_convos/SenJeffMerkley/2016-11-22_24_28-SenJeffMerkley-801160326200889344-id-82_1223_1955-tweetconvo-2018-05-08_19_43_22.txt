so your saying people shouldn't protest and there voices don't need to be heard??? Really!!!!
well not that i know specifically there, but protesting should always be fine, rioting is never okay
these people are protecting their own sacred burial grounds, the police are the violent ones!
@SenSanders @washingtonpost police must prte ct them selves and enforce the law. Trumps coming with his stand his ground ..
we do it all over the country.  Many citizens have had to. These people are no exception.
@SenSanders @washingtonpost I'm saying it's stolen property and yes there in there right
amen
@JanieceStaton @washingtonpost @LorettaLynch @POTUS Stop this insanity! It is cruel! You have the authority to stop it!
@SenSanders @washingtonpost @SenWarren Where is @SenWarren?? Where is @POTUS ???

@SenSanders @washingtonpost justice department should intervene, where us media? Obama? Anybody?
The Army Corps bypassed required environmental impact statement (EIS) & its public hearings. Need EIS now!
@SenSanders @washingtonpost 
Of course they defend their decision anything they do is right no matter what and no one cares.
Then they should remain "P E A C E F U L
@SenSanders @washingtonpost can't voice my opinion to the president. Cut off, transferred to closed line. Has he quit?
It is the people of this country who feel the icy chill of the water cannon. Perhaps the cold will awaken them
Absolutely incredible.  Armed military style police show up to oppose a group of unarmed peaceful protesters....
@skepticsmash @washingtonpost Im also against the water canon, but this silly tactic will help the protests.
@skepticsmash @washingtonpost Im against new oil and coal in the age of Elon Musk, but "fearing for their lives"? Really?
please. Say no to #DAPL!! #IStandWithStandingRock
I believe, Martin Luther King was right, that is: simply non-violent marches by telling criminals to stay home.

Please make @POTUS stop the violence. Please take action!
When "having their say" includes violence and destruction of property, it's no longer a protest and you shouldn't support it
SHAMEFUL We have always taken advantage of our Native Americans, the property is theirs, they have RIGHTS !
Thank you, but where is the President and the rest of the democrats?#NoDAPL
#WhatWouldJesusSioux?
water  #cannons should be banned! 
@SenSanders is that an Ulta Beauty filter?
Please add w/o violence from within: radicals must be weeded out to avoid retaliation by:  ALT-NOT RIGHT BULLIES
Ever heard of a tyranical police state not defending the use of any force? This is America.
@SenSanders @washingtonpost How do people lose their rights? Little by little.

The thin blue line stepped way beyond.
#PoliceState No better now than "evil" enemy countries you despise and fight!  #Merica #NoDAPL
Same shit. Different pile. Same stink.
@SenSanders @washingtonpost wish you had the nuts to run for president
the people soaking others down w/water cannons in subzero temp get to go home to warm homes w/hot running water.
The protesters are in the wrong trespassing and attacking innocent construction workers:
@SenSanders @washingtonpost then these protesters must stop desructing whn they protest thy like thugs Torching everyth
agreed
how can we protect these innocent people that are just protecting their water source?
@SenSanders @washingtonpost Why celebrate Thanksgiving? Shameful! Doing it again to the Natives
@SenSanders in solidarity with Standing Rock Sioux.  It should not be criminal to defend our right to protect clean water.
@SenSanders @washingtonpost Or without destroying property and throwing rocks at police
Thank you. Please help others on the Hill realize whats going on!
@thepowerofmeow What's with the Senate Democratics taking up the wolf killing in the Great Lakes Has Dems lost their faith
