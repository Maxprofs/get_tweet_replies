At this point, how are Trump supporters not wondering what the hell is in this thing and why haven't we seen it?
They simply do. not. care. As long as it "pisses off the libruls" they would sacrifice their first born at the altar of Trump.
Hmm... that might actually help #maga

Just sayin'
I felt the same way about the TPP. Our system is broken when any bill can be debated in secrecy.
Ask Russia to hack their files for you. I hear it is perfectly okay with the GOP if for them to steal American documents & posts them online
.@SenJeffMerkley @Taylor49er Dems need to come up with ideas for AHCA since GOP's only idea is to steal from the poor and disabled!
Thank you for your effort on behalf of all Americans - and especially those dealing with cancer and other serious conditions.  We need help!
F them!! Hold them treasonous traitors back! November 6, 2018 we will come out and take all of them out #SecurePolls get Security Guards 
@WillSeattle @SenateMajLdr McConnell forgot he works for the public. Guess he's ok w/ making sure public hates him, Senate.
Americans will hold you accountable @SenateMajLdr Your actions are unacceptable & despicable. Americans deserve much better than u in Senate
That's great but why are you suddenly a huge sellout on climate?  Have you been bought?
Counting on @SenateDems to #HoldTheFloor and keep GOP ghouls in the spotlight. They'd like nothing more than for this to be in the rearview.
KUDOS FROM THE SW!!!  Keep fighting the good fight for all of us. Your strident efforts don't go unnoticed &VERY APPRECIATED
And they'll take our Healthcare to fund evil Budget that will give huge tax breaks to only most Wealthy GOP lacks all morals & compassion #2
Get rid of filibuster for everything #goNuclear
He's pushing genocide. Do I smell an ad?
No. We are better off letting the Trumpanezes pass the bill and constantly remind the voter that they asked for it
"Well...um...we have to...um...uh...pass it...so then we can...um...uh...read it..to...um...see what in it."  Ah don't ya miss the classics?
Saboteurs .@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @GOP Congress secretly jamming #TrumpCare Tax Break 4 Rich thru Senate. Repealing ACA = MALFEASANCE.
Keep fighting.
Government by the people and for the people. What a joke.
@senrobportman If you vote 4 this, I will have written on my tombstone: "ROB PORTMAN MURDERED ME WITH DEATHCARE!"
We are counting on you, don't let this outrage go unchallenged. We have a right to know what is in this bill, the Right are wrong!
You guys ALL need to stop PLAING politics an effin DO politics!! You know the basic stuff you learned in college why your postion is there!
Please take Merkley to CA and keep him.
They promised their base a repeal and they will deliver no matter what. I'm so tired of their base! Hateful uninformed people.
Why r you letting a criminal like Mitch to keep screwing Americans? Why hasn't he been charged w rules violations, take big Rus $.
What can we, as Americans, do on top of emaiking/calling senators?  Just wait to see what happens?
Thanks so much for fighting.
Thank you Senator Merkley for speaking up for us. @SenateMajLdr what is wrong with you? Show the bill!
Keep up the good fight 
Keep grandstanding and pandering    It's what u do best
Given enough rope maybe.      2018 is just around the corner!
Lol this is awesome

Sen. Merkley, thank you for asking for us.
Thank you. I feel like my voice is choked here in Texas and I'm glad that my neighbors fight for my rights in their stead
We can do something about it. Call/fax your senators! It'll make a difference. The Senate Switchboard ph# & more is on this list. #callswork
We won't stand for this. And he will be thrown out with the rest of the trash.
You had your chance and blew it. Created a healthcare system that didn't work. Last thing GOP needs is wacko lib idea's on healthcare.
Keep fighting, Senator. We need you and other "Protectors of Democracy"! Meanwhile, we will persist and #resist
Keep fighting
Thanks
Thank you Senator Merkley. We need to see the bill. My mother and brother depend on their health coverage and can't afford huge increases .
@JudahWorldChamp @SenateMajLdr Sounds rather cowardly, to me.
We need Frank Underwood to intervene here
Exactly!
The hypocrisy, secrets and lying are shameful and vile.  Shame on you @GOP @SenateMajLdr
Thanks for being on the floor tonight. Thanks for exposing this debacle and shameless strategy.
Thank you Senator Merkley.  Stay strong.
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley Bc @SenateMajLdr McConnell canNOT be Trusted! Mitch is just as #corrupt as drumpf - sheer Evil.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for trying to stop this un-American bill. @SenateMajLdr will go down as a traitor.
Keep up this fight Senator! The American people are behind you! This bill is an affront to all that is decent, good and kind. #HoldTheFloor
Keep FIGHTING the BASTARDS
SecretHealthCareBillRevealed: "All Work And No Play Makes Jack A Dull Boy".
Jeff, why don't the democrats prepare a proposal to repair the AHCA and sell it to the public?  Grandstanding doesn't help the sick.
Thank you Senator Merkley! Everyone deserves to know what is being crafted in this bill.
Withhold consent. Start amassing amendments for the vote-a-rama. Please.
I've never been a fan of it, but you must obstruct all you can. No regular business until hearing are held!
Keep fighting, Senator!  You're the best! 
Thank you for continuing to fight.  Please don't give up.  So many people are counting on you!
To bad you failed in you responsibilities to Oregon to helpful in this process.  #passthebill
Kinda like the dems passed theirs without reading it.  Problems everywhere 
They represent the public. Can they do this. Is their a legal platform to sue to demand transparency?
I thought our government was based on openness & transparency. McConnell wants to dictate his preferences to the majority using secrecy
Senator, why is this not Malfeasance being committed by McConnell?
If we dont get to see it or hold hearings or add amendments, it's an automatic NO vote #HoldTheFloor
Keep it up! We're pulling for you!
If the bill is secret, how do you know it's bad? 
Thank you Jeff. I'm happy you are representing me.
lets not forget in2018 make it the death nil for the GOP more nails in the coffin
America needs to Lead Way to PEACE & Be Proud to Do It. It's the Only GOOD Choice anyone has. Not much else matters anymore. #StopWars, NOW.
But you have to pass it to read it.
I can't understand why they are holding our lives and health hostage. This affects all of America and they refuse to let us know. WHY #GOP??
Nothing to do with concern 4 health care. All about putting the funding in their benefactor's pockets. They care NOTHING  for us as people.
How are they getting away with everything they're doing???? #HoldTheFloor
Great work! You make Oregon proud! Stay strong, again
Are you insane senator? Unprecedented was DNC telling GOP they can read Obama care AFTER IT'S PASSED. #PRECEDENTPERSPECTIVE
They are greedy cowards.
Why? What are they afraid of????
Keep asking. Make him publicly reject it a kabillion times. Get all of them on the historical record.
Yes!!!
how do they get to do that? What shifty piece of fluff they trying to saddle us with? #HoldTheFloor #ShowUsTheBill
Mitch McConnell works for us, the American people. It is unacceptable to leave us out of the loop.
They have forgotten long ago that they work for us. They behave like entitled, greedy jerks.
Keep at it. You have to figure out a way forward. The GOP secrecy is unacceptable!
I think GOP's playing tiddlywinks.
hmmmm  is this how democracy is supposed to work?
Then, @SenJeffMerkley, @SenSchumer & @SenateDems should share their double-secret plan to save & fix Obamacare! @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP
How are they aloud to hide a bill that will affect all of us, are u kidding me!!
Please HOLD THE FLOOR!
Dude, it's a right wing corporate coup facilitated by a bunch of shills. #resist won't cut it. We're past that point.
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley! Keep fighting!
No one and I mean NO ONE should have as much power as MM has. Not only has it gone to his head he is 100% abusing it. What a disgusting POS.
Republicons creating the unity a deeply divided nation needs. Even their own base will get screwed. Anti-American & shameless.
on what grounds? did he give any reason at all?
NOTHING SHOULD EVER BE ALLOWED TO BE MADE LAW WITHOUT PROPER PUBLIC DISCUSSION! THIS IS LITERALLY AN AFFRONT TO DEMOCRACY!
TY!! Keep fighting for us Senator!
Please keep up the fight.  We need to get the American people to understand what the GOP is attempting to do to us.
.@SenateMajLdr is such a coward.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for fighting for the American people - against the corrupt @GOP who wants to sell us out to the highest bidder.
So, the majority leader, McConnell said no?!! This is a bad sign. During Obama, the ACA was discussed/debated for a year!
Keep Fighting!  Don't let this bullshit pass!  #HoldTheFloor
Thank you, Jeff! Glad I voted for you to represent my family. #ShowUsTheBill
There has to be at least 2 Rep Senators with enough integrity to vote NO....and there better be ZERO Dem's who vote for it @SenSchumer
TRUMPCARE (AHCA) affects MILLIONS of Americans. What is the @GOP hiding? Dont let them sell out Americans to Ins. Companies. #ShowUsTheBill
Thank you Senator.  Keep fighting for us.  It's life or death for so many.
Push Singlepayer! This is how in part you will win back working class and beat the Republicans.
Keep up the fight!  Many of us Oregonians are with you!!!
Unconscionable leadership. Please keep fighting.
I saw. My take? Trumpâ€™s Budget and Healthcare Plan: Economic Terrorism on the Elderly, Poor, and Children
Aggresive primate dealing with issues!
Like an orange orangutan
What is going on? This is insanity.
