Thank you Sen. Merkley for standing up for the people. No vote for Judge Gorsuch.
Bigger blabber mouth than Granny Schumer.
Great job @SenJeffMerkley #StopGorsuch he only cares about protecting corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens. @DNC rally troops!
That's our guy! #oregon #senatormerkley
#holdthefloor  Much respect sir!
/  And it's all for nothing because the NUCLEAR OPTION WILL BE USED!
Go nuclear!!!!
With you in spirit!!
And bam we won anyway! You should've took your old ass home last night!
If the GOP has their way everybody would be working 12 hours with no benefits. #GOPHATESAMERICA
@SenJeffMerkley Thank you 
@ChelseaClinton nut job libtard! Hope he lost his voice!
awwwee
Thank you Senator Merkley and Senator Schumer.
Gorsuchs isn't a good pick at all, he has a hard time judging realistically! #No
Thank you, Sen Merkley. You're indeed the leader of the people's party. History will record your invaluable role w/ an indelible marker pen.
Democrats did it first!!!!
Not a filibuster a talkathon. Dems get out of ur own way and start working. Do ur job. And NO that's not doing ur job. Be proactive and stop
Yo, @SenateDems, come on the floor and give Sen Merkley a break - he's done 12 hours...and has our profound gratitude.
If this is a peaceful protest, can  six million of us show up to offer our words of protest to a GOP hell bent on continuing to lie to us?
Ha, I'd teleport there in a heartbeat.
Yeah like democrats don't lie! good god people are dumb! No wonder we are 20 trillion in debt, and have all of these other problems!
Thank you Senator #jeffmerkley!!
It's Wed AM and he's still going. I just learned a lot about the history of past nomination/outcomes. @SenateDems I want to see you there!
Wasn't that amazing!! I love how he used this time!
He was so well spoken, so prepared. I'm going to call his office today to thank him. He went for 15 hours I believe.
Great idea! I called too!. I also called Senator Durbin's office to thank him for his support this am.
Thank you Senator Merkley!
A true man of strength who stands FOR the people of America. Go Jeff!
What a nut! He'll likely collapse! Over nothing!
Another idiot like Schumer both worthless!
Merkley huffs and puffs while chemical weapons are killing children in Syria. Dems have wrong priorities.
Gorsuch is qualified so stop talking & wasting time and confirm him. You have no legitimate reason to vote no. Do your job! #confirmgorsuch
So brave to stand up and speak for so long. What are you accomplishing other than wasting time? Oh, it's just a show. Got it. Do your job!
THE GOP HAS NO RIGHT TO SHOVE THROUGH SOMEONE TO SUCH A IMPORTANT POSITION
Probably the hardest Jeff Merkley has worked in the past 10 years
The dems are a joke. Foreign countries are watching them and are horrified & saddened that they show such a lack of respect for the  POTUS.
@SenJeffMerkley We are proud of you Sen Merkley
No Dems opposed Gorsuch before. Why the opposition now? Gorsuch hasn't changed. #PettyPolitics Since last election, voters are laser focused
#ConfirmGorsuch
@SenJeffMerkley they do make melatonin if you can't sleep...
Oregon is proud of you, Senator Merkley!
Vote this obstructionist out!
Bravo  @SenJeffMerkley #StopGorsuch
You guys are HYPOCRITES!
Chuck is that you in the picture?
bring on the nuke. Time to make dems eat it
Proud to have him as my senator!
Dems poor looser
Hes a hypocrite. He was one of the senators who supported in killing the fillabuster last year.   SHUT UP AND  and Get Off
Good luck... you know what's coming so have fun with your obstructionism while you can.
He loses to Gorsuch and the 20 hours you kept him talking!
Get over your Trump Derangement Syndrome and confirm the highly qualified Neil Gorsuch!
Keep protesting! STOP GORSUCH
#turnthescrews
If you think that representation of constituents, participation in democracy & speaking truth don't matter, you have submitted to tyranny.
Thank you Senator Jeff Merkley!! #holdthefloor #StopGorsuch
Go Jeff Go! What you're doing matters! Every hr. we delay Gorsuch shortens the 2 GENERATIONS he'll be a judge! #resist
@SenSchumer Nice waste of time!! Sen. Schumer! Time for your to retire, old man!! You've been a Career politician for too long!
You have my respect.  Thanks
THANK YOU
#holdthefloor #RESISTANCE
And the American people thank him!!! @senatedems
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley !!
Another Democrat obstructionist speaking lies against a good man
⚘⚘
The GOP can shut him down if they chose too
The world is falling apart all around you and all you care to do is burn time & money
.you should be ashamed
@SenJeffMerkley yep, so full of hot air can babble to eternity
@ChelseaClinton My new hero @SenJeffMerkley 
@cspan @WSJ @maggieNYT @GlennKesslerWP 
**Breaking**
Gorsuch also a plagiarist!

#FilibusterGorsuch
Thank you sir! You're a warrior for democracy.
did anyone watch, did anyone care what you obstructionist had to say. Said it before if Gorsuch was Obama pick you would be voting yes
@SenSchumer he's no Ted Cruz and neither are you Chuckie where is the Russian story haven't heard much about that last couple days
What a waste of tax payer money.
Once an ass always an ass n Cuck fits right in!!!!!!Hahahahaha,Hahahahaha,Hahahahaha
Go Jeff...Will never be forgotten.
U should B calling for Susan Rice to B investigated.  Leaked names of private citizens 4 political reasons.  Broke the law, used gov tools
Americans R sick of these empty protests against a fine, fair candidate like Gorsuch.  Stop wasting Gov time & resources for revenge, petty

Senator, you ought to raise a parliamentary objection if McConnell tries to change the Senate rules by a simple majority.
Still trying to make a name for himself in the shadow of his stepdad, Wyden.  Laughable.
@ChelseaClinton last congress used nuclear option- time for the libs to get a taste of their own medicine
THANK YOU.
You're a rock star, man - thank you!!!!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley #StopGorsuch

Great work.  As a taxpayer, voter, and U S  CITIZEN. #DONT_STOP
Thank you, Senator. Amazing job and outstanding effort.
WHAT? They use memes in Congress?
Wow. This man is a hero.
This is like watching a bunch of Kindergartners.  How about growing up #SenDems
Nothing you do will stop the Gorsuch confirmation. You're wasting time, obstructing procedure, acting childish  & making a fool of yourself
STUPID
@SenJeffMerkley thank you Senator! 
@SenSchumer 
Champion!
Stupid people doing stupid things that make no damn difference DA Dems in action
Thank you, Sen Merkley.
Rushing my a$$. You have been holding up every selection of Trump since day 1. Your LIES are getting old & full of desperation.
Gorsuch can wait. Senate still have to confirm Garland, or, like Cruz/McConnell/Heritage said: the SCOTUS can remain at 8.
What does Garland have to do with anything? Senate didn't bring him up for vote. Right or Wrong, Garland was rejected.
You've brilliantly and ironically answered. You didn't disappoint.
They are risking their entire existence over this and Susan Rice and hopefully defeating DT. Very sad. And possibly fatal. #toddlers
99% of his rulings have been unanimous, 97% he's been in the majority on 10th Circuit. But this isn't political BS... right?
Hold that floor!!!!
lol
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley. I hope other @SenateDems come to relieve you!
Go Jeff!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley I'd buy you a cup of coffee if I could! THANK YOU!!!
You realize this isn't going to change the fact that Gorsuch will be our next Supreme Court justice, right? #absurdity #lostcause
Do Whatever It Takes 2 Stop This STOLEN NOMINATION. GOP Thought  "We The People" Should Just Sit Back & Take Their CRAP? No, Dont!
J Merkley use you time and energy for something constructive.  Do something to help the people you represent.  # partisan
He was helping women & the working man. Cc: @SenJeffMerkley
who gets to read Dr Seuss? ;-)
You are legend!  Way to go Senator Merkley!
he's a disgrace
You people are completely useless.
@SenSchumer disgraceful
This. Democracy at it's best!  TY @SenJeffMerkley for reminding us why we #resist
Thank you, Jeff Merkley!  At some point someone can relieve him by requesting the floor or something, right?
Thank you Jeff,stay strong! He's a plagiarist, no integrity SC Justice? Feh!
#WalkInTruth #ThankYouJeffMerkley #Eyes2See #Stretch #Breathe
Not all heroes wear capes.

@SenSchumer you demo are going to be no count by Friday
Really? You would wish death of aSenator?
WTG Sen. Merkley!!. Keep up the good fight!
Thank you for your effort
Borking of Gorsuch and High tech lynching of Clarence Thomas classic democrats
GOD BLESS JEFF MERKLEY. OUTSTANDING!
I worry about nuclear option, but pray dems stay in the minority for many decades to come.
pure evil
Thank you for your efforts
I support him thank u fot dtanding up for fotgotten people
Admirable!!! Thank you!!

@SenJeffMerkley Incredible!!!Your efforts are so appreciated! It's like you're competing in the Iron Man Triathlon of filibusters.
This is a major dem mistake.  Here's why - when Ginsburg is out which is soon, the 60 vote rule would have led to a more moderate justice...
New Englanders are the most patriotic Americans!
Thank u Mr Merkley, while I slept in my nice bed u stayed up all nite for Americans rights and the future of this nation. American Hero
You are the Man.
Keep strong @SenJeffMerkley
