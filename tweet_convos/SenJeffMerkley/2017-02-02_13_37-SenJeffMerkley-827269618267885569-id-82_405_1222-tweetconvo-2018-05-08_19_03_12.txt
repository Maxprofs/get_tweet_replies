wrong. She is not a major threat. She is buying her way in. She is not experienced.  Look at the mess in Michigan education
Which senate colleague can be turned our way?
@SenToomey or just keep calling any Repub. They all need turned.
or try this, Dc teachers will connect you https://m.facebook.com/events/243619972751193/ …
Thank you, Senator Merkley.
Thank you! It's great to see some Senators have integrity and can't be bought like some! #DeVos #CORRUPTION #DeVosHearing
#devos will be a major savior to our education system
You need to resign Jeff. Your shitting all over the American way of life. Thanks to the DNC you do not have our backs.
Parents and students want school choice.
It's also hard to take your opposition to DeVos seriously after your Gorsuch stunt. Pick your battles, Senator.
.@SenJeffMerkley Thank you for taking a strong stand against #DeVos! We need committed, science-embracing leaders for Dept of Ed.
I'm undecided over who is the worst representative of Oregon. You or Sen. Wyden It's a jump ball
Please stop using pictures of disabled That & you are disgusting We like DeVos Finally someone who represents all
U & rest of dems are afraid of $$ lost (pay-backs) from corrupt teachers unions.
thank you for supporting the rights of all children. I appreciate your work.
devos is a hero for the low and middle class by giving us the school choice that only the rich have, Jeff hero of the rich
devos is a champion of the poor and middle class by giving them the school choice that only the wealthy have enjoyed.
be honest jeff
thank you!!!!! #DumpDevos #realpa. It's not too late @SenToomey the coward!
Thank you for supporting our educational monopoly. Only the rich deserve school options. #GovKnowBest #DeVos
Let's be honest, you stand only with the unions that finance you coffers.
Thank you for this, Senator. My brother is special needs and:
..@SenJeffMerkley Grand Standing Jeff??
Wrong again. Competition ALWAYS improves quality and reduces cost. Government/Union control kills competition! You've lost!
Thank you for standing strong. We've been watching almost every hearing and you've been in the front lines.

agreed! #devosnotqualified why do #GOP senators refuse to admit this? Signed -discouraged lifetime educator
Thx for voting NO on DeVos. I was in special ed, I'm a mom, & grad student in special ed.  DeVos is danger for FAPE for all
DeVos is the answer to a broken and brainwashed education system. You are acting like bratty spoiled children. #TRUMP4PDX
love this Senator
you are a douche bag for using a child like this for your political agenda.
Thank you for standing up for students!
fight fight fight! Never stop! Standing with your fight and filibuster and obstruction
concentrate on getting ONE more decent Republican Senator to vote no. Make them own & pay for each & every vote.
thank u for standing strong
can you ask Grassley, Toomey, and Scott to recuse themselves looks like they may have a conflict of interest
Thanks you!
THANK YOU!! And please let's remove the R-word from politics. Libta-d, etc. upsets my students.
Keep up the fight! And don't listen to the haters - they'll never vote for you anyway.
thank you!
Jeff Merkley you are threat to the US and Oregon. You have no facts or truth to back up your lies
Oregon is proud! Thank you!!
thank you! i stand with you!
please do everything possible to block her nomination. Let us know what Rep. may vote against. We need to contact them asap
has the guts to honor principles and resist. Too many other Democrats @NancyPelosi are limp wrists.
Thank you, Senator! Anyone who supports liquidating public education needs to study Michigan, Florida. Awful outcomes.
THANK YOU for all that you do! #resist
Thank you, Senator, for standing up for those of us in Oregon and across the country!
THANK YOU!  Not sure how ANYONE can support a nom that struggled so much to answer simple questions at her hearing!
Yep. Our graduation rate may drop from 48th to 49th in the nation.
thank you for voting NO!
thank you Senator. I'm the parent of an autistic adult who would have no life if not for the IDEA.
Thank you Senator for working hard for our children.

Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley  #MerkleySupportsThePeopleOfOregon
Thank you, Senator.

I am so ashamed to have you representing me in our government!
The Salli you should have tried harder to get someone else elected.
I sure did.
Thank you for taking a stand on this. Proud to be represented by you! 
Thank you Senator.  Keep up the fight!
Thank you for your NO Vote.
