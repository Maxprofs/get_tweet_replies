CLIP: @SenJeffMerkley asks #OMBNom MickMulvaney about 2009 & 2017 #Inauguration crowd size. 
@cspan TV had millions more viewed , millions more Steamed! Can't take that away from are very popular President!
where is proof of your statement??
He you go http://bit.ly/2jnoiFg   @RendaBeltzer @SenJeffMerkley @cspan
the Daily Caller is not considered a reputable neutral news source sorry.
Check with FB then since there is a quote from a rep of FB @RendaBeltzer @SenJeffMerkley @cspan @DailyCaller
What part of not a reliable news source makes me need to double check? I think ur leader called these stories "fake news."
So you're saying Andy Stone from Facebook was lying?
no
you are a liar. you use a false comparison of the inauguration. the picture you use is in the early morning before it starts
No, Loren. Trump had far fewer people @ his inauguration than Obama. It's called a FACT, snowflake.
I know that but the picture CNN used does not show how the crowd filled in those blank areas later in the day
There was no crowd, unless you're referring to the Women's March, which crushed Trump's Inauguration. SAD!
Who is President? That's what I    thought.
@cspan although Mulvaney played dumb, I applaud the Senator's attempts for a straight answer.
@SenSchumer @cspan thank you so much for standing up for us!  Lies are lies not alternative facts.
@cspan THANK U for a tough line of questions to OBM nom & defending FACTS. This was brilliant! ORD2 Appreciates YOU!
@SenSchumer @cspan Dumbest line of questioning ever on Senate floor. Gillebrand now number 2.
Kamala Harris still holds the title..  for her Pompeo questions.  Merkley is now #2.  Poor Dems
Do the job you're paid to do. Not mine is bigger than your BS. Dear God, these are petty, childish, men.
@cspan YOur wasting our money! When you guys ask REAL questions that matter maybe you will make a difference
Maybe we just need new Senators who see a bright future in this country instead of doom and gloom.
Why are you using CNN's lies when the real truth lies within this picture?
@cspan You should step down if your sensor for fake news is so obviously broken! http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/01/crowd-size-matters-trump-is-right-it-was-huge/ …
I think this was the best question. I would like to see it repeated for all confirmation hearings. See who'll say the truth
how much of OUR money did you spend on those posters? A few hundred $ may not seem like much 2u, but this was not well spent
what is happening to Washington? Can any of you stop this?
We need Senators with brains, not career hacks ruining perception that public service as a politician is a noble enterprise!
apparently your staff let you down, ck out the interactive @CNN pic BTW truth matters! http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/ …
Partisan propagandists. Anyone with a brain knows she meant 'different perspective'. Pedantic and despicable Democrats.
as one of your constituents, thank you! 
@cspan Weasel words and obfuscation are hallmarks of Trump appointees. Thanks for standing up for us. #resist
Refreshing to see senators behaving like serious-minded grown-ups. 
#alternativefacts
@cspan Wow impressive
yes I agree use facts! apples to apples. your picture is false! cnn has nice updated picture as well! not nearly the diff.
block Betsy DeVos
You need to have a chat with Art Laffer.
@cspan you're the best Senator Merkley!!! Myrtle Creek represent!
@cspan @POTUS We need senators who care more about potential unfunded liabilities & unsustainable debt than crowd numbers.
Mulvaney embraces trickle-down economics. We know how well that worked last time
We need a Senator who knows taxing corporations is a stealth tax of employees,pension plans,and consumers.Flat tax all else.
@cspan nicely done, thank you for this!!
@SenSchumer @cspan That's been a joke since Reagan wealthy put extra money in their own pockets
@jconrad912 @cspan they tried it in 1980's and nothin came out of it for the poor and the middle class
we tried it under Bush as well. It does not increase revenue & never has
this is the very definition of insanity,doing the same thing and expecting a different result
@cspan Well done! Thank you. Your example was creative and brilliant! We absolutely need more senators like you.
@cspan Thank you
@cspan brilliant show-and-tell, sir!
We love you @SenJeffMerkley you are great for our beautiful state of Oregon. Kudos 2 you
You made my day with this question about crowd size. TY for the comic relief.
You should be embarrassed by this clip. #sad
stay on it, sir.
those with tech skill watched live stream..including this 63 yr native Oregonian  2 broke from Dem policies to make the trip
how childish...this Native Oregonian not impressed by your stunt.
what a childish performance today. Very unprofessional.
@cspan
how much tax money was spent on this waste of posterboard?
THANK YOU! @SenJeffMerkley
@cspan that display was perhaps the example of ineptitude that fills our halls of congress
@cspan http://cnn.it/2jzE12o  think of this as a big, huge hockey stick graph!
@cspan obstruction is not becoming and doesn't do you any favors with voters. Division baiter
@cspan vomiting
seriously senator, and u complain about Trump acting Presidential, look in mirror.
@cspan Are you kidding me what a waist of time you are thanks for proven the point that a lot of you are waisting are money
@cspan NICE JOB!! 
@cspan I'm a Georgia resident, but  watched the testimony today! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
It's almost as though you drew a red line in the sand.
You wasted taxpayer money today with your bullshit! #swamprat
you want to know a Fact?  If you cut spending you can lower your deficit!!!
hey, let's compare the crowd of Hillary's inauguration to Trump's. Bahahahaha
$9.4T  added to the debt during Obama's 96 months, $98B a MONTH, and now you're suddenly worried about deficits and debt?
You are a disgrace lol. Democrat party is imploding and I LOVE it
@cspan let's see a picture of you and the former loser president...which one is a bigger loser?
Do you see how ridiculous you look?! Sadly it doesn't seem like you get it!! Quit wasting tax payer money! @POTUS @SenTomCotton @rep
YOU NEED TO GROW UP! You people still haven't figured out why @HillaryClinton lost! There's a bunch of babies working in congress!
@cspan You proved the point for the left's #UnableToGetOverIt & taking the high road with your crowd size Q&A. #MAGA
Stupid questions. Not surprising.
How dishonest,biased & misuse of committee time & taxpayers resources to display proven irrel pic.Try this 1 -real time
~Seriously? Ur approach was such an embarrassment?! How can u complain about the other side when ur dealings r so immature!!
You are an embarrassment.
.@SenJeffMerkley #ThisIsHowYouGotTrump ...
AMERICA needs Sen's who bring RELEVANT facts & put America's REAL interests ahead of troll-like grandstanding in DC! #MAGA
@cspan And how much taxpayer dollars did you waste on this?! Stop wasting our money!!
@cspan Congratulations on the worst analogy of the year. #Lame
@cspan did you use taxpayer money for that picture? Hope not.  Question wasn't relevant to that nominee.
Use this picture next time.  Most obvious: https://twitter.com/MikeyManker/status/823289984815865856 …
@cspan Trump is going to have the last laugh!
you seriously need help...mental help.
smdh
Wow! You set a new standard for stupid!
Clown questioning. Accomplished nothing.
@cspan this was beautiful
@cspan you can't be serious?  What an embarrassment to your job, those you represent and your family.
@cspan you stay strong! Thank you!
@SenSchumer @cspan  He's not qualified if in finances he was unable to know the result of Regan and Bush tax programs
you are an American hero.
@cspan Thank you
Thank you Senator. We need your leadership now more than ever. Resist this America
-- What you did was so wrong! And THIS picture was taken while Trump was walking out: http://www.hopenjesus.com/images/21inaugurationphotos11-master675.jpg … -Deal with it!
-- Seriously, you should be ashamed of yourself!
great way to make your point, Sir! Thank you! 
http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/ …
Wealthy you dang DEMs always try to use that and grandma will starve, children will go hungary on and on what a bunch of YUK
This was amazing! Great job. I don't get how people can still pretend trickle down works. Kansas is also a great example!
@cspan You just got yourself a new follower.
@SenSchumer. 2/ This is exact opposite of what u asked him.  R's can't hide their true ideology: taking care of the elite.
@cspan @timkaine YOU ARE THE BOMB!!! Please never stop!! WE NEED YOU!! And Tim your expression-priceless!!! #VaDem
@SenSchumer. Mulvaney: "If ur asking abt my sense of justice of robbing from rich & giving 2 poor". Shows his true colors.1/
@cspan And the point of the pic taken at the same time of day is another farce indicating why you are irrelevant.
You are my new hero for this questioning.
Keep up the pressure! Your constituents support you! Proud you are my senator!
@cspan ALL the applause 
@SenSchumer  is he stupid? Let's get on with the real issues
@cspan Thank you
That was beautiful.
@SenSchumer @cspan WTG SenM notice how he wouldn't commit to the crowd being smaller? Slimy swamp swimmer
@cspan just saw you on CNN Embarrassing and petty and pretty much describes why politicians are held in such low esteem
How much tax payer money was used on making those giant posters? What a ridiculous waste of time and money.
@cspan great job today  
Senator, thank you!
@SenSchumer @cspan And if he doesn't know answer to any of your questions, what is he doing there?
@SenSchumer STOP
when we use phrase "alternative facts" instead saying the word lies, we legitimize their concept. Framing rule 1
@cspan I think his comment at the end about "..robbing from the rich and giving to the poor" pretty much told me everything.
thank you!!!!
yes, see this? http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/ …
@cspan Fantastic
Yes, it is http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/ …
Thank you for this! Facts are essential.
yes, they are http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/ …
@cspan democrats should be voting no for all of these people! Vote your conscience
they will vote no, but it doesn't matter. what does matter? ELECTIONS! and we won. quixotic effort #maga
@cspan 

BRAVO Senator BRAVO!!!
@cspan  Exactly. Facts are facts. Govt numbers gold standard, now being hidden, conflicted, falsified. Scary for citizens.
@cspan Awesome questions! We have 30 years of data. Trickle down doesn't grow the economy, it doesn't help the middle class.
Thank you for this, Senator. Thank you and keep on getting at the truth. This New Jersey family is behind you.
I am so glad you are my senator (and that you are a master troll)
You are an American hero! Thank you!
