@SenSchumer the education system has been failing for YEARS! Perhaps we should try something new.
@SenSchumer Tell the #TRUTH all Dem's care about is if she supports the hideous teachers unions, she supports our children
like education is doing a great job for our kids?it needs torn apart,back to basics,stop indoctrination of youts
Yes, because inner city public school are thriving after 8 years of Dems and most run by local Dems
have any of you been to any public schools lately? WE can do better for our children!
expell devos
@SenSchumer @SenGOP @HouseGOP How can the average American help to sway those who will vote 4 Mrs DeVos.
@SenSchumer don't look now but the public education system is not that great!
@SenSchumer http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/260471-schumer-refugee-pause-may-be-necessary#.WI-Plx5bF60.twitter …
this is a pathetic partisan attempt to obstruct the new administration. You have been marginalized and only seek relevance.
we care about our children and their education. She's the wrong choice. Billionaires do not understand
we care about choice and control of our children's education. Not partisan obstructionist grandstanding.
Merkley your a dweeb,  our children need a Higher Education, not garbage from the 70's
schools r failing to educate so sit down & be quiet.
@SenSchumer r u 4 real? R u absolutely for real?U think people are going to believe ur tweet it is so biased it's laughable
Looks Like your Report card!
@JB_Tw645 @SenJeffMerkley @SenSchumer Hey Sen Merkley: how much did @georgesoros pay you to make this statement?
I have not met anyone who supports PUBLIC schools who DUMMY down our children. WE want school choice. STOP IT!
LBGT is a fallacy. It is a perversion. Public schools teach our children that evil is good and good is evil.
CUE THE WAR ON WOMEN.  SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR THOSE WHO TREAT WOMEN THIS WAY..MADELEINE ALBRIGHT
She is not a good choice. If she gets nominated, we can kiss public education goodbye. Fixed: yes; destroyed? no
@SenSchumer obstructionist!
Talk to your fellow senators and tell them to stand up and FIGHT. Do not cave in to republican idiots @lindasue0818
@lindasue0818 I pray voters will remember all Senators that vote to confirm her, if so they will be out of a job.
the liberal agenda is tearing public education apart. Why should public schools have our support when they are FAILING?
school safety? They're gun free zones yet mass shootings are becoming a regular thing. Your ways don't work.
LGBT support should be left up to the families not decided and enforced by public schools. You are trampling on my rights.
and encouraging children to question their sexuality, messing with their heads. Stay out of kids underpants
kids and sexuality shouldn't be in the same sentence. Especially before puberty.
I believe that's pretty much what I said. I was agreeing with you Elle
can't agree more. Thanks for supporting public education!
God does not make mistakes, He cannot put a person in the wrong body. See what lies you want to teach our kids.
@SenSchumer she made it out of commitee you can't stop her
You aren't a teacher thank goodness
Thank You! 
THANK YOU SENATOR 
@SenSchumer Obama's Public education policies spent the most per student in the world just to drop further in math & science
She is a bad choice. Please vote NO. Thank you.
@SenSchumer I went to public school and graduated college 
Ms Devoss seems clueless about public schooling.
the adults are back in charge & we're fixing the public school system. Ppl like you are what's wrong w the #PublicFoolSystem
If your report card is representative, no wonder the public fool system is failing! How about protecting students from LGBT?
On behalf of all retired public school teachers with 30+ years service, thank you for voting NO on DeVos.
STANDING UP FOR SECURITY; JOBS AND AMERICAN CITIZENS: A+
He's the * @potus @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost @nytimes @HuffPostBlog #ImpeachTrump
@senschumer both in teachers union pocket. tenure equals keeping the worst and not best but the union pays you to keep it!
@SenSchumer how many Trump voters now don't want Devoss? You got what you wanted. She is just as unqualified as Trump is.
@SenSchumer Aren't there reasonable GOP Senators who actually will put country and children first?  Loyal to Trump?  UGH
fake leftist news why not help inner cities
Can't do any worse than it is now!
@SenSchumer Public education needs to be relegated to the ash heap of history. Public schools fuck kids up and brainwash.
But public schools are not doing the best job, especially in Dem minority communities
@SenSchumer If you were a teacher our kids would be even dumber than they are now.  God forbid.
@SenSchumer @SenJeffMerkley well you ate not you ate m Ire worried with protecting teachers union that keep bad teachers employed
@SenSchumer Block DeVos
@SenSchumer and ur indoctrination of children with Sharia Law is an improvement?
@SenSchumer if I were grading Dems on immigration u would be expelled https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205367646526375&set=gm.883937008391343&type=3 …
VOTE NO ON SESSIONS & DEVOS. A NO-BRAINER DEMS..

If I was grading Dem perf during cabinet confirm process I'd giveUan "F"an"A" for divisiveness @SenJeffMerkley @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump
@SenSchumer Just say NO! Have all Dem's say NO! Recruit some GOP's to say NO!
@SenSchumer @SenJeffMerkley You je
@SenSchumer I'm soooo glad you aren't a teacher... wish you weren't a senator either!
@SenSchumer We need Education Choice. Co firm Betsy DeVos!!!!
trump had her do the same test, had the same result and thought, "great, she'll do"
That is only IF you were the teacher. It is YOUR opinion.. and you know what they say about OPINIONS!!!
@SenSchumer Why does the present system spend double the dollars per student and rank at the bottom in the world? FAILURE
@SenSchumer Give her a chance, you don't know what she can or can't do or what she will do.
ahhh, that's cute. how about Sessions, Price, Tillerson, $ Mnuchin? We're expecting unified @SenateDems no votes
for all you Trump people hope you have $$ for that private education. You will need it.
Vote NO!
@SenSchumer What a loser.
They forgot to mention the conflict of interest in her owning a #BoxedWater company as well.
@SenSchumer yet Sen. Alexander is singing her praises like a songbird. Obviously party b4 children and education. I'm scared
This report card is for Public Schools and Common Core!  Jeez - can't get this right either!  See what Dem education does?
Rich w/o a clue
Thank you for your statement about the #DeVos nomination.
Thank you Sen. Merkley! We need someone much better than this person in that post. Perhaps someone who has some knowledge!
Thank you! @RonWyden @HELPCmteDems @PattyMurray @oregoneducation @rweingarten @NEA
no Betsy DeVos!  She will destroy public education.
I have your back!
@SenJohnMcCain 
@sengraham2016 @SenToomey @SenCarlLevin @SenCortezMasto 
Vote NO on Rex Tillerson.
@SenWillyMoore @SenCoryGardner
@SenatorBooker
@RonWyden @SenSchumer
@SenFeinstein
"adheres to their enemies"




Thank you!
"SOMEBODY" needs to tear apart public education. It's total disaster!
Number of students successfully graduating from Oregon schools.........."F"  48th out of the 50 states.
Need to add Disability Rights! We cannot let them be forgotten.
and how would you grade Oregon teachers right now?
But your not a teacher. Your a partisan hack.
@KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein Thank you, Sir!
You placed LGBT rights in your list of requirements. Is that why our children can now choose which sex they are?
Of course, you're not a teacher, so this is purely conjecture. What would you do if you were a tree or a bicycle?
Which in this administration would not have a replicative report card!
Public schools are a farce teaching 'the test'. Kids are too dumbed down today they can not pass a 1900's 5th grade test.
Do you have any other information or explanation as to why you have presented this grade yet? I would like to read if so.
that F is it for Fascist?
Please vote No on this and all of the unqualified nominations. We trust and count on you!
but you enjoy watching refugee children suffer and die?
Thank you senator!
The American people have given the Teachers Union and administration an "F"  That is why we need major changes.
yes. Please do what you can to stop the destruction of public education
She did pass one subject with flying colors - "Money donated to GOP." Most obvious example of Pay to Play I have ever seen!
please vote no! Convince some of the more sane republicans as well!
thanks for all you do.  #resist
