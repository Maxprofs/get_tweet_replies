talk all u want, we'll vote after ur side drops. "Do u hear that Mr Merkley, that's the sound of inevitability"
For what? Did he give you a Philly Cheese Steak with fries? Or Canadian currency? Tubs
Oh be quiet Rosie, no one likes you anyway.
Love you Rosie.
I cannot wait for judge Gorsuchs appointment to the bench. Your obstructing wont work..  WINNING
Yes.  Thank you for your nearsightedness.  He is GOING to be confirmed either way.  Dems to lose even more in 2018.
Gorsuch is needed for this country! You aren't moved yet? You said you were.
Rosie aren't you missing out on a buffet bar somewhere? Got some kids to be screaming at?
irrelevant & impotent Dems... You can thank the divisive & extreme Pres. Obama for all of this.
shut up snowflake! Thought u were going to move to another country. Whoo Hoo! Go TrumPOTUS!!
#Oregon has a new hero tonight! Be proud of @SenJeffMerkley. Every @DNC this is how ALL @SenateDems should be!!! #resist
Rosie...no one gives a shit what you think... never has.
Why thank him for destroying America. They were just following what has happened in the past with Judges. Get a clue
@Robrt_M_Goldste @SenJeffMerkley DITTO! WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS.
Thank him all you want . It won't do any good . And Trump is still your President .
And Sheila Johnson is still a fool.
decent effort that!
TY for what? Protesting the now commy dem party trying 2 appoint another snowflake 2 decimate our constitution?
You would side with Hitler himself if he were advancing your agenda
stupidity on display
Rosie, does anyone really care about what YOU think? I mean seriously.
Get a life Rosie. The American People are sick of this whining.  It wasn't just the Repubs that stalled it was Obama
I'm proud to be an Oregonian 
You should mind your own business.
I thought you were mooooving?
Another celeb who thinks people care about what she has to say.
Rosie, please help me, we MUST Contact ALL GOP Senators to say #NOTNUCLEAR in order to save the Senate, kick McConnell OUT of Speaker, then.
You can thank Harry Reid for this. I'll bet you didn't call for his ouster.
Excuse me, that SCOTUS seat is OUR seat. You don't really give a cr@p about Garland. Move on...
Ms. O'Donnell. I used to laugh & scoff at you, thinking I understood the Joke that you were the butt of. Now I understand. I was wrong......
Good luck to you Personally.And a New effort to the American People to get through the next 4 years. Hopefully many less as info is released
