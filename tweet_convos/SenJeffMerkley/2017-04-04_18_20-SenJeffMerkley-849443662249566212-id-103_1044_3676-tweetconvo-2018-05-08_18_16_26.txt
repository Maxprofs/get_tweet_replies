.@SenJeffMerkley still way 2 avoid tragic misscarriage of justice happening: @SenateMajLdr change the nominee, not the rules. #SCOTUS
.@chrislhayes please help us get #holdthefloor trending by reporting #TheResistance is watching & supporting @SenJeffMerkley
GORSUCH HAS A 97% CONFIRMATION RECORD, WHICH MEANS THE LEFT APPOINTED JUDGES AGREED WITH HIM 97% OF THE TIME! THIS IS A FACT. #partisanbs
How is this helpful?  For my own edification why do we not have a straight up or down vote?  I'm an independent so I don't care about party
For anyone w/ doubts about the future of humanity, here is a reminder that it is the children who will lead us.
I made my 7yo watch for 6 whole minutes while I explained what was happening. Her comment? "Next time they should wear grown-up diapers." 
Well talk is cheap - and lord knows the Democratic Party is full of it
DOESN'T MATTER
Garland. A good man, a centrist who wasn't even given a hearing. R's decided to go nuclear when that happened.
Meanwhile I'm seeing pro-Gorsuch ads running on MSNBC. What the hell?
I'll #HOLDHISURINAL if he'll #HOLDTHEFLOOR #STOPGORSUCH
Merkley's Sanctuary City homelessVET'S live under bridges homeless camps closed in Portland Sanctuary  4 refugees & illegals
@ilyseh @SenJeffMerkley @SenateMajLdr  Any one betting GOP W
wont drop the bomb?
History will look back on these heroes from all walks of life. The Resistance
Proud to be in Oregon.
The problem is, he's like a radio station. He's been going for 4 hours but his play list is only 30 minutes long. #repeating
Are Merkley's fingers extra long? Or am I just too used to Trump's stubby short ones?
But people who live in Ohio and living pay check to pay check don't care about this. Isn't that right, Hayes?
That's what idiots do. They waste time instead of moving ahead!
That's MY Senator! Go @SenJeffMerkley
If you have to run ads then your nominee probably sucks and falls outside mainstream. They can't say it, but make no mistake, this is about
Gorsuch is bland as a refugee from Lake Woebgone--where all the women are strong, all the men good-looking & all the children above average.
This is the real purpose and meaning of filibuster, before the Rs changed it to allow a simple written objection as a substitute.
Dems are alienating themselves from avg voter even more and will lose more seats in 2018. Won't need the nuclear option then, super majority
who's bringing the diapers for the alt left tantrums. Hope you filibuster. Time to NUKE!
It was impressive.
Snowflakes crying because they can't get their way.
These plagiarism examples are bonkers
Fabulous! This is what democracy looks like!
god bless him.
They have to keep it going until Friday!
Read it. Re-read it. Then read it again. THE SENATE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE. IT IS NOT YOURS TO NUKE. #resist #resistance #StopGorsuch
dummy - you are the miscarriage of justice - -
I'm sure calling him a dummy will make Chris rethink his entire career and political ideology.
Proud to live in Oregon. #ResistGorsuch
@SenJeffMerkley rocks! Only senator to support Sanders on the primaries.
So embarrassing
Thank you Senator Merkely!
Wasting his time. Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch.
@SenJeffMerkley #resist And thank you

Very glad to see a few dems working for the ppl! Go Merkley!!
Oregon pride!!
#SusanRice
.@chrislhayes We are so proud to call him 'our' Senator. @SenJeffMerkley #holdthefloor #StopGorsuch
@SenJeffMerkley is #holdingthefloor! Showing the hypocrisy of not acting on a nom. during an election year! #WeThePeople
We agree.
Forget Judge Gorsuch--
Judge Posner For Justice Scalia's Supreme Court Seat

Breakup The 7th Ciruit!

@SenJeffMerkley #STANDINGWITHYOU
Merkley needs to employ a GOP tactic: repeat one thing over and over and over again to brainwash: "Change the nominee, not the rules"
Honestly, after a year of Trump, the word "conservative" will be an insult for the next 20 years. The Republicans are fools.
Thank you, Sen. Merkley! #resist
@SenJeffMerkley @RepAdamSchiff @MaxineWaters are just a few of #theResistance #heroes@!
Shucks. I <3 my Senators.
@SenJeffMerkley @SenateMajLdr The pro Gorsuch dark money ads feature him proudly recalling a ruling against disabled students.
Just called and thanked the senator!
So he will lose his fight and his voice...ok
Not quite on par with @dateline_keith, but he's got a decent enough voice.
TY @SenateDems. unfortunately @SenateMajLdr & @SenateGOP will not compromise they have 2 pack count 2 ensure their war on women & minorities
My hero!  What a guy.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley. You da man!
@SenJeffMerkley speaks truth: "The majority team in this chamber decided to steal a Supreme Court seat" #GorsuchNomination #filibuster
https://www.google.com/amp/nypost.com/2016/06/05/hollywoods-chavez-cheering-stars-venezuelas-victms/amp/ … Why do u never challenge Moore? Him ignoring the starving nation makes u look hypocritical.
Someone get that man a few Redbulls & Vodka!!
@SenJeffMerkley Thank you! A sitting president under FBI investigation DOES NOT get to appoint a supreme court justice #RussianTies
https://www.google.com/amp/nypost.com/2016/06/05/hollywoods-chavez-cheering-stars-venezuelas-victms/amp/ … KEEP INTERVIEWING @MMFLINT. SKIP VENEZUELA EVERY TIME. I'M SURE GETTING MOORE INPUT WILL HELP TRUMP.
Someone has to
Why?  Is Gorsuch unqualified or just politically unpalatable?
Both
@ilyseh @SenJeffMerkley @SenateMajLdr crap does this mean Gorsuch is not getting confirmed?
No, he will still be confirmed. Even Filibuster was symbolic, since everyone knew it would get killed as soon as used. Dems dealt bad hand
I'm having Flashbacks to the West Wing  - Stackhouse Filibuster
@ilyseh @SenJeffMerkley @SenateMajLdr
Someone should ask him why he's not demanding that Gorsuch be impeached & removed from the 10th circuit.
There's a major difference between the Supreme Court and a circuit court. I'll let you see if you can figure it out for yourself!
Dems are indicating that he has a corporate bias & is dangerous to democracy. Why leave him on the 10th circuit if he's compromised?
Mr. Merkley Goes to Washington. Proud to be a Democrat.
I'm so proud of my Senator
Yes!
So proud of my Senator!!!
Why not
If Rubio was president and Garland had been seated and Gorsuch was filling another vacancy, no Dem would have a problem with him.
This is about Garland and the fact that Dems absolutely loathe Trump. I get that, but they should at least admit it.
Meanwhile, in PA we are getting pummeled with TV ads to call our Senators to support his nomination. Who pays for this shit?
"Call"? Good luck with that. Toomey's office famously doesn't answer phone. Zero time for constituents. Not rich enough.
#OregonProud
This is the weirdest hill in the world to die on.
Go Senator Merkley !!!!    #respect
HOORAY; A MAN IN THE US CONGRESS
