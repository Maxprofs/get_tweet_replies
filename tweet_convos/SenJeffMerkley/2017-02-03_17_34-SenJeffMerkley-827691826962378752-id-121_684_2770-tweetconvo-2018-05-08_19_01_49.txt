standby for @realDonaldTrump to fire his attorneys for not being able to defend incompetent EO . #apprentice
the judge that ruled was a Bush appointee.There exist principled conservatives but not in gop
there is a little more complexity to what you call a ban but would not expect you to comprehend.
Thank Miltary giving lives protect you..Steven Gern,U.S. Marines in Iraq views on Ban https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piPex1CrTmU …
@LeahAnakin What constitutional "value" compels us to take in unvetted immigrants at our own peril?
You are NOT referring to the US Constitution. Go read it.
Tell the republicans to keep their crooked hands off my civil rights
do you like anal?
but how long before he with the republicans who no longer have integrity fill the benches with his ideological brethren?
You must not get out much
Crazy- NOT THANK YOU-Prefer the safer route since President has info we do not and WE elected him!
except he didnt rule for the constitution
@SenSchumer And your succumbing to the left!
@SenSchumer Pls follow ex & show us ACTION, not RHETORIC. U need 2B willing 2 put it all on the line like we are. #Partners
@SenSchumer thank you for speaking for us.  I am proud to be an Oregonian.
@SenSchumer Now you are showing public support for going against constitutional orders, wow Chuck
YOU called for extreme vetting in 2015, how come YOU Protest NOW, because you have 0 power that's why,irrelevant
Thank you so much, Senator - most Oregonians agree with your principled stands against the Bannon/Trump administration
Why was it ok when the muslim did it with the same countries but not now? Sounds like double standards! Shame!
@RonWyden @repblumenauer Clutching to the fantasy that islam is not a threat to the US, is unbelievably irresponsible.
The threat is EO that are unconstitutional. Sorry alt facts made you so scared.
Too bad your constitutional values aren't found anywhere in the United States Constitution.
totally the opposite, typical over reaching and substition of the commander in chief -but inserting personal view-so wrong
Hey American People Look At these Hypocrites that slander Trump. #YEYEEGF
@SenSchumer F-YOU!!!

With Robarts Horrible Judical Record. So Called Judge is actually a compliment.
does the Constitution of the US protect people who are not citizens?  Does it extend to other countries?
: What about the paid thugs rioting @ colleges, etc.  impacting our 1st Amendment rights, where is constitution protection?
Constitution protects AMERICANS correct? So this is not "unconstitutional " unless AMERICANS are denied entry
@SenSchumer democrats and MSM desperate to let in terrorists from countries even Obama labeled as high risk
@Ministerofblog @SenJeffMerkley and you studied constitutional law where?


i'll ask again. How does the order go against the constitution?
it doesn't Joe. It's just blind obstruction and they will pay for it come 2018!
payback sucks doesn't it?
Sorry but Judge Robart just reversed the score & gave it to the Falcons cause Patriots had to many white guys. Robart blows.
Can you send @realDonaldTrump a kids book about seperation of powers? Seems like he could use one right now.
thanks for all you do not just for Oregon but the entire country
@SenSchumer Think the Judge will cancel the SS cuts Obama made before leaving that become effective this month?
Why are you a Terrorist Supporter¿
@SenSchumer Principled?  It's political theater.  Thank u for the continued train wreck aka the Democratic Party. Clueless
@SenSchumer its legal just implemented sloppy. Instead of boycotts show america your willing to work for citizens not others
@SenSchumer Yes, thank-you. On behalf of our grandparents and our children.
and thank you senator Merkley for standing with us and doing the right thing. #Oregonproud
@SenSchumer Constututional values as seen by liberals. Interpretation depends on whic party nominated the Justice  Justice??
Chuck, thanking a judge for a favorable ruling shows you do not expect an impartial judiciary. Support @POTUS
thank you senator merkley for the steps you are taking to hold the Republicans accountable
@SenSchumer I think u should have unprincipled grandstanding egged on by rug head Washington AG
@SenSchumer have you lifelong politician leeches realized the bigger picture yet? We're tired of your ways, time to go
@SenSchumer What do you know about the constitution? You defecate on it every chance you get. #whyyoulost
@SenSchumer We need army of online psychiatrists psychologists and neuroscientists to help our weaker brethren gain insight.
@SenSchumer you mean political values
@SenSchumer And thank u Supreme Court justices for approving the murder of +40 million unborn
@SenSchumer thanks Judge Robart

@SenSchumer Judges are supposed to rule on LAW...not based on principals.
Please find some more people to vote against DeVoss...
You are wrong. When a country no longer controls its borders it ceases to be a country and simply becomes a "region".
Yes thanks to Judge Robart. Let us stand united and strong with JUDGE ROBART.
@SenSchumer this just shows dems have no regard for our safety, healthcare, rights, or women's rights.
@SenSchumer #Ur a WEAK INDIVIDUAL, the BAN, WAS JUST FOR AMERICA'S SAFETY, OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES R DOING THE SAME RIGHT NOW
@SenSchumer What law or part of the constitution was violated with the EO - Dem's don't even know what the law is 8USC1182
Since when did the 10th amendment become important to you?
@SenSchumer Dems are playing politics with American lives. We r on to your games. You will pay for it in 2018!
@SenSchumer please protect this judge. @realDonaldTrump has now endangered Robart's safety and security
@SenSchumer principal stand? I thought Judges didn't use principles, just facts. state constitutional values you speak of
Are you seeing a pattern here Chuck?
George W finally has something positive from his Presidency in he appointed Judge Robart
@SenSchumer hey senator
@SenSchumer Yes Thank you Judge Robert
@SenSchumer # Hey let's all go to the airports w signs n welcome them, let's gve the golden key to the city, FREE STARBUCKS!
thank you Senator for not being afraid to step forward and support visa & green card holders.  This EO is vile.
Let's hope you feel the same when a higher court over-turns this courts decision based on the Constitution.
@SenSchumer I am calling on investigation of #JudgeRobards with reviews of his bank accounts, emails with #DNC
@SenSchumer @SenJeffMerkley step down now judge you violated your oath of office
@SenSchumer # YEAH LET'S LET ALL OF THEM IN, NO LAW, UNEQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL, FREEDOM OF SPEECH GONE, CONSTITUTION GONE,
that's what the liberal thinks is good.
@SenSchumer  you have issues they're not in title 2 the Constitution they're not citizens.
But not on behalf of the American people. That aspect doesn't seem to be important in this discussion.
We need more people of principle to protect us from the evil which has been unleashed upon the land.
The Constitution doesn't apply to illegal aliens.
The American Constitution doesn't apply to foreigners in foreign countries, you treasonous boob.
Sorry Senator.
mid-terms
Because the ruling class live in gated communities many w/armed security. Activist judge & partisan senator obstructionist.
You got that right!
YES!!!! Stand!!!!!!!!
@2bitchsprinkles It's not over yet folks! Ciao Uno
thank you
more grand-standing
@RonWyden @repblumenauer jihad is happening in the US just as in dozens of other countries https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BwroQHEibOXlUTU1TDd4RjhzdDQ/edit?usp=sharing …
go West Coast. Stand up, speak up!
immigrants were routinely turned back from Ellis Island if there were concerns.  And that is right
look in the mirror to see the hater.
Short lived action judge overstep duties. Hope no terrorist action because of this. Terrorism exists. Inconvenience vs dead
There hasn't been a single American killed by refugees from the banned countries. Not one.
thank you!!!
democrat insurgents should leave America
obviously he can't comprehend the constitution any better than you president controls immigration
you will be remembered in history as the American jihadist who sold out America to the terrorist shame on you
I would like see where in Constitution give this judge the right to do this.this is a illegal act and it should not stand
Since when? Stop  with the KellyAnn Alternative facts
woo hoo!!!!
politics...that's his way of making judgement
What does this mean for the 4 month old Iranian infant who needs surgery at OHSU?
Can you cite where in US Constitution Robart based his decision on?  Article? Paragraph?  Pls. tell us.  Thanks!
Republicans need win only 24 more state legislative seats & they can amend constitution
