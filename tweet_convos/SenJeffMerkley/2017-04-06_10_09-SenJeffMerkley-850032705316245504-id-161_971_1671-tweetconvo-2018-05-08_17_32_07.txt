You are damaging to America and the constitution and the state of oregon.
He's a credit to the office, the state and the country.
Right.
Thanks for agreeing! 

(Honestly I do recognize sarcasm. Just couldn't resist.)
Thank Harry Reid you big doofus
Yes Thank you Evil Harry Reid for making life easier! 

The reasons Dems changed the rules about judicial nominees and why it's not the same as the @gop invoking the #NuclearOption. 
Yep it's always justified when your side does it
I think people wouldn't be so angry if McConnell had let Garland at least have hearings and a vote. #StolenSeat
It wasn't a stolen seat! He got Sotomayor and Kaegan sp.
So because he got 2 he doesn't get to fill a 3rd?  It was PRESIDENT Obama's duty to nominate & Congress's to vote. THEY DIDN'T DO THEIR DUTY
Scalia was a constitutionalist and the left could givea shit about that,the Republicans whowere told by Obama theywere in the back seat! NOT
Judge w integrity wd decline SCOTUS appt. under these circ's; Gorsuch & SCOTUS reputations now tarnished by this forever  @IndivisibleDuke
I think you forgot that your party changed the rules from a simple majority to a 60 vote requirement around 2003
Yes it is the same thing, it's changing the rules to suit your needs.
They set the rules back to where they were from the 1700's until Harry Reid changed them in 2003...they were being reset to original state
.@SenJeffMerkley @copperbird7 Profoundly damaging to the integrity of the Senate and entire Legislative Branch as well.
With Citizens United the Republicans made your government the finest that money can buy. You can't afford it!  Bought any defense stocks?
Everyone but the rich lose under tRump. We just pay his golf trips, wife's separate house
It's all about 2018. Get the young ones off their asses and out to vote. 50% female congress by 2020. GOP is the party of the wealthy only!
Why is it so damaging?  The filibuster for the Supreme Court has never been used before, chump never existed before 2003
When Don gets impeached, is there any way to remove Gorsuch?
For the first time in history we have a Putin Puppet in the WH. Now we know there will be one on supreme court. Sad
You sound like a seal barking the party line
Thank you I just love seals.
They passed Citizens United. Partly Responsible for how we got here. After that, I lost trust. It's all political now.
The USA does not even know how to spell 'integrity' now. I think they use this instead 'целостность' in Trump's regime.
its a new world. the rule of law is gone. Its the rule of alternate facts now.
the rule of law ended when you pretended that hillary caused benghazi when it was you and the other nazi traitor pedophiles who did it!
The plagiarism doesn't help either
Quit twisting facts, C. Thomas confirmed to #SCOTUS with 52 votes..the filibuster of nom the more unprecedented partisan act
Thanks for your hard work.
Forever more, tainted ***SCOTUS. 
Thanks Mitch and GOP
B _ _ _ _ _ _ S, rhymes with bitches
We need to vote in a more balanced legislation and the 60> vote for ALL judicial nominations be reinstated.
Root Cause of #USADemocracy eroding is #PartisanshipCancer.  #USADeserve all of us to ELIMINATE this Cancer.
It's "profoundly damaging" 
Drama much?
DISHONEST DISHONEST DISHONEST DISHONEST DISHONEST. 
UNLEARNED UNLEARNED UNLEARNED UNLEARNED UNLEARNED
FOOL!
you were just fine with it when Reid set it up & thought you Dems would be in power, live with it. quit pissin n moanin
No quit whining and change your vote. You are being hateful and vindictive, get over It!
Just going back to the way it was for 200 + years before dems raised the bar to stop Bush appointments...what goes around comes around
For 1st time in history a nominee was filibustered by partisan hacks like you. All on leftists Dems. #Resign #Frauds
Yes. The Senate and bipartisnship died today. SCOTUS is now the poltical arm of the Rethugs
INVALID ELECTION
So what can we do ?
only criminal democrats are allowed to change the rules grow up Trump won try being an adult
Mitch McConnell has ruined the Senate.
Yes! Thank you for the 15 hours of your time trying to do it correctly. This will be regrettted by everyone in the future.
Now every right wing Christian law will be imposed, anti environment, anti gay, anti abortion, anti science and racist We are the DSA
Send your thanks to Harry Reid
Our first 3/5th Supreme Court Justice.
thank you for your work in fighting this travesty
You stood up for all of us @SenJeffMerkley I think you deserve a break. Thank you
Along with so called pres DT* another * behind #SCOTUS*
Every single Republican senator is now permanently tied to Trump and their constituents need to be reminded all the time to vote them out!
It breaks my heart, but we could have asked no more of you - 16 hours! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You are helping to bend 1/
the long moral arc of this universe to justice - and we are right there with you. Thank you for being an example. 2/2
@SenateMajLdr  prevented Garland from a hearing, vowed to block any nominee Hillary's, so this is not surprising. #2018
Hypocrit!
2013
It's repulsive that you filibustered. Shame on the Democrats. Vote on him, up or down. Country first.  Trump games second. #Children.
Gorsuch is the 1st person nominated as an associate justice IN HISTORY to face a filibuster, evoking Cloture, so looks like we're even, pal.
@dmcrane Repubs couldn't care less abt #SCOTUS rep. They're all party & power before country. #unAmerican
Constitution specifically states when a 2/3 majority is required, and scotus confirmation is not one of them.
But we appreciate your hard work to avoid this situation.
america knew the reason for not seating garland n elected trump over your protest. it's dems that have damaged the integrity of the senate.
This was disgraceful. Republicans really must be held to account. They must step up and take responsibility for these sleazy maneuvers.
@realDonaldTrump and entire swamp has been profoundly damaging to the integrity of US. @SenateMajLdr is an unethical crook. @SecElaineChao
Clarence Thomas was confirmed 52-48. Lol
If you all weren't such partisans, this wouldn't have had to happen. You have only yourselves to blame.
Get over it winer
And for the first time in history in 2013 Harry Reid changed the rules to allow 51 votes to stop the same filibuster you'll have been doing,
#2018 if the Dems get control, you better be out for blood. Marc Anthony got it right is how I feel today.
"For 1st time in U.S. history, debate was just closed on #SCOTUS nominee with <60 votes."

Thanks to you, it won't be the last. 
What pick would Dems approve of by President Trump? Seriously, I can GUARANTEE NOT ONE IS ACCEPTABLE by the childish Dems...people see this!
Are there any dems who are honest?  You're such a liar just like the rest of your vile ilk. #DemsAreLiars

After refusing 79 lower court nominations, there wasn't much choice. NEVER considered for SCOTUS. Where have you been hiding?
I have been laying low, needed a break from politics for a while.  It was nice.  How are you doing?
Eh. I need a break from life.
For the first time in history, Dems filibustered a SCOTUS nominee. A nominee who received the highest possible rating from the ABA
Clarence Thomas confirmed with a 52-48 vote...know your history!
Now you know what it feels like to be steamrolled.
damage was done by Obama; he could have done the decent thing and not place a nominee, but Obama never chooses "the decent thing to do"!
What about Thomas 52 to 48
@SenateDems
No Senator. This is profoundly damaging 2 Dems
UR party nds 2 STOP w/the globalism & start acting 4 the Amer ppl
Your hypocritical partisan bloviating and actions is  what is damaging to SCOTUS and senate. If u had principle, u would NOT filibuster
Gee, just what Russia wants #WhataCoincidence #ComplicitGOP #traitors #CorruptionWins
Yes seat was stolen. And vote unprecedented. But let's not kid ourselves, 60 vote threshold is undemocratic. Then again the so is Senate.
Are you living under a rock? He spent 15+ hours very clearly pointing out what is wrong with #gorsuch on the senate floor. Watch C-SPAN2.
How many votes did Clarence Thomas get? #demslie #factcheck #fakenews
AND damaging to the integrity of @SenateMajLdr and @SenateGOP   Just a bunch of cheaters with no ethics. Fake Christians and Fake Americans!
bullshit. What would have been damaging is had the seat remained open because of politics
You know that it never says - women- in the Constitution. Just -men, man. You ready to lose all your rights cause you're a woman? #realnews
The court has lost any faith and trust they had left.  No opinion from them will have any good faith from the people.
"Leader" in title only.  @SenateMajLdr SHOULD BE ASHAMED of himself.  Clearly THE biggest OBSTRUCTIONIST & liar in US Senate history.
Very disappointing, but it is temporary. Republicans will lose control of the Senate in mid-term elections & future seats will be ours.
Suck it up snowflakes ahahaha
Thank u Harry Reid!!!! U dimwits really know how to screw the American ppl
Says the party with no integrity.
The damage started with you Democrats.  You should all be removed.  Your hatred for our Constitution is disgraceful.
You know that it never says - women- in the Constitution. Just -men, man. You ready to lose all your rights cause you're a woman? #realnews
Thank You Harry Reid
It's official we don't live in a Democracy any longer. $$ and greed win out over American lives!! :(
We never did live in a democracy.  The US is a Constitutional Republic.  Has been since our founding.
Along with Bush v Gore; VRA gutting; Citizens United; Corps are people whose bigotry is religion & money speech
McConnell destroyed integrity of SCt. when he stole Garland's seat.
Tough that the Reid Rule is now coming back to bite you?  Elections have consequences and keep that in mind!!!
Yes, thanks to Democrats and Liberals who refuse to uphold the Constitution.  They are causing great damage.
You know that it never says - women- in the Constitution. Just -men, man. You ready to lose all your rights cause you're a woman? #realnews
prior to 2002 supreme court needed just simple majority learn history
Yeah, you should have voted for Justice Gorsuch, you all are to partisian! Plus hes way smarter than you!
You and your colleagues didn't have the integrity to keep Harry Reid from nuke option in 2013, Dems are responsible for this
Again mis-truth by you. List votes for all current SCOTUS! @SenateMajLdr  @SenateGOP we must speak the truth! @GOP
Then Dems should have voted this oncoming judge in and not fight every step of the way.
You know that it never says - women- in the Constitution. Just -men, man. You ready to lose all your rights cause you're a woman? #realnews
Jeff you sponsored legislation in 2013 to do the same thing.  Hypocrite.
Source.
really - is the integrity of all other nominations damaged due to Democrats changing the rules 4 years ago???????? #hypocrite
More like FIRST time in history that there was a partisan filibuster.
You know that it never says - women- in the Constitution. Just -men, man. You ready to lose all your rights cause you're a woman? #realnews
First (and last) time there was a partisan filibuster of a SC nomination. You Dems ruin everything.
Thank you.
The majority of the Senate AND the majority of Americans want an extremely qualified judge confirmed, and his confirmation is damaging? ok..
I'm grateful you tried your hardest @SenJeffMerkley.
Alito, Thomas... the 60 vote majority was a rule change in itself and not in the Constitution.
So Happy I live in the United States of Goldman Sachs.
for the first time in history a partisan filibuster was mounted against a well qualified nominee to #SCOTUS. Shame on you.
Yeah. Please tell us about the nominee who was denied a vote? Go on. Enlighten us oh sayer of judicial wisdom.
policy students around the world are teached about democracy in the US! This is bad news, real BAD news!
Apparently not taught English?
May he pass many good decisions. One to limit terms, another demanding all Feds use o'care, third, make u.s. follow laws, not give mes.
and the integrity of our entire congress. Term limits a must moving forward to stop such corruption
I want to replace the senate that did this. That will be my mission.
Ill have to disagree
Make America Great Again
check your facts...2 currently sitting received less than 60 votes
Get a life loser! No one Trump would put up would be good enough. Democrats have done this damage. blood is on their hands
when dems return to power (&they will) we'll get our turn finally. it's not like clarence thomas will live forever
You did what you could Sir. Thank you!!
SCOTUS integrity much higher than US Senate.  Sadly true. The US Senate "may" find integrity soon? Today, a step in correct direction.
You know that it never says - women- in the Constitution. Just -men, man. You ready to lose all your rights cause you're a woman? #realnews
Democrats have themselves to blame. They have been corrupting the process since the Bork nomination.
Oregon is simply a suburb of Los Angeles now, next is annexation
Wtg 
... and the foolish actions of worthless Jeff have disenfranchised the voters of Oregon in picking the SCOTUS nominee. We need #TermLimits
No, this is profoundly damaging to the integrity of the Dums.  Get over yourself.
McConnell's Hatred of Obama just killed the Senate Tradition. Republicans will live to rue the day they were taken in by hatred.
Wasn't it the Dems who changed the confirmations rules in 2013?  or was that OK, but this is end of the world
You are terrible on your historic facts. Or just blatantly lying.
All the Dems should just not show up for the final vote ...
And stomp their feet too!
Thank Harry Reid. When will the democrats look in the mirror to see what is wrong?  You keep losing people for your party everyday. Good job
2013
This is rallying cry for the next election!
Blame yourself #StupidOnPurpose Jeff, you called for filibuster before Gorsuch was announced. Actions have consequences....
... and the foolish actions of worthless Jeff have disenfranchised the voters of Oregon in picking the SCOTUS nominee. We need #TermLimits
No; as we know why, and it has nothing to do with him.
#StolenSeat #BogusCourt
We love you here in /r/Portland!
Not to mention what is left of @GOP @gop integrity. Thanks for the good fight just the same Senator Merkley.
Integrity of all 3 branches profoundly damaged. You did your best Senator.
I am so sad. We stayed up with you and felt someone on the opposing side would come around to reason. But don't give up!!
Thank you for your efforts to retain integrity of the Senate and #SCOTUS. We won't forget. @SenateDems @SenSchumer #TheResistance
where were you 4 years ago when the Dems changed the rules on other confirmations?
There hasn't been any integrity of scotus since Clarence Thomas was sworn in. Citizens United has destroyed our democracy.
In fact, the 60 vote number was another Democrat tactic. There is no 60 vote requirement for #SCOTUS confirmation. #Dishonest.
Does anyone think this will be the last centuries-old great American institution to be obliterated as soon as Trump makes contact with it?
Trump had nothing to do with this.  It is Harry Reid and the Dems who did this.
Supreme Court was already compromised.  Citizens United proved that.  This was just one more small step toward feudalism.
No it's not. There was no valid reason to oppose Gorsuch for #SCOTUS. Partisan obstruction is not a valid reason. We put a stop to it.
You're profoundly damaging to the senate
Profoundly damaging to idea of US democracy as it once stood
Please!!
