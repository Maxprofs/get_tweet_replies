WTF.. ITS YOUR JOB TO BE  IN EVERY MEETING ABOUT H/C THERE ... WHAT THE HELL R U DOING #UNFIT#RESIGN
you was in the room praising him .. how can you praising a person you don't know ?
Get him!!!
"I would suggest you read the house bill since you're the Secretary of Health." That was awesome!  Thanks Senator for standing up for us!
Won't be long universal care only solution like rest of the World let All pay
The @rnc hasn't sent him his talking points yet
Yeah...but he has that bullshit-politispeak down PAT!  @GOP
Thank @SenJeffMerkley for asking the tough questions and exposing this plan for what it is.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for speaking up for Oregonians. AHCA would devastate health care in rural Oregon.
Merkley.... pit bull for "we the people" !
Thank you sir.
THANK YOU SENATOR!!
And I guess we just forgot all about Price's insider trading and votes to enrich himself? GOP=EVIL
you let him off easy lol

Hey Lefty!!! Luv GIF!!
Hah! You're too young to remember that.
To be fair, Trump is not his boss, the American people are.
No republicans think trump is, but I think just unit for the power and $
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley shame on you @SecPriceMD shame on you all for taking away my parents healthcare.
"Does not compute does not compute"
Is there anyone in Trump's cabinet that doesn't look like a good ol' boy?
I'm in California; Medi-CAL isn't affected by revenue grubbing Republicans, who care for their lobbyists, NOT their constituents. Inhumane.
As usual, Merkley gives us the best example of why we need term limits
PRICE IS A SWEATY WARTHOG.
Tom Price is as dumb as a bucket of rocks and a loyal sycophant of trump
@SenJeffMerkley ty
Thank you Sen Merkley. You are representing many of us in states who have worthless senators!
Thank you for your good work, sir! A lot of non-answer answers from GOP as usual.  SecPrice -at least read the bill.  What an embarrassment!
Wow somebody got stuffed in a locker and deservedly so for a change.
What is it w/these people not being able to say "yes" or "no"? You don't need to be in a mtg to know whether you agree w/ a comment or not.
Ouch, that's gotta hurt!
Fools
The monumental and massive stupidity of Tom Price on full display here.
Thank you for helping the American people understand @SecPriceMD's apparent indifference on this issue.
"It does indeed." Much more eloquent a directive statement than any from our current President.
Thrilled with your tough questions to these OBSTRUCTIONISTS !
You have no time to hear more BS from them, thank God.
THANK YOU
#republicare not #trumpcare
@laureldavilacpa @SecPriceMD well done!!
Thank you and keep up the pressure. Proud of my Oregon Senators.
Americans are not surprised by the bill being prepared by the GOP is intended to kill citizens raise rates cause economy to suffer more ppl
Will have to bankrupt ect.  While their underhanded plan the oath of office is to protect the constitution and to remember the ppl are their
Boss.  The oath of protecting Americans is an oath to the GOP is being ignored and the GOP needs to be penalized. Taking Money would work
He can't be blamed.  He was busy thinking about ways to praise 45 in their next Cabinet meeting. @POTUS
Force vote Senate stop all Sessions and All GOP BILLS WHILE INVESTIGATION IS ON GOING!
How can they try and push a Bill that will take healthcare away from 23+ million Americans? It will be the single worst Bill in US history!!
Thank you for your continued efforts to provide health care equitably for all Americans.
Merkley is a POS the Democrat Party is the New Domestic Terrorist Party
Go @SenJeffMerkley - Oregon's hero!
Very nice work Senator. Love to see you make cretins like Price try to defend disastrous legislation like the AHCA. Thanks.
Of course it's mean ! It's a tax cut bill! For guys like you, sir. But Mr.President, we talked about this! Your supposed to say it's better
Smirk.
That was awesome Sir, please keep it up
Thank your Senator Merkley for standing up for hard working Americans who rely on access to affordable health insurance for our health care.
What a weakling Price is! Doesn't know what's in his own bill & has only weasel words "I disagree with your characterization" as his reply.
@SenJeffMerkley Wow, I am so glad that you represent us! Thank you.
Lol @SenJeffMerkley is a fool vote your #criminalparty and fools.home 

Wish they can go to jail first 

Some.will
Mean is an understatement. It is an atrocity on the American people. The House Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.
You destroyed and owned him
If you were a woman, some would call you "hysterical"
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley 

Trump words kinda like weather if u don't like his words now wait just a few tweets and those words will change
@bannerite @SecPriceMD thank you Senator Merkley
Every so often Herr Trump forgets and inadvertently says something that true.
I believe DoD's major Contribution to FAR was holding 'Industry Days" to gain insights. CA's reliance on Referendums s/b used by Lawmakers.
Senator, Price has to read it first not just rubber stamp it for Trump.
Keep up the good work @SenJeffMerkley , @Sen @RonWyden . Hold them accountable on #TrumpCare.
Thank u Sen 4 fighting 4 the Am ppl.
This is a truly disgusting and stunning performance by Secretary Price. This regime is one heinous person after another.
It a Circus without The Ringmaster
Can the Dems introduce 299 amendments and use vote a Rama to stall HC to say 2018
Thank you Senator Merkley for stand up against the GOP issued genocide.
All Healthcare Bills from the Republicans are MEAN! & they are Not Healthcare they are Tax Cuts for 1%
Why can't you be my senator?
THANK YOU!!!  For all you do for us. THANK YOU.
? Um, the GOP has the majority and the Democrats can't do anything except to try getting some GOP members to wake up and do what's right.
In a time of unbelievable chicanery, I am still amazed that a "health care plan" depriving millions of care is being hatched in secret.
@SenJeffMerkley PLEASE help #VoteYourOssoff trend. New poll has handel tied & we know to turn the tide against a trump America starts here!
And what are you doing to make it better?
Great job highlighting the 'mean' republican health care bill-it will be devastating for all except the richest Americans
Keep fighting for our health!
hmm did @SecPriceMD learn the "I only know what I read in the papers" line from Sessions?
And THAT'S what we call PRICELESS..!
Thank you Senator Merkley for speaking out on behalf of all Americans against this cold-hearted, MEAN for-profit scam. #Merkley2020 #Resist
What to go @SenJeffMerkley!!!  Making @SecPriceMD own it.
Thank you senator Merkley!
The republicans know people will die.They say they want unity, but GOP Senate won't debate the bill with Democrats. Stop voting for the GOP!
Thank you. Good job Sen Merkley.
That was beautiful to see.
Blind hog find acorn sometime
We are ALL so screwed if you can't stop this from becoming law.
At what point did politicians forget how to answer questions? #TrumpCare #DumpTrump
When they decided not to be transparent.
That's great but tweets are going to stop it. We need a united Dem party committing to withholding consent & filibuster by amendment
God is Price weak. Weak in his knowledge and lacking any discernible backbone.
Sec Price is stumped on everything unless it involves lining his and his cronies pockets.
Thank you for calling out hypocrisy, sir!
Boy these SOB's can't answer a question...stonewalling constantly ..this health bill will effect ALL of us...r premiums, drugs, tests, etc..
Thank you for persisting!

Awesome job Senator Merkley!  I am so proud to have you as my Senator.  Keep up the good fight!
Get him!!! Thank you @SenJeffMerkley
Snuck in some questions before @SenJohnMcCain showed up and told you to shut up, too, I see. @SenKamalaHarris wasn't so lucky. Twice.
Thank you, Senator. You are a great Oregonian
thank you for presenting the data so clearly. @SecPriceMD Shame on you. No ability to be logical?
Great line of questioning, Senator! These are the answers the American people need about the AHCA.
Great questions thank you @SenJeffMerkley .. Awesome job for America
Keep it up, Sir, and thank you!
Nice job, Senator! You guys are speaking for all Americans!
Trump refers 2 .@SpeakerRyan @GOP House passed #TrumpCare Bill as "mean". Bet Senate's secret Health Care Bill will be nice Tax Cuts 4 Rich!
Go get 'em, @SenJeffMerkley! Thank you for fighting for us.
