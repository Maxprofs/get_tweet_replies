Why should hardworking Americans fund tax cuts for the wealthy, like @realDonaldTrump? That’s what Trump’s #taxreform plan is really about.
I'm sure you'd vote for tax increases, tax and spend is the dems motto.
Great idea if we can find a way to tax the 50% of the population that pay ZERO. The1% are the backbone of America. #noclue
R u including children and seniors in that 50%?
Children and seniors are included in all the benefits the 1% pay for!!!!
There are many 1%ers that get it, think they need to contribute more than Joe6pack. They understand that the only job creator is a customer.
The #1 job killer is the federal, state and local government.
A thriving business will only hire/fire based on number of customers. The rest is fine tuning.
Government never created a customer. Only creates regulation
Regulations force biz to hire more to monitor/comply with said regulations.They then cry and fool many into thinking regs kill jobs
And u are sure about that !!
Trumpenomic bull that will increase the national debt. Losing $200 billion in corporate taxation can not be recouped elsewhere!
No its close loopholes of you giving to the hillary foundation for a writeoff and she donates to you for a writeoff even though not charity
@POTUS rally ILLEGAL! He made it political and attacks a US SENATOR!! Hold him accountable #FakePresident
Praying for a red trifecta in Oregon
What you plan to do is make sure no tax reform takes place and the OBUMMER legacy of no growth continues.   How much is your book deal?
The Democrats have wanted tax reform for a long time, but the R's won't have it. They want tax cuts for the wealthy & corporations
@boredlatenight @realDonaldTru They want to fuck common americans into oblivion,they could give a fuck less about us People?
TrumpTax is an abomination Eliminates deduction for head of household & earned income credits hurting low & middle income families
You mean your yearly lottery jackpot from the others working so you can get a new tv or vacation to Disney land. That is what i see it do.
Are you even expressing a coherent thought? What do you mean?
No more tax cuts for the wealthy and offshore entities! #notonepenny #It'sAnAmericanThing
We are being guided by the greediest WH ever!
The 1% pay most of taxes. Better to have money into economy than into Washington. Did any poor person give you a job
Exactly. This did not work under Reagan or Bush won't work now. This is vad policy and we all know it.
EVERYTHING he has done & is aspiring to do is for himself & his wealthy friends. So when his tail is thrown out, he is set! I HATE TRUMP!
I am pretty sure he was set before he accepted the position.

Exactly my sentiment
Own a home? # of dependents? Annual salary? Are you a vet? Taxes done! Shouldnt need h&r block or lawyer. Kiss. keep it simple stupid
You helped create this mess. @POTUS is trying to fix it. #MAGA
Come on, Jeff.  You can do better than talking points.  How exactly does his plan do that? Specifics not the same bs talking points
Really means 'do your part' !
The house and Senate received an outline on tax reform.  H & S filled in blanks.  Who is the real cheats here? #DrainTheSwamp
OMG just like healthcare the bashing starts before you see the plan.
#NotOnePenny   Amen!!!
Yet the current tax code is breaking the middle class turning them into the lower 20%.  Like I say #WORTHLESSSENATOR #ALLTALK
And you tax plan is grab more tax money to spend on people who don't pay taxes
His corp should donate to Harvey relief. Get proof.
u need to be less polite when u write lets say how it really is
Shameful that's all I have to say
Do tax code votes require simple majority or super majority?
Thank you for fighting for the 99%, Senator. We're behind you!
He wants to put people to work reducing burden, increasing payers, reducing individual demand, empowering people and dissolving ur base
Trickle down does not work as seen in Kansas & Louisiana whose GOP governors ran their economies into a ditch. Greedy build larger castles.
I want one of those Republican jokers to look me, a single parent, in the eye and tell me WHY they think it's OK to take away HOH status.
Half of America doesn't pay taxes, that's the problem. My family doesn't make much $, but I don't expect rich people to pay my share. Crazy
I agree.  They think if they make it simpler to file we won't notice we are paying more.
Yes!  Trump is a con man without heart
We all know @realDonaldTrump doesn't pay taxes and we have yet to see his returns! Mueller will handle that!
Show us your TAXES Trump. Why should we agree to tax changes without seeing how much more money you will make on our backs.
Where is all the winning fr the financially struggling Trump voter? GOP&Trump tax plan screws them over&they still defend Trump!
You just don't get it.
Trump will be impeached before they get a tax build through or arrested OR keep your fingers crossed both
Which member of @GOP did you talk with today about impeachment? Tweet that!!!! @SenJeffMerkley
Anyone with even a partially functioning brain knows trumps tax plan is is nothing more than a money grab for rich folks. #trumpeduptaxplan
What is it with you libs.... are you out of talking points? Are you just a bunch of parrots? What? Same bs line EVERY time
You left out the part that Republicans think voter's are stupid and will buy this plan that has no common sense
Please keep ringing the bell.
***Winner***
besides his plan to do this is saying it. This poor fool thinks something he said makes it true.
What's less than 0%?
Progressive BS.
Billionaires are not anyone's friend, unless, of course, you're also a billionaire.
Why are you lying? President Trump specifically said the 1% will have their loop holes closed.
You know the 1% pay less taxes than those who make less than 1 million annually. Tax system favors them. 15% flat tax brings in more revenue
get on board w/ #FAIRtax  w/3 diff % brackets, eliminate most tax cuts & make our lives easier, put more $$ in our pocket Instead of whining
They pay most of the taxes so it makes sense that they would get break.
R U f'ing nuts/ignorant as hell?The rich use loopholes & tax shelters & overseas banks to pay 0-very low taxes! 0 for co's & mega churches!
Of course. His plan is to save more money for himself and the 1% while the middle class covers all the crap they pass for themselves.
Those crawling in the swamp want to eliminate middle class. Preach about rich poor gap widening while they are cranking the jack. They own u
Right, and I will donate heavily to his next winning campaign.
That's how it always works so long as the rich are happy
#TaxReform =  
→ Lower rate for the wealthy  
→ Simple code of big tax breaks for corporations  
→ More jobs overseas. @TPM @msnbc @NYT
Yea, he kept all his promises to his supporters.
As if they even follow those rules anyway. Most of them use offshore tax havens. This is mostly to make the middlemen happy.
Wrong!.
I’m convinced!.
