@heysyd @GOP can never be trusted again! Whatever level of govtFIGHT!!!
Proud to be an Oregonian! Thank you for doing this
This is exactly correct.  They will feel entitled to get away with stealing SCOTUS nominees every time.
Just made a donation at https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/donatemerkley?refcode=www â€¦ @sacca have you?
How about you, @PadmaLakshmi ?
@jonfavs @jonlovett where do I donate to whoever is running against McConnell in KY next time he's up?
Thank you, Senator Merkley.
Hopefully the MP's will be coming to take them away very soon!
How can I thank you enough for being a man of conviction and courage? We need more like you in Washington. When u run again, I'll donate.
Dont let them! Gr8t work!
You are doing great. Keep going.
They won't have the majority for much longer, I can assure you. Thank you for your efforts, Senator!
Great job! That you for standing up for us!
So was it theft when Harry Reid changed the rules to benefit @BarackObama's nominees? #karma
You're the man, senator! Thank you! #holdthefloor
$17 Million reasons to Block Gorsuch #HoldTheFloor
No theft and you know it Gorsuch MUST be confirmed..
If the GOP continues to lie to us, we have a right to protest them through marches and sue them in court. Class action suits?
I stand with you
Theatrics!  You've got a talent for talking out of both sides of your mouth.
EXACTLY!!!!!
SCOTUS = *SCOTUS
SANS GARLAND
Thank you @MajorityL  and @GOP
Stand strong for America.  I fear our democracy may be in jeopardy.
Your side used this option first. Payback hurts
Nothing as long as GOP control the house n senate
Nothing! We hope to have 2 more conservatives on the court in 4 years and in 8 years possibly more! Normalcy returned to our nation!
Thank you Senator for speaking out against those who seek to destroy our nation, and for speaking UP for our democracy
GO SEN MERKLEY!  SINK THE TRAITORS!
Read "Green Eggs and Ham"! The R's will support that.
The answer is: The 2018 mid-Terms.
Thank you Senator for all you are doing to stand up for us ! God bless you for talking all night !
Hell they stole the Oval Office; this doesn't surprise me at all! When will our leaders start putting our country first? I'm over D.C
Thank you for showing committed leadership!
We have these things called "elections" where voters -- the people you work for -- can decide these things. @SenJeffMerkley
Awesome. Am with you all the way.
Trump won the election. Get over it.
Quit your Whining you have no one to blame but you & the rest of you LibTurds pretty  soon we will make you all just a bad memory
Way to go Senator. We stand behind you!
Sensing a Merkley/Shiff ticket, 2020. Merkley/Kamala Harris. Doesn't matter the order, they're each emerging from this nightmare as heroes.
Give 'me hell, Senator Merkley!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley, make them pay for theft.
Thank you from Texas! 
Yeah.....kind of the point. See you like judges that write law we like them to just rule on it after we the people write it.
. @SenJeffMerkley nothing.  They're stone cold criminals that like to get pissed on by Russians.
Whose idea was it to change the rules from requiring 60 votes? Oh yeah! Dems'! Thanks guys!
Imagine how you would howl in derision if conservatives had said those same words about Obama's SCOTUS nominees.
Thank you!!
Proud to be your constituent and supporter! Thank you!!
Thanks Senator!!! Thanks for standing up for justice!
THANK YOU - you stand for us!  Literally

What did they steal and from whom? Please reference the Constitution when making your answer.
Stay strong Senator! 
@kenyabrunson Voters in 2018 & 2020 we would hope, pray & vitally act!
Thank you for protecting our rights and democracy.#StopGorsuch #votenotoGorsuch

Thank YOU.
Thank you, Senator Merkley!!! 
Love, America
Your WA neighbors support you! #StopGorsuch
You've just shown our nation is very lucky not to have @HillaryClinton in the #WhiteHouse and @TheDemocRats in control of both houses! #MAGA
Not a damned thing.  Thank you for standing up and speaking up for us, Sen. Merkley!!!
Hopefully, the people who vote for these GOP senators will realize this. But I fear that it's too late.
Well there is taking back the senate and leaving future vacancies up to the voters.
#StandWithMerkley
#TaintedJustice
#TrumpRussiaCollusion
@laureldavilacpa yeah like the way they have been committed Treason over the last 50years and Dems have let them get away wi

#MAGA
Keep going Nuke
Thank you so much you make us all very proud.
How are you going to stop him. Any republicans that will vote against him? We r doing everything we can.
Thank you for fighting for American people versus the greedy GOP party!
This coming from a snake in the grass with ZERO INTEGRITY.
Thank you, Sen. Merkley, for standing up for your country and all of us!
EXACTLY. Thank you Senator Merkley!!
Thank you!
That was information you might have shared with Harry Reid in 2013 and Chuck Schumer in 2007.  Now you reap what you sowed.
Bullshit

Should have told harry Reid that!  
I feel pride in and through your actions. You are an inspiration. Thank you so much Senator! .@SenJeffMerkley
Thank you, Sen. Merkley.  I'm a Coloradan and wish @SenBennetCO would join the filibuster!
THANK YOU for standing up for democracy!

Shut up already! History now! Stand up for what's right NOW!!
TY @SenJeffMerkley  Majority Leader McConnell Owns this since he declared his intentions B4 President Obama's Nominee was even considered
Nothing.
XlntTY Sen Merkley for standing up,calling out McConnells failure for no hearing on Judge Merrick Garland.Gorsuch is not scotus material!
Thank you! #HoldtheFloor
Absolutely nothing! Flip the Congress - throw the bums out!
Gorsuch doesn't mind occupying a stolen seat on the bench-so much for his integrity-thank Sen Merkley for real integrity.
You are a true patriot.  I wish you strength + steadfastness.
Thank you, Senator!!!
#holdthefloor
Thank you, sir!
!FIGHT!!FIGHT!!FIGHT!
What's at stake: majority rule & the future of the US.
The majority won't stand another decade of "conservative" rule.
Thank you!  We are with you in spirit!  #StopGorsuch #holdthefloor
Integrity of the democrats is at stake. You look like fools
thank you for doing this!!!
Cheers Senator Merkley! 
Thank you from Massachusetts!
How is it a theft exactly? No better qualified judge out there!!!
Thank for #holdingthefloor
I am so proud to have voted for one of the remaining strong Democratic senators out there! Proud Oregonian. Proud American.
Didn't stop democrats from using it? Double standard I think so
They're going to do it. It's all about what Dems do when they're back in power. All Dems have to stand together!
Thank you, sir, for holding the floor!
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley! Heard about your filibuster efforts on @maddow's show tonight. You make this OR constituent proud!
Behind you all the way.
@Celeste_pewter hell yeah! Thanks from an Oregonian. 
Like you wouldn't have done the same had the roles been reversed.
Hang in there, Sen Merkley.  Thank you so much!!
Go Jeff!!! Making all of us Oregonians so proud
Thank you so much!
Precisely & they'll do it again!
They're officially the #GOPLawbreakers not lawmakers. Voters, kick them out at midterms.
Us. We stop them. Then we destroy them. And then wait 70 years for their asses to claw their way back. Rinse. Repeat.
Thank you Senator!  Your Country needs you!
we support you!
Same song over and over again. Vote him in
Proud to call you my Senator.  Keep up the amazing work; we all stand with you.
Thank you Jeff! I'm proud you are my senator!
Thank you Senator.
They feel entitled
TY @SenJeffMerkley for standing against illegitimate administration's SCOTUS nominee.
Love it. Thanks @SenJeffMerkley
Thank you for saying this out loud, no disclaimers. GOP crocodile tears about death of bipartisanship are absolutely sickening. #stolenseat
Maybe you should have given more thought to the consequences of changing the Senate rules. You created your own problem here.
No, sir. Your #stupidrepublicanparty did that. #thanksnothanks
Proud of you, literally standing up for our country!!!
Thank you!!!
GO JEFF GO!
They don't care about anything. Oh - except money.
GO Senator Merkley!! Thank you!!
We stand tall with you @SenJeffMerkley ! #holdthefloor #TheResistance
Illegitimate president's nominee being pushed thru by partisan power hungry Senate. #TrumpRussia Constitutional Crisis. US Leaders Rise Up!
Thank you Senator Merkley!
Thank you from Maine - Lots of support from FB advocacy groups here!
KEEP GOING!!!!
How is it theft? #gorsuch was unanimously approved in 2006! & it was the 7th time the senate left a #SCOTUS open during an election year
I'm not from Oregon, but the constitution & democracy is for all of us. We have 2 all have each other's back. Thank u for your ur support.
#2018Takeover
Thank you for your courage and integrity! We're watching.
Yes, & R's started this partisan politics when they denied Garland vote. Public faith in SCOTUS damaged 1,now 2x?Change to consensus nominee
How many times did they obstruct under Obama...lower courts, but never gave Garland a blink. GOP will own the Nuke...for all time. Thank you
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for your dedication to this country!
Keep it up, senator!
Keep it going big dog
Or the republicans don't think they will ever be the minority party again.
Yes. The GOP do not care about citizens. The majority of  U S is middle left.  GOP only listen to the money that comes from big business.
That's my senator proud Oregonian here if they go nuclear then they can't stop us from filling seats either.
What stopped the democrats from doing the same in 2013? @oreillyfactor
So if it's a "theft" does that make Harry Reid a crime boss?   #BendOver #Ready4Gorush
stand on #principle! #Gorsuch is merely #interpretive #robot, of a kind @Scotus does not need-Besides, his seat is #stolen. @SenJeffMerkley
Thank you Senator Merkley. 
#Resist 
#Persist
#standupandbeheard
Thank you for speaking for everyone. Not just your constituents.
Only as long as they're in power, which will be NFL.
why did the dems change the rules?? Doesn't this make it easier for the Republicans now??
Godspeed! Thank you for standing 4 something
Keep going...we know you're tired ...PERSIST!!!
Ask your former leader, Harry Reid.  What goes around comes around.
Thank you so much for standing strong! #FilibusterGorsuch
Thank You! Appreciate your efforts!
Thank you.
THANK YOU, Sir! Stand tall. We are with you! 
Keep it up!
#holdthefloor
Thank you for your tireless service, sir!
Fool!
We stop them by running against them and getting everybody off their butts to vote.
No, in true Dem fashion they'll just continue importing ringers to vote Dem until the original country is swamped beyond recognition.
Can't really get more swamped than it is.
Thank you
I will stay up with you. Thank you for retelling the story about why Gorsuch is not justice material. Shame on the pro voters. Shame on all
So proud and thankful for the work you are doing!
You are a super hero, Senator Merkley! Thank you for your tremendous action tonight on the Senate floor. Proud to be your constituent.  
You represent me well! Thank you.
You and Bernie should go on a road trip! You'll revive the Democratic Party !
I think it may have more to do with the republican redistricting effort...we have to stop this locally.
Excellent point!
Excellent point......If you're an idiot.
Or not an Oregonian, lol!
Thank you for defending the cause
THANK YOU THANK YOU Hang tough
Can't put that genie back in the bottle. Only good news is when we take our country back they will regret this.
