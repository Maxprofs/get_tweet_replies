Sir, you are a rockstar!
keep going #holdthefloor ! Showing my two Boys what  passion for other peoples lives can look like!
Do you even know where Oregon is, let alone how it feels about this?
don't listen to him. He's a troll. 2018 democrats are going to take back a whole lot of seats.
You must have missed all of the protests. The pendulum swings back hard.
Sure must be mmm-tasty to live life swallowing every spoonful of bull crap Alex Jones and Steve Bannon feed you.
You are an inspiration!  Hey Texas, this is what a Senator looks like.  Not @JohnCornyn or @SenTedCruz.  We'll fix that next time!
Beto O'Rourke!
You stopped talking, but I don't understand what's happened?
How sad, we wish you loved our Constitution....Gorsuch MUST be confirmed...

Thank you, Senator.

#KimJhongDrumpfDoesNotDeserveASupremeCourtPickInLastYearOfPredidencyHaHa!
Thank you!
You, sir, rock. Thank you for standing on principle when most people can't, won't, or dont. Plus, the dude's a plagiarist!
u own the website...very poor behavior
Thank you.
3) or this? “The filibuster, once used only on issues of personal principle, is now used regularly as an instrument of partisan politics,”..
I love watching Jeff Merkley trying to bail out Harry Reid's sinking boat with a thimble. I guess Dems never figured on losing the election
Ok you know this is pointless. He is going on the court ether way. Why not put your efforts to more important things like fixing Obamacare?
Thank you, sir! Proud and thankful that you're my Senator! #StopGorsuch #holdthefloor
you are AMAZING! Keep it up! 
I commend you for your passion sir . But it won't stop them will it ? They will just go nuclear .
Hahahahah  won't change nothing
So you were AGAINST the filibuster when Republicans were doing it, but now you are FOR the filibuster when Democrats are doing it. #FlipFlop
thank you. My kids went to bed watching and awoke amazed at your commitment. Thank you. We Oregonians support you!
2) ..to do its job. Reform the filibuster and allow a fair up or down vote on the important issues.” Sen. Merkley, 2013
1) Remember this, Senator: "It’s time to end the political games that have hijacked the U.S. Senate. We demand rules that allow the Senate..
Dude, you still have a website dedicated to reforming the filibuster. 
Go, Jeff. You're doing all the things I hoped when I vote for you each time.
Thank you! Keep it up
made my daughters watch this morning over breakfast. Went off to school yelling #holdthefloor !
Love this 
Mr. Merkley goes to Washington...shades of Jimmy Stewart. Keep it up!

Which member of Merkley's staff gets to tell him that the actual filibuster is on Thursday? Are you guys drawing straws or...?
Thank you Oregon for voting this man in! What a warrior.

Thank you, Senator Merkley. Not only are you brave & persistent, but you've used the last 16 hours to show why he's the wrong choice.

I'm so proud that you are my Senator. Thank you for this amazing effort.

Who wants to watch a fool blather on and on, pure politics run amuck. Congress is far too partisan, stop it and b a grown up, yes 4 Gorsuch
great job! keep it going
Keep it up! You're doing us proud!  #WeNeedYou
Just read @Khanoisseur tweets on Russia and the timelines.
This is one impressive display of what democracy should look like. #holdthefloor #StopGorsuch
Keep hydrating!
bring on the nuke. Democrats who won't confirm a guy who has highest bar rating.... Screw dems
Immense gratitude, sir!
Thank you for representing the good people of this country and standing against Gorsuch. You make me proud to be a Democrat! #NoToGorsuch
Keep it up!  Good work.  Need Senators to stand up for the #gops destruction of Senate rules.
I'm on the west coast and had to go to bed during livestream... holy crap! :o
Go Senator Merkley @SenJeffMerkley we need more & more just like you! #StopGorsuch
BOOM!  Nuke it!  Proof positive who haven't done a damn thing since being in Washington.
TY for giving energy to  #StopGorsuch, @SenJeffMerkley! Now that u r done, hope u r ready to play hardball. E.g., shut up @SenateMajLdr 1/
because after this speech, he'll be violating the two-speech rule if he talks again on #Gorsuch prior to the Senate adjourning. 2/2
You are my hero! I slept back here in #Oregon and woke to find you're stilling #holdingthefloor!  #holdthefloor #StopGorsuch

You are awesome!  Excellent job and proud of you.
I thought filibusters were conceptual these days, that you just indicated you'd filibuster and that was it, no marathon involved.
I voted for you. I cant thank you enough. Stay strong!  #holdthefloor #GarlandNotGorsuch
thank you and good job
Proud that you are representing my great state of Oregon!  Thank you for your service.

A filibuster machine. Keep freebooting the floor for justice! #holdthefloor #StopGorsuch #NoSuchSCOTUS

Apart from endurance, what impresses me is you're staying on topic when you could literally be reading Green Eggs & Ham.  #HoldTheFloor
Much admiration for your Herculean task. I shudder at the thought of responsibility resting on you & your colleagues. Worse of Trump wins.
Thank you!
Incredible!  Thank you!!!  #HoldTheFloor
I would send you a coffee if I could!
SEN MERKLEY... TELL HOW GORSUCH PLAGERIZED HIS BOOK!! HE IS UNETHICAL AND APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED BECAUSE OF THIS VERY THING!!
#holdthefloor Senator 
No SCOTUS nomination from a POTUS under FBI investigation
You ROCK! Keep fighting for a legitimate SCOTUS nominee #SCOTUS #NoGorsuch #TheRevolution
Go Jeff, we love you!
You are  true patriot,sir.#holdthefloor
