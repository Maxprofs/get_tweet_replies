What price is your soul?
the @GOP need to bribe their own members to get them to vote on terrible #TrumpCare - pathetic
Begs the question, how much does big business spend on lobbying, political 'support', & advertising to afford less taxes & more US dollars?
Those who voted Trump and those who voted against Hillary wanted what was promised, repeal. Nothing less will do.
Thank you for fighting this! The healthcare part of AHCA is bad enough, but GOP needs to explain the tax cuts, which is their real priority.
Why not put that money to help the poor children and the sick in our country? Wow, are you a child of God? Judgement Day!
Wow, Merkley lovers are all a bunch of socialists wanting to suck on the teat of big gov't. Sickening & Un-American. Bunch of takers.
How bout they just take care of their constituents?
Just whose millions is he ready to spend?
Kind of like all the side deals the Dems demand to keep government open
Watch "Lincoln". Money and backroom deals were how the 13th Ammendment was passed. Can we fight money with money, just this once?
Billions
#MeanMitch certainly has $millions from #Lobbyists & #TheOnePercent. @SenateGOP #CorruptRepublicans #NoTrumpCare #SwingBlue #TheResistance
It'll be political suicide if those Senators come back from break and change their minds and vote FOR AHCA.  FOLLOW THE MONEY
@SenateMajLdr spending blood money. No funds for Medicaid but plenty to buy votes that will result in thousands of deaths #disgusting
Thank you for your fight on this. Keep it up and know your constituents are with you!
If they have any morals left, they will choose people over money. OR face the wrath of its citizens
Whose millions is he spending? Obviously it will be taxpayers money so it will be made public, correct?
Disgusting
And the Mercers via their America First Policies, Inc.
It's dead on arrival.
They always want to line their own pocket
You brought Americans the worst health care bill imaginable. Stop with your lies. You have zero credibility on this issue. ZERO!
We need drug price reform. Medicare and Medicaid should be able to negotiate prices.
The fact that votes can be bought should disturb us all
Great. Spending more of our taxpayer money to try and pass a bill that will redirect more of our money to wealthy Americans. Disgusting.
just fix Obamacare. It works well and u don't have 2 reinvent the wheel. Trumpcare is abysmal &  not getting better
Just fix voting machines and district lines so we can have a real democracy
Enact  #AmeriCare Health Care Act of 2009
They are buying the deaths of millions. Way to go GOP.
Yep. He is wily & cunning. The depths his dastardly desperation will let him to descend know no bounds. Underestimation is a grave mistake.
#passthebill
They r going to the back room & buying votes. Straight graft & corruption. They r disgusting POS'
He's going 2 bribe, buy or bully his colleagues 2 get those votes. Can't  let up -  can't let it happen
Just shows they want a victory no matter the cost to the American people.  Shameful.

I guess bribery isn't illegal?
How is this even LEGAL??????
BREAKING NEWS: #MitchMcConnell  #Obama  & a #Trumpster  explain #Trumpcare.

#ACHA #satire #ACA #Obamacare
What do we want? Medicare for all! When do we want it? ASAP. First world countries care for their people's health needs.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vowel and a vote." 
Bribery!
That is horrible..to spend millions to pass a bill that takes HC away from millions
I think you misspelled billions.
Minor setback for the invincible #Trumpcare!
WHO DO THESE FUCKS WORK FOR?! THIS IS OUR MONEY, GUYS. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO SAY WHERE IT GOES.
It better not be Taxpayers dollars, it would be like paying for our own death sentence.
God, just let it die, let the bill die & burn in the round file it belongs in, also the bill totally violates the inalienable rights 1/2
The right to life, liberty & the persute of happi- IT'S THE FIRST ONE!!! 

2/2
Holy fuck how disgusting are these guys?! How is it ok that they TELL US THEY DO THIS?! Millions to buy votes but no healthcare.
So the @SenateMajLdr is resorting to bribes. That's how bad the #HealthcareBill is. #LetThemEatCake #TaxBreaksForTheRich
Bribes, Bullying and BS...the 45 GOP way
Millions orBillions?
How much will it cost for these senators to allow thousands to die? @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenatorCollins @timkaine @SenBobCasey
Winning a battle is great, but we ate going to win the war too. FIGHT ON! 
Swampy
Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley #OregonProud
The time has come to get rid of congress members that can't work together as a team.
If they have so much money to spend to secure votes, why don't they do the right (human) thing & devote that money to paying for healthcare?
These 2 so called conservatives will sell out first.
Get out there and kill it. Get on every news network with the facts. Every day. Get it in all the papers. Go to other states and town hall.
@SenateMajLdr @GOP THIS IS A CORRUPT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS. IT IS ONLY ABOUT @POTUS WIN, politics not legislation.
So they are going to try and bribe their way to passing it.  How very Trump.
No resting #NotThisBill
It will be billions.
Yes. Very deep pockets and a willingness to #bribe GOP senators to do something that they know is not in the national interest. Shame.
Asshats all of them
Thank God for the Republicans in Congress who declined to go along with this bill. I wish they'd had the vote, so I knew who they were.
Drain the Swamp they say!
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THIS!! Please keep up the pressure and we will too!!
Awful
Have billions to bribe Senators to pass giant tax break to bribe people with millions/billions for their votes/donations. Scheming fucks.
Everyone should go to any Republican's town hall and protest (that's if they have the courage to hold one).
With all of this hide & seek health care bill scam we  don't see anything what is going on with our military fighting as we speak
@RogueNASA @SenateMajLdr @politico good to know they will spend millions to make sure millions lose (their healthcare)
The GOP is owned by big business and the Koch Bros. That makes them dangerous to our Democracy. This is wrong and needs to change, Jeff.
This is political theater. Repubs  will restore 200 billof 800 bill tax cut to Medicaid "only" take 18 million insur & claim to have a heart
It took $8B in amendment to pass AHCA in the House, is Senate a "cheaper date"? Don't be fooled giant tax cut will pass. #BestGovMoneyCanBuy
Millions in our money going to states so ther rep will support a tax break for the rich bill
wonder where Mitch is getting that money (Koch/Mercer) cough cough  #voteNO @SenDeanHeller #NV
The Mercers and their dangerous liaisons playbook for need to go...
The house will vote it down hopefully but McConnell has to get 51 votes for @GOP in 18 so he'll pull out the pork to get moderates on board.
So they can't afford to cover healthcare costs, but they have enough to line their pockets to ensure their shitty bill goes through? #Bribes
politico?  another national enquirer...
So bribery?
.As usual, the @GOP is for sale.
Of course he is..  thank you for fighting for us sir.
Just like Trump buys his own books, TrumPublicans will buy their own bill. As in "You Break it, You Own It."
Nasty piece of work for sure.
I'm not calling for a new revolution but the way the far right GOP is gutting the American middle class...
They're willing to spend millions because the Ins. Comps & Rich that make cash off this savage bill will give @GOP 10x that in dividends.
Prepared to spend millions, just not on heal care and protections.  He's a horrible human
@zandywithaz @SenateMajLdr @politico of course it's not dead. Just a bit of theater
If you have to BUY votes, doesn't that mean the bill is inherently bad?
It would be great if those billions went towards #SinglePayer.
Millions, billions whatever...
Pathetic 
Where do these millions come from?
Unfortunately its millions of our dollars being passed around to enrich them.
So there's no tax money for Medicaid expansion and social programs but plenty to buy votes with.
So outright bribery then? I guess that's what America has come to... Time to start learning Chinese I guess.
Bribery the GOP way they can't formulate anything legitimately
So bribes for votes. Gotta love modern day politics.
why not spend millions on healthcare coverage?
So the millions that could actually go into needed programs instead will buy votes.  Just sick.
Why is @SenateMajLdr going to spend millions in taxpayer dollars to force unwanted legislation down our throats?
I won't stop fighting and calling until we have single payer healthcare.
Unbelievable. No wait. Very believable
Spend=bribe.
That was my thought.
