Defying GOP, @SenJeffMerkley reads a letter by Coretta Scott King on the U.S. Senate floor. @coreypein reports. http://www.wweek.com/news/2017/02/07/jeff-merkley-defies-senate-republican-leader-by-reading-coretta-scott-kings-words-on-the-floor-of-congress/ … 
So, why can the man read it but not the woman?
.@notmargot663 @SenWarren @SenJeffMerkley I don't understand that part either!?
What is the answer to this question? Please. @stephaniebogus @notmargot663
because penises are magic? If so, been using mine wrong...
Apparently it works as a microphone too. Who knew?!
There are certainly a lot of them being waived around in the White House these days.
keep turning up the heat
Great job in persisting but why wasn't the male senator thrown out??
.@SenWarren @pdca92260 @SenJeffMerkley But SHAMEFUL How ASS @SenateMajLdr CENSORED a WOMAN!
.@SenWarren @pdca92260 @SenJeffMerkley Maybe that's why the ass @SenateMajLdr got himself a Chinese wife; yep I said it.
Keep fighting Senators! We've got your backs! Thanks!
Oregon Rocks! So proud of my senator AND Governor (Kate Brown)!!!!
that is all u know is Coretta Scott King, try thinking for yourself.  I know it is hard.
thank you!
@AaronMesh @coreypein # Warren you lost again! LOOSER
thank you Senators! Keep fighting.
why were the male Senators not silenced too? Don't you think that makes it twice as despicable ?@SenateMajLdr
Absoltuley I do!
thank you Elizabeth. You have to run in 2020
not a chance
Good work Senator Merkley!! This was an outrage.
are you able to clarify how he was able to read it and not you?
@Noneofy84387293 @SenJeffMerkley Jokeahauntus is an embarrassing fool
thank you!
SHAMEFUL of you, to ignore the rules. Lieawatha, just STOP, you've been disproven.
@AaronMesh @coreypein Getting really desperate are you! You people label others with your own character flaws!
@AaronMesh @coreypein So proud he is an Oregonian and we worked on his first campaign for senator.
why is it okay for a man to speak her words??
Thank ypu for being our voices!!!!!
That guy is ON FIRE (as you are) and I'm so happy to be one of his constituents.
Well played guys. That was very inspiring.
Thank YOU, Senator Warren, for your grace and tenacity! You will 4ever be embraced and remembered for this moment
You Des.founders of KKK, voters against the Civil Rights Bill need to work for American Blacks.
Thank you Jeff Merkley!!
I don't get it. How did @SenJeffMerkley not get muzzled but you did?  @SenateMajLdr this seems undemocratic and misogynistic.
@AaronMesh @coreypein Elizabeth Warren you shouldn't read that damn thing Like that not call Jeff a racist
usually when someone calls another person's a racist there racist them self  Y R A racist
and I hope they vote your ass out in 2018
@PopuliAtheist @SenJeffMerkley thank you @SenWarren for standing up for those words in the face of such bigotry.
women's rights equate to humanities betterment, suffrage ended, really???
@AaronMesh @coreypein Very commendable of the Senator but WHY were you not allowed to speak?
so it's ok for a man to read her letter but not a woman. Thank you Sen Mesh
Well done!
I am grateful the words were spoke aloud. Am angry misogyny still runs that blatantly rampant.
@AaronMesh @coreypein 
Thank you for standing up for all of us
The people see through Mitch McConnell.  At least the thinking ones see through him.
thanks to both
if your the opposition party just think about the collateral damage your words have. Change is all about action!
God bless you both for tirelessly fighting for the citizens of the United States #Resist
I don't think it was letter as much as you saying Jeff sessions was a disgrace that got you banned.
America Thanks you!  God Bless you!
thank you both for fighting for us!
seems they have a problem with a woman standing up for what's right
thank you thank you!
So they let all these men read it, but not you?
Next time replace the podium with a stove, come in barefoot and pregnant and maybe Mitch will pay some attention.
Your race-baiting nonsense has been exposed as a fraud.
Hey gop.  you  don't get to hide & protect your party's racism!
@strongmajority @SenJeffMerkley @AaronMesh @coreypein Don't forget to also thank Sen. Tom Udall, D-NM.
He read it. So why did Elizabeth allow child molesters to stop her????
You must be more of a threat to the GOP than @SenJeffMerkley , or they just wised up.
@AaronMesh @coreypein Maybe u should tone it down abit.
wonderful. Please keep it up. So proud of you.
I'm with her! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
And why wasn't he blocked from the Senate floor?! (I'm glad he wasn't) Cuz McC is sexist! #TrumpNewWorldOrder
No Senator in debate shall impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or  unbecoming a Senator
You can 'defy' @GOP w/30yr old words, but you FAILED to block @SenatorSessions. Not a winning strategy.
@AaronMesh @coreypein too bad you dems weren't this passionate about Lynch #liberalhypocrisy
thes men need 2 b heardhttps://youtu.be/J3Wm06ufYSU
Funny how a bunch of old men didn't want a woman to read, but another man can!!! SMh
thank you for taking a stand.  We need more Dems like you.
I'm proud to be an Oregonian right now.
While @SenateMajLdr is . Proving this man has no dick. Keep up the fight! @SenWarren 

#letlizspeak and #shutmcconnell up!
Hey,  why was he allowed to read it?
Thank you for standing up against those who tried to silence Senator Warren!
The ones thanking @SenatorSessions? http://truepundit.com/shattered-video-of-coretta-scott-king-thanking-jeff-sessions-for-rosa-parks-library-crushes-elizabeth-warren-racial-stunt/ …
Do I smell a @SenWarren @SenJeffMerkley ticket for 2020? Sniff sniff. Smells like justice.
. Happy for the support but didn't she get to finish...
... Elizabeth & Bernie for president that would put this country on the right track with everyone included.
You are a class act!! #LetLizSpeak #StopSessions
Hell yea.
What if you bought a penis and brought it with you? Maybe they'd let you speak then.
they are really afraid of women!
@AaronMesh @coreypein Thank you Senator Merkley. All of your colleagues should follow.
@the_moviebob @SenJeffMerkley @AaronMesh @coreypein persist
He is a real patriot and a real man TY!
What Mitch McConnell did to you and the American people was shameful and will not be forgotten
the Republicans feel should have the right.  Only Republicans.
It's interesting that after silencing @SenWarren, they let several men read the letter..  (but thanks for reading it also!)
By voting as the Republicans did when voting Senator Warren off the floor, it has been made clear exactly who
@AaronMesh @coreypein that's OUR MAN #jeffmerkley #onehonestdude
You really are working for that black vote in 2020 aren't you. Sorry, anything you do is politically motivated.
@damonbethea1 @SenJeffMerkley @AaronMesh @coreypein 
good for you #youAreInGreatCompany #ThePeoplesHeroes #theyCantShutUsAll #Filibuster #Resist @TheDemocrats
@AaronMesh @coreypein              Thank you!!!
What McConnell did last night was sexist. Senator Warren did not violate Senate rules. Truth over prohibition.
Thank you Senator Merkley of Oregon.
@jimmyj48125 @SenJeffMerkley Are there absolutely no @GOP senators with a conscience??? @CNN @ReutersWorld @AP @BBCWorld @nytimes
absolutely none!
thank you both for persisting,  NEVER GIVE UP
@AaronMesh @coreypein
I watched Senator Udall do same thing, why no love for him?  @now7grandkids @SenJeffMerkley
That's my state Senator right there! Apparently free speech does not exist if you're a Democrat. Keep fighting!
we will do everything that you are doing now but 10 times worse
and where a Democrat wins office again the Republicans have a long memory payback will come next time a democrat
you need to stop playing games do the nation's business remember election is coming up in 4 years a
Warren is a cheap shot artist.  Broke rules.  Knowing she could use C.S.K. as excuse.  Sick
The Senate silencing @SenWarren is a violation of our first amendment rights since she was speaking as a representative of all us!
of course they let a man read it. #GOP #Manspeak
@AaronMesh @coreypein https://twitter.com/i/moments/829331869174988800 …
Merkley is the MAN! #oregon
Thank you both.
THIS is how you do it!
lady gaga knew it was time. Crazzie lizxie give up you lost  $millonloan you got friend  foe of wall street loud mouth hypocrite
continue to read this to the public in every way possible. Never stop
thanks to you both for working hard on behalf of real Americans!
@LorettaBower3 @SenJeffMerkley you saying they did not silence the white man? No more of this bull It is time to rise ladies.
thank you both for consistently speaking out against the authoritarianism of this new, appalling administration.
. We know who the real snowflakes are Mitch McConnell. A face off w/ the power of women. #Misogyny #TheResistance
It's good to see Dems standing up for what is right and having Sen Warrens back. #proud
@LindaRN111 @SenJeffMerkley  you will not be re-elected
Sen Merkley has guts & brass Integrity all that's missing @ WH
So, why was he allowed to read the letter ?
Misogyny & bigotry flourishes in GOP   #CorettaKingSpeaks #Elizabeth
Agreed, but it should have been you @SenWarren.
- By denying Warren the right to read CSK's letter, McConnell ended up making a big deal out of it. Well done...
- Senators Warren and Merkley!
thank you both.
Proud of u both!
Thank you!!!! Oregon is watching you! Making us proud!
thank you Sen Warren and Sen Merkley for your integrity and persistence to do what's right for all people.
Thank you for standing up and doing the right thing.  #letlizspeak
obstructor nasty and mentally insane woman that decides to do her job when she did nothing in the previous 8years
When discussion is about Session's cabinet nomination, statements made r not against the Senator but the nominee

SHATTERED: Video of Coretta Scott King Thanking Jeff Sessions for Rosa Parks Library Crushes Liz Warren Racial Stunt http://truepundit.com/shattered-video-of-coretta-scott-king-thanking-jeff-sessions-for-rosa-parks-library-crushes-elizabeth-warren-racial-stunt/ …

Thank you for #NoSessions #Ivote #WhyIMarch
Defies nothing. Her violation was before that.
Thank you both for standing up!
Thank you both for your good work. Do not be silenced, do not be cowed. We are behind you.
Yes, great job, but notable that you, a woman, were silenced, and he, a man, wasn't.
u could have done it urself Pocahontas but u chose your BS rhetoric you were shut down!
Keep up the good work! Proud of my @SenJeffMerkley and of you Senator @SenWarren
Impugning of Senator by exposing his racism? Reps don't want facts. This is Rule 19 all over. No to Sessions.
Thank you both for your efforts to get justice for all of us.
was voted in to make America great again you people are not going to make America a 3 Rd world country any more
#ThankYou @SenWarren @SenJeffMerkley  ... #ShameOnYou #SenMitchMcConnel! Why #silence a #women?!?! #ShePersisted #Justice #Equality for ALL
Thanks to you both for sharing important information
What? You mean her words weren't banned? That means, GASP, you broke the rules and had to suffer the consequence!
proud of you both for standing up
@cwindt99 @SenJeffMerkley @AaronMesh  pathetic he could say them but a female wasnt allowed 2speak? Work Equality laws? Lawsuit?
I'm not big on suing but at this point we have to do whatever we can legally 2stop this!
Thank you for all you are doing!!! You are a true hero.
Thank you Mam! You unmasked @SenateMajLdr 's true colors..we can now add sexistto his resume. @SenJeffMerkley thank you!
Absolutely. Thank you.
you think you can do whatever you want!  Enough of this BS

Warren, we all see through your acts. 2020.. it's a joke.. you are so far left, never get the votes.
unbelievable! #LetLizSpeak #ShePersisted
Thank you to our courageous Senators!
Thank you!
