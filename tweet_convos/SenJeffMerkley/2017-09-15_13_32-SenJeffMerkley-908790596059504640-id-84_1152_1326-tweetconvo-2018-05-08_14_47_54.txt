YOUR efforts helped #KillTheBill the last time around. Let's do it again. #GrahamCassidy
Once again, old white men try to ram thru a devastating bill for women, children, elderly, sick & vets. GOP isn't pro-life, it's pro-money.
Pro  responsibility! !
CALL YOUR REPUBLICAN SENATORS AND SAY NO TO THE DISASTER KNOWN AS GRAHAM-CASSIDY
CALL YOUR GOVERNOR'S REGARDLESS OF PARTY @JohnKasich @MassGovernor @JerryBrownGov @RoyCooperNC @AkGovBillWalker @dougducey @BrianSandoval
These "senators" should be ashamed.  But, of course, they're not.  Immoral, inhumane, decidedly GOP.
Hear my voice! REMEMBER ME! The average working class stiff when you get to our forefathers kingdom..it is to work for us.From the bottom up
It stinks. Shut on down...

#ObamaCare → #TrumpCare → #RyanCare → #NoOneCare… https://twitter.com/i/web/status/877296879419240449 …
Thank you for your hard work to defeat the @GOP efforts to promote business well being over people's health and well being
Wow! You are not working with our President! RT to the millions of Trump supporters!
Here's an idea on #Healthcare: what if we all stopped fighting and actually compromised?
#PurpleHealthcare 
#CassidyGraham 
#bipartisan
#ACA
PurpleHealthCare is better known as JunkHealthCare, high cost plans to prop up the health insurance companies.  Lobbyists wrote it.
Can you explain what you mean? This was my first broad attempt at a compromise that would please both sides.
Thanks Senator, you always lead the way.
Here you go Trump supporter, this is what we are getting from the right as well! Our President is on his own! No support from the Reps
Senator Jeff! You are not for the people! MAGA!
Thanks, Senator. We've got your back. This one sounds even worse than the others. kill the zombie!
You snowflakes? ?? Help I can't do it!
Please point out DT campaigned on single payer-didn't call it that but that's what he described
The first of many last ditch efforts!
Are you going to riot again?
Root and branch! ! !
They are hell bent on giving backers that 50k check
Why don't you participate in the needed change and help us all instead of obstructing the process participate in the process, puppet!
@LindseyGrahamSC are you out of your mind take from democratic states to give to republican states wtf is wrong with you we r people
We do not want TrumpCare, it's mean, covers less, more people w/o coverage, cost more ultimately. Just adjust/fix the ACA.
Uugh, I know they have better things to do.
Their refusal to hear the voices of the people  will mark the end of the Republican Party!
@LindseyGrahamSC introduced his new new "kill the poor" #Trumpcare bill. They seem to be hell bent on causing maximum carnage in America.
How many last ditch efforts can there be?  I've lost track of how many there have been.
Give 'em H E double toothpicks, Senator! #NoTrumpCare #MeanMitch @POTUS #INCOMPETENT @SenateGOP #Heartless @realDonaldTrump #FakePresident
That monkey business with Bernie has gotta stop. You will lose more than just an election
Yes, it's better to let it implode and kill the middle class
Maybe you can say 'white people' will be able to get health insurance,  then your base would be REAL upset! BTW, Venezuela doing GREAT
For your record, put me in the "keep your grubby paws off our Obamacare" column.
Take away their healthcare insurance
I fear chaos and death. Obfuscation and lies. We cannot rely on investigations and hope. We must win elections. Unite or die
Sweep 2018/2020
Will do. It's time to call our Senators and say NO!
We hate the ACA
At this point I'd rather live with NO healthcare than be surrounded by ruthless, violent thugs on the LEFT! Y'all Hav gone too far
So desperately need Obamacare. Personally and nationally. It has made an incredible difference in my family's life.


Oh, really! These Republicans really suck I know there isn't a benevolent God as they would have perished from this Earth.We are on our own
Repeal Obamacare now! The time is long passed to put this shitty law out of our collective misery.
Why? Why? Why? ...
This will continue until.
What the heck Lindsey Graham?!
Then HELP THE PEOPLE find something do-able instead of bitching about it!
When you come up with something manageable...... then you'll have my undivided attention. My working class parents ca NOT afford this.
I just heard no pre-existing conditions...SURPRISE!
#GetOnIt
Just the thought of having to say "TRUMPCARE" will make me sick enough to have to go to the Doctor. Just say No to Trumpcare!
Just enough by still hearing about Obama care makes us sick in the stomach! You traitors! MAGA!
#Election2018 #election2018 voter imposed #Termlimits  time to clean house.


You created this mess. It's on you.
Obamacare Fiasco Monster is Still on our Back w/ Premiums going up 20%/year & Jeff wants to nationalize Healthcare like VA where Vets Die!
Why don't we just get rid of Trump first and then healthcare may be easier.
these are the ppl that want to take your healthcare to give corps,ins companies and the 1% tax breaks. people get smart, blame the real 1's
Insanity to its core. GOP is anti human.
You talking to Murkowski, Collins & other GOP members to stop this bill-which strips 32M of health ins. & will kill more than ISIS hope for?
Help him change our insurance!!! Some idiots in Congress want us all to all be in Medicare . Medicare stinks !
This is exhausting
Why are you trying to stick us with that monster of a disaster known as Obamacare? When It ultimately fails can we hold you accountable?
Senator, please tell POTUS that passing #MedicareForAll will give him good media coverage. he might actually commit to it! 
Why is it so important that these guys need to screw with people. Put lives on the line?
Yes, thank you.
what are you for #ACA or #MedicareForAll  you are all over the place
I left a message for you and many others. NO to Graham s horrible plan
Coming from a senator who is cosponsoring medicare for all defeat the competition.
This is never gonna end huh?
Obama care is great? Why do i pay 14000 for a plan with 3500 ded? Worst plan ever. Stop acting like a humanitarian
The only monsters are senate democrats playing politics and obstruction instead of helping Americans by fixing failing obamacare.
