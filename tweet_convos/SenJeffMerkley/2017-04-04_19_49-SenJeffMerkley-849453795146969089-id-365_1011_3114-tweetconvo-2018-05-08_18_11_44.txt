@BewareTheBeliev  Sen Merkley was elected to work fir the people not to engage in standing on floor. Who is he working for?
Hang in there!

Stand strong!
@megsailors Way to represent Oregon! 
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! Trump has NO RIGHT to appoint anyone, especially SCOTUS! Thank you! Support HR 669 to stop POTUS from launching nukes
Thank you!
Awesome!  Thank you!!
3 cheers! Bravo!
Thank you for speaking out. We need more like you to take a stand.
Hip-hip-hurray! Good for you. Good for us. Good for everybody. Thank you for dedicating yourself.
Thank you!
Thank you for standing up for us! You rock!
Thank you Senator Merkley! We remember how Republicans obstructed/refused 2 meet w/ #MerrickGarland @GOP set awful precedent #StopGorsuch
How can we as Americans accept the appointment of anyone from a POTUS who's being investigated by the FBI for treason?
I'm not one of your constituents but Thank You!
the feed has stopped, can it be seen anywhere else?
Nice!
Still playing the fool eh Jeff? 
Only a COWARD filibusters...too 'ascared' to hear the roll called.
(& that includes GOP also)
The GOP has 56 votes; they need 60 to confirm. W/o filibuster, they'll change rule to majority. Read a paper!
Thank you for this
A true American. Thank you.
You are amazing. Thank you. Thank you very much.
THank you.  We are supporting you.  # stolen seat

And they continue to ignore that they have to go nuclear like children because they refused to vote on a 2-term president's nomination.
Dems don't like their own rules used against them. #BidenRule 
If you're talking about what the GOP did to Garland, that's not the "Biden rule."
#AmericanHero

Thank you!
Nice job Senator Merkley! You make Oregon Proud to have you as our Senator.
He is now as embarrassing & pretentious as he was when he demanded women on duty, military & LE, be allowed to breast feed
Fool
God forbid a mother should feed her child & supply better nutrients!

Hang in there! (& thank you!)
Thank you for your committment!
