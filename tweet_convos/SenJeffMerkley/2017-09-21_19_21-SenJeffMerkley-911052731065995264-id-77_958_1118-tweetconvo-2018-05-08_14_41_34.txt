Oregon hardest-hit state in US under GOP's new health care bill http://bit.ly/2fbtFEm  pic.twitter.com/XXDWS8EuGj
Punishing states who expanded Medicaid appropriately, and who contribute more in taxes than they receive in federal aid, provokes secession.
I just looked at the map and thought , 'Omg, we are going to have another civil war"
The Civil War never ended. It just went underground.
Households will gladly take all that money rerouted from state government. Lower priced, enterprise-grade healthcare will beat Medicaid too!
such a terrible deal for states that had the good sense & foresight to opt into the Medicaid expansion; thank you for being so tenacious.
It is clear that this bill is intended to punish blue states & reward red states. Why else is Texas a winner & Oregon & Cal are big losers.
I would be happy to shift the federal tax I'm pay to Oregon State tax to compensate for this. :)
Take the money you waste on illegals and non us citizens and use it the way it was intended and report back.
Please explain how people keeping ones own money is a problem?
#KillTheBill
And WHY? So that Republicans can get their palms greased by the #KochBrothers
Thanks for exposing the cost. Thanks for fighting the good fight.
Yet they had no problem voting for an increase in military spending. How are we going to pay for it?! The question never asked w/ military$.
Allows, not mandates. We can spend our own $ on whatever we choose,as a ppl. If you prefer to kill ppl rather than help them,just say so.
What do you mean loses? Is that money that is not being stolen from taxpayers. How do you lose something that's not yours?
Democrats are for Open Borders, more socialism, higher taxes and fewer jobs. No thanks
This is a horrible bill, Oregon would be loosing 13 billions, they are lying to us about what's covered
Here's the Kaiser Fam Fdn map. I don't see how we Dems can fight when R's are giving money away.http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/state-by-state-estimates-of-changes-in-federal-spending-on-health-care-under-the-graham-cassidy-bill/ …
The # of Americans covered by Medicare/caid increased 38% from 2008-2015. Death rates rose for the 1st time in over a decade in 2015.
Maybe people are getting older? What about the care they got over that time with Medicare? Would death rates go up without it?
We Oregonians know you and Sen. Wyden will vote against. THANK YOU!! Who else should we call?
Vote Republican. #DrainTheSwamp #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Now I know why my family on Oregon are fighting this bill. They will lose money. Let the state subsidize itself. Live with your decisions!
Why do democrats support higher taxes on the companies we work at. Don't they understand that hurts Americans
and this will be a death sentence for many
We doubt that.
Doesn't chart show California losing more ?
Can you say blue state?
@Oregonian looks like a "F" you to Calif too and a gift to red states shocking
Secession will fix this.
You created this mess. It's on you.pic.twitter.com/IIYRkXFpRx
The government shouldn't be paying for our health care, we should pay for our own health care. Fight to bring down the cost of healthcare.
but will it cover #HerpesHillary
I'd like to see charges brought against Graham and/or anyone who bribes/extorts in order to get bills passed.Thought those were still crimes
We need to clean up the deep corruption in our legislative system before any real reform can be made. I hope states will still be solvent
Please fight for us!!

California contributes the most but loses the most?

Tell me please how Obamacare has done for Oregon? ?
OR uninsured rate went from 17% to 5%, OR economy added 23k health care jobs; 95k received tax credits; better coverage = fewer ER visits.
Um, please do your research. That's not true. This is fuzzy math..

"Four states get 40 percent of the money under Obamacare: New York, California, Massachusetts and Maryland,"
Good
This is heartbreaking. Call all your senators, folks. Kill this bill!
Hmmmmm & every state (except VA) getting increases are Red States.

Did you really think it wasn't going to have cost associated with it???
It's so wrong.
They have been getting more than their fair share, and squandering it on non-working websites. Poster child for wasted tax $.
#DEPORT illegal aliens NOW & save billions for HC. Nat'l Debt doubled under Obama, cant leave debt to our children. Irresponsible!
Obama’s debt: Financial crash fix, Detroit fix, Stimulus bill, inherited wars, inherited Bush tax cuts. Get a brain and stop scapegoating
Already has been for my husband and myself.
Because republicans wrote the bill and they don't like your State. Wth?
FAKE NEWS
Please get lots of sleep this weekend! We need you next week for 3 day marathon to delay the vote
Maybe making abortions MANDATORY for insurers to pay for, even for illegals, isn't the best financial plan one watt
Maybe it is. Pro-life isn’t what the REPs are, they’re pro-birth. Just because they’re born doesn’t mean they’ll get health coverage.
Under the Democrats.Wyden, MERKLEY, Brown etc ETC Move them ALL out
Shifts management to the states. It's up the @OregonGovBrown to work it out. This will be fun to watch an incompetent governor manage this
This sure will get a pile of freeloaders off the rolls. Big break for the working people.
Keep fighting, Senator!
And we know u will vote no.
@Oregonian Walden must vote no or he is not representing his constituency. If he votes yes, this is his last term.
So much for the opiod crisis
The blatant punishment of blue states should outrage even among the red states. #GrahamCassidyNO
Distribution is by population...others have received much less.
So disgusted with the @SenateGOP Just when I think it can’t get worse, they go even lower! #KillTheBill #HealthCareForAll
Disgraceful- punishing Oregon cause we successfully implemented the ACA as it was designed instead of sabotaging it like the red states did.
Did you forget how much was wasted by state gov. on failure of exchange and on thousands of ineligible recipients?
Guessing we’d still pay almost the same in federal income tax, though.
Thank you for siding with logic and kindness. We can do much better than #GrahamCassidy & Americans deserve better.
So basically if trump carried a state increase. If he lost the state decrease. They don't care about people, they care about politics
That is not how decided.. did you know that under ACA 4 states get 40% of all Medicaid funds now...Ca, NY,http://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/federalstate-share-of-spending/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D …
That is your job.
Yessir!
Why are you asking for our help?
He's promoting activism & educating his constituents, it took an uprising last time to kill the bill - that's what he's asking for.
The Blue states pay for the Red States. They should be on their own. Maybe a wake up call.
Stop them Senator Merkley!!!!!!!
An honest Senator!! Tell it sir.
