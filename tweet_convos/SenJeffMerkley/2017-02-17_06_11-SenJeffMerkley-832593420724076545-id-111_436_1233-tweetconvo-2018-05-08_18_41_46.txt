THANK YOU SENATOR MERKLEY !
- Hey! McConnel WTF?! How can you do this? We are watching. We remember. Young'uns everywhere-this is your EPA
Thank you. #GoJeffMerkley #ThankyouJeff
Thank you Senator for being a leading voice in doing what is right. Scary times we live in. Stay strong for Oregon and US
Thank you. The public has a right to know what is in those emails
Go get 'em!
THANK YOU for standing up for clean air and clean water.
Thanks for trying. This is making no sense. The #environment is counting on all of us, and is not partisan.
But McConnell was his usual %÷/*%/ self
McConnel is a disgrace. I hesitate to use language like this, but there is simply no other way to put it.
STAND STRONG
Thank you! Pruitt would be a disaster.
Go get 'em Sen Merkley.
THANK YOU SENATOR MERKLEY for fighting for Americans right to clean air and water!
.@SenJeffMerkley @SenateMajLdr Thank you! I strongly support delaying the vote. @RonWyden @SenSanders
- ROCK ON, Sen. Merkley! To force a vote now before the JUDGE ORDERED EMAIL RELEASE ... !?!?!?
yes.  Thank you!
Oh, now you care about emails. You're a partisan hack. All your obstructing is bad for America.
thank you
As a retired EPAer, I know how devastating Mr. Pruitt's appointment will be to the mission and morale. Bleak!
Thank you. Stop the bastards!
To force a vote for the head of the EPA, before the release of emails with energy companies, is cowardice
Wld rather have them revealed after confirmation so he can then resign. Shameful pattern emerging for noms.
please delay Pruitt vote.  Thank you!
You must be given time to review the emails.
Thank you!
Delay vote until information is reviewed.

-- One of your Portland, NWGSD constituents
delay the vote!!!!!
Get @VP while you're at it. He's hiding something We the People need to know
Oh, NOW y'all suddenly care about what's in somebody's emails.
Delay the vote!  We need to see the emails. Although Pruitt is already determined unqualified.
THANK YOU!!!!
please demand a full review of these emails before a vote occurs! Conflict of interest must be avoided!
Move on start doing some work. I wouldn't cash my paycheck if I were you You have produced nothing Sen/Oregon
thank you Sen Merkley...you are looking out for us and the nation
thank you for asking questions and delaying this vote for us all to have answers.
Thank you Sen Merkley for leading this fight to protect our air, water and, ultimately, our health.
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley, for modeling integrity, statesmanship, patriotism, in contrast to @SenateMajLdr @GOP @SenateGOP. #RejectPruitt


let's see what's on Weiner's laptop. Word is, it's the key to our entire corrupt system.
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley. @SenateMajLdr should be ashamed.
I fully support you Senator Merkley. McConnell's objection is deplorable. I'm from OK. Pruitt is dangerous.
Thank you from an #oregon voter proud to have you as our senator!
THANK YOU!!!
Thank you! Please keep pushing. We can't let Pruitt lead the EPA.
theres no planet b! #StopPruitt
ooo, demanding  oooooooo, your embarrassing our state.
Well, we know what the GOP will do today, no worries. His resignation next week will be a bigger!  Keep fighting! Go Ducks!
yes, see the emails first! EPA should protect health and environment, not #BigOil money.
Party politics as usual. Have a good time trying to look good.
Merkley you pull anything to obstruct and drag out.... go back to Obama and leave the adults to their work.
DELAY!!!  It's easier to delay until info is released than to undo a big mistake!
thank you!
You give 'em hell, Senator Merkley. You're making Oregon proud.
Go Jeff Go 
Stand your ground Dems! Delay Vote! Let's see the emails first! @SenateDems

Good luck!!  Delaying the vote is entirely reasonable, it seems simple and something the GOP should agree to.
Emails. Damn emails. Frankly, I am NOT tired of hearing about emails.
thank you Senator Merkley! But if Senate confirms Pruitt, maybe emails will force him out faster than Flynn.
Thank you, Senator, for standing on the right side of history and protecting our shared planet.
Please and thank you!!!!
thank you for doing your job. Keep or up.
Keep the pressure on and thank you!
They must delay! Good Sen Marjory, and thank you!
YESSSSSS Make that Russiagate coverupper do the right thing!
don't worry, the emails are probably just about yoga and weddings.
seriously, thank you for fighting! U've been one of the strongest on the Senate floor throughout this process.
Thank you!! Pruitt is not a good selection - AT ALL!!!
@SenateMajLdr  - listen and delay
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Stressed out voter.
thank you for standing up to @SenateMajLdr !! He is a snake!
Thank you, Senator Merkley.
Thank you. You're a good man. Look for the email I sent this morning re: immigration. @SenateMajLdr
How about you delay yourself and go get a real job. Like owning slaves
