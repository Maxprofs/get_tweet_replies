"McConnell, for his part, explained that the decorum rule did not have an exception for factual information." !!??!!??
The Thumper Rule
I understand the need to limit ad hominem, but how do you argue against confirmation without listing disqualfications?
in legal cases, it's ncalled (character witness)and stands in court. In this case, it's nominee for ATTY GEN!:)
bravo #stoptheRepublicans#resist
Seems like @SenWarren should have legal avenue for gender discrimination at least against the Dinosaur
And did anyone try to silence him?
Shouldn't @SenWarren be"ungaveled"since the material she was censored for was later allowed?
you would think...yet
@SenateMajLdr OWES @SenWarren and EVERYONE AN EXPLANATION! THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS!
@harper I am so over trying to be respectfully civil to hypocritical thugs.
Great, but how'd he get away with it?
Pure speculation but I imagine McConnell realized he fucked up with Warren. @AaronMesh @wweek @SenJeffMerkley @coreypein
what gave him that idea?
Good for him. But I noticed he wasn't stopped or banned from the rest of the debate.
He's a man. There are different rules for men...
THANK YOU JEFF MERKLEY!
gag the woman/allow a man to deliver the same exact words....hmm, gross! but thankful msg was heard.
Thank you!
someone with a backbone!!
This comes under the equally ancient and arcane rule of the #SenateRepublicans known as mansplaining
When you censure Correta Scott King's message on Black History month you are a racist.
Yaaaass
TY, Coretta must not be silenced. WE THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE SILENCED
when was the letter written and for what purpose?
30 years ago to speak against a different appointment for Sessions.
Sen. Merkley is showing us proof of GOP misogyny. Thanks~!
Way to go Senator Merkley!  Thank you very much.
Silence one..ten take her place. silence ten..100 rise up.
awesome! All the Dems should do it.
I am proud to have Mr. Merkley as my senator.
she had it coming. Impugning has consequences. She knew that, she took a chance. Calculated
Is there no video link to this?  Neither WW or Oregonlive linked an actual video.

Thanks!
Thank you, Senator
thank you for having courage! We NEED the truth!
thank you to all Senators that stood for their colleague.
and Intel sends $7 billion and 10,000 jobs to AZ...he should have been working for Oregon
Thank You Mr. Merkley!
fine but a man was allowed to do this? Wtf?

YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!
Indivisible!
That's the way to do it! Thank you! All the way from the Netherlands!
notable here that he didn't get silenced like Warren.
YES...MY MAN
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley Oregon is proud of your courage!
Proud of you Sen Jeff Merkley! I voted for you! Good job upholding rights & speaking truth #GodSaveUSA
@coreypeinEvery Dem. should read teh letter asap @SenGillibrand be brave. @SenSchumer
Thank you Senator Merkley
That's how to get around madness! Great job!
bravo !
#class
so learn laws, rules and policy's before crying about something!!!!
policy and she was warned, and still broke the rules so that's why she was silenced!!!!!
out of the letter, a senator cannot stand on senate floor and degregate a fellow senator it's against
you people are stupid!!! It wasn't about reading the letter it was what she said about sessions----
AWESOME THANK YOU SENATOR
Seeing reports of several Dem Senators are reading Corretta Scott King's letter. Each in its entirety?
not surprised, I think they pulled an all-nighter.
That's right Dems, FIGHT. WE NEED YOU
DEFY & RESIST!!! #Resistance
glad this got read, but so sad that a woman was shushed for reading it and a man was not.
so proud to be an Oregonian right now! Sen Merkley has been at the forefront of the Trump resistance!
Isn't is funny how @SenJeffMerkley wasn't #silenced by @SenateMajLdr? #Hypocrisy? #Misogyny? @maddow @FoxNewsSunday
Thank you Senator Merkley for bringing Mrs. King's words to the Senate and for showing #WhyWeMarch
Thank you
Thank god @SenJeffMerkley has a penis. Otherwise @SenateMajLdr would have silenced him. #resist #persist @AaronMesh @coreypein
McConnel knows he can do as he wishes & KY will continue to re-elect him..he hates Warren is why he stopped her
How come he was able to read it, but Warren wasn't??  Because she has a vagina?
I believe each of the DEMS should read the letter one right after the other!!
thank you!
thanks Senator Merkley I live in AL & Sessions should NOT BE CONFIRMED I wish I could vote four you
profile in courage !!! JFK! Speak the truth!
thank you sir!
That's twice.
the hero we need right now
Amen let the people have a voice in the Senate.
Thank you, Senator!  The words needed to be said.
thank you Sen Merkley for reading Mrs. King's letter! Shame on McConnel for silencing Sen Warren!
Thank you Senator Merkley!
proud of my senator! #resist
I want Mr. Jeff Sessions
I want Sen Sessions tooI. On the fastest jet out of town!!
Bravo!
#we will not be silenced! @.@realDonaldTrump @POTUS #flotusmelania 
@FLOTUS
Thank you Senator.
Thank you for standing up for justice and freedom of speech #letlizspeak
So proud that he's my Senator.
such an embarrassment to the state of Oregon. People are tired of leadership picking laws to follow
Thank you for reading it! @AaronMesh @coreypein
thank you for standing up for what is right. We must not be silenced
Thank you Senator Merkley for using your male privilege to read one of our historical leader's letter.
I agree that's disturbing to me as a woman
Thank you for reading Kings letter. It's chilling that @SenWarren was silenced by Republicans.
OBSTRUCT! OBSTRUCT!
Once again I thank you, sir, for your courage!
thank you Senator Merkley.
A man reads it and McConnell says nothing. Bully.
He's a mysgonist. He's too scared to stand up for what's right but can bully a woman.
thank you for ensuring Mrs King's and Ms Warren's voices were heard.
woah ! Look at that some in the GOP actually has integrity
they blocked Eliz Warren from reading it.
 King would be very proud.
I am unable to locate any corroborating evidence that this happened except for from OregonLive weird

@CREDOMobile @SenJeffMerkley @coreypein Is this the one McConnell wouldn't let Warren finish?
yep, several people asked, and I added a line to the story to that effect.
THANK YOU Sen Merkely. it's Black History Month. LET. JEFF. SESSIONS' HISTORY. BE. KNOWN.
