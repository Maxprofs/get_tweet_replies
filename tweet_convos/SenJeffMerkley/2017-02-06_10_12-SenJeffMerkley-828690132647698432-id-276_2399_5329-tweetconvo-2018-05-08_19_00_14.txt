how did that work out for you? #dismissed
put them ALL in the Luny bin n let America get on w life
Do something more...one more Republican is all you need to do a great thing for "our children"
thank you!

devos demoralized
#NoonDeVos proves big contributions to campaigns are all that's needed to buy a Cabinet seat. Qualifications don't count.
the best thing we could do for this education is do away with unions, they just funnel $$$ to liberal dems. No accountability.
I'm a teacher and proud parent of two special needs boys. DeVos can't be let anywhere near children like mine. Vote NO on #DeVos
You realize Trump has an obsession with votes, right? Why do you think he had Russia help?
You're a teacher?  That is terrifying.  You're a parrot not a critical thinker.  I can tell.
You can't tell. I research facts for a living and have seen how facts elude Trump supporters. 
your not protecting kids well being by forcing them to stay in failing schools
When you repute everything Trump does, people stop listening. Good reason to be reasonable and pick your battles. Advice 4 Dems
Like Republicans did in 2009. Right. Gotcha.
Jones I don't remember protests, riots, Hollywood lectures, fight on EVERY issue, or Not My President in 2009?
thank you
too bad you weren't listening when we said no to Hillary and yes to Bernie. You are the reason we are stuck in this nightmare
sad day!
to late she's in 
Thank you for standing with all of us on this critical issue!!!
no your not cause all the parents I talk to at my kids school think you teachers are the problem and I live in Massachusetts.
Rock on boys and girls. You Dems are just digging yourself in deeper and deeper. I see a super majority in 2018.
@datagoodies Find it hard to believe you can't make a deal with just one more GOP voter. Sad to know Cab pos can be bought.
now is the time to discuss fixing #SchoolToPrisonPipeline all Senators not just #CoryBooker should be speaking on it #Resist
Oh, now Democrats care about education? Please. The system SUCKS. It sucked when I was in school. It sucks now.
No to #DeVosvote
@SenateGOP thinks this vote is a layup for them. They have no idea how angry America is. They will, but too late for our kids.
Are Pro Teacher Union   Don't care about Poor Students
@stephenbranham1 God help us all of Republican doesn't stand up for Education today
public schools don't teach anything but indoctrination into liberalism

She must be qualified to execute politics, not to a profession ! Naives !

Don't give in on this vote, the future is in your hands!

thank you for listening.  No on Betsy DeVos.  Unqualified !
thank you for speaking for 24 hours to rally against the confirmation of #DeVos. Vote NO-Kids deserve better. #nonpartisanissue
You know, if your previous leader Reid hadn't changed the senate rules, this nomination would fail. You should blame urselves.
Thank you for your efforts tonight. I hope your resolve will create the momentum we need to retake Congress in two years.

Former literature professor here & daughter of teachers: #devos is NOT qualified for this position!  #noDevos
@SenJeffMerkley no that is the point you are not listening because we have the 48 worst grad rate in the nation
@NatureGuy101 THANK YOU For UR NO VOTE ON DEVOS I am #TheResistance
Incompetent and unqualified for the job! #StopDeVos #SpecialEducation
THANK YOU
Devos unqualified to run a 4-child daycare.
@CarmelJudeobsc1 bout time the dems crawled out of their frightened little rabbit hole.
@SenJeffMerkley Better yet let's eliminate the department of ed. Let the state and local run education with out federal strings
I emailed Todd Young to urge him to vote against DeVos. DeVos gave him $37K in campaign contributions #moneyoutofpolitics
I wish this video is accessible to all including Deaf because this does not have captions.  We Deaf do vote too.
thanks for your continued fight to stop #SecretaryOfEducation pick #DeVos We must not allow this travesty U.S. future at stake.
Keep it up.
Thank you for protecting our public school system.--A former public school kid

stand strong! We are counting on you!
please elaborate. Getting real tired of this purely red vs. blue gang war.
y even consider her?!! She's not qualified!!'
Thank you Senators for doing the right thing: NOT voting for #DeVos. I urge you to #HoldTheFloor for #Sessions & #Gorsuch too.
Your all hypocrites. You all exercise choice by sending your kids to private schools. The poor can't. There is no greater crime!
no your listening to the teacher unions! try listening to the poor in our cities stick in failing public schools.
All Devos wants is to sell the children to the highest guest bidder.
Vote NO on DeVos because this is just one of many bad choices Trump has made since our country sadly elected him
Thank you for keeping up this fight!
keep fighting - our kids are at stake!
@ManMet80
thank you for fighting for our kids!!
@NEAToday STAND STRONG FOR US
Cory you are Just Listening to Functional Illiterates. Get over it pal, your party and career are destroyed.
@NEAToday I'm a parent and a teacher. Don't stop at hour 24. Shut it down until she's out #DeVosvote
it wouldn't matter who they nominated you'd be sour grapes.
the problem is that you democrats do NOT listen to the people.  You just do anything you want. LISTEN DEMOCRATS
keep it up. #DeVos is a pay-to-play know-nothing idealogue.
We are SO PROUD of you for doing what's right!!
Why do ALL (-2) elected Republicans care more about the unborn than about educating actual, real children??
you are obviously not listing to majority of all people
senator menendez tell it like it is on Devoz
@NEAToday Keep fighting for our kids! #VoteNoDevos
Thank you for listening to your constituents!
keep holding the floor! We're all so proud of you!!
Every single one of you needs to vote NO! Let the GOP fail by their own hand.
We dont want DeVos!
She's as qualified as any big donor to a political party! Get over this and move on.
@SenJeffMerkley Thank you from South Carolina!
DO MORE THAN LISTEN, VOTE NO AND ASK  YOUR REPUBLICAN BUDDIES TO VOTE THEIR CONSCIOUS NOT THEIR PARTY. THEN GO AFTER SESSIONS
My daughter will go as far as homeschooling her daughter if that horrible woman gets control of the education system!
As a public school teacher, I'm asking you not to approve Betsy DeVos for SOE.  Not right for the job.
Thanks for the valid attempt. For the lack of one spineless republican
why don't we have a leader who can reason with the Republican Senate?  What is wrong with that amoral group.
don't vote on her at all, until she withdraws, same with sessions..  #impeachTrumpnow
Thank you, from a Special Education teacher!
No your not listening
Keep up the fight to #DumpDevos
We're with you all the way @DeVos was given a fair pubic hearing and in that hearing she demonstrated that she is not qualified
...more than likely individuals educated via Common Core who are illiterate...
I'm a sub HS teacher; a parent; END Common Core; & zip codes should not limit where students attend school.  Vote for DeVos
, THANK YOU! Our Republican representatives have made it clear they do not care what we think (Um, Burr)
I said to vote yes
that's because your afraid of charter schools that do perform better than Public schools.what did Obama's sec of ED.do4schools 
@SenBookerOffice thank you
This blinding, hysterical partisanship is astounding.
And you ma'am have just proven that you are in the back pocket of the teachers union. #Shame on you ma'am...
We've listened to them for decades & here we are, steeped in failure.We need someone UNTOUCHABLE, smart &OUTSIDE the box. Devos!
I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 could do commentary on the Senate Republicans while they make their case for DeVos
the future of America is the education of our children. How anyone could even consider DeVos for this job is beyond me! Bad 45!
that is why? it is called draining the swamp.ever one of his cabinet members are the same,not qualified. look  what he has done.
#i support you
.@SenateDems @cyw07 Numbers to call and fax here:

devos wants educational freedom not communist indoctrination
Thank you for your NO vote!! 
as a parent of 2, please know that I appreciate the no votes on this
#VoteNoDevos thank you!
Teachers Unions have destroyed the quality of education in this country! Btw Common core sucks!
apart under "educators" like her. It's been a disaster. We have lost amazing teachers, and our children are paying. Vote No!
I am the mother of 9 children, a former teacher, raised by a teacher. She is not qualifed. I have watched DCSD in CO fall 1/2
THANK YOU!!!!!
stop the lying  liberal left. We need God back in our schools. These children need to learn how to learn and think. Not protest
DEVOS IS A TOOL TO HELP DESTROY R PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
When wealth control education the poor always lose bigly. 
#devos
VOTE YES ON DEVOS
@SenJeffMerkley the reason for dem bad behavior they dont want competition with communist indoctrination of children
Demand that Senators who received contributions from DeVos abstain from voting!  It is unethical. Talk about "pay to play"!
Thank you! 
we know that, but what are you doing about convincing the Republicans that's the problem
you have heard us and thank you. DeVos is not qualified for office. Ask any parent/teacher in Michigan. #noDevos
I don't have kids or grandkids in school right now, but I can see DeVos as being bad for education.
@SenJeffMerkley Horrible pick. What about unpaid fines in MI?
@SenJeffMerkley PLEASE REPUBLICANS VOTE NO! DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN? OUR FUTURE?
Dems speaking in the next 24 hrs should end w/ unified msg: She plagiarized her answers. Cheaters should not be in charge of edu
thank you and keep it up!!
Unqualified or just doesn't fit into your little box?
DeVoss donates big bucks to politicians for her & her family's agendas. Not qualified either. Another elitist thinks she's above
@KamalaHarris Please listen to the people! VOTE NO ON #devos Our children R our Future! Protect them!
@SenJeffMerkley Stay strong, VOTE NO to Devos! Unqualified, and will damage our education system for years to come! #DeVosvote
Looks like an anit-woman campaign to me.  Looks like dems have a problem with women being in charge of education.
vote no on all of them....get a clue, we don't want any of those #resist
@SenJeffMerkley 
sad but true money  talks & you scratch my back I'll scratch yours is the only thing that works in Washington DC for both party
I applaud your efforts we all know she'll get in. We all know @BetsyDeVos has padded the pockets of many republican
@SenJeffMerkley she is greatly qualified to be sec of Ed.
Your "teachers, students, and parents" you fictionally consulted, came through your corrupt brainwashing system. There's that.
keep her out! Vote no for this unqualified woman!
Thankyou! #devos is a total disaster waiting to happen, the worst possible choice for education. #DumpDevos
no you're not...you're listening to UNIONS.
Come on!!! You NEVER listen to the voters!
#noDevos #RejectDeVos
you are wrong! We support @BetsyDeVos
you have to much money to loose for the teachers union that is why the Dems. are doing
Finally, something I agree with you on. NO.
thank you!! Stay strong and say NO to the billionaire takeover.
keep it up Dems!
We need a Secretary of Education that will #standup4publiceducation
with you! @SenBobCasey thank you! A constituent from PA.
