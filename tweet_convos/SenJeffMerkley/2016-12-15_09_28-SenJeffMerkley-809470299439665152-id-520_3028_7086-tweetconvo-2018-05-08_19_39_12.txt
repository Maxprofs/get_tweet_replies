@cblazina @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley  Didn't HRC accept gifts from foreign govts as SOS?
No, she didn't. #FakeNews
Riiiiiiiigggghhhhtttt
Wrong. Try accessing unbiased  sources. #FakeNews
I didn't say she broke the law. I said she accepted gifts. She did.
Donations to a charity do not=gifts to an individual. And, if there were gifts, that would be illegal. Period.
Just be aware that the precedent u seem comfortable with can - and will- be used by DT. No problem with HRC, then no problem w DT
<- But a problem with me pointing out the double standard apparently bc I'm blocked 
Isn't explicitly stated w/in Constitution enough already to impeach?
Because that clause of Constitution excludes presidents.
emoluments clause covers all govt officials.
That belief is debatable and current understanding disagrees
u said president is excluded. That's trump team talk only
I accept your apology in lieu of your silence or six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon explanation.
I will stand by the line in the constitution vs muddy blog article. U think he should have free reign for anything?
Is that hyperbole? Why would you think Trump will do "anything"?
.@SenWarren I am w/you. Please do whatever you must to stop @realDonaldTrump & @SpeakerRyan. They do NOT stand for #America's best. #MAGA
Your Alinsky tactics are backfiring. The Party of ID politics has now become Party of Racial Divide in this country!
.@tb0811 @SenWarren America has NEVER overcome its racial divide. This country was built (and continues to be) on slavery. #BlackLivesMatter
You aim to keep it that way with your ideology. I have no hope for your awareness to improve!
.@tb0811 @SenWarren There's no ideology; I love my country and, yet, am not afraid to deal w/our past. #HUAC #FirstNations #BlackLIvesMatter
You contribute to racial divide as a means to keep party in power. You are a party of lawlessness and sewer values!
.@tb0811 @SenWarren How can we be for "big, meddling government" AND lawlessness? If #compassion is a "sewer value" I'll happily be a #TMNT.
NO hope for you. Your awareness is brainwashed. Compassion for a bunch of liberal elites run by special interests?
1/2 cannot accept Trump defending PUTIN on hacking--IMPEACH TRUMP
I cannot accept Trump accept protecting PUTIN he is a fool
Let's git'r dun!!!
Wait, what? It's in the Constitution Why, a bill? @SenWarren @JABaloney @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley
@SenStabenow @SenBookerOffice are you in with Senator Warren too?
Why is that necessary?
Can you introduce a bill to require tax returns for presidential candidates?
Can you look at the 14th Amendment, Sec 3 first? No Elector can aid the enemy,
***NOW*** is the time to use SECTION 3 of the 14th Amendment. Expressly for the purpose of removing Trump.  No Elector can vote for him. 
The sad part is that we have laws in place to stop this monster from taking office but they are scared of him!
or they are watching their stock portfolios grow and wondering why they should do anything.
there's a reason the stock portfolios are growing; "a majority of Americans are optimistic."
Please let us know the BILL NUMBER so we can call.
Good news! Proud of this group, @SenJeffMerkley in particular. Way to represent OR!!
It’s already the law of the land. Whydo u need a bill 2 implement it?Stop wasting time and our money!
@marierutkoski @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Yes! No one is above the law!
Introduce all the bills you want.
Thank you! We are deeply worried about Trump's conflicts of interest.

clearly brianknowsnothing
Thanks for the Nuclear Option @SenatorReid 
thank you.  He has to choose:  businesses or Presidency.  Easy.  How much more money does he need?  He's out of control..again

@amjoyshow @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons Finally elected official w/guts & not some1 that sold their soul to hell and Trump
Please do not EVER back down.
it's gonna take you awhile, but eventually you'll realize you've been conned.
@HiMaui @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Thank you. What's happening to our country is disgraceful.
THIS INTERVIEW CLEARLY SHOWS TRUMP ADMITTING TO HAVING A 'CONVERSATIONAL' RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN!
Watch Trump directly say he has a relationship w Putin. Roger Stone tweeted re: Podesta emails before leak. Wake up! 
So telling someone what to do with their business is OK with you?
Is the POTUS not a servant to the people?
LMAO...It will never reach the floor Pocahontas!!! #MAJORITY>#minority
Do you want to spell America, Америка?
REPUBLICAN!!! LMAO #MAGA
Isn't the next step Impeachment?
why January don't you think it should be stopped before he is in office
@Moo57556470 Yes!!!@SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley
Pls, before the Trump criminal family bleeds America dry
@Mooncatadams @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley & Electoral College. Relic of White Male colonial rule
. Trump today: "No laws saying I can't continue to be involved with my businesses."
Trump's the most corrupt President-elect in the history of our nation
Great, but the Republicans will vote it down. Someone needs to sue him
We need a leader who will stand up to the despot who will soon occupy the White House. Be the one.
Thank you for protecting our country! #emoluments #conflictofinterest
Now fight for us. Before this lunatic elect destroys our democracy.
That was a hell of lot to fight against. But the majority still spoke.
Voter suppression, WikiLeaks, Comey, Putin, MSM, electoral stopped us.
The MAJORITY voted Hillary.
WE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE CORRUPTION TRUMP EXPLOITS DAILY.
Is this TRUE!?!? DT posse browbeats Hill GOP http://pllqt.it/MUUpkT 
Could've endorsed Bernie and avoided this #NoSpine
@dannychun @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley 
YES
The Demorat Communist party is at it again
@Alba_Dawn @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Do you see it as more than just a symbolic effort?
GOP will only act if they can't evade public pressure.
Public pressure isn't enough.That requires caring about public http://opinion.Legal  action is required
But it doesn't seem the courts will do anything they're not forced to.  As Newt said, once prez, DT can do whatever he wants.
Courts generally rule on cases brought before them. They don't take the initiative.
Please Please Please do!  A million times Please!!!!
Hallelujah!
@Stop_the_Morons @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Thank you! Truth matters! #TrumpLeaks

Thank you for Standing up to Trump! He is Not a Patriot ! #TrumpSwamp
Thank you, Senators. He must be held accountable and we cannot normalize any of this.
Ok, so the recount was about Trump, and now this... sour grapes maybe?
Thank you
Charge bankers for running scams You saw it. They don't care, who does?

From the bottom of my broken heart THANK U
I am positively giddy with anticipation. Senator Warren, et al-rock on!
HURRY!!!
Thank goodness someone is doing SOMETHING! I feel #powerless #hopeless
If it weren't for people like you I'd emigrate now. HELP, SEN Warren!
@GOP @FoxNews where is bill to stop Obama's abusing tax $ on vacations?
we need our leadership to keep country safe hold trumps feet to fire
Right on Elizabeth Warren, forcing Trump to divestiture is the only way
National popular vote of people not geography
whatever Fauxcahontis.
Great -- but will it apply to the new president? @AdamParkhomenko
.@SenWarren It's already in the original Constitution. You don't need another one. You have grounds to impeach DJT on Day 1
yall are mad cause yall lost and cant control the people! yall corrupted. Hillary for prison
With few exceptions Dem pols R not doing anything to stop Trump.
can you say sour grapes Democrats??  Democrat 50 years. Embarrassed!!
Why not this week?
Thank you Serious questions, Who will enforce? What is the penalty?
Sen. Feinstein's team is collaborating with strong focus on enforcement. @brontyman @SenWarren @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin
Thank you very much I do not have faith that Congress, or the Justice department will act He so far has been above the law
Shouldn't that Clause already be in effect?
THANK YOU
what??? She did take donations. You democrats...get on my nerves
WHO MADE YOU GOD ANYWAY? I have a right and my vote matters!!!
Why are elected people like you trying to disenfranchise my vote?
You Liberals are evil people, you ignored us and we made a change.
Thanks for not respecting my vote for Trump. Am I not in a democracy?
You've not learned why the Dems lost, keep up this stupid nonsense. Ok?
tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
Why didn't u include yourselves and rest of the Senate under this bill?
make sure everyone has to abide by this law
agree
This has to be done and all levels, With Trump, he is greedy bastard
Go Madam go! @SenWarren @Ellesun @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley #DrainTrumpSwamp @realDonaldTrump #CorruptTrump
Thanks for playing...
allof you so called Senators, list your before and after accounts
stop being the problem and start being the solution
Hey Liz, how about you do a great service to your country and take an overdose of narcotics. That would be swell.
iimpeach and prison please with a dash of treason
Article I, Section 9; No bill of attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.
I recommend you look at the ex post facto and bills of attainder clause
In my opinion, silly and showing how foolish they are, in my opinion.
Do you believe a Republican led Congress will enforce the Constitution?
Why introduce emoluments bill which will fail? Violation of Constitution = impeachment. No question.
TY 4 doing something Feeling defenseless Terrifiying test to Democracy
Thank you for standing up for the people.

@co_rapunzel4 @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Looking to day you bring articles of impeachment v djt.

@marierutkoski @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley But take a page from GOP book: don't show your hand!
@kristinrawls @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley good luck Senator.
Wow 2.8  votes and the cheater will  be the next president.

Go girl!!
Please draft bill: Pres-elects must prove divest conflicts of interest
Please draft bill mandating all presidential nominees must show taxes
it already is the law, have to impeach if not divested
isn't it frightening that we have to pass a new law just to enforce existing constitutional law?
they all must support you. It is critical.
I will support you!
DO NOT ALLOW DJT TO BULLY AMERICANS INTO LETTING HIM KEEP HIS ASSETS
thank you.  Someone needs to stand up for us.
Its time to call a spade a spade-DT by suggesting Russia hack USA
Why do we need a bill to implement an already existing clause?
Convenient. Now that Hillary has lost.
HYPOCRITES!
Clinton Foundation?   Hypocrites.
Before he is sworn in, I hope
PLEASE help keep our country from collapsing under DT & cabinet SCARED
Can you gather enough votes to pass this over a presumed DJT veto?
Thank you!

Conflicts of interest is throughout Washington. Which one first? Trump!

Go away all of u,We do not expect Trump to lose money to be president
His POTUS annual salary is 400k! Is that not enough?
.@SenWarren @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Why didnt you do that with Clinton. How about when she was SOS?
Let's pass a law for it to be against the law to claim to be a Fauxcohontas
Yes. Yes. Yes.
@Nancynotsosharp @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley Dems hold @realDonaldTrump words and actions to fire!
Have you cleared this with Hillary yet?  She may need you to concentrate on finding more people to blame. Priorities, right?
YES, let's not try to make what Trump is doing to be normal Practice, It's NOT Enforce the Law...Be our Law and Order Voice...TY
Great job! Keep going! Stop DT! What can citizens do to help?
if you think enough Republicans will join you're delusional.
You need to STOP HR Bill 4919! https://youtu.be/8RzlXfYBVW8  #tuckercarlson

@SamWangPhD @SenatorCardin @ChrisCoons @SenatorDurbin @SenJeffMerkley 
better for people to concentrate on #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
You are no better than a gangster racketeer.
plz add that litigation involving tRumps must settle on #peoplescourt
A Third-World coupe. Your pocket is more important than this country
Sabotaging the will of the American voter? How low can you be? Inmoral
Excellent.
Where can we read about this bill?  On your website? Please tweet link!
