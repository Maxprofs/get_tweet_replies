Excellent Civics lesson for all!

Oregonians are so proud of their Senators. Well done Senator Merkley for standing up (for 15 hrs) for all Americans with a #NoGorsuch vote!
We'll remember.
@SenJeffMerkley Thank You!!
But why was @SenJeffMerkley alone? Why won't ALL Democrats boycott the Senate & REFUSE to participate until Mr. Garland gets a hearing?
The Senate doesn't work that way
Given what's at stake, I don't think polite, business-as-usual procedural moves are going to cut it anymore. Dems need to get creative.
You don't thing resisting everything is a good strategy?
Dems should engage in procedural resistance PLUS new strategies. For instance, rally voters/activists to protest GOP reps directly.
GOP reps shouldn't be able to go anywhere w/o protestors in their faces, dogging them wherever they go, including their HOMES & offices.
Thank you for your strength and for standing up for the majority of Americans!!
Wish he worked that hard for our state.  48 of 50 in education.  Increasing homelessness, etc...  repeal and replace @SenJeffMerkley ASAP.
huh. seems like it helped
Silly
Thank you so very much @SenJeffMerkley
Thank you Senator!  Awesome, Awesome job!!!

Who gets to tell Merkley that the real filibuster is on Thursday?

Boy, I hope they kept him well hydrated. Thank you @SenJeffMerkley for informing those who need it and standing up for us all.
