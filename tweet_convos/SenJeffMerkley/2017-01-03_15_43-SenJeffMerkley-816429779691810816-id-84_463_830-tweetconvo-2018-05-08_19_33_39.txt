Apparently you're not familiar with the #ElectoralCollege 
Missed that day in grade school?
The electoral college wasn't meant to supplant and override the people's VOTE.
no it's  meant to prevent two states out of 50 from controlling who wins.  NY and CA
You do realize that the electoral college was established before state, right? When the US was tiny?
you do realize this has happened four times in the history of the US, right?  Ur upset that your girl lost
it's not like it's an every day occurrence.  It might be obsolete, but it's OUR rules.  Deal with it.
And as a Trump supporter, you'd probably also like to return to the days when "the rules" accepted slavery.
and you wonder why you lost. People are tired of people like you.  Trump will be in for 8 years if you maniacs keep bitching
Please PREACH...#THUGLICONS THEY HAVE NO MANDATE HELL TO DA  NO!!!!
Only 27.2% of eligible voters voted for @realDonaldTrump.
okay? Your point? He still won by the rules both sides played with. Its Hillarys fault she blew it
What do you THINK the point is?  Obviously, solidifying @SenJeffMerkley's "no mandate" statement re: @realDonaldTrump.
it doesn't mater because technically every elected president has a mandate.
He can mandate his butt! Why do you and others fail to see he's mentally ill
why do you and others fail to see he is the President? I'd argue that's the real mental illness.
question...What is he going to do for you? Build a wall and make the rich, richer and the middle class poorer?
it doesnt matter what he is going to do, the fact that you still dont seem him as the president is an issue you need to check out
THANK YOU SENATOR MERKLEY! No Mandate, NO right to erode democracy!!!
He won! Move on!
Trump is not a legitimate president; why is the election being validated.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley  @realDonaldTrump
Wait, you can't claim all those people "voted against Trump."
Go back and look at what Sen Merkley stated.
and sadly 46% of the people did not vote.
The mandate is the Electoral College. Read a history book as to why it's important. That is, if you can read...
That's MY Senator! I love him. He has promptly answered my emailed concerns with real answers for years.
senator you will now learn to regret filibuster reform...

Obamacare's history!
Is he not in violation of logan law I believe it is called for backing putin over his country & americans
Sen Merkley Thanks for the reminder.
Sir, remember the Rule of Law.  Whether we like outcome or not.  WORK TOGETHER, compromise is your job
U need to block every motion the Reps. Want to do like they did to Barack.  Fight with only way u can win
I've learned that Nice gets u nowhere when u are against A-- Holes u have to play dirty sometimes!
could you plz try to work together before you start bashing!
No, he doesn't have a mandate, but he has the House and Senate... and that's all he needs.
Senator -- Thanks for the reminder that Hillary far outpolled Trump. Let's abolish Electoral College.
Thank you for your leadership. It is a relief to hear lawmakers stating strong opposition to the GOP's harmful agenda.
Remember, your opinion & values does not count unless you with the majority. Don't be the ONE WAY POL.
If you don't want to be part of American resign. The USA is in serious trouble. DO YOU WANT TO HELP FIX IT?
The Electoral College worked. It's the little guy who won and don't let your ass forget that. Shape up.
Your right, but we DEPLORABLE'S are more important then them. We are the one's who kicked NY & CA. out.
Brilliant! President Obama had a clear mandate, yet McConnell & his gang obstructed him from day One.
lame @realDonaldTrump check this guy
Most VOTERS didn't vote for Trump*.
@NaphiSoc @realDonaldTrump Good way to start. Call it like it is! The truth is you don't have a mandate, Mr. Minority Pres.
only 8 of the counties in Oregon voted for Hillary.. and yet you seem to serve the only those 8 counties..
Do you even know the Constitution? We don't vote for a President. We vote for electors. He has as much a mandate as Obama.
Our gov has no mandate to govern....We have ZERO confidence....well at least I have zero...
Call him out at every turn.
@rosecitytransit @realDonaldTrump GO TRUMP!! #Trump2016
@rosecitytransit @realDonaldTrump and what is your point?? Trump won fair and square. This is why you should be impeached
Except for the largest Electoral College win since 1980. Stop trying to de-legitimize the new President!
he's illegitimate and will be treated as such
Good for you. I'm serious.
Thank you, sir for protecting all Americans and our country.
GREAT speech Senator! No Mandate!
God bless @SenJeffMerkley for being a reassuring voice of reason for America to hear, and for putting @realDonaldTrumpon on alert.
  Senator Merkley, I am proud that you represent me. Please stand with us in saying no to Sessions.
OBSTRUCT EVERYTHING! He has NO mandate. It's a Fraudulency. #resistrump
thank you for the reminder to our Americans.
@BellaLibelle @realDonaldTrump We damn sure didn't, and it's scary as hell hearing him try to bully other nations.
@nadinevdVelde  thank you Senator! Donald Trump must not be the President ever
BRAVO!!!
@jentaub @realDonaldTrump
Keep telling the truth, Senator!  Don't let anyone forget.
And we need to press the issues for which the 65 million plus voted. Put forth those things.
and this comes from some one who has ignored the needs of his constituents in Curry County.. shame on you..
KEEP REMINDING everyone in DC of this ! Please help us senator !
Proud of you, Sen. Merkley!
Thank you Senator Merkley for fighting for everyday citizens! We support all you and your compadres do!
Trumps got NOTHING - ZERO - NOT ONE DAMN THING! Get it right!!!
but he won and we're stuck with him
Thank you for fighting for Oregon Sen. Merkley
Shame on you for attempting to manipulate people with outlandish BS! He won the electoral college!
not even in office yet and already creating jobs and stimulating the economy
Keep up the fight, Senator Jeff. We have your back.
Thank you for standing up for us, Senator. You make me proud to have voted for you.
Article II section 1, Amendment XII, and even Amendment XX say you are wrong @SenJeffMerkley #USConstitution
either you are attempting to manipulate the politically illiterate or you are incompetent!
He did better than Bill Clinton's 43%.
actually according to the rules that every president was elected by he does have a mandate to lead.
That's what I've been saying.  UR job is 2 convince republicans now. Sorry, but somebody has to do it.  :)
education reform, electoral college reform. Please.
need to teach better critical thinking skills & improve access to college if we want ppl 2 stop voting GOP.
lol you realize that Trump received more college voters than Romney did.
you're proving my point, because even if that's true it doesn't negate what I've said.
no actually it does. It proves "college" doesn't make you vote democrat. Which you seem to think so
I didn't say that. It makes your chances of voting democrat more *likely.*
no you literally said we need to expand college access to get people to stop voting GOP
no, I would not make an obviously false claim. Seek more charitable interpretations.
blah,blah,blah keep wining Markley
fight the good fight Senator!
Reminder: Democrats are giving the US to a traitor without a fight.
Thank you!
Preach! 
.@SenJeffMerkley Thank you for speaking out!
