: hating on women in your spare time must make you a ton of fun at parties. 

@SenJeffMerkley @SenateGOP @SenWarren
and he blocked me.
That is great, a BIG MOUTH CAN GET YOU IN TROUBLE, She really needs to resign.
Thank you for standing up for Sen Warren and Coretta Scott King!

#lizspeak
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @SenWarren have you no shame SenateGOP? Wait,u put DeVos in, guess we know who u serve, yourselves

no worries 
@erasergal appreciates your efforts to fight for justice and integrity!
@nagast_amazin @SenateGOP @SenWarren

She can read it.

Just not in the Senate.
At best it's 3rd person hearsay.
At worse it's relevant 65 years ago.
Not now.
He lived in the South.
He was a prosecutor.

I would assume any Southern prosecutor
Do you think he harbors racist tendencies today that will interfere with his duties?
Censored to protect their own bigoted selves.
thank you for reading the letter
#wewillnotbeshushed
#HeForShe Thank you for standing up and thank you for supporting Senator Warren.
Embarrassed there are so many racists as elected Senators. Shameful.
Indeed.  They think we're all too stupid to notice.
You guys are our heroes. DON'T stop now. We are behind you 100%!!
Can we please have more Senators from both sides that can stand up for what is right and true
THANK YOU!  FACTS ARE NOT INSULTS!
:You Dems are obstructing the new POTUS that we the people voted for. You will lose even more next time
outrageous!!
I am also extremely proud you are my senator!
LOVE you guys.  So proud of our Oregon Senators!  KEEP FIGHTING.
#LetLizSpeak
Dems should lead effort to censure McConnell for this disgraceful action.
If you morons would read the rules instead of grandstanding on everything, u wdn't be told to shut up
@Redwingsdiva @SenateGOP @SenWarren Where was your outrage when Hillary was silenced and SCOTUS & election were stolen?
unbelievable..thank you @SenJeffMerkley..#Resist
@saaasbo @SenateGOP @SenWarren Warren/Merkley 2020 has a nice ring to it. 
Thank you Senator Warren! You did good!
Thank youJeff Merkley! I am so glad I voted for you!

A travesty censoring National Treasure @SenWarren representing #WeThePeople. #NotSuitableNotQualified
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
Um, if you were not censured, "why is this thing not like the others?" 
thank you for standing up against @SenateGOP & @SenateMajLdr. I am proud to have Honorable Merkley as my Senator!
thank you for fighting for us Sen Merkley!!!
Thank You Jeff!!,You've been making Oregon Proud, please keep it up!!
@tidallife @SenateGOP @SenWarren 
WRONG! She hadn't gotten to the CSKing ltr. She quoted radical left Ted Kennedy. More BS!
- he impugned himself with his own behaviors. Coretta put it into words that still apply today Vote NO
- You know the rules!  All you have to do is follow them!  Stop inciting violence!
Thank you for standing up for Warren.
Thank you for standing up to @SenateGOP, and doing Oregon proud.
#LetLizSoeak
Way to step up when they tried to shut her down. Haha...shows they fear her.
Unbelievable how low GOP Senate will go! SAD!!  Merkley & Warren on right side of history.
Liz i want to hear it!! Read it on twitter! I promise it will go viral and the male chauvinist  known
.@Hannajewel @SenJeffMerkley @SenateGOP @SenWarren she read it on Facebook live last night to 1.5 MILLION PPL @SenateGOP #ShePersisted
Way to go, Senators! #resist
#letlizspeak #ShePersists
merkley lying to his constituents.... again.  So ugly.  She broke the rules AND WAS WARNED
Sen Merkley, thank you for picking up where Sen Warren was so ridiculously censored.
thank you Senator Merkley.  This Oregonian is proud that you represent my state. #LetLizSpeak
T.Y. Jeff. Your the Man!
Don't pay attention to haters. Let all Dems read the letter and McConnell can shut them up in disgrace
thanks for getting Kings letter read!
@YeahNoRight @SenateGOP @SenWarren An absolute outrage.  So proud of her response.
Senate rule 19.  Rules even apply to fraudulent white women posing as native American.
We deplorables are a bunch of racist pigs. The race card is played out. Try again. How about women?
Please! tell me, the deplorable one, how I hate women and want grandma to die. Played out.
A good one.  Tell me how much I loathe gays and the LGBTQ community as a whole. Trump after Orlando.
not only racist, but sexist as well
she was censured for breaking Senate rules, you've just lied and should be as well. Why do Dems lie?
thank you for speaking up & reading CSK letter. Sessions should NOT be AG.
It was a smackdown perhaps related to the vote on Chao? I wonder.
Thank you Senator Merkley for standing up for your colleague in a moment of national shame. 
@SenJeffMerkley @SenateGOP @SenWarren
#shepersists
@rkfatheree @SenateGOP @SenWarren This happened last night within an hour of Sen.Warren being silenced. They read it aloud.
Why should a Senator follow the Senate Rules? She scammed Harvard's rules to get a $350K Gig! PHONY!
So proud to call you my Senator. Thank you, Jeff!
They censured @SenWarren speaking MLK widow's in #BlackHistory month. @SenateGOP is party of racists, misogynists. #resist
Thank you for your leadership! Do not grow weary.
Thank you Senator Merkley.  Hold a press conference and denounce the silencing of Warren.
THANK YOU, Sen. Merkley for reading what needed to be heard!
She deserved it.
it's a lie . it wasn't letter she was warned. she broke the rules. democrats r a fraud .
SEN BYRD KKK
Step up, stand up, speak out!  Thanks for doing the next right thing Senator. #LetLizSpeak
@Monte_Alto @SenateGOP @SenWarren oh I agree. Shut her the hell up. Who cares if King wrote it. It's not gospel
Sen. Warren was doing what Coretta Scott King was doing... attacking Jeff Sessions.
@Millennial_Dems @SenateGOP @SenWarren    You should have voted against DeVos.  No Pres for you in 2020.
@Millennial_Dems @SenateGOP @SenWarren thank you. KEEP FIGHTING! Proud of your persistence. #resist
thank u for continuing 2read mrs.king letter I am proud you represent me and my state We wont b silent
Thank You for reading the Coretta Scott King letter. I am impressed! and grateful!
Confused. I thought the Repubs *like* Sessions' racism. Isn’t that why President Bannon nominated him?
#RESIST!
Thank you for reading parts of the letter! #LetLizTalk
THANK  YOU!!! Modern Day Heroes!!!!! You both are amazing!!!!!!!!  
Thank you for reading Ms King's letter after Sen. Warren was stopped from doing so.
Should have sent her back to the reservation.
thank you
Thank you for reading the Coretta Scott King letter.
Then did you read it?
Thank you, both, Senators for persisting and making this important message be heard.
When do the GOP's tactics qualify as fascism? The answer is now, right now. #LetLizSpeak
and yet they allowed a man to speak...women have been here before #LetLizspeak #ShePersisted
@Redwingsdiva @SenateGOP @SenWarren Unbelievable!!!
This is shameful!  GOP doesnt rep all citizens just the right wing base & corrupt rich!
Understand you then read that letter. #props #together #waytogo #notjeffsessions
thank you, Sen., for rereading the letter. I'm upset that Warren was silenced because she's a woman.
Thank you, Sen. Merkley.
story out there that you were able 2 read letter on floor 2  applause while @SenWarren was dismissed-true?
@rolandsmartin @SenateGOP @SenWarren #midterms2018
Thank you for speaking up.
, so why didn't one of the other dem senators speak up and finish reading the letter?
Thank you for standing up for your colleague!
Appalling,Disrespectful,Unbelievable! I'm glad it was read yet it was ok if a man read it not a women?
thank you, senator, for backing sen warren and american people. mcconnell and GOP are "bad hombres".
shameful.  Thank you Sen Merkley for standing up. Thank you Sen Warren. I stand with you
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @SenWarren This is like a bad episode of House Of Cards with Dems party's grandstanding behavior.
I guess Dems don't have to follow any rules or laws
thank you Senator!
Old white man reprimands woman...and so it goes.
Thank u for picking up @SenWarren & CSKing's cause when @SenateGOP seemingly slipped back 60 yrs. Disgusting behavior GOP.
We need extreme vetting for those who would are trying to destroy  democracy.
Sadly, misogyny is alive and well in the Senate.
Thank you Senator Merkley.
So, wait, @SenWarren was censured for reading something that you were allowed to read?  How is that not sexist?
Thank you for reading it when she wasn't "allowed." The blatant sexism of @SenateGOP is appalling.
Interesting he didn't censure u for reading same letter! U did wht EVERY Dem shld have! #LoveMySenator

"#CheatersNvrWin/Tuche' Turtle's at it again,It's the GOPooper scoopers only way they know how to win!
What is this? McConnell gets paid for Devos vote THEN he won't allow debate of AG candidate
thank you for standing up for a cause. Important to bring people together, rather than separate
thought Dems  might take turns reading/ getting time out. Apparently McConnell was already over it.
good job Senator #mysenator #proud #letlizspeak
Thank You, Sen. Merkley, for proving:

THANK YOU for your patriotism!! 
LET LIZ SPEAK !
unbelievable
Did they censure you, 2, or is it just about quieting women? Thanks for carrying on the fight! #resist
@rkfatheree @SenateGOP @SenWarren And, to add insult to injury, this happened during Black History Month!
In four years they be blaming this mess somehow on the democrats.
YESSSS!!!! Thank you!!!! @SenateGOP should be ashamed of themselves. bigly.
Tthanks, @SenJeffMerkley, for finishing reading the letter. No matter who starts it, I'm glad to know you're there to finish! @SenateGOP
Thank you Senator Merkley! @SenateGOP
- Liar. That's not why she was censured. Tell the truth!  @SenateGOP @SenWarren
Thank you Senators Warren and Merkley! You did not impugn Sen. Jeff Sessions! Sen.Session's own record is self-impugning!
There's no sweeter sound than a Senate debate in which Little Miss $400k/class has to sit down & shut up .@SenJeffMerkley .@SenWarren
Thank you for reading the letter and standing up for free speech! #LETLIZSPEAK
Thank you for reading the letter! You're doing a great job!
Didn't you read the letter later uninterrupted? Why wasn't @SenWarren given the same respect? Thank you for all you do!
Plz run POTUS #Merkley2020! PLEASE JEFF! U are EXTREMELY popular & wanted by the people for POTUS!
that is not how democracy functions or real men behave. #letlizspeak
so proud of you Jeff!! And so proud that you represent my state!! Good job!!
Stuff the old fossil, McConnell, back into a broom closet and let @SenWarren READ IT! #LetLizSpeak
This Oregonian is proud that u took that letter & FINISHED it. But it's absurd that @SenateGOP censured her. #LetLizSpeak
Shameful
thank you for fighting for the American people.
Thanks picking up the letter and reading it. Superb move!
“... freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor, it must be demanded by the oppressed.” Mlk
Thank you for the read, Merkley. You might make an acceptable running mate if you keep this up.
Senator keep reading it. Each and every Democratic Senator needs to continue line by line. #wewillnotforgetpast
thank you!  #letlizspeak
now that you have been allowed to read the letter Senator Warren deserves an apology & her censure removed
If this is the GOP's plan to win over the so-called coastal elites, it may prove counterproductive.
Sit the F down
.@SenJeffMerkley @SenateGOP @SenWarren BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHAHAHA
It is Unbelievable!! Someone finally found a way to shut her up!!!

#ShutLizUp
Thank You Senator Merkley for your profile in courage! #LetLizSpeak
@DearAuntCrabby @SenateGOP @SenWarren so, did the next speaker get the speech to continue? If not, why not?
: She is a total nut job, total BS.
plz explain how Jeff was able to read it and not Liz? Sexism?
Thanks @SenJeffMerkley for reading the letter too. Every democrat should stand on the senate floor & read the letter!
@SenWarren Thank you!
.@SenJeffMerkley How about you Leftist podium- pounders respect the rules for a change? @SenateGOP @SenWarren #letlizspeak < 
NEVER!
thank you for your work. Keep going!
BLAH BLAH,,,you guys are embarrassing. ,..get TO WORK
The same one who faked heritage  to get ahead, that  Warren?
Way to step up! Good on you both.
Please retake the floor and read CSK's letter. Make them silence you all...one by one.  An injury to 1 is an injury to all.
Senate Democrats are too nice! When Democrats regain the Senate censure any @GOP who speaks out, even a little.
#Solidaridad #Solidarity
thank you for reading it! You are a true American hero.
Thank you Senator Merkley! And thank you Senator Warren. And SHAME ON YOU GOP.
scared of a woman again......
she deserved it. Obstructionism at its finest. What America voted against.
