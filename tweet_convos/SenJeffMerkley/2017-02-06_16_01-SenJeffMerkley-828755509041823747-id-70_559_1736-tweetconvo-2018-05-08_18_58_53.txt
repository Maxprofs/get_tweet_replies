No chance of the GOP putting country first. Horrible!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP Thank you! DeVos is not the answer! Our kids deserve better. #noDevos
how STUPID, DeVos will make an awesome education secretary.
@NEAToday @SenateGOP Thank you from a public school teacher. Appreciate you valuing our children over money. #NotoDeVos
Thank you, Senator Jeff Merkley
thank you! @SenateGOP
@SenateDems @SenateGOP @PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell @funder #BetsyDeVos believes schools are for those who can afford them.
thank you for continuing to stand up against DeVos. Holding out hope till last-minute for 1 more GOP.
confirm her! Stop your party POLITICS. She will be good for education.
oregon has one of the worst HS graduation record, are public schools at fault?
Every child deserves a good education.  Thank you@SenJeffMerkley and all the other Senators who oppose devos.
Thank you!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP Constitution doesn't even mention Education. Dept should be razed. Get back to work! #DoNothingParty
I can't believe they confirmed DeVos. They don't care about children, so they don't get to care about fetuses.
@SenateDems @SenateGOP Thank you Sen Merkley. Thank you for trying.
Thank you for standing up for what is right! DeVos lacks knowledge and law. #SAD #childrenfirst #NoOnDeVos

NO TO DEVOS! Just NO!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP thank you for taking a stand for our children.  No on Betsy DeVos.  Unqualified!
thank you!
THANK YOU!!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP Oh please, Oregon's graduation rate is abysmal. You don't care about education just politics
as an #Oregon voter I disagree. System broken. New eyes necessary.
Keep fighting the good fight. We are watching!
@SenateDems @SenateGOP Opposing DeVos means back to destitution of Democrats Plantation! System needs competitive choices
Oregon ranks 48 in high school grad rate. Maybe she can help because so far your picks have not helped.

It's over! She has the votes. Sorry, you lost again. Why not violent protest?

#NotoDeVos
Don't listen to @SenJeffMerkley about education. Oregon schools rank in bottom third nationally. @SenateGOP
keep going Jeff. I will vote for you again next time
standing with everything that is wrong with education teachers unions
thank you
Thank You!!!
they want make money off kids that's main reason. Jeff Merkley wants to keep that happening.#votemerkleyout
Thank You Jeff Merkley. Dump DeVos. She will ruin protections for students with disabilities, LGBTQ, minorities.
Thank you Senator Merkley for fighting hard to keep DeVos out of our public education.
I hope you guys fight Pruitt with the same fervor. His appointment could end life as we know it on this planet.
please stand up for public education, it is part of the social contract we have with each other #noDevos
Dump the department of education.  Give it back to the states and the parents.
Keep your stinking hands off of our kids.
Keep it up senator! Thank you for standing up for education, it is so very important!
I doubt we'll get another one to flip.  Blind party loyalty is a problem for both parties.
stand strong senator. Thank you!
Thank you, Sen. Merkley! Thank you for responding to your constituents and voting for US, not special interests!
They will do no such thing. Our kids education should be in OUR hands, not YOURS. Remember this during reelection
