Sen. Feinstein in 2006: You Can't Filibuster a SCOTUS Nominee Because You Disagree With Them https://pjmedia.com/video/sen-feinstein-in-2006-you-cant-filibuster-a-scotus-nominee-because-you-disagree-with-them/ â€¦ #Video via @pjmedia_com
Simple slick - Rs went "nuclear" and violated constitution by refusing to let a better qualified nominee (Garland) onto SCt. Rs hypocrites.
You have no idea the only time Nuclear Option was created and employed was by Reid and Dems do you?
Rs used filibuster >500 on Obama, wouldn't let him appt. SCt justice, so way worse than Gorsuch filibuster Pure hypocrisy/politics by Rs now
Again using the rules that have always been. Dems CHANGED the Senate rules to force thru federal judges via Nuclear Option. You were saying?
Explain why Rs' refusal to let Obama appt. justice is not worse than filibuster on Gorsuch? You were saying? I know you Rs can't explain...
Ask Biden. After all the "Biden Rule" was the basis for waiting....
Once again @TheDemocrats :

Do as I say, not as I do!
A pointless gesture and a waste of time. Imagine how much REAL work you could have done in those 16 hours. You know what "work" is, right?
Sounds like someone hasn't grabbed yours in a while. With that attitude, who'd want to?
lol bye now
This is going to be the best 8 years ever
hope your mom, dad and grandparents lose their social security! And I hope you never get to collect
Thrilled that those pockets won't be Clinton's
lol wanna bet, they're going to benefit from any tax cut welfare for the rich you obtuse person.
If Judge Scalia had not been murdered, no one would be having this conversation.
Thank you
Thank you for fighting for what is fair and honest. You are appreciated.
Thank you Senator.  Unfortunately, it isn't about Gorsuch being a qualified pick, it's about @GOP ramming something thru & breaking system.
Keep it up, you'll have 2 maybe 3 state legislatures in 2018 instead of the 5 you have now.
Thank you Senator Merkley for your real filibuster and facts about why Goruch is unfit to be on the SCOTUS. #BlockGorsuch=Unfit
He and the rest of Dems are hypocritical partisans lacking any principle. This fight is pathetic. Try standing for something
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley! Well done
Senator, you did a heroic job. Thank you!
Well done sir. Well done.
Thank you, @SenJeffMerkley!
How's it working for you? did it get it stopped? Who will remember in a day or two? Answer: nobody
Just a lot of Blah, Blah, Blah.  if you need 16 hours to make a case, you dont have one
Yawn
Don't worry Gorsuch will get confirmed.
Not w/out nuclear option. @McConnellPress invokes at his peril. @GOP won't be in power forever.
That's true, as the Dems are finding out.
Dems haven't been in power since 2010. Didn't you know that?
There the ones that set precedence,and changed the rules for the lower court which is why the GOP feels empowered to do it for the supreme
Do you know why Reid did that?
Same reason the GOP is doing it no one believes in bipartisanship anymore.
Thank you for standing up against the chaos of GOP leadership. They seem to be in over their heads. Dangerous for all
What's the record? #ImpeachDonaldTrump
The GOP the obstructionists!!!
Good little patsy...Did what he was Told to do. No brains...Sad!
thank you 
If ever there was an utterly frivolous waste of taxpayer dollars this was it. Not something to brag about.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley I wish more @SenateDems had stepped up to join you.
thank you for your efforts. McConnel isn't listening.  He is too giddy about having a dysfunctional president so gop railroad bills
Thank you, Senator Merkley.
Never forget that politicians have no principles other than conning you out of your $$ and your vote. #holdthefloor
Great effort @SenJeffMerkley and the other @SenateDems . Please keep up the fight!!
Just accept the result of the election, stop the idiocy, lose more seats in 2018 and be totally irrelevant, you're mostly irrelevant now.
Remember when the Republicans whinge they refused to confirm Obamas choice - and he was a candidate that should have been acceptable to all!
Democrats are Stalinist totalitarians who brainwash #resistance to fight against the very people who are saving country FROM totalitarianism
Typical rhetoric from brainwashed @realDonaldTrump supporters. The #Resistance is fighting against oppression and Tyranny. #ImpeachTrump
thank u senator
You seem to be an expert in this area
Thank you Senator Merkley for fighting the good fight.  Your constituents should be proud of how you fought for them.
Bullshit, you people are nothing but evil #DemocratsAreEvil. @TPPatriots @FoxNews @CNN @RealJamesWoods @WaPoSean
senator Bennett won't join the filibuster, I asked him to please leave the Dem party.  We need to primary him!
Gorsuch is corporate clone grown & programmed in Federalist Society tank
Bravo! Who is next? We expect you to #HoldTheFloor and #StopGorsuch @SenBillNelson
For how long? 

Nov. 2020?
The strongest case was to never vote Democrat again.
Big ups for @SenJeffMerkley!  Way to stand up!  #wherearetheadults?
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley I appreciate and applaud your efforts!
THANK YOU!!!!
THANK YOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOU THX!

Thank you, Sen Merkley for your valuable effort and to all the Democratic Senators who show the value of humanity and dedication.
Thank you!!
lol!
on your side here in Bremen/Germany. #respect
"Strong case" lol - You have NO CASE. If everything is hysteria, then nothing is.
Thank you Senator Merkley for making an outstanding case for voting NO on Judge Gorsuch and YES for starting hearings for Judge Garland.
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO REASONS TO STOP GORSUCH ON MERIT. HE HAS A 97% CONFIRMATION RATING - MEANING LIBERAL APPT. JUDGES AGREED WITH HIM.
Take this poll in solidarity for what you just did.
POLL: Should your Senators vote FOR or AGAINST Judge Neil #Gorsuch to be on the Supreme Court? #SCOTUS
THANK YOU, so proud to be an Oregonian!
you're a boob ..the fake filibuster for your ignorant voters  a  cloture had been called making your "filibuster" nothing but kabuki theater
Finally an end to this edition of pointless partisan bloviating. Vote to approve Gorsuch now.
Jeff you are a hero to many
"So... lunch, guys?"
-- Sen Jeff Markley
Is it over?
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley You are a true Patriot
They aren't going to approve of anything.  Their only job is Obstruction and creating racial hatred and wealth envy!
Thank you
Thank you for making it clear Gorsuch should not be confirmed!
You lose.  Keep on digging your grave.
Way to go, Senator.  @SenDonnelly @SenatorHeitkamp @Sen_JoeManchin take note: this guy's getting my share of your campaign contributions.
Haha! Good try but won't work.
That was impressive, he wasn't spewing gobbledegook, he was making sense and presenting facts!

THANK YOU.
Thank you Sen Merkley. As if there wasn't enough reason to love Oregon...you added another reason. & put country first. #FilibusterGorsuch
Now **that's** what I call stamina! Thanks to @SenJeffMerkley and the staff who supported you!
If you think you lost big in 2016 just wait til 2018!! We voters won't forget your stunts!! #NuclearOption

A valiant effort by the senator! @SenJeffMerkley
thank you @SenJeffMerkley your dedication and willingness to be a voice of the resistance is sincerely appreciated!
If Gorsuch makes the Supreme Court under our soon to be declared illegitimate president, I hope the other judges haze him until he resigns.
he's a hero! My friends in Oregon like him too. :)
The Democrats do not have a strong case to stop Gorsuch.
Ditto
He is the epitome of a true patriot...
Thank you for your effort, Senator!
Must be awful to think a Supreme Court Justice would side with the Constitution.  Uphold your oath of office.
Thank you!!

Thank you, Senator Merkley!

You guys better stand with him, @SenateDems! 
Thank you, sir.  You are a hero.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley ! We need more heroes like you!
@SenJeffMerkley  you are a badass. Thank you for your service to our democracy.
Thank you Senator Merkley!  So many in our country have lost their minds, hearts, and souls :(  We appreciate all you are doing!
ATTA BOY! #GoJeffGo #OregonRepresent #HoldTheFloor
This is what democracy looks like!!!  #resist #TrumpRussia #TrumpLeaks
Brave stand, sir, droning on all night about Gorsuch while the janitors mutter "Why cant he just shut up?"
Good lord,these Russian GOP bots need new hobbies.
should be super majority 4 all levels of judiciary from now on. We are too damn polarized & need centrist sanity
G-d bless him.. Go Senator Merkley!
And the rest of America says..."No one cares. You lost.  Elections have consequences.  Get over it."
Can't believe Democrats are forcing a nuclear option. That Reid Rule bit you in the butt.
Strong case?  Only if you mean NO case.  You're making a mistake here that will bite you but it will be hilarious later.
Poor case.
Much better cases made for removing the 4 rubber stamps of the left.
Yes thank you. After 8yrs of Trump conservatives will have a 7 to 2 majority in SCOTUS. Progressive agenda will be dead & buried for good.
Lol.
If by "strong case" you really mean "no case at all".
Irrelevant
if you are determined to waste everyone's time, at least step up your troll game & read some Dr. Seuss...
I'm sure this will resonate and change government forever, similar to @wendydavis did. Very powerful. Move over Rosa Parks and MLK
He must have drawn the short straw in your conference. A judge that votes w/ maj. 99% of time & is rarely overturned is "extreme" to you?
Merkley should undergo psychological evaluation. Based on #ObamaGate #WiretapGate #ObamaRussia #SusanRice evaluation is necessity.
Thank you senator
Bravo and thank you Senator Merkley. #StopGorsuch
You know how to flap your gums w/o much substance, not doing anything worthwhile for the citizens.
Thank you  Sen Merkley much appreciated resist
The Republicans'  games is always my way my rules they do the work any other way and always follow the money must be the greed then
Thank you for doing the right thing
Utter bullshit all 15+ hours.
unfortunately GOP do not care and are not listening. They are not big on doing the right thing. Garland Merrick?
16 hours of wasted breath later, you get nuked and a good man you demonized get his just due. Despite your petulant ravings. #hacks
@OlgaCollette THANK YOUUUU!!!!
Thank you for your strength and conviction.
I usually love performance art but prefer works that intend to move the audience to imagine new futures.
Thank you for standing and speaking for the American people This is not Gorsuch's seat to be appointed to. Judge Garland deserved hearings
YES!!!!!!!!!!
REPUBLICANS are cowards and babies. Their tantrum for the last 8 years is destroying this country.
Thanks Sen Merkley!!!
What happens now, can y'all keep it going?
Yeah but how many of you are going to vote for him?
You lose.
.@SenateDems @SenJeffMerkley who is up next? What's the plan? #holdthefloor
Yay. Sen Merkley. You stood up for We, the Little People.
THANK YOU! You can't be complicit in this sham by ignoring it.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
You democrats are the most disgusting form of life on earth.
GOOD JOB!
Do you have children grandchildren? Why are democrats trying so hard to keep us unemployed and unsafe? Is this what you want for your own?
Why does the GOP want to start more wars to sacrifice your children and grandchildren?
I think your last President along with the democratic party did that
Oh give us all a break. Gorsuch is and has always been eminently qualified. You drama queens are just throwing tantrums for spite. Grow up.
stay strong Yankees - we are with you - we are watching - we will donate - we see the #confederates @GOP - #RIPGOP
He made no case because there is no valid reason to #StopGorsuch. Partisan obstruction is not a valid reason.
#ConfirmGorsuch
@GorsuchFacts
Thank you!
With Dems insanity rules!!
The @GOP elected insanity @realDonaldTrump
Dems have proven over and over again how to hate everyone who does not agree with them. they are pure evil!!
He is perfect and you all know it
Roflmlao Rolling on floor laughing my Liberal Ass Off
We have to pick our battles... If Trump gets another pick, THAT is the one we should fight, as it's FAR more critical than this one
Nope! I disagree. THIS IS our fight. This one. Right now. Right here. But it is only the beginning
I'm not happy either, but he's getting through no matter what... This pick is not as important as the next one, that's all i'm saying
