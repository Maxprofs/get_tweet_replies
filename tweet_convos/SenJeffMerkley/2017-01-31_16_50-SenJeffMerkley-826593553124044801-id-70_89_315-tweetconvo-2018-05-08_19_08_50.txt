No.  You are becoming a true 'jakass' democrat! Get off the loony tunes fringe or U R unfit!
.@SenJeffMerkley Don't drive ratings for your bit on @maddow. Drive change for the ppl. Do, don't talk.
Please continue to lead the fight! This is a battle for America! #NoBannon. #ImpeachTrump
thank you for your leadership.  #HoldThisSeatOpen
the fear and hate mongering penetrated the rural voters more deeply. #resist #propaganda
The Nation's MAJORITY  Supports You! Merrick Garland or FILIBUSTER! @LAWRENCE @TRIBELAW.

Thank you, Senator! Feeling proud to be an Oregonian.
Was thrilled to see you on Rachel Maddow Show. Proud of, and thankful for, my congressman!
sorry for calling Sen Merkley my congressman. Obviously he is my wonderful senator!
I'd rather watch paint drying
nobody really cares about your worthless opinion anymore
 you're doing great.
Thanks for vow to fight this nomination.  This is a seat stolen from Obama. #resist
Not really, you're a political hack that only speaks for the liberals. 1/2 of OR dislike your talk.
LOVE  YOU   With you As Our Leader in this fight I Feel A CALMNESS. BUT I w Keep on goin
POTUS & co are insane monsters. What r u all going to do about it?
Great interview. We support you 100%. Thank you for your courage.
Just heard you, Great!! Our fight continues!!!
Thank you! I support your fillibuster on SCOTUS 100%. Great to see a Dem.taking serious action Go get em!
Senator Merkley you were fantastic!
Proud you're speaking for us Senator.
.@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump @maddow @MSNBC #Oregon is the new #Canada. May be seeing you soon. Thank you!
A resounding NO! Your silence will be greatly appreciated! #MuslimBan #MuslimBanprotest @realDonaldTrump @maddow @MSNBC
we stand with you Sen. Merkley and support the filibuster!!!
thank you!!!
make us proud Jeff. Put him in his place. The vast majority of the U.S. and Earth support U.
No, thank you.
I live in Colorado and you were awesome tonight! I love your spirit. Tell us how to help.
Sorry. Don't watch fake news.
Watching you now on Rachel Maddow. Please stick by your guns. This is one battle we must win
Yes! As an Oregon citizen I thank you and am so proud!
Watching now and standing with you! @realDonaldTrump @maddow @MSNBC
Support you & appreciate you Mr. Merkley! Merrick Garland was denied even a meeting! Resist.
Do you think Oregon is behind your obstructionist efforts?
No.
turn to Rachel? lol...sponge bob reruns have higher ratings. b the tree falling in the woods
as a resident of OR the woman answering the phone at office said you were making a point by being a cry baby she was rude!!
you have to work to be paid I'm an OR resident you are a disgrace to the state and this country you will not be re elected
No one wants to hear you or Maddie Jeff.
I'll be there!
@ @maddow @MSNBC I freaking LOVE you! Hug! Hug! Hug! Thank you!
NO and NEVER
I part of the reason Trump won is people want a conservative Supreme Ct. you lost move on
Hoping you stand by your word and filibuster this nomination. Republicans made their bed, now they can lay in it. #SCOTUS
Oregon is too blue to even matter - next time though you are gone
Pass.
Thank you for standing for progressives & others, whether they know they benefit.
no new justice unless it's merrick garland #resist
I don't know hardly anybody who would watch @msnbc let alone this madcow woman!  LOL
It's naive to believe you shouldn't fight Trump's SCOTUS pick. This is why Dems are doomed to fail. So disappointed.
I hope the citizens of Oregon stand up and oust you next election cycle. Have a nice day.
happy to see you fighting for us senator. yr constituents are fired up and will #resist. remember those town halls!
Not until he is off the air & not sure about watching @MSNBC anymore. #blackout
Nope! You have nothing to say of any intelligence.
if it's Gorsuch, defend assisted suicide. It's a big part of what makes Oregon awesome.
#NO PDX RIOTER SenJeffMerkley
