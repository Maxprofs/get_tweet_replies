@WarriorsMAGA
I know of retired people who worked hard all their lives to now wonder if they will have healthcare. How do people not care?
Marry I paid into SSI all my life. But Crooks like Merkley tapped into it and robbed us blind. Russian come over her get put on SSI !!!
People have signed up since I was a little kid. That is a problem,but what is happening right now will impact people who put $ in all along.
What about the Demos that tap into it. They say they are for the middle class when all they do is screw us.
65 & above will have Medicare as we do now.and possibly a gap just like now
You read that?
Thank you for your service.
You and you supporters are leeches. Pay for your health care and stop depending on others.
A million thanks for your hard work. It feels good to know you are there fighting hard.
A strategy you say you have never seen but seem to be an expert on
I love what you're doing but the dems need to realize that the leadership needs to change. Pelosi, Schumer, Debbie Schultz need to move on.
Thank you!!
Thank you!  Please keep fighting for our values.  Americans deserve better than how the Senate GOP are secretly crafting a terrible bill.
Just a hint but it's easier to fight standing up unless you have some new MMA strategy. Ha ha.
You are a rock star!
Keep up the good fight! Put a spotlight on what's really in the GOP bill. What are they afraid of. They know it's for the rich and not kids
Yep doing well! But looking at your other posts you sound unhinged and talking conspiracies lol. 3 mil illegals voted. Watch Alex Jones much
You were not elected to be an obstructionist. Stop.
Be strong!
Thank you sir!
Merkley under Obama care. People buying there own insurance in your state are going to be paying 22to 36 % more. What about them!!!!
ThankU Sir and #God #Bless #U for fighting for us. 
#HealthCare
The only thing you're fighting for is your own seat in the senate and to live the rest of your miserable life at the taxpayers expense.
Why didn't you fight for us to fix the piece of crap you fools fraudulently forced upon America with zero knowledge of what was in it? FOOLS
But it was ok for Pelosi to hold up the Obamacare doc & say, you have to pass it to see what's in it.  Hypocrite!!
You are not fighting for the American citizens Merkley, you refused to even work on healthcare  by obstructing.  You are useless to America
Thank you for fighting for what is right.
Your the Man Jeff!
You make OR proud!

What's at stake? Hundreds of millions given to illegal aliens, despite liar Obama's lies that it wouldn't happen?
$700 million in Obamacare subsidies had been paid to ineligible aliens by 2015, the Verify First Act would stop this http://ow.ly/nrb430cHMzm

Thank you for your commitment to the basic principles of democracy. Keep fighting! You are a hero.
Thank you Senator Merkley!
Better than the Dem strategy: 
a)import millions of 3rd-worlders to vote Dem
b)funnel medical & social funds from Americans to pay for them

I'm still with you! So right, over 200 billion dollars will be diverted to people who set the prices, and make money off of sick Americans
Thank you from CA.

Keep fighting the good fight @SenJeffMerkley I like seeing some backbone in #Democrats #resist #AHCAKills
If there's one thing you Democrats hate it's the prospect of losing a source of tax revenue.
Thank you Jeff!! 
My daughter's future is at stake. If insurance caps are allowed to return, she won't ever have health coverage! $1 million in under 8 weeks!
God bless you!
