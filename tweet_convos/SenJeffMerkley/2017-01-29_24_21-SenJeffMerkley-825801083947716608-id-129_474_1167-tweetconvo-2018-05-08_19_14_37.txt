@KGWNews How about you uphold the will of the people you nut. You lost now suck it up and go home
You live in a liberal state so suck it up. #NoBanNoWall
I don't have to suck it up.The pot smoking tree huggers lost The good people here finally have a voice!
Jenny you are a special kind of deplorable. What's it like to have all that hate seething inside?

These are low class thugs
Thank you for fighting for America.
anybody mentioned that Trumps ban prevents 2 of the 16 Nobel Peace Prize winners in 21st century from entering the country
@Oregon4Bernie Liberty and justice for those convicted of crimes?
TY @SenJeffMerkley!!!
Thank you, on behalf of constituents who support the protest but could not make it to PDX today.
Core values? For ALL? What a joke? You are an embarrassment!
I'm curious how this protest, which is infringing on the rights of folks to freely fly out of PDX, is supposed to help?
Yeah, and beating people up!
hell yes
protesters crossed line beat a man unconscious You go there YOU will have his blood on ur hands too. This is out of control
please explain to us how President Trump's temporary immigration ban is unconstitutional? Or are you just whining?
@KGWNews You create dangerous place @ PDX Do this@a fed bldg where Pple who work there, airlines & travel aren't affected
@KGWNews Oregon politicians should be more concerned with protecting the citizens from terrorist attacks.
@Barbara_AOK @SenJeffMerkley @KGWNews they'll just come back with some bullshit about white supremacist kill more than terrorists
Please continue to fight to uphold our Constitution and maintain civil liberties for all!!!!
you are an embarrassment to our state.
I'm so so proud that you are my senator, Jeff.  Stay strong.  I support you!!
It is time for Americans to have a full throttle march for Impeachment of Trump.
who's core values? Your liberal core values that that create a greater threat to our nation!
Core values, what value says we can't screen refugees? Just protest everything, we will win again!
thank you!
Thank you for being at the PDX protest !!
you're awesome!
thank you!
THANK YOU for being an elected official that I can really believe in.
That's a bad idea given the text of the Executive Order. You are way out of line and theatrical at this point. Embarrassing.
...countries. How about Carter banning Iranians? Obama blocking Iraqis? How come you folks didn't freak out then? Hypocrisy?
Senator, many disagree with you & tired of being ignored. Muslim ban would include more than 4 of the top 24 Muslim...
thank you for standing for what is right.
thank you Senator, for helping us fight for what's right. You are appreciated.
Thank you, Senator. Keep up the fight. We need your voice.

I thank @realDonaldTrump for keeping us safe and following thru with his promises. I trust him way more than you!

You were fine when Carter and Obama enforced travel bans. You're nothing more than a political hack. #BoycottPDX

Apples & Oranges. Learn more than the talking points. #bless

Stay a proud American sickened by rampant misogyny, racism, xenophobia, and disregard for American values? Yes.
