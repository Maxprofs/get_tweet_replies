Exxon CEO as #SecretaryofState will be able to approve KXL pipeline. An oilman shouldn’t be running int’l climate policy. #DrainTheSwamp
With labor law violator @ DOL & EPA opponent @ EPA, Exxon CEO running int'l climate negotiations makes sense in Trumpworld. Not in reality.
you have done almost nothing to help the people of Oregon.. yet you expect us to respect your opinion.. pfft..
the Russian issue has not been proven yet you would use it to discredit the man we elected and his choice of cabinet.. shame
10/17/16 such claims were considered bogus and anti-Americans https://mediamatters.org/video/2016/10/17/cnn-presidential-historian-trumps-rigged-election-claim-bogus-and-anti-american-its-core/213872 …
@Sanddragger @JWitaconis @selmarose40 @SenJeffMerkley
I would think a Senator is getting it from the report. If it's true, does it bother U?
Your ok to be drafted in war with China, cause Trump wants hotel in Taiwan?
recount effort wasn't going to work so they come up with "Russia" with no real sources or proof
don't forget @FBI  said no dice on Russia. U don't wanna believe them for that but do when they say Hillary innocent. Lol
Until you furnish dates, times, and intrusions times this is all bull shit. Stop wasting my tax dollar & do some good.
Yea, abSenatir is gonna put specifics out like this without a report. Are any of U squirming yet?  Is this OK?
We are not, but it's plain to see you people are scared shit less..
Not me, I live in Belize mostly, but when he gets his men posted in every community I bet ur sweet Arse will b
maybe this person can reason with the Russians.
keep going. We’re with you
NO!
Not me...
no & neither is this @realDonaldTrump forgot about 200 Russian Businesses he's involved with #Trump
Who cares what we think what are you going to do about it along with the rest of his cabinet????????????
@BillinPortland Trump apologists, EXXON execs and Goldman Saks does. #usefultools
No, LOCK HIM UP!  TRAITOR!
definitely not!
Hell no, thanks for asking. You & @RonWyden should sit down with Rep Walden, get him to join #TheResistance too. #Oregon
This constituent does not think any of it is ok. Appreciate your attention to the issue.
Please do you job to the best of your ability and protect the people.
@MoveOn Not I.
People who support Trump have no problem with it. Ask anyone who voted for Trump and they will tell you it doesn't matter.
Not the older folks who are second guessing this Trump, they are beginning to see the truth!
How about leading by example and stop the gossip. #GetToWork
you are in a much better position to do something about it! After all, that's why you were put into office.
Nope! Except Trump and the groupies who pray at his altar.
Apparently the GOP is fine with it
no it's not okay
@MoveOn The pt is that HRCs disdain towards Americans of all race color creed was revealed&OMG her corruption was widespread
@MoveOn no it's not okay!!!  So please do your job, and stop it!!!  You too @RoyBlunt
I do not
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. . . Maybe it's his secret strategy. We shall see
thank you for standing up when so many are normalizing this. Proud to have voted for you and will be happy to do so again.
@MoveOn No.

, Brave New World, or 1984?
Is anything being done about Comey?
Congress better not approve these guys.
Nothing about any of this is ok yet it doesn't seem like anything is being done about it!
and what are you doing about it besides tweeting?
62 million fools sure do. Sad.
#LOCKHIMUP #Traitorinchief
@DigitalDaggers I MOVE FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN OUT PRESIDENT ELECT. @realDonaldTrump
no it's not ok! Democrats need to fight back!
That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works
what are you guys doing about it? This is a successful attack on our freedom and democracy.
Russia wanted Trump to win to Make America Great Again.
Hey Buddy while #Dems Play Coy & 1PartyRule is set by @GOP why wld #DJT not act as he does?#GOP in DC backs him
No one thinks it's okay. Fight senator with everything you've got!!!!
bullshit
The US invaded Iraq & Afghanistan, engages killer drones in Yemen & Pakistan. Before Trump. You think that's ok?
No, definitely not.  Shout it from the rooftops.
The same people that had issues with President Obama meeting with Castro, have absolutely no problem with this. SMH
Pretty obvious whats going on there!
Nope, common sense dictates this is a conflict of interest for the USA unless it will be compromised by foreign gov.
@MoveOn Horrible!
Absolutely NOT. This constituent will support you in stopping the appointment.
Russia NECK deep in Syrian genocide - what are we doing about that? We don't need that kind of Russian friendship.
@MoveOn no! Save us
I think we need to start with open primaries in Oregon. Give democracy chance. What do you think?
Absolutely and unequivocally not.
Is it so important for the GOP to have a W that they'll sell an entire nation of 335 million ppl for parts? Oil-Banking-etc
@SenJeffMerkley
@MoveOn I for one do not.
@MoveOn not ok!
I think it is great,he is not a politician
@MoveOn no but is there recourse? We 'll protest till hell freezes over, but office holders,electors have the power
Not okay. Please get a special prosecutor to investigate as well as Congress. Thank you!!
@MoveOn It is imperative for Immediate Bipartisan Investigation of Russian hacking for DJT. Also need Security Brief of EC!
The initial campaign was to discredit Clinton hence the e-mails. Russia never thot Trump would win. Bonus 4 KGB!
@MoveOn -apparently not many think it is wrong- including most Republican senators and the media- Kanye=shiny object
NO!! but more than likely you all will not step up. If any of this *&^% happens,its on ElecCollg heads. Ppl voted 4 Hillary
@moveon Corrupt Sec's of State elected Trump - Palast is usually correct. Russia may be minor issue/big diversion- neocons.
@MoveOn
No sir.  Please do what you can to derail this.
No proof
#LIAR #FAKENEWS
Apparently Trump's Deplorables do!
not ok! The Trump is a traitor as he doesn't believe the 17 US national intel agencies!
Even Alex Jones has more proof of his conspiracies than you do.

WHACKO TIN FOIL HAT LEFTY
Nice whacko conspiracy theory.

Remember when Democrats used to be anti-war? YOU GOT CO-OPTED BY NEO-CONS!
every republican in congress save one or toe thinks it's peachy keen
Only one candidate was paid millions by Russia. The candidate you endorsed!
Draw attention away from the problems in the USA. 
Blame somebody else so we do not notice you are not doing your job.
NOPE. What is Congress going to do about it, Senator? (I'm your constituent.)
Thank you.
.@SenJeffMerkley this constituent emphatically does not think it's okay. Counting on you, @RonWyden & @RepPeterDeFazio  to fight like hell.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. And I think Cheetolini  (@realDonaldTrump ) just appointed @kanyewest  as Secretary of Mental Health.
@capeannsky Thank you for taking a strong stand.
Sen Merkley has repeatedly called T---- and Bannon out on a number of matters since the election.
No! Please help us.
Ah, NO!!
yes... and Russia made Clinton a lying psychopath
declassify the proof please. folks ignored my warnings and now we have trump.If @BernieSanders got a fair shake we wouldn't
is the new King of #FakeNews,  perpetuating misinformation in his impotent rage filled twitter soliloquy .  Good times.
No, this is not OK. Thank you for your integrity and courage. Keep pushing back against this.
This is a rhetorical question, correct? For the sake of our country I implore you to convene an independent investigation.
no, it's not ok. Please do whatever you can to stop it.
@bizacco @SenJeffMerkley Not in the least. We need independent congress and EV review w/CIA info and all of DJTs tax returns!!
EC obv. Thank you.
Yep. Republicans. Republican's are proving what spineless hypocrites they are.
didn't u back @HillaryClinton 4 @TheDemocrats nomination? Well now u got exactly what u deserve! #DemExit 4 me @GreenPartyUS

HELL NO, ITS NOT OKAY! NONE OF THIS IS OKAY! #NotMyPresident #StillWithHill #TheResistance #BeautifulBlueOregon #USA
