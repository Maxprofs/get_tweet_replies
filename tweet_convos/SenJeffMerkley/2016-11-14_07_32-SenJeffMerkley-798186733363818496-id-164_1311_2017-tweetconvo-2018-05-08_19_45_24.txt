Thank you for speaking out.
@TRHogFan so the voters are racists, Trump is racist, right wing means racist. Dang, what a crazy world
Bannon is definitely racist.
Proof, please; I've asked many for proof, and they simply cite opinion. 
@Willis614 @SenJeffMerkley

The first sentence mentions a claim made in an acrimonious divorce as worthy of consideration; I'm out.
@Willis614 @SenJeffMerkley
what about his other appointments? Want to see the WHOLE picture or just piss/moan about part of it?
It's the latter, of course.  The same peeps who never questioned HRC or POTUS are up in arms now.
@SenJeffMerkley @nybooks
Maybe. I try to avoid generalizations and do my own research. Hard for some to accept.
I'm still looking for evidence that Bannon is fascist/racist/white-supremacist etc.; so far, nothing.
@SenJeffMerkley @nybooks
I've found the usual sources, but nothing substantiated. Still looking...
TY!
The main claim seems 2 center around the claims made by Bannon's ex-wife during their acrimonious divorce, so #GrainOfSalt
Also, there seems 2B an issue w what has been written by contributors on Breitbart, but IDK how much control Bannon has, so…?
I don't either...still researching though.
no alt right its kkk period
Way to go, Senator! U r helping ALL Americans! @EastsidePDXAir @politico @CNNPolitics
Keep flying the false flag proudly and no Dem will ever get elected again. Anti-Semite heads DNC is fine though, right?
thank you, Senator. I'm proud to have voted for you
thank you Senator Merkley
Thank you for this, Senator Merkley.
Thank you for standing up and speaking out about this inappropriate choice. Support you 100%
Thank you
not alt-right; try calling it what it is, white supremacism
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley & @RonWyden for being unapologetic & unafraid to speak out against those who seek to bring hate to the White House
Absolutely unacceptable. Thank you for speaking out.
love you. stay strong
Thank you for standing up for what is right. Proud you are my senator
Thank you for speaking out and standing up for all Americans. My vote for you is secure as long as you keep speaking out.
thank you!! What can you do as our senator to help stop this appointment?
Please prove Bannon is racist; I've seen no fact, only Democrats & "TedCruz"-type GOPs having fits b/c they've lost power.
"racist alt-right" is a tautology.  Alt-right = racist.  Just say "racist."
keeping a white nationalist out of the White House is a moral, bipartisan imperative. Keep speaking truth! #StopBannon
Also NOT OK: Trump kids getting top-secret govt clearance. SOMEONE MUST TELL HIM NO to mixing our govt w/his bus. goals!
Oregon thanks you!
Thank you for doing everything you can to protect American rights and values, Senator!
Well done, sir. Thank you for speaking out.
@JoeTrippi As Obama said, elections have consequences.
Senator, they're KKK not alt right
This constituent and her family thank you.
Thank you for all you do for us grateful Oregonians.
Seriously, stop throwing around the word "racist".  Where's the proof? This BS outrage is partly why Trump won.
Thank you for standing up for what is right!!
Thank-you sir. I would consider moving to Oregon to support you!
Thank God you're irrelevant
do you have any proof he is a white supremacist? Making these kind of assumptions in your position is irresponsible.
@ThomasB00001 so what are you going to do about it? Can anyone do anything? Or wait till Rome is burning?
I like that Bannon is all for term limits, clearly that bothers you but you won't admit it.
thank you. We are seeing swastikas and other racist/anti-semetic graffitti around where i live...it's frightening
thank you!
Thank you for making a statement about Trump's pick of Bannon. We need your leadership, thank you for speaking out.
Thank you for denouncing this man and his vile hatred. More senators need to follow your lead!
Thank you, Senator
Thank you for speaking out on this
I agree with you. Let's hope @realDonaldTrump will pick a better person.
stop using the term alt-right. They are neo NAZIs and that is the proper label.
Thank you Senator for standing up to hate!
thank you senator for standing up on this
Jeff you're an embicle!
@sierraclub about time, congressional leaders should be standing on their desks screaming
@JanieceStaton The protests, demonstrations, and marches will, and must, continue. We must express outrage at this election.
TY 
Thank you!
stop normalizing white supremacists by calling them "alt-right." Call a spade a spade.
Thank you for speaking out
Please also post and share via your Facebook page. Makes more accessible.
Thank you so much!
Thank you, Senator, for standing up and fighting.
Thank you @SenJeffMerkley
Trump’s appointment of racist alt-right champion Bannon to a senior post demeans the office and is unacceptable https://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/merkley-denounces-appointment-of-white-nationalist-to-top-white-house-post …
@JJohnsonLaw we cannot turn the WH into a klan rally
Whites are going to be taking our own side from now on, and we're not going to apologize for this. Cry harder.
thank you for releasing this statement, your constituents appreciate it!
This ultra-liberal opinion.  Bannon is not a racist just because Democrats state a claim without proof.
I'm sure N. Korea would embrace @SenJeffMerkley openly... Another #BooHooer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mki6zS6hkp0 … #mondaymotivation
we need to stop using the term alt-right and call it what it really is
but Trumps the president and he knows whats best for your country
@joshtpm

Thank you.
Don't just love all these mutts that think they have the right to run Trump's gig because they don't like him.
Thank you - stand strong!
I appreciate your principles.  Thank you!!
Other democrats need to be unified in calling this monstrosity out. Please let your colleagues know!
God bless you.
Thank you for speaking up! We need your voice. You will be remembered in history.
Thank you for your statement on the appointment of Bannon.
Thank you Senator. Leadership is apprciated.
thanks for your comments on this
.@SenJeffMerkley Unacceptable to whom?  @StephenBannon is extremely intelligent and he is certainly qualified.  Quit race baiting.
that is what the left does they have ZERO thanks2the clinton's they haven't brought anyone
along
Thank you.
THANK YOU, and please stay loud!
what do you propose to do? It's wonderful to express sentiment but you're the one with power. We the people have none.
@LOLGOP call him what he is: a Nazi.
@nybooks What would he say had Bannon made Chief of Staff? This is just political positioning, readers deserve better.
See how it's done, Claire? @clairecmc
Thank you for standing up to this.
Humanity at a crossroad: Will populism, nationalism and fascism push humanity again into the abyss?
please speak out strongly agst this and encourage others in Congress. So far, not many are
thank you for speaking out. keep fighting for us.
he he he..
why don't you try a little uniting instead of dividing...quit labeling people that don't agree with you racist...
Steve Bannon also wants federal and economic collapse, to incite massive civil unrest.
you certainly have an appropriate photo; you look like Satan; peace man...try a little kindness.
I'm sorry if anything I said was unkind, but fact remains that Bannon is a dangerous man.
I agree what he said is scary but I think he meant we need to drain the swamp of dirty politics..
Thank you.
Mr Bannon denied antisemitic remarks in private. What public racist statements has he made? 
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/27/trump-campaign-ceo-stephen-bannon-denies-antisemitic-remarks …
check out breitbart. or remain in the dark. people aren't protesting around the world because the D candidate lost.
Thank you. Keep fighting the good fight. We are all counting on you.
without the vote on his cabinet for as long as you can until that man is out.
@LOLGOP it makes us all very uncomfortable
not some of the people responding to this post...
#ElectoralCollege Designed to Stop Rogue Candidates. Push this option. FoundingFathersWouldBeProud. TrumpTooDangerous
Thank you. We cannot let this country slide into fascism.
@LOLGOP thank you senator for actually saying this.
Most in Congress are progressive left wingers.
THANK YOU #LoveTrumpsHate
That's pretty funny. The only #BooHooers throwing a hissy fit are the one's rioting. #SorosRiots
@nybooks Thank you, Senator Markley. Stay strong.
@LOLGOP Finally, a Democrat willing to call him what he is: a racist. Thank you.
Thank you for speaking out!  Please urge your party members to be the party of backbone and truth.
The only backbone they have...
Thank you!!!
Thank you, Senator. Standing up to this insult to American values is much appreciated. Met u in NH on yr birthday.
just glad it's not your job to appoint anyone on his staff
Me, too...
Thank you.
