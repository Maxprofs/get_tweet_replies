yes that appears to be a significant issue
more crapola from people who cheat and lie like they breath.
He should no better. No excuse. Tax law not a secret.
At the VERY LEAST congress should pass a bill making it a requirement.  No taxes? Your name is not on the ballot
Keep up the pressure on these ill thought out nominees. You have our gratitude.
Please encourage all Democrats to obstruct any & all actions by #GOP and Steve Brannon's puppet tRump! Thank you!
NO ! They need 2 pay taxes as well ! I have been paying in 4 over 49 years. Now they want 2 take it away ! NO
I agree, that is not good.
Keep it up!  Unsuitable nominee, to say the least!
@SenSchumer @politico Big deal. Move on already.
I'm glad you are questioning this.
@SenSchumer @politico no way Jose. Next. Please vote NO
: You obstructionist Dems don't seem to get it, you lost & America is sick of your liberalism. Get off the dime....
@SenSchumer @politico NO EXCUSE.  Neither are the 69 foreign workers hired recently at ma-a-lago. 1 American
Rep. Mick Mulvaney, @RepMickMulvaney, Trump is a fraudster and must be expelled, TRUE or FALSE? The world is watching. @senjeffmerkley
Are WeThePeople the only ones that pay taxes.
@SenSchumer @politico I vote for cheating. Price & DeVos have already over-used "clerical errors".
you need 2 look up the repeal of the stock act before you listen 2 them criticize price
Price was trading stocks he was making laws on. Optic is bad for insider trading.
congress is allowed to trade on information they have prior to public knowledge.
Will review the law but that is shameful.
Let's see your tax returns Merkley. Who paying you off???
Definitely not!  New cabinet=Democracy Traded for Oligarchy
WHEN U SHOWED MULVANEY THE LARGE PHOTOS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 2009 & 2017 INAUGURATION....U MADE MY DAY 
Obama said my parents could keep their doctor, then their premiums went from $300 and change to $700 in change LMFAO #FACTS
He wants to "fix" Social Security & Medicare too. Can't wait! I will look into stock cardboard boxes...housing!
so you would rather have someone who does not care about budgets?
You support millions of illegals not paying taxes god forbid you don't 1099 the babysitter #hypocrisy
he is a crook. He wasn't careless he just got caught
pat the crook on the back, the republicans did. White men get another pass a black man would be in jail
Nice way to tie in the inauguration attendance to his confirmation hearing!
should we take advice from our senators who think insider trading is ok for them but not for citizens?
Trump has serious mental health issues to ramble on the way he did at CIA,& in meeting with Dems & GOP
The fact that you bring up a comparison of 2 photos on crowd numbers just tells me you're not qualified 2vote
WHEN are we going to see Trump's taxes? The petition has over 300K signatures now
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/immediately-release-donald-trumps-full-tax-returns-all-information-needed-verify-emoluments-clause-compliance …
Definitly NOT the right person!
@SenSchumer @politico Mulvaney evade taxes? Cheating or careless? Timothy Geithner Timothy Geithner Timothy Geithner hello?
So far you and Sen Wyden have voted No on EVERY Senate vote. EVEN when party leaders voted AYE. Pathetic !
absolute no vote!
FYI This is the CORRECT Image 4 the @POTUS  inauguration. What you showed was 6 hrs before #SMARTASS
http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/01/politics/trump-inauguration-gigapixel/ …
@SenSchumer @politico What, you wouldn't have trusted him to make your secret trillion dollar cash night drop to Terhan?
you really are acting like a child you and the rest of the Democrats and all the celebrities it's actually pretty pathetic
whatever happened to Dems going high when they go low because right now the dems r the only one going low & that's a fact!
hearing because that picture was completely wrong the right side was taken at 9 AM please show his crowd at 12
i'm not saying trumps crowd was bigger because I think Obamas was bigger I'm talking about the picture you held up in the
I really hope you correct yourself or I will post the 12 o'clock picture with your name
what you did in that hearing was absolutely horrible you were so wrong that picture on the right was taken at 9 AM
Was Geithner who evaded $34K in taxes from working at the IMF the right person to be SOT in 2009? Hypocritical!
Ask him!
Pic u held up taken 9:15am #CNNFakeNews Here's 2017 at 12:03pm Ppl like u are why Trump won. #LiberalismIsADisease
@SenSchumer being Jewish in name only you know what rhymes with Chuck. And it fits u to a t
Such a disgraceful question about crowd size, what a waste of time.
Tim Geithner didn't pay his taxes and got a pass!
@SenSchumer @politico Talking about evading taxes, why don't u talk about ur so-called hero John Lewis, and Sharpton.
@SenSchumer @politico Trump & Trump Admin. all have Amnesia when it comes to paying Taxes and/or know how to avoid taxes.
What about the Dem appointments of Obama & Clinton who owed a heck of a lot more than $15k...but were approved
you shamefully used fake news in a confirmation hearing. Everyone knows Applebaums inauguration screencap is inaccurate
Thanks for adding to the pettiness of your party with photo comparison today 
This is the very reason why Democrats will lose more seats in future elections... "Crowd Size" really Senator? Wow.
@SenSchumer @politico same can be said about our president
FORWARD TO ALL SEN/CONGRESS @SenJeffMerkley @SenSchumer @politico @SenSanders @JordanUhl @realAlexaPark @YouGiveMeFever7 @LawyerRogelio
Lifetime Dem who voted Trump. You lost me for good . Embarrassing for the Dems.
NO NO --Cheating on taxes----like Orange Cheeto
I don't know why you didn't ask that question instead of the CROWD size of @Potus inauguration.. Ridiculous!
@SenSchumer @politico Does gop live n such a bubble of denial that they think they aren't transparent? This IS embarrassing
see you in Tigard on Saturday!
@SenSchumer @politico These Entire hearings are a sham. The ONLY thing that is being revealed is blatant gop hypocrisy
@AJentleson @politico he came out corruption is corruption no matter how much
@SenSchumer  NO NO.  This snowflake sticks with all others who will not stand for dishonesty, any longer.
is Jared Kushner a proper appointment given his family's history of FEC fines and electioneering felonies?
No cheaters, liars or stupid people. Thank you for yr integrity. You're wonderful. I'm privileged to have ur voice for us.
@SenSchumer @politico familiar disqualifier in the real world of ethics
@SenSchumer @politico way more concerned with the guy places stock market buys based on his inside info & influence
@clairecmc @RoyBlunt  NO on this man please Budget Management? Where?
the nanny probably didn't want to report the income. Anybody asked this?
How does the DEM party feel about this? "SHUT DOWN WHITE PEOPLE!" Liberal party BATTLE CRY!
.@SenJeffMerkley @SenSchumer @politico We're his actions unlawful? Let's audit members of congress to see if they're in compliance. Liars
@SenSchumer @politico excuse me what about trump don't you people care the man is hiding something find it! We pay you
@SenSchumer @politico Not only can he not be confirmed he needs to resign
NO   NO   NO...
@SenSchumer @politico These people have no business in our government. Stop bending over for Repubs and help the people.
gee I suppose no DEM in CONGRESS EVER made a filing mistake. EVER
Hmm. Like Obama's 1st Treasury Sec?
Does he have to be told each day how to do his job and what to look for?? THIS IS NOT the job for you!
Oh, but the rules don't apply to them!
@SenSchumer @politico SHAME ON U!  While the special interests line your pockets! COME ON! #MAGA 
@SenSchumer @politico Even I know you have to, to be able take a tax deduction. Duh
@SenSchumer @politico  No! He should NOT manage anything!
@SenSchumer @politico caught his mistake himself and corrected it himself and voluntarily paid any fines or fee. u r a hack
@SenSchumer @politico Please Mr Senator...U all hv been doing our budget for 8 yrs!  REALLY! #MAGA
@SenSchumer @politico have you any decency!? You are but snakes dressed as men.
@SenSchumer @politico 
All make mistakes. Responsible grown-ups correct them and do better.  Snowflakes double down.
Nope.
@AJentleson @politico seriously. Have you people no shame!!
