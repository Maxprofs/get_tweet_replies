You are the last person to criticize anyone for being political...the man who steadfastly will not stand up to this President as he destroys the very underpinnings of our democracy! History will treat you more like a traitor than a great leader....
At least he got hearings, you hypocrite.
Protect your country!!
You should know.
By rights Pompeo should not be confirmed to be dog catcher. A hateful, narrow minded human. This is what you want to champion? Dreadful.
Like your refusal to follow the Constitution for the nomination to the Supreme court?  What a phony
Have you listened to what Americans are saying about you? Wait, you won't listen to anyone but your enablers.

Smart and hard working? Thats the Job Description?
It was a Republican senator from Kentucky that flipped, Rand Paul. Either feed your soul with the truth or lying.
You need to stop pointing fingers and do what is right for the country.  Your partisan politics is detrimental to the country.
Maybe it's that he doesn't "believe in" climate change?  Oh, and #MerrickGarland
Spineless Mitch caves every time to #resistance why the hell are you delaying vote on #VA Secy because of (D) lies & resist  @SenateGOP @SenMikeLee @RandPaul @SenTedCruz The Senate is a joke Ditch Mitch get a real leader with a spine who will get rid of arcane filibuster rule
Dotard
Delete your account and resign.

I'm still waiting for any explanation of why so many in the Trump campaign were meeting Russians. Why? "It's not illegal" doesn't put me at ease as a plausible explanation. https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/990168776808255488 …
He LIED!
Change the rules Mitch.  Enough is enough.  Dems don't play fair.  Never did, never will.  The more you appease, the more they demand and the nastier they get
It could be political blackmail from your end! What did you promise them, MM?
I’ve seen better looking smiles on a corpse

Flip flopping on a political issue? Maybe they're following @Potus @realDonaldTrump' s lead.
Why are no Dems invited to tonight’s state dinner? Politics?? #failinggop
Well I stand corrected-according to the Wash Post there were a few Dems at the dinner including the Gov of Louisiana. It’s okay to acknowledge it when you make a mistake.
Dems did not praise Pompeii. They've actually vetted him, which is why the few who may have taken a 'let's see' stance are now sure he's wrong for the position. You know, like everyone else in this administration, tRumps cabinet, all whom he nomomates, and the gop.
'Politics'? You don't know any better. You'll be gone soon. 

And he lies like TRUMP, YOU, AND RYAN
You are not credible. Did your mamma teach you about integrity? #MerrickGarland
A poor choice!
Just like you when you didn't allow a vote on Merrick Garland! Or was that not politics, and ideology?
Cause the constitution doesn't say wait a year, or the next election to consider a nominee!
Get the @POTUS ' nominees through. Stay in session everyday, (long days), until your work is done.
Sens Isakson just asked the Pentagon for everything written too, on, or about Trump's nominee for VA. WTF is going on in your caucus? This will take months and plays directly into Schumer's Obstructionist Actions. Shut this down or cut it down to one or two specific questions.
How about he's a war monger who will side with Bolton and trump no matter what he does to our country?
It’s politics! Change the rules! They will!
Because they started seriously looking into his leanings and decisions.  Bad dude
Maybe they think it is stupid to walk away from the Iran deal. Maybe you should do your job, and vote no as well
Our freedom you Kleptocratic Kompromat King.
How about him LYING ABOUT HIS MILITARY SERVICE?????
I suppose it could be becasue he has publicly stated that he is anti-Muslim, anti-LGBT and anti-Woman and this position is for Secretary of State - where you represent what your country stands for and against -  not the EPA or the CIA.
Refusing to bring a bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller to the floor - what could it be other than politics?
Maybe common sense?  Maybe intelligence?  Maybe anything BUT party politics?  You wouldn't recognize anything like that since you barred #MerrickGarland from the SCOTUS would you asshat?
Something you’ve never heard of...morals. It’s morals.
#MerrickGarland
How about the fact that head of the CIA and Secretary of State are two totally different jobs?? How can he be qualified for both? And you are the leading obstructionist, so your outrage is a joke

No they caved to your flawed nomination, sad.
You are no leader. You are a divider
Simple FACTS he is fine for Dir CIA but NOT A DIPLOMAT NOT the right person for Sec of State
No surprise. most of you politicians are weasels!  I wish I would find more than five that had ethics and backbone, there's Nunes and 4 more that are honest.
Mitch Time is Up U are either with @POTUS & We The People or U are enabling DemocRat #resistance Elections have consequences GET RID OF FILIBUSTER NOW OR STEP ASIDE SO @SenateGOP can get a REAL LEADER WHO WILL GRAB GAVEL BACK FROM SCHUMER@SenMikeLee @senorrinhatch

Your praise of Trump’s each and every move is horrifying.  No more disagreements from two years ago?  Your entire party’s need to emulate him will end this nation.
But, has been in the Trump @WhiteHouse and can't be trusted anymore! Have you ever, in the history of these US seen so many turnovers in all agencies especially because they were under criminal investigation or doing the investigation (McCabe)? #GOPLOSERS #VOTE2018
No, there's no gun problem in this country, Mitch. Crawl back into your shell.
"Leader". Hahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahha!
Karma Bitch...
Dear Leader; Once again it seems, your unforgivable, RINO posturing makes you totally feckless, and can only continue "Leading" the GOP majority to defeat. You can only offer excuses, as to WHY Dems control. A weakness that will ensure their victory in NOV.
Do something about it.
Different times, different reasons. Peter Principle much?
Great to see Pompeo get the job ! Well done Sir ! MAGA
Why scrape the bottom of the barrel with Pompeo when so many qualified nominees don't bring his baggage.
Looks like another Trump nominee might be in trouble.

Ronny Jackson, who you may remember said Trump only weighed 239lbs (0.o), was afterwards nominated by Trump to head the VA. There were already concerns about his experience, but now this:
Just In: 2 sources confirm to @nancycordes and @edokeefe Sen Vet Affairs Comm is reviewing allegations against Ronny Jackson which include a hostile work environment, excessive drinking on the job and improperly dispensing meds.
hey mitch why you climbing in bed with those little boys
You mean Rand Paul? Oh wait, he's not a democrat, is he? 
Could be that we don't trust any Republican. Can you imagine why? Here's one reason of thousands: Merrick Garland #TheResistance #VoteThemOut #Parkland #AfraidToLead
If the Liar in Chief nominated him then he’s an ass kisser and a danger to the country.
This coming from a man who blocked the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice so you could get a conservative in.  I laugh in your face hypocrite.  Unlike you, we don't forget.

Sir changing your mind on a subject is , is ok. Having some to explain your decision is a huge problem , especially from a liar.
We need nuclear action to confirm him!  Let’s get it done!
You forgot the most important part! He uses his evil, instead of his smart, too often.
You should know, fuckwad.
Build the Wall!
that sounds like the same thing you did with DACA doesn't it big boy. just flip flop all over DC.
Most likely someone got busy n made promises on some bills that will be put forth n help for their district

CBO confirms that 71% of all economic gains from Trump's tax cuts in 2028 will benefit foreigners, and 43% of all economic gains from tax cuts between 2018-2028. https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53772-2017taxacteffectsonincome.pdf … #GOPTaxBill
It could be a senate leader lacking honor and morals, not for america only the republican party, his oath of office is a joke!
Hey Mitch, RINOs love this kind of stuff from Democrats. Face it, you're in the same family, big gov't control first, big spending,never cut a penny DemoRINOs. You're complicit, face it.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @RNC @PressSec No. Pompeo in not fit. Maybe our man child President @realDonaldTrump should have thought hard before firing @RexTillersom #UnfitToLead #UnfitForOffice #UnfitToBePresident #VoteGOPOut #BlueWaveIsComing
#obstruction #enditnow #nuclearoption
Justice is better than politics; foreign affairs confirmation by a flip floppin democrat confirms he makes it political, Justice MaDe it Cia
You need to step down. You are a corrupt enabler.

Ummm...the big flip flop was your GOP boy, Rand Paul.
its not political they just no he is like you a two faced liar ,,,
What was it when you obstructed every single thing the last administration tried to pass?  #HYPOCRITE
Look who’s talking.
Time to go nuclear Mitch! Quit being a puddin!
McConnell, you make it hard for me to be polite to you. You piss on our American Constitution’s separation of powers, you lack integrity, character or any sense of morality or ethics. Your treatment of President Obama reeks of bigotry, ignorance, and no regard for our people.
 You’re absolutely useless, please go hide in your shell, turtle. #mitchmconelturtle
It’s treason. Simple.

#comradeMitch
All?  Like Rand Paul a republican senator from Your state??

(looks through "Following" list, sees zero Democrats)
The answer is.. a liar like you who can’t be trusted about anything.
You did it to a Supreme Court seat shut up.
#RepublicanShitShow
We waited this long let’s just wait until November
What kind of legacy are you leaving your grandchildren by not standing up for moral and ethical action within the @GOP by not leading against a corrupt @POTUS ?
Praying that Robert Mueller has all of you under the radar.






Hypocritical .


@SenateSAA Should arrest OATH BREAKERS!

And a draft dodging POS.
One name, Merrick Garland

Is your wife's family still running drugs and you covering up for them Mitch?



You. Are. A. TRAITOR.

2 Words Merrick Garland.  #MerrickGarland
Choke on your hypocrisy you fucking husk.
Maybe it’s this From @USATODAY “Pompeo built a record of embracing mass surveillance practices, promoting bigotry, championing extreme restrictions on women’s rights, and supporting the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of torture.” BTW, you’re a #dB
You should know, McConnell, you did the same with Obama for 8 years.
You have made the term "politician" synonymous with criminal. No wonder the great majority would fire you all.
#MerrickGarland
LET'S GET RID OF "TURTLE FACE"....A.S.A.P.
Like the Repubs flipped on Garland for the Supreme Court? And the Repubs are flipping for everyone in the FBI? You are an obnoxious obstructionist. Lead by example.  #banassaultweapons

Really Mitch? You’re really gonna play that card? #Assclown
I pray you retire like Paul Ryan.
No flip-flopping. Pompeo is an admitted homophobe wit a narrow world vision. He should not serve in government.
@SenateMajLdr @RandPaul @carlottaclarice @Occupymore 
STOP PUTTING PARTY ( AND CORPORATE INTEREST)OVER COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.
In Obama’s 8 yrs I don’t recall him or his staff EVER needing a lawyer
You control the Senate.  You alone can fix this.  DO YOUR JOB!  Fund the wall and confirn all of Trumps nominations.
Yep, that’s politics, Mitch. You’re leading by example, and the Dems are proving themselves decent learners.
Republicans said, “Trump is unhinged & unfit to hold any office.” Why the change of heart? Politics?
Flip flop your way into resignation. We want this guy! 
Maybe it could be ..... “too busy to take a meeting,” syndrome. Or, politics.
Oh. This too....
This.
#MERRICKGARLAND How soon you forget.
Really? Tell us about the #SCOTUS that YOU STOLE Fukker!
#MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland #MerrickGarland

TERM limits will happen as WE the people Demand it YOU & others r the 1s whom do not desire Term limits YET u work for the people NOT ur self yes u have gotten away with it for decades thats over now. appreciate ur cooperation Signed WE the people of the United States of  America
It could be Republican Rand Paul!
What a hypocrite you are!  You - who wouldn't work with a POTUS because he had black skin.  You are a disgrace.  The country is sick of your partisan rot.
Can’t bring yourself to be gracious.  Say a lot about your soul.
Merrill Garland was nothing but obstructionist politics. Are you senile?
Fuck you  boy
Merick Garland Bitch...

Lets call it Karma!
He is just not in that position.
Most likely your YOUR SLACK JAWED LEADERSHIP.  YOU have failed all Americans...

I can't understand how your wife stays married to you....must be she's overdosing on Chinese herbs.
Considering the Republicans stole a SC seat, I think the Democrats have the right to change their mind about a Republican appointee.
He is a disgrace
Says the architect of obstructionism who withheld hearings & vote for a Supreme Court Justice; obstructed during election the disclosure Russia was meddling in our election; won’t protect #MuellerInvestigation You are a disgrace.
................MAGA.............

DUMP McCONNELL

DUMP TRUMP
It is time to stop having weekends off until all @POTUS appointments are confirmed
You would know their reasoning better than anyone!
You should personally thank Senator Koons of Delaware for his effort to make this a smoother vote by voting "present" which allows you to go ahead with a floor confirmation vote.
@SenateMajLdr ...you just don't get it do you?  IT IS YOU and your SORRY leadership in the SENATE.    GET it?
You won't allow a vote on a bipartisan bill to protect Mueller. What could it be other than dirty politics?
