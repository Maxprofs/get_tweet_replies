#TaxReformScam

Are your taxes going up next year?  If you’re not wealthy or a corporation, you have a 30% chance of paying more taxes next year, higher if you live in a blue state. And your kids will definitely pay much more — the GOP borrowed from them to lower the corporate rate even further.

Paul Ryan just said “we’ve been applying Russian suctions” instead of “sanctions” and this may be the most truthful Freudian slip in history.
tax bill for the trump family
This is great news for me because I am a small business owner. People who aren’t self-employed don’t understand how much we have to pay for and how much we used to have to pay the government in taxes! Thank you President Trump! #MAGA #Trump2020
Please stop lying to the American people. I am still paying taxes on my $725 a month social security. At least until you steal that from the people too. You tried before & you will try again.
Some people need to learn more and read it. To understand the truth.. Pelosi is pissed she has been cut off from your hard work money.
How can small businesses do well people in the community don't have money to buy products?
Hey Paul...Do you think we can see tRump's tax return now?
Propaganda and lies
All of a sudden Speaker Ryan is very talkative. Who is he trying to convince. Mr Ryan, your average American knows this tax cut is benefiting the wealthy and big business. Middle America will be paying more taxes when the smoke settles. That’s why u r running away.

Compensation for rich guys is up! For those of us in the middle and working class not so much. #GOPTaxScam
That's good!  Congratulations!
My personal situation is I get $1.50 a month more!!!!
My friend with a small Biz says she doesn't have as many deductions...soooo
No matter how many times you repeat the lie, it is still a lie. Unless you're a Trump supporter. Then only a single lie has them duped.
You still feel the need to lie even with one foot out the door? At least you can say complicit and consistent.

Try 1.7 trillion
The good news is your retirement.
Great for you all! In the meantime some of us that looked forward to a small refund now OWE, big!!!

Bullshit! Has Donnie Fats made lying an acceptable form of communication?
And how's our democracy as a whole going? We good on election security? Hostile disinformation campaigns? Unanswered questions about what Don jr., Jared, Manafort, Page, Stone, and Cohen were up to during the campaign? Are we all good then?

In honor of tomorrow's #TaxDay, here's a reminder that the #GOPTaxScam has overwhelmingly benefited big corporations and the wealthy — not America's working class. https://bit.ly/2GVbuir

It can never be said enough times by everyone unti the 3 of you are out on your a$$es.

Amazon made $5.6 billion in 2017 and paid no federal income taxes. #TaxDay https://www.seattlepi.com/business/tech/article/Amazon-paid-no-US-income-taxes-for-2017-12713961.php …
BS 

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
Perhaps taxes are not the current priority of the people because we have a president who behaves as if he's in collusion with Russia and you protect him. Shame on you. Your actions have cost you most all of your credibility. And how on earth can you call yourself a patriot?

@HouseGOP @SenateGOP 
The middle class is losing ground under the #GOPTaxBillScam while the big businesses use the windfall to buy back their own stock.  The rich are getting richer and the middle class gets screwed once again.  #GOPTaxScam #GOPComplicit

Thanks to the #GOPTaxScam, wealthy executives are laughing all the way to the bank - while working Americans are stuck holding the bag. A reminder of who comes first in Trump’s Washington. https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/13/how-companies-spend-tax-windfall/505122002/ …
Gas prices are at a 3-year high because oil companies aren’t sharing the benefits of the Republican tax scam. In Ohio people are losing their jobs. Trump, Ryan, McConnell, & the GOP are fraudsters defending a traitor:
Yet we still have a bunch of simple minded fools that are convinced that the tax scam is somehow good for the longterm health of the Middle-class.
Gfy
That is #MAGA
How’s the weather in Moscow?
