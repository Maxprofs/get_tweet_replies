If you give Trump a pass on impeachment  when his proxy discredits or fires Mueller  this president will consider it a pass. Trump is very vulnerable to his lack of self control. This threatens both Republicans and Democrats.
If like you say Catherine " I want the truth", you need to look at the truth.  Get off CNN give Fox a try and look at the truth. #MAGA

Yes Catherine sadly I see you are much more into the climate and not Sen. Stabenow's record on abortion.  Sad
It's very important that we provide a healthy planet for our un murdered children. I guess you do care. #TrumpCrimeFamily doesn't
Our @POTUS cares deeply for America you people just refuse to even try to give him a chance.  Enough said here I think .
The budget deficit is over $730 billion, increasing faster thanks to the temporary tax breaks. The numbers don't lie Mitch. http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
I haven't received a raise, a bonus or a noticeable change in my take home pay. Things are great.
Not for March.  Also wages are flat and disparities between wealthy and everyone else has never been greater.  Nice outcome if you're a kleptocrat.
It's all crashing down soon when you and Ryan shove this spending bill nobody gets to see down our throats.

You are not American at all.

What kind of man are you?

You are our enemy sir.

Enemy
220 Billion $ to CEOs, profitable corporations, and share holders - The Uber Rich received WELFARE FOR WEALTHIEST! The rest of us 99 percent didn't get permanent tax cuts. November coming!
That’s not what the article says... it does not give credit to tax reform. Reality is if you know anything about economics is that results trails economic levers being applied.  In other words nothing that’s been done in the last 2 months influenced sentiment.  Stop the BS
My husband and I are still waiting to see a difference in our paychecks!! I'm sure you've noticed a PERMANENT increase...hmmm??
Hahahaha lying hypetcrit
I’m sure it’s only a temporary setback. You’ll have the economy tanking in no time. #TermLimits
Are you out of you mind?  Obviously you are not listening to the American People who pay your salary - only the rich free loaders living off our tax dollars

BREAKING: American Nazi wins Republican primary in Illinois' Third Congressional District.

No, really. A real American right wing, white suprema…
CONGRATULATIONS
Thanks to PRESIDENT OBAMA, who’s coat tails you’re still riding on! You’re trying to discredit PRESIDENT OBAMA, but those of us that actually THINK know what you’re doing. You’re a part of the old white supremacist group that’s dying out. The sooner youre out of office the better
It’ll hit an all time high when you are no longer there!!!!
You are betraying your country and shaming your office by allowing Donald Trump to continue his alarming behavior unchecked.  Trump is clearly compromised by Putin and endangering our national security. Meanwhile you do nothing! You are weak and corrupt. History will be harsh.
We have NO confidence in you- Mitch!!

Tax reform is not finished
REPEAL FATCA & implement TTFI in @RepHolding bill

Yeah, well that upswing started under Obama...don t take the credit..he did the hard work, now yu guys opened the coffers to the 1% AGAIN...just like in GW Days...econo trouble will follow...and dems will clean it up...AGAIN.
People are taking second jobs to afford skyrocketing healthcare costs. I'm one of them. I'm conservative and live in a Red area. People are growing pissed understanding how much they've been duped.
Pass @ChrisCoons bill to protect Special Counsel. Today.
The gop is constantly playing this card.  I’ve never seen this in other administrations where one topic is constantly touted day in and day out by the entire admin.  They must send out an email ea evening telling you what you must talk about!!
Thanks Obama for bringing America back from a near depression - with no help from you!
I don’t know why you’re smiling. There’s not one positive comment to your tweet. Are you getting the picture? You’re gone come November!!!

DO. SOMETHING. OR. RESIGN. No one with a brain is falling for your tax break scam for the rich 1%. YOU created this mess...you and Paul Ryan
McConnell headed towards his own Armageddon soon.

Yes we are all confident that republicans will go down in November !!!
, and voting Democrat.
GOP soft on #defense to bankrupt country with 1.5 trillion debt.
@KYHouseGOP soft on #defense too
"...we know where the tax cut is really going. Surprise! It’s paying for stock repurchases by corporations, as Corporate America despairs of investing in much other than dividing the pie provided by near-record profitability into fewer and larger pieces."
Mitch remember this
Short-term tax cuts inflated the deficit in an attempt to buy votes  for  the November 2018 elections. The long-term tax cuts went to the wealthy  and to corporations who largely used it to buy back stock. Some got a  bonus, but bonuses are TEMPORARY. It did not go to pay rises.

Trump’s legal problems with women just got much worse http://bit.ly/2FOP3PA  
We have confidence in what Trump has done to help America.  That's where the confidence comes from.  People are not afraid anymore that an Obama dictator is making us an Islamic America.  Now we just need you & Ryan to support his platform & stop obstructing it.
You should be afraid, very afraid.
KochSucker!
With this budget you're about to pass, you are a liar and traitor.
You're still funding Obamacare but not a penny for the wall. 
Say goodbye to the GOP.

Cowards, deep state, treasonous, fifth column.   How disappointing to have a GOP majority & have these voting democrat.
What are you doing about preventing foreign adversaries and nefarious agents from interfering with the midterm elections in 2018?  Obama helped established and sustained the economic recovery despite your obstruction for 8  years.


Where the hell is this happening?? I want to go there because you damn people in Congress and trump haven't done me any good. So where is this, give me the locations
I agree. It's not Armageddon. This ass-hole is fixing to get burned bigly and you're going to get caught up in the shit. Your gutless just like he's is. You've long lost the ability to do the right thing. Good thing is most Americans haven't lost that ability.
And yet...confidence in our government is at an all time low....Thanks #Russia
You have bet your party on a DOLT. You'll go down on the worst Sen Maj Ldr in history
Trump ignored warnings from his national security advisers when he congratulated Putin, including a section in his briefing materials in all-capital letters stating "DO NOT CONGRATULATE." http://wapo.st/2HMSWks 
You're a traitor to the country that gave you everything!
"DO NOT CONGRATULATE," national security advisers wrote in Trump's written briefing ahead of call with Vladimir Putin. Trump congratulated. The notes said to condemn the attack of an ex-Russian spy in London with a nerve agent. He did not. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-national-security-advisers-warned-him-not-to-congratulate-putin-he-did-it-anyway/2018/03/20/22738ebc-2c68-11e8-8ad6-fbc50284fce8_story.html?utm_term=.bb3fb8be6dc8 …
Flooding
Flooding is a form of behavior therapy used to treat people with fears or phobias. In flooding, the person with the fears is exposed to the thing that frightens them for a sustained period of time.
The idea behind it is that, by exposing you to your fear, you will eventually see it as less fear-producing. For example, a therapist may take a person who is afraid of dogs into a kennel to expose them to a large number of dogs in a controlled situation.
The Republican party constant noise about tax reform is obnoxious.
I have zero confidence in the GOP. Anyone who supports and or defends Trump is a traitor.
NRA pushed Congress in 1995 to stop the CDC from spending taxpayer $ on research that advocated gun control. Congress then passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996 and cut funding that effectively ended the CDC study of gun violence as a public health issue.
Has "Leader" McConnell joined Dennison-Trump today in congratulating Vladimir Putin on his hard fought election victory?
Go take care of your hidden China deals #Traitor #RINO and move out of the way!
And layoffs

The Austin package bomber now strikes for a fifth time—the latest at a FedEx facility. Meanwhile there’s a shooting at Great Mills High School in Maryland. Our nation is in the throes of domestic terror and gun violence while our Congress fails to act and our President is insane.

Because of Obama.
Thank you Obama despite all your obstructionism
Thank you Obama
And deficits are back to $1+ trillion  year because of all the W-2 changes caused by tax reform.
Turtle, what is your porpoise? Awful, spineless bag of dust.
We’ll see ,”Uncle Mitchy,” we’ll see.
You sold us out to the Chinese. You need jail time.
Armageddon occurring in Oval Office.
Dream on.  No one got more money, it is winter and nothing to do but shop.  You r so out of the loop you are in your own orbit.  No one believes or trusts you. U r one of the most hated people in america.  What have you done to protect r democracy. Nothing under your bed.
Don’t believe everything you read. Americans will let you know!
Would like to see tweets about the ‘elephant in the room’. Let’s hear why you stopped Russian hacks from going public before the election & why no push back on Trump’s Russian coddling. Kentuckians want to know where you stand. Speak up please, before....
ok and all the layoffs at toy-r-us , kmart, sears,macys, gas going up, people losing their health care, the lists goes on and on all for tax breaks for your rich buddies ... f-you
Whenever Mitch feels the need to crank out his propaganda it must be a bad news day for POTUS.
That has EVERYTHING to do with eight years of Obama Admin policy, and NOTHING to do with the #GOPTaxScam.  As they always do, your numbers are coming and they'll be as bad as Bush/Cheney's 2008 economic meltdown.  Unless...we #ThrowThemOut. #TrumpColluded GOP=DEATH
Yawn....wake me when you move on to current issues facing this country.

Anarchists are exploding bombs across the south and an embattled republican president is fending off a growing number of women including a porn star and you're boasting about @BarackObama's economy? Please!

#WhyVoteRepublican #VoteBlue #Enough @GOP @RNC
American’s confidence in the President and leaders of the Republican Party is not at rock bottom. You are allowing the slow destruction of our democracy.  The Republicans have turned on their constituents and are now actively working to harm as many as possible!

Economic Armageddon will be coming upon expiration of tax policy. It is on the hands of republicans. Dems will take back money you lined your pocket with
Killing kids left and right, a vile President and permanent tax cuts for the rich and crumbs for the middle class are not a winning platform.

Keep trying Mitch
Thank you Obama
Oh Mumbles, aka turtle man...You . Are. Pathetic.
This is the good news coming -

My town is dying. Hospital and grocery store closing. All kinds of companies like Toys R Us going under. How is all this good, again?
Keep up the good work.

Well, when the president's campaign hired Cambridge Analytics, and the pres attacks the special prosecutor, and when the whitehouse is in chaos, and the GOP ignores it, and we're supposed to cheer at a $1.50 per week while the Kochs get $1billion- close enough.
