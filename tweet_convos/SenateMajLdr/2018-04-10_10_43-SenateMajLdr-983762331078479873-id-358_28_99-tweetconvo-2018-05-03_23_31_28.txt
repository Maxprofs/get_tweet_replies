Your refusal to enact protection of the Mueller investigation is irresponsible.  You're creating a crisis.  You're an accomplice to Trump's crimes.  #RESIGN
I’m ecstatic that this is your final term because you won’t be re-elected. Matter of fact, you are about to be in the minority. #BlueWave2018

Please remember that and get out the GOP voters in November @USAGSessions @IngrahamAngle @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @VP @JudgeJeanine @SpeakerRyan
Hey, just heard Ryan’s packing his bags for bigger pastures. Care to make it a twofer? You guys could ride off into the sunset TOGETHER. It would make a great picture. Think about it. Btw, thanks for that democrat spending bill! LOVED that!
Are you part of the Russian attack too? That would explain why you won’t move forward with a vote to protect Mueller.
We are not fascists. We are a democracy governed by the rule of law and separation of powers. Do not let Trump divide us any further than he already has or degrade our nation any more. Enough.
Last I looked, America is a republic.  Another example of liberals changing the truth.
Here you go dickhole:

We are not fascists. We are a republic governed by the rule of law and separation of powers. Do not let Trump divide us any further than he already has or degrade our nation any more. Enough.
You won't be serving anyone come election time, unless you and @SpeakerRyan and the @GOP start supporting the president and ending this #WitchHunt . Civil unrest is brewing and it's not going to be pretty.
It’s not going to be pretty for you brother #resist
Sorry West Coast, you must have thought #resist is going to go in your favor, if and when it comes down to actually fighting for America. Pink Hats won't be able to stop the #MAGA, anymore than they have stopped us now. But enjoy your dream Brother
Millions more of us brother.
Mitch  Your name will go down in history as a coward and fool and be forever linked to Donald Trump.
Mr. McConnell, Protect Mueller. - America

1. Tax bill will cost what the CBO warned. 
2. We knew that before the vote. 
3. Republicans rushed the vote despite it. 
4. Republicans can't be trusted to govern. https://twitter.com/NivElis/status/984087995233062919 …
Leader Jackass are you now going to rip food from the hands of children and seniors or just beat the middle class again to cover your gift to the rich (including yourself)?
Support Our POTUS DJT
Confirm His Nominees to Fill Our Govt/Depts/Agencies
Stop the Nonsense that is Taking Place in The Senate That You Control !!
Wake up
Would be nice to see you do at least one thing to earn your fat paycheck.  You need to retire.
So everyone in Kentucky is getting a NEW CAR!
Who is going to pay back the $2000 BILLION? Anyone can borrow huge amounts of money and say” look how happy we are”. Who’s paying that money back with massive interest you God damned thief!
You have the ability to lead @GOP to do what’s right and protect our constitution, our nation. Why won’t you?
Get out - - Ryan saw the writing on the wall.  Now, you evil man, get out!

@SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley @SenThomTillis @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader

McConnell refuses to allow vote on bill to protect Mueller http://hill.cm/seBdIhz  
Stealing a lifetime SCOTUS seat & enriching yourself & #Trump with your fraudulent #GOPTaxScam didn’t help secure our elections, #MitchMcConnell.

#PartyOfTreason

Now he is blocking a vote to protect Mueller.
Mueller is an unethical man and needs to be gone.
Does it hurt when the breitbart comes back out like that?
Show me one unethical thing he has done. How about we compare the lives and deeds of trump vs mueller and then re-examine that statement? Thinking is your friend, try to do it some.
The greed in your #TaxScam, along with the #IncomeReductionZones you and your cronies have created will further increase poverty, especially among the poor and people of color...intentionally.
Politics of systemic racism is intertwined with the politics of suppressing the poor #PoorPeoplesCampaign #UniteThePoor

#GOPTaxScam enabling greed and racism.

#UnfitForOffice
How the hell is letting me keep more of my own money racist?  There is nothing in the bill that mentions race.  If you're jealous then stop being a victim, take personal responsibility for your life, and work harder so you can be rich like me.
Hi John,
It's not about you and I'm not envious of your money. If you think you are more deserving than those who have been systematically kept in lower income opportunities then I question your ability to be discerning, let alone caring of poverty. That is not enviable at all.
Excited? No, that's not the right word. Delusional would be more appropriate.
Piece of garbage, protect Mueller, protect rule of law, do your job
Please stop whatever you are doing and get the reckless egomaniac @realDonaldTrump out of office before he gets us all killed.
Do the right thing. #ProtectMuellerNOW
We are watching you! When this investigation blows up, America will be at your front door looking for justice!!!

You better put a huge effort in standing with OUR ELECTED @POTUS. Seriously, the Republican Party has been despicable & with elections coming, no one may show up and all you haters will only yourselves to blame. Not TRUMP, Yourselves.
Your wrong alot dude. Like you don't think Trump will fire Mueller. Like anyone on earth can predict Trump. More abysmal judgement on you part. How you remain speaker is incredulous.

#BlueWaveIsComing2018
BREAKING: @loriberman has won the special election in SD31 for the Florida Senate. Congratulations, Lori! 
You won't escape this shit storm, Mr. McConnell

The Law Is Coming, Mr. Trump
Protect Robert Mueller
Absolutely no thanks to you , how many years have you been in Washington ? ( Too many) and what has changed to make this happen ?
This is your president-
If this is all just a big witch hunt, why does Trump care so much about preserving attorney-client privilege in the first place? https://nyti.ms/2v61RMy 
I hope you get throat punched one day
A brighter future for US is one without you.  #NoGOPutin
McConnell is as popular as walking in shit barefoot. I went through the responses to your lies and found no support for turtle boy. 

TIP; If you're looking for an opportunity zone it's not in Kentucky.
TRAITOR TO THE USA
McConnell refuses to allow vote on bill to protect Mueller http://hill.cm/seBdIhz  
Opportunity to work for nothing. The Mitch McConnell dream.

Other states heavily reliant on federal assistance include Louisiana(40.1 percent), Tennessee (39.9 percent), Montana (39.1 percent), and Kentucky (38.5 percent).Jan 11, 2017.

Cecil turtle is on the take.
@SpeakerRyan     #MitchMcConell and #PaulRyan now have two simple choices:- (1) Support #America #Democracy, our way of life and #Mueller OR (2) Support #Trump, #Russia and #Putin. BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY -DO THE RIGHT THING !   https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/983846274331004928?s=19 …
Do something to protect Mueller turtle man!

#ProtectMueller
You absolutely need to allow a vote on protecting Mueller. To not even ALLOW A VOTE is the least democractic thing you can do. Don’t disgrace our great nation.
Isn't it time you supported the president.  Your ethics are long gone and you should resign
You can't be naive enough, or so "Party over County", to trust Trump not to take action against Mr Mueller, Mr Sessions, or Mr Rosenstein. He obviously is considering taking that step, and is being counseled to do so by his closest advisors on Fox. 1/
He spoke freely of considering firing Mr Mueller during the last Cabinet Meeting. Please do your duty and protect the investigation into Russian interference in our elections, and our Democracy. #ProtectMueller
BOT
Can you do an interview on INFOWARS? Man think out of your square Box live a little!!!
I’m sure u have lots of friends
Why isn't lying Zetterberg under oath...anti free speech.
It’s time to protect the special counsel... innocent men don’t act guilty.... everything will come out in the end Mitch. Be on the right side of history
Our nation will have a brighter future if you passed legislation to protect the Mueller investigation.
McConnell, time for you to man up and protect Mueller!Everyone I know has such a totally low opinion of You. I have to ask" did you take money from Russia" is this why you are afraid of Trump! Stand up for America and what is right! Put your country  first! Be an American!!!?
You refuse to do anything to protect Mueller and you're complicit. What are you hiding? You're all a bunch of grifters. Your time will come.
Is anyone surprised? Just look at this corrupt adminstration. Count the number of Republicans who have quit or are walking away. Republicans are scum.
Why are you protecting Trump as he continues to attack our democracy?  If he fires Mueller, you will go down in history as a coward.

Interesting how you're completely avoiding the big elephant turd in the room. Yes, that would be the Trump Dump.
#ProtectMueller
Stop talking, we don’t believe a word you say!!
Traitor
Hey future senate minority leader, #ProtectMuellerNOW
I wish he were up for re-election this year. I'd give just about anything to see both him and Ryan go down.
Jesus, do you have Alzheimer's, all you ever talk about is the tax cut. Let me tell you something you senile old fu*k, you and your friends may have gottin richer, but me and my friends got nothing. So screw off.
Looking forward to helping vote you out in 2020. I'm doing what I can to make sure Dems will take the Senate before then, though. 
WHERE. ARE. YOUR. BALLS???

Stop Donald Trump now.
The only way @SenateMajLdr can elevate his home state of #Kentucky is to drag down the rest of the country.

When it's over, when the United States that you and I knew is dead, this guy -- this this dirty rotten son of a bitch right here -- will be the one most responsible. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/983846105594187776 …
Tax reform? No asshole it isn’t. I paid more than I have in years, and it’s was my first year of retirement!

#ProtectMueller Do the right thing Senator.

There is no indication that Trump will fire Mueller except:

1. That time he ordered the White House counsel to fire Mueller…
Your silence on the Perp In Chief is deafening. Where is your moral integrity? Shameful!
That's why 254 replies beg to differ with you assessment
PS, you & Ryan have lost all respect I had for your leadership positions where I can now say YOU ARE BOUGHT COWARDS!
Senator, as a constituent, I expect you and Congress to #protectMueller from firing. History is watching and so are we.
As one of your last acts as majority leader maybe you should protect the rule of law & protect Special Council Mueller? Maybe Mueller should bring YOU in for questioning on obstruction of justice if not!

Your state is the poorest in the US. Why do people keep voting for you? And why won’t you pass legislation to protect Robert Mueller?????
To be fair, it's in the top 5. Mississippi is top.
TRAITOR. DO YOUR JOB AMD PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY.
STOP protecting Trump ! If he is innocent what are you protecting him from ? He isn't. You know it.

Why won't you PROTECT MUELLER ? Alterior motives ? 
Makes you ALL look guilty. 
NOVEMBER is coming. 
The GOP is going. 
Get to high ground boys..
Big #BlueWave2018 coming.
Why aren’t you protecting democracy? No one is above the law, you got your tax cuts now do something
You KNOW Trump is talking about firing Mueller and/or Rosenstein to stop the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russian election interference. This would be a clear obstruction of justice. WHY ARE YOU REFUSING TO PROTECT MUELLER? #TraitorMcConnell #ProtectMueller
You mean the taxscam that gave billions to the 1% with no strings attached? The scam that gave a time limited pittance to the poor and middle class AND a HUGE deficit to pay back over the next decades? That scam?
Protect Marine veteran mueller from the draft dodger.
FU Mitch you obstructionist POS hope you rot in hell traitor
Why are you refusing to allow a vote to protect Mueller? You are a disgrace! You stole President Obama's SCOTUS appointee-and you boast that you are proud of it. Mueller is going to indict you too for crimes against the USA.

Here, for ease of viewing and forwarding, is the TV ad that Republican for the Rule of Law will be airing on Fox and Friends and Morning Joe in DC tomorrow morning.
https://youtu.be/e0AUus59QhE 
Mueller must be allowed to continue his investigation into Russian interference in our democracy. The Senate needs to step up to this moment and put the bipartisan bills to protect his investigation on the floor now for a vote.
Why are you refusing to protect Mueller? You refuse to bring it to the floor. What do you have to hide? We're watching you.
#ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller
What are you doing to support President Trump? What are you doing about new tough immigration laws? If you cannot to your job - step down. You are going to cost Republicans their majority by your inaction!

Screw you
You are a failure. Grow a set and pass a law prohibiting the idiot-in-chief from firing Mueller. Otherwise you are complicit in the idiot's obstruction and illegal activities. YOU WILL GO DOWN
We will flood the streets. You will be remembered throughout history as a coward. So do the right thing.
4/ The to-do list is short, and simple.

- Act like you're the leaders of a COEQUAL branch of government.…
What a complete and utter POS you are @SenateMajLdr, but we knew that before this destructive, un-America administration.
Which Kentuckians do you serve exactly?
You cannot outrun your betrayal of America. You will pay dearly. 
You refuse to protect Mueller? 
#TreasonousTraitors 
@GOP @SenateGOP  
#TrumputinistTyrants
Guilty?You will deserve every. single. indignity. as justice finds you.
#AmericansWillOvercomeRepublicanBetrayal
Since you obviously can’t protect Mueller.. coming
McConnell refuses to allow vote on bill to protect Mueller http://hill.cm/seBdIhz  
You know, for the first time I think you might actually might be facing jail.
#ProtectMuellerNOW
Hey asshole, yeah, you are one but we all know it.  Anyways, what does Putin have on you?  Blocking a vote to protect Mueller is the act of one who has a boneyard in their closet.
Pay attention!
Irony of 2018: 

Republicans are hesitant to fulfill big legislative promises like the wall, school choice, cutting spending, and Obamacare repeal because they…
#treasonturtle
What the hell is wrong with you?!  Why not protect mueller with a bill! You’re traitor!  Why? Who is threatening you?
Mitch. You are an unmitigated failure and a disgrace to this country. History will not be kind to your name for generations to come.

You disgust anyone with a brain in their head.
You’re both so embarrassing it hurts

You’ve lost your way, and Governor DingDong never had a moral compass to begin with
lying pos!! does not help anyone, but the very rich!
Start supporting our President !!!
Come out, come out wherever you are!
You can't even imagine the shit show that's going to come down on you and your GOP buddies if Trump fires anyone investigating him. I don't think you comprehend how many angry people are going to show up on the steps of the Capital and they aren't going to leave. Buckle up.
Do y'all remember that time Obama cheated on his 3rd wife with a porn star?

Or that time he bragged about sexual assault?

Or that time he was investigated by the FBI & tried to fire Special Counsel?

Remember that time Obama attacked Gold Star families? 

Yeah, me neither.
GOP plan:
1 Pass tax reform favoring the rich & raising taxes for all others, knowing deficit will grow exponentially.
2 Feign horror at rising deficit. 
3 Propose balanced budget amendment.  
4 Propose cuts to welfare programs, SS and medicare.
5 Laugh all the way to the bank.
You will be the one that will be responsible!
Let’s understand “Marshal Law”  California was important in the decision about allowing it to exist; https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Martial+Law  
Why do the people of Ky keep electing pervet & criminal @SenateMajLdr? Mitch doesnt have the luxury of fighting for his voters because he’s owned by every Tom Dick and Harry special interest lobbyist in the country. Just wait until  Mueller exposes Mcconnell’s crimes.
Gerrymandering
YOU see no indication that Trump is going to fire Mueller? Are you blind as well as deaf?
Angry over reports in December of subpoenas related to his business dealings, President Trump told advisers that Robert Mueller's investigation had to be shut down
https://nyti.ms/2GLpiQC 
PROTECT MUELLER. For the love of GOD, put country before Party!! History will judge you!!!! #ProtectMueller
Sen. McConnell, you have said you won’t introduce a bill to protect Mueller’s job because you haven’t seen “clear indication” this is a concern.  The news today is there’s a SECOND time Trump had to be convinced not to fire him.  Your stall game is devious and despicable. Shame.
What are you doing to prevent Trump from firing special counsel Robert Mueller?
Must read.  Please.
YOURE A TRAITOR IF YOU DONT STOP TRUMP! How much more can USA stand?  Stop the insanity! Are you not worried about November elections? Or do you know something we don’t?
Americans will march on your home residence if Trump impedes this Investigation!!!!!!! #ProtectMuellerNOW #ProtectRosenstein Stop being a complicit immoral buffoon
WTF are you doing about Trump? Are you going to let him fire Mueller? Get your house in order Turtle! Stop being a coward. You know your days in Congress are already numbered at your age. Just do something for the love of God.
#ProtectMueller
Fund the wall, end Sanctuary cities, pass Kate's law, confirm Trump's nominations! You are the worst leader in history!
Protect Muller!!!  #GOPTraitors #PutinsPuppet
Gee, you seem to elicit more bile than praise.  Have you been a bad boy again Mitchell?
we are voting you out and every last corrupt @GOP
You are just as much as a crook as Trump by looking the other way.
We need a bill to protect the special counsel now!! #RussiaGate #MuellerIsComingForYou Do it now or the senate flips democrat and you’re out of a job soon!
McConnell, if trump fires mueller or Rosenstein, it is on you to get a spine and protect this country.  Or are you a Russian pawn too.
Since you can't lead....get out of the damn way....you fool.
I guess you’re following the Kansas model that damn near bankrupted that state & caused cuts to services across the state.  U r the definition of insanity-keep cutting taxes 4 the rich & it will create jobs & prosperity.  This BS will NEVER work!
Your constituents don't seems happy Mitch...
Protect Mueller
Thanks to your wonderful tax reform my wife just received a whopping $12 per week raise. That will certainly help with the high energy cost we have. No my state didn't reduce electric rates in fact they are going up


Here at @crookedmedia, we spend a lot of time attacking Paul Ryan, which he absolutely deserves. 

But let’s not forget how awful @SenateMajLdr is:…
