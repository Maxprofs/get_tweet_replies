Your corporate masters and the Koch bros are well pleased with their minion. You make a good lap dog.
179% tariff put on Sorghum by the Chinese due to your party’s policies.

Kansas is tired of your Trumpian “winning.”
Rich get richer...

Rest of us pay Trillion Dollar Ryans debt.
Senator Roberts, please contact Gov Colyer and encourage him to pass those tax savings along to the citizens of Kansas!  KS Senate did its work, also call on the KS House to pass the tax savings on to the hard working tax payers of Kansas. You will be a hero.
You think the yam should release his now?
And sends the bill to our grandchildren. That’s not leadership, Senator.
My last year of refunds.  They were fun for 40 years but Sen Pat has friends he owes favors to.  But Sen Pat did screw our first responders pretty hard, so I feel sorrier for them.

Amazon made $5.6 billion in 2017 and paid no federal income taxes. #TaxDay https://www.seattlepi.com/business/tech/article/Amazon-paid-no-US-income-taxes-for-2017-12713961.php …
Pat, could you be anymore full of it?
YOU are outdated and burdensome.

Not if you’re a truck driver.  My husband and other Frito Lay drivers from Topeka found out they will be getting much less deductions next year.

helps only the rich
Lol Kansas just had to raise taxes because of how irresponsible Republicans were in cutting taxes and the public sector. What school of economics is it that teaches to destroy the economy so few rich people can extract  all wealth?
What it really does is grease the skids for sleazy bastards like yourself. #ImpeachTrump
Thou shalt not lie.
No, Pat. #PantsOnFire
BARS OF GOLD, JETS,  LIMOUSINES AND ELABORATE VACATIONS  FOR THE RICH AND POWERFUL  
CUTS TO SS, MEDICARE/ MEDICAID AND HEARSES FOR THE POOR, SICK AND POWERLESS.
"Rs" ARE SO, VERY, SELFISH, GREEDY AND HEARTLESS
WE WANT, FOR ALL, THE SAME MEDICAL COVERAGE THAT CONGESS HAS! NOW
Creates a deficit of 105% of GDP by 2028!

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
China Imposes 179 Percent Tariff On U.S. Sorghum

Seed and chemicals already purchased for Fall '18 crop. 

Thanks, Trump.

Stormy Daniels reacts to Pres. Trump's denial he knew anything about $130,000 payment made to her: "I work in the adult business and I'm a better actor than he is." http://abcn.ws/2CcjBVI  

Now secure that boarder
But will escalate the national debt that you fought against the last 10 years #hypocrite

We still foaming at the mouth for @POTUS 

What about you @imwithmary (you never respond unless it suits your far right agenda)
Liar
If I was as rich as you I’d feel the same . Instead I’ll use my $1.50 to contribute to the @DNC

And still will take as much data and data entry to get it done. Only dumbasses would think different.
Keep telling that lie, if it makes you feel better. Pat. Your constituents know better.
And raises the country's deficit to an unrecoverable amount.
Not me, sir. I now have zero deductions. Thanks so much!
will we get to see your leaders tax returns or will you still stick for the CON MAN?
You are apparently "reality challenged" at best. A liar and shill for the Kochs and Mercer's at worst. In either case enjoy it now...
Tell us how tax cuts at the state level in Kansas are working out for it's students & public employees?

"The smaller tax incentive is expected to have a negative impact both for a taxpayer’s ability to deduct charitable gifts and for the amount of gifts charitable organizations expect to receive." http://blog.williamsparker.com/businessandtax/2018/03/06/charitable-giving-under-new-tax-act/ …
Yes the day the wealthiest Americans and corporation receive a tax break off the backs of the poor. That is something the GOP will own. So much for being fiscal conservatives who increased the national debt by over a trillion dollars
#TaxCutsandJobsAct I’m sure will benefit you as you scam your followers out of millions. Con artist on tv said he targets evangelicals; because if they’ll believe that BS they’ll believe anything.
#Fraud #GopTaxScam
Rich get richer tax plan is on its way in. Middle and lower class lose multiple much needed tax deductions while businesses gain many more. Republicans have sold out their supporters in favor of their donors.
Ahhhh, Kansas. 

Where Trickle Down economics works. 

Right??
Wow, that’s the exact same tweet McConnell posted about an hour ago. And Paul Ryan. Creepy! #breadcrumbs
Perhaps this would be a good time for Trump to release his 2017 tax returns - surly they are not already being audited
especially the Koch family
I guess if I am a millionaire or a large corporation that is accurate. #TaxScam

New from @SenateDems  Under #TrumpTax in 2018 alone, major corporations have authorized more than $250 BILLION in stock buybacks benefitting wealthy shareholders & executives – instead of raising wages for American workers. https://twitter.com/senatedems/status/985907323750117376 …
Trump's new tax code, that YOU voted for, added 1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. How stupid are you? 
This time next year, many families will have an unexpected tax bill.  You going to be around to help explain what a "relief" the new system is?
In Pat’s world: No one pays taxes. We drive on toll roads, I guess corporate sponsors build his dream wall, everybody is home schooled, our air & water are toxic because there are no “job killing” regulations to enforce and if your house catches fire, it’s “bucket brigade” time!
