The Republican Party is owned & operated by the Russian mob, & are protecting fraudster Trump, ransacking America & destroying US democracy for their own self-enrichment:

I look forward to the day you are held accountable for enabling Trump's war on the rule of a law.

Also for stealing Merrick Garland's seat.

#TraitorMcConnell
#MerrickGarland
I will always remember you as the person who did nothing about this, who failed to uphold his duty to this country, who brought rot and disease and allowed it to metastasize at the highest levels.
Kentucky is falling apart on your watch Mr. "Decider." You've let your people down in the name of greed
.@SenateMajLdr Do you smuggle cocaine in your evil turtle shell or is that business strictly run by your wife's family?
I hope KY votes you out in November.

I look forward to the day you are gone.
Sure you are you incompetent turtle.
Did you really take $3,5000,000.00 from an Oligarch connected to Putin?
You have repeatedly failed your constituents. You are senator to one of the poorest counties in the country. You don't give a damn about them. You've screwed the people enough. You need to resign. You will be booted out in 2022 and also be neutered in November.

To the good folks of Kentucky...it’s time to ditch Mitch. Vote for anybody but Mitch, he does not care about us. He prefers his donors, the rich and corporate interests.

You better protect Robert Mueller. We're all watching.
How come the GOP is incapable of finding qualified people ? This is an embarrassment .
Of course he has no qualifications for the position.#DitchMcConnell
We need #GunReformNow
Mitch, resign so you can spend more time with your grandchildren

I am deeply troubled by the attacks on the Russia investigation and the calls to fire Robert Mueller. Congress cannot wait any longer to pass legislation to protect the special counsel.
Good choice. We’re reminded POTUS is not a veteran, whose “affairs” are headed to the courts. 

#Mitchontherun
@realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP 
Ugave both nephews 70% disability from Iraq. 1 a sniper other never left motor pool. Why have you denied my Vietnam Vet brother 100% disability? 2 tours, MIA 2x, alcoholism, PTSD, Agent Orange lesions, etc Waiting for him to die I suspect.

The #GOP continues to parade completely unqualified candidates. What a joke!
Get the nominees approved McConnell! This is ridiculous & you are allowing it!
Retire

Do your job and protect our democracy #DemandAVote
So you’re for Medicaid expansion?
completely unqualified.  i have flown an airplane.  does that make me qualified to run and airline?
Lying hypetcrit Mitch the obstructionist
Trump’s corruption deserves to be a central issue in the 2018 midterms  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/1/17056562/trump-corruption-midterms?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter … via @voxdotcom
You are a Vichy puppet. You don't hold yourself accountable. If you were more honest, you would not have blocked the nomination of Merrick Garland. So screw you.
Your wife sucky , fucky long time? Is she good at sucking as you! Please let me know! Thank u
#ProtectMueller
Please retire. Go home.

Mitch McConnell is a useless lair who needs to be put into his place. Help elect @AP4Liberty in MO and @NickForVA in VA.

Mike Pompeo never fought in the Gulf War, even though he says he did.
Still want to vote for him?

McConnell says he doesn't have the ability to muster enough votes from the GOP to get nominee Pompeo a favorable Committee vote. He says it's an example of confirmation issues caused by Democrats.
Holy Reaping What You Sowed Remember Merrick Garland You Lying…

Every asylum applicant should be given a choice: Stay in detention for the entire duration of your case or wait in Mexico for a decision.

"McConnell kicked a puppy & dipped his withered old man balls in the fondue pot-God knows what else in his ongoing quest to become the most disliked man On earth. To that end-he says he's denying bill protecting #Mueller on the floor-TAKE THAT DEMOCRACY!"

Is there any politician in Washington that has the courage and leadership of an Abraham Lincoln that can put and end to the Democrat Party’s sham called The Mueller Investigation. It is sad to see our country held hostage by a political party. Keep Senate in session nonstop.
You are impotent!! And, you have no chin. NO CHIN=NO POWER!
Must dispose of the filibuster and get the rest of POTUS nominations to a vote NOW
Dr. Jackson is a phenomenal choice and will do great things for the Veterans of our nation!
Retire
Kyle Duncan cannot fairly represent all Americans. Thread >
The Senate may soon vote on the nomination of Kyle Duncan for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench. This man has spent much of his career advocating against LGBTQ rights, women’s rights, immigrants’ rights, and voting rights.

Why? He’s an alcoholic and the WH staff calls him the “candy man” handing out Ambien and Provigil. Where’s all that missing Percocet?? Another qualified Trump nominee!!! 
Yeah, so how's this looking for you now, Mitch?
this certainly has aged well 
Another poor appointee by Trump. He has no experience in leading such a massive department.  If you care for vets stop this now.
You’ll Sign on for anything! Conflict when wife works for prez.  Smh 
How come VAMC medical facilities are scrutinized more than private facilities and religious ones? People wait for hours after their appt has passed. At the @CincinnatiVamc, I wait no longer than 15 minutes. Your exaggerated BS is to destroy the best healthcare in the country! #FU
Dr. Jackson is not qualified to lead the @DeptVetAffairs. He lied about Trump's weight and mental faculties after handing him a chart and asking what animals were on it. Could have done that at Denny's or Waffle House not @WhiteHouse! Ignorance is bliss! Minority soon! #VOTE2018
Why lie?

Great job!
Just In: 2 sources confirm to @nancycordes and @edokeefe Sen Vet Affairs Comm is reviewing allegations against Ronny Jackson which include a hostile work environment, excessive drinking on the job and improperly dispensing meds.
How about working on Judges and filling open spots?! Pathetic
Not a single word on the Waffle House shooting!  Is that because the victims were people of color & the shooter a crazy white man affiliated with white supremacy groups?  Hey but you keep being you!  It will help us retake Congress in November #BlueWaveComing2018 #BlueWaveRising
Really Mitch? No experiencing in administration or leadership. You are setting Jackson & VA up for failure so you can push for privatization. Vote out @GOP in November.
Do your job & #ConfirmGrenell!
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel will be visiting the White House later this week to meet w/@realDonaldTrump. The Senate should confirm @RichardGrenell as U.S. Ambassador to Germany now PRIOR to this important meeting!

#ProtectMueller

I look forward to YOU being prosecuted for obstructing Justice!
You are the most hateful power hungry man. It’s disgraceful you won’t even bring the Protect Mueller bill to the senate floor. You will pay for this. Remember what goes around comes around. You’re in deep trouble.
Mitch McConnell says he won’t even allow a bill to be voted on, to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  He is silencing the voice of every other U.S. Senator.…
CORRUPT McConnell and Senate GOP!  They rubber stamped all the slime in the Cabinet.  HOW MUCH WAS MCCONNELL PAID? Pruitt is the glaring example!  Scott Pruitt Before the E.P.A.: Fancy Homes, a Shell Company and Friends With Money https://nyti.ms/2HgnbVn  @Perduesenate
You stole a Supreme Court seat. You're a traitor and a snake. When you finally do the right by the American people and resign, you will be remembered only as a partisan hack, and then you will be forgotten entirely.

U are a partisan hack
I was going to say something negative about you @SenateMajLdr but you're entire feed is negative. Good luck in heaven, history, the Senate and 2018

Trump’s effort to get Sessions to fire and discredit Lisa Page after learning she might be a witness against him in Mueller’s probe is strong evidence of criminal obstruction of justice and looks like part of an impeachable pattern of abuse of power:

.@speechboy71: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell fiddles while the country burns. http://bos.gl/IBZvz53  
#Vets don't want a political hack with no management experience running OUR VA. Sink/skittle Jackson nomination and get a proven leader into VA. #NoPrivatizationVA
Mitch! Do for the country what the voters want! Don’t do what you want!
McConnell will be impeached and tried for crimes against humanity and the nation. Watch and see. The people will demand it when the government is balanced
Biggest stain on America is McConnell 
#mcconnellegacy #obstructor
You do realize peep like Hilary Clinton who was endorsed by a Rothschild how are the illuminati are what your dealing with. All these liberal dems have been bought and played for by these people. Time to make stuff happen! Or get out of the way!!!
What you and the rest of congress need to do is support the people you represent. We Americans are behind president trump and if you and your fellow congressmen can't back potus then we will be forced to call for a convention of states and get rid of all of you! We r watching
Have you enjoyed your suite?


Mitch McConnell refuses to hold a vote on a bill to protect Robert Mueller from being fired by Trump. So we are going to put up these billboards outside of every one of offices in Kentucky demanding he hold a vote. Please share! Thx! #ProtectMueller #AMJoy …
Is this why you won’t protect the Muelker investigation? #ComradeMcConnell #Traitor #GOPComplicit #TiesToRussia
When they are willing to steal a Supreme Court seat from a two term president legitimately elected to office,they will do anything to keep power. #ObstructionOfJustice #destroyingdemocracy #VoteThemOut2018
@DNC Don’t let this happen.
McConnell is prioritizing confirmation of conservative judges in what may be his final months as majority leader
https://politi.co/2K3uWM7  
Your boy Trump is on a rampage this morning,  he's damaging this country and everything we represent!

Your boy is revving up to fire Mueller. Put America first and put a stop to Trump’s obstructionist behavior.
@LOLGOP, @CNN, @SenSchumer 
McConnell claims KY??
Why do you attack KY & USA?:
-taking Medicare, Medicaid, & VA Benefits to pay for Rich ppl TaxCut 
-Vote No Healthcare for Millions of Americans 
-Votes GOPParty not Kentucky 
-Votes for GOPTaxScam
-Accessory to TraitorTrump
Allow the vote. Stop traitor TRUMP from firing Mueller. #ProtectMueller #ProtectRosenstein
Uh oh...
When Improving ACCOUNTABILITY ....please begin with your own Pathetic Service to the American Public. Your overinflated Ego needs flushing.
#239pounds of progress, Mitch?
I admire REAR ADMIRAL Jackson, despite his bad performance while discussing the health of @realDonaldTrump.  But that performance as well as his lack of appropriate management background also makes him a poor choice to oversee the VA.  We need someone capable of leadership.
I look forward to your long overdue retirement! Your indictment for obstruction would also be something many of us would like to see.

You guys need to stay on the job until Pomeo and others are confirmed

Are you slow or something?
@TheBeatWithAri @Lawrence @allinwithchris @NicolleDWallace   Is it true that the White House Medical Office has 70 people in it? A school, if it is lucky enough, might have one or two nurses for several hundred kids. Seems like way too many people in that office.
Want to know why McConnel et al are now pro-Russian? #corrupt #boughtByRussians 
 According to the Dallas News:
"The WEALTHCARE tax break for the richest Americans will make it possible for me to go with Donald Trump to Russia for some fun.  I will bring my plastic bed sheets so as not to piss off the Russians! "--(R-KY)  Senator Mitch McConnell
Just Build The Wall or Retire ...............
Senator? Not for long. And then an inmate for a very long time.
An active duty admiral who only got the job because he said nice things about the president yes such wonderful reasons to be nominated
Less meetings, more working please...we are waiting on appointments. Do not dare leave for another recess until this work is done.
Kentucky will VOTE YOU OUT!!  ALL OF AMERICA WILL SEE TO THAT!!
Keep your hands off VA. Privatizing it would be devastating to Veterans.
The republicans in Congress are beholden to deep-pocketed donors, demonizing the intelligence community, ignoring facts in favor of fallacies.
 "Hiding" is an innovative approach to constituent interactions?
 "Lying" is an innovative approach to constituent communications?

But they're running cover for him anyway -- with not one serious dissenter. So we're looking at a whole party so addicted to power, so determined to serve donors' interests, that it's essentially willing to condone treason. Trump is a symptom of a much deeper rot 3/

What’s trump got on you!???



@SenateMajLdr  @HouseGOP
@WhiteHouse
@SenateDems
@HouseDemocrats…
Speaking of nominations, why don't you force democrats to stay until all nominations are approved. 7 days a week.
TRAITOR!!!
Does Dr Jackson realize exactly who he’s working for and has he already pledged his loyalty to this despot? Consider this publication from Alexander Hamilton, 1792.
“McConnell allowed only 20 confirmations of district and circuit judges during Obama’s last two years, a modern low according to congressional statistics. Already he has confirmed 32 judges for Trump, including Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch”

Parental warning; This song contains bad language. Sorry, but I couldn't find any less vulgar words to describe Mitch McConnell.
You are bought and paid for.  F off
Improving accountability????????????? Then why isn't the corrupt @GOP doing anything to hold 45 accountable for his illegal tactics? Why are you letting him not enforce the sanctions Congress passed? Why do you enable his constant lying? This is just another @GOP scam - right????
How can you support this man in the job he’s been appointed to? How can you continue to look the other way while @realDonaldTrump destroys our country? The legacy you will leave will be shameful for your family for generations! I don’t know how you sleep at night!
Is he really qualified. He may be a good doctor but can he lead others and manage himself?
Being a military doctor does not make anyone qualified to run something as large as the VA. Why can't BLOTUS nominate qualified people?
Your insignificant little opinion on Mueller protection vote has been duly noted; now get the fck out of the way! #IndictMcConnellNow   #McConnellisComplicit
I look forward to the day you are ejected from the US Senate for crimes against the US government.
Maybe you should work on getting my idiot son out of office. Just saying. 15 years from now,,,,,,,,,,,,, how do you think you'll be remembered? Hmmm? Tell me Mitch..... Tell me...
Dr. Jackson is a good doctor. This doesn't qualify him to run one of largest agencies in the country! Trumps best depends on how loyal & willing to keep corruption quiet! Look at Pruitt-spending millions in violation of regulations. Trump says OK! He's loyal to Trump mission!
