We've been swindled by this failed GOP.  Tax Scam.
Tax refirm@won’t be enough it won’t get you through you need to fix the swamp and the corruption
Just quit.  The more money you "save" me the more my grandchild will have to pay.   Fair taxes to much for you to offer?  The rich, including politicians paying their fair share to hard for Republicans understand?
$20 per paycheck is all I, a teacher, got. You don’t care about the middle class.
I don't see it in my check, and frankly, I don't like you.  I don't like the way you reason, speak, look...  I don't like anything about you and I would live a happier life if you just went away.
You're better than me. I detest the old buzzard.

So these are different "tax cuts" than were recently passed, which actually raised my middle-income taxes and gave money from the government to wealthy semi-Americans?
NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Their CONSTANT plugging, mentioning, cheer-leading should tell you how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this SCAM truly is. HERE is the TRUTH! This SCAM will KILL the Middle Class!
This millionaire revealed his tax return to show just how much the GOP tax law favors the rich 
The lies!!!
If you no different from Russia then let it go so nothing happens. If you a nation of laws then act quickly and make USA a country if laws and support the people. Hold all involved with dossier to account and Urainum one  and also fisa spying
Are you pubs required to post this bull crap a certain number of times each week?
$2,000/ middle class family.
$40/week
Less than 20% of the $1.2T in debt from the #GOPTaxScam 
Time to call it what it is - #CORRUPTION - the #corrupt @GOP giving hundreds of billions to those who pay for your reelection with #DarkMoney 
It is NOT a middle class tax cut!
Roflmao. Liar.
Now fix the swamp , get rid of sessions and make sure all corruption and Comey and rosenstien and McCabe and all others are held to account. Get rid if sessions atty gen is disgrace.
Back your president. Biggest abuse of power and corruption In USA history world sees it
I was surprised to see that your old  looking dinosaur ass had a Twitter account.
Hi. Middle class here in mid America. This tax cut did nothing for us. But on the plus side, you added to the debt and are working to destroy the environment...so that’s cool.
You are a funny man senator. Do the numbers for a regular family. This tax relief actually isn’t one. I USED to vote Republican. Now I am not sure who to trust in Washington. You guys botched this one big time.
I concur. And since it was passed without a vote. Very shady.
the relief went to corporations. very shamful
Bullshit!
Your tax "cut" is only approved by like 29% of the American public. The 1% and the 28% tRumpski base.

The people are ready:
no matter how many times you say it, not gonna change the fact that majority of the savings from the #GOPTaxScam are going to stock buybacks and shareholder bonuses. the lower and middle class tax savings are going to pay higher insurance premiums from the GOP healthcare sabotage
Why won't you allow a vote on the protection of Mueller?  Why don't you let people leave voice messages on your phone line?  Why do you insist on putting party above country?  Why do you still have your job?  You're one of the worst things to happen to this country.
Yes. But who is retiring? 
PROTECT MULLER NOW!!!... .. AMERICANS WILL NOT FORGET WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALL OF OUR DEMOCRACY! 
ALL FINGERS WILL POINT TO YOU... McCONNELL !!!
Except that you're not relieving middle-class families, you're relieving big corporations and the super-wealthy!

Try the truth sometime.
Lies.
BS





I'm starting to believe that you were the key grip in that Moscow hotel room.
When should we expect that tax cut for the middle class to be real or are you simply an assbiting, bootlicker for the one percenters you have always aspired to be?
If only it were actually tax cuts for the middle class!
Shut up we see right through this nonsense. Protect Mueller
Biggest jokester  next to trump
These tax cuts for the wealthy have led to record stock buybacks and have been a big shot int the arm to already profitable corporations. QUIT TRYING TO SELL THIS FRAUD AS A BENEFIT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS!

RNC needs to run ads focussed on millennials explaining the benefits of a booming economy .. they have known only war n stagnant economy all their adult lives .. paint a vision for them .. show them hope .. don't let liberals mislead
Really? I haven’t seen major tax relief. Or minor tax relief. My taxes have gone up, you lying P.O.S.
#Liar
Save your country
What freaking “tax relief”? Im middle class and im@seeing an extra $10-15 per pay period. Do you think that does shit for me? Try selling that horse manure to someone more gullible!

WHAT ABOUT THE NEW 1,000,000,000,000 IN DEPT YOUR TAX BILL HAS LEFT IN ITS WAKE. ALSO BY NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH MUELLER PROTECTIONS YOU SHOW THAT YOU ARE A TRAITOR TO THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE BEEN SCREWING OVER FOR YEARS...TRAITOR. @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MSNBC @FoxNews
But you're working for Russian oligarchs.  #ProtectMueller
How?
No, it's not, you corporate puppet.
#GOPTaxScam
Thank you for your treason.
The tax cuts are a lie. A Reuters' poll finds that people believe the  tax  cuts help the rich and corporations over the middle class by a  margin of  58 to 13. Only 2% of Americans report a pay increase from the  law. Your attempt to buy votes FAILED.
Why don't you want to protect the firing of Mueller or Rosenstein?  Possibly you shouldn't have the right to decide on the vote, GIVEN YOUR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Trump is your wife's boss and you are unable to be unbiased.  Time to step up or step down. Recuse yourself!
Then why is the number of people living in poverty in Ohio increasing?
Yes, now we can go to Starbucks once a week, while our national debt goes up another 1.5 Trillion Dollars.  Keep up the Great Work, Senator.
You should have appropriated money to build the wall then Deport! No Amnesty.
People are not seeing tax cuts, Mitch. I know many that are actually getting less. You need to be honest, not lie about this.  Maybe I need to go out on the street and do little video interviews and post them to you, so people can't believe your lies.

Mitch McConnell's super PAC took $1 million in 2017 from Russian born billionaire who made a large portion of his money under Putin in Russia. He's taken $2.5 million in total from the same Russian. #DitchMitch …
Not working for everyone, Senator, but a great boon for high income families.
You gonna feel the same way in 10 years when the bill hits?  No, you will be hiding under a rock somewhere.  You disgust me.
Hahahahahahaha!  That’s the funniest thing I’ve read today. 

#TaxScam
Most of us won’t!
$900 next year to be offset by the price hikes caused by the China tariffs. Thanks for nothing.
Liar. #DemandAVote
Too bad the GOP Tax Scam you pushed through isn't doing anything like that.
Thank you $$$$
Tax bill is not for American families! Stop the lies & spin!! Own up to your horrendous acts!!!!
Still waiting for this "tax relief" #taxincrease #richstatessubsidizepoorstates
The operative word here is...
"NEARLY ALL AMERICANS",
The rich yeahbut probably not for middle or low
Income status
Bring Mueller protection to the floor.
Too bad the web site doesn't work.
Not allowing the bill to protect Mueller is outrageous. You should resign as you clearly are not doing your job. Just another  chicken heart fearing the wrath of Trump.Couldn’t you cower for a better person?
Words from an American traitor.
How about those 33,000 jobs being lost by the Toys R Us employees and the huge bonuses the big guys received? Haven’t heard ONE word from any of you. Get ready for your unemployment numbers to rise.
LIE   this was a tax cut for your rich donors
You may want a new Twitter handle come Nov. 

Might I suggest @ignorantMachiavellian or is that too long?
No matter how much you try to sell this. It is not  MAJOR Tax Relief for the middle class... #GOPTAXSCAM
As a public servant, it's your duty to follow the will of the people. The people call for protection for the special counsel. You have no legitimate reason to not allow this vote. History will remember. #protectmueller #ditchmitch

You're full of shit! Major tax cut??? Give me a break.  I make well under $100k and it's a few dollars, anything BUT major. What a liar!
How do you sleep at night, #liar? Wages aren’t not increasing, there aren’t more #jobs.  Companies are doing stock buybacks and upping CEO pay. This #GopTaxScam does nothing for the #economy, but you and your lying, traitorous comrades will profit. #StopLying
Good morning you are correct about the persons. Who get special treatment from I.R.S. refund  checks while i have to pay for them..with my money...that i send to this Department..this is not right sistem should be Investigation about this Matter...? ? ? ?
Big lie and we all know it.

Why are you still lying? We know this was nothing but a cash grab by you & greedy #GOP #GOPTaxScam is a joke & you know it. Remember you work for us! And we know you were given millions from Russian oligarch. Not cool Mitch. Now you refuse to #ProtectMueller #PutinsPuppet
Douchebag


McConnell is responsible for 2 of the most disgraceful acts in history of US politics: blocking Merrick Garland & killing bipartisan response to Russian hacking. Enabling firing of Mueller would be the third https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/986347509281730560 …
For about two seconds...You idiot.  My theory is that McConnell encountered name calling as a child and so has become the bully as revenge for this.  I see inside his soul and all I see is Smug and Ugly, which is what his politics are all about.
Nearly is the optimum word!
No more repuglinuts for me!
You are a liar Mitch McConnell. Why are you not passing a bill to protect Mueller? Are you afraid of him finding out something about you too? Collusion with trump/Russia? Are you hiding something from the American people?

Shut up please the tax cut is not for middle class. Lying ass

Are your taxes going up next year?  If you’re not wealthy or a corporation, you have a 30% chance of paying more taxes next year, higher if you live in a blue state. And your kids will definitely pay much more — the GOP borrowed from them to lower the corporate rate even further.
I wouldn't be getting a job in now in fixing dents in cars, replacing the doors, bumpers etc  or even trying to fix engines that obviously begin on fire or are hit by lightning and are ruined in a second's hit.  Lightning and hurricanes take care of it all ...inside and out.
"Middle-class" my ass.
Your budget-busting giveaway benefits a small percentage of people in the USA.
Most of us out here don't MAKE 7 figure incomes...or even 6 figures.

Your oath was to the Constitution and the People of the USA

NOT JUST "SOME" OF THE PEOPLE

#INVESTIGATE
Tax cuts are a sham. You're borrowing to pay for them. Guess it's okay to let the White guy who filed bankruptcy six times, do it, but not the Black guy. You're a racist

MCCONNELL:

— told GWB to withdraw troops from Iraq to boost Rs in midterms…
What tax relief. There is no middle class tax relief. You are full of lies.

Mitch McConnell's super PAC took $1 million in 2017 from Russian born billionaire who made a large portion of his money under Putin in Russia. He's taken $2.5 million in total from the same Russian. #DitchMitch …
Our country's legislative process will be much improved when you are GONE.  You should join Paul Ryan and the exodus.
Tax reform....what a joke!
That is a total lie.  The majority of the tax benefits go to your rich buddies and donors.  The bill is a disgrace and a knife in the back to most Americans.  Plus, it significantly increases the deficit.  You have nothing to be proud of.  So, stop tweeting this garbage.
We need to be able to write off health costs.
I don’t believe you.
And it goes away over time! But the corporate cut stays!
Make tax cuts PERMANENT!
BS
Mueller bill must be allowed on the floor of the Senate for a VOTE
That's the lie the Republicans told Americans. That the Tax Breaks for the Rich and Corporations Act was for the middle class.  The Tax Breaks for the rich will add $1.9 trillion to the deficit.
You’re complicit in Russia collusion for refusing to protect those investigating Trump.
Protect Mueller investigation. Bring the bipartisan bill to the floor. 67% of us support this investigation.
It's a #GOPTaxScam and the polls are not in your favor. The people know it was the wealthy who benefit at the expense of increasing deficits and ultimate cuts to Social Security Medicare, Medicaid and assistance.  You are not the fiscally responsible party! Irresponsible.
Hey Mitch -- If you really cared about America, you would

WATCH: Big corporations have spent nearly $235 billion on stock buybacks. That helps executives and shareholders, not American workers -- even @FoxNewsSunday isn't denying that fact. 
First off, nobody likes shots to the arm so that's a very poor analogy and every other word is an outright lie. Plus, you're riches don't follow you into the "afterlife" #kingtut
IS THIS A JOKE????
Nobody with a double or triple digit IQ believes this.

You don’t care about working class Americans.  You care about keeping the rich rich   At least you could own it

STOP LYING
Mitch you will go down in history not as a hero but a villain of democracy. Your choice to withhold a bill protecting Muller and the investigation, is the action of a traitorous punk.
Lock you up and your Pres.
We'll see! Time is not on your side.
You continue to collude with the President. Stand up to his ludicrous behavior and tweets! Feebly changing the narrative to taxes won’t divert attention from the collision course we’re on towards a #ConstitutionalCrisis. Do your job!
@msnbc @cnn McConnell pushed tax legislation that gives more of American's tax dollars to the rich, & now he is personally wasting time (& more of our tax dollars) on Twitter trying to disguise the theft.  At any other company in America he would be fired for loafing on the job.
This tax cut you keep speaking of ... & all the money people & #SmallBiz  have been enjoying .... when do the cuts kick in? Are they sprinkled  out in alphabetical order or are they only for registered republicans?  We haven't gotten any extra & our small business hasn't either.
Um, no.  Maybe for you and POTUS cronies but not for me, a teacher , and most of those like me, who have to pay more so rich folk like you can sit back and enjoy your bulletproof car upholstery and disgracefully expensive office furniture.
Liar.

You're a coward, and you will be removed from office by the voters soon.
Time for @CIA and @FBI and @OfficeGovEthics to investigate this corrupt liar, his wife in Trumps cabinet should have him stepping down as speaker due to conflicts of interests. Toting his tax give away to millions and his backers shows his corruption #ProtectMueller #corruption

But your wife got a gig right
It will lead us to more debt, you borrowed the money! What is wrong with this party? You call yourselves conservatives! How is that!
My taxes have increased because you eliminated the personal exemption.  Dumb.

 It very well may be a big shot to the arm, but the hangover isn't going to feel so great.
im middle class and my taxes went up. i think you’re the one you refer to when you say tax “relief”.
@SpeakerRyan  @HouseGOP  @SenateGOP  @NancyPelosi  @SenatorSchumer 1. Maj Ldr- your tax act is a scam, you wasted 1+ tr $$! 2. You told Fox today there is no need to bring protection legislation for Special Counsel Mueller to the US SENATE FOR A VOTE?? OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK!

What will your tweet be next year when middle class workers don't adjust their taxes and they owe thousands of dollars in extra taxes?
Got an approximate time frame on that Mitch?
