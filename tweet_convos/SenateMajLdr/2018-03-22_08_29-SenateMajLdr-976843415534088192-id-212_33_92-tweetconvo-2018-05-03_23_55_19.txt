You're going to be replaced with a Senator who supports our @POTUS. You and @SpeakerRyan have got to go. WE WILL DEFEAT YOU! 

#MAGA
I don’t think President Trump agrees with you. Especially after $700 Billion to our military was just passed.
I would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the Senate of the MASSIVE TAX CUT & Reform Bill. I could have not asked for a better or more talented partner. Our team will go onto many more VICTORIES!
We'll see. It looks like @POTUS can actually divert that money anywhere he wants to since it's not an actual budget. You may be right, we'll see.
I’ve seen some tweets mentioning that. I’m not sure to what extent that’s true or not. I’m looking deeper into it to verify, but for now we see how it plays out... 
You care about stopping drugs? #FundTheWall. Don’t take opioids from those who really hurt. Cut off illegal drugs (the wall) & the problem is solved
I hope that is true for KY.
So much PORK and waste in this bill it makes me SICK!  It's clear you care nothing about the future generations and the debt you are placing on them. Where are your conservative values? You're no different than a DEM.
You are just throwing good money away if you don't build that WALL!
You Sir out the door in November.
DO not be a turncoat & pass a spending measure funding a tunnel & sanctuary cities. You have proven to be a disappointment over and over to the your base, why don't you just change to the democrat partyYou are doing this to hurt Trump.  FUND THE WALL
I thought Mexico was paying for the wall.
You guys let the American People down.. your disgusting
Why don’t you just change parties.this bill was http://egregious.Democrat  run and not what we want.
You get something for KY. so you stay on the HILL, what about all the babies that will die because you are funding the MURDERERS...
Tell the truth and same the devil this bill has no money for Affordable Care Act fix and without the fix to the ACA we will all suffer with higher healthcare cost but millions of taxpayers dollars for @POTUS Trump parade is sickening #VoteThemOut2018 #BamboozledAmerica
When we only asked for common sense gun reform @GOP Republicans possibly take rights away from abt 4.2 Million Americans to buy a gun so much for 2nd Amendment #Okie-dok #BamboozledAmerica
Mr McConnell, it's always talk of grandiose plans in spending money. People would love a receipt & proof of purchase for all the money given, r you planning on that? We want the wall, we want nuclear option Harry Reid afforded Obama so willingly. Well b waiting. @realDonaldTrump
Pork and Congress go hand in hand!
And it funds Planned Parenthood.Evil.
It gives you a $20000 raise, funds Planned Parenthood, supports Liberal NPR, gives Dems everything they want thanks to YOU and RYAN There is no honor left in Congress
This bill is disgusting. How could you go along with this crap. You had better put a bill on Trumps desk that fully funds boarder wall and fast!!! Also you need to pass legislation that ties federal funds with adhering to immigration laws. Fast!!!! Your blowing this for our Pres.
U voted 4 a raise 4 yourself, no wall, planned parenthood, money going to China & other countries. No DACA, nothing 4 border agents, funding sanctuary cities. Not POTUS agenda! Your no leader.
Man carry your ERNEST T BASS looking ass somewhere and sit down, better yet, through some rocks as the white house windows, its me its me Ernest t.
We’re done with the Republican Party. This bill goes against every promise made that got the GOP elected.  So out of touch with Americans.
Soldiers and opioids
But no $ for the wall??? BUILD THE WALL
Senate Majl leader, what good will it do to rehab opioid smugglers  coming in from Mexico, if we do not stop the flow.  This is not prevention, it's just trying to heal the sickness.
This budget makes a strong case for congressional term limits. If term limits are appropriate for the POTUS, term limits are even more appropriate for the senate.
It’s time to reign in our President. Mr. Senate Majority Leader, what does Russia have on the GOP that they refuse to reign in this rogue leader?
We need a border wall not a tunnel.
You need to talk to Paul and Cruz...  looks like they both don't like it.
VETO this spending bill! You gave the Democrats everything! This is Obama era spending! This isn’t what we voted for!
No, no it's not. Have you figured out Trump doesn't give a shit about most of you who voted for him yet? He was a Democrat not too long ago! THANKS for sticking us all with him.
This massive spending bill is totally UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!! It's full of Democratic entitlements that Republicans promised to defund and Schumer's tunnel expense is also unacceptable!!!!!! Stop this madness of spending!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump
You need to step down!!!
You are no leader!!!
This bill is loaded with Billions in waste so we don’t care to hear any spin !  Rand Paul tells the truth ! @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @RandPaul @seanhannity @SenateGOP @JohnCornyn @tedcruz @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson #VetoTheOmnibus #DemocratsInCharge
This spending bill is the end of your political 'Career' even though congress was never meant to be a Career! That's why it's called a service...but looking through your time in office I'd say you served yourself!
You are a coward
Broken promises by GOP, again!
@realDonaldTrump
Your leaving all the bad things out of your tweets Mitch this spending bill has Mitch if you don't think We The People don't see right through you all better think again there's gonna be a lot of changes this November that's when you wish you took part in MAGA
No one likes you.
You need to be removed. You are one of the reasons I will not contribute to the RNC. #DrainTheSwamp
When are you sorry ass Republicans going to do something about you out of control President, you Republicans are all going to have a lot of blood on your hands if you don’t stand up to him, for out Nation he has got to go. Republican Leaders under Nixon stood up. This is worse
Your spending bill is terrible and going to cause defectors in the next big election. We the people are tired of all this spending why do you not get that
@realDonaldTrump
Did you read it? Much waste, outdated request for money without oversight money spent in wrong direction for wrong reasonits almost; its about who, not what needs the money. Widely misplace priorities. With some organization and priorities I am sure the bill could be justified
And for rural areas everywhere, China’s tariff on soybeans are going to hit the American farmer right in the pocketbook! Are you deliberately TRYING to ruin us... you and Commandant Trumpsky???!!!
I'm surprised you're still alive , you are like 150 years old @SenateMajLdr
A comma goes after “funding.”

#EnglishclassMitch.
You've screwed healthcare so bad it won't matter.  Hope Kentuckians wise up and boot you out. One day they will realize republicans are crapping on them, hopefully soon.
Need to eliminate super majority for appropriations senator.  Never been a constitutional requirement and need to do it to separate yourself from the Rinos which you're on top of the political dung heap right now.
Way too much spending! Get rid of filibuster so U can pass a sensible budget!

The choice between healthcare or food has caused this problem, fixing it requires more than counseling the addiction, fund healthcare, free preventive, including mental, walls will not stop this problem
GRATE JOB. GOOD YOU CHANGED THE RULES ON VOTING. SO NOW GET RID OF THE FILLIBUSTER ON OTHER LEGISTATION SO YOU CAN GET SOMTHING DONE
fully fund wall construction
DON’T. PASS THIS HORRIFIC BILL.    President Trump, if this spending bill passes the Senate, PLEASE VETO IT.  @POTUS signing this bill guarantees your impeachment.  VETO the spending bill.  VETO.  VETO.  VETO.  VETO.
How about page 2,212 where you institute the CLOUD act. Stop sneaking junk into budgets hat remove our Constitutional freedoms and protection please.
Wake up, he is on the loose again, lawyer and nsa, you cant make this up, who does he pick bolten, mr bomb um, you talk about kentucky, id worry about the country, wake up, this is your fault you know what he is like you and ryan better stand up soon before its to late!
How soon will the Opioid selling Big PhARMA CEO's be going to PRISON?

Not all the pork. Cut and save then implement the spending once debt is paid down. We the regular people have to live like this—not a millionaire that’s been in office too long!
Or you & the govt could quit helping big pharma and save us taxes. Hypocrite jackwads. Legalize mmj.

Ok. Let me tell you what’s really happening. I take care of the elderly in their homes. It’s becoming harder and harder for them to get their pain meds!  They are in their nineties for heaven sake. They are not dealing in the street. Medicare will make it even harder. You rat
@SenateMajLdr   What is your stand?  U are typically an obstructionist to trump agenda.  Defund planned parenthood, defund sanctuary cities and build the wall!
@realDonaldTrump
#VETO

Why have you failed to even debate or vote on Appropriation Bills passed by the House? Now you try to tell us the only way to fund the government is this bloated monstrosity “Omnibus Bill”?

#RetireInPlace - the RINO motto
Say what you want but you have betrayed the people who gave you all the power! The bill sucks!!!
@realDonaldTrump
Where is our wall funding? Where is the money for more border police? This bill is a joke. I hope Trump veto's this junk. Also, when are you going to resign, China owns you.
how bout u tell us everything that is in this bill
Great job Democrat. Looks like you failed all republicans again.
Oldass mutant Congress turtle 
What about fully funding the Wall, defunding Sanctuary Cities and Planned Parenthood? #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump
@SenateMajLdr  stop tooting your Opioid epidemic BS. And Military spending Make up caused by the Obama administration..! Fact..your back door Deal with @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer , We want our Wall as this is a factor of security to our Nation, address's illegal drugs and Aliens.
@realDonaldTrump
Keep on spending you own the deficit
Why, because you're taking away their #ACA, including all the jobs it provided in #Kentucky?  How about all the programs for clean air and water the #EPA is killing and grants for programs that help homeless veterans and the elderly?
Stop enabling @realDonaldTrump .
What is in it for you? There has to be something as that would be the only reason you care.
It feels like my wife is mad at me and headed to town with the check book to teach me a good lesson...
You old turkey you.need to be fired or retired

McConnell your full of it if you think the people are so dumb that you would have a bill that's so ridiculously  trillion s more than was when ever sent to Obama STOP  have a budget like everyday people have to live with
Taking  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE NRA in exchange for Your  VOTE  is a Big Deal your a thief and liar and should resign The Anerican  People deserve  BETTER THAN THE TRASH ON THE HILL ALL TAKING ILLEGAL KICK BACKS RUBIO  RYAN FROM THE KOCHS ENOUGH OF YOU ALL. BLUE WAVE COMING
NO WE THE PEOPLE DO NOT CONSENT TO THIS OMINOUS BUS WRECK BILL!!!
@realDonaldTrump
How come you don’t make big pharma pay for opioid treatments considering they’re the reason there’s even an #OpioidEpidemic?  Oh I forgot...you’re in their pocket
He is in China's pocket.

Retire Mitch, you're a useless twat!  Take @SpeakerRyan w/ you
All the while making it harder to get access to healthcare
This bill is a big waste of tax payers $.  I thought Mexico was paying for the stupid wall? Liars.
You are bad at your job
Dow skids 400 points on fears of China trade war in advance of Trump remarks http://dlvr.it/QM1PsT  
This is sinful that your party is in control and can whip through tax reform with no Democrats do the same for DACA  because 87% of us Americans are going to VOTE blue buddy!  Want to remain in control & keep red seats?Then fix DACA so DACA recipients have citizenship!
The bill also gives Schumer a billion dollars for crooked NY unions to build a tunnel. Guess the Dems are still in charge since you and GOP can't figure out how to say "no".
@realDonaldTrump

Just can't trust the @POTUS

There you have it folks........he supports whatever the @TheDemocrats want.  He still can't hear the roar of Americans accross this country.  Let's see if he can read tweets.  #DitchMitch  #BuildThatWall #NoTunnel  #NoSanctuaryCitites  #NoPlannedParenthood  #RinoCowards
@realDonaldTrump
THE BILL MAY HAVE A FEW OF THESE MUCH NEEDED THINGS IN IT, BUT THE SNEAKY THROW IN OF A TUNNEL IS NOT WARRANTED! WE DONT NEED THAT! WE NEED A WALL TO PREVENT ILLEGAL CRIMINALS FROM COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY! IT WILL STOP THE FLOW OF DRUGS & HUMAN TRAFFICKING! DONT SIGN THIS BILL!
@realDonaldTrump
Sorry, and this may be a tad rough but..as i feel for those affected by opiods they made a choice. Unborn babies do not make the choice to be aborted and Kate Steinle did not choose to be murdered by an illegal..
What about DOMESTIC DOCTORS and DOMESTIC PHARMA COS. flooding Kentucky cities, towns and villages with OPIODS? When will PHARMA COS. stop getting "rubberstamped" approvals from INDIA that have more warnings than TNT?
Hi, my name is Jack and I demand a wonderdrug with no side-effects because I have no idea how pharmacology works.
This isn't budget GOP members of Congress have promised & campaigned on for years. Actions speak louder than words. End result; Dems have succeeded in suppressing GOP vote in Fall.  Tax cuts not enough to overcome this debacle! @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @Marcshort45 @GOP
#  Veto #NotWhatWeVotedFor #NoToOmnibusBill
Where is the wall. Why is there being a tunnel made for New Jersey and New York before THE WALL.  We vote for the Trump platform not for what your cronies want.  WE WANT THE WALL!!!  NOT MOBEY FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD THAT KILLS BABIES.  SHAME ON YOU MCCONNELL.
@realDonaldTrump
That's all well and good but, you need to take out the #DarkMoneyRiders!
But still doesn't provide boarder security & sanctuary city prevention to save lives. The #OpioidEpidemic is important & we expect funding. "We" expect the same for protection from the threat of #IllegalImmigration! NOT AN OPTION! #Vote2018 #DOYOURJOB! @GOP @POTUS @FoxNews @CRTV
It also cuts Medicare.
The opioid crisis you helped create
LIAR! It’s the swamp! More spending, more government!
@realDonaldTrump
You’re such a bought politician!!
Please don’t insult folks, especially in Kentucky, by your lip service to an epidemic that should have been addressed with a bill from you A LONG TIME AGO!
You DON’T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF KENTUCKY!
This is a piece of crap! And I hope President Trump vetoes it! Shameful #draintheswamp
If this bill passes yal are gone I can't believe this tell Mr Trump he will not win 2020
@realDonaldTrump
Awful deal, fund PP, fund New York pork, no money for wall except for border fence not wall.  This is a total disgrace to we Americans that voted for potus. Veto this SOB
35 million to your family from chinese. Where is my family's cut Mitch? I served 22 years for you to have that special opportunity to take BRIBES from a hostile foreign government.

... What say you Mr. & Mrs. Chow? I demand my cut. I have complaints in with the FTC. Pay me. NOW
Is that the best you could do to defend this bill, vote no
The only scourge is the GOP lying to its base
@realDonaldTrump
NO TAX $$ to Planned Parenthood or sanctuary cities
WHEN will you all start listening to your constituents?
@SpeakerRyan @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @WhiteHouse 
BUILD THE WALL
They hear a bit, but people like you aren't the majority either. GOP can't get everything they want on their own.
This bill should not pass or should get vetoed by the President
@realDonaldTrump
#MarchOnWashington
As the border wall should have been. And it's not just about the #OpioidEpidemic. Plenty of other illegal drugs like heroin flow from the US/Mexican border. A paltry 25 Billion out of 1.3 Trillion should not have been a big deal. This Omnibus bill needs to be rejected.
@realDonaldTrump
I am happy you are dealing with the opioid addiction. I hope you help those who need the help. 
I hope you are compassion ite to those with serious physical issues.
REPUBLICAN PROPAGANDA RUN AMOCK!!!!!!!!
And Mcconnell still doesn't care about school children being slaughtered by gunfire...
A Huge Deal, Trump may want to congratulate you. Pricey improvements spends $booty we have not made, & overextends our budgeted resources..
And kicks millions off healthcare which is the goal of the GOP.  Take care of the rich and let everyone else suffer.
You know what else #Kentucky needs help with? Gun Violence. Where is your bill for saner gun laws? #MarchForOurLives
Expanding Healthcare would be better for #Kentucky but oh well you voted no for it. 
Don’t pass that abomination, we didn’t vote you guys to keep funding plan parenthood and sanctuary cities, we vote for a fully founded border wall , don’t tide up our military with democrats spending 
You are screwing us again
@realDonaldTrump
Thank you @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi @POTUS but I'm not convinced this 6 month budget bill does the right thing. But, you tried.
This is the worst ever
38T dollar debt in 10 years #insolvency
@SenateGOP It’s time to end filibuster rule for authorization and appropriation bills.
@HouseGOP @freedomcaucus @SpeakerRyan @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump
How long have you run that shitshow and you're only now getting around to dealing with the opioid crisis?
You have to start with stopping this big Pharmaceuticals from pushing opioids to small town and denounce clinic who order pills for a million when their town are nno more than 50 thousand people
Shame on you for BLOWING up the national deficit. . .
If we don't fund and build THE WALL on the southern border we won't have a country!!!!  That should be priority!  I hope President Trump Veto's this bill.  #FakeMemos  #MAGA #SchiffForBrains #KeepAmericaGreat #AmericansAreDreamersToo #NoWallNoDACA #FullOfShiff #McCabeFired
@realDonaldTrump
So why has the Senate declined to include key #hsa fixes in the #omnibus? 1. Cover Rx drugs for chronic conditions below the deductible. 2. Increase HSA contributions to the Out of Pocket Max. 3. Allow working seniors on Medicare to keep their HSA.
You have just written a direct fundraiser check to the DNC! Because they can't get diddly-squat on their own!
You have betrayed our country. Your shame will never end.
@realDonaldTrump
The Wall Mitch we want the Wall do the will of the people !!!!!
@realDonaldTrump
This is a big deal to MAGA voters! @realDonaldTrump PLEASE veto this bill!
How much does it take from SS, Medicare, we need to fire all of you fool's or (tools) and start all over again, something like kill them all and let GOD sort them out
Your spending bill also funds planned parenthood and sanctuary cities 
Crooked !!!
#DrainTheSwamp    NOW
Ohh, the humanity. So sad!
Legalize recreational drugs and treat abuse/addiction.
MORE #TaxPayer TO #DC Slavery! You've NEVER wanted to "lead" or fight to represent AMERICANS! You and @SpeakerRyan are as bad as communist Democrats, it's ALL about enslaving us to DC & your billionaire donors. @PRyan @AshLeeStrong #EndObamaCare! @realDonaldTrump @StephenMillerAL
Hey Monster,

You are literally the worst type of sick and twisted individual. Consider yourself blocked, reported, and soon to be removed for harassing people with your vile thoughts. If there is a God I pray that it never allows you to be near real children.


That's so cute, pretending to care about people. 

What am I saying, of course some aid wrote this. Not Bert himself.
Medicaid pays for the bulk of addiction treatment and you want to gut Medicaid.
If you are looking for help why pass a bill that will kick 13 million off of healthcare many of them in Kentucky? Why allow premiums to rise 10%+ due to your actions? Why give yourself and wife a huge tax cut?
What page is that on??

Stupid Turtle 
Liar!   Screw Kentucky.  Us Coastal Elites that you all love to disparage say let them pay for it themselves!
Harsh sweetie.
