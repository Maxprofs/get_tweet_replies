NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Their CONSTANT plugging, mentioning, cheer-leading should tell you how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this SCAM truly is. HERE is the TRUTH! This SCAM will KILL the Middle Class!
This millionaire revealed his tax return to show just how much the GOP tax law favors the rich 
#CorkerKickback #GOPComplicit #GOPTaxScam
The party that dying hopefully will just disappear
You were defensive, not definitive. That says something.
McConnells wife is in the Cabinet, so he is NOT bringing a vote to protect Mueller.
Now the national debt is even more out-of-control, but of course it's the Democrat's fault.  Every two year old knows that.
Great just reminded us of how you cut our SALT deduction which applies to many homeowners and state taxpayers and gave deductions for millionaires private jets. Thanks for making it even harder for young people to own a home.
#ProtectMueller
As a public servant, it's your duty to follow the will of the people. The people call for protection for the special counsel. You have no legitimate reason to not allow this vote. History will remember. #protectmueller #ditchmitch
Don’t worry we will remember Republicans are totally to blame for the #GOPTaxScam  and the huge deficits it will cause.

A Putin-pawn in office, brought to you by complicit #Senate Republicans.
Now how about some rescissions on that Omnibus?!

Hope you are reading the comments on the Opinion piece, in WaPo, about you, this morning. BIG MISTAKE, not bringing that legislation to a vote. What did your wife tell you to do? Did she tell you that vote would make her boss unhappy? #Recuse!

We won't forget it either. #GOPTaxBillScam
GOP TAX SCAM THAT ONLY BENEFITS THE RICH AND CORPORATIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS!!!

Kind of tipped your hand by putting [reform] in brackets. Letting lobbyists highjack the tax code isn’t [Reform].
  
Idiot says what?

McConnell thinks he took his oath to the RNC not the constitution https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
Yeah the gig is up, only top 1% see it and most is going towards buybacks!
Along with trillion$ deficits, abdication of support for the Constitution & rule of law, diminishment of American leadership, coddling of dictators, and failure to stand with Allies.  PLEASE STOP!  #nolongergop
Dear #Kentucky, ask yourselves what Russia has on your toady boy
On @TeamCavuto, McConnell shuts the door on the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller: “I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor, that’s my responsibility as majority leader, we’ll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.”
#TaxScam Day, brought to you by #Senate Republicans.
Failure for the people of USA.  Credit for ruining the economy an increasing disparitie(in addition to increasing taxes) belongs with  @SenateMajLdr  and the republicans.
You call yourself "leader" McConnell -Why not display some REAL leadership and make policies that work for ALL Americans, instead of a tiny wealthy minority?

Guard the USA from Russian espionage, instead of blocking protections 4 loyal Americans investigating it.

LEAD or LEAVE
The tax scam.

Trump says US wages are rising “for the first time in 18 years”

this is false…
Oh we know who brought us this middle class tax fraud. We know, and we won’t forget. #BeneathTheSwamp
Who are you kidding? No trickle-down in sight while corporations and the already rich stash more cash and corporations buy-back stock to benefit CEOs and shareholders. What was your windfall Mitch?
It's the usual sham 'trickle down' theory; give to the rich and hope and pray you get the crumbs from the tables they dine at.  If Mueller gets fired, traitor, YOU'RE NEXT!
Who's going to pay for it?

#GOPTaxBillScam and #Deficit brought to you by the #Senate weasels!

BREAKING:
@SenateMajLdr :you denied bill to protect Mueller. Now it’s our turn to deny you and all other Republicans that are actively working to destroy our government.
Retweet if your tired of republicans and want change!
#VoteNoGOP #NoMoreGOP
Go to hell. My paycheck is unchanged but the Kochs got 1 billion.
#NoThanks. Trillions of new debt for @WorkingFamilies, courtesy of @SenateGOP. Again, #NoThanks
Tax cuts for wealthy and a trillion dollar deficit brought to us by YOU.  Ironic that you’ve spouted off about Democrats overspending for your entire miserable career despite facts proving Republicans add to deficit every time. Democrats lower deficit. #ResignNow #MitchMustGo
It's NOT tax reform. It's tax cuts for the rich. Tell the truth.
It’s a scam, and why won’t you bring the bill to protect Mueller to a floor vote? You must be guilty as hell, also! How much money did the Russians pay for your soul?
You are a POS turtle man!   No balls to stand up to trump the thief!   He is doing everything opposite of what a normal person does and you let it go! – at Spring Pond Farm
You fools, borrowed1.5 trillion to give the rich that was doing great more money, companys that were doing great permanent tax cuts! The average joe, crumbs, what happened to the conservatives, really!!! This isnt just the president, it took the administration to be this stupid
Taxation is theft.
Scamday brought to you by a turtle.

How about your leader showing us his taxes?  Oh that's right.  As long as you and the kleptocratic klan can continue on the road to riches, you don't give a tinker's damn about the sideshow in the Oval.  How much did you get from Vladdy or his Daddy?!?
During the 2015-2016 election season, Russian billionaire Leonard Blavatnik contributed $6.35 million to leading Republican candidates and incumbent senators. Mitch McConnell was the top recipient of Blavatnik's donations, collecting $2.5 million.
As a cardinal rule of life, the #GOP should never be thanked for anything.

#frailmortalMitch
Mostly to millionaires if you’re honest!
The Trillion Dollar debt brought to you by #Senate Republicans.
Are you filing all that money you took from the Russian under the new code?
What are you hiding? Protect Mueller now


Tax reform for billionaires,tax repulsion for working men and women. $1.5 trillion deficit,paid for by seniors,disabled, and children
we see you, Russian Traitor...The effort to pass legislation to protect Mueller’s job as special counsel hit a dead end as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not allow the bill to come to the floor for a full Senate vote - NBC
What’s your kompromat, Mitch??
Too bad the voters aren’t buying your #GOOTaxScam -
Republicans are struggling to sell their tax cuts to the U.S. electorate https://bloom.bg/2JQ5Dgo  
1.5 Trillion dollars in added federal deficits to pay for tax subsidies for extremely wealthy corporate investors, brought to by Senate Republicans.
Shame on you and all of the @gop for this tax scam, for not protecting Mueller, and for wasting tax payers time and money doing nothing for our well being.  #countryoverparty
Pig
You should all be hanging your heads in shame.
You filibustered the gun bill in 2013, you stole a Scotus seat, obstructed 44 even when it was for the good of the country. You scewed w/our insurance. Passed a #TaxScamBill w/a $1.5 trillion increase in debt. Refused to announce Russian interference & won't protect Mueller. FU
Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes
Are you serious? Brought to you by treasonous Republicans for rich people. The country will figure it out Mitch...that they’ve be conned!
Please stop boasting and approve Mr President's appointees and all judges he asked for. You acting more and more like a DC swamp creature. Reduce our budget and cut the waist by 50%. MAGA
The GOP increased the deficit by TRILLIONS so that billionaires don’t have to pay taxes! #VoteThemOut
$1.9 trillion added to the deficit so you could give tax breaks to your wealthy contributors.
GOP Tax Scam!!!

Amazon made $5.6 billion in 2017 and paid no federal income taxes. #TaxDay https://www.seattlepi.com/business/tech/article/Amazon-paid-no-US-income-taxes-for-2017-12713961.php …
You belong on Comedy Central. You are LAUGHABLE.
#TrickleUpEconomics - stealing from the poor to give to the rich - pillaging the country - is what has been brought to us by the senate repubs.  wear it with pride cause you gonna surf outta office on this
Oh, don’t worry. We know who’s to blame for the #TaxScam.
History is not going to be kind to you.
The tax plan is killing us in California. But you know that, don’t you? #TaxScam

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
The GOP tax cuts down side that the Republican don't talk about: Current debt 21 Trillion and accelerating.  Or, debt per citizen $64,000 + and interest of $8,000 +. Estimated total cumulative wealth held by top 10% of families = 80%.  Wealth held by 90% of families only 20%. SAD
Scum
How about some spending cuts. Mmm...Yummy.
Impeachment day will be brought to you by the DEMOCRATS. 

Why NOT #ProtectMueller ? 
Nobody knows what the orange moron will do from minute to minute. 
You are FULL OF CRAP MITCH.

#ProtectMueller . 
What is the REAL reason you wont
You & your party are celebrating the new tax law. Must be nice for you wealthy folks to see financial gains! All the rest of us see is continual loss of money. You threaten the social security we paid for so you can have even more $. Rot in hell with the Moron in my White House!!

I feel the screwing up my ass from the corrupt @gop tax scam. Do something good for once and protect Mueller from the #CRIMINALPresident
Wow, is this #TaxReform all for us??? 

As a multi-billionaire, thank you for making America great for me again. 
You are a feckless, cowardly Vichy puppet and toady boy who puts party over country. May you forever sport the Trump tattoo.
On @TeamCavuto, McConnell shuts the door on the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller: “I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor, that’s my responsibility as majority leader, we’ll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.”
: it’s not your responsibility to override every other R senator with your God complex. You are getting as bad as Trump. Thus you are likely as guilty of some shady dealings as  on your end. 

You don’t need to remind us. We won’t forget. Your #taxscam bill will be due soon.
$21T of debt, brought to you by Democrats AND Republicans!
Continued carried interest loophole, brought to you by senate republicans.
Increased national debt, brought to you by senate republicans.

When I have grandchildren someday, I'll be sure to let them know why they have to pay so much more in debt. Because senate repubs thought it would be a good idea to INCREASE the natl debt during good economic times.
And the #KochBrothers , you won’t be able to hide the real insidious nature of the #GOPTaxScam from voters this fall #BlueWave2018

Laughing so hard at the sales blitz on GOP tax scam today.  27% approval 
Tax Reform does not add to National Debt. You passed a tax CUT that exploded the National Debt. Tax Reform you Republicans don’t have enough since to figure out. You got what you wanted Gave Republican Donors and Corporations lots of money that Working folks & poor will suffer.

Dirty turtle, allow the #ProtectMueller bill.
This is just Republican propaganda. 
Report as spam to prevent the spread of fake news.
Glad to see you are finally taking responsibility for something the majority of the country doesn’t like. When it really goes bad, you’ll try to blame it on Obama.

Along with trillions in debt and deficit, and Putin’s hand picked guy in WH.  Thanks.  #NoGOPutin
Mitch again reminding everyone that he never really cared about the deficit.

Mitch, we get it. You never cared about it.
More like Tax scam reform. #shameonyou
At what are you thoughts on the ballooning deficit Mitch McConnell? How reckless!
So much for affordable healthcare?
Everytime you tweet, I hate Republicans even more. & I'm a republican!!Like Trump says: Sad, very sad. You& Ryan will go down bad in history
Mitch are u trying to be funny. Give me a break!!
Then f-you Senate Republicans because you are costing me money.
#GOPTaxScam brought to you by greedy Republican Swamp Monsters.
What dirt do the Russians have on you, Mitch?
#GOPTaxScam sucks
A sad day in the lives of the common man, and with the Republicans passing a tax bill by themselves, the common man will now pay the price for the wealthy again. The people of this country got blindsided and they don’t know it yet. They’ll start seeing shortly.
I agree! Shameful! And let's not forget after the bill was passed, the wealthy Koch brothers gave $500,000 to the Paul Ryan campaign war chest! They stand to make tens of millions of dollars in tax savings? Scam!

On @TeamCavuto, McConnell shuts the door on the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller: “I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor, that’s my responsibility as majority leader, we’ll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.”
Why is your website down?
Time to investigate McConnell.
Reform for who? Not the middle class, that’s for sure!
That’s five tweets. Still wrong. Try for six
Brought to your billionaire bosses, you foul looter.
oh we're gonna remember who it was 'brought to us' by in November Mitch - no worries!!
Keep telling yourself that, we don’t believe it, Americans call B.S.
trillion dollar deficits, also brought to us by #senate republicans and @SpeakerRyan and @GOP in general.....
Correction: Tax cuts for #RepublicanOligarchs like you. #TaxDay
Only the 1% really benefited big: 83 billion dollar gift to them. The rest got a pittance and now owe a huge debt that we’ll pass onto generations to come. Selfish!

Hey Mitch, BLOW ME!
Why are you so scared of Mueller? 

Hillary wasn’t afraid of being investigated. 

What are you hiding? 

Why are most ofvyou Republicans so scared?
What a scam. Brought to to you by old thieves who will be wearing drool bibs...at best, in 2025, when the scam REALLY nails middle class. GFY.
And...you sure don't mind a russian asset in the American White House. Of course, you helped install the fraud.
Sen. McConnell to Fox News on bill to protect Special Counsel Mueller that the Judiciary Committee plans to vote on in the next two weeks: "We'll not be having this on the floor of the Senate." (h/t @nielslesniewski)
yes yes keep reminding everyone who is responsible


Don’t forget....Huge deficit and debt too!  Nothing is free.
Deficit Explosion brought to you by the GOP economic terrorists .
Thank you Mr leader... now our wall
Money laundering day is every day though, amirite
You're hoping he gets fired before your crimes are revealed. That ship's sailed
Here is Mitch McConnell saying he will not permit a Senate floor vote on the bipartisan bill now moving through Senate Judiciary Committee that would heighten protections against Trump forcing an arbitrary firing…
The 1%-ers thank you, @SenateMajLdr McConnell! 
Hey why don't corporations like GE pay any taxes at all?
Are you taking ownership of these huge deficits you're running up too, or are you going to blame poor people again and try and cut Medicaid and SS... As if I need to ask...

Happy Tax Day, everyone! 

This is your friendly reminder that the president doesn’t want anyone to ever see his tax returns because he’s a criminal and a fraud.
They also bring you all the debt that goes with it.
