Hey stupid, your #TaxScam is trending oh so poorly these days. Seems 3/4 of citizens think it’s a raw deal. Thanks for reminding us who inflicted it upon us.
Tax reform is working for the American people? You mean the American people will be working to pay off your HUGE debt for the rest of their lives
A new plan better for all Americans! No more Tax Days!
You all really put the screws to the small business didn't you?  As long as the corporations get their money.  I know you are betting that Republicans will retain control and people won't figure it out until after the election. at which point you will cry "its the dems fault!"
Yeah, the new tax plan gives MY money to your RICH friends.
Just more lies from the RCE Republican Criminal Enterprise of the United States!
Yup and remember people the few bucks you might get are going to cost you,your children and grandchildren thousands of dollars to pay back the nation debt that GOP have added to enrich themselves with the this tax cut
McConnell is worse than trump
Trump is unfit pathological liar
@SpeakerRyan  @HouseGOP  @SenateGOP  @NancyPelosi  @SenatorSchumer The GOP is going all out on "tax day" in support of their tax scam act and new IRS items. They wouldn't be coordinating a diversion would they? Nah!

BS helps only the rich robs the country  out w the GOP
Out with the old senators/ house reps in with the new
MAGA
DUMP McCONNELL
Corporations MADE OUT!  Well, of course they did! Didn't need the help though.
UBER RICH made out! Well, of course they did! Didn't need the help though.
Middle class healthcare still under attack - Well, of course it is! 
Vote GOP out!
Lying hypetcrit
It's working for the rich American people.
Didn’t think I’d get an answer
History already loathes you.
Shame on you #TaxScamBill
I bet you don't pay taxes lying hypetcrit
Thanks for taking away the few deductions I used to have. Don’t you dare start calling for a balanced budget now! You took the tax revenue from corporations away, and expect the middle class to make up the difference.
My pay check went up by a bigly $16 a month, that's a tremendous $192 a year. I can't thank you enough for this huge pay raise. Don't let those naysayers bring you down off your high horse by mentioning the 1.2 trillion dollar deficient you created.
Let's wait and see the fruit first, then we'll know if it's a bad or good one. Stop blowing the trumpet, it'll make a bad result hard on you
It’s working for the rich. Stop trying to play us.
Repeal the $1.5Trillion tax cut for the wealthy that adds $1.5 Trillion to our deficit. Adding debt for future generations is not good stewardship.  Support fair taxation - flat tax for wages above $75,000.  @SenateGOP @SenateDems
TAX SCAM courtesy of the GOP!  
There’s no way to know how devastating the #GOPTaxScamBill will be to middle class America until we live with it for a year and really, only after we file our 2018 taxes. Don’t let @gop use the money you see in your paychecks sway you that they really care. #BlueWaveIsComing
@realDonaldTrump We know you are actually broke supported by money laundering foreign banks, but release the tax returns so we can see the evidence.
Looks like Americans reject the new.
No. It's the end of fiscal responsibility.  Your fault.  I'm sure you and the rest of your kind will profit greatly.  Where can supporters of the #IDIOT spend all those rubles?  Also, anyone over 70 should not serve.  You are out of touch with The Majority who hate all of you.
Guess you’ve chosen to ignore all the polls showing your #TaxScam is deeply unpopular. 
Will end up screwing the American people while the richest of the rich reap the benefits
We’ll be putting it back soon enough, Turtle.
I am convinced after doing my taxes this year that I will have to pay more-without a raise next year. I just paid $ in my taxes, hurt as I had to use a credit card next , meanwhile the super wealthy got $$ next year will be worst as most deductions have been removed in NY. MAGA?
BS
And with your new tax code, Republicans have screwed 99% of the American people. You don’t represent us. You represent your big donors. US citizens essentially now have “taxation without representation”. Does that phrase ring a bell?
We’ve seen $6 billion in bonuses versus more than $170 billion in  stock buybacks, that is, handing money to wealthy stockholders. Money  spent on buybacks is money that isn’t being invested in plants and equipment, the supposed point of the tax cut. This failed to buy votes.
Lies
When did the meaning of “21st century tax code” get changed to “Welfare for the Wealthy”?
You are a joke.
Now we ‘get to’ file under a seriously flawed one that will hurt the middle class and increase the deficit. I’m sure your paycheck went up more than mine went down. I suggest you invest your increase wisely. You probably won’t have this job for long.
#RINO
America's "brand-new 21st century tax code" is still double-taxing the defenseless, unrepresented abroad, just it has been doing so for the past 150 years. #TaxReform is actually working against the American people abroad. #TaxDay #FATCA #TTFI
Turkey.
Glad you are thinking that way, Mr. McConnell.  The time has come for the people of Kentucky.  Out with the old, and in with the new.
Great - my accountant says we will owe more now. Stick it to the middle class motto. Give free write-offs for big business for the trickledown nonsense theory. The top 1% hurray!!
#TaxScam is a turd sandwich. You’re gonna pay in November
Your billionaire friends must be celebrating
Kill us with a smile.
Since you don't pay taxes and have your money offshore, why are you playing this fake card?  You do not care, one iota, about the taxpayers of this nation.
While Americans living abroad do live "offshore", they actually bank locally and pay their local taxes.  Sadly, US politicians are still wrongly harming them with #FATCA discrimination. #TaxDay #TaxReform
I'm not a multi-millionaire so you new tax cuts won't help me. My taxes will go up to pay for your tax cut.
Your job is to push for the impeachment of the president. People are starting to think that you're afraid of being in implicated in his crimes.
The new plan makes you wealthier but it fails the middle class.  #TaxScam
You did nothing except make fat cats wealthier.  Shame on you.
You increased the deficit and American children and grandchildren (including yours) has to foot the bill for trillions of dollars.

But you still haven't fixed the infrastructure and invested in basic research and technology to prepare us for the 21st Century.
Yes! And we are thrilled! But, please keep pushing SUPPORT for POTUS’ agenda & focus on rescinding PP & sanctuary city funding to start, then Ocare $ to insurance lobby! You know u only need 51 votes to rescind! PUSH FIGHT WIN for us! The voters! Your base...it’s what WE want! TY
So happy for all you rich folks to save on your taxes. Me? Not so much 
POTUS doesn’t pay taxes. He’s bragged about it. @taxmarch
This is not reform, it is a travesty
Tax cuts for the rich aren’t reform
Dotard
A bunch of BS


The American people will vote in people to fix this disastrous, murderous tax/healthcare reform bill. #BlueWave2018
What@a@joke, pure garbage!
Your money grubbing donor overlords are so pleased. #TaxScam
Ond that doesn't do anything for the little guy or single person.
DICTATORS of the world -THE CONGRESS IS MINE !
They Bend to MY WILL !!

More $$$ for the wealthy !  Sanctions rolled back !

Now will you accept me in the DICKtator club?  I even have a HAT !!

#TheResistance

Can't wait to pay more so rich old farts can pay so much less.
What will you do about the trillions in new debt?
Until 2018 Blue Wave hits because you people didn’t have the balls to put country before party! #ImpeachmentNow #trump #BlueWave2018
Question for you, I am retiring, sold my main residence, plan on using the one time capital gains deduction for $250,000. Is that still going to be available to me?
dotcha just HATE it when autocorrect changes rich,
 to American?
And the rich get richer
Now we get the new tax code that gives lots of breaks to people at the top along with the sops to the rest, about which you consistently say nothing.  But Out of Sight, Out of Mind is not an option for current GOP/Trumplandia, we're going to follow the affects of your policies
Hope we can repeal this abomination when you are voted out.
New tax code, spiraling deficits. Great job Mitch. The next recession will be your legacy.
Liar

How many TRILLIONS does this add to the deficit? 2 or 3? Thanks for the $2.07 more a week in my paycheck! If McD's didn't make me sick-I'd get a whole meal deal!
Must explain those poll numbers.

#notoGOPtaxdeformity.
Jut stop! You have nothing to brag about. KY is too expensive anymore. Higher insurance, decreased wages, tax break is meaningless.





And a brand new Congress and Senate that actually listens to the voters and not the highest bidder. You know where the door is, don't let the doorknob hit you where the good lord split you.
#BlueWaveIsComing #VoteThemOut2018 #votebluebetrue
The very little so called tax benefit?  Higher gas, high housing higher groceries.  Equates to ..much less in my pay check
Tax cuts for the rich only!

Bahahaha Didn’t you see the news? Only 27% approve of the tax law!






Yes you and your cronies did this Mitch. Now watch the country go further into debt, the economy tank, and hard working Americans paying more in taxes. You did this as a payoff to all those fat cats who ponied up the big bucks to support your campaigns. And you’re proud?
Mitch you are Dumb Donnie’s bitc4. How does that feel?  You and Donnie scammed us all. Except of course you and the rest of the 1%. The rest of us get saddled with 1.5 trillion dollars of more debt that our poor and middle class children will struggle to pay off. Traitor.
Indeed, with a 21st century orgy of debt.
I hope you enjoy counting your bars of gold while the rest of us are looking for 2nd and 3rd jobs to make ends meet.
From then on the middle class will be truly fucked.
Maybe 21st century tax code, but social policies straight out of mid 20th century when white males held all power & privilege.
We still get Fu**ed! Thanks got nothing
You mean for corporations...
Minor edit; "working for the VERY RICH American people." Actually, that's a major edit.
You monster. My taxes will go up.
Tax Scam TRAITOR
Donald "TRAITOR" Trump " and ass-licker McConnell deflect and bully all day.  No one is forgetting your racism,  sexual perversions, or criminality!

Yeah, great. Now get all those judges, ambassadors, etc. confirmed. What’s the damn delay?
Excellent suggestion and question.
Tax cuts for the average American are small, many will pay more tax April 2019 unless they adjust their W4. Tax cuts for corporations have spurred consolidation rather than hiring and investment. Long-term effect will be more concentration of wealth and political power at the top
Brand new...
Thanks for the trillions in debt as you line your pockets. #corrupt #TaxCutsForTheRich
FU
Eat shit Turtle.
I can't wait to get my TurboTax version of the postcard 1040. I bet we will still need to have all of the data that we had before.
#TaxScam is more accurate
#turtleMcconnell is the main thing that’s “old and outdated” in this tweet.
Hmmmm...we shall see next year how much you screwed your supporters...
Yeah next year we lose the ability to write off our healthcare costs and in many cases our mortgage interest. No worries the rich can buy all they want through their businesses and write it all off. Thanks mitch, may you and your cronies get all that they deserve.
"Today is the last tax day to file. Our new scam will take effect - hold onto your wallets" McConnell translation
Riiight

Now you will burden fixed income seniors with much higher insurance costs as you have STOLEN BILLIONS from Medicare & Social Security payroll taxes

Just to pay off your top 1%

GOP HATES SENIORS

Out with the old in with the new???
The MAJOR BENEFICIARIES of which are the 1% and Corporations, thank you for #GOPTaxScam  @SenateMajLdr  @SpeakerRyan  and @POTUS
Low and middle class pay more.

Wealthy and 1% pay less.

GOP way, Weasel Mitch.
GOP obstruction of tussian sanctions say it all. VOTE WaPo: Trump hasn't signed off on Russia sanctions Haley announced
Oh yeah really terrific. My accountant already sent me estimates tax payment coupons - my taxes are going up exponentially. I miss the outdated code already.
Sure thanks, I only wish that I was a rich person to be the beneficiary of the tax cut, or that I owed a multinational company to increase its stock value by repurchasing outstanding shares; pennies for the rest of us!
Middle class Americans will find out at the end of the year that the GOP tax cut does nothing for them. The “extra” money they are seeing in paychecks now will be due right back to the feds at tax time. IRS tables are wrong. That why they say to “check ur deductions.” SCAM!
We do agree on something... “Out with the old “ #Resist 
So how much #tax does #Apple & #Amazon pay?

#GOPTaxScam
And the last time a great many taxpayers can claim their FULL SALT deductions
But hey, at least @realDonaldTrump his family, the 1% and Big Corps. got their big benefits of the Terrible Tax Bill
Right @SenateMajLdr ?
BTW, U will be Senate Minority Leader after Nov.2018 Elections
History repeating itself:

You mean the taxscam that 72% of the taxpayers not see shit!!!

Except those in your state?
Working so well (sic).
Too bad most Americans may save $60.00 and in a few years pay more. Understand you will save the and your wealthy supporters save millions
Tax scam
That’s good. Now let’s build the wall we were promised!
The only people the "tax reform" is working for is the wealthy. Hope you enjoyed your ride as it's coming to an end.
REPUBLICAN LIE REPUBLICAN B S LYING REPUBLICAN CRIMINAL.
Yea its screwed up and worse...thanks for that..maybe next time take a few minutes before shoving it through in the middle of the night...
#GOPTaxScam #CorruptGOP #DitchMitch #BlueWaveIsComing2018 #BlueWaveIsComing #BlueWave2018
In a way, I'm glad you won't stop talking about the #TaxScam.  When it implodes, we won't stop reminding you of it. The Blue Wave will realign your giveaways to the rich.
Sure not working for us yet.
Brand new tax code to make the rich richer, the poor poorer and make the middle class pay for it all
And now the reality of your bogus plan will begin to manifest itself and the middle class will experience the biggest rip off of all time
Liar, liar.
#TaxReform is working for the rich.
Russian sanctions? Anyone? Anyone? #PutinPuppet
It will be repealed.
Out with the old and in with the new ? Are you announcing an impeachment and your upcoming retirement?
If it's working so well, why do you have to keep selling all of us on it?

#TrumpTaxScam

#FireHannity
You kept the same loopholes in the code so corps can keep dodging tax OBLIGATIONS!

Additionally, the tax relief for citizens has already begun its declining slope to non-existence in 2025.

Of course, when the import tariffs jack-up inflation, we will have lost all gains.
#WeTheTaxpayers challenge YOU to read thru these replies....THIS IS OUR AMERICAN VOICE...#prettysad. #GOP have a huge credibility problem
Our extra $46/month is a game changer for sure.  Yippee! Good times again! Bam!
The new tax code is unpopular with the people and will go down as a shameful disaster in history.  Kissing the donor class ass.
Mitch, ask @seanhannity about this the next time you're on FOX news.
Representatives of President Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen named Fox News host Sean Hannity as his third client after a federal judge ordered disclosure. Hannity has denied that Cohen represented him in…

You screwed us already with tax reform and your crazy budget for billionaires. Why do you keep rubbing it in our faces?
Eh, not really.  The old code still exists, and the “new” code didn’t actually make things any simpler.  Our deficit is sure to spiral out of control faster though.
