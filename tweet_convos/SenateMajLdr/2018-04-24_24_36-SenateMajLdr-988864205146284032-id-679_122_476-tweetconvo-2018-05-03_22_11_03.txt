Mitch you need to do more, can’t just settle for this tax cuts etc. help this POTUS quit fighting against him! We all know what ur doing
#GOPTaxScam
All your campaign donors and their money won't make any difference if America hate you
Oh yeah, the deficit is blown up and markets are down for the year. Regular people see an extra $20 A check and the donor class gets millions in savings. What great policy.
Market from 18,000 to 24,000 since elections day Nov 2016. If you can read. Obama 8 Year budget debt from 12 Trillions to 19 Trillions again if you can read & research with all due respect MAGA
I guess the real test on whether it’s working will be found out in November
Why do you guys so happy about getting yourself money and stealing from the rest of America
Nope. Just the corporations


I'm still waiting for any explanation of why so many in the Trump campaign were meeting Russians. Why? "It's not illegal" doesn't put me at ease as a plausible explanation. https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/990168776808255488 …

Don’t forget @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader and @SenateMajLdr ‘s distain for the disabled. They are actually going to kill off as many disabled people as they can with their #TaxCutsandJobsAct #taxreform …
More #McConnellLIES 
Job growth is DOWN
Stock market DOWN
#TaxCutsandJobsAct is a FAILURE according to numerous Republicans & they blame you & Ryyan

 THANKS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP POLICIES TAX REFORM
 IS WORKING FOR AMERICA 

#TaxCutsandJobsAct

@SenateFloor @HouseFloor
Yeah right, this is the reason Dems didn’t back it.  Your #TaxReform is bankrupting our country.

Great Constipator! WHY aren't you bringing bills to the floor that WILL PASS BY BOTH PARTIES?
SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP!
IF NOT, YOU NEED TO GO
Evidence? CBO says we're on track to hit *deficits* of $1 trillion. Deficits, not debt.

LYING AS USUAL
#GOPTaxScam has directly led to corporate stock buyouts, layoffs and companies moving to Mexico.
Impact of #GOPTaxScam. Multinational company Philips Lighting announces $342M profits in 2017 & $187.4M in planned share buybacks in 2018. Immediately lays off nearly 200 Fall River workers and moves factory to Mexico. https://twitter.com/bostonherald/status/988820648293208065 …
Can you provide any evidence it is working for working Americans?
Lie!
Yes, the diverging paths of cruelty and compassion. U & Ur cult have definitely clarified which path U & the @GOP have chosen. #legacyofobstructionanddestruction


in 2018, new tax-cut gives top 1% average of $4,261 per month

it gives bottom 20% of earners an average of $5 per month…

Get off your mountain and come down to the real world. Your so called tax cut only benefits you, your cronies and the big buck contributors to your political world.

Please provide names and facts and details on individual U.S.taxpayers who have benefited beyond a one time $100 or $1000.00 ONCE ONE TIME ONLY vs. corporate buybacks....
Love it, now let’s get the tax revision done from the House and cut unnecessary spending!
At least for the old, rich, white guys!
Working? Yeah to blow up the debt
How is it working? It’s done nothing for me.
Oh, plz. 566 days  in office. I"be got MS and I did more than you!
You & @RepAndyBarr are enriching the wealthy and large corporations via PERMANENT tax cuts (using tax cuts for stock buybacks) vs. small TEMPORARY tax cuts for Middle Class and Working Poor. Chuck Eddy Moderate Republican for Congress against Barr in Republican Primary May 22nd.

Mitch, the more you say it still doesn't make it true. Whatever benefits might have accrued to the average American have been more than offset by increasing prices for gas, food and housing. Why not concentrate on things that benefit the many, not the already rich.
Is it though? Let’s assume it is. Is it working for MOST people? How about our schools and infrastructure? How about our national debt? Small government only works if you ACT like a small government.  You can’t give big tax breaks and up spending.
right.  my 401k is so much better because of you and trump  #NOT
Your 100% right on this one... The GOP has diverged to try and create a ruling aristocracy in America by funneling the nation's wealth into their pockets while Democrats have worked to support the working class citizens who bear the burden of all the actual labor. #trickledownbs
.@SenateMajLdr Big surprise. It turns out alot about the tax cuts is a lie. Here are some of the most egregious claims: 

Why not be truthful @SenateMajLdr?

#GOPTaxScam #GasLighting #TheResistance
Yes it is, with 83% of the benefits of the Tax "Reform Package" going to the top 1%, Democrats would have increased benefits to the working class and not given any benefits the wealthiest 1%! 2019 begins an endless stream in trillion dollar deficits now.
.@SenateMajLdr it's a #GOPTaxScam and nothing more and what's sick is that you know it
#TaxReform helps the wealthy at the expense of the poor and middle class
Have you checked the prices at the gas station or grocery stores? This is a joke. The poor and middle class that you # now have to pay thru the nose as prices leap. Got that? You won. We did not. I hope you come for reelection soon.
Tax scam only benefits the 1% and real people are going to freak out next year when they owe all that extra money to IRS
Shouldn't you be off eating a baby or something?
Pretty sure I didn't get a tax cut. But then I'm not rich. You know, the 1% are not the only "American People".  They're just the only ones YOU care about because they are the ones lining your pockets.
Average Joe is keeping about   .48 more an hour based on a 40 hour work week thanks to the #GOPTaxBillScam. 

The Kochs are saving $1 bil. per year. $480,769 an hour based on a 40 work week. 

That’s $32. Every second.24 hours a day. 7 days a week. 365 days a year.
 #BlueTsunami
Does that make the Kochs 230,769 times more important than the average American? Apparently it does to the @GOP cronies. #Resistance #BlueWaveComing2018
Liar.
Your tax reform only works for the rich.
That diverging began when you swore to make 44 a one term president.   We middle class,  now suffer under your pettiness.
Republican tax scam
Impact of #GOPTaxScam Phillips Lighting brass called a meeting on 4/20/18 telling the workers the facility was being shuttered and 160 workers, including 97 union workers and management, were losing their jobs To Mexico!
The passage of the historic #TaxCutsandJobsAct was just the latest illustration of the diverging paths Republicans the people of the USA envision for the U.S.

#TaxReform is working for the Corporations of America

Dems just won a seat in NY Republicans have held since 1978. #DemWave 
How’s the debt?
Bullshit, I'm haven't seen any increase in my paycheck, but then again my income isn't 6 figures.

Love Mitch..
You will go down as the leader who added fuel to the divide in America instead of healing
Make it permanent NOW. Save your party coward.

Democrats are proud of this divergence
Well Sir, the tax cuts sure were a boon to corporations. It’s a good thing corporations are people now!
Also, I’m Tired Of U Damn GOP Leaders Sticking Ur Heads In The Sand & Are No Where To Be Found, When Controversy’s Arise! What Do U Have To Say About Trump Appointee Mick Mulvaney? It’s Time For U To Go! #VOTETHEMOUT
Wow. Mick Mulvaney told a bunch of bankers today that he and members of Congress are corrupt. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/mulvaney-consumer-financial-protection-bureau.html … 
That’s NOT What The CBO Says! I Suggest EVERYONE Go & Read What The CBO Projections, For Their Tax Bill Will Be! They Say In Just 2 Years, We Will Be In A HUGE DEFICIT! They Say, Because Of The Tax Bill & The Omnibus Bill, A Trillion Dollar Deficit Will Be Added Each Year! #LIARS
Crying McConell- absolutely agree, The Tax Deficit & Jobs Cuts bill takes us down the path to Oligarchs, outdated infrastructure, poorly educated citizens, people sick from air they breathe and water they drink, and no health care.  Dems are the reverse path! Catch the wave!
Those glasses aren't helping you Mitch, as you continue to turn a blind eye towards Pruitt's criminal behavior.
EPA Head Scott Pruitt Allegedly Got Another Sweetheart Deal on Another Lobbyist's House
"One Dollar a Year Salary" for any public servant after "12 Years". Pass this and you'll go down in American History books.  M.A.G.A.
Yes, Tax Reform is working for most of the American people but YOU are not. Quit and help make America great again."TERM LIMITS"
How is it helping? Have you gone to the grocery stores or gas pumps? You didn't think that tax reform was free did you? Those millions of us that didnt get a reform pay for those that did. Bs
Such verbal diarrhea from a complete turd.
That's true.
Had you allowed Obama's tax reform law 8 years ago, or invited Dems to this bill, it would have truly benefited middle class.
Rather the #GOPTaxScam is a $1T give-away to the wealthy and corporations that buy GOP elections with #darkmoney 
#GOP path is #Corruption
#Scam
If by ¨working¨, you mean the middle class is getting a $1.50 a week payraise, while corporations and ppl like Trump kids got Billions in tax breaks, well yes. By all means, it´s working!  ¡¿Yeay?!
SenateMajLdr ignores the trillions of dollars from super rich & corporations tax cuts added to the national debt.  The GOP scam to take Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security monies & burden the Middle class w/more taxes to pay back the burden of our national debt from tax cuts.@CNN
Hahahaha lying Mitch the obstructionist a fake leader.
Talk with your friends on the other side and start putting Trumps picks THROUGH. SPEAK TO THEM NOW.
The reason for the divergence is because your tax plan is an economic disaster.
Along with ripping away consumer protections, just another way to line your pockets at our expense...you are the Senate Majority Scam Leader...
Your #TaxScam was a giveaway to the most wealthy, your donors (Koch brothers), and corporations. Americans are not confused about this.
Not for my tax bracket.
#TaxScam
Working for Americans?
You mean the rich ones, right?
Sure........reinvesting in companys
                   Payouts to stockholders 
We proved in the ‘80s that trickle down doesn’t work
Do you know what the minimum wage is?
History will not be kind to you.....

See! I knew it!


https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2018/4/24/17275720/pass-throughs-tax-cut-bill …
Your tax cut is unnecessary, throws a massive deficit and you fuckers don’t even give a damn. Damn your tax cut and damn your deficits. The GOP has shown for the second time that it is truly the party of deficits.
Republicans need to hire a great PR firm to provide strong messaging on tax cuts.
How about getting rid of Obamacare?
NCR laying off 1000+ jobs in Columbus GA to move them overseas. Yeah, your tax cuts worked. #TakeTheMoneyAndRun
We know that but WHY are you not forcing the POTUS nominees to be confirmed this is shameful and dealing with DACA we are sick and tired of this obstruction in both sides!!
Agreed.....however to keep the majority you must message this better and you must repeal Obamacare and get all the President’s nominees in place and please stop funding Planned Parenthood I don’t want my tax dollars to go to an organization that gives millions to the Dems
Except for the big increase in the deficit that will limit our flexibility in the next recession 
Thank u 4 d 13 trillion deficit n 4 making d poor poorer n d rich richer
It has been proven time and time again, in state after state, tax cuts tank government ability to pay for necessary services. A little research shows, higher taxes, better economy, lower debt and no deficit. Small minds running the WH and Congress.
I don' t know what Americans you aree talking about....

No one I know has seen any help from your tax & job

Its all a crock of shit
No #TaxReform is definitely not working for working people, it's working for the ritchest and corporations only. You shifted taxes from working Americans to the wealthy, how does this make sense? Who is going to buy their products now that we have less to spend? 1.9 T deficit!!!!
Republicans see themselves & the rich with huge tax breaks & Democrats see  the rest of us being scammed. You are all self-serving  &  could care less about the rest of us.  We see through your lies.
Stock market down, gas prices up, interest rates rising, huge debt!! GOOD JOB!!!
Hasn’t done a thing for me.  I am an American person. How is that 2-trillion in debt working out? How about if you want your mortgage deduction you can keep it? To quote a Republican, you lie!
Mitch why don't you get out of the West Virginia primaries and use the funds that were sent to you to do good in the general election for the Senators that need it

#MoreTrumpJudgesNow

Until you get this under control you ain't done squat. In fact, this admin has added two trillion.....thats trillion, in less than a year. Stop patting yourselves on the back and do fiscally conservative things.
Mitch, please retire!

OMG! Just STOP already! NON-STOP PROPAGANDA & LIES! Don't believe a word of it. Their CONSTANT plugging & cheer-leading should tell you how much of a Middle Class FAILURE this Tax SCAM truly is. HERE is the TRUTH! This Tax SCAM will KILL the Middle Class!
This millionaire revealed his tax return to show just how much the GOP tax law favors the rich 
The Republican path is to feudalism and slavery. The Democratic path is to freedom.
For 1% of us!! Smoke and mirrors is your specialty.
Your Tax Reform Sucks. $8.00 weekly increase after taxes. How much did you get?
For the rich.....
Now use the rules to correct that over blown budget down to size!  The Democrats would do it in a heart beat!
Fake news
Not really understanding the “and Democrats” portion of your statement considering you didn’t get one Democrat vote on the Trump tax cuts. Please call it like it is.
And old Bernie still wants to spend tax payer money to the max by promising #government jobs to everyone with $15p/hr minimim, free college, etc. Democrats have lost their minds! @GOP @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan
No, Mitch. You screwed the people and only helped your rich friends.
How come I don’t feel tax reform working for me?
Statement One: True.                                Statement Two: Also true if you define “people” as corporations and the one percent.
Working? No. 
Republicans on a diverging path? Yes. @GOP is diverging from democracy.
White Privilege College & high school children. Look how you're being brainwashed by terrorists. They have brainwash you to use Hitler's agenda. You're their Nazis. Look what happens when you don't convert to Sharia law. Genocide! This is not from God! SL is the 666. 
Islam is
I'm doing the Lord's work. God did'nt put ppl on this  for other ppl to genocide. Damascus: are terrorist waiting for Muhammad & your Allah to come bk after Jigs genocide everyone that don't convert to Sharia law! Ppl are being genocide b/c of SL. Islam is not SL . Islam is .
It’s working, huh? How come only 27% of Americans support it?  You guys keep touting it because you’re afraid to admit your signature legislation is a big flop with the public.
Trillion dollar debt.
Mandatory Tax Withdrawal from her IRA (Pension Funds went into)  That money was already taxed when earned. If she doesn't take it out The GOVERMENT takes half of what she was made to take. Some real Tax scam forced through Ryan got a half Million from the Kochs 13 Days afterward
No It Is Not,  The GOP  really pulled a fast one on the average person.  My 80 year old Mother shouldn't have to be paying taxes anymore. My step-dad served as a Merchant Mariner, worked over 40 years paid taxes on taxes. Why must an 80 year old widow pay taxes on Minimum Minimum
WRONG, not a divergent path. What the Dems want is to fundamentally change this country by radical legislation, unconstitutional actions, criminal activities. voter fraud, etc. THE REASON THEY GOT SO FAR IS YOU, GOP, IGNORED & JUST CALLED THEM ANOTHER FLAVOR
Why the hell are you talking for the democrats. Get trumps agenda done. Your leadership in the senate is killing the repub agenda.
Mitch, like Democrats have told you for years: deficits don’t matter.
I wouldn't call billionaires working people


Yes, the divergence between equity, decency, fairness, sanity, and the path you’ve chosen.  Resign.
When you talk, all I hear is Charlie Brown’s teacher...”Wah, wah, wah, waaaahhhh.”
all I hear is...."GIVE ME MONEY....GIVE ME MONEY....GIVE ME MONEY"
Yes, yes it is. It shows how morally repugnant Republicans have become and the utter disdain you have for your constituents.
We call it #BULLSHIT!!
No it’s not. Why do you lie so much? Does .@realDonaldTrump have a pretty tape OF YOU?
Liar
You guys need a new routine. This 80’s remix is stale.
No. No it’s not. #taxReform is a #sham
Stupid. Sycophant.
Really a-hole? How’s that stock market doing?
Bullshit!
Uh..... rich Americans Mitch!!  Rich Americans ...
I call BS
?????
As you should be. Pass some entitlement reform of Ryan’s or spending reform of Paul’s
