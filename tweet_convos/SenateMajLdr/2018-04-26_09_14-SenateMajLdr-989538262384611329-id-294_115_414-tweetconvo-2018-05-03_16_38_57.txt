I hope someone in the White House has vetted Grenell so we don't have a repeat of the RonnyJackson scandel. We used to have procedures.


I'm still waiting for any explanation of why so many in the Trump campaign were meeting Russians. Why? "It's not illegal" doesn't put me at ease as a plausible explanation. https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/990168776808255488 …
Is lying through his swamp monster teeth as he quietly helps democrats stop @realDonaldTrump agenda.along with @SpeakerRyan ! They need to be exposed and stopped!
Since your wife works for Trump, you should recuse yourself and let the Senate #ProtectMuellerNow.   

Or are you the manipulative p.o.s we all think you are; putting party before country and pocketing millions in the process?

Whooo whooo - the corrupt @GOP railroad of unqualified nominees continues to roll unchecked just like the ethics violations throughout 45's administration
why do you love greed?
Judging by the quality of @realDonaldTrump's other appointees, Grenell must be a Nazi.
How does Germany feel about that? Angela Merkel is not happy with our administration at this time. Trump is an embarrassment!

#singlefileMitch
Keep the Senators on the job until the job is done!!

#NuclearOption #GetItDone

Crying McConell- or instead U can bring the bipartisan bill to protect special counsel to a vote and stop end your lame GOP obstruction!
Trump said today at some point he’s going to interfere with justice Department, but you won’t protect Mueller! We have got to have a blue wave!

#DemandAVote
Allow the vote. You do not represent majority of Americans.
I will go cornhole Donald. Recess time
Are you still paying folks for retweets?
If the vote below happens, U might as well buy targets 2 wear behind your heads: "The Sen. Jud. Committee is set 2 vote on a bill which would effectively shield Spec. Counsel R. Mueller from being fired by the Justice Department."

America will be pissed!

Chlorpyrifos hurts the brain and lowers IQ, especially in kids, who also experience tremors due to the chemical. It's been linked to everything from cancer to Parkinson's.

Come January, Senator Senile, you will no longer be controlling individuals for nomination.
When will we get an ambassador to S. Korea?
And next I nominate @KanyeDoingStuff as my Secretary of All My One Black Friend...
I have already VETTED him...
@POTUS is TRULY degrading  and downgrading the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY !! AND YOU NEVER COMMENTED ABOUT IT. HOW ABOUT TALKING ABOUT IT AS THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER.
#ProtectMueller
Nope @SenGaryPeters @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
@SenateMajLdr - Do NOT allow the bill to “protect” Mueller to come to the Senate floor!! Special Counsels already DEFY our Rule of Law. This is outrageous!!! It is an attempted coup against @realDonaldTrump
Its early, we'll probably have 70 in this administration.
Good let’s get the rest confirmed as well
Obstruction King
#ReleaseTheText #NoRedactions
How about ambassadors to N Korea and Mexico?

More gutless nonsense from spineless GOP appeasers. https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/republicans-help-send-robert-mueller-protection-legislation-to-senate-floor …

Too bad y’all tried to destroy Jackson! You’re such a rino!
Now work 7 days until Gina Haspel is confirmed as the new CIA Director and all the lower court judges are confirmed!
Protect Mueller !!
Now onto the #ProtectMueller next @SenateMajLdr ! We demand it


VIDEO

"The mob takes the Fifth Amendment. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?” 
It’s about time! We proud Americans r tired of this nonsense in the senate taking so long to confirm nominees. Why don’t y’all work at least 5 days a week like most people! Also all repubs shld be 100% w/ President we ppl r! Do agenda!!
Damn McConnell now u only have 250 more to go at 30 hours each u'll be dead before ur half way there
All corrupt conservatives, such as yourself
Is he qualified? Not many of these Trump nominees are
About time! Democrats' obstruction is unprecedented and disrespectful to OUR country and OUR President!

How about using the nuclear option on the Obstructionist Democrats 
And then you’ll move on to the legislation that protects Robert Mueller, right?

This junk to protect mueller is wasting the people’s time and money. STOP THIS MADNESS.
Uncanny.
#DemandAVote
Draining the swamp went out the window with all of the ill qualified people that you support.  What happened to MAGA?
It would be nice if you would do something for Americans who  are not following blindly behind evil. Praying for you.

@SenateMajLdr is just another one of Putin’s puppets 
#CorruptGOP

Protect  mueller
What about the #protectMueller bill????
Bring a vote that prevents 45 from interfering in the Mueller investigation.
How about voting on the bill to protect special counsel? Or are you too bankrupt morally and afraid of our degenerate president. Never mind, I already know The answer.

But you won't allow a vote to protect the special counsel. Party over country, you're a disgrace.
And the other 1100+ Mitch?  How about earning that raise your crime organization voted in for themselves and work more than 3 days a week?  How about no more time off until they are all confirmed?  At this rate, 11 years is looking like your timeframe, which is ridiculous!
I want the bill to protect the special counsel voted on by MY elected representatives. Get out of the way and do your job.
But you won’t vote to protect Mueller. Are you on the RUSSIAN PAYROLL as well?
FINALLY!!! 
Well it's about time Mitch . How about the rest of the nominations it sure does look like the Democrats are running the Government  You do know that the Republicans are in charge  Why don't you keep all the employees in session till you get the job done That's what real people do
Well it's about time Mitch . How about the rest of the nominations it sure does look like the Democrats are in charge . You do know that the Republicans are in charge ? Why don't you keep all the employees in session till you get the job done. That's what real people do everyday
Protect Mueller!!
Great, keep voting. Make them stay until all of Pres. team and judges are approved. Make it happen!

Finally on R Grenell Senate needs to 5-6 days a week to clear out backlog!! That's what we do in the real world.
Thank you. Wish it had not have taken so long for Grenell. Keep moving forward.
Merick Garland?
Protect Mueller
What about the legislation to protect the Mueller Special Council?
ALLOW VOTE TO PROTECT MUELLER
Now, when is the vote on the Mueller Protection bill? #ProtectMueller
Really finally 
What took so long? Stay in session and get these nominees confirmed 
And what about a vote on the bill to protect the #russiagate investigation from interference by the @potus? Will that get a vote now that it's passed out of committee by a bipartisan vote of 14-7? Or will obstruct justice too?
Yeah no prob putting it on the floor if it’s your idea!
#wewillrememberinnovember
Protect Mueller
Allow the vote to protect #Mueller
#resign!
Protect the Mueller investigation or you are aiding Trump with whatever he is guilty of
Time for you to step aside & allow a full floor vote on bill protecting Mueller.  We know you are obstructing your own prosecution for conspiring w/ Russia. Do it anyway.
#DemandAVote #DemandAVote #DemandAVote #DemandAVote #DemandAVote #DemandAVote #DemandAVote #DemandAVote
About time! What good does this 30-hour rule do? Scrap it! Worried about losing the Senate? That's another incentive to fight like mad to keep the Senate.

#ProtectMueller 
#502 #40219

Allow the vote
We #demandavote to protect the special investigator, protect our democracy.
U say these things like some great compliment but the ambassador should have been approved year ago  stop going home stay in DC til all the appointments are confirmed.  And than the Dems will stop slow walking everything
Lookin forward to the moment AMERICA DUMPS YOU
How bout no one leaves until every single nomination is through??!!
Pompeo has been caught, yet again, lying about his business ties to China. How are you still moving forward with this confirmation? #GOPFail
The Senate majority leader doesn’t want to protect Mueller because he is involved in colluding with the Russians!  Why else wouldn’t he allow a bipartisan vote to #ProtectMueller
Bout damn time!!
That's great.
But it's sad to find out that our POTUS will be out of office before his cabinet is confirmed. Why do we pay you guys? What is it that you do?
Bring this to a vote immediately!!!!
Get it done. Get rid of RINOs.
WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND A VOTE TO #ProtectMueller
As for ambassador to Germany, just send the Presidents “special” advisor herr MILLER the neo Nazi. IT’ll CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MAN and SUPER CHARGE the Trump Base. “Ya know there are good people on both sides” The @GOP is going to implode with McConnell. He needs to go to pasture!!
Will you block the bipartisan bill to #ProtectMueller? Allow a vote!
Hopefully you “extreme vet” all of these folks. Trumps sure doesn’t.
We are the citizens of the United States of America. We are respectdully asking you to allow the vote to #ProtectMueller

You are OUR voice. Not Trumps. Do the job you were hired to do.
I say F the Especial Counsel! Stop being afraid of the f bolsheviks on the left! They are the real colluders. The real Russia lovers! They know Collusion is BS!
And why do we need a new Secretary of State? Because trump and the gop don't know how to lead. They love chaos so they can help the rich and divide this county. Do the honorable thing. Pass the bill to protect Mueller and then resign. You are part of the problem.
Don’t let Mueller be above the law!!! Why should we worry about Dems if we have all this rinos and traitors. Stop the Collusion BS! I swear to God we will vote till the last Rino out!!! #MAGA
How long will this disposable character last in this chaotic circus ( The White House )
When are you going to start using the nuclear option so the rest of the Presidents nominees can be put in place. The DEMOCRATS do it why are you not
So how will you work with the democrats and the true senate majority leader, Schumer, to delay and obstruct the latest list of nominees?
NEW: Trump's latest wave of judicial nominees. List includes three appeals court nominees: For the 4th Circuit, A. Marvin Quattlebaum (who was confirmed to a district judgeship under Trump) and Jay Richardson,…
Good news.  Now about those others that have been so long delayed....?
So now the HEAD SPOOK who spied on all these Countries, is going to be the HEAD diplomat to broker piece and understanding ???  Does this sound PUTIN-ish <——-Wasn’t that sorta kinda Putins career path with the Kremlin??? (KGB/Diplomat) ???
#NaziNominees
Just how complicit are you with Russia?
Is he qualified? If Trump picked him, probably not.
I hope he ready fo4 hard work and speak German and ready to know trust towards USA in germany is completely gone !! The people dont trust anymore . You attack Eu germany all things that Europe stand for.....  He will have a hard time here I hope he speak better then trump
Bring the bill to the floor to protect Mueller. It’s your duty! Simple!
Allow the vote to protect Robert Mueller and the special council!!! Stop obstructing justice and let the rule of law prevail!! #ProtectMueller
When are you going to protect Mueller? Most Americans support this.
#KEEPCONGRESSINSESSION
you forgot your oath!!!!
... and then we can get back to the Russian roulette game of who is next to get canned from the Cabinet or quit Congress.  What a shame you are one of the few Regressives still holding onto your government job.

Do your job sir. You start acting like a winner..... Chuck Schumer and dems seem to be acting like they are driving the agenda.....
About effin’ time.  

Why ought base vote GOP in 2018 if this #MAGA diffidence is all you give us?

You’ve got no answer, and hundreds of millions in ad spending won’t change that.
9 months? Why are you allowing this charade to continue?
Retire
Looks like the Dems are being cooperative.  How come you were not when you were the Minority Leader?

Now that the "Mueller Protection" bill passed in the Judiciary Committee @SenateMajLdr is set to halt its progress by not allowing a Senate floor vote. 
   
No vote means McConnell is a complicit Russian stooge!!
   
#McConnellisComplicit
You are Obstructing Democracy!Allow the vote to protect Robert Mueller! #DemandAVote
History will show that the Republican-led Sentate was Trump's rubber stamp! Don't feel badly about it because your House colleagues share the same title! Too bad that none of you dare show backbone and stand up to this dictator wannabe for what is good for America! HOW SHAMEFUL!
I'm thinking about becoming a lobbyist to further my agenda. How much money do I need to bring with me in order to receive an audience with you?
Here comes war with Iran But your super donor Sheldon Alderson has alreaqdy paid you the bribe for war with Iran A coward like Trump refused to serve but takes bribes to send our children to war
Europe will not follow just saying trust towards USA in germany is completely  destroyed!!  You attack Eu and everything Europe,germany  stand for !! He will have hard time
Obama had 2 SOS in 8 years. Think about that for a minute.
