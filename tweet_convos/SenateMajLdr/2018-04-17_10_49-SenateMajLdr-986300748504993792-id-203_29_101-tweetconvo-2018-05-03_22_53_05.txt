The jig is up, Mitch
Benefiting the rich American people
The people are ready for your derelict inaction Leader McConnell:

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …

will you protect Mueller??  How long before you show up in some investigation?  What is trump doing for you that wont simply protect Mueller.
GOP TAX SCAM!!!
What? More lies?  When are you gonna realize the gig's up?  You're just spreading more Trump propaganda and the public knows it!
How about discussing WHY YOU WONT #ProtectMueller ? 
If you think this administration is innocent then #ProtectMueller !
If you know they are guilty #ProtectMueller ! 
What's stopping you ? 
Something is. 
WUSS ! #ProtectMueller !
#FirePruitt & #ImpeachTrump ! 
Shame on the GOP !
Lies and deciet!

I’ll be busy.
Mitch cannot support Mueller because his wife is in Trumps Administration. So little Mitch has to be a good boy and stay silent. I am sure he has been given Russian support also. Another dirty Republican. Trump has shown the whole world just how low and dirty R’s  are.


Just a thought...if you are so proud of it, why don’t you appear on a legitimate news show?
And what are you going to do about #debt?
They will cut Medicare, Medicaid and steal from Social Security!  
Bla bla bla Mitch. You got nothing..

Shame on you! Save Mueller! What will you do when Drumpf fires him?

I lost my civility months ago, now I just rail obscenities at the ignorance of it all
I’m right there with you, Beth. The entire administration and Congress are a complete dumpster fire.
and bringing back the trillion dollar deficit.....  sad
This is a lie. I am a KY physician. The horrific #GOPTaxScam has harmed every employee, raised our practice taxes, and raised the owner;s taxes by raising the brackets and destroying our deductions. Our CPA is appalled at how awful your tax bill is
Protect Special Counsel Mueller.
Propagandist
Was anyone confirmed to the @POTUS admin?
and please explain why sanctions against Russia are STILL not implemented.
TRILLIONS more in debt-what public service cuts will be proposed to offset deficits? Programs for disabled or abused kids? Battered women? Cop training? Schools? Feeding poor? Driving Seniors further into poverty? GOP got theirs!
It is not benefitting the American worker.  Get your head out of the sand!

Zzzzzzz
More lies

Today Trump Said Nick Haley was wrong. US is FOLLOWING Putins orders! 
COLLUSION  or a PUPPET or both
Putin said US should NOT IMPOSE sanctions.
NICKI HALEY announced Sanctions.
Trump said she was wrong.
Talk about the deficits and how we will be paying them for generations

You going to use yourself as an example? Will you discuss how much *Typical Family of four* needs to be earning in order to obtain the touted average of $2056 a year?
False gloating.
More important things going on that you have chosen to ignore.  You will all be voted out. You are complicit with the loss of our democracy by ignoring the horrific swamp.
Make sure you have a shot or 6 of whisky before you go on. We know that’s where your courage comes from.
You’re a liar  #ResignNow
Roads falling apart. Bridges ready to collapse. Deny good & medical to poor. Schools using 30 yr old textbooks. All so your rich donors can get richer! Trillions in debt. GOP brings shame to Nation!
Guess we'll have to wait for you to join the Trump team! Newsflash... you're not President!
McConnell is a “tools tool”!!
GOP pushing the TAX BREAK for BILLIONAIRES.
They're going After SENIORS & Social Security to pay for it!
Pha-Q
mrealDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP

Here is who benefits the most
Fox News = Sexual Predator Network 
Surprised you're not appearing on Hannity.
Oh please! Retire, Mitch!

So you will be lying and talking about taxation without representation? What about dealing with republican corruption? Examples would be Pruitt and Zinke both breaking the law? What happened to your spine? At this point you are just taking up space and oxygen.
We need that oxygen now more than ever thanks to Pruitt. I remember driving through Cleveland and not being able to see through the polluted air. Beautiful to see Progressive Field now. Pretty soon we won't be able to see again. Great news!
Somebody crack this turtles shell already
This is what NOT LYING to your constituents looks like.
A wall would benefit us , too


Scheduled for 4:00-4:01 slot.


You need to be working instead of constantly trying to blow yourself.  You're going to break your arm patting yourself on the back.
You’re nauseating.
So like,  it'll be over at 4:01?

Resign already. You're a fossil
How about discussing our colluding President and complicit Congress

A false @SenateMajLdr going to a false “news” to spread falsehoods. At least you are consistent.
If you don’t get rid of gilsbuster 60 vote nothing will get done unless you give away house like in spending bill.  Majority won is 51 votes not partisan political obstruction 60. Give MAGA a chance. Listen to the people for once.  @SpeakerRyan @VP @POTUS
Mitch has no credibility. Sad! #VoteThemOut #VoteBlue2018
BTW: Tell @POTUS to show us his taxes.  I know he is so "smart" he prolly doesn't pay much but, we still want to have a quick look ;-)
So you're going on a Liar show to lie more lies. Got it.
I can’t tell you how excited I am about missing this. 28 weeks until the mid terms. After that about all you’ll be able to pass is gas.
The typical middle class American is paying a higher percentage of his or her income in taxes than is the typical multi-millionaire or billionaire American. The Trump-Republican tax act will make this even worse, starting this tax year. #GOPTaxBillScam
We crunched the numbers and our taxes will increase by $4,500 next year because of the GOP tax plan. I am a TV editor and my wife is a pediatrics intensive care nurse. 1 child. I'd say, "Thanks for nothing," but it's worse than nothing. #GOPTaxScam #GOPTaxBillScam
#GOPTaxScam #taxday
@realDonaldTrump today is a good day to show you tax returns. Senator McConnell why are you not asking that.
That extra $6.51 a week buys an extra bowl of gruel each day... Thank you, Guvnah...!

Stormy Daniels reacts to Pres. Trump's denial he knew anything about $130,000 payment made to her: "I work in the adult business and I'm a better actor than he is." http://abcn.ws/2CcjBVI  
Tax scam for the rich. We are not fooled by your lies. Big corporations love it, the little folks get screwed!
And we'll share a nice big bottle of Koch together.
know this new tax law did not help me, a single woman, who has a successful psychotherapy practice.
Can you provide the proof of who and how they are seeing these benefits? Your claim that 4,000,000 + (and counting) are already seeing the benefits is a little hard to believe. Where are your numbers and information coming from. You can't just say sometbing as fact w/o evidenvce.


Is Michael Cohen your lawyer too @SenateMajLdr ?  #DitchMitch
Why dont you PROTECT our tax dollars like you do your personal bank account and make sure ILLEGALS DONT VOTE and our Tax Dollars are not wasted on them!
Will you be demanding that Trump releas his tax returns? Will you release yours?
It's only benefiting the UBER wealthy but good luck with your LYING PR Stunt.
Well...some more than others lol
Are you going to talk about why only 27% think the law is good and benefits them? Or of course blame it on Hillary and the Democrats?

How convenient. Going on FauxNews where unsuspecting Americans are trained to believe anything they hear. More FakeNews propaganda spewed forth by people who have no respect for truth, honesty, integrity, journalism and now, even the rule of law is under attack. #BoycotFoxNews
are you American @SenateMajLdr?
Resign Turdle
Under the new code:   The deficit is through the roof.

80% of the economic gain will go to foreign investors. 

Only 4% of F500 companies used their tax savings for raises / bonuses for regular workers.  Stock buybacks and executive $ won. 

#ReverseRobinHood #RepealTheTrumpTax
Completely REPEAL the TAX CUTS ACT, and concentrate on collecting every last dime of the deferred income tax on the books.

The last thing we need is tax cuts with an over $120T debt, including unfunded obligations
 @realDonaldTrump
This is propaganda, please report as spam to prevent the spread of fake news.
Hi Mitch McConnell ,  how are your Russian friends doing

Why is the GOP having such a hard time selling its Tax plan?

BECAUSE IT SUCKS!…
Thx! Stay away from CNN #fakenews
can't even leave your safe space to tell lies? pathetic
#GOPTaxScam is only meaningfully going to the wealthy! 88% of tax breaks to the top 1% breaks the US Treasury and hurts America
How about some spending reform.
Sorry, I never watch @TeamCavuto's propaganda show on @FoxNews, the Trump/GOP propaganda machine.
Why don't you explain your evolution, Mitch.
You left out the word "Rich", you lying POS.
Tell him, every1,how u r going to get all nominees approved..Time is of the essence now! Go to simple majority..have DEMs work 24/7! Remember the thug Reid...Obstructing Dems don’t care...Don’t let this moment in history pass..gentlemanly rules don’t work w/ Dems blinded by hate!
How do you justify the gigantic deficit increase? You would have made every attempt to block the same type of Tax Cuts if President @BarackObama was our president. Just pure hypocrisy!!

McConnell and @SenateGOP are despicable liars, only the weal;thy are getting a tax cut, while the middle class pay more, the needy get less and the budget deficit increases
VOTE OUT @HouseGOP @BrianFitzUSA
Agreed, the top 1% are included in your “American People”, but what about the remaining 99% who your tax bill is going to fiscally fuck in the ass over and over for the next decade?
#TaxScam
I bet you don’t mention the skyrocketing national debt.  Jackarse.

.@SenateMajLdr Oh no, the 1.5 Trillion dollar #Taxfraud scam broke the Tax Day computer. Now the #TaxDay Computers are spiting out a warning note; Vote for all #Democrats in 2018/2020. #trumpdumpcare #Emma4Change #Resistance #FBR
It is not you clueless old man. You and your GOP buddies made off like bandits. Yes bandits. You just stole our livelihoods you stupid man
Funny how my refund was smaller this year than last year even though I made the same amount of money and nothing has changed from last year. How do you explain that? And with the 5 bucks I get more a week now - does it mean I have to pay in next year? #TaxScam
Most companies are using the Tax Cuts given to them for stock buy backs. Your wealthy friends and donors got wealthier. Middle and lower classes got ripped by the GOP Congress led by you and @SpeakerRyan!!
meanwhile you would stab the president in the back any chance you got. sad day. when are you retiring again ??
Screw you and tRumps #faketaxcut #fakenews #LiarInChief
If you have a run a PR campaign to convince people you’ve helped them, you haven’t.
86 million people will see a tax increase this year. But as long as you made money......
Might address this
Quit with interviews and do your damn jobs!
Resign
FOX is the only channel that Would be complicit with your tax scam lies.
So you’re going to be explaining how you are providing tax cuts to the wealthy off the backs of the working people. Oh sure thanks bunches. BTW get a grip on your governor before he completely destroys Ky.

A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows that the tax-cut law has sagged in public esteem lately. Working-class, middle-class, and upper-class Americans all hold negative views of the tax-cut law. via @CNBC https://nbcnews.to/2JQycKt 
Spoiler Alert: Its not benefiting the majority of Americans, but you already knew that and could care less.
Remember to be clear, it’s benefiting 2% of the American people according to your previous tweet.
Why do you really think that people will beleive you if you just keep repeating the same ole lie? Repeating the same thing over and over with the same results is a sign of insanity. Tax breaks only helped you and your doners. Those small bonuses where their yearly Christmas bonus

Make sure you say hi to Hannity, hiding under his desk, crying.
Will you discuss how you will use reconciliation to pass real immigration reform and build the wall? Or how about gavel congress out to recess, so our President can have recess appointments?
No? Then I'm not interested. 
Step down.
Talking about the taxscam doesn’t change that it is a taxscam! Fox News aka Trump TV (just ask Hannity)...
Are you going to be honest?

Did the RNC provide any compensation to Elliott Broidy? Pay for his flights? Hotel accommodations? Anything?

Because if so, money being fungible and all (Thanks, Ernie Istook!), the…
WE are seeing you and your lies.  Tell the employee's of @GM how this tax cut/reform is helping them.
Yes Tax scam is helping you and @SecElaineChao and her daddy business
Why not discuss protecting Mueller and tell us what the corrupt and evil @GOP is doing about the #CRIMINALPresident? We already know that your tax scam only benefits the rich at the expense of the average American. I'm sick and tired of your lies, rhetoric, and downright bullshit

Paying taxes under Obama gave Americans a sense of pride — they knew they were contributing to a greater good. 

Paying taxes under Trump, knowing that the money will just to bankroll…
Get rid of the filibuster.
You can lie about this tax scam all you want, but we know the truth. We just finished paying out taxes, and they went UP.
Confirm Trump's appointees!
http://www.justiceforkatie.com/ 
explain this
You’re really going for the full-court press on this BS, aren’t you.

Donald Trump and Republicans sold their $1.5 trillion tax cut as boon for workers. Months after the bill passed the truly big winners will be corporations and 1% shareholders. Over 60% of the gains are going to stock buybacks to increase share value. Vote republicans out #TaxDay
And by "people" I of course meet mega corporations and those who run them! -- Senator Mitch McConnell (the people's politician -- and by "people" I of course mean mega corporations)
Oh man!  I hope you are prepared for all of those tough questions like, "How are you such a great patriot?" and "How does someone so handsome pass a historic tax cut?".  SO BRAVE, TURTLE!  #ShellOfAGuy
Better start moving now and get Presidents Nominees confirmed!
Bye
#StopLying
Republicans think corps are people, so don’t read too much into his ‘American people’ hype.
Well people work for the corps, shareholders are people too. Pensions, IRAs, 401Ks depend on corps to grow peoples retirements! Corps are people
Do they bleed, need HealthCare, have children? Thank you.
Yes the people that make up corps need all that,
Right, a need artificially created by legislators to fuel itself.
I paid three thousand more in taxes this year than last. Your tax scam sucks.
@SenMajLdr
We will be shredding the new tax code soon. That corporate welfare #GOPTaxScam added $2 Trillion in debt that if left in place, our grandchildren will be paying off
Just resign instead.
