With all due respect, you will do the same with this as you do with so many other things.  Nothing.
Good job! Time to stop those damn do gooders that strive to make safer & less polluting autos! How dare they think that consumer safety & cleaner air is anyone's business. PROFITS are the primary & only concern! Way to go!

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …

And I'll add some NOT cherry picked references
Hardy ha!
Yup, gotta ensure they can FUK CONSUMERS! PROFITS OVER PEOPLE, assholes!
We have Pres. Obama to thank for bailing out America’s auto industry, not #GOP deregulation.

#greasyMitch
You are a fool
With so many sustiable business models being profitably implemented, like GE has done, how can the auto industry prepare itseld financially for a sustianable future?
Yes thos crazy consumer protection laws—-so troublesome.
Your protecting special inrterests over the public as usual. Ay least you have the guts to tell striaght.
Oh please! You don't care if consumers get cheated.
Re: screw the public so auto industry can make more money.

Sick, Weasel Mitch.
Chilean sea bass have more moral conviction than you!
BULL SHIT 
how about protecting consumers not wall street

Stormy Daniels reacts to Pres. Trump's denial he knew anything about $130,000 payment made to her: "I work in the adult business and I'm a better actor than he is." http://abcn.ws/2CcjBVI  
Good news 

Wait a minute, you're protecting consumers from an agency whose purpose is to protect consumers? Huh? Talk about doublespeak. Who’s protecting us from bozos like you?
McConnell is a partisan idiot.

That crap of not allowing Obama to pick supreme court justice, with months left on his term, was a insult 2 everything this country stands for 
Would have been more fair to keep Scalia alive on a machine and then pull the plug when Trump won
The GOP. The Savior of all who will step all over Americans. And reward big auto when they successfully sell you a LEMON. And you have no recourse because there is no accountability. Your stuck with payments and a car that will always be broke.
he is forgetting one thing,,if that can be done then all of the rules would apply to Obama's pen.
@SenToomey has a BA in PolySci and is steeped in Club for Growth ideology....if he knew something I wouldn't mind, but he's an idiot and only understands giving more money to folks who don't need more with money from the poor and middle class.
Yeah, Mitch - the CFPB is to blame for "stretching authority".
*coughs*
MERRICK GARLAND!
*coughs*
WTF is wrong with you? Americans are not buying gas guzzling cars. They’ll buy foreign cars if the milage is better
Brazen is a word that members of the gop should avoid.
You mean their brave attempt to protect the citizens of this country? & All consumers of US autos? Senators do your job, stop blocking protections for consumers, fellow citizens, the people you're supposed to be representing
The auto industry was doing fine
BS
Protect those consumer baby!!
Yeah... protecting the finances of consumers was really overstepping the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Resign and delete your account
You and most of the Republicans in Congress are taking the party, my party, to new all time lows and claiming you are helping people.  You should all find something else to do with your lives.
CFPB no longer represents and protects the ppl as it was designed to! More money into the pockets of big industry and Republican toadies
Really?!?
Why does @sentoomey and @jerrymoran and@senateMajldr McConnell want the United States to be as polluted and the the people as sick as China? it won’t just be tainted dog food any more. We will all get sick.
Resign traitors.
You were sent to DC to protect your constituents not the auto industry. They can take care of themselves.
Kentucky please, please vote this corrupt Politican out of office. He doesn't mention that GM just reduced its workforce in Ohio by 1,800 people. McConnell doesn't care about any American auto worker. As for Toomey, from my home state, he's the biggest crook ever. #2018MidTerms
Man, he’ll just never, ever get it.
You say this like it is a good thing.
Hahahaha obstructions lying mich
Safety and fuel efficiency are for the weak. Other brazen attempts to overreach authority like airbags and seatbelts will be the next to go?
McCannell, you are not Leader. You are an enabler to Trump and Putin. You are a disgrace!

Baloney.  The repubs under Mulvaney's leadership are eviscerated the CFPB.  He is clearly coming down on the side of corporations and banks.  It was supposed to be the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.  Youi and McConnell are a joke in touting the current status of the CFPB.
@well said Senate Majority leader @SenateMajLdr !  Damn proud of you coming out strong like this!  It’s time for every industry to join the economic tune up as we collectively reach for the stars as One People, One Nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all!

What a load of crap. This brazen attempt you refer to was to make our land safer from the corporate evils of the oil industry 
Where we are at now is a nation ruled by an oligarchy. A tyrannical dictator at the helm, and his corporate owners in the cabinet. #tuckfrump

I’m so ready for Friday, be sure to register people to vote at your walk out! High schoolers can even register ppl!

STEEL TARIFFS!
Who is protecting the American citizens in flint Michigan? No drinking water for 3 years, 10 months and 19 days. What happened to America first? #FlintWaterCrisis #BackfireTrump #Flint #Michigan #AMERICA
YOU need to resign...
How DARE the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stand up for consumers against the auto industry! Good thing the GOP is still there to stand up for the big guy!
I promise you,we will repeal and replace the turtle,because we deserve more better . Congratulations Senate Majority Leader @SenSchumer  #YesWeCan  #RegisterToVote #GOTV #TakeBackTheSenate #FlipTheHouse #GOPComplicit  #VoteThemAllOut
STFUThe president just pulled back sanctions that you passed against Russia, and you're trying to distract us with this bullshit! That is why I left the GOP in 2016
Too bad you don’t protect #Kentucky #disabledveterans like you do #bigbuisness.  

Every 2 1/2 days a veteran commits #suicide in Kentucky.  #medicalcannabis has proven to reduce that tragic number.  Yet you protect the auto industry more than us.

Why? 

#22Strong
Yea...outrageous...not just KY...all over the country
So... you're trying to protect consumers from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? We need the @CFPB to protect us from YOU.
How dare the government tell the private sector what to do via regulation! 

I am entertained by this. Gracias.

She's a pawn









Resign.
