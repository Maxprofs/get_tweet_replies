And  62,979,879 Americans voted for 45, your point is? Strong choice does not equate to the '" right choice". One Hawk in the Cabinet is enough. Who will counter Bolton's jingoism?

Ok Leader, lead. You've screwed the middle class with your tax cut, screwed the poor by taking their health insurance. The only thing left is taking away Social Security. Pence will help you do that. #ImpeachTrump Now! Before he kills us all.
Of course, Pompeo has no brain
Wrong again, Mitch!! Mike Pompeo is the wrong man for the job unless you believe bombing Syria and any other nation we don't like will bring lasting peace. Trump the draft dodger is building a war cabinet so he can play at war and threaten our lives and the rest of the world!
And neither are you.


AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!

No he is like you so stuck up 45 arse, you reject 75% of Americans wanting you to #ProtectMueller #ProtectRosenstein from the madman! You are suppose@to represent all and even most Republicans want them protected! DO YOUR JOB PROTECT US FROM 45 who’s manipulating it so he can!
only if you are looking for another ass kisser.
What it is about our political system, and the @GOP, that has made room for a mobster to occupy the highest office in the land?
Prove it
Trump is unfit to command -
Me in @TheAtlantic about today’s presidential Twitter outburst  https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/unfit-to-command/558074/ …

Nearly 200 ex-U.S. ambassadors and veteran diplomats have signed a letter expressing alarm over the slide in U.S. leadership in the world. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-200-former-diplomats-are-alarmed-at-the-state-of-american-diplomacy/2018/03/28/3f4ac510-32ac-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html …
You’re dead wrong turtle man. He is a puppet to Trump just like you. We don’t need another one of those in that job.  This is your fault you corrupt SOB!
This is the absolute, unqualified, categorical, complete, total, downright, outright, utter, out-and-out, undiluted, unequivocal, untempered, veritable, perfect, consummate, pure, sheer #TRUTH #McConnell …
#Pompeo is a bitch who would be a horrific #SecretaryofState. Not a smart choice, not a good move.
You're Welcome America!

Look, you are complicit with this @WhiteHouse administration running amok, making us look like fools and you passing rich tax cut and worried about deficits? No wonder you won't have any town halls. You're ashamed and know what you have done! @SpeakerRyan does to and he's out!
Which ones? My understanding was that he couldn't tell his ass from his elbow during the confirmation hearings. Just one more step away from democracy and diplomacy.
60% at least of the USA population say you're not fit to lead anything.

You should retire instead of screwing up this great nation , follow @SpeakerRyan steps, “QUIT”!!!. @business @Twitter @nytimes @washingtonpost @GOP @TheDemocrats @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump

Scum. 

Make no mistake about what’s at stake here: firing Rosenstein would be the same unconscionable assault on the rule of law as firing Mueller. He controls scope of the Mueller investigation and what becomes public. Both D’s and R’s should reject sham excuses to fire Rosenstein.1/2
If you and Ryan were wanting to do the right thing you would stand for our President and defund Robert Mueller.  You have no guts period.
Then stop playing around and approve him. By the way the senate should not be writing anything about Mueller's investigation like you are backing him and not your President.  Trairors all.
@SpeakerRyan
The Republican Party is now the Party of Trump. Three of 4 leaders at RNC’s finance team embroiled in scandal with Elliott Broidy second one forced OUT, after news broke that Michael Cohen made a hush payment for him to quiet a woman he knocked up (not his wife.)
Not really. Why are you not allowing a vote to protect Mueller? Is he uncovering something on you too?
you neocon warmongers are so predictable, it's not even funny anymore. People didn't vote for this though...
Mitch, you and your cronies told Obama that if he went into Syria without Congress approval, you would impeach him.
When does the impeachment of Trump begin?
He is an inexperienced hawk with little geo-political experience and history or anti-semitism .We can do so much better.
hi
Thanks for letting Trump bomb into war without Congressional approval. GOP are scared rabbits.
You know the president's actions on Syria are illegal without a vote in Congress. Your approval statement only shows how insanely corrupt you are.
yea, right.
Americans want Mueller to finish his investigation unimpeded, the report(s) to be public, indictments filed and punishment delivered if warranted, and Rosenstein to stay on the job. This isn’t about politics, it’s about the sanctity of our democracy
Please do something to save us from our incompetent president.
Your a stain on trump's underpants
God.  You’re all delusional.  #Votethemout.
Mouthpiece for 45... no courage like the rest of you! Cowards all! No on Pompeo!!
DO SOMETHING NOW!!!!
You mean a strong choice to lead us into war, possibly one that could end all life on earth.

There Turtle Boy, fixed it for you.
REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU ENJOY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF A DUMPSTER FIRE
Protect Mueller.
Fire Muller!
Only 30?
So he is a strong leader, same could be said for HOW MANY! who have been fired or had the sense to leave.  When are you going to get a stiff upper lip and do something about the idiot.  He is making sure the GOP will be going down in flames, Hell mend you.
James Comey: "I don't know whether the current President of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in 2013, it's possible, I don't know."
You’re dirty if you refuse to protect Mueller.
I can't wait for the GOP to be removed from power.
Why just one choice for the job? I’d bet there’s more qualified @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @SenBillNelson
As a lifelong Republican I call on you to resign,I won't give you 5 cents.
Granted. Now let's talk about your refusal to even put so much proposed legislation to a vote. Why are you squandering the majority?! #pissingitaway #growAset #RINO
nope but another cute lie from a hypocritical 
No they don’t , no one thinks he is qualified except to kiss Trump’s ass
If he's so good let hime take your place. Maybe Washington could get something done right!! Or maybe just done.
Bite me.
URGENT:  you must schedule a vote on legislation that limits trump’s ability to fire Mueller.
Me Too!
#StableGenius
Please be careful. I hope your vetting process is a little better than what it was, because you did hire some bad seeds that had to be let go. Although I think some people tend to not realize that is part of the hiring process, especially when you are dealing with a swamp.
Is 30 enough?
He sure is but democrats will oppose because they will do anything to keep Trump from being successful. The questions democrats asked yesterday had nothing to do with his qualifications but was to gen up their base.
Yes absolutely!!
No he's not. You're a liar!
Something tells me he and Hillary have a different kind of red button.
fired Director of FBI, fired Deputy Director of FBI, Pardoned the person who compromised a CIA agent. The .@GOP has moved from the party of law and order to the party of corruption. Any choice for any office is now suspect.
@SpeakerRyan  @HouseGOP  @SenateGOP  @NancyPelosi  @SenatorSchumer Maj Ldr, if there is some polling of this 30 individuals then you must have that data for open publication. Your blind acceptance appears to be more normalization than fact based?
https://twitter.com/drdenagrayson/status/984840250747957249?s=21 … you fearless leader.

Protect Rosenstein and Mueller - this truly is insanity.
If your endorsing him then he has to be as corrupt or even more corrupt than you and the republican party. As far as you are concerned, this is a good fit into party over country!
I know it's hard for you, but you need to act like a leader and keep those whining stalling Democrats in session until all of the positions get filled in the executive branch... #digraceful
And you’re always spot on with your opinions, right?  

Like that #goptaxscam you rammed through?  Yes, the one that the CBO says 80% of the financial benefit will go to foreigners. 

You stand behind trump.  You don’t honor your oath.  Your judgement is questionable.

Mike Pompeo gave three different answers to the question: Did Trump ask you to get Comey to back off the Michael Flynn investigation? That doesn't inspire confidence.
McConnell's wife is a Trump cabinet member who has meet with and had financial dealings with Russia.
You are disgusting. Sycophant to worst POTUS in history. History will not treat you well.
you are disgusting

We are waiting for YOUR RESPONSE MITCH??
Any silence about impeachment against trump tells me a lifelong republican that your just as corrupt as Trump. Sad
Retweet from Michael on here: Your Job Mitch is start Impeachment procedings against Donald now
And Direct To Mitch: Bipartisan bill out to protect the firing of Mueller. Are you going to support the Bill Mitch? Or are you going to claim “ I don’t think Mueller will be fired?”
Everyone reading this PLEASE retweet to Mitch why he is against America and supports Trump. ASK MITCH
Mitch are you for the Rule of Law and your Country? Or do you support lies and corruption? We deserve an answer!
Mitch As a Republican I and Everyone else wants to know why you Support Donald Trumps Corruption? We deserve an answer

Ultimately, only a howl of public outrage would be enough to protect Muller and his investigation https://thebea.st/2HintKp 
So, 30 other bigots say it’s good?  That’s good enough for me.
You would say anything and do anything #Trump wants??? It's disgusting the cabinet and choices you've made, ruined #GOP party and America's good standing around the world... because you are so partisan without a soul. $$$$$ Pigs get slaughtered -turtle soup is delicious. #Resign
You are despicable
Of course they do Mitchie! #GOPtreasontrain
Really, my personal choice would have been David Duke!

I'd like to know who those 30 are.  Your choices leave a lot to be desired.  Anyone who trusts you blindly should have their head examined.

Publish your list of the 30 bipartisan who think Pompeo is a strong choice to lead the @StateDept. A strong choice does not mean Pompeo is the best or even an average choice to actually head the State Dept. He's Trump choice @nytimes @thehill @WhiteHouse @washingtonpost @maddow
Who wrote that talking point? Wow!

#choirMitch
No, he’s not. #PompeoHearing #blockpompeo

Hey Bitch - how ‘bout you follow Ryan’s lead and step aside.  You’re all but useless in role anyway.
Strong if we want to go to war next week in a place we shouldn’t be. #warcabinent
He is the worst you could pick. Up there with Pruitt and you. Block the pick of Supreme Court judge, hide the Russian tampering......
I don’t trust anything coming from you or th @GOP at this point. ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION OF FOX PROGRAMMING LAST NIGHT OR ANYTHING ABOUT OUR @POTUS WHO LIES, YET NOTHING DONE. #VoteOutGOP 2018/2020
Get him through now.
BullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshitBullshit
He’s #REPUGNANTCON
You are a real dufus! 

#Omnibus Why?

#Pompeo

Pompeo is good choice.
Pompeo didn't disclose his Chinese related business on his SF-86.  He is not fit to work for the US Government.  Drain the swamp vote NO!
Like everyone else in this administration that is yet another lie!!!
Mitch..Mitch...Mitchy...Mitch...Mitch...Mitch ..Mitchell...Leader...in what exactly?...
He's a piece of crap like all the other wackos Trump has appointed.  Even Kelly, who proved he is a liar by making up that b.s. about a Congresswoman, and refusing to apologize for it proved he isn't honorable.
A man that has no empathy for the atrocities and discrimination in this country and the world should not be head of the state dept. he refused to answer questions based on this that is not ok. He is a racist unfeeling jerk and should not be a representative of this country.
Just like all the other ones he’s let go. White House is out of control.
When the dust settles on this presidency, the most heinous and shameful creature in office during  this time will be you.
Confirm him!!! Holding up all of President Trumps confirmations isn't hurting Trump it's hurting America.
not everyone in YOUR OWN PARTY agree with your statement
hey Mitch,  lets get ALL of the POTUS  NOMINEES CONFIRMED NOW!!!!! be a LEADER and help the President get his team in place NOW!! founding fathers didn't have 60 votes in the constitution to pass laws in the Senate!! NUCLEAR OPTION!!
I think I see @SenateMajLdr "blinking" T-O-R-T-U-R-E in his #Twitter profile pic.....
Whatever you say Bitch McTurtle 
Who cares. He's a bad choice like most of Trumps picks
Get this done... stop fighting our @POTUS #MAGA
Mike Pompeo gave three different answers to the question: Did Trump ask you to get Comey to back off the Michael Flynn investigation? That doesn't inspire confidence.
It hard to believe anything you say.
What will you do when Dotard sacks Mueller?
He's a Koch bros pet and Trump toady. We can do better.
All you talk about is bipartisan support & hemp. You won’t do anything positive for this country if Chuckie Schumer, the real majority leader, doesn’t approve of it. You are a disgrace & should be ashamed to call your self a Republican & a Senator. I pray KY kick you to the curb.
He is a bigot just like #45. He is a Koch Brothers aide just like you are Mitch.
He's compromised.
Pompey is a homophobic asshole!
Boys club intact. 
go ahead, it's all going to change soon. Too late to learn how to govern. Bye, bye.
30 aliens think you should return to your home planet.
What a stupid statement!  You can get 30 bipartisan people to say anything -- so what.  The question is whether he's a person who can stand up to our stupid president and speak truth -- or more basically does he know what truth is?
Please follow @SpeakerRyan lead and announce your resignation. At least step down as leader, now.
Name each and every one of the thirty who think Pompeo's qualified to be Secretary of State. Like former Secretary of State Clinton, someone the current administration abhors, I wonder how many others you use for your purpose to get this ass passed and tomorrow will again berate.
No. #NoPompeo
