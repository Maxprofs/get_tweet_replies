Let me get the smallest violins in the world for you, you obstructing hypocrite. Doesn't feel very good now, does it? 
Case in point - Pruitt spoke to the timber industry. Told them that burning wood was as clean as solar power. I'll just park that right there.
The arrogance of that guy is breathtaking. Him. Mulvaney. Zincke. Corrupt AF grifters.
Trump puts people in office to do his bidding - As a private citizen, Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times. That's why he got the job. To dismantle it
Zinke to sell off national parks for mining
DeVos to erode the public education system 
Every damn one of them is destroying our country
Yup. NASA! No science. Someone picked these people for him. He didn't know any of then before his term. Koch Bros?
Mike Pence.
Manafort picked Pence. Think these appointee's were contributors or did favors for Trump & he wanted em dumb so he could just tell them how to not do their jobs.
Simple response: Remember Obama’s last Supreme Court nominee?
"In the history of the United States, 168 presidential nominees have been filibustered, 82 blocked under President Obama, 86 blocked under all the other presidents. 
 When our Grandchildren wonder what happened to the USA show them this picture.
Which is why its puzzling Trump's nominees fly through confirmation & past records are never questioned nor do they seems to play any role in getting confirmed.
Maybe b/c so many of Trump's nominees are fundamentally unsuited for the positions they would take. Take for example the completely unvetted and unsuitable #RonnyJackson. Thank goodness some in Congress take their oversight roles seriously. p.s. #MerrickGarland
#MerrickGarland
Judge Garland would like a word.
And you stole a Supreme Court nomination from the previous president, one who didn't collude with foreign actors or break campaign finance laws to be elected. This president is illegitimate, and trying to destroy our democracy. The people standing up to him are patriots.
My, what a short memory, Mitch!

MERRICK GARLAND

@GOP spent 8 YEARS obstructing EVERY Obama nominee, led 82 filibusters, 65 votes attacking the ACA, SHUT DOWN OUR OWN GOVERNMENT, costing $24B & STOLE a SCOTUS seat...

Bravo for the Democrats. Your nominees have been disasters with hidden corruption.
Merrick Garland. We will never forget, never forgive.

Remember that dinner you all had on the night of Obama's inauguration? The one where you declared your mission to be the failure of the Obama presidency? Remember the stimulus bill? Money for infrastructure? But...debt, you said.

YOU STOLE A SUPREME COURT SEAT. SHUT. UP.
Merrick Garland. I will never forgive you, you awful man. You ruined the comity of the Senate almost singlehandedly, refused to seat justices for Obama, and now you want sympathy. Screw that you evil parasite.
Maybe if @POTUS nominated QUALIFIED candidates instead of demagogues they wouldn't require obstruction, also, 'Merrick Garland.'
*Merrick Garland*
Maybe you could have let Garland get a vote and it'd be different. You asked for this and are now complaining about it. Grow up and deal with the consequences of your actions. You're 76 for crying out loud.
History will remember your hypocrisy & your lack of leadership when ethics & morality should have mattered @SenataMajLdr

#MerrickGarland #Emoluments #TrumpisCorrupt
Merrick Garland , all those judgeship's you stole Mitch. Your 2009 inauguration night pledge of voting no on anything @BarackObama . Then there was your refusing a bi partisan release about Russian hacking. Your Grand Old Putin Party is finished. We have had enough!
MERRICK GARLAND
So what’s your point?
Really? Do you think we’ve all developed amnesia? Or that we’re just all that stupid? You took obstruction to a whole new level, and now you want to cry when the table is turned on you. And it would help if his nominees were remotely qualified.
Unfair the Dems are holding up my picks!  If only the GOP controlled the house and senate!
Hey Mitch, are you aware that THE @GOP CONTROLS CONGRESS??  Quit blaming the @dnc for your failures. I think I despise you even more than I despise Trump because you’re not mentally ill like him, you’re just an ass.

You’re entirely and exclusively full of shit, Mitch. Remember Merrick Garland? We do.
Perhaps that says something about the rancid dog shit he's nominating, Mitch.
That’s putting it lightly.

Silly @SenateMajLdr 

You know this is a false comparison.

Trump nominated uniquely unqualified self-interested Swamp Rats to destroy the Departments they will lead.

Previous 6 Presidents, for the most part, nominated individuals they thought would help the country.
To use your own words, shouldn't the next President decide on these appointments? Trump didn't win with a majority of votes and has even less support now. Let's wait for a President that WINS THE POPULAR VOTE. Oh yeah. MERRICK GARLAND!!
Have you met Pruitt? Devos or Carson? HOW can you be ok with destroying our Country?

This is who McConnell answers to.
I would SO love to steal that! If they haven't already, they also need to 'illustrate' Bevin.

Maybe if Trump would stop nominating completely unqualified, corrupt, incompetent people who don't deserve and haven't earned the position they're being nominated for, confirmations would go more smoothly. Just saying.
His nominees are taking longer than normal because they are unqualified. They represent Oligarchs. This president has no interest in upholding the rule of law. He is a dime store crook who has ruined his fame on the long con game. #oligarchy
1. Nominees fr President Obama NEVER MADE IT TO A VOTE

2. If this president only nominates those who flatter/agree with him, you should expect high level of scrutiny.

3. Reminder - your stats mean nada because you DIDNT ALLOW OBAMA NOMINEES A VOTE

Merrick Garland comes to mind.
I’m sorry I thought that we had three branches of government because checks and balances are like....a good thing? 

I mean I’m sure that was your stance when you blocked Merrick Garland. 
Merrick Garland you turkey
Merrick Garland ring any bells  or should we all pretend that didn’t happen??
Merrick. Fucking. Garland.
The @GOP in the Mid-Terms:
Merrick Garland says hi.
Merrick Garland. Cassandra Butts.
Now let me think...why would these nominees find difficulty getting appointed? Can I get Dr. Jackson on the phone?
#MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland was head and shoulders above the idiots, liars, sycophants and toadies that Trump nominated and you are trying to cram down America's throat. I am profoundly grateful for the Democrat senators who are fighting this travesty every step of the way.
Eternally grateful, I'll add
Trump nominess are not properly vetted, most are unfit for the jobs he is appointing them for, plus...
Merrick. Fucking. Garland. https://twitter.com/senatemajldr/status/989199961731551232 …
And did I mention:
Or what about the people nominated to reside over courts that have never ever been in a court before. Holy shit Mitch if you can’t remember back that far you shouldn’t be in the Senate.
So hard for them to connect the dots
I hate you Mitch.
Keep up the good work Dems!! Block these nominations to prevent the GOP taint on American democracy. DT is unfit to serve.

Merrick Garland
Let's start with Merrick Garland and nearly every single judge Barack Obama tried to appoint to federal benches. You are a hypocrite of the highest order. That you can lie to everyone including yourself shows you're a sociopath.
When Merrick Garland is on the Supreme Court, you can complain. Until then, you can’t. Besides, Trump is nominating the worst people for the job and you know it!
You should be the LAST person to complain about obstruction. If this "president" could do things right the first time, there wouldn't be a need to confirm the same position over and over. He's a raging lunatic with a higher turnover rate than a fast food restaurant.
If the Fuhrer45 Administration properly vetted candidates instead of trying to “FILL THE SWAMP” with corrupt, unethical, compromised nominees then there would be no issues. Retire gracefully Mitch! #Resist #Resistance #FBR #FBRResistance #BlueWave2018 #Vote #VoteBlue
What a complete fraud you are.
You effing brought this on yourself. One word GARLAND!!!  You stopped this good man and payback is a bitch. Now we stop the corrupt and underqualified nominees from the worst president to the worst majority leader ever.
Hypocrisy much? Don’t remember merrick garland? All those other federal judgeships you refused to fill?
As Republicans control everything at the moment, what do you think the problem is, Mitchy boy?
Just so you know:
Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, was on Capitol Hill today to speak to the House Judiciary Comm.  NONE of the Republicans showed up.  This is totally unacceptable!  Thttps://politi.co/2HMcNUx

Maybe they’re dangerous 

Or maybe we all remember

Garland
Maybe because they aren’t qualified or worse are being nominated to undermine and privatize at the expense of the American taxpayers footing their bloated salaries to make things worse for American taxpayers? 
You might suggest that he vet his picks before he actually nominates them.  We want qualified people!
Rotting goat bowel. Oh I like that.
;)
Didn’t seem to bother you when you obstructed Obama..your talking point is mute Mitch..go cry a river somewhere else b/c we DGAF
Cry me a river. You denied Garland his rightful place on SCOTUS.

Perhaps if the nominees were actually qualified and not just quid pro quo political payback choices and yes-person, sycophants, they wouldn't be facing the necessary opposition of the adults in the room. When is enough, enough, GOP? #ComplicitGOP
Worst @POTUS ever making the worst nominations ever deserves to be resisted. #Corruption #Resist
Trump & the @GOP sure can dish it out but are such big whiners when it’s done to them

The DEMs are only playing the same game you employed for 8 years of Obama’s presidency & are doing their Constitutional duty to check the corrupt Trump Admin

Man up!
Merrick Garland
No one is.buying your lies anymore, Mitch.
Could the be because his nominees are NOT qualified? Maybe he should do vetting, but I don't think trump even knows what that means.
Fuck you very much.
Most of the vacancies stem from Trump’s slowness to nominate & his firing of those already confirmed. Poor vetting and impulse picks have led to time wasted on nominees who struggle or are withdrawn. More than 200 positions still lack nominees...

Are you really going the "obstructionist" route after YOU personally obstructed President Obama at every turn, including neglecting your constitutional duty to "advise and consent" on Obama's SCOTUS nominee (Merrick Garland)?
That's because so many of his nominees are - unlike MERRICK GARLAND - transparently unqualified for the positions he's nominated them for.
Fun fact, nominating qualified people without obvious special interest ties and conflicts of interest would probably fix that.
I’ve 2 words for you Merrick Garland
Nominees shouldn’t be appointed during the evidence gathering period of a president’s impeachment.
How does it feel turtle boy? When @BarackObama was elected ya'll agreed to pass NOTHING! Turnabout is fair play
Merrick Garland.  Ring a bell? How the hell DARE you, after you vowed to block anything and everything Obama did and tried, but he was still one up over you all. You Sir, are as Un-American as they come and you should be ashamed but you're too corrupt. Take a damn SEAT.

Get the message? We don't want people such as yourself polluting our government. Go home, Turtle, you lousy lying cockroach.
Please don't insult turtles by calling Mitch that nickname.
Fuck you you saggy ball old man. You promised to make Pres Obama a 1 term president the night of his inauguration & spent the next 8 years trying to fuck him over capping it off with blocking Merrick Garland's nomination. You have some huge saggy balls old man - HUGE saggy balls.
Leader McConnel could suck a dick or two if he had any lips.
TO ALL THE TRUMP HATERS , LOOKING BACK, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH OBAMA PICKED HIS NOMINEES STRAIGHT FROM A CRIMINAL LINE UP. TO U MR. MajLdr...STEP UP AND GET RID OF YOUR ANTIQUATED RULES
How many days did it take to get Loretta Lynch confirmed? Tom Cotton, Rand Paul, Shelby of AL, just to name a few put a HOLD on @POTUS44 nominees. Cotton held one nominee for over 200 days, she died while waiting. Then You single handedly STOLE a #SCOTUS Seat. UnAmerica. WRONG!

Also - maybe the last few presidents were vetting their nominees?  You should suggest that to your boss Donald.
Whiners like you are pitiful
I don't suppose it has anything to do with the number of profoundly unqualified  and overtly racist, xenoohobic, and dishonest nominees.
#MerrickGarland you hypocrite
Look at the big names you’ve approved so far!  Barely have time for a cup of coffee before they are destroying their departments or making personal purchases or other swampy things.
I’m baffled that you believe the drivel that comes out of your mouth.
Karma’s a bitch.
Maybe if trump did not nominate bottom of the barrel people they would get in quicker.   #merrickGarland

Oh, really, Mr. ImGoingToMakeObamaAOneTermPresident, we all remember what you did. We will always remember Merrick Garland.
Shut up you ignoramus.   You have let this entire country down. You are participating in this conspiracy and obstructing justice.  Your demise will be epic.
They were presidents who weren’t 100% trainwrecks; they weren’t looking for anti-democracy miscreants to push an agenda of hate. But, that’s what you have embraced. Congratulations- you are a crime against all that America stands for- an enabler of evil.
Trump's nominees are usually unqualified, and often have ethical  issues that make them  questionable at best. You have zero credibility to discuss this issue: Merrick Garland.
Oh. I'm sorry, Turtle Boy, but did I hear you say MERRICK F*CKING GARLAND? No. I did not. Cuz I believe you set the tone here, NOT Ds.

Oh no!  Obstruction? Repeat after me, Merrick Garland...how about making a joint statement about Russian Cyber Warfare prior to the election? You destroyed that effort... #GOPCorrupt
You didn't seem to mind when you held a SCOTUS seat open.
WH sends nominations for confirmation without vetting of nominees. They have exhibited absolutely no standards for who they chose to lead agencies or sit one the bench. MOCs end up doing the vetting. Irresponsible. Because POTUS wants them doesn't mean they should have the job.
Says the King of Obstruction. Turtle Man, you’re not a leader, you’re a pawn for the most repulsive, immoral, corrupt Administration in history. Your head has spent way too much time in your shell, but voters will send you a message in Nov. #BlueWave2018

I'll just say Merrick Garland was a decent, honorable man and you treated him and the President unfairly. One reaps what they sow.
It would probably help if he actually nominated people with the knowledge and expertise to actually do the jobs they are nominated to do.
Fuck you, McConnell
You get no quarter after the shit you pulled when scumbag Scalia kicked it!  Get ready, when you lose the majority you will be indicted for accepting Russian money. We aren't going to forget your transgressions against the United States.
Blame yourself and your obstruction of President Obama’s judiciary nominees and oh yes, MERRICK GARLAND. Maybe if Trump’s nominees were actually qualified, things would be different. Go get some cheese for your whine.
Hey Mitch, Merrick Garland wants to know why you refused to give him a hearing and kept all those judge positions vacant for 2 years.
Trump is doing what Putin & Koch Brothers want to Destroy Democrocy & polluting the world! Marcon of France today trying to save our planet! There are people being brainwashed into voting against their own family for an ideology that is really against them!But they watch Fox News

Considering @POTUS potuaka Spanky does not vet them before he nominates them and one has pled guilty to a felony I hope 88 is all of them
Do you think we all suffer from amnesia?  YOU'RE THE GRANDDADDY OF OBSTRUCTION.  The day you stood and declared your job was to make Barack Obama a one term president is burned in my memory.  Merrick Garland, too.
