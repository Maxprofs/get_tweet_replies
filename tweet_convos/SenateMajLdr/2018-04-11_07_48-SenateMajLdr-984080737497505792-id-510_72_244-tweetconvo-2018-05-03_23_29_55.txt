Bro, are all you fellas yellah?

@BillOReilly
More misleading on behalf of your owners of the ruling class
Ryan has been a huge disappointment to conservatives.
Stepped up to the trough is more apt
None of you spineless dickheads should have a career in Congress. Term limits!
Selfless? Do you think you're selfless too?
Oh, he was so selfless.  Left with a net worth of $9,000,000.00.  Was chauffeured around in limos for 20 years.  Raised the National debt by trillions.  Like the mother Theresa of Congress.
LOL. @SpeakerRyan legacy is adding trillions to the national debt, supporting a tax policy that benefited the very wealthy and being silent about a @POTUS who loves dictators and lies every day.
#Vote them out!!!
#MAGA #POTUS needs to resign!!!
You are next to go you obstructionist RINO piece of liberal trash.  Either work for @realDonaldTrump  and his #MAGA agenda or resign and get the hell out of the way!  Americans demand real reform in congress, and you are just part of the swamp...
Traitor Ryan is a backstabbing sack of shite. We hold the House and Senate, yet you don't forge ahead with President Trump's MAGA plans. You couldn't rally a pack of hounds,  let alone all those lazy sacks of poo that supposedly  represent us. You're next McColon.
McConnell also made sure we got NO money for OUR WALL! By doing this: he and Ryan promoted illegals, heir drugs and violence! No protection for the American People! Stabbed POTUS in the back! Trump said, he would not sign another bill like that! Now Ryan Is a Dad! Sure! Elena
Get a grip!
We shall see who gets a grip on what! 
Hahahahaha hahahahaha
No, not even.
You’ve finally done enough for Mr. Ryan’s career. (Hee, hee.)

#talentagentMitch
And he was too afraid of Trump to speak from the heart. He quit rather than fought.
Nope not at all
SHUT UP HOE.
I need to quit u con

U both funded PlannedParenthood & blocked @POTUS Wall.  Very disappointed  disdain for President has been voiced & his actions along with No guts McConnell are a disgrace.  Reading “Secret Empires “ Mitch should also resign then we can get gavel back from Schumer.  Filibuster
GOP supporters and Jewish leaders oppose any kind of summit meeting between USA&Noko and between Soko&Noko.CVID is the way and Noko has helped Syria to developed chemical weapons&Nuclear WMD. No more crazy sunshine policy. Consider Noko refugees&Human rights,Kim Jong-un is Hitler
makes it two spineless cowards!

The Koch Brothers want their money back. He hasn't finished killing off all the safety net yet.

I wish you would step up to the plate.
...and helped us devolve into a second rate democracy...Ryan is a two bit, do-nothing coward...just like u Mitch.
Yes.  Ryan has certainly stepped up to the plate -   to ensure that the rich get more and teachers, workers, peel who take the early bus get screwed.  he has left us with an UNPRECEDENTED deficit.
i don't believe anyone called for some of the appropriations in that Omnibus Budget Bill ,esp. For Yak herders
You still do not get it. You had 1 Job. Republicans were sent to congress to pass Trump mandate legislation! You have failed!! You will all be replaced. Now I see along with Boehner; again lining pockets.
Too bad you're more interested in China than doing the right thing for Americans. Keep lining your pockets mumbles. We know who you really are now. Kentuckians won't fall for your lies again..count on it.. You can do the right thing, but we're not holding our breath.
Selfless he is about as Selfless as you are you old tool. Cannot wait to see you both out of office You two are the two worst of the whole GOP
You are next Drain The Swamp
#ENDRINOISM 

Hippocrit with a BORDER FENCE AROUND HIS PERSONAL HOME BUT NO FUNDING FOR SOUTHERN BORDER TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES!

@realDonaldTrump
Inconvenient Fact:  immigrant crime rate is less than the national crime rate.  tone down the hysteria
Never mentioned immigrants! 

If you live on the southern border then I will not lecture that it is/has been gateway to drugs, human trafficking and terrorism. 

63% of MEXICO IS CONTROLLED BY CARTELS
100% of America is controlled by billionaires who skim our tax $ and are planning massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. But you go worry about those hard-working immigrants. They pay tax. Trump doesn't. Deport Donald.
Your saying the killings of the illegals was okay!!! No get legal people in our country pay taxes pay for crimes as all Americans do illegals are let go... WRONG
ANOTHER Rat deserting a sinking ship!

There is no indication that Trump will fire Mueller except:

1. That time he ordered the White House counsel to fire Mueller…
You have failed the people and the President the people elected. You had all the opportunities and you couldn't let him succeed. We don't have to wait for history to tell us that.
And stole healthcare and social safety nets from the most vulnerable in society!  #niceguy #sellout
The House passed a lot of good legislation that died in the Senate
@SenateMajLdr YOU TOO Need to retire.  Why do YOU play GOD in not allowing Bills to come before a Vote.  History will not be good to your legacy and @SpeakerRyan his legacy responsible for the GOP leaving our country with Trillions of  debt.
You lost another corrupt enabler today. Time for you to do the same. We need to rid our Congress of the corrupt @GOP enablers who refuse to defend our laws and Constitution.
His job is to answer his constituency and the American people, not his colleagues. That’s the problem. You’re the problem.
Your plate is running over with record debt and @SpeakerRyan is living you the dishes. You both could've stopped @realDonaldTrump. Now what? #ImpeachTrump and @VP who knew all about #Putin #DirtyDon and the entire #TrumpCrimeFamily stands in for the remaining term? Just #resign
Leaving you the dishes.
I CALL BULLSHIT!!!!!
Hey Mitchy Mouth, follow Ryan’s lead and LEAVE
OMG! You actually said those words with a straight face. Incredible...absolutely incredible.
McConnell, we can already write your legacy.
Paul Ryan’s name is now synonymous with the cowardice of the Republican Party, except
@SenatorCollins 
@lisamurkowski
@SenJohnMcCain
@RepThomasMassie
@RepWalterJones
@RepCharlieDent
@RepStefanik
@RepTomMacArthur
Spineless noob who step up to the plate for rich and wealthy (tax “reform”) 
Stick it to elderly and sick 
You're just as bad Mitch! Neither one of you deserve this country I can't wait until people are in there that actually care about us. You both need to get Trump to resign or impeach or article 25 (crazy one)? HE IS NOT FIT TO SERVE!

DO YOUR JOBS!! BOTH OF YOU!
Still has Social Security & Medicare to destroy. He has time with McConnell as his side-they'll get it done now there is a TRILLION+ deficit & growing!! Goal all along.
YOU need to follow him.
"My legacy in Congress will be the image of a weak and immoral man with his head inside the anus of a Russian mole imitating the President"--(R-KY)  Senator Mitch McConnell
I say good riddance. You and he together have ruined the Republican Party for decades.  You both acquiesced to Trump and failed to lead when the nation needed it the most.  Time for you to retire McConnell
Go to the nuclear option NOW..  The Senate rules should be no different than the House.  That will stop the democrats and allow our people to have the remainder of the Trump agenda including new medical insurance plans.
BULL SHIT
Yup, so proud.
You both should be fired. Brought this mad man into the WH and you know it. Complicit to all of this fiasco. Re di pagliacci 
Good little whipping boy.
Yes, he was the perfect Laurel to your Hardy! Better follow him out the door old man! #Annoyed
You’re next Mitch.  #pathetic #Loser ... #TheResistanceVOTES ... #BlueTsunami is coming ... prepare for the #CorruptGOP to be swept aside ... #VoteThemOut2018
Please retire Mitch. You pilfered enough money from your time as a “civil servant”
Speaker Ryan has guts to have served the way he did and I guess under this leadership, leaving his job would be saving his soul. Let us see if you can?
Do you mean spineless Ryan. The only plate he stepped up to was his own and the 1% Mconnell.
Aw, Mitch! So untrue, so detestable on every level.
Why don't you retire now, too?
Pure bullshit.
Fuck you. Please feel free to join him.
You two are the worst fucking disease to afflict America since the civil war. Whatever disaster Trump gets us into is all on you.
The only people he answered to where Chuck and Nancy
@PRyan set the example for stepping down after a lengthy stay in congress where he turned into Swamp!

Will @SenateMajLdr follow and also step down?
Ryan's career will be defined by passing tax cuts for the 1% and having absolutely no courage to speak truth to power against Trump. He is an abject failure, just like you. Please follow his lead and #resign
You need to retire & resign!
yeah focused on destroying this country. Follow his lead and resign too!
Maybe you can explain why you refuse to allow a vote on legislation to protect SCO Mueller?

Not your pathetic "I remain confident Trump won;t fire him" bullshit, I mean what's the real reason?

If you're so confident that Trump won't act, what's the harm in passing legislation?
~~~AND he will ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED as... @PRyan trumped @POTUS
We can’t say the same of you McConnell can we?
pathetic. @PRyan and @HouseGOP cannot lead.

Good riddance to bad rubbish. Now if we could just get you to retire, Mitch.

Do your job. Protect our Country from our insane President

Ryan leaves a legacy of dramatically expanded government spending and immense unpayable deficits. Humungous Hypocrisy!! His legacy a bankrupt nation!!!
Should you not be serving the people and not just the @GOP party, @SenateMajLdr?  Hint:  Yes you should be!
We would be most grateful if you would follow @SpeakerRyan ‘s lead and GET OUT OF OUR SENATE! RETIRE, Mitch!
You mean selfishness.
And when do you leave so the government can function as it was meant to be
To bad you haven’t stepped up. Speaker Ryan has sent you over three hundred bills and you have done very little with them. Your worthless RESIGN NOW!!!!
Wait until he leaves. Why are we wasting out time on this crap?
booooooooo
U to need 2 retire or b voted out, criminal enablers

You are both jokes...stains on history. You should be ashamed of yourselves for what you have helped do to this country.
Awe Mitch to Ryan- go ahead and nominate him for 2020
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP  congrats to @PRyan for retiring, McConnell should follow...both will take their place in US history as crooked scumbags who served the very rich only....neither of you have anything to be proud of!
working Americans deserve more than to be used to make the 1% richer.....@PRyan would not win if he ran again and the complicit spineless corrupt coward knows that
Blah, blah, blah.  SOS
He's a spineless weasel, like you, who also tried to take healthcare away from needy Americans. You should both be ashamed.
Oh, so you defend Ryan & probably expect recipocation - you two are RINOs, through and through
Wish your old ass would get a clue and retire too. Ur are not with the people old man. Go on vaca or continue helping your family ship drugs all over the world. #vote #millienials #msdstrong #VoteThemOut2018 @cnn @MSNBC
Summed up as"he got rich and voters got poor!"
Why don’t you do everyone a favor and follow him out the door. Thanks for doing absolutely nothing about Trump.
As long as you’re making your masters happy with Tax cuts you could care less about America. History will not be kind to you . Disgrace
He'll be handsomely rewarded by the Koch brothers for the damage he's caused and the wealth he's transferred to them. Mission accomplished now beat feet before impeachment day. Feckless to the end.

MR McCONNELL if u learned nothing from COLLUSION TRUMP u certainly learned to LIE. Ryan stepped up to the plate , FROM THE GET GO HE WAS A BUFFOON. HE SAID WHEN TRUMP WAS ELECTED HE, RYAN WOULD NOT STAND UP WHEN TRUMP CAME IN THE HOUSE & WOULD NOT SHAKE HIS HAND. He FOLDED!
You better be careful Mr. Leader, Louie Dobbs & his boys at Fox are after you to
Can't wait to See your sorry ass go too. Mr. Made in China.
You forgot to add that you’re quitting as well! Please break the suspense! #KYJelly
Apologies, that should have been #KYJellyfish, you spineless #SwampDweller
Why don’t you get the people confirmation done !
You have allowed the democrats to control the senate!
You are the deep state!
Get out now!
Or 
Defend your president!
Democrats are all over the airwaves!
You and Paul Ryan are silent!
Stop the BS! If you both had a set, you would be supporting the president and you would actually work for the people. Stop lying! You need to leave Mitch! Stop being a rhino.
He has an unseasoned grilled chicken breast where his heart should be, and he hasn’t proven to be particularly bright or courageous either. I cheer his departure.
Who the hell do you think you are fooling McConnell? Ryan is a greedy corrupt fool. He has remained silent as trump and his vile administration have set out to destroy this nation. He was paid handsomely for his role in passing the tax scam. You are no better. Resign like he did.
And has colluded with Russia.  TRAITORS
What utter fiction. He is an abject coward. Just like you!

@SenateMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan do you guys cheat on your wives?.. hotels motels ect ect ect???
No one will miss the RINO RYAN who has become a worthless butthole around Washington for more than 20 years. Here he is as a #BROWN-#nosing legislative aide for then-Rep Sam #BROWNback (pun intended) in 1995 explaining how MEDICARE is bankrupt by 2001:

https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4057982/past-paul-ryan-todays-paul-ryan-full-stuff …
Retire
Heading a criminal enterprise isn't not admirable for either of you.
Oh look... The home has let the @SenateMajLdr out for a day trip... He’s been MIA for days. No doubt drooling in a corner somewhere soiling his Depends #BlueWaveIsComing2018 #ResistTrump
I wish I knew how to change his suit to prison stripes
When the going gets tough the tough get going, but GOP members just get going 
I am glad Ryan is leaving. He is a used car salesman with a sweet lying smile. Mr. McConnell you are next to leave. You are the nastiness, most deceitful grandpa next to #45.
Hey Mitch
the anti-Trump, Pro Koch Paul Ryan?
Who did Paul Ryan serve?
Selfless huh? Like selflessly taking millions from the NRA to protect the gun and violence industry?
It's also time 4 u Linda.

Hey Mitch!  Where've you been???  You've been kinda silent as of late.  What's a matter?  Cant say bad stuff about AssClown trump?  Elaine NEEDS her job?  Gonna sit this one out while the country slides into Fascism and you (and Ryan) Cash out?  #VoteMitchOut For Chrissakes!
Take his lead, Mitch.  RESIGN.
Yes and you and him have not supported the GOPs presidents agenda which is very disappointing and disgusting
Puh-lease! @SpeakerRyan oversaw the incredible fiscal bleed of our nation and run-up of the national debt. You should stick to congratulating yourself for stealing SCOTUS seat.
Coward, has supported worst potus ever
If by ‘stepped up to the plate’ you mean destroying poor people, sucking up to donors, and representing only the 1% then you’d be correct.
Nothing says selfless like a $500,000 donation to your PAC after passing a shitty tax plan for rich people
You won’t allow a vote to let Mueller, a fellow Republican, complete his job. I doubt you’re even a Republican. What are you so afraid of? Do they have photos and videos on you too or what?
He has been complicit in #Trump destroying #USA and will never be held responsible....he retires with a fat pension and #Republican donors to take care of him.....
I think you just stated his problem.  He answered his colleague’s call and not his constituent’s.  Remember the GOP mantra: Party over country.
Quick recap: having secured:  tax breaks for the firm he will join as a lobbyist, health & pension benefits funded by the taxpayers for himself, a looming record deficit, & proposed cuts to social programs to pay for it - Ryan is calling it quits?  #lyingcoward @nytimes @maddow
YOU NEED TO GO NOW.
Answered the call to help the rich and hurt the poor, then bail when things get hot. You’re just as complicit and cowardly. Game recognize game.
Neither of you will be remembered fondly
GOP in action! #PaulRyan
When is your resignation coming? Soon I hope!
Defend Mueller!
We will replace him w a Conservative!
You and Ryan are cowards, little pipsqueaks who don't know how to stand up to a con man. In fact you are both con-men so you all 3 fit together quite nicely. #RepublicanOligarchs #PaulRyan
#Fake
we are losing one of the best. in a rotten place like congress a person like ryan stands very very tall!
Coming from you...that means nothing. In October 2016, neither of you stepped up to the plate to protect the election process; and neither of you has done squat to protect the Rule of Law since.
Mitch, your next? #draintheswamp
.@SenateMajLdr when will you and your wife @SecElaineChao answer the charges listed in @peterschweizer new book? You know, allllllll that $$$$$ from China....
