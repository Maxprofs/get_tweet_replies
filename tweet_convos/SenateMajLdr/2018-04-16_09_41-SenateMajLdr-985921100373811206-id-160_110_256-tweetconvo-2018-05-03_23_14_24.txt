When are you bringing Mike Pompeo up for a vote on his confirmation?? It's critically important we get him confirmed now!! 
#MikePompeo #MAGA2018 

From the person who sought to undermine the Obama Administration's negotiations with Iran by writing Khamenei a letter with 45 others Rs saying they would kill the JCPOA. https://twitter.com/adamgoldmanNYT/status/988431151026135040 …
Hello noooooooooo


If Obama had a Secretary of State nominee who met with Kim Jong Un and didn't talk about it in his confirmation process, I'm sure the Republicans would have been totally ok with it. https://twitter.com/nedprice/status/986398839392342016 …
Dude, that's because Rex DEplenished the State Dept.
This is nothing to brag about.
#resist #traitortRUMP #tRUMPcrimeFamily

So, our world class State Department was depleted? More like trashed. 

#comradeMitch

Cassandra Butts .. god rest her soul & Merrick Garland. But don’t let politics get in the way of qualified candidates. #HypocrisyLivesOn
Madeline Albright also just wrote a Scathing NYT piece about the Trump GOP ringing in a New Era Of FASCISM.  Did you read those words by the Former Secretary?
another con that is here to destroy America! WAKE UP PEOPLE, #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Anyone you and your gang of thieves want appointed has only robbing the public in mind.
Don't quote her out of context.


No
That would be a big fat no traitor.
No he didn't ahahaha, Manning wasn't pardoned
Where is the link to the speech or article?
There’s no link because it’s another LIE LIE LIE from #TurlteTraitor
Interesting that McConnell now knows only Democrats are trusted by Americans.
Great that he MAY undo damage previously done 2 the vital dept. Unfortunately that still doesn't make him an appropriate nominee 4 SOS. BTW where was ur concern abt understaffing as it was taking place? Oh that's right all efforts were directed toward the @GOP #TrumpTreasuryTheft
majority leader who pissed all over the  constitution he pretends to worship by blocking a sitting pres. right 2 nominate a supreme court justice with 11 months left on his term. Things r so bad these days that u no longer even apply the standard of "would we want this done 2 us?
just like you guys confirmed all Obama's people right. hypocrites.  shame on you.
Looks like @SenateMajLdr is throwing your children into an inevitable ground-war by pushing @MikePompeo_ Don't you think that a an A-Poltical career nom be a better choice @StateDept? Hmm? Why would Tom Cotton think his words would have any impact on us, (@SenTomCotton) ?
This is what happens when we are mafia runs the US government's all branches.   Mafia guarding the mafia boss in the White House from law enforcement.

#ResignMitch
Silence and stop the obstructionist democrats.
Some republicans are obstructing too. Pitiful and pathetic
#GOPCorruption
So make it happen.....
That Sh*%hole Liar Tom Cotton @SenTomCotton agrres ...is he lying again?
Well of course he is.

You were not fond of her so why now are you quoting her? We have had enough of the corrupt cabinet people 4 a long time. If you would stop using the drugs that you are smuggling in, you would know this too.
Your not qualified  to use @madeleine in the same sentence McConnell. How dare you.
Your an obstructionist and a seditionist for 20 years  Whoring for corporation. We didnt elect this majority since 2000
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
We pushed for every Democrat to vote NO on everything you say.
Your an obstructionist not a lawmaker @SpeakerRyan put into office to serve corporatiion.20 years of corporate whoring at the 99%'s expense.Were not sure what to do with the GOPTP Give them 0 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi
no one cares what you have to say McConnell you are not a Real American. McConnells explain why you got a "gift" of millions from a Chinese shipping company.  you wont but you should have to.
She all says to FEAR trump.
Clean up your own state.
Pompeo Great American
She also failed to see the genocide in Rwanda as just, well, genocide.
Hypetcrit
Thanks for bringing illegal torture back. #MAGA #OnlytheBestPeople #Corruption
Of course, you and Tillerson are responsible for State’s current degradation. Stop acting like you are a hero in all this.
#confirmGrenell
NO!  Don’t confirm - just another reputation to ruin!
Was it Pompeo that got burried by Mt Vesuvious or sumthn like that...
Called my Senator to block Pompeo!
Too bad that no one has done so up until now. And, as long as our fearless leader has the last say, I am a bit hesitant to cheer. It's just the way it is.
Pompeo is a war monger along w John Bolton we will be at war less than two weeks. #StopPompeo #StopPompeo #StopPompeo
You left out part where she said that we are closer to fascism than we've ever been....
#MerrickGarland

No thanks.
No
You belong behind bars Mitch no Pompeo no republicans no Trump
Get it done!
Nope
And when I click my heels 3 times doesn't get us back to some sense of normal respectability.


Just because you want him, I hope the Dems hold it up.  Remember SCOTUS



No!  Pompeo does not deserve to be confirmed.  He is a danger to the nation, the rule of law, individual rights and peace throughout the world.  The #GOPTraitors should not confirm him.  #GOPCorruption #VoteBlue2018 #VoteThemOut2018 #Pompeo
Thanks, now retire
It looked as though Corey Booker violated Mike Pompeo's constitutional right to religious freedom with his questioning during the hearing. I have never seen such a line of questioning and wonder why it wasn't stopped.
Are you paying attention to the fire in the White House as democracy falls to the elites and #evangelicals??
Where were you when Tillerson gutted it. You are at the top of the corruption ladder.
you aren't right in the head. seek professional help. you are a lying sycophant.
NO DO NOT CONFIRM
@RobertSteurer
You are the worst.
@RobertSteurer
Where’s our Ambassador to Germany?
@SpeakerRyan  @HouseGOP  @SenateGOP  @NancyPelosi  @SenatorSchumer Maj Ldr, while I do not know Mr. Pompeo except as maybe being too close to another yes man to POTUS45; I also cannot accept a possible recommendation from Sec Albright w/o the full text of her statement!
With hate!
Time to retire turtle
Hey Mitch! What are you doing to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns and killing 49 people?
The GOP is destroying this country!
America has been robbed by this guy long enough, time for a long vacation.
Pompeo is another racist. We don’t need anymore
Did you hear that Paul Ryan - your counterpart - is resigning? 

Just a thought for your future....
You know, I'm getting really tired of you pretending to set records and claim fantastic confirmations. Thank you for doing your job now, but please don't try and pretend the reason for all these possible actions: namely, your refusal to do so much as vote on nominees for *years*.
No.
If Trump would quit firing people you wouldn’t have to find a replacement. Perform due diligence- Do your job - there is no reason to quickly approve cabinet members.
No.
Do you ever read the responses to your tweets?
Why would you work in a job that you have to pay to keep? You could NOT have won by election unless you have the dumbest district going...
Did you hear what she had to say about Trump?

Replenishes the state dept? We are begging for you to resign
"Former secretary of state knows Pompeo is into torture - that's why we want him" McConnell translation
PASS H.R.38 AND KATES LAW THEN RETIRE!! NEW ERA UV POLITICS!!! FOLKS SUPPORT OUR PRESIDENT!!! HES THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN FIX THE HELLACIOUS MESS!!! 2018 LETS VOTE OUT THE DEAD BEATS!!! 1ST!! BUILD THE DAMN WALL!!thx jaroldo!!! FOLKS TIME TO GIT REAL!!! JMO!!! POWTYMAT!!!

Replenish with whom? More corrupt people? I am dismayed at the endless stream of horrible candidates that the GOP is confirming.

That’s funny.
Pompeo and Bolton will mean the endless escalation of mindless "War On Terror" that voters from both parties rejected.
Your job is to push for the impeachment of the president.
Why did Pompeo meet w/sanctioned RU spies including Naryshkin heading RU hacking in US elections? Why did Pompeo not say who else spies met with? Why no q's asked abt these meetings during Senate hearing on Pompeo confirmation? @StateRogue @SenBlumenthal

Please take care of your country. Country over party Mitch. When this is all over if we make it, I think you might go to jail. I hope you do. You and Paul Ryan have given me an ulcer. I think your wife has something to do with it. I think China and Russia got you by the balls!
#garland
It’s true but she has zero credibility. She worked for Clinton who started our problems with North Korea. She’s a drone.
Stop rubber stamping nominations Mitch.

No Thanks, The Guys just Another Swamp Creature with Ethic’s Issues that “MUST BE ADDRESSED” before being allowed to take the position.

Not only no, but HELL NO.
Dont you need putins approval first?
FO you treacherous pos
Since you’re saying it, no. Just say no to McConnell who is blocking efforts to protect Muller.
I don’t think so.
No, Mitch. We will not. Just as we will not leave the Republicans in control. Never forget the Republican created poor that will go to bed tonight without having eaten a good meal, and with no health care. And you're one of the leaders of the thugs that have created these poor.
We despise you,  Mitch.
man you must be hard up for votes if you have to twitter campaign to put a spy in as our chief diplomat, I wonder why...
A Secretary of State who call Islam the nation’s enemy subverts & betrays the mission of the State Dept. Mike Pompeo is a racist & his nomination should be rejected.
Absolutely.
No.

You are derelict in your duty to our constitution
"This president is not in command of himself. He’s obsessed with his own problems. He seethes with rage and resentment for all the world to view—and those emotions are visibly distorting his decision-making." …
