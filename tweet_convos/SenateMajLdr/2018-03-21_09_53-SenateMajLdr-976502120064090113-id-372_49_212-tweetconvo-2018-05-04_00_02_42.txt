No
Yes that is true
Thank you, and we thank God. We know Planned Parenthood and sanctuary cities will be taken care of bc they have done many, many things against the law.
something seems off
Why?  Protecting your wealthy purchasers?
You sir, should be ashamed of yourself. $1.3T and gun control, who do you think pays your wages?
Do away with filibuster and watch things get done fast. You don't need 60 votes to pass good bills.
Hmmmm starting with Reagan,  all President and CONGRESS has cut my VA BENIFITS. 4 YEARS AIR FORCE. Delay enlistment in 1976. Served 1977 to 1981 when joining the service was nothing like today. #forgottenones
too bad so many will go without food, shelter or healthcare while we have the best military in the world.  Hey am I in North Korea???????
Hopefully, both house's get to review this bill before you do your midnight everyone in the dark.
What about THE WALL?? Resign Mitch unless you change the Senate Rules to a 51 vote majority!
And a huge leap forward in debt. Great job! 
Stop subsidizing insurance companies for obamycare
SINCE TAX CUTS MAINLY FOR THE RICH HOW WILL YOU GET THE MONEY NEEDED?  TAXING THE MIDDLE CLASS & POOR. TAKING AWAY MONEY AWAY FROM MUCH NEEDED PROGRAMS?
Stop spending

You cloaked a pork-athon Democrat dream approp. bill with some veterans benefits?!  Why don’t you switch parties and drop the charade?!  You have a clear mandate to fund our border wall and you failed. And you funded murderous PP!?   Awful
Thumping military votes lying hypetcrit
Does it address the problem of domestic gun violence and home grown right wing  terrorists?
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr  if you two don’t pass a budget as is required by the constitution then you both need to be fired!! I did not vote conservative for more of the same, pass a budget with cuts to all unnecessary programs and sen to @realDonaldTrump to sign!!

.@SenateMajLdr, shame on you for exploiting the @DeptofDefense.
Actions speak larger than words.  This budget isn't the one GOP members have promised or campaigned on.  Result, Republicans will be sitting home on Election Day. This Budget has ensured a Dem Speaker in Jan. @GOP @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman
I strongly advise you pull this #omnibusbill back and reevaluate, Mr. McConnell. BIG time. MANY lawful Citizens of this nation are on to the #uniparty. We've had ENOUGH. Budget responsibly.
WE R WATCHING YOU MCCONELL & LY'NG RYAN. Quit pretending after 8 yrs that u give a CRAP about funding DOD. QUIT trying to position this so we dont notice that you are funding PLANNED PARENTHOOD & SANCTUARY CITIES IN THIS BILL. #DrainTheSwamp of RINOS & TRUMP OBSTRUCTIONISTS RT
Yes for the military —full funding of the wall -defund sanctuary cities -defund planned parenthood - approval for Pres Trumps  appointees -1.3 trillion bill ridiculous spending -FIX IT
How much is spent on:
Schumer's "Gateway Project"? 
Planned Parenthood?
Border wall?
Sanctuary cities?

You're neglecting the governing power the US elected in 2016.

#NeverAgain should Conservatives trust our elected officials to do what's right.

#ConventionOfStates
When are you going to hold @realDonaldTrump accountable for not enforcing the Russia sanctions?
Change the rules in the Senate and put together a real budget.  We know that you have personally enriched your family from the Chinese.  Get ready for a Democrat majority!
Stop funding planned parenthood! Stop funding sanctuary cities! Build the Wall, give the full funding, stop giving into the Democrats! #MAGA
And it will bankrupt our country but hey, what does that matter?
Please resign you are in the midst of a corruption scandal
DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD!!!
Russia is destroying our country and what are you doing about it? Big fat nothing.
This sounds like another huge national debt increase.
Stop with the LIES ! Stop the CORRUPTION ! #VetoTheBill
We already spend more than the next 10 nations combined, sounds like we are getting ripped off by the military industrial complex
Do not pass this bill. Full of things GOP PROMISED to change. We will show our displeasure at the polls if this goes through. Inexcusable that nothing ready until a couple days before the 23rd.
Wonderful! More $ for the crooked, thieving contractors!
How rotten you people in leadership!  Only 24hours to read a 2000 page bill spending 1.3 trillion dollars.  Our hope is that it does not pass!
You're a corrupted politician.  Mitch, resign.  You made 20 millions in dark rooms w China. Step down
Wrong.
@POTUS and #majority leader support our President get approval for open positions that he needs filled NOW!!
Not a good Bill! No $ for wall, only fence, hurts 2nd Ammendment, gives Schumer his tunnel. What are you doing? This is SWAMP BILL!
It’s Sad what you and Ryan are pushing on the American Citizens That Voted for @realDonaldTrump This is not the #MAGA agenda!! #BuildTheWall #DrainTheSwamp #OmnibusBill

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenateGOP
You’re a soldier in the Russian war against America. 
Who’s priorities not the American ppl no money for plan parenthood no money for sanctuary cites and we need the Wall. U sir are a swamp creature #fireleadermcconnell #firespeakerryan
Why vote for Republicans since when it comes to spending there is no difference between them and Dems...only Dems don’t lie about reducing spending while Rep do
Liar
It will also contain a huge amount of pork that Americans did not vote for #omnibust
Just what the country needs. More military spending on tha backs of our grangchildren.
@SenateMajLdr  you tweeted the #OmnibusBill has funding for "BORDER SECURITY".  

300 miles of FENCE is NOT the WALL we voted for in #Election2016.
RINO @SenateMajLdr your tweet conveniently FAILS to state the $$$ going to #PlannedParenthood in the #OmnibusBill
Many other priorities?  We’ve been hearing about a lot of concessions & same funding allotted before for border wall-WTH?
Y’all are Blowing up the #deficit!! Sad day
Why are you still funding Planned Parenthood with the new budget deal?
Funny you talk Defence but our military can find recruits to serve. Education is low, morale is low and we don't have heroes we can look up to. But the mind game is at its best Nike, cell phone and clothing that's all young kids see today. Wear  up America !
This budget is the most cowardly document ever produced by Republicans. You currently control the Senate, House, and POTUS what is wrong with you. Shame on you all. I will be staying home in November.  You are not worth the effort.
Why fund Plan Parenthood? You know most Republicans are against the murdering of inacent babies.
It also funds planned parenthood and Obamacare. So tell me again why I vote republican. This is a Democrats wet dream bill. You should be ashamed to pass this bill.
Defund Planned Parenthood. Defund Sanctuary Cities. Build the wall! Stop this Omnibus and vote on GOP House Funding bills! #KYVoter
And take healthcare away from millions of The most Vulnerable
You're cutting #Medicare ? Really? No #American wants this & you'll pay @ the ballot box. Bring on the #2018Midterms
Still, America’s conventional weapons stockpile could destroy the world only once or twice. We can count on the #GOP to wreck a budget for more nuclear weapons. 

#mushroomcloudMitch
Right now Republicans are asking why the heck we bothered to elect all of the Republicans -> you act like the Dems won the election <- Republicans are sick over this appropriations bill and will stay home in the fall.  @SpeakerRyan @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump @SenTedCruz
It is terrible!!!
You MUST CUT PP AND SANCTUARY CITY FUNDING. I DONT CARE IF YOU GO TO A SIMPLE  MAJORITY. GET some BALLS & GET IT DONE.
LIARS! Come on...we gave you House...we gave you the Senate...we gave you the PRESIDENCY...you promised a WALL, defund Sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood, strengthen military, cut waste to reduce deficit.  You also promised bills will be READ and debated before voting. LIARS
GRATE JOB. GOOD YOU CHANGED THE RULES ON VOTING. SO NOW GET RID OF THE FILLIBUSTER ON OTHER LEGISTATION SO YOU CAN GET SOMTHING DONE
stop funding planned parenthood and sanctuary cities. stop excessive spending, cut spending.
Dems must be thrilled with this budget
#1: Fund the wall and DOD!  Terrorism, China, Russia, Iran and NK are scary!! Back President Trump-DO NOT backstab HIM because that is equivalent to backstabbing us GOP voters!!! Trump may not be tactful, but he is trying to protect USA
I hope the POTUS does not sign this crap funding bill that you will be sending to him....I am so disgusted with you. Full funding for the wall! Or does China own you?
You’re willing to fund Planned Parenthood’s murderous harvest of babies! You’re a dispicable Democratic tool! Uphold the oath you took for We the People instead of the damned lobbyist for once! Be the Republican you claim to be, Sir!
Sold out a long time ago
I know. I’m dreaming the SOB might do something for country and not special interest.
I'm starting to wonder what it will take to get people to start recalling their senators and representatives.
Sacrifice a random one in every state, without regard to party maybe!
Maybe NOT!
Build the wall, defund Planned Parenthood and sanctuary cities or resign. It's time to listen to the will of the people.
Build the wall or resign. You are an embarrassment. We spoke, you elitist schmucks ignore us. Can not put into words my disgust with you and Ryan.
DACA.
Advancing the AUTHORITARIAN POLICE STATE!
Why do you support seditious criminals like Robert Mueller, @SenateMajLdr?

@GOP @GOPChairwoman
Too bad you decreased the revenue to pay for it. How does this get paid for? Why are we bombing multiple countries that did not attack us?
You, @SenateGOP are neglecting your oath of office, democracy, Constitution, national security to protect treasonous @POTUS, @GOP! You are complicit; not worthy of serving Americans, THE PEOPLE'S government. #FlipItBlue #VoteBlue2018 #ImpeachTrumpNowASAP

BS Artist Traitors Ryan & McConnell
Well After They're Thrown Out of Office in November
Put in military accountability rather than a blank check. So many programs wasting money just to spend their entire budget.
Really pissed stop passing shit!
$21 trillion US debt.
You are a loser-no proper process-RETIRE Leader RINO! It is NOT a decrease in spending!!!!
@SenateMajLdr - Whose side are you on?What gives with funding Planned Parenthood & Obamacare?Where is our wall? Fund our military,but no new government spending to the tune of 60billion!Are you really a Dem or you just scared of them? Support @realDonaldTrump
Where’s the money for the wall?

100% if you include adults

Yeh, well, I bet you don't even know what's in it.  Jim Jordan doesn't.
We voted for a wall both left & the right have need of illegals in US all of you are beholden to them only POTUS is on our side in this issue we also need to have more confirmations done in Senate for his nominees that’s your job get it done we need  travel ban @realDonaldTrump
We ought to refuse to sign this MammothBill that is hiding the DemocratsWishlist for the next two years.  Let them shut down the government if you must. We need to advance the @realDonaldTrump Agenda, not the Democrats agenda.  You are the majority leader, act it and stop bowing!
Please cut the funding for Planned Parenthood! @realDonaldTrump
What is so important of a billion dollar tunnel between NY & NJ.  I would rather see the money spread across the nation improving and and building infrastructure. Don't take after the Schumer's lead.
Trump administration allows insurance companies to charge higher rates? WSJ https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-pushes-conservative-goals-in-health-care-market-changes-1520377333 … via @WSJ
Already added $1 trillion to debt since President Trump took office.
McConnell is dead set on making Americans pay for trump’s mexico wall. BILLIONS of our tax dollars!
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @SpeakerRyan 

Does this fulfill the promise to everyone who put Republicans into power by
1. FUNDING THE WALL?
2. NOT FUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD?

If not there’s a high likelihood that you’ll lose power come November.

So sad.
BS!  FUND THE WALL!!!
Where’s the money coming from.....benefits for the poor ,middle class and seniors ?
Did you allow any input from Democrats?
Mitch where’s the wall do you really think the Dept of Defense needs more $574.5 billion they got last yr. Do you think 639.1 billion enough for them to make it mayb we should set up some death camps for anyone over 75 so you can have some more to give them
The wall?
Good ! Now, let's talk about you. We need you to call for an END of the phony Russian Collusion investigation by Bob Mueller and his merry band of Democrat donors. #JustDoIt
Ya, no mention here on how you are screwing the people that put @realDonaldTrump into office by not including the wall while still including killing babies and sanctuary cities.  @SenTedCruz @SenTomCotton @DevinNunes @Jim_Jordan @SteveScalise @RepMattGaetz @RandPaul @seanhannity
Traitor taking 2.5m from Putin
...and $1 billion for a NYC tunnel. You are pathetic Senator!
It also funds PP and Sanctuary Cities, stop working for the #Democrats!! This is NOT what the People want!!!
BUILD THE WALL!!!
Build the wall!
Well let's get this straight. You put to death everyone who accepted a bribe on the #goptaxscambill the people who paid the bribes and accepted them through @SpeakerRyan and go to #mueller tell him what you did. PROHIBITION DOESNT WORK IDIOTS. GET A CLUE. IT HAS NEVER WORKED.
Are those other priorities about health care, infrastructure, Medicaid, Social Security, Medicare, income inequality, racism, education, jobs, and the integrity of our elections? Didn't think so.
And DACA?
Great. 21 trillion dollars in debt. Stop paying welfare to illegal aliens
Is that $ being spent to train American men & women in fields that will allow them to succeed once they leave the military? Nope, it is going to the offshore accounts of your contractor buddies whose immoral behavior & wasteful spending aren't being controlled by public oversight
And even more outrageous deficit spending.

PURE B. S.!
Leader, my ass.
We don’t need to increase military spending. It’s a bloated wasteful behemoth that needs to be pared down. Quit throwing money at that monster. Invest in infrastructure first and foremost!
Pass our Judges!  Do your job Sir.
And what about #DACA? Are you going to fail those kids yet again?
Increased funding and trickle down economics, screwing Americans as usual
You do know that OxyContin is made in America by an American corporation- Purdue Pharmaceutical?   @purduepharma. The Sackler family have made BILLIONS $$ off of Americans with their addictive drug. BILLIONS! No wall will stop them - IDIOT!
Wonderful Mitch we all want to reward our military and law enforcement  but the middle class will be responsible for paying for all of it!!!due to the huge saving that you gave to the businesses and corporations #GopTaxScam
We need to get rid of the entire lot! They can't budget anything only make a fortune for themselves and family members! I've had enough!
Republicans are mortgaging our future in every way that they can, so they can steal as much money as possible before their party’s final demise in 2018. How do I know this? It’s the same rhetoric and the same theft games that they’ve played forever. Their history is conclusive.
You screwed us on the wall didn't you!
Why are spending money on Crying Chuck tunnel but not on the wall?  A-Hole.
How about taking a major step forward to build our border wall and support POTUS.
Very concerned about spending on planned parenthood & obamacare!!  Border wall- still only 1.5 billion allottedSafety!!
What is wrong with you PEOPLE? You think a wall is an a swear to what exactly? 1% come by way of that you building a 37,000 ft wall see uneducated people in office. Tell people this is terrible. Oh it's true. MS-13 was formed in the U.S. next. They can climb, drill or dig under
Stop giving away US Treasury to your wealthy campaign donors
Step 1—Cancel the moronic military parade and give the money being used to the military.
All lining the pockets of the top 1%. Anything you pass seems to benefit you financially.
I notice "top priorities" for the @GOP include cranking up the war machine to make $$ for their donors, after #TaxScambill to give massive tax breaks to make $$ for their donors. Notice any $imilarities?! What about healthcare, infrastructure, ANYTHING for the good of Americans?!

Either include FULL WALL funding, elimination of chain migration or don't even bother presenting to POTUS. DO YOUR JOB!!
Also, the American people are open to mailing in donations to build the wall!
Agree!!
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @freedomcaucus another Omnibus piece of crap spending Bill. #EnoughAlready
#DefundPP #FullyFundTheWall #CutEntitlements #ProtectThe2A So fed up with #RepublicRATS
@TPPatriots 
@Heritage 
@realDonaldTrump 
@FoxBusiness
Do your job, grow a spine! We demand protection for Mueller.
When will you defend us from #TrumpRussia because #TrumpColluded?
How about defunding planned parenthood? Putting money up for protecting the border, which includes building a wall and other means of devices that protect Americans from the drugs coming over the border. Defunding sanctuary cities
Don’t vote for this bill if it funds @PPFA and does not fund the Border Wall. @POTUS please Veto this bill if it comes across your desk!
There better not be an #InternetSalesTax, or any #Obamacare bailouts in that bill. #Republicans will be thrown out of office like never before if that happens.  @JohnCornyn @TedCruz
Thanks for running up the deficit yet again.  All you guys are doing is spend, spend, spend.  How is America going to pay for all this?
Your priorities don't mesh with regular Americans, Turtle Man.
Yu Shall deliver to us We the PEOPLE! GIVE @realDonaldTrump $25B in lockbox Now! Build our Wall as Yu and @SpeakerRyan  @GOP +Dems Promised
How ‘bout acting like conservatives and stop wasting our money on things like tunnels... and then failing to secure funds to protect our borders.
You want to help our veterans, stop the endless wars. That will help the opiate epidemic too.



Why isnt $600B in spending for the military enough?  Where is this new money to come from?  More deficit spending?
