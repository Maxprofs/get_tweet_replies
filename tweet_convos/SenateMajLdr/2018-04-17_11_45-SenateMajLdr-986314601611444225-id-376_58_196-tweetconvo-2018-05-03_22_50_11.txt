When is Dictator Trump releasing his Taxes?
Did you file your taxes? Your Great White Hope @realDonaldTrump didn’t and really doesn’t care.
Let me fix that for you. By "unfair, and outdated" you mean the current one that doesn't give away the farm to corporations and the ultra-wealthy, while raising taxes and cutting services to #WorkingAmerica. #VichyGOP #TrumpTaxScam
Merrick Garland
With so many Republicans exiting, why don't you follow suit?
YOU LIE!

You won't live forever McConnell,  no matter what u think. How does your wife like her job that is a conflict of interest?
Good
Really! His simplified bracket plan increased my taxes 15%. Enjoy the billions you signed over to you and your buddies at the top!
This is BULLSHIT! You all are getting rich and us middle class and those who live in poverty will suffer more now. Wish you elected officials can tell the truth!
Where's the post card ?
You literally didn’t fix the complexity at all.
It's doing nothing for me, except maybe cutting social security benefits - so that billionaires can get a tax cut.

Let's bring back the tax code we had in 1979- more progressive NOT the flatter unfair code you just gave us all
The Leader is mortal but his betrayals will live in history forever
Hadn’t heard from you for a bit. I thought you’d passed away.

We'll see.
Shut up
You’re only helping Russia.
Yep, my taxes went up $204 a month. Thanks Bitch McConnell. Loving my tax cuts.
Literally none of this is true.
Tax fraud. GOP swindled the American people.
Yeah, that's what you trying to sell.....pennies compared to your thousands.
Except it isn’t. You can lie all you want but the majority of people got NOTHING. Many, like me, had s tax INCREASE. And you are refusing to offer up a bill to protect Mueller. Your career is finished, old man. Time for you to go.
That is a straight up lie, you know that the individual tax rates will go back up in a year but corporate tax rates are permanent. Tell the truth Mitch.







GFY....now your bs tax reform to help the rich get richer starts.
How about asking people other than your rich donors if the @taxscam is working for them.
0,1% of Americans has more wealth than the ”bottom 90%”. 

Literate people in a democracy should not allow cuts on Corporate Tax, and that is just why #GOP needed Cambridge Analytica to manipulate people.

Obviously you define "American " as the 1%
@realDonaldTrump since this is the historic last time, how about our @POTUS release his taxes? #taxevasion #ImpeachTrump #MuellerIsComing
no help for the average man only the rich benefit and rob the country
Oh please
Will see....see what the Philippines did to me? My mother is in the USA & already a US Citizen. I'm stuck here in the PH w/ this!!!
I guess we’ll see about that. I wouldn’t be declaring “Mission Accomplished” if I were you!

How do you plan on addressing the trillions of $$$ that your #TaxScam adds to the debt? Or do you only get excited about deficits when a Democrat is in the @WhiteHouse? You're a #hypocrite flogging a #TaxScam.
1.5 trillion isnt winning, we owe 1.5 trillion, this isnt trumps fault, the republican administration did this, conservatives no i dont think so!
Stop helping Russia. Help Republicans like Mueller and Rosenstein who the nonRepublican President will attemp to fire. Protect law and order. Don’t be a traitor.
Incase you didn’t notice, they couldn’t file today
How do you know tax reform is working when it has not been put into work yet?
Now get rid of the IRS
Mr. MajLdr, the entire Senate should be ashamed. I’m 65 yr old and all I’ve ever seen is one side obstructing the other. You care more about special interest groups and your vacations. You wait until the 11th hour to get anything done. #Senate has hurt USA.

Dotard



@RepAdamSchiff "Taxes going up next year?  If you’re not wealthy or a corp, you have a 30% chance of paying more taxes next year, higher if you live in a blue state. And your kids will definitely pay much more — the @GOP borrowed from them to lower the corp rate even further"
Pushing out a lot of propaganda today, eh?
Where R Trump'sTaxReturns McConnell? Ucould have requested them but refused 2 Tax Cuts go 2Top1% & Blowup Deficit
McConnell Fails today to be a check on Executive Branch!
Not bringing bill2Protect Mueller!
No One is Above the Law! 
Wait until next year....oh most Ratpulican will be gone....can’t blame them then.
LIAR!!!
A.  IT WAS A TAX CUT FOR THE WEALTHY  B.  TAX CUT BILL STILL UNPOPULAR...BECAUSE IT WAS TAX CUT FOR WEALTHY.  C.  WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DIE?
Yeah, So unfair to expect your 1% OWNERS to pay taxes!
Such lies 
Cut Spending please,  no money to foreign countries for starters.
YA'LL TWEETING THE SAME BS.


We Call BS.
LIES.


This is an x-cellent segment by John Oliver on how Trump and the GOP massively slashed taxes on giant corporations. It's amazing this can get on TV, Last Week Tonight deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of what's possible. https://youtu.be/RKjk0ECXjiQ 
Yeah, we still dont believe you. Our concerns dont matter to you in the least. #ProtectMueller

The GOP tax law gave households making over $3 million an average tax cut of $190,000.

Households making under $12,000 got an average tax cut of $60.

Who do you think you are kidding!!!
You may have some people bamboozeled some of the time, but the majority are sick of your anti American BS
and hello to GOP manufactured trillion dollar deficits.....
and that includes you @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan
Is working for the American people.......who make more than $250,000 a year, the rest of you sold the future of your kids and this country so that fat ass Trump and his cronies could " be a whole lot richer"..... hey Mitch sell your lousy tax cut someplace else
Liar
I doubt it.
Sir, then do something patriotic and noble. Have your president release his previous taxes.
GOP TAX SCAM!!!

Amazon made $5.6 billion in 2017 and paid no federal income taxes. #TaxDay https://www.seattlepi.com/business/tech/article/Amazon-paid-no-US-income-taxes-for-2017-12713961.php …
Thank you! 

BS
Also, the right thing to do for your country is bring the bill to protect the #MuellerTime investigation to the floor. You show a disgraceful lack of interest in doing the right thing.

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
Let me finish for you, *for the American people that are extremely wealthy.
Such bs
Quit selling crap...this is not tax reform it is called Tax Cuts for the Rich...say it as it is.
McConnell is responsible for 2 of the most disgraceful acts in history of US politics: blocking Merrick Garland & killing bipartisan response to Russian hacking. Enabling firing of Mueller would be the third
Oh, it's working alright; I don't know where to spend my $12!  Love your use of the word "unfair"..rich, real rich.  Jerk.
#douchebag
Expect another tweet like this from @SenateMajLdr next nov.7, except he will be talking about those unfair, outdated elections he & POTUS  got rid of to help the American people
You on the other hand are NOT working for the American people #TaxScam #corrupt
What a Snake Oil Salesman!
Right, next year we are Screwed
Tell the bastard @realDonaldTrump to #ReleaseYourTaxes
Where are Donald’s returns? His lawyer have them?
#GOPTaxScam is all about wealthy campaign donor payback! 88% of the tax breaks benefits only the top 1%
Get ready for the major screwing people. The TAX SCAM was written to benefit wealthy people only. Meanwhile the GOP has cut Medicaid and Medicare and is trying to steal money from S.S. to pay for the HUGE tax breaks for wealthy people. YOUR party screwed you!!
Lies. Lies. Lies. Resign.
"American Families" = Corporate Taxpayers?
And the first tax day in 20 years that trumpsky paid american taxes???? Prove it.  Show us his taxes

US wants to know why you held back info on Russian atthacks on our elections.   Party first.  #NoGOPutin
Looking forward to the last day we have to be subjected to these BS #TaxReform tweets.  You blew a giant hole in the budget to serve your corporate and super rich benefactors at the expense of the American people.  We are enjoying our CRUMBS!
Lies lies and more lies
Have you ever told the truth?
And your days, the @GOP days are numbered. The most unpopular tax "cut" in history! Seemingly you've accomplished the impossible! #TrumpCrimeFamily #ImpeachTrump

The #GOPTaxScam went over like rap music at KKK rally. The average American is getting an extra $1,000 on their paychecks per year. The Koch Brothers: $1 Bil. It would take the average American 30 years to save enough to buy a $30,000 car. The Kochs? 91 cars. Per day.996,450 Cars
How do you sleep at night?
@SpeakerRyan  @HouseGOP  @SenateGOP  @NancyPelosi  @SenatorSchumer  Sen Maj Ldr, what you accomplished was a huuuge tax scam that blew 1+ trillion $ of t/p money on big GOP donors, corp stock buybacks & corrupt US Senate vote buying to allow passage.
You, sir, are a LIAR. But you love that Russian money, don't you?
Can you talk to Trump so he can file his taxes on time and then release the information to the American public? Thank you
Spinning doesn't make it so CLOWNS.

Go away please. This country does not want you in office
#GOPTaxBillScam
What purpose do you have for wanting so badly to block legislation to protect Mueller? The things that you consider to be your crowning achievements will go down in history as the things that made you the most reprehensible, unfair, lying SML in our nation’s history. Congrats &
Trump's tax plan should save the largest American companies $150 billion — here's how they're spending that money
Please stop inflating your throat pouch when you speak, all the neighborhood frogs always come running up to my office window
... and added a TRILLION to our National Debt which will be paid for in part by cutting social security and Medicare which will affect all baby boomers and the poor. Thx for nothing you effing #weasel.
While we're at it, it's well past time for @realDonaldTrump to release his taxes.
This year is the last year the gop will be in charge by 2020  they will all be gone with thier pro rich agenda
Fuck you and the 1% you are sucking off, Mitch
It’s a shame the POTUS didn’t get rid if you, BITCHEY MITCHEY, at the same time.  USELESSNESS IS PASSÉ.
#GOPTaxScam
Tax cut riches have gone to execs and investors over workers by nearly 3-to-1 margin
Bullshit. All the GOP has is that ridiculous tax cut, which not only does not benefit anyone but corporations and the wealthy but hurts regular Americans because it is driving inflation. Many of us in the Northeast will experience a tax increase.


Meanwhile the socialists are still trashing your claims of the new tax code creating jobs and benefits. We need a strong communication on this that is irrefutable.
What about the #debt?
Resign already.
I will spit on your grave one day. You are as bad as Trump in destroying the democratic norms in this country.
Hey. Thanks turtle head.
Please retire.
More McConnell B.S. Won't even answer Cavuto's question about ending the cloture rule. Thinks he can just change the subject, shuck & jive and nobody will notice. We all see through his RINO-ness.
He needs to GO now!



Honorable Dude: why cant you at least speak the truth once? The tax code you enacted is no less complex, special interest laden and costly to understand. It favors business. Im grateful but let’s not call it wonderful. Its a boondoggle
MITCH's RUSSIAN LINKED BIG BUCKS:
Yes now they will get to file under an even more unfair tax code that favors the rich
That's awesome!
but please do America a favor for the country and make it a 51 majority vote to pass laws, approve judges and whoever else..
Nope, nope, nope, nope.


Keep flinging those snowballs in Alaska.  Sooner or later someone will be dumb enough to buy one.
Gaslighting!!!

#GOPTaxScam
You mean the unfair, outdated code that permitted high SALT State residents to fully deduct their SALT taxes?
That unfair, outdated code that gave FULL benefits to @realDonaldTrump his family, the 1%ers and Big Corps?
That unfair code?
Darn right unfair.

We have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. It's time to repeal the Trump tax breaks for the wealthy and large corporations and rebuild the disappearing middle class. #TaxDay
Biggest load of shit to come out of party in a long time (after POTUS himself of course).  Thanks for the giant deficit and debt.  When you get Trump to show his taxes, we'll talk.
Hey, you & @GOP are spreading the same bullshit.
Incorrect! The #TaxScam works for your billionaire donors and against the country. Even the National Review has this figured out.

Seen His Yet ??
In the future, rich people and corporations will receive huge unneeded windfalls and the deficit will rise rapidly. There’s very little good about this #taxcutfortherich and you should be ashamed @SenateMajLdr
We will remember this day when you bring the travesty of a budget forward to cut Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and all programs you deem entitlements while you and all members of Congress retain healthcare and pension benefits paid by taxpayers #TaxScam @GOP @SpeakerRyan
