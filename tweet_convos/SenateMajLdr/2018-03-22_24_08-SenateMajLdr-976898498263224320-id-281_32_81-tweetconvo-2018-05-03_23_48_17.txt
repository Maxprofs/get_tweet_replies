"McConnell had barely finished making his fabulist prediction that the GOP tax overhaul would add nothing to the deficit when his fellow Republicans started saying that the deficit will force them to curb Medicare & other safety-net programs on which almost all Americans depend."
My family will pay $12,000 a year more.  Tariffs will increase our costs.  The #GOPTaxScam , welfare for the 1% and corporations, will really hurt middle class families.

The U.S. recorded a $215 billion budget deficit in February—its biggest in 6 years https://bloom.bg/2FEPbgg  
How much did LG&E donate to your campaign? Did any of that go on to line your pocket, personally, Mitch? #Resist #BlueWave
What a piece of shit!
This bill is a disgrace to yours & Ryans leadership. You could have dropped the filibuster & passed it without all the crap in it & given the President money 4 the wall. Instead you chickened out & passed a monster budget bill that everyone hates. You can never be reelected again
Extra money for bottled water!  yay.
Get off you a--!  Get Obamacare OUT!
Get IMMAGRATION reform done!
Stop Messing with OUR President!
STOP OBSTRUCTING OUR PRESIDENT!

Kentucky lawmakers pass tax cuts for wealthy, tax hikes for other 95 percent https://wapo.st/2q8kb1M 

I hope their water bill goes down, since they can't use it.  You are a disgrace to the people who need strong officials to help them.  Kentucky is one of the poorest states and you live like a king and do nothing for them.
Dude, your state doesn’t even have clean drinking water. You have one of the highest poverty rates in the country. It’s obvious you don’t know what you are doing or just don’t give a damn about your people.
If the people of Kentuchy are smart they will dethrone you. you have not represented the American people well. You have not backed our president on what we the people put him in office for. You work for Us. Not to keep power. Rep. party has betrayed us.
Your opinion of this use of taxpayer money?
When traveling on the taxpayer’s dime, Steve Mnuchin likes to take the more expensive option.

How’s that deficit doing??
Got REALLY bad under Obama!!
Hey Mitch, how is your18% approval rating working out for you?
Polls show even Republicans hate you. Among Kentucky voters, your approval rating is just 18 percent the worst of any senator in the country.
When will he be voted out???
The "kids" are eating tide pods
Not fooling US.  National deficit in the tens of trillions thanks to you and yours.  #GOP utin
Mitch McConnell...when are you going to start Working for the American People?
"We"...the American People... pay your Salary!  Stop OBSTRUCTING & GET SOMETHING DONE! WE ARE TIRED OF A NOTHING LEADER! That's why 63 million Americans Voted for Trump!
We will Vote you out!

Crying McCcnnell  when you are spending more in the national budget on interest on the debt than you are spending on infrastructure than you are asking your constituents to pay their hard earned taxes for nothing! You did that!  And you should be ashamed!

Clean water act.
TRAITOR
Many in Kentucky will vote you out if Mueller doesn’t get you first
Please. You are a tease. Can this be possible? Here in Buffalo ny, we will jump in to help get him out.
Implement Trump's agenda or u will b voted out
Such a lie.

NEW POLL: Majority of Americans not seeing change in paychecks from GOP tax cuts http://hill.cm/Z3NyfR3  
LOL
Hooray for Kentucky, but you are supposed to be the Senate majority leader, who should be fighting for funding a Wall to protect American lives from illegal alien criminal invaders, go back home to KY RINO Mitch!

Question:  When is your town hall scheduled?  I don't want to miss it.
RINO POS
You need to RESIGN you disgrace.  #HeyBigSpender
Vote out all Rino’s and Democrats!!
In a trade war? Not likely
Many in #Kentucky want #SensibleGunLaws and @GOP not listening. #Armageddon. @FoxNews Poll: Voters prioritize protecting citizens from gun violence over protecting the rights of gun owners.
*cough* BS *cough*
Well, it has been only a few months since Trump signed the corporate tax cut bill into law, and we’re already learning what anyone with any sense knew at the time:  Everything Democrats predicted is turning out to be right.
We call BS! Liked for you at the March for Your Life today in Louisville. Where in the hell were you, you little wimp?
You are irrelevant. #VoteThemOut2018
All I want from #Kentucky is #YourFiredMitch

Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
You sold us out on the bill Mitch now it's time for all of us to remove the Rhinos from office.We need primaries, remove the old put in the new
Haven’t seen anything Mitch. Your working for the rich - not the people.  #complicitgop #VoteThemOut2018 #NRABloodMoney
Tax reform is working for the people, thanks to POTUS. YOU are not working for us. You clearly have other special interests. #BuildTheWall
#LIES
You're working for Big Business, Coal, and the NRA, not your constituency. You need to go.
When?

These 17 names will always live in my heart. The young men and women of #StonemanDouglas were taken from us far too early. Now their memories are the driving force behind a nationwide movement to end gun violence.
…
#Taxscam #GOPCoverup
Who are you trying to kid? 

The folks on the hollers aren’t on twitter; the rest know better. 
This measly tax break - crumbs for us - will expire in 2020, when lots of folks will definitely be leaving office. 

YOUR ENORMOUS TAX BREAK, like herpes, IS FOREVER.

SHAME ON YOU.
LIAR.
McConnell actually is as dumb as he looks
Perhaps the Millions of Dollars @SenateMajLdr made off of insider deals with China through his wife has influenced his anti-Trump positions in the Senate!  Perhaps the finances of @SenateMajLdr need investigating by the  @TheJusticeDept .. http://bit.ly/2pCRE4U   Filthy Lucre
Robber baron. I hope you implode
This is misleading hogwash.
Fu

Vote Mitch out Kentucky he isn’t for MAGA you can do better.
KY know this, 'Corporate buybacks in the U.S. reached a record high in the first half of February, said Goldman Sachs' Neil Kearns. S&P 500 components are expected to beef up their repurchase programs by 23% to $650 billion in 2018, the brokerage estimates.' #GOPSpin #GOPLies
You just funded baby killers for $500M. I will never vote for a Rino again. Hope you are happy with yourself.
What are you going to tell them next year when their taxes go up?  Talk about the fact that student loan interest is no longer deductible.  That's just one of MANY things you fail to talk about because you are a COWARD.  Looking forward to seeing you in Kroger.
#GOPTaxScam
What about @DukeEnergy ?
When your poop is poking out just a little bit, do you call it a Turtle head?
It does not off-set the scrappy health care cost. You should repeal the %75 Obamacare subsidies that Congress gave themself. Totally unfair to working-class people.
Are you going to hire all the jobless Americans to help you smuggle in the ILLEGAL drugs? We are not all "poorly educated". Do you know that if Putin takes over, all you banana republicans will be killed just as quickly as those of us who oppose you & tramp. HISTORY tells us so.
Poorest state in the country. Now your taking us to war
not if they need health care.
No one cares. We want a WALL. How did your family get so rich when you’re in government?
And is exploding the deficit. I guess you don't care if a Republican is President. Deficits are only bad for Democratic Presidents. #firemitch
It didn't work for me not going to vote for you
Yeah? But now you want this monster 1.3 trillion OMNIBUS. What good is the tax cut when you go out and bust the piggy bank!!!
#VETO
liar
Make lt permanent before Dems persuade you to let it expire.
And the #GOPCorporateWelfare is being spent in stocks, not jobs. Btw, since 1/1/18, over 137,000 workers have been laid off. #GOPTaxScam
Tax reform without any cuts in a runaway democrat budget should bury the next several generations
How nice that you have a single legislative victory while letting idiots like Corker, McCain, Flake, and Graham run amok. Anyone who voted against obamacare repeal needs to be KICKED OUT of the party.
No to #GOP tax deformity!
Distraction won't work.

The #Omnibus is the task at hand.  The @HouseGOP have let us down with this monstrosity of sending billions of our $ overseas for ludicrous projects & taking away our right to privacy. 
We can do better.
#DoYourJob and represent Americans.  #AmericaFirst
You sold us out Mr. McConnell!! Thanks for not standing up for us for once in your career. This Omnibill should've never passed and you know it.
And porn stars are cleaning up!
Wait till next year when they loose the tax break and they have to pay exorbitant healthcare. Your just worried about mid terms. VOTE THEM OUT!!!
And they'll see their kids  pay All this debt you just shoved on them...You are a Traitor to American conservatives.
I ? That, I guess the rich are the only American people
For how long? Tell them

Liar.  Show us how you benefited from #taxreform, @SenateMajLdr!  You rob the less fortunate to enhance your personal wealth.
We’re going to war with Iran. Wake up. You are not doing your job.

BUT, theyre also going to be living in a country with another TRILLION in debt because you have no backbome and no principles!
r u kidding? tariffs with other countries will rise prices in the US and eliminate any tax cuts which have yet to be felt. STOP THIS NUT JOB NOW.  the prez is NUTS. he needs to be put out of office NOW


@SenateGOP @HouseGOP https://twitter.com/JamesFallows/status/976968517986725889 …
How about defunding Planned Parenthood?
lies
Liar
Oh it's working, Moron...
No they won't!!
Mitch Mitch Mitch..... tell us the salaries of the top execs at KY private utility companies and how they cause rates to be higher! The decrease is not tax reform. Only the .01% are getting a bonus.
Good thing they have  little savings there. They can use it to pay the tariffs ....
But the trade war!

And their healthcare gutted.
Nonsense.
You are a Russian agent and very soon, your day of reckoning will be at hand.
what will they get? Another $1.39 a week?
Propaganda machine speaks nonsense
You have lied and done so much evil that when you speak people distrust you first and foremost. You’re like an Auschwitz officer telling people they’re going to shower.
Except when @realDonaldTrump tariffs get responded to and your State’s constituents pay way more for their daily consumables then they are getting back under your Terrible Tax Bill.
You’re as big a propagandist as Joseph Goebbels.
Thanks to our President..
@realDonaldTrump 

Veto the Bill it's not a good deal and you know it.
It's year 2 of 7 years you have time to drain the swamp.
Remain steadfast and we will stand by you. We will vote Paul , Mitch and other never Trumpers out of office.
And then we get to pay off your deficit with our savings... you lying old fool... you got the biggest tax break.. not us!!!!
Please show me all these successes in writing. Would love to see how many avg citizens in ur state are seeing big increases on their weekly pay stub. Ur full of shit. Ur bought and paid for and need to go back into ur shell.  Bad turtle 
Shit. He’s got a date with destiny. A “Day of Reckoning” you might call it.
Save pennies now ... take on trillions of dollars of debt.
I have an aunt in Kentucky who says you are full of s...t. maybe they decreased your bill for helping them become wealthier. When their infrastructure needs repaired they will raise rates high due to lack of regulation. Enjoy your windfall you hack
Kentucky is hurting. You and Chao are too busy cashing in your ill gotten gains to be of help. Vote him out, Kentucky

Thanks in advance for the “Recession” you and your party has wrought on our country.
That’s good because they’re going to see their healthcare bills increase, their insurance bills increase, their social security payments and buying power decrease thanks to you giving all the money to the rich.
Don’t pass omnibus
Your healthcare, however, will skyrocket because I have no balls -Mitch

Wait til he looses leadership. Friend Schumer will reverse because McConnell will not eliminate 60 and do his job. @realDonaldTrump fighting everyday stabbed in back by corruption in senate @SpeakerRyan @SpeakerRyan @rushlimbaugh @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson
You are a disgrace. You lied to the American people and has stabbed everyone in their backs while you’ve gotten filthy rich. Now you’ve help write this omnibus bill. Spending worse than Obama and Dirty Harry. Republicans has majority but Democrats run the Gov. 
Im voting for any Republican , maybe even democrat who runs against you traitor. Sold us out to China !

How many top 1% live in Kentucky. Most Americans will not see a signifigant dofferenve.
Not so for corpotations.
Keep trying, Mitch but you still gave away 1+ trillion $$ to big GOP donors, Corp buybacks & CorruptGOP  US Senate vote buy schemes!
Liar. Take a flying one at a rolling donut. Hopefully the fools who believe you will come to their senses.
Liar! Give it a rest! We don’t believe a word you say!!
HEY MITCH,haven't u got the word that ur trump Republican TAX SCAM BILL isn't working like all u liars said IT'S not a BIG TAX CUT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND POOR AND THAT IT BENIFITS THE RICH COMPANY OWNERS and CEO"s AND UR RICH REPUBLICAN DONORS BY GIVING THEM 95%OF THE SAVINGS
That a pretty vague term there Turtle Boy.
This bill is stupid
Just wait until they see their tax deductions disappear and realize the tax scam is only for the rich.
Changing from the poor to the rich.
You’d be better off not tweeting. Everyone knows the truth, not that spun by the White House and Fox News.
Yeah, because businesses are laying people off. In the long run, it will be disastrous.
You're such a big, steaming pile of garbage Mitch. History will judge you harshly and rightfully so for what you've done to the Senate. Have a blessed day!
Oh Mr. Turtle you can repeat that as long as yp u want the TRUTH of the matter is it is a BOLD FACED LIE! #UnfitForOffice #VoteGOPOut #BlueWaveIsComing

LG&E To Lower Utility Rates Starting In April http://wfpl.org/lge-to-lower-utility-rates-starting-april/ … via @WFPLNews
Did you read the first line of the statement put out by LG&E? "Kentucky residents will see a short-term reduction on their utility bills thanks to President Trump’s tax plan." Here is the link.
You do realize that works out to maybe about $150 between the two utilities for a one year reduction right?  Woo hoo, I cannot pay for one month of utilities with that!
I thought you made the corporation tax breaks permanent!
