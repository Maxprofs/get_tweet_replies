Who cares? Your god Trump will just undo it, same as everything else we've achieved the past 50 years. You need to protect Mueller from being fired before he finishes his investigation. This isn't just a Supreme Court nomination you can block. Will you resign like all your pals?
You are the most useless excuse for leadership in @GOP history. Get out of the way #Resign
You're a disgrace.
You beed to stop spouting bs like “opportunity zones” and face the issues in the wh admin and address them conclusively. Protect mueller and stop protecting yourself and trump. Lead.
Country over Party Bye to you sir you will be voted out
AMERICANS NEED TO VOTE OUT ALL INCUMBENTS! WE NEED A SWIFT AND STRONG LEADERSHIP! NOT THIS CIRCUS! #MAGA
At whose expense??
If you would actually pass some legislation to stop illegal immigration and punish those politicians who aid them we would have more funding to help those distressed areas. Do what we voted for. If you can’t then resign because your worthless. Get with modern times.

but isn’t that just another version of supply side theory? Why not eliminate taxes completely or as the Georgists advocate, a land value tax?
Can you count to one Trillion? I doubt it #GOPTaxScam #BlueWaveComing2018 #GOPTraitors
Why does twatter say you deleted this tweet?
then build your own platform snowflake. you poor trumplickers sure complain a lot while innovating at absolutely nothing except creating more poor stupid white people.
What in the name of Zeus' asshole does that have to do with this topic? Did you build this platform soyboy? No, of course, you just saw an opportunity to pop off that uneducated mouth.
I was replying to your inbred compatriot’s comment. I know it’s tough for you guys to follow along or even play by your own rules (i.e. your tangential comment). Sorry for making fun of your boyfriend. I’m sure you’re very nice in real life.
Bless his heart. His sentence structure alone, says inner city education, & his continued dumbassery says cared for by the state.
Ditch Mitch, the sonofabitch.
Meanwhile people in Kentucky can't drink the water.
Bring the Protect Mueller vote to the floor.

@SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley @SenThomTillis @LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader 

I support @ForTheRuleOfLaw. It is time to #ProtectMueller — your jobs…
You need to call for Mueller's firing if what he did was unconstitutional as you said it was !


Every criticism of the Republican tax plan is proving true | MSNBC http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/every-criticism-the-republican-tax-plan-proving-true …
Traitor
If you guys vote to protect Mueller I will stay home in November! I’d rather have Nancy Stab in Michigan then continue to support the likes of gutless people. I’ve had it with the GOP after the budget and ANYTALK of this and I’m done with the GOP!
Thank you!

Pathetic old man.
McConnell refuses to allow vote on bill to protect Mueller http://hill.cm/seBdIhz  

Gov Kasich of Ohio said he’s not fixing roads. So we cut taxes and cut road repair at the same time. Sounds like a winning combo come November 2018.
Dont want to hear about tim scott, trump is going to destroy the republican party forever, your tweeting about scott, why arent you doing something before its to late, do you believe the people are going to let you get away with it! REALLY! Is this something in the dc water!

When it's over, when the United States that you and I knew is dead, this guy -- this this dirty rotten son of a bitch right here -- will be the one most responsible. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/983846105594187776 …

There is no indication that Trump will fire Mueller except:

1. That time he ordered the White House counsel to fire Mueller…

I am embarrassed for Kentucky. People from there I know think hid betrayal of our President is disgusting. He slow walks everything and is responsible for hurting Americans by refusing to support our President. #DitchMitch

You mean the taxscam that gave billions to the 1% with no strings attached? The scam that gave a time limited pittance to the poor and middle class AND a HUGE deficit to pay back over the next decades? That scam?
I'm sure you'll feather your nest a bit more potato face
He’s trying to stay in office.  Nope
Are you still trying to fool people into believing this was anything but a #GOPTaxScam .
They're on to you, Mitch.
Tax breaks for the rich has cause our country to have an exploding to a ONE TRILLION debt by 2020. Where is the money going to come from to pay for anything else? CUT Medicare or Social Security??? Is that the plan???
I assume you have heard the latest news #MitchMcConell ? And will you and #PaulRyan still continue to block Congress from protecting #Mueller ? This must be a very tough time for you Mitch..decisions, decisions, decisions !!!
Exclusive:  Handwritten notes we believe were written by Dana Boente on his talking with James Comey about the "cloud" of the Russia investigation:

McConnell refuses to allow vote on bill to protect Mueller http://hill.cm/seBdIhz  

You lie!
Apparently, you have no respect for the rule of law when it applies to Republicans.

For once get off your lazy ass and pick country over party protect Robert Mueller!
Yes and without DJT it wouldn’t have happened. Tim has acknowledged that. Mitch you have failed our party with your refusal to support DJT. YOU don’t have to like him we do. He is wanting to do great things for us you allow the democrats stand in the way. What is wrong with you?
You are an unhinged RINO! Support the duly elected President!
Geez, I guess u can hide behind this until u slash medicaid, social security and medicare too, to pay for ur tax reforms and runaway deficit.  That was the plan, wasn't it? "Opportunity zones" will get cut too, cuz they won't fit with ur balance budget crap.  #Midterms2018
Are you going to back the American people if he fires Mueller?
We need a bill to protect the special counsel now!! #RussiaGate #MuellerIsComingForYou Do it now or the senate flips democrat and you’re out of a job soon!
BS Mitch
protect Mueller
How about you and Speaker Ryan start supporting our President. The two of you are a disgrace to Conservatives and our country.
Don’t believe a word of it. You better 
straighten up your own house before you support an absolute corrupt & criminal president who breaks the rule of law everyday. How about reading Meachums biography of Jefferson. Trump is what Jefferson,Hamilton, Franklin 
& Madison feared...
...the most. An unhinged corrupt President would be crazy dictator. But they counted on Congress to check him My former party has done nothing to reign him in as he 
breaks the rule of law everyday, never divested, has many business 
comnections to Russia..
I was under the impression that wanted to protect yourself. Don’t think you aren’t under scrutiny for all your dark money connections
...As for Mueller you let Trump take him down & their may be a 2nd American Revolution. Trump lies everyday to America & you want to rush more Trump approvals thru. You’ll only be putting more criminals in office

That would be lovely....but REALLY....are you personally overseeing this program? Cuz if not just more gop Comrade trumpski lip service #GOPlipService
I have an idea— how about impounding funds from that disastrous Omnibus?
Rot in hell, sellout! You will be a footnote after progressives rebuild this country and our place in the world.

Mitch, all you care about is slush money in politics. You sold America out when you fought tooth and nail against Campaign Finance reform. You belong to the oil and coal barons, stop pretending there is anything patriotic about it!
Jeff Sessions "AG" you should "resign now" you are corrupt.
#Complicit party over people
So low pay jobs, or jobs in industries like renewable energy, bio-tech? Does it include education, scholarships for training for high paying jobs, consideration for infrastructure? Of course not
#confirm @RichardGrenell
The government should never play favorites. Tax consumption not income. @FairTaxOfficial
Mitch you and your Chinese spy wife Elaine Chao need to be tried for treason and selling out the company to your Chinese Masters
Would not have to worry about that if you had not passed #TrumpTaxScam where $$ goes to the rich & nothing to the poor. #VoteThemOut #BlueWave2018
This tweet had to be exhausting for you, I think another months recess is in order.
Back our President.
You have no idea how much of a tool you are. So sad.
Great. More taxpayer money used for corporate welfare. Stop picking winners and losers. If you feed cats, more will come. STOP THE WELFARE TO CORPORATIONS.
Corporate tax cuts are a good thing.  Since the tax bill was signed, I've received additional bonuses that totaled over $150,000 and an average increase in dividend payout by 14%.
This message Has been approved by Tim Scott .
McConnell you better not have nothing to do with this stuff that Muller pulled
GO CONFIRM SOME PEOPLE MITCH!!!

We Tim Scott in SC!
Did you get permission from Chuck and Nancy to say that??

Your accountants, and of course the IRS, are much more interested than I. 

#Mitchgetsrich
And those and our giant GOP tax cuts for the wealthy plus trillion dollar deficits will be brought to you by: cuts in social security, Medicare, Medicare, CHIP, disability insurance and welfare!
Why haven’t @realDonaldTrump Appointees been approved?!
Do something NOW to protect the special council or risk your career and reputation.

That’s FUNNY NO WHERE TO BE FOUND WHEN IT COMES TO TRUMP AND HIS ISSUES, WE GETIT, YOU ONLY NEED HIM TO SIGN OFF BUT YOU AND RYAN QUICKLY FLY THE COOP WHEN SOMETHING COMES UP LOL KEEP DOING THAT
How’s the leader of the Republican Party, President Trump doing?  Are you out there supporting him Senator?
Good thing the DoJ is honoring their oath of checks & balances, unlike the Republican-majority House & Senate...
ARe you going to protect the #RuleOfLaw or are you part of the demolition of democracy?  #RepublicansWithoutBalls #RepublicanComplicity #RepublicanHyprocrisy


Buybacks are good.  I've made over $356,000 from buybacks since the tax bill was signed.  If you're jealous then stop being a victim, take personal responsibility for your life, and work harder so you can be wealthy like me.

You might have been able to work 40 hours a week but if you were only working 40 hours a week, you probably couldn't give your family a life of luxury.  Reagan took me from $65k in 1980 to $520k by 1988.






Kentucky 2nd highest welfare state in the nation. Paying in far less than they take out.
you need to get up and start helping our @POTUS and get busy putting America first.  #2Amendment #FreeSpeech #Constitution #BillOfRights #Freedom #liberty #BuildThatWall You may hide now but the voters will find you on election day. Patriots are rallying for America #MAGA
Yeah right, you helped all those wage earner in KY with your #TaxScam giving $1.5. TRILLN to the richest Americans and cutting corp tax rate from 35% to 21%.  How much money did you take from RU passed thru NRA?

#ProtectMueller
So what?  Why shouldn't us 1%ers be allowed to benefit?  If you're jealous then stop being a victim, take personal responsibility for your life, and work harder so you can join me in the 1%.

Correction Turtle...GOP TAX SCAM THAT ONLY BENEFITS THE RICH AND CORPORATIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS!!!
If you're jealous then stop being a victim, take personal responsibility for your life, and work harder so you can be rich like me.  By the way corporations are basically people.  Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people.
You state is poor because of people like you
Yeah DIRTY @SenateMajLdr & Scott r working to take Our President out of office!!!

Move on Mitch... maybe border security ???
#BuildTheWall and support our President's America First plan you Corrupt, RINO foreskin.
May I suggest you get your eyes checked! 
Complicit!

You and your party are setting back Kentucky for years for the middle class and the poor all to favor big businesses and your wealthy donors. Your teachers are in distress and you could care less. The entire gop needs to be voted out.  #GOPTaxBillScam #GOPCorruption #VoteBlue2018
Corporations are basically people.  Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people.
Small business will surely benefit from these tax breaks.
You ain't fit to run a table at the Flea Market.
Not for me! When I work from home and now I cannot deduct anything is pretty crappy! You scammed a lot of Americans with your fake tax break!
Probably no thanks to you Mr. Majority Leader!!!

“Special tax treatment”.? You would know all about that.
How ABOUT the people on Social Security we could use YOUR help. I worked for 46 years to get this benefit

No thanks to you, oh grand high wizard of the swamp.

Fantastic! Thank you Senators!
That’s it Mitch try making us believe your tax reform for the rich is working for the poor. You’re out next election. Be writing that concession speech. Better yet do us a favor and resign...also take Ryan and Trump with you.
You dragging that out again? #TaxScam is still benefitiing the Corporation, criminally corrupt (how much are you lining your pockets with?) and the already obscenly rich!
Corporations are basically people.  Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people.  If you're jealous then stop being a victim, take personal responsibility for your life, and work harder so you can be rich like me.
Let me guess - Republican and Christian, right? I have been working this last 30 years, dear, that doesn't mean I'm blind to what's going on around me and who is at fault.

Your job is to push for the impeachment of the president.
While you steal their Kentucky Care... (aka Medicaid, aka The ACA , aka Obamacare ......"say whaaaa? You mean my Ketucky Care is REALLY Obamacare?? "  )
NOW GET PRESIDENT TRUMPS CABINET FILLED!!
Mitch when are you going to do your job and get the nominees through the Senate that this country needs? You are a disgrace to the office and should resign and less you can get the job done now!
"Special" tax treatment.....
wink-wink.
You're responsible for not pushing the President's appointees through the Senate... You have the power, but refuse to use it... You're as bad if not worse than the dumbocrats!!
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS!!!!!!!
Giving away our money won't keep you from losing your job. November is coming.
Yep McConnell...just ignore the insanity going on in the white house. If you ignore it, it is not really going on. How about a little talk on Kentucky's fine Bourbon's, for your next Tweet. Or better yet you and your boys put a stop to this nightmare?
Retire
Well that tax reform is certainly giving us a huge annual deficit at a time when we should be leaning toward a balanced budget. But...hey, fiscal probity just isn't a GOP thing.
Clearly with a trillion dollar deficit we need to cut even more taxes
These 'opportunity zones' are only opportunities for businesses.  And all data has shown this method of wealth redistribution is ineffective at lifting all boats. 

Trickle down does not work. Want proof, it has not worked in 40 years.


Are you aware of your surroundings??
How much was your tax cut sir
Alzheimer’s McConnell tweets again...
You’re talking teapots while we’re battered by a tempest
Mmmmmm   can just smell that bacon cookin'

19 of Trump's very fine people have been charged with crimes. 5 have plead guilty. 1 has been sentenced to jail. Trump's lawyer raided by the FBI & Trump U settled lawsuits for $25M yesterday. 

Why do YOU refuse to protect the FBIs multiple investigations?
I bet he has his hands just as dirty and will soon be LOCKED UP TOO !!
You know what the good will win over this evil man .Let him refuse to protect.The FBI is protecting us from dirty rotten eggs like MITCH!
STALE Tax Reform LIES ?

Current News:

It’s sure as heck working for you and your rich cronies, right Mitch? The rest of us, not so much.
If you're doing such a great job Mitch, why are there so MANY economically distressed areas in Kentucky? The demise of coal has been recognized and reaffirmed for decades. This wasn't inevitable.  You listened to your coal donors rather than your constituents and economists.
Russian Bot Account
What about the current situation with @realDonaldTrump ? No comments? Not going to stand up for America you shill?
He needs to stand with us the people who can't wait to vote him out !!!!!!!
GOP has lost sight of the values, needs, and wants of the American people, but elections will send that message.  What is really sad is GOP has lost sight of it's own values and demeaned the party, it may never recover.  Toxic McConnell, no leadership there.
If the economy is roaring why is the number of homeless increasing so dramatically?
No it's not unless you are wealthy and you are senator but the voter's of Kentucky are not so it's  working  for you not your voters

WHY ARE YOU NOT SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT WHO WON THE ELECTION? ARE YOU AFRAID FOR YOUR JOBS?
#GOPTaxScam You must think Americans are stupid. You're the corrupt clueless leader of the Senate, probably the first in history. Proud of the legacy your memory will invoke?
Like MANY in KY? Why is that sir? How long have you been their Senator? Why is YOUR state in the lower ranking on every major stat that matters? BECAUSE @GOP policies never have and never will work to raise people out of poverty! The Cat 5  is coming sir...swimsuit ready?
Policies work if judiciously elected representatives (not Mitch) execute them and measure their effectiveness.
So what’s his next hashtag. #keepyojob #takingyomoney #kissmybooty #imyobitch #fckyomama  Please keep me informed.
Unless you're a farmer...or a teacher..or a coal miner..or a *insert title here*
Only because you got caught lying right? it's still #GOPTaxScam 
Lies. You run on our issues, but come time for votes you do the opposite.
grow marijuana and make shine...
#Complicit #spineless #spinelessthe people will not forget where you stood on the side of history.
