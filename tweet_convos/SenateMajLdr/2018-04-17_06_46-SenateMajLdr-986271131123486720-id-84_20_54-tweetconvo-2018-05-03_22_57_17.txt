Is every republican on cocaine? You were all sent the same talking points and repeated them faithfully.                Lies.

BS
Don't know who you're trying to fool. I haven't seen squat.
#TaxScam Rising Insurance Costs, Energy, Housing, Capped Deductions for HomeOwners and an experation date for the middle class
Sad that our descendents will paying for the deficits you've created forever.
You’re full of crap!

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
Repeal the trump/GOP tax scam
Lying all the way to the bank, aren't you traitor?

Amazon made $5.6 billion in 2017 and paid no federal income taxes. #TaxDay https://www.seattlepi.com/business/tech/article/Amazon-paid-no-US-income-taxes-for-2017-12713961.php …
What about those that have substantial unreimbursed employee expenses which are no longer allowed ?  Per diem for days away for work, union dues , tools for mechanics, mileage for work travel - taxes will increase for these people.
Lies, Richy Risch.
Enough of this GOP tax scam campaign. This cut was to benefit wealthy donors in trade for added or continued campaign donations. Elected officials for sale to highest bidder. TRILLIONS of added debt harms entire Nation to benefit the top! Not buying 'spin'!
So sad it is true.

Stormy Daniels reacts to Pres. Trump's denial he knew anything about $130,000 payment made to her: "I work in the adult business and I'm a better actor than he is." http://abcn.ws/2CcjBVI  
Now secure that boarder
You take credit for the tax cuts when Trump did it. You will be out as speaker of senate when we elect many more in Nov. GET RID OF FILIBUSTER NOW. Pass bills that our President needs. Get nominations cut to 8 hours tops. Get his people seated to help him & You
#PresidentShithole didn’t create tax cuts, the corrupt @GOP did.  Cheeto made suggestions and he hates some of the changes and wants them fixed.  There will be changes in November, #ABlueWaveIsComing 
TurboTax postcard 1040 will take as much data and entry as the current 1040. Will NOT be easier to do! Only dumbasses would believe that.
Say hello debt
I’m not rich like you two boobs. My hard earned money will be going to you for your frivolities.
We will see come 4/15/2018. Right now all your doing is blabbing bs propaganda. I for one will be paying MORE in taxes.  Already had my accountant do a pro-forma for 2018 based on 2017 income. Is my income not "hard earned" enough for you?
4/15/2019
Did trump make all of you weasels tweet positive  ???
Bc my answer to ALL of you "MrGoebbels" is...
Just bc y'all REPEAT A LIE doesn't mean we actually have to Buy it or eat  w/ a spoon
Yes the day the wealthiest Americans and corporation receive a tax break off the backs of the poor. That is something the GOP will own. So much for being fiscal conservatives who increased the national debt by over a trillion dollars
Same DRIVEL and LIES coming from MITCH the TURTLE.
SHAME ON YOU!

All you Republicans giving yourself a pat on the back for tax reform. Well it's going to back fire on you. As soon as you try cutting entitlements, social security, medicare and medicaid, You'll probably see a revolt unlike any other. Keep that in mind.
The last day anyone gets a dependency exemption for their children.  Congrats on taking from the average American to give to the rich.

LIARS!

#TrumpTaxScam



IDIOTS!
Welcome to the first year coming; filing the new and EXACTLY THE SAME - complex, full of same loopholes but much less beneficial tax return and tax system! Except if you are wealthy that is. The McTurtle 2017 GOP tax bill is as corrosive as other 3-times the GOP tribe tried same.



Snake oil

I'm not surprised people haven't been noticing the TCJA in their paychecks. Even if everyone adjusted their withholding perfectly, more than half (56%) of families would see a tax change of $20 or less (including a…
Our taxes will later rise, to pay for the deep cuts the rich received.  Are you obtuse, or merely another @GOP twat who thinks Americans don't pay attention?
#GOPTaxScam







@GOP donors celebrate the #TaxScam of the decade! 

Call it tax reform... the commoners will totes believe it! 

Tax Reform hose all of us hardworking Americans.

Your Billionaire donors are happy though...

What a joke. The #GOPTaxScam takes from the poor and gives to the rich and corporations. And those corporations have already used most of their tax cuts for stock buy backs. 

You added trillions to the deficit to pay off the wealthy donors. SAD!
That's strange. Our tax person said we"d receive NO benefit from new tax plan and may, in fact, pay more. #ThanksForNothing
Didn't you get your crumbs yet?
Tax $$$ goes to schools, roads, public utilities, etc.  now they go to Trump Golf & Military expansion only.

Why have a strong military if he citizens they’re protecting are suffering?
