Your imagination needs serious work.
His political courage and manhood also need some serious work.
Liar
You have a limited imagination, don't you?
Hillary was confirmed by the Senate to be Secretary of State with a 94-2 vote even after a career of corruption, failure, and scandal.

Mike Pompeo has had more success in one meeting with Kim Jong Un than Hillary has in all her years of public service.

Confirm him
#Pompeo #MAGA
Doesn't Mike Pompeo call himself a veteran who fought in  the Desert Storm warzon?
Correct, but there have been questions as to if he was deployed as he had stated.
Retire Mitch.. whichever way you want to.. but just retire
How are those rubles spending, Mitch? #GOPComplicit https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/15/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns …
What is hard to imagine is you being anymore partisan than you are.Your actions have consistently shown you willing to put party over country and over the will of the majority of voters. I will say one thing. Pompeo is as much a patriot as you are....so I guess he has that.
I know one. Merrick Garland, Chief U.S. Circuit Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, DC Circuit. Ring a bell?
A government run by lying bigots pursuing a hate agenda & borrowing trillions from the next generation never made any country great again.
#GOP
#Kleptocracy 
#warmongers
Your integrity in tatters as you scrape and bow before Donald Trump.
I think since it's a election year we should wait for new congress!!!!
Merrick Garland.
Actually I could rummage through my compost bin and find better nominee than Mr. Pompeo.  Maybe a rotten apple core that hasn't lied about it's military record.
He is NOT qualified in the least bit..NO
How about Merrick Garland for SCOTUS, how about HRC? She was pretty qualified!

Oyez! Oyez!
Same can be said for Merrick Garland.  Your agenda to protect personal power at any cost has weakened democratic institutions and the nation.  Those who value ethical leadership will not treat you kindly in 2018, 2020, and in the history books
That’s because you lack imagination, Mitch.
Goes to show your lack of imagination, and leadership.

I'd hardly say it's hard to imagine a better nomination?! I can't imagine anyone would think Pompeo would be a good Secretary of State. Let's start draining the swamp with Pompeo.
#DrainTheSwamp
Delusional, he lied about his service,that alone should get him felony prison time and you to Mitch ,you know better maybe you need some prison time,It can be arranged! !!-
Actually it’s not hard at all...
Just get the full confirmation vote of Pompeo scheduled & done. You have two Dems so you should be all set. Nobody cares if @RandPaul decides he's going to showboat again for his next Presidential run.
I don’t think that’s Paul’s motivation. He’s just a purist who doesn’t work well with others.
Perhaps, but as the saying goes, "perfect is the enemy of good". If Rand is this intractable then that's a liability for any future POTUS run...
I agree. I’m not defending him. He’s unacceptable. If he can’t play with others, he’s not suitable to be President. He’s not suitable for a lot of other reasons as well.
Pompeo will be a nightmare. You have been bought and sold long ago. Resign.
Uh, a nonliar would be good.
Leaders get things done! Harry Reid was a SOB but he got things done for his president! You are ONE of the reasons Americans don't trust Congress! No action! Get appointments done and quit screwing around.. Republicans in power or NOT??
Sure. You DA. He shouldn't have fired his prior SOS. #UnfitForOffice #UnfitToLead #TrumpResignNow #VoteGOPOut #BlueWaveIsComing
Hillary Clinton!

Because who cares if he says he fought in the Gulf War, when in fact he didn't. Par for the course with your lot.

What's hard to imagine is that there was a better SCOTUS nominee than Merrick Garland.
You better make sure he gets confirmed today!! And what is the hold up on our presidents nominees it's two years in and he still doesn't have his nominees confirmed do something about it Mitch!!!
I can imagine MUCH better.
Now bring a term limits bill to the floor and give this country a fighting chance for a future.
Not Really Try To Imagine HRC  You KY ASS-CLOWN
Than, you have no imagination.
How can Senators who voted for HRC and John Kerry for SoS, NOT vote for Pompeo?
They hate Trump more than they love their country. Pathetic.
Really? I have no trouble at all imagining a better nominee. You suffer from a serious lack of imagination.
Wow - you sure don't have much of an imagination. #NoPompeo
You need to start being the majority leader and move all of #POTUS #NOMINEES through instead of letting #Schumer  and Dems call the shots!
Trump is a fraud. Remember Trump University. Fraud !! @RepAndyBiggsAZ @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @dougducey @SpeakerRyan
I have no doubt that you would support another liar like you.
You don't have a very good imagination, do you?
Hard to imagine? You are speaking for yourself.
You must have a very limited imagination.
No senate breaks until EVERYONE IS CONFIRMED!

GO NUCLEAR NOW AND WIN SUPER MAJORITIES IN NOVEMBER

ARE YOU DAFT?

#MAGA #KAG #Trump2020 #ComeyInterview  #NRA #2A #NoKo #Comey #EarthDay #WaffleHouse #KanyeWest #CandaceOwens #sundaymorning #RedNationRising #Toronto #Nashville
Super majorities in November? The will be lucky to hold the majority. Lol.
Hahaha hahahahahaha
Let me correct that for you.  "It is hard to imagine a worse nominee..."  Of course, if worse can be found, I'm sure Trump can find them.
Really? That just proves you have a massive lack of imagination. #StopPompeo

.Go nuclear! This whole thing is fgetting ridiculous!
Except perhaps just about anyone.
Who are you kidding?!  If you want to say he’s your friend that is one thing but to say he is the most “thoroughly qualified?!?!  You look absurd.
Kinda like MERRICK GARLAND!!!

Time for more 'Roper dope... : (
I can imagine better choices than someone who denies the Russian interference in the election and who also lies about his military service in the Gulf War.


I know typos are common and even acceptable coming out of the cesspool @WhiteHouse these days, especially with the dip shit @realDonaldTrump leading the charge, but u misspelled "easy". It's not spelled "hard". I know how tough life is for ya wo morals, so just helpin where I can
We can imagine a lot more talented people to represent the US

Sir, with all due respect, you need to work on your imagination.

What is wrong with you?
Not really. I’ve imagined several.
Don’t celebrate adding to the criminal swamp turtle boy.
Really, have you seen my dog's ass?
OFFS! Are you serious! There is a special place in hell for you!
Term limits
McConnell needs to get new batteries for his imagination.  The ones he is using don’t seem to be working.
What difference does qualification make? You guys have rubber stamped just about every imbecille with a pulse that he put in front of you. Now we have the not only the most corrupt president in history, but also the most corrupt cabinet! The GOP is destroying the country.
Now do @RichardGrenell
"It's hard to imagine a better nominee or someone more thoroughly qualified that Merrick Garland"
#StolenSeat
#STOLEN

It was pretty hard to think of a better Supreme Court Justice than Merrick Garland. Remember him? We don't always get what we want. Stop being a profiteering hypocrite. #BlueWave
Anyone would be a better nominee.  Just like your position...anyone would do a better job . My sister is the Vice President of her daughters PTA. I think I’ll write her in.
#ConfirmPompeo @RandPaul just cause you don’t like Mike Our @POTUS deserves his choices! Quit obstructing American choices Your looking  like DemoRat swamp creatures!  Get onboard @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain or get out of our way for possible solutions DeNuke Korea

Make it happen Mitch! The Senate needs to support our President. You also need to get the confirmations done. This is ridiculous that or President does not have all his choices confirmed.
My dog would represent us better. 

Resign traitor.
No actually it’s not. He is a Koch brothers’ puppet just like you, so your endorsement comes as no supprise. Your legacy will include destroying our democracy and rule of law for personal profit and power. History will not be kind to you traitor.

Why don’t you retire ?
Really. I’m having no problem whatsoever.
My question Senator is what are you doing to get this very qualified candidate for Sec of State confirmed?  As the Senate Leader you need to look at and revise the “Rules”. Enough with this Resist Movement orchestrated by the Dems and allowed by the Republicans.
No...it’s really not that hard to imagine a better nominee...actually quite easy...but he will be confirmed
Mitch, have you lost your imagination? Pompeo is a liar and a bigot.
Imagine harder.
why don’t we see how well he did with secret meetings with North Korea, as a test run, before we commit?
...............MAGA............

DUMP McCONNELL

DUMP TRUMP

DRAIN THE SWAMP
Agreed. Now how about confirming @RichardGrenell!?
Seriously you need to make all stay 24/7 till all potus nominees are appointed period......

You need to retire you old crook.
Shame on you, McConnell. Your too long career in Washington ends with an indelible black mark. You protected a criminal POTUS and placed party before country. You are a man without honor. Your name will forever be associated with disgrace.
Resign already!
I can imaging about a hundred other better qualified candidates.  We don't need the lapdog to the most embarrassing president to represent us to the world.
Please bring to floor national gun reciprocity.  Please fund $20 billion for wall.  Thank you sir.
actually,  no, not hard at all.
Seriously, Mitch - what does @realDonaldTrump and/or the #Russians have on you?  Pompeo is the most unqualified, inappropriate nominee for SOS EVER.  He lied about his military serve, destroyed Kansas and openly hates gays.  Nice way to offend the whole world! #NoPompeo
Hard to imagine? No. It’s easy af.
Sir, you are the Senate "Majority" leader. Damn the RESISTANCE...full speed ahead. If you can't, sir, then get out of the way.
Mitch McConnell has enriched his life with corporate money and favors. His wife has a big job in this administration and he is not in Washington to do the business of the people. I say that a middleclass or working poor person would do a better job.
#ApprovePompeoNow
Gosh, Mitch. I don't think it is difficult at all to find a better nominee.
Merrick Garland?
That’s because you have no imagination. None.
kind of like Merrick Garland was great choice for Supreme Court Justice? hope Dems draw this process out forever. you are a hypocrite, obstructionist, and vile human being who only cares about himself. you need to be voted out of the Senate or better yet, indicted for corruption
#CONFIRMMIKEPOMPEO  !!!
Like Merrick Garland
Merrick Garland.
VOTE Pompeo!!!
Absolutely. Please work on your GOP senators to support Mr Pompeo NOW!!!!
You mean just moving from one, unrelated department to another? Really?  Please!
Get his people confirmed!
McConnell be a leader
You tell them for me - anyone who votes against Mike Pompeo is a jagoff. 

(Proper usage, @SalenaZito?)
Why isn't @RichardGrenell confirmed yet? It's an embarrassment. You have the power to confirm him. This is on you, Senator.

Wrong!! There are a lot better choices.
Pull your head out of tRumps backside!
It’s really not that hard to imagine a better nominee, or POTUS, or Senate Majority Leader...
Did you have NyQuil for lunch? #Pompeo #TrumpRussia
Republicans voted for Clinton and Kerry, they did not like or agree with them, but they knew each administration is entitled to a team of their choosing and respected that
I call bullshit
That's because he's a co-worker of yours under the employment of #Koch Industries.
Why does McCain still have a seating the senate?? He has been absent from work for 5 months!! America deserves a working senator from AZ!! He needs to be replaced!! He can't do his job!! You guys in DC need a reality check! Normals can't keep jobs they don't show up for!!!
Stop sucking up to your wife's boss.
You have a country to answer to, not to mention Kentucky.
Today a bunch of Republicans will vote to confirm a valor thief, torture apologist and warmonger to the State Department to be our chief diplomat.
Then you’re not really thinking too hard.
You’re just trolling now
Its hard to imagine a more corrupt, lying , piece of shit as Senate Majority Leader, who is less qualified to ever serve in the Untied States Senate than you
Trump, McConnell and the Republican's are ruining this country. #NoPompeo

Do you trust Trump?
How do you guys sleep at night or even look at yourselves in a mirror?? Conservatives have been on the wrong side of history for every major individual & group rights fight we've ever had in this country. Now your selling your souls for the likes of this narcassist Trump??...
Blue wave going to displace skill-less Republicans all across the country. Thanks Trump!! Can’t wait to see you and your cabinet (family) all in prison either. And contrary to fox mews there will not be any sort of civil war when he’s impeached by a democratic house in 2018
A man who lies about him being in the Gulf War? It’s called Stolen Valor and he should not be conformed.
Confirmed!
That's what you call"qualified?" Low bar @GOP
Bar so low it’s hitting fleas in the head as they try to duck underneath!!
Stolen Valor. 
Supports torture. 
Virulently racist. 

Just stop.

You have betrayed the #USA Sen. McConnell. 
Immigrants, LGBTQ, minorities, & most educated citizens will not forgive the @GOP for inculcating an atmosphere of hatred, inequality, & injustice.
May you face the same fate you wished upon those less fortunate.
#TrumpNOTAboveTheLaw

Feel better now?
i guess?
As for you McConnell u need to retire u are A dinosaur term limits
You are out of you mind sir. In fact your actions or lack thereof are treasonous.
Malarkey. Warmongers.
we the people are sick and tired of weak tired Repubs GO TO 51 VOTES if you don't the Dems will in a minute and will walk all over & laugh in the faces  of the Repubs #getridofmitch
Everything is qualified when your head is jammed so far up in your shell!
L'imagination est source d'erreur
Hey turtle, your time is up
You don't have much of an imagination, do you?
How do you stand up without a spine?
You’re a disgusting pathetic excuse for a human being and I can’t wait until you’re out of a job
So you’ve said........how many times????? about SoS nominees the past year and and a half?
Mitch! Do something! Save us thats your job!
I’m a turtle
Don’t vote for Pompeo..he is a bigot and shouldn’t represent our country. #PompeoIsABigot “To deny people their human rights, is to challenge their very humanity” -Nelson Mandela
You are kidding, right?
You would have said the same for Rex Tillerson; “ A fine Man”
Then get him through jackass!
Hillary Clinton? My next door neighbor?
Who the hell in their right mind would believe anything McConnell has got to say? OMG!
War monger just like Bolton!

More qualified? The guy hasn’t spent a single day in the dilplomatic corps. UR A JOKE! @realDonaldTrump is a joke! END #TheDonCon
Its actually very easy to imagine.
U must b kidding.  Pompeo is unsuited for a diplomatic post.
You must have a very limited imagination
Blow, huh? And lots of it apparently! Your shipping company. Not only are you a government thug; now you’re a drug kingpin. So tell me, when did you decide to #breakbad ?!?! Or were you always a Putz?! Asking for a friend
Ever read the autobiography, CRUSADE IN EUROPE?
  It was written by Dwight David Eisenhower!
  What did he say about the Geneva Convention?
  What did he say about prison camps?
  Was he qualified??
It’s hard to imagine you’ve been elected so many times.
Bullshit. He's a racist

He lied about his military service. 
That makes him unqualified for any position requiring top secret clearance.
Your corrupt nature overshadows your treasonous personality.  Tic toc.

Is it really hard to imagine? I mean really? 
Sure glad you think so . Please work harder on getting him confirmed .

Did you say that with a straight face? @realDonaldTrump only nominates the corrupt & unqualified. How’s that VA secretary thing going?
Its time for you to retire as well.  New age, new era, time for change is now.
