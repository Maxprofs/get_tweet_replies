Americans want paid back for 1.37 trillion dollars that G.W.Bush "borrowed" from Social Security to fund tax cuts for the rich and the Irag War. Also Trillions of dollars used to pay for pet projects that they could not get funded @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @foxandfriends
Now if you're concerned about SS I'm sure the 3 times in history there was no cost of living increase ALL 3 times under Obama and how about that 0.3 in 2016 1.7 in 2014 1.5 in 2013 1.7 in 2012

The DNC, FBI, Justice dept., Hillary Clinton, and our lovely Fake news media, should be charged with treason, obstruction of justice, contempt on the fisa court, just to name a few!
Hey Republicans, your base boos at the word "Hispanics." You know, just like Jesus would.

Don't waste your time telling republicans anything
See how the people you support feel about you, They have stolen trillions of our Social Security with no intention of ever paying it back. We do not deserve it but they enjoy a nice pension and healthcare paid for by us. @FoxNews @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump
Our Social Security is and has been being raped by republicans for years. They fill that we do not deserve it and is considered to be a welfare package for the poor "Stated by President Ronald Reagan" and similar remarks from "Paul Ryan" Trillions of dollars stolen from us
Yeah you achieved something, Now follow our Presidents work ethic and multi task, build the wall close the loopholes in our immigration laws,wean people off government, reach out to minorities ,make tax cuts permanent
Pass the kool aid, #MAGA fools.
Big deal.  Trickle down is not money it's pi_ _.
GOD BLESS YOU and your family members Mr.Hatch I'm a New Republican and I trust YOU the MOST. I wish you were not leaving, but you have given SO much. Tell people one MORE TIME THAT medical COST RUN BY GOVERNMENT is 2/3 of our budget. We can't afford that.
Sell out on everything else for a tax cut. Losers in every sense of the word.
and the first thing that MUST NOW GO is the POTUS. Three days in a row of raging, rambling, incoherent insanity.  This is not partisan. YOU MUST DO YOUR DUTY AND PROTECT OUR COUNTRY -- and the world -- FROM A MAN WHO IS OBVIOUSLY INSANE & cannot govern.

Nothing changed except the rich got richer.  So what's the big deal.  By the way #GOP support of Pruitt, if the president rips off taxpayer, so can his cabinet, right?  I see UR logic.  Which is why we #Resist.  See U soon in November.

1) we want ethics charges against Tester and blumenthal because of what happened to admiral Jackson. Jackson can't defend against these allegations cause of hippa . Do these alleged whistleblowers exist?
Blumenthal praised the courageous military men and women for coming forward ? Really they are too cowardly to put their name to allegation , lying , and didn't come forward earlier 1-12 yrs .thats dereliction of duty . Charge the dopes
Changing senate rules again? God forbid this party should win honestly!
Now all you have to do is find a way of shredding the negative thought process of anti-Trump behavior within our Congress that is hurting our country .
Yup, finally you are screwing the working man to help the wealthy and line your own pockets. At least now we know what you meant by “so much winning.”

you mean the #GOPTaxScam
Wall Street banks pocketed over $3 billion, thanks to GOP tax scam https://shareblue.com/wall-street-mega-banks-republican-tax-bill/amp/?__twitter_impression=true …

Billionaires & corporations are making out like bandits under the #GOPTaxScam. Since passage of the bill, we've seen $260 BILLION in stock buybacks, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says by…


New Government Report Confirms Trump Tax Cut Favors the Super Rich https://www.politicususa.com/2018/04/24/310588.html … via @politicususa

The EPA has shut out reporters from its announcement on making science-based regulations more transparent. The audience, visible in the live feed, is a who's who of climate deniers, all of whom have worked to weaken established climate science. https://www.epa.gov/home/live 

What will he get with that?  I know.  A bankrupt nation.
I can’t wait until your corrupt, greedy, lying party becomes extinct. Everything you have done will be undone when we elect people who actually care about the USA and its people.

Get off your butts!!
You confirmed KKKlinton in a ny minute
No shit!
Current senate efforts to allow businesses to drag heels on ADA compliance, will backfire! Publicly shaming every business dragging its heels be it papers, news web, or yelp reviews would commence! It would be hell!

#ConfirmPompeo


Deport illegals and give the savings to better technology, equipment, vehicles for our officers. Start encouraging  public areas have cameras to protect our citizen. Stop war on cops
Stop war on cops. Hate against them need to have much harsher punishments. One too many killed in the line of duty. Spend resources to protect them. More cameras in public needs to be out in the community surveiled by cops. If hospitals can surveil icu patients you can help cops
Yes an Rich people like Orrin Hatch, Darrell Issa, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell an the Wealthest of Senate/Congress benefit the most, while the working people suffer more because of this Tax Cut. Over a Trillion added to our Debt. More Debt then WW II an our kids to bear it all!
Why is @GOP so happy to give trillions to wealthy & large corporations and, stupidly, never asked for anything in return? That increased deficit and leaves less money for all the programs that help everyone else? @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr-ur donors r happy.
Orrin Hatch is a Devil Worshipper and an enemy of the Planet, a  definite threat to all life on earth. He must be put in prison and punished for his crimes.

Hey #GOPLiars! @WellsFargo is paying a BILLION $ fine for mortgage and car loan fraud. But thanks to the @GOP, WE get to pay for it, since the #GOPTaxScam netted Wells Fargo more than $6 BILLION in the last 2 quarters.
Yahhhhhh
What a mistake. Orrin should be shredded too. He’s past his prime and doesn’t understand today.  Don’t be fooled by North Korea. They’re moving to hacking. Much more sinister.

An analysis by The AP shows the nation's six big Wall Street banks saved at least $3,590,000,000 in taxes last quarter, thanks to the recently enacted Trump tax law. https://apnews.com/96589643061e4437bd45fdcc35959fe0 …

You better start acting like you care about the rule of law? Pretty soon ALL YOUR ACTIONS TILL NOW will be scrutinized.



To put this in perspective, the lowest 20% of all American workers saw an average tax cut of $15 for the first quarter.

Trump's tax plan just gave $3.6 BILLION to only 6 Wall Street companies.
That last bill shredded it all right. 
Lobbying isn’t legislating.
Who had the moment of "clarity" in the GOP side and decided to release the Comey memos, BUAHAHAHA, I just cant stop laughing. Rod Rosenstein PLAYED ALL OF YOU. He got you fools to force him to put out memos that hurt Trump worse. That was a brilliant move Rod Rosenstein.
And American people get destroyed.  #vilegop
Corporatocracy won’t cut it much longer fool! A Blue Tsunami Revolution is on its way!


McConnell is a joke!
If @realDonaldTrump  fire Muller it is going to be  a war , I head they have over 2 million  people ready to March!  So, I want his to fire Muller so I can watch the  fight, It is going to be very hard to putt this number of people in  jail- He will not win the election 2020


I HOPE THAT THIS REPUBLICAN SENATE WILL NOT VOTE FOR GRASSLEY CRAP TO PROTECT ;MUELLER " and when YOU WILL FINISH this waste of OUR MONEY and TIME ? DO NOT SIDE +DEMM. WORK ON O"care the WALL !! WE will WATCH !!
The GOP is a joke! #BlueTsunami2018
Simplification my ass.  I can't optimize a client's Section 199A deduction without graphing a three deminsional calculus model of the economic contraints.  Full blown weaponization of the tax code, not simplification.
Can't wait until the GOP is shredded in November! This is such a farce-our taxes took twice as long & cost us twice as much to do them AND we're paying more! GOP stupid stunts are a joke! BTW what abt the debt - 1.7 TRILLION = $ for corprations not for citizens! #BlueTsunami2018
Too bad you are bankrupting America and follow a criminal leader

We need to shut the GOP down, also vote them out of office NOW- NOV is the Blue Wave and it is coming after @SenateMajLdr
HE NEEDS TO RETIRE FOR GODS SAKE 
Can that shredder also shred the Deficit that was created by the Banana Republicans by giving tax cuts to the rich?
@SenateMajLdr  Of course Mitch won't bring a bill that protects Mueller & future Special Prosecutors' Investigations to the floor He is acting in his own selfish self interests. Mitch McConnell & Paul Ryan Took Millions From Russian Oligarch Tied To Putin http://washingtonjournal.com/2017/08/04/new-report-reveals-mcconnell-ryan-took-millions-russian-oligarch-tied-putin/ …
So Mitch is Trump or Putin threatening you with Blackmail? Only reason you would commit Treason refusing to bring a bill that protects special Prosecutors' Investigations to the floor for a vote.
Garbage! 3/27 All America Economic Survey found that only 1/3 of Americans have seen more money in their paychecks because of Trump tax cuts. 52 % say they’ve seen no change at all. $1.5 trillion added to the deficit-for tax cuts for the rich! A total scam as folks have realized.
