Still nothing about our slow-motion authoritarian coup? Don't be shy! We know you have an opinion.
You mean the FBI and deep state trying to rig elections and take out our elected President? Yes, it’s time to shut down the FBI entirely.
Thank you for confessing your real intentions: abolishing the FBI for doing its job. Only you got the rigging wrong—that was your illegal gerrymandering, voter-suppression, and collusion with the nation's enemies.
If your not concerned about a corrupt government, what is it that you are concerned about? Either they are corrupt or they are not, which is it? You think the FBI and such are holy saints fighting a righteous battle against Russia. Pedantic fool.
Pro tip: learn to distinguish between *your* and *you're* before calling someone a fool in public. Pedantic is OK.
Ha ha. The internet grammar police. Classic.

Et tu, Brute? Jes sayin.
Gun control, please.
No, we need the guns go after the gangs. The government will continue to do nothing. The enslavement and rape will continue until fathers, uncles, and brothers set things right. Men with guns will end this menace one way or another.
If you don't think the Swamp is Loaded w/Corrupt Leaders, including this Coke bottle looking fraud>McConnell? Then you need to read how he & his wife enriched themselves thru the Chicoms>>
Lying hypetcrit


Start closing loopholes on immigration 
 Catch and release
Opiates aren’t dangerous. Opiates are inanimate objects. It’s the people that are taking them that are dangerous. We don’t have an opiate problem. We have a people problem. - How about we treat guns with the same enthusiasm as you donfor opiates?

WILL NOBODY TELL ME WHAT THESE WEBSITES ARE!!!  It’s like you don’t trust me...#grabpussy
You should check Mueller is background (esp.when serving in Boston)more carefully Before deciding on Mueller's honesty and credibility! (See http://SaraCarter.com )
America’s underaged face many, many challenges, not just deranged, #NRA enabled bloodsuckers.
Wait did you say .... " that allows Republican Senators to avoid responsibility even as they knowingly facilitate the dismanteling of US political ethics and morals"???
#ImpeachTrumpNow
Well Mitch?
Where are your voices on Trump and Russia???????
Leader McConnell: When will you stand up for @POTUS and declare the Mueller Witch Hunt officially over? Why are you wasting our money? Why are you remaining silent?
Why are you avoiding your responsibility to protect our nation from Russia's threat to our democracy? Protect Mueller's investigation!
You continue to put party before country -
Doesn’t want to upset his pro-Trump donors. 
Next January Democrats and Independents in the Senate will vote this bagman out as majority leader. If the GOP wants to keep a majority they will replace him now with someone decent such as Senator Collins.

…
GET RID OF FILIBUSTER!!!
Change tour name to Not a leader McConnell.  Do the right thing.  Your false promise to meet and discuss the Dreamers? Did not happen, you just wanted the shutdown resolved, the posturing, now your on the rockin chair.
Retire
Are u sure tRump is going to want this?

Liar
Hey lunatic two kids were shot 65 miles away from you and you Tweet this shit
That's harsh.  Meanwhile the U.K.has confiscated Cambridge Analyticia servers today.

@scotus has ruled against internet bills prior which aimed at curbing depictions of minors engaged in sexual activity, saying cant curb adult forum of Net, and of course ISP's and Websites have immunity presently.
Be a LEADER, not the weak enabler you have been. PROTECT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. Grow some balls &USE THEM. Stop the damage Trump is doing
Why don't you focus on important stuff like a budget, immigration,etc. Now we have proof of why you do the things you do, $$! Redeem yourself and pass POTUS agenda and cabinet members. Shame on you!!
#ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller #ProtectMueller
Damn! If you close loopholes that avoid accountability, how will you be able to get another orange douche in as potus?
Due to your age, soon you won't be able to control the narrative. The History books will be absolutely brutal to you sir. Think about Governor Wallace over a bourbon tonight.
Dude, your middle name is loophole. Your nickname is panderer
How about saying something, ANYTHING, about our treasonous prez, Mitch?  Time you grew a pair.
There MUST BE SO MANY, TOO MANY LAWS ON THE BOOK TO TAKE CARE OF THIS - STOP BS WITH “need specific law.”
You didn’t close the carried interest loophole that had already made the rich richer in your tax scam. You didn’t feel that they got enough  so you had to give them more. Talk about a totally corrupt party. Blue wave is coming.
I take it you either haven’t heard about the school shooting in Maryland or you just don’t care....I’m putting my bet on the latter one.  You’re a POS!!!
they don’t care it doesn’t fit their communist agenda!

We now have 272 pending Senate confirmation hearings.

We are 14 months into the @realDonaldTrump presid…
Care to comment?

Come clean or face the consequences from Mueller, the voters, or both. Does Trump/Russia/CA have dirt on you?  We will find out.
POTUS open war with FBI. Your silence is treason
Country over party
#BlueWaveComing2018 #Resist
Another school shooting today.
If we are going to blame drug dealers for supplying people with drugs then shouldn’t we blame gun manufactures for supplying guns?
you are theBIGGEST A$$ ... getting rid of loopholes in sex trafficking... BUT KEEP LOOPHOLES ON GUNS  SALING GUN TO UNDER 21 FOR THAT MATTER ANYONE NEVER RE-ELECTION NRA PUPPET
Too bad most of the people this bill is ostensibly intended to protect are against it.
Fantastic....now how about a bill to secure Mueller's appointment? Wouldn't want anyone to avoid responsibility would you?
Theresa Hong is getting a free pass.why?
MUST WATCH - This needs to go VIRAL
Propaganda War: FB, Twitter, Russia, the GOP & Trump. Watch & Read the Thread.
What law will protect the Mueller investigation? Oh, that's right, congress can't upset trump or they might get vomited on, huh? We're all at the mercy of a russian stooge
About that @SenateGOP @HouseGOP  GOP tax scam and trickle down...  yet another one bites the dust.
Jesus, this may implicate comrade trumpsky.
Why not close the loopholes in the tax code and gun laws?
GUNS. YOU FORGOT THE GUN PROBLEM.
#GunControlNow #ImpeachTrump
No Spine, Resign

You avoid responsibility. Resign.
