#ProtectMueller #ProtectRosenstein
WHY ARE YOU BLOCKING PROTECTION OF MUELLER AND THE INVESTIGATION????
Get them all CONFIRMED NOW! It should not take 10 years to get Trump's nominees confirmed. Do your JOB McConnell! 
@realDonaldTrump 
@SteveScalise
@TedCruz

There is no indication that Trump will fire Mueller except:

1. That time he ordered the White House counsel to fire Mueller…

Why don't you damned @GOP address what is really important for America other than lining the courts with conservative lemmings? Protect Mueller. Look at the facts and stop sticking your head up your butts and impeach the labreaker im the WH. DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION FOR ONCE.
MERRICK GARLAND.

You’re a #TRAITOR Mitch
Hypetcrit shame resign
Another corporate lawyer appointed to the @NLRB. Trump has appointed 4 management lawyers and one rookie, not a single labor lawyer

This @POTUS and @SenateGOP continue to demonstrate their contempt for working Americans with their legitimate needs for opportunity and empowerment
Stacking the deck.. eh Uncle Mitchy?  What ever will they do once you and your pal, Pauline Screw are gone?
Back our choice of @POTUS-fight harder!  protect our vote! do what is right by us, the American people #MAGA #KAG2020 
Good!
Keep them coming..
@SenateMajLdr don't you think it's high time we stop this ludicrous Mueller investigation. He has stepped over the line and raided a personal attorney's office, home, and hotel room, because he still has found nothing. We are sick and tired of the corruption.
I wonder what we would find IF WE RAIDED McConnell and his wife's homes and office?  McConnell needs to support Trump 100% and QUIT STABBING HIM IN THE BACK along with 65 million Americans who voted for him.
WANT TO KNOW WHY CONFIRMATIONS ARE SLOW???? DID YOU SEE THIS??? And yes, I am yelling so you will hear me.
WATCH: During her confirmation hearing this morning (yes, this morning – in 2018), judicial nominee Wendy Vitter refused to say whether she agreed with the result in Brown v. Board of Education. #UnfitToJudge 
Big deal you creep. Do the urgent and immediate thing and pass the Mueller protection bill. #GOPTraitors
"Following the confirmation of Ms. Boom to the District Court yesterday, the #Senate has moved" - @SenateMajLdr. Congratulations; You must have started cracking your Senate appointed Whip. Unprecedented filibusters require some pushback or price. Negotiate
Following the confirmation of Ms. Boom to the District Court yesterday, the #Senate has moved to the nomination of John Ring to serve on the @NLRB. After his confirmation today, the Senate will vote on nominees to the @USDOL, the @EPA, and two more District Court vacancies.
Protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
For the good of the country, please allow a vote on the bill to protect the Mueller Investigation.
So you can use the courts as a political weapon. Which is what you do. Do the country a favor and retire.
Bring the Protect Mueller vote  to the floor.
Thanks oracle Mitch.
Kentucky wants to kiss your A$$ goodbye
Merrick Garland
Great but about time and SUPPORT YOUR FREAKING POTUS!!!! MUELLERHEAD IS A WITCH HUNT OF EPIC PROPORTIONS GO GET OUT THERE AND VOICE YOUR OPPOSITION BEFORE WE ARE !))% BANANA REPUBLIC
You get paid a full salary for this?
ALLOW THE VOTE TO #ProtectMueller!!! What are you hiding ?!?!?! Call this SOB’s office and DEMAND he allow a vote. What is turtle man McConnell hiding  (202) 224-2541
By any standard you have done a CRAPPY JOB for your  constituents. You're rich and so very many of them live in poverty with no clean water. LIAR LIAR LIAR
Ugh! GOP most corrupt party ever
Filling the swamp to defeat the American people!
Your leadership is embarrassing....

SENATOR MCCONNELL, LET IT BE KNOWN AMONGST ANYBODY WHO STILL LIKES YOU that YOU are blocking a vote to protect Mueller, you Russian enabling, Justice obstructing, economy killing, drug smuggling CORRUPT politician.
It is extremely important to pass a bill to prevent Mueller from being fired without good cause.  This is important for our country.  Trump has a tendency to go off without just cause.  This is unacceptable.
Majority Leader, will these nominees be of a more righteous, Conservative nature or will they be additional UNWANTED RINOS??  DRAIN THE SWAMP MAGA
When's this bozo leaving
Enjoy because were coming.
Step down u TRUMP HATER and America traitor! YOU'VE MADE ENOUGH MONEY, NOW LEAVE
Good
Move everyone one of his appointees though with lighting speed because you are still behind allowing the Dems to have control and slow walk it all. PAST TIME FOR ACTION!
You really have no redeeming value Mitch.
Remember that time you stole a Supreme Court seat? It’s going in the history books right next to Donald Trump’s Russian-aided electoral victory. Ah 2016, what a year for democracy
Gee, you guys suddenly seem busy with confirmation hearings.  Why is that?
Does it hurt to have such a tiny, shriveled soul? Can you actually feel the gaping hole where most of us keep our character?
Please STOP! You have an illegitimate president in the @WhiteHouse and you know it. Anything you are doing is a fraud! #GOPIsComplicit
Uh, I don’t care. I’m STILL waiting on what YOU promised, repeal Obamacare and healthcare reform. WHAT, you thought we forgot? Not a chance, old man. #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp #MAGA
Doing a great job Mitch. Keep those judges coming!
Please exchange the word Leader, from in front of your name, and replace it with Loser.
Rush these through before you lose your slim majority.
SICK IT, MITCH! Why don't you retire!
Suck haha
We expect these appointments to be confirmed before November.
How about our Germany Ambassador??!!
Congratulations on doing less than the bare minimum of you job description.... weak
I hope you're forever remembered for your disgusting partisanship and failure to hold hearings and a vote on qualified nominees just because the president of another party nominated those persons.
mutt mcconnell for guillotine please
Run the table on the courts. Break up the 9th !
#ProtectMuellerNow Join an event to say Trump Is Not Above the Law!
Call a vote on the bi-partisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel. Your inaction speaks volumes.
Confirm @RichardGrenell. Yesterday!
#PROTECTMUELLER you fucking prick.
Still whistling past the graveyard I see. I wonder how much money your minions made when they sold their souls just to be on your "staff". What a pathetic embarrassment for them.
About time.
Your job is to push for the impeachment of the president.
move faster...ppls confidence, trust, faith in country’s justice system is disappearing. Dems & holdovers use delay/time to obstruct & confound the law! Ur procedures don’t work w/ hateful obstructionists in the opposition! Go nuclear 4 heaven sake! Like a parliamentary system!
When did electing judges become more important thank saving your country from the lying, cheating, stealing, corrupt POTUS?
what about the investigation into Russian interference into our election? how about protecting that?
Time to get some work done!!
 Keep 'em coming!
Complicit fool!
You should stick to congratulating yourself for the stolen SCOTUS seat.
#ProtectMueller you ass hat
Here's a thought, Mitch. Why not vote to protect Mueller's job and do something GOOD for the country for once.
We can't normalize you or your party. 
We'll flush you in the midterms.
"Following more confirmations and nominations - I just want to guarantee you MAGAs that we are doing everything we can to destroy this country" McConnell translation
Hurry up. We need real judges in place not political judges who are taking orders from Obama and the deep state.
GREAT LETS SEE HOW MUCH MORE YOU CAN FUCK AMERICA OVER.
Time to keep the Senate in session 24/7  and change the rules to eliminate the 30 hour rule! Get the job done!
U better step it up or u will be gone next Ryan left as he knows we are sick of u rinos! U either help us & @realDonaldTrump Fix USA or be voted out!
Confirm @RichardGrenell
For once, focus on Trump....  wth is wrong with you... you're NO leader!

Mitch as has been the @GOP & Trump agenda. We will rise, we will remove your hacks & keep those worthy. For first time lifetime appt. undone
Bragging about your implementation of regulatory capture. It isn't something to be proud of you toad.
القنون الاساس الحكمه في الاداره
Mitch, you are the man, making inconsequential stuff happen left and right.  You will be remembered in history books and the halls of Congress through the centuries.
Are you retiring?
Tweeting an awful lot today, Turtle. Tweet every minute. It won’t distract us from the fact that you are a useless, do nothing, cowardly traitor. You will be remembered as such. #NotALeader #GOPtraitors
Support our President!

This is McConnell’s only vision: Roping the courts with strident conservatives while letting his constituents hang.
But...but Gorsuch!
Nothing but more #Swampy GOP! Vote these slime balls out!

Of course Mitch. You and Trump want to Stack judge positions as of the Hammers coming down. I find it interesting that the chairman of Finance for the RNC just got raided.#DitchMitch #followthemoney #BlueWave #bluetasumi #Bluewave2018 #neverevertrustarepublican #votethemout
When will you be holding a hearing for #MerrickGarland?
When does the Trumpsky impeachment trial start?
You sir are a Russian puppet .. 

How many millions have you received from Russia ? 

Mueller knows ., 
Him sell country  to Russia  today  what  next
Why TF are you still talking, soulless, traitor, turtle-man?
Confirm the ambassadors fool
Hmm, filling the court with more swamp dwellers? Your time's coming, Mitch.
RETIRE ALREADY. THE US AND KENTUCKY DESERVE BETTER.
Good heavens, yes, this! You better go while the going is good.
You're as corrupt and cowardly as they come @SenateMajLdr. History will show that. It's your legacy
STFU you POS get fked


Many people are saying that you are a ruthless scumbag that has motives and we will remember you as a premeditated, corrupt politician who never had a shred of decency or integrity. BAD!

Why don’t you focus on legislation to keep tRump from firing Mueller? #CountryOverParty
Protect Mueller, or move aside and let those who care about our country lead!
Hey Mitch, quick question. Heard your friend @SpeakerRyan was retiring so was wondering if you were thinking the same? Just curious thx hmu
Do Your Job!!
Don't forget to include Merrick Garland on your list.
Where is the vote for saving Muller? Your senators already introduced it today, what about you?
About time.
No one nominated by this administration should be confirmed Mitch.
Ring has no business in the @NLRB !!

He hates workers and workers rights
One, two.
Mueller’s comin’ for you 
adding more idiots to the parade..
Tick Tock.  

Better expedite the crap out of that junk.
Reminder that the legislative branch is an equal to the executive. It's time for you to stop acting like a subjugated pawn and stand up to @realDonaldTrump and the mockery he's making of his office.
