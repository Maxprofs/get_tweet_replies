It's completely absurd to assert that we should do something a certain way because it's been tradition. TRADITIONALLY, Presidents have put up mostly qualified nominees. There's zero reason to keep up tradition when Trump keeps nominating corrupt & unqualified individuals.
Go ahead and lecture us about norms. I'll just be sitting here reading more about Republicans trying to discredit the former FBI director who got fired because he wouldn't help Trump discredit Russian meddling accusations.
Shadowing Comey: @CNN has learned the Republican campaign to discredit the former FBI director is now turning to lions, including this fury costumed creature who will be tailing Comey on his upcoming book…
TRADITIONALLY, the NASA director has been a non-political appointee with a a background in science or military or both. Also, traditionally misusing charity money to benefit yourself would be a disqualifier. You are breaking all norms here.
Ah yes, you are surely a principled follower of tradition and norms when it comes to nominations... #MerrickGarland ring any bells? Quit whining, #hypochrite
They don’t think they’re smarter than the rest of us. They know they are richer than the rest of us.
yeah, until you said that you would do everything in your power to NEVER support our 44th President.

#VoteBlue2018
Thank you for sharing that. Mitch has turned into a complete ass. Garland was my redline re:Mitch and he never responded to my complaint with even a form letter. Arrogance. Can’t wait for him to go. And I am @GOP.
The absolute divisiveness in this country can be traced back to McConnell & his Garland decision. Always will be arguments, but he took it to a new level. Congress will be a better place when he leaves.
Well you helped killed that with 2 words, Merrick Garland. Congrats on killing comity.
#stolenseat
There used to also be a long-standing tradition of putting BILLS ON THE FLOOR to be voted on BY OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS! But now you think you’re our supreme leader and only you decide our fate. #Time4MitchToGo
You've killed off a lot of long traditions in the Senate, Sen McConnell. Too late to start complaining about it now.
Merrick Garland. 

Now kindly go eff your turtley self.
What’s the name of the Russian oligarch who donated 3 million dollars to Mitch’s SuperPAC?
McConnell received $2.5 million for his GOP Senate Leadership Fund from Ukrainian-born billionaire Leonard Blavatnik (under the names of two of Blavatnik's holding companies, Access Industries and AI Altep Holdings).
Sir. With all due respect. Although you deserve none...You’re batshit crazy and apparently completely senile. Do you think we  don’t remember all the crap you did to Obama ???
Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland. Merrick...
I remember when Senate voted on Supreme Court nominees too.
Two words for that:

#MerrickGarland
Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick Garland Merrick
Oh ok, so that makes Republican obstruction ok. Because the stakes were higher for them. Got it. Republicans are little bitches who can't handle reality so they bend the rules just enough...
And you're right the two things are unrelated. What Mitch McConnell did was way worse and way more divisive.
Like the longstanding tradition of up or down votes on Supreme Court nominees that you killed in 2016.
There was also a long-standing tradition of meeting SCOTUS nominees.
What about the bipartisan support for protection for Mueller?
How can u claim to support bi partisanship when the @POTUS treats Democrats worse than the murderous dictator that used chemical weapons against women & children?-He constantly reaches out to work WITH PUTIN not Dems
You have a conflict of interest with protecting Mueller by being paid by Russians. Step aside and let Congress vote to protect Mueller or just resign. #ProtectMueller
There was a long standing and overwhelmingly bipartisan tradition of electing and appointing leaders who weren’t complete and total crooks, but that all ended in 2016.  

#BlueWaveComing2018 
#2018Midterms
I came to simply say “Merrick Garland” but I see many, many, MANY others beat me to it. That makes my heart happy, so instead of a simple “Merrick Garland” I’ve decide to go with a giant #YouSuckAtThis instead

Merrick Garland u traitors
Lets ask Judge Garland about long standing traditions .
There were once several longstanding and overwhelmingly bipartisan traditions in the Senate. You blew up many of them. Oh, and Merrick Garland says " 'Sup?" #StolenSeat
You destroyed comity by refusing to allow a committee hearing, let alone a committee vote or a full Senate vote on Merrick Garland.

You are solely responsible for tilting the court for a generation thanks to unbridled hate of @barackobama.
No doubt the GOP is cheering on your disruption and sabotage of the function of the Senate to benefit the GOP.

And you’re still doing it with mucking around with the schedule to try and hamstring Senate Democrats running for reelection.
You’ve put party before nation and have saddled us with a corrupt and compromised Trump administration.

More than that, the GOP has rubber stamped clearly unqualified, incompetent, or compromised nominees solely because they have a (R) after their name.
There used to be an understanding that Supreme Court nominees get a hearing too but you decided a sitting president shouldn’t be able to nominate
He had his choice for Secretary of State confirmed. Then he fired him via tweet.
Are you kidding me is the perfect headline here. 
Mitch McConnell has destroyed more long-standing bipartisan traditions in the #Senate than any other American in history.
He broke the Constitution in doing so. #MerrickGarland is merely one example.
FOAD Mitch.
Everyone hates you, man. And it's well-deserved.
History is not going to be kind to you, Mitch.
I'm tired of waiting on history to be unkind...let's be unkind NOW, when it could make a difference!
We seem to have our hands tied. Mitch is drunk with power and DGAF.
There was a long time standing tradition of not supporting criminals and covering for them. #GOPCorruption
You don't get to talk about long standimg anything. Merick Garland.
Your so right! McConnell is a hypocrite that cherry-picks the senate rules and traditions that benefit him in the moment and ignores the rest.
Do not embarrass yourself further.

There is a bipartisan bill to protect Robert Meuller why are you refusing to take it to the floor ??
That was during a time when the country, House and Senate, had competent leadership. Sadly, with @POTUS , yourself, and @SpeakerRyan at the helm,  those days are memories.
You only like the norms when you get what you want. Everyone else gets blown out of the water.
Merrick Garland? Remember him?
We do and we won't forget.
That's because he is blatantly unqualified! On a related note, wtf was that @NASA confirmation all about!? I didn't think anyone worse than @BetsyDeVosED could be confirmed but the bar was lowered even further. You should be ashamed.

You’re an embarrassment to the Senate and a joke as Majority Leader.  That role needs someone not suffering from ideological myopia and misplaced loyalties.  Your job is to be part of checks and balances, not to be a lackey that enables an inept and dangerous Executive Branch.
Apparently, integrity means nothing to you.
We are not supporting dirty #POMPEO PUPPET of both Koch & RUSSIA! We will see you in Hel$
SHAME on you sir! There’s also been A more hallowed tradition of over 200 years of bipartisan voting on #SCOTUS nominees. You embarrass America, please #resign. #TrumpRussiaCollusion
And if you haven't noticed we've given up on a lot of American tradition over the last couple of years.


Except when the nominee DOES NOT BELIEVE IN DIPLOMACY!!! Just like the EPA nominee DID NOT BELIEVE IN PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT! Or the ED Sec nominee BELIEVING in PUBLIC EDUCATION!!! Cut the bullshit propaganda!
Please "RESIGN" before the #Bluewave does indeed take your seat.
Some Dems will vote for Pompeo and he will Be Confirmed ; No Worries 
Are u in the military? If not, u need to volunteer tomorrow bc Pompeo is going to start a war & ppl like u need to be the cannon fodder.

You sorta messed up that tradition. McConnell’s legacy will the man who destroyed the US Senate.
how bout you just go play a quick game of hide and go fck yourself
Or Hide and Go Quit.
There was a long standing tradition of nominating good people, honest people, you destroyed that.
There was a long-standing tradition of senators representing the people and not the president. You are such a little f****** weasel. I cannot wait to see you booted out of the office you are a shitstain on America.
“Are you kidding me!” - You are the worst offender when it comes to blowing up norms of behaviour in the Congress.  Judge Garland’s ghost will continue to haunt the GOP #BlueWaveComing2018
What up with not protecting Mueller?
Blind support of a war-mongering torture-supporter is putting party over country again.

Hey, there also was a tradition of letting the Senate consider a presidential nomination for the supreme court, but you threw that in the dirt. 

Wasn't there also a tradition of protecting the US from attack? How about supporting the FBI and special council? 

You're useless
Really it is appalling that anyone in the United States would refer to human beings like this ... #TrumpResignNow
Well when you bring traitors to be nominated this is what happens! You are all crooks and everyone sees right through it.
I don't think a president in his final year should make these appointments.
Hey Comrade.
Whats up with not one of you defending @nikkihaley 
She is the only one in the administration that seems like a patriot
We haven't always had such a corrupt president.
Damn right!
Yeah there was also one about allowing presidents to nominate Supreme Court justices—until the president was black you foul racist hypocrite and constitution rapist.
I didn't forget because it didn't happen. Nice try with the fake facts though.
I'm ignorant of plenty of things, and eager to learn. You wrote that the Democrats did the same thing to Republicans in a president's last year. If that is true, please educate me. Who was the Republican nominee who, like Merrick Garland, did not get hearings in which D. Senate?
Frankly, Senator, you forfeited the right to lament the loss of "long-standing and overwhelmingly bipartisan tradition in the #Senate" when you denied #MerrickGarland a hearing for #SCOTUSnom. Your words and soul are hollow.
#MerrickGarland  #stolenseat Are you kidding me?

Not when they are inexperienced and unfit for the role. Oh, and remember Merrick Garland?
Long standing tradition of voting on supreme Court judges when they are nominated by the President of this USA. But you broke that one didn't you. KMA
Merrick. Garland.
Mike Pompeo also:

Denies that climate change is caused by human beings.

Stands against marriage equality.

Attacks women’s essential reproductive rights.  

Pushes for reckless military intervention.
There also was a longstanding Senate tradition of doing its job by voting yes or no on a president’s Supreme Court appointments, and not sandbagging and refusing to do your job for close to a year with a ridiculous reference to the “Biden rule.” Hypocrite.
#TrumpCult
Yeah well there used to be a lot of long-standing traditions which you’ve abandoned. Don’t try to put this on anyone but yourself.
You are a disgrace to the traditions of our government.

There was a long-standing and overwhelmingly bipartisan tradition in the #Senate of support of Secretaries of @StateDept. https://bit.ly/2Hw6C74 
There was also a longstanding and overwhelmingly bipartisan tradition in the Senate of bringing Presidential nominations to the SCOTUS ( Merrick Garland) and bills wanted by constituents ( protect Mueller) to a vote, & yet here we are...
There was a long standing and overwhelmingly bipartisan tradition in the #senate of support for this country, the rule of law, and for the Senate Leader not selling his wife into sexual slavery to the POTUS, too.
Merrick Fucking Garland, you shitcan.
Least credible person to complain about bipartisan and long-standing traditions of the senate.
Huh! Imagine that! There was ALSO a long standing bipartisan tradition in the #Senate of support of sitting Presidents nominations to the SCOTUS. Merrick Garland ring a bell “Turtle Gizzard”??
Yes and allowing candidates for the Supreme Court to be voted on? I Think you've been stepping on quite a few historic precedents.
We also have a long standing Tradition of having Administrations who work in the interest of America, not the Kremlin. We also have a long standing Tradition of MoC's who are Americans, and act as such - not Traitors!
MERRICK. GARLAND.

You sob!
MERRICK GARLAND! 
Dude. Resign.
BS. There was a long standing tradition of allowing sitting Presidents to make appointments to the Supreme Court too. You're corrupt to the bone.
Merrick Garland.
Merrick Garland.
Merrick Garland, buddy
Don’t talk about bipartisanship, you political hack. Your corrosive behavior during the last administration has set the stage for disfunction.
Merrick Garland
I think you misspelled vote on Supreme Court nominees
You who took a Supreme Court nominee from Obama. You have no shame sir
Future historians are going to drag your name through rusted barbed wire and toss it into a ditch only to be brought up to be mocked  #getbent
Merrick Garland...

and for you Mitch the turtle,
You're supporting the wrong guy. We don't want another war. Why do Republicans always start a war?  The first Bush and the second Bush namely.
From @TopherSpiro: 

"Also long-standing Senate traditions:
-Regular order
-Hearings for major legislation 
-Hearing and vote for a Supreme Court nominee
-Independence and oversight "

Seems like "traditions" are applicable only when they are convenient.  McConnell is a #fraud.
Oh, *now* he believes in longstanding bipartisan solutions....
You vote yes if candidate is good you vote no if not. Current nominee is not good.
Yea Mitch what the fuck happened to that...oh yeah.....you. sanctimonious SOB.
There was a long standing emphasis on the rule of law and checks and balances between branches of government, but that’s gone as well.
Don't  yammer to us about "tradition" ... you broke tradition when you withheld a vote so the GOP could steal a SCOTUS seat ... you broke tradition when you threw your support to a draft dodging pu$$y grabbing porn star loving cheat.
You're on the wrong side of history
.
and God.
F.
U.
McConnell
Traditions replaced by Obstructions.
McConnell: I won't put legislation to protect Mueller on Senate floor Turtle Seems to Forget He WORKS For Us TAXPAYERS And i Wanna Know How Mitch Knows What Trump will Do It Should be VOTED On if Trump Doesn't SIGN We Already know he's GUILTY Like you
Go Yourself 
The only thing long-standing Is you, against the constitution!
Does anyone have any guesses as to how many moons and suns exist in the make believe world that McConnell lives in?
PS - Many of us, including members of the esteemed Senate, have concerns about Pompeo's background/qualifications. Don't act like #45 is in the habit of nominating QUALIFIED individuals for important posts.
Oh cry me a river turtle man! I guess it’s tradition to hold open a scotus seat for a year? Pathetic complicit spineless hack! Boo fuqing hoo
  

Ha that’s Mitch, a little camera shy lol 
You called the destruction of democratic norms your proudest accomplishment in office. Now you can deal with the consequences.

Mitch McConnell's super PAC took $1 million in 2017 from Russian born billionaire who made a large portion of his money under Putin in Russia. He's taken $2.5 million in total from the same Russian. #DitchMitch …

Similar to the tradition of voting on Supreme Court nominees?
#MerrickGarland
There was a long standing and overwhelmingly  bipartisan  tradition in #senate of opposing #torture . Too bad thats gone .
Two Words: Merrick Garland.
When will you allow the issue of gun safety to be discussed in the Senate? When will you allow protecting Mueller to be discussed? You have zero credibility.
No, Leader McConnell, are you f*****g kidding me? #MerrickGarland
Too bad nothing you say means anything in the real world!
There was also a long-standing bipartisan tradition of prompt and fair consideration of Supreme Court nominees once, too.
Merrick Garland.
Merrick Garland called and said to have a nice day.
you shat on that tradition when you decided on day one of 44s presidency to stonewall him. remember Cassandra Butts? or merrick garland? u r truly loathsome&history will only look less&less fondly on your transparent contempt for this country's people&norms
You disgraced Senate norms when you refused to give Merrick Garland a hearing so save your sanctimonious rhetoric for the poorly educated.
You have obliterated many longstanding traditions. You decided to trample over badic procedures so don’t call foul now.

You and the @SenateGOP killed bipartisanship in the #Senate over the last 8 years...yet you have the balls to make a claim like that.
what about protecting Muller? oh wait you are part of the collusion #LockThemAllUp #ImpeachTrumpNow #TreasonousTrump
What about a vote for protection of Mueller that you singlehandedly are blocking even with bipartisan support in the senate from reaching the floor? How’s that for bipartisanship?

You refuse to protect your country. You're a traitor to America and our values.
Hey that judgeship you stole!!!
Since when do YOU care about tradition??? Oh, only when it affects you.
Any long-standing, overwhelming bipartisan tradition was completely destroyed by YOU! YOU broke the senate. Look in the mf’ing mirror ffs.
@SenateGOP
@SenateMajLdr is a Never-Trump Rino.
If it benefits our #POTUS in any way we can count on #LdrMcConnell to bury it refusing to bring it to the floor. We understand you have 500 bills buried already.

"Leader" McConnell ... LMAO
Like McCain he's willing to sacrifice GOP
Yeah.  There was a long standing bipartisan tradition to interview the nominee for Supreme Court by a sitting president.  Then you poisoned that long standing tradition.  You, sir, are a traitor to this great nation.
Let's talk about stolen Supreme Court seats @SenateMajLdr and Russian money
#GOPComplicit #DoYourJob #ObstructionOfJustice


Exactly! Booker and those voting no based on religious reasons are going against the constitution impeachable offense. They are holding up progress of the country. They may not be up for elections till 2020 but it wont be forgotten. Internet is forever.

You're refusing to do your job.  You're not a politician, you're a traitor and a criminal.  History will remember your betrayal.  Starting with your next election.
One difference. In the past, nominees have been, as a rule, qualified for the job. Of course, this nomination throws it all out the window, so all bets are off, and no bipartisan support is owed.
Mitch kindly remove Trump’s D from your mouth and Vlad’s D from your backside and try to start acting like the American Senator you allegedly are.
Apparently as you look at campaign contributions, we are short on American Congress folks.
Spare us, Mitch. Tradition only matters when it suits you. Your actions are solely motivated by self-interest, not the people's interests, so your wishes should be blockaded at every turn.
Secretary of State-in-waiting Mike Pompeo never served in the Gulf War,  even though media outlets and many of his colleagues have repeatedly  said he did.
Why can’t the Senate get together and get rid of Mitch and his wife who are getting paid on our tax dollars? They don’t care about America they themselves are millionaires so why should they, we need somebody on the Senate that will work for the people Ditch Mitch.
Merrick Garland.
When it suits you. You politicians as a group appear to have very short and also convenient memories.
what about SCOTUS pick traditions?
Two words for you regarding "tradition in the senate," Senator McConnell: MERRICK GARLAND.
Republicans used to be the "Law & Order" party, patriots who believed in keeping America safe from foreign enemies. Things change. Not for the better, huh?
Used to be a tradition on SCOTUS justices. You broke things.
Merrick Garland

Your gone Mid Term Elections Mitch!
Your crassness is unbelievable. Merrick Garland, remember him? Clearly other people do. You destroyed the so called “ regular order”. Now you are ripping the rewards.
Two words: MERRICK GARLAND. Reap what you sow, wankpuffin.
Can you not have the legacy of being the most worthless Maj. Ldr. In History to a sitting @POTUS for absolutely no support but obstructing with the Democrats.
I can't wait until you are gone. You're are the most damaging politician in the last 20 years. You personally set this country back and permanently damaged our democracy.
How do you sleep at night, Turtleman?

You have sold out the country to Russia, 1%ers and corporate lobbyists.
You will go down in the books as one of America's biggest traitors.
After Trump and Pence and Nunes and Flynn and Page and Manafort and Papadop and R9hrbacher...
You can’t seriously be tweeting about longstanding Senate tradition. I mean, come on. You and @SenateGOP @GOP have completely destroyed Senate tradition.
Merrick Garland. You hypocrite!!!!!!!!!!!!

You have harmed the GOP and the Republic more than Trump. And he’s a F’ng idiot. Go. To. Hell. Evil, power mad little man. You are the worst of America.
There was a long-standing and overwhelmingly bipartisan tradition in the #Senate of support of Supeme Court nominees which you broke. Merrick Garland. You dish it out but can’t take it without whining?

Two words, sir: Merrick Garland.
This is rich coming from you ... you threw tradition out with the bath water and you can’t get it back.  Many in this country have a functional memory!
You also had a long standing tradition of real oversight when needed. @SenateMajorityL #complicit?
Sorry but you refer to a history when presidents respected the rule of law & tradition & had respect for all Americans. Now what we have is a disastrous presidency that you are enabling. Pompeo's close relationship with 45* is a minus not a plus. This man is a bad choice.
Are you fucking kidding me?

That sir, is dissembling. You are deliberately failing to mention those the GOP kept from being nomnated due to threatening a filibuster/no cloture vote. 
Specific example - @AmbassadorRice who was kept from being nominated for SoS due to GOP opposition.
Never have we had such an overwhelming number of criminals and under qualified nominees for positions in the history the US. Get over yourself. #BlueWave
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahabahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahababahahahahaahahahahahahahahahabahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
That’s a joke isn’t it
Oh, you long-standing and overwhelmingly bipartisan traditions like regular-order? Or actually voting on SCOTUS nominees, no matter who is Prez? You’re an embarrassment, Yertyl.
Hey remember when you wouldn’t hold a vote for President Obama’s choice for SCOTUS? Good times! Payback is a bitch, isn’t it?
Mitch: Merrick Garland.
