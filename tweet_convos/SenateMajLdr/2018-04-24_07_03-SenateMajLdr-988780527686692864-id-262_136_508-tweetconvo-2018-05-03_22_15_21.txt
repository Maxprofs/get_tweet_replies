Barely. Because @RandPaul caved, again, as usual. Kentucky senators are a clear and present danger to our country. Looking forward to voting you out in 2020. #BlueWave
Paul is a primadonna. He does these things for the press. What an empty suit....
There are 41,000 Zip Codes in America. Only one President hasn’t released his tax returns. Let’s get to work, sign a national petition requiring president candidates tax returns for pass ten years! http://amp.miamiherald.com/news/local/in- … @LeChatNoire4
He’s under audit again though.
Who cares if he’s under audit! Rick Scott says in his recent term limit add “they work for us!” So how can we make the national Tax Return petition happen? Let’s get to work! We can’t count on @DNC @NancyPelosi @SenBillNelson @SenSchumer to make this happen
You’re preaching to the choir, we’d all or most sane Americans would like to see Trumps tax returns in whatever way possible. But if this works with congress let’s make it happen.
The Choir needs to raise its voices! Why not use trumps own tool to have us all Sing in Harmony! Start a Twitter petition? Can @MoveOn assist? @LeChatNoire4
@MichaelAvenatti Mr. Avenatti, Can you help by filing a law suite in NYC or CA for trumps tax returns?
Gearing up for a good ol bombing
Another highly suspect candidate u are promoting irregardless of concerns
trump’s got Putin on speed dial.
Richard Grennell.   What’s going on @SenateMajLdr ?  Get to WORK on confirmations
Resign.
Big mistake.
We don’t need a bigot and a war hawk as Secretary of State.
What makes you say that?
Another unqualified, unvetted appointee who will resign before he’s done any good.
yeeeaaahhh that means trump ain't changing anything. #ultimatefalseflag #trumpisultimatefalseflag #americawasconquered100yearsago #themerger #globalizationundertrump
Nuke war for everyone, right? Nuke wars are survivable, right? Who cares if the world will be closer to incineration? Not you or Pompeo. It’s utterly immoral to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with our allies. No on Pompeo!
When's our ambassador to germany getting confirmed.what a disgrace all of u r
Thanks, oracle Mitch.
Thank you
If the Obama campaign had as many guilty pleas and indictments as Trump’s you would have shut the Senate down and refused votes on any of his nominees. You are a hypocrite and a partisan and an amoral coward. And history will remember.
So will his voters.
30 hrs is to long president trump need his people.  You are in charged he need his nominees.  You need to make it happen it is on you
A short list of potential candidates for the SOS position more qualified/appropiate than Mr. Pompeo:
 • My neighbors Pug, Winston
 • Any of the baristas at my local coffee shop. (Except you, Jeffery. You know why.)
 • Jesse Ventura
 • Larry Flint
 • Mel Gibson
Why try to obstruct the vote to protect Mueller @SenateMajLdr    PARTY OVER COUNTRY??
Make America Hate Again
And @realDonaldTrump will fire him the following week
More lies from the RCE Republican Criminal Enterprise of the United States! Get the f out!
How about staying in session 7 days a week and get all of this appointments confirmed . After all you are the Senate Leader with the Majority. This is ridiculous what's happening to your President in your Senate sir.
Forced another Cabinet member through even though he appears to harbor dangerous views about Muslims and LGBT. Congrats!
The wave is coming in November.
Lol.   No it’s not.
And another Dictator Trump failure

I'm still waiting for any explanation of why so many in the Trump campaign were meeting Russians. Why? "It's not illegal" doesn't put me at ease as a plausible explanation. https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/990168776808255488 …

When can we vote you out of the leadership!!? #ditchmitch #fireMcConnell #Senate
Terrible choice but mcconnell chose trump too for president which also was a colossal mistake
You need to Cancel all weekends and work until ALL nominees are confirmed.   GET TO WORK
You guys are so disgusting! Embarrassing
That is all well a fine ! let's step the Hell up with confirmation's

When is the vote on #MerrickGarland ?
Great. He picks the best people. That is why your having to confirm his cabinet 2 and 3 times. Quit blaming others for Spanky's inability to pick qualified Secretaries and judges
Excellent Work Hon. Sen. Dad Mitch McConnell.  Your Children Love You, and can't think of Life without You!  ALMIGHTY GOD BLESS You, Forever and ever.
A vote for a candidate that follows party line is not inspiring, especially when Paul had to be pressured into changing his vote.
Pompeo is a black hat, like you McConnell.

His own agency contradicts him about Russian interference in the 2016 election.
#TrumpRussia!
WHY, he wasn't that great in House or CIA?

Get Congress to work 7 DAYS a week until ALL President Trumps nominees have confirmed. Come on!  America works ALL the time, so can y'all!
That's because none of you spineless @GOP have the guts to stand up to 45 and actually serve the country and not just the corrupt party and its rich donors. The scum of American politics - Republicans
NOOOOOO. http://NO.NO.NO.NO.NO.NO.NO.NO . APPARENTLY you are all hard of hearing despite better insurance than most of America. 
@POTUS
Listen or Resign.

#IMPEACHTHERUMP
What @SenateMajLdr has done / continues to do should be criminal. Holding the Senate hostage to push personal agendas... perhaps it will be one day - and retroactive. Gorsuch sits in a stolen seat. #MerrickGarland
@GOP voting for this imbecile is highly disturbing!
Republicans biggest problem is Mconnel. He really needs to be replaced.
Now do ambassador to Germany!
#ICYMI MItch McConnell will not protect Mueller or the investigation.

He is complicit.
Yay. Great job!! 
Why not today?
No
Why didn’t you ever bother to even hold hearings for Merrick Garland? At a minimum he was owed hearings and an up or down vote. #stolenseat

Obviously you didn't twist any arms the president had to!get behind him or get out-of-the-way of the Trump train he's for America and American people and American values! MAGA KAG
Too bad! Thanks to the “no balls” Congress for deepening the swamp! Media needs to quit covering @RandPaul  and his little game to himself on TV and in the news, then does nothing like the rest of the cowards in the @GOP . Repugs have chosen their fear of Trump over the USA!
About time you got it done.
What's the matter with today?
If Congress gets any slower WeThePeople will need to set stakes to detect movement
Besides, #FakeNews froths!
Get it done Mitch!
Stop being so week and part of the swamp. Keep all members seven days a week till all r confirmed. Why do u continue to let the Democratic party play their games while hurting r country ???

You KNOW that he will NOT keep his pledge to Rand Paul. Shame!!
Another bad choice. Among many.
Senator McConnel. Pres Trump said at this rate it would take 9 years to get the Pres’ appointees approved. Come now, isn’t it time to change the rules? Imagine what will happen it Dems take over Senate? Pls do not leave our Pres and govt helpless!!!!!!
Great! When do we start a new war?
Merrick Garland
favorably MY ASS, @RandPaul caved like he always does & @JeffFlake is exactly what Trump said he is , A weak man with no core values!  Pompeo is ILL equipped 2 head Sec of State, He is a Racist & Homophobe & shoud have never got this far!  #BlueWave2018
Bravo!
50% don’t want #Pompeo as #SecState. We need a diplomat not an arrogant warmonger!
In 2013, Harry Reid & the Democrats led a bipartisan Senate rules change to speed up nominations for the 113th Congress. This Wednesday, the Senate Rules Committee will bring it up again, this time to make it permanent. Will the Dems support it again? #GridlockReform #Newsmakers
Let's make #NotOneDamnCent a thing until the Senate GOP gets off its collective ass and starts going 24/7 to defeat Dem obstruction @gop scorch the dems and stop playing nice. @SenateMajLdr
Aren’t you gonna lie again and tell us how great your smoke and mirrors tax give away is for the big corps while you flush the poor and middle class. You can run from us but not hide
Get to work on filling the courts with constitutional conservatives the 9th circuit and other ASAP and why hasn’t @RichardGrenell been confirmed ambassador to Germany this is a shame. Keep the senate in session 24/7 and confirm all nominees before summer!
Torturer
No. He is not qualified!
Our country is in constant crisis mode because of Trump's favorite billionaires being placed in positions of power.  Do not confirm.
Why then, Weasel Mitch, was Donny Dotard claiming obstruction? 

Oh...probably got confused with his investigation
Very disappointed in GOP, no repeal and replacement!!!
Merrick Garland
No, we didn't miss it. What a spineless bunch you have there, Mitch.
#JustDoIt and stop lolligagging around. @mcCONnellpress
ALL RELATIONS ARE FOREIGN TO THIS ADMINISTRATION!!!
And then get tough with the Democrats obstructing so many of the Presidents appointments!! NO ONE GOES HOME TIL ALL ARE VOTED ON & APPROVED!  It is in your power so USE IT!
Nothing to be proud of....
Just another example of @SenateGOP Caving to party pressure
Merrick Garland
You mean he barely made it out of committee with string reservations because he’s a freakin liar! You two should get along well. Time to retire, Mitch. You are as responsible as anyone for the shitshiw on our country right now.
Another Trumpite being pushed through. Guess we should be grateful that he actually has experience in the field
Good!
Please hurry up and get this done!
ASSHOLE
pipe down willya.  Your loss of the leadership gavel cannot come soon  enough
They still have to vote Moran.
How long will that last?  He’ll either resign in shame or be fired by the #LyinOrangeSlimeball
#MerrickGarland
The nation will shake its head in disbelief right after.
Yeah, we missed it Senator Senile. Good luck with having amother bigoted politician as our foreign minister.
Koch heads be killing US.  This means you.

Too bad
Do you think him and @VP Pence will finally cum out of the closet together?
M.A.G.A
Great choice. Get it done ASAP
Just step down! QUIT! Walk away! You actually cause more harm than good! #TermLimits #DraintheSwamp
Everyone knows Mike Pompeo is an exceptional candidate and will do a tremendous job as SOS! We need to put politics aside especially the @TheDemocrats and confirm him and retire the NK issue aside for the benefit of the WORLD!
Barely favorable!!
Keep adding to that swamp. #Nuremberg
Liar
Merrick Garland.
No!
Nobody missed it, with a special thanks to your freak show of a colleague Rand Paul lol
Why aren’t you back at the nursing home in bed? #oldman #geezer #oldbuzzard #liar #fraud #con #scam #shithead
Barely, #Pompeo enables torture, is a White Supremacist, and of course a liar #TrumpCrimeSyndicate #WhiteSupremacists #GOPComplicit
The Democrats are not about fair play. You need to do what needs to be done. The good old days are long gone. Get it all done the Reid way.
Boo!!!

#ICYMI You helped Russia hurt the USA
What a shame.  Pompeo does not hold to the values of this once great nation.  We will take all you corrupt GOP self-serving grifters out of office and start anew.  Pompeo won't be there long.
No. Pompeo supports torture.
Pompeo lied about being deployed during the Gulf War.  That alone should disqualify.  The US needs a diplomat as Secretary of State, not a war monger.  Pompeo is not a diplomat.
Another corrupt  act #
@SenBillNelson you are up for re-election and have voted nay to all previous nominees. What will you do this time? Florida Panhandle is watching. Remember we gave Trump his  victory and will give you a defeat b/c of the resist campaign!
Now let's get the rest done. How about staying in Washington until bills are passed and your work done. Americans are tired of excuses and want the ones sent to do the job to do it. One bill or one confirmation a month,seems like, isn't getting things done.
More #McConnellLies
Excellent!
Wish it would fail but someone bought off P Rand
Thanks to Chris Coons who is a D.
@GOP @SenateMajLdr #maga #2ndAmendment #ConcealedCarry   now time to pass national reciprocity if you want to maintain both the house and Senate. Just one simple job that you cannot seem to do!
KEEP Senate in session 24/7 until JOB IS DONE or RESIGN!
Get it done.  Ridiculous.
What about the rest? Time to put your big boy pants on and get ALL nominations confirmed!

Make the senate work 7 days a week until they confirm the rest of Trumps appointees! Come on be a leader, and fight like the liberals would if it were the other way around.
I wonder who we should all enthusiastically get behind next (you know, when this one doesn't work out)?

You need to confirm the other appointees!
This week? What are you waiting for? Do it today.  Then complete all the other nominations and stop obstructing the President we voted in.
There are hundreds of openings bc Trump hasn't nominated them.
If there are openings without nominations the positions are useless government positions.  

There are however a couple hundred nominations waiting on a vote. For example, the very qualified nomination for Ambassador to Germany.
"According to the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, Trump has yet to nominate anyone for about one-third of the 640 jobs that the group has identified as "key positions" in the executive branch, not counting judicial and military posts." -- LA Times, March 25, 2018
Perfect.  Leave them empty.  Confirm the ones with nominations.  

He doesn’t have to confirm 100% of what someone else deemed key before they ALL go for a vote. It matters what President Trump defines as key.  For those ones he has nominations that have been ignored.
You need to
No I did not miss it....and he made it out due to the grace and comity of a Democrat switching a vote to "present" instead of "against".  A Republican that was away was needed to report favorably otherwise.
And he has lied about his military service
Now is the time to do more confirmations!
Get to work!  400 confirmations waiting, and many bills waiting for a vote!



Lying obstructionist hypetcrit that would be you Mitch.
Bad choice
PROTECT MUELLER, TURTLE
.@SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan Cabinet Members r funding their lavish personal lifestyle at the expense of #TaxPayers-Check & Balance excesses of d #ExecutiveBranch-Do Ur job! #BootPruitt
So you will allow the vote Mitch?
No vote like DACA?
No vote like gun control?
No vote like protecting Mueller?
No vote like supreme court justice?
Them Damn Democratic obstructionist!
#GOPshame #GOPCorruption #RIPgop
Turtle on the half shell.
Why not confirm him today? Stop dragging your feet, do your job. Now!


Thank you
Plausible Deniability

History will not be kind to you. #TraitorGOP #Complicit
Great news!!  Good job @SenateMajLdr He'll make a strong SOS.
Gee, it would have been great if you were this enthusiastic for #PresidentObama nominations.
The torture secretary

I’m sure his wife’s family could help answer some of that...as they say, “follow the money!” 
Start planning next sec of state confirmation now, when Pompeo fired this fall you will be ready

Is he still having secret meetings with russian assets?
and the nation will vote you out of your leadersip role
Party before country at all costs!!!!! Shameful
You need to follow Ryan out the door.  Time for change
