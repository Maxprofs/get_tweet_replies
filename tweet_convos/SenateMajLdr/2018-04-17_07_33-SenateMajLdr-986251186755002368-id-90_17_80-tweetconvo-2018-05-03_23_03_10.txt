Support our President,  stop the filibuster.  Now
Get your act together, shut down #Mueller in this obvious attempt to overthrow a sitting @POTUS , so far you are perceived as part of the cover up by your inaction, disgraceful you do not stand up against the deep state, perhaps you really are conflicted

How you doing fighting wars, Weasel Mitch?

Authorize any?
When are you gone?

And with that we come full circle from 2016, when McConnell refused bipartisanship for a warning about Russian tampering during the election. https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698 …
I’m sure they will help you as you helped them protecting Mueller. Oh wait...
You need to follow Paul Ryan and resign..it's time to bring fresh ideas to the Senate...time to go

All I know of is the Russian money laundering except in the case of @SenateMajLdr - he and his wife @ElaineChao also ran arms and cocaine to and from Iran, funding MEK after @BarackObama ended the progra…
#TraitorMcConnell
Wow a lot of double talk.
Who owns you
How about ensuring passage of a Mueller protection? You won’t even take it to the floor! Do you know your constituents in Kentucky want this! In fact the majority of America wants Mueller protected! Are you forgetting who you work for!
How about you #ProtectMueller?
#POTUS must sunburn often, but quite frankly, I’m not concerned.

#firstaidMitch
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle 

What are you doing to stop investigation, or get appointments approved or implementing nuclear option?
Why were you silent while Russia was attacking our elections?  Don’t worry, US knows.
Like what missions?
B.S. Mitch is a SPINELESS JELLYFISH. He never stood up to Trump's idiotic and immoral statements. Trump and his LYING LACKY REPUBLICANS are destroying the USA.
I am an Independent voter and in the upcoming elections I WILL NOT vote for a single REPUBLICAN.
Others, do the same!!!
An edited prior tweet.
DAG Rosenstein needs to give Mueller a reminder that he is a special counsel not a special prosecutor.
Give Mueller until August 1, 2018 to finish or fire Rosenstein and Mueller.
Let's see what it says.
That really let the Americans know what you want passed...

Sounds like more repeal, saftey net distruction
You need to vote against any referendum that limits DJT’s ability for military action because Congress can’t do anything that supports USA or DJT. By the time you all make a decision we will have been taken over by ISIS or blown up by NK.
Anyone who fails to support the Coast Guard needs a swift kick in the ass.  Perhaps MANY kicks in the ass.

No
Your terrific tax bill gets me $60 more each paycheck!!! Next year it’ll cost me four times that. 

Thanks for nothing.

Jerk.
That's it. "ICYMI" is officially dead.

#GOPTaxBillScam
Wondering if you could be just a little more vague? "...Authorization Act, a comprehensive package that equips an adaptable force to meet a host of important missions." Thanks for ZERO TRANSPARENCY
https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/986255845901127687 … and it looks like a convicted Criminal might get the Primary for Republicans. in W. Virginia. I see that you and the RNC are trying to stop it kinda like what the Dems did to Bernie Sanders for the Presidental seat.
Corporations have already laid off 100,000 American workers in 2018. Meanwhile, corporate CEOs are fattening their wallets with stock buybacks thanks to the #TrumpTax. #TaxDay
more bull? Y DON'T U DO UR JOB, BRING SOME OF THOSE 100'S OF BILLS U HAVE UP FOR A VOTE?Y DON'T U PROTECT MULLER? because of U we have the most unqualified judges, & cabinet member EVER! they r blowing thru mils. of taxpayers money for personal wants. #VoteThemAllOut
It's a start. Thank you. Can we get the rest of President Trumps people through the approval process now?  Thank you again for holding the supreme court seat open for Gorsuch to fill!! Smart! Support the Trump agenda 100%. BUILD THE WALL!!! LOCK HER UP!
Support Trump or move on!
bot
Does it allow for global warming?
You are a liar.
Beautifully broad..  "to meet a host of important missions.." Lol come on. Your constituents would like some details..
Please go on a faraway adaptive mission and stay.
You must resign.
Have you been compromised by the Russians to?
Asking for a friend.
Lying Mich
The grand daddy of obstruction lying Mich, amitted obstruction your own words Mich nobody forgot
Retire scum

Talk about a disfunctional congress; this is not surprising for the current congress, you all need to get out!
What is the evil and corrupt @GOP doing about the #CRIMINALPresident?
What about a bill to protect Mueller? That's more important than your stupid hemp bill which you are fast tracking. Even if you feel it's not necessary then why not just appease the American people and put it to a vote? I guess you and the @GOP are afraid of being found complicit
#ProtectMueller #ProtectRosenstein @realDonaldTrump has STATED he has been TOLD to fire Mueller. STAND UP FOR #RuleOfLaw!
We did miss it because you were too busy whining and bitching about nominees that end up getting approved but you have to vote cloture for first. In other words, you were too busy complaining about your job.
What scam are you plotting now? #GOPTaxScam
Why didn't your K STREET LOBBYISTS include 32.5 million taxpayers in your TAX RELIEF you keep bragging about? And won't the high price of gas/heating fuel wipe out most of the TAX RELIEF another 32.5 million got? WALL ST. TRAITORS?
Are the BILLIONAIRES being made by the WALL ST. TRAITORS real people paying USA TAXES on that illgotten money or are they phony names set up offshore?
I think you should get on board with the Trump agenda or you're going to find yourself on the way out.
how about stepping up and getting rid of a Senate made up filibuster!!! our founding fathers never signed this stupid rule!!! if not, step down
When are you going to attempt to end the filibuster rule for appropriation and authorization bills?
If @SenateGOP does not and have to resort to CRs and OMNIBUS, it’s likely to cause @GOP voter apathy.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @JohnCornyn
What does this even mean?
They all want a bill to protect mueller and you won’t bring to the floor. So 
We’re long overdue to refit, modernize and upgrade the @USCG given the depth and breadth of their mission and OPTEMPO these past 17 years
CONFIRM #GRENELL
I HOPE EACH SENATOR #confirmsGrenell & all other @StateDept posts waiting for the Dems 2 stop being radicalized. Time for #nuclearoption! positions w/o sitting ambassadors is nothing more than Dems trying 2 hurt @POTUS & USA. @SenSchumer should be embarrassed! @RichardGrenell
Pass something that conservatives actually want... CONCEALED CARRY RECIPROCITY.
I know you’re like 100 in #Turtle years and a staff member does these #Tweets, but it’s still our duty to tell you to #RESIGN!
So, you are literally still adding to the budget. EVEN after the GOP is running up historic debt. #GOPTaxScam
What’s your progress on allowing hemp to be developed by farmers? Very important.
Should be zero if government subsidized.
Like ethanol, subsidies take food crops out of play.
Follow Ryan out the door or support Trump
Resign


I’m so ready for Friday, be sure to register people to vote at your walk out! High schoolers can even register ppl! 
https://www.headcount.org/ 
When are you going to #RESIGN?
No, President Trump isn’t going anywhere.
Members of congress have gotten really good at playing "avoid anything having to do with Trump", but you're going to have to address his impropriety sooner rather than later.
go away, he won fair and square!! time to grow up.. impropriety?? you mean Obama administration officials for wiretapping and unmasking innocent AMERICANS or the clinton's for their illegal acts.. give me a break
You sound like a two-year-old Joseph. Trump is a criminal. His cronies are already pleading guilty or indicted. You have no defense except old worn out complaints about Obama or Hillary. You have zero defense. Go sit down somewhere. You're boring us & you lose.
