What about Taxpayers subsidizing an education system that has embraced communism and declared war on the rest of us? Worst part, they are using our own children at our expense. I say, privatize education now.
Joe Donnelly for Indiana. Obviously.
I live in Indiana and my vote is going  to Joe Donnelly this fall #BlueWave
Then why the heck didn’t you defund sanctuary cities in the omnibus budget that was just passed and give that money to the wall that majority of the citizens want! Nothing like political grandstanding and a late to the game move!
How about we stop subsidizing Trumps golf trips & businesses, his grifter kids boondoggles,, and his sleazy cabinets lavish spending
Saw the interview Luke and appreciate you taking the lead on this.  Immigration policies have been weak for a very long time!  #ILikeLuke
Not sure mister Indiana really wants to highlight funding givers and takers by state.
There are thousands and thousands of legal Americans who are not citizens what a racist you are!
If they or you are not here illegally then it does not apply to them or you.
You're so full of shit
what ever happened to states rights? Is it a good thing to force local cops to act as federal cops?
No!
More CONgress BS. 
We already have legislation. These "leaders" are #BreakingTheLaw & need #ChromeBracelets immediately. 
Is there any rule-of-law for bureaucrats, politicians & "elites"?!?!?

Busloads of corruption unpunished.

Congrats on writing a great house tweet! http://greathousetweets.measuredvoice.com/RepLukeMesser/status/984017870681268224 … (Ranked 31st for Apr 11.)
Does that mean the state can stop making payments to the feds?
WTF??? Your 'leader' is in meltdown and you spend your time on this CRAP? #MesseredUp
Looked good   from voters in In.6

Thank you for supporting POTUS and going after the Swamp.
@RepLukeMesser is the friggin swamp #Messeredup Get a clue and try again
If a state wants to go against the law of the nation then you would assume they would understand the actions they chose would have a reaction.  I am saddened that my hard earned money would support illegal activity and I can’t control it!
Hahaha #MesseredUp
And now you know why the demwits have their panties in a big wad. The citizenship question on the next census will not only cut unjustified fed dollars for illegals it also determines the number of Congressional Reps. Politicians that spend fed $'s on illegals r committing fraud.
STOP TODAY FUNDING SANTUARY CITIES IN!!! Take it and help the homeless. Or any other needy area!!
I also support HS 5404!  Could you discuss this please?
Just saw you on Fox.  I agree with you completely. Its hard to understand why there are some that don't agree with us, isn't it? Good luck in the senate race. God bless you.
@freedomcaucus @HouseGOP Funding #SanctuaryCities undermines our @TheJusticeDept who seeks to cut all Federal taxpayer funds to assist in violating U. S. #Immigration #Laws #StopFundingSanctuaryCities @SenateGOP
Joining @foxandfriends to discuss my legislation that would stop U.S. taxpayers from subsidizing sanctuary cities! Tune in! 
Think I like this guy, he made sense.  Now if the RINOs will support his Bill.
This would be a GREAT thing for America!

Lawless cities don’t deserve taxpayer money!

@trumps_feed @foxandfriends F you Luke. I am much more concerned with Russian collusion.
