NEW: Following announcement by North and South Korea, @RepLukeMesser pushes for Pres. Trump to be nominated for Nobel Peace Prize @WISH_TV #Daybreak8 #INSen 
No.
What happened to chastising Obama for wanting to initiate direct talks? Kim is an “honorable man?” Really? How many innocent people has he had killed? If Obama ever said that, you guys would’ve called for his impeachment. The level of republican hypocrisy is stunning! Fool!

Lying Luke wants to nominate Donnie for NOT getting involved in the peace process formed by a collapsing nuke site and negotiations by China and South Korea. https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/22/politics/donald-trump-north-korea-insults-timeline/index.html … The sole reason is because KJ couldn’t take the Crazy route anymore, that’s been taken by Donnie.
Ok, now please explain it to us. Why are you nominating him? President Moon Jae-in is the one who started the talks, President Moon Jae-in is the one who brought them to the table, President Moon Jae-in is the one who reached out to both leaders. So why TRUMP? What for?
He hasn’t done anything yet
