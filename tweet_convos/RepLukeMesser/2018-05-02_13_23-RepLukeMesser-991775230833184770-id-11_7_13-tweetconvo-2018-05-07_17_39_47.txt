THE Luke Messer? The guy who won  his seat with questionable money, so desperate for Trump approval that he constantly sucks up to the old man and now nominates Trump for a Peace Prize for Korea while here at home the country is suffering from GOP abuse and incapable leadership

LUKE, YOU’RE THE DUMBEST OF FUCKS!m
