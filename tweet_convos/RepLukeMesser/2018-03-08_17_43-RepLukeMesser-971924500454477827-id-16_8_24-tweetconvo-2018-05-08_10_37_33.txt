I'm just going to go out on a limb here and predict that this Tweet won't age well.
You have to be one of the shallowest thinkers in Congress. Are you trying to replace Louie Gohmert as the dumbest congressman? Good lord....
Hey, @RepLukeMesser Maybe you should read this:
North Korea has been seeking a summit with an American president for more than twenty years. It has literally been a top foreign policy goal of Pyongyang since Kim Jong Il invited Bill Clinton. (1/3)
@RepLukeMesser If Obama had done this, you’d be shouting how naive he is and how Kim Jong Un was paying him for a fool.
Trump deserves NO credit for this and odds are good that he will F it up.  If you want to thank someone, call Putin or Moon Jae-in. Remember, you were elected by the people of Indiana and we expect you to represent us NOT suck up to an inept president.  And STOP taking NRA $$$.
You’ve been working pretty hard for the Trump endorsement. I guess you dont care about Stormy Daniels, Russian collusion, obstruction of justice, nepotism, sex scandals, supporting white supremacists. Doesn’t he deserve to be impeached!? #Impeach #copyandpaste
Maybe wait to see what actually happens first? Pretty hard to believe NK is just going to go “okie dokie, we’ll stop with the nukes. You win.” Don’t you think?
I hope you're right. I strongly suspect that isn't the case. This is most likely your "Mission accomplished  " tweet. I've preserved it for posterity just in case.... @thehill
This is one huge Nothing Burger!!
You think Kim will give up his Nuclear power to Trump is the thinking of something less than juvenile!
Trump can’t give us health care or talk to high school kids!
Seriously?? You must be joking! Trump has shown himself to be an utter laughingstock and you siding with him does you no favors.
Good for him, I guess crazy works sometimes
Do you support Putin’s use of chemical nerve agents to kill dissidents?
