If talks with North Korea lead to concrete action, @realDonaldTrump should be well on his way to a Nobel Peace Prize, and unlike President Obama, this time it would be well deserved. https://messer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=812 …
You’re crazy @RepLukeMesser or this is a joke.
Wow! Time to #resign He's officially lost his marbles!
LOL.
So, Trump escalates the threat to an all-time high. When he de-escalates it back to where it was, he’s a hero?

Ok. Got it.

Btw - how are his “Christian” values sitting with you these days?
Language alert:
Dems would LOSE THEIR SHIT.

Since @RepLukeMesser deleted his original tweet—>

lol!  what a load of shit!  #MesseredUp
Heard a news report on I believe Bloomberg that the Nobel Committee is investigating a forged application for Trump to be awarded the prize. Wonder if these 2 things are related?
Yeah, somebody already tried that. #TrumpFail
