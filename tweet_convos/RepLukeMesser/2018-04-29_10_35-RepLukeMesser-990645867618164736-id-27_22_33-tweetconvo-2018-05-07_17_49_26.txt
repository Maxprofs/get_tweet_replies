Deficit borrowing up 84% since Obama. Stocks in red for 2018, down since #GOPTaxScam. Trade war hurting rural farmers. Dollar value, tourism industry down. Wages stagnant. Gas, healthcare costs up.  But thanks for extra $1.50 a paycheck #FireAllRepublicans
After you come in 3rd next week, please just delete your account.
Sir, this zeal of late on your part to align your position as closely as possible to that of the Very Stabe Genius does not increase your appeal to this conservative voter.

You seriously believe that insulting tweets made this happen?  Are you as naive as Trump who hasn't figured out he's being played? Or that the US leaving the peninsual will be one of the conditions? Who put you in office?

You are just looking for your 15 minutes of fame. #Sitdown #VoteThemOut2018

I think John Bolton might try to throw a wrench in that deal. Hes not too keen on Korean peace process.
Are those your experts, Fox news fanatics? Come on people start paying attention to what is really going on!
Are you kidding? Strong again? The world is laughing at us. Foreign leaders have figured out how to play him. Peace through respect is honorable. This mad doesn't understand the concept of respect.


Amen
Hmm I don’t see anyone from America in this video #DipShit
Trump is a pawn in all of this. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15018268 ….
I was gong to vote for you but you seem to be very secret for some reason. I can’t find your position on anything except...”I support Trump” but what does that mean?
He had nothing to do with it. It is actually an elaborate trap that KJU has set, and Trump doesn't realize it. And apparently, neither do you.
So many things wrong with this. 1: “Proud to join @IngrahamAngle “ Proud to join a woman who goes after children? Shameful
Wtf are you talking about?! America is the laughing stock of the world right now!!
Lol...Trump is a dotard & will probably screw things up as always.  Also...if anything...President Moon will deserve a Nobel Peace Prize if peace truly happens.  Trump won’t be able to take that Nobel Prize to prison anyway.
