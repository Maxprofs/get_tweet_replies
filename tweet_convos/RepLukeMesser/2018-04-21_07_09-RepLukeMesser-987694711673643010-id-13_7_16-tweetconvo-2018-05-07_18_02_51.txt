We've seen more progress in North Korea than we saw during the entire Obama administration, and it’s a direct result of @realDonaldTrump's strong leadership on the world stage.
One could argue the cumulative affect of years of sanctions got us to this point but no, let's be dishonest and say the president's name-calling will solve the Korean nuclear problem.
Why did you hide your DUIs? We expect an answer now!
What about those DUIs, anything to say on that?

It always helps n making progress against our enemies when you don't have a POTUS (& his entire regime-Obama/Clinton/Podesta/Soros/McAuliffe Cartel) who have aided & abetted those enemies! Let's look at North Korea & Iran Did Russia get that uranium via URANIUM ONE (1 of 2)
(2 of 2) Don't overlook this part of the Treasonous Iran Deal  WHO WERE THE 14 UNKNOWNS that Obama, via IRAN DEAL, released, dropped charges against & removed Interpol Red notices ....
Your grasp on foreign policy is embarrassing. But only that ignorance would compel somebody to say something that so glaringly proves this. I suggest you research this topic more, as to not look so foolish in the future.
The fact the you're the fifth ranking anything is amazing given your lack of forethought and decorum. Hopefully you're up for re-election and will get voted out before you can do more serious damage to america's reputation abroad.
UnderSellingRepMesser We have seen more progress in 15 months than in 4 + Decades #ThatIsTheFacts Thank you Mr. @POTUS #China #NOKO #SOKO
Poppycock!! It’s the work of Putin creating a distraction and trying to make trump look good.
You are out of your f*cking mind
