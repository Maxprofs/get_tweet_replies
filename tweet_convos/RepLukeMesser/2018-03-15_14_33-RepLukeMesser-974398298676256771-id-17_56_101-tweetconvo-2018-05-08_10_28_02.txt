#Democrats are more patriotic Americans than #Republicans.Immigration is inalienable to the foundation of America,
America has always opened it's doors to migrants,
for #DonaldTrump to close those doors is un-American and un-patriotic.

Good Christians tearing apart families?  Sleep tight.
There have to be laws. We have commandments, it’s the same idea. Don’t use a moral high ground as the basis of your argument. It doesn’t get the debate anywhere and it just insults the person you are talking to. God Bless 
Blessed are the Merciful
While the GOP puts the interests of anyone with money ahead of the interests of the American people. We can’t catch a break either way.

Humanity vs cost. Obama also had a higher deportation rate than the previous President, huh, your lying again Liuke AND you’re trying to distract from the  whole story. You are NOT a patriot. You are not in the interest of US by excusing the Trump administration.
.@RepLukeMesser: "It just gives you an example of how out of touch the Republicans are...They literally are starting to put the interests of @realDonaldTrump before the interests of American citizens because they somehow think it's gonna help them win our next election."
Unless you have voter I’d and verify that voters are us citizens then it is very possible!!!!
You are out of touch and soon to be out of office.
Pot calling the kettle black, everything out of his mouth is about being elected a senator.
