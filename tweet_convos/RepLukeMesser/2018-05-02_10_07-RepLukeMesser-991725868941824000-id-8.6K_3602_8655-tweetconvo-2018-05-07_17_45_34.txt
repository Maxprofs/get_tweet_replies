lolololololololololololololol
You and your 17 buddies are f#*king crazy
@PattiEllis13 !! WTF?!

Some would say that you are pathetic, ass-kissers with no concern for truth or reality.
Many cave-dwellers and coma patients don't know this.

 he has done nothing. WTF is this?

I’m so glad the Karolinska institute is in Stockholm & not Russia/China or even . Doubt any world leader can bully them into giving Trump a NPP. 
I don't think you have to do anything special. Obama docet.
It helps if the nominee isn't under criminal investigation and embroiled in lawsuit involving hush money he paid to silence the porn star he slept with right after his wife gave birth to his son whilst he carried on an affair with a former Playboy model.
At least he's a life.
English is not your first language is it?
Didn’t realize threatening a country with utter destruction made someone eligible for the Peace Prize
President Trump did nothing but trade insults with a dictator. If insulting someone on Twitter is worthy of a Nobel Prize then nearly every user on this platform should recieve a nomination... even the bots...
Obama did nothing but bomb 7 countries over 7 years creating the worst refugee crisis in history and he got the Nobel Peace Prize. I don’t see you complaint about that.
He got the prize in 2009...
They don’t give Those awards to men that purposely turn a blind eye to refugee children, WHILE bombing their countries. Or riling up bigots to scream at immigrants trying to escape war-torn druglands.
Un-fucking-believable!!  Really??!!  Do you even KNOW the criteria for the Nobel Peace Prize??  trump is about as far as opposite of promoting peace as you can get.
Anybody involved in this bs is a traitor to this country. You clearly only want to please your master’s endless need for praise. You don’t care about your constituents. Shame on you! This masquerade is disgusting
Where do the people get to vote at??? Oh wait that's right...
I can hear the laughter emanating from Norway right now. “Trump is a jævla rævhål!”
Oh brother
You do realize that the Nobel committee will just pitch this in the trash, don’t you? Why do Republicans always want to make blazing fools of themselves?
What a freaking joke. You and your 16 house colleagues disgust me.

Absurd.
Morons
You are a next level comedian, Bruh. This sh*t is going to be hilarious in a few years.
I nominate you as the leader of the Cult of Trump.
Nice typo.  "...in recognition of his work to end to the Korean War...."
Wow! Are you all stupid!!!
HAHAHA my nuclear button is bigger than yours Kim. You people are delusional
Thank you for the list of who to vote out.  Much appreciated
You got something on your nose
Oh good lord! How do the tweets and taunts fit in with the overall mission of the Nobel Prize? Read a book buddy!
That means that 18 House Republicans are nutjobs. Tell us something we don't already know.  Enjoy your ride on the #BlueWave this fall.  I'm sure you'll find something else to do in flyover country.
The blow job crew list is complete. Line up shills.
That's time well-spent serving constituents. You work really hard and effectively for your tax-payer funded income, don't you?
Sure.  Why not the Nobel Prize in Chemistry or Physics, too, while you're at it?
Where’s Putin’s signature? Never mind it’s covered up by @GOP as usual traitors for money.
If they had a Nobel Piss Prize, it would be more appropriate. 
Trump is an American disgrace, and so is every single person that supports his fleecing of America.
Wow- the stupid it burns!
Disgusting
Congrats on being out of your mind.   Have fun losing everything in Nov.
This is about the funniest thing I've seen all day
I implore all @NoblePrize selection committee members to reject the nomination of Donald J. Trump, Sr., President of the United States.

Mr. Trump antagonized Kim Jong-un, Leader of North Korea, with blatant taunts and threats of nuclear war.

It would be a disgrace to the prize
Yes because Obama who actually made the world less safe through his not leading at all let alone from behind received the Nobel PP for what exactly. Clown post by a Lib who obviously doesn't have a clue. Your hatred will eat out you insides.
Less safe how?? Didn’t see him calling Kim Jong-Un Litttle Rocket Man or say his nuclear button was bigger! Come on now, just how stupid are you?
When the guy who nominated you for a #NobelPrize is the same guy trying to commit obstruction of justice for you.

Mark, a quick refresh...

A Constitutional Crisis is when a presidential nominee works with a foreign adversary in order to attack and undermine another candidate, take the office of president, and then exploit that power in order to enrich themselves along the way. #TrueStory

Congress voted 517-5 to impose sanctions on Russia. The President decides to ignore that law. Folks that is a constitutional crisis. There should be outrage in every corner of this country.
Our Commander-N-ChiefI've not experienced a President work as long & hard as President Trump ~
Have u just become awakened from a long coma?! Otherwise you’ve been lobotomized by Trump and his cronies! Work hard!!!??? He plays effing golf 1/3 of his time in office!
Remember this acronym: "IOKIYAR". Any Republican president is allowed to take as many vacation days as they want and play golf as much as they want. A Democrat must never take time off.
Pfft
I’m feeling you there Winston
If this actually happens, I will have lived to see Trump disgrace even the NPP.

This is a joke, right?
Oh brother!
Ass kissing, brown nosers!  If y’all were any further up @realDonaldTrump ‘s ass...  My God! Get a spine—you don’t have nominate him just because he told you to.


Hahahahahahahahahahaha. No.
Unfortunately no. Delusional Rs.
Hahahajajajjajasjhahhahahahhahahhahahahahaahhahahahhahahahhhahhahhahhahahaaajaahahahajahahhahaajhahhhhahhahahahhhhahahaahahhajajajaajjajaahhahahahahahahahhhahhshhjahhahahshahhsha

Who is running against this asshat so I can make a donation?
How desperate are you republicans for jobs? #BlueWaveComing2018
If anyone deserves it he does,but I bet a pound to a pinch of shit he doesn’t
Well, I’m glad he is showing us a list.  Everyone make sure to copy it and vote them OUT.  Simple as that.
So blind. So dangerous. So delusional. What is the 'important' agenda? To save Trump? Try saving your people and trying to repair the damage this man is doing! Or you can prove that the Nobel committee can be bought. Your children will be so proud of this clown move. Shame!
You have no say so bugger off.
Three things Obama has that Trump will never have:

1. A Nobel Peace Prize
2. An 8-yr presidency 
3. Class
4. Ability to form complete sentences.
5. Scandal-free presidency.
6. One marriage.
Number 5 is a complete joke.

Your meme is bs.  I never resisted President Obama.  I didn't agree with all of his actions but I never acted in the childish manner like you resistors have done.  And no, you don't have to be racist to disagree with a political figure.
You’re funny! 
You have no argument.
I@ in a good mood tonight, so I don’t need to argue with a wall. Kthxbye
This is almost as worthless as your attempt to impeach Rod Rosenstein 
By next Feb, KJU will have blown up the deal and no one will be talking Nobel Peace Prize for the 
Maybe they were submitting for next year’s award? I’m not sure how early they can ask. 

Then again, like an employee of the month or another award, if you have to ask for it, you probably aren’t deserving of it.
It's so premature it's ridiculous.  Nothing substantive has even happened yet and NK could easily blow up the deal later like they did in 2000 and 2007.  I'm almost certain they will.  KJU isn't REALLY going to give up his nukes.
I totally agree. I think they are getting played to some degree. I don’t think anyone in this admin deserves anything other than jail time. Lol
LOL Word!
Are you all on crack?!?
You and your 17 House colleagues are what is wrong with the world.
We are campaigning for Trump to win the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.
The campaign will end on Dec 31, 2018 and send the list of the contributor to the Norwegian Nobel committee.
Please visit  https://www.donaldtrumpfornobelpeaceprize.com/ 
Maybe the noble yeast prize!
How embarrassing!

Right...........
What an absolute joke
That's not how one nominates a candidate  but thanks for further confirming that his application was a forgery #lockupalltraitors
This is the stupidest thing on the face of the planet. You don’t give a peace prize to someone who threatened killing millions of people through nuclear war because he was suffering from penis envy.
An
You've got to be joking a president's getting ready to be impeached work with the Russians he's a plan for adulterer and just in general everything that the American people aren't a big fat bully
Your a Joke!
Trump did nothing but hinder the process. Yelling & tweeting didn't stop anything. The sanctions, sure. But you think Donald Trump (who skips most of his breifings) did that? Nikki Hailey, Rex Tillerson, and 100s of people behind the scenes. Certainly not Twitter Fingers.
Yeah the committee is going to read the letter and say great we will give it to Moon!
I can see the reason why the idea is floating around. Obama got one in 2009. But then again, Obama was working hard, visiting other countries, holding meetings, etc. 

Not flying down to Florida every chance he could get
Reading the snarling, ignorant and deranged responses lefties are having to this, I'm left mostly with a sense of pity at how empty their own lives must be.
They wave their little #Resist-ance flags and sneer about racism, fascism and hate...
Do they even know what a mirror is?
Corrupt TrAitor!!!
But he dies of a massive coronary 09/23/18.

Great list to use as a reference for who Not to vote for in upcoming elections.
Hell. Fucking. NO!!! There’s no way that thing is on the same level as some of my heroes: Methai, Madella, Carter...
The guy you're nominating wants to shut down the Iran Deal, and give Iran a chance to develop nuclear weapons. They don't award the #NobelPrize for that!
You're just looking for something to run on in Nov. You guys know a blue  is coming!


That's not how you start a knock-knock joke!
Uh! To bad, so sad they missed the deadline! February! So much for brainiacs! LOL! Yours always, Blue Cream puff!
So what, he was nominated. After your boys award it'd meaningless now anyway. Why you following me blue cream puff? We are opposites. 
You can thank me later for your new favorite handle, blue cream puff. Maybe change your profile.
#bye #trollbot #botnet
You and those who signed are certifiably INSANE OR he's paid you well OR you're guilty of something associated with Trump... in other words he's blackmailing you all. 

STOP THIS INSANITY.  Trump isn't fit for public service. He's an embarrassment to this country. JUST STOP!!!
Ok lol.
You still don't see the writing on the wall do you?
They can't read Cyrillic.
Fucking embarrassments. The whole lot of you.

Don’t count your chickens before they are hatched.
You can vote all you want on this. Even if he won he would never be able to collect. Norway will never let that SOB into their country. That would be like letting Brevik out of jail. Never gonna happen.
You are f'ing insane and this is evidence of that. Nothing has happened. Nothing has changed. 
#morons
You are a despicable,  spineless lot of ignoramuses. Is there an award for that?
The deadline for nominations was Feb 1st. Maybe you can try again next year, if you’re still in office and don’t accrue any more DUIs.
Even Hitler was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize 
Not surprised somebody would nominate Trump.
Sweden needed a good laugh.
strange -the last nobel PP  was offered to a terrorist !
You are all TRAITORS and will be expelled from OUR House come November 6th. #DisgustingSycophants #TrumpForPrison2020

#VoteThemOut2018 #BlueWaveComing2018
 
Did you meet the deadline for the nomination?????? 
No but seriously, why is he being nominated???
Why...... ..why.... I can't!
Should be many more signatures on this letter. #MAGA
Have you lost your freaking mind? Peace Prize? All he has done is create chaos in America. I thought we were taking care of America first???? #fakechristians #zombieapocalypse
So....much....stupid......
Yes, well deserved
Only a Nobel Peace Prize, why not throw in Trump for sainthood? And for Kim Jung Un too. Although GOP more comfortable honoring a white madman.
Can’t help but wonder how he either bribed or threatened them all.

Are the 18 of you working on a comedy routine to take on the road after the mid-term elections?

Oh this is great!! I didn't realize this was a satire account! 
Bravo! 
Well done.

Next step beatification
Did you tell #RudyGiuliani  about your plan, cause he just *uck it up for you, #Why
By bulling, name calling & threatening war? What about that behavior is worthy of the @NobelPrize? NOTHING!
Why not nominate Kim Jong Yun.. Wow don’t people understand that either trump or Kim Jong receiving this award cheapens the honor of this award?
Beyond disgusting
OMG!!!....To put #Trump at the level of #NelsonMandela, #MartinLutherKing, #HenryKissinger, #AndreiSahkarov, #AnwarSadat, #MenachemBegin, #MotherTeresa, #DesmondTutu, #DalaiLama, #MikhailGorbachev, #JimmyCarter, #BarackObama, is absolutely appalling!! He is a disgrace!!!
No, wrong!!!
What is wrong with you?
The plant collapse
Kim wanted to participate in the Olympics 
What did #45 negotiate, a meeting that hasn't happened?
Wake up!!!
And today I vowed to donate to each of your opponents!
God he is OBSESSED with being Obama!! Obama gets one therefore he must and his minions are doing his bidding. How about he actually achieves some sort of agreement then let’s talk.
FOR WHAT? Planning on setting up a meeting? What kompromat does Russia/Trump have on you and your colleagues?

Is it April Fool's day? #MoronsAreGoverningAmerica
Every day is April fools day in this dispensation
Too bad. So sad. *sad horn sounds here* 
I nominate Donald's boss, Vladimir Putin.

WHAT ABOUT A NOBEL PEACE MEDAL FOR THAT PERSON THERE PROFF HOW CEMICAL GET GET OUT OF A  GAS BOTTLE WITH OUT ANY HOLE IN IT
Luke, it would be easier if you just got down on your knees and closed your eyes.
Wasn't aware Nobel Peace Prize is awarded for liars, sexual predators, adulterers...
You and 17 others either just woke up from a coma or are colossally stupid.
Asinine
Who forced them to sign...Harold M. Bornstein M.D.?

Get back on your meds. For all of us.
You all ate CRAZY
Trump almost started a nuclear war
Amen!
#MoronFromIndiana
For what @RepLukeMesser? For conspiring with Russia, golfing, holding rallies, tweeting, and fucking/paying porn stars? With Trump’s track record, those names (yours included), won’t qualify that prestigious award to be presented to a FAILURE! You’re up for re-election! #VoteBlue
Didn't know there were this many really, really stupid people in the House.
An outstanding gesture. Thank you
Ok that’s cool. Reminder, it is now on record (FOREVER) that you and these 17 House members, support and actually believe that trump is deserving of a #NobelPrize. Enjoy the ridicule. #RussiaCollusion #TraitorTrump
lmao
The Nobel committee accepts nominations in September. This is either very late or very early or very meaningless.
Sorry to hear about your 1 1/2 year coma.
Really?  And all of you think he has the moral values worthy of a Nobel recipient? Nobel recipients set fine examples for our children. Is Trump a good example for your children to emulate?
Per the Nobel Prize website: nominations for 2018 are closed and the nomination process for 2019 hasn't yet begun. In order for a nomination to be valid, it must be made through an online form and the 2019 form won't be active until September. https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Nomination  #GOP #PRSpin
You'll want @GWR. I'm not sure what the current record for World's Largest Circle Jerk is tho.
You are all idiots!
your boss will be pleased
you have got to be kidding. in years to come, may i suggest you plead temporary *inanity*
They can award the prize in federal prison.
Will his future warden allow his release to attend the ceremony?
Are you mental?

Butt kissing deplorables every one.
You should be nominating Putin, your real leader, instead of Trump. Putin pulled all this together. He's protecting his asset (Trump).
Rep. Luke Messer the President isn't in it for the Peace Prize. #PeaceIsThePlan
People need to realize that #PeaceIsThePrize
NEVER!! Thankfully it’s not up to sycophants. It’s up to those who believe in truth, honesty and all people, no matter if they even come from sh!thole countries, are equal. Trump doesn’t come close
for what calling names  OMG  is this satire
Why the heck?!? If he gets the Nobel Peace Prize, the whole institution will mean nothing.
I would trust that our President @realDonaldTrump is quite please with your actions, but, I bet he would be happier if you would spend your Legislative time fixing the Immigration Problem, Allocating Money for the Wall, Replacing Obamacare (permanently), and rid us from Mueller!

How about y'all do your jobs instead of stroking the ego of a narcissist?
Thank you for listing the 17 other idiot traitors. #TheResistance will set out straight away to ensure each one of you fools are voted out of office. You are clearly not fit to serve. We will also find out what the GOPDT & or  has on you as well to make such a ludicrous bid.
