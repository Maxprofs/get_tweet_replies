Please please vote NO! There is no reason we can't keep EVERYONE insured! Stop murdering people!
I'll pay for your cup of coffee if you don't want to pay it. Take it from my paychecks, tax it baby! 
Just tried to call you to re your disastrous "health care" bill is. Are you rich enough that it gives you tax breaks?
It will bankrupt me.
Do you see how many comments have poured in here in opposition? I don't know a single person who is for this bill, D or R. Vote no.
I only want to hear one word from you: NO.
Saw you on CNN u are a caring thoughtful man. Please vote down this heartless bill.  Work together to fix ACA.
People are frightened. Your people. All they need to know is that you will vote NO to wealthcare.  Or lose your seat next election.
Vote NO! I have a lot of respect for your colleague, Susan Collins is voting NO.
how bout we switch healthcare, just gov employees get new healthcare bill and I get your health coverage through OPM-
Correction:instead of replacing it
ALERT. You represent Louisiana, not just trump voters. #killercare will KILL in our state.Don't fund billionaire tax cuts with lives #VOTENO
@BillCassidy reduce the deficit not by kicking grandma out of nursing home or stop care for kids cause you're against their parents' choices
Consider the bill a weapon of the @GOP -- many will die?  Do you care?
no he doesnt! how many does he follow on twitter? not enough for them all to be his constituents. if he cared about you, he'd follow you!
Please vote no, sincerely everyone with empathy for the less fortunate #BadBill
Unlikely, it's a terrible thing to do to the American people
Is it 'I have serious concerns' or #voteno? Quit hinting. Have the guts to stand up. We need representative not word games. #voteneaux
As your constituent,  I ask you to vote no. If you have concerns with ACA, work on those.  Be an example to the citizens of this country.
First do no harm
This bill helps absolutely no one. #AHCAKills #VoteNoBCRA #VoteNo
Weirdly your voicemail is not working so you can't hear about how citizens of Louisiana feel about what YOU are doing to our health care.
Howdy, Mr. Jimmy Kimmel test! I can't stand people like you who can lie with a straight face on TV! SMH.
Bot
Tell Mitch you were not sent to DC to fall in line but lift Louisiana up. Your either going to stand up for us or leave us behind!
@SpeakerRyan thinks no one will lose health care-they will 'choose' not to buy it. Similar to I choose not to buy a Lamborghini #outoftouch
If u vote against rep bill, I will  go door to door to all I can in my district campaigning for you. Speak for the people. We will speak4u
Phone lines go to voicemail. Voicemail is full. Please publish the details of your town halls.
Please vote against trumpcare.
get some balls, stand up and declare your NO VOTE!
La. Voter here. Vote no. NEAUX!!! Immoral. Tax cut for the 1% is all McConnell cares about. Is that true for you Senator?  Again. No. 71291
You are going to tow the party line, admit it. You care about poor people? LOL
If you truly believe in the bill you wrote with Collins, fight for it! Vote NO! Which master will you serve?Your constituents or your party?

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
#DoNoHarm.
‘I will die.’ – Watch this man explain what life under Trumpcare would mean for him in brutally honest terms 
Please vote no. We who have pre-existing need you to say no.
343,400 people that you were elected to represent will lose healthcare. No amendment can fix this. Stand up for the people of LA. Vote No.
Vote no to this "mean" health care legislation. Your constituent. 70471.
Please vote no!
Please put lives & people before money & party, Trump's bill is grave & horrendous, use your heart, you should vote no! #TrumpCare
#VoteNoBCRA
Enough talking. Why is it so hard to see #killercare is horrible for Louisiana? 4th graders know. U know. Do something.  #TAKEASTAND #VOTENO
“Dead-line uncommitted”...seriously? In GOP speak that normally means "please persuade me". This bill does NOT pass the Jimmy Kimmel test!
Like @KellyannePolls  said,I got a job after my husband died.Inow have ins but so many of my fellow Louisianians are not in position2do same
Do the right thing for your constituents and vote NO on this foolish bill.  You know better. This is just cruel for LA. #NoCutsToMedicaid
Please oppose this new, dreadful version of #Trumpcare. Your constituents won't forget it, nor will the people you help by voting NO.
Stay strong @BillCassidy please do not vote for this bill!!
ALERT. You represent me in Louisiana, not McConnell. #killercare will KILL in our state. Don't fund billionaire tax cuts with lives. #VOTENO
LA will lose 10B in federal Medicaid $ under GOP bill forcing cuts to nursing home & in-home care. Vote NO!!! Take care of your own!
Another Lie from the left Medicaid $390b this year, going to $520
By 2026
74% of Louisianans living in nursing homes rely on #Medicaid. GOP bill's $800B Medicaid cut is wrong.
Please listen to the CBO Score, @AARP. @AmerAcadPeds, @ahahospitals & vote No for AHCA. It is bad for Americans.
For goodness sake, show that u have a spine. If money donors go away, you will always have the voters u represented. Put us before politics
I could tell u a really sad story about my deceased husband, but I won't. Just know obamacare and Medicaid made treatment&the end bearable.
I don't need to repeat the numbers to u. It is devastating how many children and seniors who will lose coverage. Vote no.
Please vote no. Prove you are loyal to those in Louisiana who have no voice/influence.Do not let $$ and power sway u frm doing right.

If you're 60 years old and make *any* amount of money, get ready for premiums to go way up under the Senate bill.

Please do the right thing and vote NO on this plan. People before party 
How come you're still undecided about the Mean and Heartless Healthcare bill? I'm tired of bait and switch. You'll vote yes in the end.
Damn straight. He's got his donors to worry about. Pathetic politicians are the status quo! #Sad
Graham on Healthcare
“Here’s what I would tell any senator, if you’re counting on the President to have your back, you need to watch it."
Talk healthcare? Bull shit. This is a tax cut, that is all. You should be ashamed for even considering this atrocious bill.
The #CBOScore is enough to show how bad this bill is for the healthcare system and Americans. Do right by your constituents& #VoteNoBCRA
U are invited to meet w/ a citizen w/ cerebral palsy who will be directly impacted by Medicaid cuts. Do your job & come to #NOLA, you wimp!!
Please vote NO. Millions of lives are at stake!
We need you to vote no on the healthcare bill, it's not about party it's about Louisiana. #Badbill
PLEASE VOTE NO
Please vote NO on this bill. Your constituents need better than this. Stand up for us!
Please dont approve that bill because of pressure. Please.
Caps, cuts, block grants = life sentence in institutions for innocent children/adults with disabilities. #NoCapsNoCuts #Nocaps #SaveMedicaid
22 million- my god! Astonishing, unthinkable
this CBO should kill this bill, if not look for another job
Dude wake up you are going to hurt a lot of people with this bill. You need to think country over party and vote no. 
If you want my vote, oppose #Medicaid caps, cuts, and block grants. People with disabilities matter! #NoCutsNoCaps #SaveMedicaid
Did & if u vote yes u will be considered incompetent or greedy.
U can save people from disaster & seat by voting NO
BCRA puts HCBS @ grave risk forcing children/adults with disabilities into costly institutions. That's wrong! #NoCapsNoCuts #SaveMedicaid
BCRA puts tax cuts on the backs of innocent children/adults with disabilities receiving HCBS via #Medicaid. Does not pass #KimmelTest
Voting NO, should not be a hard decision sir, put  American's lives above politics
As one of your constituents, please vote NO on this bill and protect your people
I hope you are voting NO to GOP healthcare bill Thursday! Basically what republicans are proposing is Murder! Killing the middle class!
How are you undecided?  This bill will be devasting for Louisiana.  You were elected to represent and protect us. Do your job! Vote No!
Mr Cassidy I urge you to vote no on this awful piece of legislation. This isn't a healthcare plan, it's a death sentence to thousands in #La
No "doctor" with any respect for themselves or humanity votes yes. Hiding behind a giant flag while voting to kill the poor is despicable.
just remember, CNN didn't elect you, Michael Moore didn't elect you, Hollywood either. Man up..
What say ye? NO NO NO!
If you pass this bill, don't call yourself a doctor ever again. A doctor saves lives, which completely the opposite of what this bill does.
liar liar pants on FIRE  #Trumpcare

Are you going to vote against Trumpcare? #SaveACA
This will negatively affect people I know, people with needs because of our poor economy. Please vote no.
Thank you for not blindly towing the party line, please fight for the American people!
really? has he declared his NO VOTE? nope! this is a dog & pony show before he votes yes. geez! he is WEAK!
15 mill more uninsured the first year under this bill. Yearly and lifetime caps on coverage. VOTE NO. This bill hurts your constituents.
Having pre-existing conditions, I fear losing coverage.  Devastating effects on disabled & special needs. #VoteNoAHCA
VOTE NO!!!! Can u hear us???
Another one sided CNN interview. Says Conway speaks for the GOP in order to justify his left leaning views.
DOCTOR Cassidy, first do no harm!!!!
so are you saying that will will not vote until you read and understand the bill? I don't think the Bloated Carrot wants you to read
"Kellyanne Conway is not the GOP." This was just said by your senator, Louisiana!!  
The risk pool is the whole point of insurance. Instead you are choosing to kill me and ruin my 18 year old's life. Without meds, she's done.
vote no please

It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery.
