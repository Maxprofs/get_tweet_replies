Working Americans would love to have the same tax payer funded healthcare our elected officials enjoy! Could've fixed ACA, chose not too!
AMEN! so does @BillCassidy really care?? Nope!  Can't wait for election time
2018 and 2020 are so important and if Kobach doesn't succeed in stealing the election we might have a shot at stopping the bleeding!
We the people voted to repeal replaced
Actually no. Nearly 3 million more voted not to.
Why does FNS always talk about who is going to pay for it. The question that is never asked is why are healthcare costs are so high.
I want everyone that has employer based insurance, which cuts you a deal/subsidy, to enjoy that money & enter the "free market"
You'll find that extra money won't begin to cover your new premium..but it's the argument you champion abt taxes and heathcare..embrace it
I want the power to make the insurance companies lower their prices and cover the care my doctor says i need..

Always bout making the rich richer!  Especially With MrT & The @GOP in charge
Look who's going to benefit by letting insurance companies sell sham policies that don't cover anything.
@FoxNews @BillCassidy who is the family?
Basic family is still the same we've just added to it
does this mean nuclear family?
Nuclear family that is new one what makes up one
what does this post mean by "family", do you mean immediate family?
The one thing about family is how humans have gone about destory what God setup one can see it's outcome today fragmented family unit
from beginning we've destroyed what was created. Only some see this and defend earth. 
Yes don't you think the one that made this earth & all that it contains will have the final say over what is done on this earth
Hey Bill. Give up insurance for you and your family, then tell us how empowered you feel.

Republicans are elected to care about our children they same way they care about their own children.  Even spiders care for their children.
Wealthcare DOES NOT POWER PEOPLE. Wealthcare empowers richest .06% thus lining YOUR POCKETS WITH $. Isn't that McConnels intent? STAND UP
The freedom to decide that dying is a good option because the family gets life insurance.
You have NO IDEA what ur constituents want. I call u repeatedly-no return call. I wait for townhall near me-none. U know what u want - GOP $
Bullshit
Yeah, sure Bill. Babies & cancer patients want to have the freedom to be denied care by a profit driven healthcare industry. #NoCutsNoCaps
We want to buy our own health insurance no penalties no government involvement
Really? Who makes decisions for family health? WOMEN. So why are ZERO women involved in drafting the bill?
I pay $8300yr for health ins. Wealthcare doubles that. U are pricing me out of health insurance, not empowering me.
You should do a whole show on healthcare costs, not govt health plans and insurance.
We do not want socialist medicine 
Get rid of Obamacare
One more thing Julia cost must B addressed the salaries of administrators, doctors, CEO, pharmacy are all overpaid,price list must be posted
AMEN
I totally agree with U, I also advocate doctors hospitals pharmacies  having a price list posted to the public so we can shop HC commodity !
Since u know what the people want, please release the numbers of calls to ur office w/ Y or N to Wealthcare, include letters & faxes #voteno

#BCRA Cut is Really a Cut: Senate Bill Will Slash Medicaid Spending across All Populations http://blog.aarp.org/2017/06/30/this-cut-is-really-a-cut-senate-bill-will-slash-medicaid-spending-across-all-populations/ … 
@ussenate @SinglePayer4USA Pay for your benefits. You'll get #AverageJoe benefits, no more you telling us, Power 4 citizens. @Morning_Joe
So stop your delay .
Repeal !! Now .
Let go back to health coverage before OBAMA care
Trumpcare gives a massive tax cut to the wealthy while making everything worse for all of us. http://www.rgj.com/story/opinion/voices/2017/06/29/healthcare-bill-really-tax-cut-sheldon-adelson-priscilla-maloney/437955001/ …
It is astonishing how speculation fuels fire and fear in people.
What about families of individuals with disabilities?
BIG gov bill puts the burden of medicaid/subsidies on backs of working middle class & sm businesses.For GOP to succeed,prices must come down
Best way 2 lower costs is buy in bulk, more buying power,330 mil ppl , big buying group
Its called. Universal healthcare
Agenda. PERIOD. It's what we voted for in November now GET IT DONE OR RESIGN
Care. Pass the damn bill so we can focus on Tax Reform, Building the wall, Defunding sanctuary cities, etc ... We want an America First
White House. Wtf is going on? Obamacares collapsing. Come next year every major provider will have pulled. My wife will be without Health
So where is it? You pyschopaths had nearly a decade to come up with a plan. We now have state Legislatures, the House, the Senate and the
And please let me know how you feel bout this when your penny less
I agree.  The family can choose the place of burial, cremation or poverty
And for those of you that don't have a family, Bill Cassidy will decide. . . . . . . Sorry, you just died.
Poster-child case of systemic State Govt trampling Constitutional rights of families with NO accountability
http://www.bostonbroadside.com/frontpage/daughters-charge-criminal-enterprise-within-the-mass-probate-family-court-system/ …
First thing that needs to be done is to remove the IRS from the medical profession
We need to rid ourselves of the republicans, and the POTUS. And we have to do it know.
Wrong, that is D end of democracy. Obama corrupted UR minds. SAD!
That would B D end of government & D return of D WILD WEST. Very sad!
Why didn't you set them straight abt 22 mil mostly being folks CHOOSING no coverage & that no one would be kicked off, change doesn't = loss
All Republicans would be more comfortable living in US 50 years ago, which is not ever going to happen.  The future is not the past.
Same like Trump & his family have currently.
REPEAL Obamacare !!! Then, REPLACE or let it IMPLODE !
Sloppy thinking!
Q: Are the choices people make when healthy and safe different from when they are sick/injured and facing death?
But for those who are not intelligent enough to make the best decision, republicans say GOD help them. Selfish is there way of life.
We have freedom. FakeFoxNewsMedia is trying to cast fear that we do not!
There's no power without money. What a load of crap.
For people to be really free to make choices, full-service healthcare has to be affordable for the working class. The rich are already free.
Don't 'auto-opt me' into anything. If I want it, I'll let YOU know. Get it?
Your sneaky, sleazy plan is unAmerican!
The Cassidy-Collins bill contains a dastardly automatic 'sign up' provision by the states. Hell 'NO'! If I want it, I'll let YOU know!!
This is Fox News so I assume this isn't a discussion about women's right to decide their own healthcare decisions.
People can’t buy what they can’t afford, even if they really want it. Why is this so hard to understand?
There is no #power no #choice for #American #poor #elderly #disabled #children #WeAreBetterThanThis #SaveACA or #Medicare4All
In 2016 71Million + on #Medicaid & CHIP; 1 of 2 Americans with a Job! Not being able to afford care NOT a choice but a #DeathSentence
You tweet is Obama's dreams!! ""The masses with Gov't health care and food assistance, no jobs, no money!""
What power? The power to have lifetime caps? To allow more employers not to offer insurance? To not be able to afford care? That's not power
That's the death plan!
do not believe with the governors say of Calif  New York etc they  are intelligence to handle health care.  pre conditions will disappear
I can't wait to choose between bankruptcy or death. So smart
That is the definition of #NoChoice! @GOP creating #deathPanels and hurting the most vulnerable among us
And the money to activate that power?  Where should that come from? Seriously..I'm listening. #ProtectOurCare #NoBCRA #SaveMedicaid
Then give them a. health care that is good for all.
At least lift the mandates!
The only way Americans can have a choice of any doctor or hospital is with SINGLE PAYER with PRIVATE PROVIDERS. #VoteNoBCRA
Trump's family? They seem in power already
I'm sick of hearing about 22mil & never the fraud, waste, abuse the other 305mil pay for. Give T19 back to states! At OLD rate & rules
GOP promised to repeal & lower premiums.Tell fellow Senators not to make promises that they can't keep.Thank you for tolerating my rants!
Trump is doing that already. Non elected Ivanka and Kushner reigning over more knowledgeable professionals in the WH and the cabinet.
Why is Medicaid not a separate entity? Set guidelines,restrictions based on budget & provide oversight to prevent abuse.
Then end ALL TAXATION and we will decide how to spend our own money, you twit!
Then the GOP should stop trying to use the Bible to make decisions for people
Repeal bill. 3 items to cover.
1.Preexisting covered
2.Kids covered till 26
http://3.Open  market across state lines.
Not hard.
Republican "power" is taken from middle class & low wage workers to give to the wealthiest.
Ok here is a crazy question.  How do we get the CBO to score your bill?  That will show the @POTUS your bill is a better start!!
The only gov involvement should be oversight of ins co ABUSE!Why r they allowed to make billions in profits?exclude pre-existing conditions?
Such a perfectly formed tested sentence.
To all you living check to check with no savings the word tested freedom won't heal you ACA does
How about freedom for women to make decisions for themselves regarding pregnancy.
Women have always had that.
Since 1973.
People want Trump to keep his promise for better, now affordable healthcare.
The American electoral college is stupid. I agree with Trump. It needs to be abolished and let THE PEOPLE DECIDE.
Your HC plan is BS Keeps taxes NO
@FoxNews @BillCassidy of the rich ones here with  political power now!
@FoxNews @BillCassidy common, we all hate racist white america! Not all whites here are bad but we definitely got to get rid
I guess you mean the power should be with the Russian oligarchs?
Question for you what freedoms do you feel do we not have & what decision has the government take over that the people did give
@FoxNews @BillCassidy America is a country of immigrants, everyone gets along with each other but we all have one thing in
@FoxNews @BillCassidy the main problem here in america!
@FoxNews @BillCassidy this would be a better country if we could get the racist white americans out of here! That would solve
I want the "freedom" to opt into a single payer system please. Why are you denying me that freedom?
Public Option - stop working for ins companies Fox.

@BillCassidy The power is meaningless if people can't afford what you're offering.
Med costs here are double that of the next most expensive country. Why not ban lobbyists and address costs?
Pharma spends billions each year on lobbying. Imagine if that was spent on drug discovery versus protecting the right to gouge Americans.
Access and affordability are two different things. I can access a Porsche doesn't mean I can afford it.
yep. witness the burst housing bubble years ago. example: part-time gym trainer w/o other income "owning" a $650k house.

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…

Center for American Progress has broken down the Senate bill's Medicaid losses for vets by state, based on the CBO: http://ampr.gs/2sjDZOO  
Freedom when it comes to health insurance means rich people have it and poor people don't. It's not freedom it's inequality.
That all changed when the Federal Government got into the charity business and then decided to trample on the rule of law $ add illegals
True We can't afford to insure the world
That is silly and we spend more for far less than other western countries. Why?
Senator Bill work with all the other senators to pass the health bill but not to take stand just to be on talk shows of CNN MSNBC etc
Nothing will change as long as profit is more important than people
We could go back to the old way of health care no doctors or hospitals. It find was to keep health care cost down
Then why is GOP giving ALL decision power that insurance companies? All congress and WH staff and Trump family divest insurance co. b4 vote
People don't really want more 'freedom'. People want the CARE... No one would be against FREE CARE FOR ALL, NO DEDUCTIBLE... IT CAN BE DONE.
So" let them eat cake"... How'd that work out?
Bill, have you EVER been self-insured? Power is NEVER w/ the family - only w/ insurance companies & the business model is to deny coverage.
So what's the difference in switching from an ins. co. and govt. ins. regarding denying coverage?
Family, motherland, same difference
Too bad almost nothing in his plan does that! #FNS
Chris why you talk over the congresswoman we she try to explain to you how the ACA were not being properly funded
