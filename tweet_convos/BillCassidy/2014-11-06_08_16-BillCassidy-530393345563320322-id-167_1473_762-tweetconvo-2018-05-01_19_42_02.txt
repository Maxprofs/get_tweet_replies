@BillCassidy REFUGEES??????? Really!!!!!!
@kcarr78 , please explain your "outrage" @ the use of a normal word, used in everyday speech. @BillCassidy
@Stammzilla had the faces of those seen on media been anything other than black faces, the term refugee would've never been associated.
@kcarr78 thank you for your enlightened commentary. Looks like we'll need to update our handbook.
@BillCassidy @instapundit good response
@BillCassidy @DEMAGOGSSUCK  She was probably over at The Capital Grille living it up & charging it to Taxpayers. Quit being Suckers, La.
@BillCassidy @Thatsalrighty Mary burn!!!
@BillCassidy
MT: Mary Landrieu wants to know where @BillCassidy was during Hurr Katrina? Setting up a surge hospital for refugees. http://money-archive.wp.alley.ws/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2005/11/01/8358877/index.htm …
Thats the way to do it @BillCassidy . Straight fwd facts. Dont let her mire you in her attempt at smears. Best wishes from Georgia.
.@BillCassidy thank you and please win.  The senate needs more people like you!
.@BillCassidy .@BassAckwardsUSA Well, Mary was very busy eating at the free shrimp buffet in DC. Poor thing survived without cocktail sauce.
Vote @billcassidy #LASEN
 I volunteered at the Katrina red cross shelter in gonzales for 3 months & never saw  @MaryLandrieu
@BillCassidy @IrishTea1 Where was she?
@BillCassidy @instapundit Landrieu is looking for ways to refinance that 2M mansion in DC--HARP could help
@BillCassidy while our darling Mary was safely in dc complaining about GW
@BillCassidy That Ol' Swamp sow gotta hate...
@BillCassidy I think that'd be a 'whoopsie' moment for #MaryLandrieu
@BillCassidy 

I guess @MaryLandrieu thought you were supposed to be calling @GeorgeWBush_43 a #Racist?

#WhereWasBill #Katrina #Hurricane
@BillCassidy @RobertLaurie so there Mary!
.@BillCassidy The question, Congressman, was where were you when Hurricane ISAAC devastated Louisiana? #WhereWasBill http://wherewasbill.com/disaster-survivors.html …
.@WhereWasBill Can you point to how the billions already appropriated for levees has been spent? Until La gets serious, I'd say no as well.
@BillCassidy @brandondarby @MaryLandrieu burn!
@BillCassidy PWNED! lol @MaryLandrieu wants to know where I was during Hurricane Katrina? Setting up a surge hospital for refugees.
@BillCassidy Victory is close!
@BillCassidy "Where Does Mary Live?"
@BillCassidy @TomFromLA Insert rim shot!
@BillCassidy @MaryLandrieu Open mouth, insert foot.
@BillCassidy the #Democrats haven't figured it out yet, you win elections on your own merits not by attacking the other person. #tcot
@B_radHilton @DocWashburn @BillCassidy I don't know. It worked quite well in 2008 and 2012.
@VanWagoner @DocWashburn @BillCassidy It did, but once the people realized they were lied to the tables turned.
She really walked into that one! Thank you for running. Keep campaigning! @BillCassidy
@BillCassidy 

Where was #Obama during the #2014 election & where is he now? 

Not in #Louisiana!

#2014Elections #Midterms2014 #runoff
@BillCassidy @JamesBSherk epic fail on her part.
@BillCassidy @drawandstrike: Let's ask her where she was during Katrina?  Bush called her days before to see if she needed help.
@BillCassidy This will backfire big time. Landrieu supported the failed policies of Democrats Ray Nagin, Kathleen Blanco & Aaron Broussard.
And that's when @BillCassidy showed @MaryLandrieu why it's a bad idea to ask
where a Louisiana MD was during Katrina.
@BillCassidy Thank you for not trying to sell out gun owners like Landrieu.

@BillCassidy Mary Landrieu doesn't appear to have missed any meals in Washington. She looks well fed, doesn't she ?
@BillCassidy @kerpen Maybe she should ask where Obama was during Benghazi, she might get somewhere.
@BillCassidy Mary Landrieu left Louisiana behind. I don't know anyone that voted for her. How in hell did she get into runoffs ?
@BillCassidy @PaulReverePress  Where was Mary Landrieu when she was trying to deny our gun rights by supporting the UN Small Arms Treaty ?
@BillCassidy Perfect!
@BillCassidy Surprise! Bet she wishes she could take this tweet back!
@BillCassidy @Judy_Taya and where was she? I'd be curious to know what she was doing at the time bc she was a senator then too???
@BillCassidy Da-OHHH!  Winning!
@BillCassidy Hope you win this run off. Time to put real leadrers in!
@BillCassidy she is done, should concede, she betrayed Louisiana for voting for ACA without reading it.
@BillCassidy @vmpcott Boom!
@BillCassidy @vmpcott She's politival toast and knows it.  An ally of Roy Nagin
@BillCassidy : She is not only ignorant of the facts, but she is out of touch with reality. She is washed up.  Dr. Bob Uda, San Marcos, CA
@BillCassidy @MaryLandrieu be like.....
@BillCassidy Sorry you're in a runoff, but reading your response made it so much fun to watch from GA. Bring it home :)
@BillCassidy @sweetakin Open mouth insert one racist, liberal, loser foot!  Great job Bill!  Take them out with the TRUTH!
@BillCassidy much like Barack Obama saying he didn't vote to authorize force in Iraq in 2002.
.@BillCassidy Someone on Landrieu’s research team just got slapped openly in front of her entire staff:
Mary Landrieu wants to know where I was during Hurricane Katrina? Setting up a surge hospital for refugees. #LASEN http://money-archive.wp.alley.ws/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2005/11/01/8358877/index.htm …
@BillCassidy @MaryLandrieu  that had to sting a big.
.@BillCassidy Not only that, sir, YOU weren't threatening to physically punch the then-President of the United States.  Landrieu DID.
@BillCassidy did Wendy Davis' consultants go to work for @MaryLandrieu ? #fail
@BillCassidy Landrieu was advising Blanco NOT to sign the Federal Disaster Order which set the recovery effort back 48 hours. Check Timeline
@BillCassidy #lasen @MaryLandrieu must be getting advice from @WendyDavisTexas on social media #failure #losers
@BillCassidy PS: RN working in Pharm Research, had Charity for a year pre-Katrina for a research site, love NOLA, thanks Doc.
@BillCassidy Here tweet is like a Daffy Duck cartoon where they are so bold and then step into a super deep pot-hole.
@BillCassidy Wow, she is really grasping at straws.
@BillCassidy @TheDavidMcGuire OOPS!
@BillCassidy @ConnieHair lucky for her house the flood waters didn't reach Virgina or DC
@BillCassidy @MaryLandrieu but you should have let the government coordinate it, look how well #FEMA responded
@BillCassidy You win twitter
@BillCassidy @TheDavidMcGuire Now...perhaps she will say where she was?
@BillCassidy @concreteczar she attacks because it's all she has left. She's a pathetic individual who shows herself to be undeserving.
@BillCassidy 
#WhereWasMary
@BillCassidy you racist misogynist, you!
@BillCassidy why are you referring to other Louisianians as refugees?
@BillCassidy why does this guy think I'm a refugee? @ChicoDelainky
Why does @BillCassidy consider New Orleanians refugees @marylandrieu are u and I from a different country?
@BillCassidy so we're still calling displaced New Orleanians refugees? SMMFH
@BillCassidy Remember, "never let the facts get in the way of a good story".  Arguing facts to a progressive is like teaching a pig to sing.
@BillCassidy A promo-video #TheEbola(Election)PerceptionPart2 for my new book #Absent2032.com watch @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HxARn_A_kI … …
@BillCassidy @AceofSpadesHQ To be fair. She just says whatever hey campaign staff tells her to say. Because. You know, she's an idiot.
@BillCassidy @KHShan well I hope she is treating that prun properly and a non ebola hospital  news if she will surrive till electiom day?
@BillCassidy @jjauthor She's flailing. She's terrified at the possibility that she may have to get a real job with measureable standards.
@BillCassidy @valsocal - BOOM!  You got her good, Doc!
@BillCassidy @karebair1 
Where was she ?
In her Mama's basement in D.C.
@BillCassidy @JumpyNelson Does Mary Landrieu even live in Louisiana these days??
@sessionsfan @BillCassidy In parents' basement. With free wireless & all!
@BillCassidy *4 YOU @Ron_3254 THIS IS ABOUT..THE DOC!!! THANKS 4 THE FAVE>You R On The BALL! HaHahaa;)
@BillCassidy *READ..WHAT THE DOC..DID! @ChristieC733 @WayneBogda @Braveheart_USA
@BillCassidy *Read This @ChristieC733 @Braveheart_USA @WayneBogda SHORT AND SWEEEET! Haha:)
@BillCassidy Keep up the excellent work, sir!  Youre going to represent Louisiana and this country very well!
@BillCassidy That makes sense, especially since Mary Landreiu was probably snug in her mansion in D.C. during hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
@BillCassidy @elliemae0404 By by Mary.
@JeanetteSchmitt @cliffdev51 @BillCassidy This is awesome. Mary stepped in it. @billCassidy smackdown http://twitchy.com/2014/11/07/stepped-right-into-that-propeller-sen-mary-landrieus-wherewasbill-tweet-backfires/?utm_source=autotweet&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=twitter …
@BillCassidy Someone should tell her that keg stands don't count unless the candidate actually does one.
@BillCassidy Oh snap!
Who the hell is driving the @MaryLandrieu clown car? You'd think she'd learn the answer before asking the question out loud. @BillCassidy
Ouch. That's gonna leave a mark. @BillCassidy @MaryLandrieu
@BillCassidy Brilliant response.  Thank you.  (many of us from other states did not know this)
@BillCassidy Congrats on your 250★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/530393345563320322 …
.@BillCassidy @Carolina_Girl3 Well, @MaryLandrieu did not know that, because she was at home in Washington, DC.
“@BillCassidy: Setting up a surge hospital for refugees.-Ouch now I have to follow you! Keep up the good work! Your still wanted up north
@BillCassidy If she actually lived in LA, she might know the answer to a question like that before she asks it.
.@BillCassidy #WherewasLandrieu when Obama Admin went after Little Sisters of the Poor & #ReligiousLiberty ? #Catholic 

(#WhereWasBill)
@BillCassidy Mary Mary Quite CONTRARY, how will YOUR VOTES grow, With a BRAIN FULL of DINGBELLS and NO MORALS, YOUR Senate seat is sure 2go!

@BillCassidy  OH SNAP!
So looks like the @WendyDavisTexas campaign is now running the @MaryLandrieu twitter account @BillCassidy
@BillCassidy I think you just owned @MaryLandrieu. Game, set, match!
@BillCassidy bill when ur opponent @MaryLandrieu is sticking her "dick" in the fan u never assist her in pulling th shreds out #MaryMustGO
@BillCassidy and other than aelf-promotion, what was she doing?
@BillCassidy self. Not the best typist.
More accurate tweet: @BillCassidy decides to respond to straw man instead of answering why he voted against Isaac $$. #WhereWasBill
Oops, that's gonna hurt in the morning... Related, while @BillCassidy was setting up hospitals, where exactly were you @MaryLandrieu?
@BillCassidy @utbeth73 during Katrina he was gone like every smart pers but after-setting up to help ppl
@BillCassidy Few words but all action. Landrieu might want to take note.
@BillCassidy #selfinflictedwound  Bwahahahah
@BillCassidy Love it!!  High five, Bill. 
@BillCassidy My compliments Dr.Cassidy.I know how difficult it must have been.I live in Dallas&we were helping a lot 2.Shameful Ms.Landrieu!
@BillCassidy @Shutterbugfun That might just seal the deal.
@BillCassidy AAaannnndddd ... That's gonna leave a mark.
@BillCassidy Refugees from New Orleans, if I remember correctly.  #tcot
@BillCassidy Nice move Mary.  But what would you expect from someone who voted for Obamacare while exempting herself.
@BillCassidy @YoungBLKRepub This mistake by Mary Landrieu is an instant classic!  Pure hilarity.
@BillCassidy @MaryLandrieu SHE HAS SOME NERVE!!!!!
@BillCassidy @TwitchyTeam You can't make this stuff up-it just gets worse for Landrieu
@BillCassidy @jtLOL So, um, yeah. That's one heck of a response right there!
@BillCassidy Landrieu keeps digging the hole deeper and doesn't know enough to stop digging. #thefive
@BillCassidy @1RonnieD Don't worry Cassidy, Louisiana have your back not that fat pig
@standby1933 @BillCassidy Look out for some truly dirty tactics, especially voter fraud!
@1RonnieD @BillCassidy I don't think so Ronnie, he will get the other 15% of the other republican that lost, this will be a slam dunk
@standby1933 @BillCassidy I'm hoping for it! She is deeply connected to some dirty dawgz though!!
@BillCassidy where was Mary? Jumping on the "trash George Bush" bandwagon while ignoring how much $$ LA received 4 Levee maint under Bush.
@BillCassidy where was Mary? Jumping on the "trash George Bush" bandwagon will forgetting how much $$ LA received for Levee maint under Bush
@BillCassidy *ABSOLUTELY BEEEEEEAUTIFUL DOC!!!:) GOD BLESS!!!:)
@BillCassidy Oh snap..
@BillCassidy and where was @SenLandrieu
@BillCassidy @raomaribeth Not good to ask a question if you don't already know the answer.
@BillCassidy @risinggem Where was Ms. Piggy Landrieu??
@raomaribeth @risinggem @BillCassidy down in the bayou honing her race card skills& keeping the "war on women"alive.
@raomaribeth @risinggem @BillCassidy And getting prepared for the beating she's gonna take in January I hope.
@BillCassidy @MitSnyder 
Louisiana, FIRE.DUMP, UN Elect--> Mary Landrieu
@a3auntie @BillCassidy @MitSnyder I hope they do
@BillCassidy @bzaz ms landrieu would not be a good trial attorney; better know the answer before you ask the question.Good luck, dr. Cassidy
@BillCassidy And where was Mary? Twitching her face on TV at a useless press conference with Blanco. Grace under pressure.
@bzaz @BillCassidy It's all projection. That is what Libs do best...
@BillCassidy @KarenDoe50 she should appreciate the fact that our citizen were in peril& her illegals needed your help also-in times of need
@BillCassidy @scleghorn2  Love it, keep going, you will win. I have confidence. Let's take our country back.
@BillCassidy #DefeatLandrieu
.@BillCassidy @BattleSwarmBlog Is she getting campaign advice from Wendy Davis?
@BillCassidy #WhereWasBill  setting up a surge hospital for refugees. #LASEN http://money-archive.wp.alley.ws/magazines/mone …
@BillCassidy @freddoso Maybe she made some phone calls.
@BillCassidy @AdaptToReality I did too. I set up beds & did triage in the Astrodome complex for the refugees who fled to Houston.
@BillCassidy Checkmate
@BillCassidy @JimmyPrinceton
great pic!  Maybe she can join him in prison for corruption @kris_kinder @BillCassidy @JimmyPrinceton
@BillCassidy @jackmcoldcuts I believe that is referred  to as an own goal

@BillCassidy:
