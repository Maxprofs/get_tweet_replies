This is a bold faced lie.  Graham-Cassidy strips protections for Elderly, Disabled and strips funding for Planned Parenthood.
This is a GOP bill, right? That alone proves that it is meant to screw each and every one of us Americans, cuz  GOP =GREED OVER PEOPLE.
Bill gets rid ind & employer mandates this makes everything else mute, ins companies will raise rates since less healthy ppl will buy in.
@LindseyGrahamSC this is taking $$ from blue states & giving to red states for votes/bribery/millions will lose coverage/fix ACA/stop this
You know they'll try it, if they can keep it under the radar.
Same old story, inept at their jobs so take from blue give to red - looks like blue should be calling the shots.
Giver states & taker states
And the takers are in charge.
Why can't blue states fight not to send money to fed govt or send less so they can offer citizens of blue states healthcare & protections?
The landlord's not going to cut the rent. There's groups pushing to get CalExit on the 2024 ballot.
Graham Cassidy prohibits states from setting up state ins plans/they hate healthcare 4 people/liars & scoundrels
Obamacare has improved lives in Louisiana. Cassidy and his newfound friends are starving it. The doctor is violating his Hippocratic oath.

LIE
This is a tax reform bill. They need to take the money out of Medicaid in order to give their wealthy donors another tax break.
Block grants, lifetime caps and higher premiums for the sick is not innovation. It's a death order for a child like mine.
@LindseyGrahamSC call your senators & reps/millions will lose coverage/this is dangerous for millions/fix ACA
It is only failing due to GOP deliberately sabotaging it
You are a base liar sir. If you were here, I'd slap you with my glove.

Don't have to be a math wiz to figure out how terrible this bill would be for CA. Graham-Cassidy would cost California $78 BILLION by 2026. 
States wont be properly funded. This is a disaster of a bill that will literally cause death. DEATH. Stop lying to the public.
Pass this alread and focus on what's really important ...putting @HillaryClinton on trial for just one of her many crimes. #doit #maga
Liar!! Liar!!!  Liar!! It is not failing. You jerks are sabotaging it and that new bill is crap
I think the entire GOP needs to be replaced with people who remember who they work for

FACT: HALF of California’s children stand to lose health benefits under #GrahamCassidy. #VoteNo #ProtectOurChildren #ProtectOurCare 
PLEASE GET THIS DONE! MILLONS NEED NEW HEALTH PLAN NOW
That must be why so many governors are against this shitty bill!
U r a liar! ACA is being sabotaged Trumpcare is an abomination Millions will lose coverage spending caps & reduced benefits to name a few
Wrong, Read the bill. Ocare has been self imploding for over 3 years! You will like this better!
1.Obamacare is not failing. 2. Have you ever had a real job? 3. Your official bio has numerous grammatical problems. 
No sir, you are failing. I believe it is time for you to retire.
Or go to prison.
I like it and have read it. I think its much more fair than O'Care for sure!
Rand Paul says it will increase Federal debt $1 trillion dollars, though!=BAD!
Bullshit.
Before Obamacare many States had thriving healthcare insurance exchanges.
McCarthy, you represent California - Not the @GOP.  Shame on you for selling us out.
BLA BLA BLA! All lies like all the other Republicans pushing this piece of crap bill. When people start dying, I hope you are happy.
Even health insurance companies disagree with @GOPLeader.
Because we all know that 50 individual states will serve Americans better than one standard plan.  Sad.
if it wasn't mandatory, how many people would drop their Obamacare plan?

You are a liar.  The ACA is working DESPITE @SecPriceMD NOT paying CSRs .  We know the #TRUTH #GrahamCassidy is a BAD BILL. #StopIt 
Thank you so much for your support for #GCHJ, a plan the GOP can be proud of to give needed relief to many.

Put a sock in it .@GOPLeader It is the same pig with different lipstick. Millions uninsured and pre-existing cond back.
Millionaire& Billionaire overlords must be screaming at trump, McConnell & Ryan to force through their tax cut scam (trumpcare).Blatant evil
No problem lets block grant your healthcare back to your state Why should taxpayers pay for your healthcare Let your state pay
BLOCK GRANTS NEVER WORK: they didn't work in the 90s and won't now:
I know Block grants do not work But Brady thinks they are fine for every one else His tax payer paid healthcare should be blocked granted

Because you want to kill it. Where it has worked is where it has gotten support. Blood is on your hands.
Stop lying!
Sen @BillCassidy called our reading of his health care bill on pre-existing conditions false. Here’s how we read it: http://n.pr/2fAWevD  https://twitter.com/BillCassidy/status/910316563047337984 …
Bullshit Kevin.

Back to that LIE NO ONE BOUGHT THE FIRST TIME MCCARTHY? Californians: WE MUST DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO RETIRE MCCARTHY FROM PUBLIC OFFICE.
HALF the cost.  If you Republicans CARED about citizens, you would copy others successful systems. It could SAVE OVER $ONE TRILLION A YEAR!
It does NOTHING to actually reduce US healthcare costs, OR to improve quality or access to care.  15 nations do it better @ 1/2 the cost!
You're clearly delusional and need to retire or you have no soul & don't care about the millions of Americans who will be hurt by this
Lies
Is this a repeal Bill.

Repeal Obama care ACA.

Why can't sen.rand Paul support this?

Repeal Obama care ACA. 

Thanks.
Obama's tax is the ACA, reverse the tax, repeal law, 
First step to real tax reform for Trump.
Oh you liar. As a newly diagnosed cancer patient, you are letting me die. Can't afford this. And you don't care, do you? Doesn't affect you

Any CA rep that votes for Graham-Cassidy should be voted out now.  This bill unfairly targets CA
NEW: Chart showing how state $ are "re-balanced" w/ Graham-Cassidy.

No apologies 2 states that improved coverage.

…
disgraceful!

You have failed us once again.
You are a LIAR LIAR LIAR
Obamacare is more popular than @Potus
LIARS! @GOP has done cvsryrhing to sabatoge it. You all have a special place in hell along w/ YOUR GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE! Pathetic liars
You think unaffordable premiums for cancer patients, pregnant women, autistic Americans, diabetics, etc. is a good thing? #disgusting
Your party crippled the ACA and now this, how do you sleep at night   Sad
It's not failing. Stop scaring people. #ACASavesLives
Your radical bill = most lethal attack on #EconomicFreedom hard-working Americans have faced. Bill is 4 ur funders
Liar. You will NEVER get reelected after Americans find themselves &their loved ones dying by the millions without insurance because of lies
Bullshit. It raises premiums and takes away health care. Quit sabotaging the ACA. #Liar #district23 #Fuh-Q
Rubio messed with it. You did nothing. Trump messed with it you did nothing. But its not really about Healthcare is it??
Shame. You could work on fixing it and making it better, instead you chose to score political points and take away health care. Shame.
A lie.
Screw doctor coverage when we could just use priests, amiright?!
BTW @GOPleader - get your resume ready.  I am going to be working really really hard to make sure this is your last term.

You won't find a clearer explanation of why the #GrahamCassidy bill is horrible than @jimmykimmel's monologue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=cOlibbx5sx0 …
This is a GOP lie! It isn't failing at all!

#GrahamCassidy is not a healthcare bill.  It's a @GOP campaign financing plan:
Gee, if you'd gotten off your high and mighty backside and worked to improve it instead of wasting 6 years trying to repeal it...
The ACA is not a failure in my house!  My pharmaceuticals wd be unattainable otherwise!  Work with your colleagues!  Fix it!  Don't dump it!
ACA is failing b/c of the Rep. Won't fund, it covers preexisting conditions, saved my sons life. stop the insanity.





Old enough to remember when @SenateGOP promised they wouldn't take health care away from a sick child. #GrahamCassidy https://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/909872706828386305 …

My letter to @BillCassidy explaining how his bill uniquely and disproportionally hurts his home state of Louisiana. 
Innovate?  Stabilize?  Please show examples, when cuts to Medicaid will surely NOT allow this.  Pls rethink
You only call it Obamacare because the GOP base despise @BarackObama was elected and rejected him as not legitimately president.
It is NOT failing. It s being sabotaged.

Top Louisiana health official rips Louisiana Republican: Your ObamaCare repeal bill hurts our state http://hill.cm/F2PMOFt  
Take net neutrality, take heath care , take away everything ! Then be happy !
Allows them to cut people off

Innovation is cool! My favorite recent innovation was when the ACA said I couldn't be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.
That's a LIE republicans regurgitate. Republicans have sabotaged payments to the Affordable care act since 2014. #SaveACA #SaveACA
@potus I wonder how much you're getting from rich lobbyists? That's the reason you don't care if people DIE without healthcare!
I don't know if you have the moral strength to vote NO on  latest bill to destroy healthcare for millions but I'm praying!
Obamacare is fine. Republicans are failing.
Federal contract employees under Obamacare know the truth. Politicians won't listen

We're already being screwed under the current Obama care program!  You have no idea how corrupt it is!

This plan is the worse than the last plan and that one was horrible. You greedy old white men have no shame and clearly no heart!
It is not failing. I have friends who are alive because of it. You are just another liar who wants to cull the herd.
If Obamacare is failing, it is because the GOP undermines it at every turn. Shame on you.
This is not true.
You are ignoring your oath of office if you support #GrahamCassidy 
MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY! 
Fix and fund #ACA
What about WeThePeople
VOTE NO!
Obamacare was designed well but GOP keeps causing chaos and chipping away at funding mechanisms.
No, ACA is not failing. That's a lie. You are trying to undermine it, then further harm your constituents, esp. children. Unconscionable.
No problem giving control back to states, as long as the FED sets clear minimum standards that cannot be watered down. ALL R EQUAL UNDER LAW
How about you do something to improve the options instead of continuing  to sabotage the #ACA and take care from millions of Americans.
Liar
BS it kills the poor and those with preconditions.
Shameless, you.
#SinglePayerNow 
@SenSanders can explain it so even you can understand it.
AND it's paid for:
LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...LIAR...
You mean empowers insurers to deny care, states to deny funding and GOP to deny any responsibility. GOP trifecta! You should be ashamed.
If ACA is failing it's cuz you're MAKING it fail! You're deplorable, all in the name of lining your and your donors' pockets.
#GOPisCriminal
Yeah but. #Obamacare is not failing. #GOPCongress is failing. Your poor constituents are being failed.
So if you want to empower states then why do you meddle with sanctuary cities. Leave the states alone.
Why does GOP overrule voters who voted for legal marijuana in some states. Do you pick & choose when to impose Fed rules? When states rule?
Fact is the ACA was working & premiums were going down. More work was needed but you'd rather kick ur voters to the street than improve ACA!
Yo McCarthy did you tell your voters that Trump is sabotaging the ACA by w/holding money owed to states?  I know they're gullible.
Wow such a small tweet.  Would have expected more robust explanation of why this bill is better from someone sponsoring it?  Hiding?

This is false. There is no guarantee of reauthorization and this Congess has no power To bind that Congress. This bill is a cruel disaster https://twitter.com/billcassidy/status/909128430997901314 …
No it does NOT ! Even more stringent cuts in essentail healthcare under G-Cassidy, no useful flexibility.
GOP is nasty and cruel. Babies with birth defects not protected for pre-existing conditions unless parents rich!
It's failing only because you & fellow GOPers are making it fail.
Empowers them to do nothing except take away health care from those who need it most. U are either to dumb, mean or both. GOP death squad.
STOP LYING
Coward.  Let it be scored.
CBO scores showing tens of millions of Americans will lose insurance coverage has helped derail past repeal votes. R solution: vote w/o #s
Kevin is the fat kid who got chosen last in school.  He couldn't tell good from bad
#GrahamCassidy is a bad bill that and a disaster for California. GOP needs to start working with Dems to fix ACA.
AARP stands ready to work with Congress on commonsense, bipartisan solutions to improve health care.

#GrahamCassidy is not that bill.
This is a lie.
Is there any reason to preserve the totally unaccountable health insurance risk arbitrage business model? @AmerMedicalAssn @JohnsHopkinsSPH
Lies lies lies
Obamacare isn't failing. It needs to be fixed. The GOP proves, once again, they are cretins that can't govern.
Obamacare is not failing, but you are trying to sabotage it. Improve it, don't repeal it.
Well Kevin that's actually a Lie by the way
It's another Godawful GOP plan.  The people have clearly said fix the #ACA. You're not listening.
Lie. And lie.

#GrahamCassidy #SaveACA #SaveMedicaid #ProtectOurCare
If you want to keep promoting this lie, u will be defeted in 2018. Don't underestimate your conserv district. Ryan is on the ropes in WI.
this kind of public policy would *encourage* abortions of disabled babies
ACA would be fine if you just fixed it and stopped sabotaging it. VOTE NO on Graham/Cassidy. It's cruel and inhumane. Universal Health Care!
States DON'T INNOVATE NOR STABILIZE. #SaveACA
McCarthy hates that Americans have health care & perpetuates the lies to work to hurt and kill Americans for GOP entertainment.
This isn't a Fix! Red States will not fund this, you're simply delegating the cruelty of reduced coverage to the State.
That would have happened if all of the states would have agreed to participate in the exchanges with all insurers. #Medicare4All
No it doesn't. It takes money away from the states by 2027. Get the eff out of here with this trash proposal. I hope you get voted out!
That's a lie
How will you live w/yourself if #GrahamCassidy passes & many of the most vulnerable die w/out affordable access to decent hlthcare #SaveACA

This from May 6 is an infuriating artifact: both Cassidy and Graham criticizing House for EXACT thing they are doing https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/06/does-it-pass-the-jimmy-kimmel-test-asks-senator-who-authored-proposal-to-replace-obamacare/?utm_term=.a71d3db5362e …
No it's not. And this Proposal rips healthcare out of Americans hands.
You're a disaster Kevin you know this isn't true. You're a failure and a fake and we will not re-elect you!
B.S. ACA gave tens of millions insurance. GCHJ takes it away, raises premiums, kills pre-ex conditions. PURE EVIL.
Obamacare is such a scam, I would rather go to the veterinarian. There would be more humanity than The Doctor Grubers we have now.
Kevin, you misspelled LIAR! Your handle should be corrected to @GOPLiar. In no way do you show signs of leadership.
#fakenews #performanceartist

Hey @LindseyGrahamSC How could you listen to my concerns for my child's life & then propose a #healthcarebill that could kill her? 
Rep. McCarthy: As a fellow Californian, you know better. Our state took Medicaid expansion. Others chose not to. How is GCHJ equalization?
#ACA is not failing. #CassidyGraham will leave 10s of millions uninsured, just like all the other versions of TrumpCare. #ProtectOurCare.
You are a lying liar and the whole country knows you are willing to sell out every American for your rich friends and $ from ins lobbyists.
BS. He's lying.
This is a lie.
Nope! And shame on you!
Get help.  Mama didn't intend on raising an antiChristian sadist.
No, no.
As your fellow GOPer, Joe Wilson, once said - YOU LIE!
Liar.
#ACA is not failing, you are a liar.
#GrahamCassidy will throw millions off insurance.  That is your innovation?  You are the one failing.
You're a liar. #GrahamCassidy will result in no care for tens of millions. You should be ashamed of yourself and your party. #voteNO
Like setting a trap to make someone fall. You just can't figure out how to make it work. Fix it not scrap it
