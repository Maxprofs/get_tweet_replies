Everyone is smiling.  They will have healthcare.  We won't.  Hilarious!
You wrote that repeal only was the wrong course. Stick to your word. No repeal and delay!
Repeal without replace is NOT a humane option!! Please work to fix what's wrong with ACA. Don't vote to take healthcare away from millions!
Please protect rural hospitals and Medicaid. The working poor deserve access to healthcare  A constituent in Cenla.
CALL CASSIDY NOW! Tell him #VoteNO We must  his phone lines! LA suffered cuz Jindal denied us Medicaid exp. No going back. 202-224-5824
As an MD, you already know what this would  to my nursing-home-bound family member in 70420. Don't turn your back on LA families. #VoteNO

The CBO just scored the latest Senate repeal bill.

17,000,000 Americans will lose coverage by NEXT YEAR.…
So wrong u JOIN @realDonaldTrump on his EMPTY statements+lack of moral/values, that only intend to try to help up his POLLS, not AMERICANS!
NOT TRUE that Dems won't work with you! IF REPAL taken OFF table, they will be pleased to do so!It is RIDICULOUS that you won't FIX ACA!
Opioid funding? Does big pharma have some culpability for the epidemic?? They made big $ on it, shouldn't they step up?
Please fix ACA. You are a doctor. You understand the importance of it. Don't let Louisiana down. Represent us, not party.
SHouldn't be difficult for GOP to JOIN DEMs and FIX ACA! 68% of VOTERS want JUST THAT, whatever @realDonaldTrump threats you with!VOTE NO!
When it comes to cost control of healthcare, why isnt anything being asked of heaith Insu comp and big pharma?? They are powerful huh?

We want universal healthcare. There is not one good argument for why we don't have it. Greed and profiteering. Healthcare before profits.

Senator Cassidy, please vote yes to repeal the ACA without a replacement plan.  Congress should take more time to get it right.
Try discussing HC with your constituents instead.
Vote and start the discussion!  This lays on the shoulders of the GOP!!  Congress obviously does not stand for WeThePeople! #GOP
You said ObamaCare is failing from original design, with no GOP action. Not true. Rubio blocked Risk Corridors. GOP states refused Medicaid!
UR Despicable All Mouth! Y don't U tell the Entire Population of The USA abt how Doctors get Rich?About the Bonus System,About Patient Care?

1/ I haven’t tweeted much about healthcare because it’s a painful subject for me. But it’s important, so let me tell you my story 
Take heart. Trump's new slogan:
Instead of tv, u need to have a town hall w/ the people u represent. Who's that u ask? ... taxpayers of Louisiana who are paying u to do tv
U Of ALL Ppl have NO Business on camera talking about ANYTHING,Much less LOUISIANA!Home of the Worse Healthcare&the Highest Murder Rate EVER

Veterans are speaking out against the Senate #Trumpcare bill which might hurt 1.75 million #veterans and their families #ProtectOurCare 
from a constituent (me): let's celebrate the advances of ACA and work hard together to improve it
Make healthcare first party purchase
Good interview. You are on the right track. There is a way out of this morass. Keep at it!
You made yourself look like you didn't have a backbone. Why are you even a Senator if you're just going to follow?
Do you ever vote without someone telling you what to vote for? If you Believe something is bad for your state Why would you vote for it?
Block grants do not work! Stop the LYING! You never asked to work w/anyone! We see through your BS  You have no right being a Dr.
Protect citizens of La!  Don't cave to 45's ego.  Cross the aisle!  Don't repeal only.
Please don't support repeal only. Don't give into the pressure. It doesn't have legs! Just say NO. Thanks George Bain zip 70435 covington
Thank you.
Liar! Millions will die. Civil unrest or civil war is coming. @GOP you caused this insanity with your complicity #Unfit  #WeAreComing

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…

.@SenatorCollins to @ThisWeekABC: GOP health care bill "would make sweeping and deep cuts in the Medicaid program." http://abcn.ws/2tfyJkR  
Louisianna has had it tough and many people suffer.   Why would you want to hurt any of them more.  Where is your humanity.
If you don't understand the importance of the individual mandate, then you will never figure this out.
"We're not that far apart." What planet do you live on? This is why your party is failing. How are those trump coat tails working for you?
As your constituent I would hope you don't support any bill that would take away our healthcare. We need a real plan that works for all.
One size from the feds will Never fit all. Bring #Healthcare back home where it belongs: patient-doctor decisions, minimal state regulation.
Why can't Republicans decide whether they can figure out healthcare or not? You look foolish and absolutely like you can't figure it out.

Why does the GOP want to take 30+ million Americans' healthcare away to fund $800+ billion in tax cuts for the rich?
Another tv show. Please quit ur job & go into tv. You clearly like it.We know u support GOP$, not us.Do u actually work at the Senate? Ever?
