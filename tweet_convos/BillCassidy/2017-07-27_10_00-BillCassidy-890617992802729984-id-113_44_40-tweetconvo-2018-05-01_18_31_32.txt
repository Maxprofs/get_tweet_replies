Time to be a badass like Butch Cassidy and vote no on the #skinnyrepeal
Get rid of mandates at minimum or small and mid size business close and no one can buy any insurance, much less the 20million indigents
Do you understand!! NO TIME left, or don't come home!
Can't get you on phone busy signal, hope you understand we can't wait for O'Care to fail. PLEASE!!!
Get a clue. Mandates are what make the ACA work. If a business can't support decent wages and insurance for their employees, see ya.
Please vote NO on this irresponsible "skinny repeal"! We need you to be a patriot and stand up for America 
It is unworkable, poorly thought out and won't fix the system

Senators say they don't want House members to pass skinny repeal. House members say they would totally pass skinny repeal.
So where is the amendment written down? Can we read it? Does it protect kids in SC? Does it protect anyone? #KeepKidsCovered
You know that your caucus is going to laugh at it, right? The sooner you figure out your party can't govern, the better for the nation.
Senators, stop this charade. Will you choose people, or politics? Please vote no on #SkinnyRepeal. #SaveOurCare
They chose. They're "yes" votes. Supposedly, McConnell has his 50.
The good news is that info was wrong!!!!! 
You are a fraud and danger to all the people of Louisiana.
Is it that important to see your name on a bill? If so, find one that saves lives. That's what doctors do. #FirstDoNoHarm
very upset about this. Not the way to go. Keep your promises!
Vote no! Stop playing political games with peoples lives.
Your governor is against this bill knowing what it will do to hurt people. Do the right thing, work on a better bill while ACA is in place.
here's @CenterOnBudget analysis:
@SenDeanHeller is a Republican RINO Traitor. Your President, Your Party, and your constituents will never support you again.
YAY! Great compatriots all! NEAUX GEAUX without guarantees for BI-PARTISAN process- American Public deserves thoughtful deliberation.

Graham, Johnson, Cassidy & McCain want "assurance" skinny bill will go to conference. Here's why that's worthless. http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/skinny-repeal-mark-meadows-senate-house … 

You are spineless and all talk.  I can't believe I defended you to people.  "He's a doctor, he DOES care".  What a joke.
Do your job, pass the damn skinny repeal.  Get the ball rolling!!!
What r u doing 2 advance Pres Trumps agenda. You don't need to act so high & mighty. You don't have voters in mind
I spend more time deliberating on a pair of shoes than you've spent on this amendment. And shoes are returnable.
Proud to have @SenDeanHeller join me and @LindseyGrahamSC as a cosponsor of the Graham-Cassidy Amendment. "Graham-Cassidy-Heller"
You are shameful human beings, enjoying your 100% taxpayer-paid full coverage health insurance
YOU act like you're so smart. Whats the problem with healthcare? All repubs lied in 2016. You are probably going to pay.
Good work. Vote for the "Skinny Bill," but only as a stepping stone to passing something more attractive.
I guess i will have two wait 4.5 year to vote no for you.
What happened to passing the "Kimmel Test" Sellout. #trumpcarekills


It's hot and we're angry! #killthebill @BillCassidy! History is watching! 
Amendment to what? We haven't even seen A BILL yet. What the f*** is the GOP doing over there? You need to get serious! #TrumpcareKills #La
It's a garbage amendment.
Is is a symbollic signing?
Did Heller confirm that Adelson is okay with it?
#CleanRepeal it's what we were promised.
Yea woot woot TY 4 another Dem seat
Well...what is it?
-Moe, Larry & Curly write an amendment...heaven help us
Oh, Lord! Not another misguided "Health Care" bill? Amendment to what?
"would get rid of requirement that individuals must have insurance  coverage and employers have to offer insurance to full-time employees"
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/14/sens-lindsey-graham-and-bill-cassidy-have-alternate-heath-care-plan-heres-how-works/480548001/ …  can I refuse police, fire and car insurance too? except when I need it, of course
Tell @SenDeanHeller not to get too comfortable. We Dems will defeat him in 2018.
Could we get a diagram of this hot mess of a Frankensteined health care bill the Senate is stapling & stitching together?
"Proud", eh?  

Bold choice of words. High probability that you're gonna regret the f*ck outta this tweet next year, if this thing passes. 
Produce it so we can all see what you mooks have to say about healthcare. This is utterly ridiculous and disgusting.
How can any one of you be proud of this?
@rking_19 @SenDeanHeller @LindseyGrahamSC Say goodbye to your Senate seat in '18, Heller.
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare #BCRA #AHCA #MedicareForAll #SinglePayer #Medicaid
Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
Please take away health care from the nasty poor people !!  Rich white men rule ! 
No bill passes by one party is the solution . Need bipartisanship - Healthcare should not be a one party issue- millions of lives at stake.
Where's the amendment?  If you are proud of it, share it.
But you're still likely to vote yes on whatever the party does, so these other things won't matter if you're yes on bad final bill.
Are you proud of 22 Million Americans losing their healthcare?
I believe in you Dr Cassidy!
NO!!!!! You're IGNORING your constituents and that little thing MATH!
Well hell I guess if Heller is going down he's going down bigly!  #DoYourJob #PeopleOverParty #CountryOverParty
How about repealing Obamacare you hack
So, with this amendment, how many more people will have health insurance that don't right now?
“Graham-Cassidy-Heller” sounds like what I’d yell if I dropped something heavy on my foot
Proud to have @SenDeanHeller join me and @LindseyGrahamSC as a cosponsor of the Graham-Cassidy Amendment. "Graham-Cassidy-Heller"
Please get rid of Obamacare and start over!
Not good. I do not support Cassidy. He doesn't represent Louisiana well.
I disagree.  I think he represents is well. I believe he is a good man who knows how to recognize good ideas! Good man!
A lot of folks are calling this the best of the worst of all of the these proposals.  Does that bother you at all?
What does the amendment entail? A little information would help
So proud that you won't tell us what's in the amendment or talk about the backroom deals McConnell used to buy your vote.
what does the amendment do?
What kind of backroom deal did you cut this time? How many people will die or go bankrupt so you can give Adelson & Wynn tax breaks?
Breaking: #GOP Death Panelists figure out way to help their constituents while killing the rest of the country to give rich a tax break
Not proud enough to tell any of us about it...proudish?
Insurers are warning of premium hikes and Americans losing coverage under skinny scheme. You will own this:
BREAKING: Insurers slam skinny repeal, which will lead to "higher premiums, fewer choices for consumers, and fewer people covered next year" 
Any text?
@BillCassidy You CANNOT be proud of this process! Of no hearings, committees, @SenateFloor order. 
If it's good, please work #Bipartisan
Bill text? CBO score? Committee markup? Make all of that public or shut it.
How and when will this be raised?
It preserves all the tax increases. Shame on you all.
Is it now considered bipartisan reaching across the aisle to create a bill with just republicans?
Awesome! Let's send the bill over for hearings and scoring. Save the Senate and do this the way the founders intended.
Fraud! @jimmykimmel
So what does it say? Is it just a GIF of @jimmykimmel giving a thumbs up? #SaveACA #SkinnyRepeal
Why can't you work with Dems and improve ACA? Stop this partisan bull !
Remember when you went on Jimmy Kimmel's show and pretended to care about babies born with pre-existing conditions? #ThursdayThoughts
Dean Heller is sponsorsing a proposal to phase out Medicaid expansion in less than 3 years?  #Promisebreaker #voteno
@stephgracela @SenDeanHeller @LindseyGrahamSC Great - between the three of you, do you think someone could write it down?
Which says what, exactly?
too bad Mitch the Turtle won't even look at it  well (cont) http://tl.gd/nnvrji 
#Shameful! Call 844-432-0833 and tell him to vote NO!!!
Fine, where is the text of this amendment? Can we read it? Does it have a CBO score?
Where's the public hearings?
Where's the public release of amendment?
Why ALL the #Secrecy ?
Where's your legislative text? CBO score? How can you vote in few hours w/o EITHER? Do u have votes? Otherwise we r stuck w skinny repeal!
