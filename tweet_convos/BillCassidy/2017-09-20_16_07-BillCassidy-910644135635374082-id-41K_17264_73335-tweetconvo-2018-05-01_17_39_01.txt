Lie.
A worse lie than "you can keep your doctor"
Your lie leaves people with NO doctor.
Mr. President, please study the bill carefully. Be sure it offers "better coverage at a fraction of the cost," as you promised your voters.
I doubt he's studied it at all. I think would pass anything now just to be done w/it.
Sadly, you're probably right. I keep thinking people can change. Sigh...

Do you even bother to read bills prior to lying about what is in them? Many of us are literate & actually READ every word for ourselves.

IT'S COMPLICATED  DUH
You. Are. A. LIAR.
Can you read? It allows states to discriminate against folks w/pre-existing conditions. You're a poseur pretending to understand anything
Why is the richest country on earth so greedy not to consider healthcare a right?
You didn't read Don. How do you know? You didn't read the bill or even pat of it
0% chance he read the bill.  It's likely he was half listening to his briefing of the bill.
Me every time you tweet a lie (which is pretty much always).
Liar Liar Pants on Fire. You are just repeating what they told you about it. Not what you read yourself.
It writes out protections for pre-existing conditions elsewhere in the bill. You really should read the bill before promoting it! #NotGreat!
Graham-Cassidy is NOT A GREAT BILL.
This is not true. You will sign anything that undoes @BarackObama policies/accomplishments no matter who it hurts. Stop the deceitful Tweets
It does not!
Thank you Sir. 
And the ability to purchase across State lines?

Liar.
This is a lie.  But if it's so great, why are you offering the Alaskan Senator that her state can keep ACA if she votes for yours?  Ironic?
If that were true then why are the #Medicaid directors of all 50 states against this bill? Including these experts.
#GrahamCassidy targets people with disabilities in every state. It is not a great bill for people with disabilities. #DisabilityRights
but you see POTUS Trump, mccain is one-upping you again to show that his pen is mightier than yours; retire this bum for medical reasons now
YES MCCAIN US 1 UP N POTUS. BUT MCCAIN IS HIS 1 HEAD UP N HIS AS ,
you know what, that could explain the bulge in mccain's cheek!
You haven’t even read it!
At what cost? Not $12 annually! Could you just resign or die? Either is acceptable 
#DotardTrump

Coverage of pre-existing conditions does no good if it's unaffordable. #GrahamCassidy would allow states to jack up rates

Call 202-224-3121 https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/910641701064204288 …
Be honest, you haven't even read it yet.
When #GrahamCassidyBill supporters say those with pre-existing conditions will be covered, technically, they are correct. #BodyBagCoverage
This. Is. A. Lie.
 Even insurance companies acknowledge it is a lie. This new bill is the latest attack on Americans healthcare. #savetheACA
It will literally mean the difference between life and death for both my wife and I. Of course you know that as you are lying
FAKE NEWS from the buffoon that "never thought health care was so difficult". #TrumpLies #TrumpStupidity
Hey #DotardTrump , I have the option to buy an island too but if I can't afford it it's not really an option now is it? #FixACA
Trumpster you will not sign the Bill "if you read it"......what it says and what it allows are 2 major differences!!

Trump lies every time he speaks. A worse liar than Nixon. Far worse.
Just another McCain and Graham gotcha moment Mr. President. You didn't actually believe they had good intentions did you?
Democrat judist McCain
You have absolutely no idea what it does or does not do.
Give him hell froggy!
States can get waivers to base premiums on health status--insurers will charge unaffordable premiums for pre-existing conditions. #Moron
@realDonaldTrump  Throwing Americans to the dogs over healthcare. MAGA!!
THERE IS A GIANT LOOP HOLE THST LETS STATES OPTOUT!!! and all the states where insurance companies  the politicians will use that

@BillCassidy you stated:
- only 4 states
- Provision...IF state applies for waiver
- "I THINK the price will be lower"

…
I believe you believe that...but I also believe they're lying to you...it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions because of the state waivers
If it's so great, the "wonderful" group that proposed it needs to use that insurance coverage (including you).  #didntthinkso
You are getting the job done for all Americans Mr. President! We salute you and thank God for you!
is this an opposite day tweet?
No-it does not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. You actually think USA citizens are stupid - don't you?? #downwithGrahamCassidy
But it does NOT prohibit States from charging huge $ increase in premiums for any pre-existing conditions-amounts to same thing-no coverage!
All you do is LIE! Can't wait for Impeachment! You don't care about anyone but yourself. We'll soon #RepealandReplaceTrump #RobertMueller
Have you even read it? Can you read? What planet are you from? Do you even hear the crap you spew? This towering turd bill is inhumane.
I'd like to repeal and replace you. You're an embarrassment to the office, to the country, and quite frankly to humanity as a whole.
Again, how can you not know it doesn't cover Pre-existing conditions? Your base is going to be PISSED and your ratings will fall further.
Why believe U? You lie on every single topic. 
You've lied continually on healthcare. Why should this be a different?  Desperate for a win.
You have no fucking idea what's in that bill. You know you didn't get past reading the name of it. You're not equity at all
So, you lie daily and we are suppose to believe this particular one???  Absolutely Not! Not my Healthcare!
I'm sure you have no idea what's in it.
The Senate GOP better not blow this opportunity!
You lie.
What makes us think he read the bill? He can’t even read the word Namibia!!
Graham-Cassidy destroys Medicaid,increases insurance premiums 5times higher,take away essential services requirements, prescription coverage
It does NOT!! Are you lying or just clueless? It will bankrupt millions then kill them. WTF is wrong with you?!
You're vile and shameful. #impeachTrumpnow
.@realDonaldTrump it's too bad that I think my @POTUS is so uninformed that he may not even know how big a lie he (YOU) is telling. SAD!
Fucking liar. #PutinsPuppet

Sounds like something a shady used car dealer would say.
Does it cover,  "pants on fire"? Because you are smoking.
This bill puts an expiration date on healthcare access for millions of ppl. And you lied about it on @jimmykimmel last night...Unbelievable.
federal govmt give large amts to states for health is a way for the states to have fun money.  States can't print money, but the Feds can!
Obviously you haven't read the bill! States can wave those rights.
It doesn't.  People who can read, know what's in the bill.  You do not.  Just a bunch of double talk from LIAR Cassidy.
If you truly want to make a difference require any health care bill you sign to require it to also apply to Congress health care
What about the cut to Medicaid.  It is vital for those that are disabled, low income that have 2 subsidize their Medicare w. Medicaid.
@BillCassidy "You got caught with your GO-PENIS Out! " Jimmy goes after Lying Sen. Cassidy & it was fucking fabulous!
Not that you read anything, but it doesn't.
When you're so racist & jealous of the former brilliant @POTUS44 you're prepared to make 32m patriots  suffer .. #GrahamCassidy #Sad&Lonely
LIAR
Sorry Real Donald, another lie by you.  It doesn't protect pre existing conditions.  Why do you lie ALL THE TIME ?
Good
No it doesn't #LIAR #COWARD
You have NO IDEA WHAT it includes. That's obvious.

Pakistan zindabad you scariest face in the world
I don't think Trump can read the bill, I'm sure it's over a third grade reading level
You are a #LIAR
Since i doubt if you can read more than a dew simple paragraphs Comrade Trump how do you even know what rhw bill says?
Why must you continue to lie to citizens?
You'd sign anything at this point just so you could say you actually passed something. Yo haven't read it and can't begin to understand it.
No it doesn't. Unlike your minions - not all Americans are idiots.
LIE!!!This bill allow ins. co to charge whatever they want to for pre-existing conditions. If we can't afford it, it doesn't exist!!!
I'm all for Repeal & Replace. Repeal any laws shielding you & your family from prosecution, & and replace you with a human president.
It's not gonna happen. Your presidency has accomplished nothing. Unless you want to count empowering white supremacy. #resist #impeach
...except the state can allow premium hike for pre-existing conditions.  Can't afford it, no coverage. G-C fails.
Doctors say that pathological liars eventually turn orange.
LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE! #factsmatter
Trump Just Tweeted A Very Dangerous Lie About The Senate’s New Trumpcare Bill
You are delusional, seriously ill informed, or a liar. Maybe all three. Sad.
You are a liar. Your excuse for your lies when you are caught is ignorance of the law. Your words mean nothing, you have 0 credibility.
BREAKING: Trump will not sign #GrahamCassidy as soon as he finds out it doesn't protect pre-existing conditions. (Jk, he doesn't give a )
Incredibly misleading: under G-C, providers will charge exorbitant premiums for PEC, pricing those who need it most out--that's not coverage
A great Bill:
I again ask what is your definition of lying? Because you're doing it again. States decide to allow insurance companies to cover/charge
It is certain that you have not only not read #GrahamCassidy but haven't read any of the equally atrocious GOP #Wealthcare bills that failed
How would you know. You never read anything before you sign it.
Except it does NOT include coverage of pre-existing conditions. Gave you even read the bill?
Remember, HIS vows can be trusted!
Liar
You don't read and haven't read the bill. It's horrible.
@LindseyGrahamSC Stand by me & THE PEOPLE. @SenJohnMcCain No, I vote AGAINST THE PEOPLE to suffer ACA while I enjoy BETTER CARE. Sad legacy!
Nonsense
Sadly, Wapo not where I go for information. Believe they backed 44s claim: "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor - Period.
Put both houses on Obamacare if it's good enough for us it's good enough for them! NO Exemptions!
No it didn't-If you had bother to read the bill you would know this. This would have pushed 32M off health care rolls. How is that American?
Love you Mr. President... You are doing a fine job...
Hopefully Trump will have a heart attack and have no health coverage, it would be 'such' a 'shame'
Fire tom price
It does not you pathological liar
But, you don't read so how would you know?
Giant flipcharts with pretty pictures are just to
keep you happy till your morning poop is done.
You're such a liar!!!
Still No legislation!!! Youre A #BumBitch!!!
And no you’ll never sign it.
I doubt you ever read it. Have you ever tried not lying for an entire day just to see how it feels? Try it you might like it.
I voted for u never again ur sick
Repeal and Replace !! Drain the Swamp
FYI you break it YOU OWN IT!
#plasterSaint
have U read the bill?
many republicans haven't read the bill.
there have been no open committees discussing the bill details.
UR a #failure
#LiarLiar
Lie
Bill allows insurance companies to price based on risk.  Premiums will be based on expected cost of care.  What will a cancer patient pay?
You lie, like always

https://twitter.com/mfpcrules/status/910355504983166976 … save Biafrans from Nigerian army now.@realDonaldTrump @netanyahu @PutinRF_Eng @PutinRF @Plaid_Abe @Plaid_Australia
You capitalize your nouns like your favorite author: Hitler.  Do you still keep a copy of Mein Kampf in your bedroom?
STOP  LYING  TO  THE  AMERICAN  PEOPLE  This is not a joke, it's your JOB. Do it or get out.
Why not actually read it and all fine print before blasting out you blatant lies?  #muellertime #DotardDon
Liar!
I, like many others, NEED this to pass! I havent had coverage since Ocare was passed! @SenJohnMcCain has HIS coverage so he dont care!
You're the literal monster of Americas dreams. I really hope you remember that on your impeachment day.
With every breath you take - you are the biggest mistake! SMH Lying #DonTheCon
and we are all pawns in ur game. You'd sign a bill to put 32+ million at risk as long as u got a 'win' no matter the hurt!
It does NOT require pre-existing coverage. You just tweeted your ignorance! Dumbelievable!
Can we Repeal & Replace you? I mean, before 2020? Asking for a nation. #DonnieDotard
Lies from a lying liar
Bullshit. Try reading the bill. It will depend on what state you live in. God help us all!
It doesn't. I know they told you that but it gives the power to the states. No good.
Well there you go lying again. I  think you have a problem w/ telling the truth. A good psychiatrist could help.#ImpeachTrump #TrumpInsane
GREAT BILL LIKE YOUR TAX REFORM FOR THE TOP 1% , MIDDLE CLASS & POOR PAY YOUR FREIGHT? SCREW US ONCE, TRY AGAIN, & UP YOURS
Then why did Traitor McCain vote against it? Open his sealed file. There's truth there. Please, this is need to know.
Thanks I'm enjoying your great work and true statesmanship you go Mr President we love you and your family
Me. President! Why didn't you remove them from receiving OCare exemptions? Why? @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @FLOTUS @PressSec @CLewandowski_
You can remove my reply ,but I am a constituent of your government also if my opinion differs from yours please enlighten me .
Well carry through and put Congress on ACA now that they're giving McCain the pleasure of shooting it down again @realDonaldTrump
As long as we're not "Replaced". #LockThemUp
Absolutely wrong.  Trumpcare always known as death care. No Health care for 25 millions
Wake Up @POTUS @IvankaTrump THIS WILL NEVER WORK. MANY HOSPITALS WILL CLOSE FROM BANKRUPTCY! #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #GrahamCassidyBill
Rumor has it that it neither Repeals nor Replaces!
It does not so you shouldn't.
maybe u should get some1 else to read the bill for u.  as whoever is reading it to u now isnt doing a good job...
More like Choke and Puke! #ImpeachDonaldTrump #NotMyPresident
Coverage available at premiums average people cannot afford is not coverage. It's a big, fat lie.
You really expect us to believe you? Or expect us to believe you've read it? #idiotinchief
You're willing to sign any health bill that comes across your desk from the GOP without even reading it! What's wrong with you? You suck!
Liar liar pants on fire. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I was going to say and you know it, but maybe you don't. You're not very bright, are you?
.....
One, #TrumpCare would not protect preexisting conditions, another of your lies. Two, #TrumpCareDead!
BALONEY! You don't even know what the bill says!! Read the small print, buddy! You CAN read, can't you?
No it doesn't, it gives the states the ability to essentially bail on pre-existing conditions #smokescreen
#mentiroso
U juz luuuve ACA. But ya hate Obama-care! He he he!!!
Trump you lie so much that am tried. We the people hate you. Resign and allow us to once again enjoy living in the USA.
I am done with this so called Republican Congress. Repeal Obamacare...100% or go down in history for laying the platform for socialism.
What about the corporate tax breaks hidden in the bill???? Is that being transparent??  Sneaky!!! It includes coverage but at what price.???
Another lie.
LIAR!
You don't have a fu€king clue what is in this bill. You never have.  You just want your tax break for yourself funded.

The con man is getting conned
Donald trump will sign any thing, you don't know what is in the bill but you still will sign it. Millions will be hurt.
Lie about pre-existing injuries. TrumpCare -even children with cancer could not  be saved. Would you do this to Barron?
Hey trump did u ever ask Paul Ryan for his resignation?  u promised to do that to!
Soulless man.
Don't fall 4 that crap America yes pre-existing conditions are protected for people who could afford excessive premiums a policy U can't use
Repeal.  Replace.
