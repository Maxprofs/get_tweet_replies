Sycophancy which knows no bounds.
If they don't do something about healthcare then there are many lives at stake. Let's get this thing moving!!!!
Your bill is mean and hurts people. Stop trying to get a bill out of desperation. #PeoplenotPolitics. If you have buy votes ,got a bad bill
This is the swamp that needs to be drained!  God help our country, and this earth, with 'leaders' like this.
#FailingAmericaGreatlyAgain
Great to hear!
Your DeathCare bill failed again.
#Liar #FakeChristian

Amen! They choose viagra over a woman's healthcare.  Maybe they can circle jerk themselves while killing Americans!
Women are free to choose what ever they wish. They have plenty of healthcare if the chose to use it .
You sir are an ignorant fool.
Please don't repeal Obamacare !
@VP & @LindseyGrahamSC  you call yourselves Christians? hmmm...I thinking God may say differently. Here's to judgement day
Gonna end usury?
When they are under indictment what will you do? When the countries in turmoil you've lost your last friend tell your family Hillary did it?
You and Trump  are  purposely sabotaging  the  AHCA in order for his bill to get passed.
Your sick creeps
Please stop lying.  Single payer is NOT socialized healthcare and you know it.  Is Canada a socialist country?
Or Great Britain or Japan or Germany or any other of dozens of 1st world countries that have healthcare for all their citizens @GOP = liars!
Yes and the ones that can afford it come to US for HC. Age limits and waiting lists  for surgery VA is single payer ask a Vet how that works
No system is perfect but a system for all is better than nothing for many. All countries have to continually work to improve what they have.

I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. http://bit.ly/2xtEuvz  
A win at any cost & the cost is people
It's clear GOP is happy to play politics w/lives. GOP cares more about erasing Obama legacy than duty/responsibility. #VoteNOGrahamCassidy
And Koch brother money!'
Comparatively speaking, the Kochs are the good guys these days.
How do you figure? They own our politicians who are ignoring their constituents wishes, undermining Democracy daily.
May Bill,Lindsey&anyone voting not to fix the ACA have their families be inflicted w/long term catastrophic illnesses of their constituents

Obamacare is failing because of GOP backdoor deals with @mtbert to trade ACA market collapse for anti-competitive mergers. https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/910569501921443840 …
You are another disgusting coward! May the harm you visit on the people of this country be repaid to you and your loved ones a hundred-fold.
You are Pushing a bill that will devastate families if even one child is hospitalized.  THAT's what you call successful?

Dude you're not the president. Why are you being saluted?
https://www.facebook.com/rpatino2/posts/10103042584238752 …
By all means, rush back so u can stick it to us.

Liars. Just let them pass it. They think they've seen disaster; wait till the people stand against them. They've been warned. #Vote2018
Sexist, bigoted & homophobic @VP @mike_pence is ordering the execution of millions of US citizens via his murderous healthcare bill sham.
YOU WON'T WIN! And who the hell would listen to you anyway. You are a liar just like your boss!
If Sen Graham is sure that several Democrats will hard put not to vote for #GrahamCassidy, why is Sep 30 a deadline? AFRAID OF CBO! Retweet!
Sept 30 is the deadline because after that date, they cannot use reconciliation (50 votes). They would need to work together and get to 60.
Exactly! If they expect 10 democrats to vote with them, why not do it after all the facts are there!


1 There is no replace in this only destroy. What will be left is what we had before the ACA. Sick ppl who can't get treated...
2/ Insurance companies charging whatever they want then reusing coverage to ppl who've paid their premiums faithfully...
3/ workers terrified of losing their jobs b/c it'll mean losing the meager benefits they have.  Taxes and premiums going up. But...
4/4 at least your rich donars will get their tax breaks and state governors and legs will be able to use Medicaid $ any way they see fit...
5/5 which for most of them will be putting money into their own pockets. This is a mean, corrupt, and useless bill, and you know it.
The CBO? Hah! Here's what they RUSHED together on DEMAND. It's NOT complete. In fact, it's changed from 23 million to 50 million in 1 day.
I hope that Robert Mueller takes you and every other lying Trump lapdog down and hard. #RussiaGate
You just keep on dreamin @tmas61.  Mueller has nothing.  It's been over a year.  Zero evidence.  You'd have a better chance going after HRC!
Your profile pic Disney castle seems apt for someone living in a fantasy land
Not me bud.  You should visit.  You're in a dream world.  Wake up and snap out of it!
Bring in Rand Paul.  We deserve better than 2nd place.
You guys would love to kill people over the age of 60
And you did it. You support these lies.  SHAME ON YOU!  Your mother would be ashamed of you.  I am.
Vice President Mushroom has spoken.
Trump keeps him in the dark and feeds him bullshit.
You all are horrible!!  Educated person here who love's the ACA and President Obama and is disgusted with Trump and his minions!!!

Jimmy Kimmel: Sen. Cassidy "either doesn’t understand his own bill or he lied to me" https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/21/16344070/jimmy-kimmel-health-care-graham-cassidy-response?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter …

So that you could spread more lies about this bill? My daughter will literally not be able to stay alive if this bill goes through.
President Trump & VP Pence have been fighting hard to rid the nation of disastrous ObamaCare. We now need @gop to get a bill to POTUS!
One question, if you have health insurance, is it through the ACA?
Are you referring to disastrous ObamaCare that was so bad the Obama ppl said the stupidity of democrat voters is why it passed?
you mean that terrible DISASTEROUS ACA that even republican voters want to keep?   keep on truckin.  stop lying.
Which Republicans wanted to keep disastrous ObamaCare?
democrats got voted out at all levels of government over the last several years-
And it's going to get worse for them & they know it
lol.  take away their healthcare.. see what happens.  you Repuke dinks will be out on your ear before you know it.
Please repeal and replace. For every 1 person obomacare helps it hurts 2.  1,400 per mo premium, 9,000 deductible and I can't afford Dr apts
Let’s just do this half assed like everything else y’all do and just repeal it!!!!!!!)))
Replace #Obamacare w #Statecare

Let States decide what is best for those living in the individual states.
Wrong 
You are no #Christian when you fight for rich #elites to get more tax cuts, and the neediest among us to get service and support cuts.
When you give tax breaks to businesses, they have more money to hire businesses. When you push the minimum wage, you kill Jobs.
But my point still holds - a Christian government takes care of needy first, like Christ said.
GOP govt is one of greed like Ayn Rand said.
And that’s what Churches/Organizations are for.
That's what the "christian nation" Pence wants. You can't have it both ways- Christian govt on abortion, etc. non-christian on poor.
Well you are entitled to your opinion. Have a good night
Thanks. You, too.
POTUS will sign ANYTHING just to get it passed!  Sad.
32 Million Cast Adrift.

Sick.
You tired yet?
Healthcare as a profit center is awful. Stop doing this behind closed doors. Be careful of backing Trump. It is going to be bad.
Yeah. Who cares about freedom. Lets destroy democracy to force everyone to get the same healthcare and pay for it, rather you can afford it
I have no respect for anyone associated with @GOP. Since you are eager for a nuclear war, maybe it does not matter.  I despise you.
You are giving yourself anxiety, wrinkles, and headaches for nothing.
Nice bot.  Go away.  How is Moscow?
You sir, are cruel to the helpless, sick, and poor Americans.
Hopefully GOP heroes that stopped other attempts to deny access to care will stop this bad bill.  Americans want bipartisan solution.
Does he have pictures of you with the young boys?
.@SenJohnMcCain @SenToomey @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @PressSec @WhiteHouse @
you are clueless
Good luck 
Awww!  Who's a good boy?  Who's a good boy?
Let the American people vote if they want change... show Dems they're wrong w how they think
No you heard him wrong.  He told you to go jump off a cliff.
Who was the top?
And give death sentences to Americans. #CassidyGraham
Boy, that Picture will be great later- When they charge you with the felony of Obstruction of Justice-
@VP, I think @potus just wanted you to hold his little, tiny pee pee, because his tiny little hands can't quite hold it.
With our evil 'socialistic' healthcare, live on average three yrs. longer than the average American which, costing half of HC costs.
Healthier, happier, more trusted and smarter. ROCKS.
Not to EXPLAIN WHY U USED CHARITY MONEY TO UPDATE UR HOME U THIEF??
You sare me more than Trump your a snake in the grass
Looooosers


JUST RELEASED: 32 million to lose coverage under Graham-Cassidy ACA repeal.

http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/blog/2017/sep/potential-effects-of-graham-cassidy …
Because Jesus told you putting our seniors on the street to die and letting premature infants die was the "Christian" thing to do?
Your such a spineless sorry excuse for a "Christian"
seeing you salute is almost as disgusting as the emperor
lol is there anything written on that paper ?
Great idea! Thanks for your service!
I hope you guys all rot in hell. 
The #FailingTrumpAdministration is a total joke!!!  Trump and the entire LYING @GOP are totally incompetent!
Liar. Bought by Koch 
Is mother coming with you?
And yet, you proudly proclaim you're a Christian? You're a lying, fraud who chooses party over country. 

Perhaps read your Bible once?
Why are you trying to kill the poor, disabled, elderly and redistribute $ to the wealthy? GREED
@BillCassidy @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC

@VP If the @GOP passes #GrahamCassidy you all best be prepared to be unemployed in your next bid.
Did he also command you to heel, sit or fetch?
#EmptySuit #TheIdiotVeep
This is a sham bill and you know it. It has no upside to patients and would allow those with pre existing conditions to be pillaged. Shame.
PLEASE VETO - Vote No #GrahamCassidy bill. 
@GOP
@realDonaldTrump 
@POTUS 
#ProtectOurCare 
Do Not Pass #GrahamCassidyBill
Wasting time is good for the Democrats.....thank you. I hope the lunch was tasty, because that is about all you're going to get out of this.
PUPPET PENCE will do anything he's told. He has no problem taking away healthcare from millions of Americans. Pence has his
Pence the vile evil fake Christian works hard against America in service to Russia. Cassidy also works against America.

A bill -- finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate -- should be viewed with caution.
Two shit heads riding in a plane and acting like they are doing something good. Really sad.

Isn't the VP under indictment yet? He and Manafort were very close. Both are traitors. #russia #impeachpence
On tune and it's off key
Great !

All you want is the rich to get richer and the poor to die
What a good lil lap dog.... your husband must be proud...
You claim to worship god, but have no issue murdering millions of them. Hell awaits all of you.
Hurry! You've got old people and poor people to hurt!
Unbelievable how cruel you all are. May you feel the pain you are inflicting upon the American people. Truly dark period in America.
Why do you want to kill off Americans? This is the worst version of Trumpcare yet. I thought you were "Pro-life". #ACASavesLives
Is the bill called Kochcare since they bought and pd for it? Didn't know they had such a puppet collection.
There is nothing more cowardly than taking from the sick & the poor to give to the rich. They don't care about people. #GrahamCassidyBill
MAGA
@LindseyGrahamSC You both should be ashamed about this. What are you doing in this manner that you’re doing is hateful. No bipartisanship
Please talk to Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson he is a business man who has a plan.Listen to him he has the right idea...
I bet you did that's your style screw Americans as hard as you can as fast as you can!
Why do u trust Graham?  He's a traitor to POTUS.
Shame on you! You are heartless and corrupt! Stop calling yourself a Christian
Not good for Louisiana.
the American people are ALL hoping you will fail.
Lindsey Graham need to be replace
Just stop. We went through this all summer and all you have are bad, unworkable ideas that the majority of Americans hate.
They don't care about majority of Americans. They care about their rich benefactors.
They believe the Trump/GOP/Fox lie that helping the rich & hurting the poor will help the working class. Still waiting 4 trickle down.
Death Panelists for #Trumpcare NO TO #GrahamCassidy @GOP = #EvilLosers
you both
FDA NEEDS FUNDING TO STOP COUNTERFITS, AND PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT ALLOW CHEAP DRUGS TO REPLACE QUALITY !
Thank you, our best VP ever.
What's the CBO score? I hope none of you ever need the govt funded healthcare you receive...seems ALL Americans deserve what congress has
You mean to help hurt 1,750,000 veterans and 32 million other Americans.

Well you and the child are two peas in a pod. Socialism? Seriously? Get a grip. I can't wait to take back Congress! We despise you people.
Wasting your time Mike.  These guys will not support the Pres.  They will be voted out!!!
Before taking healthcare from millions Americans, you know voters, you all should give up your FREE HEALTH insurance first.
@BillCassidy @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC
If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
people will die #GrahamCassidyNO
POTUS asked me to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, I said AHHhhhHH. SPLAT!!!!!
We don't want to see McCain's boy friend either. Graham u are as big a traitor to the US public as Tramp
Stop trying to defund Planned Parenthood
Yeah Lindsey I'm from Indiana & I know that the vice President doesn't give a damn about anybody who's not a straight white $ Christian male
You show no compassion for people,  just like the authors and supporters of this ruthless, heartless, despicable bill.
I can't wait to repeal and replace you. Your healthcare bill is deplorable.
You are such an awful person @VP and @LindseyGrahamSC! Why do hate American Citizens?Why?
Pence. God is watching you.  He will judge you.
This is most shameful act--88% of Americans hate the GOP bill. This is not about health but about midterm elections. Disgraceful politicians
@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenCapito @SenJohnMcCain The most important vote of your entire life will be coming up soon. Pls vote NO!Thx



How was your salad, Senator Graham? I'm tossing mine thinking about what you call "progress" 
The rest of the civilized world looks down upon us because the rich in America profit on the calamitous health of its fellow citixens.
First it's not called Obamacare it is the Affordable Healthcare Act. There are parts that need adjusted just call in experts to fix it.

Would you put your own families on a #healthcare plan like the one you're proposing? http://deirdreryanphotography.com/i-am-a-pre-exi … #weareprexisting
Does POTUS ask you to kiss his butt, too?  Or doesn't he have to ask?

You and this whole administration need to be #repealedandreplaced #motherslittlefreak
