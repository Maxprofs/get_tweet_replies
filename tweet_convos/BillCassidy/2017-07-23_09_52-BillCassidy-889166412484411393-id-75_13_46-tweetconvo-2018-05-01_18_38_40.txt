Talking healthcare w/ governors on call organized by @LindseyGrahamSC & @BillCassidy - it's vital we listen & heed advice of our governors
Our current governor actually cares about La, but the last one ruined much in our state. HC shouldn't be political. #UHC
Our current governor just made major cuts to mental health.
Fact: LA is poor. Fact: Med expansion is reimbursed by fed govt at 95% under ACA. Fact ACA helps LA. And jobs.
But I do agree health care shouldn't be political. Also mental HC is just as important as physical HC and they should be treated equally.
Yes! Mental & dental should be part of the complete package of whole body proactive Healthcare.
It is a difficult problem. The problem is with Medicaid numbers growing all the time, Where does the money come from? You raise taxes again.
No. We cut out the politicians and insurance companies. We get better results for less money #UHC #singlepayer
Speaking of governing closely when was the last time you held a town hall? In NOLA? In the Lower 9? In the 7/9th wards? the East? Gentilly?
You said Senate would not vote on AHCA. You said you would keep preEx http://protection.How  could you?
The vote is on a motion to proceed to the House-passed AHCA bill. If the substitute isn't out before then, that's what they're voting on.
Shame on you. A no vote now will give you an opportunity to work with the Senate, all of them, to fix problems. Not make new ones.
Where is the doc who founded a clinic to help the uninsured get access to free healthcare in 1998? What happened to that Bill Cassidy?
In the States that accepted Medicaid expansion and did not have GOP sabotage it, the rates have been quite stable.
Then what do we need you for?
Cost of health care was once very affordable and private before insurance companies n govt got involved.Found a $ can be made off the ill
Insurance companies have been around for a century. It's not health ins companies, its big pharma. They were started to help people.
Health insurance started out as wage supplement for missed work due to illness. Its no resemblance to what we see todsy
Yeh, a hundred + years ago. It got this way many years after, but it's been this way a long time! It's medical costs, not insurance!
And it wasn't an 100 years ago
It actually was longer than "an" hundred.
"Returning power," indeed. You know this is the death knell for healthcare in America! PLEASE vote no on Obamacare repeal.
And the governors even republicans are against  repeal and replace
The failure is 100% yours, & your GOP colleague's. You PROVED you aren't capable of doing the job you're getting paid for.
We've done a lot better in WA than most states because the DEMS got on board the #ACA & worked FOR US. Imagine if every state had done that?
FACT: #Obamacare is only 'exploding' in red states where @GOP governors have successfully sabotaged the program http://fw.to/ajtmW6i  #ACA
he means returning costs back to the states.  I wonder what our governor thinks about it?
@LouisianaGov
Do not vote yes on the health care bill. You are tossing your constituents under a bus for party. Americans before party.
But you haven't listened to the voices of your constituents who are fearful of the bill that will be voted on tomorrow.
Please vote against either of the current repeal bills. Both are bad bills that don't improve healthcare. We need a bipartisan solution.
Listen to the wisdom of Sen. Durenberger, sir.

Senators, listen to pediatricians: “It is impossible to cut Medicaid without hurting children.” #KeepKidsCovered 
Vote NO on repeal! Fix ACA! People can't afford premiums or ded. on either plan. Just fix it!
You have had hearings for MONTHS with Dems& have a BIPARTISAN bill on FLOOD ins. Why not same for HEALTH ins? Hypocrisy, no? #KeepUsCovered
Lousianians - don't let Trumpcare hurt you and your friends, family and neighbors.
Sure. Ask Kansans how that all worked out under @govsambrownback.
None of the people wanting to keep all or part the #ACA voted for you and they never will. #CleanRepeal @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy
What statement have you made against this, Sen. Cassidy?
How about listening to patients. Why is our health your political football
join the movement for good governance
Your not a Governor nor are you likely to retain your seat if you don't get behind my President!  Soo many like me, get ready
Nope. Many many more are like me...Trumps approval rating is pitiful.
I thought your health care bill was Collins-Cassidy? No?
If you vote MTP & GOP rushes joke bill thru, you will go back on babies like Billy!
Billy is 3 months old & doing great. Thx for the love & support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got 
Which means you're willing to make healthcare a crap shoot for millions of Americans.
Bill - this is a #baitandswitch isn't going to work friend because #healthcare is #ultimately #federal
Totally agree, Senator.  Here's an article that ran several weeks ago.  http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Health-Care/2017/06/27/Levine-Let-states-decide-on-health-care …
It more important to listen to the people who elected you.  #CleanRepeal @SenJohnKennedy @realDonaldTrump @RepMarkMeadows
Then listen/speak to LA disability advocates #Medicaid cuts/caps & preexisting condition waiver hurt most vulnerable #DoNoHarm #SaveMedicaid
Edwards doesn't like it. Then again, you don't seem to care about Louisiana
Will Cassidy need McCain's advice and listen to Gov Bel Edwards and oppose the Republican plan to damage Medicare? Don't bet the rent
You failed the @jimmykimmel test, you invented. People won't ever forget that, especially when millions of Children are tossed off Medicaid.
You were elected to enhance the lives of those in Louisiana.  Listen to us.
Well Gov. Edwards is against the repeal and replace plan and against the repeal and replace later plan. I take it you will then vote no.
Lots of Talk - lets see action.
What happened to Cassidy Collins?

Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
Then why not pay attention to your constituents about healthcare legislation, Senator?
I think he has. Maybe your not paying attention.
"your"? My what? Did you leave out something?
You can pick apart the grammar all you like, it is twitter. I think you got the point!
Not really. I find the use of "your" for "you're" quite distracting.
Listen to @LouisianaGov. #SaveMedicaid
A cowardly way to say u support the appeal of ACA. On one of ur TV appearances u weren't even sure what u are voting on. #voteno
Most @GOP govs want to maintain #SaveMedicaid expansion #fixitdontnixit #FixRiskCorridors
Our state is corrupt and backassward

Sen. Murkowski committed “I will not support a reckless repeal process that leaves people hanging.”
That’s what Senate GOP plan would do. 

"I'm begging, Senator Heller" - This woman is battling stage 4 cancer and Trumpcare at the same time 

Health care bill would  premiums & take coverage from thousands of West Virginians. RT to tell @SenCapito: #VoteNo 

CALL: (202) 224-3121

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair.

Schumer doubles down on his earlier calls for a bipartisan health care plan 
 

I worked w/ Pres Obama to roll back part of Obamacare that was harming vets & now I hope Dems will to the same. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3oKgKEAIDw&feature=youtu.be …
