A Republican on Fox News. What's next? A vote on a healthcare bill without a CBO score? SHAME!
Because you know you can't defend it against real journalists, you hide under the skirts of propagandists. #Traitor #KochWhore
So you're going to tackle such tough philosophical questions as, "should everyone have access to healthcare", and "are Nazis bad"? Good luck
Oh that should be challenging, Fox News...real hard ball stuff there.
Nobody is interested in listening to your crap!

The outright purchasing of votes. Everyone involved in this moral and intellectual monstrosity should be ashamed of themselves. https://twitter.com/jenhab/status/910921385924493312 …
I'm sure u r a very good and decent person but PLEASE, stop sending these horrible people to DC. Or let us help u to stop the madness.
Hey Senator, Your wife is running a GOVERNMENT FUNDED charter school that got an "F" rating. http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_e583b4f2-bbe1-11e6-8add-e30dc63ccb46.html …
How did yr wife's academy get a $1 million "mortgage" when it doesn't own any property? Payoff?
Classic bait & switch Your wife's proposal for Louisiana Key Academy extolled the benefits of being located on the LSU campus.
Here's her Dept of Ed proposal in case it slipped your mind. http://www.coweninstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Louisiana-Key-Academy-Baton-Rouge-p1-100.pdf …
Instead of a site on the LSU campus, your wife opted for a building in a run down shopping center & spent $1.5 million to renovate.
Here's the thing, senator. I can't figure out who actually owns the building at 3172 Government Street, Baton Rouge. http://lakeyacademy.com/content.cfm?id=1405 …
Not familiar with East Baton Rouge property records database. Does this record indicate the academy owns the property?
Twitter isn't really the venue for detailed reports but here's what I found. Catholic High School  ...
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE JUST FLEW OUT THE DOOR WITH TAX BILL. MAY AS WELL JUST GO WITH THE DEMS.

you're despicable
More like Slim ball

Your name is on a bill that 80% of Americans oppose. When did you decide to sell your soul?
Lies. trump care does not protect pre-existing conditions.
Cassidy and Graham are LIARS,  should be fired.  I do not care about 
Their repulsive DONORS.    Let donors pay their salar.
y
No it doesn't. OIt gives states permission to charge more for  pre-exit conditions,

Great...another opportunity go on TV and LIE to the American people. #BillCassidyIsALiar
While you go on Fox tell lies abt your bill, glad FL BlueCrossBlueShield has started sending emails w/key info for open enrollment ACA.
Trump governmnt actively boycotting the law of the land, has cut open enrollment time BY HALF and is threatening not 2 pay the subsidies.
GOP is a shame, Trump is a shame. You want to take our HC to give tax cuts for your campaign donors.  Only fools can believe you. #SaveACA

Why don't "We the people" repeal your healthcare. U could then sign up for your own plan 

Cassidy....Lie, Cheat, Steal to reverse signature hc bill implemented by a black man. 1-6th of econ. Americans HC.....and the fucker lies.



The cruelty of #GrahamCassidy is almost too much to comprehend. https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/909920752157253634 …
Senator, you should surrender your mandate to represent real people. You are trying to hand Trump a legislative victory he craves. Resign.

Seriously. This is BANANAS. 

You couldn't get ALL 50 state Medicaid directors to agree any anything else in health care policy. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/911036343664484352 …
@BillCassidy will be running in 2018, lets tell him how much we aprecate him trying to take healthcare away from millions by voting him out!
Genocide. Look up the definition. How do you sleep at night as a physician.
Finally got through your phone line. Said I'm your constituent & want #MedicareForAll. Scrap your bill & replace it with that.
You're about to get your sorry mean spirited hateful ass kicked #grahamcassidy
You are an embarrassment to the medical field and the human race!!
Horrible
AMA NEEDS TO PULL YOUR MEDICAL LICENSE FOR BREAKING YOUR HIPPOCRATIC OATH WITH REGARD TO YOUR SHIT NON-HEALTHCARE BILL.
Shame on you! Millions of people would die from this bill and you don't even care! This isn't like rooting for sports. These are lives.
So, after this abomination known as #grahamcassidy fails miserably, will you resurrect your stellar dancin' career?

SUCK ON THAT BILL
To lie some more? How much money did the Koch brothers promise to give you? I can not believe that a doctor who took an oath to heal people


Bill Cassidy, you are an embarrassment for our state. Who is paying you off.
Bill, you there? Hello, hello?
There’s a place in hell for you
Shame on you
Dear Bill Cassidy, please leave the country we fought and died for, and stop trying to victimize our people—signed Forefathers
More lies from Louisiana; the state where white supremacist David Duke still gets ~60,000 Republican votes for Senator in 2016.  Disgraceful

Check their ratings against Jimmy Kimmel, an honest man.
Fake news fake bill. Make sense.
MORE LIES FROM THE REPUG MAFIA! TOUTING THE DEATH BILL!!!
Oh shocker going to fox news were they kiss your Bum tell what's it like to have no soul how do you sleep at night
you want the GOP to keep their word to kill the elderly poor sick young. you all lie the ACA is keeping them alive and you hate blacks
The world waits to see what next issue will receive that special Bill Cassidy finesse.
Show her this.

It's FRAUD - @SenJohnMcCain took donations on the premise that he would end Obama Care.

You know @realdonaldtrump hasn't read this bill..have you?? It's a legitimate? since you are using trumps support as "proof" #BillCassidy
LMAO..you cited trump's support as PROOF your HC bill is a good one? That is a farcical as one can get. Shameful!!  #GrahamCassidyBill
In your safe space so you can propagate more lies. You don't even know what's in the bill. @SenJohnMcCain is a hero.
Listen to John McCain. “I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried.”
@LindseyGrahamSC - you don't understand your own healthcare bill.  But we do.  It's to pay your donors - nothing to do with healthcare.
Mccain true colors:
John McCain Is Not Happy With His Republican Colleague Over FBI Letter https://trib.al/h5mkFEN  
SORRY LIAR
Senate Republicans should listen and return to the bipartisan process that was already underway in the HELP Committee. #NoGrahamCassidy
Why dont your donations add up 
Bill ?
The FEC wants to know why Sen. Cassidy's disclosures don't add up. http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/013/201709210300093013/201709210300093013.pdf … 
Bill Cassidy may be the last person to know Trump is a liar with no credibility, especially when it comes to policy.
Cassidy cites Trump tweet as proof his bill protects people with preexisting conditions https://goo.gl/MfiHNT  

I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. http://bit.ly/2xtEuvz  

No no no no. The choice was between finishing bipartisan health care talks or ramming this dumpster fire through. Nobody said "do nothing." https://twitter.com/billcassidy/status/910957022304198656 …
here you go you are going to need this to wipe your tears this is not going to pass now do your dam job and work together for america
Fantastic. U & McCallum can cynically deceive us all that the bill helps the vulnerable, &sick, and tell us it had a chance to pass won't u?

NEW: Nonpartisan Brookings estimates 21 million lose coverage by 2026, 32 million by 2027. This is the best estimate absent a CBO score. 
Hahahahaha!!! Your bill is dead for this go around. Hold your head in shame you liar!
You’re an aweg human being and I hope you get voted out.
For trying to kill millions, you will go down in history as a villain.  You deserve it.
Heyyyyyyy, Bill. You speak to @SenJohnMcCain at all today? 
Now is the time to expel John Traitor Hateful McCain.
Who is running against @BillCassidy and where can I send the check?
God Bless Senator McCain!
The bill will not work. Just repeal ACA like you said you would when campaigning!!!
#CassidyGrahamBill is a nightmare. You misrepresented your goals to #JimmyKimmel and now you're doing it to us. Don't replace ACA with this!
So you can lie and try to kill people.
@LindseyGrahamSC How do any of you sleep at night? Your lies and attempts to kick MILLIONS of AMERICANS off their health coverage is awful!

I'm sorry I missed it. Did you lie straight-faced or did you stutter and stammer as you spoke with your forked tongue?
the blood of all those americans who die with your bill will be on your hands! Shame on you for putting insurance lobbyists before America
Get a heart. It's ice cold right now
I hope the Rich Koch brothers tax cut is worth ALL THE ELDERLY AND CHILDREN YOU ARE KICKING OFF HEALTHCARE.TELL THAT TO YOUR MAKER SOME DAY
Senator Pinocchio! https://t.co/2o4pTcJf2U?amp=1Say BYE Bill. You lose America wins #grahamcassidy dies not people. No $ from #KochBrothers
You Can't buy their vote! #johnmccain #lisamurkowski #grahamcassidy

Lyin' Bill
How Could YOU! #gopkills
Liar
You are going against your oath, Dr. Cassidy. If this bill passes, you will never be respected I'm the medial field ever again.

Big: GOP Senator Susan Collins confirms Graham-Cassidy would gut protections for pre-existing conditions:

I will work hard for you not to be re elected.


The individuals in charge of helping those most in need in every single state in our nation came out in opposition to GOP’s #Trumpcare bill. https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/911018434804068352 …

That Republicans are bribing Murkowski by letting Alaska KEEP OBAMACARE pretty much destroys the idea that this is better than Obamacare
I'm encouraged you will finally, on Monday, leave your safe space of state tv to hopefully honestly debate your bill. Next, hold hearings!
Did you discuss this?
https://t.co/nL7vs2oQVh?amp=1
Wow. A liar speaking on a network that lies. Should be fine.

Republicans have basically admitted that Obamacare repeal is built on lies: http://slate.me/2xiXNbF  
you should probably be honest about your lies and tell the people your screwing like it is
Explain the deaths to americans you will cause
Of course the only place that wont challenge your lies.  I work in healthcare and I know how bad your bill is.  Your lies don't fool me
What do you say to the astounding number of healthcare organizations (e.g. AMA, AHA, AAP, ACS) who oppose your bill? What do you say doctor?
After doing so much for the health of poor people, you want your deadly healthcare bill to be your legacy? Tragic. Disgusting.
@BillCassidy Why don't you TRY going back on @JimmyKimmelLive & STUFFING your disrespectful LIES back in the mouth & heart, YOU don't have 
You're asking Senators to vote on your bill without the CBO score. Don't you want to know how many millions will be affected?

Your bill sucks and you are a liar. #CassidyGraham
In case you haven't seen this -
Ha!  I completely agree with @jimmykimmel and I'm the NY Medicaid Director. https://twitter.com/nro/status/910692598062428160 …
Who cares u don't that garbage Trumpcare underminded ACA for 7 yrs

I believe that's unconstitutional
SHAME ON YOU BILL CASSIDY. WE ARE ON TO YOU AND YOUR LIES.
The HC cuts are a means to finance future massive tax cuts, & the wealthy donors who benefit are the real constituency for this legislation
LIAR. All about you getting $$. It's not about a better plan.youre willing to kill us for $$. How low! Shameful greed
Lying Bill Cassidy will harm Americans so billionaire supporters will get a tax break. You are awful!
Was it so you could lie to them too?
Who needs the nuclear codes when we have the #GrahamCassidyDeathBill #GrahamCassidyBill

This is not good, is it?

If you too are disappointed in Sen @BillCassidy #GrahamCassidy let them know it - call (202) 224-3121 
cutting medicaid beyond the o-care expansion - wow just wow
Your name forever linked with cutting off health care for millions


NEW: So the attempted bribe of @lisamurkowski is now out in the open. The offer is basically to exempt Alaska from Graham-Cassidy repeal. 1/ https://twitter.com/aslavitt/status/910939185565110272 …

Hello, @LindseyGrahamSC and @BillCassidy. Look long and hard at these pictures. This is my friend Jake. Without ACA he will die. 

President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
You're not even a good liar.
Excellent.
Bill Cassidy is a liar and all liars are essentially cowards
Cassidy ! You have forgotten Hippocratic Oath! DO No HARM! U should be hose whipped! Disgusting and  deplorable GI MD. I smell MELENA!
Everyone call your senators to stop this bill. @lisamurkowski is one of the few senators who stood up for the right thing the last time.
