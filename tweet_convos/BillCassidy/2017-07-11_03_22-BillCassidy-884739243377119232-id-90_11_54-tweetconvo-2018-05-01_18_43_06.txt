Just more ingeniousness. If you listen closely, Bill Cassidy is saying "we'll figure it out later".  "We'll have till 2025"
So it's just more, "set it up now to lose healthcare and trust us to do something by 2025, which we won't" BS
And I'm sure town halls are mostly about healthcare, that is an immediate concern.  Russia is going to be an issue for a while
One might think the big push on healthcare, which everyone knows will fail, is a distraction from the outright corruption happening in @GOP
Healthcare is healthcare no matter what state it is in.  Healthcare in Alaska is the same as in Louisiana.  It doesn't vary by state.
It shouldn't but it does - especially in those states that chose not to expand Medicaid. Sick poor ppl who cannot afford to go to the doc
Healthcare is the same no matter the state but some states help their citizens get it and some states don't.
Pls don't leave healthcare to the states; we know the southern states will not take care of us
So true! Our GOP Governor even reversed  wage increases in #STL
GOP Govs in southern states refused to expand Medicaid and allowed their citizens to suffer; Louisiana just got the expansion with a Dem Gov
Lies and lies and more lies Senator Cassidy. Quite sad you guys cannot get past party to do what is best for the people.
It's very sad. The only reason they WANT to pass #tRumpDoesntCare is to give that #TaxCut to big money donors. #QuidProQuo #GOPisComplicit
exactly @Morning_Joe @Sen_JoeManchin @BillCassidy
You've brought back pre-existing conditions? You got some kinda special Louisiana clause?We don't want this. Quit making GOP deals & #voteno
Way to throw your Louisiana constituency under the bus Mr. Cassidy. Shame on you.
QUIT APPEARING ON TV. APPEAR IN Louisiana!! QUIT LYING TO US. We know u want to do what is best for you($) and the GOP,not Louisiana #voteno

U keep saying "Obamacare is failing, premiums are skyrocketing" but you've never backed it up w/facts. I like #Facts. #SaveACA #DontBeACrook
STOP funding the Medicaid expansions!!!

A horrific metaphor for Trumpcare: this disabled woman literally being ripped from her wheelchair. 
#StopTrumpcare  
You kept people outside of Town Halls. Do not use us as your excuse for not questioning #TrumpRussia collusion, @BillCassidy @JohnKennedyLA
Sen Cassidy heard u say "in town halls not one question on Russia".  Shall we take that as it's ok to meet with them as we run for office???
US Corp sold to Nazi Germany, Halliburton to Iran despite sanctions; private sector knows what they're doing & it's not about patriotism
Please! Preserve ACA & economy of La! ACA should be MAINTAINED & IMPROVED!
Do right by Louisiana!! Time for party politics is over.
How u get any republican to go on your stupid show is beyond me
We R not asking about Russia because the Democrats, Press, Special Procuter and a few Republicans are doing a great job investigating.
@BillCassidy a bit clueless. Should grammas with dementia get a better job so they can afford their secure unit?
#Louisiana #LA your Senator is selling you out right now #saveACA this guy is a deceiver. #saveMedicare #saveMedicaid

Same ole crap.
Block grants will cause Medicare to fall short #NoBCRA
New PPI report: per enrollee cap in #BRCA falls short- resulting in cuts to State #Medicaid programs http://bit.ly/2tNv0Y1  
He has children of his own and he's willing to throw others under the bus????  What happened to "do no harm"????
Senator Cassidy; FYI, Russia is a Major concern of the people; I am very concerned how the repubs are trying to downplay this issue
I participated in Conf Call Twn Hall last nt - asked about ACA.  Didn't ask about Russia but VERY CONCERNED. Have confidence in Mueller Team
Bill even ur picture says a lot about u. coward
HAHAHAHAHAHA OMG!  A PRIVATE INSURANCE OPTION FOR THE POOR!!!  YOU'RE AN IDIOT!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCv54970jZQ … HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA #
@BillCassidy is right
#NoCutsToMedicaid #NoAHCA #NoBCRA #SaveOurCare #StopTrumpCare
Bill Cassidy says he's undecided on Trumpcare, but he made a promise to this cancer mom. Don't let him forget it.…
ANYONE Trump appears to be DIRTY !
Only hearing about Healthcare because GOP wants to pass #TrumpCare in secret, quickly. Few have held town halls most are avoiding citizens
@BillCassidy is lying; Russia is not a "distraction" to the ppl of Louisiana...oh and by the way, ~500,000 depend on Medicaid expansion
No, a lot of people are not turning down higher paying jobs because they fear losing Medicaid.  That's BS.  But it shows Medicaid is good.
@BillCassidy we don't ask GOP about #TrumpRussia because Mueller will get to all info and #FreePress will report it #TrumpRussia
Why will interviewers never ask the follow-up question regarding where the 760 billion in Medicaid cuts are going
This plan, this bill would do just that.
Senator Cassidy has no clue on healthcare. I thought sir that that you as a doctor was to do first was to do no harm.
Stop the Sabotage Stop lying Fix the ACA Single payer cost less covers more.
Tax cuts for Bill Cassidy when he cuts $770 Billion from medicaid!
Bill Cassidy wants to take your insurance and medicaid away from you AND he's a physician!  (rich physician?)
Pathetic/our democracy is in danger by a corrupt WH & u deflect/ shame on u/the GOP is complicit in everything Trump
"Take a knee"? What does that mean? Dumb reference, stop using it.
We see what their doing with the educational funds. Why in the hell would we let the state handle medical...smh
@BillCassidy Health insurance back to the states?! So a pre-existing condition might be covered in NY but not LA? You need to be voted out.
.@BillCassidy just said "people won't take better paying job bc they don't wanna lose Medicaid"- BS!More slander of the unemployed. Shame!
Joe, ask him where the 760 billion in cuts are going
Sen Bill Cassidy is here promoting a bill he hasent seen yet talking about some crappy amendment he' s pushing Really  What a Phony?
Cassidy lying. Republicans on health care insurance are beyond despicable. This bill is massive tax cut for wealthy.
Bill... Does La pay your health care!!! Oh okay you have no worries.. La should NOT get their hands on our medical. It'll be another lie
Give it back to the states--means We don't want to have to do this.  GOP is unbelievably inept.
Putin blocked adoptions, not the US. More likely Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya spoke with Trump jr about  U.S. sanctions!

What was that last song that brought you back from commercial at 7:24am? It's driving me crazy. Thanks!
The White House Press Office might call it fake news but it's real jail time, just ask the watergate seven

Need to have their butts at work not on dang tv
The USA banks wont lend to Trump,Trump knows the russains & banks they will lend to him ,& they don't know the Russians bullshit
Morning groupthink.
And Trump's British 'Brexit' buddy Nigel Farrage... visited the embassy where Julian Assange from @wikileaks hides.

Way way way too many commercials to watch 5 mins of news !!! I pay for cable . Why all the commercials ?
Tell us again why we should "join" a network intent on removing a sitting U.S. President?  Breaking!  Hillary Lost.  Get over it!
Your remiss to not point out that @POTUS tweeted abt HRC's email at 4:40 6/9/16 the afternoon of Jrs meeting!

Trump's newest talking point direct from the Motherland.
Trump's United States of Soviet America isn't really working for the GOP anymore
I can guarantee Don jr is not the ONLY one & you know damn well daddy knew it,THIS PRESIDENCY IS IN DEEP SHIT
This dope is the new "Teflon Don" because of Congress' inaction and fond hope to use him to pass repugnant legislation.
Bye the bye..I would believe Clint watts before mark re: leak sources in intel community
#FollowTheMoney @realDonaldTrump is an unwitting Russian agent #followTheMoney
Great line Joe, "Trump's house of cards build on Russian money!!!"

Hope you ask about health insurance lobby $ in Congress. Over $30 mil spent in 2010 when ACA was debated to ensure insurance kept control.
@SpeakerRyan & Mitch McConnell - What do you say to protect our democracy?  Time to put country over party #FollowTheMoney
God Bless our President! The Bull Shit media is makings you stronger! We the American people will drain the Swamp!
Good morning!
Flynn,Russia, Kushner, Comey and now Trumps son. What next week? We the People are sick of the media Bull Shit. God Bless our President!
time for trump to go.
Why do you continue to have the same people every morning saying the same thing. Where is the news.
Watch these two say nothing about Obstruction Of Justice, or deliberately run from saying their is enough already to impeach Trump.
Collusion by Clinton Campaign
