You are too funny! I love your humor. 
No.
 you Gov Huckabee
I love it. You're actually mocking TV christianity and the mindless consumers of it.  Yet, they don't have the mental prowess to get it.  #FakeChristian #FakeChristianity #wakeupchristians
I don't think that Mr Huckabee is making fun of any kind of Christianity, TV or otherwise. It's truly wild where the liberal left lunatic fringe's mind goes, glad I don't have a map to follow. Scary places there in the dark I'd imagine.
Nothing but light, brother!
Lol
Gov, I hate to say it but few REALLY believe that Fox "Business" "News" is a business news channel. YOU are on the right channel.
How does one learn to be this not funny?
The fact that his daughter has similar levels of charm and wit, suggests it's hereditary.

I'll imagine your #MAGA bowel movement after oatmeal if you imagine my #MAGA bowel movement after oatmeal. We'll (Both) earn #BiglyRatings! USA! NOT SAD! 
The only thing you guys can magically send over the airwaves is bullshit
Oatmeal for breakfast it is!
Absolutely!
No Tanks, Gov., but Democrats will have a Large Healthy Serving of It! I'm sure they are Believers of that, and esp. when they're Hungry! Ha!

It ain’t over till your fat lady sings. I bet Sarah carries quite a tune.
Too early. See you after noon.
Please could my oatmeal have with blueberries.

What would I have to say to get you to block me?
Gee thx, but no thanks.
A pot of coffee and you got a deal!  Oh and you can have my share of oatmeal. lol
Speaking of Christianity...

Maybe if Yourself and Star Trek reach some sort of agreement, and They let you play with their Toys
Yes, please with blueberries, cinnamon and vanilla almond milk! 
When you have eczema you have oatmeal every day, my struggle is real, lol. Guess we might not be talking about the same oatmeal, I digress sometimes. Maybe why they call me a deplorable.
I BELIEVE!! I BELIEVE!!
Late night, early mornings! 
Every day!
I have oatmeal w/maple sugar and fresh cream every morning with buttered raisin toast. All that + a tall glass of ice cold milk.
You need new meds dude.
"Bigly Mac Please"
Hahahaha

LORD, God of hosts, who is like you? Mighty LORD, your faithfulness surrounds you. You rule the raging sea; you still its swelling waves. Yours are the heavens, yours the earth; you founded the world and everything in it. Psalms 89: 9-10,12
Only if it has fresh peaches in it!
You are hilarious. Please take Shep’s spot @FoxNews
FOX NEWS is FAKE NEWS just like your show.
Cinnamon /raisin please, oh nevermind peaches and cream baby
You had better lay off the meth!
You first.

My folks made us eat oatmeal Christmas morning b4 we could get into presents! Sadly I have not eaten oatmeal since then, but my faith is stronger than ever!

No oatmeal, but will turn off Fox & Friends, and watch Fox Business.
Do bacon...then we'll talk.  
Don’t like oatmeal but I eat it
