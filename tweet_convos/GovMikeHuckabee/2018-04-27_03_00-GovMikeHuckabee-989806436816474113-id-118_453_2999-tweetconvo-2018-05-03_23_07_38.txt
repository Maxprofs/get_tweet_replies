.@POTUS takes a picture surrounded by children in the Oval Office during Take Your Child To Work Day at the @WhiteHouse in Washington, DC on April 26, 2018. pic.twitter.com/VgGmZ97zq0
Is there a single African American kid in that photo?
Not easy! Haha.. they are all adorable!
Mike, you rat! There is only ONE face in this photograph that anyone wants to see!!! @realDonaldTrumppic.twitter.com/Fqe39rDMEP
Awww aren’t they all adorable?!!! Our precious future!
I'll look for the one trying to strangle a dog. #HuckabeeFamilyValues
The fat, cross-eyed ones that are lying to the others?...
You’re a horrible role model for those “three” grandchildren.

Sen. Bob Corker was right. It really is a daycare center in the WH and Trump is in the middle. He doesn't look as if he's the clever one though.
Creepy.
@GovMikeHuckabee you are a national treasure! I love your sense of humor!
Who cares.
Hard to spot until they open their mouth. Then it is easy. They are they the ones born 3rd generation liars.
You're really going to attack children?
Admittedly not my best moment. That said the Huckabee's are engines of a propaganda machine that repeats and supports verifiable lies that threaten my me, my children, my country and generations to come. So this is what it has come to I guess.
You can believe that, but I choose to say you're wrong and hope one day you see that. Hug your babies. I appreciate your honesty and what I believe to be an apology.
To be clear, I should not cast the wrongs of Mike and Sarah onto their next gen. It is not a belief that they are liars, it is fact and those lies hurt children. They deny #climatechange & other science They support $1T deficits They support gutting the epa All hurt children
Yeah, Right! Don’t ever lose your sense of humor. Love it!
