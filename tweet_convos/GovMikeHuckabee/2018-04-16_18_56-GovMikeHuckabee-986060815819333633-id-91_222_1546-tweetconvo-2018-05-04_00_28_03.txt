Except I don't care about how many followers I have. lol Your man clearly does so how do you address those 400,000 fake followers? I DID my audit and got rid of as many as I could. Why not encourage him to do the same? Seriously? Attack me all you want but what about it?
I don’t even have to try to clear out Fake Followers. It’s natural.
Well, I know you hate me but how do you do it? Cuz you've got a better percentage then your man and me combined.
So I don’t hate you at all I was just going to tell you to have a good day. TBH, i don’t do anything special, People follow me and I usually folllow back. It might be because you’re verified, that somehow you get a lot of more spam followers. Also don’t use third party apps.
Third Party apps can leach fake followers onto people and if people. Pay for followers it can also come up as “fake followers”. Good luck, I really wish you no harm but I poke at those who poke at others and I expect the same. Have a good day.
Sorry my sentences were broken up, Trump supporter here.
Loved her. Those guys put out some great videos.
Congratulations governor, now let’s work on getting Jeff sessions removed from office
That lady was awesome...
They only follow you, to see what a bullshiter you are
To whom much is given, much will be required
What does this even mean?
“The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.” Matthew 13:10-11 NIVhttp://bible.com/111/mat.13.10-11.niv
