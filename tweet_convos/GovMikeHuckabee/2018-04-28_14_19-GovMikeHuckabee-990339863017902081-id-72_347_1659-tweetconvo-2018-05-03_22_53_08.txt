Agreed
Congratulations! You're #1, you're #1!
Sick of the lies
I watch it every week! Hope to come see it live one day! Keep up the good work! My parents watch it each week too now.
Your playing to the Alzheimer’s crowd. Just like Drump. He has Alzheimer’s.
Speaking of TV... I just checked CNN coverage of tonight's Correspondence Dinner's 'red carpet".  Who's first up? Michael Avenatti, lawyer for Stormy Daniels.  If there was any doubt that POTUS was right to blow it off... that ended it.   #LosersProm
I'm sorry, how do you know what's the "# 1" thing to do in nursing homes? Have you ever worked in one? Visited one? As a nurse I can tell you those ladies and gentlemen deserve more respect than to be used as a plug for your show. Disgusting.
Not
Well, I think that sums up everything I need to know.
You have a show?
That people watch?
 you’re dumb
I work in a nursing home, and I always change it to MSNBC for them. Your welcome! Here to help!
You do realize @jimmyfallon has 50 million more followers then you do right? #FactsMatter #FakeNews #VoteThemOut #BlueWave2018 #TheResistance
Hahaha, "#1 thing to do in nursing homes," that just means your fan base is dying off.  You honestly think that's something to brag about?  Nobody who understands the world today likes you or your show.
Love your show! We tell everyone about it and DVR in case we miss it. Keep going Gov. Esp love your opening monologues. The other late night hosts could take lessons from you!
Captive elderly people watch you and that's all you can get.
Love that you are #1 though I am not sure why Steve Harvey isn’t higher than he is .
My grandma said she would rather die. Also, calories.
I love your sense of humor!
klove you
Nothing like bragging that it's only senile people who can stand to watch you! Bravo!
Well deserved
Sir you are too hard on them specially @JimmyKimmelLive
If Mike Huckerbee is doing as well as he Claims he is doing on his Failing Gibberish Show, why is he on Steroids potentially dispensed by Trump's doctor Ronny Jackson, the "Candy man" trying to drum up an audience? Desperate. Sarah Huckerbee Saunders' daddy..
Yeah right,Stephen Colbert is the man
Congratulations! #MAGA 

Way to go Gov !!!
Love this guy! Daily chuckle!!
I’m surprised Fallon could keep 3 ranking.
I am thrilled with the #1 and #2 on the list. I just don't get how Tapper and Corden fit on the same list.
guv, you're on in nursing homes, really? shout out a plug, promote yourself... time??? channel??? day??? night???  enquiring minds want to know...
That's great!!!
AWESOME
I love it.
Would like to watch but Comcast cable doesnt carry the station. Sad
While your buddy in the Oval Office wants to cut our Social Security, Medicare, raise the rent in senior housing, made it more difficult to sue nursing homes. No thanks
Ass.
How do you breakup an ISIS bingo game?? Holler...B..52! (that one goes over BIG at #ShadyPines nursing home)!
That’s not a picture of you @GovMikeHuckabee
Your Twitter feed has one of the highest laugh snorts to tweet ratio out there.

Gov Mike, The Silent Majority is roaring your name! 
Yeah team Mike.

If you miss it on the weekend- then stream the replay at work. Your government job is safe. #NoOneGetsFired
