It was a great show! Love @BellamyBrothers  #LetYourLoveFlow #RedNeckGirl
You betcha! Love me some Brothers!
Rock on with your bad self Governor Huckabee!
Great show! Thanks for your talented show!
No thanks. I'm not interested in watching one hit wonders on the show of a complete failure.
Starting in the late 1970s, the Bellamy Brothers found success in country music as well, charting twenty Number One singles and more than fifty hits overall on the country charts. To date, they have released more than fifty albums, primarily on Curb Records.
Thanks for the info.  Isn't Wikipedia handy. Let me rephrase my comment.  I'm not interested in watching anyone on the show of a complete failure.
Any of your love flowing to people in Gaza?

Liked that song my whole life and now it’s ruined because as the Huckabee stench on it.
You like reminiscing about the good ole days when people of color were the minority and knew their place, right Mike? HYPOCRITE. RACIST. LIAR.


Great to see you on the show! I love that song. See you have a book with the same title!
Great tune from the late 60s!
I see you are living in the past with the Bone Spur President.......
