AMEN..!!! 
Don’t think she would want your gods blessing. She was a Christian not part of the church of trump like you evangelicals
You said it, you don’t think, and you shouldn’t tweet either,
She is reunited with her daughter that she lost many years ago.
Remember when your son tortured that dog to death?
this is so great. this reply is just really great. good
Meanwhile you and your family will be remembered for lies.
with a million followers, I would've expected your tweet to have a thousand comments. They have us on limited feeds.
Bots cant reply

Your son plans killing a dog in her honor.
You serious?  What a dbag.
DITTO. 
That's a joke!!  Who's God are you talking about. He hates you!!!
PERFECT
There's such a thing as being too gracious. The Bush family has made it known how much they despise @POTUS  
Praising any of them is a form of patriotic sellout and weakness.
Great lady


Well said!
You are one of the most hypocritical Evangelicals in the Nation today. As @realdonaldtrump attacked the Bush Family demonizing Mrs. Bush’s husband and son you stood silent!
Loved her
She was loved by Millions, and millions, and millions.
Barbara Bush was from an age when the Republican Party still had some honor. Not so now that you charlatans have prostituted the @GOP to the #TrumpCult.
America has lost a truly great lady in the passing of Mrs.Barbara Bush. She will be sorely missed by many. The Bush family are our Prayers.
Barbara was surrounded by thugs and thieves her whole life and didn't know it: husband, son GW, father-in-law and father.
Amen and Amen
Who cares
No one will say the same for you but about 12 viewers.
Walk away
Shut up
God bless their family
I’m sure they are moved by your words. (Lying about that too?)
Such a strong woman she was. We need more Republican women like her.
my thoughts are with President Bush so many years today God Bless Him
finally a good joke 
Seriously
Hey, you finally made a funny tweet.

Thank you 
Great First Lady Barbara God Bless you and your family.
