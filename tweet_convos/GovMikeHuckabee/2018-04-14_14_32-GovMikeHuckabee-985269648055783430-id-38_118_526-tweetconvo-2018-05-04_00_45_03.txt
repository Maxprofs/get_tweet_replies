@GovMikeHuckabee Do you even understand what a Laffer Curve is?
The Laffer Curve is as fake as you are.

Laffer curve is a fraud and totally discredited by history. But then truth and integrity no longer matters to you.

Art is one of your best guests since your program went on the air. I always learn something from him... bring back often!

Paul Ryan's Most Lasting Legacy: Permanent Trillion-Dollar Deficits
Ya know, u can stack all of the economists in the world on top of each other and they still couldn’t reach a conclusion. 
Old stockbroker joke.

Written on a napkin and shoul have been in the trash. It’s pure fantasy
Luv the picture!
The Laughter Curve is probably the most facetious economic theory ever drawn at the back of a napkin!
You do understand that Laffer Curve is about taxes on the Production Activity. 1: production is very minimal here in US; 2: There is no US tax on products produced, instead producers in US gets a domestic production tax credit.
What a legend.
Has the same sleazy look as the Huckabees
The Laughter Curve?
The trickle down man you might know a greedy evangelical likes
Laugher
The laffer curve is debunked pseudo-economics also you are a hacky ham man

A rare and beautiful thing!  Looking foward to it!
You get fatter by the day, Mike.

Also, the Laffer curve is garbage. History proves, tax cuts to the wealthiest do not pay for themselves.
