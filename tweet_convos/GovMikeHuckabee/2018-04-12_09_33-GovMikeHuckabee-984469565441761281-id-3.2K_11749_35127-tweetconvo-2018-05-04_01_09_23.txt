Love our @PressSec
She is the worst
No. Actually, she's the best. Apparently you didn't read the article.
If that's true, then you also have to admit that Michelle and Barack are better than Sarah and DJT. So, sure.
He wasn’t in the left column like HE should be
Tagging you @jack in absurdly inappropriate comments until @Twitter  gets it right #BanTheRealBulliesNow
CRY HARDER 

"I'm an adult getting bullied by adults on a social platform I choose to use, WAAAAAAAAH" 
 

Even your cats hate you.  
Not all is lost for Jim.  Based on his performance so far in 2018, I’m certain he will be the back-to-back winner for this special award. 
Boy you Trumpists really do like your fake Time covers.
I saw your profile and thought you might like this superhero one for your collection?  

#MAGA 
#Trump
Interesting you rely on fictional depictions of Trumps non-accomplishments.  Also interesting he appears to be grabbing lady Liberty by pussy in this depiction.
Ah-Kay DOODY.  Oh, I fixed your profile pic.  

Jim Acosta is going to be crying once he reads this. He is very sensitive!
Mmm no he’s not.
Yep! Here he is crying. Proof!!
Umm, I think that image is photoshopped.
Can't get anything past you......
he used the word "proof".  Unlike for you Trumpists, #FactsMatter for the 60-65% of America that doesn't support the denigration of America that is ongoing.

Is Doody still nattering? 

The little coward blocked me...LOL
I love Sarah, she is a woman to be admired, a real role model as a mother, a professional working woman and has the highest moral values and integrity. So proud of her!!
What do you admire most? Her faux Christianity? Her pathological dishonesty? Her immorality? Her incompetence? Her willingness to be an accomplice to treason?
Explain each accusation. You are so wrong.
Do you want the intelligent version or the Trump cultist version?
That you instantly break answers into "intelligent or what Trump voters can understand" shows your bigotry, hatred, sexism, racism, whatever.  I hold a college degree, I'll pit my mind against yours any day, or would if I didn't know you'd just lie and cheat like all liberals.
Not at all, it's a simple recognition of reality.  Trump himself bragged of enjoying the support of unintelligent voters
SMH..in other words POTUS loves all people of all intellect levels. He treats everyone the same. He does not think that he is better than anyone. That comes from character of his soul, which YOU are lacking. And YOU ARE unaware he has Genius IQ.  (I am sure you lack that too)
ROFL Genius IQ?  SERIOUSLY
NICE!!! 
She does a great job
Yes, she's a great liar.
No you just don’t want to see the truth I fill sorry for you and many like you have a great Trump day
 The truth. 
Yes, the truth unpopular libtard with only 600 followers worldwide.
Erm...jonibadass1960 (great handle, BTW!) who started this sub-thread, has only 32.
Way to go @PressSec ! You are a star! Applaud you daily. Poise, brains, and wit!
Not the most scientific poll but will not begrudge your fatherly pride despite my utter disdain for the current administration.   Adding World’s Most Admired which has @BarackObama and @MichelleObama both #2 and, per your citation, both #1 in USA.
Dear comedian Mike, 

I have questions:

• Where on the list did @PressSec's left eye appear, you know, the weird & evil lying one?

• When her brother (your son, the handsome devil below) murdered a dog, do you think it affected the results in any way?
Just great. More bullies on twitter working out if moms basement. Get a life. #shitstain
Trump is tweeting from his mother's basement now? I hope the corpse doesn't stink too much.
Mike here's 3650 more Likes
for the Incredible Job Sarah is doing babysitting the MSM 
Her parents clearly raised her 
Right 
She is wonderful!!
Prune face Warren, pffft.
Wow, congrats, Mike. You must be very proud. I have to admit, I'd never heard of that survey, and Wikipedia tells me it's not based in the USA. I hope it'll bring both of you comfort when she's in jail. 

#FakeChristian 
#LiarLiarPantsOnFire
. Yea, throw a press secretary in jail.  Been asleep for the last 8 years?
To turn the mindless , unfocused, ignorance of this administration into some kind of defendable policy is truly a talent.
Know you are so proud! Sarah is quite an independent and well versed Lady. President Trump chose well for his Press Sec. and we are all impressed by the job she has done so far.
Sarah rocks! A Woman whom I would be proud for my daughters to have as role model!!
#DeportJimAcosta
Awesome. So well deserved.
You go girl
Congrats Gov and Congrats to Sarah. She is doing a great job.
Congratulate her with a gift she really needs.
@PenelopePratts @WahcaMia @TheRickWilson @HockeyFanGirl12 @Las4Liberty @solomongrundy6 @ReaganBattalion @just_old_joe @sawsharee @kellyz713
A lifetime supply of Truth Serum!
Lol! Yes!
.@GovMikeHuckabee @LETitRlDE @PressSec Sarah you go girl. I love seeing you especially the savvy beat down of -->> @Acosta
 Her party must be so proud!!!!!
Her PARENTS must be so proud spellcheck 
Admired by who?!
Good genes
She is a lioness . You raised a fine courageous woman 
To be fair, the Acosta vote was probably split.
Love you @PressSec all young women should look up to you.
Love Sarah
Sir, your daughter rates so high above Elizabeth (run HP in the ground) Warren and Taylor (extorted and not so) Swift that it’s a shame she’s even in the same sentence with them! I compare her to my daughters. That’s a compliment! Great job Mike! @ljcambria @CarrollQuigley1
Proud Peacock Daddy Huckabee!
Possibly the proudest man in America! Based on the fruit, the tree deserves the right to be proud. Real America is proud!
She's a doll too dad.
Congrats Sarah
You should be One Proud Papa. Congrats Sarah!
Congratulations to Sarah but how could pocohantis even be mentioned in this category, the only good thing she could do for her country is retire
We love our Pres Secretary

Did Lizzy "SakajaFaka" Warren make the most admired American Native list?
I've admired her from day 1. Your daughter is amazing!
She is terrific!
She is amazing.
Yeah!  She deserves it!  
You earned it sara
Omg. A good father
WHAT A HILARIOUS JOKE! HER RUDE BEHAVIOR AND LIES IS A REGULAR TOPIC OF HORROR
I'll vote for Sarah any day any time for any post over that fake Indian.
Be proud, @GovMikeHuckabee! She is truly an inspiration for us all!! Thank you, @PressSec for helping show my daughters how to be tough and classy!

Who was #1?
Bull
Sarah is awesome, @POTUS is lucky (or smart) to have her in the @PressSec roll. She is in good company with the incredibly talented, strong women in the WH, @flotus @nikkihaley @SecNielsen @SBALinda @BetsyDeVosED @KellyannePolls & so many more to admire, gd pi too @foxandfriends
Box score ... Sarah - 1,000, Press - 0. You go girl!
That must be an Average score including @FoxNews @JimAcosta has a -1,000 avg.


Eeewww Elizabeth Warren so gross
right not sure how she made it
Congrats Sarah, and Governor for raising such a great daughter!
Oh SuckABee, only if the CMAs would take you back. SINCE THEY WON'T EVER IN YOUR LIFETIME,   TOO FUNNY! 

Also, remember, allow ur grandchildren around the "grab her by the pussy" demagogue dictator that you both cherish. Dictators eventually end up dead, Trump jail.  
I adore your daughter. She’s a #BOSS
She's pretty awsome.
She's a role model alright, now tell her to lift up her shirt and model some of those rolls
Congrats Sarah!! You have earned it by having to deal with the liberal walking dead, day in and day out!!
Sarah is the best! A woman warrior and patriot.
Amen!
She is a class act! Love her
I totally agree!!!
The Huckabee family must be the biggest producers of cow manure in Arkansas.
 her
Well deserved ! She is a warrior and never backs down, love her !

Sarah rocks!!
wha???? so liars are revered in your world, good to know.
Are you seriously addressing a father and calling his daughter a liar?  You obviously don’t have a daughter. Unbelievable the trolls that are on Social media. Hate speech?  This didn’t make me feel good . Oh wait, I’m not a liberal so my “feelings “ don’t matter!
Sarah Sanders America’s Sweetheart 
Governor Huckabee she is your pride and joy, hats off to you for raising a lovely lady! Everyone should be aware how a child who is raised by a loving faithful father, can grow up to be anything she wants even the president's press secretary!
That is wonderful news!!! Well deserved as @PressSec is an amazing woman. God's blessings to you all.
 Sarah is awesome.
She is the best @PressSec ever.  From what I see she is also a very good person.  Congrats.

Is your son top 10 in dogkiller magazine?  Asking for a friend

 WHAT A FUCKING JOKE! NOBODY WITH ANY MORALS OR STANDARDS HAS ANY RESPECT FOR YOUR LYING ASS DAUGHTER..SHES A DISGRACE TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE..HOPE SHE KNOWS SELLING YOUR SOUL COMES WITH A PRICE..SHE WILL PAY DEARLY FOR EVERYDAY SHE STAYS & CONTINUES TO LIE FOR ASSHOLE TRUMP
Jealousy and a pottymouth! Not a good sign Sylvia!
You bot!
U R A #FauxChristian lol
Yet
Never
Strange....this image is from http://YouGov.com  and I don’t see @presssec or Warren on the list.....Maybe YouGov’s website is incorrect??? Or perhaps your source http://ConservativeTribune.com  is suspect?  Did u seriously think we wouldn’t check it out (like u should have done!)??
So now, Dad, you’ve made your daughter a laughing stock....shame on you!
Oh she does just fine on her own lol!
You can be very proud because you  followed the wonderful instructions  given you directly from the Good Lord himself: Rear your children in the way they should go...and as they grow older they will not depart from it-thanks #GovernorHuckabee.
Congrats to Sarah!

We LOVE Sarah! WhooHoo! She deserves All good things! #MAGA
Awesome
That's why we write letters to her at Letters4trump 
We admire her much!!
I love Sarah! I thought, wrongly; that she was not the person for the job. Wow, was I WRONG! Sarah is excellent, knowledgeable, and takes no shit! That's an amazingly hard job. I have to apologize to Sarah for thinking she wasn't right for the job. ADMIRATION!
Sara is the best!
Congrats, Sarah!!!
She is such a role model and has the sharpest mind I have ever seen! GO Sara!! Love to watch her!
Congratulations to @Shelleyflower77 and @SaucierSadie for being admired by their Twitter family "Through Thick-N-Thin" for Kristian Saucier.  

She is truly the woman I most admire in politics.  She's smart, witty, strong, all while being a decent and honest person - rare combination.  I'd love to see President @PressSec in 2024.
#SarahSanders @PressSec is the epitome of cool under fire- how she puts up with the incessant idiocy, the baiting & the bullying is beyond me- she is a gem!
The face of fake news???? Nawwww!
We LOVE our @PressSec !!
She would get my vote!!
How can anyone NOT love Sarah! She's the epitome of today's woman, she's the whole package. You did well Governor, very well!
Congratulations, Sarah! 
She is a class act. Maybe Elizabeth should start taking notes. Because same people who voted for this .... also vote at the polls.....
Has to try and insult people before providing a vague answer. She's weak..quote scripture and support an adulterer. Outstanding morals right there.

You gotta be fucking kidding! What list is this?
That is fabulous news, congratulations !!!! I love her, she cracks me up!
Congrat`s to your gifted and impressive daughter. I am often in awe of her calm and poise, especially when being attacked daily. #MAGA
Congrats to @PressSec, who in the hell voted for Elizabeth Warren???
You did good Mike.
She is a great Lady, thank you Sarah.
Congrats @PressSec well deserved! You are an inspiration to young women across AMERICA!

What's not to admire 
Way to go @PressSec! Well deserved as you do a great job under sometimes difficult circumstances from those who supposedly are for women’s rights. Good thing @SenWarren didn’t get bonus points for being Native American
Congrats to Sarah, well deserved. She stands up to a barrage of real deplorables daily and as my dear Mother used to say. She must have a strong Constitution.
No one knows what YouGov is nor cares. In other news, I was recently polled as most likely to become president in high school. See? No one cares.


"Conservative Tribune".
Yes. I don't imagine those votes were slanted at all.
I wonder how much Huckabee had to pay to get them to say something nice about his daughter.
Evidently, the folks at Conservative Tribune can't read. Taylor Swift is #13, @elizabethforma (Warren) is #20, and @PressSec didn't make the top 20. Sorry, papa bear, but she's somebody only a father could love.
Sorry, Taylor Swift is #9. Deepika Padukone is #13. Still no Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

How sweet papa pig is so proud of his piglet.
 did Putin hack that too?
That’s only because they love cows in England where this weird-ass poll was taken.
That proves the YouGov survey is garbage.   The @presssec is nasty, condescending and rude.   She's also a liar.

Love her! Strong and no nonsense woman who will speak her mind and stand her ground  Girl power
Congratulations press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders
Well, it's not surprising .... she was raised right by GOOD PARENTS!
.
Congratulations to all THREE of you!
You have to be as proud of her and the fantastic job doing as we are!!! Keep up the great work @PressSec We adore you!!!
Adore Sara Sanders!!!!
Strong Patriot!
#liar #liable #deflecter #LyingIsASin
Never heard of this survey...anyhow pretty sure it's a nothingburger.
I so admire your sweet strong daughter.  A real role model for our girls.
We love Sarah. She is one tough young lady. Proud of how she does her job and stands for us Americans and our President. God bless you
If my child lied like that, no, I would not be proud. Secondly, what kind of father would want his daughter any where near a man like Trump?
I just love what a proud father you are.
She has certainly earned this honor!  Congratulaions!
Really? Can’t seem to find her on the list. You must be reading between the lines.
@GovMikeHuckabee As Sarah's father you should be very very proud of the job she is doing in Washington. As your daughter, you should be very proud. She is someone all young women should look up to! God bless you and you family!
Class patience & true grit we love her!!! CONGRATS Sarah
I love Sarah, such a classy, smart, funny lady!
She looks better too
Proud Dad:) shes a Great person.
So PROUD of SARAH!! She IS UNDOUBTEDLY the BEST PRESS SECRETARY in HISTORY and A CLASSY, BEAUTIFUL & EXTREMELY TALENTED LADY!!
You must be a proud dad. You did a great job Governor, she’s a lot like you.
*APPLAUSE*
America loves and respects @PressSecSarahSanders, she’s a “ Chip off of the ole block”! Congratulations Sarah, you are a gem! 
congratulations to Sarah Sanders! Love her!
Why are you so spiteful? Aren’t you into Jesus?
‘I adore @SarahHuckabee such class w/ a winning smile. Best @PressSec EVER. She’s adorable.
Finally they got one right...she’s the best and most completed in my book...
Thanks Sara 
@PressSecSanders is an intelligent, beautiful, lady, knows her job very well, excellent is able to cope with the most absurd ridiculous morons ever to walk on the Earth, & I love to hear her, & watch her press conferences.  Good, far better than the liar BIG POLKAHAUNTIS.
You and your wife did a good job raising her...congratulations!!!!
Each time I hear her field some of those questions, I truly am in Awe that she hasn't thrown something at some of them.  Must be why I'm here and she's there....LOL
Whenever I see her giving a press conference it's a joy to watch her on the job. She is a strong woman and balances her personality and position with some very aggressive, hurtful, disrespectful and unkind reporters. Acosta tries to break her but she is patient and stays on task.
Congratulations @PressSec Sarah! You are the best! Only you could handle being asked the same question 2,000 times!
Jim Acosta! LMAO
Ohhhh look an ACTUAL role model for my daughters. A very rare find indeed. Keep it up!!
Love Sarah by the time she’s done being @PressSec she’s going to earn the status of Saint! I’d have been in jail by now for slugging stupidity! I can only handle stupid in small doses, she’s forced to feed on it daily! 
She is one great woman
@Acosta made the list of most admired trannies.
Sarah is an awesome lady.
Kudo’s Sarah
Yay Sarah!
I think she’s amazing!! Great poise and strength!!! I want my girl children to behave as she does!!!
Congrats to @PressSec she is such an aspiring young woman, setting the path for future generations of women.
Yeahhhhhh!!!!!! Sarah, you deserved it!!!!!! 
@Jim Acosta is crying in the corner....he didn't make the list
#ILoveSarahSanders !!!!!!
Your daughter is seriously the best Press Secretary ever! I have no idea how she so graciously and wisely handles the ridiculous and obvious political posturing like she does every day! I know you’re a proud and blessed dad!
THAT is awesome, and wonderful!!    God Bless you and your entire, great Family Sir.
@PressSec is awesome and one of Americas sweethearts. Go and get them Sarah!
Congratulations Sarah. Well done and deserved!
GO Sarah!!!
Glad the poll confirms what we already know...@PressSec is amazing, extraordinary woman, wife, Mother, daughter. No one has held this post as a young woman w/ 3 young children...much less, bake pies, April Ryan!
and you can tell lizzy doesn't
                                             like it.
Fake survey!
Most admired bahahaha she’s scary to even look at, yea let’s admire liars. This article was paid for by CRAZY MIKE
Good Job Sara
Great lady acting with conviction, honesty and confidence!
She’s awesome... she takes a lot of crap and let’s it roll right off, professional and tough. Well deserved!
she is great
And she deserves it. Classy lady
I very proud of her. Bet you are a really proud Dad! God bless!
Very well deserved!

Do any of you people defending Warren live in Massachusetts? Because I do ..... she is a pompous liar and anyone who admires her is sure setting the bar low
Looks like Hillary beat your lying joke of a daughter though...
Who the Hell admires someone who lies for a living?
Am I missing something?
Cause you meed to look at the “alternative” list dummy!
And he did say “women,” the list you showed was “men & women,” so you are missing something. The correct list! #ha
How do I miss ‘meed’ instead of ‘need’ #PULLEDaTRUMP
Yay Sarah!!!! Congratulations! We love you!
Hey Jazelle, I am trying to post the list but I can’t find this list with Sarah on there. Can you please post? Thanks!
The survey was done by YouGov. I hope this helps. I'm not finding the actual list either.
Thanks! I found it on their website. Not a huge fan of most women on there!
Congratulations Sarah! Jesus bless and protect you and your family. 
Mike,

I admire you daughter because everyday she puts on a joker face and puts on a clown show to defend a indefensible man.

Conversely, we admire @Acosta because everyday he puts on his rain boots and rakes through the mud and crud of this administration to give us the truth.

This is hilarious! The vote must have been swayed by the Russians!
Late April fools joke?
How can adults be this stupid and childish? I guess it’s contagious
Yuck!
Yay, Sara! You so deserve the accolades. I’m so surprised that Cher, supermodel-has-been turned fashion critic, didn’t make the list. You rock; it’s a pleasure to watch you take charge of the news animals. Celebrate!
@RedneckMischief @PressSec @Acosta she's a heck of a lady. I know you are proud
She’s da bomb. She has a scorched earth policy when it comes to Fake News.
Sarah rocks #trump2020maga

Bravo Bravo MikeHuckabee you should be so proud of Sarah! She does a awesome job!
I love your daughter! Beautiful, strong and smart! You did an awesome parenting job!
I like Sara Sanders I love her little  cute southern accent I like hearing her speak
Well done and she definitely earned it. Congratulations @PressSec!! 
Sarah like you Mike, will go down in history as a well oiled lying machine. Sad really that this is what the GOP has become.
Congratulations Sarah...you do an amazing job keeping those MSM idiots in line and representing our POTUS, while being a Mom (an already full-time job x4)
