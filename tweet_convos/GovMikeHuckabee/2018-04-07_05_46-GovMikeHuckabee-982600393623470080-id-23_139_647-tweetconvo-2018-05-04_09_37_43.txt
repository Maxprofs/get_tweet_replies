I knew there was a reason nobody talks about her anymore.
Thank you so much for Jo Dee Messina and that new song "GREATER THAN THIS" I sure hope it gets out to the stations esp. Klove!!!!
Does it drown you out? Because that's my first requirement of music.
Thanks for posting your guest list so we real Americans know who not to support. #TrumpsPissBoy
Wow amazing
Ok. Time to throw out JoDee cds.  Kind of sad but I’ll get over it pretty quick.
Wow!! I was blown away on the song she sang!
Watching...great show with Jo Dee Messina...
Looking forward to watching I going to DVR it <3
I hope you go straight to hell for supporting Trump. Meanwhile, we are going to file a class action suit against you for hate speech, MN-GLAAD.
Love you Jo Dee
Love the Rick’ but figured you more for a Fender Jazz. Old dudes rock.
Lame!
Huckelberry ...you never got the chicks while trying to be a guitar player in Jr. High....what makes you think it will be any different now???????????????

Sounds like a great Plan GOV Huckabee! If WE can't keep OUR open? WE have a 2nd chance on SUN EVE, and the show is also recorded on our DVR! Join the fun watching TBN too America!
