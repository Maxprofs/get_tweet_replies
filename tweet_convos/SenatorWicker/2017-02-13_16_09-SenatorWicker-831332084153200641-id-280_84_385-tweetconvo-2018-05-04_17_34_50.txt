You must be so proud of the new swamp monsters joining the repubs. The stink, tho.
Merrick Garland much?
Why not just report he was confirmed? You delayed stuff for 8 DAMN YEARS! #SoPetty #StopSupportingTheOppressor
Great news, everybody. Stevie can get right to work at Making Predatory Loaning Great Again!
can't wait to see how fast we go back to 2008,maybe I'll lose the house this time
SICK.
You are quite literally the last person on the planet to have the right to say anything about delays in the Senate.
Remember: YOU'll b held responsible 4 every 1 of these ridiculous confirmations
Ditch Mitch soon. Worst and most corrupt leader ever.
disasters all of them.  I want independent investigation on ties to russia. take a Viagra and stand up to trump.
,  it's called doing their job. Something you forgot to do kissing trumps ars..
blah blah mumble mumble compromise mumble govern mumble mumble wife got job mumble
Whatever it takes. Dems can participate or get run over. Their choice.
Add some more to the Swamp.  It's keeps getting deeper!  Disgraceful
if trump had nominated folks who filled out their paperwork and were ethical and honest they would have sailed through

Like you did with the last Supreme Court nomination? Hypocrisy at it's finest!
perhaps you are realizing delays may be a good thing or are you OK w/lies in NSA?
If I had such crap to choose from I'd drag my tail too. Actually I credit them-nominees are horrendous! You should be ashamed
Who cares?!? DO YOUR JOB. INVESTIGATE FLYNN ACT OF TREASON WHEREVER IT LEADS!!
Hope they work out better than FLYNN did! Liars everywhere!
Is delaying bad? Cause...you know...Judge Garland.
God bless us all now.
Oh stop it! No one stone walled like you and the republicans did for past 8 yrs.
Got that right.
#dumpsterfire
Repubs are beginning to see the light. Things are going to change. Stay on the boat, Mitch!
lol, NSA Director you vouched for resigned in disgrace. Still worried about delays
you have no room to talk about delays, PERIOD! #MerrickGarland
don't know about delay?But hopefully extreme vetting. Especially after Flynn.
You off all people have no right to talk @SenateMajLdr
Delay!?! How dare you talk about delay? #MerrickGarland
McConnell is the DC swamps greatest hypocrite..8 yrs nothing but obstructionist to Obama. Un-American, unpatriotic liar
You're all a bunch of CROOKS! IMPEACH TRUMP Russian ties!! He knew what Flynn did
maybe if they had been properly vetted first there'd be less delay, you dog fart.
you blocked a consensus #SCOTUS nominee for almost a year.  You have destroyed how the Senate functioned.  Be ashamed.
your boldfaced hypocrisy is getting old
Thx for your hard work & tireless efforts in these confirmation hearings.  It feels like you're a trusted leader for America!
@Headerop1 @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs #Delay #Resist #Obstruct, then do it again.
first resignation from Donald GoldenSwamp tonight - facts Mitch facts
Please get the smirk off of your face and handle the Trump/Russian affair!!
@Headerop1 @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs Save it, this administration is a total joke.
I try to only read your tweets while I poo
@Headerop1 @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs why not? Shulkin's a nonVet leading VA, DeVos non educator in PS..#maga
and this makes you proud. Why?
perhaps if paperwork you demanded for Obama's candidates was fine things wouldn't take so long
No idea why they'd be delaying things Mike Flynn just resigned in disgrace
@realDonaldTrump U brought this on urselves. Kick Obama, Dems kick back. Yay!
Delay, that's funny after what you did to Obama.
leave the delay part out of your tweet. #MerrickGarland
Please quit bashing and appreciate steps forward
Ew.
Another bad decision by you, turtle face!
time for "We the People" drain the swap since your man can't.
go clean house..
VOTE NO ON SECRETARY OF LABOR
Power over Purpose?
Don't think they delayed Shulken for @DeptVetAffairs (vote was 100:0), but Mnuchin is terrible choice.
That is really funny coming from the master obstructionist. #HYPOCRITE #YOUSUCK
the repubs shut down the goverment because they had sand in their vagina
and were bound and determined to legislate mine!
Mortgage meltdown has begun. Healthcare gone Mortgage gone. The rich get richer poor get poorer!
Liar. Hypocrite. Trump enabler. Fascist puppet.
Given Flynn, maybe they should have stalled more and saved your embarrassment!
@SenatorWicker @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs #HeKnew #Flynn #LoganAct #ThisIsYourOut #Impeach #DoTheRightThing
Get that goofy grin off your face! Democrats held the Senate hostage thanks to you
@krallenstanges A delay you say? Imagine if they stated their only goal was to stop you from doing anything for 4 years....
@SenatorWicker @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs Munchin disgusting choice.  The swamp will be drained.
are you seriously complaining about Delays? You?
@SenatorWicker @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs GOP shameful on Mnuchin. You all have short-term memories.
Booo
@SenatorWicker @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs.  Lets get Dr. Carson in HUD!  Great job.  Keep it up
You old GOAT. Where were you when Obama was obstructed? DID U have a hand in that?
Can we expect a vote on Merrick Garland for #SCOTUS sometime soon then, since you profess to dislike delays so much?
what about the rest of the munchkins!!!???
Vets will rise up if they are cast aside again #greatoptics #assholes
lost all respect for you & GOP. Who bought you out? #notmyrepublicanparty
great pick - you drained the swamp and look what was left, another ethics violation from GS
corrupt cabinet.
@McConnellPress @SpeakerRyan 
Another Swamp Creature joins the moss-infested Swamp
eat shit Mitchy Poo.
Well, it's a no brainer when you pick the right people for the job.
and our country continues toward its very sad demise!  You creeps
too bad no republicans had any backbone to oppose
I would take the swamp over the Russian Cesspool any day #2018 #DumpMitch
You know we still remember you begging for Bailouts Mitch. It wasn't that long ago
We learned about obstruction from you Mitch.
I am surprised you can type and use Twitter -- must be hard with no spine.
was that a tough delay? were the dems unfair to you precious? you shameless  cog
oh thank we were worried. All hail Senator C. Montgomery Burns
More broken trump promises as ex Goldman Sachs Wall Street insider arrives.
please refrain from bashing dems   When the GOP has become a fascist regime
- lets get our president his cabinet. It is embarrassing to have this many holes.
Another Goldman Sachs addition in effort to drain swamp. NOT what @POTUS promised!
Why is it OK that @POTUS allowed pics of the guy that holds the nuclear football
Feel proud of your behavior! You guys are a shame for our country!
party before country.
Thank goodness;you would have never done the same had the election outcome been http://different.Now  about Michael Flynn...

Imagine! Senators delaying. I'm shocked, shocked! ...
: MAGA
wealthy Demogogues.  My grandma on the street thanks u
you sure are a whiny toady.
and the white supremacist, con artist, circle jerk continues...fantastic.
You have ZERO room to ever use the word "delay." Snake.
After 'advice and consent' from Senate Dems. "Delay" would apply to J. Garland.
it must feel good to accomplish just about anything when you are an invertebrate functioning on land.
such smarmy hypocrisy. You spent the last 8 years obstructing everything. Everyone remembers and sees you for what you are.
Hey, let's talk Flynn and Russia!!!!!
that you voted for them shows how little you care about the people you are supposed to represent.
and you will continue to be the unethical, hypocrite who is bringing disgrace to our democracy.
Demwits dragging their butts on the carpet again!
so why did it take all this time, every confirmation had had same vote #s. Delay?
. When are you going to help those miners get their pensions.  They're going to need that money.
you say that like it's a good thing for the American people. You are disappointing
nominate competent people and you wouldn't see delays
disgraceful
after a block by senate GOP, Americans screwed out of moderate Merrick Garland.
.. just doing the due diligence of going through the hearing process...Like you'd know about that
#DefeatDems2018  #Childish,  #VindictiveDems are foot dragging.
You can't EVER speak of delays #MerrickGarland #hypocrites #CorruptGOP
McConnell doesn't know it but trump is rendering congress irrelevant
When the economy crashes again it's on your head @GOP this admin will be death
DITCH MITCH

Thank you Senate Dems for your integrity! Winter is coming. #DoYourJob #FireFlynn
really... dems delayed? Merrick Garland ring a bell?
disgusting
it's about time.

What about the R delays that deprived Merrick Garland his rightful consideration?

Good News - and congratulations to all confirmed 
YOU MAKE YOUR CONSTITUENTS SICK @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @SenJohnBarrasso @POTUS

Why is Trump spending so much time at mar-a-lago? Where is healthcare? Jobs? Fail, Sad @SenateMajLdr  @HouseGOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
pay to play.I don't ever want to hear your racist rants against dems again!
Two more nightmarish picks that sheepish @GOP roll over to. Excellent. @SenateMajLdr @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @DeptVetAffairs
White Supremacist on Trump staff you say nothing.  Time for your old asp to retire
There you go again with your childish taunting of Dems for doing the same thing the GOP did for the last 8 years. You S.O.B.

do you think we're stupid?
You have the audacity to talk about delays? @GOP has such a short memory.Reminder: what goes around comes around. #VoteThemOut
@EllenMorris1222 @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury  I'm a 62-year-old woman. Not a doubt in my mind, y'all are trying to kill me.
Hey when wall street pays you big kick backs you would confirm the devil
By the way what about those coal miner pensions? #liar #ditchmitch #crookedmitch #hypocrisy
