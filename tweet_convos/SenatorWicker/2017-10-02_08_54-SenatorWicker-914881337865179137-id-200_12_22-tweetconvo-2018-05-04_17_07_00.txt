Lovely and I'm sure heartfelt words, but when will they be followed by responsible action?
Is this the statement $88,000 from the NRA buys? #GunContolNow #LasVegas
Just bury your head in the sand & try to distract us by talking about the tax cuts you want to give the rich. That won't work this time.
There is no healing here senator. your platitudes are hollow! your prayers will save none of us from semi automatic bullets- very sad
Return your blood money to @NRA
where's the courage to stand up to the NRA and change gun laws in the face of this tragedy? #enough
YOUR WORDS MEAN NOTHING UNTIL U STOP TAKING CASH FROM THE NRA & VETOING SENSIBLE GUN LAWS, BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS. SHAMEFUL HYPOCRITE.
Means nothing coming from the guy who accepted $90k from the NRA. We know whom you serve.
How can you sleep at night? You’re a terrible person, and all you care about is your personal gain.
What if your family happened to be at a concert & this happened? Would you still not care about stopping these crazy people from killiing?
Maybe stop taking money from the fucking NRA and ban assault rifles?! Your thoughts and prayers aren’t doing shit.
No need to search for answers. I have it: #GunContolNow . Time for responsible gun control legislation is long overdue.
thoughts and prayers don't protect the next INNOCENT victim of gun violence. You stand by and give this tacit approval.  SHAME
You have zero credibility on this issue. Until you return NRA blood money, you are complicit in every mass murder in the U.S.
#GiveItBack

Empty words, sir, with no evidence that you truly care about people's lives and are willing to stand up for them. It's shameful.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
And what are you going to do about gun control? The victims' blood is on YOUR hands if you don't enact stricter gun laws. Outlaw automatics
Very happy to see you’re being ripped to shreds here. 
#Shame on you.  Karma is a bitch dude. 
Sending your heart to the dead does not bring them back to life. Donate your @NRA $$ to @Everytown Roger
Prayers are not enough, change the gun laws. You accepted donations from the NRA.  You have blood on your hands.
Your constituents wish you would do more to ensure their safety than just pray for and grieve with them.
Give back the blood money you took from the NRA
how do any of you sleep at night? these deaths are directly related to laws you enacted.
Shut your face until you do something about gun control.
Your thoughts and prayers are worth nothing. Action changes the future. Or do you need more $$ from the NRA for a car payment or something?
You can dry your tears with the NRA checks, can't you?
My "thoughts and prayers" go out to YOU, @SenatorWicker. May God give you the balls to stand up to the @NRA! You're not paid to pray!
Shame!

Every Member of Congress Who Took Money From the NRA and Tweeted 'Thoughts and Prayers' to Las Vegas @splinter_news http://ow.ly/9SsB30fAAVY 
.@SenatorWicker took $88,406+ from @NRA so he'll offer condolences, but won't act to reduce gun violence
 #SendBackTheBloodMoney

Give back the $$$$ have you no conscience  ?
You have no fucking right to your useless prayers and thoughts. Blood is on your hands.
send the blood money back to NRA you fool
I have a priest whose job is praying. Your job is passing gun control legislation. Do your job! Jesus weeps for your hypocritical prayers.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney 
Return campaign donations from the @NRA
Nice statement. Rendered empty and meaningless unless you #ReturnTheBloodMoney
1 answer would be to refuse NRA campaign funds and support even ONE- measure to contain gun violence. Spare me your crocodile tears.
The NRA is a lobbying arm of the gun industry AND a domestic terrorist organization.
BS
You took $88,000 from the NRA.  Give it back.  Their money is bad money.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney nobody wants your crocodile tears and #thoughtsandprayers you @NRA wonk
Words mean NOTHING! DO SOMETHING!!! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
@SenatorWicker - @RogerWicker  - NO PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY NEEDS AN AUTOMATIC RIFLE. - Do something about gun violence by controlling guns!
$88,406 you corrupt shill
How much money do you take from @NRA ?
Time to do something about the carnage! #SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you contributed to this shooting by taking the NRA’s money and doing NOTHING to work towards stricter gun laws.
Send back the blood money you took from the NRA.
joins you in prayer. Send back the money, vote down the gun silencer bill #SendBackTheBloodMoney
What about the despicable evil of accepting NRA money to increase the likelihood of this type of event?
"Republicans" = gun lobby. If Sandy Hook didn't change your fetish with unfettered gun access, nothing will.
Nothing will change until you pass common sense gun control legislation. How much blood money did you take from the @NRA?
Why even be a senator if you have no interest in doing your job and helping people? Your (in)actions speak louder than your words.
I mean, you must not care that much if you're fine accepting money from the @NRA and literally never doing anything to address this.
You took 88k from the @NRA, a domestic terror org. Give the $ back and pass legislation to end gun terror in the U.S..
#TerrorismbyNRA

Condolences won't fix anything.  Send back the blood money from the NRA, and vote for common sense gun regulations.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
Here's an idea: ban massive assault weapons.
Sarcasm "fake news"?
"Our thoughts & prayers are with the families & victims of this tragedy. Our votes, policy and cashflow are with the @NRA." - @SenateGOP
Our blood is on your hands.
shill for the NRA... sold your soul...
ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE NOT FOR SELF DEFENSE, THEY WERE INVENTED FOR WAR AND NOTHING ELSE
You are an accessory to mass murder: http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Roger_Wicker_Gun_Control.htm …
You accepted money from gun industry at time of voting: $21,350. #hypocrisy
Accomplice. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You took $88K from NRA. Praying won't solve the problem. You are an accomplice, not a solution.
You forgot to mention the $88,400.00 you took from the @NRA - #LasVegas
Empty. Hollow. Complicit. #GunControl
REMINDER: 41 Republicans blocked sensible gun legislation, right after the Sandy Hook Massacre.

#LasVegas #LasVegasMassacre #GunControlNow 
save us your #thoughtsandprayers, #SendBackTheBloodMoney and get to work on #GunControlNow
You take NRA blood money. STOP with the meaningless platitudes.  You are COMPLICIT.
I guess all their lives are worth the 88k you got from the NRA. #sendbackthebloodmoney
Another impotent senator who does nothing about assault weapons of mass destruction
Stuff prayers. Put thoughts into action to stop this madness. Otherwise, you're a coward who values money and power over people's lives.
Finally. We've been waiting on your prayers. I'm glad you're finally committed to action to combat all of these mass shootings.
Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
#GiveBacktheBloodMoney
#GunControlNow Stop being sad & make legislation happen. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
.@SenatorWicker took $88,406+ from @NRA so he'll offer condolences, but won't act to reduce gun violence

Urge him to #SendBackTheBloodMoney
You have taken over $88K from the NRA. Your sentiments ring hollow and insincere.
How much fucking $$$ have you taken from the NRA?
I understand you're $88,000+ in to the NRA. I'd say you helped fund this tragedy, no matter how your heart aches. #NRATerrorist
I’d love some answers fr you if not I will campaign against you to get a dem in your seat
Are you a senator to get $ fr lobbyists or to do the right thing for the constituents of your state? Give back the $ don’t be controlled
Thoughts and prayers are empty. Period. #StopTheNRA and their hold on congress. Follow the $$$
Should we even bother to ask you to vote in favor of net neutrality? Or CHIP?
We don't have to search for answers. You and the rest of the Congress knows the answers. Just look at other democracies in the world.
Your prayers are worthless. You took blood money from the NRA. Ban machine guns, or stop pretending you care about murder more than the NRA
#SendBackTheBloodMoney Senator Wicker, if you care about families in #LasVegas
Return the $89K in blood money from the @NRA and be a leader.
God wants you to reject the NRA. when will you understand that lives matter more than money? will you ever care?
You sure like that NRA money though.
Blood on your hands.
Spare us the empty words, your hands are dirty with NRA money. This is your fault. Go apologize to victims.
@SenatorWicker evokes his god and offers prayers, but will he work to pass sane gun regulations? Nothing else matters.
Fuck your thoughts and prayers. You took blood money from the NRA. This is on you.
Sex workers have more ethics than you. Hope that NRA spends nice.
You took $88k in blood money from the @NRA . Your party aims to defund #mental #health care. Until you #BanAssaultWeapons you are #complicit
Weapons of mass destruction didn't always exist.
Roger, legislation makes a bigger difference than claiming the act was senseless.
This blood is on your hands. You took the @NRA money and you are culpable.
NRA Blood Money! 
You are a domestic terrorist! You allow this to happen!
cool so what laws and regulations will you enact to ensure this never happens again?
Why don't you offer effective gun control policies instead? Your words are hypocrisy soaked in the filthy lucre of your gun lobby donors.
Thoughts & prayers don't really do much. Do you bathe in your #NRAbloodmoney? Here's a country song - a little less talk & a lot more action
Here's an idea:  Don't support the Share Act, which will deregulate silencers, which are needed for what legitimate reason, anyway?
Your cheap sentiment while rolling in almost $90K of NRA money is duly noted.
.@SenatorWicker took $88,406+ from @NRA so he'll offer condolences, but won't act to reduce gun violence. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Keep your thoughts and prayers. Do something. Work on meaningful gun control legislation. Do something that actually saves lives
Wow $88K from gun lobby. Good idea taking blood money rather than protecting your constituents.
You enable murders like this by preventing healthcare for the mentally ill, and when you cater to @NRA and focus on foreign bogeymen instead
You voted against the assault weapons ban. 
Your words mean nothing.
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
#SendBackTheBloodMoney you received from the NRA Senator
Shame on u. Save your thoughts and prayers
I'd rather see your bank statement detailing the 88k you got from the NRA
Stuff your statement, do something

How's about you return the $88,406 you received from the @NRA? Does that come with automatic thoughts and prayers? @igorvolsky
Use your @NRA blood money to pay for funerals

You have over $88,000 worth of @NRA blood money on your hands that will NEVER wash off! #GUNCONTROLNOW
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You took almost $100K of blood money from the NRA. You have blood and on your hands and your words mean nothing. #SendBackTheBloodMoney
.@SenatorWicker took $88,406+ from @NRA so he'll offer condolences, but won't act to reduce gun violence
#SendBackTheBloodMoney
You do recall taking $88,400+ from @NRA, yes? As you "search for answers," how about rejecting gun-lobby $$ and passing smart legislation?
Give back the NRA money and enact life-saving legislation. Otherwise, it's on you.
We need sensible gun legislation.
DO SOMETHING #SendBackTheBloodMoney
Your statement rings empty as you sit back and take blood money from the NRA.
Hi Senator! How goes it this morning? Not good huh? Bummer.That 88k from the NRA doesnt help? Your heart goes out to them tho so all good.
DO SOMETHING.
Was that sweet sweet @NRA money worth it, buddy?
You took money from the NRA, the blood of those that were killed and injured in Vegas is on your hands
America has a gun problem. You are part of it.
Why aren't you busy taking NRA donations, undermining states' rights for gun control and rolling back whatever regulations we have left?
Americans want #GunControlNow
How nice you took the time to write a nice note of condolence. When will you get the next check from the NRA? Don't pray. DO SOMETHING!
You took money from the NRA and stand in the way of gun control. This is your fault.
You took $88,000 from the NRA. This blood is all over your hands.
I 1:15 Whn u spread out ur hands in prayer I hide my  from u even when u offer many prayers I am not listening ur hands are full of blood!
Their blood is on your hands.
88,406 dollars.
How about you work to take assault weapons designed for military combat OUT OF THE HANDS OF CIVILIANS? Be a leader for USA  fr MS for once
Can I get a response sir? Let’s quit trophy hunting and killing people using assault weapons. Require mandatory background checks on every1
You took $ from NRA- give back the blood money and legislate gun control! Now! Please!
How much does each of your words worth in #NRA money? What we need are fewer easy-peasy platitudes, more #GunControlNow
You and your disgusting Republican buddies OWN the Las Vegas shooting, Roger. And you want the next shooter to have a silencer, too.
Thoughts & prayers mean nothing without acting now to prevent mass shootings. 
We demand more comprehensive gun control now.
Your vote against reasonable gun control measures after #SandyHook was reprehensible. 
Time to correct it.
How about you #SendBackTheBloodMoney to the NRA? Actions speak a lot louder than words
The blood money from the NRA makes it so you stop at condolences. You'll mever wash the blood clean from your hands.
Empty words after the money you took from the nra bought your approval
#SendBackTheBloodMoney  DO YOUR JOB!  Save lives & fight against the lies & fake messages the @NRA sends out!~
#LessPrayingMoreDoing
But your bribes from the NRA are still there so nothing will happen.
There is blood on your hands.
I don't see anything in there about gun control. Maybe you missed it?

You'll pray, send thoughts, hope it can be dealt with, lower flags, and DO NOTHING. Always the same, people die, NRA wins.
Insanely stupid to claim NRA has anything to do with what's happened. This is a mind & heart thing. #StopBeingAVictim
