@SenatorWicker You have failed the American people and your electorate. Shame on you.
@DeirdreS @SenatorWicker he sure didn't fail me, or my buddies, or my family...and WE vote
@drrik Seems you are in a minority even in the NRA. Please consider an option that protects your rights, but also others' safety.
@DeirdreS  Since I participate in NRA activities, how do you become so in touch with my peers? Today's vote had nothing to do with "safety"
@drrik You haven't answered my question: how would background checks discommode you, a law-abiding citizen? What's your skin in this game?
@SenatorWicker you are a disgrace to this country.  Shame on you.
@SenatorWicker Shameful and disgraceful. #lackofleadership
@SenatorWicker Thanks for voting no on gun control. Let's keep it about Crime control.
@Brantre123 @SenatorWicker is that a UFO over your head?
@SenatorWicker stands against the will of the People & sides with @nra to protect terrorists & criminals to have unfettered access to guns
@SenatorWicker shame on you for choosing the gun lobby over 90% of Americans - you make a sham of our system - disgusting
Huh? Please explain. “@SenatorWicker: Press Release: Wicker Opposes Expanded Background Checks. Read more here: http://www.elyrics.net/read/t/ted-nugent-lyrics/cat-scratch-fever-lyrics.html …”
@SenatorWicker if 20 dead 6 year olds doesn't make you do the right thing, then I have no use for you. SHAME ON YOU.
@SenatorWicker  #NRA increased $$$ to @GOP after #SandyHook. How much per dead child did you get? We will remember. #stoprush #demandAction
@eurekasue49 @senatorwicker @gop Ah, they pay per dead child? no wonder they defended rights of terrorists, felons & rapists to have guns.
@sheelaraja @senatorwicker @gop Yeah, Dem Sen signaled they might chng vote. NRA: "We'll make sure that doesn't happen." #OFA #DemandAction
@SenatorWicker Money makes your world go round, and pays for your seat.
@SenatorWicker YOU SIR ARE A COWARD!!!!!!!!!!
@SenatorWicker Yeah, how would a background check harm you? An why not let people with guns into the Capitol? You think it's fine for us.
@SenatorWicker  Try to read the Constitution with the perspective of one not beholden to the NRA.  Now do you "get it"?  No?  Keep trying.
@SenatorWicker YOU COULD USE SOME OF THE COURAGE THAT OUR FOLKS IN BOSTON SHOWED THIS WEEK..YOU REPRESENT YOUR OWN INTEREST, NOT OURS. SHAME
@SenatorWicker How interesting that 90% of us want checks but you feel OBLIGATED to the NRA to Oppose US. Hmmm.
@SenatorWicker Hang your head in shame!
@SenatorWicker Anyone can walk in a gun show and walk out with an assault rifle.
@SenatorWicker yeah so this https://twitter.com/senatorwicker/status/279643916540710912 … meant nothing really?
As news continues to unfold about the horrific shooting at a school in Connecticut, my prayers are with the families & first responders.
@SenatorWicker You’re worried about a national gun registry? Don’t you know one already exists? Ask the data miners. Shame on you, senator.
@SenatorWicker Shame on you.
@SenatorWicker You represent the NRA not your constituents!  We will vote you OUT no matter how much money the NRA gives you!!!
@SenatorWicker So disappointed! Our children are watching & learning that the NRA matters more than their safety & well being.#2ndAmendment
@SenatorWicker Shame on you. #RememberNewtown
@SenatorWicker "..could have opened the door to national registry.." OR you could have closed the door on criminals obtaining guns. #liar
@SenatorWicker Yet another #Maine #baby @ high risk of #trafficking by #pedophile ring http://www.scribd.com/doc/136328417/Second-wife-baby-of-abusive-Maine-dad-flee-file-for-divorce … #savemila's half-sister!
@SenatorWicker For shame. Remember the 90%.
@SenatorWicker you should be ashamed of yourself
@SenatorWicker You are a coward and a liar. You placed the comforts of your office above your country and the safety of its citizens.
@SenatorWicker as well he should oppose them!!!
@SenatorWicker Something to be proud of? Can't wait to hear how you're praying for the victims of the next mass shooting. @MomsDemand
@SenatorWicker You are a disgrace.
@SenatorWicker What sort of human being proudly announces in a press release that he has an A+ rating from the #NRA for his voting record?
@SenatorWicker have you no conscious or are you ignorant?
@SenatorWicker your opposition is written in the blood of children.
@SenatorWicker You're a disgrace.  What a phony "representative" you and your ILK are.  You have shown your true colors.
@SenatorWicker Grow a backbone. You are better than this and our children deserve better. EPIC FAIL.
@SenatorWicker do you keep a magnifying glass on your zipper to find your balls, or do you have a team of gnats hired for the job?
@SenatorWicker amazing! You did such great work representing the best interests of our country!! #wtf #fail #really?????
@SenatorWicker It is too easy for criminals to get guns. http://nyti.ms/17215tM   You voted against the American people. #demandaplan
@SenatorWicker You are a coward carrying water for the NRA!
@SenatorWicker glad I left Mississippi as you don't represent me. You are a coward
@SenatorWicker <-- Big #FAIL
@SenatorWicker  A shameful day for Washington, and for you,  personally. Guess you can comfort future gun victims with your NRA rating.
@SenatorWicker Shame on you Senator 4 choosing #GunsOverPeople to protect your #NRAbloodmoney rating. #GunControlSavesLives #NewtownBetrayed
@SenatorWicker & most of ur country opposes u. Such a selfish coward. Use some common sense!!!
@SenatorWicker WHY???  90% of Americans WANT background checks!  Your vote was for the gun manufacters/NRA. #disgusting
@SenatorWicker   SHAME ON YOU .............................................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SenatorWicker received $13,350 in campaign contributions from the #NRA in 2008 & 2012. http://ow.ly/kaPTz  #puppyloveforNRA #NRALapdogs
@SenatorWicker BOOOOOOOO!!
@SenatorWicker My background check on your vote shows you failed. I will financially support the next person to run against you.
@SenatorWicker You are a total disgrace to America. May your "vote" haunt you forever
@SenatorWicker 93% of gun households, 89% of Republicans & 85% of NRA member households support universal background checks. #badatyourjob
@SenatorWicker shame on u4 voting no! Enjoy blood of innocent people on your hands! #MomsDemandAction #GunSense http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/opinion/a-senate-in-the-gun-lobbys-grip.html?_r=0 …
@SenatorWicker Shame on you.
“@SenatorWicker: Press Release: Wicker Opposes Expanded Background Checks. 
I'm JV, and 90% of us don't approve your message. #BoughtByNRA
@SenatorWicker You and all your colleagues who voted "No" today have betrayed the American public in favor of moneyed self-interest.
@SenatorWicker We should do a background check on all "no" vote senators. You'd fail, I'm certain, just as you failed Sandy Hook children.
@SenatorWicker You are a disgrace to the nation -- a shameful and cowardly public servant.
@SenatorWicker shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame shame
@SenatorWicker You are a disgrace, whose vote protects only criminals and the gun lobby, not the 2nd amendment.
Shame on you @SenatorWicker
@SenatorWicker #gunlobbywhore
@SenatorWicker Re: No vote on extended  BG checks. You just spit on 90% of America.
@SenatorWicker and ur proud of that?! Ur a traitor and the blood wont wash off that NRA money
@SenatorWicker So you're okay w/measures to keep YOU & YOUR family/staff safe from violent criminals but NOT for the American people, right?
@SenatorWicker This is the most nonsensical amendment to oppose when 90% of American support this! Lunacy.
@SenatorWicker And how would you have voted if one of your children or grandchildren was killed in the Connecticut massacre?
@SenatorWicker Thanks for voting for the NRA and the gun manufacturers today against the overwhelming will of the people. SHAME SHAME SHAME
. @SenatorWicker SHAME! You chose #GunsOverPeople today.
@SenatorWicker Guns don't kill people. People kill people. Killers should be held accountable for their actions, not their weapons.
