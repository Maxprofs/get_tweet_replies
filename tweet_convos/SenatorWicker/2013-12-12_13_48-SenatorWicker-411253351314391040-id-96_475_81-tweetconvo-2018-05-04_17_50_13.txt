@PolitiFact  BS. NOT A LiIE. oversimplification. " if your insurance company doesn't cancel your plan you can keep it". Happy? #idiots
@CecilyKeating @PolitiFact  I like mine and have kept it as have most. Everyone now has the RIGHT to get  insured. Not before the ACA.
@Maggyw519 @PolitiFact exactly, Maggy! I am v angry at Politifact for calling POTUS' statement a "lie" . It wasn't.
@CecilyKeating @PolitiFact do you know they let people VOTE, this was not based on facts, just propaganda.
@Maggyw519 @PolitiFact they said decision was made by them -vote just agreed w them. I am v pissed off.
@CecilyKeating @PolitiFact I am too. POTUS did not lie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
@Maggyw519 @PolitiFact    He certainly didn't. Shame on Politifact.
@CecilyKeating @PolitiFact should be "the most well publicized SMEAR" of the year.
Agreed @PolitiFact: Our #LieOfTheYear for 2013 is Obama’s if you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Story: http://bit.ly/1bIzuBy 
@PolitiFact lie? You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means. #Inconceivable Taken IN CONTEXT it was not a lie.
@PolitiFact @RepShimkus Yo Shimkus! "The Republic of Korea" is an American ally, known as South Korea. They not being difficult to talk to!

@PolitiFact @AdamBaldwin If you like your doctor you can kiss your doctor goodbye.
@AdamBaldwin what's significant about this is @Politifact was aiming at a lot of Republicans. And they hated this lie the most. 4 gd reason.
@PolitiFact @AdamBaldwin your lie of the year that didn't even register a blip earlier in the year when you called it part true?
.@PolitiFact You’re the liars. Please find something to do that you’re actually good at.

@PolitiFact @McConnellPress where were u before the election?
.@PolitiFact @mattyglesias The article says the insurance companies changed the plans so they weren't grandfathered. That wasn't Obama.

@PolitiFact Come on!! Don't you think the biggest lie came from Mitch McConnell when he said "We have been very fair with President Obama. "
So basically @PolitiFact is trying to appear credible again before the need to distort the truth for the next election. #StillHacks

@PolitiFact Sooooo last year you said it was true And now it's the #LieOfTheYear?.You haven't a shred of credibility. And THAT'S the truth.
@PolitiFact But it wasn't even a finalist and you still have it rated Half True: http://www.politifactbias.com/2013/12/the-politifact-lie-of-year-conspiracy.html?m=0 …
@PolitiFact @PolitiFactTexas You don't expect people to like a health plan that does nothing for you and can still bankrupt you if sick...
@PolitiFact So unsurprising that folks who think there is such a thing as "half true" or "mostly false" would not know that lie = intent
@PolitiFact you need a link to all the past lie of the year winners...or I just can't find the link

@PolitiFact blah... less a Lie than a short reply to a fearmongering accusation that "EVERYONE WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH INS!!!" #p2 #obamacare
@PolitiFact Only if you accept that if you had NO HEALTH PLAN you could 'keep it'...and clearly that wasn't the idea. Standards set. Trolls.
@PolitiFact @PolitiFactTexas I guess Jesus IS White.
,@PolitiFact @elisefoley No, #media fail of the year. NOBODY took it literally at the time. Find me one journo who scrutinized it! None did!
@PolitiFact @elisefoley Calling this a lie is silly & disingenuous. We all knew exactly what POTUS meant. #sensationalized media
@PolitiFact NO! The lie of the year is  that #foxnews is a news outlet. Lol!
@PolitiFact Then you're morons.
@PolitiFact Your own credibility is questionable, given that Obama's statement was not a lie but a mistake, which he took steps to correct.
@PolitiFact Figures. Wasn't it the insurance companies? I guess your facts are sideways.
