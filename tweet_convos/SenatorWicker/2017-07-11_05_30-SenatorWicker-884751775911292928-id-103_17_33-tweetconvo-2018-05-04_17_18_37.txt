Yea because middle class 8s struggling we need more military. Government is idiotic
Trump has once again undermined the Sec of State and threatened North Korea. What are YOU doing about this?
#invokethe25thamendment  NOW!
What war are you fighting with 355 naval ships? 355 well-paid hackers would be far more effective at modern warfare and billions cheaper.
Agreed, what is the significance of this number? What capabilities don't exist in current fleet? What part of the seas don't we sail? How...
Sen. Wicker-POTUS needs people in Rep. party to speak out in his defense. The MSM, and liberals are using lies and deceit! He needs you! 
Bob , Senator Wicker has supported Trump since day one.  How about you showing your support for Senator Wicker.
He supported kasich
Why is building Warships and Tanks more of a priority rather than crmbling infastructure and inequality in this country? People before party
When yur mouth is moving your lying FCC run by a pro 1% dik like yourself is the problem w america.. Stop saying "for the American people"

#MISSISSIPPI, this is your daily reminder that your senators voted to destroy your healthcare.  #Vote2018 
Get out of Afghanistan and maybe we can talk about these.
weak and insecure men get off on inciting fear in others, really weak men stay quiet. real men defend those who are threatened.

You should put an official stance re White Supremacist & neo-Nazis growing in pur country. P.S. #ImpeachTrump
National Security & Revenue for the State
Senator, what's ur stance on #Charlottesville?

ROGER WICKER is a HUGE TRUMP SUPPORTER and does whatever Trump says....even if losing Medicaid would have resulted in a few of us dying
isn't that special
You live in Mississippi.  Why not worry about education and healthcare for your state?  Boats?  Someone has lost touch with reality.
Your state was second to last in education last year...but yeah..build more boats.
Roger Wicker, TRUMP"S BIGGEST SUPPORTER, is happy to tie his political future to Trumps. Always has a kind word for Trump.
#Trump says you're a fool ...Fox and Friends agrees
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
#Trump says you're a fool Fox and Friends says it's your fault ACA is the law of the land.
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......

That's My Senator & he is 100% correct!...Now get 'er done, congress!
(Tax reform & healthcare too, pls)
@chuckwoolery @crawfishaka @rtoberl
Sen.RogerWicker(R-MS)agreed.“We don’t mind the noise,”he saidofthe protesters,before adding that hedidn’t think they were stalling the bill.

You know what a bigger priority than a real yuge boat is? Answering your constituents' questions. You work for the people of #Mississippi 1/
#WeThePeople have questions- abt healthcare, Medicaid, taxes, infrastructure, environment. How about holding a Town Hall during recess? 2/
Or, you know, keep talking about big floaty boats. Maybe the rising sea level caused by global warming WILL make those a priority.

3/3
Is this more important than ensuring Mississippians can afford housing? Which will aid growth, education, health, economic development?
Gonna have to move and find jobs.  Mississippi just doesn't have the resources as others
BUILD THE WALL - SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP
#JusticeforVets
Whistleblower Tarref Simon needs help in bringing attention to the VA. https://twitter.com/refee00/status/880540730174967810 …
'Little stumbling block?!' Senator, you can either 1. defend AMERICA, or 2. defend TRUMP. Can't do both. Which will it be? #CountryOverParty
Your argument is faulty because Trump has equal # of enemies in both parties, and everyone with a high IQ knows it
Guess that leaves you out.
Pretty sure the national priority is to remove Trump from further harming our country.
Yeah, for room-temperature IQ Libtards!
Protect the health care of millions!  Poor children, the disabled and older people will lose out if health care not protected
Roger you are betraying your State by Killing thousands in your state on Medicaid  How long before they turn on you ??? Country over Party
Congress created socialist healthcare that is the largest expenditure in 2017 budget & borrows $1M a minute... Spending like drunken sailors
