@TGowdySC a bunch of lies to make Hillary look bad
Oh really? So tell us your version of the truth. Hopefully all your sources will tell the truth.
its on the record that Republicans refused funding for Embassies
prove it
Actually the proof was yours and you failed miserably
My proof?
The link to part I seems to be broken, btw.
Technical issue fixed!
This is not from The Onion. @HouseBenghazi
It's not an obsession, she was involved and caused 4 deaths, then lied about it. What part do you not understand?
You know who lied and caused the deaths of thousands of Americans? This guy!
Obama Clinton policies to leave a vacuum caused Benghazi. Read the facts, not fantasy.
wonder what these four would say...
Nothing. Dead men don't talk.
yeah but if they could, what do you think they would say. Keep in mind, security was lax in 2012
Hurry! Hillary is doing well! Keeping Hillary from being elected Pres is the essence of your role.
So you would be happy with this witch in the WH?
Hillary is a witch? BURN!
Okay anonymous person... Please tell me redeeming qualities of HRC.
@TGowdySC dude nobody cares anymore. You already blew your chance when you fail to ask Hillary any tough questions
I know you don't care that 4 Americans died on her watch. Tells me a lot about you as a so called American
Conflate much? Douche
@RepMarthaRoby here's a suggestion... Let's pass  gun legislation instead of spend taxpayer money on Benghazi old news
its important because the person who should of had a handle on the situation is running for pres
mistakes made but Clinton did not intentionally kill those people or would you rather have Trump LOL?
The @HouseBenghazi panel IS the scandal, @RepNewhouse . Wasted $millions on politically-motivated witch hunt: found NOTHING.
waste of tax payer money by republicans.  Why wasn't there hearings after 260 people died Beirut under Reagan?
@jasoninthehouse Your committee is a waste of my TAX dollars .knock it off already

@Jim_Jordan It was the three cowards that failed to defend the embassy to blame for Benghazi not Hillary.
Both #CNN and #MSNBC will come out and say Hillary should get a Medal for her Heroic Actions that night

@TGowdySC 
Thank you for all your hard work.
Money well spent in the honor of American Heroes! I will read every single word!
@PeterRoskam Stop wasting tax-payer money on your sham.  @GOPLeader already told us what this committee was about.
I hope American citizens will read the entire report and then make comments based on the entire content.
Schools,hospitals needs resources. $7 million tax dollars for a report. You can't measure, "She should have know." Who cares!
The White House insisted on no boots on the ground in keeping with their political objectives.
@TGowdySC #deflect Was this report worth $7,000,000 ?!?!  #liar #Trump2016 #Whinylittlebitch
@TGowdySC @kevinomccarthy opened his big mouth and told us why you did this. It's all a political sham.

.@TGowdySC got his ass handed to him by Hillary. The #BenghaziReport is paper to wipe shit off his face. @HouseBenghazi
Reading it http://benghazi.house.gov/NewInfo  Thank You for your work from all of U.S. http://www.teapartyfireants.net/benghazi-1.html 
@TGowdySC The desperation of the Republicans never ceases to amaze me.
I may be simplifying but didn't the terrorists kill these people? GOP agenda wasting time & $ as usual.
& Dems being so "transparent"...dragged it on...why did Obama say for weeks it was a video and that was not the cause
Wait... the Benghazi committee has a Twitter account?!  Why?  That's a little odd.
@TGowdySC this should be nonpartisan. They were AMERICANS!  Obama and Clinton blaming a video so he can be reelected. Jail!
If ur life as an American ws in danger & KILLARYS POLITCAL STNDING WS IN EQUAL DANGER  u wd be sht outta luck #NeverHillary
