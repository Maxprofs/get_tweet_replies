@SenatorWicker Why are you going to defend Obamacare? Do you just not like it when people are healthy?
@jcchurch @SenatorWicker it really has nothing at all to do with people being healthy
@travelinchick @jcchurch @SenatorWicker Obamacare is not about our heath it is about control
@mitigirl Oh, then what does the HealthCare bill attempt to do besides provide some healthcare to more people who need healthcare?
@jcchurch @mitigirl its a PreEmption to destabilize and dismantle the private system in order to Socialize healthcare.
@Nick_Whitener No. That is a factually incorrect statement for which you can provide no evidence.
@jcchurch Sen. Harry Reid Admitted to it.. The president admitted it and so has other sitting democratic Senators.
@Nick_Whitener Could you please tell me what these people admitted to? Do you have anything intelligent to say?
@SenatorWicker @D_Dunaway Reid will strip OUT the defund part so essentially you are voting to FUND #Obamacare
Please stand and speak @SenatorWicker @Sadiepunkin
