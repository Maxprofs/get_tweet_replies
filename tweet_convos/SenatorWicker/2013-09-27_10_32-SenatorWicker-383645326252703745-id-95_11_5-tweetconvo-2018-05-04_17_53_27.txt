@SenatorWicker From what I heard, you voted against. I heard that you and your other MS and TN cohorts did not vote for defunding. ;(
@SenatorWicker You voted for cloture! You've disenfranchised me as a voter and I won't forget this.
@SenatorWicker Of course you did, you're a conservative @GOP member.  #wwaad?
@SenatorWicker please explain how if you voted the same as Reid, then you were voting to stop the ACA?  I doubt his vote was to stop it?
@SenatorWicker You voted for cloture.  You guys give up the fight too easily.

@SenatorWicker On Obama care! IF IT IS NOT GOOD FOR ALL IT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANY ONE
@SenatorWicker your vote for cloture WAS a vote for Obamacare!  You no longer have my vote at election time. #MakeDCListen
@SenatorWicker AND I THOUGHT WE HAD CONSERVATIVES WHO LISTENED TO THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENTED...
@SenatorWicker   no,,, you voted to give harry reid the power to strip out the defund measure   YOU ARE SO BEING VOTED OUT OF OFFICE...
@SenatorWicker so then why did you vote for cloture?
@SenatorWicker you voted yes on cloture, but you want us to believe your vote of no on the bill to fund the goernment meant something, lol
@SenatorWicker meaningless! On the REAL vote you caved. You voted "yes" w/ @SenatorReid . YOU own Obamacare and the catastrophic results
@SenatorWicker did you vote the same way as Harry Reid?  If the answer is yes, then you did nothing to stop the ACA?
@SenatorWicker You are a disgrace. You don't represent your constituents! #DefundObamacare #MakeDCListen #StandWithCruz #OpSLAM #teaparty
@SenatorWicker @clearfieldking you are a LIER  you voted today to fund Obamacare , I hope this comes back to Bite you in the ASS !
@clearfieldking I'm sharing this on Facebook too
@SenatorWicker sir, u r incorrect and #WeThePeople r not blind, dumb or deaf.  Today u became a turn-coat disgracing the @GOP. #Fail
@SenatorWicker What U voted 4 was Cloture with Harry Reid & Obama.  Ur constituents R smart & will not forget. #Traitor
@SenatorWicker You voted with Democrats to allow Harry Reid to strip defunding Obamacare from the resolution. You lost my vote.
@SenatorWicker It's the other vote that disappoints me.
@SenatorWicker Confusing what you did today. It seems #Cochran did the same. #AffordableCareAct http://www.caintv.com/cr-passes-cloture-meet-the-rep …
@SenatorWicker you are a sell out.  Will not vote for you ever again.  Hope you have a primary opponent.  You are a #JUDAS
@SenatorWicker NEED SENATORIAL COMPETENCY TEST, CRUZ TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO CORKER,WHO JUST DIDN'T GET IT!! OMFG,WE HAVE IDIOTS IN CONGRESS

@SenatorWicker NO YOU DIDN'T!!! YOU VOTED YES ON CLOTURE WITH HARRY REID AND FUNDED OBAMACARE BY DOING SO!! LEARN WHAT CLOTURE MEANS!!!
@SenatorWicker actually with you voting for cloture you in essence voted for Obamacare. Trying to spin it any other way is disingenuous.
@SenatorWicker Extremely misleading!  Your vote to end debate was, in fact, a thumbs up vote for Obamacare! http://c.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/brenner-brief/2013/sep/27/full-list-senators-who-voted-cloture-fund-obamacar/ …
@SenatorWicker No Sir,You did NOT! Your playing political games. #MS is NOT a playground. Pathetic! http://www.theminorityreportblog.com/2013/09/27/list-of-republican-senators-who-voted-to-fund-obamacare/ … #rednationrising
@SenatorWicker I will not be voting for you in the future. That is all.
@SenatorWicker Yea , you voted just like harry reid told you to vote , you lost my vote though.
@SenatorWicker Do U think UR constituents are stupid?  U will find out how knowledgable we really R when U are defeated by a conservative!
@SenatorWicker
@SenatorWicker You are a liar. U voted to give Dems a 51 advantage. RU that stupid?We are not fooled. Show votes don't mean CRAP.  #TeaParty
@SenatorWicker why did you vote FOR cloture? #StandYourGround #MakeDCListen
@SenatorWicker is a CON! Votes FOR Cloture so @SenatorReid can strip #DefundObamacare w/51 votes & he can vote against that!
@SenatorWicker Thank the GOP for #GOPCare Republicans that voted for Cloture are full of hot air vote them out 2014
@SenatorWicker you voted for Statism, the people of MS will not forget,

@SenatorWicker We may be ignorant, but we ain't stupid. The cloture vote mattered today. And you know it.
.@SenatorWicker That was AFTER you voted YES on invoking cloture, which means that you voted YES on ACA. I am disappointed in you.
.@SenatorWicker Your constituents are smarter than you think. You voted FOR cloture w/ Harry Reid And Obama! We will not forget! #traitor
@SenatorWicker what's the catch why are your buddies voting for this?? This is wrong in so many ways and we will fight this
Count on it.
@SenatorWicker And is it true that that provision to defund it will be removed from the bill - that it is just a trick?
@SenatorWicker @toni_toniham Don't you know your constituents are smarter than that Senator? They know exactly what you allowed to happen.
Please @JJMCM123 go to @SenatorWicker acct n post ur response comment on his tweet for the world to see he is a RINO n traitor!
@SenatorWicker you voted today for cloture, allowing Harry Reid and his band of socialists to strip out the defunding. #MakeDCListen
@SenatorWicker thank you
@SenatorWicker You voted for cloture that will ensure #DefundObamaCare gets stripped from the CR & passed.  #weasel
@senatorwicker @toni_toniham  You are a PHONY PIECE OF TRIPE !!! DIctionary >> CLOTURE ! You are a Pathetic Phony ! #MakeDCListen !
@SenatorWicker You voted for closure. Your no better than Harry Reid or Obama himself.
@SenatorWicker 
-- no campaign contrib. 2 u from us thru RNC.  We will contribute directly to #teaparty candidates & vote in primaries.
@SenatorWicker You made your choice to stand with Harry Reid.  I WILL not vote for you next time and will work as hard as I can to get u out
@SenatorWicker read the retweets and post about your vote. Are you representing your constituents? Hopefully you won't be soon.
@SenatorWicker Your vote to end cloture lost you my vote. #PrimaryWicker
@SenatorWicker so your saying your voted "with" Harry Reid ? I hope you have someone running against you.
@SenatorWicker Voting for cloture was a defacto vote for #obamacare. #wewillremember
@SenatorWicker You "urge...." the President. Really? How about #StandWithCruz ? Oh, too late, you already sold that opportunity out.
@SenatorWicker you voted yes on cloture. You did not stand with @SenTedCruz. Im a taxpaying, voting Mississippian and we will remember.
@SenatorWicker No sir. You voted to end debate. You voted to give the majority a straight party line vote. Wonderful... Good grief....
@SenatorWicker I do not approve of your agenda.  This is ridiculous!  Do your job and stop crying about the ACA.
@calaumbach69 @SenatorWicker  we have to spread the word and make sure every voting, tax paying Mississippian knows it!
@SenatorWicker was it not amended to rip that out. You did not stand with Cruz nor I for you
@SenatorWicker Thank you for supporting the American People!
