@brithume Technically yes. But the rate on those $400k & up will under this law be higher than they were yesterday.
@CTrot35 No, this bill does not deal with the tax rates for those $400K and up. Their rates went up this a.m. under existing law.
@brithume Again, technically correct. By doing nothing on $400k+ those rates rise, a "sin of omission". Best bill that could be, I suppose.
@brithume You obviously don't get it that the bill has payroll tax hikes and ObamaCARE taxes go into effect today. #tcot #fauxsnooze
@exposeliberals The bill has no payroll tax hikes. The payroll tax cut was temporary and was set to expire by prior law.
@brithume and again, ObamaCARE taxes that went into effect today are raising taxes on everyone. That's all called a tax hike. #tcot
@brithume Extending current rates does not=tax cut.  Not extending current rates=tax increase.
@Steve___J And what do you think the "current tax rates" are? ICYMI, as of midnight they are the Clinton rates on all.  Bush rates expired.
@brithume Thanks, I see your  point. IMO, by not doing their job in a timely manner they let rates rise & that=tax increase.
@brithume How is maintaining the same tax rates a cut?
@LegioXIIIGemini As of this morning -- as of this moment -- those "same tax rates" have expired and higher rates are in effect.
@brithume It still not a cut,. Quit parroting Obama.
@brithume that must mean 2011 deal raised taxes then; no getting around it Brit
@Austin1622 The expiration of the Bush tax rates was set in law long before 2011. Happened when they were passed in '01 & '03.
@brithume Simple question.  If it is really tax cuts and a win for repubs, why is Obama crowing?
@brithume Are you kidding? If it becomes law, taxes are higher today than yesterday. Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining. #tcot
@brithume Many on the right do get this, but they are concerned that their constituents wll perceive it as a tax increase with help from MSM
@brithume duh.
@brithume So, how do tax rates being higher this year than last constitute anything but an increase?  Inaction is still raising taxes
@brithume What we need are MASSIVE SPENDING CUTS. $41 in new taxes to $1 in spending cuts won't fix anything. (2/2)
@brithume you must explain this in more detail ! All we have heard is rates go up for all ?
@brithume Who hacked your account??? My take home pay goes down-don't care how you frame it- that's a tax hike!
@brithume rates will be higher in 2013 than in 2012.  That's an increase
@brithume Aaaand your Washington submersion is complete. You're calling a $600 tax hike a tax cut. Love you but ... sheesh. #tcot
@brithume my husband was one those who didnt get it. I used your tweets to convince him. Thank you. :-)
@brithume The bill doesn't actually cut taxes, it leaves them the same as they've been for 12 years. Many pundits don't get this.
Hey @brithume, by chance did @TheJuanWilliams hack your Twitter account today? Your silly up = down tweet sounds just like him. #tcot
@brithume Talk about semantics... So Republicans pushed over the cliff so they could have appearance of voting a cut?
@brithume I get it. Just that it is a big joke. Joke is on future generations burried in bedt.
@brithume Let's not forget the Payroll taxes going up 2% across the board, or the new Obamacare Taxes and Regulations.
@brithume It only cuts taxes in relation to what they where after the US went over the Fiscal Cliff.  Compared to Dec 31, it is a Tax Hike.
@brithume You couldn't have said something this stupid just a few hours ago. Not that you wouldn't have given it the ol' college try.
@brithume NEW IDEA: 10% per year "wealth tax" on top 50 wealthiest Americans for 5yrs.  The news can write 50 stories to show the impact.
@brithume better watch it, you could get thrown out of the #GOP for telling the truth.
@brithume if tax collection is higher at the end of the day Brit, it's a tax INCREASE. Stop the spin.
@brithume Can u post a link to this info? BH: The deal actually does not raise taxes. Higher rates for those $400K & up are already law. T..
@brithume That is a technicality based on the few hours the higher rates were in place & IF the house passes. (1/2)
@brithume am I paying more in taxes than 2012? if yes, it raised taxes.  Only in DC is that called a "cut".
@brithume @DavidLimbaugh When does @rushlimbaugh come back??? We need our leader now more than ever.  Boehner is a tree, he bends to much.
@brithume I get it. Distinction w/o a difference. Rates expired 4 everyone. Leave them.  Got 2 start paying 4 spending sometime. Choices.
@brithume Social Security tax goes back up by 2% and Roth IRA's get hit with more taxes, meaning middle class gets hit mainly.
@brithume You were up way too late. Get some rest and read what you said and then tweet the truth.
@brithume $1 in spending cuts verus $41 in tax increases does not balance out to me. This dose not take in account the new Obama Care taxes.
@brithume $620bil in tax hikes are from the tooth fairy? Where r real spending cuts?
@brithume $16 trillion in debt & rising, 21 new Obamacare taxes start this month. We Conservatives DO get it.
@brithume I guess we need some clarity. Looking fwd to hearing from @RepPaulRyan & @marcorubio
@brithume But it also gets rid of many deductions .  That affects ALL.  THAT is an increase.
@brithume Insurance now wants full price for meds, cost went up 27% for less coverage, prop. taxes up,cap gains up. What am I not getting?
@brithume IT'S THE SPENDING!! IT'S THE SPENDING!! IT'S THE SPENDING!! How many times do we have to say this?!?
.@brithume the tax issue is a ruse to keep focus off spending problem, until we get REAL spending cuts there should be no deal
@brithume I get it Brit. Go give Obama a big KISS for me!
@brithume Where's the spending cuts Brit? $41 to $1 is not getting it done. Done with the GOP. They just lost conservative America.
@brithume expiration of payroll tax will reduce takehome pay over 2012, even if its not called a tax increase
@brithume by that that train of thought the spending cuts are already law so any spending cuts in the new deal would be a spending increase
@brithume Based on this deal Romney would have been a lame duck from dollar one.
@brithume Obamacare. Have you forgotten?
@brithume What about FICA? Staying at the 2% reduction or going back to prior level?
@brithume How can you say that taxes are not rising on those over 400Kas a result of the Fiscal Cliff Bill?
@brithume So Britt, how does this bill fix the fiscal problems of our country? Where is spending addressed?
@brithume Wheres the cuts?Oh Dems dont budget but just spend taxpayers money.Many on the left dont get it.
@brithume So should we be beholden to prosports and tinseltown figures for bailing our collective @$$es out of this financial muck and mire?
@brithume Thank you from some levity. Obama is playing the right like a fiddle and people are buying into it.repubs need to unite, not panic
@clantro I wish republicans would unite but we disagree too much to do anything as a whole...there really is no whole anymore IMHO
@ownbydp Exactly. Obama planted the seeds of civil war in the party with his goal of taking the house in 14. Time is running out
@clantro Republicans and libertarians are basically united on economic issues but we are being driven apart on social issues
@ownbydp true statement
@brithume : agree; but Affordable Care Act raises taxes for all
@brithume Except the federal spending hasn't been cut nearly enough.
@brithume You are wrong. Payroll tax increases on all. You are a fool if you don't see this.
@brithume however u phase it, the ppl who r in the best position  2invest in new ventures w/pay more taxes to a corrupt gov that squanders $
@brithume Although temporary, Bush tax rates were around for too long to be credibly cast as a tax cut now with the average American.
@brithume Amazing. In order to ever win, Republicans need to be willing to lose something.  This is not that.
@brithume Same drivel the senateusing to try and look good. Taxes DID go up from what they were yesterday! Quit drinking the kool aid, Brit!
@brithume No matter how the deck is stacked, small businesses are going to give Obama more money versus reinvesting in their business.
@brithume If only they could understand that.
@brithume Right on! This is a tax cut.The AMT and lower div/cap gain rates are very good.Some dont get 2012 rates but all below status quo.
@brithume Hey Mr. Establishment - even a nobody in TN knows its about the spending stupid!
@brithume Technically true, but they go up from last year, and THAT is what people care about.
@brithume..I like u but quit blaming the right...DC just as easily sequestered taxes down yr ago to 15 percent to make the left react...????
@brithume What I get is this is "technically" lowering taxes, but effect is higher taxes in '13 than '12. Failed chance 2 lower taxes paid!
@brithume Can we assume by this that you are under the 400k line? First they came for the rich, then they came for ......
@brithume Thanks Brit for a sober and reliable assessment. You are always "bang on the money"! Hope you and your family have a great 2013!
@brithume I don't think that's the real issue here. The deal does nothing to curb out of control spending. That's the real issue.
@brithume It's just $600 Billion in new spending, Oh thats makes me feel so much better, The car is just hanging over the edge of the cliff
@brithume and how does this solve our spending and national debt issue?
@brithume allowing the Bush tax rate relief to expire IS a tax increase whether it was voted on this AM or not.
@brithume bottom line is people will keep less moving forward with so much govt growth and poor financial management . R.I.P USA
@brithume Seriously?
@brithume. Simple semantics seem to make things better. Silly Billies. Congress shld have to pass ECO 101 before being sworn in.
@brithume thank you for your knowledge & ability to communicate please do not ever retire
@brithume nice way to spin it Brit.I think you have been in DC to long.
@brithume A tax cut that expires is one that automatically increases taxes.
@brithume -perfect for prez to be able say cut taxes today - what about debt and downing all taxes have now gone up w/expiring payroll tx
@brithume CUTS taxes, or maintains the rates we've had in place for a decade?  If the latter, then that's not a cut!
@brithume "The deal does not raise taxes.Many on right don't get this"- Exactly right.
@brithume I get it - supposed to be happy with semantics and gamesmanship - no taxes should have gone up for any reason - none
@brithume A bill that keeps tax rates where they've been for over a decade is not a tax cut.
@brithume.  They don't get lots of stuff.  Demand create jobs and not tax breaks. MC can't but rich suffers. GOP are OBTUSE & OBSOLETE.
@brithume Hey, whatever makes you feel better.
@brithume IF PPL send more money to Gov't,taxes went up.IF sending same $$-IT ISN'T A CUT(Tax Stay at best). Like Baseline Cuts, misleading.
@brithume Maybe in your wisdom you can point out all the spending cuts
@brithume Is that why waited until today to vote?  So R's still haven't "raised taxes"?
@brithume The main sticking point with most R's is the lack of spending cuts, not the rates back to what they were for those over $400,000
@brithume but it did via payroll tax cit not being extended. So low income earners hit hard as a result.
@brithume we (on the right) get it.  We also "get" that it does nothing to solve the problem and a great deal to exacerbate it.
@brithume Semantics!
@brithume but does the deal at all address the deficit or offer real spending cuts in any way? #fiscalcliff
@brithume Yes and when a dress is first stocked at "40% off" it's a "sale."
@brithume "Many on the right" don't get it because FOX News has spent all these years telling them to believe what you know is not true.
@brithume thinks that many on the right don't understand #FiscalCliff.  Uh huh. Did he mean to say left?
@brithume wow can you all spin ..alternative universe
@brithume what about payroll taxes?
@brithume I get that it will make the future tax increases next 2 impossible. That doesn't make it any better we still fail as a NATION!
@brithume I guess if it passed yesterday it would have raised taxes.
@brithume this was a bad deal.  It's the spending that's the problem. The only card GOP had was to force rates on all citizens to get cuts 
@brithume Taxes go up for those over $400K.No real cuts.Does not deal with the real issue of spending.That is the issue.Class warfare again
@brithume But I don't think it's realistic to think taxes could ever be raised enough to sustain current entitlements. Not even close.
@DavidLimbaugh @brithume We have 4 more years of Obama and probably 8 years of Hillary to go.They will find a way in 16 years.
@brithume Are you endorsing this surrender?
@brithume Huh? It does not cut taxes, those tax rates have already been law of the land for what 9? years? How is extending them a cut?
@brithume Actually with the payroll tax increase, everyone will see less money in their paycheck.
@brithume My point is Ross seems to think libs lost bc they've hurt their future ability to raise taxes sufficient to sustain entitlements
@DavidLimbaugh @brithume But taxing at 100% isn't enough to sustain entitlements.
@brithume maybe, but it will hurt the economy tax rates and tax revenues are in inverse proportion to each other
@brithume payroll???
@brithume dumbest thing you've ever said Brit.
@brithume doesn't it effectively raise taxes by taking away itemized deductions over $250K?
@brithume we need significant cuts.
@brithume talk to me about heath care "taxes" Brit!  and, all the indirect tax or expense costs passed on to all of us.
@brithume Explain... #fiscalcliff
@brithume Are you looking for a Cabinet position?
@brithume Payroll tax rate resumes at prior levels on all incomes - equates to a 2% increase on incomes to 110k
@brithume semantics. It does not extend Bush tax cuts for over 400k. So essentially a raise from last 10 yr rates. Further-payroll taxes too
