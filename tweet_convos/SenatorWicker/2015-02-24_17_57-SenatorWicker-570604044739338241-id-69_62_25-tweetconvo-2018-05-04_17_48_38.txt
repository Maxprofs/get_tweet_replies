@SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC the solution is Gov stay out Internet
@nomad33fw @SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC If the gvt doesn't step in and regulate then the corps will continue to exploit it for profit.
@grambo1980 @nomad33fw @SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC The govt is stepping in to regulate it FOR the corp monopolies #wakeup #nomoreregulation
@NanKolinski @nomad33fw @SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC do you even understand what the alternative was? #hashtagsaredumb
@grambo1980 @nomad33fw @SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC Do tell.
@NanKolinski @nomad33fw @SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC without NN Internet would become EXACTLY like your cable package.
@grambo1980 @NanKolinski @SenJohnThune @DagnyRed @FCC
@nomad33fw @NanKolinski how about when metro tried to charge cust xtra 2 access Netflix, Skype, "adv html" pages. That is not innovation.
@SenJohnThune @FCC There is no way any agency should have this power without legislation. Kill these regulations now!
@standfree4ever @SenJohnThune @FCC You are crazy, So you would rather have the special interest cronies in Washington make up the rules?
@grambo1980 @SenJohnThune @FCC Pro-Net Neutrality groups funded by George Soros do U really think no groups on the other side benefiting?
@standfree4ever @FCC I don't care who is funding it. Or what political side they are on. I care about the Internet and it staying as is.
@grambo1980 @FCC Then we are in total agreement watch what Mark Cuban says. Also, 332 pgs. of new regulations must change something right?
@standfree4ever I'll check out what Cuban has to say. Look wht google has 2 say. 332 pgs of real regulatory 2 telcom in line. unlike b4
@SenJohnThune @FCC Glad that this got voted in to protect the internet from your special interest corporate entities. Time to move on
@DagnyRed @SenJohnThune @Death4Jodi @FCC So you are for corporations exploiting your services for more profit?  Said no one ever
@SenJohnThune @BarneyFranken @FCC Repeat Can you say PANDERING?  Game over.
@SenJohnThune @OCAmericans @FCC  You guys had better because the people who voted you into power are awfully tired of backstabbing RINOs!
@SuperDriver318 <---Bravo! @SenJohnThune @OCAmericans @FCC
@SenJohnThune 4 million Americans argued that Title II was a good idea before Obama did. Pick something else to reflexively fight him on.
@SenJohnThune @BarneyFranken @FCC Great. So, repubs promise to fight back on 1 of the 3 things they caved on this week. Yippee.
@SenJohnThune @BarneyFranken @FCC  the king has spoken! All hail king Barack. All hail king Barack! Praise king Barack! Praise Barack!!!!!!!
@SenJohnThune @BarneyFranken @FCC time to defund that rogue organization. Now back to looking for my dialup modem and compuserve password
@SenJohnThune Then please make some noise. Because it's very disheartening. @FCC
Good. This is really important. @SenJohnThune @BarneyFranken @FCC
@SenJohnThune @FCC the solution is the resignation of you and your ilk, because you are the problem. Open internet is not.
@SenJohnThune @FCC I rather a"powergrab"from the FCC than the deathgrip cable companies like Comcast and verizon have on american broadband
@SenJohnThune @FCC Senator, THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT! Stop bending over for the telecom companies that send you checks. How corrupt r u?
@SenJohnThune #NetNeutrality is NOT an @FCC power grab. Stop needlessly politicizing something that benefits the free market!
Another way for the government to control us…we are not China!! Give us our freedom! One day the government will crumble.@SenJohnThune @FCC
@SenJohnThune @FCC Need to act to keep the internet free! #BlockNetNeutrality
@SenJohnThune @FCC The power grab is the one we are preventing by keeping a neutral internet. This is the will of the people.
@SenJohnThune @FCC Come on. Let us have our Internet. Put people before corporate profits.
@SenJohnThune @FCC @AllBobbyNoPin look at this lying dingus I can't
@AllBobbyNoPin *Ancient Aliens guy voice* REPUBLICANS
@SenJohnThune that's because you're a fucking moron, going against the wishes of those who elected your stupid ass.
@SenJohnThune @FCC  please stop obama's illegal power grab NOW !
@SenJohnThune @FCC If all you #Republicans aren't smart enough to count & understand what majority means then its time for you to resign RT
@SenJohnThune @FCC You are trying to mislead Senator. This isn't about politics. It's about freedom. #NetNeutrality
@SenJohnThune @FCC ...Wow Senator...you're a bit of a technologically illiterate shill, aren't you? #PleaseGoSuckMoreCorporateTeat
@SenJohnThune @FCC FUCK YOU Senator!  Fuck you AND your "job creators"!  Here's an idea...why not work FOR the American people for a change!
@SenJohnThune @FCC  "Power Grab" eh?  It's all overreach and power grabs...until you asshats are in power.
@SenJohnThune @OCAmericans @FCC The prima facia solution is to keep the FCC and the Federal government as far away from the net as possible.
@SenJohnThune @FCC @noprezzie2012 No choice. Just as @SpeakerBoehner  and @McConnellPress have no choice but to stop Obama’s power grab.
Actions please @SenJohnThune ! @fcc 
#StopNetNeutrality
@SenJohnThune @FCC Senator I believe ur committed but the rest of the party should run as democrats as there is NO difference-amnesty fold.
@SenJohnThune Most of you Republicans are collaborators and lapdogs of the Left, caving in to every tyrannical push that comes down.
@SenJohnThune @GACoastPatriot @FCC Rally the troops!  No credit for trying anymore. Sick of cowering RINOs & broken promises. #tcot
@SenJohnThune @physicsgeek @FCC And why isn't that already underway?
@SenJohnThune @StarCoreOne02 @FCC What does that mean? Please elaborate!
@SenJohnThune @StarCoreOne02 @FCC Neither party should try to make a power grab for the internet. It does not belong to Govt but the people
.@SenJohnThune, You could just #DefundFCC #DefundFEC for #NoNetNeutrality. Problem solved. @michelelfrost @FCC
.@SenJohnThune Prove it. #NoNetNeutrality #DefundFCC #DefundFEC @michelelfrost @FCC
@SenJohnThune @FCC @Tab1791 ......Republicans are a disgrace. ...you've caved or are about to on immigration. ....and net "neutrality"
@SenJohnThune @FCC #STOPNETNEUTRALITY ENOUGH of the DC POWER GRAB! #NoNetNeutrality #NOMoreRegulations #Freedom #Liberty #tcot #TPP
@SenJohnThune With all due respect, Senator, I believe the @FCC, in an effort to keep the #NetNeutrality we have, isn't making a power grab.
@SenJohnThune @FCC You damn wimps concede on everything you liar. Just wait until next election. Just wait. Hopeless helpless losers u all r
@SenJohnThune @FCC no your not you're caving just like the senate did on Illegals you need to be primaried
@SenJohnThune @FCC @tomwheeler should be charged with contempt for not going to congress when they asked him to testify.
@SenJohnThune @FCC We don't need any changes to the net.. Stay out of it. Leave it alone. You people let obama stir you up into a frenzy.
@SenJohnThune @FCC NO internet tax is great. Time to strip the #FCC of it's power over Congress. This is ridiculous. Soros activists won.
We control BOTH HOUSES @SenJohnThune how can @FCC grab anything if you do not pay them???
Do you mean "fight" like on Obamacare & amnesty, or do u mean ur really gonna fight 2 stop Obama bureaucratic thuggery!? @SenJohnThune @FCC
Then what the hell are you doing talking to a biased partisan rag like @nytimes about it then! @SenJohnThune @FCC
@WSCP1 Thank you for bringing that up! That @nytimes article made @SenJohnThune sound like "oh well we tried." I wanted to throw things lol!
@SenJohnThune @FCC Why not release the 332 page document so #WeThePeople can READ it and decide. YOU work for us!!
@SenJohnThune when are you clowns in DC going to get a set to stop regulatory agencies like @FCC from infringing on our rights?
@SenJohnThune @FCC What makes us think the GOP will not cave once again. Good job on allowing FCC to write law. What's the point of congress
@SenJohnThune @FCC Please stand strong for America! Thank you.
@SenJohnThune @FCC #NetNeutrality #TitleII
@SenJohnThune @FCC In all due respect, as a party, u aren't fighting hard enough for us
@SenJohnThune @FCC The FCC doesn't have the power to initiate "Net Neutrality" Nor does the President. Stand up for the people for once!
@SenJohnThune @FCC It's shocking how GOP and "conservative" media has lied about #NetNeutrality for benefit of donors. Disgusting. #tcot
I'll remind you of what I learned in DARE. Just say NO! 
@SenJohnThune @FCC
I seriously hope so or this country is going to come unglued. @SenJohnThune @FCC
