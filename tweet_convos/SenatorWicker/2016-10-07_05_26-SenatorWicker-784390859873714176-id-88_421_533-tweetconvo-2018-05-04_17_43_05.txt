@washingtonpost Will Aetna and UH take their losses against current and future tax liabilities? #justwonderin'sall
@washingtonpost Please remove legacy from @POTUS article. The only thing lasting about Obama's tenure are the lies.
@brucehallsports @krauthammer @washingtonpost http://youtu.be/4PeO0SfCw5s 
Obama's Presidency is more like a "runaway truck ramp", just like in mountains of Fancy Gap, Va.
Obama's whole time in office was a lie. We know that now.
Good one! Trump 2016!  Ryan 4 county dog catcher.  He might find that job within his abilities.
Obama admin is most corrupt from top to bottom and the two most corrupt DOJ's I have ever seen, and worst president
@sweetsabina @krauthammer @washingtonpost he hurt us all!!!!
@washingtonpost

But @krauthammer misses no opportunity to damage the only man who could put a stop to it. It continues w/Hillary.
@washingtonpost - How abt impeachment and/or jail for this treacherous POTUS?
@washingtonpost his a bigger crock than Hillary, he uses racism to remote racism
Right On! Obama legacy = Obamacare & Foreign Policy are in the crapper. Obama reaping what he has sown! So deserving......

Brit, finding it hard to watch your program because you're sounding more & more constipated.
@washingtonpost 
The legacy is the WORST Potus in American history! Period.
@washingtonpost THERE IS NO LEGACY FOR OBAMA!! But CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL!!  Neverhillary!!
@jjburdett @krauthammer @washingtonpost did I do that?
@washingtonpost Concerning way Trump talked abt women. Let the one that's never spoken like this cast the first stone
@jjburdett @krauthammer @washingtonpost that finger looks a little limp. What up
@washingtonpost Obama sucks
@washingtonpost 
What legacy does Obama have; Potus in U.S. History! Period!!!!!!!
The very worst!
@washingtonpost Wow. Powerful article.
Obama's Presidency more like a winding 9% downhill grade on highway with gravel shoulder, sort of speak.
@kevincorke @krauthammer @washingtonpost the Legacy he leaves is that of most corrupt president in history of the United States.
@washingtonpost I believe his legacy should be racism, corruption and impeachment
@NolteNC Great article by Krauthammer. Love that phrase "benign disengagement," meaning rotten foreign policy.
Just for the things Donald can say to derail the Hillary attack express, Mars is warming Hillary can you explain ths?
@washingtonpost  If only the world was a perfect place his Dream may have worked.
The ONLY thing "notable" about Obama's "legacy" - will be the number of FLUSHES it takes to DISPOSE of it.
Obama's failed ACA/foreign policies will provoke a reactionary barrage of lame duck actions from election to 1/20/17.
@washingtonpost It has been a complete utter failure!!! Obamacare, Russian Reset, Line in the sand, stimulus, etc etc
the best part of all this is Obama standing betwixt the pillars, blissfully unaware, as they fall . . .
Obama's historical legacy will be that Congress did not impeach him when they should have done so.
@washingtonpost Given 8 yrs of WP's Obama adulation, readers will be astounded by the heresy of Mr K's analysis
and yet Obama with approval ratings near Raegan and B Clinton.  If this is crumbling, where was Bush at in 2008?
So sad, for America and the world @FundamentallyChangeAmerica @LeadingFromBehind @UnvettedWeShouldHaveKnown
@washingtonpost I knew BHO would be a failure from day 1. Just like I know HRC will be a failure if she's elected.
@washingtonpost how much worst it will be after he's out of office, all types of things he hid from the U.S. Citizens
@washingtonpost brilliant and spot on.
@guypbenson @krauthammer @washingtonpost Obama doesn't care; Hillary doesn't care; Hillary only cares about Clinton foundation
Charles is a has been.  I won't listen to his garbate
built on quitsand,
@guypbenson @krauthammer @washingtonpost so you guys want us to vote for @HillaryClinton? All you do is bash Repubs, R u confused?
What is Aleppo? The burial ground of the Obama fantasy of benign disengagement. - Krauthammer
@washingtonpost given the reality Charles describes how can Ofailure be at 55% approval? Hi can Hill have such a lead
GET THE HELL OUT OF AMERICA
It is no surprise as we have watched the fall of the Roman Empire occur in our country. Nero's strings have broken.
@washingtonpost Thank God, he was the worst. I opposed every idea he had, how is that even possible? He is Elitist.
1st hard 2 believe this appeared NWAPO, 2nd the most flawed Presidency of a generation & the bar was low-Nixon/Carter
Wow great job Mr Hammer
@washingtonpost That would be Greek Columns, sir.
@washingtonpost He never did anything as a Senator ...no surprise here just the start of destroying the US!!
@washingtonpost @HillaryClinton Crime Cartel is leaving a stain on Obama legacy history will not be able to erase
The irony is the press is running stories how they miss him already...even though he hasn't left.
@washingtonpost #14painting He & Clintons shld b put n Gitmo w/wht terriost is lft They love'em sme terriost
Obama out? I don't think so..drop the mic krauthammer
@washingtonpost Obama will go down in history as the most arrogant ineffective divisive destructive president ever.
.@FBI & @DOJ keeping the regime's party in power through corruption.

Peaceful transfer of power is in jeopardy.

@brithume @krauthammer
@washingtonpost Obama biggest pillar is pulling the U.S. back from the brink. Noone appreciates what he inherited.
@washingtonpost When Mr Obama no longer has the power of office, he will hate America even more.
What a crock of shit and you know it! Check #approvalrating 2x higher than W #GOPdecline #DEMSwinagain
@washingtonpost
he's got a 55% approval rating & only gonna go higher as he's closer to leaving. I don't like him, but the ppl do.
@washingtonpost
@washingtonpost
@washingtonpost A republican get out and vote booth
@washingtonpost WOW... Republicans really are clueless.
@washingtonpost go campaign  hillary brit.  It's obvious she's your girl. FOX had moved to dark side
Charles having been wrong in his writing for almost 8 Obama years getting 1-2 more in before the end
lowest home ownership since the 60's, low gas prices- great! Healthcare costs staggering! $$ grwth
@washingtonpost Crumbling?! You're nuts!!! He's one of the best Presidents we've had!!
