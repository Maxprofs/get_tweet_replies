@SenatorWicker shame on you.
@CaniLupine I respect the constitution & the 2nd amendment. I also realize it's been 200 yrs since it's been written: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LORVfnFtcH0&feature=player_embedded …
@CaniLupine free speech doesn't kill people though
@CaniLupine @SenatorWicker for what endorsing murder. Guess you do too.
fuck you @SenatorWicker
you should read a history book if you think the second amendment has jackall to do with assault weapons for civilians @CaniLupine
@sharked_up i wonder if those are the same kind of people who believe the bible is word for word the literal truth
@Lekajaw usually
@sharked_up nah, plenty of “new atheists” are like this about the constitution
@birdnamed d'oh
@SenatorWicker @SenatorWicker I am glad I don't live in Tupelo any longer. Sad for everyone you still represent.
@SenatorWicker You are a disgrace.
@CaniLupine Studied it college, my papers on the topic have been used in speeches by top military figures. Have a nice day!
@TheJeanMartha go back and study some more...
@SenatorWicker yeah well just shut down major cities from fear of being killed instead
@SenatorWicker well now, that was silly wasn't it?
@SenatorWicker lmao youre a fucking idiot.
@SenatorWicker Congratulations! You're an idiot! #whywouldyoutweetthat
@SenatorWicker Do you know that this makes you a piece of human excrement? Do you know?
w/e. the bigger ? is since when did goblins get to run for senate RT@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.
@SenatorWicker Bad decision. Assault weapons were used to mow down innocent children.
@SenatorWicker You should be ashamed of yourself!
@SenatorWicker HOW MUCH DO YOU GET FROM THE NRA SIR?
YOU DON'T OWE THE CHILDREN OF THIS COUNTRY ANYTHING YOU COWARD? HOW DO U SLEEP AT NIGHT
@SenatorWicker @Travon I'll never vote for any senator who voted against the ban ever. Regardless of the office.
@SenatorWicker Shameful.
@SenatorWicker -- I expected nothing less from you. Yech
@SenatorWicker Welease Wodewicke. Cunt.
@SenatorWicker How will you spend your NRA blood money, Senator?
@SenatorWicker You are a useless hypocrite.
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” Yeah, that's not really something to be proud of fuckface.
@SenatorWicker fuck you, you piece of shit.
@SenatorWicker You should not  be proud. You had the chance to make us safer, you failed. And you ignored the electorate; you're a disgrace.
@SenatorWicker Shame on you for supporting NRA lobbyists rather than listening to and protecting your constituents.
@SenatorWicker Hope you lose a family member in a shooting. You probably wouldnt care anyway.
@SenatorWicker  Well, that's certainly what the American people wanted. More assault weapns out there.
@SenatorWicker boo - the gun lobby will reward you I am sure but you have many lives on your conscience
@SenatorWicker for the children, no weapons!
Is it not odd that @SenatorWicker approves of background for credit cards, but not high-powered weapons?
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” You stupid mother fucker piece of shit kill yourself
@SenatorWicker You're part of the problem, fuckface.
.@senatorwicker be proud of your decision? Next time, can you think for and not of yourself? NRA doesn't elect you into office, people do.
@GreyAtheist @senatorwicker 

You also see what state he represents? They are the farthest RWNJ in this country. Sad.
@broncosatheist Yes, I did. Still doesn't mean he can't think for humanity and not just as a narrow minded bigot.

@senatorwicker
@GreyAtheist Thats the big issue tho. He doesn't think for humanity as a whole. He might lose that padded pocket he gets. 

 @senatorwicker
@broncosatheist I know it's not my place, being that I'm alien n all, but seriously, how can he back NRA as proven liars?

@senatorwicker
@GreyAtheist I don't know my friend. I've never figured it out &I've lived here my entire life. Foreign or not you're right

@senatorwicker
@broncosatheist indeed, it's depressing the level of senselessness.

There's only thing left to do... eat!! ;0
@GreyAtheist that looks yummy. I'll be right over you can make me some too. :-)
@SenatorWicker go fuck yourself
@SenatorWicker
@SenatorWicker You, sir, are a moron
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” TBH it's a stupid bill...
@SenatorWicker you absolute FUCKWAD
@SenatorWicker Is this something you're proud of?  You shouldn't be.  The next blood might well be on your hands.  #dontbeproudofbeingstupid
@SenatorWicker that was very ignorant of you.
@SenatorWicker I hope u feel good when the next mentally ill person get their hands on one a kills innocent ppl. You moron. Shame on you.
@senatorwicker Tweets on Dec. 19 don't match current action. NRA cash at work! #sellout #TURD
@SenatorWicker Shame on you! Maybe you should re-read some of your tweets about your concern for the Newtown families!
@SenatorWicker @CommonCormorant good job. We're safer now. Now petition to enable US citizens to legally own tanks and ballistic missiles!
@sjparis aren't you French?
Aren't you in NZ?
@CommonCormorant yes on both counts, but the world is safer when American can legally blow themselves to bits.
@sjparis we just fkn kill children.
@CommonCormorant i know. It's absolutely disgusting :(
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” @YaBoiCDaY I guess the ricin worked, huh?
@yaboicday And please don't reply I'm a fashion that questions my morals.  I could see how you could take that comment as such. #satire
@coseph you're a weird little shit, Joe.
@YaBoiCDaY oh, but this guy that sent the ricin is "mentally unstable". Now I don't condone it, but taking things in your own hands is...
.@SenatorWicker @Ddraiggoch1969 Because you are a heartless sell out to the NRA.
@SenatorWicker Why?
@SenatorWicker i guess now they should pray so idiots like you are dont decide their fate going forward #hypocrite
Brilliant move baby killer-enabler. @SenatorWicker
@SenatorWicker fucking war mongering  Christian, people hater. Shame. See how you'd feel if one of your spawn was shot. Idiot
@SenatorWicker You are an embarrassment. I hope the Money the NRA have you was worth another child dying.
@SenatorWicker you are a disgrace to your constituents and to the rest of the citizens of this great country
@SenatorWicker Why Would You Admit That?!?! 
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” Good, let's institute background checks before we jump to banning.
@SenatorWicker congratulations on showing the world proof you're an idiot and a stain on society.
@SenatorWicker resign immediately
@SenatorWicker fuck u then
@SenatorWicker You're a disgrace. How much money did the NRA pay you for that decision?
@SenatorWicker GOOD! Don't let them ban our right to bear arms!
@SenatorWicker You have no soul. And a freakishly tiny, amusingly misshapen penis.
This is something you are proud of?! Pls explain why you voted no. “@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.”
@SenatorWicker are you fucking serious? You can keep your thoughts and prayers for the victims and families of mass shootings asshole
@SenatorWicker Shame on you. Do you write letters to your mom with that pen?
fortunately for @SenatorWicker it is not very easy to coat a tweet in ricin
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” well aren't you a fuckin dumbass
@SenatorWicker and why the FUCK would you do that?? You're a disgrace to your country, you say it so proudly, like it's a good thing. Cunt.
@SenatorWicker Good for you!
@SenatorWicker You don't even understand what you're voting for.
@SenatorWicker I just saw a senator shoot himself in the foot.
@SenatorWicker and that's why you're a despicable piece of shit. shame on you.
@SenatorWicker So basically you said 'fuck you, I care only about myself' to the families of the victims.
So uh, are you just completely un-self-aware or what https://twitter.com/SenatorWicker/status/279643916540710912 … @SenatorWicker
As news continues to unfold about the horrific shooting at a school in Connecticut, my prayers are with the families & first responders.
@SenatorWicker moron
@SenatorWicker you're a skunk
@SenatorWicker If only the right believed in stimulus we could fund the free distribution of assault weapons. Get excons back on their feet!
@SenatorWicker I just voted not to kill myself. Reconsidering...how hard is it to get a handgun in this country? I am also a felon. Problem?
@SenatorWicker Well, ever day is a dark day isn't it, there's no sense in analyzing the shades of darkness. It's all pitch black.
@SenatorWicker Shame on you.
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” Thanks for nothing
@SenatorWicker  coward
@SenatorWicker ignore the haters. ad hominem is their go to.
@SenatorWicker the majority of americans thank you!
@SenatorWicker thank you :D
@SenatorWicker Sleep well. We won't.
.@SenatorWicker "I just voted against the ban on assault weapons." Why? What's your better idea for protecting innocents from gun violence?
@SenatorWicker HERE'S HOPING IT COMES BACK TO YOU IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY
@SenatorWicker You should be ashamed of your votes in the Senate yesterday. More people will die from gun violence because of you.
@SenatorWicker And you obvious feel good about that.  Why?  Do you need one for any particular reason.
@SenatorWicker Assault weapons have no place in the hands of ordinary citizens. Your no vote is a disgrace.
@SenatorWicker fortunately you don't need intelligence to be a senator, and I'm not talking about the hockey team
@SenatorWicker That is so very wrong! I am extremely disappointed with you & your like minded colleagues.
@SenatorWicker what an asshole
@SenatorWicker you know, because Americans NEED assault rifles for freedom - ASSHOLE!!!!! YOU DISGRACE OUR COUNTRY & IT'S PEOPLE!!!
@SenatorWicker something to be proud of?  No wonder people send you gifts in the mail. Your reward is waiting in hell...

@SenatorWicker GOOD JOB SENATOR!!! Don't listen to govt sellouts trashing you!
@SenatorWicker. Great choice. You must really love children. You're a true american!!!
@SenatorWicker Shame on you.  Explain yourself, this is senseless.
@SenatorWicker I will work my hardest to have you defeated next election to protect my children
@SenatorWicker this is just like that time you tried to fuck that sheep and I told you not to.  You never listen to me.
@SenatorWicker I'll just vote against you in the next election.
What a creepy old asshole you are. Rt “@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.”
@SenatorWicker   ....thank you for making Canada look oh-sooo good. 'We' hope someday 'You All' understand your own consequences.
@SenatorWicker you will not be re elected.
@SenatorWicker Thank you! Please keep up the good work!
@SenatorWicker  I hope one day you truly feel the pain caused to people as a result of guns and can then speak intelligently on this issue.
@SenatorWicker hey mate, I'm from Australia, I have 3 kids who go to school and I thank God everyday that  clowns like u run another country

“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” Dickhead!

@SenatorWicker Your hypocrisy and disdain for Americans are heartbreaking. https://twitter.com/heySMM/status/324781203519578112/photo/1pic.twitter.com/og3fGVofaU 
@SenatorWicker sorry to read that.
@SenatorWicker hypocritical old man. Keep whitening those chompers and using the solarium and you'll be a o fucking k champ.
@SenatorWicker When my daughter asks why mass shootings happen, I will stumble over my words and remember you. #heartless #LackOfImagination
@SenatorWicker @CatherineDeveny US gun decision tends to make me sad and depressed . . . then I remember its mainly Americans that get shot!
@SenatorWicker the whole world is laughing at you mate. Harden up.
So tell me, @SenatorWicker, what does Wayne LaPierre's cock taste like?
@SpikeEcks @senatorwicker is it a prerequisite that American senators be devoid of any moral responsibilities whatsoever, I wonder?
@MikeHod Morals don't fill campaign coffers. Unless you're using 'family values' to discriminate against gay ppl, I guess. @SenatorWicker
@SenatorWicker WHY?
@SenatorWicker Thank You for making Mississippians feel safer against the gangs and crime that other states pretend not to know about in MS
@SenatorWicker I enjoy reading all the comments.
@SenatorWicker #ShameOnYou Wipe that smirk off your face you enabler of criminals.
@SenatorWicker So you joined the ranks of fuckhead senators that would rather push their own agenda than represent their constituency. Prick
@SenatorWicker Let me guess, Senator: guns don't kill people. Actually, thanks to the support of people like you, THEY DO.
@SenatorWicker shame on you
“@SenatorWicker: I just voted against the ban on assault weapons.” Then future shootings like Connecticut are on your hands. Disgraceful.
@SenatorWicker I hope those who voted you into office vote you out very soon. It seems morally indefensible to resist #guncontrol
@SenatorWicker I just voted you an idiot. #wanker
@SenatorWicker Coz have to put a thousand rounds in a deer to bring those things down, right? Oh & kids can get pumped full of lead? #derp
@SenatorWicker So back to Attacking video games then? don't ban the guns ban the games! great logic!...................... NOT!
@SenatorWicker About 1.4 million have died by gun in US since 1968, more than in all wars (Rev-Afghan) combined. 3500 since Newton. > WTC.
@SenatorWicker Maybe after the next massacre, you'll vote FOR the ban.
@SenatorWicker I got a hot shit in the chamber, and I wouldn't mind unloading into your slack-jawed drooling gob. You useless prick.
@SenatorWicker you should be so proud...
@SenatorWicker You're a dead-set scumbag!
@SenatorWicker what a douche
@SenatorWicker you're an idiot and are sacrificing your constituents
@senatorwicker I hope you enjoy your NRA blood money.
@SenatorWicker @nathangielis My prayers are with the first responders.May they attend more shooting massacres that I could have helped stop.
@agnuspagnus @SenatorWicker yep great find by @phreak09, these weak pricks just don’t get it
@nathangielis @senatorwicker @phreak09 It's pretty unbelievable. Not sure what it will take.
@SenatorWicker stop play politics and look at the lives your actions will cost. How the hell can you sleep at night?
@SenatorWicker you're a pathetic, gun loving nutcase. No wonder American's can't get the gun measures they need with idiots like you around
@SenatorWicker Twat.
@SenatorWicker you are a disgrace.
@SenatorWicker what's the definition of arms n the right to bear them? Doubt when 2nd amendment written they could foresee assault weapons..
