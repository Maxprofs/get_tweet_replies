@theonlyadult @SenatorWicker @BenjySarlin - I have brown people in my family that didn't do a Cedar Point like line jump to stay here.
@theonlyadult @Netmilsmom You want to award illegal behavior? That's your solution?
@theonlyadult @Netmilsmom B/c it might be hard to enforce u give up? No more DWI arrests etc b/c u won't get em all?
@SenatorWicker @pgstroud no doubt on that !
@SenatorWicker @caitlinstreit1 Translation: "We have enough cheap labor workers right now, let's see how the economy goes..."
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Now talk to the ones in NJ.  Sadly my state will vote for it.
@SenatorWicker @KLSouth Not a good move. Proves you haven't really read or are in on the fix
.@TresaHuffman Very good move…. Kill the bill @SenatorWicker
@SenatorWicker Outstanding!  Don't buckle...  And see if you can talk some sense into your idiot, pandering, cowardly colleagues.
@SurlyNYCon @MilamBill @SenatorWicker This bill should never, ever be supported.
@SenatorWicker @NumbersUSA Thank you for thinking of America's unemployed first and foremost!  NO Amnesty!
@SenatorWicker praise The Lord. Thank you!!!
@SenatorWicker Thank you
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter thank you Senator Wicker clearly you know who pays your wage
@SenatorWicker @Palinspired Better to be the few and right, than be wrong with the many. GOD BLESS
@SenatorWicker @Hardline_Stance Thank you, sir
@SenatorWicker @Hardline_Stance Thank you, Sir. I wish @SenBobCorker realized his serious mistake
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter  Then vote no. Ate you saying a flawed law is better than no law?  That's what's wring with congress.
@SenatorWicker YOU BETTER! #NOAMNESTY #STOPAMNESTY!! #FAIRIMMIGRATION!!
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter follow @liblogic for the BEST conservative images/news.
@SenatorWicker @Fore_Warned Didn't you vote for Cloture, Sen Wicker? Do you think we're so stupid we don't your cloture vote enabled this?

@SenatorWicker THANK YOU 4voting #NoAmnesty; realizing flawed #immigration bill will Not work. O does Not enforce current Law, won't this 1
@SenatorWicker @Kerryepp We will Actively work to replace all who vote for NOT IN SHADOWS #illegalIntruders.they've put Americans in shadows
@SenatorWicker good!
@SenatorWicker @middlemom "improved enforcement"? That's not what I read. You're bought and paid for too. #immigration
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Thank you for voting against this bill as written. More border enforcement first.
@SenatorWicker @Palinspired One flaw that I see is that the boarder being sealed should be the trigger for all the rest. 1st things 1s
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Thank you Senator for standing up for America & Americans!  God Bless
@SenatorWicker Thank you.
@SenatorWicker I certainly hope so!  Desoto Co in the tip of the sip is watching  your vote
@SenatorWicker thank you
@SenatorWicker Please don't think we R so stupid that borders can't be closed first as Ryan just told Sean. Do not insult R intelligence.
@SenatorWicker glad U R standing up for American not illegals. Close borders & build fence. Then prove border is closed then we will talk.
@SenatorWicker it is extremely flawed
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter #immigration Good. Secure our borders first!
@SenatorWicker this bill is a step in the right direction. Sorry to hear this. #DreamAct
@SenatorWicker you're evil and duplicitous. You played your role fool. We ain't buyin'. Get a job liar.
@SenatorWicker I wish my Senators - Flake & McCain - were as smart as you.
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Good tell Heller, et al!
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter thank you!
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter @theonlyadult typ libtard racism. If you can't prove a point call names point and scream RASIST! We aren't scared
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter I believe that hundreds of phone calls from concerned & angry voters today had something to do with this. lol
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter thank you #noamnesty
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter BLESS YOU!!!!!
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter - Thank you!
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Thanks, Senator Wicker, for opposing the very porkish, very supine fake immigration bill.
@SenatorWicker 
Steps to #immigartion:
1. Secure Border
2. Ensure Border is Secure
3. Maintain Secure Border
4. Deal with illegals left here
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter how many Senators r with you. Bill destroys middle class, cause of unemployment, loss of respect 4 law
@SenatorWicker Thank you.
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Enforce the laws we already have .
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter #immigration When you consider how Mississippi rates on wage scale, I'm sure it wasn't caused by "illegal aliens"
@SenatorWicker If gov't wanted to halt illegal immigration, it would stop subsidizing it w/ citizen minimum wages & US tax code @tedcruz
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter need to let ALL (R)s know that we are watching carefully, how many times do we need to say it? SECURE BORDER NOW.
“@SenatorWicker: I will vote against passage of the #immigration bill. Corker-Hoeven amdt has improved enforcement provisions.Good.
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Thank you.
@SenatorWicker well by all means,just sit idly by and be a proud member of the party of no
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter thanks, i will put you in the "has a pair" column
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter TY!!
@SenatorWicker @AnnCoulter Do we even know what the bill will cost now? #tcot
@SenatorWicker Good call on this one. If our current laws are not enforced, then what will make this one any different. Please help Rand
@SenatorWicker @MilamBill thank u...
@SenatorWicker You should have voted against it earlier this week. I don't understand you. I know your constituents disagreed with your vote
@SenatorWicker @NumbersUSA Where it's flawed is, there is no entitlement/welfare/anchor baby reform/elimination. It's not about bldg. a wall
@SenatorWicker thank you!
@SenatorWicker You're not fooling anyone, Senator. (Well, not many) @kausmickey
@SenatorWicker #NoAmnesty Build the damn fence now! Not tomorrow! Now!
@SenatorWicker #NoAmnesty Every Senator that is a true American weather Dem or Rep should vote no. Illegal is illegal!!
@SenatorWicker @judyme3 Thanks,Roger.I was shocked u were going along w them at all.I know you fear God,but they slap Him requiring justice
@SenatorWicker vote for cloture and against the bill..covering all your bases. Way to take a stand.
@SenatorWicker @dontspeakforme well that's 1 down
@SenatorWicker Thank you for standing tough!
To: .@SenatorWicker #ImmigrationBillIsBeingUsed2DisenfranchiseAmericanCitizens #TheUSBelongs2WeThePeopleObamaAndCongressNoRight2SellUSOut
@SenatorWicker @kevintobey ask the others to join you! Be loud!
@SenatorWicker what are you talking about?  You voted for it?  Not even a good liar are you?
@SenatorWicker @MarkSKrikorian You voted aye on the crucial vote but think your voters are too dumb to understand, you weaselly POS.
@SenatorWicker lies
@SenatorWicker whether you crossed the Atlantic or Rio Grande, we all want the same thing #opportunity
I can imagine @SenatorWicker I also hate how all those white people immigrated from Europe to the Americas.. #fuckyou
@SenatorWicker your vote the other day for cloture renders your future vote on immigration pointless. Stand up from the beginning.
@SenatorWicker @Csinaco Ever wonder why a nation would give up it's citizens without a comment? Makes one go hmm in the night.
@SenatorWicker   Good.
@SenatorWicker @GCGATOR24 Should it Pass Defund the Republican Party!!!
@SenatorWicker thank you for voting NO on Amnesty
Thank you @SenatorWicker for your vote against the #immigration bill. #tcot

@SenatorWicker @KamaainaInOC #NoAmnesty #SecureTheBorder Illegal immigrants are criminals.
@SenatorWicker thank you sir
@SenatorWicker   Thank you!!  The borders must be secured FIRST! #NoAmensty!
Good MT“@SenatorWicker: I will vote against passage of the #immigration bill.
@SenatorWicker @PATR2014 Looks like one senator took heed from his constituents. Keep calling, folks!
@SenatorWicker Those in waiting for sovereign approval to join our country and take part in our nation of laws, tip their hat to you sir.
@SenatorWicker will you vote to correct Section 4 of Voting Rights Act? Do this right away.
@SenatorWicker The worst thing for border security is to vote down the immigration bill.  It allows potential terrorists to hide in shadows
@SenatorWicker The best way to fight terrorism is to pass bills like this where people who come in can be tracked through documentation.
RT @SenatorWicker: I'll vote against the #immigration bill. Corker-Hoeven amdt has improved enforcement provisions, but still deeply flawed.
RT @SenatorWicker: I'll vote against the #immigration bill. Corker-Hoeven amdt has improved enforcement provisions, but still deeply flawed.
@SenatorWicker What flaws do you see?  Is it that it provides FAIR JUSTICE FOR MILIONS HERE?
@SenatorWicker Then I will campaign to have you recalled.
