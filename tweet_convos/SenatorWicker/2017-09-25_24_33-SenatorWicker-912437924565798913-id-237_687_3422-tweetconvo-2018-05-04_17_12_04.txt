Yeah! Thanks @BarackObama for starting the STEM program and urging hour of code every year! @BarackObama gets credit for this!
Exactly! Trump supporters think that stem projects are something new! Lmfaoooo
Bc all they watch is #FakeFauxNews and god forbid they ever told a positive story about @BarackObama SMH
The news media is to blame! They never the good that he has done! Smh! Stem projects were introduced during his administration! Smh

Behind the time, Rs act like STEM is new. Has need funding for years. Trump's 200mil is only 4$/student. That's going to help A LOT not.
Please do a Google search for Obama, stem and  education and you will see lots of results. Most education funding got blocked by Rep house.
only thin ive ever heard from him that i agree with
Even though @realDonaldTrump has never, ever, ever, ever used a computer in his life.
@BarackObama started this program! We have to give credit where credit is due! Thanks @BarackObama
God Bless thank you for backing America !
Thank @BarackObama bc he’s the one who has pushed for this year after year while Rs blocked funding! It’s already in place!
what we need is discipline in the classroom!  Teachers know what to teach.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS But DADDY doesn't believe in science or facts.
No clue
Where is it going to come from? Certainly not you!!!
Yes
Thought you didn't believe in science!!!

So true dear President Trump
@BarackObama Thank you for the STEM program that you consistently put in place!
Not reported by MSM
Bc it’s already in place by @BarackObama
But what about social skills? Sounds great on paper but without positive social interactions this is a joke!
Does this idiot even know what the STEM program is, I doubt it.
Trying to push Obama policies as your own I see. Do you only steal others ideas or are you truly incapable of an original thought?
He doesn't even email #notmypresident
Stop the VISA programs they use to replace our students/children, keep them out #BoycottNFL @realDonaldTrump @potus #MAGA #MASA #DTS
Umm $200M<$3.1B or don't your math skills count that far? @POTUS doesn't give 1SHIT about STEM.
I so agree with our President !

Schools need shop & automotive classes brought back as well as recess for the younger students! Federal Gov. needs to get out of the schools

You call that leading by example
So what are you saying for the whole world teaching kids

Leadership is the most important issue for the US !! Then I think the US people should find a leader and not a

Hey #FoxNews Can you pls help @lpackard who is stage 4 #cancer sufferer who #Trump BLOCKED?
President Trump blocked a woman with stage 4 cancer on Twitter. 

Here’s her response: 
Really
Like he gives a shit. He's taking away BIRTH CONTROL, MAMMOGRAMS, CANCER SCREENINGS. He ridiculed the gold star family!  MONSTER!
He is so bad at reading. But so good at draft dodging! Small victories I guess.
It's time to lock this monster and his family up!
So want to put money into education.....

@IvankaTrump @POTUS omg while they slash funding for public schools, Pell grants, work study?? Hypocrites!! Dangerous!
Why won't he tweet about that?
Is this what a Sr WH Advisor does? Stage phony PR photo ops to make a #WhiteSupremacist appeaser/sympathizer look less like a race baiter?

Has the MSM picked up this story????
Where is Charles Krauthamer?
No I work at a uni, STEM is a safe space no diversion of opinions. I'm surprised in our bio dept hasn't changed XY to be gender neutral
@IvankaTrump @POTUS Says the most ignorant president in history after firing all of the scientists and denying climate change.
You should all be LOCKED UP!
You know climate change is part of science, right?

@realDonaldTrump definitely does not know what STEM stands for off of the top of his head
“Save Ferris”
Ivanka, Speaking of access to computers, hit me up on Gmail and we can discuss those private WH visits we talked about. #WayOverHerHead
PLEASE ASK DADDY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL AND HELP PUERTO RICO
Hmmm, since when does Trump support science? Lies, lies, lies.
Let's be honest here, 99% of stem people do not support trump, foxnews, so by all means promote it.
Computer Programming: Modern day ditch digging for the masses.
Why is Ivanka even there? She has never done an hour's real work in her entire life. She is absolutely of no consequence .
Thanks for continuing the Obama ideas in the @WhiteHouse!
Although stem is important, so is trade. Those need to be put back into schools. Learn a trade, build a town.
Jared kushner-lock him up. Lock him up. Lock him up. Hey this is fun.
#DotardDonnie
You suck Ivanka. Get out of our White House. Go to jail
 Email me when you get there.
I like stems.  I can tie a knot in a cherry stem in mouth! #MAGA!
Says the man who thinks he can just talk to someone and have the internet "turned off." @realDonaldTrump You know NOTHING about #STEM.

So your dad uses twitter to lie, bully, call names & spread propaganda. U use it to TRY & make that fascist bigot seem human. Not working.

The key is having quality instructors who should be adequately compensated.  Just throwing money won't be enough.
Don't forget anti women, anti nonwhite, I bet he hates dogs too! Kid and no dog?
How about comprehensive healthcare for everyone, regardless of ability to pay an arm and a leg?




Is Tillerson going to open an investigation about you and Jareds e-mails? LOCK THEM UP.....LOCK THEM UP. You are an Embarrassment!!!!!
And maybe find ways to mitigate climate change?

If Leadership is the most important issue in America, you better step down (show an example), as your a failure.
And hopefully less data breaches like Equifax. Right mr president.
That can only be if Microsoft products are not used.
Careful with The Dotard!
Says a science denying grifter? The irony is deep with this one.
Is that what your piece of paper w/ the 9 bullet points tells you devils advocate?
This man belongs no where near science.
The  4 brain had privileged access to that and much more. No evidence he learned anything. Grabbing pus-y? Oh yes, unbeatable.
Sure, let's develop skills, and outsource jobs to China...  what are these kids going to do with their knowledge, please, enlighten me?
Outstanding, & thanks for all your doing for the children & the rest of us, God bless all. 
But her emails!
*If they are lucky enough to avoid any major medical problem
People who have no educational experience doesn't comprehend math and science aren't the only factors to endure our children's development
Huh?
Thank you Mr. President Trump you love America and all the children. God is smiling for children are the best gift. Wow Excellent job.

The private schools?
Will you support tuition reimbursement for women engineers in public service? Put $ where your mouth is!
PSLF is a real thing.  check it out. It's not based on sex either. It's for everyone in public service. Equality 
As side from the technical skills, people will learn critical thinking and analytical skills that is so vital for success.
Skills my father never bought for me and I never bought for mine!
The worst So Called President Ever#!
