How about letting ENDA come to a vote, you gutless disgrace? Is that vomit on your shoes? // RT @SpeakerBoehner Re: #ObamaCare #smallbiz ...
@jefftiedrich @SpeakerBoehner Is this what constitutes intellectual debate for the left and LGBT community?
What, it's my fault that the gin-soaked @SpeakerBoehner vomits on his shoes and then passes out drunk on his office floor? @isaiahsvision
@jefftiedrich @SpeakerBoehner What proof do you have of this and what does it have to do with the topic?
There was a report on Fox News about it. // RT @isaiahsvision @SpeakerBoehner What proof do you have of this and what does it have to do ...
@jefftiedrich @SpeakerBoehner I thought you liberals hated FoxNews and said all they tell are lies, now you are referencing them? Source?
It was discussed on Hannity last week. // RT @isaiahsvision @SpeakerBoehner I thought you liberals hated FoxNews and said all they tell ...
@jefftiedrich @SpeakerBoehner I can find no reference to it.  Provide proof.
.@SpeakerBoehner you asked for a delay-now you're complaining about the delay. #BoehnerIsRidiculous
@Honey17011  bet you were one of dolts screaming arsonists, jihadists, terrorists when GOP asked for reason, now clap for the Liar in Chief
.@JackieJackielg when did the GOP ask for reason? GOP demanded ransom. GOP was less critical when Med Part D rollout had trouble. Wonder why
@Honey17011 Medicare part D was voluntary and did have some minor problems (what normal people call 'glitches') Ocare is a disaster.
.@JackieJackielg if you think Boehner gives a fig about your health care or anyone else's, you're nuts. He cares about the Koch's. $$$
@Honey17011 @JackieJackielg Where is your PROOF Boehner cares about Koch $$$?  #FullRepeal
@1OKCupcake @Honey17011 No point is discussion, these are kids who have zero information.  Waste of time
.@SpeakerBoehner don't you ever get tired of spouting crap, Speaker? #ACA is here to stay. You're gonna love it. Wait until Hillary is POTUS
.@PeterMAbraham oh the outrage of the selective amnesiacs. How many lost under Bush? And 9/11 on our OWN soil. Idiot. @SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner 
Thank goodness the collection of Obamacare taxes hasn't been delayed!
@SpeakerBoehner We are asking the same question as you flip flop on immigration/amnesty.  Get some convictions and stick to them.
.@SpeakerBoehner asks @BarackObama "what's next" & says "delay the entire law" before more havoc. http://m.speaker.gov/press-release/small-business-latest-bear-burden-obamacare-failures … #teaparty #tcot
@jennybethm @SpeakerBoehner Jenny you hit the Nail on the head. Boehner Asks O what his Plans are. Never able to use Strategy to Oppose O.
.@SpeakerBoehner you'd rather we didn't have ins at all. Or a 40-hour work week, OSHA protections, food safety regs, or the right to vote!
“@SpeakerBoehner Re: #ObamaCare #smallbiz delay: another #BrokenPromise that leaves Americans asking ‘what’s next?' http://1.usa.gov/1ifWoFF ”
@DavidMeeks @SpeakerBoehner 8 mil ppl have gotten refunds from ins. companies. Thousands have healthcare for the 1st time. You are wrong
@SpeakerBoehner What about all those #jobs you republicans were going to create after the 2010 election  #NoJobsBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner We in the trenches knew nothing was broken. All Americans were getting adequate healthCARE.U should of asked us peons.RPh'68
@SpeakerBoehner  F Off & D Bi**h     BONEr
@SpeakerBoehner Better check your facts.Obamacare is on the move. You cant stop it but you could help. Oh, I forgot you don't help.
@SpeakerBoehner please concider impeachment..aca is a corrupt diabolical fraud..its common knowledge ......do it.!!! Save america now.!!
@SpeakerBoehner what resolutions to this chaos do you envision realistically transpiring?
.@SpeakerBoehner #WhatsNext Is your #SorryAss Stop all this BullShit - You Need to Pray 2 day that Your #HigherPower forgives you! #Shame
@SpeakerBoehner still waiting to hear your idea to fix it or replace it, so STFU
@SpeakerBoehner you are the 3 more powerful man in America, work with the president, make our country prosper!
@SpeakerBoehner I won't cry for you when @NancyPelosi  is the speaker
@SpeakerBoehner Obama has created jobs. If you got out of the way and passed his jobs act more would hapen
@SpeakerBoehner raise minimum wage for all Americans and cut your pay. You should be fired for lack of work. You are a failire
@SpeakerBoehner you and your sheep need to work some more to get a pay check. 150k a year and little accomplished or work is a handout
@SpeakerBoehner can you just shut up John and do your job bill is good. The law of the land. Heritage came up with it
@SpeakerBoehner Gosh, I know U just want to save the ACA but big things sometimes take time to do. Keep fighting for the ACA Mr. Speaker.
@SpeakerBoehner Enough.  When one becomes like a broken record he is tuned out.  We get that you & your GOP buddies hate helping folks.
@SpeakerBoehner Stop TALKING, DO something.  Legislation preventing any further modifications to law w/o congressional approval, maybe?
@SpeakerBoehner Oh Shit!! Thought we were going to be UN-herrasted today, but here he pops up with more lies!!!
@SpeakerBoehner mr speaker it's YOUR duty to challenge the unconstitutional seizure of LAW MAKING that EXECUTIVE branch is practicing.
@SpeakerBoehner On the off chance we take Senate in 2014, why not #HRes36 & have an indictment ready. Why ru helping BO destroy America?
@SpeakerBoehner - What's with #HRes36?
@SpeakerBoehner if you want the delay it makes it look like u want it in the long run. Say you only want to repeal the mandates.
@SpeakerBoehner @SenatorWicker So when is the individual mandate delay coming? The Day before Christmas?
@SpeakerBoehner The Pope openly questioned your #BrokenPromise concerning the poor. Why would you seek to remove healthcare coverage?
@SpeakerBoehner why more republican obstruction. What else? No no and hell no. That was and is the line.
@SpeakerBoehner You're sounding a lot like a broken record blah blah blah wah wah wah! The little crying baby who doesn't know what to do!
@SpeakerBoehner I am grateful to @BarackObama for fighting for Affordable Health care for all Americans @pfeiffer44
@SpeakerBoehner  Cry me a river. Such a hypocrite.
@SpeakerBoehner
@SpeakerBoehner have a happy Thanksgiving, if that's possible for you. I'm so glad that Obama has pardoned you.
@SpeakerBoehner But you voted for cloture. .. welcome to your world
@SpeakerBoehner obamacare obamacare obamacare mr. speaker hows that jobs bill coming along!
.@SpeakerBoehner "What's next?" This is the part where Obama leads us into a war based on a lie.... OH WAIT.
@SpeakerBoehner Is it LEGAL? Does #obama have the authority? If not, WHAT ARE YOU going to do about it? Courts? Talking will not solve it.
@SpeakerBoehner yeah, at least b4 when ppl were denied for pre-existing conditions that was the final answer.
@SpeakerBoehner . Somehow Obama will find a way to blame the Republicans and maybe even blame George Bush...
@SpeakerBoehner Let's discuss your 2010 promise: "We're going to have a relentless focus on creating jobs."  It has been anything but that.
@speakerboehner get to work you drunk Oompa Loompa.
@SpeakerBoehner You can buy an election but you can't buy backbone.
@SpeakerBoehner Sir, would you mind stepping up and actually fighting the good fight We the People hired you to fight?
@SpeakerBoehner I am not a partisan, but the GOP needs a vision to work towards, to inspire, not just to be oppositional.  #suchadrag
@SpeakerBoehner and did I mention...... You look so damn ridiculous when you tweet stuff like this.
@SpeakerBoehner 2 Things - 1. Term Limits 2. Do your job
@SpeakerBoehner 

Then there are the Democrats that can't learn to duck no mater how many times their supposed friends hit them in the face.
@SpeakerBoehner step down Boehner, and make way for Pelosi... At least she knows how to control her caucus, and get things done.
@SpeakerBoehner REPEAL is the answer not fix. Need new plan. Don't screw this opportunity up.
@SpeakerBoehner what is your solution? At least the President is trying. You even admit to not trying!
@SpeakerBoehner do you hate Democrats more than you love your people?
@SpeakerBoehner YOU SIGNED UP FOR OBAMACARE - 9% APPROVAL RATING BOEHNER - GET TO WORK!!!! REPUBS USELESS- WE WILL SAVE LIVES VIA OBAMACARE
@speakerboehner Hopefly an individ mandt delay being as "big business" delay looks lk he cares more abt "big business" thn The People!
@SpeakerBoehner and you let it Happen. Hope you are looking for a new Job wait Obama has not created any and you let it Happen
@SpeakerBoehner Well Me boy what promises have you made let alone broke.
@SpeakerBoehner is this even constitutional???You know, that document that the president ignores and congress doesn't look at anymore?
@SpeakerBoehner Then why pray tell did you sign up? surely you have enough money for healthcare on your own. O yeah, my tax $$$'s
@SpeakerBoehner how is it the left are masters at using and abusing the courts but you guys can't seem to find your own rear ends?
@SpeakerBoehner but that only works if you file the damn lawsuit.
@SpeakerBoehner point to the section of the law where unions and congress get a special subsidy. Was it amended? Slam dunk 4 SCOTUS.
@SpeakerBoehner Why r we paying members of Congress if Pres gets to write and execute the laws?
@SpeakerBoehner U guys are lawyers. Has a case been filled dealing w/the illegal union carve out? Union members should know its short lived
Drinking gin straight from the bottle again, chucklehead? / RT @SpeakerBoehner Re #ObamaCare #smallbiz delay: another #BrokenPromise that...
@jefftiedrich @SpeakerBoehner Obama lied & now everyone knows it. No wonder the left's in such wild/uncontrolled panic. Happy Thanksgiving!
@SpeakerBoehner The citizens need equal treatment under this and all laws! He cannot keep changing the law without Congress.
@SpeakerBoehner Speaker Boehner, Select Committee now please #Benghazi Is someone holding something on you?
@SpeakerBoehner looks like Cruz an Lee were right again.
@SpeakerBoehner @JohnFrankPa YES JOHN BEOHNER. What is next? Another negative presser?
@SpeakerBoehner its more than that, it's yet another bypass of the authority of congress to make law.Your only action will be a tweet. Swell
@SpeakerBoehner Eveerything is delayed except for  the aveerage American and his family, that doesn't look like a good plan to me!
@SpeakerBoehner 

A tragic mess..

So many lies..

So many liars...

It is however nice to see that some Democrats are starting to catch on.
@SpeakerBoehner I'm an American that wants to know what your plan is Mr. Speaker (for now anyway)
@SpeakerBoehner seriously take some pride your the speaker but you all you do on twitter is heckle the ACA and Obama. Talk about your wins
@SpeakerBoehner   It is just to delay the horror of more millions kicked to the curb
@SpeakerBoehner Dam This Shit- Facebook. Bitchez, yeah -Find out why i said that.
