Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!
@Lori_Ella @realDonaldTrump I'm shocked Trump is breaking all promises. Just shocked.
what promises is DT breaking? The man isn't even in office.
I can't take questions like that seriously.  @jodywallace @PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump
give DT a chance. Has he done anything wrong yet. Stock market up, jobs saved. What?
still can't take that seriously. surely you're joking @jodywallace @PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump
LOL, Ella, u must be one of those narcissistic snowflakes that protest not knowing why
you go hide back under your rock while I go adult. shoo.
u proved my point, lol
Patty, Unions have caused more loss of jobs than corrupt idiots hacks  like you! You're a curse to the beautiful state of WA!
so making up a statement like this and acting as if it's fact makes you feel good.
I lived in WA,  Boeing moved their jobs & HQ out. Not a damn thing "made up" hacks, unions & idiots caused job loss!
that is not what happened.
I lived in WA, that is what happened! Constant union strikes & sky high taxes as poor Patty begged them to stay.
You are wrong.
@anon6116 @realDonaldTrump  Are people understanding now they were conned?
@Bikingcatlady @realDonaldTrump -Trump has sold out the working and middle classes 'bigly'.
@girlsreallyrule
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump DT is right. Union's demands from companies are not fair to workers, as well as, high cost of dues
Stand back and Trump go. He can produce jobs.
The Republicans were successful just saying no to everything Obama wanted, so now the Dem's should do the same to Trump
To Donnie,  I guess when you are born rich, live rich and don't care about people you there is only one person you admire.
@DeepEndGear @deeI would have never voted for you had I know you were so hateful towards the other elected officials, ie TRUMP
@girlsreallyrule @realDonaldTrump Trump conned the voters. He's cares only for their votes, he got it he no longer needs them.
I'd guess you would be the one to know how a steel worker feels about his union leader in PITTSBURGH! Way to spread hate.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump anti-union does not mean anti-worker
Who believed him?  Fools.
More LIBERAL Bullshit!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump BS! Unions pushed workers to accept NAFTA. Think of the cheap prices, they said. I remember !
What planet were you on then?

I WAS the Union 20 years ago but  you believe MSM & the politicians. SMH
@realDonaldTrump Senator you and all Dems have your work cut out for you: there can be no cooperation with this corruption
Get him Patty!
Block him Patty.
Senator, it is a shame some people actually believed him.  I never did and voted for HRC.
@girlsreallyrule @realDonaldTrump More than half of what he has said and promised are lies.
@dzsteph @realDonaldTrump Exactly what we expected!  Drumpf is such a sad piece of flesh.  So sad, folks. It's going 2 b so bad
Democrats don't want workers to have good paying jobs, they want them on government assistance so that they are more reliable party voters
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump ...Very unpresidential of you (Donald Trump).  Americans keep being suckered to lies after lies..
@LSangston he ran on pro business unfortunately people think that means workers
Senator Murray, please stand up against these nominations. We need Dems to fight.
Duh.
Do your part yo stand up to @realDonaldTrump . WA State is counting on you.
the truly wonderful thing about @realDonaldTrump is that unlike the Bush neocons, he does not give a rip about your babble.
yep he's attacking local leaders who made jobs go overseas and is bitching about Trump bringing them back #cucksville
please support an investigation into Russian interference in the u.s. Election before 12/19!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump you all just don't get it do you. Same old same old. How up politicians.
the voters were fooled - well some of them were
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump idiot, the union is not a labor leader...
@realDonaldTrump  President-Elect is DOING a terrible job representing America's. Perhaps he should FLEE the country. #carrier
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Yeah and I bet he voted for T***p too!   HAHAHAHAHA
@JeffreyGuterman Anyone surprised?
to suggest a billionaire in a gold-plated tower
w/ early Alzheimer's surprises you?
Really?
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump MORE FAKE NEWS, from the Party of Actors, Comedians, Hate and Violence.  Don't hate...HELP
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump his supporters had to learn sooner or later what a liar they voted for.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Just one more indication that he says one thing and does another. He lies.
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump :Trump's true colors, a lier who cares not about people but only his headlining ego, lie, lose
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Union Czars do not look out for workers. They steal dues and live off the fat of Washington
#ImWithChuck
@SenateDems zebras ran on the idea they will change their stripes guess what happened
@realDonaldTrump How many union members are there these days? Most workers agree - unions are ruining this country.
Thank you!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump WE are fighting. We expect you to do the same. Wrong is wrong is wrong.
No, he is nominating an anti-corrupt-union-leader cabinet. @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
what did he do that's corrupt?  Don't ruin our image of Canadians being decent people
Trump voters were so duped
@SenateDems Union wkrs have dropped from 27% to 13% of work force,wages too Are union leaders doing a good job? Liberal math?
@SenateGOP @ElectoralCollge That's because he's mentally unstable. But the GOP seems to think that's OK.
It's like he's giving voters every reason NOT to vote for members of his own party in the 2018 midterms.
They know that %30 of the country will vote Republican no matter what they do.
#Vote4SatanIfRbyName
Yeah, but it's that other 60%-70% that could just as easily sweep them out of power.
Not while Republicans are in charge of the voting process in so many states.
#EndsAlwaysJustifyMeans
So then you're essentially saying it's a one-party state for the rest of eternity?
you do realize Trump was responding to attacks from the labor Leader who wanted an all or nothing deal.
@SenateDems Union workers pay taxes. #TaxDodgerInChief doesn't. His voters already know they've been conned.
Stop the hate and divisionary tactics. you lost, give it up and stop lying about people for political gain
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump 
He used the working class to get their loyalty, their votes! He didn't mind taking their money!
@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump  Keep up the good work Senator Murray.
@realDonaldTrump that is why the GOP constantly uses race bait to trick the WWC. They are fools.
wrong again Patty! You didn't live in a job rich area you would appreciate a jobs cabinet.DEM's have lost their way
@realDonaldTrump lied to the American people?  Shocker.
I hope that at least some of his supporters are starting to see the Con and will help us get rid of this Red Horror
Are we really surprised about this? #ImWithChuck
@SenateDems yep! This is exactly what Trump is all about. He can't make it work, so he attacks. The blame game.
Yeah, he was lying...
@SenateDems companies flee country? It's not outsourcing cause prod costs and labor are cheaper abroad?
they leave to make more money(GREED). carrier 7.6 mill not http://enough.ceo 's took bonuses n complained bout labor costs
thanks for standing up for workers!
