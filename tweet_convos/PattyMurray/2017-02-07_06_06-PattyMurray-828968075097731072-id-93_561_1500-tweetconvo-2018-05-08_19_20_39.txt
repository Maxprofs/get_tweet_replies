Remember: Betsy DeVos has called public education “a dead end.” #NoOnDeVos
@JuddApatow guess what ....she is right
WRONG. At odds with the teachers unions desire to raise children of the state and not the family.
she has no vision. She has no clue.
Senator Murray, thank you for your beautiful speech on Monday.  Washington is lucky to have you as their Senator.
I'm an American family and I fully support charter schools. Parents should have rights in education Patty
@SenateDems How So? Doesn't she want choice. Democrats constantly want to decide what's best but exclude themselves.
No, it's deeply at odds with your control over it, and the incessant spending on it, and the money the DNC gets from the unions
Soo, you don't care about the future of America?
Also, there is NO Constitutional purview for the federal government to be involved in this in any way.
There should be a "moral" purview. Educated or uneducated will be our leaders of tomorrow.
It is already failing, $70B/yr spent while we rank 25th in the world.
I agree, but we will rank even lower STARTING NOW!
I doubt it, but we'll see. Don't get continuing status quo out of fear.
@SenateDems Not this one. Children deserve better than underperforming teachers. You are the problem. Choosing $$ not kids.Sad.
A good attempt to block. you need a few republicans who will stand up to dumb party decisions. Keep working that, trade votes?
Thank you!  Proud WA teacher/mom. My 9 yr old daughter & I watched today. You were good role model in male dominated Senate.
how much money have teachers unions contributed to your political campaigns?
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Murray. Thank you for trying.
well you couldn't rally one more GOP member. The only thing that makes the Rs strong is that the weakness of the Dems
@MrsAdrienneBosh: Public education sucks b/c of people like you Patty Murray!
Thank you for listening to your constituents and for saying #NoOnDeVos!
WE are #34 in education and proud! Let's not change anything! More of the same please
: I prefer her vision than having my grandchildren brainwashed by liberal loons in the public school system.
liar
NOT according to most Trump voters.Shes DT eye candy w/a Valley Girl style of Air-brain knowledge & responses no Co. would hire
how does department of education help my local school district?
I am watching you speak right now during my planning time!  Thank you!
how are the schools in WA State doing? They are a mess. Don't talk about something you know nothing about
Thank you for your eloquence and passion about IDEA. Watching CSpan 2 now.
nope. Choice is better than dictate. Get over it
Thank you for stating the facts and putting pressure on R senators to vote #NoonDeVos
Washington state pays $12,000/student/year...how are they ranked?  Why not $50k/student?  LIB policy failure.  #NoOnDeVos
thank you
Thank you Sen Murray from this Ohio #PAEMST teacher for fighting for a qualified candidate! Your support means so much!
"Not true!"Parents want to have a choice for educating their children. That's why we #supportdevos #SchoolChoice
@RepAdams Simply not true!
Wrong. Again. #Resign
And at odds with actual teachers who know what they're doing.
@SenateDems why does the DOE exist? It is terrible and has ruined education. Also, no provision for it in the Constitution.
@SenateDems squeaky wheel is your tactic
Call the Senators NOT on this list, your best bet for some support.
@SenateDems No! The problem is an education system beholden to unions & lobbyists! Time for a change to improve thru CHOICE!
DO THE RIGHT THING @SenToomey #DumpDevos
thank, you I called my senator, #hopeingforthebest #NoOnDeVos
@SenateDems  you are out of touch with parents and families
@SenateDems yes!!! @marcorubio @RoyBlunt
@SenateDems I think it is right in line with parents - it goes against your NEA buddies - they have more money - shameful
@SenateDems thank you!
@SenateDems Thank you Sen Murray. The Nation stands with you
Quit playing politics confirm ALL of POTUS cabinet, We The People are sick of this partisan BS
no we aren't.  Bring back the days when not paying taxes on your house keeper meant you got sacked.
I believe she will be fresh eyes! She will be able to see what is lacking in the public schools in comparison to charter school
@SenateDems " ...with SOME parents....." I think she will b great. Ur defending a failed system that puts US behind most n weld
@SenateDems That's a LIE!! & When U Lie Ur a Liar!! You Represent Teacher's Union's  Not We the People..
@SenateDems Yet R's turn a deaf ear, riding on Trumps coat tail.
Right into Political oblivion
Thank you for fighting this!!!!
Do you know that @PattyMurray is full of lib shit?  She needs to see a doctor (preemptive strike: not me). Thank you.
@SenateDems Are you getting $ from the teachers union?  If so, put the kids first not your pocket.
Common core is deeply at odds with the parents too, when did you start caring about that?
@SenateDems what time is the vote today?
@SenateDems you deserve a big glass of wine and a long nap after all this. Well done! #DumpDevos #holdthefloor
Do you know that @PattyMurray is full of lib shit?  She needs to see a doctor (preemptive strike: not me). Thanks.
@SenateGOP Too many reasons this woman should be no where near a Public School.
@SenateDems her vision includes $$ signs
time to follow the money, #DeVos payoff to the #gop thats votes yes.
@SenateDems I appreciated your words last night senator Murray. #resist #holdthefloor thanks for speaking for us.
Thank you for speaking!
Thank you for standing up for ALL American Children! #NoOnDeVos
Thank you Senator Murray! <3
Do you know that @PattyMurray is full of lib shit?  She needs to see a doctor (preemptive strike: not me). Thank you.
@RepAdams Which republican senators should we call??
Yours
Says who? You - a career politician and liar. Wake up clown. School choice helps inner city schools and you had 8 years?
Whoa! Unfollowing.
It's all about your support of the Unions! Shameful
Source? Or is money talking?
