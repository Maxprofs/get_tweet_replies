I'm very fortunate to have you & @SenatorCantwell as my senators!
So does this mean you and Sen. Alexander can try this again?
Go over with less hate in you heart tell them the democrats made a mistake and you are ready to help fix it. You will be surprise at what will happen
What do you think of the @JohnKasich and other Governor's plan? Bipartisan fix? Are you considering this?
Bless you
And please remember that YOU work for US. So, only pass a bill if it's what THE MAJORITY of your constituents want. #SaveACA #FixACA
We want #MedicareForAll PERIOD!!!
Please ensure fix to ACA drops federal exchange income limitation for individuals in states that didn't expand Medicaid!!
Medicare for all.
My senator.  Working quietly but steadfastly for WA & America for nearly 25 years.
Term Limts......
medicare for all works for all,
I am so proud to have you as my Senator!
Patty aren't you one of the 60 non par votes with the current mess. Now u want a bipar switch the newly crowned Idiot McCain MEMBER THE WALL
Hahahaha!

She said "bipartisan"!

Hahahaha!

Like she knows what that is!

Hahahaha!
Medicaid for All will bankrupt this country & destroy quality of care. Dems hv no good solutions. All u want is govt control.
Thank you. Do not let GOP pass this horrible bill.
#ACA is a harmful partisan health care bill. #RepealAndReplace
Bring it! This is the way legislation is supposed to work. A bipartisan approach will represent more views, serving more of the Citizenry.
Thank you for calling out Trumpcare as harmful. Please consider Medicare for all.
And Obamacare is awful..  What now  and please don’t bring up Psycho Sanders.
Medicare for all works!
Thank you for your hard work. First, make sure Graham/Cassidy is really dead. Don't trust Republicans to pull something at the last minute.
Really so many could not afford Obama Care and were fined - how can you say that is good with a straight face.
How about we start with tort reform to drop malpractice insurance. Can you imagine how this will positively impact health care.
Be bold.
Just can barryscare.  It should never have been put in place.  You're a typical political hack.  Do some work for once.
Oh, you're ready now but 8 years ago,  where was your bipartisanship yah hypocrite.
Thank you Senator Murray!
You've already worked on a bipar agreement, ACA.  That's not good enough for GOP.  Push for what's best for the people u represent #M4A
You're boss on the hill and proud to have you showing up for WA! PT - Edmonds
Thank you, Senator, for doing what you can to reach across the aisle to work on improving the ACA for the betterment of all Americans. 
Have you submitted a bill for all of Congress to look at???
Why is Congress not acting on helping Puerto Rico now? What do we Americans in mainland have to do to get Congress to help our citizens?
Write if you can a health bill that meets all the requiememts of medical and budget demands and stop saying what you will do!
Thank you, Senator Murray, for never giving up even tho the GOP just want to take away HC from 32 million ppl & won’t ever compromise.
#MedicareForAll please
Thank you and so v proud you are my senator!!!
Cuomo is another nut job. Says he is an immigrant. Guess so if born in NY.
A bigger issue right now might be removing trump before he gets us all killed attacking N.K. time is running out fast.
Thank you
I'd have to say Don't do it, Senator. The GOP has proven it can't be trusted. They can wait until the 2019 version of bipartisanship.
I do not believe you. Bipartisanship is slang for ignoring taxpayers and kicking the healthcare fiasco down the road. You'll never fix it.
GOP's objective is to fund tax cuts for the rich by killing Ocare. What sort of bipartisan agreement do you expect? What will u compromise?
I'm a native Tennessean and I've been begging @SenAlexander to re-join you. I wish you both luck.
Call @SenMikeLee > https://goo.gl/Xemxot 
Urge him to OPPOSE the Graham-Cassidy bill too.

Then maybe both sides can work together.
GOP is afraid to work with Dems at all. Further it is focused on whether it can stem the tide of its $$ laundering, conspiring & TREASON.
You're awesome, Patty! 
B U T  Patty, do not sacrifice our principles in serving the American public!!!
Sentaor you must be so Embarrassed by Trump and Your Party's Behavior and Blatant Disrespect for America = Puerto Rico & Virgin Islands !
You Dems need to get #Medicare4All bill ready for when we take back the Senate in 2018
Thank you for taking leadership on a bipartisan bill. Save us from this torture!
get past the Trump crap. get a bill together that's good for the USA
Thank you for being the voice of reason.
I have loved Patty she nice the first day she put on those running shoes and headed for the hill
Thank you!
Keep kicking healthcare reform down the road until Obamacare totally collapses than no one will have healthcare.. brilliant strategy senator
Thank you Patty!!
Pls tweet w/#cnn #HealthCareDebate @amyklobuchar
Paging @SenAlexander Plz pick up a spine and report to @PattyMurray office for tea and bipartisanship. #HealthcareForAll
WHY is it partisan. Help us voters understand? All i know is it cuts planned parenthood. Otherwise, it just puts more control in local hands
Get this trending: #IsTrumpIgnoring3MillionPuertoRicanAmericanHurricanVictimsForCasinoFailureRevengeOrRacismOrBoth He's committing genocide!
Tell Lamar to grow a pair and vote no!
Thank you Senator. Alexander said previous talks fell apart. Seems like they walked away. Can you confirm?
Thank you
Please keep working to preserve the best of the ACA and finding some sort of bipartisan compromise that allows this fight to end.
The ACA is what should've been  dropped. It's caused more problems then it ever solved and no one can afford it. The ACA was built on a lie.
I'm so proud to have you represent my home state. Washington has an honorable public servant, which is unfortunately rare in today's America
Thank you.
Your fired
Thank you Senator!
Just how many more bites at this apple is this recalcitrant GOP Congress going to get? Doing the same thing & hoping for a different result?
Thank you @PattyMurray for your work to make healthcare reform #bipartisan! #StopGrahamCassidy #ProtectOurCare
I hope you're willing to work with Bernie Sanders on Medicare for all.
Thank you, Senator.  I am grateful for your steadfast pragmatism.  Truly.
Thank you Senator Murray
I thought Lindsay Graham had something to do with it......Not Trump Care.
Thank you, @PattyMurray! I appreciate all you do and am proud to be represented by you!
You'll have to pull the silver spoons out of their mouths first.
When will you co-sponsor Bernie's Single Payer Bill??
Thank U Senator. Please dont give up
We support a bipartisan solution. Hopefully the bill doesn't come to the floor. An atrocity
Where was that "bipar" when you rammed Obamacare down our throats?
I'll be 100
Try to get your partner Alexander to vote NO so the two of you can proceed. Paul will vote yes we need one more R.
Thank you Senator, I appreciate your leadership.
Thank you @PattyMurray !
You rock!
The only Bill we want you to back is #MedicareForAll #PeopleNotProfits #SinglePayer #WholeWashington
What the hell is it going to take for them to quit proposing such unpopular legislation?
Please rethink your position on importing affordable prescription drugs from Canada. Stop taking money from health insurance industry Thanks
Thank you Senator Murray. I am proud of the leadership you & my @SenAlexander demonstrate on healthcare. I support this  completely.
Thank you Senator! Americans need bipartisan efforts to fix ACA.
So you will explicitly, publically oppose #GrahamCassidyDeathBill?
Patty: The Whitehouse is Blondy People...Get leave out Los Africanos.Reagan:JFK.Lady Oscar.Scott
Pot meet kettle,  remember obamacare???  #MAGA
As long as you and all your pals are exempt from it right
Will you demand @SenSanders drop single payer? *waiting*
Actually your a #Communist simpathizer sitting at a table hoping to sign #SinglePayor in order to #BankruptUSA and bring in your #Agenda
Dont be childish
Thank you for all that you and your staff do to #ProtectOurCare! #GrahamCassidyNO #Trumpcare #stopGrahamCassidy #ADAPTandRESIST #Indivisible
NO
We are not in the bipar mood until this effort to repeal the ACA is completely killed. No Repeal and no bipar.
We need to kill this effort to repeal the ACA. It's a bit too soon for you to be sitting at the "BIPAR TABLE" Senator Murray.
How can anyone claim they are pro-life and be against health care for all?
I will believe Congress is looking out for us when they have to have the same healthcare as us. Not until then will I trust
Thank you!  You are the voice of reason in the din of chaos, and are much appreciated 
Please help the people being arrested and dragged out of the public hearing!!!
Issues faced by Americans r nonpartisan. #WeThePeople deserve competent loyal potus & functioning USG. .@GOP, stop politicking & #DoYourJob
Thank you
.@SenateMajLdr shut @PattyMurray @SenAlexander #FixACA work down to push #CassidyGraham #TaxCuts4Rich #DeathBill for @GOP Dark Money Donors.
Thank you for your leadership!
You’re doing nothing...but sitting there.

Thank you Patty!  #YouRock!
I bet !!! Just begging anybody to come help you ensure corporate health care continues. You should fight this hard for people not corps
Thank you Senator Murray.
As a disabled person I vouch 4 the dignity Medicaid affords me. N that is minimal, trust me.Lost my first home 2 this disease.Not another!
Um, where were you during Jan - Aug?!?!?

Wasting our tax payer $$'s on #Resistance ...NOW, you want to fix YOUR mistake ...aka #Obamacare
You are a hero, Senator.
Wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your party's evil Obamacare!!
That's my Senator. She represents like a boss.
Stay strong and persist, Senator!
While I don’t understand many of your actions, I am so thankful for your dedication to women & the oppressed.  How May I Help?
What are the concessions Dems have made to improve this bill?? My guess is ZERO! That is not bipartisanship! Obamacare is the WORST! Fix it!
You probably have time for a snack, or a sabbatical.
Yap,yap yap.
they not gonna...
Thank you.
Here's your bipartisan solution:
Thank you, thank you! Keep your head up.
Bullshit, you only support one path because the bernie supporters would have your head for anything less than universal healthcare.
They are the only thing keeping democrats alive right now so lets stop pretending you have any bipartisan bill ready. Hack.
Corporate healthcare should never be an option.  The health and well-being of our people should never be dependent on profitability.
It also should not tax the commonwealth into oblivion either.
I call BS on that one. Cassidy Graham bill is such a weak repeal and you make it sound like body's will be burning in the streets.
We are with you Sen. Murray. 
It's sad when something as centrist as socialized healthcare is off the table and we have to negotiate with right wing extremists for ACA.
You'll see one of these days when obamacare totally collapses and than no one will have healthcare..
Thank you Senator.
Should have been there 8 years ago
i thought you said, "bi-polar agreement" for just a second
#Medicare4All
Get rid of Speaker Ryan and replace with Rand Paul.  #backstabberRyan
Don't just wait go and work with the other side nothing wrong with that. Be creative help fixing mess you and Obama created.
When did improving ACA go from consumer benefits to ensuring profit goals of private market through public subsidies?
Both parties are just itching to "stabilize" already extremely profitable private markets with public funds...
Why are @lisamurkowski & @SenatorCollins balking? You & Senator Alexander are doing the right thing for Americans, Patty! #Trumpcare a con!
Thank you Senator Murray for working to IMPROVE Americans' lives!
#ThankYouPatty
Did you mean Bipolar? The Dem. Leaders have not helped once only critisized NOT HELPFUL! Meanful bipartsian leadership. Not seen today
Senator Murray, Thank you for your willingness to work on bipartisan agreement. Patience is a virtue.
You might be waiting a long time.  I don't think Reps for the most part care anything about working with Dem now that they have control.
Every call I make to a GOP Senator = “vote no on this bill. It’s unamerican. Instead, please work with WA Sen. Murray on bipartisan fixes.”
At what cost?
Greg what are you asking?
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you!! We are hoping G/C TrumpNoCare goes down in flames!
Thank you!
Update On False Eviction Homeless, Seattle Mayor Resigns b/c of Child Sex Scandal! BRING MY SON RIVER HOME NOW!!
Keep it up! Represent us - we've got your back! #ZIP98105
Stabilize with #CSR commitment.  @SenAlexander @marcorubio
#Policy is what is most important to almost all Americans! Not B.S. platitudes & bipartisanship!
 #FightForUs! Not ur donors!
Thank you for continuing to fight for us, Senator!
Left candidate! It's sad to see the once "party of the ppl", be so corrupted bythat #policy doesn't matter.
 #Policy is The MOST IMPORTANT
GC / Trumpcare is all about tax cuts
@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain This is the right way. Let us give this a chance and aim for a lasting fix instead of stop-gap
Dems& GOP both R stupid& foolish. Back 2009,Dems didn't outreach2 GOP& Pelosi said "Pass it &then Read it". We citizens Rpaying the price.
All you have to do is support Medicare For All!
Scott that's no solution, that's a give away of something I paid for. The best solution is to let people buy what they need, or don't need.
Typical statement coming from?
Thank you @PattyMurray proud you're from my home state!
Please help PR. They can’t wait 2 more weeks. People are dying. No power, no food or water, hospitals full!!
AHCA and Sanders med bills are welfare trash them all and go back to what we had and you law makers stop taking money from big pharma
Until the (D) start fighting for the populace left agenda, they will continue to lose! (D) wld rather lose to a (R) then win with a populace
Thank you Senator
Get off your arse & repeal & replace before your on Obama care& u r voted out of office.No harm intended.
You can't use the word "bipartisan" until you stop with divisive partisan labeling.
Why don't you go back to shitting your pants over black people kneeling Jim?
Which is where the majority of the base is and a majority of the country! So why not back the populace left? Oh right! #CorporateDonors
Why are democrats so God damn weak? The party is falling apart&the establishment dems will not get off their high  2 back the populace left
#NoToGrahamCassidy #NoTrumpcare
Need it. Hitler care sucks  (Obama care )lock it up with Hillary Clinton. And throw the keys away.
Sounds more like extortion Pat
Thank you, Senator Murray. Pls tell me your colleagues also have a plan to save CHIP plus expedited aid for Puerto Rico as well!
The Republicans should know that Demoncrats decide what we have for healthcare regardless of the voters.
Keep working on it-Both parties need to be more futuristic w/ their healthcare plans, our thinking is stale--I know you smart Senator Murray
Hope you stay there Senator. We haven't given up. Thank you for doing the same. 
I don't believe that.  You are #3 top obstructing and resisting democrat senator.
There's a better way...what you've been asking for @SenatorCollins @LisaMurkowski!

Don't accept a bandaid that'll only last til 2026...
Graham-Cassidy needs to be scrapped in favor of Medicaid for all and predictive medicine approach, saving us millions.  #BetterThanBernie
Mercy Jenna! Think about this.R u willing to be taxed to the max? Why work? Study what is hap to socialist countries- Venezuela.
My canadian health card...
typical socialist proposal. Find a real job and abbott this nonsense campaign.
Please keep fighting!!  Thank you Senator!!  Loved meeting with your staffer last week!!
Thank you Senator how can Americans come together when politicians won't this gives hope of democracy working
you will never get a bipartisan bill that covers enough people to be worth passing. Push for single-payer and don't compromise.
Thank you!
Support single payer, patty.
Thank you!!  Keep fighting. 
#GrahamCassidyNO
