DeVos was unwilling to make basic commitments to not privatizing or defunding public schools. #NoOnDeVos
@STFUParents what are you afraid of? Losing the ability to continue to brainwashing our kids into believing your nonsense
We are fighting for public education. Not "nonsense." What are you talking about?
common core. That nonsense. It has to go
It also means kids don't get the attention they need because teachers are saddled with extra paperwork.
My mom taught public school for 30 yrs. Common Core ruined her ability to give students the time/attn they required
Understand the distinction between "Common Core" and your local IMPLEMENTATION. I've read the CC...
@TheDemocrats dems need to keep poor kids in shitty schools to be sure they remain govt dependent& grow up to vote dem.
.@JoannaDamon2 @nvygrl84 @PattyMurray @TheDemocrats is it mandatory to be intellectually dishonest if you're a lib?
.@JoannaDamon2 @nvygrl84 @PattyMurray @TheDemocrats of course you could, never deal in facts when you can go right for cry of racism
he's using 30's Germany to address the libs penchant to throw darts rather than discuss
Shame St. George.  You don't call any woman "bitch" - you need to apologize.  No need to sound like trump.
It's not public education , its government indoctrination right now , say bye bye you whiners !

''(B)RING (B)ACK (P)RIDE (A)MERICA.!!!!
.@PattyMurray liberal education methods/schemes have dumbed down education in public schools, let's try it another way #NoOnMurray
but the teachers are determined e to teach. If the states would require more from the teachers. Students will learn.
thus, she gets in. Money talks
So sad to see this. Deplorable. #TheResistance #dictatorship #impeachtrump #NoOnDeVos
Republican senators &VP Pence disagree with P.Murray as they ear plugged the noise of constituents.People NO! Party yes w/win!

@TheDemocrats Thank You Betsy
Surprise! DeVos is now the leader in "tearing down public education"! Only surprise is if your kids go to public school.
Name one law DeVos pushed for in Michigan that resulted in improved educational outcomes for minorities.
. @PattyMurray about time. The public school systems is hurting all kids.
@TheDemocrats Shame the rich always seem to have priorities mixed up! We have so many less fortunate in need in our country!
Thank you @PattyMurray for leading the sensible outcry #NoOnDeVos; @ThomTillis @RichardBurr_DN - we in NC are WATCHING YOUR VOTE with ours.
Who holds voucher schools responsible?  The parents giving them the voucher!
@AIIAmericanGirI And what the heck have you done but llive the good life off the taxpayers' dime your whole life?
@VinoVince thank you for your voice of reason and your commitment to what's best for America
The unions are certainly getting their money's worth out of you.
@TheDemocrats Public education is poisoning our youth. It isn't educating our children and makes us the laughing stock of world
25 years in education. I've never seen someone less qualified for such a critical position. Thank you for supporting us!
maybe we need a new eye to fix broken public schools/common core.Cap hill pushes the button 4 same ole same every year. #fedup

This is the most frightening thing about this whole charade. Absolutely no senate check on Bannon and crew. https://twitter.com/SenFranken/status/828975579395477504 â€¦
Thank you for voting #NoOnDeVos. Thank you for standing up against an unqualified nominee for Secretary of Education.
@mch7576 Why won't you guys mention that she's a mercenary's fuckn sister? #dumpdavos
@mch7576
Patty:  c'mon, tell the truth.  Didn't you used to be on He Haw?
GOOD FOR BETTY DeVOS....NEEDS TO 
BE DONE....YOU LIBTURDS HAVE 
DESTROYED ED.IN AMERICA.
#NoOnDeVos Where is the 1 more @SenateGOP with the conscience to vote NO on #DeVos? #PublicEducationMatters
@TheDemocrats @senategopfloor @SenateGOP all Americans support public education. We want school for all kids - ADHF, DOwns etc
Get with the program you statist collectivist...teachers' unions are about teachers not educating children.. time for a change!
@tifftakesoff are you telling me you cannot convince one Republican to stand up for this don't let Trump win by letting them VP
Because "inheriting a fortune" makes you a bad person, right?
do we have a choice at this point? Can change it back if it fails. Public is failing. USA 30th in world
vote no on DeVos. Listen to the serious reasons why she is unqualified. Cross party lines fir the good of children!
that is a pretty broad stroke statement designed to cast DeVos in a negative light. How about backing it up
just say NO!
if I had the choice to put my kids in something other than public education, I would have. Public education is a failure.
? Public indoctrination?
Classic Silver spoon !
I think she's being helping kids in Michigan.  She's not a monster.
Good as public education and NEA teachers union has failed us for 50 years.
Did you know that charter schools eventually become public schools in Michigan? By law?
Of course you don't.
vote no to Devros!
Patty, do the Wahhabis support choice? Can you defend you position on the subject? Is this an exception? Da....
public schools are failing our children  cookie cutter method smothering intelligence
Should Sharia be allowed in American schools? Does it allow for choice? I'm confused?
@TheDemocrats she has also volunteered in public schools for 30 years. If she was so against ps did she volunteer in them?
Betsy is just another millionaire that is going to line her pockets with tax payor dollars
@TheDemocrats I've seen first hand teachers union hacks at work. They have zero accountability!
AND, Don't get me started on ESL schools!
disagree.  Current plan not great.
@SenateDems Look Around You have Failed our Kids .College Degree doesn't mean Shit .
I couldn't agree with you more! Vote no!
thank you!!
@TheDemocrats we pray you prevail
#NoonDeVos Keep up the pressure. Thank you
Public education is pathetic in our country right now!
@TheDemocrats I vote yes for her!!
@TheDemocrats Public Education FAILURE. It's time for private education & citizens to take control.
@SenateDems DeVos hmmm? Let's see keep indoctrinating voters to the Democrats Plantation or FREEDOM OF CHOICE?!
@SenateDems It's about time someone used their personal fortune to help America... Oh wait! Working like a BOSS & No Salary!

@TheDemocrats You people are unbelievable!! P. Murray another hateful/divisive Liberal.  Lots of blovating, no action!!
Thank you for sharing your considered opinion. This Washingtonian is proud you are my Senator.
#TaxReturns
Betsy deVos thinks she can buy her way into the cabinet but its our kids who would pay the price, @SenateGOP.
We CANNOT have religious  only education. It's a crime.
Thanks for fighting, keep it up! #NoOnDeVos
@TheDemocrats Please persuade some of the Reps of this. No need to follow party, do what is right for our kids!
@Headerop1 She believes only the rich should have education. The rest should do as they're told.
Poor Patty. Ppl like you can't grasp Already Wealthy ppl choosing to serve for country instead of to enrich themselves.
American public education = lowest rank schools in the world. 
Why are you even still in office?
@BettyOJ True but let's be precise. Being rich is not the same as having a career.
Socialist education? don't want it. Don't need it.
Her "inherited" fortune? She should have run for the US Senate than? Insider trading, pay for play, etc....#DenOfThieves
@tessady The Senate need to focus the same amount of energy on ALL of his picks!!
What Public Education, we are now 29th in the World and we spend the most money. Where has the $$ Gone??
maybe this is what is needed... the current system is failing our children!
Dear ALL @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP Your mailboxes are full. Let this be a blanket #NO to #DeVosvote Signed, Your EMPLOYER
thank you for leading this fight! #DumpDevos
@suejohnston56 What is in it for her?  Just pushing her Jesus thing?
@TheDemocrats "ME USED TO WALK IN SCHOOLS, EAT CHILDREN, & PLAY NOISY, METAL STICKS! SINCE DEVOS, ME JUST HUNGRY & BORED!"
How &why does Mien kampf Trump get pass fraud &corruptions plus Presidency!&Picked Swamp Rats 4 Cabinet!
@TheDemocrats we don't need an Education secretary who is so out of touch with public education
@TheDemocrats EXCELLENT!
Dismantle the Dept of Ed, and the Teachers Union, and offer people a choice. You have failed.
@TheDemocratshttp://reverbpress.com/news/eric-trump-just-slammed-taxpayers-for-97830-in-hotel-bills-on-a-business-trip/
CC killed education. You all let that happen. Sorry but parents want control back. #Cursive #schoolchoice
Y'all vote no or forget about driving home. People will be IN THE STREETS!
Thank you!
@TheDemocrats devos is our hero for education freedom
@TheDemocrats Sour grapes!
which is exactly what the right wing wants.
I am totally ok with doing away with public schools.
Yeah - our schools are doing such a great job - we wouldn't want to try something new now would we.
@SenateDems you mean marrying a rich guy who inherited money doesn't make you qualified to serve in the cabinet #trumpisnuts
@TheDemocrats Parents of black kids should not B forced to stay in terrible schools but should have the choice 2 go 2 great 1's
then get off your butt and work for us go for it
Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our students and teachers.
@TheDemocrats Public schools in black neighborhoods with teachers that don't give a damn about the kids should be closed.
thank you for standing up against her!
Private schools are a hell of a LOT BETTER than COMMON CORE!  Total BRAIN WASHING of our children!!!!
So insulting the majority who don't have her wealth or in the position to expect other than the best from our public schools.
@TheDemocrats we know put her ass under .
@SenateDems thank you for standing up and with all of us! #holdthefloor
@AllLeftNews Thanks for trying to stop her.
Thank you, Senator Murray! Keep fighting for us! #NoOnDeVos  #HoldtheFloor
when are you leaving office? Hurry up, the swamp stinks.
@LindsayGrahamSC @SenatorTimScott Vote #NOonDevos #Holdthefloor
Thank you, Senator Murray!
@TheDemocrats Wonder how many dollars in donation Patty has received from teacher's unions? Follow the money.
Bullshit. She's dedicated her life and fortune to helping CHILDREN!  You're dedicated to lining your pockets with union thug $
@TheDemocrats Thank you Sen. Murray for voting NO on DeVos. Our children need dedicated representatives like you
Hold the line.
@TheDemocrats Patty has taken a sizeable salary at taxpayer expense to pretend to care about public schools.
@TheDemocrats Patty has dedicated her career to the termination and dismemberment of unborn persons.
@SenateDems  one only needs to look at for profit "universities" to know what privatizing public education would turn into.
You evidently are dedicating your career to obstructionism.  You people need to get to work.
@TheDemocrats our public schools are the most expensive in the world and are totally unfairly funded and failing miserably
@TheDemocrats and buying her way into a cabinet appointment by the GOP
Stand Fast...one more vote
& public education is doing so well right? Especially in inner cities where education is key...Dems have FAILED!
@TheDemocrats if #GOP don't vote NO on #DeVos they r the ones we will hold responsible for destroying Edu n this country n 2018
@TheDemocrats Hope we can swing 1 more vote. Would a @GOP senator put their kids on plane with an plane inexperienced pilot??
@TheDemocrats you say that like it's a bad thing
.@PattyMurray Thank you for standing up for public education!
Doesn't matter she will do what ever Trump says
Do what you can to stop her and Trump!
Thank you!! Keep fighting! We're with you! #NoOnDevos #resist
The fact that the electorate made her confirmation possible suggests that public education hasn't been entirely successful...
@TheDemocrats Vote NO on DeVos!
If so bad? Why are test scores so much higher at these schools. WOW, something must be working vs. system of failure.
They're not higher. And in MI, charters do worse bec no standards thx to Devos.
@TheDemocrats DeVos I'd Buying the Republican Senators Grassley got over $21000 Alone!
Nice to be able to Buy a 
Job you are Unqualified for! DeVos is UNQUALIFIED,
It is Nice to Know How Much your Senator goes for! $2100 Buys Grassley!
Democrats want to tear down Charter Schools for better Education, to keep Status-qua America on GOV DEPENDENCY
you are 100% correct senator! !All she will do is widen the gap for the haves and have nots!!
Supporting you from Spokane!  Thank you to all the Dems.
@TheDemocrats Patty is one of the dumbest senators ever elected she wants to keep poor kids in bad schools
FACT 8th grade students reading on 1st grade level in #PublicSchools How do I know? I know the teacher. We need a change.
@TheDemocrats I'm ashamed of most of our public schools! We lag the rest of the world! If you are status quo it's time to go
who pays for private schools, white people. Looks like segregation is coming back. Thanks to GOP & their racist
Exactly.
@SenateDems Nice trick there; Throwing in the term "inherited" to imply she is privileged. You're unbelievably transparent.
But she IS privileged; her money IS inherited.
#TaxReturns
Which has nothing to do with anything. Crass class warfare. She's got $. Who cares how? #thick #ufell4it
Thank you Patty and Democrats for fighting for education for our future generations. #HoldtheFloor #NoOnDeVos
thank you for your words of affirmation of what we all (sane people) thought
@SenateDems thank you for saying no
HANG IN DEMS!  Resist!
Thank you! #holdthefloor
@SenateDems Stop spreading fear and misinformation.
@TheDemocrats We need a MAJOR change in educational system! We are LOSING! Sad, highest SAT scores were achieved home-schooled
@TheDemocrats Senator Murray, can you tell all of us which public school your children attended? I am assuming public schools.
@SenateDems What career? U give her too much credit. SecEd would be her 1st real job. And, she had to bribe her way into it!
oooo Patty, you're frightening us. Oooo, I have to find my therapy puppy.
best teachers I've seen in a long time were teaching students in our family online public charter high school
Thank you for continuing to fight this nomination! My students and I appreciate you!
that won't help anybody's kids. So glad mine are grown. Wouldn't want to have kids in school these days.
@SenateDems given we are at the top on costs, but near bottom on results, she may see something you dont
thank you for fighting for our children!
because public education is a shining star? And what's her fortune, inherited or not, got up do with anything?
thank you!  Keep public education for all children so they don't grow up to think this is normal.  #HoldTheFloor #StopDeVos
