When you know what you are fighting for, get back to us.
thanks for standing against American values for a demographic that also hates us. You guys are more transparent by the day
Oh, you'll fight with us...just not for cheaper drugs...because Pharma companies, right? You're not fighting with us.
.@PattyMurray How many Washington women's votes for Sanders did you disenfranchise as a Clinton superdelegate? 

(Hint: It's a majority)
just saw where? Citation?
@zachhaller @PattyMurray says a Pats fan that just got on Twitter, go back to sleep and save your energy for Super Bowl party!
WTH does that mean? Sounds like more pandering, divisive BS from you. Smoke and mirrors are your specialty. #Resign
Didn't she also vote against importing cheaper medications from Canada?
Bet that affected millions of women.
Women need affordable medicine too Patty.
terrible grammar. Needs complete overhaul. Nonsensical.
Thank you @PattyMurray. I feel blessed to live in a state so well represented by you and @SenatorCantwell
did anyone march for the rights of these two beautiful women? Kate and Marilyn.
Fight for what???!!! This whole thing is ridiculous!
you ladies lost the election, you are losers. #GetOverIt
Ummm, not a Dem! Thank you very much! And I will  #NeverGetTiredofWinning and #MAGA. So, I am no loser. 
Thank you Senator Murray!
Identity politics is destroying the dems! Keep it up! Whoohoo!
Nasty Woman supports Murdering Babies
We're your political backup back home, 175,000 patriots strong and representing many others <3
please do NOT accept #BetsyDeVos as the Dept of Ed candidate
Please save our children & vote NO on DeVos! She will destroy our schools! Totally unqualified! #DeVosHearing #NoDeVos
Good job - please don't let Betsy DuBos in as secretary of education - she is trouble for our public education system

How much did Pharma pay you?
Were you at march or just tweeting support like @HillaryClinton. #NoCore #OldStyle #ShallowFeminism #unwoke
Thank you for participating in the march today.  The fight is going viral.
What the hell do you think you are fighting now? Good Lord! We live in the best country in the world. Quit dragging us down.
Unless we're fighting against big pharma, right Senator?
You're losing.
We are women hear us roar!!
Did you fight for cheaper meds from Canada? Are you voting against Sessions?
@waitwait9 WE WILL.
NO NO NO on ACA "repeal and run" and NO on Betsy DeVoss!!!!
Really?  What do you plan on winning now?  Should have thought about winning one year ago.
We are tired of your fighting...Get to work & find some common ground
..so how's that been working for ya?
Well you should have tried that fighting thing before the election. ;)
you didn't fight for prescription drugs for your constituents, though. Only there for the empty photo op today. Get primaried
Except when the candidate is Hillary Clinton. Idiot. #tcot #WomensMarch
your Tweet was quoted in a story by @TIME
.@PattyMurray Female orcas need someone to stand for their rights too #TearDownThoseDams

Stop taking Big Pharma Money! Canadian Drugs safer than Nabisco from Mexico!
Way to go Patty!  Glad you represent us.
Prove you are serious, burn your bras -- while wearing them.
except that you failed to provide us with lower cost meds earlier this week. We've supported you but now we need answers
Truth! #WomensMarchOnWashington
Thank you for standing up to Trump and his tyranny.
thats more people for the march than his own Swearing in.
You only care about your donors not the ppl you are suppose to represent.
@annejowrites Keep an eye on him in the church basket too! What time march start??
They r giving speeches right now. Of course, they don't find women important enough to cover live.
So what will you win, Patricia? What is the prize you seek? What is your Utopia?

You suck. You don't defend women in Congress. You take cash from lobbies and make decisions on that basis.
regardless of your opinion one woman should not say to another ,"you suck". It is simply rude
I agree
