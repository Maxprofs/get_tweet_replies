Unbelievable
Absolutely disgraceful, and sickeningly hypocritical when considering their "family values" rhetoric - apparently ALL of THAT is lip service
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News because heartless cold blooded GOP don't care about health of unborn children or women?
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News GOP is clearly ready to be denied sex by any and all right thinking partners then.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News they were ready to sell their souls!
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News Why do Republicans hate women so much?
They have already sacrificed their honor, common sense, compassion. Not much left...
"Ryan the Face of A Wounded Dog"! Defeat for some means Vanish, good riddance! GOP? Not so fast! Vote!
" Is that the Republicans  NEW Pro Choice Position?
Reject Ryan Care... on that we agree.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News They are monsters.
so says the lady who sacrificed affordable drugs for campaign contributions.
What good is maternity care if no one can afford it? Kill the wretched abomination that is Obamacare. It is ruining the healthcare system.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News the dem ready 2 sacrifice  the people because they do not want 2 work together 4 good of the  people
Oh those pro-lifers are such good people.
please explain to me why I, a 42 year old male, can't buy a lower-cost plan that doesn't include maternity care
Because that's not how insurance works - its pooled risk -
I have absolutely zero risk of getting pregnant, so why am I in the pool?
I have absolutley 0 risk of prostate cancer - why am I in the pool? Splitting it up makes it more $$
is prostate cancer one of the #ACA mandated coverages?
I believe cancer coverage is - yes
but not specifically prostate cancer.
that's like arguing homeowners in Denver should be required to buy tsunami coverage.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News and they call themselves the "pro life" party, such a joke.
they're not pro-life. They are #probirth
pro-control, they feel entitled 2 make the decisions not the women who will forever b effected.
. @PattyMurray @CoryBooker @Rewire_News Patty time 2 stop being negative #workonit2gether
Step One Now go to work and FIX Obama care for the American People.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News don't let them take Health care away from our women!
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News while they're going after motherhood, maybe they should continue with baseball and apple pie.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News Thank you Trump women for being so supportive of a guy that just stabbed you once again in the back.
Get real, does a man or woman in their mid 60's need maternity car? Does a man need it period.?????
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News white women who voted R cutting access to birth control & maternity care. Check where your Rep stands
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News noooo are they crazy? Come on women lets move
NO! If they do VOTE THEM OUT
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News They should be castrated if they vote for this!
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News "Sacraficing" maternity care?? What is that suppose to mean? Maternity care is a sacrifice to the GOP!
Nice how all white MEN think they are capable of making decisions for all women.
@GOP is ready to sacrifice their soul to pass this hot mess. #KilltheBill #AHCADOA
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News  I'm a 60 yr old male. I should not be mandated to pay for maternity care
yeah you see I am 65 and don't need this coverage and a single man does not either so how is sacrifice
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News Their misogyny is formidable
Please consider this health care bill carefully. It will still leave thousands without health care. Vote NO. Please
This is insanity. Basically they want to replace Obamacare with more expensive NON care.They are gutless & soulless
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News We will accept his sacrifice, just not his bill.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News do it and see your reelection go down the tubes
Mandate penalty for not taking health insurance is BS. People will stop paying taxes.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News Disgusting
What do you say we have the biggest March against the GOP who's attacking us ladies? Enough is enough!
@corybooker Not at all surprised considering the GOP attitude torward effects of poverty, hunger, climate denial
Simply more "Pro-Life" hypocrisy amidst GOP, altho believe many pro-lifers are sincere.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News @iamfonda @HouseGOP is faced with reality @FoxNews poll shows only 17% are for #AmericanHealthCareAct
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News HELL NO!!!
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News hang in there dems!  Save the ACA!
@CoryBooker as a citizen relying on healthcare. These people are disgusting and heartless. To deny citizens of healthcare.
@CoryBooker @Rewire_News What do they think insurance is, you never know what coverage you'll need. You can't pick and choose.
And at the same time they pretend to be pro-life
Yeah "pretend" is the perfect description for what they are!!
@CoryBooker @SpeakerRyan @Rewire_News @SenateGOP @HouseGOP it is pathetic !
@sarahsophief @Rewire_News Heartless+irresponsible. They don't want women 2 have right 2 choose 2 be stay-at-home moms, either
Sacrificing maternity care is sacrificing the health of future generations.
I'll bet my house you haven't even read the bill. Just like you never read the Obamacare bill before supporting.
@mcmullan_gail @Rewire_News disgusting!
ugh
Shame on Ryan & those that would put pregnant women at risk for tax breaks for wealthy!!
Pray the Devil Back to Hell is an inspiring documentary, including women saying no to men
@PattyMurray @rowefinkbeiner @Rewire_News
Maybe if fewer Senators were beholden to BIG PHARMA these issues would go away.
oppose the GOP health care bill...oppose all their bills, please.
disgusting
@oufenix @Rewire_News no birth control coverage outlaw abortion and no insurance for maternity care
they are ready to do human sacrifice to satisfy tea-party lunatics
#MAGA #tcot @GOP russian spy criminal
The GOP is despicable - no Viagra for you!
GOP ready to sacrifice care to save their asses.
Ye gods. What is even left?
I think they would save more money if they just sacrificed ALL HC for men. 
hopefully women voters remember this in 2018
And feminized men too? 
So no b/c, abortion, maternity care or infant care. Sounds like men lose. #celibacy
@lahtay44 @Rewire_News hello women!!! You make up more than 50% of the voting population....Call and complain!!
I called my congressman @RepMikeCoffman
Pretty sick when this guy has two daughters and a wife.
Do all you can today to stop this asinine #GOP #Trumpcare. #SavetheACA Thank You @RepJayapal @PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell @Rewire_News
The opposition ads for 2018/2020/2022 write themselves. Right, @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems ? 
#prolifemyass
Vote it down!
Is there nothing they won't do? Integrity? Gone with truth I guess.
FYI...women_have_suffered_more_under_obama_policies_128564
@SpeakerRyan It appears the GOP and @realDonaldTrump willing to sacrifice ANYTHING to pass this. Agenda over people once again.
Scare Tactics. Patty, don't be used by your fellow Democrats - pls vote FOR AHCA!  Thank you!
Not taking anything away just not forcing people to buy it if they do not need it!
The SAME people who want to overturn Roe v Wade. Life is apparently not so precious. The hypocrisy is breathtaking.
I'm real.  This is our America???  Crying.
Advice:  get a life. Seriously.
women and children last with the GOP.
So how did that make them under Obama?
