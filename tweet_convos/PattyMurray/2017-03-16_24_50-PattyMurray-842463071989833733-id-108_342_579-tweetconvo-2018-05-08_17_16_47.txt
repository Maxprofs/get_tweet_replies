@TheDemocrats Trump budget=taxcuts for rich, middle class higher taxes and poor nothing but pain
We won't have arts or humanities or after school programs or environmental research, but we will have a wall. SAD
What're you on? Schools still do all of this stuff. This isn't Germany 1942. Go to a school and check
No this is America 2017.  Crazy tweeting President surrounded by enablers denies all about Russia
dude the president isn't crazy. Look in the mirror man.
People remember this is from the Eyes of the VERY LIBERAL LEFT who LOVE to Spend YOUR $$ to get elected
@TheDemocrats -When you say "immigrant ", you mean "illegal aliens", right? Sneaking across is trespassing, not immigration.
@TheDemocrats hmm well the college kids can join the military and get free college oh wait not these snowflakes can't handle it
@TheDemocrats since when did you ever give a shit about US taxpayers???
@PuyiHenry really what's ur basis for such a statements
bernie would have won.
@TheDemocrats I was born in the USA put us first for once
@TheDemocrats Since when did Patty Murphy start caring about taxpayers (beyond squeezing them for every cent she can)?
@TheDemocrats any one got a shredder for Trumps stupid amateur attempt at a budget
@FoxNews  Immigrant communities are the problem and I'm tired of my tax dollars supporting them. Send them home.
@TheDemocrats oh wait this generation wants Everton a silver platter they don't work for it. Entitled little snowflakes
@TheDemocrats why should I have to pay for someone's else's daycare. No know paid mine we worked opposite shifts to overcome
I'm tired of paying for people who refuse to get off there ass and get a job. Minimum wage was not intended to be a living wage
@TheDemocrats Immigrant communities? If they are illegal they need to go home, if here legally, they have it better than home!
@TheDemocrats It's all a question of priorities. Reduce income & wealth inequality, or increase inequality.
any budget that stops wasting money on illegals and lets taxpayers keep their own money is a good thing. @GOP @TheDemocrats
umm  rt
LOL-"alternative facts" from the regressive side. "Illegals" actually contribute to economy, unlike regressives.
Yes some do. The rest cost "taxpayers" BILLIONS!
Yeah, I'm not really sure about that...billions for the wall so that it can pretend to do something, but otherwise.
It will. Already the ppl trying to cross illegally has gone down sharply. I thank it will work
Uh? You realize the largest group of "illegals" is actually not from Mexico right? They fly in from Asia & Russia.
No. South America
LOL.  I know regressives like their alternative facts, but man, it gets old. I block regressives, life's too short.
that is bcs u r the first employers of illegal & legal emigrants
@TheDemocrats U need to make them understand They promised Cheaper Better tweek the ACA fix it & Dump TRUMPCARE which will hurt
In 8+ years your party hasn't done anything but create dependence on big govt. U hate everything because you lost
represents Patty Murray and her donors. We constituents get rhetoric but not the votes.
@TheDemocrats Sen Murray, it doesn't matter. As long as the rich are enriched, the GOP could care less. You should know this.
THRUMPH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU AND ME EVEN HIS FAITHFUL VOTERS HIS GAME IS FRAUD THE BIGGER THE BETTER, HE IS THE ONLY ONE #SAD
@TheDemocrats Democrats should stand up and get back the Senate or the House!
@TheDemocrats Every Dem in D.C is a master at raising money for themselves. Pick a cause & fund it yourself.
Take another look!!!! More FAKE NEWS from the party of lies!
That's what you worry about ,the Immigrants? You are pathetic! How about the citizens here? Who are legal citizens?
@TheDemocrats good! Let's take care of Americans first.
@TheDemocrats would you say anything different. Start working with the guy you may even get something you want.
@TheDemocrats we really don't give a damn about the immigration communities they're Muslim they won't death to America
and ACA has collapsed and was a big lie by democrats
NOT WHAT WE ELECTED HIM FOR WAKE UP DEM
This is a bad deal for taxpayers.
@TheDemocrats The Dems have to get more organized n step up their game. Your all slacking. Please fight harder. #ImpeachTrump
like i am going to believe you! take a hike
Senator Murray, Thank you for your tireless efforts to provide for the poor. I am proud that you represent WA !
here comes Patty with her fact manipulating. Immigrants belong here, illegal aliens do not. America first. Do your job Patty
@SenateDems https://twitter.com/erik6816/status/842684572789850112 …
@ArnoldLawson47 everyone says college. He needs to invest in public education teachers salaries r too low $35,000 a yr?
why invest in in private education n for profit charter schools whom in my area have show corrupt n failures
So good to have you on our side, Senator Murray! @realDonaldTrump #donthecon
be bolder in your statements
@SenateDems illegal or legal? Some dems are not able to understand the difference.
Trump has said he WANTS to rebuild some of our infrastructure. Didn't you know that?
Immigrants should NOT receive section 8 and food stamps.
@SenateDems Propose fixes to ACA, skip fighting Rep plan, its dead on arrival. Go on offensive!
unless you can come up with a plan to get us out of trillions in debt, this looks pretty good.
otherwise, how can you speak to the prob with no solutions.
.@PattyMurray @SenateDems That's all u can say? It's a  disaster in every dimension 4 our civilization. Trump is doing Putin's bidding.
@SenateDems
@SenateDems
@SenateDems  please explain why Dems communities are so poor for years? why now legal immigrant communities are important.
@SenateDems so what do dems contribute to help???
@SenateDems the best most dramatic government reforming budget ever proposed! #MAGA
@SenateDems What's new?
Actually his budget coupled with his regulatory policies will lead to one of the biggest job- creating eras the US has seen in decades.
@SenateDems its about time.
@SenateDems cost of illegals in us $99b a year. 1/5 the cost of wall and added security. Means saving almost $80b a year
@SenateDems so what can we do to stop it and not just report that we R being taken over by Dictators?
@SenateDems AND GOOD FOR OUR MILITARY, VETS AND MAKING US STRONGER THAN EVER. #middleclassSPOKE
@POTUS44 @POTUS @RussiaConnects @Pontifex @netanyahu crime free is crime free. @ILAttyGeneral who are we? USPS cult
in cloud of criminals intent to defraud©™®
screen act all! No exceptions & no excuses©™®
frauds to withholding properties taxed crimes
@SenateDems How?
Learn to spell...
his budget is harmful to humans, animals, plants, space, air, water, did we leave anything out?
HIMSELF!
You are truly a great reason to have term limits!
Ma'am, what is your relations to #Soros ? George Soros to be more precise, what is your relationship with his organization?
WHAT?!?...see, your first line says IT ALL...you again and again put illegal immigrants ahead of #AmericaFirst ..#BoycottMurray
U do remember that u r in DC 2 represent WA State citizens right?
.@PattyMurray 19 TRILLION in debt, you own it Patty, you and your Dem cohorts, get over yourself and govern, this isn't hard it's just math
Do U read ur tweets, Patty? I do. U really mean ILLEGAL communities. We  Legal Immigrants. Need more than 140 characters. 
Thanks for pushing Hillary Clinton instead of Bernie. Sure paid off. You're a garbage Democrat.
you never talk about our vets. Sad honestly.
I'm confused - The very first item in the pic is about #veterans and support for their #healthcare.
I think she talks about vets quite a bit - & constantly votes to protect them from regressive policies.
She talks...A LOT....no actions IMHO...at all...
Blocking regressive anti-veteran policies is all Dems have been able to do for a while...
<-- She's been in D.C. since '92!!!... and she talks about change and NOT being the est
I just went to your twitter page - my eyes hurt from the misinformation. I block regressives
Not just the Immigrant community but the Elderly,  climate. People and Earth for God's sake.
The poor and middle class will be hurt be health costs especially seniors.
A vast understatement ...
Why didn't Obama reduce the cost of college?
Hurtful to those most in need, to The Arts, Humanities, exception is the Elite class he protects and panders and owes money to!
What exception?
.@PattyMurray listen to this song from Irish Christy Moore-Ordinary Man https://youtu.be/LIh5dUOz824 , isn't it #Trump's vision of #USA's future?
