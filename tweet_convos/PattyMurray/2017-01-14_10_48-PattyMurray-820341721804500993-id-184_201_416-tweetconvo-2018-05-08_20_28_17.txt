If Republicans repeal the #ACA, rip apart our health care system & damage Medicare & Medicaid w/ it, women in will bear the greatest burden.
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, today women are more in control of their health care and their lives than ever before.
The progress we've made is at stake & now, Rs have also announced that they plan to defund @PPFA as part of their effort to repeal the ACA.
Defunding @PPFA would have big consequences for millions of women & men who have relied on it for cancer, STD screenings, HIV tests, & more.
But, Senator Murray, there are many of us that don't believe that the Progressive party made any progress at all.
When real progressives govern we wont have backlash. Patty not progressive but corporatist, center-right
Patty is a Democrat, Democrats are progressive and out of touch with main stream America.
"out of touch progressive" is an oxymoron. Most Americans support true progressivism
No they don't, if you get outside your progressive cocoon you'd see that.
The only case you can make is that most Americans support progressive agenda but sometimes most voters do not
so the "progressive" legislators overrule the will of the voters by passing reg. rules and laws not wanted by voters
1/2 Can't argue facts with someone refusing 2 review the data I provided from 4 polls
@realDonaldTrump Progress down socialist, lawless path is not my kind of progress. Country saved 11/8/2016. Wash state-wake up!
You mean because 2thirds of 8th graders can't read.your the PROBLEM along with the union's who donate to DEMOCRATS you lost
Progress for who?! Not for the middle class or poor! You're kidding yourself!
you rats hurt our families & country with your anti American agenda. We won't forget. We will roll back ALL the mess you made.
Obama: "If you don't like my policies, go out and win some elections". GOP: "OK".
That's literally what Senator Murray did you halfwit.
Correct. She literally watched her party lose governorships, statehouses and WH, House and Senate. #SteakKnives
@ACatholicKnight  what progress?? Forcing people to get healthcare with high premiums is not progress!! How about #termlimits
U put the intere$t$ of ur donors b4 ppl politically expedient 2 support ACA coz doesn't conflict w/ 
http://bluevirginia.us/2017/01/democrat-vote-cheaper-priced-drugs-canada …
you are other sell outs like you are the reason we have TRUMP - how about standing up for the people instead of corporations?
Announce u will not attend Trump inauguration.  Give Trump (the Birther) the same recognition of legitimacy he gave to Obama.
@mydogtristan What Progress do you speak of?
Patty, We Washingtonians expect you to stand with John Lewis and boycott the inauguration. Be courageous. Don't attend!!!
- You are not helping with your recent vote on prescription meds.  I voted for you to help us, not maintain the status quo.
not ONE step BACK
Very good <they  can't say not or si.It is together !
sad to see political proselytizing vs. getting to work w Trump on common ground. Stop bellyaching & work w @realDonaldTrump!
@SharylAttkisson the left believes in fantasies like that ACA has worked that it is affordable -
@SharylAttkisson "Progress"? That's one way to put it.
please stop taking money from Big Pharma so you can fight for lower prescription costs
@SharylAttkisson Any chance of hearing specifics?
@SharylAttkisson And what "progress" would that be, Senator???
what a waste of our representation you are. #TermLimits #draintheswamp
needs to drain the swamp. You are one that needs to go! #TermLimits #draintheswamp #wastatesenatorswaste
don't think they really know the meaning of 'progress'
All Democrats MUST BOYCOTT Trump inauguration. John Lewis IS RIGHT.
you sold us out when you voted no on Sanders' bill 4 cheaper drugs! Your 477K from Pharma=30 pieces of silver. U lost my vote
So why did you vote against the importation of less expensive prescription drugs from Canada?  No friend of the people!
You voted against progress when you joined the republicans to kill Bernie's bid to cut Rx prices.
Voted for you,  but appalled by your support of big pharma 
@SharylAttkisson patty I lost my insurance policy because of the #ACA! That was progress?
why didn't you bring them in during the design? #backroomdeals
What progress?
we need to get our drugs out of Canada!  We can't pay USA prices that buy our politicians to line their pockets
Where the HELL were all y'all for BERNIE ??
why did you vote against Bernie and prescription drugs Senator Murray!!!!
@SouthJewishWman You voted against lower drug prices so you are not much better. Voting like you did damage's the Democrats.
@SharylAttkisson progress?
@SharylAttkisson higher insurance costs, larger deductibles, fewer choices, sounds like progress to you libtard?
@SharylAttkisson you should have read the ACA before! Voting .. what you got was Pandora's box!
MAGA!!!
what happened to you Rep. Murray? You came from obscurity and have turned into a partisan hack. Return to the people.
Please continue to work to #SaveACA and reduce cost of pharmaceuticals! GOP effort to repeal ACA & prohibit imports is awful!
<-voted vs best interest Even Reps voted 2 lower drug cost It's all about furthering her donors' agenda!
Shoving CRAP down & upon U.S. is HARDLY PROGRESS & SHAMEFUL.!
This is exactly why you failed & will be remembered next elec 2
@SharylAttkisson Premiums up 3X, deductible higher by more than 2X, higher out of pocket, less choice this is "PROGRESS".
@marcylauren very very disappointing
@SharylAttkisson  America is divided against each other. You call that progress ? U need a new dictionary !
Thank you Patty! Stand strong!
I'm just going to leave this here
Thanks for your hard work to save ACA and women's health
so you support murder if the place doing the murdering also does good things. Interesting justification.
@SharylAttkisson   Because your "progress" is anti-Constitutional. We're America, you all are not!
@SharylAttkisson ACA raised cost of insurance, insurers exiting, docs  refusing new patients, meds prices up.
Being on the wrong track is not progress.  Real progress begins on 1/20/2017.  We won. Take a nap for another 8 years.
Planned Parenthood is Progress?
Only if killing offspring is progress.  #DefundPP
sound bites patty. No substance
As a Democrat it hurts me to say this but you are so full of it. You vote agst Klobachar amendment & u & the other weak Dems gave us Trump
Thinks she's progressive but is center-right. If her & Obama had been truly progressive there wouldn't be backlash

Any more "progress" and I'll be living under a HIGHWAY BRIDGE SOMEWHERE.
@SharylAttkisson The problem with these far left socialist is that you can not unstupid stupid! They just double down on it!
Far left??Murray wouldn't know left if it bumped into her. Far left is where the people are
"Progress"
if not for the $$$ cap removals of the #ACA, I would be DEAD. To those who say it's too expensive, what's your life worth?
@dgraz007 Hypocrite! Why did u vote against re-import of brand name drugs from Canada? Because you're #1 recipient big pharma
yes that sucked! Even I get some from Canada. Now our prices will go up again
Repubs want to take away funding for birth control. Are we supposed to trust that men will be prepared? What a joke.
@SharylAttkisson 

Soon Trump will have a pen and a phone!
What a joke
so why did you get in bed with big pharma?!
@SharylAttkisson Elections have consequences...damn Russians. Voter ID would have stopped those "Ruskies" in their tracks!
Failed policies not "left"Obama & Murray are neo-Lib corporatist like Romney/Trump, differ only on social issues
@SharylAttkisson bwahahahah, you lose, we won.
@SharylAttkisson yep fixing your globalist sell out of America #MakeAmericaGreat 
@SharylAttkisson I see we've really ignored mental health in America. These people need help. 
#MAGA
@SharylAttkisson Talk about delusional.
thanks to your "progress" I have less money, less work opportunities, less safety and less security. You can keep your progress
@SharylAttkisson Sort of like the dems did in rolling back 200 years of history in the past 8 years.
you should boycott the inauguration.  Trump does not respect the office...u shouldn't respect his disrespect.
give them hell, Patty!
Kill babies= progress?
Progress. You have got to be kidding. If these past 8 yrs is what the democrats call progress, never elect another one.
How much $$$ has @PattyMurray  accepted in past several years from Big Pharma? Answer=Almost half a million $.
Thanks for working so hard for us.
@SharylAttkisson exactly what "progress" are you referring to?
Progress? Let's see, the VA?--Nope. Economy? Nope. Fix ACA? Nope. Useless pandering drivel emanating from your office? #Yup
@SharylAttkisson  Republicans not allowed to run the U.S They can only build on what dems see as their progress? #arrogantf****
@SharylAttkisson Profiting from the sale of aborted fetuses isn’t “progress,” Senator.
@SharylAttkisson poor little cupcakes
@SharylAttkisson what progress,  I didnt get to keep my doctor and my premiums have gone $4500 a year. #progressyeahright
@SharylAttkisson Obamacare is broken and pretty much dead, why haven't you done anything so far? You are lying to Americans.
and the progress for prescription drugs you voted against #Shame
It makes sense Patty if you take money from drug co they support you you turn around and Support them not the people you serve
You're there because you kill babies. Tell it like it is
many IC sufferers cannot afford ins or the penalty. Have heard this from many. Rx is not affordable
More progress like this and we'll be paying the Dr. with chickens.
@SharylAttkisson Murray just another Lib with NO values principles or morals #MurrayHypocrite
@SharylAttkisson That's not progress. 8 years of degrading liberty, bankrupting the nation and promoting illegal acts.
debt to GDP ratio devalues currency. Even for countries that print their own money.
Inflation result of overspending. deficit result of over-investment, = to surplus in private econ
while the Fed has kept interest rates at unbelievable lows.
@SharylAttkisson And because you obtained that progress without the will of the people, it will be easy to undo.
. That's it...play the woman card! Why were men more in control of their health care than women without ACA?
Keep on fighting for what's right Senator. I will support you.
@SharylAttkisson that's what they get for ramrodding it down our throats even though most Americans didn't want it.
. Progress? Two percent growth, $19 trillion in debt, sky rocketing health ins premiums! Some progress! Go GOP go!
@SharylAttkisson Progress? You think hi premiums & deductibles, limited access, increase in burden on business NOT progress.
@SharylAttkisson
correction, they are here to clean up obama's mess
you mean the way you voted.tk keep.cheaper Canadian drugs.out of the country !!!
lucky you you really have no worries due to the excellent med coverage you have. Any campaign donations from pharmaceutical co?
how's your med insurance going? Pretty good coverage? You need to do more. I voted for u now step up.
@SharylAttkisson Elections have Consequences,  where did I heat that before?
answer to the dark shadows casting over you. Have you taken money from pharmaceutical companies
@SharylAttkisson No Patty we are trying to undo all the damage you have done over the last 8 years!
Define progress!!!
Can you explain what progress we don't want to pay for the transgenders plastic surgeries & abortions we WANT fairness for all!
Umm, wouldn't transgendered, by definition, be part of any "all" seeking fairness?
Oh I want to get new boobs please can u send me the money is only $7000
You're joking right? ACA will only cover Boob job deemed medically necessary (criteria exists)
You need to educate your self what Ocare really covers and they cover the transgenders plastic surgeries I'm not against them but work & pay
So your beef with ACA is it incentivizes freeloading & gender reassign surgery is your example?

@SharylAttkisson Get used to it.  Your "progress" was destructive.
@SharylAttkisson How do those that you represent feel?
ThisConstituent thinks you clowns haven't seen progressive. Murray's milktoast-to-right-of center
You seem nice.
Thank you, but I merely speak the truth, regardless of where the chips land.
@sharylattkisson 
Senator, you misspelled betrayal.  It doesn't start with a "p".
PS - Planned Parenthood saves lives
With the ACA planned parenthood is redundant! Get those services through your insurance!
Thank you Patty! Glad I voted for you!!
What you call "progress" the nation calls a catastrophe. That's why Trump is going to be president starting next week.
as directed by the American people
Anti-fili clause in law invalid procedure. Congressional rules are set by rules, not by statutes. Unenforceable.
@SharylAttkisson SERIOUSLY,What Progress? Race Relations/Full Time Jobs/Healthcare Costs/Public Safety/Middle class/ ALL DOWN!
you are still out of touch with the ppl! 2010 elections, continued majority against ACA. Just keep in not listening patty.
@SharylAttkisson Stopping the sale of baby parts?  I thought Trump was pro business...?
@SharylAttkisson did you read the ACA before you passed it?It's just another way to fleece the US taxpayers. #WhatProgress
Define progress.
@SharylAttkisson another lie
what progress?  obamacare was a huge failure., you're just too stupid to care.
...You just joined them in voting down amendment that would've helped make RX drugs more affordable. What game are you playing?
more like cleaning up the mess you progressives made!
Uncountable foreign policy dumpster fires,Iran not even near as bad as will get&domestic hopelessness.#Change
@SharylAttkisson No, they've begun efforts to fix all the damage you've done to our healthcare system, among other things.
@SharylAttkisson. Dems destroyed healthcare...Trump is gonna try and piece it back together
As a  woman I do not feel that way at all about  President Elect Trump. Why do you continue to support a false narrative?
Patty Murray represents corruption and fraud.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjCs_gvImyw …
@SharylAttkisson Progress? We make a very good living and can no longer afford HC. All of our Drs have retired because it also!

Your progress didn't get me a job, lower healthcare costs, or a country as respected and feared than before.
Agree! But rather respect than fear. Obama's done enough 4 the  2 consider as terrorists.
@SharylAttkisson 18 of the 23 exchanges have been shut down.  Costs are increasing. ACA is an abomination.  #clueless
@garfield_paula continue the progress #dumpdevos #repealESSA focus on what CAN impact!   Stop bipartisan attack on pub ed.
But. But. But... The PEOPLE didn't want your "progress", therefore you LOST the election. :)  #MAGA
@SharylAttkisson More fear mongering from the radical left. ACA was sold on a lies which @POTUS constantly repeated. Repeal it!
You are there today because your socialist ideas suck and a the vast majority dislike you and you are trying 2 save face #FIFY
Govt run anything is a disaster. Stay out of our lives.
Rep priorities pretty ugly. Dems however, by worshipping at altar of corp dollars, say nice things vote otherwise
@E_VanEvery Please #boycottinauguration! We must show our dissent for this horrific turn of events.
Well, millions were HORRIFIED when obama won. Now it's your turn. Just be classy like we were, OK?
.@Scandicat Here's just one page to discount your claim of "classy". I could do this ALL DAY: http://jezebel.com/5958490/twitter-racists-react-to-that-nigger-getting-reelected/ …
.....don't be so hasty, you might like whats coming a lot better................................
@SharylAttkisson 
What you call progress is why Trump got elected.
If Democrat ideas are so great why did the public overwhelmingly reject them in 2010, 2014 & 2016. @SharylAttkisson
Like fatting the lamb before the feast; we're just fatting the liberal tear ducts for inauguaration day drinks
A $12,000 healthcare deductible is not progress its theft, bad policy and ultimately unaffordable. @SharylAttkisson
It's progress for all of those put on Medicaid who pay nothing! The rest of us have to suffer.
Damn straight!! Full speed ahead!
: @PPact shirts and "progress" do not belong in the same tweet. @PPFA kills lives. They do not progress them. @SharylAttkisson
@SharylAttkisson so much awesome progress aborting babies? Sickos
You lost over 1000 democratic seats under the "obama rigged" white house. Are you that dense?
And now he's gonna stick around and be "vocal". LOL!! Soon the demz will run him outta town :)
@SharylAttkisson What progress Murray, come look at what I live on today because you gave my earnings to nee-do wells!
What Progress? @SharylAttkisson
@SharylAttkisson Good cuz you "progressed" my rates up 37% and doubled my copay and deductibles.
Do you represent ALL of Washington state or just those in line with your own beliefs? #repealobamacare as fast as you can!!!
I am a resident of Washington State, and @PattyMurray represents me, my family, and our values. Thank you @PattyMurray!
telling all poor people they are victims and they should get gov money is just wrong.poor people make poor decisions. I poor
if u knew how to create jobs why havent u guys done it? All u did is ask for more welfare money
progress isnt getting more money for ur pockects from taxpayers. And blackmailing companies with regulations
