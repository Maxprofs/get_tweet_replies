Appreciated joining @POTUS for meeting with the Freedom Caucus again today. This is it. #PassTheBill 
@MaddowBlog if it weren't for the suits I would have thought this is Saudi Arabia or something...
Wait a couple years.
there's no substantial difference between these ppl & the taliban.
These people are better fundraisers
they just have richer marks for their cons.
A rare look inside GOP’s women’s health caucus-Whats wrong with this picture? Again, why would any woman vote for Republicans?
Katty when MSM quits following everything POTUS does his "bilking"  might be missed. But you don't pay taxes. You are a paid Troll bye block
-it was just a meeting with another group., lots of different groups meeting. You've done nothing but complain, no help at all.
More than @cathymcmorris
much more than.
@DonCheadle why are there no women there deciding on women's health care, men don't and can't decide on women's health issues!
Yeah Patty is the Scion of Intellectuality in the Senate...
@josephamodeo  One does not have to be female 2 have important ideas for healthcare.Really tired of you all segregating people.
I'm sure they have wives, mom's,grandmothers,daughters, and others whom they care about & want good healthcare 4
The what?
Saw that earlier. Not one woman there. We are in trouble.
because liberal women just trash the conservative women!
Are you saying there are no women because they're afraid 
they will be criticized? 

@Kayluvsredwings @StephCaponigro @PattyMurray
look at what they did to Sarah Palin. I'm no fan of hers but she got trashed
What does coverage of a vice presidential cabinet have to do with a womanless panel? 

@Kayluvsredwings @StephCaponigro @PattyMurray
uh she's a republican and she wasn't simply 'covered' she was ridiculed. It was very sexist imo
But again: What does any of that have to do with a health panel with NO women on it to speak to women's issues? @Kayluvsredwings
#My2Vents we need a #PlotTwist in health care. Create State and local Hospital Districts  population to operate as #HMO #PuntWW
@allisonbgriffin classy language
@randallaustx   This is the women's health caucus?  It looks like all men!!!  
@MaddowBlog looks eerily like a waiting room for a Viagra prescription.
The Reason is that there is no Barlz in this group, they also sub for the Make America Great Again Team
@POTUS @VP  where are the women?
@CarlsbadDreamin  how dare a bunch of old white guys make decisions about women's health issues. It's nauseating.
well men's health isn't politically correct
Is it really rare?  #wherearethewomen is a forever issue. And these are the people - men who will make decisions for me. Sad!
you are amazing. I don't know if this bothers me as much as the 53% of white women that voted for this crew.
"Guys, the reason we're here is to agree on which sammich we want our wimmin to bring us from the kitchen".
Don't see one female in the bunch!
do you meen in trying to not give us women heath care
@pdamerica 
At least  they care about the Unborn!!!
.@chillinginLV @PattyMurray @pdamerica ...if only they cared after they were born.
. @chillinginLV @PattyMurray @pdamerica and ... if only they cared enough so women could achieve a healthy pregnancy.
...@chillinginLV @PattyMurray @pdamerica though evidence shows they do not-what truly makes you think they care about unborn?! #rhetorical
Clearly, imagining issues associated with 'female parts', makes them experts, right? Male control of women HAS TO STOP, NOW! #womenpower
You're saying it's women's fault powerful men shut women out of the decision-making process?
Women are half the voting power. If you want power, get elected.
strong tweet
How do you figure? They are elected officials deciding what to do with tax dollars. How is this hard to understand by people?
@allisonbgriffin
I see a lot of boobs, probably quite a few pussy's too.
@VP @POTUS  What I think f this gang of #WhiteMen
@Martina un F'ing believable.
@SenateDems a bunch of old white men deciding on women's fate! Shame on them!
And their age. Don't forget their age!
my dad was from Glasgow so whether we agree or disagree tho prob agree my will forever b towards my dads homeland
Yup. Americn Taliban. Radical Christian Xtremists. Against women & minorities rights, education, personal liberty, healthcare, life on Earth
Sad the so-called "Freedom" Caucus group doesn't have representation from women & people of color.  Freedom is for all, right?
, freedom FROM women, obviously!
@MaddowBlog I see a lot of pussies in that room, but no women. Strange.
Love it!
Or you could all just pay for your own shit, if not then yes ELECTED officials will be decided what tax dollars fund. You should know better
@skywaker9 2002 called . . .
Is the caucus to discover what a woman actually is?
@bannerite 
Yeah, not a female in sight.
unacceptable
I love the smell of Estrogen in the morning
It was the freedom caucus, not a women's health caucus.They are all elected-get some women to run!
A poignant reminder of the need for more women/Minority representation. A tweet won't solve that. Running for offices might.
look at the big group of white men who can't legislate their way out of a wet paper bag. Good work! Keep it up.
a very diverse group of voters, some have no hair, some have black hair, one has brown hair
Aussie would never stand for this disrespect of women. But what else can one expect from the trumpet. Stand up to it.
has anybody said "cockus" yet? If not... First!
When women stop marching in Labia costumes & claiming their moral compass is in vagina, more people will have trust2elect them.

Sadly, a lot of women voted4 this! #shameful #Prolife in slogans only Deeds speak louder than words
A group of men gathered together to decide women's health issues without a woman in sight. How can they not see thats a problem
Patty, how can we get women on this committee?
I want to see all Democrats and Republicans working on health care for the American people you all say you care so show us
Finally, the real #deathpanel is revealed! #trumpcare #ahca
Eerily similar to this
You all need to sit down together and fix this for the American people .None of you are on Obama care you all were exempt
remember that Washington State has two woman representatives voting yes on #AHCA 
@cathymcmorris @HerreraBeutler
@MaddowBlog WOW, so happy to see so many WOMEN at the table to give their thoughts to this meeting said no one ever. #Ryancare
@Bob_Casey @SenBobCasey this is who @gop @SpeakerRyan @POTUS are hurting. #seniors #MealsonWheels
so sad
if any knows vaginas it's those guys!!!!
Thanks for sharing. There's some mighty rough looking women there. Oh wait..it's all men. Bet they have our welfare at heart.
@MaddowBlog makes my blood boil!
agreed obsurd, but maternity leave is not primarily "women's health" it is "baby's health". Wish this perspective would change
@SenBobCasey Interesting.  All white middle age men making the decision around women's healthcare.  #TermLimits
Gee, reminds me of 'Saudi Arabia launches girls' council - without any girls' http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39264349 … Not shocked.
#SaveACA
We need women in government stat!

again nothing good ever comes out of a room full of dicks. On top of that they lack color. This is dangerous to women's health
thanks for sharing
Where are you in photo?
#AHCA= No#EssentialHealthcareBenefits Cut#MaternityCare add#MomTax 
NOT#SoMuchBetter
that's is the freedom Caucus, can you even read... they are discussing the bad healthcare bill that shouldn't pass #FullRepeal
so unheard of only having one woman in the board room...liberals need to stop with the identity politics. It doesn't work.
not a surprise - i hope the boys club gets an earful from women in their lives #healthcare
@VP @POTUS Not a single woman present for the Woman's Caucus? Have you no shame or honor?
TY for representing me so we'll. You'll always have my vote
this funny... but also makes me sad.
@bkindivisible @VP @POTUS Horrifying.
Are the Women out getting the coffee and donut holes?
not an ounce of estrogen among them  !
So seems Senator Murray is willing to be apart of the new healthcare act. Or maybe she is just a whiner.
so diverse! So representative!
We are so sick of men making these decisions for us.  Has to STOP.  TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
all I see is a bunch of dudes in togas.
.@PattyMurray Thanks, Senator Murray, for showing us the white men controlling women's bodies. Come on, let's fight back!
And thanks to the great Sara Paretsky for standing on the front lines of battle.
I wonder what @VP feels when he looks around the room and sees only men at the table - proud?
disgusting -
I wonder if men would like an all women panel deciding on their health coverage.
unbelievable AND totally unacceptable.  When are the next elections??? Just kidding.  I know!
A bunch of dicks deciding Women's healthcare is like putting a fox in a henhouse. Corruption at its finest. #TrumpNeedsToGoNOW
@3DogCouch "We'd love to let women in our tree house (meetings), but then we'd all get cooties.
thanks. FYI. All the women in the photo are in drag.
THEN SHOW UP UNINVITED!!! crash the party! make a scene! DO SOMETHING... just blasting out a tweet CLEARLY isn't enough *sigh*
this is crazy
it's raining men.....
Stop this idiotic premise against men just because. Stop trying to pick a fight for everything. Contribute, get involved, do!
this is beyond wrong!
Most qualified OBGYNs are Male, I'm sure men do know a thing or two about female health. Most surgeons r male, is that wrong?
@MaddowBlog @VP @POTUS 
please learn how to be a strong independent woman and not a sad pathetic one who blames men for everything
your one of the reasons Trumps in the WH
your right there should be 2 of every race and color, as well as foreign s, how about little people,
Nicely done, Senator!
why are there no women in this meeting to discuss women's health issues?
ABSOLUTELY APPALLING!!!
if Viagra was on the list how many would remove it. None because they all look like they need it.
Did all of the men in the room have the women who need healthcare make sandwiches for them? It's a shame!
Were you there?  Where are the women? Where is Dr. Ben Carson?
The "Daddy State" -> GOP old white guys making all decisions for all women & girls since we're just objects & chattel to them.
Sick of arrogant old white men thinking they are the deciders! Thanks for all you do, Patty.
Freedom from Women Health Caucus?
@IndivisibleTeam @VP @POTUS The GOP will be getting a rare look inside their wive's blouses, if they screw up their healthcare
this is why government should have nothing to do with healthcare. you passed the ACA to get this started
delicious snark and epic shade. well done. @PattyMurray
We need more representation by women like you if we ever expect fair representation about our own health!
face palm
Nice!
@mblazoned @VP @POTUS So many men, not a single pair of balls. Shame on you.
Looks a little like this @PattyMurray
Same old, old!  Same mend sets as pushing to overturn Roe while cutting out maternity provisions of health care!
No women ;and they said Obama was bringing Sharia law. Lol
@sacca let's say they all hate their wives, don't any of them have daughters or grand daughters???
@AntonioDrumsX - my mental image of " Freedom " isn't this!
@samwhiteout  "Women's" Health Caucus?! Where are the women???? 
No women there?
And not a woman in sight. #Goodoldboysclub
@SenateDems @VP @POTUS Right all men lets not let that b the norm on this healthcare bill.Keep fighting for the women of USA!
this exactly why you need to vote against this flawed bill when it is your turn.
.@PattyMurray absolutely horrible. They have no conscious, no morals, and NO RIGHT to take health care away from women
that's a lie stop twisting things stop being such a child grow up
We say if maternity I'd not fully covered neither should prostate cancer. No birth control then no ED drugs. Stop the bullshit.
@sacca they all look beautiful.  I like their dresses. #Stunning
. Why would Nunes go first to Ryan first?   He violated his oath.    He lost his integrity.
SAD.
that's either a lot of closeted trans gender women, or, you know... There should probably be more women
maybe step up some and then you get invited to the big table
what i would really like to see is the picture of you voting against Bernies pharma reform bill.
unfortunately not funny
@peterwsinger reminds me of this "girls' council" in saudia arabia
@VP @POTUS 

This, This is what he means by "MAGA". The rich white men will make the choices. They will for all women and races.
right unbelievable
where are the WOMEN?? 
@NJCitizenAction Not one woman on the panel, pretty disgusting in my opinion!
@markwellsrector An insult to all women!
unbelievable.
@markwellsrector they probably took that opportunity to run through their multiracial & multicultural legislative agendas too.
It's sad that in 2017 we still see this happening. It's a not so subtle reminder that we still have a long way to go.
@VP @POTUS every women should be dismayed by this....
oh well..get over it!
@CarolynMcC and not one woman present to discuss it. How forward r thinking, NOT!
shameful
What's missing from the GOP Women's Health Caucus??? Smh
This is horrible! Where are all the women? #WomensRights #womenshealth #WomensMarch #TheResistance
You, Senator, are fierce. I salute you. #TheResistance #DonTcare
it's particularly heartening to also see the participation of people with #Disability and color in the discussion as well
Pretty sure they thought they were going to the Male Pattern Baldness meeting.
@realDonaldTrump just in line with Republican  mindset "what do women know about women's health"
2017!!! rich old white dudes dictating women's health... we are screwed.  #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@mmmMeggie There literally wasn't a single woman? It's ridiculous & immoral.
@aravosis   Appreciate you Senator Murray
how do they really feel about their wives, daughters, mothers? This is a hate/Discrimination bill leave our #ObamaCare alone!!
- looking in from UK this looks like the ultimate male caucasian establishment club. Not exactly a pic of swamp draining! 
.@PattyMurray and this is why the team pictured should NOT be in charge of women's health care!
God bless you Patti
That is some first class trolling right there. Benefits from being devastating, infuriating and true.
every time Potus tweets, we read again he was beat.  Family & staff appear bigly inbred, publishing small talk in their heads.
A picture is worth a 1000 words and I hate the fact I see all men working on this women's issue. TYVM #resist #womenfirst
