Instead of working with us to implement #ESSA, @BetsyDevosEd’s budget proposal would continue work started to undercut it.
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVosED Why is it these conservatives say they want poor off assistance then dump their education into toilet
They want Americans to turn as stupid, ignorant and corrupted as they are.
This women deserves to be cared for in her old age by students she denied a proper education. Karma is often invisible- but it's out there.
Ahhhhhh!
shutdown dept of ed.  give money 2 states.  term limits 4 ALL politicians.
I'm guessing your state didn't value it much......
Its. Not ok. Its all about greed
This is not right ...That woman is every bit as ignorant as the loser who's playing #POTUS.  #EpicFail
http://tinyurl.com/jmg8xco  Sen Cotton Received Nearly $1 Mil To Oppose Iran Deal. http://tinyurl.com/jnzubtl  Rubio Took $100K from DeVos  Yawn
So get lawmakers to stop the siphoning off of #taxdollars.  @betsydevosED is a white collar #thief.  #trumpfailure #loser #yourefired #gop
All 1 would have to do is look at Statistics of Education inUnited States & our ranking in the World, Our education system failed miserably
You do understand those #s reflect scores of ALL students in USA, other countries exclude less able students so they don't take the tests
More $$ thrown at failing public schools is idiocy! I support @BetsyDeVos in her plan to reform education with more choice & fiscal sanity.
Shameful!!! What can stop her? Do states have to make that $ up?
Please fight hard against this budget. It will devastate schools and children around the country!
Robin Hood in Reverse! I have a few choice words for them.  #DUMPTRUMP
Abolish the US DoE and you don't have to worry about this
Very insidious social engineering. How come DEMs don't have a clear and loud opposition to this GOP exploitation of ill-informed public?
See already poor MI schools and communities even more devastated by her brand of string-free private money. #GOP must examine this closely.
Hopefully they will continue to dismantle the teachers union. That will help children.
Impeach Trump, he works for Putin.
Betsy is an ignorant disgrace. Please stop her.
Her bio says: "Lifelong advocate for children and better schools." 
America, she is playing us like we are too stupid to see what she is!
Queen of Pay To Play #sad #trumprussia #devosrussia
Because that's where the dark skinned people are....
Poor children don't deserve a education. Forget the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic, they will barely get that. Miss Betsy proud.
I hope all of the $9.2 B is made from gender studies and feminism
more $ isn't what's needed
better teachers / no teachers unions is what's needed
America is Stuck on Stupid.!
Schools are usually neighborhood attendance based,  which means some schools have more kiddos from low income households
You are partly accurate, the title monies, however,  are federal and that is where the issue is.  MOST ornery funding for ed is from state
my district,  which is main - street -America,  we get abt 20% of our $ from Fed, & w/o it we would not have our reading intervention prog.
It's frightening that our fate is in the hands of a Feckless democratic party
#Trumprussia #ImpeachTrump now
Good! She knows best!!
Thank you for standing up  @PattyMurray
no cuts Patty
R you surprised by #GrizzlyBetsy? I 4 one am not.
Great now give that money to Goldman Sachs and other billionaires
That's just evil
We have to save $$$ somewhere! We are $21 trillion in debt! #education #spending #economy
This is for tax cuts for 1%
Tax those mother f*ckers
Even if you tax the all of the rich...it won't solve all of our problems!
The GOP wants people uneducated and pregnant so they can point their fingers and exploit the 'white burden' lie. Do better for our kids, USA
How do Democrats explain this? 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/obama-administration-spent-billions-to-fix-failing-schools-and-it-didnt-work/2017/01/19/6d24ac1a-de6d-11e6-ad42-f3375f271c9c_story.html …  You spent billions with no improvement what so ever .

Then take steps to her removed. Don't just do nothing. She is dangerous to education
That's nothing but job security for the Republican Party.
Wait isn't education a state responsibility?  What Constiution have you read?
MURRAY, LOOK AT WHAT YOU, CANTWELL AND INSLEE HAVE DONE TO WASHINGTON STATE OVER THE YEARS! MY GOD, WOMAN, LOOK IN THE MIRROR!
Why??
Not if you don't let her....time to stand up and be counted or be replaced!
We want school choice! Let people be able to afford homeschool cooperatives! They are the future of education!
Still waiting to see how public schools can be banned from political indoctrination of minors
No more liberal indoctrination in public school.
I wonder if there will be any negative effects for the rich when there are millions of poorly educated pple without jobs roaming the streets
hello? can you say, homegrown extremists a la Jeremy Christian in Portland?
#wethepeople know that you don't work 4people #fakeAmerican #Fakerepresenative you don't represent citizens you are FAKE
America has never needed God more than now - We are on a train ride to hell and the devil is happy and awaiting our arrival with open arms!
Glad Patty Murphy is trying to show how awful this would be. No Reason but wealthy tax cut! How could you Betsy!
Watched your opening salvo - ask the tough questions and make @BetsyDeVos answer how she could make such terrible cuts.
My children attended private school but I never have and would never turn my back on the children that need a strong public school system!
@SenateDems @BetsyDeVosED she's a shill for fundamentalist Christian, anti science, anti learning special interests
I hope someone asks her why the smile on her face when she lies to American families
Shame on @BetsyDeVosED
#TDS #HYPOCRITES #LM
Wow!  Senator Murray is on fire!
You go girl!!!  Way to attack! Love you @PattyMurray
