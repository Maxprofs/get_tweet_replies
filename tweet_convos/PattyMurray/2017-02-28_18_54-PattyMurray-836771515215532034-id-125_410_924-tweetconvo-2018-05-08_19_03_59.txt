@SenateDems  ppl forget that ACA was based on Republican plan, or that R's sabotaged the part to make it affordable
where did you come up with that? Not one Republican voted for it?
Why don't the DNC push for single-payer over the corporate give away ACA?
how exactly is the ACA to stay afloat when the major carriers are withdrawing?  VA shows how well govt ins is working, shambles
very few choices in WA, no more than 4, pretty much same cost, no competition
Saw how you wanted to work with him & Republicans last night, Sad but  ery telling
@SenateDems I think that's why they pumped the brakes and zero has been presented. Spin Dr.
when you do some research
dead weight. WA state needs new Senate representation. #notmysenator
you and your cronies made a mess of healthcare. Your legacy!! Pompous attitude!
Or better yet, make Medicare a shining example of healthcare and provide it for ALL.
OBAMA CARE WAS A FAILURE FROM ITS CONCEPTION!
it's falling apart nobody can pay 1200 month premium with 11 thousand deductible.are u that stupid ?
dem party has already made it clear they don't want to 'work together' w @POTUS. #emptywords
you're exempt though, right?
@TBeaucoupe Proclaiming "Repeal &Replace" in speech isn't a good sign? His & GOP's egos are driving them...will hurt Americans
@SenateDems take a deep breath and let oxygen in. Your head may clear one day. Then maybe not!
Why? You rushed to force it down our throats before you even knew what it would do to Americans,
remember Palosi saying we would have to pass it to know what's in it
when will you people u understand its not affordable. It cost too much to have it. Cost too much not to have it.
or dare I say "white privledge"?
Delusional at its best. Not going to dismantle, going to REPEAL ACA.
agreed you should start working. Stop with the oppositional defiance behavior
yeah it helps us keep sick and you have to sue to get a hip replaced. Works great for minor stuff. Keeps u cozzy as u die
Thx for having our back. What struck me is he said, "Have access to.."  Not the same as "Have.." Doublespeak
It's called the AFFORDABLE care act. Where is affordability on your checklist!!!???
You do not listen to the people do you? You can work together.
You tell 'em Patty!  Keep 'em all honest!
lier
thank you for fighting for us!
@SenateDems   I AGREE!!
Can't trust a dem.
@SenateDems It's collapsing in case you're not aware due to the dems. Oh that's right, you get special healthcare for life.
@SenateDems It doesn't work, even Pres Clinton said it was terrible. My health care cost almost 1/5 of my pay! Keeps going up!
Yes! FIX problems, WORK together, DON'T repeal a plan that saves American lives.
@SenateDeMS  Exp.Medicaid-no you caused 1,000,000 ppl in FL & more in Texas & other states to lose the ONLY med ins they had
NOW they don't make enough to buy ACA ins. and they make too much for Medicaid!!  You F****D 100s of thousands! 
@SenateDems so your party created a bomb and now you need help.
@SenateDems stop being an obstructionist and make America great again!! Trump train is full steam ahead 4 every1
@SenateDems You mean the opposite of how you pasted it? #TrumpWonYouLostBig #SuckItUpButtercup #RepealReplaceNow
Aca was a fast track, meant to fail, path to single payer. It was never meant to actually work.
You haven't been listening to the employers in your state rant about how O'bama care is destroying their businesses
@SenateDems Have u Dems gone to the republicans and said let's work together? I don't think so, cause all u do is whine & cry
@SenateDems anyone thinking of improving a system,needs to study the current situation find out how to improve it- but not rush
@SenateDems $740/mo repeal & replace now
@SenateDems er...but did you forget the part where Americans want it dismantled...uh that's one reason we voted for him
They still want to politicize it for browny points .... it's not about votes it about life or death.
No thanks.   The ACA sucks and is a waste of money. If your employer pays you should be taxed.  Simple.
@SenateDems Work together? That display tonight was repugnant. And U want to work together. You are the party of obstruction !
@SenateDems Repeal repeal Obama care
@SenateDems He doesn't have a plan that's why he's asking for Democrats help.
. He told you ppl to work with him! You refuse! Your garbage! Go legislate n stop protesting! #HatefulDems
@SenateDems as 4 ACA it is only 4 a certain kind of ppl. It has not helped my family mmbrs. They have none now thnx to O
a a pgs 2006-09 "forgot" non fed tribes Sebelius directive non fed must "prove Indian enough" violates title6 CRact
hopefully @POTUS will get @CivilRights to prosecute you for this felony against American Indians
He asked that during his speech.
@SenateDems acknowledgement that it isn't working - good job
Hahaha, BYE BYE #Obamacare, good riddance #individualMandate.
.@PattyMurray @SenateDems
@SenateDems u all don't want to wrk w/ anyone that's not ur robot. U all r for urselves & destruction of we the ppl & America
or push for universal single payer health care
@SenateDems he doesn't care about the average person. He doesn't understand health care. Investigate #russiagate now!
@SenateDems 
You won't even acknowledge Obamacare is crumbling over its own weight.

Poorly planned, written and rushed
@SenateDems so he shouldn't get rid of law that is neither quality nor affordable?
@SenateDems Potvcalling the kettle black! We SAW you have no plan to work together. Dems finished!
so 66%  people want to keep ACA why do they want to dismantle? Take Obama name off of it. Name it Trumpcare.
@SenateDems I can't afford it.
#LoveMyACA #Loathe45 #TwitlerIsAnIdiot
@SenateDems no thanks Patty, don't need your help.
You can repair the issues in the ACA to make it work better & more economically. Don't trash it.
like the dems worked with the republicans on aca. Naahhh just stay away
Your stupid ACA Aka stupid obamacare raised my rates through the roof. Healthcare needs a RESET!!!
Where in the Constitution does it give authority to force a person to buy something? It doesn't!!!!!!
.@PattyMurray Nope, it needs to be repealed.
you thieves have had 8 years and lied to Americans every step of the way.
Excuse me? Obamacare is a sinking ship with a 100 holes in it. There's no saving that dead horse.
lol, are you tweeting during the speech?
If Democrats wanted the same, they wouldn't have rushed to pass ACA.  Terrible "aye" vote.
Pre-existing conditions access to care does not = affordable. Fighting w/out of state ins co? Only insurance wins w/#Trumpcare
perhaps you missed that tax credit part...... sounds like #ObamaCare to me.
are you seriously on twitter while the president is speaking?!  Wow. You lady have no respect.  On to the next!!!
why dont YOU get covered by an ACA plan then?  Why did the House AND Senate opt themselves out of the law 8 yeard ago??
You are an embarrassment to our country. Shame on you!!!!!!!
REPEAL AND REPLACE ACA!  I can't afford to pay for everyone!
We Americans have higher standards then you when it comes to Healthcare. #dykehairmurray
you flat out refuse to go against anything that Obama put in motion.
aca is a failure and it cost the dNC THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND IS BANKRUPTING THE POOR AND MIDDDLE CLASS U R A FOOL MURRAY
check The ACA ties the hands of the doctors, increases rates, government stipulated healthcare care. It must be repealed.
Thank you. Improvement is always welcome!
8 years nothing has happen but increase spending.Give him a chance
the Democrats rushed to cram through Obamacare and it failed.  NOW you want to work "together"! No thanks.  #RepealAndReplace
You do not appreciate how much this hurts the people who can not afford the insurance in the first place.
Unaffordable care is a failure
Be prepared to get on with your life's work!
Thank you Patty Murray for being my Senstor and for your service to America & the great state of Washington
I was almost fired over Ocare, when I worked for Big Pharma...was a hoax and still is a costly hoax
no one can afford ACA. That's the problem. My brothers coverage tripled in price, now he can't afford it or doctors appts
work with this creep on NOTHING. RESIST. We will regret every inch we grant to him.
Insurance companies will do the work of dismantling ACA if we do nothing
work with this make it happen!
you want to throw more good money at a bad program.
my insurance coverage when down at work because of the ACA
mine went up
start working with the president to help keep what works and remove what isn't.
My premiums are sky rocketing...enough is enough
Obama junk needs to go.  I know u dont care cause u dont pay for it
#Jointsession Our premiums up 120%. you want to fix healthcare? create full time jobs and employ ppl.
you are insane if you think Obamacare cuts costs. Try going to an exchange and put down the Joint ..
Sure lets ignore all of the negatives and only speak about the positives great way to gain support
http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/11/01/Here-s-How-Much-Obamacare-Premiums-Are-Rising-All-50-States …
He doesn’t. Waste of time. Keep up the fight Patty!
Obamacare saved my family save a of money and made sure we had care.Trump promises nothing,nor does he care.
hey Senator maybe u should get off the Internet and listen you might learn something
He's rushing it no faster than Obama force fed us a lie. He's trying to help everyone, Not just a small few
Rush, please rush!
I lost my vision insurance and others in my company lost their spouse coverage due to the #ACA. We need better!
Ruined my coverage, glad it works for you, though.
