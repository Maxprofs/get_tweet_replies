The Republican plan to unravel the guaranteed benefit of #Medicare would leave seniors vulnerable when they can least afford it.
All that will do is make America sick again, and it shouldn’t have to be said, but that’s the wrong direction for families & economy.
Republicans need to stop putting politics ahead of families’ health care & join us on efforts to make our health care system work better.
No Patty, "politicians" must put taxpayer 1ST.  U have been around long enough to admit that congress screwed citizens with MMA
a lot of people have empty bank accounts due to ACA. Why not supply American people the same insurance you have.
You know Patty, along with ACA this could have helped... http://www.progressiveways.com/2017/01/15/where-were-our-senators/ …
please stop with snarky tweets about Pres Elect Trump.  Won't help yr next campaign
Who told you there would be nothing to replace ACA? And why did you believe them.  They LIE.
Dems are so stupid they don't realize Conservatives will put in place a plan that works.Period!
I have a question for you Senator. What Article 1, Section 8 provision allows Congress to make laws about social healthcare?
I'll wait here patiently until you respond.....
you'll be waiting a while
I figured a legitimate Senator, whose job it is to kno the Constitution, could answer that ? for me fairly quickly
you would think so,but Patty doesn't answer people she's supposed to be representing
obamacare is a failure
most important is protecting Social Security& medicare w/NO Cuts It's our money NOT entitlement. We voted U! Keep fighting!
@SenSchumer 
Barry & Hillary gone = fresh Air.
World relations = opening well.
Barry Care is?
See Gov & support do now?
.@PattyMurray please stay strong! Don’t let them #MakeAmericaSickAgain
Republicans have made empty promises about how ripping apart the health care system, with no plan to replace it, somehow won’t hurt anyone. 
You need to help them. It is your job. Obamacare is a disaster. I tried it. Help us by helping them to fix it!
And Dems promised we could keep our Drs. & our health plan. Fool us once Senator...
, thanks for standing up for our health care and the #ACA. My family and I are glad to have you representing us in Washington.
The Republicans are perhaps the most galactically ignorant, or just plain stupid to think that what they are about to do will
@SenSchumer democrats have been "fixing" the same problems for 50 yrs...sure you want to talk about empty promises?
@SenSchumer Lies !Their just getting started to improve affordable healthcare.
I heard speaker Ryan spouting lies about "millions of Americans being burdened" by ACA...keep fighting for us Senator Murray!!!
We are burdened with unaffordable health care under Obamacare!
No  bleed. Ins up 5%, $1k deuctible, met ded., kidney stone, ER I pay $400, surgery, $700 after ins.
Understand. What if u didn't have any insurance. What then?
@Karma_420Bflo What a disgrace for our Country! This party has the intellect of a first grader!
fake news!
I saw you at the news conference. Thank you
What a horrible slogan....now I know the meaning of political hack.
let them destroy the country its what they will be blamed for doing ( to hell GOP)
it's time for #SinglePayer #Medicare4All
Saw @SpeakerRyan say repeal provides relief. No, repeal takes us back to insurance dark ages  Repeal w/o replace helps no one
Thank you, we are really counting on people with your strength and integrity to stop the Republicans dismantling health care.
YOU GUYS DIDN'T EVEN READ THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BEFORE VOTING ON IT...WON'T LET ANYONE FORGET THAT
@SenSchumer Like HOPE and Change? Shame on Ur stupidity @thehill @AP @cbs @CNN @MiceeMouse @LindaSuhler @FoxNews @TheDemocrats
@SenSchumer dear mrs Murray. Our healthcare system before Obamacare wasn't the best but better than the disaster it is now
You mean DC? DC's promises only mean $$$ from my back to their pocket. Makes me sad that I believe anyone in government.
since u aren't a rep u have no clue what the plan is. How about u "pass the bill & see" as it was once so famously stated 4 ACA
You LIBS put together.A intentionally doomed Health Care law. Counting on A SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM 2 save it.Not A GOP SWEEP.OOPS!
Rand Paul made a pretty good case for a single payer system today on Morning Joe, maybe we should do that
Lying kinda like when President Oliar said, if you like your health plan and Dr you can keep it,smh..
Not true, ACA is all the Dems doing and they fouled up -nothing can help this debacle
#RetainAffordableHealthCare
@washdems #RESIST
Keep in up senator. You've lost over 1,000 seats since Obama took office. Likely to lose another 1,000 at this rate. Great job!
Do not compromise on healthcare. The people complaing need to blame the Republicans. This plan now is BECAUSE of compromise.
@SenateDems Ever since ACA was passed and we could read it, everyone knew it had problems. Why no effort by you to fix it?
Thank you Senator!  Please let me know how I can support you.
They'll get around it by announcing the new plan will be implemented in 2018-19-20, assuming that it will have been forgotten.
obamacare is a dead horse...a failure.
@SenSchumer Really? Your fellow Dems.are claiming Rep. plan will make Americans sick! You guys better get your LIES straight!
How is the ACA with and avarage $12,000 deductible for bronze plans affordable? You democrats lied to get it passed.
@SenSchumer Then pass the law making you pay for your own coverage under ACA
The GOP has no plan for health care because they want Americans unhealthy, unemployed, and uneducated.
After reading the putrumpists on this thread, they got their wish. Ignorant, lazy, prejudiced + conspiracy driven.
its scary to think they will repeal something that so many rely on.
Well done (not)  @carinahaley
.@PattyMurray your plan hurt millions, lost dr, incr premiums, you gave weak coverage and forced purchase, then penalized those who said no
She makes me sick.
agreed
Just stop it!  You're showing your ass to the entire country.
More Repugnican lies!
@lavndrblue I can't wait to see the midterm commercials showing  bereaved families who lost loved ones because ACA was gutted.
You dems really do not get it. AHCA + $20T debt + less dignity = doomed state. You govern like snake oil salesman.
Then why aren't our politicians under the same plan? Why isn't Congress under ACA?????
4 ppl's sake get  drug pushers out of boob tube & all BUSINESS totally out of r health care Wht's w this USA?
But RYANCARE will be so much better.  Ask Ryan
Stay after them Patty!
it will hurt me, my wife, my children and my grandchildren.
Thank you for standing up to the GOP! My brother has congestive heart failure and will die if he doesn't have his medication!
#ACA is a hot mess of ballooning costs & reduced access to preferred care. Time to #repealobamacare & replace w/mrkt solutions.
had great insurance 48yrs before #Obamacare  now  horrible care & my #premiums are more than my #mortgage with a 6k deductible
healthy people = health care savings seems like something even the GOP should understand. Access to preventive care for all!
@SenSchumer Obamacare is a lie and a false sense of security, and is taking away the American people savings accounts
@SenSchumer Obamacare financially crippled me, but other people get free insurance for the rest of their lives is that fair
make it were affordable stay healthy..gym membership for young n old to keep medical cost down by being more healthy it works
he is not even been sworn in yet ! How fast do you want the pres. Elec to go? Obama been in 8 yrs. Has done nothing to help
Drain the swamp! ...starting with YOU!
#LewisCarroll Alice in Wonderland will need to be required reading for the next four years
TY, @PattyMurray, for fighting to #ProtectOurCare: What GOP plan to repeal w/delay of Obamacare will do http://on.mktw.net/2iXx21y  #ACA
ur lying to the ppl. Word has it there are 6 plans for replacement. #irresponsible
@SenSchumer - "empty promises"?  Like, "If you like your plan, you can keep your plan"?
fake news alert
@SenSchumer YOU DONT LISTEN.
Haven't you noticed? #ACA already #Failing . Why not work w/@SenateGOP on replacement?
Some people care about burdening our unborn grandchildren with more debt. Clearly these geriatric Democrats don't.

@PattyMurray @washdems
When was America Sick? Asking for Americans everywhere @PattyMurray
@americonsumer That's a red herring. They have committed to having a replacement in place before Obamacare effectively stops.
Oh?! What it is it? If it's not #SinglePayer / #Medicare4All it'll prob just be another giveaway to Ins. companies?
by the way,you really look pitiful and stupid shown sitting behind Schumer when he speaks his gibberish as leader
WHY IS CONGRESS EXEMPT FROM OBAMA CARE if it is so great for the rest of us???   HYPOCRITES!!!!!
What is the Dem plan t fix the problems w OCare? It's the Dems who can't even conceptualise t problems s offer only a slogan!
Obamacare is a disaster.  Repeal and replace it NOW.
@SenSchumer demand to know when RyanCare and TrumpCare will be unveiled
Like 116% premium increases don't hurt. You lied. You failed. Your party is thoroughly rejected. Learn from it.
Ma'am, Ur my Senator but ur incorrect on this. Republicans have been trying to present plans since beginning. I want real fix.
@SenSchumer OK now tell the truth about what we want. I am ashamed to have you as my congresswoman #TermLimits
@SenSanders ACA covered my family for 1 yr when our jobs were temporarily reduced. No ACA will hurt us & #MakeAmericaSickAgain
@SenSchumer They don't care!
@senschumer Lord have mercy.
I pray the term limit legislation gets pushed through & you have to find another job. #draintheswamp
Does that include u?
Can't be much worse for me since Obamacare was shoved down our throats....
Stand up for healthcare!  Thanks Senator!
@SenSchumer how do u know they are empty promises?  Ur scare tactics won't work anymore. This is why you lost.
Fool
I agree. Senators Murray and Schumer are quite foolish and out of touch.
ASSume what you will.
ooh that was biting. Haha.
@SenSchumer #MakeAmericaSickAgain
All of you in Congress are EXEMPT from the law so you have no idea what it's like to be FORCED to pay for crap insurance.
I pay for insurance, but Hey let everything go shit and people die.. MEDICARE, social security, VA, MEDICAID, AVA,
sigh* :-(
@SenSchumer Dems are the only ones I hear shouting that Reps have no plan for replacement. Typical left lies
Where is their plan, what is in it? We have been hearing this for 6 yrs that they will have a plan. ??
They're not planning to unplug it and stand back. Good parts stay, bad go. New HSAs & more
Sure hope so. Otherwise it is #MakeAmericaSickAgain
#ACA #Obamacare built on LIES n #FAKENEWS from @PattyMurray #Obama #nancypelosi #harryreid #chuckschumer #Democrats

i would def call you a liar. i don't believe your statement at all. take it how u want.
Take it however u want. 
I'm sorry. are you correcting my twenglish?!?!? :-)

25% of American people support repeal and replace. Overwhelming majority want to fix ACA
Agree, I support!!!!!! Many parents happy to keep kids on insurance til age 26.
