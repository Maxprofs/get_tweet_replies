the more desperate a democratic woman hates the more she should have a seat... #retirealready
actually PATTY if the bill fails the DEMs OWN the failing ACA 4 ever! And U can't fix it! DUMB move by Pelosi!
I guess extreme conservatives are good for something after all. #republicrooks
@lyyved and they're happy to do it, they don't give a damn about those who elected them.
This just gets worse and common sense is in the Azores because it's not here.
@OrangeOvrlord @Rewire_News Republicans motive soley based on the fact that they hate Obama not Obamacare.
It's time for you to work with our elected @POTUS.
What does the rewrite look like? How much more damage have they tried to do to women, children & seniors?
I'm starting to wonder, is the entire GOP just men who hate their mothers now? Why ax maternity care otherwise?
@SenateDems @Rewire_News Pathetic! Men determining what HC women can have. Difference between them & Islamic clerics is?
Resist!
Says 1 of the idiots that forced thru "Obama Care" Seriously?
@SenateDems @Rewire_News #votethemout
@POTUS It's a gov't for the people & by the people. House & Senate have to listen to constituents or they will lose job
if you actually had to use Obamacare, you wouldn't think it is so great.
Thank you for fighting for us in WA! No way to #PayMoreForLess #Trumpcare.
Please stay strong.  We need coverage for pre-existing conditions.  We need health care for women.  Thank you!!!!
Senator, Thanks for looking out for your constituants...keep it up!

This is outrageous: Not a single woman in the room as @Mike_Pence and @HouseGOP propose removing maternity coverage in #Trumpcare. 
Until everyone agrees on single payer or "Medicare 4 all" nothing but nothing will be affordable or give all ppl full coverage.
@SenateDems @Rewire_News shame on all of you you all should be fired for the lousy job you're doing
Maybe Democrats should support the Ryan Plan or risk a more conservative bill. Maybe Democrats are irrelevant!!
@amanda_green atlas failed
ACA is broken, either fix it or replace it...either way...this doesn't make you look good...you were the ones shoving ACA...
@SenateDems not just maternity care but hospitalization & outpatient care.
That's it.  No more sex for Republicans.  Not until maternity care is back on the health care plan.
vote no to RumpCare.
if this passes it's like the election all over again - Rigged!  American people again screwed.
@SenateDems it's going to be so ridiculously bad, and they will stick their noses in the air and claim they restored freedom
Curious who their voting base will be once they ruin the lives of so many people
@SenateDems at this point Is it just better/cheaper to fully fund Obamacare?  1%ers buy on less yacht each, we all get well
@SenateDems This isn't healthcare. Just a savage campaign promise.
@SenateDems @Rewire_News There will be NOTHING left when they get done and that's what they want!
@SenateDems  Paul Ryan...zero respect.
Yes, the longer this goes, the less socialist it becomes.
@SenateDems @Rewire_News Just say NO
This is what happens when you give monkeys crayons...a failing healthcare bill
@SenateDems well, when they start rounding up the Handmaidens they will get maternity coverage, right? No problem then.
no abortion, but no maternity care either. Makes total sense <to people who hate women>.
The worst already exists! We need to step away from government influences that dictate our needs in healthcare insurance!
@SenateDems @Rewire_News Trumpcare is Dumpcare. Fight for us Senator Murray!!!  # counting on you
@HouseGOP  @HouseDemocrats 
At this point, why don't Republicans just say we'll pay through the nose for no coverage at all?
@SenateDems truth is, Dems are more concerned w solidarity than whether the final product works or not. #whywerehere
60-year-old with $20,000 income would get $4,000 (70% less than under ACA)
huh?
@SenateDems it's not a health plan. It's a wealthy tax credit. One can't replace insurance with anything else. #notmypresident
U couldn't be more correct sir. It's millionaire & billionaire welfare
we made a mistake. We don't need all mistakes to happen. #trumpcare is a mistake.
We need a true free market or single payer.  Current insurance company stranglehold is literally killing
@SenateDems @Rewire_News @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan  Ryan care nothing about  america #bimbo #laughingstock
@SenateDems #Trumpcare #Ryancare will be the Failed Legacy of @HouseGOP @SenateGOP. Base @GOP Voters need #ACA
56 percent of people don't the health care bill
Paul Ryan needs to be sacrificed to save maternity care.  Women need insurance that provides birth control and abortion, too.
pretty extreme calling for someone to be killed because you disagree about economic policy
You spelled "better" wrong. How are you a U.S. Senator again?
how's it better? Honest Q
After the last 8 years of Obamacare and my insurance going from 297 to 900 a month I'm desperate too #TERMLIMTES

If #TrumpCare is DOA, it'll be good thing ... cuz Trump's #AmendedSoItWillPass #AHCA doesn't cover RESUSCITATION !
#ACA...#FixItDontNixIt 
it can't be fixed
If the GOP bill fails, it's because the GOP has a wider spectrum of "awful" than anybody really knows.
"Extreme" House conservatives? Really Senator? How counter-productive from a sitting US Senator. Expect better #WontGetIt
Worse? They don't care about women, the poor or the elderly. Yet they think the bill will pass and they will have jobs in 11/18
The mothers, daughters & wives of congressional GOP should go to Capital Hill & slap these men across the face!
By tonight: "Ppl making < $20,000 year give 50% of salary to nearest billionaire in exchange for $5 off Airborne chewables."

@PattyMurray
too funny 
GOP Congress melted down like Fukishima before it melted down.
