It is so pathetic that the Dems have still not approved my full Cabinet.
Great job vetting this one! Good thing she's out.
oh, but it was okay that the Republicans never approved Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court?
The American voters will hold you responsible for blocking Pres Trump. We will vote you out!
Pres Trump is doing the job we asked him to do while your sorry buts are too busy with your own greedy agendas .
actually @realDonaldTrump it is you who is pathetic. NO US President would EVER speak/tweet like that. You are #UnfitForTheJob
just like muslim immigrants you dont vet them at all. Oh wait its because you love them more than any American
Thank you! Many of them need to go to the vet and be dewormed.
snots
@realDonaldTrump For very good reasons. The ones that have passed shouldn't have been.
@Judemedicis did you just see that ?! #hbic #idontcareiloveit hahahaha
Where was this sass all last month?
Clones! None of them have certificates. Wash., home of the clowns.
Thanks for doing your job to protect this country from dictators
@realDonaldTrump Like Mattis, Sessions, Devos, Tillerman, Pruitt and all the others that I haven't named but need to go
@kodibear7 And yet they've approved people who clearly are against the agencies they've been appointed to. Good job Democrats 
Absolutely!
@NickMerrill you are still throwing fits because you didn't win or get your way... so continue to look like an A$$
so very true
why don't you just listen in with their Samsung tv
and they won't unless someone light a fire under their ass
Thank you for working so hard for ALL AMERICANS!  We need you, now more than ever!
dems are against the country. Y'all lost. Can we all accept that fact and move forward w/o all the histrionics?
agreed. But stop with the stonewalling already.
you call it stonewalling, I call it doing the job they were hired to do.
to be. Maybe if the left would give him 1/2 a chance they might be surprised what can be done when
I keep looking for cause for hope from him. Only immaturity and irrationality.
look harder.
@grannynannynews @realDonaldTrump stellar picks so far. Flynn, Sessions, Carson, DeVos. You only hire the best people.
you need 2 bet your party, cheating and lying seem to be a prerequisite
@grannynannynews I still cannot put the words "president" & "Trump" in the same sentence.
NOT my President/nvr will b. He lost the popular election.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS You need to accept the fact that you will not be president for long much less be voted in a second time
Some will buy into his skewed comments. ("No real concerns here, just politics.Yeah, that's the ticket.")
@realDonaldTrump Donald, just puit trying to hire butt heads. The problem is YOUR CHOICES, not the democrats.
How well did Obama vet Daniel, Richardson and Gregg?
thank you!! Stay strong...RESIST.  It's Karma Time!
It's almost as if this "extreme vetting" thing was just some crap he blurted out on the campaign trail, with no actual substance
it's Almost like DHS n FBI admitted to congress that we have no way of vetting Syrians and that....
@realDonaldTrump if the cabinet wasn't full of rejects from the three stooges it might go faster!
get your head out and quit being obstructive! Hillary, Obama, Reid gone!
It's called Democracy, ever heard of that? Not biz, democracy. 2 totally different things & ways of working. @realDonaldTrump
@Leticia17922167 Because your taste of candidates are sub standard.
thank you!
Being the mess that exist in your cabinet none need to be approved!
except @marcorubio said all nominations acted on, @potus needs to finish his noms instead of tweeting. #potus do ur job. #resist
YOUR PATHETIC POTUS !!! YOUR NOT WORTHY OF BEING CALLED OUR NATIONS PRESIDENT !! YOU HAVE NO INTEGRITY !! ZERO CREDIBILITY!!
This is the type of shade/aggressive response/resistance that will rebuild Dem party reputation. Bravo.
and he only chose a handful out of 100 posts.
he's it a lot more than cabinet members. Almost 1000 feds
@susandtom. Extreme vetting!  If it takes that standard to enter the country why not to enter the gov't?
Clearly so!
Stand strong, we need you now more than ever! #resist #winteriscoming #TaxReturns #Trumprussia
your cabinet is full of racists and bigots just like you! All they care about is getting money and more money like you!
You didn't just burn him you torched his you- know-what  I like it 
yeah y'all say that but we have Betsy over here so
Day-um!!!

Said the people who wanted to elect the woman who exposed nat sec to get around FOIA. @SenateDems @OzForBernie
And some are liars.
What's truly pathetic: That *this* sorry excuse for a human being followed President Obama. Please work on removing him.
You are really overplaying your hand.
it would also help if @realDonaldTrump actually had nominees for the 500+ positions still open. @SenateDems are doing their job
Democrats they are pathetic
The Dems are not going to arbitrarily approve any of your candidates for your administration.
Well, then, how in the hell did you let Wilbur Ross get through, not to mention Tillerson and Sessions? #resist @PWCDems
STAY STRONG Democratic leaders !!!
As crazy as that seems. Vetting does not = billionaire.
Does it have to be pointed out that there are Dems in the Senate who have voted to approve some of these horrible nominees?
How, then, did Wilbur Ross, Tom Price, Steve Mnuchin, Jeff Sessions, Betsy DuVos get approved? Serious ethics issues with all.
I agree with your statement but @realDonaldTrump doesn't deserve the title Mr let alone President.
democrates are the new communist party against American people,  russians became more reliable than  democrates
His admin did not vet them. And the country did not vet Him! He needs EXTREME VETTING now! #RESIST #TrumpTaxes #TrumpRussia
@Rekeiji - That's right let that FOOL know you all were doing your job, in spite of him!
... Listen up you Demorats WELL the people are sick of your nonsense it's gotten old fast , let the @POTUS do his job!
Thank you for doing your jobs!!
did not or could not?
Burn!
don't Dems his cabinet is so bad
He's pathetic
bunch of arrogant, reactionary ideologue three-dollar bills. #nationaldisgrace
@Alt_DeptofED @realDonaldTrump isn't he leaving hundreds of seats unfilled?
@SenateReps   Victim/mizerGame Continues Distractions GaloreMillionsChildrenMising&PossHeld CaptiveByTrafickersFreingThemMaters
@CJTheArchitect and the 517 that haven't been nominated?
@realDonaldTrump maybe submitting paperwork would help?
Such a unifying message from @POTUS. NOT! Sad and pathetic man.
yes! If we get people coming to our country. People going to WH certainly must also be vetted!!
Boom.
YOU don't have to do anything, because YOUR party has become politically irrelevant.
It's at the point where I would start picking folks out of a phone book at random and asking if they want the job!
get ballsy chuck!
@USofDisaster Still waiting for Head of FEMA and 10 Regional Directors appointments #CantBlameDemsOnThis
love it!
@BachToTheFuture shots fired
@Alt_DeptofED @realDonaldTrump The GOP's not big on vetting. Hence Trump.
@Alt_DeptofED yall failed on DeVos and Sessions
pathetic losing muppets these stupid Dems are @Damocleansword
@Alt_DeptofED aren't republicans in control of Like when votes happen and stuff? And trump hasn't nominated for hundreds of jobs
and in addition, he hasn't nominated for many of the positions open...not that he understands that fact....
the swamp is so true

@modrtmike They're trying but your cabinet keeps lying! #RESISTANCE #SessionsLied #PenceLied #TRUMPLIED
" Have you noticed that they don't want to work for you! Your just not getting it are you?
@realDonaldTrump They were vet'd by Putin so, you know....
Be prepared to get primaried!
childish crap, obummers cabinet had worse people and repubs let them slide. Wtf??
.@SenateDems
You can only let so many Crooks in the government at a time ... you have far exceeded the Limit!
clearly Mr. Trump this is not your company this is the United States. They represent the good people who want honest public
servants. Who care about their country
all that's #pathetic is spineless #Republicans putting #GOP before #USA #SAD
@ChristieSzRelax With extreme vetting! Extreme, as your little mind so requested.
& @realDonaldTrump we-the MAJORITY who didn't vote for you-are in favor of extreme vetting of your ghastly picks
@Eykis Probably a good idea not to approve anymore.
ALL those presented have still been approved anyway so, including Sessions so much for "vetting."
they were all seated before trump tweeted this
OMG
This is a disaster. Could you please get ON with the illegitimacy of the Admin so we can continue AMERICA
@realDonaldTrump If you nominated respected experts rather than nutjobs, probably take less time. Hint!
And lets hope that every single REPUBLICAN who let these ridiculous choices get in will be SWIFTLY booted to the curb! #NoMore
@nycjayjay Not everyday people should accept everything abt you Mr #Trump you must accept the difference or just give up!
@realDonaldTrump but the dems have no problem letting in immigrants from US hating countries with little vetting

can you answer why your party is so protective of Sex Offenders & Pedophiles? We will get down to bottom of it.
@RonWyden u deliberately slowed them down. U are destroying our country with ur selfish behavior! #time2cleanhouse #work
@burpeesRfun it's so pathetic that your Conservatives had to block everything good the Dems proceeded to bring forth for 8 yrs.
they have proceeded to destroy, women's rights, the LGBT community, animal cruelty and testing rights, EPA etc. Wow
are itching for a bitter fight with ISIS - ass backward clowns! Destroying their country & the planet!
#ExtremeVetting
@spokenELLE
Top tweet.
@JRehling
Boom
yes.  and they are an unqualified, corrupt bunch of the worst kind of scoundrels
@TrashyChic 
And When Do We Get
All The BEST People
@realDonaldTrump Not vet them, persecute them.  Dems on idiot witch hunt paid for by far left and big money, suppressing mid inc
@realDonaldTrump pathetic is uniquely unqualified candidates you are trying to appoint. When are you going to put country first?
Sure hope none of you voted yes on Perry or Carson. Both totally unqualified for those jobs
why be so cordial to this asshole prez?! Clearly a Fascist sympathizer who is drunk on power!
@realDonaldTrump should know by now that money can't buy competence.... #unqualified
(CC: @chelseafought @tomakeanend)
but they got in anyway
Good. Keep up the good work. White House Administration is pathetic.
@Schmart1 Playing politics. Start working for the American people. We are tired of the petty games. #DoYourJob
To be fair it goes for both parties.  We are tired of all the political posturing.  Support the fairly elected CIC.
Yep it's like watching the WWE.
"Guys, it was a little warm in here a few years ago, so I'm going to set the house on fire. Marvel at my intelligence!
@Melissa22461016 Vet or pushed to the side. Not with the preplaned back up orders incase of election loss. High School all over.
How can the Dems APPROVE ANYTHING He PUTs FORWARD?? trumptaduduh is a moron.
What about the 2000 other govt posts - Dems blocking them or POTUS slackening?
Yeah this is what happens when you don't let Citibank and others behind the 2008 collapse pick your cabinet right? 
@realDonaldTrump  who's left? Just replacing the ones with memory issues. We're sure there'll be more.
@realDonaldTrump who gave him back his phone? Maybe they know where theACA is.
@2020fight Just curious..how many were filled by this time under Bush and Obama.  Where's Humpty Trumpty stand in comparison?
the only THING !!!!!! pathetic is you donald j trump.
do you vet them like as Schumer vetted the child molester he helped into the US?
oh they vetted them. They just dont care how bad or unAmerican they are. @ManMet80
Trump & all his picks are all CORRUPT!! Yes, no REAL vetting but GOP pushed through & whined about Democrats!
Or worse, they did vet them but decided the results were satisfactory! To GOP, many of these problems are features, not bugs.
how many socialists in your party did you vet?
You clearly didn't vet your last candidate for president. #criminalclinton #hypocrits
Trump had Russia vet his cabinet. You know, people that own Trump.
nice burn! But it's not nice to pick on the slow kids like @realDonaldTrump
DAYUMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Stand strong for the American people we need someone to help us from the Trump royalty.

Yet many of you @SenateDems voted for these blatantly incompetent people anyway! Explain that, please?
We had to vet them, Mr. President. Your administration clearly did not. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/837638488656920576 …
much better job than YOU did vetting usurper Obama that  has a PROVEN FAKE birth cert. along with ties to radical communists.
Don't approve any, they are all dirty and please look at the Bank of Cyprus and work backwards till you get?
@realDonaldTrump Who do you think you're kidding? Republicans have enough votes to approve all of them. It's not the Dems fault
@Brad_Burgen 
R U that Oblivious APPRENTICE! Who cares bout yur Russian Cabinet! Get Head Out of ASS! U R #1 wit RUSSIA'S PUTIN & LEAKS!
Stop his every weekend vacations! Work is in d.c. not florida!
.@SenateDems @philipsturner this is obstruction not vetting. #shadowgovtattacks
Pathetic excuses by Rs. Tr^mp noms can barely get themselves thru the submission of their ethics paperwork. @notinabluemoon @SenateDems
A few trolls in my feed claim confirmation delays for Tr^mp noms is a sign of @SenateDems obstruction. True story—http://wapo.st/2mCxXdG 
it's fucking great lmfao

@mrswhit9 Thank you Senate Democrats for doing your job!
what a crybaby
@PrincessBravato I could never call this s dirt bag  Mr president !
.@SenateDems @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump  @washingtonpost @nytimes - Trump doesn't know what "vetting" and "due diligence" are #IncompetentPOTUS
@MrJamesonNeat nominate something besides Russian spys and then maybe???
