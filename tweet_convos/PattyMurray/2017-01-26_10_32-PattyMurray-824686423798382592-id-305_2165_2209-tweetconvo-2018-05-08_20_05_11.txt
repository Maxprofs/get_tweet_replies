I trust you'll viot NO on #DeVoss.
Murray is a Clinton centrist, too often votes with Republicans against majority of her constituents.
Typical neolib rhetoric is to sound left, vote right.
Likes to be deal maker with GOP. Just voted against portion of a Bill allowing import of affordable drugs from Canada - so yeah, sometimes.
thank you for your insistence and persistence at the confirmation hearing.
78%of WA voters disagree with your superdelegate vote for Hitlery, why we have a trump presidency.  You're fired!
they want to get kids into indoctrination camps
Sounds like you're twisting the truth, Patty Murray.
You know what to do! Do not vote to confirm. Fight her appointment with everything you have. We are behind you.
I cannot take this seriously as you have just shared a Buzzfeed article on this matter.
Wow.  Every one of his nominees is a nightmare!  Stop this lunatic!

Would you be playing hardball with an Obama nominee?
VOTE NO
She can't be approved! Please think of the children! I'm fighting on behalf of my first grandchild now. He's 4!
DeVos is a great choice to reform our broken education system!
DeVos doesn't even know the education system how on earth is she going to reform it
Yes she does!You been misinformed!
Have you watched her hearing????? She knows nothing.
DeVos has been an advocate for children all her life!DeVos puts children first!
Sure, unless they're disabled, don't feel like getting scammed, or don't want to get shot.
Actually I agree with her position on security!Disability is already addressed!
WOW! WTF? #WhataShame
Object to every consent agreement!!
Please vote against her.
keep on fighting for WHAT'S right.  THANKS!
Today @ the voting hearing for DeVos you brought up that trump won't show his tax return Seriously?
2020 Trump!
Her nom must be defeated
@kjoerwin @BuzzFeedNews Republican Congress on A Conference call with PUTIN. ..Is This What TRUMP Supporters Voted For? ?
Please #OpposeDeVos #OpposeSessions
#FAKENEWS #MSMBOYCOTT
I felt if your love for the GOP is greater than your love for your nation, you don't love US
.@PattyMurray Thank you for speaking out against a DeVos confirmation. She has too little experience & knowledge re: public education.
please vote no on this woman!
you the #preschool teacher in #tennisshoes. I should listen to you?  Nope. You are destroying #WAState
I didn't realize you hated women being in power so much. hmm, interesting
and now she is our education leader #RIPAmerica
How much did teachers unions contribute to Dem campaigns?
are you going to vote no on DeVos?
Thank you Senator Murray for opposing DeVos - she is BAD for education and cannot be Secretary.
She is unfit to be in charge of our children's future.
@bariRD @BuzzFeedNews that's bad when one of your own won't commit to protecting their own
which RepublicanSenators should we call to encourage NO on DeVos????
DeVos is an overly privileged ignorant stepford wife.
@deejay90192 @BuzzFeedNews Please vote NO on DeVos confirmation.
what is wrong with that woman? She's a walking horror story! @deejay90192 @BuzzFeedNews
Democrats won't commit to actually educating the children in our schools.
please vote NO! Stand strong!
Any public servant who won't enforce laws doesn't belong in that job. We R not here 2 uphold her private agenda
Let us know which GOP senators might join you. We'll contact them with our politically unbiased concerns.
Senator, you have odd record on choice.  Why don't you favor "choice" for poor families to leave failing school?
do not confirm.
seems she won't commit to anything. trying to do a side step.judge by actions not words.
you really think federal law is determined by Obamas Dear Colleague letter. You should resign!
vote no on DeVos!
Will you commit to voting no on #DeVos? @SenatorCantwell has listened to her constituents and promised a no vote. #SwampCabinet
Just say no to DeVos.
More pandering pablum for the masses. Thinks she's doing something productive. Imagine if she had a real job.
Unfortunately, DeVos and many other Trump nominees will be rubber stamped through the process.
What the heck. You expect our children to be sexually assaulted? We have a bigger problem, if that is expected
I just heard talk of Stopping funding for Native school funding???? @PattyMurray find out please
@balls_anonymous @BuzzFeedNews of course not she is the dumbest person put into position of power since Sarah Palin
Really???  But you're going to vote for her anyway?
called your office to voice my opposition, appreciate your "no" vote and all your hard work on behalf of humane values.
make sure @SenatorCantwell understands
@SenSchumer @BuzzFeedNews bla bla bla. Keep bloviating fools
VOTE NO ON DEVOS
fight these nazis. They are eviscerating our country.
please do not vote for this unqualified person.
wouldn't want to give women the advantage over grizzly bears
No DeVos...save our public schools.
Vote No!!! If you can vote HELL NO!!!!!
@buffydjtslayer @BuzzFeedNews DeVos is dangerous!! Say NO to DeVos!!

So you're voting "NO" on her nomination, right?
Please be on the right side of history--don't normalize this insanity.
Republican women are traitors to their gender.
.@PattyMurray @BuzzFeedNews Why just women & girls, tho? Boys are abused by teachers/students, too! #DeVosFacts
.@PattyMurray @BuzzFeedNews  NO. Do not allow this undeniably unqualified woman near our children's education policies. #DeVosFacts
please encourage your colleagues to vote no on Devos
no to Devos
please try to convince other senators to also vote NO for DeVos. Thank you for standing up for our children's best interest.
just vote 'no,' ma'am.
lecture the young things of course
When you hope to work a misogynist and rapist, you surly can't support protection of women or girls!!
"DeVos Did Not Say That She Likes Girls, So She Hates Them!"  LOL.  Sure, Patty.  Whatever.
plz continue to oppose the nomination of DeVos!
vote for congressional term limits
@ACLU @BuzzFeedNews bot NO ON DEVOS.
NOT LAW BUT ILLEGAL DCL MANDATE
@BodilLehrmann @BuzzFeedNews Automatically disqualified in my book.
Thank you
donald went out of his way to find the most repulsive of the repugnant.  And we're supposed to respect?
@jilevin @BuzzFeedNews yes she would! Against grizly-bears!!!
since when are you worried about safety  Boy's in girls bathrooms illegal boys you know nothing about.OMG
I have been watching the hearings and am dismayed and deeply troubled. She is not the right person for this job.
This woman is absolutely unqualified--please oppose her actively!
She didn't agree with your interpretation of how the law should be enforced not that she wouldn't enforce it.
https://www.oximity.com/article/My-Response-to-Senator-Lamar-Alexander-1 â€¦ @PattyMurray please ask @SenAlexander to get back to me - no reply to email or tweet?  @BuzzFeedNews
This is shameful of our esteemed senator. How can she support the abdication of due process in our schools?
More worried about shooting a bear than stopping a rapist
- as the mother of a brilliant autistic student who relies heavily on the IDEA - THANK YOU! He deserves better. #noDeVos
So what obonehead wouldn't enforce immigration laws eother. your party set the status quo on that so get over it!
@SenSchumer @BuzzFeedNews Vote no.  This woman is blatantly not what is needed.
Please vote no on her and Sessions.
@BetsyDeVos please go away & do not ruin our education system. You'll be the biggest joke of this administration.
I'm being led to believe your colleague @MariaCantwell is still undecided on this confirmation....
This is School Choice week ALL Over the Country! Get On Board or GET OUT! YOU ARE JUST protecting Union Bosses NOT KIDS! U SUCK
US spends trillions and kids rank 14th out of 40 in the world in education SOMEthing is WRONG... fix it
she is HORRIBLE in a land of HORRIBLE nominees.
DEVOS & PATTI ARE DEVOID TOO.
WHY DID PATTY VOTE WITH BIG PHARMA TO SCREW AMERICANS DRUG COST CONTROLS ??
Remember:more of your constituents are parents than are union members and they vote.
This is reason enough to vote NO on the Devos confirmation.
where was this criticism in the last administration? Sexual harassment only increased!
Anyone related to Erik Prince can't be good at all.
Send her back to the swamp where she came from.
@CcriderJohn @BuzzFeedNews .@SpeakerRyan .@realDonaldTrump
#Liberal #DEMS are #Fascist & USE SCHOOLS to BRAINWASH the kids ... that's why they're so against #BetsyDeVos & #SchoolCHoice
Sure because like Phyllis Schlafly, she honestly believes that a woman's place is pregnant + in the kitchen.
Your voice & vote means nothing if elected officials continue go along to get along. Do your jobs!
want to protect women and girls? Get rid of sanctuary cities #alltalknoaction
None of #45 nominees will commit to anything that is human & decent yet Dems still vote yes on them
Riiight bc she really hates woman and girls...smh...you Democrats can be so dishonest.
@HobhouseFlower @BuzzFeedNews  Don't confirm her! I'm from MI, she's a disaster! Anti-teacher, student, LGBT, union.
How much money have you received from teacher's unions? Conflict of Interest! #DeVossFacts
@freeandclear1 @BuzzFeedNews One might say DeVos should be committed!  That goes for Trump & the rest of his cabinet as well.
#VoteNo

Please oppose DeVos!
Wow - your source is Buzzfeed?  Is that all the Democrats have to offer, politics of destruction?
but Liberals want you to be able to change your gender daily so you can Shower with our Girls?  Right...
#fakenews #alternative facts
@Shelster011 @BuzzFeedNews vote no!
@SenSchumer @BuzzFeedNews VOTE NO. CANNED RESPONSES. NO KNOWLEDGE, NO DEPTH. She looked CLUELESS 
@RiseUpAbove @BuzzFeedNews Don't vote for her. Bears and guns don't mix.

gee are women and girls unprotected now?
@RiseUpAbove @BuzzFeedNews If One Democrat Votes For Betsy Devos or Jeff Sessions We Will UNSEAT You Next Election. ....#ENOUGH
why is "women and girls" so important to you in an education that should includes everyone?  a one sided opinion?
no one has learned yet that buzzfeed isn't news it's propaganda
she actually said "ensuring that the intent of the law is actually carried out " &wants to fix what's broken
@BuzzFeed ??! Are you kidding me? That's like using the National Inquirer as your go to for political news.
You're nothing but a political hack. The largest city in the state u represent REFUSES 2 enforce federal law & you sit silent.
.@PattyMurray

Poor Patty.

Doesn't have a clue. Nobody uses @BuzzFeedNews for news. They'd need 2 sources just to qualify as fake news.
@tylerkingkade clean your teeth
#neverBetsy #stopsessions
@gop Geez, when are they just going to dump her?  She has nothing to offer that is any good at all.
#buzzfeed are #fakenews
disband the DOE-Individual state responsibility IMO.  In any case, she is a shitty pick for the position.
She is the worst and she owes her state a FINE of 5 million.
Title 9 is a disaster
how about boys and men, don't they deserve protection too?
typical @GOP. But they are so worried abt the danger of trans ppl using bathrooms
Utter nonsense #GOPHypocrisy.
DeVos does not have the credentials, education, concerns or desire to be a good Sec of Education. Vote No!
Can we rely on you & @SenCantwell to vote no on confirmation?
Then we expect ALL Democrats in Congress to FULLY OPPOSE her appointment.
So we can count on you to vote against her nomination?
Maybe torture would get the truth from her. She may not care about protecting women https://goo.gl/u5lSGO 
please stop trying to be nice and oppose everything he wants.
DeVos will harm our children. Please oppose her
Implication: she wants girls raped on campus? Pols say the stupidest things. Amazing they get elected. #DeVosFacts
Campus' shouldn't do it. Police should.
@ACLU @BuzzFeedNews extremely disturbing
Thanx for resisting. She's a disaster for democracy, which requires education. Please continue to resist!
don't lie: she is only stating that there will be due process for every accusation... remember Rolling Stone?
Oh, you mean like title9 Kangaroo university courts without due process?
NO, oh no!! Senator Murray, she is not capable for this job. All she is, sadly is rich!!!!
@SenSchumer @BuzzFeedNews BS coming from Dems, Teachers Union more important then education. 7 billion spent 0 improvement
Oh Patty Patty Patty... give it up,
@SenSchumer shameful!
@CraigCo62 @BuzzFeedNews thumbs down all around ppl! Which Repubs should I call???
She's definitely getting confirmed, if we never needed this law and girls were ok before, why do we need it now? BuzzFeed = #fakenews
Please continue opposing DeVos. Her work has caused MI students' literacy + overall test scores to drop.
do not confirm! She would be a disaster for our schools and children!
So you're a big NO, right?
You mean that she won't enforce your tortured "interpretations" of Title IX #DeVosFacts
Senator, you know that girls in our schools have same rights as boys! Sadly your mouth works before your brain!
oh ya and buzz feed is so truthful...
she can't her boss is a sexual predator
No to DeVos!
,Not even from Grizzly bears, Betsy?
The #illegitimatePresident only picks from the bottom of the barrel. Each nom. dumber and unfit
No she didn't you liar.  Some of your question were so stupid.
