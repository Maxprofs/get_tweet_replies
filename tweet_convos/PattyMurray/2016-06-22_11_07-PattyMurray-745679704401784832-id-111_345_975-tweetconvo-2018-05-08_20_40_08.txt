Childish, worn out, 60s style protest makes you look even more idiotic than normal. #NoBillNoBreak
@skookerG @HouseDemocrats Thank you Senator. Proud to be one of your constituents!
Thank you! 90+% of the US is behind you. I am esp proud that you are my Senator (and @RepAdamSmith is my Rep).
THANK YOU!
I support you, Patty! Everyone in Washington State (that I know) supports you, too.
There is already gun laws on the books  funny how politicians are guarded with guns. But not us?
so proud of you Senator.  Don't relent! #Enough #holdthefloor #NoBillNoBreak
#No VoteNo Break #No Fly No Buy Keep up the good fight
Thank you, Senator Murray. Hang in there. Glad to hear your joining the sit-in. Get us some gun control.

Thank you Patty! Well done.@PattyMurray @HouseDemocrats

Did you set up the required 'drum circle' yet?  #NoBillNoBreak foolishness. #2A
why did you not vote for Sen. Cornyn's proposal?
Thank you! Proud in Washington State!
Thank you!
#NoBillNoBreak
Thank you all so much! Glad to have voted for you!
Thank you for standing up, but please consider that terror watch lists/background checks racist/biased. Better bills needed.
thank you!!!
must be nice getting paid to be cry babies when things don't go your way #noworknopay get back to work
#TurnOnTheCameras @GOP @SenateGOP
Thank you!!!
Take guns away from law abiding citizens while being protected by them so you can throw a tantrum.
thank you!!!! #holdthefloor #EndGunViolence
Why dnt u do a sit in 4 all the Syrian Refugees the Deep State & Hillary created? @Mcknife1952 @HouseDemocrats
legislation cannot change a persons heart.  You will NEVER end gun violence.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats How about you all get rid of your security and armed protection, first! #banterrorists #banplanes
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats You guys do realize people are watching you & thinking "I wish they'd be this hard on our enemies".
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats please live tweet...
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats morons there is a bill on the books it's called the Bill of Rights & 2nd Amendment
@kristina_wong @HouseDemocrats 
"Action"?
Why'd Dems block 2 of 4 gun measures this week?

#FixTheWatchList or just politicking
Since our treasonous gov't refuses to end influx of Muslims, American citizens must oppose all gun control!
@SenateDems  thanks for sitting on the rights of Americans Patty, you are doing a great service by stomping the constitution
Thank you Sen Murray. Very proud to have you representing us!
.@PattyMurray & @MariaCantwell Please represent WAVoters and join the sit-in #NoBillNoBreak #guncontrol now. @HouseDemocrats
thanks for representing Washington State!
Thank you!
Thank you, Senator Murray! #holdthefloor #NoBillNoBreak
@KREM2 @HouseDemocrats was flagged at airports for years because of my last name, common name = lose rights
it was also a "Hate Crime" against LGBT. Can we get the "Equality Act" passed while you're at it?
Y'all demorats go sit on the floor and sing kumbaya. No deals will be made on gun control. Ever @PattyMurray @kristina_wong @HouseDemocrats
maybe you should question that list instead of our 2A Stop being Obama's lapdog
Go Senator Murray, make WA State proud.
THANK YOU
Well, this is unusual: Dems stage sit-in on House floor until  they secure a vote on gun control measures
quit trying to circumvent the 2nd and 5th amendment to Constitution!
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats THAT'S WHAT WE WANT YOU TO THINK! >:D #Muahahaha!
 thank you
just want to say how much of my faith has been restored in government today!!! Thank you!!!
Thank you so much.
.@PattyMurray @HouseDemocrats Do any of you have interns handy? Have them teach you @periscopeco, then post a link to your live feeds. Boom.
Thank You!! 
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats didn't you swear a oath to uphold and defend the constitution?  the 5th amendment covers this
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats Go Get'em Patty!!
Grandstanding and #hashtags have never prevented terrorism.  I vote in WA. #DoYourJob or you're out.
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats this is how our govt works now? if you oppose you take over and shut things down? Childish
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats where we're you when guns were sent to Mexico with Fast and Furious?  #noflynobuy #NoBillNoBreak
@SenateDems @HouseDemocrats you're heading to the floor in an attempt to strip me of my 2nd amendment right. You will fail!!!
THANK YOU!!! KEEP IT UP! We are with you! #DisarmHate #holdthefloor
when will you be calling for an end to the PC approach to islamic terror?? or will you continue to be a coward?
thank you for standing up (or I guess in this case sitting down) for common sense gun reform #DisarmHate #holdthefloor
you're not stopping anything Patty you're making it worse
@SenateDems are you actually gonna try to stop violence or support this #NoFlyNoBuy nonsense?
Go go go!
Thank you Senator so much. There needs to be an end to the violence #NoBillNoBreak #holdthefloor
