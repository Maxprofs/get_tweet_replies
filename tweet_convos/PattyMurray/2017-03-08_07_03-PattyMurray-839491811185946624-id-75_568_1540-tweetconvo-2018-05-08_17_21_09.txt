I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.
He's already proven it... @KellyannePolls first women in history to run successful President. No dems praise.
maybe you should take your own advice and support the importation of drugs from Canada. Quit supporting big Pharma...
words are cheap, action is what counts, trump loses on every count
Exactly! He is not only sexist to the extreme, but racist and misogynistic.  #notmypresident
Good job senator Murray! Keep this very reckless person in line!
45 lacks any perspective or sense of reality of how people perceive him in the world...sign of an untreatable narcissist.
@SenateDems I'm a woman, a nurse, and against abortions. Where's the prenatal Care in Planned Parenthood?  No pro life services
.@PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump How about we stop calling it Trumpcare and call it "GOPcare" or "GOP wet dream"
Sadly @realDonaldTrump has only shown respect for women that he can boss around or who have the last name "Trump."
I don't see him submitting equal pay legislation.
Trump would gladly fund PP if no abortions. Understand difficult decisions, but what is a 5 week old fetus with beating heart?
thank you and @SenatorCantwell for your prompt response to this mess of a Healthcare ? Plan! #indivisiblewa1
or Chumpcare
yes, women are so weak their health can only be provided by government 
I love  you Patty! Shout out from Klickitat County!
From someone (you) who advocates pro-choice and late term abortions. Right to life trumps personal choice, with few exceptions.
@SenateDems not trump care, CONservative Care #CONCare
Will you propose universal, single-payer health care? Start the fight now.
@SenateDems Where is your amendment to counter in NEGOTIATIONS? @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr
you do not represent eastern Washington! Get to work!!!
@SenateDems What he he done that goes against women?
We are so fortunate to have you represent us, Senator Murray!
tired of your meaness. women's health is not embodied in PP and his plan does not undermine women. your words do tho
You know Nothing has been signed into law #partisan/If either party says a crow is white, their party will follow
 suit! U take us 4 stupid
thank you!
@SenateDems only thing @TheDemocrats have proven is they do nothing and complain often vote them out recall them now @POTUS
Oh please. You know he didn't author that tweet.  He wouldn't use the "fabric" phrase.
Senator Murray - There's more at stake here than women's health. He needs to be impeached. NOW!
@SenateDems Senator he lies with thumbs and tongue
funny coming from the party of bill Clinton!
@SenateDems he actually didn't write this himself even. There are ways of knowing. Follow @RealRealDonaldT for his own tweets
Yes! Actions speak louder than words!
Sorry, while I have great respect for you, that ship sailed long ago. 45 has shown us how much disrespect he has for women.
you Senator are the case study of what drama is.
If one thing passes in this bill, I hope it's defunding planned parenthood!! A ripoff of American taxpayers!!
@SenateDems 
Lost doctor and insurance with obamauncare so get off high horse
PATTY, ACA COLLAPSING ALL BY ITSELF. COMMUNISM DOES NOT WORK..STOP LYING. 1/3 of ALL US counties-no ACA coverage
You can say it Senator - he's trying to take away legal abortion, and kill women in the process.
No Carol he is trying to take away "public funding" of legal abortion. If you think its not happening read more.
Obamacare was an absolute trainwreck, how about the democrats stop all the attacks and allow OUR @POTUS do his Job! #tiredofdemocrats
@SenateDems America is being SCROOGED.. Rs just want the old & sick to die... NOT cost effective !
@SenateDems This from a man who has destroyed the credibility and respect of the office of the President, he can't be believed!
Not to mention Trump's efforts to withdraw funding from Planned Parenthood.

@SenateDems LugenPotus
Love it!
Yes!
I hear you all whining since the election but you have no platform and no beliefs. What is it you want? Trump is the President.
#pantsonfire
Agreed, #trumpcare not significantly better than the disaster of #Obamacare
@realDonaldTrump he was kidding.  sorry.
What exactly is he taking away from women's health?
@realDonaldTrump 
He's already shown this a lie, Senator. An offer to "prove it" is only an invitation to further posturing.
he doesn't believe it which is why he had someone else write and tweet it from different phone
He didn't write the tweet, but he forgot to mention he is handing out Tic-Tac refills today. #InternationalWomensDay
Senator, Dems have a great opportunity right now to present single-payer and drive the conversation. Please get up and fight!
Single payer
Yes, thank you. Words are meaningless without any actions.Just like his supporters that say they are Christians & laugh at poor
Amen, Senator Murray. Also stop grabbing pussies whenever you want without asking. Not respectful. Not welcome. Ty.
oh he can't prove it. it's a load of manure. #trumpcare
